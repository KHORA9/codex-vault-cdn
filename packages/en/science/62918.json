Neill._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nFIFTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology, now deservedly one of the most popular and attractive of\r\nthe physical sciences, was, not many years ago, held in little\r\nestimation; and even at present, there are not wanting some who\r\ndo not hesitate to maintain, that it is a mere tissue of ill\r\nobserved phenomena, and of hypotheses of boundless extravagance.\r\nThe work of CUVIER now laid before the public, contains in itself\r\nnot only a complete answer to these ignorant imputations, but\r\nalso demonstrates the accuracy, extent, and importance of many of\r\nthe facts and reasonings of this delightful branch of Natural\r\nHistory. Can it be maintained of a science, which requires for its\r\nsuccessful prosecution an intimate acquaintance with Chemistry,\r\nNatural Philosophy and Astronomy,--with the details and views of\r\nZoology, Botany, and Mineralogy, and which connects these different\r\ndepartments of knowledge in a most interesting and striking\r\nmanner,--that it is of no value? Can it be maintained of Geology,\r\nwhich discloses to us the history of the first origin of organic\r\nbeings, and traces their gradual development from the monade to man\r\nhimself,--which enumerates and describes the changes that plants,\r\nanimals, and minerals--the atmosphere, and the waters of the\r\nglobe--have undergone from the earliest geological periods up to our\r\nown time, and which even instructs us in the earliest history of the\r\nhuman species,--that it offers no gratification to the philosopher?\r\nCan even those who estimate the value of science, not by intellectual\r\ndesires, but by practical advantages, deny the importance of\r\nGeology, certainly one of the foundations of agriculture, and\r\nwhich enables us to search out materials for numberless important\r\neconomical purposes?\r\n\r\nGeology took its rise in the Academy of Freyberg, with the\r\nillustrious WERNER, to whom we owe its present interesting condition.\r\nThis being the case, we ought not, (as is at present too much the\r\npractice), amidst the numerous discoveries in the mineral kingdom\r\nwhich have been made since the system of investigation of that\r\ngreat interpreter of nature was made known, forget the master, and\r\narrogate all to ourselves. In this Island, Geology first took firm\r\nroot in the north: in Edinburgh the Wernerian geognostical views and\r\nmethod of investigation, combined with the theory of HUTTON, the\r\nexperiments and speculations of HALL, the illustrations of PLAYFAIR,\r\nand the labours of the Royal and Wernerian Natural History Societies,\r\nexcited a spirit of inquiry which rapidly spread throughout the\r\nEmpire; and now Great Britain presents to the scientific world\r\na scene of geological acuteness, activity, and enterprise, not\r\nsurpassed in any other country.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent the writings of CUVIER, distinguished equally by\r\npurity and beauty of style, and profound learning, have proved\r\neminently useful in aiding the progress of Geology. In this country\r\nCUVIER was first made known as a geologist by the publication of the\r\npresent essay, which, from its unexampled popularity, has made his\r\nname as familiar to us as that of the most distinguished of our own\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\n      ROBERT JAMESON.\r\n\r\n  COLLEGE MUSEUM, EDINBURGH,\r\n  _25th November 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nFOURTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Fourth Edition of the celebrated Essay on the Theory of the\r\nEarth, contains, besides many additional facts and statements in\r\nregard to the Natural History of the Earth, also learned discussions\r\nby CUVIER, on the newness of the present continents, as confirmed by\r\nthe history of nations; and on the proofs regarding the antiquity\r\nof nations alleged to be contained in their astronomical and other\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\n      ROBERT JAMESON.\r\n\r\n  COLLEGE MUSEUM, EDINBURGH,\r\n  _2d April 1822_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fossil organic remains are the relics of a primeval world long\r\n  since gone past, proclaiming with a loud voice the instability\r\n  of earthly affairs, and impressing upon the minds of those who\r\n  seriously consider them, sentiments of piety and feelings of\r\n  devotion. If the antiquary digs from among the ruins of Herculaneum\r\n  a piece of ancient money, a vase, or a statue, we rejoice with\r\n  him, in finding the mode of life, the manners and arts of an\r\n  ancient people, placed before our eyes: If he finds an old record,\r\n  illustrative of the history of his country, however limited in\r\n  extent that country may be, we are grateful to him for the particle\r\n  of knowledge he has added to our store; but if, among the ruins\r\n  of the common country of the human race, we linger at the great\r\n  sepulchre of animated beings destroyed by the hand of fate, who\r\n  can look upon it without sentiments of piety! It is not here the\r\n  statues of Polycletus that we admire, but the admirable monuments\r\n  of the workmanship of Nature, taken from the ruins of the great\r\n  Herculeum overwhelmed by the ocean, that we look upon with feelings\r\n  of the deepest wonder and devotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nTHIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of naturalists was early directed to the investigation\r\nof the fossil organic remains so generally and abundantly distributed\r\nthroughout the strata of which the crust of the Earth is composed.\r\nIt is not, as some writers now imagine, entirely a modern study;\r\nfor even so early as the time of Leibnitz, we find that philosopher\r\ndrawing and describing fossil bones. After this period it continued\r\nto interest individuals, and engage the particular attention of\r\nsocieties and academies. The Royal Society of London, by the Memoirs\r\nof Sloane, Collinson, Lister, Derham, Baker, Grew, Hunter, Jacobs,\r\nPlott, Camper, and many others, afforded satisfactory proofs of the\r\nimportance attached to this branch of Natural History by philosophers\r\nin England; and the Memoirs of M. Graydon, in the Transactions of\r\nthe Royal Irish Academy, shew that it was not entirely neglected\r\nin Ireland. On the continent of Europe the natural history of\r\npetrifactions was also much studied, as appears from the Memoirs of\r\nHollman, Beckman, and Blumenbach, in the Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety of Gottingen;--of Gmelin, Pallas, Herrmann, Chappe, in the\r\nMemoirs of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Petersburg;--of\r\nGeoffroi, Buffon, Daubenton, Faujas St Fond, and others of the old\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences;--of Astruc and Riviere, of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Montpellier;--of Collini of the Academia\r\nTheodoro-Palatina, at Manheim, &c. But the geognostical relations\r\nof the rocks in which these organic remains are contained were but\r\nill understood, until Werner pointed out the mode of investigating\r\nthem. His interesting and important views were circulated from\r\nFreyberg, by the writings and conversations of his pupils, and have\r\ncontributed materially to the advancement of this branch of Natural\r\nHistory in Germany, France, and also in Great Britain. Petrifactions\r\nare no longer viewed as objects of mere curiosity, as things isolated\r\nand unrelated to the rocks of which the crust of the Earth is\r\ncomposed; on the contrary, they are now considered as one of the\r\nmost important features in the strata of all regions of the earth.\r\nBy the regularity and determinate nature of their distribution, they\r\nafford characters which assist us in discriminating not only single\r\nbeds, but also whole formations of rocks; and in this respect they\r\nare highly interesting to the geognostical inquirer. To the geologist\r\nthis beautiful branch of Natural History opens up numerous and\r\nuncommonly curious views of nature in the mineral kingdom: it shews\r\nhim the commencement of the formation of organic beings,--it points\r\nout the gradual succession in the formation of animals, from the\r\nalmost primeval coral near the primitive strata, through all the\r\nwonderful variety of form and structure observed in shells, fishes,\r\namphibious animals, and birds, to the perfect quadruped of the\r\nalluvial land; and it makes him acquainted with a geographical and\r\nphysical distribution of organic beings in the strata of the globe,\r\nvery different from what is observed to hold in the present state\r\nof the organic world. The zoologist views with wonder and amazement\r\nthose hosts of fossil animals, sometimes so similar to the present\r\nliving species, at other times so far removed from them in form and\r\nstructure. He compares the fossil orders, genera and species, with\r\nthose now inhabiting the earth’s surface, or living in its waters,\r\nand discovers that there is a whole system of animals in a fossil\r\nstate different from the present. Even the physiologist, in the\r\nvarious forms, connections, and relations of the parts of those\r\nanimals, obtains new facts for his descriptions and reasonings.\r\nSuch, then, being the nature of this branch of Natural History, it\r\nis not surprising that, when once understood, it should have many\r\nand zealous cultivators, and occupy the talents of men of learning\r\nand sagacity. In our time, Cuvier, the celebrated Professor of\r\nNatural History in Paris, has eminently distinguished himself by his\r\nnumerous discoveries, accurate descriptions, and rational views, on\r\nthis subject. His great work on Fossil Organic Remains, of which a\r\nnew edition is now in progress, is the most splendid contribution to\r\nNatural History furnished by any individual of this age.\r\n\r\nThe Essay on the Theory of the Earth, now translated, is the\r\nintroductory part of the great work of Cuvier. The subject of\r\nthe _deluge_ forms a principal object of this elegant discourse.\r\nAfter describing the principal results at which the theory of the\r\nearth, in his opinion, has arrived, he next mentions the various\r\nrelations which connect the history of the fossil bones of land\r\nanimals with these results; explains the principles on which is\r\nfounded the art of ascertaining these bones, or, in other words, of\r\ndiscovering a genus, and of distinguishing a species, by a single\r\nfragment of bone: and gives a rapid sketch of the results to which\r\nhis researches lead, of the new genera and species which these have\r\nbeen the means of discovering, and of the different formations in\r\nwhich they are contained. Some naturalists, as Lamarck, having\r\nmaintained that the present existing races of quadrupeds are mere\r\nmodifications or varieties of those ancient races which we now find\r\nin a fossil state, modifications which may have been produced by\r\nchange of climate, and other local circumstances, and since brought\r\nto the present great difference, by the operation of similar causes\r\nduring a long succession of ages,--Cuvier shews that the difference\r\nbetween the fossil species and those which now exist, is bounded by\r\ncertain limits; that these limits are a great deal more extensive\r\nthan those which now distinguish the varieties of the same species,\r\nand consequently, that the extinct species of quadrupeds are not\r\nvarieties of the presently existing species. This very interesting\r\ndiscussion naturally leads our author to state the proofs of the\r\nrecent population of the world; of the comparatively modern origin\r\nof its present surface; of the deluge, and the subsequent renewal of\r\nhuman society.\r\n\r\nIn order to render this Essay more complete and satisfactory, I have\r\nillustrated the whole with an extensive series of observations,\r\nand have arranged them in such a manner that they will be readily\r\naccessible, not only to the naturalist, but also to the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the former edition of this Essay, many\r\ncurious discoveries have been made in regard to fossil organic\r\nremains:--some of these are included in the Illustrations at the end\r\nof the Essay, others want of room forces us to omit.\r\n\r\n      R.

In\r\npursuing this object, I had to follow a path in which but little\r\nprogress had hitherto been made. As an antiquary of a new order, I\r\nwas obliged at once to learn the art of restoring these monuments\r\nof past revolutions to their original forms, and to discover\r\ntheir nature and relations; I had to collect and bring together\r\nin their original order, the fragments of which they consisted;\r\nto reconstruct, as it were, the ancient beings to which these\r\nfragments belonged; to reproduce them with all their proportions\r\nand characters; and, lastly, to compare them with those which now\r\nlive at the surface of the globe:--an art almost unknown, and which\r\npresupposed a science whose first developments had scarcely yet been\r\ntraced, that of the laws which regulate the co-existence of the\r\nforms of the different parts in organised beings. I had therefore to\r\nprepare myself for these inquiries, by others of a far more extensive\r\nkind, respecting the animals which still exist. Nothing, except an\r\nalmost complete review of creation in its present state, could give\r\na character of demonstration to the results of my investigation into\r\nits ancient state; but, from this review, I had at the same time to\r\nexpect a great body of rules and affinities not less satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrated; and it became obvious, that, in consequence of this\r\nessay upon a small portion of the theory of the earth, the whole\r\nanimal kingdom would necessarily be in some measure subjected to new\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThus I was encouraged in this twofold investigation, by the equal\r\ninterest which it promised to possess, both with regard to the\r\ngeneral science of anatomy, the essential basis of all those which\r\ntreat of organised bodies, and with regard to the physical history of\r\nthe globe, the foundation of mineralogy, geography, and even, it may\r\nbe said, of the history of Man, and of all that it most concerns him\r\nto know with regard to himself.\r\n\r\nIf it be so interesting to us to follow, in the infancy of our\r\nspecies, the almost obliterated traces of extinct nations, why should\r\nit not also be so, to search, amid the darkness of the infancy of the\r\nEarth, for the traces of revolutions which have taken place anterior\r\nto the existence of all nations? We admire the power by which the\r\nhuman mind has measured the motions of the celestial bodies, which\r\nnature seemed to have concealed for ever from our view. Genius and\r\nscience have burst the limits of space; and observations, explained\r\nby just reasoning, have unveiled the mechanism of the universe. Would\r\nit not also be glorious for man to burst the limits of time, and, by\r\nmeans of observations, to ascertain the history of this world, and\r\nthe succession of events which preceded the birth of the human race?\r\nAstronomers have undoubtedly advanced more rapidly than naturalists;\r\nand the present period, with respect to the Theory of the Earth,\r\nbears some resemblance to that in which some philosophers fancied\r\nthat the heavens were formed of polished stones, and that the moon\r\nwas of the size of the Peloponnesus; but after ANAXAGORAS, came\r\nCOPERNICUS and KEPLER, who pointed the way to NEWTON; and why should\r\nnot natural history also one day have its Newton?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plan of this Essay._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I especially propose to present in this discourse, is the plan\r\nand the result of my labours regarding Fossil Bones. I shall also\r\nattempt to trace a rapid sketch of the efforts that have been made up\r\nto the present day, to restore the history of the revolutions of the\r\nglobe. The facts which I have been enabled to discover, form, without\r\ndoubt, only a small portion of those which would be necessary to\r\ncomplete this ancient history; but several of them lead to decisive\r\nconsequences, and the rigorous manner in which I have proceeded in\r\ntheir determination, affords me reason to think that they will be\r\nregarded as points definitively fixed, and which in their aggregate\r\nwill form an epoch in science. Lastly, I trust their novelty will be\r\na sufficient excuse for me, if I claim for them the earnest attention\r\nof my readers.\r\n\r\nMy object will first be to shew by what relations the history of\r\nthe fossil bones of terrestrial animals connects itself with the\r\ntheory of the earth, and for what reasons a peculiar importance is\r\nto be attributed to it, with reference to this subject. I shall then\r\nunfold the principles upon which is founded the art of determining\r\nthese bones, or, in other words, of recognizing a genus, and of\r\ndistinguishing a species, by a single fragment of bone,--an art, on\r\nthe certainty of which depends that of my whole work, I shall give a\r\nrapid account of the new species, and of genera previously unknown,\r\nwhich the application of these principles has led me to discover, as\r\nwell as the different kinds of deposits in which they are contained.\r\nAnd as the difference between these species and those which exist\r\nat the present day is bounded by certain limits, I shall show that\r\nthese limits much exceed those which now distinguish the varieties of\r\nthe same species. I shall therefore make known to what extent these\r\nvarieties may go, whether from the influence of time, or from that of\r\nclimate, or, lastly, from that of domestication.\r\n\r\nIn this way I shall be enabled to conclude, and to induce my readers\r\nto conclude with me, that great events were necessary to produce\r\nthe more considerable differences which I have discovered. I shall\r\nnext mention the particular modifications which my researches must\r\nnecessarily introduce into the hitherto received opinions regarding\r\nthe revolutions of the globe; and, lastly, I shall inquire how far\r\nthe civil and religious history of different nations corresponds\r\nwith the results of observation with regard to the physical history\r\nof the Earth, and with the probabilities which these observations\r\nafford concerning the period at which societies of men may have found\r\nfixed places of abode, and fields susceptible of cultivation, and at\r\nwhich, therefore, they may have assumed a durable form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Appearance of the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller passes over those fertile plains where gently\r\nflowing streams nourish in their course an abundant vegetation, and\r\nwhere the soil, inhabited by a numerous population, adorned with\r\nflourishing villages, opulent cities, and superb monuments, is never\r\ndisturbed, except by the ravages of war, or by the oppression of\r\nthe powerful, he is not led to suspect that Nature also has had her\r\nintestine wars, and that the surface of the globe has been broken\r\nup by revolutions and catastrophes. But his ideas change as soon as\r\nhe digs into that soil which now presents so peaceful an aspect, or\r\nascends to the hills which border the plain; his ideas are expanded,\r\nif I may use the expression, in proportion to the expansion of the\r\nview, and begin to embrace the full extent and grandeur of those\r\nancient events, when he climbs the more elevated chains, whose base\r\nis skirted by these hills, or when, by following the beds of the\r\ntorrents which descend from those chains, he penetrates, as it were,\r\ninto their interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_First proofs of Revolutions on the surface of the Globe._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lowest and most level parts of the earth, exhibit nothing,\r\neven when penetrated to a very great depth, but horizontal strata\r\ncomposed of substances more or less varied, and containing almost\r\nall of them innumerable marine productions. Similar strata, with the\r\nsame kind of productions, compose the lesser hills to a considerable\r\nheight. Sometimes the shells are so numerous as to constitute of\r\nthemselves the entire mass of the rock; they rise to elevations\r\nsuperior to the level of every part of the ocean, and are found in\r\nplaces where no sea could have carried them at the present day, under\r\nany circumstances; they are not only enveloped in loose sand, but are\r\noften inclosed in the hardest rocks. Every part of the earth, every\r\nhemisphere, every continent, every island of any extent, exhibits the\r\nsame phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe times are past when ignorance could maintain, that these remains\r\nof organized bodies are mere sportings of nature, productions\r\ngenerated in the womb of the Earth, by its own creative powers; and\r\nthe efforts made by some metaphysicians of the present day, will\r\nnot probably succeed in bringing these exploded opinions again into\r\nrepute. A scrupulous comparison of the forms of these remains, of\r\ntheir texture, and often even of their chemical composition, does\r\nnot disclose the slightest difference between the fossil shells and\r\nthose which still inhabit the sea: the preservation of the former is\r\nnot less perfect than that of the latter; most commonly we neither\r\nobserve detrition nor fracture in them, nothing, in short, that\r\nannounces a violent removal from their original places; the smallest\r\nof them retain their sharpest ridges, and their most delicate spines.\r\nThey have, therefore, not only lived in the sea, but they have also\r\nbeen deposited by it. It is the sea which has left them in the places\r\nwhere they are now found. But this sea has remained for a certain\r\nperiod in those places; it has covered them long enough, and with\r\nsufficient tranquillity to form those deposits, so regular, so thick,\r\nso extensive, and partly also so solid, which contain those remains\r\nof aquatic animals. The basin of the sea has therefore undergone\r\none change at least, either in extent, or in situation. Such is\r\nthe result of the very first search, and of the most superficial\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe traces of revolutions become still more apparent and decisive,\r\nwhen we ascend a little higher, and approach nearer to the foot of\r\nthe great chains. There are still found many beds of shells; some\r\nof these are even thicker and more solid; the shells are quite as\r\nnumerous, and as well preserved, but they are no longer of the\r\nsame species. The strata which contain them are not so generally\r\nhorizontal; they assume an oblique position, and are sometimes almost\r\nvertical. While in the plains and low hills it was necessary to dig\r\ndeep, in order to discover the succession of the beds, we here\r\ndiscover it at once by their exposed edges, as we follow the valleys\r\nthat have been produced by their disjunction. Great masses of debris\r\nform at the foot of the cliffs, rounded hills, the height of which is\r\naugmented by every thaw and tempest.\r\n\r\nThese inclined strata, which form the ridges of the secondary\r\nmountains, do not rest upon the horizontal strata of the hills\r\nwhich are situate at their base, and which form the first steps in\r\napproaching them; but, on the contrary, dip under them, while the\r\nhills in question rest upon their declivities. When we dig through\r\nthe horizontal strata in the vicinity of mountains whose strata\r\nare inclined, we find these inclined strata re-appearing below;\r\nand even sometimes, when the inclined strata are not too elevated,\r\ntheir summit is crowned by horizontal ones[1]. The inclined strata\r\nare therefore older than the horizontal strata; and as they must\r\nnecessarily, at least the greater number of them, have been formed in\r\na horizontal position, it is evident that they have been raised[2],\r\nand that this change in their direction has been effected before the\r\nothers were superimposed upon them[3].\r\n\r\nThus the sea, previous to the deposition of the horizontal strata,\r\nhad formed others, which, by the operation of problematical causes,\r\nwere broken, raised, and overturned in a thousand ways; and, as\r\nseveral of those inclined strata which it had formed at more remote\r\nperiods, rise higher than the horizontal strata which have succeeded\r\nthem, and which surround them, the causes by which the inclination\r\nof these beds was effected, had also made them project above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and formed islands of them, or at least shoals and\r\ninequalities; and this must have happened, whether they had been\r\nraised by one extremity, or whether the depression of the opposite\r\nextremity had made the waters subside. This is the second result, not\r\nless clear, nor less satisfactorily demonstrated, than the first, to\r\nevery one who will take the trouble of examining the monuments on\r\nwhich it is established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs that such revolutions have been numerous._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is not to this subversion of the ancient strata, nor to this\r\nretreat of the sea after the formation of the new strata, that the\r\nrevolutions and changes which have given rise to the present state of\r\nthe Earth are limited.\r\n\r\nWhen we institute a more detailed comparison between the various\r\nstrata and those remains of animals which they contain, we presently\r\nperceive, that this ancient sea has not always deposited mineral\r\nsubstances of the same kind, nor remains of animals of the same\r\nspecies; and that each of its deposits has not extended over the\r\nwhole surface which it covered. There has existed a succession of\r\nvariations; the former of which alone have been more or less general,\r\nwhile the others appear to have been much less so. The older the\r\nstrata are, the more uniform is each of them over a great extent; the\r\nnewer they are, the more limited are they, and the more subject to\r\nvary at small distances. Thus the displacements of the strata were\r\naccompanied and followed by changes in the nature of the fluid, and\r\nof the matters which it held in solution; and when certain strata, by\r\nmaking their appearance above the waters, had divided the surface of\r\nthe seas by islands and projecting ridges, different changes might\r\ntake place in particular basins.\r\n\r\nAmidst these variations in the nature of the general fluid, it\r\nis evident, that the animals which lived in it could not remain\r\nthe same. Their species, and even their genera, changed with the\r\nstrata; and, although the same species occasionally recur at small\r\ndistances, it may be announced as a general truth, that the shells\r\nof the ancient strata have forms peculiar to themselves; that they\r\ngradually disappear, so as no longer to be seen at all in the recent\r\nstrata, and still less in the presently existing ocean, in which\r\ntheir corresponding species are never discovered, and where several,\r\neven of their genera, do not occur: that, on the contrary, the shells\r\nof the recent strata are similar, in respect to their genera, to\r\nthose which exist in our seas; and that, in the latest and least\r\nconsolidated of these strata, and in certain recent and limited\r\ndeposits, there are some species which the most experienced eye could\r\nnot distinguish from those which are found in the neighbouring seas.\r\n\r\nThere has, therefore, been a succession of variations in the economy\r\nof organic nature, which has been occasioned by those of the fluid\r\nin which the animals lived, or which has at least corresponded with\r\nthem; and these variations have gradually conducted the classes of\r\naquatic animals to their present state, till, at length, at the time\r\nwhen the sea retired from our continents for the last time, its\r\ninhabitants did not differ much from those which are found in it at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nWe say for the _last_ time, because, if we examine with still greater\r\ncare those remains of organised bodies, we discover, in the midst\r\nof even the oldest strata of marine formation, other strata replete\r\nwith animal or vegetable remains of terrestrial or fresh-water\r\nproductions; and, amongst the more recent strata, or, in other\r\nwords, those that are nearest the surface, there are some in which\r\nland animals are buried under heaps of marine productions. Thus, the\r\nvarious catastrophes which have disturbed the strata, have not only\r\ncaused the different parts of our continents to rise by degrees from\r\nthe bosom of the waves, and diminished the extent of the basin of\r\nthe ocean, but have also given rise to numerous shiftings of this\r\nbasin. It has frequently happened, that lands which have been laid\r\ndry, have been again covered by the waters, in consequence either\r\nof their being ingulphed in the abyss, or of the sea having merely\r\nrisen over them. The particular portions also, of the Earth, which\r\nthe sea abandoned in its last retreat,--those which are now inhabited\r\nby man and terrestrial animals,--had already been once laid dry,\r\nand had then afforded subsistence to quadrupeds, birds, plants, and\r\nland productions of all kinds: the sea which left it had, therefore,\r\ncovered it at a previous period[4].\r\n\r\nThe changes in the level of the waters have not, therefore, consisted\r\nsolely in a more or less gradual, or more or less general retreat;\r\nthere have been various successive irruptions and retreats, the final\r\nresult of which, however, has been a universal depression of the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs that these Revolutions have been sudden._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of much importance to remark, that these repeated irruptions\r\nand retreats of the sea have neither all been slow nor gradual;\r\non the contrary, most of the catastrophes which have occasioned\r\nthem have been sudden; and this is especially easy to be proved,\r\nwith regard to the last of these catastrophes, that which, by a\r\ntwo-fold motion, has inundated, and afterwards laid dry, our present\r\ncontinents, or at least a part of the land which forms them at the\r\npresent day. In the northern regions, it has left the carcases of\r\nlarge quadrupeds which became enveloped in the ice, and have thus\r\nbeen preserved even to our own times, with their skin, their hair,\r\nand their flesh. If they had not been frozen as soon as killed,\r\nthey would have been decomposed by putrefaction. And, on the other\r\nhand, this eternal frost could not previously have occupied the\r\nplaces in which they have been seized by it, for they could not\r\nhave lived in such a temperature. It was, therefore, at one and the\r\nsame moment that these animals were destroyed, and the country\r\nwhich they inhabited became covered with ice. This event has been\r\nsudden, instantaneous, without any gradation; and what is so clearly\r\ndemonstrated with respect to this last catastrophe, is not less so\r\nwith reference to those which have preceded it. The breaking to\r\npieces, the raising up and overturning of the older strata, leave\r\nno doubt upon the mind that they have been reduced to the state in\r\nwhich we now see them, by the action of sudden and violent causes;\r\nand even the force of the motions excited in the mass of waters, is\r\nstill attested by the heaps of debris and rounded pebbles which are\r\nin many places interposed between the solid strata. Life, therefore,\r\nhas often been disturbed on this earth by terrible events. Numberless\r\nliving beings have been the victims of these catastrophes; some,\r\nwhich inhabited the dry land, have been swallowed up by inundations;\r\nothers, which peopled the waters, have been laid dry, from the bottom\r\nof the sea having been suddenly raised; their very races have been\r\nextinguished for ever, and have left no other memorial of their\r\nexistence than some fragments, which the naturalist can scarcely\r\nrecognize.\r\n\r\nSuch are the conclusions to which we are necessarily led by the\r\nobjects that we meet with at every step, and which we can always\r\nverify, by examples drawn from almost every country. These great\r\nand terrible events are every where distinctly recorded, so as to be\r\nalways legible by the eye skilled to decypher their history in the\r\nmonuments which they have left behind.\r\n\r\nBut what is still more astonishing and not less certain, _life_ has\r\nnot always existed upon the globe; and it is easy for the observer\r\nto distinguish the point at which it has begun to deposit its\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs that there have been Revolutions anterior to the existence of\r\nliving beings._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we ascend to higher points of elevation, and advance towards the\r\ngreat ridges, the craggy summits of the mountain chains, we shall\r\npresently find those remains of marine animals, those innumerable\r\nshells, of which we have spoken, becoming more rare, and at length\r\ndisappearing altogether. We arrive at strata of a different nature,\r\nwhich contain no vestiges of living beings. Nevertheless, their\r\ncrystallization, and even their stratification, shew that they have\r\nbeen also in a liquid state at their formation; their inclined\r\nposition, and the cliffs into which they are broken, shew that they\r\nalso have been forcibly moved from their original places; the oblique\r\nmanner in which they dip under the shelly strata, that they have been\r\nformed previously to these latter; and lastly, the height to which\r\ntheir rugged and bare peaks rise above all these shelly strata, that\r\ntheir summits had already emerged from the waters, when the shelly\r\nstrata were forming.\r\n\r\nSuch are those celebrated Primitive Mountains which traverse our\r\ncontinents in different directions, raising themselves above the\r\nclouds, separating the basins of rivers from one another, affording,\r\nin their perennial snows, reservoirs which feed the springs, and\r\nforming, in some measure, the skeleton, and as it were the rough\r\nframework, of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe eye perceives from afar, in the indentations with which their\r\nridge has been marked, and in the sharp peaks with which it is\r\nbristled, indications of the violent manner in which they have been\r\nelevated. Their appearance, in this respect, is very different from\r\nthat of those rounded mountains, and hills with long flat surfaces,\r\nwhose less ancient masses have always remained in the situation in\r\nwhich they were quietly deposited by the waters of more recent seas.\r\n\r\nThese indications become more obvious as we approach. The valleys\r\nhave no longer those gently-sloping sides, those salient and\r\nre-entering angles corresponding on either side to each other, which\r\nseem to denote the beds of ancient streams. They widen and they\r\ncontract without any general rule; their waters, at one time, expand\r\ninto lakes; at another, fall in torrents; and sometimes their rocks,\r\nsuddenly approaching from each side, form transverse dikes, over\r\nwhich the waters tumble in cataracts. The dissevered strata, while\r\nthey shew on one side their edges perpendicularly raised, on the\r\nother present large portions of their surface lying obliquely; they\r\ndo not correspond in height, but those which, on one side, form the\r\nsummit of the cliff, often dip underneath on the other, and are no\r\nlonger visible.\r\n\r\nYet, amidst all this confusion, distinguished naturalists have\r\nbeen able to demonstrate, that there still reigns a certain order,\r\nand that those immense deposits, broken and overturned though they\r\nbe, observe a regular succession with regard to each other, which\r\nis nearly the same in all the great mountain chains. According to\r\nthem, Granite, of which the central ridges of the greater number of\r\nthese chains consist, and which thus surmounts every other rock,\r\nis also the rock which is found deepest in the solid crust of the\r\nglobe. It is the most ancient of those which we have found means of\r\nexamining in the place assigned them by nature; and we inquire not\r\nat present, whether it owes its origin to a general fluid, which\r\nformerly held every thing in solution, or may have been the first\r\nconsolidated by the cooling of a great mass in fusion, or even in a\r\nstate of vapour[5]. Foliated rocks rest upon its sides, and form\r\nthe lateral ridges of these great chains; schists, porphyries,\r\nsandstones, and talcose rocks, intermingle with their strata; lastly,\r\ngranular marbles, and other limestones destitute of shells, resting\r\nupon the schists, form the outer ridges, the lower steps as it were,\r\nthe counterforts, of these chains, and are the last formations, by\r\nwhich this unknown fluid, this sea without inhabitants, would seem to\r\nhave prepared materials for the mollusca and zoophytes, which were\r\npresently to deposite upon these foundations vast heaps of their\r\nshells and corals.\r\n\r\nWe even find the first productions of these mollusca and zoophytes\r\nappearing in small numbers, and scattered at greater or less\r\ndistances, in the last strata of these primitive formations, or in\r\nthat portion of the crust of the globe to which geologists have\r\ngiven the name of Transition rocks. Here and there we meet with beds\r\ncontaining shells, interposed between certain granites of later\r\nformation than the others, between schists of various kinds, and\r\nbetween some newer beds of granular marbles. Life, which was in\r\nthe end to obtain entire possession of the globe, seems, in these\r\nprimordial times, to have struggled with the inert nature which\r\nformerly predominated; and it was not until a considerable time\r\nafter, that it obtained the ascendancy over it, and acquired for\r\nitself the exclusive right of continuing and elevating the solid\r\nenvelope of the Earth.\r\n\r\nHence, it is impossible to deny, that the masses which now constitute\r\nour highest mountains, have been originally in a liquid state; and\r\nthat they have for a long time been covered by waters in which\r\nno living beings existed. Thus, it has not been only since the\r\nappearance of life that changes have been operated in the nature of\r\nthe matters which have been deposited; for the masses formed previous\r\nto that event, have varied, as well as those which have been formed\r\nsince. They have also experienced violent changes in their position,\r\nand a part of these changes must have taken place at the period when\r\nthese masses existed by themselves, and were not covered over by\r\nthe shelly masses. The proof of this lies in the overturnings, the\r\ndisruptions, and the fissures, which are observable in their strata,\r\nas well as in those of more recent formations, and which are in the\r\nancient strata even in greater number and better defined.\r\n\r\nBut these primitive masses have also undergone other revolutions\r\nsince the formation of the secondary strata, and have, perhaps,\r\ngiven rise to, or at least have partaken of, some of those changes\r\nwhich these strata themselves have experienced. There are actually\r\nconsiderable portions of the primitive formations uncovered, although\r\nplaced in lower situations than many of the secondary formations;\r\nand we cannot conceive how it should have so happened, unless the\r\nprimitive strata in those places had forced themselves into view,\r\nafter the secondary strata had been formed. In certain countries, we\r\nfind numerous large blocks of primitive substances scattered over\r\nthe surface of secondary formations, and separated by deep valleys,\r\nor even by arms of the sea, from the peaks or ridges from which they\r\nmust have been derived. We must necessarily conclude, therefore,\r\neither that these blocks have been ejected by eruptions, or that the\r\nvalleys (which must have stopped their course) did not exist at the\r\ntime of their being transported; or, lastly, that the motions of the\r\nwaters by which they were transported, exceeded in violence any thing\r\nthat we can imagine at the present day[6].\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we have a collection of facts, a series of epochs,\r\nanterior to the present time, of which the successive steps may\r\nbe perfectly ascertained, although the duration of their intervals\r\ncannot be defined with precision. They are so many fixed points,\r\nwhich serve to regulate and direct our inquiries respecting this\r\nancient chronology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Examination of the Causes which act at present on the surface of the\r\nGlobe._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now examine those changes which are taking place at the\r\npresent day upon the globe, investigating the causes which still act\r\nin its surface, and endeavouring to determine the possible extent\r\nof their effects. This portion of the history of the Earth is so\r\nmuch the more important, that it has long been considered possible\r\nto explain the more ancient revolutions on its surface by means of\r\nthese still existing causes; in the same manner as it is found easy\r\nto explain past events in political history, by an acquaintance\r\nwith the passions and intrigues of the present day. But we shall\r\npresently see, that unfortunately the case is different in physical\r\nhistory:--the thread of operations is here broken; the march of\r\nNature is changed; and none of the agents which she now employs,\r\nwould have been sufficient for the production of her ancient works.\r\n\r\nThere still exist, however, four causes in full activity, which\r\ncontribute to alter the surface of our continents. These are, rains\r\nand thaws, which waste down the steep mountains, and precipitate the\r\nfragments to their bottoms; running waters, which carry off these\r\nfragments, and deposit them in places where their current is abated;\r\nthe sea, which undermines the foundations of elevated coasts, forming\r\nsteep cliffs, and which throws up great banks of sand upon the low\r\ncoasts; and, lastly, volcanoes, which pierce through the solid strata\r\nfrom below, elevate these strata, or spread over the surface vast\r\nquantities of ejected matter[7].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Slips, or Falling down of the Materials of Mountains._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every place where the broken strata present their edges on abrupt\r\nsurfaces, there fall down to their base, every spring, and even after\r\nevery storm, fragments of their materials, which are rounded by\r\nrolling upon each other. These collected heaps gradually assume an\r\ninclination determined by the laws of cohesion, and thus form, at the\r\nbottom of the cliff, taluses, of greater or less elevation, according\r\nas the fragments which have fallen are more or less abundant.\r\nThese taluses constitute the sides of the valleys in all elevated,\r\nmountainous regions, and are covered with a rich vegetation, whenever\r\nthe fragments from the upper parts begin to fall less abundantly;\r\nbut their want of solidity subjects themselves also to slips, when\r\nthey are undermined by rivulets. On these occasions, towns, and rich\r\nand populous districts, are sometimes buried under the ruins of a\r\nmountain; the courses of rivers are interrupted, and lakes are formed\r\nin places which were before the abodes of fertility and cheerfulness.\r\nFortunately these great slips happen but seldom, and the principal\r\nuse of those hills of debris, is to furnish materials for the ravages\r\nof torrents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alluvial Formations[8]._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rains which fall, the vapours which are condensed, and the\r\nsnows which are melted, upon the ridges and summits of mountains,\r\ndescend, by an infinite number of rills, along their slopes, carrying\r\nwith them some portions of the materials of which these slopes are\r\ncomposed, and tracing slight furrows by their passage. These rills\r\nsoon unite in the deeper gutters with which the surface is marked,\r\nrun off by the deep valleys which intersect their bottom, and thus\r\nform streams and rivers, which carry back to the sea the waters it\r\nhad formerly supplied to the atmosphere. On the melting of the snows,\r\nor when a storm takes place, these mountain torrents become suddenly\r\nswollen, and rush down the declivities with a velocity proportioned\r\nto their steepness. They dash violently against the bases of those\r\ntaluses of fallen fragments which cover the sides of all the high\r\nvalleys, carrying off the already rounded fragments of which they are\r\ncomposed, and which thus become smoothed, and still farther polished,\r\nby attrition. But in proportion as they reach the more level valleys,\r\nwhere their violence is diminished, or when they arrive at more\r\nexpanded basins, where their waters are permitted to spread, they\r\nthrow out upon their banks the largest of those stones which they had\r\nrolled down. The smaller fragments are deposited still lower; and\r\nnothing reaches the great canal of the river excepting the minutest\r\nparticles, or the most impalpable mud. It often happens, also, that\r\nbefore these streams unite to form great rivers, they have to pass\r\nthrough large and deep lakes, in which their mud is deposited, and\r\nfrom which their waters come forth limpid.\r\n\r\nThe lower rivers, and all the streams which descend from the less\r\nelevated mountains and hills, also produce effects, upon the\r\ndistricts through which they flow, more or less analogous to those of\r\nthe torrents from the higher mountains. When these rivers are swollen\r\nby great rains, they attack the base of the earthy or sandy hills\r\nwhich they meet with in their course, and carry their fragments to be\r\ndeposited upon the lower grounds, and which are thus, in some degree,\r\nraised by each succeeding inundation. Finally, when the rivers reach\r\ngreat lakes or the sea, and when that rapidity, which carried off\r\nand kept in suspension the particles of mud comes to cease entirely,\r\nthese particles are deposited at the sides of their mouths, where\r\nthey form low grounds, by which the shores are prolonged. And if\r\nthese shores are such, that the sea also throws up sand upon them,\r\nand thus contributes to their increase; there are created, as it\r\nwere, provinces, and even entire kingdoms, which usually become the\r\nmost fertile, and speedily the richest, in the world, if their rulers\r\npermit human industry to exert itself in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formation of Downs._[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects which the sea produces, without the co-operation of\r\nrivers, are much less beneficial. When the coast is low, and the\r\nbottom sandy, the waves push the sand toward the shore, where, at\r\nevery reflux of the tide, it becomes partially dried; and the wind,\r\nwhich almost always blows from the sea, drifts it upon the beach.\r\nThus are formed those hillocks of sand, named Downs, which, if the\r\nindustry of man does not fix them by suitable plants, move slowly,\r\nbut invariably, toward the interior of the country, and overwhelm\r\nfields and dwellings, because the same wind that raises the sand of\r\nthe beach upon the down, throws that of its summit in the opposite\r\ndirection from the sea. When the nature of the sand, and that of the\r\nwater which is raised with it, are such as to form a durable cement,\r\nthe shells and bones, thrown upon the beach, become incrusted with\r\nit. Pieces of wood, trunks of trees, and plants growing near the\r\nsea, are enveloped in these aggregates; and thus are produced what\r\nmight be denominated _indurated downs_, such as we see upon the\r\ncoasts of New Holland, and of which a precise idea may be formed from\r\nthe description given of them by Peron[10].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formation of Cliffs or Steep Shores._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the coast is high, the sea, which is thus\r\nprevented from throwing up any thing, exercises a destructive\r\naction upon it. Its waves, by sapping the foundation, cause the\r\nsuperincumbent portion of the face of the cliff, thus deprived of\r\nsupport, to be incessantly falling down in fragments. These fragments\r\nare tumbled about by the billows, until the softer and more divided\r\nparts disappear. The harder portions, from being rolled in contrary\r\ndirections, assume the form of boulders and pebbles; and these, at\r\nlength, accumulate in sufficient quantity to form a rampart, by which\r\nthe bottom of the cliff is protected against farther depredations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the action of water upon the solid land; and we see, that\r\nit consists almost entirely in reducing it to lower levels, but\r\nnot indefinitely. The fragments of the great mountain ridges are\r\ncarried down into the valleys; their finer particles, together with\r\nthose of the lower hills and plains, are borne to the sea; alluvial\r\ndepositions extend the coasts at the expence of the high grounds.\r\nThese are limited effects, to which vegetation in general puts a\r\nstop, and which, besides, presuppose the existence of mountains,\r\nvalleys, and plains, in short, all the inequalities of the globe; and\r\nwhich, therefore, cannot have given rise to these inequalities. The\r\nformation of downs is a phenomenon still more limited, both in regard\r\nto height and horizontal extent; and has no relation whatever to that\r\nof those enormous masses into the origin of which it is the object of\r\ngeology to inquire.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Depositions formed in Water._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot obtain a precise knowledge of the action exerted\r\nby water within its own bosom, it is yet possible to determine its\r\nlimits to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nLakes, pools, marshes, and sea-ports, into which rivulets discharge\r\ntheir waters, more especially when these descend from near and steep\r\nhills, deposit large quantities of mud, which would at length fill\r\nthem up entirely, if care were not taken to clean them out. The sea\r\nalso throws quantities of slime and sediment into harbours and\r\ncreeks; into all places, in short, where its waters are more tranquil\r\nthan ordinary. The currents also heap up at their meeting, or throw\r\nout at their sides, the sand which they are continually raising from\r\nthe bottom of the sea, forming it into banks and shallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stalactites._\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain waters, after dissolving calcareous substances by means of\r\nthe superabundant carbonic acid with which they are impregnated,\r\nallow these substances to crystallize after the acid has evaporated;\r\nand, in this manner, form stalactites, and other concretions. There\r\nare strata, confusedly crystallized in fresh water, which are\r\nsufficiently extensive to be compared with some of those which have\r\nbeen deposited by the ancient sea. The famous Travertine quarries\r\nof the neighbourhood of Rome, and the rocks of the same substance,\r\nwhich are formed, and continually varied in figure, by the river\r\nof Teverona, are generally known. These two modes of action may be\r\ncombined; the deposits accumulated by the sea may be solidified by\r\nstalactite. Thus, when springs abounding in calcareous matter, or\r\ncontaining some other substance in solution, happen to fall into\r\nplaces where these deposits are formed, we then find aggregates in\r\nwhich marine and fresh-water productions may be blended. Of this\r\ndescription are the banks in the island of Guadeloupe, which, along\r\nwith human skeletons, present land and sea shells mingled together.\r\nOf the same nature also is the quarry described by Saussure, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Messina, in which the sandstone is seen forming by\r\nthe consolidation of the sand thrown up by the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lithophytes._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the torrid zone, where lithophytes of many species abound, and are\r\npropagated with great rapidity, their strong trunks are interwoven\r\nand accumulated so as to form rocks and reefs; and rising even to\r\nthe surface of the water, shut up the entrance of harbours, and lay\r\nfrightful snares for navigators. The sea, throwing up sand and mud\r\nupon the tops of these shoals, sometimes raises their surface above\r\nits own level, and forms islands, which are soon covered with a rich\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Incrustation._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also possible, that, in particular places, large quantities\r\nof the animals inhabiting shells, leave their stony coverings when\r\nthey die, and that these, cemented together by slime of greater or\r\nless consistence, or by other cementing substances, form extensive\r\ndeposits or shell banks. But we have no evidence that the sea can now\r\nincrust those shells with a paste as compact as that of the marbles,\r\nthe sandstones, or even the coarse limestone (calcaire grossier) in\r\nwhich we see the shells of our strata enveloped. Still less do we any\r\nwhere find the sea depositing those more solid and more siliceous\r\nstrata which have preceded the formation of the shelly strata.\r\n\r\nIn short, all these causes united, would not change, in an\r\nappreciable degree, the level of the sea; nor raise a single stratum\r\nabove its surface; and still less would they produce the smallest\r\nhillock upon the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the sea has undergone a general diminution\r\nof level; and proofs of this are said to have been discovered in some\r\nparts of the shores of the Baltic.[12] But whatever may be the causes\r\nof these appearances, we are certain that they are not general in\r\ntheir operation; and that, in the greater number of harbours, where\r\nany alteration of the level would be a matter of so much interest,\r\nand where fixed and ancient works afford so many means of measuring\r\nits variations, the mean level of the sea is constant. There\r\nhas, therefore, never been a universal lowering, nor a universal\r\nencroachment, of the waters of the ocean. In some places, indeed,\r\nsuch as Scotland, and various parts of the Mediterranean, evidence\r\nhas been thought to have been found, that the sea has risen, and that\r\nit now covers shores which were formerly above its level[13].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volcanoes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of volcanoes is still more limited, and more local, than\r\nany of those which have yet been mentioned. Although we have no\r\nprecise idea of the means by which nature keeps up these violent\r\nfires at such great depths, we can judge decidedly, by their effects,\r\nof the changes which they may have produced at the surface of the\r\nglobe. After a volcano has announced itself, by some shocks of an\r\nearthquake, it forms for itself an opening. Stones and ashes are\r\nthrown to a great distance, and lava is vomited forth. The more fluid\r\npart of the lava flows in long streams, while the less fluid portion\r\nstops at the edges of the opening, raises its margins all round, and\r\nforms a cone, terminated by a crater. Thus volcanoes accumulate upon\r\nthe surface matters which were previously buried in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, after modifying their nature, and raise themselves into\r\nmountains. By these means, they have formerly covered some parts of\r\nour continent, and have also suddenly produced islands in the middle\r\nof the sea. But these mountains and islands have always been composed\r\nof lava, and all their materials have undergone the action of fire:\r\nthey are disposed as matters should be, which have flowed from an\r\nelevated point. Volcanoes, therefore, neither raise nor overturn the\r\nstrata through which their apertures pass; and if some causes acting\r\nfrom those depths have contributed, in certain cases, to raise up\r\nlarge mountains, they cannot have been volcanic agents of the same\r\nnature as those which exist at the present day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, we repeat, it is in vain that we search, among the powers\r\nwhich now act at the surface of the earth, for causes sufficient\r\nto produce the revolutions and catastrophes, the traces of which\r\nare exhibited by its crust: And if we have recourse to the constant\r\nexternal forces with which we are as yet acquainted, we shall have no\r\ngreater success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Constant Astronomical Causes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pole of the earth moves in a circle around the pole of the\r\necliptic, and its axis is more or less inclined to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic; but these two motions, the causes of which are now\r\nascertained, are much too limited for the production of effects like\r\nthose whose magnitude we have just been stating. At any rate, their\r\nexcessive slowness would render them altogether inadequate to account\r\nfor catastrophes which, as we have shewn, must have been sudden.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning applies to all other slow motions which have been\r\nconceived as causes of the revolutions in question, chosen doubtless\r\nin the hope that their existence could not be denied, because it\r\nmight always be easy to hold out that their very slowness rendered\r\nthem imperceptible. But whether they be true or not is of little\r\nimportance, for they explain nothing, as no cause acting slowly could\r\nhave produced sudden effects.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that there has been a gradual diminution of the waters;\r\nthat the sea has transported solid matters in all directions;\r\nthat the temperature of the globe is either diminishing or\r\nincreasing;--none of these causes could have overturned our strata;\r\nenveloped in ice large animals, with their flesh and skin; laid dry\r\nmarine testacea, the shells of which are, at the present day, as\r\nwell preserved as if they had been drawn up alive from the sea; and,\r\nlastly, destroyed numerous species, and even entire genera.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have struck most naturalists; and among those\r\nwho have endeavoured to explain the present state of the globe,\r\nhardly any one has attributed it entirely to the agency of slow\r\ncauses, still less to causes operating under our eyes. The necessity\r\nto which they are thus reduced, of seeking for causes different\r\nfrom those which we see acting at the present day, is the very\r\ncircumstance that has forced them to make so many extraordinary\r\nsuppositions, and to lose themselves in so many erroneous and\r\ncontradictory speculations, that the very name of their science, as\r\nI have elsewhere remarked, has long been a subject of ridicule to\r\nprejudiced persons, who have only looked to the systems which it\r\nhas been the means of hatching, and have forgotten the extensive\r\nand important series of authentic facts which it has brought to\r\nlight[14].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Older Systems of Geologists._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a long time, two events or epochs only, the Creation and\r\nthe Deluge, were admitted as comprehending the changes which have\r\nbeen operated upon the globe; and all the efforts of geologists\r\nwere directed to account for the present existing state of things,\r\nby imagining a certain original state, afterwards modified by the\r\ndeluge, of which also, as to its causes, its operations, and its\r\neffects, each entertained his own theory.\r\n\r\nThus, according to one[15], the earth was at first invested with\r\nan uniform light crust, which covered the abyss of the sea; and\r\nwhich being broken up for the production of the deluge, formed the\r\nmountains by its fragments. According to another[16], the deluge was\r\noccasioned by a momentary suspension of cohesion among the particles\r\nof mineral bodies; the whole mass of the globe was dissolved, and\r\nthe paste thus formed became penetrated with shells. According to a\r\nthird[17], God raised up the mountains for the purpose of allowing\r\nthe waters, which had produced the deluge, to run off; and selected\r\nthose places in which there was the greatest quantity of rocks,\r\nwithout which the mountains could not have supported themselves. A\r\nfourth[18] created the earth from the atmosphere of one comet, and\r\ndeluged it by the tail of another: The heat which it retained from\r\nits origin, was what, in his opinion, excited the whole of the living\r\nbeings upon it to sin; for which they were all drowned, excepting the\r\nfishes, whose passions were apparently less vehement.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, that, even while confined within the limits prescribed\r\nby the Book of Genesis, naturalists might still have a pretty wide\r\nrange: they soon found themselves, however, in too narrow bounds; and\r\nwhen they had succeeded in converting the six days of creation into\r\nso many indefinite periods, the lapse of ages no longer forming an\r\nobstacle to their views, their systems took a flight proportioned to\r\nthe periods which they could then dispose of at pleasure.\r\n\r\nEven the great Leibnitz amused himself, like Descartes, by conceiving\r\nthe earth to be an extinguished sun[19], a vitrified globe, upon\r\nwhich the vapours falling down again, after it had cooled, formed\r\nseas, which afterwards deposited the limestone formations.\r\n\r\nBy Demaillet the whole globe was conceived to have been covered\r\nwith water for many thousands of years. He supposed this water\r\nhad gradually retired; that all the land animals were originally\r\ninhabitants of the sea; that man himself commenced his career as a\r\nfish; and he asserts, that it is not uncommon, even now, to meet with\r\nfishes in the ocean, which are still only half converted into men,\r\nbut whose descendants will in time become perfect human beings[20].\r\n\r\nThe system of Buffon is merely an extension of that of Leibnitz, with\r\nthe addition only of a comet, which, by a violent blow, struck off\r\nfrom the sun the liquefied mass of the earth, together with those of\r\nall the other planets at the same instant. From this supposition,\r\nhe was enabled to assume positive dates, as, from the present\r\ntemperature of the earth, it could be calculated how long it had\r\ntaken to cool down so far; and, as all the other planets had come\r\nfrom the sun at the same time, it could also be calculated how many\r\nages are still required for cooling the greater ones, and to what\r\ndegree the smaller are already frozen[21].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_More recent Systems._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our own times, men of still bolder imaginations have exercised\r\ntheir minds upon this great subject. Some writers have revived\r\nand greatly extended the ideas of Demaillet. They suppose that\r\nevery thing was originally fluid; that this fluid gave existence\r\nto animals, which were at first of the most simple kind, such as\r\nthe monads and other infusory and microscopic species; that, in\r\nprocess of time, and by assuming different habits, the races of\r\nanimals became complicated, and assumed that diversity of nature\r\nand character in which they now appear. By means of those various\r\nraces of animals, part of the waters of the sea have gradually been\r\nconverted into calcareous earth; while the vegetables, concerning the\r\norigin and metamorphoses of which these writers are totally silent,\r\nhave, on their part, converted a portion of the same water into clay:\r\nThese two earths, on being stripped of the characters which life had\r\nimpressed upon them, are resolved, by a final analysis, into silex;\r\nand hence the reason that the oldest mountains are more siliceous\r\nthan the rest. All the solid parts of the earth, therefore, owe\r\ntheir existence to life, and, without life, the globe would still be\r\nentirely liquid[22].\r\n\r\nOther writers have preferred the ideas of Kepler, and, like that\r\ngreat astronomer, have considered the globe itself as possessed of\r\nvital faculties. According to them a vital fluid circulates in it;\r\na process of assimilation goes on in it, as well as in animated\r\nbodies; every particle of it is alive; it possesses instinct and\r\nvolition, even to the most elementary molecules, which attract and\r\nrepel each other according to sympathies and antipathies. Each kind\r\nof mineral has the power of converting immense masses into its own\r\nnature, as we convert our food into flesh and blood. The mountains\r\nare the respiratory organs of the globe, and the schists its organs\r\nof secretion; it is by these latter that it decomposes the water of\r\nthe sea, in order to produce the matters ejected by volcanoes. The\r\nveins are carious sores, abscesses of the mineral kingdom; and the\r\nmetals are products of rottenness and disease, which is the reason\r\nthat almost all of them have so bad a smell[23].\r\n\r\nMore recently still, a philosophy, which substitutes metaphor for\r\nreasoning, and proceeds on the system of absolute identity or of\r\npantheism, attributes the production of all phenomena, or which,\r\nin the eyes of its supporters, is the same thing, all beings, to\r\npolarization, such as is manifested by the two electricities; and\r\ndenominating every kind of opposition or difference, whether of\r\nsituation, of nature, or of function, by the title of Polarisation,\r\nopposes to each other, in the first place, God and the universe;\r\nthen, in the universe, the sun and the planets; next, in each planet,\r\nthe solid and the liquid; and, pursuing this course, changing its\r\nfigures and allegories according to its necessities, at length\r\narrives at the last details of organic species[24].\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be observed, that these are what may be termed\r\nextreme examples, and that all geologists have not carried the\r\nextravagance of their conceptions to such a length as those which\r\nwe have just cited. Yet, among those who have proceeded with\r\nmore caution, and have not searched for geological causes beyond\r\nthe limits of physical and chemical science, much diversity and\r\ncontradiction still prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diversities of all the Systems._\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to one system, every thing has been successively\r\nprecipitated by crystallization, and deposited nearly as it exists at\r\npresent; but the sea, which covered all, has gradually retired[25].\r\n\r\nAccording to another, the materials of which the mountains consist,\r\nare incessantly worn down and carried off by the rivers to be\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the sea, where they are heated under an\r\nenormous pressure, and form strata, which are one day to be violently\r\nlifted up by the heat which consolidates them[26].\r\n\r\nA third supposes the fluid divided into a multitude of lakes, placed,\r\nlike the seats of an amphitheatre, above each other, which, after\r\nhaving deposited our shelly strata, have successively broken their\r\ndikes, to descend and fill the basin of the ocean[27].\r\n\r\nAccording to a fourth, tides of seven or eight hundred fathoms depth\r\nhave carried off, from time to time, the matter lying at the bottom\r\nof the sea, and have thrown it, in the form of mountains and hills,\r\nupon the original valleys or plains of the continent[28].\r\n\r\nA fifth makes the various fragments of which the earth is composed,\r\nfall successively from heaven, in the manner of meteoric stones,\r\nbearing the impress of their foreign origin in the unknown beings\r\nwhose remains they contain[29].\r\n\r\nA sixth represents the globe as hollow, and places within it a\r\nloadstone nucleus, which is transported from one pole to the other,\r\nby the attraction of comets, carrying along with it the centre of\r\ngravity, and the mass of waters at the surface; thus alternately\r\ndrowning the two hemispheres[30].\r\n\r\nWe might mention twenty other systems, as different from one another\r\nas those enumerated. And to prevent mistake, we may here state, that\r\nour intention is not captiously to criticize or find fault with their\r\nauthors; on the contrary, we admit that these ideas have generally\r\nbeen conceived by men of intellect and knowledge, who were not\r\nignorant of facts, several of whom had even travelled extensively for\r\nthe purpose of examining them, and who, in this manner, made numerous\r\nand important additions to science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of these differences._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence comes it, then, that there should be so much contrariety\r\nin the solutions of the same problem, that are given by men who\r\nproceed upon the same principles? May not this have been occasioned\r\nby the conditions of the problem never having been all taken\r\ninto consideration at once; by which it has remained hitherto\r\nindeterminate, and susceptible of many solutions,--all equally good,\r\nwhen such or such conditions are abstracted; and all equally bad,\r\nwhen a new condition comes to be known, or when the attention is\r\ndirected to some condition which had been formerly neglected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature and Conditions of the Problem._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo quit the language of mathematics, it may be asserted, that almost\r\nall the authors of these systems, confining their attention to\r\ncertain difficulties which struck them more forcibly than others,\r\nhave endeavoured to solve these in a manner more or less plausible,\r\nand have left unnoticed others, equally numerous, and equally\r\nimportant. For example, the only difficulty with one consisted in\r\nexplaining the changes that had taken place in the level of the\r\nsea; with another, it consisted in accounting for the solution of\r\nall terrestrial substances in one and the same menstruum; and with\r\na third, in shewing how animals that were believed to be natives of\r\nthe torrid zone could live in the frigid zone. Exhausting all the\r\npowers of the mind upon these questions, they conceived that they\r\nhad done every thing that was necessary when they had contrived some\r\nmethod of answering them; and yet, while they neglected all the other\r\nphenomena, they did not always think of determining with precision\r\nthe measure and limits of those which they had endeavoured to explain.\r\n\r\nThis is peculiarly the case with regard to the secondary formations,\r\nwhich constitute, however, the most important and most difficult part\r\nof the problem. During a long time, all that was done with respect\r\nto these, consisted of feeble attempts to determine the order of\r\nsuperposition of their strata, and the connections of these strata\r\nwith the species of animals and plants whose remains they contain.\r\n\r\nAre there certain animals and plants peculiar to certain strata, and\r\nnot found in others? What are the species that appear first in order,\r\nand what those which succeed? Do these two kinds of species sometimes\r\naccompany each other? Are there alternations in their appearance;\r\nor, in other words, do the first reappear a second time, and do the\r\nothers then disappear? Have these animals and plants all lived in the\r\nplaces where their remains are found, or have they been transported\r\nthither from other places? Do they all live at the present day in\r\nsome part of the earth, or have they been partially or totally\r\ndestroyed? Is there any constant connection between the antiquity of\r\nthe strata and the resemblance, or non-resemblance, of the fossils\r\ncontained in them to the animals and plants which now exist? Is there\r\nany connexion, in regard to climate, between the fossils and such\r\nliving beings as resemble them most? May it be concluded, that the\r\ntransportation of these living beings, if such a thing ever happened,\r\nhas taken place from north to south, or from east to west; or were\r\nthey irregularly scattered and mingled together; and can the epochs\r\nof these transportations be determined by the characters which they\r\nhave impressed upon the strata?\r\n\r\nWhat can be said regarding the causes of the existing state of the\r\nglobe, if no reply can be made to these questions,--if there be no\r\nsufficient grounds to determine the choice between answering in the\r\naffirmative or negative? It is but too true, that, for a long time,\r\nnone of these points was satisfactorily determined; and scarcely\r\neven would geologists seem to have had any idea of the propriety of\r\nclearing them up before constructing their systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reason for which the Conditions of the Problem have been neglected._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason of this strange procedure will be discovered, when\r\nwe reflect, that all geologists have hitherto been, either mere\r\ncabinet naturalists, who had themselves paid little attention to the\r\nstructure of mountains, or mere mineralogists, who had not studied\r\nin sufficient detail the innumerable varieties of animals, and the\r\ninfinite complication of their various parts. The former of these\r\nhave only constructed systems: the latter have furnished excellent\r\nobservations, and have laid the foundation of true geological\r\nscience; but have been unable to complete the edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Progress of Mineral Geology._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purely mineral part of the great problem of the Theory of the\r\nEarth has been investigated with admirable care by Saussure, and has\r\nbeen since carried to an astonishing degree of development by Werner,\r\nand by the numerous enlightened pupils of his school.\r\n\r\nThe former of these celebrated men, by a laborious investigation\r\nof the most inaccessible districts, continued for twenty years, in\r\nwhich he examined the Alps on all sides, and penetrated through\r\nall their defiles; has laid open to our view the entire disorder\r\nof the primitive formations, and has distinctly traced the limits\r\nby which they are distinguished from the secondary formations. The\r\nother, taking advantage of the numerous excavations made in the most\r\nancient mining district in the world, has fixed the laws by which the\r\nsuccession of the strata are regulated, pointing out the relative\r\nantiquity of these strata, and tracing each of them through all its\r\nmetamorphoses. It is from him, and from him alone, that we date the\r\ncommencement of real geology, in so far as concerns the mineral\r\nnature of the strata: but neither he nor Saussure have determined the\r\nfossil organic species occurring in each kind of stratum, with the\r\naccuracy which has become necessary, now that the number of animals\r\nalready known is so great.\r\n\r\nOther naturalists, it is true, have examined the the fossil remains\r\nof organised bodies; they have collected and figured them by\r\nthousands, and their works will serve as so many precious collections\r\nof materials. But, considering these animals and plants more with\r\nreference to their own nature, than as connected with the theory of\r\nthe earth; or regarding these petrifactions as curiosities, rather\r\nthan as historical documents; or, lastly, contenting themselves with\r\npractical explanations regarding the position of each fragment,\r\nthey have almost always neglected to investigate the general laws\r\naffecting the geological position of organic remains, or their\r\nconnection with the strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of Fossil Remains in Geology._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the idea of such an investigation was very natural; for\r\nit is abundantly obvious, that it is to these fossil remains alone\r\nthat we owe even the commencement of a theory of the earth, and\r\nthat, without them, we should perhaps never have even suspected that\r\nthere had existed any successive epochs, and a series of different\r\noperations, in the formation of the globe. By them alone we are,\r\nin fact, enabled to ascertain, that the globe has not always had\r\nthe same external crust; because, we are thoroughly assured, that\r\nthe plants and animals must have lived at the surface before they\r\nhad thus come to be buried deep beneath it. It is only by analogy\r\nthat we have been enabled to extend to the primitive formations,\r\nthe conclusion which is furnished directly for the secondary by the\r\norganic remains which they contain; and if there had only existed\r\nformations in which no fossil remains were inclosed, it could\r\nnever have been shewn that these formations had not all been of\r\nsimultaneous origin.\r\n\r\nIt is also by means of the organic remains, slight as is the\r\nknowledge we have hitherto acquired of them, that we have been\r\nenabled to discover the little that we yet know respecting the nature\r\nof the revolutions of the globe. From them we have learned, that\r\nthe strata in which they are buried have been quietly deposited in\r\na fluid; that their variations have corresponded with those of the\r\nfluid in question; that their being laid bare has been occasioned by\r\nthe transportation of this fluid to some other place; and that this\r\ncircumstance must have befallen them more than once. Nothing of all\r\nthis could have been known with certainty, had no fossil remains\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThe study of the mineral part of geology, though not less necessary,\r\nand even of much more utility to the practical arts, is yet much less\r\ninstructive with reference to the object of our present inquiry.\r\n\r\nWe remain in utter ignorance respecting the causes which have given\r\nrise to the variety in the mineral substances of which the strata are\r\ncomposed. We are even ignorant of the agents which may have held some\r\nof these substances in solution; and it is still disputed, respecting\r\nseveral of them, whether they have owed their origin to water or to\r\nfire. After all, philosophers are only agreed on one point, which is,\r\nthat the sea has changed its place; and how should this have been\r\nknown, unless by means of the fossil remains?\r\n\r\nThe organic remains, therefore, which have given rise to the\r\ntheory of the earth, have, at the same time, furnished it with its\r\nprincipal illustrations;--the only ones, indeed, that have as yet\r\nbeen generally acknowledged.\r\n\r\nIt is this consideration which has encouraged us to investigate the\r\nsubject. But the field is vast; and it is but a very small portion\r\nof it that could be cultivated by the labour of a single individual.\r\nIt was necessary, therefore, to select a particular department; and\r\nthe choice was soon made. The class of fossil remains which forms\r\nthe subject of this work, engaged our attention at the very outset,\r\nbecause it appeared to us to be that which is the most fertile in\r\nprecise results, and yet, at the same time, less known, and richer in\r\nnew objects of research[31].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_High importance of the Fossil Bones of Quadrupeds._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, in fact, that the fossil bones of quadrupeds must lead\r\nto more accurate conclusions than any other remains of organized\r\nbodies, and that for several reasons.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they indicate much more clearly the nature of\r\nthe revolutions to which they have already been subjected. Shells\r\ncertainly announce the fact, that the sea has once existed in the\r\nplaces where they have been formed; but the changes which have taken\r\nplace in their species, when rigorously inquired into, may have\r\narisen from slight changes in the nature of the fluid in which they\r\nlived, or merely in its temperature. They may even have been produced\r\nby causes still more accidental. We can never be perfectly assured\r\nthat certain species, and even genera, inhabiting the bottom of the\r\nsea, and occupying certain fixed spaces, for a longer or shorter\r\ntime, may not have been driven away and supplanted by other species\r\nor genera.\r\n\r\nIn regard to quadrupeds, on the contrary, every thing is precise. The\r\nappearance of their bones in strata, and still more of their entire\r\ncarcases, announces, either that the stratum itself which contains\r\nthem has, at a former period, been laid dry, or, at least, that dry\r\nland must have existed in its neighbourhood. Their disappearance\r\nrenders it certain, that this stratum has been inundated, or that the\r\ndry land in question has ceased to exist. It is from them, therefore,\r\nthat we learn with perfect certainty the important fact of repeated\r\nirruptions of the sea, which the shells and other marine productions\r\ncould not of themselves have proved; and it is by a careful\r\ninvestigation of them, that we may hope to ascertain the number and\r\nthe epochs of these irruptions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, The nature of the revolutions which have altered the\r\nsurface of the globe, must have exerted a more powerful action\r\nupon terrestrial quadrupeds, than upon marine animals. As these\r\nrevolutions have consisted chiefly of changes in the bed of the\r\nsea, and as the waters must have destroyed all the quadrupeds which\r\nthey reached, if their irruption was general, it would necessarily\r\nhave destroyed the entire class; or if it only overwhelmed certain\r\ncontinents at one time, it would at least have destroyed the species\r\npeculiar to those continents, without having the same effect upon the\r\nmarine animals. On the other hand, millions of aquatic animals would\r\nhave been left dry, or buried under newly-formed strata, or thrown\r\nviolently on the coasts; while their races would still have been\r\npreserved in some more peaceful parts of the sea, whence they might\r\nagain be propagated after the agitation of the waters had ceased.\r\n\r\nThirdly, This more complete action is also more easily ascertained.\r\nIt is more easy to demonstrate its effects, because, the number of\r\nquadrupeds being limited, and the greater part of their species, at\r\nleast the large ones, being known, we have more means of determining\r\nwhether fossil bones belong to them, or to a species that is now\r\nlost. As, on the other hand, we are very far from being acquainted\r\nwith all the testaceous animals and fishes which inhabit the sea,\r\nand as we are still probably ignorant of the greater number of those\r\nwhich live in deep water, it is impossible to know with certainty,\r\nwhether a species which occurs in a fossil state, may not still exist\r\nsomewhere alive. And hence, we see naturalists persisting in giving\r\nthe name of pelagic shells, that is to say, shells inhabiting the\r\nopen sea, to the belemnites, cornua-ammonis, and other testaceous\r\nremains, which have hitherto been found only in the older strata;\r\nmeaning by this, that if they have not yet been discovered in a\r\nliving state, it is because they inhabit the depths of the sea, far\r\nbeyond the reach of our nets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Small probability of discovering New Species of large Quadrupeds._\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturalists, certainly, have not yet explored all the continents, nor\r\ndo they even know all the quadrupeds which inhabit the countries that\r\nthey have explored. New species of this class are discovered from\r\ntime to time; and those who have not examined with attention all the\r\ncircumstances belonging to these discoveries, might also imagine that\r\nthe unknown quadrupeds, whose bones are found in our strata, may\r\nremain to this day concealed, in some islands not yet discovered by\r\nnavigators, or in some of the vast deserts which occupy the middle of\r\nAsia, Africa, the two Americas, and New Holland.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we carefully examine what kinds of quadrupeds have been\r\nrecently discovered, and in what circumstances they have been found,\r\nwe shall see that there is little hope of our ever finding alive\r\nthose which have hitherto been observed only in a fossil state.\r\n\r\nIslands of moderate extent, and at a considerable distance from\r\nthe continents or large islands, possess very few quadrupeds, and\r\nthese, for the greater part, of diminutive size. When they happen\r\nto contain any of the larger species, these must have been carried\r\nto them from other countries. Bougainville and Cook found no other\r\nlarge quadrupeds than hogs and dogs in the South Sea Islands; and the\r\nlargest species of the West India Islands was the _agouti_.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the great continents, such as Asia, Africa, the two\r\nAmericas, and New Holland, possess large quadrupeds, and, generally\r\nspeaking, contain species peculiar to each; insomuch, that whenever\r\nlarge countries of this description have been discovered, which\r\ntheir situation has kept isolated from the rest of the world, the\r\nclass of quadrupeds which they contained has been found entirely\r\ndifferent from any that existed elsewhere. Thus, when the Spaniards\r\nfirst penetrated into South America, they did not find a single\r\nspecies of quadruped the same as any of Europe, Asia, or Africa.\r\nThe puma, the jaguar, the tapir, the cabiai, the llama, the vicuna,\r\nthe sloths, the armadilloes, the opossums, and the whole tribe of\r\nsapajous, were to them entirely new animals, of which they had no\r\nidea. Similar circumstances have recurred in our own time, when\r\nthe coasts of New Holland and the adjacent islands were first\r\nexplored. The various species of kangaroo, phascolomys, dasyurus, and\r\nperameles, the flying phalangers, the ornithorynchi and echidnæ, have\r\nastonished naturalists by the strangeness of their conformations,\r\nwhich presented proportions contrary to all former rules, and were\r\nincapable of being arranged under any of the systems then in use.\r\n\r\nIf there yet remained some great continent to be discovered, we might\r\nstill hope to become acquainted with new species, among which there\r\nmight be found some having more or less similarity to those of which\r\nwe have discovered the remains in the bowels of the earth. But it is\r\nsufficient to cast a glance over the map of the world, and see the\r\ninnumerable directions in which navigators have traversed the ocean,\r\nin order to be satisfied that there remains no other large land to\r\nbe discovered, unless it may be situated towards the South Pole,\r\nwhere the existence of life would necessarily be precluded by the\r\naccumulation of ice.\r\n\r\nHence, it is only from the interior of the large divisions of the\r\nworld, that we can have any hope of still procuring quadrupeds\r\nhitherto unknown. But a little reflection will be sufficient to\r\nconvince us, that our expectations from this source have as little\r\nfoundation as from that of the islands.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, the European traveller cannot easily traverse vast extents\r\nof countries, which are either destitute of inhabitants, or are\r\npeopled only with ferocious tribes; and this is more especially true\r\nwith regard to Africa. But there is nothing to prevent the animals\r\nthemselves from roaming over these countries in all directions, and\r\npenetrating to the coasts. Even when there may be great chains of\r\nmountains between the coasts and the deserts of the interior, they\r\nmust always be broken in some places to allow the rivers to pass\r\nthrough; and, in these burning deserts, the quadrupeds naturally\r\nfollow the banks of rivers. The inhabitants of the coasts also ascend\r\nthese rivers, and soon become acquainted with all the remarkable\r\nspecies which exist even to their sources, either from personal\r\nobservation, or by means of intercourse with the inhabitants of\r\nthe interior. At no period, therefore, could civilized nations have\r\nfrequented the coast of a large country for any considerable length\r\nof time, without gaining some tolerable knowledge of such of the\r\nanimals which it contained as were remarkable for their size or\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is confirmed by well known facts. Although the\r\nancients never passed the mountains of Imaus, or crossed the Ganges,\r\nin Asia; and, although they never penetrated very far beyond Mount\r\nAtlas, in Africa; yet were they, in reality, acquainted with all the\r\nlarge animals of these two divisions of the world; and, if they have\r\nnot distinguished all the species, it was not because they had not\r\nseen them, or heard them spoken of by others, but because the mutual\r\nresemblances of some of these species caused them to be confounded\r\ntogether. The only important exception which can be opposed to this\r\nassertion, presents itself in the Tapir of Malacca, recently sent\r\nhome from India by two young naturalists, pupils of mine, Messrs\r\nDuvaucel and Diard, and which in fact is one of the most interesting\r\ndiscoveries with which Natural History has been enriched in these\r\nlatter times.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were perfectly acquainted with the Elephant; and the\r\nhistory of that quadruped is given more accurately by Aristotle than\r\nby Buffon. They were not even ignorant of some of the differences\r\nwhich distinguish the elephants of Africa from those of Asia[32].\r\n\r\nThey knew the two-horned Rhinoceros, which has never been seen alive\r\nin modern Europe. Domitian exhibited it at Rome, and had it stamped\r\non his medals, which have been very well described by Pausanias.\r\n\r\nThe one-horned Rhinoceros, distant as was its country, was equally\r\nknown to them. Pompey shewed one at Rome; and Strabo has accurately\r\ndescribed another which he saw at Alexandria[33].\r\n\r\nThe Rhinoceros of Sumatra described by Mr Bell; and that of Java,\r\ndiscovered and sent home by Messrs Duvaucel and Diard, do not appear\r\nto inhabit the continent. Hence, it is not surprising, that the\r\nancients should have been ignorant of them; besides, they probably\r\nwould not have distinguished them from the others.\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus has not been so well described as the preceding\r\nanimals; yet very exact representations of it have been left by the\r\nRomans in their monuments relative to Egypt, such as the statue of\r\nthe Nile, the Palestrine pavement, and a great number of medals.\r\nIn fact, this animal was repeatedly seen by the Romans; having been\r\nexhibited by Scaurus, Augustus, Antoninus, Commodus, Heliogabalus,\r\nPhilip, and Carinus[34].\r\n\r\nThe two species of Camel, the Bactrian and Arabian, are both very\r\nwell described and characterized by Aristotle[35].\r\n\r\nThe Giraffe, or Camelopard (Camel-Leopard), was also well known to\r\nthe ancients. A live one was shewn at Rome, in the circus, during\r\nthe dictatorship of Julius Cæsar, in the year of Rome 708; and ten\r\nof them were exhibited together by Gordian III. all of which were\r\nkilled at the secular games of Philip[36], a circumstance which\r\nmay well surprise the moderns, who have only witnessed a single\r\nindividual, which was sent by the Soldan of Egypt to Laurentius de\r\nMedicis, in the fifteenth century, and is painted in the frescoes of\r\nPoggio-Cajano.\r\n\r\nIf we read with attention the descriptions of the Hippopotamus,\r\ngiven by Herodotus and Aristotle, and which are supposed to have\r\nbeen borrowed from Hecatæus of Miletum, we shall find, that they\r\nmust have been made up from two different animals, one of which\r\nwas perhaps the true hippopotamus, and the other was assuredly the\r\nGnou[37], a quadruped, of which our naturalists begin to take notice\r\nonly about the end of the eighteenth century. It is the same animal\r\nof which fabulous accounts were given by Pliny and Ælian, under the\r\nname of _catoblepas_ and _catablepon_[38].\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian Boar of Agatharchides, which is described as having\r\nhorns, is precisely the Ethiopian Boar of modern times, the enormous\r\ntusks of which deserve the name of horns nearly as much as those of\r\nthe elephant[39].\r\n\r\nThe Bubalus and Nagor are described by Pliny[40]; the Gazelle by\r\nÆlian[41]; the Oryx by Oppian[42]; the Axis, so early as the time of\r\nCtesias[43]; and the Algazel, and Corinne, are accurately figured\r\nupon the Egyptian monuments[44].\r\n\r\nÆlian has well described the _Bos grunniens_ or Yak, under the name\r\nof the ox having a tail which serves for a fly-flapper[45].\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo was not domesticated by the ancients; but the Indian Ox,\r\nof which Ælian speaks[46], and which had horns large enough to hold\r\nthree amphoræ, was assuredly that variety of the buffalo which is\r\nnow called the _arnee_. And even the wild ox with depressed horns,\r\nwhich is mentioned by Aristotle as inhabiting Arachosia, a province\r\nof ancient Persia, could be nothing else than the common buffalo[47].\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with the hornless variety of the ox[48],\r\nand with the African oxen, whose horns, being only attached to the\r\nskin, moved with it[49]. They also knew the Indian oxen, which\r\nequalled the horse in speed[50]; and those which were so small as\r\nnot to exceed a he-goat in size[51]. Nor were the broad-tailed sheep\r\nunknown to them[52],--nor those of India, which were said to be as\r\nlarge as asses[53].\r\n\r\nAlthough the accounts left us by the ancients, respecting the\r\nAurochs, the Rein-deer, and Elk, are all mingled with fable, they\r\nare yet sufficient to prove that these animals were in some degree\r\nknown to them, but that the reports which had reached them, had been\r\ncommunicated by ignorant people, and had not been corrected by a\r\njudicious examination[54]. These animals still inhabit the countries\r\nwhich the ancients assigned to them; and have only disappeared in\r\nsuch of them as have been too much cultivated for their habits. The\r\naurochs[55] and elk still exist in the forests of Lithuania, which\r\nwere formerly continuous with the great Hercynian Forest. The former\r\nof these animals still occurs in the northern parts of Greece, as\r\nit did in the days of Pausanias. The rein-deer inhabits the snowy\r\nregions of the north, where it always had its abode; it changes\r\nits colour, not at pleasure, but according to the change of the\r\nseasons. It was in consequence of mistakes scarcely excusable, that\r\nit was imagined to have occurred in the Pyrenees in the fourteenth\r\ncentury[56].\r\n\r\nEven the White Bear had been seen in Egypt while under the\r\nPtolemies[57].\r\n\r\nLions and Panthers were common at Rome, where they were presented\r\nby hundreds in the games of the Circus. Even several Tigers were\r\nexhibited there, as well as the Striped Hyena and the Crocodile\r\nof the Nile. In the ancient mosaics preserved at Rome, there are\r\nexcellent representations of the rarest of these animals. Among\r\nothers, the striped hyena is seen represented with accuracy in a\r\nfragment preserved in the Museum of the Vatican; and, while I was\r\nat Rome in 1809, a mosaic pavement, composed of natural stones,\r\narranged in the Florentine manner, was discovered in a garden beside\r\nthe triumphal arch of Galienus, which represented four Bengal tigers\r\nexecuted in a superior manner.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Vatican, there is deposited the figure of a\r\ncrocodile in basalt, which is almost a perfect representation of that\r\nanimal[58].\r\n\r\nIt cannot in the least be doubted, that the _Hippotigris_ was the\r\nZebra, which, however, is only found in the southern parts of\r\nAfrica[59].\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to shew that almost all the more remarkable\r\nspecies of Apes and Monkeys have been distinctly indicated by the\r\nancients, under the names of _Pitheci_, _Sphinxes_, _Satyri_, _Cebi_,\r\n_Cynocephali_, and _Cercopitheci_[60].\r\n\r\nThey even knew, and have described several species of Glires\r\nof inconsiderable size, when these animals presented any thing\r\nremarkable in their conformation or properties[61]. But the small\r\nspecies are of no importance with reference to the object in view;\r\nand, it is sufficient for our purpose to have shewn, that all the\r\nlarge species, which possess any remarkable character, and which we\r\nknow to inhabit Europe, Asia, and Africa, at the present day, were\r\nknown to the ancients; whence we may fairly conclude, that their\r\nsilence in respect to the small quadrupeds, and their neglect in\r\ndistinguishing the species which very nearly resemble each other,\r\nas the various species of antelopes, and of some other genera,\r\nwere occasioned by want of attention and ignorance of methodical\r\narrangement, rather than by any difficulty proceeding from climate.\r\nWe may also conclude, with equal certainty, that, as the lapse\r\nof eighteen or twenty centuries, together with the advantages\r\nof circumnavigating Africa, and of penetrating into India, have\r\nadded nothing in this department to the information left us by the\r\nancients, there is no probability that succeeding ages will add much\r\nto the knowledge of our posterity.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps some persons may be disposed to employ an opposite\r\ntrain of argument, and to allege that the ancients were not only\r\nacquainted with as many large quadrupeds as we are, as has already\r\nbeen shewn, but that they have described several others which we do\r\nnot now know,--that we act rashly in considering these animals as\r\nfabulous,--that we ought to search for them before concluding that we\r\nhave exhausted the history of the present animal creation,--and, in\r\nfine, that among those animals which we presume to be fabulous, we\r\nmay, perhaps, discover, when we become better acquainted with them,\r\nthe originals of those bones of unknown animals which we discover\r\nburied in the earth. Some may even conceive, that those various\r\nmonsters, which constitute the essential ornaments of the history of\r\nthe heroic ages of almost all countries, are precisely those very\r\nspecies which it was necessary to destroy, in order to allow the\r\nestablishment of civilization. Thus the Theseuses and Bellerophons\r\nof ancient times had been more fortunate than all the nations of our\r\ndays, which have only been able to drive back the noxious animals,\r\nbut have never yet succeeded in exterminating a single species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inquiry respecting the Fabulous Animals of the Ancients._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to reply to the foregoing objection, by examining\r\nthe descriptions of these unknown beings, and by inquiring into\r\ntheir origins. The greater number of them have an origin purely\r\nmythological, and of this origin their descriptions bear unequivocal\r\nmarks; for in almost all of them we see merely parts of known animals\r\nunited by an unbridled imagination, and in contradiction to all the\r\nlaws of nature.\r\n\r\nThose which were invented or arranged by the Greeks, have at least\r\nthe merit of possessing elegance in their composition. Like those\r\narabesques which decorate the remains of some ancient buildings,\r\nand which have been multiplied by the fertile pencil of Raphael, the\r\nforms which they combine, however repugnant to reason they may be,\r\npresent agreeable contours. They are the fantastic productions of\r\nplayful genius; perhaps emblematic representations in the oriental\r\ntaste, in which were supposed to be concealed under mystical images\r\ncertain propositions in metaphysics or in morals. We may excuse those\r\nwho employ their time in attempts to discover the wisdom concealed in\r\nthe sphinx of Thebes, the pegasus of Thessaly, the minotaur of Crete,\r\nor the chimera of Epirus; but it would be absurd to expect seriously\r\nto find such productions in nature. As well might we search for the\r\nanimals described in the Book of Daniel, or for the beast of the\r\nApocalypse.\r\n\r\nNeither may we look for the mythological animals of the Persians,\r\ncreatures of a still bolder imagination: the _martichore_, or\r\nman-destroyer, bearing a human head on the body of a lion, terminated\r\nby the tail of a scorpion[62]; the _griffon_, guardian of treasures,\r\nhalf eagle, half lion[63]; the _cartazonon_, or wild ass, armed with\r\na long horn on its forehead[64].\r\n\r\nCtesias, who has described these as real animals, has been looked\r\nupon by many authors as an inventor of fables; whereas he has merely\r\nattributed an actual existence to emblematical figures. These\r\nimaginary compositions have been seen in modern times sculptured upon\r\nthe ruins of Persepolis[65]. What they were intended to signify we\r\nshall probably never know; but of this much we are certain, that they\r\ndo not represent actual beings.\r\n\r\nAgatharchidas, another fabricator of animals, drew his information in\r\nall probability from a similar source. The ancient Egyptian monuments\r\nstill furnish us with numerous fantastic representations, in which\r\nthe parts of different species are combined: gods are often figured\r\nwith a human body and the head of an animal, and animals are seen\r\nwith human heads; thus giving rise to the cynocephali, sphinxes, and\r\nsatyrs of ancient naturalists. The custom of representing in the same\r\npainting men of very different sizes, of making the king or the\r\nconqueror gigantic, the subjects or the conquered three or four times\r\nsmaller, must have given rise to the fable of the pigmies. It was in\r\nsome corner of one of these monuments that Agatharchidas must have\r\nseen his carnivorous bull, which, with mouth extending from ear to\r\near, devoured every other animal[66]. Certainly no naturalist would\r\nadmit the existence of such an animal; for nature never combines\r\neither cloven hoofs or horns with teeth adapted for devouring animal\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThere may perhaps have been many other figures equally strange,\r\neither among such of these monuments as have not been able to resist\r\nthe ravages of time, or in the temples of Ethiopia and Arabia, which\r\nhave been destroyed by the religious zeal of the Mahometans and\r\nAbyssinians. The monuments of India teem with such figures; but the\r\ncombinations in these are too extravagant to have deceived any one.\r\nMonsters with a hundred arms, and twenty heads all different from\r\none another, are far too absurd to be believed. Nay, the inhabitants\r\nof Japan and China also have their imaginary animals, which they\r\nrepresent as real, and which figure even in their religious books.\r\nThe Mexicans had them. In short, they are the fashion among all\r\nnations, whether at the periods when their idolatry has not yet\r\nbeen refined, or when the import of these emblematical combinations\r\nhas been lost. But who would dare to affirm that he had found those\r\nproductions of ignorance and superstition in nature? And yet it may\r\nhave happened that travellers, influenced by a desire of making\r\nthemselves famous, might pretend that they had seen those strange\r\nbeings, or that, deceived by a slight resemblance, into which they\r\nwere too careless to enquire, they may have taken real animals for\r\nthem. In the eyes of such people, large baboons or monkeys may have\r\nappeared true cynocephali, sphinxes, or men with tails. It is thus\r\nthat St Augustin may have imagined he had seen a satyr.\r\n\r\nSome real animals, inaccurately observed and described, may have\r\ngiven rise to monstrous ideas, which, however, have had their\r\nfoundation in some reality. Thus, we can have no doubt of the\r\nexistence of the hyena, although that animal has not its neck\r\nsupported by a single bone[67], and although it does not change its\r\nsex every year, as Pliny alleges[68]. Thus, also, the carnivorous\r\nbull is perhaps nothing else than a two-horned rhinoceros erroneously\r\ndescribed. M. de Weltheim affirms with probability, that the\r\nauriferous ants of Herodotus are _corsacs_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous amongst these fabulous animals of the\r\nancients, is the _unicorn_. Even to our own time people have\r\nobstinately persisted in searching for it, or, at least, in seeking\r\narguments to prove its existence. Three separate animals are\r\nfrequently mentioned by the ancients as having only one horn in the\r\nmiddle of the forehead. The _African oryx_, having cloven hoofs, the\r\nhair placed in the contrary direction to that of other animals[69],\r\nequal in size to the bull[70] or even the rhinoceros[71], and said\r\nto resemble deer and goats in form[72]; the _Indian ass_, having\r\nsolid hoofs; and the _monoceros_, properly so called, whose feet\r\nare sometimes compared to those of the lion[73], and sometimes to\r\nthose of the elephant[74], and which is therefore considered as\r\nhaving divided feet. The one-horned horse[75] and one-horned bull are\r\ndoubtless both to be referred to the Indian ass, for even the latter\r\nis described as having solid hoofs[76]. I would ask, If these animals\r\nexist as distinct species, should we not at least have their horns in\r\nour collections? And what single horns do we possess, excepting those\r\nof the rhinoceros and narwal?\r\n\r\nHow is it possible, after this, to refer to rude figures traced by\r\nsavages upon rocks[77]? Ignorant of perspective, and wishing to\r\nrepresent a straight horned antelope in profile, they could only give\r\nit a single horn, and thus they produced an oryx. The oryxes, too,\r\nthat are seen on the Egyptian monuments, are probably nothing more\r\nthan productions of the stiff style, imposed upon the artists of\r\nthat country by their religion. Many of their profiles of quadrupeds\r\nshew only one fore and one hind leg; and this being the case, why\r\nshould they have shewn two horns? It may perhaps have chanced that\r\nindividuals have been taken in the chace, which had accidentally\r\nlost one of their horns, as pretty frequently happens to the chamois\r\nand saiga: and this would have been sufficient to confirm the error\r\nproduced by these representations. It is probably in this way that\r\nthe unicorn has recently been reported to be found in the mountains\r\nof Thibet.\r\n\r\nAll the ancients, however, have not represented the oryx as having\r\nonly one horn. Oppian expressly gives it several[78], and Ælian\r\nmentions oryxes which had four[79]. Finally, if this animal was\r\nruminant and cloven-hoofed, we know assuredly that its frontal bone\r\nmust have been longitudinally divided into two, and that it could\r\nnot, as is very justly remarked by Camper, have had a horn placed\r\nupon the suture.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, What two-horned animal could have given the\r\nidea of the oryx, and presented the characters which it is described\r\nas possessing with regard to its conformation, even independent of\r\nthe notion of a single horn? To this I reply, with Pallas, that it\r\nwas the straight horned antelope, the _Antilope oryx_ of Gmelin,\r\nimproperly named _pasan_ by Buffon. It inhabits the deserts of\r\nAfrica, and must approach the confines of Egypt. It is this animal\r\nwhich the hieroglyphics appear to represent. Its form is nearly\r\nthat of the stag; its size equals that of the bull; the hair of\r\nits back is directed toward the head; its horns form exceedingly\r\nformidable weapons, pointed like javelins, and hard as iron; its hair\r\nis whitish, and its face is marked with spots and streaks of black.\r\nSuch is the description given of it by naturalists; and the fables\r\nof the Egyptian priests, which have occasioned the insertion of its\r\nfigure among their hieroglyphics, do not require to have been founded\r\nin nature. Supposing, therefore, that an individual of this species\r\nhad been seen which had lost one of its horns by some accident, it\r\nmight have been taken as a representative of the whole race, and\r\nerroneously adopted by Aristotle, and copied by his successors. All\r\nthis is possible, and even natural, and yet proves nothing with\r\nregard to the existence of a single-horned species.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Indian ass, if we attend to the properties ascribed\r\nto its horns as an antidote against poison, we shall see that they\r\nare precisely the same as those which the eastern nations attribute\r\nat the present day to the horn of the rhinoceros. When this horn was\r\nfirst imported into Greece, the animal to which it belonged might\r\nstill have been unknown. In fact, Aristotle makes no mention of the\r\nrhinoceros, and Agatharchides was the first who described it. In\r\nthe same manner, ivory was in use among the ancients long before\r\nthey were acquainted with the elephant. It is even possible that\r\nsome of their travellers might have given to the rhinoceros the name\r\nof _Indian ass_, with as much propriety as the Romans denominated\r\nthe elephant the _bull of Lucania._ Every thing, moreover, that\r\nis said of the strength, size, and ferocity of this wild ass of\r\ntheirs, corresponds very well with the rhinoceros. In succeeding\r\ntimes, naturalists, who had now become better acquainted with the\r\nrhinoceros, finding this denomination of _Indian ass_ in the writings\r\nof authors who had preceded them, might have taken it, from want\r\nof proper examination, for that of a distinct animal; and from the\r\nname, they would have concluded the animal should have solid hoofs.\r\nThere is, indeed, a full description of the Indian ass given by\r\nCtesias[80], but we have seen above that it had been taken from the\r\nbas-reliefs of Persepolis, and must therefore go for nothing in the\r\nreal history of the animal.\r\n\r\nWhen there afterwards appeared more exact descriptions of an animal\r\nhaving a single horn only, but with several toes, a third species\r\nwould have been made out, to which they gave the name of _monoceros_.\r\nThese double references applied to the same species, are more\r\nfrequent among ancient naturalists, because most of their works which\r\nhave come down to us were mere compilations; even because Aristotle\r\nhimself has frequently mingled facts borrowed from others with those\r\nwhich he had observed himself; and because the habit of critical\r\nexamination was then as little known among naturalists as among\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nFrom all these reasonings and digressions, it may be fairly\r\nconcluded, that the large animals of the old continent with which we\r\nare now acquainted, were known to the ancients; and that the animals\r\ndescribed by the ancients, and which are now unknown, were fabulous.\r\nIt also follows, that the large animals of the three principal parts\r\nof the then discovered world could not have been long in being known\r\nto the nations which frequented their coasts.\r\n\r\nIt may also be concluded, that no large species remains to be\r\ndiscovered in America. If there were any, there can be no reason\r\nwhy we should not be acquainted with it; and in fact none has been\r\ndiscovered there during the last hundred and fifty years. The tapir,\r\nthe jaguar, the puma, the cabiai, the llama, the vicuna, the red\r\nwolf, the buffalo or American bison, the ant-eaters, sloths and\r\narmadilloes, are as well described by Margrave and Hernandez as by\r\nBuffon; it may even be said that they are better, for Buffon has\r\nconfused the history of the ant-eaters, mistaken the jaguar and\r\nred wolf, and confounded the bison of America with the aurochs of\r\nPoland. Pennant, it is true, was the first naturalist who clearly\r\ndistinguished the small musk ox; but it was long before made mention\r\nof by travellers. The cloven-footed horse of Molina, has not been\r\ndescribed by the early Spanish travellers; but its existence is\r\nmore than doubtful, and the authority of Molina is too suspicious\r\nto authorise our adopting it. It might be possible to characterise\r\nmore accurately than has been done the different species of deer\r\nbelonging to America and India; but the case is with respect to these\r\nanimals as it was among the ancients with respect to the antelopes;\r\nit is the want of a good method for distinguishing them, and not\r\nof opportunities of seeing them, that has left them so imperfectly\r\nknown to us. It may, therefore, be said, that the Mouflon of the Blue\r\nMountains is the only American quadruped of any considerable size of\r\nwhich the discovery is altogether modern; and even it is perhaps only\r\nan argali that may have crossed upon the ice from Siberia.\r\n\r\nHow should it be thought, after this, that the huge _mastodons_ and\r\ngigantic _megatheria_, whose bones have been discovered under ground\r\nin North and South America, still exist alive on that continent? How\r\nshould they have escaped those wandering tribes which continually\r\ntraverse the country in all directions, and which are themselves\r\naware that these animals no longer exist, since they have invented a\r\nfabulous account of their destruction, alleging that they were killed\r\nby the Great Spirit, to prevent them from extirpating the human\r\nrace. But it is evident that this fable has been occasioned by the\r\ndiscovery of the bones, like that of the inhabitants of Siberia with\r\nrespect to their mammoth, which they pretend to live under ground\r\nlike the mole, and, like all those of the ancients, about the graves\r\nof giants, who were thought by them to have been buried wherever the\r\nbones of elephants were discovered.\r\n\r\nThus it may safely be concluded, that if, as we have just said, none\r\nof the large species of quadrupeds whose remains are at the present\r\nday found in regular mineral strata, bear resemblance to any of the\r\nknown living species, this is not the effect of mere chance, nor\r\nbecause those species of which we possess nothing but the bones,\r\nare still concealed in the deserts, and have hitherto eluded the\r\nobservation of travellers. On the contrary, this phenomenon must be\r\nregarded as resulting from general causes; and its investigation may\r\nbe considered as affording one of the best means for discovering the\r\nnature of these causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulty of determining the Fossil Bones of Quadrupeds._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this study is more satisfactory in its results than that of other\r\nfossil remains of animals, it is also beset with more numerous\r\ndifficulties. Fossil shells usually present themselves in an entire\r\nstate, and with all the characters requisite for comparing them with\r\ntheir analogous species, preserved in the collections or figured in\r\nthe works of naturalists. Even fishes present their skeleton more\r\nor less entire; the general form of their body is almost always\r\ndistinguishable, and most commonly, also, their generic and specific\r\ncharacters, which are drawn from their solid parts. In quadrupeds,\r\non the contrary, even should the skeleton be found entire, it would\r\nbe difficult to apply to it characters derived, for the most part,\r\nfrom the hair, the colours, and other marks which have disappeared\r\nprevious to their incrustation. It is even excessively rare to find a\r\nfossil skeleton approaching in any considerable degree to a complete\r\nstate. The strata, for the most part, only contain separate bones,\r\nscattered confusedly, and almost always broken, and reduced to\r\nfragments; and these constitute the only resources of knowledge to\r\nthe naturalist in this department. It may also be stated, that most\r\nobservers, deterred by these difficulties, have passed slightly over\r\nthe fossil bones of quadrupeds; have classed them in a vague manner,\r\naccording to superficial resemblances, or have not even ventured\r\nto assign them a name; so that this part of the history of fossil\r\nremains, although the most important and most instructive of all, is,\r\nat the same time, that which has been the least cultivated[81].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principle by which this determination is effected._\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, comparative anatomy possesses a principle, which, when\r\nproperly developed, enables us to surmount all the obstacles. This\r\nprinciple consists in the mutual relation of forms in organised\r\nbeings, by means of which, each species may be determined, with\r\nperfect certainty, by any fragment of any of its parts.\r\n\r\nEvery organised being forms a whole,--a peculiar system of its own,\r\nthe parts of which mutually correspond, and concur in producing\r\nthe same definitive action, by a reciprocal reaction. None of\r\nthese parts can change in form, without the others also changing;\r\nand consequently, each of them, taken separately, indicates and\r\nascertains all the others.\r\n\r\nThus, if the intestines of an animal are so organised as to be\r\nfitted for the digestion of flesh only, and that flesh recent, it\r\nis necessary that its jaws be so constructed as to fit them for\r\ndevouring live prey; its claws for seizing and tearing it; its teeth\r\nfor cutting and dividing it; the whole system of its organs of\r\nmotion, for pursuing and overtaking it; and its organs of sense for\r\ndiscovering it at a distance. It is even requisite that nature have\r\nplaced in its brain the instinct necessary for teaching it to conceal\r\nitself, and to lay snares for its victims.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general conditions which nature imposes upon the\r\nstructure of carnivorous animals; and which every animal of this\r\ndescription must indispensably combine in its constitution, for\r\nwithout them its race could not subsist. But subordinate to these\r\ngeneral conditions, there exist others, having relation to the size,\r\nthe species, and the haunts of the prey for which the animal is\r\nadapted; and from each of these particular conditions, there result\r\nmodifications of detail in the forms which arise from the general\r\nconditions. Thus not only the class, but the order, the genus, and\r\neven the species, are found expressed in the form of each part.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in order that the jaw may be able to seize, it must have\r\na certain form of condyle; that the resistance, the moving power,\r\nand the fulcrum, should have a certain relative position in regard\r\nto each other; and that the temporal muscles should be of a certain\r\nsize; the hollow or depression, too, in which these muscles are\r\nlodged, must have a certain depth; and the zygomatic arch, under\r\nwhich they pass, must not only have a certain degree of convexity,\r\nbut it must be sufficiently strong to support the action of the\r\nmasseter.\r\n\r\nIn order that the animal may be able to carry off its prey, it must\r\nhave a certain degree of vigour in the muscles which elevate the\r\nhead; whence there results a determinate form in the vertebræ from\r\nwhich these muscles take their rise, and in the occiput into which\r\nthey are inserted.\r\n\r\nIn order that the teeth may be able to cut flesh, they must be\r\nsharp-edged, and must be so in a greater or less degree, according\r\nas they have flesh more or less exclusively to cut. Their base will\r\nbe solid, according to the quantity and size of the bones which they\r\nhave to break. The whole of these circumstances must necessarily\r\ninfluence the development and form of all the parts which contribute\r\nto move the jaws.\r\n\r\nIn order that the paws may be able to seize the prey, there must be\r\na certain degree of mobility in the toes, and a certain degree of\r\nstrength in the claws, from which there will result determinate forms\r\nin all the phalanges, and a corresponding distribution of muscles and\r\ntendons. The fore-arm, or cubitus, must possess a certain facility\r\nof turning, from which there will also result determinate forms in\r\nthe bones of which it is composed. But the bones of the cubitus\r\nbeing articulated to the humerus, a change in the proportions of the\r\nformer, will necessarily induce a corresponding change in the latter.\r\nThe shoulder-bones must have a certain degree of firmness in such\r\nanimals as make use of their fore-legs for seizing, and from this\r\nthere must also result a certain peculiarity in their form. The play\r\nof all these parts will require certain proportions in all their\r\nmuscles, and the impressions made by these muscles so proportioned,\r\nwill determine still more particularly the forms of the bones.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that similar conclusions may be drawn with regard\r\nto the posterior extremities which contribute to the rapidity of\r\nthe general motions; with regard to the composition of the trunk,\r\nand the forms of the vertebræ, which exert an influence upon the\r\nfacility and flexibility of these motions; and, lastly, with regard\r\nto the forms of the bones of the nose, of the orbit, and of the\r\near, the connection of which with the perfection of the senses of\r\nsmell, sight, and hearing, is evident. In a word, the form of the\r\ntooth regulates the forms of the condyle, of the scapula, and of the\r\nclaws, in the same manner as the equation of a curve regulates all\r\nits properties; and as, by taking each property separately for the\r\nbase of a particular equation, we find both the ordinary equation,\r\nand all the other properties whatever; so, the claw, the scapula, the\r\ncondyle, the femur, and all the other bones taken separately, give\r\nthe tooth, or are reciprocally given by it; and thus, by commencing\r\nwith any one of these bones, a person who possesses an accurate\r\nknowledge of the laws of organic economy, may reconstruct the whole\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThis principle seems sufficiently evident, in the general acceptation\r\nin which it is here taken, and does not require any fuller\r\ndemonstration; but when it comes to be applied, there will be found\r\nmany cases where our theoretical knowledge of the relations of forms\r\nwill not be sufficient, unless it be supported by observation and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nFor example, we are well aware, that hoofed animals must all be\r\nherbivorous, since they have no means of seizing prey. It is also\r\nevident, that, having no other use to make of their fore-legs than\r\nto support their body, they do not require a shoulder so vigorously\r\norganised as that of carnivorous animals; they have, therefore, no\r\nacromion or clavicle, and their shoulder-blades are narrow. Having\r\nalso no occasion to turn their fore-arm, their radius is united to\r\nthe ulna by ossification, or at least articulated by a ginglimus\r\nor hinge-joint, and not by arthrodia or ball and socket, to the\r\nhumerus. Their food being herbaceous, will require teeth furnished\r\nwith flat surfaces, for bruising seeds and plants. The crown of the\r\nteeth must also be unequal, and, for this purpose, must be composed\r\nof parts alternately consisting of bone and of enamel. Teeth of\r\nthis structure necessarily require horizontal motions to enable\r\nthem to triturate the food; and hence the condyle of the jaw cannot\r\nbe so strictly confined within its articulating cavity as in the\r\ncarnivorous animals, but must be flattened, and thus correspond with\r\na more or less flattened surface of the temporal bones. Further, the\r\ntemporal fossa, which will only have a small muscle to contain, will\r\nbe narrower, and not so shallow, as that of carnivorous animals.\r\nAll these circumstances are deducible from each other, according to\r\ntheir greater or less generality, and in such a manner, that some of\r\nthem are essential and exclusively peculiar to hoofed animals, while\r\nothers, although equally necessary in these animals, are not entirely\r\npeculiar to them, but may occur in other animals also, where the rest\r\nof the conditions will permit their existence.\r\n\r\nIf we proceed to consider the orders or subdivisions of the class of\r\nhoofed animals, and examine what modifications the general conditions\r\nundergo, or rather what particular conditions are conjoined with\r\nthem, according to the respective characters of these orders, the\r\nreasons of these subordinate conditions begin to appear less obvious.\r\nWe can still easily conceive, in general, the necessity of a more\r\ncomplicated system of digestive organs in those species which have\r\na more imperfect masticatory system; and hence we may presume, that\r\nthese latter must be rather ruminating animals, in which there is\r\nwanting such or such an order of teeth; and may also deduce from the\r\nsame consideration, the necessity of a certain form of the œsophagus,\r\nand of corresponding forms in the vertebræ of the neck, &c. But I\r\ndoubt whether it would have been discovered, independently of actual\r\nobservation, that the ruminating animals should all have cloven\r\nhoofs, and that they should be the only animals having them; that\r\nthere should be horns on the fore-head in this class alone; or that\r\nsuch of them as have sharp canine teeth, should, in general, have no\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nHowever, since these relations are constant, we may be assured that\r\nthey have a sufficient cause; but as we are not acquainted with that\r\ncause, we must supply the defect of theory by means of observation,\r\nand in this way establish empirical laws which become nearly as\r\ncertain as those deduced from rational principles, when founded\r\nupon observations, the authenticity of which is proved by frequent\r\nrepetition. Hence, at the present day, any one who observes only the\r\nprint of a cloven foot, may conclude that the animal which left this\r\nimpression ruminates; and this conclusion is quite as certain as\r\nany other in physics, or in moral philosophy. This simple footmark,\r\ntherefore, indicates at once to the observer the forms of the teeth,\r\nof the jaws, of the vertebræ, of all the bones of the legs, thighs,\r\nshoulders, and pelvis of the animal which had passed. It is a surer\r\nmark than all those of Zadig. That there are secret reasons, however,\r\nfor all these relations, is what observation alone is sufficient to\r\nshew, independently of any general principles of philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when we construct a table of these relations, we remark\r\nnot only a specific constancy, if the expression may be allowed,\r\nbetween a particular form of a particular organ, and some other form\r\nof a different organ; but we also perceive a classic constancy of\r\nconformation, and a corresponding gradation, in the development of\r\nthese two organs, which demonstrate their mutual influence, almost as\r\nwell as the most perfect deduction of reason.\r\n\r\nFor example, the dentary system of the hoofed animals, which are not\r\nruminant, is in general more perfect than that of the cloven-footed\r\nor ruminating animals, because the former have either incisors, or\r\ncanine teeth, and almost always both in each jaw; and the structure\r\nof their foot is in general more complicated, because they have more\r\ntoes or claws, or their phalanges less enveloped in the hoof,--or a\r\ngreater number of distinct bones in the metacarpus and metatarsus--or\r\nmore numerous tarsal bones--or a fibula more distinct from the\r\ntibia--or, lastly, that all these circumstances are often united in\r\nthe same species of animals.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to assign reasons for these relations; but we are\r\ncertain that they are not the effects of chance, because, whenever a\r\ncloven-footed animal manifests, in the arrangement of its teeth some\r\ntendency to approach the animals we now speak of, it also manifests\r\na similar tendency in the arrangement of its feet. Thus the camels,\r\nwhich have canine teeth, and even two or four incisors in the upper\r\njaw, have an additional bone in the tarsus, because their scaphoid\r\nbone is not united to the cuboid, and they have very small hoofs,\r\nwith corresponding phalanges. The musk animals, whose canine teeth\r\nare much developed, have a distinct fibula along the whole length\r\nof their tibia; while the other cloven-footed animals have only, in\r\nplace of a fibula, a small bone articulated at the lower end of the\r\ntibia. There is, therefore, a constant harmony between two organs\r\napparently having no connection; and the gradations of their forms\r\npreserve an uninterrupted correspondence, even in those cases in\r\nwhich we cannot account for their relations.\r\n\r\nNow, by thus adopting the method of observation as a supplementary\r\nmeans, when theory is no longer able to direct our views, we arrive\r\nat astonishing results. The smallest articulating surface of bone, or\r\nthe smallest apophysis, has a determinate character, relative to the\r\nclass, the order, the genus, and the species to which it belonged;\r\ninsomuch, that when one possesses merely a well preserved extremity\r\nof a bone, he can, by careful examination, and the aid of a tolerable\r\nanalogical knowledge, and of accurate comparison, determine all these\r\nthings with as much certainty as if he had the entire animal before\r\nhim. I have often made trial of this method upon portions of known\r\nanimals, before reposing full confidence upon it, in regard to fossil\r\nremains; and it has always proved so completely satisfactory, that\r\nI have no longer any doubts regarding the certainty of the results\r\nwhich it has afforded me.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that I have enjoyed all the advantages which were\r\nnecessary for the undertaking; and that my favourable situation, in\r\nthe Museum of Natural History at Paris, and assiduous research for\r\nnearly thirty years, have procured me skeletons of all the genera\r\nand sub-genera of quadrupeds, and even of many species in some\r\ngenera, and of several varieties of some species. With such means,\r\nit was easy for me to multiply my comparisons, and to verify in all\r\ntheir details the applications which I have made of the various laws\r\ndeducible from such circumstances as have been stated.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here enter into a more lengthened detail of this method,\r\nand must refer to the large work on Comparative Anatomy, in which all\r\nits rules will be found. In the mean time, an intelligent reader may\r\ngather a great number of these from the work upon Fossil Bones, if he\r\ntake the trouble of attending to all the applications of them which\r\nwe have there made. He will see, that it is by this method alone that\r\nwe are guided, and that it has almost always sufficed for referring\r\neach bone to its species, when it was a living species--to its genus,\r\nwhen it was an unknown species--to its order, when it was a new\r\ngenus--and to its class, when it belonged to an order not hitherto\r\nestablished--and to assign it, in the three last cases, the proper\r\ncharacters for distinguishing it from the nearest resembling orders,\r\ngenera, and species. Before the commencement of our researches,\r\nnaturalists had done no more than this with regard to animals, which\r\nthey had the opportunity of examining in their entire state. Yet, in\r\nthis manner, we have determined and classed the _remains_ of more\r\nthan a hundred and fifty mammiferous and oviparous quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_View of the General Results of these Researches._\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidered with regard to species, upwards of ninety of these animals\r\nare most assuredly hitherto unknown to naturalists; eleven or twelve\r\nhave so perfect a resemblance to species already known, that the\r\nslightest doubt cannot be entertained of their identity; the others\r\nexhibit many traits of resemblance to known species, but their\r\ncomparison has not yet been made with sufficient precision to remove\r\nall doubts.\r\n\r\nConsidered with regard to genera, of the ninety hitherto unknown\r\nspecies, there are nearly sixty that belong to new genera. The other\r\nspecies rank under genera or subgenera already known.\r\n\r\nIt may not be without use, also, to consider these animals with\r\nregard to the classes and orders to which they belong. Of the hundred\r\nand fifty species, about a fourth part are oviparous quadrupeds, and\r\nall the rest mammifera. Of these last, more than the half belong to\r\nnon-ruminant hoofed animals.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding what has been done, it would still be premature to\r\nestablish upon these numbers any conclusion relative to the theory\r\nof the earth, because they are not in sufficient proportion to the\r\nnumbers of genera and species which may be buried in the strata of\r\nthe earth. Hitherto the bones of the larger species have been chiefly\r\ncollected, these being more obvious to agricultural labourers; while\r\nthe bones of the smaller species are usually neglected, unless when\r\nthey chance to fall into the hands of a naturalist, or when some\r\nparticular circumstance, such as their excessive abundance in certain\r\nplaces, attracts the attention even of the common people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations of the Species of Fossil Animals with the Strata in which\r\nthey are found._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important consideration, that which, in fact, is the chief\r\nobject of all my researches, and which establishes their legitimate\r\nconnection with the Theory of the Earth, is to ascertain in what\r\nstrata each species is found, and whether there may be some general\r\nlaws, relative either to the zoological subdivisions, or to the\r\ngreater or less resemblance of the species to those of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe laws which have been recognised with respect to these relations\r\nare very distinct and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is clearly ascertained that the oviparous\r\nquadrupeds appear much more early than the viviparous; that they are\r\neven more abundant, larger, and more varied, in the ancient strata\r\nthan at the surface of the globe, as it exists at present.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyosauri, the Plesiosauri, several species of Tortoise, and\r\nseveral species of Crocodile, are found beneath the chalk, in the\r\ndeposits commonly called _Jura formations_. The Monitors of Thuringia\r\nwould be still older, if, according to the Wernerian School, the\r\ncopper-slate in which they are contained, along with a great variety\r\nof fishes supposed to have belonged to fresh-water, is to be placed\r\namong the oldest beds of the secondary formations. The enormous\r\ncrocodiles and the great tortoises of Maestricht, are found in the\r\nchalk formation itself; but these are marine animals.\r\n\r\nThis earliest appearance of fossil bones seems, therefore, already\r\nto indicate, that dry lands and fresh waters had existed before the\r\nformation of the chalk deposits. But neither at this period, nor\r\nwhile the chalk was forming, nor even long after, have any bones of\r\nland-mammifera been encrusted; or, at least, the small number of\r\nthese, which are alleged to have been found in strata of these dates,\r\nforms but a trifling exception.\r\n\r\nWe begin to find bones of marine mammifera, namely, of lamantins and\r\nseals, in the coarse shelly limestone which covers the chalk in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris; but there are still no bones of terrestrial\r\nmammifera.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the most assiduous investigation, I have not been\r\nable to discover any distinct trace of this class in any of the\r\ndeposits preceding those which rest upon the coarse limestone.\r\nCertain lignites and molasses do in fact contain them; but I am very\r\ndoubtful whether these deposits are all, as is commonly supposed,\r\nanterior to that limestone. The places where these bones have\r\nbeen found are so limited, both in extent and in number, as to\r\ninduce us to suppose some irregularity, or some repetition of the\r\nformation containing them. On the contrary, the moment we arrive\r\nat the deposits which rest upon the coarse limestone, the bones of\r\nland-animals present themselves in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAs it is reasonable to believe that shells and fishes did not exist\r\nat the period of the formation of primitive rocks, we are also led\r\nto conclude that the oviparous quadrupeds began to exist along with\r\nthe fishes, and at the commencement of the period during which the\r\nsecondary rocks were formed; but that the land-quadrupeds did not\r\nappear upon the earth, at least in any considerable number, till\r\nlong after, and until the coarse limestone strata, which contain the\r\ngreater number of our genera of shells, although of species different\r\nfrom ours, had been deposited.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that those coarse limestone strata which are used\r\nat Paris for building, are the last formed strata which indicate a\r\nlong and quiet continuance of the sea upon our continents. Above\r\nthem, indeed, there are found formations containing shells and other\r\nmarine productions; but these consist of collections of transported\r\nmatters, sand, marls, sandstones, and clays, which rather indicate\r\ntransportations that have taken place with more or less violence,\r\nthan strata formed by tranquil deposition; and, if there be some\r\nrocky and regular strata of pretty considerable magnitude, beneath or\r\nabove these transported matters, they generally exhibit indications\r\nof having been deposited from fresh water.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the known bones of viviparous quadrupeds, therefore, have\r\nbeen found either in those fresh-water formations, or in the alluvial\r\nformations; and consequently there is every reason to conclude that\r\nthese quadrupeds have only begun to exist, or, at least, to leave\r\ntheir remains in the strata of our earth, after the last retreat of\r\nthe sea but one, and during the state of things that preceded its\r\nlast irruption.\r\n\r\nBut there is also an order in the disposition of these bones with\r\nregard to each other; and this order further announces a very\r\nremarkable succession in the appearance of the different species.\r\nAll the genera which are now unknown, the Palæotheria, Anaplotheria,\r\n&c., with the position of which we are thoroughly acquainted, belong\r\nto the oldest of the formations of which we are now speaking, those\r\nwhich rest immediately upon the coarse limestone. It is chiefly these\r\ngenera which occupy the regular beds that have been deposited from\r\nfresh-water, or certain alluvial beds of very ancient formation,\r\ngenerally composed of sand and rolled pebbles, and which were perhaps\r\nthe earliest alluvium of that ancient world. Along with these there\r\nare also found some lost species of known genera, but in small\r\nnumbers, and some oviparous quadrupeds and fishes, which appear to\r\nhave been all inhabitants of fresh-water. The beds which contain them\r\nare always more or less covered by alluvial beds, containing shells,\r\nand other marine productions.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of the unknown species, which belong to known\r\ngenera, or to genera closely allied to those which are known, such as\r\nthe fossil elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, and mastodons, do\r\nnot occur along with those more ancient genera. It is in the alluvial\r\nformations alone that they are discovered, sometimes accompanied\r\nwith marine shells, and sometimes with fresh-water shells, but never\r\nin regular stony beds. Every thing that is found along with these\r\nspecies is either unknown like themselves, or at least doubtful.\r\n\r\nLastly, the bones of species which are apparently the same as those\r\nthat are still found alive, are never discovered, except in the last\r\nalluvial deposits formed on the sides of rivers, or on the bottoms\r\nof ancient pools or marshes now dried up, or in the substance of beds\r\nof peat, or in the fissures and caverns of some rocks; or, lastly, at\r\nsmall depths below the surface, in places where they may have been\r\nburied by the falling down of debris, or even by the hand of man; and\r\ntheir superficial position renders these bones, although the most\r\nrecent of all, almost always the worst preserved.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be thought that this classification of the\r\nvarious geological positions of fossil remains, is as certain as that\r\nof the species, or that it is equally capable of demonstration. There\r\nare numerous reasons which prevent this from being the case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, all my determinations of species have been made\r\nupon the bones themselves, or by means of good figures; whereas it\r\nhas been impossible for me personally to examine all the places in\r\nwhich these bones have been discovered. I have very frequently been\r\nobliged to content myself with vague and ambiguous accounts, given by\r\npeople who were not themselves well aware of what it was necessary to\r\nobserve; and, more frequently still, I have been unable to procure\r\nany information whatever on the subject.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these repositories of organic remains are subject to\r\ninfinitely greater doubts, than the bones themselves. The same\r\nformation may appear recent in places where it shews itself at the\r\nsurface, and ancient in those where it is covered by the beds which\r\nhave succeeded it. Ancient formations may have been transported by\r\npartial inundations, and thus have covered recent bones; they may\r\nhave fallen upon them by crumbling, and thus have enveloped and\r\nmingled them with the productions of the ancient sea, which they\r\npreviously contained. Bones of ancient periods may have been washed\r\nout by the waters, and afterwards enveloped in recent alluvial\r\nformations. Lastly, recent bones may have fallen into the fissures\r\nor caverns of ancient rocks, and been enveloped by stalactites or\r\nother incrustations. In every individual instance, therefore, it\r\nbecomes necessary to analyze and appreciate all those circumstances\r\nwhich might disguise the real origin of fossil remains; and it rarely\r\nhappens that people who have collected bones have been themselves\r\naware of this necessity, the consequence of which has been, that the\r\ntrue characters of their geological position have been almost always\r\nneglected or misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there are some doubtful species, which must occasion more\r\nor less uncertainty in the results of our researches, until they\r\nhave been clearly ascertained. Thus the horses and buffaloes that\r\noccur along with the elephants, have not yet received appropriate\r\nspecific characters; and such geologists as are disinclined to adopt\r\nthe different epochs which I have endeavoured to establish with\r\nregard to fossil bones, may, for many years to come, draw from thence\r\nan argument against my system, so much the more convenient as it is\r\ncontained in my own work.\r\n\r\nBut allowing that these epochs are liable to some objections, from\r\nsuch as may only consider some particular case, I am not the less\r\nsatisfied, that those who shall take a comprehensive view of the\r\nphenomena, will not be checked by such inconsiderable and partial\r\ndifficulties, and will be led to conclude, as I have done, that\r\nthere has been at least one, and very probably two, successions in\r\nthe class of quadrupeds, previous to that which at the present day\r\npeoples the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs that the Extinct Species of Quadrupeds are not varieties of\r\nthe presently existing Species._\r\n\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the consideration of another objection, one, in\r\nfact, which has already been urged against me.\r\n\r\nWhy may not the presently existing races of land quadrupeds, it has\r\nbeen asked, be modifications of those ancient races which we find in\r\na fossil state; which modifications may have been produced by local\r\ncircumstances and change of climate; and carried to the extreme\r\ndifference which they now present, during a long succession of ages?\r\n\r\nThis objection must appear strong to those especially who believe\r\nin the possibility of indefinite alteration of forms in organised\r\nbodies; and who think that, during a succession of ages, and by\r\nrepeated changes of habitudes, all the species might be changed into\r\none another, or might result from a single species.\r\n\r\nYet to these persons an answer may be given from their own system. If\r\nthe species have changed by degrees, we ought to find traces of these\r\ngradual modifications. Thus, between the palæotheria and our present\r\nspecies, we should be able to discover some intermediate forms; and\r\nyet no such discovery has ever been made.\r\n\r\nWhy have not the bowels of the earth preserved the monuments of so\r\nstrange a genealogy, if it be not because the species of former times\r\nwere as constant as ours; or, at least, because the catastrophe which\r\ndestroyed them, had not left them sufficient time for undergoing the\r\nvariation alleged?\r\n\r\nIn order to reply to those naturalists who acknowledge that the\r\n_varieties_ of animals are restrained within certain limits fixed by\r\nnature, it would be necessary to examine how far these limits extend.\r\nThis is a very curious inquiry,--highly interesting in itself, under\r\na variety of relations, and yet one that has been hitherto very\r\nlittle attended to.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon this inquiry, it is proper to define what is\r\nmeant by a _species_, so that the definition may serve to regulate\r\nthe employment of the term. A species, therefore, may be defined,\r\nas comprehending _the individuals which descend from each other,\r\nor from common parents, and those which resemble them as much as\r\nthey resemble each other_. Thus, we consider as _varieties_ of a\r\nspecies, only the races more or less different which may have sprung\r\nfrom it by generation. Our observations, therefore, regarding the\r\ndifferences between the ancestors and descendants, afford us the\r\nonly certain rule by which we can judge on this subject; all other\r\nconsiderations leading to hypothetical conclusions destitute of\r\nproof. Now, considering the _varieties_ in this view, we observe\r\nthat the differences which constitute it, depend upon determinate\r\ncircumstances, and that their extent increases in proportion to the\r\nintensity of these circumstances.\r\n\r\nThus, the most superficial characters are the most variable: the\r\ncolour depends much upon the light; the thickness of the fur upon the\r\nheat; the size, upon the abundance of food. But in a wild animal,\r\neven these varieties are greatly limited by the natural habits of the\r\nanimal itself, which does not voluntarily remove far from the places\r\nwhere it finds, in the necessary degree, all that is requisite, for\r\nthe support of its species, and does not even extend its haunts to\r\nany great distance, unless it also finds all these circumstances\r\nconjoined. Thus, although the wolf and the fox inhabit all the\r\nclimates from the torrid to the frigid zone, we hardly find any other\r\ndifference among them, in the whole of that vast space, than a little\r\nmore or a little less beauty in their fur. I have compared skulls of\r\nfoxes from the northern countries and from Egypt, with those of the\r\nfoxes of France, and have found no difference but such as might be\r\nexpected in different individuals. Such of the wild animals as are\r\nconfined within narrower limits, vary still less, especially those\r\nwhich are carnivorous. The only difference between the hyena of\r\nPersia and that of Morocco, consists in a thicker or a thinner mane.\r\n\r\nThe wild herbivorous animals feel the influence of climate somewhat\r\nmore extensively, because there is added to it in their case, the\r\ninfluence of the food, which may happen to differ both as to quantity\r\nand quality. Thus, the elephants of one forest are often larger than\r\nthose of another; and their tusks are somewhat longer in places where\r\ntheir food may happen to be more favourable for the production of the\r\nmatter of ivory. The same may take place with regard to the horns\r\nof rein-deer and stags. But let us compare two elephants the most\r\ndissimilar, and we shall not discover the slightest difference in the\r\nnumber and articulations of the bones, the structure of the teeth, &c.\r\n\r\nBesides, the herbivorous species, in the wild state, seem more\r\nrestrained from dispersing than the carnivorous animals, because the\r\nsort of food which they require, combines with the temperature to\r\nprevent them.\r\n\r\nNature also takes care to guard against the alteration of the\r\nspecies, which might result from their mixture, by the mutual\r\naversion with which it has inspired them. It requires all the\r\ningenuity and all the power of man to accomplish these unions, even\r\nbetween species that have the nearest resemblances. And, when the\r\nindividuals produced by these forced conjunctions are fruitful, which\r\nis very seldom the case, their fecundity does not continue beyond a\r\nfew generations; and would not probably proceed so far, without a\r\ncontinuance of the same cares which excited it at first. Thus, we\r\nnever see in our woods individuals intermediate between the hare and\r\nthe rabbit; between the stag and the doe; or between the martin and\r\nthe pole-cat.\r\n\r\nBut the power of man changes this order; it discloses all those\r\nvariations, of which the type of each species is susceptible;\r\nand from them derives productions which the species, if left to\r\nthemselves, would never have yielded.\r\n\r\nHere the degree of the variations is still proportional to the\r\nintensity of their cause, which is slavery. It is not very high in\r\nthe semi-domesticated species, such as the cat. A softer fur; more\r\nbrilliant colours; greater or less size; these form the whole extent\r\nof the variations in this species; for the skeleton of an Angora cat\r\ndiffers in no regular and constant circumstance from that of a wild\r\ncat.\r\n\r\nIn the domesticated herbivorous animals, which we transport into\r\nall kinds of climates, and subject to all kinds of management, both\r\nwith regard to labour and nourishment, we certainly obtain greater\r\nvariations; but still they are all merely superficial. Greater\r\nor less size; longer or shorter horns, or even the want of these\r\nentirely; a hump of fat, larger or smaller, on the shoulder; these\r\nform the differences between the various races of the common ox or\r\nbull; and these differences continue long, even in such breeds as\r\nhave been transported from the countries in which they were produced,\r\nwhen proper care is taken to prevent crossing.\r\n\r\nOf this nature are also the innumerable varieties of the common\r\nsheep, which consist chiefly in differences of their fleeces, as the\r\nwool which they produce is an important object of attention. These\r\nvarieties, although not quite so perceptible, are yet sufficiently\r\nmarked among horses. In general, the forms of the bones vary little;\r\ntheir connections and articulations, and the forms of the large\r\ngrinding teeth, never vary at all.\r\n\r\nThe small size of the tusks in the domestic hog, compared with the\r\nwild boar’s, and the junction of its cloven hoofs into one in some\r\nraces, form the extreme point of the differences which we have\r\nproduced in the domesticated herbivorous quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable effects of the influence of man are manifested\r\nin the animal which he has reduced most completely under subjection,\r\nthe dog,--that species so entirely devoted to ours, that even the\r\nindividuals of it seem to have sacrificed to us their will, their\r\ninterest, and inclination. Transported by man into every part of\r\nthe world, subjected to all the causes capable of influencing their\r\ndevelopment, regulated in their sexual intercourse by the pleasure of\r\ntheir masters, dogs vary in colour; in the quantity of their hair,\r\nwhich they sometimes even lose altogether, and in its nature; in\r\nsize, which varies as one to five in the linear dimensions, amounting\r\nto more than a hundred fold in bulk; in the form of the ears, nose,\r\nand tail; in the proportional length of the legs; in the progressive\r\ndevelopment of the brain in the domestic varieties, whence results\r\nthe form of their head, which is sometimes slender, with a lengthened\r\nmuzzle and flat forehead, and sometimes having a short muzzle and a\r\nprotuberant forehead; insomuch that the apparent differences between\r\na mastiff and a water-spaniel, and between a greyhound and a pug,\r\nare more striking than those that exist between any two species of\r\nthe same natural genus in a wild state. Finally, and this may be\r\nconsidered as the maximum of variation hitherto known in the animal\r\nkingdom, there are races of dogs which have an additional toe on the\r\nhind foot, with corresponding tarsal bones; as there are, in the\r\nhuman species, some families that have six fingers on each hand. Yet,\r\nin all these varieties, the relations of the bones remain the same,\r\nnor does the form of the teeth ever change in any perceptible degree;\r\nthe only variation in respect to these latter being, that, in some\r\nindividuals, one additional false grinder appears, sometimes on the\r\none side, and sometimes on the other[82].\r\n\r\nAnimals, therefore, have natural characters, which resist every kind\r\nof influence, whether natural or produced by human interference, and\r\nnothing indicates that, with regard to them, time has more effect\r\nthan climate and domestication.\r\n\r\nI am aware that some naturalists lay great stress upon the thousands\r\nof ages which they call into action by a dash of the pen; but, in\r\nsuch matters, we can only judge of what a long period of time might\r\nproduce, by multiplying in idea what a less time produces. With\r\nthis view, I have endeavoured to collect the most ancient documents\r\nrelating to the forms of animals; and there are none which equal,\r\neither in antiquity or abundance, those that Egypt furnishes. It\r\naffords us, not only representations of animals, but even their\r\nidentical bodies embalmed in its catacombs.\r\n\r\nI have examined with the greatest attention the figures of quadrupeds\r\nand birds sculptured upon the numerous obelisks brought from Egypt to\r\nancient Rome. All these figures possess, in their general character,\r\nwhich alone could be the object of attention to an artist, a perfect\r\nresemblance to the species represented, such as we see them at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nOn examining the copies made by Kirker and Zoega, we find that,\r\nwithout preserving every trait of the originals in its perfect\r\npurity, they have given figures which are easily recognised. We\r\nreadily distinguish the ibis, the vulture, the owl, the falcon, the\r\nEgyptian goose, the lapwing, the landrail, the aspic, the cerastes,\r\nthe Egyptian hare with its long ears, and even the hippopotamus; and,\r\namong the numerous monuments engraved in the great work on Egypt, we\r\nsometimes observe the rarest animals, the algazel, for example, which\r\nwas not seen in Europe until within these few years[83].\r\n\r\nMy learned colleague, M. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, strongly convinced\r\nof the importance of this research, carefully collected in the tombs\r\nand temples of Upper and Lower Egypt as many mummies of animals as\r\nhe could. He has brought home cats, ibises, birds of prey, dogs,\r\nmonkeys, crocodiles, and the head of an ox, in this state; and there\r\nis certainly no more difference to be perceived between these mummies\r\nand the species of the same kind now alive, than between the human\r\nmummies and the skeletons of men of the present day. A difference\r\nmay, indeed, be found between the mummies of the ibis and the bird\r\nwhich naturalists have hitherto described under that name; but I have\r\ncleared up all doubts on this matter, in a Memoir upon the Ibis,\r\nwhich will be found at the end of this Essay, and in which I have\r\nshewn that it is still at the present day the same as it was in the\r\ntime of the Pharaohs. I am aware that, in these, I only cite the\r\nmonuments of two or three thousand years; but this is the most remote\r\nantiquity to which we can resort in such a case.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, therefore, to be derived from all the facts\r\nhitherto known, that could, in the slightest degree, give support\r\nto the opinion that the new genera which I have discovered or\r\nestablished among the fossil remains of animals, any more than those\r\nwhich have in like manner been discovered or established by other\r\nnaturalists, the _palæotheria_, _anoplotheria_, _megalonyces_,\r\n_mastodonta_, _pterodactyli_, _ichthyosauri_, &c. might have been\r\nthe sources of the present race of animals, which have only differed\r\nfrom them through the influence of time or climate. Even if it should\r\nprove true, which I am far from believing to be the case, that the\r\nfossil elephants, rhinoceroses, elks, and bears, differ no more from\r\nthose at present existing, than the present races of dogs differ from\r\none another, this would not furnish a sufficient reason for inferring\r\nthe general identity of the species, because the races of dogs have\r\nbeen subjected to the influence of domestication, which these other\r\nanimals neither did nor could experience.\r\n\r\nFarther, when I maintain that the rocky beds contain the bones of\r\nseveral genera, and the alluvial strata those of several species\r\nwhich no longer exist, I do not assert that a new creation was\r\nrequired for producing the species existing at the present day. I\r\nonly say that they did not originally inhabit the places where we\r\nfind them at present, and that they must have come from some other\r\npart of the globe.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, for instance, that a great irruption of the sea were\r\nnow to cover the continent of New Holland with a coat of sand or\r\nother debris; it would bury the carcases of animals belonging to the\r\ngenera _Kangurus_, _Phascolomys_, _Dasyurus_, _Perameles_, flying\r\nphalanger, echidna, and ornithorynchus, and it would entirely destroy\r\nthe species of all these genera, since none of them exist now in any\r\nother country.\r\n\r\nWere the same revolution to lay dry the numerous narrow straits which\r\nseparate New Holland from the continent of Asia, it would open a\r\nroad to the elephants, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, horses, camels, and\r\ntigers, and to all the other Asiatic quadrupeds, which would come to\r\npeople a land where they had been previously unknown.\r\n\r\nWere some future naturalist, after having made himself well\r\nacquainted with this new race of animals, to search below the surface\r\non which they live, he would find remains of quite a different\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWhat New Holland would be, under the circumstances which we have\r\nsupposed, Europe, Siberia, and a large portion of America, now\r\nactually are. And, perhaps, when other countries shall have been\r\nexamined, and New Holland among the rest, it will one day be found\r\nthat they have experienced similar revolutions, I might almost say,\r\nmutual changes, of productions. For, if we push the supposition\r\nfarther, and, after the supply of Asiatic animals to New Holland,\r\nadmit a second revolution, which destroyed Asia, their original\r\ncountry, those naturalists who might observe them in New Holland,\r\ntheir second country, would be equally at a loss to know whence\r\nthey had come, as we now are to find out the origin of the races of\r\nanimals that inhabit our own countries.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to apply this manner of reasoning to the human species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs that there are no Fossil Human Bones._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain that no human bones have yet been found among fossil\r\nremains; and this furnishes an additional proof that the fossil races\r\nwere not mere varieties of known species, since they could not have\r\nbeen subjected to human influence.\r\n\r\nWhen I assert that human bones have never been found among fossil\r\norganic remains, (I must be understood to speak of fossils or\r\npetrifactions, properly so called), or, in other words, in the\r\nregular strata of the surface of the globe; for in peat-bogs\r\n(_tourbières_), and alluvial deposits, as in burying-grounds, human\r\nbones might as well be found as bones of horses, or other common\r\nspecies. They might equally be found in fissures of rocks, and in\r\ncaverns, where they may have been covered over by stalactite; but in\r\nthe beds which contain the ancient races, among the _palæotheria_,\r\nand even among the elephants and rhinoceroses, the smallest portion\r\nof a human bone has never been discovered. Many of the labourers in\r\nthe gypsum quarries about Paris, believe that the bones which occur\r\nso abundantly in them, are in a great part human; but I have seen\r\nseveral thousands of these bones, and I may safely affirm that not\r\none of them has ever belonged to our species. I have examined at\r\nPavia the groups of bones brought by Spallanzani from the Island\r\nof Cerigo; and, notwithstanding the assertion of that celebrated\r\nobserver, I equally affirm, that there is not one among them that\r\ncould be shewn to be human. The _homo diluvii testis_ of Scheuchzer\r\nhas been restored, in my first edition, to its true genus, which\r\nis that of the salamanders; and, in a more recent examination of\r\nit at Haarlem, allowed me by the politeness of Mr Van Marum, who\r\npermitted me to uncover the parts enveloped in the stone, I obtained\r\ncomplete proof of what I had before announced. Among the bones found\r\nat Canstadt, the fragment of a jaw, and some articles of human\r\nmanufacture, were found; but it is known that the ground was dug up\r\nwithout any precaution, and that no notes were taken of the different\r\ndepths at which each article was discovered. Every where else, the\r\nfragments of bone alleged to be human, are found, on examination, to\r\nbelong to some animal, whether these fragments have been examined\r\nthemselves, or merely through the medium of figures. Very recently,\r\nsome were pretended to have been discovered at Marseilles, in a\r\nquarry that had been long neglected;[84] but they have turned out to\r\nbe impressions of _tuyaux marines_.[85] Such real human bones as have\r\nbeen exhibited as fossil, belonged to bodies that had fallen into\r\nfissures, or had been left in the old galleries of mines, or that\r\nhad been incrusted; and I extend this assertion even to the human\r\nskeletons discovered at Guadaloupe, in a rock formed of fragments of\r\nmadrepore, thrown up by the sea, and united by water impregnated\r\nwith calcareous matter.[86] The human bones found near Kœstriz, and\r\npointed out by M. de Schlotheim, had been announced as taken out of\r\nvery old beds; but this estimable naturalist is anxious to make known\r\nhow much this assertion is still subject to doubt.[87] The same has\r\nbeen the case with the articles of human fabrication. The pieces of\r\niron found at Montmartre are fragments of the tools which the workmen\r\nuse for putting in blasts of gunpowder, and which sometimes break in\r\nthe stone[88].\r\n\r\nYet human bones preserve equally well with those of animals, when\r\nplaced in the same circumstances. In Egypt, no difference is remarked\r\nbetween the mummies of men and those of quadrupeds. I picked up,\r\nfrom the excavations made some years ago in the ancient church of St\r\nGenevieve, human bones that had been interred below the first race,\r\nwhich may even have belonged to some princes of the family of Clovis,\r\nand which still retained their forms very perfectly[89]. We do not\r\nfind in ancient fields of battle that the skeletons of men are more\r\nwasted than those of horses, except in so far as they may have been\r\ninfluenced by size; and we find among fossil remains the bones of\r\nanimals as small as rats, still perfectly preserved.\r\n\r\nEvery circumstance, therefore, leads to the conclusion, that the\r\nhuman species did not exist in the countries in which the fossil\r\nbones have been discovered, at the epoch of the revolutions by which\r\nthese bones were covered up; for there cannot be a single reason\r\nassigned, why men should have entirely escaped from such general\r\ncatastrophes, or why their remains should not be now found like those\r\nof other animals. I do not presume, however, to conclude that man did\r\nnot exist at all before this epoch. He might then have inhabited some\r\nnarrow regions, whence he might have repeopled the earth after those\r\nterrible events. Perhaps also, the places which he inhabited may have\r\nbeen entirely swallowed up in the abyss, and his bones buried at the\r\nbottom of the present seas, with the exception of a small number of\r\nindividuals, which have continued the species.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the establishment of man in those countries in\r\nwhich we have said that the fossil remains of land animals are found,\r\nthat is to say, in the greatest part of Europe, Asia, and America,\r\nhas necessarily been posterior, not only to the revolutions which\r\nhave covered up these bones, but also to those which have laid bare\r\nthe strata containing them, and which are the last that the globe\r\nhas undergone. Hence it clearly appears, that no argument in favour\r\nof the antiquity of the human species in these different countries\r\ncan be derived either from those bones themselves, or from the more\r\nor less considerable masses of rocks or of earthy materials by which\r\nthey are covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physical Proofs of the Newness of the Present Continents._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, by a careful examination of what has taken place\r\non the surface of the globe, since it has been laid dry for the\r\nlast time, and its continents have assumed their present form, at\r\nleast in the parts that are somewhat elevated, it may be clearly\r\nseen that this last revolution, and consequently the establishment\r\nof our existing societies, could not have been very ancient. This\r\nresult is one of the best established, and, at the same time, one\r\nof the least attended to in rational geology; and it is so much the\r\nmore valuable, that it connects natural and civil history in one\r\nuninterrupted series.\r\n\r\nWhen we measure the effects produced in a given time by causes still\r\nacting, and compare them with those which the same causes have\r\nproduced since they have begun to act, we are enabled to determine\r\nnearly the instant at which their action commenced; which is\r\nnecessarily the same as that in which our continents assumed their\r\npresent form, or that of the last sudden retreat of the waters.\r\n\r\nIt must, in fact, have been since this last retreat of the waters,\r\nthat our present steep declivities have begun to disintegrate, and\r\nto form heaps of debris at their bases; that our present rivers\r\nhave begun to flow, and to deposit their alluvial matters; that our\r\npresent vegetation has begun to extend itself, and to produce soil;\r\nthat our present cliffs have begun to be corroded by the sea; that\r\nour present downs have begun to be thrown up by the wind: just as\r\nit must have been since this same epoch, that colonies of men have\r\nbegun, for the first or second time, to spread themselves, and to\r\nform establishments in places fitted by nature for their reception.\r\nI do not here take the action of volcanoes into account, not only\r\nbecause of the irregularity of their eruptions, but because we have\r\nno proofs of their not having been able to exist under the sea; and\r\nbecause, on that account, they cannot serve us as a measure of the\r\ntime which has elapsed since its last retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Additions of Land by the Action of Rivers._\r\n\r\n\r\nMM. Deluc and Dolomieu have most carefully examined the progress\r\nof the formation of new ground by means of matters washed down by\r\nrivers; and although exceedingly opposed to each other on many points\r\nof the Theory of the Earth, they agree in this. These formations\r\naugment very rapidly; they must have increased still more rapidly at\r\nfirst, when the mountains furnished more materials to the rivers, and\r\nyet their extent is still inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nDolomieu’s Memoir respecting Egypt[90] tends to prove, that the\r\ntongue of land on which Alexander caused his city to be built,\r\ndid not exist in the days of Homer; that they were then able to\r\nnavigate directly from the island of Pharos into the gulf afterwards\r\ncalled _Lake Mareotis_; and that this gulf was then, as indicated\r\nby Menelaus, from fifteen to twenty leagues in length. It had,\r\ntherefore, only required the nine hundred years that elapsed between\r\nthe time of Homer and that of Strabo, to bring things to the state\r\nin which this latter author describes them, and to reduce the gulf\r\nin question to the form of a lake, of six leagues in length. It is\r\nmore certain, that, since that time, things have changed still more.\r\nThe sand thrown up by the sea and winds have formed, between the\r\nisland of Pharos and the site of ancient Alexandria, a tongue of land\r\ntwo hundred fathoms in breadth, upon which the modern city has been\r\nbuilt. It has blocked up the nearest mouth of the Nile, and reduced\r\nthe lake Mareotis to almost nothing; while, during the same period,\r\nthe alluvial matter carried down by the Nile, has been deposited\r\nalong the rest of the shore, and has greatly increased its extent.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were not ignorant of these changes. Herodotus says,\r\nthat the Egyptian priests regarded their country as a gift of the\r\nNile. It is only in a manner, he adds, within a short period, that\r\nthe Delta has appeared[91]. Aristotle observes, that Homer speaks of\r\nThebes as if it had been the only great city in Egypt; and nowhere\r\nmakes mention of Memphis[92]. The Canopian and Pelusian mouths of\r\nthe Nile were formerly the principal ones; and the coast extended in\r\na straight line from the one to the other; and in this manner it\r\nstill appears in the charts of Ptolemy. Since then, the water has\r\nbeen directed into the Bolbitian and Phatnitic mouths; and it is at\r\nthese entrances into the sea that the greatest depositions have been\r\nformed, which have given the coast a semicircular outline. The cities\r\nof Rosetta and Damieta, which were built upon these mouths, close\r\nto the edge of the sea, less than a thousand years ago, are now two\r\nleagues distant from it. According to Demaillet[93], it would only\r\nhave required twenty-six years to form a promontory of half a league\r\nin extent before Rosetta.\r\n\r\nAn elevation is produced in the soil of Egypt, at the same time\r\nthat this extension of its surface takes place, and the bed of the\r\nriver rises in the same proportion as the adjacent plains, which\r\nmakes the inundations of every succeeding century pass far beyond\r\nthe marks which it had left during the preceding ones. According\r\nto Herodotus, a period of nine hundred years was sufficient to\r\nestablish a difference of level amounting to ten or twelve feet. At\r\nElephantia[94], the inundation at present exceeds by seven feet the\r\ngreatest heights which it attained under Septimus Severus, at the\r\ncommencement of the third century. At Cairo, before it is judged\r\nsufficient for the purpose of irrigation, it must exceed, by three\r\nfeet and a half, the height which was necessary in the ninth century.\r\nThe ancient monuments of this celebrated land have all their bases\r\nmore or less buried in the soil. The mud left by the river even\r\ncovers, to a depth of several feet, the artificial mounds on which\r\nthe ancient towns were built[95].\r\n\r\nThe delta of the Rhone is not less remarkable for its increase.\r\nAstruc gives a detailed account of it in his Natural History of\r\nLanguedoc; and proves, by a careful comparison of the descriptions of\r\nMela, Strabo and Pliny, with the state of the places as they existed\r\nat the commencement of the eighteenth century, taking into account\r\nthe statements of several writers of the middle age, that the arms\r\nof the Rhone have increased three leagues in length in the course\r\nof eighteen hundred years; that similar additions of land are made\r\nto the west of the Rhone; and that a number of places, which were\r\nsituated, six or eight hundred years ago, at the edge of the sea or\r\nof large pools, are now several miles distant from the water.\r\n\r\nAny one may observe in Holland and Italy, with what rapidity the\r\nRhine, the Po, and the Arno, since they have been confined within\r\ndikes, raise their beds, advance their mouths into the sea, forming\r\nlong promontories at their sides; and judge, from these facts, how\r\nsmall a number of ages was required by these rivers to deposit the\r\nlow plains which they now traverse.\r\n\r\nMany cities, which were flourishing sea-ports at well known periods\r\nof history, are now some leagues inland; and several have even been\r\nruined, in consequence of this change of position. The inhabitants of\r\nVenice find it exceedingly difficult to preserve the _lagunes_, by\r\nwhich that city is separated from the continent; and notwithstanding\r\nall their efforts, it will be inevitably joined to the mainland[96].\r\n\r\nWe know, from the testimony of Strabo, that Ravenna stood among\r\nlagunes in the time of Augustus, as Venice does now; but at present\r\nRavenna is a league distant from the shore. Spina had been built by\r\nthe Greeks at the edge of the sea; yet in Strabo’s time it was ninety\r\nstadia from it, and is now destroyed. Adria in Lombardy, which gave\r\nname to the Adriatic sea, and of which it was, somewhat more than\r\ntwenty centuries ago, the principal port, is now six leagues distant\r\nfrom it. Fortis has even rendered it probable that, at a more remote\r\nperiod, the Euganian Mountains may have been islands.\r\n\r\nM. de Prony, a learned member of the Institute, and inspector-general\r\nof bridges and roads, has communicated to me some observations which\r\nare of the greatest importance, as explaining those changes that\r\nhave taken place along the shores of the Adriatic[97]. Having been\r\ndirected by government to investigate the remedies that might be\r\napplied to the devastations occasioned by the floods of the Po, he\r\nascertained that this river, since the period when it was shut in\r\nby dikes, has so greatly raised the level of its bottom, that the\r\nsurface of its waters is now higher than the roofs of the houses in\r\nFerrara. At the same time, its alluvial depositions have advanced so\r\nrapidly into the sea, that, by comparing old charts with the present\r\nstate, the shore is found to have gained more than six thousand\r\nfathoms since 1604, giving an average of a hundred and fifty or a\r\nhundred and eighty, and in some places two hundred feet yearly.\r\nThe Adige and the Po, are at the present day higher than the whole\r\ntract of land that lies between them; and it is only by opening\r\nnew channels for them in the low grounds, which they have formerly\r\ndeposited, that the disasters which they now threaten may be averted.\r\n\r\nThe same causes have produced the same effects along the branches of\r\nthe Rhine and the Meuse; and thus the richest districts of Holland\r\nhave continually the frightful view of their rivers held up by\r\nembankments at a height of from twenty to thirty feet above the level\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nM. Wiebeking, director of bridges and highways in the kingdom of\r\nBavaria, has written a memoir upon this subject, so important as to\r\nbe worthy of being properly understood, both by the people and the\r\ngovernment, in all countries where these changes take place. In this\r\nmemoir, he shews that the property of raising the level of their beds\r\nis common in a greater or less degree to all rivers.\r\n\r\nThe additions of land that have been made along the shores of the\r\nNorth Sea, have not been less rapid in their progress than in\r\nItaly. They can be easily traced in Friesland and in the country\r\nof Groningen, where the epoch of the first dikes, constructed by\r\nthe Spanish governor Gaspar Roblès, is well known to have been in\r\n1570. An hundred years afterwards, land had already been gained,\r\nin some places, to the extent of three quarters of a league beyond\r\nthese dikes; and even the city of Groningen, partly built upon the\r\nold land, on a limestone which does not belong to the present sea,\r\nand in which the same shells are found as in the coarse limestone\r\nof the neighbourhood of Paris, is only six leagues from the sea.\r\nHaving been upon the spot, I am enabled to adduce my own testimony\r\nin confirmation of facts already well known, and which have been so\r\nwell stated by M. Deluc[98]. The same phenomenon may be as distinctly\r\nobserved along the coasts of East Friesland, and the countries of\r\nBremen and Holstein, as the period at which the new grounds were\r\ninclosed for the first time is known, and the extent that has been\r\ngained since can be measured. This new alluvial land, formed by the\r\nrivers and the sea, is of astonishing fertility, and is so much\r\nthe more valuable, as the ancient soil of these countries, being\r\ncovered with heaths and peat-mosses, is almost everywhere unfit\r\nfor cultivation. The alluvial lands alone produce subsistence for\r\nthe many populous cities that have been built along these coasts,\r\nsince the middle age, and which perhaps would not have attained\r\ntheir present flourishing condition, without the aid of the rich\r\ndeposits which the rivers had prepared for them, and which they are\r\ncontinually augmenting.\r\n\r\nIf the size which Herodotus attributes to the Sea of Asoph, which he\r\nmakes equal to the Euxine[99], had been less vaguely indicated, and\r\nif we knew precisely what he meant by the Gerrhus[100], we should\r\nthere find strong additional proofs of the changes produced by\r\nrivers, and the rapidity with which they are made; for the alluvial\r\ndepositions of rivers alone have, since the time of Herodotus, that\r\nis to say, in the course of two thousand and two or three hundred\r\nyears, reduced the Sea of Asoph[101] to its present comparatively\r\nsmall size, shut up the course of the Gerrhus, or that branch of\r\nthe Dnieper which had formerly joined the Hypacyris, and discharged\r\nits waters along with that river into the gulf called Carcinites,\r\nnow the Olu-Degnitz, and reduced the Hypacyris itself to almost\r\nnothing[102]. We should possess proofs no less strong of the same\r\nkind, could we be certain that the Oxus or Sihoun, which at present\r\ndischarges itself into the lake Aral, formerly reached the Caspian\r\nSea. But we are in possession of facts sufficiently conclusive on\r\nthe point in question, without adducing such as are doubtful, and\r\nwithout being exposed to the necessity of making the ignorance of the\r\nancients in geography the basis of our physical propositions.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Progress of the Downs._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe downs or hillocks of sand which the sea throws up on low coasts,\r\nwhen its bottom is sandy, have already been mentioned. Wherever human\r\nindustry has not succeeded in fixing these downs, they advance as\r\nirresistibly upon the land as the alluvial depositions of the rivers\r\nadvance into the sea. In their progress inland, they push before them\r\nthe large pools formed by the rain which falls upon the neighbouring\r\ngrounds, and whose communication with the sea is intercepted by them.\r\nIn many places they proceed with a frightful rapidity, overwhelming\r\nforests, buildings, and cultivated fields. Those upon the coast of\r\nthe Bay of Biscay[104] have already overwhelmed a great number of\r\nvillages mentioned in the records of the middle age; and at this\r\nmoment, in the single Department of the _Landes_, they threaten\r\nten with inevitable destruction. One of these villages, named\r\nMimisan, has been struggling against them these twenty years, with\r\nthe melancholy prospect of a sand-hill of more than sixty feet\r\nperpendicular height visibly approaching it.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, the pent up pools overwhelmed five fine farming\r\nestablishments at the village of St Julian[105]. They have long\r\ncovered up an ancient Roman road leading from Bourdeaux to Bayonne,\r\nand which could still be seen forty years ago, when the waters\r\nwere low[106]. The Adour, which is known to have formerly passed\r\nOld Boucaut, to join the sea at Cape Breton, is now turned to the\r\ndistance of more than two thousand yards.\r\n\r\nThe late M. Bremontier, inspector of bridges and highways, who\r\nconducted extensive operations upon these downs, estimated their\r\nprogress at sixty feet yearly, and in some places at seventy-two\r\nfeet. According to this calculation, it will only require two\r\nthousand years to enable them to reach Bourdeaux; and, from their\r\npresent extent, it must have been somewhat more than four thousand\r\nyears since they began to be formed[107].\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming of the cultivated lands of Egypt, by the sterile\r\nlands of Libya, which are thrown upon them by the west wind, is\r\na phenomenon of the same nature with the downs. These sands have\r\ndestroyed a number of cities and villages, whose ruins are still to\r\nbe seen; and this has happened since the conquest of the country\r\nby the Mahometans, for the summits of the minarets of some mosques\r\nare seen projecting beyond the sand[108]. With a progress so rapid,\r\nthey would, without doubt, have filled up the narrow parts of the\r\nvalley, if so many ages had elapsed since they began to be thrown\r\ninto it[109]; and there would no longer remain any thing between\r\nthe Libyan chain and the Nile. Here, then, we have another natural\r\nchronometer, of which it would be as easy as interesting to obtain\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peat-Mosses and Slips._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turbaries, or peat-mosses, which have been found so generally\r\nin the northern parts of Europe, by the accumulation of the remains\r\nof _sphagna_ and other aquatic mosses, also afford a measure of\r\ntime. They increase in height in proportions which are determinate\r\nwith regard to each place. They thus envelope the small knolls of\r\nthe lands on which they are formed; and several of these knolls have\r\nbeen covered over within the memory of man. In other places the\r\npeat-mosses descend along the valleys, advancing like glaciers, but\r\ndiffering from them in this respect, that, while the glaciers melt\r\nat their lower part, the progress of the peat is impeded by nothing.\r\nBy sounding their depth down to the solid ground, we may estimate\r\ntheir age; and we find, with regard to these peat-mosses, as with\r\nregard to the downs, that they cannot have derived their origin from\r\nan indefinitely remote period. The same observation may be made with\r\nregard to the slips or fallings, which take place with wonderful\r\nrapidity at the foot of all steep rocks, and which are still very far\r\nfrom having covered them. But as no precise measures have hitherto\r\nbeen applied to these two agents, we shall not insist upon them at\r\ngreater length[110].\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, it may be seen that nature uniformly\r\nspeaks the same language, everywhere informing us that the present\r\norder of things cannot have commenced at a very remote period. And,\r\nwhat is very remarkable, mankind everywhere speaks as nature, whether\r\nwe consult the received traditions of the various nations, or examine\r\ntheir moral and political state, and the intellectual attainments\r\nwhich they had made at the period when their authentic records\r\ncommence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The History of Nations confirms the Newness of the Continents._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, although, at the first glance, the traditions of some\r\nancient nations, which extend their origin to so many thousands\r\nof ages, appear strongly to contradict this newness of the world,\r\nas it exists at present; yet when we examine these traditions\r\nmore carefully, we soon perceive that they are not sufficiently\r\nauthenticated. We are, on the contrary, quickly convinced, that true\r\nhistory, deserving that name, and all that has been preserved of\r\npositive documents regarding the first establishment of nations,\r\nconfirm what has been announced by the natural monuments already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe chronology of none of the western nations can be traced in a\r\ncontinuous line farther back than 3000 years. None of them afford us,\r\nprevious to that period, nor even two or three centuries after, a\r\nseries of facts connected with any degree of probability. The north\r\nof Europe possesses no authentic records which bear a remoter date\r\nthan that of its conversion to Christianity. The history of Spain,\r\nof Gaul, and of England, commences only at the period when these\r\ncountries were conquered by the Romans; that of northern Italy is,\r\nat the present day, almost unknown. The Greeks acknowledge that they\r\ndid not possess the art of writing, until it was taught them by the\r\nPhœnicians, fifteen or sixteen centuries before the Christian era;\r\neven for a long time after, their history is full of fables; and they\r\ndo not assign a more remote date than 300 years farther back, to\r\ntheir uniting into distinct tribes. Of the history of Western Asia,\r\nwe have only a few contradictory extracts, which do not, with any\r\nconnection, give a greater antiquity than twenty-five centuries[111];\r\nand even if we admit the few historical details which refer to more\r\nremote periods, it can scarcely be extended to forty[112].\r\n\r\n_Herodotus_, the first profane historian whose works have been\r\ntransmitted to us, has not a greater antiquity than 2300 years[113].\r\nThe historians, prior to him, whom he may have consulted, do not\r\ndate a century before him[114]. We may even judge of what they were\r\nby the extravagances handed down to us, extracted from the works\r\nof _Aristæus_ of Proconnesus, and some others. Before them we have\r\nonly poets; and _Homer_, the most ancient that we possess, Homer\r\nthe immortal master and model of all the West, flourished only\r\ntwenty-seven or twenty-eight centuries before the present time.\r\n\r\nWhen these first historians speak of ancient events, whether\r\noccurring in their own nation, or in neighbouring countries, they\r\nonly cite oral traditions, and not public works. It was not until\r\na long time after them, that pretended extracts were given from the\r\nEgyptian, Phenician, and Babylonian annals. _Berosus_ wrote only in\r\nthe reign of Seleucus Nicanor; _Hieronymus_ in that of Antiochus\r\nSoter, and _Manetho_ under Ptolemy Philadelphia; the whole three\r\nhaving flourished only in the third century before the Christian era.\r\nThat _Sanconiatho_ was an author real or supposed, was not known\r\ntill Philo of Byblos had published a translation of his work in the\r\nreign of Adrian, in the second century before Christ; and, when he\r\ndid become known, there was nothing found in his account of the early\r\nages, as in those of all the authors of this kind, but a puerile\r\ntheogony, or metaphysical doctrines, so disguised under the form of\r\nallegory as to be unintelligible.\r\n\r\nOne nation alone has preserved annals written in prose before the\r\nperiod of Cyrus, namely, the Jewish people. The part of the Old\r\nTestament which is known by the name of the _Pentateuch_, has existed\r\nin its present form, at least since the separation of the ten tribes\r\nunder Jeroboam, since it was received as authentic by the Samaritans\r\nequally as the Jews, which assures us that its actual antiquity is\r\nupwards of 2800 years. Besides this, we have no reason to doubt the\r\nbook of Genesis having been composed by Moses himself, which gives\r\nit an antiquity of 500 years more, or of thirty-three centuries;\r\nand it is only necessary to read it, to perceive that it has in part\r\nbeen composed of fragments of previously existing works. We cannot,\r\ntherefore, hesitate to admit, that this is the most ancient writing\r\nwhich has been transmitted to modern times in the West[115].\r\n\r\nNow, this work, and all those which have been composed since,\r\nwhatever strangers their authors might be to Moses and his people,\r\nspeak of the nations on the shores of the Mediterranean as of recent\r\norigin; they represent them as still in a half savage state some\r\nages before. And, further, they all speak of a general catastrophe,\r\nan irruption of the waters, which occasioned an almost total\r\nregeneration of the human race; and to this epoch they do not assign\r\na very remote antiquity. Those texts of the Pentateuch, which extend\r\nthis epoch the longest, do not place it farther back than twenty\r\ncenturies before Moses, and hence not more than 5400 years before the\r\npresent day[116].\r\n\r\nIn the poetical traditions of the Greeks, from which is derived\r\nthe whole of our profane history with reference to those remote\r\nages, there is nothing which contradicts the Jewish annals. On the\r\ncontrary, they have a wonderful agreement with them, by the epoch\r\nwhich they assign to the Egyptian and Phenician colonies, by which\r\nthe first germs of civilization were carried into Greece. We find\r\nthat, about the same period when the Israelites took their departure\r\nfrom Egypt, to carry into Palestine the sublime doctrine of the unity\r\nof God, other colonies issued from the same country, to carry into\r\nGreece a religion less pure, at least in its external character,\r\nwhatever might have been the secret doctrines which it reserved for\r\nthe initiated; while others, again, came from Phenicia, and imparted\r\nto the Greeks the art of writing, and whatever was connected with\r\nnavigation and commerce[117].\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly far from being the case, that we have had since\r\nthat time a connected history, since we still find, for a long\r\nperiod after these founders of colonies, a multitude of mythological\r\nevents, and adventures, in which gods and heroes are concerned; and\r\nthese chiefs are connected with authentic history only by means of\r\ngenealogies evidently fictitious[118]. And, it is still more certain,\r\nthat whatever preceded their arrival, could only have been preserved\r\nin very imperfect traditions, and supplied by mere fictions, similar\r\nto those of our monks of the middle age regarding the origin of the\r\nEuropean nations.\r\n\r\nThus, not only should we not be surprised to find, even in ancient\r\ntimes, many doubts and contradictions respecting the epochs of\r\nCecrops, Deucalion, Cadmus and Danaus; and not only would it be\r\nchildish to attach the smallest importance to any opinion whatever,\r\nregarding the precise dates of Inachus[119] or Ogyges[120]; but, if\r\nany thing ought to surprise us, it is this,--that an infinitely more\r\nremote antiquity had not been assigned to those personages. It is\r\nimpossible that there has not been in this case some effect of the\r\ninfluence of received traditions, from which the inventors of fables\r\nwere not able to free themselves. One of the dates assigned to the\r\ndeluge of Ogyges, even agrees so much with one of those which have\r\nbeen attributed to the deluge of Noah, that it is almost impossible\r\nit should not have been derived from some source, where this latter\r\ndeluge had been the one intended to be spoken of[121].\r\n\r\nAs to Deucalion, whether this prince be regarded as a real or\r\nfictitious personage, however little we enter into the manner in\r\nwhich his deluge has been introduced into the poems of the Greeks,\r\nand the various details with which it becomes successively enriched,\r\nwe perceive that it was nothing else than a tradition of the great\r\ncataclysm, altered and placed by the Hellenians in the period which\r\nthey also assigned to Deucalion, because he was regarded as the\r\nfounder of their nation, and because his history is confounded with\r\nthat of all the chiefs of the renewed nations[122].\r\n\r\nEach of the different colonies of Greece, that had preserved\r\nisolated traditions, commenced them with a particular deluge of\r\nits own, because some remembrance of the general deluge common to\r\nall the nations, was preserved among each of the tribes; and, when\r\nit was afterwards attempted to reduce these various traditions to\r\na common chronology, different events were imagined to have been\r\nrecorded, from the circumstance that dates, in reality uncertain, or\r\nperhaps altogether false, although considered as authentic in the\r\ncountries where they originated, were not found to agree with each\r\nother. Thus, in the same manner that the Hellenes had a deluge of\r\nDeucalion, because they regarded him as the founder of their nation,\r\nthe Autochtones of Attica had one of Ogyges, because it was with him\r\nthat their history commenced. The Pelasgi of Arcadia had that which,\r\naccording to later authors, compelled Dardanus to retire towards\r\nthe Hellespont.[123] The island of Samothracia, one of those in\r\nwhich a succession of priests had been more anciently established,\r\ntogether with a regular worship and connected traditions, had also\r\na deluge, which passed for the most ancient of all[124], and which\r\nwas attributed to the bursting of the Bosphorus and the Hellespont.\r\nSome idea of a similar event was preserved in Asia Minor[125], and in\r\nSyria[126], and to this the Greeks would afterwards naturally attach\r\nthe name of Deucalion[127].\r\n\r\nBut none of these traditions assign a very remote antiquity to\r\nthis cataclysm; and there is none of them that does not admit of\r\nexplanation, in so far as its date and other circumstances are\r\nconcerned, from the variations to which narratives, that are not\r\nfixed by writing, must be continually liable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The very remote Antiquity attributed to certain Nations is not\r\nsupported by History._\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who would attribute to the continents and the establishment\r\nof nations, a very remote antiquity, are therefore obliged to have\r\nrecourse to the Indians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians, three nations,\r\nin fact, which appear to have been the most anciently civilized of\r\nthe Caucasian Race, and having a remarkable similarity, not only in\r\ntheir temperament, and in the climate and nature of the countries\r\nwhich they occupied, but also in their political and religious\r\nconstitution, but whose testimony this almost identical constitution\r\nought to render equally suspected[128].\r\n\r\nThese three nations agreed in having each a hereditary caste, to\r\nwhich the care of religion, laws, and science, was exclusively\r\nconsigned. In all of them, this caste had its allegorical language\r\nand secret doctrines; and in all it reserved to itself the privilege\r\nof reading and explaining the sacred books, the whole doctrines of\r\nwhich had been revealed by the gods themselves.\r\n\r\nWe can easily conceive what history would necessarily come to in such\r\nhands; but, without having recourse to any great efforts of reason,\r\nwe may learn it from the fact itself, by examining what it has come\r\nto in the only one of these three nations which still exists,\r\nnamely, the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that history does not exist at all among them. In the\r\nmidst of that infinity of books on mystical theology and abstract\r\nmetaphysics which the Brahmins possess, and many of which have been\r\nmade known to us by the ingenious perseverance of the English, we\r\nfind no connected account of the origin of their nation, or of the\r\nvicissitudes of their society. They even pretend that their religion\r\nprohibits them from recording the events of the present time, their\r\nage of misfortune[129].\r\n\r\nAccording to the Vedas, the first revealed works, on which are\r\nfounded the whole religious opinions of the Hindoos, the literature\r\nof this people, like that of the Greeks, had its origin at two\r\ngreat epochs; the Ramaian and the Mahabarat,--a thousand times\r\nmore monstrous in their wonders than the Iliad and Odyssey, but\r\nin which we also perceive some traces of a metaphysical doctrine\r\nof that description generally termed sublime. The other poems,\r\nwhich, together with the two mentioned, compose the great body of\r\nthe Pouranas, are nothing else than metrical legends or romances,\r\nwritten at different periods, and by different authors, and not\r\nless extravagant in their fictions than the great poems. It has been\r\nimagined that, in some of these writings, events and names of men\r\nbearing some resemblance to those spoken of by the Greeks and Latins,\r\nmight be discovered; and it is chiefly from these resemblances of\r\nnames that Mr Wilfort has attempted to extract from the Pouranas\r\na kind of concordance with our ancient chronology of the west; a\r\nconcordance which, in every line, betrays the hypothetical nature of\r\nits basis, and which, moreover, can only be admitted by absolutely\r\nrejecting the dates given in the Pouranas themselves[130].\r\n\r\nThe list of kings which the Indian pundits or doctors pretend to have\r\ncompiled according to these Pouranas, are nothing but mere catalogues\r\nwithout any details, or adorned with absurd ones, like those of the\r\nChaldeans and Egyptians, and like those which Trithemus and Saxo\r\nGrammaticus have made up for the northern nations[131]. These lists\r\nare far from corresponding; none of them supposes a history, or\r\nregisters, or records; the very basis on which they rest may have\r\nbeen purely imagined by the poets from whose works they have been\r\nextracted. One of the pundits who furnished Mr Wilfort with them,\r\nacknowledged that he had arbitrarily filled up the spaces between\r\nthe celebrated kings with imaginary names[132], and avowed that his\r\npredecessors had done the same. If this be true of the lists obtained\r\nby the English at the present day, how should it not be so of those\r\ngiven by Abou-Fazel, as extracts from the annals of Cachmere[133],\r\nand which, besides, full of fables as they are, do not extend farther\r\nback than 4300 years, of which more than 1200 are occupied with names\r\nof princes whose reigns, in as far as regards their duration, remain\r\nundetermined.\r\n\r\nEven the era, accordingly, from which the Indians count their years\r\nat the present day, which commences fifty-seven years before Christ,\r\nand which bears the name of a prince called _Vicramaditjia_, or\r\n_Bickermadjit_, bears it only by a sort of convention; for we find,\r\naccording to the synchronisms attributed to Vicramaditjia, that there\r\nmay have been at least three, and perhaps so many as eight or nine,\r\nprinces of this name, who have all similar legends, and who have all\r\nwaged war with a prince named _Saliwahanna_; and, further, we cannot\r\nwell make out whether this period, the fifty-seventh year before the\r\nChristian era, is that of the birth, reign, or death of the hero\r\nwhose name it bears.[134]\r\n\r\nLastly, the most authentic books of the Indians, contradict, by\r\nintrinsic and very obvious characters, the antiquity attributed to\r\nthem by the pundits. Their _vedas_, or sacred books, alleged by\r\nthem to have been revealed by Brama himself from the beginning of\r\nthe world, and arranged by _Viasa_ (a name which signifies nothing\r\nelse than collector), at the commencement of the present age, if we\r\njudge of them by the calendar which is found annexed, and to which\r\nthey refer, as well as by the position of the colures indicated by\r\nthis calendar, may extend to 3200 years, or about the epoch of\r\nMoses.[135] Nay, perhaps those who give credit to the assertion of\r\nMegasthenes[136], that in his time the Indians were not acquainted\r\nwith the art of writing, who reflect that none of the ancients\r\nhas made mention of their superb temples, those immense pagodas,\r\nthe remarkable monuments of the religion of the Brahmins, and who\r\nare aware that the epochs of their astronomical tables have been\r\ncalculated backwards, and ill calculated, and that their treatises of\r\nastronomy are modern and antedated, will be inclined still farther to\r\nreduce the pretended antiquity of the Vedas.\r\n\r\nYet even in the midst of all the Brahminical fictions, circumstances\r\noccur, whose agreement with the result of the historical monuments of\r\nmore western countries cannot but astonish us. Thus, their mythology\r\nconsecrates the successive devastations which the surface of the\r\nglobe has already undergone, or is yet destined to undergo; and it\r\nis only to a period somewhat less than 5000 years, that they refer\r\nthe last catastrophe.[137] One of these revolutions, which is in\r\nreality placed much farther from us, is described in terms nearly\r\ncorresponding with those of Moses[138]. Mr Wilfort even assures us,\r\nthat, in another event of the same mythology, a conspicuous place is\r\nheld by a personage who resembles Deucalion, in his origin, name, and\r\nadventures, and even in the name and adventures of his father[139].\r\nIt is a circumstance equally worthy of remark, that, in the lists\r\nof their kings, imperfect and unauthentic as they are, they date the\r\ncommencement of their first human sovereigns (those of the race of\r\nthe sun and moon), at an epoch which is nearly the same as that from\r\nwhich Ctesias, in his singularly constructed list, commences the\r\nreign of his Assyrian kings[140].\r\n\r\nThis deplorable state of historical knowledge was necessarily\r\nthe result of the system of a people, among whom the exclusive\r\nprivilege of writing, of preserving, and of explaining the books,\r\nwas given to the hereditary priests of a religion monstrous in\r\nits ritual, and cruel in its maxims. Some legend made up for the\r\npurpose of establishing a place of pilgrimage, inventions adapted\r\nto impress more deeply a respect for their caste, must have\r\ninterested these priests more than any historical truths. Of the\r\nsciences, they might have cultivated astronomy, which would give\r\nthem credit as astrologers; mechanics, which would assist them in\r\nraising their monuments, those signs of their power, and objects of\r\nthe superstitious veneration of the people; geometry, the basis of\r\nastronomy, as well as of mechanics, and an important auxiliary to\r\nagriculture in those vast plains of alluvial formation, which could\r\nonly be rendered healthy and fertile by the aid of numerous canals.\r\nThey might have encouraged the mechanical or chemical arts, which\r\nsupported their commerce, and contributed to their luxury, and the\r\nmagnificence of their temples. But history, which informs men of\r\ntheir mutual relations, would be regarded by them with dread.\r\n\r\nWhat we see in India, we might therefore expect to find in general,\r\nwherever sacerdotal races, constituted like those of the Brahmins,\r\nand established in similar countries, assumed the same empire over\r\nthe mass of the people. The same causes produce the same effects;\r\nand, in fact, we have only to glance over the fragments of Egyptian\r\nand Chaldean traditions which have been preserved, to be convinced\r\nthat there is no more historical authenticity in them than in those\r\nof the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn order to judge of the nature of the chronicles which the Egyptian\r\npriests pretended to possess, it is only necessary to review the\r\nextracts which have been given by themselves at different periods,\r\nand to different individuals.\r\n\r\nThose of _Sais_, for example, informed Solon, about 550 years before\r\nChrist, that, as Egypt was not subject to deluges, they had preserved\r\nnot only their own annals, but those of other nations also; that the\r\ncities of Athens and Sais had been built by Minerva, the former 9000\r\nyears before, the latter only 8000; and to these dates they added\r\nthe well known fables respecting the Atlantes, and the resistance\r\nwhich the ancient Athenians opposed to their conquests, together with\r\nthe whole romantic description of the Atlantis[141], a description\r\nin which we find events and genealogies similar to those of all\r\nmythological romances.\r\n\r\nA century later, about 450 years before Christ, the priests of\r\nMemphis gave entirely different accounts to Herodotus[142]. Menes,\r\nthe first king of Egypt, according to them, had built Memphis, and\r\ninclosed the Nile within dikes, as if it were possible that the first\r\nking of a country could perform operations of this kind. Between\r\nthis prince and Mœris, who, according to them, reigned 900 years\r\nbefore the period at which this account was given (1350 years before\r\nChrist), they had a succession of three hundred and thirty other\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nAfter these kings came Sesostris, who extended his conquests as far\r\nas Colchis[143]; and altogether, there were, to the time of Sethos,\r\nthree hundred and forty-one kings, and three hundred and forty-one\r\nchief priests, in three hundred and forty-one generations, during a\r\nspace of 11,340 years. And, in this interval, as if to insure the\r\nauthenticity of their chronology, these priests asserted that the\r\nsun had risen twice where he sets, without any change having taken\r\nplace in the climate or productions of the country, and without any\r\nof the gods having at that time, or before, made their appearance and\r\nreigned in Egypt.\r\n\r\nTo this fable, which, despite of all the pretended explanations that\r\nhave been given of it, evinces so gross an ignorance of astronomy,\r\nthey added, regarding Sesostris, Phero, Helenius, and Rhampsinitus,\r\nthe kings who built the pyramids, and an Ethiopian conqueror named\r\n_Sabacos_, a set of tales equally absurd.\r\n\r\nThe priests of Thebes did better: they shewed Herodotus, and they\r\nhad before shewn to Hecatæus, three hundred and forty-five colossal\r\nfigures of wood, which represented three hundred and forty-five high\r\npriests, who had succeeded to each other from father to son, all\r\nmen, all born the one of the other, but who had been preceded by\r\ngods[144]. Other Egyptians told him that they had exact registers,\r\nnot only of the reign of men, but also of that of gods. They reckoned\r\n17,000 years from Hercules to Amases, and 15,000 from Bacchus. Pan\r\nhad even been prior to Hercules[145]. These people evidently took for\r\nhistory some allegories relating to pantheistic metaphysics, which\r\nformed, unknown to them, the basis of their mythology.\r\n\r\nIt is only from the time of Sethos that Herodotus commences the\r\npart of his history which is somewhat rational; and it is worthy of\r\nremark, that this part begins with an event which agrees with the\r\nHebrew annals, the destruction of the army of the King of Assyria,\r\n_Sennacherib_[146]; and this agreement continues under Necho[147],\r\nand under Hophra or Apries.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries after Herodotus (about 260 years before Christ)\r\nPtolemy Philadelphus, a prince of a foreign race, wished to become\r\nacquainted with the history of the country which events had called\r\nhim to govern. A priest, called Manetho, was employed to write it\r\nfor him. It was not from registers or archives that he pretended to\r\ncompile this work, but from the sacred books of Agathodæmon, the son\r\nof the second Hermes, and the father of Tat, who had copied it upon\r\npillars erected before the flood by Tot or the first Hermes, in the\r\nSeriadic land[148]. And this second Hermes, this Agathodæmon, this\r\nTat, are personages of whom nothing had ever been said before, any\r\nmore than of the Seriadic land, or of its pillars. The deluge itself\r\nwas an event entirely unknown to the Egyptians of preceding times,\r\nand concerning which Manetho says nothing in what remains of his\r\ndynasties. The product resembles its source; not only is the whole\r\nfull of absurdities, but they are absurdities peculiar to the work,\r\nand utterly irreconcilable with those which the priests of older\r\ntimes had related to Solon and Herodotus.\r\n\r\nIt is Vulcan who commences the series of divine kings. He reigns\r\n9000 years; the gods and demi-gods reign 1985 years. The names, and\r\nsuccessions, and dates of Manetho are utterly unlike any thing that\r\nwas published before or after him; and from the discrepancy of the\r\nextracts given by Josephus, Julius Africanus, and Eusebius, we may\r\ninfer that his narratives were as obscure and confused in themselves,\r\nas they were discordant with those of other authors. Even the\r\nduration of the respective reigns of his human kings is not settled.\r\nAccording to Julius Africanus, it extended to 5101; according to\r\nEusebius, to 4723; and according to Syncellus, to 3555 years. It\r\nmight be thought that the differences in the names and cyphers arose\r\nfrom the inaccuracy of copyists; but Josephus quotes a passage at\r\nlength, the details of which are manifestly in contradiction with the\r\nextracts of his successors.\r\n\r\nA chronicle, named the _ancient_[149], and which some consider\r\nanterior, others posterior, to Manetho, gives still different\r\ncalculations. The total duration of its kings is 36,525 years, of\r\nwhich the sun reigned 30,000, the other gods 3984, and the demi-gods\r\n217; there remaining for those of the human race only 2339 years.\r\nThere are thus also but 113 generations, in place of the 340 of\r\nHerodotus.\r\n\r\nA learned man of an order different from that of Manetho, the\r\nastronomer Eratosthenes, discovered and published, in the reign\r\nof Ptolemy Euergetes, about 240 years before Christ, a particular\r\nlist of thirty-eight kings of Thebes, commencing with Menes, and\r\ncontinuing for a space of 1024 years; of which we have an extract\r\nthat Syncellus has copied from Apollodorus[150]. Scarcely any of the\r\nnames found in this list correspond with those of the others.\r\n\r\nDiodorus went to Egypt in the reign of Ptolemy Auletes, about sixty\r\nyears before Christ, consequently two centuries after Manetho, and\r\nfour after Herodotus. He also collected from the narratives of the\r\npriests a history of the country, and his account is again quite\r\ndifferent from those of his predecessors[151]. It is no longer\r\nMenes who built Memphis, but Uchoræus; and long before his time\r\nBusiris the second had built Thebes. The eighth ancestor of Uchoræus,\r\nOsymandyas, possessed himself of Bactria, and crushed rebellions in\r\nit. Long after him, Sesoosis made still more extensive conquests,\r\nhaving proceeded as far as the Ganges, and returned by Scythia and\r\nthe Tanais. Unfortunately these names of kings are unknown to all the\r\npreceding historians, and none of the nations which they conquered\r\nhave preserved the slightest traces of them. As to the gods and\r\nheroes, their reign, according to Diodorus, extended through a space\r\nof 18,000 years, while that of the human sovereigns was 15,000. Four\r\nhundred and seventy of the kings were Egyptians, and four Ethiopians,\r\nwithout reckoning the Persians and Macedonians. The fables, besides,\r\nwith which the whole is intermingled, do not yield in childishness to\r\nthose of Herodotus.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth year of the Christian era, Germanicus, the nephew\r\nof Tiberius, led by the desire of becoming acquainted with the\r\nantiquities of this celebrated land, went over to Egypt, at the\r\nrisk of incurring the displeasure of a prince so suspicious as his\r\nuncle, and proceeded up the Nile as far as Thebes. It was no more\r\nSesostris or Osymandyas, of whom the priests spoke to him as a\r\nconqueror, but Rhamses, who, at the head of 700,000 men, had invaded\r\nLibya, Ethiopia, Media, Persia, Bactria, Scythia, Asia-Minor, and\r\nSyria[152].\r\n\r\nLastly, in the celebrated article of Pliny upon the obelisks[153],\r\nwe find names of kings which are not to be seen elsewhere; Sothies,\r\nMnevis, Zmarreus, Eraphius, Mestires, a Semenpserteus, contemporary\r\nof Pythagoras, &c. A Ramises, who might be thought the same as\r\nRhamses, is there made to live at the time of the siege of Troy.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether it has been attempted to reconcile these\r\ndiscordant lists by the supposition that the kings have borne several\r\nnames. For my own part, when I consider not only the discrepancy of\r\nthese various accounts, but, above all, the mixture of authentic\r\nfacts, attested by vast monuments, and of puerile extravagancies,\r\nit appears to me much more natural to conclude, that the Egyptian\r\npriests possessed no real history whatever; that, inferior still to\r\nthose of India, they had not even suitable and connected fables;\r\nthat they preserved only lists more or less defective of their kings,\r\nand some remembrances of the more distinguished among them, of those\r\nespecially who had taken care to have their names inscribed upon the\r\ntemples and other great edifices which adorned their country; but\r\nthat these remembrances were confused, that they rested merely upon\r\nthe traditional explanation which was given to the representations\r\npainted or sculptured upon the monuments; explanations founded\r\nsolely upon hieroglyphical inscriptions, conceived, like that which\r\nhas been handed down to us[154], in very general terms, and which,\r\npassing from mouth to mouth, were altered, as to their details, at\r\nthe pleasure of those who communicated them to strangers; and that it\r\nis consequently impossible to rest any proposition relative to the\r\nantiquity of the presently existing continents, upon the shreds of\r\nthese traditions, so incomplete even in their own times, and become\r\nutterly unintelligible under the pen of those who have been the means\r\nof transmitting them to us.\r\n\r\nShould this assertion require other proofs, they would be found\r\nin the list of the sacred works of Hermes, which were carried\r\nby the Egyptian priests in their solemn processions. Clement of\r\nAlexandria[155] names them all to the number of forty-two, and there\r\nis not even found among them, as is the case with the Brahmins, one\r\nepic poem, or one book, which has the pretension to be a narrative,\r\nor to fix in any way a single great action or a single event.\r\n\r\nThe interesting researches of M. Champollion the younger, and\r\nhis astonishing discoveries regarding the language of the\r\nhieroglyphics[156], far from overturning these conjectures, on the\r\ncontrary, confirm them. This ingenious antiquary has read, in a\r\nseries of hieroglyphic paintings in the temple of Abydos[157], the\r\nprenomens of a certain number of kings placed in regular succession\r\none after another; and a part of these prenomens (the last ten)\r\nrecurring on various other monuments, accompanied with proper names,\r\nhe has concluded that they are those of kings who bore those proper\r\nnames, and this has afforded him nearly the same kings, and in\r\nthe same order, as those of which Manetho composes his eighteenth\r\ndynasty, that which expelled the shepherds. The concordance, however,\r\nis not complete: in the painting of Abydos, six of the names that\r\nappear in Manetho’s list are wanting; there are some, again, which\r\nbear no resemblance; and, lastly, there unfortunately occurs a\r\nblank before the most remarkable of all, the Rhamses, who appears\r\nthe same as the king represented on many of the finest monuments,\r\nwith the attributes of a great conqueror. It would be, according\r\nto M. Champollion, in the list of Manetho, the Sethos, the chief\r\nof the nineteenth dynasty, who, in fact, is indicated as powerful\r\nin ships and in cavalry, and as having carried his arms into\r\nCyprus, Media and Persia. M. Champollion thinks, with Marsham and\r\nmany others, that it is this Rhamses, or this Sethos, who is the\r\nSesostris, or the Sesoosis of the Greeks; and this opinion possesses\r\nsome probability, in this respect, that the representations of the\r\nvictories of Rhamses, probably carried over the wandering tribes in\r\nthe vicinity of Egypt, or at the most into Syria, have given rise\r\nto those fabulous ideas of vast conquests attributed, by some other\r\nconfusion, to a Sesostris. But, in Manetho, it is in the twelfth\r\ndynasty, and not in the eighteenth, that a prince bearing the name\r\nof Sesostris is inscribed, who is noted as having conquered Asia\r\nand Thrace[158]. Marsham also asserts, that this twelfth dynasty\r\nand the eighteenth make but one[159]. Manetho could not himself,\r\ntherefore, have understood the lists which he copied. Lastly, if\r\nwe admit in their full degree, both the historical truth of this\r\nbas-relief of Abydos, and its accordance, whether with the part of\r\nManetho’s lists that seems to correspond to it, or with the other\r\nhieroglyphic inscriptions, this consequence would result, that the\r\npretended eighteenth dynasty, the first regarding which the ancient\r\nchronologists begin to manifest some agreement, is also the first\r\nwhich has left traces of its existence upon monuments. Manetho may\r\nhave consulted this document and others of a like nature; but it\r\nis not the less obvious, that a mere list, a series of names or of\r\nportraits, as he has throughout, is far from being a history.\r\n\r\nOught not this, then, which is proved and demonstrated with respect\r\nto the Indians, and which I have rendered so probable with respect\r\nto the inhabitants of the valley of the Nile, be presumed also to\r\nbe the case with those of the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris?\r\nEstablished, like the Indians[160] and Egyptians, upon a much\r\nfrequented route of commerce, in vast plains, which they had been\r\nobliged to intersect with numerous canals; instructed, like them,\r\nby hereditary priests, the pretended depositaries of secret books,\r\nthe privileged possessors of the sciences, astrologers, builders\r\nof pyramids, and other great monuments[161]; should they not also\r\nresemble them in other essential points? Should not their history\r\nbe equally a mere collection of legendary tales? I venture almost\r\nto assert, that not only is this probable, but that it is actually\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nUp to this period neither Moses nor Homer speak of any great empire\r\nin Upper Asia. Herodotus[162] gives to the supremacy of the Assyrians\r\na duration of only 520 years, and does not attribute to their origin\r\na greater antiquity than about eight centuries before his own time.\r\nAfter having been at Babylon, where he consulted the priests, he had\r\nnot even learnt the name of Ninus as king of the Assyrians, and does\r\nnot mention him otherwise than as the father of Agro[163], the first\r\nLydian king of the family of the Heraclides. Notwithstanding, he\r\nmakes him the son of Belus: so much confusion had there been in the\r\ntraditions. Though he speaks of Semiramis as one of the queens who\r\nleft great monuments in Babylon, he only places her seven generations\r\nbefore Cyrus.\r\n\r\nHellanicus, who was cotemporary with Herodotus, far from allowing\r\nthat Semiramis had built any thing at Babylon, attributes the\r\nfoundation of that city to Chaldæus, the fourteenth successor\r\nof Ninus[164]. Berosus, a Babylonian and a priest, who wrote\r\nscarcely a hundred and twenty years after Herodotus, gives an\r\nastounding antiquity to Babylon; but it is to Nabuchodonosor, a\r\nprince comparatively very modern, that he attributes the principal\r\nmonuments[165]. Regarding even Cyrus, a prince so remarkable, and\r\nwhose history must have been so well known and so popular, Herodotus,\r\nwho only lived a hundred years after him, owns that, in his time,\r\nthere already existed three different opinions; and, in fact, sixty\r\nyears later, Xenophon gives a biography of this prince quite at\r\nvariance with that of Herodotus.\r\n\r\nCtesias, who was nearly cotemporary with Xenophon, pretends to have\r\nextracted from the royal archives of the Medes, a chronology which\r\ncarries back the origin of the Assyrian monarchy upwards of 800\r\nyears, putting at the head of their kings, that same Ninus, the son\r\nof Belus, whom Herodotus had made one of the Heraclides; and, at the\r\nsame time, he attributes to Ninus and Semiramis conquests towards\r\nthe west, of an extent absolutely incompatible with the Jewish and\r\nEgyptian history of the times in question[166].\r\n\r\nAccording to Megasthenes, it was Nabuchodonosor who made these\r\nincredible conquests. He pushed them by way of Libya, as far as\r\nSpain[167]. We find that, in the time of Alexander, Nabuchodonosor\r\nhad completely usurped the reputation which Semiramis had possessed\r\nin the time of Artaxerxes. But we must suppose, without doubt, that\r\nSemiramis and Nabuchodonosor had conquered Ethiopia and Libya, much\r\nin the same way as the Egyptians made India and Bactria to be subdued\r\nby Sesostris or Osymandias.\r\n\r\nIt would lead to no result were we now to examine the different\r\naccounts respecting Sardanapalus, in which a celebrated writer\r\nimagined he had found proofs of the existence of three princes of\r\nthat name, who were all victims of similar misfortunes[168]; much in\r\nthe same way as another writer found in the Indian Vicramaditjia,\r\nat least three princes, who were equally the heroes of similar\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nIt is apparently from the want of agreement in all these accounts,\r\nthat Strabo thought himself justified in saying, that the authority\r\nof Herodotus and Ctesias was not equal to that of Homer or\r\nHesiod[169]. Nor has Ctesias been more happy in transcribers than\r\nManetho; and it is very difficult, at the present day, to harmonize\r\nthe extracts made from his writings by Diodorus, Eusebius, and the\r\nSyncelle.\r\n\r\nSince there existed such a state of uncertainty in the fifth century\r\nbefore the Christian era, how should it be imagined that Berosus had\r\nbeen able to clear it up in the third century before that era; or how\r\nshould we repose more confidence in the 430,000 years which he puts\r\nbefore the deluge, or the 35,000 years which he places between the\r\ndeluge and Semiramis, than in the registers of 150,000 years, which\r\nhe boasts of having consulted[170].\r\n\r\nStructures raised in remote provinces, and bearing the name of\r\nSemiramis, have been spoken of; and columns erected by Sesostris[171]\r\nhave been pretended to have been seen in Asia Minor, in Thrace.\r\nBut, in the same way, in Persia, at the present day, the ancient\r\nmonuments, perhaps even some of the above, bear the name of Roustan;\r\nand in Egypt or Arabia, they bear the names of Joseph or Solomon.\r\nThis is an ancient custom among the eastern nations, and probably\r\namong all ignorant people. The peasants of our own country give the\r\nname of Cæsar’s Camp to all the remains of Roman entrenchments.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the more I consider the subject, the more I am persuaded\r\nthat there existed no ancient history at Babylon or Ecbatan, more\r\nthan in Egypt and India. And, in place of reducing mythology to\r\nhistory, with Evhemere and Bannier, I am of opinion that a great part\r\nof history should be referred to mythology.\r\n\r\nIt is only at the epoch of what is commonly called the Second Kingdom\r\nof Assyria, that the history of the Assyrians and Chaldeans begins to\r\nbecome more intelligible; and this epoch is also that at which the\r\nhistory of the Egyptians undergoes a similar change, when the kings\r\nof Nineveh, of Babylon, and of Egypt, commence their conflicts on the\r\ntheatre of Syria and Palestine.\r\n\r\nIt appears, nevertheless, that the authors of these countries, or\r\nthose who had consulted the traditions regarding them, Berosus, and\r\nHieronymus, and Nicholas de Damas, agreed in speaking of a deluge.\r\nBerosus has even described it with circumstances so similar to those\r\ndetailed in the book of Genesis, that it is almost impossible what he\r\nsays of it should not have been derived from the same sources, even\r\nalthough he removes its epoch a great number of ages back,--insomuch,\r\nat least, as we may judge of it, by the confused extracts which\r\nJosephus, Eusebius, and Syncellus, have preserved of his writings.\r\nBut we must remark, and with this observation we shall conclude what\r\nwe have to say with regard to the Babylonians, that these numerous\r\nages, and this long series of kings, placed between the deluge and\r\nSemiramis, are a new thing, entirely peculiar to Berosus, and\r\nof which Ctesias, and those who have followed him, had no idea,\r\nand which has not even been adopted by any of the profane authors\r\nposterior to Berosus. Justin and Velleius consider Ninus as the first\r\nof the conquerors, and those who, contrary to all probability, place\r\nhim highest, only refer him to a period of forty centuries before the\r\npresent time[172].\r\n\r\nThe Armenian authors of the middle age nearly agree with one of\r\nthe texts of Genesis, when they refer the deluge to a period of\r\n4916 years from their own time; and it might be thought that\r\nhaving collected the old traditions, and perhaps extracted the old\r\nchronicles of their country, they form an additional authority in\r\nfavour of the newness of the nations. But when we reflect that their\r\nhistorical literature commences only in the fifth century, and that\r\nthey were acquainted with Eusebius, we perceive that they must have\r\naccommodated themselves to his authority, and to that of the Bible.\r\nMoses of Chorene expressly professes to have followed the Greeks, and\r\nwe see that his ancient history is moulded after Ctesias[173].\r\n\r\nHowever, it is certain, that the tradition of the deluge existed\r\nin Armenia long before the conversion of its inhabitants to\r\nChristianity; and the city, which, according to Josephus, was called\r\n_the Place of the Descent_, still exists at the foot of Mount Ararat,\r\nand bears the name of _Nachid-chevan_, which, in fact, has the same\r\nsignification.[174]\r\n\r\nAlong with the Armenians, we include the Arabians, Persians, Turks,\r\nMongolians, and Abyssinians, of the present day. Their ancient\r\nbooks, if they ever had any, no longer exist. They have no ancient\r\nhistory, but that which they have recently made up, and which they\r\nhave modelled after the Bible; hence, what they say of the deluge is\r\nborrowed from Genesis, and adds nothing to the authority of that book.\r\n\r\nIt were curious to inquire what had been the opinion of the ancient\r\nPersians upon this subject, before it was modified by the Christian\r\nand Mahomedan creeds. We find it deposited in their Boundehesh, or\r\nCosmogony, a work of the time of Sassanides, (but evidently extracted\r\nor translated from more ancient works), and which was discovered\r\nby Anquetil du Perron, among the Parsis of India. According to it,\r\nthe total duration of the world could only be 12,000 years; hence\r\nit cannot still be very old. The appearance of _Cayoumortz_ (the\r\nbull-man, the first of the human race), is preceded by the creation\r\nof a great water.[175]\r\n\r\nFor the rest, it would be as useless to expect a regular history of\r\nancient times from the Parsis, as from the other eastern nations. The\r\nMagi have left none, any more than the Brahmins or Chaldeans. Of this\r\nthere is nothing more required for proof than the uncertainty which\r\nexists regarding the epoch of Zoroaster. It is even asserted, that\r\nthe little history they may have possessed, that which relates to the\r\nAchemenides, the successors of Cyrus to Alexander, had been expressly\r\naltered, and this in consequence of an official order to that purpose\r\nfrom a monarch named Sassanides[176].\r\n\r\nIn order to discover authentic dates of the commencement of empires,\r\nand traces of a general deluge, we must therefore go beyond the\r\ngreat deserts of Tartary. Toward the east and north we find another\r\nrace of men, who differ from us as much in their institutions and\r\nmanners as in their form and temperament. Their language consists\r\nof monosyllables, and they make use of arbitrary hieroglyphics in\r\nwriting. They have only a political system of morals, without\r\nreligion; for the superstitions of Fo were imported among them from\r\nIndia. Their yellow skin, their prominent cheeks, their narrow and\r\noblique eyes, and their scanty beard, render them so different from\r\nus, that one is tempted to believe that their ancestors and ours had\r\nescaped the great catastrophe on two different sides. But however\r\nthis may be, the epoch which they assign to their deluge is nearly\r\nthe same as ours.\r\n\r\nThe Chou-king is the most ancient of the Chinese books[177]; it is\r\nsaid to have been compiled by Confucius, about 2255 years ago, from\r\nfragments of more ancient works. Two hundred years afterwards, a\r\ngeneral persecution of the men of letters, and destruction of the\r\nbooks, is said to have taken place under the emperor Chi-Hoang-ti,\r\nwhose object in this was to destroy the traces of the feudal\r\ngovernment established under the dynasty which preceded his. Forty\r\nyears after, under the dynasty which had overturned that to which\r\nChi-Hoang-ti belonged, a portion of the Chou-king was restored from\r\nmemory by an old literatus, and another was discovered in a tomb; but\r\nnearly the half of it was for ever lost. Now, this book, the most\r\nauthentic which the Chinese possess, commences the history of their\r\ncountry with the reign of an emperor named _Yao_, whom it represents\r\nto us as occupied in removing the waters, _which, having risen to\r\nthe skies, still bathed the foot of the higher mountains, covered\r\nthe less elevated hills_, and rendered the plains impassable[178].\r\nAccording to some, the reign of Yao was 4163 years before the present\r\ntime; according to others, 3943. The discrepancy in the opinions\r\nregarding this epoch even amounts to 284 years.\r\n\r\nA few pages farther on we find one _Yu_, a minister and engineer,\r\nre-establishing the courses of the waters, raising embankments,\r\ndigging canals, and regulating the taxes of all the provinces in\r\nChina, that is to say, in an empire extending 600 leagues in all\r\ndirections. But the impossibility of such operations, after such\r\nevents, shews clearly that the whole is nothing else than a moral and\r\npolitical romance[179].\r\n\r\nMore modern Chinese historians have added a series of emperors\r\nbefore Yao, but with a multitude of fabulous circumstances, without\r\nventuring to assign them fixed epochs. These writers are at\r\nperpetual variance with each other, even regarding the number and\r\nnames of their emperors, and are not universally approved by their\r\ncountrymen. Fouhi, with the body of a serpent, the head of an ox, and\r\nthe teeth of a tortoise, together with his successors, who are not\r\nless monstrous, are altogether absurd, and have no more existed than\r\nEnceladon and Briareus.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that mere chance could have produced so striking a\r\nresult, as to make the traditional origin of the Assyrian, Indian,\r\nand Chinese monarchies agree in being referred to an epoch of nearly\r\n4000 years from the present period? Would the ideas of nations which\r\nhave had so little communication with each other, and whose language,\r\nreligion, and laws are altogether different, have corresponded upon\r\nthis point, had they not been founded upon truth?\r\n\r\nWe could not expect precise dates from the natives of America, who\r\nhad no real writings, and whose oldest traditions extended only to\r\na few centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. And yet, even\r\namong them, traces of a deluge are imagined to be found in their rude\r\nhieroglyphics. They have their Noah, or Deucalion, as well as the\r\nIndians, Babylonians, and Greeks[180].\r\n\r\nThe Negroes, the most degraded race among men, whose forms approach\r\nthe nearest to the brutes, and whose intellect has not yet arrived\r\nat the institution of regular governments, or at any thing having\r\nthe least appearance of systematic knowledge, have preserved no\r\nsort of annals or traditions. They cannot, therefore, afford us any\r\ninformation on the subject of our present researches, though all\r\ntheir characters clearly shew us that they have escaped from the\r\ngreat catastrophe, at another point than the Caucasian and Altaic\r\nraces, from which they had perhaps been separated for a long time\r\nprevious to the occurrence of that catastrophe.\r\n\r\nBut if the ancients, it is argued, have left no history, their long\r\nexistence as nations is not the less attested by the advances which\r\nthey have made in astronomy, by observations whose date is easily\r\ndetermined, and even by monuments which still remain, and which\r\nthemselves bear their dates. Thus, the length of the year, such as\r\nthe Egyptians are supposed to have determined it, according to the\r\nheliacal rising of Sirius, proves correct for a period comprised\r\nbetween the year 3000 and the year 1000 before Christ, a period to\r\nwhich the traditions of their conquests and of the great prosperity\r\nof their empire also refer. This accuracy proves to what perfection\r\nthey had carried their observations, and shews that they had for\r\nmany ages applied themselves to such investigations.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the force of this argument, it is necessary\r\nthat we should here enter upon some explanations.\r\n\r\nThe solstice is the moment of the year at which the rise of the\r\nNile commences, and that which the Egyptians must have observed\r\nwith most attention. Having, at the beginning, made, from imperfect\r\nobservations, a civil or sacred year of three hundred and sixty-five\r\ndays complete, they would preserve it from superstitious motives,\r\neven after they had perceived that it did not agree with the natural\r\nor tropical year, and did not bring back the seasons to the same\r\ndays[181]. However, it was this tropical year which it behoved them\r\nto mark for the purpose of directing them in their agricultural\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThey would, therefore, have to search in the heavens for an apparent\r\nsign of its return, and they imagined they had found this sign when\r\nthe sun returned to the same position, relatively to some remarkable\r\nstar. Thus they applied themselves, like almost all nations who\r\nare beginning this inquiry, to observe the heliacal risings and\r\nsettings of the stars. We know that they chose particularly the\r\nheliacal rising of Sirius, at first, doubtless, on account of the\r\nbeauty of the star; and, especially, because, in those ancient times,\r\nthis rising of Sirius being nearly coincident with the solstice,\r\nand indicative of the inundation, was to them the most important\r\nphenomenon of this kind. Hence it was that Sirius, under the name of\r\nSothis, occupied so conspicuous a place in their mythology, and in\r\ntheir religious ceremonies. Supposing, therefore, that the return of\r\nthe heliacal rising of Sirius and the tropical year were of the same\r\nduration, and believing, at length, that this duration was 365 days\r\nand a quarter, they would imagine a period after which the tropical\r\nyear and the old year, the sacred year of 365 days only, would return\r\nto the same day; a period which, according to these incorrect data,\r\nwas necessarily 1461 sacred years, and 1460 of those improved years\r\nto which they gave the name of years of Sirius.\r\n\r\nThey took for the point of departure of this period, which they named\r\nthe Sothiac or great year, a civil year, the first day of which was,\r\nor had been, also that of a heliacal rising of Sirius; and it is\r\nknown, from the positive testimony of Censorinus, that one of these\r\ngreat years had ended in the 138th year of the Christian era[182].\r\nIt had consequently commenced in the 1322d before Christ, and that\r\nwhich preceded it in the 2782d. In fact, the calculations of M.\r\nIdeler shew, that Sirius was heliacally risen on the 20th July of the\r\nJulian year 139, a day which corresponded that year to the first of\r\nThot, or the first day of the Egyptian sacred year[183].\r\n\r\nBut not only is the position of the sun, with relation to the stars\r\nof the ecliptic, or the sidereal year different from the tropical\r\nyear, on account of the precession of the equinoxes. The heliacal\r\nyear of a star, or the period of its heliacal rising, especially when\r\nit is distant from the ecliptic, differs still from the sidereal\r\nyear, and differs in various degrees according to the latitudes of\r\nthe places where it is observed. What is very singular, however,\r\nand the observation has already been made by Bainbridge[184] and\r\nFather Petau[185], it happens, by a remarkable concurrence in the\r\npositions, that, in the latitude of Upper Egypt, at a certain epoch,\r\nand during a certain number of ages, the year of Sirius was really\r\nwithin very little of 365 days and a quarter; so that the heliacal\r\nrising of this star returned in fact to the same day of the Julian\r\nyear, the 20th July, in the year 1322 before, and the year 138 after\r\nChrist[186].\r\n\r\nFrom this actual coincidence, at this remote period, M. Fourier, who\r\nhas confirmed all these accounts by new calculations, concludes,\r\nthat, since the length of the year of Sirius was so perfectly known\r\nto the Egyptians, they must have determined it by observations made\r\nduring a long series of years, and conducted with great accuracy;\r\nobservations which must be referred to at least 2500 years before the\r\npresent time, and which could not have been made long before or long\r\nafter this interval of time[187].\r\n\r\nThis result would assuredly be very striking, had it been directly,\r\nand by observations, made upon Sirius itself, that they had fixed\r\nthe length of the year of Sirius. But experienced astronomers affirm\r\nit to be impossible that the heliacal rising of a star could afford\r\na sufficient foundation for exact observations on such a subject,\r\nespecially in a climate where _the circumference of the horizon\r\nis constantly so much loaded with vapours, that, in clear nights,\r\nstars of the second or third magnitude can never be seen within some\r\ndegrees of the verge of the horizon, and that the sun itself is\r\ncompletely obscured at its rising and setting_.[188] They maintain,\r\nthat, if the length of the year had not been otherwise ascertained,\r\nthere would have been a mistake of one or two days.[189] They have no\r\ndoubt, therefore, that this duration of 365 days and a quarter, is\r\nthat of the tropical year inaccurately determined by the observation\r\nof the shadow, or by that of the point where the sun rose each day,\r\nand through ignorance identified with the heliacal year of Sirius; so\r\nthat it would be mere chance which had fixed with so much accuracy\r\nthe duration of this latter for the period of which we speak.[190]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will also be judged, that men capable of making\r\nobservations so exact, and which they had continued during so long\r\na period, would not have attributed so much importance to Sirius,\r\nas to pay him religious homage; for they would have seen that the\r\nrelations of the rising of this star with the tropical year, and with\r\nthe inundation of the Nile, were merely temporary, and took place\r\nonly in a determinate latitude. In fact, according to M. Ideler’s\r\ncalculations, in the year 2782 before Christ, Sirius appeared in\r\nUpper Egypt, on the second day after the solstice; in 1322, on the\r\nthird; and in the year 139 after Christ, on the twenty-sixth.[191] At\r\nthe present day, its heliacal rising is more than a month after the\r\nsolstice. The Egyptians would therefore set themselves by preference\r\nto finding the period, which would bring about the coincidence of\r\nthe commencement of the sacred year, with that of the true tropical\r\nyear, and then they would discover that their great period must have\r\nbeen 1508 sacred years, and not 1461.[192] Now, we assuredly do not\r\nfind any traces of this period of 1508 years in antiquity.\r\n\r\nIn general, we may defend ourselves with the idea, that, if the\r\nEgyptians had possessed so long a series of observations, and of\r\naccurate observations too, their disciple Eudoxus, who studied among\r\nthem for thirteen years, would, on his return, have brought into\r\nGreece a system of astronomy more perfect, and maps of the heavens\r\nless erroneous, and more coherent in their different parts.[193] How\r\nshould it happen that the precession of the equinoxes was not known\r\nto the Greeks, but through the works of Hipparchus, if it had been\r\nmarked in the registers of the Egyptians, and inscribed in characters\r\nso manifest upon the ceilings of their temples? And how comes it\r\nthat Ptolemy, who wrote in Egypt, should not have deigned to avail\r\nhimself of any of the observations of the Egyptians?[194]\r\n\r\nFarther, Herodotus, who lived so long with them, says nothing of\r\nthose six hours which they added to the sacred year, nor of that\r\ngreat Sothian period which resulted. On the contrary, he says\r\nexpressly that the Egyptians, making their year of 365 days, the\r\nseasons returned to the same point, so that in his time the necessity\r\nof this quarter of a day does not appear to have been suspected.[195]\r\nThalles, who had visited the priests of Egypt, less than a century\r\nbefore Herodotus, did not, in like manner, make known to his\r\ncountrymen, any other than a year of 365 days only.[196] And, if we\r\nreflect that all the colonies which migrated from Egypt, fourteen or\r\nfifteen centuries before Christ, the Jews and the Athenians, carried\r\nwith them the lunar year, it will perhaps be inferred that the year\r\nof 365 days itself had not existed in Egypt in these remote ages.\r\n\r\nI am aware that Macrobius[197] gives the Egyptians a solar year of\r\n365¼ days; but this author, who is comparatively modern, and who\r\nlived at a long period after the establishment of the fixed year\r\nof Alexandria, must have confounded the epochs. Diodorus[198] and\r\nStrabo[199] only attribute such a year to the Thebans; they do not\r\nsay that it was in general use, and they themselves did not live till\r\nlong after Herodotus.\r\n\r\nThus the Sothian or great year must have been a comparatively recent\r\ninvention, since it results from the comparison of the civil year\r\nwith this pretended heliacal year of Sirius; and it is for this\r\nreason that it is only spoken of in the works of the second and third\r\ncentury after Christ[200], and that Syncellus alone, in the ninth,\r\nseems to cite Manetho as having made mention of it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that is said to the contrary, the same opinion\r\nmust be formed of the astronomical knowledge of the Chaldeans. It is\r\nnatural enough to think, that a people who inhabited vast plains,\r\nunder a sky perpetually serene, must have been led to observe the\r\ncourse of the stars, even at a period when they still led a wandering\r\nlife, and when the stars alone could direct their courses during\r\nthe night; but since what period were they astronomers, and to what\r\nperfection did they carry the science? Here rests the question. It is\r\ngenerally allowed that Callisthenes sent to Aristotle observations\r\nmade by them, and which referred to a period of 2200 years before\r\nChrist; but this fact is related only by Simplicius[201], as stated\r\nupon the authority of Porphyry, and 600 years after Aristotle.\r\nAristotle himself says nothing on the subject, nor has any creditable\r\nastronomer spoken of it. Ptolemy mentions and makes use of ten\r\nobservations of eclipses really made by the Chaldeans; but they do\r\nnot refer to an earlier period than that of Nabonassar (721 years\r\nbefore Christ); they are inaccurate also; the time is expressed only\r\nin hours and half-hours, and the shadow only in halves or fourths of\r\nthe diameter. Notwithstanding, as they had fixed dates, the Chaldeans\r\nmust have had some knowledge of the true length of the year, and some\r\nmeans of measuring time. They appear to have known the period of\r\neighteen years, which brings back the eclipses of the moon in the\r\nsame order; a piece of knowledge which the mere inspection of their\r\nregisters would promptly afford them; but it is certain that they\r\ncould neither explain nor predict eclipses of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is from not having sufficiently understood a passage of Josephus,\r\nthat Cassini, and after him Bailly, have imagined that they\r\ndiscovered in it a luni-solar period of 600 years, which had been\r\nknown from the time of the first patriarchs[202].\r\n\r\nThus every thing leads us to believe that the great reputation of the\r\nChaldeans was given them at a more recent period, by their unworthy\r\nsuccessors, who, under the same name, sold their horoscopes and\r\npredictions throughout the whole Roman empire, and who, in order to\r\nprocure themselves more credit, attributed to their rude ancestors\r\nthe honour of the discoveries of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Indians, every body knows that Bailly, believing\r\nthat the epoch which is used as a period of departure in some of\r\ntheir astronomical tables had been actually observed, has attempted\r\nto draw from thence a proof of the great antiquity of the science\r\namong this people, or at least among the nation which had bequeathed\r\nthem its knowledge. But the whole of this system, invented with so\r\nmuch labour, falls to the ground of itself, now that it is proved\r\nthat this epoch has been adopted but of late, from calculations made\r\nbackwards, and even false in their results.[203]\r\n\r\nMr Bentley has discovered that the tables of Tirvalour, on which the\r\nassertion of Bailley especially rested, must have been calculated\r\nabout 1281 of the Christian era, or 540 years ago, and that the\r\nSurya-Siddhanta, which the Brahmins regard as their oldest scientific\r\ntreatise on astronomy, and which they pretend to have been revealed\r\nupwards of 20,000,000 of years ago, could not have been composed at\r\nan earlier period than about 760 years from the present day[204].\r\n\r\nSolstices and equinoxes indicated in the Pouranas, and calculated\r\naccording to the positions which seem to be attributed to them by the\r\nsigns of the Indian zodiac, such as they are supposed to be, have\r\nacquired the character of an enormous antiquity. A more attentive\r\nexamination of these signs or nacchatras has lately convinced M.\r\nde Paravey that reference is only made to solstices of 1200 years\r\nbefore the Christian era. This author at the same time admits, that\r\nthe place of the solstices is so inaccurately fixed, that this\r\ndetermination of their date must be received with a latitude of 200\r\nor 300 years. They are in the same predicament as those of Eudoxus\r\nand of Tcheoukong[205].\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that the Indians do not make observations, and that\r\nthey are not in possession of any of the instruments necessary for\r\nthat purpose. M. Delambre indeed admits, with Bailly and Legentil,\r\nthat they have processes of calculation, which, without proving the\r\nantiquity of their astronomy, shew at least its originality[206];\r\nand yet this conclusion can by no means be extended to their sphere;\r\nfor, independently of their twenty-seven nacchatras or lunar houses,\r\nwhich strongly resemble those of the Arabians, they have the same\r\ntwelve constellations in the zodiac as the Egyptians, Chaldeans,\r\nand Greeks[207]; and, if we refer to Mr Wilfort’s assertions, their\r\nextra-zodiacal constellations are also the same as those of the\r\nGreeks, and bear names which are merely slight alterations of their\r\nGreek names[208].\r\n\r\nIt is to Yao that the introduction of astronomy into China is\r\nattributed. He is represented, in the Chou-king, as sending\r\nastronomers toward the four cardinal points of his empire, to\r\nexamine what stars presided over the four seasons, and to regulate\r\nthe operations to be carried on at each period of the year[209], as\r\nif their dispersion was necessary for such an undertaking. About\r\n200 years later, the Chou-king speaks of an eclipse of the sun, but\r\naccompanied with ridiculous circumstances, as in all the fables of\r\nthis kind; for the whole Chinese army, headed by a general, is made\r\nto march against two astronomers, because they had not properly\r\npredicted it[210]; and it is well known that, more than 2000 years\r\nafter, the Chinese astronomers possessed no means of accurately\r\npredicting the eclipses of the sun. In 1629 of our era, at the time\r\nof their dispute with the Jesuits, they did not even know how to\r\ncalculate the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe real eclipses, recorded by Confucius in his Chronicle of the\r\nkingdom of Lou, commence only 1400 years after this, in the 776th\r\nbefore Christ, and scarcely half a century earlier than those of the\r\nChaldeans related by Ptolemy. So true is it, that the nations which\r\nescaped at the same time from the general catastrophe, also arrived\r\nabout the same period, when their circumstances have been similar,\r\nat the same degree of civilization. Now, it might be thought, from\r\nthe identity of the names of the Chinese astronomers in different\r\nreigns (they appear, according to the Chou-king, to have all been\r\nnamed _Hi_ and _Ho_), that, at this remote epoch, their profession\r\nwas hereditary in China, as it was in India, Egypt, and Babylon.\r\n\r\nThe only Chinese observation of any antiquity, which has nothing in\r\nitself to prove its want of authenticity, is that of the shadow made\r\nby _Tcheou-kong_ about 1100 years before Christ; and even it is far\r\nfrom being correct[211].\r\n\r\nHence our readers may conclude, that the inferences drawn from the\r\nalleged perfection of astronomical science among ancient nations, is\r\nnot more conclusive in favour of the excessive antiquity of those\r\nnations, than the testimonies which they have adduced in reference to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBut had this astronomy been more perfect, what would it prove?\r\nHas the progress been calculated which this science ought to make\r\namong nations who were not in any degree in possession of others;\r\nto whom the serenity of the sky, the necessities of the pastoral or\r\nagricultural life, and their superstitious ideas, would render the\r\nstars an object of general attention; where colleges, or societies\r\nof the most respectable men among them, were charged with keeping a\r\nregister of interesting phenomena, and transmitting their memory; and\r\nwhere, from the hereditary nature of the profession, the children\r\nwere brought up from the cradle in the knowledge of facts ascertained\r\nby their parents? Supposing that, among the numerous individuals of\r\nwhom the cultivation of astronomy was the sole occupation, there\r\nshould happen to be one or two possessed of extraordinary talents\r\nfor geometry, all the knowledge acquired by these nations might be\r\nattained in a few centuries.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the Chaldeans, real astronomy has only had two\r\neras, that of the Alexandrian school, which lasted 400 years, and\r\nthat of our own times, which has not existed so long. The learned\r\nperiod of the Arabians scarcely added any thing to it; and the other\r\nages have been mere blanks with regard to it. Three hundred years did\r\nnot intervene between Copernicus and the author of the _Mecanique\r\nCéleste_; and can it be believed that the Indians required thousands\r\nof years to arrive at their crude theories?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Astronomical Monuments left by the Ancients do not bear the\r\nexcessively remote dates which have been attributed to them._\r\n\r\n\r\nRecourse has therefore been had to arguments of another kind. It\r\nhas been pretended that, independently of the knowledge which these\r\nnations may have acquired, they have left monuments which bear a date\r\nfixed by the state of the heavens which they represent, and one that\r\nrefers to a very remote antiquity. The zodiacs sculptured in two\r\ntemples of Upper Egypt, are adduced as furnishing proofs perfectly\r\ndemonstrative of this assertion. They present the same figures of\r\nthe zodiacal constellations as are employed at the present day,\r\nbut distributed in a manner peculiar to themselves. The state of\r\nthe heavens at the period when these monuments were delineated, is\r\nimagined to have been represented by this distribution, and it has\r\nbeen thought that it would be possible from it to infer the precise\r\nperiod at which the edifices containing them were erected[212].\r\n\r\nBut to arrive at the high antiquity which is supposed to be deducible\r\nfrom this, it must, in the _first_ place, be supposed, that their\r\ndivision has a determinate relation to a certain state of the\r\nheavens, dependent upon the precession of the equinoxes, which causes\r\nthe colures to make the tour of the zodiac in 26,000 years; that\r\nit indicated, for example, the position of the solstitial point;\r\nand, _secondly_, that the state of the heavens represented was\r\nprecisely that which took place at the period when the monument was\r\nerected,--two suppositions which themselves, as is evident, suppose\r\na great number of others.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, are the figures of these zodiacs the\r\nconstellations,--the true groups of stars which at present bear the\r\nsame names, or merely what astronomers call signs, that is to say,\r\ndivisions of the zodiac proceeding from one of the colures, whatever\r\nplace this colure occupies? Is the point at which these zodiacs\r\nhave been divided into two bands, necessarily that of a solstice?\r\nIs the division of the side next the entrance, necessarily that of\r\nthe summer solstice? Does this division indicate, even in general, a\r\nphenomenon dependent upon the precession of the equinoxes? Does it\r\nnot refer to some period the rotation of which would be less; for\r\nexample, to the moment of the tropical year when such or such sacred\r\nyears of the Egyptians commenced, which, being shorter than the true\r\ntropical year by nearly six hours, would make the tour of the zodiac\r\nin 1508 years? Lastly, whatever signification it may have had, has it\r\nbeen intended by it to mark the time when the zodiac was sculptured,\r\nor that when the temple was built? Has not the object been to record\r\na previous state of the heavens at some period which was interesting\r\nin a religious point of view, whether it had been actually observed,\r\nor inferred from a retrograde calculation?\r\n\r\nFrom the mere announcement of such questions, it will be perceived\r\nhow complicated they necessarily are, how much subject to\r\ncontroversy any solution that might be adopted on this subject would\r\nbe, and how little qualified to serve as a solid proof, for the\r\nsolution of another problem, such as the antiquity of the Egyptian\r\nnation. And it may be said, with regard to those who have attempted\r\nto infer a date from these data, that there have arisen as many\r\nopinions as there have been authors.\r\n\r\nThe learned astronomer Mr Burkhard, from a first examination, judged\r\nthat, at Dendera, the solstice is marked by the Lion; which would\r\nmake it two signs less remote than at the present day, and the\r\ntemple at least 4000 years old[213]. He gave, at the same time an\r\nantiquity of 7000 years to that of Esne, although it is not known\r\nhow he had purposed to reconcile these numbers with what we know\r\nof the precession of the equinoxes. The late M. Lalande, seeing\r\nthat the Cancer was repeated on the two bands, imagined that the\r\nsolstice passed to the middle of that constellation; but as this\r\nwas the case also in the sphere of Eudoxus, he concluded that some\r\nGrecian artist might have represented this sphere on the ceiling of\r\nan Egyptian temple, without knowing that it represented a state of\r\nthe heavens which no longer existed[214]. This, as is seen, was a\r\nconclusion very different from that of Mr Burkhard. Dupuis was the\r\nfirst who thought it necessary to search for proofs of the idea,\r\nin some measure confidently adopted, that it was the solstice that\r\nwas denoted. He found them, with reference to the great zodiac of\r\nDendera, in the globe on the top of the pyramid, and in several\r\nemblems placed near different signs, and which he imagined, sometimes\r\naccording to the opinion of ancient authors, such as Plutarch, Horus\r\nApollo, or Clement of Alexandria, sometimes according to his own\r\nconjectures, ought to be regarded as representing phenomena which\r\nhad been really those of the seasons affected at each sign. As for\r\nthe rest, he maintained that this state of the heavens affords the\r\ndate of the monument, and that it is the original, and not a copy, of\r\nthe sphere of Eudoxus, that was represented at Dendera, which would\r\nrefer it to a period of 1468 years before Christ, or to the reign of\r\nSesostris. The number of nineteen boats, however, placed under each\r\nband, furnished him with the idea that the solstice might probably\r\nhave been at the nineteenth degree of the sign, which would make it\r\n288 years older[215].\r\n\r\nMr Hamilton[216] having remarked, that, at Dendera, the Scarabæus\r\nbelonging to the side of the ascending signs is smaller than that of\r\nthe other side, an English author[217] has concluded from this that\r\nthe solstice may have been nearer its actual point than the middle\r\nof the Cancer, which would carry us back to a period of 1000 or 1200\r\nyears before Christ.\r\n\r\nThe late M. Nouet, judging that the globe, the rays, and the horned\r\nhead, or head of Isis, represent the heliacal rising of Sirius,\r\nsupposed that it was intended to mark an epoch of the Sothian\r\nperiod, but that it was intended to mark it by the place which the\r\nsolstice occupied. Now, in the last but one of these periods, that\r\nwhich elapsed between 2782 and 1322 before Christ, the solstice had\r\npassed from 30° 48′ of the constellation of the Lion to 13° 34′ of\r\nCancer. At the middle of this period, it was therefore at 23° 34′ of\r\ncancer. The heliacal rising of Sirius happened then some days after\r\nthe solstice; and this is nearly what has been indicated, according\r\nto M. Nouet, by the repetition of the Scarabæus, and by the figure\r\nof Sirius with the rays of the sun placed at the commencement of the\r\nband to the right. Calculating upon this basis, he concludes that the\r\ntemple of Dendera was built 2052 years before Christ, and that of\r\nEsne 4600[218].\r\n\r\nAll these calculations, even admitting that the division marks the\r\nsolstice, would still be susceptible of many modifications; and, at\r\nfirst, it appears that their authors have supposed the constellations\r\nall of thirty degrees like the signs, and have not reflected that\r\nit is far from being the case that they are thus equal, at least\r\nas they are represented at the present day, and as the Greeks have\r\ntransmitted them to us. In reality, the solstice, which is at present\r\non this side of the first stars of the constellation of Gemini,\r\ncould only have left the first stars of the constellation of Cancer\r\nforty-five years before Christ, and had left the constellation of Leo\r\nonly 1260 years before the same era.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy distinguished and learned colleague, M.

Tables, and are those of Lacaille, Bradley, or Flamstead. The\r\nfirst and the last of each constellation have been taken, as well as\r\nsome of the brightest of the intermediate stars. The third column\r\nindicates the year in which the longitude of the star was 0′, that\r\nis to say, that in which the star was in the equinoxial colure of\r\nspring. The last column indicates the year when the star was in the\r\nsolstitial colure, whether of winter or of summer.\r\n\r\n“For Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, the winter solstice has been chosen;\r\nfor the other constellations the summer solstice has been chosen,\r\nfor the sake of not receding into too remote antiquity, and of not\r\napproaching too near modern times. It will be easy to find the\r\nopposite solstice, by adding the semiperiod of 12,960 years. The same\r\nrule will serve for finding the time when the star has been, or will\r\nbe, at the autumnal equinox.\r\n\r\n“The sign - indicates the years before our era, the sign + the\r\nyear of our era; and the last line, at the end of each sign under\r\nthe title of _duration_, gives the extent of the constellation in\r\ndegrees, and the time which the equinox, or the solstice, occupies in\r\ntraversing the constellation from one end to the other.\r\n\r\n“The precession of 50″ yearly has been supposed, this being the\r\nresult of the comparison of the catalogue of Hipparchus with the\r\nmodern catalogues. We have thus the advantage of round numbers, and a\r\ngeneral accuracy that may be relied upon. The entire period is thus\r\n25,920 years; the semiperiod, 12,960 years; the quarter period, 6480\r\nyears; the twelfth, or a sign, 2160 years.\r\n\r\n“It is to be remarked, that the constellations leave empty spaces\r\nbetween them, and that sometimes they encroach upon each other. Thus,\r\nbetween the last star of Scorpio, and the first of Sagittarius,\r\nthere is an interval of 6⅔ degrees. On the other hand, the last\r\nof Capricorn is more advanced by 14° in longitude, than the first\r\nof Aquarius. Hence, even independently of the inequality of the\r\nsun’s motion, the constellations would afford a very unequal and\r\nvery erroneous measure of the year and its months. The signs of 30°\r\nfurnish a more convenient and less defective one. But the signs are\r\nmerely a geometrical conception; they can neither be distinguished\r\nnor observed; and they are continually changing place from the\r\nretrogradation of the equinoxial point.\r\n\r\n“We have at all times been able to determine, in a rough manner,\r\nthe equinoxes and solstices; at the long run it has been remarked,\r\nthat the appearance of the heavens was no longer exactly the same\r\nthat it anciently was at the times of the equinoxes and solstices.\r\nBut we have never been able to observe exactly the heliacal rising\r\nof a star, being always necessarily some days wide of it; and people\r\nfrequently speak of it, without possessing a fixed datum on which\r\nto count. Before Hipparchus, we find nothing, either in books or\r\nin traditions, that can be submitted to calculation; and it is\r\nthis which has given rise to so many systems. Controversies have\r\narisen without a sufficient knowledge of the subject. Those who are\r\nnot astronomers may form ideas as beautiful as they please of the\r\nknowledge of the Chaldeans, Egyptians, &c.; no real inconvenience\r\nwill result. The enterprise and knowledge of the moderns may be lent\r\nto these nations, but nothing can be borrowed from them; for they\r\nhave either had nothing, or they have left nothing. Astronomers will\r\nnever derive from the ancients any thing that can be of the slightest\r\nutility. Let us leave to the learned their vain conjectures, and\r\nconfess our utter ignorance respecting things of little use in\r\nthemselves, and of which no monument remains.\r\n\r\n“The limits of the constellations vary according to the authors which\r\nwe consult. We find these limits extend or contract, as we pass\r\nfrom Hipparchus to Tycho, from Tycho to Hevelius, from Hevelius to\r\nFlamstead, Lacaille, Bradley, or Piazzi.\r\n\r\n“I have said elsewhere, the constellations are good for nothing,\r\nunless at the most to enable us to mark the stars with more ease;\r\nwhereas the stars in particular afford fixed points to which we\r\ncan refer the motions, whether of the colures or of the planets.\r\nAstronomy commenced only at the period when Hipparchus made the first\r\ncatalogue of the stars, measured the revolution of the sun, that of\r\nthe moon, and their principal inequalities. The rest presents nothing\r\nbut darkness, uncertainty, and gross error. The time would be lost\r\nthat were occupied in attempting to reduce this chaos to order.\r\n\r\n“I have given, with the exception of a few particulars, the whole\r\nof my opinion on this subject. I am nowise anxious about making\r\nconverts, for it gives me little concern whether my ideas be adopted\r\nor not; but, if my reasons be compared with the reveries of Newton,\r\nHerschell, Bailly, and so many others, it is not impossible but that,\r\nin time, these more or less brilliant chimeras will no longer be\r\nrelished.\r\n\r\n“I have attempted to determine the extent of the constellations,\r\naccording to the catasterisms of Eratosthenes; but the thing is\r\nreally impossible. The matter would be still worse were we to\r\nconsult Hygin, and especially Firmicus. The following is what I have\r\nmade out from Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\n  CONSTELLATIONS.

Jollois and Devilliers,--to whose unremitting zeal we are\r\nindebted for an accurate knowledge of these famous monuments, always\r\nconsidering the division towards the entrance of the porch as the\r\nsolstice, and judging that the Virgin must have been regarded as the\r\nfirst of the descending constellations, insomuch as the solstice had\r\nnot receded at least so far as the middle of the constellation of the\r\nLion; and, believing that they saw farther, as we have mentioned,\r\nthat the Lion is divided in the great zodiac of Esne, have not\r\ngiven to that zodiac a more remote antiquity than 2160 years before\r\nChrist.[220]\r\n\r\nMr Hamilton, who was the first that observed this division of the\r\nsign of the Lion, in the zodiac of Esne, reduced the distance of\r\nthe period at which the solstice occurred there, to 1400 years\r\nbefore Christ. A great many other opinions have appeared on the same\r\nsubject. M. Rhode, for example, has proposed two. The first refers\r\nthe zodiac of the portico of Dendera to a period of 591 years before\r\nChrist; the second, to 1290[221]. M. Latreille has fixed the period\r\nof this zodiac at 670 years before Christ; that of the planisphere at\r\n550; that of the zodiac of the great temple of Esne at 2550; and that\r\nof the small one at 1760.\r\n\r\nBut a difficulty inherent in all the dates, which proceed on the\r\ndouble supposition, that the division marks the solstice, and that\r\nthe position of the solstice marks the epoch of the monument, is the\r\nunavoidable consequence that the zodiac of Esne must have been at\r\nleast 2000, and perhaps 3000, years[222] older than that of Dendera,\r\na consequence which evidently involves the supposition in ruin;\r\nfor no one, in any degree acquainted with the history of the arts,\r\ncould believe, that two edifices, so similar in their style of\r\narchitecture, could have been erected at periods so remote from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of this impossibility, joined always to the belief that\r\nthis division of the zodiacs indicates a date, has given rise to\r\nanother conjecture, namely, that the intention had been to mark the\r\nparticular sacred year of the Egyptians, in which the monument had\r\nbeen erected. As these sacred years consisted only of 365 days, if\r\nthe sun, at the commencement of one occupied the commencement of a\r\nconstellation, he would be nearly six hours later in returning to the\r\ncommencement of the following year, and, after 121 years, he would\r\nonly be at the commencement of the preceding sign. It seems natural\r\nenough that the builders of a temple might wish to indicate about\r\nwhat period of the great, or Sothian year, it had been erected; and\r\nthe indications of the sign, by which the sacred year then commenced,\r\nwas a good enough means. It will be perceived, that, calculating upon\r\nthis assumption, there will be an interval of from 120 to 150 years\r\nbetween the temple of Esne and that of Dendera. But, in his mode of\r\nsolving the problem, there remained to be determined in which of the\r\ngreat years these buildings had been erected, whether in that which\r\nended in the year 138 after, or in that which ended in 1322 before\r\nChrist, or in some other.\r\n\r\nThe late Visconti, who was the first author of this hypothesis,\r\ntaking the sacred year, whose commencement corresponded with the sign\r\nof the Lion, and judging from the resemblance of the signs, that they\r\nhad been represented at a period when the opinions of the Greeks were\r\nnot unknown to the Egyptians, was naturally led to make choice of the\r\nend of the last great year, or the space that elapsed between the\r\nyear 12 and the year 138 after Christ[223], which appeared to him to\r\naccord with the Greek inscription, of which, however, he knew little\r\nmore than that it was said to make mention of one of the Cæsars.\r\n\r\nM. Testa, seeking the date of the monument in another order of ideas,\r\nwent so far as to suppose that since the Virgin is seen at Esne, at\r\nthe head of the zodiac, it was meant thereby to represent the era of\r\nthe battle of Actium, such as it had been established with regard\r\nto Egypt, by a decree of the senate, mentioned by Dion Cassius,\r\nand which commenced in the month of September, the day on which\r\nAlexandria was taken by Augustus.[224]\r\n\r\nM. de Paravey considered these zodiacs in a new point of view, which\r\nembraced at once both the revolution of the equinoxes, and that of\r\nthe great year. Supposing that the circular planisphere of Dendera\r\nmust have been set to the east, and that the axis from north to\r\nsouth is the line of the solstices, he found the summer solstice at\r\nthe second of the Twins, and that of winter at the buttock of the\r\nSagittary, while the line of the equinoxes would have passed through\r\nthe Fishes and the Virgin, from which he obtained for date the first\r\ncentury of our era.\r\n\r\nAccording to this method, the division of the zodiac of the portico\r\ncould no longer refer to the colures, and the mark of the solstice\r\nmust be sought for elsewhere. M. de Paravey having remarked that\r\nthere are between all the signs figures of women bearing a star upon\r\ntheir heads, and marching in the same direction, and observing that\r\nthe one which comes after the twins, is alone turned in a direction\r\ncontrary to the others, judged that it indicates the _conversion_ of\r\nthe sun or the tropic, and that this zodiac corresponds in this way\r\nwith the planisphere.\r\n\r\nBy applying the idea of easting to the small zodiac of Esne, the\r\nsolstices would be found between the Twins and the Bull, and between\r\nthe Scorpion and Sagittary; they would even be marked by the change\r\nof direction of the Bull, and by the winged Rams placed across at\r\nthese two places. In the great zodiac of the same city, the marks\r\nwould be the cross position of the Bull, and the reversed one of\r\nthe Sagittary. There would thus be but a portion of a constellation\r\ntraversed between the dates of Esne and those of Dendera, but even\r\nthis would be still too long for buildings so closely resembling each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAn operation of the late M. Delambre upon the circular planisphere\r\nappears to confirm these conjectures, detracting from its remote\r\nantiquity; for, on placing the stars upon Hipparchus’s projection,\r\naccording to the theory of that astronomer, and according to the\r\npositions which he has given them in his catalogue; and augmenting\r\nall the longitudes, so that the solstice might pass through the\r\nsecond of the Twins, he nearly reproduced this planisphere; and\r\n“the resemblance,” says he, “would have been still greater, had\r\nthe longitudes been adopted such as they are in the catalogue of\r\nPtolemy, for the year 123 of our era. On the contrary, by referring\r\nto twenty-five or twenty-six centuries back, the right ascensions and\r\nthe declinations will be considerably changed, and the projection\r\nwill assume quite a different figure[225]. All our calculations,”\r\nadds this great astronomer, “lead us to this conclusion, that the\r\nsculptures are posterior to the epoch of Alexander.”\r\n\r\nIn reality, the circular planisphere having been brought to Paris by\r\nthe care of MM. Saunier and Lelorrain, M. Biot, in a work founded\r\nupon precise measurements and calculations full of ingenuity, has\r\ndetermined that it represents, according to an exact geometrical\r\nprojection, the state of the heavens, such as it was 700 years before\r\nChrist; but he by no means concludes that it had been sculptured at\r\nthat period[226].\r\n\r\nIn fact, all these efforts of intellect and science, in so far as\r\nthey concern the epoch of the monuments, have become superfluous,\r\nsince finishing where they should naturally have begun, if the first\r\nobservers had not been blinded by prejudice, people have taken the\r\ntrouble of copying and restoring the Greek inscriptions engraved upon\r\nthese monuments, and especially since M. Champollion has discovered\r\nthe method of decyphering those which are expressed in hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nIt is now certain, and the Greek inscriptions agree with the\r\nhieroglyphical inscriptions in proving it, it is certain, we say,\r\nthat the temples in which zodiacs have been sculptured, were built\r\nduring the time when Egypt was subject to the Romans. The portico\r\nof the temple of Dendera, according to the Greek inscription of its\r\nfrontispiece, is consecrated to the safety of Tiberius[227]. On the\r\nplanisphere of the same temple we read the title of _Autocrator_ in\r\nhieroglyphical characters[228]; and it is probable that it refers to\r\nNero. The small temple of Esne, that of which the origin has been\r\nplaced on the lowest calculation between 2700 and 3000 years before\r\nChrist, has a column sculptured and painted in the sixth year of\r\nAntonine, 147 years after Christ, and it is painted and sculptured in\r\nthe same style as the zodiac which is near it[229].\r\n\r\nFurther, we have a proof that this division of the zodiac, in such\r\nor such sign, has no reference to the precession of the equinoxes,\r\nor to the displacement of the solstice. A mummy case, lately brought\r\nfrom Thebes by M. Caillaud, and containing, according to the very\r\nlegible Greek inscription upon it, the body of a young man who died\r\nin the ninth year of Trajan, 116 years after Christ[230], presents a\r\nzodiac divided at the same point as those of Dendera[231]; and all\r\nthe appearances indicate that this division marks some astrological\r\ntheme relative to the individual, a conclusion which may probably\r\nbe equally applied to the division of the zodiacs contained in the\r\ntemples. It may mark either the astrological theme of the time of\r\ntheir erection, or that of the prince to whose safety they had\r\nbeen consecrated, or such another epoch with relation to which the\r\nposition of the sun would have appeared of importance to be noticed.\r\n\r\nThus are dissipated for ever the conclusions which people had drawn\r\nfrom some ill explained monuments, against the newness of the\r\ncontinents and nations; and we might have dispensed with treating of\r\nthem so much in detail had they not been so recent, and had they not\r\nmade sufficient impression still to retain their influence over the\r\nminds of some individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Zodiac is far from bearing in itself a certain and excessively\r\nremote date._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there are writers who have maintained that the zodiac bears in\r\nitself the date of its invention, because the names and figures\r\ngiven to its constellations are an index of the position of the\r\ncolures at the time when it was invented; and this date, according\r\nto several, is so evident and so remote, that it is quite a matter\r\nof indifference whether the representations which we possess of this\r\ncircle are more or less ancient.\r\n\r\nThey do not attend to the circumstance that, in this sort of\r\nargument, there is a complication of three suppositions equally\r\nuncertain: the country in which the zodiac is presumed to have been\r\ninvented, the signification which is supposed to have been given\r\nto the constellations which occupy it, and the position in which\r\nthe colures were with relation to each constellation, when this\r\nsignification was attributed to it. According as other allegories\r\nhave been imagined, or as these allegories are admitted to have\r\nreferred to the constellation of which the sun occupied the first\r\ndegrees, or to that of which it occupied the middle, or to that\r\ninto which it began to enter, that is to say, of which it occupied\r\nthe last degrees; or, lastly, to that which was opposite to him,\r\nand which rose at night; or according as the invention of these\r\nallegories is placed in a different climate, must the date of the\r\nzodiac also be changed. The possible variations in this respect might\r\ncomprehend so much as the half of the revolution of the fixed stars,\r\nthat is to say, 13,000 years, and even more.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Pluche, generalizing some indications of the ancients,\r\nhas imagined, that the Ram announces the commencement of the sun’s\r\nelevation, and the vernal equinox; that the Cancer indicates his\r\nretrogradation to the summer solstice; that the Balance, the sign of\r\nequality, marks the autumnal equinox[232]; and that the Capricorn, a\r\nclimbing animal, indicates the winter solstice, after which the sun\r\nreturns to us. According to this method, by placing the inventors\r\nof the zodiac in a temperate climate, we should have rains under\r\nAquarius, the dropping of lambs and kids under the Gemini, violent\r\nheats under the Lion, gathering of the harvest under the Virgin,\r\nthe time of hunting under the Sagittary, &c.; and the emblems would\r\nbe appropriate enough. If we should then place the colures at the\r\ncommencement of the constellations, or at least the equinox at the\r\nfirst stars of Aries, we should, in the first instance, arrive at\r\na period of only 389 years before Christ, an epoch evidently too\r\nmodern, and which would render it necessary to recur to a complete\r\nequinoxial period, or 26,000 years. But if the equinox be supposed to\r\npass through the middle of the constellation, a period of about 1000\r\nor 1200 years higher is obtained, 1600 or 1700 years before Christ;\r\nand this is what several celebrated men have believed to be the true\r\nepoch of the invention of the zodiac, the honour of which they have,\r\nfor other reasons not sufficiently weighty, conferred upon Chiron.\r\n\r\nBut Dupuis, who required for the origin which he endeavoured to\r\nattribute to all religions, that astronomy, and, in particular, the\r\nfigures of the zodiac should in some measure have preceded all other\r\nhuman institutions, has sought another climate for the purpose of\r\nfinding other explanations for the emblems, and for that of deducing\r\nanother epoch from them. If, assuming the Balance as an equinoxial\r\nsign, but supposing it at the vernal equinox, it be presumed that\r\nthe zodiac has been invented in Egypt, other sufficiently plausible\r\nexplanations might in fact be found for the climate of that\r\ncountry.[233] The Capricorn, an animal with the tail of a fish,\r\nwould mark the commencement of the rise of the Nile at the summer\r\nsolstice; the Aquarius and Fishes, the progress and diminution of\r\nthe inundation; the Bull, the time of labouring; the Virgin, the\r\ntime of reaping; and they would mark them at the periods when these\r\noperations actually took place. In this system, the zodiac would have\r\n15,000 years[234] for a sun supposed at the first degree of each\r\nsign, more than 16,000 for the middle, and 4000 only, on supposing\r\nthat the emblem has been given to the sign at the opposite of which\r\nthe sun was[235]. It is to the 15,000 years that Dupuis has attached\r\nhimself; and it is upon this date that he has founded the whole\r\nsystem of his celebrated work.\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting those, however, who, admitting that the zodiac\r\nhas been invented in Egypt, have imagined allegories applicable\r\nto later times. Thus, according to Mr Hamilton, the Virgin would\r\nrepresent the land of Egypt when not yet fecundated by the\r\ninundation; the Lion, the season when that country is most liable to\r\nbe overrun by ferocious animals, and so on[236].\r\n\r\nThe high antiquity of 15,000 years would besides induce this absurd\r\nconsequence, that the Egyptians, those men who represented every\r\nthing by emblems, and who must have attached a great importance to\r\nthe circumstance that these emblems were conformable to the ideas\r\nwhich they were intended to represent, had preserved the signs\r\nof the zodiac thousands of years after they no longer in any way\r\ncorresponded with their original signification.\r\n\r\nThe late M. Remi Raige endeavoured to support the opinion of Dupuis\r\nby an argument of an entirely new kind[237]. Having remarked that\r\nsignifications more or less analogous to the figures of the signs of\r\nthe zodiac, might be found for the Egyptian names of the months, on\r\nexplaining them by the oriental languages, and finding in Ptolemy\r\nthat _epifi_, which signifies _capricorn_, commences at the 20th of\r\nJune, and therefore comes immediately after the summer solstice, he\r\nconcluded from thence, that, at the beginning, Capricorn itself was\r\nat the summer solstice, and so of the other signs, as Dupuis had\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nBut, independently of all that there is merely conjectural in these\r\netymologies, Raige did not perceive that it was simply by chance\r\nthat, five years after the battle of Actium, in the year 25 before\r\nChrist, at the establishment of the fixed year of Alexandria, the\r\nfirst day of _Thoth_ was found to correspond with the 29th of the\r\nJulian August, and continued to correspond since that time. It is\r\nonly from this epoch that the Egyptian months commenced at fixed days\r\nof the Julian year, and only at Alexandria: even Ptolemy did not the\r\nless continue to employ in his Almagest the ancient Egyptian year\r\nwith its vague months[238].\r\n\r\nWhy might not the names of the signs have been given to the months\r\nat some epoch, or the names of the months to the signs, in the\r\nsame arbitrary manner in which the Indians have given to their\r\ntwenty-seven months twelve names, selected from among those of their\r\nlunar houses, for reasons which it is impossible at the present day\r\nto determine[239]? The absurdity which there would have been in\r\npreserving for the constellations, during 15,000 years, figures and\r\nsymbolical names which no longer presented any relation with their\r\nposition, would have been more evident had it been carried so far as\r\nto preserve to the months those same names which were incessantly in\r\nthe mouths of the people, and whose inaptitude would be every moment\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nAnd what, besides, would all these systems come to, had the figures\r\nand the names of the zodiacal constellations been given to them\r\nwithout any relation to the course of the sun; as their inequality,\r\nthe extension of several of them beyond the zodiac, and their\r\nmanifest connection with the neighbouring constellations, seem to\r\ndemonstrate was the case[240].\r\n\r\nWhat would still happen, if, as Macrobius expressly says[241], each\r\nsign must have been an emblem of the sun, considered in some one of\r\nits effects or of its general phenomena, and without reference to the\r\nmonths when it passes, whether into the sign, or to its opposite?\r\n\r\nLastly, What if the names had been given in an abstract manner\r\nto the divisions of space or time, as they are now given by\r\nastronomers to what they call the signs, and had not been applied\r\nto the constellations or groups of stars, but at a period\r\ndetermined by chance, so that nothing could be concluded from their\r\nsignification[242]?\r\n\r\nIn these suggestions there is, without doubt, enough to give an\r\ningenuous mind a distaste for seeking to find in astronomy proofs\r\nof the antiquity of the nations. But were these alleged proofs as\r\ncertain as they are vague and destitute of any satisfactory result,\r\nwhat could be concluded from them against the great catastrophe,\r\nwhich has left monuments amply demonstrative in other respects of\r\nits existence? All that can be admitted in this matter is, what some\r\nmoderns have thought, that astronomy was among the number of the\r\nsciences preserved by those whom this catastrophe dispersed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exaggerations relative to the Antiquity of certain Mining\r\nOperations._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of certain mining operations has also been much\r\nexaggerated. A very late writer has imagined, that the mines of the\r\nisland of Elba, judging from the rubbish carried out of them, must\r\nhave been wrought for more than 40,000 years; but another author,\r\nwho has also examined this rubbish with attention, has reduced the\r\nperiod in question to a little more than 5000 years,[243] and this\r\neven on the supposition that the ancients did not extract annually\r\nmore than a fourth part of the quantity of ore now wrought. But what\r\nreason could there be to suppose that the Romans, for example, who\r\nconsumed so much iron in their armies, derived so little advantage\r\nfrom these mines? Moreover, if these mines had been wrought for even\r\n4000 years only, how should iron have been so little known in the\r\ntimes of remote antiquity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Conclusion relative to the Period of the last Revolution._\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree, therefore, with MM. Deluc and Dolomieu, in thinking, that\r\nif any thing in geology be established, it is, that the surface of\r\nour globe has undergone a great and sudden revolution, the date of\r\nwhich cannot be referred to a much earlier period than five or six\r\nthousand years ago; that this revolution overwhelmed and caused to\r\ndisappear the countries which were previously inhabited by man, and\r\nthe species of animals now best known; that, on the other hand, it\r\nlaid dry the bottom of the last sea, and formed of it the countries\r\nwhich are at the present day inhabited; that it is since the\r\noccurrence of this revolution that the small number of individuals\r\ndispersed by it have spread and propagated over the newly exposed\r\nlands, and, consequently, that it is since this epoch only, that\r\nhuman societies have assumed a progressive march, that they have\r\nformed establishments, raised monuments, collected natural facts, and\r\ninvented scientific systems.\r\n\r\nBut the countries which are at present inhabited, and which the last\r\nrevolution laid dry, had already been previously inhabited, if not\r\nby men, at least by land animals, and, therefore, one preceding\r\nrevolution at least had put them under water; and if we may judge by\r\nthe different orders of animals the remains of which are observed in\r\nthem, they had perhaps been subjected to two or three irruptions of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Further Researches to be made in Geology._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese alternations now appear to me to form the problem in geology\r\nthat it is of most importance to solve, or rather to define and\r\ncircumscribe within due limits; for, in order to resolve it\r\nsatisfactorily, it would be necessary to discover the cause of these\r\nevents,--an undertaking which presents a difficulty of quite a\r\ndifferent kind.\r\n\r\nI repeat it, we see pretty clearly what is going on at the surface\r\nof the continents in their present state; we have formed a tolerable\r\nconception of the uniform progress and regular succession of the\r\nprimitive formations, but the study of the secondary formations has\r\nbeen little more than merely commenced. That wonderful series of\r\nunknown zoophytes and marine mollusca, succeeded by reptiles and\r\nfresh-water fishes equally unknown; and these again replaced, in\r\ntheir turn, by other zoophytes and mollusca, more nearly related\r\nto those of the present day; those land animals, and those equally\r\nunknown fresh water mollusca and other animals which next occupied\r\nthe surface, to be again displaced but by mollusca and other animals\r\nsimilar to those of our present seas; the relations of these\r\ndiversified beings to the plants the remains of which accompany\r\ntheirs, the connection of these two kingdoms with the mineral\r\nstrata in which they are deposited; the greater or less uniformity\r\nexisting between these different orders of beings in the different\r\nbasins;--these are phenomena which appear to me imperiously to demand\r\nthe attention of philosophers.\r\n\r\nRendered interesting by the variety of the products of the partial\r\nor general revolutions of this epoch, and by the abundance of the\r\nvarious species that figure alternately on the stage, this study\r\nis divested of the dryness of that of the primordial formations,\r\nand does not, like it, almost necessarily launch into hypotheses.\r\nThe facts are so direct, so curious, and so evident, that they are\r\nsufficient, so to speak, to satisfy the most ardent imagination;\r\nand the conclusions to which they lead from time to time, however\r\nscrupulous the observer may be, having nothing vague in them, are\r\nequally free of any thing arbitrary. In fine, it is in those events\r\nthat approach nearer to our own times, that we may hope to find some\r\ntraces of more ancient events, and of their causes; if, indeed, after\r\nso many fruitless attempts as have been already made, one may be\r\npermitted to flatter himself with such a hope.\r\n\r\nThese ideas have haunted, I may almost say have tormented me, during\r\nmy researches among fossil bones, the results of which I have\r\nlately presented to the public; researches which embrace but a very\r\nsmall part of those phenomena of the age preceding the last general\r\nrevolution of the globe, and which are yet intimately connected with\r\nall the others. It was almost impossible that the desire should not\r\narise of investigating the general mass of these phenomena, at least\r\nas they occur in a limited space around us. My excellent friend, M.\r\nBrongniart, in whose mind other studies excited the same desire,\r\nhad the complaisance to associate me with himself in the task; and\r\nit is thus that we have laid the first foundations of our labours\r\nupon the environs of Paris. But this work, while it still bears my\r\nname, has become almost entirely that of my friend, from the infinite\r\nattention which he has bestowed, since the first conception of our\r\nplan, and since our journeys, upon the profound investigation of\r\nthe objects, and the perfecting and arranging of the whole. I have\r\nplaced it, with M. Brongniart’s consent, in the second part of my\r\n“Recherches,” in that in which I treat of the fossil bones of our\r\nneighbourhood. Although apparently relating only to a rather limited\r\nextent of country, it affords numerous results, which are applicable\r\nto geology in general, and, in this point of view, it may be\r\nconsidered as intimately connected with the present discourse; at the\r\nsame time, that it is, without a doubt, one of the best ornaments of\r\nmy work[244].\r\n\r\nIn it there is presented the history of the most recent changes\r\nthat have taken place in a particular basin, and it descends so\r\nfar as the Chalk formation, the extent of which over the globe is\r\nvastly more considerable than that of the materials of the basin\r\nof Paris. The chalk, which has been considered so modern, is thus\r\nfound to be advanced in antiquity among the ages of the great period\r\npreceding the last catastrophe. It forms a sort of limit between the\r\nmost recent formations, those to which the name of _Tertiary_ may\r\nbe reserved, and the formations which are named _Secondary_, which\r\nhave been deposited before the Chalk, but after the Primitive and\r\nTransition formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation of the Observations upon the Succession of the\r\nTertiary Formations._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most superficial strata, those deposits of mud and clayey sand,\r\nmixed with rolled pebbles, that have been transported from distant\r\ncountries, and filled with bones of land animals, the species of\r\nwhich are for the most part unknown, or at least foreign to the\r\ncountry in which they are found, seem especially to have covered\r\nall the plains, filled the bottom of all the caverns, and choked up\r\nall the fissures of rocks that have come in their way. Described\r\nwith particular care by Mr Buckland, under the name of _diluvium_,\r\nand very different from those other beds equally consisting of\r\ntransported matters, continually deposited by torrents and rivers,\r\nwhich contain only bones of animals that still live in the country,\r\nand distinguished by the name of _alluvium_, the former are now\r\nconsidered by all geologists as exhibiting the most obvious proof of\r\nthe immense inundation which has been the last of the catastrophes of\r\nour globe[245].\r\n\r\nBetween this diluvium and the chalk, are the formations alternately\r\nfilled with fresh water and salt water productions, which mark the\r\nirruptions and retreatings of the sea, to which this part of the\r\nglobe has been subjected, since the deposition of the chalk-strata:\r\nfirst, marls and buhrstones, or cavernous quartz, filled with\r\nfresh-water shells, similar to those of our marshes and pools; under\r\nthem marls, sandstones, and limestones, all the shells of which are\r\nmarine, such as oysters, &c.\r\n\r\nAt a greater depth are found fresh water formations of an older date,\r\nand particularly those famous gypsum deposits of the neighbourhood\r\nof Paris, which have afforded so much facility in ornamenting the\r\nbuildings of that great city, and in which we have discovered whole\r\ngenera of land-animals, of which no traces had been elsewhere\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nThey rest upon those not less remarkable beds of limestone, of\r\nwhich our capital is built, in the more or less compact texture of\r\nwhich the patience and sagacity of our naturalists, and of several\r\nardent collectors, have already detected more than 800 species of\r\nshells, all of them marine, but the greater part unknown in the\r\npresently-existing sea. They also contain only bones of fishes, and\r\nof cetacea and other marine mammifera.\r\n\r\nUnder this marine limestone there is another fresh water deposit,\r\nformed of clay, in which there are interposed large beds of lignite\r\n(brown coal), or that sort of fossil-coal which is of more recent\r\norigin than the common or black coal. Among shells, which are always\r\nof fresh water origin, there are also found bones in the deposit;\r\nbut, what is remarkable, bones of reptiles, and not of mammifera. It\r\nis filled with crocodiles and tortoises, but the genera of extinct\r\nmammifera which the gypsum contains, are not found in it: they\r\nevidently did not exist in the country when these clays and lignites\r\nwere formed.\r\n\r\nThis fresh water formation, the oldest which has been distinguished\r\nin our neighbourhood, and which supports all the formations which we\r\nhave just enumerated, is itself supported and embraced on all sides\r\nby the chalk, an immense formation, both as to thickness and extent,\r\nwhich shews itself in very distant countries, such as Pomerania and\r\nPoland; but which, in our vicinity, reigns with a sort of continuity\r\nin Berri, Champagne, Picardy, Upper Normandy, and a part of England,\r\nand thus forms a great circle, or rather a great basin, in which the\r\ndeposits of which we have been speaking are contained, but of which\r\nthey also cover the edges in the places where they were less elevated.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is not in our basin only that these various formations\r\nhave been deposited. In the other countries where the surface of\r\nthe chalk presented similar cavities for them; in those even where\r\nthere was no chalk, and where the older formations alone presented\r\nthemselves as supports, circumstances often led to the formation\r\nof deposits more or less similar to ours, and containing the same\r\norganic bodies.\r\n\r\nOur formations containing fresh-water shells, have been seen in\r\nEngland, in Spain, and even so far as the confines of Poland.\r\n\r\nThe marine shells interposed between them, have been found along the\r\nwhole course of the Appenines.\r\n\r\nSome of the quadrupeds of our gypsum deposits, our palæotheria, for\r\nexample, have also left their bones in certain gypseous formations of\r\nthe Velai, and in the molasse quarries of the south of France.\r\n\r\nThus the partial revolutions which have taken place in our\r\nneighbourhood, between the period of the chalk and that of the great\r\ninundation, and during which the sea threw itself upon our districts\r\nor retired from them, had also taken place in a multitude of other\r\ncountries. It seems as if the globe had undergone a long series\r\nof changes by which variations were produced, probably in close\r\nsuccession, as the deposits which they have left nowhere shew much\r\nthickness or solidity. The chalk has been produced by a more tranquil\r\nand more continuous sea; it contains only marine productions, among\r\nwhich there are, however, some very remarkable vertebrate animals,\r\nbut all of the class of reptiles and fishes; large tortoises, vast\r\nlizards, and other similar animals.\r\n\r\nThe formations anterior to the chalk, and in the hollows of which the\r\nchalk is itself deposited, as the formations of our neighbourhood\r\nare in its hollows, form a great part of Germany and England; and the\r\nefforts which the naturalists of these two countries have recently\r\nmade according with ours, and proceeding upon the same principles,\r\ncombined with those which had been previously tried by the school of\r\nWerner, will soon leave nothing to be desired with respect to our\r\nknowledge of them. Messrs de Humboldt and de Bonnard in France and\r\nGermany, and Messrs Buckland and Conybeare in England, have furnished\r\nthe most complete and most instructive accounts of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table, in which not only the secondary formations have\r\nbeen arranged, but the whole series of strata, from the oldest known\r\nto the most modern and most superficial, has been politely furnished\r\nme by M. de Humboldt, to adorn my work. It may be considered as an\r\nepitome of the labours of geologists up to the present period[246].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TABLE of Geological Formations in the order of their superposition._\r\nBy M.

Beneath this are ferruginous\r\nsands. In many countries both of these deposits are agglutinated into\r\nbeds of sandstone, in which lignites, amber, and remains of reptiles,\r\nare also observed.\r\n\r\nUnder this, we find the great mass of strata which compose the Jura\r\nchain, and that of the mountains by which it is continued into Suabia\r\nand Franconia, the principal ridges of the Apennines, and multitudes\r\nof beds in France and England. It consists of limestone-schists,\r\nrich in fishes and crustacea; vast beds of oolites, or of a granular\r\nlimestone; grey marly limestones, with pyrites, characterised by\r\nthe presence of ammonites, of oysters with recurvate valves, named\r\nGryphææ, and of reptiles, which are remarkable on account of their\r\nforms and structures.\r\n\r\nLarge beds of sand and sandstone, often presenting vegetable\r\nimpressions, support all these Jura deposits, and are themselves\r\nsupported by a limestone, the innumerable shells and zoophytes\r\ncontained in which induced Werner to give it the much too general\r\nname of _Shell-limestone_, and which is separated by other beds of\r\nsandstone, of the kind denominated _variegated_ sandstone, from a\r\nstill older limestone, which has been not less improperly called\r\n_Alpine limestone_, because it composes the High Alps of the Tyrol;\r\nbut which also shews itself at the surface in the eastern provinces\r\nof France, and in the whole southern part of Germany.\r\n\r\nIn this shell-limestone are deposited great masses of gypsum and rich\r\nbeds of salt; and under it are found the thin beds of copper-slates\r\nso rich in fishes, among which there are also fresh-water reptiles.\r\nThe copper-slate rests upon a red sandstone, to the epoch of which\r\nbelong those famous deposits of coal, which supply the present\r\ninhabitants of the civilized countries of Europe with fuel, and are\r\nthe remains of the first vegetable productions with which the face\r\nof the globe was adorned. We learn from the trunks of ferns, whose\r\nimpressions they have preserved, how different these ancient forests\r\nhave been from ours.\r\n\r\nWe then quickly come to those transition formations, in which\r\nprimeval nature, nature dead and purely mineral, seems to have\r\ndisputed the empire with organising nature. Black limestones, and\r\nschists which present only crustacea and shells of kinds now extinct,\r\nalternate with remains of primitive formations, and announce our\r\nhaving arrived at those formations, the oldest with which we are\r\nacquainted, those ancient foundations of the present envelop of the\r\nglobe, the marbles and primitive slates, the gneisses, and, lastly,\r\nthe granites.\r\n\r\nSuch is the precise enumeration of the successive masses with which\r\nnature has enveloped the globe. The positive geological information\r\npresented by it, has been obtained, by combining the knowledge\r\nfurnished by mineralogy with that presented by the sciences connected\r\nwith organic existence. This order, so new and so interesting\r\nin facts, has only been acquired by geology, since it preferred\r\npositive knowledge, furnished by observation, to fanciful systems,\r\ncontradictory conjectures regarding the first origin of the globe,\r\nand all those phenomena, which, having no resemblance to what\r\nactually takes place in nature, could neither find in it, for their\r\nexplanation, materials nor touchstone. A few years ago, the greater\r\nnumber of geologists might have been compared to historians, who,\r\nin writing the history of France, should have interested themselves\r\nonly about the events which had taken place among the Gauls before\r\nthe time of Julius Cesar. In composing their romances, however, these\r\nhistorians would have taken advantage of their knowledge of posterior\r\nfacts; and the geologists of whom I speak, absolutely neglected the\r\nposterior facts, which could alone have reflected some light upon the\r\ndarkness of preceding times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enumeration of the Fossil Animals recognised by the Author._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn concluding this discourse, there only remains for me now to\r\npresent the result of my own researches, or, in other words, a\r\ngeneral account of my great work. I shall enumerate the animals which\r\nI have discovered, in the inverse order of that which I have followed\r\nin my enumeration of the formations. By proceeding deeper and deeper\r\ninto the series of strata, I there rose in the series of epochs. I\r\nshall now take the oldest formations,--make known the animals which\r\nthey contain,--and, passing from one epoch to another, point out\r\nthose which successively make their appearance in proportion as we\r\napproach the present time.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that zoophytes, mollusca, and certain crustacea, begin\r\nto appear in the Transition formations; perhaps there may even at\r\nthat period be bones and skeletons of fishes; but we do not by any\r\nmeans observe at so early a period remains of animals which live on\r\nland, and respire air in its ordinary state.\r\n\r\nThe great beds of coal, and the trunks of palms and ferns of which\r\nthey preserve the impressions, although they afford evidence of the\r\nexistence of dry land, and of a vegetation no longer confined to the\r\nwaters, do not yet shew bones of quadrupeds, not even of oviparous\r\nquadrupeds.\r\n\r\nIt is only a little above this, in the bituminous copper-slates, that\r\nwe see the first traces of them; and, what is very remarkable, the\r\nfirst quadrupeds are reptiles of the family of lizards, very much\r\nresembling the large monitors which live at the present day in the\r\ntorrid zone. Several individuals of this kind have been found in the\r\nmines of Thuringia[247], among innumerable fishes of a genus now\r\nunknown, but which, from its relations to the genera of our days,\r\nappears to have lived in fresh water. Every body knows that the\r\nmonitors are also fresh water animals.\r\n\r\nA little higher is the limestone called Alpine, and resting upon it\r\nthe shell-limestone, so rich in entrochites and encrinites, which\r\nforms the basis of a great part of Germany and Lorraine.\r\n\r\nIn it have been found skeletons of a very large sea-tortoise, the\r\nshells of which might have been from six to eight feet in length; and\r\nthose of another oviparous quadruped of the family of lizards, of a\r\nlarge size, and with a very sharp muzzle[248].\r\n\r\nRising still through sandstones, which present only vegetable\r\nimpressions of large arundinaceæ, bamboos, palms, and other\r\nmonocotyledonous plants, we come to the different strata of the\r\ndeposit which has been named the Jura limestone, on account of its\r\nforming the principal nucleus of that chain of mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the class of Reptiles assumes its full development,\r\nand shews itself under the most varied forms and gigantic sizes.\r\n\r\nThe middle part, which is composed of oolites and lias, or of grey\r\nsandstone containing gryphites, contains the remains of two genera,\r\nthe most extraordinary of all, which have combined the characters of\r\nthe class of oviparous quadrupeds with organs of motion similar to\r\nthose of the cetacea.\r\n\r\nThe _ichthyosaurus_[249], discovered by Sir Everard Home, has the\r\nhead of a lizard, but prolonged into an attenuated muzzle, armed with\r\nconical and pointed teeth; enormous eyes, the sclerotica of which is\r\nstrengthened by a frame consisting of bony pieces; a spine composed\r\nof flat vertebræ, of a depressed circular form, and concave on both\r\nsurfaces like those of fishes; slender ribs; a sternum and clavicles\r\nlike those of lizards and ornithorynchi; a small and weak pelvis;\r\nand four limbs, of which the humeri and femurs are short and thick,\r\nwhile the other bones are flattened, and closely set like the stones\r\nin a pavement, so as to form, when enveloped with the skin, fins of a\r\nsingle piece, almost incapable of bending; analogous, in short, both\r\nas to use and organization, to those of cetacea. These reptiles have\r\nlived in the sea; on shore, they could only at most have crept in the\r\nhobbling manner of seals; at the same time after they have respired\r\nelastic air.\r\n\r\nThe remains of four species have been found:\r\n\r\nThe most extensively distributed (_I. communis_) has blunt conical\r\nteeth; its length sometimes exceeds twenty feet.\r\n\r\nThe second (_I. platyodon_), which is at least as large as the\r\nformer, has compressed teeth, with round and bulging roots.\r\n\r\nThe third (_I. tenuirostris_), has slender and pointed teeth, and the\r\nmuzzle thin and elongated.\r\n\r\nThe fourth (_I. intermedius_), is, as its name implies, intermediate\r\nbetween the last species and the common, with respect to the form of\r\nits teeth. The two latter species do not attain half the size of the\r\ntwo first.\r\n\r\nThe _plesiosaurus_, discovered by Mr Conybeare, must have appeared\r\nstill more monstrous than the ichthyosaurus. It had the same limbs,\r\nbut somewhat more elongated and more flexible; its shoulder and\r\npelvis were more robust; its vertebræ had more of the forms and\r\narticulations of the lizards; but what distinguished it from all\r\noviparous and viviparous quadrupeds, was a slender neck as long as\r\nits body, composed of thirty and odd vertebræ, a number greater than\r\nthat of the neck of any other animal, rising from the trunk like the\r\nbody of a serpent, and terminating in a very small head, in which all\r\nthe essential characters of that of the lizard family are observed.\r\n\r\nIf any thing could justify those hydras and other monsters, the\r\nfigures of which are so often presented in the monuments of the\r\nmiddle ages, it would incontestibly be this plesiosaurus.[250]\r\n\r\nFive species are already known, of which the most generally\r\ndistributed (_P. dolichodeirus_) attains a length of more than twenty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA second species (_P. recentior_), found in more modern strata, has\r\nthe vertebræ flatter.\r\n\r\nA third (_P. carinatus_) shews a ridge on the under surface of its\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\nA fourth, and lastly a fifth (_P. pentagonus_ and _P. trigonus_),\r\nhave the ribs marked with five and three ridges.[251]\r\n\r\nThese two genera are found everywhere in the lias: they were\r\ndiscovered in England, where this rock is exposed in cliffs of great\r\nextent; but they have also been found since in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nAlong with these had lived two species of Crocodiles, the bones\r\nof which are also found deposited in the lias, among ammonites,\r\nterebratulæ, and other shells of that ancient sea. We have skeletons\r\nof them in our cliffs at Honfleur, where the remains are found, from\r\nwhich I have drawn up their characters.[252]\r\n\r\nOne of these species, the _Long-beaked Gavial_, has the muzzle\r\nlonger, and the head more narrow, than the gavial or long-beaked\r\ncrocodile of the Ganges; the bodies of its vertebræ are convex\r\nbefore, while in our crocodiles of the present day they are so\r\nbehind. It has been found in the lias deposits of Franconia, as well\r\nas in those of France.\r\n\r\nA second species, the _Short-beaked Gavial_, has the muzzle of\r\nordinary length, less attenuated than the gavial of the Ganges, but\r\nmore so than our crocodiles of St Domingo. Its vertebræ are slightly\r\nconcave at each of their extremities.\r\n\r\nBut these crocodiles are not the only ones which have been deposited\r\nin the strata of these secondary limestones.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful oolite quarries of Caen have presented a very\r\nremarkable one, the muzzle of which is as long and more pointed than\r\nthat of the long-beaked gavial, and its head more dilated behind,\r\nwith wider temporal fossæ. Its stony scales, marked with small\r\nround cavities, must have rendered it the best defended of all the\r\ncrocodiles.[253] Its lower teeth are alternately longer and shorter.\r\n\r\nThere is still another in the oolite of England; but there have only\r\nbeen found some portions of its cranium, which do not suffice to\r\nafford a complete idea of it.[254]\r\n\r\nAnother very remarkable genus of reptiles, the remains of which,\r\nalthough they are also found beyond the limits of the lias\r\nconcretion, are especially abundant in the oolite and upper sands, is\r\nthe _megalosaurus_, justly so named, for, along with the forms of the\r\nlizards, and particularly of the monitors, of which it has also the\r\nsharp-edged and dentated teeth, it presents so enormous a size, that\r\nif we suppose it to have possessed the proportions of the monitors,\r\nit must have exceeded seventy feet in length. It was, in fact, a\r\nlizard of the size of a whale.[255] It was discovered by Mr Buckland\r\nin England; but we have it also in France; and in Germany there are\r\nfound bones, if not of the same species, at least of a species which\r\ncan be referred to no other genus. It is to M. Sœmmering that we owe\r\nthe first description of this last. He discovered the bones in strata\r\nlying above the oolite, in those limestone-schists of Franconia, long\r\ncelebrated for the numerous fossil remains which they furnished to\r\nthe cabinets of the curious, and which will be still more celebrated\r\nfor the services which their employment in lithography render to the\r\narts and sciences.\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles continue to make their appearance in these schists,\r\nand always of the long-muzzled or rostrated kind. M. de Sœmmering\r\nhas described one (the _Crocodilus priscus_), the entire skeleton of\r\na small individual of which was found nearly in as good a state of\r\npreservation, as it could have been in our cabinets.[256] It is one\r\nof those which most resemble the present gavial of the Ganges; the\r\nanterior or united part of its lower jaw, however, is less elongated;\r\nits lower teeth are alternately and regularly longer and shorter. It\r\nhas ten vertebræ in the tail.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable animals which these limestone slates contain,\r\nare the flying lizards, which I have named _Pterodactyli_.\r\n\r\nThey are reptiles whose principal characters are, a very short tail,\r\na very long neck, the muzzle much elongated, and armed with sharp\r\nteeth; the legs also long, and one of the toes of the anterior\r\nextremity excessively elongated, having probably served for the\r\nattachment of a membrane adapted for supporting them in the air,\r\naccompanied with four other toes of ordinary size, terminated by\r\nhooked claws. One of these strange animals, whose appearance would be\r\nfrightful did they occur alive at the present day, may have been of\r\nthe size of a thrush[257], the other of that of a common bat[258];\r\nbut it would appear from some fragments that larger species had\r\nexisted[259].\r\n\r\nA little above the limestone slates is found the nearly homogeneous\r\nlimestone of the Jura ridges. It also contains bones, but always of\r\nreptiles, crocodiles, and fresh-water tortoises, of which a vast\r\nquantity is found in particular in the neighbourhood of Soleure.\r\nThey have been very carefully searched for by M. Hugi; and, from the\r\nfragments which he has already collected, it is easy to recognise\r\na considerable number of Fresh-water Tortoises, or Emydes, which\r\nfurther discoveries can alone determine, but of which several are\r\nalready distinguished by their size and peculiar forms, from all the\r\nspecies hitherto known[260].\r\n\r\nIt is among these innumerable oviparous quadrupeds, of all sizes and\r\nforms; in the midst of these crocodiles, tortoises, flying reptiles,\r\nhuge megalosauri, and monstrous plesiosauri, that some small\r\nMammifera are said to make their appearance for the first time; and\r\nthe assertion is so far authenticated by the occurrence of jaws, and\r\nsome other bones discovered in England, which undoubtedly belong to\r\nthis class of animals, and particularly to the family of Didelphides,\r\nor to that of the Insectivora.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be supposed, that the stoney matters which encrust\r\nthese bones, owe their origin to some local recomposition, posterior\r\nto the original formation of the strata. However this may be, it is\r\nstill found for a long time that the class of Reptiles predominates.\r\n\r\nThe ferruginous sands, placed in England above the chalk, contain\r\nabundance of crocodiles, tortoises, megalosauri, and especially a\r\nreptile which presents a character quite peculiar, in as much as its\r\nteeth appear worn, like those of our herbivorous mammifera.\r\n\r\nTo Mr Mantell of Lewes, in Sussex, we are indebted for the\r\ndiscovery of this latter animal, as well as of other large reptiles\r\nbelonging to the sands lying beneath the chalk. He has named it\r\n_Iguanodon_[261].\r\n\r\nIn the chalk itself there are only reptiles to be seen: there are\r\nfound in it remains of tortoises and crocodiles. The famous tufaceous\r\nquarries of the mountain of St Peter, near Maestricht, which belong\r\nto the chalk formation, along with very large sea tortoises, and a\r\nmultitude of marine shells and zoophytes, have afforded a genus of\r\nlizards not less gigantic than the megalosaurus, which has become\r\ncelebrated by the researches of Camper, and the figures which Faujas\r\nhas given of its bones, in his history of that mountain.\r\n\r\nIt was upwards of five and twenty feet long; its large jaws were\r\narmed with very strong conical teeth, a little arcuate, and marked\r\nwith a ridge, and it had also some of these teeth in the palate.\r\nUpwards of a hundred and thirty vertebræ were counted in its spine;\r\nthey were convex before, and concave behind. Its tail was deep and\r\nflat, and formed a large vertical oar (or organ of swimming).[262] Mr\r\nConybeare has recently proposed to name it _Mosasaurus_.\r\n\r\nThe clays and lignites which cover the upper part of the chalk, I\r\nhave only found to contain crocodiles[263]; and I have every reason\r\nto think that the lignites which in Switzerland have afforded beaver\r\nand mastodon bones, belong to a later epoch. Nor has it been at an\r\nearlier period than that of the coarse limestone which rests upon\r\nthese clays that I have begun to find bones of mammifera; and still\r\ndo they all belong to marine mammifera, to dolphins of unknown\r\nspecies, lamantins and morses.\r\n\r\nAmong the dolphins, there is one, the muzzle of which, more elongated\r\nthan that of any known species, has the lower jaw united in a\r\nconsiderable part of its length, nearly as in a gavial. It was found\r\nnear Dax by the late president of Borda[264].\r\n\r\nAnother species, from the cliffs of the Department de l’Orne, has the\r\nmuzzle also long, but somewhat differently shaped[265].\r\n\r\nThe entire genus of lamantins is at the present day confined to\r\nthe seas of the torrid zone; and that of the morses, of which only\r\na single living species is known to exist, is limited to the frozen\r\nocean. Yet we find skeletons of these two genera side by side in the\r\ncoarse limestone strata of the middle of France; and this association\r\nof species, the nearest allied to which are, at the present day,\r\nfound in opposite zones, will again make its appearance more than\r\nonce as we proceed.\r\n\r\nOur fossil lamantins differ from those known to exist at present, in\r\nhaving the head more elongated, and of a different form[266]. Their\r\nribs, which are easily recognised by their being of a thick and\r\nrounded form, and of dense texture, are not of rare occurrence in our\r\ndifferent provinces.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the fossil morse, small fragments only have as yet\r\nbeen found of it, which are insufficient for characterising the\r\nspecies[267].\r\n\r\nIt is only in the strata that have succeeded the coarse limestone,\r\nor, at most, those which may have been of contemporaneous formation\r\nwith it, but deposited in fresh-water lakes, that the class of land\r\nmammifera begins to shew itself in any quantity.\r\n\r\nI consider as belonging to the same period, and as having lived\r\ntogether, but perhaps in different spots, the animals whose bones are\r\ndeposited in the molasse and old gravel beds of the south of France;\r\nin the gypsums mixed with limestone, such as those of Paris and Aix;\r\nand in the fresh-water marly deposits covered with marine beds, of\r\nAlsace, the country of Orleans and of Berry.\r\n\r\nThis animal population possesses a very remarkable character in\r\nthe abundance and variety of certain genera of pachydermata, which\r\nare entirely awanting among the quadrupeds of our days, and whose\r\ncharacters have more or less resemblance to those of the tapirs, the\r\nrhinoceroses, and camels.\r\n\r\nThese genera, the entire discovery of which is my own, are the\r\n_palæotheria_, _lophiodonta_, _anaplotheria_, _anthracotheria_,\r\n_cheropotami_, and _adapis_.\r\n\r\nThe _Palæotheria_ have resembled the tapirs in their general form,\r\nand in that of the head, particularly in the shortness of the bones\r\nof the nose, which announces that they have had a small proboscis\r\nlike the tapirs, and, lastly, in their having six incisors and two\r\ncanine teeth in each jaw; but they have resembled the rhinoceros in\r\ntheir grinders, of which those of the upper jaw have been square,\r\nwith prominent ridges of various configuration, and those of the\r\nlower jaw in the form of double crescents, as well as in their feet,\r\nall of which have been divided into three toes, while in the tapirs\r\nthe fore feet have four.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most extensively diffused genera and most numerous\r\nin species that occur in the deposits of this period.\r\n\r\nOur gypsum quarries in the neighbourhood of Paris are full of them.\r\nBones of seven distinct species are found there. The first (_P.\r\nmagnum_) is as large as a horse. The three next are of the size of a\r\nhog, but one of them (_P. medium_) has narrow and long feet, another\r\n(_P. crassum_) has the feet broader, and a third (_P. latum_) has\r\nthem still broader, and especially shorter. The fifth species (_P.\r\ncurtum_), which is of the size of a sheep, is much lower, and has\r\nthe feet still broader and shorter in proportion than the last. The\r\nsixth (_P. minus_) is of the size of a small sheep, and has long and\r\nslender feet, the lateral toes of which are shorter than the rest.\r\nThe seventh (_P. minimum_), which is not larger than a hare, has also\r\nthe feet slender[268].\r\n\r\nPalæotheria have also been found in other districts of France: at Puy\r\nin Valey, in strata of gypseous marl, a species (_P. velaunum_)[269],\r\nmuch resembling (_P. medium_), but differing from it in the form of\r\nits lower jaw; in the neighbourhood of Orleans, in strata of marly\r\nrock, a species (_P. aurelianense_)[270], which is distinguished from\r\nthe others by having the re-entering angle of the crescent of its\r\nlower grinders split into a double point, and by some differences\r\nin the necks of the upper grinders; near Issel, in a bed of gravel\r\nor molasse, along the declivities of the Black Mountain, a species\r\n(_P. isselanum_)[271], which has the same characters as the Orleans\r\nspecies, but is of smaller size. It is more particularly, however, in\r\nthe molasse of the Department of the Dordogne, that the palæotherium\r\noccurs not less abundantly than in our gypsum deposits in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Duke Decaze has discovered in the quarries of a single field,\r\nbones of three species which appear different from all those of our\r\nneighbourhood[272].\r\n\r\nThe _Lophiodons_ approach still somewhat nearer to the tapirs than\r\nthe palæotheria do, inasmuch as their lower false grinders have\r\ntransverse necks like those of the tapirs.\r\n\r\nThey differ, however, from these latter, in having the fore ones more\r\nsimple, the backmost of all with three necks, and the upper ones\r\nrhomboidal, and marked with ridges very much resembling those of the\r\nrhinoceros.\r\n\r\nWe are still ignorant what the form of their snout, and the number\r\nof their toes, may have been. I have discovered not less than twelve\r\nspecies of this genus, all in France, deposited in marly rocks of\r\nfresh-water formation, and filled with lymneæ and planorbes, which\r\nare shells peculiar to pools and marshes.\r\n\r\nThe largest species is found near Orleans, in the same quarry as the\r\npalæotheria; it approaches the rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller species in the same place; a third occurs at\r\nMontpellier; a fourth near Laon; two near Buchsweiler in Alsace;\r\nfive near Argenton in Berry; and one of the three occurs again near\r\nIssel, where there are also two others. There is also a large one\r\nnear Gannat[273].\r\n\r\nThese species differ from each other in size, the smallest being\r\nscarcely so large as a lamb of three months, and in various\r\ncircumstances connected with the form of their teeth, which it would\r\nbe too tedious and minute to detail here.\r\n\r\nThe _Anoplotheria_ have hitherto been discovered nowhere but in\r\nthe gypsum quarries of the neighbourhood of Paris. They have two\r\ncharacters which are observed in no other animal; feet with two\r\ntoes, the metacarpal and metatarsal bones of which are separate in\r\ntheir whole length, and do not unite into a single piece, as in the\r\nruminantia; and teeth placed in a continuous series without any\r\ninterruption. Man alone has the teeth so placed in mutual contiguity,\r\nwithout any interval. Those of the anaplotheria consist of six\r\nincisors in each jaw, a canine tooth and six grinders on each side,\r\nboth above and below; their canine teeth are short and similar to\r\nthe outer incisors. The three first grinders are compressed; the\r\nfour others are, in the upper jaw, square, with transverse ridges,\r\nand a small cone between them; and, in the lower jaw, in the form of\r\na double crescent, but without neck at the base. The last has three\r\ncrescents. Their head is of an oblong form, and does not indicate\r\nthat the muzzle has terminated either in a proboscis or a snout.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary genus, which can be compared to nothing in living\r\nnature, is subdivided into three subgenera: the _Anaplotheria_,\r\nproperly so called, the anterior molares of which are still pretty\r\nthick, and the posterior ones of the lower jaw have their crescents\r\nwith a simple ridge; the _Xiphodons_, of which the anterior molares\r\nare thin and sharp on the edges, and the under posterior, have,\r\ndirectly opposite the concavity of each of their crescents, a point,\r\nwhich, on being worn, also assumes the form of a crescent, so that\r\nthen the crescents are double as in the ruminantia; lastly, the\r\n_Dichobunes_, the outer crescents of which are also pointed at the\r\nbeginning, and which have thus points disposed in pairs upon their\r\nlower posterior grinders.\r\n\r\nThe most common species in our gypsum quarries (_An. commune_), is\r\nan animal of the height of a boar, but much more elongated, and\r\nfurnished with a very long and very thick tail, so that altogether it\r\nhas nearly the proportion of the otter, but larger. It is probable\r\nthat it was well fitted for swimming, and frequented the lakes in the\r\nbottom of which its bones have been incrusted by the gypsum which was\r\ndeposited there. We have one a little smaller, but in other respects\r\npretty similar (_An. secundarium_.)\r\n\r\nWe are as yet acquainted with only one _xiphodon_, which, however,\r\nis a very remarkable animal: it is that which I have named _An.\r\ngracile_. It is slender, and delicately formed, like the prettiest\r\ngazelle.\r\n\r\nThere is one _dichobune_, nearly of the size of a hare, to which\r\nI have given the name of _An. leporinum_. Besides its subgeneric\r\ncharacters, it differs from the anaplotheria and xiphodons, in having\r\ntwo small and slender toes on each foot, at the sides of the two\r\nlarge toes.\r\n\r\nWe do not know if these lateral toes exist in the two other\r\ndichobunes, which are small, and scarcely exceed in size the common\r\nGuinea pig[274].\r\n\r\nThe genus of _Anthracotheria_ is in some degree intermediate between\r\nthe palæotheria, anaplotheria, and hogs. I have named it so, because\r\ntwo of its species have been found in the lignites of Cadibona, near\r\nSavone. The first approached the rhinoceros in size; the second was\r\nmuch smaller. They have also been found in Alsace, and in the Vélay.\r\nTheir grinders are similar to those of the anaplotheria; but they\r\nhave projecting canine teeth[275].\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cheropotamus_ is found in our gypsum deposits, where it\r\naccompanies the palæotheria and anaplotheria, but where it is of\r\nmuch rarer occurrence. Its posterior grinders are square above,\r\nrectangular below, and have four large conical eminences surrounded\r\nwith smaller ones. The anterior molares are short cones, slightly\r\ncompressed, and with two roots. Its canine teeth are small. Neither\r\nits incisors nor its feet are yet known. I possess only one species,\r\nwhich is of the size of a Siam hog[276].\r\n\r\nThe genus _Adapis_ has also but one species, which is at most of the\r\nsize of a rabbit: it is also from our gypsum quarries, and must have\r\nbeen nearly allied to the anaplotheria[277].\r\n\r\nWe have thus nearly forty species of pachydermata belonging to genera\r\nnow entirely extinct, and presenting forms and proportions to which\r\nthere is nothing that can be compared in the present animal kingdom,\r\nexcepting two tapirs and a daman.\r\n\r\nThis large number of pachydermata is so much the more remarkable,\r\nthat the ruminantia, which are at present so numerous in the genera\r\nof deer and antelopes, and which attain so great a size in those of\r\nthe oxen, giraffes, and camels, scarcely make their appearance in the\r\ndeposits of which we are speaking.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the slightest trace of them in our gypsum quarries;\r\nand all that has come to my hands consists of some fragments of a\r\ndeer, of the size of the roe, but of a different species, collected\r\namong the palæotheria of Orleans[278]; and of one or two other small\r\nfragments, from Switzerland, which, however, are perhaps of doubtful\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nBut our pachydermata have not for all this been the only inhabitants\r\nof the countries in which they lived. In our gypsum deposits, at\r\nleast, we find along with them carnivora, glires, several sorts of\r\nbirds, crocodiles, and tortoises; and these two latter genera also\r\naccompany them in the molasse sandstones and marly deposits of the\r\nmiddle and south of France.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the carnivora, I place a Bat, very recently\r\ndiscovered at Montmartre, and which belongs to the proper genus\r\nVespertilio[279]. The existence of this genus, at an epoch so remote,\r\nis so much the more surprising, that, neither in this formation, nor\r\nin those which have succeeded it, have I seen any other trace, either\r\nof cheiroptera or of quadrumana: no bone or tooth of either monkey\r\nor maki has ever presented itself to me, in the course of my long\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nMontmartre has also furnished the bones of a fox different from ours,\r\nand which also differs from the jackals, isatises, and the various\r\nspecies of foxes peculiar to America[280]; those of a carnivorous\r\nanimal allied to the raccoons and coaties, but larger than any known\r\nspecies[281]; those of a particular species of civet[282]; and of\r\ntwo or three other carnivora, which it has not been possible to\r\ndetermine, from the want of tolerably complete portions.\r\n\r\nWhat is still more remarkable, is, that there are skeletons of a\r\nsmall sarigue, allied to the marmose, but different, and consequently\r\nof an animal belonging to a genus which is at the present day\r\nconfined to the New World[283]. Skeletons of two small glires, of the\r\ngenus myoxus[284], and a skull belonging to the genus sciurus[285],\r\nhave also been collected.\r\n\r\nOur gypsum deposits are more fertile in bones of birds than any\r\nof the other strata either anterior or posterior to it. Entire\r\nskeletons, and parts of at least ten species belonging to all the\r\norders, are found there[286].\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles of the period in question approach our common\r\ncrocodiles in the form of the head, while, in the deposits of the\r\nJura period, we find only species allied to the gavial.\r\n\r\nA species has been found at Argenton, which is remarkable for its\r\ncompressed, sharp teeth, having their edges dentated like those of\r\ncertain monitors[287]. Some remains of it also occur in our gypsum\r\nquarries[288].\r\n\r\nThe tortoises of this period are all fresh-water ones: some of\r\nthem belong to the subgenus _Emys_; and there are species, both at\r\nMontmartre[289], and still more especially in the molasse sandstones\r\nof the Dordogne[290], which are larger than any living species known;\r\nthe others are Trionyces or soft tortoises[291]. This genus, which\r\nis easily distinguished by the vermiculate surface of the bones of\r\nits shell, and which at present exists only in the rivers of warm\r\ncountries, such as the Nile, the Ganges, and the Orinoko, has\r\nbeen very abundant in the places where the palæotheria lived. Vast\r\nquantities of its remains are found at Montmartre[292], and in the\r\nmolasse sandstones of the Dordogne, and the other gravel deposits of\r\nthe south of France.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water lakes, around which these various animals have lived,\r\nand which had received their bones, nourished, besides the tortoises\r\nand crocodiles, some fishes and testaceous mollusca. All that have\r\nbeen collected of these two classes of animals, are as foreign to\r\nour climate, and even as much unknown in our present waters, as the\r\npalæotheria, and other quadrupeds which were coeval with them[293].\r\n\r\nThe fishes have even in part belonged to unknown genera.\r\n\r\nHence, it cannot be doubted that this race of inhabitants, which\r\nmight be termed the population of the middle age, this first great\r\nproduction of mammifera, has been entirely destroyed; and, in fact,\r\nin all places where remains of them have been discovered, there are\r\ngreat deposits of marine formation above them, so that the sea has\r\noverwhelmed the countries which these races inhabited, and has\r\nrested upon them during a long period of time.\r\n\r\nHave the countries inundated by it at this period been of great\r\nextent? This is a question which the examination of those ancient\r\ndeposits formed in their lakes do not enable us to answer.\r\n\r\nTo this period I refer the gypsum beds of Paris and those of Aix,\r\nseveral quarries of marly stones, and the molasse sandstones,\r\nat least those of the south of France. I am of opinion that we\r\nshould also refer to it the portions of the molasse sandstones of\r\nSwitzerland, and of the lignites of Liguria and Alsace, in which\r\nquadrupeds are found of the families enumerated above; but I do\r\nnot find that any of these animals have been also found in other\r\ncountries. The fossil bones of Germany, England, and Italy, are all\r\neither older or newer than those of which we have been speaking, and\r\nbelong either to those ancient races of reptiles of the juraic and\r\ncopper-slate formations, or to the deposits of the last universal\r\ninundation, the diluvial formations.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, authorised to believe, until the contrary be\r\nproved, that at the period when these numerous pachydermata lived,\r\nthe globe had only presented for their habitation a small number of\r\nplains sufficiently fertile for them to multiply there, and that\r\nperhaps these plains were insulated regions, separated by pretty\r\nlarge spaces of elevated chains, in which we do not find that our\r\nanimals have left any traces of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe researches of M. Adolphe Brongniart have also made known to us\r\nthe nature of the vegetables which covered those countries. In the\r\nsame strata with our palæotheria, there have been found trunks of\r\npalms, and many others of those beautiful plants whose genera now\r\nonly grow in warm climates. Palms, crocodiles, and trionyces always\r\noccur in greater or less abundance wherever our ancient pachydermata\r\nare found[294].\r\n\r\nThe sea which had covered these lands and destroyed their animals,\r\nleft large deposits, which still form at the present day, at no great\r\ndepth, the basis of our great plains: it had then retired anew, and\r\nleft immense surfaces to a new population, whose remains are found in\r\nthe sandy and muddy deposits of all countries known.\r\n\r\nIt is to this deposition from the sea, made in a state of quiet,\r\nthat certain fossil cetacea, very much resembling those of our own\r\ndays, should, in my opinion, be referred;--a dolphin, allied to\r\nour epaulard[295], and a whale very like our rorquals[296], both\r\ndiscovered in Lombardy by M. Cortesi; a large head of a whale found\r\nwithin the very precincts of Paris[297], and described by Lamanon\r\nand Daubenton; and an entirely new genus, which I have discovered\r\nand named _Ziphius_, and which already contains three species. It is\r\nallied to the cachalots and hyperoodons[298].\r\n\r\nIn the extinct population which fills our alluvial and superficial\r\nstrata, and which has lived upon the deposit just alluded to,\r\nthere are no longer either palæotheria or anaplotheria, or, in in\r\nfact, any of those singular genera. The pachydermata, however,\r\nstill predominate; and these are of a gigantic size, elephants,\r\nrhinoceroses, and hippopotami, accompanied with innumerable horses\r\nand several large ruminantia. Carnivorous animals of the size of\r\nthe lion, tiger, and hyena, had desolated this new animal kingdom.\r\nIn general, its character, even in the extreme north, and on the\r\nedges of the present frozen ocean, was similar to that which the\r\ntorrid zone alone now presents, and yet there was no species in it\r\nabsolutely the same as any of those which are found alive at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these animals is the species of elephant named\r\n_mammoth_ by the Russians (the _Elephas primigenius_ of Blumenbach),\r\nwhich was fifteen or eighteen feet high, and was covered with coarse\r\nred wool, and long, stiff, black hairs, which formed a mane along\r\nits back. Its enormous tusks were implanted in alveolæ longer than\r\nthose of the elephants of the present day; but in other respects it\r\nwas pretty similar to the Indian elephant[299]. It has left thousands\r\nof its carcases from Spain to the shores of Siberia, and it has been\r\nfound in the whole of North America; so that it had been distributed\r\non both sides of the Atlantic, if, indeed, that ocean had existed\r\nin its time, in the place which it occupies at present. It is well\r\nknown that its tusks are still so well preserved in cold countries,\r\nas to be applied to the same uses as fresh ivory; and, as we have\r\nalready remarked, individuals of it have been found with their flesh,\r\nskin, and hair, which had remained frozen since the last general\r\ncatastrophe. The Tartars and Chinese have imagined it to be an animal\r\nwhich lives under ground, and perishes whenever it perceives the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAfter the mammoth, and almost its equal in size, came also in the\r\ncountries which form the two presently existing continents, the\r\n_narrow toothed mastodon_, which resembled the elephant, and was\r\narmed like it with enormous tusks, but with tusks covered with\r\nenamel, shorter legs, and whose mamillated grinders, invested with a\r\nthick and shining enamel, have long furnished what has been called\r\noccidental turquoise[300].\r\n\r\nIts remains, which are pretty common in the temperate parts of\r\nEurope, are not so much so towards the north; but it has also been\r\nfound in the mountains of South America, along with two allied\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn North America immense quantities of the remains of the _great\r\nmastodon_ have been found, a species larger than the preceding, as\r\nhigh in proportion as the elephant, with equally huge tusks, and\r\nwhose grinders, which are covered over with bristling points, made it\r\nlong be considered as a carnivorous animal[301].\r\n\r\nIts bones were of a large size, and very solid. Even its hoofs\r\nand stomach are said to have been found in a sufficient state of\r\npreservation to be recognisable; and it is asserted that the stomach\r\nwas filled with bruised branches of trees. The Indians imagine that\r\nthe whole race was destroyed by the gods, to prevent them from\r\ndestroying the human species.\r\n\r\nAlong with these enormous pachydermata, lived the two somewhat\r\ninferior genera of the rhinoceroses and hippopotami.\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus of this period was pretty common in the countries\r\nwhich now form France, Germany and England, and was particularly so\r\nin Italy. It so closely resembled the present African species, that\r\nit is only by an attentive comparison that it can be distinguished\r\nfrom it[302].\r\n\r\nThere was also at this time a small species of hippopotamus of the\r\nsize of the wild boar, to which there is nothing similar at present\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nThere were at least three species of Rhinoceros of large size, all of\r\nthem two-horned.\r\n\r\nThe most common species in Germany and England (my _Rh.\r\ntichorhinus_), and which, like the elephant, is found even to the\r\nshores of the frozen sea, where it has also left entire individuals,\r\nhad the head elongated, the bones of the nose very robust and\r\nsupported by an osseous and not merely cartilaginous septum narium,\r\nand, lastly, wanted incisors[303].\r\n\r\nAnother species, of rarer occurrence, and peculiar to more temperate\r\nclimates (_Rh. incisivus_)[304], had incisors like our present\r\nrhinoceroses of the East Indies, and, in particular, resembled that\r\nof Sumatra[305]; its distinctive characters are derived from some\r\ndifferences in the form of the head.\r\n\r\nThe third species (_Rh. leptorhinus_) had no incisors, like the first\r\nand like the present rhinoceros of the Cape; but it was distinguished\r\nby a more pointed muzzle and more slender limbs[306]. The bones of\r\nthis species have been found more especially in Italy, in the same\r\nstrata with those of elephants, mastodons, and hippopotami.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth species still (_Rh. minutus_), furnished, like\r\nthe second, with incisors, but of a much smaller size, and scarcely\r\nlarger than a hog[307]. It was undoubtedly rare, for the remains of\r\nit have only as yet been found in some places in France.\r\n\r\nTo those four genera of large pachydermata, is added a Tapir, which\r\nequalled them in size, and was consequently twice, perhaps three\r\ntimes, as large in its linear dimensions as the American Tapir[308].\r\nIts teeth have been found in several parts of France and Germany;\r\nand almost always accompanying those of rhinoceroses, mastodons, or\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\nAlong with these there is still associated, but as it would seem in a\r\nvery small number of places, a large pachydermatous animal, of which\r\nthe lower jaw alone has been found, and whose teeth are of the form\r\nof double crescents, and undulated. M. Fischer, who discovered it\r\namong bones from Siberia, has named it _Elasmotherium_[309].\r\n\r\nThe Horse genus also existed in those times[310]. Its teeth accompany\r\nin thousands the remains of the animals which we have just mentioned,\r\nin almost all their localities; but it is not possible to say\r\nwhether it was one of the species now existing or not, because the\r\nskeletons of these species are so like each other, that they cannot\r\nbe distinguished by the mere comparison of isolated fragments.\r\n\r\nThe Ruminantia were now greatly more numerous than at the epoch of\r\nthe Palæotheria; their numerical proportion must even have differed\r\nvery little from what it is at present; but we are certain of several\r\nspecies which were different.\r\n\r\nThis may, in particular, be said with much certainty of a deer\r\nexceeding even the elk in size, which is common in the marl deposits\r\nand peat-bogs of Ireland and England, and of which remains have also\r\nbeen dug up in France, Germany, and Italy, where they were found in\r\nthe same strata with bones of elephants. Its wide, palmated, and\r\nbranched horns, measure so much as twelve or fourteen feet from one\r\npoint to the other, following the curvatures[311].\r\n\r\nThe distinction is not so clear with regard to the bones of deer\r\nand oxen, which have been collected in certain caverns, and in\r\nthe fissures of certain rocks. They are sometimes, and especially\r\nin the caverns of England, accompanied with bones of elephants,\r\nrhinoceroses, and hippopotami, and with those of a hyena, which also\r\noccurs in several strata of transported matter, along with these same\r\npachydermata. They are consequently of the same age; but it remains\r\nnot the less difficult to say in what respect they differ from the\r\noxen and deer of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe fissures of the rocks of Gibraltar, Cette, Nice, Uliveta near\r\nPisa, and other places on the shores of the Mediterranean, are\r\nfilled with a red and hard cement, which envelopes fragments of rock\r\nand fresh-water shells, and numerous bones of quadrupeds, the greater\r\npart fractured. These concretions are termed osseous brecciæ. The\r\nbones which they contain sometimes present characters sufficient to\r\nprove that they have belonged to unknown animals, or at least to\r\nanimals foreign to Europe. There are found, for example, four species\r\nof deer, three of which have characters in their teeth, which are\r\nonly observed in the deer of the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThere is a fifth near Verona, the horns of which exceed in magnitude\r\nthose of the Canadian deer[312].\r\n\r\nThere also occur, in certain places, along with bones of\r\nrhinoceroses, and other quadrupeds of this period, those of a deer so\r\nmuch resembling the reindeer, that it would be difficult to assign\r\ndistinctive characters to it; a circumstance which is so much the\r\nmore extraordinary, that the reindeer is at the present day confined\r\nto the coldest regions of the north, while the whole genus of\r\nrhinoceroses belongs to the torrid zone.[313]\r\n\r\nThere exist in the strata of which we speak, remains of a species\r\nvery similar to the fallow-deer, but a third larger,[314] and\r\nprodigious quantities of horns, very much resembling those of\r\nour present stag[315], as well as bones, very like those of the\r\naurochs[316] and domestic ox[317], two very distinct species, which\r\nhad been erroneously confounded by the naturalists who preceded us.\r\nThe entire heads, however, resembling those of these two animals, as\r\nwell as that of the musk-ox of Canada[318], which have often been\r\nextracted from the earth, do not come from localities sufficiently\r\nwell determined to enable us to assert that these species had been\r\ncontemporaries of the great pachydermata, of which we have made\r\nmention above.\r\n\r\nThe osseous brecciæ of the shores of the Mediterranean have also\r\nafforded two species of _Lagomys_,[319] animals, the genus of\r\nwhich exists at the present day only in Siberia; two species of\r\nrabbits[320], lemmings, and rats of the size of the water-rat and\r\ndomestic mouse[321]. In the caves of England two species are also\r\nfound[322].\r\n\r\nThe osseous brecciæ even contain bones of shrew-mice and lizards[323].\r\n\r\nIn certain sandy strata of Tuscany, there are teeth of a\r\nporcupine[324], and in those of Russia heads of a species of beaver,\r\nlarger than ours, which M. Fischer has named _Trogontherium_[325].\r\n\r\nBut it is more particularly in the class Edentata that these races\r\nof animals belonging to the period before the last assume a size\r\nmuch superior to that of their present congeners, and even rise to a\r\nmagnitude altogether gigantic.\r\n\r\nThe _Megatherium_ unites a part of the generic characters of the\r\narmadilloes, with some of those of the sloths, and is in size equal\r\nto the largest rhinoceros. Its claws must have been of a monstrous\r\nlength, and prodigious strength; its whole skeleton possesses an\r\nexcessive solidity. It has only as yet been found in the sandy strata\r\nof North America[326].\r\n\r\nThe _Megalonyx_ has been very similar to it in its characters, but\r\nhas been somewhat less; its claws much longer and sharper in the\r\nedges. Some bones and entire toes of it have been found in certain\r\ncaves in Virginia, and in an island on the coast of Georgia[327].\r\n\r\nThese two enormous edentata have only hitherto presented their\r\nremains in America; but Europe possesses one of the same class which\r\ndoes not yield to them in magnitude. It is only known by a single\r\nterminal joint of a toe, but this fragment is sufficient to assure us\r\nthat it was very similar to a pangolin or manis, but to a pangolin\r\nof nearly twenty-four feet in length. It lived in the same districts\r\nas the elephants, rhinoceroses, and gigantic tapirs; for its bones\r\nhave been found along with theirs in a sandy deposit in the county of\r\nDarmstadt, not far from the Rhine[328].\r\n\r\nThe osseous brecciæ also contain, but very rarely, bones of\r\ncarnivora[329], which are much more numerous in caverns, that is to\r\nsay, in cavities wider and more complicated than the fissures or\r\nveins containing osseous brecciæ. The Jura chain in particular, is\r\ncelebrated for them in the part of it which extends into Germany,\r\nwhere, for ages past, incredible quantities have been removed and\r\ndestroyed, on account of certain medical virtues which had been\r\nattributed to them, and yet there still remains enough to fill the\r\nmind with astonishment. The principal part of these remains consists\r\nof bones of a very large species of bear (_Ursus spelæus_), which\r\nis characterised by a more prominent forehead than that of any of\r\nour living bears[330]. Along with these bones are found those of\r\ntwo other species of bear (_U. arctoideus_ and _U. priscus_)[331];\r\nthose of a hyena (_H. fossilis_), allied to the spotted hyena of the\r\nCape, but differing from it in the form of its teeth and head[332];\r\nthose of two tigers or panthers[333], of a wolf[334], a fox[335],\r\na glutton[336], as well as of weasels, viverræ, and other small\r\ncarnivora[337].\r\n\r\nHere, also, may be observed that singular association of animals,\r\nthe species resembling which live at the present day in climates so\r\nwidely separated from each other as the Cape, the country of the\r\nspotted hyena, and Lapland, the country of our present gluttons. In\r\nlike manner we have seen in a cave in France, a rhinoceros and a\r\nreindeer by the side of each other.\r\n\r\nBears are of rare occurrence in alluvial strata. Remains of the large\r\nspecies of the caves (_U. spelæus_), are said, however, to have been\r\nfound in Austria and Hainaut; and in Tuscany there are bones of a\r\nparticular species, remarkable for its compressed canine teeth (_U.\r\ncultridens_)[338]. The hyenas are more frequently met with. We have\r\nremains of them in France, found along with bones of elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses. A cave has lately been discovered in England, which\r\ncontained prodigious quantities of them, where they were found of\r\nevery age, and of which the soil presented even their excrements\r\nin a sufficient state of preservation to be easily recognised. It\r\nwould appear that they had long lived there, and that it had been by\r\nthem that the bones of elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, horses,\r\noxen, deer, and various animals of the class of glires, which are\r\nfound along with them, and which bear evident marks of their teeth,\r\nhad been dragged into the cave. But what must have been the soil of\r\nEngland, when these enormous animals lived upon it, and constituted\r\nthe prey of ferocious beasts! These caves contain also bones of\r\ntigers, wolves and foxes; but the remains of bears are of excessively\r\nrare occurrence in them[339].\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, we see that, at the epoch of the animal\r\npopulation which we are now passing under review, the class of\r\ncarnivora was numerous and powerful. It reckoned three bears with\r\nround canine teeth, one with compressed canini, a large tiger or\r\nlion, another feline animal, of the size of the panther, a hyena, a\r\nwolf, a fox, a glutton, a martin or pole-cat, and a weasel.\r\n\r\nThe class of glires, composed in general of weak and small species,\r\nhas been little observed by the collectors of fossil remains; and,\r\nin all cases, where the bones of these animals have been found in\r\nthe strata or deposits of which we speak, they also have presented\r\nunknown species. Such, in particular, is a species of Lagomys found\r\nin the osseous brecciæ of Corsica and Sardinia, somewhat resembling\r\nthe Lagomys alpinus of the high mountains of Siberia: so true is it\r\nthat it is not always in the torrid zone only, that we are to seek\r\nfor the animals which resemble those of this period.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal animals, the remains of which have been\r\nfound in that mass of earth, sand, and mud,--that _Diluvium_, which\r\neverywhere covers our large plains, fills our caverns, and chokes\r\nup the fissures in many of our rocks. They incontestibly formed the\r\npopulation of the continents, at the epoch of the great catastrophe\r\nwhich has destroyed their races, and which has prepared the soil, on\r\nwhich the animals of the present day subsist.\r\n\r\nWhatever resemblance certain of these species bear to those of our\r\ndays, it cannot be disputed that the general mass of this population\r\nhad a very different character, and that the greater part of the\r\nraces which composed it have been utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhat astonishes us is, that, among all these mammifera, the greater\r\nnumber of which have their congeners at the present day in the\r\nwarm parts of the globe, there has not been a single quadrumanous\r\nanimal,--that there has not been collected a single bone or a single\r\ntooth of an ape or monkey, not so much even as a bone or a tooth\r\nbelonging to an extinct species of these animals.\r\n\r\nNor is there any trace of man. All the bones of our species that have\r\nbeen found along with those of which we have been speaking, have\r\noccurred accidentally[340], and their number besides is exceedingly\r\nsmall, which assuredly would not have been the case, if men had then\r\nbeen settled in the countries which these animals inhabited.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, was the human race at this period? Did the last and most\r\nperfect of the works of the Creator nowhere exist? Did the animals\r\nwhich now accompany him upon the globe, and of which there are no\r\ntraces among these fossil remains, surround him? Were the countries\r\nin which he lived with them swallowed up, when those which he now\r\ninhabits, and whose former population may have been destroyed by a\r\ngreat inundation, were laid dry again? These are questions which the\r\nstudy of fossil remains does not enable us to solve, and in this\r\ndiscourse we must not apply for information to other sources.\r\n\r\nThis much is certain, that we are now at least in the midst of a\r\nfourth succession of land animals,--that, after the age of reptiles,\r\nthe age of palæotheria, the age of mammoths, and that of mastodons\r\nand megatheria, has come the age in which the human species, aided\r\nby some domestic animals, peaceably governs and fertilizes the earth,\r\nand that it is only in the deposits formed since the commencement of\r\nthis age, in alluvial matters, peat-bogs, and recent concretions,\r\nthat bones are found in the fossil state, which belong all of them to\r\nknown and still living animals.\r\n\r\nSuch are the human skeletons of Guadaloupe, imbedded in a species\r\nof travertine formed of land shells, slate, and fragments of shells\r\nand madrepores of the neighbouring sea; the bones of oxen, deer,\r\nroes, and beavers, common in peat-bogs, and all the bones of men and\r\ndomestic animals found in the mud and sand deposited by rivers, in\r\nburying grounds, and upon ancient fields of battle.\r\n\r\nNone of these remains belong either to the great deposit formed at\r\nthe time of the last catastrophe, nor to those of preceding ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the birds to which the name of Ibis was given by the ancient\r\nEgyptians._\r\n\r\nEvery body has heard of the Ibis, a bird to which the ancient\r\nEgyptians rendered a religious homage; which they reared within the\r\nprecincts of their temples; allowed to wander unmolested through\r\ntheir towns; whose murderer, even although he had involuntarily\r\nbecome so, was punished with death[341]; which they embalmed with as\r\nmuch care as their parents;--a bird to which they attributed a virgin\r\npurity; an inviolable attachment to their country, of which it was\r\nthe emblem, an attachment so great that it suffered itself to die of\r\nhunger when it was transported elsewhere;--a bird which possessed\r\ninstinct enough to know the increase and waning of the moon, and\r\nto regulate accordingly the quantity of its daily food, and the\r\ndevelopment of its young; which arrested at the frontiers of Egypt\r\nthe serpents which would otherwise have carried destruction into that\r\nsacred land[342], and which inspired them with such terror that they\r\ndreaded its very feathers[343];--a bird, in fine, whose form the gods\r\nwould have assumed, had they been forced to adopt a mortal figure,\r\nand into which Mercury was really transformed, when he had a mind to\r\ntraverse the earth, and instruct men in the sciences and arts.\r\n\r\nNo other animal could have been so easy to recognize as this; for\r\nthere is no other of which the ancients have left us at once, as\r\nof the ibis, excellent descriptions, accurate and even coloured\r\nfigures, and the body itself preserved with its feathers, under the\r\ntriple envelope of a preservative bitumen, thick and close folds of\r\nlinen, and solid and well varnished vases. And yet, of all the modern\r\nauthors who have spoken of the ibis, there is but one, the celebrated\r\nBruce, a traveller more famous for his courage than for the justness\r\nof his opinions in natural history, who has not blundered respecting\r\nthe true species of this bird; and his ideas with regard to this\r\nsubject, however accurate they were, have not even been adopted by\r\nnaturalists[344].\r\n\r\nAfter several changes of opinion respecting the ibis, it was\r\nseemingly agreed, at the period when I published the first edition\r\nof this work, to give the name of Ibis to a bird a native of Africa,\r\nalmost of the size of the stork, with white plumage, having the\r\nquills black, perched upon long red legs, armed with a long arched\r\nbeak, of a pale yellow colour, sharp at its edges, rounded at its\r\nbase, and notched at its point, and whose face is covered with a red\r\nskin destitute of feathers, which do not extend farther forward than\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nSuch is the Ibis of Perrault[345], the Ibis candida of Brisson[346],\r\nthe Ibis blanc d’Egypte of Buffon[347], and the Tantalus Ibis of\r\nLinnæus, in his twelfth edition. It was to this same bird, also, that\r\nBlumenbach, while he avowed that it is of very rare occurrence at the\r\npresent day, at least in Lower Egypt, asserted that the Egyptians\r\nrendered divine honours[348]; and yet this naturalist had possessed\r\nopportunities of examining bones of the true ibis in a mummy which he\r\nopened in London[349].\r\n\r\nI also participated in the error of those celebrated men whom I have\r\njust mentioned, until the moment when I was enabled to examine some\r\nmummies of the ibis by myself. This pleasure was procured for me,\r\nfor the first time, by the late M. Fourcroy, to whom M. Grobert,\r\nColonel of Artillery, on his return from Egypt, had given two of\r\nthese mummies, both taken from the pits of Saccara. On carefully\r\nexposing them, we perceived that the bones of the embalmed bird\r\nwere much smaller than those of the _Tantalus ibis_ of naturalists;\r\nthat they did not much exceed those of the curlew in size, that its\r\nbeak resembled that of the latter, being only a little shorter in\r\nproportion to its thickness, and not at all that of the tantalus;\r\nand, lastly, that its plumage was white with the quills marked with\r\nblack, as the ancients have described it.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore convinced, that the bird which the ancient Egyptians\r\nembalmed, was by no means the Tantalus ibis of naturalists, that it\r\nwas smaller, and that it was to be sought for in the curlew genus. We\r\nfound, after some inquiries, that the mummies of the ibis which had\r\nbeen opened before by different naturalists, were similar to ours.\r\nBuffon says expressly that he examined several of them; that the\r\nbirds which they contained had the beak and size of curlews; and yet\r\nhe has blindly followed Perrault in taking the African tantalus for\r\nthe ibis. One of those mummies opened by Buffon still exists in the\r\nmuseum; it is similar to those which we have examined.\r\n\r\nDr Shaw, in the supplement to his Travels[350], describes and figures\r\nwith care the bones of a similar mummy. The beak, he says, was six\r\nEnglish inches in length, similar to that of the curlew, &c. In a\r\nword, its description agrees entirely with ours.\r\n\r\nCaylus, in his Collection of Antiquities, vol. vi. pl. xl. fig. 1.,\r\ngives a representation of the mummy of an ibis, the height of which,\r\nwith its bandages, is only one foot seven inches four lines, although\r\nhe says expressly that the bird was placed upon its feet with the\r\nhead straight out, and that it had no part inflected in its embalment.\r\n\r\nHasselquist, who took a small white and black heron for the ibis,\r\ngives, as his principal reason, that the size of this bird, which is\r\nthat of a crow, corresponds very well with that of the mummies of the\r\nibis[351]. How, then, could Linnæus have given the name of ibis to a\r\nbird as large as a stork? How, especially, could he have considered\r\nthis bird to be the same as the Ardea ibis of Hasselquist, which,\r\nbesides its smallness, had the beak straight? And how has this latter\r\nerror of synonymy been preserved to this very day in the _Systema\r\nNaturæ_?\r\n\r\nA short time after this examination, which was made in the presence\r\nof M. Fourcroy, M. Olivier had the politeness to shew us the bones\r\nwhich he had taken from two mummies of the ibis, and to open along\r\nwith us two others. These bones were found similar to those of\r\nColonel Grobert’s mummies; one of the four only was smaller, but it\r\nwas easy to judge by the epiphyses that it had belonged to a young\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe only figure of the beak of an embalmed ibis, which does not\r\nentirely agree with the objects which we have had under our eyes,\r\nis that of Edwards (pl. cv.); it is a ninth part larger, and yet we\r\ndo not doubt its accuracy, for M. Olivier shewed us also a beak an\r\neighth or a ninth longer than the others, or in the proportion of\r\n180 to 165, which had been equally taken from a mummy. This beak\r\nonly shews that there were among the ibises individuals larger than\r\nothers; but it proves nothing in favour of the tantalus, for it has\r\nnot at all the form of the beak of that animal. Its beak is perfectly\r\nsimilar to that of the curlews; and besides, the beak of the tantalus\r\nis a third longer than that of our largest embalmed ibises, and\r\ntwo-fifths longer than that of the smallest.\r\n\r\nWe have ascertained further, that similar variations with regard to\r\nthe size of the beak exist in our European curlews, according to the\r\nage and sex. They are still more strongly marked in the green curlew\r\nof Italy, and in our godwits; and this variation appears to be a\r\nproperty common to most of the species of the family of scolopaceous\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nLastly, our naturalists returned from the expedition to Egypt with\r\na rich harvest of objects, as well ancient as recent. My learned\r\nfriend M. Geoffroy St Hilaire, in particular, had occupied himself\r\nwith the greatest care in collecting mummies of all descriptions, and\r\nhad brought with him a great number of those of the ibis, both from\r\nSaccara and Thebes.\r\n\r\nThe former were in the same state as those which M. Grobert had\r\nbrought, that is to say, their bones had undergone a sort of half\r\nburning, and were without consistence; they broke on the slightest\r\ntouch, and it was very difficult to obtain any entire, and still more\r\nso to detach them for the purpose of making a skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe bones of those brought from Thebes were much better preserved,\r\neither on account of the greater heat of the climate, or from the\r\nmore efficacious means employed for their preparation; and M.\r\nGeoffroy having sacrificed some of them to me, M. Rousseau, my\r\nassistant, succeeded, by dint of patience and address, and by the\r\nemployment of ingenious and delicate methods of procedure, in making\r\nup an entire skeleton, by stripping all the bones, and connecting\r\nthem with a very fine wire. This skeleton is deposited in the\r\nanatomical galleries of the museum, of which it forms one of the\r\nmost beautiful ornaments, and we have represented it in Pl. iv.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that this mummy must have been that of a bird kept in a\r\nstate of domesticity in the temples, for its left humerus has been\r\nbroken and joined again. It is probable that a wild bird, whose wing\r\nhad been broken, would have perished before it had healed, from its\r\nbeing unable to pursue its prey, or to escape from its enemies.\r\n\r\nThis skeleton puts it in our power to determine, without any\r\nuncertainty, the characters and proportions of the bird. We see\r\nclearly that it was in all points a true curlew, a little larger than\r\nthe common curlew of Europe, but having the beak thicker and shorter.\r\nThe following is a comparative table of the dimensions of the two\r\nbirds, taken, for the ibis, from the skeleton of the mummy of Thebes,\r\nand for the curlew, from a skeleton which previously existed in our\r\nanatomical galleries. We have added those of parts of the Saccara\r\nibises, which we succeeded in obtaining entire.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+-------------+------------+----------------+\r\n  |                       | Skeleton of |Skeleton of |Saccara Ibises. |\r\n  |        Parts.         |an Ibis from |the Curlew. +-------+--------+\r\n  |                       |   Thebes.   |            |Larger.|Smaller.|\r\n  +-----------------------+-------------+------------+-------+--------+\r\n  |Head and beak together,|    0.210    |    0.215   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Head alone,            |    0.047    |    0.040   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |The 14 vertebræ of     |    0.192    |    0.150   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |  the neck together,   |             |            |       |        |\r\n  |Back,                  |    0.080    |    0.056   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Sacrum,                |    0.087    |    0.070   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Coccyx,                |    0.037    |    0.035   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Femur,                 |    0.078    |    0.060   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Tibia,                 |    0.150    |    0.112   |  ...  | 0.095  |\r\n  |Tarsus,                |    0.102    |    0.090   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Middle-toe,            |    0.097    |    0.070   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Sternum,               |    0.092    |    0.099   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  |Clavicle,              |    0.055    |    0.041   |  ...  | 0.04   |\r\n  |Humerus,               |    0.133    |    0.106   | 0.124 |  ...   |\r\n  |Fore-arm,              |    0.153    |    0.117   | 0.144 | 0.114  |\r\n  |Hand,                  |    0.125    |    0.103   |  ...  |  ...   |\r\n  +-----------------------+-------------+------------+----------------+\r\n\r\nIt appears by this table, that the animal of Thebes was larger than\r\nour curlew; that one of the Saccara ibises was intermediate in size\r\nbetween that of Thebes and our common curlew, and that the other was\r\nsmaller than this latter bird. It is also seen that the different\r\nparts of the body of the ibis do not observe the same proportions\r\nbetween each other, as those of the curlew. The beak of the former,\r\nfor example, is in particular shorter, although all the other parts\r\nare longer, &c.\r\n\r\nHowever, these differences of proportions do not exceed what might\r\nbe expected in species of the same genus: the forms and characters\r\nwhich may be considered as generic, are absolutely the same.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore search for the true ibis, not among those\r\ntantaluses of large size and sharp beak, but among the curlews; and,\r\nlet it be observed, that, by the name _curlew_, we intend to signify,\r\nnot the artificial genus formed by Latham and Gmelin, of all the\r\nwading birds which have the beak curved downwards, but a natural\r\ngenus, to which we shall give the name of _Numenius_, and which will\r\ncomprehend all the waders with beaks curved downwards, soft and\r\nrounded, whether their head be bare or clothed with feathers. It is\r\nthe genus _courlis_, such as Buffon imagined it[352].\r\n\r\nA glance over the collection of birds belonging to the royal cabinet,\r\nhas enabled us to distinguish a species, which is neither named nor\r\ndescribed in the works of systematic writers, excepting perhaps by\r\nDr Latham; and which, when carefully examined, will be found to\r\ncorrespond with all that the ancients, the monuments and mummies,\r\nindicate as characteristic of the ibis.\r\n\r\nWe here present a figure of it, Plate V. It is a bird somewhat larger\r\nthan the curlew; its beak is arcuate like that of the curlew, but\r\na little shorter, and sensibly thicker in proportion, somewhat\r\ncompressed at its base, and marked on each side with a groove,\r\nwhich, proceeding from the nostril, is continued to the extremity;\r\nwhile, in the curlew, there is a similar groove, which disappears\r\nbefore arriving at the middle of the beak; the colour of the beak is\r\nmore or less black; the head, and the two upper thirds of the neck,\r\nare entirely destitute of feathers, and the skin of these parts is\r\nblack. The plumage of the body, wings, and tail, is white, with the\r\nexception of the ends of the large quills of the wing, which are\r\nblack; the four last secondary quills have the barbs singularly long,\r\nattenuated, and hanging down over the ends of the wings, when the\r\nlatter are folded; their colour is a beautiful black, with violet\r\nreflections. The feet are black, the legs are thicker, and the toes\r\nmuch longer in proportion than those of the curlew; the membranes\r\nbetween the bases of the toes are also more extended; the leg is\r\nentirely covered with small polygonal, or what is called reticulated\r\nscales, and the base of the toes itself has only similar scales;\r\nwhile, in the curlew, two-thirds of the leg, and the whole length of\r\nthe toes, are scutulate, that is to say, furnished with transverse\r\nscales. There is a reddish tint under the wing, toward the top of the\r\nthigh, and on the anterior large wing coverts; but this tint appears\r\nto be an individual character, or the result of an accident, for\r\nit does not occur in other individuals that are in other respects\r\nentirely similar.\r\n\r\nThis first individual came from the collection of the Stadtholder,\r\nand its native country was unknown. The late M. Desmoulins, assistant\r\nnaturalist to the Museum, who had seen two others, asserted that\r\nthey came from Senegal; one of them must even have been brought by\r\nM. Geoffroy de Villeneuve: but we shall see, as we proceed, that\r\nBruce[353] found this species in Abyssinia, where it was named\r\n_Abou-Hannes_ (Father John); and that M. Savigny saw it in abundance\r\nin Lower Egypt, where it was called _Abou-Mengel_ (Father of the\r\nSickle). It is probable that the moderns will give no credit to the\r\nassertion of the ancients, that the ibis never left Egypt without\r\nperishing[354]. This assertion would, besides, be as contrary to the\r\nTantalus Ibis as to our common Curlew; for the individuals which we\r\nhave in Europe came from Senegal. It was from thence that M. Geoffroy\r\nde Villeneuve had brought the individual in the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. It is even much rarer in Egypt than our curlew; for, since\r\nPerrault, nobody mentions having seen it there, or having received\r\nit from that country. An individual without the reddish tint, but in\r\nother respects perfectly similar to the first, was brought home by M.\r\nde Labillardiere, in his voyage to Australasia made along with M.\r\nd’Entrecasteux.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards learned, that, when young, these birds have the head\r\nand neck furnished with feathers in the part which, as they advance\r\nin age, is to become bare; and that the scapulars are less elongated,\r\nand of a paler and duller black. It is in this state that one was\r\nbrought to us from Australasia by the late Peron, which, in other\r\nrespects, differs from ours, and from that of M. Labillardiere,\r\nonly in having some black markings on the alula and first large\r\ncoverts, and in which the head and upper part of the neck are covered\r\nwith blackish feathers. It was also a youngish individual which M.\r\nSavigny brought from Egypt, and which is figured in his memoir upon\r\nthe Ibis, Plate I.; and in the great work on Egypt, under the head\r\nBirds, Pl. VII. The feathers of the head and back part of the neck\r\nare rather grey than black; those of the fore part of the neck are\r\nwhite. Lastly, Bruce’s figure (Atlas, Plate XXXV.) is also taken from\r\na young individual observed in Abyssinia, and almost similar to that\r\nof M. Savigny.\r\n\r\nWe have received from Pondicherry, by M. Leschenault, an individual\r\nsimilar to that of Peron, but in which, the head only, and a small\r\npart of the back of the neck, are furnished with blackish feathers;\r\nall the rest is covered with white feathers. But it is not the less\r\ncertain, that all these birds have the head and the neck bare when\r\nthey are full grown.\r\n\r\nThe late M. Macé sent from Bengal to the Museum several individuals\r\nof a species very nearly allied to this, which has the beak a little\r\nlonger, and less arched, of which the first quill only has a little\r\nblack on the two edges of its point, and of which the secondary\r\nquills are also somewhat attenuated, and slightly tinged with reddish.\r\n\r\nIt appears, according to M. Savigny, p. 25, that M. Levaillant\r\nobserved another still, which has the secondary quills similarly\r\nelongated, but of which the neck always retains its feathers, and\r\nwhose face is of a red colour.\r\n\r\nThe same M. Macé also sent us a tantalus, very much resembling that\r\nwhich has been regarded by naturalists as the ibis, but of which the\r\nsmall wing-coverts, and a broad band at the lower part of the breast,\r\nare black, and speckled with white. The last secondary quills are\r\nelongated, and tinged with rose-colour. It is known that, in the\r\nTantalus ibis of naturalists, the small wing-coverts are speckled\r\nwith purplish red, and that the whole under part of the body is white.\r\n\r\nWe give here a table of the parts of some of these birds, which could\r\nbe accurately measured in stuffed individuals. By comparing them\r\nwith those of the skeletons of embalmed ibises, one may judge if\r\nit were possible to believe for a single moment that these mummies\r\nbelonged to the tantalus.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+-------+-------+-------+---------------------+\r\n  |                       |Length of the beak, from its commissure to   |\r\n  |                       |the tip,                                     |\r\n  |                       |       |Length of the naked part of the leg, |\r\n  |  PARTS OF THE BODY.   |       |       |Length of the tarsus,        |\r\n  |                       |       |       |       |Length of the middle |\r\n  |                       |       |       |       |toe,                 |\r\n  +-----------------------+-------+-------+-------+---------------------+\r\n  |Tantalus Ibis of       |       |       |       |                     |\r\n  |  Naturalists.         | 0.210 | 0.130 | 0.190 | 0.105               |\r\n  |Macé’s Indian          |       |       |       |                     |\r\n  |  Tantalus.            | 0.265 | 0.150 | 0.250 | 0.115               |\r\n  |Numenius Ibis the true |       |       |       |                     |\r\n  |  Ibis of the Ancients.| 0.125 | 0.041 | 0.085 | 0.080               |\r\n  |Numenius Ibis, measured|       |       |       |                     |\r\n  |  by M.

How could this description have been\r\napplied to a bird which has only the face bare, and which has that\r\npart of a red colour, to a bird which has the rump white, and not\r\ncovered over at least as ours by the black feathers of the wings?\r\n\r\nAnd yet this latter character was essential to the ibis. Plutarch (De\r\nIside et Osiride) says, that the manner in which the white was cut\r\nby the black in the plumage of this bird, presented the form of a\r\nlunar crescent. It is, in fact, by the union of the black of the last\r\nquills, with that of the two ends of the wings, that there is formed,\r\nin the white, a large semicircular notch, which gives to the white\r\nthe figure of a crescent.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to explain what he has intended to say, in\r\naverring that the feet of the ibis form an equilateral triangle with\r\nits beak. But we can understand the assertion of Ælian, that when\r\nit draws in its head and neck among its feathers, it represents, in\r\nsome measure, the figure of a heart.[356] It was on account of this,\r\naccording to Horus Apollo (c. 35.), the emblem of the human heart.\r\n\r\nFrom what Herodotus says of the nakedness of the throat, and of the\r\nfeathers which covered the upper part of the neck, he appears to have\r\nhad under his eyes a middle aged individual; but it is not the less\r\ncertain, that the Egyptians also knew very well the individuals with\r\nthe neck entirely bare. We see such represented from sculptures in\r\nbronze, in Caylus’s Collection of Egyptian Antiquities (vol. i. pl.\r\nx. no. 4., and vol. v. pl. xi. no. 1.) This last figure is even so\r\nlike our bird represented in pl. v., that it might be said that it\r\nwas taken from it.\r\n\r\nThe paintings of Herculaneum no longer leave any doubt on the\r\nsubject. Plates 138 and 140 of David’s edition, and vol. ii. p. 315,\r\npl. 59, and p. 321, pl. 60 of the original edition, which represent\r\nEgyptian ceremonies, shew several ibises walking in the court of\r\nthe temples. The characteristic blackness of the head and neck are\r\nin particular recognised, and it is easily seen from the proportion\r\nwhich their figure bears to the persons in the painting, that it must\r\nhave been a bird of half a metre at the most, and not of a metre, or\r\nthereabouts, like the Tantalus ibis.\r\n\r\nThe mosaic of Palestine, also presents in its middle part several\r\nibises perched upon buildings. They differ in nothing from those of\r\nthe paintings of Herculaneum. A Sardonyx of Dr Mead’s Collection,\r\ncopied by Shaw, App. pl. v., and representing an ibis, seems to be\r\na miniature of the bird which we have described. A medal of Adrian,\r\nin large bronze, represented in the Farnesian Museum, vol. vi.\r\npl. xxviii. fig. 16, and another of the same emperor, in silver,\r\nrepresented in vol. iii. pl. vi. fig. 9, afford figures of the ibis,\r\nwhich, notwithstanding their smallness, are pretty like our bird.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the figures of the ibis, sculptured upon the plinth\r\nof the statue of the Nile, at Belvedere, and upon the copy of it at\r\nthe garden of the Tuileries, they are not sufficiently finished to\r\nserve as proofs; but among the hieroglyphics of which the Institute\r\nof Egypt has caused impressions to be made upon the spot, there are\r\nseveral which distinctly represent our bird. In plate iii. fig.\r\n1, we give one of these impressions which M. Geoffroy has had the\r\npoliteness to communicate to us.\r\n\r\nWe insist particularly on this latter figure, because it is the most\r\nauthentic of all, having been made at the time, and on the spot where\r\nthe ibis was worshipped, and being cotemporary with its mummies;\r\nwhile those which we have cited above, having been made in Italy, and\r\nby artists who did not profess the Egyptian worship, might have been\r\nless faithful.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Bruce the justice of saying, that he recognised the bird\r\nwhich he describes under the name of _Abou-Hannes_, as the true\r\nibis. He says expressly, that this bird appeared to him to resemble\r\nthat which the mummy pitchers contained; and further, that this\r\nAbou-Hannes, or _Father John_, is very common on the banks of the\r\nNile, while he never saw there the bird represented by Buffon, under\r\nthe name of the White Ibis of Egypt.\r\n\r\nM. Savigny, one of the naturalists of the expedition to Egypt,\r\nequally asserts his not having seen the _Tantalus_ in that country,\r\nbut he obtained a great number of our _Numenius_ near the Lake\r\nMenzale, in Lower Egypt, and carried their skins with him.\r\n\r\nThe Abou-Hannes has been placed by Latham, in his _Index\r\nOrnithologicus_, under the name of _Tantalus Æthiopicus_; but he does\r\nnot speak of Bruce’s conjecture respecting its identity with the\r\nibis. The travellers before and after Bruce appear to have all been\r\nin error. Belon thought that the white ibis was the stork, in which\r\nhe evidently contradicted all testimony on that head. No person has\r\nadopted his opinion in this matter, excepting the apothecaries, who\r\nhave taken the stork for an emblem, because they have confounded it\r\nwith the ibis, to which the invention of clysters is attributed[357].\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus, who relates that this invention is due to the\r\nibis, gives no description of this bird in his Medicine of the\r\nEgyptians[358]. In his Natural History of Egypt, he speaks of it only\r\nafter Herodotus, to whose account he only adds, without doubt from a\r\npassage of Strabo, which I shall mention farther on, that that bird\r\nresembles the stork in size and figure. He mentions his having been\r\ninformed that white and black ones occurred in abundance on the edges\r\nof the Nile; but it is evident from his very expressions, that he did\r\nnot believe it had been seen there[359].\r\n\r\nShaw says of the ibis,[360] that it is at the present day excessively\r\nrare, and that he has never seen it. His _Emseesy_, or ox-bird, which\r\nGmelin very improperly refers to the Tantalus Ibis, is of the size\r\nof the curlew, with the body white, and the beak and feet red. It\r\nfrequents the meadows, where it follows the cattle; its flesh is not\r\nwell tasted, and corrupts quickly. It is easy to see that this is not\r\nthe Tantalus, and still less the Ibis of the ancients.\r\n\r\nHasselquist was not acquainted with the white Ibis nor with the black\r\none, his _Ardea Ibis_ is a small heron, which has the beak straight.\r\nLinnæus had acted very properly in placing it among the herons, in\r\nhis tenth edition; but he erred, as I have said, in transporting it\r\nafterwards as a synonym to the genus _Tantalus_.\r\n\r\nDemaillet[361] conjectures that the ibis might be the bird peculiar\r\nto Egypt, and which was named Pharaoh’s Fowl (_Chapon de Pharaon_),\r\nand at Aleppo _Saphan-bacha_. It devours serpents. There are of them\r\nwhite, and white and black; and it follows, for more than a hundred\r\nleagues, the caravans which go from Cairo to Mecca, for the purpose\r\nof feeding upon the carcases of animals which are killed during the\r\njourney, while at any other time there is not one seen along this\r\nroute. But the author does not consider this conjecture as certain;\r\nhe even says, that we must give up understanding the ancients, when\r\nthey have spoken so as not to be understood. He ends with concluding,\r\nthat the ancients have perhaps indiscriminately comprehended under\r\nthe name of Ibis, all birds which rendered to Egypt the service of\r\nclearing it of the dangerous reptiles which this climate produces\r\nin abundance, such as the vulture, the falcon, the stork, the\r\nsparrowhawk, &c.\r\n\r\nHe had reason not to regard his Pharaoh’s fowl as the ibis; for,\r\nalthough its description is very imperfect, and although Buffon\r\nfancied he recognised the ibis in it, it is easy to judge, as well\r\nas by what Pokocke says of it, that this bird must be a carnivorous\r\none; and, in fact, we see from Bruce’s figure (Vol. v. p. 191. of\r\nthe French edition), that Pharaoh’s fowl is nothing else than the\r\n_rachama_ or the small white vulture with black wings (_Vultur\r\nperenopterus_, Linn.)--a bird very different from what we have proved\r\nabove to be the ibis.\r\n\r\nPokocke says that it appears, from the descriptions which are given\r\nof the ibis, and from the figures which he has seen of it in the\r\ntemples of Upper Egypt, that it was a species of Crane. I have seen,\r\nhe adds, a number of these birds in the islands of the Nile; they\r\nwere for the most part greyish[362]. These few words suffice to prove\r\nthat he did not know the ibis better than the others.\r\n\r\nThe learned have not been more happy in their conjectures than the\r\ntravellers. Middleton refers to the ibis, a bronze figure of a\r\nbird, of which the beak is arched, but short, the neck very long,\r\nand the head furnished with a small crest, a figure which never had\r\nany resemblance to the bird of the Egyptians[363]. This figure is,\r\nbesides, not at all in the Egyptian style, and Middleton himself\r\nagrees that it must have been made at Rome. Saumaise upon Solinus\r\nsays nothing that relates to the present question.\r\n\r\nAs to the black ibis, which Aristotle places only near Pelusium[364];\r\nit was long thought that Belon alone had seen it[365]. The bird which\r\nhe describes under this name is a species of curlew, to which he\r\nattributes a head similar to that of the cormorant, that is to say,\r\napparently bald, a red beak, and feet of the same colour; but as he\r\ndoes not speak of the ibis in his journey[366], I suppose that it was\r\nonly in France that he made this reference, and by comparison with\r\nmummies of the Ibis. What is certain is, that this curlew, with the\r\nbeak and feet red, was not known in Egypt[367], but that our green\r\ncurlew of Europe (_Scolopax Falcinellus_, Linn. Pl. Enl. 819.) is\r\nseen very commonly there, that it is even more abundant than the\r\nwhite numenius[368]; and, as it resembles it in form and size, and,\r\nfurther, as its plumage may appear black, it can by no means be\r\ndoubted that it was the true black ibis of the ancients. M. Savigny\r\nalso made a drawing of it in Egypt, but from a young individual\r\nonly[369]. Buffon’s figure is from an adult bird; but its colours are\r\ntoo pale.\r\n\r\nThe error which prevails at present respecting the white ibis began\r\nwith Perrault, who was also the first naturalist who made known the\r\nTantalus ibis of the present day. This error, adopted by Brisson\r\nand Buffon, passed into the twelfth edition of Linnæus, where it is\r\nblended with that of Hasselquist, which had been inserted in the\r\ntenth, forming with it a compound altogether monstrous.\r\n\r\nIt was founded on the idea, that the ibis was essentially a bird that\r\ndestroyed serpents, and upon this very natural conclusion, that, in\r\norder to enable it to devour these reptiles, it was necessary for it\r\nto have a sharp beak, more or less resembling that of the heron. This\r\nidea is even the only good objection that can be made against the\r\nidentity of our bird to the ibis. How, it is urged, could a bird with\r\na weak bill, a curlew, devour those dangerous reptiles?\r\n\r\nIt may be replied, that positive proofs, such descriptions, figures,\r\nand mummies, ought always to preponderate over accounts of habits\r\ntoo often imagined without any other motive than to justify the\r\ndifferent worships rendered to animals. It might be added, the\r\nserpents from which the ibis delivered Egypt, are represented to\r\nus as very venomous, but not as very large. I have even obtained a\r\ndirect proof that the birds preserved as mummies, which have had a\r\nbeak precisely similar to that of our bird, were true serpent eaters;\r\nfor I found in one of their mummies the still undigested remains\r\nof the skin and scales of serpents, which I have deposited in our\r\nanatomical galleries.\r\n\r\nBut, at the present day, M. Savigny, who has observed, in a living\r\nstate, and more than once dissected our white numenius, the bird\r\nwhich every thing concurs to prove to have been the ibis, asserts\r\nthat it only eats worms, fresh water shells, and other small animals\r\nof that sort. Supposing this fact to have no exception, all that can\r\nbe concluded from it is, that the Egyptians, as has happened more\r\nthan once to them and others, had invented a false reason for an\r\nabsurd worship. It is true that Herodotus says, he saw, in a place\r\non the borders of the desert[370], near Buto, a narrow gorge, in\r\nwhich a multitude of bones were heaped up, which he was informed\r\nwere remains of winged serpents, that were seeking to penetrate into\r\nEgypt in spring, and that the ibises had arrested their passage. But\r\nhe does not say that he had witnessed their combats, or that he had\r\nseen those winged serpents in their entire state. The whole of his\r\ntestimony, therefore, reduces itself to this, that he had observed a\r\nheap of bones, which may very well have been those of the multitude\r\nof reptiles and other animals which the inundation destroyed every\r\nyear, and whose bodies it would naturally carry to the places where\r\nit was stopped, to the borders of the desert, and which must by\r\npreference have accumulated in a narrow gorge.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is equally from this idea of the combats of the ibis with\r\nserpents, that Cicero gives that bird a horny and strong beak[371].\r\nHaving never been in Egypt, he imagined that this must have been the\r\ncase by mere analogy.\r\n\r\nI am aware that Strabo says somewhere, that the ibis resembles the\r\nstork in form and size[372], and that this author ought to have\r\nknown it well, since he asserts that in his time the streets and\r\ncross-ways of Alexandria were so filled with them, that they proved a\r\ngreat inconvenience; but he must have spoken of it from memory. His\r\ntestimony cannot be received when he contradicts all the rest, and\r\nespecially when the bird itself is there to refute him.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, I shall not trouble myself about the passage where\r\nÆlian[373] relates, according to the Egyptian embalmers, that the\r\nintestines of the ibis are eighty-six cubits long. The Egyptian\r\npriests of all classes have been guilty of so many extravagancies\r\nwith regard to Natural History, that no great importance can be\r\nattributed to what one of their lowest classes might aver.\r\n\r\nAn objection might still be drawn against my opinion from the long\r\nattenuated and black feathers which cover the rump of our bird,\r\nand of which some traces also are seen in Bruce’s figure of the\r\nAbou-Hannes. The ancients, it might be said, do not speak of them in\r\ntheir descriptions, and their figures do not exhibit them. But I have\r\nmore on my side, in respect to this matter, than a written testimony\r\nor a figured representation. I have found precisely the same feathers\r\nin one of the Saccara mummies; I kept them carefully as being at\r\nonce a singular monument of antiquity and a peremptory proof of the\r\nidentity of species. These feathers having an uncommon form, and not\r\noccurring, I believe, in any other curlew, leave, in fact, no doubt\r\nrespecting the accuracy of my opinion.\r\n\r\nI conclude this memoir with a view of its results:\r\n\r\n1. The Tantalus Ibis of Linnæus ought to constitute a separate genus,\r\nalong with the _Tantalus Loculator_. Their character would be:\r\n_Rostrum læve, validum, arcuatum, apice utrinque emarginatum_.\r\n\r\n2. The other Tantali of the last editions should form a genus with\r\nthe common curlews, to which the name of _Numenius_ might be given.\r\nThe character of the genus would be: _Rostrum teres, gracile,\r\narcuatum, apice mutico_. For the special character of the subgenus\r\nof the Ibises, there should be added: _Sulco laterali per totam\r\nlongitudinem exarato_.\r\n\r\n3. The white ibis of the ancients is not the ibis of Perrault and\r\nBuffon, which is a _Tantalus_; nor the ibis of Hasselquist, which is\r\nan _Ardea_; nor the ibis of Maillet, which is a _Vulture_; but it is\r\na bird of the genus Numenius, and of the sub-genus Ibis, which has\r\nhitherto been described and figured only by Bruce, under the name of\r\n_Abou-Hannes_. I give it the name of NUMENIUS IBIS, _albus, capite\r\net collo adulti nudis, remigum apicibus, rostro et pedibus nigris,\r\nremigibus secondariis elongatis nigro-violaceis_.\r\n\r\n4. The black ibis of the ancients is probably the bird which we\r\nknow in Europe under the name of Green Curlew, or the _Scolopax\r\nFalcinellus_ of Linnæus. It also belongs to the genus Numenius, and\r\nto the sub-genus Ibis.\r\n\r\n5. The _Tantalus Ibis_ of Linnæus, in the present state of synonymy,\r\ncomprehends four species of three different genera, namely,\r\n\r\n1. A Tantalus, the ibis of Perrault and Buffon;\r\n\r\n2. An Ardea, the ibis of Hasselquist;\r\n\r\n3. and 4. Two Numenii, the ibis of Belonius, and the ox-bird of Shaw.\r\n\r\nFrom this example, and so many others, one may judge of the state in\r\nwhich the _Systema Naturæ_ still exists, which it would be of so much\r\nadvantage to purge by degrees of the errors with which it abounds,\r\nand which would seem to be every day increasing, by the addition of\r\nspecies, characters, and synonyms, made without selection and without\r\ncritical examination.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion of the whole investigation is, that the Ibis\r\nstill exists in Egypt, as it did in the days of the Pharaohs, and,\r\nthat it was owing to the inaccuracy of naturalists that the species\r\nwas for some time thought to be extinct, or to have been altered in\r\nits forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATIONS,\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR JAMESON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Civil History records are consulted, medals examined, and antique\r\ninscriptions deciphered, in order to determine the epochs of human\r\nrevolutions, and verify moral events; so in Natural History we must\r\nsearch the archives of the world; draw from the bowels of the earth\r\nthe monuments of former times; collect the fragments, and gather into\r\none body of proofs all the indices of physical changes, which may\r\nenable us to retrace the different ages of nature.

Cuvier adopts the opinion of De Luc, that all the older strata\r\nof which the crust of the earth is composed, were originally in\r\nan horizontal situation, and have been raised into their present\r\nhighly-inclined position, by subsidences that have taken place over\r\nthe whole surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, that subsidences, to a considerable extent,\r\nhave taken place; yet we are not of opinion that these have been so\r\ngeneral as maintained by these geologists. We are rather inclined to\r\nbelieve, that the present inclined position of strata is in general\r\ntheir original one;--an opinion which is countenanced by the known\r\nmode of connection of strata, the phenomena of veins, particularly\r\ncontemporaneous veins, the crystalline nature of every species of\r\nolder rock, and the great regularity in the _direction_ of strata\r\nthroughout the globe.\r\n\r\nThe transition and flœtz-rocks also are much more of a chemical or\r\ncrystalline nature than has been generally imagined. Even sandstone,\r\none of the most abundant of the flœtz-rocks, occasionally occurs in\r\nmasses, many yards in extent, which individually have a tabular or\r\nstratified structure; but, when viewed on the great scale, appear to\r\nbe great massive distinct concretions. These massive concretions,\r\nwith their subordinate tabular structures, if not carefully\r\ninvestigated, are apt to bewilder the mineralogist, and to force him\r\nto have recourse to a general system of subsidence or elevation of\r\nthe strata, in order to explain the phenomena they exhibit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE C, p. 13.\r\n\r\nDELUGE.\r\n\r\nThere are many facts, some of which are recorded in the Bible, that\r\nare hostile to Cuvier and De Luc’s opinions stated in the text,\r\nviz. that the bed of the ocean was changed at the flood, or last\r\ngreat catastrophe; and that the land, formerly occupied by animals,\r\nwas henceforth given up to fishes and other marine tribes. We are\r\ntold, for example, that the dove, which was sent forth from the ark,\r\nfound an olive-tree, whence it plucked a leaf, to carry back to the\r\npatriarch, as a proof that the waters of the deluge were subsiding;\r\nand we also find that the Assyrian rivers, which originally marked\r\nthe situation of Eden, retained the same geographical relations after\r\nthe earth had been repeopled. The natural history of the fossil\r\norganic remains contained in alluvial deposits, is also in opposition\r\nto the opinion of De Luc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE D, p. 19.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF PRIMITIVE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nMitscherlich, in a memoir read before the Royal Academy of Berlin,\r\nbut not yet published, enters fully into the illustration of the\r\nigneous origin of mountains, especially those of the primitive class,\r\ndeducible from his experiments on the formation of minerals by\r\nfusion. As the view is interesting, we shall here give a short sketch\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nHave the primitive mountains of our globe, whose form necessarily\r\nsupposes a fluid state, been dissolved in water; or has the\r\ntemperature of our earth been raised to such a degree, that the\r\nsubstances of which our primitive mountains are formed have become\r\nfluid? This question has been differently answered, and the solutions\r\ngiven have been attempted to be supported in proportion as the\r\nobservation of geological facts, and the inquiries instituted\r\nwith reference to the chemical combinations which compose the\r\nearth, have been developed. New observations, and the discovery of\r\nunknown laws in chemistry and mineralogy, must, at the same time,\r\nopen a new field for speculation and observation in geology. Of\r\nthe discoveries of our own times, there certainly is none which\r\nhas exercised a greater influence upon mineralogy than that of\r\ndeterminate proportions, and especially the result of the researches\r\nof Berzelius, that the chemical combinations which nature produces,\r\nare formed according to the laws which he has discovered with regard\r\nto artificial combinations; a result which has entirely changed the\r\naspect of this science, and has elicited a new system of mineralogy,\r\nin which the natural-chemical combinations are ranked with those\r\nwhich are artificial; which affords a confirmation to the laws of\r\ncrystallography, as being the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the truth of the position, that the laws\r\nof natural combinations are the same as those which artificial\r\ncombinations follow; that chemistry can decompose minerals; but\r\nthat, in the formation of these combinations, natural laws have\r\nbeen in activity, which art would in vain attempt to reproduce: but\r\nthis objection is groundless. The chemical affinity which acts in\r\nartificial combinations is a power of nature, as well as the affinity\r\nwhich regulates the composition of natural combinations: chemical\r\naffinity, in general, is a quality of matter. In this objection,\r\nmodifying circumstances have been confounded with laws. The chemist\r\nwould very easily refute the objection, if he could compose minerals\r\nof their elements, and produce artificial combinations similar in all\r\ntheir characters to minerals themselves. From such researches, there\r\nwould, at the same time, be diffused a new light upon geological\r\ninvestigations. In this manner many phenomena would be reproduced,\r\nwhich have taken place at the formation of the earth; geological\r\nobservations would be repeated by experiments, which might be varied\r\nat pleasure, for confirming these observations; and the recurrence\r\nin nature itself would be sought of those phenomena which have been\r\nproduced in the laboratory;--inquiries, which are, however, of great\r\nimportance, because they may be arbitrarily disposed and arranged\r\naccording to the theory in view.\r\n\r\nThe importance of such attempts shew the value of any experiments\r\nthat go to prove the formation of minerals by artificial means; and\r\nMitscherlich has been very successful in detecting several mineral\r\nspecies formed artificially.\r\n\r\nBerzelius has shown, in his Chemical System of Mineralogy, that the\r\ngreater part of the chemical combinations of which our Earth is\r\ncomposed, and especially the primitive mountains, are analogous to\r\nsalts and double salts; and that, in these combinations, the silica,\r\ncarbonic acid, and oxide of iron, act the part of acids; the silica\r\ncombines with the alumina, lime, magnesia, protoxide and peroxide\r\nof iron, protoxide of manganese, potash and soda, forming, with\r\nthese bases, either simple salts, or double salts, in proportions\r\ndetermined by the different degrees of saturation; the carbonic acid\r\nis combined with the lime and manganese, and the peroxide of iron\r\nwith the protoxide.\r\n\r\nThe object which should be proposed in these attempts, of which we\r\nspeak, is to investigate the relation of these bases to the three\r\nacids. We find ourselves fortunately seconded in this attempt by\r\na branch of national industry; for the complete extraction of the\r\ngreater number of metals depends upon the relation of the silica to\r\nthe above-mentioned bases, the degrees of saturation in which the\r\nsilica may occur with them, the greater or less degree of affinity\r\nwith which these bases combine with the silica, and, lastly, the\r\nchemical qualities of the combination formed. It is necessary for\r\nthe metallurgist that he endeavour, in order to attain his object\r\ncompletely, to produce, in proportion as the minerals differ,\r\ndifferent chemical combinations of the substances which compose\r\nthese minerals; but always in determinate proportions, either by\r\nadding a foreign substance, or by regulating the fusion by the choice\r\nof minerals. The combinations which the metallurgist thus produces,\r\nare ordinarily minerals which have already been found in nature,\r\nsometimes even new species.\r\n\r\nDuring a journey in Sweden, Mitscherlich observed at Fahlun, where\r\nhe made inquiries regarding the ores, the scoriæ, and in general\r\nregarding the extraction of copper, in order to form a correct idea\r\nof this operation, not only some well-formed crystals in the scoriæ;\r\nbut also found that the whole mass of the slag had a crystalline\r\ntexture; and that the crystals, and the joints of the slags which had\r\na lamellar texture, remained the same at different periods of fusion,\r\nprovided only that the manner of operating of the metallurgist\r\nremained the same. The examination of the crystalline figure of the\r\nslag proved, that it was that of a mineral which has a composition\r\nanalogous to that of the slag. After having made this observation, he\r\nfound in almost every foundery which he visited in Sweden, different\r\ncrystalline combinations, which resembled minerals. Thus he found at\r\nFahlun, silicate and bisilicate of protoxide of iron; at Garpenberg,\r\nmica, and several times augite and chrysolite. These combinations\r\nhave not only the same crystalline figures, but also all the other\r\ncharacters of the corresponding minerals.\r\n\r\nI have pursued these inquiries, says Mitscherlich, since my return\r\nfrom Sweden; I have analysed the productions which I have found, and\r\nthe analysis has confirmed what the exterior had led to anticipate. I\r\nhave also augmented my observations by journeys in various districts\r\nof Germany; and farther, I have been seconded in my researches by my\r\nfriends; so that I now possess upwards of forty different species of\r\ncrystallized chemical combinations produced by fusion, the greater\r\nnumber of which are minerals already known; some are new species,\r\nwhich have not hitherto been met with in nature.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of mica, which forms a predominant constituent part of\r\nour primitive mountains, as an artificial production, gave rise to\r\nthe following geological speculations.\r\n\r\nThe artificial production by fusion, of the minerals which compose\r\nour primitive rocks, appears, according to Mitscherlich, to place\r\nbeyond doubt the theory that our primitive mountains were formerly\r\na melted mass. Such a state of fluidity, he continues, affords an\r\neasy explanation of the figure of the Earth, of the increase of\r\ntemperature as we proceed into its interior, of hot springs, and of\r\nmany other phenomena. With respect to this theory, we may refer to M.\r\nLaplace, who is convinced of its plausibility, without grounding his\r\nbelief upon the reasons which chemistry presents. I propose, however,\r\nto make mention of a few facts, in order to shew with what facility\r\nmany chemical phenomena in geology may be explained by following this\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nPrimitive mountains are generally distributed over the surface of the\r\nearth: it necessarily follows that the bodies which have composed\r\nthe surface of the earth have participated of the temperature which\r\nthe primitive mountains have had at the period when they were in a\r\nfluid state. The temperature at which water boils depends upon the\r\npressure of the atmosphere; and if the temperature of the earth\r\nincreases, we only require to diminish the mean height of the sea\r\n32 feet, in order to have a pressure of an atmosphere more; and it\r\nis by this pressure that the degree of temperature at which water\r\nboils will also be raised higher. M. Laplace judges from the height\r\nof the sea during flowing and ebbing, that the mean depth of the\r\nsea is about 96,000 feet. Supposing three-fourths of this mass of\r\nwater were converted into vapour, the pressure of this vapour would\r\nbe nearly equal to 2250 atmospheres; and this pressure would so\r\naugment the degree of heat at which water enters into ebullition,\r\nthat the primitive mountains might be in a state of fusion, without\r\nthe water with which they are covered being heated to the boiling\r\npoint; for the water which is not converted into vapour, and whose\r\nquantity is a fourth of the whole mass of vapour, according to the\r\nsupposition which we have made, would cover the whole earth, because\r\nwater expands in increasing proportion if the temperature be raised,\r\nand because the expansion of water is much greater than that of the\r\nmass of our primitive mountains; and, consequently, according to\r\nthis supposition, our primitive mountains are formed, covered with\r\nred hot water. The great pressure of so many atmospheres necessarily\r\nmodifies the reciprocal affinities of the substances which compose\r\nthe primitive mountains.\r\n\r\nPrimitive mountains are distinguished from volcanic productions in\r\nthis, that the lime and magnesia, which in them are combined with\r\ncarbonic acid, form with the silex silicates and bisilicates. It\r\nis necessary that the silex, which, under the ordinary pressure,\r\nand at an elevated temperature, expels the carbonic acid, exercise\r\nno influence under the pressure of so many atmospheres; and it is\r\nnot surprising that crystals of quartz occur in Carrara marble.\r\nIn volcanic productions, this pressure no longer exists, and we\r\nshould find among these the same phenomena which our laboratories\r\nand metallurgic operations present. Following this theory, the\r\ncircumstances that primitive mountains contain gypsum and carbonates,\r\nand that water occurs in quartz, very readily admit of explanation.\r\nAnd with regard to this latter phenomenon, the observations detailed\r\nby Sir Humphry Davy afford an additional confirmation of the theory\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nWe may explain in the same manner another phenomenon, which is more\r\nin connection with the present state of our globe. Many observations\r\nshew that the sea stood formerly at a much higher level than it does\r\nat present. The water of the sea expands, if the temperature be\r\nelevated more than the land. Admitting that the surface of the earth\r\nhas a temperature of 80° of Reaumur, and that the mean depth of the\r\nsea may be 96,000 feet, the height of the sea would then be 4000 feet\r\nhigher than it is at present. If we suppose, as may be done without\r\ncommitting any great error, that the expansion of the primitive\r\nmountains is equal to that of glass, and that they have been at a\r\ntemperature of 200°, and even at a much lower one, the water of the\r\nsea would cover the secondary mountains, in which we find the remains\r\nof marine animals. This explanation of the former height of the sea\r\nappears very simple, because the elevated temperature of the earth\r\nmay have resulted either from its original state of fluidity, or from\r\na geological revolution, which has destroyed, at the same time, the\r\norganic beings of a former period.\r\n\r\nIf primitive mountains and volcanic formations have been fluid, and\r\nhave crystallised on cooling, it is necessary that we should retrace\r\nin them the same phenomena and the same laws which we still observe\r\nat the present time. If a fluid body become solid by cooling, these\r\nphenomena are differently modified, according to the chemical nature\r\nof the bodies, and according to the crystalline forms which they\r\nacquire on cooling; but the laws remain always the same. Mitscherlich\r\nsays, I am in possession of some specimens which explain several\r\nof the phenomena so often shewn by basalt and volcanic formations.\r\nI do not possess artificial basalt resembling the natural columnar\r\nkind; yet the slags obtained at the furnaces of Sahla resemble basalt\r\nso perfectly, as to deceive the most experienced eye, especially\r\nas their cavities contain crystals of augite. But I have found at\r\nFahlun a bisilicate of protoxide of iron, which has in consequence\r\na composition analogous to that of basalt, and which has distinct\r\njoints. In this slag we perceive that the joints, which are\r\nparallel to the axis of the prism and to the lateral planes of the\r\ncrystals, are always perpendicular to the plane of cooling. This is\r\nparticularly observable in a specimen which was obtained by melting\r\nthe slag in a mould; on crystallizing it had several planes of\r\ncooling, and the joints are parallel to each of these planes. The\r\nplanes of separation in basalt present exactly the same phenomenon as\r\nthis slag.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which take place when a fluid body crystallizes may be\r\nobserved in sulphur, better than in any other body. All fluid bodies,\r\nhowever, and even water, on freezing, present the same phenomena.\r\n\r\nIf a fluid body has cooled to the point at which it begins to become\r\nsolid, for example, sulphur, in a round vessel, a crust of sulphur is\r\nnot formed upon the surface of the cooled vessel, and another crust\r\nupon the surface of the sulphur itself, as might be expected; on the\r\ncontrary, if a crystal be formed upon a point of the inner surface of\r\nthe vessel, the crystal enlarges by growing in the direction of its\r\naxis, and the mass which surrounds the crystal remains liquid, and\r\nsometimes cools, without the molecules arranging themselves in the\r\nsame manner as the crystal already formed. On examining the cooled\r\nmass, we observe that it shews a lamellar texture where the crystal\r\nwas formed, and that the mass which surrounded it does not shew this\r\ntexture in the same degree. This explains how veins of large-granular\r\ngranite traverse a small-granular granite, as well as other phenomena\r\nof the same nature.\r\n\r\nThis observation also affords an explanation of another phenomenon.\r\nIf the half of the liquid mass has become solid, and if the fluid\r\npart be poured off, we obtain isolated crystals, which have been\r\nformed in the fluid mass. If the fluid part be not poured off,\r\nand be permitted to cool slowly, it contracts, as is the case\r\nwith most bodies, and the contraction produces the same effect as\r\nthe decantation; small cavities will be formed, and these will be\r\ntraversed and covered over with distinct crystals. We also observe\r\nthis phenomenon in the geodes of primitive and volcanic mountains, in\r\nwhich the crystals they contain are of the same minerals as those of\r\nwhich the mountains themselves are composed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE E, p. 23.\r\n\r\nON THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOULDER STONES IN SCOTLAND, HOLLAND, GERMANY,\r\nSWITZERLAND, AND AMERICA.\r\n\r\nNumerous large blocks are met with in almost every country of Europe,\r\nand frequently far removed from their original situations. This is\r\nfrequently the case in Scotland: thus, in the Edinburgh district,\r\nwe have numerous blocks of primitive rocks, of which no fixed rocks\r\noccur nearer than in our Highland mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the north of Holland, Germany, and the countries bordering on\r\nthe Baltic, enormous fragments of granite and syenite are scattered\r\nwithin certain limits. According to Humboldt, it seems to be now\r\nproved, that they have been carried southward, with a distribution\r\nlike that of radii from a centre, from the Scandinavian peninsula,\r\nduring some of the ancient revolutions of our globe, and that they\r\nhave not originally belonged to the granitic chains of the Hartz and\r\nSaxony, which they approach without, however, actually attaining\r\ntheir basis[374]. Born, says Humboldt, on the sandy plains of the\r\nBaltic, and until the age of eighteen, not knowing any other rock\r\nthan these scattered blocks, I could not but feel curious to know\r\nwhether the new world presented any thing of a similar nature. I\r\nwas surprised not to find a single block of this description in the\r\n_Llanos_ of Venezuela, although the immense plains were immediately\r\nbordered to the south by a group of mountains entirely granitic[375],\r\nand which presents, in its broken and almost columnar peaks, traces\r\nof the most violent action[376]. Towards the north, the granitic\r\nchain of the Silla of Caracas and of Portocabello is separated from\r\nthe Llanos, by a range of mountains which are schistose between\r\nVilla de Cura and Parapara, and calcareous between the Bergantin and\r\nCaripe. I was equally struck with the same absence of blocks upon the\r\nbanks of the Amazon. La Condamine had already affirmed, that from\r\nthe Pongo of Manseriche to the strait of Pauxis, not the smallest\r\nstone was to be observed. Now, the basin of the Rio Nigro and of\r\nthe Amazon is also but a Llano, a plain like those of Venezuela and\r\nBuenos Ayres, the difference consisting only in the state of the\r\nvegetation. The two Llanos, situated at the northern and southern\r\nextremities of South America, are covered with gramineæ; they are\r\nSavannas destitute of trees. The intermediate Llano, that of the\r\nAmazon, exposed to almost continual equatorial rains, is a thick\r\nforest. I do not remember to have heard that the Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres or the Savannas of the Missouri[377] and New Mexico contain\r\ngranitic blocks. The absence of this phenomenon appears general in\r\nthe new world. It is probably equally so in the Sahara in Africa;\r\nfor we must not confound rocky masses which pierce the soil in the\r\nmidst of the desert, and of which mention has often been made by\r\ntravellers, with mere scattered fragments. These facts seem to prove,\r\nthat the blocks of Scandinavian granite, which cover the sandy plains\r\non the southern side of the Baltic, in Westphalia, and in Holland,\r\nare owing to a particular debacle which proceeded from the north,\r\nto a purely local catastrophe. The old conglomerate (grès rouge),\r\nwhich covers a great part of the Llanos of Venezuela and of the basin\r\nof the Amazon, contains, without doubt, fragments of those same\r\nprimitive rocks of which the neighbouring mountains are composed;\r\nbut the convulsions of which these mountains present undoubted\r\nevidences, do not seem to have been accompanied with circumstances\r\nfavourable to the transportation of great blocks. This geognostic\r\nphenomenon is so much the more unexpected, that nowhere in the world\r\ndoes there exist a plain so continuous, and which is prolonged with\r\nfewer interruptions to the abrupt declivity of a purely granitic\r\ncordillera. Before my departure from Europe, says Humboldt, I had\r\nalready been struck with the observation that there are no primitive\r\nblocks in Lombardy, nor in the great plain of Bavaria, which is the\r\nbottom of an ancient lake, having an elevation of 250 fathoms above\r\nthe level of the ocean. This plain is bounded on the north by the\r\ngranites of the Upper Palatinate, and on the south by the alpine\r\nlimestones, transition clay-slates, and mica-slates of the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nBoulders, or loose blocks of alpine rocks, are found in the lower\r\npart of the Alpine valleys, which terminate in the great principal\r\nvalley that stretches between the Alps and the Jura, from the Lake\r\nof Geneva to the Lake Constance; and are also found almost every\r\nwhere in this great principal valley. They are sometimes met with\r\n4000 feet above the level of the sea, on the side of the Jura, facing\r\nthe Alps, and also in considerable numbers in many of the valleys of\r\nthe Jura itself. These blocks occur only on the surface, never in any\r\nsolid rock, and no one ever met with them in the subjacent strata of\r\nsandstone, marl, or conglomerate of the hills and valleys, interposed\r\nbetween the Alps and the Jura; but they are sometimes found deep in\r\nthe soil, or imbedded or surrounded with the debris formed by rivers.\r\n\r\nThe traveller is often surprised by the enormous magnitude of these\r\nloose blocks, some of them being calculated to contain 50,000 cubic\r\nfeet. The smaller masses are distinguished from those brought down by\r\nrivers, by their position, that is, their occurring on heights and\r\nacclivities, where no river could ever have run. They may also be\r\nconfounded with blocks from decaying conglomerate; hence it is proper\r\nto be on our guard, not only to distinguish these blocks from those\r\nderived from conglomerate rocks, but also from the rolled masses\r\nbelonging to river courses.\r\n\r\nThe height at which they are found does not appear to have any\r\nrelation to their magnitude, for we often find very large blocks at\r\nconsiderable heights, and also in deep valleys; and we also meet with\r\nsmall masses as well in the bottoms of valleys, as high up on the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThey occur sometimes in heaps, or dispersed in single blocks; but\r\nthese relations have no connection with their magnitude, because we\r\noften find large and small masses in the same heap, and single,\r\nlarge, and small, blocks on mountain summits, and in the bottoms of\r\nvalleys. The smaller blocks are more or less rounded, but seldom\r\nso much so as the boulders of rivers, which have been exposed to\r\nlong continued friction. The larger blocks are indeed angular, but\r\nnot sharp edged. But in examining this relation, we must carefully\r\ndistinguish whether or not the angles or edges are original, or have\r\nbeen produced by subsequent, natural, or artificial causes. Very\r\noften masses of this description are blasted with gunpowder, either\r\nwith the view of clearing the fields, or of obtaining stones for\r\nbuilding; and these, if left on the ground, may lead into error.\r\n\r\nThese blocks vary in their nature, some being of the primitive class,\r\nwhile others belong to those of the transition and secondary classes.\r\nIn general, they appertain to rock formations, situated nearer to the\r\ncentral alpine chains than those of the places where they are found.\r\nThus, no rocks of the transition class occur in gneiss valleys; no\r\nalpine limestone in transition valleys; and, in general, nowhere\r\nbut in Jura, do blocks of Jura limestone make their appearance.\r\nTherefore, all the loose blocks of rocks between the Jura and the\r\nAlps, belong to the strata of the high chains of the Alps.\r\n\r\nBut these blocks have different characters in different districts.\r\nThe loose blocks which occur in the river basin of the Rhone, and\r\nthe Lake of Geneva, are quite different from those which lie strewed\r\nabout in the river basin of the Rhine. These, again, are equally\r\ndifferent from the loose blocks of the river basin of the Aare,\r\nas those of the Aare are from the blocks of the Lake of Zurich,\r\nand the valley of Limmat; and these in their turn are equally well\r\ndistinguished from the great accumulations in the valley of the\r\nReuss. It rarely happens that intermixtures take place among these\r\ndifferent accumulations of debris, and this is a circumstance which\r\nmust be attended to in our investigation.\r\n\r\nIt results from an accurate comparison of these loose blocks with\r\nthose mountain rocks which occur in extensive chains in the high\r\nAlps; that the loose blocks of every known river basin agree with\r\nthe rocks which form the sides of the upper parts of those high\r\nAlpine valleys, which are in immediate connection with these great\r\nwater basins. Thus the loose blocks of the water basin of the Rhine\r\nare similar to the rocks of Bundten. We find in the Lake of Zurich,\r\nand in the Limmat valley, the rocks of the Glarner land in loose\r\nblocks. The debris in the basin of the Reuss consists of rocks of the\r\nmountains from which the Reuss takes its rise. The loose blocks of\r\nthe water basin of the Aare are similar to the mountain rocks of the\r\nhigh Alps of Bern; and the loose blocks, found in the course of the\r\nRhone, occur in fixed rocks in the Vallais.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the loose blocks are by no means irregularly\r\ndispersed over the great valley between the Alps and the Jura, but\r\nare distributed in the direction of distinct water basins. It also\r\nappears, that the loose blocks are not irregularly distributed in\r\nthese different basins; on the contrary, that, in some parts of the\r\nbasin, they are accumulated in great numbers; in other places they\r\nare rare, and in some situations none occur.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding observations, we may obtain some hints of\r\nimportance in respect of the cause of this remarkable phenomenon.\r\nThese loose blocks already occur in the alpine valleys, which open\r\ninto the great valley, between the Alps and the Jura. They are found\r\nmore abundantly in the wide parts of valleys immediately below the\r\nnarrow or contracted passes, and few occur in the narrow, steep, and\r\nrocky parts of the valleys.\r\n\r\nLoose blocks are found, at a greater or less height, in the smaller\r\nlateral valleys that open into the transverse alpine valleys, which\r\nterminate in the great valley between the Alps and the Jura. If these\r\nlateral valleys form passes (which lead over into other valleys by\r\na lowering of the high mountain chain), which are not more than\r\n4000 feet above the level of the sea, loose blocks occur, not only\r\nin these passes, but also more or less widely distributed in the\r\nopposite valleys. In the great principal valley which stretches\r\nbetween the Alps and the Jura, from the Lake of Geneva to beyond the\r\nLake Constance, we find these loose blocks dispersed over all the\r\nhills whose elevation is not more than 3000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea; but even here the distribution of the blocks is not entirely\r\nirregular. The largest are found on such hills and acclivities as are\r\nopposite the mouths of the alpine valleys, in the great principal\r\nvalley. The blocks are frequently found higher on such acclivities,\r\nthan on the sides of those valleys which may be considered as a\r\ncontinuation of the alpine valleys. The loose blocks are found every\r\nwhere on that acclivity of the Jura range which is opposite to the\r\nAlps, and they are found highest and largest in those places which\r\nare directly opposite the mouths of the alpine valleys. In such\r\nplaces, the blocks again attain an elevation of nearly 4000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea; whereas, in the intermediate places,\r\nwhich are most remote from the places opposite the mouths of the\r\nalpine valleys, the blocks seldom reach at a height of 2000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn those places where the Jura chain branches into the great valley\r\nbetween the Jura and the Alps, loose blocks are found in the valleys\r\nbehind the projecting chains. The Jura range is sometimes intersected\r\nin places opposite to the Alps; and it is remarked, that loose blocks\r\nare met with in the valleys behind these intersected portions of\r\nthe range; and that, when loose blocks occur in the Jura range, at\r\na distance from the Alps, it is only in such places as are directly\r\nopposite to the intersected portions of the chain opposite to the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of the non-occurrence of these blocks in the\r\nsandstone, marl, and nagelfluh, which occupy the great valley between\r\nthe Alps and the Jura, proves that that revolution of our globe, by\r\nwhich these were dispersed, took place after the formation of these\r\nrocks, and may therefore have belonged to one of the latest changes\r\nwhich have contributed to the present form of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the relations of the alluvium of the rivers in\r\nvalleys with those of the loose blocks, their similarity must strike\r\nevery one. Thus, rolled masses are seldom deposited in those places\r\nwhere a river forces its way through a narrow passage; but where an\r\nexpansion takes place, owing to the distance of the banks increasing,\r\nthe rolled masses are sometimes accumulated in whole banks. The same\r\nloose blocks seldom occur in the narrow passages of the transverse\r\nvalleys in the Alps; but as soon as widenings of the valleys take\r\nplace below these narrowings, the blocks occur in abundance.\r\n\r\nIf, during a flood, a rupture takes place in the banks of a river,\r\nwhere it is contracted, a part of the stream will flow out by the\r\nlateral opening, and carry along with it rolled masses, even when the\r\nopening in the bank does not reach to the bottom of the bed of the\r\nriver; for the mountain stream, loaded with boulders, carries them\r\nnot merely in single masses along its bottom, but the flood-water\r\nof the stream generally attacks large sandbanks, or older beds of\r\nrolled masses, and carries along with it, accompanied with a terrible\r\nnoise, whole masses, forces them over the lower banks, or through the\r\nchasm in the bank, and often deposites them several feet high, on an\r\nimmediately succeeding widening of the river’s course.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, we observe loose blocks deposited on high\r\nsituations in the lateral valleys of the great transverse valleys,\r\nand dispersed over the passes into the neighbouring valleys. The\r\nheight of the lateral deposites of loose blocks, and their position\r\nin the passes, and their passing into neighbouring valleys, are facts\r\nwhich assist us in judging of the extent of the power that may have\r\nacted during their transportation.\r\n\r\nThe striking agreement observable in the phenomena of the\r\ndistribution of the loose blocks from the interior Alpine valleys to\r\nthe interior valleys of the Jura, with those in the rolled masses\r\ncarried along by rivers, must lead every one, who reflects on this\r\ninteresting phenomenon, to the hypothesis, that these blocks may have\r\nbeen deposited in their present situations by an overwhelming flood,\r\nwhich burst from the Alps. It is true that this opinion is liable to\r\nmany objections; but still it contains a more plausible explanation\r\nof the phenomenon than any other with which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe loose blocks, in the different river-districts, being in general\r\nseparated from each other, or if any intermixture takes place of the\r\nrolled masses of one valley with that of another, it being only on\r\ntheir edges, it is highly probable that the floods which burst from\r\nthese valleys, and carried along with them the masses of rocks, may\r\nhave been simultaneous, by which the flow of the one basin would\r\nbound and limit that of the other, and thus prevent the water-flood\r\nof one basin flowing into the neighbouring ones.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaneous occurrence of these different floods from the\r\nAlpine valleys, can alone, on this hypothesis, explain why this\r\naqueous flood was so generally and so highly accumulated in the great\r\nvalleys between the Alps and the Jura, as to reach the height of most\r\nof the sandstone mountains, and to a great elevation in the Jura,\r\nwhere many blocks are found deposited. But if the contemporaneous\r\noccurrence of these floods is proved by the facts already enumerated,\r\nto what cause are we to refer this simultaneous bursting of floods of\r\nwater from so many Alpine valleys?\r\n\r\nWe observe, on the north-western side of the chain of the Alps,\r\nnumerous openings, which, by their structure, seem to point out the\r\naction of violent floods. Let us suppose the numerous valleys, in the\r\ndistricts already described, closed at their present entrances, or\r\nopenings, as would seem from their structure to have been formerly\r\nthe case; the consequence of this arrangement would be the filling\r\nof the Alpine valleys with water, to the height of the lowest passes\r\namong the mountains, and thus an enormous accumulation of water\r\nwould take place. This great body of water, if let loose at once, by\r\nthe bursting of the lower extremities of the valleys, would form a\r\nflood which would sweep across the sandstone mountains, between the\r\nAlps and the Jura range, and even ascend high on the Jura itself.\r\nThis flood of water, moving, probably, at the rate of 200 feet in a\r\nsecond, and loaded with debris of rocks, would carry masses, even\r\nthese having a magnitude of 50,000 cubical feet, some thousand feet\r\nhigh, on the Jura range[378]. Geologists maintain, that the blocks\r\nor boulders met with in other countries, and arranged as those in\r\nSwitzerland, have been deposited where we now find them, by the\r\nbursting of lakes; while those found on the shores of the Baltic, are\r\nconjectured to have been transported by a great rush of water caused\r\nby the sudden elevation of the land of Scandinavia. Another opinion\r\nhas its advocates, which maintains that these boulders have been\r\nspread over different countries by the waters of the _deluge_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE F, p. 26.\r\n\r\nON THE ALLUVIAL LAND OF THE DANISH ISLANDS IN THE BALTIC, AND ON THE\r\nCOAST OF SLESWIGH.\r\n\r\nIn this section, Cuvier gives a clear and distinct account of several\r\nkinds of alluvial formations. M. De Luc, in the first volume of his\r\nGeological Travels, describes the alluvial formations that cover\r\nand bound many of the islands in the Baltic, and upon the coast of\r\nDenmark, and gives so interesting an account of the modes followed by\r\nthe inhabitants, in preserving these alluvial deposites, that we feel\r\npleasure in communicating it to our readers.\r\n\r\n  “During my stay at Husum, I had the advantage of passing my\r\n  evenings very agreeably and profitably at the house of M.\r\n  Hartz, with his own family, and two Danish officers, Major\r\n  Behmann, commandant at Husum, and Captain Baron de Barackow. The\r\n  conversation often turned on the objects of my excursions, and\r\n  particularly on the natural history of the _coasts_ and of the\r\n  _islands_; respecting which, M. Hartz obligingly undertook to\r\n  give me extracts from the chronicles of the country. This led\r\n  us to speak of the Danish islands; and those officers giving me\r\n  such descriptions of them, as were very interesting to my object,\r\n  I begged their permission to write down, in their presence, the\r\n  principal circumstances which they communicated to me. These will\r\n  form the first addition to my own observations; I shall afterwards\r\n  proceed to the information which I obtained from M. Hartz.\r\n\r\n  The two principal islands of the Danish Archipelago, those of\r\n  Funen and Seeland (or Zeeland), as well as some small islands\r\n  in the Kattegate, namely, Lenoe, Anholt, and Samsoe, are hilly,\r\n  and principally composed of _geest_[379]; and in these are found\r\n  _gravel_ and _blocks of granite_, and of other stones of that\r\n  class, exactly in the same manner as in the country which I have\r\n  lately described, and its _islands_ in the North Sea. On the\r\n  borders of the two first of these Danish islands, there are also\r\n  _blocks_ in the sea; but only in front of _abrupt_ coasts, as is\r\n  the case with the islands of Poel and Rugen, and along the coasts\r\n  of the Baltic. The lands added to these islands of _geest_ are in\r\n  most part composed of the _sand_ of the sea, the land-waters there\r\n  being very inconsiderable; and to the south of them have been\r\n  formed several islands of the same nature, the chief of which are\r\n  Laland and Falster, near Seeland. These, like the marsh islands\r\n  in the North Sea, are sand-banks accumulated by the waves, and,\r\n  when covered with grass, continuing to be farther raised by the\r\n  sediments deposited between its blades. In the Baltic, where there\r\n  are no sensible tides, such islands may be inhabited without dikes,\r\n  as well as the extensions of the coasts; because, being raised to\r\n  the highest level of that sea, while their declivity under water\r\n  is very small, and being also more firm in their composition, the\r\n  waves die away on their shores; and if, in any extraordinary case,\r\n  the sea rises over them, it leaves on them fresh deposits, which\r\n  increase their heights. These soils are all perfectly _horizontal_,\r\n  like those added to the coasts of the Continent.\r\n\r\n  Some of these islands approach entirely, or in part, to the nature\r\n  of that of Rugen. This island of Seeland, on that side which is\r\n  called Hedding, has a promontory composed of strata of _chalk_\r\n  with its flints. The island of Moen (or Mona), on the south of\r\n  the latter, has a similar promontory near Maglebye and Mandemark;\r\n  and the island of Bornholm, the easternmost of those belonging\r\n  to Denmark, contains strata of _coal_, covered by others of\r\n  _sandstone_. Phenomena like these, evident symptoms of the most\r\n  violent catastrophes at the bottom of the ancient sea, proceeding,\r\n  as I think I have clearly shewn, from the subsidence and angular\r\n  motions of large masses of strata, which must have forced out the\r\n  interior fluids with the utmost impetuosity, it is not surprising\r\n  that so many fragments of the lowermost strata are found dispersed\r\n  over this great theatre of ruins.\r\n\r\n  I now proceed to the details which I received from M. Hartz;\r\n  beginning by a specific designation of the _islands_ dependent on\r\n  the province of Sleswigh, such as they are at present, belonging\r\n  to the three classes already defined. To commence from the north;\r\n  Fanoe, Rom, Sylt, and Amrom, were originally _islands_ of the\r\n  same nature as the neighbouring continent, but have been since\r\n  extended by _marsches_[380]. The soil of these islands, with its\r\n  gravel and blocks of primordial stones, was at first barren, as\r\n  the _geest_ is naturally every where; but is become fertile by\r\n  manure, of which there has been no deficiency, since those grounds\r\n  have been surrounded with _marsch_, where the cattle are kept in\r\n  stables during the winter. In the island of Sylt, there are spaces\r\n  consisting of _moor_, but its head of land, which extends on the\r\n  south as far as Mornum, is composed entirely of _marsch_, and is\r\n  bordered with _dunes_ towards the open sea, because, the sediments\r\n  of the rivers not reaching any farther, the _sea-sand_ impelled\r\n  against it by the waves remains pure, and is thus raised by the\r\n  winds in hillocks on the shore. The shallow bottom of the sea,\r\n  between this island and that of Fora, is of _geest_: at low water,\r\n  it may be passed over on foot; and there are found on it gravel\r\n  and blocks of _granite_. But on the same side of Fora there is a\r\n  great extent of _marsch_, beginning from St Laurencius. Among the\r\n  islands consisting entirely of _marsch_ and surrounded with dikes,\r\n  the most considerable are Pellworm and Nord Strand; and among the\r\n  Halligs, or those inhabited without dikes, the chief are Olant,\r\n  Nord-marsh, Langne, Groode, and Hooge.\r\n\r\n  Such are the islands on this coast, in their present state, now\r\n  rendered permanent by the degree of perfection at which the\r\n  art of dike-making is arrived. But, in former times, though\r\n  the _original_ land was never attacked by the _sea_, which, by\r\n  adding to it _new lands_, soon formed a barrier against its own\r\n  encroachments, the latter, and the _islands_ composed of the same\r\n  materials, were subject to great and sudden changes, very fatal\r\n  to those who were engaged to settle on them by the richness of\r\n  their soil, comparatively with the continental. The inhabitants,\r\n  who continued to multiply on them during several generations, were\r\n  taught, indeed, by experience, that they might at last be invaded\r\n  by the element which was incessantly threatening them; but having\r\n  as yet no knowledge of natural causes, they blindly considered\r\n  those that endangered them as supernatural, and for a long time\r\n  used no precautions for their own security. They were ignorant of\r\n  the dreadful effects of a certain association of circumstances,\r\n  rare indeed, but, when occurring, absolutely destructive of these\r\n  _marsches_. This association consists of an extraordinary elevation\r\n  of the level of the North Sea, from the long continuance of certain\r\n  winds in the Atlantic, with a violent storm occurring during the\r\n  tides of the new or full moon; for then the sea rises above the\r\n  level of all the _marsches_; and before they were secured against\r\n  such attacks, the waves rolling over them, and tearing away the\r\n  grass which had bound their surface, they were reduced to the state\r\n  of mere banks of sand and mud, whence they had been drawn, by the\r\n  long course of ordinary causes. Such were the dreadful accidents\r\n  to which the first settlers on these lands were exposed; but no\r\n  sooner were they over, than ordinary causes began again to act; the\r\n  sand-banks rose; their surface was covered with grass; the coast\r\n  was thus extended, and new islands were formed; time effaced the\r\n  impression of past misfortunes; and those among the inhabitants of\r\n  these dangerous soils, who had been able to save themselves on the\r\n  coast, ventured to return to settle on them again, and had time to\r\n  multiply, before the recurrence of the same catastrophes.\r\n\r\n  This has been the general course of events on all the coasts of the\r\n  North Sea, and particularly on those of the countries of Sleswigh\r\n  and Holstein. It is thus that the origin and progress of the _art\r\n  of dikes_ will supply us with a very interesting _chronometer_ in\r\n  the history of the continent and of man, particularly exemplified\r\n  in this part of the globe. A Lutheran clergyman, settled in the\r\n  island of Nord Strand, having collected all the particulars of\r\n  this history which the documents of the country could afford,\r\n  published it in 1668, in a German work, entitled _The North Frisian\r\n  Chronicle_. It was chiefly from this work, and from the _Chronicle\r\n  of Dankwerth_, that M. Hartz extracted the information which he\r\n  gave to me, accompanied by two maps, copied for me, by one of his\r\n  sons, from those of Johannes Mayerus, a mathematician; they bear\r\n  the title of _Frisia Cimbrica_; one of them respecting the state of\r\n  the _islands_ and of the _coast_, in 1240, as it may be traced in\r\n  the chronicles, and the other, as it was in 1651.\r\n\r\n  According to these documents, the first inhabitants of the\r\n  _marsches_ were _Frisii_ or _Frisians_, designated also under\r\n  the names of _Cimbri_ and _Sicambri_: the latter name, M.\r\n  Hartz conjectures, might come from the ancient German words\r\n  _Seekampfers_, i. e. _Sea-warriors_; the _Frisians_ being very\r\n  warlike. These people appear to have had the same origin with\r\n  those, who, at a rather earlier period, took possession of the\r\n  _marsches_ of Ost-Frise (East-Friesland), and of that Friesland\r\n  which forms one of the United Provinces; but this common origin\r\n  is very obscure. Even at the present day, the inhabitants of the\r\n  _marsches_, from near Husum to Tondern, or Tunder to the North,\r\n  though themselves unacquainted with it, speak a language which\r\n  the other inhabitants of the country do not understand, and which\r\n  is supposed to be Frisian. It is the same at a village in the\r\n  peninsula of Bremen, by which I have had occasion to pass.\r\n\r\n  The _Sicambri_ or _North Frisians_, are traced back to some\r\n  centuries before the Christian era. At the commencement of that\r\n  era, they were attacked by Frotho, King of Denmark, and lost\r\n  a battle, under their king Vicho, near the river Hever. Four\r\n  centuries afterwards they joined the troops of Hengist and Horsa.\r\n  In the year 692, their king Radebot resided in the island of\r\n  Heiligeland. Charles Martel subdued them in 732; and some time\r\n  afterwards they joined Charlemagne against Gottric, King of\r\n  Denmark. These are some of the circumstances of the history of this\r\n  Frisian colony, recorded in the chronicles of which I have spoken;\r\n  but the history here interesting to us is that of the lands whereon\r\n  they settled.\r\n\r\n  It appears that these people did not arrive here in one body,\r\n  but successively, in the course of many years: they spread\r\n  themselves over various parts of the coasts of the North Sea, and\r\n  even a considerable way up the borders of the Weser and the Elbe;\r\n  according to documents which I have mentioned in my _Lettres sur\r\n  l’Histoire de la Terre et de l’Homme_. These new settlers found\r\n  large _marsches_, formed, as well in the wide mouths of those\r\n  rivers as along the coasts, and around the original islands of\r\n  _geest_; especially that of Heiligeland, the most distant from the\r\n  coast, and opposite the mouth of the Eyder. Of this island, which\r\n  is steep towards the south, the original mass consists of strata\r\n  of _sandstone_; and at that time its _marsch_ extended almost to\r\n  Eyderstede: there were _marsches_ likewise around all the other\r\n  original islands; besides very large islands of pure _marsch_ in\r\n  the intervals of the former.\r\n\r\n  All these lands were desert at the arrival of the Frisians; and\r\n  the parts on which they established their first habitations, to\r\n  take care of their breeds of horses and cattle feeding on the\r\n  _marsches_, were the original eminences of the islands; on that of\r\n  Heiligeland they built a temple to their great goddess Phoseta, or\r\n  Fosta. When they became too numerous to confine themselves to the\r\n  heights, their herds being also greatly multiplied, they ventured\r\n  to begin inhabiting the _marsches_; but afterwards, some great\r\n  inundations having shewn them the dangers of that situation, they\r\n  adopted the practice followed by those who had settled on the\r\n  _marsches_ of the province of Groningen, and still continued on the\r\n  Halligs; that of raising artificial mounts called _werfs_, on which\r\n  they built their houses, and whither they could, upon occasion,\r\n  withdraw their herds; and it likewise appears, that, in the\r\n  winter, they assembled in greater numbers on the spots originally\r\n  the highest, in the islands, as well as on some parts of the coasts.\r\n\r\n  Things continued in this state for several centuries; during which\r\n  period, it is probable that the inhabitants of these lands were\r\n  often, by various catastrophes, disturbed in the enjoyment of them,\r\n  though not discouraged. But in 516, by which time these people were\r\n  become very numerous, more than 600 of them perished by one of the\r\n  concurrences of fatal circumstances already defined. It was then\r\n  that they undertook the astonishing enterprise of enclosing these\r\n  lands. They dug ditches around all the _marsches_, heaping up on\r\n  their exterior edge the earth which was taken out; and thus they\r\n  opposed to the sea, dikes of eight feet in height. After this,\r\n  comprehending that nothing could contribute more to the safety of\r\n  their dwellings, than to remove the sea to a greater distance,\r\n  they undertook, with that view, to exclude it from the intervals\r\n  between the islands, by uniting, as far as should be possible,\r\n  those islands with each other. I will describe the process by which\r\n  they effected this, after I shall have recalled to attention some\r\n  circumstances leading to it.\r\n\r\n  From all that I have already said of the _fore-lands_, and of the\r\n  manner in which they are increased, it may be understood, that\r\n  the common effects of the _waves_ and of the _tides_ is to bring\r\n  materials from the bottom of the sea towards the coasts; and\r\n  that the process continues in every state of the sea. The land\r\n  winds produce no _waves_ on the coasts, which can carry back to\r\n  the bottom of the sea what has been brought thence by the winds\r\n  blowing against the shore; and as for the _tides_, it may have\r\n  been already comprehended (and shall soon be proved), that the\r\n  _ebb_ carries back but very little of what has been brought by the\r\n  _flood_. So that, but for some extraordinary circumstances, the\r\n  materials continually impelled towards the shore, which first form\r\n  islands, would at last unite against the coast in a continuous\r\n  soil. The rare events, productive of great catastrophes, do not\r\n  carry back these materials towards the bottom of the sea; they\r\n  only, as it has been said before, ravage the surface, diminishing\r\n  the heights, and destroying the effect of vegetation. These, then,\r\n  were the effects against which it was necessary to guard.\r\n\r\n  I now come to the plan of uniting the _islands_, formed by these\r\n  early inhabitants. They availed themselves for that purpose of\r\n  all such parts of the sand-banks as lay in the intervals between\r\n  the large islands, and were beginning to produce grass. These,\r\n  when surrounded with dikes, are what are called _Hoogs_; and\r\n  their effects are to break the waves, thus diminishing their\r\n  action against the dikes of the large islands, and, at the same\r\n  time, to determine the accumulation of the mud in the intervals\r\n  between those islands. In this manner a large _marsch_ island,\r\n  named Everschop, was already, in 987, united to Eyderstede by the\r\n  point on which Poppenbull is situated; and in 995, the union of\r\n  the same _marsches_ was effected by another point, namely, that\r\n  of Tetenbull. Lastly, in the year 1000, Eyderstede received a\r\n  new increase by the course of the Hever, prolonged between the\r\n  sand banks, being fixed by a dike; but the whole still remained\r\n  an _island_. This is an example of the manner in which the\r\n  _marsch_ islands were united by the _hoogs_; and the chronicle of\r\n  the country says, that, by these labours, the islands were so\r\n  considerably enlarged in size, and the intervals between them so\r\n  much raised, that, at low water, it was possible to pass on foot\r\n  from one to the other. The extent of these _marsches_ was so great\r\n  on the coast of Sleswigh alone, that they were divided into three\r\n  provinces, two of which comprehended the islands, and the third\r\n  comprised the _marsches_ contiguous to the coast; and the same\r\n  works were carried on upon the _marsches_ of the coast of Holstein.\r\n\r\n  But the grounds thus gained from the sand-banks were very\r\n  insecure; these people, though they had inhabited them more than\r\n  ten centuries, had not yet understood the possibility of that\r\n  combination of fatal circumstances above described, against which\r\n  their dikes formed but a very feeble rampart; the North Sea, by the\r\n  extraordinary elevations of its level, being much more formidable\r\n  in this respect than the ocean, where the changes of absolute level\r\n  are much less considerable. I shall give an abridged account of the\r\n  particulars extracted by M. Hartz from the chronicle of Dankwerth,\r\n  relative to the great catastrophes which these _marsches_\r\n  successively underwent, previously to the time when experience led\r\n  to the means necessary for their security.\r\n\r\n  In 1075, the island of Nord Strand, then contiguous to the coast,\r\n  particularly experienced the effect of that unusual combination\r\n  of destructive causes; the sea passing over its dike, and forming\r\n  within it large excavations like lakes. In 1114 and 1158,\r\n  considerable parts of Eyderstede were carried away; and in 1204,\r\n  the part called Sudhever in the _marsch_ of Uthholm was destroyed.\r\n  All these catastrophes were fatal to many of the _marsch_ settlers;\r\n  but in 1216, the sea having risen so high that its waves passed\r\n  over Nord Strand, Eyderstede, and Ditmarsch, near 10,000 of their\r\n  inhabitants perished. Again, in 1300, seven parishes in Nord Strand\r\n  and Pellworm were destroyed; and in 1338, Ditmarsch experienced a\r\n  new catastrophe, which swept away a great part of it on the side\r\n  next Eyderstede: the dike of the course of the Eyder between the\r\n  sand-banks was demolished, and the tides have ever since preserved\r\n  their course throughout that wide space. Lastly, in the year 1362,\r\n  the isles of Fora and Sylt, then forming but one, were divided, and\r\n  Nord Strand, then a _marsch_ united to the coast, was separated\r\n  from it.\r\n\r\n  During a long time, the inhabitants who survived these\r\n  catastrophes, and their successors, were so much discouraged,\r\n  that they attempted nothing more than to surround with _dikes_\r\n  like the former such spaces of their meadow-land as appeared the\r\n  least exposed to these ravages, leaving the rest to its fate. But\r\n  the common course of causes continually tending to extend and to\r\n  raise the grassy parts of the sand-banks, and no extraordinary\r\n  combination of circumstances having interrupted these natural\r\n  operations, later generations, farther advanced in the arts,\r\n  undertook to secure to themselves the possession of those new\r\n  grounds. In 1525, they turned their attention to the indentations\r\n  made, during the preceding catastrophes, in the borders of the\r\n  _marsches_; the waves, confined in these narrow spaces, sometimes\r\n  threatening to cut their way into the interior part. In the front\r\n  of all the creeks of this kind they planted stakes, which they\r\n  interlaced with osiers, leaving a certain space between the lines.\r\n  The waves, thus broken, could no longer do injury to the _marsch_;\r\n  and their sediments being deposited on both sides of this open\r\n  fence, very solid _fore-lands_ were there formed. In 1550, they\r\n  raised the _dikes_ considerably higher, employing wheelbarrows, the\r\n  use of which was only then introduced. For this purpose, they much\r\n  enlarged and deepened the interior canals, in order to obtain more\r\n  earth, not merely to add to the height of the dikes, but to extend\r\n  their base on the outer side. At last they began to cover these\r\n  dikes with straw-ropes; but this great preservative of dikes was at\r\n  first ill managed; and the use of it was so slowly spread, that it\r\n  was not adopted in North Strand and in Eyderstede, till about the\r\n  years 1610 and 1612.\r\n\r\n  Before that time, however, the safety of the extensive soil of\r\n  the latter _marsch_ had been provided for in a different manner.\r\n  I have said above, that, when the isles of Everschop and Utholm\r\n  had been united to it, the whole together still formed but one\r\n  large _island_; now, in this state, it was in as great danger\r\n  on the side towards the continent, as on that open to the sea;\r\n  because two small rivers, the Trene and the Nord Eyder, discharging\r\n  themselves into the interval between it and the land, and by\r\n  preserving their course to the sea, this interval was thus kept\r\n  open to tempest, sometimes from the side of the Hever, sometimes\r\n  from that of the Eyder; and the waves, beating against the _geest_,\r\n  were thence repelled upon the _marsch_. The inhabitants, seeing\r\n  that the expence of remedying these evils would be greater than\r\n  they could afford, while at the same time it was indispensable to\r\n  their safety, addressed themselves to their bishop and to their\r\n  prefect, of whom they requested pecuniary assistance; and having\r\n  obtained it they first undertook the great enterprise of carrying\r\n  the Trene and the Nord Eyder higher up into the Eyder; keeping\r\n  their waters, however, still separate for a certain space, by a\r\n  _dam_ with a _sluice_, in order to form there a reservoir of fresh\r\n  water; the tides ascending up the Eyder above Frederickstadt.\r\n  They were thus enabled to carry on the extremities of the _dike_\r\n  on both sides to join the _geest_; and the interval between the\r\n  latter and the _marsch_ was then soon filled up, there being only\r\n  left at their junction the canal above described which receives\r\n  the water of the _geest_, and, at low water, discharges them from\r\n  both its extremities by sluices. At the same time, the islands of\r\n  Pellworm and Nord Strand were united with each other by means of\r\n  eight _hoogs_; and the _sandy marsches_ of which I have spoken,\r\n  contiguous to the _geest_, on the north of that of Husum, were\r\n  inclosed with dikes.\r\n\r\n  After the dikes had been thus elevated, and their surface\r\n  rendered firm by the straw ropes, though the latter were not yet\r\n  properly fixed, the inhabitants of the _marsches_ for some time\r\n  enjoyed repose; but on the 11th October 1634, the sea, rising\r\n  to an excessive height, carried away, during a great tempest,\r\n  the _hoogs_ which had produced the junction between Pellworm and\r\n  Nord Strand, these having ever since continued distinct islands;\r\n  it also violently attacked Ditmarsch; and its ravages extended\r\n  over the whole coast, as far as the very extensive new lands of\r\n  Jutland. Princes then came forward zealously to the relief of\r\n  their subjects. In particular, Frederick III., Duke of Sleswigh,\r\n  seeing that the inhabitants of Nord Strand were deficient both\r\n  in the talents and in the means necessary for the reparation and\r\n  future security of that large island, and knowing that the art\r\n  of dikes had made greater progress in Holland, because of the\r\n  opulence of the country, addressed himself to the States-General,\r\n  requesting them to send him an engineer of dikes, with workmen\r\n  accustomed to repair them; and this was granted. The dikes of Nord\r\n  Strand were then repaired in the most solid manner; and the Dutch\r\n  engineer, seeing the fertility of its soil, advised his sons upon\r\n  his death-bed, to purchase lands and settle there, if the Duke\r\n  would grant them the free exercise of their religion; they being\r\n  Jansenist catholics, and the inhabitants of the island Lutherans.\r\n  The Duke agreed to this, on condition that they and their posterity\r\n  should continue to superintend the works carried on upon the\r\n  dikes; to which they engaged themselves. From that time the art of\r\n  dikes, and particularly that part of it which consists in covering\r\n  them solidly with straw, has become common to all the _marsches_;\r\n  and the Dutch families, which have contributed to this fortunate\r\n  change, continue to inhabit the same island, and to enjoy the free\r\n  exercise of their religion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE G, p. 28.\r\n\r\nON THE SAND-FLOOD.\r\n\r\nIn different parts of Scotland, as in Aberdeenshire, Hebrides, and\r\nShetland Islands, there are examples of the natural chronometer\r\nmentioned in the text. In Morayshire there is a striking example of\r\nthe sand-flood, concerning which the following details have been\r\nfurnished by my young friend the Rev. Mr Ritchie.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sand-Flood in Morayshire._\r\n\r\n  “Westward from the mouth of the river Findhorn in Morayshire, a\r\n  district, consisting of upwards of ten square miles of land, which,\r\n  owing to its extreme fertility, was once termed the Granary of\r\n  Moray, has been depopulated and rendered utterly unproductive by\r\n  the sand-flood. This barren waste may be characterised as hilly;\r\n  the accumulations of sand composing these hills frequently varying\r\n  in their height, and changing their situation.\r\n\r\n  There is historical evidence, that, in the year 1097, the Moray\r\n  Firth overflowed the low country on its southern shore, and threw\r\n  out sand. But the destruction of the barony of Coubine (which\r\n  includes the greater part of the desert mentioned above) was long\r\n  subsequent to this, as might be proved from the inscription on a\r\n  tombstone in the church yard of Dyke. From historical notices,\r\n  also, in regard to the Kinnairds of Coubine, preparing for\r\n  publication, it appears that the eruption of sand commenced about\r\n  the year 1677; that its progress was gradual; that, in 1697, not a\r\n  vestige was to be seen of the manor-place, orchards, and offices\r\n  of Coubine; that two-thirds of the barony were already ruined, and\r\n  that the sand was daily gaining ground.\r\n\r\n  This sand, which overwhelmed Coubine, came from Mavieston,\r\n  situated on the shore, about seven miles west from the mouth of\r\n  the Findhorn, where, from time immemorial, there have been large\r\n  accumulations of sand. The sands at Mavieston had formerly been\r\n  covered with vegetation. In an act of the Scottish Parliament,\r\n  dated 16th July 1695, for the preservation of lands adjacent to\r\n  sand-hills, it is stated, that the destruction of Coubine “was\r\n  occasioned by the bad practice of pulling bent and juniper.” Having\r\n  been thus set at liberty, the sand moved towards the north-east, as\r\n  appears from the desolation which marks its progress. The moving\r\n  cause is the wind. I have had opportunities of witnessing the\r\n  effect of the wind on the loose sand. When the breeze is moderate\r\n  it carries along with it successive waves of sand, each wave (if I\r\n  may be allowed the expression) being of a small size, and moving\r\n  with greater or less velocity, in proportion to the strength of the\r\n  breeze, and presenting a very beautiful appearance. When the wind\r\n  is high the heavier particles are drifted forwards, the more minute\r\n  are raised to a considerable height in the atmosphere, occasioning\r\n  no small inconvenience to the spectator, who finds his ears and\r\n  nostrils filled with sand. The movements of the sand are still\r\n  towards the north-east. In the winter of 1816 a large portion of\r\n  Binsness, the only remaining farm on the west side of the Findhorn,\r\n  situated in the line of the sand’s progress, was overwhelmed.\r\n  Since that period large accumulations of sand have disappeared\r\n  altogether, and rich soil, marked with the plough, has been left\r\n  bare, after having been buried for upwards of a century.\r\n\r\n  The very minute particles, which, as has been stated, the wind\r\n  raises to a considerable height, are occasionally carried across\r\n  the Bay of Findhorn. In the statistical account of Dyke, the parish\r\n  in which Coubine is situated, it is said, “that, at the town of\r\n  Findern, in a blowing day, one may feel the sand sharply striking\r\n  on his face, from the west side.” This sand, of extreme fineness,\r\n  is to be seen in and around the town of Findhorn, and along the\r\n  coast much rich land is said to have been covered by sand brought\r\n  from the west.\r\n\r\n  The greater quantity of the sand is drifted into the river, and its\r\n  effects have been very remarkable. Many years ago the mouth of the\r\n  river having become blocked up with sand, it cut out for itself\r\n  its present channel, which conducts it, by a more direct course,\r\n  to the sea. In consequence of this, the old town of Findhorn had\r\n  changed its situation, from the east to the west side of the\r\n  river, and its site has since been covered by the sea. Previous\r\n  to this, however, the inhabitants, carrying with them the stones\r\n  of their former houses, had removed across the river, and erected\r\n  the present village. On the retiring of the tide from the bay,\r\n  the river almost disappears, being swallowed up by the sand, and\r\n  quick-sands are formed. The effect resulting from the same cause,\r\n  the drifting in of the sand is very different at high water. In\r\n  consequence of the channel of the river having been filled up, the\r\n  bay has increased in breadth. The sand constantly carried down by\r\n  the river has formed a bar, which prevents the entrance of large\r\n  vessels; and the river, probably owing to its increased breadth,\r\n  and this bar depriving it of the impetus acquired in the course\r\n  of its descent, is, at spring-tides, unable to force its way into\r\n  the sea, when it is made to flow back, and inundate a considerable\r\n  extent of carse-land situated at the head of the bay. It was at one\r\n  time proposed to render the river navigable by dredging. And it is\r\n  proposed to endeavour to save the adjoining carse-land, which is of\r\n  the richest quality, from the monthly inundation to which it is at\r\n  present subject, by building a wall along the river side.\r\n\r\n  I venture to suggest, that the plan Nature employs for fettering\r\n  down sand should first be imitated, and that seeds of the Arundo\r\n  arenaria, Elymus arenarius, and other plants, which grow readily\r\n  in sand, should be, from time to time, strewed over the Mavieston\r\n  Hills. The seeds of the Arundo arenaria are not always to be had;\r\n  but plants might easily be procured in abundance, and be dibbled\r\n  into the sand-hills. The circumstance of great accumulations of\r\n  sand having of late disappeared from Coubine, has given rise\r\n  to the expectation, that the barony is at no distant period to\r\n  become again serviceable to man. By cutting off fresh supplies\r\n  from Mavieston, this period would be accelerated, and the proposed\r\n  improvements rendered comparatively easy.\r\n\r\n  There is at present little bent on Coubine. It is chiefly confined\r\n  to a range of knolls, which forms the southern boundary of the\r\n  sand, and protects the adjoining cultivated fields from its\r\n  encroachments; and yet, notwithstanding the terrible calamity\r\n  the inhabitants of Moray brought upon themselves, by the pulling\r\n  of bent, this “bad practice” still prevails; this plant being in\r\n  no other district of country which I have visited so generally\r\n  employed for thatching cottars’ houses, and other economical\r\n  purposes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Outer Hebrides the effects of the sand-flood are also\r\nconsiderable, as shewn in the following notice communicated by my\r\nintelligent assistant Mr Macgillivray.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sand-Flood in the Hebrides, and other parts of Scotland._\r\n\r\n  “The bottom of the sea, along the whole west coast of the Outer\r\n  Hebrides, from Barray Head to the Butt of the Lewis, appears to\r\n  consist of sand. Along the shores of these islands this sand\r\n  appears here and there, in patches of several miles, separated\r\n  by intervals of rock, of equal or greater extent. In some places\r\n  the sandy shores are flat, or very gently sloping, forming what\r\n  are here called Fords; in others, behind the beach, there is an\r\n  accumulation of sand to the height of from twenty to sixty feet,\r\n  formed into hillocks. This sand is constantly drifting; and in\r\n  several places islands have been formed by the removal of isthmi.\r\n  The parts immediately behind the beach are also liable to be\r\n  inundated by the sand; and in this manner most of the islands have\r\n  suffered very considerable damage. Those of Pabbay and Berneray in\r\n  Harris may be particularised; in the former of which, a tract of\r\n  about a mile and a-half long, by half a mile in breadth, has been\r\n  converted into a desert of drifting sand; and in the latter a large\r\n  plain, that was formerly noted for its fertility, has been entirely\r\n  swept away. The sand consists almost entirely of comminuted shells,\r\n  apparently of the species which are found in the neighbouring seas.\r\n  It is rather coarse in the grain; but, during high winds, by the\r\n  rubbing of its particles upon each other, a sort of dust is formed,\r\n  which, at a distance, resembles smoke, and which, in the Island\r\n  of Berneray, I have seen driven into the sea, to the distance of\r\n  upwards of two miles, appearing like a thin white fog. The cure of\r\n  sand drift has been attempted in these islands in two different\r\n  ways. Mr Alexander Macleod, surgeon of North Uist, is the inventor\r\n  of the most efficacious method, which is that of cutting thin\r\n  square turfs from the neighbouring pasture grounds, and laying them\r\n  down at intervals of some inches. In the course of a very few years\r\n  the turfs coalesce, and the stript ground is little the worse; for\r\n  the roots remaining in it, a new vegetation rapidly springs up. The\r\n  other method was introduced by Mr Macleod of Harris, and tried\r\n  extensively upon his estate. It consists of planting small bundles\r\n  of Arundo arenaria, at distances of about a foot and a-half. These\r\n  take root, and prevent the drifting to a certain degree. But often\r\n  vegetation is tardy in establishing itself, and if the turf plan\r\n  be not considerably more expensive, it seems preferable, because\r\n  it very effectually prevents the drift, and moreover, produces\r\n  excellent pasture ground; the former of which indications, the\r\n  planting system, does not completely effect, and the latter in a\r\n  very imperfect degree.”\r\n\r\nWe may add, as this subject is a very interesting one, that further\r\ndetails, in regard to the moving sands of Scotland, will be found,\r\non consulting the Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. xx. p. 220.\r\nIn the Appendix to the Account of the parish of Dyke, vol. xx. p.\r\n228. _et seq._ there is an account of the Sand-Hills of Mavieston,\r\nwhich overwhelmed the barony of Coubine, as mentioned in Mr Ritchie’s\r\ncommunication. In vol. xix. p. 622. is a notice of the shifting of\r\ntwo hills of the Mavieston Range 500 yards in twenty years. In vol.\r\nxxi. p. 207. is a notice of some hundred acres in Duffus’ parish\r\ncovered three feet deep by drift sand; fourteen inches accumulating\r\nin one night. In Neill’s Tour in Orkney and Shetland 1804, it is\r\nobserved, that, in the neighbourhood of the Castle of Noltland,\r\nin Westra, much havoc has been done by the blowing of the sand.\r\nNo measures are there employed for putting a stop to this kind of\r\ndevastation. In the 6th volume of the Highland Society’s Transactions\r\nwill be found a report of the operations carried on in Harris, and\r\nalluded to in Mr Macgillivray’s communication. And in Dr Walker’s\r\nAccount of the Hebrides, and Mr Macdonald’s Work on the Hebrides,\r\nfarther details may be seen. In Jameson’s Account of the Shetland\r\nIslands, and in Shirreff and Fleming’s Reports on these islands,\r\nare also facts connected with this devastating agent. We may add,\r\nthat Dr Oudney, Major Denham, and Captain Clapperton, have added\r\nto our knowledge of the blowing sands of the African deserts. The\r\ncoloured engraving of the sand-hills of the African Desert in Denham,\r\nOudney and Clapperton’s Narrative, is a striking and interesting\r\nrepresentation of the form of the moving sand-hills of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The moving Sands of Africa and their effects are thus described in\r\nthe_ Mercure de France _for September 1809, by De Luc_.\r\n\r\nThe sands of the Lybian desert, he says, driven by the west winds,\r\nhave left no lands capable of tillage on any parts of the western\r\nbanks of the Nile not sheltered by mountains. The encroachment of\r\nthese sands on soils which were formerly inhabited and cultivated is\r\nevidently seen. M. Denon informs us, in the account of his _Travels\r\nin Lower and Upper Egypt_, that summits of the ruins of ancient\r\ncities buried under these sands still appear externally; and that,\r\nbut for a ridge of mountains called the _Lybian chain_, which borders\r\nthe left bank of the Nile, and forms, in the parts where it rises, a\r\nbarrier against the invasion of these sands, the shores of the river,\r\non that side, would long since have ceased to be habitable. Nothing\r\ncan be more melancholy, says this traveller, than to walk over\r\nvillages swallowed up by the sand of the desert, to trample under\r\nfoot their roofs, to strike against the summits of their minarets,\r\nto reflect that yonder were cultivated fields, that there grew trees,\r\nthat here were even the dwellings of men, and that all has vanished.\r\n\r\nIf, then, our continents were as ancient as has been pretended, no\r\ntraces of the habitation of men would appear on any part of the\r\nwestern bank of the Nile, which is exposed to this scourge of the\r\nsands of the desert. The existence, therefore, of such monuments\r\nattests the successive progress of the encroachments of the sand;\r\nand those parts of the bank, formerly inhabited, will for ever\r\nremain arid and waste. Thus the great population of Egypt, announced\r\nby the vast and numerous ruins of its cities, was in great part\r\ndue to a cause of fertility which no longer exists, and to which\r\nsufficient attention has not been given. The sands of the desert\r\nwere formerly remote from Egypt; the _Oases_, or habitable spots,\r\nstill appearing in the midst of the sands, being the remains of the\r\nsoils formerly extending the whole way to the Nile; but these sands,\r\ntransported hither by the western winds, have overwhelmed and buried\r\nthis extensive tract, and doomed to sterility a land which was once\r\nremarkable for its fruitfulness.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not solely to her revolutions and changes of\r\nsovereigns that Egypt owes the loss of her ancient splendour; it is\r\nalso to her having been thus irrecoverably deprived of a tract of\r\nland, by which, before the sands of the desert had covered it, and\r\ncaused it to disappear, her wants had been abundantly supplied. Now,\r\nif we fix our attention on this fact, and reflect on the consequences\r\nwhich would have attended it if thousands, or only some hundreds, of\r\ncenturies had elapsed since our continents first existed above the\r\nlevel of the sea, does it not evidently appear that all the country\r\non the west of the Nile would have been buried under this sand before\r\nthe erection of the cities of ancient Egypt, how remote soever that\r\nperiod may be supposed; and that in a country so long afflicted with\r\nsterility, no idea would even have been formed of constructing such\r\nvast and numerous edifices? When these cities indeed were built,\r\nanother cause concurred in favouring their prosperity. The navigation\r\nof the Red Sea was not then attended with any danger on the coasts;\r\nall its ports, now nearly blocked up with _reefs of coral_, had\r\na safe and easy access; the vessels laden with merchandize and\r\nprovisions could enter them and depart without risk of being wrecked\r\non these shoals, which have risen since that time, and are still\r\nincreasing in extent.\r\n\r\nThe defects of the present government of Egypt, and the discovery of\r\nthe passage from Europe to India round the Cape of Good Hope, are\r\ntherefore not the only causes of the present state of decline of this\r\ncountry. If the sands of the desert had not invaded the bordering\r\nlands on the west, if the work of the sea polypi in the Red Sea had\r\nnot rendered dangerous the access to its coasts and to its ports, and\r\neven filled up some of the latter, the population of Egypt and the\r\nadjacent countries, together with their product, would alone have\r\nsufficed to maintain them in a state of prosperity and abundance.\r\nBut now, though the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope\r\nshould cease to exist, though the political advantages which Egypt\r\nenjoyed during the brilliant period of Thebes and Memphis should\r\nbe re-established, she could never again attain the same degree of\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\nThus the reefs of coral which had been raised in the Red Sea on the\r\neast of Egypt, and the sands of the desert which invade it on the\r\nwest, concur in attesting this truth: That our continents are not of\r\na more remote antiquity than has been assigned to them by the sacred\r\nhistorian in the book of Genesis, from the great era of the deluge.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE H, p. 30.\r\n\r\n_Action of the Sea upon Coasts._\r\n\r\nThe ocean, in its action upon the cliffs and banks situated on the\r\ncoast, breaks them down to a greater or less extent, and either\r\naccumulates the debris at their basis in the form of sea beaches\r\nof greater or less magnitude, or by currents carries it away to be\r\ndeposited upon other shores, or to give rise to sand-banks near the\r\ncoast, which, in the course of time, become united to the land, and\r\nthus secure it from the further action of the sea. These _destroying_\r\nand _forming_ effects of the waters of the ocean are to be observed\r\nall around the coasts of this island; and beautiful examples of such\r\nactions are to be seen on the coasts of Ireland, and in many of the\r\nislands that lie to the west and north of Great Britain. In a paper\r\nread before the Wernerian Natural History Society, Mr Stevenson,\r\nengineer, mentions many facts illustrative of the destroying effects\r\nof the ocean on our coasts.--Thus he informs us that the waters\r\nof the sea are wearing away the land upon both sides of the Frith\r\nof Forth, not only in exposed, but also in sheltered situations,\r\nand the solid strata, as well as the looser alluvial formations,\r\nwhich owe their origin to the destroying agency of the ocean at a\r\nformer period, are again yielding to its action. At Saint Andrew’s,\r\nthe famous castle of Cardinal Beaton, which is said originally to\r\nhave been some distance from the sea, now almost overhangs it:\r\nFrom St Andrew’s northward to Eden water and the River Tay, the\r\ncoast presents a sandy beach, and is so liable to shift, that it is\r\ndifficult to trace the change it may have undergone. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that, within this last century, the sea has made such an\r\nimpression upon the sands of Barray, on the northern side of the\r\nTay, that the light-houses at the entrance of the river, which were\r\nformerly erected at the southern extremity of Button-ness, have\r\nbeen from time to time removed about a mile and a quarter further\r\nnorthward, on account of the wasting and shifting of these sandy\r\nshores, and that the spot on which the outer light-house stood in\r\nthe 17th century, is now two or three fathoms under water, and is at\r\nleast three quarters of a mile within flood-mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE, p. 32.\r\n\r\n_On the growth of Coral Islands._\r\n\r\nOf all the genera of lithophytes, the madrepore is the most abundant.\r\nIt occurs most frequently in tropical countries, and decreases\r\nin number and variety as we approach the poles. It encircles in\r\nprodigious rocks and vast reefs many of the basaltic and other\r\nrocky islands in the South Sea and Indian Ocean, and, by its daily\r\ngrowth, adds to their magnitude. The coasts of the islands in\r\nthe West Indies, also those of the islands on the east coast of\r\nAfrica, and the shores and shoals of the Red Sea, are encircled\r\nand incrusted with rocks of coral. Several different tribes of\r\nmadrepore contribute to form these coral reefs; but by far the most\r\nabundant are those of the genera carophylla, astrea and meandrina.\r\nThese lithophytic animals not only add to the magnitude of land\r\nalready existing, but, according to some naturalists, they form whole\r\nislands. Dr Forster, in his Observations made during a Voyage round\r\nthe World, gives an account of the formation of these coral islands\r\nin the South Sea.\r\n\r\nAll the low isles, he says, seem to me to be a production of the\r\nsea, or rather its inhabitants, the polype-like animals forming the\r\nlithophytes. These animalcules raise their habitation gradually\r\nfrom a small base, always spreading more and more, in proportion as\r\nthe structure grows higher. The materials are a kind of lime mixed\r\nwith some animal substances. I have seen these large structures in\r\nall stages, and of various extent. Near Turtle Island, we found, at\r\na few miles distance, and to leeward of it, a considerable large\r\ncircular reef, over which the sea broke every where, and no part of\r\nit was above water; it included a large deep lagoon. To the east\r\nand north-east of the Society Isles, are a great many isles, which\r\nin some parts are above water; in others, the elevated parts are\r\nconnected by reefs, some of which are dry at low water, and others\r\nare constantly under water. The elevated parts consist of a soil\r\nformed by a sand of shells and coral rocks, mixed with a light black\r\nmould, produced from putrified vegetables, and the dung of sea-fowls;\r\nand are commonly covered by cocoa-nut trees and other shrubs, and\r\na few antiscorbutic plants. The lower parts have only a few shrubs\r\nand the above plants; others still lower, are washed by the sea at\r\nhigh-water. All these isles are connected, and include a lagoon in\r\nthe middle, which is full of the finest fish; and sometimes there is\r\nan opening, admitting a boat or canoe, in the reef, but I never saw\r\nor heard of an opening that would admit a ship.\r\n\r\nThe reef, or the first origin of these isles, is formed by the\r\nanimalcules inhabiting the lithophytes. They raise their habitation\r\nwithin a little of the surface of the sea, which gradually throws\r\nshells, weeds, sand, small bits of corals, and other things, on the\r\ntops of these coral rocks, and at last fairly raises them above\r\nwater; where the above things continue to be accumulated by the sea,\r\ntill by a bird, or by the sea, a few seeds of plants that commonly\r\ngrow on the sea-shore, are thrown up, and begin to vegetate; and\r\nby their annual decay and reproduction from seeds, create a little\r\nmould, yearly accumulated by the mixture with sand, increasing the\r\ndry spot on every side; till another sea happens to carry a cocoa-nut\r\nhither, which preserves its vegetative power a long time in the sea,\r\nand therefore will soon begin to grow on this soil; especially as\r\nit thrives equally in all kinds of soil; and thus may all these low\r\nisles have become covered with the finest cocoa-nut trees.\r\n\r\nThe animalcules forming these reefs want to shelter their habitation\r\nfrom the impetuosity of the winds, and the power and rage of the\r\nocean; but as, within the tropics, the winds blow commonly from one\r\nquarter, they, by instinct, endeavour to stretch only a ledge, within\r\nwhich is a lagoon, which is certainly entirely screened against the\r\npower of both. This, therefore, might account for the method employed\r\nby the animalcules in building only narrow ledges of coral rocks, to\r\nsecure in their middle a calm and sheltered place; and this seems to\r\nme to be the most probable cause of the origin of all the Tropical\r\nLow Isles, over the whole South Sea.\r\n\r\nThat excellent navigator, the late Captain Flinders, gives the\r\nfollowing interesting account of the formation of Coral Islands,\r\nparticularly of Half-way Island on the north coast of Terra\r\nAustralis[381].\r\n\r\n  “This little island, or rather the surrounding reef, which is three\r\n  or four miles long, affords shelter from the south-east winds;\r\n  and being at a moderate day’s run from Murray’s Isles, it forms\r\n  a convenient anchorage for the night to a ship passing through\r\n  Torres’ Strait: I named it _Half-way Island_. It is scarcely more\r\n  than a mile in circumference, but appears to be increasing both in\r\n  elevation and extent. At no very distant period of time, it was one\r\n  of those banks produced by the washing up of sand and broken coral,\r\n  of which most reefs afford instances, and those of Torres’ Strait a\r\n  great many. These banks are in different stages of progress: some,\r\n  like this, are become islands, but not yet habitable; some are\r\n  above high-water mark, but destitute of vegetation; whilst others\r\n  are overflowed with every returning tide.\r\n\r\n  “It seems to me, that, when the animalcules which form the corals\r\n  at the bottom of the ocean cease to live, their structures adhere\r\n  to each other, by virtue either of the glutinous remains within, or\r\n  of some property in salt water; and the interstices being gradually\r\n  filled up with sand and broken pieces of coral washed by the sea,\r\n  which also adhere, a mass of rock is at length formed. Future races\r\n  of these animalcules erect their habitations upon the rising bank,\r\n  and die in their turn, to increase, but principally to elevate,\r\n  this monument of their wonderful labours. The care taken to work\r\n  perpendicularly in the early stages, would mark a surprising\r\n  instinct in these diminutive creatures. Their wall of coral,\r\n  for the most part, in situations where the winds are constant,\r\n  being arrived at the surface, affords a shelter, to leeward of\r\n  which their infant colonies may be safely sent forth; and to\r\n  this, their instinctive foresight, it seems to be owing, that the\r\n  windward side of a reef exposed to the open sea, is generally,\r\n  if not always, the highest part, and rises almost perpendicular,\r\n  sometimes from the depth of 200, and perhaps many more fathoms. To\r\n  be constantly covered with water, seems necessary to the existence\r\n  of the animalcules, for they do not work, except in holes upon the\r\n  reef, beyond low-water mark; but the coral, sand, and other broken\r\n  remnants thrown up by the sea, adhere to the rock, and form a solid\r\n  mass with it, as high as the common tides reach. That elevation\r\n  surpassed, the future remnants, being rarely covered, lose their\r\n  adhesive property; and remaining in a loose state, form what is\r\n  usually called a _key_, upon the top of the reef. The new bank is\r\n  not long in being visited by sea-birds: salt plants take root upon\r\n  it, and a soil begins to be formed; a cocoa-nut, or the drupe of\r\n  a pandanus, is thrown on shore; land birds visit it, and deposit\r\n  the seeds of shrubs and trees; every high tide, and still more\r\n  every gale, adds something to the bank; the form of an island is\r\n  gradually assumed; and last of all comes man to take possession.\r\n\r\n  “Half-way Island is well advanced in the above progressive state;\r\n  having been many years, probably some ages, above the reach of\r\n  the highest spring tides, or the wash of the surf in the heaviest\r\n  gales. I distinguished, however, in the rock which forms its basis,\r\n  the sand, coral, and shells, formerly thrown up, in a more or less\r\n  perfect state of cohesion. Small pieces of wood, pumice stone, and\r\n  other extraneous bodies which chance had mixed with the calcareous\r\n  substances when the cohesion began, were inclosed in the rock; and\r\n  in some cases were still separable from it without much force. The\r\n  upper part of the island is a mixture of the same substances in\r\n  a loose state, with a little vegetable soil; and is covered with\r\n  the _casuarina_ and a variety of other trees and shrubs, which\r\n  give food to parroquets, pigeons, and some other birds; to whose\r\n  ancestors, it is probable, the island was originally indebted for\r\n  this vegetation.”\r\n\r\nMr Chamisso, who accompanied Kotzebue in his voyage, has published\r\ninteresting observations on this subject. He informs us that the\r\nlow islands of the South Sea and Indian Ocean owe their origin\r\nprincipally to the operations of several species of coral. Their\r\nsituation with respect to each other, as they often form rows, their\r\nunion in several places in large groups, and their total absence in\r\nother parts of the same seas, induce us to conclude, that the corals\r\nhave founded their building on shoals of the sea; or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, on the tops of mountains lying under water. On the one\r\nside, as they increase, they continue to approach the surface of\r\nthe sea, on the other side they enlarge the extent of their earth.\r\nThe larger species of corals, which form blocks, measuring several\r\nfathoms in thickness, seem to prefer the more violent surf on the\r\nexternal edge of the reef; this, and the obstacles opposed to the\r\ncontinuation of their life, in the middle of a broad reef, by the\r\namassing of the shells abandoned by the animals, and fragments of\r\ncorals, are probably the reason that the outer edge of the reef first\r\napproaches the surface. As soon as it has reached such a height, that\r\nit remains almost dry at low water, the corals leave off building\r\nhigher; sea-shells, fragments of coral, shells of echini, and their\r\nbroken-off prickles, are united by the burning sun, through the\r\nmedium of the cementing calcareous sand, which has arisen from\r\nthe pulverization of the above mentioned shells into one whole or\r\nsolid stone, which, strengthened by the continual throwing up of new\r\nmaterials, gradually increases in thickness till it at last becomes\r\nso high, that it is covered only during some seasons of the year by\r\nthe high tides. The heat of the sun so penetrates the mass of stone\r\nwhen it is dry, that it splits in many places, and breaks off in\r\nflakes. These flakes, so separated, are raised one upon another by\r\nthe waves at the time of high water. The always active surf throws\r\nblocks of coral, (frequently of a fathom in length, and three or\r\nfour feet thick,) and shells of marine animals, between and upon the\r\nfoundation stones; after this the calcareous sand lies undisturbed,\r\nand offers to the seeds of trees and plants, cast upon it by the\r\nwaves, a soil upon which they rapidly grow, to overshadow its\r\ndazzling white surface. Entire trunks of trees, which are carried by\r\nthe rivers from other countries and islands, find here, at length, a\r\nresting place after their long wanderings; with them come some small\r\nanimals, such as lizards and insects, as the first inhabitants. Even\r\nbefore the trees form a wood, the real sea-birds nestle here; strayed\r\nland-birds take refuge in the bushes; and at a much later period,\r\nwhen the work has been long since completed, man also appears, builds\r\nhis hut on the fruitful soil formed by the corruption of the leaves\r\nof the trees, and calls himself lord and proprietor of this new\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding account, we have seen how the exterior edge of a\r\nsubmarine coral edifice first approaches the surface of the water,\r\nand how this reef gradually assumes the properties of land; the\r\nisland, therefore, necessarily has a circular form, and in the\r\nmiddle of it an inclosed lake. This lake, however, is not entirely\r\ninclosed; (and it could not be, for without supply from the sea it\r\nwould soon be dried up by the rays of the sun,) but the exterior\r\nwall consists of a great number of smaller islands, which are\r\nseparated from each other by sometimes larger, sometimes smaller\r\nspaces. The number of these islets amounts, in the larger coral\r\nislands, to sixty; and between them it is not so deep but that it\r\nbecomes dry at the time of ebb. The interior sea has in the middle\r\ngenerally a depth of from thirty to five-and-thirty fathoms; but on\r\nall sides towards the land the depth gradually increases. In those\r\nseas where the constant monsoons prevail, where, consequently, the\r\nwaves beat only on one side of the reef or island, it is natural\r\nthat this side of the reef, exposed to the unremitting fury of the\r\nocean, should be formed chiefly by broken-off blocks of coral, and\r\nfragments of shells, and first rise above the elements that created\r\nit. It is only these islands respecting the formation and nature\r\nof which we hitherto know any thing with certainty; we are almost\r\nentirely without any observations on those in the Indian and Chinese\r\nSea, which lie in the regions of the six months’ monsoons. From the\r\ncharts given of them, it is to be inferred that every side is equally\r\nadvanced in formation. The lee side of such a coral reef in the\r\nPacific Ocean, which is governed by the constant monsoons, frequently\r\ndoes not shew itself above the water, when the opposite side, from\r\ntime immemorial, has attained perfection in the atmospheric region;\r\nthe former reef is even interrupted in many places by intervals\r\ntolerably broad, and of the same depth as the inner sea, which have\r\nbeen left by nature, like open gates, for the exploring mariner\r\nto enter the internal calm and secure harbour. In their external\r\nform the coral islands do not resemble each other; but this, and\r\nthe extent of each, probably depends on the size of the submarine\r\nmountain tops, on which their basis is founded. Those islands which\r\nhave more length than breadth, and are opposed in their greatest\r\nextent to the winds and waves, are richer in fruitful islets than\r\nthose whose situation is not so adapted to a quick formation.\r\nIn the large island-chains, there are always some single islets\r\nwhich have the appearance of high land; these lie upon an angle\r\nprojecting into the sea, are exposed to the surf upon two sides,\r\nconsist therefore almost entirely of large blocks of coral, and are\r\ndestitute of smaller fragments of shells and coral sand to fill up\r\nthe intervals. They are, therefore, not adapted to support plants\r\nrequiring a depth of soil, and only afford a basis to high trees,\r\nprovided with fibrous roots, (as the Pisonia, Cordia Sebastiana, L.;\r\nMorinda citrifolia, L.; and Pandanus odoratissimus, L.), which, at\r\na distance, give to these, always very small islands, the form of a\r\nhill. The inner shores of the island, exposed to the surf, consist\r\nof fine sand, which is washed up by the tide. Between the small\r\nislands under their protection, and even in the middle of the inner\r\nsea, are found smaller pieces of coral, which seek a quiet abode,\r\nform in time, though very slowly, banks, till they at last reach the\r\nsurface of the water; gradually increase in extent; unite with the\r\nislands that surround them; and at length fill up the minor seas,\r\nso that what was at first a ring of islands, becomes one connected\r\nland. The islands which are so far formed, retain in the middle a\r\nflat plain, which is always lower than the wall that surrounds them\r\non the banks; for which reason pools of water are formed in them,\r\nafter a continued rain,--the only springs and wells they possess. One\r\nof the peculiarities of these islands is, that no dew falls in the\r\nevening, that they cause no tempests, and do not check the course of\r\nthe wind. The very low situation of the country sometimes exposes the\r\ninhabitants to great danger, and threatens their lives when the waves\r\nroll over their islands, if it happens that the equinox and full\r\nmoon fall on the same day (consequently when the water has reached\r\nits greatest height), and a storm agitates the sea at the same time.\r\nThese islands are said to be also shaken by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nMM. Quoy and Gaimard, in a lately published memoir, propose, _1st_,\r\nTo examine how corals raise their habitations upon rocks, and what\r\ncircumstances are favourable or unfavourable to their growth. _2d_,\r\nTo shew that there are no islands of any extent, constantly inhabited\r\nby man, which are entirely formed of corals; and that far from\r\nraising from the depths of the ocean perpendicular walls, as has been\r\nalleged, these animals form only layers or crusts of a few fathoms\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe following, according to the French naturalists, is the manner in\r\nwhich this addition or superposition of madrepores is effected. In\r\nthe places where the heat is constantly intense, where the land is\r\nindented by bays containing shallow and quiet water, which is not\r\nliable to be agitated by great surges, or by the regular breezes\r\nof the tropics, there also the saxigenous polypi multiply. They\r\nconstruct their habitations on the submarine rocks, envelope these\r\nrocks in whole or in part, but do not form them properly speaking.\r\nThus, all those reefs, those girdles of madrepore, which are so\r\nfrequently met with in the South Sea, to the leeward of islands,\r\nare shoals depending upon the conformation of the original ground,\r\nwhich will be perceived to belong to it when the direction of the\r\nmountains and hills has been attentively observed. It is always where\r\nthe slopes are gentle, and the sea shallowest, that the greatest\r\nmasses of madrepores are found. They sprout up if it is calm; in the\r\ncontrary case, they form only scattered tufts, belonging to species\r\nwhich seem to be least affected by the agitation of the waters.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and it is even a matter of general belief among\r\nmariners, say MM. Quoy and Gaimard, that there occur in the\r\nequatorial seas shoals composed of _corals_, which rise from the\r\ngreatest depths, like walls at the bottom of which the sounding\r\nline finds no ground. The fact certainly does exist in so far as\r\nregards the depth spoken of; and it is this very circumstance which\r\nis productive of so much danger to vessels, which, when taken in a\r\ncalm and carried away by currents, cannot cast anchor in such places.\r\nBut it is not correct to say that these reefs are entirety formed of\r\nmadrepores. First, because the species which always form the most\r\nconsiderable banks, such as some meandrinæ, certain caryophylleæ, but\r\nespecially the astreæ, adorned with the most beautiful and velvety\r\ncolours, require the influence of light to perfect them; because\r\nthey are not seen to grow beyond a few yards of depth; and because\r\nthey cannot consequently be developed at a depth of ten or twelve\r\nhundred feet, as they would necessarily be, did they raise the cliffs\r\nin question. Besides, these different species of animals would then\r\nalmost exclusively enjoy the privilege of living at all depths,\r\nunder all degrees of pressure, and, so to speak, in all temperatures.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance to which navigators have not adverted, which\r\ncorroborates the opinion here stated, is, that, in depths so great\r\nas those to which we allude, the sea, always agitated at the\r\nsurface, breaks with force upon these reefs, without requiring for\r\nthat purpose any additional impulse from the winds. And by merely\r\nattending to the necessary consequences of the observations of these\r\nsame navigators, who say (what is very true) that, wherever the waves\r\nare agitated, the lithophytes are unable to go on with their work,\r\nbecause they destroy their frail edifices, we shall acquire the moral\r\ncertainty that these submarine steeps are not produced by these\r\nanimalcules. But, in these same places, let there occur a hollow, a\r\nsheltered spot of some kind, and then they will immediately raise\r\ntheir habitations, and will contribute to diminish the little depth\r\nthat already exists there. And this is what may be seen in almost all\r\nthe places where an elevated temperature permits these animals to\r\ngrow in abundance.\r\n\r\nIn the localities where the tides are sensible, their currents alone\r\nmay sometimes form irregular canals between the madrepores, without\r\ntheir ever being encumbered with their species, from the twofold\r\ncause united, of the motion and the coldness of the water; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the flexible alcyonia are seen to multiply there.\r\n\r\nWhen these geological dispositions are carefully observed, we see\r\nthat the zoophytes rise to the surface of the waves, never beyond\r\nit; after which the generation which has attained thus far appears\r\nto die. It is destroyed much sooner, if, from the effect of the\r\ntides, these frail animalcules are exposed naked to the action of a\r\nburning sun. When there occur small hollows in these heaps of inert\r\nspoils, deprived of their inhabitants, which are always covered by\r\nthe water, several tufts of those lithophytes are still remarked,\r\nwhich, having escaped from the almost general destruction, glow with\r\nthe most lively colours. Then, the families which are developed anew,\r\nnot being able to build on the outside of those reefs on which the\r\nsea is constantly breaking, draw nearer and nearer the shore, where\r\nthe waves now deadened have scarcely any more action upon them, as in\r\nthe Isle of France, at Timor, the Papua, the Marian, and the Sandwich\r\nIslands; provided always the waters had not a great depth, as is\r\nthe case at Turtle Island, of which Cook speaks, where no bottom is\r\nfound between the madrepore reefs and the island, notwithstanding the\r\nshortness of the space which exists between these two points.\r\n\r\nIf we examine these animals in the places best adapted to their\r\ngrowth, we shall see their different species, the forms of which, as\r\nvaried as they are elegant, become rounded into balls, spread out\r\ninto fans, or ramify into trees, mingling together, blending with\r\neach other, and reflecting the varied hues of red, yellow, blue and\r\nviolet.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that all these alleged walls, exclusively formed of\r\ncorals, are intersected with openings through which the sea enters\r\nand retires with violence; and every body knows the danger which\r\nCaptain Cook ran on one occasion, on the coast of New Holland, when\r\nhe had no other resource, in order to save himself from destruction,\r\nthan to take the sudden resolution of attempting one of these narrow\r\npasses, where one is always sure of finding plenty of water. And this\r\ncircumstance also comes in support of what we have advanced; for, if\r\nthese perpendicular walls were entirely composed of madrepores, they\r\nwould present no deep openings in their continuity, because it is the\r\nproperty of zoophytes to build in masses that have no interruption;\r\nand because, again, could they raise themselves from very great\r\ndepths, they would end with encumbering and shutting up these\r\npassages; a circumstance which does not take place, and probably\r\nnever will, from the causes which we have related.\r\n\r\nIf these facts prove, that madrepores cannot exist at very great\r\ndepths, the submarine rocks, which they only increase in height, are\r\nnot, therefore, exclusively formed by them.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second part of the argument; and we assert, that\r\nthere are no islands of any magnitude and constantly inhabited by\r\nman, that are formed by corals; and that the layers which they\r\nconstruct under the water, are not more than a few fathoms in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nWe shall commence with the second part of this question. The\r\nimpossibility of penetrating to the bottom of the sea to examine\r\nat what precise depth the solid zoophytes establish themselves,\r\nconstrains us to confine ourselves to what has taken place in former\r\ntimes; and the monuments which the ancient revolutions of the globe\r\nhave disclosed to our view, will serve to prove what is going on in\r\nour own days. We shall mention what has been seen in several places,\r\nand we shall first speak of the island which Peron took for the\r\ntheatre of the great works of these polypi, namely the island of\r\nTimor.\r\n\r\nThe banks of coral which the sea has left exposed in the land,\r\nas it retired, are remarkable for their uncommon magnitude. The\r\nwhole shores of Coupang are formed of them, and the low hills in\r\nits vicinity are enveloped in them; but a few hundred yards from\r\nthe town, they disappear, when distinct strata of slate make their\r\nappearance. The corals form a bed over the subjacent rocks from 25 to\r\n80 feet thick.\r\n\r\nEvery thing announces that, in the Island of Timor, there exist\r\nno mountains exclusively formed of corals. As in all extensive\r\ncountries, they are composed of various substances. Quoy and Gaimard\r\nhaving coasted it for about fifty leagues, sufficiently near to\r\nenable them to form an idea of its geography, were able to see that\r\nit exhibited volcanic appearances in several parts. Besides it\r\nabounds in mines of gold and copper, which, in conjunction with what\r\nwe have already mentioned, shews in a general way the nature of the\r\nrocks of which it is composed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, remarks Quoy and Gaimard, the Bald-Head, a mountain of\r\nKing George’s harbour in New Holland, which Vancouver has described\r\nin passing, and on the summit of which he saw perfectly preserved\r\nbranches of coral, might be adduced as a fact in opposition to the\r\nopinion here advanced. Yet the phenomenon exhibited there, is still\r\nprecisely the same as at Timor, and in a thousand other places[382].\r\nThe zoophytes have built upon a basis previously existing, and\r\nthey occupy only the surface of it. For why should this Bald-Head\r\ndiffer from Mount Gardner, which, although close by it, is formed of\r\nprimitive rocks? Besides, Peron says, that it has the same geological\r\nconstitution. (T. ii. p. 133.)\r\n\r\nAt Rota, one of the Marian Isles, M. Gaudichaud, detached from the\r\nlimestone rock, at about a hundred toises above the level of the\r\nsea, branches of true madrepores, in perfect preservation. Here are,\r\nthen, three localities in which they are found at great heights. We\r\nhave observed them, say the French naturalists, at infinitely lower\r\nelevations in several other places, as at the Isle of France, where\r\nthey form a bed more than six feet thick, between two streams of\r\nlava; at Wahou, one of the Sandwich Islands, where they have not\r\na greater elevation, but extend for several hundred toises over\r\nthe surface of the island. In all these cases, it is necessary to\r\ndistinguish between the lithophytes, which have, by their living\r\npowers, formed continuous masses, from those which, after having been\r\nrolled about, broken down by the water, and mixed with sea shells,\r\ncontribute to form those deposits known by the name of _madrepore\r\nlimestone_. The latter sort is nothing but the debris of the former.\r\nDeposits of this description occur in the Marian Isles, and in those\r\nof the Papous; they occur also on the coasts of France, and in\r\nseveral other places.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from observations made in Timor and other places,\r\nthat the species of the genus Astræa which are the only ones capable\r\nof covering immense extents of surface, do not commence their\r\noperations at a greater depth than twenty-five or thirty feet, in\r\norder to raise their habitations to near the surface of the sea.\r\nFragments of these species are never obtained, either with the\r\nsounding line, or upon the anchors; nor do we ever see them, unless\r\nin places where the water is shallow; while the branched madrepores,\r\nwhich do not form thick and continuous beds, either on the elevated\r\nplaces which the ocean has left, or on the shores where they still\r\nexist, live at considerable depths.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that these corals have erected their fabrics\r\non the summits of submarine hills and mountains; and that all those\r\nreefs of Taiti, the Dangerous Archipelago, Navigators’ Islands, the\r\nFriendly Islands, &c. are composed of madrepores only at the surface.\r\n\r\nWe thus consider it demonstrated, that the rocks of the solid\r\nzoophytes or coral, are not capable of forming the immense bases on\r\nwhich the greater number of the islands that occur in the Pacific\r\nOcean rest.\r\n\r\nThere now remains for us to state how these animals, by their\r\nunion, are capable of raising small islets. Forster, as already\r\nstated, has given a very good description of the manner in which\r\nthis is effected. In fact, when these animalcules have raised their\r\nhabitations to the surface of the water, under the shelter of the\r\nland, and they remain uncovered during the reflux of the tide, the\r\nhurricanes which sometimes supervene, by the agitation which they\r\nproduce in those shallow waters, throw up from the bottom sand and\r\nmud. These substances are detained in the sinuosities and cavities\r\nformed between the corals, and thus serve to fix them together, and\r\nconnect them into masses. Whenever the summit of this new island\r\ncan remain constantly uncovered by the sea, and the waves can no\r\nlonger destroy what they themselves have contributed to form, then\r\nits extent is enlarged, and its edges are gradually raised by the\r\nsuccessive addition of sand. According to the direction of the\r\nwinds and currents they may long remain sterile; but if the seeds\r\nof vegetables be transported to them from the neighbouring shores,\r\nby the action of these two causes, then, in latitudes favourable to\r\ntheir development, we presently see these islands becoming covered\r\nwith verdure, the successively accumulated remains of which form\r\nlayers of soil, which contribute to the elevation of the surface.\r\n\r\nBut, in order that this phenomenon of growth be accomplished,\r\nthe distance from land must not be too great, because then the\r\nvegetables cannot get so easily to the islets in question, which\r\nthen remain almost always bare and sterile. And for this reason what\r\nnavigators report of those madrepore Islands of the Great Ocean,\r\nwhich are covered with verdure, and are yet at a great distance\r\nfrom any known land, has always appeared to us extraordinary; and\r\nthat so much the more, that, in those vast spaces, the violence\r\nof the waves, which nothing can break there, must disturb the\r\noperations of the zoophytes. We do not, however, deny the existence\r\nof these islands, which it would be interesting carefully to examine\r\nanew; for, whenever navigators meet with low islands between the\r\nTropics, they do not hesitate, in compliance with the generally\r\nreceived opinion, to say that they consist of madrepores. Yet how\r\nmany islands, which scarcely rise above the surface of the water,\r\nrecognise no such origin? We may mention, as an example, the Island\r\nof Boni, situated under the equator, the beautiful vegetation of\r\nwhich rises upon limestone. Cocoa Island, near Guam, is in the same\r\ncondition, being also composed of limestone. In general, if they are\r\ninhabited, consequently they have springs or lakes of fresh water,\r\nwe may almost be certain that they are not composed of lithophytes,\r\nor are only so in part, because springs could not be formed in their\r\nporous substances. Some of the Caroline Isles are excessively low; we\r\nsupposed them encrusted with madrepores; and as they have inhabitants\r\nthere must be somewhere in them a soil favourable to the accumulation\r\nof fresh water[383].\r\n\r\nIn restraining the power of these animalcules, concludes Quoy and\r\nGaimard, and in pointing out the limits which nature has prescribed\r\nthem, we have no other object than to furnish more correct data to\r\nthe naturalists who aspire to great hypothetical considerations,\r\nregarding the conformation of the globe. On reconsidering these\r\nzoophytes with greater attention, they will no longer be seen\r\nfilling up the basins of the seas, raising islands, increasing\r\nthe size of the continents, threatening future generations with a\r\nsolid equatorial circle formed of their spoils. Their influence,\r\nwith regard to the road-steads or harbours, in which they multiply,\r\nis already great enough, without adding more to it. But, compared\r\nwith the masses on which they rest, what are their layers, often\r\ninterrupted, and which must be searched for with care, before they\r\ncan be recognised, to the enormous volcanic peaks of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, the Island of Bourbon, the Moluccas, the Marian Islands, the\r\nmountains of Timor, New Guinea, &c. &c.? Nothing, certainly; and the\r\nsolid zoophytes are in no degree capable of being compared with the\r\ntestaceous mollusca, with reference to the materials which they have\r\nfurnished, and still continue to furnish to the crust of the Globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I, p. 33.\r\n\r\nON THE LEVEL OF THE BALTIC.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the last century, a controversy took place\r\namong the natural philosophers of the north of Europe, regarding\r\nthe alleged gradual lowering of the level of the sea in general,\r\nand of the Baltic Sea in particular. Celsius was the first who\r\nintroduced this idea to notice. He generalised it by applying it\r\nto all the planets, and was supported by the authority of the\r\ncelebrated Linnæus. He soon perceived, however, that the point could\r\nnever be settled by mere discussion, and that facts alone could\r\nlead to any certain result. Observation was therefore had recourse\r\nto; and thus the dispute in question had at least one good effect,\r\nthat of directing to the subject the attention of men of science,\r\nwhose situation might enable them to mark the variations of level\r\nthat take place along the coasts of the North Sea. The results of\r\ninvestigations undertaken for this purpose, are now beginning to be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nIn the course of 1820 and 1821, Mr Bruncrona, assisted by the\r\nofficers of the Pilotage Establishment, and other qualified persons,\r\nundertook the examination of all the authentic measures that had been\r\nestablished upon the west coast of the Baltic, during the last half\r\ncentury. The results of this examination are given in a short memoir,\r\ninserted in the Swedish Transactions for 1823. The following table\r\nindicates the degree to which the level of the sea has fallen during\r\nthe last forty years, on the coast of Sweden, at various latitudes.\r\nIt is proper to remark, that, in some of the places observed, the\r\nmeasures were much older, and in some others much more recent,\r\nthan the period of forty years. In both these cases, the change of\r\nlevel that must have been effected during this period, has been\r\nestimated, by calculating the mean annual depression furnished by the\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+\r\n  |           | Fall of  |           | Fall of  |           | Fall of  |\r\n  |           | surface  |           | surface  |           | surface  |\r\n  | Latitude. | in forty | Latitude. | in forty | Latitude. | in forty |\r\n  |           |  years.  |           |  years.  |           |  years.  |\r\n  +-----------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+\r\n  |East Coast.|   Feet.  |East Coast.|   Feet.  |East Coast.|   Feet.  |\r\n  |  63° 59′  |   1.50   |  59° 17′  |   2.17   |  56° 10′  |   0.00   |\r\n  |  ... ...  |   2.50   |  58  44   |   1.00   |  56  11   |   0.00   |\r\n  |  ... ...  |   0.50   |  58  42   |   1.08   |  55  53   |   0.00   |\r\n  |  61  43   |   2.50   |  58  45   |   1.17   |                      |\r\n  |  61  37   |   2.83   |  58  35   |   2.00   |   South-West Coast.  |\r\n  |  61  32   |   2.50   |  58  28   |   0.07   |  55  23   |   0.00   |\r\n  |  61  45   |   2.50   |  58  11   |   0.83   |  55  22   |   0.00   |\r\n  |  60  11   |   2.33   |  58   8   |   1.00   |  57  21   |   0.00   |\r\n  |  59  46   |   0.17   |  57  50   |   1.00   |  57  53   |   1.00   |\r\n  |  59  46   |   2.00   |  56  41   |   0.41   |                      |\r\n  +-----------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\nOf the facts collected in the course of this investigation, the\r\nfollowing may be mentioned as tending to support the opinion of a\r\nfall of level.\r\n\r\n_1st_, It is generally believed among the pilots of the Baltic,\r\nthat the sea has become shallower along the course which vessels\r\nordinarily follow; but, it is added, that this alteration is more\r\nsensible in the places where the tide collects sand, detached\r\npebbles, and sea-weeds, or in those where the bottom is composed\r\nof rocks. The same observation has been made in the neighbourhood\r\nof some large towns and fisheries; for example, a hydrographic\r\nchart made in 1771, gives six fathoms for the mean depth of the sea\r\nopposite the harbour of Landskrona, whereas, in 1817, the sounding\r\nline scarcely gave five fathoms at the same point.\r\n\r\n_2d_, According to the oldest and most experienced pilots, the\r\nstraits which separate the numerous islets scattered along the coast\r\nof Sweden, from Haarparanda to the frontiers of Norway, received\r\nvessels that drew ten feet of water; now they are not practicable for\r\nboats that draw more than two or three feet.\r\n\r\n_3d_, The pilots further affirm, that, along the whole coast of\r\nBahusia, the bottom undergoes a diminution, which becomes sensible\r\nevery ten years in certain places, where it is composed of rocks.\r\nSeveral other parts of the Baltic may be cited, in which a similar\r\nchange has been remarked.\r\n\r\nM. C. P. Hallstrom, in an Appendix to Mr Bruncrona’s Memoir, gives\r\nthe following table of the diminution observed in the depth of the\r\nwaters of the Gulf of Bothnia.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+------+------+------+----+------------------+\r\n  |                        | Mean marked in                             |\r\n  |                        |      | Height of the water reobserved in   |\r\n  |                        |      |      | Fall beneath the original    |\r\n  |       PLACES.          |      |      | mark in feet.                |\r\n  |                        |      |      |      | Number of years.      |\r\n  |                        |      |      |      |    | Fall of the water|\r\n  |                        |      |      |      |    | in 100 years,    |\r\n  |                        |      |      |      |    | in feet.         |\r\n  +------------------------+------+------+------+----+------------------+\r\n  |Raholem, parish of      | 1700 | 1750 | 2.05 | 50 | 4.10             |\r\n  |  Lower Kalix,          |      | 1775 | 2.49 | 75 | 4.32             |\r\n  |Stor Rebben, parish     | 1751 | 1785 | 1.70 | 34 | 5.00             |\r\n  |  of Pitea,             |      | 1796 | 1.90 | 45 | 4.22             |\r\n  |Ratan, parish           | 1749 | 1785 | 2.70 | 36 | 4.72             |\r\n  |  of Bygdea,            |      | 1795 | 2.50 | 46 | 5.43             |\r\n  |                        |      | 1819 | 2.60 | 70 | 3.47             |\r\n  |                        | 1774 | 1785 | 0.55 | 11 | 5.00             |\r\n  |                        |      | 1795 | 1.16 | 21 | 5.52             |\r\n  |                        |      | 1819 | 1.60 | 45 | 3.57             |\r\n  |                        | 1795 | 1819 | 0.65 | 24 | 2.71             |\r\n  |Rönnskat, on the        | 1755 | 1797 | 1.70 | 42 | 4.05             |\r\n  |  coast of Wasa,        |      | 1821 | 2.87 | 65 | 4.35             |\r\n  |Wargön, on the          | 1755 | 1785 | 1.45 | 30 | 4.83             |\r\n  |  coast of Wasa,        |      | 1797 | 1.69 | 42 | 4.02             |\r\n  |                        |      | 1821 | 2.87 | 65 | 4.35             |\r\n  |Lögfrundet, near Sefle, | 1731 | 1785 | 2.90 | 54 | 5.37             |\r\n  |                        |      | 1796 | 2.17 | 65 | 3.34             |\r\n  |Ulfon, in Angermanland, | 1795 | 1822 | 1.58 | 27 | 5.85             |\r\n  +------------------------+------+------+------+----+------------------+\r\n\r\nIt is not demonstrated that the numbers of the last column represent\r\nexactly the lowering of the water in a century; for it has not\r\nyet been sufficiently determined if this lowering be uniform,\r\nor if it vary at different periods, and if it depend upon some\r\nlocal circumstance,--upon the climate,--or upon the state of the\r\natmosphere. Nor is it properly established, that this lowering, which\r\nbecomes less perceptible from the north of the Baltic, until it\r\ndisappears entirely at the southern extremity, follows precisely the\r\nsame law of diminution as the latitude. It appears to be uniform in\r\nthe whole extent of the Gulf of Bothnia, and it rises about four feet\r\nand a quarter in that region; at Calmar (lat. 57° 50′) it is only\r\ntwo feet; but it is not yet known whether it decreases in a regular\r\nmanner between these two places.\r\n\r\nSome authors consider the facts related by MM. Bruncrona and\r\nHalstrom, as deciding the question in favour of those who believe in\r\na lowering of the level of the Baltic. The editor of the _Annalen der\r\nPhysik_[384] goes farther, and seems to consider it as confirming the\r\nopinion of a general lowering of the level of the sea. In support\r\nof this opinion, he adduces the traditions and observations of the\r\nnatives of Otaheite and of the Moluccas and Sunda Islands, regarding\r\nthe retreat of the sea in several parts of their coast. We are\r\ndisposed to stand neutral in this matter. The geographers who have\r\ncollected the greatest number of facts relating to the level of the\r\ninland seas, and of the ocean in its various regions, find nearly as\r\nmany in favour of a rise as in favour of a fall of level. The very\r\ndistribution of contrary indications, leads them to believe in a\r\npartial displacement of the mass of waters from one region towards\r\nanother, and even from the one side of an inland sea towards the\r\nopposite side; a displacement which might be owing to fugitive or\r\nmore or less durable causes, such as a variation of temperature in\r\nthe polar regions, the action of winds and of currents, modified by\r\nthe greater or less quantity of water in the rivers that feed the\r\ndifferent basins, upon the sides opposed to their direction.\r\n\r\nAre the facts contained in the memoir in question of a nature to\r\noverthrow this opinion? They do not appear so to us. The two series\r\nof observations which are adduced, only shew a fall upon the coasts\r\nof Sweden, properly so called, that is to say, upon the west coast\r\nof the Baltic, and the east coast of the Cattegat. Two observations\r\nonly have been made upon the coasts of Finland, toward the extremity\r\nof the Gulf of Bothnia. These facts would perfectly accord with the\r\nopinion of those who think that the currents determined from the\r\nnorth to the south of the Baltic by the numerous streams which rush\r\ninto it, push the waters toward the south shore, that of Pomerania,\r\nMecklenbourg, and Holstein; and that the waters consequently gain\r\nupon the land on this coast, as numerous historical facts attest,\r\nwhile they retire along the northern shores, those of the Gulf of\r\nBothnia. Be this as it may, the question as to the constancy of the\r\nlevel of the sea cannot be considered as decided, until a long series\r\nof observations shall have been made upon authentic and perfectly\r\nfixed measures erected upon all the shores of the different seas,\r\nand of the different regions of the ocean. Those which have been\r\npublished in the Swedish Transactions furnish important documents for\r\nthis purpose; and similar ones should be begun to be collected in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena exhibited by the waters of the Baltic engaged the\r\nattention of two rival speculators, Playfair and Deluc; and their\r\nviews are often alluded to by geologists. We shall here state them in\r\ntheir own words. Professor Playfair, in his well known and elegant\r\nwork on the Huttonian Theory of the Earth, has the following remarks:\r\n\r\n  “If we proceed further to the north, to the shores of the _Baltic_\r\n  for instance, we have undoubted evidence of a _change of level_ in\r\n  the same direction as on our own shores. The level of the sea has\r\n  been represented as lowering at so great a rate as _forty inches\r\n  in a century_. Celsius observed, that several rocks which are now\r\n  above the water, were not long ago sunken rocks, and dangerous\r\n  to navigators; and he took particular notice of one which, in\r\n  the year 1680, was on the surface of the water, and, in the\r\n  year 1731, was 20½ Swedish inches above it. From an inscription\r\n  near _Aspo_, in the lake _Melar_, which communicates with the\r\n  _Baltic_, engraved, as is supposed, about five centuries ago, the\r\n  level of the sea appears to have sunk in that time no less than\r\n  thirteen Swedish feet. All these facts, with many more which it is\r\n  unnecessary to enumerate, make the _gradual depression_, not only\r\n  of the _Baltic_, but of the whole _Northern Ocean_, a matter of\r\n  certainty.”--_Playfair’s Illustrations_, p. 445.\r\n\r\nThat indefatigable and accurate observer De Luc, has the following\r\ncommentary on the preceding passage.\r\n\r\n  “It would be unnecessary to mention even the two inconsiderable\r\n  facts above, if the _depression_ of the _level_ of the seas were\r\n  indeed a matter of certainty; for the best authenticated and the\r\n  least equivocal monuments of their change would then abound along\r\n  all their coasts. But proofs are every where found that such a\r\n  change is chimerical: they may be seen in all the vales coming\r\n  down to these seas, in which there is no perceptible impression of\r\n  the action of any waters but those of the land, and no vestige,\r\n  through their whole extent, of any permanent abode of those of the\r\n  sea; and proofs to the same effect are equally visible, along the\r\n  coasts of both these seas, in all the new lands which have been\r\n  formed on them, and which, being perfectly horizontal from the\r\n  point where their formation commenced, evidently show that the\r\n  water displaced by them has been constantly at the same level.\r\n  Hence appears the necessity of multiplying, as I have done, and\r\n  shall continue to do, for the subversion of a prejudice of such\r\n  ancient date, the examples of these peremptory proofs of its total\r\n  want of foundation. The rock mentioned by Celsius had probably been\r\n  observed by him at times when the level of the sea was different;\r\n  its known differences much exceeding the quantity here specified.\r\n  As for the inscription near Aspo, in a country abounding with lakes\r\n  as much as that which I have above described, if we are acquainted\r\n  with its terms, we should probably find it to be, like many which\r\n  I have seen in various places along the course of the Oder and the\r\n  Elbe, the monument of some extraordinary inundation of the land,\r\n  from the sudden melting of the snows in the mountains, at a time\r\n  when the water had been prevented from running off by an equally\r\n  extraordinary rise of the level of the sea; of which the effects on\r\n  low coasts may extend very far inland.\r\n\r\n  “By this conclusion, however, from these few facts, contrary to\r\n  every thing observed on the coasts of this sea, Mr Playfair thinks\r\n  himself authorised to maintain, that the gradual depression, not\r\n  only of the Baltic, but of the whole northern ocean, is a matter\r\n  of certainty; afterwards he examines merely which of these two\r\n  causes, the subsidence of the sea itself, or the elevation of the\r\n  land around it, agrees the best with the phenomena; and he decides\r\n  in favour of the latter, pointing out its accordance with the\r\n  Huttonian Theory.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE L, p. 119.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL REMAINS OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.\r\n\r\nFrom the observations of Werner and others, it appears, that the most\r\nsimple animals are those first met with in a mineralized state; that\r\nthese are succeeded by others more perfect, and which are contained\r\nin newer formations; and that the most perfect, as quadrupeds, occur\r\nonly in the newest formation. But we naturally inquire, have no\r\nremains of the human species been hitherto discovered in any of the\r\nformations? Judging from the arrangement already mentioned, we would\r\nnaturally expect to meet with remains of man in the newest of the\r\nformations. In the writings of ancient authors there are descriptions\r\nof anthropolithi. In the year 1577, Fel. Plater, Professor of\r\nAnatomy at Basle, described several fossil bones of the elephant\r\nfound at Lucerne, as those of a giant at least nineteen feet high.\r\nThe Lucernese were so perfectly satisfied with this discovery, that\r\nthey caused a painting to be made of the giant, as he must have\r\nappeared when alive, assumed two such giants as the supporters of\r\nthe city arms, and had the painting hung in their public hall. The\r\nLandvoigt Engel, not satisfied with this account of these remains,\r\nmaintained that our planet, before the creation of the present race\r\nof men, was inhabited by fallen angels, and that these bones were\r\npart of the skeletons of some of those miserable beings. Scheuchzer\r\npublished an engraving and description of a fossil human skeleton,\r\nwhich proved to be a gigantic species of salamander or proteus.\r\nSpallanzani describes a hill of fossil human bones in the island\r\nof Cerigo; but this also is an error, as has been satisfactorily\r\nshewn by Blumenbach. Lately, however, a fossil human skeleton has\r\nbeen imported into this country from Guadaloupe, by Sir Alexander\r\nCochrane. It is imbedded in a block of calcareous stone, composed of\r\nparticles of limestone and coral, and which, like the aggregations\r\nof shells found on the limestone coasts in some parts of this\r\ncountry, has acquired a great degree of hardness. It is therefore an\r\ninstance of a fossil human petrifaction in an alluvial formation. The\r\nengraving here given is copied from the Philosophical Transactions\r\nof the Royal Society of London; and the following description of the\r\nfossil remains it exhibits is that of Mr Konig, which has been drawn\r\nup with great care.\r\n\r\n  “The situation of the skeleton in the block was so superficial,\r\n  that its presence in the rock on the coast had probably been\r\n  indicated by the projection of some of the more elevated parts of\r\n  the left fore-arm.\r\n\r\n  “The operation of laying the bones open to view, and of reducing\r\n  the superfluous length of the block at its extremities, being\r\n  performed with all the care which its excessive hardness, and the\r\n  relative softness of the bones, required, the skeleton exhibited\r\n  itself in the manner represented in the annexed drawing (Pl. I.)\r\n  with which my friend Mr Alexander has been so good as to illustrate\r\n  this description.\r\n\r\n  “The skull is wanting; a circumstance which is the more to be\r\n  regretted, as this characteristic part might possibly have thrown\r\n  some light on the subject under consideration, or would, at least,\r\n  have settled the question, whether the skeleton is that of a\r\n  Carib, who used to give the frontal bone of the head a particular\r\n  shape by compression, which had the effect of depressing the upper\r\n  and protruding the lower edge of the orbits, so as to make the\r\n  direction of their opening nearly upwards, or horizontal, instead\r\n  of vertical[385].\r\n\r\n  “The vertebræ of the neck were lost with the head. The bones of\r\n  the thorax bear all the marks of considerable concussion, and are\r\n  completely dislocated. The seven true ribs of the left side, though\r\n  their heads are not in connexion with the vertebræ, are complete;\r\n  but only three of the false ribs are observable. On the right side\r\n  only fragments of these bones are seen; but the upper part of the\r\n  seven true ribs of this side are found on the left, and might at\r\n  first sight be taken for the termination of the left ribs; as may\r\n  be seen in the drawing. The right ribs must therefore have been\r\n  violently broken and carried over to the left side, where, if this\r\n  mode of viewing the subject be correct, the sternum must likewise\r\n  lie concealed below the termination of the ribs. The small bone\r\n  dependent above the upper ribs of the left side, appears to be the\r\n  right clavicle. The right os humeri is lost; of the left nothing\r\n  remains except the condyles in connexion with the fore-arm, which\r\n  is in the state of pronation; the radius of this side exists nearly\r\n  in its full length, while of the ulna the lower part only remains,\r\n  which is considerably pushed upwards. Of the two bones of the right\r\n  fore-arm, the inferior terminations are seen. Both the rows of the\r\n  bones of the wrists are lost, but the whole metacarpus of the left\r\n  hand is displayed, together with part of the bones of the fingers:\r\n  the first joint of the fore-finger rests on the upper ridge of the\r\n  os pubis; the two others, detached from their metacarpal bones, are\r\n  propelled downwards, and situated at the inner side of the femur,\r\n  and below the foramen magnum ischii of this side. Vestiges of three\r\n  of the fingers of the right hand are likewise visible, considerably\r\n  below the lower portion of the fore-arm, and close to the upper\r\n  extremity of the femur. The vertebræ may be traced along the whole\r\n  length of the column, but are in no part of it well defined. Of the\r\n  os sacrum, the superior portion only is distinct: it is disunited\r\n  from the last vertebra and the ilium, and driven upwards. The\r\n  left os ilium is nearly complete, but shattered, and one of the\r\n  fragments depressed below the level of the rest; the ossa pubis,\r\n  though well defined, are gradually lost in the mass of the stone.\r\n  On the right side, the os innominatum is completely shattered, and\r\n  the fragments are sunk: but towards the acetabulum, part of its\r\n  internal cellular structure is discernible.\r\n\r\n  “The thigh-bones, and the bones of the leg of the right side, are\r\n  in good preservation, but being considerably turned outwards, the\r\n  fibula lies buried in the stone, and is not seen. The lower part\r\n  of the femur of this side is indicated only by a bony outline,\r\n  and appears to have been distended by the compact limestone that\r\n  fills the cavities both of the bones of the leg and thigh, and to\r\n  the expansion of which, these bones probably owe their present\r\n  shattered condition. The lower end of the left thigh-bone appears\r\n  to have been broken and lost in the operation of detaching the\r\n  block; the two bones of the leg, however, on this side, are nearly\r\n  complete; the tibia was split almost the whole of its length a\r\n  little below the external edge, and the fissure being filled up\r\n  with limestone, now presents itself as a dark-coloured straight\r\n  line. The portion of the stone which contained part of the bones\r\n  of the tarsus and metatarsus, was unfortunately broken; but the\r\n  separate fragments are preserved.\r\n\r\n  “The whole of the bones, when first laid bare, had a mouldering\r\n  appearance, and the hard surrounding stone could not be detached\r\n  without frequently injuring their surface; but after an exposure\r\n  for some days to the air, they acquired a considerable degree of\r\n  hardness. Sir H. Davy, who subjected a small portion of them to\r\n  chemical analysis, found that they contained part of their animal\r\n  matter, and all their phosphate of lime.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE M, p. 128.\r\n\r\n_Account of the Displacement of that part of the Coast of the\r\nAdriatic which is occupied by the Mouths of the Po._\r\n\r\nThat portion of the shore of the Adriatic which lies between the\r\nlake, or rather _lagune_, of Commachio, and the _lagunes_ of Venice,\r\nhas undergone considerable alterations since ancient times, as is\r\nattested by authors worthy of entire credit, and as is still evinced\r\nby the actual state of the soil in the districts near the coast;\r\nbut it is impossible now to give any exact detail of the successive\r\nprogress of these changes, and more especially of their precise\r\nmeasures during the ages which preceded the twelfth century of our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, certain, that the city of _Hatria_, now called\r\n_Adria_, was formerly situated on the edge of the coast; and by this\r\nwe attain a known fixed point upon the primitive shore, whence the\r\nnearest part of the present coast, at the mouth of the Adige, is at\r\nthe distance of 25,000 _metres_[386]; and it will be seen in the\r\nsequel, that the extreme point of the alluvial promontory formed by\r\nthe Po, is farther advanced into the sea than the mouth of the Adige\r\nby nearly 10,000 metres[387].\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Adria have formed exaggerated pretensions, in\r\nmany respects, as to the high antiquity of their city, though it\r\nis undeniably one of the most ancient in Italy, as it gave name to\r\nthe sea which once washed its walls. By some researches made in\r\nits interior and its environs, a stratum of earth has been found\r\nmixed with fragments of Etruscan pottery, and with nothing whatever\r\nof Roman manufacture. Etruscan and Roman pottery are found mixed\r\ntogether in a superior bed, on the top of which the vestiges of\r\na theatre have been discovered. Both of these beds are far below\r\nthe level of the present soil. I have seen at Adria very curious\r\ncollections, in which these remains of antiquity are separately\r\nclassed; and having, some years ago, observed to the viceroy, that\r\nit would be of great importance, both to history and geology, to\r\nmake a thorough search into these buried remains at Adria, carefully\r\nnoticing the levels in comparison with the sea, both of the primitive\r\nsoil, and of the successive alluvial beds, his Highness entered\r\nwarmly into my ideas; but I know not whether these propositions have\r\nbeen since carried into effect.\r\n\r\nFollowing the coast, after leaving Hatria, which was situated at\r\nthe bottom of a small bay or gulf, we find to the south a branch of\r\nthe _Athesis_ or Adige, and of the _Fossa Philistina_, of which the\r\nremaining trace corresponds to what might have been the Mincio and\r\nTartaro united, if the Po had still run to the south of Ferrara. We\r\nnext find the _Delta Venetum_, which seems to have occupied the place\r\nwhere the lake or lagune of Commachio is now situated. This delta\r\nwas traversed by seven branches of the _Eridanus_ or Po, formerly\r\ncalled also the _Vadis Padus_ or _Podincus_; which river, at the\r\ndiramification of these seven branches, and upon its left or northern\r\nbank, had a city named _Trigoboli_, whose site could not be far from\r\nwhere Ferrara now stands. Seven lakes, inclosed within this delta,\r\nwere called _Septem Maria_, and Hatria was sometimes denominated\r\n_Urbs Septem Marium_, or the city of the seven seas or lakes.\r\n\r\nFollowing the coast from Hatria to the northwards, we come to the\r\nprincipal mouth of the _Athesis_ or Adige, formerly named _Fossa\r\nPhilistina_, and afterwards _Estuarium Altini_, an interior sea,\r\nseparated by a range of small islands from the Adriatic Gulf, in the\r\nmiddle of which was a cluster of other small isles, called _Rialtum_,\r\nand upon this archipelago the city of Venice is now seated. The\r\n_Estuarium Altini_ is what is now called the Lagune of Venice, and no\r\nlonger communicates with the sea, except by five passages, the small\r\nislands of the Archipelago having been united into a continuous dike.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the lagunes, and north from the city of Este, we find\r\nthe _Euganian_ mountains, or hills, forming, in the midst of a vast\r\nalluvial plain, a remarkable isolated group of rounded hills, near\r\nwhich spot the fable of the ancients supposes the fall of Phæton to\r\nhave taken place. Some writers have supposed that this fable may have\r\noriginated from the fall of some vast masses of inflamed matters near\r\nthe mouths of the Eridanus, that had been thrown up by a volcanic\r\nexplosion; and it is certain that abundance of volcanic products are\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of Padua and Verona.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient notices that I have been able to procure respecting\r\nthe situation of the shores of the Adriatic at the mouths of the Po,\r\nonly begin to be precise in the twelfth century. At that epoch the\r\nwhole waters of this river flowed to the south of Ferrara, in the _Po\r\nde Volano_ and the _Po di Primaro_, branches which inclosed the space\r\noccupied by the _lagune_ of Commachio. The two branches which were\r\nnext formed by an irruption of the waters of the Po to the north of\r\nFerraro, were named the river of _Corbola_, _Longola_, or _Mazzorno_,\r\nand the river _Toi_. The former, and more northern of these, received\r\nthe _Tartaro_, or _canal bianco_, near the sea, and the latter was\r\njoined at Ariano by another branch derived from the Po, called the\r\n_Goro river_. The sea-coast was evidently directed from south to\r\nnorth, at the distance of ten or eleven thousand _metres_[388] from\r\nthe meridian of Adria; and _Loreo_, to the north of _Mesola_, was\r\nonly about 2000 _metres_[389] from the coast.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the twelfth century, the flood-waters of the\r\nPo were retained on their left or northern side by dikes near the\r\nsmall city of _Ficarolo_, which is about 19,000 _metres_[390] to\r\nthe north-west of Ferrara, spreading themselves southwards over\r\nthe northern part of the territory of Ferrara and the _Polesine_\r\nof Rovigo, and flowed through the two formerly mentioned canals of\r\n_Mazzorno_ and _Toi_. It seems perfectly ascertained, that this\r\nchange in the direction of the waters of the Po had been produced by\r\nthe effects of human labours; and the historians who have recorded\r\nthis remarkable fact only differ from each other in some of the\r\nmore minute details. The tendency of the river to flow in the new\r\nchannels, which had been opened for the more ready discharge of its\r\nwaters when in flood, continually increased; owing to which the\r\ntwo ancient chief branches, the _Volano_ and _Primaro_, rapidly\r\ndecreased, and were reduced in less than a century to their present\r\ncomparatively insignificant size; while the main direction of the\r\nriver was established between the mouth of the Adige to the north,\r\nand what is now called _Porto di Goro_, on the south. The two\r\nbefore-mentioned canals of _Mazzorno_ and _Toi_ becoming insufficient\r\nfor the discharge, others were dug; and the principal mouth, called\r\n_Bocco Tramontana_, or the northern mouth, having approached the\r\nmouth of the Adige, the Venetians became alarmed in 1604; when they\r\nexcavated a new canal of discharge, named _Taglio de Porto Viro_, or\r\n_Po delle Fornaci_, by which means the _Bocco Maestra_, was diverted\r\nfrom the Adige towards the south.\r\n\r\nDuring four centuries, from the end of the twelfth to that of the\r\nsixteenth, the alluvial formations of the Po gained considerably upon\r\nthe sea. The northern mouth, which had usurped the situation of the\r\n_Mazzorno_ canal, becoming the _Rama di Trimontana_, had advanced\r\nin 1600 to the distance of 20,000 _metres_[391] from the meridian\r\nof Adria; and the southern mouth, which had taken possession of\r\nthe canal of _Toi_, was then 17,000 _metres_[392] advanced beyond\r\nthe same point. Thus the shore had become extended nine or ten\r\nthousand _metres_[393] to the north, and six or seven thousand to\r\nthe south[394]. Between these two mouths there was formerly a bay,\r\nor a part of the coast less advanced than the rest, called _Sacca\r\ndi Goro_. During the same period of four hundred years previous to\r\nthe commencement of the seventeenth century, the great and extensive\r\nembankments of the Po were constructed; and also, during the same\r\nperiod, the southern slopes of the Alps began to be cleared and\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nThe great canal, denominated _Taglio di Porto Viro_, or _Po delle\r\nFornaci_, ascertains the advance of the alluvial depositions in the\r\nvast promontory now formed by the mouths or delta of the Po. In\r\nproportion as their entrances into the sea extend from the original\r\nland, the yearly quantity of alluvial depositions increases in an\r\nalarming degree, owing to the diminished slope of the streams, which\r\nwas a necessary consequence, of the prolongation of their bed, to the\r\nconfinement of the waters between dikes, and to the facility with\r\nwhich the increased cultivation of the ground enabled the mountain\r\ntorrents which flowed into them to carry away the soil. Owing to\r\nthese causes, the bay called _Sacra di Goro_ was very soon filled\r\nup, and the two promontories which had been formed by the two former\r\nprincipal mouths of _Mazzorno_ and _Toi_, were united into one vast\r\nprojecting cape, the most advanced point of which is now 32,000 or\r\n33,000 _metres_[395] beyond the meridian of Adria: so that in the\r\ncourse of two hundred years, the mouths or delta of the Po have\r\ngained about 14,000 _metres_[396] upon the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts, of which I have given a brief enumeration, the\r\nfollowing results are clearly established.\r\n\r\n_First_, That, at some ancient period, the precise date of which\r\ncannot be now ascertained, the waves of the Adriatic washed the walls\r\nof Adria.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, That, in the twelfth century, before a passage had been\r\nopened for the waters of the Po at _Ficarrolo_; on its left or\r\nnorthern bank, the shore had been already removed to the distance of\r\nnine or ten thousand _metres_[397] from Adria.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, That the extremities of the promontories formed by the\r\ntwo principal branches of the Po, before the excavation of the\r\n_Taglio di Porto Viro_, had extended, by the year 1600, or in four\r\nhundred years, to a medium distance of 18,500 _metres_[398] beyond\r\nAdria; giving, from the year 1200, an average yearly increase of the\r\nalluvial land of 25 _metres_[399].\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, That the extreme point of the present single promontory,\r\nformed by the alluvions of the existing branches, is advanced\r\nto between thirty-two and thirty-three thousand _metres_[400]\r\nbeyond Adria; whence the average yearly progress is about seventy\r\n_metres_[401] during the last two hundred years, being a greatly more\r\nrapid proportion than in former times.\r\n\r\n  PRONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE, p. 244.\r\n\r\n_On the Universal Deluge._\r\n\r\nMr Cuvier in the present work, and more recently in a note to Mr\r\nLemaire’s edition of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, enumerates the Mosaic,\r\nGrecian, Assyrian, Persian, Indian, and Chinese traditions,\r\nconcerning a universal deluge; and concludes from them, that the\r\nsurface of the globe, five or six thousand years ago, underwent a\r\ngeneral and sudden revolution, by which the lands inhabited by the\r\nhuman beings who lived at that time, and by the various species of\r\nanimals known at the present day, were overflowed by the ocean; out\r\nof which emerged the present habitable portions of the globe. This\r\ncelebrated naturalist maintains, that these regions of the earth\r\nwere peopled by the few individuals who were preserved, and that the\r\ntradition of the catastrophe has been preserved among these new races\r\nof people, variously modified by the difference of their situation\r\nand their social disposition. According to Mr Cuvier, similar\r\nrevolutions of nature had taken place, at periods long antecedent\r\nto that of the Mosaic deluge. The dry land was inhabited, if not by\r\nhuman beings, at least by land animals at an earlier period; and must\r\nhave been changed from the dry land to the bed of the ocean; and it\r\nmight even be concluded from the various species of animals contained\r\nin it, that this change, as well as its opposite, had occurred more\r\nthan once.\r\n\r\nThis opinion being brought forward in a geognostic work, especially\r\nin a work abounding in such valuable matters of fact, and stated\r\nas the result of geognostic investigation, we may be permitted, in\r\nthis point of view, to examine it; and to ask, whether, from the\r\nphenomena exhibited by the present condition of the earth’s surface,\r\nwe are entitled to conclude that it owes its conformation to such a\r\nuniversal deluge.\r\n\r\nWe know, from arguments suggested by chemistry and the higher\r\nmechanics, that the globe was once in a state of fluidity; hence it\r\nmight be maintained with some appearance of probability, that the\r\ncondition of the earth, previous to the existence of organic matter,\r\ndepended upon fusion; and that the primitive rocks are of igneous\r\norigin. Since, however, granite has been found above rocks of various\r\nkinds which contain the remains of organic bodies, we are under no\r\nnecessity of ascribing to primitive rocks an origin different from\r\nthat of subsequent formations; and, without having recourse to other\r\narguments, the fact, that aquatic animals are the most abundant of\r\nfossil organic remains from the earliest of the transition to the\r\nlatest of the secondary and tertiary formations, affords evidence\r\nthat they are precipitates from water.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great and daily advancement of science, our\r\nknowledge of chemistry is still too imperfect for us to arrive at\r\nan adequate knowledge of the state of this water, or rather sea,\r\nas, from its universal expansion, it must be denominated. Did it\r\ncontain dissolved in it at the same time all the materials from\r\nwhich the various beds of rock were formed; what were the solvents\r\nof those materials which we find, either insoluble in water, or\r\nat least not easily soluble; by what means were the precipitates\r\nproduced; and whence came this prodigious mass of waters? Upon these\r\nunanswered questions depend others no less important. The aquatic\r\nanimals of a former world undoubtedly lived in this sea; otherwise,\r\nwe must admit of another sea free from heterogeneous materials. But\r\ndid these animals continue to live in it during the whole process\r\nof precipitation; and did this process proceed so slowly and\r\nimperceptibly, that animal life was not interrupted by it, and that\r\nonly remains of dead animals, such as the skeletons of fishes, and\r\nthe covering of shell-fishes, were enveloped in the precipitates?\r\nOr, did animal life continue only during the state of solution; and\r\nwere the myriads of aquatic animals found in beds of rocks buried in\r\nthem alive? Many naturalists appear to entertain the latter opinion,\r\nfrom observing the agonies of death depicted in the distorted\r\nposition of fishes in copper-slate, or from deriving the bituminous\r\nproperties of stink-stone, as well as of marl, from the decomposition\r\nof animal bodies, of which such numerous vestiges are extant in these\r\nbeds? In this way a plausible explanation is given of the phenomena\r\nof a former world that has perished. How, then, do they explain the\r\nconstant appearance of so many species, which have continued without\r\ninterruption for such an infinite length of time? Have these species\r\nbeen propagated by individuals who accidentally escaped destruction:\r\nor, Does a new race continually spring up again? But laying aside\r\nthe difficulty of this explanation, the violent destruction of so\r\nmany races of animals, is scarcely consistent with the general\r\norder of the universe, according to which, we behold every animal\r\noccupying its proper element, and fulfilling its particular destiny.\r\nWe, therefore, involuntarily revert to the opinion, that those\r\ncreatures, whose remains are preserved in beds of rocks, have lived\r\ncontinually in the sea, out of which the rocks were precipitated, in\r\nthe same manner as the analogous species now living in the sea become\r\nenveloped in deposits still taking place, although on a comparatively\r\nsmall scale.\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said does not entitle us to admit that the various\r\nparts of the earth have been, from time to time, overflowed with\r\nwater. Yet are there other appearances which completely indicate\r\nsuch a change, namely, beds of coal, and the fossil remains of land\r\nanimals. The carbonisation of roots of trees in clefts of rocks,\r\nand of marsh plants in peat-bogs, which takes place, as it were,\r\nunder our own immediate observation; the transitions of bituminous\r\nwood into pitch-coal, the frequent presence of vegetables partly\r\nconverted into coal, in the neighbourhood of beds of coal, and which\r\nare more abundant the nearer they are to these beds; and, finally,\r\nthe chemical nature of coal, which is similar to that of vegetables,\r\ngo to prove the vegetable origin of the older and independent coal\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThough some fossil vegetables might derive their origin, by being\r\nfloated to quarters more or less remote from their native soil, as we\r\nfind to be the case in many islands of the South Sea, and on other\r\nshores; on the other hand, neither the breadth and extent of beds of\r\ncoal, nor the erect position in which fossil trees and reed plants\r\nare not unfrequently found in their neighbourhood, coincide with such\r\nan explanation. The plants, from which these beds were formed, once\r\nstood and grew in the place where they were buried; and, from these\r\nremains, we infer that they were entirely land plants, tree-ferns,\r\n_Lycopodia_, and other cryptogamia. It also appears undeniable, that\r\nthe land, being once dry, was, during a longer or shorter time,\r\ncovered with luxuriant vegetation; that it was afterwards overflowed\r\nwith water, and then became dry land again. But, was this overflow of\r\nwater produced by a sudden, violent, and universal catastrophe, such\r\nas we consider the deluge? Many circumstances leave room for opposite\r\nconjecture. If it is probable that the older or black coal is of\r\nvegetable origin, the plants from which it has originated, must have\r\nsuffered an incomparably greater change than those of more recent\r\ncoal formations. Their composition and their texture, afford evidence\r\nof a long operation of the fluid in which the changes were produced;\r\nand their situation, proves that the substance of the plants, though\r\nnot entirely dissolved, was yet much comminuted, and was kept\r\nfloating and swimming, and then precipitated. How can we, in any\r\nother way, account for the layers of sandstone and slate-clay, with\r\nwhich coal regularly alternates, so that from one to sixty alternate\r\nbeds have been enumerated? How can we explain the combination of\r\nmineral coal with slate-clay, or account for the appearance of\r\nbituminous shale, flinty slate, of iron-pyrites and iron-ore, in the\r\nmidst of mineral coal itself? We do not, however, admit of a repeated\r\nuncovering and covering of the land with water, and of a renewal of\r\nvegetation for every particular bed of coal; far from it, for violent\r\ninundations exhibit very different phenomena. These formations, like\r\npure mineral formations, bear the evident impress of a lengthened\r\noperation, and of gentle precipitations; and whoever still entertains\r\ndoubts regarding this, may have them completely removed by the\r\ncondition in which vegetable remains are frequently found in the\r\ncoal formations, by the perfect preservation of the most delicately\r\nshaped fern leaves, by the upright position of stems, and by other\r\nappearances of a similar character. It is also an important objection\r\nagainst the universality of the cover of water, notwithstanding the\r\nwide extent of beds of coal, that they are sometimes accompanied with\r\nfossil remains of fresh-water shells, from which we are entitled to\r\ndraw the conclusion, that they must have been deposited in inclosed\r\nbasins of inland waters.\r\n\r\nFrom the beds of coal found in various situations among _Alpine_\r\nlimestone, as well as in other secondary formations, under similar\r\ncircumstances, we are at liberty to maintain that they are not\r\nindebted for their origin to any universal and sudden revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen we proceed to the second division of coal formations, to\r\nbrown coal, or to _lignite_, the principal difference we discover\r\nis, that the change which the vegetables have undergone, having\r\ntaken place at a time when the chemical power had lost much of its\r\nenergy, was incomplete; and besides, we observe in the different\r\nbrown coal formations the same repetition of single beds alternating\r\nwith other beds of rocks, the mixture of different minerals, and\r\nnot unfrequently of upright stems. Some appear to be derived from\r\nsea plants, and others from fresh-water plants; but the greater\r\nproportion from land plants. They, equally with the beds of black\r\ncoal, give evidence of a new overflow of water, and the water plants\r\nthemselves, which never thrive at a great depth, and which frequently\r\nappear under prodigious beds of rocks, must have experienced such a\r\nchange. But that change was scarcely of the kind which we understand\r\nby a deluge, and the frequent repetition of deluges indicated,\r\naccording to some, by the repeated beds of coal from the transition\r\nto the newest tertiary periods, is hardly credible. It may be\r\nmaintained, with more certainty, of _brown coal_ than of _black\r\ncoal_, that they have been formed in land water, and hence in\r\nlimited and isolated basins of water, since fresh-water animals are\r\ntheir constant attendants.\r\n\r\nAlthough the beds of coal of our secondary formations appear to\r\nhave originated in a similar way with other mineral formations, and\r\nnot by violent catastrophes, it is otherwise with a part of those\r\nvegetable remains which are met with in alluvial land. Subterranean\r\nforests, whose circumference, in some instances, extends about 70\r\nsquare leagues, partly in a state of good preservation, and partly\r\nmore or less decomposed, afford satisfactory proof of deluges, and\r\nhave undoubtedly been covered up with earth by a violent eruption of\r\nstanding or running water. But these are local effects, similar to\r\nwhat take place in our own day, but on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nThere are abundant fossil remains of land animals, resembling those\r\nof water animals, found in such a state of preservation, that we\r\ncannot suppose them to have been brought hither from distant places,\r\nand by means of currents. Their appearing in beds of rocks, or\r\ngenerally in aqueous precipitates, proves that the soil they first\r\ninhabited, must have been dry land, afterwards overflowed with water.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of what are called fresh water shells, in alternate\r\nbeds with marine animals, being sometimes observed in newer flœtz\r\nrocks in great abundance, seems to indicate a reiterated retreat\r\nand return of the sea. But however meritorious the labours of\r\nnaturalists, through whom attention has been directed to the\r\nsubject, may be in other respects, we are nevertheless disposed\r\nto entertain doubts concerning their conclusions. In our own seas\r\nand ponds upon the coasts, we observe the same testaceous animals\r\ngrowing equally well in salt water, and in water nearly fresh; and,\r\nagain, fresh water animals living in salt water[402]. By artificial\r\nmeans the inhabitants of the sea may be changed into inhabitants of\r\nfresh water; as fresh-water animals are, in their turn, converted\r\ninto marine animals, so that, to decide concerning the proper\r\nelement of each individual species is often matter of difficulty.\r\nTherefore, other circumstances besides that of containing salt\r\nmust be taken into account. The occasional plenty, scarcity, or\r\nabsolute want of food; the soil being sometimes sandy, slimy, or\r\nrocky; the depth, extent, agitation or tranquillity of the water;\r\nand, finally, the quality of the air contained in it, may be as\r\ninstrumental in determining the habitation of these animals, as the\r\nmaterials which the water holds in solution. An excellent observer\r\nhas indeed very lately shewn in a treatise, which supports the idea\r\nof fresh-water formations, that we possess no unerring character\r\nfor distinguishing sea shell-fish from those of fresh water; but\r\nadmitted, notwithstanding the transition above stated, we can draw\r\na line of distinction between them, we must not forget that this\r\ninvestigation is neither regarding sea shell-fish now existing,\r\nnor of our present waters. We indeed draw our conclusion, and\r\nnot without reason, from similar conformation, similar modes of\r\nexistence. But one of two things must be; either that the shell-fish,\r\nwhose remains are found in beds of rocks, lived in the water out\r\nof which these beds were precipitated, or the water in which they\r\nlived, was dislodged by other water containing the materials of the\r\nprecipitations. In the first and more generally admitted case, the\r\nwater was so different from the present water, whether salt or fresh,\r\nthat we cannot infer from the inhabitants of the latter any thing\r\nconcerning the inhabitants of the former; but we can confidently\r\nmaintain, that a greater resemblance prevails between our sea and\r\nland water, than between either the one or the other, and that fluid\r\nwhich was inhabited by the shell-fish. In other respects, there\r\nremains no other difference between fresh and salt water formations,\r\nbut that the bottom upon which the former is placed once contained\r\nland water; a fact worthy of observation: but the notion of enclosed\r\nbasins, and of isolated formations originating in them, the way\r\nin which fresh water formations are supposed to have taken place,\r\nremained a long time unsatisfactory. Finally, we may be permitted to\r\nask, upon what grounds they considered themselves entitled to ascribe\r\nto the former sea the continual possession of a portion of salt,\r\nwhile the salt precipitates appear only at particular intervals, and\r\nafter long interruptions? If the sea occasionally contained a great,\r\nand sometimes a very small, quantity of salt, it might equally be at\r\ntimes altogether without it. And yet it deserves to be remembered,\r\nthat the beds of rock, to which the salt formations are most nearly\r\nrelated, contain no petrifactions; that, therefore, the so-called\r\nmarine animals are wanting in those periods during which we have any\r\ndirect evidence of the presence of salt water.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a geognostic fact, which, in preference to all\r\nothers, has been cited in evidence of violent revolutions and\r\ndeluges, that is, the appearance of conglomerates or of reproduced\r\nkinds of stone. Indeed, there might still be a wide field for\r\ninvestigation here, and more than one formation, which now passes\r\nfor sandstone, might be acknowledged as an original and chemical\r\nproduction; without having occasion to go so far as Mr Gerhard does\r\nwith greywacke,--that is, to consider them as immediate precipitates\r\nfrom the atmosphere. But still conglomerates sufficiently genuine,\r\nwill remain from the transition period through all the subsequent\r\nformations, to serve as acknowledged monuments of destruction, as\r\nwell as of the renovation of what was destroyed. These are the\r\nCodices rescripti, in the archives of the Earth, out of which, the\r\nantiquarian will one day decipher the almost obliterated traces of\r\nher former condition, as well as the history of her changes. Though\r\nthese conglomerates deviate so much in their nature, and in the\r\ncharacter of their origin, from chemical productions, they have yet\r\namong themselves this remarkable and common characteristic, that,\r\nwith few exceptions, the older are much less varied in character,\r\nand more extensive in distribution, than the newer, and that, at\r\nlength, the newest conglomerates become mere local appearances.\r\nBut, in reference to the main question which engages our attention,\r\nwe may conjecture that the beds of rocks from which the sea had\r\nnever retreated, might be assailed by its floods and currents,\r\nand shattered to pieces, as happens even in our own time, and the\r\nfragments be again reunited into solid rocks, by means of the still\r\nremaining dissolved matter in the water. But of many conglomerates it\r\nis evident that they have been deposited on the dry land, in the same\r\nway as our gravels. Jupiter, who took counsel with himself, whether\r\nhe would destroy the sinful world with fire or water, and at length\r\ndecided for water[403], may not be so justly considered the author of\r\nthese appearances, as Saturn, who devoured his children. Or, to be\r\nless metaphorical in our language, it may perhaps have been with the\r\norigin of conglomerates, as it is in our own day with the origin of\r\nfragments of rock and boulders, in which the rock being fractured in\r\nvarious places by the alternations of heat and cold, by the influence\r\nof air and atmospheric water, falls into pieces of greater or smaller\r\nmagnitude, which are carried forward by the water, and gradually\r\nrounded in their progress, so that they assume a more perfectly\r\nglobular shape the farther they are removed from their original\r\nsituation. Therefore, as regards the foregoing enquiry, it is not an\r\nunimportant circumstance, that the long but continual rolling of the\r\nboulders during their rounding, appears to be much more efficacious\r\nthan a rapid and violent impetus, and that, in this case, as in\r\nmany other geognostic appearances, time rather than force is to be\r\ntaken into account. Another circumstance, perhaps, corresponds with\r\nthis, that the change produced by the weather, not only by the first\r\ndisunion, but also by the progressive disintegration of the rocks,\r\nby the blunting of the edges and corners, by the diminution of the\r\nfragments, and generally in the origin of the boulders and fragments\r\nof rocks of every description, has just as much influence as the\r\nmechanical operation of the water; and that a great part of the land\r\ncalled Alluvial, generally owes its existence to this cause[404]. But\r\nif, upon farther consideration, the conglomerates appear to derive\r\ntheir origin in a similar way with rolled masses of gravel, they\r\nafford evidence, nevertheless, of the elevated station of the water\r\nin the neighbourhood, from which they had been before removed; for\r\ntheir conglomeration could take place only under water; and, with few\r\nexceptions, they occupy an incomparably greater elevation than any of\r\nthe coal formations, or any of the beds of rocks which enclose the\r\nremains of land animals.\r\n\r\nGeognosy certainly contains many facts, which cannot be explained,\r\nbut by a change from dry land to the bottom of the sea, although our\r\nknowledge of them is still so imperfect, that we cannot hazard a\r\nprobable conjecture respecting the numbers of these changes, whether\r\nthey commence at the same or at different periods in the various\r\nquarters of the world, and whether they are local or universal.\r\nThese changes appear neither sudden nor violent, such as we consider\r\nrevolutions of the earth, but at all times proceed with silent and\r\nregular steps, and depend upon similar causes, concealed it is true\r\nfrom us, such as the universal retreat of the waters from their\r\noriginal height to the present bed of the ocean. We do not belong to\r\nthose geologists who divert the world from its axis for the purpose\r\nof explaining the inequalities of its surface, at whose command the\r\nEarth sometimes opens her bosom to engulf the sea, and at other times\r\nthe floodgates of Heaven are lifted up to pour down another ocean.\r\nHe who reflects on the devastation caused by earthquakes, inundations\r\nand the fall of mountains, even though they are merely local\r\nappearances confined to particular quarters, cannot help putting\r\nthe question to himself, how the order, regularity and connection\r\nexhibited by strata of rocks, could in any measure exist, if the same\r\nor similar accidents had happened throughout the whole world, and\r\nif mechanical power had operated with such energy, and to such an\r\nextent? All our knowledge of the structure of the earth, and of the\r\nexistence of its inhabitants, declares rather a quiet uninterrupted\r\nand continually progressive advancement in its formation and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn the lapse of geological epochs, we observe a gradation of rock\r\nformations following one another, in which the latter, however\r\nremotely connected, still appear sufficiently similar to the earlier\r\nto indicate a common origin, till they at length terminate in simple\r\nformations, resembling those which are presently taking place. When\r\nthe precipitates were exhausted, and the structure was completed,\r\nnay, even earlier, its destruction commenced; not that violent\r\ndestruction by which lofty mountains are torn asunder and levelled,\r\nno uproar of nature, no gigantic struggle of the elements, such as\r\nwe commonly conceive, but a decomposition of the strata of rocks\r\nto a greater or less depth, caused partly by chemical, partly by\r\nmechanical, but slow operating powers, what they wanted in intensity\r\nbeing compensated by the endurance of their operation. According\r\nto the common law of nature, deficiency of power is supplied by\r\nduration of time; for, of all the oracles which have been consulted\r\nconcerning the formation of the earth, there is no one which can\r\nmake such important revelations to us as the oracle of the age of\r\nmountains. These operations at the earth’s surface generally appear\r\nto have produced its present figure, and to have designed it for the\r\nhabitation of numerous organic beings. This appears as early as a\r\nsuitable element occurred; first, in water, then in land animals;\r\nand, like the formation of rocks, we observe a regular succession of\r\norganic formations, the later always descending from the earlier,\r\ndown to the present inhabitants of the earth, and to the last created\r\nbeing who was to exercise dominion over them. But here occurs this\r\nimportant distinction: the organic world with youthful vigour renews\r\nitself daily, and decomposes its materials only to reunite them by\r\nfresh combinations in uninterrupted succession; while the powers of\r\nthe inorganic world appear almost extinguished. Though this course of\r\nnature is manifest to our own observation, her resources and progress\r\nare, on the contrary, more concealed; and we can hardly lift the veil\r\nwhich conceals her, unless we follow Bacon’s advice, Turn back from\r\nrash theories, and follow observation and experience.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto endeavoured to shew that incontrovertible geognostic\r\nfacts indicate an alternate rising and falling of the water which\r\ncovered the earth’s surface, but that they were not of a kind to\r\njustify the notion of violent revolutions, or of sudden and universal\r\neruptions of the sea; and that, therefore, such deluges as the Mosaic\r\ndeluge, recorded in the traditions of nations, were not revolutions\r\nof this description. If, according to the supposition of Cuvier, the\r\nearth’s surface inhabited at the commencement of the latter deluge\r\nhas become the present bed of the sea, and the former bed of the\r\nsea has become the present dry land, then, according to the present\r\nstate of geography, _though only conjectural_, we should be able\r\nto point out such portions of the earth as were overwhelmed by the\r\ncatastrophe; and yet we have never heard that any one has hazarded\r\nsuch an experiment. In the constitution of the present habitable\r\nglobe, we find no proofs remaining of such a revolution.\r\n\r\nAmong these revolutions of nature, we never reckon common\r\ninundations, such as take place at present from water overflowing its\r\nboundaries, though these also may produce devastation whose effects\r\nremain visible for an hundred years. But, in mountainous districts,\r\nanother kind of aqueous eruption makes its appearance, and may be\r\nclassed along with the traditions of a deluge. We very frequently,\r\nfor instance, observe the valleys of high mountains forming a range\r\nof basins separated from one another by shorter or longer defiles,\r\nand opening through the last defile into a wider valley, or a marsh.\r\nThe shape of these basins, or cauldrons, commonly lying above one\r\nanother like so many stories, and the level surface of their water,\r\nleave no doubt of their being once enclosed lakes which were formerly\r\nblocked up by the barriers of the defiles, and which flowed towards\r\nthe level country, as soon as the defiles were broken down by the\r\nwaters. If no kind of historical monuments in the west of Europe\r\nbears evidence of those events, which, at least on a small scale,\r\noccur in our own times, this intimates that it was inhabited, not by\r\nan original population, but by a foreign or modern race of people;\r\nwhereas those revolutions extended to remote antiquity. The numerous\r\nmasses of rock found on both sides of the Alps to the height of\r\n4000 feet, as well as in the plains of the north of Europe, at a\r\ngreat distance from their original position, and concerning whose\r\ncoming hither so much light has lately been thrown by Messrs Buch\r\nand Escher, are a very probable proof of these debacles; while every\r\ncircumstance renders it evident that these blocks were swept along\r\nby the currents thus created, to the place where they are now found.\r\nThe Greek writers have also preserved accounts of such revolutions,\r\nwhich, although not unquestionably authenticated, are yet stamped\r\nwith the impress of historical testimony. Herodotus has the following\r\npassages directly relative to the country where the Greeks place\r\ntheir second or Deucalionic deluge. “Thessaly must formerly have\r\nbeen an inland sea, surrounded by high mountains. On the east it was\r\nbounded by Pelios and Ossa, whose bases were united; on the north by\r\nOlympus; on the west by Pindus; and on the south by Othrys. Thessaly\r\nlay in the midst of these mountains in the form of a basin, into\r\nwhich, in conjunction with other copious streams, the five well-known\r\nrivers, the Peneus, the Apidanus, the Orochomenus, the Enipeus, and\r\nthe Pamisos, emptied themselves. These rivers, which are collected in\r\ntheir basin from the mountains which encompass Thessaly, after their\r\njunction under the name of Peneus, in which they lose their former\r\nappellation, open towards the sea through a narrow valley. According\r\nto tradition, this valley and opening did not formerly exist; so\r\nthat the rivers and the Lake Brebeis, which did not formerly bear\r\nthese names, having their confluence in this place, rendered the\r\nwhole of Thessaly an inland sea. The Thessalians affirm that Neptune\r\nopened the valley for the passage of the river Peneus, and they may\r\nperhaps be right. If we consider Neptune the author of earthquakes,\r\nand consider the violent concussion of the mountains caused by them\r\nas the work of this deity, we must, upon surveying these regions,\r\nconfess that they owe their present shape to him; for the separation\r\nof every mountain appears to me to have been produced by some violent\r\ncommotion of the earth.” Strabo makes mention of this tradition,\r\nwhich he thought worthy of belief, and accounts for the origin of the\r\nVale of Tempe, which is the bed of the river Peneus, and likewise for\r\nthe separation of Ossa from Olympus, by means of an earthquake[405].\r\nIn making this remark, we perceive that our theories which allow\r\nthat earthquakes are to operate in forming the surface of the earth,\r\nhave not even the merit of novelty. According to the last writer,\r\nsimilar eruptions of water must have originated in the lake Copais in\r\nBœotia[406], in the lakes Bistonis and Aphnetis, in Thrace, and have\r\nbeen accompanied with huge devastation[407]. Diodorus Siculus[408]\r\nremembered a Samothracian tradition, according to which the Euxine\r\nSea was once shut up on all sides. It afterwards burst through its\r\nmighty mound of _kyanischen_ rocks to the Hellespont, and inundated\r\na great part of the coast of Asia, as well as Samothracia itself. An\r\nobjection started to the possibility of such an event is, that, from\r\nthe observations of Olivier and General Andreossy, the shores of the\r\nBlack Sea are, in most places, lower than those of the Bosphorus; and\r\nthat its waters, therefore, even if they were considerably higher\r\nthan they are at present, would more readily overflow the former than\r\nthe latter. But since every rock exposed for such a length of time\r\nis daily crumbling down, it is a question, whether the shore of the\r\nBlack Sea has undergone any alteration since that period; and we know\r\nthat the eruptions took their direction, not so much from the low\r\nsituation of the barrier, as from the nature of the rock of which it\r\nwas constructed, being influenced by the weather, and from the rock\r\nitself being rent asunder. Be that as it may, the words with which\r\nDiodorus commences his narrative are remarkable, when he says, the\r\nSamothracian deluge happened earlier than those of other nations.\r\nIt at least so far preceded others, that, in the estimation of the\r\nGreek historian, independent of the deluges of Ogyges and Deucalion,\r\nsimilar natural occurrences more or less authenticated were received\r\nas historical facts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the effects produced by the bursting of lakes or debacles\r\ndo not appear to be out of proportion to the devastation mentioned\r\nby the traditions of nations. To abide by our former example,\r\nfloods which could carry along with them masses of rock of 50,000\r\ncubic feet, were in a situation to bury a whole people; and the few\r\nindividuals who might be preserved would undoubtedly have handed\r\ndown the memory of such an event to remote posterity. Other deluges\r\nmay have arisen from other causes, at a time when, as is shewn by\r\nnumerous vestiges, lakes and rivers had a much greater elevation\r\nthan at present; and, therefore, every overflowing of them must have\r\nproduced greater and more extensive ravages.\r\n\r\nFrom these last local eruptions of water, that is, from single\r\nlimited districts, arose the mechanical precipitates known under the\r\ndenomination of Alluvial Soil. Their situation, as the uppermost\r\ncovering of the earth, as well as their origin, which takes place\r\nbeneath our own observation, furnishes evidence of their being the\r\nmost recent mineral formations; and it follows from their nature and\r\nconnection that they were not produced by chemical means, but removed\r\nby the mechanical force of water. Since they, among other things,\r\ncontain prostrate forests, and abundant remains of land animals, we\r\nconclude that they did not originate in the bed of the sea, but were\r\nfloated and deposited upon the dry land by an overflow of land water.\r\nHow is it conceivable that these precipitates have been covered by\r\nthe ocean, since their deposition, and have, by means of an opposite\r\nchange, become the dry land they are at present; and yet it must have\r\nbeen so, if they are to be considered as intimations of the Mosaic\r\ndeluge.\r\n\r\nThe view now given, which is that of Henger in his Beiträge, is also\r\nadvocated by other naturalists, and has lately been brought forward\r\nin an interesting manner in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal[409].\r\nWe have been frequently requested to give the two views, in regard\r\nto the universal deluge, namely, that which maintains that it is\r\nproved by an appeal to the phenomena of the mineral kingdom; the\r\nother, which affirms that that great event has left no traces of its\r\nexistence on the surface or in the interior of the earth. M. Cuvier’s\r\nEssay, and Professor Buckland’s Reliquiæ, are the best authorities\r\nfor the first opinion; while numerous writers have advocated the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE, p. 244.\r\n\r\nON THE ACTION OF RUNNING WATERS.\r\n\r\nA very great degree of power has been attributed to the waters\r\nwhich move at the surface of the earth, or in its interior. Many\r\ngeologists have advanced the opinion, that they have scooped out the\r\nchannels and even the valleys in which they flow, and formed the\r\ncliffs whose feet they wash; and many philosophers, naturalists and\r\neven geologists, still support this opinion, not only in some of its\r\napplications, but even in its whole extent.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate it, it is sufficient to observe with care the\r\ndifferent modes of action of water set in motion by different causes,\r\nand the changes which it has operated upon the rocks and deposits\r\nupon which it has acted, from the most remote times to which history\r\nmay reach.\r\n\r\nWe must, in the first place, successively examine the different sorts\r\nof action of the principal masses of water which are in motion at\r\nthe surface of the earth, that is to say, the action of torrents, of\r\nrivers, of currents of the sea, or of great lakes, and that of waves.\r\n\r\nWe shall afterwards see what consequences are to be deduced from\r\nthese observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Action of Torrents._\r\n\r\n_Torrents_ have a true degrading and _scooping_ action upon the\r\nearth’s surface, but, by the necessary consequence of the sense\r\nwhich we attach to the word, this action cannot be exercised upon\r\nspaces of great extent, for a torrent is a water-course which has a\r\ngreat declivity. Now, on account of the little height which the most\r\nelevated summits of the globe have in comparison with the extent\r\nof its surface, this action cannot be very extensive; it can only,\r\ntherefore, produce short and narrow ravines. This action, as all who\r\nhave visited high mountain chains may have seen, is only often local\r\nand instantaneous; it presents no remarkable effect but upon the\r\nheaps of debris which cover the declivities of the mountains, and on\r\nbroken rocks, partially disintegrated by other causes, and lastly on\r\nmoveable deposits. The results of this action contribute to confine\r\nit within narrower limits still, by heaping up at the mouths of\r\ntorrents in the valleys or plains, the debris carried down by these\r\ntorrents. The elevation of the soil, which necessarily follows from\r\nthe accumulation of these debris, diminishes with the declivity, the\r\nrapidity, and consequently the power of these water-courses.\r\n\r\nGreat masses of water moving rapidly, have a marked transporting\r\npower. Striking examples of this power have but too often been\r\nseen in Holland, by the breaking down of the dikes, and in Alpine\r\nmountains, in consequence of extraordinary rains during tempests,\r\nor from the rupture of some of the natural barriers of lakes. In\r\nthese latter times (in 1818), the Vallée de Bagne experienced the\r\nterrible effects of this devastating power. Masses of ice having\r\nfallen towards the upper part of this valley, and accumulated\r\nthere, raised a dike sufficiently compact and strong to block up\r\nthe course of the Dranse. The waters of this river, rapid and pent\r\nup in certain parts of its course, as are all those of the high\r\nAlps, accumulated above this barrier of ice, and formed a lake which\r\nattained, at its maximum, 130 metres of mean breadth, from 3000 to\r\n4000 metres of length, and 36 of mean depth, and consequently a\r\nvolume of water estimated at about 29,000,000 cubic metres. Although,\r\nby means of operations conducted with equal skill and courage,\r\nabout the third part of this volume was let off without danger, the\r\nremaining part having suddenly broken through the barrier of ice,\r\nwas precipitated with an almost unexampled impetuosity of 11 metres\r\nin the second, into the Vallée de Bagne. In the first part of its\r\ncourse, and in the space of half an hour which the mass of water took\r\nin traversing a league, it carried away trees, dwellings, enormous\r\nmasses of debris, and rocks _already separated from their mass_, as\r\nM. Escher, expressly says; it covered all the broad parts of the\r\nvalley with rubbish, pebbles and sand, and carried the remainder of\r\nthe substances which it had swept away, as well to the extremity\r\nof the valley, towards Martigny, as into the bed of the Rhone. The\r\nmass of water took an hour and a half in rushing from the glacier to\r\nMartigny. The same event took place from the same cause, and with\r\nnearly similar results, in 1595.\r\n\r\nTorrents may therefore scoop out ravines in certain formations, and\r\nproduce effects which appear considerable, because we judge of them\r\nby comparison with our own feeble means. But how diminutive and\r\ncircumscribed are these changes produced in the configuration of\r\nthe globe, compared with the long and broad valleys which furrow in\r\nvast numbers the immense surface of the earth, and to the formation\r\nof which neither the torrents nor great rivers which exist at the\r\npresent day have in any way contributed, as we shall presently\r\ndemonstrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Action of Rivers._\r\n\r\nThe action of _rivers_ must be examined under two very different\r\ncircumstances, or at two different parts of their course.\r\n\r\n_First_, When they are compressed between mountains, whether at no\r\ngreat distance from their source, or even at the middle of their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, When they have reached broad valleys, whose declivity is\r\nslight, or plains which commonly surround their mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, these rivers partake of the impetuosity and power\r\nof torrents. They often run with rapidity, and in great quantity, at\r\nthe bottom of narrow and deep valleys: they are as it were inclosed\r\nin channels, whose vertical walls appear as if cut by art. The first\r\nidea which presents itself to all who have seen these appearances\r\nfor the first time, and who are satisfied with first impressions,\r\nis, that these streams, which are pretty powerful and always very\r\nimpetuous, have dug these deep grooves; and if sometimes the hardness\r\nof the rocks and the height of the precipices which form their\r\nsides, appear too great for those small streams that meander at\r\ntheir feet, what cannot be attributed to their immediate power is\r\nattributed to the continued action of time.\r\n\r\nWithout examining how long a series of ages it would be necessary\r\nto admit, before the rivers which we have mentioned above, and the\r\nwater-courses encased in the deep valleys of the Alps, Pyrenees,\r\nJura, Grampians, &c. could have scooped their valleys, on which their\r\npresent action is so slow that no one has yet been able to estimate\r\nit; without examining if this long series of ages agrees with the\r\nphenomena, which preclude our attributing so remote an antiquity\r\nto the actual state of the earth’s surface, a question of too much\r\nimportance to be treated indirectly; it will be sufficient to mention\r\nhere four sorts of observations, in order to be persuaded, or at\r\nleast to suspect, that the present rivers, even supposing them ten\r\ntimes the size that they are, could not have scooped out the deep\r\nchannels at the bottom of which they run.\r\n\r\n1. We must recur to the period when the ranges of hills which border\r\nthe present valleys were not as yet scooped out, but were united in\r\nsuch a manner as not to leave any hollow between them, or merely a\r\nslight original depression.\r\n\r\nThis shallowness of the valley would be accompanied with an\r\ninconsiderable slope of its bottom. If, then, we suppose the same\r\nmass of water, it must run with less quickness, and consequently\r\nwith much less power; and yet a very great force must be attributed\r\nto it, before it could have had the power of removing a portion of\r\nrock nearly represented by a recumbent triangular prism, having often\r\n500 metres of breadth by a sometimes equal and often much greater\r\nvertical thickness. If, in order to get rid of this difficulty, we\r\nadmit a volume of water incomparably larger than the present volume\r\nof the rivers to which so great effects are attributed, we must admit\r\nmuch more elevated and more extended mountains, to give rise to so\r\ngreat a volume of water.\r\n\r\nWere we only detained by this hypothesis, and did not direct\r\nobservation oppose itself to the admission of this disaggregating\r\npower and its effect, we might pass it over; but two other\r\nobservations render the hypothesis inadmissible.\r\n\r\n2. Historical records equally concur to prove that the rivers\r\npossessed of the greatest power which can be attributed to them, have\r\nno appreciable corroding action upon the rocks on which they move.\r\n\r\nNo one has maintained that the greater number of the cascades,\r\ncataracts, or rapids, long known and mentioned on account of their\r\ncelebrity, have disappeared or have even sensibly diminished, nor\r\nconsequently that the natural dike which the water had encountered\r\nin its course, has been worn or even completely disrupted. We do\r\nnot find that cascades have changed into cataracts, and these again\r\ninto rapids. The cataracts of the Nile have been spoken of from time\r\nimmemorial, as always opposing an obstacle to the navigation of that\r\nriver; the same is the case with those of the Danube, of the fall of\r\nthe Rhine at Schaffhausen, &c. The famous cascades of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees have been cited ever since writing was in use; and among all\r\nthese examples we can scarcely find two or three cascades that have\r\nbeen lowered, or cataracts reduced in their level.\r\n\r\nThe only cascade which we can point out as having really diminished\r\nin height, is that of Tungasca in Siberia. We do not, however, assert\r\nbut that there may be others. So many causes different from those\r\nof erosion may concur to lower a cascade, or even make it disappear\r\nalmost entirely, that we are rather astonished at the small number\r\nof examples mentioned, than embarrassed by the objections which\r\nthese examples might present to the opinion which we are defending:\r\nfor the fall of a part of the rock which forms the cliff from which\r\nthe cascade is precipitated; an abundant accumulation of debris at\r\nthe foot of the cliff; a real destruction of the softer deposits,\r\nforming part of the strata of the mountain from which they fall, are\r\nsufficient causes for changing the height of waterfalls. These causes\r\nmust present themselves pretty frequently; but how different is their\r\naction from that of erosion? This, if it existed, would extend from\r\nthe source of the river to its mouth, and would have a considerable\r\ninfluence upon the configuration of the earth’s surface. Those which\r\nwe have mentioned have, on the contrary, an action so limited and so\r\nlocal, as to be scarcely appreciable.\r\n\r\n3. Allowing, for the moment, that a river, possessed of a vast\r\nerosive or disaggregating power, may have scooped out the valley in\r\nthe bottom of which it at present flows, in a state of feebleness\r\nvery different from its original state, we must account for the\r\ndisposal of a vast mass of earth and rock, which filled up the valley\r\nbefore the river had removed it. It is not possible to suppose that\r\nit has been transported into the sea, which is often more than a\r\nhundred leagues from the valley; for we know that when rivers, on\r\nreaching the plains, lose their rapidity, they allow the matters to\r\nbe precipitated which they held in suspension. Besides, we have\r\nshown that many rivers, on leaving the mountains, traverse lakes, in\r\nwhich they deposit all the earthy matters suspended in their waters.\r\nThis deposition is particularly striking in all the considerable\r\nrivers, which descend from the ridge of the Alps toward the\r\nnorth-west and south-east of that chain of mountains. These rivers\r\nmeet, at the opening of the valleys they flow through, lakes, which\r\nthey traverse, and which seem intended for their purification. Thus,\r\non the northern side, we see the Rhone traversing the lake of Geneva;\r\nthe Aar, the Lakes of Brientz and Thun; the Reuss, the Lake of the\r\nFour Cantons; the Linth, the Lake of Zurich; the Rhine, the Lake of\r\nConstance. On the south side, the Lac Majeur is traversed by the\r\nTessin, the Lake of Como by the Adda, the Lake Disco by the Oglio;\r\nthe Lake of Guarda by the Mincio, &c. Now, these lakes, which are\r\nonly themselves deeper parts of the valley, would have been filled up\r\nby the debris conveyed to the valley, if this valley had the origin\r\nattributed to it. Proceeding from one hypothesis to another, it might\r\nperhaps be supposed that these lakes may have been sufficiently deep\r\nto swallow up all the debris of the valley, without being chocked up.\r\nBut, rather than admit such suppositions, why not grant that the same\r\nunknown cause which has scooped out the lake, has also scooped out\r\nthe valley which is only a continuation of it?\r\n\r\n4. But if facts had proved that the waters degrade the rocks, scoop\r\nthem out, and perpetually remove their debris, we might perhaps be\r\ninduced to admit that unknown causes, of which we are absolutely\r\nignorant, and of which we can form no idea, have given to the\r\noriginal rivers the means of surmounting all these obstacles. Now,\r\nobservation would seem absolutely to prove the contrary.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked, that rapid rivers which, in the bottom of valleys,\r\nfall in cascades, from rock to rock, which beat with violence against\r\nthe walls which contain them, do not in any degree alter these\r\nrocks, and that, far from corroding their surface, they allow it to\r\nbe covered with a rich coating of mosses, confervæ, &c. which could\r\nneither maintain itself, nor be formed at all, were the least portion\r\nof the surface of these rocks continually or even only frequently\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nA much more striking fact is that which some of the great rivers\r\npresent, such as the Nile, the Orinoco, &c. which flow in the\r\nequatorial regions.\r\n\r\nThese powerful rivers, when they have arrived at places where they\r\nare contracted, and, as it were, jammed in between two rocky walls,\r\nform impetuous cataracts. Their waters, endowed by the celerity of\r\nthis fall with the greatest erosive power that can be attributed to\r\nthis fluid, must necessarily have corroded, or at least worn, the\r\nrocks which they have thus beat against since the creation of our\r\npresent Continent. Now, so far from removing the surface, they cover\r\nit with a brownish varnish of a peculiar nature.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, well established, that water _alone_ does not\r\nscoop those rocks, whose aggregation is complete, or which are solid;\r\nand that it does not wear them in any way, whatever be its quantity\r\nof motion.\r\n\r\nWe say _water alone_; and we must insist on this distinction, in\r\norder to make the preceding facts agree with other facts, which might\r\nseem contradictory.\r\n\r\nWe often see furrows scooped out on the walls that bound the narrows\r\nof rivers; we also see rocks rounded, and entirely destitute of moss.\r\nBut let the facts be examined with attention, and we shall find that\r\nthis erosion always takes place in the parts of their course, where,\r\non account of the nature of the neighbouring soil, the torrents carry\r\nwith them, in their risings (or floods), debris and detached stones\r\nfrom their banks; and it is by means of these stones that they wear\r\nthe rocks which are in their bed.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to appreciate these circumstances. It is remarked,\r\nthat this erosion has never taken place at the sources of powerful\r\nsprings. All the pebbles which had to be carried off have been so\r\nlong ago, and the mosses which grow abundantly on the rocks at the\r\nlevel of the water, and in the bed of these torrents, have nothing\r\nmore to fear from the destructive action of these solid bodies. The\r\ncase is the same with the parts which immediately succeed a lake, or\r\na great excavation, capable of arresting all the hard bodies carried\r\noff by the river. There the mosses appear in abundance; because they\r\nare not subjected to the action of any other substance than of the\r\nwater alone.\r\n\r\nThe present rivers do not therefore appear to have any erosive power\r\nupon the rocks which are completely aggregated, when they act by\r\nthemselves, and when no other cause, such as frost, decomposition,\r\n&c. has disintegrated the rock. The absence of these foreign\r\ncircumstances is proved by the vegetation or the enamel which then\r\ncover the rocks exposed to the action of the water.\r\n\r\nThese rivers, in proportion as they remove from the rocks in the\r\nneighbourhood of the lofty mountains in which they took their rise,\r\noften gain in volume what they have lost in velocity; but the power\r\ndependent upon size rarely compensates that which they owed to\r\nrapidity; and although these large rivers still retain a transporting\r\npower, sufficient to carry along with them the obstacles which oppose\r\nthemselves to their progress, they are far from presenting results\r\nof action so striking as those of torrents. They stir up, when\r\nflooded, or when they change place, the earth and mobile sand which\r\ncover their bottom, especially towards their edges, and transport\r\nthem to some distance; but they scarcely move pebbles larger than an\r\negg, which occur in their bed, and which have been brought there in\r\nother times, and under other circumstances. On thus transporting the\r\ncomminuted and mobile mineral matters, they deposite them again in\r\nplaces where their current is relaxed by some cause, and thus raise\r\nthe bottom of their bed in these places; they seek a new passage in\r\nthe midst of the barriers which they have themselves constructed.\r\nThe principal current is then borne, sometimes against one bank, and\r\nsometimes against the other; and when it comes to beat upon the foot\r\nof a steep part, composed of moveable soil, as the banks commonly\r\nare, in such cases, they really erode it, and make it fall into\r\nthe river; and transport to another part of its course, the earth\r\nresulting from the destruction of the bank, and give rise to new\r\nobstacles. Hence the new deposites, which border rivers in all points\r\nwhere their current is slackened, and principally toward their mouth.\r\nIt is sufficient for our present purpose to have referred to facts\r\nremarkable for their number, for the importance which they have had\r\nin regard to the modern changes of the configuration of the globe;\r\nand, lastly, in regard to agriculture and civilisation;--facts of\r\neasy observation, and which tend to prove, that the action of rivers,\r\nwhose fall is not sufficiently rapid to entitle them to be considered\r\nas torrents, is not to scoop out their bed, either in the valleys or\r\nin the plains through which they flow, but rather to raise them, and\r\nto tend, consequently, rather to level and flatten the earth than to\r\nfurrow it, more than it has been since the Continents have assumed\r\nthe configuration which they now possess.\r\n\r\nBut if we have not been able to recognise a real corroding power in\r\nthe great rivers falling in the form of cascades or cataracts, let\r\nus inquire elsewhere, in circumstances where the water seems endowed\r\nwith a still superior power, what are the effects of this agent?\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Action of Waves._\r\n\r\nIt is in the sea, an enormous mass, sometimes acquiring, from the\r\naction of the winds, an incalculable power, that we must find the\r\nmaximum of force of the water of the _present_ times. In fact, in\r\nthis case, the power of transportation is so prodigious, that the\r\nstrongest barriers, both natural and artificial, are overturned, and\r\nthe largest stones, together with enormous fragments of rocks torn\r\nfrom their place, transported, and even projected to a distance.\r\nBut it is to these effects that this immeasurable power is limited.\r\nThe water, which displaces and transports to a distance these heavy\r\nmasses, does not abrade the surface when it acts by itself. We see\r\nthis surface, on rocks and the sides of piers and dikes, perpetually\r\nbeaten by the waves, covered with fuci, confervæ, byssi, and other\r\ndelicate vegetables, _without roots_, which the waves have not\r\nprevented from contracting a first and feeble adherence, and which\r\nthey do not hinder from growing. But, if the waves carry with them\r\npebbles, or even sand, it is those hard bodies which act; the surface\r\nof the rocks is abraded, and all vegetation ceases.\r\n\r\nThe same effect takes place, and is even augmented by the real\r\ndegradation of the coasts, if the sea acts upon friable rocks,\r\ncapable of mixing with water, such as argillaceous or calcareous\r\nmarl, or chalk, or upon rocks which are hard, but naturally fissured,\r\nor partly disaggregated, such as certain granites; it then easily\r\nremoves the crumbled or previously detached parts, scoops out the\r\nfoot of the rock or steep coast, and causes the upper part, which is\r\ndeprived of support, to fall. But, in consequence of this fall, it\r\nforms a slope, which, by its inclination, deadens the violence of the\r\nshock, and even protects the foot of the cliff, for some time only,\r\nif it be friable, or capable of disintegration; and for ever, if,\r\nbeing compact, it does not carry in it the causes of destruction. The\r\naction of the waves ceasing, the slope is covered with vegetation;\r\nand if the coast continues, nevertheless, to be worn, the changes are\r\nthen owing to causes unconnected with the action of water.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in few words, the ordinary action of the water of the sea\r\nupon steep coasts, and even that of great masses of water in a\r\nstate of agitation. M. De Luc, in his various works, has estimated\r\nthis action with a correctness of observation and of reasoning,\r\nwhich is remarkable only, because it has not been adopted by all\r\nnaturalists; and few have bestowed the unremitting attention upon\r\nthe subject which this respectable geologist has done. He has shewn,\r\nthat the destructive action of the waters upon steep shores, and\r\nother coasts or abrupt cliffs, was considerably restrained by the\r\nvery consequences of this action; that the debris which accumulated\r\nprotected the lower parts of these coasts from the action of the\r\nwater, or gradually reduced an abrupt coast to a very inclined and\r\npermanent slope.\r\n\r\nNext, to _torrents_, to rapid and large _rivers_, and to _waves_,\r\nit is to _currents_ that a great influence on the earth’s surface\r\nhas been attributed,--an influence which a highly gifted naturalist,\r\nBuffon, has employed to explain all the inequalities of the earth’s\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the action of currents is less precise than that\r\nwhich we possess of rivers. But if we cannot so visibly demonstrate\r\nthat, in no circumstance similar to those which we have specified,\r\ndo they scoop out the bottom of the sea into valleys, nor form any\r\nmountains, we can, at least, conjecture with much probability, and\r\nmaintain, that we have no direct and constant proof of that action.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Action of Currents._\r\n\r\nNo one doubts that currents, near coasts, heap up upon the beach,\r\nat the mouth of rivers and harbours, pebbles, sand, gravel, mud, or\r\nother transportable matters, whether these currents constantly exist,\r\nor simply result from the momentary action of a predominating wind;\r\nbut this action, although already limited to the mobile matters which\r\nform the bottom of the sea only in some parts, whether this action,\r\nI say, extends to a great depth, that is to several hundred yards,\r\nis a question not yet resolved. In the first place, the observation\r\nmade by mariners, that, in the most violent tempests, the sea is only\r\nagitated towards the coasts, or on shallows, and that bodies, sunk\r\nto a great depth, (and still what is this depth in comparison with\r\nthat of the sea,) do not feel the motions of its surface, nor that of\r\ncurrents; and, secondly, reasoning, and even calculation, according\r\nto Messieurs La Place and Poisson, concur to shew, that the violent\r\nmotions of the waters of the sea are not propagated to a great depth.\r\nIt is therefore probable, that all the transportable matters, which\r\nare at this depth, must remain nearly in the position in which they\r\nare, since our Continents have assumed their present configuration,\r\nunless phenomena and motions of the sea take place at the bottom, of\r\nwhich we are ignorant, and which are foreign to the subject which at\r\npresent occupies our attention.\r\n\r\nBut if we have no perfectly certain ideas regarding the propagation\r\nof the motions of the sea in depth, we can assert, that, whatever\r\nthat extent and that power may be, the submarine currents no more\r\nabrade the rocks than rivers do the surface of the land. This\r\nproof is always derived from the same kind of fact, namely, from\r\nthe vegetable and animal bodies which constantly cover the rocks,\r\nand which are found, at all times, by means of various sorts of\r\ndredge-fishing. In fact, no one has remarked, that the places in\r\nwhich oysters, mussels, corals and sponges are fished, are more\r\nsheltered from currents than others; nor that these places, after\r\nviolent tempests, have been deprived, and consequently, as it were,\r\ndespoiled of those productions, which, by covering the rocks,\r\ndemonstrate that they preserve the integrity of their surface. Many\r\nof these bodies, however, as sponges, fuci and confervæ, contract but\r\na feeble adherence to the bodies upon which they are placed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears, if not completely proved, at least extremely\r\nprobable, from the facts and reasonings which we have related,\r\n\r\n1. That the _presently existing_ waters, that is to say, in the state\r\nof purity in which we are acquainted with them, have no erosive\r\naction upon rocks, whatever be the nature of these rocks, when, 1st,\r\nThe rocks are completely solid, and when they are neither friable\r\nnor disintegrated; 2d, When these waters act by themselves, that is\r\nto say, when their action is not complicated with the really erosive\r\naction of solid bodies, such as pebbles, sand, and perhaps even\r\npieces of ice.\r\n\r\n2. That water, sometimes acquiring, on account of its quality and\r\nvelocity, a great transporting power, may remove masses, already\r\ndetached, and of great size, according to its degree of velocity, and\r\nthe bulk of its mass, and so far as it preserves this same power.\r\n\r\n3. That the presently existing waters may have attacked, undermined,\r\nand caused to fall down, portions of solid and steep rocks, by mixing\r\nwith beds of clay, marl, and sand, interposed between their solid\r\nstrata; that they may also, in their rapid falls, have scooped pretty\r\ndeep ravines in very inclined deposites, consisting of disintegrated\r\nrocks; but that these waters could not have scooped out, either\r\nby a violent action, or by a slow one, however long continued, any\r\nof those long and broad longitudinal depressions, which are named\r\nvalleys, or of those narrow openings, with almost vertical walls,\r\nwhich are named _gorges_ or ravines.\r\n\r\n4. That, even when the deposites, which border these valleys or\r\nthese ravines, are composed of transportable matter, the waters\r\nwhich at present flow in them could not have scooped them out, even\r\nsupposing them to have been much larger in some than they now are;\r\nthe declivity of the present deposite not being sufficiently great to\r\ngive to these masses of water the rapidity necessary for producing\r\nthis effect, and a power sufficient for carrying off the moveable\r\nmatters which filled the valley or gorge.\r\n\r\n5. Lastly, that the present running waters, so far from having\r\ncontributed to form the numerous valleys, glens, gorges and ravines,\r\ncontinually tend to fill them up, and rather to level the surface of\r\nthe globe than to furrow it, more deeply than it is.\r\n\r\n  _Vid._ Brongniart _sur l’Eau_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\n_On the Connection of Geology with Agriculture and Planting[410]._\r\n\r\nThat all sorts of soils are not equally adapted to all productions,\r\nis a remark of Virgil’s, the truth of which becomes obvious, when\r\nwe consider many facts ascertained in Agriculture and Forestry. If,\r\ntherefore, as the poet advises, our object be to determine what each\r\nparticular region can produce, and what it cannot, our attention\r\nought in the first place to be directed to the physical circumstances\r\nwhich exert their influence over vegetation.\r\n\r\nAll plants that are the subject of cultivation are fixed in the\r\nground. By one of their parts, through which they derive their\r\nprincipal nourishment, they penetrate into the soil, which serves\r\nthem as a basis, and affords them the means of procuring subsistence;\r\nby the other part they raise themselves into the atmosphere, which\r\nis not only necessary in itself for their existence, but is also the\r\nmedium through which they derive the warming and vivifying influence\r\nof the solar rays. Hence we can understand how much the existence of\r\nplants must be influenced by differences in the condition of the soil\r\nand air.\r\n\r\nThe superficial crust of the globe is formed of soil capable\r\nof producing vegetables. This productive soil, however, is not\r\neverywhere continuous, being interrupted on the one hand by the\r\nwatery covering of the earth, and on the other by perennial snow and\r\nbare rock. Where soil does occur, it separates the solid mass of the\r\nearth from the atmosphere, and is the porous medium through which the\r\ngaseous and watery parts of the latter may act in a greater or less\r\ndegree upon the former. It is very seldom that strata of vegetable\r\nsoil lie beneath strata of other matters; and where they occur in\r\nthis position, the overlying strata are either of volcanic or of\r\nalluvial origin. Of the former case, a very remarkable example occurs\r\nin the Isle of Bourbon, in which large tracts covered with vegetables\r\nand even trees, have been laid waste and overwhelmed by streams of\r\nlava; and large rivers in their overflowings occasionally leave\r\ndeposits of various characters, over the productive soil containing\r\nremains of formerly existing plants.\r\n\r\nProductive soil, as well in regard to its _situation_ as to its\r\n_constitution_, depends upon the nature and condition of the rocks\r\nwhich form the solid mass of the earth. It is always of secondary\r\nformation, compared with the rock on which it rests, its principal\r\nparts usually originating from the decomposition of this rock. While\r\nthe forms of the surface of the solid mass of the earth, have much\r\ninfluence upon the action of the atmosphere, they also in some degree\r\nmodify that of climate. From these circumstances it would appear that\r\nthe solid substrata of productive soil exert an influence in various\r\nways upon vegetables; whence it follows that, in order to obtain a\r\nmore intimate knowledge of the conditions which operate upon their\r\nexistence, it is necessary to call in geology to our assistance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the scientific study of agriculture has made great progress\r\nin our times, the relations which exist between the constitution\r\nof the solid crust of the earth, and the formation and nature of\r\nvegetable soil, present a wide field for investigation. Geologists\r\nhave hitherto too much neglected the examination of the productive\r\ncovering of the earth, and those who have treated scientifically\r\nof agriculture and forestry have usually looked upon the vegetable\r\nsoil in its own simple capacity, without regard to its foundation\r\nand origin. To point out the way by which we are to proceed in our\r\ninvestigation of the relations which exist between the solid crust of\r\nthe earth and the productive soil which covers it, is the principal\r\nobject of the following observations.\r\n\r\nBare rocks cannot be made subservient to the purposes of agriculture.\r\nLichens indeed, cover the surface of rocks, deriving their chief\r\nnutriment from the atmosphere; mosses draw the water necessary for\r\ntheir subsistence from the fissures of stones; the roots of grasses\r\nseek in the chinks of rocks for particles of earth sufficient for\r\ntheir sustenance; various shrubs and trees penetrate here and there\r\ninto rocky masses by their roots (having the powerful and continued\r\naction of living wedges), where the cohesion of the parts is\r\nsmallest, in order to prepare a fixed seat for themselves, and be\r\nsecure from the pernicious effects of the atmosphere. The surface of\r\nthe earth is always sterile, however, when it shows a continuity of\r\nnaked rock, uncovered by vegetable mould. The cultivation of fields\r\nand woods, and even the rearing of cattle, cannot therefore find\r\nscope in regions which are entirely rocky. Abrupt and precipitous\r\nmountains being generally in this condition are usually barren; but\r\nin plains and on declivities, a bare rocky surface is much less\r\nfrequently the cause of sterility than an unfavourable proportion\r\nof mould. Some rocky and moderately elevated regions also occur,\r\nmore or less destitute of vegetable mould, whose sterility depends\r\nupon volcanic causes. Iceland, for example, affords cases of this\r\ndescription. In many parts of Sweden, as in Westrogothia, in\r\nScotland, &c., there occur many elevated regions, in which gneiss\r\nand granite predominating, exclude to a great extent all kinds of\r\nvegetation excepting lichens. In the same districts we sometimes meet\r\nwith pastures and corn-fields interrupted here and there by bare\r\nrocks rising but little above the surface, by which the value of\r\nthe ground is much diminished, and great impediments opposed to its\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nAs bare rocks are incapable of all cultivation, their distance\r\nfrom the under surface of vegetable mould must also be of great\r\nimportance. In the plains of the north of Germany, for example, this\r\ndistance is often so great that a rocky surface is never found,\r\nwhile, on the contrary, in other countries, especially such as are\r\nmountainous, the roots of plants not unfrequently touch the subjacent\r\nrock; the variation between these extremes being of all degrees. The\r\neffect of the distance of the surface of the solid rock from the\r\nunder surface of productive soil may be both _direct_ and _indirect_,\r\nand may vary much, not only with reference to the species of rock,\r\nbut also to the vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the solid strata of the earth has a _direct_ influence\r\nupon the cultivation of plants, because it terminates the extension\r\nof their roots, and limits the volume of the soil necessary for their\r\nsustenance. As the length and direction of the roots vary exceedingly\r\nin different species, the difference of effect with regard to their\r\ngrowth, and the approximation of the rock to the under surface of the\r\nsoil, must in general be so much the less prejudicial in proportion\r\nas the roots decline from the perpendicular; whence it follows, that\r\ncertain grasses, and some small pasture plants, may grow in very\r\nthin layers of soil, where the larger grasses and pasture plants\r\nwith longer roots, could not find subsistence; and that shrubs and\r\ntrees, with long perpendicular roots, cannot survive in many places,\r\nwhere others with more horizontal roots may thrive. These inferences\r\nare proved to be correct by observations in agriculture and forestry\r\ngenerally known.\r\n\r\nMountainous regions, which are not so elevated but that corn might\r\ngrow sufficiently well in them, in so far as depends upon the\r\nconditions of the air or climate, are yet frequently not adapted for\r\nits cultivation, on account of the too near approach of the rock to\r\nthe surface, or shallowness of the soil, and produce nothing but\r\ngrasses, and some other pasture plants, among which, however, there\r\nis the greatest difference in this respect. _Trifolium montanum_, for\r\nexample, can support itself on rocky mountains, where _T. pratense_\r\ncould not grow. _Hedysarum onobrychis_ grows luxuriantly on the sunny\r\ndeclivities of calcareous mountains, where _Medicago sativa_ (Lucern)\r\ndoes not find a suitable station. The cultivation of this excellent\r\npasture plant in some mountainous regions, especially where the rocks\r\nare calcareous, has not proved so advantageous as might have been\r\nexpected, because the plants have died out in the course of a few\r\nyears; whereas, in proper places, where its very long roots find a\r\nsufficient depth of soil, they usually last for a great length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the rock to the under surface of the vegetable mould,\r\nor the shallowness of the soil, seems to be the principal cause\r\nwhy the _Beech_ grows better on many calcareous mountains than the\r\n_Oak_, which, on the other hand, finds a fitter station on mountains\r\nin which sandstone predominates, where the soil is usually deeper.\r\nIt would seem to be for a similar reason that the _Beech_ grows in\r\nmany rocky districts, for example, on the Hartz Mountains, at pretty\r\nconsiderable heights, especially on the sides of valleys which run to\r\nthe south, while these places do not admit the _Oak_, which is found\r\nin the middle provinces of Sweden and Norway; while the Beech, on the\r\nother hand, grows only in the southern parts. From the deficiency of\r\nsoil, the Upper Hartz can produce neither the _Pinus pinea_, nor _P.\r\nsylvestris_; the horizontal roots, however, of the _Abies_, or Norway\r\nSpruce, are content with the small portion of earth which covers the\r\ngreywacke and slate, although they cannot find sufficient hold to\r\nprotect its lofty trunks from being thrown down by the tempest. In\r\nsome parts of the Forest of Thuringia, where the covering of loose\r\nearth is deeper than in the Hartz, the _Pinus picea_, or pitch pine,\r\ngrows luxuriantly. The common fir, _Pinus sylvestris_, which attains\r\na great height in proper soil, on the contrary, is stunted and\r\ndistorted on rocky mountains, where the roots soon come in contact\r\nwith the rock. It there loses the character of a tree, and assumes\r\nthat of a shrub, as in place of a single upright stem, several\r\nbranches shoot out, and these, not unfrequently, are creeping or bent.\r\n\r\nThe different conditions of rocks, especially their structure\r\nand their state of cohesion, are of some importance in producing\r\nthese effects; for the surface of rocks must be detrimental or\r\nimpervious to the roots of plants, in proportion to the compactness\r\nof their structure, and the cohesion of their parts. Schistose\r\nrocks, for example, afford a more easy passage to roots, than\r\ngranular crystalline ones; pure quartz resists the roots of plants\r\nin the highest degree; sandstone much less; and pure limestone, on\r\naccount of its comparatively small number of fissures, is much less\r\nfavourable to vegetation than marl, chalk, or slightly cohering\r\ncalcareous rocks, the masses of which are usually split in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe direction and inclination of the strata have also some influence\r\nin this matter; for, in proportion as the principal fissures of\r\nthe strata are, from their direction or inclination, more readily\r\npresented to the roots of vegetables, the less prejudicial will\r\ntheir surface be to vegetation. Horizontal strata, therefore, are\r\nthe least favourable to vegetation, perpendicular ones the most. In\r\nthe inclination of strata intermediate in some degree between these\r\npositions, the roots of vegetables will find a greater obstacle on\r\nthe side of a hill in which the surface of a stratum is opposed to\r\nthem, than on the other, in which the principal fissures of the\r\nstrata are open. The effects of this circumstance may frequently be\r\nobserved in mountainous tracts having two principal inclinations, the\r\nstate of vegetation, and especially the growth of wood, being more\r\nprosperous on the one of these declivities than on the other.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the solid strata of the earth may also have an\r\n_indirect influence_ upon the cultivation of vegetables. The various\r\n_inclinations of this surface_ deserve first to be considered, being\r\nof the greatest effect with regard to fixing the fertile soil. The\r\nhorizontal position of a rocky surface is in the highest degree\r\nfavourable to the stability of vegetable earth; and the greater its\r\nangle of inclination, the greater is the danger of its losing the\r\nsoil upon it. In a highly inclined plane, the imperfect support\r\nof the centre of gravity is the sole cause of the loss of earth;\r\nin a less inclined plane the diminution of soil is usually caused\r\nby water, which produces this effect in a greater or less degree,\r\naccording to the difference of inclination. In both these modes, by\r\nwhich a removal of soil is produced, the effect may be modified by\r\na difference in the condition of the loose earth, as not only its\r\nstability as to situation, but also its resistance to the power of\r\nwater, vary according to the size, figure, and cohesion of the parts,\r\nas well as their adhesion to the surface of the rock. Sandy loose\r\nsoils, for example, are more liable to transposition than marly or\r\nloamy ones; and these, again, are more easily moved than such as are\r\nclayey and adhesive.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the nature of the soil, a small degree of inclination\r\nin the solid rock is sufficient to favour its denudation by the\r\nremoval of the former; and the inclinations of the surfaces of rocks\r\nhaving a covering of earth and vegetation, are in reality much less\r\nconsiderable than we usually suppose them to be, judging merely by\r\nthe eye. The celebrated Humboldt has published observations on this\r\nsubject. According to his measurements, a slope of even fifteen\r\ndegrees appears steep, and a declivity of thirty-seven degrees is so\r\nabrupt, that if it be covered with a dense sward, it can scarcely be\r\nclimbed. The inclination of the pastures of the Alps seldom exceeds\r\nan angle of ten or fifteen degrees, and a slope of twenty degrees\r\nis pretty steep. At an inclination of forty degrees, the surface\r\nof the rock is sometimes covered with earth bearing a sward, but\r\nat a greater inclination the rocks are usually destitute of soil\r\nand vegetation. In the Upper Hartz, the most common inclination of\r\nthe declivities of the mountains is twenty-five degrees; nor does\r\nit usually exceed thirty-three, at which inclination the _beech_\r\nand _spruce_ grow. The greatest declivities at which ground can be\r\nadvantageously cultivated have an inclination of thirty degrees.\r\n\r\nThe roots of vegetables, especially of grasses, shrubs, and trees,\r\nare of much importance in supporting the earth upon the declivities\r\nof rocks. Care must therefore be taken that the declivities of\r\nmountains which are covered with turf or wood, be not altogether\r\ndeprived of these coverings, as sometimes happens in consequence of\r\nloosening the turf for agricultural purposes, or of incautiously\r\nextirpating the wood. In Norway, near Roraas, there occur mountains,\r\ndestitute of all vegetation, that had formerly been covered with\r\nwoods, but where now, from the deficiency of soil, no seeds could\r\ntake root. The same is the case in many parts of the Alps, where,\r\nfrom the irregular long-continued removal of the timber, the sides\r\nof mountains which were formerly covered with thick woods, now show\r\nnothing but naked rocks. For this reason, in mountainous countries\r\nwith very steep declivities, the breeding of cattle and planting of\r\nwoods are often more advantageous than agriculture. In France the\r\ngreatest inclination of the public roads is limited by law to an\r\nangle of four degrees and forty-six minutes: a similar restriction\r\nwith regard to agriculture might not be without benefit in certain\r\nmountainous countries.\r\n\r\nThe inclinations of the surface of the solid crust of the earth vary\r\nmuch, according to the different qualities of the rocks; some having\r\na tendency to form abrupt precipices, others, again, to produce\r\ngentle declivities. For this reason, mountains consisting of quartz\r\nor porphyry, for example, very frequently present surfaces destitute\r\nof vegetation; while, on the other hand, those of granite, slate or\r\nsandstone, are more frequently adapted for agriculture and planting.\r\nIn the northern parts of Scotland, quartz rocks, destitute of all\r\nvegetation, rise in the midst of mountains covered with gramineous\r\nplants, and sometimes wood. In the most fertile part of the south of\r\nNorway porphyritic mountains rise from a calcareous and schistose\r\nbase, with lofty, rugged, and bare cliffs. In the southern parts of\r\nthe Tyrol the rocky sterility of the abrupt and lofty porphyritic\r\nmountains presents a striking contrast to the fertility of the\r\nneighbouring limestone mountains, which are covered with vines,\r\nwalnuts and chesnuts.\r\n\r\nThe _surface_ of the solid strata of the earth has also an indirect\r\ninfluence upon the cultivation of plants, in so far as the water\r\nwhich the vegetable mould acquires from the atmosphere, is retained\r\nin the soil, or is drawn off by the subjacent rock. Different rocks\r\nproduce very different effects in this respect, depending as well\r\nupon their constitution as their structure. The component parts of\r\nrocks imbibe water in different modes and degrees; and different\r\nsorts of rocks not only attract water with different celerity, but\r\nalso imbibe different quantities of it. The latter difference depends\r\nchiefly upon the various substances of which rocks are composed,\r\npartly, also, upon their porosity. Siliceous rocks attract water in\r\nthe lowest degree, argillaceous ones in the highest, and calcareous\r\nrocks appear to have an intermediate action in this respect.\r\nCompact and granular crystalline rocks attract water in a smaller\r\ndegree, and more slowly; friable or crumbled rocks imbibe it in\r\ngreater quantity, and with more celerity than those which are not\r\ndisintegrated. The condition of rocks with regard to the attraction\r\nof water, affects, in a different manner, the humidity of soil;\r\nfor, by this attraction, moisture may as well be abstracted from,\r\nas imparted to, the loose earth or soil by which rocks are covered.\r\nPart of the moisture which vegetable earth or soil derives from the\r\natmosphere passes into the subjacent mass of rock, but this may again\r\nbe compensated by evaporation; on which account the soil of such\r\nrocks as have but a small attraction for water usually dries up more\r\nreadily than soils whose solid substratum attracts and retains the\r\nmoisture in a greater degree.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the structure of rocks has also a greater, and\r\nnot less, diversified influence upon the humidity of productive\r\nsoil. Solid rocks, which are not traversed by numerous perpendicular\r\nfissures penetrating to a considerable depth, allow the water\r\nto remain in the soil; but columnar and schistose rocks, with\r\nperpendicular fissures, and strata declined from the horizontal\r\nposition, draw off the water from the soil covering their surface,\r\ninto lower places, where it often re-appears under the form of\r\nsprings. In these circumstances, we find a partial explanation of the\r\ngreat difference between the humidity of soil covering a surface of\r\nsolid granite, and that lying upon limestone, which is intersected\r\nby numerous fissures. Granitic mountains are often furnished with\r\nmarshes, whereas, on the other hand, the dryness of the soil upon\r\ncalcareous mountains is generally excessive[411], the cause of\r\nwhich phenomenon is, in a great measure, to be attributed to the\r\ncircumstances above mentioned. Columella observes, that silex having\r\na moderate covering of earth, preserves to the latter its humidity;\r\nand Palladius repeats the remark. In districts which consist of\r\nquartzose rocks, not less than of granitic ones, the surface is often\r\ncovered with marshes. Porphyritic rocks, on the contrary, which have\r\na remarkable segregation of parts, as well as columnar basalt, let\r\noff the water to lower places. Springs are very frequently found\r\nat the bottom of basaltic mountains; for the atmospheric waters\r\npenetrate by the perpendicular fissures to the strata on which the\r\nbasalt rests, and appear at the place where the two rocks meet.\r\n\r\nThe effect of different rocks upon the preservation and diminution\r\nof the moisture of fertile soil, influences vegetation in various\r\ndegrees. The retentive power of the surface of rocks is of the\r\ngreatest importance, where the soil consists chiefly of sand, through\r\nwhich the water percolates, and passes off entirely, unless it meets\r\nwith a stratum of such a nature, as to obstruct its passage, or comes\r\nupon a surface of solid rock. The cause of the sterility of sandy\r\nplains is not merely their sandy nature, but also the great depth\r\nof the mass or rock capable of retaining the water. The same sand,\r\nwhen covering mountains consisting of sandstone, has a much less\r\ndegree of sterility than in those plains, because the surface of the\r\nsubjacent rock impedes the progress of the water, and consequently\r\nretains it in the soil[412]. It has been sufficiently proved by\r\nexperiments, that plants can grow in pure sand, when furnished\r\nwith the necessary quantity of water. A subjacent rocky surface\r\nhas an entirely different effect upon soil which is very retentive\r\nof moisture, upon a clay soil for example, as, in that case, the\r\nhumidity is increased to a prejudicial degree. In land of this\r\nnature, a substratum of rock having the property of drawing off the\r\nwater would be useful.\r\n\r\nThe different conditions of rocks with regard to caloric, may have\r\nsome indirect influence upon the vigour of plants. Heat, whether\r\nimparted to the vegetable soil by the sun’s rays, or generated by\r\nvarious chemical processes in the earth itself, penetrates to the\r\nsurface of the subjacent rocks, and is more or less drawn from it in\r\na longer or shorter time. Columella observes, that rocks in the upper\r\npart of the soil are prejudicial to vines and trees, but in the lower\r\npart cool them. The heat of soil will be more or less drawn from it,\r\naccording to the greater or less conducting power of the subjacent\r\nrock. Compact crystalline rocks are probably better conductors of\r\ncaloric than those which are of looser texture; siliceous rocks than\r\nargillaceous and calcareous ones. The influence of the subjacent rock\r\nmust be greater in this respect, in proportion to the thinness of the\r\nsuperincumbent soil. The effect of the abduction of caloric is more\r\nparticularly sensible, where the roots of cultivated plants touch\r\nthe rock, a circumstance which we often see in vineyards. The vine\r\nfrequently thrives remarkably on the declivities of mountains, in\r\nwhich it sends its roots among fragments of stones. Experience shows,\r\nthat the quality of wine is influenced by the different conditions\r\nof the stones, among which vines are planted. Albertus Magnus has\r\nobserved, that the vine thrives well in earth which is mixed with\r\nfragments of black roofing slate; and Humboldt remarks, that the\r\nvines which grow upon the mountains of the valley of the Rhine,\r\nconsisting of black clay-slate, afford an excellent wine. At the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, also, the vine thrives well in a soil produced by the\r\ndecomposition of clay-slate, and mixed with fragments of it[413].\r\nIt is probable, that the adaptation of this sort of soil to the\r\ncultivation of the vine, depends upon its slow conducting power, and\r\nupon its rapidly imbibing the rays of the sun, on account of its dark\r\ncolour, and thus increasing the heat of the ground.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have only spoken of the _proximate_ influence of rocks\r\nupon plants; but it cannot be denied, that the _remote_ effects which\r\nthey produce, (inasmuch as vegetable soil is derived from them, and,\r\ntherefore, the qualities of this soil depend in a great measure upon\r\ntheir nature,) are of greater importance.\r\n\r\nIt is from the rocks which constitute the crust of the earth, that\r\nthe principal portion of productive soil is derived. Although other\r\nsubstances belonging to the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are\r\nnecessary for the nourishment of plants, a soil consisting chiefly\r\nof inorganic particles is still more necessary, both for sustaining\r\ntheir roots, and for receiving, retaining, and partly also preparing\r\nnutrition for them; for, according to accurate observations, some\r\ninorganic substances exert an influence upon the decomposition of\r\nanimal and vegetable remains. These effects vary much according to\r\ndifferences in the aggregation and chemical nature of the inorganic\r\nparts; of which circumstances, however, the different qualities of\r\nrocks are the ultimate cause.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of productive soil may be distinguished with regard to\r\ntheir origin. The soil has either originated in the place in which\r\nit now is from the subjacent rock, or it has been transported to the\r\nplaces in which it is now found by some power, especially by that\r\nof water. The first kind may be named _untransported_, the second\r\n_transported soil_. To the first kind of soil is to be referred a\r\ngreat part of the soil which covers the summits and declivities of\r\nmountains, and to the other, the soil which fills the bottoms of\r\nvalleys, as well as a great part of the loose soil of extensive\r\nstrata in hilly countries and plains. Untransported soil is generally\r\nthinner than the transported; and of the two the latter is that which\r\nmost frequently occurs in low land. The first kind of soil, the\r\nuntransported, is found to be more or less similar, in its principal\r\nconstituent parts, to the rocks from which it has originated; in the\r\nother kind, the transported soil, on the contrary, the parts which\r\nwere originally in connection, have been variously separated and\r\nmixed, by the agency of the powers by which its transportation was\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nThe quantity and quality of the soil derived from the disintegration\r\nof rocks, must depend upon the nature of these rocks; its quality\r\nbeing determined by the constituent parts of the rock from which it\r\noriginated, and its quantity being proportioned to the greater or\r\nless degree in which the rock may resist decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of rocks, and their conversion into loose earth,\r\nare partly _mechanical_, and partly _chemical_. The principal\r\nmechanical powers, by which disintegration is effected, are, _1st_,\r\nThe weight of the loosened parts; _2d_, Water, not merely in its\r\nliquid and mobile state, but also, and that chiefly, in the state\r\nof ice; _3d_, The roots of vegetables in general, and especially of\r\ntrees. These powers usually act more or less in conjunction, and the\r\neffects produced by this union are in many cases almost incredible.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of rocks commences in those parts where the\r\npower of cohesion is least energetic. Rents take place owing to the\r\nunequal attraction of parts, and also in the direction of planes,\r\nin which heterogeneous parts are in contact; and in this manner\r\nthe original structure of rocks determines the first steps of\r\ntheir disintegration. Water, which enters into the minute fissures\r\nof rocks, by the power of capillary attraction, is expanded by\r\ncongelation, and thus overcomes the cohesion of parts, and produces\r\nrents. The roots of trees acting as wedges, produce the same\r\neffect in a wonderful degree, a phenomenon which has been so well\r\nillustrated by Annæus Seneca, in his Natural Questions. “Let us\r\nconsider,” says he, “how great a power is exerted by the most minute\r\nseeds, which, although at first small as they are, can scarcely\r\nfind a place in the crevices of rocks, yet at length grow to such\r\na size as to rend asunder vast rocks, overturning crags and cliffs,\r\nby the power of their very minute and delicate roots.” The parts\r\nof rocks loosened by these powers, are entirely separated, and are\r\ncarried to a great or less distance, by streams of water, and in\r\nthe higher regions, by the power of winds. In cliffs and precipices\r\nwhich have been formed by the splitting of masses of rock, effected\r\nin the manner above described, the loosened parts often lose their\r\nstability; and, following the direction of gravity, fall to the\r\nground, an effect which has also been described by Seneca in another\r\nplace. “Nor is it alone probable,” says he, “that rocks are split\r\nasunder by their mere weight, but also when streams of water are\r\ncarried over them, the continual moisture works into the joinings of\r\nthe rock, and daily takes away a portion of the connecting matter,\r\nand, if I may so speak, abrades the skin by which it is contained.\r\nAt length, in the course of ages, this gradual detrition so much\r\ndiminishes the supporting parts, that they can no longer sustain the\r\nweight. Then masses of vast size fall down, and the rock tumbling\r\nfrom its ancient seat, overwhelms whatever lies below.” The cohesion\r\nof some rocks, especially argillaceous ones, is so slight, and their\r\nporosity so great, that their smallest parts imbibe water, and are\r\nsensibly softened by it, an effect which is much assisted by the\r\nfreezing of the water. This mechanical change is experienced by the\r\ndifferent varieties of common clay, slate-clay, and some other rocks.\r\n\r\n_Chemical_ powers often act in conjunction with mechanical ones, in\r\nbreaking down rocks, the former, the chemical, frequently finishing\r\nwhat had been begun by the latter. Mechanical powers only changing\r\nthe _aggregation_ of rocks, may break down their parts to a certain\r\nsize, according to their different nature; chemical powers, again,\r\nwhich change the _nature_ of substances, destroy the connection of\r\nthe minute parts of rocks. When chemical is preceded by mechanical\r\naction, it is much assisted by it. The latter has a much more general\r\neffect, as all rocks are subjected to its influence; chemical\r\ndecomposition, on the other hand, acts only upon some rocks, and in\r\nthese only upon certain parts. The chemical decomposition of rocks is\r\nchiefly effected by the oxygen of atmospheric air and of water; but\r\nwe are also persuaded, that certain cryptogamic plants, intimately\r\nattached to the surface of stones, Lichens namely, assist in their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen of air and water can only affect the constituent parts\r\nof rocks, which have a great affinity to it, such as the iron and\r\nsulphur forming pyrites, oxydulous iron, oxydulous manganese, or\r\nthe same substances mixed with earth or carbonic acid, charcoal and\r\nbitumen. Very solid and compact masses of rock, such as greenstone,\r\nwhich are not easily affected by other means, are sometimes corroded\r\nby the chemical change of the pyrites contained in them, by which\r\nit is converted into a hydrate of iron[414]. In certain other\r\nrocks, which are also readily broken down by mechanical agents,\r\nclay-slate for instance, the disintegration is much accelerated by\r\nthe decomposition of the pyrites. The oxydulous iron of felspar is\r\ncommonly converted by decomposition into a hydrate or ochre. The\r\ncarbonate of iron, as well as of manganese, which sometimes occur\r\nin rocks, in limestone rock for example, are deprived of carbonic\r\nacid by the oxidation of their bases. Charcoal and bitumen, which\r\nare sometimes contained in rocks, limestone and argillaceous ones\r\nfor example, are dissipated by the contact of air, so that rocks\r\nwhich were originally of a dark colour, lose it, and become whitish.\r\nWater, as a chemical agent, contributes so much to the decomposition\r\nof certain rocks, that, either in a pure state, or in combination\r\nwith carbonic acid, it dissolves their parts, of which gypsum and\r\nlimestone afford examples. In certain other minerals, in felspar\r\nfor instance, a separation of the constituent parts, produced by\r\nthe contact of air and water, is observed, the proximate cause of\r\nwhich has not hitherto been discovered. The mass is decomposed, its\r\nlamellar structure is converted into an earthy nature, the alkali\r\ncontained in the felspar is extracted by the water, a mineral is\r\nproduced, to which the Chinese have given the name of _Kaolin_, and\r\nwhich is adapted for the manufacture of porcelain. Granite and gneiss\r\noccur in some districts, the felspar of which is decomposed in this\r\nmanner through the whole mass,--a circumstance which must be of great\r\nimportance in regard to the formation of productive soil.\r\n\r\nCryptogamic plants covering the surface of rocks, and thriving well\r\nin this situation, where more perfect vegetables could not grow,\r\nseem also destined to promote the chemical decomposition of rocks,\r\nan effect which they produce both directly and indirectly. As they\r\nimbibe the water of the atmosphere, and retain it like a sponge,\r\nthey keep up a constant application of this substance to the rock,\r\nand in this manner contribute indirectly to its decomposition. There\r\nare some cryptogamic plants also, which consume certain portions of\r\nthe rocks with which they are in contact, corrode their surface, and\r\ndestroy the cohesion of its parts, effects which may chiefly be seen\r\nin certain cryptogamic plants attached to calcareous rocks. In this\r\nmanner one sort of vegetation prepares a place for another, and the\r\nmost imperfect vegetables are subservient to the growth of the more\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nAfter premising thus much, we shall now proceed to the examination\r\nof the principal rocks, in so far as regards their connection with\r\nthe formation of productive soil, beginning with those which resist\r\ndecomposition in the highest degree, and ending with those which are\r\nthe most conducive to the formation of loose earth and soil.\r\n\r\nIn the first class, we place those rocks which experience no\r\nchemical decomposition, in so far as regards their principal mass,\r\nand whose cohesion of parts is so great that mechanical powers can\r\nonly open their natural fissures to a greater extent, and thus break\r\nthem down into fragments. Of this kind are _vitreous lava_, _pure\r\nquartz_, _compact quartz_, _flinty slate_, and _porphyry with a\r\nsiliceous basis_. On mountains consisting of these rocks, scarcely\r\nany productive soil is found, and frequently none at all. They are\r\nusually characterized by sterile rocks and cliffs, the bases of which\r\nare covered with innumerable rough fragments of stones, retaining\r\ntheir sharp edges for a great length of time, the heaps of which\r\nseldom produce any thing else than mosses, which frequently cover the\r\ninterstices of fragments, occasionally a few grasses, and sometimes\r\na solitary shrub or tree. Examples, Bennevis, Paps of Jura, and\r\nMorven Hills. Of all rocks, vitreous volcanic productions are the\r\nleast capable of contributing to the formation of productive soil.\r\nTheir dark coloured tracts descend from volcanic mountains to the\r\nvalleys in frightful sterility, the chinks of their rugged masses\r\nscarcely affording sufficient water for the roots of mosses[415].\r\nTo the second class we refer _compact limestone_, a rock which\r\ncontributes extensively to the formation of the solid crust of\r\nthe globe. In so far as regards its principal constituent parts,\r\nit is not affected by atmospheric water or air; but, as its parts\r\nhave but comparatively little cohesion, and are usually separated\r\nin a considerable degree by minute fissures, they are more liable\r\nto be broken down and crumbled by mechanical powers, than those\r\nof the rocks belonging to the first class. In districts where the\r\nfundamental rock is limestone, the layers of loose original soil\r\nor subsoil are thin, and filled with numerous fragments. As the\r\nsoil arising from the disintegration of limestone contains a great\r\nproportion of calcareous matter, it is neither favourable to the\r\ngrowth of plants in general, nor to that of the greater number of\r\nvegetables which are the object of cultivation. Soil of this kind\r\nis too hot, dry and stony; hence the reason why districts, in which\r\npure limestone rocks predominate, are often sterile. The case is\r\ndifferent, however, where a portion of clay enters as an ingredient\r\ninto the composition of calcareous rocks, for here the soil is\r\nusually very productive; or, where rocks of a different nature\r\nalternate with masses of pure limestone, having a greater capability\r\nthan it of contributing to the formation of productive soil. When\r\nwater, containing carbonic acid, passes through limestone rocks, it\r\ndissolves portions of it, and deposits them in other places, by which\r\nthe decomposition of the limestone and the formation of loose earth\r\nmay be in some measure accelerated.\r\n\r\nTo the third class belong _chalk_ and _gypsum_; which, in so far\r\nas regards their decomposition by chemical means, are of a similar\r\nnature with compact limestone; but possessing a much slighter\r\ncohesion of parts, are more liable to be broken down by mechanical\r\nmeans. Water also dissolves gypsum, and thus assists in its\r\ndisintegration. The soil arising from these rocks resembles that\r\nproduced by compact limestone, which explains the want of fertility,\r\nobservable in certain gypseous tracts of the North of Germany, and in\r\nthe chalk districts of France. The fertility which we see in certain\r\nplaces where chalk is the fundamental rock, as in the Isle of Wight,\r\nIsland of Rugen, &c. is to be attributed as well to argillaceous and\r\nmarly strata alternating with the chalk, as to the greater humidity\r\nof the atmosphere, by which the dryness and heat of the soil are\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth class we place certain rocks, composed of different\r\nminerals, but compact in appearance, which, although they resist\r\nmechanical disintegration, are yet subject to chemical action, and\r\nare, by means of it, converted into a loose, compound productive\r\nsoil. Of this kind are _basalt_, and some other rocks very nearly\r\nallied to it.\r\n\r\nTo the fifth class we refer those rocks which have a crystalline,\r\ngranular, or slaty texture. The mutual adhesion of the heterogeneous\r\nparts, of which they consist, being, in general, inconsiderable,\r\nthey are easily broken down by mechanical means, and thus contribute\r\nin a high degree to the formation of productive soil. The felspar\r\ncontained in these rocks, on account of the chemical decomposition\r\nwhich it readily undergoes, has a great effect not only upon the\r\nquantity, but also the fertility of the soil produced. The quartz,\r\non the contrary, as well as the mica and hornblende, long resist\r\nchemical decomposition; they are, however, useful in this respect,\r\nthat the argillaceous soil arising from the felspar, has its\r\ntenacity diminished; and is consequently rendered better adapted for\r\nvegetation, by being intermixed with them. _Granite_ and _gneiss_,\r\nof all truly granular crystalline rocks, afford the deepest and\r\nmost fertile soil, aptly compounded of different substances,\r\nsufficiently loose in its aggregation, and capable of retaining the\r\nnecessary moisture. Soil arising from the disintegration of granite\r\nis unfavourable to vegetation only, where the rock abounds much in\r\nquartz, and where the superfluous water cannot run off, and so gives\r\nrise to marshes, which produce only vegetables of inferior quality;\r\nof which we have examples in the granite districts of Aberdeen. In\r\nsuch places as these, peat is easily generated, which, although of\r\ngreat use, is yet much less advantageous than wood. _Syenite_, which\r\nabounds much in hornblende, is inferior to granite, with respect to\r\nthe production of fertile soil; and primitive _greenstone_, which\r\nresists disintegration and decomposition in the highest degree,\r\noccupies the last place in this class. In the series of slaty\r\ncrystalline rocks, _mica-slate_ is next to gneiss: but on account of\r\nthe small proportion of felspar which enters into its composition,\r\nit does not afford so productive a soil.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth class may be placed the slaty rocks, whether simple,\r\nor intimately compounded, which do not readily undergo chemical\r\ndecomposition, but which easily separate at their natural fissures,\r\nand are mechanically resolved into an earthy mass, forming a paste\r\nwith water, circumstances which are observed chiefly in _clay-slate_,\r\na rock of much importance in the formation of productive soil,\r\nusually passing into a clayey sort of earth.\r\n\r\nTo the seventh class belong the conglomerated rocks, whose parts\r\nindeed undergo very little, if any, chemical change, but are easily\r\nseparated by mechanical means, and are thus converted into a\r\ngravelly, sandy, or earthy mass. Of this kind are _greywacke_, _old\r\nred sandstone_, and sandstones of various kinds. Much diversity is\r\nexhibited by these rocks, with regard to the facility with which they\r\nundergo disintegration, as well as the nature of the soil arising\r\nfrom them; circumstances which chiefly depend upon the nature of the\r\ncement, and its relation to the parts cemented. The disintegration of\r\nthese rocks is the more easily effected that the cement is abundant,\r\nand less intimately connected with the other parts, that is, the more\r\nthey depart from a crystalline nature; on which account greywacke\r\nis less easily converted into soil, than the common varieties of\r\nsandstone. By the decomposition of greywacke, a loose and fertile\r\nsoil is formed, containing particles of quartz and clay in due\r\nproportion; on the other hand, by the decomposition of red sandstone,\r\na soil is frequently produced, abounding in argillaceous particles\r\nimpregnated with iron, and therefore stiff and cold. The _variegated\r\nsandstone_, with a marly cement, not unfrequently affords a pretty\r\nfertile soil; the _quadersandstein_, on the contrary, commonly\r\npresents a sandy and arid soil.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the eighth class we shall place those rocks, whether\r\nsimple or intimately compounded, whose nature is so loose, or whose\r\nparts are so separated, that they fall with great facility into an\r\nearthy mass, and are also in part mechanically reduced by water. To\r\nthis class belong the different varieties of _marl_, _slate-clay_,\r\n_basaltic_ and _volcanic tuffa_. These rocks, many of which are\r\nextensively diffused, are of much importance in the formation of\r\nproductive soil, although the quality of the earth produced by them\r\nvaries much, according to their different natures. Slate-clay affords\r\nan argillaceous soil; in earth produced by the decomposition of marl,\r\nthe clay is diminished in proportion to the greater abundance of the\r\ncalcareous or sandy parts; while a mixed and very fertile soil is\r\nusually generated from basaltic and volcanic tufas.\r\n\r\nThe various relations which exist in the stratification and position\r\nof rocks, have much influence in producing a diversity in the\r\nsoil formed immediately from their decomposition. This diversity\r\ncannot be so great when different rocks of various ages occur in a\r\ndeterminate order in horizontal strata; in which case, the uppermost\r\nbed may exhibit a great extent of surface of the same nature. When,\r\non the other hand, strata of rocks of different natures, forms,\r\nand dimensions, placed at different angles of inclination, and\r\nin different directions, appear at the surface, it will easily\r\nbe understood how it may happen that the soil produced by their\r\ndecomposition may occur of very different qualities, in places\r\nnot very distant from each other. The manner in which the soil is\r\ninfluenced by a difference in the arrangement and position of the\r\nstrata, will become evident, on comparing districts in which one\r\nparticular sort of rock lies beneath the surface in horizontal\r\nstrata, with others in which the solid substratum is composed of\r\nvarious rocks differing in their inclination towards the horizon.\r\nIn districts of the former kind, the qualities of the soil vary\r\nin general but little; in such as are of the latter kind, on the\r\ncontrary, they are often found extremely different. The great\r\ndiversity of soil seen in England, as well as in Germany, may,\r\nin fact, be partly explained by the circumstance, that, in those\r\ncountries, the nature and position of the strata vary every where.\r\nOn the other hand, the great similarity which pervades the soil of\r\nSouthern Russia, is without doubt produced by a uniformity in the\r\nposition and inclination of the limestone which lies immediately\r\nunder the soil.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the principal mass of the strata usually exerts a\r\ngreat degree of influence over the qualities of the soil. When the\r\nsolid substratum is sandstone, its effect upon the soil is, in\r\ngeneral, as evidently seen, though not perhaps in an equal degree,\r\nas when it is marl. Exceptions, however, to this rule sometimes\r\noccur; as, for instance, when the principal mass of a rock which\r\nresists disintegration in a high degree contains beds that are\r\neasily reduced to earth. This is the case with the shell-limestone\r\n(muschelkalkstein) of Germany, the mountains of which are not\r\nunfrequently covered with a clayey soil, which has not been produced\r\nby the decomposition of the principal strata themselves, but by that\r\nof the slate-clay and argillaceous marl alternating with them.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered untransported soil, or that produced\r\nfrom the disintegration or decomposition of the subjacent rocks in\r\nthe places where it occurs; we have now to examine the relations\r\nwhich exist between the subjacent rock, and the _transported soil_\r\nlying upon it. The nature of the rock does not indeed influence,\r\nexcepting in a more remote degree, the transported soil, which has\r\nbeen carried to a greater or less distance from the places of its\r\nproduction, by the agency of moving powers, and again deposited of\r\nvarious forms and compositions. However, it may often be plainly\r\nseen, that the materials of this soil have been derived from\r\nparticular rocks, and that these rocks have exerted some degree of\r\ninfluence over the formation and distribution of the transported\r\nsoil. The examination of these relations is of great importance,\r\nbecause it is with secondary or transported soil that agriculture\r\nis principally concerned. The varieties of transported soil depend\r\nchiefly upon three circumstances: _1st_, The nature of the rocks from\r\nwhich they are derived; _2dly_, The quality and effect of the moving\r\npowers; _3dly_, The changes which they may have undergone after their\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the materials which enter into the composition of\r\ntransported soil, has been already considered. From their difference\r\nmay be easily explained why soil generated from the debris of\r\nprimitive crystalline rocks has different qualities from soil which\r\nhas been derived from strata of sandstone or marl.\r\n\r\nThe principal powers which contribute to the transportation of soil,\r\nare, The weight of loose masses, ice, and water. The weight of loose\r\nmasses is a cause of transportation which we frequently see in\r\noperation. By it the huge cones of debris at the base and upon the\r\ndeclivities of precipices and mountains, are gradually carried off\r\ntoward the bottom of the valleys; a phenomenon which can scarcely any\r\nwhere be better seen than in the valleys of the Alps, where mountains\r\nsometimes occur evidently consisting of debris, and clothed with\r\ntrees and shrubs, or covered with pastures, the masses of which are\r\ngradually moved, as upon inclined planes, by the action of the water\r\nwhich percolates through them.\r\n\r\nIce effects the transportation of rocks and debris, with a power\r\nwhich nothing can resist. This is no where more conspicuous than\r\namong the glaciers of the Alps, by the falling of which great heaps\r\nof stones and rubbish are produced. The transportation of large\r\nstones by means of ice may also be seen in our mountain torrents in\r\nwinter. Huge masses of stone, scattered over the plains of the north\r\nof Germany and the islands of Denmark, and often very prejudicial to\r\nagriculture, whose northern origin appears to be established, may\r\nhave been carried by the same powerful agent from Finland, Sweden and\r\nNorway, into those countries, at a time when the plains of northern\r\nGermany, with the other flat districts along the shores of the\r\nBaltic, were still covered by the waves of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of transported soil, water usually exerts a great\r\ndegree of power. By means of it, not only are vast masses transported\r\nto the greatest distances, but their parts are at the same time\r\ncrumbled down and mingled together. To these operations are to be\r\nattributed the various terminations of different soils at horizontal\r\ndistances, as well as the different alternations of their strata at\r\nvertical ones. The power of water in the formation of transported\r\nsoil varies, not only according to the different inclinations of its\r\nchannel, but also in regard to the form, size, and weight of the\r\nparts carried off by it; for which reason, in the formation of such\r\nsoils, the same phenomena take place on a large scale, that we see\r\non a smaller, in performing the operations of breaking and washing\r\nthe ores of metals. For the same reason that, in these processes,\r\nthe larger particles subside, while the smaller are propelled, from\r\nwhich again the heavier particles of ore are sooner deposited than\r\nthe lighter; in plains in the vicinity of a mountain, covered with\r\ntransported soil, stones and debris are usually seen first, then\r\nearth, clay, and sand mixed together, and farther on, finer sand,\r\nwith strata of clay.\r\n\r\nTransported or secondary soil, produced by water, according to the\r\nmode of its formation, is divided into four classes, viz.--1. Soil of\r\nValleys; 2. River Soil; 3. Lake Soil; 4. Marine Soil.\r\n\r\n1. _Soil of Valleys._--It is washed down by rain and snow water,\r\nand partly also produced by rivulets, which carry off the loose\r\nparts from the declivities of mountains to the plains. The nature of\r\nthis soil in general clearly shews the nearness of its origin. Its\r\ndepth is always greatest in the bottom of the valley, and gradually\r\ndiminishes toward the declivities of the mountains. The curvature\r\nof the different strata is usually accommodated to the irregularity\r\nof its external form, so that when a section is made of them, they\r\nexhibit a series of parallel curved lines.\r\n\r\n2. _River Soil_, or the soil found in the beds and banks of rivers,\r\nand which is produced by the continual propelling power of large\r\nrivers. To this class belong two different kinds; _1st_, Soil\r\ncontaining pebbles of various sizes, produced by the power of\r\ntorrents in the vicinity of mountains; and, _2d_, Earth or mud,\r\ndeposited in the beds of rivers, in places at a distance from\r\nmountains. A peculiarity of river soil in general is, that it is much\r\nextended in length, while its breadth is comparatively but small.\r\nThe different layers have neither so much irregularity as in the\r\npreceding kind, nor are they so precise in arrangement as in the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n3. _Lake Soil_, deposited at the bottom of still water. To this class\r\nis to be referred the soil in the bottoms of valleys, which had\r\nformerly been lakes, either separate or connected with rivers. The\r\nhorizontal dimensions of this kind of soil are often more or less\r\nequal. Sometimes, indeed, the length is greater than the breadth;\r\nnot, however, in the same degree as in soil deposited in the bed\r\nof rivers. The surface is usually plane, and the different strata\r\nalternate in a parallel manner.\r\n\r\n4. _Marine Soil_, that is to say, the mud of the ancient ocean.\r\nIt is the greatest of all in its extent, both in a horizontal and\r\na vertical direction. Its surface is more or less undulated, very\r\nseldom even. Its masses are both very thick and very uniform in\r\ncomposition. Different and alternating strata, however, do occur,\r\nwhose forms and dimensions are usually more or less regular, and\r\nwhich are not unfrequently undulated.\r\n\r\nSoil, after being formed, is acted upon by natural powers in various\r\nways. The atmosphere is perpetually modifying it; rivers, waves, and\r\nwinds, act here and there upon its surface, and alter its external\r\nform; water introduces into it the substances which it holds in\r\nsolution. The different constituent parts of soil act upon each\r\nother chemically, and in this manner new decompositions and mixtures\r\nare produced; and this chemical change is increased by the action\r\nof vegetables, as well as of bodies deriving their origin from both\r\norganic kingdoms.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the relations existing between the\r\nmasses of which the solid crust of the globe is composed, and the\r\nloose earth or soil by which it is covered, it appears evident\r\nenough (Hausmann concludes) that they have great influence over its\r\nformation and nature, and therefore upon the more perfect vegetables,\r\nand especially those which are the objects of cultivation; and\r\nthat although the fertility of the soil is much increased by these\r\nvegetables themselves, yet the first foundation of their vigour is\r\nderived from the disintegration and decomposition of rocks. If this\r\nbe correct, the constitution of the solid crust of the earth has a\r\nmuch more extended influence. For, by preparing a habitation for the\r\ngreater and most important parts of plants, it also exerts a high\r\ndegree of influence upon the animals which derive their sustenance\r\nfrom them, and, at the same time, affords the means of subsistence to\r\nman[416].\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE IRISH ELK, FOSSIL ELEPHANT OR MAMMOTH, AND THE\r\nMASTODON.\r\n\r\nAs the Irish Elk, the Fossil Elephant or Mammoth, and the Mastodon,\r\nare among the most remarkable of the fossil and extinct species of\r\nquadrupeds mentioned in the preceding pages of this work, we, with\r\nthe view of farther gratifying the curiosity of our readers, now lay\r\nbefore them the following additional details from the writings of\r\nCuvier, Goldfuss, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Fossil Elk of Ireland_, Cervus megaceros[417].\r\n\r\n(_Noticed at_ p. 286.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most magnificent of the bisulcated animals met with in\r\na fossil state in the British Islands is the Elk of Ireland, the\r\n_Cervus megaceros_. Bones and horns of vast size of this species are\r\nalmost daily dug out of the bogs and marl pits of Ireland. Similar\r\nremains have been met with in alluvial strata in Britain, and also in\r\nthe Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n“So frequently do these remains,” Mr Hart remarks, “occur in most\r\nparts of Ireland, that there are very few of the peasantry who are\r\nnot, either from personal observation or report, acquainted with\r\nthem by the familiar name of the horns of the ‘old deer.’ Indeed in\r\nsome parts of the country they have been found so often, that far\r\nfrom being regarded as objects of any extraordinary interest, they\r\nhave been either thrown aside as lumber, or applied to the commonest\r\neconomical uses[418].\r\n\r\n“I have made diligent but fruitless search for an account of the\r\nparticular time when any of these remains were first discovered. As\r\nthey generally occur in marl, it is most likely that they did not\r\nbegin to attract attention until the advanced state of agriculture\r\nhad created an increased demand for that mineral as a manure. We can\r\nvery easily imagine the astonishment which the appearance of horns so\r\nlarge, and of such strange form, must have excited in the minds of\r\nthose who discovered them for the first time, and how readily they\r\nobtained a place in the hall of some adjoining mansion, where they\r\nwere deposited as an ornament of great curiosity, from the contrast\r\nwhich they formed with the horns of the species of deer known at\r\npresent. In this way we may account for the preservation of so many\r\nspecimens as are found in the possession of the gentry in different\r\nparts of this country.\r\n\r\n“Very lately an entire skeleton of the Irish Elk was dug up in that\r\ncountry. The following statement of the circumstances under which\r\nthe bones were found, with their geological position, was laid before\r\nthe Dublin Society, in a letter from Archdean Maunsell to the Right\r\nHon. George Knox.\r\n\r\n  “_Middleton Lodge, March 8. 1825._\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n  “I deferred replying to your letter of the 1st, as it was my\r\n  intention to proceed to Limerick in a few days, and I was anxious\r\n  to look over some notes I had taken, and which I left there, of\r\n  the circumstances connected with the discovery of the fossil\r\n  remains which the Royal Dublin Society have received. As I have,\r\n  however, been obliged to postpone my departure for several days,\r\n  I can no longer defer offering my best thanks for the kind manner\r\n  in which you have received the conjectures which I formed upon a\r\n  subject to which my attention was directed, by having fortunately\r\n  been present before the bones were disturbed from the situation in\r\n  which they had lain during a period which I apprehend it would not\r\n  be easy to define. I am sensible that any consideration which may\r\n  have been attached to my observations should be attributed to the\r\n  interest which the subject itself is calculated to excite, rather\r\n  than to any ability of mine to do it justice. The opinion which\r\n  I took the liberty of communicating to you was formed after some\r\n  consideration, and although I had not the most remote idea of its\r\n  being worthy of any attention, I can have no objection to your\r\n  making any use of it which you may conceive expedient. There is, I\r\n  conceive, much interesting material for speculation, resulting from\r\n  the discovery of these fossil remains, and the first that naturally\r\n  occurs is the manner in which the animals were destroyed, and\r\n  the bones so singularly preserved. I stated, in the hasty sketch\r\n  which I gave you of my theory upon this point, that I apprehended\r\n  they must have been destroyed by some overwhelming deluge, that\r\n  they were probably drowned upon the hills where they had taken\r\n  refuge, as the waters rose, and that, as they subsided, they were\r\n  drawn from thence into the valley in which they were found; that\r\n  the agitation of the waters had occasioned such a dispersion of\r\n  the bones, when the ligaments dissolved, as would account for\r\n  their having been scattered in the way in which they were found,\r\n  and that the deposite of shell marl, with which I supposed the\r\n  water to have been turbid, had so completely protected them from\r\n  atmospheric influence as to prevent their subsequent decomposition.\r\n  To enable you to form some estimate of the reasonableness of this\r\n  supposition, it is necessary that I should endeavour to explain the\r\n  situation, &c. of the valley and the adjoining hills. The valley\r\n  in which the remains were found contains about twenty plantation\r\n  acres, and the soil consists of a stratum of peat about a foot\r\n  thick, immediately under this a stratum of shell-marl, varying\r\n  from 1½ to 2½ feet in thickness; in this many of the shells retain\r\n  their original colour and figure, and are not marine; under the\r\n  marl there is a bed of light blue clay; through this one of my\r\n  workmen drove an iron rod, in several places, twelve feet deep,\r\n  without meeting opposition. Most of the bones and heads, eight in\r\n  number, were found in the marl; many of them, however, appeared to\r\n  rest on the clay, and to be merely covered by the marl. The remains\r\n  were disposed in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of\r\n  ascertaining the exact component parts of each skeleton; in some\r\n  places portions were found removed many yards from others, and in\r\n  no instance were two bones found lying close to each other. Their\r\n  position also was singular; in one place two heads were found, with\r\n  the antlers entwined in each other, and immediately under them a\r\n  large blade-bone; in another, a very large head was discovered, and\r\n  although a most diligent search was made, no part of the skeleton\r\n  found; within some hundred yards, in another, the jaw-bones were\r\n  found, and not the head. The conclusion which, I conceive, may\r\n  fairly be deduced from such a position of the various parts of\r\n  the animals is, that there must have been some powerful agent\r\n  employed in dispersing them after their death; and as I consider\r\n  it impossible that their own gravity could have been sufficient to\r\n  sink them through the various strata, I conceive these must have\r\n  originated subsequently to the dispersion of the bones. I also\r\n  think, that, if they had been exposed for any time to atmospheric\r\n  influence, they never could have been preserved in their present\r\n  extraordinary perfection.\r\n\r\n  “The hills immediately adjoining this valley are composed of\r\n  limestone, with a covering of rich mould of various degrees of\r\n  thickness. One of them, whose base is about thirty acres, rises\r\n  directly from the edge of the valley, with sides very precipitous,\r\n  and in one place perfectly perpendicular, of naked limestone. In\r\n  every part of this hill the superficies comprises as much stone as\r\n  mould; on the side nearly opposite, the hill is equally high, but\r\n  the sides not so steep, and the covering of mould thicker; on the\r\n  other sides the ground only rises in some degree (twenty or thirty\r\n  feet perhaps), and consists of a thin mould, and immediately under\r\n  a _very hard_ limestone gravel. Indeed, except where limestone\r\n  forms the substratum, this is the character of all the soil in the\r\n  vicinity except the Corkasses, which are evidently alluvial. I am\r\n  fully aware, that, assuming the destruction of the animals to have\r\n  been occasioned by a flood, they would naturally have retreated\r\n  from the water to the hills, and that, as they probably met their\r\n  fate there, their remains should have been discovered on the summit\r\n  of the hills, and not in the valley, particularly as one of them\r\n  is perfectly flat on the top, which contains six or seven acres. I\r\n  apprehend that the remains of many of them were deposited on the\r\n  tops of the hills; but as they have _now_ only a slight covering\r\n  of mould, not sufficient to cover a small dog, they were formerly\r\n  perfectly bare; and as they were thus devoid of the means of\r\n  protecting the remains from the atmosphere, whatever was left there\r\n  soon became decomposed, and resolved into portions of the mould,\r\n  which is now to be found on the hills. This remark I conceive also\r\n  to be applicable to the soil with the substratum of limestone\r\n  gravel, which affords quite as little material for preserving the\r\n  bones as the hills do.\r\n\r\n  “It is material that I should observe, that of eight heads which\r\n  we found, none were without antlers; the variety in character also\r\n  was such as to induce me to imagine, that possibly the females were\r\n  not devoid of these appendages. Unfortunately, however, from the\r\n  difficulty of raising them, being saturated with water, and as soft\r\n  as wet brown paper, only three were at all perfect.\r\n\r\n  “Having now disposed of these antediluvians, a question naturally\r\n  arises, how it happens that the fossil remains of no other animals\r\n  were found, when the same fate probably overwhelmed every existing\r\n  creature? Could deer have been the only living beings at that\r\n  period? Was Ireland part of a great continent when this catastrophe\r\n  occurred, and were these unfortunates the first emigrants to our\r\n  Isle from that great centre from whence the globe was supplied with\r\n  occupants, and did they perish before other animals less influenced\r\n  by enterprise, and less endowed with physical strength, could have\r\n  followed their example? These problems I confess myself unable to\r\n  solve, and shall not presume to obtrude my many reveries upon this\r\n  and other points, which have originated in the discovery of a few\r\n  bones, upon those who I know are so much better competent to form a\r\n  sound opinion. I shall, I hope, be able to send the antlers, which\r\n  are very fine, on the 15th of this month.\r\n\r\n  “If you have a desire to make any use of this letter, I can only\r\n  say I have no objection. I remain, dear Sir, with feelings of great\r\n  respect,\r\n\r\n      “Yours most truly,\r\n\r\n      “WILLIAM W. MAUNSELL.”\r\n\r\nOf this skeleton, the most perfect hitherto found, the following\r\ninteresting description is given by Mr Hart, in his memoir.\r\n\r\n  “This magnificent skeleton is perfect in every single bone of the\r\n  framework which contributes to form a part of its general outline:\r\n  the spine, the chest, the pelvis, and the extremities, are all\r\n  complete in this respect; and, when surmounted by the head, and\r\n  beautifully expanded antlers, which extend out to a distance of\r\n  nearly six feet on either side, forms a splendid display of the\r\n  reliques of the former grandeur of the animal kingdom, and carries\r\n  back the imagination to a period when whole herds of this noble\r\n  animal wandered at large over the face of the country.\r\n\r\n  To proceed with a description of the several parts of this specimen\r\n  in detail, I shall commence with the horns, which give the animal\r\n  its chief characteristic feature.\r\n\r\n  _The horns._--That the description of these may be the more\r\n  intelligible, I will first explain the terms which I mean to apply\r\n  to their several parts. Each horn consists of the socket or root,\r\n  the burr or coronary circle, the beam or shaft, the palm and the\r\n  antlers.\r\n\r\n  The socket or root is the part of the horn which grows out of\r\n  the frontal bone, and which is never shed; it is smooth, of a\r\n  brown colour, an inch and half in length, and eleven inches three\r\n  quarters in circumference; in the animal’s lifetime it was covered\r\n  by the skin. The coronary or bead-like circle, or burr, is a ring\r\n  of small, hard, whitish prominences, resembling a string of pearls,\r\n  which encircles the junction of the socket with the part of the\r\n  horn which falls annually from the heads of all deer.\r\n\r\n  The beam or shaft extends outwards, with a curvature whose\r\n  concavity looks downwards, and backwards. This part is nearly\r\n  cylindrical at its root, and its length equals about one-fourth of\r\n  that of the whole horn; its outer end is spread out and flattened\r\n  on its upper surface, and is continuous with the palm, which\r\n  expands outwards in a fan-like form, the outer extremity of which\r\n  measures two feet ten inches across, being its broadest part.\r\n  Where the beam joins the palm the horn undergoes a kind of twist,\r\n  the effect of which on the palm is, to place its edges above and\r\n  below, and its surfaces anterior and posterior; the anterior\r\n  surface is convex, and looks outwards; the posterior is concave,\r\n  and its surface looks towards that of the opposite palm. Such is\r\n  the position of the horns, when the head is so placed that the\r\n  zygomatic arch is parallel to the horizon, as it would be during\r\n  progression, or whilst the animal stands in an easy posture.\r\n\r\n  The antlers are the long pointed processes which project from\r\n  the horns, two of which grow from the beam anteriorly; the first\r\n  comes off immediately from the root, and is directed downwards,\r\n  overhanging the orbit; this is called the brow antler, which, in\r\n  this specimen, is divided into two points at its extremity[419].\r\n\r\n  The other antler, which comes off from the beam, we may call the\r\n  sur-antler: in this specimen it consists of a broad plate or palm,\r\n  concave on its upper surface, horizontal in its direction, and\r\n  forked into two points anteriorly,--an appearance which I have not\r\n  observed in any other specimen of upwards of forty which I have\r\n  seen, nor do I find it marked in any of the plates of those bones\r\n  extant.\r\n\r\n  There is one antler given off posteriorly from the junction of the\r\n  beam with the palm: it runs directly backwards parallel to the\r\n  corresponding one of the opposite horn. The inferior edge of the\r\n  palm beyond this runs outwards and backwards: it is obtuse and\r\n  thick, and its length is two feet six inches. From the anterior\r\n  and external borders of each palm there come off six long pointed\r\n  antlers. None of these are designated by any particular name. The\r\n  number of the antlers of both sides taken together is twenty-two.\r\n\r\n  The surface of the horns is of a lightish colour, resembling that\r\n  of the marl in which they were found; they are rough, and marked\r\n  with several arborescent grooves, where the ramifications of the\r\n  arteries by which they had been nourished during their growing\r\n  state were lodged. The horns, with the head attached, weighed\r\n  eighty-seven pounds avoirdupois. The distance between their extreme\r\n  tips in a right line is nine feet two inches.\r\n\r\n  _Head._--The forehead is marked by a raised ridge extended between\r\n  the roots of the horns; anterior to this, between the orbits and\r\n  the root of the nose, the skull is flat; there is a depression on\r\n  each side in front of the root of the horn and over the orbit,\r\n  capable of lodging the last joint of the thumb, at the bottom of\r\n  which is the superciliary hole, large enough to give passage to\r\n  an artery proportioned to the size of the horns. Inferior to the\r\n  orbit we have the lachrymatory fossa, and the opening left by the\r\n  deficiency of bone common to all deer, and remarkable for being\r\n  smaller in this than in any other species.\r\n\r\n  Below the orbits the skull grows suddenly narrower, and the upper\r\n  parts of the nasal bones become contracted by a depression on\r\n  either side, at the lower part of which is the infra-orbitar hole.\r\n  The opening of the nares is oval, being five inches long by three\r\n  broad, the greatest breadth being in the centre. From the roots of\r\n  the horns to the occipital spine measures three inches and an half;\r\n  the occiput descends at a right angle with this, being three inches\r\n  deep to the foramen magnum: the greatest breadth of the occiput is\r\n  eight inches. The temporal fossæ approach to within two inches of\r\n  each other behind the horns.\r\n\r\n  _Teeth._--They do not differ from those of animals of the\r\n  ruminating class. The incisors were not found, having dropped out;\r\n  there is no mark of canine teeth; the molares are not much worn\r\n  down, and are twenty-four in number.\r\n\r\n  The skeleton measures, from the end of the nose to the tip of\r\n  the tail, ten feet ten inches. The spine consists of twenty-six\r\n  vertebræ, viz. seven cervical, thirteen dorsal, and six lumbar. The\r\n  size of the cervical vertebræ greatly exceeds that of the other\r\n  classes, and the spines of the dorsal rise to a foot in height. The\r\n  necessity of these bones being so marked is obvious, considering\r\n  the strong cervical ligament, and powerful muscles, required for\r\n  supporting and moving a head which, at a moderate calculation, must\r\n  have sustained a weight of three quarters of a hundred of solid\r\n  bony matter.\r\n\r\n  The extremities are in proportion to the different parts of the\r\n  trunk, and present a conformation favourable to a combination of\r\n  great strength with fleetness.\r\n\r\n  It is not the least remarkable circumstance connected with these\r\n  bones, that they are in such a high state of preservation as to\r\n  present all the lines and impressions of the parts which had been\r\n  attached to them in the recent state. Indeed, if we examine them\r\n  as compared with the bones of an animal from which all the softer\r\n  parts have been separated by maceration, the only perceptible\r\n  differences in their physical properties are, that they are a\r\n  little heavier, a degree harder, that their surface is brown, and\r\n  that they all, with the exception of the horns, present a polished\r\n  appearance, which is owing to the periosteum having been preserved,\r\n  and still remaining to cover them, as was discovered when they were\r\n  chemically examined.\r\n\r\n  The existence of fat or adipocire in the shaft of one of the\r\n  bones mentioned by Archdeacon Maunsell, and which I saw in his\r\n  possession, is a thing for which it is extremely difficult to\r\n  account, as it occurred but in one solitary instance, and it did\r\n  not appear that this bone was at all differently circumstanced from\r\n  the rest. Those which I had an opportunity of examining, by boring\r\n  holes in them, were hollow, and contained, for the most part, only\r\n  a small quantity of black animal earth.\r\n\r\n  Mr Stokes found, in a rib of this animal,\r\n\r\n\r\n  Animal matter,                  42.87\r\n  Phosphates with some Fluates,   43.45\r\n  Carb., Lime                      9.14\r\n  Oxides,                          1.02\r\n  Silica,                          1.14\r\n  Water and loss,                  2.38\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100.00\r\n\r\n  Dr Apjohn of Dublin made the following observations with regard to\r\n  the animal matter in the bones:\r\n\r\n  ‘The bone was subjected for two days to the action of dilute\r\n  muriatic acid. When examined at the end of this period, it had\r\n  become as flexible as a recent bone submitted to the action of\r\n  the same solvent. The periosteum was in some parts puffed out by\r\n  carbonic acid gas, disengaged from the bone, and appeared to be in\r\n  a state of perfect soundness.\r\n\r\n  ‘To a portion of the solution of the bone in the muriatic acid some\r\n  infusion of galls was added, which caused a copious precipitate of\r\n  a dun colour. This proved to be tannate of gelatine, mixed with a\r\n  small portion of the tannate and gallate of iron.\r\n\r\n  ‘The cartilage and gelatine, therefore, so far from being\r\n  destroyed, had not been perceptibly altered by time.’”\r\n\r\nUntil Baron Cuvier published his account of these remains[420], they\r\nwere generally believed to have belonged to the same species as the\r\nmoose deer or elk of North America, an opinion which appears to have\r\nbeen first advanced by Dr Thomas Molyneux in 1697[421], and which\r\ndepends principally on the exaggerated description of that animal\r\ngiven by Josselyn in his account of two voyages to New England,\r\npublished in 1674, in which he states that it is sometimes twelve\r\nfeet high, with horns of two fathoms wide! This was the more readily\r\nbelieved by the learned Doctor, as it tended to confirm him in a\r\nfavourite theory which he seems to have entertained, that Ireland had\r\nonce been joined to the New Continent.\r\n\r\nBut the assertions of Josselyn regarding the size of the American\r\nmoose have not been confirmed by the testimony of later travellers,\r\nfrom whose observations it is now clearly ascertained that the only\r\nlarge species of deer inhabiting the northern parts of America are\r\nthe wapiti or Canadian stag (_Cervus canadensis_), the rein-deer (_C.\r\nTarandus_), and the moose or elk (_C. Alces_).\r\n\r\nThe peculiar branching of the brow antlers of the rein-deer, and\r\nthe rounded horns of the wapiti[422], are characters sufficient\r\nto prevent us confounding either of these animals with the fossil\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe palmate form of the horns of the elk gave greater probability to\r\nthe opinion of its specific identity with the fossil animal.\r\n\r\nA little attention, however, to a few circumstances, will shew a most\r\nmarked difference between them.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to size, the difference is very remarkable, it not being\r\nuncommon to find the fossil horns ten feet between the extreme\r\ntips[423], while the largest elk’s horns never measure four feet.\r\nThis measurement in a pair in the Museum of the Royal Dublin Society,\r\nis three feet seven inches: the largest pair seen by Pennant in the\r\nhouse of the Hudson’s Bay Company, measured thirty-four inches[424].\r\n\r\nThe horn of the elk has two palms, a lesser one which grows forward\r\nfrom the front of the beam, where the principal palm begins to\r\nexpand. This is called brow antler by Cuvier, but it corresponds in\r\nsituation rather to the sur-antler, there being, properly speaking,\r\nno brow antler attached to the root of the beam. The elk has no\r\nposterior antler similar to that of the fossil animal, nor does its\r\nbeam take a similar arched direction, but runs more directly outwards.\r\n\r\nCuvier remarks, that the palm of the fossil horn increases in breadth\r\nas it extends outwardly, while that of the elk is broadest next the\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nThe palm of the elk’s horn is directed more backwards, while the\r\nfossil one extends more in the lateral direction. The antlers of the\r\nelk are shorter and more numerous than those of the fossil animals.\r\n\r\nAs the horns of the fossil animal exceed in size those of the elk,\r\nso, on the contrary, does the skull of the latter exceed in size\r\nthat of the former; the largest heads of the fossil species not\r\nexceeding one foot nine inches in length, while the head of the elk\r\nis frequently two feet. The fossil head is broader in proportion;\r\nits length being to its breadth as two to one; in the elk they are\r\nas three to one, according to Parkinson.[425] The breadth of the\r\nskull between the roots of the horns is but four inches in the fossil\r\nskulls; in that of the elk in the Society’s Museum it is 6½ inches.\r\n\r\nCuvier thinks it probable that the females of the fossil species had\r\nhorns[426], an opinion to which I am very much disposed to subscribe,\r\nfrom having observed that these parts present differences in size and\r\nstrength, which appear not to be dependent on differences of age.\r\nFor instance, the teeth of the specimen in Trinity College are much\r\nmore worn down, and the sutures of the skull are more effaced than\r\nin the specimen described in this paper; yet the horns of the latter\r\nare much more concave, and more expanded, than those of the former;\r\nand on comparing a single horn of each of these specimens together,\r\nthat belonging to the Society exceeds the other by nearly a sixth\r\nin the length, and little less than a third in the breadth; it is\r\nnot, therefore, unlikely that the animal whose horns were larger and\r\nmore curved was a male. Something similar to this is observed in the\r\nrein-deer, both sexes of which have horns, but with this difference,\r\nthat they are smaller and less branched in the female. Hence we find\r\nthat this animal possessed characters of its own sufficient to prove\r\nit of a species as distinct from the moose or elk as this latter\r\nspecies is from the rein-deer or any other. Therefore, it is improper\r\nto retain the name of elk or moose deer any longer: perhaps it might\r\nbe better called the _Cervus megaceros_, a name merely expressive of\r\nthe great size of its horns.\r\n\r\nThat this animal shed its head furniture periodically, is proved\r\nby the occasional occurrence of detached horns having the smooth\r\nconvex surface below the burr, similar to what is observed on the\r\ncast horns of all deer. Specimens of this are to be seen in the\r\nMuseum of Trinity College, and I possess one myself, of which I have\r\nhad a drawing made. As every other species of deer shed their horns\r\nannually, there is no reason for supposing that that process occurred\r\nat longer intervals in this.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular opinion with the Indians that the elk is subject to\r\nepilepsy, with which he is frequently seized when pursued, and thus\r\nrendered an easy prey to the hunters. Many naturalists affect to\r\ndisbelieve this account, without, however, assigning any sufficient\r\nreason. But if it be considered, that, during the growth of the\r\nhorns, there must be a great increased determination of blood to\r\nthose parts, which are supplied by the frontal artery, a branch from\r\nthe internal carotid, it is quite conformable to well established\r\npathological principles, to suppose, that, after the horns are\r\nperfected, and have ceased to receive any more blood, that fluid may\r\nbe determined to those internal branches of the carotid which supply\r\nthe brain, and establish a predisposition to such derangements of\r\nits circulation as would produce epilepsy, or even apoplexy: if such\r\nan effect were produced in consequence of the size of the horns in\r\nthe elk, it is reasonable to suppose that it prevailed in a greater\r\ndegree in the fossil animal whose horns were so much larger.\r\n\r\nWhat could have been the use of these immense horns? It is quite\r\nevident that they would prevent the animal making any progress\r\nthrough a thickly wooded country, and that the long, tapering,\r\npointed antlers were totally unfit for lopping off the branches of\r\ntrees, a use to which the elk sometimes applies his horns[427], and\r\nfor which they seem well calculated, by having their antlers short\r\nand strong, and set along the edge of the palm, somewhat resembling\r\nthe teeth of a saw in their arrangement. It would rather appear,\r\nthen, that they were given the animal as weapons for its protection,\r\na purpose for which they seem to have been admirably designed; for\r\ntheir lateral expansion is such, that should occasion require the\r\nanimal to use them in his defence, their extreme tips would easily\r\nreach beyond the remotest parts of his body; and if we consider the\r\npowerful muscles for moving the head, whose attachments occupied\r\nthe extensive surfaces of the cervical vertebræ, with the length of\r\nthe lever afforded by the horns themselves, we can easily conceive\r\nhow he could wield them with a force and velocity which would deal\r\ndestruction to any enemy having the hardihood to venture within their\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nFrom the formidable appearance of these horns, then, we must suppose\r\nthat their possessor was obnoxious to the aggressions of some\r\ncarnivorous animals of ferocious habits; and such we know to have\r\nabounded in Ireland, as the wolf, and the celebrated Irish wolf dog.\r\nNor would it be surprising if limestone caves should be discovered\r\nin this country, containing the remains of beasts of prey and their\r\nvictims, similar to the hyænas’ dens of Kirkdale, and other places,\r\nrespecting which such interesting researches have been lately laid\r\nbefore the public by the geologists of this country and the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe absence of all record, or even tradition, respecting this\r\nanimal[428], naturally leads one to inquire whether man inhabited\r\nthis country during its existence? I think there is presumptive\r\nevidence in the affirmative of this question, afforded by the\r\nfollowing circumstances. A head of this animal described by Professor\r\nGoldfuss of Bonn, was discovered in Germany in the same drain with\r\nseveral urns and stone hatchets; and in the 7th volume of the\r\nArchæologia Britannica, is a letter of the Countess of Moira, giving\r\nan account of a human body found in gravel, under eleven feet of peat\r\nsoaked in the bog water: it was in good preservation, and completely\r\nclothed in antique garments of hair, which her ladyship thinks might\r\nhave been that of our fossil animal. But more conclusive evidence\r\non this question is derived from the appearance exhibited by a rib,\r\npresented by Archdeacon Maunsell to the Royal Dublin Society, in\r\nwhich I discovered an oval opening near its lower edge, the long\r\ndiameter of which is parallel to the length of the rib, its margin\r\nis depressed on the outer, and raised on the inner surface, round\r\nwhich there is an irregular effusion of callus. This opening had\r\nbeen evidently produced by a sharp pointed instrument, which did not\r\npenetrate so deep as to cause the animal’s death, but which remained\r\nfixed in the opening for some length of time afterward; in fact it\r\nwas such an effect as would be produced by the head of an arrow\r\nremaining in a wound after the shaft was broken off[429].\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, therefore, that the chace of this gigantic\r\nanimal once supplied the inhabitants of this country with food and\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nAs to the causes which led to the extinction of this animal, whether\r\nit was suddenly destroyed by the deluge, or by some other great\r\ncatastrophe of nature, or whether it was ultimately exterminated\r\nby the continued and successful persecution of its pursuers, as\r\nhas nearly been the case with the red deer within the recollection\r\nof many of the present generation, I profess myself unable to form\r\nany decided opinion, owing to the limited number of facts as yet\r\ncollected on the subject. On some future occasion I may, perhaps,\r\nbe induced to revert to so interesting a topic, should I have\r\nopportunities of discovering any thing worthy of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Table exhibits a comparative view of the measurements\r\nof different parts of the skeletons of the Cervus Megaceros in\r\nthe Museum of the Royal Dublin Society, and in the Royal Museum\r\nof the University of Edinburgh, with some parts of the Moose. The\r\nmeasurements of the Edinburgh specimen are taken from Professor\r\nJameson’s memoir on _organic remains_, in the Supplement to the\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica.\r\n\r\n                                 |R.

ELEPHAS AFRICANUS.--_The Elephant with rounded skull, large ears,\r\ngrinders, having rhomboidal-shaped marks on their crown, which we\r\ncall the African Elephant_ (_Elephas Africanus_), is a quadruped\r\nwhich has hitherto been found only inhabiting Africa. There can\r\nbe no doubt that it is this species which lives at the Cape, at\r\nSenegal, and in Guinea; there is reason to believe that it also\r\noccurs at Mosambique; but it is not certain that individuals of the\r\nfollowing species do not occur in this part of Africa. A sufficient\r\nnumber of individuals have not been figured or compared, to know if\r\nthis species presents remarkable varieties. It is it that produces\r\nthe largest tusks. Both sexes are equally furnished with tusks, at\r\nleast at Senegal. _The natural number of the hoofs is four before,\r\nand three behind._ The ear is very large, and covers the shoulder.\r\nThe skin is of a deep and uniform brown. This species has not been\r\ndomesticated in modern times. It appears, however, to have been tamed\r\nby the ancients, who attributed to it less power and courage in\r\nthat state than to the following species; but their observations do\r\nnot appear to have been confirmed, at least in so far as refers to\r\nmagnitude. Its natural manners are not perfectly known; yet judging\r\nof them by the notices of travellers, they appear to resemble in\r\nevery thing essential those of the following species.\r\n\r\n2. ELEPHAS INDICUS.--_The Elephant with elongated skull, concave\r\nforehead, small ears, grinders marked with undulating bands_, which\r\nwe call the _Indian Elephant_ (_Elephas Indicus_), is a quadruped\r\nwhich has only been observed with certainty beyond the Indus. It\r\nextends from both sides of the Ganges to the Eastern Sea and the\r\nsouth of China. They are also found in the Islands of the Indian Sea,\r\nin Ceylon, Java, Borneo, Sumatra, &c. There is still no authentic\r\nproof that it exists in any part of Africa, although neither is the\r\ncontrary absolutely proved. The inhabitants of India having from\r\ntime immemorial been in the habit of taking this species and taming\r\nit, it has been much better observed than the other. Varieties have\r\nbeen remarked as to size, lightness of form, the length and direction\r\nof the tusks, and the colours of the skin. The females and some of\r\nthe males have tusks which are always small and straight. The tusks\r\nof the other males never attain so great a length as in the African\r\nspecies[430]. _The natural number of the hoofs is five before and\r\nfour behind._ The ear is small, frequently angular. The skin is\r\ncommonly grey, spotted with brown. There are individuals entirely\r\nwhite. The height varies from fifteen to sixteen feet. Its manners,\r\nthe mode of taking it, and of treating it, have been carefully\r\ndescribed by many travellers and naturalists, from Aristotle down to\r\nMr Corse Scott.\r\n\r\n3. ELEPHAS PRIMIGENIUS, Blum, or MAMMOTH.--_The Elephant with\r\nelongated skull, concave forehead, very long alveolæ for the tusks,\r\nthe lower jaw obtuse, the grinders broader, parallel, marked with\r\ncloser bands_, which we name the _Fossil Elephant_ (_Elephas\r\nprimigenius_, Blum.), is the _Mammoth_ of the Russians. Its bones\r\nare only found in the fossil state. No person has seen in a fresh\r\nstate bones resembling those by which this species is peculiarly\r\ndistinguished, nor have the bones of the two preceding species been\r\nseen in the fossil state.[431] Its bones are found in great number\r\nin many countries, but in better preservation in the north than\r\nelsewhere. It resembles the Indian more than the African species. It\r\ndiffers, however, from the former in the grinders, in the form of\r\nthe lower jaw, and many other bones, but especially in the length\r\nof the alveolæ and tusks. This last character must have singularly\r\nmodified the figure and organisation of its proboscis, and given it a\r\nphysiognomy much more different from that of the Indian species, than\r\nmight have been expected from the similarity of the rest of their\r\nbones. It appears that its tusks were generally large, frequently\r\nmore or less spirally arcuate, and directed outwards. There is no\r\nproof that they differ much according to differences of sex or\r\nrace. The size was not much greater than that to which the Indian\r\nspecies may attain; it appears to have been still clumsier in its\r\nproportions. It is already manifest from its osseous remains, that\r\nit was a species differing more from the Indian, than the ass from\r\nthe horse, and the jackal and isatis from the wolf and fox. It is not\r\nknown what had been the size of its ears, or the colour of its skin;\r\nbut it is certain that, at least, some individuals bore two sorts\r\nof hair, namely, a red, coarse, tufted wool, and stiff black hairs,\r\nwhich, upon the neck and along the dorsal spine, became long enough\r\nto form a sort of mane. Thus, not only is there nothing impossible\r\nin its having been able to support a climate which would destroy the\r\nIndian species, but it is even probable that it was so constituted\r\nas to prefer cold climates. Its bones are generally found in the\r\nalluvial and superficial strata of the earth, and most commonly in\r\nthe deposits which fill up the bottom of valleys, or which border\r\nthe beds of rivers. They scarcely ever occur by themselves, but are\r\nconfusedly mingled with bones of other quadrupeds of known genera,\r\nsuch as rhinoceroses, oxen, antelopes, horses, and frequently with\r\nremains of marine animals, particularly conchiferous species, some of\r\nwhich have even been found adhering to them. The positive testimony\r\nof Pallas, Fortis, and many others, does not allow us to doubt that\r\nthis latter circumstance has frequently taken place, although it is\r\nnot always observed. We ourselves have at this moment under our eyes\r\na portion of a jaw covered with millepores and small oysters.\r\n\r\nThe strata which cover the bones of elephants are not of very great\r\nthickness, and they are scarcely ever of a rocky nature. They are\r\nseldom petrified, and there are only one or two cases recorded in\r\nwhich they were found imbedded in a shelly or other rock. Frequently\r\nthey are simply accompanied with our common fresh water shells. The\r\nresemblance, in this latter respect, as well as with regard to the\r\nnature of the soil, between the three places, of which we have the\r\nmost detailed accounts, viz. _Tonna_, _Cantstadt_, and the _Forest\r\nof Bondi_, is very remarkable. Every thing, therefore, seems to\r\nannounce that the cause which has buried them, is one of the most\r\nrecent of those that have contributed to change the surface of the\r\nglobe. It is nevertheless a physical and general cause; the bones of\r\n_fossil elephants_ are so numerous, and have been found in places so\r\ndesert and even uninhabitable, that we cannot suppose that they had\r\nbeen conducted there by man. The strata which contain them and those\r\nwhich are above them, shew, that this cause was aqueous, or that it\r\nwas water that covered them; and in many places these waters were\r\nnearly the same as those of our present sea, since they supported\r\nanimals nearly the same. But, it was not by these waters that they\r\nwere transported to the places where they now are. Bones of this\r\ndescription have been found in almost every country that has been\r\nexamined by naturalists. An irruption of the sea that might have\r\nbrought them from places which the _Indian elephant_ now inhabits,\r\ncould not have scattered them so far, nor dispersed them so equably.\r\nBesides, the inundation which buried them has not risen above the\r\ngreat chains of mountains, since the strata which it has deposited,\r\nand which cover the bones, are only found in plains of little\r\nelevation. It is not, therefore, seen how the carcases of elephants\r\ncould have been transported into the north, across the mountains of\r\n_Thibet_, and the _Altaic_ and _Uralian_ chains.\r\n\r\nFurther, these bones are not rolled; they retain their ridges and\r\napophyses; they have not been worn by friction. Very frequently the\r\nepiphyses of those which had not yet attained their full growth, are\r\nstill attached to them, although the slightest effort would suffice\r\nto detach them. The only alterations that are remarked, arise from\r\nthe decomposition which they have undergone during their abode in\r\nthe earth. Nor can it with more reason be represented that the\r\nentire carcases had been violently transported. In this case, the\r\nbones would indeed have remained entire; but they would also have\r\nremained together, and would not have been scattered. The shells,\r\nmillepores, and other marine productions which are attached to some\r\nof these bones, prove besides that they had remained at least some\r\ntime stripped and separated at the bottom of the fluid which covered\r\nthem. The elephants’ bones had therefore already been in the places\r\nin which they are found, when the fluid covered them. They were\r\nscattered about in the same manner as in our own country the bones\r\nof horses and other animals that inhabit it may be, and as the dead\r\nbodies are spread in the fields.\r\n\r\nEvery circumstance, therefore, renders it extremely probable, that\r\nthe elephants which have furnished the fossil bones, dwelt and\r\nlived in the countries where their bones are at present found. They\r\ncould only, therefore, have disappeared by a revolution, which had\r\ndestroyed all the individuals then living, or by a change of climate,\r\nwhich prevented them from propagating. But whatever this cause may\r\nhave been, it must have been sudden. The bones and ivory which are\r\nfound in so perfect a state of preservation in the plains of Siberia,\r\nare only so preserved by the cold which congeals them there, or\r\nwhich, in general, arrests the action of the elements upon them. If\r\nthis cold had come on by degrees and slowly, these bones, and still\r\nmore the soft parts with which they are still sometimes invested,\r\nwould have had time to decompose, like those which occur in warm and\r\ntemperate countries. It would especially have been impossible that an\r\nentire carcase, like that discovered by Mr Adams, could have retained\r\nits flesh and skin without corruption, if it had not been immediately\r\nenveloped by the ice which preserved it. Thus, all the hypotheses of\r\na gradual cooling of the earth, or of a slow variation, whether in\r\nthe inclination or in the position of the axis of the globe, fall to\r\nbe rejected.\r\n\r\nIf the present _elephants_ of _India_ were the descendants of these\r\nancient elephants, which have been preserved in that climate to\r\nthe present day, from their being there placed beyond the reach\r\nof the catastrophe which destroyed them in the others, it would\r\nbe impossible to explain why their species has been destroyed in\r\nAmerica, where remains are still found, which prove that they had\r\nformerly existed there. The vast empire of Mexico presented to them\r\nheights enough to escape from an inundation so little elevated as\r\nthat which we must suppose to have taken place, and the climate there\r\nis warmer than is requisite for their temperament.\r\n\r\nThe various _mastodons_, the _hippopotamus_ and the _fossil\r\nrhinoceros_ lived in the same countries, and in the same districts,\r\nas the _elephants_, since their bones are found in the same strata\r\nand in the same state. Yet these animals very assuredly no longer\r\nexist. Every thing therefore, Cuvier maintains, concurs to induce a\r\nbelief that the _fossil elephant_ is, like them, an extinct species,\r\nalthough it resembles more than they one of the species at present\r\nexisting, and that its extinction has been produced by a sudden\r\ncause, by the same great catastrophe which destroyed the species of\r\nthe same epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _On the Great Mastodon, or Animal of the Ohio._\r\n\r\nIt appears that the _Great Mastodon_ or _Animal of the Ohio_,\r\nwas very like the elephant in its tusks and whole skeleton, the\r\ngrinders excepted; that it very probably had a proboscis; that\r\nits height did not exceed that of the elephant, but that it was a\r\nlittle more elongated, and had limbs somewhat thicker, with a more\r\nslender belly. Notwithstanding all these points of resemblance, the\r\npeculiar structure of its grinders is sufficient to constitute it\r\nof a different genus from the elephant. It further appears, that it\r\nfed much in the same manner as the hippopotamus and boar, choosing\r\nby preference the roots and other fleshy parts of vegetables; that\r\nthis sort of food must have drawn it towards the soft and marshy\r\nplaces; that, nevertheless, it was not formed for swimming, and\r\nliving often in the water like the hippopotamus, but that it was a\r\ntrue land animal. Its bones are much more common in North America\r\nthan any where else. They are even perhaps exclusively confined to\r\nthat country. They are better preserved, and fresher, than any other\r\nfossil bones known; and, nevertheless, there is not the slightest\r\nproof, the smallest authentic testimony, calculated to impress a\r\nbelief that either in America, or any where else, there is still any\r\nliving individual, for the various accounts which we have from time\r\nto time read in the journals respecting living mastodons, which had\r\nbeen observed in the forests or plains of that vast continent, have\r\nnever been confirmed, and can only pass for fables.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nON THE CAVES IN WHICH BONES OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS OCCUR IN GREAT\r\nQUANTITIES.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary accumulations of fossil bones in caves and caverns\r\nin different districts, especially in those composed of limestone,\r\nhave for many years engaged the attention of inquirers; and, of\r\nlate, have afforded many interesting facts to the geologist and\r\nzoologist. In England, as will appear from the following details,\r\nmany different fossil animals have been discovered in limestone\r\ncaves; but hitherto the caves in Scotland, which will probably be\r\nfound to contain interesting documents of an ancient population, have\r\nnot been examined. As the subject is a curious and interesting one,\r\nwe shall, in the following pages, principally from Cuvier’s great\r\nwork, lay before our readers a pretty full account of the different\r\ncaves, especially those that afford bones of carnivorous animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNumerous caves, brilliantly decorated with stalactites of every form,\r\nsucceeding each other to a great depth in the interior of mountains,\r\ncommunicating together by openings so narrow as scarcely to allow a\r\nman to enter them crawling, and which are yet found strewed with an\r\nenormous quantity of bones of large and small animals, are without\r\ndispute among the most remarkable phenomena which the history of\r\nfossil remains could present to the contemplation of the geologist,\r\nespecially when we reflect that this phenomenon recurs in a great\r\nnumber of places, and over a very extended space of country. These\r\ncaves have been the object of research of several naturalists,\r\nsome of whom have well described and figured the bones which they\r\ncontain; and even before they were explored by the naturalist, they\r\nwere celebrated among the common people, who, according to their\r\ncustom, added many imaginary prodigies to the natural wonders which\r\nare really observed in them. The bones which they contain were long,\r\nunder the name of _fossil unicorn_, an important article of commerce\r\nand materia medica, on account of the powerful virtues which were\r\nattributed to them; and it is probable that the desire of finding\r\nthese bones contributed much to the more accurate knowledge of these\r\ncaves, and even to the discovery of several of them.\r\n\r\nThe most anciently celebrated is the cave of _Bauman_, situated in\r\nthe country of _Blankenburg_, which belongs to the Duke of Brunswick,\r\nto the south of the city of that name, to the east of _Elbingerode_,\r\nand to the north of the village of _Rubeland_, the nearest inhabited\r\nplace, in a hill which forms one of the last declivities of the\r\n_Hartz_ toward the east. It has been described by many authors, among\r\nwhom we shall particularly mention the great _Leibnitz_, in his\r\n_Protogæa_, pl. i. p. 97, where he gives a map of it, borrowed from\r\nthe _Acta Eruditorum_ 1702, p. 305.\r\n\r\nIts general direction is east and west, but the entrance faces the\r\nnorth. It is very narrow, although it is under a pretty large natural\r\nvault. The first cave is the largest. From this to the second, one\r\nmust descend by another narrow passage, at first by creeping, and\r\nafterwards by a ladder. The difference of level is 30 feet. The\r\nsecond cave is the richest in stalactite of all forms. The passage\r\nto the third cave is at first the most difficult of all, and we have\r\nto climb with hands and feet; but it afterwards enlarges, and the\r\nstalactites of its walls are those in which the imagination of the\r\ncurious has pretended to see the best characterized figures. It has\r\ntwo lateral dilatations, of which the map of the _Acta Eruditorum_\r\nmakes the third and fourth caves. At its extremity, we have still to\r\nascend, in order to arrive at the real third cave, which forms a sort\r\nof portal. _Behrens_ says, in his _Hercynia curiosa_, that it cannot\r\nbe reached, because it would be necessary to descend more than 60\r\nfeet; but the above mentioned map, and the description of _Von der\r\nHardt_, which accompanies it, describe this third cave under the name\r\nof the Fifth, and place beyond it a narrow passage, terminated by two\r\nsmall grottoes. Lastly, _Silberschlag_, in his _Geogony_, adds, that\r\none of these grottoes leads to a narrow passage, which, descending\r\nmuch, leads under the other caves, and terminates in a place filled\r\nwith water. There are still many bones in these remote and little\r\nfrequented parts. Most of those bones which are in collections from\r\nthis cave, or which have been described, are of the bear genus.\r\n\r\nA second cave, nearly as celebrated as the former, and very near,\r\nis that which is named, after the _unicorn, Enihornshæle_, at the\r\nfoot of the chateau of _Scharzfels_, in a part of the Electorate\r\nof Hanover which is named the Dutchy of _Grubenhagen_, and nearly\r\nupon the last southern declivity of the _Hartz_. It has also been\r\ndescribed by _Leibnitz_, as well as by _M. Deluc_, in his Letters\r\nto the Queen of England. The entrance is 10 feet high, and 7 broad.\r\nWe descend vertically 15 feet into a sort of vestibule, the roof of\r\nwhich lowers to such a degree, that, at the end of 60 feet, we are\r\nobliged to creep. After a long passage, we come to two other caves,\r\naccording to Leibnitz; but Behrens adds three or four, and says,\r\nthat, according to the country people, we might penetrate nearly two\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\n_Bruckmann_, who gives a map of this cavern (_Epistol. Itin._ p.\r\n34.), represents only five caves, arranged nearly in a straight line,\r\nand connected by extremely narrow passages. The second is the richest\r\nin bones; the third, which is the most irregular, has two small\r\nlateral caves; the fifth is the smallest, and contains a fountain. Of\r\nthe bones which have been taken from it, some are in the possession\r\nof M. Blumenbach and other naturalists; and others have been figured\r\nby _Leibnitz_ and _Mylius_. They belong to the bear, hyena, and tiger\r\nor lion genera.\r\n\r\nThe chain of the Hartz also presents some other caves of less\r\ncelebrity, although of the same nature mentioned by Behrens in his\r\nHercynia curiosa, namely,\r\n\r\nThe cave of _Hartzburg_, under the castle of the same name, above\r\n_Goslar_ to the south. We do not know why Büsching disputes its\r\nexistence. It is true that Behrens cites J. D. Horstius erroneously,\r\nfor having seen bones of various animals taken from it; for Horstius\r\nspeaks only (_Obs. Anat. dec._ p. 10.) of the cave of _Scharzfels_.\r\n\r\nThe cave of _Ufftrungen_, in the county of _Stollberg_, to the south\r\nof the castle of that name. It is named in the country _Heim-knohle_,\r\nor _Hiding-hole_. Behrens thinks that fossil bones might be found in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnother cave of the same neighbourhood, is named _Diebsloch, Thieves’\r\nHole_. Skulls have been found in it, which were supposed to be human.\r\n\r\nWe shall not speak here of those caves of the Hartz in which bones\r\nhave not been discovered. And even those in which they have been\r\nfound, are, at the present day, almost exhausted, it being only by\r\nbreaking the stalactite that any can be obtained, so much of them had\r\nbeen taken away for selling as medicines.\r\n\r\nThe caves of _Hungary_ come after those of the Hartz, with reference\r\nto the remoteness of the time at which they have been known. The\r\nfirst notice of them is due to _Paterson Hayn_, (Ephem. Nat.\r\nCur. 1672, Obs. cxxxix. and cxciv.) _Bruckmann_, a physician of\r\n_Wolfenbüttel_, afterwards described them at length. (_Epistola\r\nItineraria_, 77, and _Breslauer Sammlung_, 1725, First Trim. p.\r\n628.) They are situated in the county of _Liptow_, on the southern\r\ndeclivities of the _Carpathian mountains_. They are known in the\r\ncountry by the name of _Dragons’ Caves_, because the people of the\r\nneighbourhood attribute to those animals the bones which occur in\r\nthem, and with which they have been acquainted from time immemorial;\r\nbut all those which have been figured by authors belong to the Bear\r\nfamily, and to the species which is named the _Great Cave Bear_\r\n(_Grand Ours des cavernes_).\r\n\r\nThe caves of Germany the richest in bones are those of _Franconia_,\r\nof which _J. F. Esper_, a clergyman of the country of _Bayreuth_,\r\nhas given a very detailed description in a work, printed in French\r\nand German, entitled, _Description des Zoolithes nouvellement\r\ndecouvertes_, &c. _Nuremberg Knorr._ 1774, folio, with 14 coloured\r\nplates, and in a memoir inserted among those of the _Berlin Society\r\nof Naturalists_, vol. ix. 1784, p. 56. Another description was\r\nafterwards given, under the title of _Objets dignes de remarque des\r\nenvirons de Muggendorf_, by J. C. Rosenmüller, folio, with coloured\r\nviews, Berlin, 1804. And more lately, M. Goldfuss, at present\r\nProfessor of Natural History at Bonn, and Secretary of the _Academia\r\nNaturæ Curiosorum_, has made them the subject of a particular\r\nwork printed in 1810 in German, under the title of _Environs of\r\nMuggendorf_, in which he describes them with the greatest care, as\r\nwell as the surrounding country, of which he gives a very correct\r\ntopographical chart. A great part of these caves is situated in a\r\nsmall bailiwick, named _Streitberg_, which was formerly a dependence\r\nupon the country of _Bayreuth_, but was inclosed in that of\r\n_Bamberg_, and now forms part of the kingdom of Bavaria. The greatest\r\nnumber occur in a small peninsula, formed by the river of _Wiesent_,\r\nwhich falls into the Pegnetz, and belongs to the basin of the _Main_.\r\n\r\nHowever, the chief of all these astonishing caves, those of\r\n_Gaylenreuth_, are beyond the limits of this peninsula, being on the\r\nleft bank of the Wiesent, to the north-west of the village from which\r\nit derives its name. The entrance is perforated in a vertical rock;\r\nit is 7½ feet high, and faces the east. The first cave turns to the\r\nright, and is upwards of 80 feet long. The unequal heights of the\r\nvault divide it into four parts; the first three are from 15 to 20\r\nfeet high, the fourth is only 4 or 5. At the bottom of this latter,\r\non the level of the floor, there is a hole 2 feet high, which affords\r\na passage to the second cave: it has first a direction to the south,\r\nover a length of 60 feet by 40 in breadth, and 18 in height; it\r\nthen turns to the west for 70 feet, becoming lower and lower until\r\nat length the height is only 5 feet. The passage which leads to the\r\nthird cave is very inconvenient, and one has to turn through various\r\ncorridors: it is 30 feet across, and from 5 to 6 in height. The\r\nground in it is kneaded with teeth and jaws. Near the entrance is a\r\npit of from 15 to 20 feet, to which one descends by a ladder. After\r\nhaving descended, we come to a vault of 15 feet diameter by 30 in\r\nheight; and towards the side at which the descent is made there is a\r\ncave strewed with bones. On still descending a little, a new arcade\r\nis met with, which leads to a cave 40 feet long, and a new pit of\r\nfrom 18 to 20 feet deep. After descending this, we reach a cavern\r\nabout 40 feet high, all strewed with bones. A passage, of 5 feet by\r\n7, leads to a grotto of 25 feet in length by 12 in breadth. Canals,\r\n20 feet in length, conduct to another grotto of 20 feet in height.\r\nLastly, there is another cave, 83 feet broad and 24 high, in which\r\nmore bones are found than in any of the others.\r\n\r\nThe sixth cave, which is the last, has a northerly direction, so that\r\nthe whole series of caves and passages nearly describes a semicircle.\r\n\r\nA fissure in the third cave led to the discovery, in 1784, of a new\r\ncave, 15 feet long and 4 broad, in which the greatest quantities of\r\nhyena and lions’ bones were found. The aperture was much too small\r\nfor these animals to have passed through it. A particular canal which\r\nended in this small cave has afforded an incredible number of bones\r\nand large skulls entire.\r\n\r\nIn the Philosophical Transactions of 1822, pl. xxvi. there may be\r\nseen a profile of this cave, taken on the spot in 1816, by Professor\r\nBuckland, in which is to be especially remarked an enormous mass,\r\nentirely composed of bones enveloped in the stalactite, and thus\r\nforming an osseous breccia, but of quite a different nature from\r\nthose which occur at Gibraltar and other places[432].\r\n\r\nThe cave of _Gaylenreuth_ is one of those the bones of which are most\r\ncompletely known, by the researches which have been made or caused to\r\nbe made in it for a long time back by distinguished naturalists, such\r\nas MM. Esper, de Humboldt, Ebel of Bremen, Rosenmüller, Sœmmering,\r\nGoldfuss, &c., and by the numerous and rich collections which these\r\nresearches have produced. According to the examination which Cuvier\r\nhas made of the principal of these collections, three-fourths of\r\nthe bones found there belong to the Bear genus, and to two or three\r\nspecies of that genus. The others belong to the hyena, tiger, wolf,\r\nfox, glutton, and polecat, or some nearly allied species. There are\r\nalso found, although in much smaller number, bones of herbivorous\r\nquadrupeds, and, in particular, deer, of which fragments are in the\r\npossession of M. Ebel. It would even appear from a passage of M.\r\nSœmmering’s, that a parcel of bones had been got in it belonging to\r\nan elephant’s skull[433]. According to Rosenmüller, there were found\r\nin it bones of men, horses, oxen, sheep, deer, roes, mules, badgers,\r\ndogs, and foxes, but which from the researches made by him in the\r\ncave itself, and from their state of preservation, must have been\r\ndeposited at periods much later than those of the bear, tigers and\r\nhyenas[434].\r\n\r\nThe small peninsula situate nearly opposite to this cave, presents\r\nseveral other caves, as the _Schœnstein_, or _Beautiful Rock_, which\r\ncontains seven contiguous caverns. The _Brunnenstein_, or _Fountain\r\nRock_, in which, according to Esper, there are only found bones of\r\nknown species, such as badgers, dogs, foxes, hogs, and deer; but\r\nEsper had too little anatomical knowledge for his testimony to be\r\nentirely relied on with respect to this. These bones are sometimes\r\nencrusted with stalactite. It contains also the _Holeberg_, or\r\n_Hollow Mountain_, in which eight or ten caves form a series of 200\r\nfeet in length, with two entrances. Bones of the same bears as at\r\n_Gaylenreuth_, are found here in various lateral depressions; and\r\nthere are also deer and hogs.--The _Wizerloch_, so named from an\r\nancient Sclavonic deity formerly worshipped there, the most dismal\r\ncavern of the whole country, situate in its most elevated part, and\r\nin which some vertebræ have been found. It is more than 200 feet\r\nlong. The _Wunderhœhle_, which takes its name from its discoverer,\r\nhas been known since 1773: its extent is 160 feet.--Lastly, the\r\nCave of _Klaustein_, consisting of four grottoes, and upwards of\r\n200 feet deep. Bones have been found in the third grotto, and most\r\nabundantly towards its extremity. It might be supposed that the name\r\n_Klaustein_ signified _Claw-rock_, and it would thus accord very well\r\nwith a place where, without doubt, as at Gaylenreuth, a multitude of\r\nungual phalanges of bears and animals of the tiger kind have been\r\nfound. But M. Goldfuss asserts, that it was called _Klaustein_, or\r\n_St Nicholas’s Rock_, after a chapel of this name, which formerly\r\nstood upon it.--There are still the _Geiss-knok_, or _Goat Cave_, and\r\na cave discovered in 1793. M. Rosenmüller found in them two human\r\nskeletons already covered with stalactite.\r\n\r\nThe country which surrounds this small peninsula has itself several\r\ncaves, independently of that of _Gaylenreuth_, as those of _Mockas_,\r\n_Rabenstein_, and _Kirch-ahorn_, three villages, situate, the first\r\nto the south, and the other two to the north-east of Gaylenreuth.\r\nBones were formerly found in the first. The last bears in the\r\ncountry the expressive name of _Zahn-loch_, or _Tooth Cave_; it also\r\nbears the name of _Hohen-mirschfeld_, a village on whose ground it\r\nis situate; and the country people have long been in the habit of\r\nseeking in it those bones, which they imagined to be medicinal. MM.\r\nRosenmüller and Goldfuss have in fact found bear and tiger bones.\r\nThere are two others in the territory of the same village, of which\r\nthe one named _Schneider-loch_ (_Tailor’s Hole_), is said to have\r\nfurnished the vertebræ of an elephant. That of _Zewig_, close upon\r\n_Waschenfeld_, at the very edge of the _Wiesent_, is nearly 80 feet\r\ndeep; and it is said that skeletons of men and wolves were found in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAll these hills, containing caves in their interior, and situate so\r\nnear each other, seem to form a small chain, interrupted only by\r\nbrooks, and which joins the more elevated chain of the _Fichtelberg_,\r\nin which are the highest mountains of Franconia, and from which flow\r\nthe _Main_, the _Saale_, the _Eger_, the _Naab_, and many small\r\nrivers. M. Rosenmüller, and after him, others assert, that those\r\nwhich are in the hills to the north of the _Wiesent_, contain not\r\na single fragment of bone, while those to the south are filled with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn 1799, a cave, remarkable for its situation, was discovered,\r\nwhich connects in some measure those of the _Hartz_ with those of\r\n_Franconia_. It is the Cave of _Glücksbrun_, in the bailiwick of\r\n_Altenstein_, in the territory of _Meinungen_, on the south-western\r\ndeclivity of the chain of the _Thuringerwald_ (Blumenb. _Archæol.\r\nTelluris_, p. 15. _Zach. Monate. Corresp. 1800, January_, p. 30.)\r\nIt is the same which M. Rosenmüller names _Libenstein_, on account\r\nof its being on the road from _Altenstein_ to this latter, which is\r\na bathing place. There is a description of it by M. Kocher, in the\r\n_Magazin für Mineralogie_, by M. C. E. A. De Hof, 1st band. heft. iv.\r\np. 427. The limestone in which it is situate rests upon bituminous\r\nschist, and, rising much upwards, comes to rest upon primitive rocks.\r\nThe limestone varies in hardness and in the nature of its fracture,\r\nand contains marine petrifactions, such as pectinites, echinites, &c.\r\n\r\nIn making a road, there was discovered an opening, from which a very\r\ncold air issued, which determined the Duke of Saxe-Meinungen to have\r\nit farther examined. A narrow passage, of twenty feet in length, was\r\nfound, which led to a cave of thirty-five feet, having a breadth of\r\nfrom three to twelve, and a height of from six to twelve, according\r\nto the places, and terminated by a large piece of rock, which was\r\nremoved. The labour of two years discovered and cleared a series\r\nof caves connected together, and of which the bottom rose and fell\r\nalternately. They terminate in a place where water flows; but various\r\nlateral fissures make it probable that there are still several caves\r\nwhich have not been opened, and that they perhaps form a sort of\r\nlabyrinth.\r\n\r\nThe bottom and walls of this cave are furnished with the same mud as\r\nthe others, but blacker. The bones were pretty numerous, and tinged\r\nwith the same colour, but only two tolerably entire skulls were\r\nobtained. That of which M. Kocher gives a figure, is the species\r\nof bear named _Ursus spelæus_. There are also caves of this kind\r\nin Westphalia. J. Es Silberschlag, in the _Mem. des Naturalistes_\r\nof Berlin (_Schriften_, vol. vi. p. 132), describes the one called\r\n_Kluter-hœhle_, near the village of _Oldenforde_, in the county of\r\n_Mark_, on the edge of the _Milspe_ and _Ennepe_, two streams which\r\nfall into the Ruhr, and with it into the Rhine. Its entrance is\r\nabout half-way up a hill called _Kluterberg_, is only three feet\r\nthree inches high, and faces the south. The cave itself forms a true\r\nlabyrinth in the interior of the mountain.\r\n\r\nNot far from this, in the same county, at Sundwich, two leagues from\r\n_Iserlohn_, is another cave, which, for about twenty-five years back,\r\nhas furnished a very large quantity of bones, part of which has been\r\ncarried to Berlin, and the rest has remained in the country in the\r\nhands of various individuals[435].\r\n\r\nIf we cast a glance upon a general map, it is not difficult to\r\nperceive a certain continuity in the mountains in which these\r\nsingular caves occur. The Carpathians join with the mountains of\r\nMoravia and those of Bohemia called _Bœhmerwald_, to separate the\r\nbasin of the Danube, from those of the Vistula, Oder and Elbe. The\r\nFichtelgebirge separates the basin of the Elbe from that of the\r\nRhine. The Thuringerwald and the Hartz continue to limit the basin of\r\nthe Elbe, by separating it from that of the Weser.\r\n\r\nThese different chains have but slight intervals between them. The\r\ncaves of Westphalia alone are not connected in so evident a manner\r\nwith the others.\r\n\r\nVery lately, bones have been discovered in a cavern, which extends\r\nmore towards the south, and is even situate on the other or Italian\r\nside of the Alps. It is that of _Adelsberg_ in _Carniola_, a place\r\nsituate on the great road from _Laybach_ to _Trieste_, and about half\r\nway between these two cities. The whole of this country is full of\r\ncaverns and grottoes, which have given rise to numerous sinkings of\r\nthe surface, thus giving a very singular appearance to the country.\r\nSeveral of these caverns have long been celebrated among naturalists.\r\nThat of _Adelsberg_ is generally visited by travellers, on account of\r\nits being near the highway, and because a river called the _Piuka_\r\nor _Poike_ is lost there, forming a subterranean lake, and emerging\r\nagain on the north side, under the name of _Unz_. A hole which the\r\nChevalier de _Lowengreif_ discovered in 1816, in one of its walls, at\r\nthe height of 14 fathoms, conducted him to a series of new caves of\r\nvast extent, and of incomparable beauty, from the lustre and variety\r\nof their stalactites.\r\n\r\nA part of these caves was, however, known, and must be, or have\r\nbeen accessible, by some other place, for inscriptions were found\r\nin them with dates, from 1393 to 1676, together with human bones,\r\nand entire carcases, that had been buried there. A German pamphlet\r\nwas published at Trieste, in which are described all the windings\r\nof these subterranean passages, their different halls, their\r\ndomes, their columns, and all the other appearances produced by\r\ntheir stalactites. We shall not follow the author (M. de _Volpi_,\r\nDirector of the School of Commerce and Navigation at Trieste) through\r\nthis immense labyrinth. Let it suffice to say, that this zealous\r\nnaturalist asserts his having proceeded more than three leagues,\r\nalmost in a straight line, and that he was only stopped by a lake\r\nwhich rendered it impossible to go on. It was about two leagues from\r\nthe entrance that he discovered bones of animals, of which he gives\r\nfigures, and which he describes under the name of Palæotheria. He had\r\nthe politeness to communicate to me, says Cuvier, his drawings the\r\nyear before, but it appears my reply did not reach him, for he makes\r\nno mention of it in his book.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, his figures clearly shewed that the bones in\r\nquestion belonged to the great cave-bear. In fact, several of these\r\nbones having been presented to the Congress of Laybach, _Prince\r\nMetternich_, whose enlightened taste for the advancement of knowledge\r\nhas already been of so much service, had the goodness to address them\r\nto Cuvier, who disposed them in the Royal Cabinet, where any one may\r\nsatisfy himself as to their species.\r\n\r\nThere are, without doubt, caves in many other chains, and several\r\nare known in France. Caves occur in Suabia, but no bones have been\r\nfound in them; and, in general, it appears, that, before the last\r\ndiscoveries, and especially that which has been made in Yorkshire,\r\nnone were known but those of Germany and Hungary that were rich in\r\nbones of carnivora. In truth, the rock of _Fouvent_, and which\r\ncontains in one of its cavities bones of hyenas, and at the same time\r\nthose of elephants, rhinoceroses and horses, might be considered as\r\nbelonging to this order of phenomena; but as it was not explored to\r\nany depth, it cannot be certain that it is so.\r\n\r\nThe case is different with the _Kirkdale_ Cavern. It having been\r\nvisited immediately after its discovery by several well informed\r\npersons, and especially by Mr Buckland, every thing has been made\r\nknown with respect to it. It is situated in the East Riding of the\r\ncounty of York, twenty-five miles NNE. of the city of _York_, and\r\nat about the same distance to the west from the sea and the town of\r\nScarborough. The small river of _Hodgebeck_ is lost under ground\r\nin the neighbourhood, much in the same way as the _Piuka_, near\r\n_Adelsberg_. It is placed in one of the limestone hills which form\r\nthe northern boundary of the vale of _Pickering_, the waters of which\r\nfall into the Derwent. Mr Buckland compares the stone to that of the\r\nlast strata of the Alpine limestone, such as are seen near Aigle and\r\nMeillene.\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of the year 1821, that some labourers working\r\nat a quarry, discovered by chance the opening, which was closed by\r\nrubbish, covered over with earth and turf. It is about 100 feet above\r\nthe neighbouring brook. It can be entered to the distance of 150 or\r\n200 feet, but we can only walk erect in some places, on account of\r\nthe stalactites. On its sides there are seen spines of sea-urchins\r\nand other marine remains, incrusted in the mass of the rock; but it\r\nis on the bottom, and there only, that there is found the stratum of\r\nmud, of about a foot thick, stuck full of bones, as at Gaylenreuth.\r\nThis mud, and the bones which it contains, are, in various places,\r\ncovered or penetrated with stalactite, especially near places where\r\nthe rock has lateral fissures.\r\n\r\nThe discovery having acquired much celebrity, a great number of\r\npeople procured bones from it, and placed them in various public\r\ndepots. Specimens have been deposited in the York Institution, that\r\nof Whitby and Bristol, the British Museum, the Museum of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge, and by Mr Young of Whitby, in the College Museum of\r\nEdinburgh; but the finest collection of the bones of Kirkdale was\r\npresented to Cuvier, and by him deposited in the Royal Cabinet in\r\nParis. The greatest number of these bones without comparison, belong\r\nto hyenas of the same species as those of the caverns of Germany;\r\nbut there are also many of other large and small animals, which Mr\r\nBuckland supposes to form twenty-one species. From the pieces which\r\nI have under my eye, says Cuvier, there indisputably occur bones of\r\nthe _elephant_, _hippopotamus_, _horse_, an _ox_ of the size of the\r\ncommon _deer_, _rabbits_, _field-rats_; also bones of some other\r\ncarnivora, namely, of the _tiger_, _wolf_, _fox_, and _weasel_.\r\nAll these bones and teeth are accumulated on the ground, broken\r\nand gnawed, and there are even seen marks of the teeth which have\r\nfractured them. There are even intermixed with them excrements which\r\nhave been recognized as perfectly similar to those of the hyena[436].\r\n\r\nThe hills in which these caverns occur resemble each other in their\r\ncomposition: they are all of limestone, and all produce abundance of\r\nstalactites. These stalactites line the walls, narrow the passages,\r\nand assume a thousand various forms. The bones are nearly in the\r\nsame state in all these caverns: detached, scattered, partly broken,\r\nbut never rolled, and consequently not brought from a distance by\r\nwater; a little lighter and less solid than recent bones, but still\r\nin their true animal nature, very little decomposed, containing much\r\ngelatine, and not at all petrified. A hardened, but still easily\r\nfrangible or pulverisable earth, also containing animal parts, and\r\nsometimes blackish, forms their natural envelope. It is often\r\nimpregnated and covered with a crust of stalactite. A covering of\r\nthe same nature invests the bones in various places, penetrates\r\ntheir natural cavities, and sometimes attaches them to the walls of\r\nthe cavern. This stalactite is often coloured reddish by the animal\r\nearth which is mixed with it. At other times its surface is stained\r\nblack; but it is easy to see that these appearances are caused by\r\nmodern occurrences, and have no immediate connection with the cause\r\nwhich brought the bones into these cavities. We even daily see the\r\nstalactite increasing and enveloping here and there groups of bones\r\nwhich it had formerly respected.\r\n\r\nThis mass of earth, penetrated by animal matter, indiscriminately\r\nenvelopes the bones of all the species; and, if we except some found\r\nat the surface of the ground, and which had been transported there\r\nat much later periods, which may also be distinguished by their\r\nbeing much less decomposed, they must all have been interred in the\r\nsame manner, and by the same causes. In this mass of earth there are\r\nfound, confusedly mingled with the bones (at least in the cave of\r\nGaylenreuth), pieces of a bluish marble, of which all the corners\r\nare rounded and blunted, and which appear to have been rolled. They\r\nsingularly resemble those which form part of the osseous brecciæ of\r\n_Gibraltar_ and _Dalmatia_.\r\n\r\nLastly, what further conspires to render this phenomenon very\r\nstriking, is, that the most remarkable of these bones are the same\r\nin these caverns, over an extent of more than two hundred leagues.\r\nThree-fourths and upwards belong to species of _bears_, which are\r\nnow extinct. A half, or two-thirds of the remaining fourth, belong\r\nto a species of _hyena_, which is equally unknown at the present\r\nday. A smaller number belong to a species of the _tiger_ or _lion_\r\nkind, and to another of the _wolf_ or _dog_ genus; lastly, the most\r\ndiminutive have belonged to various small carnivora, as the _fox_,\r\nthe _polecat_, or at least species very nearly allied to them, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Kirkdale Cavern, however, forms a notable exception, inasmuch as\r\nnone, or very few, bones of bears are found in it, and in its being\r\nthe hyena that appears to predominate among the carnivora.\r\n\r\nThe species so common in the alluvial formations, the _elephants_,\r\n_rhinoceroses_, _horses_, _oxen_ or _aurochs_, and _tapirs_, are\r\nof very rare occurrence in the caves of Germany. There are even\r\nsome in which no one is said to have found them, and the only\r\nbones of herbivora mentioned are remains of deer. In this point\r\nalso, however, the Kirkdale cave differs much from the others,\r\ninasmuch as it abounds almost as much in bones of large and small\r\nherbivora, as in bones of carnivora. All the great pachydermata of\r\nthe alluvial formations are seen in it: the elephants, rhinoceroses\r\nand hippopotami. There are also seen in it bones of oxen, deer, and\r\neven small bones of mice and birds. But there are no bones of marine\r\nanimals of any species, either at Kirkdale or in Germany. Those who\r\nhave pretended that they saw bones of _seals_, _morses_, or other\r\nsimilar species, have been led into error by the hypothesis which\r\nthey had previously adopted.\r\n\r\nThese bones of carnivora, so numerous in the caves, are rare in the\r\ngreat alluvial strata; the hyena alone has been seen in any quantity\r\nat Canstadt, near Aichstedt, and in some other places. There have\r\nalso been found some traces of bears in Tuscany and Austria, but\r\ntheir relative proportion is always infinitely less than in the\r\ncaves; and it is always sufficiently proved by these circumstances,\r\nthat these various animals have lived together in the same countries,\r\nand have belonged to the same epoch.\r\n\r\nCuvier concludes, there can only be imagined three general causes\r\nwhich might have placed these bones in such quantity in these vast\r\nsubterranean cavities. Either they are the remains of animals\r\nwhich inhabited these abodes, and which died peaceably there; or\r\ninundations and other violent causes have carried them into these\r\ncavities; or, lastly, they had been enveloped in rocky strata, the\r\ndissolution of which produced these caverns, and they have not been\r\ndissolved by the agent which carried off the matter of the strata.\r\n\r\nThis last cause is refuted by the fact, that the strata in which the\r\ncaves occur contain no bones; and the second by the entireness of\r\nthe smallest prominences of the bones, which does not permit us to\r\nthink that they had been rolled; for if some bones are worn, as Mr\r\nBuckland has remarked, they are only so on one side, which would only\r\nprove that some current has passed over them, and in the deposit in\r\nwhich they are. We are, therefore, obliged to have recourse to the\r\nfirst supposition, whatever difficulties it presents on its part, and\r\nto say that these caves served as a retreat to carnivorous animals,\r\nand that these carried there, for the purpose of devouring them, the\r\nanimals which formed their prey, or the parts of these animals.\r\n\r\nMr Buckland has observed, that the hyena bones are not less broken\r\nand splintered than those of the herbivorous animals; from which he\r\nconcludes, that the hyenas had devoured the dead bodies of their own\r\nspecies, as those of the present day still do.\r\n\r\nThese animals attack each other during their life; for the fossil\r\nhead of a hyena is preserved, which had evidently been wounded and\r\nafterwards healed[437].\r\n\r\nThis supposition is moreover confirmed by the animal nature of the\r\nearth in which these bones are found[438].\r\n\r\nThis much is certain, that the establishment of these animals in the\r\ncaves has taken place at a much later epoch than that at which the\r\ngreat rocky strata have been formed, not only those which compose\r\nthe mountains in which the caves are situated, but the strata of\r\nmuch newer origin. No permanent inundation has penetrated into the\r\nsubterranean dens, and formed a regular rocky deposit. The mud\r\narising from the proper decomposition of these animals, and the\r\nstalactites that have been filtered through the wall of the caves,\r\nare the only matters which cover these remains, and these stalactites\r\nincrease so rapidly, that M. Goldfuss already found a layer of them\r\ncovering the names of MM. Esper and Rosenmüller, whose visits did\r\nnot date thirty years before his own. The rolled stones that are met\r\nwith, and the marks of detrition observed on some bones, announce, at\r\nthe very utmost, but passing currents.\r\n\r\nBut how have so many ferocious animals which peopled our forests\r\nbeen extirpated? All the reply we can make is, that they must have\r\nbeen destroyed at the same time, and by the same cause, as the large\r\nherbivora, which, like them, also peopled these forests, and of which\r\nno traces remain at the present day any more than of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE CAVE CONTAINING BONES AT ADELSBERG IN CARNIOLA.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of the cave, slightly noticed at\r\npages 524 and 525, is extracted from a memoir by M. Bertrand Geslin,\r\nMember of the Natural History Society of Paris, published in the\r\nnumber of the _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_ for April 1826.\r\n\r\n  M. Cuvier, says Gesler, speaking of the Adelsberg Cave, from the\r\n  account published by M. Volpi of Trieste, says, that it was nearly\r\n  two leagues from the entrance where he discovered bones of animals.\r\n\r\n  Having visited this cave myself, I am obliged to say that M.\r\n  Volpi’s assertion as to this matter is not very correct. On my way\r\n  to Trieste, in July 1823, before going to Adelsberg, I had the\r\n  advantage of seeing M. Volpi. In shewing me the bones collected\r\n  by him at Adelsberg, he also assured me that they were found two\r\n  leagues from the entrance of the cave, and only in a very compact\r\n  block of several cubic feet, from which it was not possible to\r\n  procure more, as he had taken all that he could easily remove.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding this discouraging account, I betook myself to\r\n  Adelsberg, in order to see a sample of those immense caverns of\r\n  secondary limestone. The entrance of the cave is situated in a\r\n  white compact secondary limestone, lying in great beds inclined\r\n  to the south-west, at an angle of from 30 to 35 degrees. At fifty\r\n  paces from the entrance, we find ourselves as in a large apartment,\r\n  which crosses the torrent of the Pinka. After passing to the left\r\n  bank of this torrent, we enter a rather low and not long passage,\r\n  which leads to a second apartment of an elongated form. It is here\r\n  that the line of chambers truly commences. They are of large but\r\n  variable dimensions, and are situated nearly upon a horizontal\r\n  plane.\r\n\r\n  On entering this second chamber, I saw that the ground was formed\r\n  of a yellow and reddish clayey mud, from one to two feet thick,\r\n  and more or less impregnated and covered with crusts of yellow\r\n  stalagmites. In the places where it offered little resistance, I\r\n  dug it up with the point of my hammer, and was fortunate enough to\r\n  disunite some fragments of bone, although, from what had been said\r\n  to me, I ought not to have expected to find them. From this I was\r\n  convinced, that if M. Volpi had only found bones at a distance of\r\n  two leagues from the entrance, it was because he had not been at\r\n  the trouble to search for them nearer. I fell to work with more\r\n  ardour, and succeeded in digging up some in good preservation,\r\n  such as radii, cubiti, femora, humeri, fragments of jaws, calcarea,\r\n  toes, vertebræ, &c., belonging to bears of different sizes, of the\r\n  species termed _Ursus spelæus_. It would appear that the hyena\r\n  tribe is rather rare here, for I only procured a single bone\r\n  belonging to it. It was particularly in two small lateral chambers,\r\n  near the narrow passage, that I obtained a great quantity of these\r\n  bones, the clay there having been dug up by the guides, in order to\r\n  make the floor of the great apartment even with it.\r\n\r\n  I continued to dig as I advanced, and everywhere found bones more\r\n  or less broken and enveloped in the clayey mud. After proceeding\r\n  for half an hour, I fell in with a mass, in an apartment of\r\n  considerable dimensions, which was of a conical form, and composed\r\n  of blocks of compact white limestone, of all sizes, mixed with\r\n  yellowish clayey mud. These blocks had their edges as sharp as if\r\n  they had only been lately broken. The mass, which reached to the\r\n  right wall of the cave, might be fifteen feet in height, and twenty\r\n  in diameter at its base: it was covered with stalactite in several\r\n  places. It was in this mass, at about ten feet above the floor of\r\n  the cave, in the clayey mud that filled up the interstices between\r\n  the blocks, that I found the entire skeleton of a young bear, in a\r\n  space of two square feet at most. The bones which I dug out were\r\n  the frontal part of the head, the lower jaw of the left side,\r\n  the seventh cervical and eighth dorsal vertebræ; the eighth and\r\n  fourteenth ribs of the right side; two tibia, femora, and cubiti,\r\n  and two large canine teeth of another bear. If I could have raised\r\n  up the limestone blocks, between which these bones lay, I might\r\n  without doubt have procured a great part of this skeleton. There\r\n  are still found here and there in the cave some small heaps of\r\n  clayey mud, with fragments of white secondary limestone, as well\r\n  as large isolated limestone blocks, which the guides are daily\r\n  destroying, to make the floor even for the convenience of visitors.\r\n\r\n  I had only advanced an hour and a quarter’s progress into the cave,\r\n  always finding bones, when the oil of my lamps beginning to fail, I\r\n  was obliged to return without reaching the block in which M. Volpi\r\n  had found the first bones. This block is without doubt owing to the\r\n  same causes as the heap of which I have spoken above.\r\n\r\n  The manner in which these heaps exist, being composed of blocks of\r\n  compact white secondary limestone, similar to that which forms the\r\n  walls of the cave, with sharp edges, and piled upon each other,\r\n  made me imagine that they might have fallen from the roof. As I\r\n  returned, I examined the ceiling of the vaults with attention. As\r\n  it was all covered over with stalactites, I could not discover any\r\n  fissure.\r\n\r\n  From this short excursion in the Adelsberg cave, I am induced\r\n  to believe, that the bones exist along the whole extent of the\r\n  cave, and that they occur in two different ways; _1st_, scattered\r\n  in the clayey mud which forms the floor of the chambers; and,\r\n  _2dly_, buried in heaps formed of blocks of white secondary compact\r\n  limestone, and yellow clayey mud.\r\n\r\n  The hypothesis which M. Cuvier admits as the most probable for\r\n  explaining the presence of these bones in the caves, is that which\r\n  would make these caves to have served as a retreat to carnivorous\r\n  animals.\r\n\r\n  The presence of bones in the clayey mud of the floor of the\r\n  Adelsberg cave accords well with this hypothesis; but the case\r\n  is different with those which I found in the heaps of limestone\r\n  blocks and clayey mud. The bones are not at the surface of the\r\n  heap, but rather towards its middle part, buried among the blocks,\r\n  and crushed by them. From this position, and the height at which\r\n  the skeleton mentioned above occurs from the floor of the cave,\r\n  it cannot be supposed that it formed part of the bones with which\r\n  the bottom of the cave is strewed, nor that the blocks had fallen\r\n  upon it. The bones contained in the heap in question must have been\r\n  brought into their present position at the same time, and by the\r\n  same cause as the limestone blocks. They could not, therefore, have\r\n  belonged to animals which inhabited these caves, and died there\r\n  peaceably.\r\n\r\n  If it be remarked, that these blocks, which are sometimes very\r\n  large, heaped up above one another, and mixed with clayey mud, have\r\n  their angles perfectly fresh, and are of the same nature as the\r\n  limestone of the walls of the cave, it cannot be admitted that they\r\n  have been brought from a distance. This mode of arrangement could\r\n  only have been produced by their falling from the roof of the cave.\r\n\r\n  The following facts also give support to this opinion. In the cave\r\n  of Gaylenreuth, a fissure of the third grotto, was the means, in\r\n  1784, of disclosing a new one, fifteen feet long and four broad,\r\n  where the greatest quantity of hyena or lion bones were found.\r\n  _The aperture was much too small for these animals to have passed\r\n  through it._\r\n\r\n  In a cave discovered in 1824, in the district of Lanark in Upper\r\n  Canada, Mr Bigsby observed, that the floor was covered with debris\r\n  of brown granular limestone, similar to that of the walls, and\r\n  that the bones especially formed a heap there. He thinks that the\r\n  animal, whose bones have been found in this cave, was much too\r\n  large to have got into it alive or entire.--_Silliman’s Journal,\r\n  June 1825_, p. 354.\r\n\r\n  It must therefore be also admitted here, either that the bones\r\n  could only have got into the cave in the same manner as the heaps\r\n  of blocks found in the Adelsberg cave; that is to say, by falling\r\n  from the roof, or that the apertures have been closed since the\r\n  period at which the animals were buried.\r\n\r\n  If it be now considered, _1st_, That the surface of the secondary\r\n  limestone mountains of Carniola is covered with a layer of reddish\r\n  clay; and, _2dly_, That the clayey mud of the heap in the Adelsberg\r\n  cave is mineralogically the same as that which forms the floor\r\n  of the cave; may it not be supposed, that the same catastrophe\r\n  which produced the heaps in the cave may have, at the same time,\r\n  introduced into it the reddish clayey mud of the surface, which, by\r\n  extending itself over the floor of the cave, would have contributed\r\n  to cover the bones that were lying there?\r\n\r\n  Moreover, may it not have been the case, that, after the caves\r\n  had been inhabited by the carnivorous animals, the substances\r\n  falling from above, and coming from the surface of the soil, may\r\n  have carried along with the clayey mud and the bones of bears, the\r\n  spoils of large herbivorous animals, which they may have met with,\r\n  and which cannot be supposed to have sought refuge in these caves\r\n  during life.\r\n\r\n  There will, no doubt, be objected to me, that opinion which\r\n  maintains, that the bones of herbivora have been dragged into the\r\n  caves by the carnivorous animals. This might certainly have been\r\n  the case with regard to small species, but it is not probable that\r\n  the bones of large species could have been introduced in the same\r\n  manner.\r\n\r\n  Admitting as certain, at least with regard to the Adelsberg cave,\r\n  that the limestone blocks and the bear bones which accompany them,\r\n  have fallen from the ceiling, the phenomenon of caves containing\r\n  bones would connect itself pretty well with that of osseous brecciæ\r\n  in a geological point of view. As M. Cuvier observes, “The nature\r\n  of the rocks which contains the one and the other is not very\r\n  different; and, besides, the fissures of caves being generally\r\n  pretty wide, the bones would not have stuck, but would have fallen\r\n  to the bottom, while those of the osseous brecciæ being much\r\n  narrower, and not so deep, would have retained the bones at no\r\n  great distance from the surface of the soil.”\r\n\r\n  Thus, from the facts observed in the caves of Germany and England,\r\n  and from that of the Adelsberg cave, which I have described above,\r\n  we may conclude, _1st_, That the presence of bones in caves has\r\n  been produced at two different periods, which, without doubt, have\r\n  not been very distant from each other; the first, that when the\r\n  animals inhabited these caves; the other, that when they had been\r\n  transported there by a somewhat general catastrophe; _2dly_, That\r\n  the second epoch was contemporaneous with the osseous brecciæ, and\r\n  was produced, like them, by a phenomenon or process of filling up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nThe GENERA of FOSSIL MAMMIFERA, CETACEA, AVES, REPTILIA, and

geologists, that certain strata\r\nhave been formed in the inclined position in which they are now\r\nfound, admitting it true with regard to some particular strata\r\nwhich might have been crystallized, as Mr Greenough supposes, like\r\nthe deposit which encrusts the inside of vessels, in which water\r\ncontaining gypsum has been boiled, cannot at least apply to those\r\nwhich contain shells or rolled stones, which could not have waited,\r\nso suspended, the formation of the cement by which they were to be\r\nagglutinated.\r\n\r\n[4] See Note C.\r\n\r\n[5] The conjecture of the Marquis de la Place, that the materials of\r\nwhich the globe is composed, have perhaps existed at first in the\r\nelastic form, and have successively assumed a liquid consistence on\r\ncooling, and have at length been solidified, is well supported by the\r\nrecent experiments of M. Mitscherlich, who has composed, of all sorts\r\nof substances, and crystallized by the heat of intense furnaces,\r\nseveral of the mineral species which enter into the composition of\r\nprimitive mountains.--Note D.\r\n\r\n[6] The Travels of Saussure and Deluc present a multitude of facts\r\nof this description. These geologists imagined, that they could\r\nonly have been produced by enormous eruptions. De Buch and Escher\r\nhave recently employed themselves upon this subject. The memoir of\r\nthe latter, inserted in the Nouvelle Alpina of Steinmüller, vol. i.\r\npresents the general results in a remarkable manner. The following is\r\na comprehensive view of them: Such of these blocks as are scattered\r\nover the low parts of Switzerland and Lombardy, come from the Alps,\r\nand have descended along their valleys. They occur every where, and\r\nof all sizes, up to 50,000 cubic feet, over the great extent of\r\ncountry which separates the Alps from the Jura mountains; and they\r\nrise upon the sides of the latter facing the Alps, to a height of\r\n4000 feet above the level of the sea. They are found at the surface,\r\nor in the superficial layers of debris, but not in the strata of\r\nsandstone, molasse, or conglomerate, which fill up almost every where\r\nthe interval in question. They are sometimes isolated, sometimes in\r\nheaps. The height of their situation is not connected with their\r\nmagnitude; the smaller ones alone appear sometimes a little worn, but\r\nthe large ones are not so at all. Those which belong to the basin of\r\neach river are found, upon examination, to be of the same nature as\r\nthe mountains of the tops or sides of the high valleys in which the\r\ntributary streams of this river take their rise. They are already\r\nseen in these upper valleys, and are particularly accumulated at the\r\nplaces which are situated above some of the contractions of these\r\nvalleys. They have passed over the lower hills, when their height\r\nhas not been more than 4000 feet; and then they are seen upon the\r\nother side of the ridges, in the cantons between the Alps and Jura,\r\nand even upon the latter itself. It is opposite the mouths of the\r\nvalleys of the Alps that they are seen in the greatest quantity, and\r\nat the greatest heights; those of the intervening spaces have not\r\nbeen carried so high. Among the chains of the Jura mountains, which\r\nare more remote from the Alps, they are only found in places which\r\nare opposite the openings of the nearer chains.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, the author draws the conclusion, that the\r\ntransportation of these blocks has taken place at a period subsequent\r\nto the deposition of the sandstones and conglomerates, and has\r\nperhaps been occasioned by the last of the revolutions which the\r\nglobe has experienced. He compares the transportation in question to\r\nthat which still takes place from the agency of torrents; but the\r\nobjections presented by the consideration of the great size of the\r\nblocks, and the deep valleys over which they must have passed, appear\r\nto us to militate greatly against this part of his hypothesis.--Note\r\nE.\r\n\r\n[7] Regarding the changes of the surface of the earth, known from\r\nhistory or tradition, and consequently dependent on causes still in\r\noperation, see the German work of M. de Hof, entitled “Geschichte der\r\nNatürlichen Veränderungen der Erdoberfläche,” 2 vols. 8vo. Goth. 1822\r\nand 1824. The facts contained in it are collected with equal care and\r\nerudition.\r\n\r\n[8] Note F.\r\n\r\n[9] Note G.\r\n\r\n[10] Voyage aux Terres Australes, t. i. p. 161.\r\n\r\n[11] Note H.\r\n\r\n[12] It is a common opinion in Sweden, that the level of the sea is\r\nbecoming lower, and that many places may even be forded or passed\r\ndry-shod, which were formerly impracticable. Eminent philosophers\r\nhave adopted this popular opinion; and M. von Buch goes so far as\r\nto suppose that the whole of Sweden is gradually rising. But it is\r\nsingular, that no one has made, or at least published, a series of\r\naccurate observations, calculated to confirm a fact that had been\r\nannounced so long ago, and which would leave no doubt upon the mind,\r\nif, as Linnæus asserts, this difference of level were so much as four\r\nor five feet yearly. Note I.\r\n\r\n[13] Mr Stevenson, in his observations upon the bed of the German\r\nOcean and British Channel, maintains that the level of the sea is\r\ncontinually rising, and has been very sensibly elevated within the\r\nlast three centuries. Fortis asserts the same of some parts of\r\nthe Adriatic sea. But the example of the Temple of Serapis, near\r\nPouzzola, proves that the margins of that sea are, in many places,\r\nof such a nature as to be subject to local risings and fallings. On\r\nthe other hand, there are thousands of quays, roads, and other works,\r\nmade along the sea-side by the Romans, from Alexandria to Belgium,\r\nthe relative level of which has never varied. Note K.\r\n\r\n[14] When I formerly mentioned this circumstance of the science of\r\ngeology having become ridiculous, I only expressed a fact, to the\r\ntruth of which every day bears witness; but in this I did not profess\r\nto give my own opinion, as some respectable geologists seem to have\r\nbelieved. If their mistake has arisen from any thing equivocal in my\r\nexpressions, I here apologize to them.\r\n\r\n[15] Burnet, Telluris Theoria Sacra.

It was probably from seeing some similar\r\nindividual that the character in question was attributed to all\r\nhyenas. This animal ought to be more subject than any other to such\r\nan accident, on account of the prodigious power of the muscles of its\r\nneck, and the frequent use which it makes of them. When the hyena has\r\nlaid hold of any thing, it is easier to drag it along by it than to\r\nwrest it from its jaws; and it is this circumstance which has caused\r\nthe Arabs to consider it as the emblem of invincible obstinacy.\r\n\r\n[68] It does not in reality change its sex, but it has an orifice in\r\nthe perineum, which might make it be supposed to be hermaphrodite.\r\n\r\n[69] Arist.

Frederick Cuvier’s memoir upon the varieties of dogs, in\r\nthe Annales du Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, which he drew up at the\r\nrequest of Professor Cuvier, from a series of skeletons of all the\r\nvarieties of the dog prepared in the Professor’s collection.\r\n\r\n[83] The first figure made of it from nature is in the Description\r\nde la Menagerie, a work composed by M. Cuvier. It is seen perfectly\r\nrepresented in the great work on Egypt.--Antiq. t. iv. pl. xlix.\r\n\r\n[84] See the Journal de Marseille et des Bouches-du-Rhône, of the\r\n27th Sept. 25th Oct. and 1st Nov. 1820.\r\n\r\n[85] I am confirmed in this opinion by the sketches transmitted to me\r\nby M. Cottard, one of the Professors of the College of Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[86] These skeletons, more or less mutilated, are found near Port\r\nde Moule, on the north-west coast of the mainland of Guadaloupe, in\r\na kind of slope resting against the steep edges of the island. This\r\nslope is, in a great measure, covered by the sea at high-water, and\r\nis nothing else than a tufa, formed, and daily augmented, by the very\r\nsmall debris of shells and corals, which the waves detach from the\r\nrocks, and the accumulated mass of which assumes a great degree of\r\ncohesion in the places that are most frequently left dry. We find, on\r\nexamining them with a lens, that several of these fragments have the\r\nsame red tint as a part of the corals contained in the reefs of the\r\nisland. Formations of this kind are common in the whole archipelago\r\nof the Antilles, where they are known to the Negroes under the name\r\nof _Maçonne-bon-dieu_. Their augmentation is proportioned to the\r\nviolence of the surge. They have extended the plain of the Cayes\r\nto St Domingo, the situation of which has some resemblance to the\r\nPlage du Moule, and there are sometimes found in it fragments of\r\nearthen vessels, and of other articles of human fabrication, at a\r\ndepth of twenty feet. A thousand conjectures have been made, and\r\neven events imagined, to account for these skeletons of Guadaloupe.\r\nBut, from all the circumstances of the case, M. Moreau de Jonnès,\r\ncorrespondent of the Academy of Sciences, who has been upon the spot,\r\nand to whom I am indebted for the above details, thinks that they are\r\nmerely bodies of persons that have perished by shipwreck. They were\r\ndiscovered in 1805 by M. Manuel Cortès y Campomanès, at that time a\r\ngeneral officer in the service of the colony. General Ernouf, the\r\ngovernor, caused one to be extracted with much labour, of which the\r\nhead, and almost the whole superior extremities, were wanting. This\r\nhad been deposited at Guadaloupe, in the expectation that another\r\nand more complete specimen would be procured, in order to send them\r\ntogether to Paris, when the island was taken by the English. Admiral\r\nCochrane having found this skeleton at the headquarters, sent it to\r\nthe English Admiralty, who presented it to the British Museum. It is\r\nstill in that collection, and M. Kœnig, Keeper of the Mineralogical\r\nDepartment, has described it in the Phil. Trans. of 1814, and there\r\nI saw it in 1818. M. Kœnig observes, that the stone in which it is\r\nimbedded, has not been cut to its present shape, but that it seems to\r\nhave been simply inserted, in the form of a distinct nodule, into the\r\nsurrounding mass. The skeleton is so superficial, that its presence\r\nmust have been perceived by the projection of some of its bones.\r\nThey still contain some of their animal matter, and the whole of\r\ntheir phosphate of lime. The rock being entirely formed of pieces of\r\ncorals, and of compact limestone, readily dissolves in nitric acid.\r\nM. Kœnig has detected fragments of _Millepora miniacea_, of several\r\nmadrepores, and of shells, which he compares to _Helix acuta_ and\r\n_Turbo pica_. This fossil skeleton is represented in Plate I. More\r\nrecently, General Donzelot has caused another of these skeletons\r\nto be extracted, which is now in the Royal Cabinet, and of which a\r\nfigure is given in Plate II. It is a body which has the knees bent.\r\nA small portion of the upper jaw, the left half of the lower, nearly\r\nthe whole of one side of the trunk and pelvis, and a large portion of\r\nthe left upper and lower extremities, are what remain of it. The rock\r\nwhich contains it, is evidently a travertin, in which are imbedded\r\nshells of the neighbouring sea, and land-shells, which are still\r\nfound alive in the island, namely, the _Bulimus guadalupensis_ of\r\nFerussac.\r\n\r\n[87] See M. de Schlotheim’s Treatise on Petrifactions, Gotha, 1820,\r\np. 57; and his Letter in the Isis of 1820, 8th Number, No. 6. of\r\nSupplement.\r\n\r\n[88] It is perhaps proper that I take notice of those fragments of\r\nsandstone, regarding which some noise was attempted to be made last\r\nyear (1824), and in which a man and a horse were alleged to have\r\nbeen found petrified. The mere circumstance of its being a man and\r\na horse, with their flesh and skin, that these fragments must have\r\nrepresented, might have enabled every one to perceive that the whole\r\nwas a mere _lusus naturæ_, and not a true petrifaction.--Note L.\r\n\r\n[89] Fourcroy has given an analysis of them in the Annales du Museum,\r\nvol. x. p. 1.\r\n\r\n[90] Journal de Physique, t. xlii, p. 40. _et seq._\r\n\r\n[91] Herod.

But it is very obvious, that, if this diminution\r\nhad arisen from the rupture of the Bosphorus, it would necessarily\r\nhave been completed long before the time of Herodotus, and even at\r\nthe period at which Deucalion is supposed to have lived.\r\n\r\n[102] See the Geography of Herodotus by M. Rennel, p. 56. _et seq._;\r\nand the Physical Geography of the Black Sea, &c. by M. Dureau de\r\nLamalle. There is only at present the small river of Kamennoipost,\r\nthat could represent the Gerrhus and Hypacyris, such as they are\r\ndescribed by Herodotus.\r\n\r\nM. Dureau, p. 170, supposes Herodotus to have made the Borysthenes\r\nand Hypanis discharge themselves into the Palus Mæotis; but Herodotus\r\n(in Melpom. liii.) only says that these two rivers fall together\r\ninto the same lake, that is, into the Liman, as at the present day.\r\nHerodotus does not carry the Gerrhus and Hypacyris any farther.\r\n\r\n[103] For example, M. Dureau de Lamalle, in his Physical Geography\r\nof the Black Sea, quotes Aristotle (Meteor. lib. i. cap. 13.) as\r\n“apprising us, that, in his time, there still existed several ancient\r\nperiods and peripli, attesting that there had been a canal leading\r\nfrom the Caspian Sea into the Palus Mæotis.” Now, Aristotle’s words\r\nat the place mentioned (Duval’s edition, i. 545. B.) are merely\r\nthese: “From the Paropamisus, descend, among other rivers, the\r\nBactrus, the Choaspes, and the Araxis, from which the Tanais, which\r\nis a branch of it, takes its origin, into the Palus Mæotis.” Who does\r\nnot see that this nonsense, which is neither founded upon peripli\r\nnor periods, is nothing else than the strange idea of Alexander’s\r\nsoldiers, who took the Jaxartes or Tanais of the Transoxian for the\r\nDon or Tanais of Scythia? Arrian and Pliny distinguish these two\r\nrivers from each other, but the distinction does not appear to have\r\nbeen made in the time of Aristotle. How, then, could such geographers\r\nas these furnish us with geological documents?\r\n\r\n[104] See the Report upon the Downs of the Gulf of Gascony (or Bay of\r\nBiscay) by M. Tassin.--Mont. de-Marsan, an x.\r\n\r\n[105] Memoir on the means of fixing Downs, by M. Bremontier.\r\n\r\n[106] Report of M. Tassin, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n[107] See M.

Deluc’s\r\nLetters to the Queen of England, in the parts where he describes\r\nthe peat-mosses of Westphalia; and in his Letters to Lametherie,\r\ninserted in the Journal de Physique for 1791, &c. as well as in those\r\nwhich he has addressed to Blumenbach. We may refer also to the very\r\ninteresting details which are given in note F, respecting the islands\r\nof the west coast of the Duchy of Sleswick, and the manner in which\r\nthey have been joined, whether to one another, or to the continent,\r\nby alluvial depositions and peat-mosses, as well as respecting the\r\nirruptions of the sea which from time to time have destroyed or\r\nseparated some of their parts.\r\n\r\n[111] The period of Cyrus, about 650 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[112] The period of Ninus, about 2348 years before Christ, according\r\nto Ctesias, and those who have followed him; but only 1250, according\r\nto Volney, after Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[113] Herodotus lived 440 years before Christ.\r\n\r\n[114] Cadmus, Pherecydes, Aristæus of Proconnesus, Acusilaus,\r\nHecatæus of Miletum, Charon of Lampsacus, &c.

Thus,\r\naccording to the calculations of Usserius, Cecrops came from Egypt to\r\nAthens about 1556 years before Christ; Deucalion settled on Parnassus\r\nabout 1548; Cadmus arrived from Phenicia at Thebes about 1493; Danaus\r\ncame to Argos about 1485; and Dardanus established himself on the\r\nHellespont about 1449. All these founders of nations must therefore\r\nhave been nearly contemporary with Moses, whose migration took place\r\nin 1491. Consult further, regarding the synchronism of Moses, Danaus\r\nand Cadmus, _Diodorus_, lib. xi; in Photius, p. 1152.\r\n\r\n[118] The genealogies of Apollodorus are generally known, and that\r\nportion of them upon which Clavier endeavoured to establish a sort of\r\nprimitive history of Greece; but, when we become acquainted with the\r\ngenealogies of the Arabs, those of the Tartars, and all those which\r\nour old chronicling monks invented for the different sovereigns of\r\nEurope, and even for individuals, we readily comprehend that Greek\r\nwriters must have done for the early periods of their nation what has\r\nbeen done for all the other nations, at periods when criticism had\r\nnot been used to throw light upon history.\r\n\r\n[119] 1856 or 1823 years before Christ, or other dates still, but\r\nalways about 350 years before the principal Phœnician or Egyptian\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n[120] The common date of Ogyges, according to Acusilaus, followed by\r\nEusebius, is 1796 years before Christ, consequently several years\r\nafter Inachus.\r\n\r\n[121] Varro places the deluge of Ogyges, which he calls the _first\r\ndeluge_, 400 years before Inachus, and consequently 1600 years\r\nbefore the first Olympiad. This would refer it to a period of 2376\r\nyears before Christ; and the deluge of Noah, according to the\r\nHebrew text, is 2349, there being only 27 years of difference. This\r\ntestimony of Varro is mentioned by Censorinus, _De Die Natali_,\r\ncap. xxi. In reality, Censorinus wrote only 238 years after Christ;\r\nand, it appears, from Julius Africanus, _ap. Euseb._ Præp. cv. that\r\nAcusilaus, the first author who placed a deluge in the reign of\r\nOgyges, made this prince cotemporary with Phoronæus, which would have\r\nbrought him very near the first Olympiad. Julius Africanus makes only\r\nan interval of 1020 years between the two epochs; and there is even\r\na passage in Censorinus conformable to this opinion. Some also read\r\n_erogitium_ in place of _ogygium_, in the passage of Varro, which\r\nwe have quoted above from Censorinus. But what would this be but an\r\nErogitian Cataclysm, of which nobody has ever heard?\r\n\r\n[122] Neither Homer nor Hesiod knew any thing of the deluge of\r\nDeucalion, any more than that of Ogyges. The first author, whose\r\nworks are extant, by whom mention is made of the former, is Pindar\r\n(Od. Olymp. ix.) He speaks of Deucalion as landing upon Parnassus,\r\nestablishing himself in the city of Protogene (first growth or\r\nbirth), and re-creating his people from stones; in a word, he\r\nrelates, but confining it to a single nation only, the fable\r\nafterwards generalized by Ovid, and applied to the whole human race.\r\nThe first historians who wrote after Pindar, namely, Herodotus,\r\nThucydides, and Xenophon, make no mention of any deluge, whether of\r\nthe time of Ogyges, or that of Deucalion, although they speak of the\r\nlatter as one of the first kings of the Hellenes.\r\n\r\nPlato, in his Timæus, says only a few words of the deluge, as well\r\nas of Deucalion and Pyrrha, in order to commence the recital of the\r\ngreat catastrophe, which, according to the priests of Sais, destroyed\r\nthe Atlantis; but, in these few words, he speaks of the deluge in the\r\nsingular number, as if it had been the only one. He even expressly\r\nmentions farther on, that the Greeks knew only one. He places the\r\nname of Deucalion immediately after that of Phoroneus, the first of\r\nthe human race, without making mention of Ogyges. Thus, with him, it\r\nis still a general event, a true universal deluge, and the only one\r\nwhich had happened. He regards it, therefore, as identical with that\r\nof Ogyges.\r\n\r\nAristotle (Meteor. i. 14.) seems to be the first who considered this\r\ndeluge only as a local inundation, which he places near Dodona and\r\nthe river Achelous, but near the Achelous and Dodona of Thessaly.\r\nApollodorus (Bibl. i. § 7.) restores to the deluge of Deucalion all\r\nits grandeur and mythological character. According to him, it took\r\nplace at the period when the age of brass was passing into the age\r\nof iron. Deucalion is the son of Titan Prometheus, the fabricator\r\nof man; he forms anew the human race of stones; and yet Atlas, his\r\nuncle, Phoroneus, who lived before him, and several other personages\r\nanterior to him, preserve a lengthened posterity.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as we advance toward authors who approach nearer our\r\nown times, we find circumstances of detail added, which more resemble\r\nthose related by Moses. Thus Apollodorus gives Deucalion a great\r\nchest as a means of safety; Plutarch speaks of the pigeons by which\r\nhe sought to find out whether the waters had retired; and Lucian, of\r\nthe animals of every kind which he had taken with him, &c.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the blending of traditions and hypotheses, by which\r\nit has recently been tried to infer the conclusion, that the rupture\r\nof the Thracian Bosphorus was the cause of Deucalion’s deluge,\r\nand even of the opening of the pillars of Hercules, by making the\r\nwaters of the Euxine Sea discharge themselves into the Archipelago,\r\nsupposing them to have been much higher and more extended than they\r\nhave been since that event, it is not necessary for us to treat of\r\nit in detail, since it has been determined by the observations of M.\r\nOlivier, that if the Black Sea had been as high as it is imagined\r\nto have been, it would have found several passages for its waters,\r\nby hills and plains less elevated than the present banks of the\r\nBosphorus; and by those of the Count Andreossy, that had it one day\r\nfallen suddenly in the manner of a cascade by this new passage,\r\nthe small quantity of water that could have flowed at once through\r\nso narrow an aperture, would not only be diffused over the immense\r\nextent of the Mediterranean, without occasioning a tide of a few\r\nfathoms, but that the mere natural inclination necessary for the\r\nflowing of the waters, would have reduced to nothing their excess of\r\nheight above the shores of Attica.\r\n\r\nSee further on this subject the note that I have published at the\r\nhead of the third volume of Ovid, of M. Lemaire’s collection.\r\n\r\n[123] Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiq.

It should not be forgotten, that many\r\nancient authors thought that the Egyptian institutions came from\r\nEthiopia; and that Syncellus, p. 151. says positively that the\r\nEthiopians came from the banks of the Indus in the time of King\r\nAmenophtis.\r\n\r\n[129] See Polier.

His father Garga had\r\nfor one of his surnames _Pramathesa_ (Prometheus); and, according\r\nto another legend, he was devoured by the eagle Garuda. These\r\nparticulars have been extracted by Mr Wilfort (in his Memoir upon\r\nMount Caucasus, Calcutta Memoirs, vol. vi. p. 507, 8vo edition),\r\nfrom the Sanscrit drama, entitled Hari-Vansa. Mr Charles Ritter, in\r\nhis Vestibule of the History of Europe before Herodotus, concludes\r\nthat the whole fable of Deucalion was of foreign origin, and had\r\nbeen brought into Greece along with the other legends of that part\r\nof the Grecian worship which had come from the north, and which had\r\npreceded the Egyptian and Phenician colonies.

He afterwards brought me a very rare and\r\ncurious book, in Sanscrit, in which there was a particular chapter\r\non the Upanacshatras, or extra-zodiacal constellations, with figures\r\nof Capeya, of Casyape, seated, and holding a lotus-flower in her\r\nhand; of Antarmada, chained, with the fish near her; and of Parasica,\r\nholding the head of a monster, which he had killed, dropping blood,\r\nand having snakes for hair.”\r\n\r\nWho does not recognise in this, Perseus, Cepheus, and Cassiope? But\r\nwe must not forget that this pundit of Mr Wilfort’s has become much\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\n[209] Chou-king, p. 6 and 7.\r\n\r\n[210] Idem, p. 66. _et seq._\r\n\r\n[211] See, in the Connaissance des Temps of 1809, p. 382, and in M.\r\nDelambre’s Histoire de l’Astronomie ancienne, vol. i. p. 391, the\r\nextract of a memoir by P. Gaubil, on the Observations of the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[212] Thus at Dendera, the ancient Tentyris, a city below Thebes,\r\nin the portico of the great temple, the entrance of which faces the\r\nnorth, there are seen on the ceiling the signs of the zodiac marching\r\nin two bands, one of which extends along the eastern side, and the\r\nother along the opposite one. Each of the bands is embraced by the\r\nfigure of a woman of the same length, the feet of which are toward\r\nthe entrance, the head and arms toward the bottom of the portico;\r\nthe feet are consequently to the north, and the heads to the south.\r\n(Great Work on Egypt, Antiq. vol. ix. pl. 20.)\r\n\r\nThe Lion is at the head of the band which is on the western side;\r\nhis direction is toward the north, or toward the feet of the figure\r\nof the woman, and his feet are toward the eastern wall. The Virgin,\r\nthe Balance, the Scorpion, the Saggittary and the Capricorn, follow\r\nmarching in the same line. The latter is placed toward the bottom of\r\nthe portico, and near the hands and head of the large figure of the\r\nwoman. The signs of the eastern band commence at the extremity where\r\nthose of the other band terminate, and are consequently directed\r\ntoward the bottom of the portico, or toward the arms of the large\r\nfigure. They have the feet toward the lateral wall of their own side,\r\nand the heads in the contrary direction to those of the opposite\r\nband. The Aquarius marches first, and is followed by the Fishes,\r\nthe Ram, the Bull, and the Twins. The last of the series, which is\r\nthe Crab, or rather the Scarabæus, (for this insect is substituted\r\nfor the crab in the zodiacs of Egypt), is thrown to a side upon the\r\nlegs of the large figure. In the place which it should have occupied\r\nis a globe resting upon the summit of a pyramid, composed of small\r\ntriangles, which represent a sort of rays, and before the base of\r\nwhich is a large head of a woman with two small horns. A second\r\nscarabæus is placed awry and cross-wise upon the first band, in the\r\nangle which the feet of the large figure form with the body, and\r\nbefore the space in which the Lion marches, which is a little behind.\r\nAt the other end of this same band, the Capricorn is very near the\r\nbottom, or at the arms of the large figure; and, upon the left band,\r\nthe Aquarius is separated to some distance from it. The Capricorn,\r\nhowever, is not repeated like the Crab. The division of this zodiac,\r\nfrom the entrance, is therefore made between the Lion and the Cancer;\r\nor if it be thought that the repetition of the Scarabæus marks a\r\ndivision of the sign, it takes place in the Crab itself; but that of\r\nthe lower end is made between the Capricorn and Aquarius.\r\n\r\nIn one of the inner halls of the same temple, there was a circular\r\nplanisphere inscribed in a square, the same that has been brought to\r\nParis by M. Lelorrain, and which is to be seen at the Royal Library.\r\nIn it, also, the signs of the zodiac are observed among many other\r\nfigures which appear to represent constellations. (Great Work on\r\nEgypt, Antiq. vol. iv. pl. 21.) The Lion corresponds to one of the\r\ndiagonals of the square; the Virgin, which follows, corresponds to\r\na perpendicular line which is directed toward the east; the other\r\nsigns march in the usual order, till we come to the Crab, which, in\r\nplace of completing the chain, by corresponding to the level of the\r\nLion, is placed above it, nearer the centre of the circle, in such a\r\nmanner that the signs are upon a somewhat spiral line. This Crab, or\r\nrather Scarabæus, marches in a contrary direction to the other signs.\r\nThe Twins correspond to the north, the Sagittary to the south, and\r\nthe Fishes to the east, but not very exactly. At the eastern side of\r\nthis planisphere is a large figure of a woman, with the head directed\r\ntoward the south, and the feet toward the north, like that of the\r\nportico. Some doubt might therefore also be raised regarding the\r\npoint at which the series of the signs ought to commence. According\r\nas one of the perpendiculars or one of the diagonals is taken, or the\r\nplace where one part of the series passes over the other part, the\r\ndivision will be judged to be at the Lion, or between the Lion and\r\nthe Crab; or lastly at the Twins.\r\n\r\nAt Esne, the ancient Latopolis, a city placed above Thebes, there\r\nare zodiacs on the ceilings of two different temples. That of the\r\ngreat temple, the entrance of which faces the east, is upon two\r\nbands, which are contiguous and parallel to one another, along the\r\nsouth side of the ceiling. The female figures which embrace them are\r\nnot placed in the direction of their length, but in that of their\r\nbreadth, so that one lies across near the entrance, or to the east,\r\nthe head and arms toward the north, and the feet toward the lateral\r\nwall, or toward the south, and the other is in the bottom of the\r\nportico, equally across, and looking toward the first. The band\r\nnearest the axis of the portico, or the north, presents first, on\r\nthe side of the entrance, or east, and toward the head of the female\r\nfigure, the Lion, placed a little behind, and marching toward the\r\nbottom, the feet directed toward the lateral wall. Behind the Lion,\r\nat the commencement of the band, are two smaller Lions. Before it is\r\nthe Scarabæus, and then the Twins marching in the same direction;\r\nthen the Bull and the Ram, and the Fishes close to each other,\r\nplaced across upon the middle of the band, the Bull having its head\r\ntoward the lateral wall, the ram toward the axis. The Aquarius is\r\nmore distant, and resumes the same direction toward the bottom as\r\nthe first signs. On the band nearest the lateral wall and the north,\r\nwe see first, but at a considerable distance from the wall of the\r\nbottom, or the west, the Capricorn, which marches in a contrary\r\ndirection to the Aquarius, and is directed toward the east, or the\r\nentrance of the portico, having the feet turned toward the lateral\r\nwall. Close upon it is the Sagittarius, which thus corresponds with\r\nthe Fishes and Ram. It also marches toward the entrance; but its feet\r\nare turned toward the axis, and in a contrary direction to those of\r\nthe Capricorn. At a certain distance before, and placed near one\r\nanother, are the Scorpion and a woman holding the Balance. Lastly, a\r\nlittle before, but still at a considerable distance from the anterior\r\nor eastern extremity, is the Virgin which is preceded by a sphinx.\r\nThe Virgin and the woman holding the Balance, have also their feet\r\ntoward the wall, so that the Sagittary is the only one which is\r\nplaced with its head contrary to the other signs.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Esne is a small isolated temple, equally facing the\r\neast, and having a zodiac also in its portico (Great Work on Egypt,\r\nAntiquities, vol. i. Plate 87.) This zodiac is upon two lateral and\r\nseparated bands. That which extends along the south side commences\r\nwith the Lion, which marches toward the bottom, or toward the west,\r\nthe feet turned toward the wall, or the south. It is preceded by\r\nthe Scarabæus, and the latter by the Gemini, marching in the same\r\ndirection. The Bull, on the contrary, faces them, having a direction\r\ntoward the east. But the Ram and the Fishes resume the direction\r\ntoward the bottom, or toward the west. On the band of the north\r\nside, the Aquarius is near the bottom, or the west, marching towards\r\nthe entrance or east, the feet turned toward the wall, preceded by\r\nthe Capricorn and Sagittary, both marching in the same direction.\r\nThe other signs are lost; but it is clear that the Virgin must have\r\nmarched at the head of this band, on the side next the entrance.\r\nAmong the accessory figures of this small zodiac, must be remarked\r\ntwo winged Rams placed across, the one between the Bull and the\r\nTwins, the other between the Scorpion and Sagittary, and each nearly\r\nin the middle of its band; the second, however, a little more\r\nadvanced toward the entrance.\r\n\r\nIt was at first thought, that, in the great zodiac of Esne, the\r\ndivision of the entrance took place between the Virgin and the Lion,\r\nand that of the bottom between the Fishes and the Aquarius. But Mr\r\nHamilton, and MM. de Jollois and Villiers, have supposed, that, in\r\nthe Sphinx, which precedes the Virgin, they found a repetition of the\r\nLion, analogous to that of the Cancer in the great zodiac of Dendera;\r\nso that, according to them, the division would be at the Lion. In\r\nfact, without this explanation, there would only be five signs on one\r\nside, while there would be seven on the other.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the small zodiac of the north of Esne, it is not known\r\nwhether some emblem analogous to this Sphinx may have occurred in it,\r\nbecause this part is destroyed.--See British Review, February 1817,\r\np. 136; and Critical Letter on Zodiacomania, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[213] Description of the Pyramids of Ghiza, by M.

The Bay of Amphila, in the Red Sea,\r\nis formed, he says, of twelve islands, eleven of which are in part\r\ncomposed of alluvial matters, consisting of corallines, madrepores,\r\nechinites, and a great variety of shells common in that sea. The\r\nheight of these islands is sometimes thirty feet above high water.\r\nThe small island, which differs from the eleven others, is composed\r\nof a solid limestone rock, in which veins of calcedony are observed.\r\nDoes not this small island, we may ask, indicate that some cause has\r\nprevented the madrepores from covering it, while they constructed\r\ntheir habitations in the neighbourhood, on bases which probably must\r\nbe of the same nature as those of the small island?\r\n\r\n[383] On glancing over the charts of Kotzebue’s voyage, we are\r\nstruck at seeing several of these islands grouped in a circular\r\nform, connected with one another by reefs which appear to consist of\r\nmadrepores, and to present, by this arrangement, a small internal\r\nsea of great depth, to which an entrance is afforded by one or more\r\nopenings.

They will, we think, be useful to students\r\nof agriculture and geology, and interesting to the general reader.\r\n\r\n[411] The dryness depends chiefly, if not entirely, on the fissures\r\nor divisions in the rocky base of the soil; for, in some parts of\r\nSologne in France, as stated by Mr Arthur Young, and in sundry\r\ndistricts of England, chalk and limestone bottoms are occasionally\r\nobserved to be retentive and wet. Undergrounds, formed of chalk or\r\nlimestone, have frequently a thin covering of vegetable mould, from\r\ntheir being, in some cases, over close and wet, and in others over\r\nopen and dry; the former condition being unfriendly to vegetation and\r\nthe formation of mould, and the latter too readily permitting its\r\ndeparture when formed, or otherwise favouring the decomposition and\r\nwaste of that material.\r\n\r\n[412] The reason here assigned is confirmed by some observations\r\ndelivered by one of the latest and most intelligent of the English\r\nwriters on agriculture. “If,” says Mr Marshall, “the several strata”\r\n(viz. the subsoil and base) “are of so loose a texture, as to permit\r\nthe waters of rains to pass quickly downward, without being in\r\nany sufficient degree arrested by the soil, the land may be said\r\nto be worthless to agriculture.” He adds, “Before we suggest any\r\nimprovement of lands of the latter description, it will be proper\r\nto premise, that many of the light sandy soils of Norfolk, which\r\nwould otherwise be uniformly absorbed to a great depth, have a thin\r\nearthy substance, or ‘Pan,’ which intervenes between the soil and the\r\nsubsoil, and which is of such a texture, as to check the descent of\r\nrain waters, and thereby retain them the longer in the soil, as well\r\nas to prevent the manure it contains from being carried away by their\r\nrapid descent; yet sufficiently pervious to prevent a surcharge of\r\nmoisture from injuring the produce. To this fortunate circumstance\r\nis principally owing the fertility of the lands of East Norfolk:\r\nfor wherever this filter happens to be broken by the plough, or\r\notherwise, the soil becomes unfertile, and continues to be so for a\r\nlength of years.”--(_See Norfolk_, vol. i. page 11.) “This fact aptly\r\nsuggests the expedient of improving, or fresh forming, a filter of\r\nthis kind; seeing how capable it is of producing so many valuable\r\nadvantages; the more especially, as it is probably the Norfolk pan\r\nowes its origin to fortuitous art, rather than to nature.”--(_See\r\nNorfolk_, vol. i. page 12.) “A millstone, or other heavy wheel-shaped\r\nstone, made to run upon its edge, in the bottom of the plough-furrow\r\n(the thickness of its edge being equal to the width of the furrow),\r\nby the help of an axle and wheels, would greatly compress a light,\r\nporous subsoil. The idea of forming a pan artificially, struck me\r\nfirst in Norfolk; and time and experience have strengthened it. If\r\nthe experiment be made on a compressible subsoil, as sandy loam, or\r\nthe soft rubble which sometimes intervenes between an absorbent soil\r\nand an open rock, there can be little doubt of its success. But on\r\nloose open gravel, which is not sufficiently mixed with tenacious\r\nmould to sheath it, and lying on an open base, less utility may be\r\nexpected from it.”\r\n\r\n[413] _Vide_ Dr Adam of Calcutta’s Remarks on the Rocks and Soil\r\nof Constantia at the Cape of Good Hope, in an early number of the\r\nEdinburgh Philosophical Journal.\r\n\r\n[414] The ochre yellow colour of the decayed greenstone around\r\nEdinburgh, and in general in many trap districts in this country, is\r\ncaused by the decomposition of the imbedded iron pyrites.\r\n\r\n[415] The Streams of Obsidian in Iceland, Lipari, Peak of Teneriffe,\r\nAscension, and Mexico, afford striking examples of the fact stated\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[416] Those who feel disposed to examine the connection of Geology\r\nand Agriculture, will find many additional details and views given in\r\nHausmann’s work, of which the above may be considered in some degree\r\nas a condensed view.\r\n\r\n[417] John Hart, Esq. Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in\r\nIreland, some time ago sent to me a copy of a very interesting\r\ntract entitled “A Description of the Skeleton of the Fossil Deer\r\nof Ireland, _Cervus megaceros_; drawn up at the instance of the\r\nCommittee of Natural Philosophy of the Royal Dublin Society.”\r\nThe details in the text are extracted from Mr Hart’s memoir, and\r\nthe engraving of the Elk is copied from Mr Hart’s lithographic\r\ndelineation.\r\n\r\n[418] In a Report which Mr Hart made to the Committee of Natural\r\nPhilosophy of the Royal Dublin Society, and which was printed in\r\ntheir Proceedings of July 8. 1824, he alluded to an instance of a\r\npair of these horns having been used as a field gate near Tipperary.\r\nSince that he has learned that a pair had been in use for a similar\r\npurpose near Newcastle, county of Wicklow, until they were decomposed\r\nby the action of the weather. There is also a specimen in Charlemont\r\nHouse, the town residence of the Earl of Charlemont, which is said to\r\nhave been used for some time as a temporary bridge across a rivulet\r\nin the county of Tyrone.\r\n\r\n[419] I have seen this antler divided into three points in two\r\nspecimens, one at the Earl of Besborough’s, county Kilkenny (which\r\nmeasured eight feet four inches between the tips), the other in the\r\nhall of the Museum of Trinity College: it is single in the greater\r\nnumber of specimens, as in those which Cuvier describes.\r\n\r\n[420] Vide Annales du Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, tome xii. et\r\nOssemens Fossiles, tome iv.\r\n\r\n[421] Philosophical Transactions, vol. xix.\r\n\r\n[422] A fine pair of this species, male and female, were exhibited\r\nby Mr Bullock in this city a few summers ago. They did not answer to\r\nany description of Pennant or of Dr Shaw, but had the characters of\r\nC. canadensis as given by Cuvier.\r\n\r\n[423] Dr Percy, Bishop of Dromore, describes a pair which measured\r\nfourteen feet by the skull.

W. Schlegel’s Contributions to the History of the\r\nElephant, in the Indische Bibliothek, i. 2, are enumerated many facts\r\nnot generally known regarding the African and Asiatic Elephants, and\r\nthe details are accompanied with interesting inferences.\r\n\r\n[431] According to Schleiermacher, Goldfuss and Von Bachr, fossil\r\ntusks, resembling those of the African Elephant, have been found in\r\nsome districts. Cuvier, however, questions their being in a true\r\nfossil state.\r\n\r\n[432] This plate forms the frontispiece to the present work.\r\n\r\n[433] Sœmmering über die fossilien Knocken, welche in der _Protogæa_\r\nVon Leibnitz abgebildet sind: eine Abhandlung in der Magazin für die\r\nNaturgeschichte des Menschen von C.

Cave in _Duncombe Park_, not far from that of Kirkdale. It\r\ncontains only recent bones.\r\n\r\n2. Cave of _Hutton_, a village in Somersetshire, at the foot of\r\nthe Mendip Hills. Bones of elephants, horses, hogs, of two species\r\nof deer, of oxen, the nearly entire skeleton of a fox, and the\r\nmetacarpal bone of a large bear, have been found in it.\r\n\r\n3. Cave of _Derdham Down_, near to _Clifton_, to the westward of\r\nBristol. Bones of horses were found in it.\r\n\r\n4. Cave of _Balleye_, near to _Warksworth_, in Derbyshire. In 1663,\r\nteeth of elephants, some of which are still preserved, were found in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n5. Cave of _Dream_, at the village of _Callow_, near to _Warksworth_.\r\nIt was discovered in the year 1822, by some miners in search of\r\nlead-ore. Nearly all the bones of a rhinoceros, in a good state of\r\npreservation, were found enclosed in a bed of mud in this cave.\r\n\r\n6. Fissures and caves at _Oreston_. These are in transition\r\nlimestone. Bones of the rhinoceros, hyæna, tiger, wolf, deer, ox, and\r\nhorse, have been found in them.\r\n\r\n7. Cave of _Nicholaston_, near the coast of _Glamorgan_, in the Bay\r\nof _Oxwich_. In the year 1792, bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, ox,\r\ndeer, and hyæna, were found in it.\r\n\r\n8. Caves of _Paveland_, in the county of _Glamorgan_, between the Bay\r\nof Oxwich and Cape Worms, at the entrance of the English Channel.\r\nThere are two openings in a cliff thirty or forty feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, which we cannot reach but at low water. The\r\nclergyman and the surgeon of the neighbouring village of Portinan\r\nfound in them a tusk and grinder of an elephant; afterwards other\r\nbones of the elephant, rhinoceros, horse, bear, hyæna, fox, wolf,\r\nox, deer, rat, of birds, the _skeleton of a woman_, and splinters\r\nof bones, were also found. But many of these bones are modern; and\r\nthe diggings made at remote and unknown periods have displaced the\r\nancient bones, and mixed them with the modern, and also with shells\r\nof the present sea.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goldfuss, in the 11th volume of the _Nova Acta\r\nPhysico-medica Academiæ Cæsareæ Leopoldino-Carolinæ Naturæ\r\nCuriosorum_, published in 1823, gives an account of the fossil bones\r\nhe met with in the caves of Westphalia and Franconia. Speaking of the\r\nCave of Gaylenreuth, he says, that Esper has the following remarks on\r\nthe quantity of bones taken from these caves:\r\n\r\nOn first examination, there were collected, in a very short time,\r\nin the dust of the floors of these caves, upwards of 200 different\r\nteeth; and we may assume that, by the end of the year 1774, some\r\nthousands were collected. It is difficult to form a conception of\r\nthe number of these zoolithes, and of the earth in which they are\r\ncontained; and I do not hesitate in believing, that, at the lowest\r\nestimate, several hundred waggons load would not remove the whole.\r\nThe animal earth, with intermingled bones, was, in many places, eight\r\nor ten feet deep. Esper calculated that, in his time, 180 skulls had\r\nbeen taken out of the loose animal earth, the conglomerate not having\r\nbeen broken up for this purpose. Of late years, the conglomerate\r\nafforded, in the space of three years, 150 skulls; and we may\r\nestimate that twice as many more were destroyed in breaking them\r\nout of the hard stalactitic matter. If we add to this the pieces of\r\nskulls which occur in this repository, more frequently than perfect\r\nskulls, we may estimate that more than a thousand individuals lie\r\nburied here.\r\n\r\nThese bones occur now, as formerly, irregularly dispersed; that is,\r\nteeth, cylindrical bones, cranial bones, and vertebræ of different\r\nspecies, and of different individuals of different ages, and of\r\nvarious sizes, occur conglutinated together. We never find the under\r\njaw of the same skull near to it, and rarely the two separated\r\nportions of the same lower jaw together; the skulls occurring all\r\nin the deeper places: and Esper found the teeth forming a bed by\r\nthemselves. The bones still possess their sharper edges, and are\r\nneither rubbed nor gnawed.\r\n\r\nIf we assume a thousand buried individuals, the proportion of the\r\ndifferent species will be, according to Dr Goldfuss, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Hyæna spelæa,        25\r\n  2. Canis spelæus,       50\r\n  3. Felis spelæa,        25\r\n  4. Gulo spelæus,        30\r\n  5. Ursus priscus,       10\r\n  6. Ursus arctoideus,    60\r\n  7. Ursus spelæus,      800\r\n\r\nThe bones of small animals, mentioned by Esper, are now no longer met\r\nwith; and, in the collections of Esper and Frischmann, Dr Goldfuss\r\nsaw only a few dozen of the glutton (Gulo.) The contents of a\r\npeculiar conglomerate described by Esper, cannot now be determined.\r\nIt consisted of a confused assemblage of very small bones, the\r\nfracture surfaces of which were fibrous, and contained also the\r\nthigh-bone and rib of a bird, which were conjectured to equal in size\r\nthose of the eagle; hence Esper inferred that the mass was made up of\r\nthe remains of reptile and fish bones.\r\n\r\nNo remains have hitherto been found in these caves; but in former\r\ntimes we are told that teeth of the elephant were found in the\r\nZahnloch, and a vertebra, supposed, of a rhinoceros, in the\r\nSchneiderloch. The bones of domestic animals, such as deer, roes,\r\nfoxes, and badgers, frequently found in the caves, shew, at a glance,\r\nthat they have come into their present situation accidentally, at a\r\nmodern period.\r\n\r\nThe cave at _Mockas_ formerly contained in its deepest fissures,\r\nteeth and fragments of bones of bears, associated with rolled stones,\r\nand enveloped in earthy marl. The entrance to this cave is situated\r\non the acclivity of a hill. Goldfuss ascended to the entrance of\r\nit by means of a rope, and found in its interior many narrow, wide\r\nextended hollows, which are generally so confined that we can only\r\nvisit them by creeping. Here and there there are small widenings, and\r\nfrequently narrow outlets occur in the roof.\r\n\r\nThe _Zahnloch_ and the _Schneiderloch_, which also contain single\r\nbones of bears, are small vaults, with wide openings, into which we\r\ncan penetrate without difficulty.\r\n\r\n[437] The fact mentioned in the text brings to our recollection an\r\ninteresting Memoir of Professor Walther, entitled, “On the Antiquity\r\nof diseases in Bones,” printed in Grasse and Walther’s Journal der\r\nChirurgie und Augenheil Kunde, viii. From eleven specimens of bones\r\nof cave-bears found in the Caves of Sundwich, described by Walther,\r\na proof is obtained, that the common forms of osseous diseases occur\r\nin them, just as they are observed at present in the human species,\r\nviz. necrosis, anchylosis, caries, exostosis, formation of new bony\r\nmatter, thickening, thinning, and arthritic properties of diseased\r\nbones. Most of those diseases are such as would result from violent\r\ninjuries, and the consequent very tedious organo-vital reaction. Such\r\nmechanical injuries would give rise to necrosis, caries, exostosis,\r\n&c. We can easily conceive, says Walther, how that the rapacious\r\nanimals of a former world may have been exposed to violent mechanical\r\ninjuries of their bodies, and of single parts of them. It is worthy\r\nof remark, that most of the diseased bones are of the lower jaw, the\r\nalveolar processes of it and the walls of single alveolæ. During the\r\ncombats of the cave bears for their prey amongst themselves, or with\r\nother gigantic animals, the jaws and teeth must have experienced the\r\ngreatest mechanical injuries. The necroses of the humeral bones are\r\nsuch as might result from a bruising of the bones, and the caries of\r\nthe upper surface of the bodies of the lumbar vertebræ, may have been\r\noccasioned by external violence. Walther is also of opinion, that\r\nthe cave-bears suffered from diseases of the bones not referrible\r\nto mechanical injuries. He remarks of a radius and a vertebra,\r\nwhose arthritic condition he carefully describes, “These bones have\r\nexperienced pathological changes, which could only arise from a long\r\ncontinued diseased condition of the nutritive process. They are very\r\nlight, have an extremely thin crust, the greater part of their mass\r\nis of a spongy, very porous substance, and are uncommonly fragile.\r\nSuch a change could not be produced by any external mechanical\r\ninjury, nor by any slight action of the weather; but must proceed\r\nfrom a tedious constitutional disease, connected with a total\r\nchange of the organo-forming plastic activity, and proceeding from\r\na peculiar dyscrasia.” Hence it is probable, these cave-bears even\r\nsuffered from gout, scrophula, and other similar diseases.\r\n\r\n[438] According to Laugier, in 100 parts of the earth in which\r\nthe bones in the caves of Gaylenreuth are imbedded, he found the\r\nfollowing proportional quantity of constituent parts:\r\n\r\n  1. Lime, with a little magnesia, in the state of carbonate,     32.0\r\n  2. Carbonic acid and moisture,                                  24.0\r\n  3. Phosphate of lime,                                           21.5\r\n  4. Animal matter and water,                                     10.0\r\n  5. Alumina slightly coloured with manganese,                     4.0\r\n  6. Silica coloured with iron,                                    4.0\r\n  7.

Meuder of\r\n  Freyberg, and being desirous of making this collection as generally\r\n  useful as possible, I mentioned my wish to Mr Syme, who readily\r\n  undertook to make a delineation of all the varieties in this\r\n  collection. This he executed with his usual skill and accuracy;\r\n  adding, at the same time, to the series several other colours,\r\n  which he has distinguished by appropriate names, and arranged along\r\n  with those in the Wernerian system. The whole has been published in\r\n  a series of Tables, in a Treatise which ought to be in the hands of\r\n  every Mineralogist, and indeed in the possession of Naturalists of\r\n  every description.”--Professor JAMESON’S _Characters of Minerals_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  In One Volume large 8vo.

But though drawn up with this object, it is strictly\r\n  and entirely an independent and separate Work. At the conclusion\r\n  of the Volume is given a Select Catalogue of Voyages and Travels,\r\n  which, it is hoped, will be found generally useful, not only in\r\n  directing reading and inquiry, but also in the formation of a\r\n  Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  There are several references to both ‘De Luc’ and ‘Deluc’;
