The Horror in Clay._\r\n\r\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the\r\nhuman mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island\r\nof ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not\r\nmeant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its\r\nown direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing\r\ntogether of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas\r\nof reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either\r\ngo mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace\r\nand safety of a new dark age.\r\n\r\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle\r\nwherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have\r\nhinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if\r\nnot masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there\r\ncame the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when I think\r\nof it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread\r\nglimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of\r\nseparated things--in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of\r\na dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing\r\nout; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in\r\nso hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep\r\nsilent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his\r\nnotes had not sudden death seized him.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death\r\nof my grand-uncle, George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic\r\nlanguages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor\r\nAngell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and\r\nhad frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so\r\nthat his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many.\r\nLocally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of\r\ndeath. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the\r\nNewport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been\r\njostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer\r\ndark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from\r\nthe waterfront to the deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians\r\nwere unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed\r\ndebate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk\r\nascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for\r\nthe end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but\r\nlatterly I am inclined to wonder--and more than wonder.\r\n\r\nAs my granduncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower,\r\nI was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for\r\nthat purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in\r\nBoston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published\r\nby the American Archeological Society, but there was one box which I\r\nfound exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing\r\nto other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not find the key till\r\nit occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor\r\ncarried always in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it,\r\nbut when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more\r\nclosely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay\r\nbas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I\r\nfound? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most\r\nsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor\r\nresponsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.\r\n\r\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about\r\nfive by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs,\r\nhowever, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for,\r\nalthough the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do\r\nnot often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric\r\nwriting. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed\r\ncertainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the\r\npapers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this\r\nparticular species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.\r\n\r\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial\r\nintent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear\r\nidea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol\r\nrepresenting a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\r\nconceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded\r\nsimultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature,\r\nI shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy,\r\ntentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary\r\nwings; but it was the _general outline_ of the whole which made it most\r\nshockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a\r\nCyclopean architectural background.\r\n\r\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of\r\npress cuttings, in Professor Angell's most recent hand; and made no\r\npretense to literary style. What seemed to be the main document was\r\nheaded \"_CTHULHU CULT_\" in characters painstakingly printed to avoid\r\nthe erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was\r\ndivided into two sections, the first of which was headed \"1925--Dream\r\nand Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.,\" and\r\nthe second, \"Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville\r\nSt., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg--Notes on Same, & Prof.\r\nWebb's Acct.\" The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some\r\nof them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of\r\nthem citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W.\r\nScott-Eliott's _Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria_), and the rest comments\r\non long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references\r\nto passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books\r\nas Frazer's _Golden Bough_ and Miss Murray's _Witch-Cult in Western\r\nEurope_. The cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illnesses and\r\noutbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar\r\ntale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of\r\nneurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing\r\nthe singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and\r\nfresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle\r\nhad recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly\r\nknown to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode\r\nIsland School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building\r\nnear that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius\r\nbut great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention\r\nthrough the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of\r\nrelating. He called himself \"psychically hypersensitive\", but the staid\r\nfolk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \"queer\".\r\nNever mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social\r\nvisibility, and was now known only to a small group of esthetes from\r\nother towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its\r\nconservatism, had found him quite hopeless.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the\r\nsculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archeological\r\nknowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He\r\nspoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated\r\nsympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the\r\nconspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but\r\narcheology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough\r\nto make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\r\npoetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which\r\nI have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, \"It is new,\r\nindeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and\r\ndreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\r\ngarden-girdled Babylon.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon\r\na sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had\r\nbeen a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable\r\nfelt in New England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been\r\nkeenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of\r\ngreat Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all\r\ndripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics\r\nhad covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\r\nbelow had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which\r\nonly fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render\r\nby the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_\".\r\n\r\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and\r\ndisturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific\r\nminuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief\r\non which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only\r\nin his nightclothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him.\r\nMy uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness\r\nin recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his\r\nquestions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those\r\nwhich tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies;\r\nand Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence\r\nwhich he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in\r\nsome widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor\r\nAngell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any\r\ncult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands\r\nfor future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the\r\nfirst interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man,\r\nduring which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose\r\nburden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping\r\nstone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously\r\nin enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two\r\nsounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters\r\n\"_Cthulhu_\" and \"_R'lyeh_\".\r\n\r\nOn March 23rd, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and\r\ninquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an\r\nobscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman\r\nStreet. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists\r\nin the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of\r\nunconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family,\r\nand from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling\r\noften at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\r\nbe in charge. The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on\r\nstrange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of\r\nthem. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly\r\ndreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing \"miles high\" which\r\nwalked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object,\r\nbut occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the\r\nprofessor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity\r\nhe had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this\r\nobject, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's\r\nsubsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not\r\ngreatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to\r\nsuggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\r\n\r\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p. m. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly\r\nceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and\r\ncompletely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the\r\nnight of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned\r\nto his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no\r\nfurther assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with\r\nhis recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a\r\nweek of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain\r\nof the scattered notes gave me much material for thought--so much, in\r\nfact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy\r\ncan account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in\r\nquestion were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons\r\ncovering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his\r\nstrange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a\r\nprodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\r\nwhom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports\r\nof their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time\r\npast. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but\r\nhe must, at the very least, have received more responses than any\r\nordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original\r\ncorrespondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and\r\nreally significant digest. Average people in society and business--New\r\nEngland's traditional \"salt of the earth\"--gave an almost completely\r\nnegative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless\r\nnocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March\r\n23rd and April 2nd--the period of young Wilcox's delirium. Scientific\r\nmen were little more affected, though four cases of vague description\r\nsuggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there\r\nis mentioned a dread of something abnormal.\r\n\r\nIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came,\r\nand I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to\r\ncompare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half\r\nsuspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\r\nedited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently\r\nresolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow\r\ncognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been\r\nimposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told\r\na disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion\r\nof them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams\r\nbeing immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor's\r\ndelirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported\r\nscenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described;\r\nand some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless\r\nthing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with\r\nemphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with\r\nleanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on\r\nthe date of young Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later\r\nafter incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of\r\nhell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely\r\nby number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal\r\ninvestigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a\r\nfew. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often\r\nwondered if all the objects of the professor's questioning felt as\r\npuzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\r\nreach them.\r\n\r\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic,\r\nmania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell\r\nmust have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was\r\ntremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\r\nwas a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped\r\nfrom a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter\r\nto the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces\r\na dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California\r\ndescribes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some\r\n\"glorious fulfilment\" which never arrives, whilst items from India\r\nspeak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March.\r\nVoodoo orgies multiply in Haiti, and African outposts report ominous\r\nmutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes\r\nbothersome about this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by\r\nhysterical Levantines on the night of March 22-23. The west of Ireland,\r\ntoo, is full of wild rumor and legendry, and a fantastic painter named\r\nArdois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous _Dream Landscape_ in the Paris spring\r\nsalon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane\r\nasylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity\r\nfrom noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions.\r\nA weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely\r\nenvisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I\r\nwas then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters\r\nmentioned by the professor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _2. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas-relief so\r\nsignificant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his\r\nlong manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the\r\nhellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown\r\nhieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered\r\nonly as \"_Cthulhu_\"; and all this in so stirring and horrible a\r\nconnection that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries\r\nand demands for data.\r\n\r\nThis earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before,\r\nwhen the American Archeological Society held its annual meeting in\r\nSt. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and\r\nattainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was\r\none of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took\r\nadvantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering\r\nand problems for expert solution.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest\r\nfor the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man\r\nwho had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special\r\ninformation unobtainable from any local source. His name was John\r\nRaymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an inspector of police. With\r\nhim he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and\r\napparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss\r\nto determine.\r\n\r\nIt must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest\r\nin archeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted\r\nby purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish,\r\nor whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the\r\nwooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo\r\nmeeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with\r\nit, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a\r\ndark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than\r\neven the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart\r\nfrom the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured\r\nmembers, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety\r\nof the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place\r\nthe frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its\r\nfountain-head.\r\n\r\nInspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his\r\noffering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the\r\nassembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they\r\nlost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure\r\nwhose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted\r\nso potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized school of\r\nsculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even\r\nthousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\r\nunplaceable stone.\r\n\r\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close\r\nand careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of\r\nexquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely\r\nanthropoid outline, but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass\r\nof feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind\r\nand fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed\r\ninstinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat\r\nbloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or\r\npedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings\r\ntouched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center,\r\nwhilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs\r\ngripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward\r\nthe bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so\r\nthat the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge forepaws\r\nwhich clasped the croucher's elevated knees. The aspect of the whole\r\nwas abnormally lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source\r\nwas so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was\r\nunmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art\r\nbelonging to civilization's youth--or indeed to any other time.\r\n\r\nTotally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\r\nsoapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and\r\nstriations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The\r\ncharacters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present,\r\ndespite a representation of half the world's expert learning in this\r\nfield, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic\r\nkinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something\r\nhorribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something\r\nfrightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which\r\nour world and our conceptions have no part.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed\r\ndefeat at the inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering\r\nwho suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and\r\nwriting, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle\r\nhe knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, professor of\r\nanthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note.\r\n\r\nProfessor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour\r\nof Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which\r\nhe failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast\r\nhad encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose\r\nreligion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its\r\ndeliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\r\nother Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders,\r\nsaying that it had come down from horribly ancient eons before ever the\r\nworld was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were\r\ncertain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or\r\n_tornasuk_; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic\r\ncopy from an aged _angekok_ or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in\r\nRoman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance\r\nwas the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they\r\ndanced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the\r\nprofessor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a\r\nhideous picture and some cryptic writing. And as far as he could tell,\r\nit was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\r\nnow lying before the meeting.\r\n\r\nThese data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled\r\nmembers, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at\r\nonce to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an\r\noral ritual among the swamp cult-worshipers his men had arrested, he\r\nbesought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken\r\ndown amongst the diabolist Eskimos. There then followed an exhaustive\r\ncomparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both\r\ndetective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase\r\ncommon to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What,\r\nin substance, both the Eskimo wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests\r\nhad chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this--the\r\nword-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase\r\nas chanted aloud:\r\n\r\n        \"_Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn._\"\r\n\r\nLegrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among\r\nhis mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had\r\ntold them the words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:\r\n\r\n         \"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, in response to a general urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse\r\nrelated as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers;\r\ntelling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound\r\nsignificance. It savored of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and\r\ntheosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination\r\namong such half-castes and pariahs as might be least expected to\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to New Orleans police a frantic\r\nsummons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters\r\nthere, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men,\r\nwere in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen\r\nupon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more\r\nterrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and\r\nchildren had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its\r\nincessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller\r\nventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling\r\nchants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added,\r\nthe people could stand it no more.\r\n\r\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile,\r\nhad set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a\r\nguide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles\r\nsplashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day\r\nnever came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss\r\nbeset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragments of a\r\nrotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression\r\nwhich every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create.\r\nAt length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in\r\nsight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of\r\nbobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible\r\nfar, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals\r\nwhen the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through\r\nthe pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant\r\neven to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused\r\npoint-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy\r\nworship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on\r\nunguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil\r\nrepute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were\r\nlegends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a\r\nhuge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters\r\nwhispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner\r\nearth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been there before\r\nD'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the\r\nwholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and\r\nto see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to\r\nkeep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe\r\nof this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps\r\nthe very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\r\nshocking sounds and incidents.\r\n\r\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by\r\nLegrasse's men as they plowed on through the black morass toward the\r\nred glare and the muffled tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar\r\nto men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible\r\nto hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury\r\nand orgiastic license here whipped themselves to demoniac heights by\r\nhowls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those\r\nnighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now\r\nand then the less organized ululations would cease, and from what\r\nseemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong\r\nchant that hideous phrase or ritual:\r\n\r\n        \"_Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn._\"\r\n\r\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came\r\nsuddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one\r\nfainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony\r\nof the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the\r\nface of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized\r\nwith horror.\r\n\r\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an\r\nacre's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and\r\ntwisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a\r\nSime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn\r\nwere braying, bellowing and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped\r\nbonfire; in the center of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the\r\ncurtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in\r\nheight; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the\r\nnoxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up\r\nat regular intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a center hung,\r\nhead downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who\r\nhad disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers\r\njumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from\r\nleft to right in endless bacchanale between the ring of bodies and the\r\nring of fire.\r\n\r\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes\r\nwhich induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard\r\nantiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot\r\ndeeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph\r\nD. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly\r\nimaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of\r\ngreat wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white\r\nbulk beyond the remotest trees--but I suppose he had been hearing too\r\nmuch native superstition.\r\n\r\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief\r\nduration. Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a\r\nhundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their\r\nfirearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five\r\nminutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild\r\nblows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in\r\nthe end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners,\r\nwhom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows\r\nof policemen. Five of the worshipers lay dead, and two severely\r\nwounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their\r\nfellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully\r\nremoved and carried back by Legrasse.\r\n\r\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness,\r\nthe prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and\r\nmentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes\r\nand mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape\r\nVerde Islands, gave a coloring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult.\r\nBut before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something\r\nfar deeper and older than negro fetishism was involved. Degraded and\r\nignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprizing consistency\r\nto the central idea of their loathsome faith.\r\n\r\nThey worshiped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before\r\nthere were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky.\r\nThose Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but\r\ntheir dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first man,\r\nwho formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the\r\nprisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in\r\ndistant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when\r\nthe great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of\r\nR'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath\r\nhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the\r\nsecret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture\r\ncould not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious\r\nthings of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful\r\nfew. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the\r\nOld Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether\r\nor not the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old\r\nwriting now, but things were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual\r\nwas not the secret--that was never spoken aloud, only whispered. The\r\nchant meant only this: \"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits\r\ndreaming.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and\r\nthe rest were committed to various institutions. All denied a part\r\nin the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done\r\nby Black-winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\r\nmeeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no\r\ncoherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract\r\ncame mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed\r\nto have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the\r\ncult in the mountains of China.\r\n\r\nOld Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the\r\nspeculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent\r\nand transient indeed. There had been eons when other Things ruled on\r\nthe earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the\r\ndeathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean\r\nstones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time\r\nbefore man came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the\r\nstars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of\r\neternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought\r\nTheir images with Them.\r\n\r\nThese Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether\r\nof flesh and blood. They had shape--for did not this star-fashioned\r\nimage prove it?--but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars\r\nwere right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky;\r\nbut when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They\r\nno longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone\r\nhouses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty\r\nCthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might\r\nonce more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside\r\nmust serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them\r\nintact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They\r\ncould only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions\r\nof years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe,\r\nfor Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked\r\nin Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came,\r\nthe Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by molding their\r\ndreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nThen, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small\r\nidols which the Great Ones showed them; idols brought in dim eras\r\nfrom dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right\r\nagain, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb\r\nto revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would\r\nbe easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old\r\nOnes; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals\r\nthrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then\r\nthe liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill\r\nand revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a\r\nholocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate\r\nrites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\r\nforth the prophecy of their return.\r\n\r\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in\r\ndreams, but then something had happened. The great stone city R'lyeh,\r\nwith its monoliths and sepulchers, had sunk beneath the waves; and the\r\ndeep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even\r\nthought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory\r\nnever died, and high priests said that the city would rise again when\r\nthe stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of\r\nearth, moldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumors picked up in caverns\r\nbeneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak\r\nmuch. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or\r\nsubtlety could elicit more in this direction. The _size_ of the Old\r\nOnes, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that\r\nhe thought the center lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where\r\nIrem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not\r\nallied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its\r\nmembers. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\r\nChinamen said that there were double meanings in the _Necronomicon_\r\nof the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they\r\nchose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\r\n\r\n    \"That is not dead which can eternal lie,\r\n    And with strange eons even death may die.\"\r\n\r\nLegrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired\r\nin vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro,\r\napparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly\r\nsecret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon\r\neither cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest\r\nauthorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale\r\nof Professor Webb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse's tale,\r\ncorroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent\r\ncorrespondence of those who attended, although scant mention occurs in\r\nthe formal publication of the society. Caution is the first care of\r\nthose accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse\r\nfor some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter's\r\ndeath it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I\r\nviewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably\r\nakin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.\r\n\r\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not\r\nwonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge\r\nof what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man\r\nwho had _dreamed_ not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the\r\nswamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come _in his\r\ndreams_ upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered\r\nalike by Eskimo diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell's\r\ninstant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was\r\neminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having\r\nheard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series\r\nof dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense.\r\nThe dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of\r\ncourse, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the\r\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the\r\nmost sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript\r\nagain and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with\r\nthe cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see\r\nthe sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly\r\nimposing upon a learned and aged man.\r\n\r\nWilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas\r\nStreet, a hideous Victorian imitation of Seventeenth Century Breton\r\narchitecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely\r\nColonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the\r\nfinest Georgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms,\r\nand at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius\r\nis indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, be heard from\r\nsometime as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallized in clay\r\nand will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasies which\r\nArthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in\r\nverse and in painting.\r\n\r\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my\r\nknock and asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I\r\nwas, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity\r\nin probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for\r\nthe study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought\r\nwith some subtlety to draw him out.\r\n\r\nIn a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he\r\nspoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their\r\nsubconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he showed\r\nme a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency\r\nof its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original\r\nof this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had\r\nformed themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the\r\ngiant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing of\r\nthe hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had let\r\nfall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in\r\nwhich he could possibly have received the weird impressions.\r\n\r\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me\r\nsee with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green\r\nstone--whose _geometry_, he oddly said, was _all wrong_--and hear\r\nwith frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from\r\nunderground: \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_,\" \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_.\"\r\n\r\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead\r\nCthulhu's dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply\r\nmoved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of\r\nthe cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass\r\nof his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its\r\nsheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams,\r\nin the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his\r\nimposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was of\r\na type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I\r\ncould never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius\r\nand his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the\r\nsuccess his talent promises.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times\r\nI had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and\r\nconnections. I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others\r\nof that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even\r\nquestioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro,\r\nunfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so\r\ngraphically at first hand, though it was really no more than a detailed\r\nconfirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I\r\nfelt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and\r\nvery ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist\r\nof note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, _as I wish\r\nit still were_, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity\r\nthe coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by\r\nProfessor Angell.\r\n\r\nOne thing which I began to suspect, and which I now fear I _know_, is\r\nthat my uncle's death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill\r\nstreet leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign\r\nmongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor. I did not forget\r\nthe mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana,\r\nand would not be surprized to learn of secret methods and poison\r\nneedles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and\r\nbeliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in\r\nNorway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper\r\ninquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor's data have come\r\nto sinister ears? I think Professor Angell died because he knew too\r\nmuch, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go as\r\nhe did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _3. The Madness from the Sea._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing\r\nof the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray\r\npiece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have\r\nstumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of\r\nan Australian journal, _Sydney Bulletin_ for April 18, 1925. It had\r\nescaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance\r\nbeen avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.\r\n\r\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called\r\nthe \"Cthulhu Cult,\" and was visiting a learned friend of Paterson,\r\nNew Jersey, the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note.\r\nExamining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage\r\nshelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd\r\npicture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the\r\n_Sydney Bulletin_ I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations\r\nin all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut\r\nof a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had\r\nfound in the swamp.\r\n\r\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item\r\nin detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length.\r\nWhat it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my\r\nflagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n                     MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\r\n\r\n    _Vigilant_ Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.\r\n    One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle\r\n    and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange\r\n    Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Morrison Co.'s freighter _Vigilant_, bound from Valparaiso,\r\n    arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow\r\n    the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht _Alert_ of\r\n    Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21',\r\n    W. Longitude 152° 17', with one living and one dead man aboard.\r\n\r\n    The _Vigilant_ left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2d was\r\n    driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy\r\n    storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted;\r\n    and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain\r\n    one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had\r\n    evidently been dead for more than a week.\r\n\r\n    The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown\r\n    origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities\r\n    at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College\r\n    Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says\r\n    he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of\r\n    common pattern.\r\n\r\n    This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange\r\n    story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian\r\n    of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted\r\n    schooner _Emma_ of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th,\r\n    with a complement of eleven men.\r\n\r\n    The _Emma_, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her\r\n    course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22d, in S.\r\n    Latitude 49° 51´, W. Longitude 128° 34´, encountered the _Alert_,\r\n    manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes.\r\n    Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;\r\n    whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without\r\n    warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass\r\n    cannon forming part of the yacht's equipment.\r\n\r\n    The _Emma's_ men showed fight, says the survivor, and though the\r\n    schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed\r\n    to heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the\r\n    savage crew on the yacht's deck, and being forced to kill them all,\r\n    the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly\r\n    abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.\r\n\r\n    Three of the _Emma's_ men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate\r\n    Green, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate\r\n    Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in\r\n    their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering\r\n    back had existed.\r\n\r\n    The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island,\r\n    although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six\r\n    of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent\r\n    about this part of his story and speaks only of their falling into\r\n    a rock chasm.\r\n\r\n    Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried\r\n    to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd.\r\n\r\n    From that time till his rescue on the 12th, the man remembers\r\n    little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his\r\n    companion, died. Briden's death reveals no apparent cause, and was\r\n    probably due to excitement or exposure.\r\n\r\n    Cable advices from Dunedin report that the _Alert_ was well known\r\n    there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the\r\n    waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose\r\n    frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little\r\n    curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm\r\n    and earth tremors of March 1st.\r\n\r\n    Our Auckland correspondent gives the _Emma_ and her crew an\r\n    excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and\r\n    worthy man.\r\n\r\n    The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter\r\n    beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce\r\n    Johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what\r\na train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of\r\ndata on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests\r\nat sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to\r\norder back the _Emma_ as they sailed about with their hideous idol?\r\nWhat was the unknown island on which six of the _Emma's_ crew had\r\ndied, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the\r\nvice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what was known of the\r\nnoxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvelous of all, what deep and more\r\nthan natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now\r\nundeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully\r\nnoted by my uncle?\r\n\r\nMarch 1st--our February 28th according to the International Date\r\nLine--the earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the _Alert_ and\r\nher noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned,\r\nand on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to\r\ndream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had\r\nmolded in his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23rd the\r\ncrew of the _Emma_ landed on an unknown island and left six men dead;\r\nand on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened\r\nvividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster's malign pursuit,\r\nwhilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly\r\ninto delirium! And what of this storm of April 2nd--the date on which\r\nall dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from\r\nthe bondage of strange fever? What of all this--and of those hints of\r\nold Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign;\r\ntheir faithful cult _and their mastery of dreams_? Was I tottering on\r\nthe brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's power to bear? If so, they\r\nmust be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April\r\nhad put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of\r\nmankind's soul.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my\r\nhost adieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month\r\nI was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of\r\nthe strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea taverns.\r\nWaterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there\r\nwas vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during\r\nwhich faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills.\r\n\r\nIn Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned _with yellow hair\r\nturned white_ after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at\r\nSydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed\r\nwith his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience\r\nhe would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty\r\nofficials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo address.\r\n\r\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and\r\nmembers of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the _Alert_, now sold and\r\nin commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing\r\nfrom its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttlefish\r\nhead, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was\r\npreserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well,\r\nfinding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the\r\nsame utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of\r\nmaterial which I had noted in Legrasse's smaller specimen. Geologists,\r\nthe curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed\r\nthat the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of\r\nwhat old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones: \"They\r\nhad come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.\"\r\n\r\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I\r\nnow resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I\r\nre-embarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day\r\nlanded at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg.\r\n\r\nJohansen's address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold\r\nHaardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries\r\nthat the greater city masqueraded as \"Christiania.\" I made the brief\r\ntrip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat\r\nand ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black\r\nanswered my summons, and I was stung with disappointment when she told\r\nme in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no more.\r\n\r\nHe had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at\r\nsea in 1925 had broken him. He had told her no more than he had told\r\nthe public, but had left a long manuscript--of \"technical matters\" as\r\nhe said--written in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from\r\nthe peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near\r\nthe Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window\r\nhad knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his\r\nfeet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians\r\nfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a\r\nweakened constitution.\r\n\r\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave\r\nme till I, too, am at rest; \"accidentally\" or otherwise. Persuading the\r\nwidow that my connection with her husband's \"technical matters\" was\r\nsufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away\r\nand began to read it on the London boat.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple, rambling thing--a naive sailor's effort at a\r\npost-facto diary--and strove to recall day by day that last awful\r\nvoyage. I can not attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its\r\ncloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to show why\r\nthe sound of the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable\r\nto me that I stopped my ears with cotton.\r\n\r\nJohansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the\r\ncity and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think\r\nof the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space,\r\nand of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream\r\nbeneath the sea, known and favored by a nightmare cult ready and eager\r\nto loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave\r\ntheir monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty.\r\nThe _Emma_, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had\r\nfelt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have\r\nheaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men's dreams.\r\nOnce more under control, the ship was making good progress when held\r\nup by the _Alert_ on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate's regret as\r\nhe wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends\r\non the _Alert_ he speaks with significant horror. There was some\r\npeculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction\r\nseem almost a duty, and Johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the charge\r\nof ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the\r\ncourt of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured\r\nyacht under Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone pillar\r\nsticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9', W. Longitude 126°\r\n43' come upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean\r\nmasonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of\r\nearth's supreme terror--the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh, that\r\nwas built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome\r\nshapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu\r\nand his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last,\r\nafter cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams\r\nof the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a\r\npilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not\r\nsuspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\r\n\r\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned\r\ncitadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the\r\nwaters. When I think of the _extent_ of all that may be brooding down\r\nthere I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were\r\nawed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder demons,\r\nand must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or\r\nof any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone\r\nblocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the\r\nstupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the\r\nqueer image found in the shrine on the _Alert_, is poignantly visible\r\nin every line of the mate's frightened description.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something\r\nvery close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing\r\nany definite structure or building, he dwells only on the broad\r\nimpressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--surfaces too great to\r\nbelong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with\r\nhorrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about _angles_\r\nbecause it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams.\r\nHe had said that the _geometry_ of the dream-place he saw was abnormal,\r\nnon-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart\r\nfrom ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing\r\nat the terrible reality.\r\n\r\nJohansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous\r\nAcropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which\r\ncould have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed\r\ndistorted when viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from\r\nthis sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked\r\nleeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second\r\nglance showed concavity after the first showed convexity.\r\n\r\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before\r\nanything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each\r\nwould have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was\r\nonly half-heartedly that they searched--vainly, as it proved--for some\r\nportable souvenir to bear away.\r\n\r\nIt was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith\r\nand shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked\r\ncuriously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon\r\nbas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all\r\nfelt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and\r\njambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like\r\na trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would\r\nhave said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be\r\nsure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative\r\nposition of everything else seemed fantasmally variable.\r\n\r\nBriden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then\r\nDonovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point\r\nseparately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque\r\nstone molding--that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not\r\nafter all horizontal--and the men wondered how any door in the universe\r\ncould be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel\r\nbegan to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced.\r\n\r\nDonovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and\r\nrejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the\r\nmonstrously carven portal. In this fantasy of prismatic distortion it\r\nmoved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter\r\nand perspective seemed upset.\r\n\r\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That\r\ntenebrousness was indeed a _positive quality_; for it obscured such\r\nparts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually\r\nburst forth like smoke from its eon-long imprisonment, visibly\r\ndarkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky\r\non flapping membranous wings. The odor arising from the newly opened\r\ndepths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought\r\nhe heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and\r\neveryone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight\r\nand gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black\r\ndoorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.\r\n\r\nPoor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of\r\nthe six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure\r\nfright in that accursed instant. The Thing can not be described--there\r\nis no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy,\r\nsuch eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.\r\nA mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth\r\na great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that\r\ntelepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of\r\nthe stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and\r\nwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent\r\nsailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great\r\nCthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\r\n\r\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God\r\nrest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan,\r\nGuerrera and Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging\r\nfrenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat,\r\nand Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which\r\nshouldn't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as\r\nif it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and\r\npulled desperately for the _Alert_ as the mountainous monstrosity\r\nflopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure\r\nof all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments\r\nof feverish rushing up and down between wheels and engines to get\r\nthe _Alert_ under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that\r\nindescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on\r\nthe masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing\r\nfrom the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing\r\nship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu\r\nslid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising\r\nstrokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing\r\nshrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one\r\nnight in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.\r\n\r\nBut Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could\r\nsurely overtake the _Alert_ until steam was fully up, he resolved\r\non a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran\r\nlightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty\r\neddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted\r\nhigher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against\r\nthe pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern\r\nof a demon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came\r\nnearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on\r\nrelentlessly.\r\n\r\nThere was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness\r\nas of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and\r\na sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant\r\nthe ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then\r\nthere was only a venomous seething astern; where--God in heaven!--the\r\nscattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously\r\n_recombining_ in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened\r\nevery second as the _Alert_ gained impetus from its mounting steam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the\r\ncabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the\r\nlaughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first\r\nbold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then\r\ncame the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his\r\nconsciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid\r\ngulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a\r\ncomet's tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and\r\nfrom the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating\r\nchorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged\r\nmocking imps of Tartarus.\r\n\r\nOut of that dream came rescue--the _Vigilant_, the vice-admiralty\r\ncourt, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the\r\nold house by the Egeberg. He could not tell--they would think him mad.\r\nHe would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not\r\nguess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\r\n\r\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box\r\nbeside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall\r\ngo this record of mine--this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced\r\ntogether that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have\r\nlooked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the\r\nskies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison\r\nto me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as\r\npoor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone\r\nwhich has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is\r\nsunken once more, for the _Vigilant_ sailed over the spot after the\r\nApril storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and\r\nslay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been\r\ntrapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world\r\nwould by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end?\r\nWhat has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness\r\nwaits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering\r\ncities of men. A time will come--but I must not and can not think! Let\r\nme pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put\r\ncaution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.",
