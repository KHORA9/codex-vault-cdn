But\r\nthere has been an additional motive in the fact that the theory of\r\nheredity published by me a decade ago has given rise not only to many\r\ninvestigations prompted by it, but also to a whole literature of\r\n'refutations,' and, what is much better, has brought to light a mass of\r\nnew facts which, at first sight at least, seem to contradict my main\r\ntheory. As I remain as convinced that the essential part of my theory\r\nis well grounded as I was when I first sketched it, I naturally wish to\r\nshow how the new facts may be brought into harmony with it.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means only with the theory of heredity by itself that\r\nI am concerned, for that has served, so to speak, as a means to a\r\nhigher end, as a groundwork on which to base an interpretation of\r\nthe transformations of life through the course of the ages. For the\r\nphenomena of heredity, like all the functions of individual life, stand\r\nin the closest association with the whole evolution of life upon our\r\nearth; indeed, they form its roots, the nutritive basis from which\r\nall its innumerable branches and twigs are, in the long run, derived.\r\nThus the phenomena of the individual life, and especially those of\r\nreproduction and inheritance, must be considered in connexion with the\r\nTheory of Descent, that the latter may be illumined by them, and so\r\nbrought nearer our understanding.\r\n\r\nI make this attempt to sum up and present as a harmonious whole the\r\ntheories which for forty years I have been gradually building up on\r\nthe basis of the legacy of the great workers of the past, and on the\r\nresults of my own investigations and those of many fellow workers, not\r\nbecause I regard the picture as complete or incapable of improvement,\r\nbut because I believe its essential features to be correct, and because\r\nan eye-trouble which has hindered my work for many years makes it\r\nuncertain whether I shall have much more time and strength granted\r\nto me for its further elaboration. We are standing in the midst of\r\na flood-tide of investigation, which is ceaselessly heaping up new\r\nfacts bearing upon the problem of evolution. Every theory formulated\r\nat this time must be prepared shortly to find itself face to face with\r\na mass of new facts which may necessitate its more or less complete\r\nreconstruction. How much or how little of it may remain, in face of\r\nthe facts of the future, it is impossible to predict. But this will\r\nbe so for a long time, and it seems to me we must not on that account\r\nrefrain from following out our convictions to the best of our ability\r\nand presenting them sharply and definitely, for it is only well-defined\r\narguments which can be satisfactorily criticized, and can be improved\r\nif they are imperfect, or rejected if they are erroneous. In both these\r\nprocesses progress lies.\r\n\r\nThis book consists of 'Lectures' which were given publicly at the\r\nuniversity here. In my introductory lecture in 1867 I championed the\r\nTheory of Descent, which was then the subject of lively controversy,\r\nbut it was not till seven years later that I gave, by way of\r\nexperiment, a short summer course with a view to aiding in the\r\ndissemination of Darwin's views. Then very gradually my own studies and\r\nresearches and those of others led me to add to the Darwinian edifice,\r\nand to attempt a further elaboration of it, and accordingly these\r\n'Lectures,' which were delivered almost regularly every year from 1880\r\nonwards, were gradually modified in accordance with the state of my\r\nknowledge at the time, so that they have been, I may say, a mirror of\r\nthe course of my own intellectual evolution.\r\n\r\nIn the last two decades of the nineteenth century much that is\r\nnew has been introduced into biological science; Nägeli's idea of\r\n'idioplasm'--the substance which determines form; Roux's _Struggle of\r\nthe Parts_, the recognition of a special hereditary substance, 'the\r\ngerm-plasm,' its analysis into chromosomes, and its continuity from\r\ngeneration to generation; the potential immortality of unicellular\r\norganisms and of the germ-cells in contrast to the natural death\r\nof higher forms and 'bodies'; a deeper interpretation of mitotic\r\nnuclear division, the discovery of the centrosphere--the marvellous\r\ndividing apparatus of the cell--which at once allowed us to penetrate\r\na whole stratum deeper into the unfathomable mine of microscopic\r\nvital structure; then the clearing up of our ideas in regard to\r\nfertilization, and the analysis of this into the two processes combined\r\nin it, reproduction and the mingling of the germ-plasms (Amphimixis);\r\nin connexion with this, the phenomena of maturation, first in the\r\nfemale and then in the male cell, and their significance as a reduction\r\nof the hereditary units:--all this and much more we have gained during\r\nthis period. Finally, there is the refutation of the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple, and the consequent elaboration of the principle of selection\r\nby applying it to the hitherto closed region of the ultimate vital\r\nelements of the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nThe actual form of these lectures has developed as they were\r\ntranscribed. But although the form is thus to some extent new, I have\r\nfollowed in the main the same train of thought as in the lectures\r\nof recent years. The lecture-form has been adhered to in the book,\r\nnot merely because of the greater vividness of presentation which it\r\nimplies, but for many other reasons, of which the greater freedom in\r\nthe choice of material and the limiting of quotation to a minimum\r\nare not the least. That all polemics of a personal kind have thus\r\nbeen excluded will not injure the book, but it is by no means lacking\r\nin discussions of opinion, and will, therefore, I trust, contribute\r\nsomething towards the clearing up of disputed points.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to introduce as much of the researches and writings\r\nof others as possible without making the book heavy; but my aim has\r\nbeen to write a book to be read, not merely one to be referred to.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, finally, for whom the book is intended, I can hardly\r\nanswer otherwise than 'For him whom it interests.' The lectures were\r\ndelivered to an audience consisting for the most part of students of\r\nmedicine and natural science, but including some from other faculties,\r\nand sometimes even some of my colleagues in other departments. In\r\nwriting the book I have presupposed as little special knowledge as\r\npossible, and I venture to hope that any one who _reads_ the book and\r\ndoes not merely skim it, will be able without difficulty to enter into\r\nthe abstruse questions treated of in the later lectures.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great satisfaction to me if this book were to be\r\nthe means of introducing my theoretical views more freely among\r\ninvestigators, and to this end I have elaborated special sections more\r\nfully than in the lectures. Notwithstanding much controversy, I still\r\nregard its fundamental features as correct, especially the assumption\r\nof 'controlling' vital units, the determinants, and their aggregation\r\ninto 'ids'; but the determinant theory also implies germinal selection,\r\nand without it the whole idea of the guiding of the course of\r\ntransformation of the forms of life, through selection which rejects\r\nthe unfit and favours the more fit, is, to my mind, a mere torso, or a\r\ntree without roots.\r\n\r\nI only know of two prominent workers of our day who have given\r\nthorough-going adherence to my views: Emery in Bologna and J. Arthur\r\nThomson in Aberdeen. But I still hope to be able to convince many\r\nothers when the consistency and the far-reachingness of these ideas\r\nare better understood. In many details I may have made mistakes which\r\nthe investigations of the future will correct, but as far as the basis\r\nof my theory is concerned I am confident: _the principle of selection\r\ndoes rule over all the categories of vital units_. It does not, indeed,\r\ncreate primary variations, but it determines the paths of evolution\r\nwhich these are to follow, and thus controls all differentiation, all\r\nascent of organization, and ultimately the whole course of organic\r\nevolution on the earth, for everything about living beings depends upon\r\nadaptation, though not on adaptation in the sense in which Darwin used\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nThe great prominence thus given to the idea of selection has been\r\ncondemned as one-sided and exaggerated, but the physicist is quite as\r\nopen to the same reproach when he thinks of gravity as operative not on\r\nour earth alone, but as dominating the whole cosmos, whether visible\r\nto us or not. If there is gravity at all it must prevail everywhere,\r\nthat is, wherever material masses exist; and in the same way the\r\nco-operation of certain conditions with certain primary vital forces\r\nmust call forth the same process of selection wherever living beings\r\nexist; thus not only are the vital units which we can perceive, such\r\nas individuals and cells, subject to selection, but those units the\r\nexistence of which we can only deduce theoretically, because they are\r\ntoo minute for our microscopes, are subject to it likewise.\r\n\r\nThis extension of the principle of selection to all grades of vital\r\nunits is the characteristic feature of my theories; it is to this idea\r\nthat these lectures lead, and it is this--in my own opinion--which\r\ngives this book its importance. This idea will endure even if\r\neverything else in the book should prove transient.\r\n\r\nMany may wonder, perhaps, why in the earlier lectures much that\r\nhas long been known should be presented afresh, but I regard it as\r\nindispensable that the student who wishes to make up his own mind in\r\nregard to the selection-idea should not only be clear as to what it\r\nmeans theoretically, but should also form for himself a conception\r\nof its sphere of influence. Many prejudiced utterances in regard\r\nto 'Natural Selection' would never have been published if those\r\nresponsible for them had known more of the facts; if they had had\r\nany idea of the inexhaustible wealth of phenomena which can only be\r\ninterpreted in the light of this principle, in as far, that is, as\r\nwe are able to give explanations of life at all. For this reason I\r\nhave gone into the subject of colour-adaptations, and especially into\r\nthat of mimicry, in great detail; I wished to give the reader a firm\r\nfoundation of fact from which he could select what suited him when\r\nhe wished to test by the light of facts the more difficult problems\r\ndiscussed in the book.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to thank all those who have given me assistance\r\nin one way or other in this work: my former assistant and friend\r\nProfessor V. Häcker in Stuttgart, my pupils and fellow workers Dr.\r\nGunther and Dr. Petrunkewitsch, and the publisher, who has met my\r\nwishes in the most amiable manner.\r\n\r\n  FREIBURG-I-BR.,\r\n  _February 20, 1902_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE TO ENGLISH EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR WEISMANN'S _Evolution Theory_, here translated from the\r\nsecond German edition (1904), is a work of compelling interest, the\r\nfruit of a lifetime of observation and reflection, a veteran's judicial\r\nsumming up of his results, and certainly one of the most important\r\ncontributions to Evolution literature since Darwin's day.\r\n\r\nAs the author's preface indicates, the salient features of his crowning\r\nwork are (1) the illumination of the Evolution process with a wealth\r\nof fresh illustrations; (2) the vindication of the 'Germ-plasm'\r\nconcept as a valuable working hypothesis; (3) the final abandonment\r\nof any assumption of transmissible acquired characters; (4) a further\r\nanalysis of the nature and origin of variations; and (5), above all, an\r\nextension of the Selection principle of Darwin and Wallace, which finds\r\nits logical outcome in the suggestive theory of Germinal Selection.\r\n\r\nThe translation will be welcomed, we believe, not only by biological\r\nexperts who have followed the development of 'Weismannism' during the\r\nlast twenty years, and will here find its full expression for the time\r\nbeing, but also by those who, while acquainted with individual essays,\r\nhave not hitherto realized the author's complete system. Apart from\r\nthe theoretical conceptions which unify the book and mark it as an\r\noriginal contribution of great value, there is a lucid exposition of\r\nrecent biological advances which will appeal to those who care more\r\nfor facts than theories. To critics of evolutionism, who are still\r\nhappily with us, the book ought to be indispensable; it will afford\r\nthem much material for argumentation, and should save them many tilts\r\nagainst windmills. But, above all, the book will be valued by workers\r\nin many departments of Biology, who are trying to help in the evolution\r\nof Evolution Theory, for it is characteristic of the author, as the\r\nhistory of recent research shows, to be suggestive and stimulating,\r\nclaiming no finality for his conclusions, but urging us to test them in\r\na mood of 'thätige Skepsis.'\r\n\r\nThe translation of this book--the burden of which has been borne\r\nby my wife--has been a pleasure, but it has also been a serious\r\nresponsibility. We have had fine examples set us by previous\r\ntranslators of some of Weismann's works, Meldola, Poulton, Shipley,\r\nParker, and others; and if we have fallen short of their achievements,\r\nit has not been for lack of endeavour to follow the original with\r\nfidelity, nor for lack of encouragement on the part of the author, who\r\nrevised every page and suggested many emendations.\r\n\r\n  J.

According to this\r\ndoctrine of descent, the whole diversity of animals and plants owes\r\nits origin to a transformation process, in the course of which the\r\nearliest inhabitants of our earth, extremely simple forms of life,\r\nwere in part evolved in the course of time into forms of continually\r\nincreasing complexity of structure and efficiency of function, somewhat\r\nin the same way as we can see every day, when any higher animal is\r\ndeveloped from a single cell, the egg-cell, not suddenly or directly,\r\nbut connected with its origin by a long series of ever more complex\r\ntransformation stages, each of which is the preparation for, and leads\r\non to the succeeding one. The theory of descent is thus a theory of\r\ndevelopment or evolution. It does not merely, as earlier science did,\r\ntake for granted and describe existing forms of life, but regards them\r\nas having become what they are through a process of evolution, and it\r\nseeks to investigate the stages of this process, and to discover the\r\nimpelling forces that lie behind it. Briefly, the theory of descent is\r\nan attempt at a scientific interpretation of the origin and diversity\r\nof the animate world.\r\n\r\nIn these lectures, therefore, we have not merely to show on what\r\ngrounds we make this postulate of an evolution process, and to marshall\r\nthe facts which necessitate it; we must also try to penetrate as far\r\nas possible towards the causes which bring about such transformations.\r\nFor this reason we are forced to go beyond the limits of the theory of\r\ndescent in the narrow sense, and to deal with the general processes of\r\nlife itself, especially with reproduction and the closely associated\r\nproblem of heredity. The transformation of species can only be\r\ninterpreted in one of two ways; either it depends on a peculiar\r\ninternal force, which is usually only latent in the organism, but from\r\ntime to time becomes active, and then, to a certain extent, moulds it\r\ninto new forms; or it depends on the continually operating forces which\r\nmake up life, and on the way in which these are influenced by changing\r\nexternal conditions. Which of these alternatives is correct we can only\r\nundertake to determine when we know the phenomena of life, and as far\r\nas possible their causes, so that it is indispensable to make ourselves\r\nacquainted with these as far as we can.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at one of the lowest forms of life, such as an Amœba or\r\na single-celled Alga, and reflect that, according to the theory of\r\nevolution, the whole realm of creation as we see it now, with Man at\r\nits head, has evolved from similar or perhaps even smaller and simpler\r\norganisms, it seems at first sight a monstrous assumption, and one\r\nwhich quite contradicts our simplest and most certain observations. For\r\nwhat is more certain than that the animals and plants around us remain\r\nthe same, as long as we can observe them, not through the lifetime of\r\nan individual only, but through centuries, and in the case of many\r\nspecies, for several thousand years?\r\n\r\nThis being so, it is intelligible enough that the doctrine of\r\nevolution, on its first emergence at the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nwas received with violent opposition, not on the part of the laity\r\nonly, but by the majority of scientific minds, and instead of being\r\nfollowed up, was at first opposed, then neglected, and finally totally\r\nforgotten, to spring up anew in our own day. But even then a host of\r\nantagonists ranged themselves against the doctrine, and, not content\r\nwith loftily ignoring it, made it the subject of the most violent and\r\nvaried attacks.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of affairs when, in 1858, Darwin's book on _The\r\nOrigin of Species_ appeared, and hoisted the flag of evolution afresh.\r\nThe struggle that ensued may now be regarded as at an end, at least\r\nas far as we are concerned--that is, in the domain of science. The\r\ndoctrine of descent has gained the day, and we can confidently say\r\nthat the Evolution theory has become a permanent possession of science\r\nthat can never again be taken away. It forms the foundation of all our\r\ntheories of the organic world, and all further progress must start from\r\nthis basis.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these lectures, we shall find at every step fresh\r\nevidence of the truth of this assertion, which may at first seem all\r\ntoo bold. It is not by any means to be supposed that the whole question\r\nin regard to the transformation of organisms and the succession of\r\nnew forms of life has been answered in full, or that we have now been\r\nfortunate enough to solve the riddle of life itself. No! whether we\r\never reach that goal or not, we are a long way from it as yet, and\r\neven the much easier problem, how and by what forces the evolution of\r\nthe living world has proceeded from a given beginning, is far from\r\nbeing finally settled; antagonistic views are still in conflict, and\r\nthere is no arbitrator whose authoritative word can decide which is\r\nright. The _How?_ of evolution is still doubtful, but not the _fact_,\r\nand this is the secure foundation on which we stand to-day: The world\r\nof life, as we know it, has been evolved, and did not originate all at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nWere I to try to give, in advance, even an approximate idea of the\r\nconfidence with which we can take our stand on this foundation, I\r\nshould be almost embarrassed by the wealth of facts on which I might\r\ndraw. It is hardly possible nowadays to open a book on the minute or\r\ngeneral structural relations, or on the development of any animal\r\nwhatever, without finding in it evidences in favour of the Evolution\r\ntheory, that is to say, facts which can only be understood on the\r\nassumption of the evolution of the organic world. This, too, without\r\ntaking into account at all the continually increasing number of facts\r\nPalæontology is bringing to light, placing before our eyes the forms\r\nwhich the Evolution theory postulates as the ancestors of the organic\r\nworld of to-day: birds with teeth in their bills, reptile-like forms\r\nclothed with feathers, and numerous other long-extinct forms of life,\r\nwhich, covered up by the mud of earlier waters, and preserved as\r\n'fossils' in the later sedimentary rocks, tell us plainly how the\r\nearlier world of animals and plants was constituted. Later, we shall\r\nsee that the geographical distribution of plant and animal species of\r\nthe present day can only be understood in the light of the Evolution\r\ntheory. But meantime, before we go into details, what may justify my\r\nassumption is the fact that the Evolution theory enables us to predict.\r\n\r\nLet us take only a few examples. The skeleton of the wrist in all\r\nvertebrate animals above Fishes consists of two rows of small bones, on\r\nthe outer of which are placed the five bones of the palm, corresponding\r\nto the five fingers. The outer row is curved, and there is thus a space\r\nbetween the two rows, which, in Amphibians and Reptiles, is filled by\r\na special small bone. This 'os centrale' is absent in many Mammals,\r\nnotably, for instance, in Man, and the space between the two rows is\r\nfilled up by an enlargement of one of the other bones. Now if Mammals\r\nbe descended from the lower vertebrates, as the theory of descent\r\nassumes, we should expect to find the 'os centrale' even in Man in\r\nyoung stages, and, after many unsuccessful attempts, Rosenberg has at\r\nlast been able to demonstrate it at a very early stage of embryonic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis prediction, with another to be explained later, is based upon the\r\nexperience that the development of an individual animal follows, in a\r\ngeneral way, the same course as the racial evolution of the species,\r\nso that structures of the ancestors of a species, even if they are\r\nnot found in the fully developed animal, may occur in one of its\r\nearlier embryonic stages. Further on, we shall come to know this fact\r\nmore intimately as a 'biogenetic law,' and it alone would be almost\r\nenough to justify the theory of evolution. Thus, for instance, the\r\nlowest vertebrates, the Fishes, breathe by means of gills, and these\r\nbreathing organs are supported by four or more gill-arches, between\r\nwhich spaces, the gill-slits, remain open for the passage of water.\r\nAlthough Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals breathe by lungs, and at no time\r\nof their life by gills, yet, in their earliest youth, that is, during\r\ntheir early development in the egg, they possess these gill-arches and\r\ngill-slits, which subsequently disappear, or are transformed into other\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of this 'biogenetic law' it could also be predicted\r\nthat Man, in whom, as is well known, there are twelve pairs of ribs,\r\nwould, in his earliest youth, possess a thirteenth pair, for the lower\r\nMammals have more numerous ribs, and even our nearest relatives, the\r\nanthropoid Apes, the gorilla and chimpanzee, have a thirteenth rib,\r\nthough a very small one, and the siamang has even a fourteenth. This\r\nprediction also has been verified by the examination of young human\r\nembryos, in which a small thirteenth rib is present, though it rapidly\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventies I was engaged in investigating the development\r\nof the curious marking which adorns the long body of many of our\r\ncaterpillars. I studied in particular the caterpillars of our Sphingidæ\r\nor hawk-moths, and found, by a comparison of the various stages of\r\ndevelopment from the emergence of the caterpillar from the egg on to\r\nits full growth, that there is a definite succession of different\r\nkinds of markings following each other, in a whole range of species,\r\nin a similar manner. From the standpoint of the Evolution theory,\r\nI concluded that the markings of the youngest caterpillars, simple\r\nlongitudinal stripes, must have been those of the most remote ancestors\r\nof our present species, while those of the later stages, oblique\r\nstripes, were those of ancestors of a later date.\r\n\r\nIf this were the case, then all the species of caterpillar which\r\nnow exhibit oblique stripes in their full-grown stage must have had\r\nlongitudinal stripes in their youngest stages, and because of this\r\nsuccession of markings in the individual development, I was able to\r\npredict that the then unknown young form of the caterpillar of our\r\nprivet hawk-moth (_Sphinx ligustri_) must have a white line along each\r\nside of the back. Ten years later, the English zoologist, Poulton,\r\nsucceeded in rearing the eggs of _Sphinx ligustri_, and it was then\r\ndemonstrated that the young caterpillar actually possessed the\r\npostulated white lines.\r\n\r\nSuch predictions undoubtedly give the hypothesis on which they are\r\nbased, the Evolution theory, a high degree of certainty, and are almost\r\ncomparable to the prediction of the discovery of the planet Neptune\r\nby Leverrier. As is well known, this, the most distant of all the\r\nplanets, whose period of revolution round the sun is almost 165 of\r\nour years, would probably never have been recognized as a planet, had\r\nnot Adams, an astronomer at the Greenwich Observatory, and afterwards\r\nLeverrier, deduced its presence from slight disturbances in the path of\r\nJupiter's moons, and indicated the spot where an unknown planet must be\r\nlooked for. Immediately all telescopes were directed towards the spot\r\nindicated, and Galle, at the Berlin Observatory, found the sought-for\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nWe might with justice regard as lacking in discernment those who, in\r\nthe face of such experiences, still doubt that the earth revolves round\r\nthe sun, and we might fairly say the same of any one who, in the face\r\nof the known facts, would dispute the truth of the Evolution theory. It\r\nis the only basis on which an understanding of these facts is possible,\r\njust as the Kant-Laplace theory of the solar system is the only basis\r\non which an adequate interpretation of the facts of the heavens can be\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nTo this comparison of the two theories it has been objected that the\r\nEvolution theory has far less validity than the other, first, because\r\nit can never be mathematically demonstrated, and secondly, because\r\nat the best it can only interpret the transformations of the animate\r\nworld, and not its origin. Both objections are just: the phenomena\r\nof life are in their nature much too intricate for mathematics to\r\ndeal with, except with extreme diffidence; and the question of the\r\norigin of life is a problem which will probably have to wait long for\r\nsolution. So, if it gives pleasure to any one to regard the one theory\r\nas having more validity than the other, no one can object; but there\r\nis no particular advantage to be gained by doing so. In any case, the\r\nEvolution theory shares the disadvantage of not being able to explain\r\neverything in its own province with the Kant-Laplace cosmogony, for\r\nthat, too, must presuppose the first beginning, the rotating nebula.\r\n\r\nAlthough I regard the doctrine of descent as proved, and hold it to be\r\none of the greatest acquisitions of human knowledge, I must repeat\r\nthat I do not mean to say that everything is clear in regard to the\r\nevolution of the living world. On the contrary, I believe that we\r\nstill stand merely on the threshold of investigation, and that our\r\ninsight into the mighty process of evolution, which has brought about\r\nthe endless diversity of life upon our earth, is still very incomplete\r\nin relation to what may yet be found out, and that, instead of being\r\nvainglorious, our attitude should be one of modesty. We may well\r\nrejoice over the great step forward which the dominant recognition of\r\nthe Evolution theory implies, but we must confess that the beginnings\r\nof life are as little clear to us as those of the solar system. But\r\nwe can do this at least: we can refer the innumerable and wonderful\r\ninter-relations of the organic cosmos to their causes--common descent\r\nand adaptation--and we can try to discover the ways and means which\r\nhave co-operated to bring the organic world to the state in which we\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the theory of descent is the most progressive step that\r\nhas yet been taken in the development of human knowledge, I am bound\r\nto give my reasons for this opinion. It is justified, it seems to me,\r\neven by this fact alone, that the Evolution idea is not merely a new\r\nlight on the special region of biological science, zoology and botany,\r\nbut is of quite general importance. The conception of an evolution of\r\nthe world of life upon the earth reaches far beyond the bounds of any\r\nsingle science, and influences our whole realm of thought. It means\r\nnothing less than the elimination of the miraculous from our knowledge\r\nof nature, and the placing of the phenomena of life on the same plane\r\nas the other natural processes, that is, as having been brought about\r\nby the same forces, and being subject to the same laws. In the domain\r\nof the inorganic, no one now doubts that out of nothing nothing can\r\ncome: energy and matter are from everlasting to everlasting, they can\r\nneither be increased or decreased, they can only be transformed--heat\r\ninto mechanical energy, into light, into electricity, and so on. For\r\nus moderns, the lightning is no longer hurled by the Thunderer Zeus\r\non the head of the wicked, but, careless alike of merit or guilt, it\r\nstrikes where the electric tension finds the easiest and shortest line\r\nof discharge. Thus to our mode of thought it now seems clear that no\r\nevent in the world of the living depends upon caprice, that at no\r\ntime have organisms been called forth out of nothing by the mighty\r\nword of a Creator, but they have been produced at all times by the\r\nco-operation of the existing forces of nature, and every species must\r\nhave arisen just where, and when, and in the form in which it actually\r\ndid arise, as the necessary outcome of the existing conditions of\r\nenergy and matter, and of their interactions upon each other. It is\r\nthis correlation of animate nature with natural forces and natural laws\r\nwhich gives to the doctrine of evolution its most general importance.\r\nFor it thus supplies the keystone in the arch of our interpretation\r\nof nature and gives it unity; for the first time it makes it possible\r\nto form a conception of a world-mechanism, in which each stage is the\r\nresult of the one before it, and the cause of the succeeding one.\r\n\r\nHow deeply all our earlier opinions are affected by this doctrine will\r\nbecome clear if we fix our attention on a single point, the derivation\r\nof the human understanding from that of animal ancestors. What of the\r\nreason of Man, of his morals, of his freedom of will? may be asked,\r\nas it has been, and still is often asked. What has been regarded as\r\nabsolutely distinct from the nature of animals is said to differ from\r\ntheir mental activities only in degree, and to have evolved from them.\r\nThe mind of a Kant, of a Laplace, of a Darwin--or to ascend into\r\nthe plane of the highest and finest emotional life, the genius of a\r\nRaphael or a Mozart--to have any real connexion, however far back,\r\nwith the lowly psychical life of an animal! That is contrary to all\r\nour traditionary, we might say our inborn, ideas, and it is not to be\r\nwondered at that the laity, and especially the more cultured among\r\nthem, should have opposed such a doctrine whose dominating power was\r\nunintelligible to them, because they were ignorant of the facts on\r\nwhich it rests. That a man should feel his dignity lowered by the\r\nidea of descent from animals is almost comical to the naturalist,\r\nfor he knows that every one of us, in his first beginning, occupied\r\na much lowlier position than that of our mammalian ancestors--was,\r\nin fact, as regards visible structure, on a level with the Amœba,\r\nthat microscopically minute unicellular animal, which can hardly be\r\nsaid to possess organs, and whose psychical activities are limited to\r\nrecognizing and engulfing its food. Very gradually at first, and step\r\nby step, there develop from this single cell, the ovum, more and more\r\nnumerous cells; this mass of cells segregates into different groups,\r\nwhich differentiate further and further, until at last they form the\r\nperfect man. This occurs in the development of every human being, and\r\nwe are merely unaccustomed to the thought that it means nothing else\r\nthan an incredibly rapid ascent of the organism from a very low level\r\nof life to the highest.\r\n\r\nStill less is it to be wondered at that the Evolution doctrine met with\r\nviolent opposition on the part of the representatives of religion,\r\nfor it stood in open contradiction to that remarkable and venerable\r\ncosmogony, the Mosaic story of Creation, which people had been\r\naccustomed to regard, not as what it is--a conception of nature at an\r\nearly stage of human culture--but as an inalienable part of our own\r\nreligion. But investigation shows us that the doctrine of evolution is\r\ntrue, and it is only a weak religion which is incapable of adapting\r\nitself to the truth, retaining what is essential, and letting go what\r\nis unessential and subject to change with the development of the\r\nhuman mind. Even the heliocentric hypothesis was in its day declared\r\nfalse by the Church, and Galilei was forced to retract; but the earth\r\ncontinued to revolve round the sun, and nowadays any one who doubted\r\nit would be considered mentally weak or warped. So in all likelihood\r\nthe time is not far distant when the champions of religion will abandon\r\ntheir profitless struggle against the new truth, and will see that the\r\nrecognition of a law-governed evolution of the organic world is no more\r\nprejudicial to true religion than is the revolution of the earth round\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving given this very general orientation of the Evolution problem,\r\nwhich is to engage our attention in detail, I shall approach the\r\nproblem itself by the historical method, for I do not wish to bring\r\nthe views of present-day science quite suddenly and directly into\r\nprominence. I would rather seek first to illustrate how earlier\r\ngenerations have tried to solve the question of the origin of the\r\nliving world. We shall see that few attempts at solution were made\r\nuntil quite recently, that is, until the end of the eighteenth and the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. Only then there appeared a few\r\ngifted naturalists with evolutionist ideas, but these ideas did not\r\npenetrate far; and it was not till after the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that they found a new champion, who was to make them common\r\nproperty and a permanent possession of science. It was the teaching of\r\nCharles Darwin that brought about this thorough awakening, and laid\r\nthe foundations of our present interpretations, and his work will\r\ntherefore engross our attention for a number of lectures. Only after\r\nwe have made ourselves acquainted with his teaching shall we try to\r\ntest its foundations, and to see how far this splendid structure stands\r\non a secure basis of fact, and how deeply its power of interpretation\r\npenetrates towards the roots of phenomena. We shall examine the forces\r\nby which organisms are dominated, and the phenomena produced, and\r\nthereby test Darwin's principles of interpretation, in part rejecting\r\nthem, in part accepting them, though in a much extended form, and thus\r\ntry to give the whole theoretic structure a more secure foundation.\r\nI hope to be able to show that we have made some real progress since\r\nDarwin's day, that deductions have been drawn from his theory which\r\neven he did not dream of, which have thrown fresh light on a vast range\r\nof phenomena, and, finally, that through the more extended use of his\r\nown principles, the Evolution theory has gained a completeness, and an\r\nintrinsic harmony which it previously lacked.\r\n\r\nThis at least is my own opinion, but I cannot ignore the fact that it\r\nis by no means shared by all living naturalists. The obvious gaps and\r\ninsufficiencies of the Darwinian theory have in the last few decennia\r\nprompted all sorts of attempts at improving it. Some of these were lost\r\nsight of almost as soon as they were suggested, but others have held\r\ntheir own, and can still claim numerous supporters. It would only tend\r\nto bewilder if I gave an account of those of the former class, but\r\nthose which still hold their own must be noticed in these lectures,\r\nthough it is by no means my intention to expound the confused mass of\r\nopinions which has gathered round the doctrine of evolution, but rather\r\nto give a presentation of the theory as it has gradually grown up in my\r\nown mind in the course of the last four decades. Even this will not be\r\nthe last of which science will take knowledge, but it will, I hope, at\r\nleast be one which can be further built upon.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, begin at once with that earliest forerunner of the modern\r\ntheory of descent, the gifted Greek philosopher Empedocles, who,\r\nequally important as a leader of the state of Agrigentum, and as a\r\nthinker in purely theoretical regions of thought, advanced very notable\r\nviews regarding the origin of organisms. We must, however, be prepared\r\nto hear something that is hardly a theory in the modern scientific\r\nacceptation of that term; and we must not be repelled by the unbridled\r\npoetical fancy of the speculative philosopher; we have to recognize\r\nthat there is a sound kernel contained in his amusing pictures--a\r\nthought which we meet with later, in much more concrete form, in the\r\nDarwinian theory, and which, if I mistake not, we shall keep firm hold\r\nof in all time to come.\r\n\r\nAccording to Empedocles the world was formed by the four elements of\r\nthe ancients, Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, moved and guided by two\r\nfundamental forces, Hate and Love, or, as we should now say, Repulsion\r\nand Attraction. Through the chance play of these two forces with the\r\nelements, there arose first the plants, then the animals, in such a\r\nmanner that at first only parts and organs of animals were formed:\r\nsingle eyes without faces, arms without bodies, and so on. Then, in\r\nwild play, Nature attempted to put together these separate parts, and\r\nso created all manner of combinations, for the most part inept monsters\r\nunfit for life, but in a few cases, where the parts fitted, there\r\nresulted a creature capable not only of life, but, if the juxtaposition\r\nwas perfect, even of reproduction.\r\n\r\nThis phantastic picture of creation seems to us mad enough, but there\r\nslumbers in it, all unsuspected though it may have been by the author,\r\nthe true idea of selection, the idea that much that is unfit certainly\r\narises, but that only the fit endures. The mechanical coming-to-be of\r\nthe fit is the sound kernel in this wondersome doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe natural science of the ancients, in regard to life and its forms,\r\nreached its climax in Aristotle (died 322 B. C.). A true polyhistorian,\r\nhis writings comprehended all the knowledge of his time, but he also\r\nadded much to it from his own observation. In his writings we find many\r\ngood observations on the structure and habits of a number of organisms,\r\nand he also had the merit of being the first to attempt a systematic\r\ngrouping of animals. With true insight, he grouped all the vertebrates\r\ntogether as Enaimata or animals with blood, and classed all the rest\r\ntogether as Anaimata or bloodless animals. That he denied to the latter\r\ngroup the possession of blood is not to be wondered at, when we take\r\ninto account the extremely imperfect means of investigation available\r\nin his time, nor is it surprising that he should have ranked this\r\nmotley company, in antithesis to the blood-possessing animals, as a\r\nunified and equivalent group. Two thousand years later, Lamarck did\r\nexactly the same thing, when he divided the animals into backboned and\r\nbackboneless, and we reckon this nowadays as a merit only in so far\r\nthat he was the first, after Aristotle, to re-express the solidarity of\r\nthe classes of animals which we now call vertebrates.\r\n\r\nAristotle was, however, not a systematic zoologist in our sense of the\r\nterm, as indeed was hardly possible, considering the very small number\r\nof animal forms that were known in his time. In our day we have before\r\nus descriptions of nearly 300,000 named species wherefrom to construct\r\nour classification, while Aristotle knew hardly more than 200. Of the\r\nwhole world of microscopic animals he could, of course, have no idea,\r\nany more than of the remains of prehistoric animals, of which we now\r\nknow about 40,000 named and adequately described species. One would\r\nhave thought that it would have occurred to a quick-witted people like\r\nthe Greeks to pause and ponder when they found mussel-shells and marine\r\nsnail-shells on the hills far above the sea; but they explained these\r\nby the great flood in the time of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and they did\r\nnot observe that the fossil molluscs were of different species from the\r\nsimilar animals living in the sea in their own day.\r\n\r\nThus there was nothing to suggest to Aristotle and others of his time\r\nthe idea that a transformation of species had been going on through the\r\nages, and even the centuries after him evoked no such idea, nor did\r\nthere arise new speculations, after the manner of Empedocles, in regard\r\nto the origin of the organic world. On the whole, the knowledge of the\r\nliving world retrograded rather than advanced until the beginning of\r\nthe Roman Empire. What Aristotle had known was forgotten, and Pliny's\r\nwork on animals is a catalogue embellished with numerous fables,\r\narranged according to a purely external principle of division. Pliny\r\ndivided animals into those belonging to earth, water, and air, which is\r\nnot very much more scientific than if he had arranged them according to\r\nthe letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the Roman Empire, as is well known, the knowledge of\r\nnatural history sank lower and lower; there was no more investigation\r\nof nature, and even the physicians lost all scientific basis, and\r\npractised only in accordance with their traditional esoteric secrets.\r\nAs the whole culture of the West gradually disappeared, the knowledge\r\nof nature possessed by earlier centuries was also completely lost,\r\nand in the first half of the Middle Ages Europeans revealed a depth\r\nof ignorance of the natural objects lying about them, which it is\r\ndifficult for us now to form any conception of.\r\n\r\nChristianity was in part responsible for this, because it regarded\r\nnatural science as a product of heathendom, and therefore felt bound\r\nto look coldly on it, if not even to oppose it. Later, however, even\r\nthe Christian Church felt itself forced to give the people some mental\r\nnourishment in the form of natural history, and under its influence,\r\nperhaps actually composed by teachers of the Church, there appeared a\r\nlittle book, the so-called _Physiologus_, which was meant to instruct\r\nthe people in regard to the animal world. This remarkable work, which\r\nhas been preserved, must have had a very wide distribution in the\r\nearlier Middle Ages, for it was translated into no fewer than twelve\r\nlanguages, Greek, Armenian, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, and so on. The\r\ncontents are very remarkable, and come from the most diverse sources,\r\nthat is, from the most different writers of antiquity, from Herodotus,\r\nfrom the Bible, and so forth, but never from original observation. The\r\ncompilation does not really give descriptions of animals or of their\r\nhabits, but, of each of the forty-one animals which the _Physiologus_\r\nrecognizes, something remarkable is briefly related in true lapidary\r\nstyle, sometimes a mere curiosity without further import, or sometimes\r\na symbolical interpretation. Thus the book says of the panther: 'he\r\nis gaily coloured; after satiating himself he sleeps three days, and\r\nawakes roaring, giving forth such an agreeable odour that all animals\r\ncome to him.' Of the pelican the well-known legend is related, that\r\nit tears open its own breast to feed its young with its blood, thus\r\nstanding as a symbol of mother-love. Fabulous creatures, too, appear\r\nin these pages. Of the Phœnix, that bird whose plumage glitters with\r\ngold and precious stones, which was known even to Herodotus, and which\r\nhas survived through Eastern fairy-tales on to the time of our own\r\nromanticists (Tieck), we read: 'it lives a thousand years, because it\r\nhas not eaten of the tree of knowledge'; then 'it sets fire to itself\r\nand arises anew from its own ashes,' a symbol of nature's infinite\r\npower of renewing its youth.\r\n\r\nBut while among the peoples of Europe all the science of the ancients\r\nwas lost, except a few barely recognizable fragments, the old lore was\r\npreserved, both as regards organic nature and other orders of facts,\r\namong the Arabs, through whom so many treasures of antiquity have\r\neventually been handed down to us, coming in the track of the Arabian\r\nconquests across North Africa and Spain to the nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way, too, that the writings of Aristotle again found\r\nrecognition, after having been translated into Latin at Palermo at\r\nthe order of that enthusiast for Science and Art, the Hohenstaufen\r\nEmperor, Frederick the Second. Our Emperor presented one copy of\r\nAristotle's writings to the University of Bologna, and thus the\r\nwisdom of the ancient Greeks again became the common property of\r\nEuropean culture. From the thirteenth century to the eighteenth, the\r\nstudy of natural science was limited to repeating and extending the\r\nwork of Aristotle. Nothing new, depending upon personal observation,\r\nwas added, and it does not even seem to have occurred to any one to\r\nsubject the statements of the Stagirite to any test, even when they\r\nconcerned the most familiar objects. No one noticed the error which\r\nascribed to the fly eight legs instead of six; there was in fact as\r\nyet no investigation, and all knowledge of natural history was purely\r\nscholastic, and gave absolute credence to the authority of the ancients.\r\n\r\nA revulsion, however, occurred in the century of the Reformation, with\r\nthe breaking down of the blind belief in authority which had till\r\nthen prevailed in all provinces of human knowledge and thought. After\r\na long and severe struggle, dry scholasticism was finally overcome,\r\nand natural science, with the rest, turned from a mere reliance on\r\nbooks to original thinking and personal observation. Thenceforward\r\ninterpretations of natural processes were sought for no longer in the\r\nwritings of the ancients, but in Nature herself. Of the magnitude\r\nof this emancipation, and of the severity of the struggle against\r\ndeep-rooted authority, one could form a faint idea from experience\r\neven in my own youth. Our young minds were so deeply imbued with the\r\ninvoluntary feeling that the ancients were superior to us moderns\r\nin each and every respect, that not only the hardly re-attainable\r\nplastic art of the Greeks and the immortal songs of Homer, but all the\r\nmental products of antiquity seemed to us models which could never be\r\nequalled; the tragedies of Sophocles were for us the greatest tragedies\r\nthat the world had ever seen, the odes of Horace the most beautiful\r\npoems of all time!\r\n\r\nIn the domain of natural science the new era began with the overthrow\r\nof the Ptolemaic cosmogony, which, for more than a thousand years,\r\nhad served as a basis for astronomy. When the German canon, Nicolas\r\nCopernicus (born at Thorn, 1473, died 1543), reversed the old\r\ntheory, and showed that the sun did not revolve round the earth, but\r\nthe earth round the sun, the ice was broken and the way paved for\r\nfurther progress. Galilei uttered his famous 'e pur si muove,' Kepler\r\nestablished his three laws of the movements of the planets, and Newton,\r\na century later, interpreted their courses in terms of the law of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nBut we have not here to do with a history of physics or astronomy, and\r\nI only wish to recall these well-known facts, in order that we may\r\nsee how increased knowledge in this domain was always accompanied by\r\nadvances in that of biology.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we cannot yet chronicle any such thoroughgoing\r\nrevolution of general conceptions; the basis of detailed empirical\r\nknowledge was not nearly broad enough for that, and it was in the\r\nacquiring of such a foundation that the next three centuries, from the\r\nsixteenth to the end of the eighteenth, were eagerly occupied.\r\n\r\nThe first step necessary was to collate the items of individual\r\nknowledge in regard to the various forms of life, and to bring the\r\nwhole in unified form into general notice. This need was met for the\r\nfirst time by Conrad Gessner's _Thierbuch_, a handsome folio volume,\r\nprinted at Zurich in 1551, and embellished with numerous woodcuts,\r\nsome of them very good. This was followed, in 1600, by a great work in\r\nmany volumes, written in Latin, by a professor of Bologna, Aldrovandi.\r\nNot native animals alone but foreign ones also were described in these\r\nworks, for, after the discovery of America and the opening up of\r\ncommunication with the East Indies, many new animal and plant forms\r\ncame to the knowledge of European nations by way of the sea. Thus\r\nFrancesco Hernandez (died 1600), physician in ordinary to Philip II,\r\ndescribed no fewer than forty new Mammals, more than two hundred\r\nBirds, and many other American animals.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a quite different way, the naturalist's field of vision\r\nwas widened, namely, by the invention of the simple microscope, with\r\nwhich Leeuwenhoek first discovered the new world of Infusorians,\r\nand Swammerdam made his notable observations on the structure and\r\ndevelopment of the very varied minute animal inhabitants of fresh\r\nwater. In the same century, the seventeenth, anatomists like Tulpius,\r\nMalpighi, and many others extended the knowledge of the internal\r\nstructure of the higher animals and of Man, and a foundation was\r\nlaid for a deeper insight into the nature of vital functions by the\r\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood in Man and the higher\r\nanimals. In the following century, the eighteenth, this path of active\r\nresearch was eagerly followed, and we need only mention such names as\r\nRéaumur, Rösel von Rosenhof, De Geer, Bonnet, J. Chr. Schäfer, and\r\nLedermüller, to be immediately reminded of the wealth of facts about\r\nthe structure, life, and especially the development of our indigenous\r\nanimals, which we owe to the labours of these men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these advances, great and many-sided as they were, did not at once\r\nlead to a renewal of the attempt of Empedocles to explain the origin\r\nof the organic world. This was as yet not even recognized as a problem\r\nrequiring investigation, for men were content to take the world of\r\nlife simply as a fact. The idea of getting beyond the naïve, poetic\r\nstandpoint of the Mosaic story of Creation was as yet remote from the\r\nminds of naturalists, partly because they were wholly fascinated by\r\nthe observation of masses of details, but chiefly because, first by\r\nthe English physician, John Ray (died 1678), then by the great Swede,\r\nCarl Linné, the conception of organic 'species' had been formulated and\r\nsharply defined. It is true enough that before the works of these two\r\nmen 'species' had been spoken of, but without being connected with any\r\ndefinite idea; the word was used rather in the same vague sense as the\r\nword 'genus,' to designate one of the smaller groups of organic forms,\r\nbut without implying any clear idea of its scope or of its limitations.\r\nNow, however, for the first time, the term 'species' came to be used\r\nstrictly to mean the smallest homogeneous group of individual forms\r\nof life upon the earth. John Ray held that the surest indication of a\r\n'species' was that its members had been produced from the same seed;\r\nthat is, 'forms which are of different species maintain this specific\r\nnature constantly, and one species does not arise from the seed of\r\nanother.' Here we have the germ of the doctrine of the absolute nature\r\nand the immutability of species which Linné briefly characterized in\r\nthese words: 'Species tot sunt, quot formæ ab initio creatæ sunt,'\r\n'there are just so many species as there were forms created in the\r\nbeginning.' It is here clearly implied, that species as we know them\r\nhave been as they are from all time, that, therefore, they exist in\r\nnature as such and unchangeably, and have not been merely read into\r\nnature by man.\r\n\r\nThis view, though we cannot now regard it as correct, was undoubtedly\r\nreasonable, and thoroughly in accordance with the spirit of the time;\r\nit was congruent with the knowledge, and above all with the scientific\r\nendeavours of the age. In the eighteenth century there was danger that\r\nall outlook on nature as a whole would be lost--smothered under the\r\nenormous mass of isolated facts, and especially under the inundation of\r\ndiverse animal and plant forms which were continually being recognized.\r\nIt must therefore have been regarded as a real deliverance, when Linné\r\nreduced this chaos of forms to a clearly ordered system, and relegated\r\neach form to its proper place and value in relation to the whole. How,\r\nindeed, could the great systematist have performed his task at all, if\r\nhe had not been able to work with definite and sharply circumscribed\r\ngroups of forms, if he had not been able to regard at least the lowest\r\nelements of his system, the species, as fixed and definite types?\r\nOn the other hand, Linné was much too shrewd an observer not to\r\nentertain, in the course of his long life, and under the influence of\r\nthe continually accumulating material, doubts as to the correctness\r\nof his assumption of the fixity and absoluteness of his species. He\r\ndiscovered from his own experience, what is fully borne out by ours,\r\nthat it is easy enough to define a species when there are only a few\r\nspecimens of a form to deal with, but that the difficulty increases\r\nin proportion to the number and to the diversity of habitat of those\r\nthat are to be brought under one category. In the last edition of\r\nthe _Systema Naturæ_ we find very noteworthy passages in which Linné\r\nwonders whether, after all, a species may not change, and in the course\r\nof time diverge into varieties, and so forth. Of these doubts no notice\r\nwas taken at the time; the accepted doctrine of the fixity of species\r\nwas held to and even raised to the rank of a scientific dogma. Georges\r\nCuvier, the great disciple of the Stuttgart 'Karlschule,' accentuated\r\nthe doctrine still further by his establishment of animal-types, the\r\nlargest groups of forms in the animal kingdom within which a definite\r\nand fundamentally distinct plan of architecture prevails. His four\r\ntypes, Vertebrates, Molluscs, Articulate and Radiate animals, furnished\r\na further corroboration of the absolute nature of species, since they\r\nseemed to show that even the highest and most comprehensive groups are\r\nsharply defined off from one another.\r\n\r\nLet me add that this doctrine of the absolute nature of species was not\r\nfully elaborated till our own day, when the Swiss (afterwards American)\r\nnaturalist, Louis Agassiz, went so far as to maintain that not only\r\nthe highest and the lowest categories, but all those coming between\r\nthem, were categories established and sharply separated by Nature\r\nherself. But in spite of much ingenuity and his wide and comprehensive\r\noutlook he exerted himself in vain to find satisfactory and really\r\ncharacteristic definitions of what was to be considered a class, an\r\norder, a family, or a genus. He did not succeed in finding a rational\r\ndefinition of these systematic concepts, and his endeavour may be\r\nregarded as the last important attempt to prop up an interpretation of\r\nnature already doomed to fall. But in referring to Louis Agassiz I have\r\nanticipated the historical course of scientific development, and must\r\ntherefore go back to the last quarter of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first unmistakable pioneer of the theory of descent, which now\r\nemerged for the first time as a scientific doctrine, was our great\r\npoet Goethe. He has indeed been often named as the founder of the\r\ntheory, but that seems to me saying too much. It is true, however, that\r\nthe inquiring mind of the poet certainly recognized in the structure\r\nof 'related' animals the marvellous general resemblances amid all\r\nthe differences in detail, and he probed for the reason of these\r\nform-relations. Through the science of 'comparative anatomy,' as it\r\nwas taught at the close of the century by Kielmeyer, Cuvier's teacher,\r\nand later by Cuvier himself, Blumenbach, and others, numerous facts\r\nhad become known, which paved the way for such questions. It had, for\r\ninstance, been recognized that the arm of man, the wing of the bird,\r\nthe paddle of the seal, and even the foreleg of the horse, contain\r\nessentially the same chain of bones, and Goethe had already expressed\r\nthese relations in his well-known verse,\r\n\r\n  'Alle Gestalten sind ähnlich, doch keine gleichet der andern,\r\n  Und so deutet der Chor auf ein geheimes Gesetz.'\r\n\r\nAs to what this law was he did not at that time pronounce an opinion,\r\nthough he may even then have thought of the transformation of species.\r\nAt first he contented himself with seeking for an ideal archetype or\r\n'Urtypus' which was supposed to lie at the foundation of a larger or\r\nsmaller group. He discovered the archetypal plant or 'Urpflanze,'\r\nwhen he rightly recognized that the parts of the flower are nothing\r\nmore than modified leaves. He spoke plainly of the 'metamorphosis of\r\nplants,' meaning by that the transformation of his 'archetype' into\r\nthe endless diversity of actual plant forms. But at first he certainly\r\nthought of this transformation only in the ideal sense, and not as a\r\nfactual evolutionary process.\r\n\r\nThe first who definitely maintained the latter view was, remarkably\r\nenough, the grandfather of the man who, in our own day, made the theory\r\nof descent finally triumphant, the English physician Erasmus Darwin,\r\nborn 1731. This quiet thinker published, in 1794, a book entitled\r\n_Zoonomia_, and in it he takes the important step of substituting for\r\nGoethe's 'secret law' a real relationship of species. He proclaims the\r\ngradual establishment and ennobling of the animal world, and bases\r\nhis view mainly on the numerous obvious adaptations of the structure\r\nof an organ to its use. I have not been able to find any passage in\r\nthe book in which he has expressly indicated that, because many of\r\nthe conditions of life could not have existed from the beginning,\r\nthese adaptations are therefore, as such, an argument for the gradual\r\ntransformation of species. But he assumed that such exact adaptations\r\nto the functions of an organ could only arise through the exercise of\r\nthat function, and in this he saw a proof of transformation. Goethe had\r\nexpressed the same idea when he said, 'Thus the eagle has conformed\r\nitself through the air to the air, the mole through the earth to the\r\nearth, and the seal through the water to the water,' and this shows\r\nthat he too at one time thought of an actual transformation. But\r\nneither he nor Erasmus Darwin were at all clear as to _how_ the use\r\nof an organ could bring about its variation and transformation. The\r\nlatter only says that, for instance, the snout of the pig has become\r\nhard through its constant grubbing in the ground; the trunk of the\r\nelephant has acquired its great mobility through the perpetual use of\r\nit for all sorts of purposes; the tongue of the herbivore owes its\r\nhard, grater-like condition to the rubbing to and fro of the hard grass\r\nin the mouth, and so on. How acute and thoughtful an observer Erasmus\r\nDarwin was, is shown by the fact that he had correctly appreciated the\r\nbiological significance of many of the colour-adaptations of animals\r\nto their surroundings, though it was reserved for his grandson to make\r\nthis fully clear at a much later date. Thus he regarded the varied\r\ncolouring of the python, of the leopard, and of the wild cat as the\r\nbest adapted for concealing them from their prey amid the play of light\r\nand shadow in a leafy thicket. The black spot in front of the eye of\r\nthe swan he considered an arrangement to prevent the bird from being\r\ndazzled, as would happen if that spot were as snow-white as the rest of\r\nthe plumage.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the book he sums up his views in the following\r\nsentences: 'The world has been evolved, not created; it has arisen\r\nlittle by little from a small beginning, and has increased through\r\nthe activity of the elemental forces embodied in itself, and so has\r\nrather grown than suddenly come into being at an almighty word.' 'What\r\na sublime idea of the infinite might of the great Architect! the Cause\r\nof all causes, the Father of all fathers, the Ens entium! For if we\r\ncould compare the Infinite it would surely require a greater Infinite\r\nto cause the causes of effects than to produce the effects themselves.'\r\n\r\nIn these words he sets forth his position in regard to religion, and\r\ndoes so in precisely the same terms as we may use to-day when we say:\r\n'All that happens in the world depends on the forces that prevail in\r\nit, and results according to law; but where these forces and their\r\nsubstratum, Matter, come from, we know not, and here we have room for\r\nfaith.'\r\n\r\nI have not been able to discover whether the _Zoonomia_, with its\r\nrevolutionary ideas, attracted much attention at the time when it\r\nappeared, but it would seem not. In any case, it was afterwards so\r\nabsolutely forgotten, that in an otherwise very complete _History of\r\nZoology_, published in 1872 by Victor Carus, it was not even mentioned.\r\nAbout a year after the appearance of _Zoonomia_, Isidore Geoffrey\r\nSt.-Hilaire in Paris expounded the view that what are called species\r\nare really only 'degenerations,' deteriorations from one and the same\r\ntype, which shows that he too had begun to have doubts as to the fixity\r\nof species. Yet it was not till the third decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that he clearly and definitely took up the position of the\r\ndoctrine of transformation, and to this we shall have to return later\r\non.\r\n\r\nBut as early as the first decade of the century this position was taken\r\nup by two noteworthy naturalists, a German and a Frenchman, Treviranus\r\nand Lamarck.\r\n\r\nGottfried Reinhold Treviranus, born at Bremen in 1776, an excellent\r\nobserver and an ingenious investigator, published, in 1802, a book\r\nentitled _Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur_ [_Biology, or\r\nPhilosophy of Animate Nature_], in which he expresses and elaborates\r\nthe idea of the Evolution theory with perfect clearness. We read\r\nthere, for instance: 'In every living being there exists a capacity\r\nfor endless diversity of form; each possesses the power of adapting\r\nits organization to the variations of the external world, and it is\r\nthis power, called into activity by cosmic changes, which has enabled\r\nthe simple zoophytes of the primitive world to climb to higher and\r\nhigher stages of organization, and has brought endless variety into\r\nnature.' But where the motive power lies, which brings about these\r\ntransformations from the lowliest to ever higher forms of life, was a\r\nquestion which Treviranus apparently did not venture to discuss. To do\r\nthis, and thus to take the first step towards a causal explanation of\r\nthe assumed transformations, was left for his successor.\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste de Lamarck, born in 1744 in a village of Picardy, was\r\nfirst a soldier, then a botanist, and finally a zoologist. He won his\r\nscientific spurs first by his _Flora of France_, and zoology holds him\r\nin honour as the founder of the category of 'vertebrates.' Not that he\r\noccupied himself in particular detail with these, but he recognized the\r\nclose alliance of the classes of animals in question--an alliance which\r\nwas subsequently expressed by Cuvier by the systematic term 'type' or\r\n'embranchement.'\r\n\r\nIn his _Philosophie zoologique_, published in 1809, Lamarck set\r\nforth a theory of evolution whose truth he attempted to vindicate by\r\nshowing--as Treviranus had done before him--that the conception of\r\nspecies, on the immutability of which the whole hypothesis of creation\r\nhad been based, was an artificial one, read into nature by us; that\r\nsharply circumscribed groups do not exist in nature at all; and that\r\nit is often very difficult, and not infrequently quite impossible, to\r\ndefine one species precisely from allied forms, because it is connected\r\nwith these on all sides by transition stages. Groups of forms which\r\nthus melted into one another indicated that the doctrine of the fixity\r\nof species could not be correct, any more than that of their absolute\r\nnature. Species, he maintained, are not immutable, and are not so old\r\nas nature; they are fixed only for a certain time. The shortness of\r\nour life prevents our directly recognizing this. 'If we lived a much\r\nshorter time, say about a second, the hour-hand of the clock would\r\nappear to us to stand still, and even the combined observations of\r\nthirty generations would afford no decisive evidence as to the hand's\r\nmovement, and yet it had been moving.'\r\n\r\nThe causes on which, according to Lamarck, the transformation of\r\nspecies, their modification into new species, depends, lie in the\r\nchanges in the conditions of life which must have occurred ceaselessly\r\nfrom the earliest period of the earth's history till our own day, now\r\nhere, now there, due in part to changes in climate and in food-supply,\r\nin part to changes in the earth's crust by the rising or sinking of\r\nland-masses, and so forth. These external changes have sometimes been\r\nthe _direct_ cause of changes in bodily structure, as in the case\r\nof heat or cold; but they have sometimes and much more effectively\r\noperated _indirectly_. Thus changed conditions may have prompted\r\nan animal of a given species to use certain parts of its body in a\r\nnew way, more vigorously, or less actively, or even not at all, and\r\nthe more vigorous use, or, conversely, the disuse, has brought about\r\nvariations in the organ in question.\r\n\r\nThus the whales lost their teeth when they abandoned their fish diet,\r\nand acquired the habit of feeding on minute and delicate molluscs,\r\nwhich they swallowed whole without seizure or mastication. Thus, too,\r\nthe eyes of the mole degenerated through its life in the dark, and a\r\nstill greater degeneration of the eyes has taken place in animals,\r\nlike the proteus-salamander, which always inhabit lightless caves.\r\nIn mussels both head and eyes degenerated because the animals could\r\nno longer use them after they became enclosed in opaque mantles and\r\nshells. In the same way snakes lost their legs _pari passu_ with the\r\nacquisition of the habit of moving along by wriggling their long\r\nbodies, and of creeping through narrow fissures and holes. On the\r\nother hand, Lamarck interpreted the evolution of the web-feet of\r\nswimming birds by supposing that some land-bird or other had formed the\r\nhabit of going into the water to seek for food, and consequently of\r\nspreading out its toes as widely as possible so as to strike the water\r\nmore vigorously. In this way the fold of skin between the toes was\r\nstretched, and as the extension of the toes was very frequent and was\r\ncontinued through many generations, the web expanded and grew larger,\r\nand thus formed the web-foot.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the long legs of the wading birds have been, according\r\nto Lamarck, gradually evolved by the continual stretching of the limbs\r\nby wading in deeper and deeper water, and similarly for the long necks\r\nand bills of the waders, the herons and the storks. Finally we may\r\nmention the case of the giraffe, whose enormously long neck and tall\r\nforelegs are interpreted as due to the fact that the animal feeds on\r\nthe foliage of trees, and was always stretching as far as possible, in\r\norder to reach the higher leaves.\r\n\r\nWe shall see later in what a different way Charles Darwin explained\r\nthis case of the giraffe. Lamarck's idea is at once clear; it is true\r\nthat exercising an organ strengthens it, that disuse makes it weaker.\r\nThrough much gymnastic exercise the muscles of the arm become thicker\r\nand more capable, and memory too may be improved, that is to say,\r\neven a definite part of the brain may be considerably strengthened\r\nby use. Indeed, we may now go so far as to admit that every organ is\r\nstrengthened by use and weakened by disuse, and so far the foundations\r\nof Lamarck's interpretations are sound. But he presupposes something\r\nthat cannot be admitted so readily, namely, that such 'functional'\r\nimprovement or diminution in the strength of an organ can be\r\ntransmitted by inheritance to the succeeding generation. We shall have\r\nto discuss this question in detail at a later stage, and I shall only\r\nsay now that opinions as to whether this is possible or not are very\r\nmuch divided. I myself doubt this possibility, and therefore cannot\r\nadmit the validity of the Lamarckian evolutionary principle in so far\r\nas it implies the directly transforming effect of the functioning of\r\nan organ. But even if we recognize the Lamarckian factor as a _vera\r\ncausa_, it is easy to show that there are a great many characters\r\nwhich it is not in a position to interpret. Many insects which live\r\nupon green leaves are green, and not a few of them possess exactly the\r\nshade of green which marks the plant on which they feed; they are thus\r\nprotected in a certain measure from injuries. But how could this green\r\ncolour of the skin have been brought about by the activity of the skin,\r\nsince the colour of the surroundings does not usually stimulate the\r\nskin to activity at all? Or how should a grasshopper, which is in the\r\nhabit of sitting on dry branches of herbs, have thereby been incited\r\nto an activity which imparts to it the colour and shape of a dry twig?\r\nJust as little, or perhaps still less, can the protective green colour\r\nof a bird's or insect's eggs be explained through the direct influence\r\nof their usually green surroundings, even if we disregard the fact that\r\nthe eggs are green when they are laid--that is, before the environment\r\ncan have had any influence on them.\r\n\r\nThe Lamarckian principle of modification through use does not, in\r\nany case, nearly suffice as an interpretation of the transformations\r\nof the organic world. It must be allowed that Lamarck's theory of\r\ntransformation was well founded at the time when it was advanced; it\r\nnot only attacked the doctrine of the immutability of species, but\r\nsought for the first time to indicate the forces and influences which\r\nmust be operative in the transformations of species; it was therefore\r\nwell worth careful testing. Nevertheless it did not divert science from\r\nits chosen path; very little notice was taken of it, and in the great\r\nCuvier's chronicle of scientific publications for 1809, not a syllable\r\nis devoted to Lamarck's book, so strong was the power of prejudice.\r\n\r\nBut, although the new doctrine was thus ignored, it did not altogether\r\nfall to the ground; it glimmered for a while in Germany, where it found\r\nits champions in the 'Naturphilosophie' of the time, and especially in\r\nLorenz Oken, a peasant's son, born at Ortenau, near Offenburg, in 1783.\r\n\r\nOken professed views similar to those of Erasmus Darwin, Treviranus,\r\nand Lamarck, though they were not clothed in such purely scientific\r\ngarb, being, in fact, bound up with the general philosophical\r\nspeculations which came increasingly into favour at that time, chiefly\r\nthrough the writings of Schelling. In the same year, 1809, in which\r\nLamarck published his _Philosophie zoologique_, Oken's _Lehrbuch der\r\nNaturphilosophie_ appeared.\r\n\r\nThis book is by no means simply a theory of descent; its scope is much\r\nwider, including the phenomena of the whole cosmos; on the other hand,\r\nit goes too little into details and is too indefinite to deserve its\r\ntitle. Its way of playing with ideas, its conjectures and inferences\r\nfrom a fanciful basis, make it difficult for us now to think ourselves\r\ninto its mode of speculation, but I should like to give some indication\r\nof it, for it was just these speculative encroachments of the\r\n'categories' of the so-called 'Naturphilosophie' which played a fatal\r\npart in causing the temporary disappearance of the Evolution-theory\r\nfrom science, so that, later on, it had to be established anew.\r\n\r\nOken defines natural science as 'the science of the everlasting\r\ntransmutations of God (the Spirit) in the world': Every thing,\r\nconsidered in the light of the genetic process of the whole, includes,\r\nbesides the idea of being, that of not-being, in that it is involved\r\nin a higher form. 'In these antitheses the category of polarity is\r\nincluded. The simpler elementary bodies unite into higher forms,\r\nwhich are thus merely repetitions at a potential higher than that of\r\ntheir causes. Thus the different genera of bodies form parallel and\r\ncorresponding series, the reasonable arrangement of which results as an\r\nintrinsic necessity from their genetic connexion. In individuals these\r\nlowlier series make their appearance again during development. The\r\ncontrasts in the solar system between planets and sun are repeated in\r\nplants and animals, and, as light is the principle of movement, animals\r\nhave the power of independent movement in advance of the plants which\r\nbelong to the earth.'\r\n\r\nObviously enough, this is no longer the study of nature; it is\r\nnature-construction from a basis of guesses and analogies rather than\r\nof knowledge and facts. Light is the principle of motion, and as\r\nanimals move, they correspond to the sun, and plants to the planets!\r\nHere there is not even a hint of a deepening of knowledge, and all\r\nthese deductions now seem to us quite worthless.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be allowed that good ideas are by no means\r\nabsent from this 'philosophy,' nor can we deny to this restlessly\r\nindustrious man a great mind always bent on discovering what was\r\ngeneral and essential. Much of what we now _know_ he even then guessed\r\nat and taught, as, for instance, that the basis of all forms of life\r\nin this infinitely diverse world of organisms was one and the same\r\nsubstance--'primitive slime,' 'Urschleim' as he called it, or, as we\r\nshould now say, 'protoplasm.' We can therefore, _mutatis mutandis_,\r\nagree with Oken when he says,'Everything organic has come from slime,\r\nand is nothing but diversely organized slime.' Many naturalists of the\r\npresent day would go further, and agree with Oken when he suggests\r\nthat 'this primitive slime has arisen in the sea, in the course of the\r\nplanet's (the earth's) evolution out of inorganic material.'\r\n\r\nThus Oken postulated, as the specific vehicle of life, a primitive\r\nsubstance, in essence at least homogeneous. But he went further, and\r\nmaintained that his 'Urschleim' assumed _the form of vesicles_, of\r\nwhich the various organisms were composed. 'The organic world has as\r\nits basis an infinitude of such vesicles.' Who is not at once reminded\r\nof the now dominant _Cell-theory_? And, in fact, thirty years later,\r\nwhen the cell was discovered, Oken did claim priority for himself. In\r\nso doing, he obviously confused the formulating of a problem with the\r\nsolving of it; he had, quite rightly, divined that organisms must be\r\nbuilt up of very minute concentrations of the primitive substance, but\r\nhe had never seen a cell, or proved the necessity for its existence, or\r\neven attempted to prove it. His vesicle-theory was a pure divination, a\r\nprevision of genius, but one which could not directly deepen knowledge;\r\nit did not prompt, or even hasten, the discovery of the cell. Here,\r\nas throughout in his natural philosophy, Oken built, not from beneath\r\nupwards, by first establishing facts and then drawing conclusions from\r\nthem, but, inversely, he invented ideas and principles, and out of\r\nthem reconstructed the world. In this he differs essentially from his\r\npredecessors Erasmus Darwin, Treviranus, and Lamarck, who all reasoned\r\ninductively, that is, from observed data.\r\n\r\nThus the whole evolutionary movement was lost in indefiniteness;\r\nbecause men wanted to find a reason for everything, they missed\r\neven what might then have been explained. Moreover, the theory of\r\nevolution still lacked a sufficiently broad basis of facts; the\r\n'Naturphilosophie,' by its want of moderation, robbed it of all\r\ncredit; and it is not to be wondered at that men soon ceased to occupy\r\nthemselves with the problem of the evolution of the living world. A few\r\nindeed held fast to the doctrine of evolution during the first third\r\nof the century, but then it disappeared completely from the realm of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nIts last flicker of life was seen in France, in 1830, at the time of\r\nthe July revolution, when the legitimate sovereignty of Charles X was\r\noverthrown. It is interesting to note the lively interest that Goethe,\r\nthe first forerunner of the theory, and then aged eighty-one, had in\r\nthe intellectual combat that took place in the French Academy between\r\nCuvier and Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire. A friend of Goethe's, Soret,\r\nrelates that on August 2, 1830, he went into the poet's room, and was\r\ngreeted with the words: 'Well, what do you think of this great event?\r\nThe volcano is in eruption, and all is in flames. There can no longer\r\nbe discussion with closed doors.' Soret replied: 'It is a terrible\r\nbusiness! But what else was to be expected with things as they are,\r\nand with such a ministry, than that it should end in the expulsion\r\nof the reigning family?' To which Goethe answered: 'We don't seem to\r\nunderstand each other, my dear friend. I am not talking of these people\r\nat all; I am thinking of quite different affairs. I refer to the open\r\nrupture in the Academy between Cuvier and Geoffroy St.-Hilaire; it is\r\nof the utmost importance to science.'\r\n\r\nIn this conflict of opinions, Cuvier opposed Geoffroy's conception of\r\nthe unity of the plan of structure in all animals, confronting him with\r\nthe four Cuvierian types, in each of which the plan of structure was\r\naltogether different, and strongly insisting on the doctrine of the\r\nfixity of species, which he maintained to be the necessary postulate of\r\na scientific natural history.\r\n\r\nThe victory fell to Cuvier, and it cannot be denied that there was much\r\njustification for his opinions at the time, for the knowledge of facts\r\nat that stage was not nearly comprehensive enough to give security to\r\nthe Evolution theory, and moreover the quiet progress of science might\r\nhave been hindered rather than furthered by premature generalization\r\nand theorizing. It had now been seen how far the interpretation of\r\ngeneral biological problems could be carried with the available\r\nmaterial; the 'Naturphilosophie' had not merely exploited it as far as\r\npossible, but had burdened it much beyond its carrying power, and the\r\nworld was weary of insecure speculations. The 'Naturphilosophie' was\r\nfor the time quite worked out, and a long period set in, during which\r\nall energies were devoted to detailed research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE II\r\n\r\nTHE DARWINIAN THEORY\r\n\r\n Period of detailed research--Appearance of Darwin's _Origin\r\n of Species_--Darwin's life--Voyage round the world--His\r\n teaching--Domesticated animals, dog, horse--Pigeons--Artificial\r\n selection--Unconscious selection--Correlated variations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE period of wholly unphilosophical, purely detailed research may be\r\nreckoned as from about 1830 to 1860, though, of course, many of the\r\nlabours of the earlier part of the century must be counted among the\r\ninvestigations which were carried out without any reference to general\r\nquestions, and even after 1860 numerous such works appeared. Nor could\r\nit be otherwise, for the basis of all science must be found in facts,\r\nand the thorough working up of the fact-material will always remain\r\nthe first and most indispensable condition of our scientific progress.\r\nDuring the period referred to, however, it had become the sole end to\r\nbe striven for; and all energies were concentrated exclusively on the\r\naccumulation of facts.\r\n\r\nThe previous century had added much to the knowledge of the inner\r\nstructure of animals, the so-called 'comparative anatomy,' and in\r\nthe nineteenth century this line of investigation was pursued even\r\nmore extensively and energetically, so that the knowledge increased\r\nenormously. Up till this time it was chiefly the structure of the\r\nbackboned animals and of a few 'backboneless' animals, so called, that\r\nhad been studied, but now all the lower groups of the animal kingdom\r\nwere also investigated, and became known better and in more detail as\r\nthe methods of research improved.\r\n\r\nNot content, however, with a knowledge of the adult animal, naturalists\r\nbegan to investigate its development. In the year 1814 the first\r\ngreat work on development appeared, on the development of the chick,\r\nby Pander and Von Baer. It was there shown for the first time, how\r\nthe chick begins as a little disk-shaped membrane on the surface of\r\nthe yolk of the egg, at first simply as a pale streak, the 'primitive\r\nstreak,' then as a groove, the 'primitive groove,' by the side of which\r\narise two folds, the 'medullary folds,' and further how a system of\r\nblood-vessels is developed around this primitive rudiment on the upper\r\nsurface of the yolk, how a heart arises before the rest of the body is\r\ncomplete, and how the blood begins to circulate; in short, there was\r\ndisclosed all the marvel of development to which we are now so much\r\naccustomed, that we can hardly understand the sensation it made at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLater on, attention was turned to the development of Fishes and\r\nAmphibians (Agassiz and Vogt, later Remak), then to that of the Worms\r\n(Bagge), of Insects (Kölliker), and gradually the development of\r\nall the groups of the animal-kingdom--from Sponges to Man--was so\r\nthoroughly investigated that it almost seems to-day as if there could\r\nnot be much that is new to discover in this department. This impression\r\nmay indeed be true as far as the less complex processes and the more\r\nobvious questions are concerned, but it is impossible to predict what\r\nnew problems may confront us, whose solution will depend on a still\r\nmore detailed study of development.\r\n\r\nAs embryology is a science of the nineteenth century, so also is\r\nhistology, the science of tissues. Its pioneer was Bichat, but its\r\nreal foundations were not laid till Schwann and Schleiden formulated\r\nthe conception of the 'cell,' and proved that all animals and plants\r\nwere composed of cells. What Oken had only guessed at they now proved,\r\nthat there are very minute form-elements of life which build up all the\r\nparts of animals and plants or produce them by processes of secretion.\r\nNew light was thus shed on embryonic development, and this gradually\r\nled to the recognition of the fact that the egg, too, is a cell, and\r\nthat development depends on a cell-division process in this egg-cell.\r\nThis led further to the conception of many-celled and single-celled\r\norganisms, and so on to many items of knowledge to speak of which here\r\nwould carry us too far.\r\n\r\nFor it is not my intention to attempt a complete review of the\r\ndevelopment of biology in the nineteenth century, or even in the\r\nperiod which we have mentioned as devoted to detailed research; it\r\nis rather my desire to convey a general impression of the enormous\r\nextent and many-sidedness of the progress that was made in this time.\r\nLet us therefore briefly recall the entirely new facts which were\r\nbrought to light in this period with regard to the reproduction of\r\nanimals. Asexual reproduction by budding and division was already\r\nknown, but parthenogenesis is a discovery of this period, and so also\r\nis alternation of generations, so far-reaching in its bearing on\r\ngeneral problems. It was first observed (1819) by Chamisso in Salpa,\r\nthen by Steenstrup in Medusæ and trematodes, and was later made fully\r\nclear in its most diverse forms and relations by the researches of\r\nLeuckart, Vogt, Kölliker, Gegenbaur, Agassiz, and other illustrious\r\ninvestigators. Reproduction by heterogony, too, which occurs in\r\nmany crustaceans, and in aphides and certain worms, was recognized\r\nat that time, and in the sixties Carl Ernst von Baer added to the\r\nlist precocious reproduction, or pædogenesis, which is illustrated in\r\ncertain insects which reproduce in the larval state.\r\n\r\nThis may suffice to convey some idea of the great mass of new, and in\r\nsome cases startling facts previously unguessed at, which were then\r\nbrought to light in the department of animal biology alone. To this\r\nmust be added the vast increase in the number of known species and\r\nvarieties, their distribution on the earth, and all this, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, for plants also. Nor can we omit to mention the rapidly\r\ngrowing number of fossil species of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThus there gradually accumulated a new mass of material; investigation\r\nbecame more and more specialized, and the danger became imminent that\r\nworkers in the various departments would be unable to understand\r\neach other, so completely were they independent of one another in\r\ntheir specialist researches. There was lack of any unifying bond, for\r\nworkers had lost sight of the general problem in which all branches\r\nof the science meet, and through which alone they can be united into\r\na general science of biology. The time had come for again combining\r\nand correlating the details, lest they should grow into an unconnected\r\nchaos, through which it would be impossible to find one's way, because\r\nno one could overlook it and grasp it as a whole. In a word, it was\r\nhigh time to return to general questions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough I have called the period from 1830 to 1860 that of purely\r\ndetailed research, I do not mean to ignore the fact that, during that\r\ntime, there were a few feeble attempts to return to the great questions\r\nwhich had been raised at the beginning of the century. But the point\r\nis, that all such attempts remained unnoticed. Thus there appeared, in\r\n1844, a book entitled _Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation_,\r\nthe anonymous author of which revealed himself much later as Robert\r\nChambers, an Edinburgh publisher. In this book the evolution of species\r\nwas ascribed to two powers, a power of transformation and a power of\r\nadaptation. Two Frenchmen, Naudin and Lecoq, also published a work in\r\nwhich the theory of evolution was set forth, and from 1852 to 1854 the\r\nwell-known German anthropologist Schaafhausen was writing on similar\r\nlines. But all these calls sounded unheard, so deeply were naturalists\r\nplunged in detailed investigations, and it required a much mightier\r\nvoice to command the ear of the scientific world.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the effect of Darwin's book on _The\r\nOrigin of Species_, published in English in 1858, in German in 1859\r\nunless we fully realize how completely the biologists of that time\r\nhad turned away from general problems. I can only say that we, who\r\nwere then the younger men, studying in the fifties, had no idea that\r\na theory of evolution had ever been put forward, for no one spoke of\r\nit to us, and it was never mentioned in a lecture. It seemed as if all\r\nthe teachers in our universities had drunk of the waters of Lethe,\r\nand had utterly forgotten that such a theory had ever been discussed,\r\nor as if they were ashamed of these philosophical flights on the part\r\nof natural science, and wished to guard their students from similar\r\ndeviations. The over-speculation of the 'Naturphilosophie' had left in\r\ntheir minds a deep antipathy to all far-reaching deductions, and, in\r\ntheir legitimate striving after purely inductive investigation, they\r\nforgot that the mere gathering of facts is not enough, that the drawing\r\nof conclusions is an essential part of the induction, and that a mass\r\nof bare facts, however enormous, does not constitute a science.\r\n\r\nOne of my most stimulating teachers at that time, the gifted anatomist,\r\nJacob Henle, had written as a motto under his picture, 'There is a\r\nvirtue of renunciation, not in the province of morality alone, but\r\nin that of intellect as well,' a sentence which expressly indicated\r\nthe desirability of refraining from all attempts to probe into the\r\nmore general problems of life. Thus the young students of that time\r\nwere nourished only on the results of detailed research, in part\r\nindeed interesting enough, but in part dry and, because uncorrelated,\r\nunintelligible in the higher sense, and only here and there awakening a\r\ndeeper interest, when, as in physiology and in embryology, they formed\r\na connected system in themselves. Without being fully clear as to what\r\nwas lacking, we certainly missed the deeper correlation of the many\r\nseparate disciplines.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not to be wondered that Darwin's book fell like a\r\nbolt from the blue; it was eagerly devoured, and while it excited in\r\nthe minds of the younger students delight and enthusiasm, it aroused\r\namong the older naturalists anything from cool aversion to violent\r\nopposition. The world was as though thunderstruck, as we can readily\r\nsee from the preface with which the excellent zoologist of Heidelberg,\r\nBronn, introduced his translation of Darwin's book, where he asks this\r\nquestion among others, 'How will it be with you, dear reader, after you\r\nhave read this book?' and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut before I enter on a detailed examination of the contents of this\r\nepoch-making book, I should like to say a few words about the man\r\nhimself, who thus revolutionized our thinking.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was born in 1809, the year of the publication of\r\nLamarck's _Philosophie zoologique_, and of Oken's _Lehrbuch der\r\nNaturphilosophie_. There was thus a whole generation between the first\r\nemergence of the Evolution theory and its later revival. Darwin's\r\nfather was a physician, and his education was not a regular one. In his\r\nyouth he seems to have devoted much time and enthusiasm to hunting, and\r\nonly very slowly to have taken up regular studies towards a definite\r\nend. In accordance with his father's wishes, he studied medicine for a\r\ntime, but soon abandoned it to devote himself to botany and zoology.\r\nBefore he had had time to distinguish himself in any special way in\r\nthese subjects, he was offered, in his twenty-first year, the post of\r\nnaturalist on an English war-ship which was to make a voyage round the\r\nworld, and that at a leisurely rate.\r\n\r\nThis was decisive not only for Darwin's immediate studies, but for\r\nthe work of his life, for, as he tells us himself, it was during this\r\nvoyage on the _Beagle_ that the idea of the Evolution theory first came\r\nto him. While the vessel made a stay at the Galapagos Islands, west\r\nof South America, he noticed that quite a number of little land-birds\r\noccurred there which closely resembled those of the neighbouring\r\nmainland, but yet were different from them. Almost every little island\r\nhad its own species, and so he concluded that all these might be\r\ndescended from representatives of a few species which had long before\r\ndrifted over from the mainland to these volcanic islands, become\r\nestablished there, and in the course of time taken on the character of\r\nnew species. The problem of the transformation of species opened up\r\nbefore him, and he made up his mind to follow up the idea after his\r\nreturn, in the hope that by a patient collecting of facts, he would by\r\nand by arrive at some security with regard to this great question.\r\n\r\nI need not linger over any detailed account of his travels; one can\r\nreadily understand how a voyage round the world, lasting for five\r\nyears, would offer to the inquiring mind of a Darwin rich opportunities\r\nfor the most varied observations. That he did not fail to make use of\r\nthese is evidenced not only by his book on _The Origin of Species_, but\r\nby several more special works, published shortly after his return--his\r\nnatural history of those remarkable sessile crustaceans, the barnacles\r\nor Cirripedia, and his studies on the origin of coral reefs. The\r\nfirst-named book still holds its own as a classic monograph on this\r\nanimal group, with its wealth of forms; and the theory of the origin of\r\ncoral reefs which Darwin elaborated has still many adherents, in spite\r\nof various rival interpretations.\r\n\r\nBut Darwin would hardly have achieved what he did if he had been\r\ncompelled to secure for himself a professional position in order to\r\nobtain bread and butter. Such great problems demand not only the whole\r\nof a man's mental energy, they monopolize his time. Studies of detail\r\nmay well be taken up in leisure hours, but big problems absorb all the\r\nthoughts and must always be present to the mind, lest the connexion\r\nbetween the many individual inquiries, which make up the whole task, be\r\nlost sight of. Darwin had the good fortune to be a free investigator,\r\nand to be able to retire, on his return from his travels, to a small\r\nproperty at Down in Kent, there to live for his family and his work.\r\nHere he followed up the idea of evolution which he had already\r\nformulated, and it has always seemed to me the most remarkable thing\r\nabout him, that he was able to keep in mind and work up the hundreds\r\nof isolated inquiries that were eventually to be brought together to\r\nform the main fabric of his theory. When one studies his many later\r\nwritings, one cannot but be surprised afresh by the number of different\r\nsets of facts he collected at the same time, partly from others,\r\npartly from personal observation, and continually also from his own\r\nexperiments. He made experiments on plants and on animals, and the\r\nnumber of people with whom he carried on a scientific correspondence\r\nis simply astounding. In this way he brought together, in the course\r\nof twenty years, an extraordinarily rich material of facts, from the\r\nfullness of which he was able later to write his book on _The Origin\r\nof Species_. Never before had a theory of evolution been so thoroughly\r\nprepared for, and it is undoubtedly to this that it owed a great part\r\nof its success; not to this alone, however, but still more, if not\r\nmainly, to the fact that it presented a principle of interpretation\r\nthat had never before been thought of, but whose importance was\r\napparent as soon as attention was called to it--the principle of\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin championed, in the main, the same fundamental ideas as\r\nhad been promulgated by his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, by Treviranus,\r\nand by Lamarck: species only seem to us immutable; in reality they can\r\nvary, and become transformed into other species, and the living world\r\nof our day has arisen through such transformations, through a sublime\r\nprocess of evolution which began with the lowest forms of life, but\r\nby degrees, in the course of unthinkably long ages, progressed to\r\norganisms more and more complex in structure, more and more effective\r\nin function.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note at what point Darwin first put in his lever\r\nto attempt the solution of the problem of evolution. He started from\r\nquite a different point from the investigators of the early part of\r\nthe century, for he began with forms of life which had previously\r\nbeen markedly neglected by science, the varieties of our domesticated\r\nanimals and cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nPreviously these had been in a sense mere step-children of biology,\r\ninconvenient existences which would not fit properly into the system,\r\nwhich were therefore as far as possible ignored or dismissed as outside\r\nthe scope of 'the natural,' because it was difficult to know what else\r\nto do with them. I can quite well remember that, even as a boy, I was\r\nstruck by the fact that one could find nothing in the systematic books\r\nabout the many well-established garden forms of plants, or about our\r\ndomestic animals, which seemed to be regarded as in a sense artificial\r\nproducts, and as such not worthy of scientific consideration. But it\r\nwas in these that Darwin particularly interested himself, making them\r\nvirtually the basis of his theory, for he led up from them to the very\r\nprinciple of transformation, which was his most important addition to\r\nthe earlier presentations of the Evolution theory.\r\n\r\nHe started from the existence of varieties which may be observed in\r\nso many wild species. His line of thought was somewhat as follows: If\r\nspecies have really arisen through a gradual process of transformation,\r\nthen varieties must be regarded as possible first steps towards new\r\nspecies; if, therefore, we can only succeed in finding out the causes\r\nwhich underlie the formation of any varieties whatever, we shall have\r\ndiscovered the causes of the transformation of species. Now we find by\r\nfar the greatest number of varieties, and the most marked ones, among\r\nour domesticated animals and plants, and unless we are to assume that\r\neach of these is descended from a special wild species, the reason why\r\nthere has been such a wealth of variety-formation among them must lie\r\nin the conditions which influence the relevant species in the course of\r\ndomestication; and it remains for us to analyse these conditions till\r\nwe come upon the track of the operative factors. With this conviction,\r\nDarwin devoted himself to the study of domesticated animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe first essential was to prove that every variety had not a separate\r\nwild species as ancestor, but that the whole wealth of our domesticated\r\nbreeds originated, in each case, from one, or at least from a few wild\r\nspecies. Of course I cannot here recapitulate the multitudinous facts\r\nwhich were marshalled by Darwin, especially in his later works, notably\r\nhis _Animals and Plants under Domestication_, but this is not necessary\r\nto an understanding of his conclusions, and I shall therefore restrict\r\nmyself to a few examples.\r\n\r\nLet us take first the domestic dog, _Canis familiaris_, Linné. We\r\nhave at the present day no fewer than seven main breeds, each of\r\nwhich has its sub-breeds, often numerous. Thus there are forty-eight\r\nsub-breeds which are used as guardians of our houses, 'house-dogs'\r\nin the restricted sense, thirty sub-breeds of dogs with silk-like\r\nhair (King Charles dogs, Newfoundland dogs, &c.), twelve of terriers,\r\nand thirty-five of sporting dogs, among them such different forms as\r\nthe deerhound and the pointer. We have further nineteen sub-breeds\r\nof bulldogs, thirty-five of greyhounds, and six of naked or hairless\r\ndogs. Not only the main breeds, but even the sub-breeds often differ\r\nas markedly from one another as wild species do, and the question must\r\nfirst be decided whether each of the very distinct breeds has not a\r\nspecial wild species as ancestor.\r\n\r\nObviously, however, this cannot be maintained, for so many species of\r\nwild dog have never existed on the earth at any time. We know, too,\r\nthat 4,000 or 5,000 years ago a large number of breeds of dogs were\r\nin existence in India and Egypt. There were Pariah dogs, coursers,\r\ngreyhounds, mastiffs, house-dogs, lapdogs and terriers. It is not\r\npossible that the products of all lands could, at that time, have been\r\ngathered into one, and it is inconceivable that so many wild species\r\ncould have existed in the one country of India.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, it cannot be maintained that all our\r\npresent breeds have descended from _a single_ wild species; it is much\r\nmore probable that several wild species were domesticated in different\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIt has often been supposed that the manifold diversity of our present\r\nbreeds has been brought about by crossing the various tamed species.\r\nThat cannot be the case, however, because crossing gives rise only to\r\nhybrid mongrel forms, not to distinct breeds with quite new characters.\r\nIt is true that all breeds of dogs can be very readily crossed with\r\neach other, but the result is not new breeds, but those numberless\r\nand transient intermediate forms which the dog-breeder despises as\r\nworthless for his purpose. It must therefore have been through the\r\ninfluence of domestication, combined with crossing, that a few wild\r\nspecies gave rise to the various breeds of dogs.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of the horse is rather more clear than that of the dog.\r\nEven in this case, indeed, one cannot definitely name the ancestral\r\nwild form, but it is very probable that it was of a grey-brown colour,\r\nand similar to the wild horses of our own day. Darwin supposes that\r\nit must also have had the black stripe on the back which is exhibited\r\nby the domestic ass, and by several wild species of ass, basing his\r\nopinion on the fact that the spinal stripe often occurs in foals,\r\nespecially in those of a grey-brown colour.\r\n\r\nBut though there can be no doubt that this is to be interpreted as a\r\nreversion to a character of a remote ancestor, it by no means follows\r\nthat the _direct_ ancestral form must have had this stripe. I am\r\nmore inclined to believe that the ancestor which bore this mark was\r\nconsiderably more remote, and lived before the differentiation of the\r\nhorse from the ass. Darwin himself noted the remarkable fact that in\r\nrare cases, especially in foals, not only may the stripe on the back be\r\npresent, but there may be more or less distinct zebra-striping on the\r\nlegs and withers: this, however, must be interpreted as a reversion to\r\nthe character of a very much more remote ancestor, to a common ancestor\r\nof all our present-day horses and asses, which must have been striped\r\nover its whole body, like the zebra living in Africa now.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be proved of any of the wild horses of to-day that they are\r\nnot descended from domesticated ancestors; indeed, we can say with\r\ncertainty that the thousands of wild horses which roam the plains of\r\nNorth and South America are descended from domestic horses, for there\r\nwas no horse in America at the time it was discovered by the Europeans.\r\nIn all probability our horse originated in Middle Asia, was there\r\nfirst domesticated, and has thence been gradually introduced into\r\nother countries. In Egypt it appears first on the monuments in the\r\nseventeenth century B.C., and it seems to have been introduced by the\r\nconquering Hyksos. On the ancient Assyrian monuments the chase after\r\nwild horses is depicted, and they were not caught, but killed with\r\narrow and lance, like the lion and the gazelle.\r\n\r\nBut even if two wild species of horse had been tamed in different parts\r\nof the great continent of Asia, these two domesticated animals would\r\nhave varied much and in the most diverse manner, as we may infer from\r\nour different breeds of horses at the present day. There are a great\r\nmany of these, and many of them differ very considerably from each\r\nother. If we think of the lightly built Arab horse, and place beside\r\nit the little pony, or the enormous Percheron, the powerful cart-horse\r\nfrom the old French province of La Perche, which easily draws a load of\r\nfifty kilograms, we are face to face with differences as great as those\r\nbetween natural species. And we may realize how many breeds of horses\r\nthere are now upon the earth if we remember that nearly every oceanic\r\nisland has its special breed of ponies. Not only in the cold Shetland\r\nIslands, England, Sardinia and Corsica, but in almost every one of the\r\nlarger islands of the extensive Indian Archipelago there is one, and\r\nBorneo and Sumatra have several.\r\n\r\nBut the most conclusive proof of descent from a single wild species\r\nis afforded by the pigeons, and as the production of new breeds among\r\nthem has been, and will continue to be, carried on with particular\r\nenthusiasm and deliberateness, I propose to deal with them somewhat\r\nmore in detail.\r\n\r\nDarwin's work proves beyond a doubt that all our present-day breeds\r\nof pigeons are descended from a single wild species, the rock-dove,\r\n_Columba livia_. In appearance, this form, which still lives in a wild\r\nstate, differs little from our half-wild blue-grey field-pigeon. It has\r\nthe same metallic shimmer on the feathers of the neck, the same two\r\nblack cross-bars on the wings as well as the band over the tail, and it\r\nhas also the same slate-blue general colour. Now, all breeds of pigeons\r\nare without restriction fertile _inter se_, so that any breed can be\r\ncrossed with any other, and it often happens that, in the products\r\nof such crossing, characters appear which the parents, that is, the\r\ntwo or more crossed breeds, did not possess, but which are among the\r\ncharacters of the rock-dove. Thus Darwin obtained, by crossing a pure\r\nwhite fantail with a black barb, hybrids which were partly blackish\r\nbrown, partly mixed with white, but when he crossed these hybrids with\r\nothers from two breeds which were likewise not blue, and had no bars,\r\nhe obtained a slate-blue rock-pigeon, with bars on the wings and tail.\r\nWe shall inquire later on how far it is correct to regard such cases\r\nas reversions to remote ancestors, but if we take it for granted in\r\nthe meantime, we have here a proof of the descent of our breeds from a\r\nsingle wild species. This is corroborated, too, by everything that we\r\nknow about the distribution of the rock-pigeon and the place and time\r\nof its domestication. It still lives on the cliff-guarded shores of\r\nEngland, Brittany, Portugal, and Spain, and both in India and in Egypt\r\nthere were tame pigeons at a very early period. Pigeons appear on the\r\nmenu of a Pharaoh of the fourth dynasty (3000 B.C.), and of India we\r\nknow at least that in 1600 A.D. there were 20,000 pigeons belonging to\r\nthe court of one of the princes.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this bird, and the ease with which it can be tamed,\r\nobviously called man's attention to it at a very early date, and it has\r\nbeen one of man's domestic companions for several thousands of years.\r\nNow we can distinguish at least twenty main races (Fig. 1), which\r\ndiffer from each other as markedly as, if not more markedly than, the\r\nmost nearly allied of the 288 wild species of pigeons which inhabit the\r\nearth. We have carriers and tumblers, runts and barbs, pouters, turbits\r\nand Jacobins, trumpeters and laughers, fantails, swallows, Indian\r\npigeons, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Group of various races of domestic pigeons\r\n(after Prütz). 1. Pouter. 2. Indian barb. 3. Bucharest trumpeter with\r\na whorl of feathers (_Nelke_) on its forehead. 4. Nürnberger swallow.\r\n5. Nürnberger bagadotte. 6. English carrier. 7. Fantail. 8. Eastern\r\nturbit. 9. Schmalkaldener Jacobin. 10. Chinese owl. 11. German turbit.]\r\n\r\nEach of these races falls into sub-races; thus there is a German, an\r\nEnglish, and a Dutch pouter-pigeon. The books on pigeons mention over\r\n150 kinds which are quite distinct from one another, and breed true,\r\nthat is, always produce young similar to themselves.\r\n\r\nWithout entering upon a detailed description of any of these, I should\r\nlike to call attention to the way in which certain characters have\r\nvaried among them. Colour is a subordinate race-character, in so far\r\nthat colour alone does not constitute a race, yet the colouring within\r\na particular sub-race is usually very sharply defined, and in every\r\nbreed there are sub-races of different colours. Thus there are white,\r\nblack, and blue fantails, there are white turbits with red-brown wings,\r\nbut also red ones with white heads, and white tumblers with black\r\nheads, &c. Very unusual colours and colour-markings sometimes occur.\r\nThus one sub-race of tumblers exhibits a peculiar clayey-yellow colour\r\nsplashed with black markings, otherwise rare among pigeons, and almost\r\nsuggestive of a prairie-hen; there is also a copper-red spot-pigeon, a\r\ncherry-red 'Gimpel'-pigeon, lark-coloured pigeons, &c. Then we find all\r\npossible juxtapositions of colours, limited to quite definite regions\r\nof the body; thus we have white tumblers with a red head, red tail,\r\nand red wing-tips, or white tumblers with a black head, red turbits\r\nwith white head, Indian pigeons quite black except for white wing-tips,\r\nand so on. The distribution of colour is often very complicated, but\r\nnevertheless, all the individuals of the breed show it in exactly the\r\nsame manner. Thus there are the so-called blondinettes in which almost\r\nthe whole body is copper-red, but the wings white, save that each quill\r\nbears at the rounded end of its vane a black and red fringe. I should\r\nnever come to an end, if I were to try to give anything like a complete\r\nidea of the diversity of colouring among the various breeds of pigeons.\r\n\r\nEven such an important and, among wild species, unusually constant\r\norgan as the bill has varied among pigeons to an astonishing degree.\r\nCarrier-pigeons (Fig. 1, No. 6) have an enormously long and strong\r\nbill, which is moreover covered with a thick red growth of the cere,\r\nwhile in the turbits and owls (Fig. 1, Nos. 8 and 10) the bill is\r\nshorter than any we find among wild birds. In many breeds even the\r\n_form_ of the bill deviates far from the normal, as in the bagadottes\r\n(No. 5) with crooked bill.\r\n\r\nLike the bill, the legs vary in regard to their length. The pouters\r\n(No. 1) stand on their long legs as on stilts, while the legs of the\r\n'Nürnberger swallow' are strikingly small. Remarkable, too, and very\r\ndifferent from the wild species, is the thick growth of feathers on the\r\nfeet and toes of the pouters and trumpeters (Fig. 1, No. 1), as well\r\nas of some other breeds, which suggests the arrangement of feathers on\r\na wing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the number and size of wing and tail-feathers in the\r\ndifferent breeds often deviate considerably from the normal. The\r\nfantail (No. 7) in its most perfect form possesses forty tail-feathers,\r\ninstead of the twelve usual in the wild rock-pigeon, and they are\r\ncarried upright like a fan, while the head and neck of the bird are\r\nbent sharply backwards. In the hen-like pigeons the tail-feathers are\r\nfew and short, so that they show an upright tail like that of a hen. I\r\nhave already referred to the extraordinary carunculated skin-growth on\r\nthe bill of many breeds; such folds also often surround the eye, and,\r\nas in the Indian barb (No. 3), are developed into well-formed thick\r\ncircular ridges, while in the English carrier (No. 6) they lie about\r\nthe bill as a formless mass of flesh.\r\n\r\nEven the skull has undergone many variations, as can be observed\r\neven in the living bird in many of the breeds with short forehead.\r\nDifferences are to be found, too, in the number and breadth of the\r\nribs, the length of the breast-bone, the number and size of the\r\ntail-vertebræ in different breeds. Of the internal organs, the crop in\r\nmany breeds, but particularly in the pouters (No. 1), has attained an\r\nenormous size, and with this size is usually associated the habit of\r\nblowing it out with air, and assuming the characteristically upright\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThat variations have taken place, too, in the most delicate structure\r\nof the brain, is shown by certain new instincts, such as the trumpeting\r\nof the trumpeters, the cooing of others, and the silence of yet other\r\nbreeds, as well as by the curious habit of the tumblers of ascending\r\nquickly and vertically to a considerable height, and then turning\r\nover once, or even several times, in the course of their descent. In\r\ncontrast to this, other breeds like the fantails have altogether given\r\nup the habit of flying high, and usually remain close to the dove-cot.\r\n\r\nLastly, let me mention that the unusual development of individual\r\nfeathers, or of groups of feathers, has become a race-character, upon\r\nwhich depend such remarkable structures as the feather-mantle turned\r\nover the head in the Jacobins (No. 9), the cap or plume on the head of\r\nvarious breeds, the white beard in the bearded tumbler, the collars\r\nwhich lie like a shirt-collar on the breast, or run down the sides of\r\nthe neck (Nos. 8 and 10), and the circle of feathers which marks the\r\nroot of the bill in the Bucharest trumpeter (No. 3).\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said, it is hardly necessary to add that the size\r\nof the whole body differs in different races. But the differences\r\nare very considerable, for, according to Darwin, one of the largest\r\nrunt-pigeons weighed exactly five times as much as one of the smallest\r\ntumblers with short forehead, and in the illustration (Fig. 1) the\r\npouter looks a giant beside the little barb to its left.\r\n\r\nThus we see that nearly every part of the body of the pigeon has varied\r\nunder domestication in the most diverse ways, and to a high degree;\r\nand the same is true of several other domesticated animals, poultry,\r\nhorses, sheep, cattle, pigs, and so on, though the matter is not\r\naltogether so clear in their case, since descent from a single wild\r\nspecies cannot be proved, and is in many cases improbable. But in the\r\ncase of pigeons this common descent is certain, and we have now to\r\ninquire in what manner all these variations from the parent form have\r\nbeen brought about.\r\n\r\nThe answering of this question is rendered easier by the fact that new\r\nbreeds arise even now, and that, to some extent at least, they can be\r\ncaused to arise, consciously and intentionally. In England, as well\r\nas in Germany and France, there are associations for the breeding of\r\nbirds, and in England especially pigeon and poultry clubs are numerous\r\nand highly developed. These by no means confine themselves to simply\r\npreserving the purity of existing breeds, they are continually striving\r\nto improve them, by increasing and accentuating their characters, or\r\neven by introducing quite new qualities, and in many cases they succeed\r\neven in this last. Prizes are offered for particular new variations,\r\nand thus a spirit of rivalry is fostered among the breeders, and each\r\nstrives to produce the desired character as quickly as possible. Darwin\r\nsays: 'The English judges decided that the comb of the Spanish cock,\r\nwhich had previously hung limply down, should stand erect, and in\r\nfive years this end was achieved; they ordained that hens should have\r\nbeards, and six years later fifty-seven of the groups of hens exhibited\r\nat the Crystal Palace in London were bearded.' The transformation\r\ndoes not always come about so quickly, however; thus, for instance,\r\nit required thirteen years before a certain breed of tumblers was\r\nfurnished with a white head. But the breeders cause every visible part\r\nof the body to vary as seems good to them, and within the last fifty\r\nyears they have really brought about very considerable changes in many\r\nbreeds. Their method of procedure is carefully to select for breeding\r\nthose birds which already possess a faint beginning of the desired\r\ncharacter. Domesticated animals have on the whole a higher degree of\r\nvariability than wild species, and the breeder takes advantage of\r\nthis. Suppose it is a question of adding a crown of feathers to a\r\nsmooth-headed breed, a bird is chosen which has the feathers on the\r\nback of the head a little longer than usual, and mated for breeding.\r\nAmong its descendants there will probably be some which also exhibit\r\nthese slightly prominent feathers, and possibly there may be one or\r\nother of them which has these feathers considerably lengthened. This\r\none is then used for breeding, and by continually proceeding thus,\r\nand selecting for breeding, from generation to generation, only\r\nthe individuals which approach most nearly to the desired end, the\r\nwished-for character is at last secured.\r\n\r\nThus it is not by crossing of different breeds, but by a patient\r\naccumulating of insignificant little variations through many\r\ngenerations, that the desired transformations are brought about. That\r\nis the magic wand by means of which the expert breeder produces his\r\ndifferent breeds, we might almost say, as the sculptor moulds and\r\nremoulds his clay model according to his fancy. Quite according to his\r\nfancy the breeder has brought about all the fantastic forms we are\r\nfamiliar with among pigeons, mere variations which are of no use either\r\nto the bird itself or to man, which simply gratify man's whim without\r\nin many cases even satisfying his sense of beauty. For many of the\r\nexisting breeds of pigeons, hens, and other domesticated animals, are\r\nanything but beautiful, the body being often unharmonious in structure\r\nand sometimes actually monstrous.\r\n\r\nAmong pigeons, as well as among other domesticated animals, some\r\nchanges have been brought about, which are not only of no use to their\r\npossessors, but would be actually disadvantageous if they were living\r\nunder natural conditions. Some of the very short-billed breeds of\r\npigeons have the bill so short and soft that the young can no longer\r\nuse it to scratch and break the egg-shell, and would perish miserably\r\nif human aid were not at hand. The Yorkshire pig has become such a\r\ncolossus of fat on weak, short legs, that if it were dependent on\r\nits own resources, it could not secure its food, much less escape\r\nfrom a beast of prey; and among horses the heavy cart-horse and the\r\nracer are alike unfit to cope with the dangers of a wild life, or the\r\nvicissitudes of weather.\r\n\r\nBreeding has done much to bring about variations useful to man. Thus we\r\nhave breeds of cattle which excel in flesh, or in milk, or as draught\r\nanimals, and sheep which excel in flesh or in wool, and to what a\r\nheight the perfecting of a useful quality can be brought is shown, in\r\nregard to fineness of wool, by that finest breed of sheep, the merino,\r\nwhich instead of the 5,500 hairs borne by the old German sheep on a\r\nsquare inch, possesses 48,000.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently it is a particular stage of a species that has\r\nbeen bred by man, and the other stages have remained more or less\r\nunaltered. Thus it is with one of the few domesticated insects, the\r\nsilk-moth. Only the cocoon is of use to man, and according to the\r\ncocoon different breeds are distinguished, differing in fineness,\r\ncolour, &c.; but no breeds can be distinguished in reference to the\r\nlarvæ, or the perfect insects. Among gooseberries there are about a\r\nhundred varieties distinguished according to the form, colour, size,\r\nthickness of skin, hairiness, &c., of the fruits, but the little,\r\ninconspicuous, green blossoms, of which the breeders take no account,\r\nare alike in them all. In the pansies (_Viola tricolor_), on the other\r\nhand, it is only by the flowers that the varieties are distinguished,\r\nwhile the seeds have remained alike in all.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how it could have occurred to any one, when pigeons,\r\nfor instance, first began to be domesticated, to wish to produce\r\nfantails or pouters, since he could have no mental picture of them\r\nin advance. Darwin replies to this objection, that it was not always\r\nconscious and methodical artificial selection, such as is now\r\npractised, that brought about the origin of breeds, but that they have\r\nvery often resulted, and at first perhaps always, from unconscious\r\nselection. When savages tamed a dog, they used the 'best' of their dogs\r\nfor breeding, that is, they chose those which had in the highest degree\r\nthe qualities they valued, watchfulness, for instance, or if the dog\r\nwere intended for the chase, keen scent and swiftness. In this way the\r\nbody of the animal would be changed in a definite direction, especially\r\nif rivalry helped, and if it was the ambition of each to possess a\r\ndog as good as, or better than those of his tribal companions. That\r\nperfectly definite changes in bodily form can thus be brought about\r\nunconsciously is well illustrated by the case of a racehorse. This has\r\narisen within the last two hundred years simply because the fleetest\r\nof the products of crossing between the Arab and the English horse\r\nwere always chosen for breeding. It could not have been predicted that\r\nhorses with thin neck, small head, long rump, and slender legs would\r\nnecessarily be the swiftest runners; but this is the form which has\r\nresulted from the selection,--a very ugly, but very swift horse. This\r\nunconscious selection must undoubtedly have played a large part in the\r\nearly stages of the evolution of the breeds of our domestic animals.\r\n\r\nBut even in the fully conscious and methodical selective breeding of\r\nparticular characters, the breeder rarely alters only the one his\r\nattention is fixed on; generally quite a number of other characters\r\nalter apart from his intention as an inevitable accompaniment of the\r\ndesired variation on which attention was riveted. There are breeds\r\nof rabbits whose ears hang limply down instead of standing erect,\r\nand in these so-called lop-eared rabbits the ear-muscles are partly\r\ndegenerated, and as a consequence of this lack of muscular strain the\r\nskull has assumed another form. Thus the variation of one part may\r\ninfluence the development of a second and a third organ, and may even\r\nnot stop there, for very often the influence has penetrated much deeper\r\nand affected quite remote parts of the body.\r\n\r\nIf any one were to succeed in adding a heavy pair of horns to a breed\r\nof hornless sheep, there would run parallel with the course of this\r\nvariation, which was directly aimed at, a long series of secondary\r\nchanges which would affect at least the whole of the anterior half of\r\nthe body; the skull would become thicker and stronger to support the\r\nweight of the heavy horns; the neck-tendon (_ligamentum nuchæ_) would\r\nhave to become thicker to hold up the heavy head, and so also with the\r\nmuscles of the neck; the spinous processes of the cervical and dorsal\r\nvertebrae would become longer and stronger, and the forelegs, too,\r\nwould need to adapt themselves to the heavier burden. Every organism\r\nthus resembles, as it were, a mosaic, out of which no individual group\r\nof pieces can be taken and replaced by another without in some measure\r\ndisturbing the correlation and harmony of the whole: in order to\r\nrestore this, the pieces all round about the changed part must be moved\r\nor replaced by others.\r\n\r\nAccording to Darwin, it is to this correlation of parts that we must\r\nrefer the variation of other parts besides the one intentionally\r\naltered in the course of breeding. It must be admitted that the mutual\r\ndependence of the parts plays a very important rôle in the economy\r\nand development of the animal body, as we shall see later, and these\r\nconnexions still remain very mysterious to us. Especially is this\r\nthe case with the connexion between the reproductive organs and the\r\nso-called secondary sexual characters. Removal of the reproductive\r\norgans or gonads induces, in Man, for instance, if it be effected in\r\nyouth, the persistence of the childish voice and the non-development\r\nof the beard; in the stag the antlers do not appear, and in the cock\r\nthe comb does not develop perfectly, &c., but we are not yet able to\r\nunderstand clearly why this should be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE III\r\n\r\nTHE DARWINIAN THEORY (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Natural selection--Variation--Struggle for existence--Geometric ratio\r\n of rate of increase--Normal number and ratio of elimination in a\r\n species--Accidental causes of extinction--Dependence of the strength\r\n of a species on enemies--Struggle for existence between individuals\r\n of the same species--Natural selection affects all organs and\r\n stages--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN artificial selection, through which, with or without conscious\r\nintention, our domesticated animals and cultivated plants have arisen,\r\nthere must obviously be three kinds of co-operative factors: first, the\r\n_variability_ of the species; second, the capacity of the organism for\r\n_transmitting_ its particular characters to its progeny; and third, the\r\n_breeder_ who selects particular qualities for breeding. No one of the\r\nfactors can be dispensed with; the breeder could effect nothing, were\r\nthere not presented to him the variations of parts in the particular\r\ndirection in which he wishes them to vary; an indefinite variation,\r\nthat is, a variation not guided by selection, would never lead to the\r\nformation of new breeds; the species would probably become in time a\r\nmotley mixture of all sorts of variations, but a breed with definite\r\ncharacters, transmissible in their purity to its descendants, could\r\nnever be formed. Finally, every process of selective breeding would be\r\nfutile, if the variations which appeared could not be transmitted.\r\n\r\nDarwin assumes that processes of transformation quite similar to those\r\nwhich take place under the guidance of Man occur also in nature,\r\nand that it is mainly these which have brought about and guided the\r\ntransformations of species which have taken place in the course of the\r\nearth's history. This process he calls _natural selection_.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be admitted that two out of the three factors necessary\r\nto a process of selective breeding are present also in the natural\r\nconditions of the life of species. Variability in some degree or\r\nother is absent from no species of animal or plant, though it may be\r\ngreater in one than in another, and it cannot be doubted that the\r\ninborn differences which distinguish one individual from another are\r\ncapable of transmission. It is only to untrained observers that all the\r\nindividuals of a species appear alike; for instance, all garden whites,\r\nor all the individuals of the small tortoiseshell butterfly (_Vanessa\r\nurticæ_), or all the chaffinches. If the individuals are carefully\r\ncompared it will be recognized that, even in these relatively constant\r\nspecies, no individual exactly resembles another; that even among\r\nbutterflies twenty black scales may go to form a particular spot on\r\nthe wings in one individual and thirty or twenty-five in others; that\r\nthe length of the body, the legs, the antennæ, the proboscis exhibit\r\nminute differences; and it is probable that the same combination of\r\nquite similar parts never occurs twice. In many animals this cannot, of\r\ncourse, be proved, because our power of diagnosis is not fine enough to\r\nbe able to estimate the differences directly, and because a comparison\r\nof measurements of all the parts in detail is not practicable. So we\r\nmay here confine ourselves to the differences in the human race, which\r\nwe can recognize with ease and certainty. Even as regards the face\r\nalone, all men differ from one another, and, numerous and complete as\r\nlikenesses may be, it is impossible to find two human beings in which\r\neven the characters of the face are exactly similar. Even so-called\r\n'identical twins' can always be distinguished if they are directly\r\ncompared either in person or in a photograph, and if the rest of the\r\nbody be also taken into consideration we find numerous small, sometimes\r\neven measurable differences.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of animals, and it is only our lack of practice\r\nthat is at fault if we frequently fail to detect their individual\r\ndifferences. The Bohemian shepherds are said to know personally, and be\r\nable to distinguish from all the rest, every sheep in their herds of\r\nmany thousands. Thus the factors of variability and transmissibility\r\nmust be granted, and it remains only to ask: Who plays the part of\r\nselecting breeder in wild nature? The answer to this question forms\r\nthe kernel to the whole Darwinian theory, which ascribes this rôle to\r\nthe conditions of life, to definite relations of individuals to the\r\nexternal influences which they meet with during the course of their\r\nlives, and which together make up their 'struggle for existence.'\r\n\r\nTo make this idea clear I must to some extent diverge.\r\n\r\nIt is a generally observed fact that, in every species of animals\r\nor of plants, more germs and more individuals are produced than\r\ngrow to maturity, or become capable of reproduction. Numerous young\r\nindividuals perish at an early stage, often because of unfavourable\r\ncircumstances--cold, drought, damp, or through hunger, or at the hands\r\nof their enemies. When we ask which of the progeny perish early, and\r\nwhich survive to carry on the species, we are at first sight inclined\r\nto suppose that this is entirely a matter of chance; but this is just\r\nwhat Darwin disputed. It is not chance alone, it is, above all, the\r\ndifferences between individuals, which enable them to withstand adverse\r\ncircumstances better or worse, and thus decide, according to his view,\r\nwhich shall perish and which shall survive. If this be so, then we\r\nhave a veritable process of selection, and one which secures that the\r\n'best,' that is, the most capable of resistance, survive to breed,\r\nbeing thus, so to speak, 'selected.'\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, however, why so many individuals must perish in youth,\r\nand whether it could not have been arranged that all, or at least most,\r\nshould survive till they had reproduced. But this is an impossibility,\r\nunrealizable for this among other reasons, that organisms multiply in\r\ngeometrical progression, and that their progeny would very soon exceed\r\nthe limits of computability. This does not occur, for there is a limit\r\nset which they can in no case overstep,--which, indeed, as we shall\r\nsee, they never reach--I mean the limits of space and food-supply.\r\nEvery species, by the natural requirements of its life, is restricted\r\nto a particular habitat, to land or to water, but most are still more\r\nstrictly limited to a definite area of the earth's surface, which alone\r\naffords the climate suited to them, or where alone the still more\r\nspecialized conditions of their existence can be realized. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the occurrence of a particular species of plant determines\r\nthat of the animal which is dependent on it for its food-supply. If\r\nthey could multiply unchecked, that is, without the loss of many of\r\ntheir progeny, every species would fill up its area of occurrence and\r\nexhaust the whole of its food-supply, and thus bring about its own\r\nextermination. This seems to be prevented in some way, for as a matter\r\nof fact it does not happen.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be imagined that this might be prevented by a\r\nregulation of the productivity of the species, and that those which\r\nhave not a large area of distribution, or can only count on a\r\nrelatively limited food-supply, have also a low rate of multiplication,\r\nbut this is not the case; even the lowest rate of multiplication would\r\nvery soon suffice to make any species fill up its whole available space\r\nand completely exhaust its food-supply. Darwin takes as an example\r\nthe elephant, which only begins to breed at thirty years of age, and\r\ncontinues to do so till about ninety, but so slowly that in these\r\nsixty years only three pairs of young are produced. Nevertheless, in\r\n500 years an elephant pair would be represented by fifteen millions\r\nof descendants, if all the young survived till they were capable of\r\nreproduction. A species of bird with a duration of life of five years,\r\nduring which it breeds four times, producing and rearing four young\r\neach time, would in the course of fifteen years have 2,000 millions of\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nThus, although the fertility of each species is, as a matter of fact,\r\nprecisely regulated, a low rate of multiplication is not in itself\r\nsufficient to prevent the excessive increase of any species, nor is\r\nthe quantity of the relevant food-supply. Whether this be very large\r\nor very small, we see that in reality it is never entirely used up,\r\nthat, as a matter of fact, a much greater quantity is always left over\r\nthan has been consumed. If increase depended only on food-supply, there\r\nwould, for instance, be food enough in their tropical home for many\r\nthousand times more elephants than actually occur; and among ourselves\r\nthe cockchafers might appear in much greater numbers than they do even\r\nin the worst cockchafer year, for all the leaves of all the trees are\r\nnever eaten up; a great many leaves and a great many trees are left\r\nuntouched even in the years when the voracious insects are the most\r\nnumerous. Nor do the rose-aphides, notwithstanding their enormously\r\nrapid multiplication, ever destroy all the young shoots of a rose-bush,\r\nor all the rose-bushes of a garden, or of the whole area in which roses\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be noted, that the number of individuals in\r\na species undoubtedly does bear some relation to the amount of the\r\nfood-supply available; for instance, it is very low among the large\r\ncarnivores, the lion, the eagle, and the like. In our Alps the eagles\r\nhave become rarer with the decrease of game, and where one eagle pair\r\nmake their eyrie they rule alone over a hunting territory of more than\r\nsixty miles, a preserve on which no others of the same species are\r\nallowed to intrude. If there were several pairs of eagles in such a\r\npreserve, they would soon have so decimated the food-supply that they\r\nwould starve. On the other hand, numerous herbivores, e.g. chamois and\r\nmarmots, live within the bounds of the pair of eagles' hunting grounds,\r\nsince the food they require is present in enormously greater quantity.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the number of individuals of a given species\r\nwhich live in a particular area is not exactly the same year in year\r\nout, being subject to small, and sometimes, as in the case of the\r\naphides and cockchafers, to very great fluctuations, nevertheless we\r\nmay assume that the _average number_ remains the same, that in the\r\ncourse of a century, or, let us say, of a thousand years, the number\r\nof mature individuals inhabiting the particular area remains the\r\nsame. This, of course, only holds true on the supposition that there\r\nhas been no great change in the external conditions of life during\r\nthis period. But before Man began to interfere with nature, these\r\nexternal conditions would remain uniform for much longer periods\r\nthan we have assumed. Let us call the average number of individuals\r\noccurring on such a uniform area, _the normal number_ of the species;\r\nthis number will be determined in the first instance by the number of\r\noffspring that are annually brought forth, and secondly by the number\r\nthat annually perish before reaching maturity. As the fertility of\r\na species is a definite quantity, so also will its elimination be\r\ndefinite, or, as we may say, when the normal number under uniform\r\nconditions of life remains constant, the ratio of elimination will\r\nalso remain constant. Each species is therefore subject to a perfectly\r\ndefinite ratio of elimination which remains on the average constant,\r\nand this is the reason why a species does not multiply beyond its\r\nnormal number notwithstanding the great excess of the food-supply, and\r\nnotwithstanding the fertility which, in all species, is sufficient to\r\nlead to boundless multiplication.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to calculate the ratio of elimination for a\r\nparticular species, if one knows its rate of multiplication; for if\r\nthe normal number remains constant, it follows that only two of all\r\nthe offspring which a pair brings forth in the course of its life can\r\nattain to reproductive maturity, and that all the rest must perish.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, a pair of storks produced four young ones\r\nannually for twenty years, of these eighty young ones which are born\r\nwithin this period, on an average seventy-eight must perish, and only\r\ntwo can become mature animals. If more than two attained maturity\r\nthe total number of storks would increase, and this is against the\r\npresupposition of constancy in the normal number. It is important, in\r\nreference to the fact on which we are now focusing our attention, that\r\nwe should consider some other illustrations from the same point of\r\nview. The female trout yearly produces about 600 eggs; let us assume\r\nthat it remains capable of reproduction for only ten years, then the\r\nelimination-number of the species will be 6,000 less two, that is,\r\n5,998, for of the 6,000 eggs only two can become mature animals. But\r\nin the majority of fishes the ratio of extermination is enormously\r\ngreater than this. Thus a female herring brings forth 40,000 eggs\r\nannually, the duration of life is estimated at ten years, and this\r\nmeans an elimination number of 400,000 less two, that is, 399,998. The\r\ncarp produces 200,000 eggs a year, and the sturgeon two millions, and\r\nboth species live long, and remain capable of reproduction for at least\r\nfifty years. But of all the 100 million eggs which are produced by the\r\nsturgeon, only two reach their full development and reproduce; all\r\nothers perish prematurely.\r\n\r\nBut even with these examples we have not reached the highest\r\nelimination number, for many of the lower animals--not to speak of\r\nmany plants--produce an even greater number of offspring. Leuwenhoek\r\ncalculated the fertility of a thread-worm at sixty million eggs, and a\r\ntape-worm produces hardly less than 100 millions.\r\n\r\nThere exists, therefore, a constant relation between fertility and the\r\nratio of elimination; the higher the latter is, the greater must the\r\nformer be, if the species is to survive at all. The example of the\r\ntape-worm makes this very obvious, for here we can readily understand\r\nwhy the fertility must be so enormous, as we are aware of the long\r\nchain of chances on which the successful development of this animal\r\ndepends. The common tape-worm of Man, _Tænia solium_, does not lay\r\nits eggs, they remain enclosed within one of the liberated joints or\r\n'proglottides.' Only if this liberated joint or one of the embryos\r\nwithin it happens to be fortuitously eaten by a pig or other mammal can\r\nthere be successful development, and even then under difficulties and\r\npossible failures, and not right away into adult animals, but first\r\ninto microscopically minute larvæ which may bore their way into the\r\nwalls of the intestine, or, if they are fortunate enough, may get into\r\nthe blood-stream and be carried by it to a remote part of the body.\r\nThere they develop into 'measles,' the so-called bladder-worms, within\r\nwhich the head of the tape-worm arises. But in order that this may\r\nbecome a complete and reproductive adult worm the pig must die, and the\r\nnext step necessary is that a piece of the flesh of the infected first\r\nhost must happen to be swallowed raw by a man or other mammal! Only\r\nthen does the fortunate bladder-worm--swallowed with the flesh--attain\r\nthe goal of its life, that is, a suitable place to mature in, the\r\nfood-canal of a human being. It is obvious that countless eggs must\r\nbe lost for one that succeeds in getting through the whole course of\r\na development depending so greatly on chance. Hence the necessity for\r\nsuch enormous productivity of eggs.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the causes of elimination, which keep a species within\r\ndue bounds, are very difficult to determine. Enemies, that is to say,\r\nother species which use the species in question as food, play an\r\nimportant rôle; often, however, the cause lies in the unfavourableness\r\nof external conditions, in chance, which is favourable only to one\r\nof a thousand. The oak would only require to produce one seed in\r\nthe 500 years of its life, if it were certain that that one would\r\ngrow into an oak-tree; but most of the little acorns are eaten up by\r\npigs, squirrels, insects, &c., before they have had time to sprout,\r\nthousands fall on ground already thickly covered with growth where\r\nthey cannot take root, and even if they do succeed in finding an\r\nunoccupied space in which to germinate, the young plants are still\r\nsurrounded by a thousand dangers--the possibility of being devoured by\r\nmany animals large and small, of being suffocated by the surrounding\r\nvegetation, and so on. We can thus understand, to some extent, though\r\nonly approximately, why it is that the oak must year by year produce\r\nthousands of seeds in order that the species may maintain its normal\r\nnumber, and not be exterminated; for it is obvious that a constant,\r\neven though slow diminution of the normal number, a regular deficit, so\r\nto speak, can end in nothing else than the gradual extinction of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nBut even this prodigality of seeds is not the greatest reach of\r\nfertility that we meet with in nature; it is, perhaps, amongst the\r\nsimpler flowerless plants that we find the climax. It has been\r\ncalculated that a single frond of the beautiful fern so common in our\r\nwoods, _Aspidium filix mas_, produces about fourteen million spores.\r\nThey serve to distribute the species, and are carried as motes by the\r\nwind, but comparatively few of the millions ever get the length of\r\ngerminating at all, much less of attaining to full development into\r\nadult plants. Thus we see that the apparent prodigality of nature is a\r\nreal necessity, an indispensable condition of the maintenance of the\r\nspecies; the fertility of each species is related to the actualities of\r\nelimination to which it is exposed. This is clearly seen when a species\r\nis placed under new and more favourable conditions of life, in which\r\nit has an abundant food-supply and few enemies. This was the case, for\r\ninstance, with the horses introduced from Europe into South America,\r\nwhere they reverted to a feral state, and are now represented by\r\nherds of many thousands roaming the great grassy plains. If the small\r\nsinging-birds of a region diminish in number, there is a great increase\r\nof caterpillars and other injurious insects which form part of their\r\nfood-supply. The colossal destruction which the much-dreaded nun-moth\r\nfrom time to time brings about in our woods probably depends in part\r\non the diminution of one or another of the many animals inimical to\r\ninsects; but the occurrence of several years of weather-conditions\r\nfavourable to the larvæ must also be taken into account. How\r\nenormously, indeed almost inconceivably, the number of larvæ may\r\nincrease under favourable conditions is shown by such devastations\r\nas that in Prussia in 1856, when many square miles of forest were\r\nabsolutely eaten up. The caterpillars were so numerous that even from\r\nsome distance the falling excrement could be heard rustling like rain,\r\nand ten hundredweights of the eggs were collected, with an average of\r\n20,000 eggs to the half-ounce!\r\n\r\nBut it would be a great mistake to conclude, from this enormous and\r\nsudden increase in the number of individuals, that the normal number\r\nof individuals is determined by the number of enemies alone. The\r\naverage number of individuals in a species depends on many other\r\nconditions, especially on the extent of the available area, and on\r\nthe amount of the food-supply in relation to the size of body in the\r\nspecies. I cannot dwell on this now, but I wish to point out that,\r\nfor the continuance of a species, it is indifferent whether it is\r\n'frequent' or 'rare,' if we presuppose that its normal number remains\r\non an average constant for centuries, that is, that its fertility\r\nsuffices to make good the continual losses through enemies and other\r\ncauses of elimination. One would be inclined to conclude from such\r\ncases of sudden and enormous increase in the number of individuals as\r\nthese caterpillar-blights, that enemies and other causes of destruction\r\nplayed the major part in the regulation of the normal number of the\r\nspecies. But this is only apparently the case. Enemies necessitate\r\na certain fertility in the species on which they prey, so that the\r\nelimination in each generation may be made good; but the number of\r\npairs capable of reproduction is not thereby decisively determined.\r\nWe must not forget that the number of enemies is also, on the other\r\nhand, dependent on the number of victims, and that the normal number of\r\nenemies must rise and fall with that of the species preyed upon.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, such an enormous increase as that of the caterpillars\r\ncannot last long; it carries its corrective in itself. The appearance\r\nof the caterpillars in such enormous numbers in itself increases the\r\nhost of their enemies; singing-birds, ichneumon-flies, beetle-grubs,\r\nand predaceous beetles find abundant and available food, and therefore\r\nreproduce and multiply so rapidly, that, with the help of the\r\ncaterpillar's plant-enemies, especially the insect-destroying fungi,\r\nthey soon reduce the caterpillars to their normal number, or even\r\nbelow it. But then the reverse process begins; the enemies of the\r\ncaterpillars diminish because their food has become scarce, and their\r\nnormal number is lowered, while that of the caterpillars gradually\r\nrises again.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of foxes in a hunting district increases, the number of\r\nthe hares that they prey upon diminishes, and, on the other hand, the\r\ndecimating of the foxes by Man brings about an increase in the number\r\nof hares in the district. Under natural conditions, that is, without\r\nthe intervention of Man, there would be a constant balancing of the\r\nnumbers of hares and foxes, for every noteworthy increase of the hares\r\nwould be followed by a similar increase of foxes, and this, in its\r\nturn, would diminish the number of hares, so that they would no longer\r\nsuffice for the support of so many foxes, and these would decrease in\r\nnumber again, until the number of hares had again increased because\r\nof the lessened persecution and elimination. In nature the case is not\r\nquite so simple, because the fox does not live on hares alone, and the\r\nhare is not preyed upon only by the fox; but the illustration may serve\r\nto elucidate the point that a moving equilibrium is maintained between\r\nthe species of a district, between persecutors and persecuted, in such\r\na way that the number of individuals in the two species is always\r\nvarying a little up and down, and that each influences the other so\r\nthat a regulative process results. Throughout periods of considerable\r\nlength the average remains the same; that is to say, a _normal number_\r\nis established. This normal strength of population is the mean above\r\nand below which the number of individuals is constantly varying. It is,\r\nof course, seldom that the mutual influences and regulations are so\r\nsimple as in the example given; usually several or even many species\r\ninteract upon each other, and not beasts of prey and their victims\r\nalone, but the most diverse species of animals and plants, which do\r\nnot stand in any obvious relation to one another at all. Moreover, the\r\nphysical, and especially the climatic conditions, also cause the normal\r\nnumber of the species to rise and fall.\r\n\r\nThe inter-relations between species living together on the same area\r\nare so intricate that I should like to give two other illustrations.\r\nLet us first take Darwin's famous instance of the fertility of clover,\r\nwhich depends on the number of cats. It is of course only an imaginary\r\none, but the facts it is based upon are quite correct. The number of\r\ncats living in a village to a certain extent determines the number of\r\nfield-mice in the neighbourhood. These again destroy the nests of the\r\nhumble-bees, which live in holes in the ground, and thus the number\r\nof humble-bees depends on that of the field-mice and cats. But the\r\nclover must be pollinated by insects if it is to produce fertile seed,\r\nand only the humble-bee has a proboscis long enough to effect the\r\npollination. Therefore the quantity of clover-seed annually produced\r\ndepends on the number of humble-bees, and ultimately upon the number of\r\ncats. And, as a matter of fact, humble-bees were introduced into New\r\nZealand from England, because without them the clover would produce no\r\nfertile seeds.\r\n\r\nOn the grassy plains of Paraguay there are no wild cattle and horses,\r\nbecause of the presence of a fly which has a predilection for laying\r\nits eggs in the navel of the newly-born calves and foals, with the\r\nresult that the calves or foals are killed by the emerging maggots. We\r\nmay reasonably assume that the numerical strength of this fly-species\r\ndepends on the distribution of insect-eating birds, whose numbers\r\nin turn are determined by certain beasts of prey. These again vary\r\nin number in relation to the extent of the forest-land, and this is\r\ndetermined by the number of ruminants which browse on the young growth\r\nof the woods (Darwin).\r\n\r\nThat forests can actually be totally destroyed by ruminants is proved\r\nby the case of the island of St. Helena among others. On its discovery\r\nthe island was covered with thick wood, but in the course of 200 years\r\nit was transformed into a bare rock by goats and pigs, which devoured\r\nthe young growth so completely that trees which were felled or which\r\ndied were not replaced.\r\n\r\nThis point is vividly illustrated by Darwin's observation of a\r\nwide heath on which stood only a few groups of old pine-trees. The\r\nmere fencing in of a portion of the heath sufficed to call forth a\r\nthick growth of young seedling pines within the enclosure, and an\r\nexamination of the open part of the heath revealed that the grazing\r\ncattle had eaten up all the young pine-trees which sprang from seed,\r\nand that again and again. In one small space thirty-two little trees\r\nstood concealed in the grass, and several of these showed as many as\r\ntwenty-six yearly rings.\r\n\r\nHow definitely the number of individuals in different species living on\r\nthe same area mutually limit and thereby regulate each other, Darwin\r\nsought to illustrate also by the case of the primitive forest, where\r\nthe numerous species of plants occur, not mixed together irregularly,\r\nbut in a definite proportion. We can find examples of the same kind\r\nwherever the plant-growth of a district has been left to itself. If we\r\nwalk along the banks of our little river, the Dreisam, we see a wild\r\nconfusion of the most diverse trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. But,\r\neven though it cannot be demonstrated, we may be certain that these are\r\nrepresented in definite numerical proportions, dependent on the natural\r\nqualities and requirements of each species, on the number of their\r\nseeds and the facilities for their distribution, on the favourable\r\nor unfavourable season at which they ripen, and on their varying\r\ncapacity for taking root in the worst ground, and springing quickly\r\nup, &c. They limit each other mutually, so that the whole flora of the\r\nriver-bank will be made up of one per cent. of this species, one per\r\ncent. of that, and, it may be, five per cent. of a third, and the same\r\ncombination will repeat itself in the same proportions on the banks of\r\nother rivers of our country in as far as the external conditions are\r\nthe same. The same must be true of the fauna of such a plant-thicket;\r\nthe animal species also limit one another mutually, and thereby\r\nregulate the number of individuals, which becomes relatively stable\r\nover any area on which the conditions remain the same. That is to say,\r\na 'normal number' is attained and persists.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the capacity for boundless multiplication inherent in\r\nevery species is limited by the co-existence of other species; there\r\nis, metaphorically speaking, a continuous struggle going on between\r\nspecies, plant and animal alike; each seeks as far as possible to\r\nmultiply, and each is hemmed in by the others and as far as possible\r\nprevented from doing so. The 'struggle' is by no means only the\r\n_direct_ limitation of the number of individuals, which consists in\r\nthe use of one species by another as food, as in beasts of prey and\r\ntheir victims, or locusts and plants; it is much more the indirect\r\nlimitation--figuratively speaking, the struggle for space, for light,\r\nfor moisture among plants, for food among animals. But all this,\r\nimportant as it is, does not yet exhaust the content of that 'struggle\r\nfor existence' to which Darwin and Wallace ascribe the rôle of the\r\nbreeder in the process of natural selection. The struggle, that is,\r\nthe mutual limiting of species, may indeed restrict a species in\r\nits distribution, and may reduce its normal number possibly to nil.\r\nIn other words, it may bring about extinction, but it cannot make\r\na species other than it is. This can only be done by a struggle\r\nwithin the limits of the species itself, and this struggle is due\r\nto the fact that of the numerous offspring, on an average those\r\nsurvive--that is, attain to reproduction--which are the most fit,\r\nwhose constitution makes it most possible for them to overcome the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of life, and so to reach maturity. We see,\r\nin fact, that a large percentage of each generation in all species\r\nalways perishes before attaining maturity. If, then, the decision as to\r\nwhich is to perish and which is to reach maturity is _not a matter of\r\nchance alone_, but is in part due to the constitution of the growing\r\nindividual; if the 'fittest' do _on the average_ survive, and the\r\n'least fit' are on the average eliminated, we have here a process of\r\nselection entirely comparable to that of artificial selection, and\r\none whose result must be the 'improvement' of the species, whether\r\nthat depends on one set of characters or on another. The victorious\r\nqualities, which earlier were peculiar to certain individuals, must\r\ngradually become the common property of the species, if in each\r\ngeneration the individuals which attained to reproduction all possessed\r\nthem, and thus could transmit them to their progeny. But those of the\r\ndescendants which did not inherit them would again be at a disadvantage\r\nin the struggle for existence, or rather for reaching maturity, if in\r\neach generation a higher percentage of individuals which possess these\r\ncharacters reach maturity than of those which do not possess them. This\r\npercentage must increase in each generation, because, in each, natural\r\nselection again chooses out the fittest, and it must finally rise to\r\n100 per cent., that is to say, none but individuals of this fittest\r\ntype will be left surviving.\r\n\r\nThis does not yet exhaust the process, however, for we can infer\r\nfrom the results of artificial breed-forming that the selected\r\ncharacters may intensify from generation to generation, and that\r\nthey will continue to do so as long as it gives them any advantage\r\nin the struggle for existence, for so long will it lead to the more\r\nfrequent survival of its possessors. The increase will only stop when\r\nit has reached the highest degree of usefulness, and in this way new\r\ncharacters may be formed, just as, in artificial selection, the short\r\nupward-turning feathers of the Jacobin pigeon have been intensified\r\ninto the peruke, a feather canopy covering the head.\r\n\r\nA few examples of natural selection will make the process clearer. Our\r\nhare is well secured from discovery by his fur of mixed brown, yellow,\r\nwhite, and black, when he cowers in his form among the dry leaves of\r\nthe underwood. It is easy to pass close to him without seeing him.\r\nBut if the ground and the bushes are covered with snow, he contrasts\r\nconspicuously with them. Suppose, now, that our climate became colder,\r\nand that the winter brought lasting snow, the hares which had the\r\nlargest mixture of white in their fur would have an advantage in their\r\n'struggle for existence' over their darker fellows; they would be less\r\neasily discovered by their enemies--the fox, the badger, the horned\r\nowl, and the wild cat. Of the numerous hares which would annually\r\nbecome the prey of these enemies, there would be, on an average, more\r\ndark than light individuals. The percentage of light-coloured hares\r\nwould, therefore, increase from generation to generation, and the\r\nlonger the winter the keener would be the selection between dark and\r\nlight hares, until finally none but light ones would remain. At the\r\nsame time, the colour of the hares would become increasingly light,\r\nfirst, because it would happen more and more frequently that two light\r\nhares would pair, and secondly, because, after a time, the struggle for\r\nexistence would no longer be between light and dark hares, but between\r\nlight hares and still lighter ones. Thus ultimately a race of white\r\nhares would arise, as has actually happened in the Arctic regions and\r\non the Alps.\r\n\r\nOr let us think of a herbaceous plant, in appearance something like a\r\nbelladonna, rich in leaves and very juicy, but not poisonous. It would\r\ndoubtless be a favourite food with the animals of the forest, and it\r\nwould not, therefore, attain to more than a sparse occurrence, since\r\nfew of the individuals would be able to form seeds. But now let us\r\nassume that a stuff of very unpleasant taste develops in the stem and\r\nleaves of some of the individuals, as may easily happen through very\r\nslight changes in the chemical metabolism of the plant, what, then,\r\ncould result but that such individuals would be less readily eaten than\r\nthe others? A process of selection must, therefore, ensue, and the\r\nunpleasant-tasting specimens of the plant would be much more frequently\r\nspared, and consequently would bear seed much oftener than the\r\npalatable ones. Thus the number of unpalatable plants would increase\r\nfrom year to year. If the stuff in question were not only unpalatable\r\nbut poisonous, or gradually became so, a plant would in time be evolved\r\nwhich would be absolutely safe from being devoured by animals, just as\r\nthe deadly nightshade (_Atropa belladonna_) actually is.\r\n\r\nOr let us suppose that a stretch of water is inhabited by a species of\r\ncarp, which have hitherto had no large enemy, and so have become lazy\r\nand slow, and that there migrates from the sea into this stretch of\r\nwater a large species of pike. At first numerous carp will fall victims\r\nto the pike, and the pike will rapidly increase in number. But if all\r\nthe carp were not equally lazy and dull-witted, if some of them were\r\nquicker and more intelligent, these would, on an average, become more\r\nrarely the victims of the pike, and numerous individuals with these\r\nbetter qualities would survive in each generation, till ultimately\r\nthere were no others, and the useful characters would gradually become\r\nintensified, and so a more active and wary race of carp would arise.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, however, that the increased activity and wariness would\r\nnot alone suffice to preserve the colony from extinction; it might\r\nrequire also an increased fertility to prevent the normal number from\r\nbeing permanently lowered; but even this could eventually be brought\r\nabout by natural selection, if the nature of the species and the\r\ngeneral conditions of its life permitted. For there are variations of\r\nfertility in every species, and if the chance of seeing some of its\r\neggs become mature animals were greater for the more fertile female\r\nthan for the less fertile, _ceteris paribus_, a process of selection\r\nmust take place, which would result in an increase of fertility as far\r\nas that was possible.\r\n\r\nObviously, such processes of natural selection can affect all parts\r\nand characters--size and form of the body, as well as isolated parts,\r\nthe external skin and its colour, every internal organ--and not bodily\r\ncharacters alone, but psychical ones as well, such as intelligence and\r\ninstincts. According to this principle, it is only characters which\r\nare biologically indifferent that cannot be altered through natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nNatural selection can also bring about changes at every age, for the\r\nelimination of individuals begins from the egg, and any kind of egg\r\nwhich is in some way better able to escape elimination will transmit\r\nits useful characters to its descendants, because the resulting young\r\nanimals will thus more frequently reach full development than the\r\nyoung from other eggs. In the same way, at every succeeding stage of\r\ndevelopment, every character favourable to the preservation of the\r\nindividual will be maintained and intensified.\r\n\r\nWe see from all this that natural selection is vastly more powerful\r\nthan artificial selection by Man. In the latter, only one character at\r\na time can be caused to change, while natural selection may influence a\r\nwhole group of characters at the same time, as well as all the stages\r\nof development. Through the weeding out of the individuals which are\r\nannually exterminated, it is always on an average the 'fittest' which\r\nsurvive, that is to say, those which have the greatest number of\r\nbodily parts and rudiments of parts in the fittest possible condition\r\nof development at every stage. The longer this process of selection\r\ncontinues, the smaller will be the deviations of the individual from\r\nthis standard, and the more minute will be the differences of fitness\r\ndetermining which is to be eliminated and which is to survive to\r\nreproduce its characteristics. In the immeasurable periods of time\r\nwhich are at the disposal of natural selection, and in the inestimable\r\nnumbers of individuals on which it may operate, lie the essential\r\ncauses of superiority of natural selection over the artificial\r\nselection of Man.\r\n\r\nTo sum up briefly: Natural selection depends essentially on the\r\ncumulative augmentation of the most minute useful variations in the\r\ndirection of their utility; only the useful is developed and increased,\r\nand great effects are brought about slowly through the summing up of\r\nmany very minute steps. Natural selection is a self-regulation of the\r\nspecies which secures its preservation; its result is the ceaseless\r\nadaptation of the species to its life-conditions. As soon as these\r\nvary, natural selection changes its mode of action, for what was\r\npreviously the best is now no longer so; parts that before had to be\r\nlarge must now perhaps be small, or vice versa; muscle-groups which\r\nwere weak must now become strong, and so on. The conditions of life\r\nare, so to speak, the mould into which natural selection is continually\r\npouring the species anew.\r\n\r\nBut the philosophical significance of natural selection lies in\r\nthe fact, that it shows us how to explain the origin of useful,\r\nwell-adapted structures purely by mechanical forces and without\r\nhaving to fall back on a _directive_ force. We are thus for the first\r\ntime in a position to understand, in some degree, the marvellous\r\nadaptation of the organism to an end, without having to call to our\r\naid any supernaturally intrusive force on the part of the Creator. We\r\nunderstand now how, in a purely mechanical way, through the forces\r\nalways at work in nature, all forms of life must conform to, and adapt\r\nthemselves precisely to the conditions of their life, since only the\r\nbest possible is preserved, and everything less good is continually\r\nbeing rejected.\r\n\r\nBefore I go on to expound in detail the phenomena which we refer to\r\nnatural selection, I must briefly state that Darwin did not ascribe to\r\nnatural selection by any means all the changes which have taken place\r\nin organisms in the course of time. On the one hand, he ascribed a not\r\ninconsiderable importance to the correlated variations we have already\r\nmentioned; still more, however, he relied on the direct influence of\r\naltered conditions of life, whether these consist in climatic and other\r\nchanges in the environment, or in the assumption of new habits, and\r\nthe increased or diminished use of individual parts and organs thereby\r\ninduced. He recognized the principle so strongly emphasized by Lamarck,\r\nof use and disuse as a cause of heritable increase or decrease of the\r\nexercised or neglected part, though he did so with a certain reserve.\r\nI shall return later to these factors of modification, and shall then\r\nattempt to show that these too are to be referred to processes of\r\nselection, which are, however, of a different order from the phenomena\r\nwhich the Darwin-Wallace principle of natural selection serves to\r\ninterpret. But, in the first instance, it appears to me to be necessary\r\nto show how far the Darwin-Wallace interpretation will suffice, and\r\nin the next lectures we shall occupy ourselves with this question\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE IV\r\n\r\nTHE COLORATION OF ANIMALS AND ITS RELATION TO THE PROCESSES OF SELECTION\r\n\r\n Biological significance of colours--Protective colours of\r\n eggs--Animals of the snow-region--Animals of the desert--Transparent\r\n animals--Green animals--Nocturnal animals--Double\r\n colour-adaptation--Protective marking of caterpillars--Warning\r\n markings--Dimorphism of colouring in caterpillars--Shunting back\r\n of colouring in ontogeny--'Sympathetic' colouring in diurnal\r\n Lepidoptera--In nocturnal Lepidoptera--Theoretical considerations--The\r\n influence of illumination in the production of protective colouring,\r\n _Tropidoderus_--Harmony of protective colouring in minute\r\n details--_Notodonta_--Objections--Imitation of Strange objects,\r\n _Xylina_--Leaf-butterflies, _Kallima_--_Hebomoja_--Nocturnal\r\n Lepidoptera with leaf-markings--Orthoptera resembling\r\n leaves--Caterpillars of the Geometridæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen what Darwin meant by natural selection, and we understand\r\nthat this process really implies a transformation of organisms by\r\nslow degrees, in the direction of adaptive fitness--a transformation\r\nwhich must ensue as necessarily as when a human selector, prompted\r\nby conscious intention, tries to improve an animal in a particular\r\ndirection, by always selecting the 'fittest' animals for breeding.\r\nIn nature, too, there is selection, because in every generation\r\nthe majority succumb in the struggle for life, while on an average\r\nthose which survive, attain to reproductive maturity, and transmit\r\ntheir characters to their descendants, are those which are best\r\nadapted to the conditions of their life--that is, which possess those\r\nvariations of most advantage in overcoming the dangers of life.\r\nSince individuals are always variable in some degree, since their\r\nvariations can be inherited by their progeny, and since the continually\r\nrepeated elimination of the majority of those descendants is a fact,\r\nthe inference from these premisses must be correct; there must be a\r\n'natural selection' in the direction of a gradually increasing fitness\r\nand effectiveness of the forms of life.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, directly observe this process of natural selection;\r\nit goes on too slowly, and our powers of observation are neither\r\ncomprehensive nor fine enough. How could we set about investigating\r\nthe millions of individuals which constitute the numerical strength\r\nof a species on a given area, to find out whether they possess\r\nsome variable character in a definite percentage, and whether this\r\npercentage increases in the course of decades or centuries? And\r\nthere is, furthermore, the difficulty of estimating the biological\r\nimportance of any variation that may occur. Even in cases where we know\r\nits significance quite well in a general way, we cannot estimate its\r\nrelative value in reference to the variation of some other character,\r\nthough that other may also be quite intelligible. Later on, we shall\r\nspeak of protective colouring, and in so doing we shall discuss the\r\ncaterpillars of one of the Sphingidæ, which occur in two protective\r\ncolours, some being brown, others green. From the greater frequency of\r\nthe brown form we may conclude that brown is here a better adaptation\r\nthan green, but how could we infer this from the character itself,\r\nor from our merely approximate knowledge of the mode of life of the\r\nspecies, its habits, and the dangers which threaten it? A direct\r\nestimation of the relative protective value of the two colours is\r\naltogether out of the question. The survival of the fittest cannot be\r\nproved in nature, simply because we are not in a position to decide,\r\n_a priori_, what the fittest is. For this reason I was forced to try\r\nto make the process of natural selection clear by means of imagined\r\nexamples, rather than observed ones.\r\n\r\nBut though we cannot directly follow the uninterrupted process of\r\nnatural selection which is going on under natural conditions, there is\r\nanother kind of proof for this hypothesis, besides that which consists\r\nin logically deducing a process from correct premisses; I should like\r\nto call this the practical proof. If a hypothesis can be made to\r\nexplain a great number of otherwise unintelligible facts, it thereby\r\ngains a high degree of probability, and this is increased when there\r\nare no facts to be found which are in contradiction to it.\r\n\r\nBoth of these criteria are fulfilled by the selection-hypothesis, and\r\nindeed the phenomena which may be explained by it, and are intelligible\r\nin no other way, present themselves to us in such enormous numbers,\r\nthat there can be no doubt whatever as to the correctness of the\r\nprinciple; all that can be still disputed is, how far it reaches.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to this practical way of proving the\r\ntheory by the facts which it serves to interpret, beginning with a\r\nconsideration of the external appearance of organisms, their colour and\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Colour and Form of Organisms._\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin had in many cases already rightly recognized the\r\nbiological significance of the colouring of an animal species, and\r\nwe may be sure that many of the numerous good observers of earlier\r\ntimes had similar ideas. I can even state definitely that Rösel von\r\nRosenhof, the famous miniature-painter and naturalist of Nürnberg in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, recognized clearly, and gave\r\nbeautiful descriptions of what we now call colour-adaptation. It is\r\ntrue that he gave them only as isolated instances, and was far from\r\nrecognizing the phenomenon of colour-adaptation in general, or even\r\nfrom inquiring into its causes. From the time of Linné, the endeavour\r\nto establish new species overshadowed all the finer observation of\r\nlife-habits and inter-relations, and, later on, after Blumenbach,\r\nKielmeyer, Cuvier, and others, the eager investigation of the internal\r\nstructure of animals also tended to divert attention from these\r\nœcological relations. In systematic zoology, colour ranked only as a\r\ndiagnostic character of subordinate value, because it is often not very\r\nstable, and indeed is sometimes very variable; it was therefore found\r\npreferable to keep to such relatively stable differences as are to be\r\nfound in the form, size, and number of parts.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was the first to redirect attention to the fact that the\r\ncolouring of animals is anything but an unimportant matter; that, on\r\nthe contrary, in many cases it is of use to the animal, e.g. in making\r\nit inconspicuous; a green insect is not readily seen on green leaves,\r\nnor a grey-brown one on the bark of a tree.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the origin of such a so-called 'sympathetic'\r\ncoloration, harmonizing with the usual environment of the animal, can\r\nbe easily interpreted in terms of the principle of selection; and it is\r\nequally evident that it cannot be explained by the Lamarckian principle\r\nof transformation. Through the accumulation of slight useful variations\r\nin colour, it is quite possible for a green or a brown insect to arise\r\nfrom a previous colour, but a grey or a brown insect could not possibly\r\nhave become a green one simply by getting into the habit of sitting on\r\na green leaf; and still less can the will of the animal or any kind\r\nof activity have brought the change about. Even if the animal had any\r\nidea that it would be very useful to it to be coloured green, now that\r\nit had got into the habit of sitting on a leaf, it could not have done\r\nanything towards attaining the desirable green colour. Quite recently\r\nthe possibility of a kind of colour-photography on the skin of the\r\nanimal has been suggested, but there are many species whose colouring\r\nis in contrast to their environment, so that the skin in these cases\r\ndoes not act as a photographic plate, and it would, therefore, have\r\nto be explained how it comes to pass that it functions as such in\r\nthe sympathetically coloured animals. I do not ask for proof of the\r\nchemical composition of the stuff which is supposed to be sensitive to\r\nlight. Whether this be iodide of silver or something quite different,\r\nthe question remains the same: how comes it that it has only appeared\r\nin animals to which a sympathetic colouring is advantageous in the\r\nstruggle for life? And the answer, from our point of view, must read:\r\nit has arisen through natural selection in those species to which a\r\nsympathetic colouring is useful. Thus even if the supposition that\r\nsympathetic colouring is due to automatic photography on the part of\r\nthe skin were correct, we should still have to regard it as an outcome\r\nof natural selection; but it is not correct--at least in general--as\r\nthe above objection shows, and as will be further apparent from many of\r\nthe phenomena of colour-adaptation which I shall now adduce.\r\n\r\nTo explain sympathetic coloration, then, we must assume, with Darwin\r\nand Wallace, a process of selection due to the fact that, as changes\r\ntook place in the course of time in the colouring of the surroundings,\r\nthose individuals on an average most easily escaped the persecution of\r\ntheir enemies which diverged least in colour from their surroundings,\r\nand so, in the course of generations, an ever greater harmony with this\r\ncolouring was established. Variations in colouring crop up everywhere,\r\nand as soon as these reached such a degree as to afford their\r\npossessors a more effective protection than the colouring of their\r\nfellows, then natural selection of necessity stepped in, and would only\r\ncease to act when the harmony with the environment had become complete,\r\nor, at least, so nearly so that any increase of it could not heighten\r\nthe deception.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is presupposed in the working out this selective process\r\nthat the species has enemies which see. This is the case, however, with\r\nmost animals living on the earth or in the water, unless they are of\r\nmicroscopic minuteness. Many animals, too, are subject to persecution\r\nnot only in their adult state, but at almost every period of their\r\nlife, and so, in general, we should expect that many of them would have\r\nattained at each stage that coloration of body that would render them\r\nleast liable to discovery by their enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd this is in reality the case: numerous animals are protected in some\r\nmeasure by so-called sympathetic colouring, from the egg to the adult\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the egg, and of course there is no need to speak of\r\nany eggs except those which are laid. Of these many are simply white\r\nin colour, e.g. the eggs of many birds, snakes, and lizards, and this\r\nseems to contradict our prediction; but these eggs are either hidden in\r\nearth, compost, or sand, as in the case of the reptiles, or they are\r\nlaid in dome-shaped nests, or concealed in holes in trees, as in many\r\nbirds; thus they require no protective colouring.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however, numerous eggs, especially of insects and\r\nbirds, possess a colouring which makes it very difficult to distinguish\r\nthem from their usual surroundings. Our large green grasshopper\r\n(_Locusta viridissima_) lays its eggs in the earth, and they are\r\nbrown, exactly like the earth which surrounds them. They are enough\r\nin themselves to refute the hypothesis that sympathetic colouring has\r\narisen through self-photography, for these eggs lie in total darkness\r\nin the ground. Insect-eggs which are laid on the bark of trees are\r\noften grey-brown or whitish like it, and the eggs of the humming-bird\r\nhawk-moth (_Macroglossa stellatarum_), which are attached singly to the\r\nleaves of the bedstraw, have the same beautiful light-green colour as\r\nthese leaves, and, in point of fact, green is a predominant colour of\r\nthe eggs in a very large number of insects.\r\n\r\nBut the eggs of many birds, too, exhibit 'sympathetic' colouring; thus\r\nthe curlew (_Numenius arquata_) has green eggs, which are laid in the\r\ngrass; but the red grouse (_Lagopus scoticus_) lays blackish-brown\r\neggs, exactly of the colour of the surrounding moor-soil; and it has\r\nbeen observed that they remain uncovered for twelve days, for the\r\nhen lays only one egg daily, and does not begin to brood until the\r\nwhole number of twelve is complete. Herein lies the reason of the\r\ncolour-adaptation, which the eggs would not have required, if they had\r\nalways been covered by the brooding bird.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of birds are frequently not of one colour only; those of the\r\nAlpine ptarmigan (_Lagopus alpinus_), for instance, are ochre-yellow\r\nwith brown and red-brown dots, resembling the nest, which is carelessly\r\nconstructed of dry parts of plants. Sometimes this mingling of colours\r\nreaches an astonishing degree of resemblance to surroundings, as in the\r\ngolden plover (_Charadrius pluvialis_), whose eggs, like those of the\r\npeewit (_Vanellus cristatus_), are laid among stones and grasses, not\r\nin a true nest, but in a flat depression in the sand, and, protected\r\nby a motley speckling with streaking of white, yellow, grey and brown,\r\nare excellently concealed. Perhaps the eggs of the sandpipers and gulls\r\nare even better protected, for their colouring is a mingling of yellow,\r\nbrown, and grey, which imitates the sand in which they are laid so\r\nperfectly, that one may easily tread on them before becoming aware of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut let us now turn from eggs to adult animals. Darwin first pointed\r\nout that the fauna of great regions may exhibit one and the same\r\nground-colouring, as is the case in the Arctic zone and in the deserts.\r\nThe most diverse inhabitants of these regions show quite similar\r\ncoloration, namely, that which harmonizes with the dominant colour of\r\nthe region itself. It is not only the persecuted animals, which need\r\nprotection, that are sympathetically coloured in these cases, the\r\npersecutors themselves are likewise adapted, and this need not surprise\r\nus, when we remember that the very existence of a beast of prey\r\ndepends on its being able to gain possession of its victims, and that\r\ntherefore it must be of the greatest use to it to contrast as little as\r\npossible with its surroundings, and thus be able to steal on its quarry\r\nunperceived. Those that are best adapted in colour will secure the most\r\nabundant food, and will reproduce most prolifically; and they will thus\r\nhave a better prospect of transmitting their usual colouring to their\r\noffspring. The Polar bear would starve if he were brown or grey, like\r\nhis relatives; among the ice and snow of the Polar regions his victims,\r\nthe seals, would see him coming from afar.\r\n\r\nIn the Arctic zone the adaptation of the colouring of the animals to\r\nthe white of the surroundings is particularly striking. Most of the\r\nmammals there are pure white, or approximately white, at least during\r\nthe long winter; and it is easily understood that they must be so if\r\nthey are to survive in the midst of the snow and ice,--both beasts of\r\nprey and their victims. For the latter the sympathetic colouring is of\r\n'protective' value; for the former, of 'aggressive' value (Poulton).\r\nThus we find not only the Polar hare and the snow-bunting white, but\r\nalso the Arctic fox, the Polar bear, and the great snowy owl; and\r\nthough the brown sable is an exception, that is intelligible enough,\r\nfor he lives on trees, and is best concealed when he cowers close to\r\nthe dark trunk and branches. For him there would be no advantage in\r\nbeing white, and therefore he has not become so.\r\n\r\nDesert animals are also almost all sympathetically coloured, that\r\nis, they are of a peculiarly sandy yellow, or yellowish-brown, or\r\nclayey-yellow, or a mixture of all these colours; and here again the\r\nbeasts of prey and their victims are similarly coloured. The lion must\r\nbe almost invisible from a short distance, when he steals along towards\r\nhis prey, crouching close to the ground; but the camel too, the various\r\nspecies of antelope, the giraffe, all the smaller mammals, and also the\r\nhorned viper (_Vipera cerastes_), the Egyptian spectacled snake (_Naja\r\nhaje_), many lizards, geckos, and the great Varanus, numerous birds,\r\nnot a few insects, especially locusts, show the colours of the desert.\r\nIt is true that the birds often have very conspicuous colours, such as\r\nwhite on breast and under parts, but the upper surface is coloured like\r\nthe desert, and conceals them from pursuers whenever they cower close\r\nto the ground. It has even been observed that a locust of the genus\r\n_Tryxalis_ is of a light sand-colour in the sandy part of the Libyan\r\ndesert, but dark brown in its rocky parts, thus illustrating a double\r\nadaptation in the same species.\r\n\r\nAnother group, which agrees in colour with the general surroundings,\r\nis that of the 'glass-animals,' as they have been called, though\r\nperhaps 'crystal animals' is a better term. A great number of simple\r\nfree-swimming marine forms, and a few fresh-water ones, are quite\r\ncolourless, and perfectly transparent, or have at most a bluish or\r\ngreenish tinge, and on this account they are quite invisible as long as\r\nthey remain in the water. In our lakes there lives a little crustacean\r\nabout a centimetre in length, of the order of water-fleas (_Leptodora\r\nhyalina_), a mighty hunter among the smallest animals, which swims\r\nforward jerkily with its long swimming-appendages, and widely spreads\r\nits six pairs of claws, armed with thorny bristles, like a weir basket,\r\nto seize its prey. We may have dozens of these in a glass of water\r\nwithout being able to see a single one, even when we hold the glass\r\nagainst the light, for the creatures are crystal-clear and transparent,\r\nand have exactly the same refractive power as the water. It requires a\r\nvery sharp scrutiny and a knowledge of the animals to be able to detect\r\nin the water little yellowish stripes, which are the stomachs of the\r\nanimals filled with food in process of digestion, for which, as we can\r\nreadily understand, invisibility cannot very well be arranged. If the\r\nwater be then strained through a fine cloth, a little gelatine-like\r\nmass of the bodies of the _Leptodora_ will remain on the sieve.\r\n\r\nA great many of the lower marine animals are equally transparent,\r\nand as clear as water; most of the lower Medusæ, the ctenophores,\r\nvarious molluscs, the barrel-shaped Salpæ, worms, many crustaceans of\r\nquite different orders, and above all an enormous number of larvæ of\r\nthe most diverse animal groups. I can remember seeing the sea at the\r\nshore at Mentone so full of Salpæ, that in every glass of sea-water\r\ndrawn at random there were many of them, and sometimes a glass held a\r\npositive animal soup. But one did not see them in the glass of water,\r\nand only those who knew what to look for recognized them by the bluish\r\nintestinal sac that lies posteriorly in the invisible body. But when\r\nthe water was poured off through a fine net, there remained on the\r\nfilter a large mass of a crystalline gelatinous substance.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this must serve as a protective arrangement, for the\r\nanimals are not seen by their pursuers; but it is not an _absolute_\r\nprotection, for they have many pursuers who do not wait till they see\r\ntheir prey, but are almost constantly snapping the mouth open and\r\nshut, leaving it to chance to bring them their prey. _No protective\r\narrangement, however, affords absolute security_; it protects against\r\nsome enemies, perhaps against many, but never against all.\r\n\r\nBut now let us turn to a group of a different colouring, the green\r\nanimals. We are familiar with our big grass-green grasshopper, and\r\nwe know how easily it is overlooked when it sits quietly on a high\r\ngrass-stem, surrounded by grasses and herbage; the light grass-green of\r\nits whole body protects it most effectively from discovery: for myself,\r\nat least, I must confess that in a flowery meadow I have stood right\r\nin front of one, and have looked close to it for a long time without\r\ndetecting it. In the same way countless insects of the most diverse\r\ngroups--bugs, dipterous flies, sawflies, butterflies--and especially\r\nthe larvæ (caterpillars) of the last, are of the same green as the\r\nplants on which they live, and this again applies to the predaceous\r\nspecies, as well as the species preyed upon. Thus the rapacious\r\npraying-mantis (_Mantis religiosa_) is as green as the grass in which\r\nit lurks motionless for its victim--a dragonfly, a fly, or a butterfly.\r\n\r\nThere are also green spiders, green amphibians like the edible frog,\r\nand especially the tree-frog, green reptiles like lizards and the\r\ntree-snakes of tropical forests. It is always animals which live among\r\ngreen that are green in colour.\r\n\r\nWe may wonder, for a moment, why there are so few green birds, since\r\nthey spend so much of their time among the green leaves. But this\r\npaucity of green birds is only true of temperate climates. In Germany\r\nwe have only the green woodpecker, the siskin, and a few other little\r\nbirds, and even these are not of a bright green, but are rather\r\ngreyish-green. The explanation lies in the long winter, when the\r\ntrees are leafless. In the evergreen forests of the tropics there are\r\nnumerous green birds belonging to very diverse families.\r\n\r\nYet another group with a common colour-adaptation deserves mention--the\r\nbeasts of the night. They are all more or less grey, brown, yellowish,\r\nor a mixture of these colours, and it is obvious that, in the\r\nduskiness of night, they must blend better with their environment on\r\nthis account. White mice and white rats cannot exist under natural\r\nconditions, since they are conspicuous in the night, and the same would\r\nbe true of white bats, nightjars, and owls; but all of these have a\r\ncoloration suited to nocturnal habits.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable fact is that in many animals the colour-adaptation\r\nis a double one. Thus the Arctic fox is white only in winter, while in\r\nsummer he is greyish-brown; the ermine changes in the same way, and the\r\ngreat white snowy owl of the Arctic regions has in summer a grey-brown\r\nvariegated plumage. Many animals which are subject to persecution\r\nalso change colour with the seasons, like the mountain hare (_Lepus\r\nvariabilis_), which is brown in summer and pure white in winter, the\r\nLapland lemming, and the ptarmigan (_Lagopus alpinus_), which do the\r\nsame. It has been doubted whether natural selection can explain this\r\ndouble coloration, but I do not know where the difficulty lies, and\r\nthere is certainly no other principle whose aid we can evoke. The\r\nmountain hare must have had some sort of colour before it attained to\r\nseasonal dimorphism. Let us assume that it was brown, that the climate\r\nbecame colder and the winter longer, then those hares would have most\r\nchance of surviving which became lighter in winter, and so a white race\r\nwas formed. Poulton has shown that the whiteness is due to the fact\r\nthat the dark hairs of the summer coat grow white as they lengthen at\r\nthe beginning of winter, and the abundance of new hairs which complete\r\nthe winter coat are from the first white throughout. If the white hairs\r\nwere to persist throughout the summer it would be very disadvantageous\r\nto their wearer; so a double selection must take place, in summer the\r\nindividuals which remain white, in winter those which remain brown,\r\nbeing most frequently eliminated, so that only those would be left\r\nwhich were brown in summer and white in winter. This double selection\r\nwould be favoured by the fact that there would be, in any case, a\r\nchange of fur at the beginning of summer; the winter hairs fall out\r\nand the fur becomes thinner. The process does not differ essentially\r\nfrom that which takes place in any species when two or more parts or\r\ncharacters, which are not directly connected, have to be changed, such\r\nas, for instance, colour and fertility. The struggle for existence will\r\nin this case be favourable, on the one hand, to the advantageously\r\ncoloured, and on the other to the most fertile, and though the two\r\ncharacters may at first only occur separately, they will soon be united\r\nby free crossing, until ultimately only those individuals will occur\r\nwhich are at once the most favourably coloured and the most fertile.\r\nSo in this case there remain only those which are brown in summer and\r\nwhite in winter.\r\n\r\nWe must ascribe to the influence of the processes of selection the\r\nexact regulation of the duration of the winter and summer dress, which\r\nhas been carefully studied in the case of the variable hare. In the\r\nhigh Alps it remains white for six or seven months, in the south of\r\nNorway for eight months, in Northern Norway for nine months, and in\r\nNorthern Greenland it never loses its white coat at all, as there\r\nthe snow, even in summer, melts only in some places and for a short\r\ntime. But apart from concealment there is certainly another adaptation\r\ninvolved here--namely, the growth of the hair as a protection against\r\nthe cold. From an old experiment made in 1835 by Captain J. Ross, and\r\nrecently brought to light again by Poulton, we learn that a captive\r\nlemming kept in a room in winter did not change colour until it was\r\nexposed to the cold. The constitution of animals which become white in\r\nwinter is thus so organized that the setting in of cold weather acts\r\nas a stimulus which incites the skin to the production of white hairs.\r\nThis predisposition also we must refer to the influence of natural\r\nselection, since it must have been very useful to the species that the\r\nwinter coat should grow just when it was necessary as a protection\r\nagainst cold. This explains at the same time why the predisposition\r\nto respond to the stimulus of cold by a growth of winter fur finds\r\nexpression earlier in those colonies of Arctic animals, such as the\r\nhare, which live in Lapland, than in those which live in the south of\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nBut that it is not the _direct_ influence of cold which colours the\r\nhair of a furred animal white we can see from our common hare (_Lepus\r\ntimidus_), which, in spite of the winter's cold, does not become white,\r\nbut retains its brown coat, and not less so from the mountain hare\r\n(_Lepus variabilis_), which in the south of Sweden also remains brown,\r\nalthough the winter there may be exceedingly cold. But as the covering\r\nof the ground with snow is not so uninterrupted there as in the higher\r\nNorth, a white coat would be not a better protection than a brown\r\none, but a worse. The white colouring of Arctic animals is therefore\r\nnot directly due to the influence of the climate, as has often been\r\nmaintained, but is due to it indirectly, that is, through the operation\r\nof natural selection. I have tried to make this clear by means of this\r\nexample, so that we may not have to repeat it in considering those\r\nwhich are to follow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut all attempts at any other explanation are even more decidedly\r\nexcluded when we turn our attention to more complicated cases of\r\ncolour-adaptation, which are not confined to the simple, general\r\ncoloration, but are helped by markings and colour-patterns, that is, by\r\nschemes of colour.\r\n\r\nThus numerous caterpillars exhibit definite lines and spots on their\r\nground-colouring, which, in one way or another, aid in protecting them\r\nfrom their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe green grass-eating caterpillar of many of our _Satyridæ_ has two or\r\nmore darker or lighter lines running down the sides of its body, which\r\nmake it much less conspicuous among the grasses on which it feeds than\r\nif it were a uniform green mass (Fig. 2). Not infrequently the colour\r\nand form present a remarkably close resemblance to the inflorescences\r\nor fruit-ears of the grasses. Caterpillars marked thus are never found\r\non the leaves of trees, where they would immediately catch the eye. It\r\nis true that longitudinal striping often occurs on caterpillars which\r\nlive on other plants besides grass, but as these other plants grow\r\namong the grasses the protective efficacy is just the same. This is\r\nthe case with the Pieridæ (Garden Whites).\r\n\r\nAll the caterpillars of our Sphingidæ, on the other hand, which live\r\non bushes and trees, have on the sides of the segments light oblique\r\nstripes, seven in number, which are disposed to the longitudinal axis\r\nof the body at the same angle as the lateral veins of a leaf of their\r\nfood-plant have to the mid-rib. It cannot of course be said that the\r\ncaterpillar thereby gains the appearance of a leaf, indeed, if one sees\r\nit apart from its food-plant it does not look in the least like a leaf,\r\nbut among the leaves of a bush or tree this marking secures it in a\r\nhigh degree from discovery. Thus the caterpillar of the eyed hawk-moth\r\n(_Smerinthus ocellatus_), when it is sitting among the crowded foliage\r\nof a willow, is often very difficult to find, because its large green\r\nbody does not appear as a single green spot, but is divided by the\r\noblique lateral stripes into sections like the half of a willow leaf,\r\nso that even a searching glance is led astray, there being nothing to\r\nfocus attention on the animal as distinguished from its surroundings\r\n(Fig. 3). As a boy I often had the interesting experience of\r\noverlooking a caterpillar which was sitting just before me, until after\r\na time I chanced to hit upon the exact spot in the field of vision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Longitudinally striped caterpillar of a Satyrid.\r\nAfter Rösel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Full-grown caterpillar of the Eyed Hawk-moth,\r\n_Smerinthus ocellatus_. _sb_, the subdorsal stripe.]\r\n\r\nIn the majority of these caterpillars with oblique stripes, the\r\nlikeness to the half of a leaf is heightened by the fact that the light\r\noblique row is accompanied by a broader coloured band, suggesting the\r\nshade of the leaf's mid-rib. The caterpillar of _Sphinx ligustri_\r\nhas a lilac band, and that of _Sphinx atropos_ a blue one. In both\r\ncases it is difficult to believe that such striking colours can\r\nsecure the animals from discovery, yet among the blending shadows\r\nof the leaf-complex of their food-plant they greatly increase their\r\nresemblance to a leaf-surface. Of the death's-head caterpillar\r\n(_Sphinx atropos_) this sounds almost incredible, for this form is\r\nchiefly a bright golden yellow, and the narrow white oblique stripes\r\nhave sky-blue borders becoming darker towards the under side; but it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the potato is not the true food-plant of\r\nthe species, for it lives, in its true home in Africa, and also in the\r\nsouth of Spain, on wild solanaceous plants, which, we are informed\r\nby Noll, have precisely these colours--golden-yellow and blue in the\r\nblossom, the fruit, and in part also in the leaves and stem. There the\r\ncaterpillars sit the whole day long on the plants, while with us they\r\nhave formed the habit of feeding only in the twilight and at night, and\r\nconcealing themselves in the earth by day, a habit that is found in\r\nother caterpillars also, and which we must again ascribe to a process\r\nof natural selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Full-grown caterpillar of the Elephant Hawk-moth\r\n(_Chærocampa elpenor_) in its \"terrifying attitude.\"]\r\n\r\nSome caterpillars exhibit other, more complex markings, which do not\r\nprotect them by rendering them difficult to detect, but by terrifying\r\nthe enemy who has discovered them, and warning him away. Such\r\nterrifying or aggressive colours are to be found, for instance, in the\r\ncaterpillars of the Sphingid genus _Chærocampa_ in the form of large\r\neye-like spots, which occur in pairs close together on the fourth\r\nand fifth segments of the animal. Children and those unfamiliar with\r\nanimals take these for true eyes; and as the caterpillar, when it is\r\nthreatened by an enemy, draws in the head and anterior segments, so\r\nthat the fourth one is greatly distended, the eye-spots seem to stand\r\non a thick head (Fig. 4), and it cannot be wondered at that the smaller\r\nbirds, lizards, and other enemies are so terrified that they refrain\r\nfrom attacking. Even hens hesitate to seize such a caterpillar in its\r\ndefiant attitude, and I once looked on for a long time in a hen-coop\r\nwhile one hen after another rushed to pick up a caterpillar I had\r\nplaced there, but, when close to it, hastily drew back the head already\r\nprepared to strike. Even a gallant cock was a long time in making\r\nup his mind to attack the terrible beast, and drew back repeatedly\r\nbefore he at length ventured to strike a deadly blow with his bill.\r\nAfter the first stroke the caterpillar, of course, was lost. Thus even\r\nthis disguise is only a _relative_ protection, effective only against\r\nsmaller enemies. But that these are really frightened away, I had once\r\nan opportunity of observing, when I put a caterpillar of the common\r\nelephant hawk-moth (_Chærocampa elpenor_) in the feeding-trough of a\r\nhencoop, and a sparrow flew down to feed from the trough. It descended\r\nat first with its back to the caterpillar and fed cheerily. But when by\r\nchance it turned round, and spied the caterpillar, it scurried hastily\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAmong Lepidoptera, too, eye-spots often occur on the wings, and to\r\nsome extent, at least, they have in this case also the significance of\r\nwarning marks. Take, for instance, the large blue and black eye-spots\r\non the posterior wings of the eyed hawk-moth (_Smerinthus ocellatus_).\r\nWhen the insect is sitting quietly the two spots are not visible, as\r\nthey are covered by the anterior wings, but as soon as the creature is\r\nalarmed it spreads all four wings, and now both eyes stand boldly out\r\non the red posterior wings and alarm the assailant, as they give the\r\nimpression of the head of a much larger animal (see Fig. 5). There are\r\nalso eye-like spots which have not this significance and effect, as,\r\nfor instance, the 'eye-spots' on the train-feathers of the peacock and\r\nthe Argus pheasant, or the little eye-like spots on the under surface\r\nof many diurnal butterflies. In the first case, it is a matter of\r\ndecoration; in the second, perhaps of the mimicry of dewdrops, which\r\nincreases still further the resemblance to a withered leaf; but there\r\nare undoubtedly many cases in which the eye-spots serve as means of\r\nfrightening off enemies, and these cases are especially common among\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. The Eyed Hawk-moth in its 'terrifying attitude.']\r\n\r\nSuch warning marks are in no way contradictory to the sympathetic\r\ncolouring of the rest of the body, and indeed we usually find them\r\nin combination with it. In some cases the eye-spot, though very\r\nconspicuous, is covered, as in the eyed hawk-moth, when at rest, by\r\nthe sympathetically coloured parts--in this instance the anterior\r\nwings. In other cases eye-spots of considerable size lie clearly\r\nexposed, but exhibit the same sympathetic colours as the whole of the\r\nrest of the wing-surface. In this case they do not interfere with\r\nthe protective influence of general colouring, because they are only\r\nvisible from a very short distance. This is the case in the large\r\n_Caligo_ species of South America, which only fly for a short time in\r\nthe early morning and in the evening, remaining concealed throughout\r\nthe day in dark shadowy places, where the mingled colouring of brown,\r\ngrey, yellow, and black on the under surfaces of the wings prevents\r\ntheir being recognized from a distance as butterflies at all. But even\r\nthe best sympathetic colouring is not an absolute protection, and when\r\nthe insect is discovered by an enemy near at hand, the terrifying mark,\r\na large deep-black spot on the posterior wing, comes into effect, and\r\nscares the assailant away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Under surface of the wings of _Caligo_.]\r\n\r\nIn such cases the sympathetic colouring was probably the first to\r\narise, and the eye-spot was developed later by a new process of\r\nselection, brought about by the necessity of protecting the species\r\nmore effectively than by mere inconspicuousness alone. In many cases\r\nit can be proved that the power of scaring off an enemy did not begin\r\nwith the formation of the eye-spot, but with the development of a new\r\ninstinct. When the caterpillar of _Chærocampa elpenor_ is attacked\r\nit immediately assumes the defiant attitude described above, but the\r\nsame striking attitude is assumed by the caterpillars of the allied\r\nAmerican genus _Darapsa_, as I learn from an old illustration by Abbot\r\nand Smith, although this form possesses no eye-spots (Fig. 7). Thus,\r\nthen, metaphorically speaking, the caterpillar at first attempted\r\nto scare off its enemy by a terrifying attitude alone, and it was\r\nonly subsequently, in the course of the phyletic evolution, that the\r\neye-spots were added, in the elephant hawk-moths and other species,\r\nto heighten the terrifying effect. But that the eye-spot did not make\r\nits appearance suddenly is proved by several American species of\r\n_Smerinthus_, in which they are much less perfectly developed than in\r\nthe European species. In these Sphingidæ, too, the defiant attitude\r\nwas evolved earlier than the eye-spots, as we may see from our poplar\r\nhawk-moth (_Smerinthus populi_), which, when alarmed, spreads out all\r\nfour wings in the same peculiar manner which in the eyed hawk-moth\r\n(_Smerinthus ocellatus_) displays the eye-spots; it strikes about with\r\nits wings as if to scare off the enemy, an effect which will certainly\r\nbe more surely achieved if, at the same time, a pair of eyes becomes\r\nsuddenly visible.\r\n\r\nSympathetically coloured caterpillars are, however, by no means the\r\nonly ones; there are some with such striking, glaring colours that,\r\nfar from rendering their possessors inconspicuous, they make them\r\nvisible from a long way off; but this apparent contradiction of the\r\ntheory of the colour-adaptation of animals that require protection\r\nhas been explained by the acuteness of Alfred Russel Wallace. We know\r\nthat among insects, and also among caterpillars, there are many which\r\nhave a repulsive taste. In any case, certain caterpillars are rejected\r\nby many birds and lizards. Such species are, therefore, relatively\r\nsafe from being devoured. If they were protectively coloured, or if,\r\nmoreover, they resembled caterpillars with an agreeable taste, they\r\nwould gain little advantage from their unpalatability; for the birds\r\nwould at first take them for eatable, and would only discover their\r\nrepulsiveness on attempting to eat them. But a caterpillar which has\r\nreceived a single stroke from a bird's bill is doomed to death. It must\r\ntherefore be of the greatest advantage for unpalatable caterpillars,\r\nand unpalatable animals generally, to be in their colouring as\r\nconspicuously distinguishable as possible from the edible species.\r\nHence, then, the glaring colours, which we can now refer without any\r\nfurther difficulty to the process of natural selection, for every\r\nindividual of an ill-tasting species that is more conspicuously\r\ncoloured than its fellows must have an advantage over them, and must\r\nhave a better chance of surviving, because it will be less easily\r\nmistaken for a member of an edible species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Caterpillar of a North American _Darapsa_ in its\r\n\"terrifying attitude\" (after Abbot and Smith).]\r\n\r\nI should like to discuss one other phenomenon, which is well calculated\r\nto give us a deeper insight into the transformation processes of\r\norganisms--I refer to the remarkable dimorphism of colour which occurs\r\nin many of the species of caterpillar just described.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the convolvulus hawk-moth (_Sphinx convolvuli_) is\r\nin its full-grown stage green, like the wild convolvulus on which it\r\nlives, or brown like the ground on which its food-plant grows. It thus\r\nshows a double adaptation, each of which is capable of protecting it\r\nto a certain extent, and we might think to the _same_ extent. But that\r\nis not so, the brown colouring is a more effective protection than the\r\ngreen, as we may learn from two facts. In the first place, the four\r\nyoung stages of the caterpillar are green, and it only becomes brown in\r\nthe last stage, though sometimes even then it remains green. This shows\r\nthat the brown is a relatively modern adaptation, and it could not have\r\narisen had it not been better than the original green. In the second\r\nplace, the green-coloured caterpillars of the convolvulus hawk-moth\r\nare nowadays much less numerous than the brown ones, and this implies\r\nthat the latter survive oftener in the struggle for existence. We have\r\nhere an interesting case of an easily recognizable process of selection\r\nstill going on between the old green and the newer brown variety.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to ask why the brown colour should in this case\r\nbe a better protection than the green, for it is obvious that such a\r\nlarge green body as that of the full-grown convolvulus-caterpillar\r\nwould be but badly concealed among the little leaves of the convolvulus\r\nplant in spite of its green colour; while the brown caterpillar, on\r\nthe brown soil, with its pebbles, hollows, and irregular shadows, is\r\nexcellently protected, especially if it passes the day concealed in the\r\nground, as is actually the case.\r\n\r\nOur view is materially strengthened by the fact that the same\r\nphenomenon of double colouring occurs in several allied species of\r\nSphingidæ, but in a manner which shows us that we have to do with a\r\nsimilar process of transformation, only at a more advanced stage. The\r\ncaterpillar of _Chærocampa elpenor_ (Fig. 4) shows the same state of\r\nthings as that of the convolvulus hawk-moth; it is brown or green,\r\nand the green form is the less common. But in the two other European\r\nspecies of _Chærocampa_ the full-grown caterpillar is always brown,\r\nand indeed it becomes brown in the fourth stage, instead of, like\r\n_Chærocampa elpenor_, only in the fifth and last. Another indigenous\r\nsphingid species, _Deilephila vespertilio_, only remains green during\r\nthe first two stages, and assumes in the third stage the grey-brown\r\ncolour which it afterwards retains. The dark colour has obviously\r\nprevailed among the full-grown caterpillars for a considerable\r\nlength of time, for it is in this, the largest and most conspicuous\r\nstage, that the change of colour must have been most necessary, and\r\nconsequently the process of selection must have begun in it, and only\r\nafter the more protective brown became general would it have extended\r\nto the next stage below, if it were of use there too, and, later on,\r\nto still earlier stages in the life-history.\r\n\r\nOne might be inclined to ascribe this shunting back of a new character\r\nfrom the later to the earlier stages of development to purely internal\r\nforces, which brought it about of necessity, and quite independently\r\nof whether the extension of the character was useful or injurious.\r\nWe shall come back to this later, and try to find out how far this\r\nis the case, but in the meantime we may regard at least so much as\r\nestablished, that this shunting back does not take place everywhere and\r\nwithout limits, but that natural selection calls a halt as soon as its\r\neffect would be injurious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Caterpillar of the Buckthorn Hawk-moth,\r\n_Deilephila hippophaës_. _A_, Stage III. _B_, Stage V. _r_, ring-spots.]\r\n\r\nThere could be no continuance of insect-metamorphosis if every\r\ncharacter of the final stage had to be shunted back to the one next\r\nbelow, for then, for instance, the characters of the butterfly must,\r\nin the course of the phyletic evolution, be carried back to the pupa\r\nand larva. But even in the larval stage alone it can be seen that\r\nthis carrying back is kept within well-defined limits. Thus, for\r\ninstance, in the dimorphic caterpillars of the Sphingidæ the brown of\r\nthe full-grown stage never comes so far down as the earliest stages,\r\nfor the little caterpillars are all green, like the leaves and stems\r\non which they sit. On the other hand, there are species in which the\r\ngreen persists, as apparently the most advantageous colour. Thus in\r\nthe buckthorn hawk-moth (_Deilephila hippophaës_) (Fig. 8), which\r\nlives in the warm valleys of the Alps, and especially in Valais, the\r\ncaterpillars are grey-green in all stages, and are exactly of the\r\nshade of the lower surface of the buckthorn leaves; they possess no\r\noblique lines, for these would not make them more like the leaves, as\r\nthe full-grown caterpillars are much bigger than an individual leaf\r\nof buckthorn, on which, moreover, the lateral veins are not very\r\nconspicuous. Nevertheless the caterpillar enjoys very fair security, as\r\nit does not feed through the day, but only in twilight and at night;\r\nit passes the daytime concealed in the dry leaves and earth about the\r\nbase of the bush. Its resemblance to the leaves is very great, and is\r\nincreased by the fact that it bears on the last segment a comparatively\r\nlarge orange-coloured spot (_r_), exactly the colour of the buckthorn\r\nberry, which ripens just at the time that the caterpillar attains its\r\nfull growth.\r\n\r\nBut butterflies are as much persecuted, and have as much need of\r\nprotection, as caterpillars, and among them, too, we find many\r\ninstances of protective colouring, which are the more interesting in\r\nthat they occur, as a rule, only on such parts of the body as remain\r\nvisible when the insect is at rest, which is exactly what we should\r\nexpect if the coloration has been wrought out in the course of natural\r\nselection. But it is well known that the resting position of diurnal\r\nLepidoptera is quite different from that of the nocturnal forms, and is\r\nnot even the same among all families, and in accordance with this we\r\nfind the sympathetic colouring occurs on quite different areas in the\r\ndifferent families.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the butterflies only require to be protected by their\r\ncolour in the sleeping or resting position is that no colour whatever\r\ncould make a flying butterfly invisible to its enemies, because the\r\nbackground against which its body shows is continually changing during\r\nits flight, and, moreover, the movement alone is enough to betray it,\r\neven if it is of a dull colour.\r\n\r\nThus, in general, only those parts of a butterfly's wing that are\r\ninvisible at rest could safely bear bright or conspicuous colour, while\r\nthe visible portions had to acquire sympathetic coloration through\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nAs the diurnal butterflies, when at rest, turn their wings upward and\r\nbring them together, it is only the under side which is sympathetically\r\ncoloured, and that only as far as it is visible, that is, the whole of\r\nthe posterior wing, and as much of the anterior one as is not covered\r\nby it. Many diurnal butterflies, when at rest, fold the anterior wing\r\nso far back that only its tip remains visible, and in such cases only\r\nthis tip is protectively coloured, while in other forms, which have not\r\nthis habit, almost the whole surface of the wing is sympathetically\r\ncoloured.\r\n\r\nA very simple protective colouring is exhibited by our 'lemon\r\nbutterfly' (_Rhodocera rhamni_), in which the under surface is a\r\nwhitish yellow, which protects the insect well when it settles on\r\nthe dry leaves on the ground in the light woods which it is fond of\r\nfrequenting.\r\n\r\nOur gayest diurnal butterflies, the species of _Vanessa_, all have the\r\nunder surface of a dusky colour, sometimes passing into a blackish\r\nbrown, as in the peacock-butterfly, _Vanessa_ (_v. io_), sometimes\r\nmore into greyish brown, or brown-yellow, or reddish brown. They are\r\nnever simple colours, but always consist of mixtures of different\r\ncolour-tones--indeed, there is often a complex mingling of many\r\ncolours, as grey, brown, black, white, green, blue, yellow, and red,\r\nmade up of dots, strokes, spots, and rings, into a wonderful and\r\nvery constant pattern, which, taken as a whole, has the effect of\r\nbeing uniform, and harmonizes with the soil, or with the highway, on\r\nwhich the species loves to settle, with much greater accuracy than a\r\nmonochrome grey or brown would do. When the 'painted lady' (_Vanessa\r\ncardui_) settles on the ground it is hardly distinguishable from\r\nit, and this species in particular has a preference for settling\r\non the ground. Other species of _Vanessa_, such as the peacock and\r\nthe Camberwell beauty (_Vanessa antiopa_), are underneath of a dark\r\nblackish grey, or even black; when resting they press themselves into\r\nthe darkest corners and crevices, and are thus most effectively secured\r\nfrom discovery.\r\n\r\nMany diurnal Lepidoptera, on the other hand, especially the\r\nwood-butterflies of the family Satyridæ, have the habit of resting\r\non the trunks of trees, as _Satyrus proserpina_ does on the great\r\nbeech-trunks of the forest clearings. These large butterflies, coloured\r\nconspicuously on the upper surface in deep velvety black and white, are\r\nmarked on the under surface exactly to match the whitish bark of the\r\ngreat beech, covered over with white, grey, blackish-brown, and yellow\r\nspots, and the butterfly whose flight one has just been carefully\r\nfollowing disappears as it suddenly alights on such a tree-trunk. As I\r\nhave already stated, the protective colour only extends over as much\r\nof the insect as is seen when it is at rest. As the anterior wings are\r\nfolded far back between the posterior ones, the protective colouring is\r\nlimited to the whole surface of the posterior wing, and the tip of the\r\nanterior one, as far as that is visible in the resting attitude; the\r\nprotectively coloured area is somewhat sharply bounded, and it is often\r\nof very different extent in quite nearly allied species, according\r\nto whether the species folds the anterior wing far back or not. Thus\r\nin our common small tortoiseshell-butterfly (_Vanessa urticæ_) the\r\nprotective area is considerably wider than in the large tortoiseshell\r\n(_Vanessa polychloros_), much as the two resemble each other in other\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThis harmony between the wing tips and the posterior wings is nowhere\r\nwanting, where the under side is protectively coloured at all, but in\r\nmany cases the protective colouring spreads over almost the whole of\r\nthe anterior wings, and these are then not folded far back when at\r\nrest, as will be seen later in the so-called leaf-butterflies.\r\n\r\nThere is one genus of diurnal butterflies which seems to contradict\r\nthe law that all the surface that is visible in the resting position\r\nexhibits the protective coloration--the South American wood-butterflies\r\nof the genus _Ageronia_. They have on the upper surface a very\r\ncomplicated bark-like pattern of mingled grey on grey, and this\r\nconfirms the usual rule, for we know that these butterflies--a striking\r\nexception among all the other diurnal forms--settle with outspread\r\nwings on the trunk of a tree in exactly the same attitude as many of\r\nthe nocturnal Lepidoptera of the family of the Loopers or Geometridæ,\r\nin which the upper surface is also deceptively like the bark of the\r\ntree on which they rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. _Hebomoja glaucippe_, from India; under surface.\r\n_A_, in flight. _B_, in resting attitude.]\r\n\r\nIn all the nocturnal Lepidoptera it is the _upper_ side of the wing\r\nwhich is sympathetically coloured, if protective coloration has been\r\ndeveloped at all. In all the Sphingidæ, many 'Owls' and Bombycidæ, the\r\nanterior wings are grey banded with darker zigzag lines, and mottled\r\nwith many shades of black, grey, yellow, red, and even violet. As the\r\nanterior wings cover the body and the posterior wings like a roof,\r\nthey make the resting insect very inconspicuous when it has settled\r\non wooden fences, trunks of trees, or even old timber. When bright\r\ncolours--red, yellow, or blue--occur in these moths it is always on\r\nthe posterior wings, which are covered when at rest. This can best be\r\nobserved in the species of the genus _Catocala_.\r\n\r\nLet us now, however, interrupt our survey of the facts for a moment,\r\nand let us inquire whether all the cases of protective colouring in\r\nLepidoptera we have considered can be referred to natural selection, or\r\nwhether it is not conceivable that other causes may have evoked them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. _Xylina vetusta_, after Rösel. _A_, in flight.\r\n_B_, at rest.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be said is that the Lamarckian principle of the\r\ninherited effects of use and disuse cannot here be taken into account,\r\nas the colours of the surface of the body do not exercise any active\r\nfunction at all; their effect is due simply to their presence, and\r\nit is for them quite indifferent whether and how often they have\r\nopportunity to protect their bearers from enemies, or whether no\r\nenemies ever chance to appear. It has frequently been suggested, too,\r\nthat these colorations are associated with the differences in the\r\nstrength of the illumination to which the different parts and surfaces\r\nare exposed. But this again is untenable, as is proved even by the\r\ndimorphism frequently occurring in caterpillars, for the green and\r\nthe brown individuals are exposed to precisely the same light; and\r\nstill more clearly by the sympathetic colouring, which is so exactly\r\ndefined and yet so different on the under surface of the diurnal\r\nbutterflies. Yet there are isolated cases in which it seems as if\r\nthe direct influence of the light had brought about certain striking\r\ndifferences in the colouring of the parts of an insect, and I shall\r\ndescribe perhaps the prettiest of these cases, to which Brunner von\r\nWattenwyl directed attention. It concerns one of the Orthoptera of\r\nAustralia, a Phasmid, _Tropidoderus childreni_, Grey, which has a\r\ngeneral colouring of leaf-green, but with singular deviations from it\r\non certain areas of the body. In this insect the anterior wings which\r\nform the wing covers or elytra (Fig. 11, _V_) are so short that they\r\nscarcely cover the half of the long abdomen. Their place is taken by\r\nthe anterior margin of the posterior wing (_H. horn_), which is hard\r\nand horny like the elytra, and in the resting position protects the\r\nwhole abdomen. All these covering parts are grass-green, except at the\r\nplaces where they overlap; on these areas they have a faded look, and\r\nare yellowish instead of green. Brunner says of this: 'The phenomenon\r\ngives the impression that the more brilliant colour is a character due\r\nto daylight. If several sheets of white paper of unequal dimensions be\r\nplaced one above the other, ... and exposed to the sun, after a short\r\ntime silhouettes of the smaller sheets will appear on the larger ones,\r\neither in a lighter or in a darker colour. Probably this \"fading\"\r\nof the covered parts in the Phasmid also belongs to this \"category\r\nof photographs.\"' This seems convincing, but analogous phenomena in\r\nother insects prevent our regarding the pretty comparison with the\r\nphotograph as a sufficient explanation. If it were a question of a\r\ndiurnal butterfly, such an assumption would have to be rejected on this\r\nground alone, that the wing colouring is developed in the pupa, and\r\nappears perfect and unalterable as soon as the perfect insect emerges.\r\nBut in the pupa the position of the wings is exactly the reverse\r\nof that seen in the resting attitude of a butterfly, that is, the\r\nprotectively coloured under side of the wing is not turned towards the\r\nlight but away from it. Moreover, in the pupa the anterior wings cover\r\nthe posterior ones completely, no matter what the wing position may be\r\nlater in the perfect insect. Furthermore, the thick and often darkly\r\ncoloured sheath of the pupa prevents the light having any effect, and\r\nnot a few species pass their pupal stage in such dark places--for\r\ninstance, under stones, as in the case of many 'Blues'--that the light\r\ncan hardly reach them. And if the light did exercise an influence, how\r\ncould it produce such diverse coloration as the protective colours of\r\ndiurnal butterflies, on the one side dark, even to blackness, on the\r\nother side, yellow, reddish, and even white and pure green; and how\r\nshould the same rays of light call forth complicated colour patterns\r\non one and the same surface, for instance, the white, sprinkled with\r\ngreen, of the Aurora butterfly (_Anthocharis cardaminis_)? Finally, we\r\nhave only to remember that numerous nocturnal Lepidoptera pass through\r\ntheir pupa stage underground, although they exhibit brilliant as well\r\nas protective colours in the most appropriate distribution, to reject\r\nonce for all the hypothesis that the influence of light plays any\r\ndecisive rôle in determining the distribution of the colours on the\r\nwings of Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\nBut it is otherwise with _Tropidoderus_. In this case the wings grow\r\ngradually during the slow growth of the animal, which takes place in\r\nfull light, and the wings of the young insect probably lie one above\r\nthe other, in exactly the same position, and cover the same places as\r\nin the full-grown form; we might, therefore, from the facts of the\r\ncase, admit the possibility that the yellow of the covered portions is\r\ndue to the exclusion of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. _Tropidoderus childreni_, after Brunner von\r\nWattenwyl, in flying pose. _V_ anterior wing. _H. häut_, membranous\r\npart of posterior wing. _H. horn_, horny portion.]\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the conditions that obtain among Lepidoptera are\r\nalso taken into consideration we recognize the insufficiency of the\r\ninterpretation suggested, for among butterflies we have precisely the\r\nsame phenomenon--sharp limitation of the protective colouring to the\r\nparts visible in the resting position, a fact which, in the case of\r\nthe said butterflies, admits of no other interpretation than that of\r\nnatural selection. Let us therefore see if we cannot, in the case of\r\n_Tropidoderus_, arrive at some better understanding of the phenomenon\r\nthan that implied in the theory of direct light-influence. Obviously,\r\nthe yellow parts of the animal do not require to be green, since they\r\nare not visible in the sitting position, and the locust in flight could\r\nnot by any device be made invisible. It therefore only remains to be\r\nexplained why the yellow parts are not colourless, and why they are\r\nnot also green. We cannot at present answer with any confidence; it is\r\npossible that the colouring matter which causes the green only becomes\r\ngreen under the influence of direct sunlight, and otherwise remains\r\nyellow; it is possible, too, that, as in Lepidoptera (see Fig. 9), the\r\nfull protective colour is only developed by natural selection in the\r\nplaces which are visible in the sitting position, and that the covered\r\nparts take on any indifferent colour, which might be readily afforded\r\nby the metabolism of the insect. But this much is certain, that the\r\ncovered parts would be green, if that were advantageous to the survival\r\nof the species, just as the under surface of the wings of some diurnal\r\nbutterflies is green. Had it been required, the green colour would have\r\nresulted in the course of natural selection, just as it has resulted\r\nin the most different parts of the most diverse insects, even in those\r\nwhose development takes place entirely removed from the influence of\r\nlight. Therein lies the difference between our interpretation and that\r\nof Brunner von Wattenwyl: without natural selection no explanation of\r\nthis case is possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. _Notodonta camelina_, after Rösel. _A_, in\r\nflight. _B_, at rest.]\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken only of the diurnal butterflies in which the\r\nanterior wings show an extension of the protective colouring which\r\nmarks the whole surface of the posterior wings, and it was always the\r\ntips of the anterior wings that were thus coloured. But among the\r\nnocturnal Lepidoptera there are corresponding cases, in which a little\r\ntip of the posterior wing forms the continuation of the protective\r\nsurface of the anterior wing. Some species of _Notodonta_ and allied\r\ngenera show in the posterior corner of the otherwise whitish posterior\r\nwings a little grey spot, and a hair tuft which in colour, and--when it\r\nis big enough--in marking, exactly resembles the protectively coloured\r\nanterior wings (Fig. 12). The 'why' is at once clear, when one looks at\r\nthe insect in the resting position, for only this little corner of the\r\nwing projects beyond the covering anterior wing. This has been regarded\r\nas telling against natural selection, for such a little spot could not\r\npossibly, by its colour, turn the scale as to the life or death of the\r\nindividual, and so could not be selected. But one might say the same of\r\nthe tip of the anterior wing in the diurnal forms, although there the\r\nprotective surface is larger, often much larger. But who is to decide\r\nhow large an exposed, unprotected spot must be in order to attract\r\nthe attention of an enemy on the look out for food? Or who can prove\r\nthat the best and most familiar protective colouring really protects\r\nits possessors? What if, after all, it is all a game, a joke, which\r\nthe Creator is playing with us poor mortals? Did not a trustworthy\r\nobserver recently watch carefully, and see how a pair of sparrows daily\r\ncleared a wooden fence on which moths of the genus _Catocala_ and other\r\nspecies of nocturnal Lepidoptera, excellently furnished with protective\r\ncolours, were wont to settle by day? They did their work thoroughly,\r\nand hardly overlooked a single individual. But who has a right to see\r\nanything more in this than--what surely goes without saying--that the\r\nbest protective colouring is not an absolute protection, and never\r\npreserves all from destruction, but always only some, and it may be\r\nvery few.\r\n\r\nHow else could there be such a high ratio of elimination, and such a\r\nconstancy in the number of individuals of a species on any unchanging\r\narea? These sparrows had simply made full use of an experience,\r\nprobably acquired by chance to begin with, and their vision had become\r\nsharpened for this particular species on the almost similarly coloured\r\nwooden fence, just as that of the expert butterfly collector does. It\r\ncertainly does not follow from this that the protective colouring was\r\nuseless, nor can we regard the harmony between the protruding tip of\r\nthe anterior or posterior wing and the large protectively coloured\r\nsurface of the covering wing as of no importance. On the contrary, if\r\nthe tips were white or conspicuously coloured like the rest of the\r\nposterior wing, they would assuredly attract the sharp eye of hungry\r\nenemies to the spot, and so betray the victim. Instead of this, the\r\nspot in question is not only dark, but, in the case of _Notodonta_, is\r\nfurnished with a tuft of hairs, which, in the insect's resting position\r\n(Fig. 12, _B_), lies on the back, and looks like a dark, somewhat\r\ncurved projecting tooth, in front of which there stands another, quite\r\nsimilar, which arises from the anterior wing, and behind there are\r\nother seven, rather smaller, dark teeth of the same kind, springing\r\nfrom the outer edge of the anterior wing. Taken altogether, they mimic\r\nthe dentated edge of a withered leaf, and thus, in spite of their\r\ndiverse origins, form a unified picture, and one with a considerable\r\nprotective value. How is it possible to doubt that each of these\r\nhair-tufts has arisen under the influence of natural selection, and\r\nthat its absence or imperfect development might result in the discovery\r\nand elimination of the insect concerned?\r\n\r\nThese cases seem to me particularly beautiful proofs of the productive\r\nefficiency of selection. The wing is protected just as far as it\r\nprotrudes from beneath the other--not a millimetre further! How should\r\nit be otherwise, when the colouring of the parts just beside these is\r\nindifferent for the species, so that any variations in these parts in\r\nthe direction of protective colouring never survive to be transmitted\r\nand accumulated?\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this restriction to what is absolutely necessary that\r\nis the surest sign, here and elsewhere, that the character in question\r\nhas been brought about by natural selection. And if this is the only\r\npossible, and at the same time quite sufficient explanation of the\r\nremarkably well-defined colour deliminations in all Lepidoptera,\r\nthere can be no reason why we should try to drag in any other factor\r\nto explain the case of _Tropidoderus_, the less so as here again\r\nselection alone can account for the green of the exposed surfaces;\r\nand furthermore, the modification, common in other Phasmidæ, of the\r\nmost anterior green stripe of the posterior wing into a firm cover\r\nprotecting the soft abdomen, also points to natural selection; the\r\ncover-wings proper have here become too short, and so the edge of\r\nthe posterior wing has been modified into a hard rib, which protects\r\nthe soft body of the insect (Fig. 11, _H. horn_). No differences in\r\nillumination, and no _direct_ effect of any external influence whatever\r\ncould have brought that about.\r\n\r\nHow much more I might adduce in this connexion! The manifold diversity\r\nof colour and form adaptation is so great among insects, to which\r\nprotection from their enemies is so necessary, and especially among\r\nbutterflies, that I should never come to an end if I were to try to\r\ngive even an approximate idea of it. Let us, therefore, turn now from\r\nsuch cases to a higher--the highest--grade of adaptation, that in which\r\nthere is not only a mimicry of special and complex coloration, but in\r\nwhich the whole animal has become like some external object, and is\r\nthereby secured from discovery.\r\n\r\nWe must first consider the case of our lappet moth (_Gastropacha\r\nquercifolia_), which in its copper-red colour and in the remarkable\r\nshape and dentated edges of its wings, and finally in the quite\r\nextraordinary clucking-hen-like attitude of the wings when at rest,\r\ngreatly resembles some dry oak-leaves lying one above the other.\r\n\r\nNot unlike this is a 'shark' moth found in this country, _Xylina\r\nobsoleta_, which, as the name indicates, looks when at rest like a\r\nbroken bit of half-rotten wood (Fig. 10, p. 77). It 'feigns death,' as\r\nwe commonly say, that is, it draws the legs and antennæ close to the\r\nbody, and does not move; indeed, one may lift it up and throw it on the\r\nground without its betraying by a single twitch that it lives. Only\r\nafter it has been left undisturbed for some time does it show signs of\r\nlife again, and makes off hastily, to find a better hiding-place. The\r\ncolouring of this moth is so curiously mingled--brown, whitish, black,\r\nand yellow--and traced with acute-angled lines and curves, that one\r\ncannot distinguish it at sight from a bit of rotten wood. I experienced\r\nthat myself once when, passing a hedge, I thought I saw a _Xylina_\r\nsitting on the ground, and picked it up to examine it. I thought it was\r\na bit of wood, and, disappointed, I threw it down again on the grass,\r\nbut then I felt uncertain, and picked it up once more--to find that it\r\nwas a moth after all[1]!\r\n\r\n[1] Rösel says in this connexion: 'The marvellous form of this Papilio\r\npreserves it from injuries, for, when he hangs freely on a trunk of a\r\ntree, he would be taken ten times sooner for a piece of bark than for\r\na living creature. By day, too, he is so little sensitive, that if he\r\nbe thrown down from his resting-place he falls to the ground as if\r\nlifeless, and remains lying motionless. One may also throw him into\r\nthe air, or turn him about, and he will rarely give a sign of life.\r\nI have impaled many of them on needles, without seeing any sign of\r\nsensitiveness on their part. This is the more remarkable that these\r\nbirds (sic), after they have submitted to all the torment and misery\r\none can inflict on them, without showing any sign of feeling, will,\r\nwhenever they are left in peace and have no further disturbances\r\nto fear, quickly creep off to a dark corner and attempt to conceal\r\nthemselves from future attacks.'--_Insektenbelustigungen_, Nürnberg,\r\n1746, vol. i. p. 52.\r\n\r\nThis case of _Xylina_ is hardly less remarkable, and its likeness to\r\nthe mimicked object is scarcely less wonderful than that of the often\r\ndiscussed mimicry of a leaf, with stalk, midrib, and lateral veins, by\r\nmany of the forest butterflies of South America and India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. _Kallima paralecta_, from India, right under\r\nside of the butterfly at rest. _K_, head. _Lt_, maxillary palps. _B_,\r\nlimbs. _V_, anterior wing. _H_, posterior wing. _St_, 'tail' of the\r\nlatter, corresponding to the stalk of the leaf. _gl_^1 and _gl_^2,\r\ntransparent spots. _Aufl_, eye-spots. _Sch_, mould-spots.]\r\n\r\nThe best known of these is the Indian _Kallima paralecta_, which, when\r\nit settles, is deceptively like a dead leaf, or rather like a dry or\r\na half-withered one, on which brown alternates with red, and on which\r\nthere are one or two translucent spots, without scales, presumably\r\nrepresenting dewdrops. The upper surface of this butterfly is simply\r\nmarked, but gorgeously coloured--blue-black with a reddish yellow,\r\nor bluish white band--and quite constant. The under surface, on the\r\nother hand, although it always resembles a dead leaf, shows very\r\nvaried ground colours, being sometimes greyish, sometimes yellowish,\r\nor reddish yellow, or even greenish. Often it shows the lateral\r\nveining of the leaf quite as distinctly as in Fig. 13, but often quite\r\nindistinctly, and the black, mouldy spots (_Sch_) of our figure may\r\nbe more strongly marked, or they may be absent. It would seem as if\r\nthe mimicry of different kinds of leaves was here aimed at--so to\r\nspeak--just as in the case of the varied and numerous species of the\r\nSouth American genus _Anæa_, which usually live in the woods, and are\r\nall more or less leaf-like, but each species is like a different leaf,\r\nor like a leaf in a different condition, dry, moist, or decomposing.\r\nIt is simply astounding to see this diversity of leaf mimicry, and\r\nthe extraordinary faithfulness with which the impression of the leaf\r\nis reproduced. But it is by no means always the venation which causes\r\nthe resemblance, for this is often inconspicuous; the high degree\r\nof deceptiveness is due to the silvery-clear yellow, dark yellow,\r\nred-brown to dark black-brown ground-colouring, which is never quite\r\nuniform, and over which there usually spreads a whitish ripple,\r\ncombined with the remarkable imitation of the sheen of many leaves. The\r\nupper side of this butterfly is almost always conspicuously decorated\r\nwith violet, dark blue or red, but always without any relation to the\r\nunder surface. Not in all, but in many of the species of this genus,\r\nwe find the round, translucent mirrors on the wing already mentioned\r\nin the case of _Kallima_, and in some species quite remarkable means\r\nare made use of to make the resemblance to a leaf thoroughly deceptive.\r\nThus _Anæa polyxo_, when sitting, looks like a leaf out of the edge\r\nof which a caterpillar has eaten a little piece; in reality there is\r\nnothing missing from the wing, but on the front margin of the anterior\r\nwing a semicircular spot of a bright, soft, yellow colour stands out so\r\nsharply from the rest of the chestnut-brown wing surface, that it has\r\nthe effect of a hole in the leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. _Cœnophlebia archidona_, from Bolivia, in its\r\nresting attitude. _mr_, midrib of the apparent leaf. _st_, the apparent\r\nstalk.]\r\n\r\nA modern opponent of the selection theory (Eimer) has suggested\r\nthat the marking of the lateral veins, and other resemblances to a\r\nleaf in _Kallima_, represent nothing more than the pattern which\r\nwas present in any case, inherited from ancestors, and which in the\r\ncourse of time arranged itself in a particular manner according to\r\ninternal developmental laws. Not selection--that is, adaptation to\r\nsurroundings--but the internal developmental impulse has brought about\r\nthe resemblance to the leaf. It is astonishing how a preconceived\r\nidea can blind a man and weaken his judgment! It goes without saying\r\nthat the adaptations do not start from a _tabula rasa_, but from\r\nwhat is already present; of course, natural selection makes use of\r\nthe markings inherited from ancestors; it takes what already exists,\r\nand alters or extends it as suits best. Thus it is easy to prove\r\nthat the clear mirrors (Fig. 13, _gl_^1 and _gl_^2) on the wings of\r\n_Kallima_ have arisen from a modification of the nuclei of eye-spots,\r\njust as the dark mould-spots which often occur, frequently develop\r\nin association with the inherited eye-spots; not always however, for\r\nmany such accumulations of black scales occur in spots on which there\r\nhas never been an eye-spot. Thus, too, the 'midribs' of the butterfly\r\nhave in part arisen from a gradual displacing, extending, and altering\r\nof the direction of inherited stripes as, for instance, is clearly\r\nrecognizable in the posterior wing of Fig. 13, but sometimes they are\r\nnew formations. But the veining of a leaf is never found on the wing\r\nof any butterfly of a species which has not the habit of resting among\r\nleaves, or which has not had it at one time, and it never corresponds\r\nto the natural marking of any genus which does not live in forests.\r\nThis impression of leaf-venation has obviously arisen from quite\r\ndifferent patterns of markings, and it has been reached now by one\r\nway, now by another. We can see this from the fact that, in different\r\nbutterflies, it lies in quite different positions on the wing. In\r\nthe _Kallima_ species the stalk of the leaf lies in the tail of the\r\nposterior wing, the tip of the midrib lies near the tip of the wing; in\r\n_Cœnophlebia archidona_ it is exactly reversed, the tip of the anterior\r\nwing (Fig. 14) is prolonged, and forms the stalk, while a broad,\r\ndark, stripe, the midrib (_mr_), runs from there across the middle of\r\nboth wings, and seems to give off two or three lateral ribs running\r\noutwards. If it be asked whether this butterfly always sits down so\r\nartistically that the 'upward turning leaf-stalk is in juxtaposition\r\nto a twig,' we may answer that a bird flying fast is not likely to\r\nlook to see whether every leaf in the profusion of foliage in the\r\nprimitive forests is properly fastened to its stalk or not, any more\r\nthan we should do in the case of a painted bush, on which many a leaf\r\nhas the appearance of floating in the air, just as in nature, or in its\r\nfaithful copy, the photograph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. _Cærois chorinæus_, from the lower Amazon, in\r\nits resting attitude. _V_, anterior wing. _H_, posterior wing. _mr_,\r\nmidrib of the apparent leaf. _sr_, lateral veins. _st_, hint of a\r\nleaf-stalk.]\r\n\r\nQuite different from the leaf-marking either of _Cœnophlebia_ or\r\n_Kallima_ is that of one of the Satyrides of the lower Amazon valley,\r\n_Cærois chorinæus_ (Fig. 15). If one spreads this butterfly out in the\r\nusual way it does not look in the least like a leaf, and one only sees\r\na number of curiously placed disconnected stripes on the under surface\r\nof the wing. But if the wings be folded together to correspond with\r\nthe sitting position of the butterfly, there appears the figure of a\r\nleaf, of which, however, only half is present, and whose midrib (_mr_)\r\nruns obliquely forward from the inner angle of the posterior wing.\r\nHere, again, it is not difficult to guess that this straight stripe has\r\narisen, by displacement and straightening, from a curved line inherited\r\nfrom some remote ancestor, and it is these precise changes which are\r\nthe work of the adaptive processes of natural selection. The same\r\napplies to the lateral ribs (_sr_), which are here four in number.\r\n\r\nBut even the division of the wing surface by a single dark line, such\r\nas that which crosses the middle of the posterior wing of _Hebomoja_\r\n(Fig. 9), an Indian butterfly, heightens not inconsiderably the\r\nresemblance of the resting butterfly to a leaf, a resemblance which\r\nhas already been shown in the form and colour. Indeed, even the sharp\r\ndivision of the wing surface into a darker inner and a lighter outer\r\nportion, which occurs in many species of _Anæa_, gives a very vivid\r\nimpression of a leaf crossed by a midrib.\r\n\r\nIt is not without a purpose that I have lingered so long over the\r\nleaf-butterflies. I wished to make it clear that we have by no means\r\nto do with a few exceptional cases, but with a great number, in all\r\nof which resemblance to a leaf has been aimed at, although it has\r\nbeen attained in varying degrees, and by very diverse ways. Whoever\r\nsurveys this wealth of fact must certainly receive the impression,\r\nthat, wherever it was advantageous to the existence of the species, the\r\nevolution of such a deceptive resemblance has also been possible. In\r\nany case one cannot but be convinced that it is not a case of chance\r\nresemblance, as some naturalists have recently tried to maintain.\r\n\r\nBut I have not yet quite finished my outline-survey of the facts, for I\r\nmust not omit to mention that, in the evergreen tropical forests, there\r\nare also large nocturnal Lepidoptera, which mimic leaves, sometimes\r\ngreen ones, sometimes brown, dead ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. _Phyllodes ornata_, from Assam. Upper surface\r\nwith leaf-like marking only on the anterior wing, which is the only\r\npart visible when at rest; ⅔ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nFig. 16 gives a good picture, reduced to two-thirds, of such a species,\r\n_Phyllodes ornata_, from Assam. The posterior wings are conspicuously\r\ncoloured in deep black and yellow; in the resting position they are\r\ncovered by the anterior wings, and these are red-brown with black\r\nmarkings which precisely and clearly mimic the ribs of a leaf. The\r\nmidrib begins near the tip of the anterior wing, but breaks off\r\nhalf-way across the wing at two silvery white spots, similar to those\r\nin many of the diurnal forms, which also mimic decaying leaves. Three\r\npairs of side veins go off backwards and forwards with remarkable\r\nregularity from the midrib, almost at the same angle, and parallel\r\nto one another, and three more are indicated by vague shading. Then\r\nthe midrib begins again in the internal half of the wing, though only\r\nrepresented by a broad shading. The whole suggests two torn, rotten\r\nleaves, one partly covering the other; and the deception will certainly\r\nbe perfect when the moth rests on the ground or among decaying leaves.\r\n\r\nThat all these extremely favourable protective colorations find their\r\nexplanation in the slow and gradually cumulative effects of natural\r\nselection cannot be disputed; it is beyond doubt that they cannot be\r\nexplained, so far as we know, in any other way.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it were possible for a species of butterfly living in\r\nthe forest and among leaves to become, through natural selection,\r\nin any degree, and in a continually increasing degree, like a leaf,\r\nsurely many insects living in the woods, and especially in the\r\ntropical woods, would also have followed such an advantageous path of\r\nvariation--at least, so we should be inclined to think. And this is\r\nindeed the case; numerous insects, of different orders, if they are\r\nas large as a leaf, have taken on the colour, form, and usually also\r\nthe markings, of a leaf. Thus green and also decaying and dead leaves\r\nare most realistically imitated by many tropical Locustidæ. Besides\r\n_Tropidoderus_, figured on p. 79, a _Pterochroa_ of South Brazil\r\naffords a particularly fine illustration of this, for not only does\r\nthe ground-colour, brown or green, harmonize with that of a dead or\r\nfresh leaf, but, at the same time, all sorts of details are marked on\r\nthe insect, which help to heighten the deceptive impression. Even the\r\noutline of the wings is leaf-like, and leaf-veins are marked on the\r\nwing-covers with the most beautiful distinctness, and finally there\r\nis, especially in the light-green individuals, a spot at the wing tip\r\nwhich, by means of a mixture of brown, yellow, reddish, and violet\r\ncolour-tones, mimics a decaying spot with astonishing fidelity. Here,\r\nagain, the origin of this special adaptation can be clearly recognized,\r\nfor the vaguely concentric arrangement of the colours indicates\r\nthat, in the ancestors of the species, an eye-spot had occurred on\r\nthis area, of the same kind as we still see on the posterior wing,\r\nwhich is covered in the resting position. Thus we can again look\r\nback on the history of the species and conclude that the dissolution\r\nand degeneration of the eye-spot began at the time when the leaf\r\nresemblance was evolved, and this was probably caused by some change of\r\nhabitat, which we can now no longer guess at.\r\n\r\nMany species of leaf-like Orthoptera, both in the Old and New World,\r\nhave tough, green, parchment-like wing-covers which bear a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the thick Magnolia-like leaves of tropical plants. Along\r\nwith these we must also mention the 'walking leaf,' which has been well\r\nknown for centuries. In its case, not the wing-covers alone, but the\r\nhead and thorax, and even the legs, are of the colour and shape of a\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\nThe stick-insects, too, must not remain unnoticed; those quaint\r\ninhabitants of warm countries, whose elongated brown body looks like a\r\nknotted twig, and whose long legs, likewise stick-like, are stretched\r\nout irregularly at different angles to the body, and usually remain\r\nmotionless when the insect is resting. These creatures are vegetarian,\r\nand generally keep so still, that even the naturalist who is on the\r\nlook-out for them may easily overlook them. Even such an experienced\r\nstudent of insects as Alfred Russel Wallace was deceived, for a native\r\nof the Phillipines once brought him a specimen as a 'walking-stick'\r\ninsect, which he rejected, saying that this time it was no animal\r\nbut really a twig, until the native showed him that it was an insect\r\nwhose likeness to a twig was increased by the fact that it bore on\r\nits back a ragged green growth, which looked exactly like a liverwort\r\n(_Jungermannia_), which occurs on the twigs of the trees in that region.\r\n\r\nWe must also notice here the thorn-bugs, which are numerous on the\r\nprickly shrubs of tropical deserts and plateaux, especially in Mexico.\r\nThese bear on the relatively very small body two or three large spines,\r\nwhich make them look like a part of the thorny bush on which they sit.\r\nBut this masking by mimicry of thorns is not confined to insects, it is\r\nseen in lizards as well, notably in _Moloch horridus_, a lizard that\r\nlives in the Australian bush, and is covered all over with thorn-like\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThese examples should be enough to show that mimicry of the usual\r\nsurroundings on the part of animals which are in need of protection,\r\nor are wont to lurk on the watch for their prey, are not isolated\r\nexceptions, chance resemblances, or, as they used to be called, 'freaks\r\nof nature,' but that, on the contrary, they are the rule, depending on\r\nnatural causes, and always occurring when these causes are operative.\r\nThat such protective resemblances seem to be much more frequent in\r\nwarmer climates than with us is probably a fallacy due to the fact that\r\nthe number of species (especially of insects) is very much greater\r\nthere, and that many insect types have their representatives of\r\nconsiderable size of body, which not only makes them more conspicuous\r\n_to us_, but makes some protective device in relation to their enemies\r\nor victims much more necessary.\r\n\r\nBut we must here take account of one more example which occurs in our\r\nfauna in many modifications: the caterpillars of Geometridæ. Many\r\nof these soft and easily injured caterpillars resemble closely, in\r\ncolour and shade, the bark of the tree or shrub on which they live\r\n(Fig. 17). At the same time they have the habit, when at rest, of\r\nstretching themselves out straight and stiff, so that they stand out\r\nfree, at an acute angle from the branch, thus seeming like one of its\r\nlateral twigs. In many species the resemblance is heightened by the\r\nextraordinary pose of the head (_K_) and of the claw-like feet (_F_),\r\nwhich, partly pressed close to the head, partly standing out from it,\r\ngive the anterior end of the caterpillar the appearance of two terminal\r\nbuds, while various little pointed, knotlike warts, scattered over the\r\nbody, represent the sleeping buds of the little twig. Who has not at\r\none time or other taken such a caterpillar for a little branch, and not\r\ninexpert observers only, but even trained naturalists? Many a time I\r\nhave not been able to make quite sure of what I had before me until I\r\ntouched it!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.

R. Wallace and Fritz\r\nMüller have especially contributed.\r\n\r\nWhile the English naturalist, Bates[2], was collecting and observing\r\non the banks of the Amazons--as he did for twelve years--it sometimes\r\noccurred that, among a swarm of those gaily coloured, quaintly shaped\r\nbutterflies, the Heliconiidæ (Pl. II, Fig. 13), he caught one which,\r\non closer examination, proved to be essentially different from its\r\nnumerous companions. It was certainly like them both in colour and\r\nform, but it belonged to quite a different family of butterflies,\r\nthat of the Pieridæ or Whites (Pl. II, Fig. 19). These whites with\r\nthe colours of the Heliconiidæ always occurred singly in swarms of\r\nthe latter form, and Bates found that, in the different districts of\r\nthe Amazon, they always resembled in a striking manner the species of\r\nHeliconiidæ there prevalent. Many of them had been previously known\r\nto entomologists, and because they diverged so far from the usual\r\ntype of the Pieridæ, especially in the form of the wing, the name\r\nDysmorphia, the 'mis-shapen,' had been given to them, although the\r\nmeaning of this 'mis-shapenness' long remained a mystery. The French\r\nLepidopterist, Boisduval, went a step further when he pointed out as\r\nsomething remarkable that nature sometimes makes several species of\r\nquite different families exactly alike, and called attention to three\r\nAfrican butterflies, of which we shall have to speak later in detail.\r\nBut even he was too much fettered by the old views of the immutability\r\nof species to arrive at a correct interpretation. Thus it was reserved\r\nfor Bates to take the decisive step. Observing that the Heliconiidæ\r\noccurred frequently, and usually in large swarms, he concluded\r\nthat they must have few enemies, and as he never saw the numerous\r\ninsectivorous birds and insects hunting them, he further concluded\r\nthat they must have something disagreeable which secured them from the\r\nattacks of these predaceous forms. On the other hand, he found that the\r\nheliconid-like Whites were always rare, and he took this as a sign that\r\nthey were much persecuted, and that they must, therefore, be palatable\r\ntit-bits for the insectivores. If it were possible, then, that a\r\nspecies of Whites with the usual white colour of the family should give\r\nrise to variations, which would make them in any degree resemble the\r\nHeliconiidæ, which are secure from persecution, and if, in addition,\r\nthose that exhibited the profitable variation attached themselves to\r\nswarms of the mimicked form, then these variants would be to a certain\r\nextent secured from attack, and more and more so in proportion as the\r\nresemblance to the protected model increased. The great likeness of\r\nthese Whites to the Heliconiidæ, Bates further argued, would depend on\r\na process of selection, based on the fact that, in each generation,\r\nthose individuals would on the average survive for reproduction\r\nwhich were a little more like the model than the rest, and thus the\r\nresemblance, doubtless slight to begin with, would gradually reach its\r\npresent degree of perfection.\r\n\r\n[2] _Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley_, Trans.\r\nLinn. Soc., Vol. XXIII, 1862.\r\n\r\nBates's hypotheses have been subsequently confirmed in the most\r\nstriking way. The Heliconiidæ do possess a disagreeable taste and\r\nodour, and are utterly rejected by birds, lizards, and other animals.\r\nIt has been directly observed that puff-birds, species of _Trogon_,\r\nand other insectivorous birds, looking down from the tops of trees in\r\nsearch of food, allowed to pass unheeded the swarms of gaily coloured\r\nHeliconiidæ which were fluttering among the leaves, and experiments\r\nwith various insectivorous animals yielded the same result: _the\r\nHeliconiidæ are immune_. We can, therefore, not only understand that\r\nit must be advantageous to resemble them, we can also appreciate many\r\nof their peculiar characters, such as their gay coloration, which must\r\nserve as a sign of their disagreeable taste, and their slow, fluttering\r\nflight, as well as their habit of flocking together, which must make\r\nit easier for the birds to recognize them as uneatable. Everything\r\nwhich marks out these unpalatable morsels, and makes them more readily\r\nrecognizable, must be to their advantage, and therefore must have been\r\nfavoured by natural selection (Pl. II, Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nIn the same way, every increase of resemblance on the part of the\r\nmimics would increase their chances of escaping notice, and any one\r\nwho is accustomed to observe butterflies in nature can well understand\r\nthat even very slight resemblances may have formed the beginning of\r\nthe selection process; perhaps even a mere variation in the manner\r\nof flight, combined with the habit of associating with the swarms of\r\nHeliconiidæ. I myself have many times been momentarily deceived in our\r\nown woods by a White of unusually majestic flight, so that I took it\r\nfor an _Apatura_ or a _Limenitis_. If, therefore, individual Whites\r\noccurred here and there in the Amazon valley, which flew somewhat after\r\nthe manner of the Heliconiidæ, and associated with them, they might\r\npossibly have attained a certain degree of security through that alone,\r\nand it would be greatly increased if at the same time they varied\r\nsomewhat in colour in the direction of their companions.\r\n\r\nIn any case there can be no doubt whatever that in these cases a real\r\ntransformation of the species in colour and marking, and perhaps often,\r\ntoo, in form of wing, has taken place, and that within comparatively\r\nmodern times--let us say during the distribution of a species which\r\nrequired protection over a large continent, or since the last breaking\r\nup of an immune species into local species. Various facts prove this;\r\nabove all, the circumstance that it is often only the females which\r\nexhibit this protective mimicry; and that one and the same species may\r\nmimic a different immune species in different areas, but always the one\r\noccurring abundantly in that area, and so on.\r\n\r\nDefinite examples will make this clearer, and I will only say in\r\nadvance that, since the discovery of Bates, numerous cases of mimicry\r\nin butterflies have been found, not only in South America, but in all\r\ntropical countries which have a rich Lepidopteran fauna. And it is not\r\nonly between the Heliconiidæ and the Pieridæ that such relations have\r\nbeen evolved; many much-persecuted, unprotected species of different\r\nfamilies everywhere mimic species which are rejected on account of\r\ntheir nauseous taste, and these, too, belonging to different families.\r\nThe Heliconiidæ are a purely American group, but in the Old World\r\nand in Australia their place is taken by the three great families of\r\nDanaides, Euplœides, and Acræides, since, as it seems, they all taste\r\nunpleasantly, and are rejected by all, or at least by most, of the\r\ninsectivorous birds. Numerous species of the genus _Danais_ (Pl. I,\r\nFig. 8), _Amauris_ (Pl. I, Fig. 5), _Euplœa_ (Pl. III, Fig. 25, 27),\r\nand _Acræa_ (Pl. II, Fig. 2), and also many species of _Papilio_ and\r\nother genera, enjoy the advantage of unpleasant taste, if not even of\r\npoisonousness; they are, therefore, secure from pursuit, and are, in\r\nconsequence, much mimicked by palatable butterflies.\r\n\r\nAs a further example, I now select a diurnal butterfly from Africa,\r\n_Papilio merope_ Cramer[3], which was shown by Trimen in 1868 to be\r\nmimetic. The species has a wide distribution, for, if we except slight\r\nlocal differences in the marking of the male, its range extends over\r\nthe greater part of Africa, from Abyssinia to the Cape, and from East\r\nAfrica to the Gold Coast.\r\n\r\n[3] The West African form of _Papilio merope_ has been quite recently\r\ndistinguished from the southern form and regarded as a distinct\r\nspecies, the latter being now called _Papilio cenea_. The differences\r\nin the males are very slight--somewhat shorter wings, shorter\r\nwing-tail, and so on--differences which seem relatively unimportant in\r\ncomparison with the differences between the males and the females.\r\n\r\nThe male is a beautiful large butterfly, yellowish white, with a touch\r\nof black, and with little tails to the posterior wings (Pl. I, Fig.\r\n1), like our own swallowtail. A very nearly related species occurs\r\nin Madagascar, and there the female is similarly coloured, though it\r\nmay be distinguished by having a little more black on the wing. On\r\nthe mainland of Africa, however, the females of _Papilio merope_ are\r\nso different in colour and form of wing that it would be difficult to\r\nbelieve them of the same species as the male had not both sexes more\r\nthan once been reared from the eggs of one mother. The females (Pl. I,\r\nFig. 6) in South Africa imitate a species of _Amauris_, _A. echeria_\r\n(Pl. I, Fig. 7), of a dark ground-colour with white, or brownish-white,\r\nmirrors and spots, and they resemble it most deceptively. But what\r\nmakes the case more interesting in its theoretical aspect is that\r\n_Danais echeria_ of Cape Colony is markedly different from _Danais\r\necheria_ of Natal, and the female of _Papilio merope_ has followed\r\nthose two local varieties, and has likewise a Cape and a Natal local\r\nform. Even this is not all, for in Cape Colony there are two other\r\nfemales of _Papilio merope_. One of them has a yellow ground-colour,\r\nand resembles _Danais chrysippus_, which is extremely abundant there\r\n(Pl. I, Fig. 3); the other is entirely different (Pl. I, Fig. 4), for\r\nit closely mimics another Danaid occurring in the same districts of\r\nAfrica, and also immune, _Amauris niavius_ (Pl. I, Fig. 5), not only in\r\nthe beautiful pure white and deep black of the wing surface, but also\r\nin the distribution of these colours to form a pattern.\r\n\r\nWe have thus in Africa four different females of _Papilio merope_,\r\neach of which mimics a protected species of Danaid. They are not\r\nalways locally separate, so that each is exclusively restricted to a\r\nparticular region, for their areas of distribution often overlap, and,\r\nat the Cape for instance, one male form and three different forms of\r\nfemale have been reared from one set of eggs. In addition, we have the\r\nfact that between the two local forms of _Danais echeria_ transition\r\nforms occur, and that the mimetic females of _Papilio merope_ show\r\nthe same transition forms locally, and we must admit that all these\r\nfacts harmonize most beautifully with the selection interpretation,\r\nbut defy any other. And that the last doubt may be dispelled, nature\r\nhas preserved _the primitive female form_ on the continent of\r\nAfrica--namely, in Abyssinia, where, along with the mimetic females,\r\nthere are others which are tailed like the males (Pl. I, Fig. 1), and\r\nare like them in form and colour, a few minor differences excepted.\r\n\r\nThus we have in _Papilio merope_ a species which, in the course of\r\nits distribution through Africa, has scarcely varied at all in the\r\nmale sex, but in the female has almost everywhere lost the outward\r\nappearance of a _Papilio_, and has assumed that of a Danaid, which is\r\nprotected by being unpalatable, and not even everywhere the appearance\r\nof the same species, but in each place that of the prevailing one, and\r\nsometimes of several in one region. These females thus show at the\r\npresent day a polymorphism which consists of four chief mimetic forms,\r\nto which has to be added the primitive form--that resembling the male.\r\nThis has survived in Abyssinia alone, and even there it is not the only\r\none, but occurs along with some of the mimetic forms.\r\n\r\nTo the question why only the females are mimetic in this and other\r\ncases, Darwin and Wallace have answered that the females are more in\r\nneed of protection. In the first place, the males among butterflies\r\nare considerably in the majority, and, secondly, the females must\r\nlive longer in order to be able to lay their eggs. Moreover, the\r\nfemales, which are loaded with numerous eggs, are heavier in flight,\r\nand during the whole period of egg-laying--that is, for a considerable\r\ntime--they are exposed to the attacks of numerous enemies. Whether\r\none of the abundant males is devoured sooner or later is immaterial\r\nto the persistence of the species, since one male is sufficient to\r\nfertilize several females. The death of a single female, on the other\r\nhand, implies a loss of several hundred descendants to the species.\r\nIt is, therefore, intelligible that, in species already somewhat\r\nrare, the female must first of all be protected; that is to say, that\r\nall variations tending in the direction of her protection would give\r\nrise to a process of selection resulting in an augmentation of the\r\nprotective characters.\r\n\r\nBut there are also butterflies in which both sexes mimic a protected\r\nmodel. Thus many imitators of the unpalatable Acræides (Pl. II, Fig.\r\n21) resemble the model in both sexes, and of the South American Whites\r\nwhich mimic the Heliconiidæ there are some which have the appearance\r\nof the Heliconiidæ even in the male sex (Pl. II, Fig. 18, 19), while\r\nothers look like ordinary Whites (for instance, _Archonias potamea_).\r\nBut in many of these species, which are mimetic in the female sex, we\r\nfind also in the male some indications of the mimetic colouring, but\r\nin the first instance only on the under surface. Thus the females of\r\n_Perhybris pyrrha_ (Pl. II, Fig. 17) resemble in their black, yellow,\r\nand orange-red colour-pattern the immune American Danaid, _Lycorea\r\nhalia_ (Pl. II, Fig. 12), but their mates are, on the upper surface,\r\nlike our common Whites, though they already show on the under surface\r\nthe orange-red transverse stripes of the _Lycorea_ (Pl. II, Fig. 16).\r\nIn other mimetic species of Whites a similar beginning is even more\r\nfaintly hinted at, and in others, again, the upper surface of the male\r\nis also provided with protective colours, and only a single white spot\r\non the posterior, or sometimes even on the anterior wing as well, shows\r\nthe original white of the Pieridæ (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\nI do not know how any one can put any other construction on these\r\nfacts than that the females first assumed the protective colouring,\r\nand that the males followed later, and more slowly. Whether this is\r\ndue to inheritance on the female side, and thus ensues as a mechanical\r\nnecessity, in virtue of laws of inheritance still unknown to us, or\r\nwhether it arose because there was a certain advantage in protection\r\nto the males--though not such a marked one--and that these, therefore,\r\nfollowed independently along the same path of evolution as the females,\r\nhas yet to be investigated. Personally, I incline to the latter view,\r\nbecause there are protected mimetic species, in which the female\r\nmimics one immune model, and the male another, quite different from\r\nthe female's. A case in point is that of an Indian butterfly, _Euripus\r\nhaliterses_, and also _Hypolimnas scopas_, in the latter of which\r\nthe male resembles the male of _Euplœa pyrgion_, and the female is\r\nlike the somewhat different female of the same protected species. The\r\nIndian _Papilio paradoxus_, too, seems to show the independence of the\r\nprocesses of mimetic adaptation, for the male is like the blue male\r\nof the immune _Euplœa binotata_ (Pl. III, Fig. 25), while the female\r\nresembles the radially-striped female of _Euplœa midamus_ (Pl. III,\r\nFig. 27), and this double adaptation is repeated in another of the\r\npersecuted butterflies, _Elymnias leucocyma_ (Pl. III, Fig. 26, 28).\r\n\r\nMany objections have been made to the interpretation of mimicry by\r\nselection. It has been asserted that butterflies are exposed to injury\r\nfrom birds only to an inconsiderable extent, not sufficient to account\r\nfor such an intense and persistent process of selection, because they\r\nare not very welcome morsels, on account of the large and uneatable\r\nwings and the relatively small body. Doubt has also been raised as to\r\nthe immunity of the models, which has not been proved in many of the\r\nspecies in regard to which it is assumed. Finally, it is maintained\r\nthat the advantage which resemblance to an immune model brings is\r\nnot proved, but is purely hypothetical; and that it is probable that\r\nthe birds do not distinguish the colours and markings of the flying\r\nbutterflies at all, but are at the most only deceived by resemblances\r\nin their manner of flight.\r\n\r\nThe last objection contains a certain amount of truth, inasmuch as\r\nthe manner of flight always plays a part in the mimicry of a strange\r\nspecies. We shall see later how much the instincts of a species\r\ncontribute to the deception in all cases of protective colouring.\r\nIt is, therefore, not improbable that, in many cases, the imitation\r\nof the flight of an immune species, and a gradually increasing\r\nfamiliarity with the habitats of the same immune species, preceded the\r\nmodification of the colour. Indeed, the slow flight of immune species\r\n(Heliconiidæ) has been unanimously emphasized by observers, as a factor\r\nin facilitating the recognition of the butterflies by the sharp-sighted\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThat it was not only in earlier ages of the world's history that\r\nbutterflies were much persecuted, as some have supposed, but that they\r\nare so still, seems to me indisputable in view of the observations\r\nof the last quarter of a century. Even in this country, where both\r\nbutterflies and insect-eating birds are being more and more crowded out\r\nthrough cultivation, a considerable number of butterflies in flight\r\nfall victims to the birds. Kennel gives observations on this point in\r\nregard to the white-throat; Caspari for the swallows. The latter let\r\nabout a hundred little tortoiseshell butterflies (_Vanessa antiopa_)\r\nfly from his window, 'but not ten of them reached the neighbouring\r\nwood,' all the rest being eaten by swallows, 'which congregated in\r\nnumbers in front of his window.' Kathariner observed, in the highlands\r\nof Asia Minor, a flock of bee-eaters (_Merops_) which caught in flight\r\nand swallowed a great many individuals of a very beautiful diurnal\r\nbutterfly (_Thais cerisyi_).\r\n\r\nFinally, Pastor Slevogt has collected much evidence to show that\r\nour indigenous butterflies have a great deal to suffer in the way\r\nof persecution from birds. And in regard to tropical countries, the\r\nchase of butterflies by insectivorous birds has long been known. Thus\r\nPöppig says that in the primitive forests one can easily recognize\r\nthe place which has been selected by one of the Jacamars (Galbulidæ)\r\nas its favourite resting-place, for the wings of the largest and most\r\nbeautiful butterflies, whose bodies alone are eaten, lie on the ground\r\nin a circle for a distance of several paces. We owe direct observations\r\non the hunting of insects by birds of the primitive forest especially\r\nto Dr. Hahnel, who found many opportunities for observation in the\r\ncourse of his enthusiastic collecting journeys in Central and South\r\nAmerica. He writes: 'No other family of butterflies suffered so much\r\nfrom birds as the Pieridæ (Whites), and these freebooters often snapped\r\naway the prettiest and freshest specimens from quite close to me. Every\r\ntime I was amazed anew at the unfailing security of their flight, and I\r\ngladly paid for the spectacle by the loss of a few specimens.' Of the\r\npursuit of one of the large _Caligo_ species, whose leaf-like under\r\nsurface, marked with eye-spots, I have already described, (Fig. 6, p.\r\n70), he says: 'With incredible skill this fairly large insect avoided\r\nevery blow of the bill of the bird which followed it in close chase,\r\nand saved itself by flying from one shrub to another, till at last it\r\nwas lost to sight in the thickest tangle of branches, and the exhausted\r\nbird gave up further attempts at pursuit.'\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to the birds, the butterflies of the primitive forest\r\nhave to dread the persecution of other insects, especially of the large\r\npredaceous dragon-flies, which throw themselves upon them in the midst\r\nof their flight. Hahnel often saw a specimen of the large, beautiful,\r\nblue _Morpho cisseis_, which was fluttering peacefully about the crown\r\nof a tree, suddenly shoot head downwards, 'like an ox with horns\r\nlowered, and then reascended apparently with difficulty, after it had\r\ntorn itself free from its sudden assailant, whose jaws left distinct\r\nshort scars.'\r\n\r\nIn addition to birds and predatory insects the butterflies are\r\npersecuted by the whole army of lizards. In order to entice the\r\nbutterflies, Hahnel laid bait in the wood, 'sugar-cane, little sweet\r\nbananas, and such like.' Various kinds of butterfly settled on it,\r\n'Satyrides, Ageroniæ, _Adelpha_ and other Nymphalidæ.' He saw that they\r\n'were persistently stalked and attacked by greedy lizards, which, in\r\nspite of their plump figure and uncouth gait, showed themselves able\r\nto spring suddenly out and snatch their prey with great adroitness. It\r\nis, however, very wonderful to see the agility such a persecuted insect\r\ndisplays in evading the repeated attacks of these marauders.' Thus on\r\none occasion an _Adelpha_ was driven off a dozen times from the exposed\r\nbait by a lizard, which pounced upon it, but it always settled down\r\nfor a short time on a leaf, and soon returned to its repast, whereupon\r\nthe enemy 'instantaneously rushed upon it in a fury, until at last he\r\nwas obliged to give in,' abandoning the attempt to catch a creature so\r\nadept in retreat.\r\n\r\nMany butterflies assemble at midday on sandbanks in the middle\r\nof the river, in order to drink, and there, too, the lizards are\r\nalways lurking about. Hahnel gives a pretty and undoubtedly accurate\r\ndescription of the protective value of the long tail borne by many\r\nof the sail-like Papilios at the end of the posterior wing; they\r\n'quite obviously' afford protection against the lizards, 'which, after\r\nsnapping, often find themselves obliged to be content with the tail\r\nalone, while the rest of the animal flies away practically uninjured.'\r\n\r\nNot only is the great persecution of the butterflies a fact, the\r\nimmunity of the known species, which are models for mimicry, is\r\nalso certain. For numerous species, at any rate, this has now been\r\nestablished. First of all--as has already been said--this is true of\r\nthe Heliconiidæ, in regard to which Wallace long ago showed that, if\r\nthe thorax be pressed, they exude a yellowish juice of unpleasant\r\nsmell. This is probably the blood of the insect, but that does not\r\nhinder the repulsive odour of the living butterfly being perceptible at\r\na distance of 'several paces,' as Seitz observed in _Heliconius besei_.\r\n\r\nRepeated experiments have been made, which have shown that such\r\nbutterflies are rejected not only by the insectivorous birds of the\r\nprimitive forest, but also by tame turkeys, pheasants and partridges,\r\nusually so greedy. Hahnel has recently repeated these experiments in\r\nBrazil with hens, and he obtained the same result. The hens, 'which\r\notherwise devoured all butterflies eagerly,' rejected all Ithomidæ,\r\nHeliconiidæ, the white Papilios, as also some of the gaily coloured\r\nHeliconiid-like moths which fly by day, such as _Esthema bicolor_ and\r\n_Pericopis lycorea_. Obviously, the gay or conspicuous colour of these\r\nLepidoptera acts as a warning signal of their unpalatability, and\r\nprotects them from attempts on the part of the birds to investigate\r\ntheir flavour. Hence we find that the under surface of these insects\r\nis coloured like the upper. Even the numbers of these species which\r\nfly about indicates that they must be little decimated, and, in point\r\nof fact, we never find the wings of Heliconiidæ lying on the ground in\r\nthe forests of South America, while those of the Nymphalidæ and other\r\nbutterflies are by no means uncommonly seen as the remains of birds'\r\nmeals.\r\n\r\nThere is just as little room for doubt, as in the case of the\r\nHeliconiidæ and their allies, that the Danaidæ, Acræidæ, and the\r\nEuplœidæ in the tropical regions of the Old World enjoy a certain\r\nimmunity on account of their repulsive odour and taste. Here, too,\r\nobservation and experiment have shown that birds, lizards, and\r\npredaceous insects leave the butterflies of these families unmolested.\r\nI need only mention the observation of Trimen that, under an acacia\r\nmuch visited by butterflies, on which Mantides--the so-called\r\npraying-insects--caught and devoured large numbers, the wings of an\r\n_Acræa_ or a _Danais_ were never found. These unpalatable butterflies\r\nalso possess a motley or at least striking dress, recognizable from\r\nafar, and alike on both surfaces; and they also have a slow flight,\r\nby which they are readily recognized. They, too, usually assemble\r\nin large swarms, and both sexes are alike, or resemble each other\r\nclosely in colouring, or at least they are both equally conspicuous.\r\nBut even these cases do not complete the list of butterflies which are\r\nprotected by their unpalatability; among the otherwise much-persecuted\r\nand therefore palatable Pieridæ (Whites) there is an Asiatic genus,\r\n_Delias_, which in all probability belongs to the immune butterflies,\r\nas their gaily coloured under surface indicates, and among the\r\nnocturnal Lepidoptera of different countries and families there are\r\nisolated generations which are very gaily and conspicuously coloured,\r\nand which are rejected by birds, their unpleasant odour being\r\nperceptible at a distance of several feet (Chalcosiidæ and Eusemiidæ).\r\nThe latter no longer fly under cover of night, like their relatives,\r\nbut have assumed diurnal habits.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that the repulsiveness of such 'unpalatable'\r\nbutterflies is associated with the food-plant on which the caterpillar\r\nlives. Acrid, nauseous, astringent, and actually poisonous substances\r\nare produced in many plants, and we shall see later that this is to\r\ntheir own advantage; these substances pass into the insect, and they\r\ndo so probably in part unaltered, in part certainly altered, but still\r\nthey are protective, perhaps even in an increased degree. This is\r\nborne out by the fact that many caterpillars of immune butterflies\r\nlive on more or less poisonous plants: the Acræidæ and Heliconiidæ on\r\nPassiflores, which contain nauseous substances; the Danaidæ on the\r\npoisonous Asclepiadæ, which are rich in milky juice or latex; the\r\nEuplœæ on the poisonous species of _Ficus_, the Neotropinæ on the\r\nSolanaceæ, and so on. But there are many genera, rich in species,\r\nand distributed over the whole earth, the caterpillars of which live\r\non plants of very various families and characters, and of these the\r\nmajority of species are palatable, though a few are repulsive in\r\ntaste and odour, and therefore immune. This is the case in the genus\r\n_Papilio_. As far back as the sixties Wallace discovered that there\r\nwere immune species of _Papilio_, and that these were mimicked\r\nby other species. Later it was shown that these immune species\r\nlive chiefly on poisonous plants (in the wide sense), on various\r\nAristolochiæ; and Haase has recently grouped these together as\r\npoison-eaters (Aristolochia-butterflies or Pharmacophagæ). They are\r\ndistinguished by a conspicuous red on the body. In some of them, as in\r\n_Papilio philoxenus_, a repulsive odour as of decomposing urine has\r\nbeen detected in the living animal.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the much-persecuted and easily injured butterflies\r\nmake use of a poisonous substance (in the widest sense), prepared in\r\nthe plant for its own protection, and, wherever their own metabolism\r\nmakes it possible, they use it to protect themselves. We need not\r\nwonder, therefore, that so many butterflies are immune, nor that among\r\nthe numerous palatable species a small proportion have endeavoured to\r\nbecome like the protected species, as far as natural selection was able\r\nto bring such a resemblance about.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any adaptation phenomenon so widely distributed and\r\ndiverse in its manifestations, which has been at the same time so much\r\nobserved and followed out into all its details, as Mimicry; and it must\r\nsurely be regarded as a justification of the validity of interpreting\r\nit in terms of Natural Selection that all the observed phenomena tally\r\nso beautifully with the deductions from the theory. I at least know of\r\nno facts which contradict the theory, but of many which might have been\r\npredicted from it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it might have been predicted from the theory alone that\r\nan immune species would often have several mimics, as, in point of\r\nfact, is frequently the case, and it would be easy to give numerous\r\nexamples of this. Thus the two Danaids of South and Central Africa,\r\n_Amauris echeria_ and _Amauris niavius_, are mimicked, not only\r\nby the two female forms of _Papilio merope_, as we have already\r\ndescribed in detail, but the latter is also mimicked by Nymphalid,\r\nwhich requires protection, _Diadema anthedon_, and the former by two\r\ndiurnal butterflies of different families, _Diadema nuina_ and _Papilio\r\necherioides_.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the black-and-red coloured _Heliconius melpomene_ in Brazil\r\nis mimicked both by the female of a White (_Archonias teuthamis_),\r\nand by a _Papilio_, which has received the name of _P. euterpinus_ on\r\naccount of this resemblance. Thus, too, the immune _Methona psidii_,\r\nCr. of Brazil, with its half-transparent wings marked with black bands,\r\nhas five mimics, belonging to five different genera, and one of these\r\nis not a true diurnal butterfly at all, but one of the day-flying\r\nspecies of the genus _Castnia_, whose systematic position is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Upper surfaces of _A_, _Acræa egina_, from the\r\nGold Coast, immune. _B_, _Papilio ridleyanus_, from Gaboon, not immune.\r\n_C_, _Pseudacræa boisduvalii_, from the Gold Coast, not immune.]\r\n\r\nThe West African immune Acræid, _Acræa gea_ (Pl. II, Fig. 21), is\r\ndeceptively mimicked, both as to the narrow, long shape of the wing\r\nand its blackish-brown and white mottled markings, by a Nymphalid,\r\n_Pseudacræa hirce_, by the female of a Papilio (_P. cynorta_) whose\r\nmate is quite different, and by the female of a Satyrid (_Elymnias\r\nphegea_) (Pl. II, Fig. 20). In the _Papilio_ the resemblance extends to\r\nthe peculiar pitch-black shining spot on the under side of the base of\r\nthe posterior wing, and all three are like the model on both surfaces,\r\nand therefore in flight as well as in the resting attitude.\r\n\r\nOn the same West African coast occurs the strange greyish-black _Acræa\r\negina_, with brick-red spots and bands, and coal-black dots (Fig. 18,\r\n_A_). This immune species is deceptively mimicked in its native country\r\nby two other butterflies--a Nymphalid, _Pseudacræa boisduvalii_ (Fig.\r\n18, _C_), and by a female _Papilio_ (_P. ridleyanus_) (Fig. 18, _B_),\r\nby the latter not so exactly as by the former, but quite sufficiently\r\nto be confused with its model in flight.\r\n\r\nIt would have been less easy to predict with certainty from the theory\r\nthat, conversely, the different species of a genus which stood in need\r\nof protection would be able to mimic quite different immune models, for\r\nwho would have ventured to prophesy how far the capacity of a species\r\nfor variation might go, and how many different kinds of coloration it\r\nwas able to assume? But the facts teach us that there is a wide range\r\nof possibility in this respect.\r\n\r\nMost interesting in this respect is, perhaps, the Asiatic-African\r\ngenus _Elymnias_, a Satyrid whose numerous (over thirty) species\r\nall seem to be in need of protection, for many of them mimic immune\r\nbutterflies, while the rest are inconspicuous and are provided with\r\nprotective colouring on the under surface. On Plates II and III some\r\nof the former are depicted beside their models. The single African\r\nspecies (_Elymnias phegea_) (Pl. II, Fig. 20) mimics, as has been\r\nalready mentioned, the prevalent _Acræa gea_ (Pl. II, Fig. 21). Many\r\nof the Asiatic Elymniidæ are mimics of the immune Euplœæ, especially\r\nthe dark-brown species with steel-blue shimmer, such as _E. patna_ in\r\nIndia, _E. beza_ in Borneo, and _E. penanga_ in Borneo. In Amboina\r\nthere flies an _E. vitellia_, the female of which mimics accurately the\r\nplain, light-brown, inconspicuous _Euplœa climena_ which occurs there.\r\nThe male of _Elymnias leucocyma_ (Pl. III, Fig. 26) resembles the brown\r\nand blue shimmering _Euplœa binotata_ (Pl. III, Fig. 25), while the\r\nfemale mimics the dusky, radially-striped female of _Euplœa midamus_\r\n(Pl. III, Figs. 27 and 28): the male of _Elymnias cassiphone_ resembles\r\nthe blackish-brown and deep-blue iridescent _Euplœa claudia_, while the\r\nfemale is like the female of _Euplœa midamus_. A number of species of\r\n_Elymnias_ copy Danaids: thus both sexes of _E. lais_ are like _Danais\r\nvulgaris_ (Pl. III, Figs. 29 and 30), and _E. ceryx_ and _E. timandra_\r\nare like another similar Danaid, _D. tytia_. The female only of _E.\r\nundularis_ of Ceylon mimics the brown-yellow _D. genutia_ (Pl. II, Fig.\r\n22) in general appearance, though not minutely, while the male (Pl.\r\nII, Fig. 24) seems to attempt an imitation of the blue Euplœæ. A rare\r\nform, not often represented in collections, _Elymnias künstleri_, bears\r\na striking resemblance to the Danaid, _Ideopsis daos_ Boisd., with its\r\nwhite wings spotted with black, while three species mimic the probably\r\nimmune Pierid genus _Delias_, especially on the under surface, which\r\nis decorated with yellow and red. Perhaps the one which has diverged\r\nfarthest from the original type is _Elymnias agondas_ Boisd. (Pl. II,\r\nFig. 32) of the Papua region and the island of Waigeu, for it bears\r\ntwo large blue eye-spots on the posterior wings, and thus, especially\r\nin the case of the almost white female, closely resembles _Tenaris\r\nbioculatus_ (Pl. III, Fig. 31). There are thus seven or eight types\r\nof marking and colouring differing from one another, and belonging to\r\nsix different genera and a much greater number of species, which are\r\nmimicked by this one genus _Elymnias_.\r\n\r\nIt is most interesting to note how these mimetic species give up, more\r\nor less, the original sympathetic colouring of the under surface,\r\nand use in establishing their mimicry the marking elements which\r\nwere originally directed towards concealment. According to the\r\nbeautiful observations of Erich Haase on this genus _Elymnias_, the\r\nground-colouring on the under surface must have been 'a grey, darkly\r\nmottled protective one,' as still occurs, for instance, in several\r\nmimetic species, such as _Elymnias lais_ (Pl. III, Fig. 30). This\r\nleaf-colouring disappears more and more the more perfect the mimicry of\r\nthe model becomes, until, finally, the model is repeated on the under\r\nsurface also. Compare, for instance, Figs. 30 and 32. From this we\r\nmay conclude that a dress which makes Lepidoptera appear unpalatable\r\nmorsels is a more effective protection than resemblance to a leaf. That\r\nmight indeed be deduced even from the theory, for resemblance to a leaf\r\nnever protects _absolutely_, and does so, in any case, only during\r\nrest, while apparent unpalatability repels assailants at all times.\r\n\r\nThose unversed in butterfly lore usually ask, when these mimetic\r\nrelations are expounded to them, how we know that copies which are\r\nso like their models really belong to a different genus, or even\r\nfamily. There are certainly cases in which model and copy resemble\r\neach other so closely that even a zoologist cannot tell one from the\r\nother without close examination, as, for instance, in the case of\r\ncertain transparent-winged Heliconiidæ of Brazil (Ithomiides) and their\r\nmimics belonging to the family of Whites. But even in such cases the\r\nlikeness only extends as far as is theoretically requisite, that is,\r\nonly to those characters that make the butterfly appear to the eye of\r\nits pursuer like another species, known to it to be unpalatable. The\r\nlikeness does not extend to details, which can only be seen with a\r\nmagnifying-glass or a microscope, and above all, it does not extend\r\nto the caterpillar, pupa, or egg. Thus, in the case cited, we may be\r\ncertain that the caterpillar of _Ithomia_ is quite different from\r\nthat of the mimicking White, since the former will be, in structure,\r\nof the type of _Ithomia_ caterpillar, and the other of the usual type\r\nof Whites. As yet, indeed, these two species are not known in their\r\ncaterpillar stages, but other cases are known. A species belonging to\r\nthe same genus as our indigenous 'kingfishers' (_Limenitis populi_), a\r\ndiurnal butterfly of North America, _Limenitis archippus_ (Pl. I, Fig.\r\n9), strongly resembles the brown-yellow, immune _Danais erippus_ (Pl.\r\nI, Fig. 8), while the caterpillars of both species are quite different,\r\nthat of _Danais erippus_ possessing the remarkable, soft and flexible\r\nhorn-like processes of the Danaid caterpillars (Pl. I, Fig. 10_a_),\r\nwhile the caterpillar of _Limenitis archippus_ (Pl. I, Fig. 11_a_) is\r\nat once recognizable by its blunt, club-shaped and spinose papillæ\r\nas a _Limenitis_ caterpillar. The adaptation of the butterfly to its\r\nprotected model has thus exercised no influence upon the caterpillar.\r\nNor has it affected the pupa, which in both cases exhibits the very\r\ndifferent and quite characteristic form of the _Danais_ pupa and the\r\n_Limenitis_ pupa respectively (Pl. I, Fig. 10_b_, and 11_b_).\r\n\r\nBut even in the butterfly itself nothing is altered, except what\r\nincreases the resemblance to the model. All else has remained\r\nunchanged, above all, the venation of the wings. Since the painstaking\r\nand valuable work of Herrich-Schäfer the venation has been made the\r\nbasis of the whole systematic arrangement of butterflies, and it\r\nenables us, in point of fact, to distinguish with precision, not the\r\nfamilies alone, but often even the genera, for the course of the\r\nveins in the different species of a single genus is the same, and\r\nthat is true for the mimetic species as well as for others. Thus the\r\nDanaid-like _Limenitis_ has the usual _Limenitis_ venation, of the kind\r\nseen in our own indigenous species of _Limenitis_, and the already\r\ndescribed _Elymnias_ species of the African and Indian forests and\r\ngrassy plains have always the venation characteristic of this genus,\r\nwhether they be protected only by sympathetic colouring or imitate\r\nan immune _Euplœa_, a _Danais_, an _Acræa_, or a _Tenaris_. However\r\nmuch the contour of the wing may vary, the venation is unaffected,\r\nand we can distinguish model from copy by this means alone, so that,\r\neven when there is the closest resemblance, no doubt is possible.\r\nIn its theoretical aspect this constancy of venation is obviously\r\nimportant, for as nothing about the organism is incapable of variation,\r\nthe veining of the wings might have varied, as indeed it has varied\r\nfrom genus to genus in the course of the phylogenetic history; but as\r\nchanges in venation could not be detected by the butterflies' enemies,\r\nhowever sharp-sighted, there has been no reason in these cases for\r\nvariation in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion Poulton has brought forward interesting facts showing\r\nthat the mimics of one model, belonging to different genera, often\r\nsecure the same effect in quite different ways. Thus the glass-like\r\ntransparency of the wings in the Heliconiidæ of the genus _Methona_\r\ndepends on a considerable reduction of the size of the scales, which\r\nordinarily cover both sides of the wing as thickly as the tiles on a\r\nroof, and produce the colour. In another quite similar species, also\r\ntransparent-winged, the Danaid _Ituna ilione_, the transparency is due\r\nto the absence of most of the scales, and in a third mimic, _Castnia\r\nlinus_, var. _heliconoides_, the scales are not altered either in size\r\nor number, but have become absolutely unpigmented and transparent.\r\nIn a fourth mimic, a Pierid, _Dismorphia crise_, the scales have not\r\ndecreased in number, but have become quite minute, while in a fifth\r\ncase, the nocturnal _Hyelosia heliconoides_ Swains., the same thing\r\nhas happened as in _Castnia_, but the scales are also fewer in number.\r\nThus in each of the mimics the changes which have taken place in the\r\nscales are quite different, but they bring about the same effect, the\r\nglass-like transparency of the wings, on which the resemblance to the\r\nmodel depends: what we have before us is, therefore, not a similarity\r\nof variation, but only an appearance of similarity in external features.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such facts there can be no further question of the often\r\nrepeated objection, that the resemblance of model and copy depend on\r\nthe similarity of external influences upon species living in the same\r\nlatitude, even if that were not already sufficiently refuted by the\r\nfrequent restriction of the mimicry to the female. And that mimicry\r\nshould be a mere matter of chance is negatived even by the single\r\nfact that model and copy always live in the same area, and that the\r\nlocal varieties of the model are faithfully followed by the mimic.\r\nAn interesting example of this is furnished by _Elymnias undularis_,\r\nalready mentioned, for in this case the female (Pl. II, Fig. 23)\r\nmimics the brown-yellow _Danais plexippus_ (Pl. II, Fig. 22), not\r\nwherever _E. undularis_ occurs, but only in Ceylon and British India.\r\nIn Burmah, where another Danaid, _D. hegesippus_, is common, it mimics\r\nthat; and in Malacca it does not copy a Danaid at all, but resembles\r\nthe male of its own species, which in India is very different from\r\nit, since there the female mimics one of the blue iridescent Euplœæ\r\n(Pl. III, Fig. 24). It cannot therefore be a matter of 'chance,' and\r\nwe should have to give up all attempt at a scientific interpretation\r\nif we were not prepared to accept that of natural selection. Even the\r\ninterference of a purposeful Power can hardly be seriously considered\r\nin this case, even by those who are inclined to such a view, for the\r\n_gradual_ approximation to the model, which is a matter of course in a\r\nprocess of evolution, could only appear, if referred to the benevolent\r\nintelligence of a Creator, as an unworthy trick, designed to lead\r\nhumanity astray in its strivings after knowledge. On the other hand,\r\nthis gradual increase of resemblance, which becomes apparent when we\r\ncompare several mimetic species--this carrying over, step by step,\r\nfrom the female to the male--and many other facts point to the working\r\nof natural forces according to law, and, if there is to be found\r\nanywhere in living nature a complicated process of self-regulation,\r\nit certainly lies before us here, clearer and less open to objections\r\nthan almost anywhere else. I do not mean to say, however, that we\r\ncan verify it statistically in detail, as has been demanded by the\r\nfanatical opponents of natural selection. A direct testing of natural\r\nselection is, as has been already shown, nowhere possible: we can never\r\nexactly estimate how great the advantage is which a species requiring\r\nprotection derives from a slight increase in the resemblance to an\r\nimmune model; and I for one do not know how we could even definitely\r\nprove that a certain species needed a greater degree of protection than\r\nit had previously enjoyed in order to ensure its persistence in the\r\nstruggle. It would be necessary to know the total number of individuals\r\nliving on a certain area for many generations. If it appeared that\r\nthere was a progressive diminution in the number of individuals, we\r\nshould be justified in concluding that the species had not an adequate\r\npower of persistence, and that it therefore required a more effective\r\nprotection. But it is impossible for us to collect such exact data\r\nfor any species living under natural conditions, although we can\r\noften say approximately that a species is progressively decreasing in\r\nnumbers. Even this, however, we can usually do only in cases which\r\nare influenced directly or indirectly by the interference of Man in\r\nnature, and in which the falling off in the species occurs so rapidly\r\nthat there is no time for the slow counteractive influence of natural\r\nselection. We shall see later that in this way many species have been\r\neliminated even within historic times.\r\n\r\nI have just spoken of the 'need of protection,' and I have a few\r\nremarks to add on that subject. It is a mistake to believe that every\r\n'rare' species, that is, one represented by few individuals, is\r\nalready in process of disappearing. It is not the absolute number of\r\nindividuals that determines the survival of a species, but the fact\r\nof the number remaining the same. It is equally mistaken to suppose\r\nthat an amelioration of the conditions of existence for any species\r\nby natural selection is possible only when its persistence is already\r\nthreatened; that is, when the number of individuals (the 'normal\r\nnumber') is steadily decreasing. On the contrary, it is of the essence\r\nof natural selection that every favourable variation which crops up is,\r\n_ceteris paribus_, preserved, and becomes the common possession of the\r\nspecies, quite independently of whether this improvement is absolutely\r\nnecessary to its preservation or not. In the latter case it will simply\r\nbecome a commoner species instead of a rare one; and every species\r\nis, so to speak, striving to become common and widely distributed,\r\nsince every advantageous variation that can possibly be produced is\r\naccumulated and made the common property of the species. But this has\r\nits limits, not only in the constitution and the structure of each\r\nspecies, but also in the external conditions of its life. If a species\r\nof butterfly be restricted, in the caterpillar stage, to a single, rare\r\nspecies of plant, its normal number will be, and must remain, a small\r\none. But if there arise within it a variation in the food-instinct\r\nwhereby a second and it may be a commoner plant becomes available, then\r\nthe normal number of the species will rise, and perhaps the original\r\nnumber of individuals may be more than doubled. It is, however, by no\r\nmeans necessary to assume that the species was previously in process of\r\ndecadence; on the contrary its normal number may have remained quite\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nSo, in the case of the mimetic butterflies, we do not need to assume\r\nthat they all previously required protection in the sense that they\r\nwould have become extinct had they not assumed a likeness to an\r\nimmune species. We may indeed conclude, on other grounds, that it\r\nwas the rarer species which increased their number of individuals\r\nby the mimetic protection, and in doing so they certainly enhanced\r\nat the same time their chance of survival as a species. In the more\r\nabundant species mimetic resemblance to species whose unpalatability\r\nrendered them immune could not have been evolved, as it would have been\r\ndisadvantageous, not only for the model, but for the mimicking species\r\nitself, while in species less rich in individuals, such resemblance\r\nwould necessarily have a protective value, no matter whether the\r\nspecies was in danger of extinction or not. The process of selection\r\nmust have started simply because the mimetic individuals survived more\r\nfrequently than the others, and the mimetic resemblance must have\r\ngone on increasing as long as the increase brought with it a more\r\neffective protection. It is, therefore, a fallacious objection to say\r\nthat a species, whose existence was threatened, would, considering the\r\nslowness of the process of selection, have died out altogether before\r\nit could have acquired effective protection by mimicking an immune\r\nspecies. The assumption is false--the widespread, hazy idea that the\r\nprocess of natural selection can only begin when the existence of the\r\nspecies is threatened. On the contrary, every species utilizes every\r\npossibility of improvement; and every improvement for which variation\r\nsupplies the necessary material is possible. The augmentation of the\r\nprofitable variations follows as a necessity from the more frequent\r\nsurvival of the best-adapted individuals, and this 'more frequent\r\nsurvival' will be not only a relative one, due to the fact that the\r\nbetter adapted individuals will be less decimated, it will also be\r\nabsolute, because more individuals of the species will survive than\r\nbefore. Of this _Papilio merope_ may serve as an example; in Madagascar\r\nit now flies about only slightly varied from the original form, var.\r\n_meriones_. Here, therefore, the species is maintained, without the aid\r\nof mimetic protection. We do not know if the reason for this lies in\r\nthe absence of an immune model, or in the non-appearance of suitable\r\nmimetic variants, or in other conditions; but we know that without\r\nmimicry the species holds its own against its enemies. But if, in\r\nAbyssinia, a female of this butterfly exhibited variations which would\r\nmake her resemble, in any degree, the unpalatable _Danias chrysippus_,\r\nthese mimetic variants would be less decimated than the original form\r\nof female, and would, therefore, gain stability, and gradually increase\r\nboth in mimetic resemblance and in the number of individuals. But is\r\nthis any reason why the original form of the female should diminish\r\nin numbers? In itself, certainly not; the red mimetic females could\r\nincrease in number without causing any decrease of the yellow ones,\r\nfor the red are in no way in conflict with the yellow, and we must not\r\nthink of the number of individuals as so fixed for each species that it\r\ncannot increase. On the contrary, it _must_ increase, as soon as the\r\nconditions of existence are permanently improved, and this happens, in\r\nthis case, through the mimetic protection of the red female. We can\r\nthus easily understand how mimetic and non-mimetic females can live\r\nside by side in Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nIn all the rest of Africa, however, there are only mimetic females\r\nof _Papilio merope_, and none of the colour of the male; these last,\r\ntherefore, have been crowded out by the mimetic form, not actively, but\r\nthrough the more frequent survival of the mimetic form, so that those\r\nlike the male became gradually rarer, and finally died out--that is,\r\nceased to occur. The matter is not so simple as it seems, and we shall\r\nbest understand it by thinking of the dimorphism of the caterpillars\r\nof our hawk-moths, which we discussed before, in which the green form\r\nin the full-grown caterpillar is less well protected than the brown.\r\nIn many species the brown form has crowded out the green, in others\r\nbrown and green occur side by side, but the green is less abundant, and\r\nin some species very rare. This must be regarded as the simple result\r\nof the circumstance that a higher percentage of the green than of the\r\nbrown caterpillars fall victims to enemies, and thus, in the course of\r\ngenerations, the green form becomes slowly but steadily rarer. This\r\nwill be the case even if the newer and better adaptation raises the\r\nnumber of individuals (the 'normal number') in the species, for this\r\nincrease must always be a limited one, even if it be very great, which\r\nis hardly likely in this case. For the normal number is not determined\r\nby the mortality at one stage, but by that at all the stages of life\r\ntaken together. Thus a normal number always persists, notwithstanding\r\nthe improved conditions for the species, and, on this assumption, the\r\nform under less favourable conditions cannot permanently hold its own\r\nwith that under better conditions, but must gradually disappear. We\r\ncan understand, then, that the primitive form of the _Papilio merope_\r\nfemale may persist even for a long time side by side with the mimetic\r\nform in certain habitats. It is, probably, not a mere chance, that\r\nthis should have happened just in Abyssinia, for, in that region, the\r\nmimetic female is still tailed--that is, she has not yet reached the\r\nhighest degree of resemblance to her immune model. In the whole of the\r\nrest of Africa the process of the transformation of the female has\r\nalready reached its highest point, and on the east and west coasts,\r\nas well as in South Africa, the primitive form of the species is now\r\nrepresented only by the male.\r\n\r\nThe gradual dying out of the less favourably conditioned forms of a\r\nspecies is a law which follows as a logical necessity from the essence\r\nof the process of selection, but its reality may be inferred from the\r\nphenomena themselves. On it depends, as far at least as adaptations are\r\nconcerned, the transformation of species.\r\n\r\nA beautiful example of the crowding out of a less favoured form of a\r\nspecies by a more favoured one is afforded by a butterfly of North\r\nAmerica, of which the two female forms have long been known, although\r\nthe reason for their dimorphism was not understood. A yellow butterfly,\r\n_Papilio turnus_, not unlike our swallow-tail, has yellow females in\r\nthe north and east of the United States, but black ones in the south\r\nand west. There was much guessing as to what the cause of this striking\r\nphenomenon might be, and it was for a time thought that this difference\r\nwas directly due to the influence of climate, and, later, the black\r\nform of female was regarded as protectively coloured, because of the\r\nsupposed greater persecution by birds in the south, since the female\r\nwould be less easily recognized if of a dark colour, and would thus be\r\nbetter protected. This last explanation could hardly be looked upon as\r\nsatisfactory, for a black butterfly in flight would be very easily seen\r\nby sharp-sighted birds; indeed, against a light background, it would be\r\neven more readily seen than a light one.\r\n\r\nSince we have acquired a more exact knowledge of the immune species\r\nof _Papilio_ this case has become clear to us. For on those stretches\r\nof country on which the black female of _Papilio turnus_ lives there\r\noccurs another _Papilio_ which is black in both sexes, _Papilio\r\nphilenor_, and this is one of those species which are protected by\r\ntheir unpleasant taste and odour. Here, therefore, we have a case of\r\nmimicry, the female of _Papilio turnus_ imitates the immune _Papilio\r\nphilenor_, and thereby secures protection for itself; but as the immune\r\nmodel only occurs in the southern half of the distribution of _Papilio\r\nturnus_ a somewhat sharp separation of the two forms of female\r\nhas been evolved; the black, mimetic form, being the most fit, has\r\ncompletely crowded the primitive yellow form out of the area inhabited\r\nby _Papilio philenor_, while beyond this area, to the north and west,\r\nthe yellow form alone prevails. The extensive and careful studies of\r\nEdwards have shown that the two forms occur together only in a very\r\nnarrow transition region.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the facts, wherever we scrutinize them carefully,\r\nharmonize with the theory. Of course we can only penetrate to a\r\ncertain depth with the theory of selection, and we are still far from\r\nhaving reached the fundamental causes of the phenomena. Indeed, our\r\nunderstanding must in the meantime stop short before the causes of\r\nvariations and their accumulation, but up to that point the theory\r\ngives us clearness, and discloses the causal connexion of phenomena\r\nin the most beautiful way. Although we do not yet understand how the\r\nsouthern female _Papilio turnus_ was able to produce the advantageous\r\nblack, we do see why a black variation, when it did occur, should\r\nincrease and be strengthened, until it crowded out the yellow form from\r\nthe area of the immune model, and we are able in a general way to refer\r\nthe whole complicated phenomena of mimicry to their proximate causes.\r\n\r\nThis is true also of other phenomena which have had no part in\r\nestablishing the theory, since attention was only directed to them\r\nlater, and it is true even of some which, at first sight, seem to\r\ncontradict the theory altogether. To this class belongs, for instance,\r\nthe phenomenon that immune species not unfrequently mimic each other,\r\nas was first observed among the Heliconiid-like butterflies of South\r\nAmerica. In four different families, the Danaidæ, the Neotropidæ, the\r\nHeliconiidæ, and the Acræidæ, there are species, distributed over the\r\nsame area, which resemble each other in their conspicuous colouring\r\nand marking, and also in the peculiar shape of the wings. After what\r\nhas been said one might be inclined to regard one of these species as\r\nthe unpalatable model and the others as the palatable mimics, but they\r\nare all unpalatable, and are not eaten by birds. The puzzle of this\r\napparent contradiction was solved by Fritz Müller[4], who pointed out\r\nthat the aversion to non-edible butterflies is not innate in birds, but\r\nmust be acquired. Each young bird has to learn from experience which\r\nvictim is good to eat, and which bad. If every inedible species had\r\nits particular and distinctive colour-dress a considerable number of\r\nindividuals of each species would fall victims to the experiments of\r\nyoung birds in each generation, for a butterfly which has once been\r\npecked at, or squeezed by the bill of a bird, is doomed to die. But if\r\ntwo inedible species which resemble each other inhabit the same area\r\nthey will be regarded by the birds as one and the same, and if five or\r\nmore inedible species resemble each other all five will present the\r\nsame appearance to the bird, and it will not require to repeat on the\r\nother four the experience of unpalatability it has gained from one.\r\nThus the total of five species will be no more severely decimated by\r\nthe young birds than each of them would have been if it had occurred\r\nalone; the same number of victims of experiment, which are necessary\r\nevery year in the education of the young birds, will, when all five\r\nspecies look alike, be divided among the whole 'mimicry ring,' as we\r\nmay say. The advantage of the resemblance is thus obvious, and we\r\ncan understand why a process of selection should develop among such\r\ninedible species which should result in their being readily mistaken\r\nfor one another; we can understand why, in the neighbourhood of Fritz\r\nMüller's home, Blumenau, in the province of Santa Catarina in South\r\nBrazil, the Danaidæ, species of _Lycorea_; the Heliconiidæ, _Heliconius\r\neucrate_ and _Eueides isabella_; and the Neotropinæ, _Mechanitis\r\nlysimnia_ and species of _Melinæa_, should all exhibit the same\r\ncolours, brown, black and yellow, in a similar pattern, on similarly\r\nshaped wings. The agreement is by no means perfect in detail, but it\r\ncan be noticed in all parts of South America inhabited by species of\r\nthese genera, and the same differences which distinguish, for instance,\r\nthe two species of _Heliconius_ flying in two different regions,\r\nalso distinguish the two species of _Eueides_ and the two species\r\nof _Mechanitis_. In Honduras we find the same mutually protective\r\ncompany of inedible genera as in Santa Catarina, but represented by\r\nother species, which all differ from the species in Santa Catarina\r\nin the same characters, as, for instance, that they have two instead\r\nof one pale yellow cross-stripe on the anterior wings. The species\r\nare: _Lycorea atergatis_, _Heliconius telchinia_, _Eueides dynastes_,\r\n_Mechanitis doryssus_, and _Melinæa imitata_[5]. In the environs of\r\nBahia this mimicry ring consists of the following species: _Heliconius\r\neucrate_, _Lycorea halia_, _Mechanitis lysimnia_, and _Melinæa ethra_,\r\nas figured on Pl. II, Fig. 12, iv, and such a mutual assurance society\r\nhas always one or other edible species as mimic. The larger the mimetic\r\nassurance company is, the less harm can mimics do to it. In the case\r\nfigured it is two Pieridæ already known to us that have fairly well\r\nassumed the Heliconiid guise, namely, _Dismorphia astynome_ (Pl.\r\nII, Figs. 18 and 19) and _Perhybris pyrrha_ (Pl. II, Figs. 16 and 17).\r\nIn the latter of these the male still has, on the upper surface, just\r\nthe appearance of one of our common Garden-whites, while the female is\r\ncoloured quite like the Heliconiidæ, but without having lost the form\r\nof wing of the Whites. The larger the mimetic company is the greater\r\nwill be the protection afforded to its palatable mimics, since they\r\nwill be the more rarely seized by way of experiment. It is, of course,\r\nobvious that in this kind of mimicry--that is, in the imitation of an\r\nunpalatable and rejected species for protection--it is presupposed as\r\na general postulate that the edible mimics are considerably in the\r\nminority, as Darwin showed; for if it were otherwise their enemies\r\nwould soon discover that among the apparently unpalatable species there\r\nwere some which were pleasant to taste. Here, too, the facts bear out\r\nthe theory, although exceptions can easily be imagined, and do seem to\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n[4] _Kosmos_, vol. v, 1881, p. 260 onwards.\r\n\r\n[5] According to Poulton's report in _Nature_, July 6, 1889, of 'Sykes,\r\nNatural Selection in the Lepidoptera,' _Trans.

LIMENITIS ARCHIPPUS, (_a_) CATERPILLAR, (_b_) PUPA.\r\n\r\n_To face Plate I_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I. LONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD.]\r\n\r\nThis comparative rarity is true of the imitators of the Heliconiidæ\r\nand their great mimicry ring of unpalatable species, and is very\r\ngeneral. Thus, for instance, there is a series of palatable mimics of\r\nthe beautiful blue _Euplœæ_ of the Indo-Malayan region (Pl. III, Figs.\r\n25 and 27), but each of these mimics is rare compared with the hosts\r\nof the blue unpalatable company, for these immune butterflies also\r\noccur in many species, all similar to _Euplœa midamus_ or _binotata_\r\n(Pl. II, Figs. 1 and 3); and the same applies to the mimics of the\r\nIndo-Malayan Danaidæ. There are a great many _Danais_ species, all of\r\nthem resembling _Danais vulgaris_ (Pl. III, Fig. 20), which, when they\r\noccur together, form an inedible ring, and this ring is imitated by a\r\nwhole series of edible species, each of which is comparatively rare.\r\nAnd there are no fewer than six species of _Papilio_ which resemble\r\nthese Danaids to the point of being easily mistaken for them, while\r\nanother rare _Papilio_ effectively copies the iridescence of the blue\r\n_Euplœæ_--a coloration so unusual in the genus that the species has\r\nreceived the name of _Papilio paradoxus_.\r\n\r\nBut even in single species of butterflies immune through unpalatability\r\nthere is usually a great abundance of individuals. Thus _Danais\r\nchrysippus_, which is distributed over the whole of Africa, is a very\r\ncommon butterfly wherever it can live at all; and in North America,\r\nin which country there are only two widely distributed species of\r\n_Danais_, these often occur in enormous numbers. The beautiful large\r\n_Danais erippus_ Cramer (Pl. I, Fig. 8), is distributed over almost all\r\nAmerica, and in many places is not only frequent, but occurs in great\r\nswarms. Usually it peoples the broad, open stretches of the western\r\nprairies of the United States, but when violent winds blow, as they\r\ndo there in September especially, the insects are driven together\r\ninto the small wooded spots of the prairie, and then they cover the\r\ntrees in incredibly large crowds, often so thickly that the leaves are\r\nentirely hidden, and the trees look brown instead of green. Millions of\r\nbutterflies go to make up such swarms, which have been observed in many\r\nparts of the United States, even quite in the East, in New Jersey, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nConsidering this extraordinary abundance of the immune species, it\r\nis not surprising that its palatable copy, _Limenitis archippus_\r\n(Pl. I, Fig. 9), should also be widely distributed in North America,\r\nand in many places it is not rare, but even abundant. The enormous\r\nmajority of _Danais erippus_ will protect the species which resembles\r\nit so closely, even though it is not rare. Any doubt as to this being\r\na case of mimicry disappears in face of the fact that, in Florida,\r\nthere flies a second very similar but much darker brown North American\r\n_Danais_, and that it is accompanied there by an equally dark variety\r\nof _Limenitis archippus_ (_L. eros_).\r\n\r\nTo prove the correctness of the hypothesis of an actual process of\r\nselection--which we assume in our interpretation of mimicry--I mean\r\nthe assumption that the disguise of the species seeking protection\r\nreally deceives the enemy, and thus actually affords protection, I\r\nneed only cite the evidence of an acute and experienced entomologist\r\nwho was himself deceived by it. Seitz[6], to whom we owe many valuable\r\nbiological observations on butterflies, relates that, while he was\r\ncollecting in the neighbourhood of the town of Bahia, he was surrounded\r\nby swarms of _Catopsiliæ_, similar to our lemon butterfly, especially\r\nthe common _Catopsilia argante_, but he took no notice of these, as he\r\n'had already collected as many of them as he wanted.' It was only when\r\nhe saw a pair _in copula_ that he caught them in his net. But to his\r\nextreme surprise he found that he had not caught a _Catopsilia_, but a\r\nbutterfly of the family Nymphalidæ, one of those _Anææ_ whose numerous\r\nspecies are distributed over South America. These _Anææ_ are dark, or\r\nbeautifully bright on the upper surface, but on the under side are\r\nleaf-coloured, and one of them bears the name _Anæa opalina_, because\r\nit is quite clear and pale, and of opal-like brilliance. The captive\r\nwas nearly related to this species. Seitz was so much surprised\r\nby the discovery that the male, which had quickly detached itself from\r\nthe female, escaped him, and he could only make out that, 'as it flew\r\naway, it unfolded dark wings, which certainly bore little resemblance\r\nto those of the lemon butterfly.' In the hope of securing more of\r\nthis rare booty he then hunted only for _Catopsilia argante_, without\r\nhowever securing another coveted specimen--he caught no more _Anœæ_,\r\nwhich shows that in this case, too, the mimetic species was much rarer.\r\n\r\n[6] In citing this observation of Seitz, I do not mean to assert that\r\nthere is true mimicry between _Anæa opalina_, or its allied species\r\nin Bahia, and the _Catopsilia_, though I regard this as extremely\r\nprobable, because of the marked dimorphism between the male and the\r\nfemale, in conjunction with the very striking resemblance of the female\r\nto the _Catopsilia_. The example was given only to show how very\r\ndeceptive such resemblances may be. To assert with confidence that it\r\nis a case of mimicry we should require to know that _Catopsilia_ is\r\nimmune, and on that point we have as yet no information.\r\n\r\nPLATE II\r\n\r\n FIG.\r\n\r\n 12-15 REPRESENT A 'MIMICRY-RING' COMPOSED OF FOUR IMMUNE SPECIES\r\n BELONGING TO THREE DIFFERENT FAMILIES AND FOUR DIFFERENT GENERA.\r\n\r\n 12.

LONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD.]\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the need for protection in butterflies has a great\r\ninfluence on their external appearance, especially as regards their\r\ncolour and marking. First, because the resting insect frequently has\r\nthe visible surfaces sympathetically coloured, and also, because there\r\nare numerous species, indeed whole families, which contain nauseous,\r\nperhaps even actually poisonous, juices, and these have been subject\r\nto a double process of selection, directed towards the increase of the\r\nnauseousness, and at the same time towards acquiring as conspicuous\r\na dress as possible. Thus the whole surface of these butterflies\r\nbecame gaily coloured, and often--as in many of the tropical nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera which fly by day, the Agaristidæ, Euschemidæ, and\r\nGlaucopidæ--quite glaringly bright. We thus understand the striking\r\nor at least readily recognizable colours of the Heliconiidæ, the\r\nEuplœæ, the Danaidæ, and the Acræidæ. Finally, the unpalatable species\r\ninfluence many others which are edible, since the latter strive to\r\nresemble an immune species; and how considerable the variations and\r\ncolour transformations thus induced can be is shown by the Whites of\r\nthe genus _Perhybris_ (Pl. II, Figs. 16 and 17) and _Archonias_, in\r\nwhich the male has wholly or partially retained the primitive dress of\r\nthe Whites, and in which, side by side with wholly mimetic species,\r\nother species occur in which both sexes exhibit the garb of the Whites\r\nunaltered. Such cases tell decidedly against the often expressed view\r\nthat mimetic species must have had from the outset a great resemblance\r\nto the model; they show rather that very great deviations in form,\r\nbut more especially in colour, have been brought about solely by the\r\nnecessity for mimetic adaptation, and that they have come about only\r\nslowly and step by step, as the different grades of resemblance to the\r\nmodel in different species of the same genus clearly show.\r\n\r\nLepidoptera are by no means the only insects which exhibit the\r\nphenomenon of mimicry, nor are insects the only animals in which it\r\noccurs; and unpleasant taste and odour are not the only protective\r\ncharacters; there are many others, as, for instance, among insects, the\r\nhardness of the chitinous cuticle.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful examples of mimicry was discovered by\r\nGerstäcker, not in free nature, but in the entomological collection at\r\nBerlin. There he found beside a green, metallic weevil-beetle, one of\r\nthe Pachyrhynchidæ from the Philippines, two other insects with the\r\nsame metallic sheen and very similar form of body. They had been put in\r\nbeside the weevil as duplicates, but more careful observation showed\r\nthat they were delicate Gryllidæ, which mimicked the hard beetles\r\nso deceptively that even the practised eye of the entomologist was\r\nmisled by them. Later on it was shown that these Gryllids live in the\r\nPhilippines beside the weevils, and even on the same leaves with them,\r\nand that the beetles are protected from the attacks of birds and other\r\nenemies by the extraordinary hardness of their cuticle. The case is\r\nespecially remarkable because in general the Gryllidæ have no metallic\r\nshimmer, and the form of body must have been considerably altered to\r\nmake them resemble the beetle. The usually broad head of the Gryllids\r\nis in this case narrower, the usually flat wing-covers are arched and\r\npear-shaped, and the legs have become quite beetle-like. The security\r\nenjoyed by the weevil must be very perfect, for it is mimicked by three\r\nother species of beetle in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAnimals can also be protected from attack by the possession of\r\ndangerous weapons. To this class belong insects with poisonous\r\nstings, like the bees, wasps, and ants, and in some degree also the\r\nichneumon-flies. We cannot wonder, therefore, that these dreaded\r\nspecies find imitators. In this case it is not of so much importance\r\nthat the copy should be rarer than the model, for anything that looks\r\nlike a dangerous insect will be avoided, since close investigation is\r\nin this case attended with danger. So we find that hornets, wasps,\r\nand bees are frequently imitated by other insects, by beetles, flies,\r\nand butterflies; and these must derive a certain advantage, even\r\nwhen the resemblance is only a general one. Many Longicorns, which\r\nvisit flowers, are striped black and yellow, like a wasp, and so are\r\nmany flies, like the species of _Syrphus_, and so on. The Longicorn\r\n_Necydalis major_ bears a strong resemblance to a large ichneumon-fly;\r\nit has the same long-drawn-out body, the same swellings on the femur\r\nand tibia, the curved antennæ, the glossy brown colour, and its\r\nwing-covers are quite short, leaving the wings free, so that the\r\ndeception is very complete.\r\n\r\nBees, too, are sometimes so well imitated that they are hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from their mimics, not in flight only, but also when\r\nvisiting flowers. The best and commonest mimic of our honey-bee is\r\na perfectly harmless fly of the same size and colour, the drone-fly\r\n(_Eristalis tenax_). The two are often to be seen together on the\r\nsame flowering shrub, as, for instance, in autumn, on the Japanese\r\nbuckwheat of our gardens (_Polygonum sieboldii_), both busily seeking\r\nfor honey. I once noticed a boy catching the flies with a net in order\r\nto imprison them, but a bee stung him severely in the finger. He\r\nimmediately abandoned the chase, and gave up the flies, perceiving the\r\ndangers of confusion. So the animal enemies of _Eristalis_ will often\r\nprefer to leave it in peace rather than run the risk of being stung.\r\n\r\nPLATE III\r\n\r\n FIG.\r\n\r\n 24.

LONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD.]\r\n\r\nThere is still another relation between two species which can be\r\ninduced by mimicry--namely, parasitism, when, for instance, the\r\nso-called cuckoo-bees and parasitic humble-bees deceptively resemble\r\nin colour, arrangement of hair, and form of body, the species into\r\nwhose nests they smuggle their eggs, to have them brought up at the\r\nexpense of the bee or humble-bee in question. In the same way, among\r\nthe numerous parasites of ant nests, there are some which copy the ants\r\nthemselves, and so secure themselves from molestation, although they\r\ndevour the ants' eggs and pupæ. Thus, among the hosts of South American\r\ndriver-ants (_Eciton prædator_) there lives a predaceous beetle of the\r\nfamily Staphylinæ, which has received the name _Mimeciton_ because it\r\nresembles the ant in form and in the nature of the external surface,\r\nthough not in colour, which is to be explained by the fact that this\r\nant has no compound eyes, and is therefore almost blind, or at any rate\r\ncannot see colours.\r\n\r\nI should never come to an end were I to attempt to exhibit the great\r\nwealth of observations now available in regard to mimicry. But this\r\nat least may be added, that isolated cases of mimicry have been found\r\neven among Vertebrates. Thus, according to Wallace, the red-and-black\r\nstriped poisonous coral snake of South America (_Elaps_) is most\r\nrealistically imitated by a non-poisonous snake (_Erythrolampus_) of\r\nthe same region. Among birds, Wallace cites a few cases which may be\r\nregarded as mimicry, but none are known among mammals, which is not\r\nto be wondered at when we consider how very much less numerous in\r\nindividuals the species are which live together on one area, and how\r\nmuch less likely it is that two species should be, to begin with, so\r\nnear each other in size, habit, and form that the process of natural\r\nselection could bring about a deceptive degree of resemblance.\r\nWithout doubt it is among insects that the conditions for mimicry are\r\nespecially favourable, partly because of the enormous number of species\r\nwhich live together and have interrelations on the same area, even in\r\nour latitudes and much more so in the tropics, and also because of\r\ntheir usually great fecundity, and their rapid multiplication, both of\r\nwhich are factors favourable to starting and continuing the processes\r\nof natural selection. Furthermore, we have to take into account the\r\nhosts of enemies which depend wholly or in great part on insects for\r\nfood, and destroy them in enormous numbers, eliminating them in inverse\r\nproportion to the perfection of their adaptation. Finally, there is the\r\nextreme susceptibility of many insects to injury. This makes it very\r\ndesirable that they should have some disguise sufficient to protect\r\nthem from even the first attempt at an attack, since that would in many\r\ncases prove fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE VI\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE ADAPTATIONS IN PLANTS\r\n\r\n Protection against large animals--Poisons--Ethereal oils--Spines and\r\n thorns--Sharp and stinging-hairs--Felt-hairs--Position of the thorns:\r\n buckthorn--Tragacanth shrub--Prigana scrub--Alpine shrubs--Protection\r\n against small enemies--Chemical substances--Mechanical protective\r\n arrangements--Raphides--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen in how many different ways animals are able to adapt\r\nthemselves to the conditions of life, both protectively and\r\naggressively; how they approximate in their colour to that of their\r\nsurroundings so that they harmonize with it; how they copy lifeless\r\nobjects, or parts of plants, leaves, or twigs, or even mimic, in form\r\nand colour, other animals which are in some way protected. When we\r\nconsider that by far the greater number of species find protection in\r\nsome degree through their colouring, and often through their form, and\r\nwhen, at the same time, we remember how different this colouring is in\r\nnearly related species, and even within the same species (dimorphism),\r\nwe can scarcely avoid the impression that the forms of life are made of\r\na plastic material, which, like the sculptor's clay, can be kneaded at\r\nwill into almost any desired form.\r\n\r\nThis impression is corroborated when we turn our attention to plants,\r\nand consider the different ways in which they are able to protect\r\nthemselves from the attacks of animals.\r\n\r\nThat plants stand in need of some protection is obvious enough, since\r\ntheir leaves and other green parts contain much nourishment, and an\r\nendless army of animals, large and small, depends upon these alone for\r\nsustenance. Indeed, the existence of animals depends altogether on the\r\noccurrence of plants, for carnivorous and saprophytic animals could\r\nonly arise after vegetarian forms had been already in existence. But if\r\nthe green parts of the plants were left defenceless at the mercy of the\r\nmultitude of herbivorous animals, it would not be long before they were\r\nexterminated from the face of the earth, for the animals would devour\r\nunsparingly whatever was within their reach, and, as their increase\r\ndoes not depend on their ratio of elimination alone, but also on their\r\nfertility, and on their rapidity of multiplication, they would go on\r\nincreasing in numbers at the expense of the superabundant nourishment\r\nuntil the plants on which they depended were themselves consumed.\r\n\r\nWhen we inquire into the means whereby plants evade such a fate we are\r\nastonished at the endless diversity of the devices employed.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first of all the menace to plants from the larger\r\nherbivores, from elephants and cattle down to the hare and the\r\nroe-deer; we find that many plants are protected by poisons, which\r\ndevelop in the sap of their stems, leaves, roots, and fruits. The\r\njuicy and beautifully leaved Belladonna (_Atropa belladonna_) is never\r\ntouched by roe-deer, stags, or other herbivores, and the same is true\r\nof the thorn-apple (_Datura stramonium_), the henbane (_Hyoscyamus\r\nniger_), the spotted hemlock (_Conium maculatum_), the danewort of\r\nour woods (_Sambucus ebulus_), and many others; they all contain a\r\npoison. Like the unpalatable butterflies, these unpalatable plants are\r\nalso furnished with a warning sign of their undesirability, namely, a\r\ndisagreeable odour, perceptible even by man, which scares off animals\r\nfrom touching them. The development of this through natural selection\r\npresents no very serious difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut, strangely enough, there are not a few poisonous plants in which\r\nwe, at least, are unable to detect any such warning sign. Among these\r\nare the blue aconite (_Aconitum_), the black hellebore (_Helleborus\r\nniger_), the meadow-saffron (_Colchicum autumnale_), species of\r\nGentian, of spurge (_Euphorbia_), and others. Yet these are avoided by\r\ndeer, roe-deer, chamois, hares, and marmots, and our cattle, horses,\r\nand sheep also usually leave them untouched. A case has, however, been\r\nreported from the valley of the Aur, on the lower Rhine, which seems to\r\ncontradict this. On the rocky grass-slopes of the valley the poisonous\r\nhellebore (_Helleborus viridis_) grows in great abundance, and the\r\nsheep of that region, which were wont to graze on the slopes, avoided\r\nthese plants. But some sheep from another part were imported into the\r\nvalley, and these ate the hellebore, with the result that many died.\r\nIf these poisonous plants, then, were furnished with a warning sign\r\nsuch as a disagreeable odour, not perceptible to us, we should have to\r\nassume that the imported sheep had a less acute sense of smell than\r\nthe others, which is not impossible in domesticated animals. If there\r\nwere no such warning sign, then it must have been not an instinct but a\r\ncontinuous _tradition_ which prevented the native sheep from touching\r\nthe inedible plants.\r\n\r\nA more naïve interpretation of nature than that of our day would have\r\nregarded the fragrant ethereal oils developed in the seeds of many\r\nplants, as in those of fennel, cummin, and other Umbelliferous plants,\r\nas a peculiarity designed for the use and profit of man. But these\r\nethereal substances are obviously a means of protection against the\r\ndepredations of seed-eating birds, for a sparrow which was allowed to\r\neat three or four seeds of cummin died very soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nMany plants produce bitter substances in their green parts, and so\r\nsecure at least some measure of protection, as is the case with the\r\nmajority of mosses, the ferns, and species of _Plantago_ and _Linaria_.\r\nOthers, again, deposit silicic acid in their cell-walls, or develop in\r\naddition a very thick epidermis, so that they afford at the best an\r\nunpleasant food, e.g. many grasses, the horse-tails, the rhododendron,\r\nand the bilberry. Others, again (_Alchemilla vulgaris_), have\r\ncup-shaped leaves, which retain rain and dew for a long time, and this\r\nprotects them from grazing animals, which are unwilling to touch wet\r\ngrass and plants.\r\n\r\nEspecially widely distributed and diverse is the protection of plants\r\nby sharp thorns and spines. It is extremely interesting to note in how\r\nmany different and advantageous ways this armature is disposed.\r\n\r\nObvious at once is the fact that thorns and spines only occur on\r\nthose parts which are naturally exposed to attack. Thus we find them\r\nparticularly strong in young plants, and on the lower parts of older\r\nones. The holly, for instance, has crenate, spinose leaves only to the\r\nheight to which grazing animals can reach; beyond that the leaves are\r\nsmooth-edged and spineless, like those of the camelia. It is almost the\r\nsame with some wild pear-trees, which are quite covered with thorns as\r\nlong as they are low, but afterwards grow a thornless crown.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, low bushes, when they are armed with thorns or the like at\r\nall, are covered with them all over, like the rose-bush.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves of a plant are spinose the spines are disposed on\r\nthe parts usually attacked; and thus we understand why the enormous\r\nfloating leaves of _Victoria regia_ should have on their under surface\r\nlong, pointed spines which, especially at the upturned margin, attain a\r\nlength of several inches; it is from water animals--water snails--that\r\ndanger threatens them.\r\n\r\nThorns are developed in the most diverse ways. In many of the bushes\r\non the coast of the Mediterranean true leaves are wanting altogether,\r\nthe green branches and twigs being themselves the assimilating parts,\r\nand these are so stiff and rigid, so like some kind of thorn, that they\r\nsuffice to scare off any greedy herbivore. Among our own bushes the\r\nBroom (_Spartium scoparium_) may be taken as an example of this class.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the spines are found on the leaves themselves, but\r\nthere is great diversity in their mode of arrangement. In many\r\ntropical plants, such as the Yucca and the Aloe, the point of the\r\nlong, reed-shaped leaf is transformed into a spine, and this is the\r\ncase in many of our native grasses. Kerner von Marilaun notes that, in\r\nthe Southern Alps, two such grasses, _Festuca alpestris_ and _Nardus\r\nstricta_, occur frequently in certain localities, and they prick the\r\nmuzzles of the cattle so badly that they return bleeding from the\r\npasture. This prevents these Alpine runs from being made full use of,\r\nso the grasses are as far as possible extirpated by man, and, curiously\r\nenough, also by the cattle themselves, for they seize the grass at the\r\nbase of the tuft with their teeth, pull it out, and let it fall, so\r\nthat it withers. Kerner saw thousands of such pieces of turf which had\r\nbeen pulled up by the cattle lying dried and bleached by the sun on\r\nsome of the Alpine grazing grounds in the Tyrolese Stubaithal.\r\n\r\nAgain, in many plants the whole leaf-edge is transformed into a spiny\r\nwall, which may be enlarged by indentations and lobate projections,\r\nas in the holly, and, in a much higher degree, in the thistles\r\n(_Carduus_), in _Eryngium_, in _Acanthus_, and in many Solanaceæ.\r\nOften, too, there are barbed hooks on the leaf-edge, which work like\r\na saw; or the leaf-edge, though without spines, may be made sharp by\r\ndeposits of silicic acid, as in the sedges, whose sharp edges are\r\nmoved to and fro in the mouths of ruminants, and thus injure the\r\nmucous membrane. The hook-bristles of the fig-cactus (_Opuntia_),\r\nwhich, though small, are abundantly provided with barbs, must also be\r\nmentioned; for they are to be found in great numbers surrounding the\r\nbuds of these plants, and most effectively protect them from being\r\neaten away by animals (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\nTo this category, too, belong the short, prickly bristles of the\r\nrough-leaved plants, which cover the whole plant as with an overcoat\r\nof sharp needles; of these we may mention the adder's tongue (_Echium\r\nvulgare_), the comfrey (_Symphytum officinale_), and the borage\r\n(_Borago officinalis_).\r\n\r\nVery well known are the stinging-hairs of the Urticaceæ, long hairs\r\n(Fig. 20) with an elastic base, but with glass-like, brittle, rounded\r\nheads, which break off at the lightest touch, whereupon the sharp\r\npoint of the broken hair penetrates the skin of the creature which has\r\ntouched it, and the poisonous contents of the hair are poured into\r\nthe wound. Even our large stinging-nettle (_Urtica dioica_) can cause\r\nintense irritation, and evoke the 'nettle-rash,' named after it, on\r\nthe human skin; but there are many tropical species of nettle, e.g.\r\n_Urtica stimulata_ in Java, and others, which have an effect similar\r\nto that of snake-poison and produce tetanoid spasms, and so on. In\r\naddition to formic acid these hairs contain an undefined ferment, a\r\nso-called Enzyme. It need scarcely be said that these stinging-hairs\r\nmust have much more severe effects on the mucous membrane of the mouth\r\nof grazing animals than on the human skin, and that they are therefore\r\nan excellent protection for the plants. As a matter of fact we never\r\nfind our nettle patches eaten away, and even the donkey, which eats\r\nthistles freely, turns away from the stinging-nettle. But even these\r\nstinging-hairs, like all other protective devices, do not afford an\r\n_absolute_ protection. The caterpillars of several of our diurnal\r\nbutterflies feed exclusively on the stinging-nettle, and they eat up\r\nthe leaves, stinging-hairs and all. This is the case with five species\r\nof the genus _Vanessa_, namely: _Vanessa io_, the 'peacock,' _Vanessa\r\nurticæ_, the small tortoiseshell, _Vanessa prorsa_, _Vanessa C. album_,\r\nthe C. butterfly, and _Vanessa atalanta_, the admiral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Barbed bristles of _Opuntia rafinesquii_;\r\nenlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Vertical section through a piece of a leaf of\r\nthe Stinging-nettle _(Urtica dioica_), bearing two stinging-hairs;\r\nmagnified 85 times; adapted from Kerner and Haberlandt.]\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with our mulleins (_Verbascum_), those beautiful\r\nflower-spikes with the thick, soft felt leaves, which grow on stony or\r\nsandy soil. Harmless as they look, they are much disliked by animals\r\nas food, for the thick hairy felt which covers them breaks up in the\r\nmouth, and sticks in the folds of the mucous membrane, causing burning\r\nsensations and other discomforts. They, too, are therefore spared by\r\ngrazing animals, but they have smaller enemies, like the caterpillars\r\nof the genus _Cucullia_, which, however, never completely destroy them,\r\nbut only eat large holes in their leaves.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider in somewhat greater detail the true thorns, the\r\nmost conspicuous protection of many plants. It is very remarkable that\r\nthese are always so placed, and so regulated as to their length and\r\ncharacter, as to afford protection to the most important and the most\r\nexposed parts of the plant. Thus many bushes, which would otherwise be\r\nin danger of being completely devoured by cattle, are stiff with thorns\r\nwhich are nothing else than pointed, hard twigs without, or with very\r\nlittle foliage. Among these are the sloes, the buckthorn (_Rhamnus_),\r\nthe sea-buckthorn (_Hippophäe_), and the barberry (_Berberis_). In the\r\nlast-named three thorns arise in a group, and protect the young bud\r\nfrom danger in three directions (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. A piece of a twig of Barberry (_Berberis\r\nvulgaris_) in spring; after Kerner.]\r\n\r\nThe fine-leaved mimosas of the tropics have similar but very long and\r\nsharp thorns, and their leaves are movable and sensitive, so that, when\r\nthey are touched, they shut up and draw back behind the rampart of\r\nstiff thorns, which are just of the right length to protect them.\r\n\r\nIn many thorny bushes only the young shoots of each spring remain\r\ngreen through the summer, and in autumn they become transformed into\r\nthorns, under whose protection the shoots of the following spring will\r\ndevelop. Sometimes, too, the leaf-stalks are modified in the course of\r\nthe summer into thorns, as in Tragacanth (_Astragalus tragacantha_).\r\nIn this case the young leaves are protected by a circle of thorns,\r\nconsisting of the leaf-stalks of the preceding year which have not\r\nfallen off (Fig. 22, _A_, _B_, _C_).\r\n\r\nI should have to go on for a long time with my exposition, even if I\r\nwere to confine attention to the essential facts; we shall, therefore,\r\nonly recall the well-known phenomenon of the Cactuses, in which the\r\nleaves are entirely transformed into spines, which may attain a length\r\nof eight centimetres, while the fleshy stem alone represents the\r\ngreen--that is, the assimilating parts of the plant. The species of\r\nCactus are almost the only plants which grow on the stony, hard, and\r\nhot plateaux of Mexico, and they are protected from desiccation by the\r\nthickness of their epidermis. But, enticing as is the food promised\r\nby the juicy stem, animals rarely venture to approach them, and it is\r\nonly when tortured by thirst that horses and asses occasionally knock\r\noff the spines with their hoofs, and so reach the soft tissues rich in\r\nwater. For this attempt, however, as Alexander von Humboldt pointed\r\nout, they often suffer, as the sharp spines are apt to pierce the hoof.\r\nIn any case, the cactuses are effectively protected from the danger of\r\nextermination by grazing animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Tragacanth (_Astragalus tragacantha_). _A_,\r\ntwo spring shoots. _B_, a single leaf, from which the three uppermost\r\nleaflets have fallen off. _C_, leaf midrib, from which all the leaflets\r\nhave fallen off. After Kerner.]\r\n\r\nIt must certainly strike every one that many districts, especially\r\nthose which are dry, hot, and stony, are conspicuously rich in thorny\r\nplants, and it has often been supposed that the production of thorns\r\nmust be a direct result of these peculiar conditions of life; indeed,\r\nthe hard, thorny habit of many of these plants has even been regarded\r\nas a protection against desiccation. This, however, is contradicted\r\nby all those thorny plants which, like the cactuses, possess tissues\r\nextremely rich in sap, and in which desiccation is prevented, not\r\nby the thorns, but by the thick epidermis. The only satisfactory\r\nexplanation is that afforded in terms of natural selection. In such\r\nhot, and at the same time dry regions, the plant-growth is often very\r\nscanty, and the food available for the grazing animals is, at least at\r\ntimes, very scarce; on this account, if the plants are to survive there\r\nat all, they must be armed with the most perfect means of protection\r\npossible against the attacks of hungry and thirsty animals. The\r\nstruggle for existence in relation to such enemies is much more severe\r\nthan in more luxuriant regions, and the protection by thorns has been\r\ndeveloped to the highest possible pitch of perfection; species which\r\nwere unable to develop this protection died out altogether. Hence the\r\ncactuses of Mexico, and the many thorny bushes and shrubs of the hot,\r\nand, in the summer, dried-up stony coast-lands of the Mediterranean in\r\nSpain, Corsica, Africa, and other countries. This so-called 'Prigana\r\nscrub' embraces a number of species, whose nearest relatives in our\r\nclimate are not provided with spines, as, for instance, _Genista\r\nhispanica_, _Onobrychis cornuta_, _Sonchus cervicornus_, _Euphorbia\r\nspinosa_, _Stachys spinosa_, and others.\r\n\r\nWhy do so few thorny plants grow on the rich and well-watered Alpine\r\npastures? Probably because there is to be found there a rich and\r\nluxuriant plant-growth which can never be wholly exterminated by\r\nthe grazing of animals, so that an individual species would not, by\r\ndeveloping thorns, have gained any advantage in the way of increased\r\ncapacity for existence.\r\n\r\nBut these Alpine grazing grounds serve well to illustrate how great\r\nmay be the advantage which protective devices give to a species.\r\nMuch to the annoyance of the herdsmen, who endeavour to extirpate\r\nthem as far as possible, enormous masses of rhododendrons often\r\ncover whole stretches, because their hard silicious leaves cannot be\r\neaten, and many other plants despised of cattle flourish and increase\r\non the grazing runs, like the repulsively bitter, large _Gentiana\r\nasclepiadea_, the malodorous _Aposeris fœtida_, and various ferns of\r\ndisagreeable taste.\r\n\r\nThe advantage derived by plants from the possession of any kind of\r\nprotective device against grazing animals is perhaps best of all seen\r\nin the 'shrubbery,' which on every Alp is to be found in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the herdsman's hut. There, where the cattle daily\r\nassemble, and where the soil is continually being richly manured by\r\nthem, we always find a large, luxuriantly growing company of the\r\npoisonous aconite, the bitter goosefoot (_Chenopodium bonus henricus_),\r\nthe stinging-nettle, the thistle (_Cirsium spinosissimum_), the\r\nill-smelling _Atriplex_, and some other inedible species, while the\r\npalatable herbs are gradually exterminated by the cattle which daily\r\ngather round the hut (Kerner).\r\n\r\nTo sum up. We have seen that there is among plants an extraordinary\r\ndiversity of protective adaptations, which secures them from\r\nextermination by the larger herbivores.\r\n\r\nSince all useful contrivances, or, as we say, all adaptations, are\r\ncapable of interpretation in terms of the process of selection, we\r\nmust refer this great array of the most diverse protective devices\r\nto natural selection; and again, as among animals, we receive the\r\nimpression that the organism is, to a certain extent, really capable\r\nof producing every variation necessary to its maintenance. Literally\r\nspeaking, this would not be correct, but at any rate the number of\r\nadaptations possible to each form of life must be an enormous one, so\r\ngreat, indeed, that ultimately every species does secure protection\r\nfor itself in some manner and in some degree, whether it be by the\r\nproduction of a poison or a nauseous substance within itself, or by\r\nsurrounding itself with thorns or spines. And if it be, in a certain\r\nsense, a matter of 'chance' whether a plant has taken to one method of\r\ndefence or to another, according as its innate constitution favoured\r\nthe production of one rather than of any other, yet it would not\r\nbe easy to prove, even in the case of the purely chemical means of\r\nprotection, that these would have occurred in the same distribution\r\nand concentration as a necessary result of the metabolism of the\r\nplant, even if they had not been useful and consequently augmented\r\nby selection. But in the case of the mechanical means of protection\r\nthis mode of explanation fails as utterly as that of the direct\r\neffect of the conditions of life. Why the holly should have spinose\r\nleaves beneath and smooth ones above can never be deduced from the\r\nconstitution of the species.\r\n\r\nWhile the protective adaptations of plants against the larger\r\nherbivores always point to natural selection, our appreciation of the\r\nadaptability of plants, and at the same time of the potency of natural\r\nselection, will be strengthened still more if we turn our attention for\r\na little to the arrangements which prevent the extermination of plants\r\nby the lower and small animals.\r\n\r\nIt might indeed be supposed that extermination by these could hardly\r\nbe an imminent danger, but if we think of the cockchafer blight, or of\r\nthe destruction of whole woods by the caterpillar of the 'white nun,'\r\nor even of the destruction of several successive plantings of young\r\nsalad plants which the snails often cause in our gardens, it cannot be\r\ndoubted that all plants would be exterminated by insects and snails\r\nalone unless they were protected against them in some degree.\r\n\r\nWe owe our detailed knowledge of the means by which plants protect\r\nthemselves against the menace of the greedy and prolific snails to\r\nthe beautiful investigations of Stahl, Professor of Botany in the\r\nUniversity of Jena.\r\n\r\nIn this case, too, both chemical and mechanical means are made use of.\r\nThe minute quantity of tannic acid which is contained in the leaves of\r\nthe clover prevents many snails from eating them, as, for instance,\r\nthe garden snail (_Helix hortensis_). If the leaves be soaked so as\r\nto wash out the tannin the snail readily accepts them as food. It is\r\ntrue that the small, whitish field-slug (_Limax agrestis_) does not\r\nobject to the presence of the tannin, and eats the fresh leaves of\r\nthe clover; indeed, there is no such thing as absolute protection.\r\nIn discussing the herbivorous mammals I have already mentioned that\r\nmany trees and shrubs, mosses and ferns are effectively protected by\r\nthe large amount of tannin they contain; this protection is effective\r\nalso against snails, for all these plants are fairly free from their\r\nattacks; and the same is true of many other tannin-containing plants,\r\nspecies of saxifrage and sedum, the strawberry, many water-plants, like\r\nthe pond-weeds (_Potamogeton_), the horn-nut (_Trapa_), the mare's tail\r\n(_Hippuris_). All these plants are only eaten by snails in case of\r\nnecessity, or in the washed-out state.\r\n\r\nIn other plants protection is gained by means of some acid, especially\r\noxalic acid, like the wood-sorrel (_Oxalis acetosella_), the sorrel\r\n(_Rumex_), and the species of Begonia. When Stahl smeared slices of\r\ncarrot, which is a favourite food of snails, with a weak (one per\r\ncent.) solution of oxalate of potassium, they were refused by the\r\nsnails, and this is not surprising when we remember that even the\r\nexternal skin of the snail is very sensitive, and the mucous membrane\r\nof the mouth is not likely to be less so.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, many plants develop ethereal oils in the hairs which cover\r\nthem, as in the herb-Robert (_Geranium robertianum_). Even the almost\r\nomnivorous field-slug (_Limax agrestis_) does not touch this plant, and\r\nif it be placed upon it, escapes with all dispatch from the ethereal\r\noil, which burns its naked skin, by covering itself with mucus and\r\nletting itself down to the ground by a thread. The mints (_Mentha_) and\r\nthe dittany (_Dictamnus albus_) also produce such oils.\r\n\r\nAmong chemical means of protection must be named the pure bitter\r\nstuffs, such as are found in the species of gentian, the milkwort\r\n(_Polygala amara_), and in many other plants, and also the curious\r\n'oil-bodies' of the liverworts.\r\n\r\nBut some plants also defend themselves against the attacks of snails by\r\nmechanical means.\r\n\r\nFirst there are the various kinds of bristle arrangements, which\r\nprevent the snails from creeping up the stalks. We never find the\r\ncomfrey (_Symphytum officinale_) of our meadows eaten by snails,\r\nfor it is thickly covered over with stiff bristles, which are most\r\ndisagreeable to the snail, and the stinging-nettle (_Urtica dioica_) is\r\nsimilarly protected by bristle hairs, while, as we have already seen,\r\nits stinging-hairs secure immunity from the attacks of larger animals.\r\n\r\nAnd although it is true that the majority of plants do not prevent the\r\nsnails from creeping up their stalks, yet they do not serve them in any\r\ngreat degree as food, since the green parts often offer resistance to\r\nmastication and digestion. Thus the lime encrustations which cover the\r\nstoneworts (_Chara_) prevent snails from eating them. If the lime be\r\ndissolved by means of acids, and the plants then offered to the snails,\r\nthey will eat them greedily. The same is true of the silicifying of\r\nthe cell-walls, so widely distributed among mosses and grasses, and\r\nwhen this occurs in a high degree it forms an effective protection\r\neven against the large herbivores. Our slightly siliceous grasses are\r\nsecure from snails, and that it is really the presence of the silicic\r\nacid which deters them from an otherwise welcome kind of food is proved\r\nby Stahl's experiment of growing maize in pure water, and so obtaining\r\nplants poor in silica. These were devoured without ceremony by the\r\nsnails.\r\n\r\nOf the many other protective peculiarities which make it difficult for\r\nsnails to eat plants I shall only recall the so-called 'Raphides,'\r\nthose microscopic crystal-like needles of oxalate of lime, pointed\r\nat both ends, which lie close together in the tissues of many\r\nplants. Cuckoo pint (_Arum maculatum_), the narcissi, the snowdrops\r\n(_Leucojum_), the squill (_Scilla_), and the asparagus contain them,\r\nand all these plants are spared by snails obviously because during\r\nmastication they are unpleasantly affected by the raphides. Even the\r\nvoracious field-slug rejects these.\r\n\r\nOf course it cannot be said that these raphides protect against all\r\nother enemies. They are effective against rodents and ruminants,\r\nand also against locusts, but a number of caterpillars seek out by\r\npreference just those plants which contain raphides. Thus certain\r\ncaterpillars of the Sphingidæ feed on species of _Galium_ and\r\n_Epilobium_, the leaves of the vine, and the wild balsam (_Impatiens_).\r\nThe caterpillar of _Chærocampa elpenor_, which especially prefers\r\n_Vitis_ and _Epilobium_, has transferred its affections to the fuchsias\r\nin our gardens, which came from South America; the butterfly not\r\ninfrequently lays its eggs on these plants, and the caterpillars devour\r\nthem readily; but the fuchsias may also contain raphides.\r\n\r\nWe may say, indeed, that almost all wild Phanerogams are protected in\r\nsome degree against snails, and this almost suggests the question: What\r\nthen is left for the snails to feed on if everything is thus armed\r\nagainst them? But, in the first place, there remain our cultivated\r\nplants, which, like the garden lettuce (_Lactuca_), are quite without\r\ndefence; and secondly, the snails often eat the plants only after\r\nthey have been rooted up and lie rotting on the ground, that is,\r\nwhen the protective ingredient has been dissolved out by the rain;\r\nfinally, no means of protection, as I have often said already, is\r\nabsolute or effective against all snails. Many of these are, as Stahl\r\ncalls them, 'specialists.' Thus, the large slug of our woods eats the\r\npoisonous fungi which are rejected by other snails, and in the same\r\nway there are many other specialists which, however, are not likely to\r\neliminate unaided the plants to which they have adapted themselves.\r\nThere are certainly also omnivorous forms, like the field-slug\r\n(_Limax agrestis_), to which we have referred so often, and _Arion\r\nempiricorum_, the red slug, but just because these eat so many kinds of\r\nplant they are less dangerous to any one species.\r\n\r\nThese manifold devices for protecting plants against the depredations\r\nof snails afford another proof that innumerable details in the\r\norganization of plants, as of animals, must be referred to natural\r\nselection, since they are capable of interpretation in no other way.\r\nIf these protective devices were to be found only in isolated plants,\r\nwe might perhaps talk of 'chance'; we might refer them to the inborn\r\nconstitution of the plant, which made the production of bristles, or\r\nbitter stuffs, or the deposition of silicic acid a necessity, and which\r\n'happened' to make the plants distasteful to certain snails. But as\r\nit appears that all plants are protected against snails, one in this\r\nway, another in that, this objection cannot be sustained. Furthermore,\r\nsome of the beautiful experiments made by Stahl to prove the protective\r\neffect of these devices showed, at the same time, that they were not\r\nin themselves indispensable to the existence of the plant; maize, for\r\ninstance, develops a plant perfectly capable of life, even though\r\nsilicic acid be withheld, and the acid is, therefore, not an element\r\nessential to its constitution, but a means of protection against\r\nvoracious animals. The clearest proof of this is afforded by plants\r\nlike the lettuce (_Lactuca_), which formed protective stuffs in the\r\nwild state, but have lost them altogether under cultivation, through\r\ndisuse, as we shall see more precisely later on. As the eyes of animals\r\nwhich live in darkness have degenerated, so the plants which have been\r\ntaken under the protection of man have lost their natural means of\r\ndefence, because these were no longer necessary to the maintenance of\r\nthe species. Even the protective bitter substances (tannin-compounds)\r\nare not essential to the constitution of the genus _Lactuca_; their\r\nformation may be discontinued without the plant being otherwise\r\naffected. And in this case it is not a question of the withdrawal\r\nof something which has to be taken in from outside, it is the\r\nnon-development of what is purely a product of the internal metabolism.\r\n\r\nThe adaptations of plants against snails are instructive in another\r\nway, namely, in their extraordinary diversity. Here again we see how\r\ngreat is the plasticity of organic forms, and how precisely, though\r\nin many very different ways, they adapt themselves to the conditions\r\nof their life, in this case the weaknesses of their greedy enemies,\r\nand all to attain the same end, the security of their existence as a\r\nspecies. We see at the same time that innumerable minute details in the\r\nstructure and character of a species, which may appear unimportant, may\r\nyet have their definite uses--hairs, bristles, and raphides, as well as\r\nbitter substances, ethereal oils, acids, and tannin-compounds. But we\r\nmust, of course, have minute and exhaustive investigations, like those\r\nof Stahl, in regard to the biological relations of these peculiarities\r\nbefore their utility can become clear to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE VII\r\n\r\nCARNIVOROUS PLANTS\r\n\r\n Introduction--The Bladderworts or Utriculariæ--Pitcher-plants,\r\n Nepenthes--The Toothwort, Lathræa--The Butterwort, Pinguicula--The\r\n Sundew, Drosera--The Flytrap--Aldrovandia--Conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT the principle of selection dominates, to a large extent at least,\r\nall the structural characters of plants, and moulds these in direct\r\nrelation to the prospects of greater success which may be offered in\r\nthe vicissitudes of the life-conditions of a single species or group\r\nof species, is nowhere more apparent than in the case of the so-called\r\n'insectivorous' or 'carnivorous' plants. Here again it was Charles\r\nDarwin who led the way, for while many plants had long been known on\r\nthe sticky leaves of which insects were often caught and killed, it\r\nhad occurred to no one to regard this as of any special use for the\r\nplant, much less to look on the peculiar dispositions of such leaves\r\nas especially determined for this purpose. Darwin was the first to\r\nshow that there is no small number of plants--we now know about\r\n500--which secure only a portion of their nutritive material by the\r\nusual method of assimilation, and gain another and smaller portion by\r\ndissolving and utilizing animal protoplasm, especially nitrogenous\r\nmuscle substance. The correctness of this interpretation was at first\r\ndisputed, but Darwin showed that pieces of muscle, or any nitrogenous\r\norganic substance, were really dissolved by the relevant parts of the\r\nplant, and were afterwards absorbed. It can therefore no longer be\r\ndoubted that the remarkable contrivances by which animals are laid\r\nhold of by plants--are in a certain sense caught and killed--have\r\narisen with reference to this particular end; or, to speak less\r\nmetaphorically, that existing structural and functional peculiarities\r\nin a plant which caused animals to be held fast were of advantage to\r\nthe nutrition of the plant, and were therefore augmented and perfected\r\nby natural selection. That this was possible is obvious from the number\r\nof insectivorous plants which now live upon the earth, and that these\r\nprocesses of selection ran their courses quite independently of one\r\nanother, and even that they started from different parts of the plant,\r\nis shown by the diversity of the contrivances which occur in plants of\r\nseveral different families. A few of these I wish to discuss in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. _Utricularia grafiana_, after Kerner. _A_, a\r\nplant in its natural position, floating in the water. _FA_, traps. _B_,\r\na trap enlarged four times. _sz_, suctorial cells. _kl_, valve, which\r\ncloses the entrance to the trap. _C_, suctorial cells on the internal\r\nwall of the trap, enlarged 250 times.]\r\n\r\nThe marshes of European countries, and also those of warmer lands,\r\noften contain bladderworts, or Utriculariæ (Fig. 23)--floating\r\nwater-plants, without roots, and with horizontally spread,\r\nlong-drawn-out, tendril-like shoots, in part thickly covered with\r\nwhorls of delicate, needle-shaped leaves, in part bearing sparse\r\nleaves of quite peculiar structure. These are stalked, hollow\r\nbladders (Fig. 23 _A_, _FA_), with quite a narrow entrance at the\r\napex, which is closed, as far as larger animals are concerned, by\r\nprojecting bristle-like hairs (_B_). Small animals, such as water-fleas\r\n(_Daphnia_), species of _Cyclops_, and Ostracods, can swim in between\r\nthe bristles, and they then come in contact with a valve which opens\r\neasily inwards (_B_, _kl_) and allows them to penetrate into the\r\ninterior of the trap. Once inside they are captives, for the valve\r\ndoes not open outwards; therefore they soon die and decompose, and are\r\nthen taken up by special absorptive cells (_B_, _C_, _sz_) and utilized\r\nas nourishment for the plants. In this way the Utriculariæ catch\r\nnumerous little crustaceans and insect larvæ, which slip into their\r\ntraps, presumably for concealment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Pitcher of _Nepenthes villosa_, after Kerner.\r\n_St_, stalk of the leaf. _Spr_, its apex. _Fk_, the pitcher. _R_, the\r\nmargin beset with incurved spines.]\r\n\r\nAnother example is found in the marsh plants of the genus _Nepenthes_,\r\nsome species of which live as climbers on the outskirts of tropical\r\nforests, climbing up the trees and letting their long, thin tendrils\r\nhang downwards, often over ponds and stagnant pools, where swarms of\r\nsmall flying insects abound. These plants have developed exceedingly\r\nremarkable contrivances for catching insects and using them as food\r\n(Fig. 24). The long stalks (_St_) of their leaves (_Spr_) are first\r\nbent downwards, then they suddenly turn sharply upwards, and the\r\nupturned portion is modified into a pitcher-like structure, in the\r\nbottom of which a fluid gathers, acid in taste, containing pepsin,\r\nand therefore a digestive fluid. Nitrogenous substances, such as\r\nflesh, dissolve in this fluid, and insects which fall into the pitcher\r\nfrom the rim are killed and dissolved. There are many species of\r\n_Nepenthes_, but not all of them possess the trap-structure in equal\r\nperfection, so that we are able, to some extent, to follow the course\r\nof its evolution, from a broad leaf-stalk, somewhat bent over at the\r\nedges, to the marvellous closed pitcher shown by _Nepenthes villosa_\r\n(Fig. 24) of Borneo. In this species the pitchers attain a length of\r\nfifty centimetres, and are beautifully coloured, resembling in that\r\nrespect, as well as in their form, the tobacco-pipe-like flowers of\r\nthe tropical Aristolochiæ. When we come to discuss the origin of\r\nflowers, we shall see that the bright, conspicuous colour possesses\r\na very considerable value in attracting insects; and in the case of\r\nthe pitcher-plant, too, the gorgeous colour probably allures insects\r\nto settle on the rim of the pitcher, and they are tempted to dally\r\nthe longer since it secretes honey. But the thick, swollen rim of the\r\npitcher is as smooth as if it were made of polished wax, and resembles\r\nthe petals of those magnificent large orchids, the Stanhopeæ; the\r\ninner surface of the pitcher below the margin is also smooth, so that\r\ninsects which creep about seeking honey are apt to slip and fall to the\r\nbottom. Even if many of them are not at once killed by the digestive\r\nfluid, but are able to climb up the smooth wall again, they cannot\r\nescape, for beneath the swollen rim, which projects inwards, there is a\r\ncircle of strong bristles or teeth, with the points directed downwards,\r\nwhich, like thorns, prevent the captive's escape. Thus the pitchers\r\nof _Nepenthes_ secure and digest a large number of insects, and we\r\ncan easily understand that the plant acquires a considerable amount\r\nof valuable nourishment in this way, for ready-made protoplasm is a\r\nconvenient food to which the plant has to do but little in order to\r\nconvert it into its own particular kind of living matter.\r\n\r\nThe toothwort (_Lathræa squamaria_) must also be briefly noticed\r\nhere, because it does not catch insects through the medium either of\r\nair or of water, but through the earth. As is well known, this plant\r\nis parasitic on the roots of various foliage-trees. It is of a pale\r\nyellowish colour, and has no green assimilating parts. For such a plant\r\nit must be of particular value to be able to catch animals and to\r\nuse them as food. To this end the short, pale leaves, which surround\r\nthe creeping, underground stem in the form of closely appressed\r\nscales, have been modified into snares for minute animals. The leaves\r\nhave their upper parts recurved downwards, and the edges have grown\r\ntogether, so that only a small opening is left at the base, and this\r\nleads into a system of tunnels. Aphides, rotifers, bear-animalcules,\r\nbut especially springtails (Podurids), creep into these hollow leaves,\r\nare held fast by a sticky secretion, and are dissolved and absorbed.\r\n\r\nAnother example, also indigenous, is that graceful marsh plant, the\r\nbutterwort (_Pinguicula vulgaris_), whose broad, tongue-shaped leaves,\r\narranged in the form of a rosette, have been modified into an insect\r\ntrap by the turning up of their edges, while the middle is deepened\r\ninto a longitudinal groove (Fig. 25). The whole upper surface of the\r\nleaf is covered with an enormous number of little mushroom-shaped\r\nglands (_B_, _C_, _Dr_), which secrete a viscid slime. Insects which\r\nsettle on the leaf stick fast, and as the glands continue to pour out\r\nmore and more slime, while at the same time the edges of the leaf,\r\nstimulated by the struggling of the insect, curl over still farther,\r\nthe victims are drowned in the slime, and ultimately absorbed; for\r\nthis secretion is so powerful that even fragments of cartilage are\r\ndissolved by it in forty-eight hours. Midges and mayflies in particular\r\nfall victims to this plant, which is common in marshy places both in\r\nmountain and plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Butterwort (_Pinguicula vulgaris_). _A_, the\r\nentire plant, showing the incurved margins of the leaves and some\r\ninsects caught by the secretion. _B_, cross-section through a leaf,\r\nenlarged 50 times. _r_, the margin. _Dr_, _Dr_^l, two kinds of glands.\r\n_C_, a portion of the leaf-surface, magnified 180 times.]\r\n\r\nWe must also mention the sundew (_Drosera rotundifolia_), which takes\r\nits name from the seeming dewdrops that sparkle in the sun on the\r\nleaves, or rather on the rounded extremities of long and rather thick\r\ncilia-like hairs which cover the whole upper surface of the leaf. In\r\nreality the apparent dewdrops consist of a sticky, clear, viscid slime,\r\nwhich is secreted by the glandular ends of the pin-shaped hairs or\r\n'tentacles.' Insects which settle on the leaf are caught by the slime,\r\nand in this case also an acid, pepsin-containing fluid is secreted,\r\nwhich gradually effects the digestion of the soluble parts of the\r\ninsect. It is especially noteworthy that it is not only those tentacles\r\nwhich are in contact with the insect that take part in its digestion\r\nand absorption, for all the others gradually alter their position from\r\nthe moment when any nitrogenous body, be it a fragment of flesh or an\r\ninsect, touches any of them. All begin to curve slowly towards the\r\nstimulating object (Fig. 27), so that, after one to three hours, all\r\nthe tentacles have their heads towards it, and collectively pour out\r\ntheir digestive juice upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. The Sundew (_Drosera rotundifolia_), after\r\nKerner.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. A leaf of the Sundew, with half of the\r\ntentacles curved in upon a captured insect; enlarged 4 times.]\r\n\r\nThe sundew grows in marshes, as, for instance, those of the Black\r\nForest, and also on the moss-covered ridges there, and it is easy to\r\nobserve that a leaf often shows not merely a single gnat, midge, or\r\nlittle dragon-fly, but several, sometimes as many as a dozen. In this\r\ncase, again, the value of the arrangement from the point of view of\r\nnourishment can be no inconsiderable one.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the sundew we are obviously face to face with an\r\nexceedingly complex adaptation, for not only is there a secretion of\r\nthe peculiar digestive juices, which occur only in carnivorous plants,\r\nbut the secreting tentacles are actively motile. That the tentacles\r\nmore remote from the captive may be excited to curve towards it, it is\r\nnecessary that the stimulus exerted by it on the heads of the tentacles\r\nconnected with it be conveyed to the base, and thence to the tips of\r\nthe other tentacles, for they curve throughout their whole length.\r\nThe utility of the contrivance is obvious, but that an arrangement so\r\ndivergent from the ordinary dispositions of plants could be brought\r\nabout points to the length of time that the processes of natural\r\nselection must have gone on, preserving every new little variation, and\r\nadding it to the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Leaf of Venus Fly-trap (_Dionæa muscipula_),\r\nafter Kerner. _A_, leaf-blade (_Spr_) open. _St_, leaf-stalk. _Stch_,\r\nsensitive hairs. _B_, vertical section through the closed leaf-blade.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. _Aldrovandia vesiculosa_, a branch with the\r\ntraps _FA_.]\r\n\r\nTwo plants remain to be noticed in conclusion, both possessing movable,\r\nclosing traps for catching animals. The so-called Venus fly-trap\r\n(_Dionæa muscipula_) is a marsh plant of North America, the leaves of\r\nwhich, like those of _Pinguicula_ and _Drosera_, are arranged in a\r\nrosette on the ground. The individual leaf has a spatula-like stalk\r\nand a blade in two halves (Fig. 28, _A_), each edged with long and\r\nstrong spinous processes, directed obliquely inwards. The halves of\r\nthe blade, when the necessary stimulus is applied to the surface, can\r\nclose together in a very short time, from 10 to 30 seconds. The two\r\nrows of marginal spines then cross, as the interlocking fingers of\r\nthe hands do, and thus form a cage out of which the imprisoned insect\r\ncannot escape. The appropriate stimulus to set the mechanism in motion\r\nis a light touch, while a more violent shock, or strong pressure,\r\nor a current of air, does not cause the trap to close. But if a fly\r\ncomes to creep about on the leaf, and in doing so touches one of six\r\nshort jointed hairs rising erect from a minute cushion of cells, then\r\nthe leaf closes, quickly indeed, but at the same time so gently and\r\nimperceptibly that the fly is unaware of danger and does not try to\r\nescape. Then numerous purple mucous glands begin to surround the victim\r\nwith pepsin-containing, acid, digestive juice which gradually dissolves\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne of the water-plants of Southern Europe, _Aldrovandia vesiculosa_,\r\nwhich is also to be found in swamps on the northern ridge of the\r\nAlps, possesses, in addition to the capturing and digesting apparatus\r\nproper, an active motile apparatus, which is set in motion through\r\nsensitive hairs. When I found the plant for the first time in a swamp\r\nat Lindau, on the Lake of Constance, I took it at first sight for an\r\n_Utricularia_, for the two plants resemble each other in external\r\nappearance (cf. Figs. 22 and 29), but the modification of the leaves\r\ninto traps is quite different. On both halves of the leaf-blade there\r\nare numerous bristles (Fig. 30, _A_), and the lightest touch on these\r\nby a little water animal acts as a releasing stimulus to the motile\r\nelements of the leaf (_Stch_). As in the Venus fly-trap, the two halves\r\nof the leaf close together somewhat quickly, but quite quietly, and the\r\nanimal is caught. Fig. 30 shows a section of one of these traps in its\r\nclosed state. The captive animals cannot escape, because the margins of\r\nthe leaf shut quite tightly on one another, and are beset with little\r\nteeth. Numerous little glands (_Dr_) secrete a digestive juice, and\r\nafter some days, or even weeks, the insoluble remains of the minute\r\nanimals may be found inside the trap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. _Aldrovandia_: its trap apparatus. _A_, open.\r\n_St_, stalk of the leaf. _Spr_, blade of the leaf. _Stch_, sensitive\r\nbristles. _Dr_, glands. _B_, closed, a cross-section.]\r\n\r\nMany more cases of animal-catching plants might be adduced, but\r\nit is far from my intention to try to describe all the existing\r\ncontrivances; those already mentioned may suffice to give an idea of\r\nthe diversity and of the detailed effectiveness of these adaptations.\r\nThey amplify--so it seems to me--our conception of the scope of natural\r\nselection, by showing us that adaptations may arise which are quite\r\nforeign to the original mode of life of the organism in question,\r\nand stand, indeed, in apparent contradiction to its fundamental\r\nphysiological processes. It is hardly necessary to enter into a\r\nspecial argument to show that they can only have been brought about\r\nin the course of natural selection, since every other interpretation\r\nof their occurrence fails. Neither climatic nor any other external\r\ndirect influence could have effected these modifications of the parts\r\nof plants, which are all so different, yet all so well suited to\r\ntheir purpose; they are different even in plants growing quite close\r\ntogether, like the sundew and the butterwort. The Lamarckian principle\r\nof use and disuse hardly enters into the question at all, since plants\r\ndo not possess a will, and we can hardly speak of 'chance' where we\r\nhave to do with such complex and diversely combined transformations.\r\nA process of selection actually operative in each of these cases can\r\neasily be thought out, and I shall leave it to my readers themselves\r\nto do this, and shall only indicate that we have to do with increasing\r\nelaboration in two different directions: first, improvements in the\r\nability to utilize animal substances which happened to stick to the\r\nleaves, and second, an increase in the probability of animals sticking\r\nto the leaves, and so becoming available. Thus there arose, on the one\r\nhand, dissolving and digestive juices, and arrangements for absorption;\r\nand, on the other hand, viscid slime, and traps of various kinds to\r\nsecure the animals, as well as honey and bright colours to attract them.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely transformations in the form of the stems and\r\nleaves which have come about; there are also important physiological\r\nchanges. The sensitiveness to stimulus of various parts of the leaf is\r\ngreatly increased, to a certain extent in the butterwort, the edges of\r\nwhose leaves turn inwards in response to stimulus, still more in the\r\nsundew, in which the stimulus is conveyed from the tentacles touched to\r\nall the others, but most wonderfully of all in the Venus fly-trap and\r\n_Aldrovandia_, whose sensitive hairs so transmit the stimulus that the\r\nwhole leaf is affected by it, and is set in motion, in a manner quite\r\ncomparable to the effects of a nerve-stimulus in animals.\r\n\r\nThus the case of carnivorous or insectivorous plants shows us that,\r\nin the course of natural selection, quite new organs can be produced\r\nin a plant by a thoroughgoing transformation of old ones, as, for\r\ninstance, the pitchers of _Nepenthes_, and that, furthermore, even\r\nthe physiological capacities of the plant may be changed in the most\r\nfar-reaching manner, increasing and varying until they come to resemble\r\nthe functions of the animal body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE VIII\r\n\r\nTHE INSTINCTS OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n The robber-wasp--Statement of the problem--Material basis of\r\n instincts--Instincts are not 'inherited habits'--Instinct of\r\n self-preservation--Fugitive instinct: death-feigning--Masking\r\n of crabs--Nutritive instinct--Monophagous caterpillars--Diverse\r\n modes of acquiring food: May-flies, sea-cucumbers, fishes that\r\n snare--'Aberration' of instinct--Change of instinct during\r\n metamorphosis: Eristalis, Sitaris--Imperfection of adaptation points\r\n to origin through natural selection--Instinct and will--Instincts and\r\n protective coloration--Leisurely flight of Heliconiidæ--Rapid flight\r\n of Papilionidæ--Instincts which act only once in a lifetime--Pupation\r\n of butterflies--Pupation of the Longicorns--Pupation of the\r\n silk-moth--The emperor moth--The cocoons of Atlas--Oviposition of\r\n butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have hitherto considered animals with especial regard to the\r\nvariation and re-adaptation of morphological characters, e.g.\r\nmodifications of form and colour; and we have now to ask whether their\r\nbehaviour also is to be referred as to its origin, in whole or in\r\npart, to the principle of selection. All around us we can see that\r\nanimals know how to use their parts or organs in a purposeful manner:\r\nthe duckling swims at once upon the water; the chicken which has just\r\nbeen hatched from the egg pecks at the seeds lying on the ground; the\r\nbutterfly but newly emerged from the pupa, as soon as its wings have\r\ndried and hardened, knows how to use them in flight; and the predatory\r\nwasp requires no instruction to recognize her victim, a particular\r\ncaterpillar, a grasshopper, or some other definite insect; she knows\r\nhow to attack it, to paralyse it by stings, and then hesitates not\r\na moment as to what she has to do next; she drags it to her nest,\r\ndeposits it in one of the cells already prepared for her future brood,\r\nlays a single egg upon it, and roofs the cell carefully over. It is\r\nonly because all these complex acts are so precisely performed, as\r\nprecisely as if the wasp knew why she performed them, that the species\r\nis able to maintain its existence, for only thus can the rearing of the\r\nnext generation be secured. Out of the egg there slips a little larva,\r\nwhich at once makes for the paralysed victim, feeds upon it, and grows\r\nthereby, then, within the shelter of the closed cell, passes through\r\nthe pupa stage and is transformed into a perfect wasp. Many species\r\nof these predatory wasps do not lay the egg directly beside or upon\r\ntheir prey, but lest its movements should endanger their offspring,\r\nthey hang the egg above it by a silken thread. It is thus in security,\r\nand the young larva, too, when it appears, can withdraw to its safely\r\nswinging resting-place as soon as danger threatens from the convulsive\r\nstruggles of the unfortunate victim at whose body it is gnawing.\r\n\r\nEvery animal has a great many such 'instincts,' which lead it, indeed\r\nforce it, to act appropriately towards an end, without having any\r\nconsciousness of that end. For how should the butterfly know what\r\nflying is, or that it possessed the power of flight at all, or who\r\ncould have shown the predatory wasp, when she wakened from the pupa\r\nsleep to quite a new kind of life, all that she had to do in order to\r\nprocure food for herself and to secure shelter and nourishment for\r\nthe brood which was still enclosed within her ovary? Since species\r\nhave developed from other species, these regulators of the body, the\r\ninstincts, cannot have been the same in earlier times; they must have\r\nevolved out of the instincts of ancestors, and the questions we have to\r\nask are: By what factors? In what way? Has the principle of selection\r\nbeen operative here too, or can we refer instincts to the inherited\r\neffects of use and disuse?\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon this question it is necessary to consider for a\r\nlittle the physiological basis of instinct. We can distinguish three\r\nkinds of actions: purely reflex, purely instinctive, and purely\r\nconscious actions. In the case of the first, we see most clearly that\r\nthey depend on an existing mechanism, for they follow of necessity on\r\na particular stimulus, and cannot always be suppressed. Bright light\r\nstriking our eye makes the pupil narrower by a contraction of the iris,\r\nand in the same way our eyelids close if a finger be thrust suddenly\r\ntowards them. We know, too, the principle of these reflex mechanisms;\r\nthey depend on nerve connexions. Sensory nerves are so connected in the\r\nnerve-centres with motor nerves, that a stimulus affecting the former\r\nat the periphery of the body, as at the eye, is carried to certain\r\nnerve-cells of the brain, and from these it excites to activity certain\r\nmotor centres, so that definite movements are set up. It is rarely\r\nonly one muscle that is thus excited to activity, there are usually\r\nseveral, and here we have the transition to instinctive action, which\r\nconsists in a longer or shorter series of actions, that is, of motor\r\ncombinations. These, too, are originally, at least, set a-going by a\r\nsense impression, an external stimulus which affects a sensory nerve\r\nexactly in the same way as in the reflex mechanism, and this stimulus\r\nis carried to a particular group of sensory nerve-cells in the central\r\nnervous organ, and from these transmitted by very fine inter-connexions\r\nto motor centres. There are extraordinarily complex instinctive\r\nactions, and in these the completion of one action is obviously the\r\nstimulus to the second, the completion of the second to the third, and\r\nso on, until the entire chain of inter-dependent movements which make\r\nup the whole performance has been completed.\r\n\r\nInstincts have thus a material basis in the cells and fibres of\r\nthe nervous system, and through variations in the connexions and\r\nirritability of these nervous parts they too can be modified, like any\r\nof the other characters of the body, such as form and colour.\r\n\r\nConscious actions depend directly on the will, and they have a close\r\nconnexion with instinctive actions in as far as these also can be\r\ncontrolled by the will, that is, can be set a-going or inhibited, and\r\nalso, on the other hand, in as far as purely voluntary actions may\r\nbecome instinctive through frequent repetition. The first case is\r\nillustrated, for instance, when the suckling of a child at the mother's\r\nbreast is continued into the second year of life, as not infrequently\r\nhappens in the southern countries of Europe. Such a child knows exactly\r\nwhy it wants the breast, and its action is a conscious one, while the\r\nnewborn child seeks about with the mouth instinctively, and when it has\r\nfound what it sought performs the somewhat complex sucking movements\r\nautomatically. The second case is illustrated, when, for instance, we\r\nhave made a habit of winding up a watch on going to bed, and do it when\r\nwe happen to change our clothes through the day, although it is then\r\npurposeless and would have been omitted if the action had required\r\na conscious effort of will. One can often observe on oneself in how\r\nshort a time a conscious action may become instinctive. I once sent my\r\nkeyless watch to a watchmaker for repairs, and received from him for\r\nthe time an ordinary watch, which had to be wound with a key, which\r\nkey I kept for safety in my purse. At the end of eight days I got\r\nback my own watch, and on undressing the first night I found myself\r\n'instinctively' taking my purse from my pocket in order to get the key,\r\nwhich, as I very well knew, I no longer needed. And that a long series\r\nof complex movements, originally performed only consciously, may be\r\ngone through instinctively, is shown by the fact that pieces of music\r\nwhich have been learnt by heart can often be played without mistake\r\nfrom beginning to end while the player is thinking of quite other\r\nthings. The complex instinctive actions of animals are performed in\r\nquite a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThere is thus no sharp boundary line between reflex and instinctive\r\nactions, nor between instinctive and conscious actions, but one passes\r\nover into the other, and the thought suggests itself, that in the\r\nphyletic development also transitions from one kind of action to the\r\nother must have taken place. As long as one believes the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple to be really operative one can suppose that actions, which\r\nwere originally dependent on the will, when they were often repeated,\r\nbecame instinctive, or, in other words, that instincts, many of them at\r\nleast, are inherited habits.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavour to show later on that this assumption, plausible as\r\nit seems at first sight, cannot be correct; but in the meantime I must\r\nconfine myself to saying that there are a great number of instincts\r\nwhich must be referred to the process of selection, and that the rest\r\ncan be similarly interpreted in their essentials at least.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of self-preservation is universally distributed, and it\r\nis exhibited in many animals by flight from their enemies. The hare\r\nflees from the fox and from men; the bird flies away at the approach of\r\nthe cat; the butterfly flies from even the shadow of the net spread to\r\ncatch it. These might be regarded as purely conscious actions, and in\r\nthe case of the hare and the bird experience and will have undoubtedly\r\nsome part in them, but even in these the basis of the action is an\r\norganic impulse; this, and not reflection, causes the animal to flee\r\nat sight of an enemy. In the butterfly, indeed, this must be purely\r\ninstinctive, since it is done with the same precision immediately on\r\nleaving the pupa state, before the animal has had any experience. But\r\neven in the case of the hare and the bird, taking to flight would in\r\nmost cases come too late if reflection were necessary first; if it is\r\nto be effective it must take place as instantaneously as the shutting\r\nof the lids when danger threatens the eye.\r\n\r\nThe hermit-crab (Fig. 34, p. 163), which conceals its soft abdomen\r\nin an empty mollusc shell, and drags that about with it on the floor\r\nof the sea, withdraws with lightning-like rapidity into its house\r\nas soon as any suspicious movement catches its eye, and it is very\r\ndifficult to grip one of its legs with the forceps in time to draw it\r\nout of its shell. The same is the case with the so-called Serpulids,\r\nworms of the genus _Serpula_, and its allies; it is not easy to seize\r\nthem, because, however quick one is with the forceps, their instinct\r\nof fugitive self-preservation acts more quickly still, and they shoot\r\nback into their protecting tubes before one has had time to grasp them.\r\nBut this impulse to flee from enemies, though it seems almost a matter\r\nof course, is by no means common to all animals, for in quite a large\r\nnumber the instinct of self-preservation finds expression in an exactly\r\ncontrary manner, namely, in the so-called 'death-feigning,' that is,\r\nremaining absolutely motionless in a definite position precisely\r\nprescribed to the animal by its instinct. In speaking of protective\r\ncolouring, I drew attention to the 'wood-moth' (_Xylina_), which\r\nresembles a broken fragment of half-decayed wood so deceptively, and\r\nI pointed out that the colour-resemblance to wood would be in itself\r\nof but little use to the insect if it were not combined with the\r\ninstinct to remain motionless in danger, to 'feign death.' The antennæ\r\nand legs are drawn close to the body, so that they rather heighten\r\nthe disguise, and, instead of running away, the insect does not move\r\na muscle until the danger is past. This instinct must have evolved\r\nhand in hand with the resemblance to a piece of wood, and, just as\r\nwe sought to interpret the latter from the fact that the moths which\r\nmost resembled the wood had always the best chance of surviving, so we\r\nmaintain that those moths would profit most by their resemblance which\r\ndrew in their legs and antennæ closely and lay most perfectly still.\r\nThus the brain-mechanism, which effected the keeping still whenever the\r\nsenses announced danger, would be more and more firmly established and\r\nperfected in the course of selection.\r\n\r\nEven nearly related animals may have quite different instincts\r\nwhich secure them against danger. Thus in the group of pocket crabs\r\n(Notopoda) there are some species which run away when danger threatens,\r\nbut others which anticipate the risk of discovery by masking themselves\r\nto a certain extent. With the last pair of legs they hold over\r\nthemselves a large piece of sponge, which then grows till it often\r\nleaves only the limbs and frontal region uncovered. Of course there\r\ncan be no question of consciousness in what the crab does, as is\r\nproved by the fact that these crabs will, in case of necessity, take a\r\ntransparent piece of glass instead of the sponge; but the impulse to\r\ncover themselves with something is strong in them, and finds expression\r\nnot only when they see a really protective substance, but even when\r\nthey see one which is transparent and therefore wholly useless for the\r\npurpose. Crabs from which the sponge has been taken away wander about\r\nuntil they find another; the impulse is thus set up not only by the\r\nsight of the sponge or of a stone, but also by the feeling that their\r\nback is uncovered. The large spider-crab of the Mediterranean (_Maja\r\nsquinado_) effects its disguise in a somewhat different manner. It has\r\npeculiar hooked bristles on the back, and on these it hooks little\r\nbunches of seaweed, often many of them, so that it is entirely covered\r\nand looks like a bunch of wrack rather than like an animal. Here again\r\na bodily variation has gone hand in hand with the development of the\r\ninstinct to cover itself: the bristles of the back have become hooked.\r\nMany instincts are accompanied by structural modifications, and in the\r\ncrabs which cover themselves with sponge or stone this is the case, for\r\nthe last pair of thoracic legs is turned towards the back, instead\r\nof being set at the side of the body, as is usual among crabs. They\r\nare thus enabled to hold the sponge much better and more permanently,\r\nand as this is advantageous we may well ascribe the change to natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to another category of instincts, the\r\nmost common and most indispensable of all, those which lead to the\r\nseeking and devouring of food.\r\n\r\nThe chicken just emerged from the egg picks up the seeds thrown to it\r\nwith no experience of what eating is, or what can be made to serve it\r\nas food; its instinct for food expresses itself in picking up, and it\r\nis awakened or stimulated to action by sight of the seeds. As Lloyd\r\nMorgan in his excellent book on _Habit and Instinct_ well says, 'It\r\ndoes not pick at the seeds because instinct says to it that this is\r\nsomething to be picked up and tested, but because it cannot do anything\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\nIn the same way the instinct to seek for food wakes in the kitten at\r\nthe sight of a mouse. I once set before a kitten which had never seen\r\na mouse a living one in a trap. The kitten became greatly excited, and\r\nwhen I opened the trap and let the mouse run away she overtook and\r\ncaught it in a few bounds. The instinct in this case does not express\r\nitself as in the chicken by the rapid lowering of the head and seizing\r\nthe food, but in quite a different combination of movements, in running\r\nafter and grasping the fleeing victim. But that is not all that is\r\nincluded in the instinctive action in the case of the cat, for there\r\nis also the whole wild and gruesome play, the familiar letting go and\r\ncatching again, the passionate growling of satisfaction which, in its\r\nwildness, reminds us much more of a blood-thirsty tiger than of a tame\r\ndomestic animal.\r\n\r\nAs the egg-laying instinct of the female butterfly is excited only by\r\nthe sight and odour of a particular plant, so also is the food instinct\r\nof the caterpillar. If we put a silkworm caterpillar (_Bombyx mori_)\r\njust out of the egg upon a mulberry leaf it will soon begin to gnaw at\r\nit; but put it on a beech leaf or on that of any other indigenous tree,\r\nshrub, or herb and it will not touch it, but simply die of hunger.\r\nAnd yet it could quite well eat many of these leaves, and thrive on\r\nthem too, but the smell and perhaps also the sight of them is not the\r\nappropriate stimulus to liberate the instinct of eating. There are\r\nmany species of caterpillar which are 'monophagous,' that is to say,\r\nrestricted to a single species of plant in a country. One may ask how\r\nsuch a restriction of the liberating stimulus to a single species\r\ncould have been brought about by natural selection, since it could not\r\npossibly be advantageous to be so much restricted in food. The answer\r\nto this will be found in the following facts. On the Belladonna plant\r\nthere lives a little beetle whose feeding instinct is aroused by this\r\nplant alone. But as _Atropa belladonna_ is avoided entirely by other\r\nanimals on account of its poisonousness, this beetle is, so to speak,\r\nsole proprietor of the Belladonna; no other species disputes its food,\r\nand in this there must assuredly be a great advantage, as soon as the\r\nother instincts, above all that of egg-laying, are so regulated as to\r\nsecure that the larva shall have access to its food-plant; and this\r\nis the case. The monophagy of many caterpillars is to be understood\r\nin the same way; it is an adaptation to a plant otherwise little\r\nsought after, and it is combined with a more or less complete loss\r\nof sensitiveness to the stimulus of other plants. The establishment\r\nof such a specialized food-instinct depends on its utility, and has\r\nresulted from the preference given, through natural selection, to those\r\nindividuals in which the food-instinct responded to the stimulus of\r\nthe smallest possible number of plants, and at the same time to those\r\nwhich showed themselves best adapted to a plant especially favourable\r\nto their kind, whose food-instinct was not only most strongly excited\r\nby this one plant, but also whose stomach and general metabolism made\r\nthe best use of it. So we understand why so many caterpillars live\r\non poisonous plants, not only some of our indigenous Sphingidæ, like\r\n_Deilephila euphorbiæ_, but whole groups of tropical Papilionidæ,\r\nDanaides, Acræides, and Heliconiidæ. With this again is connected the\r\npoisonousness or nauseousness of these butterflies.\r\n\r\nHow diversely the instinct to procure food may be developed in one and\r\nthe same group of animals is shown by the fact that not infrequently\r\nplant-eating, saphrophytic, and flesh-eating animals occur in a single\r\ngroup of organisms, as, for instance, in the order of water-fleas or\r\nDaphnidae, or in the class of Infusorians. Many species find their\r\nfood by making an eddy in the water, which brings a stream towards the\r\nmouth, and with it all sorts of vegetable or dead particles; others\r\nlive by preying upon other animals like themselves.\r\n\r\nBut even when the food-instinct in all the species of a group is\r\ndirected towards living prey, the procuring of it may be achieved by\r\nmeans of quite different instincts. Such finer graduations of the\r\nfood-instinct are found not infrequently within quite small groups of\r\nanimals, as in the Ephemeridæ or Day-flies. All their larvæ live by\r\npreying on other animals, but those of one family, represented by the\r\ngenus _Chloëon_, seek to secure their victims by agility and speed,\r\nwhile the larvæ of the second family, with the typical genus _Baëtis_,\r\nhave the instinct to press their smooth broad bodies, with large-eyed\r\nhead, close to the brook pebbles on which they sit. They are exactly\r\nlike these in colour, and thus they lurk almost invisible, until a\r\nvictim comes within their reach, when they throw themselves upon it\r\nwith a bound. The third group, with the typical genus _Ephemera_,\r\nfollows its instinct to dig deep tubes in the mud at the bottom of\r\nthe water, and to lurk in these for their prey. We have thus within\r\nthis small group of Day-flies three distinct modifications of the\r\nfood-instinct, which differ essentially from one another, are made\r\nup of quite different combinations of actions, and, consequently,\r\nmust have their foundation in essentially different directive\r\nbrain-mechanisms. All these cases have only one feature in common; the\r\nanimals all throw themselves upon their prey as soon as they are near\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Sea-cucumber (_Cucumaria_), with expanded\r\ntentacles (_a_), and protruded tube-feet (_b_); after Ludwig.]\r\n\r\nBut even this common feature is not everywhere part of the\r\nfood-instinct. The sea-cucumber (_Cucumaria_) (Fig. 31), according to\r\nthe observations made on it by Eisig in the Aquarium of the Zoological\r\nStation at Naples, gets its food in the following manner. The animal\r\nsits half or entirely erect on a projecting piece of rock and unfolds\r\nits ten tree-like tentacles which surround the mouth. These are\r\nbranched, and have quite the effect of little tufts of seaweed. They\r\nare probably taken for such by many minute animals; for larvæ of all\r\nkinds, Infusorians, Rotifers and worms settle down on them. But the\r\nsea-cucumber bends inwards first one tentacle and then another, so\r\nslowly as barely to be noticeable, brings the point to its mouth, lets\r\nit glide gradually deeper into the gullet, until the whole tentacle is\r\nwithin, and after a time draws it out again equally slowly and unfolds\r\nit anew. Obviously it wipes the tentacle inside the gullet, and retains\r\neverything living that was upon it. This performance is repeated\r\ncontinually, day and night, and it is usually the only externally\r\nvisible sign of life which the animal displays.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable instinct is associated with a structural peculiarity,\r\nfor without the arborescent tentacles the fishing would not be nearly\r\nso successful. Other sea-cucumbers or Holothurians have different\r\ntentacles, and use them in quite a different manner, filling the mouth\r\nwith mud by means of them.\r\n\r\nVery frequently, indeed, there are visible structural changes\r\nassociated with the modified food-instinct. Most predatory fishes chase\r\ntheir prey, like the pike, the perch, and the shark, but there are also\r\nlurkers, and these show in addition to the lurking instinct certain\r\ndefinite bodily adaptations, without which this instinct could not have\r\nsuch full play.\r\n\r\nThus in a marine fish known as the 'star-gazer' (_Uranoscopus_) the\r\neyes are situated not on the sides but on the top of the head, and the\r\nmouth is also directed upwards. Its instinct leads it to bury itself in\r\nthe sand so that only the eyes are uncovered. It lies in wait in this\r\nway until a suitable victim comes within reach, and then snaps at it\r\nwith a sudden movement. But it also possesses a decoying organ, a soft\r\nworm-shaped flap, which it protrudes from the mouth as soon as little\r\nfishes draw near. They make for this bait, and are thus caught.\r\n\r\nSuch ingenious fishing, which is quite suggestive of the human method\r\nof catching trout with artificial bait, occurs in many predatory\r\nfishes; but in every case the fish acts instinctively, without\r\nreflection, on becoming aware of approaching prey. The suitability of\r\nthe action to the end does not depend upon consciousness of the end,\r\nor upon reflection, but is a purely mechanical action, performed in\r\nresponse to the stimulus of a sense-impression.\r\n\r\nThis is best shown by the fact that the instincts may lead their\r\npossessors astray, which always happens when an animal is transferred\r\nto an unnatural situation, to which its instincts are not adapted, so\r\nto speak. The mole-cricket, which is in the habit of escaping pursuit\r\nby burrowing in the earth, makes violent motions with the forelegs,\r\neven if it be placed upon a plate of glass into which it could not\r\npossibly burrow; an ant-lion (_Myrmeleo_), whose instinct impels\r\nit to bore into loose sand by pushing backwards with the abdomen,\r\ngoes backwards on a plate of glass as soon as danger threatens, and\r\nendeavours, with the utmost exertions, to bore into it. It knows no\r\nother mode of flight, and its intellect is much too weak to suggest any\r\nnovel mode. Even the mode of escape most universal among animals, that\r\nof simply running away, does not occur to it; it acts as it must in\r\naccordance with its inborn instinct; it cannot do otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe change of instincts in the different stages of development of\r\none and the same animal have always seemed to me very remarkable; for\r\ninstance, the change of the food-instinct in the caterpillar and the\r\nbutterfly, where the food-instinct is liberated in the caterpillar\r\nby the leaf of a particular plant, but in the butterfly by the sight\r\nand fragrance of a flower, the nectar of which it sucks. In this case\r\neverything is different in the two stages of development, the whole\r\napparatus for seeking and taking food, as well as the nerve-mechanism\r\nwhich determines these modes of action. And how far apart often are the\r\nstimuli which liberate the instinct! The larva of the flower-visiting,\r\nhoney-sucking _Eristalis tenax_ is the ugly, white, so-called\r\nrat-tailed larva, well described by Réaumur, which lives swimming\r\nin liquid manure, and feeds on that! What complete and far-reaching\r\nchanges, not only in the visible structure, but also in the finer\r\nnervous mechanisms, which we cannot yet verify, must have taken place\r\nin the vicissitudes of time and circumstance during the life-history of\r\nthis insect!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Metamorphosis of _Sitaris humeralis_, an\r\noil-beetle, after Fabre. _a_, first larval form, much enlarged. _b_,\r\nsecond larval form. _c_, resting stage of this larva (so-called\r\n'pseudo-pupa'). _d_, third larval form. _e_, pupa.]\r\n\r\nNot the food-instinct alone, but the instinct of self-preservation,\r\nof mode of motion, in short, every kind of instinct, may vary in the\r\ncourse of an individual life. Let us follow the somewhat complex\r\nlife-history of a beetle of the family of the Blister-beetles or\r\nCantharides, as we learnt it first from Fabre. The female of the\r\nred-shouldered bee-beetle (_Sitaris humeralis_) lays its eggs\r\non the ground in the neighbourhood of the underground nest of a\r\nhoney-gathering burrowing-bee (_Anthophora_). The larvæ, when they\r\nemerge, are agile, six-legged, and furnished with a horny head and\r\nbiting mouth-parts, as well as with a tail-fork for springing (Fig. 32,\r\n_a_). The little animals have at first no food-instinct, or at least\r\nnone manifests itself, but they run about, and as soon as they see a\r\nbee of the genus _Anthophora_ they spring upon it and hide themselves\r\nin its thick, hairy coat. If they have been fortunate the bee is a\r\nfemale, who founds a new colony and builds cells, in each of which she\r\ndeposits some honey and lays an egg upon it. As soon as this has been\r\ndone the _Sitaris_ larva leaves its hiding-place, bites the egg of the\r\nbee open, and gradually eats up the contents. Then it moults, and takes\r\nthe form of a grub with minute feet and imperfect masticating organs;\r\nthe tail-fork, too, is lost, for all these parts are now useless, since\r\nit can obtain liquid nourishment without further change of place, from\r\nthe honey in the cell, in exactly the quantity necessary to its growth.\r\nThen it spends the winter in a hardened, pupa-like skin, and it is\r\nnot till the next year (the third), after another short larval stage\r\n(_d_) and subsequent true pupahood (_e_), that the fully-formed beetle\r\nemerges. This again possesses biting mouth-parts, and eats leaves, and\r\nhas legs to run with and wings to fly with.\r\n\r\nIn this beetle, then, the food-instinct changes three times in the\r\ncourse of its life; first the egg of the bee is the liberating\r\nstimulus, then the honey, and finally leaves. The instinct of moving\r\nabout varies likewise, expressing itself first in running and jumping\r\nand in catching on, then in lying still within the cell, and, lastly,\r\nin flying and running about on bushes and trees.\r\n\r\nWe can well understand that, in the course of innumerable generations\r\nand species of insects, the various stages of development would,\r\nby means of selection, become more and more different from each\r\nother, both structurally and in their instincts, as they adapted\r\nthemselves better to different conditions of life; and thus ultimately\r\ninstincts frequently and markedly divergent have been developed in\r\nthe successive stages of life. No other interpretation is possible;\r\nthrough natural selection alone can we understand even the principle\r\nof such adaptations. An animal can thus very well be compared to a\r\nmachine which is so arranged that it works correctly under all ordinary\r\ncircumstances, that is to say, it performs all the actions necessary to\r\nthe preservation of the individual and of its kind. The parts of the\r\nmachine are fitted together in the best possible way, and work on each\r\nother so ingeniously that, under normal circumstances, a result suited\r\nto the end is achieved. We have seen how precisely the liberating\r\nstimulus for an action may be defined, and this secures a far-reaching\r\nspecialization of instincts. But as every machine can work only with\r\nthe material for which it was constructed, so the instinct can only\r\ncall forth an action effectively adjusted to its end when the animal\r\nis under natural conditions. Its specialization has its limits, and\r\nin this lies the reason of its limited purposiveness. For instance,\r\nif the larva of _Sitaris_ were not impelled by the sight of every\r\nbee to spring on it and cling to it, but only by the _females_, then\r\nmany of them would be saved from the fate that awaits them if they\r\nattach themselves to male bees, which make no nest, or even to other\r\nflying insects, in which case also there is no possibility of further\r\ndevelopment. But both these things happen, although the latter has\r\nnot yet, to my knowledge, been recorded of _Sitaris_, but only of its\r\nrelative, the larva of _Melöe_.\r\n\r\n'Instinct goes astray,' it is often said; but in truth it does not\r\ngo astray, but is only not so highly specialized in relation to the\r\nliberating stimulus of the action as seems to us necessary for perfect\r\npurposiveness. But in this very imperfection there lies, as it seems to\r\nme, another proof that we have to do with the results of a process of\r\nselection, for it is of the very nature of these never to be perfect,\r\nbut only relatively perfect, that is to say, just as perfect as is\r\nnecessary to the maintenance of the species. At the moment at which\r\nthis grade of perfection is reached every possibility of a further\r\nincrease in the effectiveness of adjustment to the end ceases, because\r\nit would then no longer directly further the end. Why, for instance,\r\nshould the liberating stimulus in this case be more highly specialized,\r\nsince enough of the _Sitaris_ larvæ already succeed in attaching\r\nthemselves to female bees? It is not for nothing that the beetles of\r\nthis family are so prolific; what is lacking in the perfection of the\r\ninstinct is made up for by the multitude of young larvæ. A single\r\nfemale of the oil-beetle (_Melöe_) lays several hundred eggs.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the animal as a machine, it must be added that it\r\nis a machine which can be altered in varying degrees, which can be\r\nregulated to work at high or low pressure, slowly or quickly, finely or\r\nroughly. This regulating is the work of the intelligence, the limited\r\n'thinking-power,' which must be ascribed to the higher animals in a\r\nvery considerable degree, but which in the lower animals becomes less\r\nand less apparent, until finally it is unrecognizable. That instinctive\r\nactions can be modified or inhibited by intelligence and will is proved\r\nby any trained beast of prey which masters its hunger and the impulse\r\nto snap at the piece of flesh held before it, because it knows that\r\nif it does not control itself painful blows will be the consequence.\r\nIn a later lecture I shall return to the connexion between will and\r\ninstinct; all that concerns us here is to regard instincts as the\r\noutcome of the processes of selection, and as an indirect proof of the\r\nreality of these.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have already said at least so much must be clear, that\r\nnothing, in principle, stands in the way of referring instincts to\r\nselection, since their very essence is their adaptation to an end, and\r\nsuch purposive changes are precisely those that are preserved in the\r\nstruggle for existence. It might, however, be supposed that in all this\r\nthe principle of use and disuse also had a share, and that without it\r\nno changes in instincts could have come about.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, numerous instincts in considering which this can be\r\nentirely excluded.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier stage we discussed in detail the protective colourings\r\nwhich secure insects, and especially butterflies, from extermination\r\nby their numerous enemies, and it was mentioned that this was always\r\naccompanied by corresponding instincts, without which the protective\r\ncolouring and the deceptive form would have profited nothing, or at any\r\nrate not nearly so much. If the caterpillar of the _Catocala sponsa_,\r\nwhich resembles the bark of an oak so deceptively, did not possess at\r\nthe same time the instinct to creep away from the leaves and hide in\r\nthe clefts of the bark on the trunk of the oak-tree, its disguise would\r\nbe of very little use to it; and if the predatory and grass-coloured\r\npraying mantis was not impelled by instinct to lie in wait among the\r\ngrass for its prey, instead of pursuing it, it would rarely succeed in\r\nseizing any of its victims, because of its somewhat leisurely mode of\r\nmovement. This adaptation of the instincts to the protective colouring\r\nis carried into the most minute and apparently trifling details. Thus\r\ndifferent observers have established the fact that the nauseous,\r\nsometimes even poisonous, butterflies, which are distinguished by their\r\nglaring or sharply contrasted colour-pattern, are all slow fliers.\r\nThis is the case with the Danaides and Euplœides of the Old World and\r\nthe Heliconiides of the New; many of their mimetic imitators also fly\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire how this instinct of fluttering, careless flight has\r\ncome to be, we may leave habit as _primum movens_ out of the question\r\naltogether, for there are no external conditions which could have\r\ninduced the butterfly to take to slower flight than its ancestors\r\nexhibited. That it is now advantageous for it--since it acts as a\r\nsignal of its nauseousness--to be as clearly seen and recognized as\r\npossible can exercise no direct influence on its manner of flight,\r\nsince it knows nothing about it. Even if we assume that individual\r\nvariations cropped up which had an instinct for slower flight, there\r\nwould still, without selection, be no reason why this variation in\r\nparticular should multiply, still less why the originally slight\r\nslowing of the flight should become more marked in the course of\r\ngenerations. On the contrary, the butterflies fly a great deal, just\r\nas all other diurnal butterflies do; they exert their power of flight\r\nas long as the sun shines, and if the exercise of one generation\r\ninfluences the next, they ought to become gradually more capable of\r\nrapid flight. In this case exactly the opposite takes place to what is\r\nascribed to the Lamarckian principle; more constant use must here have\r\nbrought about a diminution of the activity of the relevant parts. It is\r\nquite otherwise when we look at it from the point of view of selection.\r\nThe variants which cropped up by chance with slower flight survived\r\nbecause they were most easily recognized and avoided; they are the most\r\nfrequent survivors; they leave descendants which inherit the slower\r\nflight-instinct, and this goes on increasing in them as long as the\r\nincrease carries any advantage with it. As soon as this ceases to be\r\nthe case the variation comes to a standstill, for it is adapted to the\r\naverage of the conditions at a given time.\r\n\r\nWe may picture to ourselves the thousand kinds of regulations of animal\r\nmovements through instinct as having come about in a similar way; in\r\nthe majority of cases we _must_ picture it thus. For it is only in the\r\ncase of those with high intelligence that we can ask whether the animal\r\ndid not by deliberation help in establishing the purposive variation\r\nin its movements. Among insects in any case this could only be taken\r\ninto account to a very limited extent, although I do not dispute that\r\nthe more intelligent among them may learn, and may make experiments,\r\nand can modify their actions accordingly. But in fleeing from an enemy\r\nexperience has nothing to do with it, for the first time it is caught\r\nit pays the penalty with its life. Without care, and with no idea of\r\nthe dangers surrounding them on all sides, the butterflies float about,\r\nguided only by their instinct, which, however, is so exactly adapted\r\nto the conditions of their life that a sufficient number of them to\r\npreserve the species always happily escapes all the many dangers. I\r\nmay remind you of Hahnel's case of the butterfly, already mentioned,\r\nwhich escaped the agile lizard by flying rapidly up from the sweet\r\nbait, but settled again upon it without fear immediately afterwards, to\r\nfly from the lizard as before, and did so several times in succession.\r\nWe usually judge such actions far too much from the human standpoint;\r\nthe butterfly does not wish to escape the death which threatens it; it\r\nknows nothing about death; it is not with it as it was with Dr. Hahnel\r\nhimself, who when he was once in danger from a jaguar in a thicket\r\nwas so affected by the thought of the death he had happily escaped\r\nthat he never cared to pass the place again, but made a long circuit\r\nto his home. The butterfly does not act according to reflection and\r\nimagination; it flies up with lightning-like rapidity when the lizard\r\nrushes at it, because this rapid movement, which it _sees_, acts as\r\nthe stimulus which liberates the flight-instinct, and this works so\r\npromptly that in most cases the insect is rescued from danger. Its\r\ndisposition, however, is not otherwise affected by its narrow escape,\r\nand it obeys anew the food-instinct which impels it to settle again\r\non the bait, until the flight-instinct is again set a-going by the\r\nvisual impression of the re-advance of the lizard. It is the plaything\r\nof its instincts, a machine which works exactly as it must. That it\r\nis only sense-impressions and not conceptions which here liberate the\r\nactions can be well seen in the case of shy species of butterfly like\r\nour purple emperor (_Apatura iris_), which flies up like lightning from\r\nthe moist wood-paths on which it loves to settle as soon as any rapidly\r\nmoving visual image, even if it be only a shadow, strikes its eyes. For\r\nthis reason the collector tries to approach it so as not to throw his\r\nshadow before him, for then the insect lets the advancing enemy get\r\nquite close, and only flies up when the net is quickly thrust towards\r\nit. In all probability the eye of this insect is particularly well\r\nadapted for perceiving movements, and certainly the flight-instinct\r\nreacts very promptly to such visual impressions, and we can understand\r\nthat it must have been so regulated if, as we assume, the regulation\r\ncame about through processes of selection, for the enemies of the\r\nbutterflies, such as birds, dragon-flies, and lizards shoot quickly\r\nout on their prey, and therefore those butterflies must always have\r\nsurvived whose instinct impelled them to take to flight most quickly.\r\n\r\nIn this, then, as in a thousand other cases, the instinct of flight,\r\nor indeed any other mode of movement, cannot be interpreted as an\r\n'inherited habit,' because there is no evidence of the possession of\r\nthat degree of intelligence which could have induced the variation in\r\nthe previous habit, that is, in manner of movement. The same is true\r\nof animals of low intelligence in regard to all the other instincts,\r\nwhich otherwise might seem to be explicable in terms of the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a whole large group of instincts in regard to\r\nwhich the idea of the Lamarckian principle cannot be entertained, as\r\nI showed years ago, and it consists of all those instincts which are\r\nonly exercised once in the course of a lifetime. These cannot possibly\r\ndepend on practice in an individual lifetime, and transmission of\r\nthe results of this exercise to the following generation; they can\r\ntherefore only be interpreted in terms of selection, unless we are to\r\ngive up all attempts at a scientific interpretation, and simply accept\r\nthem as 'marvels.'\r\n\r\nTo this class belong all the diverse instincts by which insects\r\nprotect themselves against attack during the pupa stage. Even the way\r\nin which the caterpillars of many diurnal butterflies hang themselves\r\nup in pupation is not by any means a very simple instinctive action.\r\nThe caterpillar first spins, in a suitable place, a small round disk\r\nof silk threads, to which it then attaches the posterior end of its\r\nbody, so securely that it cannot be easily torn away. More complicated\r\nstill is the securing of the pupa when it does not hang freely, but\r\nis to remain pressed against a wall or a tree, as is the case in the\r\nPapilionidæ and the Pieridæ. In this case the caterpillar must, in\r\naddition to the usual cradle, spin a thread of silk, in an ingenious\r\nway, diagonally across the thorax, so that it may cross about the\r\nmiddle of the wing rudiments, and not be too loose, lest the pupa fall\r\nout, yet not too tight, lest the thread cut too deeply into the wing\r\nrudiments and hinder their development. When one remembers that it is\r\nthe caterpillar that does all this, before it has taken the form of the\r\npupa, and that it must all be adapted to the pupa's form, we are amazed\r\nat the extraordinary exactness with which instinct prescribes all the\r\nindividual movements which make the whole of the complex performance\r\neffective. And yet, as each caterpillar only accomplishes this\r\nperformance once in its life, it could at no time in the development\r\nof the species have become a habit in the case of any individual\r\ncaterpillar, and it cannot therefore be an 'inherited habit.'\r\n\r\nBut however diverse are the methods of securing the safety of the pupæ\r\nin the different families of butterflies, they must all be referred\r\nback to a single root, if the butterfly pedigree can be traced back to\r\na single ancestral group. The caterpillar of the Sphingidæ does not\r\ncreep up walls and trees when it is ready to enter on the pupa stage,\r\nas so many of the caterpillars of the diurnal butterflies do, but\r\ninstead its instinct compels it to run about on the ground until it has\r\nfound a spot which seems to it suited for boring into the earth, or,\r\nto speak less metaphorically, until it comes to a place which, from\r\nits nature, acts as a liberating stimulus to the instinct to burrow.\r\nThen it penetrates more or less deeply, according to the species, and\r\nmakes a small chamber, which it lines with silken threads to prevent\r\nit collapsing; this done, it moults, and enters on the pupa stage.\r\nThe exactness with which the individual movements are prescribed\r\nby instinct is seen in the way in which the size of the chamber is\r\nregulated so as to be exactly as large as is necessary to give the\r\npupa room enough without leaving any superfluous free space. This is\r\nnot so simple as it seems, and is not directly conditioned by the\r\nsize of the animal, for the caterpillar is longer and altogether of\r\ngreater volume than the pupa. The same thing is seen in the stag-beetle\r\n(_Lucanus cervus_), the largest of our indigenous beetles, which gets\r\nits name from the powerful antler-like jaws which distinguish the male.\r\nIt also undergoes its pupal metamorphosis in the earth, and makes a\r\nlarge hard ball of clay, hollow inside, and as smooth as if polished,\r\nand its cavity is exactly the size of the future pupa, or to speak more\r\nprecisely, of the fully-formed beetle. For, as Rösel von Rosenhof in\r\nhis day 'observed with amazement,' the balls in which the males lie\r\nhave a much longer cavity than those built by the females, and for\r\nthis reason, that when the fully-formed beetle emerges from the pupa\r\nit must, if it is a male, have room to stretch out its horns, which\r\nhave till then lain upon the breast. 'For the beetles do not leave\r\ntheir dwelling-place until all their parts are sufficiently strong and\r\nproperly hardened, and till the season has arrived in which they are\r\nwont to fly about.' The male larva thus makes a much longer pupa-house\r\nthan the female larva, in anticipation, so to speak, of the enormous\r\nsize of the jaws which will grow out later!\r\n\r\nHere the instinct has two modes of expression, according as the bodily\r\nparts are male or female. Here we have to do with an action which is\r\nperformed once in a lifetime, and thus the possibility of any other\r\nexplanation of the origin of this instinct than through natural\r\nselection is excluded.\r\n\r\nNot less significant is the case of the silk-cocoons. The cocoons spun\r\nby the silkworm are egg-shaped, and consist of a single thread many\r\nthousand yards in length, which is wound round the spinning caterpillar\r\nso that not a space is left uncovered. The web is firm, tough, and very\r\ndifficult to tear; therefore we must grant that the pupa resting within\r\nwill enjoy a very considerable degree of security against injury. But\r\nthe moth must be able to get out, and that this may be possible the\r\ncaterpillar is impelled by instinct to make its spinning movements such\r\nthat the cocoon is eventually looser at the anterior end, so that the\r\ninsect, when it is ready to emerge, can tear it asunder with its feet\r\nand make a way out for itself. For this very reason, because the silk\r\nmust be torn and spoilt by the emerging insect, silk-breeders kill the\r\npupating insect before it begins to make its way out.\r\n\r\nBut there are species whose cocoons are provided from the very start\r\nwith an outlet, for the caterpillar spins the silk round itself in\r\nsuch a way that a round opening is left. But this opening would be not\r\nonly a convenient door for the butterfly to emerge by, but an equally\r\nconvenient entrance for all its enemies. It is, therefore, closed up.\r\nIn the case of the 'emperor moth' (_Saturnia carpini_) this is effected\r\nby means of a circle of stiff bristles of silk on the inside (Fig. 33),\r\nthe points of which bend outwards like those of a weir-basket (_r_);\r\nfrom the inside the emerging moth can easily push aside the bristles,\r\nwhile the threatening enemy from without is scared off by the stiff\r\npoints of the bristles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Cocoon of the Emperor Moth (_Saturnia\r\ncarpini_), after Rösel. _A_, enclosed pupa. _B_, emerging moth. _r_,\r\nhedge of bristles. _fl_, wings.]\r\n\r\nSuch a cocoon is comparable to a work of art in which every part\r\nharmonizes with the rest, and all together are adapted as well as\r\npossible to their purpose. And yet it is all accomplished without the\r\ncaterpillar having the remotest conception of what it is aiming at when\r\nit winds the endless silken thread about itself in the artistic and\r\nprecisely prescribed coils. Nor has it any time for trying experiments\r\nor for learning; it must make all the complex bendings and turnings\r\nof the head which spins the thread, and of the anterior part of the\r\nbody which guides the thread, quite exactly and correctly the first\r\ntime if a good cocoon is to be produced. Here every possibility of\r\ninterpreting this instinct as 'an inherited habit' is excluded, for\r\neach caterpillar becomes a pupa only once; and it is just as impossible\r\nto suppose that it can be directed by intelligence, since it can\r\nneither know that it is about to become a pupa, nor that, in the pupa\r\nstage, it will be in danger from enemies which will attempt to force\r\ntheir way into the cocoon, nor that the hedge of bristles will protect\r\nit from such enemies. Our only clue to an interpretation is in the slow\r\nprocess by which minute useful variations in the primitive instinct\r\nof spinning are accumulated through selection; and it is wonderful to\r\nsee how exactly these spinning powers are adapted to the particular\r\nlife-conditions of individual species.\r\n\r\nThus there are several of the Saturnides whose enormous caterpillars\r\nlive on large-leaved trees, and these make use of the large leaves to\r\nform a shelter for the pupa stage, spinning them together so that the\r\ncocoon is for the most part surrounded by leaf. But as the leaf might\r\neasily fall off with the weight of the pupa, they make the leaf-stalk\r\nfast to the twig from which it grows by binding the two firmly together\r\nwith a broad, strong, closely-apposed silken band. Seitz relates of\r\nthe largest of all these spinners, the Chinese _Attacus atlas_, that\r\nthis silk sheath 'is continued to the nearest strong branch, so that\r\nit is impossible with the hand to detach the leaves that conceal an\r\nAtlas-pupa from the tree.' To be sure, this pupa weighs about eleven\r\ngrammes!\r\n\r\nSince instincts vary, as well as the visible parts of an animal, a\r\nfulcrum is afforded by means of which selection can bring about all\r\nthese very special adaptations to given conditions, since it always\r\npreserves for breeding the best suited variations of an already\r\nexisting instinct. Any other interpretation is once more excluded.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of insects and their egg-laying. This, too,\r\nis in many cases only performed once in a lifetime, and the insect\r\ndies before it has seen the fruit of its labour. Yet egg-laying is\r\nperformed in the most effective manner, and with the most perfect\r\nsecurity of result. It seems as if the insect knew, so to speak,\r\nexactly where, in what numbers, and how it should lay its eggs. Many\r\nMayflies (Ephemeridæ) let their eggs fall all at once into the water\r\nin which the larvæ live; many Lepidoptera, such as _Macroglossa\r\nstellatarum_, lay their eggs singly, and on definite plants--the\r\nhumming-bird hawk-moth, just referred to, on _Galium mollugo_; others,\r\nlike _Melitæa cinxia_, lay their eggs in heaps on the leaves of the\r\nway-bread (_Plantago media_), or, like _Aglia tau_, on the bark of a\r\nlarge beech-tree. Nothing in these different modes of egg-laying is\r\ndue to chance or caprice; all is determined and regulated by instinct,\r\nand all, as far as we can see, is as well adapted to its purpose as\r\npossible. When, for instance, _Macroglossa stellatarum_ lays her eggs\r\nsingly, or in twos or threes, on the green leaves of the food-plant, it\r\nthereby obviates the danger of scarcity of food for the comparatively\r\nlarge caterpillars, since not many of them could subsist together on\r\na single plant of Galium, while _Aglia tau_ can place several hundred\r\neggs on the same beech-tree trunk without having to fear that its\r\ncaterpillars will not find abundant nourishment. The precision with\r\nwhich the egg-laying instinct works is even greater in other species\r\nin which there are more special requirements, e.g. when the eggs have\r\nto be laid on the under side of the leaves, as in _Vanessa prorsa_, or\r\nwhere they have to be cemented together in a little pillar, so that\r\nthey bear a deceptive resemblance to the green flower-buds of the\r\nfood-plant (the stinging-nettle).\r\n\r\nIt is certainly astonishing how exactly the stimulus in these cases is\r\nspecialized to the liberation of the instinct. In general the smell\r\nof the food-plant of the caterpillar is enough for most butterflies,\r\nand this attracts the female ready to deposit its eggs, but complete\r\nliberation of the instinct is only effected by the visual impression\r\nof the under side of the leaf. We cannot but be astonished that there\r\nis room for such finely graded nerve-mechanisms in the little brain\r\nof a butterfly, and yet it would be easy enough to adduce still more\r\ncomplex instincts connected with oviposition in insects. The large\r\nwater-beetle, _Hydrophilus piceus_, lays its eggs on a floating raft\r\nmade by itself; the gall-wasps must first pierce with their ovipositor\r\ninto a particular part of a particular plant to be able to lay the\r\neggs in the proper place, and this in no haphazard way but with great\r\ncarefulness and in a perfectly definite manner. But there is no\r\nnecessity to refer here to many or to the most complicated cases of\r\negg-laying; I only wish to show that, even in the simple cases, such\r\nas that of the butterflies just referred to, there is a precisely\r\nregulated combination of actions which is executed mechanically, and\r\nwhich cannot be interpreted as inherited habit, because it never was a\r\nhabit in any individual of any generation.\r\n\r\nIt is thus placed beyond the possibility of doubt that very many\r\ninstincts, at least, must depend on selection, and it would be useless\r\nto go further in this direction by extending our survey to other\r\ngroups of instincts. I shall, however, return later on to the study of\r\ninstincts, and, after we have become acquainted with the main features\r\nof the laws of inheritance, it will then be seen that, even among\r\nhigher animals, instincts can never be interpreted in terms of the\r\nLamarckian principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE IX\r\n\r\nORGANIC PARTNERSHIPS OR SYMBIOSIS\r\n\r\n Hermit-crabs and sea-anemones--Hermit-crabs and hydroid polyps--Fishes\r\n and sea-anemones--Green fresh-water polyps--Green Amœba--Sea-anemones\r\n and yellow Algæ--Cecropia trees and ants--Lichens--Root fungi--Origin\r\n of Symbiosis--Nostoc and Azolla apparently contradict the origin\r\n through natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have already seen, by means of many examples, to what a great degree\r\nanimals and plants are able to adapt themselves to new conditions\r\nof life; how animals imitate their surroundings in colour and form,\r\nhow instincts have varied in all directions, how plants have made\r\nuse of the chance of frequent contact with little animals to obtain\r\nnourishment from them, and have developed contrivances adapted for\r\nbringing as many of these as possible into their power and causing them\r\nto yield them the largest possible amount of food. A great many of\r\nthese could only be interpreted in terms of natural selection, and in\r\nothers it seemed at least very probable that selection was one of the\r\nfactors in bringing them about.\r\n\r\nParticularly clear proof of the reality of natural selection is\r\nafforded by those cases where one form of life associates itself with a\r\nvery different one so intimately that they are dependent on one another\r\nand cannot live without one another--at least in extreme cases--and\r\nthat new organs, and, indeed, new dual organisms, are sometimes\r\nproduced by this interdependence of life. This phenomenon--so-called\r\n'Symbiosis'--was discovered by two sharp-sighted botanists, Anton de\r\nBary and Schwendener. But Symbiosis occurs not only between plants;\r\nit occurs also between plants and animals and between two species\r\nof animal, and we understand by it a life of partnership depending\r\non mutual benefits, so that each of the two species affords some\r\nadvantage to the other, and makes existence easier for it. In this\r\nrespect Symbiosis differs from Parasitism, in which one species is\r\nsimply preyed upon by another without receiving any benefit from it in\r\nreturn, and also from the more innocent Commensalism of Van Beneden,\r\nthe table-companionship in which one species depends for its existence\r\non the richly-spread table of another. Symbiosis is particularly\r\ninteresting, because, in addition to extreme cases with marked\r\nadaptations, many occur which are of great simplicity, and which seem\r\nto have brought about almost no change in the two associated species.\r\n\r\nWe shall take our first examples from the Animal Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe partnership between certain sea-anemones (Actiniæ) and hermit-crabs\r\n(Paguridæ) had been noticed long before any particular attention\r\nwas devoted to it. Many species of hermit-crab frequently carry a\r\nlarge sea-anemone about with them on the mollusc shell which they\r\nuse as a protecting-house; indeed, two or three of these beautiful\r\nmany-tentacled polyps are often attached to them, and this is not at\r\nall a matter of chance, but depends upon instinct on the part of both\r\nanimals; they have the feeling of belonging to each other. If the\r\nsea-anemone be taken away from the hermit-crab and put in a distant\r\npart of the aquarium, the crab seeks about till it finds it, then\r\nseizes it with its claws and sets it on its house again. The instinct\r\nto cover itself with Actiniæ is so strong within it that it loads\r\nitself with as many of these friends as it can procure, sometimes with\r\nmore than there is room for on the shell. The sea-anemone on its part\r\ncalmly submits to the crab's manipulations--a fact very surprising to\r\nany one who is aware of the anemone's ordinarily extreme sensitiveness\r\nto contact, and knows how it immediately draws itself together on any\r\nattempt to detach it from the ground, and will often let itself be\r\ntorn in pieces rather than give way. The mutual instincts of the two\r\ncreatures are thus adapted to each other; but it does not at first\r\nsight seem as if any structural changes had taken place in favour of\r\nthe partnership. This is true, indeed, as regards the hermit-crab, but\r\nnot as regards the sea-anemone, although the nature of the adaptation\r\non the sea-anemone's part only becomes apparent when the two animals\r\nare closely observed in their life together.\r\n\r\nWe owe our understanding of this adaptive change in the sea-anemone,\r\nand, indeed, our knowledge of this whole case of Symbiosis, to the\r\nbeautiful observations of Eisig. Starting from the hypothesis that the\r\nmutual relations could only be the outcome of natural selection, Eisig\r\npointed out that this partnership must offer some advantage not to one\r\npartner only, but to both; otherwise it could not have arisen through\r\nselection. The advantage to the sea-anemone is obvious enough; since of\r\nitself it can only move very slowly, and is usually firmly fixed in one\r\nplace, it is easy to see that it would be useful to it to be carried\r\nabout on the floor of the sea by the hermit-crab, and to get its share\r\nof the hermit-crab's food. But the service yielded to the hermit-crab\r\nby the sea-anemone in return is not nearly so apparent. Eisig made\r\nan observation in the Zoological Station at Naples which solved this\r\nriddle. He saw an octopus attack the hermit-crab and attempt to draw\r\nit out of its shell with the point of one of its eight arms. But before\r\nthis had succeeded there sprang from the body of the sea-anemone a\r\nlarge number of thin worm-like threads which spread over the arm of\r\nthe robber, who immediately let go his hold of the crustacean and\r\ntroubled himself no further with it. These threads, called acontia,\r\nare thickly beset with stinging-cells, which must at least cause a\r\nviolent smarting on the soft skin of the octopus. Thus we see that the\r\nActinia instinctively defends its partner from attacks, and does it so\r\neffectively that we need not wonder how the instinct to provide itself\r\nwith Actiniæ could have arisen in the hermit-crab. But the acontia seem\r\nto have been greatly strengthened in the course of the sea-anemone's\r\nassociation with hermit-crabs, for they do not occur in all forms, and\r\nthey are most highly developed in those which live in Symbiosis with\r\ncrustaceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Hermit-crab (_E_), within a Gasteropod shell,\r\non which a colony of _Podocoryne carnea_ has established itself.\r\nFrom the common root-work (which is not clearly shown) there arise\r\nnumerous nutritive polyps with tentacles (_np_), among which are\r\nsmaller 'blastostyle' polyps with a circle of medusoid buds (_mk_),\r\nspine-like personæ (_stp_), and on the margin of the mollusc shell a\r\nrow of defensive individuals (_wp_). _F_, antennæ. _Au_, eyes of the\r\nhermit-crab; slightly enlarged.]\r\n\r\nIn this case the structural change, the transformation of the\r\nmesenteric filaments that occur in all Actiniæ into projectile\r\nacontia, is comparatively slight, but in another partnership between\r\nhermit-crabs and polyps the latter have undergone a much more marked\r\nadaptation. At Naples _Eupagurus prideauxii_ is one of the commonest\r\nhermit-crabs. It lives at a depth of about a hundred feet, and is\r\noften brought to the Zoological Station by the fishermen in large\r\nquantities. Its borrowed mollusc shell often bears a little polyp,\r\n_Podocoryne carnea_ (Fig. 34), which forms colonies of often several\r\nhundred individuals, arising from a common root-work of stolons which\r\ncovers the shell. The polyp colony is composed of different kinds\r\nof individuals or personæ, illustrating the principle of division\r\nof labour: it includes (1) nutritive persons (_np_) which possess a\r\nproboscis, mouth, and tentacles on their club-shaped bodies; (2) much\r\nsmaller blastostyles (_bl_), that is to say, polyps with degenerate\r\nmouth and tentacles, which are wholly given over to the production\r\nof buds (_mk_), which then develop into sexual animals, little\r\nfree-swimming medusoids; and (3) protective personæ in the form of hard\r\nspines (_stp_), beneath the shelter of which the soft polyps withdraw\r\nwhen the mollusc shell is rocked about on the sea-floor by the rolling\r\nof the waves. In addition to these three different kinds of individuals\r\nor personæ there are also (4) defensive polyps (_wp_) of long,\r\nthread-like shape, thickly set with stinging-cells, but possessing\r\nneither mouth nor tentacles. It might at first be thought that these\r\nare for the defence of the colony, but this is not so; the fact is\r\nthat they rather serve for the direct defence of the hermit-crab.\r\nThis is indicated by the position they occupy in the colony; they are\r\nnot regularly distributed over the surface, but are ranged round the\r\nedge, and, indeed, only on the edge which surrounds the opening of\r\nthe mollusc shell. Here these defensive polyps stand in close array,\r\nsometimes spirally contracted, sometimes hanging loosely down over\r\nthe hermit-crab like a fringe. Their function, like the acontia of\r\nActiniæ, is to defend the crab when an enemy tries to follow it within\r\nthe shelter of its domicile. This can easily be demonstrated by drawing\r\nout the hermit-crab from the Gasteropod shell, and, when the colony has\r\nsettled down again, seizing the shell with the forceps and drawing it\r\nslowly through the water. The water-stream which then flows upon the\r\nshell mimics the attack of an enemy, and immediately all the defensive\r\npolyps, as at a given signal, strike from above downwards, and repeat\r\nthis three or four times; they are scaring off the supposed enemy.\r\n\r\nIn this species of polyp a special form of individual has developed\r\nwith a quite definite position in the colony, and furnished with a\r\nspecial instinct or reflex mechanism which is directly useful only to\r\nthe crab, and has therefore, in a sense, arisen for its advantage. This\r\ncan quite well be explained through natural selection, for indirectly\r\nthese polyps are also of use to the colony, inasmuch as they protect\r\ntheir valuable partner, and thus render it possible for the hydroid\r\ncolony to make the partnership of use to the hermit-crab as well as to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis mutual arrangement thus satisfies the requirement which, from\r\nthe selectionist point of view, must be made in regard to all that is\r\nnew--that it must be useful to its possessor.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked what service the hermit-crab renders to the polyp colony\r\nin return, the answer is that, as in the symbiosis with sea-anemones,\r\nthe hermit-crab carries the polyps to their food, which is also its\r\nown. Hermit-crabs eat all sorts of animal food, living or dead, which\r\nthey find on the sea-floor, and the remains of their meal fall to\r\nthe share of the polyps. Once, without special intention, I laid a\r\nhermit-crab with its polyp colony in a flat vessel of sea-water beside\r\na bright green living sponge. After some time the majority of the\r\npolyps had become bright green; they had filled themselves with the\r\ngreen cells of the sponge.\r\n\r\nI do not know how else we should picture to ourselves the origin\r\nof symbiotic instincts in such lowly animals except through the\r\ntransmission and augmentation of variations in the instincts of the\r\ntwo partners--variations which made their possessors more capable of\r\nsurvival. Mollusc shells, ever since there were any, must have served\r\nas a foundation and point of attachment for polyp colonies; as a\r\nmatter of fact, we find to-day on mollusc shells many kinds of polyp\r\ncolonies which show no special adaptation to a life of partnership\r\nwith hermit-crabs. From such indifferent associations a symbiotic\r\none must gradually have been evolved in some instances, through the\r\npreservation and augmentation of every useful variation, both of\r\ninstincts and reflex actions, as well as of form and structure. I\r\nshall not attempt to trace the course of this evolution in detail, but\r\nit is obvious that the development of defensive polyps, and of their\r\ninstinct to defend the crustacean, can be interpreted neither as due\r\nto any direct influence nor as due to the effect of use, but only to\r\nthe utility of this arrangement, the beginnings of which--polyps with\r\nstinging-cells--were already present. Their augmentation and perfecting\r\nmust be referred entirely to natural selection. It is the same with\r\nadaptations which do not refer directly to the crustacean partner,\r\nbut rather to the disposition of the polyps on the shell. The spinous\r\npersonæ which protect the softer polyps from being crushed by being\r\nrolled about on the pebbles by the waves cannot possibly be regarded\r\nas the direct result of this crushing. But it is obvious that some\r\nsuch colonies must have had among their members some with a stronger\r\nexternal skeleton, and therefore less easily crushed than the rest, and\r\nthis would lead to their more frequent survival.\r\n\r\nNo adaptation seems to have taken place in the hermit-crab in this\r\ncase, but that is probably only apparently the case; the probability\r\nis that it would not tolerate the presence of the polyp-colony on the\r\nshell unless its instinct compelled it thereto, just as its instinct\r\nimpels it to cover itself with sea-anemones, and fearlessly to grasp\r\nthe dangerous animal, which, however, only shows its partner its softer\r\nside. Truly, such transformations of instinct are wonderful enough, but\r\nthat they should have come about through intelligence is here quite\r\ninconceivable; there remains nothing but natural selection.\r\n\r\nA case in which no apparent corporeal adaptations have occurred, but\r\nwhich depends altogether on slight modifications of the instincts, is\r\nafforded by the well-known relations between ants and aphides. These\r\ntwo groups of insects live in a kind of symbiosis, although they are\r\nby no means inseparably connected with each other. Wherever strong\r\ncolonies of aphides cover the young shoots of a plant, such as a\r\nstinging-nettle, a rose, or an elder, we almost always find ants which\r\nwalk cautiously about among the plant-lice, often in great numbers,\r\nstopping now and again to stroke them with their antennæ, and then\r\nlicking up the sweet juice from the intestine which they now give\r\nforth. Darwin showed by experiment that the aphides retain this juice\r\nif no ants are on the spot, and only give it off when ants are put\r\nbeside them. Herein lies the proof that we have again to do with a\r\ncase of modification of instincts. This juice is, of course, not the\r\nsecretion of special glands, as it was still believed to be in Darwin's\r\ntime, and it does not come from the so-called 'honey-tubes' situated on\r\nthe back of the abdomen of the aphides; it is simply their excrement,\r\nwhich is liquid like their food, and the voiding of it has become\r\ninstinctively connected with the presence of the friendly ants.\r\n\r\nThat the aphides are not in any way afraid of the ants implies, in\r\nitself, a modification of their instinct, for these poisonous insects,\r\nprone to biting, are otherwise much dreaded in the insect world.\r\nMoreover, the aphides, harmless as they seem, are not quite without\r\nmeans of defence, although these are never used against the ants.\r\nOther animals which approach them they bespatter with the sticky,\r\noily secretion prepared in the so-called 'honey-tubes' already noted,\r\nsquirting it especially into the eyes of an assailant, so that the\r\nattack is abandoned.\r\n\r\nOf course the aphides have no idea wherein the utility of their\r\nfriendship for the ants consists, but it is not difficult for us to\r\ndiscover it, since the ants, by their mere presence in the aphid\r\ncolony, frighten and keep off their enemies. We see, then, that the\r\nconditions for a process of natural selection are here afforded:\r\nthe instinct to be friendly to the ants is thoroughly useful, and\r\nthe instinct of the ants to seek out the aphides, and, instead of\r\ndevouring them, to 'milk' them, is also advantageous; it must be an\r\nold acquisition, an instinct early developed, for in several species it\r\nhas gone so far that the aphides are carried into the ants' nest, and\r\nare there (as one might say) kept and tended as domesticated animals.\r\n\r\nA pretty case of symbiosis between two animals is reported by\r\nSluiter, and I mention it because it concerns a vertebrate animal,\r\nand intelligence has something to do with it. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Batavia there are frequently to be found on the coral reefs\r\nlarge yellow sea-anemones, with very numerous and comparatively\r\nlong tentacles, and a little brightly-coloured fish, of the genus\r\n_Trachichthys_, makes use of these forests, beset with stinging-cells,\r\nto find security from its enemies. These appear to be numerous, for\r\nin an aquarium, at any rate, the little fish very soon falls a victim\r\nto one or other of them, unless he is supplied with the protective\r\nsea-anemones. When this is the case it swims blithely about among the\r\ntentacles, and the sea-anemone does not sting it; for there has been a\r\nmodification of instinct on its part as well as on that of the fish.\r\nThe advantage it gains from the fish is, that the latter brings large\r\nmorsels of food--in the aquarium, pieces of meat--into the anemone's\r\nmouth. In doing so it tears away fibres for itself, and even if the\r\nActinia has swallowed pieces too quickly, the fish pulls them half out\r\nof the gullet again, and only relinquishes them to be consumed by its\r\npartner when it has satisfied its own appetite. In this case, again,\r\nthe modification of the instinct is the only adaptation which has been\r\nbrought about by the symbiosis, and its origin seems difficult to\r\nunderstand. How can the fish have first formed the habit of putting\r\nits prey into the mouth of the anemone instead of eating it directly?\r\nAlthough in many cases it is difficult to guess at the beginnings of\r\na process of selection, because they are scarcely discoverable in\r\nthe subsequently accumulated variations, yet in this instance we may\r\nperhaps picture them to ourselves in this way: The fish was in the\r\nhabit of letting fall pieces of food which could not be swallowed\r\nwhole, and of diving down upon them repeatedly, to tear off a fragment\r\neach time. As the sea-floor in flat places is often covered with\r\nsea-anemones, these pieces would often sink down upon one, which would\r\nwelcome it as a dainty, and set about swallowing it, slowly in its own\r\nfashion. The fish must then have found by experience that it could tear\r\noff little bits much more easily from a piece that was held firmly by\r\nthe anemone than from one that was lying loose upon the ground, and\r\nthis may have caused it to do intentionally what was at first done by\r\nchance. But the sea-anemone, suffering no harm from the fish--indeed,\r\nits association of ideas, if I may use the expression, must rather\r\nhave been little fishes and unexpected food--had no cause to shoot\r\nits microscopic arrows at it, and did not do so even when the fish\r\nconcealed itself among the tentacles. This latter habit on the part of\r\nthe fish would be developed into an instinct through natural selection,\r\nsince the individuals that most frequently exhibited it would be the\r\nbest protected, and therefore, on an average, the most likely to\r\nsurvive. Whether the benevolent attitude of the anemone towards the\r\nfish is to be regarded as the expression of an instinct is open to\r\ndispute, for it is quite conceivable that each individual sea-anemone\r\nis disposed to gentleness by the behaviour of the fish, and so the\r\ndevelopment of a special hereditary instinct was unnecessary, because\r\nwithout it each anemone reacted in the manner most likely to secure its\r\nown advantage[7].\r\n\r\n[7] Since the above was written Plate has observed several similar\r\ncases in the Red Sea. A little fish lives along with the anemone,\r\n_Crambactis aurantiaca_, a foot in size, and not only conceals itself\r\namong its tentacles, but remains among them when the anemone draws them\r\nin. These fishes, therefore, must be immune against the stinging-cells\r\nof the sea-anemone; and in the same way another species of fish\r\nappears to be immune from the strong poison secreted by sea-urchins\r\nof the genus _Diadema_ from the points of their spines, among which\r\nthe fishes live. This relation certainly seems more like a one-sided\r\nadaptation on the part of the fishes than a true symbiosis, but in the\r\ncases observed by Sluiter the return service of the fishes seems to\r\nbe regularly rendered. Here, as everywhere else in nature, there are\r\ntransition stages, and a one-sided protective relation may gradually,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, be transformed into a symbiosis.\r\n\r\nThe same may be true of the fish as far as laying its booty in the\r\nmouth of the anemone is concerned; there may be no inherited instinct\r\nin this; it may be an intelligent action, which is learnt anew in the\r\nlifetime of each individual.\r\n\r\nIt might of course be objected to this interpretation that the\r\nbeginning of the process, namely, the assumption that chance fragments\r\nfrom the food of the fish falling just on the anemone is very\r\nimprobable; but I once observed that flat rocks washed over by the\r\nsea on the Mediterranean coast (not far from Ajaccio) were so thickly\r\ncovered with green anemones that at first I took the green growth for\r\nsome strange sea-grass new to me until I had pulled up a little tuft\r\nof the supposed plants and identified them as the soft tentacles of\r\n_Anthea cereus_. Anemones must be equally abundant in the tropical seas\r\nof Java, and a sinking fragment must often alight on the mouth of one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nMuch attention and keen discussion have in the last few decades been\r\nfocussed on cases of symbiosis between unicellular Algæ and simple\r\nanimals. A good example is our green fresh-water polyp, _Hydra viridis_\r\n(Fig. 35, _A_). Its beautiful colour is due to chlorophyll, and it was\r\nlong a matter of surprise that animals should produce chlorophyll,\r\nwhich is a characteristic and fundamental important substance of\r\nassimilating plants, until Geza Entz and M. Braun demonstrated that the\r\ngreen did not belong to the animal at all, but to unicellular green\r\nAlgæ, so-called Zoochlorellæ, which are embedded in the endoderm cells\r\nof the polyps in great numbers (Fig. 35, _zchl_). As these algoid\r\ncells assimilate, and thus liberate oxygen, their presence is of\r\nadvantage to the polyp. That--as was at first believed--they also yield\r\nnourishment to the polyp I consider very probable, notwithstanding\r\nthe apparently opposed results of the experiments of so acute an\r\nobserver as von Graff, for I have seen a large number of these animals\r\nthrive for months, and multiply rapidly by budding in pure water which\r\ncontained no food of any kind. In favour of this view, too, are some\r\nobservations, to be cited presently, on unicellular animals, in regard\r\nto whose nourishment by the zoochlorellæ living within them there can\r\nbe no doubt at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. _Hydra viridis_, the Green Fresh-water Polyp.\r\n_A_, the entire animal, greatly enlarged. _M_, the mouth. _t_,\r\ntentacles. _sp_, testis. _ov_, ovary, both in the ectoderm. _Ei_, a\r\nripe ovum, already green, in process of being extruded.

As Hamann has shown, the\r\nzoochlorellæ migrate at the time when an egg is formed in the outer\r\nlayer of the body of the polyp (Fig. 35) from the inner layer outwards,\r\npiercing through the supporting layer between them (st) and penetrating\r\ninto the egg (_B_, _Eiz_). They make their way only into the egg, not\r\ninto the sperm-cells, which in any case are too small to include them.\r\nThus they are absent from no young polyp of this species, and it is\r\neasy to understand why earlier experimental attempts to rear colourless\r\npolyps from eggs could never succeed even in the purest water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. _A_, _Amœba viridis_. _k_, the nucleus.\r\n_cv_, contractile vacuole. _zchl_, the zoochlorellæ. _B_, a single\r\nzoochlorella under high power. After A. Gruber.]\r\n\r\nQuite similar green algæ live in symbiosis with unicellular animals,\r\nas, for instance, with an amœba (Fig. 36) and with an Infusorian of the\r\ngenus _Bursaria_. In the Zoological Institute in Freiburg there is a\r\nliving colony of a green amœba and a green _Bursaria_, both of which\r\ncame from America, sent to us some years ago by Professor Wilder, of\r\nChicago, inside a letter with dried _Sphagnum_, or bog-moss. The plants\r\ncame from stagnant water in the Connecticut valley in Massachusetts.\r\nThat in this case the zoochlorellæ are of use to the animals within\r\nwhich they live, not only by giving off oxygen, but also by yielding\r\nfood-stuff, has been proved by A. Gruber, who bred the two green\r\nspecies for seven years in pure water which contained no trace of any\r\nkind of organic food for them. Nevertheless, they multiplied rapidly,\r\nand still form a green scum on the walls of the glass in which they are\r\nkept. They only die away when they are kept in the dark, where the algæ\r\nare unable to assimilate; then one green cell after another wanes and\r\ndisappears, and, in consequence, their hosts also die from the double\r\ncause of lack of oxygen and lack of food.\r\n\r\nEven in this case the symbiotically united organisms have not remained\r\nunaltered. The algæ at least differ from others of their kind in their\r\npower of resistance to living animal protoplasm. They are not digested\r\nby it, and we may infer from this that they possess some sort of\r\nprotective adaptation against the dissolving power of animal digestive\r\njuices; they must, therefore, have undergone some variation, and\r\nadapted themselves to the new situation. Probably their cell-membrane\r\nhas become impenetrable to the stuffs which would naturally digest\r\nthem, an adaptation which could not be referred to direct effect or to\r\nuse, but only to the accumulation of useful variations which cropped\r\nup--in other words, to natural selection. That any adaptive variation\r\nhas taken place on the part of the host, whether polyp, amœba, or\r\nInfusorian, cannot be made out. None of these have altered their\r\noriginal mode of life; they do not depend on the nourishment afforded\r\nby the algæ, but feed on other animals, if these come in their way,\r\nand they live in water rich in oxygen like other species allied to\r\nthem, and therefore are not altogether dependent on the algæ in this\r\nconnexion; but they can no more help having their partners than the pig\r\ncan help having Trichinæ in its muscles.\r\n\r\nSimilar plant-cells, not green however, but yellow, called\r\nzooxanthellæ, live in great numbers in the endoderm of various\r\nsea-anemones and in the soft plasmic substance of many Radiolarians.\r\nIn both these cases we must look for the benefit they confer on their\r\nhost in the oxygen they give off, for, like the green zoochlorellæ,\r\nthey break up carbonic acid gas in the light, and give off oxygen;\r\nthey no longer occur, as far as is known, in a free state, but are\r\nalways associated with the host, and they must therefore have altered\r\nin constitution, and have adapted themselves to the conditions of the\r\nsymbiosis.\r\n\r\nHigher plants, too, sometimes have symbiotic relations with animals;\r\nthe most remarkable and best-known example is the relation between ants\r\nand certain trees, in which the ants protect trees which afford them in\r\nreturn both a dwelling-place and food. We owe our knowledge of these\r\ncases to Thomas Belt and Fritz Müller, and more recently it has been\r\nmaterially increased by Schimper's researches.\r\n\r\nIn the forests of South America there grow 'Imbauba,' or\r\ncandelabra-trees, species of the genus _Cecropia_, which well deserve\r\ntheir name, for their bare branches stretch out like candelabra,\r\nand bear little bunches of leaves only at their tips. These leaves\r\nare menaced by the leaf-cutting ants of the genus _Œcodoma_, which\r\nattack numerous species of plants in these regions, often in tens of\r\nthousands, biting off the leaves, cutting them in pieces on the ground,\r\nand carrying them on their backs piece by piece to their nests. There\r\nthey use them to make a kind of compost heap, on which fungi, to which\r\nthe ants are very partial, readily grow. The candelabra-tree protects\r\nitself from these dangerous robbers, inasmuch as it has established an\r\nassociation with another ant (_Azteca instabilis_), which finds a safe\r\ndwelling-place in its hollow, chambered stem (Fig. 37, _A_), and feeds\r\non a brown sap which oozes from the inside. On the stem there are even\r\nlittle pits regularly arranged in definite places (_E_), through which\r\nthe female of _Azteca_ can easily bore her way into the interior. There\r\nshe lays her eggs, and soon the whole interior of the trunk teems with\r\nants, which come trooping out whenever the tree is shaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. _A_, a piece of a twig of an Imbauba-tree\r\n(_Cecropia adenopus_), with the leaves cut off. At the leaf-bases\r\nare the hair-cushions (_P_). _E_, the opening for the associated ant\r\n(_Azteca instabilis_). _B_, a piece of the hair-cushion with the\r\negg-shaped nutritive corpuscles (_nk_). After Schimper.]\r\n\r\nThis alone would not suffice to protect the tree against the\r\nleaf-cutting ants, for how should the Aztec ants living inside notice\r\nthe presence of the lightly climbing leaf-cutters? But that is\r\nprovided for, for the Aztecs also frequent the outside of the trunk,\r\nand just where attack would be most disastrous, namely, at the stalks\r\nof the young leaves. At these places there is a peculiar velvet-like\r\ncushion of hair (_P_), from which grow little stalked white papillæ\r\n(Fig. 37, _B_), which are rich in nourishment, and are not only eaten\r\nby the ants, but are harvested by them, being carried off into the\r\nants' dwellings, presumably to feed their larvæ. In this case, then,\r\na particular organ, offering special attraction to ants, has been\r\ndeveloped by the plant at the places more especially threatened; while,\r\nas regards the ants, it is probable that only the instincts of feeding\r\nand habitat require to be modified, since courage and thirst for battle\r\nare present in all ants, almost any species being ready at any time to\r\nthrow itself on any other which intrudes into its domain.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that not all the candelabra-trees live in symbiosis\r\nwith ants, and so secure a means of defence against the leaf-cutters.\r\nSchimper found in the primitive forests of South America several\r\nspecies of _Cecropia_ which never had ants in the chambers of their\r\nhollow stem. But these species did not exhibit the nutritive cushions\r\nat the base of the leaf-stalk; these contrivances for attracting and\r\nretaining the presence of partner ants were altogether absent. Indeed,\r\nonly one species, _Cecropia peltata_, has produced these peculiar\r\nstructures, and, as they are of no _direct_ use to the tree, we must\r\nsay that it has produced them only for the ants. Here, again, natural\r\nselection must have gradually brought about the development of these\r\nnutritive cushions, though as yet we do not know what the beginnings of\r\nthe process may have been. In no case can the origin of these cushions\r\nbe referred to any direct influence of the environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass to the association of two species of plants, of\r\nwhich the lichens furnish the best-known and probably most complete\r\nillustration. Till about twenty years ago the lichens, which in so many\r\ndiverse forms clothe the bark of trees, the stones, and the rocks,\r\nwere regarded as simple plants like the flowering plants, the ferns,\r\nor the mosses; and many lichenologists occupied themselves with the\r\nexact systematic distinction of about a thousand species, each of which\r\ncould be as well and exactly classified, according to form, colour,\r\nhabitat, and minute structure, as any other kind of plant. Then De Bary\r\nand Schwendener discovered that the lichens were made up of two kinds\r\nof plants, fungi and algæ, so intimately associated with and adapted\r\nto one another, that on coming together they always assume the same\r\nspecific form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. A fragment of a Lichen (_Ephebe kerneri_),\r\nmagnified 450 times. _a_, the green alga-cells. _P_, the fungoid\r\nfilaments. After Kerner.]\r\n\r\nThe framework, and therefore the largest part, and the one which\r\ndetermines the form of a lichen, is due to the fungus (Fig. 38).\r\nColourless threads of fungus ramify in a definite manner according\r\nto the species of fungus, and in the network of spaces left by this\r\nramification green alga-cells (_a_) lie singly, or in rows, or groups.\r\nThe fungus is propagated by multitudes of minute spores, which it\r\nproduces periodically, and these are disseminated in the air by the\r\nbursting of the sporangia and are carried away by the wind in the form\r\nof fine dust; the alga multiplies simply by continual division into\r\ntwo, but it also, like the whole lichen, can survive desiccation,\r\nand, after falling to pieces, is likewise carried through the air as\r\nmicroscopic dust.\r\n\r\nThe partnership of the two plants rests on a basis of mutual benefit;\r\nthe fungus, like all fungi, is without chlorophyll, and cannot\r\ntherefore decompose carbonic acid gas or elaborate its own organic\r\nfood-stuffs; it receives these from the alga. The alga has in the\r\nnetwork of the fungus a safe shelter and basis of attachment, for the\r\nfungus is able to bore into the bark of trees and even into stones;\r\nbesides which it absorbs water and salts, and supplies these to the\r\npartner alga. We here see the mutual advantage derived from the\r\npartnership, which is really an extremely intimate one. Fungus spores,\r\nsown by themselves, spring up and develop some branchings of fungoid\r\nhyphæ, a so-called mycelium, but without the requisite partner alga\r\nthese remain weak and soon die away. The alga, on the other hand,\r\ncan, in some cases, though not in all, survive without the fungus if\r\nthe necessary conditions of its life be supplied to it, but it grows\r\ndifferently and more luxuriantly in association with the fungus.\r\n\r\nThe same species of alga may be found associated with different species\r\nof fungi, and then each partnership forms a distinct species of lichen\r\nof definite and characteristic appearance; Stahl even succeeded in\r\nmaking new species of lichen artificially by bringing the spores of a\r\nlichen-forming fungus into contact with alga-cells, with which they had\r\nnever been associated in free nature.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of this remarkable association seems to me\r\nto be the formation of common reproductive bodies--an adaptation in\r\nface of which all doubt as to the theory of selection must disappear.\r\nPeriodically there are developed in the substance of the lichen small\r\ncorpuscles, the so-called soredia, each of which consists of one or\r\nmore alga-cells surrounded and kept together by threads of the fungus.\r\nWhen they are developed in large numbers they form a floury dust over\r\nthe maternal lichen, which 'breaks up' and leaves them, like the spores\r\nof the fungus, to be carried away by the wind. If these alight on\r\nfavourable soil nothing more is needed than the external conditions\r\nof development, light, warmth, and water, to enable the lichen to\r\nspring up anew. The great advantage to the preservation of 'species' is\r\nobvious, for, when multiplication by the ordinary method occurs among\r\nlichens, the spores of the fungus, even if they have fallen on good\r\nground, can only develop into a new lichen if chance bring to them the\r\nproper partner alga.\r\n\r\nObviously there must be, in the formation of the soredia, great\r\nadvantage for the species, or rather 'for the two species,' for the\r\nfungi as well as the algæ benefit by the arrangement, which ensures the\r\ncontinuance of the partnership. It was not without reason, however,\r\nthat the dual organism was so long regarded as a simple species in the\r\nnatural history sense, _for that is what it really is_, although it has\r\narisen in a manner quite different from the usual origin of species. As\r\nwe know species which consist only of single cells, and others which\r\nconsist of many cells, differentiated in different ways, and forming\r\na cell-community or 'person,' and, finally, others which consist of a\r\ncommunity of diversely differentiated personæ, making up a 'stock'; so\r\nin the lichens we see that even different species may combine to form\r\na new physiological whole, a vital unit, an individual of the highest\r\norder. When, at the outset of these lectures, I said that the theory\r\nof evolution was now no longer a mere hypothesis, and that its general\r\ntruth could no longer be doubted by any one acquainted with the facts\r\navailable, I had in my mind, among other facts, especially that of\r\nsymbiosis, and above all the case of the lichens.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting cases of symbiosis between two\r\ndifferent kinds of plants, and one side of the partnership is\r\nrepresented by fungi in a relatively large number of instances. The\r\nreason is not far to seek: fungi must always be dependent on other\r\nplants for their food; they must be parasitic, because they cannot\r\nthemselves produce the organic substances they require. They must\r\ntherefore associate themselves in some way with other organisms, living\r\nor dead, and as a general rule they simply prey upon their associate,\r\nsucking up its juices and killing it. But in not a few cases they can\r\nrender services in return, and, as we have seen in the case of the\r\nlichens, symbiosis may then occur. Fungi in general have the power of\r\ndiscovering and absorbing the least trace of water in the soil, and\r\nwith it they absorb the salts necessary to the plant, and in this,\r\napparently, consists the service which they are able to render even to\r\nlarge plants fixed deep in the earth, such as shrubs and trees. The\r\nroots of many of our forest trees, e.g. beech, oak, fir, silver poplar,\r\nand bushes like broom, heaths, and rhododendrons, are thickly wrapped\r\nround with a network of fungoid threads, and the mutual relations just\r\nindicated exist between these and the plants in question (Fig. 39,\r\n_A_ and _B_). The plants give to the fungi some contribution from the\r\nsuperfluity of their food-stuffs, and receive in return water and\r\nsalts, which are of value especially in times of drought. Perhaps there\r\nis some connexion between this and the fact that limes wither and lose\r\ntheir leaves so quickly during great summer-heat; these and many other\r\nof our trees possess no root-fungi or mycorhizæ.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, therefore, that genuine 'symbiosis' may have\r\narisen from parasitism. But that this is not the only path that leads\r\nto symbiosis is shown by the cases of animal symbiosis we have already\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. _A_, fragment of a Silver Poplar root, with an\r\nenvelope of symbiotic fungoid filaments (mycelium); after Kerner. _B_,\r\napex of a Beech root, with the closely enveloping mantle of mycelium;\r\nenlarged 480 times.]\r\n\r\nThe partnership between polyps and hermit-crabs may have arisen from a\r\none-sided commensalism, since polyps establishing themselves on mollusc\r\nshells which were often made use of by hermit-crabs would be better fed\r\nthan those which settled down on stones. There are still species which\r\nmake use of both modes of settlement. Then followed the adaptation\r\nof the crustacean to the polyp, for, first, those hermit-crabs would\r\nthrive best which tolerated the presence of the polyp; then those which\r\nsought its presence, that is to say, which gave a preference to shells\r\ncovered with polyps; and, finally, those which would take no others,\r\nand even themselves fixed the sea-anemone upon it, if it chanced to be\r\nremoved. Intelligence need not be taken into account in the matter at\r\nall, not even in the hermit-crab's case. We have only to recall the\r\ncomplex instincts, exercised only once in a lifetime, which compel the\r\nsilkworm and the emperor moth to elaborate their effective cocoons.\r\nThe elaboration of the spinning-instinct can only be due to natural\r\nselection, for the insect can have had no idea of the utility of its\r\nperformance, and the same is true in the case of the sea-anemones\r\nor the hydroid polyps and the hermit-crab. The sea-anemone is quite\r\nunconscious that it is defending its partner, the hermit-crab, when it\r\nlashes out its stinging acontia on any disturbance, and the hermit-crab\r\nis equally unaware that the sea-anemone is contributing to its safety;\r\nboth animals act quite unconsciously, purely instinctively, and the\r\norigin of these instincts, on which the symbiosis is based, must be\r\ndue, not to intelligent activities which have become habitual, but only\r\nto the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nAccording to the principle of natural selection nothing can arise\r\nbut that which is of use directly or indirectly to its possessor.\r\nNevertheless, there are cases in which it appears as if something had\r\narisen, which was of no use to the species in which the variation\r\nappeared, but only to the species protected by it. This is the case\r\nin the remarkable symbiosis between algæ of the family Nostocaceæ and\r\nthe floating, moss-like water-fern _Azolla_. This plant, in external\r\nappearance almost like duckweed, has on the under surface of its leaves\r\na minute opening, leading into a relatively roomy hair-lined cavity,\r\nand in this cavity there is always, enclosed in jelly, a bluish green\r\nunicellular alga, _Anabæna_. The cavity is present in every leaf, and\r\nthe alga is present in every cavity, making its way in from a deposit\r\nof alga-cells which is found on the incurved tip of every young shoot.\r\nAs soon as a young leaf of _Azolla_ unfolds from the bud it receives\r\nits _Anabæna_ cells from this deposit, and no one has yet found\r\neither twigs or leaves which were free from the algæ. But no one has\r\nsucceeded in discovering any benefit derived by the _Azolla_ from this\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a contradiction of the theory of selection, but there\r\nremains the possibility that there is some benefit rendered to the\r\n_Azolla_ by the alga, though we cannot see it as yet. There is also\r\nthe possibility that the cavity is an organ which was of use to the\r\nplant at an earlier time, perhaps as an insect-trap, but has now lost\r\nits significance, and is utilized by the alga as a dwelling-place.\r\nThis, however, is contradicted by the remarkable distribution of the\r\nfour known species of _Azolla_. Two of these are widely distributed in\r\nAmerica; the third lives in Australia, Asia, and Africa; the fourth\r\nin the region of the Nile: all four have cavities in their leaves,\r\nand in all these forms the cavity is inhabited by the same species of\r\n_Anabæna_. This indicates that the leaf-cavity and the partnership\r\nwith the alga must have originated in remote antiquity; the symbiosis\r\nmust date from a time before the four modern species of _Azolla_ had\r\nsplit off from a single parent-species. But no rudimentary organ,\r\nthat is to say, no organ not of use to the plant itself, would have\r\nbeen preserved through such a vast period of time, as we shall see\r\nlater, for useless organs disappear in the course of ages. As the\r\ncavity has not yet disappeared, we may assume with some probability\r\nthat it is useful to the plant, whether by means of the _Anabæna_, or\r\nin some other unknown way. To draw an argument against the reality of\r\nthe processes of selection from our lack of knowledge of what this\r\nadvantage may be would be as unreasonable as if, notwithstanding our\r\nexperience that stones sink in the water, we were to assume of a\r\nparticular stone which we did not see sink, because it was hidden from\r\nour sight by bushes, that perhaps it had not sunk, but was capable of\r\nfloating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE X\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF FLOWERS\r\n\r\n Introduction--Precursors of Darwin--Pollination\r\n by wind--Arrangements in flowers for securing\r\n cross-fertilization--Salvia, Pedicularis--Flowers visited by\r\n flies--Aristolochia--Pinguicula--Daphne--Orchids--Flowers are\r\n built up of adaptations--Mouth-parts of insects--Proboscis of\r\n butterflies--Mouth-parts of the cockroach--Of the bee--Pollen\r\n baskets of bees--Origin of flowers--Attraction of insects by\r\n colour--Limitation of the area visited--Nägeli's objection to\r\n the theory of selection--Other interpretations excluded--_Viola\r\n calcarata_--Only those changes which are useful to their possessors\r\n have persisted--Deceptive flowers--Cypripedium--Pollinia of\r\n Orchis--The case of the Yucca-moth--The relative imperfection of\r\n the adaptations tells in favour of their origin through natural\r\n selection--Honey thieves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN one species is so intimately bound up with another that neither\r\ncan live for any length of time except in partnership, that is\r\ncertainly an example of far-reaching mutual adaptation, but there\r\nare innumerable cases of mutual adaptation, in which, although there\r\nis no common life in the same place, yet the first form of life is\r\nadjusted in relation to the peculiarities of the second, and the second\r\nto those of the first. One of the most beautiful, and, in regard to\r\nnatural selection, the most instructive of these cases is illustrated\r\nby the relations between insects and the higher plants, relations which\r\nhave grown out of the fact that many insects have formed the habit of\r\nvisiting the flowers of the plants for the sake of the pollen. In this\r\nconnexion the theory of selection has made the most unexpected and\r\nhighly interesting disclosures, for it has informed us how the flowers\r\nhave arisen.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times the beauty, the splendour of colour, and the fragrance\r\nof flowers were regarded as phenomena created for the delight of\r\nmankind, or as an outcome of the infinite creative power of Mother\r\nNature, who loves to run riot in form and colour. Without allowing our\r\npleasure in all this manifold beauty to be spoilt, we must nowadays\r\nform quite a different conception of the way in which the flowers\r\nhave been called into being. Although here, as everywhere else in\r\nNature, we cannot go back to ultimate causes, yet we can show, on\r\nvery satisfactory evidence, that the flowers illustrate the reaction\r\nof the plants to the visits of insects, and that they have been in\r\nlarge measure evoked by these visits. There might, indeed, have\r\nbeen blossoms, but there would have been no flowers--that is to say,\r\nblossoms with large, coloured, outer parts, with fragrance, and with\r\nnectar inside, unless the blossoms had been sought out by insects\r\nduring the long ages. Flowers are adaptations of the higher flowering\r\nplants to the visits of insects. There can be no doubt about that now,\r\nfor--thanks to the numerous and very detailed studies of a small number\r\nof prominent workers--we need not only suppose it, we can prove it\r\nwith all the certainty that can be desired. The mutual adaptations of\r\ninsects and flowers afford one of the clearest examples of the mode\r\nof operation and the power of natural selection, and the case cannot\r\ntherefore be omitted from lectures on the theory of descent.\r\n\r\nThat bees and many other insects visit flowers for the sake of the\r\nnectar and pollen has been known to men from very early times. But this\r\nfact by itself would only explain why adaptations to flower-visiting\r\nhave taken place in these insects to enable them, for instance, to\r\nreach the nectar out of deep corolla-tubes, or to load themselves with\r\na great quantity of pollen, and to carry it to their hives, as happens\r\nin the case of the bees. But what causes the plants to produce nectar,\r\nand offer it to the insects, since it is of no use to themselves? And\r\nfurther, what induces them to make the pillage easier to the insects,\r\nby making their blossoms visible from afar through their brilliant\r\ncolours, or by sending forth a stream of fragrance that, even during\r\nthe night, guides their visitors towards them?\r\n\r\nAs far back as the end of the eighteenth century a thoughtful and\r\nclear-sighted Berlin naturalist, Christian Konrad Sprengel, took\r\na great step towards answering this question. In the year 1793 he\r\npublished a paper entitled 'The Newly Discovered Secret of Nature in\r\nthe Structure and Fertilization of Flowers[8],' in which he quite\r\ncorrectly recognized and interpreted a great many of the remarkable\r\nadaptations of flowers to the visits of insects. Unfortunately, the\r\nvalue of these discoveries was not appreciated in Sprengel's own time,\r\nand his work had to wait more than half a century for recognition.\r\n\r\n[8] _Das neu-entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur im Bau u. der Befruchtung\r\nder Blumen_, Berlin, 1793.\r\n\r\nSprengel was completely dominated by the idea of an all-wise Creator,\r\nwho 'has not created even a single hair without intention,' and, guided\r\nby this idea, he endeavoured to penetrate into the significance of\r\nmany little details in the structure of flowers. Thus he recognized\r\nthat the hairs which cover the lower surface of the petals of the\r\nwood-cranesbill (_Geranium sylvaticum_) protect the nectar of the\r\nflower from being diluted with rain, and he drew the conclusion,\r\ncorrect enough, though far removed from our modern ideas as regards the\r\ndirectly efficient cause, that the nectar was there for the insects.\r\n\r\nHe was also impressed by the fact that the sky-blue corolla of the\r\nforget-me-not (_Myosotis palustris_) has a beautiful yellow ring round\r\nthe entrance to the corolla-tube, and he interpreted this as a means by\r\nwhich insects were shown the way to the nectar which is concealed in\r\nthe depths of the tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. _Potentilla verna_, after Hermann Müller. _A_,\r\nseen from above. _Kbl_, sepals. _Bl_, petals. _Nt_, nectaries near the\r\nbase of the stamens. _B_, section through the flower. _Gr_, stigma.\r\n_St_, stamen. _Nt_, nectary.]\r\n\r\nWe now know that such 'honey-guides' are present in most of the flowers\r\nvisited by insects, in the form of spots, lines, or other marking,\r\nusually of conspicuous colour, that is, of a colour contrasting with\r\nthe ground colour of the flower. Thus, in species of Iris, regular\r\npaths of short hairs lead the way to the place where the nectar lies.\r\nIn the spring potentilla (_Potentilla verna_) (Fig. 40) the yellow\r\npetals (_A_, _Bl_) become bright orange-red towards their bases,\r\nand this shows the way to the nectaries, which lie at the bases\r\nof the stamens (_st_), and are protected by hairs, the so-called\r\n'nectar-covers' (_Saftdecke_) of Sprengel, from being washed by rain.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the honey-guides led Sprengel on to the idea that\r\nthe general colouring of the flower effects on a large scale what the\r\nhoney-guides do in a more detailed way--it attracts the attention of\r\npassing insects to where nectar is to be found; indeed, he went an\r\nimportant step further by recognizing that there are flowers which\r\ncannot fertilize themselves, in which the insect, in its search for\r\nhoney, covers itself with pollen, which is then rubbed off on the\r\nstigma of the next flower visited, fertilization being thus effected.\r\nHe demonstrated this not only for the Iris, but for many other\r\nflowers, and he drew the conclusion that 'Nature does not seem to have\r\nwished that any flower should be fertilized by its own pollen.' How\r\nnear Sprengel was to reaching a complete solution of the problem is\r\nnow plain to us, for he even discovered that many flowers, such as\r\n_Hemerocallis fulva_, remained infertile if they were dusted with their\r\nown pollen.\r\n\r\nEven the numerous experiments of that admirable German botanist, C. F.\r\nGärtner, although they advanced matters further, did not suffice to\r\nmake the relations between insects and flowers thoroughly clear; for\r\nthis the basis of the theory of Descent and Selection was necessary.\r\nHere, again, it was reserved for Charles Darwin to lead the way where\r\nboth contemporaries and predecessors had been blindly groping. He\r\nrecognized that, _in general_, self-fertilization is disadvantageous\r\nto plants; that they produce fewer seeds, and that these produce\r\nfeebler plants, than when they are cross-fertilized; that, therefore,\r\nthose flowers which are arranged to secure cross-fertilization have an\r\nadvantage over those which are self-fertilized. In many species, as\r\nSprengel had already pointed out, self-fertilization leads to actual\r\ninfertility; only a few plants are as fertile with their own pollen as\r\nwith that of another plant; and Darwin believed that, in all flowering\r\nplants, crossing with others of the same kind, at least from time to\r\ntime, is necessary if they are not to degenerate.\r\n\r\nThus the advantage which the flowers derive from the visits of\r\ninsects lies in the fact that insects are instrumental in the\r\ncross-fertilization of the flowers, and we can now understand how the\r\nplant was able to vary in a manner favourable to the insect-visits, and\r\nto exhibit adaptations which serve exclusively to make these visits\r\neasier; we understand how it was possible that there should develop\r\namong flowers an endless number of contrivances which served solely\r\nto attract insects, and even how, for the same end, the insignificant\r\nblossoms of the oldest Phanerogams must have been transformed into real\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nWe must not imagine, however, that the obviously important crossing of\r\nplant-individuals, usually called 'cross-pollination,' can be effected\r\nonly by means of insects. There were numerous plants in earlier times,\r\nand there is still a whole series in which cross-fertilization is\r\neffected through the air by the wind; these are the anemophilous or\r\nwind-pollinated Angiosperms.\r\n\r\nTo these belong most of the catkin-bearers, such as hazel and birch,\r\nand also the grasses and sedges, the hemp and the hop, and so forth.\r\nIn these plants there is no real flower, but only an inconspicuous\r\nblossom, without brightly-coloured outer envelopes, without fragrance\r\nor nectar; all of them have smooth pollen grains, which easily\r\nseparate into fine dust and are carried away by the wind until they\r\nfall, by chance, far from their place of origin, on the stigma of a\r\nfemale blossom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. Flower of Meadow Sage (_Salvia pratensis_),\r\nafter H. Müller. _st´_, immature anthers concealed in the 'helmet' of\r\nthe flower. _st´´_, mature anther lowered. _gr´_, immature stigma.\r\n_gr´´_, mature stigma. _U_, the lower lip of the corolla, the\r\nlanding-stage for the bee.]\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the phanerogams, however, especially\r\nall our indigenous 'flowers,' are, as a rule, fertilized by means of\r\ninsects, and it is amazing to see in what diverse ways, often highly\r\nspecialized, they have adapted themselves to the visits of insects.\r\nThus there are flowers in which the nectar lies open to view, and\r\nthese can be feasted on by all manner of insects; there are others in\r\nwhich the nectar is rather more concealed, but still easily found, and\r\nreached by insects with short mouth-parts, e.g. large flowers blooming\r\nby day and bearing much pollen, like the Magnolias. These have been\r\ncalled beetle-flowers, because they are visited especially by the\r\nhoney-loving Longicorns.\r\n\r\nOther flowers blooming by day are especially adapted to fertilization\r\nby means of bees; they are always beautifully coloured, often blue;\r\nthey are fragrant, and contain nectar deep down in the flower, where\r\nit can only be reached by the comparatively long proboscis of the\r\nbee. Different arrangements in the different flowers secure that\r\nthe bee cannot enjoy the nectar without at the same time effecting\r\nthe cross-pollination. Thus the stamens of the meadow sage (_Salvia\r\npratensis_) are at first hidden within the helmet-shaped upper lip of\r\nthe flower (Fig. 41, _st´_), but bear lower down on their stalk a short\r\nhandle-like process, which turns the pollen-bearing anther downwards\r\n(_st´´_) as soon as it is pressed back by an intruding insect. The\r\npollen-sacs then strike downwards on the back of the bee, and cover it\r\nwith pollen. When the bee visits another more mature flower, the long\r\nstyle, which was at first hidden within the helmet, has bent downwards\r\n(_gr´´_), and now stands just in front of the entrance to the flower,\r\nso that the bee must rub off a part of the pollen covering its back on\r\nto the stigma, and fertilization is thus effected.\r\n\r\nThere are other flowers which are specially disposed to suit\r\nthe visits of the humble-bees, as, for instance, _Pedicularis\r\nasplenifolia_, the fern-leaved louse-wort, a plant of the high Alps\r\n(Fig. 42). The first thing that strikes us about this plant is the\r\nthickly tufted hair covering on the calyx (_k_), which serves to keep\r\noff little wingless insects from the flower; then there is the strange\r\nleft-sided twisting of the individual flowers, whose under lip allows\r\nonly a strong insect like the humble-bee to gain access, towards the\r\nleft, to the corolla-tube (_kr_), in the depths of which the nectar is\r\nconcealed. While the humble-bee is sucking up the nectar it becomes\r\ndusted over with pollen from the anthers, which falls to dust at a\r\ntouch, and when it insinuates itself into a second flower its powdered\r\nback comes first into contact with the stigma of the pistil (_gr_)\r\nwhich projects from the elongated bill-shaped under lip, dusting it\r\nover with the pollen of the first visited flower. Butterflies and\r\nsmaller bees cannot rob this flower; it is strictly a humble-bee's\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. Alpine Lousewort (_Pedicularis asplenifolia_).\r\n_A_, flower seen from the left side, enlarged three times; the arrows\r\nshow the path by which the humble-bee enters. _B_, the same flower,\r\nseen from the left, after removal of the calyx, the lower lip and the\r\nleft half of the upper lip. _C_, ovary (_ov_), nectary (_n_), and base\r\nof style. _D_, tip of style, bearing the stigma. _E_, two anthers\r\nturned towards one another. _o_, upper lip. _u_, lower lip. _gr_,\r\nstyle. _st_, anthers. _kr_, corolla-tube. _k_, calyx.]\r\n\r\nThere are not a few of such flowers adapted to a very restricted\r\ncircle of visitors, and in all of them we find contrivances which\r\nclose the entrance to all except what we may call the welcome insects;\r\nsometimes there are cushions of bristles which prevent little insects\r\nfrom creeping up from below, or it is the oblique position of the\r\nflower which prevents their getting in from the stem; sometimes it is\r\nthe length and narrowness of the corolla-tube, or the deep and hidden\r\nsituation of the nectar, which only allows intelligent insects to find\r\nthe treasure.\r\n\r\nVery remarkable are those flowers which are adapted to the visits of\r\nflies, for they correspond in several respects to the peculiarities\r\nof these insects. In the first place, flies are fond of decaying\r\nsubstances and the odours given off by these, and so the flowers which\r\ndepend for their cross-fertilization on flies have taken on the dull\r\nand ugly colours of decay, and give out a disagreeable smell. But flies\r\nare also shy and restless, turning now hither, now thither, and cannot\r\nbe reckoned among the 'constant' insect visitors, that is to say, they\r\ndo not persistently visit the same species; it is, therefore, evident\r\nthat they might easily carry away the pollen without any useful result\r\nensuing. Moreover, their intelligence is of a low order, and they do\r\nnot seek nectar with the perseverance shown by bees and humble-bees. It\r\nis not surprising, therefore, to find that many of the flowers adapted\r\nfor the visits of flies are so constructed that they detain their\r\nvisitors until they have done their duty, that is to say, until they\r\nhave effected, or at least begun, the process of cross-pollination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.

After H. Müller.]\r\n\r\nOur birthwort (_Aristolochia clematitis_) and the Cuckoo-pint\r\n(_Arum maculatum_) are pit-fall flowers, whose long corolla-tubes\r\nhave an enlargement at the base, in which both pistil and stamens\r\nare contained. In the birthwort (Fig. 43) the narrow entrance-tube\r\nis thickly beset with stiff hairs (_A_, _b_), whose points are\r\nall directed towards the base. Little flies can creep down quite\r\ncomfortably into the basal expansion, but once there they are kept\r\nimprisoned until the flower, in consequence of the pollination of\r\nthe stigma, begins to wither, the first parts to go being these very\r\nbristles (_B_, _b´_), whose points, like a fish-weir, prevented the\r\nflies from creeping out. Other 'fly-flowers,' as for instance the\r\nAlpine butterwort (_Pinguicula alpina_) (Fig. 44), securely imprison\r\nthe plump fly as soon as it has succeeded in forcing itself in far\r\nenough to reach, with its short proboscis, the nectar contained in the\r\nspur (_sp_) of the corolla. The backward-directed bristles hold it fast\r\nfor some time, and it is only by hard pressing with the back against\r\nthe anthers (_st_) lying above it, and against the stigma (_n_), that\r\nit ultimately succeeds in getting free, but it never does so without\r\nhaving either loaded itself with pollen, or rubbed off on the stigma\r\nthe pollen it brought with it from another similar flower. The Alpine\r\nbutterwort is protogynous, that is to say, the pistil ripens first,\r\nthe pollen later, so that the possibility of self-fertilization is\r\naltogether excluded.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give even an approximate idea of the\r\ndiversity of the contrivances for securing fertilization in flowers\r\nwithout spending many hours over them, for they are different in\r\nalmost every flower, often widely so, and even in species of the same\r\ngenus they are by no means always alike; for not infrequently one\r\nspecies is adapted to one circle of visitors, and its near relative\r\nto another. Thus the flower of the common Daphne (_Daphne mezereum_)\r\n(Fig. 45, _A_ and _C_) is adapted to the visits of butterflies, bees,\r\nand hover-flies, while its nearest relative (_Daphne striata_) (Fig.\r\n45, _B_ and _D_) has a somewhat narrower and longer corolla-tube, so\r\nthat only butterflies can feast upon it. This example shows that there\r\nare exclusively 'butterfly flowers,' but specialization goes further,\r\nfor there are flowers adapted to diurnal and others to nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera. The former have usually bright, often red colours, and\r\na pleasant aromatic fragrance, and in all of them the nectar lies at\r\nthe bottom of a very narrow corolla-tube. To this class belong, for\r\ninstance, the species of pink, many orchids, such as _Orchis ustulata_,\r\nand _Nigritella angustifolia_ of the Alps, which smells strongly of\r\nvanilla; also the beautiful campion (_Lychnis diurna_) and the Alpine\r\nprimrose (_Primula farinosa_). The flowers adapted to nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera are characterized by pale, often white colour, and a strong\r\nand pleasant smell, which only begins to stream out after sunset, and\r\nindeed many of these flowers are quite closed by day. This is the case\r\nwith the large, white, scentless bindweed (_Convolvulus sepium_), which\r\nis chiefly visited and fertilized by the largest of our hawk-moths\r\n(_Sphinx convolvuli_). The pale soapwort (_Saponaria officinalis_)\r\nexhales a delicate fragrance which attracts the Sphingidæ from afar,\r\nand the sweet smell of the honeysuckle (_Lonicera periclymenum_) is\r\nwell known, and has the same effect; an arbour of honeysuckle often\r\nattracts whole companies of our most beautiful Sphingidæ and Noctuidæ\r\non warm June nights, to the great delight of the moth-collecting youth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. _Daphne mezereum_ (_A_ and _C_) and Daphne\r\nstriata (_B_ and _D_).

After H. Müller.]\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this account of flower-adaptations without\r\nconsidering the orchids somewhat more in detail, for it is among\r\nthem that we find the most far-reaching adaptations to the visits of\r\ninsects. Among them, too, great diversity prevails, as is evident\r\nfrom the fact that Darwin devoted a whole book to the arrangements\r\nfor fertilization in orchids, but the main features are very much the\r\nsame in the majority. Figure 46 gives a representation of one of our\r\ncommonest species (_Orchis mascula_), A shows the flower in side view,\r\n_B_ as it appears from in front. The flower seems as it were to float\r\non the end of the stalk (_st_), stretching out horizontally the spur\r\n(_sp_) which contains the nectar. Between the large, broad under lip\r\n(_U_), marked with a honey-guide (_sm_), and offering a convenient\r\nalighting surface, and the broad, cushion-like stigma (_n_) lies the\r\nentrance to the spur. Fertilization occurs in the following way:--The\r\nfly or bee, when it is in the act of pushing its proboscis into the\r\nnectar-containing spur, knocks with its head against the so-called\r\nrostellum (_r_), a little beak-like process at the base of the stamens\r\n(_p_). The pollen masses are of very peculiar construction, not falling\r\nto dust, but forming little stalked clubs, with the pollen grains glued\r\ntogether, and so arranged that they spring off when the rostellum is\r\ntouched and attach themselves to the head of the insect, as at _D_ on\r\nthe pencil (Fig. 46). When the bee has sucked up the nectar out of the\r\nspur, and then proceeds to penetrate into another flower of the same\r\nspecies, the pollinia have bent downwards on its forehead (_E_), and\r\nmust unfailingly come in contact with the stigma of the second flower,\r\nto which they now remain attached, and effect its fertilization. What\r\na long chain of purposeful arrangements in a single flower, and no\r\ninterpretation of them is available except through natural selection!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. Common Orchis (_Orchis mascula_). _A_, flower\r\nin side view. _st_, stalk. _sp_, spur with the nectary (_n_). _ei_,\r\nentrance to the spur. _U_, lower lip. _B_, flower from in front. _p_,\r\npollinia. _Sm_, honey-guide. _ei_, entrance to the nectar. _na_,\r\nstigma. _r_, rostellum. _U_, lower lip. _C_, vertical section through\r\nthe rostellum (_r_), pollinium (_p_). _ei_, entrance. _D_, the pollinia\r\nremoved and standing erect on the tip of a lead-pencil. _E_, the same,\r\nsomewhat later, curved downwards.]\r\n\r\nAnd how diversely are these again modified in the different genera\r\nand species of orchids, of which one is adapted to the visits of\r\nbutterflies exclusively, as _Orchis ustulata_, another to those of\r\nbees, as _Orchis morio_, and a third to those of flies, as _Ophrys\r\nmuscifera_. These flowers are adapted to insect visits in the minutest\r\ndetails of the form of the petals, which are smooth, as if polished\r\nwith wax, where insects are not intended to creep, but velvety or hairy\r\nwhere the path leads to the nectar, and at the same time to the pollen\r\nand the stigma. And then there is the diversity in the form and colour\r\nof the 'honey-guides' on the 'alighting surface,' that is, the under\r\nlip of the flower, upon which the insect sits and holds fast, while it\r\npushes its head as far as possible into the spur, so that its proboscis\r\nmay reach the nectar lying deep within it! Even though we cannot\r\npretend to guess at the significance of every curve and colour-spot in\r\none of the great tropical orchids, such as _Stanhopea tigrina_, yet we\r\nmay believe, with Sprengel, that all this has its significance, or has\r\nhad it for the ancestors of the plant in question, and in fact that\r\nthe flower is made up of nothing but adaptations, either actual or\r\ninherited from its ancestors, although sometimes perhaps no longer of\r\nfunctional importance.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, we have illustrated the fact that there are hundreds and\r\nthousands of contrivances in flowers adapted solely to the visits of\r\ninsects and to securing cross-fertilization, and these adaptations go\r\nso far that we might almost believe them to be the outcome of the most\r\nexact calculation and the most ingenious reflection. But they all admit\r\nof interpretation through natural selection, for all these details,\r\nwhich used to be looked upon as merely ornamental, are directly or\r\nindirectly of use to the species; directly, when, for instance, they\r\nconcern the dusting of the insect with the pollen; indirectly, when\r\nthey are a means of attracting visits.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the evidence of the operation of the processes of selection\r\nbecomes absolutely convincing when we consider that, as in symbiosis,\r\nthere are always two sets of adaptations taking place independently\r\nof one another--those of the flowers to the visits of the insects,\r\nand those of the insects to the habit of visiting the flowers. To\r\nunderstand this clearly we must turn our attention to the insects, and\r\ntry to see in what way they have been changed by adapting themselves to\r\nthe diet which the flowers afford.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, several orders of insects possess mouth-parts which\r\nare suited for sucking up fluids, and these have evolved, through\r\nadaptation to a fluid diet, from the biting mouth-parts of the\r\nprimitive insects which we see still surviving in several orders.\r\nThus the Diptera may have gradually acquired the sucking proboscis\r\nwhich occurs in many of them by licking up decaying vegetable and\r\nanimal matter, and by piercing into and sucking living animals. But\r\neven among the Diptera several families have more recently adapted\r\nthemselves quite specially to a flower diet, to honey-sucking, like the\r\nhover-flies, the Syrphidæ, and the Bombyliidæ, whose long thin proboscis\r\npenetrates deep into narrow corolla-tubes, and is able to suck up the\r\nnectar from the very bottom. The transformation was not so important\r\nin this case, since the already existing sucking apparatus only\r\nrequired to be a little altered.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the order Hemiptera (Bugs) the suctorial proboscis does not\r\nowe its origin to a diet of flowers, for no member of the group is now\r\nadapted to that mode of obtaining food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. Head of a Butterfly. _A_, seen from in front.\r\n_au_, eyes. _la_, upper lip. _md_, rudiments of the mandibles. _pm_,\r\nrudimentary maxillary palps. _mx´_, the first maxillæ modified into the\r\nsuctorial proboscis. _pl_, palps of labium or second maxillæ, cut off\r\nat the root, remaining in _B_--which is a side view. _at_, antennæ.\r\nAdapted from Savigny.]\r\n\r\nThe proboscis of the Lepidoptera, on the other hand, depends entirely\r\non adaptation to honey-sucking, and we may go the length of saying that\r\nthe order of Lepidoptera would not exist if there were no flowers.\r\nThis large and diverse insect-group is probably descended from the\r\nancestors of the modern caddis-flies or Phryganidæ, whose weakly\r\ndeveloped jaws were chiefly used for licking up the sugary juices of\r\nplants. But as flowering plants evolved the licking apparatus of the\r\nprimitive butterflies developed more and more into a sucking organ, and\r\nwas ultimately transformed into the long, spirally coiled suctorial\r\nproboscis as we see it in the modern butterflies (Fig. 47). It has\r\ntaken some pains to trace this organ back to the biting mouth-parts of\r\nthe primitive insects, for nearly everything about it has degenerated\r\nand become stunted except the maxillæ (_mx´_). Even the palps (_pm_)\r\nof these have become so small and inconspicuous in most of the\r\nLepidoptera that it is only quite recently that remains of them have\r\nbeen recognized in a minute protuberance among the hairs. The mandibles\r\n(_md_) have quite degenerated, and even the under lip has disappeared,\r\nand only its palps are well developed (_B_, _pl_). But the first\r\nmaxillæ (_mx´_), although very strong and long, are so extraordinarily\r\naltered in shape and structure that they diverge from the maxillæ of\r\nall other insects. They have become hollow, probe-like half-tubes,\r\nwhich fit together exactly, and thus form a closed sucking-tube of most\r\ncomplex construction, composed of many very small joints, after the\r\nfashion of a chain-saw, which are all moved by little muscles, and are\r\nsubject to the will through nerves, and are also furnished with tactile\r\nand taste papillæ. Except this remarkable sucking proboscis there are\r\nno peculiarities in the body of the butterfly which might be regarded\r\nas adaptations to flower-visiting, with a few isolated exceptions, of\r\nwhich one will be mentioned later. This is intelligible enough, for\r\nthe butterfly has nothing more to seek from the flower beyond food for\r\nitself; it does not carry stores for offspring.\r\n\r\nThe bees, however, do this, and accordingly we find that in them the\r\nadaptations to flower-visiting are not confined to the mouth-parts.\r\n\r\nAs far as we can judge now, the flower-visiting bees are descended\r\nfrom insects which resembled the modern burrowing-wasps. Among these\r\nthe females themselves live on nectar and pollen, and build cells in\r\nholes in the ground, and feed their brood. They do not feed them on\r\nhoney, however, but on animals--on caterpillars, grasshoppers, and\r\nother insects, which they kill by a sting in the abdomen, or often only\r\nparalyse, so that the victim is brought into the cells of the nest\r\nalive but defenceless, and remains alive until the young larva of the\r\nwasp, which emerges from the egg, sets to work to devour it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. Mouth-parts of the Cockroach (_Periplaneta\r\norientalis_), after R. Hertwig. _la_, upper lip or labrum. _md_,\r\nmandibles. _mx_^1, first maxillæ, with _c_, cardo, _st_, stipes, _li_,\r\ninternal lobe or lacinia, _le_, external lobe or galea, and _pm_, the\r\nmaxillary palp. _mx_^2, the labium or second maxillæ, with similar\r\ndetailed parts.]\r\n\r\nBefore I go on to explain the origin of the sucking proboscis of the\r\nbee from the biting mouth-parts of the primitive insects I must first\r\nbriefly consider the latter.\r\n\r\nThe biting mouth-parts of beetles, Neuroptera, and Orthoptera (Fig.\r\n48), consist of three pairs of jaws, of which the first, the mandibles\r\n(_md_), are simply powerful pincers for seizing and tearing or chewing\r\nthe food. They have no part in the development of the suctorial\r\napparatus either in bees or in butterflies, so they may be left out\r\nof account. The two other pairs of jaws, the first and second maxillæ\r\n(_mx_^1 and _mx_^2), are constructed exactly on the same type, having\r\na jointed basal portion (_st_) bearing two lobes, an external (_le_)\r\nand an internal (_li_), and a feeler or palp, usually with several\r\njoints, directed outwards from the lobes (_pm_ and _pl_). The second\r\npair of maxillæ (_mx_^2) differs from the first chiefly in this, that\r\nthe components of the pair meet in the median line of the body, and\r\nfuse more or less to form the so-called 'under lip' or labium. In the\r\nexample given, the cockroach (_Periplaneta orientalis_), this fusion\r\nis only partial, the lobes having remained separate (_le_ and _li_);\r\nand the same is true of the bee, but in this case the inner lobes have\r\ngrown into a long worm-like process which is thrust into the nectar in\r\nthe act of sucking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. Head of the Bee. _Au_, compound eyes. _au_,\r\nocelli. _at_, antennæ. _la_, upper lip. _md_, mandibles. _mx_^1, first\r\nmaxillæ, with _pm_, the rudimentary maxillary palp. _mx_^2, second\r\nmaxillæ with the internal lobes (_li_) fused to form the 'tongue.'\r\n_le_, the external lobes of the second maxillæ, known as 'paraglossæ.'\r\n_pl_, labial palp.]\r\n\r\nEven the burrowing-wasps exhibit the beginnings of variation in this\r\ndirection, for the under lip is somewhat lengthened and modified into\r\na licking organ. The adaptation has not gone much further than this,\r\neven in one of the true flower-bees, _Prosopis_, which feeds its larvæ\r\nwith pollen and honey, and it is only in the true honey-bee that the\r\nadaptation is complete (Fig. 49). Here the so-called 'inner lobe' of\r\nthe under lip (_li_) has elongated into the worm-shaped process already\r\nmentioned; it is thickly covered with short bristles, and is called\r\nthe 'tongue' of the bee (_li_). The outer lobes of the under lip have\r\ndegenerated into little leaf-like organs, the so-called accessory\r\ntongue or paraglossa (_le_), while the palps of the under lip (_pl_)\r\nhave elongated to correspond with the tongue, and serve as a sensitive\r\nand probably also as a smelling organ, in contrast to the palps of the\r\nfirst maxillæ, which have shrunk to minute stumps (_pm_). The whole\r\nof the under lip, which has elongated even in its basal portions,\r\nforms, with the equally long first maxillæ, the proboscis of the bee.\r\nThe first maxillæ are sheath-like half-tubes, closely apposed around\r\nthe tongue, and form along with it the suctorial tube, through which\r\nthe nectar is sucked up. Thus, of the three pairs of jaws in insects,\r\nonly the first pair, the mandibles, have remained unaltered, obviously\r\nbecause the bee requires a biting-organ for eating pollen, for kneading\r\nwax, and for building cells.\r\n\r\nBut bees do not only feast on nectar and pollen themselves, they carry\r\nthese home as food for their larvæ. The form already mentioned,\r\n_Prosopis_, takes up pollen and nectar in its mouth, and afterwards\r\ndisgorges the pulp as food for its larvæ, but the rest of the true\r\nbees have special and much more effective collecting-organs, either a\r\nthick covering of hair on the abdomen, or along the whole length of the\r\nposterior legs, or finally, a highly developed collecting apparatus,\r\nsuch as that possessed by the honey-bee--the basket and brush on the\r\nhind leg. The former is a hollow on the outer surface of the tibia, the\r\nlatter a considerable enlargement of the basal tarsal joint, which, at\r\nthe same time, is covered on the inner surface with short bristles,\r\narranged in transverse rows like a brush. The bee kneads the pollen\r\ninto the basket, and one can often see bees flying back to the hive\r\nwith a thick yellow ball of pollen on the hind leg. In those bees which\r\ncollect on the abdomen, like _Osmia_ and _Megachile_, the pollen mass\r\nforms a thick clump on the belly, and in the case of _Andrena_ Sprengel\r\nobserved long ago that it sometimes flew with a packet of pollen bigger\r\nthan its own body on the hind leg.\r\n\r\nAll these are contrivances which have gradually originated through the\r\nhabit of carrying home pollen for the helpless larvæ shut up in the\r\ncells. They have developed differently in the various groups of bees,\r\nprobably because the primary variations with which the process of\r\nselection began were different in the various ancestral forms.\r\n\r\nIn the ancestors of those which carry pollen on the abdomen there\r\nwas probably a thick covering of hair on the ventral surface of the\r\nbody, which served as a starting-point for the selection, and, in\r\nconsequence, the further course of the adaptation would be concerned\r\nsolely with this hair-covered surface, while variations in other less\r\nhairy spots would remain un-utilized.\r\n\r\nAfter all this it will no longer seem a paradoxical statement that the\r\nexistence of gaily coloured, diversely formed, and fragrant flowers is\r\ndue to the visits of insects, and that, on the other hand, many insects\r\nhave undergone essential transformations in their mouth-parts and\r\notherwise as an adaptation to a flower diet, and that an entire order\r\nof insects with thousands of species--the Lepidoptera--would not be\r\nin existence at all if there had been no flowers. We must now attempt\r\nto show, in a more detailed way, how, by what steps, and under what\r\nconditions, our modern flowers have arisen from the earlier flowering\r\nplants. In this I follow closely the classic exposition which we owe to\r\nHermann Müller.\r\n\r\nThe ancestral forms of the modern higher plants, the so-called\r\n'primitive seed plants' or 'Archisperms,' were all anemophilous, as the\r\nConifers and Cycads are still. Their smooth pollen-grains, produced\r\nin enormous quantities, fell like clouds of dust into the air, were\r\ncarried by the wind hither and thither, and some occasionally alighted\r\non the stigma of a female flower. In these plants the sexes often occur\r\nseparately on different trees or individuals, and there must be a\r\ncertain advantage in this when the pollination is effected by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe male flowers of the Archisperms would be visited by insects in\r\nremote ages, just as they are now; but the visitors came to feed upon\r\nthe pollen, and did not render any service to the plant in return;\r\nthey rather did it harm by reducing its store of pollen. If it was\r\npossible to cause the insect to benefit the plant at the same time\r\nas it was pillaging the pollen, by carrying some of it to female\r\nblossoms and thereby securing cross-fertilization, it would be of\r\ngreat advantage, for the plant would no longer require to produce such\r\nenormous quantities of pollen, and the fertilization would be much\r\nmore certain than when it depended on the wind. It is obvious that the\r\nsuccessful pollination of anemophilous plants implies good weather and\r\na favourable wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. Flowers of the Willow (_Salix cinerea_); after\r\nH. Müller. _A_, the male. _B_, the female catkin. _C_, individual male\r\nflower; _n_, nectary. _D_, individual female flower; _n_, nectary. _E_,\r\nPoplar, an exceptional hermaphrodite flower.]\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the utilization of the insect-visitors in\r\nfertilization might be secured in either of two ways; the female\r\nblossoms might also offer something attractive to the insects, or\r\nhermaphrodite flowers might be formed. As a matter of fact, both ways\r\nhave been followed by Nature. An example of the former is the willow,\r\nthe cross-fertilization of which was forced upon the insects by the\r\ndevelopment in both female and male blossoms of a nectary (Fig. 50,\r\n_C_ and _D_), a little pit or basin in which nectar was secreted. The\r\ninsects flew now to male and now to female willow-catkins, and in doing\r\nso they carried to the stigma of the female blossom the pollen, which\r\nin this case was not dusty but sticky, so that it readily adhered to\r\ntheir bodies.\r\n\r\nThe securing of cross-fertilization by the development of hermaphrodite\r\nflowers has, however, occurred much more frequently, and we can\r\nunderstand that this method secured the advantageous crossing much more\r\nperfectly, for the pollen had necessarily to be carried from blossom\r\nto blossom, while, in cases like that of the willow, countless male\r\nblossoms might be visited for nectar one after the other before the\r\ninsect made up its mind to fly to a female blossom of the same species.\r\nThe beginnings of the modification of the unisexual flowers in this\r\ndirection may be seen in variations which occur even now, for we not\r\ninfrequently find, in a male catkin, individual blossoms, which, in\r\naddition to the stamens, possess also a pistil with a stigma. (Fig. 50\r\n_E_ shows such an abnormal hermaphrodite flower from a poplar.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as hermaphrodite flowers came into existence the struggle\r\nto attract insects began in a more intense degree. Every little\r\nimprovement in this direction would form the starting-point of a\r\nprocess of selection, and would be carried on and increased to the\r\nhighest possible pitch of perfection.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the outer envelopes of the blossoms which first changed\r\ntheir original green into other colours, usually those which contrasted\r\nstrongly with the green, and thus directed the attention of the insects\r\nto the flowers. Variations in the colour of ordinary leaves are\r\nalways cropping up from time to time, whether it be that the green is\r\ntransformed into yellow or that the chlorophyll disappears more or less\r\ncompletely and red or blue coloured juices take its place. Many insects\r\ncan undoubtedly see colour, and are attracted by the size of coloured\r\nflowers, as Hermann Müller found by counting the visits of insects to\r\ntwo nearly related species of mallow, one of which, _Malva silvestris_,\r\nhas very large bright rose-red flowers visible from afar, while the\r\nother, _Malva rotundifolia_, has very inconspicuous small pale-red\r\nflowers. To the former there were thirty-one different visitors, to the\r\nlatter he could only make sure of four. The second species, as is to be\r\nexpected, depends chiefly on self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been disputed from various quarters that insects are\r\nattracted by the colours of the flowers, and these objections are\r\nbased chiefly on experiments with artificial flowers. But when, for\r\ninstance, Plateau, in the course of such experiments saw bees and\r\nbutterflies first fly towards the artificial flowers, and then turn\r\naway and concern themselves no more about them, that only proves that\r\ntheir sight is sharper than we have given them credit for; for though\r\nthey may be deceived at a distance, they are not so when they are near;\r\nit is possible, too, that the sense of smell turns the scale[9]. I\r\nhave myself made similar experiments with diurnal butterflies, before\r\nwhich I placed a single artificial chrysanthemum midst a mass of\r\nnatural flowers. It rarely happened indeed that a butterfly settled on\r\nthe artificial flower; they usually flew first above it, but did not\r\nalight. Twice, however, I saw them alight on the artificial flower,\r\nand eagerly grope about with the proboscis for a few moments, then fly\r\nquickly away. They had visited the real chrysanthemums or horse-daisies\r\nwith evident delight, and eagerly sucked up the honey from the many\r\nindividual florets of every flower, and they now endeavoured to do\r\nthe same in the artificial flower, and only desisted when the attempt\r\nproved unsuccessful. In this experiment the colours were of course\r\nonly white and yellow; with red and blue it is probably more difficult\r\nto give the exact impression of the natural flower-colours; and in\r\naddition there is the absence of the delicate fragrance exhaled by the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n[9] The experiments of Plateau have since been criticized by\r\nKienitz-Gerloff, who altogether denies their value (1903).\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed that the colour is certainly not the sole attraction\r\nto the flower; the fragrance helps in most cases, and even this is\r\nnot the object of the insect's visits. The real object is the nectar,\r\nto which colour and fragrance only show the way. The development of\r\nfragrance and nectar must, like that of the colour, have been carried\r\non and increased by processes of selection, which had their basis in\r\nthe necessity for securing insect-visits, and as soon as these main\r\nqualities of the flower were established greater refinements would\r\nbegin, and flower-forms would be evolved, which would diverge farther\r\nand farther, especially in shape, from the originally simple and\r\nregular form of the blossom.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this must have lain chiefly in the fact that, after\r\ninsect-visits in general were secured by a flower, it would be\r\nadvantageous to exclude all insects which would pillage the nectar\r\nwithout rendering in return the service of cross-fertilization--all\r\nthose, therefore, which were unsuited either because of their minute\r\nsize or because of the inconstancy of their visits. Before the\r\nbutterflies and the bees existed, the regularly formed flat flower with\r\nunconcealed nectar would be visited by a mixed company of caddis-flies,\r\nsaw-flies, and ichneumon-flies. But as the nectar changed its place to\r\nthe deeper recesses of the flower it was withdrawn from all but the\r\nmore intelligent insects, and thus the circle of visitors was already\r\nnarrowed to some extent. But when in a particular species the petals\r\nfused into a short tube, all visitors were excluded whose mouth-parts\r\nwere too short to reach the nectar; while among those which could\r\nreach it the process of proboscis-formation began; the under lip, or\r\nthe first maxillæ, or both parts together, lengthened step for step\r\nwith the corolla-tube of the flower, and thus from the caddis-flies\r\ncame the butterflies, and from the ichneumon-flies the burrowing-wasps\r\n(_Sphegidæ_) and the bees.\r\n\r\nAt first sight one might perhaps imagine that it would have been more\r\nadvantageous to the flowers to attract a great many visitors, but\r\nthis is obviously not the case. On the contrary, specialized flowers,\r\naccessible only to a few visitors, have a much greater certainty of\r\nbeing pollinated by them, because insects which only fly to a few\r\nspecies are more certain to visit these, and above all to visit many\r\nflowers of the same species one after another. Hermann Müller observed\r\nthat, in four minutes, one of the humming-bird hawk-moths (_Macroglossa\r\nstellatarum_) visited 108 different flowers of the same species, the\r\nbeautiful Alpine violet (_Viola calcarata_), one after the other, and\r\nit may have effected an equal number of pollinations in that short time.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, a real advantage to the flowers to narrow their\r\ncircle of visitors more and more by varying so that only the useful\r\nvisitors could gain access to their nectar, and that the rest should\r\nbe excluded. Thus there arose 'bee-flowers,' 'butterfly-flowers,'\r\n'hawk-moth flowers,' and, indeed, in many cases, a species of flower\r\nhas become so highly specialized that its fertilization can only\r\nbe brought about by a single species of insect. This explains the\r\nremarkable adaptations of the orchids and the enormous length of the\r\nproboscis in certain butterflies. Even our own hawk-moths _Macroglossa\r\nstellatarum_ and _Sphinx convolvuli_ show an astonishing length of\r\nproboscis, which measures 8 cm. in the latter species. In _Macrosilia\r\ncluentius_, in Brazil, the proboscis is 20 cm. in length; and in\r\nMadagascar there grows an orchid with nectaries 30 cm. in length,\r\nfilled with nectar to a depth of 2 cm., but the fertilizing hawk-moth\r\nis not yet known.\r\n\r\nThus we may say that the flowers, by varying in one direction or\r\nanother, have selected a definite circle of visitors, and, conversely,\r\nthat particular insect-groups have selected particular flowers for\r\nthemselves, for those transformations of the flowers were always most\r\nadvantageous which secured to them the exclusive visits of their best\r\ncrossing agents, and these transformations were, on the one hand,\r\nsuch as kept off unwelcome visitors, and, on the other hand, such as\r\nattracted the most suitable ones.\r\n\r\nFrom the botanical point of view the assumption that flowers and\r\nflower-visiting insects have been adapted to each other by means\r\nof processes of selection has been regarded as untenable, because\r\nevery variation in the flower presupposes a corresponding one in the\r\ninsect. I should not have mentioned this objection had it not come\r\nfrom such a famous naturalist as Nägeli, and if it were not both\r\ninteresting and useful in our present discussion. Nägeli maintained\r\nthat selection could not, for instance, have effected a lengthening\r\nof the corolla-tube of a flower, because the proboscis of the insects\r\nmust have lengthened _simultaneously_ with it. If the corolla-tube\r\nhad lengthened alone, without the proboscis of the butterfly being\r\nat the same time elongated, the flower would no longer be fertilized\r\nat all, and if the lengthening of the proboscis preceded that of the\r\ncorolla-tube it would have no value for the butterfly, and could not\r\ntherefore have been the object of a process of selection.\r\n\r\nThis objection overlooks the facts that a species of plant and of\r\nbutterfly consists not of one individual but of thousands or millions,\r\nand that these are not absolutely uniform, but in fact heterogeneous.\r\nIt is precisely in this that the struggle for existence consists--that\r\nthe individuals of every species differ from one another, and that\r\nsome are better, others less well constituted. The elimination of the\r\nlatter and the preferring of the former constitutes the process of\r\nselection, which always secures the fitter by continually rejecting the\r\nless fit. In the case we are considering, then, there would be, among\r\nthe individuals of the plant-species concerned, flowers with a longer\r\nand flowers with a shorter corolla-tube, and among the butterflies\r\nsome with a longer and some with a shorter proboscis. If among the\r\nflowers the longer ones were more certain to be cross-fertilized than\r\nthe shorter ones, because hurtful visitors were better excluded, the\r\nlonger ones would produce more and better seeds, and would transmit\r\ntheir character to more descendants; and if, among the butterflies,\r\nthose with the longer proboscis had an advantage, because the nectar\r\nin the longer tubes would, so to speak, be reserved for them, and they\r\nwould thus be better nourished than those with the shorter proboscis,\r\nthe number of individuals with long proboscis must have increased from\r\ngeneration to generation. Thus the length of the corolla-tube and the\r\nlength of the proboscis would go on increasing as long as there was\r\nany advantage in it for the flower, and both parties must of necessity\r\nhave varied _pari passu_, since every lengthening of the corolla\r\nwas accompanied by a preferring of the longest proboscis variation.\r\nThe augmentation of the characters depended on, and could only have\r\ndepended on, a guiding of the variations in the direction of utility.\r\nBut this is exactly what we call, after Darwin and Wallace, Natural\r\nSelection.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, in the history of flowers, a means of demonstrating\r\nthe reality of the processes of selection in two other ways. In the\r\nfirst place, it is obvious that no other interpretation can be given\r\nof such simultaneous mutual adaptations of two different kinds of\r\norganisms. If we were to postulate, as Nägeli, for instance, did, an\r\nintrinsic Power of Development in organisms, which produces and guides\r\ntheir variations, we should, as I have already said, be compelled\r\nalso to take for granted a kind of pre-established harmony, such as\r\nLeibnitz assumed to account for the correlation of body and mind:\r\nplant and insect must always have been correspondingly altered so that\r\nthey bore the same relation to each other as two clocks which were\r\nso exactly fashioned that they always kept time, though they did not\r\ninfluence each other. But the case would be more complicated than that\r\nof the clocks, because the changes which must have taken place on both\r\nsides were quite different, and yet at the same time such that they\r\ncorresponded as exactly as Will and Action. The whole history of the\r\nearth and of the forms of life must, therefore, have been foreseen\r\ndown to the smallest details, and embodied in the postulated Power of\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\nBut such an assumption could hardly lay claim to the rank of a\r\nscientific hypothesis. Although every grain of sand blown about by\r\nthe wind on this earth could certainly only have fallen where it\r\nactually did fall, yet it is in the power of any of us to throw a\r\nhandful of sand wherever it pleases us, and although even this act of\r\nthrowing must have had its sufficient reason in us, yet no one could\r\nmaintain that its direction and the places where the grains fell were\r\npredestined in the history of the earth. In other words: That which we\r\ncall chance plays a part also in the evolution of organisms, and the\r\nassumption of a Power of Development, predestinating even in detail,\r\nis contradicted by the fact that species are transformed in accordance\r\nwith the chance conditions of their life.\r\n\r\nThis can be clearly demonstrated in the case of flowers. That the wild\r\npansy (_Viola tricolor_), which lives in the plains and on mountains of\r\nmoderate elevation, is fertilized by bees, and the nearly allied _Viola\r\ncalcarata_ of the High Alps by Lepidoptera, is readily intelligible,\r\nsince bees are very abundant in the lower region, and make the\r\nfertilization of the species a certainty, while this is not so in the\r\nHigh Alps. There the Lepidoptera are greatly in the majority, as every\r\none knows who has traversed the flower-decked meads of the High Alps in\r\nJuly, and has seen the hundreds and thousands of butterflies and moths\r\nwhich fly from flower to flower. Thus the viola of the High Alps has\r\nbecome a 'butterfly-flower' by the development of its nectaries into a\r\nlong spur, accessible only to the proboscis of a moth or butterfly. The\r\nchance which led certain individuals of the ancestral species to climb\r\nthe Alps must also have supplied the incentive to the production of the\r\nchanges adapted to the visits of the prevalent insect. The hypothesis\r\nof a predestinating Power of Development suffers utter shipwreck in\r\nface of facts like these.\r\n\r\nWe have, furthermore, an excellent touchstone for the reality of the\r\nprocesses of selection in the _quality_ of the variations in flowers\r\nand insects. Natural selection can only bring about those changes\r\nwhich are of use to the possessors themselves; we should therefore\r\nexpect to find among flowers only such arrangements as are, directly or\r\nindirectly, of use to them, and, conversely, among insects only such as\r\nare useful to the insect.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what we actually do find. All the arrangements of the\r\nflowers--their colour, their form, their honey-guides, their hairy\r\nhoney-paths (Iris), their fragrance, and their honey itself--are all\r\nindirectly useful to the plant itself, because they all co-operate in\r\ncompelling the honey-seeking insect to effect the fertilization of\r\nthe flower. This is most clearly seen in the case of the so-called\r\n'Deceptive' flowers, which attract insects by their size and beauty,\r\ntheir fragrance, and their resemblance to other flowers, and force\r\ntheir visitors to be the means of their cross-fertilization, although\r\nthey contain no nectar at all. This is the case, according to Hermann\r\nMüller, with the most beautiful of our indigenous orchids, the lady's\r\nslipper (_Cypripedium calceolaris_). This flower is visited by bees\r\nof the genus _Andrena_, which creep into the large wooden-shoe-shaped\r\nunder lip in the search for honey, only to find themselves prisoners,\r\nfor they cannot get out, at least by the way they came in, because of\r\nthe steep and smoothly polished walls of the flower. There is only one\r\nway for the bee; it must force itself under the stigma, which it can\r\nonly do with great exertion, and not without being smeared with pollen,\r\nwhich it carries to the next flower into which it creeps. It can only\r\nleave this one in the same way, and thus the pollen is transferred to\r\nthe stigma by a mechanical necessity.\r\n\r\nSuch remarkable cases remind us in some ways of those cases of mimicry\r\nin which the deceptions have to be used with caution or they lose their\r\neffect. One might be disposed to imagine that such an intelligent\r\ninsect as a bee would not be deceived by the lady's slipper more than\r\nonce, and would not creep into a second flower after discovering that\r\nthere was no nectar in the first. But this conclusion is not correct,\r\nfor the bees are well accustomed in many flowers to find that the\r\nnectar has already been taken by other bees; they could therefore not\r\nconclude from one unsuccessful visit that the _Cypripedium_ did not\r\nproduce nectar at all, but would try again in a second, a third, and a\r\nfourth flower. If these orchids had abundantly covered flower-spikes\r\nlike many species of _Orchis_, and if the species were common, the bees\r\nwould probably soon learn not to visit them, but the reverse is the\r\ncase. There is usually only one or, at most, two open flowers on the\r\nlady's slipper, and the plant is rare, and probably occurs nowhere in\r\nlarge numbers.\r\n\r\nIf we could find a flower in which the nectar lay open and accessible\r\nto all insects, and which did not require any service from them\r\nin return, the case could not be interpreted in terms of natural\r\nselection; but we do not know of any such case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. The Yucca-moth (_Pronuba yuccasella_). _M_,\r\nlaying eggs in the ovary of the Yucca flower. _n_, the stigma. After\r\nRiley.]\r\n\r\nConversely, too, there are no adaptations in the insects which are\r\nuseful only to the flowers, and which are not of some use, directly or\r\nindirectly, to the insect itself. Bees and butterflies certainly carry\r\nthe pollen from one flower to the stigma of another, but they are not\r\nimpelled to do this by a special instinct; they are forced to do it\r\nby the structure of the flower, which has its stamens so placed and\r\narranged that they must shake their pollen over the visitor, or it may\r\nbe that the anthers are modified into stalked, viscid pollinia which\r\nspring off at a touch, and fix themselves, so to speak, on the insect's\r\nhead. And even this is not all in the case of the orchis, for the\r\ninsect would never of its own accord transfer these pollinia on to the\r\nstigma of the next flower; this is effected by the physical peculiarity\r\nwhich causes the pollinia, after a short time, to bend forwards on the\r\ninsect's head.\r\n\r\nAll this fits in as well as possible with the hypothesis: how could an\r\ninstinct to carry pollen from one flower to the stigma of another have\r\nbeen developed in an insect through natural selection, since the insect\r\nitself has nothing to gain from this proceeding? Accordingly, we never\r\nfind in the insect any pincers or any kind of grasping organ adapted\r\nfor seizing and transmitting the pollen.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one very remarkable case in which this appears to\r\nbe so, indeed really is so, and nevertheless it is not contradictory\r\nto, but is corroborative of, the theory of selection. The excellent\r\nAmerican entomologist, Riley, established by means of careful\r\nobservations that the large white flowers of the Yucca are fertilized\r\nby a little moth which behaves in a manner otherwise unheard of among\r\ninsects. Only the females visit the flowers, and they at once busy\r\nthemselves collecting a large ball of pollen. To this end they have\r\non the maxillary palps (Fig. 52, _C_, _mxp_) a long process (_si_),\r\ncurved in the form of a sickle, and covered with hairs, which probably\r\nno other Lepidopteron possesses, with the help of which the moth\r\nvery quickly sweeps together a ball of pollen, it may be three times\r\nthe size of her own head. With this ball the insect flies to the\r\nnext flower, and there she lays her egg, by means of an ovipositor\r\notherwise unknown among Lepidoptera (Fig. 52, _A_, _op_), in the pods\r\nof the flower. Finally, she pushes the ball of pollen deep into the\r\nfunnel-shaped stigmatic opening on the pistil (Fig. 51, _n_), and so\r\neffects the cross-fertilization. The ovules develop, and when the\r\ncaterpillars emerge from the egg four to five days later they feed on\r\nthese until they are ready to enter on the pupa stage. Each little\r\ncaterpillar requires about eighteen or twenty seeds for its nourishment\r\n(Fig. 52, _B_, _r_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. The fertilization of the Yucca. _A_, ovipositor\r\nof the Yucca-moth. _op_, its sheath. _sp_, its apex. _op_^1, the\r\nprotruded oviduct. _B_, two ovaries of the Yucca, showing the holes by\r\nwhich the young moths escape, and (_r_) a caterpillar in the interior.\r\n_C_, head of the female moth, with the sickle-shaped process (_si_) on\r\nthe maxillary palps for sweeping off the pollen and rolling it into a\r\nball. _mx_^1, the proboscis. _au_, eye. _p_^1 base of first leg. _D_,\r\nlongitudinal section through an ovary of the Yucca, soon after the\r\nlaying of two eggs (_ei_). _stk_, the canal made by the ovipositor.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find an adaptation of certain parts of the moth's body\r\nin relation to the fertilization of the flower, but in this case it is\r\nas much in the interest of the moth as of the plant. By carrying the\r\npollen to the stigma the moths secure the development of the ovules,\r\nwhich serve their offspring as food, so that we have here to do with\r\na peculiar form of care for offspring, which is not more remarkable\r\nthan many other kinds of brood-care in insects, such as ants, bees,\r\nSphex-wasps, ichneumon-flies, and gall-flies.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected that this case of the Yucca is not so much one\r\nof effecting fertilization as of parasitism; but the eggs, which are\r\nlaid in the seed-pods, are very few, and the caterpillars which emerge\r\nfrom them only devour a very small proportion of the seeds, of which\r\nthere may be about 200 (Fig. 52, _B_). Thus the plants also derive\r\nan advantage from the moth's procedure, for quite enough seeds are\r\nleft. The form and position of the stamens and of the stigma seem to\r\nbe as exactly adapted to the visits of the moth as the moth is to the\r\ntransference of the pollen, for the Yucca can only be fertilized by\r\nthis one moth, and sets no seed if the moth be absent. For this reason\r\nthe species of Yucca cultivated in Europe remain sterile.\r\n\r\nThus the apparent contradiction is explained, and the facts everywhere\r\nsupport the hypothesis that the adaptations between flowers and insects\r\ndepend upon processes of selection.\r\n\r\nThis origin is incontrovertibly proved, it seems to me, in another way,\r\nnamely, by the merely _relative_ perfection of the adaptations, or\r\nrather, by their relative imperfection.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that all adaptations which depend upon\r\nnatural selection can only be relatively perfect, as follows from the\r\nnature of their efficient causes, for natural selection only operates\r\nas long as a further increase of the character concerned would be of\r\nadvantage to the existence of the species. It cannot be operative\r\nbeyond this point, because the existence of the species cannot be more\r\nperfectly secured in this direction, or, to speak more precisely,\r\nbecause further variations in the direction hitherto followed would no\r\nlonger be improvements, even though they might appear so to us.\r\n\r\nThus the corolla of many flowers is suited to the thick, hairy head\r\nand thorax of the bee, for to these only does the pollen adhere in\r\nsufficient quantity to fertilize the next flower; yet the same flowers\r\nare frequently visited by butterflies, and in many of them there\r\nhas been no adaptation to prevent these useless visits. Obviously\r\nthis is because preventive arrangements could only begin, according\r\nto our theory, when they were necessary to the preservation of the\r\nspecies; in this case, therefore, only when the pillaging visits\r\nof the butterflies withdrew so many flowers from the influence of\r\nthe effective pollinating visitor, the bee, that too few seeds were\r\nformed, and the survival of the species was threatened by the continual\r\ndwindling of the normal number. As long as the bees visit the flowers\r\nfrequently enough to ensure the formation of the necessary number of\r\nseeds a process of selection could not set in; but should the bees\r\nfind, for instance, that nearly all the flowers had been robbed of\r\ntheir nectar, and should therefore visit them less diligently, then\r\nevery variation of the flower which made honey less accessible to the\r\nbutterflies would become the objective of a process of selection.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we find similar imperfections of adaptation which indicate\r\nthat they must depend on processes of selection. Thus numerous flowers\r\nare visited by insects other than those which pollinate them, and these\r\nbring them no advantage, but merely rob them of nectar and pollen;\r\nthe most beautiful contrivances of many flowers, such as _Glycinia_,\r\nwhich are directed towards cross-fertilization by bees, are rendered\r\nof no effect because wood-bees and humble-bees bite holes into the\r\nnectaries from the outside, and so reach the nectar by the shortest\r\nway. I do not know whether bees in the native land of the _Glycinia_\r\ndo the same thing, but in any case they can do no sensible injury to\r\nthe species, since otherwise processes of selection would have set in\r\nwhich would have prevented the damage in some way or other, whether by\r\nthe production of stinging-hairs, or hairs with a burning secretion, or\r\nin some other way. If the actual constitution of the plant made this\r\nimpossible, the species would become less abundant and would gradually\r\ndie out.\r\n\r\nThus the relative imperfection of the flower-adaptations, which in\r\ngeneral are so worthy of admiration, affords a further indication that\r\ntheir origin is due to processes of selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTE TO CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the chapter on the Origin of Flowers in the\r\nGerman Edition contains no discussion and refutation of the objections\r\nwhich have up till recently been urged against the theory of flowers\r\npropounded by Darwin and Hermann Müller. I admit that this chapter\r\nseemed to be so harmonious and so well rounded, and at the same time so\r\nconvincing as to the reality of the processes of selection, that the\r\nfeeble objections to it, and the attempts of opponents to find another\r\nexplanation of the phenomena, might well be disregarded in this book.\r\n\r\nHowever, the most important of these objections and counter-theories\r\nmay here be briefly mentioned.\r\n\r\nPlateau in Ghent was the first to collect _facts_ which appeared to\r\ncontradict the Darwinian theory of flowers; he observed that insects\r\navoided _artificial_ flowers, even when they were indistinguishable\r\nin colour from natural ones as far as our eyes could perceive, and he\r\nconcluded from this that it is not the colour which guides the insects\r\nto the flowers, that they find the blossoms less by their sense of\r\nsight than by their sense of smell. But great caution is required\r\nin drawing conclusions from experiments of this kind. I once placed\r\nartificial marguerites (_Chrysanthemum leucanthemum_) among natural\r\nones in a roomy frame in the open air, and for a considerable time I\r\nwas unable to see any of the numerous butterflies (_Vanessa urticæ_),\r\nwhich were flying about the real chrysanthemums, settle on one of the\r\nartificial flowers. The insects often flew quite close to them without\r\npaying them the least attention, and I was inclined to conclude that\r\nthey either perceived the difference at sight, or that they missed the\r\nodour of the natural flowers in the artificial ones. But in the course\r\nof a few days it happened twice in my presence that a butterfly settled\r\non one of the artificial blooms and _persistently groped about with\r\nfully outstretched tube to find the entrance to the honey_. It was only\r\nafter prolonged futile attempts that it desisted and flew away. That\r\nbees are guided by the eye in their visits to flowers has been shown by\r\nA. Forel, who cut off the whole proboscis, together with the antennæ,\r\nfrom humble-bees which were swarming eagerly about the flowers. He thus\r\nrobbed them of the whole apparatus of smell, and nevertheless they flew\r\ndown from a considerable height direct to the same flowers. An English\r\nobserver, Mr. G. N. Bulman, has been led to believe, with Plateau, that\r\nit is a matter of entire indifference to the bees whether the flowers\r\nare blue, or red, or simply green in colour, if only they contain\r\nhoney, and that therefore the bees could have played no part in the\r\ndevelopment of blue flowers, as Hermann Müller assumed they had, and\r\nthat they could have no preference for blue or any other colour, as Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock and others had concluded from their experiments. This is\r\ncorrect in so far that bees feed as eagerly on the greenish blossoms of\r\nthe lime-tree as they do on the deep-blue gentian of the Alpine meadows\r\nor the red blossoms of the Weigelia, the dog-roses of our gardens or\r\nthe yellow buttercups (_Ranunculus_) of our meadows; they despise\r\nnothing that yields them honey. But it certainly does not follow\r\nfrom this that the bees may not, under certain circumstances, have\r\nexercised a selecting influence upon the fixation and intensification\r\nof a new colour-variety of a flower. This is less a question of a\r\n_colour-preference_, in the human sense, on the part of the bees\r\nthan of the _greater visibility_ of the colour in question in the\r\nenvironment peculiar to the flower, and of the amount of rivalry the\r\nbees meet with from other insects in regard to the same flower. In\r\nindividual cases this would be difficult to demonstrate, especially\r\nsince we can form only an approximate idea of the insect's power of\r\nseeing colour, and cannot judge what the colours of the individual\r\nblossoms count for in the mosaic picture of a flowery meadow. Yet this\r\nis the important point, for, as soon as the bees perceive one colour\r\nmore readily than another, the preponderance of this colour-variety\r\nover other variations is assured, since it will be more frequently\r\nvisited. In the same way we cannot guess in individual cases why one\r\nspecies of flower should exhale perfume while a nearly related species\r\ndoes not. But when we remember that many flowers adapted for the visits\r\nof dipterous insects possess a nauseous carrion-like smell, by means\r\nof which they not only attract flies but scare off other insects, we\r\ncan readily imagine cases in which it was of importance to a flower\r\nto be able to be easily found by bees without betraying itself by its\r\npleasant fragrance to other less desirable visitors.\r\n\r\nThus, therefore, we can understand the odourless but intensely blue\r\nspecies of gentian, if we may assume that its blue colour is more\r\nvisible to bees than to other insects. If I were to elaborate in\r\ndetail all the principles which here suggest themselves to me I should\r\nrequire to write a complete section, and I am unwilling to do this\r\nuntil I can bring forward a much larger number of new observations\r\nthan I am at present in a position to do. All I wish to do here is\r\nto exhort doubters to modesty, and to remind them that these matters\r\nare exceedingly complex, and that we should be glad and grateful that\r\nexpert observers like Darwin and Hermann Müller have given us some\r\ninsight into the principles interconnecting the facts, instead of\r\nimagining whenever we meet with some little apparently contradictory\r\nfact, which may indeed be quite correct in itself, that the whole\r\ntheory of the development of flowers through insects has been\r\noverthrown. Let us rather endeavour to understand such facts, and to\r\narrange them in their places as stones of the new building.\r\n\r\nOften the contradiction is merely the result of the imperfect\r\ntheoretical conceptions of its discoverer, as we have already shown in\r\nregard to Nägeli. Bulman, too, fancies he has proved that bees do not\r\ndistinguish between the different varieties of a flower, but visit them\r\nindiscriminately with the same eagerness, thus causing intercrossing\r\nof all the varieties, and preventing any one from becoming dominant.\r\nBut are the varieties which we plant side by side in our gardens of the\r\nkind that are evolved by bees? That is to say, are their _differences\r\nsuch as will turn the scale for or against the visits of the bees_?\r\nIf one were less, another more easily seen by the bees; or if one\r\nwere more fragrant, or had a fragrance more agreeable to bees than\r\nthe other, the result of the experiment would probably have been very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nOne more objection has been made. It is said that the bees, although\r\nexclusively restricted, both themselves and their descendants, to\r\na diet of flowers, are not so constant _to a particular flower_ as\r\nthe theory requires. They do indeed exhibit a 'considerable amount\r\nof constancy,' and often visit a large number of flowers of the same\r\nspecies in succession, but the theory requires that they should\r\nnot only confine themselves to this one species, but to a _single\r\nvariety_ of this species. These views show that their authors have not\r\npenetrated far towards an understanding of the nature of selection.\r\nNature does not operate with individual flowers, but with millions and\r\nmyriads of them, and not with the flowers of a single spring, but with\r\nthose of hundreds and thousands of years. How often a particular bee\r\nmay carry pollen uselessly to a strange flower without thereby lowering\r\nthe aggregate of seeds so far that the existence of the species seems\r\nimperilled, or how often she may fertilize the pistil of a useful\r\nvariation with the pollen of the parent species, without interrupting\r\nor hindering the process of the evolution of the variety, no mortal\r\ncan calculate, and what the theory requires can only be formulated in\r\nthis way: The constancy of the bees in their visits to the flowers must\r\nbe so great that, on an average, the quantity of seeds will be formed\r\nwhich suffices for the preservation of the species. And in regard\r\nto the transformation of a species, the attraction which the useful\r\nvariety has for the bees must, on an average, be _somewhat stronger_\r\nthan that of the parent species. As soon as this is the case the seeds\r\nof the variety will be formed in preponderant numbers, although they\r\nmay not all be quite pure from the first, and by degrees, in the course\r\nof generations, the plants of the new variety will preponderate more\r\nand more over those of the parent form, and finally will alone remain.\r\nIn the first case we have before our eyes the proof that, in spite of\r\nthe imperfect constancy of the bees, a sufficient number of seeds is\r\nproduced to secure the existence of the species. Or does Mr. Bulman\r\nconclude from the fact that the bees are _not absolutely constant_ that\r\nflowers are not fertilized by bees at all?\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this note without touching briefly upon what the\r\nopponents of the flower theory have contributed, and what explanation\r\nof the facts they are prepared to offer.\r\n\r\nIn his important work, _Mechanische-physiologische Theorie der\r\nAbstammungslehre_, published in 1884, Nägeli, as a convinced opponent\r\nof the theory of selection, attempted an explanation. He was quite\r\naware that his assumption of an inward 'perfecting principle' would not\r\nsuffice to explain the mutual adaptations of flowers and insects, and\r\nhe refers the transformation of the first inconspicuous blossoms into\r\nflowers to the mechanical stimulus which the visiting insects exerted\r\nupon the parts of the blossom. By the pressure of their footsteps,\r\nthe pushing and probing with their proboscis, they have, he says,\r\ntransformed gradually, for instance, the little covering leaves at the\r\nbase of a pollen vessel into large flower petals, caused the conversion\r\nof short flower-tubes into long ones, and of the pollen, once dry and\r\ndusty, into the firmly adhesive mass formed in the anther lobes of\r\nour modern flowers. The colour of the flowers depends, according to\r\nhim, upon the influence of light, which certainly no more explains the\r\nyellow ring on a blue ground in the forget-me-not than it does the many\r\nother nectar-guides which show the insect the way to the honey. Nägeli\r\nworks with the Lamarckian principle in the most daring way, and with\r\nthe same _naïveté_ as Lamarck himself in his time, that is, without\r\noffering any sort of explanation as to how the minute impression made,\r\nsay by the foot or by the proboscis of an insect, upon a flower, is to\r\nbe handed on to the flowers of succeeding generations. He treats the\r\nunending chain of generations as if it were a single individual, and\r\noperates with his 'secular' stimulus, and with 'weak stimuli, lasting\r\nthrough countless generations,' as though they were a proved fact. But\r\nI have not even touched upon the question as to whether these 'stimuli'\r\ncould produce the changes he ascribes to them, even if they were\r\ncontinually affecting the flower. How the scale-like covering leaves\r\nof the pollen vessels could become larger and petal-like through the\r\ntreading of an insect's foot is as difficult to see as why a honey-tube\r\nshould _become longer_ because of the butterfly's honey-sucking: might\r\nit not just as well become _wider_, _narrower_, or even _shorter_? I\r\nsee no convincing reason why it should become _longer_! And even if\r\nit did so, it would necessarily continue to lengthen as time went on,\r\nand this is not the case, for we find corolla-tubes of all possible\r\nlengths, but, _it is to be noted, always in harmony with the length of\r\nthe proboscis of the visiting insect_. In a similar way Henslow has\r\nrecently attempted to refer the origin of flowers to the mechanical\r\nstimulus exercised upon it by the visiting insects. 'An insect hanging\r\nto the lower petal of a flower elongates the same by its weight, and\r\nthe lengthened petal is transmitted by heredity.'...'The irritation\r\ncaused by its feet in walking along the flower causes the appearance\r\nof colouring matter, and the colour is likewise transmitted.'...'As it\r\nprobes for honey it causes a flow of sweet sap to that part, and this\r\nalso becomes hereditary!'\r\n\r\nIn this case, also, it is simply taken for granted that every little\r\npassing irritation not only produces a perceptible effect, but that\r\nthis effect is transmissible. In a later lecture we shall have to\r\ndiscuss in detail the question of the inheritance of functional\r\nmodifications. It is enough to say here that, if this kind of\r\ntransmission really took place even in the case of such minute and\r\ntransitory changes, there could be no dispute as to the correctness\r\nof the 'Lamarckian principle,' since every fairly strong and lasting\r\nirritation could be demonstrated with certainty to produce an effect.\r\nWhen a butterfly, floating freely in the air, sucks honey from a tube,\r\nthe irritation must be almost analogous to that caused by a comb\r\nlightly drawn by some one through our hair, and this is supposed to\r\neffect the gradual lengthening of the corolla-tube of the flower!\r\n\r\nThe secretion of honey, too, depends upon the persistent irritation\r\nof the proboscis! Then 'deceptive flowers,' like the Cypripedium we\r\nhave mentioned, could not exist at all, for they contain no honey,\r\nalthough the proboscis of the bee must cause the same irritation in\r\nthem as in other orchids which do contain honey. This whole 'theory' of\r\ndirect effect is, moreover, only a crude and apparent interpretation,\r\nwhich explains the conditions only in so far as they can be seen from\r\na distance; it fails as soon as they are more exactly examined; all\r\nthe great differences in the position of the honey, its concealment\r\nfrom intelligent insects, its protection from rain by means of hairs,\r\nand against unwelcome guests by a sticky secretion, the development\r\nof a corolla-tube which corresponds in length to the length of the\r\nvisiting insect's proboscis, the development of spurs on the flower,\r\nin short, all the numerous contrivances which have reference to\r\ncross-fertilization by insects remain quite unintelligible in the light\r\nof this theory--it is a mere _pis aller_ explanation for those who\r\ncontinue to struggle against accepting the theory of selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XI\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION\r\n\r\n Decorative colouring of male butterflies and birds--Wallace's\r\n interpretation--Preponderance of males--Choice of the females--Sense\r\n by sight in butterflies--Attractive odours--Scent-scales--Fragrance of\r\n the females--The limits of natural and sexual selection not clearly\r\n defined--Odours of particular species--Odours of other animals at\r\n the breeding season--Song of the Cicadas, and of birds--Diversity\r\n of decoration successively acquired--Humming-birds--Substitution\r\n of other aids to wooing in place of personal decoration--Smelling\r\n organs of male insects and crabs--Contrivances for seizing and\r\n holding the female--Small size of certain males--Weapons of males\r\n used in struggle for the females--Turban eyes of Ephemerids--Hoods\r\n that can be inflated on the head of birds--Absence of secondary\r\n sexual characters in lower animals--Transference of male characters\r\n to the females--Lycæna--Parrots--Fashion operative in the phyletic\r\n modifications of colour--Pattern of markings on the upper surface of a\r\n butterfly's wing simpler than on the under side--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE found in the process of Natural Selection an explanation of\r\nnumerous effective adaptations in plants and animals, as regards form,\r\ncolouring, and metabolism, of the most diverse weapons and protective\r\ndevices, of the existence of those forms of blossoms which we call\r\nflowers, of instincts, and so on. The origin of the most characteristic\r\nparts of whole orders of insects can only be understood as adaptations\r\nto the environment brought about by means of natural selection.\r\nImpressed by this, we have now to ask whether _all_ the transformations\r\nof organisms may not be referred to adaptation to the continually\r\nchanging conditions of life? We shall return to this question later,\r\nbut in the meantime we are far from being able to answer it in the\r\naffirmative, for there are undoubtedly a great many characters, at\r\nleast in animals, which cannot have owed their origin to natural\r\nselection in the form in which we have studied it so far.\r\n\r\nHow could the splendid plumage of the humming-birds, of the pheasants,\r\nof the parrots, the wonderful colour-patterns of so many diurnal\r\nbutterflies, be referred to the process of natural selection, since all\r\nthese characters can have no significance for their possessors in the\r\nstruggle for existence? Or of what use in the struggle for existence\r\ncould the possession of its gorgeous dress of feathers be to the bird\r\nof Paradise; or of what service is the azure blue iridescence of the\r\n_Morpho_ of Brazil, which makes it conspicuous from a distance when\r\nit plays about the crowns of the palm-trees? We might indeed suppose\r\nthat they are warning signs of unpalatableness, like those of the\r\nHeliconiides or of the gaily coloured caterpillars, but, in the first\r\nplace, these gay creatures are by no means inedible, and are indeed\r\nmuch persecuted; and, secondly, the females have quite different and\r\nvery much darker and simpler colours. The gleaming splendour of all\r\nthese birds of Paradise and humming-birds, as well as that of many\r\nbutterflies, is found in the male sex only. The females of the birds\r\njust mentioned are dark in colour and without the sparkling decorative\r\nfeathers of the males; they are plain--just like the females of many\r\nbutterflies. Alfred Russel Wallace has suggested that the explanation\r\nof this lies in the greater need of the females for protection, since,\r\nas is well known, they usually perform the labours of brooding, and are\r\nthus frequently exposed to the attacks of enemies. It is undoubtedly\r\ntrue that the dark and inconspicuous colouring of many birds and\r\nbutterflies depends on this need for protection, but this does not\r\nexplain the brilliant colours of the males of these species. Or can it\r\nbe that these require no explanation further than that they are, so to\r\nspeak, a chance secondary outcome of the structural relations of the\r\nfeathers and wing-scales respectively, which brought with it some other\r\nadvantage not known to us? Perhaps something in the same way as the red\r\ncolour of the blood in all vertebrates, from fishes upwards, cannot be\r\nuseful on the ground that it appears red to us, but because it is the\r\nexpression of the chemical constitution of the hæmoglobin, a body which\r\nis indispensable to the metabolism, which here has the secondary and\r\nintrinsically quite unimportant peculiarity of reflecting the red rays\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nNo one can seriously believe this in regard to butterflies who knows\r\nthat their colours are dependent on the scales which thickly cover the\r\nwings, and the significance of which, in part at least, is just to give\r\nthis or that colour to the wing. They are degenerate or colourless\r\namong the transparent-winged butterflies, and their colour depends\r\npartly on pigment, partly on fluorescence and interference conditioned\r\nby the fine microscopical structure of a system of intercrossing lines\r\non faintly coloured scales. The scales of our male 'blue' butterflies\r\n(_Lycæna_) only appear blue because of their structure, while the brown\r\nscales of their mates are due to a brown pigment. If the pigment be\r\nremoved from the scales of the female by boiling with caustic potash,\r\nand they be then dried, they do not look blue like those of the male;\r\nthe scales of the male, therefore, must possess something which those\r\nof the female do not.\r\n\r\nStill less will any one be disposed to regard the marvellous splendour\r\nof the plumage of the male bird of Paradise, with its erectile\r\ncollars--glistening like burnished metal--on the neck, breast or\r\nshoulders, with its tufts, with its specially decorative feathers\r\nstanding singly out from the rest of the plumage, on head, wings, or\r\ntail, with its mane-like bunch of loose, pendulous feathers on the\r\nbelly and on the sides, in short, with its extraordinary, diverse, and\r\nunique equipment of feathers, as a mere unintentional accessory effect\r\nof a feather dress designed for flight and protective warmth. Such\r\nconspicuous, diverse, and unusual specializations of plumage must have\r\nsome other significance than that just indicated.\r\n\r\nAlfred Russel Wallace regards these distinctive features of the male\r\nas an expression of the greater vigour, and the more active metabolism\r\nof the males, but it is unproved that the vigour of the male birds\r\nis greater than that of the females, and it is not easy to see why\r\na more active metabolism should be necessary for the production of\r\nstrikingly bright colours than for that of a dark or protective colour.\r\nMoreover, there are brilliantly coloured females, both among birds\r\nand butterflies, and in nearly allied species the males may be either\r\ngorgeous or quite plain like the females.\r\n\r\nDarwin refers the origin of these secondary sexual characters to\r\nprocesses of selection quite analogous to those of ordinary natural\r\nselection, only that in this case it is not the maintenance of the\r\nspecies which is aimed at, but the attainment of reproduction by the\r\nsingle individual. The males are to some extent obliged to struggle\r\nfor the possession of the females, and every little variation which\r\nenables a male to gain possession of a female more readily than his\r\nneighbour has for this reason a greater likelihood of being transmitted\r\nto descendants. Thus, attractive variations which once crop up will be\r\ntransmitted to more and more numerous males of the species, and among\r\nthese it will always be those possessing the character in question\r\nin the highest degree which will have the best chance of securing a\r\nmate, and so the character will continue to be augmented as long as\r\nvariations in this direction appear.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of preliminary conditions, however, must be assumed. As the\r\nordinary natural selection could never have operated but for the fact\r\nthat in every generation a great many individuals, indeed the majority\r\nof them, perish before they have had time to reproduce, so the process\r\nof sexual selection could never have come into operation if every\r\nmale were able ultimately to secure a mate, no matter what degree of\r\nattractiveness to the latter he possessed. If the numbers of males and\r\nfemales were equal, so that there was always one female to one male,\r\nthere could be no choice exercised either by male or female, for there\r\nwould always remain individuals enough of both sexes, so that no male\r\nneed remain unmated.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the case: the proportions of the sexes are very rarely\r\nas 1 : 1; there is usually a preponderating number of males, more\r\nrarely of females. Among birds the males are usually in the majority,\r\nstill more so among fishes; and among diurnal butterflies there are\r\noften a hundred males to one female (Bates), although there seem to\r\nbe a few tropical Papilionidæ among which the females have rather the\r\npreponderance. Darwin called attention to the fact that one could\r\ninfer the greater rarity of the females even from the pricelists of\r\nbutterflies issued by the late Dr. Staudinger in connexion with his\r\nbusiness, for the females in most species, except the very common ones,\r\nare priced much higher than the males, often twice as high. In the\r\nwhole list of many thousands of species there are only eleven species\r\nof nocturnal Lepidoptera in which the males are dearer than the females.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mayflies or Ephemerides, too, the males are in the majority;\r\nin many of them there are sixty males to one female: but there are\r\nother kinds of insects, such as the dragon-flies (Libellulidæ), in\r\nwhich the females are three or four times as numerous. There are also,\r\nit may be remembered, some kinds of insects, such as Aphides, which\r\nhave become capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, and in which the\r\nmales are becoming extinct, e.g. in the case of _Cerataphis_ in British\r\norchid-houses.\r\n\r\nThe first postulate implied in 'sexual selection,' namely, that there\r\nbe an unequal number of individuals in the two sexes, is therefore\r\nfulfilled in Nature; we have now to inquire whether the second\r\ncondition postulated--the power of choice--may also be regarded as a\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nThis point has been disputed from many sides, and even by one of the\r\nfounders of the whole selection theory, Alfred Russel Wallace. This\r\nnaturalist doubts whether a choice is exercised among birds by either\r\nsex in regard to pairing, and maintains that, even if there could be\r\na choice, this could not have produced such differences in colour and\r\ncharacter of the plumage, since that would presuppose the existence of\r\nsimilar taste in the females through many generations. In a similar way\r\nit has been doubted whether butterflies can be said to exercise any\r\nreal power of sexual choice, whether a more beautiful male is as such\r\npreferred to a less beautiful suitor.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that direct observation of choosing is difficult,\r\nand that as yet there is very little that can be said with certainty\r\non this point. But there are, after all, some precise observations on\r\nmammals and birds which prove that the female shows active inclination\r\nto, or disinclination for, a particular male. If we hold fast to\r\nthis fact, and add to it that the distinctive markings of the males\r\nare wonderfully developed during the period of courtship, and are\r\ndisplayed before the females, and that they only appear in mammals,\r\nbirds, amphibians, and fishes at the time of sexual maturity, it seems\r\nto me that there can be no doubt that they are intended to fascinate\r\nthe females, and to induce them to yield themselves to the males. The\r\nopponents of the theory of sexual selection attach too much importance\r\nto isolated cases; they imagine that each female must make a choice\r\nbetween several males. But the theory of sexual selection does not\r\ndemand this, any more than the theory of natural selection requires the\r\nassumption that every individual of a species which is better equipped\r\nfor the struggle for existence must necessarily survive and attain\r\nto reproduction, or, conversely, that the less well equipped must\r\nnecessarily perish.\r\n\r\nAll that the theory requires is, that the selective and eliminative\r\nprocesses do, _on an average_, secure their ends, and in the same way\r\nthe theory of sexual selection does not need the assumption that every\r\nfemale is in a position to exercise a scrupulous choice from among a\r\ntroop of males, but only that, on an average, the males more agreeable\r\nto the females are selected, and those less agreeable rejected. If this\r\nis the case, it must result in the male characters most attractive to\r\nthe females gaining preponderance, and becoming more and more firmly\r\nestablished in the species, increasing in intensity, and finally\r\nbecoming a stable possession of all the males.\r\n\r\nWhen we go more into details we shall see that the _particular\r\nqualities_ of the distinctive masculine characters are exactly such as\r\nthey would be if they owed their existence to processes of selection;\r\nin other words, from this point of view the phenomena of the decorative\r\nsexual characters can be understood up to a certain point. It seems\r\nto me that we are bound to accept the process of sexual selection as\r\nreally operative, and instead of throwing doubt upon it, because the\r\nchoice of the females can rarely be directly established, we should\r\nrather deduce from the numerous sexual characters of the males, which\r\nhave a significance only in relation to courtship, that the females of\r\nthe species are sensitive to these distinguishing characters, and are\r\nreally capable of exercising a choice.\r\n\r\nIn my mind at least there remains no doubt that the 'sexual selection'\r\nof Darwin is an important factor in the transformation of species, even\r\nif I only take into consideration those secondary sexual characters\r\nwhich are related to wooing. We shall see, however, that there are\r\nothers in regard to whose origin through processes of selection doubt\r\nis still less legitimate, and from which, on this account, we can argue\r\nback to the courtship characters.\r\n\r\nThe first beginning of transformation is not, even in ordinary natural\r\nselection, to be understood as due to selection, but is to be regarded\r\nas _a given variation_ (the causes of which we shall discuss later on);\r\nit is only the increase of such incipient variations in a definite\r\ndirection that can depend on natural selection, and they _must_ depend\r\non it in so far as the transformations are purposeful. Now, all\r\nsecondary sexual characters can be recognized as useful, save only the\r\ndecorative distinctions, although these also undoubtedly represent\r\nintensifications of originally unimportant variations. Are we then\r\nto regard these alone as the mere outcome of the internal impulsive\r\nforces of the organism, while in the case of the analogous sexual\r\ncharacters for tracking, catching, and holding the female, and so\r\nforth, the augmentation and the directing must be referred to processes\r\nof selection? But if there be any utility at all in the decorative\r\nsexual characters it can only lie in their greater attractiveness to\r\nthe females, and it can only be of any account if the females have,\r\nin a certain sense, the power of choice. Independently, therefore, of\r\ndirect observations as to the actual occurrence of choosing, we should\r\nbe compelled by our chain of reasoning to assume that there was such a\r\npower of choice--and I shall immediately discuss it more precisely.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the decorative, distinctive characters of the males more\r\nclosely, we find that they are of very diverse kinds. The males of many\r\nanimals are distinguished from the females chiefly by greater beauty\r\nof form, and especially of colour. This is the case in many birds,\r\nsome amphibians, like the water-salamander, many fishes, many insects,\r\nand above all, in diurnal Lepidoptera. Especially among birds the\r\ndimorphism between the sexes is in obvious relation to the excess in\r\nthe number of male individuals, or--what practically comes to the same\r\nthing--to polygamy. For when a male attaches to himself four or ten\r\nfemales the result is the same as if the number of female individuals\r\nwere divided by four or by ten. Thus the fowls and pheasants, which\r\nare polygamous, are adorned by magnificent colours in the male sex,\r\nwhile the monogamous partridges and quails exhibit the same colouring\r\nin both sexes. Of course 'beautiful' is a relative term, and we must\r\nnot simply assume that what seems beautiful to us appears so to all\r\nanimals; yet when we see that all the male birds which are beautifully\r\ndecorative according to our taste--whether humming-birds, pheasants,\r\nbirds of Paradise, or rock-cocks (_Rupicola crocea_)--unfold their\r\n'feather-wheels, 'fans,' 'collars,' and so forth, before the eyes of\r\nthe females in the breeding season, and display them in all their\r\nbrilliance, we must conclude that, in these instances at least, human\r\ntaste accords with that of the animals. That birds have sharp vision\r\nand distinguish colours is well known; it is not for nothing that the\r\nservice berries and many other berries suitable for birds are red, the\r\nmistletoe berries white, in contrast to the evergreen foliage of this\r\nplant, the juniper berries black so that they stand out amid the snows\r\nof winter; in this direction, then, there is no difficulty in the way\r\nof sexual selection.\r\n\r\nEven among much lower animals, like the butterflies, there seems to me\r\nno reason for the assumption that they do not see the gorgeous colours\r\nand often very complicated markings, the bars and eye-spots, on the\r\nwings of their fellows of the same species. Of course if each facet of\r\nthe insect eye contributed only a single visual impression, as Johannes\r\nMüller supposed, then even an eye with 12,000 facets would give but a\r\nrough and ill-defined picture of objects more than a few feet away, and\r\nI confess that for a long time I regarded this as an obstacle in the\r\nway of referring the sexual dimorphism of butterflies to processes of\r\nselection. But we now know, through Exner, that this is not the case;\r\nwe know that each facet gives a little picture, and not an 'inverted'\r\nbut an 'upright' one, and experiment with the excised insect eye has\r\ndirectly shown that it throws on a photographic plate a tolerably clear\r\nimage of even distant objects, such as the frame of a window, a large\r\nletter painted on the window, or even a church tower visible through it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the structure of the eye allows of incomparably clearer\r\nvision of near objects, for in that case the eyes act like lenses, and\r\nreveal much more minute details than we ourselves are able to make out.\r\nHere again, therefore, there is no obstacle to the Darwinian hypothesis\r\nof a choice on the part of the females, for although it cannot be\r\ndemonstrated from the structure of the eye itself that insects see\r\ncolour, and that colours have a specially exciting influence on them,\r\nyet we can deduce this with certainty from the phenomena of their life.\r\nThe butterflies fly to gaily coloured flowers, and as they find in them\r\ntheir food, the nectar of the flowers, we may take for granted that the\r\nsight of the colour of their food-providing plants is associated with\r\nan agreeable sensation, and this is an indication that similar colours\r\nin their fellows may awaken similar agreeable sensations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. Scent-scales of diurnal butterflies. _a_, of\r\nPieris. _b_, of Argynnis paphia. _c_, of a Satyrid. _d_, of Lycæna. All\r\nhighly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is furthermore confirmed by the fact that, in the male\r\nsex, numerous species of butterfly possess another means of exciting\r\nthe females, namely, by pleasant odours. Volatile ethereal oils are\r\nsecreted by certain cells of the skin, and exhale into the air through\r\nspecially constructed scales. Usually the apparatus for dispersing\r\nfragrance occurs on the wing in the form of the so-called scent-scales\r\n(_Duftschuppen_), peculiar modifications of the ordinary colour-scales\r\nof the wing, but sometimes they take the form of brush-like hair-tufts\r\non the abdomen, and they are in all cases so arranged that the volatile\r\nperfume from the cells of the skin penetrates into them, and then\r\nevaporates through very thin spots on the surface of the scale, or\r\nthrough brush-like, expanded fringes on their tips. Many of these have\r\nlong been known to entomologists, because their divergence in form\r\nfrom the ordinary scales attracted attention; and it was also observed\r\nthat they never occurred on the females, but only on the males. Their\r\nsignificance, however, remained obscure until, by a happy chance, Fritz\r\nMüller, in his Brazilian garden, discovered the fact that there are\r\nbutterflies which give off fragrance like a flower, and then close\r\ninvestigation revealed to him the connexion between this delicate\r\nodour and the so-called 'male scales.' One can convince oneself of the\r\ncorrectness of the observation even in some of our own butterflies by\r\nbrushing the finger over the wing of a newly caught male Garden White\r\n(_Pieris napi_). The finger will be found covered with a white dust,\r\nthe rubbed-off wing-scales, and it will have a delicate perfume of\r\nlemon or balsam, thus proving that the fragrance adheres to the scales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. A portion of the upper surface of the wing of\r\na male 'blue' (_Lycæna menalcas_); after Dr. F. Köhler. _bl_, ordinary\r\nblue scales. _d_, scent-scales. Highly magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. _Zeuxidia wallacei_, male, showing four tufts\r\nof long, bristle-like, bright yellow scent-scales (_d_) on the upper\r\nsurface of the posterior wing.]\r\n\r\nIn the last case, that is, among the Whites (Pieridæ) (Fig. 53, _a_),\r\nthe scent-scales are distributed fairly regularly over the upper\r\nsurface of the wing, and the same is true of our blue butterflies, the\r\nLycænnidæ whose minute lute-shaped scales are shown singly in Fig.\r\n53, _d_, but in their natural position among the ordinary scales in\r\nFig. 54. In many other diurnal, and also in nocturnal Lepidoptera, the\r\nfragrant scales are united into tufts and localized in definite areas.\r\nThey then often form fairly large spots, stripes, or brushes, which\r\nare easily visible to the naked eye. Thus the males of our various\r\nspecies of grass-butterflies (Satyridæ) have velvet-like black spots\r\non the anterior wings, while the fritillary, _Argynnis paphia_, has\r\ncoal-black stripes on four longitudinal ribs of the anterior wing\r\nwhich are absent in the females, and which are composed of hundreds of\r\nodoriferous scales. Certain large forest butterflies of South America,\r\nresembling our _Apatura_, bear in the middle of the gorgeous green\r\nshimmering posterior wing a thick expansible brush of long, bright\r\nyellow scent-scales, and a similar arrangement obtains in the beautiful\r\nviolet butterfly of the Malay Islands, the _Zeuxidia wallacei_ depicted\r\nin Fig. 55. In many of the Danaides, which we have already considered\r\nin relation to mimicry, the scent apparatus is even more perfect, for\r\nit is sunk in a fairly deep pocket on the posterior wings, and in this\r\nthe scent-producing, hair-like scales lie concealed until the butterfly\r\nwishes to allow the fragrance to stream forth. In many South American\r\nand Indian species of _Papilio_ the fragrant hairs are disposed in a\r\nsort of mane on a fold of the edge of the posterior wing, and so on.\r\nThe diversity of these arrangements is extreme, and they are widely\r\ndistributed among both diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera, in the\r\nlatter sometimes in the form of a thick, glistening, white felt which\r\nfills a folded-over portion of the edge of the posterior wing. In many\r\ncases the perfume can be retained, and then, by a sudden turning out\r\nof the wing-fold, be allowed to stream forth. But there are a great\r\nmany species of butterfly which do not possess odoriferous scales, and\r\nthey are often wanting in near relatives of fragrant species; they are\r\nobviously of very late origin, and arose only after the majority of\r\nour modern species were already differentiated. It often seems as if\r\nthey bore a compensatory relation to beauty of colour, somewhat in the\r\nsame way as many modestly coloured flowers develop a strong perfume,\r\nwhile, conversely, many magnificently coloured flowers have no scent at\r\nall. Although among butterflies, as among flowers, there are species\r\nwhich possess both beauty and fragrance, yet our most beautiful diurnal\r\nbutterflies, the Vanessas, the Apaturas, and Limenitis, possess no\r\nscent-scales; and many inconspicuous, that is, protectively coloured\r\nnocturnal Lepidoptera, are strongly fragrant, like most night-flowers:\r\nI need only mention the convolvulus hawk-moth (_Sphinx convolvuli_),\r\nwhose musk-like odour was known to entomologists long before the\r\ndiscovery of scent-scales.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, always only in the males that this odoriferous\r\napparatus is present. It must not be believed on this account that this\r\nfragrance has the significance of a means of attraction comparable to\r\nthe perfume of the flowers which induces butterflies to visit them;\r\nindeed, we cannot assume that the odour carries to a distance, for,\r\nas far as we can make out, it is perceptible only within a very short\r\nradius, and this is indicated also by the manifold arrangements of the\r\nodoriferous organs, which are all calculated to retain the fragrance,\r\nand then--in the immediate neighbourhood of the female--to let it\r\nsuddenly stream forth. Obviously, this arrangement can have no other\r\nsignificance than that of a sexual excitant; its use is to incline the\r\nfemale to the male, to fascinate her, just as do the beautiful colours,\r\nin regard to which we must draw the same inference. It is in this\r\ndirection that the already mentioned relation of compensation between\r\nbeautiful colours and pleasant odours is particularly interesting, for\r\nit confirms our interpretation of the decorative colours as a means of\r\nsexual excitement. The most delicately fragrant or the most beautifully\r\ncoloured males were those which most excited the females, and thus\r\nmost easily attained to reproduction. The expression used by Darwin,\r\nthat the females 'choose,' must be taken metaphorically; they do not\r\nexercise a conscious choice, but they follow the male which excites\r\nthem most strongly. Thus there arises a process of selection among\r\nthese distinctively male characteristics.\r\n\r\nIf the odoriferous organs we have been discussing had merely been a\r\nmeans of attraction, serving to announce the proximity of a member of\r\nthe species, then they should have occurred, not in the males but in\r\nthe females, for these are sought out by the males, not conversely.\r\nThe males are able to track their desired mates from great distances,\r\nand many remarkable examples of this are known, some of them indeed\r\nsounding almost fabulous. The females must therefore also exhale a\r\nfragrance, and perhaps continually, but it is much more delicate,\r\ncarries extraordinarily far, and is quite imperceptible to our weak\r\nsense of smell. It is possible that it streams out from all the scales\r\ncovering the wings and body, for, as I long ago pointed out, all the\r\nscales retain a connexion with the living cells of the skin, however\r\nminute these may be, and it is therefore quite possible that the cells\r\nproduce scent imperceptible by us, and let it exhale through the\r\nordinary scales, since the male scent-scales owe their ethereal oil to\r\nthe large gland-like cells of the hypodermis on which they are placed.\r\n\r\nHere we see very clearly the difference between ordinary natural\r\nselection and sexual selection. The male odoriferous organs depend on\r\nthe latter, for they do not serve for the maintenance of the species,\r\nbut are of advantage in the courting competitions among the males for\r\nthe possession of the females, while the assumed fragrant cells of the\r\nfemales must depend on natural selection, since they are of general\r\nimportance for the mutual discovery of the sexes, which would otherwise\r\nbe in most cases impossible. This hypothetical 'species scent,' as\r\nwe may call it, is first of all useful in securing the existence of\r\nthe species, and must therefore be referred to natural selection. The\r\nother, the 'male scent,' might be, and actually is, wanting in many\r\nspecies, although it may be necessary to reproduction in cases where it\r\nhas become a male specific character, and could not be absent from any\r\nmale without dooming him to sterility.\r\n\r\nThat the 'species scent' really exists admits of no doubt, although\r\nwe may be unable to perceive it. Entomologists have long been in the\r\nhabit of catching the males of the rarer Lepidoptera, especially of the\r\nnocturnal forms, by freely exposing a captive female. Some years ago\r\nI kept for some time in my study, with a view to certain experiments,\r\nfemales of the eyed hawk-moth (_Smerinthus ocellatus_), and placed them\r\nat first, without any special intention, in a gauze-covered vessel near\r\nthe open window. The very next morning several males had gathered and\r\nwere sitting on the window-sill, or on the wall of the room close to\r\nthe vessel, and by continuing the experiment I caught, in the course\r\nof nine nights, no fewer than forty-two males of this species, which\r\nI had never believed to be so numerous in the gardens of the town. The\r\nmales of the nocturnal Lepidoptera obviously possess an incredibly\r\ndelicate organ of smell, and its bearers, the antennæ, are usually\r\nlarger and more complex in structure in the male sex than in the female.\r\n\r\nButterflies are by no means the only creatures that produce a peculiar\r\nodour at the breeding season; many other animals do the same, though\r\nin their case it does not seem so pleasant to our sense of smell.\r\nIt is true that the scent of the musk-deer and that of the beaver\r\n(_Castoreum_), when much diluted, are agreeable to man, but others,\r\nlike the odours exhaled by stags or by beasts of prey, are very\r\ndisagreeable to us, though they have for the species that produce them\r\nthe same significance as the others, and are therefore to be referred\r\nto sexual selection.\r\n\r\nDarwin referred all the different _mechanisms for the production of\r\nsounds_, up to the song of birds, to sexual selection, but it is\r\nprobable that natural selection has also to do with this in many ways.\r\nIt is certainly only the males which produce the well-known song of the\r\nCicadas, crickets, grasshoppers and birds, and I do not see any reason\r\nto doubt that this 'music' affects the females by arousing sexual\r\nexcitement. To some extent, then, the rivalry among the males for the\r\npossession of the females--that is to say, sexual selection--must have\r\nproduced these mechanisms of song; and how long-continued and gradual\r\nthe accumulations must have been which produced the song of the thrush\r\nor of the nightingale from the chirping of the sparrow we may learn\r\nfrom the innumerable species which, as regards beauty of song, may be\r\nranged between these two extremes.\r\n\r\nMy assumption that natural selection has also been operative in the\r\ncase of the song of insects and birds is based on the fact that many\r\nof our songsters live widely scattered, and that the characteristic\r\nnote must be a means by which the two sexes find each other. That\r\nthey should find each other is an indispensable condition for the\r\nmaintenance of the species. Thus it is well known that each species has\r\na characteristic 'note' or love-call, which the male utters during the\r\nbreeding season, and which is answered by the female. From this simple\r\nlove-call the modern song of many species must have developed by means\r\nof sexual selection.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that here again the various distinguishing characters\r\nof the male seem to be often mutually restrictive or mutually\r\nexclusive. The best singers among our birds are inconspicuously\r\ncoloured, grey or brown-grey, and this can hardly be regarded as due\r\nto chance, but as the outcome of a greater sensitiveness on the part\r\nof the females either to the song or to the beauty of their mates. And\r\nsince, according to the theory, only those characters of the males\r\ncould be increased which decided the choice, it therefore seems to\r\nme that this mutual exclusiveness of the two kinds of distinguishing\r\ncharacters is another indication of the reality of sexual selection.\r\nIt proves--so at least I am inclined to believe--that the excitement\r\nof the female has been essentially affected by _only one_ of the\r\ncharacters of the male, that in the bird of Paradise it was mainly\r\nthe brilliance of the plumage which roused excitement, while in the\r\nnightingale it was mainly the song.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected to this that there are brilliant butterflies which\r\nalso possess scent-scales. This is really the case; thus a magnificent\r\nblue iridescent _Apatura_ from Brazil has on the posterior wings a\r\nlarge yellow brush of scent-hairs, and even the beautiful blue males of\r\nour Lycænids have scent-scales in addition to their beautiful colour.\r\nBut this can hardly be considered as a contradiction, but is rather\r\nan exception, which is the easier to explain since the odoriferous\r\napparatus is a relatively simple arrangement, which did not require\r\nsuch a long series of generations for its evolution as the complicated\r\nsong-box and brain-mechanism of the singing-birds.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it may also be that the scent-scales have arisen later\r\nthan the decorative colouring, and they would do so the more easily\r\nsince the brilliant blue, when once it was perfectly developed, and\r\nwas common to all the males of the species in an equal degree, was\r\nno longer distinctive, and would have no specially exciting effect,\r\nwhile a novel preferential character in the male would have a much\r\nstronger effect. In the same way, the different parts of the body would\r\nbe furnished in succession with decorative and, therefore, exciting\r\ndistinctive characters. To understand this effect on the opposite\r\nsex we need only think of analogous phenomena in human kind, and of\r\nthe strongly exciting effect that the sight of the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of the woman has upon the man.\r\n\r\nBy the successive additions of new decorative characters after the\r\nolder ones became general and reached a climax, the origin of the\r\nextraordinary diversity of the decorative plumage in one and the same\r\nspecies of bird, can be readily understood, and the same is true of\r\nthe complicated decorative coloration of the butterflies in so far as\r\nit depends on sexual selection, and not on other factors. The details\r\ndid not arise all at once, but one after the other, and every character\r\nwent on increasing till it had reached its limit of increase, but\r\nwhenever it was common in its highest development to all the males\r\nit was no longer an object of preference or the cause of specially\r\nviolent excitement, so that a new process of selection would begin in\r\nreference to some other part of the body. We thus understand how, among\r\nmale birds of Paradise and humming-birds, such a marvellous diversity\r\nof colours and of decorative feathers is found combined in one and the\r\nsame species.\r\n\r\nWhoever has seen the Gould Collection of humming-birds in London must\r\nhave observed with amazement that among the 130 or so species of these\r\nbeautiful little birds nearly every group of feathers in the body has\r\nbeen affected by the decorative colouring. In one species the little\r\nfeathers on the region of the throat are emerald green, metallic blue,\r\nor rose; in another the feathers of the neck have been transformed into\r\nan erectile collar of rose-coloured feathers with a metallic sheen; or,\r\nagain, it is the little feathers round the ear that stand erect and are\r\nbrilliantly coloured. Sometimes we find that the feathers of the tail\r\nare lengthened, it may be only two of them, or the various lengths may\r\nbe graduated like steps; sometimes the tail has assumed the form of a\r\nwedge, or is fan-like, or is shaped like the tail of a swallow, and all\r\nthis in combination with the most diverse colours and patterns, black\r\nand white, ultramarine blue, and so forth. Or it may be the outermost\r\ntail-feathers which are the longest, the inner ones the shortest, or\r\nthe four outer feathers are broad, pointed, directed outwards, and only\r\nhalf as long as the other two, which are very long and straight. Some\r\nspecies exhibit a sort of fine swan's down on the legs, others have a\r\ngorgeous metallic red cap on the head--in short, the variety is beyond\r\ndescription, just as we should expect it to be if now this and now that\r\nchance variation attracted the favourable regard of the selecting sex,\r\nand thus attained to its highest pitch of development.\r\n\r\nThe decorative colouring of male birds may be replaced, not only by\r\nthe power of song, but in other ways also. Not all the male birds\r\nof Paradise possess the familiar feather ornaments. The Italian\r\ntraveller Beccari has called attention to a species, the males of\r\nwhich are simply coloured brown, like the females of other species.\r\nThis _Amblyornis inornata_ entices its mate to itself in the pairing\r\ntime in a very peculiar manner, for it arranges in the midst of the\r\nprimitive forests of New Guinea a little 'love garden' or bower, a spot\r\nseveral feet in extent, strewn with white sand, on which it places\r\nshining stones and shells, and brightly coloured berries. In this case\r\na special instinct has developed, which has replaced the personal\r\ncharm of the bird in the eyes of the female. For this very reason the\r\ncase seems to me to have some theoretical importance, for it serves\r\nindirectly to show that the personal excellences do actually function\r\nas a means of exciting and attracting, if any one should still doubt it.\r\n\r\nAll the distinguishing characters of the male which we have hitherto\r\nconsidered have had reference to gaining the favour of the female, but\r\nthere are many other secondary sexual characters which are employed in\r\nquite a different manner to secure possession of the female. I have\r\nalready mentioned that in many butterflies the males possess a much\r\nlarger organ of smell. The antennæ of the males of numerous beetles,\r\nsuch as the cockchafer and its relatives, are also much larger, and\r\nfurnished with much broader accessory branches, than those of the\r\nfemale, and the same is the case in many of the lower crustaceans, like\r\nthe large transparent Daphnid of our lakes, _Leptodora hyalina_. Here\r\nthe anterior antenna bears (Fig. 56, _A_ and _B_, _at´_) olfactory\r\nfilaments; in the female this appendage is small and stump-like, while\r\nin the male (_A_) it grows to a long, somewhat curved rod, which\r\nis extended obliquely into the water, and in addition to the nine\r\nolfactory filaments of the female (_ri_) bears from sixty to ninety\r\nmore (_ri´_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56. _Leptodora hyalina._ _A_, head of the male.\r\n_B_, head of the female. _Au_, eye. _g. opt_, optic ganglion. _gh_,\r\nbrain. _at´_, first antenna with olfactory filaments _ri_ and _ri´_.\r\n_sr_, œsophageal nerve-ring. _n_, nerve. _m_, muscles.]\r\n\r\nIn this and many other such cases it is not the struggle of the\r\nspecies for existence which has so markedly augmented this distinctive\r\ncharacteristic of the male; it is undoubtedly the struggle of the males\r\namong themselves, their competition for the possession of the females.\r\nIn regard to decorative distinctions, the reality of a rivalry in\r\nwooing and the ultimate victory of the most decorative may perhaps be\r\nstill doubted; but it is quite certain that, on an average, the male\r\nwhich can smell and track best will also gain possession of the females\r\nmore easily than one less well equipped. Exactly the same is also true\r\nof those cases in which the male distinguishing character does not\r\nrefer merely to finding the female, but to holding her fast, or, as we\r\nmay say, to capturing her.\r\n\r\nThus the males of the Copepods possess on their anterior antennæ an\r\narrangement which enables them to throw a long whiplike structure\r\nlike a lasso round the head of the female as she rapidly swims away.\r\nThe antennæ of the male Daphnids, too, are in one genus (_Moina_)\r\ndeveloped into a grasping apparatus, instead of into smelling organs as\r\nin _Leptodora_. Fig. 57 shows the male, Fig. 58 the female of _Moina\r\nparadoxa_; the first antennæ of the male are not only much longer and\r\nstronger than those of the female (_at_^1), but they are also armed\r\nwith claws at the end, so that the males can catch their mates as with\r\na fork, and hold them fast. And even that was not enough, for, in\r\naddition, the males of most Daphnids possess a large sickle-shaped but\r\nblunt claw on the first pair of legs (Fig. 57, _fkr_), which enables\r\nthem to cling to the smooth shell of the female, and to clamber up on\r\nit to get into the proper position for copulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57. _Moina paradoxa_, male. _at^1_, first antennæ,\r\nwith claws at the tip for capturing the female. _at^2_, second antennæ.\r\n_fkr_, claws on the first pair of legs for clambering. _gh_, brain.\r\n_lbr_, upper lip. _md_, mandible. _md_, mid-gut, with the liver lobes\r\n(_lh_). _h_, heart. _sp_, testis. _aft_, anus. _sb_, caudal setæ.\r\n_skr_, caudal claws. _sch_, shell. _schr_, cavity of the shell. _kie_,\r\ngill-plates. Magnified 100 times.]\r\n\r\nIf we inquire into the manner of the origin of secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of this kind, we shall find that both may have been\r\nincreased by sexual selection, for a male with a better sickle will\r\nsucceed more quickly in getting into the proper position for copulation\r\nthan one with a less perfect mechanism. This assumption does not rest\r\non mere theory, for I was once able, by a happy chance, to observe for\r\na considerable time, under the microscope, a female to whose shell two\r\nmales were clinging, each trying to push the other off. Nevertheless it\r\nseems to me very questionable whether the origin of this sickle-claw\r\ncan be referred to sexual selection, for without this clamping-organ\r\ncopulation in most Daphnids would not be possible. It was thus not as\r\nan advantage which one male had over another that the clamping-sickle\r\nevolved, but rather as a necessary acquisition of the whole family,\r\nwhich must have developed in all the species at the same time as the\r\nother peculiarities, and notably those of the shell. The competition of\r\nthe males among themselves is thus in this case simply an expression\r\nof the struggle for existence on the part of the species as such, and\r\nit is not a question merely of a character which makes it easier for\r\nthe males to gain possession of the females, but of one which had\r\nnecessarily to arise lest the species should become extinct. In other\r\nwords, in this case natural selection and sexual selection coincide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58. _Moina paradoxa_, female. The letters of Fig.\r\n57 apply _mutatis mutandis_. _brr_, brood-pouch. _ov_, ovary. _sr_,\r\nmargin of shell.]\r\n\r\nThe case of the antennæ of _Moina_, which have been modified into\r\ngrasping organs, is quite different; these owe their origin not to\r\nnatural selection, but to sexual selection, for antennæ of that kind\r\nare not indispensable to the existence of the species, as we can\r\nsee from the closely related genera, _Daphnia_ and _Simocephalus_,\r\nwhere the males have quite short stump-like antennæ, furnished with\r\nolfactory filaments not much more numerous than the females possess.\r\nJust as these supernumerary olfactory filaments were produced by\r\nsexual selection, and not by the ordinary natural selection, because\r\nthose males with the more acute sense of smell had an advantage over\r\nthose in which it was blunter, so the males of the genus _Moina_\r\nwhich could grasp most securely had an advantage over those that\r\ngripped less firmly, and thus arose these two different kinds of male\r\ncharacteristics. Neither of them is of advantage to the species as\r\nsuch, but only to the males in their competition for the possession of\r\nthe females.\r\n\r\nBut, where the production of a novel character in the male is\r\nconcerned, natural selection cannot proceed in a different manner\r\nfrom sexual selection; the process of selection is exactly the same:\r\nthe better equipped males survive, the less well-equipped die without\r\nbegetting offspring; the difference lies only in the fact that in the\r\none case the improvement is in the species as such, in the other case\r\nonly in one sex without the existence of the species being thereby\r\nmade more secure. Such cases are instructive, because they make a\r\ndenial of the process of sexual selection quite impossible if that of\r\nspecies-selection is admitted. If processes of selection are operative\r\nat all as factors in transformation, they must act even where the\r\nadvantage is not to the species but only 'intra-sexual,' and the one\r\nprocess must often run into the other, so that it is often quite\r\nimpossible to draw an exact line of demarcation between them.\r\n\r\nNumerous secondary sexual differences probably depend purely on species\r\nselection, that is to say, they include an improvement of the species\r\nin relation to the struggle for existence. We may find a case in point\r\nin the dwarf-like smallness of the males in many parasitic crustaceans,\r\nin some worms, in many Rotifers, and in the Cirripedes. It can hardly\r\nhave been of advantage for the individual male to be smaller than\r\nhis fellows, but it was of advantage for the species to produce as\r\nmany males as possible in order to ensure a meeting with the females,\r\nand, as the enormous production of males made it advantageous for the\r\nspecies that as little material as possible should be used in their\r\nindividual production, we can readily understand the minuteness of the\r\nmales, and in some cases, as in the Rotifers and _Bonellia_, their\r\npoor equipment, lack of nutritive organs, and ephemeral existence. The\r\nmarine worm, _Bonellia viridis_, whose female may be a foot in length,\r\nis not the only case in which a microscopically small male lives like\r\na parasite inside the female. Among the round-worms, too, there is a\r\nspecies called _Trichosomum crassicauda_, discovered by Leuckart in\r\nthe rat, the dwarf males of which live in the reproductive organs of\r\nthe female. All these are arrangements for securing the propagation of\r\nthe species, which might have been endangered if the males had had to\r\nseek out the females, which, in the case of _Bonellia_, live in holes\r\nin the rocks on the sea-floor, and, in the case of _Trichosomum_, are\r\nconcealed in the urinary bladder of the rat. Obviously, this is the\r\nreason which, in addition to the one already mentioned, has conditioned\r\nand produced, or helped to produce, the remarkable minuteness of\r\ncertain males.\r\n\r\nFrom another category of sexual differences we see in how many ways\r\nspecies-selection and sexual selection play into each other's hands.\r\nIn many species of animals the males are eager for combat, and they\r\nare equipped with special weapons, or excel the females in general\r\nstrength of body. As these males struggle, in the literal sense of the\r\nword, for the possession of the females, Darwin referred to sexual\r\nselection those distinguishing characters which gave the stronger male\r\nthe victory over the weaker, and thus raised the victorious characters\r\nto the rank of general characters of the species. And it certainly\r\ncannot be doubted that, for instance, the strength and the antlers of\r\nthe stag must have been increased through the combats which recurred\r\nevery year at the breeding season, for the stronger always win in these\r\nbattles. The case is the same with the strength and the weapons of many\r\nother male animals. The lion is effectively protected by his mane from\r\nthe bite of a rival, and the same protective arrangement occurs in\r\nquite a different family of mammals--in an eared seal, which is called\r\nthe 'sea-lion' for this very reason. Among the seals the secondary\r\nsexual characters are often very strongly developed, at least in all\r\nthe polygamous species, for in these the struggle for the females is\r\nvery keen. In the 'sea-lions' and 'sea-elephants' there are often fifty\r\nfemales to one male, and the latter are 'enormously larger' than the\r\nfemales, while in monogamous species of seal the two sexes are alike in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nDarwin has shown that actual combat for the females takes place among\r\nmost mammals, not only among stags, lions, and seals, but even among\r\nthe moles and the timid hares. Even among birds such combats occur, and\r\nthis is sometimes particularly noteworthy in those species in which the\r\nmales possess the most decorative colouring, like the humming-birds. In\r\nsome cases among birds there has also been a development of weapons.\r\nWitness the spur of the cock, whose merciless combats with his rivals\r\nMan has, as is well known, made positively atrocious for his own\r\namusement, by preventing the flight of the vanquished.\r\n\r\nIn Darwin's great work on sexual selection a considerable number of\r\ncases are cited from among lower vertebrates, such as crocodiles\r\nand fishes, and even from insects, in which the males fight for\r\nthe possession of the females, and exhibit distinctive masculine\r\ncharacters adapted to such combats. But I do not propose to enter upon\r\na discussion of such cases, since my aim is rather to elucidate the\r\nrelation between sexual selection and species-selection than to discuss\r\nall the phenomena of the former in detail. But the combats of males\r\nillustrate with particular clearness the relation of sexual selection\r\nand species-selection, since many of the weapons or protective\r\narrangements which may have arisen through sexual selection imply at\r\nthe same time an improvement to the species in relation to the struggle\r\nfor existence. Thus greater strength or sharper and larger teeth in the\r\nmales mean a gain to the species, and it is indifferent to the species\r\nwhether the weaker males succumb to a strange enemy (species-selection)\r\nor to their stronger rivals (sexual selection), provided only that the\r\nbetter equipped survive and leave descendants similarly endowed.\r\n\r\nI have intentionally begun the consideration of sexual selection with\r\nthe cases most difficult to interpret on this theory, with those which\r\nhave called forth the greatest divergence of opinion--the decorative\r\ncolours and forms, the song of birds and of insects, the alluring\r\nodours--in short, all the courtship-adaptations of the males; these are\r\nthe most difficult to deal with, because it is not easy to demonstrate\r\ndirectly that the females _do_ choose. But if we revise them briefly\r\nin reverse order, I believe that all doubt as to the reality of choice\r\non the part of the females will disappear. Thus the last-mentioned\r\nsexual characters of greater strength and greater perfection of weapons\r\nand defence in the males have been evolved by sexual selection in\r\nclose co-operation with species-selection. We should have to deny\r\nspecies-selection altogether if we were to dispute this form of sexual\r\nselection, which is closely connected with pure species-selection,\r\nsuch, for instance, as is revealed in the production of dwarf males,\r\nwhere there does not seem to be any aid from sexual selection at all.\r\n\r\nThen came the cases in which the tracking and grasping organs of the\r\nmales were strengthened or were increased in number, and here too\r\nspecies-selection may have had its share, for instance, in evolving\r\nthe sickle-claws of the Daphnids, which were inevitably advanced and\r\nperfected through sexual selection, which must in this case have\r\noperated independently of any choice on the part of the female. In\r\nother cases the result may be referred to pure sexual selection,\r\nas in the grasping antennæ of the male _Moina_, or in the highly\r\ndeveloped olfactory antennæ of the male _Leptodora_. That new organs,\r\ntoo, can arise in this way is shown by the 'turban eyes'--to which\r\nlittle attention has hitherto been paid--of some Ephemerids of the\r\ngenera _Cloë_ and _Potamanthus_, which were long ago described by\r\nPictet, the monographer of this family. These are large turban-shaped\r\ncompound eyes, occurring beside the ordinary eyes in the males alone,\r\nwhich in these genera are in a majority of sixty to one. Whole swarms\r\nof these males fly about over the water on the search for females,\r\nand their highly developed organ of vision seems to decide matters\r\nfor them just as the organ of smell does for _Leptodora_. Neither of\r\nthese sense-organs can have any other advantage than that of making\r\ntheir possessors aware of the female, for the whole activity of the\r\nshort-lived adult Ephemerides is limited to reproduction; they take no\r\nfood, and have nothing whatever to do except to reproduce.\r\n\r\nFinally, when in an enormous number of cases we find in addition to one\r\nor the other of the already mentioned male distinguishing characters\r\nsome which do not directly lead to gaining possession of the female,\r\nbut do so only by sexually exciting her, can we doubt that the same\r\nprinciple has been operative, that here too processes of selection\r\nare fundamental, depending on the fact that in the wooing of the\r\nfemale the successful male is the one who most strongly excites her?\r\nThere is no question of æsthetic pleasure in this, as the opponents\r\nof the theory of sexual selection have often urged, but only of\r\nsexual excitement, which may be aroused by very different means, by\r\ncolours and shapes, but also by love-calls, songs, or odours. There\r\nare a few tropical birds (_Chasmorhynchus_) which have as the only\r\ndistinguishing character of the male sex a hollow and soft appendage\r\nseveral inches long borne on the head. Usually it hangs down limply at\r\nthe side of the head, but during the breeding season it is inflated\r\nfrom the mouth-cavity, and then stands erect like a spur. One species\r\nof this genus has as many as three of these horns, one of which is\r\nupright, while the other two stand out laterally from the head. Can it\r\nbe supposed that these remarkable horns satisfy the female's 'sense\r\nof beauty'? To human beings they appear rather ugly than beautiful,\r\nboth when limp and when inflated, but at any rate they are striking,\r\nand will be regarded by the female bird as something out of the\r\ncommon, and, since they are only fully displayed during the breeding\r\nseason, that is, when the male is sexually excited, they will have an\r\nexciting effect on the female too. These inflated horns are symptoms\r\nof excitement, and they arouse it in the female. In exactly the same\r\nway the decorative feathers, the ruby-red and emerald-green feather\r\ncollars of the humming-birds and birds of Paradise, are only erected\r\nand displayed when the males are wooing, and they, too, act as signs\r\nof excitement. This is not to say that the gorgeousness of colour,\r\nthe eye-spots on the train of the peacock and the Argus pheasant, and\r\nthe hundreds of different kinds of beautiful feathers, do not also\r\nexercise a fascinating influence; on the contrary, we cannot avoid\r\nassuming this, since otherwise we could find no sufficient reason for\r\ntheir origin. But the primary effect in wooing is not due to the mere\r\npleasure in the sight, or in the odour, or in the song, but to the\r\ncontagious excitement which these express. The females do not behave as\r\ndispassionate judges, but as excitable persons which fall to the lot of\r\nthe male who is able to excite them most strongly. It may be, however,\r\nthat a sense of æsthetic satisfaction in perceiving such symptoms of\r\nexcitement may also have been evolved as an accessory effect, at least\r\nin the higher and more intelligent animals.\r\n\r\nIn the lower animals, which are lacking not only in intelligence but\r\nalso in the higher and more complex differentiation of the sensory\r\nsystem, the development of such secondary sex characters is rare or\r\naltogether absent. Animals which have no sense of hearing can develop\r\nno song, and animals which do not see cannot acquire gorgeous colours\r\nas a means of exciting one sex through the other. But distinctive sex\r\ncoloration may arise even in lowly animals, though there can be no\r\nquestion of æsthetic pleasure associated therewith; if the animals are\r\nable to see the colours at all, sexual excitement may be associated\r\nwith these.\r\n\r\nWe need not wonder, therefore, that in the somewhat stupid fishes, in\r\nthe butterflies, and in the lower crustaceans, like the Daphnids, we\r\nstill find brilliant colours, which we can hardly interpret otherwise\r\nthan as the results of sexual selection. On the other hand, the absence\r\nof such characters in animals of a still lower order, with still\r\nsimpler sense-organs, like the Polyps, Medusæ, Echinoderms, most Worms,\r\nand the Sponges, affords an indirect confirmation of the correctness\r\nof our view as to the reality of a sexual selection in the more highly\r\norganized animals.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that numerous peculiarities which distinguish the\r\nmales of a species from the females depend on the process of sexual\r\nselection. This may be said of ornamental outgrowths, colours,\r\nremarkable feathers and feather-groups, peculiar odoriferous organs,\r\nvocal organs, artistic instincts, and also weapons, like antlers,\r\ntusks, and spurs, notable size and strength of body, and protective\r\ndevices like manes; and again, the various organs for catching and\r\nholding the females, or for finding them out by sight or smell, must\r\nalso be referred, at least in part, to sexual selection. The diversity\r\nof the male sexual characters is so great that I cannot give more than\r\na faint idea of them without entering on a long catalogue; whoever\r\nwishes a complete survey has only to consult Darwin's _Descent of Man_.\r\n\r\nBut the significance of sexual selection is by no means exhausted with\r\nthe production of the male sexual characters, for these characters are\r\noften more or less completely transferred to the females, and thus give\r\nrise to a transformation of the whole species, and not only of the male\r\nsection of it. This is obviously a very important consequence of sexual\r\nselection, one which, as we shall see, materially deepens our insight\r\ninto the mode of origin of new species.\r\n\r\nFirst let us try to determine the facts. Many male characters are not\r\nrepresented in the female in any degree, and therefore have never\r\nbeen transmitted to them at all. Such are the mane of the lion, the\r\ngrasping antennæ of _Moina_, the turban eyes of the Ephemerides, the\r\nintensification of the sense of smell in _Leptodora_, the lasso-like\r\nantennæ of the Copepods, the scent-scales of the butterflies, and the\r\nmusk glands of the alligators and stags. But in other cases there has\r\nbeen transmission, though only to a slight extent. Thus many female\r\nhumming-birds have a faint indication of the magnificent metallic\r\ncolouring of the males; many female blue butterflies have a tinge of\r\nthe beautiful blue of their mates; the females of the stag-beetle\r\n(_Lucanus cervus_) possess a diminutive suggestion of the antler-like\r\njaws of the male, and the female crickets, although they do not chirp,\r\nhave a slight indication of the 'musical' mechanism of the male on the\r\nwing-coverts, and some of them even produce feeble notes at certain\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIt can be proved, however, that such transmissions may, in the\r\ncourse of many successive generations, become intensified until the\r\ncharacters are exhibited by the females in the same degree as in the\r\nmales. I know no better example of this than that afforded by the\r\nbeautiful butterflies of the genus _Lycæna_. In this genus, which is\r\nrich in species and widely distributed over the whole earth, and must\r\ntherefore be an old one, the upper surface of the wing is blue in by\r\nfar the greater number of species, at least in the male sex. But there\r\nare three or four species which are dark-brown, and quite or nearly\r\nalike in the two sexes; such are the species _Lycæna agestis_, _L.\r\neumedon_, _L. admetus_, and others. Everything indicates that this is\r\nthe primitive colour of the genus. Moreover, there are some species\r\nwith brown females, in which the males are not completely blue, but\r\nwhich have a slight bluish tinge, like _L. alsus_, the smallest of\r\nour indigenous Blues. Then follows a host of beautiful species, like\r\n_L. alexis_, _L. adonis_, _L. damon_, _L. corydon_, and many others,\r\nwith brown females, and among these there occasionally occur females\r\nmore or less tinged with blue. These lead on to _L. meleager_, which\r\nhas two forms of female, a common brown and a rarer blue; and thus\r\nwe reach _L. tiresias_, _L. optilete_, and _L. argiolus_, in which\r\nall the females are blue, although less intensely and completely so\r\nthan their mates. The climax of this evolutionary series is reached\r\nby some species like _L. beatica_, belonging to tropical or at least\r\nwarm countries, in which both sexes are of an equally intense blue. As\r\nwe know that, in species with an excess of males, sexual characters\r\nalways begin in the males, there can be no doubt as to the direction\r\nof evolution--from brown to blue--in this series. Furthermore, the\r\nentire absence of scent-scales in most of the species with brown males\r\nindicates the great age of these species, for, as far as I have been\r\nable to investigate, all the males of the blue species possess them.\r\n\r\nDarwin regarded this transferring of the male characters to the females\r\nas due to inheritance, and it really seems as if it were simply a case\r\nof transmission by inheritance to one sex of what has been acquired\r\nby the other. Yet we have to ask whether we can continue to regard\r\nthe facts in this light. In any case this 'transmission' is not an\r\ninevitable physiological process, necessarily resulting from the\r\nintrinsic conditions of inheritance, for we see that it often does\r\nnot occur, even in many cases in which we can see no external reasons\r\nwhy it should not do so, though in other cases the failure may be\r\npresumably correlated with the external conditions of life. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the persistent retention of the brown colour in the majority\r\nof our female Lycænidæ has probably its reason in the greater need\r\nof protection on the part of the much rarer females, and this must\r\nbe so also in the case of many birds in which the brilliant colours\r\nof the males have not been transferred to the females. Wallace first\r\npointed out that all birds whose females brood in exposed nests are\r\ninconspicuously coloured in the female sex, even if the males are\r\nbrightly coloured, while those whose nests are concealed in holes of\r\ntrees or the like, or which build domes over them, not rarely exhibit\r\nbrilliant colouring in both sexes. This is the case in woodpeckers and\r\nparrots, while the gallinaceous birds, which brood in the open, have\r\nusually inconspicuously coloured females, for the most part very well\r\nadapted to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nIf we grasp the fact that a transference of the characters which have\r\narisen through sexual selection can take place, we have a valuable\r\naid in the interpretation of many phenomena which would otherwise\r\nremain quite inexplicable. What is the meaning of the gay colours of\r\nthe parrots, which occur in such incredibly diverse combinations\r\nin this large and widely distributed family? Or of the marvellously\r\ncomplex markings and colour-patterns of the butterflies? In some cases\r\nthey may be protective, as is the green of many parrots; in others,\r\nwarning signs of unpalatability, like the bright colours and contrasted\r\nmarkings of many Heliconiidæ and Eusemiidæ and other butterflies with\r\na nauseous taste; but there remain a great many cases to which neither\r\nof these explanations applies, which could only be regarded as pure\r\nfreaks of nature if we did not know that male sexual characters can\r\nbe transferred to the females, and that thus all the individuals of a\r\nspecies can be totally altered in their colouring.\r\n\r\nThus the occurrence not only of conspicuous, but of complicated,\r\ncoloration is explained.\r\n\r\nDarwin has shown that, in the equipment developed by the males in their\r\ncompetition for the possession of the females, it is by no means only\r\nthose characters which may be considered 'beautiful' in themselves that\r\nhave to be considered; it is rather the striking characteristics which\r\nmark their possessor and distinguish it from others that are primarily\r\nimportant. In fact, it is the principle of 'mode' or 'fashion' which is\r\noperative; something new is demanded, and as far as possible something\r\nquite different from that which was previously considered beautiful.\r\nThus the starting-point for such processes of selection may have been\r\nafforded by white spots on a black ground, or, indeed, by any light\r\nspots on a dark ground, which may have been the primitive colour in\r\nmost cases. If in the course of a long series of generations these\r\nspots became the common property of all the males, a possibility of\r\nfurther change was opened up as soon as a new contrast cropped up as\r\na chance variation, which would then, under favourable conditions, be\r\nthe starting-point of a new process of selection. Darwin has cited\r\nsome cases in which, from a comparison of the dress of the young bird\r\nwith that of the adult, we may conclude that a transformation of the\r\ncolouring of the whole plumage must have taken place in the course of\r\nthe phylogenetic history.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the course of the process of selection has been such\r\nthat, though the general colouring has not been changed, variations\r\nhave appeared in particular regions of the body--spots or stripes which\r\naccumulated through the ages and co-operated to form an increasingly\r\ndiverse and complex colour-scheme, such a 'marking' of the animal as we\r\nmay observe to-day, especially in butterflies, but also in birds.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine corroboration of the origin of bright colours through\r\nsexual selection that, even in those groups of the animal kingdom which\r\nare in general sexually monomorphic, there always occur some species\r\nin which male and female are quite different, and a host of species in\r\nwhich both sexes are alike in the main, yet with differences in certain\r\nminor points. Among the parrots similarity of colouring prevails as\r\na general rule, but in New Guinea there lives a parrot the female of\r\nwhich is a gorgeous blood-red and the male a beautiful light-green;\r\nminor differences occur in many species, for instance, the female\r\nof the horned parrot (_Cyanorhamphus cornutus_ Gm.) lacks the two\r\nlong black and red feathers on the head, that of the grass-parakeet\r\n(_Melopsittacus undulatus_) is a slightly paler green and has not\r\nthe beautiful blue spots on the cheeks which the male possesses.\r\nInnumerable similar instances might be cited, serving to show that all\r\nthese distinguishing characters of the males have been acquired step by\r\nstep and piece by piece, and are slowly and independently transferred\r\nto the females--if, indeed, at all.\r\n\r\nIn yet another way the correctness of the Darwinian theory of sexual\r\nselection may be deduced from the markings and coloration of birds and\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently struck me, during the long period in which I have\r\nbeen studying brightly coloured birds and butterflies, that those\r\ncolour-patterns which are referable to sexual selection are much\r\nsimpler than those which must be referred to species-selection,\r\nespecially in the case of what we call 'sympathetic coloration.' How\r\ncrude is the decorative pattern of most parrots, notwithstanding all\r\nthe brilliance of their colour. Large tracts of the body are red,\r\nothers green, yellow, blue, and occasionally one finds a red and\r\nblue striped feather collar, a head which is red above and yellow\r\nunderneath, but it is seldom that the colours vary enough in a small\r\nspace to give rise to a delicate decorative pattern. The gayest of\r\nparrots are the Brush Tongues (_Trichoglossus_), and even among them\r\nsubtlety of coloration does not go further than the combination of\r\nthree colours on one of the long tail-feathers, or the production of\r\na double band round the neck, and so forth. If we compare with this\r\nthe complex markings of the inconspicuously coloured females of the\r\npheasants, of the partridges, or that of the upper surface of the\r\nmany birds in mingled grey, blackish-brown and white, which resemble\r\nthe ground or the dried leaves when they crouch, we find that the\r\ncolour-pattern in these cases is infinitely finer and more complex.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me quite intelligible when we remember, on the one hand,\r\nthat species-selection must operate far more intensively than sexual\r\nselection, and that in the production of a protective colouring it is\r\na question of deceiving the eye of a sharp-sighted enemy, while the\r\naim of sexual selection is to secure the approval of others of the\r\nsame species. As long as the enemy on the search for prey perceives\r\nthe difference between the markings of its victim and those of the\r\nsurroundings, so long will the gradual and steady improvement of the\r\nprotective coloration continue, so long will new shades and new lines\r\nbe added. We can thus understand how there would be gradually reached\r\na complexity of marking to which sexual selection can never attain,\r\nor at least only in regard to a few specially favourable points.\r\nThe eye-spots on the train feathers of the Argus pheasant and the\r\npeacock are such points, and these occur among polygamous birds in\r\nwhich sexual selection must be very intense; they are placed, too,\r\non a part of the body, the wheel-shaped train, which is peculiarly\r\nsuited for communicating the excitement of the male to the female, and\r\nmust therefore be especially influenced by the latter. In general,\r\nhowever, we may say on _a priori_ grounds that the intensity of\r\nspecies-selection is greater than that of sexual selection, because the\r\nformer ceaselessly and pitilessly eliminates the less perfect, while\r\nthe claims of the latter are in any case less imperative, and are also\r\noften mollified by a variety of chance circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of insects, in particular, we have to add that the\r\nprotective colours and the decorative colours have been, so to speak,\r\npainted by different artists--the former by birds, lizards, and other\r\npersecutors endowed with well-developed eyes, the latter by the insects\r\nthemselves, whose eyes can hardly possess, for objects not quite near,\r\nthat acuteness of vision which the bird's eye has. Thus we find that\r\nthe protective coloration of butterflies has often a very complex\r\nmarking, while the same butterfly may exhibit only a rather crude\r\nthough brilliant pattern on its upper surface, where the coloration is\r\ndue to sexual selection. Thus the famous _Kallima_ has on its under\r\nsurface the likeness of a dry or decayed leaf composed of a number\r\nof colour-tones--quite a complex painting. But if we look at the\r\nupper surface we see a deep brown with a shimmer of steel blue as the\r\nground-colour of the wings, and on it a broad yellow band and a white\r\nspot: that is the whole pattern. We find a similar state of things\r\namong many of the forest butterflies of Brazil, and also among our\r\nindigenous butterflies. The pattern of our gayest diurnal butterflies,\r\nthe red Admiral and the tortoiseshell butterfly (_Vanessa atalanta_ and\r\n_Vanessa cardui_), is somewhat crude on the upper surface, and very\r\nsimple compared with the protective colouring of the under surface,\r\nwhich is made up of hundreds of points, spots, strokes, and lines of\r\nevery shape and colour. On the other hand, the upper surface of the\r\nanterior wings in the hawk-moths and the Noctuidæ exhibits protective\r\ncoloration, and is made up of curious zigzag complex lines, strokes,\r\nand spots, so that it resembles the bark of a tree or a bit of an old\r\nwooden fence--a painting, like the modern impressionist work, which,\r\nwith an apparently meaningless confusion of colour splashes, conveys a\r\nperfect impression even of the details of a landscape. In the owl-moths\r\n(Noctuidæ) the wing surfaces, which are brightly coloured, are simple,\r\nalmost crude, in pattern, as in the moths of the genus _Catocala_, with\r\ntheir red, blue, or yellow posterior wings, traversed by a large black\r\nband; while in the Geometer-moths, whose wings are spread out flat when\r\nat rest, the protective upper surface of all four wings is covered\r\nwith a complex pattern of lines, spots, and streaks in different\r\nshades of grey, yellow, white, and black, so that it bears a deceptive\r\nresemblance to the bark of a tree or the side of a wall. For a long\r\ntime I could not understand how such a definite and constant pattern\r\ncould arise through natural selection if it was a case of mimicking the\r\nimpression of bark or of any other irregularly covered surface, the\r\ncolours of which are not mingled in exactly the same way everywhere.\r\nBut now I think I understand it; for in the apparently meaningless\r\ncolour-splashes of an 'impressionist' landscape the different splashes\r\nmust be exactly where they are, otherwise on stepping back from the\r\npicture one would see, not a Haarlem hyacinth-field, or an avenue of\r\npoplars with their golden autumn leaves, but a mere unintelligible\r\ndaub. It is the _type_ of the colour-pattern that must be attained,\r\nand in nature this is attained very slowly, step by step, spot after\r\nspot, and therefore, obviously, no correct stroke once attained will\r\nbe given up again, since, in combination with the rest, it secures\r\nthe proper type of colour-pattern. Only thus, it seems to me, can we\r\nunderstand how apparently meaningless lines, like the figures 1840 on\r\nthe under surface of _Vanessa atalanta_, could have become a constant\r\ncharacteristic of the species.\r\n\r\nTo sum up briefly, we may say that sexual selection is a much more\r\npowerful factor in transformation than we should at first be inclined\r\nto believe. It cannot, of course, have been operative in the case of\r\nplants, nor can it be taken into consideration in regard to the lower\r\nanimals, for these, like the plants, do not pair, or, at any rate,\r\ndo so without any possibility of choice. Animals which live on the\r\nsea-floor, or which are attached there, must simply liberate their\r\nreproductive cells into the water, and cannot secure that they unite\r\nwith those of this or that individual. This is the case among sponges,\r\ncorals, and Hydroid polyps. In some other classes the sense organs are\r\ntoo poorly developed, and the eyes in particular too imperfect to be\r\nexcited in different degrees by any peculiarities in the appearance\r\nor behaviour of the males. This is what Darwin meant when he ascribed\r\nto these animals 'too imperfect senses and much too low intelligence'\r\n'to estimate the beauty or other attractive points of the opposite\r\nsex, or to feel anything like rivalry.' Accordingly, in the Protozoa,\r\nEchinoderms, Medusæ, and Ctenophores, secondary sexual characters are\r\nentirely absent, as pairing also is.\r\n\r\nIn those worms that pair we first meet with secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, and from this level upwards they are never quite absent\r\nfrom any large group, and gradually play an increasingly important rôle.\r\n\r\nBut the significance of sexual selection lies, as we have seen,\r\nnot only in the fact that one sex of a species, usually the male,\r\nis modified, but in the possibility of the transference of this\r\nmodification to the females, and further, in the fact that the process\r\nof variation may start afresh at any time, and thus one variation may\r\nbe developed upon or alongside of another. In this way we can explain\r\ncertain complex and often fantastic forms and colourings which we could\r\nnot otherwise understand; thus the extraordinary number of nearly\r\nrelated species in some animal groups, such as butterflies and birds,\r\nin which the differences mainly concern the colour-patterns.\r\n\r\nDarwin has shown convincingly that a surprising number of characters\r\nin animals, from worms upwards, have their roots in sexual selection,\r\nand has pointed out the probability that this process has played an\r\nimportant part in the evolution of the human race also, though, in this\r\ncase, all is not yet so clearly and certainly known as among animals.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this section, I should like once again to call attention\r\nto the deficiency which is necessarily involved in the assumption\r\nof any selection, sexual selection included, namely, that the first\r\nbeginning of the character which has been intensified by selection\r\nremains obscure. Darwin attached importance to the occurrence of\r\nordinary individual variation, but it is open to question whether the\r\ninsignificant variations thus produced could give an adequate advantage\r\nin the competition for the possession of the females; and, further,\r\nwhether we have not grounds for the assumption that larger variations\r\nalso occur. This question may also be asked in regard to ordinary\r\nnatural selection, although in that case we can imagine the beginnings\r\nto be smaller, since here the advantage of a variation lies only in\r\nthe fact that it is useful, not in its being appreciated by others.\r\nAs a matter of fact, this very difficulty as to the first beginnings\r\nof variations has been frequently urged against both hypotheses of\r\nselection, and rightly so, inasmuch as this must be above all else\r\nthe point of attack for further investigations. But it is a mistake\r\nto deny the whole processes of selection simply because this point is\r\nnot yet clear. Later on we shall attempt to gain some insight into\r\nthe causes of variation, and then we shall return to this question\r\nof the beginnings of the selective processes. In the meantime let it\r\nsuffice to say that Darwin was very well aware that, in addition to the\r\nordinary individual variations, there were also larger deviations which\r\noccurred discontinuously in single forms. He believed, however, that\r\nsuch occurrences were very rare, and, on the whole, he was not inclined\r\nto ascribe to them any particular importance in the transformation of\r\nspecies. He rather referred the organic transformations which have\r\ntaken place in the course of the earth's history, in the main, to the\r\nintensification of the ordinary individual variations, and I believe\r\nthat he was right in so doing, since adaptations from their very nature\r\ncannot have been brought about by sudden chance leaps in organization,\r\nbut can only have become exactly suited to chance conditions of life\r\nthrough a gradual accumulation of minute variations in the direction\r\nof utility. Whether, however, purely sexual distinctions may not have\r\nhad their primary roots in discontinuous variations must be inquired\r\ninto later. Theoretically, there is nothing against this assumption,\r\nwhen such characters are not adaptations like the lasso antennæ of\r\nthe Copepods, or the turban eyes of the Ephemerids; mere distinctive\r\nmarkings, decorative coloration, peculiar outgrowths, and the like,\r\nmay, if they arose discontinuously, very well have formed the basis for\r\nfurther sexual selection, as long as they were not prejudicial to the\r\nexistence of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XII\r\n\r\nINTRA-SELECTION OR SELECTION AMONG TISSUES\r\n\r\n Does the Lamarckian principle really play a part in the\r\n transformations of species?--Darwin's position in regard to this\r\n question--Doubts expressed by Galton and others--Neo-Lamarckians\r\n and Neo-Darwinians--Results of exercise and practice: functional\r\n adaptation--Wilhelm Roux, _Kampf der Theile_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have devoted a whole series of lectures to studying the\r\nDarwin-Wallace principle of Natural Selection and the range of its\r\noperation. It seemed to us to make innumerable adaptations intelligible\r\nup to a certain point. We now understand how the purposefulness, which\r\nwe meet with everywhere among organisms, can have arisen without\r\nthe direct interference of a Power working intentionally towards an\r\nend--simply as the outcome and result of the survival of the fittest.\r\nThe two forms of the processes of selection, 'natural selection' in\r\nthe narrower sense, and 'sexual selection,' dominate, so to speak, all\r\nparts and all functions of the organism, and are striving to adapt\r\nthese as well as possible to the conditions of their life. And although\r\nthe range of operation of Natural Selection is incomparably greater,\r\nbecause it actually affects every part, yet we must attribute to sexual\r\nselection also, at least among animals, a range of influence by no\r\nmeans unimportant, since through it, as far as we can see at present,\r\nnot only do the secondary sexual characters in all their diversity\r\narise, but by the transference of these to the other sex that too is\r\nmodified, and thus the whole species may be influenced, and may indeed\r\nbe started afresh on an unlimited series of further transformations.\r\n\r\nBut although the processes of selection play such an important part in\r\nthe transformations of the forms of life, we have to inquire whether\r\nthey are the _sole_ factors in these transformations, whether the\r\naccumulation of chance variations in the direction of utility has been\r\nthe sole factor in bringing about the evolution of the animate world,\r\nor whether other factors have not also co-operated with it.\r\n\r\nWe are all aware that Lamarck regarded the direct influence of use\r\nand disuse as the most essential factor in transformation, and that\r\nDarwin, though hesitatingly and cautiously, recognized and accepted\r\nthis factor, which he believed to be indispensable. Indeed, it seems\r\nat first sight to be so. There is a whole range of facts which seem to\r\nbe intelligible only in terms of the Lamarckian theory; in particular,\r\nthe existence of numberless vestigial or rudimentary organs which\r\nhave degenerated through disuse, the remains of eyes in animals which\r\nlive in darkness, of wings in running birds, of hind legs in swimming\r\nmammals (whales), and of ear muscles in Man, who no longer points his\r\nears, and so forth through a long list.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wiedersheim, there are in Man alone about two hundred of\r\nthese vestigial or rudimentary organs, and there is no higher animal\r\nwhich does not possess some. In all, therefore, a piece of the past\r\nhistory of the species is embodied in the actually existing organism,\r\nand bears witness to the fact that much of what the ancestors possessed\r\nis now superfluous, and is either transformed, or is gradually set\r\naside, or is still in process of being set aside. It seems obvious that\r\nthis gradual dwindling and degeneration of an organ no longer needed\r\ncannot be explained through natural selection in the Darwin-Wallace\r\nsense, for the process goes on so exceedingly slowly that the minute\r\ndifferences in the size of an organ, which may occur among individuals\r\nof the species at any given time during the retrogressive process,\r\ncannot possibly have a selection value. Whether the degenerate and\r\nnow functionless hind leg of the whale is a little larger or a little\r\nsmaller can have no importance in the struggle for existence; the\r\nsmaller organ cannot be considered either as a lesser hindrance in\r\nswimming or as a greater economy of material, and the case is the same\r\nin regard to most other instances of degeneration through disuse. We\r\ntherefore require another interpretation, and at first sight this seems\r\nto be supplied by the Lamarckian principle.\r\n\r\nBut the reverse process, the strengthening, the enlarging, and the more\r\nperfect development of a part, very often goes on proportionately to\r\nits more frequent use, and here again the Lamarckian principle seems to\r\nafford a simple explanation. For we know that exercise strengthens a\r\npart, as disuse weakens it, and if we could assume that these results\r\nof use and disuse were transmitted from the individual who brought them\r\nabout or 'acquired' them in the course of his life to his offspring,\r\nthen there would be nothing to object to in the Lamarckian principle.\r\nBut it is precisely here that the difficulty lies. Can we assume such\r\na transmission of 'acquired' characters? Does it exist? Can it be\r\ndemonstrated?\r\n\r\nThat Lamarck did not even put this question to himself, but assumed\r\nsuch transmission as a matter of course, is readily intelligible\r\nwhen we consider the time at which he lived. He was himself one of\r\nthe first to grasp the idea of the transmutation-hypothesis, and he\r\nwas only too glad to have any sort of principle of interpretation\r\nready to work with. But Charles Darwin, too, attributed a not\r\ninconsiderable influence to this principle, although the transmission\r\nof 'acquired' characters which it took for granted was not accepted\r\nwithout reflective hesitation. He even directed his own particular\r\ntheory of heredity, as we shall see, especially to the explanation of\r\nthis supposed form of inheritance, and we can very well understand\r\nthis, after what I have said as to the impossibility of explaining\r\nthe disappearance of organs which have become superfluous by the\r\nDarwin-Wallace theory of Natural Selection. Darwin needed the\r\nLamarckian principle for the explanation of these phenomena, and it\r\nwas this that decided him to assume the transmission of 'acquired'\r\ncharacters, although the proofs of it can hardly have satisfied him.\r\nFor when we are confronted with facts which we see no possibility\r\nof understanding save on a single hypothesis, even though it be an\r\nundemonstrable one, we are naturally led to accept the hypothesis, at\r\nleast until a better one can be found. It is in this way, obviously,\r\nthat we are to understand Darwin's attitude to the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple; he did not reject it, because it seemed to him to offer the\r\nonly possible explanation of the disappearance of characters which have\r\nbecome useless; he adhered to it, although the transmission of acquired\r\ncharacters which it assumed must have seemed, and, in point of fact,\r\ndid seem to him doubtful, or at least not definitely proved. Doubts,\r\nsome faint, some stronger, as to this assumed form of inheritance were\r\nhardly expressed till somewhat late in the day--almost twenty years\r\nafter the appearance of the _Origin of Species_--first by Francis\r\nGalton (1875), then by His, who definitely declared himself at least\r\nagainst any inheritance of mutilations, and by Du Bois-Reymond, who,\r\nin his address _Ueber die Uebung_ in 1881, said: 'If we are to be\r\nhonest, we must admit that the inheritance of acquired characters is a\r\nhypothesis inferred solely from the facts which have to be explained,\r\nand that it is in itself quite obscure.'\r\n\r\nThis is how it must appear to every one who examines it simply in\r\nrespect of its theoretical possibility, its conceivability. This is how\r\nit appeared to me when I attempted, in 1883, to arrive at clearness on\r\nthe subject, and I then expressed my conviction that such a form of\r\ninheritance was not only unproved, but that it was even theoretically\r\nunthinkable, and that we ought to try to explain the fact of the\r\ndisappearance of disused parts in some other way, and I attempted to\r\ngive an explanation, as will be seen later.\r\n\r\nThus war was declared against the Lamarckian principle of the direct\r\neffect of use and disuse, and there arose a strife which has continued\r\ndown to the present day, the strife between the Neo-Lamarckians and the\r\nNeo-Darwinians, as the two disputing parties have been called.\r\n\r\nIn order to form an independent opinion in regard to this famous\r\ndispute, it is, first of all, necessary to examine what actually takes\r\nplace when an organ is exercised or is left inactive, and further,\r\nwhether we can assume that the results of this exercise or inaction can\r\nbe transmitted to descendants.\r\n\r\nThat exercise in general has a strengthening, and neglect of it a\r\nweakening influence on the relevant organ has long been known and is\r\nfamiliar to all; gymnastics make the muscles stronger, the thickness of\r\nthe exercised muscle and the number of its fibres increases; the right\r\narm, which is much more used than the left, is capable of performing\r\ntwenty per cent. more work. Similarly, the activity of glands is\r\nincreased by exercise, and the glands themselves are increased in\r\nsize, as are the milk-glands of the cow through frequent milking; and\r\nthat even the nerve-elements can be favourably influenced by exercise\r\nis proved by actors and professors of mnemonics, who have by practice\r\nincreased their powers of memory to an almost incredible degree. I have\r\nheard of a singer who had learned by heart 160 operas; and which of us\r\nhas not experienced how quickly the capacity for learning by rote can\r\nbe again increased by practice, even after it has been neglected or\r\nleft unexercised for a long time?\r\n\r\nI have always been particularly struck with the practising of a piece\r\nof music, with its long succession of periods of different phrase,\r\nwith its changes in melody, rhythm, and harmony, which nevertheless\r\nbecomes so firmly stamped on the memory that it can be played, not\r\nonly consciously, but quite unconsciously, when the player is thinking\r\nintensely of other things. It is in this case not the memory alone, but\r\nthe whole complicated mechanism of successive muscle-impulses, with\r\nall the details of fast and slow, loud and soft, that is engraved on\r\nthe brain elements, just like a long series of reflex movements which\r\nset one another a-going. Though in this case we cannot demonstrate\r\nthe material changes which have taken place in the nervous elements,\r\nthere can be no doubt that changes have taken place, and that these\r\nconsist in a strengthening of definite elements and parts of elements.\r\nThe strengthening causes certain ganglion-cells to give a stronger\r\nimpulse in a particular direction, and this impulse acquires increasing\r\ntransmissive power, and so on.\r\n\r\nOur first theoretical insight into these relations came through Wilhelm\r\nRoux, who, in 1881, gave expression to what had previously been\r\nan open, if not quite conscious, secret, that 'functional stimulus\r\nstrengthens the organ,' that is to say, that an organ increases through\r\nits own specific activity. Up till that time it had been believed that\r\nit was merely the increased flow of blood that caused the increase in\r\nthe size of a much-used part. Roux showed that there is a 'quantitative\r\nself-regulation of the organ according to the strength of the stimulus\r\nsupplied to it'; that the stimulated organ, that is, the organ which\r\nis performing its normal function, may, in spite of the increased\r\nbreaking down or combustion (dissimilation), assimilate all the more\r\nrapidly; that its used-up material is 'over-compensated,' and that\r\ntherefore it grows. He called this the 'trophic' or nutritive effect of\r\nthe stimulus, and in terms of this he explained the increase and the\r\nheightened functional capacity of the much-used organ. Conversely, he\r\nreferred the decrease of a disused organ to 'functional atrophy,' which\r\nsets in when there is a deficient compensation for the substance used\r\nup in the metabolism.\r\n\r\nBut if we press for deeper analysis, we must ask: 'On what does this\r\ntrophic effect of functional stimulus depend?' Roux could not answer\r\nthis question when he wrote, nor can we do so now, as Plate has justly\r\nemphasized. We are here face to face with the fundamental phenomenon\r\nof life, metabolism; and, since we do not understand the causes of\r\nthis, we are not in a position to say why it varies in this way or in\r\nthat according to the 'stimulus.' But the fact itself is certain that\r\nthe organs respond up to a certain point to the claims made upon them;\r\nthey increase in proportion as they function more frequently or more\r\nvigorously, they are able to respond to increased functional demands,\r\nand this Roux has called 'functional adaptation.' As an animal adapts\r\nitself to the claims of the conditions of its life, for instance, by\r\ntaking on a green or a brown protective colour according as it lives\r\non green or brown parts of plants, so the individual organ adapts\r\nitself to the strength of the stimulus which impels it to function,\r\nand increases or decreases in proportion to it. If _one_ kidney in Man\r\ndegenerate, or be surgically removed, the other begins to grow, and\r\ngoes on increasing until it has reached nearly twice its former size.\r\nThe specific stimulus which is brought to bear upon it by the urea\r\ncontained in the blood, and which forces it to grow, is twice as great\r\nin the absence of the other kidney, and therefore the remaining kidney\r\ngrows in response to the increased stimulus and its 'trophic effect'\r\nuntil its increase in size has reduced the functional intensity to the\r\nnormal proportion.\r\n\r\nAdaptation of an organ in the opposite direction takes place when the\r\nfunction diminishes or ceases. If a nerve supplying a muscle or a\r\ngland be cut through, the organ concerned begins to degenerate and to\r\nlose its normal structure to a greater or less degree. Sensory nerves\r\nalso degenerate in their peripheral part when they are cut through. In\r\nsuch cases there may be no alteration either in the nutritive mechanism\r\nor in the blood-vessels, &c., but the functional stimulus--in the case\r\nof the muscle, the stimulus from the will--no longer affects the organ,\r\nand its metabolism is so much lowered in consequence that it begins to\r\ndegenerate.\r\n\r\nWhen we admit that the fit adaptation of the organism, as far as we\r\nunderstand it, must depend upon processes of selection, we may refer\r\nthis 'functional adaptation' also to primitive processes of selection,\r\nwhich prevailed at the very beginning of life upon our earth, and\r\nrepresented, so to speak, the first adaptation that was established,\r\nbut we can say nothing with certainty in regard to this matter as long\r\nas we do not understand the essence of assimilation. It is conceivable,\r\nhowever, that a _primary_ adaptiveness may have arisen, so to speak,\r\nabruptly, through a concurrence of favourable circumstances, as we\r\nshall endeavour to show later on when we discuss the beginnings of life.\r\n\r\nEven although we cannot lay bare the primary roots of 'functional\r\nadaptation' we can gain from the fact itself very valuable insight\r\ninto phenomena which would otherwise be unintelligible and mysterious:\r\n_the perfectly adapted structure of many tissues and their power of\r\nadaptation to changed conditions_. In this lies, in the main, the\r\nadvance in our knowledge which is due to Roux's _Kampf der Theile_.\r\n\r\nIf a number of embryonic cells of different capacity, say _A_, _B_, and\r\n_C_, be affected by different kinds of functional stimuli, _a_, _b_,\r\nand _c_, those cells will grow most rapidly which are most frequently\r\naffected by the stimulus appropriate to them. The proportion in which\r\nthe cells _A_, _B_, and _C_ will ultimately be present in the tissues\r\nwill depend upon the frequency with which the stimuli _a_, _b_, and\r\n_c_ act upon the tissue. But the tissue will be still more precisely\r\ndetermined as to its structure if the three kinds of stimuli affect the\r\ncell-mass, not uniformly all over, but only at certain spots, or along\r\nparticular paths, one in this, the other in that. Thus the cells _A_\r\nwill predominate over the cells _B_ and _C_ at all the places which\r\nare most frequently affected by the stimulus _a_, the cells _B_ in the\r\nsphere of the stimulus _b_, and the cells _C_ in that of the stimulus\r\n_c_; there they will increase most rapidly and so crowd out the other\r\nkinds of cells, and thus a spatial arrangement will be established\r\nwithin the tissue, a 'structure' which corresponds and is well adapted\r\nto its end. This is what Roux deduced from his _Struggle of the\r\nParts_, and I subsequently defined the process as histonal or tissue\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nLet us first take an example. The anatomist Hermann Meyer showed in\r\n1869 that the so-called 'spongiosa,' that is, the bony tissue of spongy\r\nstructure within the terminal portions of the long bones in Man and\r\nMammals, has a minute structure conspicuously well adapted to its\r\noffice. The thin bone lamellæ of this 'spongiosa' lie precisely in the\r\ndirection of the strongest strain or pressure which is exerted upon the\r\nbone at the particular area. Arch-like in form, they are kept apart by\r\nmeans of buttresses, and no architect could have done better if he had\r\nbeen entrusted with the task of making a complicated system of arches\r\nwith the greatest possible carrying and resisting power combined with\r\nthe greatest possible economy of material.\r\n\r\nThis well-adapted structure is now interpreted through the _Struggle of\r\nthe Parts_ as a self-differentiation, for if there be in the rudiments\r\nor primordia of the bone differently endowed elements[10], that is,\r\ncells which respond in diverse ways to different stimuli, these must\r\narrange themselves locally, owing to the struggle for space and food,\r\nin a manner corresponding to the distribution of the different stimuli\r\nin the bone. The largest amount of bone substance will be formed in the\r\ndirections of the strongest strain and the greatest pressure, because\r\nthe bone-forming cells are excited by this, their functional stimulus,\r\nto growth and multiplication. Thus the buttress and arch structure\r\ncomes about, and between the delicate bone lamellæ spaces will remain\r\nfree, and these, being relieved from the burden of strain and pressure\r\nby the aforesaid bony lamellæ, will offer suitable conditions of life\r\nto cells with other functional properties, such as connective tissue\r\ncells or vascular cells.\r\n\r\n[10] I do not here enter into the question whether we have not in\r\nthis case to do with similar elements, which have the power of\r\ndifferentiating into one or another kind of cell according to the\r\nnature of the external stimuli by which they are influenced.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the bone spongiosa is not everywhere the same,\r\nand it is demonstrably related with precision to the conditions of\r\nstrain and pressure at each particular region. Thus, just below the\r\nsoft cartilaginous covering of the joints there are no long pillars\r\nwith short arches, but only rounded meshes, because the pressure is\r\nhere almost equally strong from all sides. The long parallel pillars\r\nonly occur further down in the bone, and they lie in two directions\r\nwhich intersect each other obliquely, corresponding to the two main\r\ndirections of pressure. But it is only under the functional stimulus\r\nof pressure that the bone-forming cells have an advantage over the\r\nothers, and multiply more quickly, thus crowding out those that are not\r\nattuned to the appropriate functional stimulus.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner Roux interprets, in the light of the struggle of\r\nthe parts, the striking adaptations in the course, the branching, and\r\nthe lumen-formation of the blood-vessels, in the direction of the\r\nintersecting connective tissue strands in the tail-fin of the dolphin,\r\nin the direction of the fibres in the tympanum, and in many other\r\nadaptations in the histological structure of complex tissues.\r\n\r\nIn this there is manifestly an important step of progress, for it is\r\nobvious that the direction of the bone-lamellæ and such like could not\r\nhave been determined by individual selection, and the same is true\r\nin regard to many other histological details. It cannot be disputed,\r\nhowever, that there is a kind of selection-process here also, similar\r\nto that which we think of, with Darwin and Wallace, as occurring\r\nbetween individual organisms. Just as in the latter, which we shall\r\nhenceforward call _personal selection_, variability and inheritance\r\nlead, in the struggle for existence, to the survival of the fittest,\r\nso, in histonal differentiation, the same three factors lead to the\r\nvictory of what is best suited to the parts of the body in question.\r\nThe tissues and the parts of the tissues have to distribute and\r\narrange themselves so that each comes to fill the place in which it\r\nis most effectively and frequently affected by its specific stimulus,\r\nthat is, the stimulus in regard to which it is superior to other\r\nparts; but these places are also those the occupation of which by\r\nthe best re-acting parts makes the whole tissue capable of more\r\neffective function, and therefore makes its structure the fittest.\r\nVariability--in this case that of embryonic cells, with different\r\nprimary constituents--must be assumed; inheritance is implied in\r\nthe multiplication of the cells by division; and the 'struggle for\r\nexistence' here assumes its frequent form of a competition for food\r\nand space; the cells which assimilate more rapidly because of the\r\nmore frequent functional stimulus increase more rapidly, draw away\r\nnourishment from the more slowly-multiplying cells around them, and\r\nthus crowd these out to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\nWe might even speak of histonal selection among unicellulars, for it\r\nis conceivable that in primitive living substance, such as that of a\r\nmoneron, there may be minute differences among the vital particles,\r\ninvolving also functional distinctions, which, under the influence of\r\ndiverse stimuli, may gradually give rise to an increasingly complex\r\ndifferentiation. For the variations in the primary living substance\r\nmost strongly affected by a particular stimulus would tend to\r\naccumulate at the places most frequently reached by that stimulus, and\r\nwould crowd out other variations at that spot, just as the body and its\r\nindividual parts may be said to have taken their architectural form\r\nin exact response to the demands made upon them by function. In this\r\ncase, of course, personal selection and histonal selection co-operate,\r\nfor every improvement in the organization of the fundamental living\r\nsubstance means at the same time a lasting improvement in the whole\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nIn many-celled organisms, however, we must admit that there is an\r\nessential difference between personal and histonal selection, inasmuch\r\nas the latter can give rise to adaptive structural modifications\r\ncorresponding to the needs of the tissue at the moment, but not to\r\npermanent and cumulative changes in the individual elements of the\r\ntissue. If a broken bone heals crookedly, the spongy substance within\r\nthe healed portion does not remain as it was before, for the pillars\r\nand arches, which now no longer run in the direction best suited to\r\ntheir function, break up, and a new system of arches is formed, not\r\nin line with the earlier one, but adapted to the new conditions of\r\npressure. This is certainly an adaptation through selection, but the\r\nelements, that is the cells which form the bone substance in response\r\nto strain and pressure, or those which in response to the stimulus of\r\nthe blood flowing into the spaces form the blood-vessels, or those\r\nwhich being quite freed from one-sided pressure develop into connective\r\ntissue, must be presupposed. These kinds of cells must be virtually\r\nimplied in the germ-rudiment; they are themselves adaptations of the\r\norganism, and can therefore only be referred to _personal selection_.\r\nAnd this is true of all adaptations of the _elements_ of multicellular\r\norganisms, and thus of the _cells_. Their adaptation according to the\r\nprinciple of division of labour, their differentiation into muscle,\r\nnerve, and gland cells can only be referred to natural selection in the\r\nDarwin-Wallace sense, and cannot depend upon histonal selection. In\r\nthe spongy substance of the bone a better bone-cell does not struggle\r\nwith an inferior one and leave behind it by its survival a host of\r\ndescendants which are, if possible, better than itself; the struggle\r\nfor existence and for descendants, in this case, is between two kinds\r\nof cell which were different from the beginning, and of which one\r\nhas the advantage at one spot, another at another. The case may be\r\ncompared to that of a flock of nearly allied species of bird, of which\r\none species thrives best in the plains, another among the hills, and a\r\nthird among the mountain forests, all mingled together in a vast new\r\nterritory to which they had migrated, and in which all three kinds of\r\nconditions were represented. A struggle would arise among the different\r\nspecies, in which in every case the particular species would be\r\nvictorious which was best adapted to the local conditions. But each\r\nwould thrive best in the region in which it was superior to the others,\r\nand very soon the three species would be distributed as they were in\r\nthe land from which they came--in the plains, the high lands, and the\r\nmountain forests. This would be the result of a struggle between the\r\nthree species, _not between individuals within each species_, and it\r\ncould not therefore bring about an improvement of a single species,\r\nbut only the local prevalence of one or another. The characters which\r\nmade one species adapted for the plain, another for the mountain forest\r\nwere _already there_; they can only be referred to personal selection,\r\nwhich brought about the adaptation of their ancestors in the course\r\nof ages to the conditions of their life. Something similar is true of\r\nthe adaptations of the tissues; the differentiation of the individual\r\nkinds of cells is an ancient inheritance, and depends upon personal\r\nselection, but their distribution and arrangement into specially\r\nadapted tissues, so far as there is any plasticity at all, depends\r\nupon histonal selection. Obviously, however, only as far as the tissue\r\nis plastic, that is, with the power of adjusting itself to particular\r\nlocal conditions. Only adaptations of this kind can be referred to\r\nhistonal selection; the ground-plan, even of the most complicated\r\ntissue, such as the large glands of mammals, the kidneys, the liver,\r\nand so on, must have been implicit in the germ, and must therefore be\r\nreferred to personal selection. A precise limitation of the respective\r\nspheres of action of personal selection and histonal selection is not\r\npossible as yet, since hardly any investigations on the subject are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nRoux undoubtedly over-estimated the influence of his 'struggle\r\nof parts' when he believed that the most delicate adaptations of\r\nthe different kinds of cells depended on it. I admit that, for a\r\nconsiderable time, I made the same mistake, until it became clear to\r\nme, as it did first in regard to the sex-cells, that this is not, and\r\ncannot be the case. How, for instance, could the diverse and minutely\r\ndetailed adaptations of the sex-cells--which we are to discuss in a\r\nsubsequent lecture--have arisen in this way? As far as the individual\r\nsperm-cell is concerned, it is a matter of indifference whether its\r\nhead is a little thinner or thicker, its point a little sharper\r\nor blunter, its tail a little stronger or weaker. This does not\r\ndecide whether the cell is to thrive better, or to occur in greater\r\nnumbers than some other variety. But it does decide whether it is to\r\nbe able to penetrate through the minute micropyle, or through the\r\nfirm egg-envelope, into the egg, there to effect fertilization. An\r\nindividual with less well formed sperm-cells will be able to fertilize\r\nfewer eggs, and therefore to leave fewer descendants which might\r\ninherit its tendency to produce inferior sperm-cells, and conversely.\r\nThus it is not the sperm-cells of any one individual which are selected\r\naccording to their fitness, it is the individuals themselves which\r\ncompete with one another in the production of germ-cells which shall\r\nfertilize best, that is, most certainly. The struggle is thus not\r\nintercellular, but a struggle between persons.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of all cells differentiated for particular functions;\r\nevery new kind of glandular, muscular, or nerve cell, such as have\r\narisen a thousandfold in the course of phylogeny, can only have\r\nresulted from a struggle between individuals which turned on the\r\npossession of the best cells of a particular kind, _not from a struggle\r\nbetween the cells themselves_, since these would gain no advantage\r\nfrom serving the organism, as a whole, better than others of their\r\nkind. In regard to the sex-cells we might admit, in addition to\r\npersonal selection, the possibility of an internal struggle between the\r\nsperm-cells or egg-cells of the same individual, inasmuch as each of\r\nthese cells is the primordium of a new individual, and as those better\r\nadapted for reproduction might transmit their better quality to these\r\nnew individuals. I will not here enter into my reasons for regarding\r\nthis idea as erroneous, for in any case this interpretation would not\r\napply to any other kind of cells. If, for instance, it were a question\r\nof the transformation of an ordinary mucus or salivary gland into a\r\npoison gland, it would not matter in the least to the individual cell\r\nwhether it yielded a harmless or a poisonous secretion; but individuals\r\nwith many poisonous cells would have an advantage in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nI agree so far with Plate when he refers the differentiation of\r\nthe tissues entirely to personal selection, but not in his further\r\nconclusion that histonal selection does not exist. The ground-plan\r\nof the architectural structure of the organ depends upon personal\r\nselection, but the realization of the plan in particular cases is\r\nnot predetermined down to the minutest details, but is regulated by\r\nhistonal selection, and is thus to a certain extent an adaptation to\r\nlocal conditions of stimulus. The direction, strength, and size of\r\nevery single bone lamella is not predetermined from the germ, but only\r\nthe occurrence and nature of bone-cells and bone lamellæ in general.\r\nThe direction and the strength which these bone lamellæ may assume\r\ndepends on the local conditions of strain and pressure which affect the\r\ncell-mass, as is shown very clearly by the spongiosa of an obliquely\r\nhealed bone, which we have already described.\r\n\r\nBut let us now turn to the question which is here most important for\r\nus: _whether functional adaptations can be transmitted_. We must\r\nadmit that the insight we have so far gained into the causes of these\r\nadaptations does not make it much easier to answer the question.\r\nHistonal selection is a purely _local_ process of adaptation to the\r\nconditions of stimuli prevailing at the moment, and no one will be\r\nlikely to suppose that the distorted position of the spongiosa of\r\na badly healed fracture could reappear in the straight bone of a\r\ndescendant; this would be quite contrary to the principle, for the\r\ncrooked lamellæ would in that case no longer be the best adapted. Even\r\nthe question _whether the strengthening of a muscle through use can be\r\ntransmitted_ cannot be answered in the light of the knowledge we have\r\nhitherto gained. The 'trophic effect of the functional stimulus' is\r\nbrought into activity through entirely local influences, through which\r\nonly the parts most strongly affected by the stimulus can be caused to\r\nvary. Thus the problem remains unaltered, How can purely local changes,\r\nnot based in the germ, but called forth by the chances of life, be\r\ntransmitted to descendants?\r\n\r\nIf all species, even in the highest groups, reproduced by dividing\r\ninto two, we might imagine that a direct transmission of the changes\r\nacquired in the course of the individual life through use or disuse\r\ntook place, though this would presuppose a much more complicated\r\nmechanism than is apparent at first sight. But it is well known that\r\nmultiplication by fission is for the most part restricted to simple\r\norganisms, and that the great majority of modern plants and animals\r\nreproduce by means of germ-cells, which develop within the organism in\r\nregions often very remote from the parts, the results of the exercise\r\nof which are said to be transmitted. Moreover, the germ-cells are of\r\nvery simple structure, at least as far as our eyes can discern; for\r\nwe see in a germ-cell neither muscles nor bones nor ligaments, glands\r\nnor nerves, but only a cell-body consisting of that semifluid living\r\nmatter to which the general name of protoplasm has been given, and of\r\na nucleus, in regard to which we cannot say that it differs in any\r\nessential or definite way from the nucleus of any other cell. How then\r\ncould the changes which take place in a muscle through exercise, or\r\nin the degeneration of a joint in consequence of disuse, communicate\r\nthemselves to a germ-cell lying inside the body, and do so in such\r\na fashion that this germ-cell is able, when it grows into a new\r\norganism, to produce of itself, in the relevant muscle and joint, a\r\nchange the same as that which had arisen in the parent through use and\r\ndisuse? That is the question which forced itself upon me very early,\r\nand in following it up I have been led to an absolute denial of the\r\ntransmission of this kind of 'acquired characters.'\r\n\r\nIn order to explain how I reached this result, and what it is\r\nbased upon, it is indispensable that we should first make ourselves\r\nacquainted with the phenomena of heredity in general, and the\r\ninseparably associated phenomena of reproduction, so that we may form\r\nsome sort of theoretic conception of the process of inheritance--a\r\npicture, necessarily provisional and imperfect, of the mechanism\r\nwhich enables the germ-cell to reproduce the whole organism, and not\r\nmerely, like other cells, others like itself. We are thus led to an\r\ninvestigation of reproduction and heredity, at the conclusion of which\r\nwe shall feel justified in returning to the question of the inheritance\r\nof acquired characters, in order to give a verdict as to the retention\r\nor dismissal of the Lamarckian principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XIII\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION IN UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS\r\n\r\n Reproduction by division--In Amœbæ--In Infusorians--Divisions\r\n following one another in immediate succession--Formation of germ-cells\r\n in the Metazoa--Contrast between germ-cells and body-cells--Potential\r\n immortality of unicellular organisms--Beginning of natural\r\n death--Budding and division in the Metazoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE wish to consider the reproduction of organisms with special\r\nreference to the problem of heredity, and it is most instructive to\r\nbegin with the lowest forms of life--the unicellulars--because their\r\nstructure, as far as we can see with the instruments at our command,\r\nis very simple, and, what is even more important, is relatively\r\nhomogeneous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59. An Amœba: the process of division. _A_, before\r\nthe beginning of the division. _B_, the nucleus divided into two. _C_,\r\nthe two daughter-Amœbæ. Magnified about 400 times.]\r\n\r\nSuppose that there are bacteria-like organisms of quite homogeneous\r\nstructure, and that these multiply by simply dividing into two, each\r\nrod-like creature dividing transversely in the middle of its length,\r\nthe two halves would represent independent daughter-organisms, whose\r\nstructure would correspond exactly with that of the mother-organism,\r\ncould not indeed in any way deviate from it, and consequently would\r\ntake over all its characters, that is, would inherit them. The size\r\nof body is the only feature which is not obviously inherited, but\r\nin reality it is potentially heritable, since the structure of the\r\ndivided portions involves the capacity and the limits of their possible\r\ngrowth. Moreover, the size of body is not invariable in any species;\r\na particular size is only reproduced under similar conditions of\r\ndevelopment. Inheritance here consists simply in a continuation of the\r\nmother-organism into its two daughter-cells.\r\n\r\nEven in an Amœba (Fig. 59) we might picture the process of inheritance\r\nas equally simple, though in so doing we should probably be making a\r\nfallacious inference, for the structure of these lowest unicellular\r\nanimals probably seems to us simpler and more homogeneous than it\r\nreally is. Among Infusorians it is quite obvious that inheritance\r\nimplies more than the mere halving of the mother-animal into the two\r\ndaughter-cells; something more must be involved. For among these\r\nunicellular animals the differentiation of the body is not only\r\ngreat, but it is unsymmetrical. The posterior and the anterior ends\r\nare different, and the transverse division of the animal, in which\r\nthe process of reproduction here consists, does not produce two\r\nhalves, but two very unequal portions. In the division of _Stentor_,\r\nthe so-called trumpet-animalcule (Fig. 60), the anterior portion\r\ncontains the funnel-shaped mouth and gullet with its complicated\r\nnutritive apparatus, the circular peristome with its spirally curved\r\nrows of composite ciliated plates, the so-called membranellæ, and so\r\nforth; the posterior half contains nothing of all this, but possesses\r\nthe foot of the mother-Stentor with its attaching organ, which the\r\nanterior half lacks. But each of the two portions possesses the\r\npower of 'regeneration,' that is, it is able to develop anew the\r\nmissing parts, mouth or foot, and so on. So that here there is no\r\nlonger merely a simple continuance of the maternal organization in\r\nthe daughter-animals, there is something new added, something which\r\nrequires explanation; we are confronted with the first riddle of\r\nheredity. Simple growth does not explain the phenomenon, for what has\r\nto be added to complete the halved portions has a different structure,\r\na different form, different accessory apparatus from any that the\r\nhalves themselves possess. It in no way affects this state of matters\r\nthat in the normal process of division in Infusorians the formation\r\nof the new mouth and peristome-region begins before the halves have\r\nactually separated, for even if a Stentor be cut in two artificially\r\nthe cut halves form complete animals. And, indeed, a Stentor may be cut\r\ninto three or four pieces, and in certain conditions each piece will\r\ndevelop into a complete animal. These pieces must therefore possess\r\nsomething more than the mere power of growth. We shall try later on to\r\ndiscover whether this marvellous invisible transmission of characters,\r\nthis implication of the whole in each of the parts, can be in any\r\nway theoretically expressed and included in our scheme of conceptual\r\nformulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60. _Stentor rœselii_, trumpet-animalcule.\r\nProcess of division. _wsp_, ciliated spiral leading to the mouth\r\n(_m_); _cv_, contractile vacuole. _A_, in preparation for division,\r\nthe nucleus (_k_) has coalesced into a long twisted band. _B_, a\r\nsecond ciliated spiral (_wsp´_) has begun to be formed; the nucleus\r\n(_k_) is contracted. _C_, just before the constricting off of the two\r\ndaughter-Stentors.

After Stein.]\r\n\r\nNow that we have become familiar with these facts it will no longer\r\nsurprise us to learn that the reproduction of unicellular animals does\r\nnot always depend on _equal_ division, but that unequal spontaneous\r\ndivisions are also possible, so that one or several smaller portions of\r\nthe cell-body, containing a portion of the cell-nucleus, can separate\r\noff from the mother-animal. This occurs especially among the suctorial\r\nInfusorians or Acinetæ. In relation to the phenomena of inheritance the\r\nproblem raised by the equal division of the Infusorians repeats itself,\r\nand it is in no way affected by the fact that equal division can take\r\nplace several times, or many times in succession, so that from one\r\nanimal a large number of small pieces of the same size may be produced\r\nin rapid succession. The characteristic marks of the mother-animal are\r\nnot infrequently lost sight of, wholly or partially, when this occurs,\r\nand the divided portions seem to consist of a homogeneous cell-body\r\nand nucleus; but they possess the power of regenerating themselves, or\r\nof developing, if the expression be preferred, into animals similar\r\nto the maternal-organism. Such divided portions might very well be\r\ncalled germs, only it must not be forgotten that the relation of the\r\nmother-animal to these germs is a different one from that of a higher\r\nanimal or plant to its germ-cells; the unicellular animal breaks up by\r\ncontinued division into these 'germs,' while the Metazoon continues its\r\nindividual existence unimpaired by the production of its germ-cells.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a so-called 'spore-formation' is to be found in many\r\nInfusorians. Thus the holotrichous species, _Holophrya multifiliis_\r\n(Fig. 61), reproduces by first becoming enclosed in a cyst or capsule,\r\nand then dividing many times in rapid succession, so that 2, 4, 8,\r\n16, &c. individuals arise consecutively, and subsequently burst forth\r\nfrom the cyst (Fig. 61, _B_). In the Gregarines and other Sporozoa the\r\nperiod of division lasts much longer, and the encysted animal divides\r\ninto 128, 256, or even more portions; but in this case also each part\r\nor 'spore' receives a piece of the maternal cell-body and cell-nucleus,\r\nso that there is no difference in principle between this and the simple\r\ndivision into two exhibited by _Stentor_; as in that case, so here,\r\nit is not the fully differentiated structure of the animal which is\r\nhanded on to the divided parts; it is only the power to redevelop this\r\nanew on their own account. Thus here again we are face to face with the\r\nfundamental problem of heredity: How is it possible that the power of\r\nreproducing the complex whole can be inherent in the simple parts?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61. _Holophrya multifiliis_, an Infusorian\r\nparasitic on the skin of fishes. _A_, in its usual condition; _ma_,\r\nmacronucleus; _mi_, micronucleus; _cv_, contractile vacuole; _m_,\r\nmouth. _B_, after binary fission has been several times repeated within\r\nthe cyst (_cy_); _tt_, results of the division. _C_, one of these units\r\nmuch enlarged.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the unicellular organisms, the great majority of the\r\nmulticellulars, the Metazoa and Metaphyta, many-celled animals and\r\nplants, differ not only in the multitude of their cells, but even\r\nmore in the manifold differentiation of these cells according to the\r\nprinciple of division of labour, so that the various functions of\r\nthe animal are not performed by all the cells uniformly, but each\r\nfunction is relegated to a particular set of cells specially organized\r\nwith reference to it. Thus there is differentiation between motile,\r\nnutritive, and reproductive cells, and there may also be glandular,\r\nnerve, muscle, and skin cells, and we know how this differentiation\r\ninto a great number of different kinds of cells with highly specialized\r\nfunctions has arisen, especially among the higher animals, in a\r\nmultiplicity which cannot easily be overlooked. Thus we find a large\r\nnumber of the most diverse kinds of cells, all of which serve for\r\nthe maintenance of the body, in contrast to the simply reproductive\r\ncells or germ-cells. These alone possess the power of reproducing,\r\nunder certain conditions, a new individual of the same species. We can\r\ncontrast with these germ-cells, which serve, not for the maintenance of\r\nthe individual, but only for that of the species, all the other kinds\r\nof cells under the name of somatic or body-cells. The problem which we\r\nhave to solve now lies before us in the question, How comes it that\r\nthe germ-cell is able to bring forth from itself all the other cells\r\nin definite sequence and arrangement, and is thus able to build up the\r\nbody of a new individual?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. _Pandorina morum_; after Pringsheim. I, A young\r\ncolony, consisting of 16 cells. II, Another colony, whose cells have\r\nreproduced daughter-colonies; all the cells uniformly alike. III, A\r\nyoung Volvox-colony; _sz_, somatic cells; _kz_, germ-cells.]\r\n\r\nThe similarity of this problem to that formulated in regard to\r\nunicellular organisms is at once obvious, but it becomes still more\r\nemphatic when we remember that the gulf between unicellular organisms\r\nand the higher animals and plants is bridged over by certain transition\r\nforms which are of the greatest interest, especially in relation to the\r\nproblems of inheritance.\r\n\r\nAmong the lower Algæ there is a family, the Volvocineæ, in which the\r\ndifferentiation of the many-celled body on the principle of division of\r\nlabour has just set in; in some genera it has been actually effected,\r\nthough in the simplest way imaginable, and in others it has not yet\r\nbegun. Thus in the genus _Pandorina_ the individual consists of sixteen\r\ngreen cells, united into a ball (Fig. 62, I), each one exactly like the\r\nother, and all functioning alike. They are all united into a spherical\r\nbody, a whole, by a gelatinous matrix which they all secrete, and thus\r\nthey form a cell-colony, a cell-stock, a many-celled individual; but\r\neach of these cells has not only all the typical parts--cell-body,\r\nnucleus, and contractile vacuole--but each possesses a pair of flagella\r\nor motor organs, an eye-spot, and a chlorophyll body which enables\r\nthem to assimilate nourishment from the water and the air. Each one\r\nof these cells thus performs all the somatic functions, that is, all\r\nthat are necessary to the maintenance of the individual life. But each\r\nalso possesses the power of reproducing the whole colony from itself,\r\nthat is, it also performs the function of reproduction necessary to\r\nthe maintenance of the species. When such a colony, whose sixteen\r\ncells are continually growing, has led for some time a free-swimming\r\nlife in the water, the cells retract their flagella, and each begins\r\nto multiply by dividing into 2, 4, 8, finally into 16 cells of the\r\nsame kind, which remain together, forming a spherical mass enclosed in\r\na gelatinous secretion (Fig. 62, II). Thus there are now, instead of\r\nsixteen cells in the mother-colony, sixteen daughter-colonies, each\r\nwith sixteen cells which soon acquire flagella and eye-spots, and are\r\nthen ready to burst forth from the dissolving jelly of the maternal\r\nstock as independent individuals. This _Pandorina_ shows no trace of\r\na differentiation of its component cells to particular and different\r\nfunctions, but a nearly allied genus of the same family, the genus\r\n_Volvox_ (Fig. 62, III), consists of two kinds of cells--on the one\r\nhand of small cells (_sz_) which occur in large numbers and compose the\r\nwall of the hollow gelatinous mass, forming, so to speak, the skeleton\r\nof the _Volvox_; and, on the other hand, of a much smaller number of\r\ncells which are very much larger (_kz_). The former, the 'body' or\r\n'somatic' cells, are green, and have a red 'eye-spot' and two flagella;\r\nthey are connected with each other by processes from their cell-bodies,\r\nand are able, by means of the co-ordinated action of their flagella,\r\nto propel the whole colony with a slow rotatory movement through the\r\nwater. Many of my readers are doubtless familiar with these light green\r\nspheres, which are quite recognizable with the naked eye, and people\r\nour marsh pools and ponds in Spring in such abundance that it is only\r\nnecessary to draw a glass of water to procure a large number of them.\r\n\r\nThe little flagellated cells just described serve not only for the\r\nlocomotion of the colony, but also for nutrition, for the secretion\r\nof the jelly, and for the excretion of waste products; in short, they\r\nperform all the functions necessary to the maintenance of life, but\r\nnot that of reproduction. They can, indeed, multiply by dividing when\r\nthe colony is young, like the cells of _Pandorina_, but they cannot\r\nreproduce the whole colony but only cells like themselves, that is,\r\nother somatic cells. In _Volvox_ the maintenance of the species, the\r\nproduction of a daughter-colony, is the function of the second and\r\nlarger kind of cells, the reproductive cells, which are contained in\r\nthe interior (filled with a watery fluid) of the gelatinous sphere.\r\nThey possess no flagella (_kz_), and so take no share in the swimming\r\nmovements of the somatic cells. For the present we need not allude to\r\nthe fact that there are several kinds of these cells, and need only\r\nstate that the simplest among them, the so-called 'Parthenogonidia,'\r\nafter they have reached a considerable size, begin a process of\r\ndivision which results in the formation of a daughter-colony. Usually\r\nthere are several of these large reproductive cells in a _Volvox_\r\ncolony, and as soon as these have developed into a similar number of\r\ndaughter-colonies they burst out through a rupture in the now flaccid\r\njelly of the maternal sphere and begin to lead an independent life. The\r\nmother-sphere, which now consists only of somatic cells, is unable to\r\nproduce new reproductive cells; it gradually loses its spherical form,\r\nsinks to the ground, and dies.\r\n\r\nIn _Volvox_ we have, for the first time, a cell-colony in which a\r\ndistinction has been established between body or somatic cells and\r\nreproductive or germ-cells. In contrast to _Pandorina_, a large number,\r\nindeed the majority of the cells of the colony, have lost the power\r\nof reproducing the whole by division, and only the few reproductive\r\ncells possess this, while they, in turn, have lost other functions,\r\nnotably that of locomotion. Their power of reproducing the whole, that\r\nis to say, their hereditary capacity, gives them a greater theoretical\r\ninterest than the cells of _Pandorina_, for the latter require only to\r\nproduce others like themselves, because there is only one kind of cell\r\nin the colony, while in _Volvox_ the reproductive cell can not only\r\nproduce others like itself, by division, but can produce the body-cells\r\nas well. The problem is quite analogous to the one which we have had\r\nto face in regard to the unicellular animals of complex structure, the\r\nInfusorians. The question, How can the part of the trumpet-animalcule\r\nwhich is mouthless develop from itself a new mouth and ciliated\r\napparatus? here transforms itself into the question, How can a cell\r\nby division give rise not only to others like itself, but also to the\r\nbody-cells, which are of quite different structure? This is, in its\r\nsimplest form, the fundamental problem of all reproduction through\r\ngerm-cells, to which we must now pass on. But first a short digression.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted that unicellular organisms multiply by division,\r\nand originally, as well as in the great majority of cases to-day, by\r\ndivision into two. It follows, therefore, that there is no _natural_\r\ndeath among them, for, if there were, the species would die out as\r\nthe individuals grew old; but this does not happen. The two daughter\r\norganisms which arise from the binary fission of an Infusorian are\r\nin no way different in regard to their power of life; each of them\r\npossesses an equal power of doubling itself again by division, and\r\nso it goes on, as far as we can see, for an unlimited time. Thus the\r\nunicellular organisms are not subject to natural death; their body is\r\nindeed used up in the course of ordinary life so that the formation of\r\nnew cilia and so on is necessary, but it is not worn away in the same\r\nsense in which our body is and that of all Metazoa and Metaphytes,\r\nwhere, through functioning, the organs are gradually worn away until\r\nthey become incapable of function. Our body grows old, and can at last\r\nno longer continue to live; but among unicellular organisms there is\r\nno growing old, and no death in the normal course of the development\r\nof the individual. The unicellulars are, as we may say, immortal; that\r\nis, while individuals may be annihilated, by external agencies, boiling\r\nheat, poisons, being crushed, or eaten, and so on, at every period\r\nsome individuals escape such a fate, and perpetuate themselves through\r\nsucceeding ages. For, strictly speaking, the daughter-individual\r\nis only a continuation of the mother-individual; it contains not\r\nonly half of the substance, but also the organization, and life is\r\ncontinued directly from mother to daughter. The daughter is simply\r\nhalf of the mother, which is subsequently regenerated; and the other\r\nhalf of the mother lives on in the other daughter, so that nothing\r\ndies in this multiplication. It may be said that the daughter has to\r\ndevelop the other half of its body anew, and that therefore it is a\r\nnew individuality, and not merely a continuation of the old, and that\r\ntherefore the unicellular animals are not immortal. The 'immortality'\r\nof the Protozoa may be scoffed at; the idea may seem absurd that the\r\n'immortal' Protozoa are still the same individuals which lived upon\r\nthe earth millions of years ago, but all such objections mean no more\r\nthan doctrinaire quibbling with the concepts of 'individual' and\r\n'immortality,' which do not exist in nature at all, but are mere human\r\nabstractions, and therefore only of relative value. My thesis as to the\r\npotential immortality of the Unicellulars aims at nothing more than\r\nimpressing on Science the fact that the occurrence of physiological,\r\nthat is, natural, death is causally associated with the transition\r\nfrom single-celled to many-celled organisms; and this is a truth which\r\nwill not be overthrown by any sophisms. It is the Volvocineæ which\r\nshow us, so to speak, the exact point at which natural death set in,\r\nat which it was introduced into the world of life. In _Pandorina_ the\r\nstate of things is still the same as in single-celled organisms, for\r\neach cell is still all in all, each can bring forth the whole, none\r\ndies from physiological causes involved in the course of development,\r\nand they are therefore 'immortal' in the sense stated. But in _Volvox_\r\nthe 'individual' dies when it has given off its reproductive cells,\r\nbecause here the contrast between germ-cells and body has developed.\r\nOnly the body is mortal in the sense of being subject to natural death;\r\nthe germ-cells possess the potential immortality of the single-celled\r\nanimals, and it is necessary that they should possess it if the species\r\nis to continue to exist.\r\n\r\nFrom this alone it does not seem quite clear why the body or soma\r\nshould be subject to death, and when I first endeavoured to arrive at\r\nclearness in regard to these matters I tried to find out why a natural\r\ndeath of the body was necessitated by the course of evolution. I did\r\nnot at once discover the true explanation, but without delaying to\r\ndiscuss my mistakes I shall proceed to expound what I believe to be the\r\ntrue reason. It lies simply in the fact, which we shall inquire into\r\nlater on in more detail, that every function and every organ disappears\r\nas soon as it becomes superfluous for the maintenance of the particular\r\nform of life in question. The power of being able to live on without\r\nlimit is useless for the somatic cells, and thus also for the body,\r\nsince these cannot produce new reproductive cells after those that had\r\nbeen present are liberated; and with this the individual ceases to be\r\nof any value for the preservation of the species. What advantage would\r\nit be to the species if the _Volvox_ balls were to continue living for\r\nan unlimited time after the reproductive cells were developed and had\r\nbeen liberated? Obviously their further fate can have no influence\r\nwhatever in determining or preserving the characters of the species,\r\nand it is quite indifferent to the continuance of the species whether\r\nand how long they go on living. Therefore the soma has lost the\r\ncapacity which conditions endless continuance of life and continued\r\nrenewal of body-cells.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these views it has been asked jeeringly, how\r\n'immortality,' if it were really a property of the Unicellulars and of\r\nundifferentiated cell-colonies, could be lost, as if the world, which\r\nwe believe to be everlasting, should give up its everlastingness.\r\nBut the jeer recoils on the superficial outlook which is unable to\r\ndistinguish between the immortality dreamed of by the poets, religious\r\nand secular, and the real power that certain forms of life have to\r\nresist being permanently exhausted by their own metabolism. That\r\nwe should call this 'immortality' does not seem to me to require\r\nany apology, for the right has always been conceded to science to\r\ntransfer popular words and ideas in a restricted and somewhat altered\r\nsense to scientific conceptions when it seems necessary. That the\r\nword 'immortality' in this case expresses the state of matters more\r\nprecisely and better than any other cannot be doubted, any more than\r\nwe can doubt that there exists in regard to natural death a real\r\ndifference, which we must take account of, between the Unicellulars\r\nand the higher organisms. What enables the species in the case of the\r\nhigher organisms, like ourselves for instance, to last through ages is\r\nnot the immortality of the individual, of the person, but only that\r\nof the germ-cells; these alone, among the cells of the whole body,\r\nhave retained the primæval power. A small piece of the individual is\r\nstill immortal, but only a minute part, which cannot be considered as\r\nequivalent to the whole, either morphologically or from the point of\r\nview of the conception of individuality. Can anyone consider himself\r\nidentical with his children? If any one should imagine this, it would\r\nstill not be the case, for he himself would in the course of time\r\nsuffer natural death, and his children would continue to live on until\r\nthey too had brought forth children, and in their turn also came to\r\ndie. It is quite different with an Infusorian, which never lies down to\r\ndie, but simply splits itself afresh into two halves which continue to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly credible that such a simple and clear truth should have\r\nremained so long undiscovered, and it is even more incredible that\r\nsince it was enunciated it should have been until quite recently\r\nlaughed at as false, as a piece of pseudo-science, and as valueless.\r\nBut it is the fate of all knowledge which rests on an intelligent and\r\ncomprehensive working up of facts to be attacked, until it gradually\r\nbears down antagonism by the weight of its truth, and compels at least\r\na silent recognition.\r\n\r\nThe fact that natural death made its appearance with the appearance of\r\na 'body,' a soma, as distinguished from the germ-cells, will sooner or\r\nlater compel recognition. When I pointed out above that the explanation\r\nof natural death lay in the fact that it would be superfluous for the\r\nsoma to continue to live on unlimitedly, after it had discharged its\r\ngerm-cells, and so fulfilled its duty to the species, I only intended\r\nto say that this was the general reason for the introduction of natural\r\ndeath. I have no doubt that the actual beginning of this phenomenon\r\ncould have, and probably did come about in other ways. Many kinds of\r\ncells in higher animals perish as a result of their function; it is,\r\nso to speak, their business to perish, to break up; this is the case\r\nwith many glandular and epithelial cells. It may very well be that, in\r\nmany of the highly differentiated tissue-cells, such as nerve, muscle,\r\nand glandular cells, the high differentiation in itself excludes the\r\npossibility of unlimited length of life and multiplication. Through\r\nthis alone, therefore, the exhaustion of the body and an ultimate\r\ndeath may be explicable from internal causes. But the deeper cause\r\nremains what I have already indicated, for it is obvious that if the\r\ncontinued life, that is, the immortality of the soma, were necessary\r\nto the preservation of the species it would have survived through\r\nnatural selection; that is to say, had it been so, then histological\r\ndifferentiations incompatible with immortality would not have made\r\ntheir appearance; they would always have been eliminated on their way\r\nto development, since only that which is adapted to its end survives.\r\nOnly if the immortality of the soma were indifferent for the species\r\ncould the soma have become so highly organized that it became subject\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nThus the old song of the transitoriness of life does not apply to\r\nall the forms of life: natural death is a phenomenon which made its\r\nappearance comparatively late in the development of the organic world,\r\na phenomenon which, up to a certain point, we can quite well understand\r\nfrom the standpoint of purposefulness.\r\n\r\nIt would take me too far from the goal towards which we are at present\r\nmaking if I were now to attempt to show, in connexion with natural\r\ndeath, that the durability of the soma, or what we usually call\r\nthe normal duration of life, is also exactly regulated by natural\r\nselection, so that each species possesses exactly that duration of life\r\nwhich is most favourable to it, according to its physical constitution,\r\nits physiological capacity, and the conditions of life to which it has\r\nto adapt itself[11]. But, interesting as this subject is, I must not\r\ndigress further, but return to our proper subject of study, namely,\r\nreproduction in its relation to inheritance.\r\n\r\n[11] See Weismann, _Ueber die Dauer des Lebens_, Jena, 1882. Translated\r\nin _Essays on Heredity_.\r\n\r\nWe digressed from this study after having seen that all, even the most\r\ncomplex, multicellular plants and animals, in which the differentiation\r\nof the cells into a number of cell-groups with the most diverse\r\nfunctions has attained the highest degree of complexity, are able\r\nto produce special cells, the germ-cells, which have the power of\r\nreproducing from themselves another organism of the same species, and\r\nwith the same complex structure. It might be thought that such cells\r\nmust necessarily be very complex in their own structure, but in most\r\ncases nothing of the kind is to be seen, and the germ-cells often\r\nappear simpler in organization than many of the tissue-cells, such as\r\nthe glandular-cells; and where there is an unusual size or complexity\r\nof structure in the germ-cell it usually bears no relation to the\r\ngrade of organization of the young creature that is to arise from it,\r\nbut is due solely to the special conditions imposed on the particular\r\ngerm-cell, if a young organism is to be evolved from it. We shall soon\r\nsee what is meant by this.\r\n\r\nI must note here that plants and animals do not multiply by means of\r\ngerm-cells alone, but that many species--the majority of plants and\r\nthe simpler forms of animals--also exhibit multiplication by budding\r\nor division. All animals and plants which do not stop short at the\r\nstage of the individual, the 'person,' but rise to the higher stage\r\nof the 'stock' (or corm), illustrate this. The first person from\r\nwhich the formation of the stock proceeds gives rise by budding or\r\ndivision to new persons which remain attached to it, and in turn by\r\nrepeated production of buds give rise to a third, fourth, or _n_^{th}\r\ngeneration of persons, all remaining in connexion with the first, and\r\ntogether forming the composite individuality of the animal-colony or\r\nplant-stock. Such colonies or stocks are seen in polyps and corals,\r\nSiphonophoræ and Bryozoa, and among plants, according to Alexander\r\nBraun, in all phanerogams which do not consist only of a single shoot.\r\nIn these cases we find that definite, or perhaps indefinite groups\r\nof cells in the stock may give rise to a new person, and we have to\r\ninquire how this power may be theoretically interpreted.\r\n\r\nNew stocks may also have their origin from such buds, or from single\r\npersons of the stock. The fresh-water polyp (_Hydra_) gives rise by\r\nbudding to a small stock of at most three or four persons; but the\r\nyoung animals budded off only remain attached to the parent hydra\r\nuntil they have attained their full development; then they detach\r\nthemselves and settle down independently, and begin to bud off in turn\r\na similar and transitory stock. Among plants there are many which, like\r\n_Dentaria bulbifera_ and _Marchantia polymorpha_, multiply by so-called\r\n'brood-buds,' that is, buds which fall from the stock and grow into new\r\nplants. The whole horticultural propagation of plants by cuttings also\r\ndepends on the process of budding, for what is cut off from the parent\r\nplant and stuck into the earth is a single shoot, that is, a 'person'\r\nwhich possesses the power of sending down roots into the earth, and by\r\ncontinual budding giving rise to new shoots or persons which together\r\nmake up a new plant-stock.\r\n\r\nI must not, however, spend much time over this so-called 'asexual'\r\nreproduction by budding and division, because it does not suggest\r\nany way by which we may penetrate more deeply into the processes of\r\ninheritance, and we may be content if we can bring them into harmony\r\nwith other theoretical views which we deduce from other phenomena.\r\nThese forms of reproduction were long regarded as the oldest and\r\nthe simplest, and it is only since the time of Francis Balfour that\r\nthe conviction has gradually gained ground that this cannot be so,\r\nbut that they are rather secondary methods of multiplication in the\r\nMetazoa and Metaphyta, which therefore rest on a very complex basis.\r\nWe have seen that the germ-cells made their appearance along with\r\nthe multicellular body, and the step from _Pandorina_ to _Volvox_ is\r\nas small a step as can be well imagined. It is thus proved that the\r\noldest mode of multiplication among multicellular organisms was that\r\nthrough germ-cells, at least along this line of evolution. _Volvox_\r\ndoes not reproduce by dividing, or by the development of buds from\r\nany part of the spherical colony of cells. What is known as budding\r\namong single-celled organisms is only an unequal cell-division, and\r\nhas nothing but its external appearance in common with the budding of\r\nhigher plants and animals. The latter, therefore, is something new, of\r\nlater and independent origin; _the primitive mode is reproduction by\r\nunicellular germs_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XIV\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION BY GERM-CELLS.\r\n\r\n Historical--Differentiation of germ-cells into male and\r\n female--Pandorina--Volvox--Sperm-cells and ova in Algæ--Zoosperm form\r\n of the male germ-cells--Zoosperms of the Barnacles--Adaptation of the\r\n sperm-cells to the conditions of fertilization--Daphnids--Spermatozoa\r\n in different animal groups--Their minute structure--Form and structure\r\n of the egg-cell--Adaptation of the ovum to given conditions--Dimorphic\r\n ova in the same species--Nutritive cells associated with\r\n egg-cells--Complex structure of the bird's egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF we now turn to the reproduction of the Metazoa and Metaphyta by\r\nmeans of germ-cells we find that a great number of lowly plants\r\nproduce germ-cells which require nothing more for the development\r\nof a new plant beyond certain favourable external conditions, above\r\nall, moisture and warmth. Such, for instance, are the 'spores' of the\r\nferns, which are formed on the under surface of the fronds in little\r\nclusters of a brown or yellow colour, easily visible to the naked\r\neye. These spores are individually very small, so that thousands\r\ngo to form one spore-cluster or sporangium, and millions of spores\r\nare given off annually by a single fern. Each spore is a germ-cell\r\nenclosed in a protective capsule, and may, if carried by the wind to\r\na spot favourable to germination, become a young plant, the so-called\r\nprothallium, from which the fern-plant proper subsequently develops.\r\n\r\nThis reproduction by spores has been regarded as a form of 'asexual\r\nreproduction' so-called, and has been classed along with budding and\r\nfission under this head. But it has nothing in common with these\r\nforms of multiplication except the negative character that the act\r\nof fertilization, which we shall inquire into later on, does not in\r\nthis case occur. This mode of classification has no longer any more\r\njustification than the division of the animal kingdom into backboned\r\nand backboneless animals, in which the negative character of the\r\nabsence of vertebræ has led to the slumping of quite heterogeneous\r\nforms in one group. I do not mean to dispute that both these\r\nclassifications were fully justified in their own time; indeed\r\nthey expressed a step of progress. Nowadays, however, the division\r\n'Invertebrata' or 'backboneless animals' as a scientific conception has\r\nbeen abandoned, and the same should be done with the category 'asexual\r\nreproduction,' since it groups together quite different things, such\r\nas multiplication by single-celled and many-celled 'germs,' and is\r\nmoreover based on a quite erroneous idea of what 'fertilization'\r\nreally is. Both terms may very well be retained as a mere matter of\r\nconvenience, but it is much to be desired that the two apt designations\r\nproposed by Haeckel--Monogony for asexual, and Amphigony for sexual\r\nreproduction--should come into general use.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is enough to say that reproduction by 'spores' occurs\r\nnormally in Algæ, fungi, mosses, and fern-like plants, and that\r\nthere are also animals in which the germ-cells possess the power of\r\ngiving rise of themselves to a new individual. But the cases which\r\nI am chiefly thinking of are those of so-called virgin birth or\r\nparthenogenesis, which are not to be compared with multiplication by\r\nspores in regard to their mode of origin; there is a peculiarity in\r\nthe origin of this mode of multiplication which I can only make clear\r\nafter we have studied the normal forms of what is called 'sexual\r\nreproduction.'\r\n\r\nWe shall therefore pass on to this mode of reproduction. It is well\r\nknown that, in all higher animals, just as in Man, an individual cannot\r\nreproduce by itself; the co-operation of two individuals is necessary,\r\nand these--the male and the female--differ essentially from each other\r\nin many particulars. Their union in the act of procreation induces the\r\ndevelopment of a new individual, whether this matures within the mother\r\nin a special receptacle, or whether it is deposited as a 'fertilized\r\negg,' as in birds, the lower vertebrates, and most 'invertebrates.'\r\n\r\nAs long as Man has lived he has regarded this process of procreation as\r\nthe essential factor in the origin of new individuals, and as he had no\r\ninsight into the essence of the process he had necessarily to regard\r\nreproduction as something entirely mysterious, and the co-operation of\r\nthe two sexes as a _conditio sine qua non_ of reproduction in general;\r\nthus copulation and reproduction seemed identical.\r\n\r\nThis was in the main the state of opinion at the time of the discovery\r\nof innumerable minute filaments, the so-called 'spermatozoa' in the\r\n'fertilizing' spermatic fluid of the male. The discovery was made in\r\n1677 by Leeuwenhoek in the case of birds, mammals, and many other\r\nanimals. Albrecht von Haller (1708-77) was at first inclined to regard\r\nthese spermatozoa as the rudiments of the embryo, but later on, in the\r\ncourse of his long life, he withdrew this theory, and declared them\r\nto be a kind of parasite in the spermatic fluid without anything to\r\ndo with fertilization. The same opinion was expressed in 1835 by K.\r\nE. von Baer, in opposition to the opinion of Prevost and Dumas, who\r\nhad rightly interpreted the spermatozoa as the essential elements of\r\nthe spermatic fluid. When one follows the matter out in detail, one\r\nfinds it almost incredible that such a number of mistakes should have\r\nbeen made, and so many circuitous paths traversed, before even the\r\nlimited knowledge current in the middle of the nineteenth century was\r\nattained--that is to say, enough to give ground for the assertion that\r\nfertilization depends upon the contact of the spermatozoon with the\r\nbody of the egg. In 1843 Martin Barry had found the spermatozoa within\r\nthe egg-envelope of the rabbit ovum, but it was some time later (1852)\r\nthat the investigations of Meissner, Bischoff, and Newport established\r\nthe fact that the zoosperm penetrates through the egg-envelope. All\r\nelse remained quite obscure, and could not be cleared up as long as it\r\nwas believed, on the strength of observations which were in themselves\r\ncorrect enough, that _several_ zoosperms were always necessary to\r\nfertilize one ovum.\r\n\r\nTo an understanding of the process even in its most general outlines\r\nthere was lacking, apart from technical methods, an appreciation of the\r\nmorphological value of the ovum and the spermatozoon. It was necessary\r\nto recognize both ovum and spermatozoon as _cells_ before their union\r\nin fertilization could be regarded as the fusion of two cells, as a\r\ncopulation or conjugation of two minute elementary organisms. But this\r\nknowledge only gained ground very gradually, and even in the sixties\r\nopinions on the subject were very much divided. Moreover, there was an\r\nentire absence of knowledge in regard to 'sexual' reproduction among\r\nthe lower plants, the Algæ, Fungi, Mosses, and Ferns, as well as of\r\nany detailed acquaintance with the processes of fertilization among\r\nflowering plants. All this had to be elucidated by the labours of many\r\ndistinguished observers before it was possible to say so much even as\r\nthis, that the process of fertilization depends in general on the union\r\nof two cells.\r\n\r\nI need not discuss the whole of this long process of scientific\r\ndevelopment, and have only touched upon it because I wished to\r\nemphasize that the conception of the process of fertilization was\r\nfor a long time quite erroneous, and has only attained to clearness\r\nin recent times. Pairing as it is seen in the higher animals was for\r\nlong regarded as the essential part of the process, and a mysterious\r\nlife-awakening influence was assumed in regard to it; and even when it\r\nwas understood that not the copulation, but the union of two living\r\nunits which was always brought about thereby--the union of the male\r\nand the female germ-cells--was the essence of 'fertilization,' this\r\nwas still regarded as a life-awakening process, and the way to a true\r\nunderstanding of the facts was thus once more blocked.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of sexual reproduction in many-celled animals\r\nis found, among others, in the Volvocineæ, those green, spherical,\r\nfreshwater cell-colonies which we have already studied in relation to\r\nreproduction by asexual germ-cells. Among them it is the rule that,\r\nafter a long series of generations producing only 'asexual' germ-cells,\r\ncolonies occur in which each germ-cell is no longer able to develop a\r\nnew colony alone, but can do so only after it has united with another\r\ngerm-cell.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have seen, there are Volvocineæ in which the differentiation\r\nof cells into those of the body (soma) and those concerned with\r\nreproduction has not been established, and all the cells are therefore\r\nalike. In these, as for instance in the genus _Pandorina_ (Fig. 62,\r\np. 257), when sexual reproduction is to occur the whole colony breaks\r\nup into sixteen cells; these burst forth from the gelatinous matrix\r\nin which they have been hitherto enclosed, swim about in the water\r\nwith the help of their two flagella, meet other similar free-swimming\r\ncells and conjugate with these. The two swimming cells come close to\r\neach other, draw in their flagella, sink to the ground in consequence,\r\nand fuse completely both as to the cell-body and the nucleus. They\r\nassume a spherical form, lose the eye-spot, become surrounded with a\r\ntough cell-skin or cyst, and so remain for a longer or shorter time as\r\nso-called 'zygotes' or lasting spores. Then they develop by repeated\r\ncell-division into one of the sixteen-celled _Pandorina_ colonies with\r\nwhich we are already familiar; this bursts forth from the capsule and\r\nswims freely about in the water again.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, the so-called sexual reproduction depends on the\r\nfusion of two cells similar in appearance, and when this phenomenon\r\nwas first known it was regarded as something quite different from the\r\ncorresponding reproduction in other multicellular organisms. But we\r\nnow know that quite nearly related Volvocineæ belonging to the genus\r\n_Volvox_ and to other genera, which exhibit a differentiation into\r\nbody-cells and reproductive cells, may reproduce sexually by means of\r\ntwo _different_ kinds of germ-cells; and we have also learned through\r\nGoebel and others that even genera like _Pandorina_, which consist of\r\nonly one kind of cells, may yet produce male and female reproductive\r\ncells differing essentially in form from one another. In _Eudorina_,\r\nfor instance, a gelatinous sphere containing sixteen or thirty-two\r\nindividual cells, asexual reproduction occurs in exactly the same way\r\nas in _Pandorina_, that is, each of these cells divides four or five\r\ntimes in rapid succession, and thus forms a new colony, which then\r\nbursts forth; but when the time for sexual reproduction comes the\r\ncolonies behave differently, for some become female and some male.\r\nIn the former the cells remain as they were before, but in the male\r\ncolonies the sixteen or thirty-two cells undergo a peculiar process\r\nof division, which ends in each becoming a mass (16-32) of so-called\r\n'zoosperms,' that is, minute, narrow, longitudinally elongated cells\r\nwith two flagella (Fig. 63 at _D_ shows those of _Volvox_). In\r\n_Eudorina_ they differ from the female germ-cells or ova externally\r\nin form and size, as well as by being much more actively motile, and\r\nthey contain green and subsequently yellow colouring matter, and a\r\nred eye-spot. We here find, for the first time among multicellular\r\norganisms, the differentiation of male and female germ-cells; and we\r\nlearn from this that the essence of fertilization does not lie in this\r\ndifferentiation, since it may be absent, but that this distinction\r\nof female and male cells is only of secondary moment. From the fact\r\nthat the egg-cells are larger and less active, the 'sperm-cells'\r\nor zoosperms smaller and livelier, we can already anticipate what\r\nwill be more definitely established as our knowledge of the facts\r\nincreases--that a differentiation according to the principle of\r\ndivision of labour has taken place even in the germ-cells, and that the\r\nfirst effect of this is to render the meeting of the cells destined for\r\nconjugation easier and more certain. The much smaller and more slender\r\nzoosperms swim about in the water in clusters until they come in\r\ncontact with a female colony; then they separate from each other, bore\r\ntheir way into the soft jelly of the female colony, and 'fertilize' the\r\negg-cell, that is to say, each male cell fuses with a female cell and\r\nforms a 'lasting spore,' exactly as in _Pandorina_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. _Volvox aureus_, after Klein and Schenck.\r\n_A_, besides the small flagellate somatic cells of the colony there\r\nare five large egg-cells (_t_) which are capable of parthenogenetic\r\ndevelopment, three recently fertilized egg-cells (_o_) and a number of\r\nmale germ-cells (_a_) in process of multiplication. From each of these,\r\nby continued division, a bundle of spermatozoa arises. _B_, a bundle\r\nof thirty-two sperm-cells in process of development, seen from above.\r\n_C_, the same seen from the side. Magnified 687 times. _D_ individual\r\nspermatozoa, magnified 824 times.]\r\n\r\nIn _Volvox_ the state of matters is similar to that in _Eudorina_;\r\nhere again, in addition to the 'asexual' reproduction through the\r\n'Parthenogonidia' which are like egg-cells in appearance (Fig. 63,\r\n_A_, _t_), there are also male and female germ-cells which are usually\r\nproduced alternately with the former, but sometimes at the same time,\r\nas in Fig. 63. The egg-cells are large and have no flagella, the\r\nsperm-cells lie together in clusters, and after they are mature (_D_)\r\nthey swim freely in the water and then bore into another colony, where\r\neach unites with an egg-cell. The difference between the two kinds of\r\ncells consists therefore in the much greater number, the much smaller\r\nsize, and the greater activity of the male cells, and in the smaller\r\nnumber but much larger size of the female cells--a differentiation\r\nin accordance with the principle of division of labour, depending on\r\nthe fact that the two kinds of cells must reach each other, and yet\r\nmust contain a certain mass of living protoplasm. While the small size\r\nbut large number of male cells, combined with their motility, gives\r\nthem an advantage in seeking out and boring into the female cells,\r\nthe large size of the latter, on the other hand, makes up for the\r\nloss in mass which the fertilized egg would otherwise suffer from the\r\ndiminution in size of the male cell. This difference in size may be\r\ngreatly accentuated; thus in one of the brown sea-wracks, for instance,\r\nthe spermatozoa are only 5 micro-millimetres in length, while the ova\r\nare spherical and have a diameter of 80-100 micro-millimetres, thus\r\ncontaining a mass 30-60,000 times greater (Möbius). Fig. 64 shows an\r\novum of this species surrounded by spermatozoa.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evolution of species this contrast between female\r\nand male germ-cells became more and more marked, not always in the same\r\ndirection, however, but in one or another according to the conditions\r\nof fertilization. It would be erroneous to suppose that, with the\r\nhigher differentiation of the organism as a whole, the differentiation\r\nof the germ-cells became increasingly complex. On the contrary we find\r\neven among Algæ, as the case of _Fucus_ shows, a marked difference\r\nbetween the sex-cells, which rather decreases than increases among many\r\nof the higher plants. It is not on the more or less complex structure\r\nof the organism itself that the nature and degree of the dimorphism\r\nof the germ-cells depends, but on the special conditions which are\r\ninvolved in each case, both in the union of the two kinds of sex-cells\r\nand in the subsequent development of the product of this union, the\r\n'fertilized ovum.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64. _Fucus platycarpus_, brown sea-wrack. _Ei_,\r\novum, surrounded by swarming sperm-cells (_sp_). After Schenck.]\r\n\r\nThus it comes about that the male or 'sperm-cells' of the lower plants,\r\nof the lower animals, and, again, of the highest animals are similar\r\nin structure. In all these organisms the male germ-cells exhibit the\r\nminuteness, the form, and the activity of the so-called 'zoosperms'\r\nor 'spermatozoa,' that is to say, they are thread-like, very minute\r\ncorpuscles, which move rapidly forwards in water or other fluid with\r\nundulatory movements, and penetrate into the ovum with similar boring\r\nmovements when they have been fortunate enough to reach their goal. At\r\nthe anterior end they possess a more or less conspicuous thickening,\r\nthe so-called 'head' in which the nucleus lies, and this is followed\r\nby the 'tail,' a thread-like structure consisting of cytoplasm which\r\neffects undulatory movements comparable to those of the flagella\r\nof Infusorians and Volvocineæ. The whole spermatozoon is thus a\r\nspecialized 'flagellate cell.'\r\n\r\nWhen these 'zoosperms' were recognized as the 'fertilizing elements' in\r\nhigher animals, and when 'sperm-threads' had been found, not only in\r\nall mammals and birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, but even in\r\nmany 'invertebrates,' the conclusion was suggested that the function\r\nof fertilization might be discharged by this lively motile substance;\r\nfor until the eighth decade of the nineteenth century fertilization was\r\nstill regarded by many as an 'awakening of life' in the egg. Since life\r\ndepends on movement, in truth on infinitely fine molecular movements,\r\nof which the movement of the whole germ-cell from place to place is\r\nonly a visible outcome, fertilization was pictured, by a not very\r\nluminous process of reasoning, as the awakening of life in the ovum--in\r\nitself incapable of further life--through the transference to it of\r\nmovement through the agency of the zoosperm. Some investigators even\r\nwent the length of regarding the ovum as 'dead organic material.'\r\n\r\nI mention this at this point, though I do not propose in the meantime\r\nto inquire further into the significance of the conjugation of the\r\nsex-cells. But the view just referred to is so completely refuted even\r\nby the external form of the male germ-cells in many groups of plants\r\nand animals, that I cannot discuss these differences in form without at\r\nthe same time indicating the conclusions which they directly suggest.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of plants and animals exhibit the zoosperm form of\r\nmale germ-cells, and this must obviously be interpreted in the light of\r\nthe fact that the ova to be fertilized are not generally to be found in\r\ndirect proximity to the sperms shed by the male organism, but are at\r\nsome distance from them. Among Medusæ and Polyps both male and female\r\ngerm-cells are liberated into the water, simultaneously it may be,\r\nbut separated from each other by distances of some feet or yards. The\r\nspermatozoa then swim about seeking the ova, which are also floating\r\nfreely in the sea, guided by a power of attraction on the part of the\r\nlatter--an attraction of whose nature we know nothing, though in the\r\ncase of certain fern-ova it has been traced to the secretion of malic\r\nacid (Pfeffer).\r\n\r\nThe same conditions obtain among Sponges. Here, again, the persons or\r\nstocks are either male or female; the latter produce large delicate\r\nova, which lie in the interior of the sponge and there await the\r\nfertilizing sperms; the former give off the ripe sperms into the water\r\nin such abundance that thousands and millions of zoosperms burst\r\nforth simultaneously in all directions; these seek about for a female\r\nsponge, penetrate into its canal system, and so ultimately reach the\r\nova. Of course only a very few of them reach their goal; the greater\r\nnumber are lost in the water and become the prey of Infusorians,\r\nRadiolarians, or other lowly animals. The fact that enormous numbers\r\nthus miss their true aim shows us why these zoosperms must be produced\r\nin such quantities; it is simply an adaptation to the extraordinarily\r\nhigh ratio of elimination in these cells, just as the number of young\r\nannually produced by an animal, or of seeds by a plant, is regulated\r\nby natural selection according to the ratio of elimination of the\r\nparticular species. The more numerous the descendants which succumb\r\neach time to unfavourable circumstances, to enemies, or to lack of\r\nfood, the more prolific must the species be. The same holds true of\r\nthe regulation of the number of male germ-cells to be produced by an\r\nindividual; there must be so many developed that, in spite of the\r\nunavoidable enormous loss, on an average the number of mature ova\r\nnecessary to the maintenance of the species always receive spermatozoa.\r\n\r\nAlso associated with the prodigal production of zoosperms is their\r\nminuteness, for the more zoosperms that can be developed out of a\r\ngiven mass of organic substance the smaller they are. Each species\r\nis restricted within definite limits of production by its size and\r\nthe volume of its body, and there is thus an advantage in having the\r\nzoosperms of the smallest possible size whenever the chance of the\r\nindividual sperm successfully reaching an ovum is very small. In all\r\nsuch cases nature has abstained from burdening the male germ-cell with\r\nan appreciable contribution of material to the result of conjugation,\r\nthat is, to the foundation of the new organism; the passive ovum\r\ncontains in itself alone almost all that is necessary to the building\r\nup of the embryo. Fertilization of the ovum by the liberation of the\r\nsperm-cells into the water occurs not only in animals of low degree,\r\nsuch as Sponges, Medusæ, Star-fishes, Sea-urchins and their relatives,\r\nbut also in much higher animals, such as many Fishes and Amphibians,\r\nand in these the male cells have the form of motile threads. But the\r\nspermatozoon-form of male cell does not occur only in animals and\r\nplants which live in the water, or in those which, like mosses and many\r\nvascular plants, are at least occasionally covered by a thin layer of\r\nrain or dew, in which the zoosperms can swim to the ova, it occurs also\r\nin a very large number of animals in which the sperms pass directly\r\ninto the body of the female, in those, therefore, in which copulation\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nBut even where copulation occurs we find that in most cases, as, for\r\ninstance, in Vertebrates, Molluscs, and Insects, the zoosperm-form\r\nis retained. The reason for this is obviously twofold: in the first\r\nplace, in many cases the sperms do not directly reach the ovum as a\r\nconsequence of copulation, but may have to go a long way within the\r\nbody of the female, as in mammals; or even when the way is short and\r\ncertain, the ovum may be encased in a firm covering or shell difficult\r\nto penetrate, and the thread-like zoosperm has to face the task of\r\nboring its way through this shell, or slipping in through a minute\r\nopening, the so-called micropyle. In either case it would be difficult\r\nto imagine a form of sperm-cell better adapted to the fulfilment of\r\nthis task than that of a thread with a thin, pointed head-portion and\r\na long motile tail, which enables the zoosperm to twist itself like a\r\nscrew through a narrow opening in the egg-envelope, whether the opening\r\nwas previously present or not.\r\n\r\nWe can thus understand why, among insects for instance, the male cells\r\nshould always occur in the form of zoosperms, although in this case\r\nthey reach a special receptacle in the female reproductive organs,\r\nthe 'receptaculum seminis,' and are stored up in this. When a mature\r\novum gliding downwards through the oviduct comes to the place where\r\nthis receptacle opens into it, the liberation of a few sperm-cells\r\nsuffices to fertilize it with certainty, provided that they possess the\r\nthread-like form, which allows them to slip in through the very minute\r\nopening in the egg-envelope. It might be inferred from the certainty\r\nwith which the ovum must in this case be found by the spermatozoon\r\nthat only a small number of the latter would require to be produced,\r\nand yet even here the number is very large, though not so enormous\r\nas in the sea-urchins and other marine animals, which simply allow\r\nthe sperm-cells to escape into the water. The large number in insects\r\nis due to the fact that many of the sperms may miss the micropyle;\r\nand also that in many insects a very large number of eggs have to be\r\nfertilized in succession. In the course of a life lasting three or\r\nfour years the queen bee lays many thousand of eggs, most of which are\r\nfertilized, and that from a seminal receptacle which has been filled\r\nonly once.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other sperm-cells of thread-like form which are\r\nnot produced in such enormous multitudes, but in a much more moderate\r\nnumber, perhaps a few hundreds in the testicle. This is so in the\r\nlittle Crustaceans, known as Ostracods, all the freshwater species of\r\nwhich possess zoosperms only moderately numerous and of quite unusual\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively small number is explained by the certainty with which\r\neach of them reaches the ovum, and the large size may be accounted\r\nfor in part by the small number which suffices, and which, therefore,\r\nadmits of the male cell also carrying a considerable portion of the\r\nmaterial for the building up of the embryo. Probably, however, the\r\nthickness and firmness of the covering of the ovum has something to\r\ndo with it, for it has no opening for the entrance of the male cell,\r\nand it is fully hardened by the time fertilization takes place.\r\nPerhaps nowhere can we see more clearly how every little detail of the\r\nstructure of the organism is dominated by the principle of adaptation\r\nthan in the arrangements for fertilization, and notably in those which\r\nobtain in the Ostracods. I pass by the complicated apparatus for\r\ncopulation, since we do not yet understand it fully in all particulars.\r\nAccording to my own investigations and those of my former students,\r\nDr. Stuhlmann and Dr. Schwarz, the essential point seems to be that\r\nthe colossally large zoosperms, which show no activity within the\r\nbody of the male, leave it one at a time, so to speak, in single\r\nfile. In copulation they are pressed out singly, one after the other,\r\nthrough a very fine tube, and then they enter, still singly, through\r\nthe reproductive aperture of the female into an equally fine passage\r\nwith spiral windings, through which they ultimately reach a roomy\r\npear-shaped receptacle, the 'receptaculum seminis' of the female. There\r\nthey lie in a long band composed of several hundreds, and only now\r\nattain their full maturity by throwing off an outer cuticle--moulting,\r\nso to speak. It is only when they get into a fluid medium that they\r\nshow the power of undulatory movement, feeble at first, but gradually\r\nmore energetic and more violent. And these movements enable them to\r\npenetrate like gimlets into the calcareous egg-shell. In the normal\r\ncourse it happens that when a mature ovum is deposited from the opening\r\nof the oviduct, one of the giant zoosperms at the same time, or shortly\r\nafterwards, leaves the 'receptaculum seminis' of the female by way of\r\nthe spiral passage, and reaches the exterior just behind the ovum. The\r\nactual process of penetration has not been observed as yet, but the\r\nzoosperm has been seen at a slightly later stage spirally coiled inside\r\nthe ovum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. Copulation in a Daphnid (Lyncæid). Emptying of\r\nthe sperm (_sp_) into the brood-chamber of the female (♀). _abd_ ♂, the\r\nabdomen of the male. Magnified 100 times.]\r\n\r\nIn these Ostracods the sperms are often visible with the naked eye, and\r\nin some species they are twice the length of the animal; they are thus\r\nemphatically giant cells, which can develop a very considerable boring\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the various adaptations of the sperm-cells to the\r\nconditions of fertilization there is hardly any group more interesting\r\nthan the water-fleas or Daphnids.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing how greatly the size of the sperms varies among the\r\nDaphnids, and how it stands in inverse proportion to their number,\r\nand how both are obviously regulated in relation to the difficulties\r\nwhich stand in the way of each sperm-cell before it can reach the ovum.\r\nIn some species the sperm-cells are very large, in others extremely\r\nsmall. In the genera _Daphnia_, _Lynceus_, and others, copulation\r\noccurs as shown in Fig. 65; the sperm-cells (_sp_) are liberated by\r\nthe male into the capacious brood-cavity of the female, which at the\r\nmoment is closed to some extent by the abdomen of the male, in reality\r\nclosed only partially at the posterior end and at the sides. It seems\r\ninevitable that a large proportion of the male elements should stream\r\nout again and be lost because of the violent movements of both animals.\r\nAccordingly, we find that the sperm-cells are only about the hundredth\r\npart of a millimetre in length and of round or rod-like form, and are\r\nvoided in multitudes into the brood-cavity. Fig. 66, _f_, _g_, and\r\n_h_, show such cells in different species, as they occur in the testes\r\nto the number of many thousands. But in all the species in which the\r\nbrood-cavity is _closed_, and in which therefore there is not such a\r\nserious loss of sperm-cells, the elements are much larger, and at the\r\nsame time less numerous. They are largest and least numerous in species\r\nof genera like _Daphnella_, _Polyphemus_, and _Bythotrephes_, in which\r\nthe males have a copulatory organ, so that the possibility of loss\r\nof the male cells is excluded. Thus the round, delicate, and viscid\r\nsperm-cells of _Bythotrephes_ (Fig. 66, _b_) are more than a tenth of a\r\nmillimetre in length, but they are developed in proportionately smaller\r\nnumbers, so that more than twenty are never found in the testis, and\r\noften only six or eight, while in copulation only from three to five\r\nare ejected. But as there are only two eggs to be fertilized at a time,\r\nand as the male cells are expressed into the brood-cavity directly upon\r\nthe eggs, so that they immediately adhere to them, this small number is\r\namply sufficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66. Spermatozoa of various Daphnids. _a, Sida._\r\n_b, Bythotrephes._ _c, Daphnella._ _d, Moina paradoxa._ _e, Moina\r\nrectirostris._ _f, Eurycercus lamellatus._ _g, Alonella pygmæa._ _h,\r\nPeracantha truncata._ All magnified 300 times.]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how different the sperm-cells sometimes are in quite\r\nnearly related species of Daphnids, as a glance at Fig. 66 will show;\r\nand, on the other hand, how similar they may be in two species which\r\nbelong to different families, like _Bythotrephes longimanus_ (_b_),\r\nand _Daphnella hyalina_ (_c_). The last fact may be explained as an\r\nadaptation to similar conditions of fertilization. Both species have\r\neffective copulatory organs, and their large delicate sperm-cells must\r\nimmediately adhere when they come into contact with the shell-less\r\novum, and penetrate into it by means of amœboid processes. Conversely,\r\nthe difference between sperm-cells of allied species like _Sida\r\ncrystallina_ (_a_), _Moina rectirostris_ (_e_) and _M. paradoxa_ (_d_)\r\nis related to different adaptations to nearly the same conditions of\r\nfertilization. In _Sida_ (Fig. 66 _a_) the large flat sperm-cells, with\r\ntheir fringed ends and their large soft surface, adhere easily to the\r\nova, and the same end is attained in _Moina rectirostris_ by means of\r\nstiff radiating processes, while in the nearly related species, _Moina\r\nparadoxa_, the male cell (_d_) resembles an Australian boomerang and\r\npresses in like a wedge between the ova and the wall of the brood-sac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.

Much magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 67 a small selection of animal male cells is figured, all of\r\nwhich take the form of sperm-threads or spermatozoa, and yet they\r\ndiffer very much from one another in detail. It would undoubtedly\r\nbe of great interest to follow out these minute adaptations of the\r\nsperm-cells to the conditions of fertilization, and to demonstrate\r\nthat their size, and especially their form, in the different species\r\nof animals are adjusted to the special constitution of the ovum, its\r\nenvelope, and its micropyles, and to the ease or difficulty with which\r\nit can be reached; but much information must be forthcoming before we\r\ncan even suggest, for instance, why the sperm-cell of the salamander\r\nis so enormously long, large, and pointed at the head, while that of\r\nMan (Fig. 67, 1) is comparatively short, with broad, flat head and a\r\nrecently discovered minute apex; or why those of Man and many fishes\r\n(such as _Cobitis_) should be so much alike, and so on. From many\r\nsides, however, we are led to conclude that even down to the minutest\r\ndetails nothing is in vain, and that everything depends on adaptation.\r\n\r\nIn general, even the peculiarities of form already indicate this; thus\r\nthe spirally coiled structure of the head, which is especially well\r\ndeveloped in the spermatozoa of birds (Fig. 67, 5), in those of the\r\nskate (7), and of the freshwater snail (_Paludina_) (10), works like a\r\ncorkscrew, and makes it possible for the spermatozoon to pierce through\r\nthe resistant envelope of the ovum. Similarly, the sharply pointed head\r\nof the insect spermatozoon (Fig. 67, 8 & 9) seems adapted for slipping\r\nthrough the minute pre-formed micropyle in the hard egg-shell.\r\n\r\nOf the detailed and complicated structure of spermatozoa we have only\r\nrecently been made aware through the increasing perfection of the\r\nmicroscope and of technical methods of investigation. Fig. 68 shows\r\none after a diagrammatic figure by Wilson. We see the apical point\r\n(_sp_) for boring into the ovum, the nucleus (_n_) surrounded by a thin\r\nlayer of protoplasm, which together form the head, then the middle\r\nportion (_m_) which contains the 'centrosome' (_c_), and the 'tail' or\r\n'flagellum' which effects the movement of the whole and which itself\r\npossesses a complex structure with an 'axial filament' (_ax_) and an\r\nenveloping layer, the latter often drawn out into a spirally twisted,\r\nundulating membrane of the most extreme delicacy, as is most clearly\r\nseen in the newt (Fig. 67, 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. Diagram of a spermatozoon, after Wilson. _sp_,\r\napical point. _n_, nucleus. _c_, centrospere. _m_, middle piece. _ax_,\r\naxial filament. _e_, terminal filament.]\r\n\r\nNot in the Daphnids alone, but in other groups of Crustaceans as\r\nwell, sperm-cells of quite peculiar form occur, as, for instance, in\r\nthe crayfish and its marine relatives, the crabs and the long-tailed\r\nDecapods. In these cases the spermatozoa bear long and stiff thorn-like\r\nprocesses, which, as in the sperm-cells of _Moina_, make them adhesive,\r\nand, according to Brandes, render it possible for them to cling among\r\nthe bristles on the abdomen of the female until one of the many eggs\r\nleaving the oviduct comes within reach. For among these Crustacea\r\nthere is no true copulation, but the masses of sperm-cells are packed\r\ntogether into sperm-packets or 'spermatophores,' and are affixed by the\r\nmale near the opening of the oviduct, where they burst and pour forth\r\ntheir contents between the appendages of the female.\r\n\r\nAll these remarkable and widely divergent structures and arrangements\r\ndepend not upon chance or on the fantastic expression of a 'formative\r\npower,' as an earlier generation was wont to phrase it; they are\r\nundoubtedly without exception adaptations to the most intimate\r\nconditions of fertilization in each individual case. I lay particular\r\nstress upon a recognition of this, because it permits us to infer with\r\ncertainty that even the variations of the single cell, if they are\r\nsufficiently important for the species, may be controlled by natural\r\nselection. It is obvious that the adaptations of the sex-cells must\r\ndepend not on histonal selection, but only upon personal selection,\r\nsince it is indifferent for the individual sperm-cells whether\r\nfertilization is accomplished successfully or not, while it is by\r\nno means indifferent for the species. The organism dies without\r\ndescendants if its sperm-cells do not fertilize, and the carrying on\r\nof the species must be left to those of its fellows which produced\r\nsperm-cells which fertilize with more certainty; thus it is not\r\nthe sperm-cells themselves, but the individual organisms which are\r\nselected, and that in relation to the quality of the sex-cells they\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the great diversity of form exhibited by the\r\nspermatozoa, the differentiation of the ovum appears very uniform,\r\nat least in regard to form and activity. The main form is spherical,\r\nbut it is subject to many variations in the way of elongation or\r\nflattening. In the lower forms of life, as, for instance, among the\r\nsponges, and also in the polyps and Medusæ the egg-cells possess, until\r\nthey are mature, the locomotor capacity of unicellular organisms;\r\nthey creep about after the manner of amœbæ, and indeed, as I showed\r\nyears ago, this movement from place to place in many polyps is exactly\r\nregulated; thus at a definite time they may leave the place where they\r\noriginated and may, for instance, creep from the outer layer of cells\r\n(ectoderm) of the animal into the inner layer (endoderm) by boring\r\nthrough the so-called 'supporting lamella,' then they may creep further\r\nin the endoderm, and finally return to quite definite and often remote\r\nspots in the ectoderm (_Eudendrium_, Fig. 95). In another hydroid polyp\r\n(_Corydendrium parasiticum_) the mature egg-cells leave their former\r\nposition within the endoderm and creep entirely outside of the animal\r\nwhich produced them, establishing themselves in a definite spot on its\r\nexternal surface, where they await the fertilizing zoosperms. Many ova\r\ncan accomplish slight amœboid movements, but in most animals these\r\ndo not suffice for movement from place to place, and the ova remain\r\nquietly in the spot where they were developed, or are passively pushed\r\nto another. Cases such as that of the polyp I have cited, in which the\r\novum actually comes to meet the male element, are quite exceptional,\r\nfor in general the ovum is the passive and the spermatozoon the active\r\nor exploring element in fertilization. The female cell is entrusted\r\nwith procuring and storing the material necessary to the building up of\r\nthe embryo; and its peculiarities depend chiefly on this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. Ovum of the Sea-urchin, _Toxopneustes lividus_,\r\nafter Wilson. _zk_, cell-body. _k_, nucleus or so-called 'germinal\r\nvesicle,' _n_, nucleolus or so-called 'germinal spot.' Below there is\r\na spermatozoon of the same animal, with the same magnification (750\r\ntimes).]\r\n\r\nIt is true that in plants this stored material is seldom considerable,\r\nand that is because the ovum so frequently remains even after\r\nfertilization within the living tissues of the plant, and is thence\r\nsupplied, often very abundantly, with food-stuffs; and, moreover,\r\nbecause the young plant that springs from the fertilized ovum maybe\r\nvery small and simple, and yet capable of immediately procuring its\r\nown nourishment. But there are exceptions to this; thus the ova of the\r\nbrown sea-wracks, or Fucaceæ, for instance, are quite twenty times\r\nas large as the ordinary cells of the algæ (Fig. 64), and contain a\r\nquantity of food-stuff within themselves. In this case the ova are\r\nliberated into the water even before fertilization, and the nutrition\r\nof the embryo from the mother-plant is excluded.\r\n\r\nIn these Algæ we meet, for the first time, with a special organ in\r\nwhich the ova arise. In animals this is much more generally the case,\r\nand from sponges upwards there are always quite definite parts and\r\ntissues of the body which are alone able to develop eggs, and these\r\nare usually well-defined organs of special structure, the ovaries.\r\nSimilarly, in male animals the spermatozoa arise in special places, and\r\nusually in special organs, the spermaries or testes.\r\n\r\nAnimal ova often consist of more than the simple cell-body, the\r\nprotoplasm and its nucleus; they almost always contain in the cell-body\r\na so-called 'Deutoplasm,' as Van Beneden has fittingly named the\r\nyolk-substance. This consists of fats, carbohydrates, or albuminoids,\r\nwhich often lie in the cell-body in the form of spherules, flakes, or\r\ngrains--a nutritive material that is often surrounded and enclosed\r\nby a small quantity of living matter or formative protoplasm. Apart\r\nfrom these stores of yolk it would be impossible for a young animal\r\nto develop from the ovum of a snake or a bird, for such highly\r\ndifferentiated animals could not be formed from an egg of microscopic\r\ndimensions if this remained without some supply of food from outside of\r\nitself during the period of development. There is obviously need for a\r\nconsiderable amount of building material, so that all the organs and\r\nparts, which are composed of thousands and millions of cells, may be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThus the size of the animal-ovum depends essentially on the quantity of\r\nyolk that has to be supplied to the egg, and this depends in the main\r\non whether the egg is still drawing nourishment from the mother during\r\nthe development of the young animal. Therefore, as a general rule,\r\neggs which are laid, and are surrounded and protected by a shell, are\r\nusually much larger than the eggs of animals which go through their\r\ndevelopment within the body of the mother. The best known illustration\r\nof this proposition is offered by mammals and birds, animals of equally\r\nhigh organization and comparable in bodily size. While the eggs of\r\nbirds may be as much as 15 centimetres in length, and may weigh 1½\r\nkilogrammes, those of most mammals remain microscopically minute, and\r\nscarcely exceed a length of 0.3 millimetres. The same principle is\r\noften illustrated within one and the same small group of animals, and\r\neven in the same species. Here, again, the Daphnids or water-fleas may\r\nserve as an example.\r\n\r\nAmong these there are two kinds of eggs, summer and winter eggs, of\r\nwhich the former go through their development into a young animal\r\nwithin a brood-cavity on the back of the female, while the others are\r\nliberated into the water, and are surrounded by a hard shell. The\r\nsummer eggs receive more or less nourishment from the mother by the\r\nextravasation of the nutritive constituents of the blood into the\r\nbrood-cavity, and they thus require a smaller provision of yolk than\r\nthe winter eggs, which are thrown entirely upon their own resources.\r\nAccordingly we find that in all Daphnids the summer eggs are at least\r\na little smaller and have less yolk than the winter eggs, as in the\r\ngenus _Daphnella_ (Fig. 70, _A_ and _B_), while in some species, e.g.\r\nof _Bythotrephes_, this difference increases so much that the summer\r\neggs are almost without yolk, and therefore very minute (Fig. 71, _B_).\r\nThe reason of this lies in the fact that in this case the brood-sac\r\nis filled with a nutritive fluid rich in albuminoid substances, so\r\nthat the embryo during its development is continually supplied with\r\nconcentrated nourishment. This is not the case with the winter eggs,\r\nbecause these are liberated into the water, and we therefore find that\r\nthey are of enormous size and quite filled with yolk (Fig. 71, _A_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70. _Daphnella._ _A_, summer egg. _B_, winter egg.\r\n_Oe_, 'oil-globules' of the summer egg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71. _Bythotrephes longimanus._ _A_, the brood-sac\r\n(_Br_) of the female containing two winter-ova (_Wei_), on which\r\nfive large sperm-cells (_sp_) are lying. _R_, dorsal surface of the\r\nanimal. _Dr_, glandular layer which secretes the shell-substance. _BK_,\r\ncopulatory canal. _B_, the brood-sac (_Br_) containing two summer-ova\r\n(_Sei_). Both figures under the same magnification (100).]\r\n\r\nIn this instance, as in all the simpler eggs, the yolk constituents\r\nare secretions of the cell-body of the ovum; but nature employs many\r\ndevices, if I may so speak, to bring up the mass of the egg, and\r\nespecially of the yolk, to the highest attainable point. Thus in many\r\norders of Crustaceans, for instance in the water-fleas just mentioned,\r\nthere are special egg-nourishing cells, that is, young ovum-cells\r\nwhich do not differ from the rest either in origin or in appearance,\r\nonly they do not become mature eggs, but at a definite time cease to\r\nmake progress, and then slowly break up, so that their substance may\r\nbe absorbed as food by the true ova. Thus there is a much greater and\r\nat the same time more rapid growth than could be attained through\r\nnourishment from the blood alone. In the Daphnids the ovaries consist\r\nof groups of four cells each, only one of which becomes an ovum (Fig.\r\n72, _Ei_), while the other three (1, 2, and 4) form nutritive cells\r\nwhich break up. This is so in all summer eggs; but in the winter eggs\r\na much larger number of nutritive cells may take part in equipping a\r\nsingle ovum, and in the genus _Moina_ over forty do so. But here the\r\ndifference in size between the two kinds of eggs is very marked, the\r\nwinter eggs being twice the diameter of the summer eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72. _Sida crystallina_, a Daphnid: a fragment of\r\nthe ovary showing one of the groups of four cells, of which 1, 2, and 4\r\nare nutritive cells, and only 3 becomes an ovum. Magnified 300 times.]\r\n\r\nIn many insects also, e.g. in beetles and bees, similar nutritive cells\r\noccur, but there is in these forms a different arrangement which serves\r\nat the same time for the formation of the shell, and the supplying to\r\nthe ovum of the necessary yolk-stuffs--the ovum is surrounded with a\r\ndense layer of epithelial cells, a so-called 'follicle.' In mammals and\r\nbirds also these 'follicle cells' certainly play an important part in\r\nthe nutrition of the ovum, though it is not yet quite clear how they\r\nact--whether they produce within themselves grains of yolk and other\r\nnutritive substances and convey these to the ovum by means of fine\r\nradiating processes, or whether they themselves ultimately migrate into\r\nthe ovum and there break up. In any case it is worthy of note that\r\nall these follicular cells in insects and vertebrates have the same\r\norigin as the egg-cells, that is, they are modified germ-cells. The\r\ncase is therefore essentially the same as in the nutritive cells of the\r\nDaphnids; nature sacrifices the greater number of the germ-cells in\r\norder to be able to provide more abundantly for the minority. She thus\r\nsucceeds in raising the egg beyond itself, so to speak, and provides\r\nthe means for a growth which could obviously not be attained by means\r\nof the ordinary nourishment supplied by the blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73. Diagrammatic longitudinal section of a hen's\r\negg before incubation, after Allen Thomson. _Bl_, germinal disk. _GD_,\r\nyellow yolk. _WD_, white yolk. _DM_, vitelline membrane. _EW_, albumen.\r\n_Ch_, chalaza. _S_, shell membrane. _KS_, shell. _LR_, air chamber.]\r\n\r\nWe now understand why the eggs of many animals should be of such\r\nenormous size and often of such complex structure. The eggs of birds\r\nare especially remarkable in this respect, and it has till recently\r\nbeen disputed whether they are really morphologically equivalent to\r\na single cell. But this is undoubtedly the case, and though only the\r\nsmall thin germinal disk (Fig. 73, _Bl_) with its nucleus is the active\r\npart of this cell--the cell-body proper--yet all the rest--the enormous\r\nsphere of yolk with its regular layers of yellow (_GD_) and white\r\n(_WD_) yolk, the concentric layers of fluid albumen (_EW_) round about\r\nthis, the chalazæ (_Ch_), and finally, the delicate shell membrane\r\n(_S_) and the limy shell (_KS_)--belong to this cell, and have arisen\r\nin connexion with it (Fig. 73).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XV\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF FERTILIZATION\r\n\r\n Cell-division and nuclear division--The chromatin as the material\r\n basis of inheritance--The rôle of the centrosphere in the mechanism\r\n of division--The Chromosomes--Fertilization of the egg of the\r\n sea-urchin according to Hertwig--Of the egg of Ascaris according\r\n to Van Beneden--The directive divisions, or the extrusion of the\r\n polar bodies--Halving of the number of chromosomes--The same in\r\n the sperm-cell--Reducing division in parthenogenetic eggs--In\r\n the bee--Exceptional and artificial parthenogenesis--Rôle of the\r\n centrosphere in fertilization and in parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW that we have made ourselves acquainted with the two kinds of\r\ngerm-cells on the union of which 'sexual reproduction' depends, we may\r\nproceed to a more detailed discussion of the process of fertilization\r\nitself. But it is indispensable that we should take account of the\r\nprocesses of nuclear and cell-division, as these have been gradually\r\nrecognized and understood in the course of the last decade. It may\r\nappear strange that the processes of division should throw light on the\r\napparently opposite processes of cell-union, but it is the case, and\r\nno understanding of the latter is possible without a knowledge of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the discovery of the cell until well on in the sixties\r\nthe process of cell-division was looked on as a perfectly simple\r\nprocess, as a mere constriction in the middle of the cell. It was\r\nobserved that a cell in the act of dividing (Fig. 59, _A_) stretched\r\nitself out, that its nucleus also became longer, became thinner in the\r\nmiddle, assumed a dumb-bell form, and was then gradually constricted,\r\ngiving rise to two nuclei (_B_), whereupon the body of the cell also\r\nconstricted and the two daughter-cells were formed (_C_). In certain\r\nworn-out or highly differentiated cells a cell-division of this kind\r\nreally seems to occur--the so-called 'direct' division--but in young\r\ncells, and indeed in all vigorous cells, the process, which looks\r\nsimple, is, in reality, exceedingly complex. Not only is the structure\r\nof the nucleus incomparably more complex than was recognized a quarter\r\nof a century ago, but nature has placed within the cell a special and\r\nmarvellously intricate apparatus, by means of which the component parts\r\nof the nucleus are divided between the two daughter-nuclei.\r\n\r\nFor a long time all that was distinguished in the cell-nucleus was\r\nthe nuclear membrane and a fluid content in which one or more nuclear\r\nbodies or nucleoli float. But this does not by any means exhaust\r\nwhat can now be recognized in the structure of the nucleus, and the\r\nmost important constituents are not even among these, for recent\r\nresearches, especially those of Häcker, have shown that the nucleolus\r\nor the nucleoli, to which there was formerly an inclination to attach\r\na very high importance, must be regarded as only transient formations\r\nand not living elements--in fact, as mere collections of organic\r\nsubstance--'bye-products of the metabolism,' which at a definite time,\r\nthat is just before the division of the nucleus, disappear from the\r\nnuclear space and are used up. We now know that in the resting cell,\r\nthat is, in the cell which is not in the act of dividing (Fig. 74,\r\n_A_), a very fine network of pale threads, often very difficult to\r\nmake visible, fills the whole nuclear cavity, like a spider's web or\r\nthe finest soap bubbles, and that in this so-called nuclear framework\r\nthere are embedded granules of rounded or angular form (_A_, _chr_)\r\nwhich consist of a substance which stains deeply with such pigments as\r\ncarmine, hæmatoxylin, all aniline dyes, &c., and which has therefore\r\nreceived the name of chromatin. Often, indeed generally, these granules\r\nare exceedingly small, but sometimes they are bigger, and in that case\r\nthey are less numerous and more easily made visible; in all cases,\r\nhowever, they are in a certain sense the most important part of the\r\nnucleus, for we must assume that it is their influence which determines\r\nthe nature of the cell, which, so to speak, impresses it with the\r\nspecific stamp, and makes the young cell a muscle-cell or a nerve-cell,\r\nwhich even gives the germ-cell the power of producing, by continued\r\nmultiplication through division, a whole multicellular organism of a\r\nparticular structure and definite differentiation, in short, a new\r\nindividual of the particular species to which the parents belong. We\r\ncall the substance of which these chromatin granules consist by the\r\nname first introduced into science by Nägeli, though only to designate\r\na postulated substance which had not at that time been observed,\r\nbut which he imagined to be contained within the cell-body--by the\r\nname _Idioplasm_, that is to say, a living substance determining the\r\nindividual nature (εἶδος = form). I am anticipating here, and I reserve\r\na more detailed explanation until I can gradually bring together all\r\nthe facts which justify the conception I have just indicated of the\r\n'chromatin grains' as an 'idioplasm,' or, as we may also call it, a\r\n'hereditary substance.'\r\n\r\nThat this chromatin must be something quite special we see from the\r\nprocesses of cell and nuclear division, which I shall now briefly\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74. Diagram of nuclear division, adapted from E.\r\nB. Wilson. _A_, resting cell with cell-substance (_zk_), centrosphere\r\n(_csph_) which contains two centrosomes, nucleolus (_kk_); and\r\nchromosomes (_chr_), the last distributed in the nuclear reticulum.\r\n_B_, the chromatin united in a coiled thread; the centrosphere divided\r\ninto two and giving off rays which unite the halves. _C_, the nuclear\r\nspindle (_ksp_) formed, the rays more strongly developed, the nuclear\r\nmembrane (_km_) in process of dissolution, the chromatin thread\r\ndivided into eight similar pieces (_chrs_), the rays are attaching\r\nthemselves to the chromosomes. _D_, perfected nuclear spindle with\r\nthe two centrospheres at the poles (_csph_) and the eight chromosomes\r\n(_chrs_) in the equator of the spindle, all now longitudinally split.\r\n_E_, daughter-chromosomes diverging from one another, but still united\r\nby filaments, the centrosomes (_cs_) are already doubled for the next\r\ndivision. _F_, daughter-chromosomes, quite separated from one another,\r\nare already beginning to give off processes; the cell-substance is\r\nbeginning to be constricted. _G_, end of the process of division:\r\ntwo daughter-cells (_tz_) with similar nuclear reticulum (_tk_) and\r\ncentrospheres (_csph_), as in _A_.]\r\n\r\nWhen a cell is on the eve of dividing we observe first that the\r\nchromatin grains, which have till then been scattered throughout the\r\nnetwork of the nucleus, approach each other and arrange themselves\r\ninto a long thin thread which, irregularly intertwined, forms a loose\r\nskein, the so-called coil-stage (Fig. 74, _B_). The thread then begins\r\nto thicken, and somewhat later it can be seen to have broken up into\r\na number of pieces of equal length, as if it had been cut into equal\r\npieces with scissors (_C_).\r\n\r\nThese pieces or chromosomes become shorter by slowly contracting,\r\nand thus each takes the form of an angular loop, a straight rod, or\r\na roundish, oval, or spherical body (Fig. 74, _C_, _chrs_). While\r\nthis is happening, we can see at the side of the nucleus, and closely\r\napposed to it, a pale longitudinally striped figure with a swelling,\r\nsimilar to a handle, at both ends--the so-called nuclear spindle or\r\ncentral spindle (_ksp_). This is the apparatus for the division of the\r\nnucleus, and it was previously represented by a small body susceptible\r\nto certain stains--the centrosome, which was surrounded by a halo-like\r\nzone, the centrosphere or 'sphere.' This body was long overlooked,\r\nbut now the majority of investigators assume that, though it is often\r\ninconspicuous and very difficult to make visible, it is nevertheless\r\npresent in every cell which is capable of division, and that it is\r\ntherefore a permanent and indispensable constituent of the cell (Fig.\r\n74, _A_ and _B_, _csph_).\r\n\r\nWhen a cell is on the point of dividing, this remarkable cell-organ,\r\nwhich has hitherto seemed no more than an insignificant, pale, little\r\nsphere, now becomes active. First of all, often before the formation\r\nof the chromatin coil, it doubles by division (_A_ and _B_ _csph_), at\r\nfirst only as regards the centrosome, and then as regards the sphere\r\nalso (_B_); and while division is going on fine protoplasmic filaments\r\nissue from the dividing sphere and radiate like rays from a sun into\r\nthe cell-substance. As they only retain their connexion with each other\r\nat the surfaces of the dividing halves of the sphere which are turned\r\ntowards each other, we might almost say that fine threads are drawn out\r\nbetween the two halves as they separate, and these become longer the\r\nfurther apart the halves diverge. In this manner the much-talked-of\r\n'spindle figure' arises, which was first described in the seventies\r\nthrough the researches of A. Schneider, Auerbach, and Bütschli, but the\r\nsignificance and origin of which have claimed the labours of many later\r\ninvestigators down to our own day.\r\n\r\nThe processes now to be described do not always take place in exactly\r\nthe same manner, but the gist of the business is everywhere the same,\r\nand it consists in this, that the two ends or 'poles' of the spindle\r\ndiverge further and further apart, and between them lies the nucleus\r\nwhose membrane now disappears (_C_, _km_) while the spindle threads\r\ntraverse its interior. Sometimes the membrane is retained, but\r\nnevertheless the spindle threads penetrate into the interior of the\r\nnucleus. But the chromosomes always range themselves quite regularly\r\nin the 'equatorial plane' of the spindle (_D_, _aeq_)--a process the\r\nprecise mechanism of which is by no means clearly understood, and\r\nindeed the play of the forces in the whole process of nuclear division\r\nis still very imperfectly revealed to our intelligence.\r\n\r\nThus we have now before us a pale, spindle-shaped figure, which takes\r\nonly a faint stain, with the 'suns' (_cs_) at its 'poles,' and in its\r\nequatorial plane the loop- or rod-shaped, or spherical chromosomes\r\n(_chrs_). The whole is designated the 'karyokinetic,' the 'mitotic,' or\r\nthe 'nuclear division figure.'\r\n\r\nThe meaning and importance of this, at first sight, puzzling figure\r\nwill at once become clear from what follows. It may be observed at this\r\nstage, if not even long before, that each of the chromatin rods or\r\nloops has split along its whole length like a log of wood, and that the\r\nsplit halves are beginning slowly and hardly noticeably to move away\r\nfrom each other, one half towards one, the other towards the other pole\r\nof the spindle (Fig. _D_ and _F_). Directly in front of the centrosome\r\nthey make a halt, and now the material for the two daughter-nuclei\r\nis in its proper place (_F_, _chrs_). These develop quickly, each\r\nchromosome group surrounding itself with a nuclear membrane (Fig.\r\n_G_) within which the chromosomes gradually become transformed again\r\ninto a nuclear network. Within the chromatin substance proper this is\r\nscattered about in small roundish or angular granules, lying especially\r\nat the intersecting points of the network. It may be stated at once,\r\nthough the full significance of the statement can only be appreciated\r\nlater, that we may assume with probability that this breaking up of the\r\nchromosomes is only apparent, and that these rods or spheres really\r\ncontinue to exist in the nuclear network, only in a different form,\r\ngreatly spread out, somewhat after the manner of a Rhizopod which\r\nstretches out fine processes in all directions. These processes branch\r\nand anastomose, so that the body, which previously seemed compact,\r\nnow appears as a fine network. In point of fact, it can be directly\r\nobserved that the chromosomes, after the nucleus is completely divided\r\ninto two daughter-nuclei, send out pointed processes (_F_ and _G_)\r\nwhich gradually increase in length and branch, while the body of the\r\nchromosome itself becomes gradually smaller. It is thus probable\r\nthat, when such a daughter-nucleus is on the point of dividing anew,\r\nit may, by a drawing together of the processes or pseudopodia of the\r\nchromosomes, produce the same rods or spheres as those which previously\r\ngave rise to the network. More definite reasons for this interpretation\r\nwill be adduced later on. In any case, the chromosomes, even in\r\ntheir compact rod-like state, consist of two kinds of substance,\r\nthe chromatin proper, which stains deeply, and the linin, which is\r\ndifficult to stain; and it is the latter which, by breaking up, forms\r\nthe pale part of the nuclear network.\r\n\r\nThus we can understand that the number of chromosomes remains the same\r\nin every cell-generation throughout development, as it is the same\r\nin all the individuals of a species. The numbers are known for many\r\nspecies: in some worms there are only two or four chromosomes, while\r\nin other related worms there are eight; in the grasshopper there are\r\ntwelve, and in a marine worm, _Sagitta_, eighteen; in the mouse, the\r\ntrout, and the lily there are twenty-four; in some snails thirty-two;\r\nin the sharks thirty-six, and in _Artemia_, a little salt-water\r\ncrustacean, 168 chromosomes. In Man the chromosomes are so small that\r\ntheir normal number is not certain--sixteen have been counted. This\r\ncounting can only be done during the process of nuclear division, for\r\nafterwards the chromosomes flow indistinguishably together, or rather\r\napart, only to reappear, however, in the old form and number whenever\r\nthe nucleus again begins to divide.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be told what becomes of the centrosphere in\r\ncell-division. As soon as the formation of the daughter-nuclei has\r\nbeen brought about by the divergence of the split halves of the loops,\r\nthe spindle figure begins to retrograde, its threads become pale and\r\ngradually disappear, as does the whole radiate halo of the centrosphere\r\n(Fig. _F_ and _G_). The cell-body has by this time also divided in the\r\nequatorial plane of the nuclear spindle, and the centrosome remains\r\nusually as a very inconspicuous pale body lying in the cytoplasm close\r\nto the nucleus, reawakening to renewed activity when cell-division is\r\nabout to recommence (_G_, _csph_).\r\n\r\nThese, briefly, are the remarkable processes of nuclear division. Their\r\nnet result is obvious; the chromatin substance is divided between the\r\ndaughter-nuclei with the greatest conceivable accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy to understand the mechanism of this partition, and\r\nthere are various divergent theories on this point. According to the\r\nolder idea of Van Beneden, the spindle fibres work like muscles, and\r\nby contracting draw the halves of the chromosomes which adhere to them\r\ntowards the pole, while the rest of the fibres radiating out from\r\nthe polar corpuscles act as resisting and supporting elements. This\r\nview, with many modifications however, has still its champions, and M.\r\nHeidenhain in particular has made a notable attempt to establish it\r\nand to work it out in detail. Opposed to it stand the views of those\r\nwho, like O. Hertwig, Bütschli, Häcker, and others regard the rays not\r\nas specific elements which were pre-formed in the cell, but as the\r\nexpression of the orientation of certain protoplasmic particles--an\r\norientation evoked by forces which have their seat within the central\r\ncorpuscles, and act in the manner of magnetic or electric forces. That\r\nthe central corpuscles are centres of attraction seems to me hardly\r\nopen to doubt, and I cannot regard the regular arrangement of the\r\nchromosomes in the equatorial plane of the spindle as due to a mere\r\nadhesion to contractile threads. Some still unknown forces--chemotactic\r\nor otherwise--must be at work here. Later on we shall study the\r\nphenomenon of the migration of the sperm-nucleus into the ovum, when it\r\nis accompanied by its central body and its halo of rays. Häcker seems\r\nto me justified in inferring from this phenomenon alone that the sudden\r\norigin of the rays is due to forces resident in the central corpuscle.\r\nBut undoubtedly even this 'dynamic' explanation of karyokinesis is\r\nstill only at the stage of hypothesis and reasoning from analogy, and\r\nis far removed from a definite knowledge of the forces at work.\r\n\r\nFor the problems with which we are here chiefly concerned, the problems\r\nof heredity, it is enough to know that the cells of multicellular\r\norganisms possess an extremely complex apparatus for division, whose\r\nchief importance lies in the fact that through it the chromatin units\r\nof the nucleus are divided into precisely equal parts, and so separated\r\nfrom each other that one half forms one daughter-nucleus, the other\r\nhalf the other. It is not merely that there is an exact division of the\r\nwhole chromatin in the mass, which could have been effected much more\r\nsimply, but that there is _a regulated distribution of the different\r\nqualities of the chromatin_, as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nIt must here be emphasized that the splitting of the chromosomes does\r\nnot depend on external forces, but on internal ones involved in their\r\norganization, and in the definite attractions and repulsions of their\r\ncomponent particles which come about in the course of growth. The\r\nchromosomes do not split like a trunk that has been broken open with\r\nan axe, but rather like a tree burst apart by the frost, that is, by\r\nthe freezing of the water within itself. I consider it very important\r\nthat we should recognize this, even though we do not yet know what\r\nthe forces are that have control in this case, because it leads us to\r\nconclude that the structure of the chromosomes is extremely complex,\r\nthat they are, so to speak, a world in themselves, that they possess an\r\ninfinitely complex and delicate though invisible organization, in which\r\nintrinsic chemico-physical forces produce the regulated succession\r\nof changes which we observe. We shall afterwards see that we are led\r\nto the same conclusion from another direction--that is, from the\r\nphenomena of inheritance. We shall then recognize that the rod- or\r\nloop-shaped chromosomes cannot be simple elements, but are composed\r\nof linear series of 10, 20, or more globular single-chromosomes, each\r\nof which represents a particular kind of chromatin or hereditary\r\nsubstance. If we consider this carefully, we shall see that it would\r\nhardly be possible to think out a mode of nuclear division which would\r\nso exactly and securely fulfil the purpose of conveying these many\r\nkinds of chromatin to the two daughter-nuclei in like proportions as\r\ndoes the mechanism of distribution actually brought about by nature.\r\nThe longitudinal splitting of the rods halves the chromosomes, and the\r\nspindle apparatus secures the proper distribution of the halves between\r\nthe two daughter-nuclei.\r\n\r\nSo much, at least, is certain, that no such complicated mechanism for\r\n'mitotic' division would have arisen if the very precise division of\r\na substance _of the highest importance_ had not been concerned, and\r\nin this conclusion lies the first hint of the interpretation of the\r\nchromatin substance as the bearer of the hereditary qualities.\r\n\r\nWe are now familiar with the cell-nucleus and the apparatus for\r\nits division, and we are thus fully prepared to begin the study of\r\nthe phenomena of 'fertilization.' Here also the processes depend\r\nessentially on the behaviour of the cell-nuclei, for even the first\r\nobservations made by O. Hertwig on the behaviour of the spermatozoon\r\nafter it has penetrated into the ovum led to the suggestion that the\r\nessential fact is the union of two nuclei; and numerous later, more and\r\nmore deeply penetrating researches have furnished abundant evidence\r\nthat the so-called 'fertilization' _is essentially a nuclear fusion_.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with O. Hertwig's observations on the ovum of the\r\nsea-urchin. Eggs of this animal, which have been taken out of the ovary\r\nof the female, may easily be fertilized artificially by pouring over\r\nthem spermatic fluid taken from a male, and diluted with sea-water.\r\nBefore this is done only one nucleus can be observed in the ovum, but\r\nshortly afterwards two nucleus-like structures of unequal size can\r\nbe seen within the ovum, and the smaller is surrounded by a circle\r\nof rays. Hertwig rightly interpreted this smaller nucleus as the\r\nmodified remains of the penetrating spermatozoon, which then slowly\r\napproaches the nucleus of the egg, and ultimately fuses with it to form\r\na 'segmentation nucleus.' From this starts the so-called 'segmentation'\r\nof the ovum, that is, the series of repeated divisions resulting in the\r\nformation of an ordered mass of cells, which by continued division of\r\ncells builds up the embryo.\r\n\r\nSimple as this process of nuclear conjugation may seem, it was by no\r\nmeans so easy to recognize, and several investigators, especially\r\nAuerbach, Schneider, and Bütschli, had seen stages of the process at\r\nan earlier date without arriving at the true interpretation of the\r\nphenomena. This was chiefly due to the fact that, in addition to the\r\nphenomena of fertilization proper, which we have briefly sketched,\r\nother nuclear changes take place in the maturing ovum, and these are\r\nnot very easy to distinguish from the former; we refer to the phenomena\r\nof the so-called 'maturation of the ovum.' When the ovum-cell has\r\nattained its full size within the ovary it is not yet capable of being\r\nfertilized, but must first undergo two processes of division, to the\r\nright understanding of which Hertwig's investigations, and afterwards\r\nthose of Fol, have contributed much.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it had been a familiar observation that small\r\nrefractive corpuscles were extruded from one pole of the ovum shortly\r\nbefore the beginning of embryonic development. These were called 'polar\r\nbodies,' because it was believed that they marked the place which would\r\nafterwards be intersected by the first plane of division; it was only\r\nknown at that time that they had to be extruded from the egg, but no\r\none had the remotest idea of their real nature.\r\n\r\nWe now know that they are cells, and that their origin depends on a\r\ntwice repeated division of the egg-cell; but it is a very unequal\r\ndivision, for these 'directive cells' or 'polar bodies' are always much\r\nsmaller than the ovum, and indeed are usually so small that it is easy\r\nto understand why their cellular nature was for so long overlooked.\r\nYet they have always a cell-body, and in many ova, for instance those\r\nof certain marine Nudibranchs, this is quite considerable; and they\r\nhave likewise always a nucleus, which, notwithstanding the smallness of\r\nthe cell-body, is in all cases exactly of the same size as the sister\r\nnucleus which remains behind in the ovum after division--a fact which\r\nis in itself enough to indicate that we have here to do essentially\r\nwith readjustments and changes in the nucleus of the ovum.\r\n\r\nLong before the polar or directive divisions were recognized as\r\ndivisions of the egg-cell it was known that the nucleus of the ovum\r\ndisappeared as soon as the latter attained to its full size within\r\nthe ovary. It was also known that this nucleus--the large so-called\r\n'germinal vesicle' lying in the middle of the ovum--left its central\r\nposition and moved to the upper surface of the ovum, there to become\r\npaler and paler, and ultimately to disappear altogether from the\r\nsight of the observer. By many it was believed that it broke up, and\r\nthat the 'segmentation nucleus,' which is afterwards obvious, is a\r\nnew formation. The truth is that the germinal vesicle, at the time\r\nof its disappearance, is transformed into a division figure which\r\nis invisible without the aid of artificial staining. The nuclear\r\nmembrane breaks up; the centrosome of the ovum, which, although hardly\r\nvisible, had previously lain beside the germinal vesicle, divides\r\ninto two centrosomes and their centrospheres, and these now form the\r\n'mitotic figure' by moving away from each other and sending out their\r\nprotoplasmic rays. This nuclear spindle soon ranges itself at right\r\nangles to the surface of the egg, which at the same time arches itself\r\ninto a protuberance, and soon two daughter-nuclei are formed, one of\r\nthem lying within the protuberance (Fig. 75, _A_, _Rk1_). This soon\r\nseparates itself off from the ovum, surrounded by a small quantity\r\nof cell-substance. The other daughter-nucleus remains within the\r\novum, but neither of them remains in a state of rest; both are again\r\ntransformed into a spindle and divide once more; the minute first\r\n'polar body' dividing into two 'secondary polar bodies' of half the\r\nsize (_B_, _Rk1_), while the nuclear spindle within the egg brings\r\nabout a second division of the ovum (_B_, _Rk2_) whose unequal products\r\nare the second polar cell and the mature ovum--that is, the ovum ready\r\nfor fertilization. The process is now complete; the egg-cell, which\r\nhas lost very little plasmic material through the 'polar bodies' and\r\nhas not become visibly smaller, has now a nucleus (_B_, _Eik_) which\r\nhas become considerably smaller through the two rapidly successive\r\ndivisions, and, as we shall see later, has also undergone internal\r\nchanges. In this state it is 'ripe,' that is, it is ready to enter into\r\nconjugation with the nucleus of a male cell, and this we have already\r\nrecognized as the essential element in the process of fertilization.\r\n\r\nThese processes of 'maturation of the ovum' are common to all animal\r\nova which require fertilization, and they follow almost the same\r\ncourse, only that in many cases the second division of the first\r\npolar body does not take place, so that only two polar bodies in all\r\nare formed. All these processes have nothing directly to do with\r\nfertilization, but it is only through them that the ovum becomes\r\ncapable of fertilization. This does not prevent the spermatozoon from\r\npreviously making its way into the ovum, for this is usually the case\r\n(Fig. 75, _A_, _sp_); there it waits until the second 'directive\r\ndivision' of the ovum has been accomplished, utilizing the time to\r\nbecome transformed in the manner necessary for the conjugation of the\r\ntwo nuclei. Only in a few species, for example in the sea-urchin, does\r\nthe egg complete its polar divisions within the ovary, therefore before\r\nit has come into contact with the sperm at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75. Process of fertilization in _Ascaris\r\nmegalocephala_, the thread-worm of the horse, adapted from Boveri and\r\nVan Beneden. _A_, ovum in process of the first directive division;\r\n_Rk_ 1, first polar body; _sp_, spermatozoon with two chromosomes in\r\nits nucleus, attaching itself to the ovum, and about to penetrate\r\ninto it; a protrusion of the egg-protoplasm is meeting it. _B_, the\r\nsecond directive division has been completed; _Rk2_, the second polar\r\nbody; _Eik_, the reduced nucleus of the ovum. The first polar body\r\n(_Rk_ 1) has divided into two daughter-cells, _spk_; the nucleus of\r\nthe spermatozoon remains visible with its two centrospheres (_csph_).\r\n_C_, the sperm nucleus (♂_k_) and the ovum nucleus (♀_k_) have grown,\r\neach has two loop-like chromosomes; only the male nucleus has a\r\ncentrosphere, which has already divided into two (_csph_). _D_, the two\r\nnuclei lie apposed between the poles of the nuclear spindle. _E_, the\r\nfour chromosomes have split longitudinally; the spindle for the first\r\ndivision of the ovum (the segmentation spindle, _fsp_) has been formed.\r\n_F_, divergence of the daughter-chromosomes towards the two poles;\r\ndivision of the ovum into the first two cleavage cells or embryonic\r\ncells.]\r\n\r\nThat we may be able to penetrate still more deeply into the processes\r\nof fertilization, the best illustration to take seems to me to\r\nbe, as yet, the ovum of the thread-worm of the horse (_Ascaris_\r\n_megalocephala_), which has become famous through the classical\r\nobservations of Ed. van Beneden. Many favourable circumstances\r\nunite in this case to make the essentials of the process clearly\r\nrecognizable. Fertilization takes place within the body of the female,\r\nin an enlarged portion of the oviduct, within which a number of the\r\nremarkable sperm-cells are always found in a mature female. They are\r\nremarkable in being not thread-like, but rather spheroidal cells,\r\nbearing, however, a small protuberance something like a pointed horn\r\n(Fig. 75, _A_, _sp_). When such a sperm-cell comes in contact with the\r\nupper surface of an ovum a swelling forms at the place touched, and the\r\nsperm-cell attaches itself firmly to this, and is drawn by it into the\r\novum. Without doubt, amœboid movements on the part of the sperm-cell\r\nitself play some part in this, as can be most plainly seen in the\r\nlarge sperm-cells of many Daphnids which we have already discussed. In\r\nthe egg of the thread-worm the whole sperm-cell with its nucleus can\r\nsoon be detected within the substance of the ovum, and it then changes\r\nrapidly. Its main body fades more and more completely, until at last\r\nit disappears altogether, while the nucleus becomes vesicle-like and\r\nsoon attains a considerable size (Fig. 75, _B_, _spk_). Meanwhile the\r\nresidue of the germinal vesicle which remained behind in the ovum after\r\nthe second directive division (_B_, _Eik_) has changed into a large\r\nvesicle-like nucleus (_C_, ♀ _k_), which in the ovum of _Ascaris_, as\r\nwell as in the spermatozoon, at first contains a nuclear reticulum with\r\nirregular fragments of chromatin. Later on, these form a spiral coil in\r\nthe manner we have already described, and finally this breaks up into\r\ntwo large and relatively thick angular loops or chromosomes (Fig. 75,\r\n_C_ and _D_, _chr_).\r\n\r\nAt the same time a nuclear division apparatus has formed in the space\r\nbetween the two nuclei--the so-called male and female 'pronuclei'\r\n(♂ _k_, ♀ _k_)--two centrospheres (_csph_) become visible, at first\r\nlying close together, but afterwards moving apart (_D_) to form the\r\npoles of a nuclear spindle, in the equatorial plane of which the four\r\nchromosomes of the male and female pronuclei are now arranged. The\r\nnuclear membranes disappear, and the two nuclei now unite to form one,\r\nthe segmentation nucleus (_D_). A dividing spindle then develops and\r\nbrings about the first embryonic cell-division (_E_), and thus the\r\nbeginning of the 'segmentation' of the ovum; each of the four chromatin\r\nloops splits longitudinally, and each of the split halves migrates, one\r\nto one, the other to the other daughter-nucleus (_F_). As this same\r\nmethod of distribution of the chromatin substance is repeated at every\r\nsuccessive cell-division throughout embryogenesis, and indeed through\r\nthe whole of development, it follows that the result of fertilization\r\nis, that all the cells of the body of the new animal which develops\r\nfrom the ovum contain an equal quantity of paternal and of maternal\r\nchromatin. If we are right in regarding the chromatin substance as the\r\nhereditary substance, it becomes immediately apparent that this equal\r\ndivision is of the most far-reaching importance, for it shows us that\r\nthe so-called process of fertilization is the union of equal quantities\r\nof hereditary substance of paternal and maternal origin.\r\n\r\nThe process of fertilization is now known in all its details in a great\r\nnumber of animals in the most diverse groups; it is everywhere the same\r\nin its essential features; there is always only one sperm-cell which\r\nnormally enters into conjugation with the ovum-nucleus, and in every\r\ncase the sperm-cell, however minute it may be to begin with, forms a\r\nnucleus nearly or exactly as large as the nucleus of the ovum, and in\r\nall cases it contains the same number of chromosomes as the nucleus of\r\nthe ovum. Of special interest, however, is the fact that this number\r\nis always half the number of the chromosomes exhibited by the somatic\r\ncells of the particular animal in question, and that the reduction of\r\nthe number of chromosomes to half the normal is effected in both male\r\nand female germ-cells by the last divisions of these cells, which take\r\nplace before they have attained to a state of maturity. In the ovum the\r\nreduction occurs in the directive divisions, to which we must therefore\r\nturn our attention once more, with special reference to the number of\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\nWe saw that, in the full-grown ovarian egg, the germinal vesicle rises\r\nto the surface and there becomes transformed into the first polar\r\nspindle. Now this shows, in its equatorial plane, double the number of\r\nchromosomes normal to the species. This duplication comes about, not\r\ndirectly before the nuclear division, but much earlier in the young\r\nmother-egg-cell; it is only the change in the time of the splitting\r\nof the chromosomes that is unusual. The first maturation division\r\ntakes place nevertheless in accordance with the usual plan of nuclear\r\ndivision; it is, as I have called it, an 'equation division,' that is,\r\nboth daughter-nuclei again receive the same number of chromosomes as\r\nthe young mother-egg-cell had to start with, namely, the normal number\r\nof the species. Thus, if the young mother-egg-cell had four chromosomes\r\n(Fig. 76, _A_), this number would double to eight at an early stage\r\n(_B_), but the first maturing division would give each daughter-nucleus\r\nfour (_C_ and _D_). In the second maturation division the case is\r\ndifferent, for here no splitting and duplicating of the number of\r\nchromosomes takes place, but the existing number, by being distributed\r\nbetween the two daughter-nuclei, is reduced to half in each (_E_ and\r\n_F_). For this reason I have called it a 'reducing division.' In our\r\nexample, therefore, the ovum, as well as the second polar body, would\r\ncontain only two chromosomes (Fig. 76, _F_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76. Diagram of the maturation divisions of the\r\novum. _A_, primitive germ-cell. _B_, mother-egg-cell, which has grown\r\nand has doubled the number of its chromosomes. _C_, first maturation\r\ndivision. _D_, immediately thereafter; _Rk1_, the first directive cell\r\nor polar body. _E_, the second maturation spindle has been formed; the\r\nfirst polar body has divided into two (2 and 3); the four chromosomes\r\nremaining in the ovum lie in the second directive spindle. _F_,\r\nimmediately after the second maturation division; 1, the mature ovum;\r\n2, 3, and 4, the three polar cells, each of these four cells containing\r\ntwo chromosomes.]\r\n\r\nI cannot enter into the details of the process here, for we are\r\ndealing with essentials and not with isolated and, so to speak,\r\nchance details, but I must emphasize the fact that the same process\r\nof reduction of the number of chromosomes takes place in this or an\r\nanalogous manner in all animal ova, and can be demonstrated also\r\nin most of the chief groups of plants. Whether it be, as many have\r\nmaintained, that the reduction is not always first effected by the\r\n'maturation divisions,' but in some cases takes place earlier in the\r\nprimitive egg-cell[12], so much is certain, that the nuclei which come\r\ntogether for 'fertilization' only contain half the normal number of\r\nchromosomes, and this is true not only of the ovum but also of the\r\nsperm-nucleus.\r\n\r\n[12] See the discussion of this point in chapter xxii.\r\n\r\nArguing from general considerations, but especially from the theory\r\nwhich regards the chromosomes as the bearers of the hereditary\r\nsubstance, I had come to the conclusion, before there was any full\r\nknowledge of the phenomena of the maturation of the ovum, that a\r\nreduction of the chromosomes by half _must_ take place, and had\r\npostulated a similar 'reducing division' for the sperm-cell, and\r\nfurther, for plants as well as animals--indeed, for all sexually\r\nreproducing forms of life. The two divisions in the sperm-cell\r\ncorresponding to the polar divisions of the ovum with their reduction\r\nof chromosomes were demonstrated by Oscar Hertwig in the case of the\r\nthread-worm of the horse (_Ascaris megalocephala_)--a form which\r\nhas proved so very important in relation to the whole theory of\r\nfertilization. It is true that in this case the course of the phenomena\r\nof reduction is less convincing than in some other forms which have\r\nbeen investigated more recently, as, for instance, the mole-cricket and\r\nthe bugs. In these instances, at any rate, a 'reducing division' in\r\nspermatogenesis, quite corresponding to that of the egg-cell, has been\r\ndemonstrated, and this demonstration is of particular value owing to\r\nthe fact that the development of the sperm-cell, as we shall presently\r\nsee, throws an entirely new light on that of the ovum, and especially\r\non the phyletic significance of the polar bodies.\r\n\r\nWe began our consideration of the processes of reduction with the\r\nfull-grown egg-cell, but now let us go back to the earliest rudiments\r\nof the ovary of the embryo, and we find that it consists of a single\r\nprimitive egg-cell, from which, by division, all the other egg-cells\r\narise. In the same way the first rudiment in the testis or spermary\r\nis formed by a primitive sperm-cell, which does not differ visibly\r\nfrom the primitive egg-cell. Both now multiply by division for a\r\nconsiderable time, and in the ovary this is followed by a period of\r\ngrowth, during which multiplication ceases, and each cell increases\r\nconsiderably in size and lays in a store of yolk. Each cell thus\r\nultimately reaches the condition with which we started previously, that\r\nof the full-grown _mother-egg-cell_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the primitive sperm-cells do not exhibit such pronounced\r\ngrowth as the ova, they have likewise their period of growth, during\r\nwhich multiplication by division ceases, and the cells increase only in\r\nsize (Fig. 77, _A_). When they have attained their maximum of growth\r\nthe number of chromosomes is seen to have been doubled by longitudinal\r\nsplitting (as in the diagram, Fig. 77, _B_, from four to eight).\r\nFrom this _mother-sperm-cell_ there now arise by two divisions in\r\nrapid succession (_C_-_F_) four sperm-cells, and the same reduction\r\nof the number of chromosomes to half is effected as in the polar\r\ndivisions of the egg-cell. In the first division, four chromosomes\r\ngo to each daughter-cell (_D_), in the second, two (_F_). The only\r\nessential difference between the corresponding processes in the\r\negg-cell and the sperm-cell lies in the fact that the divisions of the\r\nso-called 'spermatocyte' or mother-sperm-cell are equal, so that four\r\ngranddaughter-cells of equal size arise, while in the mother-egg-cell\r\nor 'ovocyte' the divisions are very unequal. In the former the result\r\nof the divisions is _four_ cells capable of fertilizing, in the latter\r\n_one_ cell capable of being fertilized and three minute 'polar cells'\r\nwhich are incapable of conjugating with a sperm-cell and giving rise to\r\na new individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77. Diagram of the maturation-divisions of the\r\nsperm-cell, adapted from O. Hertwig. _A_, primitive sperm-cell. _B_,\r\nmother-sperm-cell. _C_, first maturation division. _D_ 1 and 2, the two\r\ndaughter-cells. _E_, the second maturation division, by which the four\r\ncells of _F_ arise, each with half the number of chromosomes.]\r\n\r\nThere can thus be no doubt that the polar cells, as Mark and Bütschli\r\nlong ago suggested, are abortive ova, that is, that, at a remote period\r\nin the evolution of animal life, each of these four descendants of a\r\nmother-egg-cell became a germ-cell capable of development. It is not\r\ndifficult to infer that the unequal division, which now leads to an\r\ninsufficient size in three of these descendants, has gone on _pari\r\npassu_ with the continually increasing size of the mature ovum, and had\r\nits reason in the fact that it was important above all things to store\r\nin the ovum as much protoplasm and yolk as possible. We have already\r\nseen that even the dissolution of a number of the sister-cells of the\r\novum is sometimes demanded, so that the ovum may be surrounded by\r\nnutritive follicular cells. In short, the greatest possible quantity of\r\nnourishment is conveyed to the ovum in every conceivable way, and it\r\nis thus stimulated to a growth which no single cell could attain to if\r\nit were dependent on the ordinary nutrition supplied by the blood. And\r\nwe can understand that nature--to speak metaphorically--did not wish\r\nto destroy her own work by finally distributing among four ova all the\r\nnourishment she had succeeded in heaping up in all sorts of ways within\r\nthe mother-egg-cell.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, Why have all these unnecessary divisions been\r\nmaintained up till the present day? Why have they not long ago been\r\ngiven up, since they can and do only lead to the production of three\r\nabortive ova, which are foredoomed to perish? Are they mere vestiges,\r\nprocesses which are in themselves meaningless, but have, so to speak,\r\nbeen maintained by the principle of inertia? This principle is\r\ncertainly operative in some sense and to some extent even in living\r\nnature; a process which has been regularly repeated through a long\r\nseries of generations does not at once cease to be performed when it is\r\nno longer of use to the organism concerned. The eyes of animals which\r\nhave migrated to lightless depths do not disappear all at once and\r\nleave no trace; they degenerate very gradually and only in the course\r\nof many generations; and it would thus be quite possible to defend the\r\nposition that these polar or 'maturation divisions' of the ovum are\r\npurely _phyletic reminiscences_ without actual significance.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot agree with this opinion. If it were actually so we should\r\nexpect that the formation of the polar bodies would not still take\r\nplace in all cases in almost the same manner, for all rudimentary parts\r\nand processes vary greatly; we should expect that in many animal groups\r\nthe polar divisions would not occur, or perhaps that only half the\r\nnumber would occur. But this is not so; in all multicellular organisms,\r\nfrom the lowest to the highest, two reducing divisions take place,\r\nand always in almost the same manner, with the exception of a single\r\ncategory of ova, of which I shall presently have to speak. We shall see\r\nlater that even in unicellular organisms analogous processes may be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nBut it is also intelligible that this twice repeated division of\r\nthe mother-egg-cell is necessary if the reduction in the number of\r\nchromosomes to half is only possible in this way, since _this reduction\r\nis indispensable_. If each of the two conjugating germ-cells contained\r\nthe full normal number of chromosomes, the segmentation-nucleus\r\nwould contain a double number, and if that went on, the number of\r\nchromosomes would increase in arithmetical proportion from generation\r\nto generation, and would soon become enormous. Even though we were not\r\notherwise certain that these chromosomes are units of a permanent\r\nnature, which only apparently break up in the nuclear reticulum,\r\nbut in reality persist, the fact of reduction would point in this\r\ndirection. For if they were not permanent structures and distinct from\r\none another, and if their number depended solely on the quantity of\r\nchromatin which the nucleus contains, the reduction in number might be\r\nsecured if the chromosomes in the growing egg and sperm-cells increased\r\nin size more slowly than the cell-body and the other parts of the cell.\r\nBut from the fact that the reduction takes place not in this simple\r\nway, but, in sperm-cells and in ova which require to be fertilized,\r\nonly through cell-division and a specific mode of nuclear division, we\r\nmay conclude that it cannot happen otherwise, that chromosomes are not\r\nmere aggregates of organic substance, but organs whose number can only\r\nbe reduced by the extrusion of some of them from the cell.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are ova in which the process of reduction does\r\nnot follow the course we have described, but the exceptions only\r\nserve to confirm our view of the reducing significance of the polar\r\ndivisions, and of their persistence because of the necessity for\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the middle of the nineteenth century it was known\r\nthat in various animals the eggs develop without fertilization. This\r\nreproduction by 'parthenogenesis' was first established with certainty\r\nby the German bee-keeper Dzierzon in 1845, and then scientifically\r\ncorroborated by Rudolph Leuckart and C. Th. von Siebold. Although\r\nparthenogenesis was at first observed only in a few groups of the\r\nanimal kingdom, in bees and some nocturnal Lepidoptera (Psychidæ\r\nand Tineidæ), it has become more and more apparent in the course of\r\nyears that this 'virgin reproduction' is by no means a rare form\r\nof reproduction, and that it occurs regularly and normally in many\r\ncases, especially in the very diverse groups of the great series of\r\nArthropoda. Thus among insects it is found in certain saw-flies,\r\ngall-flies, ichneumon-flies, in the honey bee, and in common wasps, and\r\nit is particularly widespread among plant-lice (Aphides) such as the\r\nvine-aphis (_Phylloxera_), whose prodigious multiplication in a short\r\ntime depends partly on the fact that all the generations, with the\r\nexception of one, consist only of females with a parthenogenetic mode\r\nof reproduction.\r\n\r\nAmong the lower Crustaceans also parthenogenesis plays a large rôle,\r\nand in many species it even occurs as the sole mode of reproduction,\r\nbut more often--as is also the case among insects--it occurs\r\nalternately with bi-sexual reproduction. For parthenogenesis must not\r\nbe regarded as asexual reproduction, but rather as _unisexual_, that\r\nis, as arising from sexually differentiated individuals (females),\r\nand from germ-cells (true ova), but brought about by the agency of\r\nindividuals of only one sex, the female. These parthenogenetic eggs\r\nemancipate themselves, so to speak, from the law that was previously\r\nregarded as without exception, that all ova require fertilization to\r\nenable them to develop. That this law admits of many exceptions is\r\nnow universally admitted; thus in the small family of water-fleas\r\n(Daphnids) there are even two kinds of eggs, the summer and winter eggs\r\nwe have already mentioned, which are produced by the same female, and\r\nyet the former kind develop without fertilization, while the latter\r\nrequire to be fertilized before they can develop.\r\n\r\nIt was obviously important to learn the state of affairs in regard to\r\nreducing divisions in parthenogenetic ova, to find out whether here\r\nalso, three, or, in some circumstances, two polar bodies were formed,\r\nand whether the second polar division reduced the number of chromosomes\r\nto half. If the theory previously advanced as to the importance of the\r\nchromatin, and especially of the reducing effect of the second maturing\r\ndivision be correct, we should expect the second division to be wanting\r\nin parthenogenetic eggs, since otherwise the number of chromosomes\r\nwould be reduced to half in each generation, and would thus gradually\r\ndisappear or sink to one.\r\n\r\nHaving directed my attention to this problem, I succeeded in\r\nestablishing for a Daphnid, _Polyphemus_, that the second polar\r\ndivision does not occur, and that only one polar body is formed.\r\nBlochmann found the same in the parthenogenetic eggs of plant-lice or\r\nAphides, in which, moreover, the eggs requiring fertilization exhibit,\r\nlike the winter eggs of Daphnids, two polar divisions. It was thus\r\nestablished that at least those eggs of Aphides and Daphnids which\r\nare wholly parthenogenetic retain the full number of chromosomes\r\nof their species, as is represented in the diagram, Fig. 78. When\r\nparthenogenesis set in the polar divisions were limited to one, and\r\nthat this could happen justifies us in concluding _a posteriori_\r\nthat it could have happened also in the case of ova which required\r\nfertilization if that had been necessary or even merely indifferent.\r\nThe polar divisions are thus not mere 'vestigial' processes; they have\r\nan immediate significance, and it lies in the reduction of the number\r\nof chromosomes.\r\n\r\nBut I must make a reservation here; it is not universally true of\r\nparthenogenetic eggs that maturation takes place without the second\r\npolar division. The first exception was observed in the salt-water\r\ncrustacean, _Artemia salina_. In this case only one polar body is\r\nactually extruded and the number of chromosomes remains normal, as I\r\nwas able to demonstrate with the small number of ova at my disposal;\r\nbut according to the investigations of Brauer on more abundant material\r\nit appears that, while the second polar division is suppressed in the\r\nmajority of the ova, and the external extrusion of a second polar body\r\nnever occurs, the second polar division does nevertheless sometimes\r\ntake place. The two daughter-nuclei arising from this division unite\r\nagain immediately afterwards to form a single nucleus, and this now\r\nfunctions as a segmentation nucleus. Of course it again contains the\r\nfull number of chromosomes, namely, twice 84=168.\r\n\r\nIn _Artemia_, therefore, the adaptation of the ova to parthenogenetic\r\ndevelopment is not yet fully established, and the complete abandonment\r\nof the second polar division seems to be phyletically striven for,\r\nsince, although the division still takes place, its effect is\r\nneutralized immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78. Diagram of the maturation of a parthenogenetic\r\novum. The number of chromosomes normal to the species has been assumed\r\nto be four. _Uei_, a primitive germ-cell. _M Eiz_, a mother-egg-cell,\r\nwith twice the normal number of chromosomes. _Eiz_, mature ovum after\r\nthe separation of the first and only polar body. _Rk_^1.]\r\n\r\nAmong bees the state of affairs is again exceptional. Here the female,\r\nthe so-called queen bee, possesses a capacious sperm-sac, in which\r\nthe spermatozoa received in copulation remain living for years,\r\nand the fertilization of an ovum is effected in the usual way from\r\nthis sac while the egg from the ovary is passing down the oviduct.\r\nThe queen bee has the power of releasing some spermatozoa from the\r\nreceptacle, or of not doing so, and thus of fertilizing the egg, or\r\nof not fertilizing it. Since the notable observations of Dzierzon and\r\nthe investigations of von Siebold and Leuckart which followed them, it\r\nhas been assumed that only those eggs were fertilized which were laid\r\nin the cells destined for rearing females (workers or queens), while\r\nthose which were to give rise to 'drones' or males remained normally\r\nunfertilized. Only in the last decade of the past century did the\r\nbee-keepers begin to cast doubt on this so-called 'Dzierzon theory';\r\nvarious violent and obstinate attacks were made upon it, and these\r\nwere supported by new and apparently convincing experiments. Dickel, a\r\nteacher in Darmstadt, has been particularly strenuous in attempting to\r\noverthrow the old theory, by emphasizing the fact that von Siebold's\r\nold investigations on bee eggs afforded no convincing proof. Von\r\nSiebold made his investigations on eggs freshly taken from the hive,\r\nand was never able to find spermatozoa in 'drone eggs' (that is, eggs\r\nlaid in drone cells and therefore destined to develop into drones),\r\nwhile he was often able to demonstrate the presence of from one to\r\nfour spermatozoa in 'worker eggs.' But he only examined 'drone eggs'\r\nwhich were already twelve hours old, and in these, as we now know, he\r\nwould not have found spermatozoa in any case, even if they had been\r\nfertilized, because in ova at that stage the development of the embryo\r\nhas already fully begun, and nothing remains of the spermatozoa. In\r\nthe bee, according to Buttel-Reepen, the fertilizing spermatozoon is\r\ntransformed in twenty minutes after it has penetrated into the egg into\r\na minute 'sperm-nucleus' which is almost invisible even in sections,\r\nand certainly nothing whatever could be seen of it by the old method of\r\nsqueezing the fresh ovum.\r\n\r\nIt had therefore to be admitted that Dzierzon's theory rested on an\r\ninsecure foundation, and I accordingly set two of my students at that\r\ntime, Dr. Paulcke and Dr. Petrunkewitsch, to examine the eggs of the\r\nbee anew with regard to the point in question, using the greatly\r\nimproved methods at their disposal. These investigations have been\r\ncarried out in the Freiburg Zoological Institute during the last three\r\nyears, and have resulted in establishing the absolute correctness of\r\nDzierzon's theory: the 'drone eggs' do remain unfertilized, while the\r\neggs from which females are to develop are fertilized without exception.\r\n\r\nIn this case, therefore, we have, in the same animal, eggs which\r\ncan be fertilized and eggs which, without fertilization, develop\r\nparthenogenetically, and it is therefore of the greatest possible\r\ninterest to know the state of matters in them in regard to the\r\ndirective divisions and the reduction of the chromosomes.\r\n\r\nDr. Petrunkewitsch's investigations have shown that in both cases,\r\nthat is, whether a spermatozoon penetrates into the ovum or does\r\nnot, a twice-repeated division of the nuclear material in the ovum\r\ntakes place. Moreover, the two daughter-nuclei which result from the\r\nsecond division do not, as Brauer showed was sometimes the case in\r\n_Artemia_, unite again afterwards; they remain separate, and the\r\nnumber of chromosomes--there are sixteen of them--is thereby reduced\r\nto half in the segmentation nucleus. But this is not all, for before\r\nembryonic development has begun the normal number can be again seen in\r\nthe segmentation nucleus; the chromosomes must therefore have _doubled\r\ntheir number by division within the nucleus_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that something similar takes place in the cases of\r\nexceptional parthenogenesis which have long been known, but this point\r\nhas not yet been sufficiently investigated. Nevertheless I cannot pass\r\nthem over, as they are instructive from another point of view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79. The two maturation divisions of the 'drone\r\neggs' (unfertilized eggs) of the Bee, after Petrunkewitsch. _Rsp 1_,\r\nthe first directive spindle. _k 1_ and _k 2_, the two daughter-nuclei\r\nof the same. _Rsp 2_, the second directive spindle. _k 3_ and _k 4_,\r\nthe two daughter-nuclei.

This is interesting enough, but it gains\r\nincreased importance through the investigations of the Russian\r\nnaturalist, Tichomiroff, who succeeded in considerably increasing\r\nthe number of unfertilized eggs that developed by gently rubbing\r\nthem with a paint-brush, or by dipping them for a little in dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. It is thus possible to make eggs, which would not\r\nordinarily develop without being fertilized, capable of parthenogenetic\r\ndevelopment by means of mechanical or chemical stimulus. This sounds\r\nalmost incredible, but it is beyond a doubt, and it is still further\r\ncorroborated by the fact that Prof. Jacques Loeb has succeeded in\r\ninciting the eggs of a sea-urchin to parthenogenetic development by\r\nmeans of a chemical stimulus. When he added to the sea-water in which\r\nthe eggs were laid a certain quantity of chloride of magnesium the\r\nova developed, and not only went through the process of segmentation,\r\nbut even reached the stage of the quaint easel-like Pluteus larva.\r\nQuite recently Hans Winkler has made the interesting observation\r\nthat from sea-urchin sperms which have been killed by heat it is\r\npossible to extract in aqueous solution a substance capable of exciting\r\nunfertilized sea-urchin eggs to development, although they only go as\r\nfar as to the sixteen-cell stage.\r\n\r\nFrom all these results we can at least infer so much, that chemical\r\nchanges and influences may determine whether the ripe ovum shall go on\r\nto embryonic development or not, and that these influences, may be very\r\ndiverse in nature in different cases. I shall return later to these\r\nimportant facts.\r\n\r\nWhen we sum up the facts we have cited with reference to the reduction\r\nof the number of chromosomes, it appears that nature is, as it were,\r\nstriving to keep the number constant for each species; that in\r\ngerm-cells which are destined for amphimixis they are reduced to half\r\nthe normal number, but that this halving of the number is suppressed\r\nwhere fertilization is always absent, or that the reduction to half is\r\ncompensated for again in various ways, whether by subsequent fusion\r\nof the two daughter-nuclei, which have arisen from the process of\r\nreduction, or by an independent duplicating of the chromosomes in the\r\nsegmentation nucleus.\r\n\r\nWe might perhaps be inclined to conclude from all this that the\r\noccurrence of development depended on the presence of the normal\r\nnumber of chromosomes; and I used to regard this as possible. But\r\nfacts which have been more recently brought to light have excluded\r\nthis view. Above all, we now know that every nuclear division depends\r\non the presence of a dividing apparatus, a centrosphere, but that this\r\norgan degenerates in the ova of most animals and is completely lost\r\nafter the second polar division has been effected. The mature ovum is\r\ntherefore in itself incapable of entering on its embryonic development,\r\nno matter how many chromosomes its nucleus contains; it is only capable\r\nof further division when the fertilizing sperm-cell brings with it\r\nits dividing apparatus or centrosphere. In thread-like sperms this\r\nlies in the median portion (Fig. 68_C_), and after the tail-piece has\r\nbeen dissolved, which happens soon after the sperm enters the egg, the\r\ncentral corpuscle, at first very small, can be recognized in front of\r\nthe sperm-nucleus, where it is soon transformed into an 'aster' and\r\ndivides into two. Then both spheres move apart (Fig. 75_D_, p. 296) and\r\nform the nuclear spindle between them by the confluence of their rays.\r\n\r\nFrom this the division of the ovum into the two first embryonic cells\r\nproceeds. The two pronuclei in the ovum, the male and the female, are\r\nthus exactly alike as to number of the chromosomes, and frequently\r\nat least as to size and appearance (Fig. 75_C_). But they differ\r\nin the possession or absence of a dividing apparatus, and in the\r\ngreat majority of cases it is the male nucleus that brings with it\r\nthe central corpuscle which seems to be indispensable to embryonic\r\ndevelopment (_B_, _cspt_). Hitherto, at least, only two exceptions to\r\nthis are known. In the little segmented worm, _Myzostoma_, which is\r\nparasitic on sea-lilies or Crinoids, Wheeler observed that the ovum\r\nretained its central corpuscle even after the polar divisions, while\r\nthe sperm-cell which penetrated into the egg had none. More recently\r\nConklin made the interesting discovery that in the egg of a marine\r\nGasteropod (_Crepidula_) both the egg-nucleus and the sperm-nucleus\r\nretain their centrosphere and together form the segmentation spindle,\r\none lying at one pole and the other at the opposite.\r\n\r\nAll these observations confirm the view that the sperm and the\r\negg-cell are alike in this respect also. Each of them can, in certain\r\ncircumstances, bring with it the dividing apparatus indispensable to\r\ndevelopment, though it is usually the sperm-cell that does so.\r\n\r\nI should indeed assume that the sperm-cell and the egg-cell were\r\nessentially alike, even although there were no exception to this\r\nrule, that is, although the centrosome of the ovum perished in\r\nall eggs which were fertilized. For this is obviously a secondary\r\narrangement, an adaptation to fertilization, that the ovum should be\r\nincapable of development without fertilization, and it is made so by\r\nthe disappearance of its centrosome. In all other cells, as far as is\r\nknown, the central corpuscle persists after division, so that this\r\nremarkable cell-organ is transmitted from cell to cell just like the\r\nnucleus, and like it, never rises _de novo_. It is only in the egg-cell\r\nthat it disappears, though even there often very late, for it may be\r\npresent, as an aster, even after the sperm has penetrated into the\r\novum and disclosed its own central body, or even brought it the length\r\nof dividing into two (Fig. 80, _A_ and _B_). But the ovum-centrosome\r\ndisappears as soon as the second polar division is accomplished.\r\n\r\nThat this disappearance is really a secondary arrangement, which may be\r\nagain departed from, is proved by the case of those eggs which are able\r\nto develop parthenogenetically, for in them the central body does not\r\ndisappear, but persists in the ovum after the first polar division, as\r\nBrauer showed in _Artemia_. It then behaves exactly like the sphere of\r\nthe sperm-nucleus in the fertilized ovum, that is, it duplicates itself\r\nand forms the segmentation spindle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80. Fertilization of the ovum of a Gasteropod\r\n(_Physa_), after Kostanecki and Wierzejski. _A_, the whole spermatozoon\r\nlies in the ovum. _sp_, its already divided centrosphere. _Rk 1_,\r\nthe first polar body. _Rsp 2_, the second directive spindle. _B_,\r\n_spk_, the sperm-nucleus, the second directive spindle still has its\r\ncentrosphere, which afterwards disappears. The first polar body (_Rk\r\n1_) has divided into two. Highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThus the beginning of embryonic development in the ovum depends not on\r\na definite number of chromosomes, but on the presence of an apparatus\r\nfor division. Upon what the awakening of this to activity just at that\r\ntime depends cannot as yet be exactly stated; we can only indicate\r\nthat all parts of the cell have interrelations with each other, and\r\nthat, therefore, the division mechanism is dependent on the condition\r\nof the rest of the cell-parts at the moment, and on the substances\r\nwhich they contain or produce. From what we know experimentally in\r\nregard to artificial parthenogenesis it is not difficult to imagine\r\nthat some sort of chemical substances are necessary to stimulate the\r\ncentral corpuscle to activity. In any case, the whole nutrition of\r\nthe central corpuscle depends on the cell in which it lies, as is\r\nshown by the fact that the sperm-nucleus, whose centrosome before\r\nthe entrance of the sperm into the ovum was inactive and scarcely\r\nrecognizable, grows rapidly after entrance and forms a large aster\r\nround itself--is, in short, in the highest degree active (Fig. 80). As\r\nthe chromosomes certainly play an important part in the life of the\r\ncell, and materially help to determine its various phases, it cannot\r\nbe disputed that they also may share in awakening the activity of the\r\ncentral corpuscle. But this influence is only indirect; it is not the\r\nmere number of chromosomes that decides whether the central corpuscle\r\nis to become active or remain inactive. This cannot be assumed, because\r\nwe have in the maturation divisions a proof that division may take\r\nplace with a double number of chromosomes as well as with the undoubled\r\nnumber; while in the divisions of the mother-egg-cells and the\r\nmother-sperm-cells we have proof that a doubled number of chromosomes\r\ndoes not in itself compel to division.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional and artificially produced cases of parthenogenesis\r\nwhich we have discussed above are probably to be interpreted thus:\r\nthrough slight differences in the constitution of the ovum, or through\r\ncertain mechanical or chemical stimuli, the metabolic processes in\r\nthe ovum are so altered that the centrosome of the ovum, instead of\r\nbreaking up, is stimulated to growth, and thus produces the active\r\ndividing apparatus which is otherwise only brought into it by the\r\nsperm. This is a more exact definition of the interpretation I gave\r\nearlier (1891) of the 'chance' parthenogenesis of the silk-moth, which\r\nwas then the only case known, when I said 'the nucleoplasm of some ova\r\nmust possess the power of growth in a greater degree than the majority.'\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet in a position to go further, or to define more\r\nexactly the nature of the processes of metabolism which are involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XVI\r\n\r\nFERTILIZATION IN PLANTS AND UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS, AND ITS IMMEDIATE\r\nSIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\n Fertilization in a lichen, Basidiobolus--In Phanerogams--Here too\r\n there is reduction of the number of chromosomes by a half--'Polar\r\n cells' in lower and higher plants--Conjugation among unicellular\r\n organisms--Noctiluca--The maternal and paternal chromosomes\r\n remain apart--Actinophrys--Infusoria--Sexual differentiation\r\n of the two conjugates in Vorticella--Importance of the process\r\n of Amphimixis--Not a 'life-awakening' process--May occur\r\n independently of multiplication--The Rejuvenescence hypothesis--Pure\r\n parthenogenesis--The cycle idea--Does Amphimixis prevent natural\r\n death?--Maupas' experiments with Infusorians--Bütschli's\r\n view--Potential immortality of unicellular organisms--The\r\n immortality of unicellular organisms and of the germ-cells depends\r\n on the fact that there is no time-limit to the multiplication\r\n of the smallest living particles--Parthenogenesis is not\r\n self-fertilization--Petrunkewitsch's observations on the ova of\r\n bees--Is the chromatin really the 'hereditary substance'?--Nägeli's\r\n conclusion from the difference in size between ovum and\r\n spermatozoon--Artificial division of Infusorians--Boveri's\r\n experiments with the fertilization of pieces of ova not containing\r\n a nucleus--Fertilization gives an impulse to development even to\r\n non-nucleated pieces of ova--Merogony--The female and male nuclear\r\n substances are essentially alike--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nI NOW turn to the consideration of the process of fertilization in\r\nplants and unicellular organisms.\r\n\r\nWith regard to plants, it can now be definitely asserted that in them,\r\ntoo, fertilization is essentially a conjugation of nuclei; it depends\r\non the union of the nuclei of the two 'sex-cells.' These sex-cells are\r\nusually very small among lower plants, indeed up to the phanerogams;\r\nthis is especially true of the zoosperm-like male germ-cells, but it\r\nusually holds also true of the ovum, which is but seldom burdened\r\nwith an abundant supply of yolk. In spite of the many difficulties\r\nwhich this smallness of size puts in the way of observation, the\r\nuntiring exertions of a host of excellent investigators have succeeded\r\nin following the process of fertilization in all the larger groups\r\nof plants--in algæ, fungi, mosses, ferns, and horse-tails among\r\ncryptogams, and in phanerogams.\r\n\r\nI shall first give an example from among the lower plants (Fig. 81).\r\nIn one of the lichens, _Basidiobolus ranarum_, each of two adjacent\r\ncells in the fungus-thread gives off a bill-like process, and the two\r\nprocesses become closely apposed (Fig. 81, _a_). The nucleus of each\r\ncell moves into the bill-shaped process, is there transformed into a\r\nnuclear spindle (_B_, _ksp_) and divides, so that one daughter-nucleus\r\ncomes to lie in the apex point of the bill, the other at the base.\r\nThe cell-body also divides, though very unequally, and the final\r\noutcome of the process is two cells in each, of which one is small\r\nand occupies the apex of the bill, while the other is large and fills\r\nall the rest of the cell-space. The former do not play any further\r\npart of importance, but break up, the latter are the sex-cells, the\r\ncytoplasm of which now coalesces through a gap in the cell-walls, while\r\ntheir nuclei become closely apposed and ultimately unite (_C_, ♂ and\r\n♀ _k_). From this union arises the fertilized spore, the so-called\r\n'zygote' (_D_). The two small abortive cells so greatly resemble in\r\ntheir origin the polar cells of the animal ovum that it is difficult to\r\nresist the supposition that they bring about a reduction in the number\r\nof chromosomes. But the number of the chromosomes has not yet been\r\ndetermined either in them or in the sex-nuclei.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81. Formation of polar bodies in a lichen,\r\n_Basidiobolus ranarum_. _A_, the two conjugating cells with the\r\nbill-like processes in which the nuclei lie. _B_, the nuclei dividing.\r\n_ksp_, the nuclear spindle. _C_, after the division into a polar body\r\n(_rk_) and a sex-nucleus (♂ _k_ and ♀ _k_). _D_, after the union of\r\nthe nuclei to form a conjugation nucleus (_copk_); the fertilized ovum\r\nis surrounded by envelopes and modified into a lasting spore. After\r\nFairchild.]\r\n\r\nWe have come to know the processes of fertilization among phanerogams\r\nchiefly through Strasburger, Guignard, and more recently through the\r\nJapanese botanist Hirase. The agreement with the animal process is\r\nsurprisingly great, notwithstanding the notable differences in the\r\nexternal conditions of fertilization.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the male cells in the highest flowering plants are\r\nnot zoosperms but roundish cells, each of which, enclosed, together\r\nwith a sister-cell--the so-called 'vegetative' cell--in a thick\r\ncellulose capsule constitutes a pollen-grain. The pollen-grains reach\r\nthe stigma, under which, buried deep within the 'ovule,' the female\r\nsex-cell rests, enclosed in a long, sac-like structure called the\r\n'embryo-sac' (Fig. 82, _A_). Beside it (_eiz_) there lie several other\r\ncells, usually seven in number, two of which, the so-called 'synergidæ'\r\n(_sy_), have their place at one end of the embryo-sac, just in front of\r\nthe ovum (_eiz_). Probably these give off a secretion which exercises\r\nan attractive (chemotactic) influence on the male fertilizing body\r\n('the pollen-tube'), and thus, so to speak, show it the way to the ovum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.

Highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nWhen a pollen-grain has reached the stigma it sends out a tube, usually\r\nafter a few hours, which penetrates into the soft tissue of the\r\nstyle, and grows deep down into the interior of the ovule, ultimately\r\npenetrating as far as the embryo-sac through a special little opening\r\nin the covering of the ovule, the so-called 'micropyle' (Fig. 82_B_,\r\n_pschl_). Its blunt end is now closely apposed to this, so that the\r\ntrue sperm-nucleus (_B_, ♂_k_), surrounded by some protoplasm, can\r\nleave the pollen-tube and wander in among the cells of the embryo-sac.\r\nLater on we shall see that two generative nuclei migrate from the\r\npollen-tube, but in the meantime we shall devote our attention only to\r\none of them, the fertilizing nucleus, which immediately moves towards\r\nthe ovum-nucleus and apposes itself closely to it. Then follows the\r\nfusion or conjugation of the two nuclei, which are alike in size and\r\nappearance, just as in the fertilization of the animal ovum (_C_, ♂ _k_\r\nand ♀ _k_). Whether in this case, too, the sperm-nucleus brings with it\r\na central corpuscle, or whether, as Guignard believed he observed, the\r\novum retains its central corpuscle (_C_, _csph_), or finally, whether\r\nboth modes occur, is not yet known with certainty. The fact that, as\r\na rule, seeds capable of reproduction only form in an ovule when the\r\nstigma has been previously dusted with pollen, leads us to suppose\r\nthat, in this case, as among animals, the ovum lacks something that is\r\nnecessary to induce embryonic development, only retaining this power\r\nin very exceptional cases, namely, when adapted for parthenogenesis.\r\nAnd this something may very well be the dividing apparatus of the cell,\r\nthe centrosome with the centrosphere. But whether this supposition\r\nprove correct or not, a nuclear spindle always forms simultaneously\r\nwith the fusion of the two sex-nuclei into a segmentation nucleus, and\r\nthis spindle is the starting-point of the young plant, thus exactly\r\ncorresponding to the first segmentation of the animal ovum. It agrees\r\nwith it also in the important respect that it again contains the full\r\nnumber of chromosomes--twenty-four in the lily--while the two nuclei,\r\nmale and female, only exhibit half the number each, that is, twelve.\r\n\r\nThus a reduction in the number of chromosomes to half takes place in\r\nplants also, but it is not yet known with certainty whether this is\r\nbrought about in the same way as among animals, namely, by reducing\r\ndivisions. Without entering more fully into this still unsolved and\r\nvery complex problem, I should like to state that I consider this very\r\nprobable; indeed, I agree with the view of V. Häcker[13], that the\r\nreducing divisions of plants are only more difficult to recognize as\r\nsuch, and, furthermore, are often disguised by the fact that they often\r\noccur alongside of, or between divisions which are not reducing. If it\r\nwere possible to reduce the number of chromosomes in a cell to half\r\nwithout the aid of cell-division, if, for instance, only half were to\r\nintegrate again from the chromatin-network, this must have been quite\r\nas possible in the case of animal cells, and then, moreover, the single\r\nchromosome would not have had the significance of an individuality,\r\nand no special form of nuclear division would have been introduced to\r\nreduce their number. That it has been introduced seems to me to prove\r\nthat it was necessary, and since it was so among animals, it could not\r\nhave been dispensed with among plants either.\r\n\r\n[13] See V. Häcker, _Praxis und Theorie der Zellen- und\r\nBefruchtungslehre_, Jena, 1899, pp. 144-5.\r\n\r\nMoreover, throughout the vegetable kingdom divisions often occur in\r\nconnexion with the origin of the sex-cells which can be compared,\r\nin occurrence and result, with the maturation divisions of animal\r\ngerm-cells. In the lichen, _Basidiobolus_, we have already seen that an\r\nabortive cell separates itself off from the sex-cell before the latter\r\nbecomes capable of reproduction (Fig. 81, _C_). Similar cell-divisions\r\noccur in many if not in all groups of plants. In the marine algæ of\r\nthe genus _Fucus_ it has even been proved that the division of the\r\nfirst primordial cell of the ovary into the so-called 'stalk-cell' and\r\nthe primitive egg-cell is a reducing division, and brings down the\r\nnumber of chromosomes from thirty-two to sixteen. In vascular plants\r\nthe reduction is not postponed until the formation of the sex-cells,\r\nbut occurs earlier in the formation of the spores, as Calkins has\r\ndemonstrated for ferns; in the Conifers and other Gymnosperms\r\nseveral so-called 'preparatory' divisions precede the formation of\r\nthe germ-cells, and we know by comparison with the alternation of\r\ngenerations in vascular plants that these are related to the gradual\r\nwaning of the strictly sexual generation. As the 'polar bodies' or\r\n'directive corpuscles' of the animal ovum are rudimentary egg-cells,\r\nso the cells which, in the pollen-grains, separate themselves from\r\nthe sex-cells proper are rudimentary Prothallium-cells, and, like the\r\nanimal cells, they perish without playing any further physiological\r\nrôle. I will not assert that it is precisely in these divisions\r\nthat the reducing divisions are concealed, for the analogy with the\r\nspore-formation of ferns leads us rather to suppose that it may lie\r\nfurther back; but in any case there is no lack of opportunity in the\r\nontogeny of phanerogamic plants for the interpolation of a reducing\r\ndivision, and as long as it remains unproved that a reduction of the\r\nchromosomes can take place directly, that is, without the help of\r\nnuclear division, we shall continue to expect with confidence that the\r\nreducing divisions of phanerogams will be discovered in the future.\r\nProcesses of a similar kind are known among unicellular organisms, and\r\nthere, too, they are associated with nuclear divisions.\r\n\r\nIn passing to the so-called 'sexual reproduction' of unicellular\r\norganisms, I should like first to call attention to the fact that\r\nthe expression 'reproduction' is not very suitable in this case, for\r\nthe process in question does not always effect an increase in the\r\nnumber of individuals as reproduction ought to do, but leads, in\r\nfact, in many cases, even to a decrease, when two individuals unite\r\nto form one. Even if the phenomena of sexual 'reproduction' among\r\nhigher organisms, which we have already studied, had not made it\r\nclear to us that there are two associated processes, quite different\r\nin nature, the conjugation of unicellular organisms would have led\r\nus to that conclusion. It has long been known that two unicellular\r\nplants or animals occasionally become closely apposed and fuse;\r\nand this process of 'conjugation' was many years ago regarded as\r\nan analogue to 'fertilization,' although it is only through the\r\nlaborious investigations of the last two or three decades that\r\nthis supposition has been proved to be correct. We now know that\r\na process quite analogous to that which we have learnt to know as\r\n'fertilization' takes place among unicellulars, only in this case it is\r\nnot directly connected with reproduction and multiplication, but occurs\r\nindependently of them, and, in its most primitive form, it results, not\r\nin an increase but--for a short time at least--in a diminution of the\r\nnumber of individuals. This occurrence of the process independently\r\nof reproduction appears to me of inestimable value theoretically, for\r\nit frees us completely from the old deep-rooted preconceptions in the\r\ninterpretation of fertilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83. Conjugation of Noctiluca, after Ischikawa.\r\n_A_, two Noctilucas beginning to coalesce; _pr_, the protoplasm drawn\r\nout into processes which traverse the gelatinous substance of the\r\ncell; _k_, the nucleus. _B_, the cells and their gelatinous substance\r\nhave fused; the nuclei, in which the chromosomes are visible, are\r\nclosely apposed; _CK_, centrospheres. _C_, the two nuclei are united\r\nin one nuclear spindle; beginning of division. _D_, completion of the\r\ndivision. Highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nFirst let us briefly sketch the process itself in the main forms of its\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive form of conjugation is undoubtedly the complete\r\nfusion of two unicellular organisms of the same species, as we see it\r\nto-day in unicellular plants, and also among the lowest unicellular\r\nanimals, such as the flagellate Infusorians, Gregarines, and Rhizopods.\r\nIt is well seen, for instance, in the Noctilucæ, those unicellular\r\nflagellate organisms which cause the familiar marine phosphorescence\r\nextending uniformly over wide surfaces of water (Fig. 83). In these\r\nforms Prof. Ischikawa of Tokio was able to trace the whole process\r\nof conjugation. To begin with, two Noctilucas range themselves side\r\nby side (Fig. 83) and coalesce at the surfaces in contact, both as\r\nto the spherical gelatinous envelope (_A_, _G_) and the protoplasm\r\n(_pr_) itself, which branches in amœboid fashion into the jelly. The\r\nunion becomes gradually complete, and the two animals form a single\r\nsphere (_B_) with one cell-body. But the two nuclei (_K_) also place\r\nthemselves side by side (_B_), and though they do not actually fuse,\r\nthey form together, under the guidance of two centrospheres (_C_), a\r\nsingle nuclear division-figure, which is obviously analogous to the\r\nsegmentation spindle of the fertilized egg. Then follows a division,\r\nby means of which the chromatin substance of the nuclei of both\r\nanimals is divided between the two daughter-nuclei, and after this\r\nhas been accomplished the united individual again separates into two\r\nindependent Noctilucas (_D_). Although I have spoken here--that is, in\r\nreferring to the Protozoa--of chromosomes, I must immediately add that\r\nthese have not yet been seen with full clearness in Noctiluca itself;\r\nnothing more has been recognized than deeply staining thickenings\r\nof the spindle fibrils, which move from the equator of the nuclear\r\nspindle towards the pole. Since, however, in other Protozoa, as, for\r\ninstance, in the beautiful freshwater Rhizopod (_Euglypha alveolata_),\r\nthese thickenings of the nuclear spindle fibrils have been clearly\r\nrecognized as chromosomes, doubt on this point is hardly justifiable.\r\nApart from this, the assumption that each of the two daughter-nuclei\r\nreceives half the chromosomes of each of the conjugated nuclei rests on\r\na secure basis, not only because otherwise the whole process would have\r\nno meaning, but because the position of the mitotic figure conditions\r\nthis. Even the fact that the two conjugation-nuclei lying side by side\r\nremain apart during nuclear division is not without parallel; Häcker\r\nand Rückert observed it also in the segmentation-nucleus of much higher\r\nanimals, the Copepods, and it has no effect in altering the process of\r\ndivision, but only proves that the chromosomes of maternal and those of\r\npaternal origin in the combination-nucleus remain independent--a fact\r\nthe significance of which I shall discuss later on.\r\n\r\nThe process of conjugation occurs, in the same manner as in\r\n_Noctiluca_, in a freshwater Rhizopod, the well-known Sun-animalcule,\r\n_Actinophrys sol_ (Fig. 84), but in this case complete fusion of the\r\ntwo nuclei takes place (Fig. 84, _V_) before the formation of the\r\ndivision-spindle (_VI_, _sp_), which, with the simultaneous division\r\nof the cell-body, gives rise to two new individuals. The process in\r\nthis case is especially interesting, because Schaudinn has succeeded in\r\nobserving a maturation division (_III_, _Rsp_, directive spindle) as\r\nwell as in demonstrating polar bodies (_IV_, _Rk_). Thus the analogy\r\nwith the process of fertilization in the Metazoa and the Metaphyta is\r\nalmost complete.\r\n\r\nBut that the conjugation of unicellular organisms, like the\r\nfertilization of multicellular organisms, is essentially a matter of\r\nnuclear conjugation is shown more distinctly still by the ciliated\r\nInfusorians, the most highly organized of the Protozoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84. Conjugation and polar body formation in\r\nthe Sun-animalcule, _Actinophrys sol_, after Schaudinn. _I_, two\r\nfree-swimming conjugated individuals, which in _II_ have become\r\nsurrounded by a transparent gelatinous cyst. _III_, formation of\r\nthe directive spindles (_RSp_). _IV_, the polar bodies are formed\r\n(_RK_); _K_, the two sex-nuclei. _V_, these are fused to form the\r\nconjugation-nucleus (_K_). _VI_, the conjugation-nucleus is transformed\r\ninto the division-spindle; the polar bodies (_RK_) have penetrated the\r\ninternal cyst-wall, and are in process of degeneration.]\r\n\r\nHere there is usually no complete union of the cell-bodies of the\r\ntwo animals, but only an adhering of the apposed surfaces. In the\r\nrelatively large _Paramœcium caudatum_ the process of conjugation is\r\nvery exactly known through the beautiful investigations of Maupas\r\nand R. Hertwig. In this case the mouth-surfaces of the two animals\r\ncome together and unite over a short area, and then the two animals\r\nswim about together in this conjugated state. During this time very\r\nremarkable changes take place in their nuclei.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that these Infusorians have a double nucleus, a\r\nlarge one, the macronucleus (Fig. 85, _ma_), and one which is usually\r\nvery small, the micronucleus (_mi_). We may ascribe to the former\r\nof these the guidance and regulation of the everyday processes of\r\nlife, that is, briefly, of metabolism, and the preservation of the\r\nintegrity of the whole animal. The small nucleus has often been\r\ndesignated the 'reproductive nucleus,' but as it plays no other\r\npart in reproduction, as far as can be recognized, than that of\r\ndividing into two daughter-nuclei, I cannot regard this designation\r\nas suitable; it obviously originated in the mistaken interpretation,\r\nprevalent till very lately, of conjugation as a 'kind of reproduction,'\r\nand this in its turn depends on the conception, transferred from\r\nmulticellular organisms, of fertilization as a 'sexual reproduction.'\r\nWe shall immediately see that the micronucleus plays the main part in\r\nconjugation, and from this we may suppose that it otherwise fills no\r\nrôle in the life of the animal, and therefore it may best be designated\r\nthe 'supplementary' or reserve nucleus. In every conjugation the\r\nmacronucleus, which has hitherto been active, breaks up and becomes\r\ncompletely absorbed, very much like a ball of food. This of course\r\ntakes place slowly; the large nucleus elongates, becomes indented,\r\nfalls into several pieces, and these are so gradually absorbed that,\r\neven after the act of conjugation has been accomplished, irregular\r\nfragments of the macronucleus often lie about in the animal (Fig. 85,\r\n9).\r\n\r\nBut while the macronucleus falls to pieces the previously minute\r\nmicronucleus grows enormously and forms a distinct longitudinally\r\nstriated spindle (1, _mi_). About the same time these divide in both\r\nanimals, and each of the daughter-nuclei immediately divides again,\r\nso that after these two divisions four spindle-shaped descendants\r\nof the micronucleus are to be seen in each animal (Fig. 85, 4). We\r\nhave previously noted that the apparatus for nuclear division in\r\nunicellular organisms was similar to that in multicellular organisms,\r\nand yet was different from it. In these ciliated infusorians we see\r\nan essential difference, for the striated spindle, after the division\r\ninto daughter-chromosomes has taken place, lengthens out enormously,\r\nand becomes so thin in the middle of its length (2) that the two\r\ndaughter-nuclei at the ends of this long stalk suggest the appearance\r\nof a very long and thin dumb-bell, or of a long silk purse. Of asters\r\n(centrospheres) there is nothing to be seen, and the mechanism of\r\ndivision is still very obscure; it almost seems as if a rapidly growing\r\nsubstance forced the two groups of chromosomes apart.\r\n\r\nHardly have these four descendants of the micronucleus arisen when\r\nthree of them begin to break up and very shortly disappear; only the\r\nfourth is of any further importance, and it divides once more (5),\r\nand so gives rise to the two nuclei which play the chief part in the\r\nprocess of conjugation--the copulation-nuclei, exactly analogous to\r\nthe male and female pronuclei in the fertilized ovum (5, _mi_^4). But\r\nin this case each of the two animals functions doubly, that is, both\r\nas male and female, for each sends one of the two copulation-nuclei\r\nacross the bridge formed by the union of the apposed surfaces into\r\nthe other animal (6, _mi_ ♂), so that it may form, by union with the\r\nnucleus which has remained there, a double nucleus (7), a structure\r\nwhich corresponds to the segmentation nucleus of the ovum (_copk_).\r\nFrom it there then arises by division a new macronucleus and a new\r\nmicronucleus, not usually directly, however, that is, not by a single\r\ndivision, but through several successive nuclear divisions, into the\r\nmeaning of which I cannot here enter. Immediately after the union of\r\nthe two sex-nuclei the two animals sever their connexion with each\r\nother; each begins again to feed, and is subject to multiplication by\r\ndivision just as it was before conjugation took place (8 and 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85. Diagram of the conjugation of an Infusorian,\r\n_Paramœcium_, after R. Hertwig and Maupas. 1, two animals with the\r\nmouth-openings apposed; _ma_, the macronucleus beginning to degenerate;\r\n_mi_^1, the micronucleus has already increased considerably in\r\nsize and is beginning to divide. 2. each micronucleus has divided\r\ninto two daughter-nuclei (_mi_^2), which are connected only by the\r\ndivision-strand (_ts_). 3, to the left each of the daughter-micronuclei\r\n(_mi_^2) is beginning to divide; to the right this division is already\r\ncompleted and the grand-daughter-nuclei of the original micronucleus\r\nhang together by their division-strands (_ts_). 4, in each of the\r\nanimals there are now four grand-daughter-micronuclei (_mi_^3). 5,\r\nthree of these are in process of dissolution, the fourth is dividing\r\ninto two great-grand-daughter-nuclei (_mi_^4), which are the two\r\nsex-nuclei. 6, one (the male) sex-nucleus (_mi_ ♂) migrates into the\r\nother animal, and there unites with the remaining (female) sex-nucleus.\r\n7, the conjugation-nucleus (_copk_) being formed. 8, the animals\r\nhave separated; the conjugation-nucleus divides into (9) the new\r\nmacronucleus (_n ma_) and the new micronucleus (_n mi_).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the course of this remarkable process exhibits all manner of\r\ndifferences in detail in different species, it is everywhere the same\r\nin its essential feature, and this essential feature is undoubtedly the\r\nunion of an equal quantity of the nuclear substance of two animals to\r\nform a new nucleus. It is thus essentially the same process which we\r\nhave already recognized among higher animals as 'fertilization.' The\r\ndifferences are of minor importance, and they arise partly from the\r\nfact that the sex-cells of multicellular animals are not independent\r\nself-supporting units, and partly from their differentiation into\r\n'male' and 'female' cells. The minuteness of the sperm-cell, for\r\ninstance, conditions its penetration of the ovum, which is always much\r\nlarger and passive, and also the thorough fusion of its cell-body with\r\nthe cell-body of the ovum. That this difference has very little deep\r\nsignificance is best seen from the fact that, even among Infusorians,\r\nthere are forms in which the two conjugating individuals are quite\r\ndifferent, especially in size, and in which the much smaller 'male'\r\nanimal fuses completely with the much larger 'female,' and indeed bores\r\nits way into it after the manner of a sperm-cell. This is the case\r\namong the bell-animalcules (Vorticellinæ) (Fig. 86), the conjugating\r\npairs of which had been observed long before our present insight\r\ninto these processes had been attained. Indeed, the facts had been\r\ninterpreted as a kind of 'budding process,' the minute and differently\r\nshaped 'male' animal (_mi_), which at the time of conjugation is\r\nattached to the larger 'female' (_ma_), was regarded as its bud. This\r\nsupposed bud, however, does not grow out from the animal, but into it!\r\n\r\nThus we see here again that a differentiation of individuals as males\r\nand females may occur among unicellular organisms, just as in the\r\nsex-cells of higher animals and plants, and this proves to us once\r\nmore that all these differences of sex, whether in reproductive cells\r\nof multicellular organisms, or in the entire multicellular animal or\r\nplant, or finally, in unicellular organisms, are not of essential,\r\nbut only of secondary significance, however important they may be for\r\nsecuring fertilization or conjugation in each special case. They are\r\nalways only adaptations to the special conditions, and only occur where\r\nthey are necessary to ensure the union, and always in such a manner\r\nthat the union of the two cells is facilitated. In most Infusorians\r\nsuch a differentiation into male and female animals was not necessary,\r\nbecause these organisms are very motile, and are thus readily able\r\nto meet and unite; it was therefore sufficient for them to remain\r\nhermaphrodite. The bell-animalcules, however, are sedentary, and for\r\nthem it was obviously an advantage that, at the time of conjugation,\r\nsmaller, free-swimming, and also more simply organized individuals\r\nshould arise, which were able to seek out the larger sedentary forms.\r\nHere, then, as in many other unicellular animals, these little male\r\nindividuals only occur when they are necessary, that is, at the time of\r\nconjugation. Similarly, in the green alga, _Volvox_, male and female\r\ncells arise only at the time of conjugation, reproduction being at\r\nother times effected by means of parthenogonidia, that is, by elements\r\nwhich require no fertilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86. Conjugation of an Infusorian. _Vorticella\r\nnebulifera_, showing sexual differentiation of the whole organism.\r\nAfter Greef. _I_, the 'microgonidium' or male individual (_mi_)\r\nattaches itself to the 'macrogonidium' or female individual (_ma_);\r\n_cv_, contractile vacuole; _st_, contractile stalk. _II_, the ciliated\r\ncircle on the male individual has disappeared.

Magnified about 300\r\ntimes.]\r\n\r\nAs these differences are only adaptations to the necessity that the\r\nanimals or cells shall find each other and unite, so also are all the\r\nother differences of a sexual kind, the thousand-fold differences\r\nbetween the sperm-cell and the egg-cell, and the not less numerous\r\ndifferences between male and female animals, both in 'primary' and\r\nespecially in the diverse 'secondary' sexual characters which we have\r\npreviously discussed; all these are only means for bringing about the\r\nprocess of the union of two germ-cells to form a fertilized 'ovum'\r\nwhich is capable of development. The essential part of this so-called\r\n'sexual reproduction' does not, however, depend on these differences,\r\nneither on the sexual differences of the germ-cells nor on those of\r\nthe whole organism; it lies solely in the actual union of the two\r\ngerm-cells. Let us remember the idea we have already emphasized, that\r\nthe _essential part_ of the so-called 'sexual reproduction' does not\r\ndepend on these differences, and let us hold fast to the idea already\r\nindicated, that the chromosomes of the nucleus are the real bearers of\r\nthe hereditary tendencies; then we see that the mingling, or, better,\r\nthe union of the hereditary substances of two different individuals,\r\nwhether single-celled or many-celled, is the result of the process\r\nwhich we have hitherto called fertilization or conjugation, but which\r\nwe shall henceforward designate by the more general term 'Amphimixis'\r\nwhich means the mingling of substances contributed from two distinct\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nHaving made ourselves acquainted with the phenomena of amphimixis in\r\nanimals, plants, and unicellular organisms, we have to face the problem\r\nof the significance of this remarkable and complicated process. What is\r\nit that happens, and what meaning can we attach to it?\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done is to show that the old and long-prevailing\r\nconception of fertilization as _a life-awakening process_ must be\r\nentirely abandoned. That a new individual can arise even among highly\r\norganized animals, quite independently of fertilization, is proved by\r\nthe parthenogenetic eggs of insects and crustaceans; fertilization\r\nis not the spark 'which falls into the powder-cask' and causes the\r\nexplosion; it is only an indispensable condition of development. As we\r\nhave seen, there are germ-cells which are not sexually differentiated,\r\nsuch as the spores of the lower plants, which are all capable of\r\ndevelopment without amphimixis; and parthenogenetic ova prove that\r\neven differentiated female germ-cells, that is, germ-cells originally\r\nadapted for amphimixis, may in certain circumstances develop without\r\nit; amphimixis is thus not the fundamental cause of development, but\r\nis only, for many germ-cells, one of the conditions which must be\r\nfulfilled before development can set in. It is a condition which, under\r\ncertain circumstances, may be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the multiplication of individuals by single-celled germs\r\ncan take place independently of amphimixis, we may conclude that the\r\nestablishment of amphimixis has nothing to do with the capacity for\r\nmultiplication, that it is not a life-awakening process, but is a\r\nprocess of a unique kind, which means something quite different. The\r\nwhole conception of the awakening of life in the germ is antiquated and\r\nout of harmony with the present state of our knowledge. _Life never\r\nbegins anew_, as far as we can see, and apart from the possibility\r\nthat, unknown to us, a spontaneous generation (_Urzeugung_) of the\r\nlowest forms of life is still taking place, life is continuous and\r\nconsists of an infinite series of living forms between which there\r\nis no real interruption. Life, in fact, is like a continuous stream,\r\nthe larger and smaller waves of which are particular species and\r\nindividuals. Only a few decennia ago a morphologist, who was rightly\r\nheld in high esteem, could champion the idea that the mature ovum of\r\nanimals was lifeless material, which had to be quickened in order to\r\ndevelop, but now such a theory is untenable, since we have become\r\naware of the phenomena of maturation in the ovum, and know that most\r\nimportant vital processes, the reducing divisions, take place at the\r\ntime of maturation, quite independently of fertilization.\r\n\r\nThus we do not even require to take into account the conjugation of\r\nunicellular organisms to make it clear that amphimixis is not the cause\r\nof the origin of new individuals, but a process, _sui generis_, which\r\nmay indeed be associated with the beginning of embryonic development,\r\nbut which may also occur independently of it, as we see in the case of\r\nunicellular organisms. If, on the one hand, we see development taking\r\nplace in spores and parthenogenetic ova independently of amphimixis,\r\nand on the other hand amphimixis occurring without reproduction in\r\nunicellular organisms, we must regard the two phenomena, amphimixis\r\nand reproduction, as processes of a distinct kind, which may, however,\r\noccur in association with and interdependence upon each other.\r\n\r\nIt was by chance that human observation brought the latter fact to\r\nlight first, and therefore led us for so long to accept the idea that\r\n_fertilization_, that is, amphimixis, and _development_, that is,\r\nreproduction, are one and the same; and thus it happens that even now\r\nthere are many naturalists who cannot rid themselves of the idea that\r\namphimixis, if not a life-awakening, is at least a _life-renewing_\r\nprocess, a so-called 'process of rejuvenescence.'\r\n\r\nMore than ten years ago[14] I disputed this view, and since then\r\nthe facts which make it untenable have become more and more clear.\r\nNotwithstanding this I see that it is still adhered to, at least in a\r\nmodified form, by many esteemed naturalists, and so it does not seem\r\nsuperfluous to discuss it in more detail.\r\n\r\n[14] _Die Bedeutung der sexuellen Fortpflanzung für die\r\nSelektionstheorie_, Jena, 1886.\r\n\r\nI have already noted that we see in conjugation an amphimixis without\r\nreproduction, and in spores and parthenogenetic ova reproduction\r\nwithout amphimixis, and I do not doubt that every unprejudiced critic\r\nwill admit this; many among us, however, are not unprejudiced, but are\r\nunder the spell of earlier ideas, so that they cannot forget that it\r\nwas long believed that fertilization was an indispensable condition\r\nof development; they therefore regard the divisions which recommence\r\nsooner or later after conjugation, and which may be repeated hundreds\r\nof times, _as conditioned by the conjugation which preceded them_,\r\nand compare them to the series of cells which, in the Metazoa, lead\r\nfrom the fertilized ovum to the fully-formed animal. They regard both\r\nseries of cell-generations as a developmental cycle, which leads from\r\nfertilization to fertilization again, from conjugation to conjugation,\r\nand which would be impossible without either fertilization or\r\nconjugation.\r\n\r\nThis play with the idea of a 'cycle' reminds me vividly of similar\r\nfantastic play from the time of the much-despised 'Naturphilosophie' of\r\na hundred years ago. As men sought to find the analogues of 'solar' and\r\n'planetary' systems in animal and plant, and believed they had stated\r\nsomething when they compared the motile animals to planets and the\r\nsedentary plants to the sun (!), so it is now imagined that a deeper\r\ninsight has been gained by the recognition of cycles of development.\r\nBy all means let us regard the development of a multicellular organism\r\nas cyclic; it returns again to its starting-point, but this no more\r\nexplains the forces which produce the cycle, and thus the meaning of\r\nfertilization, than a comparison with the circling planets explains\r\nthe causes of locomotion in animals. With quite as much reason the\r\ncycle of development might be made to start from the parthenogenetic\r\novum, and then the whole conclusion of the fanciful cycle idea in\r\nregard to the meaning of fertilization falls to the ground, for in\r\nthis case the cycle begins without fertilization. Attempts are made to\r\nget over this difficulty by showing that in many cases parthenogenesis\r\nalternates regularly or irregularly with sexual reproduction, as in\r\nthe water-fleas (Daphnids), the Aphides, and so on. The mysterious\r\nrejuvenating power of amphimixis is supposed to suffice for several\r\ngenerations, a purely gratuitous assumption, which is also in open\r\ncontradiction to the facts. For there are species which now reproduce\r\nexclusively by parthenogenesis, among plants for instance, a number\r\nof fungi, among animals a few species of Crustaceans. Of the latter\r\nit can be demonstrated that ages ago they reproduced sexually, for\r\nthey still possess the sac which serves for receiving spermatozoa, but\r\nthis sac remains empty, for there are now no males, at least in any\r\nhabitat of the species known to us. To this set belongs an inhabitant\r\nof stagnant water, _Limnadia hermanni_, a species of Crustacean which\r\nwas found thirty years ago in hundreds, all of the female sex, near\r\nStrassburg, and also many of the little Ostracods (_Cypris_) which\r\ninhabit especially the muddy bottom of our pools and marshes. I bred\r\none of these (_Cypris reptans_) in numerous aquaria for sixteen years,\r\nduring which there were about eighty generations, and throughout this\r\ntime no male ever appeared, nor did the sperm-sac of the female ever\r\ncontain spermatozoa. The after-effects of the 'rejuvenating' power of\r\nan amphimixis supposed to have taken place earlier must in this case\r\nhave been enduring indeed!\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it seems to me useless to make comparisons between\r\nthe developmental cycle of unicellular organisms and the ontogeny of\r\nmulticellular organisms. Both processes have indeed many points of\r\nresemblance--long series of cells, then interruption of the divisions\r\nand the occurrence of amphimixis--so that we may quite well speak of\r\ncyclic development in the physiological sense, in as far as certain\r\ninternal conditions periodically recur and compel the organism to\r\nconjugation, but we must not suppose that there is more in this than,\r\nfor instance, in the 'cyclic development' of Man, which consists in\r\nthe fact that he finds himself periodically impelled to take food. The\r\nfeeling of hunger which forces him to do so is the signal which warns\r\nthe organism that it is time to supply fresh combustible material to\r\nthe metabolism. In the same way, after a long series of generations\r\nof Infusorians the necessity for conjugation arises; the whole colony\r\nsuffers an 'epidemic of conjugation,' and the animals unite in pairs;\r\nin the meantime we know not why, and must content ourselves with\r\nformulating what is observable, that _the nuclear substances of two\r\nindividuals are thereby mingled in each conjugate_.\r\n\r\nObviously the impulse to conjugation is a signal in the same sense as\r\nthe feeling of hunger is, and we know well from the higher animals what\r\na mighty influence it exerts, an influence hardly less potent than that\r\nof hunger. In Schiller's words, 'Durch Hunger und durch Liebe, erhält\r\nsich dies Weltgetriebe.'\r\n\r\nWe can see clearly enough why Nature should have given animals the\r\nfeeling of hunger, but the reason for the need of conjugation is not so\r\nplain; we can only say in the meantime that it must be of some value in\r\nmaintaining the forms of life, for only that which fulfils a purpose\r\ncan be permanently established.\r\n\r\nI shall return later to the problem of the meaning of 'sexual\r\nreproduction,' and try to probe more deeply into the meaning of its\r\nestablishment; in the meantime I must restrict myself to having shown\r\nits significance in the union of the hereditary substances of two\r\nindividuals, and at the same time to controverting the theory of the\r\n'rejuvenating power' of amphimixis. I use this expression in its\r\noriginal sense, which indicates that every life is gradually wearing\r\nitself away and would become extinct were it not fanned to flame again\r\nby amphimixis--by an artifice of Nature, we may say. This conception\r\nrests on the fact that the cells of the multicellular body possess for\r\nthe most part only a limited length of life, for they are used up by\r\nthe processes of life, and they break up and die, some sooner, some\r\nlater. As it is observed that all true somatic cells, among higher\r\nanimals at least, are subject to this law of mortality, but that the\r\ngerm-cells are not, and that, furthermore, the germ-cells only develop\r\nwhen they are fertilized, the cause of the potential immortality of\r\nthe germ-cells is believed to lie in amphimixis, and a 'rejuvenating'\r\npower in fertilization, or, more generally, in amphimixis, is inferred.\r\nMystical as this sounds, and little as it agrees with our otherwise\r\nmechanical conceptions of the economy of life, it was until very\r\nrecently a widespread view, although perhaps it is now abandoned by\r\nmany who formerly held it, and has been imperceptibly modified into\r\na quite different conception, for which the word 'rejuvenescence' is\r\nretained, but with the altered meaning of a mere 'strengthening of the\r\nmetabolism' or 'of the constitution.' By many authors, indeed, the two\r\nmeanings of the word are not clearly kept apart. I shall return later\r\nto the modified meaning of the word 'rejuvenescence,' and shall keep\r\nin the meantime to the original meaning of the word, which implies a\r\nrenewal of life which would otherwise die out.\r\n\r\nThis meaning seemed to gain a firm hold, when, about fifteen years ago,\r\nthe French investigator Maupas published his remarkable observations\r\non the conjugation of Infusorians. These seemed to show that colonies\r\nof Infusorians which were artificially prevented from conjugating\r\ngradually died out; not of course at once, but after many, often\r\nseveral hundred, generations; ultimately a degeneration of all the\r\nanimals in such colonies set in, and ended only with their utter\r\nextinction. Maupas himself interpreted this as _a senile degeneration_\r\nwhich took place because conjugation had been prevented, and he\r\ntherefore regarded conjugation as a '_rajeunissement karyogamique_,'\r\na rejuvenescence, and therefore a means of preventing the ageing and\r\nfinal dying off of the individuals--of obviating, in short, the natural\r\ndeath to which in his opinion they would otherwise be subject. This\r\nconception was greeted with general approval, and there are many people\r\nwho still regard conjugation as a process by which the capacity for\r\nlife is renewed--a view which I must still dispute as emphatically as I\r\ndid some years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the observations on which this theory is based\r\nadmit of another interpretation, quite different from that which has\r\nbeen assumed to be the only possible one. Maupas prevented conjugation,\r\nnot perhaps because he had isolated individuals and their progeny, but\r\nby exposing the whole colony of near relatives to unusual conditions\r\nwhen conjugation was just about to set in, namely, by supplying\r\nthem with particularly abundant food. The need for conjugation then\r\ndisappeared, as, conversely, it could be called forth at any time in\r\na colony by hunger. But these are artificial conditions, and indeed\r\nthe breeding of Infusorians for months in a small quantity of water on\r\nthe object-glass certainly does not correspond to natural conditions.\r\nWe must admire the skill of the investigator who was able to keep his\r\ncolonies alive for months and years under such artificial conditions,\r\nbut we may venture to doubt whether the fate of extinction which did\r\nultimately overtake them was really due to the absence of conjugation,\r\nand not to the unnaturalness of the conditions.\r\n\r\nIn any case a repetition and modification of Maupas' experiments is\r\nvery desirable, and would be of lasting value[15].\r\n\r\n[15] Since the above was written Calkins has made a series of new\r\nexperiments, the results of which differed in several respects from\r\nthose yielded by Maupas' experiments. When his infusorian-cultures\r\nbegan to grow weaker, as happened frequently and at irregular\r\nintervals, he was always able to restore them to more vigorous life by\r\na change of diet, and especially by substituting grated meat, liver,\r\nand the like for infusions of hay. Certain salts, too, had the same\r\neffect: the animals became perfectly vigorous again. Calkins believes\r\nthat chemical agents, and especially salts, must be supplied to the\r\nprotoplasm from time to time. He reared 620 generations of Paramœcium\r\nwithout conjugation. But the 620th was weakly and without energy. The\r\naddition of an extract of sheep's brains made them perfectly fresh\r\nand vigorous again. Further experiments in this direction are to be\r\ndesired, but, according to those of Calkins, it is probable that\r\nInfusorians can continue to live for an unlimited time even without\r\nconjugation.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, assume for the moment not only that Maupas'\r\nobservations were correct, which I do not doubt, but also that they\r\nwere rightly interpreted. Would they in that case afford a proof that\r\namphimixis means a rejuvenescence of the power of life? To my thinking,\r\nnot in the remotest degree.\r\n\r\nIt certainly seems as if this were true at the first glance; the\r\ncolony which is prevented from conjugating goes on multiplying for a\r\nconsiderable time, often indeed for hundreds of generations, but this\r\nmay be compared with sufferers from hunger, whose life does not cease\r\nat once if the feeling of hunger is not appeased.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly made evident by these experiments that Infusorians\r\nwhich were prevented from conjugating were incapable of unlimited\r\npersistence. But even this in no way proves that amphimixis has a\r\npower of rejuvenating life, but simply that these animals are adapted\r\nfor conjugation, and that they degenerate without it, just as the\r\nsperm-cell or the ovum dies if it does not attain to amphimixis.\r\n\r\nMy opponents take it as axiomatic that the life-movement must come to\r\na standstill of itself, and that it therefore requires help. Even so\r\ndistinguished a specialist on the Protozoa as Bütschli argues that\r\norganisms are not _perpetua mobilia_, and when one remembers the\r\nphysicist's theory of the impossibility of a _perpetuum mobile_ this\r\nlooks at first sight like a formidable objection. But does the organism\r\nalways remain the same as long as it lives, like a pendulum which\r\nfriction causes to swing more and more slowly till ultimately it comes\r\nto a standstill? We know surely that the phenomena of life arise from\r\na continual process of combustion, which is followed by a constant\r\nreplacement of the used-up particles by new particles; we know that\r\nlife depends on an unceasing metabolism, which brings about changes\r\nin the material basis of the organism every moment, so that it is\r\nconstantly becoming new again.\r\n\r\nI shall attempt to show later on that the cells cannot be the ultimate\r\nelements of the organism, but that the life-units visible with\r\nthe microscope must be made up of smaller invisible units. These,\r\ntherefore, undergo 'metabolism,' which conditions their multiplication\r\nand their destruction, and this 'metabolism' is not to be seen only in\r\nthe building up and breaking down of 'albuminoid substances,' as the\r\nphysiologists say, but in the alternation between the multiplication\r\nand the dissolution of these smallest vital particles. Therefore, it\r\nseems to me that the movement of life, whether in a single-celled or\r\nin a many-celled organism, is not to be compared to one pendulum,\r\nbut to an endless number of pendulums which succeed one another\r\nimperceptibly in the course of the metabolism, always producing anew\r\nthe same result, which therefore may continue _ad infinitum_. Suppose,\r\nthen, that we possessed our present conception of life as a process of\r\ncombustion, and of metabolism as the agency which continually provides\r\nnew combustible material in the shape of new vital particles, but that\r\nwe knew nothing about multicellular organisms and their transitory\r\nexistence, but were acquainted only with unicellular organisms and\r\ntheir unlimited multiplication by division. If we were then to make\r\nthe observation that all multicellular organisms are mortal, subject\r\nto natural and inevitable death, it would at first appear to us quite\r\nunintelligible, since we should be aware that in these also the fire\r\nof life is continually being fed by the supply of new combustible\r\nmaterial. Not the potential immortality of unicellular organisms would\r\nthen appear to us remarkable and surprising, but the limitation of the\r\nlife of multicellular organisms--the occurrence of natural death. Who\r\nknows whether, in that case, many of those investigators trained in\r\nregard to unicellular organisms alone would not say just the opposite\r\nof what Bütschli has said, that there could be no natural death in\r\nmany-celled organisms, since single-celled organisms prove to us that\r\nlife is an endless chain of transitory minute vital units?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our physiologists are still far from being able to explain\r\nthe natural death of many-celled organisms from below--I mean from a\r\nknowledge of its necessary causes; on the contrary, they argue from\r\nthe known occurrence of natural death to the causes which underlie\r\nit; and thus they have arrived at the idea, undoubtedly correct, that\r\nthe somatic cells of the body are gradually so altered by their own\r\nactivity that they are ultimately unable to function any longer and\r\nmust die off. Therefore, if we were unacquainted with death, we should\r\nnot have been able to infer it from our physiological knowledge, and\r\nstill less from our knowledge of the unicellulars.\r\n\r\nAs our insight has in point of fact grown by starting from the\r\nmortal many-celled organisms, and has only later penetrated down to\r\nthe unicellular organisms, so we can understand the genesis of the\r\nconclusion, deduced from the mortality of the many-celled organisms,\r\nthat unicellular organisms also are unable to continue without limit\r\nthe renewal of material and of vital particles, and that consequently\r\nthey would be subject to natural death if nature had not found in\r\nconjugation a 'remedy' for 'the physiological difficulties which ensue\r\nautomatically and necessarily from the constitution and from the\r\ncontinual functioning' even of unicellular organisms.\r\n\r\nBut we ask in vain for a shadow of proof of this remarkable conception;\r\nit is an axiom deduced from our knowledge of natural death among\r\nmulticellular organisms, and bolstered up by a mistaken application of\r\nthe idea of 'perpetual motion.' Or may we regard it as a proof of this\r\nif it should be found that all unicellular organisms are adapted for\r\nconjugation?\r\n\r\nWe shall see later on that amphimixis has certainly quite a different\r\nand, undoubtedly, a very important effect, namely, that it increases\r\nthe capacity of the species for adaptation; and a life-renewing\r\neffect in Bütschli's sense could only be ascribed to it in addition\r\nif the assumption of the necessity of a natural death in unicellular\r\norganisms were not directly contrary to the clear facts of the case;\r\nbut this is just what it is.\r\n\r\nWe are acquainted with such contradictory facts, not perhaps among\r\nthe unicellulars themselves, where it is difficult to procure direct\r\nproof, but in regard to the germ-cells of many-celled organisms which\r\ncorrespond to unicellular organisms. We know that under certain\r\ncircumstances the ovum is capable of persisting by itself--in cases\r\nof parthenogenesis--how then can we conclude that amphimixis is in\r\nthe case of Metazoan germ-cells the cause of their capacity for\r\ndevelopment? We can only conclude, it seems to me, that their power of\r\ndeveloping is usually bound up with the occurrence of amphimixis. So we\r\nmay conclude in regard to the unicellulars that their unlimited power\r\nof multiplication is bound up with the occurrence of amphimixis, but\r\nnot that amphimixis is the cause of this power, or that it implies a\r\nrejuvenescence of life. If unicellular organisms could have been made\r\nimmortal through amphimixis, then what I maintain would be proved--that\r\nthey possess potential immortality; but if they did not possess it, no\r\nartifice in the world could give it to them; amphimixis could be at\r\nmost only the condition with the fulfilment of which the realization of\r\ntheir immortality was bound up.\r\n\r\nOne may ask, How then can amphimixis be a condition of their survival?\r\nwhy should Infusorians which have not conjugated at the proper time be\r\ndoomed to extinction? And from the standpoint of our present knowledge\r\nI am as little able to give a precise answer as my opponents. But I\r\ncan give one in relation to the amphimixis of multicellular organisms,\r\nfor in regard to these we know that each of the germ-cells--male and\r\nfemale--uniting in fertilization, is of itself incapable of development\r\nand doomed to perish, the sperm-cell because it is too small in mass\r\nto be able to develop the whole organism, and the ovum because, in\r\norder to become capable of being fertilized, it must undergo certain\r\nchanges which make it incapable of independent development. We have\r\nseen that after the two maturing divisions in the egg-cell have been\r\naccomplished the ovum no longer contains a mechanism of division,\r\nas the centrosphere breaks up after the second division; embryonic\r\ndevelopment can therefore only begin when a new centrosphere has\r\nbeen introduced into the ovum, and this is normally brought about\r\nby fertilization, that is, by the entrance of the sperm-cell, whose\r\nnucleus is accompanied by a centrosphere.\r\n\r\nThus amphimixis is seen to be really a condition of development. But\r\nwe now know that the ovum can emancipate itself from this condition,\r\nby only going through a part of the processes of maturation which are\r\nrelated to the subsequent amphimixis, and by thus retaining its own\r\ncentrosome. Nothing is more instructive in this connexion than the\r\ncases we have already briefly discussed of facultative or occasional\r\nparthenogenesis. We have seen that in some insects, for instance in\r\nthe silk-moths, there are sometimes, among thousands of unfertilized\r\neggs, a few that develop little caterpillars. If we examine a large\r\nnumber of such unfertilized eggs we not infrequently find among them\r\nseveral which, although they have not gone through the whole course of\r\ndevelopment, have at least gone through the earlier stages, and others\r\nwhich may have advanced somewhat further and then come to a standstill;\r\nin short, we can see that several of these eggs were capable of\r\nparthenogenetic development, although in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this parthenogenetic capacity has not as yet been\r\ndefinitely determined by observation, but we shall hardly go wrong\r\nif we seek it in the fact that the centrosphere of the ovum does\r\nnot always perish immediately and completely during maturation, and\r\nmay persist, rarely in its integrity, but sometimes in a weakened\r\nstate. Future observations will probably reveal some differences in\r\nthe size or aster-forming power of the centrospheres of such eggs;\r\nin any case it is of the greatest interest that stimuli of various\r\nkinds--mechanical or chemical--can strengthen the disappearing\r\ncentrosphere of the ovum, although as yet we are far from being able to\r\nsay how this comes about.\r\n\r\nThe experiments already mentioned of Tichomiroff, Loeb, and Winkler\r\ngive us at least an indication how we must picture to ourselves the\r\norigin of parthenogenesis, namely, through the fact that the breaking\r\nup of the apparatus for division, introduced for the sake of compelling\r\namphimixis, is prevented. Minute changes in the chemistry of the ovum,\r\nsimilar to those caused artificially in the ova of the sea-urchin by\r\nthe introduction of an infinitesimal quantity of chloride of magnesium\r\n(Loeb), in the ovum of the silk-moth by friction or by sulphuric acid\r\n(Tichomiroff), or in the sea-urchin ovum by an extract of the sperm of\r\nthe same animal (H. Winkler), will effect this modification, and normal\r\nparthenogenesis is induced.\r\n\r\nFor the ovum, therefore, amphimixis is certainly not a life-renewing or\r\nrejuvenating factor; it only appears as such because the process has\r\nin the course of nature been made compulsory by making the two uniting\r\ncells each incapable of developing by itself. As we have seen, this is\r\ntrue also of the sperm-cell, for although it contains a centrosphere,\r\nand would be capable of division as far as that is concerned, yet in\r\nalmost all animals and plants it consists of such a minimal quantity\r\nof living matter that it is unable to build up a new multicellular\r\norganism by itself. Only in one alga (_Ectocarpus siliculosus_) has\r\nit been observed that not only the female germ-cell can develop\r\nparthenogenetically under certain circumstances, but that the male-cell\r\nmay also do so. In this case, however, the difference in size between\r\nthe two is not great, and it is noteworthy that the male plant, in\r\ncorrespondence with the smaller size of the zoosperm, tends to be a\r\nsomewhat poorly developed organism.\r\n\r\nIf we are forced to the conclusion in regard to multicellular organisms\r\nthat amphimixis does not supply the power of development to the ovum,\r\nbut that, on the contrary, the power of development is withdrawn\r\nfrom the ovum, so that amphimixis can, so to speak, be forced, must\r\nwe not assume something similar for unicellular organisms also? May\r\nnot amphimixis be made compulsory in their case also, in that the\r\nInfusorians in preparation for conjugation go through changes which\r\nmake their unlimited persistence possible only on condition that\r\nthey conjugate? In my opinion the division of labour in the nucleus,\r\nwhich is differentiated into a macronucleus and a micronucleus, and\r\nthe transitory nature of the former, may be regarded as an adaptation\r\nin this direction. In any case, it is striking that an organ which\r\notherwise persists without limit among unicellular organisms, the\r\nnucleus, is here subject to natural death after the manner of the body\r\nof multicellular organisms, that it breaks up and must be reformed\r\nfrom the micronucleus which in this case is alone endowed with\r\npotential immortality. I am inclined to regard this as an arrangement\r\nfor compelling conjugation, since it is only after conjugation that\r\nthe micronucleus forms a new macronucleus, although the latter\r\nis indispensable to life, as we see from experiments in dividing\r\nInfusorians artificially.\r\n\r\nSuppose we had to create the world of life, and it was said to us that\r\namphimixis must--wherever possible--be secured periodically to all\r\nunicellular and multicellular organisms, what better could we do than\r\narrange devices which should exclude individuals which, by chance or\r\nconstitution, could not attain to amphimixis from the possibility of\r\nfurther life? But would amphimixis then be the cause of persistence or\r\na principle of rejuvenescence?\r\n\r\nI do not see that there can be any ground for such an assumption\r\nother than the tenacious and probably usually unconscious adherence\r\nto the inherited and deep-rooted idea of the dynamic significance\r\nof 'fertilization,' no longer, perhaps in its original form, which\r\nregarded the sperm as the vital spark which awakened new life in the\r\ndead ovum, but in the modified form of the 'rejuvenating' power of\r\namphimixis.\r\n\r\nQuite recently an attempt has been made to modify the idea of the\r\n'rejuvenating' effect of amphimixis so that it should mean only\r\nan advantage, not an actual condition of persistence. Hartog, in\r\nparticular, admits so much, that the occurrence of purely asexual and\r\npurely parthenogenetic reproduction excludes the possibility of our\r\nregarding the process of amphimixis as a condition of the maintenance\r\nof life. But then we must also cease to regard the 'ageing' and dying\r\noff of Infusorians which have been prevented from conjugating as an\r\noutcome of the primary constitution of the living substance, and should\r\nentirely abandon the misleading expression 'rejuvenescence.'\r\n\r\nIf we fix our attention on the numberless kinds of cells in higher\r\norganisms and on multicellular organisms as intact unities, we see that\r\nthey all die off, that they are subject to a natural death, that is, a\r\ncessation of vital movement from internal causes, yet no one is likely\r\nto refer their transitoriness to the fact that they do not enter into\r\namphimixis. We find it quite 'intelligible' that the cells of our body\r\nshould be used up sooner or later as a result of their own function,\r\nthough we are very far from being able to demonstrate the necessity for\r\nthis, and so really to 'understand' it.\r\n\r\nIt is only from the standpoint of utility that we can understand the\r\noccurrence of natural death; we see that the germ-cells _must_ be\r\npotentially immortal like the unicellular organisms, but that the\r\ncells which make up the tissues of the body _may_ be transient, and\r\nindeed _must_ be so in the interests of their differentiation--often\r\ngreat and in one direction--which determines the services they render\r\nto the body. They required to become so differentiated that they\r\ncould not continue to live on without limit, and they did become so\r\ndifferentiated because only thus could an ever-increasing functional\r\ncapacity of the whole organism be rendered possible; but they die not\r\nbecause 'rejuvenescence through amphimixis is denied them, but because\r\ntheir physical constitution is what it is.' And we must explain the\r\ndeath of the whole many-celled individual in a similar way. When we\r\nwere trying in a previous study to establish the unlimited continuance,\r\nthe potential immortality, of unicellular organisms, we noted that an\r\neternal continuance of the life of the body of multicellular organisms\r\ncould certainly not be a necessity, since the continuance of these\r\nforms of life is secured by their germ-cells. A continuance of the\r\nbody cannot even be regarded as useful from any point of view. And\r\nwhat is not useful for a form of life _does not arise as a lasting\r\nadaptation_, which is of course not to say that an immortality of\r\nmulticellular organisms, such as they are now, would even have been\r\npossible. If these organisms were to attain to such a high degree of\r\nfunctional capacity and of structural complexity as they now exhibit,\r\nthey obviously could not also have been adapted at the same time to an\r\neternal persistence of life.\r\n\r\nThis is in perfect harmony with our whole conception of the impelling\r\nforces in the development of the organic world; the ever-increasing\r\nfunctional capacity of the structure arose from the advantage which\r\nthis afforded in the struggle for existence, in comparison with which\r\nthe apparent advantage of the endless life of the individual was of no\r\naccount whatever.\r\n\r\nI will not here follow out this idea. I have merely touched on it in\r\norder to make clear that the death of individuals in all multicellular\r\norganisms gives us no ground for thinking of the unlimited life of\r\nthe germ-cells as dependent on a special artifice of nature, such as\r\namphimixis is often supposed to be. Let us always remember that there\r\nis parthenogenesis, and that there are unicellular germs (spores)\r\nwhich are never fertilized, and that the reproduction of many species\r\nof animals and plants occurs in this way without the intervention of\r\namphimixis at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAttempts have recently been made to prove that parthenogenesis is\r\na kind of self-fertilization, and these have been based on the\r\nobservations of Blochmann and Brauer, which showed that in the bee and\r\nin the salt-water Crustacean, _Artemia salina_, the reducing second\r\nmaturation division of the ovum-nucleus is not suppressed, but is\r\nregularly accomplished, and that the two daughter-nuclei which result\r\nfrom this division unite with each other subsequently. I have already\r\nnoted that these statements do not hold true, at least with regard to\r\nthe bee. In this case the second maturing division takes place without\r\nany subsequent fusion of the two daughter-nuclei. According to the\r\nobservations of Dr. Petrunkewitsch, which I have already mentioned, and\r\nfor the exactness of which I can vouch, the second maturation-spindle\r\nis unusually long, so that the two daughter-nuclei are pushed very far\r\napart (Fig. 79, _Rsp 2_), and only the inner of the two nuclei (_K 4_)\r\nbecomes a segmentation nucleus, while the outer undergoes a remarkable\r\nfate; it unites with the inner nucleus which results from the division\r\nof the _first maturation cell_ (_K 2_), and from this union the\r\nprimitive _genital cells of the animal appear to arise_--an observation\r\nthe eventual theoretical importance of which can only be estimated\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nMeantime all we can gain from it is a certain mistrust of the\r\ninterpretation of the processes of maturation in _Artemia_ which have\r\nhitherto been given; at least we are tempted to suppose that the\r\ncopulation of two nuclei which Brauer observed in _Artemia_ may not\r\nhave led to the formation of the segmentation nucleus there either, but\r\nmay have had some other significance.\r\n\r\nBut, even if we leave this point entirely out of account, there\r\nremain all the cases of regular parthenogenesis in which this mode of\r\nreproduction occurs alone and not in alternation with the sexual mode.\r\nIn these only one maturing division is undergone, and only one polar\r\nbody is formed, and thus there can lie no possibility of supposing a\r\nself-fertilization of the ovum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.

Highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that we may yet discover species among unicellular\r\norganisms which multiply without limit in the absence of any\r\namphimixis. R. Hertwig has recently observed phenomena in Infusorians\r\nwhich he is inclined to refer to the suppression of an earlier habit of\r\nconjugation, and so to a kind of parthenogenesis. But even if it should\r\nbe shown that amphimixis plays a part regularly and without exception\r\nin the life of _all_ unicellular organisms, the facts in regard to\r\nmulticellular organisms are not affected; and, finally, the process of\r\namphimixis is one which we have not the slightest ground for assuming\r\nto be either an awakener or a maintainer of life, and so I return\r\nto the most essential part of the whole problem, the meaning of the\r\nchromatin structures, the combination of which is the undoubted result\r\nof amphimixis. Do they really represent, as we assumed earlier, _the\r\nhereditary substance_, and what do we mean by this term?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the literature and the development of biological\r\ntheories, the botanist Nägeli was the first to deduce, from the\r\nconsiderable difference in size between the egg-cell and the\r\nsperm-cell, the conclusion that the material basis on which the\r\nhereditary tendencies depend must be a _minimal_ quantity of\r\nsubstance. The difference is especially great in animals, even in\r\nthose species whose eggs may be called small, for instance, those of\r\nsea-urchins or of mammals; even in these the mass of spermatozoon is\r\nscarcely a thousandth part, often scarcely a hundred-thousandth part\r\nof the mass of the ovum. And yet the inheritance from the father and\r\nfrom the mother is equally great. Now as we know that vital powers\r\nhave always a material basis, a minute quantity, such as is contained,\r\nfor instance, in the spermatozoon of Man, must have implicitly in\r\nit all the hereditary tendencies of the father; and the conclusion\r\nis inevitable that in the ovum there can only be an equally minimal\r\nquantity of substance which is the bearer of the hereditary powers, for\r\nif there were a larger quantity of hereditary substance in the ovum its\r\npower of transmission would also be greater[16].\r\n\r\n[16] The improbable assumption that the hereditary substance of the\r\nfather may be in quality altogether different from that of the mother,\r\nand so may have the same power of transmission, and yet take up much\r\nless room, I leave out of the question altogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. Ovum of Sea-urchin (_Toxopneustes lividus_),\r\nafter E. B. Wilson, _zk_, cell-substance. _k_, nucleus (so-called\r\ngerminal vesicle). _n_, nucleolus (so-called germinal spot). Below\r\nthere is a spermatozoon of the same animal (_sp_), magnified in the\r\nsame proportion, about 750 times.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. Diagram of a spermatozoon. After E. B. Wilson.\r\n_sp_, apex. _n_, nucleus. _c_, centrosphere. _m_, middle portion. _ax_,\r\naxial filament. _e_, terminal filament.]\r\n\r\nIf we inquire as to the part of the spermatozoon which bears this\r\nhereditary substance, we may exclude both the tail-thread and the\r\nmiddle piece (Fig. 68), the former because it obviously fulfils\r\nquite a specialized physiological function and is histologically\r\nadapted to this function, the latter because, from observation on the\r\nspermatozoon which has made its way into the ovum, we know that it\r\ncontains the centrosome, the dividing apparatus of the nucleus. Thus\r\nthere only remains the 'head' of the spermatozoon, which includes the\r\nnucleus, as the possible vehicle of the heritable substance. Therefore\r\nwe are led to seek for the hereditary substance in the nucleus. But\r\nthe hereditary substance cannot be a perishable substance which may\r\nat need be dissolved, in the literal sense of the word, and be formed\r\nanew; therefore we cannot look for it in the nuclear membrane, and just\r\nas little in the 'nuclear sap' which fills the meshes of the nuclear\r\nnetwork, since the material on which heredity depends must necessarily\r\nbe solid. Nägeli has clearly shown that we must assume a stable,\r\nthat is, a solid molecular architecture. There thus remains only the\r\nnuclear reticulum with its chromatin granules, and when we remember\r\nwhat we have learnt of the behaviour of this chromatin substance during\r\ndivision and amphimixis we can entertain no doubt that the sought-for\r\nbearer of the inheritance is contained in the substance of the\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\nThe great care with which the chromosomes are halved by means of the\r\ncomplicated division apparatus led us earlier to regard them as a\r\nsubstance of complex and manifold qualities and of great physiological\r\nimportance; their constant number in any one species, and the reduction\r\nof that number to half by means of the reducing divisions, justify us\r\nin concluding that they are permanent structures, physiological and\r\nmorphological units, which undergo no more than an apparent irregular\r\ndispersion during the resting state of the nucleus. Finally, the fact\r\nthat these supposed vehicles of inheritance occur in equal numbers in\r\neach of the conjugating germ-cells, and that this number is _always_,\r\nboth in animals and in plants, half of the normal number occurring in\r\nsomatic cells, is decisive. The logical necessity that the hereditary\r\nsubstance of both parents should be transmitted to the offspring in\r\nequal quantity could not be more precisely met than it is by the\r\nfact that half the normal number of chromosomes occurs in each of\r\nthe sex-nuclei in the ovum. Personally, I have long been certain, on\r\nthese grounds, that the chromosomes of the nucleus are the hereditary\r\nsubstance, and I expressed my conviction on this point almost\r\nsimultaneously with Strasburger and O. Hertwig[17].\r\n\r\n[17] More precisely, my conclusions were published several months\r\nlater than those of the investigators named (1885). I think, however,\r\nthat no one who is familiar with my writings for the years immediately\r\npreceding, which are collected in _Aufsätzen über Vererbung und\r\nverwandte biologische Fragen_ (Jena, 1892), will dispute that the idea\r\nwas reached by me independently. I attach importance to this because\r\nall my later work is based upon this idea.\r\n\r\nBut there is also a physiological proof of the meaning of the nuclear\r\nsubstance; and this we owe, again, to the simultaneous and independent\r\nresearches of two investigators, M. Nussbaum and A. Gruber, the\r\nlatter working in the Zoological Institute here (in Freiburg), and\r\nat my request. They made experiments on regeneration in unicellular\r\norganisms, and found that Infusorians which were artificially divided\r\ninto two, three, or four pieces were able to build up a whole animal\r\nout of each piece, provided that it contained a portion of the\r\nnucleus (macronucleus). The large blue trumpet-animalcule, _Stentor\r\ncœruleus_, is well suited for such experiments, not only on account of\r\nits size, but because it possesses a very long rosary-like nucleus,\r\nwhich can be easily cut two or three times. When a piece is cut off\r\nwhich does not contain a portion of the nucleus, it may indeed live\r\nfor some days and swim about and contract, but it is incapable of\r\nreconstructing the lost parts, and thus of forming a whole animal, and\r\nit perishes. It is in the nucleus, therefore, that we have to look\r\nfor the substance which stamps the material of the cell-body with a\r\nparticular form and organization, namely, the form and organization\r\nof its ancestors. But that is exactly the conception of a hereditary\r\nsubstance or idioplasm (Nägeli). Some modern biologists deny that there\r\nis any hereditary substance _per se_, and believe that the whole of\r\nthe germ-cell, cell-body and nucleus together effects transmission.\r\nBut though it must be admitted that the nucleus without the cell-body\r\ncannot express inheritance any more than the cell-body without the\r\nnucleus, this is dependent on the fact that the nucleus cannot live\r\nwithout the cell-body; if it be removed from the cell and put, say,\r\ninto water, it bursts and is dissolved. But the cell-body without the\r\nnucleus lives on, though of course only for a few hours or days, and\r\nits metabolism ceases only when it is brought to a standstill by the\r\nfailure to replace by nutrition the used-up material. Thus the argument\r\nused by those who deny the existence of a hereditary substance would be\r\nparalleled if we denied that Man possesses a thinking substance, and\r\nmaintained that he thinks with his whole body, and even that the brain\r\ncannot think by itself without the body.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that it is just as mistaken to maintain that every\r\npart of an organism must contain the hereditary tendencies in the\r\nsame degree, or that in unicellular organisms the cell-body is as\r\nimportant in inheritance as the nucleus (Conklin). If one feels any\r\ndoubt on this point, one has only to call to mind Nägeli's inference,\r\nfrom the minuteness of the spermatozoon, that the hereditary substance\r\nmust be minimal in quantity. But even theoretically there is not the\r\nsmallest ground for the assumption that the cell-body as well as the\r\nnucleus contains the hereditary qualities, since we find in general\r\nthat functions are distributed among definite substances and parts of\r\nthe whole organism, and it is just on this division of labour that\r\nthe whole differentiation of the body depends. And why should this\r\nprinciple not have been employed just here where the most important\r\nof all functions is concerned? Why should all living substance be\r\nhereditary substance? Although Nägeli thought of his 'idioplasm'\r\notherwise than we now think of hereditary substance, although he\r\nwrongly imagined it in the form of strands running a parallel course\r\nthrough the cell-substance and forming a connected reticulum throughout\r\nthe whole body, he recognized at least so much quite correctly,\r\nthat there are two great categories of living substance--hereditary\r\nsubstance or idioplasm, and 'nutritive substance' or trophoplasm, and\r\nthat the former is much smaller in mass than the latter. We now add\r\nto this, that the idioplasm must be sought for in the cell-nucleus,\r\nand indeed in the chromatin granules of the nuclear network and of the\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\nBut incontrovertible proof of the fact that the nuclear substance\r\n_alone_ is the hereditary substance was furnished when it was found\r\npossible to introduce into a non-nucleated piece of a mature ovum of\r\none species the nucleus of another related species, and when it was\r\nseen that the larva that developed from the ovum so treated belonged\r\nto the _second_ species. Boveri made this experiment with the ovum and\r\nspermatozoon of two species of sea-urchin, and believed that he had\r\nsucceeded in getting from non-nucleated pieces of the ovum of the first\r\nspecies, fertilized with the sperm of the second, larvæ of this second\r\nspecies; but, unfortunately, later control-experiments made by several\r\ninvestigators, especially by Seeliger, have shown that this result\r\ncannot be regarded as quite certain and indubitable.\r\n\r\nI must emphasize again that I am far from regarding the cell-protoplasm\r\nof the ovum as an indifferent substance. It is certainly not only\r\nimportant but indispensable for the development of the embryo, and it\r\nhas assuredly its own specific character, as in every other kind of\r\ncell. It represents, so to speak, the matrix and nutritive environment\r\nin which alone the hereditary substance can unfold its wonderful\r\npowers; it has developed historically, like every other kind of cell,\r\nbut it contains nothing more than the inherited qualities of this one\r\nkind of cell-protoplasm, not those of the other cells of the body.\r\n\r\nBut although the essence of fertilization lies, as we have seen, in\r\nthe union of the hereditary substance of two individuals, and not in\r\na 'quickening' of the ovum, we may quite well speak of a quickening by\r\nfertilization in another sense, if we mean the impulse to embryonic\r\ndevelopment, for this is really supplied by the entrance of the\r\nsperm-nucleus with its centrosphere into the ovum. But even this\r\nimpulse can, under certain circumstances, be given in another way,\r\nand certainly the awakening of it is not the _end_ of fertilization,\r\nbut only the condition without which the end, the union of two kinds\r\nof nuclear substance, could not be attained. There is no indication\r\nwhatever that this 'quickening' of the ovum would be necessary for any\r\nother reason except that _the ovum was previously made incapable of\r\ndevelopment_. There would be no 'fertilization' were not the mingling\r\nof hereditary substances of fundamental importance for the organic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMoreover, an ovum, or a fragment of an ovum, may also develop of\r\nitself, having only _one_ of the sex-nuclei, and the union of the\r\nhereditary substance of two cells is therefore not indispensable for\r\nthe mere production of a new individual.\r\n\r\nWhat has been observed in regard to fragments of ova is particularly\r\ninteresting in this connexion. Ernst Ziegler first succeeded in halving\r\na newly fertilized sea-urchin ovum, so that one half contained the\r\nfemale and the other the male pronucleus. The latter alone contained\r\na centrosphere, and developed a blastula larva. Delage carried these\r\nexperiments further, and cut an unfertilized but mature sea-urchin\r\novum into pieces, and then 'fertilized' the non-nucleated pieces with\r\nspermatozoa. These pieces developed and yielded young larvæ of the\r\nrelevant species; so it is clearly seen that even a piece of mature\r\novum-protoplasm may undergo embryonic development, provided that\r\na nucleus furnished with a dividing apparatus penetrates into it.\r\nUnfortunately it is technically impossible to cut such a non-nucleated\r\nand then fertilized fragment of ovum so that one half shall contain\r\nthe male nucleus the other its centrosphere. Even without this\r\n_experimentum crucis_ we may say that the half with the male nucleus\r\nwould not multiply by division, and that the other probably would,\r\nthough it would not go through the regular course of segmentation\r\nprocesses, because the hereditary substance absolutely necessary for\r\nthese was wanting.\r\n\r\nBut these and similar experiments prove something more, namely, that\r\nthe nuclei of the sperm-cell and egg-cell do not, as was formerly\r\nbelieved, stand in a primary and essential contrast to each other,\r\nwhich may be described as male and female, but that both are alike in\r\ntheir deeper essence, and may replace each other. They only differ from\r\neach other as far as the cells to which they belong differ, in this,\r\nnamely, that they are mutually attractive; they find each other and\r\nunite, and then go on to develop, which each was previously unable to\r\ndo by itself. Widely as the sperm-cell and egg-cell differ in size,\r\nconstitution, and behaviour, in regard to essential character they are\r\nalike; they bear the relation--as I expressed it twenty years ago--of\r\n1:1; that is, _they both contain an equal quantity of essentially\r\nsimilar hereditary substance_, and the quality of this substance is\r\nonly individually variable. We should, therefore, speak not of a 'male'\r\nand 'female,' but of a 'paternal' and a 'maternal' nucleus.\r\n\r\nAll the more recent experiments on 'merogony,' that is, on the\r\ndevelopment of fragments of the ovum, confirm this view. Thus Boveri\r\nhad already observed that even small pieces of sea-urchin ova which did\r\nnot contain the nucleus of the ovum developed, after the spermatozoon\r\nhad entered them, into small but otherwise normal larvæ of the species.\r\nMore recently Hans Winkler proved the same thing for the ova of plants,\r\nby dividing the ovum of a marine alga (_Cystosira_) into two pieces,\r\nthen fertilizing these with water containing sperms, with the result\r\nthat he got from both pieces, the nucleated and the non-nucleated, an\r\nembryo of normal appearance. In the latter it could only have been a\r\n'paternal' nucleus which directed the development.\r\n\r\nTo sum up. Our investigation into the meaning of amphimixis has led\r\nus to the conclusion that it consists in the union of two equal\r\ncomplements of hereditary substance, contributed by two different\r\nindividuals, into one unified nucleus, and that the sole immediate\r\nresult of this is _the combination of the hereditary tendencies of two\r\nindividuals in one_. Among multicellular organisms this one individual\r\nof dual origin always implies the beginning of a new life, since\r\namphimixis is indissolubly associated with reproduction, and even\r\namong unicellular organisms it can hardly be disputed that the two\r\nInfusorians which separate after conjugation are no longer the same\r\nas they were before. After amphimixis they must contain a different\r\ncombination of hereditary substance from what they had before, and\r\nthis must reproduce the parts of the animal in a somewhat modified\r\nform. This is theoretically beyond doubt, although it can scarcely be\r\nestablished by observation.\r\n\r\nWe thus know now what 'fertilization' is. Through the labours of the\r\nlast decade the veil has been torn from a mystery of nature which for\r\nthousands of years confronted humanity as unapproachable; a riddle has\r\nbeen solved for the solution of which a few centuries ago men did not\r\neven dare to hope. Not a few have taken part in these labours; some I\r\nhave already named, but it is impossible that I should here mention\r\nall who have shared in the achievement by observation or reflection.\r\nWhoever has helped it on even a single step may say to himself that\r\nhe has taken an active part in bringing about what must be called\r\nessential progress in human knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut in the science of nature every new solution implies the cropping up\r\nof a new riddle, and we are immediately confronted with the problem,\r\nWhy should nature, in the course of evolution, have interpolated this\r\nprocess of the mingling of different hereditary substances almost\r\neverywhere in the organic world? This, however, is a problem which we\r\ncannot attack until we have first made ourselves more fully acquainted\r\nwith the phenomena of inheritance, and have attempted to reason back\r\nfrom these to the nature of the hereditary substance. We must, in\r\nshort, think out a theory of heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XVII\r\n\r\nTHE GERM-PLASM THEORY\r\n\r\n Conception of the 'id' deduced from the process of\r\n fertilization--Hereditary substance, 'idioplasm' and\r\n 'germ-plasm'--'Idants'--Evolution or Epigenesis--Herbert Spencer's\r\n uniform germinal substance--Determinants--Illustrations: _Lycæna\r\n agestis_--The leaf-butterflies--Insect metamorphosis, limbs of\r\n segmented animals--Heterotopia--The ultimate living units or\r\n biophors--Number of determinants--Stridulating organ of the\r\n grasshopper.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN proceeding to expound the theory of heredity which has shaped itself\r\nin my mind in the course of my own scientific development, I should\r\nlike to begin by pointing out that the hereditary substance of the\r\ngerm-cell of an animal or of a plant contains not only the primary\r\nconstituents (_Anlagen_) of a single individual of the species, but\r\nrather those of several, often even of many individuals. That this is\r\nso can be proved in several ways.\r\n\r\nI start from what I hold to be the proved proposition, that the\r\nchromatin substance of the nucleus is the hereditary substance. We\r\nhave seen that this is present in the germ-cells of every species in\r\nthe form of a definite number of chromosomes, and that in germ-cells\r\ndestined for fertilization, that is, in sex-cells, this number is first\r\nreduced to half, the reduction being effected, as is now proved in\r\nregard to a whole series of animals, by the two last cell-divisions,\r\nthe so-called maturation divisions.\r\n\r\nWe know that the full number is only reached again through amphimixis,\r\nby which process the half number of chromosomes in the male and female\r\ngerm-cells are united in a single cell, the 'fertilized ovum,' and in a\r\nsingle nucleus, the so-called segmentation nucleus. Thus the hereditary\r\nsubstance of the child is formed half from the paternal, half from the\r\nmaternal hereditary substance, and we have seen that this remains so\r\nduring the whole development of the child, since, at every succeeding\r\ncell-division each of the paternal and each of the maternal chromosomes\r\ndoubles by dividing, and the resulting halves are distributed between\r\nthe two daughter-nuclei.\r\n\r\nNow if the complete hereditary substance of a germ-cell before the\r\nreducing divisions contains potentially all the primary constituents\r\nof the body, which it does as a matter of course, then it follows that\r\nafter the reduction each germ-cell must either contain only half the\r\nprimary constituents of the parents or all the primary constituents\r\nmust be contained in the half number of chromosomes. The latter seems\r\nto me the only possible assumption, as I shall immediately proceed to\r\nshow, and this is as much as to say that the primary constituents of at\r\nleast two complete individuals must be contained in the chromosomes of\r\nthe segmentation nucleus.\r\n\r\nThat this conclusion is correct is obvious from the fact that a whole,\r\nthat is, a perfect individual with all its parts, develops from the\r\novum, and not a defective one. For suppose that each mature germ-cell\r\ncontained only half the primary constituents of the body, it would be\r\nimpossible that these halves should always exactly complete themselves\r\nto form a whole embryo when they are brought together in fertilization,\r\nafter having been halved by mere chance during the preceding reducing\r\ndivision; it would be much more likely to happen that they did not\r\ncomplete themselves, and that their union would therefore result\r\nin an individual with certain parts wanting. If, for instance, in\r\nthe sperm-cell only the anterior half of the body was potentially\r\npresent, and this united with an ovum which likewise contained only\r\nthe primary constituents of the anterior half, the embryo resulting\r\nfrom their union would lack the posterior half of the body, and so\r\non. Of course so rough a division of the primary constituents is not\r\nto be thought of, but however fine we can imagine the halving of the\r\nmass of primary constituents to be, there would never be any guarantee\r\nthat the two cells uniting in amphimixis would complete the mass of\r\nprimary constituents again; indeed, the chance that the two exactly\r\ncomplementary halves of the mass would meet would rather become less\r\nthe finer and more complex one imagines the halving by reducing\r\ndivisions to be. A perfect embryo with all its parts would rarely\r\narise, but now one group of parts, now another would be wanting, while\r\nanother group might be developed double, or at least would be doubly\r\npresent in the primary constituents.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to this the facts of inheritance show us that the\r\nresemblance to mother and father may express itself simultaneously\r\nin all the parts, or at least in the same parts of the child, as may\r\nbe seen with especial clearness among plant-hybrids, and thus the\r\nconclusion is inevitable that even in the half number of chromosomes\r\nall the primary constituents of the whole body are present.\r\n\r\nLet us go a generation further. If the species possess four\r\nchromosomes the child will have in its cells two maternal chromosomes\r\n(_A_) and two paternal chromosomes (_B_); what form will this\r\nproportion take in the germ-cells produced by the child? The maturation\r\ndivision can effect the reduction to two chromosomes in different ways;\r\nthere may, for instance, be two paternal chromosomes (_B_) left in the\r\none, and two maternal chromosomes (_A_) in the other daughter-cell, or\r\none paternal (_B_) and one maternal (_A_) in the one, and a similar\r\ncombination in the other cell. Let us follow the latter case further.\r\nA sperm-cell which contained the combination _A_ and _B_ might meet\r\nin amphimixis with an egg-cell of different origin also containing a\r\nsimilar combination of chromosomes, let us say a chromosome _C_ from\r\nthe mother, and a chromosome _D_ from the father. We should then have\r\nin the segmentation nucleus of the fertilized ovum four different\r\nchromosomes, each of which contained the hereditary substance of one\r\ngrandparent; we should have the four chromosomes, _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_,\r\nas the hereditary substance of the grandchild.\r\n\r\n_But since, as we have seen, the halved hereditary substance still\r\ncontains the whole mass of primary constituents, each one of these\r\nchromosomes must contain the collective primary constituents of the\r\nwhole body of the relevant grandparent_[18]. _The hereditary substance\r\nin the fertilized ovum thus consists of several complexes of primary\r\nconstituents (chromosomes) each of which (an 'id') comprises within\r\nitself all the primary constituents of a complete individual._\r\n\r\n[18] When I say the 'collective' primary constituents of the whole body\r\nof the grandparent this is not expressing it quite precisely, for, as\r\nwe shall see later, each individual must arise from the co-operation\r\nof different chromosomes of different origin, not merely from one of\r\nthe chromosomes contained in its germ-plasm. In the example given\r\nabove, the body of each grandparent cannot have arisen only from\r\na single chromosome, which was transmitted to his grandchild, but\r\nfrom the co-operation of this chromosome with three others, which\r\nhave distributed themselves along other genealogical paths. But this\r\ndoes not affect the above chain of reasoning, for here it is not a\r\nquestion of whether all the primary constituents of the grandparent\r\nare present in the child--that can never be the case--but whether the\r\nprimary constituents transmitted by him represent the whole body of an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nIt can be made clear in yet another way that, as a consequence of\r\nsexual reproduction, the germ-plasm of each species must be composed\r\nof several 'ids,' _individually different_. Let us assume that there\r\nwas as yet no amphimixis, and that we could look on at its introduction\r\ninto the organic world; the hereditary substance of the beings which\r\nhad previously lived and multiplied by division would consist of\r\nmore or less numerous chromosomes similar to each other, so that,\r\nfor instance, each individual would contain sixteen identical 'ids.'\r\nBut if amphimixis were now to take place for the first time, in the\r\nsame manner as it does to-day--that is, after the reduction of the\r\nnumber of the ids to half--in the first amphimixis eight paternal\r\nids would unite with eight maternal ids to form the germ-plasm of the\r\nnew individual, as is indicated in Fig. 87 by a circle of spheres,\r\nof which ten are white and ten black as a sign of their difference.\r\nWe may think of the figure as representing the 'equatorial plate'\r\nof a nuclear spindle with its ids arranged in a circle. Now, if\r\ntwo organisms of this generation, with two kinds of ids, unite in\r\namphimixis after previous reduction of the ids, we have figure _B_,\r\nin which the paternal ids (_pJ_) are seen to the left of the line and\r\nthe maternal ids (_mJ_) to the right, while each semicircle is in its\r\nturn made up of two kinds of ids, those of the grandparents (_p_^2_J_\r\nand _m_^2_J_, _p_^2_J_^1 and _m_^2_J_^1). The figures _C_ and _D_ show\r\nthe two following generations, in which the number of identical ids is\r\neach time reduced to half, because eight strange ids are again mingled\r\nwith them; in _C_ only two ids are still identical, and in _D_ all the\r\nids are individually different, because they have come from different\r\nancestors of the same species. Of course this would only be the case\r\nif inbreeding were excluded, because through it the ids of the same\r\nforefathers from two or more sides would meet; but prolonged inbreeding\r\nis a rare exception in free nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87. Diagram to illustrate the operation of\r\namphimixis on the composition of the germ-plasm out of diverse\r\nancestral plasms or 'ids.' _A_-_D_, the ids of the germ-plasm of\r\nfour successive generations: _A_, consisting of only two kinds of\r\nids; _B_, of four; _C_, of eight; _D_, of sixteen kinds. _pJ_ and\r\n_mJ_, paternal and maternal ids. _p_^2_J_, grandpaternal; _p_^3_J_,\r\ngreat-grandpaternal; _p_^4_J_, great-great-grandpaternal ids. The marks\r\nin the ids themselves indicate their individually distinct characters.]\r\n\r\nI shall now call the hereditary substance of a cell its 'idioplasm,'\r\nafter Nägeli's example, although he sought it in the cell-substance,\r\nnot in the nucleus, and had a different theoretical conception of its\r\nmode of action. It was he, however, who conceived and established\r\nthe idea of the idioplasm as the bearer of the primary constituents,\r\nan _Anlagensubstanz_, determining the whole structure of the\r\norganism in contrast to the general nutritive protoplasm. Every cell\r\ncontains idioplasm, since every cell-nucleus contains chromatin,\r\nbut I call the idioplasm of the germ-cells _germ-plasm_, or the\r\nprimary-constituent-substance of the whole organism, and the complexes\r\nof primary constituents necessary to the production of a complete\r\nindividual--whose presence we have just shown to be theoretically\r\nnecessary--I call _ids_. In many cases these 'ids' might be synonymous\r\nwith chromosomes, at least in all the cases in which the chromosomes\r\nare simple, that is, are not composed of several similarly formed\r\nstructures. Thus in the salt-water Crustacean, _Artemia salina_,\r\nwhich possesses 168 minute granular chromosomes, each of these\r\nchromosomes must be regarded as an id, for each can in certain\r\ncircumstances be thrown out from the ovum by the reducing division,\r\nor it can be brought into the most various combinations with other\r\nchromosomes by fertilization. Each of them must therefore consist of\r\nperfect germ-plasm in the sense that all the parts of an individual\r\nare virtually contained in it; _each is a biological unity, an id_.\r\nBut when we see in many animals larger band-shaped or rod-shaped\r\n'chromosomes,' and when these are composed of a series of granules, as\r\nthey are, for instance, in the often mentioned _Ascaris megalocephala_,\r\neach of these granules is to be regarded as an id. In point of fact,\r\nwe find, instead of the two or four large rod-shaped chromosomes\r\nof _Ascaris megalocephala_, a larger number of smaller spherical\r\nchromosomes in other species of _Ascaris_.\r\n\r\nCompound chromosomes consisting of several ids, such as all rod or\r\nband-like elements of the nuclear substance probably are, I designate\r\n'idants.' That they are composed of several individual ids is not\r\nalways clearly apparent because of the smallness of the object, and\r\neven in larger ones this may only be seen in certain stages. Thus\r\nwe have in Fig. 88, _A_ and _B_, two 'mother-sperm-cells' of the\r\nsalamander; _A_ at an earlier stage, in which the individual ids are\r\nnot visible; _B_ at a later stage, in which the band has split, and\r\nthe rosary-like structure has become at once apparent. It is not\r\npossible, then, to see at once whether each chromosome corresponds to\r\none or to several ids. A more exact investigation of the processes\r\nof reducing division has shown that there are chromosomes of simple\r\nspherical form, that is, composed of several ids whose 'plurivalence'\r\ncannot be directly recognized, but can only be inferred from their\r\nfurther development; there are bivalent chromosomes of double value\r\nand quadrivalent chromosomes of fourfold value, which we have to think\r\nof as made up of two or four ids. It would lead us too far to go into\r\nthis more precisely, nor does it fall within the scope and intention\r\nof these lectures to inquire into these intimate and still disputed\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe germ-plasm of every species of plant or animal is thus composed\r\nof a larger or smaller number of ids or primary constituents of an\r\nindividual, and it is through the co-operation of these that the\r\nindividual which develops from the ovum is determined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88. Sperm-mother-cells (spermatocytes) of the\r\nsalamander. _A_, cross-section of the cell in the aster-stage; the\r\nchromosomes (_chr_) or idants do not reveal that they are compounded\r\nout of many ids, which are, however, quite distinctly seen in\r\n_B_ (_Jd_), where the chromosomes or idants (_chr_) are already\r\nlongitudinally split. _zk_, cell-substance. _csp_, centrosome. _c_,\r\ncentrosome in division. After Hermann and Drüner.]\r\n\r\nWe have further to inquire what conception we can form of the\r\nconstitution of an id and of its mode of operation. I have already\r\nspoken of 'primary constituents' (_Anlagen_) of which the germ-plasm\r\nconsists, but what right have we to think of the parts of an animal as\r\nalready contained in the germ in any form whatever? Is it not equally\r\npossible that the germ consists of parts, none of which bear any\r\ndefinite relation in advance to the parts of the finished animal? Might\r\nnot the germ-cell, along with its nucleus, undergo transformations and\r\nregular changes which would successively give rise to new conditions,\r\nnamely, the different stages of development, until finally the complete\r\nanimal was attained?\r\n\r\nWe stand here before an old problem, before the two opposed\r\ninterpretations--the theory of 'Evolution' and the theory of\r\n'Epigenesis,' which were first ranged against each other long ago, and\r\nwhich are a cause of strife even now, although in somewhat different\r\nguise.\r\n\r\nThe theory of 'Evolution' is especially associated with the name of\r\nBonnet, who elaborated it in detail in the eighteenth century. It\r\nmaintains that the development of the ovum to the perfect animal is not\r\nreally a new creation, but only an unfolding of invisible small parts,\r\nwhich were already present in the ovum. It assumes that the parts of\r\nthe perfect organism are already preformed in the ovum, and on this\r\naccount it is called the 'Preformation Theory.' Bonnet often speaks\r\nof the preformation of the perfect animal in the germ as a 'miniature\r\nmodel,' although his conception of 'evolution' was not really so crude\r\nas has been often alleged. He expressly emphasized that this miniature\r\nmodel was not exactly like the perfect animal, but consisted of\r\n'elementary parts' only, which he thought of as a net whose meshes were\r\nfilled up during development and by means of nutrition with an infinite\r\nnumber of other parts. But after all, his conceptions, and those of his\r\ntime generally, were very far removed from the biological thinking of\r\nour own day, as may perhaps be most readily understood when I mention\r\nthat he regarded death and decay as an 'involution,' as a folding back,\r\nso to speak, by means of which all the parts gained though nutrition\r\nwere removed again, so that the net of the miniature model shrank\r\ntogether to the invisible minuteness that it had in the ovum. So it\r\nremained, he fancied, till it was reawakened at the resurrection,\r\nusing the term in the religious sense! He afterwards dropped this\r\nfancy, because the objection was made to it that human beings who had\r\nlost a leg or an arm in this life would necessarily be maimed at the\r\nresurrection!\r\n\r\nIn Bonnet's time the facts of development were quite unknown, and\r\nnot even the stages of the development of the chick from the egg had\r\nbeen observed. When this was afterwards done the prevalent theory\r\nof 'evolution' necessarily collapsed, for men saw with their own\r\neyes that a miniature model of the chick did not gradually grow into\r\nvisibility and ultimately into the young chick, but that first of all\r\nparts showed themselves in the egg which bore no resemblance at all\r\nto the chick, that these first rudiments were then altered, and that\r\nthrough continual new formations and transformations the chick finally\r\nappeared. Upon this K. von Wolff based his theory of 'Epigenesis,' or\r\ndevelopment through new formations and transformations. He maintained\r\nthat the doctrine of 'Evolutio' was false; that there is no miniature\r\nmodel invisibly contained within the egg; but that from the simple\r\negg-substance there arises, through the agency of the formative powers\r\ninherent in it, a long series of stages of development, of which each\r\nsucceeding one is more complex than the one before, until ultimately\r\nthe perfect animal is reached.\r\n\r\nThis certainly marked considerable progress, for it meant the\r\nbeginning of a science of embryology, that is, the science of the\r\nform-development of the animal or plant from the ovum. The result was\r\nnot so important in its theoretical aspect, for though the knowledge\r\nhad been gained that the young animal goes through a long series of\r\ndifferent stages, it had not been discovered how nature works this\r\nwonder and causes an animal of complex structure to arise from the\r\napparently simple substance of the ovum. A solution of the difficulty\r\nwas found by attributing to the ovum a formative power, afterwards\r\ncalled by Blumenbach the _nisus formativus_, which possessed the\r\ncapacity of developing a complex animal from the simple 'slime,' or, as\r\nwe should say, the simple protoplasm.\r\n\r\nIf we contrast the strictly theoretical part of the two theories, we\r\nfind that Bonnet regarded the ovum as something only apparently simple,\r\nbut in reality almost as complex as the animal which developed from it,\r\nand that he thought of the latter, not as being formed anew, but as\r\nbeing unfolded or evolved. That is to say, he thought that rudiments\r\npresent from the outset in the ovum gradually revealed themselves and\r\nbecame visible. Wolff, on the other hand, regarded the ovum as being\r\nwhat it seemed, something quite simple, out of which only the _nisus\r\nformativus_ could, by a series of transformations and new formations,\r\nbuild up a new organism of the relevant species.\r\n\r\nWolff's Epigenesis routed Bonnet's theory so completely from the\r\nfield that, until quite recently, epigenesis was regarded as the only\r\nscientifically justifiable theory, and a return to the 'evolutionist'\r\nposition would have been looked upon as a retrograde step, as a\r\nreversion to a period of fancy which had been happily passed. I myself\r\nhave been repeatedly told, with regard to my own 'evolutionistic'\r\ntheory, that the correctness of epigenesis was indisputably\r\nestablished, that is, was a fact, verifiable at any time by actual\r\nobservation!\r\n\r\nBut what are the facts? Surely only that there is a succession of\r\nnumerous developmental stages, which we know very precisely in the\r\ncase of a great many animals, and that the miniature model which\r\nBonnet assumed to be in the egg does not exist. Both these facts\r\nare now no longer called in question. But that does not furnish us\r\nwith a theory of development, for theory is not the observation of\r\nphenomena or of a series of phenomena, _it is the interpretation of\r\nthem_. Epigenesis, as formulated first by Aristotle and again by\r\nHarvey, Wolff, and Blumenbach, certainly offered an interpretation of\r\ndevelopment, not, however, by referring only to what was observable,\r\nbut by going far beyond it; on the one hand taking the _appearance_ of\r\na homogeneous germ-substance for reality, and, on the other, assuming\r\na special power, which caused a heterogeneous organism to arise from a\r\nhomogeneous germ.\r\n\r\nWe cannot now accept either of these assumptions, for we know that the\r\ngerm-substance is not homogeneous, and indeed is not merely a substance\r\nbut a living cell of complex structure; and we no longer believe\r\nin a special vital force, and therefore not in a special 'power of\r\ndevelopment,' which could only be a modification of the former. We are\r\nthus as little able to accept the old epigenesis as the old evolution,\r\nand we must establish a theory of Development and Heredity on a new\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nWhat this basis must be is in a general way beyond doubt. Since it\r\nis the endeavour of the whole of modern biology to interpret life\r\nmore and more through the interactions of the physical and chemical\r\nforces bound up with matter, development, too, comes within this aim,\r\nfor development is an expression of life. We seek to understand the\r\nmechanism of life, and, as a part of that, the mechanism of development\r\nand of heredity which is closely associated with it.\r\n\r\nIf we wished to attack the problem of heredity at its roots we\r\nshould first of all have to try to understand the process of life\r\nitself as a series of physico-chemical sequences. Perhaps this will\r\nbe achieved up to a certain point in the future, but if we were to\r\nwait for this we should in the meantime have to abandon all attempts\r\nat a theoretical interpretation of the phenomena of development and\r\nheredity, and might indeed have to postpone them to the Greek Kalends.\r\nThat would be as though, in the practice and theory of medicine, all\r\ninvestigation into and speculation regarding disease had to wait until\r\nthe normal, healthy processes of life were thoroughly understood. In\r\nthat case we should now know nothing of bacteria diseases and the\r\nhundred other acquisitions of pathological science: physiology too\r\nwould have remained far behind its present level if it had lacked the\r\nfruitful influence of experience in cases of disease, and the ideas\r\nand theories, true and false, which have been based thereon. In the\r\nsame way we require a theory of development and heredity if we are to\r\npenetrate deeper into these phenomena, and must have it in spite of the\r\nfact that we are still very far from having a complete causal knowledge\r\nof the processes of life. For the raw material of observation, which\r\nis to some extent fortuitous, will never bring us any further on;\r\nobservation must be guided by an idea, and thus directed towards a\r\nparticular goal.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, quite possible to leave aside for the present all\r\nattempts at an explanation of life, and simply to take the elements of\r\nlife for granted, and on this basis to build up a theory of heredity.\r\nWe have already taken a step in that direction by establishing that\r\nthe whole substance of the fertilized ovum does not take part in\r\nheredity in the same degree, but that only a small part, the chromatin\r\nof the nucleus, is to be looked upon as the bearer of the hereditary\r\nqualities, and by deducing, further, that this chromatin is made\r\nup of a varying number of small but still visible units, the ids,\r\neach of which virtually represents the whole organism, or, as I have\r\nalready expressed it, each of which contains within itself, as primary\r\nconstituents, all the parts of a perfect animal.\r\n\r\nIt was these 'primary constituents' which led us to the digression in\r\nregard to Bonnet's theory of 'Evolutio' and Wolff's 'Epigenesis.'\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire what must be the constitution of such a chromatin\r\nglobule, an id, so that, shut up within the nucleus of a living\r\nreproductive cell, it can direct the development of a new organism\r\nwhich resembles its parent. Two fundamental assumptions present\r\nthemselves, and these can be related to every conception of a\r\n'germ-plasm,' even independently of the assumption of ids. Either we\r\nmay think of the id as made up of similar or of different kinds of\r\nparts, none of which has any constant relation to the parts of the\r\nperfect animal, or we think of it as composed of a mass _of different\r\nkinds of parts, each of which bears a relation to a particular part\r\nof the perfect animal_, and so to some extent represents its 'primary\r\nconstituents' (_Anlagen_), although there may be no resemblance\r\nbetween these 'primary constituents' and the finished parts. The\r\nassumption of a germ-plasm composed of similar parts, which has\r\nbeen made, for instance, by Herbert Spencer, may be called the\r\nmodern form of epigenesis, while the other assumption is the modern\r\nform of the 'evolution' theory. As the former theory can no longer\r\ncall to its aid a 'formative power' as a _Deus ex machina_, it can\r\nonly explain development as induced by the influence of external\r\nconditions--temperature, air, water, gravity, position of parts--upon\r\nthe chemical components of the germ-plasm, which are everywhere\r\nuniformly mingled; and it makes no difference whether this uniform\r\ngerm-plasm is thought of as composed of many different kinds of parts,\r\nas long as those parts are mingled uniformly to make the germ-plasm\r\nand bear no relation to definite parts of the developing animal.\r\nOscar Hertwig has recently outlined such a theory. Although I cannot\r\nexpound it here I must say at least so much with regard to it, and to\r\nall other theories of development founded on a similar basis, that\r\nthey could not be accepted even if they were able to offer a workable\r\nexplanation of the development of the individual, and for this reason,\r\nthat ontogeny is not an isolated phenomenon which can be interpreted\r\nwithout reference to the whole evolution of the living world, for it\r\nis most intimately associated with this, being indeed a piece of it,\r\nhaving, as we shall see, arisen from it, and, furthermore, preparing\r\nfor its continued progress. _Ontogeny must be explained in harmony\r\nwith phylogeny and on the same principles._ The assumption of a\r\ngerm-plasm without primary constituents, or of a completely homogeneous\r\ngerm-plasm, as Herbert Spencer maintained, is irreconcilable with this,\r\nfor, as will be seen, it contradicts certain facts of inheritance and\r\nvariation. Therefore all theories founded on this assumption must be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nThere is another and, I believe, weighty consideration which forbids us\r\nto assume a germ-substance without primary constituents. I shall return\r\nto this later, but in the meantime I wish to build up more completely\r\nmy own 'germ-plasm' theory.\r\n\r\nI assume that the germ-plasm consists of a large number of different\r\nliving parts, each of which stands in a definite relation to particular\r\ncells or kinds of cells in the organism to be developed, that is, they\r\nare 'primary constituents' in the sense that their co-operation in the\r\nproduction of a particular part of the organism is indispensable, the\r\npart being _determined_ both as to its existence and its nature by the\r\npredestined particles of the germ-plasm. I therefore call these last\r\n_Determinants_ (_Bestimmungsstücke_), and the parts of the complete\r\norganism which they determine _Determinates_, or hereditary parts.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show on what basis this assumption rests; the phenomena\r\nof inheritance taken in conjunction with those of variation seem to\r\nme to compel us to it. We know that all the parts of an organism are\r\nvariable, and that in one individual the same part may be larger, in\r\nanother smaller. Not all variations are transmissible, but many of\r\nthem, and some very minute ones, are. Thus, for instance, in many human\r\nfamilies there occurs a small pit, hardly as large as the head of a\r\npin, in the skin of the ear, whose transmission I have observed from\r\nthe grandmother to the son and to several grandchildren. In such a case\r\nthere must be a minute something in the germ-plasm, not present in\r\nthat of other human beings, which causes the origin, in the course of\r\ndevelopment, of this little abnormality in the skin.\r\n\r\nThere are human families in which individuals occur repeatedly,\r\nand through several generations, who have a white lock of hair, in\r\na particular spot, on an otherwise dark-haired head. This cannot be\r\nreferred to external influences, it must depend on a difference in\r\nthe germ, on one, too, which does not affect the whole body, not even\r\nall the hairs of the body, but only those of a particular spot on the\r\nsurface of the head. It is a matter of indifference whether the white\r\ncolouring of the hair-tuft is produced by an abnormal constitution of\r\nthe matrix of the hair, or by other histological elements of the skin,\r\nas of the blood-vessels or nerves. It can only depend ultimately on a\r\ndivergently constituted part of the germ-plasm, which can only affect\r\nthis one spot on the head, and alter it, if it is itself different from\r\nwhat is usual. On this account I call _it_ the _determinant_ of the\r\nrelevant skin-spot and hair-group. In Man such minute local variations\r\nare usually lost after a number of generations, but in animals there\r\nare innumerable phenomena which prove to us that single minute\r\ndeviations can become permanent. Thus there lives in Central Europe a\r\nbrown 'blue butterfly,' _Lycæna agestis_, which has a little black spot\r\nin the middle of its wing. The same species also occurs in Scotland,\r\nbut there, instead of the black spot, it has a milk-white one, and\r\nso-called 'eye-spots' on the under surface of the wing have also\r\nlost their black centres. The species has thus varied transmissibly,\r\nbut only in regard to these particular spots on the wing. A slight\r\nvariation must therefore have taken place in the germ-plasm which only\r\naffects these few parts of the body, or, to express it otherwise, the\r\ngerm-plasms of the ancestral species and of the variety can only be\r\ndistinguished by a difference which determines exclusively the scale\r\ncolour of these spots. The two germ-plasms differ, I should say, only\r\nas regards the _determinants_ of these wing-scales.\r\n\r\nWe know from the artificial selection to which Man has subjected and\r\nstill subjects his domesticated animals and useful plants, that any\r\nspots and parts of the body which he chooses can be hereditarily\r\naltered, if the desired variations which present themselves are always\r\nselected for breeding, and that this does not necessarily cause\r\nvariation in other parts of the body. When, for instance, in the case\r\ncited by Darwin, the comb of a Spanish cock which had previously hung\r\ndownwards was made to stand upright because a prize had been offered\r\nfor this character, or when a certain breed of hens was 'furnished with\r\nbeards,' the results were permanent variations affecting only the parts\r\non which the fancier's attention had been fixed. In the same way, when\r\nthe tail feathers of the Japanese cock are lengthened to three feet\r\nthe rest of the plumage does not alter, still less any other part of\r\nthe body. Of course there are numerous 'correlated' variations, and\r\nin very many cases the breeder causes a second or third character, on\r\nwhich he had not fixed his attention, to vary in addition to the one\r\nhe was aiming at. But such concomitant variations are not necessary\r\nor inevitable in all cases; and indeed we need not refer them all to\r\na true correlation of the parts, but may suppose that they depend not\r\ninfrequently on the faultiness of our power of observation, which is\r\nnot sufficiently keen to control several parts of the body at one\r\ntime, and to notice minimal variations in parts on which we have not\r\nspecially fixed our attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. _Kallima paralecta_, from India; showing the\r\nright under surface in the resting pose. _K_, head. _Lt_, palps. _B_,\r\nlimbs. _V_, fore wing. _H_, hind wing. _St_, 'tail' of the latter,\r\nrepresenting the stalk of the leaf. _gl_^1 and _gl_^2, transparent\r\nspots, _Aufl_, remains of 'eye-spots.' _Sch_, a 'mould'-spot.]\r\n\r\nSo much, at least, is certain, that in all these cases of the\r\nartificial alteration of individual characters the germ-plasm is in\r\nsome way changed, but always in such a way that it differs from that\r\nof the ancestral form through such variations alone, and the effect of\r\nthese is that only the altered parts are influenced thereby, and not\r\nthe whole organism. This again is but another way of saying that only\r\nthe _determinants_ of these parts have altered.\r\n\r\nWe can see from a thousand cases that exactly the same happens in a\r\nstate of nature, that there, too, one part changes after another,\r\nuntil the highest possible degree of adaptation to the conditions has\r\nbeen attained. In the mimetic resemblance to leaves exhibited among\r\nbutterflies this is most clearly seen, for here we are familiar with\r\nthe model--the leaf--and we see how one species approximates to it in\r\na general way only in the total colour, how others develop a brown\r\nstripe crossing the posterior wing obliquely, so that, to a certain\r\nextent, it resembles the midrib of a leaf, how in a third species this\r\nstripe is continued for some distance forward across the anterior wing,\r\nin a fourth it goes a little further, until, finally, in a fifth, it\r\nis continued on to the tip of the anterior wing. This may be seen,\r\nfor instance, in the genus _Anæa_, which is rich in species. But even\r\nthen a still further increase of the resemblance is possible, for, as\r\nis well known, there are not infrequently imitations of the lateral\r\nveins of the leaf as well, or dark spots which faithfully reproduce the\r\nmould-spot on a damp, decaying leaf, or colourless transparent spots\r\nwhich probably simulate dewdrops, and so on. All these are variations\r\nrelating to individual and distinct groups of wing-scales, which have\r\nvaried transmissibly and independently, that is, each of them has been\r\nproduced by a variation in the germ-plasm, which brought about a change\r\nin this particular area of the body and in no other.\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment assume the impossible, and suppose that we could\r\nlook on at the evolution of such a leaf-butterfly; the beginning of the\r\nleaf-imitation might have its cause in the fact that an ancestral form\r\nof _Kallima_, which had previously lived in the meadows, exhibited on\r\nthe part of some of its descendants a migration to the woods, and thus\r\ndivided into two groups, with a different manner of life--a meadow form\r\nand a wood form. The latter adapted itself to sitting among leaves, and\r\nthe midrib of a leaf developed on its wings. In a germ-plasm without\r\n'primary constituents' this variation could only depend on a uniform\r\nvariation of all the parts, for these parts are either alike among\r\nthemselves, or at any rate have the same value for every part of the\r\nfinished organism. But the germ-plasm of the new breed must somehow\r\ndiffer from that of the ancestral form, otherwise it could produce no\r\nnew variety, but only the ancestral form over again. But how could\r\nan animal differing only in one minute part arise from a germ-plasm\r\nwhich has varied in all its parts, and how could such little steps of\r\nvariation be repeated many times in the course of the phylogeny without\r\nthe corresponding variations of the germ-plasm becoming so intense\r\nthat not only the wing-markings but everything about the animal would\r\nbe altered likewise? And yet these 'leaf-pictures' have not originated\r\nsuddenly, but by many small steps, so that the germ-plasm must have\r\nvaried _in toto_ a hundred times in succession if there are no primary\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian species, _Kallima paralecta_, there are no fewer than\r\nfive well-marked varieties, the differences between which depend solely\r\non the manner in which the leaf-picture on the wing is elaborated,\r\n_for the upper surface of the wing is alike in all_. Even a cursory\r\nobservation of a collection of these butterflies shows that the lateral\r\nveins of the leaf-picture are quite different in number, distinctness,\r\nand length in the different individuals. On the right half of the wing\r\nthere may be as many as six of them indicated (Fig. 13); and it can\r\nbe observed that the three middle ones are the longest, most sharply\r\ndefined, and darkest, while those lying near the tip and the base of\r\nthe mimic leaf are shorter and often even shadowy. On the left side\r\nthe second lateral vein in particular distinctly shows indentations\r\nindicative of the rings, inherited from the ancestral forms, which\r\nsurrounded the still visible eye-spots (_Aufl_); the third lateral\r\nvein is quite indefinite and shadowy, but nevertheless it runs exactly\r\nparallel to the first two, and thus heightens the deceptive effect. We\r\ncan thus distinguish older and more recent elements in the marking--a\r\nproof of the slow and successive origin of the picture.\r\n\r\nThis is not reconcilable with the conception of a germ-plasm without\r\nprimary constituents, however complex a mixture it may otherwise\r\nbe. A substance which had to undergo thousands upon thousands of\r\nvariations, arising from each other according to law and in the\r\nstrictest succession, in order that it might become a definite\r\norganism, predetermined as to all its thousands of parts down to the\r\nmost minute, cannot vary over and over again in its whole constitution\r\nwithout the consequences showing themselves in numerous, or indeed in\r\n_all_, the parts of the body. Such variations in the germ-plasm would\r\nbe comparable to many successive deviations of a ship from her course,\r\nwhich, although the single ones would only cause a minimal deviation\r\nfrom the true course, would, when summed up in a voyage of some length,\r\nland the vessel at quite another coast than the one intended. If each\r\nindividual adaptation of the species depended on a variation of the\r\nwhole germ-plasm the wood _Kallima_ would soon retain no resemblance\r\nto its ancestral form, the meadow species; yet we are acquainted with\r\nspecies of _Kallima_ which do not show the special resemblance to a\r\nleaf, but, for instance, still exhibit the perfectly developed eye-spot\r\nof the ancestral form, and so forth. It follows, therefore, that the\r\norigin of the leaf-picture has not greatly influenced the general\r\ncharacter of the species; and the fact that the upper surface of the\r\nwings has remained the same in all the varieties is in itself enough to\r\nprove this.\r\n\r\nSince, then, the resemblance to a leaf cannot have arisen without\r\nsomething in the germ-plasm varying, since the germ-plasm of a forest\r\n_Kallima_ and a meadow _Kallima_ must be different in something, and\r\ncannot be any more alike than the germ-plasm of a fantail-pigeon and a\r\ncarrier, there _must be 'primary constituents' in the germ-plasm_, that\r\nis, vital units whose variation occasions the variation of definite\r\nparts of the organism, and of these alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Caterpillar of _Selenia tetralunaria_ on a twig\r\nof birch. _K_, head. _F_, feet. _m_, protuberances resembling dormant\r\nbuds. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nIt is on such considerations as these that my assumption, that _the\r\ngerm-plasm is composed of determinants_, depends. There must be as many\r\nof these as there are regions in the fully-formed organism capable\r\nof independent and transmissible variation, including all the stages\r\nof development. Every part, for instance, of the butterfly's wing,\r\nwhich is capable of independent and transmissible variation, must,\r\nso I conclude, be represented in the germ-plasm by an element which\r\nis likewise variable, the determinant; but the same must be true of\r\nevery independently and transmissibly variable spot of the caterpillar\r\nfrom which the butterfly developed. We know how markedly caterpillars\r\nare adapted in form and colour to their environment. Let us assume\r\nthat the caterpillar of the butterfly which we chose as an example\r\nof wing-marking had the habit of feeding only by night and during\r\nthe daytime of resting on the trunk of a tree, or, more precisely,\r\nin the crevices of the bark. It would then resemble the caterpillar\r\nof the moths of the genus _Catocala_ or the Geometers (Geometridæ),\r\nand possess the colour of the bark of the tree in question; the\r\ndeterminants of the skin would thus have varied to correspond with this\r\nmode of life on the part of the caterpillar, so that the skin would\r\nappear grey or brown. But there cannot be only _one_ determinant of\r\nthe caterpillar skin in the germ-plasm, for the bark-like colour of,\r\nfor instance, a Geometer caterpillar is not a uniform grey, but has\r\ndarker spots at certain places and lighter whitish spots at others,\r\nsuch as are to be seen on the bark of the twig on which the caterpillar\r\nis wont to rest, or brown-red spots, like those on the cover-scales of\r\nthe buds, or little warts and protuberances which exactly correspond\r\nto similar roughnesses on the twigs, to cracks in the bark, and so on.\r\nAll these markings are constant, and are to be found in the same spot\r\nin every caterpillar of the species. A large number of regions of the\r\ncaterpillar skin must therefore be independently determined by the\r\ngerm-plasm; the germ-plasm must contain parts the variations of which\r\nbring about variations only of an independently variable region of the\r\ncaterpillar skin. In other words, in the germ-plasm of the butterfly\r\novum there must not only be determinants for many regions of the\r\nbutterfly's wing, but also for many regions of the caterpillar's skin.\r\n\r\nThis line of argument, of course, applies to all the bodily parts and\r\norgans of the butterfly and of the caterpillar, as well as to all the\r\nstages of development of the species as far as these parts are able\r\nto vary in such a way that the variation reappears in the following\r\ngeneration, that is to say, as far as it is transmissibly variable.\r\n\r\nBut all parts must be transmissibly variable which have exhibited\r\nindependent variation in relation to their ancestors. When, for\r\ninstance, the eggs of a butterfly (_Vanessa levana_) bear a deceptive\r\nresemblance to the flower-buds of the stinging-nettle on which\r\nthe caterpillar lives, not only in form and colour, but in their\r\npillar-like arrangement, we may conclude that these eggs have varied\r\ntransmissibly from those of their ancestors, which had not acquired\r\nthe habit of living on the stinging-nettle, in these three respects\r\nindependently, that is, uninfluenced by any other variations the\r\nspecies may have undergone; and that, consequently, the germ-plasm\r\nmust contain determinants for the egg-shell, egg-colouring, and so\r\non. The manner of laying the eggs in the form of pillars depends on a\r\nmodification of the egg-laying instinct, which must in its turn depend\r\non the variations of certain nerve-centres, and we learn from this that\r\nthere must be in the germ-plasm determinants for the individual centres\r\nof the nervous system.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be suggested that matters could be explained in a\r\nsimpler way--that it is enough to assume the presence in the egg of\r\ndeterminants for all the parts of the caterpillar, and that those of\r\nthe butterfly are only formed within the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion seems justifiable if we confine ourselves to\r\nsuperficial considerations. We read in every handbook of entomology\r\nthat the wings only arise during the life of the caterpillar, and\r\nin a certain sense this is true, for the primary constituents or\r\nprimordia of wings only develop into the fully formed wing during the\r\nlarval period. But even if these primordia were only formed during\r\nthe caterpillar-stage, what could they develop from? Only out of the\r\nmaterial parts of the caterpillar, that is, from some of its living\r\ncells or cell-groups. The constitution of the wings would therefore\r\nbe dependent on that of the cells of the caterpillar from which they\r\narose, so that if these varied transmissibly through the variation\r\nof their determinants contained in the germ, the determinants of the\r\nbutterfly which were just developing would vary with them; every\r\ntransmissible variation of the caterpillar would necessarily cause a\r\nsimilar variation in the butterfly, and this does not happen. If any\r\none hazarded the assumption that the determinants of the butterfly\r\ndevelop only in the caterpillar, but quite independently of its\r\nconstitution, he would either be making an absurd statement, namely,\r\nthat the characters of the butterfly were not transmissible at all,\r\nor he would be unconsciously admitting that the determinants of the\r\nbutterfly were already contained in the parts of the caterpillar, and\r\ncome direct from the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nThat the characters of the butterfly do vary independently of those\r\nof the caterpillar I demonstrated many years ago, when we were still\r\nvery far away from the idea of the germ-plasm or of determinants. I\r\ndemonstrated then that the constancy of the markings of a species can\r\nbe quite different in the two chief stages; that the caterpillar may be\r\nvery variable, while the butterfly or the moth may be very constant in\r\nall its markings, or conversely. I called attention to the dimorphic\r\ncaterpillars which are green or brown, and yet become the same moth\r\n(for instance, _Deilephila elpenor_ and _Sphinx convolvuli_); I cited\r\nthe case of the spurge hawk-moth (_Deilephila euphorbiæ_), whose dark\r\nbut at the same time motley caterpillars occur in the Riviera at\r\nNice as a local variety (_Nicæa_), and there wear quite a different\r\ndress--pale clay-yellow, with a double row of large conspicuous dark\r\nyellow eye-spots--while the moth does not differ from our variety\r\nin a single definite character, except in its larger size. At that\r\ntime, too, I instituted experiments with the caterpillars of the\r\nsmallest of our indigenous Vanessa species (_Vanessa levana_), of\r\nwhich the majority are black with black thorns, while a minority are\r\nyellowish-brown with yellow thorns; reared separately, both yielded the\r\nsame butterfly, though in this case one would be inclined to suppose\r\nthat there was some internal connexion between the colour of the\r\ncaterpillar and that of the butterfly, since the butterfly also occurs\r\nin two colours. It was shown, however, that the colour of the butterfly\r\nhad nothing to do with that of the caterpillar, for it is known to be\r\ndependent on the season, and is a seasonal dimorphism, 'while the two\r\nforms of caterpillar may occur side by side at all times of the year.'\r\n\r\nSubsequently I made a similar experiment with the dimorphic\r\ncaterpillars of the 'fire'-butterfly (_Polyommatus phlæas_), and it\r\nyielded the same result. The pure green caterpillars became the same\r\nbutterflies as those marked with broad red longitudinal stripes, and in\r\nthis case we can definitely describe both colours as protective, for\r\nthe green form is adapted to the green under surface of the leaf, the\r\nred-striped to the green red-edged stalk of the lesser sorrel (_Rumex\r\nacetosella_).\r\n\r\nThere was really no necessity for special proofs that the caterpillar\r\nand butterfly vary transmissibly in complete independence of each\r\nother, for the facts of metamorphosis alone are enough to prove it. How\r\nwould it have been possible otherwise that the jaws adapted for biting\r\nshould, in the primitive insects, and in the locusts which are nearest\r\nto them, remain as a biting apparatus throughout life, while in the\r\ncaterpillar they are modified during its pupal stage into the suctorial\r\nproboscis of the butterfly? The parts of insects, therefore, must be\r\ncapable of transmissible variation in the stages of life independently\r\nof each other. Not only have the jaws of the leaf-eating caterpillars\r\nremained unaltered, while in the sexually mature animal they have been\r\ngradually modified into a very long and extremely complex suctorial\r\napparatus, but when at a much later time this proboscis became\r\nsuperfluous in a species, because the butterfly or moth, from some\r\ncause or another, lost the habit of taking any nourishment at all, its\r\ndegeneration exercised no effect on the jaws of the caterpillar, as we\r\ncan observe in many hawk-moths, silk-moths and Geometridæ. How could\r\nsuch a degeneration become transmissible if the caterpillar's jaws,\r\nfrom which those of the adult are developed, remain the same? We are\r\nthus forced to assume that there is something in the latter which can\r\nvary from the germ, without the jaws themselves being altered thereby.\r\nThis 'something' it is which I call 'determinants,' vital particles,\r\nwhich--however we may try to picture them--are indeed contained in the\r\ncells of the caterpillar's jaws, but are there inactive and do not\r\ninfluence the structure of these, while, on the other hand, it is their\r\nconstitution which determines the form and structure of the suctorial\r\nproboscis of the butterfly down to the minutest details. It must be\r\nthese alone which cause the suctorial proboscis to develop, and in some\r\ncases to degenerate again, without bringing about any change in the\r\ncorresponding parts in the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89. Anterior region of the larva of a Midge\r\n(_Corethra plumicornis_). _K_, head. _Th_, thorax. _ui_, inferior\r\nimaginal disks. _oi_, superior imaginal disks. _ui_^1, _ui_^2, and\r\n_ui_^3, the primordia of the limbs. _oi_^2 and _oi_^3, the primordia of\r\nthe wings and 'balancers.' _g_, brain. _bg_, chain of ventral ganglia\r\nwith nerves which enter the imaginal disks. _trb_, tracheal vesicle.\r\nEnlarged about 15 times.]\r\n\r\nThis example seems to me to be preferable to that of the wings of\r\ninsects in this respect, that there is no organ in the caterpillar\r\nwith a specific function corresponding to the wing of the butterfly.\r\nYet the two cases are exactly alike, and it would be a mistake to say\r\nthat the first primordium of the wing within the caterpillar is not\r\na part of the caterpillar at all. At first, certainly, it is only a\r\ngroup of cells on the skin, occurring at a particular spot on the\r\ndorsal surface of the second and third segments of the caterpillar,\r\nand doubtless arising from a single cell of the embryo, the 'primitive\r\nwing-cell,' which, however, has not as yet been demonstrated. But\r\nit is nevertheless an integral part of the caterpillar, which could\r\nneither be wanting, nor be larger or smaller, and so on; which, in\r\nshort, does mean something for the caterpillar, although perhaps not\r\nmore than any other of the skin-cells. For the butterfly, however, this\r\narea on the skin means the rudiment of the wing; for from it alone\r\ncan there arise by multiplication the aggregate of cells which grows\r\nout into a hollow protuberance, enlarges by degrees into a disk, the\r\nimaginal disk, and eventually develops into the form of wing peculiar\r\nto the species. This imaginal disk is connected very early with nerves\r\nand with tracheæ, as may be beautifully seen especially in dipterous\r\nlarvæ (Fig. 89, _oi_), and these become later the nerves and tracheæ\r\nof the wing, while thousands of peculiar scale-like hairs develop\r\non the upper surface; in short, the rudiment becomes a perfect wing\r\nwith its specific venation, and with the marking and colouring which\r\nis often so complicated in Lepidoptera. Almost every little spot and\r\nstripe of the latter is handed down with the most tenacious power\r\nof transmission from generation to generation, and each can at the\r\nsame time be transmissibly varied; the same is true of the venation,\r\nwhich is so important systematically just because it is so strictly\r\nhereditary, yet it too can vary transmissibly, as can also the hooked\r\nbristles, the odoriferous apparatus, and, in short, the whole complex\r\nstructure of the wing, with all its specific adaptations to the mode of\r\nflight, to the manner of life, and to the colour of the environment.\r\nHow is it possible that all this can develop from a skin-cell? Is it\r\nthe influence of position that effects it, and could any other cell\r\nof the caterpillar's skin do the same if it were placed in the same\r\nposition? Could any neighbour-cell of the primitive wing-cell replace\r\nit if it were destroyed? It is hardly probable, and I think I can even\r\nprove that this is not so. The experiment of killing such a cell in\r\nthe living animal has not yet been made; if it should succeed, we may\r\nventure to say in advance that none of the neighbouring skin-cells\r\nwill be able to do its work and take its place in developing a wing;\r\nthe wing in question will simply remain undeveloped. In the summer of\r\n1897 I hatched a specimen of _Vanessa antiope_ from the pupa, which,\r\nthough otherwise normal and well-developed, lacked the left posterior\r\nwing altogether; no trace of it could be recognized. In this case, from\r\nsome cause which could no longer be discovered, the first formative\r\ncell of the wing in the hypodermis, or its descendants, must have been\r\ndestroyed, and no substitution of another took place, as the defect\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\nThe young science of developmental mechanics attributes to the position\r\nof a cell in the midst of a group of cells a determining value as\r\nregards its further fate, and as far as the cells of the segmenting\r\novum are concerned this seems to be true in certain cases, but the\r\nassumption cannot be generally true except in a very subordinate sense.\r\nThe formative cell of the wing does not become what it is because of\r\nits relative position in the organism. If this were so it could not\r\nhappen that a wing should develop instead of a leg, as was observed\r\nin a _Zygæna_, nor could there be any of those deformities already\r\nreferred to, to which the name 'Heterotopia' is applied, and which\r\nconsist in the development of organs of definite normal structure, or\r\nat any rate of apparently normal structure in quite unusual places, e.\r\ng. an antenna on the coxa of a leg, or of a leg instead of an antenna\r\n(in _Sirex_), or instead of a wing. It is therefore not some influence\r\nfrom without that makes that particular skin-cell of the caterpillar\r\nthe rudiment of the wing, but the _reason lies within itself_, in its\r\nown constitution. As the whole mass of determinants for the whole body\r\nand for all the stages of its development must be contained within\r\nthe ovum and the sperm-cell, so the primitive cell of the butterfly's\r\nwing must contain all the determinants for the building up of this\r\ncomplicated part; and if the cell gets into a wrong position in the\r\ncourse of development because of some disturbance or other, a wing\r\nmay develop from it in that position if the conditions are not too\r\nutterly divergent. These heterotopic phenomena afford a further proof\r\nof the existence of determinants, because they are quite unintelligible\r\nwithout the assumption of 'primary constituents' or _Anlagen_.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of determinants in the germ-plasm is so fundamental to\r\nmy theory of development that I should like to adduce another case\r\nin its support and justification. The limbs of the jointed-footed\r\nanimals, or Arthropods, originally arose as a pair on each segment\r\nof the body, and they were at first alike or very similar both in\r\ntheir function and in their form. We find illustration of this in\r\nthe millipedes, and still more in the species of the interesting\r\ngenus _Peripatus_, which resembles them externally, as well as in the\r\nswimming and creeping bristle-footed marine worms (Chætopods) belonging\r\nto the Annelid phylum. We can quite well picture to ourselves that the\r\nwhole series of these appendages was represented in the germ-plasm by\r\na single determinant or group of determinants, which only required\r\nto be multiplied in development. Without disputing whether this has\r\nreally been the case in the primitive Arthropods or not, it is certain\r\nthat it can no longer be the case in the germ-plasm of the Arthropods\r\nof to-day. In these each pair of appendages must be represented by\r\na particular determinant. We must infer this from the fact that\r\nthe several pairs of these appendages have varied transmissibly,\r\nindependently of each other, for some are jaws, others swimming legs,\r\nor merely bearers of the gills or of the eggs; others are walking legs,\r\ndigging legs, or jumping legs. In Crustaceans a forceps-like claw\r\nis often borne by the first of the otherwise similarly constructed\r\nappendages, or also by the second or the third, or there may be no\r\nforceps, and so on; in short, we see that each individual pair has\r\nadapted itself independently to the mode of life of its species. This\r\ncould only have been possible if each was represented in the germ-plasm\r\nby an element, whose variations caused _a variation only in that one\r\npair of legs, and in no other_.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be objected that the differences in the appendages may\r\nquite well have had their origin simply during the development of the\r\nanimal, while the primary constituents were the same for all, so that a\r\nsingle determinant in the germ-plasm would suffice. But this could only\r\nbe the case if the differences depended not on internal but on external\r\ncauses, that is, if the same primary constituents gave rise to a set\r\nof appendages which became different because they were subject in the\r\ncourse of their development to different modifying influences. But\r\nthis is not the case, at least not to the extent that this supposition\r\nwould necessitate. Can it be supposed that, for instance, the jumping\r\nlegs of the water-flea (_Gammarus_) are a necessary consequence of the\r\nsomewhat divergent form of the segments from which they grow? A direct\r\nproof to the contrary may be found in 'Heterotopia,' for in the place\r\nwhere a posterior limb, modified for holding the eggs, normally occurs\r\nin the crab an ordinary walking leg may exceptionally develop (Fig. 90,\r\nBethe), or an appendage resembling an antenna may take the place of an\r\nextirpated eye (Herbst). But if there were really only one determinant\r\nin the germ-plasm for all the appendages these would of necessity be\r\nall alike, apart from the larger or smaller differences which might be\r\nstamped upon them by growing from segments different in size and in\r\nnutrition. Such differences, however, are far from being sufficient to\r\nexplain the great deviations seen among the appendages of most kinds\r\nof Crustaceans, and still less to explain their adaptation to quite\r\ndifferent functions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90. The Common Shore-Crab (_Carcinus mænas_), seen\r\nfrom below, with the abdomen forced back.

After Bethe.]\r\n\r\nIt need not be imagined that my argument can be controverted by\r\nsaying that _one_ appendage-determinant in the germ may split\r\nitself in the course of development into a series of different\r\nappendage-determinants. The question would then arise, How is it\r\nable to do so? And the answer can be no other than that the single\r\nfirst determinant had within it several different kinds of elements,\r\nwhich subsequently separated to determine in different ways the\r\nvarious appendages. But that is just another way of saying that this\r\nsingle determinant actually includes within itself several different\r\ndeterminants. For a determinant means nothing more than an element\r\nof the germ-substance by whose presence in the germ the specific\r\ndevelopment of a particular part of the body is conditioned. If we\r\ncould remove the determinants of a particular appendage from the\r\ngerm-plasm this appendage would not develop; if we could cause it to\r\nvary the appendage also would turn out differently.\r\n\r\nIn this general sense the determinants of the germ-plasm are not\r\nhypothetical, but actual; just as surely as if we had seen them with\r\nour eyes, and followed their development. Hypothesis begins when we\r\nattempt to make creatures of flesh and blood out of these mere symbols,\r\nand to say how they are constituted. But even here there are some\r\nthings which may be maintained with certainty; for instance, that they\r\nare _not_ miniature models, in Bonnet's sense, of the parts which they\r\ndetermine; and, further, that they are not lifeless material, mere\r\nsubstances, but living parts, vital units. If this were not so they\r\nwould not remain as they are throughout the course of development,\r\nbut would be displaced and destroyed by the metabolism, instead of\r\ndominating it as living matter alone can do--doubtless undergoing\r\noxidation, but at the same time assimilating material from without,\r\nand thereby growing. There cannot be lifeless determinants; they must\r\nbe living units capable of nutrition, growth, and multiplication by\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have arrived at the point at which a discussion of\r\nthe organization of the living substance in general can best be\r\ninterpolated.\r\n\r\nThe Viennese physiologist, Ernst Brücke, forty years ago promulgated\r\nthe theory that living matter could not be a mere mixture of chemical\r\nmolecules of any kind whatever; it must be 'organized,' that is, it\r\nmust be composed of small, invisible, vital units. If, as we must\r\ncertainly assume, the mechanical theory of life is correct, if there\r\nis no vital force in the sense of the 'Natur-Philosophie,' Brücke's\r\npronouncement is undoubtedly true; for a fortuitous mixture of\r\nmolecules could no more produce the phenomena of life than a _single_\r\nmolecule could, because, as far as our experience goes, molecules\r\ndo not live; they neither assimilate, nor grow, nor multiply. Life\r\ncan therefore arise only through a particular combination of diverse\r\nmolecules, and all living substance must consist of such definite\r\ngroups of molecules. Shortly after Brücke, Herbert Spencer likewise\r\nassumed the reality of such vital 'units,' and the same assumption\r\nhas been made in more recent times by Wiesner, De Vries, and myself.\r\nIn the meantime we can say nothing more definite about the composition\r\nof these bearers of life, or 'biophors,' as I call them, than that\r\nalbumen-molecules, water, salts, and some other substances play the\r\nchief part in their composition. This has been found out by analysis\r\nof dead protoplasm; but in what form these substances are contained in\r\nthe biophors, and how they affect each other in order to produce the\r\nphenomena of life by going through a ceaseless cycle of disruptions and\r\nreconstructions, is still entirely hidden from us.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, nothing to do with that here; we content ourselves\r\nwith recognizing in the biophors the characteristics of life, and\r\npicturing to ourselves that all living substance, cell-substance, and\r\nnuclear substance, muscle-, nerve-, and gland-substance, in all their\r\ndiverse forms, consist of biophors, though, of course, of the most\r\nvaried composition. There must be innumerable kinds of biophors in all\r\nthe diverse parts of the millions of forms of life which now live upon\r\nthe earth; but all must be constructed on a certain fundamental plan,\r\nwhich conditions their marvellous capacity for life; all possess the\r\nfundamental characters of life--dissimilation, assimilation, growth,\r\nand multiplication by division. We must also ascribe to them in some\r\ndegree the power of movement and sensibility.\r\n\r\nAs to their size, we can only say that they are far below the limits\r\nof visibility, and that even the minutest granules which we can barely\r\nperceive by means of our most powerful microscopes cannot be small\r\nindividual biophors, but must be aggregates of these. On the other\r\nhand, the biophors must be larger than any chemical molecule, because\r\nthey themselves consist of a group of molecules, among which are some\r\nof complex composition, and therefore of relatively considerable size.\r\n\r\nIt may now be asked whether the determinants, whose existence we have\r\nalready inferred, are not identical with these 'biophors' or smallest\r\nliving particles; but that is not the case, at least not generally. We\r\ncalled determinants those parts of the germ-substance which determine a\r\n'hereditary character' of the body; that is, whose presence in the germ\r\ndetermines that a particular part of the body, whether it consists of\r\na group of cells, a single cell, or a part of a cell, shall develop in\r\na specific manner, and whose variations cause the variations of these\r\nparticular parts alone.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be asked how large and how numerous such 'hereditary\r\nparts' may be, whether they correspond to every distinct part of a\r\ncell, or to every cell of the body, or only to the larger cell groups.\r\nObviously the areas which are individually determined from the germ\r\nmust differ in size, according as we have to do with an organism which\r\nis small or large, simple or more complex. Unicellular organisms,\r\nsuch as Infusorians, probably possess special determinants for a\r\nnumber of cell-organs and cell-parts, although we cannot directly\r\nobserve the independent and transmissible variation of these organs;\r\nlowly multicellular animals, such as the calcareous sponges, will\r\nrequire a relatively small number of determinants, but in the higher\r\nmulticellular organisms, as, for instance, in most Arthropods, the\r\nnumber must be very high, reaching many thousands if not hundreds of\r\nthousands, for in them almost everything in the body is specialized,\r\nand must have varied through independent variation from the germ. Thus\r\nin many Crustaceans the smelling-hairs occur singly on special joints\r\nof the antennæ, and the number of joints furnished with a smelling-hair\r\nis different in different species; the size, too, of the smelling-hairs\r\nthemselves varies greatly, being, for instance, much smaller in our\r\ncommon Asellus than in the blind form from the depths of our lakes, in\r\nwhich the absence of sight is compensated for by an increased acuteness\r\nof the sense of smell. Thus the smelling-hairs may vary transmissibly\r\nin themselves, while any joint of the antennæ may also produce one\r\nindependently through variation. In this case accordingly we must\r\nassume that there are special determinants for the smelling-hairs, and\r\nfor the joints of the antennæ. But we cannot always and everywhere\r\nrefer identical or approximately similar organs, when there are many\r\nof them, to a corresponding number of determinants. Certainly the\r\nhairs of mammals or the scales of butterflies' wings do not all vary\r\nindividually and independently, but those of a certain region vary\r\ntogether, and are therefore probably represented in the germ-plasm by\r\na single determinant. These regions often appear to be very small,\r\nas is best seen by the fine lines, spots, and bands which compose\r\nthe marking of a butterfly's wing, and still more in the odoriferous\r\nscales occurring in some butterflies, as, for instance, in the blue\r\nbutterflies (_Lycæna_). These little lute-shaped scales do not occur\r\nin all species, and they occur in very unequal numbers even in those\r\nwhich possess them; there are certain species which exhibit only about\r\na dozen, and these are all on one little spot of the wing. Since these\r\nodoriferous scales must have arisen as modifications of the ordinary\r\nhair-like scales, as one of my pupils, Dr. Köhler, has demonstrated by\r\ncomparative studies, these ordinary hair-like scales must have varied\r\ntransmissibly at certain spots, that is, their determinants have varied\r\nwhile those of the surrounding scales have not.\r\n\r\nThe case is the same in respect to the sound-producing apparatus of\r\nmany insects. Many grasshoppers produce sounds by fiddling with the\r\nthigh of the hind leg on the wing, others by rubbing one anterior wing\r\nupon the other, and, indeed, always with one particular vein in one\r\nupon a particular vein in the other. One of these serves as the bow,\r\nthe other as the string, of the violin, and the bow is furnished with\r\nteeth (Fig. 91), ranged beside each other in a long row, which have\r\nthe same function as the colophonium of the violin, that is, to grasp\r\nand release the strings alternately, and thus to produce resounding\r\nvibrations. My pupils, Dr. Petrunkewitsch and Dr. Georg von Guaita,\r\nhave recently proved that these teeth have arisen as modifications of\r\nthe hairs which are scattered everywhere over the wing and leg. But\r\nonly in this one place, on the so-called 'stridulating-vein,' have\r\nthey been modified to form stridulating teeth (_schr_). Thus this\r\nvein must be capable of transmissible variation by itself alone, that\r\nis, there must be parts contained in the germ-plasm, the variation of\r\nwhich causes a variation solely of this individual vein and its hairs,\r\npossibly even a variation only on certain hairs on this vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91. Hind leg of a Locustid (_Stenobothrus\r\nprotorma_), after Graber. _fe_, femur. _ti_, tibia. _ta_, tarsal\r\njoints. _schr_, the stridulating ridge.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are also large regions, whole cell-masses\r\nof the body, which in all probability vary only _en bloc_, as, for\r\ninstance, the milliards of blood-cells in Man, the hundreds of\r\nthousands or millions of cells in the liver and other glandular organs,\r\nthe thousands of fibres of a muscle, or of the sinews or fascia, the\r\ncells of a cartilage or a bone, and so on. In all these cases a single\r\ndeterminant, or at least a few in the germ-plasm, may be enough. But in\r\nnumerous cases it is impossible to say how large the region is which\r\nis controlled by a single determinant, and it is, of course, of no\r\nimportance to the theory. In unicellular organisms the determinants\r\nwill control parts of cells, in multicellular organisms often whole\r\ncells and groups of cells.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an inference as to the nature of the determinants may be drawn\r\nfrom this with some probability, in as far as mere parts of cells may\r\nbe supposed to have simpler determinants than whole cells and groups of\r\ncells. The determinants in the chromosomes of unicellular organisms\r\nmay therefore often consist of single biophors, so that in this case\r\nthe conception of biophors would coincide with that of determinants.\r\nIn multicellular organisms, on the other hand, I should be inclined\r\non the whole to picture the determinant as a group of biophors, which\r\nare bound together by internal forces to form a higher vital unity.\r\nThis determinant must live as a whole, that is, assimilate, grow, and\r\nmultiply by division, like every vital unit, and its biophors must be\r\nindividually variable, so that the separate parts of a cell controlled\r\nby them may also be capable of transmissible variation. That they are\r\nso, every highly differentiated cell of a higher animal teaches us;\r\neven the smelling-hairs of a crab exhibit a stalk, a terminal knob, and\r\nan internal filament, and many muscle-, nerve-, and gland-cells are\r\nmuch more complex in structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GERM-PLASM THEORY (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Structure of the germ-plasm--Vital affinities--Division--O.\r\n Hertwig's chief objections to this theory--Male and female eggs\r\n in the Phylloxera show differential division--Dispersal of the\r\n germ-plasm in the course of Ontogeny--Active and passive state\r\n of the determinants--Predetermination of cells--There are no\r\n determinants of characters--Liberation of the determinants--Accessory\r\n idioplasm--Herbst's lithium larvæ--Plant galls--Cells with several\r\n facultative determinants--Connective tissue in vertebrates--Mesoderm\r\n cells of Echinoderms--Sexual dimorphism--Female and male\r\n ids--Polymorphism (_Papilio merope_)--Ants.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured to prove that the germ-substance proper must be\r\nlooked for in the chromatin of the nucleus of the germ-cell, and more\r\nprecisely still in those ids or chromosomes which we conceive of as\r\ncontaining the primary constituents (_Anlagen_) of a complete organism.\r\nSuch ids in larger or smaller numbers make up the whole germ-plasm of\r\na germ-cell, and each id in its turn consists of primary constituents\r\nor determinants, i.e. of vital units, each of which determines the\r\norigin and development of a particular part of the organism. We have\r\nnow to make an attempt to picture to ourselves how these determinants\r\npredetermine those cells or cell-groups to which they correspond. In\r\ndoing so we have to fall back upon mere hypotheses, and in stating any\r\nsuch hypothesis I wish expressly to emphasize that I am only following\r\nup one of the possibilities which our imaginative faculty suggests.\r\nNevertheless, to endeavour to form such a conception is certainly not\r\nwithout use, for it is only by elaborating a theory to the utmost\r\nthat we are able to use it in application to concrete cases, thus\r\nstimulating the search for corroboratory or contradictory facts, and\r\nleading gradually to a recognition of the gaps or mistakes in the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe first condition that must be fulfilled in order that a determinant\r\nmay be able to control a cell or cell-group is that it should\r\nsucceed in getting into it. It must be guided through the numerous\r\ncell-divisions of ontogeny so that it shall ultimately come to lie\r\nin the cells which it is to control. This presupposes that each\r\ndeterminant has from the very beginning its definite position in\r\nrelation to the rest, and that the germ-plasm, therefore, is not a mere\r\nloose aggregate of determinants, but that it possesses a structure, an\r\narchitecture, in which the individual determinants have each their\r\ndefinite place. The position of the determinants in relation to one\r\nanother cannot be due to chance, but depends partly on their historical\r\ndevelopment from earlier ancestral determinants, partly on internal\r\nforces, such as we have already assumed for keeping the determinants\r\ntogether. We may best designate these hypothetical forces 'affinities,'\r\nand in order to distinguish them from mere chemical affinities we\r\nmay call them 'vital.' There must be forces interacting among the\r\ndifferent determinants which bind them together into a living whole,\r\nthe id, which can assimilate, grow, and multiply by division, in the\r\nsame manner as we were forced to assume for the smaller units, the\r\nbiophors and single determinants. In the ids, however, we can observe\r\nthe working of these forces quite directly, since each chromosome\r\nsplits into two halves of equal size at every nuclear division, and not\r\nthrough the agency of external forces, e.g. the attraction which we may\r\nassume to be exerted by the fibrils of the nuclear spindle, but through\r\npurely internal forces, often long before the nuclear spindle has been\r\nformed at all.\r\n\r\nBut if the determinants must separate from each other in the course\r\nof development so as to penetrate singly into the cells they are\r\nto control, the id must not only have the power of dividing into\r\ndaughter-ids of identical composition, it must also possess the power\r\nof dividing under certain influences into dissimilar halves, so that\r\nthe two daughter-ids contain different complexes of determinants. The\r\nfirst mode of division of the id, and with it of the nucleus and of the\r\ncell, I call _erbgleich_, or integral, the second _erbungleich_, or\r\ndifferential. The first form of multiplication is the usual one, which\r\nwe observe everywhere when unicellular organisms divide themselves into\r\ntwo equal daughter-units, or when the cells of multicellular bodies\r\nproduce their like by division into two. The second is not directly\r\nobservable, because a dissimilarity of the daughter-cells, as long as\r\nit lies only in the idioplasm, cannot be actually seen; it can only\r\nbe inferred from the different rôle which the two daughter-cells play\r\nin the building up of the individual. When, for instance, one of two\r\nsister-cells of the embryo gives rise to the cells of the alimentary\r\ncanal and the other to those of the skin and the nervous system,\r\nI infer that the mother-cell divided its nuclear substance in a\r\ndifferential way between the two daughter-cells, so that one contained\r\nthe determinants of the endoderm, the other those of the ectoderm; or\r\nwhen a red and a black spot lie side by side and under exactly the same\r\nconditions on the wing of a butterfly, I conclude that the ancestral\r\ncells of these two spots have divided differentially, so that one\r\nreceived the 'red,' the other the 'black' determinants. Our eyes can\r\nperceive no difference between the nuclear substance of the two cells,\r\nbut the same is true of the chromosomes of the paternal and maternal\r\nnuclei in the fertilized ovum, although we know in this case that\r\nthey contain different tendencies. In any case we are not justified\r\nin concluding from the apparent similarity of the chromosome-halves\r\nin nuclear division that there cannot be differential division. The\r\ntheoretical possibility that there is such differential division cannot\r\nbe disputed; indeed, I am inclined to say that it is more easily\r\nimagined than the division of the ids into absolutely similar halves.\r\nBoth are only conceivable on the assumption that there are forces which\r\ncontrol the mutual position of the determinants in the ids, that is, on\r\nthe assumption of 'affinities.' I shall not follow this further, but\r\nthat there are forces operative within the ids which are still entirely\r\nunknown to us is proved at every nuclear division by the _spontaneous_\r\nsplitting of the chromosomes.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to my theory that such a complex whole as the\r\nid could not in any case multiply by division, since there is no\r\napparatus present which can, in the division into two daughter-units,\r\nre-establish the architecture disturbed by the growth. But this\r\nobjection is only valid if we refuse to admit the combining forces, the\r\n'vital affinities' within the ids, and the same is true for the smaller\r\nvital units. An ordinary chemical molecule cannot increase by division;\r\nif it be forcibly divided it falls into different molecules altogether;\r\nit is only the living molecule, that is, the biophor, which possesses\r\nthis marvellous property of growth and division into two halves similar\r\nto itself and to the ancestral molecule, and we may argue from this\r\nthat in the division of the ids forces of attraction and repulsion must\r\nlikewise be operative[19].\r\n\r\n[19] In my book _The Germ-Plasm_ I have already assumed the existence\r\nof 'forces of attraction' in the determinants and biophors, as in the\r\ncells. I did not, indeed, enter into details, but I argued on the same\r\nbasis as now (_Germ-Plasm_, p. 64, English edition). My critics have\r\noverlooked this.\r\n\r\nI see no reason why we should not assume the existence of such\r\nforces, when we make the assumption that the hundreds of atoms which,\r\naccording to our modern conceptions, compose the molecule of albumen\r\nand determine its nature, are kept by affinities in this definite and\r\nexceedingly complex arrangement. Or must we suppose that between the\r\natom-complex of the molecule and the next higher atom-complex of the\r\nbiophor, determinant, and id there is an absolute line of demarcation,\r\nso that we must assume quite different forces in the latter from those\r\nwe conceive of as operative in the former? The biophor is ultimately\r\nonly a group of molecules, the determinants a group of biophors, the\r\nid a group of determinants, and all the three inferred stages of vital\r\norganization only become real units through the forces operating within\r\nthem and combining them into a whole. What compels the chromatin\r\ngranules of the resting nucleus to approach each other at the time of\r\ncell-division, to unite into a long, band-like thread, and what is it\r\nthat subsequently causes this thread to break up again into a definite\r\nnumber of pieces? Obviously only internal forces of which we know\r\nnothing further than that they are operative.\r\n\r\nWe shall see later that this assumption of vital affinities must be\r\nmade not only in regard to the cells, but also in regard to entire\r\norganisms whose parts are united by an internal bond, and whose\r\nco-ordination is regulated by forces of which we have as yet no secure\r\nknowledge. In the meantime we may designate these forces by the name of\r\n'vital affinities.'\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that some objections of a fundamental\r\nnature have been urged against the assumption of a differential nuclear\r\ndivision of the hereditary substance. O. Hertwig holds that the\r\nassumption of differential division is essentially untenable, because\r\nit is contradictory to 'one of the first principles of reproduction,'\r\nfor 'a physiologically fundamental character of every living being is\r\nthe power of maintaining its species.'\r\n\r\nThis certainly seems so, but a closer examination shows that this\r\n'principle,' although correct enough when taken in a very general\r\nsense, does not really cover the facts, and is therefore incapable\r\nof supporting the inferences drawn from it. If the proposition\r\nexpressed the whole truth there could have been no evolution from\r\nthe primitive organisms to higher ones, every living being must have\r\nsimply reproduced exact copies of itself. Whether the transformations\r\nof species have been sudden or gradual, whether they have been brought\r\nabout by large steps or by very small ones, they could only have come\r\nabout by breaking through this so-called 'principle' of like begetting\r\nlike. In fact, we may with more justice maintain the exact converse\r\nof the principle, and say that 'no living being is able to produce an\r\nexact copy of itself,' and this is true not only of sexual, but of\r\nasexual reproduction.\r\n\r\nIn ontogeny we see exactly the same thing. There are no two\r\ndaughter-cells of a mother-cell which are exactly alike, and the\r\ndifferences between them, if they increase in the same direction, may\r\nlead in later descendants to entire differences of structure. Indeed\r\nthe whole process of development depends on such an augmentation\r\nof the differences between two daughter-cells--on differences which\r\nproceed from within and are definitely pre-established. Here, again,\r\nthe facts do not justify us in making a dogma of the proposition that\r\nit is a 'fundamental power' of every living being to maintain its\r\nspecies by producing replicas of itself. If we look at two directly\r\nsuccessive cell-generations, we can hardly, it is true, in most cases,\r\nperceive any difference between them, just as in the generations\r\nof species; but if we compare the end of a long cell-lineage with\r\nthe beginning, then the difference is marked, and we recognize that\r\nthe difference is due to a gradual summing up of minute, invisible\r\ndeviations. In my opinion these steps of difference cannot possibly\r\ndepend merely on direct external influences; they proceed rather from\r\nthe hereditary substance the cell receives from the ovum, which,\r\ntherefore, in order to attain to such many-sided and far-reaching\r\ndifferentiation, must have undergone a frequently repeated splitting\r\nup of its qualities. That this splitting is not merely a variation\r\nto which the whole of the hereditary substance of the daughter-cells\r\nis uniformly subject, according to the influences dependent on their\r\nposition in relation to other cells of the embryo, will be made clear\r\nfrom the case of the Ctenophora referred to in the next lecture. A\r\nscarcely less striking example is that of those animals in which the\r\nova contain the primary constituents for only one sex, in which, in\r\nother words, there are 'male' ova and 'female' ova. This is the case,\r\nfor instance, among Rotifers, and in plant-lice such as the vine-pest,\r\n_Phylloxera_. Here the eggs from which males develop are smaller than\r\nthose which produce females. The primary constituents for both male\r\nand female are not, as in most animals, contained in the same ovum,\r\nto be liberated on one side or the other by influences unknown to\r\nus, but in each ovum there is only one of the two sets of primary\r\nconstituents present, and in this case, therefore, the development of\r\nhermaphrodites, which not infrequently occur in other animals, would\r\nbe impossible. But all these ova have been produced by one primitive\r\nreproductive cell, and consequently, at one of the divisions implied\r\nin the multiplication of this first cell, a separation of the male\r\nfrom the female primary constituents must have taken place, that is, a\r\ndifferential division of hereditary substance, for which no external\r\nand no intercellular influences can possibly account.\r\n\r\nIf there is, then, a differential division of the ids and with them\r\nof the whole idioplasm, the germ-plasm of the fertilized ovum must\r\nbe broken up in the course of ontogeny into ever smaller groups of\r\ndeterminants. I conceive of this as happening in the following manner.\r\n\r\nIn many animals the fertilized ovum divides at the first segmentation\r\ninto two cells, one of which gives rise predominantly to the outer,\r\nthe other to the inner germinal layer, as in molluscs, for instance.\r\nLet us now assume that this is the case altogether, so that one of the\r\nfirst two blastomeres gives rise to the whole of the ectoderm, the\r\nother to the whole of the endoderm; we should here have a differential\r\ndivision, for the developmental import (the 'prospective' of Driesch)\r\nof the primitive ectoderm-cell is quite different from that of the\r\nprimitive endoderm-cell, the former giving origin to the skin and the\r\nnervous system, with the sense organs, while the second gives rise\r\nto the alimentary canal, with the liver, &c. Through this step in\r\nsegmentation, I conclude, the determinants of all the ectoderm-cells\r\nbecome separated from those of the endoderm-cells; the determinant\r\narchitecture of the ids must be so constructed in such species that\r\nit can be segregated at the first egg-cleavage into ectodermal and\r\nendodermal groups of determinants. Such differential divisions will\r\nalways occur in embryogenesis when it is necessary to divide a cell\r\ninto two daughter-cells having dissimilar developmental import,\r\nand consequently they will continue to occur until the determinant\r\narchitecture of the ids is completely analysed or segregated out into\r\nits different kinds of determinants, so that each cell ultimately\r\ncontains only one kind of determinant, the one by which its own\r\nparticular character is determined. This character of course consists\r\nnot merely in its morphological structure and chemical content, but\r\nalso in its collective physiological capacity, including its power of\r\ndivision and duration of life[20].\r\n\r\n[20] Emery has lately called attention to another direct proof of the\r\nexistence of differential cell- and nucleus-division. According to\r\nobservations made by Giardina, in the water-beetle (_Dytiscus_), one\r\nprimitive ovum-cell gives rise, through four successive divisions,\r\nto fifteen nutritive cells and one well-defined ovum-cell. But only\r\nhalf of the nuclear substance takes part in these divisions, the rest\r\nremains inactive in a condensed, cloudy condition. 'The meaning of\r\nthe whole process is obviously that the germ-plasm mass as a whole is\r\nhanded over to the ovum-cell, while the nutritive cells receive only\r\nthe nuclear constituents which belong to them' (_Biol. Centralbl._, May\r\n15, 1903).\r\n\r\nBut embryogenesis does not proceed by differential divisions alone,\r\nfor integral divisions are often interpolated between them, always,\r\nfor instance, when in a bilateral animal an embryonic cell has to\r\nproduce by division into two a corresponding organ for the right and\r\nleft sides of the body; for instance, in the division of the primitive\r\ngenital cell into the rudiments of the right and left reproductive\r\norgans, or in the division of the primitive mesoderm-cell into the\r\nright and left initial mesoderm-cell, but also later on in the course\r\nof embryogenesis, when, for instance, the right or the left primitive\r\nreproductive cell multiplies into a large number of primitive\r\ngerm-cells, or in the multiplication of the blood-cells, or of the\r\nepithelial cells of a particular region; in short, whenever mother and\r\ndaughter-cells have the same developmental import, that is, when they\r\nare to become nothing more than they already are. In all such cases a\r\nsimilar group of determinants, or a similar single determinant, must in\r\nthe nuclear division penetrate into each of the two daughter-cells.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way, it seems to me, that the determinants gain entrance\r\ninto the cells they are to control, by a regulated splitting up of the\r\nids into ever smaller groups of determinants, by a gradual analysis\r\nor segregation of the germ-plasm into the idioplasms of the different\r\nontogenetic stages. When I first developed this idea I assumed that the\r\nsplitting process would in all cases set in at the same time, namely,\r\nat the first division of the ovum. But since then, in the controversies\r\nexcited by the theory, many facts have been brought to light which\r\nprove that the ova of the different animal groups behave differently,\r\nand that the splitting up of the aggregate of primary constituents may\r\nsometimes begin later--but I shall return to this later on.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the segregation hypothesis, which is similar in purport\r\nto that advanced by Roux as the' mosaic theory,' it must strike us\r\nas remarkable that the chromatin mass of the nucleus does not become\r\nnotably smaller in the course of ontogeny, and even ultimately sink to\r\ninvisibility. Determinants lie far below the limits of visibility, and\r\nif there were really only a single determinant to control each cell\r\nthere would be no chromatin visible in such a case. This objection has\r\nin point of fact been urged against me, although I expressly emphasized\r\nin advance the assumption that the determinants are continually\r\nmultiplying throughout the whole ontogeny, so that in proportion as the\r\nnumber of the _kinds_ of determinants lying within a cell diminishes\r\nthe number of resting determinants of each kind increases. When,\r\nfinally, only one kind of determinant is present there is a whole army\r\nof determinants of that kind.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this conception of the gradual segregation of the\r\ncomponents of the id in the course of development that we must\r\nattribute to the determinants two different states, at least in regard\r\nto their effect upon the cell in which they lie: an active state,\r\nin which they control the cell, and a passive state, in which they\r\nexert no influence upon the cell, although they multiply. From the\r\negg onwards, therefore, a mass of determinants is handed on by the\r\ncell-divisions of embryogenesis, which will only later become active.\r\n\r\nMy conception of the manner in which the determinants become active is\r\nsimilar to that suggested by De Vries in regard to his 'Pangens,' very\r\nminute vital particles which play a determining part in his 'pangen\r\ntheory,' similar to that filled by the determinants in my germ-plasm\r\ntheory. It seems to me that the determinants must ultimately break\r\nup into the smallest vital elements of which they are composed, the\r\nbiophors, and that these migrate through the nuclear membrane into the\r\ncell-substance. But there a struggle for food and space must take place\r\nbetween the protoplasmic elements already present and the newcomers,\r\nand this gives rise to a more or less marked modification of the\r\ncell-structure.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the structure of these biophors corresponded\r\nin advance to certain constituent parts of the cell, that there were,\r\nfor instance, muscle biophors, which make the muscle what it is, or\r\nthat the plant-cells acquired their chlorophyll-making organs through\r\nchlorophyll biophors. De Vries gave expression to this view in his\r\n'pangen theory,' and I confess that at the time there seemed to me\r\nmuch to be said for it, but I am now doubtful whether its general\r\napplicability can be admitted. In the first place, it does not seem\r\nto me theoretically necessary to assume that the particles which\r\nmigrate into the cell-bodies should themselves be chlorophyll or muscle\r\nparticles; they may quite well be only the architects of these, that\r\nis to say, particles which by their co-operation with the elements\r\nalready present in the cell-body give rise to chlorophyll or muscle\r\nsubstance. As we are as yet unacquainted with the forces which dominate\r\nthese smallest vital particles, as well as the processes which lead\r\nto the histological differentiation of the cells, it is useless in\r\nthe meantime to make any further hypotheses in regard to them. But in\r\nany case the biophors which transform the general character of the\r\nembryonic cells into the specific character of a particular tissue-cell\r\nmust themselves possess a specific structure different from that of\r\nother biophors, for they must keep up the continuity of the structures\r\nhanded on from ancestors, chlorophyll and muscle-substance and the\r\nlike, since we cannot assume that these structures, so peculiar and so\r\ncomplex in their chemical and physical constitution, are formed afresh,\r\nso to speak, by spontaneous generation in each new being, as De Vries\r\nhas very rightly emphasized. A specific biophor, for instance, of\r\nmuscle substance will produce this substance as soon as it has found\r\nits way into the appropriate cell-body, even though it may not be a\r\ncontractile element itself.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added that the structure of the body and the\r\ndistinctive features of an organism do not depend merely on the\r\nhistological differentiation of the cells, but quite as much on\r\ntheir number and arrangement, and on the size and on the frequency\r\nof repetition of certain parts. These distinctive characters are just\r\nas constant and as strictly transmissible, and may be as heritably\r\nvariable as those which depend on specific cell-differentiation, and\r\nthey must therefore likewise be determinable by definite elements of\r\nthe germ-plasm. Obviously enough, however, these elements are not\r\nof the same nature as the known specific histological elementary\r\nparticles; they can be neither nerve-, muscle-, nor gland-biophors.\r\nThey must rather be vital units of such a kind that they communicate\r\nto the cells and lineage of cells, into whose bodies they migrate from\r\nwithin the nucleus, a definite vital power, that is, an organization\r\nwhich regulates the size, form, number of divisions, and so on, of\r\nthese cells--in short their whole prospective significance. Always,\r\nhowever, they act in co-operation with the cell-body into which they\r\nhave penetrated.\r\n\r\nThroughout we must hold ourselves aloof from the idea that 'characters'\r\nare transmissible. It is customary, indeed, to speak as if this\r\nwere so, and it is also necessary, because we can only recognize\r\nthe 'characters' of a body, and not the essential 'nature' on which\r\nthese characters depend; but the determinants are not seed-grains of\r\nindividual characters, but co-determinants of the nature of the parts\r\nwhich they influence. There are not special determinants of the size\r\nof a cell, others of its specific histological differentiation, and\r\nstill others of its duration of life, power of multiplication, and so\r\non; there are only determinants of the whole physiological nature of a\r\ncell, on which all these and many other 'characters' depend. For this\r\nreason alone I should object to the assumption that the determinants of\r\nthe germ are ready-made histological substances. That is as unlikely\r\nas that their groups in the germ-plasm are 'miniature models' of the\r\nfinished parts of the body.\r\n\r\nI conceive of the process of cell-differentiation as follows: at every\r\ncell-stage in the ontogeny determinants attain to maturity, and break\r\nup so that their biophors can migrate into the cell-bodies, so that the\r\nquality of each cell is thus kept continually under control, and may\r\nbe more or less modified, or may remain the same. By the 'maturity'\r\nof a determinant I mean its condition when by continual division it\r\nhas increased in number to such a point that its disintegration into\r\nbiophors and their migration into the cell-substance can take place.\r\n\r\nOne more point I must touch upon here, the question of the 'liberation'\r\nor 'stimulation' of the determinants. The activity of an organ never\r\ndepends on itself alone; the contraction of a muscle is induced by\r\na nerve stimulus or by an electric current; the activity of the\r\nnerve-cells of the brain requires the continual stimulus of the\r\nblood-stream, and cannot continue to exist without it; the specific\r\nsensory-nerves and sense-cells of the eye, ear, olfactory organ, and\r\nso on, are all prompted to activity by adequate stimuli. The same is\r\ntrue in regard to the determinants, they must be 'liberated' if they\r\nare to distribute themselves and migrate into the cell-body; and we\r\nhave to ask how that happens, whether it is possibly due only to their\r\nown internal condition, which again would, of course, depend on the\r\nnutritive conditions of the cell in which they lie, or whether it is\r\nperhaps due to some specific stimulus which is necessary in addition to\r\nthe fact of 'maturity,' just as a muscle is always ready to contract,\r\nyet only does so when it is affected by a specific stimulus.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first, therefore, I have considered whether it would\r\nnot be better to elaborate the determinant theory in such a way that\r\nit would not be necessary to assume a disintegration of the id in\r\nthe course of ontogeny, but simply to conceive of every expression\r\nof activity on the part of a determinant as dependent on a specific\r\nstimulus, which in many cases can only be supplied by a definite cell,\r\nthat is, by internal influences, and in other cases may be due to\r\nexternal influences.\r\n\r\nDarwin assumed the first of these alternatives in his theory of\r\nPangenesis, which we have still to outline. In it he attributes to\r\nhis 'gemmules' the power of giving rise to particular cells, which,\r\nhowever, they can only accomplish when they reach the cells which are\r\nthe genetic antecedents of those which the gemmules are to control.\r\nTranslated into the language of our theory this view would read\r\nas follows: the whole complex of determinants is contained within\r\nevery cell, as it is contained in the germ-cell, but at every stage\r\nof ontogeny, that is, in each of the developing cells, only the\r\ndeterminant which is to control the immediately successive cells is\r\n'liberated,' and that through the stimulus which the specific nature\r\nof the cell supplies to the determinant. In that case there would\r\nnecessarily be in every species of animal as many specific stimuli for\r\ndeterminants as there are determinants. This appeared to me improbable,\r\nand I rejected the hypothesis because of the enormous number of\r\nspecific stimuli which it demands, but also on other grounds which will\r\nbe touched upon in the course of these lectures.\r\n\r\nAlthough the assumption of an autonomic dissolution of the determinant\r\ncomplexes of the id in the course of ontogeny seems to me imperative,\r\nI do not by any means reject the interposition of liberating stimuli,\r\nindeed I regard their co-operation as indispensable. Later on we shall\r\ndiscuss cases in which it is definitely demonstrable that there may be\r\ntwo alternative sets of homologous determinants present in a cell, but\r\nthat on any occasion only one of these becomes active, a fact which we\r\ncan only explain on the assumption that only one of these is affected\r\nby the specific liberating stimulus. The phenomena of regeneration, of\r\npolymorphism, of germ-cell formation, &c., compel us to the assumption\r\nthat numerous cells, even after the completion of the building up of\r\nthe body, contain two or more kinds of determinants, as in a sense\r\ninactive 'accessory idioplasm,' each of which could control the cell\r\nalone, though in reality it only does control it when it is affected by\r\nthe appropriate liberating stimulus. I stated this view some years ago\r\nwhen I attempted to define more precisely the rôle played by 'external\r\ninfluences as developmental stimuli[21]'. It is not, then, that I\r\nunderrate the importance of external influences on the organism, but\r\nI believe that a still larger part of the determination of what shall\r\nhappen at a particular point depends on the primary constituents, and\r\nthat these are not alike at all parts of the body.\r\n\r\n[21] _Äussere Einflüsse als Entwicklungsreize_ [External Influences as\r\nStimuli to Development], Jena, 1894.\r\n\r\nAll living processes, therefore, both those of growing and of\r\ndifferentiation, depend always upon the interaction of external and\r\ninternal factors, of the environment and the living substance, and\r\nthe resultants of the interaction, namely, the structure of the body\r\nand its parts must necessarily turn out differently, not only when\r\nthe germ-substance is different, but when the essential conditions\r\nof development are changed. But that the constitution of the germ is\r\nby far the most potent factor, and that the nature of the results of\r\ndevelopment depends on it in a much greater degree than on the external\r\nconditions, has long been known. The conditions, such as warmth, may\r\nvary within certain limits, and yet the frog's egg becomes a frog;\r\nthough it does not follow that the result of development may not be\r\nmodified through certain changes in the conditions. The interesting\r\nexperiments made by Herbst with the eggs of sea-urchins have shown\r\nthat, in artificially altered sea-water in which sodium-salts are to a\r\nslight extent replaced by lithium-salts, these eggs develop into larvæ\r\nwhich only remotely suggest the normal structure, and diverge widely\r\nfrom it both in external shape and in the form of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nSuch larvæ are not able to survive, but soon perish; they are,\r\nhowever, of great interest from the point of view of our theory, for\r\nthey show that determinants do not bring forth the same structure\r\nunder all circumstances, but that, as I have already said, they are\r\nvital units of specific composition, which play a part in the course\r\nof development, and give rise under normal external influences to\r\nnormal parts, while under unusual influences, if these are not such\r\nas to prohibit development altogether, they may give rise to an\r\nabnormally formed part. It must not be forgotten that most composite\r\nparts--indeed, strictly speaking, all the parts--of an animal are not\r\ncontrolled by a single determinant, but by the many which successively\r\ndetermine the character of the cells and define the path of development\r\nof the part in question. There are no determinants of 'characters,'\r\nbut only of parts; the germ-plasm no more contains the determinants\r\nof a 'crooked nose' than it does those of a butterfly's tailed wing,\r\nbut it contains a number of determinants which so control the whole\r\ncell-group in all its successive stages, leading on to the development\r\nof the nose, that ultimately the crooked nose must result, just as the\r\nbutterfly's wing with all its veins, membranes, tracheæ, glandular\r\ncells, scales, pigment deposits, and pointed tail arises through the\r\nsuccessive interposition of numerous determinants in the course of\r\ncell-multiplication.\r\n\r\nBut in both processes we must presuppose _normal conditions of\r\ndevelopment_. In regard to the butterfly we know that abnormal\r\nconditions, such as cold during the pupal period, can cause\r\nconsiderable variation in the colour and marking of the wing, and in\r\nregard to the nose it can scarcely be doubted that, for instance,\r\npersistent pressure on the nasal region would result in a considerable\r\ndeviation from the hereditary form.\r\n\r\nThe case of the lithium-larvæ is similar. Here the chemical conditions\r\nof the first segmentation-cells are modified by the presence of the\r\nlithium-salts, and the determinants which make their way out of the\r\nnucleus in the first and in subsequent cell-generations find an\r\nunusual soil for their activity, which diverges further and further\r\nfrom the normal with each successive cell-generation. Thus the whole\r\nanimal is abnormally formed. The process may perhaps be compared to a\r\nplant which is negatively geotropic and positively heliotropic, that\r\nis, the stem of which tends to grow straight upwards, while all its\r\ngreen parts grow towards the light. If a plant of this kind have light\r\nshed on it from one side only, the stem with its leaves will grow\r\nobliquely towards that side. If the plant be then turned round so that\r\nit receives light from the other side, the stem in its further growth\r\nwill curve in a direction opposite to that which it took before, and so\r\nby continually changing the position of the plant in relation to the\r\nlight one could--theoretically at least--produce a plant with a zigzag\r\nstem. But this would not furnish any evidence against the presence of\r\ndeterminants; there are no 'upright determinants' any more than there\r\nare 'zigzag determinants' or 'crooked nose determinants,' but there are\r\ndeterminants controlling the nature of the cells which give rise, under\r\nnormal conditions of development, to the straight stem, under abnormal\r\nconditions to the zigzag stem, or to a flat nose instead of a crooked\r\none, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis consideration should make it clear that plant-galls are not in\r\nthe remotest degree a stone of stumbling for the determinant theory,\r\nas some have supposed. Of course there can be no 'gall-determinants,'\r\nfor galls are not transmissible adaptations of the plants on which they\r\noccur; they arise solely through the larvæ of the gall-insect which\r\nhas laid its eggs within the tissues of the plant. But the specific\r\nnature of the different kinds of plant-cells, predetermined by their\r\ndeterminants, is such that, through the abnormal influences exercised\r\nupon them by the larvæ, they are compelled to a special reaction which\r\nresults in the formation of galls. It is marvellous enough that these\r\nabnormal stimuli should be so precisely graded and adjusted that such a\r\nspecifically definite structure should result, and in this case there\r\nis obviously a very different state of matters from that obtaining in\r\nmost other processes of development, in which the chief determining\r\nfactor is rather implied in the nature of the idioplasm, that is, of\r\nthe determinants, than in the nature of the external influences. Here,\r\nhowever, the specific structure of the gall depends mainly on the\r\nquality, variety, and successive effects of the external influences or\r\nstimuli. In discussing the influences of surroundings I shall return\r\nonce more to the galls.\r\n\r\nMy determinants have generally been regarded as if they were like\r\ngrains of seed, from which either nothing may arise, under unfavourable\r\nconditions, or just the particular kind of plant from which the seed\r\nitself originated.\r\n\r\nThis simile is, however, to be taken _cum grano salis_. The whole ovum\r\nis certainly comparable to a grain of seed, but single determinants\r\nor groups of determinants will always be able to adapt themselves\r\nto different influences, and to remain active even under slightly\r\nabnormal conditions, though in that case the resulting structures may\r\nbe somewhat divergent. This relative plasticity is indispensable even\r\nin relation to the ceaseless mutual adaptations of the growing parts\r\nof the organism. Not only do the cells which live beside each other\r\nat the same time influence each other mutually, but the influence\r\nextends to the whole cell-lineage. No cell or group of cells develops\r\nindependently of all the others in the body, but each has its ancestral\r\nseries of cells on whose determinants it is so far dependent, since\r\nthese have taken part in determining its own nature, in, so to speak,\r\nsupplying the soil in which ultimately its own determinants will\r\nbe sown from the nucleus, and whose influence modifies these last\r\naccording to its quality. We might therefore say that every part is\r\ndetermined by all the determinants of its cell-ancestors.\r\n\r\nIf there be urged against the doctrine of determinants the undoubted\r\nfact of the dependence of individual development on external\r\nconditions, or the capacity that organisms have of functional\r\nadaptation, or especially the power that some parts of the organism\r\nhave of taking a different form in response to different stimuli, I can\r\nonly say that I see no reason why certain cells and masses of cells\r\nshould not be adapted from the first for responding differently to\r\ndifferent stimuli.\r\n\r\nTherefore I see no contradiction of the determinant theory when, for\r\ninstance, among the higher vertebrates, the cells of the connective\r\ntissue exhibit a great diversity of form, becoming a loose 'filling'\r\nconnective tissue in one place, a tense fascia, ligament, or tendon\r\ntissue in another, according as they are subjected to slight pressure\r\non all sides or to stronger pressure on one side. I see no difficulty\r\nin the fact that this connective tissue forms in one case bone-tissue\r\nwith the most accurate adaptation of its microscopic structure to the\r\nconditions of stress and pressure which affect the relevant spot,\r\nor in another case cartilaginous tissue, when the cells are exposed\r\nto varying pressure (as on the surface of joints), or even that it\r\ngives rise to blood-vessels when the pressure of the circulating\r\nblood and the tension of the surrounding tissues supply the necessary\r\nstimulus. It is easy to see how important, indeed how necessary, the\r\nmany-sidedness of these cells is for the organism, even leaving out\r\nof account such violent interference as the breaking of a bone, the\r\nirregular healing of broken ends of bones, new joint formation, and\r\nso on, and thinking only of the normal phenomena of growth. While the\r\nbone grows it is continually breaking up in the inside and forming anew\r\non the surface, and this occurs through the power of the connective\r\ntissue-cells to form different tissues under different influences or\r\nstimuli.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore assume that there are side by side in the connective\r\ncells of higher vertebrates determinants of bone, of cartilage, of\r\nconnective tissue in the narrower sense, and of blood-vessels, and\r\nthat one or other of these is liberated to activity according to the\r\nstimulus affecting it. Phenomena occur also in the development of lower\r\nanimals which lead us to the same assumption.\r\n\r\nAmong these is the remarkable behaviour of the primary mesoderm-cells\r\nin the young embryo (gastrula) of the Echinoderms (Fig. 92). At the\r\npoint where the primitive gut or archenteron invaginates into the\r\ninterior of the hitherto single-layered blastula (Fig. 92, _A_), some\r\ncells are separated off (_M_), and move independently, constantly\r\nmultiplying the while, into the clear gelatinous fluid (_G_) which\r\nfills the cavity of the larva, and there they fix themselves, some\r\non the outer ectodermic layer, others to the various regions and\r\noutgrowths of the archenteron (_Ms_). According as these cells have\r\nestablished themselves at one or another point, they become connective\r\ntissue, muscle, or skeleton cells of the dermis, or contribute to\r\nthe muscular layer of the food-canal and water-vascular system, or,\r\nfinally, become skeleton-forming cells of the calcareous ring which\r\nsurrounds the gullet of the sea-cucumber. In all this there is nothing\r\nto indicate a determination of the cells in one direction; on the\r\ncontrary it seems as if the fate of the individual cells depended on\r\nthe chance conditions which may lead them to one place or to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92. Echinoderm-larvæ. _A_, blastula-stage; the\r\nprimary mesoderm-cells (_M_) are being formed at the subsequent\r\ninvagination-area of the endoderm (_Ent_). _Ekt_, the ectoderm. _B_,\r\ngastrula-stage; the archenteron (_UD_) has been invaginated (_Ent_),\r\nand between it and the ectoderm (_Ekt_) the mesoderm-cells (_Ms_)\r\nmigrate into the gelatinous fluid which fills this cavity. There they\r\nattach themselves partly to the ectoderm, and partly to the endoderm.\r\nAfter Selenka.]\r\n\r\nThere are thus three possibilities of development, three kinds of\r\nreaction, implied in these cells, which are all outwardly alike, and\r\nwe can only understand their rôle in the building up of this very\r\nsymmetrical animal if we assume that of these three only one is in\r\neach case liberated, by the specific stimulus exerted by the immediate\r\nsurroundings of the cell, so that it may become, according to the\r\nchance position it takes up after its migration, either a skin-cell, a\r\nmuscle-cell, or a skeleton-forming cell.\r\n\r\nThis case may be compared in some respects with the permanent\r\ncolour-adaptation of those caterpillars, in regard to which Poulton\r\ndemonstrated that they become almost black if they are reared on\r\nblackish-brown bark, light brown on light bark, and green if they are\r\nkept among leaves, and in all cases permanently so. In this case also\r\nthe implicated pigment-cells of the skin may develop in three ways,\r\naccording to whether this or that quality of the light releases this or\r\nthat determinant.\r\n\r\nBut in many cases we do not know the quality of the liberating\r\nstimulus, and must content ourselves with imagining it. This is so in\r\nthe case of dimorphism of the sexes. It is clear that in the males\r\nof a species the germ-cells develop quite otherwise than they do in\r\nthe females, that different determining elements attain to activity\r\nin each sex, and since the primary constituents of both sexes must be\r\ncontained in most animals in the ovum and in the spermatozoon, we must\r\nassume that in both there are at once 'ovogenic' and 'spermogenic'\r\ndeterminants, of which, however, only _one_ kind becomes active in a\r\ngiven individual. There are, however, both among plants and animals\r\nhermaphrodite individuals, in which both kinds of sexual products are\r\ndeveloped simultaneously or successively.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the primary sexual characters, however, that compel\r\nus to the assumption of double determinants in the germ-plasm, the\r\nsecondary sexual characters do so too. We know very well in relation\r\nto ourselves that 'the beautiful soprano voice of the mother may be\r\ntransmitted through the son to the grand-daughter, and that the black\r\nbeard of the father may pass through the daughter to the grandson.'\r\nThus both kinds of sexual characters _must be present in every sexually\r\ndifferentiated being_, some visible, others latent. In animals the\r\ndeterminants are sometimes handed on from germ-plasm to germ-plasm\r\nthrough several generations in a latent state, and only make their\r\nappearance again in a subsequent generation. This is the case in the\r\nwater-fleas (Daphnids) and the plant-lice (Aphides), in which several\r\nexclusively female generations succeed one another, and only in the\r\nlast of them do males occur again side by side with the females.\r\n\r\nThe germ-plasm of the ovum which is ripe for development must thus\r\ncontain not only the determinants of the specific ova and sperms of the\r\nspecies, but also those of all the male and female sexual characters,\r\nwhich we discussed at length in the section on sexual selection. I\r\nthen showed that these secondary sexual characters differ greatly\r\nin range and in strength, that among lower animals they are almost\r\nentirely absent, and that among higher forms, such Crustaceans,\r\nInsects, and Birds, they attain to very different grades of development\r\neven among the same species. Thus the birds of Paradise are in most\r\nspecies brilliantly coloured and adorned with decorative feathers\r\nonly in the male sex, while the females are simply blackish-grey, but\r\nthere is a single species in which the males are almost as soberly\r\ncoloured as the females. Conversely, too, we find that in parrots both\r\nsexes are usually coloured alike, but a few species exhibit a totally\r\ndifferent colouring in the two sexes. In the same way the secondary sex\r\ndifferences may affect only a few parts of the animal or many, while\r\nin a few species the sexes are so divergent in structure that almost\r\neverything about them may be called different. Examples of this are\r\nthe dwarf males of most Rotifers, and the males, more minute still in\r\nproportion to the females, of the marine worm _Bonellia viridis_ (p.\r\n227).\r\n\r\nWe have now to inquire what theoretical explanation of these facts we\r\ncan arrive at in accordance with the germ-plasm theory. That double\r\ndeterminants, male and female, for the differently formed parts of the\r\ntwo sexes must be assumed to exist in the germ-plasm has been already\r\nsaid, and we have to suppose that the same stimulus--usually unknown\r\nto us--which incites the determinants of the primary sexual characters\r\nto activity also liberates those of the secondary characters. But we\r\nmay safely go a step further and conclude that there are male and\r\nfemale _ids_, that is, that the male and female determinants belong\r\nto different ids. I infer this from the fact that in some groups,\r\nsuch as the Rotifers and certain plant-lice, the ova are sexually\r\ndifferentiated even at the time of their origin. Males and females\r\nof these animals arise from different kinds of eggs, which are even\r\nexternally recognizable. Both develop parthenogenetically, so that\r\nfertilization has nothing to do with it; from the first, therefore,\r\nthey must contain ids which consist of determinants of one sex alone.\r\n\r\nIf this conclusion be correct, then the sexual equipment of the\r\ndeterminants of the sexual characters must have taken place in the\r\ncourse of phylogeny in such a way that each id was affected in one\r\ndirection only, and we should thus have to assume male and female ids,\r\neven before the separation of the sexes as males and females, and the\r\nsame conclusion must be extended to the primary sexual characters. Only\r\nin this way can we understand the fact that differences between the\r\nsexes, at first small, have increased in the course of phylogeny to\r\nsuch complete divergence of structure as is now exhibited in the forms\r\nwe have named, _Bonellia_, the Rotifers, and some parasitic worms.\r\n\r\nBut there is not only sexual dimorphism, there is also dimorphism\r\nof larvæ, e.g. green and brown caterpillars in certain species of\r\nhawk-moth (_Sphinx_), and there are sometimes not only two but three\r\nor more forms of a species; and in all these cases determinants of the\r\ndifferential parts must be represented twice, thrice, or several times\r\nin each germ-plasm, in each fertilized ovum, at least in all cases in\r\nwhich the different forms live together on the same area. In discussing\r\nmimicry we spoke of species of butterfly which were everywhere alike\r\nor nearly so in the male sex, while the females were not only quite\r\ndifferent from the males, but differed greatly in many respects among\r\nthemselves. Three different forms of females of _Papilio merope_ occur\r\nin the same region of Cape Colony, each of these resembling a protected\r\nmodel. All three forms have been obtained from the eggs of one female.\r\nIn this case the female ids of the germ-plasm must be represented by\r\nthree different sets, one of which, when it is in the majority in the\r\nfertilized ovum, gives rise to the _Danais_-form, the second to the\r\n_Niavius_-form, and the third to the _Echeria_-form of the species.\r\nPhylogenetically considered, it is probable that each of these three\r\nkinds of ids originated by itself, on a more limited area on which the\r\nprotected model lived in abundance; but with a wider distribution the\r\ndifferent female ids mingled together, were united through the males\r\ninto a single germ-plasm, and now occasionally exhibit all three forms\r\non the same area. I doubt whether there is any other theory that can\r\noffer an interpretation of these facts, and I regard them, therefore,\r\nas affording further evidence of the real existence of ids.\r\n\r\nThe polymorphism of social insects must be thought of as similarly\r\nbased in the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nIn bees there are in addition to the males and females the so-called\r\nworkers, and this can only depend on the existence of special kinds\r\nof ids. Those of the workers were originally truly female, but as\r\nmany of their determinants underwent variations advantageous for\r\nthe maintenance of the species, they were modified into special\r\n'worker-ids.' I postpone for the present any inquiry into the causes by\r\nwhich these ids come to dominate the ontogeny; obviously it cannot be\r\nby the mere fact of being in a majority over the rest of the ids, as I\r\nindicated in the case of the butterflies with polymorphic females.\r\n\r\nIn many ants the division of labour goes further still; there are two\r\nkinds of workers in the colony, the ordinary workers and the so-called\r\n'soldiers,' and in this case the worker-id must have developed in two\r\ndifferent directions in the course of phylogeny, and have separated\r\ninto two kinds of ids, so that the germ-plasm of these species must\r\ncontain four kinds of ids.\r\n\r\nI might cite many more cases in regard to which the assumption of two\r\nor more kinds of determinants seems imperative, but I believe that what\r\nhas been said is enough to enable any one to think out other cases for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XIX\r\n\r\nTHE GERM-PLASM THEORY (_continued_)\r\n\r\n Co-operation of the determinants to form an organ: insect\r\n appendages--Venation of the insect-wing--Deformities in\r\n Man--Apex of the fly's leg--Proofs of the existence of\r\n determinants--Claws and adhesive lobes--Difference between a\r\n theory of development and a theory of heredity--Metamorphosis of\r\n the food-canal in insects--Delage's theory--Reinke's theory of the\r\n organism-machine--Fechner's views--Apparent contradiction by the facts\r\n of developmental mechanics--Formation of the germ-cells--Displacement\r\n of the germinal areas in the hydro-medusoid polyps, a proof of the\r\n existence of germ-tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT would be futile to attempt to guess at the arrangement of the\r\ndeterminants in the germ-plasm, but so much at least we may say, that\r\nthe determinants do not lie beside each other in the same disposition\r\nas their determinates exhibit in the fully-formed organism. This may be\r\ninferred from the complex formative processes of embryogenesis in which\r\nmany groups of cells, which in their origin were far apart, combine\r\ntogether to form an organ. Thus the arrangement of the determinants\r\nin the germ-plasm does not correspond to the subsequent arrangement\r\nof the whole animal, nor are primary constituents of the _complete_\r\norgans contained within the germ-plasm. The organ is undoubtedly\r\n_predetermined_ in the germ-plasm, but it is not _preformed_ as such.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the history of development gives us a certain basis of\r\nfact from which to work. Let us consider, for instance, the origin\r\nof the appendages in those insects which in the larval state possess\r\nneither legs nor wings, but exhibit a gradual emergence of these\r\nstructures from concealment underneath the integumentary skeleton.\r\nIn these cases, as I have already shown in regard to the wings, the\r\ndevelopment of the limbs arises from definite groups of cells in the\r\nskin. These must therefore be regarded as the formative, and therefore\r\nas the most important and indispensable, parts of the rudiments, and\r\nmay be designated the imaginal disks, as I many years ago proposed[22]\r\n(Fig. 89, _ui_ and _oi_).\r\n\r\n[22] _Die Entwicklung der Dipteren_, Leipzig, 1864.\r\n\r\nBut these disks of cells do not contain the _whole_ leg, but only the\r\nskin-layer of it, the 'hypodermis,' which, however, in this case\r\nundoubtedly determines the form. But the internal parts of the leg,\r\nespecially the nerves, tracheæ, and probably also the muscles, are\r\nformed from other cell-groups and grow into the imaginal disk from\r\noutside. Something similar probably takes place in the case of all\r\norgans which are made up of many parts; they are, so to speak, shot\r\ntogether from several points of origin, from various primordia; and\r\ndeterminants are brought into co-operation whose relative value in\r\ndetermining the form and function of the organ may be very diverse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89. Anterior region of the larva of a Midge\r\n(_Corethra plumicornis_). _K_, head. _Th_, thorax. _ui_, inferior\r\nimaginal disks. _oi_, superior imaginal disks. _ui_^1, _ui_^2, and\r\n_ui_^3, the primordia of the limbs. _oi_^2 and _oi_^3, the primordia of\r\nthe wings and 'balancers.' _g_, brain. _bg_, chain of ventral ganglia\r\nwith nerves which enter the imaginal disks. _trb_, tracheal vesicle.\r\nEnlarged about 15 times.]\r\n\r\nFor it is undoubtedly a very different matter whether a cell bears\r\nwithin it the elements which compel it in the course of growth\r\nto develop an organ, for instance a leg, of quite definite size,\r\nsculpture, number of joints, and so on, or whether it only bears the\r\nsomewhat vague power of determining that connective tissue or fatty\r\ntissue is to be produced. In the first case it controls the whole\r\nformation of the part, in the second it only fills up gaps or lays\r\ndown fat or other substances within itself if these be presented\r\nto it. Between these two extremes of determining power there are\r\nmany intermediate stages. Cells which contain the determinants of\r\nblood-vessels, tracheæ, or nerves need not be so definitely determined\r\nthat they always give rise to precisely the same blood-vessels, the\r\nsame branching of the tracheæ, or the same bifurcation of nerves; they\r\nmay probably possess no more than the general tendency to the formation\r\nof such parts, and the special form taken by the nerves, tracheæ, or\r\nblood-vessels may be essentially determined by their environment. Thus\r\nin the morbid tumours of Man, nerves, and especially blood-vessels,\r\nmay develop in a quite characteristic manner, which was certainly not\r\ndetermined in advance, but has been called forth by the stimulus, the\r\npressure, and other influences of the cellular basis of the tumour.\r\nIn short, the cells were only determined to this extent, that they\r\ncontained the tendency to give rise to blood-vessels under particular\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to think of the primary constituents\r\nof all cell-groups as so indefinite. Let us call to mind, for instance,\r\nthe venation of the insect wing. It is well known that this is not\r\nonly quite different in beetles, bugs, and Diptera from that in the\r\nHymenoptera, and different again in the butterflies, but that it is\r\nquite characteristic in every individual family of butterflies, and\r\nindeed in every genus. We cannot conceive of the absolute certainty of\r\ndevelopment of these very characteristic and constant branchings as\r\nhaving its roots elsewhere than in the determinants of the germ-plasm,\r\nwhich, lying within certain series of cells, ultimately cause\r\nparticular cell-series of the wing-rudiment to become the wing-veins.\r\nIf this were not so, how would it be possible to understand the fact\r\nthat every minute deviation in the course of these veins is repeated\r\nin exactly the same way in all the individuals of a genus, while in\r\nall the individuals of an allied genus the venation turns out slightly\r\ndifferent with equal constancy.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite certain that all determinations are in some degree\r\nsusceptible to modifying influences, that they are in very different\r\ndegrees capable of variation.\r\n\r\nMany deformities of particular parts in Man and the higher animals\r\nmay be referred to imperfect or inhibited nutrition of the part\r\nin question during embryonic development; the determinants alone\r\ncannot make the part, they must have a supply of formative material,\r\nand according as this material is afforded more abundantly or more\r\nscantily the part will turn out larger or smaller. In the same way the\r\npressure conditions of the surrounding parts must in many cases have a\r\nfurthering or inhibiting influence, or may even determine the shape.\r\nBut it is quite possible, indeed even probable, that other specific\r\ninfluences are exerted by the cells or cell-aggregates surrounding an\r\norgan which is in process of being formed, just as the stake on which a\r\ntwining plant is growing may prompt it to coil. If the stake be absent,\r\nthe predetermined twining of the plant cannot attain to more than very\r\nimperfect expression, if indeed it finds any. The spirally coiled\r\nsheath of muscle-cells which occurs so often around blood-vessels\r\nin worms, Echinoderms, and Vertebrates is probably due to similar\r\nprocesses, that is, on the one hand, to a specific mode of reaction\r\ncharacteristic of these cells, and predetermined from the germ; on the\r\nother hand, to the external influence of the cell-surroundings without\r\nwhich the determination of the muscle-cell is not liberated, that is,\r\nis not excited to activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93. The development of a limb in the pupa of a Fly\r\n(_Sarcophaga carnaria_). _A_, apex of the limb from a pupa four days\r\nold; the jointing is hinted at; _hy_, hypodermis; _ps_, pupal sheath;\r\n_ph_, phagocytes; _tr_, tracheal branch. _B_, the same on the fifth\r\nday; the lumen of the limb is quite filled with phagocytes (_ph_); the\r\nlast tarsal joint (_t_^5) is beginning to show a bifid apex. _C_, the\r\nsame on the seventh day; the claws (_Kr_) and the adhesive lobes (_hl_)\r\nare formed.]\r\n\r\nBut even if every determinant requires a stimulus to liberate it,\r\nwhether this stimulus consists in currents of particular nutritive\r\nfluids, in contact with other cells, or, conversely, on the removal\r\nof some pressure previously exerted on the cell by its surroundings,\r\nthe material cause of a structure is to be sought for not in these\r\nconditions of its appearance, but in the primary constituents which\r\nhave been handed on to the relevant cell or cell-group from the germ,\r\nin other words, through its determinants. How, for instance, could\r\nthe blunt rounded knob of the rough and clumsily jointed sac of cells\r\nwhich represents the insect's leg at the beginning of the pupal period\r\n(Fig. 93, _A_) be incited to thicken, to constrict at the root (_B_),\r\nand to form a joint-surface, to broaden out at the end, and produce\r\ntwo sharply cut points (_C_), which become incurved and form claws\r\n(_kr_), while beneath these a broad flat lobe (_hl_) grows forward, and\r\nwith its regularly disposed cells gradually forms the characteristic\r\nadhesive organ of the fly--how could all this happen if there were not\r\ncontained within these cells special formative forces which determine\r\nthem not only in their form and the rest of their constitution, but\r\nabove all in their power of multiplication? No special external\r\nstimulus affects the still unfinished knob of the fly's leg unless it\r\nbe the removal of pressure; but this operates regularly, and cannot\r\nbe the cause of the growth, at definite places, of claws and adhesive\r\nlobes with all their characteristically placed hairs.\r\n\r\nWe require to assume that each of the cells composing the primary\r\nrudiment of the limb possessed a determining power which made it grow\r\nand multiply under the given conditions of nutrition and pressure in a\r\nprescribed manner and at a prescribed rate; and we must make the same\r\nassumption in regard to all the daughter and grand-daughter-cells,\r\nand so on. The strictest regulation of the power of multiplication of\r\neach of the implicated cells is a necessary condition of the constant\r\nproduction of the same two claws and adhesive lobes, the same form of\r\ntarsal joint, the same regular covering of hair, and so on. This exact\r\ndetermination of the cells can only take place through material vital\r\nparticles, and it is these which I call determinants.\r\n\r\nI have already said so much about the assumed 'determinants' of the\r\ngerm-plasm that it might perhaps be supposed that we have now exhausted\r\nthe topic; but the assumption of such 'primary constituents' is so\r\nfundamental, not only for my own germ-plasm theory of to-day and\r\nto-morrow, but also--unless I am much mistaken--for all future theories\r\nof development and inheritance. In point of fact, the conception of\r\ndeterminants has as yet penetrated so little into the consciousness of\r\nbiologists, that I cannot remain content with what I have already said,\r\nbut must endeavour to test and to corroborate my thesis by additional\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware, only a few zoologists have expressly and\r\nunconditionally agreed with the assumption of determinants; on the\r\nother hand, several biologists have rejected it as fanciful and\r\nuntenable, while others have set it aside as a useless playing with\r\nideas. The last, I am inclined to believe, have not taken the trouble\r\nto think out what the idea is. It has even been objected that there\r\ncan be no determinants because we can see nothing of them, and that\r\nthey must therefore be pure figments of the imagination, invented to\r\nexplain facts which could be explained much more easily and simply in\r\nsome other way. From the very first I have stated emphatically that\r\nthey have not been, and never will be seen, because they lie far below\r\nthe limit of visibility, and thus can at best only become visible\r\nwhen they are collected in large aggregates like chromatin granules.\r\nNor have I any objections to make if any one chooses to describe all\r\nthe details of their activity as mere hypotheses, such, for instance,\r\nas their distribution during development, their 'maturation,' their\r\nmigration from the nucleus, and the manner in which they control the\r\ncell. All this is really an imaginative picture which may be correct\r\nto a certain degree, but may also be erroneous; no formal proof of it\r\ncan be obtained at present; and I am content if it be simply admitted\r\nto be possible. On the other hand, the existence of determinants seems\r\nto me to be, in the sense indicated, indubitable and demonstrable.\r\n\r\nLet us return for a moment to the claws and adhesive lobes which\r\nare developed on the foot of the fly. It may perhaps be thought\r\nthat it is possible to do without the assumption of determinants\r\nfor these parts, by assuming that although 'external' influences in\r\nthe ordinary sense could not possibly have determined that certain\r\ncells of the apex of the leg should form claws and others adhesive\r\nlobes, the result might be due to the differences of intercellular\r\npressure within the apical knob; these may have been stronger in one\r\ndirection, weaker in another, thus prompting the cells to grow here\r\ninto claws and there into adhesive lobes. If we had merely to explain\r\nfrom the constitution of the germ-plasm the ontogeny or development\r\nof these parts in an individual fly there might perhaps be no radical\r\nobjection to this view, though it would hardly be possible to explain\r\nthe assumed differences in pressure otherwise than as due to a\r\ndifferent intensity of growth in the cells in the various regions of\r\nthe limb-apex, which again would have to be referred to differences in\r\nthe germ-plasm. But when we reflect that these parts vary hereditarily\r\nand independently of other parts, and owe their present form to their\r\npower of doing so, and that they are differently formed in every\r\ngenus and species, we see at once that they must be represented in\r\nthe germ-plasm by particular vital particles, which are the roots of\r\ntheir transmissible variability, that is, which must have previously\r\nundergone a corresponding variation if the relevant parts themselves\r\nare to vary. Without previous variation of the determinants of the germ\r\nno transmissible independent deviation on the part of the claws or\r\nadhesive lobes of the animal is conceivable.\r\n\r\nAll the opponents of my theory have overlooked this fact; both Oscar\r\nHertwig and Kassowitz have forgotten that a theory of development\r\nis not a theory of heredity; they only aim at the former, and\r\nthey therefore dispute the logical necessity for an assumption of\r\ndeterminants.\r\n\r\nBut as this is the very foundation of the theory, let me further submit\r\nthe following considerations in its favour.\r\n\r\nIn insects which undergo metamorphosis, not only the external but the\r\ninternal parts of the caterpillar or larva go through a more or less\r\ncomplete transformation. In the flies (Muscidæ), for instance, the\r\nwhole intestinal tract of the larva is reconstructed in the pupa; in\r\nfact it breaks up into a loose, flocculent, dead, but still coherent\r\nmass of tissue. Within this there arises a new intestine, as I have\r\nshown in an early work (1864); and Kowalewsky and Van Rees have since\r\nmade us aware of the interesting details of this reconstruction,\r\nshowing that the new intestine arises from definite cells of the\r\nold one, which are present in the larval gut at certain fairly wide\r\ndistances, and which do not share in the general destruction, but\r\nremain alive, grow, and multiply, and form islands of cells in the dead\r\nmass. These living islands, continually extending, ultimately come\r\ninto contact and again form a closed intestinal canal which differs\r\nentirely from that of the larva in its form, in its various areas,\r\nand in its differentiation. In this case those formative cells of the\r\nimago-intestine must have contained the elements which determined\r\ntheir descendants in number, power of multiplication, arrangement,\r\nand histological differentiation. In other words, each of these\r\ncells must contain the determinants of a particular limited section\r\nof the intestine of the imago. The other cells of the intestinal\r\nepithelium could not do this, even though they were under exactly the\r\nsame conditions, were included in the same intimate cell-aggregate,\r\nand had the same nutritional opportunities. They break up when the\r\nformative cells begin to be active, for till then the latter had\r\nremained inactive, and had not multiplied, although they lay regularly\r\ndistributed among the other cells. Whence, then, could the entire\r\ndifference in the behaviour of these two sets of cells arise, if it\r\ndoes not depend on the _nature of the cells themselves_, and how could\r\nthis difference of nature have developed during the racial history of\r\ninsect-metamorphosis if determinants did not reach the cell from the\r\ngerm-plasm--determinants which conditioned that some cells should be\r\nhereditarily modified into the cells of the imago-intestine and others\r\ninto the larval intestine? Quite similar processes have been recently\r\ndemonstrated in regard to the reconstruction of the larval intestine\r\nin other insect-groups. Deegener has done this, for instance, for the\r\nwater-beetle (_Hydrophilus piceus_); and it is certain that all these\r\nreconstructions start from particular cells, which lie indifferently\r\nbetween the active cells during the larval period, and contain the\r\nprimary constituents for the formation of a section of the intestine,\r\nbut which only become active when their hitherto living neighbours die\r\nand break up.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the reconstruction of the external form of the fly takes\r\nplace in a similar manner. Not only the limb, the head, the stigmata,\r\nbut the skin itself is formed anew from imaginal disks. In each of\r\nthe abdominal segments three pairs of little cell-islands are formed\r\nduring larval life, and these only enter on the stage of formative\r\nactivity after pupation, when they multiply rapidly and grow together\r\nto form a segment, whose size, form, and external nature is determined\r\nby them. But it is well known that the abdominal segments of the fly\r\ndiffer from those of the larva very markedly and in every respect,\r\nso that each cell-island must contain determinants which are quite\r\ndifferent from those in the skin-cells of the corresponding larval\r\nsegments. These last break up at the beginning of pupahood, while the\r\nformer begin to grow vigorously, and to spread themselves out. The most\r\nremarkable fact about the whole business, and it seems to me also the\r\nmost instructive, is that these imaginal disks frequently appear for\r\nthe first time during larval life, as I found in the case of a midge,\r\n_Coretha plumicornis_, in regard to the disks of the thorax, and as\r\nBruno Wahl[23] has recently demonstrated in the case of the abdominal\r\ncell-islands. Since in the young larva the position of the subsequent\r\nimaginal disks is occupied by cells which apparently in no way differ\r\nfrom the rest of the skin-cells, and are also exposed to precisely the\r\nsame external and internal influences, the origination of the imaginal\r\ncells from these can only depend on differential cell-division; the\r\nprimordial cell of each imaginal disk must have separated at the\r\nbeginning of disk-formation into a larval and an imaginal skin-cell.\r\n\r\n[23] Bruno Wahl, _Ueber die Entwickelung der hypodermalen\r\nImaginalscheiben im Thorax und Abdomen der Larve von 'Eristalis' L.,\r\nZeitschr. f. wiss. Zool._, Bd. lxx. 1901.\r\n\r\nIn insects in which the larva and the imago differ widely, the perfect\r\ninsect, as regards all its principal parts, is already represented\r\nin the larva, namely, in particular cells which lie among those of\r\nthe corresponding larval parts, and do not visibly differ from these,\r\nalthough they are equipped with quite different determinants, and\r\nconsequently enter on their formative activity much later, and give\r\nrise to quite different structures. As the determinants of the whole\r\nanimal with all its parts are contained in the ovum, so those of\r\nthe parts of its imaginal phase are contained in these cells of the\r\nimaginal disks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, we have incontrovertible evidence in favour\r\nof the theory of determinants in the independent phyletic variations\r\nof the individual stages of development, on which depends the whole\r\nphenomenon of 'metamorphosis' which we have just been considering. How\r\ncould the larval stage have become so different from the imago-stage,\r\nif the one were not alterable by variation arising in the germ\r\nwithout the other being affected? If this absolute independence of\r\nthe transmissible variability of the individual stages were not an\r\nindispensable assumption in the explanation of metamorphosis and other\r\nphenomena of development, I should regard an attempt at a theory of\r\ndevelopment without determinants as justifiable. But I am forced to\r\nsee in this fact alone an invalidation of all epigenetic theories of\r\ndevelopment, that is, of all theories which assume a germ-substance\r\nwithout primary constituents, which can produce the complicated\r\nbody solely by varying step by step under the influence of external\r\ninfluences, both extra- and intra-somatic. It is possible to conceive\r\nof an ovum in which the living substance is of such a kind that it\r\nmust vary in a definite manner under the influence of warmth, air,\r\npressure, and so on, that it must divide into similar, and subsequently\r\nalso into dissimilar parts, which then interact upon each other in\r\ndiverse ways and give rise to further variations, which in their turn\r\nresult in differentiations and variations, till ultimately we have the\r\nwhole complicated organic machine complete and 'finished' in every\r\ndetail. Certainly no mortal could make any pronouncement as to the\r\nconstitution of such a substance, but even if we assume it, for the\r\nnonce, as possible, how can we account for the transmissible variation\r\nof the individual parts and developmental stages, on which the whole\r\nphylogenetic evolution depends?\r\n\r\nAs the development of the butterfly exhibits the three main stages of\r\ncaterpillar, pupa, and perfect insect, each of which is independently\r\nand hereditarily variable, and therefore implies a something in the\r\ngerm, whose variation brings about a change in the one stage only, so\r\nthe ontogeny of every higher animal is made up of numerous stages,\r\nwhich are all capable of independent and transmissible variation. How\r\nelse should we human beings, in our embryonic phase, still possess the\r\ngill-arches of our fish-like ancestors, although much modified and\r\nwithout the gills? Truly, he who would seek to deny that the stages of\r\nindividual development are capable of independent and transmissible\r\nvariation must know very little about embryology. But if the facts\r\nare as stated, how can they be reconciled with the conception of a\r\ngerminal substance developing in epigenetic fashion? Every variation\r\nin this substance would affect not only the whole _succession of\r\nstages, but the whole organism with all its parts_. In this way too,\r\nthen, we are driven to the conclusion that there must be something in\r\nthe germ whose variation causes variation only in a particular part\r\nof a particular stage. This something we define in our conception of\r\nthe 'primary constituents' (_Anlagen_)--the determinants. These are\r\nnot to be thought of either as 'miniature models,' or even as the\r\n'seeds' of the parts; they alone cannot produce the part which they\r\ndetermine, but they effect changes in the cell in which they become\r\nactive, causing it to vary in such a manner that the formation of the\r\nrelevant part results. While I conceive of development as a continuous\r\nprocess, I supplement this with the idea that from within, namely, from\r\nthe nuclear substance, new, directive, 'determining' influences are\r\ncontinually being exerted on the developing cells.\r\n\r\nI can hardly think of a better proof of the necessity of this\r\nassumption than that furnished by Delage, one of the most acute\r\nbiologists of France, who, in his comprehensive book on _Heredity_, has\r\nstriven to replace the theory of determinants by something simpler.\r\nDelage rejects all 'primary constituents' (_Anlagen_) in the germ, all\r\n'particules représentatives,' as much too complicated an assumption,\r\nand thinks it possible to work with the conception of a germ-plasm\r\nwhich is about as simple as the cell-substance of a Rhizopod, that\r\nis to say, a protoplasm of definite chemico-physical constitution\r\nand composition. Leaving out of account the consideration that the\r\nprotoplasm of an amœba is scarcely of such extreme simplicity, but is\r\ncertainly made up of numerous differentiated and definitely arranged\r\nbiophors, how could such an extremely simple ('éminemment simple')\r\nconstitution of the ovum as is here assumed give rise to such a\r\ncomplicated organism, the individual parts of which are capable of\r\nindependent and transmissible variation? According to Delage it does so\r\nbecause the ovum, though not containing 'all the factors requisite for\r\nits ultimate resultant,' does contain 'un certain nombre des facteurs\r\nnécessaires à la détermination de chaque partie et de chaque caractère\r\nde l'organisme futur'! Determinants after all, it may be said, but\r\nthat is far from the truth! It is not primary constituents that the\r\ngerm contains, according to Delage, it is chemical substances, for\r\ninstance muscle substances, probably 'les substances caractéristiques\r\ndes principales catégories de cellules, c'est-à-dire, celles qui, dans\r\nces cellules, sont la condition principale de leur fonctionnement.' All\r\nthese must be contained in the ovum. How they are to reach their proper\r\nplace in the organism, how the 'characteristic chemical substance' of a\r\nmole is to land just behind the right or left ear of the fully formed\r\nman, is not stated. But apart from this, there is a much deeper error\r\nin this assumption of specific chemical substances in the ovum as an\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of local hereditary variation, and I have\r\nalready touched upon it: chemical substances are not vital units, which\r\nfeed and reproduce, which assimilate and which bear a charm against\r\nthe assimilating power of the surrounding protoplasm. They would\r\nnecessarily be modified and displaced in the course of ontogeny, and\r\nwould therefore--no matter where they had been placed at first--be\r\nincapable of performing all that Delage ascribes to them. Either the\r\ngerm contains 'living' primary constituents, or it is, as Delage\r\nmaintains, determined chemico-physically; but in the latter case there\r\nis no scope for hereditary local variation. Delage must either renounce\r\nthe attempt to explain this, or he must transform his 'substances\r\nchimiques' into real and actually living determinants.\r\n\r\nThus from all sides we are forced to the conclusion that the\r\ngerm-substance on the whole owes its marvellous power of development\r\nnot only to its chemico-physical constitution, whether that be\r\neminently simple or marvellously complex, but to the fact that it\r\nconsists of many and different kinds of 'primary constituents'\r\n(_Anlagen_), that is, of groups of vital units equipped with the forces\r\nof life, and capable of interposing actively and in a specific manner,\r\nbut also capable of remaining latent in a passive state, until they\r\nare affected by a liberating stimulus, and on this account able to\r\ninterpose successively in development. The germ-cell cannot be merely\r\na simple organism, it must be a fabric made up of many different\r\norganisms or units, a microcosm.\r\n\r\nYet another train of thought leads us to the same idea, and this has\r\nits roots in the extraordinary complexity of the machine which we call\r\nthe organism.\r\n\r\nThe botanist Reinke has recently called attention once again to\r\nthe fact that machines cannot be directly made up of primary\r\nphysico-chemical forces or energies, but that, as Lotze said, forces of\r\na superior order are indispensable, which so dispose the fundamental\r\nchemico-physical forces that they must act in the way aimed at by\r\nthe purpose of the machine. To produce a watch it is not enough to\r\nbring together brass, steel, gold, and stones; to produce a piano it\r\nis not enough to lay wood, iron, leather, ivory, steel, &c., side by\r\nside, but these stuffs must be brought together in a definite form and\r\ncombination. In the same way, the mere juxtaposition of carbon and\r\nwater does not result in a carbohydrate like sugar or illuminating gas;\r\nthe component elements only yield what is desired when they are placed\r\nin a particular and absolutely definite relation to each other, in\r\nwhich they so act upon and with one another that sugar or illuminating\r\ngas results, and the same is true of the component elements of a watch\r\nor of a piano. In the watch and in the piano this relation is arranged\r\nby human intelligence, by the workmen who form the different materials\r\nand put them together in the proper manner. In this case, then, human\r\nintelligence is, as Reinke says, the 'superior force' which compels the\r\nenergies to work together in a particular way.\r\n\r\nBut organisms also are machines which perform a particular and\r\npurposeful kind of work, and they are only capable of doing so because\r\nthe energies which perform the work are forced into definite paths by\r\nsuperior forces; these superior forces are thus 'the steersmen of the\r\nenergies.' There is undoubtedly a kernel of truth in this view, and I\r\nshall return to it. Reinke, however, uses it in a way which I cannot\r\nfollow; that is, he infers from it a 'cosmic intelligence' which puts\r\nthese superior forces into the organisms, and thus controls these\r\nmachines to purposeful work, as the watchmaker puts 'superior forces'\r\ninto the watch by means of wheels, cylinders, and levers. In one case\r\nit is human intelligence which controls the 'superior forces,' in\r\nthe other 'cosmic' intelligence. I cannot regard this reasoning from\r\nanalogy as convincing, because, in the first place, these 'superior\r\nforces' are not 'forces' at all. They are constellations of energy,\r\nco-ordinations of matter and the energies immanent therein under\r\ncomplex and precisely defined conditions, and it is a matter of\r\nindifference whether chance or human intelligence has brought them\r\ntogether. If we take Reinke's own example of carbohydrates it is\r\ncertain that our coal-gas is due to the intelligence of man, which\r\nbrings together the carbon and the water in such a way that coal-gas\r\nmust arise. The 'superior forces' must here be looked for in the\r\narrangements of the coke-stove, and, in the second place, in the\r\nintelligence of man. But when decaying plants in the marsh form another\r\ncarbon-compound, marsh-gas, where do the directing 'superior forces'\r\ncome in? Surely only in the fortuitous concomitance of the necessary\r\nmaterials and the necessary conditions. Or may 'cosmic' intelligence\r\nhave established this laboratory in the marsh? If not, what can compel\r\nus to refer the formation of dextrin or starch in the cells of the\r\ngreen leaves of plants to 'superior forces' which are placed in them by\r\n'cosmic' intelligence? I am far from believing that the great and deep\r\nproblem here touched upon can be put aside in any off-hand manner, but\r\nI feel sure that it will never be solved by word-play about energies\r\nand 'superior forces.'\r\n\r\nLet us return to the kernel of truth in Reinke's thesis; it lies in\r\nthis, that, while the working of a machine does really depend on\r\nthe forces or energies which are bound up with the stuffs of which\r\nit consists, it also depends on a particular combination of these\r\nstuffs and forces, on a particular 'constellation' of them, as Fechner\r\nexpressed it. In the watch these 'constellations' are the springs,\r\nthe wheels, &c., and their position in relation to each other; but in\r\nthe organism they are the organs, down to the cells and cell-parts;\r\nfor the cell too is a machine, indeed a very complex one, as its\r\nfunctions prove. There are thousands of kinds of 'constellations' of\r\nelementary substances and forces which condition the activity of the\r\nliving machine, and only when all these constellations are present in\r\nthe proper manner and in the proper relations to each other can the\r\nfunctions of the organism be properly discharged.\r\n\r\nBut the living machine differs essentially from other machines in\r\nthe fact that it constructs itself; it arises by development from a\r\ncell, by going through numerous 'stages of development.' But none\r\nof these stages is a dead thing, each is itself a living organism\r\nwhose chief function is to give rise to the next stage. Thus each\r\nstage of the development may be compared to a machine whose function\r\nconsists in producing a similar but more complex machine. Each stage\r\nis thus composed, just like the complete organism, of a number of such\r\n'constellations' of elementary substances and elementary forces, whose\r\nnumber in the beginning is relatively small, but increases rapidly with\r\neach new stage.\r\n\r\nBut whence come these 'constellations' or, to keep to our metaphor,\r\nthe levers, wheels, and cranks of each successive stage in the making\r\nof the organic machine? The epigenetic theory of a germ-plasm without\r\nprimary constituents answers by pointing to internal and external\r\ninfluences which cause the germ-plasm, originally homogeneous, to\r\ndifferentiate gradually more and more, bringing it into the most\r\ndiverse 'constellations.' But how can such influences introduce new\r\nsprings, levers, and wheels of a quite specific kind, as must be the\r\ncase if apparently similar germinal substances are to give rise to two\r\nsuch different animals as a domestic duck and a teal? The cause must\r\nlie in the invisible differences in the protoplasm, opponents will\r\nanswer, and we with them. But our studies up to this point have shown\r\nus that the differences cannot be merely elementary differences, cannot\r\nbe merely of a physico-chemical nature depending on the composition of\r\nthe raw material and the implicated energies; they must depend on the\r\ndefinite co-ordination of substances and energies, in other words, on\r\nthe occurrence of 'constellations' of these. Thus the germ-plasm must\r\nbe composed of definite and very diverse combinations of living units,\r\nwhich are themselves bound up in a higher 'constellation,' so that they\r\nact as a living machine at the first stage of development, and liberate\r\ninto activity the already existing constellations of the second\r\nstage. The second stage in the series of living machines which arise\r\nsuccessively from each other liberates the sleeping 'constellations'\r\nfor the third, and so on.\r\n\r\nThese 'constellations' of matter and energy are the biophors, the\r\ndeterminants, and the 'groups of determinants' which we may think\r\nof as disposed in a manifold overlapping series. That they do not\r\nenter into activity all at once, but successively take their part in\r\ndevelopment, seems to me a necessary consequence of their successive\r\norigin in the phylogeny; and the ontogeny, as we shall see later,\r\narises through a modified condensation of the phylogeny. Now since\r\nevery new determinant that arises in the course of phylogeny can only\r\ndevelop by division and subsequent variation from the determinants\r\nwhich were previously active at the same place in the organism, it is\r\nquite intelligible that later on, when the phylogeny has been condensed\r\nin the ontogeny, they should not enter upon their active stage at\r\nthe same time as their phyletic predecessors, but after them. The\r\ntheory of Oscar Hertwig, who starts from a germ-plasm without primary\r\nconstituents, that all parts of the germ-plasm become active at the\r\nsame time, seems to me quite untenable. How could the wheels, levers,\r\nand springs of the complete vital machine, which arose so very slowly\r\nin the course of phylogeny, arise to-day in the ontogeny in such rapid\r\nsuccession unless they were already present in the germ-plasm and only\r\nrequired to be incited to activity, that is, liberated by the stage\r\npreceding them? Even Fechner supported this view when he supposed that\r\nthe interaction and mutual influences of the parts in the organism,\r\nthat is, of the 'constellations,' gave rise of themselves to the\r\nsucceeding stage, that is to say, to the new constellations peculiar\r\nto the succeeding stage. To this Reinke reasonably objected that it\r\nwas like expecting the window frames of a house in process of building\r\nto produce the panes of glass. The panes in the organism only develop\r\nin the window frames if their determinants have been present in the\r\ngerm-plasm from the beginning, and are liberated by the development of\r\nthe frames, just as the activity of the glazier is liberated by the\r\nsight of the completed frames. Neither new panes nor new determinants\r\ncould be produced rapidly; the former must be manufactured in the\r\nglass factory, the latter in the developmental workshop of the form\r\nof life in question, which workshop we call its phylogeny. But just\r\nas it is unnecessary to erect a new glass factory for each new house\r\nthat is built, so the development of each individual does not require\r\nthe establishment each time of those numberless life-factories--the\r\nconstellations--whose business it is to produce anew the wheels,\r\nlevers, springs, and cylinders of the developmental machinery at each\r\nstage, for they are all provided for in the germ-plasm, and it is only\r\non this account that they are capable of hereditary variation.\r\n\r\nI have already directed attention to some embryological facts which\r\nseem to be contradictory, if not to the germ-plasm theory itself, at\r\nleast to the assumption it makes that the germ-plasm is analysed out\r\nduring the ontogeny; and something more must be said on this head.\r\nI refer to the numerous facts brought to light through the science\r\nof developmental mechanics founded by Wilhelm Roux, and particularly\r\nto the investigations as to the prospective significance of the\r\nsegmentation-cells of the animal ovum.\r\n\r\nAmong these investigations we find experiments in compressing\r\ncertain eggs (sea-urchin's) in the early stages of segmentation.\r\nThe blastomeres are prevented by artificial pressure from grouping\r\nthemselves in the normal manner; they are compelled to spread out side\r\nby side in the _same plane_. If the pressure is removed, they change\r\ntheir grouping, and yield a normal embryo. I will not here discuss\r\nwhether these results can only be interpreted as showing that each\r\nsegmentation-cell has the same prospective significance, and that it\r\nis only its relative position which decides what part of the embryo is\r\nto be formed from it; this could not be done without going into great\r\ndetail; I therefore assume it to be true, and confine my survey to the\r\nsecond group of experiments, those on isolated segmentation-cells.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that in the eggs of the most diverse animals,\r\nfor instance in the sea-urchin once more, each of the two first\r\nblastomeres, if separated from one another, can develop into a complete\r\nlarva. Indeed, in the eggs of sea-urchin and some other animals each\r\nof the first four, or any of the first eight, blastomeres, and indeed\r\nany segmentation-cell during the earlier stages, possesses the power\r\nof developing to a certain point, namely, as far as the so-called\r\n'blastula-larva.' This seems to contradict a theory which assumes that\r\nthe primary constituents become separated in the successive stages of\r\nontogeny. But in the first place the blastomeres of all animals do\r\nnot behave in this way, and, moreover, the facts can be quite well\r\nexplained without entirely renouncing the assumption of the segregation\r\nof the determinant-complexes. It is only necessary to assume that the\r\nsegmentation-cells, which develop in the isolated condition as if they\r\nwere intact eggs, still contain the complete germ-plasm, and that the\r\ndifferential segregation into groups of determinants with dissimilar\r\nhereditary tendencies takes place later. This would certainly load\r\nthe theory with further complications, and I shall not enter into the\r\nquestion here, since the facts which we should have to consider are as\r\nyet by no means undisputed.\r\n\r\nBut in any case the facts of developmental mechanics referred to, which\r\nwe owe to numerous excellent observers of the last decade,--I need only\r\nname W. Roux, O. Hertwig, Chun, Driesch, Barfurth, Morgan, Conklin,\r\nWilson, Crampton, and Fischel--not only leave the essential part of the\r\ngerm-plasm theory untouched, but rather strengthen than endanger its\r\nmore subordinate points, such as the assumption of a segregation of the\r\ncomponents of the germ-plasm in the course of ontogenesis.\r\n\r\nAs to the fundamental ideas expressed in the theory, I have already\r\nshown that these remain unaltered, even if we do not assume a\r\ndisintegration or segregation of the germ-plasm, but think of all the\r\ndeveloping cells as equipped with the complete germ-plasm. In that case\r\nthe determinants would be liberated to activity solely by specific\r\nstimuli. But in regard to the assumption of disintegration, it must be\r\nnoted that the facts cited relative to the sea-urchin's ova do not by\r\nany means hold true of the eggs of all animals.\r\n\r\nIn various animal types each of the first two segmentation-cells,\r\nwhen separated from its neighbour, produces only a half-embryo, and\r\nany one of the first four cells a quarter-embryo. This 'fractional\r\nembryo' is, however, in some cases able later to develop into a whole\r\nembryo (to 'postgenerate' itself, as W. Roux says). The isolated\r\nblastomere shows, to begin with, an activity of only a half of the\r\nprimary constituents of the animal, as was first established by W. Roux\r\nand maintained conclusively, in spite of many attacks, until it was\r\nestablished beyond doubt by the detailed corroboratory investigations\r\nof Endres. The secondary completion of the embryo, which, however, is\r\nstill disputed, must be regarded as a regeneration, and, to explain it,\r\na co-operation of the complete but not yet wholly active germ-plasm in\r\nboth segmentation-cells must therefore be assumed.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us too far if I were to deal in detail even with the\r\nmost important of the numerous facts that the last decade has brought\r\nto light; I shall restrict myself to the most essential.\r\n\r\nThat isolated segmentation-cells have the capacity of developing into\r\nembryos which are complete but correspondingly smaller in size has been\r\ndemonstrated in animals of various groups, though it does not seem to\r\ngo to the same length in all. In the Medusæ we find that not only one\r\nof the first two, but one of the first four, eight, and even sixteen\r\nsegmentation-cells may develop a whole larva when isolated (Zoja). In\r\nthe sea-urchin at least any one of the first eight blastomeres may do\r\nso. And Driesch's experiments in cutting up the young larvæ at the\r\nblastula-stage (a single-layered ball of cells) leads us to assume that\r\neach of these cells still possesses the complete germ-plasm. Beyond\r\nthat stage, however, the primary constituents obviously divide into\r\nthose of the ectoderm and those of the endoderm, for the subsequent\r\ntwo-layered stage in the sea-urchin's development, the gastrula, does\r\nnot complete itself if it be artificially divided into fragments which\r\nconsist only of cells from the outer, or only of cells from the inner\r\nlayer. In corroboration of this experiment made by Barfurth, Samassa\r\nwas able to demonstrate in regard to the egg of the frog that, even\r\nafter the third division of the ovum, the segmentation-cells are so\r\ndifferent from each other in respect of their primary constituents\r\nthat they were not able to replace each other mutually. When this\r\ninvestigator killed the ectoderm-cells alone by means of an induction\r\ncurrent, or the endoderm-cells alone, the dead half could not be\r\nreplaced by the half which remained alive, and the whole ovum perished.\r\n\r\nIf these facts may be adduced in favour of a separation of the primary\r\nconstituents at an earlier or later stage, we find even stronger proofs\r\namong the Ctenophores, Gastropods, Bivalves, and Annelids. In the\r\nlast-named group Wilson has shown it to be probable that development\r\nis really a 'mosaic work,' as Roux and I had assumed. The older\r\nobservations made by Chun at an earlier date on the Ctenophora, and\r\nthe more recent experiments of Fischel on the same animals, prove the\r\nsame thing for this group. In this case complete larvæ are easily\r\ndistinguished from mere 'partial developments' by the number of the\r\ncharacteristic 'ciliated meridional rows' or ribs, which extend from\r\none pole of the larva to another. In the complete larva there are\r\neight of these, but in larvæ from one of the first two blastomeres\r\n(isolated) there are only four, and in those which have arisen from one\r\nof the first four blastomeres there are only two. If an ovum at the\r\neight-cell stage can be successfully divided into separate blastomeres,\r\neach of these will form an 'eighth larva,' always with only one\r\nciliated rib. Even in the succeeding sixteen-cell stage it could still\r\nbe demonstrated that the substance responsible for the formation of\r\nthe ribs only lies in particular places and always suffices only for\r\neight ribs. The sixteen-cell stage consists of eight large cells and\r\neight small ones, the 'macromeres' and the 'micromeres'; if an ovum\r\nat this stage be cut so that one piece contains five macromeres and\r\nfive micromeres, a partial larva will develop which possesses only\r\nfive ribs, while the larva from the other portion will have only\r\nthree. But the localizing of the rib-determinants can be followed\r\nstill further, for in larvæ in which individual micromeres have\r\nbeen displaced from their normal position there is a correlated\r\ndisplacement of the corresponding ribs, and a dislocation of their\r\nciliated comb-plates. The determinants of the ribs must therefore\r\nlie in the micromeres, and we must conclude that at the antecedent\r\ndivision they were only imparted to one daughter-nucleus, while the\r\nother, that of the macromere, did not receive this kind of determinant.\r\nHere then we have an example of dissimilar or differential division.\r\nThose who oppose this theory of qualitative division will hardly be\r\nlikely to admit this, but will rather seek to maintain that 'external\r\ninfluences,' such as relative position, determine which cells are to\r\ngive rise to the ciliated ribs and which are not. But the fact that\r\nartificial displacement of the micromeres leads to a disarrangement of\r\nthe ciliated comb-plates, of which the ribs are made up, invalidates\r\nthis suggestion, and at the same time overthrows the interpretation\r\nthat it may be the cells which lie on particular meridians that are\r\ndetermined by this position to the production of ciliated plates.\r\nObviously, the converse of this is true; those cells which contain\r\nthe rib-determinants come to lie in the regular course of development\r\nin these eight meridians, and the cells lying between them, though of\r\nthe same descent (from micromeres), contain no such determinants and\r\ntherefore form no ribs. But if those cells which are equipped with\r\nrib-determinants be artificially displaced, then they give rise to\r\nswimming-plates elsewhere than on the aforesaid meridians.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made by Crampton on a marine Gastropod, _Ilyanassa_,\r\nlikewise go to prove that a disintegration or segregation of the\r\nprimary constituents does occur in the course of development. In\r\nthis case, when the first two or first four segmentation-cells were\r\nartificially separated from each other, they developed exactly as\r\nif they still belonged to the complete ovum, that is, each isolated\r\nsegmentation-cell yielded, respectively, a half or a quarter-embryo.\r\nAnd these 'partial embryos' were not able in this case to give rise\r\nsubsequently to the missing parts or to form complete embryos.\r\n\r\nThere are thus two contrasted groups of animals, in one of which a\r\nsegregation of the mass of primary constituents apparently takes place\r\nat the very beginning, while in the other it does not take place in the\r\nfirst stages of development, but apparently occurs later on. We may\r\ndistinguish these two groups, with Heider, as those having 'regulation\r\nova' and those having 'mosaic ova.' But I do not see that this affords\r\nany reason why we should give up our conception of the successive\r\nsegregation of the germ-plasm into its determinants, even although, as\r\nI said before, I may modify it so far as to say that the segregation\r\ndoes not necessarily take place in all groups and species of animals at\r\nthe same time, but occurs earlier in some and later in others.\r\n\r\nNow that I have shown how the germ-plasm theory may be brought into\r\nharmony with the phenomena of ontogeny, I wish to go on to show what\r\nthe theory can accomplish in clarifying our understanding of the\r\nphenomena of reproduction and heredity. I shall at the same time give a\r\nbrief exposition of some of the most important of these phenomena.\r\n\r\nFirst, a few words in regard to the development of the reproductive\r\ncells. We may leave aside in the meantime the question whether they\r\nare sexually differentiated or not; we are only concerned just now\r\nwith the main problem: How is it possible for the organism to produce\r\ngerm-cells, that is, cells which contain the complete germ-plasm with\r\nall its determinants, when the building up of the body in ontogeny,\r\naccording to our theory, involves a disintegration or segregation of\r\nthe determinant-architecture into smaller and smaller groups? It is\r\nimpossible that specific determinants should arise _de novo_, just\r\nas an animal cannot arise otherwise than from its germ, nor a cell\r\notherwise than from a cell, nor a nucleus otherwise than from an\r\nalready existing nucleus. If vital units ever originate _de novo_\r\nat all, it is only conceivable in the case of the very simplest\r\nbiophors, as we shall see later when we come to speak of 'Spontaneous\r\nGeneration.' Specific biophors and the determinants composed of them\r\nhave behind them a phylogeny, a history, which conditions that they\r\nshall arise only from their like.\r\n\r\nThus we see that germ-cells can only arise where all the determinants\r\nof the relevant species arranged as ids are already present. If we\r\ncould assume that the ovum, just beginning to develop, divides at\r\nits first cleavage into two cells, one of which gives rise to the\r\nwhole body (soma) and the other only to the germ-cells lying in this\r\nbody, the matter would be theoretically simple. We should say, the\r\ngerm-plasm of the ovum first doubles itself by growth, as the nuclear\r\nsubstance does at every nuclear division, and then divides into two\r\nsimilar halves, one of which, lying in the primordial somatic cell,\r\nbecomes at once active and breaks up into smaller and smaller groups\r\nof determinants corresponding to the building up of the body, while\r\nthe germ-plasm in the other remains in a more or less 'bound' or 'set'\r\ncondition, and is only active to the extent of gradually stamping as\r\ngerm-cells the cells which arise from the primordial germ-cell.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, only one group of animals is known to behave\r\ndemonstrably in this manner, the Diptera among insects; in all others\r\nthe cell from which the germ-cells exclusively arise, the 'primordial\r\ngerm-cell,' makes its appearance later in development, usually\r\nduring embryogenesis and often very early in it, after the first few\r\ndivisions of the ovum, but sometimes not till long after the end of\r\nembryogenesis, and not even in the individual which arises from the\r\novum, but in descendants which arise from it by budding. This last\r\ncase occurs especially in the colonial hydroid polyps, which multiply\r\nby budding. Here the primordial germ-cell is separated from the ovum\r\nby a long series of cell-generations, and the sole possibility of\r\nexplaining the presence of germ-plasm in this primordial cell is to\r\nbe found in the assumption that in the divisions of the ovum the\r\nwhole of the germ-plasm originally contained in it was not broken up\r\ninto determinant groups, but that a part, perhaps the greater part,\r\nwas handed on in a latent state from cell to cell, till sooner or\r\nlater it reached a cell which it stamped as the primordial germ-cell.\r\nTheoretically it makes no difference whether these 'germ-tracks,' that\r\nis, the cell-generations which lead from the ovum to the primordial\r\ngerm-cell, are short or very long, whether they consist of three or\r\nsix or sixteen cells, or of hundreds and thousands of cells. That\r\nall the cells of the germ-track do not take on the character of\r\ngerm-cells must, in accordance with our conception of the 'maturing'\r\nof determinants, be referred to the internal conditions of the cells\r\nand of the germ-plasm, perhaps in part also to an associated quantum\r\nof somatic idioplasm which is only overpowered in the course of the\r\ncell-divisions.\r\n\r\nThis splitting up of the substance of the ovum into a somatic half,\r\nwhich directs the development of the individual, and a propagative\r\nhalf, which reaches the germ-cells and there remains inactive, and\r\nlater gives rise to the succeeding generation, constitutes _the theory\r\nof the continuity of the germ-plasm_, which I first stated in a work\r\nwhich appeared in the year 1885. Its fundamental idea had already been\r\nexpressed much earlier by Francis Galton (1872), without however being\r\nfully appreciated at the time or having any influence on the course\r\nof science, and the same is true with the later theoretical views of\r\nJäger, Rauber, and Nussbaum, all of whom reached the same idea quite\r\nindependently of each other, and sought to elaborate it more or less\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis does not depend for support merely on a recognition of\r\nits theoretical necessity; on the contrary, there is a whole series of\r\nfacts which may be adduced as strongly in its favour.\r\n\r\nThus, even the familiar fact that the excision of the reproductive\r\norgans in all animals produces sterility proves that no other cells\r\nof the body are able to give rise to germ-cells; germ-plasm cannot be\r\nproduced _de novo_. An unmistakable corroboration of this, it seems\r\nto me, is to be found in the conditions of germ-cell formation in\r\nthe medusoids and hydroid polyps, for here it is apparent that the\r\nbirthplace of the germs, that is, the place at which the germ-cells\r\nof the animal are formed, has been shifted backwards in the course\r\nof phylogenetic evolution, that is, has been moved nearer to the\r\nstarting-point of development. This shifting has exactly followed\r\nthe 'germ-tracks.' as we shall see, although in some cases it would\r\nhave been more advantageous if the birthplace of the germ-cells could\r\nhave lain outside of these. Obviously, then, it is only the existing\r\ncell-generations of the germ-track which were able to give rise to\r\ngerm-cells, or, in other words, they alone contained the indispensable\r\ngerm-plasm. With the help of Figs. 94 and 95 I hope to be able to make\r\nthis matter clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94. Diagram to illustrate the phylogenetic shifting\r\nback of the origins of the germ-cells in medusoids and hydroids. A\r\ncomposite picture. _A_, branch of a polyp colony. _P_, polyp-head with\r\nmouth (_m_) and tentacles. _St_, stalk of the polyp. _M_, medusoid-bud\r\nwith the bell (_Gl_). _T_, marginal tentacle. _m_, mouth. _Mst_,\r\nmanubrium. _GphK_, a gonophore-bud. _GH_, gastric cavity. _ekt_,\r\nectoderm. _ent_, endoderm. _st_, supporting lamella. The germ-cells\r\n(_kz_) arise in the medusoid in the ectoderm of the manubrium--first\r\nphyletic stage--where they also attain maturity. In the gonophore-bud\r\n(_GphK_) they arise in the ectoderm (_kz´_), or further down in the\r\nstalk of the polyp at _kz´´_--third phyletic stage, or in the ectoderm\r\nof the branch from which the polyp has arisen, at _kz´´´_--fourth\r\nphyletic stage of the shunting of the originative area of the\r\ngerm-cells. In the two last cases the germ-cells migrate until they\r\nreach their primitive place of origination in the medusoid, or in the\r\ncorresponding layer of the medusoid gonophore, as may be more clearly\r\nseen in Fig. 95. Drawn from my sketch by Dr. Petrunkewitsch.]\r\n\r\nIn the hydroid polyps and their medusoids the germ-cells always\r\narise in the ectoderm; in species which produce sexual medusoids by\r\nbudding, the germ-cells arise in the ectoderm of the manubrium of these\r\nmedusoids (Fig. 94, _M_, _kz_). But in many species these sexual stages\r\nhave degenerated in the course of phylogeny into so-called gonophores,\r\nthat is, to medusoids which still exhibit more or less complete bells,\r\nbut neither mouth (_m_) nor marginal tentacles (_T_), and which no\r\nlonger break away from the colony to swim freely about, to feed\r\nindependently, and to produce and ripen germ-cells. The degeneration\r\nof the 'gonophores' often goes even further; in many the medusoid bell\r\nis represented only by a thin layer of cells, and in some even this\r\ntoken of descent from medusoid ancestry is absent, and they are mere\r\nsingle-layered closed brood-sacs (Fig. 95, _Gph_).\r\n\r\nThe adherence of the sexual animal to the hydroid colony has,\r\nhowever, made a more rapid ripening of the germ-cells possible, and\r\nnature has taken advantage of this possibility in all the cases\r\nknown to me, for the germ-cells no longer arise in the manubrium\r\nof the mature degenerate medusoid, that is, of the gonophore, but\r\n_earlier_, before the bud which becomes a gonophore possesses a\r\nmanubrium. The birthplace of the germ-cells is thus shifted back from\r\nthe manubrium of the medusoid to the young gonophore-bud (Fig. 94,\r\n_M_, _kz_). The same thing occurs in species in which the medusoids\r\nare liberated, but live only for a short time, for instance, in the\r\ngenus _Podocoryne_. Although perfect medusoids are formed, these have\r\ntheir germ-cells fully developed at the time of their liberation from\r\nthe hydroid colony. But in species in which the medusoid-buds have\r\nreally degenerated and are no longer liberated, the birthplace of the\r\ngerm-cells is shifted _even further back_, and in the first place into\r\nthe stalk (_St_, _kz´´_) of the polyp from the gonophore-buds. This\r\nis the case in the genus _Hydractinia_. In the further course of the\r\nprocess the birthplace of the germ-cells has shifted as far back as to\r\nthe branch from which the polyp has grown out (Fig. 94, _A_, _kz´´´_);\r\nand finally, in the cases in which the medusoid has degenerated to\r\na mere brood-sac (Fig. 95, _Gph_), even to the generation of polyps\r\nimmediately before, that is, into the polyp-stem from which the branch\r\narises that bears the polyps producing the gonophore-bud (Fig. 95,\r\n_kz´´´_). Then we find the birthplace of the germ-cells _still_ further\r\nback (Fig. 95, _kz´´´´_), for the egg and sperm-cells arise in the stem\r\nof the principal polyps (the main stem of the colony). The advantage of\r\nthis arrangement is easily seen, for the principal polyp is present\r\nearlier than those of the secondary branches, and these again earlier\r\nthan the polyp which bears the sexual buds, and this, finally, earlier\r\nthan the sexual bud which it bears. Thus this shunting backwards of the\r\nbirthplace of the germ-cells means an earlier origin of the primordium\r\n(_Anlage_) of the germ-cells, and consequently an earlier maturing of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95. Diagram to illustrate the migration of the\r\ngerm-cells in hydro-medusæ from their remotely shunted place of origin\r\nto their primitive place of origin in the gonophore, in which they\r\nattain to maturity.

The originative area of the germ-cells\r\nlies in the stem of the principal polyp at _kz´´´´_, whence the\r\ngerm-cells first migrate into the endoderm of the branch (_A_) at\r\n_kz´´´_, creeping within which they reach _kz´´_ in the lateral polyp\r\n(blastostyle), finally reaching the gonophore (_kz_) and passing again\r\ninto the ectoderm. Drawn from my sketch by Dr. Petrunkewitsch.]\r\n\r\nBut none of all these germ-cells come to maturity in the birthplace to\r\nwhich they have been shifted, for they migrate independently from it to\r\nthe place at which they primitively arose, namely, into the manubrium\r\nof the medusoid, which is still present even when great degeneration\r\nhas occurred, or even--in the most extreme cases of degeneration--into\r\nthe ectoderm of the brood-sac. This is the case in the genus\r\n_Eudendrium_, of which Fig. 95 gives a diagrammatic representation.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of this migration of the germ-cells is\r\nthat the cells invariably arise in the ectoderm (_kz´´´´_), then pierce\r\nthrough the supporting lamella (_st_) into the endoderm (_kz´´´_), and\r\nthen creep along it to their maturing-place. Once there they break\r\nthrough again to the outer layer of cells, the ectoderm (_kz_), and\r\ncome to maturity (_Ei_). That they make their way through the endoderm\r\nis probably to be explained by the fact that they are there in direct\r\nproximity to the food-stream which flows through the colony (_GH_ =\r\ngastric cavity), and they are thus more richly nourished there than\r\nin the ectoderm. But although this is the case, they never arise in\r\nthe endoderm; in no single case is the birthplace of the germ-cells to\r\nbe found in the endoderm, but always in the ectoderm, no matter how\r\nfar back it may have been shunted. Even when the germ-cells migrate\r\nthrough the endoderm, their first recognizable appearance is invariably\r\nin the ectoderm, as, for instance, in _Podocoryne_ and _Hydractinia_.\r\nThe course of affairs is thus exactly what it would necessarily be if\r\nour supposition were correct, that only definite cell-generations--in\r\nthis case the ectoderm-cells--contain the complete germ-plasm. If the\r\nendoderm-cells also contained germ-plasm it would be hard to understand\r\nwhy the germ-cells never arise from them, since their situation offers\r\nmuch better conditions for their further development than that of\r\nthe ectoderm-cells. It would also be hard to understand why such a\r\ncircuitous route was chosen as that exhibited by the migration of\r\nthe young germ-cells into the endoderm. Something must be lacking in\r\nthe endoderm that is necessary to make a cell into a germ-cell: that\r\nsomething is the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the theory of the continuity of the germ-plasm as in the\r\nmain correct, it appears that higher animals and plants are constructed\r\nof two kinds of elements, the somatic cells and the germ-cells; both\r\nowe their being to the germ-plasm of the ovum, but the former do not\r\ncontain it complete but only in individual determinants[24], and\r\ntherefore can never give rise again to the rank of germ-cells; the\r\nothers contain the latent germ-plasm intact, and can therefore produce\r\nnot only cells like themselves for a certain time by division, but\r\nhave also the power, when they are mature and the necessary conditions\r\nhave been fulfilled, of bringing forth a new individual of the same\r\nspecies. The former have only a limited length of life, they die--they\r\nmust necessarily die--when the life of the individual to which they\r\nbelong is at an end; the latter are potentially immortal, like the\r\nunicellular organisms, that is, they can in favourable circumstances\r\ngive rise to the germ-cells of a new individual, and so on for all\r\ntime, as far as we can see. The germ-plasm of a species is thus never\r\nformed _de novo_, but it grows and increases ceaselessly; it is handed\r\non from one generation to another like a long root creeping through\r\nthe earth, from which at regular distances shoots grow up and become\r\nplants, the individuals of the successive generations. If these\r\nconditions be considered from the point of view of reproduction, the\r\ngerm-cells appear the most important part of the individual, for they\r\nalone maintain the species, and the body sinks down almost to the\r\nlevel of a mere cradle for the germ-cells, a place in which they are\r\nformed, and under favourable conditions are nourished, multiply, and\r\nattain to maturity. But the matter can also be looked at in an opposite\r\nlight, and then the endless root of the germ-plasm, with its germ-cells\r\never forming new individuals, may be regarded as the means by which\r\nalone nature was able to create multicellular organisms, individuals\r\nof higher and higher differentiation and capacity, able to adapt\r\nthemselves to all possible conditions, and to make the fullest use of\r\nall the possibilities of life.\r\n\r\n[24] Boveri has recently made an observation upon the thread-worm of\r\nthe horse, which points to the correctness of the conception of the\r\ngerm-plasm. The two first segmentation-cells both receive the four\r\nchromosomes of the species, but, in one of the two, a portion of the\r\nchromatin breaks off and degenerates, or dissolves, at least as far\r\nas can be seen. The other cell retains the whole mass of chromatin,\r\nand from this there arise later the primitive genital-cells. In the\r\ngerm-track, therefore--so we must interpret it--the whole of the\r\ngerm-plasm is retained, while a part of it is withdrawn from the soma.\r\nI have only partly described the process, and I do not wish to enter in\r\ndetail on an interpretation of it, since it seems to me obscure and to\r\nrequire further observations before an interpretation can be attempted\r\nwith any confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.
