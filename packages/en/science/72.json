Her shapely, sandalled foot tapped\r\nimpatiently upon the jewel-strewn walk that wound beneath the stately\r\nsorapus trees across the scarlet sward of the royal gardens of Thuvan\r\nDihn, Jeddak of Ptarth, as a dark-haired, red-skinned warrior bent low\r\ntoward her, whispering heated words close to her ear.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Thuvia of Ptarth,” he cried, “you are cold even before the fiery\r\nblasts of my consuming love! No harder than your heart, nor colder is\r\nthe hard, cold ersite of this thrice happy bench which supports your\r\ndivine and fadeless form! Tell me, O Thuvia of Ptarth, that I may still\r\nhope—that though you do not love me now, yet some day, some day, my\r\nprincess, I—”\r\n\r\nThe girl sprang to her feet with an exclamation of surprise and\r\ndispleasure. Her queenly head was poised haughtily upon her smooth red\r\nshoulders. Her dark eyes looked angrily into those of the man.\r\n\r\n“You forget yourself, and the customs of Barsoom, Astok,” she said. “I\r\nhave given you no right thus to address the daughter of Thuvan Dihn,\r\nnor have you won such a right.”\r\n\r\nThe man reached suddenly forth and grasped her by the arm.\r\n\r\n“You shall be my princess!” he cried. “By the breast of Issus, thou\r\nshalt, nor shall any other come between Astok, Prince of Dusar, and his\r\nheart’s desire. Tell me that there is another, and I shall cut out his\r\nfoul heart and fling it to the wild calots of the dead sea-bottoms!”\r\n\r\nAt touch of the man’s hand upon her flesh the girl went pallid beneath\r\nher coppery skin, for the persons of the royal women of the courts of\r\nMars are held but little less than sacred. The act of Astok, Prince of\r\nDusar, was profanation. There was no terror in the eyes of Thuvia of\r\nPtarth—only horror for the thing the man had done and for its possible\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n“Release me.” Her voice was level—frigid.\r\n\r\nThe man muttered incoherently and drew her roughly toward him.\r\n\r\n“Release me!” she repeated sharply, “or I call the guard, and the\r\nPrince of Dusar knows what that will mean.”\r\n\r\nQuickly he threw his right arm about her shoulders and strove to draw\r\nher face to his lips. With a little cry she struck him full in the\r\nmouth with the massive bracelets that circled her free arm.\r\n\r\n“Calot!” she exclaimed, and then: “The guard! The guard! Hasten in\r\nprotection of the Princess of Ptarth!”\r\n\r\nIn answer to her call a dozen guardsmen came racing across the scarlet\r\nsward, their gleaming long-swords naked in the sun, the metal of their\r\naccoutrements clanking against that of their leathern harness, and in\r\ntheir throats hoarse shouts of rage at the sight which met their eyes.\r\n\r\nBut before they had passed half across the royal garden to where Astok\r\nof Dusar still held the struggling girl in his grasp, another figure\r\nsprang from a cluster of dense foliage that half hid a golden fountain\r\nclose at hand. A tall, straight youth he was, with black hair and keen\r\ngrey eyes; broad of shoulder and narrow of hip; a clean-limbed fighting\r\nman. His skin was but faintly tinged with the copper colour that marks\r\nthe red men of Mars from the other races of the dying planet—he was\r\nlike them, and yet there was a subtle difference greater even than that\r\nwhich lay in his lighter skin and his grey eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was a difference, too, in his movements. He came on in great\r\nleaps that carried him so swiftly over the ground that the speed of the\r\nguardsmen was as nothing by comparison.\r\n\r\nAstok still clutched Thuvia’s wrist as the young warrior confronted\r\nhim. The new-comer wasted no time and he spoke but a single word.\r\n\r\n“Calot!” he snapped, and then his clenched fist landed beneath the\r\nother’s chin, lifting him high into the air and depositing him in a\r\ncrumpled heap within the centre of the pimalia bush beside the ersite\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nHer champion turned toward the girl. “Kaor, Thuvia of Ptarth!” he\r\ncried. “It seems that fate timed my visit well.”\r\n\r\n“Kaor, Carthoris of Helium!” the princess returned the young man’s\r\ngreeting, “and what less could one expect of the son of such a sire?”\r\n\r\nHe bowed his acknowledgment of the compliment to his father, John\r\nCarter, Warlord of Mars. And then the guardsmen, panting from their\r\ncharge, came up just as the Prince of Dusar, bleeding at the mouth, and\r\nwith drawn sword, crawled from the entanglement of the pimalia.\r\n\r\nAstok would have leaped to mortal combat with the son of Dejah Thoris,\r\nbut the guardsmen pressed about him, preventing, though it was clearly\r\nevident that naught would have better pleased Carthoris of Helium.\r\n\r\n“But say the word, Thuvia of Ptarth,” he begged, “and naught will give\r\nme greater pleasure than meting to this fellow the punishment he has\r\nearned.”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be, Carthoris,” she replied. “Even though he has forfeited\r\nall claim upon my consideration, yet is he the guest of the jeddak, my\r\nfather, and to him alone may he account for the unpardonable act he has\r\ncommitted.”\r\n\r\n“As you say, Thuvia,” replied the Heliumite. “But afterward he shall\r\naccount to Carthoris, Prince of Helium, for this affront to the\r\ndaughter of my father’s friend.” As he spoke, though, there burned in\r\nhis eyes a fire that proclaimed a nearer, dearer cause for his\r\nchampionship of this glorious daughter of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nThe maid’s cheek darkened beneath the satin of her transparent skin,\r\nand the eyes of Astok, Prince of Dusar, darkened, too, as he read that\r\nwhich passed unspoken between the two in the royal gardens of the\r\njeddak.\r\n\r\n“And thou to me,” he snapped at Carthoris, answering the young man’s\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nThe guard still surrounded Astok. It was a difficult position for the\r\nyoung officer who commanded it. His prisoner was the son of a mighty\r\njeddak; he was the guest of Thuvan Dihn—until but now an honoured guest\r\nupon whom every royal dignity had been showered. To arrest him forcibly\r\ncould mean naught else than war, and yet he had done that which in the\r\neyes of the Ptarth warrior merited death.\r\n\r\nThe young man hesitated. He looked toward his princess. She, too,\r\nguessed all that hung upon the action of the coming moment. For many\r\nyears Dusar and Ptarth had been at peace with each other. Their great\r\nmerchant ships plied back and forth between the larger cities of the\r\ntwo nations. Even now, far above the gold-shot scarlet dome of the\r\njeddak’s palace, she could see the huge bulk of a giant freighter\r\ntaking its majestic way through the thin Barsoomian air toward the west\r\nand Dusar.\r\n\r\nBy a word she might plunge these two mighty nations into a bloody\r\nconflict that would drain them of their bravest blood and their\r\nincalculable riches, leaving them all helpless against the inroads of\r\ntheir envious and less powerful neighbors, and at last a prey to the\r\nsavage green hordes of the dead sea-bottoms.\r\n\r\nNo sense of fear influenced her decision, for fear is seldom known to\r\nthe children of Mars. It was rather a sense of the responsibility that\r\nshe, the daughter of their jeddak, felt for the welfare of her father’s\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“I called you, Padwar,” she said to the lieutenant of the guard, “to\r\nprotect the person of your princess, and to keep the peace that must\r\nnot be violated within the royal gardens of the jeddak. That is all.\r\nYou will escort me to the palace, and the Prince of Helium will\r\naccompany me.”\r\n\r\nWithout another glance in the direction of Astok she turned, and taking\r\nCarthoris’ proffered hand, moved slowly toward the massive marble pile\r\nthat housed the ruler of Ptarth and his glittering court. On either\r\nside marched a file of guardsmen. Thus Thuvia of Ptarth found a way out\r\nof a dilemma, escaping the necessity of placing her father’s royal\r\nguest under forcible restraint, and at the same time separating the two\r\nprinces, who otherwise would have been at each other’s throat the\r\nmoment she and the guard had departed.\r\n\r\nBeside the pimalia stood Astok, his dark eyes narrowed to mere slits of\r\nhate beneath his lowering brows as he watched the retreating forms of\r\nthe woman who had aroused the fiercest passions of his nature and the\r\nman whom he now believed to be the one who stood between his love and\r\nits consummation.\r\n\r\nAs they disappeared within the structure Astok shrugged his shoulders,\r\nand with a murmured oath crossed the gardens toward another wing of the\r\nbuilding where he and his retinue were housed.\r\n\r\nThat night he took formal leave of Thuvan Dihn, and though no mention\r\nwas made of the happening within the garden, it was plain to see\r\nthrough the cold mask of the jeddak’s courtesy that only the customs of\r\nroyal hospitality restrained him from voicing the contempt he felt for\r\nthe Prince of Dusar.\r\n\r\nCarthoris was not present at the leave-taking, nor was Thuvia. The\r\nceremony was as stiff and formal as court etiquette could make it, and\r\nwhen the last of the Dusarians clambered over the rail of the\r\nbattleship that had brought them upon this fateful visit to the court\r\nof Ptarth, and the mighty engine of destruction had risen slowly from\r\nthe ways of the landing stage, a note of relief was apparent in the\r\nvoice of Thuvan Dihn as he turned to one of his officers with a word of\r\ncomment upon a subject foreign to that which had been uppermost in the\r\nminds of all for hours.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, was it so foreign?\r\n\r\n“Inform Prince Sovan,” he directed, “that it is our wish that the fleet\r\nwhich departed for Kaol this morning be recalled to cruise to the west\r\nof Ptarth.”\r\n\r\nAs the warship, bearing Astok back to the court of his father, turned\r\ntoward the west, Thuvia of Ptarth, sitting upon the same bench where\r\nthe Prince of Dusar had affronted her, watched the twinkling lights of\r\nthe craft growing smaller in the distance. Beside her, in the brilliant\r\nlight of the nearer moon, sat Carthoris. His eyes were not upon the dim\r\nbulk of the battleship, but on the profile of the girl’s upturned face.\r\n\r\n“Thuvia,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe girl turned her eyes toward his. His hand stole out to find hers,\r\nbut she drew her own gently away.\r\n\r\n“Thuvia of Ptarth, I love you!” cried the young warrior. “Tell me that\r\nit does not offend.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head sadly. “The love of Carthoris of Helium,” she said\r\nsimply, “could be naught but an honour to any woman; but you must not\r\nspeak, my friend, of bestowing upon me that which I may not\r\nreciprocate.”\r\n\r\nThe young man got slowly to his feet. His eyes were wide in\r\nastonishment. It never had occurred to the Prince of Helium that Thuvia\r\nof Ptarth might love another.\r\n\r\n“But at Kadabra!” he exclaimed. “And later here at your father’s court,\r\nwhat did you do, Thuvia of Ptarth, that might have warned me that you\r\ncould not return my love?”\r\n\r\n“And what did I do, Carthoris of Helium,” she returned, “that might\r\nlead you to believe that I _did_ return it?”\r\n\r\nHe paused in thought, and then shook his head. “Nothing, Thuvia, that\r\nis true; yet I could have sworn you loved me. Indeed, you well knew how\r\nnear to worship has been my love for you.”\r\n\r\n“And how might I know it, Carthoris?” she asked innocently. “Did you\r\never tell me as much? Ever before have words of love for me fallen from\r\nyour lips?”\r\n\r\n“But you _must_ have known it!” he exclaimed. “I am like my\r\nfather—witless in matters of the heart, and of a poor way with women;\r\nyet the jewels that strew these royal garden paths—the trees, the\r\nflowers, the sward—all must have read the love that has filled my heart\r\nsince first my eyes were made new by imaging your perfect face and\r\nform; so how could you alone have been blind to it?”\r\n\r\n“Do the maids of Helium pay court to their men?” asked Thuvia.\r\n\r\n“You are playing with me!” exclaimed Carthoris. “Say that you are but\r\nplaying, and that after all you love me, Thuvia!”\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you that, Carthoris, for I am promised to another.”\r\n\r\nHer tone was level, but was there not within it the hint of an infinite\r\ndepth of sadness? Who may say?\r\n\r\n“Promised to another?” Carthoris scarcely breathed the words. His face\r\nwent almost white, and then his head came up as befitted him in whose\r\nveins flowed the blood of the overlord of a world.\r\n\r\n“Carthoris of Helium wishes you every happiness with the man of your\r\nchoice,” he said. “With—” and then he hesitated, waiting for her to\r\nfill in the name.\r\n\r\n“Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol,” she replied. “My father’s friend and\r\nPtarth’s most puissant ally.”\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at her intently for a moment before he spoke\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“You love him, Thuvia of Ptarth?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I am promised to him,” she replied simply.\r\n\r\nHe did not press her. “He is of Barsoom’s noblest blood and mightiest\r\nfighters,” mused Carthoris. “My father’s friend and mine—would that it\r\nmight have been another!” he muttered almost savagely. What the girl\r\nthought was hidden by the mask of her expression, which was tinged only\r\nby a little shadow of sadness that might have been for Carthoris,\r\nherself, or for them both.\r\n\r\nCarthoris of Helium did not ask, though he noted it, for his loyalty to\r\nKulan Tith was the loyalty of the blood of John Carter of Virginia for\r\na friend, greater than which could be no loyalty.\r\n\r\nHe raised a jewel-encrusted bit of the girl’s magnificent trappings to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n“To the honour and happiness of Kulan Tith and the priceless jewel that\r\nhas been bestowed upon him,” he said, and though his voice was husky\r\nthere was the true ring of sincerity in it. “I told you that I loved\r\nyou, Thuvia, before I knew that you were promised to another. I may not\r\ntell you it again, but I am glad that you know it, for there is no\r\ndishonour in it either to you or to Kulan Tith or to myself. My love is\r\nsuch that it may embrace as well Kulan Tith—if you love him.” There was\r\nalmost a question in the statement.\r\n\r\n“I am promised to him,” she replied.\r\n\r\nCarthoris backed slowly away. He laid one hand upon his heart, the\r\nother upon the pommel of his long-sword.\r\n\r\n“These are yours—always,” he said. A moment later he had entered the\r\npalace, and was gone from the girl’s sight.\r\n\r\nHad he returned at once he would have found her prone upon the ersite\r\nbench, her face buried in her arms. Was she weeping? There was none to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nCarthoris of Helium had come all unannounced to the court of his\r\nfather’s friend that day. He had come alone in a small flier, sure of\r\nthe same welcome that always awaited him at Ptarth. As there had been\r\nno formality in his coming there was no need of formality in his going.\r\n\r\nTo Thuvan Dihn he explained that he had been but testing an invention\r\nof his own with which his flier was equipped—a clever improvement of\r\nthe ordinary Martian air compass, which, when set for a certain\r\ndestination, will remain constantly fixed thereon, making it only\r\nnecessary to keep a vessel’s prow always in the direction of the\r\ncompass needle to reach any given point upon Barsoom by the shortest\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nCarthoris’ improvement upon this consisted of an auxiliary device which\r\nsteered the craft mechanically in the direction of the compass, and\r\nupon arrival directly over the point for which the compass was set,\r\nbrought the craft to a standstill and lowered it, also automatically,\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\n“You readily discern the advantages of this invention,” he was saying\r\nto Thuvan Dihn, who had accompanied him to the landing stage upon the\r\npalace roof to inspect the compass and bid his young friend farewell.\r\n\r\nA dozen officers of the court with several body servants were grouped\r\nbehind the jeddak and his guest, eager listeners to the conversation—so\r\neager on the part of one of the servants that he was twice rebuked by a\r\nnoble for his forwardness in pushing himself ahead of his betters to\r\nview the intricate mechanism of the wonderful “controlling destination\r\ncompass,” as the thing was called.\r\n\r\n“For example,” continued Carthoris, “I have an all-night trip before\r\nme, as to-night. I set the pointer here upon the right-hand dial which\r\nrepresents the eastern hemisphere of Barsoom, so that the point rests\r\nupon the exact latitude and longitude of Helium. Then I start the\r\nengine, roll up in my sleeping silks and furs, and with lights burning,\r\nrace through the air toward Helium, confident that at the appointed\r\nhour I shall drop gently toward the landing stage upon my own palace,\r\nwhether I am still asleep or no.”\r\n\r\n“Provided,” suggested Thuvan Dihn, “you do not chance to collide with\r\nsome other night wanderer in the meanwhile.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris smiled. “No danger of that,” he replied. “See here,” and he\r\nindicated a device at the right of the destination compass. “This is my\r\n‘obstruction evader,’ as I call it. This visible device is the switch\r\nwhich throws the mechanism on or off. The instrument itself is below\r\ndeck, geared both to the steering apparatus and the control levers.\r\n\r\n“It is quite simple, being nothing more than a radium generator\r\ndiffusing radio-activity in all directions to a distance of a hundred\r\nyards or so from the flier. Should this enveloping force be interrupted\r\nin any direction a delicate instrument immediately apprehends the\r\nirregularity, at the same time imparting an impulse to a magnetic\r\ndevice which in turn actuates the steering mechanism, diverting the bow\r\nof the flier away from the obstacle until the craft’s radio-activity\r\nsphere is no longer in contact with the obstruction, then she falls\r\nonce more into her normal course. Should the disturbance approach from\r\nthe rear, as in case of a faster-moving craft overhauling me, the\r\nmechanism actuates the speed control as well as the steering gear, and\r\nthe flier shoots ahead and either up or down, as the oncoming vessel is\r\nupon a lower or higher plane than herself.\r\n\r\n“In aggravated cases, that is when the obstructions are many, or of\r\nsuch a nature as to deflect the bow more than forty-five degrees in any\r\ndirection, or when the craft has reached its destination and dropped to\r\nwithin a hundred yards of the ground, the mechanism brings her to a\r\nfull stop, at the same time sounding a loud alarm which will instantly\r\nawaken the pilot. You see I have anticipated almost every contingency.”\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn smiled his appreciation of the marvellous device. The\r\nforward servant pushed almost to the flier’s side. His eyes were\r\nnarrowed to slits.\r\n\r\n“All but one,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe nobles looked at him in astonishment, and one of them grasped the\r\nfellow none too gently by the shoulder to push him back to his proper\r\nplace. Carthoris raised his hand.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” he urged. “Let us hear what the man has to say—no creation of\r\nmortal mind is perfect. Perchance he has detected a weakness that it\r\nwill be well to know at once. Come, my good fellow, and what may be the\r\none contingency I have overlooked?”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Carthoris observed the servant closely for the first time.\r\nHe saw a man of giant stature and handsome, as are all those of the\r\nrace of Martian red men; but the fellow’s lips were thin and cruel, and\r\nacross one cheek was the faint, white line of a sword-cut from the\r\nright temple to the corner of the mouth.\r\n\r\n“Come,” urged the Prince of Helium. “Speak!”\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated. It was evident that he regretted the temerity that\r\nhad made him the centre of interested observation. But at last, seeing\r\nno alternative, he spoke.\r\n\r\n“It might be tampered with,” he said, “by an enemy.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris drew a small key from his leathern pocket-pouch.\r\n\r\n“Look at this,” he said, handing it to the man. “If you know aught of\r\nlocks, you will know that the mechanism which this unlooses is beyond\r\nthe cunning of a picker of locks. It guards the vitals of the\r\ninstrument from crafty tampering. Without it an enemy must half wreck\r\nthe device to reach its heart, leaving his handiwork apparent to the\r\nmost casual observer.”\r\n\r\nThe servant took the key, glanced at it shrewdly, and then as he made\r\nto return it to Carthoris dropped it upon the marble flagging. Turning\r\nto look for it he planted the sole of his sandal full upon the\r\nglittering object. For an instant he bore all his weight upon the foot\r\nthat covered the key, then he stepped back and with an exclamation as\r\nof pleasure that he had found it, stooped, recovered it, and returned\r\nit to the Heliumite. Then he dropped back to his station behind the\r\nnobles and was forgotten.\r\n\r\nA moment later Carthoris had made his adieux to Thuvan Dihn and his\r\nnobles, and with lights twinkling had risen into the star-shot void of\r\nthe Martian night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the ruler of Ptarth, followed by his courtiers, descended from the\r\nlanding stage above the palace, the servants dropped into their places\r\nin the rear of their royal or noble masters, and behind the others one\r\nlingered to the last. Then quickly stooping he snatched the sandal from\r\nhis right foot, slipping it into his pocket-pouch.\r\n\r\nWhen the party had come to the lower levels, and the jeddak had\r\ndispersed them by a sign, none noticed that the forward fellow who had\r\ndrawn so much attention to himself before the Prince of Helium\r\ndeparted, was no longer among the other servants.\r\n\r\nTo whose retinue he had been attached none had thought to inquire, for\r\nthe followers of a Martian noble are many, coming and going at the whim\r\nof their master, so that a new face is scarcely ever questioned, as the\r\nfact that a man has passed within the palace walls is considered proof\r\npositive that his loyalty to the jeddak is beyond question, so rigid is\r\nthe examination of each who seeks service with the nobles of the court.\r\n\r\nA good rule that, and only relaxed by courtesy in favour of the retinue\r\nof visiting royalty from a friendly foreign power.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the morning of the next day that a giant serving man in\r\nthe harness of the house of a great Ptarth noble passed out into the\r\ncity from the palace gates. Along one broad avenue and then another he\r\nstrode briskly until he had passed beyond the district of the nobles\r\nand had come to the place of shops. Here he sought a pretentious\r\nbuilding that rose spire-like toward the heavens, its outer walls\r\nelaborately wrought with delicate carvings and intricate mosaics.\r\n\r\nIt was the Palace of Peace in which were housed the representatives of\r\nthe foreign powers, or rather in which were located their embassies;\r\nfor the ministers themselves dwelt in gorgeous palaces within the\r\ndistrict occupied by the nobles.\r\n\r\nHere the man sought the embassy of Dusar. A clerk arose questioningly\r\nas he entered, and at his request to have a word with the minister\r\nasked his credentials. The visitor slipped a plain metal armlet from\r\nabove his elbow, and pointing to an inscription upon its inner surface,\r\nwhispered a word or two to the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe latter’s eyes went wide, and his attitude turned at once to one of\r\ndeference. He bowed the stranger to a seat, and hastened to an inner\r\nroom with the armlet in his hand. A moment later he reappeared and\r\nconducted the caller into the presence of the minister.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the two were closeted together, and when at last the\r\ngiant serving man emerged from the inner office his expression was cast\r\nin a smile of sinister satisfaction. From the Palace of Peace he\r\nhurried directly to the palace of the Dusarian minister.\r\n\r\nThat night two swift fliers left the same palace top. One sped its\r\nrapid course toward Helium; the other—\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth strolled in the gardens of her father’s palace, as was\r\nher nightly custom before retiring. Her silks and furs were drawn about\r\nher, for the air of Mars is chill after the sun has taken his quick\r\nplunge beneath the planet’s western verge.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s thoughts wandered from her impending nuptials, that would\r\nmake her empress of Kaol, to the person of the trim young Heliumite who\r\nhad laid his heart at her feet the preceding day.\r\n\r\nWhether it was pity or regret that saddened her expression as she gazed\r\ntoward the southern heavens where she had watched the lights of his\r\nflier disappear the previous night, it would be difficult to say.\r\n\r\nSo, too, is it impossible to conjecture just what her emotions may have\r\nbeen as she discerned the lights of a flier speeding rapidly out of the\r\ndistance from that very direction, as though impelled toward her garden\r\nby the very intensity of the princess’ thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe saw it circle lower above the palace until she was positive that it\r\nbut hovered in preparation for a landing.\r\n\r\nPresently the powerful rays of its searchlight shot downward from the\r\nbow. They fell upon the landing stage for a brief instant, revealing\r\nthe figures of the Ptarthian guard, picking into brilliant points of\r\nfire the gems upon their gorgeous harnesses.\r\n\r\nThen the blazing eye swept onward across the burnished domes and\r\ngraceful minarets, down into court and park and garden to pause at last\r\nupon the ersite bench and the girl standing there beside it, her face\r\nupturned full toward the flier.\r\n\r\nFor but an instant the searchlight halted upon Thuvia of Ptarth, then\r\nit was extinguished as suddenly as it had come to life. The flier\r\npassed on above her to disappear beyond a grove of lofty skeel trees\r\nthat grew within the palace grounds.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood for some time as it had left her, except that her head\r\nwas bent and her eyes downcast in thought.\r\n\r\nWho but Carthoris could it have been? She tried to feel anger that he\r\nshould have returned thus, spying upon her; but she found it difficult\r\nto be angry with the young prince of Helium.\r\n\r\nWhat mad caprice could have induced him so to transgress the etiquette\r\nof nations? For lesser things great powers had gone to war.\r\n\r\nThe princess in her was shocked and angered—but what of the girl!\r\n\r\nAnd the guard—what of them? Evidently they, too, had been so much\r\nsurprised by the unprecedented action of the stranger that they had not\r\neven challenged; but that they had no thought to let the thing go\r\nunnoticed was quickly evidenced by the skirring of motors upon the\r\nlanding stage and the quick shooting airward of a long-lined patrol\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nThuvia watched it dart swiftly eastward. So, too, did other eyes watch.\r\n\r\nWithin the dense shadows of the skeel grove, in a wide avenue beneath\r\no’erspreading foliage, a flier hung a dozen feet above the ground. From\r\nits deck keen eyes watched the far-fanning searchlight of the patrol\r\nboat. No light shone from the enshadowed craft. Upon its deck was the\r\nsilence of the tomb. Its crew of a half-dozen red warriors watched the\r\nlights of the patrol boat diminishing in the distance.\r\n\r\n“The intellects of our ancestors are with us to-night,” said one in a\r\nlow tone.\r\n\r\n“No plan ever carried better,” returned another. “They did precisely as\r\nthe prince foretold.”\r\n\r\nHe who had first spoken turned toward the man who squatted before the\r\ncontrol board.\r\n\r\n“Now!” he whispered. There was no other order given. Every man upon the\r\ncraft had evidently been well schooled in each detail of that night’s\r\nwork. Silently the dark hull crept beneath the cathedral arches of the\r\ndark and silent grove.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth, gazing toward the east, saw the blacker blot against\r\nthe blackness of the trees as the craft topped the buttressed garden\r\nwall. She saw the dim bulk incline gently downward toward the scarlet\r\nsward of the garden.\r\n\r\nShe knew that men came not thus with honourable intent. Yet she did not\r\ncry aloud to alarm the near-by guardsmen, nor did she flee to the\r\nsafety of the palace.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nI can see her shrug her shapely shoulders in reply as she voices the\r\nage-old, universal answer of the woman: Because!\r\n\r\nScarce had the flier touched the ground when four men leaped from its\r\ndeck. They ran forward toward the girl.\r\n\r\nStill she made no sign of alarm, standing as though hypnotized. Or\r\ncould it have been as one who awaited a welcome visitor?\r\n\r\nNot until they were quite close to her did she move. Then the nearer\r\nmoon, rising above the surrounding foliage, touched their faces,\r\nlighting all with the brilliancy of her silver rays.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth saw only strangers—warriors in the harness of Dusar.\r\nNow she took fright, but too late!\r\n\r\nBefore she could voice but a single cry, rough hands seized her. A\r\nheavy silken scarf was wound about her head. She was lifted in strong\r\narms and borne to the deck of the flier. There was the sudden whirl of\r\npropellers, the rushing of air against her body, and, from far beneath\r\nthe shouting and the challenge from the guard.\r\n\r\nRacing toward the south another flier sped toward Helium. In its cabin\r\na tall red man bent over the soft sole of an upturned sandal. With\r\ndelicate instruments he measured the faint imprint of a small object\r\nwhich appeared there. Upon a pad beside him was the outline of a key,\r\nand here he noted the results of his measurements.\r\n\r\nA smile played upon his lips as he completed his task and turned to one\r\nwho waited at the opposite side of the table.\r\n\r\n“The man is a genius,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“Only a genius could have evolved such a lock as this is designed to\r\nspring. Here, take the sketch, Larok, and give all thine own genius\r\nfull and unfettered freedom in reproducing it in metal.”\r\n\r\nThe warrior-artificer bowed. “Man builds naught,” he said, “that man\r\nmay not destroy.” Then he left the cabin with the sketch.\r\n\r\nAs dawn broke upon the lofty towers which mark the twin cities of\r\nHelium—the scarlet tower of one and the yellow tower of its sister—a\r\nflier floated lazily out of the north.\r\n\r\nUpon its bow was emblazoned the signia of a lesser noble of a far city\r\nof the empire of Helium. Its leisurely approach and the evident\r\nconfidence with which it moved across the city aroused no suspicion in\r\nthe minds of the sleepy guard. Their round of duty nearly done, they\r\nhad little thought beyond the coming of those who were to relieve them.\r\n\r\nPeace reigned throughout Helium. Stagnant, emasculating peace. Helium\r\nhad no enemies. There was naught to fear.\r\n\r\nWithout haste the nearest air patrol swung sluggishly about and\r\napproached the stranger. At easy speaking distance the officer upon her\r\ndeck hailed the incoming craft.\r\n\r\nThe cheery “Kaor!” and the plausible explanation that the owner had\r\ncome from distant parts for a few days of pleasure in gay Helium\r\nsufficed. The air-patrol boat sheered off, passing again upon its way.\r\nThe stranger continued toward a public landing stage, where she dropped\r\ninto the ways and came to rest.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time a warrior entered her cabin.\r\n\r\n“It is done, Vas Kor,” he said, handing a small metal key to the tall\r\nnoble who had just risen from his sleeping silks and furs.\r\n\r\n“Good!” exclaimed the latter. “You must have worked upon it all during\r\nthe night, Larok.”\r\n\r\nThe warrior nodded.\r\n\r\n“Now fetch me the Heliumetic metal you wrought some days since,”\r\ncommanded Vas Kor.\r\n\r\nThis done, the warrior assisted his master to replace the handsome\r\njewelled metal of his harness with the plainer ornaments of an ordinary\r\nfighting man of Helium, and with the insignia of the same house that\r\nappeared upon the bow of the flier.\r\n\r\nVas Kor breakfasted on board. Then he emerged upon the aerial dock,\r\nentered an elevator, and was borne quickly to the street below, where\r\nhe was soon engulfed by the early morning throng of workers hastening\r\nto their daily duties.\r\n\r\nAmong them his warrior trappings were no more remarkable than is a pair\r\nof trousers upon Broadway. All Martian men are warriors, save those\r\nphysically unable to bear arms. The tradesman and his clerk clank with\r\ntheir martial trappings as they pursue their vocations. The schoolboy,\r\ncoming into the world, as he does, almost adult from the snowy shell\r\nthat has encompassed his development for five long years, knows so\r\nlittle of life without a sword at his hip that he would feel the same\r\ndiscomfiture at going abroad unarmed that an Earth boy would experience\r\nin walking the streets knicker-bockerless.\r\n\r\nVas Kor’s destination lay in Greater Helium, which lies some\r\nseventy-five miles across the level plain from Lesser Helium. He had\r\nlanded at the latter city because the air patrol is less suspicious and\r\nalert than that above the larger metropolis where lies the palace of\r\nthe jeddak.\r\n\r\nAs he moved with the throng in the parklike canyon of the thoroughfare\r\nthe life of an awakening Martian city was in evidence about him.\r\nHouses, raised high upon their slender metal columns for the night were\r\ndropping gently toward the ground. Among the flowers upon the scarlet\r\nsward which lies about the buildings children were already playing, and\r\ncomely women laughing and chatting with their neighbours as they culled\r\ngorgeous blossoms for the vases within doors.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant “kaor” of the Barsoomian greeting fell continually upon\r\nthe ears of the stranger as friends and neighbours took up the duties\r\nof a new day.\r\n\r\nThe district in which he had landed was residential—a district of\r\nmerchants of the more prosperous sort. Everywhere were evidences of\r\nluxury and wealth. Slaves appeared upon every housetop with gorgeous\r\nsilks and costly furs, laying them in the sun for airing.\r\nJewel-encrusted women lolled even thus early upon the carven balconies\r\nbefore their sleeping apartments. Later in the day they would repair to\r\nthe roofs when the slaves had arranged couches and pitched silken\r\ncanopies to shade them from the sun.\r\n\r\nStrains of inspiring music broke pleasantly from open windows, for the\r\nMartians have solved the problem of attuning the nerves pleasantly to\r\nthe sudden transition from sleep to waking that proves so difficult a\r\nthing for most Earth folk.\r\n\r\nAbove him raced the long, light passenger fliers, plying, each in its\r\nproper plane, between the numerous landing stages for internal\r\npassenger traffic. Landing stages that tower high into the heavens are\r\nfor the great international passenger liners. Freighters have other\r\nlanding stages at various lower levels, to within a couple of hundred\r\nfeet of the ground; nor dare any flier rise or drop from one plane to\r\nanother except in certain restricted districts where horizontal traffic\r\nis forbidden.\r\n\r\nAlong the close-cropped sward which paves the avenue ground fliers were\r\nmoving in continuous lines in opposite directions. For the greater part\r\nthey skimmed along the surface of the sward, soaring gracefully into\r\nthe air at times to pass over a slower-going driver ahead, or at\r\nintersections, where the north and south traffic has the right of way\r\nand the east and west must rise above it.\r\n\r\nFrom private hangars upon many a roof top fliers were darting into the\r\nline of traffic. Gay farewells and parting admonitions mingled with the\r\nwhirring of motors and the subdued noises of the city.\r\n\r\nYet with all the swift movement and the countless thousands rushing\r\nhither and thither, the predominant suggestion was that of luxurious\r\nease and soft noiselessness.\r\n\r\nMartians dislike harsh, discordant clamour. The only loud noises they\r\ncan abide are the martial sounds of war, the clash of arms, the\r\ncollision of two mighty dreadnoughts of the air. To them there is no\r\nsweeter music than this.\r\n\r\nAt the intersection of two broad avenues Vas Kor descended from the\r\nstreet level to one of the great pneumatic stations of the city. Here\r\nhe paid before a little wicket the fare to his destination with a\r\ncouple of the dull, oval coins of Helium.\r\n\r\nBeyond the gatekeeper he came to a slowly moving line of what to\r\nEarthly eyes would have appeared to be conical-nosed, eight-foot\r\nprojectiles for some giant gun. In slow procession the things moved in\r\nsingle file along a grooved track. A half dozen attendants assisted\r\npassengers to enter, or directed these carriers to their proper\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nVas Kor approached one that was empty. Upon its nose was a dial and a\r\npointer. He set the pointer for a certain station in Greater Helium,\r\nraised the arched lid of the thing, stepped in and lay down upon the\r\nupholstered bottom. An attendant closed the lid, which locked with a\r\nlittle click, and the carrier continued its slow way.\r\n\r\nPresently it switched itself automatically to another track, to enter,\r\na moment later, one of the series of dark-mouthed tubes.\r\n\r\nThe instant that its entire length was within the black aperture it\r\nsprang forward with the speed of a rifle ball. There was an instant of\r\nwhizzing—a soft, though sudden, stop, and slowly the carrier emerged\r\nupon another platform, another attendant raised the lid and Vas Kor\r\nstepped out at the station beneath the centre of Greater Helium,\r\nseventy-five miles from the point at which he had embarked.\r\n\r\nHere he sought the street level, stepping immediately into a waiting\r\nground flier. He spoke no word to the slave sitting in the driver’s\r\nseat. It was evident that he had been expected, and that the fellow had\r\nreceived his instructions before his coming.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Vas Kor taken his seat when the flier went quickly into\r\nthe fast-moving procession, turning presently from the broad and\r\ncrowded avenue into a less congested street. Presently it left the\r\nthronged district behind to enter a section of small shops, where it\r\nstopped before the entrance to one which bore the sign of a dealer in\r\nforeign silks.\r\n\r\nVas Kor entered the low-ceiling room. A man at the far end motioned him\r\ntoward an inner apartment, giving no further sign of recognition until\r\nhe had passed in after the caller and closed the door.\r\n\r\nThen he faced his visitor, saluting deferentially.\r\n\r\n“Most noble—” he commenced, but Vas Kor silenced him with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“No formalities,” he said. “We must forget that I am aught other than\r\nyour slave. If all has been as carefully carried out as it has been\r\nplanned, we have no time to waste. Instead we should be upon our way to\r\nthe slave market. Are you ready?”\r\n\r\nThe merchant nodded, and, turning to a great chest, produced the\r\nunemblazoned trappings of a slave. These Vas Kor immediately donned.\r\nThen the two passed from the shop through a rear door, traversed a\r\nwinding alley to an avenue beyond, where they entered a flier which\r\nawaited them.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the merchant was leading his slave to the public\r\nmarket, where a great concourse of people filled the great open space\r\nin the centre of which stood the slave block.\r\n\r\nThe crowds were enormous to-day, for Carthoris, Prince of Helium, was\r\nto be the principal bidder.\r\n\r\nOne by one the masters mounted the rostrum beside the slave block upon\r\nwhich stood their chattels. Briefly and clearly each recounted the\r\nvirtues of his particular offering.\r\n\r\nWhen all were done, the major-domo of the Prince of Helium recalled to\r\nthe block such as had favourably impressed him. For such he had made a\r\nfair offer.\r\n\r\nThere was little haggling as to price, and none at all when Vas Kor was\r\nplaced upon the block. His merchant-master accepted the first offer\r\nthat was made for him, and thus a Dusarian noble entered the household\r\nof Carthoris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTREACHERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day following the coming of Vas Kor to the palace of the Prince of\r\nHelium great excitement reigned throughout the twin cities, reaching\r\nits climax in the palace of Carthoris. Word had come of the abduction\r\nof Thuvia of Ptarth from her father’s court, and with it the veiled\r\nhint that the Prince of Helium might be suspected of considerable\r\nknowledge of the act and the whereabouts of the princess.\r\n\r\nIn the council chamber of John Carter, Warlord of Mars, was Tardos\r\nMors, Jeddak of Helium; Mors Kajak, his son, Jed of Lesser Helium;\r\nCarthoris, and a score of the great nobles of the empire.\r\n\r\n“There must be no war between Ptarth and Helium, my son,” said John\r\nCarter. “That you are innocent of the charge that has been placed\r\nagainst you by insinuation, we well know; but Thuvan Dihn must know it\r\nwell, too.\r\n\r\n“There is but one who may convince him, and that one be you. You must\r\nhasten at once to the court of Ptarth, and by your presence there as\r\nwell as by your words assure him that his suspicions are groundless.\r\nBear with you the authority of the Warlord of Barsoom, and of the\r\nJeddak of Helium to offer every resource of the allied powers to assist\r\nThuvan Dihn to recover his daughter and punish her abductors,\r\nwhomsoever they may be.\r\n\r\n“Go! I know that I do not need to urge upon you the necessity for\r\nhaste.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris left the council chamber, and hastened to his palace.\r\n\r\nHere slaves were busy in a moment setting things to rights for the\r\ndeparture of their master. Several worked about the swift flier that\r\nwould bear the Prince of Helium rapidly toward Ptarth.\r\n\r\nAt last all was done. But two armed slaves remained on guard. The\r\nsetting sun hung low above the horizon. In a moment darkness would\r\nenvelop all.\r\n\r\nOne of the guardsmen, a giant of a fellow across whose right cheek\r\nthere ran a thin scar from temple to mouth, approached his companion.\r\nHis gaze was directed beyond and above his comrade. When he had come\r\nquite close he spoke.\r\n\r\n“What strange craft is that?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe other turned about quickly to gaze heavenward. Scarce was his back\r\nturned toward the giant than the short-sword of the latter was plunged\r\nbeneath his left shoulder blade, straight through his heart.\r\n\r\nVoiceless, the soldier sank in his tracks—stone dead. Quickly the\r\nmurderer dragged the corpse into the black shadows within the hangar.\r\nThen he returned to the flier.\r\n\r\nDrawing a cunningly wrought key from his pocket-pouch, he removed the\r\ncover of the right-hand dial of the controlling destination compass.\r\nFor a moment he studied the construction of the mechanism beneath. Then\r\nhe returned the dial to its place, set the pointer, and removed it\r\nagain to note the resultant change in the position of the parts\r\naffected by the act.\r\n\r\nA smile crossed his lips. With a pair of cutters he snipped off the\r\nprojection which extended through the dial from the external\r\npointer—now the latter might be moved to any point upon the dial\r\nwithout affecting the mechanism below. In other words, the eastern\r\nhemisphere dial was useless.\r\n\r\nNow he turned his attention to the western dial. This he set upon a\r\ncertain point. Afterward he removed the cover of this dial also, and\r\nwith keen tool cut the steel finger from the under side of the pointer.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as possible he replaced the second dial cover, and resumed\r\nhis place on guard. To all intents and purposes the compass was as\r\nefficient as before; but, as a matter of fact, the moving of the\r\npointers upon the dials resulted now in no corresponding shift of the\r\nmechanism beneath—and the device was set, immovably, upon a destination\r\nof the slave’s own choosing.\r\n\r\nPresently came Carthoris, accompanied by but a handful of his\r\ngentlemen. He cast but a casual glance upon the single slave who stood\r\nguard. The fellow’s thin, cruel lips, and the sword-cut that ran from\r\ntemple to mouth aroused the suggestion of an unpleasant memory within\r\nhim. He wondered where Saran Tal had found the man— then the matter\r\nfaded from his thoughts, and in another moment the Prince of Helium was\r\nlaughing and chatting with his companions, though below the surface his\r\nheart was cold with dread, for what contingencies confronted Thuvia of\r\nPtarth he could not even guess.\r\n\r\nFirst to his mind, naturally, had sprung the thought that Astok of\r\nDusar had stolen the fair Ptarthian; but almost simultaneously with the\r\nreport of the abduction had come news of the great fetes at Dusar in\r\nhonour of the return of the jeddak’s son to the court of his father.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been he, thought Carthoris, for on the very night\r\nthat Thuvia was taken Astok had been in Dusar, and yet—\r\n\r\nHe entered the flier, exchanging casual remarks with his companions as\r\nhe unlocked the mechanism of the compass and set the pointer upon the\r\ncapital city of Ptarth.\r\n\r\nWith a word of farewell he touched the button which controlled the\r\nrepulsive rays, and as the flier rose lightly into the air, the engine\r\npurred in answer to the touch of his finger upon a second button, the\r\npropellers whirred as his hand drew back the speed lever, and\r\nCarthoris, Prince of Helium, was off into the gorgeous Martian night\r\nbeneath the hurtling moons and the million stars.\r\n\r\nScarce had the flier found its speed ere the man, wrapping his sleeping\r\nsilks and furs about him, stretched at full length upon the narrow deck\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nBut sleep did not come at once at his bidding.\r\n\r\nInstead, his thoughts ran riot in his brain, driving sleep away. He\r\nrecalled the words of Thuvia of Ptarth, words that had half assured him\r\nthat she loved him; for when he had asked her if she loved Kulan Tith,\r\nshe had answered only that she was promised to him.\r\n\r\nNow he saw that her reply was open to more than a single construction.\r\nIt might, of course, mean that she did not love Kulan Tith; and so, by\r\ninference, be taken to mean that she loved another.\r\n\r\nBut what assurance was there that the other was Carthoris of Helium?\r\n\r\nThe more he thought upon it the more positive he became that not only\r\nwas there no assurance in her words that she loved him, but none either\r\nin any act of hers. No, the fact was, she did not love him. She loved\r\nanother. She had not been abducted—she had fled willingly with her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nWith such pleasant thoughts filling him alternately with despair and\r\nrage, Carthoris at last dropped into the sleep of utter mental\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe breaking of the sudden dawn found him still asleep. His flier was\r\nrushing swiftly above a barren, ochre plain—the world-old bottom of a\r\nlong-dead Martian sea.\r\n\r\nIn the distance rose low hills. Toward these the craft was headed. As\r\nit approached them, a great promontory might have been seen from its\r\ndeck, stretching out into what had once been a mighty ocean, and\r\ncircling back once more to enclose the forgotten harbour of a forgotten\r\ncity, which still stretched back from its deserted quays, an imposing\r\npile of wondrous architecture of a long-dead past.\r\n\r\nThe countless dismal windows, vacant and forlorn, stared, sightless,\r\nfrom their marble walls; the whole sad city taking on the semblance of\r\nscattered mounds of dead men’s sun-bleached skulls—the casements having\r\nthe appearance of eyeless sockets, the portals, grinning jaws.\r\n\r\nCloser came the flier, but now its speed was diminishing—yet this was\r\nnot Ptarth.\r\n\r\nAbove the central plaza it stopped, slowly settling Marsward. Within a\r\nhundred yards of the ground it came to rest, floating gently in the\r\nlight air, and at the same instant an alarm sounded at the sleeper’s\r\near.\r\n\r\nCarthoris sprang to his feet. Below him he looked to see the teeming\r\nmetropolis of Ptarth. Beside him, already, there should have been an\r\nair patrol.\r\n\r\nHe gazed about in bewildered astonishment. There indeed was a great\r\ncity, but it was not Ptarth. No multitudes surged through its broad\r\navenues. No signs of life broke the dead monotony of its deserted roof\r\ntops. No gorgeous silks, no priceless furs lent life and colour to the\r\ncold marble and the gleaming ersite.\r\n\r\nNo patrol boat lay ready with its familiar challenge. Silent and empty\r\nlay the great city—empty and silent the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened?\r\n\r\nCarthoris examined the dial of his compass. The pointer was set upon\r\nPtarth. Could the creature of his genius have thus betrayed him? He\r\nwould not believe it.\r\n\r\nQuickly he unlocked the cover, turning it back upon its hinge. A single\r\nglance showed him the truth, or at least a part of it—the steel\r\nprojection that communicated the movement of the pointer upon the dial\r\nto the heart of the mechanism beneath had been severed.\r\n\r\nWho could have done the thing—and why?\r\n\r\nCarthoris could not hazard even a faint guess. But the thing now was to\r\nlearn in what portion of the world he was, and then take up his\r\ninterrupted journey once more.\r\n\r\nIf it had been the purpose of some enemy to delay him, he had succeeded\r\nwell, thought Carthoris, as he unlocked the cover of the second dial,\r\nthe first having shown that its pointer had not been set at all.\r\n\r\nBeneath the second dial he found the steel pin severed as in the other,\r\nbut the controlling mechanism had first been set for a point upon the\r\nwestern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nHe had just time to judge his location roughly at some place south-west\r\nof Helium, and at a considerable distance from the twin cities, when he\r\nwas startled by a woman’s scream beneath him.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the side of the flier, he saw what appeared to be a red\r\nwoman being dragged across the plaza by a huge green warrior—one of\r\nthose fierce, cruel denizens of the dead sea-bottoms and deserted\r\ncities of dying Mars.\r\n\r\nCarthoris waited to see no more. Reaching for the control board, he\r\nsent his craft racing plummet-like toward the ground.\r\n\r\nThe green man was hurrying his captive toward a huge thoat that browsed\r\nupon the ochre vegetation of the once scarlet-gorgeous plaza. At the\r\nsame instant a dozen red warriors leaped from the entrance of a nearby\r\nersite palace, pursuing the abductor with naked swords and shouts of\r\nrageful warning.\r\n\r\nOnce the woman turned her face upward toward the falling flier, and in\r\nthe single swift glance Carthoris saw that it was Thuvia of Ptarth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nA GREEN MAN’S CAPTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the light of day broke upon the little craft to whose deck the\r\nPrincess of Ptarth had been snatched from her father’s garden, Thuvia\r\nsaw that the night had wrought a change in her abductors.\r\n\r\nNo longer did their trappings gleam with the metal of Dusar, but\r\ninstead there was emblazoned there the insignia of the Prince of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\nThe girl felt renewed hope, for she could not believe that in the heart\r\nof Carthoris could lie intent to harm her.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to the warrior squatting before the control board.\r\n\r\n“Last night you wore the trappings of a Dusarian,” she said. “Now your\r\nmetal is that of Helium. What means it?”\r\n\r\nThe man looked at her with a grin.\r\n\r\n“The Prince of Helium is no fool,” he said.\r\n\r\nJust then an officer emerged from the tiny cabin. He reprimanded the\r\nwarrior for conversing with the prisoner, nor would he himself reply to\r\nany of her inquiries.\r\n\r\nNo harm was offered her during the journey, and so they came at last to\r\ntheir destination with the girl no wiser as to her abductors or their\r\npurpose than at first.\r\n\r\nHere the flier settled slowly into the plaza of one of those mute\r\nmonuments of Mars’ dead and forgotten past—the deserted cities that\r\nfringe the sad ochre sea-bottoms where once rolled the mighty floods\r\nupon whose bosoms moved the maritime commerce of the peoples that are\r\ngone for ever.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth was no stranger to such places. During her wanderings\r\nin search of the River Iss, that time she had set out upon what, for\r\ncountless ages, had been the last, long pilgrimage of Martians, toward\r\nthe Valley Dor, where lies the Lost Sea of Korus, she had encountered\r\nseveral of these sad reminders of the greatness and the glory of\r\nancient Barsoom.\r\n\r\nAnd again, during her flight from the temples of the Holy Therns with\r\nTars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, she had seen them, with their weird and\r\nghostly inmates, the great white apes of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nShe knew, too, that many of them were used now by the nomadic tribes of\r\ngreen men, but that among them all was no city that the red men did not\r\nshun, for without exception they stood amidst vast, waterless tracts,\r\nunsuited for the continued sustenance of the dominant race of Martians.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, should they be bringing her to such a place? There was but a\r\nsingle answer. Such was the nature of their work that they must needs\r\nseek the seclusion that a dead city afforded. The girl trembled at\r\nthought of her plight.\r\n\r\nFor two days her captors kept her within a huge palace that even in\r\ndecay reflected the splendour of the age which its youth had known.\r\n\r\nJust before dawn on the third day she had been aroused by the voices of\r\ntwo of her abductors.\r\n\r\n“He should be here by dawn,” one was saying. “Have her in readiness\r\nupon the plaza—else he will never land. The moment he finds that he is\r\nin a strange country he will turn about—methinks the prince’s plan is\r\nweak in this one spot.”\r\n\r\n“There was no other way,” replied the other. “It is wondrous work to\r\nget them both here at all, and even if we do not succeed in luring him\r\nto the ground, we shall have accomplished much.”\r\n\r\nJust then the speaker caught the eyes of Thuvia upon him, revealed by\r\nthe quick-moving patch of light cast by _Thuria_ in her mad race\r\nthrough the heavens.\r\n\r\nWith a quick sign to the other, he ceased speaking, and advancing\r\ntoward the girl, motioned her to rise. Then he led her out into the\r\nnight toward the centre of the great plaza.\r\n\r\n“Stand here,” he commanded, “until we come for you. We shall be\r\nwatching, and should you attempt to escape it will go ill with you—much\r\nworse than death. Such are the prince’s orders.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned and retraced his steps toward the palace, leaving her\r\nalone in the midst of the unseen terrors of the haunted city, for in\r\ntruth these places are haunted in the belief of many Martians who still\r\ncling to an ancient superstition which teaches that the spirits of Holy\r\nTherns who die before their allotted one thousand years, pass, on\r\noccasions, into the bodies of the great white apes.\r\n\r\nTo Thuvia, however, the real danger of attack by one of these\r\nferocious, manlike beasts was quite sufficient. She no longer believed\r\nin the weird soul transmigration that the therns had taught her before\r\nshe was rescued from their clutches by John Carter; but she well knew\r\nthe horrid fate that awaited her should one of the terrible beasts\r\nchance to spy her during its nocturnal prowlings.\r\n\r\nWhat was that?\r\n\r\nSurely she could not be mistaken. Something had moved, stealthily, in\r\nthe shadow of one of the great monoliths that line the avenue where it\r\nentered the plaza opposite her!\r\n\r\nThar Ban, jed among the hordes of Torquas, rode swiftly across the\r\nochre vegetation of the dead sea-bottom toward the ruins of ancient\r\nAaanthor.\r\n\r\nHe had ridden far that night, and fast, for he had but come from the\r\ndespoiling of the incubator of a neighbouring green horde with which\r\nthe hordes of Torquas were perpetually warring.\r\n\r\nHis giant thoat was far from jaded, yet it would be well, thought Thar\r\nBan, to permit him to graze upon the ochre moss which grows to greater\r\nheight within the protected courtyards of deserted cities, where the\r\nsoil is richer than on the sea-bottoms, and the plants partly shaded\r\nfrom the sun during the cloudless Martian day.\r\n\r\nWithin the tiny stems of this dry-seeming plant is sufficient moisture\r\nfor the needs of the huge bodies of the mighty thoats, which can exist\r\nfor months without water, and for days without even the slight moisture\r\nwhich the ochre moss contains.\r\n\r\nAs Thar Ban rode noiselessly up the broad avenue which leads from the\r\nquays of Aaanthor to the great central plaza, he and his mount might\r\nhave been mistaken for spectres from a world of dreams, so grotesque\r\nthe man and beast, so soundless the great thoat’s padded, nailless feet\r\nupon the moss-grown flagging of the ancient pavement.\r\n\r\nThe man was a splendid specimen of his race. Fully fifteen feet towered\r\nhis great height from sole to pate. The moonlight glistened against his\r\nglossy green hide, sparkling the jewels of his heavy harness and the\r\nornaments that weighted his four muscular arms, while the upcurving\r\ntusks that protruded from his lower jaw gleamed white and terrible.\r\n\r\nAt the side of his thoat were slung his long radium rifle and his\r\ngreat, forty-foot, metal-shod spear, while from his own harness\r\ndepended his long-sword and his short-sword, as well as his lesser\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nHis protruding eyes and antennae-like ears were turning constantly\r\nhither and thither, for Thar Ban was yet in the country of the enemy,\r\nand, too, there was always the menace of the great white apes, which,\r\nJohn Carter was wont to say, are the only creatures that can arouse in\r\nthe breasts of these fierce denizens of the dead sea-bottoms even the\r\nremotest semblance of fear.\r\n\r\nAs the rider neared the plaza, he reined suddenly in. His slender,\r\ntubular ears pointed rigidly forward. An unwonted sound had reached\r\nthem. Voices! And where there were voices, outside of Torquas, there,\r\ntoo, were enemies. All the world of wide Barsoom contained naught but\r\nenemies for the fierce Torquasians.\r\n\r\nThar Ban dismounted. Keeping in the shadows of the great monoliths that\r\nline the Avenue of Quays of sleeping Aaanthor, he approached the plaza.\r\nDirectly behind him, as a hound at heel, came the slate-grey thoat, his\r\nwhite belly shadowed by his barrel, his vivid yellow feet merging into\r\nthe yellow of the moss beneath them.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the plaza Thar Ban saw the figure of a red woman. A\r\nred warrior was conversing with her. Now the man turned and retraced\r\nhis steps toward the palace at the opposite side of the plaza.\r\n\r\nThar Ban watched until he had disappeared within the yawning portal.\r\nHere was a captive worth having! Seldom did a female of their\r\nhereditary enemies fall to the lot of a green man. Thar Ban licked his\r\nthin lips.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth watched the shadow behind the monolith at the opening\r\nto the avenue opposite her. She hoped that it might be but the figment\r\nof an overwrought imagination.\r\n\r\nBut no! Now, clearly and distinctly, she saw it move. It came from\r\nbehind the screening shelter of the ersite shaft.\r\n\r\nThe sudden light of the rising sun fell upon it. The girl trembled. The\r\n_thing_ was a huge green warrior!\r\n\r\nSwiftly it sprang toward her. She screamed and tried to flee; but she\r\nhad scarce turned toward the palace when a giant hand fell upon her\r\narm, she was whirled about, and half dragged, half carried toward a\r\nhuge thoat that was slowly grazing out of the avenue’s mouth onto the\r\nochre moss of the plaza.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant she turned her face upward toward the whirring\r\nsound of something above her, and there she saw a swift flier dropping\r\ntoward her, the head and shoulders of a man leaning far over the side;\r\nbut the man’s features were deeply shadowed, so that she did not\r\nrecognize them.\r\n\r\nNow from behind her came the shouts of her red abductors. They were\r\nracing madly after him who dared to steal what they already had stolen.\r\n\r\nAs Thar Ban reached the side of his mount he snatched his long radium\r\nrifle from its boot, and, wheeling, poured three shots into the\r\noncoming red men.\r\n\r\nSuch is the uncanny marksmanship of these Martian savages that three\r\nred warriors dropped in their tracks as three projectiles exploded in\r\ntheir vitals.\r\n\r\nThe others halted, nor did they dare return the fire for fear of\r\nwounding the girl.\r\n\r\nThen Thar Ban vaulted to the back of his thoat, Thuvia of Ptarth still\r\nin his arms, and with a savage cry of triumph disappeared down the\r\nblack canyon of the Avenue of Quays between the sullen palaces of\r\nforgotten Aaanthor.\r\n\r\nCarthoris’ flier had not touched the ground before he had sprung from\r\nits deck to race after the swift thoat, whose eight long legs were\r\nsending it down the avenue at the rate of an express train; but the men\r\nof Dusar who still remained alive had no mind to permit so valuable a\r\ncapture to escape them.\r\n\r\nThey had lost the girl. That would be a difficult thing to explain to\r\nAstok; but some leniency might be expected could they carry the Prince\r\nof Helium to their master instead.\r\n\r\nSo the three who remained set upon Carthoris with their long-swords,\r\ncrying to him to surrender; but they might as successfully have cried\r\naloud to _Thuria_ to cease her mad hurtling through the Barsoomian sky,\r\nfor Carthoris of Helium was a true son of the Warlord of Mars and his\r\nincomparable Dejah Thoris.\r\n\r\nCarthoris’ long-sword had been already in his hand as he leaped from\r\nthe deck of the flier, so the instant that he realized the menace of\r\nthe three red warriors, he wheeled to face them, meeting their\r\nonslaught as only John Carter himself might have done.\r\n\r\nSo swift his sword, so mighty and agile his half-earthly muscles, that\r\none of his opponents was down, crimsoning the ochre moss with his\r\nlife-blood, when he had scarce made a single pass at Carthoris.\r\n\r\nNow the two remaining Dusarians rushed simultaneously upon the\r\nHeliumite. Three long-swords clashed and sparkled in the moonlight,\r\nuntil the great white apes, roused from their slumbers, crept to the\r\nlowering windows of the dead city to view the bloody scene beneath\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThrice was Carthoris touched, so that the red blood ran down his face,\r\nblinding him and dyeing his broad chest. With his free hand he wiped\r\nthe gore from his eyes, and with the fighting smile of his father\r\ntouching his lips, leaped upon his antagonists with renewed fury.\r\n\r\nA single cut of his heavy sword severed the head of one of them, and\r\nthen the other, backing away clear of that point of death, turned and\r\nfled toward the palace at his back.\r\n\r\nCarthoris made no step to pursue. He had other concern than the meting\r\nof even well-deserved punishment to strange men who masqueraded in the\r\nmetal of his own house, for he had seen that these men were tricked out\r\nin the insignia that marked his personal followers.\r\n\r\nTurning quickly toward his flier, he was soon rising from the plaza in\r\npursuit of Thar Ban.\r\n\r\nThe red warrior whom he had put to flight turned in the entrance to the\r\npalace, and, seeing Carthoris’ intent, snatched a rifle from those that\r\nhe and his fellows had left leaning against the wall as they had rushed\r\nout with drawn swords to prevent the theft of their prisoner.\r\n\r\nFew red men are good shots, for the sword is their chosen weapon; so\r\nnow as the Dusarian drew bead upon the rising flier, and touched the\r\nbutton upon his rifle’s stock, it was more to chance than proficiency\r\nthat he owed the partial success of his aim.\r\n\r\nThe projectile grazed the flier’s side, the opaque coating breaking\r\nsufficiently to permit daylight to strike in upon the powder phial\r\nwithin the bullet’s nose. There was a sharp explosion. Carthoris felt\r\nhis craft reel drunkenly beneath him, and the engine stopped.\r\n\r\nThe momentum the air boat had gained carried her on over the city\r\ntoward the sea-bottom beyond.\r\n\r\nThe red warrior in the plaza fired several more shots, none of which\r\nscored. Then a lofty minaret shut the drifting quarry from his view.\r\n\r\nIn the distance before him Carthoris could see the green warrior\r\nbearing Thuvia of Ptarth away upon his mighty thoat. The direction of\r\nhis flight was toward the north-west of Aaanthor, where lay a\r\nmountainous country little known to red men.\r\n\r\nThe Heliumite now gave his attention to his injured craft. A close\r\nexamination revealed the fact that one of the buoyancy tanks had been\r\npunctured, but the engine itself was uninjured.\r\n\r\nA splinter from the projectile had damaged one of the control levers\r\nbeyond the possibility of repair outside a machine shop; but after\r\nconsiderable tinkering, Carthoris was able to propel his wounded flier\r\nat low speed, a rate which could not approach the rapid gait of the\r\nthoat, whose eight long, powerful legs carried it over the ochre\r\nvegetation of the dead sea-bottom at terrific speed.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Helium chafed and fretted at the slowness of his pursuit,\r\nyet he was thankful that the damage was no worse, for now he could at\r\nleast move more rapidly than on foot.\r\n\r\nBut even this meagre satisfaction was soon to be denied him, for\r\npresently the flier commenced to sag toward the port and by the bow.\r\nThe damage to the buoyancy tanks had evidently been more grievous than\r\nhe had at first believed.\r\n\r\nAll the balance of that long day Carthoris crawled erratically through\r\nthe still air, the bow of the flier sinking lower and lower, and the\r\nlist to port becoming more and more alarming, until at last, near dark,\r\nhe was floating almost bow-down, his harness buckled to a heavy deck\r\nring to keep him from being precipitated to the ground below.\r\n\r\nHis forward movement was now confined to a slow drifting with the\r\ngentle breeze that blew out of the south-east, and when this died down\r\nwith the setting of the sun, he let the flier sink gently to the mossy\r\ncarpet beneath.\r\n\r\nFar before him loomed the mountains toward which the green man had been\r\nfleeing when last he had seen him, and with dogged resolution the son\r\nof John Carter, endowed with the indomitable will of his mighty sire,\r\ntook up the pursuit on foot.\r\n\r\nAll that night he forged ahead until, with the dawning of a new day, he\r\nentered the low foothills that guard the approach to the fastness of\r\nthe mountains of Torquas.\r\n\r\nRugged, granitic walls towered before him. Nowhere could he discern an\r\nopening through the formidable barrier; yet somewhere into this\r\ninhospitable world of stone the green warrior had borne the woman of\r\nthe red man’s heart’s desire.\r\n\r\nAcross the yielding moss of the sea-bottom there had been no spoor to\r\nfollow, for the soft pads of the thoat but pressed down in his swift\r\npassage the resilient vegetation which sprang up again behind his\r\nfleeting feet, leaving no sign.\r\n\r\nBut here in the hills, where loose rock occasionally strewed the way;\r\nwhere black loam and wild flowers partially replaced the sombre\r\nmonotony of the waste places of the lowlands, Carthoris hoped to find\r\nsome sign that would lead him in the right direction.\r\n\r\nYet, search as he would, the baffling mystery of the trail seemed\r\nlikely to remain for ever unsolved.\r\n\r\nIt was drawing toward the day’s close once more when the keen eyes of\r\nthe Heliumite discerned the tawny yellow of a sleek hide moving among\r\nthe boulders several hundred yards to his left.\r\n\r\nCrouching quickly behind a large rock, Carthoris watched the thing\r\nbefore him. It was a huge banth, one of those savage Barsoomian lions\r\nthat roam the desolate hills of the dying planet.\r\n\r\nThe creature’s nose was close to the ground. It was evident that he was\r\nfollowing the spoor of meat by scent.\r\n\r\nAs Carthoris watched him, a great hope leaped into the man’s heart.\r\nHere, possibly, might lie the solution to the mystery he had been\r\nendeavouring to solve. This hungry carnivore, keen always for the flesh\r\nof man, might even now be trailing the two whom Carthoris sought.\r\n\r\nCautiously the youth crept out upon the trail of the man-eater. Along\r\nthe foot of the perpendicular cliff the creature moved, sniffing at the\r\ninvisible spoor, and now and then emitting the low moan of the hunting\r\nbanth.\r\n\r\nCarthoris had followed the creature for but a few minutes when it\r\ndisappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as though dissolved into thin\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe man leaped to his feet. Not again was he to be cheated as the man\r\nhad cheated him. He sprang forward at a reckless pace to the spot at\r\nwhich he last had seen the great, skulking brute.\r\n\r\nBefore him loomed the sheer cliff, its face unbroken by any aperture\r\ninto which the huge banth might have wormed its great carcass. Beside\r\nhim was a small, flat boulder, not larger than the deck of a ten-man\r\nflier, nor standing to a greater height than twice his own stature.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the banth was in hiding behind this? The brute might have\r\ndiscovered the man upon his trail, and even now be lying in wait for\r\nhis easy prey.\r\n\r\nCautiously, with drawn long-sword, Carthoris crept around the corner of\r\nthe rock. There was no banth there, but something which surprised him\r\ninfinitely more than would the presence of twenty banths.\r\n\r\nBefore him yawned the mouth of a dark cave leading downward into the\r\nground. Through this the banth must have disappeared. Was it his lair?\r\nWithin its dark and forbidding interior might there not lurk not one\r\nbut many of the fearsome creatures?\r\n\r\nCarthoris did not know, nor, with the thought that had been spurring\r\nhim onward upon the trail of the creature uppermost in his mind, did he\r\nmuch care; for into this gloomy cavern he was sure the banth had\r\ntrailed the green man and his captive, and into it he, too, would\r\nfollow, content to give his life in the service of the woman he loved.\r\n\r\nNot an instant did he hesitate, nor yet did he advance rashly; but with\r\nready sword and cautious steps, for the way was dark, he stole on. As\r\nhe advanced, the obscurity became impenetrable blackness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE FAIR RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nDownward along a smooth, broad floor led the strange tunnel, for such\r\nCarthoris was now convinced was the nature of the shaft he at first had\r\nthought but a cave.\r\n\r\nBefore him he could hear the occasional low moans of the banth, and\r\npresently from behind came a similar uncanny note. Another banth had\r\nentered the passageway on _his_ trail!\r\n\r\nHis position was anything but pleasant. His eyes could not penetrate\r\nthe darkness even to the distinguishing of his hand before his face,\r\nwhile the banths, he knew, could see quite well, though absence of\r\nlight were utter.\r\n\r\nNo other sounds came to his ears than the dismal, bloodthirsty moanings\r\nof the beast ahead and the beast behind.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel had led straight, from where he had entered it beneath the\r\nside of the rock furthest from the unscaleable cliffs, toward the\r\nmighty barrier that had baffled him so long.\r\n\r\nNow it was running almost level, and presently he noted a gradual\r\nascent.\r\n\r\nThe beast behind him was gaining upon him, crowding him perilously\r\nclose upon the heels of the beast in front. Presently he should have to\r\ndo battle with one, or both. More firmly he gripped his weapon.\r\n\r\nNow he could hear the breathing of the banth at his heels. Not for much\r\nlonger could he delay the encounter.\r\n\r\nLong since he had become assured that the tunnel led beneath the cliffs\r\nto the opposite side of the barrier, and he had hoped that he might\r\nreach the moonlit open before being compelled to grapple with either of\r\nthe monsters.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been setting as he entered the tunnel, and the way had been\r\nsufficiently long to assure him that darkness now reigned upon the\r\nworld without. He glanced behind him. Blazing out of the darkness,\r\nseemingly not ten paces behind, glared two flaming points of fire. As\r\nthe savage eyes met his, the beast emitted a frightful roar and then he\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nTo face that savage mountain of onrushing ferocity, to stand unshaken\r\nbefore the hideous fangs that he knew were bared in slavering\r\nblood-thirstiness, though he could not see them, required nerves of\r\nsteel; but of such were the nerves of Carthoris of Helium.\r\n\r\nHe had the brute’s eyes to guide his point, and, as true as the sword\r\nhand of his mighty sire, his guided the keen point to one of those\r\nblazing orbs, even as he leaped lightly to one side.\r\n\r\nWith a hideous scream of pain and rage, the wounded banth hurtled,\r\nclawing, past him. Then it turned to charge once more; but this time\r\nCarthoris saw but a single gleaming point of fiery hate directed upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAgain the needle point met its flashing target. Again the horrid cry of\r\nthe stricken beast reverberated through the rocky tunnel, shocking in\r\nits torture-laden shrillness, deafening in its terrific volume.\r\n\r\nBut now, as it turned to charge again, the man had no guide whereby to\r\ndirect his point. He heard the scraping of the padded feet upon the\r\nrocky floor. He knew the thing was charging down upon him once again,\r\nbut he could see nothing.\r\n\r\nYet, if he could not see his antagonist, neither could his antagonist\r\nnow see him.\r\n\r\nLeaping, as he thought, to the exact centre of the tunnel, he held his\r\nsword point ready on a line with the beast’s chest. It was all that he\r\ncould do, hoping that chance might send the point into the savage heart\r\nas he went down beneath the great body.\r\n\r\nSo quickly was the thing over that Carthoris could scarce believe his\r\nsenses as the mighty body rushed madly past him. Either he had not\r\nplaced himself in the centre of the tunnel, or else the blinded banth\r\nhad erred in its calculations.\r\n\r\nHowever, the huge body missed him by a foot, and the creature continued\r\non down the tunnel as though in pursuit of the prey that had eluded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCarthoris, too, followed the same direction, nor was it long before his\r\nheart was gladdened by the sight of the moonlit exit from the long,\r\ndark passage.\r\n\r\nBefore him lay a deep hollow, entirely surrounded by gigantic cliffs.\r\nThe surface of the valley was dotted with enormous trees, a strange\r\nsight so far from a Martian waterway. The ground itself was clothed in\r\nbrilliant scarlet sward, picked out with innumerable patches of\r\ngorgeous wild flowers.\r\n\r\nBeneath the glorious effulgence of the two moons the scene was one of\r\nindescribable loveliness, tinged with the weirdness of strange\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\nFor only an instant, however, did his gaze rest upon the natural\r\nbeauties outspread before him. Almost immediately they were riveted\r\nupon the figure of a great banth standing across the carcass of a\r\nnew-killed thoat.\r\n\r\nThe huge beast, his tawny mane bristling around his hideous head, kept\r\nhis eyes fixed upon another banth that charged erratically hither and\r\nthither, with shrill screams of pain, and horrid roars of hate and\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nCarthoris quickly guessed that the second brute was the one he had\r\nblinded during the fight in the tunnel, but it was the dead thoat that\r\ncentred his interest more than either of the savage carnivores.\r\n\r\nThe harness was still upon the body of the huge Martian mount, and\r\nCarthoris could not doubt but that this was the very animal upon which\r\nthe green warrior had borne away Thuvia of Ptarth.\r\n\r\nBut where were the rider and his prisoner? The Prince of Helium\r\nshuddered as he thought upon the probability of the fate that had\r\novertaken them.\r\n\r\nHuman flesh is the food most craved by the fierce Barsoomian lion,\r\nwhose great carcass and giant thews require enormous quantities of meat\r\nto sustain them.\r\n\r\nTwo human bodies would have but whetted the creature’s appetite, and\r\nthat he had killed and eaten the green man and the red girl seemed only\r\ntoo likely to Carthoris. He had left the carcass of the mighty thoat to\r\nbe devoured after having consumed the more tooth-some portion of his\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nNow the sightless banth, in its savage, aimless charging and\r\ncounter-charging, had passed beyond the kill of its fellow, and there\r\nthe light breeze that was blowing wafted the scent of new blood to its\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\nNo longer were its movements erratic. With outstretched tail and\r\nfoaming jaws it charged straight as an arrow, for the body of the thoat\r\nand the mighty creature of destruction that stood with forepaws upon\r\nthe slate-grey side, waiting to defend its meat.\r\n\r\nWhen the charging banth was twenty paces from the dead thoat the killer\r\ngave vent to its hideous challenge, and with a mighty spring leaped\r\nforward to meet it.\r\n\r\nThe battle that ensued awed even the warlike Barsoomian. The mad\r\nrending, the hideous and deafening roaring, the implacable savagery of\r\nthe blood-stained beasts held him in the paralysis of fascination, and\r\nwhen it was over and the two creatures, their heads and shoulders torn\r\nto ribbons, lay with their dead jaws still buried in each other’s\r\nbodies, Carthoris tore himself from the spell only by an effort of the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nHurrying to the side of the dead thoat, he searched for traces of the\r\ngirl he feared had shared the thoat’s fate, but nowhere could he\r\ndiscover anything to confirm his fears.\r\n\r\nWith slightly lightened heart he started out to explore the valley, but\r\nscarce a dozen steps had he taken when the glistening of a jewelled\r\nbauble lying on the sward caught his eye.\r\n\r\nAs he picked it up his first glance showed him that it was a woman’s\r\nhair ornament, and emblazoned upon it was the insignia of the royal\r\nhouse of Ptarth.\r\n\r\nBut, sinister discovery, blood, still wet, splotched the magnificent\r\njewels of the setting.\r\n\r\nCarthoris half choked as the dire possibilities which the thing\r\nsuggested presented themselves to his imagination. Yet he could not,\r\nwould not believe it.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that that radiant creature could have met so hideous\r\nan end. It was incredible that the glorious Thuvia should ever cease to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nUpon his already jewel-encrusted harness, to the strap that crossed his\r\ngreat chest beneath which beat his loyal heart, Carthoris, Prince of\r\nHelium, fastened the gleaming thing that Thuvia of Ptarth had worn, and\r\nwearing, had made holy to the Heliumite.\r\n\r\nThen he proceeded upon his way into the heart of the unknown valley.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the giant trees shut off his view to any but the most\r\nlimited distances. Occasionally he caught glimpses of the towering\r\nhills that bounded the valley upon every side, and though they stood\r\nout clear beneath the light of the two moons, he knew that they were\r\nfar off, and that the extent of the valley was immense.\r\n\r\nFor half the night he continued his search, until presently he was\r\nbrought to a sudden halt by the distant sound of squealing thoats.\r\n\r\nGuided by the noise of these habitually angry beasts, he stole forward\r\nthrough the trees until at last he came upon a level, treeless plain,\r\nin the centre of which a mighty city reared its burnished domes and\r\nvividly coloured towers.\r\n\r\nAbout the walled city the red man saw a huge encampment of the green\r\nwarriors of the dead sea-bottoms, and as he let his eyes rove carefully\r\nover the city he realized that here was no deserted metropolis of a\r\ndead past.\r\n\r\nBut what city could it be? His studies had taught him that in this\r\nlittle-explored portion of Barsoom the fierce tribe of Torquasian green\r\nmen ruled supreme, and that as yet no red man had succeeded in piercing\r\nto the heart of their domain to return again to the world of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe men of Torquas had perfected huge guns with which their uncanny\r\nmarksmanship had permitted them to repulse the few determined efforts\r\nthat near-by red nations had made to explore their country by means of\r\nbattle fleets of airships.\r\n\r\nThat he was within the boundary of Torquas, Carthoris was sure, but\r\nthat there existed there such a wondrous city he never had dreamed, nor\r\nhad the chronicles of the past even hinted at such a possibility, for\r\nthe Torquasians were known to live, as did the other green men of Mars,\r\nwithin the deserted cities that dotted the dying planet, nor ever had\r\nany green horde built so much as a single edifice, other than the\r\nlow-walled incubators where their young are hatched by the sun’s heat.\r\n\r\nThe encircling camp of green warriors lay about five hundred yards from\r\nthe city’s walls. Between it and the city was no semblance of\r\nbreastwork or other protection against rifle or cannon fire; yet\r\ndistinctly now in the light of the rising sun Carthoris could see many\r\nfigures moving along the summit of the high wall, and upon the roof\r\ntops beyond.\r\n\r\nThat they were beings like himself he was sure, though they were at too\r\ngreat distance from him for him to be positive that they were red men.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after sunrise the green warriors commenced firing\r\nupon the little figures upon the wall. To Carthoris’ surprise the fire\r\nwas not returned, but presently the last of the city’s inhabitants had\r\nsought shelter from the weird marksmanship of the green men, and no\r\nfurther sign of life was visible beyond the wall.\r\n\r\nThen Carthoris, keeping within the shelter of the trees that fringed\r\nthe plain, began circling the rear of the besiegers’ line, hoping\r\nagainst hope that somewhere he would obtain sight of Thuvia of Ptarth,\r\nfor even now he could not believe that she was dead.\r\n\r\nThat he was not discovered was a miracle, for mounted warriors were\r\nconstantly riding back and forth from the camp into the forest; but the\r\nlong day wore on and still he continued his seemingly fruitless quest,\r\nuntil, near sunset, he came opposite a mighty gate in the city’s\r\nwestern wall.\r\n\r\nHere seemed to be the principal force of the attacking horde. Here a\r\ngreat platform had been erected whereon Carthoris could see squatting a\r\nhuge green warrior, surrounded by others of his kind.\r\n\r\nThis, then, must be the notorious Hortan Gur, Jeddak of Torquas, the\r\nfierce old ogre of the south-western hemisphere, as only for a jeddak\r\nare platforms raised in temporary camps or upon the march by the green\r\nhordes of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nAs the Heliumite watched he saw another green warrior push his way\r\nforward toward the rostrum. Beside him he dragged a captive, and as the\r\nsurrounding warriors parted to let the two pass, Carthoris caught a\r\nfleeting glimpse of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nHis heart leaped in rejoicing. Thuvia of Ptarth still lived!\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that Carthoris restrained the impulse to rush\r\nforward to the side of the Ptarthian princess; but in the end his\r\nbetter judgment prevailed, for in the face of such odds he knew that he\r\nshould have been but throwing away, uselessly, any future opportunity\r\nhe might have to succour her.\r\n\r\nHe saw her dragged to the foot of the rostrum. He saw Hortan Gur\r\naddress her. He could not hear the creature’s words, nor Thuvia’s\r\nreply; but it must have angered the green monster, for Carthoris saw\r\nhim leap toward the prisoner, striking her a cruel blow across the face\r\nwith his metal-banded arm.\r\n\r\nThen the son of John Carter, Jeddak of Jeddaks, Warlord of Barsoom,\r\nwent mad. The old, blood-red haze through which his sire had glared at\r\ncountless foes, floated before his eyes.\r\n\r\nHis half-Earthly muscles, responding quickly to his will, sent him in\r\nenormous leaps and bounds toward the green monster that had struck the\r\nwoman he loved.\r\n\r\nThe Torquasians were not looking in the direction of the forest. All\r\neyes had been upon the figures of the girl and their jeddak, and loud\r\nwas the hideous laughter that rang out in appreciation of the wit of\r\nthe green emperor’s reply to his prisoner’s appeal for liberty.\r\n\r\nCarthoris had covered about half the distance between the forest and\r\nthe green warriors, when a new factor succeeded in still further\r\ndirecting the attention of the latter from him.\r\n\r\nUpon a high tower within the beleaguered city a man appeared. From his\r\nupturned mouth there issued a series of frightful shrieks; uncanny\r\nshrieks that swept, shrill and terrifying, across the city’s walls,\r\nover the heads of the besiegers, and out across the forest to the\r\nuttermost confines of the valley.\r\n\r\nOnce, twice, thrice the fearsome sound smote upon the ears of the\r\nlistening green men and then far, far off across the broad woods came\r\nsharp and clear from the distance an answering shriek.\r\n\r\nIt was but the first. From every point rose similar savage cries, until\r\nthe world seemed to tremble to their reverberations.\r\n\r\nThe green warriors looked nervously this way and that. They knew not\r\nfear, as Earth men may know it; but in the face of the unusual their\r\nwonted self-assurance deserted them.\r\n\r\nAnd then the great gate in the city wall opposite the platform of\r\nHortan Gur swung suddenly wide. From it issued as strange a sight as\r\nCarthoris ever had witnessed, though at the moment he had time to cast\r\nbut a single fleeting glance at the tall bowmen emerging through the\r\nportal behind their long, oval shields; to note their flowing auburn\r\nhair; and to realize that the growling things at their side were fierce\r\nBarsoomian lions.\r\n\r\nThen he was in the midst of the astonished Torquasians. With drawn\r\nlong-sword he was among them, and to Thuvia of Ptarth, whose startled\r\neyes were the first to fall upon him, it seemed that she was looking\r\nupon John Carter himself, so strangely similar to the fighting of the\r\nfather was that of the son.\r\n\r\nEven to the famous fighting smile of the Virginian was the resemblance\r\ntrue. And the sword arm! Ah, the subtleness of it, and the speed!\r\n\r\nAll about was turmoil and confusion. Green warriors were leaping to the\r\nbacks of their restive, squealing thoats. Calots were growling out\r\ntheir savage gutturals, whining to be at the throats of the oncoming\r\nfoemen.\r\n\r\nThar Ban and another by the side of the rostrum had been the first to\r\nnote the coming of Carthoris, and it was with them he battled for\r\npossession of the red girl, while the others hastened to meet the host\r\nadvancing from the beleaguered city.\r\n\r\nCarthoris sought both to defend Thuvia of Ptarth and reach the side of\r\nthe hideous Hortan Gur that he might avenge the blow the creature had\r\nstruck the girl.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in reaching the rostrum, over the dead bodies of two\r\nwarriors who had turned to join Thar Ban and his companion in repulsing\r\nthis adventurous red man, just as Hortan Gur was about to leap from it\r\nto the back of his thoat.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the green warriors turned principally upon the bowmen\r\nadvancing upon them from the city, and upon the savage banths that\r\npaced beside them—cruel beasts of war, infinitely more terrible than\r\ntheir own savage calots.\r\n\r\nAs Carthoris leaped to the rostrum he drew Thuvia up beside him, and\r\nthen he turned upon the departing jeddak with an angry challenge and a\r\nsword thrust.\r\n\r\nAs the Heliumite’s point pricked his green hide, Hortan Gur turned upon\r\nhis adversary with a snarl, but at the same instant two of his\r\nchieftains called to him to hasten, for the charge of the fair-skinned\r\ninhabitants of the city was developing into a more serious matter than\r\nthe Torquasians had anticipated.\r\n\r\nInstead of remaining to battle with the red man, Hortan Gur promised\r\nhim his attention after he had disposed of the presumptuous citizens of\r\nthe walled city, and, leaping astride his thoat, galloped off to meet\r\nthe rapidly advancing bowmen.\r\n\r\nThe other warriors quickly followed their jeddak, leaving Thuvia and\r\nCarthoris alone upon the platform.\r\n\r\nBetween them and the city raged a terrific battle. The fair-skinned\r\nwarriors, armed only with their long bows and a kind of short-handled\r\nwar-axe, were almost helpless beneath the savage mounted green men at\r\nclose quarters; but at a distance their sharp arrows did fully as much\r\nexecution as the radium projectiles of the green men.\r\n\r\nBut if the warriors themselves were outclassed, not so their savage\r\ncompanions, the fierce banths. Scarce had the two lines come together\r\nwhen hundreds of these appalling creatures had leaped among the\r\nTorquasians, dragging warriors from their thoats—dragging down the huge\r\nthoats themselves, and bringing consternation to all before them.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the citizenry, too, was to their advantage, for it\r\nseemed that scarce a warrior fell but his place was taken by a score\r\nmore, in such a constant stream did they pour from the city’s great\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came, what with the ferocity of the banths and the numbers of\r\nthe bowmen, that at last the Torquasians fell back, until presently the\r\nplatform upon which stood Carthoris and Thuvia lay directly in the\r\ncentre of the fight.\r\n\r\nThat neither was struck by a bullet or an arrow seemed a miracle to\r\nboth; but at last the tide had rolled completely past them, so that\r\nthey were alone between the fighters and the city, except for the dying\r\nand the dead, and a score or so of growling banths, less well trained\r\nthan their fellows, who prowled among the corpses seeking meat.\r\n\r\nTo Carthoris the strangest part of the battle had been the terrific\r\ntoll taken by the bowmen with their relatively puny weapons. Nowhere\r\nthat he could see was there a single wounded green man, but the corpses\r\nof their dead lay thick upon the field of battle.\r\n\r\nDeath seemed to follow instantly the slightest pinprick of a bowman’s\r\narrow, nor apparently did one ever miss its goal. There could be but\r\none explanation: the missiles were poison-tipped.\r\n\r\nPresently the sounds of conflict died in the distant forest. Quiet\r\nreigned, broken only by the growling of the devouring banths. Carthoris\r\nturned toward Thuvia of Ptarth. As yet neither had spoken.\r\n\r\n“Where are we, Thuvia?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him questioningly. His very presence had seemed to\r\nproclaim a guilty knowledge of her abduction. How else might he have\r\nknown the destination of the flier that brought her!\r\n\r\n“Who should know better than the Prince of Helium?” she asked in\r\nreturn. “Did he not come hither of his own free will?”\r\n\r\n“From Aaanthor I came voluntarily upon the trail of the green man who\r\nhad stolen you, Thuvia,” he replied; “but from the time I left Helium\r\nuntil I awoke above Aaanthor I thought myself bound for Ptarth.\r\n\r\n“It had been intimated that I had guilty knowledge of your abduction,”\r\nhe explained simply, “and I was hastening to the jeddak, your father,\r\nto convince him of the falsity of the charge, and to give my service to\r\nyour recovery. Before I left Helium some one tampered with my compass,\r\nso that it bore me to Aaanthor instead of to Ptarth. That is all. You\r\nbelieve me?”\r\n\r\n“But the warriors who stole me from the garden!” she exclaimed. “After\r\nwe arrived at Aaanthor they wore the metal of the Prince of Helium.\r\nWhen they took me they were trapped in Dusarian harness. There seemed\r\nbut a single explanation. Whoever dared the outrage wished to put the\r\nonus upon another, should he be detected in the act; but once safely\r\naway from Ptarth he felt safe in having his minions return to their own\r\nharness.”\r\n\r\n“You believe that I did this thing, Thuvia?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Carthoris,” she replied sadly, “I did not wish to believe it; but\r\nwhen everything pointed to you—even then I would not believe it.”\r\n\r\n“I did not do it, Thuvia,” he said. “But let me be entirely honest with\r\nyou. As much as I love your father, as much as I respect Kulan Tith, to\r\nwhom you are betrothed, as well as I know the frightful consequences\r\nthat must have followed such an act of mine, hurling into war, as it\r\nwould, three of the greatest nations of Barsoom—yet, notwithstanding\r\nall this, I should not have hesitated to take you thus, Thuvia of\r\nPtarth, had you even hinted that it would not have displeased _you_.\r\n\r\n“But you did nothing of the kind, and so I am here, not in my own\r\nservice, but in yours, and in the service of the man to whom you are\r\npromised, to save you for him, if it lies within the power of man to do\r\nso,” he concluded, almost bitterly.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth looked into his face for several moments. Her breast\r\nwas rising and falling as though to some resistless emotion. She half\r\ntook a step toward him. Her lips parted as though to speak—swiftly and\r\nimpetuously.\r\n\r\nAnd then she conquered whatever had moved her.\r\n\r\n“The future acts of the Prince of Helium,” she said coldly, “must\r\nconstitute the proof of his past honesty of purpose.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris was hurt by the girl’s tone, as much as by the doubt as to\r\nhis integrity which her words implied.\r\n\r\nHe had half hoped that she might hint that his love would be\r\nacceptable—certainly there was due him at least a little gratitude for\r\nhis recent acts in her behalf; but the best he received was cold\r\nskepticism.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Helium shrugged his broad shoulders. The girl noted it,\r\nand the little smile that touched his lips, so that it became her turn\r\nto be hurt.\r\n\r\nOf course she had not meant to hurt him. He might have known that after\r\nwhat he had said she could not do anything to encourage him! But he\r\nneed not have made his indifference quite so palpable. The men of\r\nHelium were noted for their gallantry—not for boorishness. Possibly it\r\nwas the Earth blood that flowed in his veins.\r\n\r\nHow could she know that the shrug was but Carthoris’ way of attempting,\r\nby physical effort, to cast blighting sorrow from his heart, or that\r\nthe smile upon his lips was the fighting smile of his father with which\r\nthe son gave outward evidence of the determination he had reached to\r\nsubmerge his own great love in his efforts to save Thuvia of Ptarth for\r\nanother, because he believed that she loved this other!\r\n\r\nHe reverted to his original question.\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” he asked. “I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” replied the girl. “Those who stole me from Ptarth spoke among\r\nthemselves of Aaanthor, so that I thought it possible that the ancient\r\ncity to which they took me was that famous ruin; but where we may be\r\nnow I have no idea.”\r\n\r\n“When the bowmen return we shall doubtless learn all that there is to\r\nknow,” said Carthoris. “Let us hope that they prove friendly. What race\r\nmay they be? Only in the most ancient of our legends and in the mural\r\npaintings of the deserted cities of the dead sea-bottoms are depicted\r\nsuch a race of auburn-haired, fair-skinned people. Can it be that we\r\nhave stumbled upon a surviving city of the past which all Barsoom\r\nbelieves buried beneath the ages?”\r\n\r\nThuvia was looking toward the forest into which the green men and the\r\npursuing bowmen had disappeared. From a great distance came the hideous\r\ncries of banths, and an occasional shot.\r\n\r\n“It is strange that they do not return,” said the girl.\r\n\r\n“One would expect to see the wounded limping or being carried back to\r\nthe city,” replied Carthoris, with a puzzled frown. “But how about the\r\nwounded nearer the city? Have they carried them within?”\r\n\r\nBoth turned their eyes toward the field between them and the walled\r\ncity, where the fighting had been most furious.\r\n\r\nThere were the banths, still growling about their hideous feast.\r\n\r\nCarthoris looked at Thuvia in astonishment. Then he pointed toward the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n“Where are they?” he whispered. “_What has become of their dead and\r\nwounded?_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE JEDDAK OF LOTHAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl looked her incredulity.\r\n\r\n“They lay in piles,” she murmured. “There were thousands of them but a\r\nminute ago.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued Carthoris, “there remain but the banths and the\r\ncarcasses of the green men.”\r\n\r\n“They must have sent forth and carried the dead bowmen away while we\r\nwere talking,” said the girl.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible!” replied Carthoris. “Thousands of dead lay there\r\nupon the field but a moment since. It would have required many hours to\r\nhave removed them. The thing is uncanny.”\r\n\r\n“I had hoped,” said Thuvia, “that we might find an asylum with these\r\nfair-skinned people. Notwithstanding their valour upon the field of\r\nbattle, they did not strike me as a ferocious or warlike people. I had\r\nbeen about to suggest that we seek entrance to the city, but now I\r\nscarce know if I care to venture among people whose dead vanish into\r\nthin air.”\r\n\r\n“Let us chance it,” replied Carthoris. “We can be no worse off within\r\ntheir walls than without. Here we may fall prey to the banths or the no\r\nless fierce Torquasians. There, at least, we shall find beings moulded\r\nafter our own images.\r\n\r\n“All that causes me to hesitate,” he added, “is the danger of taking\r\nyou past so many banths. A single sword would scarce prevail were even\r\na couple of them to charge simultaneously.”\r\n\r\n“Do not fear on that score,” replied the girl, smiling. “The banths\r\nwill not harm us.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she descended from the platform, and with Carthoris at her\r\nside stepped fearlessly out upon the bloody field in the direction of\r\nthe walled city of mystery.\r\n\r\nThey had advanced but a short distance when a banth, looking up from\r\nits gory feast, descried them. With an angry roar the beast walked\r\nquickly in their direction, and at the sound of its voice a score of\r\nothers followed its example.\r\n\r\nCarthoris drew his long-sword. The girl stole a quick glance at his\r\nface. She saw the smile upon his lips, and it was as wine to sick\r\nnerves; for even upon warlike Barsoom where all men are brave, woman\r\nreacts quickly to quiet indifference to danger—to dare-deviltry that is\r\nwithout bombast.\r\n\r\n“You may return your sword,” she said. “I told you that the banths\r\nwould not harm us. Look!” and as she spoke she stepped quickly toward\r\nthe nearest animal.\r\n\r\nCarthoris would have leaped after her to protect her, but with a\r\ngesture she motioned him back. He heard her calling to the banths in a\r\nlow, singsong voice that was half purr.\r\n\r\nInstantly the great heads went up and all the wicked eyes were riveted\r\nupon the figure of the girl. Then, stealthily, they commenced moving\r\ntoward her. She had stopped now and was standing waiting them.\r\n\r\nOne, closer to her than the others, hesitated. She spoke to him\r\nimperiously, as a master might speak to a refractory hound.\r\n\r\nThe great carnivore let its head droop, and with tail between its legs\r\ncame slinking to the girl’s feet, and after it came the others until\r\nshe was entirely surrounded by the savage man-eaters.\r\n\r\nTurning she led them to where Carthoris stood. They growled a little as\r\nthey neared the man, but a few sharp words of command put them in their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n“How do you do it?” exclaimed Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Your father once asked me that same question in the galleries of the\r\nGolden Cliffs within the Otz Mountains, beneath the temples of the\r\ntherns. I could not answer him, nor can I answer you. I do not know\r\nwhence comes my power over them, but ever since the day that Sator\r\nThrog threw me among them in the banth pit of the Holy Therns, and the\r\ngreat creatures fawned upon instead of devouring me, I ever have had\r\nthe same strange power over them. They come at my call and do my\r\nbidding, even as the faithful Woola does the bidding of your mighty\r\nsire.”\r\n\r\nWith a word the girl dispersed the fierce pack. Roaring, they returned\r\nto their interrupted feast, while Carthoris and Thuvia passed among\r\nthem toward the walled city.\r\n\r\nAs they advanced the man looked with wonder upon the dead bodies of\r\nthose of the green men that had not been devoured or mauled by the\r\nbanths.\r\n\r\nHe called the girl’s attention to them. No arrows protruded from the\r\ngreat carcasses. Nowhere upon any of them was the sign of mortal wound,\r\nnor even slightest scratch or abrasion.\r\n\r\nBefore the bowmen’s dead had disappeared the corpses of the Torquasians\r\nhad bristled with the deadly arrows of their foes. Where had the\r\nslender messengers of death departed? What unseen hand had plucked them\r\nfrom the bodies of the slain?\r\n\r\nDespite himself Carthoris could scarce repress a shudder of\r\napprehension as he glanced toward the silent city before them. No\r\nlonger was sign of life visible upon wall or roof top. All was\r\nquiet—brooding, ominous quiet.\r\n\r\nYet he was sure that eyes watched them from somewhere behind that blank\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Thuvia. She was advancing with wide eyes fixed upon the\r\ncity gate. He looked in the direction of her gaze, but saw nothing.\r\n\r\nHis gaze upon her seemed to arouse her as from a lethargy. She glanced\r\nup at him, a quick, brave smile touching her lips, and then, as though\r\nthe act was involuntary, she came close to his side and placed one of\r\nher hands in his.\r\n\r\nHe guessed that something within her that was beyond her conscious\r\ncontrol was appealing to him for protection. He threw an arm about her,\r\nand thus they crossed the field. She did not draw away from him. It is\r\ndoubtful that she realized that his arm was there, so engrossed was she\r\nin the mystery of the strange city before them.\r\n\r\nThey stopped before the gate. It was a mighty thing. From its\r\nconstruction Carthoris could but dimly speculate upon its unthinkable\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nIt was circular, closing a circular aperture, and the Heliumite knew\r\nfrom his study of ancient Barsoomian architecture that it rolled to one\r\nside, like a huge wheel, into an aperture in the wall.\r\n\r\nEven such world-old cities as ancient Aaanthor were as yet undreamed of\r\nwhen the races lived that built such gates as these.\r\n\r\nAs he stood speculating upon the identity of this forgotten city, a\r\nvoice spoke to them from above. Both looked up. There, leaning over the\r\nedge of the high wall, was a man.\r\n\r\nHis hair was auburn, his skin fair—fairer even than that of John\r\nCarter, the Virginian. His forehead was high, his eyes large and\r\nintelligent.\r\n\r\nThe language that he used was intelligible to the two below, yet there\r\nwas a marked difference between it and their Barsoomian tongue.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked. “And what do you here before the gate of\r\nLothar?”\r\n\r\n“We are friends,” replied Carthoris. “This be the princess, Thuvia of\r\nPtarth, who was captured by the Torquasian horde. I am Carthoris of\r\nHelium, Prince of the house of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, and son\r\nof John Carter, Warlord of Mars, and of his wife, Dejah Thoris.”\r\n\r\n“‘Ptarth’?” repeated the man. “‘Helium’?” He shook his head. “I never\r\nhave heard of these places, nor did I know that there dwelt upon\r\nBarsoom a race of thy strange colour. Where may these cities lie, of\r\nwhich you speak? From our loftiest tower we have never seen another\r\ncity than Lothar.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris pointed toward the north-east.\r\n\r\n“In that direction lie Helium and Ptarth,” he said. “Helium is over\r\neight thousand haads from Lothar, while Ptarth lies nine thousand five\r\nhundred haads north-east of Helium.”[1]\r\n\r\nStill the man shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I know of nothing beyond the Lotharian hills,” he said. “Naught may\r\nlive there beside the hideous green hordes of Torquas. They have\r\nconquered all Barsoom except this single valley and the city of Lothar.\r\nHere we have defied them for countless ages, though periodically they\r\nrenew their attempts to destroy us. From whence you come I cannot guess\r\nunless you be descended from the slaves the Torquasians captured in\r\nearly times when they reduced the outer world to their vassalage; but\r\nwe had heard that they destroyed all other races but their own.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris tried to explain that the Torquasians ruled but a relatively\r\ntiny part of the surface of Barsoom, and even this only because their\r\ndomain held nothing to attract the red race; but the Lotharian could\r\nnot seem to conceive of anything beyond the valley of Lothar other than\r\na trackless waste peopled by the ferocious green hordes of Torquas.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable parleying he consented to admit them to the city,\r\nand a moment later the wheel-like gate rolled back within its niche,\r\nand Thuvia and Carthoris entered the city of Lothar.\r\n\r\nAll about them were evidences of fabulous wealth. The facades of the\r\nbuildings fronting upon the avenue within the wall were richly carven,\r\nand about the windows and doors were ofttimes set foot-wide borders of\r\nprecious stones, intricate mosaics, or tablets of beaten gold bearing\r\nbas-reliefs depicting what may have been bits of the history of this\r\nforgotten people.\r\n\r\nHe with whom they had conversed across the wall was in the avenue to\r\nreceive them. About him were a hundred or more men of the same race.\r\nAll were clothed in flowing robes and all were beardless.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude was more of fearful suspicion than antagonism. They\r\nfollowed the new-comers with their eyes; but spoke no word to them.\r\n\r\nCarthoris could not but notice the fact that though the city had been\r\nbut a short time before surrounded by a horde of bloodthirsty demons\r\nyet none of the citizens appeared to be armed, nor was there sign of\r\nsoldiery about.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if all the fighting men had sallied forth in one supreme\r\neffort to rout the foe, leaving the city all unguarded. He asked their\r\nhost.\r\n\r\nThe man smiled.\r\n\r\n“No creature other than a score or so of our sacred banths has left\r\nLothar to-day,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“But the soldiers—the bowmen!” exclaimed Carthoris. “We saw thousands\r\nemerge from this very gate, overwhelming the hordes of Torquas and\r\nputting them to rout with their deadly arrows and their fierce banths.”\r\n\r\nStill the man smiled his knowing smile.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he cried, and pointed down a broad avenue before him.\r\n\r\nCarthoris and Thuvia followed the direction indicated, and there,\r\nmarching bravely in the sunlight, they saw advancing toward them a\r\ngreat army of bowmen.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Thuvia. “They have returned through another gate, or\r\nperchance these be the troops that remained to defend the city?”\r\n\r\nAgain the fellow smiled his uncanny smile.\r\n\r\n“There are no soldiers in Lothar,” he said. “Look!”\r\n\r\nBoth Carthoris and Thuvia had turned toward him while he spoke, and now\r\nas they turned back again toward the advancing regiments their eyes\r\nwent wide in astonishment, for the broad avenue before them was as\r\ndeserted as the tomb.\r\n\r\n“And those who marched out upon the hordes to-day?” whispered\r\nCarthoris. “They, too, were unreal?”\r\n\r\nThe man nodded.\r\n\r\n“But their arrows slew the green warriors,” insisted Thuvia.\r\n\r\n“Let us go before Tario,” replied the Lotharian. “He will tell you that\r\nwhich he deems it best you know. I might tell you too much.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Tario?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Jeddak of Lothar,” replied the guide, leading them up the broad avenue\r\ndown which they had but a moment since seen the phantom army marching.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour they walked along lovely avenues between the most\r\ngorgeous buildings that the two had ever seen. Few people were in\r\nevidence. Carthoris could not but note the deserted appearance of the\r\nmighty city.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to the royal palace. Carthoris saw it from a\r\ndistance, and guessing the nature of the magnificent pile wondered that\r\neven here there should be so little sign of activity and life.\r\n\r\nNot even a single guard was visible before the great entrance gate, nor\r\nin the gardens beyond, into which he could see, was there sign of the\r\nmyriad life that pulses within the precincts of the royal estates of\r\nthe red jeddaks.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said their guide, “is the palace of Tario.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Carthoris again let his gaze rest upon the wondrous palace.\r\nWith a startled exclamation he rubbed his eyes and looked again. No! He\r\ncould not be mistaken. Before the massive gate stood a score of\r\nsentries. Within, the avenue leading to the main building was lined on\r\neither side by ranks of bowmen. The gardens were dotted with officers\r\nand soldiers moving quickly to and fro, as though bent upon the duties\r\nof the minute.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of people were these who could conjure an army out of thin\r\nair? He glanced toward Thuvia. She, too, evidently had witnessed the\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nWith a little shudder she pressed more closely toward him.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it?” she whispered. “It is most uncanny.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot account for it,” replied Carthoris, “unless we have gone\r\nmad.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris turned quickly toward the Lotharian. The fellow was smiling\r\nbroadly.\r\n\r\n“I thought that you just said that there were no soldiers in Lothar,”\r\nsaid the Heliumite, with a gesture toward the guardsmen. “What are\r\nthese?”\r\n\r\n“Ask Tario,” replied the other. “We shall soon be before him.”\r\n\r\nNor was it long before they entered a lofty chamber at one end of which\r\na man reclined upon a rich couch that stood upon a high dais.\r\n\r\nAs the trio approached, the man turned dreamy eyes sleepily upon them.\r\nTwenty feet from the dais their conductor halted, and, whispering to\r\nThuvia and Carthoris to follow his example, threw himself headlong to\r\nthe floor. Then rising to hands and knees, he commenced crawling toward\r\nthe foot of the throne, swinging his head to and fro and wiggling his\r\nbody as you have seen a hound do when approaching its master.\r\n\r\nThuvia glanced quickly toward Carthoris. He was standing erect, with\r\nhigh-held head and arms folded across his broad chest. A haughty smile\r\ncurved his lips.\r\n\r\nThe man upon the dais was eyeing him intently, and Carthoris of Helium\r\nwas looking straight in the other’s face.\r\n\r\n“Who be these, Jav?” asked the man of him who crawled upon his belly\r\nalong the floor.\r\n\r\n“O Tario, most glorious Jeddak,” replied Jav, “these be strangers who\r\ncame with the hordes of Torquas to our gates, saying that they were\r\nprisoners of the green men. They tell strange tales of cities far\r\nbeyond Lothar.”\r\n\r\n“Arise, Jav,” commanded Tario, “and ask these two why they show not to\r\nTario the respect that is his due.”\r\n\r\nJav arose and faced the strangers. At sight of their erect positions\r\nhis face went livid. He leaped toward them.\r\n\r\n“Creatures!” he screamed. “Down! Down upon your bellies before the last\r\nof the jeddaks of Barsoom!”\r\n\r\n [1] On Barsoom the _ad_ is the basis of linear measurement. It is the\r\n equivalent of an Earthly foot, measuring about 11.694 Earth inches. As\r\n has been my custom in the past, I have generally translated Barsoomian\r\n symbols of time, distance, etc., into their Earthly equivalent, as\r\n being more easily understood by Earth readers. For those of a more\r\n studious turn of mind it may be interesting to know the Martian table\r\n of linear measurement, and so I give it here:\r\n\r\n      10 sofads = 1 ad\r\n     200 ads    = 1 haad\r\n     100 haads  = 1 karad\r\n     360 karads = 1 circumference of Mars at equator.\r\n\r\nA haad, or Barsoomian mile, contains about 2,339 Earth feet. A karad is\r\none degree. A sofad about 1.17 Earth inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE PHANTOM BOWMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Jav leaped toward him Carthoris laid his hand upon the hilt of his\r\nlong-sword. The Lotharian halted. The great apartment was empty save\r\nfor the four at the dais, yet as Jav stepped back from the menace of\r\nthe Heliumite’s threatening attitude the latter found himself\r\nsurrounded by a score of bowmen.\r\n\r\nFrom whence had they sprung? Both Carthoris and Thuvia looked their\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nNow the former’s sword leaped from its scabbard, and at the same\r\ninstant the bowmen drew back their slim shafts.\r\n\r\nTario had half raised himself upon one elbow. For the first time he saw\r\nthe full figure of Thuvia, who had been concealed behind the person of\r\nCarthoris.\r\n\r\n“Enough!” cried the jeddak, raising a protesting hand, but at that very\r\ninstant the sword of the Heliumite cut viciously at its nearest\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nAs the keen edge reached its goal Carthoris let the point fall to the\r\nfloor, as with wide eyes he stepped backward in consternation, throwing\r\nthe back of his left hand across his brow. His steel had cut but empty\r\nair—his antagonist had vanished—there were no bowmen in the room!\r\n\r\n“It is evident that these are strangers,” said Tario to Jav. “Let us\r\nfirst determine that they knowingly affronted us before we take\r\nmeasures for punishment.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Carthoris, but ever his gaze wandered to the perfect\r\nlines of Thuvia’s glorious figure, which the harness of a Barsoomian\r\nprincess accentuated rather than concealed.\r\n\r\n“Who are you,” he asked, “who knows not the etiquette of the court of\r\nthe last of jeddaks?”\r\n\r\n“I am Carthoris, Prince of Helium,” replied the Heliumite. “And this is\r\nThuvia, Princess of Ptarth. In the courts of our fathers men do not\r\nprostrate themselves before royalty. Not since the First Born tore\r\ntheir immortal goddess limb from limb have men crawled upon their\r\nbellies to any throne upon Barsoom. Now think you that the daughter of\r\none mighty jeddak and the son of another would so humiliate\r\nthemselves?”\r\n\r\nTario looked at Carthoris for a long time. At last he spoke.\r\n\r\n“There is no other jeddak upon Barsoom than Tario,” he said. “There is\r\nno other race than that of Lothar, unless the hordes of Torquas may be\r\ndignified by such an appellation. Lotharians are white; your skins are\r\nred. There are no women left upon Barsoom. Your companion is a woman.”\r\n\r\nHe half rose from the couch, leaning far forward and pointing an\r\naccusing finger at Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“You are a lie!” he shrieked. “You are both lies, and you dare to come\r\nbefore Tario, last and mightiest of the jeddaks of Barsoom, and assert\r\nyour reality. Some one shall pay well for this, Jav, and unless I\r\nmistake it is yourself who has dared thus flippantly to trifle with the\r\ngood nature of your jeddak.\r\n\r\n“Remove the man. Leave the woman. We shall see if both be lies. And\r\nlater, Jav, you shall suffer for your temerity. There be few of us\r\nleft, but—Komal must be fed. Go!”\r\n\r\nCarthoris could see that Jav trembled as he prostrated himself once\r\nmore before his ruler, and then, rising, turned toward the Prince of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he said.\r\n\r\n“And leave the Princess of Ptarth here alone?” cried Carthoris.\r\n\r\nJav brushed closely past him, whispering:\r\n\r\n“Follow me—he cannot harm her, except to kill; and that he can do\r\nwhether you remain or not. We had best go now—trust me.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris did not understand, but something in the urgency of the\r\nother’s tone assured him, and so he turned away, but not without a\r\nglance toward Thuvia in which he attempted to make her understand that\r\nit was in her own interest that he left her.\r\n\r\nFor answer she turned her back full upon him, but not without first\r\nthrowing him such a look of contempt that brought the scarlet to his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nThen he hesitated, but Jav seized him by the wrist.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he whispered. “Or he will have the bowmen upon you, and this\r\ntime there will be no escape. Did you not see how futile is your steel\r\nagainst thin air!”\r\n\r\nCarthoris turned unwillingly to follow. As the two left the room he\r\nturned to his companion.\r\n\r\n“If I may not kill thin air,” he asked, “how, then, shall I fear that\r\nthin air may kill me?”\r\n\r\n“You saw the Torquasians fall before the bowmen?” asked Jav.\r\n\r\nCarthoris nodded.\r\n\r\n“So would you fall before them, and without one single chance for\r\nself-defence or revenge.”\r\n\r\nAs they talked Jav led Carthoris to a small room in one of the numerous\r\ntowers of the palace. Here were couches, and Jav bid the Heliumite be\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes the Lotharian eyed his prisoner, for such Carthoris\r\nnow realized himself to be.\r\n\r\n“I am half convinced that you are real,” he said at last.\r\n\r\nCarthoris laughed.\r\n\r\n“Of course I am real,” he said. “What caused you to doubt it? Can you\r\nnot see me, feel me?”\r\n\r\n“So may I see and feel the bowmen,” replied Jav, “and yet we all know\r\nthat they, at least, are not real.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris showed by the expression of his face his puzzlement at each\r\nnew reference to the mysterious bowmen—the vanishing soldiery of\r\nLothar.\r\n\r\n“What, then, may they be?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“You really do not know?” asked Jav.\r\n\r\nCarthoris shook his head negatively.\r\n\r\n“I can almost believe that you have told us the truth and that you are\r\nreally from another part of Barsoom, or from another world. But tell\r\nme, in your own country have you no bowmen to strike terror to the\r\nhearts of the green hordesmen as they slay in company with the fierce\r\nbanths of war?”\r\n\r\n“We have soldiers,” replied Carthoris. “We of the red race are all\r\nsoldiers, but we have no bowmen to defend us, such as yours. We defend\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“You go out and get killed by your enemies!” cried Jav incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Carthoris. “How do the Lotharians?”\r\n\r\n“You have seen,” replied the other. “We send out our deathless\r\narchers—deathless because they are lifeless, existing only in the\r\nimaginations of our enemies. It is really our giant minds that defend\r\nus, sending out legions of imaginary warriors to materialize before the\r\nmind’s eye of the foe.\r\n\r\n“They see them—they see their bows drawn back—they see their slender\r\narrows speed with unerring precision toward their hearts. And they\r\ndie—killed by the power of suggestion.”\r\n\r\n“But the archers that are slain?” exclaimed Carthoris. “You call them\r\ndeathless, and yet I saw their dead bodies piled high upon the\r\nbattlefield. How may that be?”\r\n\r\n“It is but to lend reality to the scene,” replied Jav. “We picture many\r\nof our own defenders killed that the Torquasians may not guess that\r\nthere are really no flesh and blood creatures opposing them.\r\n\r\n“Once that truth became implanted in their minds, it is the theory of\r\nmany of us, no longer would they fall prey to the suggestion of the\r\ndeadly arrows, for greater would be the suggestion of the truth, and\r\nthe more powerful suggestion would prevail—it is law.”\r\n\r\n“And the banths?” questioned Carthoris. “They, too, were but creatures\r\nof suggestion?”\r\n\r\n“Some of them were real,” replied Jav. “Those that accompanied the\r\narchers in pursuit of the Torquasians were unreal. Like the archers,\r\nthey never returned, but, having served their purpose, vanished with\r\nthe bowmen when the rout of the enemy was assured.\r\n\r\n“Those that remained about the field were real. Those we loosed as\r\nscavengers to devour the bodies of the dead of Torquas. This thing is\r\ndemanded by the realists among us. I am a realist. Tario is an\r\netherealist.\r\n\r\n“The etherealists maintain that there is no such thing as matter—that\r\nall is mind. They say that none of us exists, except in the imagination\r\nof his fellows, other than as an intangible, invisible mentality.\r\n\r\n“According to Tario, it is but necessary that we all unite in imagining\r\nthat there are no dead Torquasians beneath our walls, and there will be\r\nnone, nor any need of scavenging banths.”\r\n\r\n“You, then, do not hold Tario’s beliefs?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“In part only,” replied the Lotharian. “I believe, in fact I know, that\r\nthere are some truly ethereal creatures. Tario is one, I am convinced.\r\nHe has no existence except in the imaginations of his people.\r\n\r\n“Of course, it is the contention of all us realists that all\r\netherealists are but figments of the imagination. They contend that no\r\nfood is necessary, nor do they eat; but any one of the most rudimentary\r\nintelligence must realize that food is a necessity to creatures having\r\nactual existence.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed Carthoris, “not having eaten to-day I can readily agree\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, pardon me,” exclaimed Jav. “Pray be seated and satisfy your\r\nhunger,” and with a wave of his hand he indicated a bountifully laden\r\ntable that had not been there an instant before he spoke. Of that\r\nCarthoris was positive, for he had searched the room diligently with\r\nhis eyes several times.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” continued Jav, “that you did not fall into the hands of\r\nan etherealist. Then, indeed, would you have gone hungry.”\r\n\r\n“But,” exclaimed Carthoris, “this is not real food—it was not here an\r\ninstant since, and real food does not materialize out of thin air.”\r\n\r\nJav looked hurt.\r\n\r\n“There is no real food or water in Lothar,” he said; “nor has there\r\nbeen for countless ages. Upon such as you now see before you have we\r\nexisted since the dawn of history. Upon such, then, may you exist.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought you were a realist,” exclaimed Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” cried Jav, “what more realistic than this bounteous feast? It\r\nis just here that we differ most from the etherealists. They claim that\r\nit is unnecessary to imagine food; but we have found that for the\r\nmaintenance of life we must thrice daily sit down to hearty meals.\r\n\r\n“The food that one eats is supposed to undergo certain chemical changes\r\nduring the process of digestion and assimilation, the result, of\r\ncourse, being the rebuilding of wasted tissue.\r\n\r\n“Now we all know that mind is all, though we may differ in the\r\ninterpretation of its various manifestations. Tario maintains that\r\nthere is no such thing as substance, all being created from the\r\nsubstanceless matter of the brain.\r\n\r\n“We realists, however, know better. We know that mind has the power to\r\nmaintain substance even though it may not be able to create\r\nsubstance—the latter is still an open question. And so we know that in\r\norder to maintain our physical bodies we must cause all our organs\r\nproperly to function.\r\n\r\n“This we accomplish by materializing food-thoughts, and by partaking of\r\nthe food thus created. We chew, we swallow, we digest. All our organs\r\nfunction precisely as if we had partaken of material food. And what is\r\nthe result? What must be the result? The chemical changes take place\r\nthrough both direct and indirect suggestion, and we live and thrive.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris eyed the food before him. It seemed real enough. He lifted a\r\nmorsel to his lips. There was substance indeed. And flavour as well.\r\nYes, even his palate was deceived.\r\n\r\nJav watched him, smiling, as he ate.\r\n\r\n“Is it not entirely satisfying?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I must admit that it is,” replied Carthoris. “But tell me, how does\r\nTario live, and the other etherealists who maintain that food is\r\nunnecessary?”\r\n\r\nJav scratched his head.\r\n\r\n“That is a question we often discuss,” he replied. “It is the strongest\r\nevidence we have of the non-existence of the etherealists; but who may\r\nknow other than Komal?”\r\n\r\n“Who is Komal?” asked Carthoris. “I heard your jeddak speak of him.”\r\n\r\nJav bent low toward the ear of the Heliumite, looking fearfully about\r\nbefore he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Komal is the essence,” he whispered. “Even the etherealists admit that\r\nmind itself must have substance in order to transmit to imaginings the\r\nappearance of substance. For if there really was no such thing as\r\nsubstance it could not be suggested—what never has been cannot be\r\nimagined. Do you follow me?”\r\n\r\n“I am groping,” replied Carthoris dryly.\r\n\r\n“So the essence must be substance,” continued Jav. “Komal is the\r\nessence of the All, as it were. He is maintained by substance. He eats.\r\nHe eats the real. To be explicit, he eats the realists. That is Tario’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“He says that inasmuch as we maintain that we alone are real we should,\r\nto be consistent, admit that we alone are proper food for Komal.\r\nSometimes, as to-day, we find other food for him. He is very fond of\r\nTorquasians.”\r\n\r\n“And Komal is a man?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“He is All, I told you,” replied Jav. “I know not how to explain him in\r\nwords that you will understand. He is the beginning and the end. All\r\nlife emanates from Komal, since the substance which feeds the brain\r\nwith imaginings radiates from the body of Komal.\r\n\r\n“Should Komal cease to eat, all life upon Barsoom would cease to be. He\r\ncannot die, but he might cease to eat, and, thus, to radiate.”\r\n\r\n“And he feeds upon the men and women of your belief?” cried Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Women!” exclaimed Jav. “There are no women in Lothar. The last of the\r\nLotharian females perished ages since, upon that cruel and terrible\r\njourney across the muddy plains that fringed the half-dried seas, when\r\nthe green hordes scourged us across the world to this our last\r\nhiding-place—our impregnable fortress of Lothar.\r\n\r\n“Scarce twenty thousand men of all the countless millions of our race\r\nlived to reach Lothar. Among us were no women and no children. All\r\nthese had perished by the way.\r\n\r\n“As time went on, we, too, were dying and the race fast approaching\r\nextinction, when the Great Truth was revealed to us, that mind is all.\r\nMany more died before we perfected our powers, but at last we were able\r\nto defy death when we fully understood that death was merely a state of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“Then came the creation of mind-people, or rather the materialization\r\nof imaginings. We first put these to practical use when the Torquasians\r\ndiscovered our retreat, and fortunate for us it was that it required\r\nages of search upon their part before they found the single tiny\r\nentrance to the valley of Lothar.\r\n\r\n“That day we threw our first bowmen against them. The intention was\r\npurely to frighten them away by the vast numbers of bowmen which we\r\ncould muster upon our walls. All Lothar bristled with the bows and\r\narrows of our ethereal host.\r\n\r\n“But the Torquasians did not frighten. They are lower than the\r\nbeasts—they know no fear. They rushed upon our walls, and standing upon\r\nthe shoulders of others they built human approaches to the wall tops,\r\nand were on the very point of surging in upon us and overwhelming us.\r\n\r\n“Not an arrow had been discharged by our bowmen—we did but cause them\r\nto run to and fro along the wall top, screaming taunts and threats at\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\n“Presently I thought to attempt the thing—_the great thing_. I centred\r\nall my mighty intellect upon the bowmen of my own creation—each of us\r\nproduces and directs as many bowmen as his mentality and imagination is\r\ncapable of.\r\n\r\n“I caused them to fit arrows to their bows for the first time. I made\r\nthem take aim at the hearts of the green men. I made the green men see\r\nall this, and then I made them see the arrows fly, and I made them\r\nthink that the points pierced their hearts.\r\n\r\n“It was all that was necessary. By hundreds they toppled from our\r\nwalls, and when my fellows saw what I had done they were quick to\r\nfollow my example, so that presently the hordes of Torquas had\r\nretreated beyond the range of our arrows.\r\n\r\n“We might have killed them at any distance, but one rule of war we have\r\nmaintained from the first—the rule of realism. We do nothing, or rather\r\nwe cause our bowmen to do nothing within sight of the enemy that is\r\nbeyond the understanding of the foe. Otherwise they might guess the\r\ntruth, and that would be the end of us.\r\n\r\n“But after the Torquasians had retreated beyond bowshot, they turned\r\nupon us with their terrible rifles, and by constant popping at us made\r\nlife miserable within our walls.\r\n\r\n“So then I bethought the scheme to hurl our bowmen through the gates\r\nupon them. You have seen this day how well it works. For ages they have\r\ncome down upon us at intervals, but always with the same results.”\r\n\r\n“And all this is due to your intellect, Jav?” asked Carthoris. “I\r\nshould think that you would be high in the councils of your people.”\r\n\r\n“I am,” replied Jav, proudly. “I am next to Tario.”\r\n\r\n“But why, then, your cringing manner of approaching the throne?”\r\n\r\n“Tario demands it. He is jealous of me. He only awaits the slightest\r\nexcuse to feed me to Komal. He fears that I may some day usurp his\r\npower.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris suddenly sprang from the table.\r\n\r\n“Jav!” he exclaimed. “I am a beast! Here I have been eating my fill,\r\nwhile the Princess of Ptarth may perchance be still without food. Let\r\nus return and find some means of furnishing her with nourishment.”\r\n\r\nThe Lotharian shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Tario would not permit it,” he said. “He will, doubtless, make an\r\netherealist of her.”\r\n\r\n“But I must go to her,” insisted Carthoris. “You say that there are no\r\nwomen in Lothar. Then she must be among men, and if this be so I intend\r\nto be near where I may defend her if the need arises.”\r\n\r\n“Tario will have his way,” insisted Jav. “He sent you away and you may\r\nnot return until he sends for you.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall go without waiting to be sent for.”\r\n\r\n“Do not forget the bowmen,” cautioned Jav.\r\n\r\n“I do not forget them,” replied Carthoris, but he did not tell Jav that\r\nhe remembered something else that the Lotharian had let drop—something\r\nthat was but a conjecture, possibly, and yet one well worth pinning a\r\nforlorn hope to, should necessity arise.\r\n\r\nCarthoris started to leave the room. Jav stepped before him, barring\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n“I have learned to like you, red man,” he said; “but do not forget that\r\nTario is still my jeddak, and that Tario has commanded that you remain\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris was about to reply, when there came faintly to the ears of\r\nboth a woman’s cry for help.\r\n\r\nWith a sweep of his arm the Prince of Helium brushed the Lotharian\r\naside, and with drawn sword sprang into the corridor without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE HALL OF DOOM\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Thuvia of Ptarth saw Carthoris depart from the presence of Tario,\r\nleaving her alone with the man, a sudden qualm of terror seized her.\r\n\r\nThere was an air of mystery pervading the stately chamber. Its\r\nfurnishings and appointments bespoke wealth and culture, and carried\r\nthe suggestion that the room was often the scene of royal functions\r\nwhich filled it to its capacity.\r\n\r\nAnd yet nowhere about her, in antechamber or corridor, was there sign\r\nof any other being than herself and the recumbent figure of Tario, the\r\njeddak, who watched her through half-closed eyes from the gorgeous\r\ntrappings of his regal couch.\r\n\r\nFor a time after the departure of Jav and Carthoris the man eyed her\r\nintently. Then he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Come nearer,” he said, and, as she approached: “Whose creature are\r\nyou? Who has dared materialize his imaginings of woman? It is contrary\r\nto the customs and the royal edicts of Lothar. Tell me, woman, from\r\nwhose brain have you sprung? Jav’s? No, do not deny it. I know that it\r\ncould be no other than that envious realist. He seeks to tempt me. He\r\nwould see me fall beneath the spell of your charms, and then he, your\r\nmaster, would direct my destiny and—my end. I see it all! I see it\r\nall!”\r\n\r\nThe blood of indignation and anger had been rising to Thuvia’s face.\r\nHer chin was up, a haughty curve upon her perfect lips.\r\n\r\n“I know naught,” she cried, “of what you are prating! I am Thuvia,\r\nPrincess of Ptarth. I am no man’s ‘creature.’ Never before to-day did I\r\nlay eyes upon him you call Jav, nor upon your ridiculous city, of which\r\neven the greatest nations of Barsoom have never dreamed.\r\n\r\n“My charms are not for you, nor such as you. They are not for sale or\r\nbarter, even though the price were a real throne. And as for using them\r\nto win your worse than futile power—” She ended her sentence with a\r\nshrug of her shapely shoulders, and a little scornful laugh.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished Tario was sitting upon the edge of his couch, his\r\nfeet upon the floor. He was leaning forward with eyes no longer half\r\nclosed, but wide with a startled expression in them.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to note the _lèse majesté_ of her words and manner.\r\nThere was evidently something more startling and compelling about her\r\nspeech than that.\r\n\r\nSlowly he came to his feet.\r\n\r\n“By the fangs of Komal!” he muttered. “But you are _real!_ A _real_\r\nwoman! No dream! No vain and foolish figment of the mind!”\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward her, with hands outstretched.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he whispered. “Come, woman! For countless ages have I dreamed\r\nthat some day you would come. And now that you are here I can scarce\r\nbelieve the testimony of my eyes. Even now, knowing that you are real,\r\nI still half dread that you may be a lie.”\r\n\r\nThuvia shrank back. She thought the man mad. Her hand stole to the\r\njewelled hilt of her dagger. The man saw the move, and stopped. A\r\ncunning expression entered his eyes. Then they became at once dreamy\r\nand penetrating as they fairly bored into the girl’s brain.\r\n\r\nThuvia suddenly felt a change coming over her. What the cause of it she\r\ndid not guess; but somehow the man before her began to assume a new\r\nrelationship within her heart.\r\n\r\nNo longer was he a strange and mysterious enemy, but an old and trusted\r\nfriend. Her hand slipped from the dagger’s hilt. Tario came closer. He\r\nspoke gentle, friendly words, and she answered him in a voice that\r\nseemed hers and yet another’s.\r\n\r\nHe was beside her now. His hand was upon her shoulder. His eyes were\r\ndown-bent toward hers. She looked up into his face. His gaze seemed to\r\nbore straight through her to some hidden spring of sentiment within\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer lips parted in sudden awe and wonder at the strange revealment of\r\nher inner self that was being laid bare before her consciousness. She\r\nhad known Tario for ever. He was more than friend to her. She moved a\r\nlittle closer to him. In one swift flood of light she knew the truth.\r\nShe loved Tario, Jeddak of Lothar! She had always loved him.\r\n\r\nThe man, seeing the success of his strategy, could not restrain a faint\r\nsmile of satisfaction. Whether there was something in the expression of\r\nhis face, or whether from Carthoris of Helium in a far chamber of the\r\npalace came a more powerful suggestion, who may say? But something\r\nthere was that suddenly dispelled the strange, hypnotic influence of\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nAs though a mask had been torn from her eyes, Thuvia suddenly saw Tario\r\nas she had formerly seen him, and, accustomed as she was to the strange\r\nmanifestations of highly developed mentality which are common upon\r\nBarsoom, she quickly guessed enough of the truth to know that she was\r\nin grave danger.\r\n\r\nQuickly she took a step backward, tearing herself from his grasp. But\r\nthe momentary contact had aroused within Tario all the long-buried\r\npassions of his loveless existence.\r\n\r\nWith a muffled cry he sprang upon her, throwing his arms about her and\r\nattempting to drag her lips to his.\r\n\r\n“Woman!” he cried. “Lovely woman! Tario would make you queen of Lothar.\r\nListen to me! Listen to the love of the last of the jeddaks of\r\nBarsoom.”\r\n\r\nThuvia struggled to free herself from his embrace.\r\n\r\n“Stop, creature!” she cried. “Stop! I do not love you. Stop, or I shall\r\nscream for help!”\r\n\r\nTario laughed in her face.\r\n\r\n“‘Scream for help,’” he mimicked. “And who within the halls of Lothar\r\nis there who might come in answer to your call? Who would dare enter\r\nthe presence of Tario, unsummoned?”\r\n\r\n“There is one,” she replied, “who would come, and, coming, dare to cut\r\nyou down upon your own throne, if he thought that you had offered\r\naffront to Thuvia of Ptarth!”\r\n\r\n“Who, Jav?” asked Tario.\r\n\r\n“Not Jav, nor any other soft-skinned Lotharian,” she replied; “but a\r\nreal man, a real warrior—Carthoris of Helium!”\r\n\r\nAgain the man laughed at her.\r\n\r\n“You forget the bowmen,” he reminded her. “What could your red warrior\r\naccomplish against my fearless legions?”\r\n\r\nAgain he caught her roughly to him, dragging her towards his couch.\r\n\r\n“If you will not be my queen,” he said, “you shall be my slave.”\r\n\r\n“Neither!” cried the girl.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the single word there was a quick move of her right hand;\r\nTario, releasing her, staggered back, both hands pressed to his side.\r\nAt the same instant the room filled with bowmen, and then the jeddak of\r\nLothar sank senseless to the marble floor.\r\n\r\nAt the instant that he lost consciousness the bowmen were about to\r\nrelease their arrows into Thuvia’s heart. Involuntarily she gave a\r\nsingle cry for help, though she knew that not even Carthoris of Helium\r\ncould save her now.\r\n\r\nThen she closed her eyes and waited for the end. No slender shafts\r\npierced her tender side. She raised her lids to see what stayed the\r\nhand of her executioners.\r\n\r\nThe room was empty save for herself and the still form of the jeddak of\r\nLothar lying at her feet, a little pool of crimson staining the white\r\nmarble of the floor beside him. Tario was unconscious.\r\n\r\nThuvia was amazed. Where were the bowmen? Why had they not loosed their\r\nshafts? What could it all mean?\r\n\r\nAn instant before the room had been mysteriously filled with armed men,\r\nevidently called to protect their jeddak; yet now, with the evidence of\r\nher deed plain before them, they had vanished as mysteriously as they\r\nhad come, leaving her alone with the body of their ruler, into whose\r\nside she had slipped her long, keen blade.\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced apprehensively about, first for signs of the return of\r\nthe bowmen, and then for some means of escape.\r\n\r\nThe wall behind the dais was pierced by two small doorways, hidden by\r\nheavy hangings. Thuvia was running quickly towards one of these when\r\nshe heard the clank of a warrior’s metal at the end of the apartment\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\nAh, if she had but an instant more of time she could have reached that\r\nscreening arras and, perchance, have found some avenue of escape behind\r\nit; but now it was too late—she had been discovered!\r\n\r\nWith a feeling that was akin to apathy she turned to meet her fate, and\r\nthere, before her, running swiftly across the broad chamber to her\r\nside, was Carthoris, his naked long-sword gleaming in his hand.\r\n\r\nFor days she had doubted the intentions of the Heliumite. She had\r\nthought him a party to her abduction. Since Fate had thrown them\r\ntogether she had scarce favoured him with more than the most\r\nperfunctory replies to his remarks, unless at such times as the weird\r\nand uncanny happenings at Lothar had surprised her out of her reserve.\r\n\r\nShe knew that Carthoris of Helium would fight for her; but whether to\r\nsave her for himself or another, she was in doubt.\r\n\r\nHe knew that she was promised to Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, but if he\r\nhad been instrumental in her abduction, his motives could not be\r\nprompted by loyalty to his friend, or regard for her honour.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as she saw him coming across the marble floor of the audience\r\nchamber of Tario of Lothar, his fine eyes filled with apprehension for\r\nher safety, his splendid figure personifying all that is finest in the\r\nfighting men of martial Mars, she could not believe that any faintest\r\ntrace of perfidy lurked beneath so glorious an exterior.\r\n\r\nNever, she thought, in all her life had the sight of any man been so\r\nwelcome to her. It was with difficulty that she refrained from rushing\r\nforward to meet him.\r\n\r\nShe knew that he loved her; but, in time, she recalled that she was\r\npromised to Kulan Tith. Not even might she trust herself to show too\r\ngreat gratitude to the Heliumite, lest he misunderstand.\r\n\r\nCarthoris was by her side now. His quick glance had taken in the scene\r\nwithin the room—the still figure of the jeddak sprawled upon the\r\nfloor—the girl hastening toward a shrouded exit.\r\n\r\n“Did he harm you, Thuvia?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe held up her crimsoned blade that he might see it.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “he did not harm me.”\r\n\r\nA grim smile lighted Carthoris’ face.\r\n\r\n“Praised be our first ancestor!” he murmured. “And now let us see if we\r\nmay not make good our escape from this accursed city before the\r\nLotharians discover that their jeddak is no more.”\r\n\r\nWith the firm authority that sat so well upon him in whose veins flowed\r\nthe blood of John Carter of Virginia and Dejah Thoris of Helium, he\r\ngrasped her hand and, turning back across the hall, strode toward the\r\ngreat doorway through which Jav had brought them into the presence of\r\nthe jeddak earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nThey had almost reached the threshold when a figure sprang into the\r\napartment through another entrance. It was Jav. He, too, took in the\r\nscene within at a glance.\r\n\r\nCarthoris turned to face him, his sword ready in his hand, and his\r\ngreat body shielding the slender figure of the girl.\r\n\r\n“Come, Jav of Lothar!” he cried. “Let us face the issue at once, for\r\nonly one of us may leave this chamber alive with Thuvia of Ptarth.”\r\nThen, seeing that the man wore no sword, he exclaimed: “Bring on your\r\nbowmen, then, or come with us as my prisoner until we have safely\r\npassed the outer portals of thy ghostly city.”\r\n\r\n“You have killed Tario!” exclaimed Jav, ignoring the other’s challenge.\r\n“You have killed Tario! I see his blood upon the floor—real blood—real\r\ndeath. Tario was, after all, as real as I. Yet he was an etherealist.\r\nHe would not materialize his sustenance. Can it be that they are right?\r\nWell, we, too, are right. And all these ages we have been\r\nquarrelling—each saying that the other was wrong!\r\n\r\n“However, he is dead now. Of that I am glad. Now shall Jav come into\r\nhis own. Now shall Jav be Jeddak of Lothar!”\r\n\r\nAs he finished, Tario opened his eyes and then quickly sat up.\r\n\r\n“Traitor! Assassin!” he screamed, and then: “Kadar! Kadar!” which is\r\nthe Barsoomian for guard.\r\n\r\nJav went sickly white. He fell upon his belly, wriggling toward Tario.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my Jeddak, my Jeddak!” he whimpered. “Jav had no hand in this.\r\nJav, your faithful Jav, but just this instant entered the apartment to\r\nfind you lying prone upon the floor and these two strangers about to\r\nleave. How it happened I know not. Believe me, most glorious Jeddak!”\r\n\r\n“Cease, knave!” cried Tario. “I heard your words: ‘However, he is dead\r\nnow. Of that I am glad. Now shall Jav come into his own. Now shall Jav\r\nbe Jeddak of Lothar.’\r\n\r\n“At last, traitor, I have found you out. Your own words have condemned\r\nyou as surely as the acts of these red creatures have sealed their\r\nfates—unless—” He paused. “Unless the woman—”\r\n\r\nBut he got no further. Carthoris guessed what he would have said, and\r\nbefore the words could be uttered he had sprung forward and struck the\r\nman across the mouth with his open palm.\r\n\r\nTario frothed in rage and mortification.\r\n\r\n“And should you again affront the Princess of Ptarth,” warned the\r\nHeliumite, “I shall forget that you wear no sword—not for ever may I\r\ncontrol my itching sword hand.”\r\n\r\nTario shrank back toward the little doorways behind the dais. He was\r\ntrying to speak, but so hideously were the muscles of his face working\r\nthat he could utter no word for several minutes. At last he managed to\r\narticulate intelligibly.\r\n\r\n“Die!” he shrieked. “Die!” and then he turned toward the exit at his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nJav leaped forward, screaming in terror.\r\n\r\n“Have pity, Tario! Have pity! Remember the long ages that I have served\r\nyou faithfully. Remember all that I have done for Lothar. Do not\r\ncondemn me now to the death hideous. Save me! Save me!”\r\n\r\nBut Tario only laughed a mocking laugh and continued to back toward the\r\nhangings that hid the little doorway.\r\n\r\nJav turned toward Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Stop him!” he screamed. “Stop him! If you love life, let him not leave\r\nthis room,” and as he spoke he leaped in pursuit of his jeddak.\r\n\r\nCarthoris followed Jav’s example, but the “last of the jeddaks of\r\nBarsoom” was too quick for them. By the time they reached the arras\r\nbehind which he had disappeared, they found a heavy stone door blocking\r\ntheir further progress.\r\n\r\nJav sank to the floor in a spasm of terror.\r\n\r\n“Come, man!” cried Carthoris. “We are not dead yet. Let us hasten to\r\nthe avenues and make an attempt to leave the city. We are still alive,\r\nand while we live we may yet endeavour to direct our own destinies. Of\r\nwhat avail, to sink spineless to the floor? Come, be a man!”\r\n\r\nJav but shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Did you not hear him call the guards?” he moaned. “Ah, if we could\r\nhave but intercepted him! Then there might have been hope; but, alas,\r\nhe was too quick for us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” exclaimed Carthoris impatiently. “What if he did call the\r\nguards? There will be time enough to worry about that after they\r\ncome—at present I see no indication that they have any idea of\r\nover-exerting themselves to obey their jeddak’s summons.”\r\n\r\nJav shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n“You do not understand,” he said. “The guards have already come—and\r\ngone. They have done their work and we are lost. Look to the various\r\nexits.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris and Thuvia turned their eyes in the direction of the several\r\ndoorways which pierced the walls of the great chamber. Each was tightly\r\nclosed by huge stone doors.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“We are to die the death,” whispered Jav faintly.\r\n\r\nFurther than that he would not say. He just sat upon the edge of the\r\njeddak’s couch and waited.\r\n\r\nCarthoris moved to Thuvia’s side, and, standing there with naked sword,\r\nhe let his brave eyes roam ceaselessly about the great chamber, that no\r\nfoe might spring upon them unseen.\r\n\r\nFor what seemed hours no sound broke the silence of their living tomb.\r\nNo sign gave their executioners of the time or manner of their death.\r\nThe suspense was terrible. Even Carthoris of Helium began to feel the\r\nterrible strain upon his nerves. If he could but know how and whence\r\nthe hand of death was to strike, he could meet it unafraid, but to\r\nsuffer longer the hideous tension of this blighting ignorance of the\r\nplans of their assassins was telling upon him grievously.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth drew quite close to him. She felt safer with the feel\r\nof his arm against hers, and with the contact of her the man took a new\r\ngrip upon himself. With his old-time smile he turned toward her.\r\n\r\n“It would seem that they are trying to frighten us to death,” he said,\r\nlaughing; “and, shame be upon me that I should confess it, I think they\r\nwere close to accomplishing their designs upon me.”\r\n\r\nShe was about to make some reply when a fearful shriek broke from the\r\nlips of the Lotharian.\r\n\r\n“The end is coming!” he cried. “The end is coming! The floor! The\r\nfloor! Oh, Komal, be merciful!”\r\n\r\nThuvia and Carthoris did not need to look at the floor to be aware of\r\nthe strange movement that was taking place.\r\n\r\nSlowly the marble flagging was sinking in all directions toward the\r\ncentre. At first the movement, being gradual, was scarce noticeable;\r\nbut presently the angle of the floor became such that one might stand\r\neasily only by bending one knee considerably.\r\n\r\nJav was shrieking still, and clawing at the royal couch that had\r\nalready commenced to slide toward the centre of the room, where both\r\nThuvia and Carthoris suddenly noted a small orifice which grew in\r\ndiameter as the floor assumed more closely a funnel-like contour.\r\n\r\nNow it became more and more difficult to cling to the dizzy inclination\r\nof the smooth and polished marble.\r\n\r\nCarthoris tried to support Thuvia, but himself commenced to slide and\r\nslip toward the ever-enlarging aperture.\r\n\r\nBetter to cling to the smooth stone he kicked off his sandals of\r\nzitidar hide and with his bare feet braced himself against the\r\nsickening tilt, at the same time throwing his arms supportingly about\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\nIn her terror her own hands clasped about the man’s neck. Her cheek was\r\nclose to his. Death, unseen and of unknown form, seemed close upon\r\nthem, and because unseen and unknowable infinitely more terrifying.\r\n\r\n“Courage, my princess,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nShe looked up into his face to see smiling lips above hers and brave\r\neyes, untouched by terror, drinking deeply of her own.\r\n\r\nThen the floor sagged and tilted more swiftly. There was a sudden\r\nslipping rush as they were precipitated toward the aperture.\r\n\r\nJav’s screams rose weird and horrible in their ears, and then the three\r\nfound themselves piled upon the royal couch of Tario, which had stuck\r\nwithin the aperture at the base of the marble funnel.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they breathed more freely, but presently they discovered\r\nthat the aperture was continuing to enlarge. The couch slipped\r\ndownward. Jav shrieked again. There was a sickening sensation as they\r\nfelt all let go beneath them, as they fell through darkness to an\r\nunknown death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE BATTLE IN THE PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber\r\nbeneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of\r\nTario’s wrath alighted unscathed.\r\n\r\nCarthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast, came to the\r\nground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the shock for the girl. Scarce\r\nhad his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than\r\nhis sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was\r\nlighted, there was no sign of enemy about.\r\n\r\nCarthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear.\r\n\r\n“What is to be our fate?” asked the Heliumite. “Tell me, man! Shake off\r\nyour terror long enough to tell me, so I may be prepared to sell my\r\nlife and that of the Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Komal!” whispered Jav. “We are to be devoured by Komal!”\r\n\r\n“Your deity?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\nThe Lotharian nodded his head. Then he pointed toward a low doorway at\r\none end of the chamber.\r\n\r\n“From thence will he come upon us. Lay aside your puny sword, fool. It\r\nwill but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris smiled, gripping his long-sword the more firmly.\r\n\r\nPresently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time pointing toward\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“He has come,” he whimpered.\r\n\r\nCarthoris and Thuvia looked in the direction the Lotharian had\r\nindicated, expecting to see some strange and fearful creature in human\r\nform; but to their astonishment they saw the broad head and great-maned\r\nshoulders of a huge banth, the largest that either ever had seen.\r\n\r\nSlowly and with dignity the mighty beast advanced into the room. Jav\r\nhad fallen to the floor, and was wriggling his body in the same servile\r\nmanner that he had adopted toward Tario. He spoke to the fierce beast\r\nas he would have spoken to a human being, pleading with it for mercy.\r\n\r\nCarthoris stepped between Thuvia and the banth, his sword ready to\r\ncontest the beast’s victory over them. Thuvia turned toward Jav.\r\n\r\n“Is this Komal, your god?” she asked.\r\n\r\nJav nodded affirmatively. The girl smiled, and then, brushing past\r\nCarthoris, she stepped swiftly toward the growling carnivore.\r\n\r\nIn low, firm tones she spoke to it as she had spoken to the banths of\r\nthe Golden Cliffs and the scavengers before the walls of Lothar.\r\n\r\nThe beast ceased its growling. With lowered head and catlike purr, it\r\ncame slinking to the girl’s feet. Thuvia turned toward Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“It is but a banth,” she said. “We have nothing to fear from it.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris smiled.\r\n\r\n“I did not fear it,” he replied, “for I, too, believed it to be only a\r\nbanth, and I have my long-sword.”\r\n\r\nJav sat up and gazed at the spectacle before him—the slender girl\r\nweaving her fingers in the tawny mane of the huge creature that he had\r\nthought divine, while Komal rubbed his hideous snout against her side.\r\n\r\n“So this is your god!” laughed Thuvia.\r\n\r\nJav looked bewildered. He scarce knew whether he dare chance offending\r\nKomal or not, for so strong is the power of superstition that even\r\nthough we know that we have been reverencing a sham, yet still we\r\nhesitate to admit the validity of our new-found convictions.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “this is Komal. For ages the enemies of Tario have been\r\nhurled to this pit to fill his maw, for Komal must be fed.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any way out of this chamber to the avenues of the city?”\r\nasked Carthoris.\r\n\r\nJav shrugged.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” he replied. “Never have I been here before, nor ever\r\nhave I cared to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” suggested Thuvia, “let us explore. There must be a way out.”\r\n\r\nTogether the three approached the doorway through which Komal had\r\nentered the apartment that was to have witnessed their deaths. Beyond\r\nwas a low-roofed lair, with a small door at the far end.\r\n\r\nThis, to their delight, opened to the lifting of an ordinary latch,\r\nletting them into a circular arena, surrounded by tiers of seats.\r\n\r\n“Here is where Komal is fed in public,” explained Jav. “Had Tario dared\r\nit would have been here that our fates had been sealed; but he feared\r\ntoo much thy keen blade, red man, and so he hurled us all downward to\r\nthe pit. I did not know how closely connected were the two chambers.\r\nNow we may easily reach the avenues and the city gates. Only the bowmen\r\nmay dispute the right of way, and, knowing their secret, I doubt that\r\nthey have power to harm us.”\r\n\r\nAnother door led to a flight of steps that rose from the arena level\r\nupward through the seats to an exit at the back of the hall. Beyond\r\nthis was a straight, broad corridor, running directly through the\r\npalace to the gardens at the side.\r\n\r\nNo one appeared to question them as they advanced, mighty Komal pacing\r\nby the girl’s side.\r\n\r\n“Where are the people of the palace—the jeddak’s retinue?” asked\r\nCarthoris. “Even in the city streets as we came through I scarce saw\r\nsign of a human being, yet all about are evidences of a mighty\r\npopulation.”\r\n\r\nJav sighed.\r\n\r\n“Poor Lothar,” he said. “It is indeed a city of ghosts. There are\r\nscarce a thousand of us left, who once were numbered in the millions.\r\nOur great city is peopled by the creatures of our own imaginings. For\r\nour own needs we do not take the trouble to materialize these peoples\r\nof our brain, yet they are apparent to us.\r\n\r\n“Even now I see great throngs lining the avenue, hastening to and fro\r\nin the round of their duties. I see women and children laughing on the\r\nbalconies—these we are forbidden to materialize; but yet I see\r\nthem—they are here. . . . But why not?” he mused. “No longer need I\r\nfear Tario—he has done his worst, and failed. Why not indeed?\r\n\r\n“Stay, friends,” he continued. “Would you see Lothar in all her glory?”\r\n\r\nCarthoris and Thuvia nodded their assent, more out of courtesy than\r\nbecause they fully grasped the import of his mutterings.\r\n\r\nJav gazed at them penetratingly for an instant, then, with a wave of\r\nhis hand, cried: “Look!”\r\n\r\nThe sight that met them was awe-inspiring. Where before there had been\r\nnaught but deserted pavements and scarlet swards, yawning windows and\r\ntenantless doors, now swarmed a countless multitude of happy, laughing\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“It is the past,” said Jav in a low voice. “They do not see us—they but\r\nlive the old dead past of ancient Lothar—the dead and crumbled Lothar\r\nof antiquity, which stood upon the shore of Throxus, mightiest of the\r\nfive oceans.\r\n\r\n“See those fine, upstanding men swinging along the broad avenue? See\r\nthe young girls and the women smile upon them? See the men greet them\r\nwith love and respect? Those be seafarers coming up from their ships\r\nwhich lie at the quays at the city’s edge.\r\n\r\n“Brave men, they—ah, but the glory of Lothar has faded! See their\r\nweapons. They alone bore arms, for they crossed the five seas to\r\nstrange places where dangers were. With their passing passed the\r\nmartial spirit of the Lotharians, leaving, as the ages rolled by, a\r\nrace of spineless cowards.\r\n\r\n“We hated war, and so we trained not our youth in warlike ways. Thus\r\nfollowed our undoing, for when the seas dried and the green hordes\r\nencroached upon us we could do naught but flee. But we remembered the\r\nseafaring bowmen of the days of our glory—it is the memory of these\r\nwhich we hurl upon our enemies.”\r\n\r\nAs Jav ceased speaking, the picture faded, and once more, the three\r\ntook up their way toward the distant gates, along deserted avenues.\r\n\r\nTwice they sighted Lotharians of flesh and blood. At sight of them and\r\nthe huge banth which they must have recognized as Komal, the citizens\r\nturned and fled.\r\n\r\n“They will carry word of our flight to Tario,” cried Jav, “and soon he\r\nwill send his bowmen after us. Let us hope that our theory is correct,\r\nand that their shafts are powerless against minds cognizant of their\r\nunreality. Otherwise we are doomed.\r\n\r\n“Explain, red man, to the woman the truths that I have explained to\r\nyou, that she may meet the arrows with a stronger counter-suggestion of\r\nimmunity.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris did as Jav bid him; but they came to the great gates without\r\nsign of pursuit developing. Here Jav set in motion the mechanism that\r\nrolled the huge, wheel-like gate aside, and a moment later the three,\r\naccompanied by the banth, stepped out into the plain before Lothar.\r\n\r\nScarce had they covered a hundred yards when the sound of many men\r\nshouting arose behind them. As they turned they saw a company of bowmen\r\ndebouching upon the plain from the gate through which they had but just\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nUpon the wall above the gate were a number of Lotharians, among whom\r\nJav recognized Tario. The jeddak stood glaring at them, evidently\r\nconcentrating all the forces of his trained mind upon them. That he was\r\nmaking a supreme effort to render his imaginary creatures deadly was\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nJav turned white, and commenced to tremble. At the crucial moment he\r\nappeared to lose the courage of his conviction. The great banth turned\r\nback toward the advancing bowmen and growled. Carthoris placed himself\r\nbetween Thuvia and the enemy and, facing them, awaited the outcome of\r\ntheir charge.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an inspiration came to Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Hurl your own bowmen against Tario’s!” he cried to Jav. “Let us see a\r\nmaterialized battle between two mentalities.”\r\n\r\nThe suggestion seemed to hearten the Lotharian, and in another moment\r\nthe three stood behind solid ranks of huge bowmen who hurled taunts and\r\nmenaces at the advancing company emerging from the walled city.\r\n\r\nJav was a new man the moment his battalions stood between him and\r\nTario. One could almost have sworn the man believed these creatures of\r\nhis strange hypnotic power to be real flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nWith hoarse battle cries they charged the bowmen of Tario. Barbed\r\nshafts flew thick and fast. Men fell, and the ground was red with gore.\r\n\r\nCarthoris and Thuvia had difficulty in reconciling the reality of it\r\nall with their knowledge of the truth. They saw utan after utan march\r\nfrom the gate in perfect step to reinforce the outnumbered company\r\nwhich Tario had first sent forth to arrest them.\r\n\r\nThey saw Jav’s forces grow correspondingly until all about them rolled\r\na sea of fighting, cursing warriors, and the dead lay in heaps about\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nJav and Tario seemed to have forgotten all else beside the struggling\r\nbowmen that surged to and fro, filling the broad field between the\r\nforest and the city.\r\n\r\nThe wood loomed close behind Thuvia and Carthoris. The latter cast a\r\nglance toward Jav.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he whispered to the girl. “Let them fight out their empty\r\nbattle—neither, evidently, has power to harm the other. They are like\r\ntwo controversialists hurling words at one another. While they are\r\nengaged we may as well be devoting our energies to an attempt to find\r\nthe passage through the cliffs to the plain beyond.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Jav, turning from the battle for an instant, caught his\r\nwords. He saw the girl move to accompany the Heliumite. A cunning look\r\nleaped to the Lotharian’s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe thing that lay beyond that look had been deep in his heart since\r\nfirst he had laid eyes upon Thuvia of Ptarth. He had not recognized it,\r\nhowever, until now that she seemed about to pass out of his existence.\r\n\r\nHe centred his mind upon the Heliumite and the girl for an instant.\r\n\r\nCarthoris saw Thuvia of Ptarth step forward with outstretched hand. He\r\nwas surprised at this sudden softening toward him, and it was with a\r\nfull heart that he let his fingers close upon hers, as together they\r\nturned away from forgotten Lothar, into the woods, and bent their steps\r\ntoward the distant mountains.\r\n\r\nAs the Lotharian had turned toward them, Thuvia had been surprised to\r\nhear Carthoris suddenly voice a new plan.\r\n\r\n“Remain here with Jav,” she had heard him say, “while I go to search\r\nfor the passage through the cliffs.”\r\n\r\nShe had dropped back in surprise and disappointment, for she knew that\r\nthere was no reason why she should not have accompanied him. Certainly\r\nshe should have been safer with him than left here alone with the\r\nLotharian.\r\n\r\nAnd Jav watched the two and smiled his cunning smile.\r\n\r\nWhen Carthoris had disappeared within the wood, Thuvia seated herself\r\napathetically upon the scarlet sward to watch the seemingly\r\ninterminable struggles of the bowmen.\r\n\r\nThe long afternoon dragged its weary way toward darkness, and still the\r\nimaginary legions charged and retreated. The sun was about to set when\r\nTario commenced to withdraw his troops slowly toward the city.\r\n\r\nHis plan for cessation of hostilities through the night evidently met\r\nwith Jav’s entire approval, for he caused his forces to form themselves\r\nin orderly utans and march just within the edge of the wood, where they\r\nwere soon busily engaged in preparing their evening meal, and spreading\r\ndown their sleeping silks and furs for the night.\r\n\r\nThuvia could scarce repress a smile as she noted the scrupulous care\r\nwith which Jav’s imaginary men attended to each tiny detail of\r\ndeportment as truly as if they had been real flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nSentries were posted between the camp and the city. Officers clanked\r\nhither and thither issuing commands and seeing to it that they were\r\nproperly carried out.\r\n\r\nThuvia turned toward Jav.\r\n\r\n“Why is it,” she asked, “that you observe such careful nicety in the\r\nregulation of your creatures when Tario knows quite as well as you that\r\nthey are but figments of your brain? Why not permit them simply to\r\ndissolve into thin air until you again require their futile service?”\r\n\r\n“You do not understand them,” replied Jav. “While they exist they are\r\nreal. I do but call them into being now, and in a way direct their\r\ngeneral actions. But thereafter, until I dissolve them, they are as\r\nactual as you or I. Their officers command them, under my guidance. I\r\nam the general—that is all. And the psychological effect upon the enemy\r\nis far greater than were I to treat them merely as substanceless\r\nvagaries.\r\n\r\n“Then, too,” continued the Lotharian, “there is always the hope, which\r\nwith us is little short of belief, that some day these materializations\r\nwill merge into the real—that they will remain, some of them, after we\r\nhave dissolved their fellows, and that thus we shall have discovered a\r\nmeans for perpetuating our dying race.\r\n\r\n“Some there are who claim already to have accomplished the thing. It is\r\ngenerally supposed that the etherealists have quite a few among their\r\nnumber who are permanent materializations. It is even said that such is\r\nTario, but that cannot be, for he existed before we had discovered the\r\nfull possibilities of suggestion.\r\n\r\n“There are others among us who insist that none of us is real. That we\r\ncould not have existed all these ages without material food and water\r\nhad we ourselves been material. Although I am a realist, I rather\r\nincline toward this belief myself.\r\n\r\n“It seems well and sensibly based upon the belief that our ancient\r\nforbears developed before their extinction such wondrous mentalities\r\nthat some of the stronger minds among them lived after the death of\r\ntheir bodies—that we are but the deathless minds of individuals long\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n“It would appear possible, and yet in so far as I am concerned I have\r\nall the attributes of corporeal existence. I eat, I sleep”—he paused,\r\ncasting a meaning look upon the girl—“I love!”\r\n\r\nThuvia could not mistake the palpable meaning of his words and\r\nexpression. She turned away with a little shrug of disgust that was not\r\nlost upon the Lotharian.\r\n\r\nHe came close to her and seized her arm.\r\n\r\n“Why not Jav?” he cried. “Who more honourable than the second of the\r\nworld’s most ancient race? Your Heliumite? He has gone. He has deserted\r\nyou to your fate to save himself. Come, be Jav’s!”\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth rose to her full height, her lifted shoulder turned\r\ntoward the man, her haughty chin upraised, a scornful twist to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“You lie!” she said quietly, “the Heliumite knows less of disloyalty\r\nthan he knows of fear, and of fear he is as ignorant as the unhatched\r\nyoung.”\r\n\r\n“Then where is he?” taunted the Lotharian. “I tell you he has fled the\r\nvalley. He has left you to your fate. But Jav will see that it is a\r\npleasant one. To-morrow we shall return into Lothar at the head of my\r\nvictorious army, and I shall be jeddak and you shall be my consort.\r\nCome!” And he attempted to crush her to his breast.\r\n\r\nThe girl struggled to free herself, striking at the man with her metal\r\narmlets. Yet still he drew her toward him, until both were suddenly\r\nstartled by a hideous growl that rumbled from the dark wood close\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nKAR KOMAK, THE BOWMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Carthoris moved through the forest toward the distant cliffs with\r\nThuvia’s hand still tight pressed in his, he wondered a little at the\r\ngirl’s continued silence, yet the contact of her cool palm against his\r\nwas so pleasant that he feared to break the spell of her new-found\r\nreliance in him by speaking.\r\n\r\nOnward through the dim wood they passed until the shadows of the quick\r\ncoming Martian night commenced to close down upon them. Then it was\r\nthat Carthoris turned to speak to the girl at his side.\r\n\r\nThey must plan together for the future. It was his idea to pass through\r\nthe cliffs at once if they could locate the passage, and he was quite\r\npositive that they were now close to it; but he wanted her assent to\r\nthe proposition.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes rested upon her, he was struck by her strangely ethereal\r\nappearance. She seemed suddenly to have dissolved into the tenuous\r\nsubstance of a dream, and as he continued to gaze upon her, she faded\r\nslowly from his sight.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he was dumbfounded, and then the whole truth flashed\r\nsuddenly upon him. Jav had caused him to believe that Thuvia was\r\naccompanying him through the wood while, as a matter of fact, he had\r\ndetained the girl for himself!\r\n\r\nCarthoris was horrified. He cursed himself for his stupidity, and yet\r\nhe knew that the fiendish power which the Lotharian had invoked to\r\nconfuse him might have deceived any.\r\n\r\nScarce had he realized the truth than he had started to retrace his\r\nsteps toward Lothar, but now he moved at a trot, the Earthly thews that\r\nhe had inherited from his father carrying him swiftly over the soft\r\ncarpet of fallen leaves and rank grass.\r\n\r\n_Thuria_’s brilliant light flooded the plain before the walled city of\r\nLothar as Carthoris broke from the wood opposite the great gate that\r\nhad given the fugitives egress from the city earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nAt first he saw no indication that there was another than himself\r\nanywhere about. The plain was deserted. No myriad bowmen camped now\r\nbeneath the overhanging verdure of the giant trees. No gory heaps of\r\ntortured dead defaced the beauty of the scarlet sward. All was silence.\r\nAll was peace.\r\n\r\nThe Heliumite, scarce pausing at the forest’s verge, pushed on across\r\nthe plain toward the city, when presently he descried a huddled form in\r\nthe grass at his feet.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of a man, lying prone. Carthoris turned the figure over\r\nupon its back. It was Jav, but torn and mangled almost beyond\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nThe prince bent low to note if any spark of life remained, and as he\r\ndid so the lids raised and dull, suffering eyes looked up into his.\r\n\r\n“The Princess of Ptarth!” cried Carthoris. “Where is she? Answer me,\r\nman, or I complete the work that another has so well begun.”\r\n\r\n“Komal,” muttered Jav. “He sprang upon me . . . and would have devoured\r\nme but for the girl. Then they went away together into the wood—the\r\ngirl and the great banth . . . her fingers twined in his tawny mane.”\r\n\r\n“Which way went they?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“There,” replied Jav faintly, “toward the passage through the cliffs.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Helium waited to hear no more, but springing to his feet,\r\nraced back again into the forest.\r\n\r\nIt was dawn when he reached the mouth of the dark tunnel that would\r\nlead him to the other world beyond this valley of ghostly memories and\r\nstrange hypnotic influences and menaces.\r\n\r\nWithin the long, dark passages he met with no accident or obstacle,\r\ncoming at last into the light of day beyond the mountains, and no great\r\ndistance from the southern verge of the domains of the Torquasians, not\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty haad at the most.\r\n\r\nFrom the boundary of Torquas to the city of Aaanthor is a distance of\r\nsome two hundred haads, so that the Heliumite had before him a journey\r\nof more than one hundred and fifty Earth miles between him and\r\nAaanthor.\r\n\r\nHe could at best but hazard a chance guess that toward Aaanthor Thuvia\r\nwould take her flight. There lay the nearest water, and there might be\r\nexpected some day a rescuing party from her father’s empire; for\r\nCarthoris knew Thuvan Dihn well enough to know that he would leave no\r\nstone unturned until he had tracked down the truth as to his daughter’s\r\nabduction, and learned all that there might be to learn of her\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nHe realized, of course, that the trick which had laid suspicion upon\r\nhim would greatly delay the discovery of the truth, but little did he\r\nguess to what vast proportions had the results of the villainy of Astok\r\nof Dusar already grown.\r\n\r\nEven as he emerged from the mouth of the passage to look across the\r\nfoothills in the direction of Aaanthor, a Ptarth battle fleet was\r\nwinging its majestic way slowly toward the twin cities of Helium, while\r\nfrom far distant Kaol raced another mighty armada to join forces with\r\nits ally.\r\n\r\nHe did not know that in the face of the circumstantial evidence against\r\nhim even his own people had commenced to entertain suspicions that he\r\nmight have stolen the Ptarthian princess.\r\n\r\nHe did not know of the lengths to which the Dusarians had gone to\r\ndisrupt the friendship and alliance which existed between the three\r\ngreat powers of the eastern hemisphere—Helium, Ptarth and Kaol.\r\n\r\nHow Dusarian emissaries had found employment in important posts in the\r\nforeign offices of the three great nations, and how, through these men,\r\nmessages from one jeddak to another were altered and garbled until the\r\npatience and pride of the three rulers and former friends could no\r\nlonger endure the humiliations and insults contained in these falsified\r\npapers—not any of this he knew.\r\n\r\nNor did he know how even to the last John Carter, Warlord of Mars, had\r\nrefused to permit the jeddak of Helium to declare war against either\r\nPtarth or Kaol, because of his implicit belief in his son, and that\r\neventually all would be satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\nAnd now two great fleets were moving upon Helium, while the Dusarian\r\nspies at the court of Tardos Mors saw to it that the twin cities\r\nremained in ignorance of their danger.\r\n\r\nWar had been declared by Thuvan Dihn, but the messenger who had been\r\ndispatched with the proclamation had been a Dusarian who had seen to it\r\nthat no word of warning reached the twin cities of the approach of a\r\nhostile fleet.\r\n\r\nFor several days diplomatic relations had been severed between Helium\r\nand her two most powerful neighbors, and with the departure of the\r\nministers had come a total cessation of wireless communication between\r\nthe disputants, as is usual upon Barsoom.\r\n\r\nBut of all this Carthoris was ignorant. All that interested him at\r\npresent was the finding of Thuvia of Ptarth. Her trail beside that of\r\nthe huge banth had been well marked to the tunnel, and was once more\r\nvisible leading southward into the foothills.\r\n\r\nAs he followed rapidly downward toward the dead sea-bottom, where he\r\nknew he must lose the spoor in the resilient ochre vegetation, he was\r\nsuddenly surprised to see a naked man approaching him from the\r\nnorth-east.\r\n\r\nAs the fellow drew closer, Carthoris halted to await his coming. He\r\nknew that the man was unarmed, and that he was apparently a Lotharian,\r\nfor his skin was white and his hair auburn.\r\n\r\nHe approached the Heliumite without sign of fear, and when quite close\r\ncalled out the cheery Barsoomian “kaor” of greeting.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“I am Kar Komak, odwar of the bowmen,” replied the other. “A strange\r\nthing has happened to me. For ages Tario has been bringing me into\r\nexistence as he needed the services of the army of his mind. Of all the\r\nbowmen it has been Kar Komak who has been oftenest materialized.\r\n\r\n“For a long time Tario has been concentrating his mind upon my\r\npermanent materialization. It has been an obsession with him that some\r\nday this thing could be accomplished and the future of Lothar assured.\r\nHe asserted that matter was nonexistent except in the imagination of\r\nman—that all was mental, and so he believed that by persisting in his\r\nsuggestion he could eventually make of me a permanent suggestion in the\r\nminds of all creatures.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday he succeeded, but at such a time! It must have come all\r\nunknown to him, as it came to me without my knowledge, as, with my\r\nhorde of yelling bowmen, I pursued the fleeing Torquasians back to\r\ntheir ochre plains.\r\n\r\n“As darkness settled and the time came for us to fade once more into\r\nthin air, I suddenly found myself alone upon the edge of the great\r\nplain which lies yonder at the foot of the low hills.\r\n\r\n“My men were gone back to the nothingness from which they had sprung,\r\nbut I remained—naked and unarmed.\r\n\r\n“At first I could not understand, but at last came a realization of\r\nwhat had occurred. Tario’s long suggestions had at last prevailed, and\r\nKar Komak had become a reality in the world of men; but my harness and\r\nmy weapons had faded away with my fellows, leaving me naked and unarmed\r\nin a hostile country far from Lothar.”\r\n\r\n“You wish to return to Lothar?” asked Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“No!” replied Kar Komak quickly. “I have no love for Tario. Being a\r\ncreature of his mind, I know him too well. He is cruel and tyrannical—a\r\nmaster I have no desire to serve. Now that he has succeeded in\r\naccomplishing my permanent materialization, he will be unbearable, and\r\nhe will go on until he has filled Lothar with his creatures. I wonder\r\nif he has succeeded as well with the maid of Lothar.”\r\n\r\n“I thought there were no women there,” said Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“In a hidden apartment in the palace of Tario,” replied Kar Komak, “the\r\njeddak has maintained the suggestion of a beautiful girl, hoping that\r\nsome day she would become permanent. I have seen her there. She is\r\nwonderful! But for her sake I hope that Tario succeeds not so well with\r\nher as he has with me.\r\n\r\n“Now, red man, I have told you of myself—what of you?”\r\n\r\nCarthoris liked the face and manner of the bowman. There had been no\r\nsign of doubt or fear in his expression as he had approached the\r\nheavily-armed Heliumite, and he had spoken directly and to the point.\r\n\r\nSo the Prince of Helium told the bowman of Lothar who he was and what\r\nadventure had brought him to this far country.\r\n\r\n“Good!” exclaimed the other, when he had done. “Kar Komak will\r\naccompany you. Together we shall find the Princess of Ptarth and with\r\nyou Kar Komak will return to the world of men—such a world as he knew\r\nin the long-gone past when the ships of mighty Lothar ploughed angry\r\nThroxus, and the roaring surf beat against the barrier of these parched\r\nand dreary hills.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” asked Carthoris. “Had you really a former actual\r\nexistence?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” replied Kar Komak. “In my day I commanded the fleets\r\nof Lothar—mightiest of all the fleets that sailed the five salt seas.\r\n\r\n“Wherever men lived upon Barsoom there was the name of Kar Komak known\r\nand respected. Peaceful were the land races in those distant days—only\r\nthe seafarers were warriors; but now has the glory of the past faded,\r\nnor did I think until I met you that there remained upon Barsoom a\r\nsingle person of our own mould who lived and loved and fought as did\r\nthe ancient seafarers of my time.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but it will seem good to see men once again—real men! Never had I\r\nmuch respect for the landsmen of my day. They remained in their walled\r\ncities wasting their time in play, depending for their protection\r\nentirely upon the sea race. And the poor creatures who remain, the\r\nTarios and Javs of Lothar, are even worse than their ancient forbears.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris was a trifle skeptical as to the wisdom of permitting the\r\nstranger to attach himself to him. There was always the chance that he\r\nwas but the essence of some hypnotic treachery which Tario or Jav was\r\nattempting to exert upon the Heliumite; and yet, so sincere had been\r\nthe manner and the words of the bowman, so much the fighting man did he\r\nseem, but Carthoris could not find it in his heart to doubt him.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the matter was that he gave the naked odwar leave to\r\naccompany him, and together they set out upon the spoor of Thuvia and\r\nKomal.\r\n\r\nDown to the ochre sea-bottom the trail led. There it disappeared, as\r\nCarthoris had known that it would; but where it entered the plain its\r\ndirection had been toward Aaanthor and so toward Aaanthor the two\r\nturned their faces.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and tedious journey, fraught with many dangers. The\r\nbowman could not travel at the pace set by Carthoris, whose muscles\r\ncarried him with great rapidity over the face of the small planet, the\r\nforce of gravity of which exerts so much less retarding power than that\r\nof the Earth. Fifty miles a day is a fair average for a Barsoomian, but\r\nthe son of John Carter might easily have covered a hundred or more\r\nmiles had he cared to desert his new-found comrade.\r\n\r\nAll the way they were in constant danger of discovery by roving bands\r\nof Torquasians, and especially was this true before they reached the\r\nboundary of Torquas.\r\n\r\nGood fortune was with them, however, and although they sighted two\r\ndetachments of the savage green men, they were not themselves seen.\r\n\r\nAnd so they came, upon the morning of the third day, within sight of\r\nthe glistening domes of distant Aaanthor. Throughout the journey\r\nCarthoris had ever strained his eyes ahead in search of Thuvia and the\r\ngreat banth; but not till now had he seen aught to give him hope.\r\n\r\nThis morning, far ahead, half-way between themselves and Aaanthor, the\r\nmen saw two tiny figures moving toward the city. For a moment they\r\nwatched them intently. Then Carthoris, convinced, leaped forward at a\r\nrapid run, Kar Komak following as swiftly as he could.\r\n\r\nThe Heliumite shouted to attract the girl’s attention, and presently he\r\nwas rewarded by seeing her turn and stand looking toward him. At her\r\nside the great banth stood with up-pricked ears, watching the\r\napproaching man.\r\n\r\nNot yet could Thuvia of Ptarth have recognized Carthoris, though that\r\nit was he she must have been convinced, for she waited there for him\r\nwithout sign of fear.\r\n\r\nPresently he saw her point toward the northwest, beyond him. Without\r\nslackening his pace, he turned his eyes in the direction she indicated.\r\n\r\nRacing silently over the thick vegetation, not half a mile behind, came\r\na score of fierce green warriors, charging him upon their mighty\r\nthoats.\r\n\r\nTo their right was Kar Komak, naked and unarmed, yet running valiantly\r\ntoward Carthoris and shouting warning as though he, too, had but just\r\ndiscovered the silent, menacing company that moved so swiftly forward\r\nwith couched spears and ready long-swords.\r\n\r\nCarthoris shouted to the Lotharian, warning him back, for he knew that\r\nhe could but uselessly sacrifice his life by placing himself, all\r\nunarmed, in the path of the cruel and relentless savages.\r\n\r\nBut Kar Komak never hesitated. With shouts of encouragement to his new\r\nfriend, he hurried onward toward the Prince of Helium. The red man’s\r\nheart leaped in response to this exhibition of courage and\r\nself-sacrifice. He regretted now that he had not thought to give Kar\r\nKomak one of his swords; but it was too late to attempt it, for should\r\nhe wait for the Lotharian to overtake him or return to meet him, the\r\nTorquasians would reach Thuvia of Ptarth before he could do so.\r\n\r\nEven as it was, it would be nip and tuck as to who came first to her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAgain he turned his face in her direction, and now, from Aaanthor way,\r\nhe saw a new force hastening toward them—two medium-sized war craft—and\r\neven at the distance they still were from him he discerned the device\r\nof Dusar upon their bows.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, seemed little hope for Thuvia of Ptarth. With savage\r\nwarriors of the hordes of Torquas charging toward her from one\r\ndirection, and no less implacable enemies, in the form of the creatures\r\nof Astok, Prince of Dusar, bearing down upon her from another, while\r\nonly a banth, a red warrior, and an unarmed bowman were near to defend\r\nher, her plight was quite hopeless and her cause already lost ere ever\r\nit was contested.\r\n\r\nAs Thuvia saw Carthoris approaching, she felt again that unaccountable\r\nsensation of entire relief from responsibility and fear that she had\r\nexperienced upon a former occasion. Nor could she account for it while\r\nher mind still tried to convince her heart that the Prince of Helium\r\nhad been instrumental in her abduction from her father’s court. She\r\nonly knew that she was glad when he was by her side, and that with him\r\nthere all things seemed possible—even such impossible things as escape\r\nfrom her present predicament.\r\n\r\nNow had he stopped, panting, before her. A brave smile of encouragement\r\nlit his face.\r\n\r\n“Courage, my princess,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nTo the girl’s memory flashed the occasion upon which he had used those\r\nsame words—in the throne-room of Tario of Lothar as they had commenced\r\nto slip down the sinking marble floor toward an unknown fate.\r\n\r\nThen she had not chidden him for the use of that familiar salutation,\r\nnor did she chide him now, though she was promised to another. She\r\nwondered at herself—flushing at her own turpitude; for upon Barsoom it\r\nis a shameful thing for a woman to listen to those two words from\r\nanother than her husband or her betrothed.\r\n\r\nCarthoris saw her flush of mortification, and in an instant regretted\r\nhis words. There was but a moment before the green warriors would be\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me!” said the man in a low voice. “Let my great love be my\r\nexcuse—that, and the belief that I have but a moment more of life,” and\r\nwith the words he turned to meet the foremost of the green warriors.\r\n\r\nThe fellow was charging with couched spear, but Carthoris leaped to one\r\nside, and as the great thoat and its rider hurtled harmlessly past him\r\nhe swung his long-sword in a mighty cut that clove the green carcass in\r\ntwain.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Kar Komak leaped with bare hands clawing at the leg\r\nof another of the huge riders; the balance of the horde raced in to\r\nclose quarters, dismounting the better to wield their favourite\r\nlong-swords; the Dusarian fliers touched the soft carpet of the\r\nochre-clad sea-bottom, disgorging fifty fighting men from their bowels;\r\nand into the swirling sea of cutting, slashing swords sprang Komal, the\r\ngreat banth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nGREEN MEN AND WHITE APES\r\n\r\n\r\nA Torquasian sword smote a glancing blow across the forehead of\r\nCarthoris. He had a fleeting vision of soft arms about his neck, and\r\nwarm lips close to his before he lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nHow long he lay there senseless he could not guess; but when he opened\r\nhis eyes again he was alone, except for the bodies of the dead green\r\nmen and Dusarians, and the carcass of a great banth that lay half\r\nacross his own.\r\n\r\nThuvia was gone, nor was the body of Kar Komak among the dead.\r\n\r\nWeak from loss of blood, Carthoris made his way slowly toward Aaanthor,\r\nreaching its outskirts at dark.\r\n\r\nHe wanted water more than any other thing, and so he kept on up a broad\r\navenue toward the great central plaza, where he knew the precious fluid\r\nwas to be found in a half-ruined building opposite the great palace of\r\nthe ancient jeddak, who once had ruled this mighty city.\r\n\r\nDisheartened and discouraged by the strange sequence of events that\r\nseemed fore-ordained to thwart his every attempt to serve the Princess\r\nof Ptarth, he paid little or no attention to his surroundings, moving\r\nthrough the deserted city as though no great white apes lurked in the\r\nblack shadows of the mystery-haunted piles that flanked the broad\r\navenues and the great plaza.\r\n\r\nBut if Carthoris was careless of his surroundings, not so other eyes\r\nthat watched his entrance into the plaza, and followed his slow\r\nfootsteps toward the marble pile that housed the tiny, half-choked\r\nspring whose water one might gain only by scratching a deep hole in the\r\nred sand that covered it.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Heliumite entered the small building a dozen mighty,\r\ngrotesque figures emerged from the doorway of the palace to speed\r\nnoiselessly across the plaza toward him.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour Carthoris remained in the building, digging for water\r\nand gaining the few much-needed drops which were the fruits of his\r\nlabour. Then he rose and slowly left the structure. Scarce had he\r\nstepped beyond the threshold than twelve Torquasian warriors leaped\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nNo time then to draw long-sword; but swift from his harness flew his\r\nlong, slim dagger, and as he went down beneath them more than a single\r\ngreen heart ceased beating at the bite of that keen point.\r\n\r\nThen they overpowered him and took his weapons away; but only nine of\r\nthe twelve warriors who had crossed the plaza returned with their\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nThey dragged their prisoner roughly to the palace pits, where in utter\r\ndarkness they chained him with rusty links to the solid masonry of the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow Thar Ban will speak with you,” they said. “Now he sleeps.\r\nBut great will be his pleasure when he learns who has wandered amongst\r\nus—and great will be the pleasure of Hortan Gur when Thar Ban drags\r\nbefore him the mad fool who dared prick the great jeddak with his\r\nsword.”\r\n\r\nThen they left him to the silence and the darkness.\r\n\r\nFor what seemed hours Carthoris squatted upon the stone floor of his\r\nprison, his back against the wall in which was sunk the heavy eye-bolt\r\nthat secured the chain which held him.\r\n\r\nThen, from out of the mysterious blackness before him, there came to\r\nhis ears the sound of naked feet moving stealthily upon\r\nstone—approaching nearer and nearer to where he lay, unarmed and\r\ndefenceless.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed—minutes that seemed hours—during which time periods of\r\nsepulchral silence would be followed by a repetition of the uncanny\r\nscraping of naked feet slinking warily upon him.\r\n\r\nAt last he heard a sudden rush of unshod soles across the empty\r\nblackness, and at a little distance a scuffling sound, heavy breathing,\r\nand once what he thought the muttered imprecation of a man battling\r\nagainst great odds. Then the clanging of a chain, and a noise as of the\r\nsnapping back against stone of a broken link.\r\n\r\nAgain came silence. But for a moment only. Now he heard once more the\r\nsoft feet approaching him. He thought that he discerned wicked eyes\r\ngleaming fearfully at him through the darkness. He knew that he could\r\nhear the heavy breathing of powerful lungs.\r\n\r\nThen came the rush of many feet toward him, and the _things_ were upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHands terminating in manlike fingers clutched at his throat and arms\r\nand legs. Hairy bodies strained and struggled against his own smooth\r\nhide as he battled in grim silence against these horrid foemen in the\r\ndarkness of the pits of ancient Aaanthor.\r\n\r\nThewed like some giant god was Carthoris of Helium, yet in the clutches\r\nof these unseen creatures of the pit’s Stygian night he was helpless as\r\na frail woman.\r\n\r\nYet he battled on, striking futile blows against great, hispid breasts\r\nhe could not see; feeling thick, squat throats beneath his fingers; the\r\ndrool of saliva upon his cheek, and hot, foul breath in his nostrils.\r\n\r\nFangs, too, mighty fangs, he knew were close, and why they did not sink\r\ninto his flesh he could not guess.\r\n\r\nAt last he became aware of the mighty surging of a number of his\r\nantagonists back and forth upon the great chain that held him, and\r\npresently came the same sound that he had heard at a little distance\r\nfrom him a short time before he had been attacked—his chain had parted\r\nand the broken end snapped back against the stone wall.\r\n\r\nNow he was seized upon either side and dragged at a rapid pace through\r\nthe dark corridors—toward what fate he could not even guess.\r\n\r\nAt first he had thought his foes might be of the tribe of Torquas, but\r\ntheir hairy bodies belied that belief. Now he was at last quite sure of\r\ntheir identity, though why they had not killed and devoured him at once\r\nhe could not imagine.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour or more of rapid racing through the underground\r\npassages that are a distinguishing feature of all Barsoomian cities,\r\nmodern as well as ancient, his captors suddenly emerged into the\r\nmoonlight of a courtyard, far from the central plaza.\r\n\r\nImmediately Carthoris saw that he was in the power of a tribe of the\r\ngreat white apes of Barsoom. All that had caused him doubt before as to\r\nthe identity of his attackers was the hairiness of their breasts, for\r\nthe white apes are entirely hairless except for a great shock bristling\r\nfrom their heads.\r\n\r\nNow he saw the cause of that which had deceived him—across the chest of\r\neach of them were strips of hairy hide, usually of banth, in imitation\r\nof the harness of the green warriors who so often camped at their\r\ndeserted city.\r\n\r\nCarthoris had read of the existence of tribes of apes that seemed to be\r\nprogressing slowly toward higher standards of intelligence. Into the\r\nhands of such, he realized, he had fallen; but—what were their\r\nintentions toward him?\r\n\r\nAs he glanced about the courtyard, he saw fully fifty of the hideous\r\nbeasts, squatting on their haunches, and at a little distance from him\r\nanother human being, closely guarded.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes met those of his fellow-captive a smile lit the other’s\r\nface, and: “Kaor, red man!” burst from his lips. It was Kar Komak, the\r\nbowman.\r\n\r\n“Kaor!” cried Carthoris, in response. “How came you here, and what\r\nbefell the princess?”\r\n\r\n“Red men like yourself descended in mighty ships that sailed the air,\r\neven as the great ships of my distant day sailed the five seas,”\r\nreplied Kar Komak. “They fought with the green men of Torquas. They\r\nslew Komal, god of Lothar. I thought they were your friends, and I was\r\nglad when finally those of them who survived the battle carried the red\r\ngirl to one of the ships and sailed away with her into the safety of\r\nthe high air.\r\n\r\n“Then the green men seized me, and carried me to a great, empty city,\r\nwhere they chained me to a wall in a black pit. Afterward came these\r\nand dragged me hither. And what of you, red man?”\r\n\r\nCarthoris related all that had befallen him, and as the two men talked\r\nthe great apes squatted about them watching them intently.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do now?” asked the bowman.\r\n\r\n“Our case looks rather hopeless,” replied Carthoris ruefully. “These\r\ncreatures are born man-eaters. Why they have not already devoured us I\r\ncannot imagine—there!” he whispered. “See? The end is coming.”\r\n\r\nKar Komak looked in the direction Carthoris indicated to see a huge ape\r\nadvancing with a mighty bludgeon.\r\n\r\n“It is thus they like best to kill their prey,” said Carthoris.\r\n\r\n“Must we die without a struggle?” asked Kar Komak.\r\n\r\n“Not I,” replied Carthoris, “though I know how futile our best defence\r\nmust be against these mighty brutes! Oh, for a long-sword!”\r\n\r\n“Or a good bow,” added Kar Komak, “and a utan of bowmen.”\r\n\r\nAt the words Carthoris half sprang to his feet, only to be dragged\r\nroughly down by his guard.\r\n\r\n“Kar Komak!” he cried. “Why cannot you do what Tario and Jav did? They\r\nhad no bowmen other than those of their own creation. You must know the\r\nsecret of their power. Call forth your own utan, Kar Komak!”\r\n\r\nThe Lotharian looked at Carthoris in wide-eyed astonishment as the full\r\npurport of the suggestion bore in upon his understanding.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe savage ape bearing the mighty bludgeon was slinking toward\r\nCarthoris. The Heliumite’s fingers were working as he kept his eyes\r\nupon his executioner. Kar Komak bent his gaze penetratingly upon the\r\napes. The effort of his mind was evidenced in the sweat upon his\r\ncontracted brows.\r\n\r\nThe creature that was to slay the red man was almost within arm’s reach\r\nof his prey when Carthoris heard a hoarse shout from the opposite side\r\nof the courtyard. In common with the squatting apes and the demon with\r\nthe club he turned in the direction of the sound, to see a company of\r\nsturdy bowmen rushing from the doorway of a near-by building.\r\n\r\nWith screams of rage the apes leaped to their feet to meet the charge.\r\nA volley of arrows met them half-way, sending a dozen rolling lifeless\r\nto the ground. Then the apes closed with their adversaries. All their\r\nattention was occupied by the attackers—even the guard had deserted the\r\nprisoners to join in the battle.\r\n\r\n“Come!” whispered Kar Komak. “Now may we escape while their attention\r\nis diverted from us by my bowmen.”\r\n\r\n“And leave those brave fellows leaderless?” cried Carthoris, whose\r\nloyal nature revolted at the merest suggestion of such a thing.\r\n\r\nKar Komak laughed.\r\n\r\n“You forget,” he said, “that they are but thin air—figments of my\r\nbrain. They will vanish, unscathed, when we have no further need for\r\nthem. Praised be your first ancestor, redman, that you thought of this\r\nchance in time! It would never have occurred to me to imagine that I\r\nmight wield the same power that brought me into existence.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Carthoris. “Still, I hate to leave them, though\r\nthere is naught else to do,” and so the two turned from the courtyard,\r\nand making their way into one of the broad avenues, crept stealthily in\r\nthe shadows of the building toward the great central plaza upon which\r\nwere the buildings occupied by the green warriors when they visited the\r\ndeserted city.\r\n\r\nWhen they had come to the plaza’s edge Carthoris halted.\r\n\r\n“Wait here,” he whispered. “I go to fetch thoats, since on foot we may\r\nnever hope to escape the clutches of these green fiends.”\r\n\r\nTo reach the courtyard where the thoats were kept it was necessary for\r\nCarthoris to pass through one of the buildings which surrounded the\r\nsquare. Which were occupied and which not he could not even guess, so\r\nhe was compelled to take considerable chances to gain the enclosure in\r\nwhich he could hear the restless beasts squealing and quarrelling among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nChance carried him through a dark doorway into a large chamber in which\r\nlay a score or more green warriors wrapped in their sleeping silks and\r\nfurs. Scarce had Carthoris passed through the short hallway that\r\nconnected the door of the building and the great room beyond it than he\r\nbecame aware of the presence of something or some one in the hallway\r\nthrough which he had but just passed.\r\n\r\nHe heard a man yawn, and then, behind him, he saw the figure of a\r\nsentry rise from where the fellow had been dozing, and stretching\r\nhimself resume his wakeful watchfulness.\r\n\r\nCarthoris realized that he must have passed within a foot of the\r\nwarrior, doubtless rousing him from his slumber. To retreat now would\r\nbe impossible. Yet to cross through that roomful of sleeping warriors\r\nseemed almost equally beyond the pale of possibility.\r\n\r\nCarthoris shrugged his broad shoulders and chose the lesser evil.\r\nWarily he entered the room. At his right, against the wall, leaned\r\nseveral swords and rifles and spears—extra weapons which the warriors\r\nhad stacked here ready to their hands should there be a night alarm\r\ncalling them suddenly from slumber. Beside each sleeper lay his\r\nweapon—these were never far from their owners from childhood to death.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the swords made the young man’s palm itch. He stepped\r\nquickly to them, selecting two short-swords—one for Kar Komak, the\r\nother for himself; also some trappings for his naked comrade.\r\n\r\nThen he started directly across the centre of the apartment among the\r\nsleeping Torquasians.\r\n\r\nNot a man of them moved until Carthoris had completed more than half of\r\nthe short though dangerous journey. Then a fellow directly in his path\r\nturned restlessly upon his sleeping silks and furs.\r\n\r\nThe Heliumite paused above him, one of the short-swords in readiness\r\nshould the warrior awaken. For what seemed an eternity to the young\r\nprince the green man continued to move uneasily upon his couch, then,\r\nas though actuated by springs, he leaped to his feet and faced the red\r\nman.\r\n\r\nInstantly Carthoris struck, but not before a savage grunt escaped the\r\nother’s lips. In an instant the room was in turmoil. Warriors leaped to\r\ntheir feet, grasping their weapons as they rose, and shouting to one\r\nanother for an explanation of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nTo Carthoris all within the room was plainly visible in the dim light\r\nreflected from without, for the further moon stood directly at zenith;\r\nbut to the eyes of the newly-awakened green men objects as yet had not\r\ntaken on familiar forms—they but saw vaguely the figures of warriors\r\nmoving about their apartment.\r\n\r\nNow one stumbled against the corpse of him whom Carthoris had slain.\r\nThe fellow stooped and his hand came in contact with the cleft skull.\r\nHe saw about him the giant figures of other green men, and so he jumped\r\nto the only conclusion that was open to him.\r\n\r\n“The Thurds!” he cried. “The Thurds are upon us! Rise, warriors of\r\nTorquas, and drive home your swords within the hearts of Torquas’\r\nancient enemies!”\r\n\r\nInstantly the green men began to fall upon one another with naked\r\nswords. Their savage lust of battle was aroused. To fight, to kill, to\r\ndie with cold steel buried in their vitals! Ah, that to them was\r\nNirvana.\r\n\r\nCarthoris was quick to guess their error and take advantage of it. He\r\nknew that in the pleasure of killing they might fight on long after\r\nthey had discovered their mistake, unless their attention was\r\ndistracted by sight of the real cause of the altercation, and so he\r\nlost no time in continuing across the room to the doorway upon the\r\nopposite side, which opened into the inner court, where the savage\r\nthoats were squealing and fighting among themselves.\r\n\r\nOnce here he had no easy task before him. To catch and mount one of\r\nthese habitually rageful and intractable beasts was no child’s play\r\nunder the best of conditions; but now, when silence and time were such\r\nimportant considerations, it might well have seemed quite hopeless to a\r\nless resourceful and optimistic man than the son of the great warlord.\r\n\r\nFrom his father he had learned much concerning the traits of these\r\nmighty beasts, and from Tars Tarkas, also, when he had visited that\r\ngreat green jeddak among his horde at Thark. So now he centred upon the\r\nwork in hand all that he had ever learned about them from others and\r\nfrom his own experience, for he, too, had ridden and handled them many\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the thoats of Torquas appeared even shorter than their\r\nvicious cousins among the Tharks and Warhoons, and for a time it seemed\r\nunlikely that he should escape a savage charge on the part of a couple\r\nof old bulls that circled, squealing, about him; but at last he managed\r\nto get close enough to one of them to touch the beast. With the feel of\r\nhis hand upon the sleek hide the creature quieted, and in answer to the\r\ntelepathic command of the red man sank to its knees.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Carthoris was upon its back, guiding it toward the great\r\ngate that leads from the courtyard through a large building at one end\r\ninto an avenue beyond.\r\n\r\nThe other bull, still squealing and enraged, followed after his fellow.\r\nThere was no bridle upon either, for these strange creatures are\r\ncontrolled entirely by suggestion—when they are controlled at all.\r\n\r\nEven in the hands of the giant green men bridle reins would be\r\nhopelessly futile against the mad savagery and mastodonic strength of\r\nthe thoat, and so they are guided by that strange telepathic power with\r\nwhich the men of Mars have learned to communicate in a crude way with\r\nthe lower orders of their planet.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty Carthoris urged the two beasts to the gate, where,\r\nleaning down, he raised the latch. Then the thoat that he was riding\r\nplaced his great shoulder to the skeel-wood planking, pushed through,\r\nand a moment later the man and the two beasts were swinging silently\r\ndown the avenue to the edge of the plaza, where Kar Komak hid.\r\n\r\nHere Carthoris found considerable difficulty in subduing the second\r\nthoat, and as Kar Komak had never before ridden one of the beasts, it\r\nseemed a most hopeless job; but at last the bowman managed to scramble\r\nto the sleek back, and again the two beasts fled softly down the\r\nmoss-grown avenues toward the open sea-bottom beyond the city.\r\n\r\nAll that night and the following day and the second night they rode\r\ntoward the north-east. No indication of pursuit developed, and at dawn\r\nof the second day Carthoris saw in the distance the waving ribbon of\r\ngreat trees that marked one of the long Barsoomian water-ways.\r\n\r\nImmediately they abandoned their thoats and approached the cultivated\r\ndistrict on foot. Carthoris also discarded the metal from his harness,\r\nor such of it as might serve to identify him as a Heliumite, or of\r\nroyal blood, for he did not know to what nation belonged this waterway,\r\nand upon Mars it is always well to assume every man and nation your\r\nenemy until you have learned the contrary.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-forenoon when the two at last entered one of the roads that\r\ncut through the cultivated districts at regular intervals, joining the\r\narid wastes on either side with the great, white, central highway that\r\nfollows through the centre from end to end of the far-reaching,\r\nthreadlike farm lands.\r\n\r\nThe high wall surrounding the fields served as a protection against\r\nsurprise by raiding green hordes, as well as keeping the savage banths\r\nand other carnivora from the domestic animals and the human beings upon\r\nthe farms.\r\n\r\nCarthoris stopped before the first gate he came to, pounding for\r\nadmission. The young man who answered his summons greeted the two\r\nhospitably, though he looked with considerable wonder upon the white\r\nskin and auburn hair of the bowman.\r\n\r\nAfter he had listened for a moment to a partial narration of their\r\nescape from the Torquasians, he invited them within, took them to his\r\nhouse and bade the servants there prepare food for them.\r\n\r\nAs they waited in the low-ceiled, pleasant living room of the farmhouse\r\nuntil the meal should be ready, Carthoris drew his host into\r\nconversation that he might learn his nationality, and thus the nation\r\nunder whose dominion lay the waterway where circumstance had placed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I am Hal Vas,” said the young man, “son of Vas Kor, of Dusar, a noble\r\nin the retinue of Astok, Prince of Dusar. At present I am Dwar of the\r\nRoad for this district.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris was very glad that he had not disclosed his identity, for\r\nthough he had no idea of anything that had transpired since he had left\r\nHelium, or that Astok was at the bottom of all his misfortunes, he well\r\nknew that the Dusarian had no love for him, and that he could hope for\r\nno assistance within the dominions of Dusar.\r\n\r\n“And who are you?” asked Hal Vas. “By your appearance I take you for a\r\nfighting man, but I see no insignia upon your harness. Can it be that\r\nyou are a panthan?”\r\n\r\nNow, these wandering soldiers of fortune are common upon Barsoom, where\r\nmost men love to fight. They sell their services wherever war exists,\r\nand in the occasional brief intervals when there is no organized\r\nwarfare between the red nations, they join one of the numerous\r\nexpeditions that are constantly being dispatched against the green men\r\nin protection of the waterways that traverse the wilder portions of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nWhen their service is over they discard the metal of the nation they\r\nhave been serving until they shall have found a new master. In the\r\nintervals they wear no insignia, their war-worn harness and grim\r\nweapons being sufficient to attest their calling.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was a happy one, and Carthoris embraced the chance it\r\nafforded to account satisfactorily for himself. There was, however, a\r\nsingle drawback. In times of war such panthans as happened to be within\r\nthe domain of a belligerent nation were compelled to don the insignia\r\nof that nation and fight with her warriors.\r\n\r\nAs far as Carthoris knew Dusar was not at war with any other nation,\r\nbut there was never any telling when one red nation would be flying at\r\nthe throat of a neighbour, even though the great and powerful alliance\r\nat the head of which was his father, John Carter, had managed to\r\nmaintain a long peace upon the greater portion of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nA pleasant smile lighted Hal Vas’ face as Carthoris admitted his\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” exclaimed the young man, “that you chanced to come\r\nhither, for here you will find the means of obtaining service in short\r\norder. My father, Vas Kor, is even now with me, having come hither to\r\nrecruit a force for the new war against Helium.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTO SAVE DUSAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth, battling for more than life against the lust of Jav,\r\ncast a quick glance over her shoulder toward the forest from which had\r\nrumbled the fierce growl. Jav looked, too.\r\n\r\nWhat they saw filled each with apprehension. It was Komal, the\r\nbanth-god, rushing wide-jawed upon them!\r\n\r\nWhich had he chosen for his prey? Or was it to be both?\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait, for though the Lotharian attempted to hold\r\nthe girl between himself and the terrible fangs, the great beast found\r\nhim at last.\r\n\r\nThen, shrieking, he attempted to fly toward Lothar, after pushing\r\nThuvia bodily into the face of the man-eater. But his flight was of\r\nshort duration. In a moment Komal was upon him, rending his throat and\r\nchest with demoniacal fury.\r\n\r\nThe girl reached their side a moment later, but it was with difficulty\r\nthat she tore the mad beast from its prey. Still growling and casting\r\nhungry glances back upon Jav, the banth at last permitted itself to be\r\nled away into the wood.\r\n\r\nWith her giant protector by her side Thuvia set forth to find the\r\npassage through the cliffs, that she might attempt the seemingly\r\nimpossible feat of reaching far-distant Ptarth across the more than\r\nseventeen thousand haads of savage Barsoom.\r\n\r\nShe could not believe that Carthoris had deliberately deserted her, and\r\nso she kept a constant watch for him; but as she bore too far to the\r\nnorth in her search for the tunnel she passed the Heliumite as he was\r\nreturning to Lothar in search of her.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth was having difficulty in determining the exact status\r\nof the Prince of Helium in her heart. She could not admit even to\r\nherself that she loved him, and yet she had permitted him to apply to\r\nher that term of endearment and possession to which a Barsoomian maid\r\nshould turn deaf ears when voiced by other lips than those of her\r\nhusband or fiancé—“my princess.”\r\n\r\nKulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, to whom she was affianced, commanded her\r\nrespect and admiration. Had it been that she had surrendered to her\r\nfather’s wishes because of pique that the handsome Heliumite had not\r\ntaken advantage of his visits to her father’s court to push the suit\r\nfor her hand that she had been quite sure he had contemplated since\r\nthat distant day the two had sat together upon the carved seat within\r\nthe gorgeous Garden of the Jeddaks that graced the inner courtyard of\r\nthe palace of Salensus Oll at Kadabra?\r\n\r\nDid she love Kulan Tith? Bravely she tried to believe that she did; but\r\nall the while her eyes wandered through the coming darkness for the\r\nfigure of a clean-limbed fighting man—black-haired and grey-eyed. Black\r\nwas the hair of Kulan Tith; but his eyes were brown.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark when she found the entrance to the tunnel. Safely\r\nshe passed through to the hills beyond, and here, under the bright\r\nlight of Mars’ two moons, she halted to plan her future action.\r\n\r\nShould she wait here in the hope that Carthoris would return in search\r\nof her? Or should she continue her way north-east toward Ptarth? Where,\r\nfirst, would Carthoris have gone after leaving the valley of Lothar?\r\n\r\nHer parched throat and dry tongue gave her the answer—toward Aaanthor\r\nand water. Well, she, too, would go first to Aaanthor, where she might\r\nfind more than the water she needed.\r\n\r\nWith Komal by her side she felt little fear, for he would protect her\r\nfrom all other savage beasts. Even the great white apes would flee the\r\nmighty banth in terror. Men only need she fear, but she must take this\r\nand many other chances before she could hope to reach her father’s\r\ncourt again.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Carthoris found her, only to be struck down by the\r\nlong-sword of a green man, Thuvia prayed that the same fate might\r\novertake her.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the red warriors leaping from their fliers had, for a\r\nmoment, filled her with renewed hope—hope that Carthoris of Helium\r\nmight be only stunned and that they would rescue him; but when she saw\r\nthe Dusarian metal upon their harness, and that they sought only to\r\nescape with her alone from the charging Torquasians, she gave up.\r\n\r\nKomal, too, was dead—dead across the body of the Heliumite. She was,\r\nindeed, alone now. There was none to protect her.\r\n\r\nThe Dusarian warriors dragged her to the deck of the nearest flier. All\r\nabout them the green warriors surged in an attempt to wrest her from\r\nthe red.\r\n\r\nAt last those who had not died in the conflict gained the decks of the\r\ntwo craft. The engines throbbed and purred—the propellers whirred.\r\nQuickly the swift boats shot heavenward.\r\n\r\nThuvia of Ptarth glanced about her. A man stood near, smiling down into\r\nher face. With a gasp of recognition she looked full into his eyes, and\r\nthen with a little moan of terror and understanding she buried her face\r\nin her hands and sank to the polished skeel-wood deck. It was Astok,\r\nPrince of Dusar, who bent above her.\r\n\r\nSwift were the fliers of Astok of Dusar, and great the need for\r\nreaching his father’s court as quickly as possible, for the fleets of\r\nwar of Helium and Ptarth and Kaol were scattered far and wide above\r\nBarsoom. Nor would it go well with Astok of Dusar should any one of\r\nthem discover Thuvia of Ptarth a prisoner upon his own vessel.\r\n\r\nAaanthor lies in fifty south latitude, and forty east of Horz, the\r\ndeserted seat of ancient Barsoomian culture and learning, while Dusar\r\nlies fifteen degrees north of the equator and twenty degrees east from\r\nHorz.\r\n\r\nGreat though the distance is, the fliers covered it without a stop.\r\nLong before they had reached their destination Thuvia of Ptarth had\r\nlearned several things that cleared up the doubts that had assailed her\r\nmind for many days. Scarce had they risen above Aaanthor than she\r\nrecognized one of the crew as a member of the crew of that other flier\r\nthat had borne her from her father’s gardens to Aaanthor. The presence\r\nof Astok upon the craft settled the whole question. She had been stolen\r\nby emissaries of the Dusarian prince—Carthoris of Helium had had\r\nnothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nNor did Astok deny the charge when she accused him. He only smiled and\r\npleaded his love for her.\r\n\r\n“I would sooner mate with a white ape!” she cried, when he would have\r\nurged his suit.\r\n\r\nAstok glowered sullenly upon her.\r\n\r\n“You shall mate with me, Thuvia of Ptarth,” he growled, “or, by your\r\nfirst ancestor, you shall have your preference—and mate with a white\r\nape.”\r\n\r\nThe girl made no reply, nor could he draw her into conversation during\r\nthe balance of the journey.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Astok was a trifle awed by the proportions of the\r\nconflict which his abduction of the Ptarthian princess had induced, nor\r\nwas he over comfortable with the weight of responsibility which the\r\npossession of such a prisoner entailed.\r\n\r\nHis one thought was to get her to Dusar, and there let his father\r\nassume the responsibility. In the meantime he would be as careful as\r\npossible to do nothing to affront her, lest they all might be captured\r\nand he have to account for his treatment of the girl to one of the\r\ngreat jeddaks whose interest centred in her.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last they came to Dusar, where Astok hid his prisoner in a\r\nsecret room high in the east tower of his own palace. He had sworn his\r\nmen to silence in the matter of the identity of the girl, for until he\r\nhad seen his father, Nutus, Jeddak of Dusar, he dared not let any one\r\nknow whom he had brought with him from the south.\r\n\r\nBut when he appeared in the great audience chamber before the\r\ncruel-lipped man who was his sire, he found his courage oozing, and he\r\ndared not speak of the princess hid within his palace. It occurred to\r\nhim to test his father’s sentiments upon the subject, and so he told a\r\ntale of capturing one who claimed to know the whereabouts of Thuvia of\r\nPtarth.\r\n\r\n“And if you command it, Sire,” he said, “I will go and capture\r\nher—fetching her here to Dusar.”\r\n\r\nNutus frowned and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“You have done enough already to set Ptarth and Kaol and Helium all\r\nthree upon us at once should they learn your part in the theft of the\r\nPtarth princess. That you succeeded in shifting the guilt upon the\r\nPrince of Helium was fortunate, and a masterly move of strategy; but\r\nwere the girl to know the truth and ever return to her father’s court,\r\nall Dusar would have to pay the penalty, and to have her here a\r\nprisoner amongst us would be an admission of guilt from the\r\nconsequences of which naught could save us. It would cost me my throne,\r\nAstok, and that I have no mind to lose.\r\n\r\n“If we had her here—” the elder man suddenly commenced to muse,\r\nrepeating the phrase again and again. “If we had her here, Astok,” he\r\nexclaimed fiercely. “Ah, if we but had her here and none knew that she\r\nwas here! Can you not guess, man? The guilt of Dusar might be for ever\r\nburied with her bones,” he concluded in a low, savage whisper.\r\n\r\nAstok, Prince of Dusar, shuddered.\r\n\r\nWeak he was; yes, and wicked, too; but the suggestion that his father’s\r\nwords implied turned him cold with horror.\r\n\r\nCruel to their enemies are the men of Mars; but the word “enemies” is\r\ncommonly interpreted to mean men only. Assassination runs riot in the\r\ngreat Barsoomian cities; yet to murder a woman is a crime so\r\nunthinkable that even the most hardened of the paid assassins would\r\nshrink from you in horror should you suggest such a thing to him.\r\n\r\nNutus was apparently oblivious to his son’s all-too-patent terror at\r\nhis suggestion. Presently he continued:\r\n\r\n“You say that you know where the girl lies hid, since she was stolen\r\nfrom your people at Aaanthor. Should she be found by any one of the\r\nthree powers, her unsupported story would be sufficient to turn them\r\nall against us.\r\n\r\n“There is but one way, Astok,” cried the older man. “You must return at\r\nonce to her hiding-place and fetch her hither in all secrecy. And, look\r\nyou here! Return not to Dusar without her, upon pain of death!”\r\n\r\nAstok, Prince of Dusar, well knew his royal father’s temper. He knew\r\nthat in the tyrant’s heart there pulsed no single throb of love for any\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nAstok’s mother had been a slave woman. Nutus had never loved her. He\r\nhad never loved another. In youth he had tried to find a bride at the\r\ncourts of several of his powerful neighbours, but their women would\r\nhave none of him.\r\n\r\nAfter a dozen daughters of his own nobility had sought self-destruction\r\nrather than wed him he had given up. And then it had been that he had\r\nlegally wed one of his slaves that he might have a son to stand among\r\nthe jeds when Nutus died and a new jeddak was chosen.\r\n\r\nSlowly Astok withdrew from the presence of his father. With white face\r\nand shaking limbs he made his way to his own palace. As he crossed the\r\ncourtyard his glance chanced to wander to the great east tower looming\r\nhigh against the azure of the sky.\r\n\r\nAt sight of it beads of sweat broke out upon his brow.\r\n\r\nIssus! No other hand than his could be trusted to do the horrid thing.\r\nWith his own fingers he must crush the life from that perfect throat,\r\nor plunge the silent blade into the red, red heart.\r\n\r\nHer heart! The heart that he had hoped would brim with love for him!\r\n\r\nBut had it done so? He recalled the haughty contempt with which his\r\nprotestations of love had been received. He went cold and then hot to\r\nthe memory of it. His compunctions cooled as the self-satisfaction of a\r\nnear revenge crowded out the finer instincts that had for a moment\r\nasserted themselves—the good that he had inherited from the slave woman\r\nwas once again submerged in the bad blood that had come down to him\r\nfrom his royal sire; as, in the end, it always was.\r\n\r\nA cold smile supplanted the terror that had dilated his eyes. He turned\r\nhis steps toward the tower. He would see her before he set out upon the\r\njourney that was to blind his father to the fact that the girl was\r\nalready in Dusar.\r\n\r\nQuietly he passed in through the secret way, ascending a spiral runway\r\nto the apartment in which the Princess of Ptarth was immured.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the room he saw the girl leaning upon the sill of the\r\neast casement, gazing out across the roof tops of Dusar toward distant\r\nPtarth. He hated Ptarth. The thought of it filled him with rage. Why\r\nnot finish her now and have it done with?\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his step she turned quickly toward him. Ah, how\r\nbeautiful she was! His sudden determination faded beneath the glorious\r\nlight of her wondrous beauty. He would wait until he had returned from\r\nhis little journey of deception—maybe there might be some other way\r\nthen. Some other hand to strike the blow—with that face, with those\r\neyes before him, he could never do it. Of that he was positive. He had\r\nalways gloried in the cruelty of his nature, but, Issus! he was not\r\nthat cruel. No, another must be found—one whom he could trust.\r\n\r\nHe was still looking at her as she stood there before him meeting his\r\ngaze steadily and unafraid. He felt the hot passion of his love\r\nmounting higher and higher.\r\n\r\nWhy not sue once more? If she would relent, all might yet be well. Even\r\nif his father could not be persuaded, they could fly to Ptarth, laying\r\nall the blame of the knavery and intrigue that had thrown four great\r\nnations into war, upon the shoulders of Nutus. And who was there that\r\nwould doubt the justice of the charge?\r\n\r\n“Thuvia,” he said, “I come once again, for the last time, to lay my\r\nheart at your feet. Ptarth and Kaol and Dusar are battling with Helium\r\nbecause of you. Wed me, Thuvia, and all may yet be as it should be.”\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” he commanded, before she could speak. “Know the truth before\r\nyou speak words that may seal, not only your own fate, but that of the\r\nthousands of warriors who battle because of you.\r\n\r\n“Refuse to wed me willingly, and Dusar would be laid waste should ever\r\nthe truth be known to Ptarth and Kaol and Helium. They would raze our\r\ncities, leaving not one stone upon another. They would scatter our\r\npeoples across the face of Barsoom from the frozen north to the frozen\r\nsouth, hunting them down and slaying them, until this great nation\r\nremained only as a hated memory in the minds of men.\r\n\r\n“But while they are exterminating the Dusarians, countless thousands of\r\ntheir own warriors must perish—and all because of the stubbornness of a\r\nsingle woman who would not wed the prince who loves her.\r\n\r\n“Refuse, Thuvia of Ptarth, and there remains but a single\r\nalternative—no man must ever know your fate. Only a handful of loyal\r\nservitors besides my royal father and myself know that you were stolen\r\nfrom the gardens of Thuvan Dihn by Astok, Prince of Dusar, or that\r\nto-day you be imprisoned in my palace.\r\n\r\n“Refuse, Thuvia of Ptarth, and you must die to save Dusar—there is no\r\nother way. Nutus, the jeddak, has so decreed. I have spoken.”\r\n\r\nFor a long moment the girl let her level gaze rest full upon the face\r\nof Astok of Dusar. Then she spoke, and though the words were few, the\r\nunimpassioned tone carried unfathomable depths of cold contempt.\r\n\r\n“Better all that you have threatened,” she said, “than you.”\r\n\r\nThen she turned her back upon him and went to stand once more before\r\nthe east window, gazing with sad eyes toward distant Ptarth.\r\n\r\nAstok wheeled and left the room, returning after a short interval of\r\ntime with food and drink.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he said, “is sustenance until I return again. The next to enter\r\nthis apartment will be your executioner. Commend yourself to your\r\nancestors, Thuvia of Ptarth, for within a few days you shall be with\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nThen he was gone.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later he was interviewing an officer high in the navy of\r\nDusar.\r\n\r\n“Whither went Vas Kor?” he asked. “He is not at his palace.”\r\n\r\n“South, to the great waterway that skirts Torquas,” replied the other.\r\n“His son, Hal Vas, is Dwar of the Road there, and thither has Vas Kor\r\ngone to enlist recruits among the workers on the farms.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Astok, and a half-hour more found him rising above Dusar\r\nin his swiftest flier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nTURJUN, THE PANTHAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe face of Carthoris of Helium gave no token of the emotions that\r\nconvulsed him inwardly as he heard from the lips of Hal Vas that Helium\r\nwas at war with Dusar, and that fate had thrown him into the service of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThat he might utilize this opportunity to the good of Helium scarce\r\nsufficed to outweigh the chagrin he felt that he was not fighting in\r\nthe open at the head of his own loyal troops.\r\n\r\nTo escape the Dusarians might prove an easy matter; and then again it\r\nmight not. Should they suspect his loyalty (and the loyalty of an\r\nimpressed panthan was always open to suspicion), he might not find an\r\nopportunity to elude their vigilance until after the termination of the\r\nwar, which might occur within days, or, again, only after long and\r\nweary years of bloodshed.\r\n\r\nHe recalled that history recorded wars in which actual military\r\noperations had been carried on without cessation for five or six\r\nhundred years, and even now there were nations upon Barsoom with which\r\nHelium had made no peace within the history of man.\r\n\r\nThe outlook was not cheering. He could not guess that within a few\r\nhours he would be blessing the fate that had thrown him into the\r\nservice of Dusar.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Hal Vas. “Here is my father now. Kaor! Vas Kor. Here is\r\none you will be glad to meet—a doughty panthan—” He hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Turjun,” interjected Carthoris, seizing upon the first appellation\r\nthat occurred to him.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke his eyes crossed quickly to the tall warrior who was\r\nentering the room. Where before had he seen that giant figure, that\r\ntaciturn countenance, and the livid sword-cut from temple to mouth?\r\n\r\n“Vas Kor,” repeated Carthoris mentally. “Vas Kor!” Where had he seen\r\nthe man before?\r\n\r\nAnd then the noble spoke, and like a flash it all came back to\r\nCarthoris—the forward servant upon the landing stage at Ptarth that\r\ntime that he had been explaining the intricacies of his new compass to\r\nThuvan Dihn; the lone slave that had guarded his own hangar that night\r\nhe had left upon his ill-fated journey for Ptarth—the journey that had\r\nbrought him so mysteriously to far Aaanthor.\r\n\r\n“Vas Kor,” he repeated aloud, “blessed be your ancestors for this\r\nmeeting,” nor did the Dusarian guess the wealth of meaning that lay\r\nbeneath that hackneyed phrase with which a Barsoomian acknowledges an\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n“And blessed be yours, Turjun,” replied Vas Kor.\r\n\r\nNow came the introduction of Kar Komak to Vas Kor, and as Carthoris\r\nwent through the little ceremony there came to him the only explanation\r\nhe might make to account for the white skin and auburn hair of the\r\nbowman; for he feared that the truth might not be believed and thus\r\nsuspicion be cast upon them both from the beginning.\r\n\r\n“Kar Komak,” he explained, “is, as you can see, a thern. He has\r\nwandered far from his icebound southern temples in search of adventure.\r\nI came upon him in the pits of Aaanthor; but though I have known him so\r\nshort a time, I can vouch for his bravery and loyalty.”\r\n\r\nSince the destruction of the fabric of their false religion by John\r\nCarter, the majority of the therns had gladly accepted the new order of\r\nthings, so that it was now no longer uncommon to see them mingling with\r\nthe multitudes of red men in any of the great cities of the outer\r\nworld, so Vas Kor neither felt nor expressed any great astonishment.\r\n\r\nAll during the interview Carthoris watched, catlike, for some\r\nindication that Vas Kor recognized in the battered panthan the\r\nerstwhile gorgeous Prince of Helium; but the sleepless nights, the long\r\ndays of marching and fighting, the wounds and the dried blood had\r\nevidently sufficed to obliterate the last remnant of his likeness to\r\nhis former self; and then Vas Kor had seen him but twice in all his\r\nlife. Little wonder that he did not know him.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening Vas Kor announced that on the morrow they should\r\ndepart north toward Dusar, picking up recruits at various stations\r\nalong the way.\r\n\r\nIn a great field behind the house a flier lay—a fair-sized\r\ncruiser-transport that would accommodate many men, yet swift and well\r\narmed also. Here Carthoris slept, and Kar Komak, too, with the other\r\nrecruits, under guard of the regular Dusarian warriors that manned the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nToward midnight Vas Kor returned to the vessel from his son’s house,\r\nrepairing at once to his cabin. Carthoris, with one of the Dusarians,\r\nwas on watch. It was with difficulty that the Heliumite repressed a\r\ncold smile as the noble passed within a foot of him—within a foot of\r\nthe long, slim, Heliumitic blade that swung in his harness.\r\n\r\nHow easy it would have been! How easy to avenge the cowardly trick that\r\nhad been played upon him—to avenge Helium and Ptarth and Thuvia!\r\n\r\nBut his hand moved not toward the dagger’s hilt, for first Vas Kor must\r\nserve a better purpose—he might know where Thuvia of Ptarth lay hidden\r\nnow, if it had truly been Dusarians that had spirited her away during\r\nthe fight before Aaanthor.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, there was the instigator of the entire foul plot. HE\r\nmust pay the penalty; and who better than Vas Kor could lead the Prince\r\nof Helium to Astok of Dusar?\r\n\r\nFaintly out of the night there came to Carthoris’s ears the purring of\r\na distant motor. He scanned the heavens.\r\n\r\nYes, there it was far in the north, dimly outlined against the dark\r\nvoid of space that stretched illimitably beyond it, the faint\r\nsuggestion of a flier passing, unlighted, through the Barsoomian night.\r\n\r\nCarthoris, knowing not whether the craft might be friend or foe of\r\nDusar, gave no sign that he had seen, but turned his eyes in another\r\ndirection, leaving the matter to the Dusarian who stood watch with him.\r\n\r\nPresently the fellow discovered the oncoming craft, and sounded the low\r\nalarm which brought the balance of the watch and an officer from their\r\nsleeping silks and furs upon the deck near by.\r\n\r\nThe cruiser-transport lay without lights, and, resting as she was upon\r\nthe ground, must have been entirely invisible to the oncoming flier,\r\nwhich all presently recognized as a small craft.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that the stranger intended making a landing, for\r\nshe was now spiraling slowly above them, dropping lower and lower in\r\neach graceful curve.\r\n\r\n“It is the _Thuria_,” whispered one of the Dusarian warriors. “I would\r\nknow her in the blackness of the pits among ten thousand other craft.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are!” exclaimed Vas Kor, who had come on deck. And then he\r\nhailed:\r\n\r\n“Kaor, _Thuria_!”\r\n\r\n“Kaor!” came presently from above after a brief silence. Then: “What\r\nship?”\r\n\r\n“Cruiser-transport Kalksus, Vas Kor of Dusar.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” came from above. “Is there safe landing alongside?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, close in to starboard. Wait, we will show our lights,” and a\r\nmoment later the smaller craft settled close beside the Kalksus, and\r\nthe lights of the latter were immediately extinguished once more.\r\n\r\nSeveral figures could be seen slipping over the side of the _Thuria_\r\nand advancing toward the Kalksus. Ever suspicious, the Dusarians stood\r\nready to receive the visitors as friends or foes as closer inspection\r\nmight prove them. Carthoris stood quite near the rail, ready to take\r\nsides with the new-comers should chance have it that they were\r\nHeliumites playing a bold stroke of strategy upon this lone Dusarian\r\nship. He had led like parties himself, and knew that such a contingency\r\nwas quite possible.\r\n\r\nBut the face of the first man to cross the rail undeceived him with a\r\nshock that was not at all unpleasurable—it was the face of Astok,\r\nPrince of Dusar.\r\n\r\nScarce noticing the others upon the deck of the Kalksus, Astok strode\r\nforward to accept Vas Kor’s greeting, then he summoned the noble below.\r\nThe warriors and officers returned to their sleeping silks and furs,\r\nand once more the deck was deserted except for the Dusarian warrior and\r\nTurjun, the panthan, who stood guard.\r\n\r\nThe latter walked quietly to and fro. The former leaned across the\r\nrail, wishing for the hour that would bring him relief. He did not see\r\nhis companion approach the lights of the cabin of Vas Kor. He did not\r\nsee him stoop with ear close pressed to a tiny ventilator.\r\n\r\n“May the white apes take us all,” cried Astok ruefully, “if we are not\r\nin as ugly a snarl as you have ever seen! Nutus thinks that we have her\r\nin hiding far away from Dusar. He has bidden me bring her here.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. No man should have heard from his lips the thing he was\r\ntrying to tell. It should have been for ever the secret of Nutus and\r\nAstok, for upon it rested the safety of a throne. With that knowledge\r\nany man could wrest from the Jeddak of Dusar whatever he listed.\r\n\r\nBut Astok was afraid, and he wanted from this older man the suggestion\r\nof an alternative. He went on.\r\n\r\n“I am to kill her,” he whispered, looking fearfully around. “Nutus\r\nmerely wishes to see the body that he may know his commands have been\r\nexecuted. I am now supposed to be gone to the spot where we have her\r\nhidden that I may fetch her in secrecy to Dusar. None is to know that\r\nshe has ever been in the keeping of a Dusarian. I do not need to tell\r\nyou what would befall Dusar should Ptarth and Helium and Kaol ever\r\nlearn the truth.”\r\n\r\nThe jaws of the listener at the ventilator clicked together with a\r\nvicious snap. Before he had but guessed at the identity of the subject\r\nof this conversation. Now he knew. And they were to kill her! His\r\nmuscular fingers clenched until the nails bit into the palms.\r\n\r\n“And you wish me to go with you while you fetch her to Dusar,” Vas Kor\r\nwas saying. “Where is she?”\r\n\r\nAstok bent close and whispered into the other’s ear. The suggestion of\r\na smile crossed the cruel features of Vas Kor. He realized the power\r\nthat lay within his grasp. He should be a jed at least.\r\n\r\n“And how may I help you, my Prince?” asked the older man suavely.\r\n\r\n“I cannot kill her,” said Astok. “Issus! I cannot do it! When she turns\r\nthose eyes upon me my heart becomes water.”\r\n\r\nVas Kor’s eyes narrowed.\r\n\r\n“And you wish—” He paused, the interrogation unfinished, yet complete.\r\n\r\nAstok nodded.\r\n\r\n“_You_ do not love her,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But I love my life—though I am only a lesser noble,” he concluded\r\nmeaningly.\r\n\r\n“You shall be a greater noble—a noble of the first rank!” exclaimed\r\nAstok.\r\n\r\n“I would be a jed,” said Vas Kor bluntly.\r\n\r\nAstok hesitated.\r\n\r\n“A jed must die before there can be another jed,” he pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Jeds have died before,” snapped Vas Kor. “It would doubtless be not\r\ndifficult for you to find a jed you do not love, Astok—there are many\r\nwho do not love you.”\r\n\r\nAlready Vas Kor was commencing to presume upon his power over the young\r\nprince. Astok was quick to note and appreciate the subtle change in his\r\nlieutenant. A cunning scheme entered his weak and wicked brain.\r\n\r\n“As you say, Vas Kor!” he exclaimed. “You shall be a jed when the thing\r\nis done,” and then, to himself: “Nor will it then be difficult for me\r\nto find a jed I do not love.”\r\n\r\n“When shall we return to Dusar?” asked the noble.\r\n\r\n“At once,” replied Astok. “Let us get under way now—there is naught to\r\nkeep you here?”\r\n\r\n“I had intended sailing on the morrow, picking up such recruits as the\r\nvarious Dwars of the Roads might have collected for me, as we returned\r\nto Dusar.”\r\n\r\n“Let the recruits wait,” said Astok. “Or, better still, come you to\r\nDusar upon the _Thuria_, leaving the Kalksus to follow and pick up the\r\nrecruits.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” acquiesced Vas Kor; “that is the better plan. Come; I am ready,”\r\nand he rose to accompany Astok to the latter’s flier.\r\n\r\nThe listener at the ventilator came to his feet slowly, like an old\r\nman. His face was drawn and pinched and very white beneath the light\r\ncopper of his skin. She was to die! And he helpless to avert the\r\ntragedy. He did not even know where she was imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe two men were ascending from the cabin to the deck. Turjun, the\r\npanthan, crept close to the companionway, his sinuous fingers closing\r\ntightly upon the hilt of his dagger. Could he despatch them both before\r\nhe was overpowered? He smiled. He could slay an entire utan of her\r\nenemies in his present state of mind.\r\n\r\nThey were almost abreast of him now. Astok was speaking.\r\n\r\n“Bring a couple of your men along, Vas Kor,” he said. “We are\r\nshort-handed upon the _Thuria_, so quickly did we depart.”\r\n\r\nThe panthan’s fingers dropped from the dagger’s hilt. His quick mind\r\nhad grasped here a chance for succouring Thuvia of Ptarth. He might be\r\nchosen as one to accompany the assassins, and once he had learned where\r\nthe captive lay he could dispatch Astok and Vas Kor as well as now. To\r\nkill them before he knew where Thuvia was hid was simply to leave her\r\nto death at the hands of others; for sooner or later Nutus would learn\r\nher whereabouts, and Nutus, Jeddak of Dusar, could not afford to let\r\nher live.\r\n\r\nTurjun put himself in the path of Vas Kor that he might not be\r\noverlooked. The noble aroused the men sleeping upon the deck, but\r\nalways before him the strange panthan whom he had recruited that same\r\nday found means for keeping himself to the fore.\r\n\r\nVas Kor turned to his lieutenant, giving instruction for the bringing\r\nof the Kalksus to Dusar, and the gathering up of the recruits; then he\r\nsigned to two warriors who stood close behind the padwar.\r\n\r\n“You two accompany us to the _Thuria_,” he said, “and put yourselves at\r\nthe disposal of her dwar.”\r\n\r\nIt was dark upon the deck of the Kalksus, so Vas Kor had not a good\r\nlook at the faces of the two he chose; but that was of no moment, for\r\nthey were but common warriors to assist with the ordinary duties upon a\r\nflier, and to fight if need be.\r\n\r\nOne of the two was Kar Komak, the bowman. The other was not Carthoris.\r\n\r\nThe Heliumite was mad with disappointment. He snatched his dagger from\r\nhis harness; but already Astok had left the deck of the Kalksus, and he\r\nknew that before he could overtake him, should he dispatch Vas Kor, he\r\nwould be killed by the Dusarian warriors, who now were thick upon the\r\ndeck. With either one of the two alive Thuvia was in as great danger as\r\nthough both lived—it must be both!\r\n\r\nAs Vas Kor descended to the ground Carthoris boldly followed him, nor\r\ndid any attempt to halt him, thinking, doubtless, that he was one of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nAfter him came Kar Komak and the Dusarian warrior who had been detailed\r\nto duty upon the _Thuria_. Carthoris walked close to the left side of\r\nthe latter. Now they came to the dense shadow under the side of the\r\n_Thuria_. It was very dark there, so that they had to grope for the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nKar Komak preceded the Dusarian. The latter reached upward for the\r\nswinging rounds, and as he did so steel fingers closed upon his\r\nwindpipe and a steel blade pierced the very centre of his heart.\r\n\r\nTurjun, the panthan, was the last to clamber over the rail of the\r\n_Thuria_, drawing the rope ladder in after him.\r\n\r\nA moment later the flier was rising rapidly, headed for the north.\r\n\r\nAt the rail Kar Komak turned to speak to the warrior who had been\r\ndetailed to accompany him. His eyes went wide as they rested upon the\r\nface of the young man whom he had met beside the granite cliffs that\r\nguard mysterious Lothar. How had he come in place of the Dusarian?\r\n\r\nA quick sign, and Kar Komak turned once more to find the _Thuria_’s\r\ndwar that he might report himself for duty. Behind him followed the\r\npanthan.\r\n\r\nCarthoris blessed the chance that had caused Vas Kor to choose the\r\nbowman of all others, for had it been another Dusarian there would have\r\nbeen questions to answer as to the whereabouts of the warrior who lay\r\nso quietly in the field beyond the residence of Hal Vas, Dwar of the\r\nSouthern Road; and Carthoris had no answer to that question other than\r\nhis sword point, which alone was scarce adequate to convince the entire\r\ncrew of the _Thuria_.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Dusar seemed interminable to the impatient Carthoris,\r\nthough as a matter of fact it was quickly accomplished. Some time\r\nbefore they reached their destination they met and spoke with another\r\nDusarian war flier. From it they learned that a great battle was soon\r\nto be fought south-east of Dusar.\r\n\r\nThe combined navies of Dusar, Ptarth and Kaol had been intercepted in\r\ntheir advance toward Helium by the mighty Heliumitic navy—the most\r\nformidable upon Barsoom, not alone in numbers and armament, but in the\r\ntraining and courage of its officers and warriors, and the zitidaric\r\nproportions of many of its monster battleships.\r\n\r\nNot for many a day had there been the promise of such a battle. Four\r\njeddaks were in direct command of their own fleets—Kulan Tith of Kaol,\r\nThuvan Dihn of Ptarth, and Nutus of Dusar upon one side; while upon the\r\nother was Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium. With the latter was John\r\nCarter, Warlord of Mars.\r\n\r\nFrom the far north another force was moving south across the barrier\r\ncliffs—the new navy of Talu, Jeddak of Okar, coming in response to the\r\ncall from the warlord. Upon the decks of the sullen ships of war\r\nblack-bearded yellow men looked over eagerly toward the south. Gorgeous\r\nwere they in their splendid cloaks of orluk and apt. Fierce, formidable\r\nfighters from the hothouse cities of the frozen north.\r\n\r\nAnd from the distant south, from the sea of Omean and the cliffs of\r\ngold, from the temples of the therns and the garden of Issus, other\r\nthousands sailed into the north at the call of the great man they all\r\nhad learned to respect, and, respecting, love. Pacing the flagship of\r\nthis mighty fleet, second only to the navy of Helium, was the ebon\r\nXodar, Jeddak of the First Born, his heart beating strong in\r\nanticipation of the coming moment when he should hurl his savage crews\r\nand the weight of his mighty ships upon the enemies of the warlord.\r\n\r\nBut would these allies reach the theatre of war in time to be of avail\r\nto Helium? Or, would Helium need them?\r\n\r\nCarthoris, with the other members of the crew of the _Thuria_, heard\r\nthe gossip and the rumours. None knew of the two fleets, the one from\r\nthe south and the other from the north, that were coming to support the\r\nships of Helium, and all of Dusar were convinced that nothing now could\r\nsave the ancient power of Helium from being wiped for ever from the\r\nupper air of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nCarthoris, too, loyal son of Helium that he was, felt that even his\r\nbeloved navy might not be able to cope successfully with the combined\r\nforces of three great powers.\r\n\r\nNow the _Thuria_ touched the landing stage above the palace of Astok.\r\nHurriedly the prince and Vas Kor disembarked and entered the drop that\r\nwould carry them to the lower levels of the palace.\r\n\r\nClose beside it was another drop that was utilized by common warriors.\r\nCarthoris touched Kar Komak upon the arm.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he whispered. “You are my only friend among a nation of\r\nenemies. Will you stand by me?”\r\n\r\n“To the death,” replied Kar Komak.\r\n\r\nThe two approached the drop. A slave operated it.\r\n\r\n“Where are your passes?” he asked.\r\n\r\nCarthoris fumbled in his pocket pouch as though in search of them, at\r\nthe same time entering the cage. Kar Komak followed him, closing the\r\ndoor. The slave did not start the cage downward. Every second counted.\r\nThey must reach the lower level as soon as possible after Astok and Vas\r\nKor if they would know whither the two went.\r\n\r\nCarthoris turned suddenly upon the slave, hurling him to the opposite\r\nside of the cage.\r\n\r\n“Bind and gag him, Kar Komak!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThen he grasped the control lever, and as the cage shot downward at\r\nsickening speed, the bowman grappled with the slave. Carthoris could\r\nnot leave the control to assist his companion, for should they touch\r\nthe lowest level at the speed at which they were going, all would be\r\ndashed to instant death.\r\n\r\nBelow him he could now see the top of Astok’s cage in the parallel\r\nshaft, and he reduced the speed of his to that of the other. The slave\r\ncommenced to scream.\r\n\r\n“Silence him!” cried Carthoris.\r\n\r\nA moment later a limp form crumpled to the floor of the cage.\r\n\r\n“He is silenced,” said Kar Komak.\r\n\r\nCarthoris brought the cage to a sudden stop at one of the higher levels\r\nof the palace. Opening the door, he grasped the still form of the slave\r\nand pushed it out upon the floor. Then he banged the gate and resumed\r\nthe downward drop.\r\n\r\nOnce more he sighted the top of the cage that held Astok and Vas Kor.\r\nAn instant later it had stopped, and as he brought his car to a halt,\r\nhe saw the two men disappear through one of the exits of the corridor\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nKULAN TITH’S SACRIFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of the second day of her incarceration in the east tower of\r\nthe palace of Astok, Prince of Dusar, found Thuvia of Ptarth waiting in\r\ndull apathy the coming of the assassin.\r\n\r\nShe had exhausted every possibility of escape, going over and over\r\nagain the door and the windows, the floor and the walls.\r\n\r\nThe solid ersite slabs she could not even scratch; the tough Barsoomian\r\nglass of the windows would have shattered to nothing less than a heavy\r\nsledge in the hands of a strong man. The door and the lock were\r\nimpregnable. There was no escape. And they had stripped her of her\r\nweapons so that she could not even anticipate the hour of her doom,\r\nthus robbing them of the satisfaction of witnessing her last moments.\r\n\r\nWhen would they come? Would Astok do the deed with his own hands? She\r\ndoubted that he had the courage for it. At heart he was a coward—she\r\nhad known it since first she had heard him brag as, a visitor at the\r\ncourt of her father, he had sought to impress her with his valour.\r\n\r\nShe could not help but compare him with another. And with whom would an\r\naffianced bride compare an unsuccessful suitor? With her betrothed? And\r\ndid Thuvia of Ptarth now measure Astok of Dusar by the standards of\r\nKulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol?\r\n\r\nShe was about to die; her thoughts were her own to do with as she\r\npleased; yet furthest from them was Kulan Tith. Instead the figure of\r\nthe tall and comely Heliumite filled her mind, crowding therefrom all\r\nother images.\r\n\r\nShe dreamed of his noble face, the quiet dignity of his bearing, the\r\nsmile that lit his eyes as he conversed with his friends, and the smile\r\nthat touched his lips as he fought with his enemies—the fighting smile\r\nof his Virginian sire.\r\n\r\nAnd Thuvia of Ptarth, true daughter of Barsoom, found her breath\r\nquickening and heart leaping to the memory of this other smile—the\r\nsmile that she would never see again. With a little half-sob the girl\r\nsank to the pile of silks and furs that were tumbled in confusion\r\nbeneath the east windows, burying her face in her arms.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor outside her prison-room two men had paused in heated\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n“I tell you again, Astok,” one was saying, “that I shall not do this\r\nthing unless you be present in the room.”\r\n\r\nThere was little of the respect due royalty in the tone of the\r\nspeaker’s voice. The other, noting it, flushed.\r\n\r\n“Do not impose too far upon my friendship for you, Vas Kor,” he\r\nsnapped. “There is a limit to my patience.”\r\n\r\n“There is no question of royal prerogative here,” returned Vas Kor.\r\n“You ask me to become an assassin in your stead, and against your\r\njeddak’s strict injunctions. You are in no position, Astok, to dictate\r\nto me; but rather should you be glad to accede to my reasonable request\r\nthat you be present, thus sharing the guilt with me. Why should I bear\r\nit all?”\r\n\r\nThe younger man scowled, but he advanced toward the locked door, and as\r\nit swung in upon its hinges, he entered the room beyond at the side of\r\nVas Kor.\r\n\r\nAcross the chamber the girl, hearing them enter, rose to her feet and\r\nfaced them. Under the soft copper of her skin she blanched just a\r\ntrifle; but her eyes were brave and level, and the haughty tilt of her\r\nfirm little chin was eloquent of loathing and contempt.\r\n\r\n“You still prefer death?” asked Astok.\r\n\r\n“To _you_, yes,” replied the girl coldly.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Dusar turned to Vas Kor and nodded. The noble drew his\r\nshort-sword and crossed the room toward Thuvia.\r\n\r\n“Kneel!” he commanded.\r\n\r\n“I prefer to die standing,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“As you will,” said Vas Kor, feeling the point of his blade with his\r\nleft thumb. “In the name of Nutus, Jeddak of Dusar!” he cried, and ran\r\nquickly toward her.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Carthoris, Prince of Helium!” came in low tones from\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\nVas Kor turned to see the panthan he had recruited at his son’s house\r\nleaping across the floor toward him. The fellow brushed past Astok with\r\nan: “After him, you—calot!”\r\n\r\nVas Kor wheeled to meet the charging man.\r\n\r\n“What means this treason?” he cried.\r\n\r\nAstok, with bared sword, leaped to Vas Kor’s assistance. The panthan’s\r\nsword clashed against that of the noble, and in the first encounter Vas\r\nKor knew that he faced a master swordsman.\r\n\r\nBefore he half realized the stranger’s purpose he found the man between\r\nhimself and Thuvia of Ptarth, at bay facing the two swords of the\r\nDusarians. But he fought not like a man at bay. Ever was he the\r\naggressor, and though always he kept his flashing blade between the\r\ngirl and her enemies, yet he managed to force them hither and thither\r\nabout the room, calling to the girl to follow close behind him.\r\n\r\nUntil it was too late neither Vas Kor nor Astok dreamed of that which\r\nlay in the panthan’s mind; but at last as the fellow stood with his\r\nback toward the door, both understood—they were penned in their own\r\nprison, and now the intruder could slay them at his will, for Thuvia of\r\nPtarth was bolting the door at the man’s direction, first taking the\r\nkey from the opposite side, where Astok had left it when they had\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nAstok, as was his way, finding that the enemy did not fall immediately\r\nbefore their swords, was leaving the brunt of the fighting to Vas Kor,\r\nand now as his eyes appraised the panthan carefully they presently went\r\nwider and wider, for slowly he had come to recognize the features of\r\nthe Prince of Helium.\r\n\r\nThe Heliumite was pressing close upon Vas Kor. The noble was bleeding\r\nfrom a dozen wounds. Astok saw that he could not for long withstand the\r\ncunning craft of that terrible sword hand.\r\n\r\n“Courage, Vas Kor!” he whispered in the other’s ear. “I have a plan.\r\nHold him but a moment longer and all will be well,” but the balance of\r\nthe sentence, “with Astok, Prince of Dusar,” he did not voice aloud.\r\n\r\nVas Kor, dreaming no treachery, nodded his head, and for a moment\r\nsucceeded in holding Carthoris at bay. Then the Heliumite and the girl\r\nsaw the Dusarian prince run swiftly to the opposite side of the\r\nchamber, touch something in the wall that sent a great panel swinging\r\ninward, and disappear into the black vault beyond.\r\n\r\nIt was done so quickly that by no possibility could they have\r\nintercepted him. Carthoris, fearful lest Vas Kor might similarly elude\r\nhim, or Astok return immediately with reinforcements, sprang viciously\r\nin upon his antagonist, and a moment later the headless body of the\r\nDusarian noble rolled upon the ersite floor.\r\n\r\n“Come!” cried Carthoris. “There is no time to be lost. Astok will be\r\nback in a moment with enough warriors to overpower me.”\r\n\r\nBut Astok had no such plan in mind, for such a move would have meant\r\nthe spreading of the fact among the palace gossips that the Ptarthian\r\nprincess was a prisoner in the east tower. Quickly would the word have\r\ncome to his father, and no amount of falsifying could have explained\r\naway the facts that the jeddak’s investigation would have brought to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nInstead Astok was racing madly through a long corridor to reach the\r\ndoor of the tower-room before Carthoris and Thuvia left the apartment.\r\nHe had seen the girl remove the key and place it in her pocket-pouch,\r\nand he knew that a dagger point driven into the keyhole from the\r\nopposite side would imprison them in the secret chamber till eight dead\r\nworlds circled a cold, dead sun.\r\n\r\nAs fast as he could run Astok entered the main corridor that led to the\r\ntower chamber. Would he reach the door in time? What if the Heliumite\r\nshould have already emerged and he should run upon him in the\r\npassageway? Astok felt a cold chill run up his spine. He had no stomach\r\nto face that uncanny blade.\r\n\r\nHe was almost at the door. Around the next turn of the corridor it\r\nstood. No, they had not left the apartment. Evidently Vas Kor was still\r\nholding the Heliumite!\r\n\r\nAstok could scarce repress a grin at the clever manner in which he had\r\noutwitted the noble and disposed of him at the same time. And then he\r\nrounded the turn and came face to face with an auburn-haired, white\r\ngiant.\r\n\r\nThe fellow did not wait to ask the reason for his coming; instead he\r\nleaped upon him with a long-sword, so that Astok had to parry a dozen\r\nvicious cuts before he could disengage himself and flee back down the\r\nrunway.\r\n\r\nA moment later Carthoris and Thuvia entered the corridor from the\r\nsecret chamber.\r\n\r\n“Well, Kar Komak?” asked the Heliumite.\r\n\r\n“It is fortunate that you left me here, red man,” said the bowman. “I\r\nbut just now intercepted one who seemed over-anxious to reach this\r\ndoor—it was he whom they call Astok, Prince of Dusar.”\r\n\r\nCarthoris smiled.\r\n\r\n“Where is he now?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He escaped my blade, and ran down this corridor,” replied Kar Komak.\r\n\r\n“We must lose no time, then!” exclaimed Carthoris. “He will have the\r\nguard upon us yet!”\r\n\r\nTogether the three hastened along the winding passages through which\r\nCarthoris and Kar Komak had tracked the Dusarians by the marks of the\r\nlatter’s sandals in the thin dust that overspread the floors of these\r\nseldom-used passage-ways.\r\n\r\nThey had come to the chamber at the entrances to the lifts before they\r\nmet with opposition. Here they found a handful of guardsmen, and an\r\nofficer, who, seeing that they were strangers, questioned their\r\npresence in the palace of Astok.\r\n\r\nOnce more Carthoris and Kar Komak had recourse to their blades, and\r\nbefore they had won their way to one of the lifts the noise of the\r\nconflict must have aroused the entire palace, for they heard men\r\nshouting, and as they passed the many levels on their quick passage to\r\nthe landing stage they saw armed men running hither and thither in\r\nsearch of the cause of the commotion.\r\n\r\nBeside the stage lay the _Thuria_, with three warriors on guard. Again\r\nthe Heliumite and the Lotharian fought shoulder to shoulder, but the\r\nbattle was soon over, for the Prince of Helium alone would have been a\r\nmatch for any three that Dusar could produce.\r\n\r\nScarce had the _Thuria_ risen from the ways ere a hundred or more\r\nfighting men leaped to view upon the landing stage. At their head was\r\nAstok of Dusar, and as he saw the two he had thought so safely in his\r\npower slipping from his grasp, he danced with rage and chagrin, shaking\r\nhis fists and hurling abuse and vile insults at them.\r\n\r\nWith her bow inclined upward at a dizzy angle, the _Thuria_ shot\r\nmeteor-like into the sky. From a dozen points swift patrol boats darted\r\nafter her, for the scene upon the landing stage above the palace of the\r\nPrince of Dusar had not gone unnoticed.\r\n\r\nA dozen times shots grazed the _Thuria_’s side, and as Carthoris could\r\nnot leave the control levers, Thuvia of Ptarth turned the muzzles of\r\nthe craft’s rapid-fire guns upon the enemy as she clung to the steep\r\nand slippery surface of the deck.\r\n\r\nIt was a noble race and a noble fight. One against a score now, for\r\nother Dusarian craft had joined in the pursuit; but Astok, Prince of\r\nDusar, had built well when he built the _Thuria_. None in the navy of\r\nhis sire possessed a swifter flier; no other craft so well armoured or\r\nso well armed.\r\n\r\nOne by one the pursuers were distanced, and as the last of them fell\r\nout of range behind, Carthoris dropped the _Thuria_’s nose to a\r\nhorizontal plane, as with lever drawn to the last notch, she tore\r\nthrough the thin air of dying Mars toward the east and Ptarth.\r\n\r\nThirteen and a half thousand haads away lay Ptarth—a stiff thirty-hour\r\njourney for the swiftest of fliers, and between Dusar and Ptarth might\r\nlie half the navy of Dusar, for in this direction was the reported seat\r\nof the great naval battle that even now might be in progress.\r\n\r\nCould Carthoris have known precisely where the great fleets of the\r\ncontending nations lay, he would have hastened to them without delay,\r\nfor in the return of Thuvia to her sire lay the greatest hope of peace.\r\n\r\nHalf the distance they covered without sighting a single warship, and\r\nthen Kar Komak called Carthoris’ attention to a distant craft that\r\nrested upon the ochre vegetation of the great dead sea-bottom, above\r\nwhich the _Thuria_ was speeding.\r\n\r\nAbout the vessel many figures could be seen swarming. With the aid of\r\npowerful glasses, the Heliumite saw that they were green warriors, and\r\nthat they were repeatedly charging down upon the crew of the stranded\r\nairship. The nationality of the latter he could not make out at so\r\ngreat a distance.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary to change the course of the _Thuria_ to permit of\r\npassing directly above the scene of battle, but Carthoris dropped his\r\ncraft a few hundred feet that he might have a better and closer view.\r\n\r\nIf the ship was of a friendly power, he could do no less than stop and\r\ndirect his guns upon her enemies, though with the precious freight he\r\ncarried he scarcely felt justified in landing, for he could offer but\r\ntwo swords in reinforcement—scarce enough to warrant jeopardizing the\r\nsafety of the Princess of Ptarth.\r\n\r\nAs they came close above the stricken ship, they could see that it\r\nwould be but a question of minutes before the green horde would swarm\r\nacross the armoured bulwarks to glut the ferocity of their bloodlust\r\nupon the defenders.\r\n\r\n“It would be futile to descend,” said Carthoris to Thuvia. “The craft\r\nmay even be of Dusar—she shows no insignia. All that we may do is fire\r\nupon the hordesmen”; and as he spoke he stepped to one of the guns and\r\ndeflected its muzzle toward the green warriors at the ship’s side.\r\n\r\nAt the first shot from the _Thuria_ those upon the vessel below\r\nevidently discovered her for the first time. Immediately a device\r\nfluttered from the bow of the warship on the ground. Thuvia of Ptarth\r\ncaught her breath quickly, glancing at Carthoris.\r\n\r\nThe device was that of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol—the man to whom the\r\nPrincess of Ptarth was betrothed!\r\n\r\nHow easy for the Heliumite to pass on, leaving his rival to the fate\r\nthat could not for long be averted! No man could accuse him of\r\ncowardice or treachery, for Kulan Tith was in arms against Helium, and,\r\nfurther, upon the _Thuria_ were not enough swords to delay even\r\ntemporarily the outcome that already was a foregone conclusion in the\r\nminds of the watchers.\r\n\r\nWhat would Carthoris, Prince of Helium, do?\r\n\r\nScarce had the device broken to the faint breeze ere the bow of the\r\n_Thuria_ dropped at a sharp angle toward the ground.\r\n\r\n“Can you navigate her?” asked Carthoris of Thuvia.\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded.\r\n\r\n“I am going to try to take the survivors aboard,” he continued. “It\r\nwill need both Kar Komak and myself to man the guns while the Kaolians\r\ntake to the boarding tackle. Keep her bow depressed against the rifle\r\nfire. She can bear it better in her forward armour, and at the same\r\ntime the propellers will be protected.”\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the cabin as Thuvia took the control. A moment later the\r\nboarding tackle dropped from the keel of the _Thuria_, and from a dozen\r\npoints along either side stout, knotted leathern lines trailed\r\ndownward. At the same time a signal broke from her bow:\r\n\r\n“Prepare to board us.”\r\n\r\nA shout arose from the deck of the Kaolian warship. Carthoris, who by\r\nthis time had returned from the cabin, smiled sadly. He was about to\r\nsnatch from the jaws of death the man who stood between himself and the\r\nwoman he loved.\r\n\r\n“Take the port bow gun, Kar Komak,” he called to the bowman, and\r\nhimself stepped to the gun upon the starboard bow.\r\n\r\nThey could now feel the sharp shock of the explosions of the green\r\nwarriors’ projectiles against the armoured sides of the staunch\r\n_Thuria_.\r\n\r\nIt was a forlorn hope at best. At any moment the repulsive ray tanks\r\nmight be pierced. The men upon the Kaolian ship were battling with\r\nrenewed hope. In the bow stood Kulan Tith, a brave figure fighting\r\nbeside his brave warriors, beating back the ferocious green men.\r\n\r\nThe _Thuria_ came low above the other craft. The Kaolians were forming\r\nunder their officers in readiness to board, and then a sudden fierce\r\nfusillade from the rifles of the green warriors vomited their hail of\r\ndeath and destruction into the side of the brave flier.\r\n\r\nLike a wounded bird she dived suddenly Marsward careening drunkenly.\r\nThuvia turned the bow upward in an effort to avert the imminent\r\ntragedy, but she succeeded only in lessening the shock of the flier’s\r\nimpact as she struck the ground beside the Kaolian ship.\r\n\r\nWhen the green men saw only two warriors and a woman upon the deck of\r\nthe _Thuria_, a savage shout of triumph arose from their ranks, while\r\nan answering groan broke from the lips of the Kaolians.\r\n\r\nThe former now turned their attention upon the new arrival, for they\r\nsaw her defenders could soon be overcome and that from her deck they\r\ncould command the deck of the better-manned ship.\r\n\r\nAs they charged a shout of warning came from Kulan Tith, upon the\r\nbridge of his own ship, and with it an appreciation of the valour of\r\nthe act that had put the smaller vessel in these sore straits.\r\n\r\n“Who is it,” he cried, “that offers his life in the service of Kulan\r\nTith? Never was wrought a nobler deed of self-sacrifice upon Barsoom!”\r\n\r\nThe green horde was scrambling over the _Thuria_’s side as there broke\r\nfrom the bow the device of Carthoris, Prince of Helium, in reply to the\r\nquery of the jeddak of Kaol. None upon the smaller flier had\r\nopportunity to note the effect of this announcement upon the Kaolians,\r\nfor their attention was claimed slowly now by that which was\r\ntranspiring upon their own deck.\r\n\r\nKar Komak stood behind the gun he had been operating, staring with wide\r\neyes at the onrushing hideous green warriors. Carthoris, seeing him\r\nthus, felt a pang of regret that, after all, this man that he had\r\nthought so valorous should prove, in the hour of need, as spineless as\r\nJav or Tario.\r\n\r\n“Kar Komak—the man!” he shouted. “Grip yourself! Remember the days of\r\nthe glory of the seafarers of Lothar. Fight! Fight, man! Fight as never\r\nman fought before. All that remains to us is to die fighting.”\r\n\r\nKar Komak turned toward the Heliumite, a grim smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“Why should we fight,” he asked. “Against such fearful odds? There is\r\nanother way—a better way. Look!” He pointed toward the companion-way\r\nthat led below deck.\r\n\r\nThe green men, a handful of them, had already reached the _Thuria_’s\r\ndeck, as Carthoris glanced in the direction the Lotharian had\r\nindicated. The sight that met his eyes set his heart to thumping in joy\r\nand relief—Thuvia of Ptarth might yet be saved? For from below there\r\npoured a stream of giant bowmen, grim and terrible. Not the bowmen of\r\nTario or Jav, but the bowmen of an odwar of bowmen—savage fighting men,\r\neager for the fray.\r\n\r\nThe green warriors paused in momentary surprise and consternation, but\r\nonly for a moment. Then with horrid war-cries they leaped forward to\r\nmeet these strange, new foemen.\r\n\r\nA volley of arrows stopped them in their tracks. In a moment the only\r\ngreen warriors upon the deck of the _Thuria_ were dead warriors, and\r\nthe bowmen of Kar Komak were leaping over the vessel’s sides to charge\r\nthe hordesmen upon the ground.\r\n\r\nUtan after utan tumbled from the bowels of the _Thuria_ to launch\r\nthemselves upon the unfortunate green men. Kulan Tith and his Kaolians\r\nstood wide-eyed and speechless with amazement as they saw thousands of\r\nthese strange, fierce warriors emerge from the companion-way of the\r\nsmall craft that could not comfortably have accommodated more than\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nAt last the green men could withstand the onslaught of overwhelming\r\nnumbers no longer. Slowly, at first, they fell back across the ochre\r\nplain. The bowmen pursued them. Kar Komak, standing upon the deck of\r\nthe _Thuria_, trembled with excitement.\r\n\r\nAt the top of his lungs he voiced the savage war-cry of his forgotten\r\nday. He roared encouragement and commands at his battling utans, and\r\nthen, as they charged further and further from the _Thuria_, he could\r\nno longer withstand the lure of battle.\r\n\r\nLeaping over the ship’s side to the ground, he joined the last of his\r\nbowmen as they raced off over the dead sea-bottom in pursuit of the\r\nfleeing green horde.\r\n\r\nBeyond a low promontory of what once had been an island the green men\r\nwere disappearing toward the west. Close upon their heels raced the\r\nfleet bowmen of a bygone day, and forging steadily ahead among them\r\nCarthoris and Thuvia could see the mighty figure of Kar Komak,\r\nbrandishing aloft the Torquasian short-sword with which he was armed,\r\nas he urged his creatures after the retreating enemy.\r\n\r\nAs the last of them disappeared behind the promontory, Carthoris turned\r\ntoward Thuvia of Ptarth.\r\n\r\n“They have taught me a lesson, these vanishing bowmen of Lothar,” he\r\nsaid. “When they have served their purpose they remain not to embarrass\r\ntheir masters by their presence. Kulan Tith and his warriors are here\r\nto protect you. My acts have constituted the proof of my honesty of\r\npurpose. Good-bye,” and he knelt at her feet, raising a bit of her\r\nharness to his lips.\r\n\r\nThe girl reached out a hand and laid it upon the thick black hair of\r\nthe head bent before her. Softly she asked:\r\n\r\n“Where are you going, Carthoris?”\r\n\r\n“With Kar Komak, the bowman,” he replied. “There will be fighting and\r\nforgetfulness.”\r\n\r\nThe girl put her hands before her eyes, as though to shut out some\r\nmighty temptation from her sight.\r\n\r\n“May my ancestors have mercy upon me,” she cried, “if I say the thing I\r\nhave no right to say; but I cannot see you cast your life away,\r\nCarthoris, Prince of Helium! Stay, my chieftain. Stay—I love you!”\r\n\r\nA cough behind them brought both about, and there they saw standing,\r\nnot two paces from them Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol.\r\n\r\nFor a long moment none spoke. Then Kulan Tith cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“I could not help hearing all that passed,” he said. “I am no fool, to\r\nbe blind to the love that lies between you. Nor am I blind to the lofty\r\nhonour that has caused you, Carthoris, to risk your life and hers to\r\nsave mine, though you thought that that very act would rob you of the\r\nchance to keep her for your own.\r\n\r\n“Nor can I fail to appreciate the virtue that has kept your lips sealed\r\nagainst words of love for this Heliumite, Thuvia, for I know that I\r\nhave but just heard the first declaration of your passion for him. I do\r\nnot condemn you. Rather should I have condemned you had you entered a\r\nloveless marriage with me.\r\n\r\n“Take back your liberty, Thuvia of Ptarth,” he cried, “and bestow it\r\nwhere your heart already lies enchained, and when the golden collars\r\nare clasped about your necks you will see that Kulan Tith’s is the\r\nfirst sword to be raised in declaration of eternal friendship for the\r\nnew Princess of Helium and her royal mate!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLOSSARY OF NAMES AND TERMS USED IN THE MARTIAN BOOKS\r\n\r\nAaanthor.
