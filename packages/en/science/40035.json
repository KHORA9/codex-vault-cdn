THE WORLD OF MYRIAPODS AND A SINGLE LAND CRUSTACEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK OF MONSTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pictures in this book are portraits of creatures which are as much the\r\nreal inhabitants of the world as we are, and have all the rights of\r\nownership that we have, but, because their own struggle for existence so\r\noften crosses ours, many of them are our enemies. Indeed, man's own real\r\nstruggle for the supremacy of the world is his struggle to control these\r\ntiny monsters.\r\n\r\nThe plague of the middle ages, which spread like some mysterious\r\nsupernatural curse over Europe and carried off millions of people, the\r\nyellow fever that has haunted the coasts of South America, the malaria\r\nwhich has strewn the tropics of the world with millions of graves, have\r\nbeen caused by the activities of two of these monsters so universally\r\npresent in our homes as to have become almost domesticated creatures, the\r\nflea and the mosquito. During these last two decades these have come under\r\nour control, and the flies which leave a colony of germs at every footstep\r\nwill not much longer be tolerated, indeed, every creature that bites and\r\nsucks our blood or that crawls over our food and dishes has been placed\r\nunder suspicion.\r\n\r\nMan struggles against these tiny monsters not only for his life and health\r\nbut for his food as well. Almost every cultivated plant has its enemy, and\r\nsome of them have many. The bugs alone which stick their beaks into all\r\nsorts of plants to suck their juices would starve man out in one or two\r\nbrief seasons if they in turn were not held in check by enemies of their\r\nown. The chinch bug alone has demonstrated his power to devastate the\r\nwheat fields. The bark beetles that girdle square miles of forest trees,\r\nthe moths that destroy their foliage, the creatures that burrow into the\r\nfruit and fruit trees, the gall-forming flies that form galls on the roots\r\nof the grape vines able to destroy the revenues of a whole country, the\r\nbeetle which strips the potato of its leaves, the one which infects with\r\nits dirty jaws the melon vines of the South and turns the melon patches\r\nbrown--these are a few of the vast array of our enemies. It would require\r\na book much larger than this one just to enumerate those well known.\r\n\r\nIt should make every American proud to know that it is the American\r\neconomic entomologist who has, more than any other, pushed his way into\r\nthis field and shown mankind how to fight these monsters which destroy his\r\nfood, his animals and himself.\r\n\r\nBut all these fascinating little creatures are not our enemies. We must\r\nnot forget that man has domesticated certain of the insects and that\r\ngigantic industries depend upon them for their existence.\r\n\r\nThe honey-bee furnished mankind with sweets during the generations\r\npreceding the discovery of the sugar cane, and the silk worm furnishes\r\nstill the most costly raiment with which we clothe ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe friends we have in the insect world are those which destroy the pests\r\nof our cultivated crops like the Australian lady-bird beetle which has\r\nbeen sent from one country to the other to keep in check the fluted scale\r\nwhich is so injurious to the orange orchards, and the parasites of the\r\ngipsy-moth which, in Europe, helps to keep under control this plague of\r\nour forest trees, must certainly be counted as our friends.\r\n\r\nAlso, they are our friends if, like the spiders, they kill such monsters\r\nas suck our blood or make our lives unsafe, or, like the great hordes of\r\nwasps and hornets, wage unending warfare against the flies but which,\r\nbecause they attack us personally if we come too near their nests, we kill\r\non sight. Strangely enough, it is often these same stinging insects which\r\nhelp us by fertilizing the blossoms of our fruit trees. Indeed many plants\r\nare so dependent on these little creatures that they have lost the power\r\nof self-fertilizing and thousands of species of trees and plants would\r\nbecome extinct in a generation without their friendly aid.\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of some of the creatures pictured in this book were buried\r\nin the transparent amber of the Baltic many thousands of years ago and the\r\nfossil remains of others date back a million years or more, but while man\r\nhas been developing his surroundings from the primitive ones of savagery\r\nto the almost inconceivably complicated ones of civilized life, these\r\ncreatures, most of them at least, seem to be leading essentially the same\r\nkind of lives that they led hundreds of thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nThey have powers which neither man nor any other mammal ever dreamed of\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\nSome have powers of flight which enable them to sail a thousand miles\r\nbefore the wind. Others can jump a hundred times their own length. One of\r\nthese monsters can manufacture a liquid rope as easily as mammals produce\r\nmilk and with it weave aerial nets to trap their prey or, by attaching it,\r\ncan drop from the dizziest heights without danger, and when the rope has\r\nserved its purpose they eat it up.\r\n\r\nTheir weapons of defense are comparable to the deadly ones that only\r\npoisonous serpents have. If they were larger they would be, in fact, what\r\nlegend pictures the dragons to have been.\r\n\r\nThe unthinkably old germ plasm of these species produces creatures which\r\nact with a precision of purpose and a degree of absolute self-sacrifice\r\nwhich cannot fail to stagger the most conscientious of the human race.\r\nThey might even make one wonder whether the fulfillment of biological life\r\ndoes not consist in sacrifice of the individual for the good of the\r\nspecies to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that human thought is now drifting away from the\r\nconsideration of the individual and is coming to pay more attention to the\r\nspecies and the things which affect its development. This is a picture\r\nbook produced in the playtime hours of two busy people. It is a\r\ncollection of actual photographs of a few of the small-sized monsters\r\nwhich inhabit the tall grass, the flower garden and vegetable garden, the\r\npines and oaks of a place in the woods of Maryland.\r\n\r\nIf it should show to others a world of new and fascinating things it would\r\nbe simply doing for them what the taking of the photographs has done for\r\nus, opened the door into a realm of real life, of a terrible struggle to\r\nlive, which is as full of fascination as the dragon tales of old Japan. At\r\nthe same time, it makes us realize what vast and yet untouched fields of\r\nmaterial value lie in the efforts man is making to outwit and circumvent\r\nand even, perhaps, to exterminate such of the monsters as encroach upon\r\nhis own environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE MONSTER PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN\r\n\r\nIf you compare these photographs with those to be found in most books on\r\ninsects, you will find that they differ in several particulars. They are\r\nall either front views or side views of the creatures, whereas those in\r\nbooks on entomology are generally views from above. Imagine a book on the\r\nhorse in which only top views were shown, or a guide to a zoölogical\r\ngarden illustrated with the various wild beasts photographed from above.\r\nIt is true that, being an much larger, we generally look down at these\r\nmonsters, but a mouse also generally runs along the floor or under our\r\nfeet and yet a zoölogist pictures it from the same point of view that he\r\ndoes an elephant. Crows look down upon us, yet I imagine that no one will\r\nadmit that the crow's impression of human beings is as correct or as\r\ninteresting as that which we have of ourselves. Every creature has a right\r\nto be portrayed from its own level, and the reason these photographs are\r\nunusual is because they carry out this principle and do each creature\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nAnother particular in which these pictures are new is that, although they\r\nrepresent magnifications of from five to twenty diameters, they are not\r\nenlargements from small photographs, but views taken directly from 5 × 7\r\nphotographic negatives.\r\n\r\nThen too, these creatures have been posed with considerable care in order\r\nto give them a lifelike appearance, and this work was done immediately\r\nafter they had been anesthetized, and in some cases while they were still\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThe whole art of taking these large photographs of insects is so simple\r\nthat thousands of amateurs ought to be able to take them.\r\n\r\nThe outfit consists of the camera, which is just a long box, a long-focus\r\nlens, a piece of ground glass and a focusing glass, a flash light, a pair\r\nof pincers, some needles mounted in handles or else some small dental\r\ntools, a few little blocks of wood, a candle, a piece of glass covered\r\nwith tissue paper, and a long hollow cylinder made of stiff black paper or\r\ncardboard. Add to these a great deal of patience and you have all that is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nI made my camera box out of thin quarter-inch whitewood boards and pasted\r\nblack paper over the joints to keep out the light. Into one end of this\r\nbox I set the front board with the objective screwed into it. Squaring off\r\nthe other end of the box, I carefully fitted to it a 5 × 7-inch ground\r\nglass holder, exactly the size of an ordinary 5 × 7 plate holder. I framed\r\nthis in with pieces of wood so that I could slip out the ground glass\r\nholder and put a plate holder in its place. For purposes which will be\r\nexplained later, the ground glass was not fastened into its holder, but a\r\nnarrow slit through one end of the frame was made just large enough so\r\nthat it could be slid in or out without taking out the frame itself.\r\n\r\nThe object to be taken, having been mounted on a little block of wood and\r\nfastened there with candle wax, is placed in front of the long focus lens\r\nby an assistant, who stands ready to move it back and forth, or sideways,\r\nor up and down, according to directions.\r\n\r\nGetting to the far end of the camera under the focusing cloth, I begin to\r\nhunt for the dim image on the ground glass, and, by directing the\r\nassistant to move the object in various ways, am quickly able to bring it\r\ninto view, but not into sharp focus. In order to do this, I slip the\r\nground glass itself half way out, take up the focusing glass, holding it\r\nagainst the edge of the ground glass in order to steady it. I am thus able\r\nto see every detail distinctly without looking through the ground glass at\r\nall and can make sure that they are in focus. With the focusing lens, one\r\nis able to see the image in the air very plainly, even when the diaphragm\r\nis nearly closed and when only the faintest shadow could be seen on the\r\nground glass.\r\n\r\nHaving made sure that the image covers the plate well and is in good\r\nfocus, I put in my plate holder, my assistant places the cap over the\r\nobjective, I draw the slide and walk down to the front of the long camera.\r\nWills, my assistant, then prepares a charge in the Prosch flash lamp and\r\nputs the tube of black paper in front of the lens to protect it from the\r\nglare of the flash. With one hand I hold up a pane of glass on which thin\r\nwhite paper has been fastened to protect the insect from the direct\r\nsunlight; with the other hand I remove the cap of the camera and expose\r\nthe plate for from 50 to 80 seconds, depending upon the lightness of the\r\nobject, the brilliancy of the sunlight and the stop employed, 16, 32 or\r\n64. In the meantime, Wills blows off a full charge of magnesium powder in\r\nthe flash lamp, so holding the lamp that the rays from it will light up\r\nthe shadows which are underneath the creature's body. The cap is then put\r\non again and the plate holder closed in the ordinary way. Only the\r\nfreshest obtainable orthochromatic double-coated plates are used.\r\n\r\nThe friends who visited us on holidays helped make the long camera, and it\r\nwas made at three separate times, an eight-foot length at a time. When the\r\ncreature is very small I use the twenty-four-foot length, but when it is\r\nlarge the twelve or eight-foot one. Each length fits into the one in front\r\nof it and is covered with black cloth to make it tight.\r\n\r\nThe taking of the photographs is not, however, the hardest work of monster\r\nphotographing, although perhaps the hottest, for in summer it is no joke\r\nto swelter under a focusing cloth for half an hour at a time, and the\r\nfocusing itself is hard on the eyes. It is the mounting of the beasts\r\nwhich wears upon one's nerves, and here is where the woman's skill comes,\r\nfor Mrs. Fairchild learned the art of insect taxidermy and many of the\r\nmost lifelike photographs in the book were mounted by her.\r\n\r\nIt has been a source of keen satisfaction to find, upon showing the\r\nresults to professional entomologists, that many of them did not realize\r\nthat the insects were not alive when photographed. But, although they were\r\nnot alive, they had just recently been put to sleep with ether, for we\r\nsoon discovered that to get a lifelike photograph one must photograph a\r\nmonster at once, within half an hour after death, the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nMany ways of mounting were tried, but none were so successful as the\r\nfollowing: Cover the top of a small block of wood with a thin, even\r\ncoating of paraffin or ordinary candle wax by letting the drippings of the\r\ncandle fall upon it. Pick a large leaf and turn its upper surface down\r\nupon the wax, before it cools, and let it stick there; this will give a\r\nnatural looking ground for the insect to stand upon. Hold the insect over\r\nthe block of wood and arrange the legs in as natural a position as you can\r\nwith a long needle or fine dental tool. Then fasten each foot in place by\r\nheating the needle in the candle flame and pricking a hole in the leaf\r\njust under each foot so that the wax will come up through the leaf and\r\nhold it fast.\r\n\r\nThis mounting is not so simple as it seems, and, until one has actually\r\nexperienced it, he can have no idea of the perversity of these six-legged\r\nbeasts. The way the contracting muscles of a grasshopper's back legs will\r\npull the other four legs loose, or the way the hornet will refuse to hold\r\nits head up, or the way long flexible antennæ will droop are exasperations\r\nwhich lead straight to profanity, unless one is very careful.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is a game of quickness, ingenuity and patient skill, for\r\nso many things must be watched at once. The wilting insect cannot wait,\r\nthe sunlight shifts, clouds drift across the sun and then, just as\r\neverything is in readiness, a breeze springs up which stirs the creature's\r\nwings and the whole thing has to be given up.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer in this field of photography is Dr. N. A. Cobb, for it is he\r\nwho first showed what the face of a fly looks like. His suggestions are\r\nwhat first encouraged me to take up the work, although the method finally\r\nused by me is quite different from that which he employed. I substituted\r\nthe long horizontal camera and the long focus lens for his vertical\r\nbellows and short focus lens, believing that for larger creatures I get a\r\ngreater depth of focus and more lifelike appearance.\r\n\r\nAfter my first mild success, that critical period beyond which so many\r\nexperiments never go, three friends came to the rescue with their\r\nenthusiastic approval and encouragement and I desire that their names be\r\nconnected with this book which they have helped to make, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nAlexander Graham Bell and Mr. Barbour Lathrop.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONG CAMERA WITH WHICH THE MONSTERS WERE TAKEN\r\n\r\nThe camera, consisting of several long boxes which fit into one another,\r\nis stretched on a table made of board and a number of posts set in the\r\nground. At one end is the lens and at the other, the ground glass plate to\r\nfocus the image on. The monster is mounted on a small wooden block and set\r\nup the proper distance in front of the lens. It is moved back and forth in\r\nresponse to directions from the operator, at the other end of the camera,\r\nwho is watching the image on the ground glass. Lying on the camera above\r\nthe lens is a black paper cone which, when everything is ready, is put\r\nover the lens between it and the monster to prevent the smoke from the\r\nflash powder from drifting between the lens and the insect during the\r\nexposure. Wills, the assistant, is holding the Prosch magnesium blow lamp,\r\nand the insect is shaded from the direct rays of the sun by a large pane\r\nof glass covered with a thin sheet of tissue paper. Direct sunlight is\r\nreflected from the hairs and polished surfaces of the insects and makes\r\nspots on the negative.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF THE MONSTERS AS THEY APPEAR WHEN MOUNTED ON PINS IN\r\nAN INSECT BOX\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed a pity to me that these beautiful forms of life\r\nshould be so evanescent. We look at their dried remains in collections and\r\nare impressed by their colors and grotesque forms, but we should not\r\nforget that after all these are nothing but their dried-up corpses and\r\nscarcely more to be compared in real beauty with their living bodies than\r\nare the Egyptian mummies comparable to the living faces and forms of the\r\ngreat Pharaohs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONSTERS PICTURED ON THE SUCCEEDING PAGES, AND MANY\r\nMORE, IMPRISONED IN ONE MUSEUM CASE\r\n\r\nThey are all pinned in the box and have dried out and changed almost\r\nbeyond recognition, but the impression which their portraits have made\r\nwill, I hope, be lasting.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing little about insects I have been dependent upon the kindness of\r\nthe entomologists of the National Museum, in particular on Dr. L. O.\r\nHoward, for the scientific names of the monsters, which names have given\r\nme access to what is published about them in the handbooks on entomology.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the negatives and prints have been made by Mr. Scott\r\nClime of the Department of Agriculture, who took a particular interest in\r\ntheir preparation.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor, Director and Editor of the National\r\nGeographic Society, is due the credit of realizing the popular interest\r\nthese pictures would have and who, in contrast with more timid publishers,\r\nreproduced thirty-nine of them in the National Geographic Magazine and\r\nurged the preparation of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SPIDER WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIDER WORLD\r\n\r\nIn enlarging the images of these small spiders to many times their size,\r\none is at once struck by their similarity to crabs and lobsters. Their\r\njointed legs encased in shells, which from time to time they shed, remind\r\none strongly of the crabs, and they do in fact belong to the some great\r\nfamily, the family of arthropods, and they are not insects.\r\n\r\nThe spider world is the world of eight-legged creatures just as the insect\r\nworld is the world of the six-legged ones, and educated men and women\r\nshould no more confuse these great classes of beings than they confuse the\r\nbipeds with the quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThey differ from the insects in other ways than in the number of their\r\nlegs--they have no feelers or antennæ, those wonderful sense organs which\r\nall insects have, but here and there, especially on the legs, are strange\r\nhollow bristles or spines, which end in nerves. Their eyes also are not\r\nlike insects' eyes. An insect's eyes, at least its large prominent ones,\r\nare composed of hundreds of lenses or facets, while the spider, though he\r\ngenerally boasts of eight, has only simple ones with single lenses.\r\n\r\nTheir life is very simple as compared with that of many of the insects. In\r\nthe fall, the mother spiders lay their eggs in a bag of their own silk,\r\noften several hundred eggs being laid in one sac. The spiderlings hatch\r\nout in the sac, and, in the North, they spend the long winter there.\r\n\r\nThey do not have two stages of existence as beetles or butterflies do, but\r\nare hatched out mature and equipped with the poison fangs which aid them\r\nin their strictly carnivorous, and often even cannibalistic, existence.\r\n\r\nThey grow and shed their skins as do the baby grasshoppers, but they do\r\nnot change their form with each moult and none of them have wings.\r\n\r\nThey have inside their bodies, reservoirs of strange, sticky fluids which\r\nthey can pour out through spigots in many different ways. This fluid, as\r\nit dries, may form drag lines which they trail behind them and fasten as\r\nthey go to use for safety lines; with some spiders it may even be poured\r\nout in such quantities that it makes an aeroplane; with the majority,\r\nhowever, it is used to make their nests or their egg sacs or the\r\nmarvelously beautiful orbs that prove the graveyards of so many careless\r\ninsects. For the spiders are the enemies of the insect world; were they\r\nmore discriminating, they would be perhaps the greatest friends of the\r\nhuman race, but, as they suck all kinds of insects' blood, all that we can\r\nbe sure of is that those among them which we find in our houses are a\r\nbenefit, for there they kill the flies and other insects which we do not\r\nwant indoors.\r\n\r\nTo their Southern and especially their tropical cousins, which attack and\r\nsometimes kill human beings, this group of fascinating creatures owes the\r\ndread in which it is held by people in general. It is a pity, for\r\nthroughout the Northern states, no dangerous species is known to exist,\r\nand those which frequent our houses will no more attack us than do the\r\nflies they catch and devour.\r\n\r\nUntil a child has gazed in wonder at an orb weaver as it spins its web\r\nbetween the trees, or been an eye-witness of the death of some insect\r\nunlucky enough to fall into a web, he has not taken his first step toward\r\nthe wonderland which touches him on every side and he is in grave danger\r\nof growing up with a blind side--the side turned toward the field and\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nThere are millions upon millions of spiders, and thousands of species, and\r\nthey live everywhere from the Arctic Regions to the Tropics. They devour\r\ncountless myriads of flies and gnats and hosts of other insects, and\r\nnobody knows just what good they do us, but every entomologist would hold\r\nup his hands in fear at what the result might be should the spiders of the\r\nworld be blotted out. They must hold countless parasites in check and help\r\nto keep the balance even.\r\n\r\nIf all the little children should learn that they are harmless, I wonder\r\nif they could not stop their nurses from killing them. It is the ignorance\r\nof those who train our little ones that keeps alive the unreasoning hatred\r\ntowards so many of the wonder creatures of the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN EIGHT EYED ENEMY OF THE FLY; A JUMPING SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Phidippus audax_, Hentz)\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed to beasts with two eyes that it is hard to realize\r\nthat all around us, though hard to see, are little monsters with many eyes\r\nof various sizes.\r\n\r\nThis one has eight eyes, four of which are invisible from the front. The\r\neyes are diurnal, enabling the creature to hunt only by day. Its eight\r\nstout legs fit it for jumping forward or sideways with great ease. In\r\ncomparison with its size, its jumping powers are incredible. If it were\r\nthe size of a tiger, it would be a beast of prey which could clear a\r\nquarter of a mile at a bound.\r\n\r\nIt can sit on a branch and throw out an elastic dragline behind, strong\r\nenough to bear its weight, and by this means it is able to jump at and\r\ncatch its prey on the fly, regaining its position by climbing up the\r\ndragline. Add to this that it possesses a pair of powerful hollow fangs,\r\ninto which poison sacs empty, and a voraciousness which often leads it\r\ninto cannibalism, and you have a fair picture of this jumping spider,\r\nwhich is one of a thousand species of little creatures found everywhere\r\nexcept in the polar regions. They range in size from a third to a half an\r\ninch long and live under stones and sticks, spending the winter in a\r\nsilken bag of their own manufacture, but never spinning a web. The males\r\nof some species have been observed to dance before the females, holding up\r\ntheir hairy legs above their heads apparently to show off their\r\nornamentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nREADY TO POUNCE ON A FLY ON THE WING; THE JUMPING SPIDER\r\n\r\nThese is something diabolical in the way these four black eyes in a row\r\nstare one out of countenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA JUMPING SPIDER READY TO SPRING FROM A LEAF\r\n\r\n(_Phidippus togatus_, Koch.)\r\n\r\nI must confess to a peculiar feeling of embarrassment, almost of fear,\r\ntowards a jumping spider. It stares at you so intently and seems no\r\nfearless as it wheels to keep you covered with its battery of eyes; and\r\nyou never know which way it is going to jump.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF-SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Lycosa carolinensis_, Walck.)\r\n\r\nThis is not the photograph of a polar bear, but that of a wolf-spider,\r\nwith a battery of eight eyes on the top of its head and poison fangs\r\nhanging below.\r\n\r\nSome such impression as this, I imagine, must be made on the retina of a\r\nfly or beetle when, in wandering through the grass at dusk, it suddenly\r\nfinds itself face to face with a wolf-spider sitting on the turret which\r\nforms the entrance to its web-lined hole in the ground.\r\n\r\nBehind and above the fangs and hidden in their shadow is the creature's\r\nmouth, toothless and made for sucking only. With his fangs, this\r\nwolf-spider kills and crushes his victim; then he sucks the body dry and\r\nthrows away the carcass.\r\n\r\nSeen here and there above the body hairs are black spines, hollow inside\r\nand connected with the nerves of touch. Of his eyes, the two in the center\r\nin front are supposed to be for use by day, while all the others are\r\nnocturnal, enabling him to stalk his prey at dusk. It is the wolf-spider\r\nthat often appears at night within the circle of lamplight searching for\r\nnocturnal insects.\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal eyes are remarkable organs, with reflecting structures so\r\nplaced behind the retina that the light entering the eye traverses the\r\nretina twice, and it is supposed that this reflecting structure increases\r\nthe effect of any faint light, enabling the creature to \"see in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a hunting spider, chasing its prey through the grass or lurking\r\nunder stones, especially in damp places.\r\n\r\nIt does not spin a web, but lives in a silk-lined hole six or eight inches\r\ndeep, which it digs in the ground, and around the entrance to which, out\r\nof sticks and grass, it builds a turret or watch-tower, from which it can\r\nsee its prey more readily than from the ground. These spider holes are\r\ncommon in the meadows of Maryland.\r\n\r\nIn form and color the wolf-spider resembles the famous tarantula of\r\nsouthern Europe, the bite of which was supposed to cause the tarantella,\r\nor dancing madness; but it is as harmless as a butterfly, and indeed,\r\nDoctor Comstock, who is the authority on spiders, believes that no spiders\r\nin the Northern states are poisonous to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CAST OFF OUTER SKELETON OF A WOLF-SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Lycosa punctulata_, Hentz)\r\n\r\nThis photograph is of the outer skeleton or shell of a small wolf-spider\r\nwhich I found clinging to the focusing cloth of my camera after it had\r\nbeen lying on the grass.\r\n\r\nWith us the bony skeleton is internal and grows as we grow. With spiders\r\nthe skeleton is a tough, leathery structure, which cannot change; so that\r\nthe young, rapidly growing spider soon finds his shell too tight for him,\r\nand, like a crab, he bursts his shell and pulls his soft body from each\r\nleg and complicated cavity.\r\n\r\nThis process seems marvelous, but is really comparatively simple when we\r\nrealize that before the old shell is cast off it is loosened from the new\r\nskin by the moulting fluid which is excreted from glands opening through\r\nthis new skin.\r\n\r\nAfter the old skin is loosened it splits along the sides of the body and\r\nin front of the eyes, the slit being just above the legs and jaws, and\r\nthat portion of the old skeleton which had covered the back is lifted off\r\nlike a lid. The new skin, at first elastic enough to accommodate the\r\nincreased size of the body, soon becomes hardened like the old, and must\r\nin its turn be shed.\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, the surprise of a wolf-spider who, in running through\r\nthe grass, should stumble over his own outgrown skeleton, so like his\r\nformer self in all its details that he could scarcely fail to recognize it\r\nas his own; for even the transparent cornea of the eye is a part of this\r\nouter skeleton and is shed with it, as well as the jaws, sensitive spines,\r\nand hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE SPINY-BELLIED SPIDER WHICH BUILDS NETS ACROSS THE PATH\r\n\r\n(_Acrosoma gracile_, Walck.)\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to the dromedary's hump and the kangaroo's big tail, but\r\nhad this creature been as big as either, or were we Lilliputians, its\r\nblack and white spiny body, shaped at the bottom like an umbrella stand,\r\nwould attract more attention at the zoo than either of those desert\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nIts eight long, crab-like legs are made for spinning, and across the\r\nopenings in the forest it stretches a great net in which to snare its\r\ngame. On this it sits protected from the birds to whose eyes it looks from\r\nabove like some bird's droppings in the web. This one is a female and its\r\nmate is said to be much smaller and quite different, with no humps or\r\nspines at all and a long narrow body.\r\n\r\nThe courtship of spiders is often a dangerous business for the male, and\r\nperhaps it is quite as well for him that he is often smaller and more\r\nagile than his mate, for if the female is not ready to receive his\r\nadvances, she is apt to pounce upon him and destroy him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE BIRD-DROPPING SPIDER, A CREATURE WITH PROTECTIVE COLORING\r\n\r\n(_Epeira verrucosa_, Hentz)\r\n\r\nThis orb weaver had swung its net across a wood road, and so perfectly did\r\nthe white patch on its back resemble a bird's dropping that until my hand\r\ntouched the net I failed to realize that a living thing was hanging there.\r\nThere is something strangely fascinating about the compelling force of\r\ninstinct: a spider hatched in captivity who has never seen a web made,\r\nwill weave its own in the same delicate and intricate pattern that its\r\nmother made, using the different kinds of rope correctly, and spacing each\r\nstrand with a mathematical precision. Indeed, the web of this untutored\r\nlittle spiderling will be as characteristic of its species as the white\r\nspot upon its back. It would be as though a child, cast alone on a desert\r\nisland, should build a house in all details precisely like its ancestral\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE AERIAL TRAPPER: THE ORB-WEAVING SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Epeira trivittata_, Keys.)\r\n\r\nHidden behind these eight four-jointed legs of varying lengths, covered\r\nwith hollow, sensitive bristles, is the spider's head, with eight eyes,\r\nstrong jaws, poison fangs, and a pair of palpi, which look like extremely\r\nshort legs and seem to serve as hands. The hairy body is filled with\r\nthousands of eggs and contains also a marvelous reservoir of liquid rope\r\nopening into spinnerets on the under side of the body. Some of the tubes\r\nor spinnerets make strong and dry filaments and others make sticky ones.\r\nThe radiating threads of the spider's web, those which compose the\r\nframework, are stiff and dry; the spiral threads, however, which join them\r\ntogether, are coated with a substance which no little flying creature can\r\nstrike against without running the risk of sticking fast.\r\n\r\nBefore you are up on a summer's morning this wonderful creature will have\r\nmanufactured what would be equivalent to two miles of elastic and sticky\r\nrope if she were as large as a six-foot man. With the skill of an\r\nexperienced fish-net maker, she will, in a few hours, construct a net as\r\nlarge as a cartwheel, which like the whale-nets of New Zealand, though\r\nthey may break with the floundering of the prey, bewilder it and tire it\r\nout with struggling.\r\n\r\nThe orb-weaver is the aerial trapper among living creatures, stretching\r\nits sticky, elastic web across the aerial runway of its prey and waiting\r\nwith a patience which would drive a fisherman insane.\r\n\r\nTo insects of its own size, the orb-weaver is a hideous, bloodthirsty\r\nmonster. It sinks its fangs into its struggling prey, injects a poison\r\nquite as deadly as that of the rattlesnake, and quickly sucks the blood of\r\nits victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nORB-WEAVER FILLED WITH A THOUSAND EGGS WHICH SHE LAYS ALL AT ONCE\r\n\r\n(_Epeira domiciliorum_, Hentz)\r\n\r\nAtlas with the world on his back, as imagined by the boys of Athens, could\r\nnot have been more strange than this creature with her distended yellow\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nSome of her kin have fasting powers almost beyond belief; they have been\r\nkept alive in captivity for eighteen months without food.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of the commonest orb-weavers on the American\r\ncontinent, and its webs, like great cartwheels, are to be found across the\r\npathways in the woods and everywhere in clearings in the wood-lot.\r\n\r\nShe is a tight-rope performer her whole life long and her long, muscular\r\nlegs seem well fitted to enable her to hang, week after week, from her\r\nweb, supporting in her much enlarged body a thousand or so eggs, which she\r\nwill later lay, not one at a time, but all at once. No surprise is sudden\r\nenough to catch her unprepared and make her fall from the dizzy heights\r\nwhere she lives, without first being able to attach an anchor line. This\r\nshe does by rubbing her spinnerets over the surface on which she stands,\r\nand by quickly spreading and bringing them together again she makes an\r\nattachment disc from which she can reel out her rope and check her fall.\r\n\r\nThe gift of spinning from internal reservoirs, supplied by active\r\nsecreting cells, is common in the insect world as well as in the world of\r\nspiders, for thousands of species of caterpillars make cocoons of silk\r\nwhich they spin as rapidly as any spider makes its web. I doubt if any\r\nsilk-gowned lady ever stops to think how many thousand gorgeous moths have\r\nbeen cut short in their careers in order that the threads which the\r\nsilkworms have thrown around them to make a nest in which to pupate could\r\nbe reeled off to make the silken stuff she wears.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA SPIDER FROM A FLY'S POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\n(_Dolomedes tenebrosus_, Hentz)\r\n\r\nA spider from the fly's point of view is a terrible monster, indeed. Its\r\nclaws of polished chitin, sharp as sword points, each with an aperture\r\nleading to a sac filled with deadly poison, its array of eyes of different\r\nsizes, its mottled, hairy skin covered with hollow sensitive bristles, and\r\nits powerful, leg-like palpi must strike terror to the heart of any fly or\r\ncockroach which may happen in its neighborhood.\r\n\r\nCivilized man rarely sees the ferocity of wild beasts displayed, for even\r\nin the jungle it is hard to observe. To anyone, however, who will watch a\r\nspider devour a fly, the true picture of merciless cruelty will be\r\napparent. With its poisoned sword-like fangs it kills its prey, and then,\r\nwith its sucking mouthparts, it sucks the juice out of the carcass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER SPIDER AND HER NEST: A NURSERY OF LITTLE CANNIBALS\r\n\r\nThis mother belongs to the nursery-web weavers. She wove a silken bag for\r\nher eggs and carried it about with her under her body until she found a\r\nsuitable place to leave it. She had to stand on tiptoes to prevent its\r\ndragging--it was so big.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows the spiderlings hatched and running about, hundreds\r\nof them, over the fine-spun mass of silk.\r\n\r\nIn these nurseries the strong eat up the weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA VAGABOND SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Pardosa milvina_, Hentz)\r\n\r\nThis is a vagabond of the spider world, building no nest or web, content\r\nto use her marvelous silk in the construction only of a sac in which to\r\nlay her eggs. This sac she carries about with her until the eggs have\r\nhatched and the spiderlings are strong enough to take care of themselves,\r\nand then she rips open the sac along a distinct seam on the edge and turns\r\nher babies loose to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nThese voracious little cannibals have, however, already learned to forage,\r\nas the struggle for existence in many species of spiders begins in the egg\r\nsac, and it is only the strongest who emerge. In other words, they eat\r\neach other up.\r\n\r\nThey do not grow to be more than half an inch in length, but they are\r\namong the most active of all spiders, and in the United States alone there\r\nare nearly a score of species of these little soldiers of fortune living\r\nnowhere and roaming the damp fields in search of prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE MALE GRASS SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Agelina nævia_, Walck.)\r\n\r\nOn a summer morning, if you rise with the sun, and if the night has been\r\ncool, you will find your lawn covered with most exquisite shimmering\r\ngossamer patches, so diaphanous that if you touch them or breathe on them\r\nthey fade away. These are the webs of the young grass spiders and, if you\r\nwatch one of them closely, you will see that the tiny spider is waiting\r\nbelow the web in a funnel of woven spider's silk. It will run out quickly\r\nenough if you throw a fly into its net. It is not an orb-weaver and runs\r\nover its net instead of climbing along the under side of it as many\r\norb-weavers do.\r\n\r\nThat this is the photograph of a mature male is evident from the genital\r\npalpi, resembling a pair of short front legs.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn the males and females both desert their webs to wander, for\r\nit is not only their mating season but the close of their brief existence.\r\nUnder a bit of bark the female lays her eggs and waits for death, guarding\r\nher progeny till she dies, although she has no hope of seeing them alive.\r\n\r\nHow, by what marvelous machinery, do these microscopic eggs beneath the\r\nbark inherit, not only the color and the form but the knowledge of web\r\nbuilding which their dead parents possessed? Is there not something wrong\r\nin our idea of the individual as a separate thing rather than as a\r\ntransitory part of a living network which has been in existence perhaps a\r\nmillion years, alternating in its form, now as a moving hairy-legged\r\nthing, and now as a round immobile egg?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CRAB SPIDER THAT LURKS AROUND THE NECTARIES OF FLOWERS\r\n\r\n(_Xysticus gulosus_, Keys.)\r\n\r\nLike the beasts of prey which lurk around the water holes of African\r\ndeserts, waiting for the feebler game to come down to drink, the crab\r\nspiders conceal themselves around the nectar-bearing discs of flowers.\r\nThese nectar cups are the feeding places of thousands of sucking\r\ncreatures, and the tragedies which take place in the shadows of the rose\r\nor lily petals are things we do not like to think of, for they are quite\r\nas real, quite as horrible and bloody struggles as those upon a larger\r\nscale, the very thought of which makes our blood run cold.\r\n\r\nThe crab spiders cannot run forward but dart sidewise and backward at\r\ngreat speed. One cannot help wondering if this ability may not often be an\r\nadvantage rather than a drawback and enable the creature to surprise its\r\nprey by turning its back on it, something as a left-handed man often\r\nsurprises an antagonist.\r\n\r\nThat these spiders run their own grave risks in this life around the\r\nnectar \"water holes\" is evident, for they form a large proportion of the\r\nfood of mud wasps and if you want a handful of them, tear down a few mud\r\ndaubers' nests sometime in June and empty out their contents. The\r\nbrilliant colors will surprise you and suggest that possibly the yellow\r\nones haunt the yellow flowers and the blue the blue ones.\r\n\r\nThe particular species whose low, sprawling form is shown in the\r\nphotograph is one of forty occurring in the United States and, although it\r\nis only from a fourth to a third of an inch long, is considered one of the\r\nlarge species. It is dull-colored, and, unlike its gaily-colored\r\nrelatives, awaits its prey under bark and stones.\r\n\r\nIt spins no web and the small male leads a thoroughly vagabond life,\r\nwhereas the female, in most species at least, settles down toward the end\r\nof her life and, after depositing her silken lens-shaped sac of eggs in\r\nsome protected spot, she lingers near as if to guard it till she dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA FRONT VIEW OF A MATURE MALE SPIDER\r\n\r\nThe reason for existence is so perplexing that it is no wonder we fall\r\nback on mysticism whenever we try to explain it.\r\n\r\nInexplicable as it seems when we consider our own lot as humans, the\r\nmystery is no less great when we try to view existence from the standpoint\r\nof a male spider.\r\n\r\nIs it not probable that we cling so dearly to the idea of our own\r\nexistence as individuals that we forget we are only halves of a whole, and\r\nthat the whole itself is only a fraction of that vague living something\r\nspread out over the earth, moving in millions of places at once which we\r\ncall a living species?\r\n\r\nWhen we shall have shifted our sympathies and made them cover a thousand\r\ngenerations of beings, we shall have risen to the point of view that a\r\ndivinity must take.\r\n\r\nThe enigmas of existence, I venture to say, will only be understood from\r\nthis standpoint and not from the more sympathetic one of regret over the\r\nshortness, cruelty or barrenness of any individual's life.\r\n\r\nThe male spider seems peculiarly to be just a tool in the machinery of\r\ndescent, merely a carrier of the male germ cells which, whenever, and not\r\nbefore, they come in contact with their female counterparts, start into\r\nactivity the marvelous growth which results in new individuals similar to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThese male cells which form within its body, mature, and are ejected as\r\nliving, ciliated things into a web of special make; and two special\r\nsyringes formed late in life at the tips of the leg-like palpi draw them\r\nup and hold them stored until it is time for them to be injected during\r\nthe mating process into special sacs within the female, where they fuse in\r\nsome strange way with female cells and start the following generation.\r\n\r\nHis palpi once emptied of these male cells, of what further use to the\r\nspecies can he be and why should not the carnivorous female promptly eat\r\nhim up?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE DADDY-LONG-LEGS OR HARVESTMAN\r\n\r\n(_Leiobunum grande_, Weed)\r\n\r\nWho has not watched daddy-long-legs stalk majestically across the floor or\r\nup the wall, one long slender leg waving in front of him like the arm of\r\nsome gesticulating prophet of old? Indeed, the fly or mosquito is hardly\r\nmore familiar.\r\n\r\nLong-leggedness is all relative to size of body, and viewed from this\r\nstandpoint everyone must agree that the harvestman is the longest-legged\r\ncreature in the world. If its body were the size of a flamingo its legs\r\nwould cover over thirty feet of ground. As it has eight legs and each leg\r\nis eight times the length of its body it has sixty-four times as much\r\nlength of leg as of body.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange, spider creature having only two eyes which look to right\r\nand left from a turret-like hump in the middle of its back. Its claws in\r\nfront have pincers like a crab's. Opposite the first pair of legs are\r\nscent glands from which it pours out a fluid which has so bad an odor that\r\nit seems to protect it from its foes.\r\n\r\nSwung low between its legs, this creature of twilight and shade wanders in\r\nsearch of small insects which it catches and devours as other spiders do.\r\nIt only lives one season in the North and spins no web and makes no nest.\r\nThe female lays her eggs deep down in the ground or under stones or in the\r\ncrevices of the bark of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE INSECT WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAIGHT-WINGED INSECTS\r\n\r\n(_Orthoptera_)\r\n\r\nWhen children play with pebbles on the beach, they often put the red ones\r\nin one group, the white ones in another. It is much the same with men,\r\nthey try to put the things that are alike together, and in the bewildering\r\nmultitude of shapes and forms and habits with which the insect specialists\r\nhave had to deal, they catch at any similarity, and put together in one\r\ngroup a lot of creatures which are only alike in a few particulars.\r\n\r\nIn the straight-winged order of orthoptera they have put the creatures\r\nwhich have four wings, the front pair being leather-like and smaller than\r\nthe other pair, which latter fold up like a fan. They are also all\r\nequipped with strong biting jaws. Bugs often look like them, but bugs have\r\nbeaks and never jaws.\r\n\r\nIt is in this order that are found nearly all of the true song insects, at\r\nleast so far as human ears can tell. The grasshoppers, the katydids and\r\ncrickets are the great music makers of the insect world, although it is\r\ntrue that there is one, perhaps the loudest, shrillest singer of them all\r\nwhich is classified among the bugs, the lyreman, or cicada, one of the\r\nspecies of which is known as the seventeen-year locust.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk of the hum of insects we do not often stop to think that it\r\nis quite a different thing in general from their song. Most insects in\r\ntheir flight, providing that their wings move fast enough, make some kind\r\nof a noise. The humming of the bee, the buzzing of the house fly and\r\nmosquito and the whirring of the clumsy beetle's wings are quite a\r\ndifferent thing from the conscious song of the katydid to its mate, or the\r\nsinging of the cricket on the hearth.\r\n\r\nOf course it is impossible for us to be quite sure that there is not a\r\nhost of insects who have means of making some kind of a noise which is so\r\nhigh up in the scale of noises as to be too faint for us to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE KING GRASSHOPPER\r\n\r\n(_Hippiscus sp._)\r\n\r\nAs this young king grasshopper stands looking so inquiringly at one with\r\nhis varicolored eyes, each of which is composed of hundreds of facets, I\r\ncannot help thinking that he represents a creature quite as fascinating\r\nand actually more dangerous than the East African monsters of our school\r\ngeographies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is perfectly natural, but it does not seem right, that so\r\nlittle emphasis should be laid in our histories upon the terrible\r\nstruggles of man with his insect enemies. The time will come when we shall\r\nrecognize this warfare, when we shall realize how much of human happiness\r\nlies buried on the battlefields of our struggle against the insect hordes.\r\n\r\nThe members of one species of this great family can sail for a thousand\r\nmiles before the wind, and they go in such numbers that they make a cloud\r\n2,000 square miles in extent.\r\n\r\nThey multiply in such numbers as to baffle all calculation, and every\r\nliving green thing for thousands of square miles disappears down their\r\nthroats, leaving the country they infest desolate. The great famine of\r\nEgypt, mentioned in the book of Exodus, the grasshopper years of Kansas,\r\nwhich ruined thousands of families on our plains, and more recent\r\ndevastations in Argentina and South Africa are examples of the tremendous\r\neffects which the migratory locusts have had upon the happiness of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe famines which have followed in their wake have cost the lives of\r\nhundreds of thousands of human beings and ruined the lives of millions of\r\nothers. We have become so accustomed to the idea that the farmer must\r\nexpect to lose his crop every few years from the devastations of these\r\nbeasts, that we have not yet realized that it would be profitable to spend\r\nvast sums of money in learning how to fight them.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of the race, this change will come about, and I feel that\r\nno honor is too great to bestow upon the American entomologists who have\r\nled the world in its fight with these enemies of the human race. Some day\r\nthese quiet, resourceful, far-sighted men of knowledge will take their\r\nplaces beside the organizers of industry and the warriors of mankind in\r\nthe hero worship of our boys and girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA BABY GRASSHOPPER\r\n\r\nA baby creature, scarcely two weeks since it issued from a grasshopper\r\negg, and yet with two moults behind it--two bright green baby skins cast\r\noff!\r\n\r\nImagine looking forward, as this baby creature does, to the day when its\r\ninternal air sacs shall be filled with air and the pads on its back have\r\ngrown so long and parchment-like that it can leave its hopping,\r\nterrestrial existence and sail away across the fields. Until that time,\r\nhowever, it must be content with its six spiny legs, pushing its way among\r\nthe blades of grass, tasting everything green and eating what it likes,\r\nand hiding from its enemies when moulting time comes round.\r\n\r\nA young chick finds itself shut inside the eggshell and must work its way\r\nout alone, but the young grasshoppers when they hatch out find\r\nthemselves--the whole nestful--shut in a hardened case in the ground made\r\nby their mother, and it takes half a dozen of them working together to\r\ndislodge the lid which shuts them in.\r\n\r\nUnlike the beetles and the butterflies, which spring full-fledged from the\r\nmetamorphosis of a caterpillar, the grasshopper comes to be a winged\r\ncreature by slow stages, each one a little more advanced than the former,\r\nwith wings a little better developed. The baby grasshopper is essentially\r\na small, wingless adult, and not a grub or larva in the ordinary sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA YOUNG GRASSHOPPER'S SKELETON\r\n\r\nWhen the young grasshopper emerges from the egg, it is very small\r\nindeed--a wingless, helpless little creature, all legs and mouth.\r\n\r\nIt passes through successive ages, or stages, as they are called, each one\r\nof which is separated from the other by a moult or casting of its outer\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThese moults take place at fixed periods, and as the insect finds itself\r\nrestrained by its firm, inelastic skeleton, a longitudinal rent occurs\r\nalong the back, and the insect, soft and dangerously helpless, struggles\r\nout of the old skin, inclosed in a new but delicate cuticle, which takes\r\nsome time to harden and color up.\r\n\r\nSome people go to great trouble and expense to keep the baby portraits and\r\neven the baby shoes, and I cannot help wondering whether a full-grown\r\ngrasshopper, leading a life in the open air, is ever interested in\r\nobserving the baby skeletons which show its five stages of terrestrial\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhat an interesting collection could be made of these insects' skeletons,\r\nphotographed large enough so that we could see and study them!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE GRASSHOPPER IS GOOD TO EAT\r\n\r\nHow much mere prejudice controls us! Whence came our aversion to the\r\nspotless, winged grasshopper as food and our fondness for the flesh of the\r\nwallowing swine? We thoughtlessly pass on to our children the idea that\r\ncertain things are not good to eat while others are, and so, although the\r\ngrasshopper has been eaten for centuries by millions of people, even by\r\nthe ancient Assyrians, and is today one of the candied delicacies of\r\nJapan, our American boys, hungry as they always are, have not yet caught\r\nthem to cook over their campfires.\r\n\r\nThe spiny legs deter us, perhaps, and yet, when one thinks that we eat up\r\nall of the soft-shelled crabs, sardines, reed birds and some other\r\ndelicacies, that seems to be no argument at all against the pasture fed\r\nand fattened locust of our summer time.\r\n\r\nIn Barbary, according to Miss Margaret Morley, the recipe in common use is\r\nto boil them for half an hour, remove the heads and wings and legs,\r\nsprinkle with salt and then fry them and season with vinegar to taste.\r\n\r\nThe Maoris of New Zealand, it is said, prefer them to the pigeons which\r\nthey raise.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouins bake then in a heated pit in the ground, much as a woodsman\r\ncooks his beans, and later dries them in the sun, then grinds them to\r\npowder and makes a kind of gruel, or else he eats them without grinding,\r\nsimply removing the legs and wings with his fingers as one would the shell\r\nof a shrimp.\r\n\r\nSome people say they taste like the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, while\r\nothers compare them in flavor to prawns.\r\n\r\nNow, whether all the different kinds are good or not, and which are best\r\nto eat are questions which the American boys most find out for\r\nthemselves--the girls, it is assumed, will take no part in this new field\r\nof cookery!\r\n\r\nShould any boy desire to dip into this vast subject and become an\r\nacridophagus it would take him back in his study to the hieroglyphics on\r\nsome of the oldest monuments of the human race and be a most fascinating\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA GRASSHOPPER'S EAR IS UNDER ITS WING\r\n\r\n(_Dissosteira carolina_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nIf you raise the wing of a full-grown grasshopper and look behind its big\r\nfat thigh, you will see a strange hole into its body. This is supposed to\r\nbe its ear, but what it hears and what it does not hear, who can tell?\r\n\r\nWhen on a warm summer day you hear a male grasshopper chirping, for the\r\nmales alone can sing, you can think that somewhere nearby, perhaps with\r\nwings lifted to hear the song better, sits some attentive female whose\r\nears are tuned to catch the plaintiveness of this courting song.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE GRASSHOPPER'S HEARING ORGAN\r\n\r\n(_Dissosteira carolina_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nAs we grow older and certain sounds which we heard in childhood with the\r\ngreatest ease become harder for us to hear and are finally lost to as\r\naltogether, we begin to appreciate the relative character of sound. Some\r\nboys can hear the faintest twitter of the shyest song bird in the tree\r\ntops, while others strain their ears in vain to catch its note.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder then that men should be puzzled to know just what the\r\ntrue grasshopper hears? They know there are males of certain species which\r\nsing so loud they make our ears ache, but there are others whose noises,\r\nif they make any, have never yet been heard by human ears, and yet they\r\nall have these ears. They believe, too, that there are certain sounds the\r\ngrasshopper can hear without the use of these special ears.\r\n\r\nSo whether this strange organ furnishes a special means by which the males\r\nand females find each other or not, and what part it has played throughout\r\nthe centuries in the development of this marvelous form of living matter,\r\nare things that man may be a long time yet in finding out.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph it lies to the left, a dark kidney-shaped opening with\r\nthe ear drum membrane at an angle just inside its rim. It has a\r\nwell-formed tympanum, and nerves and muscles of a complex nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT-WINGED GREEN LOCUST\r\n\r\n(_Dicromorpha viridis_, Scudd.)\r\n\r\nWhether this creature has a personality or not may be forever extremely\r\ndifficult for humans to decide. Its eyes that look like cows' eyes really\r\ncast hundreds of images on a special kind of brain, so different from our\r\nown that we cannot understand it, and then, besides these great big eyes,\r\nit has three others scarcely visible in the picture. Its short-ringed\r\nhorns are not horns at all, but sense organs of so complicated a nature\r\nthat we do not yet know certainly whether they are organs of smell or not,\r\nand it is supposed that they may be the seat of sense organs that we\r\nhumans do not have.\r\n\r\nThe jumping legs of the creature are filled with powerful muscles, which,\r\nwhen they expand, can hurl it through the air and enable it to escape from\r\nits enemies. On the inner side of the femur is a musical instrument, a row\r\nof hard, bead-like projections, which are very highly developed in the\r\nmales, but not at all in the females. When one of the veins of the upper\r\nwing, which is prominent and has a sharp knife edge, is scraped over these\r\nprojections, a musical sound is made by the vibration of the whole wing.\r\nIt would seem to be the case, as with so many of the birds, that only the\r\nmale can sing, the female being mute.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE KATYDID\r\n\r\n(_Scudderia sp._)\r\n\r\nHow marvelously equipped such a creature as this is to live! The great\r\neyes, with many facets, enable it to see by night as well as by day. Its\r\nlong, slender antennæ catch the faintest odor, and probably are sensitive\r\nto a host of perfumes that we do not know. In the front of each fore leg,\r\njust below the knee, is a dark, sunken area, the ear, with which it can\r\nprobably hear sounds too faint for our ears, and by moving them can tell\r\nfrom which direction the sounds come. Its long muscular legs enable it to\r\njump a hundred times its length whereas man can scarcely cover three times\r\nhis length at a leap. Its wings not only enable it to fly well, but in the\r\nmales are provided with an apparatus near their base for making a musical\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nThis sound is made by half opening the long green wings and closing them\r\nagain rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe left wing bears a file on its inner surface near the base, while the\r\nother, the right wing, has a sharp knife edge on the outside just below\r\nthe file on the left wing. In closing the wings together the knife edge\r\nscrapes across the file and makes at least one of the wings vibrate. While\r\nthe wings are opening no sound is produced; as they close the\r\ncharacteristic sounds so like the words \"Katy did\" are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE NARROW-WINGED KATYDID\r\n\r\n(_Scudderia sp._)\r\n\r\nIf it is any comfort for sleepless ones to know it, the katydid is one of\r\nthe noisiest creatures of its size in the world. It is only the males\r\nwhich call their \"Katy-did, Katy-didn't, she did, she didn't,\" and they\r\nare calling to their mates.\r\n\r\nThere are people who prefer the noises of the street-cars to the noises of\r\nNature, and who complain that the buzz of insect life on a summer evening\r\nmakes them feel lonesome and unhappy, but to me half the mystery and charm\r\nof tropical life lies in the music of the night insects. Our southern\r\nstates, with their tropical summers, have a wealth of insect life quite\r\ncomparable to that of the tropics and vastly more varied than that of\r\nnorthern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe katydid is the greatest songster of this night choir and is a truly\r\nAmerican species--as truly a thing to be proud of as the mocking-bird.\r\n\r\nLafcadio Hearn in his \"Kusa Hibari\" has put us in touch with the soul of a\r\nJapanese katydid, and if ours did not have quite so shrill a voice we too\r\nmight domesticate him, but the idea of caging an American katydid as the\r\nJapanese do their tiny-voiced creatures will not, I fear, appeal to the\r\naverage American citizen.\r\n\r\nThe male of this species sings sometimes by day as well as by night and\r\nhas different calls for day and night.\r\n\r\nThe female lays her eggs in the edges of leaves, thrusting them in between\r\nthe lower and upper cuticle, and from these hatch out the wingless,\r\nlong-legged green creatures which are hopping everywhere about the grass\r\nin early summer.\r\n\r\nThey are borne for the summer season only, and with the frosts of winter\r\nthey all die off. Nature seems to make just as complicated a being whether\r\nit is to last a score of minutes or a hundred years--one season or a\r\nhundred is all the same to her.\r\n\r\nJust why the katydid should want to hear its own song some city people may\r\nwonder, but it is evident that he does, for just below each knee, on his\r\nforemost legs, is to be found a well-developed ear with a tympanum which\r\nprobably vibrates much as ours do.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA YOUNG KATYDID\r\n\r\n(_Scudderia sp._)\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if there are any animals so largely legs as the young\r\nkatydid. It cannot fly yet, for the wings upon its back are still too\r\nsmall to carry it through the air, but it can escape from its enemies by\r\njumps which put those of a gazelle or a kangaroo to shame. The muscles in\r\nits legs are like our own muscles so far as can be determined, except that\r\nthey are attached to projections on the inside of a skeleton which encases\r\nthem all, instead of being attached to the outside of a skeleton which\r\nthey themselves encase, so when a katydid jumps one cannot see the muscles\r\nmove as one can those of a horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH\r\n\r\n(_Gryllus pennsylvanicus_, Burm.)\r\n\r\nThrough the ages, who knows if not from the times of the cave-dwellers,\r\nthis friendly visitor of the fireside has rubbed his rough wings together\r\nover his head and sung man to sleep. The European form seems quite as\r\ndomesticated as the cat or dog, leading nowhere a truly wild life, and it\r\nmay be questioned whether any living creature has become more a part of\r\nhuman life than the cricket on the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe carrying power of their song is extraordinary; there are species whose\r\nstrident notes can be heard for a mile, although their little bodies are\r\nscarcely more than an inch in length. The males alone are musical, and it\r\nis reasonable to suppose, since the females have ears in their fore legs,\r\nthat they are singing to their mates and not to mankind.\r\n\r\nAs one listens to their friendly song it is hard to appreciate what\r\nfighters they are among themselves, the larger ones even turning cannibals\r\nwhen food is scarce, although a glance at the photograph shows how well\r\nequipped they are for battle. Their great black eyes, only shinier black\r\nthan their coal-black armored necks, their jointed palpi with which they\r\nfeed themselves, their thick, leathery wings pressed against their sides\r\nlike a box cover, and their strong, muscular, spiny hind legs, with which\r\nthey jump a hundred times their own length, do none of them contribute to\r\nbeauty, though quite in keeping with their armored war-horse appearance.\r\n\r\nTwo long, flexible circi protrude like tails behind, but the task of\r\nfinding out what they are for has been too difficult for man. Perhaps the\r\nstrange nerve-ending hairs which they bristle with may be sensitive to\r\nvibrations of the air, of which we yet know nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE GROUND CRICKET\r\n\r\nUnlike its jet black relative of the fireside, the striped ground cricket\r\nforages by day on grassy slopes. It is a more omnivorous scavenger than\r\nthe hyena, for it eats decaying plants as well as animals.\r\n\r\nIts big brown eyes, which cover half its head, see, doubtless, many ways\r\nat once, and its long, whiplike antennæ, which it waves constantly as it\r\nsprings through the grass, are believed to scent odors which are\r\ninconceivably faint, such as the odor of a blade of grass, a pebble, or a\r\ndecaying leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE STONE OR CAMEL CRICKET\r\n\r\n(_Ceuthophilus uhleri_, Scudd.)\r\n\r\nIt would not be a good idea to let the children think that creatures such\r\nas this were prowling round the house at night--that is, unless you assure\r\nthem that it is only a harmless, tawny yellow stone-cricket from the shady\r\nwoods, where it generally hides under stones and damp, decaying logs.\r\n\r\nIt seems strangely equipped for its night life, for it has antennæ as long\r\nas its body. I cannot help wondering if these help it to jump in the dark.\r\nFabre, the great French entomologist, has tried, as others have, to find\r\nout just how the insects use their antennæ and what they are really for.\r\nHe says at last, \"our senses do not represent all the ways by which the\r\nanimal puts himself in touch with that which is not himself; there are\r\nother ways of doing it, perhaps many, not even remotely analogous to those\r\nwhich we ourselves possess.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA MONSTER OF THE UNDERWORLD: THE MOLE CRICKET\r\n\r\n(_Gryllotalpa borealis_, Burm.)\r\n\r\nThe creatures of the air which hide away their eggs that their larvæ may\r\nhatch out underneath the ground must reckon with this burrowing beast.\r\n\r\nAll his life long he tunnels beneath the ground from place to place. When\r\nyou think of how long it would take you, even with the best tools, to dig\r\na hole in the ground big enough to crawl into, you will get some idea of\r\nthe power which these two front legs, four-pointed like a spading fork,\r\nmust have, to enable such a creature to disappear into the ground in a few\r\nseconds as he does. These paws, proportionately many times more powerful\r\nthan bears' paws, are snippers too, for moving back and forth behind them\r\nis a sharp-edged instrument which, like the shuttle-bar on a mowing\r\nmachine, shears off the grass roots which interfere with the mole\r\ncricket's progress through the ground. The poor defenseless angleworms\r\nmust fall an easy prey to such a foe as this!\r\n\r\nUpon the first joint of each clumsy front leg, it has a narrow slit-like\r\near which is but faintly visible in the photograph. Can you imagine a male\r\nand female calling to each other through the long and winding passageways\r\nbeneath the ground? Possibly they call to each other only in the\r\nnight-time, on the rare occasions when they venture out above the ground.\r\n\r\nHe is a curious creature with eyes that are only rudimentary and a noxious\r\nsmell that he emits if he is touched.\r\n\r\nThe female excavates a chamber near the surface of the ground and lays her\r\neggs in it to be incubated by the sun's heat, as are most insects' eggs.\r\n\r\nFor some time it was supposed that both parents devoured their progeny, as\r\nmany as 90 per cent being eaten up, but a French observer, Monsieur\r\nDecaux, has found that the male alone is the cannibal and the mother, far\r\nfrom doing this, watches over them and when they hatch she feeds the\r\nlittle ones with bits of plant roots, earthworms and the larvæ of various\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of one of these mole crickets is really an event. Most\r\npeople see but one or two in all their lives. In Porto Rico, however,\r\nthere is a form with longer wings which eats the roots of sugar cane,\r\ntobacco and other crops so that the \"changa,\" as it is called, is\r\nconsidered the most serious insect pest in the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE COCKROACH\r\n\r\n(_Blatella germanica_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nIn carboniferous times this was a dominant creature, crawling over the\r\ngiant club mosses and tree ferns which composed the marshy vegetation of\r\nthe young world. Today it crawls over the cracker-box and makes its way\r\nthrough every crevice in the kitchen and is, of all the creatures of our\r\nhouses, the most detested. This is the German cockroach, an importation\r\nfrom Europe, which has spread around the world, and which New Yorkers know\r\nas the croton bug.\r\n\r\nIts long, spiny legs are built for the scurrying for which it is noted,\r\nwhile its slippery body enables it to squeeze through crevices and holes.\r\nIt carries its head tucked under its body, as if looking for food, and its\r\nwhiplike antennæ, always in motion, detect at long range the presence of\r\nanything edible which can be crammed into its capacious crop.\r\n\r\nHousewives may be surprised to learn that a cockroach can live five years,\r\nand that it takes a year to develop to maturity from the egg. The female\r\nlays her eggs in a horny capsule, like a spectacle case, which she carries\r\nabout with her until she is ready to deposit it in some suitable place.\r\nLater she returns to help her cockroach babies out of their shells.\r\n\r\nLike the cricket, cockroaches love the night and shun the daylight. They\r\ncannot tolerate cold weather, and though there are 5,000 species they\r\nmostly inhabit the tropics, where they are the plague of domestic and ship\r\nlife. It is said that \"ships come into San Francisco from their long\r\nhalf-year voyages around the Horn with the sailors wearing gloves on their\r\nhands when asleep in their bunks in a desperate effort to save their\r\nfingernails from being gnawed off by the hordes of roaches which infest\r\nthe whole ship.\" (Kellogg.)\r\n\r\nAnd now a rumor comes to us that the cockroach carries cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA DEMON FLY KILLER: THE PRAYING MANTIS\r\n\r\n(_Paratenodera sinensis_, Sauss.)\r\n\r\nIts spiny fore legs are built to hold the struggling flies, while, with\r\nits sharp jaws, it tears them to pieces much as a hawk or eagle holds its\r\nprey with its talons and tears it to shreds with its beak. It is wasteful,\r\ntoo, of its food, as wasteful as the sea lion, or the seal, throwing away\r\nthe half-consumed carcass before it is finished and pursuing another\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nSo voracious is its appetite and so successful is it as a hunter that\r\nDoctor Slingerland of Cornell has introduced the eggs of a species of this\r\nmantis from Europe and distributed them among his friends in the Northern\r\nstates as a beneficial insect.\r\n\r\nTo kill a praying mantis has been in Mohammedan countries almost as great\r\na crime as it is to kill an albatross at sea, but this was not because it\r\nkills the swarms of flies so common in those lands, but rather because of\r\nthe prayerful attitude made necessary by its fiercely spined and powerful\r\nfront legs.\r\n\r\nIts head is so loosely set on its long neck, or thorax, that it can move\r\nit from side to side with the greatest ease. Fabre declares that \"the\r\nmantis is alone among all the insects in directing its attention to\r\ninanimate things. It inspects, it examines, it has almost a physiognomy.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps one is warranted in having a feeling of repugnance toward the\r\nmantis, for no other living creature has more horrible habits. There has\r\nalways been something horrible about the cannibalism of human beings who\r\nate their enemies killed in battle, but this has never seemed so revolting\r\nas the practice of the Fijians who killed members of their own tribe in\r\ncold blood for purposes of the cannibal feast. The female mantis goes a\r\nstep farther than this, for she begins eating her lover even before the\r\ncourtship is over.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing about the spiders, terrifying though they must appear to\r\ntheir defenseless prey, to indicate that they try consciously to frighten\r\ntheir victims, but the mantis, by spreading out its wings and curling up\r\nits abdomen, and raising its talon-tipped, spiny legs, seems to\r\ndeliberately petrify with terror the cricket or grasshopper which comes\r\nwithin its reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF THE BUGS\r\n\r\n(_Hemiptera_)\r\n\r\nHow blind mankind must seem to the insect world! To look at beetles with\r\ntheir massive jaws and armor-plated bodies, or flies with their gauzy\r\nwings, or grasshoppers with their long jumping legs and then class them\r\nall as bugs, must seem to them incomprehensible, for to be a bug, an\r\ninsect must have a sharp pointed beak, whatever else it has. It may or may\r\nnot have wings, it may have a larval stage or it may not, but if it hasn't\r\na beak and can't suck then it can't be classed as a true bug.\r\n\r\nThese sucking insects of many shapes, although directly connected with the\r\nwelfare of the human race, have been, until recently, the least known of\r\nthe great orders of insects.\r\n\r\nTo this order belong the chinch bugs, the cause of an estimated loss to\r\nthe grain growers of twenty million dollars a year; the great Phylloxera,\r\nwhich destroyed the vines on three million acres of French vineyards, and\r\nthe San José scale, which has spread during the past ten years through\r\nevery state and territory in the United States and become a menace to the\r\nfruit-growing industry.\r\n\r\nIt is of this order of the insect world that David Sharp remarks \"... if\r\nany thing were to exterminate the enemies of Hemiptera we ourselves would\r\nprobably be starved in a few months.\" It does seem strange in face of all\r\nthese statements of authority that our best friends, the insectivorous\r\nbirds, are being killed out for lack of forest refuge. We spend millions\r\nto fight the pests when once they get the upper hand, but pay little or no\r\nattention to the comforts of those tireless workers, the birds, which\r\nwould keep them down.\r\n\r\nI am ashamed of such a fragmentary picture showing of this most important\r\norder, and hope someone will follow on with a bug book which will do the\r\nsubject justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE SQUASH BUG\r\n\r\n(_Anasa tristis_, De G.)\r\n\r\nThe smell of the squash bug is known to every country boy. The odor is\r\nemitted through openings in the abdomen from special stink glands, which\r\nvary with each species.\r\n\r\nThe tough external skeleton explains, perhaps, why no spray is strong\r\nenough to kill the fully grown insects without also injuring the young\r\nsquash and pumpkin vines, and why the best method of prevention consists\r\nin screening the young plants with a wire screen until they have grown\r\nlarge enough to be immune from attack. If you can find the young insects\r\nwhich are not yet encased in such a hardened shell, spraying with a 10 per\r\ncent kerosene emulsion will stop up their breathing pores and asphyxiate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe one in the picture is an old specimen, preparing to go into winter\r\nquarters under the leaves and wait for the tender squash and pumpkin vines\r\nto appear above the ground next spring.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how quickly they find these juicy shoots, which they\r\npierce with their sucking beaks and upon which they lay the eggs which in\r\na few days hatch out into a brood of small but voracious squash bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA STRANGE-SHAPED BUG\r\n\r\n(_Euschistus tristigmus_, Say)\r\n\r\nA strange-shaped bug walked into the laboratory to have his picture taken,\r\nnot willing, evidently, that he should be left out of the collection. The\r\nhandbooks on entomology which I possess seem not to have heard of him. He\r\nis just a common, ordinary bug, but he, doubtless, has an interesting life\r\nfor all our scorning of his acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA QUEER, UNWORLDLY MONSTER\r\n\r\n(_Corynocoris distinctus_, Dallas)\r\n\r\nCould anything be more antediluvian and unworldly than this old,\r\nbroken-down creature, with six crooked legs, a pair of popping-out eyes,\r\ntwo shining ocelli which look straight up into the air, and a long, stout\r\nbeak that is partly hidden behind one of the fore legs?\r\n\r\nA discussion of how such a fright of a thing came into existence leads one\r\ninto the realms of evolutionary science, and there we should perhaps find\r\nit suggested that it is so ugly and looks so much like the bark of the\r\ntrees on which it roosts that birds have passed its ancient forefather by,\r\nand through the weird workings of that little-understood law of heredity\r\nthis thorny, spotted creature has waddled along year after year, keeping\r\nup in the race for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of centuries. I cannot\r\nhelp exhibiting a little of the showman's pride in it; for, as Barnum\r\nwould say, this is positively the first real appearance of this\r\ncentury-hidden, hoary monster before the everyday public.\r\n\r\nAccording to the books, this species belongs to a strange family, in which\r\nare even more remarkable-looking creatures. They are all, however,\r\ncharacterized by having the femora of their back legs covered with knobs\r\nor spines. One of the species is so spiny all over its back that the male\r\nmakes use of it to carry around the freshly laid eggs of the female.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE THREAD-LEGGED BUG\r\n\r\n(_Emesa longipes_, De G.)\r\n\r\nWhen you consider how slight a jar of a spider's web will bring its maker\r\nrunning swiftly across the web, it is interesting to be told that this\r\nthread-legged bug has the temerity to pick off insects from a spider's\r\nweb. It is plain that he stands on stilts, and with his powerful tong-like\r\nfront legs, which end in spiny gripping hands, he must, I imagine, reach\r\nout across the web and pick the smaller insects from it, for he is much\r\ntoo small and weak and incredibly fragile to fight a spider on its own\r\nweb.\r\n\r\nEven to someone fairly familiar with the insect world he might easily be\r\nmistaken for a mantis, but his short, sharp beak, bent backwards under his\r\nchin, puts him among the bugs, where he takes his place beside the\r\nassassin bugs.\r\n\r\nIn one form of thread-legged bug in South America, it is said that the\r\nyoung larva is so long and slender that it curls itself around the\r\nmother's body and is carried about with her, papoose-like, on her back.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE ASSASSIN BUG\r\n\r\n(_Pselliopus cinctus_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nThe human species puts its assassins into striped clothing and it is a\r\nrather curious coincidence to find in the insect world an assassin bug in\r\nconvict's stripes.\r\n\r\nI think no visitor to our portrait gallery has seen a more fantastic being\r\nthan this little bow-legged beast. Until I found out what he was, I could\r\nnot understand his rank impertinence, for he stalked leisurely about as\r\nthough afraid of nothing.\r\n\r\nI wonder if he has a nasty flavor and advertises the fact by his curious\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN ASSASSINATION\r\n\r\n(_Pselliopus cinctus_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nI once took a photograph, without realizing it, of some Arab women at the\r\ngates of Bagdad, trying to assassinate an old man; and I cannot pass the\r\npicture in my album without shuddering.\r\n\r\nThis photograph affects me in the same way, for it, too, is of a real\r\ntragedy and portrays the death of a ladybird, one of the few friends man\r\nhas in the whole order of beetles, and that, too, at the hands of a member\r\nof the order of bugs, the most destructive order of our insect pests.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that, as things go in Nature, the ladybird has met her\r\njust fate, for she has spent her life devouring bugs, the sucking aphids\r\nand scale insects of our rose bushes and cherry trees. Somehow the old\r\nnursery rhyme of\r\n\r\n  \"Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home,\r\n    Your house is on fire, your children will burn,\"\r\n\r\nseems to have endeared to us all this beneficent little beetle which\r\nwanders everywhere, cutting short the lives of the sap-sucking insects\r\nthat deform and injure our plants, and it does not seem to matter that\r\nthis particular assassin bug preys upon our enemies as well as on our\r\nfriends. To find this convict striped, spiny bug, with its beak buried to\r\nthe base in the vitals of the ladybird, and realize that it had first\r\npoisoned its victim with poison saliva and was now sucking its blood,\r\nrouses a peculiar feeling of hatred towards this hideously ugly creature.\r\nPerhaps this is heightened by the contrast between the pretty, trim form\r\nof the ladybird and the ugliness of the assassin bug.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled to know how a creature so nearly armor-clad could be\r\nsuccessfully attacked by a soft-bodied bug of such deliberate habits of\r\nmovement. How the start is made I do not know, but it is evident that\r\nbetween the base of the wing covers of the ladybird and her neck or thorax\r\nis a weak spot in her armor and the assassin thrusts his beak into this\r\ncrack.\r\n\r\nThere are members of this assassin bug class which do not hesitate to\r\nattack little children in the South, and produce nasty wounds with their\r\npoisoned beaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA\r\n\r\n(_Cicada sayi_, Grossb.)\r\n\r\nThe coming of the swallow is scarcely more significant to Americans of the\r\nSouthern states than the arrival of the cicada. Its song is the noisiest\r\nsong in the insect world, and is made in a curious way, by the stretching\r\nand relaxing of a corrugated drum-like membrane in the side of the abdomen\r\nby means of specially strong muscles. The sound is controlled in rhythmic\r\ncadences by means of semicircular discs or covers to the drums, which can\r\nbe closed and opened at the will of the insect.\r\n\r\nThis noisy song, which the male alone can sing, he doubtless sings for his\r\nmate and not for us, although entomologists are not agreed as to how his\r\npartner hears his song, as she seems to have no ears. Although this is the\r\nphotograph of a two-year cicada the story can be told here of that\r\nweirdest of all the insects,--the Rip Van Winkle of the insect world, as\r\nDavid Sharp has called it,--the seventeen-year cicada.\r\n\r\nFrom a tiny egg laid by its mother in a twig of your back-yard shrubbery\r\nthere issues a creature which is as unlike this monster as it can be, with\r\nsoft, white body and mole-like front legs. It hurries to the ground and\r\ndisappears beneath its surface sometimes to a depth of a hundred times its\r\nlength--twenty feet it is said. For seventeen years it digs its way around\r\nin the absolute darkness of this underworld, and then, as though by some\r\nprearranged agreement, it comes to the surface to join in a marriage\r\nrevelry of a few brief weeks in summer with its kinsmen of the same\r\ngeneration who disappeared as it did into the darkness seventeen years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMost insects live for a few months only, and one, indeed, the male at\r\nleast, for only fifteen or twenty minutes; but the seventeen-year cicada,\r\nthe oldest of the insect world, lives as long as a cat or dog. But what a\r\nlife! Seventeen years of it in the dark and a few weeks in the sunlight.\r\nAnd yet, compared to the life of an angleworm, condemned to the darkness\r\nforever, what an interesting career!\r\n\r\nWhen the cicada's shrill song disturbs you, then remember how brief is the\r\npleasure of its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE AMBUSH BUG\r\n\r\n(_Phymata pennsylvanica_, Handl.)\r\n\r\nWe are personally so afraid of a bee's sting that it is hard for us to\r\nbelieve that any mere bug exists which is strong enough to overcome and\r\nkill a wasp or honey bee. A look at the thick armor of this creature and\r\nits powerful, black pointed beak will go a long way towards convincing one\r\nthat this may be such a bug; it has a close relative, anyway, which does\r\nso. Its front legs have been developed into enormously strong claws with\r\nwhich to catch and hold its prey.\r\n\r\nIt lurks in flowers and preys on honey-sucking insects, and one can easily\r\nimagine the unequal struggle between it and a butterfly, or realize that\r\nit might come off victor in a fight with bees or wasps.\r\n\r\nThere are such romantic scenes and bloodcurdling spectacles to be observed\r\nin this world of insects that I cannot understand why there are so few\r\nwho, having ample time, have not the patience to sit and watch them as\r\nFabre and others less well known have done.\r\n\r\nNo schoolroom training in observation can compare in value with the\r\noutdoor observations of living insects. To look and wait and think and try\r\nto understand; what habits of observation, perseverance and reflection\r\nthese actions cultivate!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA BUG THAT IS ALWAYS WALKING AROUND\r\n\r\n(_Brochymena arborea_, Say)\r\n\r\nNo photograph in the collection illustrates better the marvelous variety\r\nof form which abounds in the jungle of our back yards. To the naked eye\r\nall the interesting details are invisible and one's hand instinctively\r\nbrushes the intruder from the table where it has crawled in to take a look\r\nat a human being.\r\n\r\nThe spotted, crablike legs, covered with bristles, the beadlike facet\r\neyes, the oyster shell shaped body, the moving antennæ all covered with\r\nwhite scales, the curious trunk or sucking pipe descending from the chin,\r\ngive to the creature a personality which combines something of the wistful\r\nwith the curious. And yet this is, as my friend Dr. Schwartz says, \"just\r\none of those bugs that is always walking around on our plants and nobody\r\nseems to know just what it is doing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE TARNISHED PLANT BUG\r\n\r\n(_Lygus pratensis_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nIf you have ever carefully tended young vegetable plants, set them out by\r\nhand and watched over them, you will certainly have made the acquaintance\r\nof this vicious little creature a quarter of an inch long. At least you\r\nwill have found where he drove his proboscis and sucked the juices from\r\nyour tender plant, leaving his irritating fluids behind to distort the\r\ntissues of the leaf or bud. He lives in the rubbish which was left\r\nlittering up the garden and is waiting now for spring to come when he will\r\nmake his appearance and do whatever damage is necessary for his existence.\r\nYou cannot spray him with kerosene for he is too agile, skipping away from\r\nyou in the sunlight, but when his mate lays her eggs, and the young nymphs\r\nwith wingless bodies crawl about, you can kill them with a dose of\r\nkerosene oil emulsion which will close their breathing pores and suffocate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE LANTERN FLY BUG\r\n\r\n(_Helicoptera variegata_, Van D.)\r\n\r\nThis creature belongs to the family of lantern flies and is also related\r\nto the little leaf hoppers which one startles from the grass by the\r\nhundred in walking across a lawn or meadow.\r\n\r\nIt is a small, grey bug, not a quarter of an inch long, and quite\r\ninsignificant when looked at with the naked eye, yet it is quite as\r\nstrange in form as any of the prehistoric monsters.\r\n\r\nIts powerful beak is made up, as are the beaks of all the great order of\r\nsucking insects, of four hairlike bodies, four fine, flexible, closely\r\nconnected rods enclosed in a narrow groove and sharp enough to puncture\r\nthe skin of a succulent young plant. Not only are these hairlike rods as\r\nsharp as needles, but the outer pair are usually barbed so that, once\r\nintroduced, a hold is easily maintained.\r\n\r\nUnder the throat is an organ of the nature of a force pump which injects\r\nan irritating fluid into the plant. It is supposed that this gives rise to\r\nan irritation or congestion of the plant tissue, and thus keeps up a\r\nsupply of liquid food for the bug at the point operated upon, which,\r\nrising by capillary attraction along the grooved rods, finds its way into\r\nthe stomach of the insect.\r\n\r\nThat these leaf-sucking insects inject a poison is shown by the way in\r\nwhich the punctured leaves curl up, turn brown and die.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEETLES\r\n\r\n(_Coleoptera_)\r\n\r\nBeetles are distinguished from the other orders of flying creatures by\r\nhaving the first pair of wings changed into shells under which the other\r\npair can be safely folded and laid away. You can usually recognize them\r\nwhen they spread their wings to fly, for they have to raise their wing\r\ncovers in order to do so. Also they generally have prominent jaws, as they\r\nare biting creatures and do not suck the juices of plants and animals as\r\nthe bugs do.\r\n\r\nBeetles are almost everywhere. You cannot turn over a stone or break down\r\na stump or roll over a log without disturbing some of them, and yet\r\nperhaps less is known about the lives of beetles than about those of any\r\nother of the great orders of insects.\r\n\r\nThey lead two lives, distinct as two lives can be: one in the form of a\r\ngrub, the other as a full-grown beetle. To make the transformation, they\r\nburrow into the ground or into the wood of trees and but rarely make for\r\nthemselves silken cocoons such as the butterfly larvæ spin.\r\n\r\nThey do not lead so aerial an existence as some other orders, but,\r\nnevertheless, they are today, perhaps because of their closely fitting\r\nouter shells, the predominant order of insects of the present epoch and\r\nalready there are known the bewildering number of 150,000 species. In\r\nNorth America alone (Mexico excepted) 12,000 species have been described\r\nand these have been grouped into eighty families and 2,000 genera. The\r\ngeneral public is beginning to realize that not everyone can be an\r\nentomologist, and that the quality of brains and training required before\r\none can travel safely among this maze of forms and distinguish between the\r\nfriends and foes of our agriculture is a quality of the greatest value to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nSo far as man is concerned, this gigantic class of creatures is among the\r\nmost destructive with which we divide life on this planet, and though\r\nthere are beetle friends which help us by preying on other beetles and by\r\nmaking humus out of leaves and twigs, and by feeding millions of our song\r\nbirds, yet, as a whole, they represent a restless, armored multitude which\r\nperhaps we should be just as well without.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE JUNE BEETLE\r\n\r\n(_Allorhina nitida_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nIn looking at these two strange beings (this picture and the next), we\r\ncannot feel confident that science has gone very far in giving us the\r\nreasons for the things we see. They seem no more alike than fish and\r\ntortoise or bird and quadruped and yet, before our very eyes, in one brief\r\nyear, the one turns into the other.\r\n\r\nThis beetle dies, and leaves behind a hundred little cells, parts of its\r\nown body and the body of its mate. These paired cells, the fertilized\r\neggs, grow rapidly into the form of the clumsy, helpless grub which feeds\r\nupon the leaves, only to break up and form themselves again into this\r\narmor-plated creature of the beetle world.\r\n\r\nThere must be something as radically wrong with our individualistic ideas\r\nof today as there was with the conception of a flat world which prevailed\r\nbefore the time of Columbus. Perhaps if we stop trying to think of these\r\nmanifestations of beetle life as individuals and think of them as parts of\r\none great organism scattered over the surface of the earth, these striking\r\ndifferences will seem no stranger to us than do the differences in the\r\nvarious stages of a flower's life. The beetle forms inside the grub and\r\nthe tulip flower bud forms inside the bulb. If tulip flowers could fly, we\r\nshould then have the strange spectacle of the opening of the scale-covered\r\ntulip bulb and the coming forth of the gorgeous colored flower which\r\nsailed away to shed its seeds in someone else's garden. I think that this\r\nis the way we must look at it if we would get a clear idea of this\r\nstrangest of phenomena,--metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE JUNE BEETLE LARVA\r\n\r\n(_Allorhina nitida_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nHow is it possible that this fat creature, with eye-like breathing pores\r\nalong its body, whose legs are worthless, and which is so helpless that it\r\nhas to turn over on its back to wriggle over the ground, can change into\r\nthe emerald-green June beetle which wings its way like an aerodrome across\r\nthe meadow? This is the apparent miracle of metamorphosis which it has\r\nwell-nigh baffled the intellect of man to explain.\r\n\r\nThough the reasons for it are still unknown, modern research has shown us\r\nhow this incredible change has taken place.\r\n\r\nWhen this creature, which has grown a hundred times its size since it was\r\nborn, has reached the age for this great change, it doubtless feels the\r\nimpending transformation coming, and instinct tells it to crawl away into\r\nsome protected nook or corner and pupate underneath the protection of a\r\nsilken coverlid of its own spinning.\r\n\r\nThe change begins; each organ goes to pieces, disintegrates, becomes a\r\nmass of disconnected cells, so that the body filled with these, becomes,\r\nas it were, a bag of mush. This mushy fluid has been likened by\r\nentomologists to the disintegrated tissues which inflammation causes in\r\nour own bodies. If, then, you should slit it open at this stage, you would\r\nfind no alimentary canal, no salivary glands, no muscles, simply a thick\r\nfluid, with here and there a thicker lump, that is attached at certain\r\nplaces to the inside of the sac wall. These lumps are formed of groups of\r\nactive cells which were not disintegrated in the general breakdown of the\r\nmuscle tissue, and these form the nuclei around which the new creature is\r\nto be built. These groups of cells grow rapidly, feeding on the fluid mass\r\nof broken-down tissue much as a young chick inside the egg feeds on the\r\nyolk, and builds up the whole complicated structure of the winged beetle,\r\nwhich seems to have no possible relations to the white grub out of whose\r\nbody it was made.\r\n\r\nIt is as though the insect hatched twice, first from the almost\r\nmicroscopic egg its mother laid and from which it emerged as a tiny little\r\ncreature in the image of this grub, growing and manufacturing from the\r\nleaves it eats enough nitrogenous matter so that when it emerges again\r\nfrom the yolk-like substance of its cocoon it will be a full-grown beetle,\r\nfor it must be remembered that once made the beetle never grows.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful process is the same which is gone through by every flying\r\ninsect that has a grub or caterpillar stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE JUNE BUGS OR MAY BEETLES\r\n\r\n(_Lachnosterna quercus_, Knoch)\r\n\r\nOf the wild creatures of our back yards, none is better known than this\r\nhard-shelled buzzing creature, which whirs into the circle of light around\r\nyour lamp and commits suicide, if you will let it, by flying into the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the so-called June bugs, or May beetles, which every boy and\r\ngirl knows, and is not the June _beetle_ of which the larva was shown\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nIts hard, pitted skeleton covers it completely, and it is most interesting\r\nto watch it open its wing covers with great deliberation, unfold the wings\r\nwhich are carefully stowed away beneath them, and holding its wing covers\r\nelevated so they will not interfere, start the transparent wings into\r\nmotion and fly away with the whir of a miniature aerodrome. Indeed, it was\r\nthis resemblance which caused the members of the Aerial Experiment\r\nAssociation to name one of their first aerodromes after it, and the first\r\ntrophy ever given for an aerodrome flight was won by Curtis's \"June Bug.\"\r\n\r\nThis creature's first life is spent beneath the sod of your lawn, where it\r\ncurls up around the roots of the grasses and clover and other plants which\r\nyou do not want it to eat, and the first year of its subterranean\r\nexistence it is the white grub, with the brown head, which everybody\r\nknows. At the end of the second summer of its life it changes to a soft\r\nbrown beetle, which throughout the winter is hardening its shell\r\npreparatory to coming out in late spring as a winged creature to feed upon\r\nthe leaves of trees. The beetle which is walking toward you lives upon the\r\noak.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE TWIG-PRUNERS\r\n\r\n(_Elaphidion atomaricum_, Dru.)\r\n\r\nThe long-horned beetles, as they are called, are remarkable for the length\r\nof their antennæ and for their eyes of many facets, which almost encircle\r\nthe antennæ at their base. They have, like other beetles, two lives, so to\r\nspeak, and their grub-life is spent inside some twig or branch, burrowing\r\nand living on the juices which their stomachs extract from the sawdust\r\nmade by their jaws. They kill the twig they burrow in, so that the wind\r\nblows it to the ground, and they go through their transformation on the\r\nground. The story is told of a long-horned beetle, belonging to a\r\ndifferent species, that lived for years in its larval stage, burrowing\r\npatiently into the dry wood of a boot-last or shoe-stretcher, trying\r\nvainly to get enough nourishment out of it to make a beetle of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE PREDACEOUS GROUND BEETLE\r\n\r\n(_Chlænius æstivus_, Say)\r\n\r\nThis creature almost anyone will recognize as a beetle. It is built for\r\nrunning, and its jaws are made for fighting. You have only to catch one\r\nand watch it open and shut its jaws to realize that it would bite you if\r\nit could. But for all that it is a great friend, for it is what the\r\nentomologists call predaceous, and at night or at twilight it hunts\r\neverywhere for the larvæ of insects which attack the plants we live on. In\r\nits larval state, in which it looks for all the world like a centiped\r\nwithout the \"ped,\" it burrows in the ground in search of the plant\r\ndestroyers, which think to escape notice by getting under the cover of the\r\nsoil. It is by nature, then, opposed to the vegetarians, the herbivores,\r\nand hunts them wherever they are likely to occur.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a black or dark-brown beetle running swiftly from under some\r\nstone or log whirls you have just turned over and which makes faces with\r\nits jaws as though it would chew your fingers when you pick it up, you can\r\nbe quite sure in eight times out of ten that it is one of these carabidæ\r\nor predaceous ground beetles, and if you let it drop from your fingers you\r\nmay be saving the life of a friend, because some day it may eat the worm\r\nwhich, lying close to some pet flower of yours, had planned to cut it off\r\nbeneath the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the hardest things in all the world to understand how\r\nbalanced is this scale of foe and friend. One year there is a wiping out\r\nof our insect friends through frost or floods or microscopic disease, and,\r\nfreed thus from the check which kept their numbers down, the foes to our\r\nplants can multiply to such an extent that nothing we can do will save our\r\ncrops from total failure. Next year, perhaps, the parasitic beetle,\r\nfinding such a wealth of food to live upon, increases and holds well in\r\ncheck the pest which last year ate up all our plants. Each wave of insect\r\npests could be explained, no doubt, if all the facts were known, and\r\nnowadays no one who knows what modern agriculture means will fail to\r\nreckon on the risks from losses caused by these pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CLOVER LEAF WEEVIL\r\n\r\n(_Phytonomus punctatus_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nCould anyone suspect this modest antediluvian creature coming toward you\r\nout of the gloom, hanging his head, as it were, of any designs against\r\nanyone? He has them, however, and if you will examine your clover leaves\r\nin June you will find them scalloped with irregular patches eaten out of\r\nthem. It would be easy for him to prove an alibi, since it is his other\r\nself, his larval existence, which does it and does it at night, too,\r\ncoming up out of the base of the clover plant where it hides during the\r\ndaytime. Occasionally in August he can himself be seen feeding on the\r\nclover leaves. In his two existences he manages to do a good deal of\r\ndamage to the clover fields of the farmer, necessitating the plowing up of\r\nold fields when he becomes too numerous.\r\n\r\nBut let us look at the company he keeps. He is in the same class with the\r\nalfalfa weevil which came over from central Asia recently and spread\r\nthrough the alfalfa fields of Utah, threatened the alfalfa growers with\r\nruin and set the Entomological Bureau of the Government out on the trail\r\nof some parasite, some enemy of his which they were sure must have held\r\nhim in check in his native land. If you could have heard the conferences\r\nwhich were held and the drastic measures relating to traffic which were\r\nproposed you would realize that it is no child's play to fight the Asiatic\r\nrelative of this modest-looking creature.\r\n\r\nBut it has in this country worse relatives even than the alfalfa weevil.\r\nIt is related to the cotton boll weevil, which has brought thousands of\r\nfamilies in the South to the point of starvation and drawn millions of\r\ndollars from the federal treasury of the country in an effort to fight it\r\nand lessen its ravages throughout the cotton belt of the Southern states.\r\nThousands of lectures are being given to tell the farmers what its habits\r\nare and how it can be prevented.\r\n\r\nIt has other more distant relatives which live in the forest trees and\r\nmake wonderful burrows which look like hieroglyphics. As that remarkable\r\nentomologist, Hubbard, discovered, they are cultivators of microscopic\r\nmushrooms as wonderful as those of the mushroom nests of the atta ants or\r\nthe termites of the tropics. Incidentally, and this is the important\r\npoint, they kill the trees, fires start in the dead trees, and it is\r\nestimated roughly by Dr. Hopkins, the Forest Entomologist, that they\r\ndestroy over a hundred million dollars' worth of timber annually or, at\r\nleast, are one of the principal causes of this gigantic loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE SPOTTED VINE CHAFER IN FLIGHT\r\n\r\n(_Pelidnota punctata_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nHow often one sees lame butterflies limping along in their flight, because\r\ntheir wings have been injured by the rose bushes or by striking against\r\nthe pine needles or have been nipped by some hungry bird. The beetles,\r\nwhen they alight, carefully fold up each delicate wing, close down over\r\nthem polished covers as hard almost as steel and fitting as closely as the\r\nengine covers of an automobile. Whether these wing covers act as\r\naeroplanes or as rudders for the beetles when in flight is as yet unknown.\r\nThere are strange, almost microscopic, markings over the surface of these\r\nwing covers and in some species there are glands inside them which secrete\r\na fluid which reaches the surface through minute pores, but the use of\r\nthis fluid we are still unable to discover.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the discovery, if we may so term it, of these\r\nwing-protecting shells, has been of tremendous advantage to the class of\r\norganisms where it first appeared. At any rate, among the insects the\r\norder of beetles (Coleoptera) is the predominating one of this epoch.\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks that man has just begun to fly, whereas the beetles flew\r\nperhaps a hundred million years or more ago, these wings and their most\r\nperfect chitinized wing covers are deserving of our wonder and of our\r\nadmiration, too.\r\n\r\nThis light, yellowish brown and black spotted beetle prefers the leaves of\r\nthe grape vine to those of any other plant, and in its grub life it\r\nburrows in rotten wood, especially in decaying roots of apple, pear and\r\nhickory trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE BLISTER OR CANTHARIDES BEETLES\r\n\r\n(_Epicanta marginata_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nI can never look at this beetle without a feeling of emotion, for in a\r\ndesperate struggle to escape from the fate predestined by a bald-headed\r\nancestry, I once submitted to the treatment of a noted hair specialist and\r\nallowed him to apply to my scalp the acrid oil of the blister beetle. And\r\nthe melancholy part is that it did no good.\r\n\r\nFabre has described how the female European blister beetle lays a thousand\r\nor two eggs in the ground in close proximity to the nest of the solitary\r\nbee whose eggs form the only food of the blister beetle larva. From the\r\nbeetles' eggs hatch out strong-jawed, six-legged spiny larvæ called\r\ntriangulins. Although born close to the nests of the bees, which in this\r\ncase are in the ground, these triangulins do not enter the nests, but\r\nattempt to attach themselves to any hairy object which may come near, much\r\nas burrs attach themselves to the wool of sheep.\r\n\r\nA certain number of them by merest chance, apparently, succeed in getting\r\nonto the bodies of the bees and are carried by them to their nests. As the\r\nmale bees, in this particular species, appear a month before the female,\r\nit seems probable, Fabre thinks, that the vast majority of triangulins\r\nattach themselves at first to the males and later, when a chance occurs,\r\ndiscovering their mistake, transfer themselves onto the females and so get\r\ncarried to the underground cells, and are present when the mother bee\r\nfills the cell with honey and then lays an egg which floats around on top.\r\n\r\nThere is something ghastly in the picture of the mother bee laying her\r\nsingle egg, with the blister beetle larva on her back waiting till the\r\nlast moment in order to slip unexpectedly from her body to the egg, on\r\nwhich it floats in the honey as on a raft. When the unsuspecting bee has\r\nclosed in her unborn child, the hideous monster which is perched on top of\r\nit eats it up. This takes eight days, and when it has eaten up its raft,\r\nthe triangulin moults and becomes, as it were, an aquatic creature with\r\nbreathing pores so placed that it can float on the honey, and with a\r\nstomach so changed that it can be nourished by it. In about eight more\r\ndays the honey is consumed and the final moult takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA HIPPOPOTAMUS AMONG THE INSECTS\r\n\r\n(_Prionus sp._)\r\n\r\nWhy beetles as large as elephants never came into existence on this\r\nplanet, or have they developed on some other of the countless worlds of\r\nspace, are questions too hard for us to answer.\r\n\r\nThis wonderfully protected creature with long horn-like antennæ and\r\nhippopotamus-like jaws is a relative of the largest of the beetles, those\r\nwhich live in the great forests along the Amazon or in the tropical\r\njungles of the Fijian Islands, and whose grubs are good to eat. Some years\r\nago, in a clearing in a New Zealand forest, a Maori dug out several\r\nhandfuls of the white wriggling creatures for me and a settler's wife\r\nfried them with butter over the fire in her kitchen stove, and I can\r\ntestify that they were as crisp and delicate as fried oysters.\r\n\r\nLike the other giant creatures of the forest, these Prionids, as they are\r\ncalled, are growing rarer with the destruction of the forest trees on\r\nwhich they live, and some day their skeletons in museum cases may be all\r\nthat remain of them.\r\n\r\nThese long-horned wood borers do not themselves bore into the wood; how\r\ncould they with their long antennæ? It is their other selves, their grubs,\r\nthat live deep in the solid heart wood of some oak or hickory tree. There\r\nis something strange in their solitary hermit-cell life. Think of living\r\nfor two years or more in a narrow hole which shuts you in on all sides and\r\nhaving for a steady diet the walls of your cell to feed upon. Prisoners\r\nhave burrowed under prison stockades to escape, but these larvæ\r\ndeliberately leave the outer, softer sapwood in which they hatch, and\r\nstart for the interior of the trunk, packing behind them with sawdust and\r\nexcrement the tunnel which they eat out.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the grubs of some species of these Prionids choose to live\r\nin the roots and trunks of trees which we choose to cultivate makes them\r\nour enemies, and every good orchardist knows that the only way to stop\r\nthem is to dig them out or stab them with a wire run through them in their\r\nburrows.\r\n\r\nThis fellow bit savagely at a pencil, and when he finally caught hold, I\r\nlifted him up as one does a bull dog, and he hung there almost as long.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE LONGICORN BEETLES\r\n\r\n(_Orthosoma brunneum_, Forst.)\r\n\r\nAt first glance this longhorn might pass for a Prionus, but its antennæ\r\nare very different and the shape of its broad collar or prothorax is not\r\nthe same. To a trained eye they could never be confused, which cannot be\r\nsaid of all beetles! In fact there is perhaps no group of living organisms\r\nwhich scientific men have more difficulty in classifying than the beetles,\r\nunless it be the lichens on the stones and trees. Their differences are so\r\nminute and their grub lives so obscure that they have sometimes to be bred\r\nin order to determine their relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN SCARAB\r\n\r\n(_Copris carolina_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nI cannot help wondering what one of the priests of ancient Egypt would\r\nthink of this picture of a New World relative of his sacred scarab. To me\r\nthere has always been something strangely beautiful in the veneration\r\nwhich the great Egyptian race has shown for thousands of years towards the\r\nhumble, industrious beetle which spends its life in the droppings from\r\nEgyptian cattle.\r\n\r\nGo to Gizeh, and look at the images of the scarab beetle carved from the\r\nrarest stories the lapidary could find, mounted in the loveliest gold\r\nsettings he could fashion, and reflect that the ladies of the court wore\r\nthese dung beetles around their necks and were buried with them on.\r\n\r\nWas this veneration of the scarab as old, almost, as the race, and did it\r\ncome with the race into its civilization, or did it arise as the whim of\r\nsome great Pharaoh?\r\n\r\nIt is said that somewhere with this veneration there was included a\r\nsymbolism. The living scarab is a tumble bug, the female makes a ball of\r\ndung much larger than herself and either with her shovel pointed nose, or\r\nelse standing on her head with her hind legs on the ball, she either\r\npushes or pulls the ball along until she finds some suitable place in\r\nwhich to dig a hole and bury this ball so that later she may consume it at\r\nher ease. It has been suggested that some Egyptian astronomer, watching\r\nthe rolling ball, may have suggested an analogy with the movement of the\r\nheavenly bodies--with the traveling of the moon around the earth. For we\r\nmust not forget that in those days the wonder of the heavens was fresh and\r\nnew and the idea of world-balls of matter was a subject of intense\r\nintellectual excitement.\r\n\r\nBut there was yet another reason for the veneration of the Egyptians. The\r\nfact that these beetles suddenly disappeared into the ground and that\r\nlater they appeared again was taken as proof of a future life.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we can take a lesson from the ancient Egyptians and\r\nsee in things as insignificant as the beetles of manure the greatness of\r\nthe world of change and really feel the wonder of it all.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity, but I have to admit that this American species is not a\r\n\"tumble bug,\" but contents herself with digging holes, filling them with\r\nmanure and laying her eggs on it, instead of rolling a well-made ball to\r\nsome special place as her Egyptian cousin does.\r\n\r\nThe mother scarab, unlike every other beetle, lives to see her children\r\ngrow up, indeed she produces two families of little scarabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE-SPOTTED CUCUMBER BEETLE\r\n\r\n(_Diabrotica duodecim punctata_, Oliv.)\r\n\r\nThere are few of our insect enemies which do their destructive work more\r\nrapidly than do the cucumber beetles. Every child in the South who has\r\nleft his cucumber hills unscreened knows this, for he has found them some\r\nmorning literally eaten up over night by the spotted or striped\r\nyellow-green cucumber beetles.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle is, where do they come from so suddenly? It is as though they\r\nwere waiting for cucumbers to come up, and this is pretty nearly true, for\r\nthe adults have wintered in the leaves and rubbish of the garden and are\r\nall ready to concentrate on the plantlets in the spring.\r\n\r\nUnlike so many pests, which are content to trouble us only during a part\r\nof their existence, this twelve-spotted cucumber beetle is our enemy all\r\nits life long, for it spends its larval life eating the roots of corn and\r\nother field crops.\r\n\r\nIt is a wide-spread pest, with many relatives quite as bad as it is, and\r\nnot only does it eat up the young and defenseless cucumbers and the roots\r\nof the corn, but it is the carrier of a germ infection of a serious nature\r\nto the cucumber. My friend, Dr. Erwin F. Smith, informs me that its kind\r\nhas infested large areas in the South with this disease and dashed the\r\nhopes of thousands of boys who, instead of feasting on the melons they\r\nhave planted with such care, must stand helplessly by and watch the leaves\r\nand flowers wilt and the vines decay. It must be remembered that this is a\r\nwinged carrier of disease and anyone who still fails to understand the\r\nspeed of travel of an epidemic had better watch the cucumber beetles busy\r\nspreading this destructive germ disease. A single beetle feeding on a\r\ndiseased leaf can carry on its jaws enough germs to infect every melon or\r\ncucumber plant in a neighboring field, and that, too, in a single day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE SAWYERS\r\n\r\n(_Monohammus titilator_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nWhile standing on a street corner waiting for a street-car one day last\r\nsummer my attention was attracted to this beautiful squirrel-gray creature\r\nat my feet. It was so evidently ill that, as I picked it up, I began to\r\nexamine it to find out what was the matter. Clustered on its neck, out of\r\nreach of its feet or jaws were whitish bodies which evidently did not\r\nbelong to its external skeleton but were probably the eggs of what I took\r\nto be some parasite whose growth within the body of the beast had brought\r\nabout its pitiable condition. These are just visible between the\r\ncreature's \"horns\" in the photograph. It was, in other words, a sick\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nIt is because biologists see these parasites so plainly all down through\r\nthe scale of living things that they are so sceptical of accepting any\r\nother cause of human disease until all possibility has been excluded of\r\nits being caused by some parasite or other, too small to be seen even by\r\nusing the best microscopes.\r\n\r\nMy sympathy for this long-horned beetle would be keener did I not read\r\nthat its larval self is spent inside the wood of the pines and firs of our\r\nforests, doing great damage to them.\r\n\r\nWhen one is puzzled to know why any living thing should be burdened by\r\nsuch antler-like antennæ, let him remember the peacock's tail and the bird\r\nof paradise's plumage and be content to know that the laws of evolution\r\nare not yet fully known, and that, given time and growth, almost any form\r\ncan be evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO-WINGED INSECTS\r\n\r\n(_Diptera_)\r\n\r\nYears ago in Berlin, my German landlady called me in as an expert to\r\ndecide a controversy between her children and herself as to whether a frog\r\nhad four legs or six. It seemed strange to me then that a grown-up woman\r\nshould not know the number of a frog's legs. Yet there will be many who\r\nread these pages who do not know how many wings a fly has. And flies are\r\nmuch more important than frogs.\r\n\r\nIn fact the mosquito and the house fly, both included in the order of the\r\nflies, probably cause more deaths and are more dangerous to human life\r\nthan any other creatures in the world.\r\n\r\nThese portraits are of a few only of the vast myriads of forms of\r\ntwo-winged insects which haunt the world. Were I to photograph just one\r\nindividual of each different species which inhabit the globe, I would have\r\nto spend a lifetime doing it, and when it was finished it would make five\r\nhundred volumes about the size of this one.\r\n\r\nThere should never be the slightest difficulty in telling a fly from other\r\ninsects for there are no other two-winged forms.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flies are sucking insects, their beaks lap up liquid food and\r\nare not at all like the beaks of the bugs. In the great majority of flies,\r\nthe beaks resemble a trunk with curious fleshy folds or lips. It is true\r\nsome species, like the mosquito, have long, sharp-pointed stylets which,\r\nworking up and down, puncture the skin of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe larval forms of many flies are maggots, those squirming, often almost\r\nheadless creatures that abound in rotting carcasses or decaying matter of\r\nall kinds, and this is one of the reasons why less is known about the\r\nflies than about some others of the insect world which have selected less\r\nrevolting birthplaces.\r\n\r\nOf course, in such a gigantic family no general rules apply, and still, a\r\nmaggot, whether in an orange or a dead horse, is most likely to be the\r\nlarva of a diptera or two-winged insect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CRANE FLY\r\n\r\n(_Limnobia sp._)\r\n\r\nEvery lover of the autumn woods must have noticed on some still October\r\nday, in the little clearings in the woods, these awkward, long-legged\r\nflies which, frightened by the approach of a human being, gather their\r\nungainly hind legs together behind and their forelegs in front of them and\r\nslowly and laboriously flutter upward into the sunlight. They are\r\nwell-named, these creatures, \"the crane flies,\" for their legs are as long\r\nand apparently much more useless than those of the crane. In fact some\r\nentomologists have expressed themselves as wondering why they have such\r\nlegs at all for they are so fragile that they break at the slightest\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nThey belong to a family with a thousand species in it and perhaps the most\r\npeculiar thing about them is that some forms of the family live and fly\r\nabout when there is snow on the ground. This is a very rare exception in\r\nthe insect world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN INSECT HAWK: ONE OF THE ROBBER FLIES\r\n\r\n(_Erax æstuans_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nHer strong, spiny legs, her powerful body filled with strong wing muscles,\r\nand her sharp beak, make this robber fly one of the most dreaded enemies\r\nof the other winged insects for, like the hawk among the birds, she\r\npounces on them in their flight and tears them to pieces with her beak,\r\nsucking the blood from them as she carries them in the air. A single one\r\nof these insect hawks, or robber flies, as they are called, has been known\r\nto catch and devour as many as eight moths in twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nThese robber flies are fearless creatures, for they attack and kill bumble\r\nbees and wasps and even, it is said, that monster demon, the dragon-fly.\r\nTiger beetles, too, are said to fall a prey to this insect hawk.\r\n\r\nIts other or larval self is also predaceous, boring into beetle larvæ in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA ROBBER FLY\r\n\r\n(_Dasyllis grossa_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nWhen I learned that this powerfully winged, hairy fly tears beetles' wings\r\nfrom off their backs with that wedge-shaped beak of hers, and sucks the\r\nblood of bees and wasps, it gave me a different idea of the great fly\r\nfamily, which hitherto I had thought was made up of defenseless creatures\r\nlike the house fly.\r\n\r\nOf all the insects we have photographed, few have seemed to be more\r\nthoroughly fearless or more ugly than the robber flies. I have never seen\r\none capture and devour a creature larger than itself, but it must be as\r\nthrilling an adventure as to see a dragon-fly devour a gnat, or a spider\r\npounce upon the prey entangled in its net.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nANOTHER VIEW OF THE ROBBER FLY\r\n\r\n(_Dasyllis grossa_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nAt first it looked as though this creature had two heads, one at each end\r\nof its body, but the great facet eyes, of which only one can be seen in\r\nthe photograph, make it clear which is the head and which the egg-laying\r\nend of this strange, fearless robber of the air.\r\n\r\nJust why it is called a robber fly when it really doesn't rob at all, but\r\nkills, is a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE LARGE ROBBER FLIES\r\n\r\n(_Mallophora sp._)\r\n\r\nThis robber fly is not so quick nor so savage as many of its family. It\r\nwaits for some slow moving insect to come along then pounces upon it.\r\n\r\nIt probably breeds in decaying wood, although this is not certainly known,\r\nand it is very difficult to breed them artificially.\r\n\r\nTo the economic entomologist the ability to breed these monsters in\r\ncaptivity is one of the most important factors in studying out their life\r\nhistories, as they are called, their various stages, the plants they feed\r\non, their habits of moulting, of breeding and of feeding their young.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE WORST OF THE ROBBER FLIES\r\n\r\n(_Deromyia_)\r\n\r\nThis creature is very savage and pounces upon even large sized insects,\r\nparalyzing them instantly by a sting of its poisoned beak.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CULEX MOSQUITO\r\n\r\n(_Culex sp._)\r\n\r\nThe flat white wings of this long-legged creature, vibrating rapidly in\r\nthe air, make what everyone will agree is the most annoying sound in the\r\nworld. They make the mosquitos' hum. The cigar-shaped abdomen is striped\r\nlike a convict's jacket. As a boy there was to me a peculiar fascination\r\nin watching that abdomen pinken and turn red along its sides as it filled\r\nwith blood sucked from my hand.\r\n\r\nThe large eyes compose almost the entire head of a mosquito and in some\r\nspecies they are of an emerald green hue. Straight out in front, close\r\ntogether, curved downward at the tip, are two antennæ furnished with\r\ndelicate hairs arranged like a bottle brush. With these the creature hears\r\nthe love hum of its mate and probably scents also the neighborhood of any\r\nwarm-blooded animal.\r\n\r\nWere this a male, instead of a female, these hairs would be much longer\r\nand there would be many more of them--they are the smelling organs of the\r\ncreature and the hearing organs, too, being set into vibration by sound\r\nwaves of a certain rate. It is important to remember this, for only the\r\nfemales are bloodthirsty. The long, slender proboscis projecting from the\r\nhead, downward, is furnished with sharp, piercing stylets which, by\r\nworking up and down, cut their way through the skin. Ordinarily the males\r\nand females both are content with sap of plants and fruits as their food,\r\nand blood does not seem to be a necessary part of their diet. It is\r\ncurious that what is supposed to be merely an acquired habit of the female\r\nonly, of an insignificant little fly, should mean so much to mankind.\r\n\r\nJust why a mosquito bite is poisonous is still a matter of question--the\r\nsuggestion has been made that since both male and female really live on\r\nplants, the fluid which the female injects is for the purpose of\r\npreventing the plant juice from coagulating during the process of sucking\r\nand merely happens to be irritating to warm-blooded animals.\r\n\r\nThere are three hundred different species of these creatures already\r\ndescribed and fortunately this one, a species of culex, is not\r\nresponsible, so far as known, for the carrying of any human disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE HARMLESS ANOPHELES MOSQUITOS\r\n\r\n(_Anopheles punctipennis_, Say)\r\n\r\nThe malarial mosquito, so called, has spotted wings, but otherwise it\r\nlooks quite like this harmless form from Maryland. This whole tribe of\r\nAnopheles differs from the Culex in the length of its mouth feelers, which\r\nproject from the base of the proboscis and appear in the photograph almost\r\nas long as the proboscis itself, whereas in a photograph of the Culex it\r\nwould appear so short as to seem merely a thickening of the base of the\r\nproboscis.\r\n\r\nThe wildest fancy of the Arabian story-teller is lacking in imagination\r\ncompared with the story which the facts of modern science have woven about\r\nthese tiny representatives of the fly family.\r\n\r\nWho could imagine that just because the lady mosquitos, tiring of their\r\nusual meal of ripe bananas and plant juices, acquired the habit of sucking\r\nblood, vast regions would be devastated and beings millions of times their\r\nsize would die by thousands. And this, too, not through any real fault of\r\nthe tiny creatures themselves, but just because some of the persons whose\r\nblood they sucked had microscopic wiggling things living in their blood\r\ncorpuscles, which crawled into the soft throat glands of the mosquito and\r\nwaited there for a chance to get out into the blood channels of some other\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nWhen one pictures the grief of desolated homes, death-bed agonies of\r\ntossing fever patients, the quarantined vessels at anchor in tropical\r\nharbors, yellow flagged, with crews dead or dying, the streets of deserted\r\nhouses from which all life has gone forever through yellow fever and\r\nmalaria, there is something ghastly in the picture of the winged lady\r\nmosquitos flitting airily from pale-faced patients to ruddy-cheeked happy\r\npeople, unwitting carriers of death.\r\n\r\nNo conquest of science seems more wonderful in its simplicity and more\r\nremarkable in its importance than the discovery that the glands at the\r\nbase of the mosquito's bill can become diseased and harbor a microscopic\r\nparasite, and transform this merely buzzing, annoying insect into one of\r\nthe most dangerous creatures alive. To Dr. L. O. Howard, the pioneer of\r\neconomic entomology, is due the great credit for first showing how this\r\ncreature can be killed by the use of kerosene on the stagnant waters where\r\nthe females lay their eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE BEE FLIES\r\n\r\n(_Sparnopolius fulvus_, Wied.)\r\n\r\nNo butterfly or any other creature of the air could be more beautiful than\r\nthis dream of early summer. The black velvet body, into which the sunlight\r\nsank and disappeared, the fringe of golden hairs along its sides, the\r\nsteel gray, myriad-facet eyes of which its head was made, and the\r\ndelicately formed wings, so thin that the light in passing through them\r\nwas refracted into rainbow tints, made it seem to me more beautiful than\r\nalmost any of those gorgeous forms of insect life which sometimes fill the\r\nclearings in Brazilian forests.\r\n\r\nIt does seem strange that such a thing as this should live its other life\r\na parasitic grub within the larva of some caterpillar, or in the egg-case\r\nof some grasshopper; but so it seems to do. It spends its childhood as a\r\ndisease, and its mating days as a dainty fly among the nectar-bearing\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nANOTHER OF THE BEE FLIES\r\n\r\n(_Spogostylum simson_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nWhere you see the carpenter bee you always see these bee flies waiting for\r\nthe bee to go away from home. When the mother bee is out the female fly\r\ngoes into the cell of the bee and lays her egg, and when her larva hatches\r\nout it eats up the bee's larva.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLARGE SYRPHID FLY\r\n\r\n(_Melesia virginiensis_, Dru.)\r\n\r\nThis is a very bright-colored syrphid fly often seen soaring in shadowy\r\nplaces, but what he is doing we do not know. He stays poised in the air\r\nand is one of the most beautiful flies we have.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of some of the smaller syrphid flies feed upon the larvæ of\r\nother insects, aphids in particular; but the larva of this one has never\r\nbeen seen, at least it has never been recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNOT A HOUSE FLY\r\n\r\n(_Archytas aterrima_, Des.)\r\n\r\nThis portrait of one of the many species of fly, not a house fly, however,\r\nis as different as it is possible to be from the maggot from which it\r\ngrew. The eggs of the mother fly, deposited in some decaying animal\r\nmatter, hatch in a few days, and out of these eggs come maggots with\r\nrudimentary legs and looking like beasts from another world entirely. In a\r\nfew days more they reach the limit of their growth, and stop, the tissues\r\nbreak down to a mush and out of this mush-like substance are formed flies\r\nwith wings and sucking, trunklike mouths just like their mothers. The\r\nmaggots have no sexual organs, and yet, out of the creamy mass of cells,\r\nthe sexual organs of the flies are formed as though directed by a force as\r\ncertain in its effects as the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nWe have been so intent on killing the fly and so afraid of it as the great\r\ncarrier of human diseases that we have lost sight of one phase of its\r\ncharacter, so to speak. Think of having under our eyes animals like these\r\ndipteras from which you can breed a new generation in twelve days! And\r\nwould it not be strange if, from studying the fly, we should learn the\r\nmeaning of heredity and sexuality, for this is one of the places where the\r\nscientists of the day are at work on the problem of inheritance, that\r\nproblem which, when elucidated, is likely to make more changes in the\r\nworld of humankind than almost anything which has so far been discovered.\r\nThe bearing of the fly on the welfare of the world is one of the most\r\nspectacular developments of modern times and a tribute to the value of\r\nknowing the minutest details of the world in which we live.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE FLY\r\n\r\n(_Tabanus atratus_, Forst.)\r\n\r\nThe head of the horse fly appears to be all eyes, and it is no wonder that\r\nwe can so seldom take it by surprise.\r\n\r\nBelow the oblong, compound eyes are the sharp mouthparts, which in the\r\nfemale are provided with lancets, which enable her to puncture the skin of\r\nwarm-blooded animals and suck their blood. It is curious that the female\r\nshould have such habits, while the males are content to lap up nectar from\r\nthe flowers.\r\n\r\nThis jet black, loud-buzzing creature flew into my laboratory and made so\r\nmuch noise that I was forced to kill her. This photograph of her is nine\r\ntimes her real diameter.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to a large and important family of flies, whose females make\r\nthe lives of men and animals miserable in many parts of the world by their\r\nbites, which form most annoying wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA GREEN-HEADED HORSE FLY\r\n\r\n(_Tabanus punctifer_, O. S.)\r\n\r\nThere are nearly two hundred species of horse flies in North America, and\r\nthis creature represents one of the commonest forms. It doubtless hatched\r\nout somewhere on the edge of the brook which flows through my place in\r\nMaryland, and its larval self fed upon other insect larvæ or on the snails\r\nand slugs it found itself among.\r\n\r\nThe bands of iridescent green and copper and purple across its enormous\r\neyes made it a beautiful creature to look upon.\r\n\r\nWe never used to think the bite of flies was anything worse than annoying,\r\nbut recently, since we have discovered the danger of letting the germs of\r\ndisease into the blood streams of our bodies, we have come to see the\r\nghastly possibilities which lie in the piercing mouthparts of these flies.\r\nThey suck the blood of animals whose blood streams may be swarming with\r\ndisease germs, and then fly directly to our houses and puncture our skins\r\nwith a beak covered with these germs which slip off into our veins.\r\n\r\nUntil we know that the diseases of the birds, and field mice, the coons\r\nand 'possums, and all other warm-blooded beasts of a locality are harmless\r\nto us, or that it is impossible to transmit them to human beings, it is\r\nbest to look upon these blood-sucking creatures as winged hypodermic\r\nsyringes laden with disease.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the horse flies carry anthrax, and their bites\r\nsometimes cause malignant pustules. They are also under suspicion as\r\ncarriers of infantile paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATHERED INSECTS\r\n\r\n(_Lepidoptera_)\r\n\r\nThese are peculiarly the feathered fliers of the insect world, for their\r\nwings and their bodies, too, are covered with most remarkable one-celled\r\nfeathers or scales of gorgeous colors which make of some of them the most\r\nbrilliant of all living things.\r\n\r\nJust what these scales are for is not entirely clear, and will not be,\r\nperhaps, until we understand the purpose of the gorgeous coloring itself.\r\nThere is a theory that these scales help to grip the air in flying.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that one of these gorgeously colored creatures\r\nshould furnish mankind with the material for his own most gaily colored\r\nraiment. The silkworm is one of the very few domesticated insects, so to\r\nspeak, of all the hundreds of thousands of insect species in existence,\r\nand a hundred millions of dollars is paid every year for the delicate silk\r\nthreads unraveled from countless millions of cocoons which the silkworm\r\nlarvæ have laboriously fashioned around themselves.\r\n\r\nTo many people, moths are known by what they leave behind--holes in the\r\nwinter woolens; and butterflies are to them, somehow, things of the\r\nsunlight and the summertime. It is worth while to know that these great\r\nfamilies of butterflies and moths are not by any means divided equally,\r\nthat for every family of butterflies there are at least nine of the moths\r\nand that the butterflies form but a small proportion of the gaily colored\r\ninsects of the fields.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it makes but little difference to the public, who call them all\r\nalike, but it is as easy to tell a butterfly from a moth as it is to tell\r\na lizard from a snake, for all the butterflies have club-shaped feelers,\r\nor antennæ, whereas the moths do not, and any child of six can learn to\r\ntell the two apart.\r\n\r\nNo butterfly or moth in its winged state can harm us or our plants. It has\r\nno jaws, but keeps itself alive by sucking nectar from the flowers or\r\njuices from the fruits or other parts. Its other self, its larva, however,\r\ncan cause no end of damage. One inconspicuous, brownish form, the\r\ncodling-moth, no larger than my thumb nail, costs apple growers about ten\r\nmillion dollars every year, while the cabbage moth, the clothes moth, the\r\ncutworm and the dreaded gipsy-moth are only a few examples of a gigantic\r\narmy of voracious larvæ against which man has been struggling ever since\r\nhe first began to plant seeds in the ground or set out trees for fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLARVA OF THE SWALLOW-TAIL BUTTERFLY OF THE SPICE-BUSH\r\n\r\n(_Papilio troilus_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nIs this, I wonder, an insect make-believe, a caterpillar mask, as it were,\r\nto frighten away enemies? The black and white eye-spots are not real eyes,\r\nbut to a bird they doubtless seem so. Its real eyes are inconspicuous\r\npoints at each side of the head, too small to appear in the photograph.\r\n\r\nFew of as stop to think, as the beautiful swallow-tail butterfly, gorgeous\r\nin its black and yellow painted wings, flits by us, that it is made of\r\nsassafras and spice-bush leaves gathered together and ground up. This\r\nmonster is a leaf-eating creature, its purpose being the accumulation of\r\nfood material out of which is made inside of it the gorgeous swallow-tail\r\nbutterfly. It feeds on sassafras and spice-bush leaves, and when the time\r\narrives makes a nest for itself by fastening the edges of a leaf together.\r\nIn this nest it passes the winter. When spring comes it breaks open the\r\ngray shell of the chrysalis, unfolds a pair of black and gold wings with\r\nlong tails to them, and flies away in the sunshine in search of flowers\r\nand a mate. It is then no more like this monster than an eagle is like a\r\nhippopotamus, yet after it has flown about, sucking nectar through its\r\nlong beak, it mates and lays a mass of eggs, out of which hatch again\r\nthese strange, weird beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFORE PART OF A BROWN BUTTERFLY\r\n\r\n(_Agrynnis cybele_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nIt is hard to realize that this is the portrait of the head and fore part\r\nof a beautiful brown butterfly.\r\n\r\nIts head is almost all taken up with the gigantic eyes, which are composed\r\nof thousands of tiny facets. The long, trunklike mouth with which it sucks\r\nthe nectar from the flowers is coiled up like a watch spring. Like\r\nshingles on a roof, the scales are fastened in tiers over the broad\r\nsurface of the wings stretched over the stiff ribs or framework.\r\n\r\nThe white spots are made by hundreds of white scales and the brown\r\nblotches by brown scales, and what these scales are for nobody seems to\r\nknow. Perhaps they help to grip the wind, for they have running lengthwise\r\nof them deep and parallel corrugations so small and fine that were a\r\nsingle scale as large as a lady's opened fan these corrugations would\r\nrepresent its sticks.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar from which this splendid creature came is black, with\r\nbranching spines, and feeds at night on violets and other plants.\r\n\r\nThe graceful beauty of the butterfly, its seemingly happy existence, its\r\nlife among the flowers, where it sips the nectar that the flowers provide,\r\nare all a part of common knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe real life of the butterfly, however, is not so pleasant as we think.\r\nHave you ever found a butterfly hanging beneath a leaf on a cold summer\r\nmorning drenched with dew and stiff with cold? Have you ever seen one\r\ntrying to cross a field in a rain-storm and observed it vainly attempting\r\nto navigate the conflicting air currents? Where do they roost at night and\r\non rainy days? Where do they come from and what becomes of them? These are\r\nmatters which it has often taken men years to find out, and even now there\r\nare many thousands of species of butterflies which are known only by a\r\npreserved specimen caught in its flight by the net of some collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYELLOW BUTTERFLY\r\n\r\n(_Colias philodice_, Gdt.)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is so complete between the butterfly which\r\nflits over the cabbage patch and the velvety green worm that eats holes in\r\nthe leaves of the cabbages that it is no wonder that for centuries no\r\nconnection between the two careers of these creatures, seemingly so far\r\napart, was suspected. In general it is true that no moth or butterfly is\r\ninjurious to plants except in its larval stage, and herein has lain the\r\nclever deception which has doubtless protected these gay mating creatures\r\nof the air from the systematic attacks of man until quite recent times.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows what every boy and girl should know, that every\r\nbutterfly has club-shaped feelers or antennæ.\r\n\r\nIt is said of certain species of yellow butterflies that the males give\r\noff a pleasing, aromatic odor which is exhaled from the front wings\r\nthrough hundreds of minute, slender scales--scales quite different from\r\nthose with which the wings and body are covered. This scent, which is so\r\nstrong that it can be detected by even our blunted olfactory organs if we\r\nrub the wings between thumb and forefinger, is supposed to attract the\r\nfemales in some way that is little understood. As among these particular\r\nbutterflies the male seeks out its mate, it is difficult to understand why\r\nit should be the male which has the perfume, since it does not serve to\r\ntell the female where her mate is to be found. The inference is that in\r\nsome way the perfume charms the female.\r\n\r\nIn some species it is the females which give off an odor, and in either\r\ncase the distances over which these odors extend and are detected by the\r\nmales or females respectively are analogous to the inconceivable reach of\r\nwireless telegraphy. And who knows but the mechanism of these creatures is\r\nset to respond to the swiftly traveling ions which make wireless\r\ntelegraphy possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA BABY OF THE SKIPPER BUTTERFLY\r\n\r\n(_Eudamus tityrus_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nThere is something fascinatingly strange to me in the babies of the winged\r\nbutterflies, and I wonder why so many people have an aversion for them?\r\nCan there be an instinctive fear of anything that crawls, or is not this\r\nfear taught us by unthinking persons? The child is not afraid of the\r\nwide-mouthed naked little birds in the nest, or the little blind pink\r\nmice, and certainly they are no more innocent looking than the brilliant\r\ncolored larva of the butterflies or moths.\r\n\r\nWhat helpless things these babies are! They cannot fly, they cannot fight,\r\nthey can barely see, and even their gait is a hobbled one.\r\n\r\nTheir business is to eat, and their jaws must keep busy pretty constantly\r\nto fill their stomachs with leaf fragments, for the greater part of the\r\nsoft, flabby bodies is stomach. They are males and females but which they\r\nare you cannot tell until they turn into butterflies.\r\n\r\nAlong this creature's sides, like portholes in an ocean liner, are the\r\nbreathing pores, nine in number. Most animals which live on land take air\r\nin through a single opening into a great cavity through which the blood\r\ncirculates and is purified, but the caterpillars, and all insects in fact,\r\ninstead of circulating their blood in and out of a pair of lungs, have,\r\nrunning through their bodies, a labyrinth of air passages, all connected\r\nwith the outside air by means of breathing pores.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar's eyes are poor affairs, and unless you look closely you\r\nwill not find them, for they are merely a few raised spots, like blisters,\r\nbeneath the skin on either side of its jaws.\r\n\r\nIt has, like the spiders, a spinneret and a reservoir of liquid silk with\r\nwhich, as it outgrows its baby state, it can spin its own arbor of tough\r\nsilk fibers and hide itself from view while it is changing to a butterfly.\r\nIf in late summer you will put one of these creatures in a tumbler and\r\nwatch it for a day or two, you can see it plainly through the glass\r\npouring out the liquid silk in a steady stream, waving its head from side\r\nto side. The silk comes from a spinneret which is just behind the jaws and\r\nis about the color of thin starch paste. The way it loops back upon itself\r\nand flows in curves reminds me most forcibly of the way the pastry cook,\r\nwith frosting in a paper cornucopia, writes one's name upon a birthday\r\ncake.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA BUTTERFLY'S MUMMY CASE\r\n\r\nOne of the most marvelously beautiful of all living creatures lies waiting\r\nwithin this case for the resurrection day, when growth shall split open\r\nthis polished casket and it shall feel the wings, close packed for weeks,\r\nunfold, and, stretching to a hundred times their size, bear it away into\r\nthe sunshine.\r\n\r\nDid the Pharaohs, I wonder, or their wise men, seeing this, model their\r\nmummy cases after those which the butterflies make?\r\n\r\nThis is the chrysalis of a butterfly, that wonder of poets since poetry\r\nbegan, that life-stage of the butterfly which our faith and hopes make\r\ncomparable to our own rest in the tomb from which man in all ages has\r\nbelieved there came a resurrection and another life, no more to be\r\ncompared with this than the butterfly's own existence among the flowers is\r\nto be likened to his crawling one upon the leaves. And because the minds\r\nof many men in seeking to understand, have broken down this beautiful\r\nanalogy by finding that there is no real decay within the chrysalis, we\r\nmust not hence conclude they have done more than brush away a fancied\r\nsimilarity. The mystery remains.\r\n\r\nIf you should open this butterfly mummy case, lay bare the mummy as it\r\nwere, you would find a pair of wings in process of formation, a head, a\r\ncurled-up sucking beak, legs and embryo antennæ, that is, providing it\r\nwere near the resurrection time. If not, and you had broken in too early,\r\nthe greater part within the case would be a semi-fluid mass of broken down\r\ncell tissues from which the legs and wings and all the other parts are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe portholes along the side lead deep into the body and are probably as\r\nnecessary to the growing butterfly inside as they are to it when it once\r\nemerges. The chrysalis must breathe.\r\n\r\nTo many people there is much confusion as to what is a chrysalis and what\r\na real cocoon. Every cocoon is a silken case spun by the caterpillar in\r\nwhich it can securely hide while it changes first into the chrysalis and\r\nthen into its winged and final form. This chrysalis, or pupa, forms within\r\nthe body skin and some caterpillars do not spin a cocoon at all, but\r\nmerely rest somewhere away from view, until this strange process has been\r\ncompleted within the out-worn shell. This photograph is of such a\r\nchrysalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA MOTH\r\n\r\nWe commonly picture the moths and butterflies with their wings spread out\r\nor else upright in the air, but many moths trail their wings when they\r\nalight and escape our notice by their quiet colors. Walk through the grass\r\nand you will frighten thousands which, when they alight again, you cannot\r\nfor the life of you detect upon the grass stems.\r\n\r\nThere are hardly any butterflies that trail their wings like this and not\r\none of them has beautiful feathery antennæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNOT GOOD TO EAT\r\n\r\nHave you never wondered at the temerity with which certain of these\r\nslow-moving, helpless creatures expose themselves to the attacks of their\r\nenemies? In a world so full of hungry, winged beings it does seem strange,\r\nand when the markings are black and white or some such striking color in\r\ncontrast with the leaves or bark the temerity seems even more\r\nextraordinary, until one learns the simple fact--these creatures are not\r\nvery good to eat.\r\n\r\nNot good enough to eat! Supposing that the fly and the mosquito were\r\nequipped with some flavor distasteful to the insectivorous birds; if\r\ncattle were not good to eat, nor sheep, nor hogs, nor any living,\r\nbreathing things, what a change there would be in a world like ours! And\r\nyet to chemists there is very little difference between some compounds\r\nthat are good to eat and others that are deadly poison, no greater than\r\nthat between the poison bitter almond and the sweet one of our dinner\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help but wonder why it is that when the border-land twixt food\r\nand poison is so narrow in the chemistry of the living cell that every\r\ncreature has not equipped itself with prussic acid enough to preserve\r\nitself from its enemies.\r\n\r\nWhile this protection holds good against many predaceous creatures, there\r\nare various birds and even snakes that have found this particular\r\ncaterpillar not too bad to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA HAIRY SPECTACLE\r\n\r\n(_Euchætes egle_, Dru.)\r\n\r\nMany of the caterpillars of our fields are striking in their form and\r\ncolor. This one could easily be seen some distance off and might to birds\r\nand others of its enemies be what the skunk is to its enemy the dog--a\r\nthing to shun.\r\n\r\nIn the luxuriance of its \"plumage\" it, in some respects, reminds one of\r\nthose fantastic forms of fowls produced by close line breeding, the\r\nHudans, for example, or the long-tailed roosters of Japan.\r\n\r\nFew creatures that we have photographed have been more beautiful than this\r\nblack and white larva with its hairs in graceful tufts all over its body.\r\nWhat it eats or what its other self is like, I have not yet been able to\r\nfind out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN UNKNOWN CATERPILLAR\r\n\r\nCreatures like this, when they come walking down a garden path, are so\r\nstriking and so gracefully weird that one would think their forms\r\ndeserving of more study than they get. There is a reason for this, though,\r\nthat is not hard to find; they are such transient creatures. A few days in\r\nthe egg, a week or two as caterpillars, and they pass into their cocoons\r\nto emerge as moths or butterflies, and of the two weeks when they are\r\ncaterpillars, the first part of the time they are too small to make much\r\nimpression upon us.\r\n\r\nThen too, you cannot collect and keep them as you can the butterflies or\r\nbeetles, in fact this strange horned beast is still unnamed because its\r\ncarcass shriveled and faded until it bore so little resemblance to its\r\nliving self that it could not be identified. It is quite unlike the\r\nhickory borer or horned devil, being dark red-brown in color. It takes a\r\nskilled taxidermist entomologist to squeeze them out, blow up the skin and\r\nmount them in a case, and that is the only way to keep these forms, unless\r\nwe have found another way in these photographs of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA CATERPILLAR DEVOURED BY A FUNGUS\r\n\r\n(_Apantesis nais attacked by Empusa sp._, Dru.)\r\n\r\nOne cold morning in early autumn I saw this caterpillar lying so still on\r\nthe grass stem on which you see it that I thought I could photograph it\r\nbefore it woke up. I picked the grass panicle, but when I came to look\r\nclosely at the caterpillar I found it was a shriveled corpse and that\r\nthere were gaping wounds in its sides, filled with the threads of a\r\nparasitic fungus; a fungus familiar to me through one of its distant\r\nrelatives which I spent six months of my life studying, and which lives in\r\nthe intestines of the frog. There is something ghastly about the slow but\r\nresistless working of a fungus in the body of a caterpillar. One cannot\r\nhelp wondering where the plant got in and how the caterpillar felt about\r\nit. Was there the horror of finding that it could not be dislodged and the\r\nhopelessness of the struggle against it and the impending death and\r\nshortening of an already very brief existence?\r\n\r\nSo these, and seemingly all other creatures, have their diseases, and the\r\nstudies which men have made and are making upon them in all parts of the\r\nworld are helping us to understand the causes of those which attack and\r\noften conquer human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVE-WINGED INSECTS\r\n\r\n(_Neuroptera_)\r\n\r\nThere was a time before all living things were classified, when there were\r\nno groups of plants or animals or insects. It is something to be proud of\r\nthat man has grouped the likes together and formed, out of the chaos of\r\nliving species, a system into which most of them can go like letters into\r\npigeonholes. Is it any wonder that with half a million species in this\r\ninsect world there should be some groups in which the species forming them\r\nseem to have very little likeness to each other? The nerve-winged insects\r\nseem to form just such a group, for the principal things they have in\r\ncommon seem to be peculiar nerve-veined wings and blood-thirsty habits.\r\n\r\nIf we could be quite sure that dragon-flies and scorpion-flies and\r\ncaddis-flies preyed only upon our foes, we could say with more confidence\r\nthan we do now, that they are our friends and not our enemies, and that\r\nmen should find some means by which to help increase the number of them in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that, as we learn more about them, they may take a much\r\nmore important place in public esteem, just as insectivorous birds are\r\ndoing. Perhaps they will come to be protected and their breeding places\r\nguarded by the drainage engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE DRAGON-FLY\r\n\r\nNo dragon of legend could be more blood-thirsty or terrible than this.\r\nWith four wings like the supporting planes of an aerodrome, it can fly as\r\nfast as a railway train. With thousands of eyes crowded together like\r\ncells in a honeycomb, forming eye masses that cover most of its head, it\r\ncan see in all directions at once. With massive jaws and teeth as sharp as\r\nneedle points, it can pierce and crush the strongest shell of its prey.\r\nWith its long-jointed spiny legs held out in front like a basket, it\r\nrushes through the air, catches and devours its prey and lets the carcass\r\nfall to the ground, all without slackening its terrible speed.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to realize, as you watch this swiftly moving dragon of the air,\r\nthat it has spent the first stage of its life as a slowly crawling, ugly\r\nwater monster lying in wait among the reeds and grasses for some\r\nunsuspecting water bug or larva to pass by.\r\n\r\nThe female, as she skims the surface of some pool, drops into the water\r\nher clumps of dragon eggs, a thousand at a time, and from these are born\r\nthe ugly water dragons, which, when come of age, grow wings and, crawling\r\nto the surface, split their old skins open, unfold and dry their closely\r\npacked wings, and dart away into the sunshine to prey upon the other\r\ncreatures of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE DRAGON-FLY AND ITS VICTIM\r\n\r\n(_Macromia sp._)\r\n\r\nWho would suspect, as one of these dragon-flies darts by him on the\r\nroadway, that every few minutes its jaws are crunching some helpless\r\ninsect caught in its flight?\r\n\r\nWhen I caught the dragon-fly whose picture is shown here, I held him by\r\nthe wings, and, catching a fly that buzzed about the table, dropped it in\r\nhis claws. Without a moment's hesitation his mouth opened wide and closed\r\nupon the fly. I watched it disappear underneath his great upper lip and\r\nalmost fancied I could hear its shell crack as the powerful jaws and lower\r\nlips turned it around and around in the mouth. A few seconds only, and the\r\nsucking throat had drawn out all the blood and the lips threw out a\r\nball-like mass made up of the fly's wings, legs and crushed body skeleton.\r\nThen it opened again for more.\r\n\r\nOne entomologist has said that in two hours a dragon-fly will eat at least\r\nforty house flies, and Doctor Howard says that if starved for food it will\r\neat up its own body.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these dragons of the air are to be counted as among our greatest\r\nfriends, and in places in the East where life is made a burden by that\r\nhumming, stinging pest, the mosquito, its presence in great numbers helps\r\namazingly in keeping down the day-flying forms of that insect. It has gone\r\ninto the Hawaiian Islands with the mosquito and has learned there to breed\r\nin the water found on the leaves of lilies growing on dry land.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone will find a way to domesticate this creature and make it\r\nlive upon the house flies around the house. As a first step, Needham has\r\nfed the larvæ on bits of meat.\r\n\r\nSharpe, the British authority, has observed a dragon-fly returning again\r\nand again to the same bush, and Westwood believes he saw the same\r\nindividual hawking for several weeks together over the same small pond.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDRAGON-FLY NYMPH MASKED\r\n\r\n(_Libellulid_)\r\n\r\nAs Kellogg says, it must, indeed, be worth more than a week of study in\r\nthe house to see just once the transformation of one of these mud dragons\r\nfrom the bottom of a pond into a beautiful dragon of the air,--a\r\ndragon-fly.\r\n\r\nOf all the strange, weird monsters with which I have ever had to deal,\r\nthis water one seems somehow weirdest. It reminds me of those\r\nsandy-colored, deep-sea fishes which, snuggling under the sand of the sea\r\nbottom, wait for their prey to come along and then dart out and seize them\r\nwith their powerful jaws.\r\n\r\nThe mud dragon has a mask which, for the purpose, is certainly the most\r\neffective thing one can imagine. Its victims must be greatly surprised to\r\nsee the mask drop, revealing a sheep-like nose, mouth, and lips, while the\r\nmask itself opening out and splitting down the middle, becomes a pair of\r\nneedle-margined, powerful claws so strong that even fishes are sometimes\r\ncaught and held by them.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to think of this dragon concealing its claws by making a\r\nshield of them to cover its ugly face while it waits in ambush for its\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nIts eyes and body are the color of mud and must be very hard to see.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows the mask in place, the grinning mouth a long curved\r\nslit across the face, while resting on the ground, as one would rest one's\r\nelbow on the table, is the powerful claw arm, so strong that you would\r\nfind it difficult to pull the mask away, or having done so to keep it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDRAGON-FLY NYMPH UNMASKED\r\n\r\n(_Libellulid_)\r\n\r\nPulled down from the mud dragon's sheep-nosed face, the mask is resting on\r\nthe ground. It can be stretched out much further and also opened up to\r\nform a pair of powerful claws. Along the edge of the mask is a fringe of\r\ninward-pointing spines like those which edge the leaf margins of a venus\r\nflytrap. The eyes are large and many-faceted and form the blunt-pointed\r\ncorners of its head.\r\n\r\nThe under-water battles in which these mud dragons, or dragon-fly nymphs,\r\ntake part must be something terrible. It is recorded that in Hungary\r\n50,000 young fishes were put into a pond in which enormous numbers of\r\nthese nymphs occurred and only fifty-four fishes survived. One is not\r\nsurprised to learn, too, that they will eat each other up.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it is doubtful if between the flies and other\r\ninjurious insects which the dragon-flies destroy in the air, and those\r\nlarvæ of mosquitos which the water nymphs destroy in the ponds, there is\r\nany other family of insects toward which man should feel more indebted\r\nthan toward the family of the odontata or dragon-flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN ABANDONED DRAGON CASE\r\n\r\n(_Libellulid_)\r\n\r\nFrom this muddy outworn shell, left to decay at the bottom of a pool,\r\nthere came, sometime last summer, a gorgeous, four-winged dragon-fly. A\r\nlittle after dawn, what was once this water nymph or mud dragon, tired\r\nperhaps of its mud existence, ready anyway for the transformation, crawled\r\nup out of the water upon some stone or stick and waited there for its back\r\nto split open up and down. It pulled its soft, boneless legs from their\r\ncases, now lying along the abandoned shell, its wings closely packed\r\ntogether from the two cases on its back and its head and jaws from out the\r\nbroken head shell. Even every air passage running through its body shed\r\nits parchment lining.\r\n\r\nSoft and helpless it crawled away into the grass to wait until its wet,\r\nsoft outer skeleton should harden and make it possible for the powerful\r\nwing muscles to pull against it and for the broad wing films to dry and\r\nstraighten out. By noon the transformation was doubtless quite complete,\r\nand flitting across the pond went the recent inhabitant of this dragon-fly\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE DAMSEL FLY\r\n\r\n(_Agrion maculatum_, Beauvois)\r\n\r\nMost insects' legs are made to walk with, but those of the dragon-fly are\r\nnot. They are bunched together so near the head that when the creature\r\nalights it can do little more than cling to what it lights upon. Instead,\r\nthe legs, with their spines, form a perfect basket, open towards the\r\nfront, and thus become the organs with which flies are caught.\r\n\r\nThis damsel fly, as it is called, is smaller and more delicate than the\r\ndragon-fly with quite a different head. It inhabits shrubby woodland and\r\nis not often seen. Some of its tropical relatives are creatures of\r\nextraordinary fragility and delicacy.\r\n\r\nIts wings, which move in perfect unison, although distinct, are operated\r\nby such ingenious mechanical devices within the body as to have long ago\r\nsuggested a flying machine, and it is strange how like a dragon-fly\r\nProfessor Langley's aerodrome, the first of them all, does look, although\r\nof course the aerodrome's wings were rigid.\r\n\r\nOne realizes what enormous eyes these dragon-flies have when one begins to\r\ncompare them with the size of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE LACE-WINGED FLY AND THE APHIS LION\r\n\r\n(_Chrysopa sp._)\r\n\r\nSo fragile and delicate does this creature appear that one can but wonder\r\nhow it exists in the jungle of the grass. It has a disagreeable odor, it\r\nis said, and this is perhaps the reason that it holds its own, for it\r\nflies so slowly and is so conspicuous that it would otherwise fall a prey\r\nto every insectivorous bird and dragon-fly.\r\n\r\nIts other self is the Aphis Lion, a wingless but very active creature\r\nwhich hunts for plant lice and when it finds one punctures it with its\r\nmandibles, raises it in the air and lets the blood trickle down into its\r\nmouth. It sucks eggs, too, and, shameless creature that it is, it sucks\r\nthose of its own species, or would, at least, if the mother instinct had\r\nnot taught the winged females to lay their eggs on the ends of long,\r\nslender, stiff stems which the undiscriminating larvæ cannot climb, much\r\nas a human mother puts the pot of jam on the top shelf where the children\r\ncannot get it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE WINGED ANT LION\r\n\r\n(_Myrmeleon immaculatus_, De G.)\r\n\r\nAs with many of these monsters, it is the other self, the larva of the\r\nwinged ant lion, which is the fascinating study.\r\n\r\nThis winged form merely lays the egg from which hatches out the soft,\r\nspindle-shaped young with jaws like pincers. This little creature at once\r\nmarks out a tiny circle in some dry, sandy place, and begins to dig a\r\npitfall for its prey, the ants.\r\n\r\nBy pitching the sand with its broad, flat head, just as a man who digs a\r\nwell would pitch out shovelfuls of dirt, the young ant lion excavates a\r\ntiny crater in the sand and hides itself in the crater's pit with its\r\npincers sticking upwards through the fine, loose sand.\r\n\r\nAny child who has jumped into his father's oat bin and tried to climb up\r\nthe hillside of tumbling grain, knows how hard it is to get out. If he\r\nwill imagine a hidden monster waiting with jaws opened at the bottom, he\r\nwill have some sympathy for the unlucky ant which, slipping upon the\r\nrolling sand of the ant lion's crater slides slowly towards its\r\npit--helped perhaps by dirt thrown on it by the ant lion.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no escape, and once within reach, the pincers close on\r\nit, and along their grooved inner faces, helped down by special\r\ntongue-like licking organs, the blood trickles and is guided to the mouth\r\nand thence into the stomach of the lion. And, curiously enough, this\r\nstomach is the only organ of digestion which the ant lion has. The stomach\r\nhas no outlet and everything that is not digested must wait within it\r\nuntil the change of life brings on this winged state, when, like a tiny\r\negg, the gathered excreta of the weeks and even months of feeding is\r\nthrown out from the body. Perhaps this strange structure of the beast has\r\nsomething to do with the fact that it can live six months at least without\r\na particle of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE SCORPION FLY\r\n\r\n(_Panorpa confusa_, Westw.)\r\n\r\nWhen the scorpion fly, standing still, raises above its head that pair of\r\npincers which forms its tail, it seems almost like some two-headed\r\nmonstrosity.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the great Aristotle knew these insects and\r\nthought of them as winged scorpions. It is only the males which have these\r\ncurious tails.\r\n\r\nOne might easily mistake the long snout for that of some sucking insect,\r\nbut at the very tip there are two oblong, plate-shaped jaws, each armed\r\nwith two very sharp teeth which enable the creature to live a carnivorous\r\nexistence. Although little is yet known about it, the scorpion fly\r\nappears, like a hyena, to live chiefly on dead animal matter, although it\r\nhas been seen to attack injured or helpless insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA SOLDIER TERMITE\r\n\r\n(_Termes flavipes_, Koll.)\r\n\r\nAlthough too poor a photograph, perhaps, to be worthy of a place in this\r\ncollection, I have a sentimental reason for its reproduction here, for it\r\nbrings to mind the days I spent in Java lying flat on the ground studying\r\nthe mushroom gardens of its tropical relatives.\r\n\r\nThere are few more interesting creatures than these termites. They have\r\nbeen mushroom eaters and mushroom growers for thousands of years. They\r\nhave their kings and queens, their workers and their soldiers, and they\r\nbuild gigantic caverns and tall mounds out of earth and half-digested\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThey tear to pieces and reduce to powder the dead trees of the tropical\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nTheir nymphs, the young kings and queens, are winged and perform a\r\nmarriage flight, then, tearing off their own wings, they settle down to\r\nform a home of dirt and start a new and numerous colony.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be upon a higher plane of social life than are the true ants,\r\nwith which they are not in any way related, for the members of a species\r\nseem all to be quite friendly towards each other even though they may come\r\nfrom widely different nests. This is never true of ants.\r\n\r\nTheir queens are strange, egg-laying machines as large as a man's thumb,\r\nand they lay an egg a second for nobody knows how long.\r\n\r\nThe workers shun the light and make long, covered ways of mud in which\r\nthey go from place to place. With their untiring energy they honeycomb the\r\nbuilding timbers of houses and ships in the tropics, making mere hollow\r\nshells of them, and so causing disasters of all kinds.\r\n\r\nSome of their soldiers have mandibles so strong and sharp as to drive away\r\nall animals and make them formidable enemies of man, and some have squirt\r\nguns in their heads with which they spray their enemies with an obnoxious\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThis tiny representative is all we have in Maryland, but though so small\r\nand quiet in his habits he does great work among the pine stumps of my\r\nplace. The stump of any pine that is felled one year can be kicked out the\r\nnext, honeycombed with the chambered runways of this creature. Beware lest\r\nany pine timbers of your house are near the ground and become infested\r\nwith termites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STINGING INSECTS\r\n\r\n(_Hymenoptera_)\r\n\r\nThis order is another one in which it takes an entomologist to see the\r\ncharacteristic likenesses in the various species of insects composing it.\r\nThey all have membranous wings, and all the females have either a saw, an\r\novipositor or a sting at the tip of the abdomen. One may say, indeed, that\r\npractically all the stinging insects are in this order.\r\n\r\nBees, wasps, ants, gall flies, saw flies, and ichneumon flies are\r\nHymenoptera, the ants coming into this membranous winged order because the\r\nmales and females are winged for the marriage flight, and lose them only\r\nafter this is over.\r\n\r\nThis is considered the highest order of insects because it contains\r\nmembers with the most marvelously developed instincts of any creatures in\r\nthe world, insects whose habits, skill and industry excite our admiration\r\nand wonder. Whether they live in colonies with highly developed social\r\nstates, or whether they live the lives of solitary hermits, their industry\r\nand sacrifice to keep alive and perpetuate their kind, are things that\r\nmake us wonder whether, after all, we have the right to call ourselves the\r\nmost altruistic of living creatures.\r\n\r\nIt is around these Hymenoptera that centers the great question of what\r\ninstinct is, and how it differs from intelligence. We cannot help but feel\r\nthat it is memory of some kind, not necessarily like the memory of our own\r\nbrains, but a race memory, transmitted in the almost microscopic egg laid\r\nby the mother before she dies.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the bee, or wasp, or ant is quite a different kind of\r\nthing from reason. Since these creatures have stood still in their\r\ndevelopment, or at least have changed but little since tertiary times, it\r\nis quite possible that their present state represents the highest type of\r\nevolution along the lines of instinct. The power to reason, to meet a new\r\nemergency, are things which came much later in the development of the\r\nworld, and man, the creature having them in the highest degree, seems\r\ndestined to control all other creatures in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAIT OF A BALD-FACED HORNET\r\n\r\n(_Vespula maculata_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nI wish I could convey to you my sensation when, in hunting for the focus\r\non my ground glass, this creature burst upon my sight. It was as though,\r\nexploring in some strange land, I suddenly stood face to face with a beast\r\nabout which no schoolbook had ever taught me anything. It peered at me out\r\nof the gloom of imperfect focus, and it took me some time to realize that\r\nI was looking into the eyes of a bald-faced hornet.\r\n\r\nThere is no wild creature in the northern United States that a man will\r\nrun away from so fast as from a bald-faced hornet.\r\n\r\nAt the tip of her flexible armor-plated abdomen is the poison-fed stiletto\r\nwith which she drives off enemies from the nest or paralyzes her prey.\r\n\r\nHer six powerful legs are spined to help her, no doubt, in climbing over\r\nthe smooth surfaces of flowers and twigs. She has two kinds of eyes--three\r\nlens-shaped ones on top of her head and two marvelous compound ones\r\ncomposed of hundreds of little lenses, which take up half the head. Just\r\nwhat she uses each kind for is still unknown.\r\n\r\nFrom her forehead hang ringed antennæ, which doubtless are the organs with\r\nwhich she scents the presence of her prey, and they may also help her find\r\nher way about.\r\n\r\nHer massive jaws lie below her eyes and look like shears with jagged\r\nedges; they are meant for crushing, not for grinding, and with these she\r\ntears to pieces bits of wood and cements the particles together with the\r\nsticky secretion of her salivary glands, making thus the combs and shelter\r\nof her wood-pulp paper nest.\r\n\r\nShe is an undeveloped female, but with the professional care of a baby's\r\nnurse she tends her sister hornets in the nest. On the wing, from daylight\r\nto dark, she scours the country for the flies and other insects with which\r\nto feed the young. Of all the fly-destroyers which frequent the house she\r\nis perhaps the most efficient, pouncing upon the flies with murderous\r\nvoracity, tearing off their heads and legs and wings, and macerating their\r\nbodies to a pulp to feed the hungry grub-like baby hornets which are\r\nhatching out in the paper nest over the front door. Her life, and the life\r\nof every other worker, is ended by the autumn, and it is left to a few of\r\nthe young queens to carry on the species.\r\n\r\nDoes this picture represent, I wonder, one of the nightmare visions which\r\nhaunt the dreams of baby flies?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN HORNET\r\n\r\n(_Vespula maculata_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nThe summer was over but the cold weather had scarcely begun when I found\r\nthis creature under a rotten log in the pasture. The paper nest over the\r\nfront door was empty and rapidly falling to pieces, but even so, it was\r\nhard to believe that the active, dangerous creatures we had watched for so\r\nmany weeks had suddenly disappeared, and that, of the whole busy colony,\r\nonly a few females were left.\r\n\r\nThere is something fascinating in the picture of the young queen hornet,\r\nafter mating is over and all her relatives are dead, crawling away beneath\r\nsome log and passing there the long cold winter. Then, when spring has\r\ncome, she emerges from her sleep, the only survivor of her race, and\r\nbuilds, unaided even by her mate, the beginning of a nest just large\r\nenough to hold her first-laid eggs. From these hatch out the grubs, which\r\nlater, after days of feeding, emerge as workers, undeveloped females, and\r\nhelp build up around her a colony of hundreds of busy hornets.\r\n\r\nThe death of the wasp and hornet workers does not seem to be a matter of\r\ncold alone, for, in the regions of perpetual summer, the workers of many\r\nspecies live short lives. They feel the cold, of course, as all our\r\ninsects do, and inside the nest, on the shelves formed by the flat tops of\r\nthe combs where the larvæ live, they find dry roosting places at night.\r\nThe heat of their own bodies materially raises the temperature inside the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nThough many people think them just alike, the bees and wasps (the hornet\r\nis a kind of wasp) are very different creatures. The wasps have trim,\r\nslender forms with a few scattered hairs upon their bodies, whereas the\r\nbees are generally hairy and short bodied. They both build combs, but the\r\nwasps make theirs of paper wetted with saliva, while the bees build theirs\r\nof wax secreted from their bodies. The wasps depend upon fresh food\r\ngathered in the day's hunt through the air, whereas the bees store up\r\ntheir food in empty cells. The wasps' nests are the wigwams of a season,\r\nthe bees' hives the more permanent abodes of a higher type of social\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW JACKET\r\n\r\n(_Vespa carolina_, Dru.)\r\n\r\nWho has not wished that these brown and yellow striped creatures would\r\nbuild their nests where people could see them and be warned to stay away,\r\ninstead of underneath the ground as they do now.\r\n\r\nThey hunt in flocks, and it is no wonder that with the sides of their\r\nheads all eyes and with three other eyes on the top of the head they\r\nshould quickly find anyone who treads on their underground nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nONE OF THE SOCIAL WASPS\r\n\r\n(_Polistes metrica_, Say)\r\n\r\nNo insect's nest is better known than the small, hanging, paper comb of\r\nthis social wasp. You find it under eaves and suspended from the ceiling\r\nof the porch and from the rafters of the barn. Then, as the cold days of\r\nautumn come and the workers and males of the colony die off, their\r\nhibernating queens seek shelter from the cold in our houses.\r\n\r\nIn the spring these queens start out to build a few small, paper cells\r\nwith finely chewed up fibers of wood wet with sticky saliva. In these they\r\nrear up workers to help add new cells and gather food for a new family,\r\nand before the summer season has rolled by, the few small paper cells have\r\ngrown to several scores.\r\n\r\nIf you have the hardihood to stand quite close to one of these nests you\r\nwill see the grubs with hungry-looking mouths, wiggling and stretching out\r\ntheir necks, each in a cell quite open to the air, waiting to be fed by\r\nits sister or the queen. As to which will come forth from these white\r\ngrubs as queens, which as males, and which are doomed to be but\r\nworkers--undeveloped females--nobody can foretell, but certain it is that\r\nthere will be all three of these forms represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA MUD DAUBER WASP\r\n\r\n(_Sceliphron cementarium_, Klug)\r\n\r\nThink of all the marvelous mechanism and chemistry required in order that\r\na wasp may feed its young upon fresh meat!\r\n\r\nThe solitary wasps have stings whose venom is much less powerful than that\r\nof the bees. Fabre declares that his experiments convince him that the\r\nreason may lie in the fact that for paralyzing its prey the wasp needs\r\nonly a weak poison whereas when the bee stings it does so in self-defense\r\nand it stings to kill.\r\n\r\nThe busy mud dauber females build their nests of mud brought from the\r\nnearest puddle and in each carefully made cell lay an egg and around it\r\npack the paralyzed insects on which the voracious little grubs begin to\r\nfeed as soon as they hatch out.\r\n\r\nBy the time the young grubs have eaten up the food that has been so\r\nthoughtfully supplied by their parents and have changed from grub to pupa\r\nand emerged as flying, stinging wasps, their parents are dead and gone.\r\nImagine, if you can, a civilization in which the mothers slave for\r\noffspring which they never see, and the children grow up with no\r\neducation, yet possessed of all the knowledge that their parents had. As\r\nSharpe remarks, the solitary wasps are among the most instinctive\r\ncreatures of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD OF A MUD DAUBER'S BABY\r\n\r\nThis little white spider I found in the nest of a mud dauber wasp.\r\n\r\nHow long this white spider would have lived its paralyzed existence I do\r\nnot know. Fabre has watched insects so paralyzed for six weeks, and this\r\none was on my table for several weeks in June without moving and without\r\nshowing any sign of decay.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to think of the wonders of cold storage as a result of\r\nthis age of invention, and to look upon its achievement as the\r\naccomplishment of the human brain. The mud dauber, in common with most of\r\nthe so-called solitary wasps, possesses the means of paralyzing the nerve\r\ncenters of its prey and thus preserving it alive for weeks in the nests of\r\nthe baby wasps. With the most amazing aim it darts its poison sting\r\nbetween the joints in the armor plate of its victim and touches with a\r\ndrop of poison one of the nerve ganglia which lies on the abdominal side\r\nof most insects.\r\n\r\nFabre has shown that the same result can be produced by a needle and a\r\ndrop of ammonia, and insects paralyzed in this way hang, as it were,\r\nbetween life and death for weeks or months. If too heavy a dose is given\r\nthe insect dies in a few hours and putrifies in a few days, and if given\r\ntoo light an application it soon recovers. Different insects require\r\ndifferent amounts of the poison to paralyze them and the solitary wasps\r\nmake mistakes just as man would do. According to Fabre these insects have\r\nalso discovered that in certain species of their prey the nerve ganglia\r\nare grouped close together and can be easily reached with the poison while\r\nin others the ganglia are separated, and each ganglion must be touched.\r\n\r\nIt is a weird thought that for thousands of centuries these creatures have\r\nhad a perfectly satisfactory way of preserving and storing fresh food\r\nwhile man still kills his animal food and is now quarreling as to how it\r\nshould be stored and whether if frozen for months it is really good to\r\neat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE FIG INSECT ON WHICH DEPENDS A GREAT PLANT INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n(_Blastophaga grossorum_, Grav.)\r\n\r\nInto every dried Smyrna fig that you eat a queer little beast like this\r\nhas crawled; unless she does so, no seeds will form, for the inside of a\r\nyoung fig is filled with flowers waiting to be dusted with pollen and it\r\ncannot develop until this is done. This tiny, female wasp, so small you\r\ncan scarcely see her with the naked eye, is the pollen duster of this\r\nminiature flower garden.\r\n\r\nThe Blastophaga hatches out from a tiny egg which her mother lays in a\r\nspecial flower or gall in the flower cavity of a wild, inedible Caprifig\r\nthat came originally from the islands off the Syrian coast. Her mate, an\r\nugly little thing with no wings at all, hatches out before she does and\r\nmates with her even before she comes out of her tiny cocoon. After\r\nwandering about among the stamens in the cavity in the Caprifig until her\r\nback and sides are covered with pollen, she finds her way out through the\r\nhole in the end of the ripening wild fig and flies away in search of\r\nanother young and ripening fig in whose gall flowers instinct impels her\r\nto lay her eggs.\r\n\r\nThe larger, juicier Smyrna fig attracts her, and she crawls inside,\r\nsearching for gall flowers there. But the Smyrna fig has no special places\r\nfor her eggs and, after wandering around over the flowers in the floral\r\ncavity she wanders out again, or dies. But in this scramble over the\r\nsticky stigmas of the Smyrna fig flowers, she irritates them and leaves\r\nupon them the pollen which she brought with her from the wild fig. This is\r\nwhat causes the young seeds of the Smyrna fig to grow and the fig itself\r\nto swell and become the honey-sweet fruit which we eat.\r\n\r\nWithout the visits of this tiny wasp the figs either fall off on the\r\nground when young, or else form insipid tasteless fruits. So it might be\r\nsaid that the great fig industry of Smyrna hangs on the blundering\r\ninstinct of this little creature.\r\n\r\nSome enterprising Californians brought over and planted orchards of the\r\nSmyrna fig and could not understand why they did not bear. Then they\r\nbrought in the wild Caprifig from Smyrna and planted it side by side with\r\nthe Smyrna figs, but still with no result. Finally the experts of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture were called in and solved the problem by\r\nintroducing the insect, which had been left behind.\r\n\r\nThis little creature, in the picture, crawled out in my laboratory from a\r\nCaprifig which Doctor Rixford, the fig expert of California, sent me,\r\nrequesting that I photograph his pets.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE COW KILLER OR VELVET ANT--A WINGLESS WASP\r\n\r\n(_Mutilla simillima_, Sm.)\r\n\r\nCan you imagine an insect daring enough to brave the stings of the\r\nthousands of workers in a bee's nest? This wingless, solitary female ant\r\nlives habitually in their nests and eats the food they have so busily\r\ngathered, an unbidden and probably a most unwelcome guest. Powerful jaws,\r\nformidable sting, an armor-plated shell to protect her from the stings of\r\nthe bees and wasps in whose nests she lives, seem to fit her for the\r\nstrange life she leads.\r\n\r\nIf you should find her mate he would doubtless be on the wing, for unlike\r\nall others of the order, it is the male alone which flies. So different\r\nfrom their mates do some of these male cow killers look that they have\r\noften been mistaken for quite different species.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the female lays her eggs inside a bumble-bee grub and\r\nin a few days' time they hatch and eat the babies up, from the inside\r\noutwards. Then they hatch again, so to speak, as full-fledged cow killers\r\nand feast upon the honey of their hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE WORKER BUMBLE-BEE\r\n\r\n(_Bombus vagans_, Sm.)\r\n\r\nEverybody has a friendly feeling for the bumble-bee, that clumsy rover of\r\nthe clover field whose buzzing seems part of the still summer air. She is\r\nthe real worker of the hive, an undeveloped female, her hind legs laden\r\nwith a mass of pollen from the flowers she has visited, and her honey sac\r\nfilled with nectar.\r\n\r\nAs every boy who has hunted her nest will know, the bumble-bee lives in\r\nburrows under ground.\r\n\r\nThe cells that she makes are of wax, secreted from special plates which\r\nlie arranged in rows beneath her hairy body. Each cell is like a little\r\njar, standing on end, quite different from the cells in a honey bee's\r\ncomb. In some of these the eggs are laid and the baby bees hatch out,\r\nwhile others are filled up with nectar.\r\n\r\nWhile the bee is gathering pollen with her legs, she is also gathering\r\nnectar with her tongue and storing it in a special honey stomach from\r\nwhich she later regurgitates it into the honey cells in her nest.\r\n\r\nThe nectar, when it is gathered, is thin, like the sap of the maple tree,\r\nand, like it, must be condensed. Part of the water seems to be taken out\r\nin the honey stomach, and part evaporates from the honey cell.\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, be a satisfaction to those who hate getting up early to\r\nknow that there is a well-founded rumor that some bumble-bees have a\r\ntrumpeter who, somewhere between three and four o'clock in the morning,\r\nwakes up the sleepy hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE POLLEN PLATES OF THE BUMBLE-BEE\r\n\r\n(_Bombus americanorum_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nIf you will watch a bumble-bee closely as she crawls over the stamens of a\r\nwild rose, perhaps you can see that, although she covers the whole under\r\npart of her body with pollen, yet she scrapes off all she can with her\r\nfeet and packs it in a yellow mass on the smooth, hairless segments of her\r\nlarge hind legs, the pollen plates as they are called. To make the pollen\r\nstick on these smooth plates and hang together during the flight to the\r\nnest, it is claimed by Muller that the bee mixes nectar with the pollen\r\ngrains. The kind of pollen that she gathers is, however, not generally the\r\ndusty kind, like the pollen of the pines or grasses, but the sticky kind\r\nthat comes from insect-fertilized flowers. When the bumble-bee reaches her\r\nnest, she scrapes the pollen from the pollen basket and with it feeds the\r\nyoung, for pollen is the solid food of baby bees.\r\n\r\nThere is one strange thing about these smooth pollen plate legs which,\r\nfrom our human, individualistic point of view, is hard to understand. It\r\nis only the workers, the undeveloped females, which have them; the legs of\r\nthe males and of the queens are hairy and are not at all adapted for\r\npollen gathering. Thus, since workers bear no children, we see a race of\r\nparents transmitting to certain of their offspring characters which\r\nneither they nor any of their ancestors have ever possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE BUMBLE-BEE AT WORK\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows the great hybridizer at work.\r\n\r\nShe is on one of the single roses, her hairy body spread over the stamens\r\nwhich, with their yellow anthers, look like a circular bed of tulips. In\r\nthe middle of the circle, where her right foot rests, is the stigma.\r\n\r\nIf you will sometime take a hand lens and watch a bee at work (and if you\r\ndon't get too close she will pay no attention to you), you will notice the\r\nclumsy way she crawls about, knocking the pollen off the stamens and\r\ngetting her body covered with the yellow dust. As you watch, any feeling\r\nof there being some mystery about cross fertilization will be dispelled.\r\nHow this same bumble-bee could crawl across another rose blossom _without_\r\nleaving a trail of yellow pollen on its stigma would be the mystery!\r\n\r\nSince the earliest days of the world of plants and insects, the bumble-bee\r\nand her ancestors have been at work mixing the pollen on hundreds of\r\ndifferent plants and playing, doubtless, a perfectly gigantic role in the\r\ncreation of the flowering plants which now cover vast areas of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps an idle speculation, but it would be interesting to know how\r\nmany plants would become extinct were some disease or parasite to\r\nexterminate the bees.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE TELLTALE MILKWEED POLLEN\r\n\r\n(_Bombus sp._)\r\n\r\nAlthough this bumble-bee was caught in flight across my meadow, her\r\nphotograph shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that she had been a recent\r\nvisitor to the blossom of some milkweed, for, projecting from her right\r\nhind leg and plainly visible, are the pollen masses of the milkweed\r\nflower. They look like little paddles and hang in pairs, although this you\r\ncannot see in the picture.\r\n\r\nWe know that flowers depend upon the bees to fertilize them, but somehow I\r\ndo not think we grasp the completeness of this dependence, nor realize how\r\nmany flowers there are which, unless they have their own pet insect\r\nvisitors, would soon become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe milkweed lures its visitor with little cups of nectar, and beside each\r\ncup it sets a trap which is as carefully worked out as the steel traps\r\nwhich the modern trappers use. Across the top of a little slit, wide below\r\nand narrow above, lie the small ends of the paddles or pollen masses,\r\nfirmly joined together. As the bee alights to sup the nectar, her foot\r\nslips into this crack, and in trying to extricate it she pulls up the pair\r\nof paddles which fasten themselves onto a hair of her leg like a\r\nclothespin on a line. In drying, the paddles clap together in such a way\r\nthat by the time another milkweed flower is visited they can slip with the\r\nleg right into the little slit and are broken off and left there as the\r\nbee again pulls out her leg. Once inside, these pollen grains throw out a\r\nscore or more of tiny, rootlike tubes which grow into the lining of the\r\nslit and carry to the ovary below the fertilizing germ plasm which makes\r\nthe seed develop.\r\n\r\nThe bumble-bee, of course, is strong enough to slip into these traps and\r\npull her legs out as a routine thing, but many small moths and butterflies\r\nare not, and these get caught and die upon the blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE POOR MALE BUMBLE-BEE\r\n\r\n(_Bombus americanorum_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nIt was late in October before I noticed, flying low here and there across\r\nthe clover tops, large bumble-bees, which seemed to be more covered with\r\ngolden hairs than those which I had watched throughout the summer time. At\r\nfirst I thought them queens, but as their number multiplied I felt I must\r\nbe mistaken, and one of my insect-knowing friends explained that they were\r\nonly males, and that with the approaching days of winter they were all\r\ndoomed to death. Already, he pointed out, their wings were battered and\r\nfrayed from flying against the autumn winds.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the males! Could there be a weaker argument against\r\nwoman's suffrage than the one which has been brought forward that\r\nthroughout nature the duty and the right of protection rests with the\r\nmale? Perhaps the drones do fight among themselves; but, as in most other\r\nfighting of the males, it is not to protect the nest or young from\r\nperishing, but merely to determine which one of them shall win the queen's\r\nattention. The males are stingless.\r\n\r\nIn this world of the clover field all the work of the society is done by\r\nthe queen herself, or by the workers, which are infertile females.\r\nApparently few males are wanted in the colony until late in the season,\r\nwhen, for a brief period, they are tolerated in considerable numbers as\r\nthe necessary courtiers who accompany the young queens of late summer in\r\ntheir marriage flight. This takes place before the winter comes to kill\r\nall but a few fortunate queens, which find safe shelter in some crevice in\r\nthe rocks or underneath some old, decaying log.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSOLITARY LEAF-CUTTING BEE\r\n\r\n(_Megachile brevis_, Say)\r\n\r\nUnlike the social honey and bumble-bees, this bee leads a solitary life.\r\n\r\nWith her strong, saw-like jaws, the female makes her burrow in soft wood\r\nand lines it with bits of leaf which she has cut from some plant. When the\r\nleaves of plants in the garden have large round holes in them, in nine\r\ncases out of ten you may be sure that they have been cut by some solitary\r\nbee.\r\n\r\nWhen the burrow is complete she makes a ball of pollen and nectar, puts it\r\nin the bottom of the burrow, lays an egg upon it, and, with a wad of\r\nleaves, securely shuts it in; over this she lays down another food ball\r\nwith its corresponding egg, and so on, until the burrow is full.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE STINGER OF THE LEAF-CUTTING BEE\r\n\r\n(_Megachile brevis_, Say)\r\n\r\nThe sting or \"stinger\" of a bee is indeed a most wonderful piece of\r\nmechanism. At the base, inside the body of the bee, lie bars or levers,\r\noperated by muscles, which push the darts out and draw them in. The poison\r\nsac lies just behind this mechanism and pours the poison into a set of\r\ncup-like valves, from which it escapes into the wound along longitudinal\r\ngrooves in the sting like grease along the piston of an engine.\r\n\r\nThe sting itself is not, then, hollow, like the spider's poison fang, but\r\nis a poisoned stiletto as long as the bee's foreleg which she can thrust\r\nin and out with incredible rapidity, and which, as everyone knows, can\r\ninflict a painful wound on creatures millions of times her size.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA COMMON RED ANT\r\n\r\n(_Formica sp._)\r\n\r\nAnts are undoubtedly the highest, structurally and mechanically, of all\r\ninsects, and at the same time the most efficient. Their social\r\norganization has been the admiration of human beings from the earliest\r\ntimes, because the interest of the individual is merged so completely into\r\nthat of the colony; but, as Wheeler remarks, their organization must\r\nstrike the individualist with horror.\r\n\r\nIt is an organization of females, too. The workers are females, the\r\nsoldiers are females, the nurses are females, and there is one queen\r\nmother for them all, who lays all the eggs of the colony. Where are the\r\nmales, those representatives of society, those voters of our human\r\ncolonies? They do not exist as such, for the males of ant colonies are but\r\nmates for the young queens. Together with them they leave the nest on\r\ntheir marriage day and together make the marriage flight, but as soon as\r\nthis is over they die, and the colony gets on easily without them.\r\n\r\nTo man, who is the most rapidly evolving organism on the earth today, it\r\nis a strange thought that the most highly developed insect which the world\r\nhas produced, and which has not changed materially since the Tertiary\r\nepoch, has relegated the males to the short-lived function of\r\nreproduction, leaving him no work to perform and getting rid of him as\r\nquickly as possible. Why did the ants, with their marvelous instincts,\r\nfail to conquer the world? Why have they stood still for thousands of\r\nyears after they had perfected their social organization? Did they go as\r\nfar as evolution could go when it leaves the male out of account? It is\r\nperhaps a comfort to think that, after all, they have failed and the\r\nman-guided organization of human beings has surpassed them in its\r\ndevelopment!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA BLACK ANT\r\n\r\nIt is strange to think that just because the sunlight which poured upon\r\nthis little creature's shiny body was reflected back against a\r\nphotographic plate, its rays being made to diverge widely in so doing, we\r\ncan get an image of this tiny ant as large as though it were a mouse.\r\n\r\nWhat a world this would be to us had we microscopic vision! A thousand\r\ntimes as many beasts to look at, a thousand times as many things to see\r\nand understand!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nANT GATHERING NECTAR FROM LEAF NECTARIES OF THE CHINESE WOOD-OIL TREE\r\n\r\nA year ago I planted in my garden in Maryland three young wood-oil trees\r\nfrom the Yangtse valley of China, broad-leaved trees something like the\r\ncatalpa. Just where the leaf stem joined the leaf blade there were two\r\ncurious, dark red, oval glands. The use of these I did not understand\r\nuntil one morning I discovered a big black ant on each leaf, and each ant\r\nwas stationed at the base of its leaf near these glands and evidently was\r\nlapping up from them small drops of nectar which kept oozing out from the\r\ncenter of each gland.\r\n\r\nThese rapidly-walking little creatures, which spend their time roaming\r\neverywhere, had discovered the use of these nectar glands although they\r\nwere on the leaves of a plant which they had never seen before.\r\n\r\nWhenever I touched a leaf the ant upon it ran about as if to frighten an\r\nintruder away, and I could not help but wonder if in China, where the\r\nwood-oil tree is at home, there might not be some stinging ant which takes\r\nupon itself to protect the foliage from the attacks of caterpillars, and\r\ngets, in payment for its labor, the nectar from these glands. The tropics\r\nare full of such agreements between the plants and the ants, and very\r\neffective ones they are, too.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows a black ant with antennæ extended, reaching over one\r\nof these big glands for the drop of nectar which glistens just below its\r\nhead. On the other gland, just back of the ant's left antenna, a second\r\ndrop of nectar can be seen.\r\n\r\nFirst one and then the other of these nectaries is licked clean by the\r\nant, and so well was the work done that throughout the summer it was only\r\nwhen I visited the leaves in early morning, before the ants were out, that\r\nI could find the beads of nectar in their places in slight depressions in\r\nthe glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE ICHNEUMON FLY: ENEMY OF THE SPIDER\r\n\r\n(_Crypturopsis sp._)\r\n\r\nIt would seem as though the spider ought to be able to protect itself from\r\nsuch a beautiful creature as this, but she is said to be one of the\r\nspider's worst enemies. With the long ovipositors which may be seen in the\r\nphotograph and might almost be mistaken for her sting, she lays her eggs\r\ninside those of the spider and the larvæ hatching from them eat up the\r\nspider's eggs. It is, so to say, an insect cuckoo, or worse than that, for\r\nthe bird cuckoo only crowds the real children out of the nest, whereas the\r\nichneumon fly devours them.\r\n\r\nFrom man's point of view, however, many of the tribe to which this\r\nso-called fly belongs are his good friends, for they hold in check some of\r\nthe pests which molest the plants he lives upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF MYRIAPODS AND A SINGLE LAND CRUSTACEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF MYRIAPODS AND A LAND CRUSTACEAN\r\n\r\nEvery one who has turned over a rotten log has seen these thousand-legged\r\nworms, and yet I wonder if many of us have known that these weird\r\nwandering things resemble, and are the direct living descendants of some\r\nof the first animals which crept up out of the sea to live upon the land.\r\n\r\nLong ages before the warm-blooded, lung-breathing beasts came into\r\nexistence, they worked their way up out of their water life among the\r\ncorals, sponges, worms, shellfish, and fishes, onto the dry land.\r\n\r\nThis was in the great transition time when all sorts of amphibian monsters\r\ncame into existence, monsters which have long since passed away. These\r\nmyriapods deserve respect if for no other reason than because their\r\nforefathers crept across the fresh footprints and mud wallows of the\r\nprehistoric monsters.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that these forms of life have changed so little in a million\r\nyears?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA MILLIPEDE, ONE OF THE VEGETARIAN MYRIAPODS\r\n\r\nSlow moving ringed creature with four legs to each ring or segment of its\r\nbody! Watch its legs move in ripples as it finds its way over the ground!\r\nUnlike its distant relative, the centipede, which has but two legs to each\r\nbody ring and darts about with most surprising rapidity, this millipede\r\nlives mainly on plant food and seldom eats, as does its savage relative,\r\nthe bodies of small animals which make their home beneath old rotten\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA CENTIPEDE, ONE OF THE CARNIVEROUS MYRIAPODS\r\n\r\n(_Scolopendra sp._)\r\n\r\nPerhaps no photograph in the collection serves better to illustrate the\r\nvastness of the back yard jungle than this one, for myriapods are the only\r\nrepresentatives of a gigantic branch of the animal kingdom, the\r\nindividuals of which are no more insects than they are lobsters. They live\r\ntheir lives altogether on or in the ground, they do not mind the cold as\r\ninsects do. Some of them have poison fangs and are reputed to inflict\r\nfatal wounds. Their matrimonial habits are strange beyond belief.\r\n\r\nThey compose a vast neglected assemblage of creatures which some of their\r\nadmirers believe have a value which we do not yet understand nor\r\nappreciate; just as we did not appreciate the role of the mosquito or the\r\nearth worm until the researches of modern science taught us of their\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nA great untouched field for exploration lies here among the Myriapods.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTWO PILL BUGS\r\n\r\n(_Armadillidium vulgare_, Fab.)\r\n\r\nDown from the time of the prehistoric monsters comes the armadillidium,\r\nthe last survivor of the great land crustaceans. As the serpents and the\r\nlizards are all that remain to remind us of the monsters which swarmed and\r\nfought in the tertiary swamps and oceans, so this strange creature, no\r\nlarger than a pea, which rolls itself into a ball when you startle it as\r\nyou turn over a stone in the meadow, is the survivor of the land crustacea\r\nwhich at one time, in countless forms, abounded everywhere in the then\r\nyoung world.\r\n\r\nIt is not an insect, but a last survivor, related to the crabs more\r\nclosely than to any other branch of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ant Lion, Winged, 207.\r\n\r\n  Ants--Black, 247.\r\n    Common Red, 245.\r\n    Gathering Nectar, 249.\r\n\r\n  Aphis Lion, 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bee-flies 157, 159.\r\n\r\n  Bee, Solitary Leaf-cutting, 241.\r\n    Stinger of the Leaf-cutting, 243.\r\n    See Bumble-bee.\r\n\r\n  Beetle, 111.\r\n    Blister, 127.\r\n    Chafer.
