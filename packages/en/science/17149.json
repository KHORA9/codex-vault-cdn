Some of the most picturesque features of this awakening reached\r\nthe great public through the press. Thus, the adventurous trips of the\r\n_Deutschland_ with its cargoes of concentrated aniline dyes, valued at\r\nmillions of dollars, emphasized as no other incident our former\r\ndependence upon Germany for these products of her chemical industries.\r\n\r\nThe public read, too, that her chemists saved Germany from an early\r\ndisastrous defeat, both in the field of military operations and in the\r\nmatter of economic supplies: unquestionably, without the tremendous\r\nexpansion of her plants for the production of nitrates and ammonia from\r\nthe air by the processes of Haber, Ostwald and others of her great\r\nchemists, the war would have ended in 1915, or early in 1916, from\r\nexhaustion of Germany's supplies of nitrate explosives, if not indeed\r\nfrom exhaustion of her food supplies as a consequence of the lack of\r\nnitrate and ammonia fertilizer for her fields. Inventions of substitutes\r\nfor cotton, copper, rubber, wool and many other basic needs have been\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nThese feats of chemistry, performed under the stress of dire necessity,\r\nhave, no doubt, excited the wonder and interest of our public. It is far\r\nmore important at this time, however, when both for war and for peace\r\nneeds, the resources of our country are strained to the utmost, that the\r\npublic should awaken to a clear realization of what this science of\r\nchemistry really means for mankind, to the realization that its wizardry\r\npermeates the whole life of the nation as a vitalizing, protective and\r\nconstructive agent very much in the same way as our blood, coursing\r\nthrough our veins and arteries, carries the constructive, defensive and\r\nlife-bringing materials to every organ in the body.\r\n\r\nIf the layman will but understand that chemistry is the fundamental\r\n_science of the transformation of matter_, he will readily accept the\r\nvalidity of this sweeping assertion: he will realize, for instance, why\r\nexactly the same fundamental laws of the science apply to, and make\r\npossible scientific control of, such widely divergent national\r\nindustries as agriculture and steel manufacturing. It governs the\r\ntransformation of the salts, minerals and humus of our fields and the\r\ncomponents of the air into corn, wheat, cotton and the innumerable other\r\nproducts of the soil; it governs no less the transformation of crude\r\nores into steel and alloys, which, with the cunning born of chemical\r\nknowledge, may be given practically any conceivable quality of hardness,\r\nelasticity, toughness or strength. And exactly the same thing may be\r\nsaid of the hundreds of national activities that lie between the two\r\nextremes of agriculture and steel manufacture!\r\n\r\nMoreover, the domain of the science of the transformation of matter\r\nincludes even life itself as its loftiest phase: from our birth to our\r\nreturn to dust the laws of chemistry are the controlling laws of life,\r\nhealth, disease and death, and the ever clearer recognition of this\r\nrelation is the strongest force that is raising medicine from the\r\nuncertain realm of an art to the safer sphere of an exact science. To\r\nmany scientific minds it has even become evident that those most\r\nwonderful facts of life, heredity and character, must find their final\r\nexplanation in the chemical composition of the components of life\r\nproducing, germinal protoplasm: mere form and shape are no longer\r\nsupreme but are relegated to their proper place as the housing only of\r\nthe living matter which functions chemically.\r\n\r\nIt must be quite obvious now why thoughtful men are insisting that the\r\npublic should be awakened to a broad realization of the significance of\r\nthe science of chemistry for its national life.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult science in its details, because it has found that it\r\ncan best interpret the visible phenomena of the material world on the\r\nbasis of the conception of invisible minute material atoms and\r\nmolecules, each a world in itself, whose properties may be nevertheless\r\naccurately deduced by a rigorous logic controlling the highest type of\r\nscientific imagination. But a layman is interested in the wonders of\r\ngreat bridges and of monumental buildings without feeling the need of\r\ninquiring into the painfully minute and extended calculations of the\r\nengineer and architect of the strains and stresses to which every pin\r\nand every bar of the great bridge and every bit of stone, every foot of\r\narch in a monumental edifice, will be exposed. So the public may\r\nunderstand and appreciate with the keenest interest the results of\r\nchemical effort without the need of instruction in the intricacies of\r\nour logic, of our dealings with our minute, invisible particles.\r\n\r\nThe whole nation's welfare demands, indeed, that our public be\r\nenlightened in the matter of the relation of chemistry to our national\r\nlife. Thus, if our commerce and our industries are to survive the\r\nterrific competition that must follow the reëstablishment of peace, our\r\npublic must insist that its representatives in Congress preserve that\r\nindependence in chemical manufacturing which the war has forced upon us\r\nin the matter of dyes, of numberless invaluable remedies to cure and\r\nrelieve suffering; in the matter, too, of hundreds of chemicals, which\r\nour industries need for their successful existence.\r\n\r\nUnless we are independent in these fields, how easily might an\r\nunscrupulous competing nation do us untold harm by the mere device, for\r\ninstance, of delaying supplies, or by sending inferior materials to this\r\ncountry or by underselling our chemical manufacturers and, after the\r\ndestruction of our chemical independence, handicapping our industries as\r\nthey were in the first year or two of the great war! This is not a mere\r\npossibility created by the imagination, for our economic history\r\ncontains instance after instance of the purposeful undermining and\r\ndestruction of our industries in finer chemicals, dyes and drugs by\r\nforeign interests bent on preserving their monopoly. If one recalls that\r\nthrough control, for instance, of dyes by a competing nation, control is\r\nin fact also established over products, valued in the hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars, in which dyes enter as an essential factor, one\r\nmay realize indeed the tremendous industrial and commercial power which\r\nis controlled by the single lever--chemical dyes. Of even more vital\r\nmoment is chemistry in the domain of health: the pitiful calls of our\r\nhospitals for local anesthetics to alleviate suffering on the operating\r\ntable, the frantic appeals for the hypnotic that soothes the epileptic\r\nand staves off his seizure, the almost furious demands for remedy after\r\nremedy, that came in the early years of the war, are still ringing in\r\nthe hearts of many of us. No wonder that our small army of chemists is\r\ngrimly determined not to give up the independence in chemistry which war\r\nhas achieved for us! Only a widely enlightened public, however, can\r\ninsure the permanence of what farseeing men have started to accomplish\r\nin developing the power of chemistry through research in every domain\r\nwhich chemistry touches.\r\n\r\nThe general public should realize that in the support of great chemical\r\nresearch laboratories of universities and technical schools it will be\r\nsustaining important centers from which the science which improves\r\nproducts, abolishes waste, establishes new industries and preserves\r\nlife, may reach out helpfully into all the activities of our great\r\nnation, that are dependent on the transformation of matter.\r\n\r\nThe public is to be congratulated upon the fact that the writer of the\r\npresent volume is better qualified than any other man in the country to\r\nbring home to his readers some of the great results of modern chemical\r\nactivity as well as some of the big problems which must continue to\r\nengage the attention of our chemists. Dr. Slosson has indeed the unique\r\nquality of combining an exact and intimate knowledge of chemistry with\r\nthe exquisite clarity and pointedness of expression of a born writer.\r\n\r\nWe have here an exposition by a master mind, an exposition shorn of the\r\nterrifying and obscuring technicalities of the lecture room, that will\r\nbe as absorbing reading as any thrilling romance. For the story of\r\nscientific achievement is the greatest epic the world has ever known,\r\nand like the great national epics of bygone ages, should quicken the\r\nlife of the nation by a realization of its powers and a picture of its\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATIVE CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n     La Chimie posséde cette faculté créatrice à un degré plus\r\n     éminent que les autres sciences, parce qu'elle pénètre plus\r\n     profondément et atteint jusqu'aux éléments naturels des êtres.\r\n\r\n     --_Berthelot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHREE PERIODS OF PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Robinson Crusoe is an allegory of human history. Man is a\r\ncastaway upon a desert planet, isolated from other inhabited worlds--if\r\nthere be any such--by millions of miles of untraversable space. He is\r\nabsolutely dependent upon his own exertions, for this world of his, as\r\nWells says, has no imports except meteorites and no exports of any kind.\r\nMan has no wrecked ship from a former civilization to draw upon for\r\ntools and weapons, but must utilize as best he may such raw materials as\r\nhe can find. In this conquest of nature by man there are three stages\r\ndistinguishable:\r\n\r\n  1. The Appropriative Period\r\n  2. The Adaptive Period\r\n  3. The Creative Period\r\n\r\nThese eras overlap, and the human race, or rather its vanguard,\r\ncivilized man, may be passing into the third stage in one field of human\r\nendeavor while still lingering in the second or first in some other\r\nrespect. But in any particular line this sequence is followed. The\r\nprimitive man picks up whatever he can find available for his use. His\r\nsuccessor in the next stage of culture shapes and develops this crude\r\ninstrument until it becomes more suitable for his purpose. But in the\r\ncourse of time man often finds that he can make something new which is\r\nbetter than anything in nature or naturally produced. The savage\r\ndiscovers. The barbarian improves. The civilized man invents. The first\r\nfinds. The second fashions. The third fabricates.\r\n\r\nThe primitive man was a troglodyte. He sought shelter in any cave or\r\ncrevice that he could find. Later he dug it out to make it more roomy\r\nand piled up stones at the entrance to keep out the wild beasts. This\r\nartificial barricade, this false façade, was gradually extended and\r\nsolidified until finally man could build a cave for himself anywhere in\r\nthe open field from stones he quarried out of the hill. But man was not\r\ncontent with such materials and now puts up a building which may be\r\ncomposed of steel, brick, terra cotta, glass, concrete and plaster, none\r\nof which materials are to be found in nature.\r\n\r\nThe untutored savage might cross a stream astride a floating tree trunk.\r\nBy and by it occurred to him to sit inside the log instead of on it, so\r\nhe hollowed it out with fire or flint. Later, much later, he constructed\r\nan ocean liner.\r\n\r\nCain, or whoever it was first slew his brother man, made use of a stone\r\nor stick. Afterward it was found a better weapon could be made by tying\r\nthe stone to the end of the stick, and as murder developed into a fine\r\nart the stick was converted into the bow and this into the catapult and\r\nfinally into the cannon, while the stone was developed into the high\r\nexplosive projectile. The first music to soothe the savage breast was\r\nthe soughing of the wind through the trees. Then strings were stretched\r\nacross a crevice for the wind to play upon and there was the Æolian\r\nharp. The second stage was entered when Hermes strung the tortoise shell\r\nand plucked it with his fingers and when Athena, raising the wind from\r\nher own lungs, forced it through a hollow reed. From these beginnings we\r\nhave the organ and the orchestra, producing such sounds as nothing in\r\nnature can equal.\r\n\r\nThe first idol was doubtless a meteorite fallen from heaven or a\r\nfulgurite or concretion picked up from the sand, bearing some slight\r\nresemblance to a human being. Later man made gods in his own image, and\r\nso sculpture and painting grew until now the creations of futuristic art\r\ncould be worshiped--if one wanted to--without violation of the second\r\ncommandment, for they are not the likeness of anything that is in heaven\r\nabove or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn the textile industry the same development is observable. The\r\nprimitive man used the skins of animals he had slain to protect his own\r\nskin. In the course of time he--or more probably his wife, for it is to\r\nthe women rather than to the men that we owe the early steps in the arts\r\nand sciences--fastened leaves together or pounded out bark to make\r\ngarments. Later fibers were plucked from the sheepskin, the cocoon and\r\nthe cotton-ball, twisted together and woven into cloth. Nowadays it is\r\npossible to make a complete suit of clothes, from hat to shoes, of any\r\ndesirable texture, form and color, and not include any substance to be\r\nfound in nature. The first metals available were those found free in\r\nnature such as gold and copper. In a later age it was found possible to\r\nextract iron from its ores and today we have artificial alloys made of\r\nmultifarious combinations of rare metals. The medicine man dosed his\r\npatients with decoctions of such roots and herbs as had a bad taste or\r\nqueer look. The pharmacist discovered how to extract from these their\r\nmedicinal principle such as morphine, quinine and cocaine, and the\r\ncreative chemist has discovered how to make innumerable drugs adapted to\r\nspecific diseases and individual idiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nIn the later or creative stages we enter the domain of chemistry, for it\r\nis the chemist alone who possesses the power of reducing a substance to\r\nits constituent atoms and from them producing substances entirely new.\r\nBut the chemist has been slow to realize his unique power and the world\r\nhas been still slower to utilize his invaluable services. Until recently\r\nindeed the leaders of chemical science expressly disclaimed what should\r\nhave been their proudest boast. The French chemist Lavoisier in 1793\r\ndefined chemistry as \"the science of analysis.\" The German chemist\r\nGerhardt in 1844 said: \"I have demonstrated that the chemist works in\r\nopposition to living nature, that he burns, destroys, analyzes, that the\r\nvital force alone operates by synthesis, that it reconstructs the\r\nedifice torn down by the chemical forces.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that chemists up to the middle of the last century were\r\nso absorbed in the destructive side of their science that they were\r\nblind to the constructive side of it. In this respect they were less\r\nprescient than their contemned predecessors, the alchemists, who,\r\nfoolish and pretentious as they were, aspired at least to the formation\r\nof something new.\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, the French chemist Berthelot who first clearly\r\nperceived the double aspect of chemistry, for he defined it as \"the\r\nscience of analysis _and synthesis_,\" of taking apart and of putting\r\ntogether. The motto of chemistry, as of all the empirical sciences, is\r\n_savoir c'est pouvoir_, to know in order to do. This is the pragmatic\r\ntest of all useful knowledge. Berthelot goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     Chemistry creates its object. This creative faculty, comparable\r\n     to that of art itself, distinguishes it essentially from the\r\n     natural and historical sciences.... These sciences do not\r\n     control their object. Thus they are too often condemned to an\r\n     eternal impotence in the search for truth of which they must\r\n     content themselves with possessing some few and often uncertain\r\n     fragments. On the contrary, the experimental sciences have the\r\n     power to realize their conjectures.... What they dream of that\r\n     they can manifest in actuality....\r\n\r\n     Chemistry possesses this creative faculty to a more eminent\r\n     degree than the other sciences because it penetrates more\r\n     profoundly and attains even to the natural elements of\r\n     existences.\r\n\r\nSince Berthelot's time, that is, within the last fifty years, chemistry\r\nhas won its chief triumphs in the field of synthesis. Organic chemistry,\r\nthat is, the chemistry of the carbon compounds, so called because it was\r\nformerly assumed, as Gerhardt says, that they could only be formed by\r\n\"vital force\" of organized plants and animals, has taken a development\r\nfar overshadowing inorganic chemistry, or the chemistry of mineral\r\nsubstances. Chemists have prepared or know how to prepare hundreds of\r\nthousands of such \"organic compounds,\" few of which occur in the natural\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut this conception of chemistry is yet far from having been accepted by\r\nthe world at large. This was brought forcibly to my attention during the\r\npublication of these chapters in \"The Independent\" by various letters,\r\nraising such objections as the following:\r\n\r\n     When you say in your article on \"What Comes from Coal Tar\" that\r\n     \"Art can go ahead of nature in the dyestuff business\" you have\r\n     doubtless for the moment allowed your enthusiasm to sweep you\r\n     away from the moorings of reason. Shakespeare, anticipating you\r\n     and your \"Creative Chemistry,\" has shown the utter\r\n     untenableness of your position:\r\n\r\n            Nature is made better by no mean,\r\n            But nature makes that mean: so o'er that art,\r\n            Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art\r\n            That nature makes.\r\n\r\n     How can you say that art surpasses nature when you know very\r\n     well that nothing man is able to make can in any way equal the\r\n     perfection of all nature's products?\r\n\r\n     It is blasphemous of you to claim that man can improve the\r\n     works of God as they appear in nature. Only the Creator can\r\n     create. Man only imitates, destroys or defiles God's handiwork.\r\n\r\nNo, it was not in momentary absence of mind that I claimed that man\r\ncould improve upon nature in the making of dyes. I not only said it, but\r\nI proved it. I not only proved it, but I can back it up. I will give a\r\nmillion dollars to anybody finding in nature dyestuffs as numerous,\r\nvaried, brilliant, pure and cheap as those that are manufactured in the\r\nlaboratory. I haven't that amount of money with me at the moment, but\r\nthe dyers would be glad to put it up for the discovery of a satisfactory\r\nnatural source for their tinctorial materials. This is not an opinion of\r\nmine but a matter of fact, not to be decided by Shakespeare, who was not\r\nacquainted with the aniline products.\r\n\r\nShakespeare in the passage quoted is indulging in his favorite amusement\r\nof a play upon words. There is a possible and a proper sense of the word\r\n\"nature\" that makes it include everything except the supernatural.\r\nTherefore man and all his works belong to the realm of nature. A\r\ntenement house in this sense is as \"natural\" as a bird's nest, a peapod\r\nor a crystal.\r\n\r\nBut such a wide extension of the term destroys its distinctive value. It\r\nis more convenient and quite as correct to use \"nature\" as I have used\r\nit, in contradistinction to \"art,\" meaning by the former the products of\r\nthe mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, excluding the designs,\r\ninventions and constructions of man which we call \"art.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot, in a general and abstract fashion, say which is superior, art\r\nor nature, because it all depends on the point of view. The worm loves a\r\nrotten log into which he can bore. Man prefers a steel cabinet into\r\nwhich the worm cannot bore. If man cannot improve Upon nature he has no\r\nmotive for making anything. Artificial products are therefore superior\r\nto natural products as measured by man's convenience, otherwise they\r\nwould have no reason for existence.\r\n\r\nScience and Christianity are at one in abhorring the natural man and\r\ncalling upon the civilized man to fight and subdue him. The conquest of\r\nnature, not the imitation of nature, is the whole duty of man.\r\nMetchnikoff and St. Paul unite in criticizing the body we were born\r\nwith. St. Augustine and Huxley are in agreement as to the eternal\r\nconflict between man and nature. In his Romanes lecture on \"Evolution\r\nand Ethics\" Huxley said: \"The ethical progress of society depends, not\r\non imitating the cosmic process, still less on running away from it, but\r\non combating it,\" and again: \"The history of civilization details the\r\nsteps by which man has succeeded in building up an artificial world\r\nwithin the cosmos.\"\r\n\r\nThere speaks the true evolutionist, whose one desire is to get away from\r\nnature as fast and far as possible. Imitate Nature? Yes, when we cannot\r\nimprove upon her. Admire Nature? Possibly, but be not blinded to her\r\ndefects. Learn from Nature? We should sit humbly at her feet until we\r\ncan stand erect and go our own way. Love Nature? Never! She is our\r\ntreacherous and unsleeping foe, ever to be feared and watched and\r\ncircumvented, for at any moment and in spite of all our vigilance she\r\nmay wipe out the human race by famine, pestilence or earthquake and\r\nwithin a few centuries obliterate every trace of its achievement. The\r\nwild beasts that man has kept at bay for a few centuries will in the end\r\ninvade his palaces: the moss will envelop his walls and the lichen\r\ndisrupt them. The clam may survive man by as many millennia as it\r\npreceded him. In the ultimate devolution of the world animal life will\r\ndisappear before vegetable, the higher plants will be killed off before\r\nthe lower, and finally the three kingdoms of nature will be reduced to\r\none, the mineral. Civilized man, enthroned in his citadel and defended\r\nby all the forces of nature that he has brought under his control, is\r\nafter all in the same situation as a savage, shivering in the darkness\r\nbeside his fire, listening to the pad of predatory feet, the rustle of\r\nserpents and the cry of birds of prey, knowing that only the fire keeps\r\nhis enemies off, but knowing too that every stick he lays on the fire\r\nlessens his fuel supply and hastens the inevitable time when the beasts\r\nof the jungle will make their fatal rush.\r\n\r\nChaos is the \"natural\" state of the universe. Cosmos is the rare and\r\ntemporary exception. Of all the million spheres this is apparently the\r\nonly one habitable and of this only a small part--the reader may draw\r\nthe boundaries to suit himself--can be called civilized. Anarchy is the\r\nnatural state of the human race. It prevailed exclusively all over the\r\nworld up to some five thousand years ago, since which a few peoples have\r\nfor a time succeeded in establishing a certain degree of peace and\r\norder. This, however, can be maintained only by strenuous and persistent\r\nefforts, for society tends naturally to sink into the chaos out of which\r\nit has arisen.\r\n\r\nIt is only by overcoming nature that man can rise. The sole salvation\r\nfor the human race lies in the removal of the primal curse, the sentence\r\nof hard labor for life that was imposed on man as he left Paradise. Some\r\nfolks are trying to elevate the laboring classes; some are trying to\r\nkeep them down. The scientist has a more radical remedy; he wants to\r\nannihilate the laboring classes by abolishing labor. There is no longer\r\nany need for human labor in the sense of personal toil, for the physical\r\nenergy necessary to accomplish all kinds of work may be obtained from\r\nexternal sources and it can be directed and controlled without extreme\r\nexertion. Man's first effort in this direction was to throw part of his\r\nburden upon the horse and ox or upon other men. But within the last\r\ncentury it has been discovered that neither human nor animal servitude\r\nis necessary to give man leisure for the higher life, for by means of\r\nthe machine he can do the work of giants without exhaustion. But the\r\nintroduction of machines, like every other step of human progress, met\r\nwith the most violent opposition from those it was to benefit. \"Smash\r\n'em!\" cried the workingman. \"Smash 'em!\" cried the poet. \"Smash 'em!\"\r\ncried the artist. \"Smash 'em!\" cried the theologian. \"Smash 'em!\" cried\r\nthe magistrate. This opposition yet lingers and every new invention,\r\nespecially in chemistry, is greeted with general distrust and often with\r\nlegislative prohibition.\r\n\r\nMan is the tool-using animal, and the machine, that is, the power-driven\r\ntool, is his peculiar achievement. It is purely a creation of the human\r\nmind. The wheel, its essential feature, does not exist in nature. The\r\nlever, with its to-and-fro motion, we find in the limbs of all animals,\r\nbut the continuous and revolving lever, the wheel, cannot be formed of\r\nbone and flesh. Man as a motive power is a poor thing. He can only\r\nconvert three or four thousand calories of energy a day and he does that\r\nvery inefficiently. But he can make an engine that will handle a hundred\r\nthousand times that, twice as efficiently and three times as long. In\r\nthis way only can he get rid of pain and toil and gain the wealth he\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nGradually then he will substitute for the natural world an artificial\r\nworld, molded nearer to his heart's desire. Man the Artifex will\r\nultimately master Nature and reign supreme over his own creation until\r\nchaos shall come again. In the ancient drama it was _deus ex machina_\r\nthat came in at the end to solve the problems of the play. It is to the\r\nsame supernatural agency, the divinity in machinery, that we must look\r\nfor the salvation of society. It is by means of applied science that the\r\nearth can be made habitable and a decent human life made possible.\r\nCreative evolution is at last becoming conscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNITROGEN\r\n\r\nPRESERVER AND DESTROYER OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the chemist the Great War was essentially a series of\r\nexplosive reactions resulting in the liberation of nitrogen. Nothing\r\nlike it has been seen in any previous wars. The first battles were\r\nfought with cellulose, mostly in the form of clubs. The next were fought\r\nwith silica, mostly in the form of flint arrowheads and spear-points.\r\nThen came the metals, bronze to begin with and later iron. The\r\nnitrogenous era in warfare began when Friar Roger Bacon or Friar\r\nSchwartz--whichever it was--ground together in his mortar saltpeter,\r\ncharcoal and sulfur. The Chinese, to be sure, had invented gunpowder\r\nlong before, but they--poor innocents--did not know of anything worse to\r\ndo with it than to make it into fire-crackers. With the introduction of\r\n\"villainous saltpeter\" war ceased to be the vocation of the nobleman and\r\nsince the nobleman had no other vocation he began to become extinct. A\r\nbullet fired from a mile away is no respecter of persons. It is just as\r\nlikely to kill a knight as a peasant, and a brave man as a coward. You\r\ncannot fence with a cannon ball nor overawe it with a plumed hat. The\r\nonly thing you can do is to hide and shoot back. Now you cannot hide if\r\nyou send up a column of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night--the\r\nmost conspicuous of signals--every time you shoot. So the next step was\r\nthe invention of a smokeless powder. In this the oxygen necessary for\r\nthe combustion is already in such close combination with its fuel, the\r\ncarbon and hydrogen, that no black particles of carbon can get away\r\nunburnt. In the old-fashioned gunpowder the oxygen necessary for the\r\ncombustion of the carbon and sulfur was in a separate package, in the\r\nmolecule of potassium nitrate, and however finely the mixture was\r\nground, some of the atoms, in the excitement of the explosion, failed to\r\nfind their proper partners at the moment of dispersal. The new gunpowder\r\nbesides being smokeless is ashless. There is no black sticky mass of\r\npotassium salts left to foul the gun barrel.\r\n\r\nThe gunpowder period of warfare was actively initiated at the battle of\r\nCressy, in which, as a contemporary historian says, \"The English guns\r\nmade noise like thunder and caused much loss in men and horses.\"\r\nSmokeless powder as invented by Paul Vieille was adopted by the French\r\nGovernment in 1887. This, then, might be called the beginning of the\r\nguncotton or nitrocellulose period--or, perhaps in deference to the\r\ncaveman's club, the second cellulose period of human warfare. Better,\r\ndoubtless, to call it the \"high explosive period,\" for various other\r\nnitro-compounds besides guncotton are being used.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to note is that all the explosives from gunpowder\r\ndown contain nitrogen as the essential element. It is customary to call\r\nnitrogen \"an inert element\" because it was hard to get it into\r\ncombination with other elements. It might, on the other hand, be looked\r\nupon as an active element because it acts so energetically in getting\r\nout of its compounds. We can dodge the question by saying that nitrogen\r\nis a most unreliable and unsociable element. Like Kipling's cat it walks\r\nby its wild lone.\r\n\r\nIt is not so bad as Argon the Lazy and the other celibate gases of that\r\nfamily, where each individual atom goes off by itself and absolutely\r\nrefuses to unite even temporarily with any other atom. The nitrogen\r\natoms will pair off with each other and stick together, but they are\r\nreluctant to associate with other elements and when they do the\r\ncombination is likely to break up any moment. You all know people like\r\nthat, good enough when by themselves but sure to break up any club,\r\nchurch or society they get into. Now, the value of nitrogen in warfare\r\nis due to the fact that all the atoms desert in a body on the field of\r\nbattle. Millions of them may be lying packed in a gun cartridge, as\r\nquiet as you please, but let a little disturbance start in the\r\nneighborhood--say a grain of mercury fulminate flares up--and all the\r\nnitrogen atoms get to trembling so violently that they cannot be\r\nrestrained. The shock spreads rapidly through the whole mass. The\r\nhydrogen and carbon atoms catch up the oxygen and in an instant they are\r\noff on a stampede, crowding in every direction to find an exit, and\r\ngetting more heated up all the time. The only movable side is the cannon\r\nball in front, so they all pound against that and give it such a shove\r\nthat it goes ten miles before it stops. The external bombardment by the\r\ncannon ball is, therefore, preceded by an internal bombardment on the\r\ncannon ball by the molecules of the hot gases, whose speed is about as\r\ngreat as the speed of the projectile that they propel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © Underwood & Underwood\r\n\r\nTHE HAND GRENADES WHICH THESE WOMEN ARE BORING will contain potential\r\nchemical energy capable of causing a vast amount of destruction when\r\nreleased. During the war the American Government placed orders for\r\n68,000,000 such grenades as are here shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © International Film Service, Inc.\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN A MUNITION PLANT ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF\r\nTRI-NITRO-TOLUOL, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF MODERN HIGH EXPLOSIVES]\r\n\r\nThe active agent in all these explosives is the nitrogen atom in\r\ncombination with two oxygen atoms, which the chemist calls the \"nitro\r\ngroup\" and which he represents by NO_{2}. This group was, as I have\r\nsaid, originally used in the form of saltpeter or potassium nitrate, but\r\nsince the chemist did not want the potassium part of it--for it fouled\r\nhis guns--he took the nitro group out of the nitrate by means of\r\nsulfuric acid and by the same means hooked it on to some compound of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen that would burn without leaving any residue, and\r\ngive nothing but gases. One of the simplest of these hydrocarbon\r\nderivatives is glycerin, the same as you use for sunburn. This mixed\r\nwith nitric and sulfuric acids gives nitroglycerin, an easy thing to\r\nmake, though I should not advise anybody to try making it unless he has\r\nhis life insured. But nitroglycerin is uncertain stuff to keep and being\r\na liquid is awkward to handle. So it was mixed with sawdust or porous\r\nearth or something else that would soak it up. This molded into sticks\r\nis our ordinary dynamite.\r\n\r\nIf instead of glycerin we take cellulose in the form of wood pulp or\r\ncotton and treat this with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric we\r\nget nitrocellulose or guncotton, which is the chief ingredient of\r\nsmokeless powder.\r\n\r\nNow guncotton looks like common cotton. It is too light and loose to\r\npack well into a gun. So it is dissolved with ether and alcohol or\r\nacetone to make a plastic mass that can be molded into rods and cut into\r\ngrains of suitable shape and size to burn at the proper speed.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a liquid explosive, nitroglycerin, that has to be\r\nsoaked up in some porous solid, and a porous solid, guncotton, that has\r\nto soak up some liquid. Why not solve both difficulties together by\r\ndissolving the guncotton in the nitroglycerin and so get a double\r\nexplosive? This is a simple idea. Any of us can see the sense of\r\nit--once it is suggested to us. But Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist,\r\nwho thought it out first in 1878, made millions out of it. Then,\r\napparently alarmed at the possible consequences of his invention, he\r\nbequeathed the fortune he had made by it to found international prizes\r\nfor medical, chemical and physical discoveries, idealistic literature\r\nand the promotion of peace. But his posthumous efforts for the\r\nadvancement of civilization and the abolition of war did not amount to\r\nmuch and his high explosives were later employed to blow into pieces the\r\ndoctors, chemists, authors and pacifists he wished to reward.\r\n\r\nNobel's invention, \"cordite,\" is composed of nitroglycerin and\r\nnitrocellulose with a little mineral jelly or vaseline. Besides cordite\r\nand similar mixtures of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose there are two\r\nother classes of high explosives in common use.\r\n\r\nOne is made from carbolic acid, which is familiar to us all by its use\r\nas a disinfectant. If this is treated with nitric and sulfuric acids we\r\nget from it picric acid, a yellow crystalline solid. Every government\r\nhas its own secret formula for this type of explosive. The British call\r\ntheirs \"lyddite,\" the French \"melinite\" and the Japanese \"shimose.\"\r\n\r\nThe third kind of high explosives uses as its base toluol. This is not\r\nso familiar to us as glycerin, cotton or carbolic acid. It is one of the\r\ncoal tar products, an inflammable liquid, resembling benzene. When\r\ntreated with nitric acid in the usual way it takes up like the others\r\nthree nitro groups and so becomes tri-nitro-toluol. Realizing that\r\npeople could not be expected to use such a mouthful of a word, the\r\nchemists have suggested various pretty nicknames, trotyl, tritol,\r\ntrinol, tolite and trilit, but the public, with the wilfulness it always\r\nshows in the matter of names, persists in calling it TNT, as though it\r\nwere an author like G.B.S., or G.K.C, or F.P.A. TNT is the latest of\r\nthese high explosives and in some ways the best of them. Picric acid has\r\nthe bad habit of attacking the metals with which it rests in contact\r\nforming sensitive picrates that are easily set off, but TNT is inert\r\ntoward metals and keeps well. TNT melts far below the boiling point of\r\nwater so can be readily liquefied and poured into shells. It is\r\ninsensitive to ordinary shocks. A rifle bullet can be fired through a\r\ncase of it without setting it off, and if lighted with a match it burns\r\nquietly. The amazing thing about these modern explosives, the organic\r\nnitrates, is the way they will stand banging about and burning, yet the\r\nterrific violence with which they blow up when shaken by an explosive\r\nwave of a particular velocity like that of a fulminating cap. Like\r\npicric acid, TNT stains the skin yellow and causes soreness and\r\nsometimes serious cases of poisoning among the employees, mostly girls,\r\nin the munition factories. On the other hand, the girls working with\r\ncordite get to using it as chewing gum; a harmful habit, not because of\r\nany danger of being blown up by it, but because nitroglycerin is a heart\r\nstimulant and they do not need that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Genealogical Tree of Nitric Acid From W.Q. Whitman's\r\n\"The Story of Nitrates in the War,\" _General Science Quarterly_]\r\n\r\nTNT is by no means smokeless. The German shells that exploded with a\r\ncloud of black smoke and which British soldiers called \"Black Marias,\"\r\n\"coal-boxes\" or \"Jack Johnsons\" were loaded with it. But it is an\r\nadvantage to have a shell show where it strikes, although a disadvantage\r\nto have it show where it starts.\r\n\r\nIt is these high explosives that have revolutionized warfare. As soon as\r\nthe first German shell packed with these new nitrates burst inside the\r\nGruson cupola at Liège and tore out its steel and concrete by the roots\r\nthe world knew that the day of the fixed fortress was gone. The armies\r\ndeserted their expensively prepared fortifications and took to the\r\ntrenches. The British troops in France found their weapons futile and\r\nsent across the Channel the cry of \"Send us high explosives or we\r\nperish!\" The home Government was slow to heed the appeal, but no\r\nprogress was made against the Germans until the Allies had the means to\r\nblast them out of their entrenchments by shells loaded with five hundred\r\npounds of TNT.\r\n\r\nAll these explosives are made from nitric acid and this used to be made\r\nfrom nitrates such as potassium nitrate or saltpeter. But nitrates are\r\nrarely found in large quantities. Napoleon and Lee had a hard time to\r\nscrape up enough saltpeter from the compost heaps, cellars and caves for\r\ntheir gunpowder, and they did not use as much nitrogen in a whole\r\ncampaign as was freed in a few days' cannonading on the Somme. Now there\r\nis one place in the world--and so far as we know one only--where\r\nnitrates are to be found abundantly. This is in a desert on the western\r\nslope of the Andes where ancient guano deposits have decomposed and\r\nthere was not enough rain to wash away their salts. Here is a bed two\r\nmiles wide, two hundred miles long and five feet deep yielding some\r\ntwenty to fifty per cent. of sodium nitrate. The deposit originally\r\nbelonged to Peru, but Chile fought her for it and got it in 1881. Here\r\nall countries came to get their nitrates for agriculture and powder\r\nmaking. Germany was the largest customer and imported 750,000 tons of\r\nChilean nitrate in 1913, besides using 100,000 tons of other nitrogen\r\nsalts. By this means her old, wornout fields were made to yield greater\r\nharvests than our fresh land. Germany and England were like two duelists\r\nbuying powder at the same shop. The Chilean Government, pocketing an\r\nexport duty that aggregated half a billion dollars, permitted the\r\nsaltpeter to be shoveled impartially into British and German ships, and\r\nso two nitrogen atoms, torn from their Pacific home and parted, like\r\nEvangeline and Gabriel, by transportation oversea, may have found\r\nthemselves flung into each other's arms from the mouths of opposing\r\nhowitzers in the air of Flanders. Goethe could write a romance on such a\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nNow the moment war broke out this source of supply was shut off to both\r\nparties, for they blockaded each other. The British fleet closed up the\r\nGerman ports while the German cruisers in the Pacific took up a position\r\noff the coast of Chile in order to intercept the ships carrying nitrates\r\nto England and France. The Panama Canal, designed to afford relief in\r\nsuch an emergency, caved in most inopportunely. The British sent a fleet\r\nto the Pacific to clear the nitrate route, but it was outranged and\r\ndefeated on November 1, 1914. Then a stronger British fleet was sent\r\nout and smashed the Germans off the Falkland Islands on December 8. But\r\nfor seven weeks the nitrate route had been closed while the chemical\r\nreactions on the Marne and Yser were decomposing nitrogen-compounds at\r\nan unheard of rate.\r\n\r\nEngland was now free to get nitrates for her munition factories, but\r\nGermany was still bottled up. She had stored up Chilean nitrates in\r\nanticipation of the war and as soon as it was seen to be coming she\r\nbought all she could get in Europe. But this supply was altogether\r\ninadequate and the war would have come to an end in the first winter if\r\nGerman chemists had not provided for such a contingency in advance by\r\nworking out methods of getting nitrogen from the air. Long ago it was\r\nsaid that the British ruled the sea and the French the land so that left\r\nnothing to the German but the air. The Germans seem to have taken this\r\njibe seriously and to have set themselves to make the most of the aerial\r\nrealm in order to challenge the British and French in the fields they\r\nhad appropriated. They had succeeded so far that the Kaiser when he\r\ndeclared war might well have considered himself the Prince of the Power\r\nof the Air. He had a fleet of Zeppelins and he had means for the\r\nfixation of nitrogen such as no other nation possessed. The Zeppelins\r\nburst like wind bags, but the nitrogen plants worked and made Germany\r\nindependent of Chile not only during the war, but in the time of peace.\r\n\r\nGermany during the war used 200,000 tons of nitric acid a year in\r\nexplosives, yet her supply of nitrogen is exhaustless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: World production and consumption of fixed inorganic\r\nnitrogen expressed in tons nitrogen\r\n\r\nFrom _The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_, March,\r\n1919.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNitrogen is free as air. That is the trouble; it is too free. It is\r\nfixed nitrogen that we want and that we are willing to pay for; nitrogen\r\nin combination with some other elements in the form of food or\r\nfertilizer so we can make use of it as we set it free. Fixed nitrogen in\r\nits cheapest form, Chile saltpeter, rose to $250 during the war. Free\r\nnitrogen costs nothing and is good for nothing. If a land-owner has a\r\nright to an expanding pyramid of air above him to the limits of the\r\natmosphere--as, I believe, the courts have decided in the eaves-dropping\r\ncases--then for every square foot of his ground he owns as much\r\nnitrogen as he could buy for $2500. The air is four-fifths free nitrogen\r\nand if we could absorb it in our lungs as we do the oxygen of the other\r\nfifth a few minutes breathing would give us a full meal. But we let this\r\nfree nitrogen all out again through our noses and then go and pay 35\r\ncents a pound for steak or 60 cents a dozen for eggs in order to get\r\nenough combined nitrogen to live on. Though man is immersed in an ocean\r\nof nitrogen, yet he cannot make use of it. He is like Coleridge's\r\n\"Ancient Mariner\" with \"water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nNitrogen is, as Hood said not so truly about gold, \"hard to get and hard\r\nto hold.\" The bacteria that form the nodules on the roots of peas and\r\nbeans have the power that man has not of utilizing free nitrogen.\r\nInstead of this quiet inconspicuous process man has to call upon the\r\nlightning when he wants to fix nitrogen. The air contains the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen which it is desired to combine to form nitrates but the atoms\r\nare paired, like to like. Passing an electric spark through the air\r\nbreaks up some of these pairs and in the confusion of the shock the\r\nlonely atoms seize on their nearest neighbor and so may get partners of\r\nthe other sort. I have seen this same thing happen in a square dance\r\nwhere somebody made a blunder. It is easy to understand the reaction if\r\nwe represent the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen by the initials of their\r\nnames in this fashion:\r\n\r\n      NN  +  OO   -->   NO + NO\r\n  nitrogen  oxygen    nitric oxide\r\n\r\nThe --> represents Jove's thunderbolt, a stroke of artificial\r\nlightning. We see on the left the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen,\r\nbefore taking the electric treatment, as separate elemental pairs, and\r\nthen to the right of the arrow we find them as compound molecules of\r\nnitric oxide. This takes up another atom of oxygen from the air and\r\nbecomes NOO, or using a subscript figure to indicate the number of atoms\r\nand so avoid repeating the letter, NO_{2} which is the familiar nitro\r\ngroup of nitric acid (HO--NO_{2}) and of its salts, the nitrates, and of\r\nits organic compounds, the high explosives. The NO_{2} is a brown and\r\nevil-smelling gas which when dissolved in water (HOH) and further\r\noxidized is completely converted into nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus which effects this transformation is essentially a\r\ngigantic arc light in a chimney through which a current of hot air is\r\nblown. The more thoroughly the air comes under the action of the\r\nelectric arc the more molecules of nitrogen and oxygen will be broken up\r\nand rearranged, but on the other hand if the mixture of gases remains in\r\nthe path of the discharge the NO molecules are also broken up and go\r\nback into their original form of NN and OO. So the object is to spread\r\nout the electric arc as widely as possible and then run the air through\r\nit rapidly. In the Schönherr process the electric arc is a spiral flame\r\ntwenty-three feet long through which the air streams with a vortex\r\nmotion. In the Birkeland-Eyde furnace there is a series of semi-circular\r\narcs spread out by the repellent force of a powerful electric magnet in\r\na flaming disc seven feet in diameter with a temperature of 6300° F. In\r\nthe Pauling furnace the electrodes between which the current strikes\r\nare two cast iron tubes curving upward and outward like the horns of a\r\nTexas steer and cooled by a stream of water passing through them. These\r\nelectric furnaces produce two or three ounces of nitric acid for each\r\nkilowatt-hour of current consumed. Whether they can compete with the\r\nnatural nitrates and the products of other processes depends upon how\r\ncheaply they can get their electricity. Before the war there were\r\nseveral large installations in Norway and elsewhere where abundant water\r\npower was available and now the Norwegians are using half a million\r\nhorse power continuously in the fixation of nitrogen and the rest of the\r\nworld as much again. The Germans had invested largely in these foreign\r\noxidation plants, but shortly before the war they had sold out and\r\nturned their attention to other processes not requiring so much\r\nelectrical energy, for their country is poorly provided with water\r\npower. The Haber process, that they made most of, is based upon as\r\nsimple a reaction as that we have been considering, for it consists in\r\nuniting two elemental gases to make a compound, but the elements in this\r\ncase are not nitrogen and oxygen, but nitrogen and hydrogen. This gives\r\nammonia instead of nitric acid, but ammonia is useful for its own\r\npurposes and it can be converted into nitric acid if this is desired.\r\nThe reaction is:\r\n\r\n  NN   +   HH + HH + HH --> NHHH + NHHH\r\n  Nitrogen  hydrogen         ammonia\r\n\r\nThe animals go in two by two, but they come out four by four. Four\r\nmolecules of the mixed elements are turned into two molecules and so the\r\ngas shrinks to half its volume. At the same time it acquires an\r\nodor--familiar to us when we are curing a cold--that neither of the\r\noriginal gases had. The agent that effects the transformation in this\r\ncase is not the electric spark--for this would tend to work the reaction\r\nbackwards--but uranium, a rare metal, which has the peculiar property of\r\nhelping along a reaction while seeming to take no part in it. Such a\r\nsubstance is called a catalyst. The action of a catalyst is rather\r\nmysterious and whenever we have a mystery we need an analogy. We may,\r\nthen, compare the catalyst to what is known as \"a good mixer\" in\r\nsociety. You know the sort of man I mean. He may not be brilliant or\r\nespecially talkative, but somehow there is always \"something doing\" at a\r\npicnic or house-party when he is along. The tactful hostess, the salon\r\nleader, is a social catalyst. The trouble with catalysts, either human\r\nor metallic, is that they are rare and that sometimes they get sulky and\r\nwon't work if the ingredients they are supposed to mix are unsuitable.\r\n\r\nBut the uranium, osmium, platinum or whatever metal is used as a\r\ncatalyzing agent is expensive and although it is not used up it is\r\neasily \"poisoned,\" as the chemists say, by impurities in the gases. The\r\nnitrogen and the hydrogen for the Haber process must then be prepared\r\nand purified before trying to combine them into ammonia. The nitrogen is\r\nobtained by liquefying air by cold and pressure and then boiling off the\r\nnitrogen at 194° C. The oxygen left is useful for other purposes. The\r\nhydrogen needed is extracted by a similar process of fractional\r\ndistillation from \"water-gas,\" the blue-flame burning gas used for\r\nheating. Then the nitrogen and hydrogen, mixed in the proportion of one\r\nto three, as shown in the reaction given above, are compressed to two\r\nhundred atmospheres, heated to 1300° F. and passed over the finely\r\ndivided uranium. The stream of gas that comes out contains about four\r\nper cent. of ammonia, which is condensed to a liquid by cooling and the\r\nuncombined hydrogen and nitrogen passed again through the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia can be employed in refrigeration and other ways but if it is\r\ndesired to get the nitrogen into the form of nitric acid it has to be\r\noxidized by the so-called Ostwald process. This is the reaction:\r\n\r\n  NH_{3}  +  4O   -->   HNO_{3} + H_{2}O\r\n  ammonia  oxygen    nitric acid  water\r\n\r\nThe catalyst used to effect this combination is the metal platinum in\r\nthe form of fine wire gauze, since the action takes place only on the\r\nsurface. The ammonia gas is mixed with air which supplies the oxygen and\r\nthe heated mixture run through the platinum gauze at the rate of several\r\nyards a second. Although the gases come in contact with the platinum\r\nonly a five-hundredth part of a second yet eighty-five per cent. is\r\nconverted into nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe Haber process for the making of ammonia by direct synthesis from its\r\nconstituent elements and the supplemental Ostwald process for the\r\nconversion of the ammonia into nitric acid were the salvation of\r\nGermany. As soon as the Germans saw that their dash toward Paris had\r\nbeen stopped at the Marne they knew that they were in for a long war and\r\nat once made plans for a supply of fixed nitrogen. The chief German dye\r\nfactories, the Badische Anilin and Soda-Fabrik, promptly put\r\n$100,000,000 into enlarging its plant and raised its production of\r\nammonium sulfate from 30,000 to 300,000 tons. One German electrical firm\r\nwith aid from the city of Berlin contracted to provide 66,000,000 pounds\r\nof fixed nitrogen a year at a cost of three cents a pound for the next\r\ntwenty-five years. The 750,000 tons of Chilean nitrate imported annually\r\nby Germany contained about 116,000 tons of the essential element\r\nnitrogen. The fourteen large plants erected during the war can fix in\r\nthe form of nitrates 500,000 tons of nitrogen a year, which is more than\r\ntwice the amount needed for internal consumption. So Germany is now not\r\nonly independent of the outside world but will have a surplus of\r\nnitrogen products which could be sold even in America at about half what\r\nthe farmer has been paying for South American saltpeter.\r\n\r\nBesides the Haber or direct process there are other methods of making\r\nammonia which are, at least outside of Germany, of more importance. Most\r\nprominent of these is the cyanamid process. This requires electrical\r\npower since it starts with a product of the electrical furnace, calcium\r\ncarbide, familiar to us all as a source of acetylene gas.\r\n\r\nIf a stream of nitrogen is passed over hot calcium carbide it is taken\r\nup by the carbide according to the following equation:\r\n\r\n       CaC_{2}  +  N_{2}    -->    CaCN_{2}  +  C\r\n  calcium carbide nitrogen   calcium cyanamid  carbon\r\n\r\nCalcium cyanamid was discovered in 1895 by Caro and Franke when they\r\nwere trying to work out a new process for making cyanide to use in\r\nextracting gold. It looks like stone and, under the name of\r\nlime-nitrogen, or Kalkstickstoff, or nitrolim, is sold as a fertilizer.\r\nIf it is desired to get ammonia, it is treated with superheated steam.\r\nThe reaction produces heat and pressure, so it is necessary to carry it\r\non in stout autoclaves or enclosed kettles. The cyanamid is completely\r\nand quickly converted into pure ammonia and calcium carbonate, which is\r\nthe same as the limestone from which carbide was made. The reaction is:\r\n\r\n      CaCN_{2}  +  3H_{2}O   -->   CaCO_{3}  +  2NH_{3}\r\n  calcium cyanamid  water   calcium carbonate  ammonia\r\n\r\nAnother electrical furnace method, the Serpek process, uses aluminum\r\ninstead of calcium for the fixation of nitrogen. Bauxite, or impure\r\naluminum oxide, the ordinary mineral used in the manufacture of metallic\r\naluminum, is mixed with coal and heated in a revolving electrical\r\nfurnace through which nitrogen is passing. The equation is:\r\n\r\n  Al_{2}O_{3} + 3C + N_{2}   -->   2AlN  +  3CO\r\n  aluminum   carbon nitrogen    aluminum  carbon\r\n   oxide                         nitride   monoxide\r\n\r\nThen the aluminum nitride is treated with steam under pressure, which\r\nproduces ammonia and gives back the original aluminum oxide, but in a\r\npurer form than the mineral from which was made\r\n\r\n  2AlN  +  3H_{2}O --> 2NH_{3} + Al_{2}O_{3}\r\n  Aluminum  water     ammonia   aluminum oxide\r\n   nitride\r\n\r\nThe Serpek process is employed to some extent in France in connection\r\nwith the aluminum industry. These are the principal processes for the\r\nfixation of nitrogen now in use, but they by no means exhaust the\r\npossibilities. For instance, Professor John C. Bucher, of Brown\r\nUniversity, created a sensation in 1917 by announcing a new process\r\nwhich he had worked out with admirable completeness and which has some\r\nvery attractive features. It needs no electric power or high pressure\r\nretorts or liquid air apparatus. He simply fills a twenty-foot tube with\r\nbriquets made out of soda ash, iron and coke and passes producer gas\r\nthrough the heated tube. Producer gas contains nitrogen since it is made\r\nby passing air over hot coal. The reaction is:\r\n\r\n  2Na_{2}CO_{3} + 4C + N_{2}   =   2NaCN + 3CO\r\n  sodium       carbon  nitrogen    sodium   carbon\r\n   carbonate                        cyanide   monoxide\r\n\r\nThe iron here acts as the catalyst and converts two harmless substances,\r\nsodium carbonate, which is common washing soda, and carbon, into two of\r\nthe most deadly compounds known to man, cyanide and carbon monoxide,\r\nwhich is what kills you when you blow out the gas. Sodium cyanide is a\r\nsalt of hydrocyanic acid, which for, some curious reason is called\r\n\"Prussic acid.\" It is so violent a poison that, as the freshman said in\r\na chemistry recitation, \"a single drop of it placed on the tongue of a\r\ndog will kill a man.\"\r\n\r\nBut sodium cyanide is not only useful in itself, for the extraction of\r\ngold and cleaning of silver, but can be converted into ammonia, and a\r\nvariety of other compounds such as urea and oxamid, which are good\r\nfertilizers; sodium ferrocyanide, that makes Prussian blue; and oxalic\r\nacid used in dyeing. Professor Bucher claimed that his furnace could be\r\nset up in a day at a cost of less than $100 and could turn out 150\r\npounds of sodium cyanide in twenty-four hours. This process was placed\r\nfreely at the disposal of the United States Government for the war and a\r\n10-ton plant was built at Saltville, Va., by the Ordnance Department.\r\nBut the armistice put a stop to its operations and left the future of\r\nthe process undetermined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHEMICAL REACTION ON A LARGE SCALE\r\n\r\nFrom the chemist's standpoint modern warfare consists in the rapid\r\nliberation of nitrogen from its compounds]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co.\r\n\r\nBURNING AIR IN A BIRKELAND-EYDE FURNACE AT THE DU PONT PLANT\r\n\r\nAn electric arc consuming about 4000 horse-power of energy is passing\r\nbetween the U-shaped electrodes which are made of copper tube cooled by\r\nan internal current of water.

But little attention was paid to the\r\nnitrogen problem until 1916 when it became evident that we should soon\r\nbe drawn into a war \"with a first class power.\" On June 3, 1916,\r\nCongress placed $20,000,000 at the disposal of the president for\r\ninvestigation of \"the best, cheapest and most available means for the\r\nproduction of nitrate and other products for munitions of war and useful\r\nin the manufacture of fertilizers and other useful products by water\r\npower or any other power.\" But by the time war was declared on April 6,\r\n1917, no definite program had been approved and by the time the\r\narmistice was signed on November 11, 1918, no plants were in active\r\noperation. But five plants had been started and two of them were nearly\r\nready to begin work when they were closed by the ending of the war.\r\nUnited States Nitrate Plant No. 1 was located at Sheffield, Alabama, and\r\nwas designed for the production of ammonia by \"direct action\" from\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen according to the plans of the American Chemical\r\nCompany. Its capacity was calculated at 60,000 pounds of anhydrous\r\nammonia a day, half of which was to be oxidized to nitric acid. Plant\r\nNo. 2 was erected at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to use the process of the\r\nAmerican Cyanamid Company. This was contracted to produce 110,000 tons\r\nof ammonium nitrate a year and later two other cyanamid plants of half\r\nthat capacity were started at Toledo and Ancor, Ohio.\r\n\r\nAt Muscle Shoals a mushroom city of 20,000 sprang up on an Alabama\r\ncotton field in six months. The raw material, air, was as abundant there\r\nas anywhere and the power, water, could be obtained from the Government\r\nhydro-electric plant on the Tennessee River, but this was not available\r\nduring the war, so steam was employed instead. The heat of the coal was\r\nused to cool the air down to the liquefying point. The principle of this\r\nprocess is simple. Everybody knows that heat expands and cold contracts,\r\nbut not everybody has realized the converse of this rule, that expansion\r\ncools and compression heats. If air is forced into smaller space, as in\r\na tire pump, it heats up and if allowed to expand to ordinary pressure\r\nit cools off again. But if the air while compressed is cooled and then\r\nallowed to expand it must get still colder and the process can go on\r\ntill it becomes cold enough to congeal. That is, by expanding a great\r\ndeal of air, a little of it can be reduced to the liquefying point. At\r\nMuscle Shoals the plant for liquefying air, in order to get the nitrogen\r\nout of it, consisted of two dozen towers each capable of producing 1765\r\ncubic feet of pure nitrogen per hour. The air was drawn in through two\r\npipes, a yard across, and passed through scrubbing towers to remove\r\nimpurities. The air was then compressed to 600 pounds per square inch.\r\nNine tenths of the air was permitted to expand to 50 pounds and this\r\nexpansion cooled down the other tenth, still under high pressure, to the\r\nliquefying point. Rectifying towers 24 feet high were stacked with trays\r\nof liquid air from which the nitrogen was continually bubbling off since\r\nits boiling point is twelve degrees centigrade lower than that of\r\noxygen. Pure nitrogen gas collected at the top of the tower and the\r\nresidual liquid air, now about half oxygen, was allowed to escape at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen was then run through pipes into the lime-nitrogen ovens.\r\nThere were 1536 of these about four feet square and each holding 1600\r\npounds of pulverized calcium carbide. This is at first heated by an\r\nelectrical current to start the reaction which afterwards produces\r\nenough heat to keep it going. As the stream of nitrogen gas passes over\r\nthe finely divided carbide it is absorbed to form calcium cyanamid as\r\ndescribed on a previous page. This product is cooled, powdered and wet\r\nto destroy any quicklime or carbide left unchanged. Then it is charged\r\ninto autoclaves and steam at high temperature and pressure is admitted.\r\nThe steam acting on the cyanamid sets free ammonia gas which is carried\r\nto towers down which cold water is sprayed, giving the ammonia water,\r\nfamiliar to the kitchen and the bathroom.\r\n\r\nBut since nitric acid rather than ammonia was needed for munitions, the\r\noxygen of the air had to be called into play. This process, as already\r\nexplained, is carried on by aid of a catalyzer, in this case platinum\r\nwire. At Muscle Shoals there were 696 of these catalyzer boxes. The\r\nammonia gas, mixed with air to provide the necessary oxygen, was\r\nadmitted at the top and passed down through a sheet of platinum gauze of\r\n80 mesh to the inch, heated to incandescence by electricity. In contact\r\nwith this the ammonia is converted into gaseous oxides of nitrogen (the\r\nfamiliar red fumes of the laboratory) which, carried off in pipes,\r\ncooled and dissolved in water, form nitric acid.\r\n\r\nBut since none of the national plants could be got into action during\r\nthe war, the United States was compelled to draw upon South America for\r\nits supply. The imports of Chilean saltpeter rose from half a million\r\ntons in 1914 to a million and a half in 1917. After peace was made the\r\nDepartment of War turned over to the Department of Agriculture its\r\nsurplus of saltpeter, 150,000 tons, and it was sold to American farmers\r\nat cost, $81 a ton.\r\n\r\nFor nitrogen plays a double rôle in human economy. It appears like\r\nBrahma in two aspects, Vishnu the Preserver and Siva the Destroyer. Here\r\nI have been considering nitrogen in its maleficent aspect, its use in\r\nwar. We now turn to its beneficent aspect, its use in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFEEDING THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great War not only starved people: it starved the land. Enough\r\nnitrogen was thrown away in some indecisive battle on the Aisne to save\r\nIndia from a famine. The population of Europe as a whole has not been\r\nlessened by the war, but the soil has been robbed of its power to\r\nsupport the population. A plant requires certain chemical elements for\r\nits growth and all of these must be within reach of its rootlets, for it\r\nwill accept no substitutes. A wheat stalk in France before the war had\r\nplaced at its feet nitrates from Chile, phosphates from Florida and\r\npotash from Germany. All these were shut off by the firing line and the\r\nshortage of shipping.\r\n\r\nOut of the eighty elements only thirteen are necessary for crops. Four\r\nof these are gases: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine. Five are\r\nmetals: potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron and sodium. Four are\r\nnon-metallic solids: carbon, sulfur, phosphorus and silicon. Three of\r\nthese, hydrogen, oxygen and carbon, making up the bulk of the plant, are\r\nobtainable _ad libitum_ from the air and water. The other ten in the\r\nform of salts are dissolved in the water that is sucked up from the\r\nsoil. The quantity needed by the plant is so small and the quantity\r\ncontained in the soil is so great that ordinarily we need not bother\r\nabout the supply except in case of three of them. They are nitrogen,\r\npotassium and phosphorus. These would be useless or fatal to plant life\r\nin the elemental form, but fixed in neutral salt they are essential\r\nplant foods. A ton of wheat takes away from the soil about 47 pounds of\r\nnitrogen, 18 pounds of phosphoric acid and 12 pounds of potash. If then\r\nthe farmer does not restore this much to his field every year he is\r\ndrawing upon his capital and this must lead to bankruptcy in the long\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nSo much is easy to see, but actually the question is extremely\r\ncomplicated. When the German chemist, Justus von Liebig, pointed out in\r\n1840 the possibility of maintaining soil fertility by the application of\r\nchemicals it seemed at first as though the question were practically\r\nsolved. Chemists assumed that all they had to do was to analyze the soil\r\nand analyze the crop and from this figure out, as easily as balancing a\r\nbank book, just how much of each ingredient would have to be restored to\r\nthe soil every year. But somehow it did not work out that way and the\r\npractical agriculturist, finding that the formulas did not fit his farm,\r\nsneered at the professors and whenever they cited Liebig to him he\r\nirreverently transposed the syllables of the name. The chemist when he\r\nwent deeper into the subject saw that he had to deal with the colloids,\r\ndamp, unpleasant, gummy bodies that he had hitherto fought shy of\r\nbecause they would not crystallize or filter. So the chemist called to\r\nhis aid the physicist on the one hand and the biologist on the other and\r\nthen they both had their hands full. The physicist found that he had to\r\ndeal with a polyvariant system of solids, liquids and gases mutually\r\nmiscible in phases too numerous to be handled by Gibbs's Rule. The\r\nbiologist found that he had to deal with the invisible flora and fauna\r\nof a new world.\r\n\r\nPlants obey the injunction of Tennyson and rise on the stepping stones\r\nof their dead selves to higher things. Each successive generation lives\r\non what is left of the last in the soil plus what it adds from the air\r\nand sunshine. As soon as a leaf or tree trunk falls to the ground it is\r\ntaken in charge by a wrecking crew composed of a myriad of microscopic\r\norganisms who proceed to break it up into its component parts so these\r\ncan be used for building a new edifice. The process is called \"rotting\"\r\nand the product, the black, gummy stuff of a fertile soil, is called\r\n\"humus.\" The plants, that is, the higher plants, are not able to live on\r\ntheir own proteids as the animals are. But there are lower plants,\r\ncertain kinds of bacteria, that can break up the big complicated proteid\r\nmolecules into their component parts and reduce the nitrogen in them to\r\nammonia or ammonia-like compounds. Having done this they stop and turn\r\nover the job to another set of bacteria to be carried through the next\r\nstep. For you must know that soil society is as complex and specialized\r\nas that above ground and the tiniest bacterium would die rather than\r\nviolate the union rules. The second set of bacteria change the ammonia\r\nover to nitrites and then a third set, the Amalgamated Union of Nitrate\r\nWorkers, steps in and completes the process of oxidation with an\r\nefficiency that Ostwald might envy, for ninety-six per cent. of the\r\nammonia of the soil is converted into nitrates. But if the conditions\r\nare not just right, if the food is insufficient or unwholesome or if\r\nthe air that circulates through the soil is contaminated with poison\r\ngases, the bacteria go on a strike. The farmer, not seeing the thing\r\nfrom the standpoint of the bacteria, says the soil is \"sick\" and he\r\nproceeds to doctor it according to his own notion of what ails it. First\r\nperhaps he tries running in strike breakers. He goes to one of the firms\r\nthat makes a business of supplying nitrogen-fixing bacteria from the\r\nscabs or nodules of the clover roots and scatters these colonies over\r\nthe field. But if the living conditions remain bad the newcomers will\r\nsoon quit work too and the farmer loses his money. If he is wise, then,\r\nhe will remedy the conditions, putting a better ventilation system in\r\nhis soil perhaps or neutralizing the sourness by means of lime or\r\nkilling off the ameboid banditti that prey upon the peaceful bacteria\r\nengaged in the nitrogen industry. It is not an easy job that the farmer\r\nhas in keeping billions of billions of subterranean servants contented\r\nand working together, but if he does not succeed at this he wastes his\r\nseed and labor.\r\n\r\nThe layman regards the soil as a platform or anchoring place on which to\r\nset plants. He measures its value by its superficial area without\r\nconsidering its contents, which is as absurd as to estimate a man's\r\nwealth by the size of his safe. The difference in point of view is well\r\nillustrated by the old story of the city chap who was showing his farmer\r\nuncle the sights of New York. When he took him to Central Park he tried\r\nto astonish him by saying \"This land is worth $500,000 an acre.\" The old\r\nfarmer dug his toe into the ground, kicked out a clod, broke it open,\r\nlooked at it, spit on it and squeezed it in his hand and then said,\r\n\"Don't you believe it; 'tain't worth ten dollars an acre. Mighty poor\r\nsoil I call it.\" Both were right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of American Cyanamid Co.\r\n\r\nFIXING NITROGEN BY CALCIUM CARBIDE\r\n\r\nA view of the oven room in the plant of the American Cyanamid Company.\r\nThe steel cylinders standing in the background are packed with the\r\ncarbide and then put into the ovens sunk in the floor.

Of course the\r\nnecessity of feeding the soil has been known ever since man began to\r\nsettle down and the ancient methods of maintaining its fertility, though\r\ndiscovered accidentally and followed blindly, were sound and\r\nefficacious. Virgil, who like Liberty Hyde Bailey was fond of publishing\r\nagricultural bulletins in poetry, wrote two thousand years ago:\r\n\r\n  But sweet vicissitudes of rest and toil\r\n  Make easy labor and renew the soil\r\n  Yet sprinkle sordid ashes all around\r\n  And load with fatt'ning dung thy fallow soil.\r\n\r\nThe ashes supplied the potash and the dung the nitrate and phosphate.\r\nLong before the discovery of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the custom\r\nprevailed of sowing pea-like plants every third year and then plowing\r\nthem under to enrich the soil. But such local supplies were always\r\ninadequate and as soon as deposits of fertilizers were discovered\r\nanywhere in the world they were drawn upon. The richest of these was the\r\nChincha Islands off the coast of Peru, where millions of penguins and\r\npelicans had lived in a most untidy manner for untold centuries. The\r\nguano composed of the excrement of the birds mixed with the remains of\r\ndead birds and the fishes they fed upon was piled up to a depth of 120\r\nfeet. From this Isle of Penguins--which is not that described by Anatole\r\nFrance--a billion dollars' worth of guano was taken and the deposit was\r\nsoon exhausted.\r\n\r\nThen the attention of the world was directed to the mainland of Peru and\r\nChile, where similar guano deposits had been accumulated and, not being\r\nwashed away on account of the lack of rain, had been deposited as sodium\r\nnitrate, or \"saltpeter.\" These beds were discovered by a German, Taddeo\r\nHaenke, in 1809, but it was not until the last quarter of the century\r\nthat the nitrates came into common use as a fertilizer. Since then more\r\nthan 53,000,000 tons have been taken out of these beds and the\r\nexportation has risen to a rate of 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 tons a year.\r\nHow much longer they will last is a matter of opinion and opinion is\r\nlargely influenced by whether you have your money invested in Chilean\r\nnitrate stock or in one of the new synthetic processes for making\r\nnitrates. The United States Department of Agriculture says the nitrate\r\nbeds will be exhausted in a few years. On the other hand the Chilean\r\nInspector General of Nitrate Deposits in his latest official report says\r\nthat they will last for two hundred years at the present rate and that\r\nthen there are incalculable areas of low grade deposits, containing less\r\nthan eleven per cent., to be drawn upon.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the South American beds cannot long supply the world's need of\r\nnitrates and we shall some time be starving unless creative chemistry\r\ncomes to the rescue. In 1898 Sir William Crookes--the discoverer of the\r\n\"Crookes tubes,\" the radiometer and radiant matter--startled the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science by declaring that the world\r\nwas nearing the limit of wheat production and that by 1931 the\r\nbread-eaters, the Caucasians, would have to turn to other grains or\r\nrestrict their population while the rice and millet eaters of Asia would\r\ncontinue to increase. Sir William was laughed at then as a\r\nsensationalist. He was, but his sensations were apt to prove true and it\r\nis already evident that he was too near right for comfort. Before we\r\nwere half way to the date he set we had two wheatless days a week,\r\nthough that was because we persisted in shooting nitrates into the air.\r\nThe area producing wheat was by decades:[1]\r\n\r\nTHE WHEAT FIELDS OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n                      Acres\r\n\r\n1881-90             192,000,000\r\n1890-1900           211,000,000\r\n1900-10             242,000,000\r\nProbable limit      300,000,000\r\n\r\nIf 300,000,000 acres can be brought under cultivation for wheat and the\r\naverage yield raised to twenty bushels to the acre, that will give\r\nenough to feed a billion people if they eat six bushels a year as do the\r\nEnglish. Whether this maximum is correct or not there is evidently some\r\nlimit to the area which has suitable soil and climate for growing wheat,\r\nso we are ultimately thrown back upon Crookes's solution of the problem;\r\nthat is, we must increase the yield per acre and this can only be done\r\nby the use of fertilizers and especially by the fixation of atmospheric\r\nnitrogen. Crookes estimated the average yield of wheat at 12.7 bushels\r\nto the acre, which is more than it is in the new lands of the United\r\nStates, Australia and Russia, but less than in Europe, where the soil is\r\nwell fed. What can be done to increase the yield may be seen from these\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n  GAIN IN THE YIELD OF WHEAT IN BUSHELS PER ACRE\r\n\r\n                     1889-90  1913\r\n\r\n  Germany              19      35\r\n  Belgium              30      35\r\n  France               17      20\r\n  United Kingdom       28      32\r\n  United States        12      15\r\n\r\nThe greatest gain was made in Germany and we see a reason for it in the\r\nfact that the German importation of Chilean saltpeter was 55,000 tons in\r\n1880 and 747,000 tons in 1913. In potatoes, too, Germany gets twice as\r\nbig a crop from the same ground as we do, 223 bushels per acre instead\r\nof our 113 bushels. But the United States uses on the average only 28\r\npounds of fertilizer per acre, while Europe uses 200.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we cannot rely upon Chile, but make nitrates for\r\nourselves as Germany had to in war time. In the first chapter we\r\nconsidered the new methods of fixing the free nitrogen from the air. But\r\nthe fixation of nitrogen is a new business in this country and our chief\r\nreliance so far has been the coke ovens. When coal is heated in retorts\r\nor ovens for making coke or gas a lot of ammonia comes off with the\r\nother products of decomposition and is caught in the sulfuric acid used\r\nto wash the gas as ammonium sulfate. Our American coke-makers have been\r\nin the habit of letting this escape into the air and consequently we\r\nhave been losing some 700,000 tons of ammonium salts every year, enough\r\nto keep our land rich and give us all the explosives we should need. But\r\nnow they are reforming and putting in ovens that save the by-products\r\nsuch as ammonia and coal tar, so in 1916 we got from this source 325,000\r\ntons a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of _Scientific American_.\r\n\r\nConsumption of potash for agricultural purposes in different countries]\r\n\r\nGermany had a natural monopoly of potash as Chile had a natural monopoly\r\nof nitrates. The agriculture of Europe and America has been virtually\r\ndependent upon these two sources of plant foods. Now when the world was\r\ncleft in twain by the shock of August, 1914, the Allied Powers had the\r\nnitrates and the Central Powers had the potash. If Germany had not had\r\nup her sleeve a new process for making nitrates she could not long have\r\ncarried on a war and doubtless would not have ventured upon it. But the\r\noutside world had no such substitute for the German potash salts and\r\nhas not yet discovered one. Consequently the price of potash in the\r\nUnited States jumped from $40 to $400 and the cost of food went up with\r\nit. Even under the stimulus of prices ten times the normal and with\r\nchemists searching furnace crannies and bad lands the United States was\r\nable to scrape up less than 10,000 tons of potash in 1916, and this was\r\nbarely enough to satisfy our needs for two weeks!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: What happened to potash when the war broke out. This\r\ndiagram from the _Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_ of\r\nJuly, 1917, shows how the supply of potassium muriate from Germany was\r\nshut off in 1914 and how its price rose.]\r\n\r\nYet potash compounds are as cheap as dirt. Pick up a handful of gravel\r\nand you will be able to find much of it feldspar or other mineral\r\ncontaining some ten per cent. of potash. Unfortunately it is in\r\ncombination with silica, which is harder to break up than a trust.\r\n\r\nBut \"constant washing wears away stones\" and the potash that the\r\nmetallurgist finds too hard to extract in his hottest furnace is washed\r\nout in the course of time through the dropping of the gentle rain from\r\nheaven. \"All rivers run to the sea\" and so the sea gets salt, all sorts\r\nof salts, principally sodium chloride (our table salt) and next\r\nmagnesium, calcium and potassium chlorides or sulfates in this order of\r\nabundance. But if we evaporate sea-water down to dryness all these are\r\nleft in a mix together and it is hard to sort them out. Only patient\r\nNature has time for it and she only did on a large scale in one place,\r\nthat is at Stassfurt, Germany. It seems that in the days when\r\nnorthwestern Prussia was undetermined whether it should be sea or land\r\nit was flooded annually by sea-water. As this slowly evaporated the\r\ndissolved salts crystallized out at the critical points, leaving beds of\r\nvarious combinations. Each year there would be deposited three to five\r\ninches of salts with a thin layer of calcium sulfate or gypsum on top.\r\nCounting these annual layers, like the rings on a stump, we find that\r\nthe Stassfurt beds were ten thousand years in the making. They were\r\nfirst worked for their salt, common salt, alone, but in 1837 the\r\nPrussian Government began prospecting for new and deeper deposits and\r\nfound, not the clean rock salt that they wanted, but bittern, largely\r\nmagnesium sulfate or Epsom salt, which is not at all nice for table use.\r\nThis stuff was first thrown away until it was realized that it was much\r\nmore valuable for the potash it contains than was the rock salt they\r\nwere after. Then the Germans began to purify the Stassfurt salts and\r\nmarket them throughout the world. They contain from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of magnesium chloride mixed with magnesium\r\nchloride in \"carnallite,\" with magnesium sulfate in \"kainite\" and sodium\r\nchloride in \"sylvinite.\" More than thirty thousand miners and workmen\r\nare employed in the Stassfurt works. There are some seventy distinct\r\nestablishments engaged in the business, but they are in combination. In\r\nfact they are compelled to be, for the German Government is as anxious\r\nto promote trusts as the American Government is to prevent them. Once\r\nthe Stassfurt firms had a falling out and began a cutthroat competition.\r\nBut the German Government objects to its people cutting each other's\r\nthroats. American dealers were getting unheard of bargains when the\r\nGerman Government stepped in and compelled the competing corporations to\r\nrecombine under threat of putting on an export duty that would eat up\r\ntheir profits.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of such business coöperation are specially shown in\r\nopening up a new market for an unknown product as in the case of the\r\nintroduction of the Stassfurt salts into American agriculture. The\r\nfarmer in any country is apt to be set in his ways and when it comes to\r\ninducing him to spend his hard-earned money for chemicals that he never\r\nheard of and could not pronounce he--quite rightly--has to be shown.\r\nWell, he was shown. It was, if I remember right, early in the nineties\r\nthat the German Kali Syndikat began operations in America and the United\r\nStates Government became its chief advertising agent. In every state\r\nthere was an agricultural experiment station and these were provided\r\nliberally with illustrated literature on Stassfurt salts with colored\r\nwall charts and sets of samples and free sacks of salts for field\r\nexperiments. The station men, finding that they could rely upon the\r\nscientific accuracy of the information supplied by Kali and that the\r\nexperiments worked out well, became enthusiastic advocates of potash\r\nfertilizers. The station bulletins--which Uncle Sam was kind enough to\r\ncarry free to all the farmers of the state--sometimes were worded so\r\nlike the Kali Company advertising that the company might have raised a\r\ncomplaint of plagiarizing, but they never did. The Chilean nitrates,\r\nwhich are under British control, were later introduced by similar\r\nmethods through the agency of the state agricultural experiment\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this missionary work, which cost the Kali Company\r\n$50,000 a year, the attention of a large proportion of American farmers\r\nwas turned toward intensive farming and they began to realize the\r\nnecessity of feeding the soil that was feeding them. They grew dependent\r\nupon these two foreign and widely separated sources of supply. In the\r\nyear before the war the United States imported a million tons of\r\nStassfurt salts, for which the farmers paid more than $20,000,000. Then\r\na declaration of American independence--the German embargo of 1915--cut\r\nus off from Stassfurt and for five years we had to rely upon our own\r\nresources. We have seen how Germany--shut off from Chile--solved the\r\nnitrogen problem for her fields and munition plants. It was not so easy\r\nfor us--shut off from Germany--to solve the potash problem.\r\n\r\nThere is no more lack of potash in the rocks than there is of nitrogen\r\nin the air, but the nitrogen is free and has only to be caught and\r\ncombined, while the potash is shut up in a granite prison from which it\r\nis hard to get it free. It is not the percentage in the soil but the\r\npercentage in the soil water that counts. A farmer with his potash\r\nlocked up in silicates is like the merchant who has left the key of his\r\nsafe at home in his other trousers. He may be solvent, but he cannot\r\nmeet a sight draft. It is only solvent potash that passes current.\r\n\r\nIn the days of our grandfathers we had not only national independence\r\nbut household independence. Every homestead had its own potash plant and\r\nsoap factory. The frugal housewife dumped the maple wood ashes of the\r\nfireplace into a hollow log set up on end in the backyard. Water poured\r\nover the ashes leached out the lye, which drained into a bucket beneath.\r\nThis gave her a solution of pearl ash or potassium carbonate whose\r\nconcentration she tested with an egg as a hydrometer. In the meantime\r\nshe had been saving up all the waste grease from the frying pan and pork\r\nrinds from the plate and by trying out these she got her soap fat. Then\r\non a day set apart for this disagreeable process in chemical technology\r\nshe boiled the fat and the lye together and got \"soft soap,\" or as the\r\nchemist would call it, potassium stearate. If she wanted hard soap she\r\n\"salted it out\" with brine. The sodium stearate being less soluble was\r\nprecipitated to the top and cooled into a solid cake that could be cut\r\ninto bars by pack thread. But the frugal housewife threw away in the\r\nwaste water what we now consider the most valuable ingredients, the\r\npotash and the glycerin.\r\n\r\nBut the old lye-leach is only to be found in ruins on an abandoned farm\r\nand we no longer burn wood at the rate of a log a night. In 1916 even\r\nunder the stimulus of tenfold prices the amount of potash produced as\r\npearl ash was only 412 tons--and we need 300,000 tons in some form. It\r\nwould, of course, be very desirable as a conservation measure if all the\r\nsawdust and waste wood were utilized by charring it in retorts. The gas\r\nmakes a handy fuel. The tar washed from the gas contains a lot of\r\nvaluable products. And potash can be leached out of the charcoal or from\r\nits ashes whenever it is burned. But this at best would not go far\r\ntoward solving the problem of our national supply.\r\n\r\nThere are other potash-bearing wastes that might be utilized. The cement\r\nmills which use feldspar in combination with limestone give off a potash\r\ndust, very much to the annoyance of their neighbors. This can be\r\ncollected by running the furnace clouds into large settling chambers or\r\nlong flues, where the dust may be caught in bags, or washed out by water\r\nsprays or thrown down by electricity. The blast furnaces for iron also\r\nthrow off potash-bearing fumes.\r\n\r\nOur six-million-ton crop of sugar beets contains some 12,000 tons of\r\nnitrogen, 4000 tons of phosphoric acid and 18,000 tons of potash, all of\r\nwhich is lost except where the waste liquors from the sugar factory are\r\nused in irrigating the beet land. The beet molasses, after extracting\r\nall the sugar possible by means of lime, leaves a waste liquor from\r\nwhich the potash can be recovered by evaporation and charring and\r\nleaching the residue. The Germans get 5000 tons of potassium cyanide and\r\nas much ammonium sulfate annually from the waste liquor of their beet\r\nsugar factories and if it pays them to save this it ought to pay us\r\nwhere potash is dearer. Various other industries can put in a bit when\r\nUncle Sam passes around the contribution basket marked \"Potash for the\r\nPoor.\" Wool wastes and fish refuse make valuable fertilizers, although\r\nthey will not go far toward solving the problem. If we saved all our\r\npotash by-products they would not supply more than fifteen per cent. of\r\nour needs.\r\n\r\nThough no potash beds comparable to those of Stassfurt have yet been\r\ndiscovered in the United States, yet in Nebraska, Utah, California and\r\nother western states there are a number of alkali lakes, wet or dry,\r\ncontaining a considerable amount of potash mixed with soda salts. Of\r\nthese deposits the largest is Searles Lake, California. Here there are\r\nsome twelve square miles of salt crust some seventy feet deep and the\r\nbrine as pumped out contains about four per cent. of potassium chloride.\r\nThe quantity is sufficient to supply the country for over twenty years,\r\nbut it is not an easy or cheap job to separate the potassium from the\r\nsodium salts which are five times more abundant. These being less\r\nsoluble than the potassium salts crystallize out first when the brine is\r\nevaporated. The final crystallization is done in vacuum pans as in\r\ngetting sugar from the cane juice. In this way the American Trona\r\nCorporation is producing some 4500 tons of potash salts a month besides\r\na thousand tons of borax. The borax which is contained in the brine to\r\nthe extent of 1-1/2 per cent. is removed from the fertilizer for a\r\ndouble reason. It is salable by itself and it is detrimental to plant\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnother mineral source of potash is alunite, which is a sort of natural\r\nalum, or double sulfate of potassium and aluminum, with about ten per\r\ncent. of potash. It contains a lot of extra alumina, but after roasting\r\nin a kiln the potassium sulfate can be leached out. The alunite beds\r\nnear Marysville, Utah, were worked for all they were worth during the\r\nwar, but the process does not give potash cheap enough for our needs in\r\nordinary times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by International Film Service\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO SECURE A NEW SUPPLY OF POTASH SALTS\r\n\r\nThe United States Government set up an experimental plant at Sutherland,\r\nCalifornia, for the utilization of kelp. The harvester cuts 40 tons of\r\nkelp at a load]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KELP HARVESTER GATHERING THE SEAWEED FROM THE\r\nPACIFIC OCEAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of Hercules Powder Co.\r\n\r\nOVERHEAD SUCTION AT THE SAN DIEGO WHARF PUMPING KELP FROM THE BARGE TO\r\nTHE DIGESTION TANKS]\r\n\r\nThe tourist going through Wyoming on the Union Pacific will have to the\r\nnorth of him what is marked on the map as the \"Leucite Hills.\" If he\r\nlooks up the word in the Unabridged that he carries in his satchel he\r\nwill find that leucite is a kind of lava and that it contains potash.\r\nBut he will also observe that the potash is combined with alumina and\r\nsilica, which are hard to get out and useless when you get them out. One\r\nof the lavas of the Leucite Hills, that named from its native state\r\n\"Wyomingite,\" gives fifty-seven per cent. of its potash in a soluble\r\nform on roasting with alunite--but this costs too much. The same may be\r\nsaid of all the potash feldspars and mica. They are abundant enough, but\r\nuntil we find a way of utilizing the by-products, say the silica in\r\ncement and the aluminum as a metal, they cannot solve our problem.\r\n\r\nSince it is so hard to get potash from the land it has been suggested\r\nthat we harvest the sea. The experts of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture have placed high hopes in the kelp or giant seaweed which\r\nfloats in great masses in the Pacific Ocean not far off from the\r\nCalifornia coast. This is harvested with ocean reapers run by gasoline\r\nengines and brought in barges to the shore, where it may be dried and\r\nused locally as a fertilizer or burned and the potassium chloride\r\nleached out of the charcoal ashes. But it is hard to handle the bulky,\r\nslimy seaweed cheaply enough to get out of it the small amount of potash\r\nit contains. So efforts are now being made to get more out of the kelp\r\nthan the potash. Instead of burning the seaweed it is fermented in vats\r\nproducing acetic acid (vinegar). From the resulting liquid can be\r\nobtained lime acetate, potassium chloride, potassium iodide, acetone,\r\nethyl acetate (used as a solvent for guncotton) and algin, a\r\ngelatin-like gum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF POTASH IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\n                    |                          |\r\n                    |           1916           |           1917\r\n       Source       | Tons K_{2}O | Per cent.  | Tons K_{2}O | Per cent.\r\n                    |             |  of total  |             |  of total\r\n                    |             | production |             | production\r\n____________________|_____________|____________|_____________|____________\r\n                    |             |            |             |\r\nMineral sources:    |             |            |             |\r\n  Natural brines    |    3,994    |    41.1    |   20,652    |    63.4\r\n  Altmite           |    1,850    |    19.0    |    2,402    |     7.3\r\n  Dust from cement  |             |            |             |\r\n    mills           |             |            |    1,621    |     5.0\r\n  Dust from blast   |             |            |             |\r\n    furnaces        |             |            |      185    |     0.6\r\nOrganic Sources:    |             |            |             |\r\n  Kelp              |    1,556    |    16.0    |    3,752    |    10.9\r\n  Molasses residue  |             |            |             |\r\n    from distillers |    1,845    |    19.0    |    2,846    |     8.8\r\n  Wood ashes        |      412    |     4.2    |      621    |     1.9\r\n  Waste liquors     |             |            |             |\r\n    from beet-sugar |             |            |             |\r\n    refineries      |             |            |      369    |     1.1\r\n  Miscellaneous     |             |            |             |\r\n    industrial      |             |            |             |\r\n    wastes          |       63    |       .7   |      305    |     1.0\r\n                    | ___________ | __________ | ___________ | __________\r\n                    |             |            |             |\r\nTotal               |    9,720    |    100.0   |   32,573    |   100.0\r\n\r\n    --From U S.

The minimum yearly requirements of\r\nthe United States are estimated to be 250,000 tons of potash.\r\n\r\nThis completes our survey of the visible sources of potash in America.\r\nIn 1917 under the pressure of the embargo and unprecedented prices the\r\noutput of potash (K_{2}O) in various forms was raised to 32,573 tons,\r\nbut this is only about a tenth as much as we needed. In 1918 potash\r\nproduction was further raised to 52,135 tons, chiefly through the\r\nincrease of the output from natural brines to 39,255 tons, nearly twice\r\nwhat it was the year before. The rust in cotton and the resulting\r\ndecrease in yield during the war are laid to lack of potash. Truck crops\r\ngrown in soils deficient in potash do not stand transportation well. The\r\nBureau of Animal Industry has shown in experiments in Aroostook County,\r\nMaine, that the addition of moderate amounts of potash doubled the yield\r\nof potatoes.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ostwald, the great Leipzig chemist, boasted in the war:\r\n\r\n     America went into the war like a man with a rope round his neck\r\n     which is in his enemy's hands and is pretty tightly drawn. With\r\n     its tremendous deposits Germany has a world monopoly in potash,\r\n     a point of immense value which cannot be reckoned too highly\r\n     when once this war is going to be settled. It is in Germany's\r\n     power to dictate which of the nations shall have plenty of food\r\n     and which shall starve.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, some mineralogist or metallurgist will cut that rope by\r\nshowing us a supply of cheap potash we will erect him a monument as big\r\nas Washington's. But Ostwald is wrong in supposing that America is as\r\ndependent as Germany upon potash. The bulk of our food crops are at\r\npresent raised without the use of any fertilizers whatever.\r\n\r\nAs the cession of Lorraine in 1871 gave Germany the phosphates she\r\nneeded for fertilizers so the retrocession of Alsace in 1919 gives\r\nFrance the potash she needed for fertilizers. Ten years before the war a\r\nbed of potash was discovered in the Forest of Monnebruck, near\r\nHartmannsweilerkopf, the peak for which French and Germans contested so\r\nfiercely and so long. The layer of potassium salts is 16-1/2 feet thick\r\nand the total deposit is estimated to be 275,000,000 tons of potash. At\r\nany rate it is a formidable rival of Stassfurt and its acquisition by\r\nFrance breaks the German monopoly.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the consideration of the third plant food we feel\r\nbetter. While the United States has no such monopoly of phosphates as\r\nGermany had of potash and Chile had of nitrates we have an abundance and\r\nto spare. Whereas we formerly _imported_ about $17,000,000 worth of\r\npotash from Germany and $20,000,000 worth of nitrates from Chile a year\r\nwe _exported_ $7,000,000 worth of phosphates.\r\n\r\nWhoever it was who first noticed that the grass grew thicker around a\r\nburied bone he lived so long ago that we cannot do honor to his powers\r\nof observation, but ever since then--whenever it was--old bones have\r\nbeen used as a fertilizer. But we long ago used up all the buffalo bones\r\nwe could find on the prairies and our packing houses could not give us\r\nenough bone-meal to go around, so we have had to draw upon the old\r\nbone-yards of prehistoric animals. Deposits of lime phosphate of such\r\norigin were found in South Carolina in 1870 and in Florida in 1888.\r\nSince then the industry has developed with amazing rapidity until in\r\n1913 the United States produced over three million tons of phosphates,\r\nnearly half of which was sent abroad. The chief source at present is the\r\nFlorida pebbles, which are dredged up from the bottoms of lakes and\r\nrivers or washed out from the banks of streams by a hydraulic jet. The\r\ngravel is washed free from the sand and clay, screened and dried, and\r\nthen is ready for shipment. The rock deposits of Florida and South\r\nCarolina are more limited than the pebble beds and may be exhausted in\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years, but Tennessee and Kentucky have a lot in\r\nreserve and behind them are Idaho, Wyoming and other western states with\r\nmillions of acres of phosphate land, so in this respect we are\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nBut even here the war hit us hard. For the calcium phosphate as it comes\r\nfrom the ground is not altogether available because it is not very\r\nsoluble and the plants can only use what they can get in the water that\r\nthey suck up from the soil. But if the phosphate is treated with\r\nsulfuric acid it becomes more soluble and this product is sold as\r\n\"superphosphate.\" The sulfuric acid is made mostly from iron pyrite and\r\nthis we have been content to import, over 800,000 tons of it a year,\r\nlargely from Spain, although we have an abundance at home. Since the\r\nshortage of shipping shut off the foreign supply we are using more of\r\nour own pyrite and also our deposits of native sulfur along the Gulf\r\ncoast. But as a consequence of this sulfuric acid during the war went up\r\nfrom $5 to $25 a ton and acidulated phosphates rose correspondingly.\r\n\r\nGermany is short on natural phosphates as she is long on natural potash.\r\nBut she has made up for it by utilizing a by-product of her steelworks.\r\nWhen phosphorus occurs in iron ore, even in minute amounts, it makes the\r\nsteel brittle. Much of the iron ores of Alsace-Lorraine were formerly\r\nconsidered unworkable because of this impurity, but shortly after\r\nGermany took these provinces from France in 1871 a method was discovered\r\nby two British metallurgists, Thomas and Gilchrist, by which the\r\nphosphorus is removed from the iron in the process of converting it into\r\nsteel. This consists in lining the crucible or converter with lime and\r\nmagnesia, which takes up the phosphorus from the melted iron. This slag\r\nlining, now rich in phosphates, can be taken out and ground up for\r\nfertilizer. So the phosphorus which used to be a detriment is now an\r\nadditional source of profit and this British invention has enabled\r\nGermany to make use of the territory she stole from France to outstrip\r\nEngland in the steel business. In 1910 Germany produced 2,000,000 tons\r\nof Thomas slag while only 160,000 tons were produced in the United\r\nKingdom. The open hearth process now chiefly used in the United States\r\ngives an acid instead of a basic phosphate slag, not suitable as a\r\nfertilizer. The iron ore of America, with the exception of some of the\r\nsouthern ores, carries so small a percentage of phosphorus as to make a\r\nbasic process inadvisable.\r\n\r\nRecently the Germans have been experimenting with a combined fertilizer,\r\nSchröder's potassium phosphate, which is said to be as good as Thomas\r\nslag for phosphates and as good as Stassfurt salts for potash. The\r\nAmerican Cyanamid Company is just putting out a similar product,\r\n\"Ammo-Phos,\" in which the ammonia can be varied from thirteen to twenty\r\nper cent. and the phosphoric acid from twenty to forty-seven per cent.\r\nso as to give the proportions desired for any crop. We have then the\r\npossibility of getting the three essential plant foods altogether in\r\none compound with the elimination of most of the extraneous elements\r\nsuch as lime and magnesia, chlorids and sulfates.\r\n\r\nFor the last three hundred years the American people have been living on\r\nthe unearned increment of the unoccupied land. But now that all our land\r\nhas been staked out in homesteads and we cannot turn to new soil when we\r\nhave used up the old, we must learn, as the older races have learned,\r\nhow to keep up the supply of plant food. Only in this way can our\r\npopulation increase and prosper. As we have seen, the phosphate question\r\nneed not bother us and we can see our way clear toward solving the\r\nnitrate question. We gave the Government $20,000,000 to experiment on\r\nthe production of nitrates from the air and the results will serve for\r\nfields as well as firearms. But the question of an independent supply of\r\ncheap potash is still unsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCOAL-TAR COLORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you put a bit of soft coal into a test tube (or, if you haven't a\r\ntest tube, into a clay tobacco pipe and lute it over with clay) and heat\r\nit you will find a gas coming out of the end of the tube that will burn\r\nwith a yellow smoky flame. After all the gas comes off you will find in\r\nthe bottom of the test tube a chunk of dry, porous coke. These, then,\r\nare the two main products of the destructive distillation of coal. But\r\nif you are an unusually observant person, that is, if you are a born\r\nchemist with an eye to by-products, you will notice along in the middle\r\nof the tube where it is neither too hot nor too cold some dirty drops of\r\nwater and some black sticky stuff. If you are just an ordinary person,\r\nyou won't pay any attention to this because there is only a little of it\r\nand because what you are after is the coke and gas. You regard the\r\nnasty, smelly mess that comes in between as merely a nuisance because it\r\nclogs up and spoils your nice, clean tube.\r\n\r\nNow that is the way the gas-makers and coke-makers--being for the most\r\npart ordinary persons and not born chemists--used to regard the water\r\nand tar that got into their pipes. They washed it out so as to have the\r\ngas clean and then ran it into the creek. But the neighbors--especially\r\nthose who fished in the stream below the gas-works--made a fuss about\r\nspoiling the water, so the gas-men gave away the tar to the boys for use\r\nin celebrating the Fourth of July and election night or sold it for\r\nroofing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRODUCTION OF COAL TAR\r\n\r\nA battery of Koppers by-product coke-ovens at the plant of the Bethlehem\r\nSteel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland. The coke is being pushed out of\r\none of the ovens into the waiting car. The vapors given off from the\r\ncoal contain ammonia and the benzene compound used to make dyes and\r\nexplosives]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THESE MIXING VATS AT THE BUFFALO WORKS, ANILINE DYES\r\nARE PREPARED]\r\n\r\nBut this same tar, which for a hundred years was thrown away and nearly\r\nhalf of which is thrown away yet in the United States, turns out to be\r\none of the most useful things in the world. It is one of the strategic\r\npoints in war and commerce. It wounds and heals. It supplies munitions\r\nand medicines. It is like the magic purse of Fortunatus from which\r\nanything wished for could be drawn. The chemist puts his hand into the\r\nblack mass and draws out all the colors of the rainbow. This\r\nevil-smelling substance beats the rose in the production of perfume and\r\nsurpasses the honey-comb in sweetness.\r\n\r\nBishop Berkeley, after having proved that all matter was in your mind,\r\nwrote a book to prove that wood tar would cure all diseases. Nobody\r\nreads it now. The name is enough to frighten them off: \"Siris: A Chain\r\nof Philosophical Reflections and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tar\r\nWater.\" He had a sort of mystical idea that tar contained the\r\nquintessence of the forest, the purified spirit of the trees, which\r\ncould somehow revive the spirit of man. People said he was crazy on the\r\nsubject, and doubtless he was, but the interesting thing about it is\r\nthat not even his active and ingenious imagination could begin to\r\nsuggest all of the strange things that can be got out of tar, whether\r\nwood or coal.\r\n\r\nThe reason why tar supplies all sorts of useful material is because it\r\nis indeed the quintessence of the forest, of the forests of untold\r\nmillenniums if it is coal tar. If you are acquainted with a village\r\ntinker, one of those all-round mechanics who still survive in this age\r\nof specialization and can mend anything from a baby-carriage to an\r\nautomobile, you will know that he has on the floor of his back shop a\r\nheap of broken machinery from which he can get almost anything he wants,\r\na copper wire, a zinc plate, a brass screw or a steel rod. Now coal tar\r\nis the scrap-heap of the vegetable kingdom. It contains a little of\r\nalmost everything that makes up trees. But you must not imagine that all\r\nthat comes out of coal tar is contained in it. There are only about a\r\ndozen primary products extracted from coal tar, but from these the\r\nchemist is able to build up hundreds of thousands of new substances.\r\nThis is true creative chemistry, for most of these compounds are not to\r\nbe found in plants and never existed before they were made in the\r\nlaboratory. It used to be thought that organic compounds, the products\r\nof vegetable and animal life, could only be produced by organized\r\nbeings, that they were created out of inorganic matter by the magic\r\ntouch of some \"vital principle.\" But since the chemist has learned how,\r\nhe finds it easier to make organic than inorganic substances and he is\r\nconfident that he can reproduce any compound that he can analyze. He\r\ncannot only imitate the manufacturing processes of the plants and\r\nanimals, but he can often beat them at their own game.\r\n\r\nWhen coal is heated in the open air it is burned up and nothing but the\r\nashes is left. But heat the coal in an enclosed vessel, say a big\r\nfireclay retort, and it cannot burn up because the oxygen of the air\r\ncannot get to it. So it breaks up. All parts of it that can be volatized\r\nat a high heat pass off through the outlet pipe and nothing is left in\r\nthe retort but coke, that is carbon with the ash it contains. When the\r\nescaping vapors reach a cool part of the outlet pipe the oily and tarry\r\nmatter condenses out. Then the gas is passed up through a tower down\r\nwhich water spray is falling and thus is washed free from ammonia and\r\neverything else that is soluble in water.\r\n\r\nThis process is called \"destructive distillation.\" What products come\r\noff depends not only upon the composition of the particular variety of\r\ncoal used, but upon the heat, pressure and rapidity of distillation. The\r\nway you run it depends upon what you are most anxious to have. If you\r\nwant illuminating gas you will leave in it the benzene. If you are after\r\nthe greatest yield of tar products, you impoverish the gas by taking out\r\nthe benzene and get a blue instead of a bright yellow flame. If all you\r\nare after is cheap coke, you do not bother about the by-products, but\r\nlet them escape and burn as they please. The tourist passing across the\r\ncoal region at night could see through his car window the flames of\r\nhundreds of old-fashioned bee-hive coke-ovens and if he were of\r\neconomical mind he might reflect that this display of fireworks was\r\ncosting the country $75,000,000 a year besides consuming the\r\nirreplaceable fuel supply of the future. But since the gas was not\r\nneeded outside of the cities and since the coal tar, if it could be sold\r\nat all, brought only a cent or two a gallon, how could the coke-makers\r\nbe expected to throw out their old bee-hive ovens and put in the\r\nexpensive retorts and towers necessary to the recovery of the\r\nby-products? But within the last ten years the by-product ovens have\r\ncome into use and now nearly half our coke is made in them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the products of destructive distillation vary within wide\r\nlimits, yet the following table may serve to give an approximate idea of\r\nwhat may be got from a ton of soft coal:\r\n\r\n  1 ton of coal may give\r\n      Gas, 12,000 cubic feet\r\n      Liquor (Washings) ammonium sulfate (7-25 pounds)\r\n      Tar (120 pounds)  benzene (10-20 pounds)\r\n                        toluene (3 pounds)\r\n                        xylene  (1-1/2 pounds)\r\n                        phenol  (1/2 pound)\r\n                        naphthalene (3/8 pound)\r\n                        anthracene  (1/4 pound)\r\n                        pitch (80 pounds)\r\n      Coke (1200-1500 pounds)\r\n\r\nWhen the tar is redistilled we get, among other things, the ten \"crudes\"\r\nwhich are fundamental material for making dyes. Their names are:\r\nbenzene, toluene, xylene, phenol, cresol, naphthalene, anthracene,\r\nmethyl anthracene, phenanthrene and carbazol.\r\n\r\nThere! I had to introduce you to the whole receiving line, but now that\r\nthat ceremony is over we are at liberty to do as we do at a reception,\r\nmeet our old friends, get acquainted with one or two more and turn our\r\nbacks on the rest. Two of them, I am sure, you've met before, phenol,\r\nwhich is common carbolic acid, and naphthalene, which we use for\r\nmothballs. But notice one thing in passing, that not one of them is a\r\ndye. They are all colorless liquids or white solids. Also they all have\r\nan indescribable odor--all odors that you don't know are\r\nindescribable--which gives them and their progeny, even when odorless,\r\nthe name of \"aromatic compounds.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Diagram of the products obtained from coal and\r\nsome of their uses.]\r\n\r\nThe most important of the ten because he is the father of the family is\r\nbenzene, otherwise called benzol, but must not be confused with\r\n\"benzine\" spelled with an _i_ which we used to burn and clean our\r\nclothes with. \"Benzine\" is a kind of gasoline, but benzene _alias_\r\nbenzol has quite another constitution, although it looks and burns the\r\nsame. Now the search for the constitution of benzene is one of the most\r\nexciting chapters in chemistry; also one of the most intricate chapters,\r\nbut, in spite of that, I believe I can make the main point of it clear\r\neven to those who have never studied chemistry--provided they retain\r\ntheir childish liking for puzzles. It is really much like putting\r\ntogether the old six-block Chinese puzzle. The chemist can work better\r\nif he has a picture of what he is working with. Now his unit is the\r\nmolecule, which is too small even to analyze with the microscope, no\r\nmatter how high powered. So he makes up a sort of diagram of the\r\nmolecule, and since he knows the number of atoms and that they are\r\nsomehow attached to one another, he represents each atom by the first\r\nletter of its name and the points of attachment or bonds by straight\r\nlines connecting the atoms of the different elements. Now it is one of\r\nthe rules of the game that all the bonds must be connected or hooked up\r\nwith atoms at both ends, that there shall be no free hands reaching out\r\ninto empty space. Carbon, for instance, has four bonds and hydrogen only\r\none. They unite, therefore, in the proportion of one atom of carbon to\r\nfour of hydrogen, or CH_{4}, which is methane or marsh gas and obviously\r\nthe simplest of the hydrocarbons. But we have more complex hydrocarbons\r\nsuch as C_{6}H_{14}, known as hexane. Now if you try to draw the\r\ndiagrams or structural formulas of these two compounds you will easily\r\nget\r\n\r\n    H        H H H H H H\r\n    |        | | | | | |\r\n  H-C-H    H-C-C-C-C-C-C-H\r\n    |        | | | | | |\r\n    H        H H H H H H\r\n  methane      hexane\r\n\r\nEach carbon atom, you see, has its four hands outstretched and duly\r\ngrasped by one-handed hydrogen atoms or by neighboring carbon atoms in\r\nthe chain. We can have such chains as long as you please, thirty or more\r\nin a chain; they are all contained in kerosene and paraffin.\r\n\r\nSo far the chemist found it east to construct diagrams that would\r\nsatisfy his sense of the fitness of things, but when he found that\r\nbenzene had the compostion C_{6}H_{6} he was puzzled. If you try to draw\r\nthe picture of C_{6}H_{6} you will get something like this:\r\n\r\n   | | | | | |\r\n  -C-C-C-C-C-C-\r\n   | | | | | |\r\n   H H H H H H\r\n\r\nwhich is an absurdity because more than half of the carbon hands are\r\nwaving wildly around asking to be held by something. Benzene,\r\nC_{6}H_{6}, evidently is like hexane, C_{6}H_{14}, in having a chain of\r\nsix carbon atoms, but it has dropped its H's like an Englishman. Eight\r\nof the H's are missing.\r\n\r\nNow one of the men who was worried over this benzene puzzle was the\r\nGerman chemist, Kekulé. One evening after working over the problem all\r\nday he was sitting by the fire trying to rest, but he could not throw\r\nit off his mind. The carbon and the hydrogen atoms danced like imps on\r\nthe carpet and as he watched them through his half-closed eyes he\r\nsuddenly saw that the chain of six carbon atoms had joined at the ends\r\nand formed a ring while the six hydrogen atoms were holding on to the\r\noutside hands, in this fashion:\r\n\r\n      H\r\n      |\r\n      C\r\n     / \\\\\r\n  H-C   C-H\r\n    ||  |\r\n  H-C   C-H\r\n     \\ //\r\n      C\r\n      |\r\n      H\r\n\r\nProfessor Kekulé saw at once that the demons of his subconscious self\r\nhad furnished him with a clue to the labyrinth, and so it proved. We\r\nneed not suppose that the benzene molecule if we could see it would look\r\nanything like this diagram of it, but the theory works and that is all\r\nthe scientist asks of any theory. By its use thousands of new compounds\r\nhave been constructed which have proved of inestimable value to man. The\r\nmodern chemist is not a discoverer, he is an inventor. He sits down at\r\nhis desk and draws a \"Kekulé ring\" or rather hexagon. Then he rubs out\r\nan H and hooks a nitro group (NO_{2}) on to the carbon in place of it;\r\nnext he rubs out the O_{2} of the nitro group and puts in H_{2}; then he\r\nhitches on such other elements, or carbon chains and rings as he likes.\r\nHe works like an architect designing a house and when he gets a picture\r\nof the proposed compounds to suit him he goes into the laboratory to\r\nmake it. First he takes down the bottle of benzene and boils up some of\r\nthis with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. This he puts in the nitro group\r\nand makes nitro-benzene, C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}. He treats this with hydrogen,\r\nwhich displaces the oxygen and gives C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} or aniline, which\r\nis the basis of so many of these compounds that they are all commonly\r\ncalled \"the aniline dyes.\" But aniline itself is not a dye. It is a\r\ncolorless or brownish oil.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow our chemist any farther now that we have\r\nseen how he works, but before we pass on we will just look at one of his\r\nproducts, not one of the most complicated but still complicated enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A molecule of a coal-tar dye]\r\n\r\nThe name of this is sodium ditolyl-disazo-beta-naphthylamine-\r\n6-sulfonic-beta-naphthylamine-3.6-disulfonate.\r\n\r\nThese chemical names of organic compounds are discouraging to the\r\nbeginner and amusing to the layman, but that is because neither of them\r\nrealizes that they are not really words but formulas. They are\r\nhyphenated because they come from Germany. The name given above is no\r\nmore of a mouthful than \"a-square-plus-two-a-b-plus-b-square\" or \"Third\r\nAssistant Secretary of War to the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\" The trade name of this dye is Brilliant Congo, but while that\r\nis handier to say it does not mean anything. Nobody but an expert in\r\ndyes would know what it was, while from the formula name any chemist\r\nfamiliar with such compounds could draw its picture, tell how it would\r\nbehave and what it was made from, or even make it. The old alchemist was\r\na secretive and pretentious person and used to invent queer names for\r\nthe purpose of mystifying and awing the ignorant. But the chemist in\r\ndropping the al- has dropped the idea of secrecy and his names, though\r\nequally appalling to the layman, are designed to reveal and not to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief explanation the reader who has not studied chemistry\r\nwill, I think, be able to get some idea of how these very intricate\r\ncompounds are built up step by step. A completed house is hard to\r\nunderstand, but when we see the mason laying one brick on top of another\r\nit does not seem so difficult, although if we tried to do it we should\r\nnot find it so easy as we think. Anyhow, let me give you a hint. If you\r\nwant to make a good impression on a chemist don't tell him that he\r\nseems to you a sort of magician, master of a black art, and all that\r\nnonsense. The chemist has been trying for three hundred years to live\r\ndown the reputation of being inspired of the devil and it makes him mad\r\nto have his past thrown up at him in this fashion. If his tactless\r\nadmirers would stop saying \"it is all a mystery and a miracle to me,\r\nand I cannot understand it\" and pay attention to what he is telling them\r\nthey would understand it and would find that it is no more of a mystery\r\nor a miracle than anything else. You can make an electrician mad in the\r\nsame way by interrupting his explanation of a dynamo by asking: \"But you\r\ncannot tell me what electricity really is.\" The electrician does not\r\ncare a rap what electricity \"really is\"--if there really is any meaning\r\nto that phrase. All he wants to know is what he can do with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPARISON OF COAL AND ITS DISTILLATION PRODUCTS From\r\nHesse's \"The Industry of the Coal Tar Dyes,\" _Journal of Industrial and\r\nEngineering Chemistry_, December, 1914]\r\n\r\nThe tar obtained from the gas plant or the coke plant has now to be\r\nredistilled, giving off the ten \"crudes\" already mentioned and leaving\r\nin the still sixty-five per cent. of pitch, which may be used for\r\nroofing, paving and the like. The ten primary products or crudes are\r\nthen converted into secondary products or \"intermediates\" by processes\r\nlike that for the conversion of benzene into aniline. There are some\r\nthree hundred of these intermediates in use and from them are built up\r\nmore than three times as many dyes. The year before the war the American\r\ncustom house listed 5674 distinct brands of synthetic dyes imported,\r\nchiefly from Germany, but some of these were trade names for the same\r\nproduct made by different firms or represented by different degrees of\r\npurity or form of preparation. Although the number of possible products\r\nis unlimited and over five thousand dyes are known, yet only about nine\r\nhundred are in use. We can summarize the situation so:\r\n\r\n  Coal-tar --> 10 crudes --> 300 intermediates --> 900 dyes --> 5000 brands.\r\n\r\nOr, to borrow the neat simile used by Dr. Bernhard C. Hesse, it is like\r\ncloth-making where \"ten fibers make 300 yarns which are woven into 900\r\npatterns.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the artificial dyestuffs over those found in nature\r\nlies in their variety and adaptability. Practically any desired tint or\r\nshade can be made for any particular fabric. If my lady wants a new kind\r\nof green for her stockings or her hair she can have it. Candies and\r\njellies and drinks can be made more attractive and therefore more\r\nappetizing by varied colors. Easter eggs and Easter bonnets take on new\r\nand brighter hues.\r\n\r\nMore and more the chemist is becoming the architect of his own fortunes.\r\nHe does not make discoveries by picking up a beaker and pouring into it\r\na little from each bottle on the shelf to see what happens. He generally\r\nknows what he is after, and he generally gets it, although he is still\r\noften baffled and occasionally happens on something quite unexpected and\r\nperhaps more valuable than what he was looking for. Columbus was looking\r\nfor India when he ran into an obstacle that proved to be America.\r\nWilliam Henry Perkin was looking for quinine when he blundered into that\r\nrich and undiscovered country, the aniline dyes. William Henry was a\r\nqueer boy. He had rather listen to a chemistry lecture than eat. When he\r\nwas attending the City of London School at the age of thirteen there was\r\nan extra course of lectures on chemistry given at the noon recess, so he\r\nskipped his lunch to take them in. Hearing that a German chemist named\r\nHofmann had opened a laboratory in the Royal College of London he headed\r\nfor that. Hofmann obviously had no fear of forcing the young intellect\r\nprematurely. He perhaps had never heard that \"the tender petals of the\r\nadolescent mind must be allowed to open slowly.\" He admitted young\r\nPerkin at the age of fifteen and started him on research at the end of\r\nhis second year. An American student nowadays thinks he is lucky if he\r\ngets started on his research five years older than Perkin. Now if\r\nHofmann had studied pedagogical psychology he would have been informed\r\nthat nothing chills the ardor of the adolescent mind like being set at\r\ntasks too great for its powers. If he had heard this and believed it, he\r\nwould not have allowed Perkin to spend two years in fruitless endeavors\r\nto isolate phenanthrene from coal tar and to prepare artificial\r\nquinine--and in that case Perkin would never have discovered the aniline\r\ndyes. But Perkin, so far from being discouraged, set up a private\r\nlaboratory so he could work over-time. While working here during the\r\nEaster vacation of 1856--the date is as well worth remembering as\r\n1066--he was oxidizing some aniline oil when he got what chemists most\r\ndetest, a black, tarry mass instead of nice, clean crystals. When he\r\nwent to wash this out with alcohol he was surprised to find that it gave\r\na beautiful purple solution. This was \"mauve,\" the first of the aniline\r\ndyes.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing about it was that when Perkin tried to repeat the\r\nexperiment with purer aniline he could not get his color. It was because\r\nhe was working with impure chemicals, with aniline containing a little\r\ntoluidine, that he discovered mauve. It was, as I said, a lucky\r\naccident. But it was not accidental that the accident happened to the\r\nyoung fellow who spent his noonings and vacations at the study of\r\nchemistry. A man may not find what he is looking for, but he never\r\nfinds anything unless he is looking for something.\r\n\r\nMauve was a product of creative chemistry, for it was a substance that\r\nhad never existed before. Perkin's next great triumph, ten years later,\r\nwas in rivaling Nature in the manufacture of one of her own choice\r\nproducts. This is alizarin, the coloring matter contained in the madder\r\nroot. It was an ancient and oriental dyestuff, known as \"Turkey red\" or\r\nby its Arabic name of \"alizari.\" When madder was introduced into France\r\nit became a profitable crop and at one time half a million tons a year\r\nwere raised. A couple of French chemists, Robiquet and Colin, extracted\r\nfrom madder its active principle, alizarin, in 1828, but it was not\r\nuntil forty years later that it was discovered that alizarin had for its\r\nbase one of the coal-tar products, anthracene. Then came a neck-and-neck\r\nrace between Perkin and his German rivals to see which could discover a\r\ncheap process for making alizarin from anthracene. The German chemists\r\nbeat him to the patent office by one day! Graebe and Liebermann filed\r\ntheir application for a patent on the sulfuric acid process as No. 1936\r\non June 25, 1869. Perkin filed his for the same process as No. 1948 on\r\nJune 26. It had required twenty years to determine the constitution of\r\nalizarin, but within six months from its first synthesis the commercial\r\nprocess was developed and within a few years the sale of artificial\r\nalizarin reached $8,000,000 annually. The madder fields of France were\r\nput to other uses and even the French soldiers became dependent on\r\nmade-in-Germany dyes for their red trousers. The British soldiers were\r\nplaced in a similar situation as regards their red coats when after\r\n1878 the azo scarlets put the cochineal bug out of business.\r\n\r\nThe modern chemist has robbed royalty of its most distinctive insignia,\r\nTyrian purple. In ancient times to be \"porphyrogene,\" that is \"born to\r\nthe purple,\" was like admission to the Almanach de Gotha at the present\r\ntime, for only princes or their wealthy rivals could afford to pay $600\r\na pound for crimsoned linen. The precious dye is secreted by a\r\nsnail-like shellfish of the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. From a\r\ntiny sac behind the head a drop of thick whitish liquid, smelling like\r\ngarlic, can be extracted. If this is spread upon cloth of any kind and\r\nexposed to air and sunlight it turns first green, next blue and then\r\npurple. If the cloth is washed with soap--that is, set by alkali--it\r\nbecomes a fast crimson, such as Catholic cardinals still wear as princes\r\nof the church. The Phoenician merchants made fortunes out of their\r\nmonopoly, but after the fall of Tyre it became one of \"the lost\r\narts\"--and accordingly considered by those whose faces are set toward\r\nthe past as much more wonderful than any of the new arts. But in 1909\r\nFriedlander put an end to the superstition by analyzing Tyrian purple\r\nand finding that it was already known. It was the same as a dye that had\r\nbeen prepared five years before by Sachs but had not come into\r\ncommercial use because of its inferiority to others in the market. It\r\nrequired 12,000 of the mollusks to supply the little material needed for\r\nanalysis, but once the chemist had identified it he did not need to\r\nbother the Murex further, for he could make it by the ton if he had\r\nwanted to. The coloring principle turned out to be a di-brom indigo,\r\nthat is the same as the substance extracted from the Indian plant, but\r\nwith the addition of two atoms of bromine. Why a particular kind of a\r\nshellfish should have got the habit of extracting this rare element from\r\nsea water and stowing it away in this peculiar form is \"one of those\r\nthings no fellow can find out.\" But according to the chemist the Murex\r\nmollusk made a mistake in hitching the bromine to the wrong carbon\r\natoms. He finds as he would word it that the 6:6' di-brom indigo\r\nsecreted by the shellfish is not so good as the 5:5' di-brom indigo now\r\nmanufactured at a cheap rate and in unlimited quantity. But we must not\r\nexpect too much of a mollusk's mind. In their cheapness lies the offense\r\nof the aniline dyes in the minds of some people. Our modern aristocrats\r\nwould delight to be entitled \"porphyrogeniti\" and to wear exclusive\r\ngowns of \"purple and scarlet from the isles of Elishah\" as was done in\r\nEzekiel's time, but when any shopgirl or sailor can wear the royal color\r\nit spoils its beauty in their eyes. Applied science accomplishes a real\r\ndemocracy such as legislation has ever failed to establish.\r\n\r\nAny kind of dye found in nature can be made in the laboratory whenever\r\nits composition is understood and usually it can be made cheaper and\r\npurer than it can be extracted from the plant. But to work out a\r\nprofitable process for making it synthetically is sometimes a task\r\nrequiring high skill, persistent labor and heavy expenditure. One of the\r\nlatest and most striking of these achievements of synthetic chemistry is\r\nthe manufacture of indigo.\r\n\r\nIndigo is one of the oldest and fastest of the dyestuffs. To see that it\r\nis both ancient and lasting look at the unfaded blue cloths that enwrap\r\nan Egyptian mummy. When Caesar conquered our British ancestors he found\r\nthem tattooed with woad, the native indigo. But the chief source of\r\nindigo was, as its name implies, India. In 1897 nearly a million acres\r\nin India were growing the indigo plant and the annual value of the crop\r\nwas $20,000,000. Then the fall began and by 1914 India was producing\r\nonly $300,000 worth! What had happened to destroy this profitable\r\nindustry? Some blight or insect? No, it was simply that the Badische\r\nAnilin-und-Soda Fabrik had worked out a practical process for making\r\nartificial indigo.\r\n\r\nThat indigo on breaking up gave off aniline was discovered as early as\r\n1840. In fact that was how aniline got its name, for when Fritzsche\r\ndistilled indigo with caustic soda he called the colorless distillate\r\n\"aniline,\" from the Arabic name for indigo, \"anil\" or \"al-nil,\" that is,\r\n\"the blue-stuff.\" But how to reverse the process and get indigo from\r\naniline puzzled chemists for more than forty years until finally it was\r\nsolved by Adolf von Baeyer of Munich, who died in 1917 at the age of\r\neighty-four. He worked on the problem of the constitution of indigo for\r\nfifteen years and discovered several ways of making it. It is possible\r\nto start from benzene, toluene or naphthalene. The first process was the\r\neasiest, but if you will refer to the products of the distillation of\r\ntar you will find that the amount of toluene produced is less than the\r\nnaphthalene, which is hard to dispose of. That is, if a dye factory had\r\nworked out a process for making indigo from toluene it would not be\r\npracticable because there was not enough toluene produced to supply the\r\ndemand for indigo. So the more complicated napthalene process was\r\nchosen in preference to the others in order to utilize this by-product.\r\n\r\nThe Badische Anilin-und-Soda Fabrik spent $5,000,000 and seventeen years\r\nin chemical research before they could make indigo, but they gained a\r\nmonopoly (or, to be exact, ninety-six per cent.) of the world's\r\nproduction. A hundred years ago indigo cost as much as $4 a pound. In\r\n1914 we were paying fifteen cents a pound for it. Even the pauper labor\r\nof India could not compete with the German chemists at that price. At\r\nthe beginning of the present century Germany was paying more than\r\n$3,000,000 a year for indigo. Fourteen years later Germany was _selling_\r\nindigo to the amount of $12,600,000. Besides its cheapness, artificial\r\nindigo is preferable because it is of uniform quality and greater\r\npurity. Vegetable indigo contains from forty to eighty per cent. of\r\nimpurities, among them various other tinctorial substances. Artificial\r\nindigo is made pure and of any desired strength, so the dyers can depend\r\non it.\r\n\r\nThe value of the aniline colors lies in their infinite variety. Some are\r\nfast, some will fade, some will stand wear and weather as long as the\r\nfabric, some will wash out on the spot. Dyes can be made that will\r\nattach themselves to wool, to silk or to cotton, and give it any shade\r\nof any color. The period of discovery by accident has long gone by. The\r\nchemist nowadays decides first just what kind of a dye he wants, and\r\nthen goes to work systematically to make it. He begins by drawing a\r\ndiagram of the molecule, double-linking nitrogen or carbon and oxygen\r\natoms to give the required intensity, putting in acid or basic radicals\r\nto fasten it to the fiber, shifting the color back and forth along the\r\nspectrum at will by introducing methyl groups, until he gets it just to\r\nhis liking.\r\n\r\nArt can go ahead of nature in the dyestuff business. Before man found\r\nthat he could make all the dyes he wanted from the tar he had been\r\nburning up at home he searched the wide world over to find colors by\r\nwhich he could make himself--or his wife--garments as beautiful as those\r\nthat arrayed the flower, the bird and the butterfly. He sent divers down\r\ninto the Mediterranean to rob the murex of his purple. He sent ships to\r\nthe new world to get Brazil wood and to the oldest world for indigo. He\r\nrobbed the lady cochineal of her scarlet coat. Why these peculiar\r\nsubstances were formed only by these particular plants, mussels and\r\ninsects it is hard to understand. I don't know that Mrs. Cacti Coccus\r\nderived any benefit from her scarlet uniform when khaki would be safer,\r\nand I can't imagine that to a shellfish it was of advantage to turn red\r\nas it rots or to an indigo plant that its leaves in decomposing should\r\nturn blue. But anyhow, it was man that took advantage of them until he\r\nlearned how to make his own dyestuffs.\r\n\r\nOur independent ancestors got along so far as possible with what grew in\r\nthe neighborhood. Sweetapple bark gave a fine saffron yellow. Ribbons\r\nwere given the hue of the rose by poke berry juice. The Confederates in\r\ntheir butternut-colored uniform were almost as invisible as if in khaki\r\nor _feldgrau_. Madder was cultivated in the kitchen garden. Only logwood\r\nfrom Jamaica and indigo from India had to be imported. That we are not\r\nso independent today is our own fault, for we waste enough coal tar to\r\nsupply ourselves and other countries with all the new dyes needed. It is\r\nessentially a question of economy and organization. We have forgotten\r\nhow to economize, but we have learned how to organize.\r\n\r\nThe British Government gave the discoverer of mauve a title, but it did\r\nnot give him any support in his endeavors to develop the industry,\r\nalthough England led the world in textiles and needed more dyes than any\r\nother country. So in 1874 Sir William Perkin relinquished the attempt to\r\nmanufacture the dyes he had discovered because, as he said, Oxford and\r\nCambridge refused to educate chemists or to carry on research. Their\r\nstudents, trained in the classics for the profession of being a\r\ngentleman, showed a decided repugnance to the laboratory on account of\r\nits bad smells. So when Hofmann went home he virtually took the infant\r\nindustry along with him to Germany, where Ph.D.'s were cheap and\r\nplentiful and not afraid of bad smells. There the business throve\r\namazingly, and by 1914 the Germans were manufacturing more than\r\nthree-fourths of all the coal-tar products of the world and supplying\r\nmaterial for most of the rest. The British cursed the universities for\r\nthus imperiling the nation through their narrowness and neglect; but\r\nthis accusation, though natural, was not altogether fair, for at least\r\nhalf the blame should go to the British dyer, who did not care where his\r\ncolors came from, so long as they were cheap. When finally the\r\nuniversities did turn over a new leaf and began to educate chemists, the\r\nmanufacturers would not employ them. Before the war six English\r\nfactories producing dyestuffs employed only 35 chemists altogether,\r\nwhile one German color works, the Höchster Farbwerke, employed 307\r\nexpert chemists and 74 technologists.\r\n\r\nThis firm united with the six other leading dye companies of Germany on\r\nJanuary 1, 1916, to form a trust to last for fifty years. During this\r\ntime they will maintain uniform prices and uniform wage scales and hours\r\nof labor, and exchange patents and secrets. They will divide the foreign\r\nbusiness _pro rata_ and share the profits. The German chemical works\r\nmade big profits during the war, mostly from munitions and medicines,\r\nand will be, through this new combination, in a stronger position than\r\never to push the export trade.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of letting the dye business get away from her, England\r\nfound herself in a fix when war broke out. She did not have dyes for her\r\nuniforms and flags, and she did not have drugs for her wounded. She\r\ncould not take advantage of the blockade to capture the German trade in\r\nAsia and South America, because she could not color her textiles. A blue\r\ncotton dyestuff that sold before the war at sixty cents a pound, brought\r\n$34 a pound. A bright pink rhodamine formerly quoted at a dollar a pound\r\njumped to $48. When one keg of dye ordinarily worth $15 was put up at\r\nforced auction sale in 1915 it was knocked down at $1500. The\r\nHighlanders could not get the colors for their kilts until some German\r\ndyes were smuggled into England. The textile industries of Great\r\nBritain, that brought in a billion dollars a year and employed one and a\r\nhalf million workers, were crippled for lack of dyes. The demand for\r\nhigh explosives from the front could not be met because these also are\r\nlargely coal-tar products. Picric acid is both a dye and an explosive.\r\nIt is made from carbolic acid and the famous trinitrotoluene is made\r\nfrom toluene, both of which you will find in the list of the ten\r\nfundamental \"crudes.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Great Britain and the United States realized the danger of allowing\r\nGermany to recover her former monopoly, and both have shown a readiness\r\nto cast overboard their traditional policies to meet this emergency. The\r\nBritish Government has discovered that a country without a tariff is a\r\nland without walls. The American Government has discovered that an\r\nindustry is not benefited by being cut up into small pieces. Both\r\ngovernments are now doing all they can to build up big concerns and to\r\nprovide them with protection. The British Government assisted in the\r\nformation of a national company for the manufacture of synthetic dyes by\r\ntaking one-sixth of the stock and providing $500,000 for a research\r\nlaboratory. But this effort is now reported to be \"a great failure\"\r\nbecause the Government put it in charge of the politicians instead of\r\nthe chemists.\r\n\r\nThe United States, like England, had become dependent upon Germany for\r\nits dyestuffs. We imported nine-tenths of what we used and most of those\r\nthat were produced here were made from imported intermediates. When the\r\nwar broke out there were only seven firms and 528 persons employed in\r\nthe manufacture of dyes in the United States. One of these, the\r\nSchoelkopf Aniline and Chemical Works, of Buffalo, deserves mention, for\r\nit had stuck it out ever since 1879, and in 1914 was making 106 dyes. In\r\nJune, 1917, this firm, with the encouragement of the Government Bureau\r\nof Foreign and Domestic Commerce, joined with some of the other American\r\nproducers to form a trade combination, the National Aniline and Chemical\r\nCompany. The Du Pont Company also entered the field on an extensive\r\nscale and soon there were 118 concerns engaged in it with great profit.\r\nDuring the war $200,000,000 was invested in the domestic dyestuff\r\nindustry. To protect this industry Congress put on a specific duty of\r\nfive cents a pound and an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent. on imported\r\ndyestuffs; but if, after five years, American manufacturers are not\r\nproducing 60 per cent. in value of the domestic consumption, the\r\nprotection is to be removed. For some reason, not clearly understood and\r\ntherefore hotly discussed, Congress at the last moment struck off the\r\nspecific duty from two of the most important of the dyestuffs, indigo\r\nand alizarin, as well as from all medicinals and flavors.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of dyes is not a big business, but it is a strategic\r\nbusiness. Heligoland is not a big island, but England would have been\r\nglad to buy it back during the war at a high price per square yard.\r\nAmerican industries employing over two million men and women and\r\nproducing over three billion dollars' worth of products a year are\r\ndependent upon dyes. Chief of these is of course textiles, using more\r\nthan half the dyes; next come leather, paper, paint and ink. We have\r\nbeen importing more than $12,000,000 worth of coal-tar products a year,\r\nbut the cottonseed oil we exported in 1912 would alone suffice to pay\r\nthat bill twice over. But although the manufacture of dyes cannot be\r\ncalled a big business, in comparison with some others, it is a paying\r\nbusiness when well managed. The German concerns paid on an average 22\r\nper cent. dividends on their capital and sometimes as high as 50 per\r\ncent. Most of the standard dyes have been so long in use that the\r\npatents are off and the processes are well enough known. We have the\r\ncoal tar and we have the chemists, so there seems no good reason why we\r\nshould not make our own dyes, at least enough of them so we will not be\r\ncaught napping as we were in 1914. It was decidedly humiliating for our\r\nGovernment to have to beg Germany to sell us enough colors to print our\r\nstamps and greenbacks and then have to beg Great Britain for permission\r\nto bring them over by Dutch ships.\r\n\r\nThe raw material for the production of coal-tar products we have in\r\nabundance if we will only take the trouble to save it. In 1914 the crude\r\nlight oil collected from the coke-ovens would have produced only about\r\n4,500,000 gallons of benzol and 1,500,000 gallons of toluol, but in 1917\r\nthis output was raised to 40,200,000 gallons of benzol and 10,200,000 of\r\ntoluol. The toluol was used mostly in the manufacture of trinitrotoluol\r\nfor use in Europe. When the war broke out in 1914 it shut off our supply\r\nof phenol (carbolic acid) for which we were dependent upon foreign\r\nsources. This threatened not only to afflict us with headaches by\r\ndepriving us of aspirin but also to removed the consolation of music,\r\nfor phenol is used in making phonographic records. Mr. Edison with his\r\naccustomed energy put up a factory within a few weeks for the\r\nmanufacture of synthetic phenol. When we entered the war the need for\r\nphenol became yet more imperative, for it was needed to make picric\r\nacid for filling bombs. This demand was met, and in 1917 there were\r\nfifteen new plants turning out 64,146,499 pounds of phenol valued at\r\n$23,719,805.\r\n\r\nSome of the coal-tar products, as we see, serve many purposes. For\r\ninstance, picric acid appears in three places in this book. It is a high\r\nexplosive. It is a powerful and permanent yellow dye as any one who has\r\ntouched it knows. Thirdly it is used as an antiseptic to cover burned\r\nskin. Other coal-tar dyes are used for the same purpose, \"malachite\r\ngreen,\" \"brilliant green,\" \"crystal violet,\" \"ethyl violet\" and\r\n\"Victoria blue,\" so a patient in a military hospital is decorated like\r\nan Easter egg. During the last five years surgeons have unfortunately\r\nhad unprecedented opportunities for the study of wounds and fortunately\r\nthey have been unprecedentedly successful in finding improved methods of\r\ntreating them. In former wars a serious wound meant usually death or\r\namputation. Now nearly ninety per cent. of the wounded are able to\r\ncontinue in the service. The reason for this improvement is that\r\nmedicines are now being made to order instead of being gathered \"from\r\nChina to Peru.\" The old herb doctor picked up any strange plant that he\r\ncould find and tried it on any sick man that would let him. This\r\nempirical method, though hard on the patients, resulted in the course of\r\nfive thousand years in the discovery of a number of useful remedies. But\r\nthe modern medicine man when he knows the cause of the disease is\r\nusually able to devise ways of counteracting it directly. For instance,\r\nhe knows, thanks to Pasteur and Metchnikoff, that the cause of wound\r\ninfection is the bacterial enemies of man which swarm by the million\r\ninto any breach in his protective armor, the skin. Now when a breach is\r\nmade in a line of intrenchments the defenders rush troops to the\r\nthreatened spot for two purposes, constructive and destructive,\r\nengineers and warriors, the former to build up the rampart with\r\nsandbags, the latter to kill the enemy. So when the human body is\r\ninvaded the blood brings to the breach two kinds of defenders. One is\r\nthe serum which neutralizes the bacterial poison and by coagulating\r\nforms a new skin or scab over the exposed flesh. The other is the\r\nphagocytes or white corpuscles, the free lances of our corporeal\r\nmilitia, which attack and kill the invading bacteria. The aim of the\r\nphysician then is to aid these defenders as much as possible without\r\ninterfering with them. Therefore the antiseptic he is seeking is one\r\nthat will assist the serum in protecting and repairing the broken\r\ntissues and will kill the hostile bacteria without killing the friendly\r\nphagocytes. Carbolic acid, the most familiar of the coal-tar\r\nantiseptics, will destroy the bacteria when it is diluted with 250 parts\r\nof water, but unfortunately it puts a stop to the fighting activities of\r\nthe phagocytes when it is only half that strength, or one to 500, so it\r\ncannot destroy the infection without hindering the healing.\r\n\r\nIn this search for substances that would attack a specific disease germ\r\none of the leading investigators was Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a German\r\nphysician of the Hebrew race. He found that the aniline dyes were useful\r\nfor staining slides under the microscope, for they would pick out\r\nparticular cells and leave others uncolored and from this starting point\r\nhe worked out organic and metallic compounds which would destroy the\r\nbacteria and parasites that cause some of the most dreadful of diseases.\r\nA year after the war broke out Professor Ehrlich died while working in\r\nhis laboratory on how to heal with coal-tar compounds the wounds\r\ninflicted by explosives from the same source.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable of the aniline antiseptics employed by Ehrlich\r\nis flavine or, if the reader prefers to call it by its full name,\r\ndiaminomethylacridinium chloride. Flavine, as its name implies, is a\r\nyellow dye and will kill the germs causing ordinary abscesses when in\r\nsolution as dilute as one part of the dye to 200,000 parts of water, but\r\nit does not interfere with the bactericidal action of the white blood\r\ncorpuscles unless the solution is 400 times as strong as this, that is\r\none part in 500. Unlike carbolic acid and other antiseptics it is said\r\nto stimulate the serum instead of impairing its activity. Another\r\nantiseptic of the coal-tar family which has recently been brought into\r\nuse by Dr. Dakin of the Rockefeller Institute is that called by European\r\nphysicians chloramine-T and by American physicians chlorazene and by\r\nchemists para-toluene-sodium-sulfo-chloramide.\r\n\r\nThis may serve to illustrate how a chemist is able to make such remedies\r\nas the doctor needs, instead of depending upon the accidental\r\nby-products of plants. On an earlier page I explained how by starting\r\nwith the simplest of ring-compounds, the benzene of coal tar, we could\r\nget aniline. Suppose we go a step further and boil the aniline oil with\r\nacetic acid, which is the acid of vinegar minus its water. This easy\r\nprocess gives us acetanilid, which when introduced into the market some\r\nyears ago under the name of \"antifebrin\" made a fortune for its makers.\r\n\r\nThe making of medicines from coal tar began in 1874 when Kolbe made\r\nsalicylic acid from carbolic acid. Salicylic acid is a rheumatism remedy\r\nand had previously been extracted from willow bark. If now we treat\r\nsalicylic acid with concentrated acetic acid we get \"aspirin.\" From\r\naniline again are made \"phenacetin,\" \"antipyrin\" and a lot of other\r\ndrugs that have become altogether too popular as headache remedies--say\r\nrather \"headache relievers.\"\r\n\r\nAnother class of synthetics equally useful and likewise abused, are the\r\nsoporifics, such as \"sulphonal,\" \"veronal\" and \"medinal.\" When it is not\r\ndesired to put the patient to sleep but merely to render insensible a\r\nparticular place, as when a tooth is to be pulled, cocain may be used.\r\nThis, like alcohol and morphine, has proved a curse as well as a\r\nblessing and its sale has had to be restricted because of the many\r\nvictims to the habit of using this drug. Cocain is obtained from the\r\nleaves of the South American coca tree, but can be made artificially\r\nfrom coal-tar products. The laboratory is superior to the forest because\r\nother forms of local anesthetics, such as eucain and novocain, can be\r\nmade that are better than the natural alkaloid because more effective\r\nand less poisonous.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention another lot of coal-tar derivatives in\r\nwhich some of my readers will take a personal interest. That is the\r\nphotographic developers. I am old enough to remember when we used to\r\ndevelop our plates in ferrous sulfate solution and you never saw nicer\r\nnegatives than we got with it. But when pyrogallic acid came in we\r\nswitched over to that even though it did stain our fingers and sometimes\r\nour plates. Later came a swarm of new organic reducing agents under\r\nvarious fancy names, such as metol, hydro (short for hydro-quinone) and\r\neikongen (\"the image-maker\"). Every fellow fixed up his own formula and\r\ncalled his fellow-members of the camera club fools for not adopting it\r\nthough he secretly hoped they would not.\r\n\r\nUnder the double stimulus of patriotism and high prices the American\r\ndrug and dyestuff industry developed rapidly. In 1917 about as many\r\npounds of dyes were manufactured in America as were imported in 1913 and\r\nour _exports_ of American-made dyes exceeded in value our _imports_\r\nbefore the war. In 1914 the output of American dyes was valued at\r\n$2,500,000. In 1917 it amounted to over $57,000,000. This does not mean\r\nthat the problem was solved, for the home products were not equal in\r\nvariety and sometimes not in quality to those made in Germany. Many\r\nvaluable dyes were lacking and the cost was of course much higher.\r\nWhether the American industry can compete with the foreign in an open\r\nmarket and on equal terms is impossible to say because such conditions\r\ndid not prevail before the war and they are not going to prevail in the\r\nfuture. Formerly the large German cartels through their agents and\r\nbranches in this country kept the business in their own hands and now\r\nthe American manufacturers are determined to maintain the independence\r\nthey have acquired. They will not depend hereafter upon the tariff to\r\ncut off competition but have adopted more effective measures. The 4500\r\nGerman chemical patents that had been seized by the Alien Property\r\nCustodian were sold by him for $250,000 to the Chemical Foundation, an\r\nassociation of American manufacturers organized \"for the Americanization\r\nof such institutions as may be affected thereby, for the exclusion or\r\nelimination of alien interests hostile or detrimental to said industries\r\nand for the advancement of chemical and allied science and industry in\r\nthe United States.\" The Foundation has a large fighting fund so that it\r\n\"may be able to commence immediately and prosecute with the utmost vigor\r\ninfringement proceedings whenever the first German attempt shall\r\nhereafter be made to import into this country.\"\r\n\r\nSo much mystery has been made of the achievements of German chemists--as\r\nthough the Teutonic brain had a special lobe for that faculty, lacking\r\nin other craniums--that I want to quote what Dr. Hesse says about his\r\nfirst impressions of a German laboratory of industrial research:\r\n\r\n     Directly after graduating from the University of Chicago in\r\n     1896, I entered the employ of the largest coal-tar dye works in\r\n     the world at its plant in Germany and indeed in one of its\r\n     research laboratories. This was my first trip outside the\r\n     United States and it was, of course, an event of the first\r\n     magnitude for me to be in Europe, and, as a chemist, to be in\r\n     Germany, in a German coal-tar dye plant, and to cap it all in\r\n     its research laboratory--a real _sanctum sanctorum_ for\r\n     chemists. In a short time the daily routine wore the novelty\r\n     off my experience and I then settled down to calm analysis and\r\n     dispassionate appraisal of my surroundings and to compare what\r\n     was actually before and around me with my expectations. I\r\n     found that the general laboratory equipment was no better than\r\n     what I had been accustomed to; that my colleagues had no better\r\n     fundamental training than I had enjoyed nor any better fact--or\r\n     manipulative--equipment than I; that those in charge of the\r\n     work had no better general intellectual equipment nor any more\r\n     native ability than had my instructors; in short, there was\r\n     nothing new about it all, nothing that we did not have back\r\n     home, nothing--except the specific problems that were engaging\r\n     their attention, and the special opportunities of attacking\r\n     them. Those problems were of no higher order of complexity than\r\n     those I had been accustomed to for years, in fact, most of them\r\n     were not very complex from a purely intellectual viewpoint.\r\n     There was nothing inherently uncanny, magical or wizardly about\r\n     their occupation whatever. It was nothing but plain hard work\r\n     and keeping everlastingly at it. Now, what was the actual thing\r\n     behind that chemical laboratory that we did not have at home?\r\n     It was money, willing to back such activity, convinced that in\r\n     the final outcome, a profit would be made; money, willing to\r\n     take university graduates expecting from them no special\r\n     knowledge other than a good and thorough grounding in\r\n     scientific research and provide them with opportunity to become\r\n     specialists suited to the factory's needs.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently not impossible to make the United States self-sufficient\r\nin the matter of coal-tar products. We've got the tar; we've got the\r\nmen; we've got the money, too. Whether such a policy would pay us in the\r\nlong run or whether it is necessary as a measure of military or\r\ncommercial self-defense is another question that cannot here be decided.\r\nBut whatever share we may have in it the coal-tar industry has increased\r\nthe economy of civilization and added to the wealth of the world by\r\nshowing how a waste by-product could be utilized for making new dyes and\r\nvaluable medicines, a better use for tar than as fuel for political\r\nbonfires and as clothing for the nakedness of social outcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSYNTHETIC PERFUMES AND FLAVORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primitive man got his living out of such wild plants and animals as\r\nhe could find. Next he, or more likely his wife, began to cultivate the\r\nplants and tame the animals so as to insure a constant supply. This was\r\nthe first step toward civilization, for when men had to settle down in a\r\ncommunity (_civitas_) they had to ameliorate their manners and make laws\r\nprotecting land and property. In this settled and orderly life the\r\nplants and animals improved as well as man and returned a hundredfold\r\nfor the pains that their master had taken in their training. But still\r\nman was dependent upon the chance bounties of nature. He could select,\r\nbut he could not invent. He could cultivate, but he could not create. If\r\nhe wanted sugar he had to send to the West Indies. If he wanted spices\r\nhe had to send to the East Indies. If he wanted indigo he had to send to\r\nIndia. If he wanted a febrifuge he had to send to Peru. If he wanted a\r\nfertilizer he had to send to Chile. If he wanted rubber he had to send\r\nto the Congo. If he wanted rubies he had to send to Mandalay. If he\r\nwanted otto of roses he had to send to Turkey. Man was not yet master of\r\nhis environment.\r\n\r\nThis period of cultivation, the second stage of civilization, began\r\nbefore the dawn of history and lasted until recent times. We might\r\nalmost say up to the twentieth century, for it was not until the\r\nfundamental laws of heredity were discovered that man could originate\r\nnew species of plants and animals according to a predetermined plan by\r\ncombining such characteristics as he desired to perpetuate. And it was\r\nnot until the fundamental laws of chemistry were discovered that man\r\ncould originate new compounds more suitable to his purpose than any to\r\nbe found in nature. Since the progress of mankind is continuous it is\r\nimpossible to draw a date line, unless a very jagged one, along the\r\nfrontier of human culture, but it is evident that we are just entering\r\nupon the third era of evolution in which man will make what he needs\r\ninstead of trying to find it somewhere. The new epoch has hardly dawned,\r\nyet already a man may stay at home in New York or London and make his\r\nown rubber and rubies, his own indigo and otto of roses. More than this,\r\nhe can make gems and colors and perfumes that never existed since time\r\nbegan. The man of science has signed a declaration of independence of\r\nthe lower world and we are now in the midst of the revolution.\r\n\r\nOur eyes are dazzled by the dawn of the new era. We know what the hunter\r\nand the horticulturist have already done for man, but we cannot imagine\r\nwhat the chemist can do. If we look ahead through the eyes of one of the\r\ngreatest of French chemists, Berthelot, this is what we shall see:\r\n\r\n     The problem of food is a chemical problem. Whenever energy can\r\n     be obtained economically we can begin to make all kinds of\r\n     aliment, with carbon borrowed from carbonic acid, hydrogen\r\n     taken from the water and oxygen and nitrogen drawn from the\r\n     air.... The day will come when each person will carry for his\r\n     nourishment his little nitrogenous tablet, his pat of fatty\r\n     matter, his package of starch or sugar, his vial of aromatic\r\n     spices suited to his personal taste; all manufactured\r\n     economically and in unlimited quantities; all independent of\r\n     irregular seasons, drought and rain, of the heat that withers\r\n     the plant and of the frost that blights the fruit; all free\r\n     from pathogenic microbes, the origin of epidemics and the\r\n     enemies of human life. On that day chemistry will have\r\n     accomplished a world-wide revolution that cannot be estimated.\r\n     There will no longer be hills covered with vineyards and fields\r\n     filled with cattle. Man will gain in gentleness and morality\r\n     because he will cease to live by the carnage and destruction of\r\n     living creatures.... The earth will be covered with grass,\r\n     flowers and woods and in it the human race will dwell in the\r\n     abundance and joy of the legendary age of gold--provided that a\r\n     spiritual chemistry has been discovered that changes the nature\r\n     of man as profoundly as our chemistry transforms material\r\n     nature.\r\n\r\nBut this is looking so far into the future that we can trust no man's\r\neyesight, not even Berthelot's. There is apparently no impossibility\r\nabout the manufacture of synthetic food, but at present there is no\r\napparent probability of it. There is no likelihood that the laboratory\r\nwill ever rival the wheat field. The cornstalk will always be able to\r\nwork cheaper than the chemist in the manufacture of starch. But in rarer\r\nand choicer products of nature the chemist has proved his ability to\r\ncompete and even to excel.\r\n\r\nWhat have been from the dawn of history to the rise of synthetic\r\nchemistry the most costly products of nature? What could tempt a\r\nmerchant to brave the perils of a caravan journey over the deserts of\r\nAsia beset with Arab robbers? What induced the Portuguese and Spanish\r\nmariners to risk their frail barks on perilous waters of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope or the Horn? The chief prizes were perfumes, spices, drugs and\r\ngems. And why these rather than what now constitutes the bulk of oversea\r\nand overland commerce? Because they were precious, portable and\r\nimperishable. If the merchant got back safe after a year or two with a\r\nlittle flask of otto of roses, a package of camphor and a few pearls\r\nconcealed in his garments his fortune was made. If a single ship of the\r\nargosy sent out from Lisbon came back with a load of sandalwood, indigo\r\nor nutmeg it was regarded as a successful venture. You know from reading\r\nthe Bible, or if not that, from your reading of Arabian Nights, that a\r\nfew grains of frankincense or a few drops of perfumed oil were regarded\r\nas gifts worthy the acceptance of a king or a god. These products of the\r\nOrient were equally in demand by the toilet and the temple. The\r\nunctorium was an adjunct of the Roman bathroom. Kings had to be greased\r\nand fumigated before they were thought fit to sit upon a throne. There\r\nwas a theory, not yet altogether extinct, that medicines brought from a\r\ndistance were most efficacious, especially if, besides being expensive,\r\nthey tasted bad like myrrh or smelled bad like asafetida. And if these\r\nfailed to save the princely patient he was embalmed in aromatics or, as\r\nwe now call them, antiseptics of the benzene series.\r\n\r\nToday, as always, men are willing to pay high for the titillation of the\r\nsenses of smell and taste. The African savage will trade off an ivory\r\ntusk for a piece of soap reeking with synthetic musk. The clubman will\r\npay $10 for a bottle of wine which consists mostly of water with about\r\nten per cent. of alcohol, worth a cent or two, but contains an\r\nunweighable amount of the \"bouquet\" that can only be produced on the\r\nsunny slopes of Champagne or in the valley of the Rhine. But very likely\r\nthe reader is quite as extravagant, for when one buys the natural violet\r\nperfumery he is paying at the rate of more than $10,000 a pound for the\r\nodoriferous oil it contains; the rest is mere water and alcohol. But you\r\nwould not want the pure undiluted oil if you could get it, for it is\r\nunendurable. A single whiff of it paralyzes your sense of smell for a\r\ntime just as a loud noise deafens you.\r\n\r\nOf the five senses, three are physical and two chemical. By touch we\r\ndiscern pressures and surface textures. By hearing we receive\r\nimpressions of certain air waves and by sight of certain ether waves.\r\nBut smell and taste lead us to the heart of the molecule and enable us\r\nto tell how the atoms are put together. These twin senses stand like\r\nsentries at the portals of the body, where they closely scrutinize\r\neverything that enters. Sounds and sights may be disagreeable, but they\r\nare never fatal. A man can live in a boiler factory or in a cubist art\r\ngallery, but he cannot live in a room containing hydrogen sulfide. Since\r\nit is more important to be warned of danger than guided to delights our\r\nsenses are made more sensitive to pain than pleasure. We can detect by\r\nthe smell one two-millionth of a milligram of oil of roses or musk, but\r\nwe can detect one two-billionth of a milligram of mercaptan, which is\r\nthe vilest smelling compound that man has so far invented. If you do not\r\nknow how much a milligram is consider a drop picked up by the point of\r\na needle and imagine that divided into two billion parts. Also try to\r\nestimate the weight of the odorous particles that guide a dog to the fox\r\nor warn a deer of the presence of man. The unaided nostril can rival the\r\nspectroscope in the detection and analysis of unweighable amounts of\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWhat we call flavor or savor is a joint effect of taste and odor in\r\nwhich the latter predominates. There are only four tastes of importance,\r\nacid, alkaline, bitter and sweet. The acid, or sour taste, is the\r\nperception of hydrogen atoms charged with positive electricity. The\r\nalkaline, or soapy taste, is the perception of hydroxyl radicles charged\r\nwith negative electricity. The bitter and sweet tastes and all the odors\r\ndepend upon the chemical constitution of the compound, but the laws of\r\nthe relation have not yet been worked out. Since these sense organs, the\r\ntaste and smell buds, are sunk in the moist mucous membrane they can\r\nonly be touched by substances soluble in water, and to reach the sense\r\nof smell they must also be volatile so as to be diffused in the air\r\ninhaled by the nose. The \"taste\" of food is mostly due to the volatile\r\nodors of it that creep up the back-stairs into the olfactory chamber.\r\n\r\nA chemist given an unknown substance would have to make an elementary\r\nanalysis and some tedious tests to determine whether it contained methyl\r\nor ethyl groups, whether it was an aldehyde or an ester, whether the\r\ncarbon atoms were singly or doubly linked and whether it was an open\r\nchain or closed. But let him get a whiff of it and he can give instantly\r\na pretty shrewd guess as to these points. His nose knows.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chemist does not yet know enough to tell for certain from\r\nlooking at the structural formula what sort of odor the compound would\r\nhave or whether it would have any, yet we can divide odoriferous\r\nsubstances into classes according to their constitution. What are\r\ncommonly known as \"fruity\" odors belong mostly to what the chemist calls\r\nthe fatty or aliphatic series. For instance, we may have in a ripe fruit\r\nan alcohol (say ethyl or common alcohol) and an acid (say acetic or\r\nvinegar) and a combination of these, the ester or organic salt (in this\r\ncase ethyl acetate), which is more odorous than either of its\r\ncomponents. These esters of the fatty acids give the characteristic\r\nsavor to many of our favorite fruits, candies and beverages. The pear\r\nflavor, amyl acetate, is made from acetic acid and amyl alcohol--though\r\namyl alcohol (fusel oil) has a detestable smell. Pineapple is ethyl\r\nbutyrate--but the acid part of it (butyric acid) is what gives Limburger\r\ncheese its aroma. These essential oils are easily made in the\r\nlaboratory, but cannot be extracted from the fruit for separate use.\r\n\r\nIf the carbon chain contains one or more double linkages we get the\r\n\"flowery\" perfumes. For instance, here is the symbol of geraniol, the\r\nchief ingredient of otto of roses:\r\n\r\n  (CH_{3})_{2}C = CHCH_{2}CH_{2}C(CH_{3})_{2} = CHCH_{2}OH\r\n\r\nThe rose would smell as sweet under another name, but it may be\r\nquestioned whether it would stand being called by the name of\r\ndimethyl-2-6-octadiene-2-6-ol-8. Geraniol by oxidation goes into the\r\naldehyde, citral, which occurs in lemons, oranges and verbena flowers.\r\nAnother compound of this group, linalool, is found in lavender, bergamot\r\nand many flowers.\r\n\r\nGeraniol, as you would see if you drew up its structural formula in the\r\nway I described in the last chapter, contains a chain of six carbon\r\natoms, that is, the same number as make a benzene ring. Now if we shake\r\nup geraniol and other compounds of this group (the diolefines) with\r\ndiluted sulfuric acid the carbon chain hooks up to form a benzene ring,\r\nbut with the other carbon atoms stretched across it; rather too\r\ncomplicated to depict here. These \"bridged rings\" of the formula\r\nC_{5}H_{8}, or some multiple of that, constitute the important group of\r\nthe terpenes which occur in turpentine and such wild and woodsy things\r\nas sage, lavender, caraway, pine needles and eucalyptus. Going further\r\nin this direction we are led into the realm of the heavy oriental odors,\r\npatchouli, sandalwood, cedar, cubebs, ginger and camphor. Camphor can\r\nnow be made directly from turpentine so we may be independent of Formosa\r\nand Borneo.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a six carbon ring without double linkings (cyclo-aliphatic)\r\nor with one or two such, we get soft and delicate perfumes like the\r\nviolet (ionone and irone). But when these pass into the benzene ring\r\nwith its three double linkages the odor becomes more powerful and so\r\ncharacteristic that the name \"aromatic compound\" has been extended to\r\nthe entire class of benzene derivatives, although many of them are\r\nodorless. The essential oils of jasmine, orange blossoms, musk,\r\nheliotrope, tuberose, ylang ylang, etc., consist mostly of this class\r\nand can be made from the common source of aromatic compounds, coal tar.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic flavors and perfumes are made in the same way as the dyes\r\nby starting with some coal-tar product or other crude material and\r\nbuilding up the molecule to the desired complexity. For instance, let us\r\nstart with phenol, the ill-smelling and poisonous carbolic acid of\r\ndisagreeable associations and evil fame. Treat this to soda-water and it\r\nis transformed into salicylic acid, a white odorless powder, used as a\r\npreservative and as a rheumatism remedy. Add to this methyl alcohol\r\nwhich is obtained by the destructive distillation of wood and is much\r\nmore poisonous than ordinary ethyl alcohol. The alcohol and the acid\r\nheated together will unite with the aid of a little sulfuric acid and we\r\nget what the chemist calls methyl salicylate and other people call oil\r\nof wintergreen, the same as is found in wintergreen berries and birch\r\nbark. We have inherited a taste for this from our pioneer ancestors and\r\nwe use it extensively to flavor our soft drinks, gum, tooth paste and\r\ncandy, but the Europeans have not yet found out how nice it is.\r\n\r\nBut, starting with phenol again, let us heat it with caustic alkali and\r\nchloroform. This gives us two new compounds of the same composition, but\r\ndiffering a little in the order of the atoms. If you refer back to the\r\ndiagram of the benzene ring which I gave in the last chapter, you will\r\nsee that there are six hydrogen atoms attached to it. Now any or all\r\nthese hydrogen atoms may be replaced by other elements or groups and\r\nwhat the product is depends not only on what the new elements are, but\r\nwhere they are put. It is like spelling words. The three letters _t_,\r\n_r_ and _a_ mean very different things according to whether they are put\r\ntogether as _art_, _tar_ or _rat_. Or, to take a more apposite\r\nillustration, every hostess knows that the success of her dinner depends\r\nupon how she seats her guests around the table. So in the case of\r\naromatic compounds, a little difference in the seating arrangement\r\naround the benzene ring changes the character. The two derivatives of\r\nphenol, which we are now considering, have two substituting groups. One\r\nis--O-H (called the hydroxyl group). The other is--CHO (called the\r\naldehyde group). If these are opposite (called the para position) we\r\nhave an odorless white solid. If they are side by side (called the ortho\r\nposition) we have an oil with the odor of meadowsweet. Treating the\r\nodorless solid with methyl alcohol we get audepine (or anisic aldehyde)\r\nwhich is the perfume of hawthorn blossoms. But treating the other of the\r\ntwin products, the fragrant oil, with dry acetic acid (\"Perkin's\r\nreaction\") we get cumarin, which is the perfume part of the tonka or\r\ntonquin beans that our forefathers used to carry in their snuff boxes.\r\nOne ounce of cumarin is equal to four pounds of tonka beans. It smells\r\nsufficiently like vanilla to be used as a substitute for it in cheap\r\nextracts. In perfumery it is known as \"new mown hay.\"\r\n\r\nYou may remember what I said on a former page about the career of\r\nWilliam Henry Perkin, the boy who loved chemistry better than eating,\r\nand how he discovered the coal-tar dyes. Well, it is also to his\r\ningenious mind that we owe the starting of the coal-tar perfume business\r\nwhich has had almost as important a development. Perkin made cumarin in\r\n1868, but this, like the dye industry, escaped from English hands and\r\nflew over the North Sea. Before the war Germany was exporting\r\n$1,500,000 worth of synthetic perfumes a year. Part of these went to\r\nFrance, where they were mixed and put up in fancy bottles with French\r\nnames and sold to Americans at fancy prices.\r\n\r\nThe real vanilla flavor, vanillin, was made by Tiemann in 1874. At first\r\nit sold for nearly $800 a pound, but now it may be had for $10. How\r\nextensively it is now used in chocolate, ice cream, soda water, cakes\r\nand the like we all know. It should be noted that cumarin and vanillin,\r\nhowever they may be made, are not imitations, but identical with the\r\nchief constituent of the tonka and vanilla beans and, of course, are\r\nequally wholesome or harmless. But the nice palate can distinguish a\r\nricher flavor in the natural extracts, for they contain small quantities\r\nof other savory ingredients.\r\n\r\nA true perfume consists of a large number of odoriferous chemical\r\ncompounds mixed in such proportions as to produce a single harmonious\r\neffect upon the sense of smell in a fine brand of perfume may be\r\ncompounded a dozen or twenty different ingredients and these, if they\r\nare natural essences, are complex mixtures of a dozen or so distinct\r\nsubstances. Perfumery is one of the fine arts. The perfumer, like the\r\norchestra leader, must know how to combine and coördinate his\r\ninstruments to produce a desired sensation. A Wagnerian opera requires\r\n103 musicians. A Strauss opera requires 112. Now if the concert manager\r\nwants to economize he will insist upon cutting down on the most\r\nexpensive musicians and dropping out some of the others, say, the\r\nsupernumerary violinists and the man who blows a single blast or tinkles\r\na triangle once in the course of the evening. Only the trained ear will\r\ndetect the difference and the manager can make more money.\r\n\r\nSuppose our mercenary impresario were unable to get into the concert\r\nhall of his famous rival. He would then listen outside the window and\r\nanalyze the sound in this fashion: \"Fifty per cent. of the sound is made\r\nby the tuba, 20 per cent. by the bass drum, 15 per cent. by the 'cello\r\nand 10 per cent. by the clarinet. There are some other instruments, but\r\nthey are not loud and I guess if we can leave them out nobody will know\r\nthe difference.\" So he makes up his orchestra out of these four alone\r\nand many people do not know the difference.\r\n\r\nThe cheap perfumer goes about it in the same way. He analyzes, for\r\ninstance, the otto or oil of roses which cost during the war $400 a\r\npound--if you could get it at any price--and he finds that the chief\r\ningredient is geraniol, costing only $5, and next is citronelol, costing\r\n$20; then comes nerol and others. So he makes up a cheap brand of\r\nperfumery out of three or four such compounds. But the genuine oil of\r\nroses, like other natural essences, contains a dozen or more\r\nconstituents and to leave many of them out is like reducing an orchestra\r\nto a few loud-sounding instruments or a painting to a three-color print.\r\nA few years ago an attempt was made to make music electrically by\r\nproducing separately each kind of sound vibration contained in the\r\ninstruments imitated. Theoretically that seems easy, but practically the\r\ntone was not satisfactory because the tones and overtones of a full\r\norchestra or even of a single violin are too numerous and complex to be\r\nreproduced individually. So the synthetic perfumes have not driven out\r\nthe natural perfumes, but, on the contrary, have aided and stimulated\r\nthe growth of flowers for essences. The otto or attar of roses, favorite\r\nof the Persian monarchs and romances, has in recent years come chiefly\r\nfrom Bulgaria. But wars are not made with rosewater and the Bulgars for\r\nthe last five years have been engaged in other business than cultivating\r\ntheir own gardens. The alembic or still was invented by the Arabian\r\nalchemists for the purpose of obtaining the essential oil or attar of\r\nroses. But distillation, even with the aid of steam, is not altogether\r\nsatisfactory. For instance, the distilled rose oil contains anywhere\r\nfrom 10 to 74 per cent. of a paraffin wax (stearopten) that is odorless\r\nand, on the other hand, phenyl-ethyl alcohol, which is an important\r\nconstituent of the scent of roses, is broken up in the process of\r\ndistillation. So the perfumer can improve on the natural or rather the\r\ndistilled oil by leaving out part of the paraffin and adding the missing\r\nalcohol. Even the imported article taken direct from the still is not\r\nalways genuine, for the wily Bulgar sometimes \"increases the yield\" by\r\nsprinkling his roses in the vat with synthetic geraniol just as the wily\r\nItalian pours a barrel of American cottonseed oil over his olives in the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nAnother method of extracting the scent of flowers is by _enfleurage_,\r\nwhich takes advantage of the tendency of fats to absorb odors. You know\r\nhow butter set beside fish in the ice box will get a fishy flavor. In\r\n_enfleurage_ moist air is carried up a tower passing alternately over\r\ntrays of fresh flowers, say violets, and over glass plates covered with\r\na thin layer of lard. The perfumed lard may then be used as a pomade or\r\nthe perfume may be extracted by alcohol.\r\n\r\nBut many sweet flowers do not readily yield an essential oil, so in such\r\noases we have to rely altogether upon more or less successful\r\nsubstitutes. For instance, the perfumes sold under the names of\r\n\"heliotrope,\" \"lily of the valley,\" \"lilac,\" \"cyclamen,\" \"honeysuckle,\"\r\n\"sweet pea,\" \"arbutus,\" \"mayflower\" and \"magnolia\" are not produced from\r\nthese flowers but are simply imitations made from other essences,\r\nsynthetic or natural. Among the \"thousand flowers\" that contribute to\r\nthe \"Eau de Mille Fleurs\" are the civet cat, the musk deer and the sperm\r\nwhale. Some of the published formulas for \"Jockey Club\" call for civet\r\nor ambergris and those of \"Lavender Water\" for musk and civet. The less\r\nsaid about the origin of these three animal perfumes the better.\r\nFortunately they are becoming too expensive to use and are being\r\ndisplaced by synthetic products more agreeable to a refined imagination.\r\nThe musk deer may now be saved from extinction since we can make\r\ntri-nitro-butyl-xylene from coal tar. This synthetic musk passes muster\r\nto human nostrils, but a cat will turn up her nose at it. The synthetic\r\nmusk is not only much cheaper than the natural, but a dozen times as\r\nstrong, or let us say, goes a dozen times as far, for nobody wants it\r\nany stronger.\r\n\r\nSuch powerful scents as these are only pleasant when highly diluted, yet\r\nthey are, as we have seen, essential ingredients of the finest perfumes.\r\nFor instance, the natural oil of jasmine and other flowers contain\r\ntraces of indols and skatols which have most disgusting odors. Though\r\nour olfactory organs cannot detect their presence yet we perceive their\r\nabsence so they have to be put into the artificial perfume. Just so a\r\nbrief but violent discord in a piece of music or a glaring color\r\ncontrast in a painting may be necessary to the harmony of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to object to \"artificial\" perfumes, for practically all\r\nperfumes now sold are artificial in the sense of being compounded by the\r\nart of the perfumer and whether the materials he uses are derived from\r\nthe flowers of yesteryear or of Carboniferous Era is nobody's business\r\nbut his. And he does not tell. The materials can be purchased in the\r\nopen market. Various recipes can be found in the books. But every famous\r\nperfumer guards well the secret of his formulas and hands it as a legacy\r\nto his posterity. The ancient Roman family of Frangipani has been made\r\nimmortal by one such hereditary recipe. The Farina family still claims\r\nto have the exclusive knowledge of how to make Eau de Cologne. This\r\nfamous perfume was first compounded by an Italian, Giovanni Maria\r\nFarina, who came to Cologne in 1709. It soon became fashionable and was\r\nfor a time the only scent allowed at some of the German courts. The\r\nvarious published recipes contain from six to a dozen ingredients,\r\nchiefly the oils of neroli, rosemary, bergamot, lemon and lavender\r\ndissolved in very pure alcohol and allowed to age like wine. The\r\ninvention, in 1895, of artificial neroli (orange flowers) has improved\r\nthe product.\r\n\r\nFrench perfumery, like the German, had its origin in Italy, when\r\nCatherine de' Medici came to Paris as the bride of Henri II. She\r\nbrought with her, among other artists, her perfumer, Sieur Toubarelli,\r\nwho established himself in the flowery land of Grasse. Here for four\r\nhundred years the industry has remained rooted and the family formulas\r\nhave been handed down from generation to generation. In the city of\r\nGrasse there were at the outbreak of the war fifty establishments making\r\nperfumes. The French perfumer does not confine himself to a single\r\nsense. He appeals as well to sight and sound and association. He adds to\r\nthe attractiveness of his creation by a quaintly shaped bottle, an\r\nartistic box and an enticing name such as \"Dans les Nues,\" \"Le Coeur de\r\nJeannette,\" \"Nuit de Chine,\" \"Un Air Embaumé,\" \"Le Vertige,\" \"Bon Vieux\r\nTemps,\" \"L'Heure Bleue,\" \"Nuit d'Amour,\" \"Quelques Fleurs,\" \"Djer-Kiss.\"\r\n\r\nThe requirements of a successful scent are very strict. A perfume must\r\nbe lasting, but not strong. All its ingredients must continue to\r\nevaporate in the same proportion, otherwise it will change odor and\r\ndeteriorate. Scents kill one another as colors do. The minutest trace of\r\nsome impurity or foreign odor may spoil the whole effect. To mix the\r\ningredients in a vessel of any metal but aluminum or even to filter\r\nthrough a tin funnel is likely to impair the perfume. The odoriferous\r\ncompounds are very sensitive and unstable bodies, otherwise they would\r\nhave no effect upon the olfactory organ. The combination that would be\r\nsuitable for a toilet water would not be good for a talcum powder and\r\nmight spoil in a soap. Perfumery is used even in the \"scentless\" powders\r\nand soaps. In fact it is now used more extensively, if less intensively,\r\nthan ever before in the history of the world. During the Unwashed Ages,\r\ncommonly called the Dark Ages, between the destruction of the Roman\r\nbaths and the construction of the modern bathroom, the art of the\r\nperfumer, like all the fine arts, suffered an eclipse. \"The odor of\r\nsanctity\" was in highest esteem and what that odor was may be imagined\r\nfrom reading the lives of the saints. But in the course of centuries the\r\nrefinements of life began to seep back into Europe from the East by\r\nmeans of the Arabs and Crusaders, and chemistry, then chiefly the art of\r\ncosmetics, began to revive. When science, the greatest democratizing\r\nagent on earth, got into action it elevated the poor to the ranks of\r\nkings and priests in the delights of the palate and the nose. We should\r\nnot despise these delights, for the pleasure they confer is greater, in\r\namount at least, than that of the so-called higher senses. We eat three\r\ntimes a day; some of us drink oftener; few of us visit the concert hall\r\nor the art gallery as often as we do the dining room. Then, too, these\r\nprimitive senses have a stronger influence upon our emotional nature\r\nthan those acquired later in the course of evolution. As Kipling puts\r\nit:\r\n\r\n  Smells are surer than sounds or sights\r\n  To make your heart-strings crack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nCELLULOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganic compounds, on which our life and living depend, consist chiefly\r\nof four elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. These compounds\r\nare sometimes hard to analyze, but when once the chemist has ascertained\r\ntheir constitution he can usually make them out of their elements--if he\r\nwants to. He will not want to do it as a business unless it pays and it\r\nwill not pay unless the manufacturing process is cheaper than the\r\nnatural process. This depends primarily upon the cost of the crude\r\nmaterials. What, then, is the market price of these four elements?\r\nOxygen and nitrogen are free as air, and as we have seen in the second\r\nchapter, their direct combination by the electric spark is possible.\r\nHydrogen is free in the form of water but expensive to extricate by\r\nmeans of the electric current. But we need more carbon than anything\r\nelse and where shall we get that? Bits of crystallized carbon can be\r\npicked up in South Africa and elsewhere, but those who can afford to buy\r\nthem prefer to wear them rather than use them in making synthetic food.\r\nGraphite is rare and hard to melt. We must then have recourse to the\r\ncompounds of carbon. The simplest of these, carbon dioxide, exists in\r\nthe air but only four parts in ten thousand by volume. To extract the\r\ncarbon and get it into combination with the other elements would be a\r\ndifficult and expensive process. Here, then, we must call in cheap\r\nlabor, the cheapest of all laborers, the plants. Pine trees on the\r\nhighlands and cotton plants on the lowlands keep their green traps set\r\nall the day long and with the captured carbon dioxide build up\r\ncellulose. If, then, man wants free carbon he can best get it by\r\ncharring wood in a kiln or digging up that which has been charred in\r\nnature's kiln during the Carboniferous Era. But there is no reason why\r\nhe should want to go back to elemental carbon when he can have it\r\nalready combined with hydrogen in the remains of modern or fossil\r\nvegetation. The synthetic products on which modern chemistry prides\r\nitself, such as vanillin, camphor and rubber, are not built up out of\r\ntheir elements, C, H and O, although they might be as a laboratory\r\nstunt. Instead of that the raw material of the organic chemist is\r\nchiefly cellulose, or the products of its recent or remote destructive\r\ndistillation, tar and oil.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to tell the reader what cellulose is since he now\r\nholds a specimen of it in his hand, pretty pure cellulose except for the\r\nsizing and the specks of carbon that mar the whiteness of its surface.\r\nThis utilization of cellulose is the chief cause of the difference\r\nbetween the modern world and the ancient, for what is called the\r\ninvention of printing is essentially the inventing of paper. The Romans\r\nmade type to stamp their coins and lead pipes with and if they had had\r\npaper to print upon the world might have escaped the Dark Ages. But the\r\nclay tablets of the Babylonians were cumbersome; the wax tablets of the\r\nGreeks were perishable; the papyrus of the Egyptians was fragile;\r\nparchment was expensive and penning was slow, so it was not until\r\nliterature was put on a paper basis that democratic education became\r\npossible. At the present time sheepskin is only used for diplomas,\r\ntreaties and other antiquated documents. And even if your diploma is\r\nwritten in Latin it is likely to be made of sulfated cellulose.\r\n\r\nThe textile industry has followed the same law of development that I\r\nhave indicated in the other industries. Here again we find the three\r\nstages of progress, (1) utilization of natural products, (2) cultivation\r\nof natural products, (3) manufacture of artificial products. The\r\nancients were dependent upon plants, animals and insects for their\r\nfibers. China used silk, Greece and Rome used wool, Egypt used flax and\r\nIndia used cotton. In the course of cultivation for three thousand years\r\nthe animal and vegetable fibers were lengthened and strengthened and\r\ncheapened. But at last man has risen to the level of the worm and can\r\nspin threads to suit himself. He can now rival the wasp in the making of\r\npaper. He is no longer dependent upon the flax and the cotton plant, but\r\ngrinds up trees to get his cellulose. A New York newspaper uses up\r\nnearly 2000 acres of forest a year. The United States grinds up about\r\nfive million cords of wood a year in the manufacture of pulp for paper\r\nand other purposes.\r\n\r\nIn making \"mechanical pulp\" the blocks of wood, mostly spruce and\r\nhemlock, are simply pressed sidewise of the grain against wet\r\ngrindstones. But in wood fiber the cellulose is in part combined with\r\nlignin, which is worse than useless. To break up the ligno-cellulose\r\ncombine chemicals are used. The logs for this are not ground fine, but\r\ncut up by disk chippers. The chips are digested for several hours under\r\nheat and pressure with acid or alkali. There are three processes in\r\nvogue. In the most common process the reagent is calcium sulfite, made\r\nby passing sulfur fumes (SO_{2}) into lime water. In another process a\r\nsolution of caustic of soda is used to disintegrate the wood. The third,\r\nknown as the \"sulfate\" process, should rather be called the sulfide\r\nprocess since the active agent is an alkaline solution of sodium sulfide\r\nmade by roasting sodium sulfate with the carbonaceous matter extracted\r\nfrom the wood. This sulfate process, though the most recent of the\r\nthree, is being increasingly employed in this country, for by means of\r\nit the resinous pine wood of the South can be worked up and the final\r\nproduct, known as kraft paper because it is strong, is used for\r\nwrapping.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the process we get nearly pure cellulose which, as you can\r\nsee by examining this page under a microscope, consists of a tangled web\r\nof thin white fibers, the remains of the original cell walls. Owing to\r\nthe severe treatment it has undergone wood pulp paper does not last so\r\nlong as the linen rag paper used by our ancestors. The pages of the\r\nnewspapers, magazines and books printed nowadays are likely to become\r\nbrown and brittle in a few years, no great loss for the most part since\r\nthey have served their purpose, though it is a pity that a few copies of\r\nthe worst of them could not be printed on permanent paper for\r\npreservation in libraries so that future generations could congratulate\r\nthemselves on their progress in civilization.\r\n\r\nBut in our absorption in the printed page we must not forget the other\r\nuses of paper. The paper clothing, so often prophesied, has not yet\r\narrived. Even paper collars have gone out of fashion--if they ever were\r\nin. In Germany during the war paper was used for socks, shirts and shoes\r\nas well as handkerchiefs and napkins but it could not stand wear and\r\nwashing. Our sanitary engineers have set us to drinking out of\r\nsharp-edged paper cups and we blot our faces instead of wiping them.\r\nTwine is spun of paper and furniture made of the twine, a rival of\r\nrattan. Cloth and matting woven of paper yarn are being used for burlap\r\nand grass in the making of bags and suitcases.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we are not so much interested in manufactures of\r\ncellulose itself, that is, wood, paper and cotton, as we are in its\r\nchemical derivatives. Cellulose, as we can see from the symbol,\r\nC_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, is composed of the three elements of carbon, hydrogen\r\nand oxygen. These are present in the same proportion as in starch\r\n(C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}), while glucose or grape sugar (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}) has\r\none molecule of water more. But glucose is soluble in cold water and\r\nstarch is soluble in hot, while cellulose is soluble in neither.\r\nConsequently cellulose cannot serve us for food, although some of the\r\nvegetarian animals, notably the goat, have a digestive apparatus that\r\ncan handle it. In Finland and Germany birch wood pulp and straw were\r\nused not only as an ingredient of cattle food but also put into war\r\nbread. It is not likely, however, that the human stomach even under the\r\npressure of famine is able to get much nutriment out of sawdust. But by\r\ndigesting with dilute acid sawdust can be transformed into sugars and\r\nthese by fermentation into alcohol, so it would be possible for a man\r\nafter he has read his morning paper to get drunk on it.\r\n\r\nIf the cellulose, instead of being digested a long time in dilute acid,\r\nis dipped into a solution of sulfuric acid (50 to 80 per cent.) and then\r\nwashed and dried it acquires a hard, tough and translucent coating that\r\nmakes it water-proof and grease-proof. This is the \"parchment paper\"\r\nthat has largely replaced sheepskin. Strong alkali has a similar effect\r\nto strong acid. In 1844 John Mercer, a Lancashire calico printer,\r\ndiscovered that by passing cotton cloth or yarn through a cold 30 per\r\ncent. solution of caustic soda the fiber is shortened and strengthened.\r\nFor over forty years little attention was paid to this discovery, but\r\nwhen it was found that if the material was stretched so that it could\r\nnot shrink on drying the twisted ribbons of the cotton fiber were\r\nchanged into smooth-walled cylinders like silk, the process came into\r\ngeneral use and nowadays much that passes for silk is \"mercerized\"\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nAnother step was taken when Cross of London discovered that when the\r\nmercerized cotton was treated with carbon disulfide it was dissolved to\r\na yellow liquid. This liquid contains the cellulose in solution as a\r\ncellulose xanthate and on acidifying or heating the cellulose is\r\nrecovered in a hydrated form. If this yellow solution of cellulose is\r\nsquirted out of tubes through extremely minute holes into acidulated\r\nwater, each tiny stream becomes instantly solidified into a silky thread\r\nwhich may be spun and woven like that ejected from the spinneret of the\r\nsilkworm. The origin of natural silk, if we think about it, rather\r\ndetracts from the pleasure of wearing it, and if \"he who needlessly\r\nsets foot upon a worm\" is to be avoided as a friend we must hope that\r\nthe advance of the artificial silk industry will be rapid enough to\r\nrelieve us of the necessity of boiling thousands of baby worms in their\r\ncradles whenever we want silk stockings.\r\n\r\n  On a plain rush hurdle a silkworm lay\r\n  When a proud young princess came that way.\r\n  The haughty daughter of a lordly king\r\n  Threw a sidelong glance at the humble thing,\r\n  Little thinking she walked in pride\r\n  In the winding sheet where the silkworm died.\r\n\r\nBut so far we have not reached a stage where we can altogether dispense\r\nwith the services of the silkworm. The viscose threads made by the\r\nprocess look as well as silk, but they are not so strong, especially\r\nwhen wet.\r\n\r\nBesides the viscose method there are several other methods of getting\r\ncellulose into solution so that artificial fibers may be made from it. A\r\nstrong solution of zinc chloride will serve and this process used to be\r\nemployed for making the threads to be charred into carbon filaments for\r\nincandescent bulbs. Cellulose is also soluble in an ammoniacal solution\r\nof copper hydroxide. The liquid thus formed is squirted through a fine\r\nnozzle into a precipitating solution of caustic soda and glucose, which\r\nbrings back the cellulose to its original form.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on explosives I explained how cellulose treated with\r\nnitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid was nitrated. The cellulose\r\nmolecule having three hydroxyl (--OH) groups, can take up one, two or\r\nthree nitrate groups (--ONO_{2}). The higher nitrates are known as\r\nguncotton and form the basis of modern dynamite and smokeless powder.\r\nThe lower nitrates, known as pyroxylin, are less explosive, although\r\nstill very inflammable. All these nitrates are, like the original\r\ncellulose, insoluble in water, but unlike the original cellulose,\r\nsoluble in a mixture of ether and alcohol. The solution is called\r\ncollodion and is now in common use to spread a new skin over a wound.\r\nThe great war might be traced back to Nobel's cut finger. Alfred Nobel\r\nwas a Swedish chemist--and a pacifist. One day while working in the\r\nlaboratory he cut his finger, as chemists are apt to do, and, again as\r\nchemists are apt to do, he dissolved some guncotton in ether-alcohol and\r\nswabbed it on the wound. At this point, however, his conduct diverges\r\nfrom the ordinary, for instead of standing idle, impatiently waving his\r\nhand in the air to dry the film as most people, including chemists, are\r\napt to do, he put his mind on it and it occurred to him that this sticky\r\nstuff, slowly hardening to an elastic mass, might be just the thing he\r\nwas hunting as an absorbent and solidifier of nitroglycerin. So instead\r\nof throwing away the extra collodion that he had made he mixed it with\r\nnitroglycerin and found that it set to a jelly. The \"blasting gelatin\"\r\nthus discovered proved to be so insensitive to shock that it could be\r\nsafely transported or fired from a cannon. This was the first of the\r\nhigh explosives that have been the chief factor in modern warfare.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole, collodion has healed more wounds than it has caused\r\nbesides being of infinite service to mankind otherwise. It has made\r\nmodern photography possible, for the film we use in the camera and\r\nmoving picture projector consists of a gelatin coating on a pyroxylin\r\nbacking. If collodion is forced through fine glass tubes instead of\r\nthrough a slit, it comes out a thread instead of a film. If the\r\ncollodion jet is run into a vat of cold water the ether and alcohol\r\ndissolve; if it is run into a chamber of warm air they evaporate. The\r\nthread of nitrated cellulose may be rendered less inflammable by taking\r\nout the nitrate groups by treatment with ammonium or calcium sulfide.\r\nThis restores the original cellulose, but now it is an endless thread of\r\nany desired thickness, whereas the native fiber was in size and length\r\nadapted to the needs of the cottonseed instead of the needs of man. The\r\nold motto, \"If you want a thing done the way you want it you must do it\r\nyourself,\" explains why the chemist has been called in to supplement the\r\nwork of nature in catering to human wants.\r\n\r\nInstead of nitric acid we may use strong acetic acid to dissolve the\r\ncotton. The resulting cellulose acetates are less inflammable than the\r\nnitrates, but they are more brittle and more expensive. Motion picture\r\nfilms made from them can be used in any hall without the necessity of\r\nimprisoning the operator in a fire-proof box where if anything happens\r\nhe can burn up all by himself without disturbing the audience. The\r\ncellulose acetates are being used for auto goggles and gas masks as well\r\nas for windows in leather curtains and transparent coverings for index\r\ncards. A new use that has lately become important is the varnishing of\r\naeroplane wings, as it does not readily absorb water or catch fire and\r\nmakes the cloth taut and air-tight. Aeroplane wings can be made of\r\ncellulose acetate sheets as transparent as those of a dragon-fly and not\r\neasy to see against the sky.\r\n\r\nThe nitrates, sulfates and acetates are the salts or esters of the\r\nrespective acids, but recently true ethers or oxides of cellulose have\r\nbeen prepared that may prove still better since they contain no acid\r\nradicle and are neutral and stable.\r\n\r\nThese are in brief the chief processes for making what is commonly but\r\nquite improperly called \"artificial silk.\" They are not the same\r\nsubstance as silkworm silk and ought not to be--though they sometimes\r\nare--sold as such. They are none of them as strong as the silk fiber\r\nwhen wet, although if I should venture to say which of the various makes\r\nweakens the most on wetting I should get myself into trouble. I will\r\nonly say that if you have a grudge against some fisherman give him a fly\r\nline of artificial silk, 'most any kind.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate process was discovered by Count Hilaire de Chardonnet while\r\nhe was at the Polytechnic School of Paris, and he devoted his life and\r\nhis fortune trying to perfect it. Samples of the artificial silk were\r\nexhibited at the Paris Exposition in 1889 and two years later he started\r\na factory at Basançon. In 1892, Cross and Bevan, English chemists,\r\ndiscovered the viscose or xanthate process, and later the acetate\r\nprocess. But although all four of these processes were invented\r\nin France and England, Germany reaped most benefit from the new\r\nindustry, which was bringing into that country $6,000,000 a year\r\nbefore the war. The largest producer in the world was the Vereinigte\r\nGlanzstoff-Fabriken of Elberfeld, which was paying annual dividends of\r\n34 per cent. in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe raw materials, as may be seen, are cheap and abundant, merely\r\ncellulose, salt, sulfur, carbon, air and water. Any kind of cellulose\r\ncan be used, cotton waste, rags, paper, or even wood pulp. The processes\r\nare various, the names of the products are numerous and the uses are\r\ninnumerable. Even the most inattentive must have noticed the widespread\r\nemployment of these new forms of cellulose. We can buy from a street\r\nbarrow for fifteen cents near-silk neckties that look as well as those\r\nsold for seventy-five. As for wear--well, they all of them wear till\r\nafter we get tired of wearing them. Paper \"vulcanized\" by being run\r\nthrough a 30 per cent. solution of zinc chloride and subjected to\r\nhydraulic pressure comes out hard and horny and may be used for trunks\r\nand suit cases. Viscose tubes for sausage containers are more sanitary\r\nand appetizing than the customary casings. Viscose replaces ramie or\r\ncotton in the Welsbach gas mantles. Viscose film, transparent and a\r\nthousandth of an inch thick (cellophane), serves for candy wrappers.\r\nCellulose acetate cylinders spun out of larger orifices than silk are\r\ntrying--not very successfully as yet--to compete with hog's bristles and\r\nhorsehair. Stir powdered metals into the cellulose solution and you have\r\nthe Bayko yarn. Bayko (from the manufacturers, Farbenfabriken vorm.\r\nFriedr. Bayer and Company) is one of those telescoped names like Socony,\r\nNylic, Fominco, Alco, Ropeco, Ripans, Penn-Yan, Anzac, Dagor, Dora and\r\nCadets, which will be the despair of future philologers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAPER MILL IN ACTION\r\n\r\nThis photograph was taken in the barking room of the big pulp mill of\r\nthe Great Northern Paper Company at Millinocket, Maine]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELLULOSE FROM WOOD PULP\r\n\r\nThis is now made into a large variety of useful articles of which a few\r\nexamples are here pictured]\r\n\r\nSoluble cellulose may enable us in time to dispense with the weaver as\r\nwell as the silkworm. It may by one operation give us fabrics instead of\r\nthreads. A machine has been invented for manufacturing net and lace, the\r\nliquid material being poured on one side of a roller and the fabric\r\nbeing reeled off on the other side. The process seems capable of\r\nindefinite extension and application to various sorts of woven, knit and\r\nreticulated goods. The raw material is cotton waste and the finished\r\nfabric is a good substitute for silk. As in the process of making\r\nartificial silk the cellulose is dissolved in a cupro-ammoniacal\r\nsolution, but instead of being forced out through minute openings to\r\nform threads, as in that process, the paste is allowed to flow upon a\r\nrevolving cylinder which is engraved with the pattern of the desired\r\ntextile. A scraper removes the excess and the turning of the cylinder\r\nbrings the paste in the engraved lines down into a bath which solidifies\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTulle or net is now what is chiefly being turned out, but the engraved\r\ndesign may be as elaborate and artistic as desired, and various\r\nmaterials can be used. Since the threads wherever they cross are united,\r\nthe fabric is naturally stronger than the ordinary. It is all of a piece\r\nand not composed of parts. In short, we seem to be on the eve of a\r\nrevolution in textiles that is the same as that taking place in building\r\nmaterials. Our concrete structures, however great, are all one stone.\r\nThey are not built up out of blocks, but cast as a whole.\r\n\r\nLace has always been the aristocrat among textiles. It has maintained\r\nits exclusiveness hitherto by being based upon hand labor. In no other\r\nway could one get so much painful, patient toil put into such a light\r\nand portable form. A filmy thing twined about a neck or dropping from a\r\nwrist represented years of work by poor peasant girls or pallid, unpaid\r\nnuns. A visit to a lace factory, even to the public rooms where the\r\nwornout women were not to be seen, is enough to make one resolve never\r\nto purchase any such thing made by hand again. But our good resolutions\r\ndo not last long and in time we forget the strained eyes and bowed\r\nbacks, or, what is worse, value our bit of lace all the more because it\r\nmeans that some poor woman has put her life and health into it, netting\r\nand weaving, purling and knotting, twining and twisting, throwing and\r\ndrawing, thread by thread, day after day, until her eyes can no longer\r\nsee and her fingers have become stiffened.\r\n\r\nBut man is not naturally cruel. He does not really enjoy being a slave\r\ndriver, either of human or animal slaves, although he can be hardened to\r\nit with shocking ease if there seems no other way of getting what he\r\nwants. So he usually welcomes that Great Liberator, the Machine. He\r\nprefers to drive the tireless engine than to whip the straining horses.\r\nHe had rather see the farmer riding at ease in a mowing machine than\r\nbending his back over a scythe.\r\n\r\nThe Machine is not only the Great Liberator, it is the Great Leveler\r\nalso. It is the most powerful of the forces for democracy. An\r\naristocracy can hardly be maintained except by distinction in dress, and\r\ndistinction in dress can only be maintained by sumptuary laws or\r\ncostliness. Sumptuary laws are unconstitutional in this country, hence\r\nthe stress laid upon costliness. But machinery tends to bring styles\r\nand fabrics within the reach of all. The shopgirl is almost as well\r\ndressed on the street as her rich customer. The man who buys ready-made\r\nclothing is only a few weeks behind the vanguard of the fashion. There\r\nis often no difference perceptible to the ordinary eye between cheap and\r\nhigh-priced clothing once the price tag is off. Jewels as a portable\r\nform of concentrated costliness have been in favor from the earliest\r\nages, but now they are losing their factitious value through the advance\r\nof invention. Rubies of unprecedented size, not imitation, but genuine\r\nrubies, can now be manufactured at reasonable rates. And now we may hope\r\nthat lace may soon be within the reach of all, not merely lace of the\r\nestablished forms, but new and more varied and intricate and beautiful\r\ndesigns, such as the imagination has been able to conceive, but the hand\r\ncannot execute.\r\n\r\nDissolving nitrocellulose in ether and alcohol we get the collodion\r\nvarnish that we are all familiar with since we have used it on our cut\r\nfingers. Spread it on cloth instead of your skin and it makes a very\r\ngood leather substitute. As we all know to our cost the number of\r\nanimals to be skinned has not increased so rapidly in recent years as\r\nthe number of feet to be shod. After having gone barefoot for a million\r\nyears or so the majority of mankind have decided to wear shoes and this\r\nchange in fashion comes at a time, roughly speaking, when pasture land\r\nis getting scarce. Also there are books to be bound and other new things\r\nto be done for which leather is needed. The war has intensified the\r\nstringency; so has feminine fashion. The conventions require that the\r\nshoe-tops extend nearly to skirt-bottom and this means that an inch or\r\nso must be added to the shoe-top every year. Consequent to this rise in\r\nleather we have to pay as much for one shoe as we used to pay for a\r\npair.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a chance for Necessity to exercise her maternal function.\r\nAnd she has responded nobly. A progeny of new substances have been\r\nbrought forth and, what is most encouraging to see, they are no longer\r\ntrying to worm their way into favor as surreptitious surrogates under\r\nthe names of \"leatheret,\" \"leatherine,\" \"leatheroid\" and\r\n\"leather-this-or-that\" but come out boldly under names of their own\r\ncoinage and declare themselves not an imitation, not even a substitute,\r\nbut \"better than leather.\" This policy has had the curious result of\r\ncompelling the cowhide men to take full pages in the magazines to call\r\nattention to the forgotten virtues of good old-fashioned sole-leather!\r\nThere are now upon the market synthetic shoes that a vegetarian could\r\nwear with a clear conscience. The soles are made of some rubber\r\ncomposition; the uppers of cellulose fabric (canvas) coated with a\r\ncellulose solution such as I have described.\r\n\r\nEach firm keeps its own process for such substance a dead secret, but\r\nwithout prying into these we can learn enough to satisfy our legitimate\r\ncuriosity. The first of the artificial fabrics was the old-fashioned and\r\nstill indispensable oil-cloth, that is canvas painted or printed with\r\nlinseed oil carrying the desired pigments. Linseed oil belongs to the\r\nclass of compounds that the chemist calls \"unsaturated\" and the\r\npsychologist would call \"unsatisfied.\" They take up oxygen from the air\r\nand become solid, hence are called the \"drying oils,\" although this\r\ndoes not mean that they lose water, for they have not any to lose.\r\nLater, ground cork was mixed with the linseed oil and then it went by\r\nits Latin name, \"linoleum.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step was to cut loose altogether from the natural oils and use\r\nfor the varnish a solution of some of the cellulose esters, usually the\r\nnitrate (pyroxylin or guncotton), more rarely the acetate. As a solvent\r\nthe ether-alcohol mixture forming collodion was, as we have seen, the\r\nfirst to be employed, but now various other solvents are in use, among\r\nthem castor oil, methyl alcohol, acetone, and the acetates of amyl or\r\nethyl. Some of these will be recognized as belonging to the fruit\r\nessences that we considered in Chapter V, and doubtless most of us have\r\nperceived an odor as of over-ripe pears, bananas or apples mysteriously\r\nemanating from a newly lacquered radiator. With powdered bronze,\r\nimitation gold, aluminum or something of the kind a metallic finish can\r\nbe put on any surface.\r\n\r\nCanvas coated or impregnated with such soluble cellulose gives us new\r\nflexible and durable fabrics that have other advantages over leather\r\nbesides being cheaper and more abundant. Without such material for\r\ncurtains and cushions the automobile business would have been sorely\r\nhampered. It promises to provide us with a book binding that will not\r\ncrumble to powder in the course of twenty years. Linen collars may be\r\nwater-proofed and possibly Dame Fashion--being a fickle lady--may some\r\nday relent and let us wear such sanitary and economical neckwear. For\r\nshoes, purses, belts and the like the cellulose varnish or veneer is\r\nusually colored and stamped to resemble the grain of any kind of\r\nleather desired, even snake or alligator.\r\n\r\nIf instead of dissolving the cellulose nitrate and spreading it on\r\nfabric we combine it with camphor we get celluloid, a plastic solid\r\ncapable of innumerable applications. But that is another story and must\r\nbe reserved for the next chapter.\r\n\r\nBut before leaving the subject of cellulose proper I must refer back\r\nagain to its chief source, wood. We inherited from the Indians a\r\nwell-wooded continent. But the pioneer carried an ax on his shoulder and\r\nbegan using it immediately. For three hundred years the trees have been\r\ncut down faster than they could grow, first to clear the land, next for\r\nfuel, then for lumber and lastly for paper. Consequently we are within\r\nsight of a shortage of wood as we are of coal and oil. But the coal and\r\noil are irrecoverable while the wood may be regrown, though it would\r\nrequire another three hundred years and more to grow some of the trees\r\nwe have cut down. For fuel a pound of coal is about equal to two pounds\r\nof wood, and a pound of gasoline to three pounds of wood in heating\r\nvalue, so there would be a great loss in efficiency and economy if the\r\nworld had to go back to a wood basis. But when that time shall come, as,\r\nof course, it must come some time, the wood will doubtless not be burned\r\nin its natural state but will be converted into hydrogen and carbon\r\nmonoxide in a gas producer or will be distilled in closed ovens giving\r\ncharcoal and gas and saving the by-products, the tar and acid liquors.\r\nAs it is now the lumberman wastes two-thirds of every tree he cuts down.\r\nThe rest is left in the forest as stump and tops or thrown out at the\r\nmill as sawdust and slabs. The slabs and other scraps may be used as\r\nfuel or worked up into small wood articles like laths and clothes-pins.\r\nThe sawdust is burned or left to rot. But it is possible, although it\r\nmay not be profitable, to save all this waste.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter I showed the advantages of the introduction of\r\nby-product coke-ovens. The same principle applies to wood as to coal. If\r\na cord of wood (128 cubic feet) is subjected to a process of destructive\r\ndistillation it yields about 50 bushels of charcoal, 11,500 cubic feet\r\nof gas, 25 gallons of tar, 10 gallons of crude wood alcohol and 200\r\npounds of crude acetate of lime. Resinous woods such as pine and fir\r\ndistilled with steam give turpentine and rosin. The acetate of lime\r\ngives acetic acid and acetone. The wood (methyl) alcohol is almost as\r\nuseful as grain (ethyl) alcohol in arts and industry and has the\r\nadvantage of killing off those who drink it promptly instead of slowly.\r\n\r\nThe chemist is an economical soul. He is never content until he has\r\nconverted every kind of waste product into some kind of profitable\r\nby-product. He now has his glittering eye fixed upon the mountains of\r\nsawdust that pile up about the lumber mills. He also has a notion that\r\nhe can beat lumber for some purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSYNTHETIC PLASTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I told how Alfred Nobel cut his finger and, daubing\r\nit over with collodion, was led to the discovery of high explosive,\r\ndynamite. I remarked that the first part of this process--the hurting\r\nand the healing of the finger--might happen to anybody but not everybody\r\nwould be led to discovery thereby. That is true enough, but we must not\r\nthink that the Swedish chemist was the only observant man in the world.\r\nAbout this same time a young man in Albany, named John Wesley Hyatt, got\r\na sore finger and resorted to the same remedy and was led to as great a\r\ndiscovery. His father was a blacksmith and his education was confined to\r\nwhat he could get at the seminary of Eddytown, New York, before he was\r\nsixteen. At that age he set out for the West to make his fortune. He\r\nmade it, but after a long, hard struggle. His trade of typesetter gave\r\nhim a living in Illinois, New York or wherever he wanted to go, but he\r\nwas not content with his wages or his hours. However, he did not strike\r\nto reduce his hours or increase his wages. On the contrary, he increased\r\nhis working time and used it to increase his income. He spent his nights\r\nand Sundays in making billiard balls, not at all the sort of thing you\r\nwould expect of a young man of his Christian name. But working with\r\nbilliard balls is more profitable than playing with them--though that\r\nis not the sort of thing you would expect a man of my surname to say.\r\nHyatt had seen in the papers an offer of a prize of $10,000 for the\r\ndiscovery of a satisfactory substitute for ivory in the making of\r\nbilliard balls and he set out to get that prize. I don't know whether he\r\never got it or not, but I have in my hand a newly published circular\r\nannouncing that Mr. Hyatt has now perfected a process for making\r\nbilliard balls \"better than ivory.\" Meantime he has turned out several\r\nhundred other inventions, many of them much more useful and profitable,\r\nbut I imagine that he takes less satisfaction in any of them than he\r\ndoes in having solved the problem that he undertook fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the prize was that the game on the billiard table was\r\ngetting more popular and the game in the African jungle was getting\r\nscarcer, especially elephants having tusks more than 2-7/16 inches in\r\ndiameter. The raising of elephants is not an industry that promises as\r\nquick returns as raising chickens or Belgian hares. To make a ball\r\nhaving exactly the weight, color and resiliency to which billiard\r\nplayers have become accustomed seemed an impossibility. Hyatt tried\r\ncompressed wood, but while he did not succeed in making billiard balls\r\nhe did build up a profitable business in stamped checkers and dominoes.\r\n\r\nSetting type in the way they did it in the sixties was hard on the\r\nhands. And if the skin got worn thin or broken the dirty lead type were\r\nliable to infect the fingers. One day in 1863 Hyatt, finding his fingers\r\nwere getting raw, went to the cupboard where was kept the \"liquid\r\ncuticle\" used by the printers. But when he got there he found it was\r\nbare, for the vial had tipped over--you know how easily they tip\r\nover--and the collodion had run out and solidified on the shelf.\r\nPossibly Hyatt was annoyed, but if so he did not waste time raging\r\naround the office to find out who tipped over that bottle. Instead he\r\npulled off from the wood a bit of the dried film as big as his thumb\r\nnail and examined it with that \"'satiable curtiosity,\" as Kipling calls\r\nit, which is characteristic of the born inventor. He found it tough and\r\nelastic and it occurred to him that it might be worth $10,000. It turned\r\nout to be worth many times that.\r\n\r\nCollodion, as I have explained in previous chapters, is a solution in\r\nether and alcohol of guncotton (otherwise known as pyroxylin or\r\nnitrocellulose), which is made by the action of nitric acid on cotton.\r\nHyatt tried mixing the collodion with ivory powder, also using it to\r\ncover balls of the necessary weight and solidity, but they did not work\r\nvery well and besides were explosive. A Colorado saloon keeper wrote in\r\nto complain that one of the billiard players had touched a ball with a\r\nlighted cigar, which set it off and every man in the room had drawn his\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the dissolved guncotton was that it could not be\r\nmolded. It did not swell up and set; it merely dried up and shrunk. When\r\nthe solvent evaporated it left a wrinkled, shriveled, horny film,\r\nsatisfactory to the surgeon but not to the man who wanted to make balls\r\nand hairpins and knife handles out of it. In England Alexander Parkes\r\nbegan working on the problem in 1855 and stuck to it for ten years\r\nbefore he, or rather his backers, gave up. He tried mixing in various\r\nthings to stiffen up the pyroxylin. Of these, camphor, which he tried in\r\n1865, worked the best, but since he used castor oil to soften the mass\r\narticles made of \"parkesine\" did not hold up in all weathers.\r\n\r\nAnother Englishman, Daniel Spill, an associate of Parkes, took up the\r\nproblem where he had dropped it and turned out a better product,\r\n\"xylonite,\" though still sticking to the idea that castor oil was\r\nnecessary to get the two solids, the guncotton and the camphor,\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBut Hyatt, hearing that camphor could be used and not knowing enough\r\nabout what others had done to follow their false trails, simply mixed\r\nhis camphor and guncotton together without any solvent and put the\r\nmixture in a hot press. The two solids dissolved one another and when\r\nthe press was opened there was a clear, solid, homogeneous block\r\nof--what he named--\"celluloid.\" The problem was solved and in the\r\nsimplest imaginable way. Tissue paper, that is, cellulose, is treated\r\nwith nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid. The nitration is not\r\ncarried so far as to produce the guncotton used in explosives but only\r\nfar enough to make a soluble nitrocellulose or pyroxylin. This is pulped\r\nand mixed with half the quantity of camphor, pressed into cakes and\r\ndried. If this mixture is put into steam-heated molds and subjected to\r\nhydraulic pressure it takes any desired form. The process remains\r\nessentially the same as was worked out by the Hyatt brothers in the\r\nfactory they set up in Newark in 1872 and some of their original\r\nmachines are still in use. But this protean plastic takes innumerable\r\nforms and almost as many names. Each factory has its own secrets and\r\nlays claim to peculiar merits. The fundamental product itself is not\r\npatented, so trade names are copyrighted to protect the product. I have\r\nalready mentioned three, \"parkesine,\" \"xylonite\" and \"celluloid,\" and I\r\nmay add, without exhausting the list of species belonging to this genus,\r\n\"viscoloid,\" \"lithoxyl,\" \"fiberloid,\" \"coraline,\" \"eburite,\"\r\n\"pulveroid,\" \"ivorine,\" \"pergamoid,\" \"duroid,\" \"ivortus,\" \"crystalloid,\"\r\n\"transparene,\" \"litnoid,\" \"petroid,\" \"pasbosene,\" \"cellonite\" and\r\n\"pyralin.\"\r\n\r\nCelluloid can be given any color or colors by mixing in aniline dyes or\r\nmetallic pigments. The color may be confined to the surface or to the\r\ninterior or pervade the whole. If the nitrated tissue paper is bleached\r\nthe celluloid is transparent or colorless. In that case it is necessary\r\nto add an antacid such as urea to prevent its getting yellow or opaque.\r\nTo make it opaque and less inflammable oxides or chlorides of zinc,\r\naluminum, magnesium, etc., are mixed in.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the question of their variations and relative merits\r\nwe may consider the advantages of the pyroxylin plastics in general.\r\nHere we have a new substance, the product of the creative genius of man,\r\nand therefore adaptable to his needs. It is hard but light, tough but\r\nelastic, easily made and tolerably cheap. Heated to the boiling point of\r\nwater it becomes soft and flexible. It can be turned, carved, ground,\r\npolished, bent, pressed, stamped, molded or blown. To make a block of\r\nany desired size simply pile up the sheets and put them in a hot press.\r\nTo get sheets of any desired thickness, simply shave them off the block.\r\nTo make a tube of any desired size, shape or thickness squirt out the\r\nmixture through a ring-shaped hole or roll the sheets around a hot bar.\r\nCut the tube into sections and you have rings to be shaped and stamped\r\ninto box bodies or napkin rings. Print words or pictures on a celluloid\r\nsheet, put a thin transparent sheet over it and weld them together, then\r\nyou have something like the horn book of our ancestors, but better.\r\n\r\nNowadays such things as celluloid and pyralin can be sold under their\r\nown name, but in the early days the artificial plastics, like every new\r\nthing, had to resort to _camouflage_, a very humiliating expedient since\r\nin some cases they were better than the material they were forced to\r\nimitate. Tortoise shell, for instance, cracks, splits and twists, but a\r\n\"tortoise shell\" comb of celluloid looks as well and lasts better. Horn\r\narticles are limited to size of the ceratinous appendages that can be\r\nborne on the animal's head, but an imitation of horn can be made of any\r\nthickness by wrapping celluloid sheets about a cone. Ivory, which also\r\nhas a laminated structure, may be imitated by rolling together alternate\r\nwhite opaque and colorless translucent sheets. Some of the sheets are\r\nwrinkled in order to produce the knots and irregularities of the grain\r\nof natural ivory. Man's chief difficulty in all such work is to imitate\r\nthe imperfections of nature. His whites are too white, his surfaces are\r\ntoo smooth, his shapes are too regular, his products are too pure.\r\n\r\nThe precious red coral of the Mediterranean can be perfectly imitated by\r\ntaking a cast of a coral branch and filling in the mold with celluloid\r\nof the same color and hardness. The clear luster of amber, the dead\r\nblack of ebony, the cloudiness of onyx, the opalescence of alabaster,\r\nthe glow of carnelian--once confined to the selfish enjoyment of the\r\nrich--are now within the reach of every one, thanks to this chameleon\r\nmaterial. Mosaics may be multiplied indefinitely by laying together\r\nsheets and sticks of celluloid, suitably cut and colored to make up the\r\npicture, fusing the mass, and then shaving off thin layers from the end.\r\nThat _chef d'oeuvre_ of the Venetian glass makers, the Battle of Isus,\r\nfrom the House of the Faun in Pompeii, can be reproduced as fast as the\r\nmachine can shave them off the block. And the tesserae do not fall out\r\nlike those you bought on the Rialto.\r\n\r\nThe process thus does for mosaics, ivory and coral what printing does\r\nfor pictures. It is a mechanical multiplier and only by such means can\r\nwe ever attain to a state of democratic luxury. The product, in cases\r\nwhere the imitation is accurate, is equally valuable except to those who\r\ndelight in thinking that coral insects, Italian craftsmen and elephants\r\nhave been laboring for years to put a trinket into their hands. The Lord\r\nmay be trusted to deal with such selfish souls according to their\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nBut it is very low praise for a synthetic product that it can pass\r\nitself off, more or less acceptably, as a natural product. If that is\r\nall we could do without it. It must be an improvement in some respects\r\non anything to be found in nature or it does not represent a real\r\nadvance. So celluloid and its congeners are not confined to the shapes\r\nof shell and coral and crystal, or to the grain of ivory and wood and\r\nhorn, the colors of amber and amethyst and lapis lazuli, but can be\r\ngiven forms and textures and tints that were never known before 1869.\r\n\r\nLet me see now, have I mentioned all the uses of celluloid? Oh, no,\r\nthere are handles for canes, umbrellas, mirrors and brushes, knives,\r\nwhistles, toys, blown animals, card cases, chains, charms, brooches,\r\nbadges, bracelets, rings, book bindings, hairpins, campaign buttons,\r\ncuff and collar buttons, cuffs, collars and dickies, tags, cups, knobs,\r\npaper cutters, picture frames, chessmen, pool balls, ping pong balls,\r\npiano keys, dental plates, masks for disfigured faces, penholders,\r\neyeglass frames, goggles, playing cards--and you can carry on the list\r\nas far as you like.\r\n\r\nCelluloid has its disadvantages. You may mold, you may color the stuff\r\nas you will, the scent of the camphor will cling around it still. This\r\nis not usually objectionable except where the celluloid is trying to\r\npass itself off for something else, in which case it deserves no\r\nsympathy. It is attacked and dissolved by hot acids and alkalies. It\r\nsoftens up when heated, which is handy in shaping it though not so\r\ndesirable afterward. But the worst of its failings is its\r\ncombustibility. It is not explosive, but it takes fire from a flame and\r\nburns furiously with clouds of black smoke.\r\n\r\nBut celluloid is only one of many plastic substances that have been\r\nintroduced to the present generation. A new and important group of them\r\nis now being opened up, the so-called \"condensation products.\" If you\r\nwill take down any old volume of chemical research you will find\r\noccasionally words to this effect: \"The reaction resulted in nothing but\r\nan insoluble resin which was not further investigated.\" Such a passage\r\nwould be marked with a tear if chemists were given to crying over their\r\nfailures. For it is the epitaph of a buried hope. It likely meant the\r\nloss of months of labor. The reason the chemist did not do anything\r\nfurther with the gummy stuff that stuck up his test tube was because he\r\ndid not know what to do with it. It could not be dissolved, it could not\r\nbe crystallized, it could not be distilled, therefore it could not be\r\npurified, analyzed and identified.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was in most cases this. The molecule of the compound\r\nthat the chemist was trying to make had combined with others of its kind\r\nto form a molecule too big to be managed by such means. Financiers call\r\nthe process a \"merger.\" Chemists call it \"polymerization.\" The resin was\r\na molecular trust, indissoluble, uncontrollable and contaminating\r\neverything it touched.\r\n\r\nBut chemists--like governments--have learned wisdom in recent years.\r\nThey have not yet discovered in all cases how to undo the process of\r\npolymerization, or, if you prefer the financial phrase, how to\r\nunscramble the eggs. But they have found that these molecular mergers\r\nare very useful things in their way. For instance there is a liquid\r\nknown as isoprene (C_{5}H_{8}). This on heating or standing turns into a\r\ngum, that is nothing less than rubber, which is some multiple of\r\nC_{5}H_{8}.\r\n\r\nFor another instance there is formaldehyde, an acrid smelling gas, used\r\nas a disinfectant. This has the simplest possible formula for a\r\ncarbohydrate, CH_{2}O. But in the leaf of a plant this molecule\r\nmultiplies itself by six and turns into a sweet solid glucose\r\n(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}), or with the loss of water into starch\r\n(C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}) or cellulose (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}).\r\n\r\nBut formaldehyde is so insatiate that it not only combines with itself\r\nbut seizes upon other substances, particularly those having an\r\nacquisitive nature like its own. Such a substance is carbolic acid\r\n(phenol) which, as we all know, is used as a disinfectant like\r\nformaldehyde because it, too, has the power of attacking decomposable\r\norganic matter. Now Prof. Adolf von Baeyer discovered in 1872 that when\r\nphenol and formaldehyde were brought into contact they seized upon one\r\nanother and formed a combine of unusual tenacity, that is, a resin. But\r\nas I have said, chemists in those days were shy of resins. Kleeberg in\r\n1891 tried to make something out of it and W.H. Story in 1895 went so\r\nfar as to name the product \"resinite,\" but nothing came of it until 1909\r\nwhen L.H. Baekeland undertook a serious and systematic study of this\r\nreaction in New York. Baekeland was a Belgian chemist, born at Ghent in\r\n1863 and professor at Bruges. While a student at Ghent he took up\r\nphotography as a hobby and began to work on the problem of doing away\r\nwith the dark-room by producing a printing paper that could be developed\r\nunder ordinary light. When he came over to America in 1889 he brought\r\nhis idea with him and four years later turned out \"Velox,\" with which\r\ndoubtless the reader is familiar. Velox was never patented because, as\r\nDr. Baekeland explained in his speech of acceptance of the Perkin medal\r\nfrom the chemists of America, lawsuits are too expensive. Manufacturers\r\nseem to be coming generally to the opinion that a synthetic name\r\ncopyrighted as a trademark affords better protection than a patent.\r\n\r\nLater Dr. Baekeland turned his attention to the phenol condensation\r\nproducts, working gradually up from test tubes to ton vats according to\r\nhis motto: \"Make your mistakes on a small scale and your profits on a\r\nlarge scale.\" He found that when equal weights of phenol and\r\nformaldehyde were mixed and warmed in the presence of an alkaline\r\ncatalytic agent the solution separated into two layers, the upper\r\naqueous and the lower a resinous precipitate. This resin was soft,\r\nviscous and soluble in alcohol or acetone. But if it was heated under\r\npressure it changed into another and a new kind of resin that was hard,\r\ninelastic, unplastic, infusible and insoluble. The chemical name of this\r\nproduct is \"polymerized oxybenzyl methylene glycol anhydride,\" but\r\nnobody calls it that, not even chemists. It is called \"Bakelite\" after\r\nits inventor.\r\n\r\nThe two stages in its preparation are convenient in many ways. For\r\ninstance, porous wood may be soaked in the soft resin and then by heat\r\nand pressure it is changed to the bakelite form and the wood comes out\r\nwith a hard finish that may be given the brilliant polish of Japanese\r\nlacquer. Paper, cardboard, cloth, wood pulp, sawdust, asbestos and the\r\nlike may be impregnated with the resin, producing tough and hard\r\nmaterial suitable for various purposes. Brass work painted with it and\r\nthen baked at 300° F. acquires a lacquered surface that is unaffected by\r\nsoap. Forced in powder or sheet form into molds under a pressure of 1200\r\nto 2000 pounds to the square inch it takes the most delicate\r\nimpressions. Billiard balls of bakelite are claimed to be better than\r\nivory because, having no grain, they do not swell unequally with heat\r\nand humidity and so lose their sphericity. Pipestems and beads of\r\nbakelite have the clear brilliancy of amber and greater strength.\r\nFountain pens made of it are transparent so you can see how much ink you\r\nhave left. A new and enlarging field for bakelite and allied products is\r\nthe making of noiseless gears for automobiles and other machinery, also\r\nof air-plane propellers.\r\n\r\nCelluloid is more plastic and elastic than bakelite. It is therefore\r\nmore easily worked in sheets and small objects. Celluloid can be made\r\nperfectly transparent and colorless while bakelite is confined to the\r\nrange between a clear amber and an opaque brown or black. On the other\r\nhand bakelite has the advantage in being tasteless, odorless, inert,\r\ninsoluble and non-inflammable. This last quality and its high electrical\r\nresistance give bakelite its chief field of usefulness. Electricity was\r\ndiscovered by the Greeks, who found that amber (_electron_) when rubbed\r\nwould pick up straws. This means simply that amber, like all such\r\nresinous substances, natural or artificial, is a non-conductor or\r\ndi-electric and does not carry off and scatter the electricity collected\r\non the surface by the friction. Bakelite is used in its liquid form for\r\nimpregnating coils to keep the wires from shortcircuiting and in its\r\nsolid form for commutators, magnetos, switch blocks, distributors, and\r\nall sorts of electrical apparatus for automobiles, telephones, wireless\r\ntelegraphy, electric lighting, etc.\r\n\r\nBakelite, however, is only one of an indefinite number of such\r\ncondensation products. As Baeyer said long ago: \"It seems that all the\r\naldehydes will, under suitable circumstances, unite with the aromatic\r\nhydrocarbons to form resins.\" So instead of phenol, other coal tar\r\nproducts such as cresol, naphthol or benzene itself may be used. The\r\ncarbon links (-CH_{2}-, methylene) necessary to hook these carbon rings\r\ntogether may be obtained from other substances than the aldehydes,\r\nfor instance from the amines, or ammonia derivatives. Three chemists,\r\nL.V. Kedman, A.J. Weith and F.P. Broek, working in 1910 on the\r\nIndustrial Fellowships of the late Robert Kennedy Duncan at the\r\nUniversity of Kansas, developed a process using formin instead\r\nof formaldehyde. Formin--or, if you insist upon its full name,\r\nhexa-methylene-tetramine--is a sugar-like substance with a fish-like\r\nsmell. This mixed with crystallized carbolic acid and slightly warmed\r\nmelts to a golden liquid that sets on pouring into molds. It is still\r\nplastic and can be bent into any desired shape, but on further heating\r\nit becomes hard without the need of pressure. Ammonia is given off in\r\nthis process instead of water which is the by-product in the case of\r\nformaldehyde. The product is similar to bakelite, exactly how similar is\r\na question that the courts will have to decide. The inventors threatened\r\nto call it Phenyl-endeka-saligeno-saligenin, but, rightly fearing that\r\nthis would interfere with its salability, they have named it \"redmanol.\"\r\n\r\nA phenolic condensation product closely related to bakelite and redmanol\r\nis condensite, the invention of Jonas Walter Aylesworth. Aylesworth was\r\ntrained in what he referred to as \"the greatest university of the world,\r\nthe Edison laboratory.\" He entered this university at the age of\r\nnineteen at a salary of $3 a week, but Edison soon found that he had in\r\nhis new boy an assistant who could stand being shut up in the laboratory\r\nworking day and night as long as he could. After nine years of close\r\nassociation with Edison he set up a little laboratory in his own back\r\nyard to work out new plastics. He found that by acting on\r\nnaphthalene--the moth-ball stuff--with chlorine he got a series of\r\nuseful products called \"halowaxes.\" The lower chlorinated products are\r\noils, which may be used for impregnating paper or soft wood, making it\r\nnon-inflammable and impregnable to water. If four atoms of chlorine\r\nenter the naphthalene molecule the product is a hard wax that rings like\r\na metal.\r\n\r\nCondensite is anhydrous and infusible, and like its rivals finds its\r\nchief employment in the insulation parts of electrical apparatus. The\r\nrecords of the Edison phonograph are made of it. So are the buttons of\r\nour blue-jackets. The Government at the outbreak of the war ordered\r\n40,000 goggles in condensite frames to protect the eyes of our gunners\r\nfrom the glare and acid fumes.\r\n\r\nThe various synthetics played an important part in the war. According to\r\nan ancient military pun the endurance of soldiers depends upon the\r\nstrength of their soles. The new compound rubber soles were found useful\r\nin our army and the Germans attribute their success in making a little\r\nleather go a long way during the late war to the use of a new synthetic\r\ntanning material known as \"neradol.\" There are various forms of this.\r\nSome are phenolic condensation products of formaldehyde like those we\r\nhave been considering, but some use coal-tar compounds having no phenol\r\ngroups, such as naphthalene sulfonic acid. These are now being made in\r\nEngland under such names as \"paradol,\" \"cresyntan\" and \"syntan.\" They\r\nhave the advantage of the natural tannins such as bark in that they are\r\nof known strength and can be varied to suit.\r\n\r\nThis very grasping compound, formaldehyde, will attack almost anything,\r\neven molecules many times its size. Gelatinous and albuminous substances\r\nof all sorts are solidified by it. Glue, skimmed milk, blood, eggs,\r\nyeast, brewer's slops, may by this magic agent be rescued from waste and\r\nreappear in our buttons, hairpins, roofing, phonographs, shoes or\r\nshoe-polish. The French have made great use of casein hardened by\r\nformaldehyde into what is known as \"galalith\" (i.e., milkstone). This is\r\nharder than celluloid and non-inflammable, but has the disadvantages of\r\nbeing more brittle and of absorbing moisture. A mixture of casein and\r\ncelluloid has something of the merits of both.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, as we should expect, are using the juice of the soy bean,\r\nfamiliar as a condiment to all who patronize chop-sueys or use\r\nWorcestershire sauce. The soy glucine coagulated by formalin gives a\r\nplastic said to be better and cheaper than celluloid. Its inventor, S.\r\nSato, of Sendai University, has named it, according to American\r\nprecedent, \"Satolite,\" and has organized a million-dollar Satolite\r\nCompany at Mukojima.\r\n\r\nThe algin extracted from the Pacific kelp can be used as a rubber\r\nsurrogate for water-proofing cloth. When combined with heavier alkaline\r\nbases it forms a tough and elastic substance that can be rolled into\r\ntransparent sheets like celluloid or turned into buttons and knife\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\nIn Australia when the war shut off the supply of tin the Government\r\ncommission appointed to devise means of preserving fruits recommended\r\nthe use of cardboard containers varnished with \"magramite.\" This is a\r\nname the Australians coined for synthetic resin made from phenol and\r\nformaldehyde like bakelite. Magramite dissolved in alcohol is painted on\r\nthe cardboard cans and when these are stoved the coating becomes\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\nTarasoff has made a series of condensation products from phenol and\r\nformaldehyde with the addition of sulfonated oils. These are formed by\r\nthe action of sulfuric acid on coconut, castor, cottonseed or mineral\r\noils. The products of this combination are white plastics, opaque,\r\ninsoluble and infusible.\r\n\r\nSince I am here chiefly concerned with \"Creative Chemistry,\" that is,\r\nwith the art of making substances not found in nature, I have not spoken\r\nof shellac, asphaltum, rosin, ozocerite and the innumerable gums, resins\r\nand waxes, animal, mineral and vegetable, that are used either by\r\nthemselves or in combination with the synthetics. What particular \"dope\"\r\nor \"mud\" is used to coat a canvas or form a telephone receiver is often\r\nhard to find out. The manufacturer finds secrecy safer than the patent\r\noffice and the chemist of a rival establishment is apt to be baffled in\r\nhis attempt to analyze and imitate. But we of the outside world are not\r\nconcerned with this, though we are interested in the manifold\r\napplications of these new materials.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no limit to these compounds and every week the\r\njournals report new processes and patents. But we must not allow the new\r\nones to crowd out the remembrance of the oldest and most famous of the\r\nsynthetic plasters, hard rubber, to which a separate chapter must be\r\ndevoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE RACE FOR RUBBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one law that regulates all animate and inanimate things. It is\r\nformulated in various ways, for instance:\r\n\r\nRunning down a hill is easy. In Latin it reads, _facilis descensus\r\nAverni._ Herbert Spencer calls it the dissolution of definite coherent\r\nheterogeneity into indefinite incoherent homogeneity. Mother Goose\r\nexpresses it in the fable of Humpty Dumpty, and the business man\r\nextracts the moral as, \"You can't unscramble an egg.\" The theologian\r\ncalls it the dogma of natural depravity. The physicist calls it the\r\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Clausius formulates it as \"The entropy of\r\nthe world tends toward a maximum.\" It is easier to smash up than to\r\nbuild up. Children find that this is true of their toys; the Bolsheviki\r\nhave found that it is true of a civilization. So, too, the chemist knows\r\nanalysis is easier than synthesis and that creative chemistry is the\r\nhighest branch of his art.\r\n\r\nThis explains why chemists discovered how to take rubber apart over\r\nsixty years before they could find out how to put it together. The first\r\nis easy. Just put some raw rubber into a retort and heat it. If you can\r\nstand the odor you will observe the caoutchouc decomposing and a\r\nbenzine-like liquid distilling over. This is called \"isoprene.\" Any\r\nFreshman chemist could write the reaction for this operation. It is\r\nsimply\r\n\r\n  C_{10}H_{16}   -->  2C_{5}H_{8}\r\n  caoutchouc           isoprene\r\n\r\nThat is, one molecule of the gum splits up into two molecules of the\r\nliquid. It is just as easy to write the reaction in the reverse\r\ndirections, as 2 isoprene--> 1 caoutchouc, but nobody could make it go\r\nin that direction. Yet it could be done. It had been done. But the man\r\nwho did it did not know how he did it and could not do it again.\r\nProfessor Tilden in May, 1892, read a paper before the Birmingham\r\nPhilosophical Society in which he said:\r\n\r\n     I was surprised a few weeks ago at finding the contents of the\r\n     bottles containing isoprene from turpentine entirely changed in\r\n     appearance. In place of a limpid, colorless liquid the bottles\r\n     contained a dense syrup in which were floating several large\r\n     masses of a yellowish color. Upon examination this turned out\r\n     to be India rubber.\r\n\r\nBut neither Professor Tilden nor any one else could repeat this\r\naccidental metamorphosis. It was tantalizing, for the world was willing\r\nto pay $2,000,000,000 a year for rubber and the forests of the Amazon\r\nand Congo were failing to meet the demand. A large share of these\r\nmillions would have gone to any chemist who could find out how to make\r\nsynthetic rubber and make it cheaply enough. With such a reward of fame\r\nand fortune the competition among chemists was intense. It took the form\r\nof an international contest in which England and Germany were neck and\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of the \"India Rubber World.\"\r\n\r\nWhat goes into rubber and what is made out of it]\r\n\r\nThe English, who had been beaten by the Germans in the dye business\r\nwhere they had the start, were determined not to lose in this. Prof.\r\nW.H. Perkin, of Manchester University, was one of the most eager, for he\r\nwas inspired by a personal grudge against the Germans as well as by\r\npatriotism and scientific zeal. It was his father who had, fifty years\r\nbefore, discovered mauve, the first of the anilin dyes, but England\r\ncould not hold the business and its rich rewards went over to Germany.\r\nSo in 1909 a corps of chemists set to work under Professor Perkin in the\r\nManchester laboratories to solve the problem of synthetic rubber. What\r\nreagent could be found that would reverse the reaction and convert the\r\nliquid isoprene into the solid rubber? It was discovered, by accident,\r\nwe may say, but it should be understood that such advantageous accidents\r\nhappen only to those who are working for them and know how to utilize\r\nthem. In July, 1910, Dr. Matthews, who had charge of the research, set\r\nsome isoprene to drying over metallic sodium, a common laboratory method\r\nof freeing a liquid from the last traces of water. In September he found\r\nthat the flask was filled with a solid mass of real rubber instead of\r\nthe volatile colorless liquid he had put into it.\r\n\r\nTwenty years before the discovery would have been useless, for sodium\r\nwas then a rare and costly metal, a little of it in a sealed glass tube\r\nbeing passed around the chemistry class once a year as a curiosity, or a\r\ntiny bit cut off and dropped in water to see what a fuss it made. But\r\nnowadays metallic sodium is cheaply produced by the aid of electricity.\r\nThe difficulty lay rather in the cost of the raw material, isoprene. In\r\nindustrial chemistry it is not sufficient that a thing can be made; it\r\nmust be made to pay. Isoprene could be obtained from turpentine, but\r\nthis was too expensive and limited in supply. It would merely mean the\r\ndestruction of pine forests instead of rubber forests. Starch was\r\nfinally decided upon as the best material, since this can be obtained\r\nfor about a cent a pound from potatoes, corn and many other sources.\r\nHere, however, the chemist came to the end of his rope and had to call\r\nthe bacteriologist to his aid. The splitting of the starch molecule is\r\ntoo big a job for man; only the lower organisms, the yeast plant, for\r\nexample, know enough to do that. Owing perhaps to the _entente cordiale_\r\na French biologist was called into the combination, Professor Fernbach,\r\nof the Pasteur Institute, and after eighteen months' hard work he\r\ndiscovered a process of fermentation by which a large amount of fusel\r\noil can be obtained from any starchy stuff. Hitherto the aim in\r\nfermentation and distillation had been to obtain as small a proportion\r\nof fusel as possible, for fusel oil is a mixture of the heavier\r\nalcohols, all of them more poisonous and malodorous than common alcohol.\r\nBut here, as has often happened in the history of industrial chemistry,\r\nthe by-product turned out to be more valuable than the product. From\r\nfusel oil by the use of chlorine isoprene can be prepared, so the chain\r\nwas complete.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the Germans had been making equal progress. In 1905 Prof.\r\nKarl Harries, of Berlin, found out the name of the caoutchouc molecule.\r\nThis discovery was to the chemists what the architect's plan of a house\r\nis to the builder. They knew then what they were trying to construct\r\nand could go about their task intelligently.\r\n\r\nMark Twain said that he could understand something about how astronomers\r\ncould measure the distance of the planets, calculate their weights and\r\nso forth, but he never could see how they could find out their names\r\neven with the largest telescopes. This is a joke in astronomy but it\r\nis not in chemistry. For when the chemist finds out the structure\r\nof a compound he gives it a name which means that. The stuff came\r\nto be called \"caoutchouc,\" because that was the way the Spaniards\r\nof Columbus's time caught the Indian word \"cahuchu.\" When\r\nDr. Priestley called it \"India rubber\" he told merely where it\r\ncame from and what it was good for. But when Harries named it\r\n\"1-5-dimethyl-cyclo-octadien-1-5\" any chemist could draw a picture of it\r\nand give a guess as to how it could be made. Even a person without any\r\nknowledge of chemistry can get the main point of it by merely looking at\r\nthis diagram:\r\n\r\n     C    C              C---C\r\n     ||   ||             ||  |\r\n  C--C    C           C--C   C\r\n     |    |     -->      |   |\r\n     C    C--C           C   C--C\r\n     ||   ||             |   ||\r\n     C    C              C---C\r\n\r\n[Illustration: isoprene _turns into_ caoutchouc]\r\n\r\nI have dropped the 16 H's or hydrogen atoms of the formula for\r\nsimplicity's sake. They simply hook on wherever they can. You will see\r\nthat the isoprene consists of a chain of four carbon atoms (represented\r\nby the C's) with an extra carbon on the side. In the transformation of\r\nthis colorless liquid into soft rubber two of the double linkages break\r\nand so permit the two chains of 4 C's to unite to form one ring of\r\neight. If you have ever played ring-around-a-rosy you will get the idea.\r\nIn Chapter IV I explained that the anilin dyes are built up upon the\r\nbenzene ring of six carbon atoms. The rubber ring consists of eight at\r\nleast and probably more. Any substance containing that peculiar carbon\r\nchain with two double links C=C-C=C can double up--polymerize, the\r\nchemist calls it--into a rubber-like substance. So we may have many\r\nkinds of rubber, some of which may prove to be more useful than that\r\nwhich happens to be found in nature.\r\n\r\nWith the structural formula of Harries as a clue chemists all over the\r\nworld plunged into the problem with renewed hope. The famous Bayer dye\r\nworks at Elberfeld took it up and there in August, 1909, Dr. Fritz\r\nHofmann worked out a process for the converting of pure isoprene into\r\nrubber by heat. Then in 1910 Harries happened upon the same sodium\r\nreaction as Matthews, but when he came to get it patented he found that\r\nthe Englishman had beaten him to the patent office by a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThis Anglo-German rivalry came to a dramatic climax in 1912 at the great\r\nhall of the College of the City of New York when Dr. Carl Duisberg, of\r\nthe Elberfeld factory, delivered an address on the latest achievements\r\nof the chemical industry before the Eighth--and the last for a long\r\ntime--International Congress of Applied Chemistry. Duisberg insisted\r\nupon talking in German, although more of his auditors would have\r\nunderstood him in English. He laid full emphasis upon German\r\nachievements and cast doubt upon the claim of \"the Englishman Tilden\" to\r\nhave prepared artificial rubber in the eighties. Perkin, of Manchester,\r\nconfronted him with his new process for making rubber from potatoes, but\r\nDuisberg countered by proudly displaying two automobile tires made of\r\nsynthetic rubber with which he had made a thousand-mile run.\r\n\r\nThe intense antagonism between the British and German chemists at this\r\ncongress was felt by all present, but we did not foresee that in two\r\nyears from that date they would be engaged in manufacturing poison gas\r\nto fire at one another. It was, however, realized that more was at stake\r\nthan personal reputation and national prestige. Under pressure of the\r\nnew demand for automobiles the price of rubber jumped from $1.25 to $3 a\r\npound in 1910, and millions had been invested in plantations. If\r\nProfessor Perkin was right when he told the congress that by his process\r\nrubber could be made for less than 25 cents a pound it meant that these\r\nplantations would go the way of the indigo plantations when the Germans\r\nsucceeded in making artificial indigo. If Dr. Duisberg was right when he\r\ntold the congress that synthetic rubber would \"certainly appear on the\r\nmarket in a very short time,\" it meant that Germany in war or peace\r\nwould become independent of Brazil in the matter of rubber as she had\r\nbecome independent of Chile in the matter of nitrates.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out both scientists were too sanguine. Synthetic rubber has\r\nnot proved capable of displacing natural rubber by underbidding it nor\r\neven of replacing natural rubber when this is shut out. When Germany\r\nwas blockaded and the success of her armies depended on rubber, price\r\nwas no object. Three Danish sailors who were caught by United States\r\nofficials trying to smuggle dental rubber into Germany confessed that\r\nthey had been selling it there for gas masks at $73 a pound. The German\r\ngas masks in the latter part of the war were made without rubber and\r\nwere frail and leaky. They could not have withstood the new gases which\r\nAmerican chemists were preparing on an unprecedented scale. Every scrap\r\nof old rubber in Germany was saved and worked over and over and diluted\r\nwith fillers and surrogates to the limit of elasticity. Spring tires\r\nwere substituted for pneumatics. So it is evident that the supply of\r\nsynthetic rubber could not have been adequate or satisfactory. Neither,\r\non the other hand, have the British made a success of the Perkin\r\nprocess, although they spent $200,000 on it in the first two years. But,\r\nof course, there was not the same necessity for it as in the case of\r\nGermany, for England had practically a monopoly of the world's supply of\r\nnatural rubber either through owning plantations or controlling\r\nshipping. If rubber could not be manufactured profitably in Germany when\r\nthe demand was imperative and price no consideration it can hardly be\r\nexpected to compete with the natural under peace conditions.\r\n\r\nThe problem of synthetic rubber has then been solved scientifically but\r\nnot industrially. It can be made but cannot be made to pay. The\r\ndifficulty is to find a cheap enough material to start with. We can make\r\nrubber out of potatoes--but potatoes have other uses. It would require\r\nmore land and more valuable land to raise the potatoes than to raise the\r\nrubber. We can get isoprene by the distillation of turpentine--but why\r\nnot bleed a rubber tree as well as a pine tree? Turpentine is neither\r\ncheap nor abundant enough. Any kind of wood, sawdust for instance, can\r\nbe utilized by converting the cellulose over into sugar and fermenting\r\nthis to alcohol, but the process is not likely to prove profitable.\r\nPetroleum when cracked up to make gasoline gives isoprene or other\r\ndouble-bond compounds that go over into some form of rubber.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting and most promising of all is the complete\r\ninorganic synthesis that dispenses with the aid of vegetation and starts\r\nwith coal and lime. These heated together in the electric furnace form\r\ncalcium carbide and this, as every automobilist knows, gives acetylene\r\nby contact with water. From this gas isoprene can be made and the\r\nisoprene converted into rubber by sodium, or acid or alkali or simple\r\nheating. Acetone, which is also made from acetylene, can be converted\r\ndirectly into rubber by fuming sulfuric acid. This seems to have been\r\nthe process chiefly used by the Germans during the war. Several carbide\r\nfactories were devoted to it. But the intermediate and by-products of\r\nthe process, such as alcohol, acetic acid and acetone, were in as much\r\ndemand for war purposes as rubber. The Germans made some rubber from\r\npitch imported from Sweden. They also found a useful substitute in\r\naluminum naphthenate made from Baku petroleum, for it is elastic and\r\nplastic and can be vulcanized.\r\n\r\nSo although rubber can be made in many different ways it is not\r\nprofitable to make it in any of them. We have to rely still upon the\r\nnatural product, but we can greatly improve upon the way nature produces\r\nit. When the call came for more rubber for the electrical and automobile\r\nindustries the first attempt to increase the supply was to put pressure\r\nupon the natives to bring in more of the latex. As a consequence the\r\ntrees were bled to death and sometimes also the natives. The Belgian\r\natrocities in the Congo shocked the civilized world and at Putumayo on\r\nthe upper Amazon the same cause produced the same horrible effects. But\r\nno matter what cruelty was practiced the tropical forests could not be\r\nmade to yield a sufficient increase, so the cultivation of the rubber\r\nwas begun by far-sighted men in Dutch Java, Sumatra and Borneo and in\r\nBritish Malaya and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBrazil, feeling secure in the possession of a natural monopoly, made no\r\neffort to compete with these parvenus. It cost about as much to gather\r\nrubber from the Amazon forests as it did to raise it on a Malay\r\nplantation, that is, 25 cents a pound. The Brazilian Government clapped\r\non another 25 cents export duty and spent the money lavishly. In 1911\r\nthe treasury of Para took in $2,000,000 from the rubber tax and a good\r\nshare of the money was spent on a magnificent new theater at Manaos--not\r\non setting out rubber trees. The result of this rivalry between the\r\ncollector and the cultivator is shown by the fact that in the decade\r\n1907-1917 the world's output of plantation rubber increased from 1000 to\r\n204,000 tons, while the output of wild rubber decreased from 68,000 to\r\n53,000. Besides this the plantation rubber is a cleaner and more even\r\nproduct, carefully coagulated by acetic acid instead of being smoked\r\nover a forest fire. It comes in pale yellow sheets instead of big black\r\nballs loaded with the dirt or sticks and stones that the honest Indian\r\nsometimes adds to make a bigger lump. What's better, the man who milks\r\nthe rubber trees on a plantation may live at home where he can be\r\ndecently looked after. The agriculturist and the chemist may do what the\r\nphilanthropist and statesman could not accomplish: put an end to the\r\ncruelties involved in the international struggle for \"black gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States uses three-fourths of the world's rubber output and\r\ngrows none of it. What is the use of tropical possessions if we do not\r\nmake use of them? The Philippines could grow all our rubber and keep a\r\n$300,000,000 business under our flag. Santo Domingo, where rubber was\r\nfirst discovered, is now under our supervision and could be enriched by\r\nthe industry. The Guianas, where the rubber tree was first studied,\r\nmight be purchased. It is chiefly for lack of a definite colonial policy\r\nthat our rubber industry, by far the largest in the world, has to be\r\ndependent upon foreign sources for all its raw materials. Because the\r\nPhilippines are likely to be cast off at any moment, American\r\nmanufacturers are placing their plantations in the Dutch or British\r\npossessions. The Goodyear Company has secured a concession of 20,000\r\nacres near Medan in Dutch Sumatra.\r\n\r\nWhile the United States is planning to relinquish its Pacific\r\npossessions the British have more than doubled their holdings in New\r\nGuinea by the acquisition of Kaiser Wilhelm's Land, good rubber\r\ncountry. The British Malay States in 1917 exported over $118,000,000\r\nworth of plantation-grown rubber and could have sold more if shipping\r\nhad not been short and production restricted. Fully 90 per cent. of the\r\ncultivated rubber is now grown in British colonies or on British\r\nplantations in the Dutch East Indies. To protect this monopoly an act\r\nhas been passed preventing foreigners from buying more land in the Malay\r\nPeninsula. The Japanese have acquired there 50,000 acres, on which they\r\nare growing more than a million dollars' worth of rubber a year. The\r\nBritish _Tropical Life_ says of the American invasion: \"As America is so\r\nextremely wealthy Uncle Sam can well afford to continue to buy our\r\nrubber as he has been doing instead of coming in to produce rubber to\r\nreduce his competition as a buyer in the world's market.\" The Malaya\r\nestates calculate to pay a dividend of 20 per cent. on the investment\r\nwith rubber selling at 30 cents a pound and every two cents additional\r\non the price brings a further 3-1/2 per cent. dividend. The output is\r\nrestricted by the Rubber Growers' Association so as to keep the price up\r\nto 50-70 cents. When the plantations first came into bearing in 1910\r\nrubber was bringing nearly $3 a pound, and since it can be produced at\r\nless than 30 cents a pound we can imagine the profits of the early\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the world's rubber trade was in the control of Great\r\nBritain caused America great anxiety and financial loss in the early\r\npart of the war when the British Government, suspecting--not without\r\nreason--that some American rubber goods were getting into Germany\r\nthrough neutral nations, suddenly shut off our supply. This threatened\r\nto kill the fourth largest of our industries and it was only by the\r\nsubmission of American rubber dealers to the closest supervision and\r\nrestriction by the British authorities that they were allowed to\r\ncontinue their business. Sir Francis Hopwood, in laying down these\r\nregulations, gave emphatic warning \"that in case any manufacturer,\r\nimporter or dealer came under suspicion his permits should be\r\nimmediately revoked. Reinstatement will be slow and difficult. The\r\nBritish Government will cancel first and investigate afterward.\" Of\r\ncourse the British had a right to say under what conditions they should\r\nsell their rubber and we cannot blame them for taking such precautions\r\nto prevent its getting to their enemies, but it placed the United States\r\nin a humiliating position and if we had not been in sympathy with their\r\nside it would have aroused more resentment than it did. But it made\r\nevident the desirability of having at least part of our supply under our\r\nown control and, if possible, within our own country. Rubber is not rare\r\nin nature, for it is contained in almost every milky juice. Every\r\ncountry boy knows that he can get a self-feeding mucilage brush by\r\ncutting off a milkweed stalk. The only native source so far utilized is\r\nthe guayule, which grows wild on the deserts of the Mexican and the\r\nAmerican border. The plant was discovered in 1852 by Dr. J.M. Bigelow\r\nnear Escondido Creek, Texas. Professor Asa Gray described it and named\r\nit Parthenium argentatum, or the silver Pallas. When chopped up and\r\nmacerated guayule gives a satisfactory quality of caoutchouc in\r\nprofitable amounts. In 1911 seven thousand tons of guayule were\r\nimported from Mexico; in 1917 only seventeen hundred tons. Why this\r\nfalling off? Because the eager exploiters had killed the goose that laid\r\nthe golden egg, or in plain language, pulled up the plant by the roots.\r\nNow guayule is being cultivated and is reaped instead of being uprooted.\r\nExperiments at the Tucson laboratory have recently removed the\r\ndifficulty of getting the seed to germinate under cultivation. This\r\nseems the most promising of the home-grown plants and, until artificial\r\nrubber can be made profitable, gives us the only chance of being in part\r\nindependent of oversea supply.\r\n\r\nThere are various other gums found in nature that can for some purposes\r\nbe substituted for caoutchouc. Gutta percha, for instance, is pliable\r\nand tough though not very elastic. It becomes plastic by heat so it can\r\nbe molded, but unlike rubber it cannot be hardened by heating with\r\nsulfur. A lump of gutta percha was brought from Java in 1766 and placed\r\nin a British museum, where it lay for nearly a hundred years before it\r\noccurred to anybody to do anything with it except to look at it. But a\r\nGerman electrician, Siemens, discovered in 1847 that gutta percha was\r\nvaluable for insulating telegraph lines and it found extensive\r\nemployment in submarine cables as well as for golf balls, and the like.\r\n\r\nBalata, which is found in the forests of the Guianas, is between gutta\r\npercha and rubber, not so good for insulation but useful for shoe soles\r\nand machine belts. The bark of the tree is so thick that the latex does\r\nnot run off like caoutchouc when the bark is cut. So the bark has to be\r\ncut off and squeezed in hand presses. Formerly this meant cutting down\r\nthe tree, but now alternate strips of the bark are cut off and squeezed\r\nso the tree continues to live.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus discovered Santo Domingo he found the natives playing with\r\nballs made from the gum of the caoutchouc tree. The soldiers of Pizarro,\r\nwhen they conquered Inca-Land, adopted the Peruvian custom of smearing\r\ncaoutchouc over their coats to keep out the rain. A French scientist, M.\r\nde la Condamine, who went to South America to measure the earth, came\r\nback in 1745 with some specimens of caoutchouc from Para as well as\r\nquinine from Peru. The vessel on which he returned, the brig _Minerva_,\r\nhad a narrow escape from capture by an English cruiser, for Great\r\nBritain was jealous of any trespassing on her American sphere of\r\ninfluence. The Old World need not have waited for the discovery of the\r\nNew, for the rubber tree grows wild in Annam as well as Brazil, but none\r\nof the Asiatics seems to have discovered any of the many uses of the\r\njuice that exudes from breaks in the bark.\r\n\r\nThe first practical use that was made of it gave it the name that has\r\nstuck to it in English ever since. Magellan announced in 1772 that it\r\nwas good to remove pencil marks. A lump of it was sent over from France\r\nto Priestley, the clergyman chemist who discovered oxygen and was mobbed\r\nout of Manchester for being a republican and took refuge in\r\nPennsylvania. He cut the lump into little cubes and gave them to his\r\nfriends to eradicate their mistakes in writing or figuring. Then they\r\nasked him what the queer things were and he said that they were \"India\r\nrubbers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOREST RUBBER\r\n\r\nCompare this tropical tangle and gnarled trunk with the straight tree\r\nand cleared ground of the plantation. At the foot of the trunk are cups\r\ncollecting rubber juice.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANTATION RUBBER\r\n\r\nThis spiral cut draws off the milk as completely and quickly as possible\r\nwithout harming the tree. The man is pulling off a strip of coagulated\r\nrubber that clogs it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN MAKING GARDEN HOSE THE RUBBER IS FORMED INTO A TUBE\r\nBY THE MACHINE ON THE RIGHT AND COILED ON THE TABLE TO THE LEFT]\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian natives had used caoutchouc for water-proof clothing,\r\nshoes, bottles and syringes, but Europe was slow to take it up, for the\r\nstuff was too sticky and smelled too bad in hot weather to become\r\nfashionable in fastidious circles. In 1825 Mackintosh made his name\r\nimmortal by putting a layer of rubber between two cloths.\r\n\r\nA German chemist, Ludersdorf, discovered in 1832 that the gum could be\r\nhardened by treating it with sulfur dissolved in turpentine. But it was\r\nleft to a Yankee inventor, Charles Goodyear, of Connecticut, to work out\r\na practical solution of the problem. A friend of his, Hayward, told him\r\nthat it had been revealed to him in a dream that sulfur would harden\r\nrubber, but unfortunately the angel or defunct chemist who inspired the\r\nvision failed to reveal the details of the process. So Hayward sold out\r\nhis dream to Goodyear, who spent all his own money and all he could\r\nborrow from his friends trying to convert it into a reality. He worked\r\nfor ten years on the problem before the \"lucky accident\" came to him.\r\nOne day in 1839 he happened to drop on the hot stove of the kitchen that\r\nhe used as a laboratory a mixture of caoutchouc and sulfur. To his\r\nsurprise he saw the two substances fuse together into something new.\r\nInstead of the soft, tacky gum and the yellow, brittle brimstone he had\r\nthe tough, stable, elastic solid that has done so much since to make our\r\nfooting and wheeling safe, swift and noiseless. The gumshoes or galoshes\r\nthat he was then enabled to make still go by the name of \"rubbers\" in\r\nthis country, although we do not use them for pencil erasers.\r\n\r\nGoodyear found that he could vary this \"vulcanized rubber\" at will. By\r\nadding a little more sulfur he got a hard substance which, however,\r\ncould be softened by heat so as to be molded into any form wanted. Out\r\nof this \"hard rubber\" \"vulcanite\" or \"ebonite\" were made combs,\r\nhairpins, penholders and the like, and it has not yet been superseded\r\nfor some purposes by any of its recent rivals, the synthetic resins.\r\n\r\nThe new form of rubber made by the Germans, methyl rubber, is said to be\r\na superior substitute for the hard variety but not satisfactory for the\r\nsoft. The electrical resistance of the synthetic product is 20 per cent,\r\nhigher than the natural, so it is excellent for insulation, but it is\r\ninferior in elasticity. In the latter part of the war the methyl rubber\r\nwas manufactured at the rate of 165 tons a month.\r\n\r\nThe first pneumatic tires, known then as \"patent aerial wheels,\" were\r\ninvented by Robert William Thomson of London in 1846. On the following\r\nyear a carriage equipped with them was seen in the streets of New York\r\nCity. But the pneumatic tire did not come into use until after 1888,\r\nwhen an Irish horse-doctor, John Boyd Dunlop, of Belfast, tied a rubber\r\ntube around the wheels of his little son's velocipede. Within seven\r\nyears after that a $25,000,000 corporation was manufacturing Dunlop\r\ntires. Later America took the lead in this business. In 1913 the United\r\nStates exported $3,000,000 worth of tires and tubes. In 1917 the\r\nAmerican exports rose to $13,000,000, not counting what went to the\r\nAllies. The number of pneumatic tires sold in 1917 is estimated at\r\n18,000,000, which at an average cost of $25 would amount to\r\n$450,000,000.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much synthetic rubber may be manufactured or how many\r\nrubber trees are set out there is no danger of glutting the market, for\r\nas the price falls the uses of rubber become more numerous. One can\r\nthink of a thousand ways in which rubber could be used if it were only\r\ncheap enough. In the form of pads and springs and tires it would do much\r\nto render traffic noiseless. Even the elevated railroad and the subway\r\nmight be opened to conversation, and the city made habitable for mild\r\nvoiced and gentle folk. It would make one's step sure, noiseless and\r\nspringy, whether it was used individualistically as rubber heels or\r\ncollectivistically as carpeting and paving. In roofing and siding and\r\npaint it would make our buildings warmer and more durable. It would\r\nreduce the cost and permit the extension of electrical appliances of\r\nalmost all kinds. In short, there is hardly any other material whose\r\nabundance would contribute more to our comfort and convenience. Noise is\r\nan automatic alarm indicating lost motion and wasted energy. Silence is\r\neconomy and resiliency is superior to resistance. A gumshoe outlasts a\r\nhobnailed sole and a rubber tube full of air is better than a steel\r\ntire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE RIVAL SUGARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks, being an inquisitive and acquisitive people, were\r\nfond of collecting tales of strange lands. They did not care much\r\nwhether the stories were true or not so long as they were interesting.\r\nAmong the marvels that the Greeks heard from the Far East two of the\r\nstrangest were that in India there were plants that bore wool without\r\nsheep and reeds that bore honey without bees. These incredible tales\r\nturned out to be true and in the course of time Europe began to get a\r\nlittle calico from Calicut and a kind of edible gravel that the Arabs\r\nwho brought it called \"sukkar.\" But of course only kings and queens\r\ncould afford to dress in calico and have sugar prescribed for them when\r\nthey were sick.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, in the course of time the Arabs invaded Spain and\r\nforced upon the unwilling inhabitants of Europe such instrumentalities\r\nof higher civilization as arithmetic and algebra, soap and sugar. Later\r\nthe Spaniards by an act of equally unwarranted and beneficent aggression\r\ncarried the sugar cane to the Caribbean, where it thrived amazingly. The\r\nWest Indies then became a rival of the East Indies as a treasure-house\r\nof tropical wealth and for several centuries the Spanish, Portuguese,\r\nDutch, English, Danes and French fought like wildcats to gain possession\r\nof this little nest of islands and the routes leading thereunto.\r\n\r\nThe English finally overcame all these enemies, whether they fought her\r\nsingly or combined. Great Britain became mistress of the seas and took\r\nsuch Caribbean lands as she wanted. But in the end her continental foes\r\ncame out ahead, for they rendered her victory valueless. They were\r\ndefeated in geography but they won in chemistry. Canning boasted that\r\n\"the New World had been called into existence to redress the balance of\r\nthe Old.\" Napoleon might have boasted that he had called in the sugar\r\nbeet to balance the sugar cane. France was then, as Germany was a\r\ncentury later, threatening to dominate the world. England, then as in\r\nthe Great War, shut off from the seas the shipping of the aggressive\r\npower. France then, like Germany later, felt most keenly the lack of\r\ntropical products, chief among which, then but not in the recent crisis,\r\nwas sugar. The cause of this vital change is that in 1747 Marggraf, a\r\nBerlin chemist, discovered that it was possible to extract sugar from\r\nbeets. There was only a little sugar in the beet root then, some six per\r\ncent., and what he got out was dirty and bitter. One of his pupils in\r\n1801 set up a beet sugar factory near Breslau under the patronage of the\r\nKing of Prussia, but the industry was not a success until Napoleon took\r\nit up and in 1810 offered a prize of a million francs for a practical\r\nprocess. How the French did make fun of him for this crazy notion! In a\r\ncomic paper of that day you will find a cartoon of Napoleon in the\r\nnursery beside the cradle of his son and heir, the King of Rome--known\r\nto the readers of Rostand as l'Aiglon. The Emperor is squeezing the\r\njuice of a beet into his coffee and the nurse has put a beet into the\r\nmouth of the infant King, saying: \"Suck, dear, suck. Your father says\r\nit's sugar.\"\r\n\r\nIn like manner did the wits ridicule Franklin for fooling with\r\nelectricity, Rumford for trying to improve chimneys, Parmentier for\r\nthinking potatoes were fit to eat, and Jefferson for believing that\r\nsomething might be made of the country west of the Mississippi. In all\r\nages ridicule has been the chief weapon of conservatism. If you want to\r\nknow what line human progress will take in the future read the funny\r\npapers of today and see what they are fighting. The satire of every\r\ncentury from Aristophanes to the latest vaudeville has been directed\r\nagainst those who are trying to make the world wiser or better, against\r\nthe teacher and the preacher, the scientist and the reformer.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the ridicule showered upon it the despised beet year by year\r\ngained in sweetness of heart. The percentage of sugar rose from six to\r\neighteen and by improved methods of extraction became finally as pure\r\nand palatable as the sugar of the cane. An acre of German beets produces\r\nmore sugar than an acre of Louisiana cane. Continental Europe waxed\r\nwealthy while the British West Indies sank into decay. As the beets of\r\nEurope became sweeter the population of the islands became blacker.\r\nBefore the war England was paying out $125,000,000 for sugar, and more\r\nthan two-thirds of this money was going to Germany and Austria-Hungary.\r\nFostered by scientific study, protected by tariff duties, and stimulated\r\nby export bounties, the beet sugar industry became one of the financial\r\nforces of the world. The English at home, especially the\r\nmarmalade-makers, at first rejoiced at the idea of getting sugar for\r\nless than cost at the expense of her continental rivals. But the\r\nsuffering colonies took another view of the situation. In 1888 a\r\nconference of the powers called at London agreed to stop competing by\r\nthe pernicious practice of export bounties, but France and the United\r\nStates refused to enter, so the agreement fell through. Another\r\nconference ten years later likewise failed, but when the parvenu beet\r\nsugar ventured to invade the historic home of the cane the limit of\r\ntoleration had been reached. The Council of India put on countervailing\r\nduties to protect their homegrown cane from the bounty-fed beet. This\r\nforced the calling of a convention at Brussels in 1903 \"to equalize the\r\nconditions of competition between beet sugar and cane sugar of the\r\nvarious countries,\" at which the powers agreed to a mutual suppression\r\nof bounties. Beet sugar then divided the world's market equally with\r\ncane sugar and the two rivals stayed substantially neck and neck until\r\nthe Great War came. This shut out from England the product of Germany,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Belgium, northern France and Russia and took the\r\nfarmers from their fields. The battle lines of the Central Powers\r\nenclosed the land which used to grow a third of the world's supply of\r\nsugar. In 1913 the beet and the cane each supplied about nine million\r\ntons of sugar. In 1917 the output of cane sugar was 11,200,000 and of\r\nbeet sugar 5,300,000 tons. Consequently the Old World had to draw upon\r\nthe New. Cuba, on which the United States used to depend for half its\r\nsugar supply, sent over 700,000 tons of raw sugar to England in 1916.\r\nThe United States sent as much more refined sugar. The lack of shipping\r\ninterfered with our getting sugar from our tropical dependencies,\r\nHawaii, Porto Rico and the Philippines. The homegrown beets give us only\r\na fifth and the cane of Louisiana and Texas only a fifteenth of the\r\nsugar we need. As a result we were obliged to file a claim in advance to\r\nget a pound of sugar from the corner grocery and then we were apt to be\r\nput off with rock candy, muscovado or honey. Lemon drops proved useful\r\nfor Russian tea and the \"long sweetening\" of our forefathers came again\r\ninto vogue in the form of various syrups. The United States was\r\naccustomed to consume almost a fifth of all the sugar produced in the\r\nworld--and then we could not get it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF EUROPEAN BEET SUGAR\r\nFACTORIES--ALSO BATTLE LINES AT CLOSE OF 1918 ESTIMATED THAT ONE-THIRD\r\nOF WORLDS PRODUCTION BEFORE THE WAR WAS PRODUCED WITHIN BATTLE LINES\r\nCourtesy American Sugar Refining Co.]\r\n\r\nThe shortage made us realize how dependent we have become upon sugar.\r\nYet it was, as we have seen, practically unknown to the ancients and\r\nonly within the present generation has it become an essential factor in\r\nour diet. As soon as the chemist made it possible to produce sugar at a\r\nreasonable price all nations began to buy it in proportion to their\r\nmeans. Americans, as the wealthiest people in the world, ate the most,\r\nninety pounds a year on the average for every man, woman and child. In\r\nother words we ate our weight of sugar every year. The English consumed\r\nnearly as much as the Americans; the French and Germans about half as\r\nmuch; the Balkan peoples less than ten pounds per annum; and the African\r\nsavages none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the sugar beet has gained enormously in sugar content\r\nunder chemical control]\r\n\r\nPure white sugar is the first and greatest contribution of chemistry to\r\nthe world's dietary. It is unique in being a single definite chemical\r\ncompound, sucrose, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}. All natural nutriments are more\r\nor less complex mixtures. Many of them, like wheat or milk or fruit,\r\ncontain in various proportions all of the three factors of foods, the\r\nfats, the proteids and the carbohydrates, as well as water and the\r\nminerals and other ingredients necessary to life. But sugar is a simple\r\nsubstance, like water or salt, and like them is incapable of sustaining\r\nlife alone, although unlike them it is nutritious. In fact, except the\r\nfats there is no more nutritious food than sugar, pound for pound, for\r\nit contains no water and no waste. It is therefore the quickest and\r\nusually the cheapest means of supplying bodily energy. But as may be\r\nseen from its formula as given above it contains only three elements,\r\ncarbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and omits nitrogen and other elements\r\nnecessary to the body. An engine requires not only coal but also\r\nlubricating oil, water and bits of steel and brass to keep it in repair.\r\nBut as a source of the energy needed in our strenuous life sugar has no\r\nequal and only one rival, alcohol. Alcohol is the offspring of sugar, a\r\ndegenerate descendant that retains but few of the good qualities of its\r\nsire and has acquired some evil traits of its own. Alcohol, like sugar,\r\nmay serve to furnish the energy of a steam engine or a human body. Used\r\nas a fuel alcohol has certain advantages, but used as a food it has the\r\ndisqualification of deranging the bodily mechanism. Even a little\r\nalcohol will impair the accuracy and speed of thought and action, while\r\na large quantity, as we all know from observation if not experience,\r\nwill produce temporary incapacitation.\r\n\r\nWhen man feeds on sugar he splits it up by the aid of air into water and\r\ncarbon dioxide in this fashion:\r\n\r\n  C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} +  12O_{2}   -->   11H_{2}O  + 12CO_{2}\r\n        cane sugar     oxygen           water      carbon dioxide\r\n\r\nWhen sugar is burned the reaction is just the same.\r\n\r\nBut when the yeast plant feeds on sugar it carries the process only part\r\nway and instead of water the product is alcohol, a very different thing,\r\nso they say who have tried both as beverages. The yeast or fermentation\r\nreaction is this:\r\n\r\n  C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} +  H_{2}O   -->  4C_{2}H_{6}O   +  4CO_{2}\r\n        cane sugar      water         alcohol       carbon dioxide\r\n\r\nAlcohol then is the first product of the decomposition of sugar, a\r\ndangerous half-way house. The twin product, carbon dioxide or carbonic\r\nacid, is a gas of slightly sour taste which gives an attractive tang and\r\neffervescence to the beer, wine, cider or champagne. That is to say, one\r\nof these twins is a pestilential fellow and the other is decidedly\r\nagreeable. Yet for several thousand years mankind took to the first and\r\nlet the second for the most part escape into the air. But when the\r\nchemist appeared on the scene he discovered a way of separating the two\r\nand bottling the harmless one for those who prefer it. An increasing\r\nnumber of people were found to prefer it, so the American soda-water\r\nfountain is gradually driving Demon Rum out of the civilized world. The\r\nbrewer nowadays caters to two classes of customers. He bottles up the\r\nbeer with the alcohol and a little carbonic acid in it for the saloon\r\nand he catches the rest of the carbonic acid that he used to waste and\r\nsells it to the drug stores for soda-water or uses it to charge some\r\nnon-alcoholic beer of his own.\r\n\r\nThis catering to rival trades is not an uncommon thing with the chemist.\r\nAs we have seen, the synthetic perfumes are used to improve the natural\r\nperfumes. Cottonseed is separated into oil and meal; the oil going to\r\nmake margarin and the meal going to feed the cows that produce butter.\r\nSome people have been drinking coffee, although they do not like the\r\ntaste of it, because they want the stimulating effect of its alkaloid,\r\ncaffein. Other people liked the warmth and flavor of coffee but find\r\nthat caffein does not agree with them. Formerly one had to take the\r\ncoffee whole or let it alone. Now one can have his choice, for the\r\ncaffein is extracted for use in certain popular cold drinks and the rest\r\nof the bean sold as caffein-free coffee.\r\n\r\nMost of the \"soft drinks\" that are now gradually displacing the hard\r\nones consist of sugar, water and carbonic acid, with various flavors,\r\nchiefly the esters of the fatty and aromatic acids, such as I described\r\nin a previous chapter. These are still usually made from fruits and\r\nspices and in some cases the law or public opinion requires this, but\r\neventually, I presume, the synthetic flavors will displace the natural\r\nand then we shall get rid of such extraneous and indigestible matter as\r\nseeds, skins and bark. Suppose the world had always been used to\r\nsynthetic and hence seedless figs, strawberries and blackberries.\r\nSuppose then some manufacturer of fig paste or strawberry jam should put\r\nin ten per cent. of little round hard wooden nodules, just the sort to\r\nget stuck between the teeth or caught in the vermiform appendix. How\r\nlong would it be before he was sent to jail for adulterating food? But\r\nneither jail nor boycott has any reformatory effect on Nature.\r\n\r\nNature is quite human in that respect. But you can reform Nature as you\r\ncan human beings by looking out for heredity and culture. In this way\r\nMother Nature has been quite cured of her bad habit of putting seeds in\r\nbananas and oranges. Figs she still persists in adulterating with\r\nparticles of cellulose as nutritious as sawdust. But we can circumvent\r\nthe old lady at this. I got on Christmas a package of figs from\r\nCalifornia without a seed in them. Somebody had taken out all the\r\nseeds--it must have been a big job--and then put the figs together again\r\nas natural looking as life and very much better tasting.\r\n\r\nSugar and alcohol are both found in Nature; sugar in the ripe fruit,\r\nalcohol when it begins to decay. But it was the chemist who discovered\r\nhow to extract them. He first worked with alcohol and unfortunately\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the invention of the still by the Arabian chemists man could\r\nnot get drunk as quickly as he wanted to because his liquors were\r\nlimited to what the yeast plant could stand without intoxication. When\r\nthe alcoholic content of wine or beer rose to seventeen per cent. at the\r\nmost the process of fermentation stopped because the yeast plants got\r\ndrunk and quit \"working.\" That meant that a man confined to ordinary\r\nwine or beer had to drink ten or twenty quarts of water to get one\r\nquart of the stuff he was after, and he had no liking for water.\r\n\r\nSo the chemist helped him out of this difficulty and got him into worse\r\ntrouble by distilling the wine. The more volatile part that came over\r\nfirst contained the flavor and most of the alcohol. In this way he could\r\nget liquors like brandy and whisky, rum and gin, containing from thirty\r\nto eighty per cent. of alcohol. This was the origin of the modern liquor\r\nproblem. The wine of the ancients was strong enough to knock out Noah\r\nand put the companions of Socrates under the table, but it was not until\r\ndistilled liquors came in that alcoholism became chronic, epidemic and\r\nruinous to whole populations.\r\n\r\nBut the chemist later tried to undo the ruin he had quite inadvertently\r\nwrought by introducing alcohol into the world. One of his most\r\nsuccessful measures was the production of cheap and pure sugar which, as\r\nwe have seen, has become a large factor in the dietary of civilized\r\ncountries. As a country sobers up it takes to sugar as a \"self-starter\"\r\nto provide the energy needed for the strenuous life. A five o'clock\r\ncandy is a better restorative than a five o'clock highball or even a\r\nfive o'clock tea, for it is a true nutrient instead of a mere stimulant.\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that those who like sweets usually\r\ndo not like alcohol. Women, for instance, are apt to eat candy but do\r\nnot commonly take to alcoholic beverages. Look around you at a banquet\r\ntable and you will generally find that those who turn down their wine\r\nglasses generally take two lumps in their demi-tasses. We often hear it\r\nsaid that whenever a candy store opens up a saloon in the same block\r\ncloses up. Our grandmothers used to warn their daughters: \"Don't marry a\r\nman who does not want sugar in his tea. He is likely to take to drink.\"\r\nSo, young man, when next you give a box of candy to your best girl and\r\nshe offers you some, don't decline it. Eat it and pretend to like it, at\r\nleast, for it is quite possible that she looked into a physiology and is\r\ntrying you out. You never can tell what girls are up to.\r\n\r\nIn the army and navy ration the same change has taken place as in the\r\npopular dietary. The ration of rum has been mostly replaced by an\r\nequivalent amount of candy or marmalade. Instead of the tippling trooper\r\nof former days we have \"the chocolate soldier.\" No previous war in\r\nhistory has been fought so largely on sugar and so little on alcohol as\r\nthe last one. When the war reduced the supply and increased the demand\r\nwe all felt the sugar famine and it became a mark of patriotism to\r\nrefuse candy and to drink coffee unsweetened. This, however, is not, as\r\nsome think, the mere curtailment of a superfluous or harmful luxury, the\r\nsacrifice of a pleasant sensation. It is a real deprivation and a\r\nserious loss to national nutrition. For there is no reason to think the\r\nconstantly rising curve of sugar consumption has yet reached its maximum\r\nor optimum. Individuals overeat, but not the population as a whole.\r\nAccording to experiments of the Department of Agriculture men doing\r\nheavy labor may add three-quarters of a pound of sugar to their daily\r\ndiet without any deleterious effects. This is at the rate of 275 pounds\r\na year, which is three times the average consumption of England and\r\nAmerica. But the Department does not state how much a girl doing\r\nnothing ought to eat between meals.\r\n\r\nOf the 2500 to 3500 calories of energy required to keep a man going for\r\na day the best source of supply is the carbohydrates, that is, the\r\nsugars and starches. The fats are more concentrated but are more\r\nexpensive and less easily assimilable. The proteins are also more\r\nexpensive and their decomposition products are more apt to clog up the\r\nsystem. Common sugar is almost an ideal food. Cheap, clean, white,\r\nportable, imperishable, unadulterated, pleasant-tasting, germ-free,\r\nhighly nutritious, completely soluble, altogether digestible, easily\r\nassimilable, requires no cooking and leaves no residue. Its only fault\r\nis its perfection. It is so pure that a man cannot live on it. Four\r\nsquare lumps give one hundred calories of energy. But twenty-five or\r\nthirty-five times that amount would not constitute a day's ration, in\r\nfact one would ultimately starve on such fare. It would be like\r\nsupplying an army with an abundance of powder but neglecting to provide\r\nany bullets, clothing or food. To make sugar the sole food is\r\nimpossible. To make it the main food is unwise. It is quite proper for\r\nman to separate out the distinct ingredients of natural products--to\r\nextract the butter from the milk, the casein from the cheese, the sugar\r\nfrom the cane--but he must not forget to combine them again at each meal\r\nwith the other essential foodstuffs in their proper proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIVAL SUGARS The sugar beet of the north has become\r\na close rival of the sugar cane of the south]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A SUGAR MILL SHOWING THE MACHINERY FOR\r\nCRUSHING CANE TO EXTRACT THE JUICE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of American Sugar Refinery Co.\r\n\r\nVACUUM PANS OF THE AMERICAN SUGAR REFINERY COMPANY\r\n\r\nIn these air-tight vats the water is boiled off from the cane juice\r\nunder diminished atmospheric pressure until the sugar crystallizes out]\r\n\r\nSugar is not a synthetic product and the business of the chemist has\r\nbeen merely to extract and purify it. But this is not so simple as it\r\nseems and every sugar factory has had to have its chemist. He has\r\nanalyzed every mother beet for a hundred years. He has watched every\r\nstep of the process from the cane to the crystal lest the sucrose should\r\ninvert to the less sweet and non-crystallizable glucose. He has tested\r\nwith polarized light every shipment of sugar that has passed through the\r\ncustom house, much to the mystification of congressmen who have often\r\nwondered at the money and argumentation expended in a tariff discussion\r\nover the question of the precise angle of rotation of the plane of\r\nvibration of infinitesimal waves in a hypothetical ether.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this painstaking is that there are dozens of different\r\nsugars, so much alike that they are difficult to separate. They are all\r\ncomposed of the same three elements, C, H and O, and often in the same\r\nproportion. Sometimes two sugars differ only in that one has a\r\nright-handed and the other a left-handed twist to its molecule. They\r\nbear the same resemblance to one another as the two gloves of a pair.\r\nCane sugar and beet sugar are when completely purified the same\r\nsubstance, that is, sucrose, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}. The brown and\r\nstraw-colored sugars, which our forefathers used and which we took to\r\nusing during the war, are essentially the same but have not been so\r\ncompletely freed from moisture and the coloring and flavoring matter of\r\nthe cane juice. Maple sugar is mostly sucrose. So partly is honey.\r\nCandies are made chiefly of sucrose with the addition of glucose, gums\r\nor starch, to give them the necessary consistency and of such colors and\r\nflavors, natural or synthetic, as may be desired. Practically all candy,\r\neven the cheapest, is nowadays free from deleterious ingredients in the\r\nmanufacture, though it is liable to become contaminated in the handling.\r\nIn fact sugar is about the only food that is never adulterated. It would\r\nbe hard to find anything cheaper to add to it that would not be easily\r\ndetected. \"Sanding the sugar,\" the crime of which grocers are generally\r\naccused, is the one they are least likely to be guilty of.\r\n\r\nBesides the big family of sugars which are all more or less sweet,\r\nsimilar in structure and about equally nutritious, there are, very\r\ncuriously, other chemical compounds of altogether different composition\r\nwhich taste like sugar but are not nutritious at all. One of these is\r\na coal-tar derivative, discovered accidentally by an American student\r\nof chemistry, Ira Remsen, afterward president of Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, and named by him \"saccharin.\" This has the composition\r\nC_{6}H_{4}COSO_{2}NH, and as you may observe from the symbol it contains\r\nsulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) and the benzene ring (C_{6}H_{4}) that are\r\nnot found in any of the sugars. It is several hundred times sweeter than\r\nsugar, though it has also a slightly bitter aftertaste. A minute\r\nquantity of it can therefore take the place of a large amount of sugar\r\nin syrups, candies and preserves, so because it lends itself readily to\r\ndeception its use in food has been prohibited in the United States and\r\nother countries. But during the war, on account of the shortage of\r\nsugar, it came again into use. The European governments encouraged what\r\nthey formerly tried to prevent, and it became customary in Germany or\r\nItaly to carry about a package of saccharin tablets in the pocket and\r\ndrop one or two into the tea or coffee. Such reversals of administrative\r\nattitude are not uncommon. When the use of hops in beer was new it was\r\nprohibited by British law. But hops became customary nevertheless and\r\nnow the law requires hops to be used in beer. When workingmen first\r\nwanted to form unions, laws were passed to prevent them. But now, in\r\nAustralia for instance, the laws require workingmen to form unions.\r\nGovernments naturally tend to a conservative reaction against anything\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to turn back to the pure food agitation of ten years ago\r\nand read the sensational articles in the newspapers about the poisonous\r\nnature of this dangerous drug, saccharin, in view of the fact that it is\r\nbeing used by millions of people in Europe in amounts greater than once\r\nseemed to upset the tender stomachs of the Washington \"poison squads.\"\r\nBut saccharin does not appear to be responsible for any fatalities yet,\r\nthough people are said to be heartily sick of it. And well they may be,\r\nfor it is not a substitute for sugar except to the sense of taste.\r\nGlucose may correctly be called a substitute for sucrose as margarin for\r\nbutter, since they not only taste much the same but have about the same\r\nfood value. But to serve saccharin in the place of sugar is like giving\r\na rubber bone to a dog. It is reported from Europe that the constant use\r\nof saccharin gives one eventually a distaste for all sweets. This is\r\nquite likely, although it means the reversal within a few years of\r\nprehistoric food habits. Mankind has always associated sweetness with\r\nfood value, for there are few sweet things found in nature except the\r\nsugars. We think we eat sugar because it is sweet. But we do not. We eat\r\nit because it is good for us. The reason it tastes sweet to us is\r\nbecause it is good for us. So man makes a virtue out of necessity, a\r\npleasure out of duty, which is the essence of ethics.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient days of Ind the great Raja Trishanku possessed an earthly\r\nparadise that had been constructed for his delectation by a magician.\r\nTherein grew all manner of beautiful flowers, savory herbs and delicious\r\nfruits such as had never been known before outside heaven. Of them all\r\nthe Raja and his harems liked none better than the reed from which they\r\ncould suck honey. But Indra, being a jealous god, was wroth when he\r\nlooked down and beheld mere mortals enjoying such delights. So he willed\r\nthe destruction of the enchanted garden. With drought and tempest it was\r\ndevastated, with fire and hail, until not a leaf was left of its\r\nluxuriant vegetation and the ground was bare as a threshing floor. But\r\nthe roots of the sugar cane are not destroyed though the stalk be cut\r\ndown; so when men ventured to enter the desert where once had been this\r\ngarden of Eden, they found the cane had grown up again and they carried\r\naway cuttings of it and cultivated it in their gardens. Thus it happened\r\nthat the nectar of the gods descended first to monarchs and their\r\nfavorites, then was spread among the people and carried abroad to other\r\nlands until now any child with a penny in his hand may buy of the best\r\nof it. So it has been with many things. So may it be with all things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nWHAT COMES FROM CORN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America dowered mankind with a world of new flora. The\r\nearly explorers in their haste to gather up gold paid little attention\r\nto the more valuable products of field and forest, but in the course of\r\ncenturies their usefulness has become universally recognized. The potato\r\nand tomato, which Europe at first considered as unfit for food or even\r\nas poisonous, have now become indispensable among all classes. New World\r\ndrugs like quinine and cocaine have been adopted into every\r\npharmacopeia. Cocoa is proving a rival of tea and coffee, and even the\r\nbanana has made its appearance in European markets. Tobacco and chicle\r\noccupy the nostrils and jaws of a large part of the human race. Maize\r\nand rubber are become the common property of mankind, but still may be\r\ncalled American. The United States alone raises four-fifths of the corn\r\nand uses three-fourths of the caoutchouc of the world.\r\n\r\nAll flesh is grass. This may be taken in a dietary as well as a\r\nmetaphorical sense. The graminaceae provide the greater part of the\r\nsustenance of man and beast; hay and cereals, wheat, oats, rye, barley,\r\nrice, sugar cane, sorghum and corn. From an American viewpoint the\r\ngreatest of these, physically and financially, is corn. The corn crop of\r\nthe United States for 1917, amounting to 3,159,000,000 bushels, brought\r\nin more money than the wheat, cotton, potato and rye crops all\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus reached the West Indies he found the savages playing with\r\nrubber balls, smoking incense sticks of tobacco and eating cakes made of\r\na new grain that they called _mahiz_. When Pizarro invaded Peru he found\r\nthis same cereal used by the natives not only for food but also for\r\nmaking alcoholic liquor, in spite of the efforts of the Incas to enforce\r\nprohibition. When the Pilgrim Fathers penetrated into the woods back of\r\nPlymouth Harbor they discovered a cache of Indian corn. So throughout\r\nthe three Americas, from Canada to Peru, corn was king and it has proved\r\nworthy to rank with the rival cereals of other continents, the wheat of\r\nEurope and the rice of Asia. But food habits are hard to change and for\r\nthe most part the people of the Old World are still ignorant of the\r\ndelights of hasty pudding and Indian pudding, of hoe-cake and hominy, of\r\nsweet corn and popcorn. I remember thirty years ago seeing on a London\r\nstand a heap of dejected popcorn balls labeled \"Novel American\r\nConfection. Please Try One.\" But nobody complied with this pitiful\r\nappeal but me and I was sorry that I did. Americans used to respond with\r\na shipload of corn whenever an appeal came from famine sufferers in\r\nArmenia, Russia, Ireland, India or Austria, but their generosity was\r\nchilled when they found that their gift was resented as an insult or as\r\nan attempt to poison the impoverished population, who declared that they\r\nwould rather die than eat it--and some of them did. Our Department of\r\nAgriculture sent maize missionaries to Europe with farmers and millers\r\nas educators and expert cooks to serve free flapjacks and pones, but the\r\npropaganda made little impression and today Americans are urged to eat\r\nmore of their own corn because the famished families of the war-stricken\r\nregion will not touch it. Just so the beggars of Munich revolted at\r\npotato soup when the pioneer of American food chemists, Bumford,\r\nattempted to introduce this transatlantic dish.\r\n\r\nBut here we are not so much concerned with corn foods as we are with its\r\nmanufactured products. If you split a kernel in two you will find that\r\nit consists of three parts: a hard and horny hull on the outside, a\r\nsmall oily and nitrogenous germ at the point, and a white body\r\nconsisting mostly of starch. Each of these is worked up into various\r\nproducts, as may be seen from the accompanying table. The hull forms\r\nbran and may be mixed with the gluten as a cattle food. The corn steeped\r\nfor several days with sulfurous acid is disintegrated and on being\r\nground the germs are floated off, the gluten or nitrogenous portion\r\nwashed out, the starch grains settled down and the residue pressed\r\ntogether as oil cake fodder. The refined oil from the germ is marketed\r\nas a table or cooking oil under the name of \"Mazola\" and comes into\r\ncompetition with olive, peanut and cottonseed oil in the making of\r\nvegetable substitutes for lard and butter. Inferior grades may be used\r\nfor soaps or for glycerin and perhaps nitroglycerin. A bushel of corn\r\nyields a pound or more of oil. From the corn germ also is extracted a\r\ngum called \"paragol\" that forms an acceptable substitute for rubber in\r\ncertain uses. The \"red rubber\" sponges and the eraser tips to pencils\r\nmay be made of it and it can contribute some twenty per cent. to the\r\nsynthetic soles of shoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORN PRODUCTS]\r\n\r\nStarch, which constitutes fifty-five per cent. of the corn kernel, can\r\nbe converted into a variety of products for dietary and industrial uses.\r\nAs found in corn, potatoes or any other vegetables starch consists of\r\nsmall, round, white, hard grains, tasteless, and insoluble in cold\r\nwater. But hot water converts it into a soluble, sticky form which may\r\nserve for starching clothes or making cornstarch pudding. Carrying the\r\nprocess further with the aid of a little acid or other catalyst it takes\r\nup water and goes over into a sugar, dextrose, commonly called\r\n\"glucose.\" Expressed in chemical shorthand this reaction is\r\n\r\n  C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} + H_{2}O   -->  C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\r\n         starch      water          dextrose\r\n\r\nThis reaction is carried out on forty million bushels of corn a year in\r\nthe United States. The \"starch milk,\" that is, the starch grains washed\r\nout from the disintegrated corn kernel by water, is digested in large\r\npressure tanks under fifty pounds of steam with a few tenths of one per\r\ncent. of hydrochloric acid until the required degree of conversion is\r\nreached. Then the remaining acid is neutralized by caustic soda, and\r\nthereby converted into common salt, which in this small amount does not\r\ninterfere but rather enhances the taste. The product is the commercial\r\nglucose or corn syrup, which may if desired be evaporated to a white\r\npowder. It is a mixture of three derivatives of starch in about this\r\nproportion:\r\n\r\n  Maltose          45 per cent.\r\n  Dextrose         20 per cent.\r\n  Dextrin          35 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere are also present three- or four-tenths of one per cent. salt and\r\nas much of the corn protein and a variable amount of water. It will be\r\nnoticed that the glucose (dextrose), which gives name to the whole, is\r\nthe least of the three ingredients.\r\n\r\nMaltose, or malt sugar, has the same composition as cane sugar\r\n(C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}), but is not nearly so sweet. Dextrin, or starch\r\npaste, is not sweet at all. Dextrose or glucose is otherwise known; as\r\ngrape sugar, for it is commonly found in grapes and other ripe fruits.\r\nIt forms half of honey and it is one of the two products into which\r\ncane sugar splits up when we take it into the mouth. It is not so sweet\r\nas cane sugar and cannot be so readily crystallized, which, however, is\r\nnot altogether a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe process of changing starch into dextrose that takes place in the\r\ngreat steam kettles of the glucose factory is essentially the same as\r\nthat which takes place in the ripening of fruit and in the digestion of\r\nstarch. A large part of our nutriment, therefore, consists of glucose\r\neither eaten as such in ripe fruits or produced in the mouth or stomach\r\nby the decomposition of the starch of unripe fruit, vegetables and\r\ncereals. Glucose may be regarded as a predigested food. In spite of this\r\nwell-known fact we still sometimes read \"poor food\" articles in which\r\nglucose is denounced as a dangerous adulterant and even classed as a\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nThe other ingredients of commercial glucose, the maltose and dextrin,\r\nhave of course the same food value as the dextrose, since they are made\r\nover into dextrose in the process of digestion. Whether the glucose\r\nsyrup is fit to eat depends, like anything else, on how it is made. If,\r\nas was formerly sometimes the case, sulfuric acid was used to effect the\r\nconversion of the starch or sulfurous acid to bleach the glucose and\r\nthese acids were not altogether eliminated, the product might be\r\nunwholesome or worse. Some years ago in England there was a mysterious\r\nepidemic of arsenical poisoning among beer drinkers. On tracing it back\r\nit was found that the beer had been made from glucose which had been\r\nmade from sulfuric acid which had been made from sulfur which had been\r\nmade from a batch of iron pyrites which contained a little arsenic. The\r\nreplacement of sulfuric acid by hydrochloric has done away with that\r\ndanger and the glucose now produced is pure.\r\n\r\nThe old recipe for home-made candy called for the addition of a little\r\nvinegar to the sugar syrup to prevent \"graining.\" The purpose of the\r\nacid was of course to invert part of the cane sugar to glucose so as to\r\nkeep it from crystallizing out again. The professional candy-maker now\r\nuses the corn glucose for that purpose, so if we accuse him of\r\n\"adulteration\" on that ground we must levy the same accusation against\r\nour grandmothers. The introduction of glucose into candy manufacture has\r\nnot injured but greatly increased the sale of sugar for the same\r\npurpose. This is not an uncommon effect of scientific progress, for as\r\nwe have observed, the introduction of synthetic perfumes has stimulated\r\nthe production of odoriferous flowers and the price of butter has gone\r\nup with the introduction of margarin. So, too, there are more weavers\r\nemployed and they get higher wages than in the days when they smashed up\r\nthe first weaving machines, and the same is true of printers and\r\ntypesetting machines. The popular animosity displayed toward any new\r\nachievement of applied science is never justified, for it benefits not\r\nonly the world as a whole but usually even those interests with which it\r\nseems at first to conflict.\r\n\r\nThe chemist is an economizer. It is his special business to hunt up\r\nwaste products and make them useful. He was, for instance, worried over\r\nthe waste of the cores and skins and scraps that were being thrown away\r\nwhen apples were put up. Apple pulp contains pectin, which is what makes\r\njelly jell, and berries and fruits that are short of it will refuse to\r\n\"jell.\" But using these for their flavor he adds apple pulp for pectin\r\nand glucose for smoothness and sugar for sweetness and, if necessary,\r\nsynthetic dyes for color, he is able to put on the market a variety of\r\njellies, jams and marmalades at very low price. The same principle\r\napplies here as in the case of all compounded food products. If they are\r\nmade in cleanly fashion, contain no harmful ingredients and are\r\ntruthfully labeled there is no reason for objecting to them. But if the\r\nmanufacturer goes so far as to put strawberry seeds--or hayseed--into\r\nhis artificial \"strawberry jam\" I think that might properly be called\r\nadulteration, for it is imitating the imperfections of nature, and man\r\nought to be too proud to do that.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned open kettle molasses consisted mostly of glucose and\r\nother invert sugars together with such cane sugar as could not be\r\ncrystallized out. But when the vacuum pan was introduced the molasses\r\nwas impoverished of its sweetness and beet sugar does not yield any\r\nmolasses. So we now have in its place the corn syrups consisting of\r\nabout 85 per cent. of glucose and 15 per cent. of sugar flavored with\r\nmaple or vanillin or whatever we like. It is encouraging to see the bill\r\nboards proclaiming the virtues of \"Karo\" syrup and \"Mazola\" oil when\r\nonly a few years ago the products of our national cereal were without\r\nhonor in their own country.\r\n\r\nMany other products besides foods are made from corn starch. Dextrin\r\nserves in place of the old \"gum arabic\" for the mucilage of our\r\nenvelopes and stamps. Another form of dextrin sold as \"Kordex\" is used\r\nto hold together the sand of the cores of castings. After the casting\r\nhas been made the scorched core can be shaken out. Glucose is used in\r\nplace of sugar as a filler for cheap soaps and for leather.\r\n\r\nAltogether more than a hundred different commercial products are now\r\nmade from corn, not counting cob pipes. Every year the factories of the\r\nUnited States work up over 50,000,000 bushels of corn into 800,000,000\r\npounds of corn syrup, 600,000,000 pounds of starch, 230,000,000 pounds\r\nof corn sugar, 625,000,000 pounds of gluten feed, 90,000,000 pounds of\r\noil and 90,000,000 pounds of oil cake.\r\n\r\nTwo million bushels of cobs are wasted every year in the United States.\r\nCan't something be made out of them? This is the question that is\r\nagitating the chemists of the Carbohydrate Laboratory of the Department\r\nof Agriculture at Washington. They have found it possible to work up the\r\ncorn cobs into glucose and xylose by heating with acid. But glucose can\r\nbe more cheaply obtained from other starchy or woody materials and they\r\ncannot find a market for the xylose. This is a sort of a sugar but only\r\nabout half as sweet as that from cane. Who can invent a use for it! More\r\npromising is the discovery by this laboratory that by digesting the cobs\r\nwith hot water there can be extracted about 30 per cent. of a gum\r\nsuitable for bill posting and labeling.\r\n\r\nSince the starches and sugars belong to the same class of compounds as\r\nthe celluloses they also can be acted upon by nitric acid with the\r\nproduction of explosives like guncotton. Nitro-sugar has not come into\r\ncommon use, but nitro-starch is found to be one of safest of the high\r\nexplosives. On account of the danger of decomposition and spontaneous\r\nexplosion from the presence of foreign substances the materials in\r\nexplosives must be of the purest possible. It was formerly thought that\r\ntapioca must be imported from Java for making nitro-starch. But during\r\nthe war when shipping was short, the War Department found that it could\r\nbe made better and cheaper from our home-grown corn starch. When the war\r\nclosed the United States was making 1,720,000 pounds of nitro-starch a\r\nmonth for loading hand grenades. So, too, the Post Office Department\r\ndiscovered that it could use mucilage made of corn dextrin as well as\r\nthat which used to be made from tapioca. This is progress in the right\r\ndirection. It would be well to divert some of the energetic efforts now\r\ndevoted to the increase of commerce to the discovery of ways of reducing\r\nthe need for commerce by the development of home products. There is no\r\nmerit in simply hauling things around the world.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we saw how dextrose or glucose could be converted by\r\nfermentation into alcohol. Since corn starch, as we have seen, can be\r\nconverted into dextrose, it can serve as a source of alcohol. This was,\r\nin fact, one of the earliest misuses to which corn was put, and before\r\nthe war put a stop to it 34,000,000 bushels went into the making of\r\nwhiskey in the United States every year, not counting the moonshiners'\r\noutput. But even though we left off drinking whiskey the distillers\r\ncould still thrive. Mars is more thirsty than Bacchus. The output of\r\nwhiskey, denatured for industrial purposes, is more than three times\r\nwhat is was before the war, and the price has risen from 30 cents a\r\ngallon to 67 cents. This may make it profitable to utilize sugars,\r\nstarches and cellulose that formerly were out of the question. According\r\nto the calculations of the Forest Products Laboratory of Madison it\r\ncosts from 37 to 44 cents a gallon to make alcohol from corn, but it may\r\nbe made from sawdust at a cost of from 14 to 20 cents. This is not \"wood\r\nalcohol\" (that is, methyl alcohol, CH_{4}O) such as is made by the\r\ndestructive distillation of wood, but genuine \"grain alcohol\" (ethyl\r\nalcohol, C_{2}H_{6}O), such as is made by the fermentation of glucose or\r\nother sugar. The first step in the process is to digest the sawdust or\r\nchips with dilute sulfuric acid under heat and pressure. This converts\r\nthe cellulose (wood fiber) in large part into glucose (\"corn sugar\")\r\nwhich may be extracted by hot water in a diffusion battery as in\r\nextracting the sugar from beet chips. This glucose solution may then be\r\nfermented by yeast and the resulting alcohol distilled off. The process\r\nis perfectly practicable but has yet to be proved profitable. But the\r\nsulfite liquors of the paper mills are being worked up successfully into\r\nindustrial alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly approaching exhaustion of our oil fields which the war has\r\naccelerated leads us to look around to see what we can get to take the\r\nplace of gasoline. One of the most promising of the suggested\r\nsubstitutes is alcohol. The United States is exceptionally rich in\r\nmineral oil, but some countries, for instance England, Germany, France\r\nand Australia, have little or none. The Australian Advisory Council of\r\nScience, called to consider the problem, recommends alcohol for\r\nstationary engines and motor cars. Alcohol has the disadvantage of\r\nbeing less volatile than gasoline so it is hard to start up the engine\r\nfrom the cold. But the lower volatility and ignition point of alcohol\r\nare an advantage in that it can be put under a pressure of 150 pounds to\r\nthe square inch. A pound of gasoline contains fifty per cent. more\r\npotential energy than a pound of alcohol, but since the alcohol vapor\r\ncan be put under twice the compression of the gasoline and requires only\r\none-third the amount of air, the thermal efficiency of an alcohol engine\r\nmay be fifty per cent. higher than that of a gasoline engine. Alcohol\r\nalso has several other conveniences that can count in its favor. In the\r\ncase of incomplete combustion the cylinders are less likely to be\r\nclogged with carbon and the escaping gases do not have the offensive\r\nodor of the gasoline smoke. Alcohol does not ignite so easily as\r\ngasoline and the fire is more readily put out, for water thrown upon\r\nblazing alcohol dilutes it and puts out the flame while gasoline floats\r\non water and the fire is spread by it. It is possible to increase the\r\ninflammability of alcohol by mixing with it some hydrocarbon such as\r\ngasoline, benzene or acetylene. In the Taylor-White process the vapor\r\nfrom low-grade alcohol containing 17 per cent. water is passed over\r\ncalcium carbide. This takes out the water and adds acetylene gas, making\r\na suitable mixture for an internal combustion engine.\r\n\r\nAlcohol can be made from anything of a starchy, sugary or woody nature,\r\nthat is, from the main substance of all vegetation. If we start with\r\nwood (cellulose) we convert it first into sugar (glucose) and, of\r\ncourse, we could stop here and use it for food instead of carrying it\r\non into alcohol. This provides one factor of our food, the carbohydrate,\r\nbut by growing the yeast plants on glucose and feeding them with\r\nnitrates made from the air we can get the protein and fat. So it is\r\nquite possible to live on sawdust, although it would be too expensive a\r\ndiet for anybody but a millionaire, and he would not enjoy it. Glucose\r\nhas been made from formaldehyde and this in turn made from carbon,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, so the synthetic production of food from the\r\nelements is not such an absurdity as it was thought when Berthelot\r\nsuggested it half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the making of alcohol is to change the starch over\r\ninto sugar. This transformation is effected in the natural course of\r\nsprouting by which the insoluble starch stored up in the seed is\r\nconverted into the soluble glucose for the sap of the growing plant.\r\nThis malting process is that mainly made use of in the production of\r\nalcohol from grain. But there are other ways of effecting the change. It\r\nmay be done by heating with acid as we have seen, or according to a\r\nmethod now being developed the final conversion may be accomplished by\r\nmold instead of malt. In applying this method, known as the amylo\r\nprocess, to corn, the meal is mixed with twice its weight of water,\r\nacidified with hydrochloric acid and steamed. The mash is then cooled\r\ndown somewhat, diluted with sterilized water and innoculated with the\r\nmucor filaments. As the mash molds the starch is gradually changed over\r\nto glucose and if this is the product desired the process may be stopped\r\nat this point. But if alcohol is wanted yeast is added to ferment the\r\nsugar. By keeping it alkaline and treating with the proper bacteria a\r\nhigh yield of glycerin can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the fermentation process for making alcoholic liquors a little\r\nglycerin is produced as a by-product. Glycerin, otherwise called\r\nglycerol, is intermediate between sugar and alcohol. Its molecule\r\ncontains three carbon atoms, while glucose has six and alcohol two. It\r\nis possible to increase the yield of glycerin if desired by varying the\r\nform of fermentation. This was desired most earnestly in Germany during\r\nthe war, for the British blockade shut off the importation of the fats\r\nand oils from which the Germans extracted the glycerin for their\r\nnitroglycerin. Under pressure of this necessity they worked out a\r\nprocess of getting glycerin in quantity from sugar and, news of this\r\nbeing brought to this country by Dr. Alonzo Taylor, the United States\r\nTreasury Department set up a special laboratory to work out this\r\nproblem. John R. Eoff and other chemists working in this laboratory\r\nsucceeded in getting a yield of twenty per cent. of glycerin by\r\nfermenting black strap molasses or other syrup with California wine\r\nyeast. During the fermentation it is necessary to neutralize the acetic\r\nacid formed with sodium or calcium carbonate. It was estimated that\r\nglycerin could be made from waste sugars at about a quarter of its\r\nwar-time cost, but it is doubtful whether the process would be\r\nprofitable at normal prices.\r\n\r\nWe can, if we like, dispense with either yeast or bacteria in the\r\nproduction of glycerin. Glucose syrup suspended in oil under steam\r\npressure with finely divided nickel as a catalyst and treated with\r\nnascent hydrogen will take up the hydrogen and be converted into\r\nglycerin. But the yield is poor and the process expensive.\r\n\r\nFood serves substantially the same purpose in the body as fuel in the\r\nengine. It provides the energy for work. The carbohydrates, that is the\r\nsugars, starches and celluloses, can all be used as fuels and can\r\nall--even, as we have seen, the cellulose--be used as foods. The final\r\nproducts, water and carbon dioxide, are in both cases the same and\r\nnecessarily therefore the amount of energy produced is the same in the\r\nbody as in the engine. Corn is a good example of the equivalence of the\r\ntwo sources of energy. There are few better foods and no better fuels. I\r\ncan remember the good old days in Kansas when we had corn to burn. It\r\nwas both an economy and a luxury, for--at ten cents a bushel--it was\r\ncheaper than coal or wood and preferable to either at any price. The\r\nlong yellow ears, each wrapped in its own kindling, could be handled\r\nwithout crocking the fingers. Each kernel as it crackled sent out a\r\nblazing jet of oil and the cobs left a fine bed of coals for the corn\r\npopper to be shaken over. Driftwood and the pyrotechnic fuel they make\r\nnow by soaking sticks in strontium and copper salts cannot compare with\r\nthe old-fashioned corn-fed fire in beauty and the power of evoking\r\nvisions. Doubtless such luxury would be condemned as wicked nowadays,\r\nbut those who have known the calorific value of corn would find it hard\r\nto abandon it altogether, and I fancy that the Western farmer's wife,\r\nwhen she has an extra batch of baking to do, will still steal a few ears\r\nfrom the crib.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nSOLIDIFIED SUNSHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll life and all that life accomplishes depend upon the supply of solar\r\nenergy stored in the form of food. The chief sources of this vital\r\nenergy are the fats and the sugars. The former contain two and a quarter\r\ntimes the potential energy of the latter. Both, when completely\r\npurified, consist of nothing but carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; elements\r\nthat are to be found freely everywhere in air and water. So when the\r\nsunny southland exports fats and oils, starches and sugar, it is then\r\nsending away nothing material but what comes back to it in the next\r\nwind. What it is sending to the regions of more slanting sunshine is\r\nmerely some of the surplus of the radiant energy it has received so\r\nabundantly, compacted for convenience into a portable and edible form.\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters I have dealt with some of the uses of cotton, its\r\nemployment for cloth, for paper, for artificial fibers, for explosives,\r\nand for plastics. But I have ignored the thing that cotton is attached\r\nto and for which, in the economy of nature, the fibers are formed; that\r\nis, the seed. It is as though I had described the aeroplane and ignored\r\nthe aviator whom it was designed to carry. But in this neglect I am but\r\nfollowing the example of the human race, which for three thousand years\r\nused the fiber but made no use of the seed except to plant the next\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nJust as mankind is now divided into the two great classes, the\r\nwheat-eaters and the rice-eaters, so the ancient world was divided into\r\nthe wool-wearers and the cotton-wearers. The people of India wore\r\ncotton; the Europeans wore wool. When the Greeks under Alexander fought\r\ntheir way to the Far East they were surprised to find wool growing on\r\ntrees. Later travelers returning from Cathay told of the same marvel and\r\ntravelers who stayed at home and wrote about what they had not seen,\r\nlike Sir John Maundeville, misunderstood these reports and elaborated a\r\nlegend of a tree that bore live lambs as fruit. Here, for instance, is\r\nhow a French poetical botanist, Delacroix, described it in 1791, as\r\ntranslated from his Latin verse:\r\n\r\n  Upon a stalk is fixed a living brute,\r\n  A rooted plant bears quadruped for fruit;\r\n  It has a fleece, nor does it want for eyes,\r\n  And from its brows two wooly horns arise.\r\n  The rude and simple country people say\r\n  It is an animal that sleeps by day\r\n  And wakes at night, though rooted to the ground,\r\n  To feed on grass within its reach around.\r\n\r\nBut modern commerce broke down the barrier between East and West. A new\r\ncotton country, the best in the world, was discovered in America. Cotton\r\ninvaded England and after a hard fight, with fists as well as finance,\r\nwool was beaten in its chief stronghold. Cotton became King and the\r\nwool-sack in the House of Lords lost its symbolic significance.\r\n\r\nStill two-thirds of the cotton crop, the seed, was wasted and it is only\r\nwithin the last fifty years that methods of using it have been\r\ndeveloped to any extent.\r\n\r\nThe cotton crop of the United States for 1917 amounted to about\r\n11,000,000 bales of 500 pounds each. When the Great War broke out and no\r\ncotton could be exported to Germany and little to England the South was\r\nin despair, for cotton went down to five or six cents a pound. The\r\nnational Government, regardless of states' rights, was called upon for\r\naid and everybody was besought to \"buy a bale.\" Those who responded to\r\nthis patriotic appeal were well rewarded, for cotton rose as the war\r\nwent on and sold at twenty-nine cents a pound.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: PRODUCTS AND USES OF COTTONSEED]\r\n\r\nBut the chemist has added some $150,000,000 a year to the value of the\r\ncrop by discovering ways of utilizing the cottonseed that used to be\r\nthrown away or burned as fuel. The genealogical table of the progeny of\r\nthe cottonseed herewith printed will give some idea of their variety. If\r\nyou will examine a cottonseed you will see first that there is a fine\r\nfuzz of cotton fiber sticking to it. These linters can be removed by\r\nmachinery and used for any purpose where length of fiber is not\r\nessential. For instance, they may be nitrated as described in previous\r\narticles and used for making smokeless powder or celluloid.\r\n\r\nOn cutting open the seed you will observe that it consists of an oily,\r\nmealy kernel encased in a thin brown hull. The hulls, amounting to 700\r\nor 900 pounds in a ton of seed, were formerly burned. Now, however, they\r\nbring from $4 to $10 a ton because they can be ground up into\r\ncattle-feed or paper stock or used as fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe kernel of the cottonseed on being pressed yields a yellow oil and\r\nleaves a mealy cake. This last, mixed with the hulls, makes a good\r\nfodder for fattening cattle. Also, adding twenty-five per cent. of the\r\nrefined cottonseed meal to our war bread made it more nutritious and no\r\nless palatable. Cottonseed meal contains about forty per cent. of\r\nprotein and is therefore a highly concentrated and very valuable feeding\r\nstuff. Before the war we were exporting nearly half a million tons of\r\ncottonseed meal to Europe, chiefly to Germany and Denmark, where it is\r\nused for dairy cows. The British yeoman, his country's pride, has not\r\nyet been won over to the use of any such newfangled fodder and\r\nconsequently the British manufacturer could not compete with his\r\ncontinental rivals in the seed-crushing business, for he could not\r\ndispose of his meal-cake by-product as did they.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nCottonseed Oil As It Is Squeezed From The Seed By The Presses]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nCottonseed Oil As It Comes From The Compressors Flowing Out Of The\r\nFaucets\r\n\r\nWhen cold it is firm and white like lard]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the most valuable of the cottonseed products, the\r\noil. The seed contains about twenty per cent. of oil, most of which can\r\nbe squeezed out of the hot seeds by hydraulic pressure. It comes out as\r\na red liquid of a disagreeable odor. This is decolorized, deodorized and\r\notherwise purified in various ways: by treatment with alkalies or acids,\r\nby blowing air and steam through it, by shaking up with fuller's earth,\r\nby settling and filtering. The refined product is a yellow oil, suitable\r\nfor table use. Formerly, on account of the popular prejudice against any\r\nnovel food products, it used to masquerade as olive oil. Now, however,\r\nit boldly competes with its ancient rival in the lands of the olive tree\r\nand America ships some 700,000 barrels of cottonseed oil a year to the\r\nMediterranean. The Turkish Government tried to check the spread of\r\ncottonseed oil by calling it an adulterant and prohibiting its mixture\r\nwith olive oil. The result was that the sale of Turkish olive oil fell\r\noff because people found its flavor too strong when undiluted. Italy\r\nimports cottonseed oil and exports her olive oil. Denmark imports\r\ncottonseed meal and margarine and exports her butter.\r\n\r\nNorthern nations are accustomed to hard fats and do not take to oils for\r\ncooking or table use as do the southerners. Butter and lard are\r\npreferred to olive oil and ghee. But this does not rule out cottonseed.\r\nIt can be combined with the hard fats of animal or vegetable origin in\r\nmargarine or it may itself be hardened by hydrogen.\r\n\r\nTo understand this interesting reaction which is profoundly affecting\r\ninternational relations it will be necessary to dip into the chemistry\r\nof the subject. Here are the symbols of the chief ingredients of the\r\nfats and oils. Please look at them.\r\n\r\n  Linoleic acid       C_{18}H_{32}O_{2}\r\n  Oleic acid          C_{18}H_{34}O_{2}\r\n  Stearic acid        C_{18}H_{36}O_{2}\r\n\r\nDon't skip these because you have not studied chemistry. That's why I am\r\ngiving them to you. If you had studied chemistry you would know them\r\nwithout my telling. Just examine them and you will discover the secret.\r\nYou will see that all three are composed of the same elements, carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen. Notice next the number of atoms in each element as\r\nindicated by the little low figures on the right of each letter. You\r\nobserve that all three contain the same number of atoms of carbon and\r\noxygen but differ in the amount of hydrogen. This trifling difference in\r\ncomposition makes a great difference in behavior. The less the hydrogen\r\nthe lower the melting point. Or to say the same thing in other words,\r\nfatty substances low in hydrogen are apt to be liquids and those with a\r\nfull complement of hydrogen atoms are apt to be solids at the ordinary\r\ntemperature of the air. It is common to call the former \"oils\" and the\r\nlatter \"fats,\" but that implies too great a dissimilarity, for the\r\ndistinction depends on whether we are living in the tropics or the\r\narctic. It is better, therefore, to lump them all together and call\r\nthem \"soft fats\" and \"hard fats,\" respectively.\r\n\r\nFats of the third order, the stearic group, are called \"saturated\"\r\nbecause they have taken up all the hydrogen they can hold. Fats of the\r\nother two groups are called \"unsaturated.\" The first, which have the\r\nleast hydrogen, are the most eager for more. If hydrogen is not handy\r\nthey will take up other things, for instance oxygen. Linseed oil, which\r\nconsists largely, as the name implies, of linoleic acid, will absorb\r\noxygen on exposure to the air and become hard. That is why it is used in\r\npainting. Such oils are called \"drying\" oils, although the hardening\r\nprocess is not really drying, since they contain no water, but is\r\noxidation. The \"semi-drying oils,\" those that will harden somewhat on\r\nexposure to the air, include the oils of cottonseed, corn, sesame, soy\r\nbean and castor bean. Olive oil and peanut oil are \"non-drying\" and\r\ncontain oleic compounds (olein). The hard fats, such as stearin,\r\npalmitin and margarin, are mostly of animal origin, tallow and lard,\r\nthough coconut and palm oil contain a large proportion of such saturated\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nThough the chemist talks of the fatty \"acids,\" nobody else would call\r\nthem so because they are not sour. But they do behave like the acids in\r\nforming salts with bases. The alkali salts of the fatty acids are known\r\nto us as soaps. In the natural fats they exist not as free acids but as\r\nsalts of an organic base, glycerin, as I explained in a previous\r\nchapter. The natural fats and oils consist of complex mixtures of the\r\nglycerin compounds of these acids (known as olein, stearin, etc.), as\r\nwell as various others of a similar sort. If you will set a bottle of\r\nsalad oil in the ice-box you will see it separate into two parts. The\r\nwhite, crystalline solid that separates out is largely stearin. The part\r\nthat remains liquid is largely olein. You might separate them by\r\nfiltering it cold and if then you tried to sell the two products you\r\nwould find that the hard fat would bring a higher price than the oil,\r\neither for food or soap. If you tried to keep them you would find that\r\nthe hard fat kept neutral and \"sweet\" longer than the other. You may\r\nremember that the perfumes (as well as their odorous opposites) were\r\nmostly unsaturated compounds. So we find that it is the free and\r\nunsaturated fatty acids that cause butter and oil to become rank and\r\nrancid.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, we could make money if we could turn soft, unsaturated\r\nfats like olein into hard, saturated fats like stearin. Referring to the\r\nsymbols we see that all that is needed to effect the change is to get\r\nthe former to unite with hydrogen. This requires a little coaxing. The\r\ncoaxer is called a catalyst. A catalyst, as I have previously explained,\r\nis a substance that by its mere presence causes the union of two other\r\nsubstances that might otherwise remain separate. For that reason the\r\ncatalyst is referred to as \"a chemical parson.\" Finely divided metals\r\nhave a strong catalytic action. Platinum sponge is excellent but too\r\nexpensive. So in this case nickel is used. A nickel salt mixed with\r\ncharcoal or pumice is reduced to the metallic state by heating in a\r\ncurrent of hydrogen. Then it is dropped into the tank of oil and\r\nhydrogen gas is blown through. The hydrogen may be obtained by splitting\r\nwater into its two components, hydrogen and oxygen, by means of the\r\nelectrical current, or by passing steam over spongy iron which takes out\r\nthe oxygen. The stream of hydrogen blown through the hot oil converts\r\nthe linoleic acid to oleic and then the oleic into stearic. If you\r\nfigured up the weights from the symbols given above you would find that\r\nit takes about one pound of hydrogen to convert a hundred pounds of\r\nolein to stearin and the cost is only about one cent a pound. The nickel\r\nis unchanged and is easily separated. A trace of nickel may remain in\r\nthe product, but as it is very much less than the amount dissolved when\r\nfood is cooked in nickel-plated vessels it cannot be regarded as\r\nharmful.\r\n\r\nEven more unsaturated fats may be hydrogenated. Fish oil has hitherto\r\nbeen almost unusable because of its powerful and persistent odor. This\r\nis chiefly due to a fatty acid which properly bears the uneuphonious\r\nname of clupanodonic acid and has the composition of C_{18}H_{28}O_{2}.\r\nBy comparing this with the symbol of the odorless stearic acid,\r\nC_{18}H_{36}O_{2}, you will see that all the rank fish oil lacks to make\r\nit respectable is eight hydrogen atoms. A Japanese chemist, Tsujimoto,\r\nhas discovered how to add them and now the reformed fish oil under the\r\nnames of \"talgol\" and \"candelite\" serves for lubricant and even enters\r\nhigher circles as a soap or food.\r\n\r\nThis process of hardening fats by hydrogenation resulted from the\r\nexperiments of a French chemist, Professor Sabatier of Toulouse, in the\r\nlast years of the last century, but, as in many other cases, the Germans\r\nwere the first to take it up and profit by it. Before the war the copra\r\nor coconut oil from the British Asiatic colonies of India, Ceylon and\r\nMalaya went to Germany at the rate of $15,000,000 a year. The palm\r\nkernels grown in British West Africa were shipped, not to Liverpool, but\r\nto Hamburg, $19,000,000 worth annually. Here the oil was pressed out and\r\nused for margarin and the residual cake used for feeding cows produced\r\nbutter or for feeding hogs produced lard. Half of the copra raised in\r\nthe British possessions was sent to Germany and half of the oil from it\r\nwas resold to the British margarin candle and soap makers at a handsome\r\nprofit. The British chemists were not blind to this, but they could do\r\nnothing, first because the English politician was wedded to free trade,\r\nsecond, because the English farmer would not use oil cake for his stock.\r\nFrance was in a similar situation. Marseilles produced 15,500,000\r\ngallons of oil from peanuts grown largely in the French African\r\ncolonies--but shipped the oil-cake on to Hamburg. Meanwhile the Germans,\r\nin pursuit of their policy of attaining economic independence, were\r\nstriving to develop their own tropical territory. The subjects of King\r\nGeorge who because they had the misfortune to live in India were\r\nexcluded from the British South African dominions or mistreated when\r\nthey did come, were invited to come to German East Africa and set to\r\nraising peanuts in rivalry to French Senegal and British Coromandel.\r\nBefore the war Germany got half of the Egyptian cottonseed and half of\r\nthe Philippine copra. That is one of the reasons why German warships\r\ntried to check Dewey at Manila in 1898 and German troops tried to\r\nconquer Egypt in 1915.\r\n\r\nBut the tide of war set the other way and the German plantations of\r\npalmnuts and peanuts in Africa have come into British possession and\r\nnow the British Government is starting an educational campaign to teach\r\ntheir farmers to feed oil cake like the Germans and their people to eat\r\npeanuts like the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Germans shut off from the tropical fats supply were hard up for food\r\nand for soap, for lubricants and for munitions. Every person was given a\r\nfat card that reduced his weekly allowance to the minimum. Millers were\r\nrequired to remove the germs from their cereals and deliver them to the\r\nwar department. Children were set to gathering horse-chestnuts,\r\nelderberries, linden-balls, grape seeds, cherry stones and sunflower\r\nheads, for these contain from six to twenty per cent. of oil. Even the\r\nblue-bottle fly--hitherto an idle creature for whom Beelzebub found\r\nmischief--was conscripted into the national service and set to laying\r\neggs by the billion on fish refuse. Within a few days there is a crop of\r\nlarvae which, to quote the \"Chemische Zentralblatt,\" yields forty-five\r\ngrams per kilogram of a yellow oil. This product, we should hope, is\r\nused for axle-grease and nitroglycerin, although properly purified it\r\nwould be as nutritious as any other--to one who has no imagination.\r\nDriven to such straits Germany would have given a good deal for one of\r\nthose tropical islands that we are so careless about.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that since the United States possessed the\r\nbest land in the world for the production of cottonseed, coconuts,\r\npeanuts, and corn that it would have led all other countries in the\r\nutilization of vegetable oils for food. That this country has not so\r\nused its advantage is due to the fact that the new products have not\r\nmerely had to overcome popular conservatism, ignorance and\r\nprejudice--hard things to fight in any case--but have been deliberately\r\nchecked and hampered by the state and national governments in defense of\r\nvested interests. The farmer vote is a power that no politician likes to\r\ndefy and the dairy business in every state was thoroughly organized. In\r\nNew York the oleomargarin industry that in 1879 was turning out products\r\nvalued at more than $5,000,000 a year was completely crushed out by\r\nstate legislation.[2] The output of the United States, which in 1902 had\r\nrisen to 126,000,000 pounds, was cut down to 43,000,000 pounds in 1909\r\nby federal legislation. According to the disingenuous custom of American\r\nlawmakers the Act of 1902 was passed through Congress as a \"revenue\r\nmeasure,\" although it meant a loss to the Government of more than three\r\nmillion dollars a year over what might be produced by a straight two\r\ncents a pound tax. A wholesale dealer in oleomargarin was made to pay a\r\nhigher license than a wholesale liquor dealer. The federal law put a tax\r\nof ten cents a pound on yellow oleomargarin and a quarter of a cent a\r\npound on the uncolored. But people--doubtless from pure\r\nprejudice--prefer a yellow spread for their bread, so the economical\r\nhousewife has to work over her oleomargarin with the annatto which is\r\ngiven to her when she buys a package or, if the law prohibits this,\r\nwhich she is permitted to steal from an open box on the grocer's\r\ncounter. A plausible pretext for such legislation is afforded by the\r\nfact that the butter substitutes are so much like butter that they\r\ncannot be easily distinguished from it unless the use of annatto is\r\npermitted to butter and prohibited to its competitors. Fradulent sales\r\nof substitutes of any kind ought to be prevented, but the recent pure\r\nfood legislation in America has shown that it is possible to secure\r\ntruthful labeling without resorting to such drastic measures. In Europe\r\nthe laws against substitution were very strict, but not devised to\r\nrestrict the industry. Consequently the margarin output of Germany\r\ndoubled in the five years preceding the war and the output of England\r\ntripled. In Denmark the consumption of margarin rose from 8.8 pounds per\r\ncapita in 1890 to 32.6 pounds in 1912. Yet the butter business,\r\nDenmark's pride, was not injured, and Germany and England imported more\r\nbutter than ever before. Now that the price of butter in America has\r\ngone over the seventy-five cent mark Congress may conclude that it no\r\nlonger needs to be protected against competition.\r\n\r\nThe \"compound lards\" or \"lard compounds,\" consisting usually of\r\ncottonseed oil and oleo-stearin, although the latter may now be replaced\r\nby hardened oil, met with the same popular prejudice and attempted\r\nlegislative interference, but succeeded more easily in coming into\r\ncommon use under such names as \"Cottosuet,\" \"Kream Krisp,\" \"Kuxit,\"\r\n\"Korno,\" \"Cottolene\" and \"Crisco.\"\r\n\r\nOleomargarin, now generally abbreviated to margarin, originated, like\r\nmany other inventions, in military necessity. The French Government in\r\n1869 offered a prize for a butter substitute for the army that should be\r\ncheaper and better than butter in that it did not spoil so easily. The\r\nprize was won by a French chemist, Mége-Mouries, who found that by\r\nchilling beef fat the solid stearin could be separated from an oil\r\n(oleo) which was the substantially same as that in milk and hence in\r\nbutter. Neutral lard acts the same.\r\n\r\nThis discovery of how to separate the hard and soft fats was followed by\r\nimproved methods for purifying them and later by the process for\r\nconverting the soft into the hard fats by hydrogenation. The net result\r\nwas to put into the hands of the chemist the ability to draw his\r\nmaterials at will from any land and from the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms and to combine them as he will to make new fat foods for every\r\nuse; hard for summer, soft for winter; solid for the northerners and\r\nliquid for the southerners; white, yellow or any other color, and\r\nflavored to suit the taste. The Hindu can eat no fat from the sacred\r\ncow; the Mohammedan and the Jew can eat no fat from the abhorred pig;\r\nthe vegetarian will touch neither; other people will take both. No\r\nmatter, all can be accommodated.\r\n\r\nAll the fats and oils, though they consist of scores of different\r\ncompounds, have practically the same food value when freed from the\r\nextraneous matter that gives them their characteristic flavors. They are\r\nall practically tasteless and colorless. The various vegetable and\r\nanimal oils and fats have about the same digestibility, 98 per cent.,[3]\r\nand are all ordinarily completely utilized in the body, supplying it\r\nwith two and a quarter times as much energy as any other food.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that there is no difference in the\r\nproducts. The margarin men accuse butter of harboring tuberculosis germs\r\nfrom which their product, because it has been heated or is made from\r\nvegetable fats, is free. The butter men retort that margarin is lacking\r\nin vitamines, those mysterious substances which in minute amounts are\r\nnecessary for life and especially for growth. Both the claim and the\r\nobjection lose a large part of their force where the margarin, as is\r\ncustomarily the case, is mixed with butter or churned up with milk to\r\ngive it the familiar flavor. But the difficulty can be easily overcome.\r\nThe milk used for either butter or margarin should be free or freed from\r\ndisease germs. If margarin is altogether substituted for butter, the\r\nnecessary vitamines may be sufficiently provided by milk, eggs and\r\ngreens.\r\n\r\nOwing to these new processes all the fatty substances of all lands have\r\nbeen brought into competition with each other. In such a contest the\r\nvegetable is likely to beat the animal and the southern to win over the\r\nnorthern zones. In Europe before the war the proportion of the various\r\ningredients used to make butter substitutes was as follows:\r\n\r\n  AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF EUROPEAN MARGARIN\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Per Cent.\r\n  Animal hard fats              25\r\n  Vegetable hard fats           35\r\n    Copra                       29\r\n    Palm-kernel                  6\r\n  Vegetable soft fats           26\r\n    Cottonseed                  13\r\n    Peanut                       6\r\n    Sesame                       6\r\n    Soya-bean                    1\r\n  Water, milk, salt             14\r\n                               ___\r\n                               100\r\n\r\nThis is not the composition of any particular brand but the average of\r\nthem all. The use of a certain amount of the oil of the sesame seed is\r\nrequired by the laws of Germany and Denmark because it can be easily\r\ndetected by a chemical color test and so serves to prevent the margarin\r\ncontaining it from being sold as butter. \"Open sesame!\" is the password\r\nto these markets. Remembering that margarin originally was made up\r\nentirely of animal fats, soft and hard, we can see from the above\r\nfigures how rapidly they are being displaced by the vegetable fats. The\r\ncottonseed and peanut oils have replaced the original oleo oil and the\r\ntropical oils from the coconut (copra) and African palm are crowding out\r\nthe animal hard fats. Since now we can harden at will any of the\r\nvegetable oils it is possible to get along altogether without animal\r\nfats. Such vegetable margarins were originally prepared for sale in\r\nIndia, but proved unexpectedly popular in Europe, and are now being\r\nintroduced into America. They are sold under various trade names\r\nsuggesting their origin, such as \"palmira,\" \"palmona,\" \"milkonut,\"\r\n\"cocose,\" \"coconut oleomargarin\" and \"nucoa nut margarin.\" The last\r\nnamed is stated to be made of coconut oil (for the hard fat) and peanut\r\noil (for the soft fat), churned up with a culture of pasteurized milk\r\n(to impart the butter flavor). The law requires such a product to be\r\nbranded \"oleomargarine\" although it is not. Such cases of compulsory\r\nmislabeling are not rare. You remember the \"Pigs is Pigs\" story.\r\n\r\nPeanut butter has won its way into the American menu without any\r\ncamouflage whatever, and as a salad oil it is almost equally frank about\r\nits lowly origin. This nut, which grows on a vine instead of a tree,\r\nand is dug from the ground like potatoes instead of being picked with a\r\npole, goes by various names according to locality, peanuts, ground-nuts,\r\nmonkey-nuts, arachides and goobers. As it takes the place of cotton oil\r\nin some of its products so it takes its place in the fields and oilmills\r\nof Texas left vacant by the bollweevil. The once despised peanut added\r\nsome $56,000,000 to the wealth of the South in 1916. The peanut is rich\r\nin the richest of foods, some 50 per cent. of oil and 30 per cent. of\r\nprotein. The latter can be worked up into meat substitutes that will\r\nmake the vegetarian cease to envy his omnivorous neighbor. Thanks\r\nlargely to the chemist who has opened these new fields of usefulness,\r\nthe peanut-raiser got $1.25 a bushel in 1917 instead of the 30 cents\r\nthat he got four years before.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to enumerate all the available sources of\r\nvegetable oils, for all seeds and nuts contain more or less fatty matter\r\nand as we become more economical we shall utilize of what we now throw\r\naway. The germ of the corn kernel, once discarded in the manufacture of\r\nstarch, now yields a popular table oil. From tomato seeds, one of the\r\nwaste products of the canning factory, can be extracted 22 per cent. of\r\nan edible oil. Oats contain 7 per cent. of oil. From rape seed the\r\nJapanese get 20,000 tons of oil a year. To the sources previously\r\nmentioned may be added pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds, raspberry seeds,\r\ntobacco seeds, cockleburs, hazelnuts, walnuts, beechnuts and acorns.\r\n\r\nThe oil-bearing seeds of the tropics are innumerable and will become\r\nincreasingly essential to the inhabitants of northern lands. It was the\r\nrealization of this that brought on the struggle of the great powers\r\nfor the possession of tropical territory which, for years before, they\r\ndid not think worth while raising a flag over. No country in the future\r\ncan consider itself safe unless it has secure access to such sources. We\r\nhad a sharp lesson in this during the war. Palm oil, it seems, is\r\nnecessary for the manufacture of tinplate, an industry that was built up\r\nin the United States by the McKinley tariff. The British possessions in\r\nWest Africa were the chief source of palm oil and the Germans had the\r\nhandling of it. During the war the British Government assumed control of\r\nthe palm oil products of the British and German colonies and prohibited\r\ntheir export to other countries than England. Americans protested and\r\nbeseeched, but in vain. The British held, quite correctly, that they\r\nneeded all the oil they could get for food and lubrication and\r\nnitroglycerin. But the British also needed canned meat from America for\r\ntheir soldiers and when it was at length brought to their attention that\r\nthe packers could not ship meat unless they had cans and that cans could\r\nnot be made without tin and that tin could not be made without palm oil\r\nthe British Government consented to let us buy a little of their palm\r\noil. The lesson is that of Voltaire's story, \"Candide,\" \"Let us\r\ncultivate our own garden\"--and plant a few palm trees in it--also rubber\r\ntrees, but that is another story.\r\n\r\nThe international struggle for oil led to the partition of the Pacific\r\nas the struggle for rubber led to the partition of Africa. Theodor\r\nWeber, as Stevenson says, \"harried the Samoans\" to get copra much as\r\nKing Leopold of Belgium harried the Congoese to get caoutchouc. It was\r\nWeber who first fully realized that the South Sea islands, formerly\r\ngiven over to cannibals, pirates and missionaries, might be made\r\nimmensely valuable through the cultivation of the coconut palms. When\r\nthe ripe coconut is split open and exposed to the sun the meat dries up\r\nand shrivels and in this form, called \"copra,\" it can be cut out and\r\nshipped to the factory where the oil is extracted and refined. Weber\r\nwhile German Consul in Samoa was also manager of what was locally known\r\nas \"the long-handled concern\" (_Deutsche Handels und Plantagen\r\nGesellschaft der Südsee Inseln zu Hamburg_), a pioneer commercial and\r\nsemi-official corporation that played a part in the Pacific somewhat\r\nlike the British Hudson Bay Company in Canada or East India Company in\r\nHindustan. Through the agency of this corporation on the start Germany\r\nacquired a virtual monopoly of the transportation and refining of\r\ncoconut oil and would have become the dominant power in the Pacific if\r\nshe had not been checked by force of arms. In Apia Bay in 1889 and again\r\nin Manila Bay in 1898 an American fleet faced a German fleet ready for\r\naction while a British warship lay between. So we rescued the\r\nPhilippines and Samoa from German rule and in 1914 German power was\r\neliminated from the Pacific. During the ten years before the war, the\r\nproduction of copra in the German islands more than doubled and this was\r\nonly the beginning of the business. Now these islands have been divided\r\nup among Australia, New Zealand and Japan, and these countries are\r\nplanning to take care of the copra.\r\n\r\nBut although we get no extension of territory from the war we still\r\nhave the Philippines and some of the Samoan Islands, and these are\r\ncapable of great development. From her share of the Samoan Islands\r\nGermany got a million dollars' worth of copra and we might get more from\r\nours. The Philippines now lead the world in the production of copra, but\r\nJava is a close second and Ceylon not far behind. If we do not look out\r\nwe will be beaten both by the Dutch and the British, for they are\r\nundertaking the cultivation of the coconut on a larger scale and in a\r\nmore systematic way. According to an official bulletin of the Philippine\r\nGovernment a coconut plantation should bring in \"dividends ranging from\r\n10 to 75 per cent. from the tenth to the hundredth year.\" And this being\r\nprinted in 1913 figured the price of copra at 3-1/2 cents, whereas it\r\nbrought 4-1/2 cents in 1918, so the prospect is still more encouraging.\r\nThe copra is half fat and can be cheaply shipped to America, where it\r\ncan be crushed in the southern oilmills when they are not busy on\r\ncottonseed or peanuts. But even this cost of transportation can be\r\nreduced by extracting the oil in the islands and shipping it in bulk\r\nlike petroleum in tank steamers.\r\n\r\nIn the year ending June, 1918, the United States imported from the\r\nPhilippines 155,000,000 pounds of coconut oil worth $18,000,000 and\r\n220,000,000 pounds of copra worth $10,000,000. But this was about half\r\nour total importations; the rest of it we had to get from foreign\r\ncountries. Panama palms may give us a little relief from this dependence\r\non foreign sources. In 1917 we imported 19,000,000 whole coconuts from\r\nPanama valued at $700,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPLITTING COCONUTS ON THE ISLAND OF TAHITI\r\n\r\nAfter drying in the sun the meat is picked and the oil extracted for\r\nmaking coconut butter]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"America's Munitions\"\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC CURRENT PASSING THROUGH SALT WATER IN THESE CELLS\r\nDECOMPOSES THE SALT INTO CAUSTIC SODA AND CHLORINE GAS\r\n\r\nThere were eight rooms like this in the Edgewood plant, capable of\r\nproducing 200,000 pounds of chlorine a day]\r\n\r\nA new form of fat that has rapidly come into our market is the oil of\r\nthe soya or soy bean. In 1918 we imported over 300,000,000 pounds of\r\nsoy-bean oil, mostly from Manchuria. The oil is used in manufacture of\r\nsubstitutes for butter, lard, cheese, milk and cream, as well as for\r\nsoap and paint. The soy-bean can be raised in the United States wherever\r\ncorn can be grown and provides provender for man and beast. The soy meal\r\nleft after the extraction of the oil makes a good cattle food and the\r\nfermented juice affords the shoya sauce made familiar to us through the\r\npopularity of the chop-suey restaurants.\r\n\r\nAs meat and dairy products become scarcer and dearer we shall become\r\nincreasingly dependent upon the vegetable fats. We should therefore\r\ndevise means of saving what we now throw away, raise as much as we can\r\nunder our own flag, keep open avenues for our foreign supply and\r\nencourage our cooks to make use of the new products invented by our\r\nchemists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFIGHTING WITH FUMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Germans opened the war using projectiles seventeen inches in\r\ndiameter. They closed it using projectiles one one-hundred millionth of\r\nan inch in diameter. And the latter were more effective than the former.\r\nAs the dimensions were reduced from molar to molecular the battle became\r\nmore intense. For when the Big Bertha had shot its bolt, that was the\r\nend of it. Whomever it hit was hurt, but after that the steel fragments\r\nof the shell lay on the ground harmless and inert. The men in the\r\ndugouts could hear the shells whistle overhead without alarm. But the\r\npoison gas could penetrate where the rifle ball could not. The malignant\r\nmolecules seemed to search out their victims. They crept through the\r\ncrevices of the subterranean shelters. They hunted for the pinholes in\r\nthe face masks. They lay in wait for days in the trenches for the\r\nsoldiers' return as a cat watches at the hole of a mouse. The cannon\r\nball could be seen and heard. The poison gas was invisible and\r\ninaudible, and sometimes even the chemical sense which nature has given\r\nman for his protection, the sense of smell, failed to give warning of\r\nthe approach of the foe.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the matter that man can deal with the more he can get out of\r\nit. So long as man was dependent for power upon wind and water his\r\nworking capacity was very limited. But as soon as he passed over the\r\nborder line from physics into chemistry and learned how to use the\r\nmolecule, his efficiency in work and warfare was multiplied manifold.\r\nThe molecular bombardment of the piston by steam or the gases of\r\ncombustion runs his engines and propels his cars. The first man who\r\nwanted to kill another from a safe distance threw the stone by his arm's\r\nstrength. David added to his arm the centrifugal force of a sling when\r\nhe slew Goliath. The Romans improved on this by concentrating in a\r\ncatapult the strength of a score of slaves and casting stone cannon\r\nballs to the top of the city wall. But finally man got closer to\r\nnature's secret and discovered that by loosing a swarm of gaseous\r\nmolecules he could throw his projectile seventy-five miles and then by\r\nthe same force burst it into flying fragments. There is no smaller\r\nprojectile than the atom unless our belligerent chemists can find a way\r\nof using the electron stream of the cathode ray. But this so far has\r\nfigured only in the pages of our scientific romancers and has not yet\r\nappeared on the battlefield. If, however, man could tap the reservoir of\r\nsub-atomic energy he need do no more work and would make no more war,\r\nfor unlimited powers of construction and destruction would be at his\r\ncommand. The forces of the infinitesimal are infinite.\r\n\r\nThe reason why a gas is so active is because it is so egoistic.\r\nPsychologically interpreted, a gas consists of particles having the\r\nutmost aversion to one another. Each tries to get as far away from every\r\nother as it can. There is no cohesive force; no attractive impulse;\r\nnothing to draw them together except the all too feeble power of\r\ngravitation. The hotter they get the more they try to disperse and so\r\nthe gas expands. The gas represents the extreme of individualism as\r\nsteel represents the extreme of collectivism. The combination of the two\r\nworks wonders. A hot gas in a steel cylinder is the most powerful agency\r\nknown to man, and by means of it he accomplishes his greatest\r\nachievements in peace or war time.\r\n\r\nThe projectile is thrown from the gun by the expansive force of the\r\ngases released from the powder and when it reaches its destination it is\r\nblown to pieces by the same force. This is the end of it if it is a\r\nshell of the old-fashioned sort, for the gases of combustion mingle\r\nharmlessly with the air of which they are normal constituents. But if it\r\nis a poison gas shell each molecule as it is released goes off straight\r\ninto the air with a speed twice that of the cannon ball and carries\r\ndeath with it. A man may be hit by a heavy piece of lead or iron and\r\nstill survive, but an unweighable amount of lethal gas may be fatal to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMost of the novelties of the war were merely extensions of what was\r\nalready known. To increase the caliber of a cannon from 38 to 42\r\ncentimeters or its range from 30 to 75 miles does indeed make necessary\r\na decided change in tactics, but it is not comparable to the revolution\r\neffected by the introduction of new weapons of unprecedented power such\r\nas airplanes, submarines, tanks, high explosives or poison gas. If any\r\narmy had been as well equipped with these in the beginning as all armies\r\nwere at the end it might easily have won the war. That is to say, if the\r\ngeneral staff of any of the powers had had the foresight and confidence\r\nto develop and practise these modes of warfare on a large scale in\r\nadvance it would have been irresistible against an enemy unprepared to\r\nmeet them. But no military genius appeared on either side with\r\nsufficient courage and imagination to work out such schemes in secret\r\nbefore trying them out on a small scale in the open. Consequently the\r\nenemy had fair warning and ample time to learn how to meet them and\r\nmethods of defense developed concurrently with methods of attack. For\r\ninstance, consider the motor fortresses to which Ludendorff ascribes his\r\ndefeat. The British first sent out a few clumsy tanks against the German\r\nlines. Then they set about making a lot of stronger and livelier ones,\r\nbut by the time these were ready the Germans had field guns to smash\r\nthem and chain fences with concrete posts to stop them. On the other\r\nhand, if the Germans had followed up their advantage when they first set\r\nthe cloud of chlorine floating over the battlefield of Ypres they might\r\nhave won the war in the spring of 1915 instead of losing it in the fall\r\nof 1918. For the British were unprepared and unprotected against the\r\nsilent death that swept down upon them on the 22nd of April, 1915. What\r\nhappened then is best told by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his \"History of\r\nthe Great War.\"\r\n\r\n     From the base of the German trenches over a considerable length\r\n     there appeared jets of whitish vapor, which gathered and\r\n     swirled until they settled into a definite low cloud-bank,\r\n     greenish-brown below and yellow above, where it reflected the\r\n     rays of the sinking sun. This ominous bank of vapor, impelled\r\n     by a northern breeze, drifted swiftly across the space which\r\n     separated the two lines. The French troops, staring over the\r\n     top of their parapet at this curious screen which ensured them\r\n     a temporary relief from fire, were observed suddenly to throw\r\n     up their hands, to clutch at their throats, and to fall to the\r\n     ground in the agonies of asphyxiation. Many lay where they had\r\n     fallen, while their comrades, absolutely helpless against this\r\n     diabolical agency, rushed madly out of the mephitic mist and\r\n     made for the rear, over-running the lines of trenches behind\r\n     them. Many of them never halted until they had reached Ypres,\r\n     while others rushed westwards and put the canal between\r\n     themselves and the enemy. The Germans, meanwhile, advanced, and\r\n     took possession of the successive lines of trenches, tenanted\r\n     only by the dead garrisons, whose blackened faces, contorted\r\n     figures, and lips fringed with the blood and foam from their\r\n     bursting lungs, showed the agonies in which they had died. Some\r\n     thousands of stupefied prisoners, eight batteries of French\r\n     field-guns, and four British 4.7's, which had been placed in a\r\n     wood behind the French position, were the trophies won by this\r\n     disgraceful victory.\r\n\r\n     Under the shattering blow which they had received, a blow\r\n     particularly demoralizing to African troops, with their fears\r\n     of magic and the unknown, it was impossible to rally them\r\n     effectually until the next day. It is to be remembered in\r\n     explanation of this disorganization that it was the first\r\n     experience of these poison tactics, and that the troops engaged\r\n     received the gas in a very much more severe form than our own\r\n     men on the right of Langemarck. For a time there was a gap five\r\n     miles broad in the front of the position of the Allies, and\r\n     there were many hours during which there was no substantial\r\n     force between the Germans and Ypres. They wasted their time,\r\n     however, in consolidating their ground, and the chance of a\r\n     great coup passed forever. They had sold their souls as\r\n     soldiers, but the Devil's price was a poor one. Had they had a\r\n     corps of cavalry ready, and pushed them through the gap, it\r\n     would have been the most dangerous moment of the war.\r\n\r\nA deserter had come over from the German side a week before and told\r\nthem that cylinders of poison gas had been laid in the front trenches,\r\nbut no one believed him or paid any attention to his tale. War was then,\r\nin the Englishman's opinion, a gentleman's game, the royal sport, and\r\npoison was prohibited by the Hague rules. But the Germans were not\r\nplaying the game according to the rules, so the British soldiers were\r\nstrangled in their own trenches and fell easy victims to the advancing\r\nfoe. Within half an hour after the gas was turned on 80 per cent. of the\r\nopposing troops were knocked out. The Canadians, with wet handkerchiefs\r\nover their faces, closed in to stop the gap, but if the Germans had been\r\nprepared for such success they could have cleared the way to the coast.\r\nBut after such trials the Germans stopped the use of free chlorine and\r\nbegan the preparation of more poisonous gases. In some way that may not\r\nbe revealed till the secret history of the war is published, the British\r\nIntelligence Department obtained a copy of the lecture notes of the\r\ninstructions to the German staff giving details of the new system of gas\r\nwarfare to be started in December. Among the compounds named was\r\nphosgene, a gas so lethal that one part in ten thousand of air may be\r\nfatal. The antidote for it is hexamethylene tetramine. This is not\r\nsomething the soldier--or anybody else--is accustomed to carry around\r\nwith him, but the British having had a chance to cram up in advance on\r\nthe stolen lecture notes were ready with gas helmets soaked in the\r\nreagent with the long name.\r\n\r\nThe Germans rejoiced when gas bombs took the place of bayonets because\r\nthis was a field in which intelligence counted for more than brute\r\nforce and in which therefore they expected to be supreme. As usual they\r\nwere right in their major premise but wrong in their conclusion, owing\r\nto the egoism of their implicit minor premise. It does indeed give the\r\nadvantage to skill and science, but the Germans were beaten at their own\r\ngame, for by the end of the war the United States was able to turn out\r\ntoxic gases at a rate of 200 tons a day, while the output of Germany or\r\nEngland was only about 30 tons. A gas plant was started at Edgewood,\r\nMaryland, in November, 1917. By March it was filling shell and before\r\nthe war put a stop to its activities in the fall it was producing\r\n1,300,000 pounds of chlorine, 1,000,000 pounds of chlorpicrin, 1,300,000\r\npounds of phosgene and 700,000 pounds of mustard gas a month.\r\n\r\nChlorine, the first gas used, is unpleasantly familiar to every one who\r\nhas entered a chemical laboratory or who has smelled the breath of\r\nbleaching powder. It is a greenish-yellow gas made from common salt. The\r\nGermans employed it at Ypres by laying cylinders of the liquefied gas in\r\nthe trenches, about a yard apart, and running a lead discharge pipe over\r\nthe parapet. When the stop cocks are turned the gas streams out and\r\nsince it is two and a half times as heavy as air it rolls over the\r\nground like a noisome mist. It works best when the ground slopes gently\r\ndown toward the enemy and when the wind blows in that direction at a\r\nrate between four and twelve miles an hour. But the wind, being strictly\r\nneutral, may change its direction without warning and then the gases\r\nturn back in their flight and attack their own side, something that\r\nrifle bullets have never been known to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © International Film Service\r\n\r\nGERMANS STARTING A GAS ATTACK ON THE RUSSIAN LINES\r\n\r\nBehind the cylinders from which the gas streams are seen three lines of\r\nGerman troops waiting to attack. The photograph was taken from above by\r\na Russian airman]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © Press Illustrating Service\r\n\r\nFILLING THE CANNISTERS OF GAS MASKS WITH CHARCOAL MADE FROM FRUIT PITS\r\nIN LONG ISLAND CITY]\r\n\r\nBecause free chlorine would not stay put and was dependent on the favor\r\nof the wind for its effect, it was later employed, not as an elemental\r\ngas, but in some volatile liquid that could be fired in a shell and so\r\nreleased at any particular point far back of the front trenches.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used of these compounds was phosgene, which, as the\r\nreader can see by inspection of its formula, COCl_{2}, consists of\r\nchlorine (Cl) combined with carbon monoxide (CO), the cause of deaths\r\nfrom illuminating gas. These two poisonous gases, chlorine and carbon\r\nmonoxide, when mixed together, will not readily unite, but if a ray of\r\nsunlight falls upon the mixture they combine at once. For this reason\r\nJohn Davy, who discovered the compound over a hundred years ago, named\r\nit phosgene, that is, \"produced by light.\" The same roots recur in\r\nhydrogen, so named because it is \"produced from water,\" and phosphorus,\r\nbecause it is a \"light-bearer.\"\r\n\r\nIn its modern manufacture the catalyzer or instigator of the combination\r\nis not sunlight but porous carbon. This is packed in iron boxes eight\r\nfeet long, through which the mixture of the two gases was forced. Carbon\r\nmonoxide may be made by burning coke with a supply of air insufficient\r\nfor complete combustion, but in order to get the pure gas necessary for\r\nthe phosgene common air was not used, but instead pure oxygen extracted\r\nfrom it by a liquid air plant.\r\n\r\nPhosgene is a gas that may be condensed easily to a liquid by cooling it\r\ndown to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. A mixture of three-quarters chlorine with\r\none-quarter phosgene has been found most effective. By itself phosgene\r\nhas an inoffensive odor somewhat like green corn and so may fail to\r\narouse apprehension until a toxic concentration is reached. But even\r\nsmall doses have such an effect upon the heart action for days afterward\r\nthat a slight exertion may prove fatal.\r\n\r\nThe compound manufactured in largest amount in America was chlorpicrin.\r\nThis, like the others, is not so unfamiliar as it seems. As may be seen\r\nfrom its formula, CCl_{3}NO_{2}, it is formed by joining the nitric acid\r\nradical (NO_{2}), found in all explosives, with the main part of\r\nchloroform (HCCl_{3}). This is not quite so poisonous as phosgene, but\r\nit has the advantage that it causes nausea and vomiting. The soldier so\r\naffected is forced to take off his gas mask and then may fall victim to\r\nmore toxic gases sent over simultaneously.\r\n\r\nChlorpicrin is a liquid and is commonly loaded in a shell or bomb with\r\n20 per cent. of tin chloride, which produces dense white fumes that go\r\nthrough gas masks. It is made from picric acid (trinitrophenol), one of\r\nthe best known of the high explosives, by treatment with chlorine. The\r\nchlorine is obtained, as it is in the household, from common bleaching\r\npowder, or \"chloride of lime.\" This is mixed with water to form a cream\r\nin a steel still 18 feet high and 8 feet in diameter. A solution of\r\ncalcium picrate, that is, the lime salt of picric acid, is pumped in and\r\nas the reaction begins the mixture heats up and the chlorpicrin distils\r\nover with the steam. When the distillate is condensed the chlorpicrin,\r\nbeing the heavier liquid, settles out under the layer of water and may\r\nbe drawn off to fill the shell.\r\n\r\nMuch of what a student learns in the chemical laboratory he is apt to\r\nforget in later life if he does not follow it up. But there are two\r\ngases that he always remembers, chlorine and hydrogen sulfide. He is\r\nlucky if he has escaped being choked by the former or sickened by the\r\nlatter. He can imagine what the effect would be if two offensive fumes\r\ncould be combined without losing their offensive features. Now a\r\ncombination something like this is the so-called mustard gas, which is\r\nnot a gas and is not made from mustard. But it is easily gasified, and\r\noil of mustard is about as near as Nature dare come to making such\r\nsinful stuff. It was first made by Guthrie, an Englishman, in 1860, and\r\nrediscovered by a German chemist, Victor Meyer, in 1886, but he found it\r\nso dangerous to work with that he abandoned the investigation. Nobody\r\nelse cared to take it up, for nobody could see any use for it. So it\r\nremained in innocuous desuetude, a mere name in \"Beilstein's\r\nDictionary,\" together with the thousands of other organic compounds that\r\nhave been invented and never utilized. But on July 12, 1917, the British\r\nholding the line at Ypres were besprinkled with this villainous\r\nsubstance. Its success was so great that the Germans henceforth made it\r\ntheir main reliance and soon the Allies followed suit. In one offensive\r\nof ten days the Germans are said to have used a million shells\r\ncontaining 2500 tons of mustard gas.\r\n\r\nThe making of so dangerous a compound on a large scale was one of the\r\nmost difficult tasks set before the chemists of this and other\r\ncountries, yet it was successfully solved. The raw materials are\r\nchlorine, alcohol and sulfur. The alcohol is passed with steam through\r\na vertical iron tube filled with kaolin and heated. This converts the\r\nalcohol into a gas known as ethylene (C_{2}H_{4}). Passing a stream of\r\nchlorine gas into a tank of melted sulfur produces sulfur monochloride\r\nand this treated with the ethylene makes the \"mustard.\" The final\r\nreaction was carried on at the Edgewood Arsenal in seven airtight tanks\r\nor \"reactors,\" each having a capacity of 30,000 pounds. The ethylene gas\r\nbeing led into the tank and distributed through the liquid sulfur\r\nchloride by porous blocks or fine nozzles, the two chemicals combined to\r\nform what is officially named \"di-chlor-di-ethyl-sulfide\"\r\n(ClC_{2}H_{4}SC_{2}H_{4}Cl). This, however, is too big a mouthful, so\r\neven the chemists were glad to fall in with the commonalty and call it\r\n\"mustard gas.\"\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of \"mustard\" depends upon its persistence. It is a\r\nstable liquid, evaporating slowly and not easily decomposed. It lingers\r\nabout trenches and dugouts and impregnates soil and cloth for days. Gas\r\nmasks do not afford complete protection, for even if they are\r\nimpenetrable they must be taken off some time and the gas lies in wait\r\nfor that time. In some cases the masks were worn continuously for twelve\r\nhours after the attack, but when they were removed the soldiers were\r\noverpowered by the poison. A place may seem to be free from it but when\r\nthe sun heats up the ground the liquid volatilizes and the vapor soaks\r\nthrough the clothing. As the men become warmed up by work their skin is\r\nblistered, especially under the armpits. The mustard acts like steam,\r\nproducing burns that range from a mere reddening to serious\r\nulcerations, always painful and incapacitating, but if treated promptly\r\nin the hospital rarely causing death or permanent scars. The gas attacks\r\nthe eyes, throat, nose and lungs and may lead to bronchitis or\r\npneumonia. It was found necessary at the front to put all the clothing\r\nof the soldiers into the sterilizing ovens every night to remove all\r\ntraces of mustard. General Johnson and his staff in the 77th Division\r\nwere poisoned in their dugouts because they tried to alleviate the\r\ndiscomfort of their camp cots by bedding taken from a neighboring\r\nvillage that had been shelled the day before.\r\n\r\nOf the 925 cases requiring medical attention at the Edgewood Arsenal 674\r\nwere due to mustard. During the month of August 3-1/2 per cent. of the\r\nmustard plant force were sent to the hospital each day on the average.\r\nBut the record of the Edgewood Arsenal is a striking demonstration of\r\nwhat can be done in the prevention of industrial accidents by the\r\nexercise of scientific prudence. In spite of the fact that from three to\r\neleven thousand men were employed at the plant for the year 1918 and\r\nturned out some twenty thousand tons of the most poisonous gases known\r\nto man, there were only three fatalities and not a single case of\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\nBesides the four toxic gases previously described, chlorine, phosgene,\r\nchlorpicrin and mustard, various other compounds have been and many\r\nothers might be made. A list of those employed in the present war\r\nenumerates thirty, among them compounds of bromine, arsenic and cyanogen\r\nthat may prove more formidable than any so far used. American chemists\r\nkept very mum during the war but occasionally one could not refrain\r\nfrom saying: \"If the Kaiser knew what I know he would surrender\r\nunconditionally by telegraph.\" No doubt the science of chemical warfare\r\nis in its infancy and every foresighted power has concealed weapons of\r\nits own in reserve. One deadly compound, whose identity has not yet been\r\ndisclosed, is known as \"Lewisite,\" from Professor Lewis of Northwestern,\r\nwho was manufacturing it at the rate of ten tons a day in the \"Mouse\r\nTrap\" stockade near Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of warfare the art of defense has kept pace with\r\nthe art of offense and the courage of man has never failed, no matter to\r\nwhat new danger he was exposed. As each new gas employed by the enemy\r\nwas detected it became the business of our chemists to discover some\r\nmethod of absorbing or neutralizing it. Porous charcoal, best made from\r\nsuch dense wood as coconut shells, was packed in the respirator box\r\ntogether with layers of such chemicals as will catch the gases to be\r\nexpected. Charcoal absorbs large quantities of any gas. Soda lime and\r\npotassium permanganate and nickel salts were among the neutralizers\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe mask is fitted tightly about the face or over the head with rubber.\r\nThe nostrils are kept closed with a clip so breathing must be done\r\nthrough the mouth and no air can be inhaled except that passing through\r\nthe absorbent cylinder. Men within five miles of the front were required\r\nto wear the masks slung on their chests so they could be put on within\r\nsix seconds. A well-made mask with a fresh box afforded almost complete\r\nimmunity for a time and the soldiers learned within a few days to\r\nhandle their masks adroitly. So the problem of defense against this new\r\noffensive was solved satisfactorily, while no such adequate protection\r\nagainst the older weapons of bayonet and shrapnel has yet been devised.\r\n\r\nThen the problem of the offense was to catch the opponent with his\r\nmask off or to make him take it off. Here the lachrymators and\r\nthe sternutators, the tear gases and the sneeze gases, came into\r\nplay. Phenylcarbylamine chloride would make the bravest soldier\r\nweep on the battlefield with the abandonment of a Greek hero.\r\nDi-phenyl-chloro-arsine would set him sneezing. The Germans alternated\r\nthese with diabolical ingenuity so as to catch us unawares. Some shells\r\ngave off voluminous smoke or a vile stench without doing much harm, but\r\nby the time our men got used to these and grew careless about their\r\nmasks a few shells of some extremely poisonous gas were mixed with them.\r\n\r\nThe ideal gas for belligerent purposes would be odorless, colorless and\r\ninvisible, toxic even when diluted by a million parts of air, not set on\r\nfire or exploded by the detonator of the shell, not decomposed by water,\r\nnot readily absorbed, stable enough to stand storage for six months and\r\ncapable of being manufactured by the thousands of tons. No one gas will\r\nserve all aims. For instance, phosgene being very volatile and quickly\r\ndissipated is thrown into trenches that are soon to be taken while\r\nmustard gas being very tenacious could not be employed in such a case\r\nfor the trenches could not be occupied if they were captured.\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of poison gas in warfare by all the belligerents is a\r\nvindication of the American protest at the Hague Conference against its\r\nprohibition. At the First Conference of 1899 Captain Mahan argued very\r\nsensibly that gas shells were no worse than other projectiles and might\r\nindeed prove more merciful and that it was illogical to prohibit a\r\nweapon merely because of its novelty. The British delegates voted with\r\nthe Americans in opposition to the clause \"the contracting parties agree\r\nto abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the\r\ndiffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases.\" But both Great Britain\r\nand Germany later agreed to the provision. The use of poison gas by\r\nGermany without warning was therefore an act of treachery and a\r\nviolation of her pledge, but the United States has consistently refused\r\nto bind herself to any such restriction. The facts reported by General\r\nAmos A. Fries, in command of the overseas branch of the American\r\nChemical Warfare Service, give ample support to the American contention\r\nat The Hague:\r\n\r\n     Out of 1000 gas casualties there are from 30 to 40 fatalities,\r\n     while out of 1000 high explosive casualties the number of\r\n     fatalities run from 200 to 250. While exact figures are as yet\r\n     not available concerning the men permanently crippled or\r\n     blinded by high explosives one has only to witness the\r\n     debarkation of a shipload of troops to be convinced that the\r\n     number is very large. On the other hand there is, so far as\r\n     known at present, not a single case of permanent disability or\r\n     blindness among our troops due to gas and this in face of the\r\n     fact that the Germans used relatively large quantities of this\r\n     material.\r\n\r\n     In the light of these facts the prejudice against the use of\r\n     gas must gradually give way; for the statement made to the\r\n     effect that its use is contrary to the principles of humanity\r\n     will apply with far greater force to the use of high\r\n     explosives. As a matter of fact, for certain purposes toxic gas\r\n     is an ideal agent. For example, it is difficult to imagine any\r\n     agent more effective or more humane that may be used to render\r\n     an opposing battery ineffective or to protect retreating\r\n     troops.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mahan's argument at The Hague against the proposed prohibition\r\nof poison gas is so cogent and well expressed that it has been quoted in\r\ntreatises on international law ever since. These reasons were, briefly:\r\n\r\n     1. That no shell emitting such gases is as yet in practical use\r\n     or has undergone adequate experiment; consequently, a vote\r\n     taken now would be taken in ignorance of the facts as to\r\n     whether the results would be of a decisive character or whether\r\n     injury in excess of that necessary to attain the end of\r\n     warfare--the immediate disabling of the enemy--would be\r\n     inflicted.\r\n\r\n     2. That the reproach of cruelty and perfidy, addressed against\r\n     these supposed shells, was equally uttered formerly against\r\n     firearms and torpedoes, both of which are now employed without\r\n     scruple. Until we know the effects of such asphyxiating shells,\r\n     there was no saying whether they would be more or less merciful\r\n     than missiles now permitted. That it was illogical, and not\r\n     demonstrably humane, to be tender about asphyxiating men with\r\n     gas, when all are prepared to admit that it was allowable to\r\n     blow the bottom out of an ironclad at midnight, throwing four\r\n     or five hundred into the sea, to be choked by water, with\r\n     scarcely the remotest chance of escape.\r\n\r\nAs Captain Mahan says, the same objection has been raised at the\r\nintroduction of each new weapon of war, even though it proved to be no\r\nmore cruel than the old. The modern rifle ball, swift and small and\r\nsterilized by heat, does not make so bad a wound as the ancient sword\r\nand spear, but we all remember how gunpowder was regarded by the dandies\r\nof Hotspur's time:\r\n\r\n  And it was great pity, so it was,\r\n  This villainous saltpeter should be digg'd\r\n  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth\r\n  Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd\r\n  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns\r\n  He would himself have been a soldier.\r\n\r\nThe real reason for the instinctive aversion manifested against any new\r\narm or mode of attack is that it reveals to us the intrinsic horror of\r\nwar. We naturally revolt against premeditated homicide, but we have\r\nbecome so accustomed to the sword and latterly to the rifle that they do\r\nnot shock us as they ought when we think of what they are made for. The\r\nConstitution of the United States prohibits the infliction of \"cruel and\r\nunusual punishments.\" The two adjectives were apparently used almost\r\nsynonymously, as though any \"unusual\" punishment were necessarily\r\n\"cruel,\" and so indeed it strikes us. But our ingenious lawyers were\r\nable to persuade the courts that electrocution, though unknown to the\r\nFathers and undeniably \"unusual,\" was not unconstitutional. Dumdum\r\nbullets are rightfully ruled out because they inflict frightful and\r\noften incurable wounds, and the aim of humane warfare is to disable the\r\nenemy, not permanently to injure him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"America's Munitions\" THE CHLORPICRIN PLANT AT THE\r\nEDGEWOOD ARSENAL\r\n\r\nFrom these stills, filled with a mixture of bleaching powder, lime, and\r\npicric acid, the poisonous gas, chlorpicrin, distills off.

This is a\r\nstrange omission considering that the French and British defended their\r\nuse of explosives which diffuse asphyxiating and deleterious gases on\r\nthe ground that this was not the \"sole\" purpose of the bombs but merely\r\nan accidental effect of the nitric powder used.\r\n\r\nThe Hague Congress of 1907 placed in its rules for war: \"It is expressly\r\nforbidden to employ poisons or poisonous weapons.\" But such attempts to\r\nrule out new and more effective means of warfare are likely to prove\r\nfutile in any serious conflict and the restriction gives the advantage\r\nto the most unscrupulous side. We Americans, if ever we give our assent\r\nto such an agreement, would of course keep it, but our enemy--whoever he\r\nmay be in the future--will be, as he always has been, utterly without\r\nprinciple and will not hesitate to employ any weapon against us.\r\nBesides, as the Germans held, chemical warfare favors the army that is\r\nmost intelligent, resourceful and disciplined and the nation that stands\r\nhighest in science and industry. This advantage, let us hope, will be on\r\nour side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPRODUCTS OF THE ELECTRIC FURNACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe control of man over the materials of nature has been vastly enhanced\r\nby the recent extension of the range of temperature at his command. When\r\nFahrenheit stuck the bulb of his thermometer into a mixture of snow and\r\nsalt he thought he had reached the nadir of temperature, so he scratched\r\na mark on the tube where the mercury stood and called it zero. But we\r\nknow that absolute zero, the total absence of heat, is 459 of\r\nFahrenheit's degrees lower than his zero point. The modern scientist can\r\nget close to that lowest limit by making use of the cooling by the\r\nexpansion principle. He first liquefies air under pressure and then\r\nreleasing the pressure allows it to boil off. A tube of hydrogen\r\nimmersed in the liquid air as it evaporates is cooled down until it can\r\nbe liquefied. Then the boiling hydrogen is used to liquefy helium, and\r\nas this boils off it lowers the temperature to within three or four\r\ndegrees of absolute zero.\r\n\r\nThe early metallurgist had no hotter a fire than he could make by\r\nblowing charcoal with a bellows. This was barely enough for the smelting\r\nof iron. But by the bringing of two carbon rods together, as in the\r\nelectric arc light, we can get enough heat to volatilize the carbon at\r\nthe tips, and this means over 7000 degrees Fahrenheit. By putting a\r\npressure of twenty atmospheres onto the arc light we can raise it to\r\nperhaps 14,000 degrees, which is 3000 degrees hotter than the sun. This\r\ngives the modern man a working range of about 14,500 degrees, so it is\r\nno wonder that he can perform miracles.\r\n\r\nWhen a builder wants to make an old house over into a new one he takes\r\nit apart brick by brick and stone by stone, then he puts them together\r\nin such new fashion as he likes. The electric furnace enables the\r\nchemist to take his materials apart in the same way. As the temperature\r\nrises the chemical and physical forces that hold a body together\r\ngradually weaken. First the solid loosens up and becomes a liquid, then\r\nthis breaks bonds and becomes a gas. Compounds break up into their\r\nelements. The elemental molecules break up into their component atoms\r\nand finally these begin to throw off corpuscles of negative electricity\r\neighteen hundred times smaller than the smallest atom. These electrons\r\nappear to be the building stones of the universe. No indication of any\r\nsmaller units has been discovered, although we need not assume that in\r\nthe electron science has delivered, what has been called, its\r\n\"ultim-atom.\" The Greeks called the elemental particles of matter\r\n\"atoms\" because they esteemed them \"indivisible,\" but now in the light\r\nof the X-ray we can witness the disintegration of the atom into\r\nelectrons. All the chemical and physical properties of matter, except\r\nperhaps weight, seem to depend upon the number and movement of the\r\nnegative and positive electrons and by their rearrangement one element\r\nmay be transformed into another.\r\n\r\nSo the electric furnace, where the highest attainable temperature is\r\ncombined with the divisive and directive force of the current, is a\r\nmagical machine for accomplishment of the metamorphoses desired by the\r\ncreative chemist. A hundred years ago Davy, by dipping the poles of his\r\nbattery into melted soda lye, saw forming on one of them a shining\r\nglobule like quicksilver. It was the metal sodium, never before seen by\r\nman. Nowadays this process of electrolysis (electric loosening) is\r\ncarried out daily by the ton at Niagara.\r\n\r\nThe reverse process, electro-synthesis (electric combining), is equally\r\nsimple and even more important. By passing a strong electric current\r\nthrough a mixture of lime and coke the metal calcium disengages itself\r\nfrom the oxygen of the lime and attaches itself to the carbon. Or, to\r\nput it briefly,\r\n\r\n  CaO  +  3C   -->   CaC_{2} + CO\r\n  lime   coke       calcium    carbon\r\n                      carbide    monoxide\r\n\r\nThis reaction is of peculiar importance because it bridges the gulf\r\nbetween the organic and inorganic worlds. It was formerly supposed that\r\nthe substances found in plants and animals, mostly complex compounds of\r\ncarbon, hydrogen and oxygen, could only be produced by \"vital forces.\"\r\nIf this were true it meant that chemistry was limited to the mineral\r\nkingdom and to the extraction of such carbon compounds as happened to\r\nexist ready formed in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. But fortunately\r\nthis barrier to human achievement proved purely illusory. The organic\r\nfield, once man had broken into it, proved easier to work in than the\r\ninorganic.\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed that man is dreadfully clumsy about it yet. He\r\ntakes a thousand horsepower engine and an electric furnace at several\r\nthousand degrees to get carbon into combination with hydrogen while the\r\nlittle green leaf in the sunshine does it quietly without getting hot\r\nabout it. Evidently man is working as wastefully as when he used a\r\nthousand slaves to drag a stone to the pyramid or burned down a house to\r\nroast a pig. Not until his laboratory is as cool and calm and\r\ncomfortable as the forest and the field can the chemist call himself\r\ncompletely successful.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his clumsiness the chemist is actually making things\r\nthat he wants and cannot get elsewhere. The calcium carbide that he\r\nmanufactures from inorganic material serves as the raw material for\r\nproducing all sorts of organic compounds. The electric furnace was first\r\nemployed on a large scale by the Cowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum\r\nCompany at Cleveland in 1885. On the dump were found certain lumps of\r\nporous gray stone which, dropped into water, gave off a gas that\r\nexploded at touch of a match with a splendid bang and flare. This gas\r\nwas acetylene, and we can represent the reaction thus:\r\n\r\n  CaC_{2} + 2 H_{2}O --> C_{2}H_{2} + CaO_{2}H_{2}\r\n\r\n  calcium carbide _added_ to water _\r\n    gives_ acetylene _and_ slaked lime\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with this reaction now, for it is acetylene that\r\ngives the dazzling light of the automobiles and of the automatic signal\r\nbuoys of the seacoast. When burned with pure oxygen instead of air it\r\ngives the hottest of chemical flames, hotter even than the oxy-hydrogen\r\nblowpipe. For although a given weight of hydrogen will give off more\r\nheat when it burns than carbon will, yet acetylene will give off more\r\nheat than either of its elements or both of them when they are separate.\r\nThis is because acetylene has stored up heat in its formation instead of\r\ngiving it off as in most reactions, or to put it in chemical language,\r\nacetylene is an endothermic compound. It has required energy to bring\r\nthe H and the C together, therefore it does not require energy to\r\nseparate them, but, on the contrary, energy is released when they are\r\nseparated. That is to say, acetylene is explosive not only when mixed\r\nwith air as coal gas is but by itself. Under a suitable impulse\r\nacetylene will break up into its original carbon and hydrogen with great\r\nviolence. It explodes with twice as much force without air as ordinary\r\ncoal gas with air. It forms an explosive compound with copper, so it has\r\nto be kept out of contact with brass tubes and stopcocks. But compressed\r\nin steel cylinders and dissolved in acetone, it is safe and commonly\r\nused for welding and melting. It is a marvelous though not an unusual\r\nsight on city streets to see a man with blue glasses on cutting down\r\nthrough a steel rail with an oxy-acetylene blowpipe as easily as a\r\ncarpenter saws off a board. With such a flame he can carve out a pattern\r\nin a steel plate in a way that reminds me of the days when I used to\r\nmake brackets with a scroll saw out of cigar boxes. The torch will\r\ntravel through a steel plate an inch or two thick at a rate of six to\r\nten inches a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls\r\n\r\nMAKING ALOXITE IN THE ELECTRIC FURNACES BY FUSING COKE AND BAUXITE\r\n\r\nIn the background are the circular furnaces.

It is evidently what the chemists\r\ncall an \"unsaturated\" compound, one that has not reached its limit of\r\nhydrogenation. It is therefore a very active and energetic compound,\r\nready to pick up on the slightest instigation hydrogen or oxygen or\r\nchlorine or any other elements that happen to be handy. This is why it\r\nis so useful as a starting point for synthetic chemistry.\r\n\r\nTo build up from this simple substance, acetylene, the higher compounds\r\nof carbon and oxygen it is necessary to call in the aid of that\r\nmysterious agency, the catalyst. Acetylene is not always acted upon by\r\nwater, as we know, for we see it bubbling up through the water when\r\nprepared from the carbide. But if to the water be added a little acid\r\nand a mercury salt, the acetylene gas will unite with the water forming\r\na new compound, acetaldehyde. We can show the change most simply in this\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n  C_{2}H_{2} + H_{2}O --> C_{2}H_{4}O\r\n\r\n  acetylene _added to_ water _forms_ acetaldehyde\r\n\r\nAcetaldehyde is not of much importance in itself, but is useful as a\r\ntransition. If its vapor mixed with hydrogen is passed over finely\r\ndivided nickel, serving as a catalyst, the two unite and we have\r\nalcohol, according to this reaction:\r\n\r\n  C_{2}H_{4}O + H_{2} --> C_{2}H_{6}O\r\n\r\n  acetaldehyde _added to_ hydrogen _forms_ alcohol\r\n\r\nAlcohol we are all familiar with--some of us too familiar, but the\r\nprohibition laws will correct that. The point to be noted is that the\r\nalcohol we have made from such unpromising materials as limestone and\r\ncoal is exactly the same alcohol as is obtained by the fermentation of\r\nfruits and grains by the yeast plant as in wine and beer. It is not a\r\nsubstitute or imitation. It is not the wood spirits (methyl alcohol,\r\nCH_{4}O), produced by the destructive distillation of wood, equally\r\nserviceable as a solvent or fuel, but undrinkable and poisonous.\r\n\r\nNow, as we all know, cider and wine when exposed to the air gradually\r\nturn into vinegar, that is, by the growth of bacteria the alcohol is\r\noxidized to acetic acid. We can, if we like, dispense with the bacteria\r\nand speed up the process by employing a catalyst. Acetaldehyde, which is\r\nhalfway between alcohol and acid, may also be easily oxidized to acetic\r\nacid. The relationship is readily seen by this:\r\n\r\n  C{2}H_{6}O -->  CC_{2}H_{4}O --> C_{2}H_{4}O_{3}\r\n\r\n  alcohol         acetaldehyde      acetic acid\r\n\r\nAcetic acid, familiar to us in a diluted and flavored form as vinegar,\r\nis when concentrated of great value in industry, especially as a\r\nsolvent. I have already referred to its use in combination with\r\ncellulose as a \"dope\" for varnishing airplane canvas or making\r\nnon-inflammable film for motion pictures. Its combination with lime,\r\ncalcium acetate, when heated gives acetone, which, as may be seen from\r\nits formula (C_{3}H_{6}O) is closely related to the other compounds we\r\nhave been considering, but it is neither an alcohol nor an acid. It is\r\nextensively employed as a solvent.\r\n\r\nAcetone is not only useful for dissolving solids but it will under\r\npressure dissolve many times its volume of gaseous acetylene. This is a\r\nconvenient way of transporting and handling acetylene for lighting or\r\nwelding.\r\n\r\nIf instead of simply mixing the acetone and acetylene in a solution we\r\ncombine them chemically we can get isoprene, which is the mother\r\nsubstance of ordinary India rubber. From acetone also is made the \"war\r\nrubber\" of the Germans (methyl rubber), which I have mentioned in a\r\nprevious chapter. The Germans had been getting about half their supply\r\nof acetone from American acetate of lime and this was of course shut\r\noff. That which was produced in Germany by the distillation of beech\r\nwood was not even enough for the high explosives needed at the front. So\r\nthe Germans resorted to rotting potatoes--or rather let us say, since it\r\nsounds better--to the cultivation of _Bacillus macerans_. This\r\nparticular bacillus converts the starch of the potato into two-thirds\r\nalcohol and one-third acetone. But soon potatoes got too scarce to be\r\nused up in this fashion, so the Germans turned to calcium carbide as a\r\nsource of acetone and before the war ended they had a factory capable of\r\nmanufacturing 2000 tons of methyl rubber a year. This shows the\r\nadvantage of having several strings to a bow.\r\n\r\nThe reason why acetylene is such an active and acquisitive thing the\r\nchemist explains, or rather expresses, by picturing its structure in\r\nthis shape:\r\n\r\n  H-C[triple bond]C-H\r\n\r\nNow the carbon atoms are holding each other's hands because they have\r\nnothing else to do. There are no other elements around to hitch on to.\r\nBut the two carbons of acetylene readily loosen up and keeping the\r\nconnection between them by a single bond reach out in this fashion with\r\ntheir two disengaged arms and grab whatever alien atoms happen to be in\r\nthe vicinity:\r\n\r\n    | |\r\n  H-C-C-H\r\n    | |\r\n\r\nCarbon atoms belong to the quadrumani like the monkeys, so they are\r\npeculiarly fitted to forming chains and rings. This accounts for the\r\nvariety and complexity of the carbon compounds.\r\n\r\nSo when acetylene gas mixed with other gases is passed over a catalyst,\r\nsuch as a heated mass of iron ore or clay (hydrates or silicates of iron\r\nor aluminum), it forms all sorts of curious combinations. In the\r\npresence of steam we may get such simple compounds as acetic acid,\r\nacetone and the like. But when three acetylene molecules join to form a\r\nring of six carbon atoms we get compounds of the benzene series such as\r\nwere described in the chapter on the coal-tar colors. If ammonia is\r\nmixed with acetylene we may get rings with the nitrogen atom in place of\r\none of the carbons, like the pyridins and quinolins, pungent bases such\r\nas are found in opium and tobacco. Or if hydrogen sulfide is mixed with\r\nthe acetylene we may get thiophenes, which have sulfur in the ring. So,\r\nstarting with the simple combination of two atoms of carbon with two of\r\nhydrogen, we can get directly by this single process some of the most\r\ncomplicated compounds of the organic world, as well as many others not\r\nfound in nature.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the electric furnace America played a pioneer\r\npart. Provost Smith of the University of Pennsylvania, who is the best\r\nauthority on the history of chemistry in America, claims for Robert\r\nHare, a Philadelphia chemist born in 1781, the honor of constructing the\r\nfirst electrical furnace. With this crude apparatus and with no greater\r\nelectromotive force than could be attained from a voltaic pile, he\r\nconverted charcoal into graphite, volatilized phosphorus from its\r\ncompounds, isolated metallic calcium and synthesized calcium carbide. It\r\nis to Hare also that we owe the invention in 1801 of the oxy-hydrogen\r\nblowpipe, which nowadays is used with acetylene as well as hydrogen.\r\nWith this instrument he was able to fuse strontia and volatilize\r\nplatinum.\r\n\r\nBut the electrical furnace could not be used on a commercial scale until\r\nthe dynamo replaced the battery as a source of electricity. The\r\nindustrial development of the electrical furnace centered about the\r\nsearch for a cheap method of preparing aluminum. This is the metallic\r\nbase of clay and therefore is common enough. But clay, as we know from\r\nits use in making porcelain, is very infusible and difficult to\r\ndecompose. Sixty years ago aluminum was priced at $140 a pound, but one\r\nwould have had difficulty in buying such a large quantity as a pound at\r\nany price. At international expositions a small bar of it might be seen\r\nin a case labeled \"silver from clay.\" Mechanics were anxious to get the\r\nnew metal, for it was light and untarnishable, but the metallurgists\r\ncould not furnish it to them at a low enough price. In order to extract\r\nit from clay a more active metal, sodium, was essential. But sodium also\r\nwas rare and expensive. In those days a professor of chemistry used to\r\nkeep a little stick of it in a bottle under kerosene and once a year he\r\nwhittled off a piece the size of a pea and threw it into water to show\r\nthe class how it sizzled and gave off hydrogen. The way to get cheaper\r\naluminum was, it seemed, to get cheaper sodium and Hamilton Young\r\nCastner set himself at this problem. He was a Brooklyn boy, a student of\r\nChandler's at Columbia. You can see the bronze tablet in his honor at\r\nthe entrance of Havemeyer Hall. In 1886 he produced metallic sodium by\r\nmixing caustic soda with iron and charcoal in an iron pot and heating in\r\na gas furnace. Before this experiment sodium sold at $2 a pound; after\r\nit sodium sold at twenty cents a pound.\r\n\r\nBut although Castner had succeeded in his experiment he was defeated in\r\nhis object. For while he was perfecting the sodium process for making\r\naluminum the electrolytic process for getting aluminum directly was\r\ndiscovered in Oberlin. So the $250,000 plant of the \"Aluminium Company\r\nLtd.\" that Castner had got erected at Birmingham, England, did not make\r\naluminum at all, but produced sodium for other purposes instead. Castner\r\nthen turned his attention to the electrolytic method of producing sodium\r\nby the use of the power of Niagara Falls, electric power. Here in 1894\r\nhe succeeded in separating common salt into its component elements,\r\nchlorine and sodium, by passing the electric current through brine and\r\ncollecting the sodium in the mercury floor of the cell. The sodium by\r\nthe action of water goes into caustic soda. Nowadays sodium and chlorine\r\nand their components are made in enormous quantities by the\r\ndecomposition of salt. The United States Government in 1918 procured\r\nnearly 4,000,000 pounds of chlorine for gas warfare.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the electrical process of making aluminum that\r\ndisplaced the sodium method was due to Charles M. Hall. He was the son\r\nof a Congregational minister and as a boy took a fancy to chemistry\r\nthrough happening upon an old text-book of that science in his father's\r\nlibrary. He never knew who the author was, for the cover and title page\r\nhad been torn off. The obstacle in the way of the electrolytic\r\nproduction of aluminum was, as I have said, because its compounds were\r\nso hard to melt that the current could not pass through. In 1886, when\r\nHall was twenty-two, he solved the problem in the laboratory of Oberlin\r\nCollege with no other apparatus than a small crucible, a gasoline burner\r\nto heat it with and a galvanic battery to supply the electricity. He\r\nfound that a Greenland mineral, known as cryolite (a double fluoride of\r\nsodium and aluminum), was readily fused and would dissolve alumina\r\n(aluminum oxide). When an electric current was passed through the melted\r\nmass the metal aluminum would collect at one of the poles.\r\n\r\nIn working out the process and defending his claims Hall used up all his\r\nown money, his brother's and his uncle's, but he won out in the end and\r\nJudge Taft held that his patent had priority over the French claim of\r\nHérault. On his death, a few years ago, Hall left his large fortune to\r\nhis Alma Mater, Oberlin.\r\n\r\nTwo other young men from Ohio, Alfred and Eugene Cowles, with whom Hall\r\nwas for a time associated, wore the first to develop the wide\r\npossibilities of the electric furnace on a commercial scale. In 1885\r\nthey started the Cowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company at\r\nLockport, New York, using Niagara power. The various aluminum bronzes\r\nmade by absorbing the electrolyzed aluminum in copper attracted\r\nimmediate attention by their beauty and usefulness in electrical work\r\nand later the company turned out other products besides aluminum, such\r\nas calcium carbide, phosphorus, and carborundum. They got carborundum as\r\nearly as 1885 but miscalled it \"crystallized silicon,\" so its\r\nintroduction was left to E.A. Acheson, who was a graduate of Edison's\r\nlaboratory. In 1891 he packed clay and charcoal into an iron bowl,\r\nconnected it to a dynamo and stuck into the mixture an electric light\r\ncarbon connected to the other pole of the dynamo. When he pulled out the\r\nrod he found its end encrusted with glittering crystals of an unknown\r\nsubstance. They were blue and black and iridescent, exceedingly hard and\r\nvery beautiful. He sold them at first by the carat at a rate that would\r\namount to $560 a pound. They were as well worth buying as diamond dust,\r\nbut those who purchased them must have regretted it, for much finer\r\ncrystals were soon on sale at ten cents a pound. The mysterious\r\nsubstance turned out to be a compound of carbon and silicon, the\r\nsimplest possible compound, one atom of each, CSi. Acheson set up a\r\nfactory at Niagara, where he made it in ten-ton batches. The furnace\r\nconsisted simply of a brick box fifteen feet long and seven feet wide\r\nand deep, with big carbon electrodes at the ends. Between them was\r\npacked a mixture of coke to supply the carbon, sand to supply the\r\nsilicon, sawdust to make the mass porous and salt to make it fusible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The first American electric furnace, constructed by\r\nRobert Hare of Philadelphia. From \"Chemistry in America,\" by Edgar Fahs\r\nSmith]\r\n\r\nThe substance thus produced at Niagara Falls is known as \"carborundum\"\r\nsouth of the American-Canadian boundary and as \"crystolon\" north of this\r\nline, as \"carbolon\" by another firm, and as \"silicon carbide\" by\r\nchemists the world over. Since it is next to the diamond in hardness it\r\ntakes off metal faster than emery (aluminum oxide), using less power and\r\nwasting less heat in futile fireworks. It is used for grindstones of\r\nall sizes, including those the dentist uses on your teeth. It has\r\nrevolutionized shop-practice, for articles can be ground into shape\r\nbetter and quicker than they can be cut. What is more, the artificial\r\nabrasives do not injure the lungs of the operatives like sandstone. The\r\noutput of artificial abrasives in the United States and Canada for 1917\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n                         Tons        Value\r\n  Silicon carbide       8,323       $1,074,152\r\n  Aluminum oxide       48,463        6,969,387\r\n\r\nA new use for carborundum was found during the war when Uncle Sam\r\nassumed the rôle of Jove as \"cloud-compeller.\" Acting on carborundum\r\nwith chlorine--also, you remember, a product of electrical\r\ndissolution--the chlorine displaces the carbon, forming silicon\r\ntetra-chloride (SiCl_{4}), a colorless liquid resembling chloroform.\r\nWhen this comes in contact with moist air it gives off thick, white\r\nfumes, for water decomposes it, giving a white powder (silicon\r\nhydroxide) and hydrochloric acid. If ammonia is present the acid will\r\nunite with it, giving further white fumes of the salt, ammonium\r\nchloride. So a mixture of two parts of silicon chloride with one part of\r\ndry ammonia was used in the war to produce smoke-screens for the\r\nconcealment of the movements of troops, batteries and vessels or put in\r\nshells so the outlook could see where they burst and so get the range.\r\nTitanium tetra-chloride, a similar substance, proved 50 per cent. better\r\nthan silicon, but phosphorus--which also we get from the electric\r\nfurnace--was the most effective mistifier of all.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of the artificial abrasives fine grinding was\r\nmostly done by emery, which is an impure form of aluminum oxide found in\r\nnature. A purer form is made from the mineral bauxite by driving off its\r\ncombined water. Bauxite is the ore from which is made the pure aluminum\r\noxide used in the electric furnace for the production of metallic\r\naluminum. Formerly we imported a large part of our bauxite from France,\r\nbut when the war shut off this source we developed our domestic fields\r\nin Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia, and these are now producing half a\r\nmillion tons a year. Bauxite simply fused in the electric furnace makes\r\na better abrasive than the natural emery or corundum, and it is sold for\r\nthis purpose under the name of \"aloxite,\" \"alundum,\" \"exolon,\" \"lionite\"\r\nor \"coralox.\" When the fused bauxite is worked up with a bonding\r\nmaterial into crucibles or muffles and baked in a kiln it forms the\r\nalundum refractory ware. Since alundum is porous and not attacked by\r\nacids it is used for filtering hot and corrosive liquids that would eat\r\nup filter-paper. Carborundum or crystolon is also made up into\r\nrefractory ware for high temperature work. When the fused mass of the\r\ncarborundum furnace is broken up there is found surrounding the\r\ncarborundum core a similar substance though not quite so hard and\r\ninfusible, known as \"carborundum sand\" or \"siloxicon.\" This is mixed\r\nwith fireclay and used for furnace linings.\r\n\r\nMany new forms of refractories have come into use to meet the demands of\r\nthe new high temperature work. The essentials are that it should not\r\nmelt or crumble at high heat and should not expand and contract greatly\r\nunder changes of temperature (low coefficient of thermal expansion).\r\nWhether it is desirable that it should heat through readily or slowly\r\n(coefficient of thermal conductivity) depends on whether it is wanted as\r\na crucible or as a furnace lining. Lime (calcium oxide) fuses only at\r\nthe highest heat of the electric furnace, but it breaks down into dust.\r\nMagnesia (magnesium oxide) is better and is most extensively employed.\r\nFor every ton of steel produced five pounds of magnesite is needed.\r\nFormerly we imported 90 per cent. of our supply from Austria, but now we\r\nget it from California and Washington. In 1913 the American production\r\nof magnesite was only 9600 tons. In 1918 it was 225,000. Zirconia\r\n(zirconium oxide) is still more refractory and in spite of its greater\r\ncost zirkite is coming into use as a lining for electric furnaces.\r\n\r\nSilicon is next to oxygen the commonest element in the world. It forms a\r\nquarter of the earth's crust, yet it is unfamiliar to most of us. That\r\nis because it is always found combined with oxygen in the form of silica\r\nas quartz crystal or sand. This used to be considered too refractory to\r\nbe blown but is found to be easily manipulable at the high temperatures\r\nnow at the command of the glass-blower. So the chemist rejoices in\r\nflasks that he can heat red hot in the Bunsen burner and then plunge\r\ninto ice water without breaking, and the cook can bake and serve in a\r\ndish of \"pyrex,\" which is 80 per cent. silica.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century minute specimens of silicon\r\nwere sold as laboratory curiosities at the price of $100 an ounce. Two\r\nyears later it was turned out by the barrelful at Niagara as an\r\naccidental by-product and could not find a market at ten cents a pound.\r\nSilicon from the electric furnace appears in the form of hard,\r\nglittering metallic crystals.\r\n\r\nAn alloy of iron and silicon, ferro-silicon, made by heating a mixture\r\nof iron ore, sand and coke in the electrical furnace, is used as a\r\ndeoxidizing agent in the manufacture of steel.\r\n\r\nSince silicon has been robbed with difficulty of its oxygen it takes it\r\non again with great avidity. This has been made use of in the making of\r\nhydrogen. A mixture of silicon (or of the ferro-silicon alloy containing\r\n90 per cent. of silicon) with soda and slaked lime is inert, compact and\r\ncan be transported to any point where hydrogen is needed, say at a\r\nbattle front. Then the \"hydrogenite,\" as the mixture is named, is\r\nignited by a hot iron ball and goes off like thermit with the production\r\nof great heat and the evolution of a vast volume of hydrogen gas. Or the\r\nferro-silicon may be simply burned in an atmosphere of steam in a closed\r\ntank after ignition with a pinch of gunpowder. The iron and the silicon\r\nrevert to their oxides while the hydrogen of the water is set free. The\r\nFrench \"silikol\" method consists in treating silicon with a 40 per cent.\r\nsolution of soda.\r\n\r\nAnother source of hydrogen originating with the electric furnace is\r\n\"hydrolith,\" which consists of calcium hydride. Metallic calcium is\r\nprepared from lime in the electric furnace. Then pieces of the calcium\r\nare spread out in an oven heated by electricity and a current of dry\r\nhydrogen passed through. The gas is absorbed by the metal, forming the\r\nhydride (CaH_{2}). This is packed up in cans and when hydrogen is\r\ndesired it is simply dropped into water, when it gives off the gas just\r\nas calcium carbide gives off acetylene.\r\n\r\nThis last reaction was also used in Germany for filling Zeppelins. For\r\ncalcium carbide is convenient and portable and acetylene, when it is\r\nonce started, as by an electric shock, decomposes spontaneously by its\r\nown internal heat into hydrogen and carbon. The latter is left as a\r\nfine, pure lampblack, suitable for printer's ink.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, who was always on the lookout for new inventions that could be\r\nutilized for military purposes, seized immediately upon the balloon as\r\nan observation station. Within a few years after the first ascent had\r\nbeen made in Paris Napoleon took balloons and apparatus for generating\r\nhydrogen with him on his \"archeological expedition\" to Egypt in which he\r\nhoped to conquer Asia. But the British fleet in the Mediterranean put a\r\nstop to this experiment by intercepting the ship, and military aviation\r\nwaited until the Great War for its full development. This caused a\r\nsudden demand for immense quantities of hydrogen and all manner of means\r\nwas taken to get it. Water is easily decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen\r\nby passing an electric current through it. In various electrolytical\r\nprocesses hydrogen has been a wasted by-product since the balloon demand\r\nwas slight and it was more bother than it was worth to collect and\r\npurify the hydrogen. Another way of getting hydrogen in quantity is by\r\npassing steam over red-hot coke. This produces the blue water-gas, which\r\ncontains about 50 per cent. hydrogen, 40 per cent. carbon monoxide and\r\nthe rest nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The last is removed by running the\r\nmixed gases through lime. Then the nitrogen and carbon monoxide are\r\nfrozen out in an air-liquefying apparatus and the hydrogen escapes to\r\nthe storage tank. The liquefied carbon monoxide, allowed to regain its\r\ngaseous form, is used in an internal combustion engine to run the plant.\r\n\r\nThere are then many ways of producing hydrogen, but it is so light and\r\nbulky that it is difficult to get it where it is wanted. The American\r\nGovernment in the war made use of steel cylinders each holding 161 cubic\r\nfeet of the gas under a pressure of 2000 pounds per square inch. Even\r\nthe hydrogen used by the troops in France was shipped from America in\r\nthis form. For field use the ferro-silicon and soda process was adopted.\r\nA portable generator of this type was capable of producing 10,000 cubic\r\nfeet of the gas per hour.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by a Kansas chemist of natural sources of helium may make\r\nit possible to free ballooning of its great danger, for helium is\r\nnon-inflammable and almost as light as hydrogen.\r\n\r\nOther uses of hydrogen besides ballooning have already been referred to\r\nin other chapters. It is combined with nitrogen to form synthetic\r\nammonia. It is combined with oxygen in the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe to\r\nproduce heat. It is combined with vegetable and animal oils to convert\r\nthem into solid fats. There is also the possibility of using it as a\r\nfuel in the internal combustion engine in place of gasoline, but for\r\nthis purpose we must find some way of getting hydrogen portable or\r\nproducible in a compact form.\r\n\r\nAluminum, like silicon, sodium and calcium, has been rescued by violence\r\nfrom its attachment to oxygen and like these metals it reverts with\r\nreadiness to its former affinity. Dr. Goldschmidt made use of this\r\nreaction in his thermit process. Powdered aluminum is mixed with iron\r\noxide (rust). If the mixture is heated at any point a furious struggle\r\ntakes place throughout the whole mass between the iron and the aluminum\r\nas to which metal shall get the oxygen, and the aluminum always comes\r\nout ahead. The temperature runs up to some 6000 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nwithin thirty seconds and the freed iron, completely liquefied, runs\r\ndown into the bottom of the crucible, where it may be drawn off by\r\nopening a trap door. The newly formed aluminum oxide (alumina) floats as\r\nslag on top. The applications of the thermit process are innumerable.\r\nIf, for instance, it is desired to mend a broken rail or crank shaft\r\nwithout moving it from its place, the two ends are brought together or\r\nfixed at the proper distance apart. A crucible filled with the thermit\r\nmixture is set up above the joint and the thermit ignited with a priming\r\nof aluminum and barium peroxide to start it off. The barium peroxide\r\nhaving a superabundance of oxygen gives it up readily and the aluminum\r\nthus encouraged attacks the iron oxide and robs it of its oxygen. As\r\nsoon as the iron is melted it is run off through the bottom of the\r\ncrucible and fills the space between the rail ends, being kept from\r\nspreading by a mold of refractory material such as magnesite. The two\r\nends of the rail are therefore joined by a section of the same size,\r\nshape, substance and strength as themselves. The same process can be\r\nused for mending a fracture or supplying a missing fragment of a steel\r\ncasting of any size, such as a ship's propeller or a cogwheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPES OF GAS MASK USED BY AMERICA, THE ALLIES, AND\r\nGERMANY DURING THE WAR\r\n\r\nIn the top row are the American masks, chronologically, from left to\r\nright: U.S. Navy mask (obsolete), U.S. Navy mask (final type), U.S. Army\r\nbox respirator (used throughout the war), U.S.R.F.K. respirator,\r\nU.S.A.T. respirator (an all-rubber mask), U.S.K.T. respirator (a sewed\r\nfabric mask), and U.S. \"Model 1919,\" ready for production when the\r\narmistice was signed.

The large truck in the foreground contains loaded shell]\r\n\r\nFor smaller work thermit has two rivals, the oxy-acetylene torch and\r\nelectric welding. The former has been described and the latter is rather\r\nout of the range of this volume, although I may mention that in the\r\nlatter part of 1918 there was launched from a British shipyard the first\r\nrivotless steel vessel. In this the steel plates forming the shell,\r\nbulkheads and floors are welded instead of being fastened together by\r\nrivets. There are three methods of doing this depending upon the\r\nthickness of the plates and the sort of strain they are subject to. The\r\nplates may be overlapped and tacked together at intervals by pressing\r\nthe two electrodes on opposite sides of the same point until the spot is\r\nsufficiently heated to fuse together the plates here. Or roller\r\nelectrodes may be drawn slowly along the line of the desired weld,\r\nfusing the plates together continuously as they go. Or, thirdly, the\r\nplates may be butt-welded by being pushed together edge to edge without\r\noverlapping and the electric current being passed from one plate to the\r\nother heats up the joint where the conductivity is interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the thermit process is essentially like the\r\nordinary blast furnace process of smelting iron and other metals except\r\nthat aluminum is used instead of carbon to take the oxygen away from the\r\nmetal in the ore. This has an advantage in case carbon-free metals are\r\ndesired and the process is used for producing manganese, tungsten,\r\ntitanium, molybdenum, vanadium and their allows with iron and copper.\r\n\r\nDuring the war thermit found a new and terrible employment, as it was\r\nused by the airmen for setting buildings on fire and exploding\r\nammunition dumps. The German incendiary bombs consisted of a perforated\r\nsteel nose-piece, a tail to keep it falling straight and a cylindrical\r\nbody which contained a tube of thermit packed around with mineral wax\r\ncontaining potassium perchlorate. The fuse was ignited as the missile\r\nwas released and the thermit, as it heated up, melted the wax and\r\nallowed it to flow out together with the liquid iron through the holes\r\nin the nose-piece. The American incendiary bombs were of a still more\r\nmalignant type. They weighed about forty pounds apiece and were charged\r\nwith oil emulsion, thermit and metallic sodium. Sodium decomposes water\r\nso that if any attempt were made to put out with a hose a fire started\r\nby one of these bombs the stream of water would be instantaneously\r\nchanged into a jet of blazing hydrogen.\r\n\r\nBesides its use in combining and separating different elements the\r\nelectric furnace is able to change a single element into its various\r\nforms. Carbon, for instance, is found in three very distinct forms: in\r\nhard, transparent and colorless crystals as the diamond, in black,\r\nopaque, metallic scales as graphite, and in shapeless masses and powder\r\nas charcoal, coke, lampblack, and the like. In the intense heat of the\r\nelectric arc these forms are convertible one into the other according to\r\nthe conditions. Since the third form is the cheapest the object is to\r\nchange it into one of the other two. Graphite, plumbago or \"blacklead,\"\r\nas it is still sometimes called, is not found in many places and more\r\nrarely found pure. The supply was not equal to the demand until Acheson\r\nworked out the process of making it by packing powdered anthracite\r\nbetween the electrodes of his furnace. In this way graphite can be\r\ncheaply produced in any desired quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nSince graphite is infusible and incombustible except at exceedingly high\r\ntemperatures, it is extensively used for crucibles and electrodes. These\r\nelectrodes are made in all sizes for the various forms of electric lamps\r\nand furnaces from rods one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter to bars a\r\nfoot thick and six feet long. It is graphite mixed with fine clay to\r\ngive it the desired degree of hardness that forms the filling of our\r\n\"lead\" pencils. Finely ground and flocculent graphite treated with\r\ntannin may be held in suspension in liquids and even pass through\r\nfilter-paper. The mixture with water is sold under the name of\r\n\"aquadag,\" with oil as \"oildag\" and with grease as \"gredag,\" for\r\nlubrication. The smooth, slippery scales of graphite in suspension slide\r\nover each other easily and keep the bearings from rubbing against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe other and more difficult metamorphosis of carbon, the transformation\r\nof charcoal into diamond, was successfully accomplished by Moissan in\r\n1894. Henri Moissan was a toxicologist, that is to say, a Professor of\r\nPoisoning, in the Paris School of Pharmacy, who took to experimenting\r\nwith the electric furnace in his leisure hours and did more to\r\ndemonstrate its possibilities than any other man. With it he isolated\r\nfluorine, most active of the elements, and he prepared for the first\r\ntime in their purity many of the rare metals that have since found\r\nindustrial employment. He also made the carbides of the various metals,\r\nincluding the now common calcium carbide. Among the problems that he\r\nundertook and solved was the manufacture of artificial diamonds. He\r\nfirst made pure charcoal by burning sugar. This was packed with iron in\r\nthe hollow of a block of lime into which extended from opposite sides\r\nthe carbon rods connected to the dynamo. When the iron had melted and\r\ndissolved all the carbon it could, Moissan dumped it into water or\r\nbetter into melted lead or into a hole in a copper block, for this\r\ncooled it most rapidly. After a crust was formed it was left to solidify\r\nslowly. The sudden cooling of the iron on the outside subjected the\r\ncarbon, which was held in solution, to intense pressure and when the bit\r\nof iron was dissolved in acid some of the carbon was found to be\r\ncrystallized as diamond, although most of it was graphite. To be sure,\r\nthe diamonds were hardly big enough to be seen with the naked eye, but\r\nsince Moissan's aim was to make diamonds, not big diamonds, he ceased\r\nhis efforts at this point.\r\n\r\nTo produce large diamonds the carbon would have to be liquefied in\r\nconsiderable quantity and kept in that state while it slowly\r\ncrystallized. But that could only be accomplished at a temperature and\r\npressure and duration unattainable as yet. Under ordinary atmospheric\r\npressure carbon passes over from the solid to the gaseous phase without\r\npassing through the liquid, just as snow on a cold, clear day will\r\nevaporate without melting.\r\n\r\nProbably some one in the future will take up the problem where Moissan\r\ndropped it and find out how to make diamonds of any size. But it is not\r\na question that greatly interests either the scientist or the\r\nindustrialist because there is not much to be learned from it and not\r\nmuch to be made out of it. If the inventor of a process for making\r\ncheap diamonds could keep his electric furnace secretly in his cellar\r\nand market his diamonds cautiously he might get rich out of it, but he\r\nwould not dare to turn out very large stones or too many of them, for if\r\na suspicion got around that he was making them the price would fall to\r\nalmost nothing even if he did sell another one. For the high price of\r\nthe diamond is purely fictitious. It is in the first place kept up by\r\nlimiting the output of the natural stone by the combination of dealers\r\nand, further, the diamond is valued not for its usefulness or beauty but\r\nby its real or supposed rarity. Chesterton says: \"All is gold that\r\nglitters, for the glitter is the gold.\" This is not so true of gold, for\r\nif gold were as cheap as nickel it would be very valuable, since we\r\nshould gold-plate our machinery, our ships, our bridges and our roofs.\r\nBut if diamonds were cheap they would be good for nothing except\r\ngrindstones and drills. An imitation diamond made of heavy glass (paste)\r\ncannot be distinguished from the genuine gem except by an expert. It\r\nsparkles about as brilliantly, for its refractive index is nearly as\r\nhigh. The reason why it is not priced so highly is because the natural\r\nstone has presumably been obtained through the toil and sweat of\r\nhundreds of negroes searching in the blue ground of the Transvaal for\r\nmany months. It is valued exclusively by its cost. To wear a diamond\r\nnecklace is the same as hanging a certified check for $100,000 by a\r\nstring around the neck.\r\n\r\nReal values are enhanced by reduction in the cost of the price of\r\nproduction. Fictitious values are destroyed by it. Aluminum at\r\ntwenty-five cents a pound is immensely more valuable to the world than\r\nwhen it is a curiosity in the chemist's cabinet and priced at $160 a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nSo the scope of the electric furnace reaches from the costly but\r\ncomparatively valueless diamond to the cheap but indispensable steel. As\r\nF.J. Tone says, if the automobile manufacturers were deprived of Niagara\r\nproducts, the abrasives, aluminum, acetylene for welding and high-speed\r\ntool steel, a factory now turning out five hundred cars a day would be\r\nreduced to one hundred. I have here been chiefly concerned with\r\nelectricity as effecting chemical changes in combining or separating\r\nelements, but I must not omit to mention its rapidly extending use as a\r\nsource of heat, as in the production and casting of steel. In 1908 there\r\nwere only fifty-five tons of steel produced by the electric furnace in\r\nthe United States, but by 1918 this had risen to 511,364 tons. And\r\nbesides ordinary steel the electric furnace has given us alloys of iron\r\nwith the once \"rare metals\" that have created a new science of\r\nmetallurgy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMETALS, OLD AND NEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primitive metallurgist could only make use of such metals as he\r\nfound free in nature, that is, such as had not been attacked and\r\ncorroded by the ubiquitous oxygen. These were primarily gold or copper,\r\nthough possibly some original genius may have happened upon a bit of\r\nmeteoric iron and pounded it out into a sword. But when man found that\r\nthe red ocher he had hitherto used only as a cosmetic could be made to\r\nyield iron by melting it with charcoal he opened a new era in\r\ncivilization, though doubtless the ocher artists of that day denounced\r\nhim as a utilitarian and deplored the decadence of the times.\r\n\r\nIron is one of the most timid of metals. It has a great disinclination\r\nto be alone. It is also one of the most altruistic of the elements. It\r\nlikes almost every other element better than itself. It has an especial\r\naffection for oxygen, and, since this is in both air and water, and\r\nthese are everywhere, iron is not long without a mate. The result of\r\nthis union goes by various names in the mineralogical and chemical\r\nworlds, but in common language, which is quite good enough for our\r\npurpose, it is called iron rust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: By courtesy _Mineral Foote-Notes_.\r\n\r\nFrom Agricola's \"De Re Metallica 1550.\" Primitive furnace for smelting\r\niron ore.]\r\n\r\nNot many of us have ever seen iron, the pure metal, soft, ductile and\r\nwhite like silver. As soon as it is exposed to the air it veils itself\r\nwith a thin film of rust and becomes black and then red. For that reason\r\nthere is practically no iron in the world except what man has made. It\r\nis rarer than gold, than diamonds; we find in the earth no nuggets or\r\ncrystals of it the size of the fist as we find of these. But\r\noccasionally there fall down upon us out of the clear sky great chunks\r\nof it weighing tons. These meteorites are the mavericks of the universe.\r\nWe do not know where they come from or what sun or planet they belonged\r\nto. They are our only visitors from space, and if all the other spheres\r\nare like these fragments we know we are alone in the universe. For they\r\ncontain rustless iron, and where iron does not rust man cannot live, nor\r\ncan any other animal or any plant.\r\n\r\nIron rusts for the same reason that a stone rolls down hill, because it\r\ngets rid of its energy that way. All things in the universe are\r\nconstantly trying to get rid of energy except man, who is always trying\r\nto get more of it. Or, on second thought, we see that man is the\r\ngreatest spendthrift of all, for he wants to expend so much more energy\r\nthan he has that he borrows from the winds, the streams and the coal in\r\nthe rocks. He robs minerals and plants of the energy which they have\r\nstored up to spend for their own purposes, just as he robs the bee of\r\nits honey and the silk worm of its cocoon.\r\n\r\nMan's chief business is in reversing the processes of nature. That is\r\nthe way he gets his living. And one of his greatest triumphs was when he\r\ndiscovered how to undo iron rust and get the metal out of it. In the\r\nfour thousand years since he first did this he has accomplished more\r\nthan in the millions of years before. Without knowing the value of iron\r\nrust man could attain only to the culture of the Aztecs and Incas, the\r\nancient Egyptians and Assyrians.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of modern states is dependent on the amount of iron rust\r\nwhich they possess and utilize. England, United States, Germany, all\r\nnations are competing to see which can dig the most iron rust out of the\r\nground and make out of it railroads, bridges, buildings, machinery,\r\nbattleships and such other tools and toys and then let them relapse into\r\nrust again. Civilization can be measured by the amount of iron rusted\r\nper capita, or better, by the amount rescued from rust.\r\n\r\nBut we are devoting so much space to the consideration of the material\r\naspects of iron that we are like to neglect its esthetic and ethical\r\nuses. The beauty of nature is very largely dependent upon the fact that\r\niron rust and, in fact, all the common compounds of iron are colored.\r\nFew elements can assume so many tints. Look at the paint pot cañons of\r\nthe Yellowstone. Cheap glass bottles turn out brown, green, blue, yellow\r\nor black, according to the amount and kind of iron they contain. We\r\nbuild a house of cream-colored brick, varied with speckled brick and\r\nadorned with terra cotta ornaments of red, yellow and green, all due to\r\niron. Iron rusts, therefore it must be painted; but what is there better\r\nto paint it with than iron rust itself? It is cheap and durable, for it\r\ncannot rust any more than a dead man can die. And what is also of\r\nimportance, it is a good, strong, clean looking, endurable color.\r\nWhenever we take a trip on the railroad and see the miles of cars, the\r\nacres of roofing and wall, the towns full of brick buildings, we rejoice\r\nthat iron rust is red, not white or some leas satisfying color.\r\n\r\nWe do not know why it is so. Zinc and aluminum are metals very much like\r\niron in chemical properties, but all their salts are colorless. Why is\r\nit that the most useful of the metals forms the most beautiful\r\ncompounds? Some say, Providence; some say, chance; some say nothing. But\r\nif it had not been so we would have lost most of the beauty of rocks and\r\ntrees and human beings. For the leaves and the flowers would all be\r\nwhite, and all the men and women would look like walking corpses.\r\nWithout color in the flower what would the bees and painters do? If all\r\nthe grass and trees were white, it would be like winter all the year\r\nround. If we had white blood in our veins like some of the insects it\r\nwould be hard lines for our poets. And what would become of our morality\r\nif we could not blush?\r\n\r\n  \"As for me, I thrill to see\r\n    The bloom a velvet cheek discloses!\r\n  Made of dust! I well believe it,\r\n    So are lilies, so are roses.\"\r\n\r\nAn etiolated earth would be hardly worth living in.\r\n\r\nThe chlorophyll of the leaves and the hemoglobin of the blood are\r\nsimilar in constitution. Chlorophyll contains magnesium in place of iron\r\nbut iron is necessary to its formation. We all know how pale a plant\r\ngets if its soil is short of iron. It is the iron in the leaves that\r\nenables the plants to store up the energy of the sunshine for their own\r\nuse and ours. It is the iron in our blood that enables us to get the\r\niron out of iron rust and make it into machines to supplement our feeble\r\nhands. Iron is for us internally the carrier of energy, just as in the\r\nform of a trolley wire or of a third rail it conveys power to the\r\nelectric car. Withdraw the iron from the blood as indicated by the\r\npallor of the cheeks, and we become weak, faint and finally die. If the\r\namount of iron in the blood gets too small the disease germs that are\r\nalways attacking us are no longer destroyed, but multiply without check\r\nand conquer us. When the iron ceases to work efficiently we are killed\r\nby the poison we ourselves generate.\r\n\r\nCounting the number of iron-bearing corpuscles in the blood is now a\r\ncommon method of determining disease. It might also be useful in moral\r\ndiagnosis. A microscopical and chemical laboratory attached to the\r\ncourtroom would give information of more value than some of the evidence\r\nnow obtained. For the anemic and the florid vices need very different\r\ntreatment. An excess or a deficiency of iron in the body is liable to\r\nresult in criminality. A chemical system of morals might be developed on\r\nthis basis. Among the ferruginous sins would be placed murder, violence\r\nand licentiousness. Among the non-ferruginous, cowardice, sloth and\r\nlying. The former would be mostly sins of commission, the latter, sins\r\nof omission. The virtues could, of course, be similarly classified; the\r\nferruginous virtues would include courage, self-reliance and\r\nhopefulness; the non-ferruginous, peaceableness, meekness and chastity.\r\nAccording to this ethical criterion the moral man would be defined as\r\none whose conduct is better than we should expect from the per cent. of\r\niron in his blood.\r\n\r\nThe reason why iron is able to serve this unique purpose of conveying\r\nlife-giving air to all parts of the body is because it rusts so readily.\r\nOxidation and de-oxidation proceed so quietly that the tenderest cells\r\nare fed without injury. The blood changes from red to blue and _vice\r\nversa_ with greater ease and rapidity than in the corresponding\r\nalternations of social status in a democracy. It is because iron is so\r\nrustable that it is so useful. The factories with big scrap-heaps of\r\nrusting machinery are making the most money. The pyramids are the most\r\nenduring structures raised by the hand of man, but they have not\r\nsheltered so many people in their forty centuries as our skyscrapers\r\nthat are already rusting.\r\n\r\nWe have to carry on this eternal conflict against rust because oxygen is\r\nthe most ubiquitous of the elements and iron can only escape its ardent\r\nembraces by hiding away in the center of the earth. The united elements,\r\nknown to the chemist as iron oxide and to the outside world as rust, are\r\namong the commonest of compounds and their colors, yellow and red like\r\nthe Spanish flag, are displayed on every mountainside. From the time of\r\nTubal Cain man has ceaselessly labored to divorce these elements and,\r\nhaving once separated them, to keep them apart so that the iron may be\r\nretained in his service. But here, as usual, man is fighting against\r\nnature and his gains, as always, are only temporary. Sooner or later his\r\nvigilance is circumvented and the metal that he has extricated by the\r\nfiery furnace returns to its natural affinity. The flint arrowheads, the\r\nbronze spearpoints, the gold ornaments, the wooden idols of prehistoric\r\nman are still to be seen in our museums, but his earliest steel swords\r\nhave long since crumbled into dust.\r\n\r\nEvery year the blast furnaces of the world release 72,000,000 tons of\r\niron from its oxides and every year a large part, said to be a quarter\r\nof that amount, reverts to its primeval forms. If so, then man after\r\nfive thousand years of metallurgical industry has barely got three years\r\nahead of nature, and should he cease his efforts for a generation there\r\nwould be little left to show that man had ever learned to extract iron\r\nfrom its ores. The old question, \"What becomes of all the pins?\" may be\r\nas well asked of rails, pipes and threshing machines. The end of all\r\niron is the same. However many may be its metamorphoses while in the\r\nservice of man it relapses at last into its original state of oxidation.\r\nTo save a pound of iron from corrosion is then as much a benefit to the\r\nworld as to produce another pound from the ore. In fact it is of much\r\ngreater benefit, for it takes four pounds of coal to produce one pound\r\nof steel, so whenever a piece of iron is allowed to oxidize it means\r\nthat four times as much coal must be oxidized in order to replace it.\r\nAnd the beds of coal will be exhausted before the beds of iron ore.\r\n\r\nIf we are ever to get ahead, if we are to gain any respite from this\r\nenormous waste of labor and natural resources, we must find ways of\r\npreventing the iron which we have obtained and fashioned into useful\r\ntools from being lost through oxidation. Now there is only one way of\r\nkeeping iron and oxygen from uniting and that is to keep them apart. A\r\nvery thin dividing wall will serve for the purpose, for instance, a film\r\nof oil. But ordinary oil will rub off, so it is better to cover the\r\nsurface with an oil-like linseed which oxidizes to a hard elastic and\r\nadhesive coating. If with linseed oil we mix iron oxide or some other\r\npigment we have a paint that will protect iron perfectly so long as it\r\nis unbroken. But let the paint wear off or crack so that air can get at\r\nthe iron, then rust will form and spread underneath the paint on all\r\nsides. The same is true of the porcelain-like enamel with which our\r\nkitchen iron ware is nowadays coated. So long as the enamel holds it is\r\nall right but once it is broken through at any point it begins to scale\r\noff and gets into our food.\r\n\r\nObviously it would be better for some purposes if we could coat our\r\niron with another and less easily oxidized metal than with such\r\ndissimilar substances as paint or porcelain. Now the nearest relative to\r\niron is nickel, and a layer of this of any desired thickness may be\r\neasily deposited by electricity upon any surface however irregular.\r\nNickel takes a bright polish and keeps it well, so nickel plating has\r\nbecome the favorite method of protection for small objects where the\r\nexpense is not prohibitive. Copper plating is used for fine wires. A\r\nsheet of iron dipped in melted tin comes out coated with a thin adhesive\r\nlayer of the latter metal. Such tinned plate commonly known as \"tin\" has\r\nbecome the favorite material for pans and cans. But if the tin is\r\nscratched the iron beneath rusts more rapidly than if the tin were not\r\nthere, for an electrolytic action is set up and the iron, being the\r\nnegative element of the couple, suffers at the expense of the tin.\r\n\r\nWith zinc it is quite the opposite. Zinc is negative toward iron, so\r\nwhen the two are in contact and exposed to the weather the zinc is\r\noxidized first. A zinc plating affords the protection of a Swiss Guard,\r\nit holds out as long as possible and when broken it perishes to the last\r\natom before it lets the oxygen get at the iron. The zinc may be applied\r\nin four different ways. (1) It may be deposited by electrolysis as in\r\nnickel plating, but the zinc coating is more apt to be porous. (2) The\r\nsheets or articles may be dipped in a bath of melted zinc. This gives us\r\nthe familiar \"galvanized iron,\" the most useful and when well done the\r\nmost effective of rust preventives. Besides these older methods of\r\napplying zinc there are now two new ones. (3) One is the Schoop process\r\nby which a wire of zinc or other metal is fed into an oxy-hydrogen air\r\nblast of such heat and power that it is projected as a spray of minute\r\ndrops with the speed of bullets and any object subjected to the\r\nbombardment of this metallic mist receives a coating as thick as\r\ndesired. The zinc spray is so fine and cool that it may be received on\r\ncloth, lace, or the bare hand. The Schoop metallizing process has\r\nrecently been improved by the use of the electric current instead of the\r\nblowpipe for melting the metal. Two zinc wires connected with any\r\nelectric system, preferably the direct, are fed into the \"pistol.\" Where\r\nthe wires meet an electric arc is set up and the melted zinc is sprayed\r\nout by a jet of compressed air. (4) In the Sherardizing process the\r\narticles are put into a tight drum with zinc dust and heated to 800° F.\r\nThe zinc at this temperature attacks the iron and forms a series of\r\nalloys ranging from pure zinc on the top to pure iron at the bottom of\r\nthe coating. Even if this cracks in part the iron is more or less\r\nprotected from corrosion so long as any zinc remains. Aluminum is used\r\nsimilarly in the calorizing process for coating iron, copper or brass.\r\nFirst a surface alloy is formed by heating the metal with aluminum\r\npowder. Then the temperature is raised to a high degree so as to cause\r\nthe aluminum on the surface to diffuse into the metal and afterwards it\r\nis again baked in contact with aluminum dust which puts upon it a\r\nprotective plating of the pure aluminum which does not oxidize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOMICROGRAPHS SHOWING THE STRUCTURE OF STEEL MADE BY\r\nPROFESSOR E.G.

Steel composed of cementite (white) and pearlite (black) (enlarged 50\r\ntimes)]\r\n\r\nAnother way of protecting iron ware from rusting is to rust it. This is\r\na sort of prophylactic method like that adopted by modern medicine where\r\ninoculation with a mild culture prevents a serious attack of the\r\ndisease. The action of air and water on iron forms a series of compounds\r\nand mixtures of them. Those that contain least oxygen are hard, black\r\nand magnetic like iron itself. Those that have most oxygen are red and\r\nyellow powders. By putting on a tight coating of the black oxide we can\r\nprevent or hinder the oxidation from going on into the pulverulent\r\nstage. This is done in several ways. In the Bower-Barff process the\r\narticles to be treated are put into a closed retort and a current of\r\nsuperheated steam passed through for twenty minutes followed by a\r\ncurrent of producer gas (carbon monoxide), to reduce any higher oxides\r\nthat may have been formed. In the Gesner process a current of gasoline\r\nvapor is used as the reducing agent. The blueing of watch hands, buckles\r\nand the like may be done by dipping them into an oxidizing bath such as\r\nmelted saltpeter. But in order to afford complete protection the layer\r\nof black oxide must be thickened by repeating the process which adds to\r\nthe time and expense. This causes a slight enlargement and the high\r\ntemperature often warps the ware so it is not suitable for nicely\r\nadjusted parts of machinery and of course tools would lose their temper\r\nby the heat.\r\n\r\nA new method of rust proofing which is free from these disadvantages is\r\nthe phosphate process invented by Thomas Watts Coslett, an English\r\nchemist, in 1907, and developed in America by the Parker Company of\r\nDetroit. This consists simply in dipping the sheet iron or articles into\r\na tank filled with a dilute solution of iron phosphate heated nearly to\r\nthe boiling point by steam pipes. Bubbles of hydrogen stream off rapidly\r\nat first, then slower, and at the end of half an hour or longer the\r\naction ceases, and the process is complete. What has happened is that\r\nthe iron has been converted into a basic iron phosphate to a depth\r\ndepending upon the density of articles processed. Any one who has\r\nstudied elementary qualitative analysis will remember that when he added\r\nammonia to his \"unknown\" solution, iron and phosphoric acid, if present,\r\nwere precipitated together, or in other words, iron phosphate is\r\ninsoluble except in acids. Therefore a superficial film of such\r\nphosphate will protect the iron underneath except from acids. This film\r\nis not a coating added on the outside like paint and enamel or tin and\r\nnickel plate. It is therefore not apt to scale off and it does not\r\nincrease the size of the article. No high heat is required as in the\r\nSherardizing and Bower-Barff processes, so steel tools can be treated\r\nwithout losing their temper or edge.\r\n\r\nThe deposit consisting of ferrous and ferric phosphates mixed with black\r\niron oxide may be varied in composition, texture and color. It is\r\nordinarily a dull gray and oiling gives a soft mat black more in\r\naccordance with modern taste than the shiny nickel plating that\r\ndelighted our fathers. Even the military nowadays show more quiet taste\r\nthan formerly and have abandoned their glittering accoutrements.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate bath is not expensive and can be used continuously for\r\nmonths by adding more of the concentrated solution to keep up the\r\nstrength and removing the sludge that is precipitated. Besides the iron\r\nthe solution contains the phosphates of other metals such as calcium or\r\nstrontium, manganese, molybdenum, or tungsten, according to the\r\nparticular purpose. Since the phosphating solution does not act on\r\nnickel it may be used on articles that have been partly nickel-plated so\r\nthere may be produced, for instance, a bright raised design against a\r\ndull black background. Then, too, the surface left by the Parker process\r\nis finely etched so it affords a good attachment for paint or enamel if\r\nfurther protection is needed. Even if the enamel does crack, the iron\r\nbeneath is not so apt to rust and scale off the coating.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are some of the methods which are now being used to combat\r\nour eternal enemy, the rust that doth corrupt. All of them are useful in\r\ntheir several ways. No one of them is best for all purposes. The claim\r\nof \"rust-proof\" is no more to be taken seriously than \"fire-proof.\" We\r\nshould rather, if we were finical, have to speak of \"rust-resisting\"\r\ncoatings as we do of \"slow-burning\" buildings. Nature is insidious and\r\nunceasing in her efforts to bring to ruin the achievements of mankind\r\nand we need all the weapons we can find to frustrate her destructive\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nBut it is not enough for us to make iron superficially resistant to rust\r\nfrom the atmosphere. We should like also to make it so that it would\r\nwithstand corrosion by acids, then it could be used in place of the\r\nlarge and expensive platinum or porcelain evaporating pans and similar\r\nutensils employed in chemical works. This requirement also has been met\r\nin the non-corrosive forms of iron, which have come into use within the\r\nlast five years. One of these, \"tantiron,\" invented by a British\r\nmetallurgist, Robert N. Lennox, in 1912, contains 15 per cent. of\r\nsilicon. Similar products are known as \"duriron\" and \"Buflokast\" in\r\nAmerica, \"metilure\" in France, \"ileanite\" in Italy and \"neutraleisen\" in\r\nGermany. It is a silvery-white close-grained iron, very hard and rather\r\nbrittle, somewhat like cast iron but with silicon as the main additional\r\ningredient in place of carbon. It is difficult to cut or drill but may\r\nbe ground into shape by the new abrasives. It is rustproof and is not\r\nattacked by sulfuric, nitric or acetic acid, hot or cold, diluted or\r\nconcentrated. It does not resist so well hydrochloric acid or sulfur\r\ndioxide or alkalies.\r\n\r\nThe value of iron lies in its versatility. It is a dozen metals in one.\r\nIt can be made hard or soft, brittle or malleable, tough or weak,\r\nresistant or flexible, elastic or pliant, magnetic or non-magnetic, more\r\nor less conductive to electricity, by slight changes of composition or\r\nmere differences of treatment. No wonder that the medieval mind ascribed\r\nthese mysterious transformations to witchcraft. But the modern\r\nmicrometallurgist, by etching the surface of steel and photographing it,\r\nshows it up as composite as a block of granite. He is then able to pick\r\nout its component minerals, ferrite, austenite, martensite, pearlite,\r\ngraphite, cementite, and to show how their abundance, shape and\r\narrangement contribute to the strength or weakness of the specimen. The\r\nlast of these constituents, cementite, is a definite chemical compound,\r\nan iron carbide, Fe_{3}C, containing 6.6 per cent. of carbon, so hard as\r\nto scratch glass, very brittle, and imparting these properties to\r\nhardened steel and cast iron.\r\n\r\nWith this knowledge at his disposal the iron-maker can work with his\r\neyes open and so regulate his melt as to cause these various\r\nconstituents to crystallize out as he wants them to. Besides, he is no\r\nlonger confined to the alloys of iron and carbon. He has ransacked the\r\nchemical dictionary to find new elements to add to his alloys, and some\r\nof these rarities have proved to possess great practical value.\r\nVanadium, for instance, used to be put into a fine print paragraph in\r\nthe back of the chemistry book, where the class did not get to it until\r\nthe term closed. Yet if it had not been for vanadium steel we should\r\nhave no Ford cars. Tungsten, too, was relegated to the rear, and if the\r\nstudent remembered it at all it was because it bothered him to\r\nunderstand why its symbol should be W instead of T. But the student of\r\ntoday studies his lesson in the light of a tungsten wire and relieves\r\nhis mind by listening to a phonograph record played with a \"tungs-tone\"\r\nstylus. When I was assistant in chemistry an \"analysis\" of steel\r\nconsisted merely in the determination of its percentage of carbon, and I\r\nused to take Saturday for it so I could have time enough to complete the\r\ncombustion. Now the chemists of a steel works' laboratory may have to\r\ndetermine also the tungsten, chromium, vanadium, titanium, nickel,\r\ncobalt, phosphorus, molybdenum, manganese, silicon and sulfur, any or\r\nall of them, and be spry about it, because if they do not get the report\r\nout within fifteen minutes while the steel is melting in the electrical\r\nfurnace the whole batch of 75 tons may go wrong. I'm glad I quit the\r\nlaboratory before they got to speeding up chemists so.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the steel depends upon the presence and the relative\r\nproportions of these ingredients, and a variation of a tenth of 1 per\r\ncent. in certain of them will make a different metal out of it. For\r\ninstance, the steel becomes stronger and tougher as the proportion of\r\nnicked is increased up to about 15 per cent. Raising the percentage to\r\n25 we get an alloy that does not rust or corrode and is non-magnetic,\r\nalthough both its component metals, iron and nickel, are by themselves\r\nattracted by the magnet. With 36 per cent. nickel and 5 per cent.\r\nmanganese we get the alloy known as \"invar,\" because it expands and\r\ncontracts very little with changes of temperature. A bar of the best\r\nform of invar will expand less than one-millionth part of its length for\r\na rise of one degree Centigrade at ordinary atmospheric temperature. For\r\nthis reason it is used in watches and measuring instruments. The alloy\r\nof iron with 46 per cent. nickel is called \"platinite\" because its rate\r\nof expansion and contraction is the same as platinum and glass, and so\r\nit can be used to replace the platinum wire passing through the glass of\r\nan electric light bulb.\r\n\r\nA manganese steel of 11 to 14 per cent. is too hard to be machined. It\r\nhas to be cast or ground into shape and is used for burglar-proof safes\r\nand armor plate. Chrome steel is also hard and tough and finds use in\r\nfiles, ball bearings and projectiles. Titanium, which the iron-maker\r\nused to regard as his implacable enemy, has been drafted into service as\r\na deoxidizer, increasing the strength and elasticity of the steel. It is\r\nreported from France that the addition of three-tenths of 1 per cent. of\r\nzirconium to nickel steel has made it more resistant to the German\r\nperforating bullets than any steel hitherto known. The new \"stainless\"\r\ncutlery contains 12 to 14 per cent. of chromium.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of harder steels came the need of tougher tools to\r\nwork them. Now the virtue of a good tool steel is the same as of a good\r\nman. It must be able to get hot without losing its temper. Steel of the\r\nold-fashioned sort, as everybody knows, gets its temper by being heated\r\nto redness and suddenly cooled by quenching or plunging it into water or\r\noil. But when the point gets heated up again, as it does by friction in\r\na lathe, it softens and loses its cutting edge. So the necessity of\r\nkeeping the tool cool limited the speed of the machine.\r\n\r\nBut about 1868 a Sheffield metallurgist, Robert F. Mushet, found that a\r\npiece of steel he was working with did not require quenching to harden\r\nit. He had it analyzed to discover the meaning of this peculiarity and\r\nlearned that it contained tungsten, a rare metal unrecognized in the\r\nmetallurgy of that day. Further investigation showed that steel to which\r\ntungsten and manganese or chromium had been added was tougher and\r\nretained its temper at high temperature better than ordinary carbon\r\nsteel. Tools made from it could be worked up to a white heat without\r\nlosing their cutting power. The new tools of this type invented by\r\n\"Efficiency\" Taylor at the Bethlehem Steel Works in the nineties have\r\nrevolutionized shop practice the world over. A tool of the old sort\r\ncould not cut at a rate faster than thirty feet a minute without\r\noverheating, but the new tungsten tools will plow through steel ten\r\ntimes as fast and can cut away a ton of the material in an hour. By\r\nmeans of these high-speed tools the United States was able to turn out\r\nfive times the munitions that it could otherwise have done in the same\r\ntime. On the other hand, if Germany alone had possessed the secret of\r\nthe modern steels no power could have withstood her. A slight\r\nsuperiority in metallurgy has been the deciding factor in many a battle.\r\nThose of my readers who have had the advantages of Sunday school\r\ntraining will recall the case described in I Samuel 13:19-22.\r\n\r\nBy means of these new metals armor plate has been made\r\ninvulnerable--except to projectiles pointed with similar material.\r\nFlying has been made possible through engines weighing no more than two\r\npounds per horse power. The cylinders of combustion engines and the\r\ncasing of cannon have been made to withstand the unprecedented pressure\r\nand corrosive action of the fiery gases evolved within. Castings are\r\nmade so hard that they cannot be cut--save with tools of the same sort.\r\nIn the high-speed tools now used 20 or 30 per cent, of the iron is\r\ndisplaced by other ingredients; for example, tungsten from 14 to 25 per\r\ncent., chromium from 2 to 7 per cent., vanadium from 1/2 to 1-1/2 per\r\ncent., carbon from 6 to 8 per cent., with perhaps cobalt up to 4 per\r\ncent. Molybdenum or uranium may replace part of the tungsten.\r\n\r\nSome of the newer alloys for high-speed tools contain no iron at all.\r\nThat which bears the poetic name of star-stone, stellite, is composed of\r\nchromium, cobalt and tungsten in varying proportions. Stellite keeps a\r\nhard cutting edge and gets tougher as it gets hotter. It is very hard\r\nand as good for jewelry as platinum except that it is not so expensive.\r\nCooperite, its rival, is an alloy of nickel and zirconium, stronger,\r\nlighter and cheaper than stellite.\r\n\r\nBefore the war nearly half of the world's supply of tungsten ore\r\n(wolframite) came from Burma. But although Burma had belonged to the\r\nBritish for a hundred years they had not developed its mineral resources\r\nand the tungsten trade was monopolized by the Germans. All the ore was\r\nshipped to Germany and the British Admiralty was content to buy from the\r\nGermans what tungsten was needed for armor plate and heavy guns. When\r\nthe war broke out the British had the ore supply, but were unable at\r\nfirst to work it because they were not familiar with the processes.\r\nGermany, being short of tungsten, had to sneak over a little from\r\nBaltimore in the submarine _Deutschland_. In the United States before\r\nthe war tungsten ore was selling at $6.50 a unit, but by the beginning\r\nof 1916 it had jumped to $85 a unit. A unit is 1 per cent. of tungsten\r\ntrioxide to the ton, that is, twenty pounds. Boulder County, Colorado,\r\nand San Bernardino, California, then had mining booms, reminding one of\r\nolder times. Between May and December, 1918, there was manufactured in\r\nthe United States more than 45,500,000 pounds of tungsten steel\r\ncontaining some 8,000,000 pounds of tungsten.\r\n\r\nIf tungsten ores were more abundant and the metal more easily\r\nmanipulated, it would displace steel for many purposes. It is harder\r\nthan steel or even quartz. It never rusts and is insoluble in acids. Its\r\nexpansion by heat is one-third that of iron. It is more than twice as\r\nheavy as iron and its melting point is twice as high. Its electrical\r\nresistance is half that of iron and its tensile strength is a third\r\ngreater than the strongest steel. It can be worked into wire .0002 of an\r\ninch in diameter, almost too thin to be seen, but as strong as copper\r\nwire ten times the size.\r\n\r\nThe tungsten wires in the electric lamps are about .03 of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and they give three times the light for the same consumption\r\nof electricity as the old carbon filament. The American manufacturers of\r\nthe tungsten bulb have very appropriately named their lamp \"Mazda\" after\r\nthe light god of the Zoroastrians. To get the tungsten into wire form\r\nwas a problem that long baffled the inventors of the world, for it was\r\ntoo refractory to be melted in mass and too brittle to be drawn. Dr.\r\nW.D. Coolidge succeeded in accomplishing the feat in 1912 by reducing\r\nthe tungstic acid by hydrogen and molding the metallic powder into a bar\r\nby pressure. This is raised to a white heat in the electric furnace,\r\ntaken out and rolled down, and the process repeated some fifty times,\r\nuntil the wire is small enough so it can be drawn at a red heat through\r\ndiamond dies of successively smaller apertures.\r\n\r\nThe German method of making the lamp filaments is to squirt a mixture of\r\ntungsten powder and thorium oxide through a perforated diamond of the\r\ndesired diameter. The filament so produced is drawn through a chamber\r\nheated to 2500° C. at a velocity of eight feet an hour, which\r\ncrystallizes the tungsten into a continuous thread.\r\n\r\nThe first metallic filament used in the electric light on a commercial\r\nscale was made of tantalum, the metal of Tantalus. In the period\r\n1905-1911 over 100,000,000 tantalus lamps were sold, but tungsten\r\ndisplaced them as soon as that metal could be drawn into wire.\r\n\r\nA recent rival of tungsten both as a filament for lamps and hardener for\r\nsteel is molybdenum. One pound of this metal will impart more resiliency\r\nto steel than three or four pounds of tungsten. The molybdenum steel,\r\nbecause it does not easily crack, is said to be serviceable for\r\narmor-piercing shells, gun linings, air-plane struts, automobile axles\r\nand propeller shafts. In combination with its rival as a\r\ntungsten-molybdenum alloy it is capable of taking the place of the\r\nintolerably expensive platinum, for it resists corrosion when used for\r\nspark plugs and tooth plugs. European steel men have taken to molybdenum\r\nmore than Americans. The salts of this metal can be used in dyeing and\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\nCalcium, magnesium and aluminum, common enough in their compounds, have\r\nonly come into use as metals since the invention of the electric\r\nfurnace. Now the photographer uses magnesium powder for his flashlight\r\nwhen he wants to take a picture of his friends inside the house, and the\r\naviator uses it when he wants to take a picture of his enemies on the\r\nopen field. The flares prepared by our Government for the war consist of\r\na sheet iron cylinder, four feet long and six inches thick, containing a\r\nstick of magnesium attached to a tightly rolled silk parachute twenty\r\nfeet in diameter when expanded. The whole weighed 32 pounds. On being\r\ndropped from the plane by pressing a button, the rush of air set\r\nspinning a pinwheel at the bottom which ignited the magnesium stick and\r\ndetonated a charge of black powder sufficient to throw off the case and\r\nrelease the parachute. The burning flare gave off a light of 320,000\r\ncandle power lasting for ten minutes as the parachute slowly descended.\r\nThis illuminated the ground on the darkest night sufficiently for the\r\nairman to aim his bombs or to take photographs.\r\n\r\nThe addition of 5 or 10 per cent. of magnesium to aluminum gives an\r\nalloy (magnalium) that is almost as light as aluminum and almost as\r\nstrong as steel. An alloy of 90 per cent. aluminum and 10 per cent.\r\ncalcium is lighter and harder than aluminum and more resistant to\r\ncorrosion. The latest German airplane, the \"Junker,\" was made entirely\r\nof duralumin. Even the wings were formed of corrugated sheets of this\r\nalloy instead of the usual doped cotton-cloth. Duralumin is composed of\r\nabout 85 per cent. of aluminum, 5 per cent. of copper, 5 per cent. of\r\nzinc and 2 per cent. of tin.\r\n\r\nWhen platinum was first discovered it was so cheap that ingots of it\r\nwere gilded and sold as gold bricks to unwary purchasers. The Russian\r\nGovernment used it as we use nickel, for making small coins. But this is\r\nan exception to the rule that the demand creates the supply. Platinum is\r\nreally a \"rare metal,\" not merely an unfamiliar one. Nowhere except in\r\nthe Urals is it found in quantity, and since it seems indispensable in\r\nchemical and electrical appliances, the price has continually gone up.\r\nRussia collapsed into chaos just when the war work made the heaviest\r\ndemand for platinum, so the governments had to put a stop to its use for\r\njewelry and photography. The \"gold brick\" scheme would now have to be\r\nreversed, for gold is used as a cheaper metal to \"adulterate\" platinum.\r\nAll the members of the platinum family, formerly ignored, were pressed\r\ninto service, palladium, rhodium, osmium, iridium, and these, alloyed\r\nwith gold or silver, were employed more or less satisfactorily by the\r\ndentist, chemist and electrician as substitutes for the platinum of\r\nwhich they had been deprived. One of these alloys, composed of 20 per\r\ncent. palladium and 80 per cent. gold, and bearing the telescoped name\r\nof \"palau\" (palladium au-rum) makes very acceptable crucibles for the\r\nlaboratory and only costs half as much as platinum. \"Rhotanium\" is a\r\nsimilar alloy recently introduced. The points of our gold pens are\r\ntipped with an osmium-iridium alloy. It is a pity that this family of\r\nnoble metals is so restricted, for they are unsurpassed in tenacity and\r\nincorruptibility. They could be of great service to the world in war and\r\npeace. As the \"Bad Child\" says in his \"Book of Beasts\":\r\n\r\n  I shoot the hippopotamus with bullets made of platinum,\r\n  Because if I use leaden ones, his hide is sure to flatten 'em.\r\n\r\nAlong in the latter half of the last century chemists had begun to\r\nperceive certain regularities and relationships among the various\r\nelements, so they conceived the idea that some sort of a pigeon-hole\r\nscheme might be devised in which the elements could be filed away in the\r\norder of their atomic weights so that one could see just how a certain\r\nelement, known or unknown, would behave from merely observing its\r\nposition in the series. Mendeléef, a Russian chemist, devised the most\r\ningenious of such systems called the \"periodic law\" and gave proof that\r\nthere was something in his theory by predicting the properties of three\r\nmetallic elements, then unknown but for which his arrangement showed\r\nthree empty pigeon-holes. Sixteen years later all three of these\r\npredicted elements had been discovered, one by a Frenchman, one by a\r\nGerman and one by a Scandinavian, and named from patriotic impulse,\r\ngallium, germanium and scandium. This was a triumph of scientific\r\nprescience as striking as the mathematical proof of the existence of the\r\nplanet Neptune by Leverrier before it had been found by the telescope.\r\n\r\nBut although Mendeléef's law told \"the truth,\" it gradually became\r\nevident that it did not tell \"the whole truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth,\" as the lawyers put it. As usually happens in the history of\r\nscience the hypothesis was found not to explain things so simply and\r\ncompletely as was at first assumed. The anomalies in the arrangement did\r\nnot disappear on closer study, but stuck out more conspicuously. Though\r\nMendeléef had pointed out three missing links, he had failed to make\r\nprovision for a whole group of elements since discovered, the inert\r\ngases of the helium-argon group. As we now know, the scheme was built\r\nupon the false assumptions that the elements are immutable and that\r\ntheir atomic weights are invariable.\r\n\r\nThe elements that the chemists had most difficulty in sorting out and\r\nidentifying were the heavy metals found in the \"rare earths.\" There were\r\nabout twenty of them so mixed up together and so much alike as to baffle\r\nall ordinary means of separating them. For a hundred years chemists\r\nworked over them and quarreled over them before they discovered that\r\nthey had a commercial value. It was a problem as remote from\r\npracticality as any that could be conceived. The man in the street did\r\nnot see why chemists should care whether there were two didymiums any\r\nmore than why theologians should care whether there were two Isaiahs.\r\nBut all of a sudden, in 1885, the chemical puzzle became a business\r\nproposition. The rare earths became household utensils and it made a big\r\ndifference with our monthly gas bills whether the ceria and the thoria\r\nin the burner mantles were absolutely pure or contained traces of some\r\nof the other elements that were so difficult to separate.\r\n\r\nThis sudden change of venue from pure to applied science came about\r\nthrough a Viennese chemist, Dr. Carl Auer, later and in consequence\r\nknown as Baron Auer von Welsbach. He was trying to sort out the rare\r\nearths by means of the spectroscopic method, which consists ordinarily\r\nin dipping a platinum wire into a solution of the unknown substance and\r\nholding it in a colorless gas flame. As it burns off, each element gives\r\na characteristic color to the flame, which is seen as a series of lines\r\nwhen looked at through the spectroscope. But the flash of the flame from\r\nthe platinum wire was too brief to be studied, so Dr. Auer hit upon the\r\nplan of soaking a thread in the liquid and putting this in the gas jet.\r\nThe cotton of course burned off at once, but the earths held together\r\nand when heated gave off a brilliant white light, very much like the\r\ncalcium or limelight which is produced by heating a stick of quicklime\r\nin the oxy-hydrogen flame. But these rare earths do not require any such\r\nintense heat as that, for they will glow in an ordinary gas jet.\r\n\r\nSo the Welsbach mantle burner came into use everywhere and rescued the\r\ncoal gas business from the destruction threatened by the electric light.\r\nIt was no longer necessary to enrich the gas with oil to make its flame\r\nluminous, for a cheaper fuel gas such as is used for a gas stove will\r\ngive, with a mantle, a fine white light of much higher candle power than\r\nthe ordinary gas jet. The mantles are knit in narrow cylinders on\r\nmachines, cut off at suitable lengths, soaked in a solution of the salts\r\nof the rare earths and dried. Artificial silk (viscose) has been found\r\nbetter than cotton thread for the mantles, for it is solid, not hollow,\r\nmore uniform in quality and continuous instead of being broken up into\r\none-inch fibers. There is a great deal of difference in the quality of\r\nthese mantles, as every one who has used them knows. Some that give a\r\nbright glow at first with the gas-cock only half open will soon break up\r\nor grow dull and require more gas to get any kind of a light out of\r\nthem. Others will last long and grow better to the last. Slight\r\nimpurities in the earths or the gas will speedily spoil the light. The\r\nbest results are obtained from a mixture of 99 parts thoria and 1 part\r\nceria. It is the ceria that gives the light, yet a little more of it\r\nwill lower the luminosity.\r\n\r\nThe non-chemical reader is apt to be confused by the strange names and\r\ntheir varied terminations, but he need not be when he learns that the\r\nnew metals are given names ending in _-um_, such as sodium, cerium,\r\nthorium, and that their oxides (compounds with oxygen, the earths) are\r\ngiven the termination _-a_, like soda, ceria, thoria. So when he sees a\r\nname ending in _-um_ let him picture to himself a metal, any metal since\r\nthey mostly look alike, lead or silver, for example. And when he comes\r\nacross a name ending in _-a_ he may imagine a white powder like lime.\r\nThorium, for instance, is, as its name implies, a metal named after the\r\nthunder god Thor, to whom we dedicate one day in each week, Thursday.\r\nCerium gets its name from the Roman goddess of agriculture by way of the\r\nasteroid.\r\n\r\nThe chief sources of the material for the Welsbach burners is monazite,\r\na glittering yellow sand composed of phosphate of cerium with some 5 per\r\ncent. of thorium. In 1916 the United States imported 2,500,000 pounds of\r\nmonazite from Brazil and India, most of which used to go to Germany. In\r\n1895 we got over a million and a half pounds from the Carolinas, but the\r\nforeign sand is richer and cheaper. The price of the salts of the rare\r\nmetals fluctuates wildly. In 1895 thorium nitrate sold at $200 a pound;\r\nin 1913 it fell to $2.60, and in 1916 it rose to $8.\r\n\r\nSince the monazite contains more cerium than thorium and the mantles\r\nmade from it contain more thorium than cerium, there is a superfluity of\r\ncerium. The manufacturers give away a pound of cerium salts with every\r\npurchase of a hundred pounds of thorium salts. It annoyed Welsbach to\r\nsee the cerium residues thrown away and accumulating around his mantle\r\nfactory, so he set out to find some use for it. He reduced the mixed\r\nearths to a metallic form and found that it gave off a shower of sparks\r\nwhen scratched. An alloy of cerium with 30 or 35 per cent. of iron\r\nproved the best and was put on the market in the form of automatic\r\nlighters. A big business was soon built up in Austria on the basis of\r\nthis obscure chemical element rescued from the dump-heap. The sale of\r\nthe cerite lighters in France threatened to upset the finances of the\r\nrepublic, which derived large revenue from its monopoly of match-making,\r\nso the French Government imposed a tax upon every man who carried one.\r\nAmerican tourists who bought these lighters in Germany used to be much\r\nannoyed at being held up on the French frontier and compelled to take\r\nout a license. During the war the cerium sparklers were much used in the\r\ntrenches for lighting cigarettes, but--as those who have seen \"The\r\nBetter 'Ole\" will know--they sometimes fail to strike fire. Auer-metal\r\nor cerium-iron alloy was used in munitions to ignite hand grenades and\r\nto blazon the flight of trailer shells. There are many other pyrophoric\r\n(light-producing) alloys, including steel, which our ancestors used with\r\nflint before matches and percussion caps were invented.\r\n\r\nThere are more than fifty metals known and not half of them have come\r\ninto common use, so there is still plenty of room for the expansion of\r\nthe science of metallurgy. If the reader has not forgotten his\r\narithmetic of permutations he can calculate how many different alloys\r\nmay be formed by varying the combinations and proportions of these\r\nfifty. We have seen how quickly elements formerly known only to\r\nchemists--and to some of them known only by name--have become\r\nindispensable in our daily life. Any one of those still unutilized may\r\nbe found to have peculiar properties that fit it for filling a long\r\nunfelt want in modern civilization.\r\n\r\nWho, for instance, will find a use for gallium, the metal of France? It\r\nwas described in 1869 by Mendeléef in advance of its advent and has been\r\nknown in person since 1875, but has not yet been set to work. It is\r\nsuch a remarkable metal that it must be good for something. If you saw\r\nit in a museum case on a cold day you might take it to be a piece of\r\naluminum, but if the curator let you hold it in your hand--which he\r\nwon't--it would melt and run over the floor like mercury. The melting\r\npoint is 87° Fahr. It might be used in thermometers for measuring\r\ntemperatures above the boiling point of mercury were it not for the\r\npeculiar fact that gallium wets glass so it sticks to the side of the\r\ntube instead of forming a clear convex curve on top like mercury.\r\n\r\nThen there is columbium, the American metal. It is strange that an\r\nelement named after Columbia should prove so impractical. Columbium is a\r\nmetal closely resembling tantalum and tantalum found a use as electric\r\nlight filaments. A columbium lamp should appeal to our patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"rare elements\" are really abundant enough considering the\r\nearth's crust as a whole, though they are so thinly scattered that they\r\nare usually overlooked and hard to extract. But whenever one of them is\r\nfound valuable it is soon found available. A systematic search generally\r\nreveals it somewhere in sufficient quantity to be worked. Who, then,\r\nwill be the first to discover a use for indium, germanium, terbium,\r\nthulium, lanthanum, neodymium, scandium, samarium and others as unknown\r\nto us as tungsten was to our fathers?\r\n\r\nAs evidence of the statement that it does not matter how rare an element\r\nmay be it will come into common use if it is found to be commonly\r\nuseful, we may refer to radium. A good rich specimen of radium ore,\r\npitchblende, may contain as much, as one part in 4,000,000. Madame\r\nCurie, the brilliant Polish Parisian, had to work for years before she\r\ncould prove to the world that such an element existed and for years\r\nafterwards before she could get the metal out. Yet now we can all afford\r\na bit of radium to light up our watch dials in the dark. The amount\r\nneeded for this is infinitesimal. If it were more it would scorch our\r\nskins, for radium is an element in eruption. The atom throws off\r\ncorpuscles at intervals as a Roman candle throws off blazing balls. Some\r\nof these particles, the alpha rays, are atoms of another element,\r\nhelium, charged with positive electricity and are ejected with a\r\nvelocity of 18,000 miles a second. Some of them, the beta rays, are\r\nnegative electrons, only about one seven-thousandth the size of the\r\nothers, but are ejected with almost the speed of light, 186,000 miles a\r\nsecond. If one of the alpha projectiles strikes a slice of zinc sulfide\r\nit makes a splash of light big enough to be seen with a microscope, so\r\nwe can now follow the flight of a single atom. The luminous watch dials\r\nconsist of a coating of zinc sulfide under continual bombardment by the\r\nradium projectiles. Sir William Crookes invented this radium light\r\napparatus and called it a \"spinthariscope,\" which is Greek for\r\n\"spark-seer.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently if radium is so wasteful of its substance it cannot last\r\nforever nor could it have forever existed. The elements then ate not\r\nnecessarily eternal and immutable, as used to be supposed. They have a\r\nnatural length of life; they are born and die and propagate, at least\r\nsome of them do. Radium, for instance, is the offspring of ionium,\r\nwhich is the great-great-grandson of uranium, the heaviest of known\r\nelements. Putting this chemical genealogy into biblical language we\r\nmight say: Uranium lived 5,000,000,000 years and begot Uranium X1, which\r\nlived 24.6 days and begot Uranium X2, which lived 69 seconds and begot\r\nUranium 2, which lived 2,000,000 years and begot Ionium, which lived\r\n200,000 years and begot Radium, which lived 1850 years and begot Niton,\r\nwhich lived 3.85 days and begot Radium A, which lived 3 minutes and\r\nbegot Radium B, which lived 26.8 minutes and begot Radium C, which lived\r\n19.5 minutes and begot Radium D, which lived 12 years and begot Radium\r\nE, which lived 5 days and begot Polonium, which lived 136 days and begot\r\nLead.\r\n\r\nThe figures I have given are the times when half the parent substance\r\nhas gone over into the next generation. It will be seen that the chemist\r\nis even more liberal in his allowance of longevity than was Moses with\r\nthe patriarchs. It appears from the above that half of the radium in any\r\ngiven specimen will be transformed in about 2000 years. Half of what is\r\nleft will disappear in the next 2000 years, half of that in the next\r\n2000 and so on. The reader can figure out for himself when it will all\r\nbe gone. He will then have the answer to the old Eleatic conundrum of\r\nwhen Achilles will overtake the tortoise. But we may say that after\r\n100,000 years there would not be left any radium worth mentioning, or in\r\nother words practically all the radium now in existence is younger than\r\nthe human race. The lead that is found in uranium and has presumably\r\ndescended from uranium, behaves like other lead but is lighter. Its\r\natomic weight is only 206, while ordinary lead weighs 207. It appears\r\nthen that the same chemical element may have different atomic weights\r\naccording to its ancestry, while on the other hand different chemical\r\nelements may have the same atomic weight. This would have seemed\r\nshocking heresy to the chemists of the last century, who prided\r\nthemselves on the immutability of the elements and did not take into\r\nconsideration their past life or heredity. The study of these\r\nradioactive elements has led to a new atomic theory. I suppose most of\r\nus in our youth used to imagine the atom as a little round hard ball,\r\nbut now it is conceived as a sort of solar system with an\r\nelectropositive nucleus acting as the sun and negative electrons\r\nrevolving around it like the planets. The number of free positive\r\nelectrons in the nucleus varies from one in hydrogen to 92 in uranium.\r\nThis leaves room for 92 possible elements and of these all but six are\r\nmore or less certainly known and definitely placed in the scheme. The\r\natom of uranium, weighing 238 times the atom of hydrogen, is the\r\nheaviest known and therefore the ultimate limit of the elements, though\r\nit is possible that elements may be found beyond it just as the planet\r\nNeptune was discovered outside the orbit of Uranus. Considering the\r\nposition of uranium and its numerous progeny as mentioned above, it is\r\nquite appropriate that this element should bear the name of the father\r\nof all the gods.\r\n\r\nIn these radioactive elements we have come upon sources of energy such\r\nas was never dreamed of in our philosophy. The most striking peculiarity\r\nof radium is that it is always a little warmer than its surroundings, no\r\nmatter how warm these may be. Slowly, spontaneously and continuously,\r\nit decomposes and we know no way of hastening or of checking it. Whether\r\nit is cooled in liquefied air or heated to its melting point the change\r\ngoes on just the same. An ounce of radium salt will give out enough heat\r\nin one hour to melt an ounce of ice and in the next hour will raise this\r\nwater to the boiling point, and so on again and again without cessation\r\nfor years, a fire without fuel, a realization of the philosopher's lamp\r\nthat the alchemists sought in vain. The total energy so emitted is\r\nmillions of times greater than that produced by any chemical combination\r\nsuch as the union of oxygen and hydrogen to form water. From the heavy\r\nwhite salt there is continually rising a faint fire-mist like the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp over a swamp. This gas is known as the emanation or\r\nniton, \"the shining one.\" A pound of niton would give off energy at the\r\nrate of 23,000 horsepower; fine stuff to run a steamer, one would think,\r\nbut we must remember that it does not last. By the sixth day the power\r\nwould have fallen off by half. Besides, no one would dare to serve as\r\nengineer, for the radiation will rot away the flesh of a living man who\r\ncomes near it, causing gnawing ulcers or curing them. It will not only\r\nbreak down the complex and delicate molecules of organic matter but will\r\nattack the atom itself, changing, it is believed, one element into\r\nanother, again the fulfilment of a dream of the alchemists. And its\r\nrays, unseen and unfelt by us, are yet strong enough to penetrate an\r\narmorplate and photograph what is behind it.\r\n\r\nBut radium is not the most mysterious of the elements but the least so.\r\nIt is giving out the secret that the other elements have kept. It\r\nsuggests to us that all the other elements in proportion to their weight\r\nhave concealed within them similar stores of energy. Astronomers have\r\nlong dazzled our imaginations by calculating the horsepower of the\r\nworld, making us feel cheap in talking about our steam engines and\r\ndynamos when a minutest fraction of the waste dynamic energy of the\r\nsolar system would make us all as rich as millionaires. But the heavenly\r\nbodies are too big for us to utilize in this practical fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd now the chemists have become as exasperating as the astronomers, for\r\nthey give us a glimpse of incalculable wealth in the meanest substance.\r\nFor wealth is measured by the available energy of the world, and if a\r\nfew ounces of anything would drive an engine or manufacture nitrogenous\r\nfertilizer from the air all our troubles would be over. Kipling in his\r\nsketch, \"With the Night Mail,\" and Wells in his novel, \"The World Set\r\nFree,\" stretched their imaginations in trying to tell us what it would\r\nmean to have command of this power, but they are a little hazy in their\r\ndescriptions of the machinery by which it is utilized. The atom is as\r\nmuch beyond our reach as the moon. We cannot rob its vault of the\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING REFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing pages will not have achieved their aim unless their\r\nreaders have become sufficiently interested in the developments of\r\nindustrial chemistry to desire to pursue the subject further in some of\r\nits branches. Assuming such interest has been aroused, I am giving below\r\na few references to books and articles which may serve to set the reader\r\nupon the right track for additional information. To follow the rapid\r\nprogress of applied science it is necessary to read continuously such\r\nperiodicals as the _Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_\r\n(New York), _Metallurgical and Chemical Engineering_ (New York),\r\n_Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry_ (London), _Chemical\r\nAbstracts_ (published by the American Chemical Society, Easton, Pa.),\r\nand the various journals devoted to special trades. The reader may need\r\nto be reminded that the United States Government publishes for free\r\ndistribution or at low price annual volumes or special reports dealing\r\nwith science and industry. Among these may be mentioned \"Yearbook of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture\"; \"Mineral Resources of the United States,\"\r\npublished by the United States Geological Survey in two annual volumes,\r\nVol. I on the metals and Vol. II on the non-metals; the \"Annual Report\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution,\" containing selected articles on pure\r\nand applied science; the daily \"Commerce Reports\" and special bulletins\r\nof Department of Commerce. Write for lists of publications of these\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe following books on industrial chemistry in general are recommended\r\nfor reading and reference: \"The Chemistry of Commerce\" and \"Some\r\nChemical Problems of To-Day\" by Robert Kennedy Duncan (Harpers, N.Y.),\r\n\"Modern Chemistry and Its Wonders\" by Martin (Van Nostrand), \"Chemical\r\nDiscovery and Invention in the Twentieth Century\" by Sir William A.\r\nTilden (Dutton, N.Y.), \"Discoveries and Inventions of the Twentieth\r\nCentury\" by Edward Cressy (Dutton), \"Industrial Chemistry\" by Allen\r\nRogers (Van Nostrand).\r\n\r\n\"Everyman's Chemistry\" by Ellwood Hendrick (Harpers, Modern Science\r\nSeries) is written in a lively style and assumes no previous knowledge\r\nof chemistry from the reader. The chapters on cellulose, gums, sugars\r\nand oils are particularly interesting. \"Chemistry of Familiar Things\" by\r\nS.S. Sadtler (Lippincott) is both comprehensive and comprehensible.\r\n\r\nThe following are intended for young readers but are not to be despised\r\nby their elders who may wish to start in on an easy up-grade: \"Chemistry\r\nof Common Things\" (Allyn & Bacon, Boston) is a popular high school\r\ntext-book but differing from most text-books in being readable and\r\nattractive. Its descriptions of industrial processes are brief but\r\nclear. The \"Achievements of Chemical Science\" by James C. Philip\r\n(Macmillan) is a handy little book, easy reading for pupils.\r\n\"Introduction to the Study of Science\" by W.P. Smith and E.G. Jewett\r\n(Macmillan) touches upon chemical topics in a simple way.\r\n\r\nOn the history of commerce and the effect of inventions on society the\r\nfollowing titles may be suggested: \"Outlines of Industrial History\" by\r\nE. Cressy (Macmillan); \"The Origin of Invention,\" a study of primitive\r\nindustry, by O.T. Mason (Scribner); \"The Romance of Commerce\" by Gordon\r\nSelbridge (Lane); \"Industrial and Commercial Geography\" or \"Commerce and\r\nIndustry\" by J. Russell Smith (Holt); \"Handbook of Commercial Geography\"\r\nby G.G. Chisholm (Longmans).\r\n\r\nThe newer theories of chemistry and the constitution of the atom are\r\nexplained in \"The Realities of Modern Science\" by John Mills\r\n(Macmillan), and \"The Electron\" by R.A. Millikan (University of Chicago\r\nPress), but both require a knowledge of mathematics. The little book on\r\n\"Matter and Energy\" by Frederick Soddy (Holt) is better adapted to the\r\ngeneral reader. The most recent text-book is the \"Introduction to\r\nGeneral Chemistry\" by H.N. McCoy and E.M. Terry. (Chicago, 1919.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe reader who may be interested in following up this subject will find\r\nreferences to all the literature in the summary by Helen R. Hosmer, of\r\nthe Research Laboratory of the General Electric Company, in the _Journal\r\nof Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_, New York, for April, 1917.\r\nBucher's paper may be found in the same journal for March, and the issue\r\nfor September contains a full report of the action of U.S. Government\r\nand a comparison of the various processes. Send fifteen cents to the\r\nU.S. Department of Commerce (or to the nearest custom house) for\r\nBulletin No. 52, Special Agents Series on \"Utilization of Atmospheric\r\nNitrogen\" by T.H. Norton. The Smithsonian Institution of Washington has\r\nissued a pamphlet on \"Sources of Nitrogen Compounds in the United\r\nStates.\" In the 1913 report of the Smithsonian Institution there are two\r\nfine articles on this subject: \"The Manufacture of Nitrates from the\r\nAtmosphere\" and \"The Distribution of Mankind,\" which discusses Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes' prediction of the exhaustion of wheat land. The D. Van\r\nNostrand Co., New York, publishes a monograph on \"Fixation of\r\nAtmospheric Nitrogen\" by J. Knox, also \"TNT and Other Nitrotoluenes\" by\r\nG.C. Smith. The American Cyanamid Company, New York, gives out some\r\nattractive literature on their process.\r\n\r\n\"American Munitions 1917-1918,\" the report of Benedict Crowell, Director\r\nof Munitions, to the Secretary of War, gives a fully illustrated\r\naccount of the manufacture of arms, explosives and toxic gases. Our war\r\nexperience in the \"Oxidation of Ammonia\" is told by C.L. Parsons in\r\n_Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_, June, 1919, and\r\nvarious other articles on the government munition work appeared in the\r\nsame journal in the first half of 1919. \"The Muscle Shoals Nitrate\r\nPlant\" in _Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering_, January, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture or your congressman will send you\r\nliterature on the production and use of fertilizers.

Also\r\nconsult the latest Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture. For\r\nself-instruction, problems and experiments get \"Extension Course in\r\nSoils,\" Bulletin No. 355, U.S. Dept. of Agric. A list of all government\r\npublications on \"Soil and Fertilizers\" is sent free by Superintendent of\r\nDocuments, Washington. The _Journal of Industrial and Engineering\r\nChemistry_ for July, 1917, publishes an article by W.C. Ebaugh on\r\n\"Potash and a World Emergency,\" and various articles on American sources\r\nof potash appeared in the same _Journal_ October, 1918, and February,\r\n1918. Bulletin 102, Part 2, of the United States National Museum\r\ncontains an interpretation of the fertilizer situation in 1917 by J.E.\r\nPoque. On new potash deposits in Alsace and elsewhere see _Scientific\r\nAmerican Supplement_, September 14, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSend ten cents to the Department of Commerce, Washington, for \"Dyestuffs\r\nfor American Textile and Other Industries,\" by Thomas H.

XXIII, I, p. 1306.\r\nI have quoted it with some other instances of dream discoveries in _The\r\nIndependent_ of Jan. 26, 1918. Even this innocent scientific vision has\r\nnot escaped the foul touch of the Freudians. Dr. Alfred Robitsek in\r\n\"Symbolisches Denken in der chemischen Forschung,\" _Imago_, V. I, p. 83,\r\nhas deduced from it that Kekulé was morally guilty of the crime of\r\nOEdipus as well as minor misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRead up on the methods of extracting perfumes from flowers in any\r\nencyclopedia or in Duncan's \"Chemistry of Commerce\" or Tilden's\r\n\"Chemical Discovery in the Twentieth Century\" or Rogers' \"Industrial\r\nChemistry.\"\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet containing a synopsis of the lectures by the late Alois von\r\nIsakovics on \"Synthetic Perfumes and Flavors,\" published by the Synfleur\r\nScientific Laboratories, Monticello, New York, is immensely interesting.\r\nVan Dyk & Co., New York, issue a pamphlet on the composition of oil of\r\nrose. Gildemeister's \"The Volatile Oils\" is excellent on the history of\r\nthe subject. Walter's \"Manual for the Essence Industry\" (Wiley) gives\r\nmethods and recipes.

SLOSSON\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Creative Chemistry,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Slosson is nothing short of a prodigy. He is a triple-starred\r\nscientist man who can bring down the highest flying scientific fact and\r\ntame it so that any of us can live with it and sometimes even love it.\r\nHe can make a fairy tale out of coal-tar dyes and a laboratory into a\r\njoyful playhouse while it continues functioning gloriously as a\r\nlaboratory. But to readers of \"Creative Chemistry\" it is wasting time to\r\ntalk about Dr. Slosson's style.\r\n\r\n\"Chats On Science,\" which has just been published, is made up of\r\neighty-five brief chapters or sections or periods, each complete in\r\nitself, dealing with a gorgeous variety of subjects. They go from\r\nPopover Stars to Soda Water, from How Old Is Disease to Einstein in\r\nWords of One Syllable. The reader can begin anywhere, but when he begins\r\nhe will ultimately read the entire series. It is good science and good\r\nreading. It contains some of the best writing Dr. Slosson has ever done.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Transcript says: \"These 'Chats' are even more fascinating,\r\nwere that possible, than 'Creative Chemistry.' They are more marvelous\r\nthan the most marvelous of fairy tales ... Even an adequate review could\r\ngive little idea of the treasures of modern scientific knowledge 'Chats\r\non Science' contains ... Dr. Slosson has, besides rare scientific\r\nknowledge, that gift of the gods--imagination.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(\"Chats on Science\" by E.E. Slosson is published by The Century Company,\r\n353 Fourth Avenue, New York City. It is sold for $2.00 at all\r\nbookstores, or it may be ordered from the publisher.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I am quoting mostly Unstead's figures from the _Geographical\r\nJournal_ of 1913.
