Since the neutron has a mass number of 1 and an atomic number\r\nof 0 (because it is uncharged), a nucleus that absorbs a neutron remains\r\nan isotope of the same element, but increases its mass number.\r\n\r\nFor instance, suppose that neutrons are used to bombard hydrogen-1,\r\nwhich then captures one of the neutrons. From a single proton, it will\r\nbecome a proton plus a neutron; from hydrogen-1, it will become\r\nhydrogen-2. A new nucleus formed in this way will be at a higher energy\r\nand that energy is emitted in the form of a gamma ray.\r\n\r\nSometimes the more massive isotope that is formed through neutron\r\nabsorption is stable, as hydrogen-2 is. Sometimes it is not, but is\r\nradioactive instead. Because it has added a neutron, it has too many\r\nneutrons for stability. The best way of adjusting the matter is to emit\r\na beta particle (electron). This converts one of the neutrons into a\r\nproton. The mass number stays the same but the atomic number increases\r\nby one.\r\n\r\nThe element rhodium, for example, which has an atomic number of 45, has\r\nonly 1 stable isotope, with a mass number of 103. If rhodium-103 (45\r\nprotons, 58 neutrons) absorbs a neutron, it becomes rhodium-104 (45\r\nprotons, 59 neutrons), which is not stable. Rhodium-104 emits a beta\r\nparticle, changing a neutron to a proton so that the nuclear combination\r\nbecomes 46 protons and 58 neutrons. This is palladium-104, which is\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fermi’s laboratory in Rome in 1930._]\r\n\r\nAs another example, indium-115 (49 protons, 66 neutrons) absorbs a\r\nneutron and becomes indium-116 (49 protons, 67 neutrons), which gives\r\noff a beta particle and becomes tin-116 (50 protons, 66 neutrons), which\r\nis stable.\r\n\r\nThere are over 100 isotopes that will absorb neutrons and end by\r\nbecoming an isotope of an element one higher in the atomic number scale.\r\nFermi observed a number of these cases.\r\n\r\nHaving done so, he was bound to ask what would happen if uranium were\r\nbombarded with neutrons. Would its isotopes also be raised in atomic\r\nnumber—in this case from 92 to 93? If that were so it would be very\r\nexciting, for uranium had the highest atomic number in the entire scale.\r\nNobody had ever discovered any sample of element number 93, but perhaps\r\nit could be formed in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn 1934, therefore, Fermi bombarded uranium with neutrons in the hope of\r\nobtaining atoms of element 93. Neutrons were absorbed and whatever was\r\nformed did give off beta particles, so element 93 should be there.\r\nHowever, four different kinds of beta particles (different in their\r\nenergy content) were given off and the matter grew very confusing. Fermi\r\ncould not definitely identify the presence of atoms of element 93 and\r\nneither could anyone else for several years. Other things turned up,\r\nhowever, which were even more significant.\r\n\r\nBefore going on to these other things, however, it should be mentioned\r\nthat undoubtedly element 93 was formed even though Fermi couldn’t\r\nclearly demonstrate the fact. In 1939 the American physicists Edwin\r\nMattison McMillan (1907-    ) and Philip Hauge Abelson (1913-    ),\r\nafter bombarding uranium atoms with slow neutrons, were able to identify\r\nelement 93. Since uranium had originally been named for the planet,\r\nUranus, the new element beyond uranium was eventually named for the\r\nplanet Neptune, which lay beyond Uranus. Element 93 is therefore called\r\n“neptunium”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lise Meitner_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Emilio Segrè_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Edwin M. McMillan_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Otto R. Frisch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Glenn T. Seaborg_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Philip H. Abelson_]\r\n\r\nWhat happened was exactly what was expected. Uranium-238 (92 protons,\r\n146 neutrons) added a neutron to become uranium-239 (92 protons, 147\r\nneutrons), which emitted a beta particle to become neptunium-239 (93\r\nprotons, 146 neutrons).\r\n\r\nIn fact, neptunium-239 also emitted a beta particle so it ought to\r\nbecome an isotope of an element even higher in the atomic number scale.\r\nThis one, element 94, was named “plutonium” after Pluto, the planet\r\nbeyond Neptune. The isotope, plutonium-239, formed from neptunium-239,\r\nwas only feebly radioactive, however, and it was not clearly identified\r\nuntil 1941.\r\n\r\nThe actual discovery of the element plutonium came the year before,\r\nhowever, when neptunium-238 was formed. It emitted a beta particle and\r\nbecame plutonium-238, an isotope that was radioactive enough to be\r\neasily detected and identified by Glenn Theodore Seaborg (1912-    ),\r\nand his co-workers, who completed McMillan’s experiments when he was\r\ncalled away to other defense research.\r\n\r\nNeptunium and plutonium were the first “transuranium elements” to be\r\nproduced in the laboratory, but they weren’t the last. Over the next 30\r\nyears, isotopes were formed that contained more and more protons in the\r\nnucleus and therefore had higher and higher atomic numbers. At the\r\nmoment of writing, isotopes of every element up to and including element\r\n105 have been formed.\r\n\r\nA number of these new elements have been named for some of the\r\nscientists important in the history of nuclear research. Element 96 is\r\n“curium”, named for Pierre and Marie Curie; element 99 is “einsteinium”\r\nfor Albert Einstein; and element 100 is “fermium” for Enrico Fermi.\r\n\r\nElement 101 is “mendelevium” for the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeléev,\r\nwho early in 1869 was the first to arrange the elements in a reasonable\r\nand useful order. Element 103 is “lawrencium” for Ernest O. Lawrence.\r\n“Rutherfordium” for Ernest Rutherford has been proposed for element 104.\r\n\r\nAnd “hahnium” for Otto Hahn (1879-1968), a German physical chemist whose\r\ncontribution we will come to shortly, has been proposed for element 105.\r\n\r\nNeptunium, however, was not the first new element to be created in the\r\nlaboratory. In the early 1930s, there were still 2 elements with fairly\r\nlow atomic numbers that had never been discovered. These were the\r\nelements with atomic numbers 43 and 61.\r\n\r\nIn 1937, though, molybdenum (atomic number 42) had been bombarded with\r\nneutrons in Lawrence’s laboratory in the United States. It might contain\r\nsmall quantities of element 43 as a result. The Italian physicist Emilio\r\nSegrè (1905-    ), who had worked with Fermi, obtained a sample of the\r\nbombarded molybdenum and indeed obtained indications of the presence of\r\nelement 43. It was the first new element to be manufactured by\r\nartificial means and was called “technetium” from the Greek word for\r\n“artificial”.\r\n\r\nThe technetium isotope that was formed was radioactive. Indeed, all the\r\ntechnetium isotopes are radioactive. Element 61, discovered in 1945 and\r\nnamed “promethium”, also has no stable isotopes. Technetium and\r\npromethium are the only elements with atomic numbers less than 84 that\r\ndo not have even a single stable isotope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of Fission\r\n\r\nBut let us get back to the bombardment of uranium with neutrons research\r\nthat Fermi had begun. After he had reported his work, other physicists\r\nrepeated it and also got a variety of beta particles and were also\r\nunable to decide what was going on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in their laboratory in the\r\n1930s._]\r\n\r\nOne way to tackle the problem was to add to the system some stable\r\nelement that was chemically similar to the tiny traces of radioactive\r\nisotopes that might be produced through the bombardment of uranium.\r\nAfterwards the stable element could probably be separated out of the\r\nmixture and the trace of radioactivity would, it was hoped, be carried\r\nalong with it. The stable element would be a “carrier”.\r\n\r\nAmong those working on the problem were Otto Hahn and his Austrian\r\nco-worker, the physicist Lise Meitner (1878-1968). Among the potential\r\ncarriers they added to the system was the element, barium, which has an\r\natomic number of 56. They found that a considerable quantity of the\r\nradioactivity did indeed accompany the barium when they separated that\r\nelement out of the system.\r\n\r\nA natural conclusion was that the isotopes producing the radioactivity\r\nbelonged to an element that was chemically very similar to barium.\r\nSuspicion fell at once on radium (atomic number 88), which was very like\r\nbarium indeed as far as chemical properties were concerned.\r\n\r\nLise Meitner, who was Jewish, found it difficult to work in Germany,\r\nhowever, for it was then under the rule of the strongly anti-Semitic\r\nNazi regime. In March 1938 Germany occupied Austria, which became part\r\nof the German realm. Meitner was no longer protected by her Austrian\r\ncitizenship and had to flee the country and go to Stockholm, Sweden.\r\nHahn remained in Germany and continued working on the problem with the\r\nGerman physical chemist Fritz Strassman (1902-    ).\r\n\r\nAlthough the supposed radium, which possessed the radioactivity, was\r\nvery like barium in chemical properties, the two were not entirely\r\nidentical. There were ways of separating them, and Hahn and Strassman\r\nbusied themselves in trying to accomplish this in order to isolate the\r\nradioactive isotopes, concentrate them, and study them in detail. Over\r\nand over again, however, they failed to separate the barium and the\r\nsupposed radium.\r\n\r\nSlowly, it began to seem to Hahn that the failure to separate the barium\r\nand the radioactivity meant that the isotopes to which the radioactivity\r\nbelonged had to be so much like barium as to be nothing else _but_\r\nbarium. He hesitated to say so, however, because it seemed unbelievable.\r\n\r\nIf the radioactive isotopes included radium, that was conceivable.\r\nRadium had an atomic number of 88, only four less than uranium’s 92. You\r\ncould imagine that a neutron being absorbed by a uranium nucleus might\r\nmake the latter so unstable as to cause it to emit 2 alpha particles and\r\nbecome radium. Barium, however, had an atomic number of 56, only a\r\nlittle over half that of uranium. How could a uranium nucleus be made to\r\nturn into a barium nucleus unless it more or less broke in half? Nothing\r\nlike that had ever been observed before and Hahn hesitated to suggest\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhile he was nerving himself to do so, however, Lise Meitner, in\r\nStockholm, receiving reports of what was being done in Hahn’s laboratory\r\nand thinking about it, decided that unheard-of or not, there was only\r\none explanation. The uranium nucleus _was_ breaking in half.\r\n\r\nActually, when one stopped to think of it (after getting over the\r\ninitial shock) it wasn’t so unbelievable at that. The nuclear force is\r\nso short-range, it barely reaches from end to end of a large nucleus\r\nlike that of uranium. Left to itself, it holds together most of the\r\ntime, but with the added energy of an entering neutron, we might imagine\r\nshock waves going through it and turning the nucleus into something like\r\na quivering drop of liquid. Sometimes the uranium nucleus recovers,\r\nkeeps the neutron, and then goes on to beta-particle emission. And\r\nsometimes the nucleus stretches to the point where the nuclear force\r\ndoesn’t quite hold it together. It becomes a dumbbell shape and then the\r\nelectromagnetic repulsion of the two halves (both positively charged)\r\nbreaks it apart altogether.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t break into equal halves. Nor does it always break at exactly\r\nthe same place, so that there were a number of different fragments\r\npossible (which was why there was so much confusion). Still, one of the\r\nmore common ways in which it might break would be into barium and\r\nkrypton. (Their respective atomic numbers, 56 and 36, would add up to\r\n92.)\r\n\r\nMeitner and her nephew, Otto Robert Frisch (1904-    ), who was in\r\nCopenhagen, Denmark, prepared a paper suggesting that this was what was\r\nhappening. It was published in January 1939. Frisch passed it on to the\r\nDanish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) with whom he was working. The\r\nAmerican biologist William Archibald Arnold (1904-    ), who was also\r\nworking in Copenhagen at the time, suggested that the splitting of the\r\nuranium nucleus into halves be called “fission”, the term used for the\r\ndivision-in-two of living cells. The name stuck.\r\n\r\nIn January 1939, just about the time Meitner and Frisch’s paper was\r\npublished, Bohr had arrived in the United States to attend a conference\r\nof physicists. He carried the news of fission with him. The other\r\nphysicists attending the conference heard the news and in a high state\r\nof excitement at once set about studying the problem. Within a matter of\r\nweeks, the fact of uranium fission was confirmed over and over.\r\n\r\nOne striking fact about uranium fission was the large amount of energy\r\nit released. In general, when a very massive nucleus is converted to a\r\nless massive one, energy is released because of the change in the mass\r\ndefect, as Aston had shown in the 1920s. When the uranium nucleus breaks\r\ndown through the ordinary radioactive processes to become a less massive\r\nlead nucleus, energy is given off accordingly. When, however, it breaks\r\nin two to become the much less massive nuclei of barium and krypton (or\r\nothers in that neighborhood) much more energy is given off.\r\n\r\nIt quickly turned out that uranium fission gave off something like ten\r\ntimes as much nuclear energy per nucleus than did any other nuclear\r\nreaction known at the time.\r\n\r\nEven so, the quantity of energy released by uranium fission was only a\r\ntiny fraction of the energy that went into the preparation of the\r\nneutrons used to bring about the fission, if each neutron that struck a\r\nuranium atom brought about a single fission of that 1 atom.\r\n\r\nUnder those conditions, Rutherford’s suspicion that mankind would never\r\nbe able to tap nuclear energy probably still remained true. (He had been\r\ndead for 2 years at the time of the discovery of fission.)\r\n\r\nHowever, those were not the conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nuclear Chain Reaction\r\n\r\nEarlier in this history, we discussed chain reactions involving chemical\r\nenergy. A small bit of energy can ignite a chemical reaction that would\r\nproduce more than enough energy to ignite a neighboring section of the\r\nsystem, which would in turn produce still more—and so on, and so on. In\r\nthis way the flame of a single match could start a fire in a leaf that\r\nwould burn down an entire forest, and the energy given off by the\r\nburning forest would be enormously higher than the initial energy of the\r\nmatch flame.\r\n\r\nMight there not be such a thing as a “nuclear chain reaction”? Could one\r\ninitiate a nuclear reaction that would produce something that would\r\ninitiate more of the same that would produce something that would\r\ninitiate still more of the same and so on?\r\n\r\nIn that case, a nuclear reaction, once started, would continue of its\r\nown accord, and in return for the trifling investment that would serve\r\nto start it—a single neutron, perhaps—a vast amount of breakdowns would\r\nresult with the delivery of a vast amount of energy. Even if it were\r\nnecessary to expend quite a bit of energy to produce the 1 neutron that\r\nwould start the chain reaction, one would end with an enormous profit.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, since the nuclear reaction would spread from nucleus to\r\nnucleus with millionths-of-a-second intervals, there would be, in a very\r\nbrief time, so many nuclei breaking down that there would be a vast\r\nexplosion. The explosion was sure to be millions of times as powerful as\r\nordinary chemical explosions involving the same quantity of exploding\r\nmaterial, since the latter used only the electromagnetic interaction,\r\nwhile the former used the much stronger nuclear interaction.\r\n\r\nThe first to think seriously of such a nuclear chain reaction was the\r\nHungarian physicist Leo Szilard (1898-1964). He was working in Germany\r\nin 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power and, since he was Jewish, he\r\nfelt it would be wise to leave Germany. He went to Great Britain and\r\nthere, in 1934, he considered certain new types of nuclear reactions\r\nthat had been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn these, it sometimes happened that a fast neutron might strike a\r\nnucleus with sufficient energy to cause it to emit 2 neutrons. In that\r\nway the nucleus, absorbing 1 neutron and emitting 2, would become a\r\nlighter isotope of the same element.\r\n\r\nBut what would happen if each of the 2 neutrons that emerged from the\r\noriginal target nucleus struck new nuclei and forced the emission of a\r\npair of neutrons from each. There would now be a total of 4 neutrons\r\nflying about and if each struck new nuclei there would next be 8\r\nneutrons and so on. From the initial investment of a single neutron\r\nthere might soon be countless billions initiating nuclear reactions.\r\n\r\nSzilard, fearing the inevitability of war and fearing further that the\r\nbrutal leaders of Germany might seek and use such a nuclear chain\r\nreaction as a weapon in warfare, secretly applied for a patent on a\r\ndevice intending to make use of such a nuclear chain reaction. He hoped\r\nto turn it over to the British Government, which might then use its\r\npossession as a way of restraining the Nazis and keeping the peace.\r\n\r\nHowever, it wouldn’t have worked. It took the impact of a very energetic\r\nneutron to bring about the emission of 2 neutrons. The neutrons that\r\nthen emerged from the nucleus simply didn’t have enough energy to keep\r\nthings going. (It was like trying to make wet wood catch fire.)\r\n\r\nBut what about uranium fission? Uranium fission was initiated by slow\r\nneutrons. What if uranium fission also produced neutrons as well as\r\nbeing initiated by a neutron? Would not the neutrons produced serve to\r\ninitiate new fissions that would produce new neutrons and so on\r\nendlessly?\r\n\r\nIt seemed very likely that fission produced neutrons and indeed, Fermi,\r\nat the conference where fission was first discussed, suggested it at\r\nonce. Massive nuclei possessed more neutrons per proton than less\r\nmassive ones did. If a massive nucleus was broken up into 2 considerably\r\nless massive ones, there would be a surplus of neutrons. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, uranium-238 broke down into barium-138 and krypton-86.\r\nBarium-138 contains 82 neutrons and krypton-86 50 neutrons for a total\r\nof 132. The uranium-238 nucleus, however, contains 146 neutrons.\r\n\r\nThe uranium fission process was studied at once to see if neutrons were\r\nactually given off and a number of different physicists, including\r\nSzilard, found that they were.\r\n\r\nNow Szilard was faced with a nuclear chain reaction he was certain would\r\nwork. Only slow neutrons were involved and the individual nuclear\r\nbreakdowns were far more energetic than anything else that had yet been\r\ndiscovered. If a chain reaction could be started in a sizable piece of\r\nuranium, unimaginable quantities of energy would be produced. Just 1\r\ngram of uranium, undergoing complete fission, would deliver the energy\r\nderived from the total burning of 3 tons of coal and would deliver that\r\nenergy in a tiny fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nSzilard, who had come to the United States in 1937, clearly visualized\r\nthe tremendous explosive force of something that would have to be called\r\na “nuclear bomb”. Szilard dreaded the possibility that Hitler might\r\nobtain the use of such a bomb through the agency of Germany’s nuclear\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nPartly through Szilard’s efforts, physicists in the United States and in\r\nother Western nations opposed to Hitler began a program of voluntary\r\nsecrecy in 1940, to avoid passing along any hints to Germany. What’s\r\nmore, Szilard enlisted the services of two other Hungarian refugees, the\r\nphysicists Eugene Paul Wigner (1902-    ) and Edward Teller (1908-    )\r\nand all approached Einstein, who had also fled Germany and come to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Leo Szilard_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Eugene P. Wigner_]\r\n\r\nEinstein was the most prestigious scientist then living and it was\r\nthought a letter from him to the President of the United States would be\r\nmost persuasive. Einstein signed such a letter, which explained the\r\npossibility of a nuclear bomb and urged that the United States not allow\r\na potential enemy to come into possession of it first.\r\n\r\nLargely as a result of this letter, a huge research team was put\r\ntogether in the United States, to which other Western nations also\r\ncontributed, with but one aim—to develop the nuclear bomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nuclear Bomb\r\n\r\nAlthough the theory of the nuclear bomb seemed clear and simple, a great\r\nmany practical difficulties stood in the way. In the first place, if\r\nonly uranium atoms underwent fission a supply of uranium had at least to\r\nbe obtained in pure form, for if the neutrons struck nuclei of elements\r\nother than uranium, they would simply be absorbed and removed from the\r\nsystem, ending the possibility of a chain reaction. This alone was a\r\nheavy task, since there had been so little use for uranium in quantity\r\nthat there was almost no supply in existence and no experience in how to\r\npurify it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the supply of uranium might have to be a large one, for\r\nneutrons didn’t necessarily enter the first uranium atom they\r\napproached. They moved about here and there, making glancing collisions,\r\nand travelling quite a distance, perhaps, before striking head-on and\r\nentering a nucleus. If in that time they had passed outside the lump of\r\nuranium, they were useless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Franklin D. Roosevelt]\r\n\r\n  Albert Einstein\r\n  Old Grove Rd.\r\n  Nassau Point\r\n  Peconic, Long Island\r\n\r\n  August 2nd, 1939\r\n\r\n  F.D. Roosevelt,\r\n  President of the United States,\r\n  White House\r\n  Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nSome recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated\r\nto me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be\r\nturned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate\r\nfuture. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call\r\nfor watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the\r\nAdministration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your\r\nattention the following facts and recommendations:\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through\r\nthe work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in\r\nAmerica—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction\r\nin a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large\r\nquantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it\r\nappears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThis new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it\r\nis conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of\r\na new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried\r\nby boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port\r\ntogether with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs\r\nmight very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert Einstein_]\r\n\r\n  The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate\r\n  quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former\r\n  Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian\r\n  Congo.\r\n\r\n  In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some\r\n  permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group\r\n  of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way\r\n  of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person\r\n  who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial\r\n  capacity. His task might comprise the following:\r\n\r\n  a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the\r\n  further development, and put forward recommendations for Government\r\n  action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a\r\n  supply of uranium ore for the United States;\r\n\r\n  b) to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being\r\n  carried on within the limits of the budgets of University\r\n  laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through\r\n  his contacts with private persons who are willing to make\r\n  contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the\r\n  co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary\r\n  equipment.\r\n\r\n  I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium\r\n  from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she\r\n  should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the\r\n  ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von\r\n  Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where\r\n  some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: /signed/]\r\n\r\n(Albert Einstein)\r\n\r\nAs the quantity of uranium within which the fission chain reaction was\r\ninitiated grew larger, more and more of the neutrons produced found a\r\nmark and the fission reaction would die out more and more slowly.\r\nFinally, at some particular size—the “critical size”—the fission\r\nreaction did not die at all, but maintained itself, with enough of the\r\nneutrons produced finding their mark to keep the nuclear reaction\r\nproceeding at a steady rate. At any greater size the nuclear reaction\r\nwould accelerate and there would be an explosion.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t even necessary to send neutrons into the uranium to start the\r\nprocess. In 1941 the Russian physicist Georgii Nikolaevich Flerov\r\n(1913-    ) found that every once in a while a uranium atom would\r\nundergo fission without the introduction of a neutron. Occasionally the\r\nrandom quivering of a nucleus would bring about a shape that the nuclear\r\ninteraction could not bring back to normal and the nucleus would then\r\nbreak apart. In a gram of ordinary uranium, there is a nucleus\r\nundergoing such “spontaneous fission” every 2 minutes on the average.\r\nTherefore, enough uranium need only be brought together to surpass\r\ncritical size and it will explode within seconds, for the first nucleus\r\nthat undergoes spontaneous fission will start the chain reaction.\r\n\r\nFirst estimates made it seem that the quantity of uranium needed to\r\nreach critical size was extraordinarily great. Fully 99.3% of the metal\r\nis uranium-238, however, and, as soon as fission was discovered, Bohr\r\npointed out that there were theoretical reasons for supposing that it\r\nwas the uranium-235 isotope (making up only 0.7% of the whole) that was\r\nthe one undergoing fission. Investigation proved him right. Indeed, the\r\nuranium-238 nucleus tended to absorb slow neutrons without fission, and\r\nto go on to beta-particle production that formed isotopes of neptunium\r\nand plutonium. In this way uranium-238 actually interfered with the\r\nchain reaction.\r\n\r\nIn any quantity of uranium, the more uranium-235 present and the less\r\nuranium-238, the more easily the chain reaction would proceed and the\r\nlower the critical size needed. Vast efforts were therefore made to\r\nseparate the 2 isotopes and prepare uranium with a higher than normal\r\nconcentration of uranium-235 (“enriched uranium”).\r\n\r\nOf course, there was no great desire for a fearful explosion to get out\r\nof hand while the chain reaction was being studied. Before any bomb\r\ncould be constructed, the mechanism of the chain reaction would have to\r\nbe studied. Could a chain reaction capable of producing energy (for\r\nuseful purposes as well as for bombs) be established? To test this, a\r\nquantity of uranium was gathered in the hope that a _controlled_ chain\r\nreaction of uranium fission could be established. For that purpose,\r\ncontrol rods of a substance that would easily absorb neutrons and slow\r\nthe chain reaction were used. The metal, cadmium, served admirably for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the neutrons released by fission were pretty energetic. They\r\ntended to travel too far too soon and get outside the lump of uranium\r\ntoo easily. To produce a chain reaction that could be studied with some\r\nsafety, the presence of a moderator was needed. This was a supply of\r\nsmall nuclei that did not absorb neutrons readily, but absorbed some of\r\nthe energy of collision and slowed down any neutron that struck it.\r\nNuclei such as hydrogen-2, beryllium-9, or carbon-12 were useful\r\nmoderators. When the neutrons produced by fission were slowed, they\r\ntravelled a smaller distance before being absorbed in their turn and the\r\ncritical size would again be reduced.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1942 the initial stage of the project reached a\r\nclimax. Blocks of graphite containing uranium metal and uranium oxide\r\nwere piled up in huge quantities (enriched uranium was not yet\r\navailable) in order to approach critical size. This took place under the\r\nstands of a football stadium at the University of Chicago, with Enrico\r\nFermi (who had come to the United States in 1938) in charge.[1]\r\n\r\nThe large structure was called an “atomic pile” at first because of the\r\nblocks of graphite being piled up. The proper name for such a device,\r\nand the one that was eventually adopted, was, however, “nuclear\r\nreactor”.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, 1942, calculations showed that the nuclear reactor was\r\nlarge enough to have reached critical size. The only thing preventing\r\nthe chain reaction from sustaining itself was the cadmium rods that were\r\ninserted here and there in the pile and that were soaking up neutrons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cutaway model of the West Stands of Stagg Field showing\r\nthe first pile in the squash court beneath it._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The exterior of the building._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Graphite layers form the base of the pile, left. On the\r\nright is the seventh layer of graphite and edges of the sixth layer\r\ncontaining 3¼-inch pseudospheres of black uranium oxide. Beginning with\r\nlayer 6, alternate courses of graphite containing uranium metal and/or\r\nuranium oxide fuel were separated by layers of solid graphite blocks._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tenth layer of graphite blocks containing pseudospheres\r\nof black and brown uranium oxide. The brown briquets, slightly richer in\r\nuranium, were concentrated in the central area. On the right is the\r\nnineteenth layer of graphite covering layer 18 containing slugs of\r\nuranium oxide._]\r\n\r\nOne by one the cadmium rods were pulled out. The number of uranium atoms\r\nundergoing fission each second rose and, finally, at 3:45 p.m., the\r\nuranium fission became self-sustaining. It kept going on its own (with\r\nthe cadmium rods ready to be pushed in if it looked as though it were\r\ngetting out of hand—something calculations showed was not likely).\r\n\r\nNews of this success was announced to Washington by a cautious telephone\r\ncall from Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) to James Bryant Conant\r\n(1893-    ). “The Italian navigator has landed in the new world”, said\r\nCompton. Conant asked, “How were the natives?”, and the answer was,\r\n“Very friendly”.\r\n\r\nThis was the day and moment when the world entered the “nuclear age”.\r\nFor the first time, mankind had constructed a device in which the\r\nnuclear energy being given off was greater than the energy poured in.\r\nMankind had tapped the reservoirs of nuclear energy and could put it to\r\nuse. Had Rutherford lived but 6 more years, he would have seen how wrong\r\nhe was to think it could never be done.\r\n\r\nThe people of earth remained unaware of what had taken place in Chicago\r\nand physicists continued to work toward the development of the nuclear\r\nbomb.\r\n\r\nEnriched uranium was successfully prepared. Critical sizes were brought\r\nlow enough to make a nuclear bomb small enough to be carried by plane to\r\nsome target. Suppose one had 2 slabs of enriched uranium, each below\r\ncritical size, but which were above critical size if combined. And\r\nsuppose an explosive device were added that, at some desired moment,\r\ncould be set off in such a way that it would drive 1 slab of enriched\r\nuranium against the other. There would be an instant explosion of\r\ndevastating power. Or suppose the enriched uranium were arranged in\r\nloosely packed pieces to begin with so that the flying neutrons were in\r\nopen air too often to maintain the chain reaction. A properly arranged\r\nexplosion might compress the uranium into a dense ball. Neutron\r\nabsorption would become more efficient and again, an explosion would\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nuclear Fission of Uranium: A neutron hits the nucleus\r\nof an atom of uranium. The neutron splits the nucleus into two parts and\r\ncreates huge amounts of energy in the form of heat. At the same time\r\nother neutrons are released from the splitting nucleus and these\r\ncontinue the fission process in a chain reaction._]\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1945, a device that would result in a nuclear explosion was\r\nset up near Alamogordo, New Mexico, with nervous physicists watching\r\nfrom a safe distance. It worked perfectly; the explosion was tremendous.\r\n\r\nBy that time Nazi Germany had been defeated, but Japan was still\r\nfighting. Two more devices were prepared. After a warning, one was\r\nexploded over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the\r\nother over Nagasaki 2 days later. The Japanese government surrendered\r\nand World War II came to an end.\r\n\r\nIt was with the blast over Hiroshima that the world came to know it was\r\nin the nuclear age and that the ferocious weapon of the nuclear bomb\r\nexisted. (The popular name for it at the time was “atomic bomb” or\r\n“A-bomb”.)\r\n\r\nDuring the war, German scientists may have been trying to develop a\r\nnuclear bomb, but, if so, they had not yet succeeded at the time Germany\r\nmet its final defeat. Soviet physicists, under Igor Vasilievich\r\nKurchatov (1903-1960), were also working on the problem. The dislocation\r\nof the war, which inflicted much more damage on the Soviet Union than on\r\nthe United States, kept the Soviet effort from succeeding while it was\r\non. However, since the Soviets were among the victors, they were able to\r\ncontinue after the war.\r\n\r\nIn 1949 the Soviets exploded their first nuclear bomb. In 1952 the\r\nBritish did the same; in 1960, the French; and in 1964, the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAlthough many nuclear bombs have been exploded for test purposes, the\r\ntwo over Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been the only ones used in time of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nNor need nuclear bombs be considered as having destructive potential\r\nonly. There is the possibility that, with proper precautions, they might\r\nbe used to make excavations, blast out harbors or canals, break up\r\nunderground rock formations to recover oil or other resources, and in\r\nother ways do the work of chemical explosives with far greater speed and\r\neconomy. It has even been suggested that a series of nuclear bomb\r\nexplosions might be used to hurl space vehicles forward in voyages away\r\nfrom earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNuclear Reactors\r\n\r\nThe development of the nuclear chain reaction was not in the direction\r\nof bombs only. Nuclear reactors designed for the controlled production\r\nof useful energy multiplied in number and in efficiency since Fermi’s\r\nfirst “pile”. Many nations now possess them, and they are used for a\r\nvariety of purposes.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The USS_ Nautilus, _the world’s first nuclear powered\r\nsubmarine, in New York harbor_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1954 the first nuclear submarine the USS _Nautilus_ was launched by\r\nthe United States. Its power was obtained entirely from a nuclear\r\nreactor, and it was not necessary for it to rise to the surface at short\r\nintervals in order to recharge its batteries. Nuclear submarines have\r\ncrossed the Arctic Ocean under the ice cover, and have circumnavigated\r\nthe globe without surfacing.\r\n\r\nIn 1959 both the Soviet Union and the United States launched\r\nnuclear-powered surface vessels. The Soviet ship was the icebreaker,\r\n_Lenin_, and the American ship was a merchant vessel, the NS _Savannah_.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s nuclear reactors were also used as the source of power for\r\nthe production of electricity for civilian use. The Soviet Union built a\r\nsmall station of this sort in 1954, which had a capacity of 5,000\r\nkilowatts. The British built one of 92,000 kilowatt capacity, which they\r\ncalled Calder Hall. The first American nuclear reactor for civilian use\r\nbegan operation at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, in 1958. It was the first\r\nreally full-scale civilian nuclear power plant in the world.\r\n\r\nThe world appeared to have far greater sources of energy than had been\r\nexpected. The “fossil fuels”—coal, oil and natural gas—were being used\r\nat such a rate that many speculated that the gas and oil would be gone\r\nin decades and the coal in centuries. Was it possible that uranium might\r\nnow serve as a new source that would last indefinitely?\r\n\r\nIt was rather disappointing that it was uranium-235 which underwent\r\nfission, because that isotope made up only 0.7% of the uranium that\r\nexisted. If uranium-235 were all we had and all we ever could have, the\r\nenergy supply of the world would still be rather too limited.\r\n\r\nThere were other possible “nuclear fuels”, however. There was\r\nplutonium-239, which would also fission under neutron bombardment. It\r\nhad an ordinary half-life (for a radioactive change in which it gave off\r\nalpha particles) of 24,300 years, which is long enough to make it easy\r\nto handle.\r\n\r\nBut how can plutonium-239 be formed in sufficient quantities to be\r\nuseful? After all, it doesn’t occur in nature. Surprisingly, that turned\r\nout to be easy. Uranium-238 atoms will absorb many of the neutrons that\r\nare constantly leaking out of the reactor and will become first\r\nneptunium-239 and then plutonium-239. The plutonium, being a different\r\nelement from the uranium, can be separated from uranium and obtained in\r\nuseful quantities.\r\n\r\nSuch a device is called a “breeder reactor” because it breeds fuel.\r\nIndeed, it can be so designed to produce more plutonium-239 than the\r\nuranium-235 it uses up, so that you actually end up with more nuclear\r\nfuel than you started with. In this way, all the uranium on earth (and\r\nnot just uranium-235) can be considered potential nuclear fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first\r\nfull-scale, nuclear-electric station built exclusively for civilian\r\nneeds, provides electricity for the homes and factories of the greater\r\nPittsburgh area. The pressurized-water reactor, which now has a\r\n90,000-net-electrical-kilowatt capacity, began commercial operation in\r\n1957. The reactor is in the large building in the center._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The lights of downtown Pittsburgh._]\r\n\r\nThe first breeder reactor was completed at Arco, Idaho, in August 1951,\r\nand on December 20 produced the very first electricity on earth to come\r\nfrom nuclear power. Nevertheless, breeder reactors for commercial use\r\nare still a matter for the future.[3]\r\n\r\nAnother isotope capable of fissioning under neutron bombardment is\r\nuranium-233. It does not occur in nature, but was formed in the\r\nlaboratory by Seaborg and others in 1942. It has a half-life of 162,000\r\nyears. It can be formed from naturally occurring thorium-232.\r\nThorium-232 will absorb a neutron to become thorium-233. Then 2 beta\r\nparticles are given off so that the thorium-233 becomes first\r\nprotactinium-233 and then uranium-233.\r\n\r\nIf a thorium shell surrounds a nuclear reactor, fissionable uranium-233\r\nis formed within it and is easily separated from the thorium. In this\r\nway, thorium is also added to the list of earth’s potential nuclear\r\nfuels.[4]\r\n\r\nIf all the uranium and thorium in the earth’s crust (including the thin\r\nscattering of those elements through granite, for instance) were\r\navailable for use, we might get up to 100 times as much energy from it\r\nas from all the coal and oil on the planet. Unfortunately, it is very\r\nunlikely that we will ever be able to make use of all the uranium and\r\nthorium. It is widely and thinly spread through the crustal rocks and\r\nmuch of it could not be extracted without using up more energy than\r\nwould be supplied by it once isolated.\r\n\r\nAnother problem rests with the nature of the fission reaction. When the\r\nuranium-235 nucleus (or plutonium-239 or uranium-233) undergoes fission,\r\nit breaks up into any of a large number of middle-sized nuclei that are\r\nradioactive—much more intensely radioactive than the original fuel. (It\r\nwas from among these “fission products” that isotopes of element 61 were\r\nfirst obtained in 1945. Coming from the nuclear fire, it reminded its\r\ndiscoverers of Prometheus, who stole fire from the sun in the Greek\r\nmyths, and so it was called “promethium”.)\r\n\r\nThe fission products still contain energy and some of them can be used\r\nin lightweight “nuclear batteries”. Such nuclear batteries were first\r\nbuilt in 1954. Some batteries, using plutonium-238 rather than fission\r\nproducts, have been put to use in powering artificial satellites over\r\nlong periods.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, only a small proportion of the fission products can be\r\nput to profitable use. Most must be disposed of. They are dangerous\r\nbecause the radiations they give off are deadly and cannot be detected\r\nby the ordinary senses. They are very difficult to dispose of safely,\r\nand they must not be allowed to get into the environment, especially\r\nsince some of them remain dangerous for decades or even centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 2 building complex\r\nin Idaho. The reactor is in the dome-shaped structure._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NUCLEAR FUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Energy of the Sun\r\n\r\nAs it happens, though, nuclear fission is not the only route to useful\r\nnuclear energy.\r\n\r\nAston’s studies in the 1920s had shown that it was the middle-sized\r\nnuclei that were most tightly packed. Energy would be given off if\r\nmiddle-sized nuclei were produced from either extreme. Not only would\r\nenergy be formed by the breakup of particularly massive nuclei through\r\nfission, but also through the combination of small nuclei to form larger\r\nones (“nuclear fusion”).\r\n\r\nIn fact, from Aston’s studies it could be seen that, mass for mass,\r\nnuclear fusion would produce far more energy than nuclear fission. This\r\nwas particularly true in the conversion of hydrogen to helium; that is,\r\nthe conversion of the individual protons of 4 separate hydrogen nuclei\r\ninto the 2-proton—2-neutron structure of the helium nucleus. A gram of\r\nhydrogen, undergoing fusion to helium, would deliver some fifteen times\r\nas much energy as a gram of uranium undergoing fission.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1920, the English astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington\r\n(1882-1944) had speculated that the sun’s energy might be derived from\r\nthe interaction of subatomic particles. Some sort of nuclear reaction\r\nseemed, by then, to be the most reasonable way of accounting for the\r\nvast energies constantly being produced by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe speculation became more plausible with each year. Eddington himself\r\nstudied the structure of stars, and by 1926 had produced convincing\r\ntheoretical reasons for supposing that the center of the sun was at\r\nenormous densities and temperatures. A temperature of some 15,000,000 to\r\n20,000,000°C seemed to characterize the sun’s center.\r\n\r\nAt such temperatures, atoms could not exist in earthly fashion. Held\r\ntogether by the sun’s strong gravitational field, they collided with\r\nsuch energy that all or almost all their electrons were stripped off,\r\nand little more than bare nuclei were left. These bare nuclei could\r\napproach each other much more closely than whole atoms could (which was\r\nwhy the center of the sun was so much more dense than earthly matter\r\ncould be). The bare nuclei, smashing together at central-sun\r\ntemperatures, could cling together and form more complex nuclei. Nuclear\r\nreactions brought about by such intense heat (millions of degrees) are\r\ncalled “thermonuclear reactions”.\r\n\r\nAs the 1920s progressed further studies of the chemical structure of the\r\nsun showed it to be even richer in hydrogen than had been thought. In\r\n1929 the American astronomer Henry Norris Russell (1877-1957) reported\r\nevidence that the sun was 60% hydrogen in volume. (Even this was too\r\nconservative; 80% is considered more nearly correct now.) If the sun’s\r\nenergy were based on nuclear reactions at all, then it had to be the\r\nresult of hydrogen fusion. Nothing else was present in sufficient\r\nquantity to be useful as a fuel.\r\n\r\nMore and more was learned about the exact manner in which nuclei\r\ninteracted and about the quantity of energy given off in particular\r\nnuclear reactions. It became possible to calculate what might be going\r\non inside the sun by considering the densities and temperatures present,\r\nthe kind and number of different nuclei available, and the quantity of\r\nenergy that must be produced. In 1938 the German-American physicist Hans\r\nAlbrecht Bethe (1906-    ) and the German astronomer Carl Friedrich von\r\nWeizsäcker (1912-    ) independently worked out the possible reactions,\r\nand hydrogen fusion was shown to be a thoroughly practical way of\r\nkeeping the sun going.\r\n\r\nThanks to the high rate of energy production by thermonuclear reactions\r\nand to the vast quantity of hydrogen in the sun, not only has it been\r\npossible for the sun to have been radiating energy for the last\r\n5,000,000,000 years or so, but it will continue to radiate energy in the\r\npresent fashion for at least 5,000,000,000 years into the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hans Bethe_]\r\n\r\nEven so, the sheer quantity of what is going on in the sun is staggering\r\nin earthly terms. In the sun 650,000,000 tons of hydrogen are converted\r\ninto helium every second, and in the process each second sees the\r\ndisappearance of 4,600,000 tons of mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThermonuclear Bombs\r\n\r\nCould thermonuclear reactions be made to take place on earth? The\r\nconditions that exist in the center of the sun would be extremely\r\ndifficult to duplicate on the earth, so there was a natural search for\r\nany kind of nuclear fusion that would produce similar energies to those\r\ngoing on in the sun but which would be easier to bring about.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 hydrogen isotopes known to exist. Ordinary hydrogen is\r\nalmost entirely hydrogen-1, with a nucleus made up of a single proton.\r\nSmall quantities of hydrogen-2 (deuterium) with a nucleus made up of a\r\nproton plus a neutron also exist and such atoms are perfectly stable.\r\n\r\nIn 1934 Rutherford, along with the Australian physicist Marcus Laurence\r\nElwin Oliphant (1901-    ) and the Austrian chemist Paul Harteck\r\n(1902-    ) sent hydrogen-2 nuclei flying into hydrogen-2 targets and\r\nformed hydrogen-3 (also called “tritium” from the Greek word for\r\n“third”) with a nucleus made up of a proton plus 2 neutrons. Hydrogen-3\r\nis mildly radioactive.\r\n\r\nHydrogen-2 fuses to helium more easily than hydrogen-1 does and, all\r\nthings being equal, hydrogen-2 will do so at lower temperatures than\r\nhydrogen-1. Hydrogen-3 requires lower temperatures still. But even for\r\nhydrogen-3 it still takes millions of degrees.\r\n\r\nHydrogen-3, although the easiest to be forced to undergo fusion, exists\r\nonly in tiny quantities.\r\n\r\nHydrogen-2, therefore, is the one to pin hopes on especially in\r\nconjunction with hydrogen-3. Only 1 atom out of every 6000 hydrogen\r\natoms is hydrogen-2, but that is enough. There exists a vast ocean on\r\nearth that is made up almost entirely of water molecules and in each\r\nwater molecule 2 hydrogen atoms are present. Even if only 1 in 6000 of\r\nthese hydrogen atoms is deuterium that still means there are about\r\n35,000 billion tons of deuterium in the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, it isn’t necessary to dig for that deuterium or to drill\r\nfor it. If ocean water is allowed to run through separation plants, the\r\ndeuterium can be extracted without very much trouble. In fact, for the\r\nenergy you could get out of it, deuterium from the oceans, extracted by\r\npresent methods and without allowing for future improvement, would be\r\nonly one-hundredth as expensive as coal.\r\n\r\nThe deuterium in the world’s ocean, if allowed to undergo fusion little\r\nby little, would supply mankind with enough energy to keep us going at\r\nthe present rate for 500,000,000,000 years. To be sure, to make\r\ndeuterium fusion practical, it may be necessary to make use of rarer\r\nsubstances such as the light metal lithium. This will place a sharper\r\nlimit on the energy supply but even if we are careful, fusion would\r\nprobably supply mankind with energy for as long as mankind will exist.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there would seem to be no danger of hydrogen fusion plants\r\nrunning out of control. Only small quantities of deuterium would be in\r\nthe process of fusion at any one time. If anything at all went wrong,\r\nthe deuterium supply could be automatically cut off and the fusion\r\nprocess, with so little involved, would then stop instantly. Moreover,\r\nthere would be less reason to worry about atomic wastes, for the most\r\ndangerous products—hydrogen-3 and neutrons—could be easily taken care\r\nof.\r\n\r\nIt seems ideal, but there is a catch. However clear the theory, before a\r\nfusion power station can be established some practical method must be\r\nfound to start the fusion process, which means finding some way for\r\nattaining temperatures in the millions of degrees.\r\n\r\nOne method for obtaining the necessary temperature was known by 1945. An\r\nexploding fission bomb would do it. If, somehow, the necessary\r\nhydrogen-2 was combined with a fission bomb, the explosion would set off\r\na fusion reaction that would greatly multiply the energy released. You\r\nwould have in effect a “thermonuclear bomb”. (To the general public,\r\nthis was commonly known as a “hydrogen bomb” or an “H-bomb”.)\r\n\r\nIn 1952 the first fusion device was exploded by the United States in the\r\nMarshall Islands. Within months, the Soviet Union had exploded one of\r\nits own and in time thermonuclear bombs thousands of times as powerful\r\nas the first fission bomb over Hiroshima were built and exploded.\r\n\r\nAll thermonuclear bombs have been exploded only for test purposes. Even\r\ntesting seems to be dangerous, however, at least if it is carried on in\r\nthe open atmosphere. The radioactivity liberated spreads over the world\r\nand may do slow but cumulative damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nControlled Fusion\r\n\r\nHowever effective a fusion bomb may be in liberating vast quantities of\r\nenergy, it is not what one has in mind when speaking of a fusion power\r\nstation. The energy of a fusion bomb is released all at once and its\r\nonly function is that of utter destruction. What is wanted is the\r\nproduction of fusion energy at a low and steady rate—a rate that is\r\nunder the control of human operators.\r\n\r\nThe sun, for instance, is a vast fusion furnace 866,000 miles across,\r\nbut it is a controlled one—even though that control is exerted by the\r\nimpersonal laws of nature. It releases energy at a very steady and very\r\nslow rate. (The rate is not slow in human terms, of course, but stars\r\nsometimes do release their energy in a much more cataclysmic fashion.\r\nThe result is a “supernova” in which for a short time a single star will\r\nincrease its radiation to as much as a trillion times its normal level.)\r\n\r\nThe sun (or any star) going at its normal rate is controlled and steady\r\nin its output because of the advantage of huge mass. An enormous mass,\r\ncomposed mainly of hydrogen, compresses itself, through its equally\r\nenormous gravitational field, into huge densities and temperatures at\r\nits center, thus igniting the fusion reaction—while the same\r\ngravitational field keeps the sun together against its tendency to\r\nexpand.\r\n\r\nThere is, as far as scientists know, no conceivable way of concentrating\r\na high gravitational field in the absence of the required mass, and the\r\ncreation of controlled fusion on earth must therefore be done without\r\nthe aid of gravity. Without a huge gravitational force we cannot\r\nsimultaneously bring about sun-center densities and sun-center\r\ntemperatures; one or the other must go.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it would take much less energy to aim at the temperatures\r\nthan at the densities and would be much more feasible. For this reason,\r\nphysicists have been attempting, all through the nuclear age, to heat\r\nthin wisps of hydrogen to enormous temperature. Since the gas is thin,\r\nthe nuclei are farther apart and collide with each other far fewer times\r\nper second. To achieve fusion ignition, therefore, temperatures must be\r\nconsiderably higher than those at the center of the sun. In 1944 Fermi\r\ncalculated that it might take a temperature of 50,000,000° to ignite a\r\nhydrogen-3 fusion with hydrogen-2 under earthly conditions, and\r\n400,000,000° to ignite hydrogen-2 fusion alone. To ignite hydrogen-1\r\nfusion, which is what goes on in the sun (at a mere 15,000,000°),\r\nphysicists would have to raise their sights to beyond the billion-degree\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A supernova photographed on March 10, 1935._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The same star on May 6._]\r\n\r\nThis would make it seem almost essential to use hydrogen-3 in one\r\nfashion or another. Even if it can’t be prepared in quantity to begin\r\nwith, it might be formed by neutron bombardment of lithium, with the\r\nneutrons being formed by the fusion reaction. In this way, you would\r\nstart with lithium and hydrogen-2 plus a little hydrogen-3. The\r\nhydrogen-3 is formed as fast as it is used up. Although in the end\r\nhydrogen is converted to helium in a controlled fusion reaction as in\r\nthe sun, the individual steps in the reaction under human control are\r\nquite different from those in the sun.\r\n\r\nStill, even the temperatures required for hydrogen-3 represent an\r\nenormous problem, particularly since the temperature must not only be\r\nreached, but must be held for a period of time. (You can pass a piece of\r\npaper rapidly through a candle flame without lighting it. It must be\r\nheld in the flame for a short period to give it a chance to heat and\r\nignite.)\r\n\r\nThe English physicist John David Lawson (1923-    ) worked out the\r\nrequirements in 1957. The time depended on the density of the gas. The\r\ndenser the gas, the shorter the period over which the temperature had to\r\nbe maintained. If the gas is about one hundred-thousand times as dense\r\nas air, the proper temperature must be held, under the most favorable\r\nconditions, for about one thousandth of a second.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different ways in which a quantity of hydrogen can\r\nbe heated to very high temperatures—through electric currents, through\r\nmagnetic fields, through laser beams and so on. As the temperature goes\r\nup into the tens of thousands of degrees, the hydrogen atoms (or any\r\natoms) are broken up into free electrons and bare nuclei. Such a mixture\r\nof charged particles is called a “plasma”. Ever since physicists have\r\nbegun to try to work with very hot gases, with fusion energy in mind,\r\nthey have had to study the properties of such “plasma”, and a whole new\r\nscience of “plasma physics” has come into existence.\r\n\r\nBut if you do heat a gas to very high temperatures, it will tend to\r\nexpand and thin out to uselessness. How can such a super-hot gas be\r\nconfined in a fixed volume without an enormous gravitational field to\r\nhold it together?\r\n\r\nAn obvious answer would be to place it in a container, but no ordinary\r\ncontainer of matter will serve to hold the hot gas. You may think this\r\nis because the temperature of the gas will simply melt or vaporize\r\nwhatever matter encloses it. This is not so. Although the gas is at a\r\nvery high temperature, it is so thin that it has very little total heat.\r\nIt does not have enough heat to melt the solid walls of a container.\r\nWhat happens instead is that the hot plasma cools down the moment it\r\ntouches the solid walls and the entire attempt to heat it is ruined.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, if you try to invest the enormous energies required to keep\r\nthe plasma hot despite the cooling effect of the container walls, then\r\nthe walls will gradually heat and melt. Nor must one wait for the walls\r\nto melt and the plasma to escape before finding the attempt at fusion\r\nruined. Even as the walls heat up they liberate some of their own atoms\r\ninto the plasma and introduce impurities that will prevent the fusion\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAny material container is therefore out of the question.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there is a nonmaterial way of confining plasma. Since\r\nplasma consists of a mixture of electrically charged particles, it can\r\nexperience electromagnetic interactions. Instead of keeping the plasma\r\nin a material container, you can surround it by a magnetic field that is\r\ndesigned to keep it in place. Such a magnetic field is not affected by\r\nany heat, however great, and cannot be a source of material impurity.\r\n\r\nIn 1934, the American physicist Willard Harrison Bennett (1903-    ) had\r\nworked out a theory dealing with the behavior of magnetic fields\r\nenclosing plasma. It came to be called the “pinch effect” because the\r\nmagnetic field pinched the gas together and held it in place.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to make use of the pinch effect for confining plasma,\r\nwith eventual ignition of fusion in mind, was in 1951 by the English\r\nphysicist Alan Alfred Ware (1924-    ). Other physicists followed, not\r\nonly in Great Britain, but in the United States and the Soviet Union as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe first use of the pinch effect was to confine the plasma in a\r\ncylinder. This, however, could not be made to work. The situation was\r\ntoo unstable. The plasma was held momentarily, then writhed and broke\r\nup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plasma in a magnetic field._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Enormous machines and complex equipment, such as the\r\nScyllac machine shown above, are required for nuclear fusion research._]\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to remove the instability. The field was so designed\r\nas to be stronger at the ends of the cylinder than elsewhere. The\r\nparticles in the plasma would stream toward one end or another and would\r\nthen bounce back producing a so-called “magnetic mirror”.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 the American physicist Lyman Spitzer, Jr. (1914-    ) had worked\r\nout the theoretical benefits to be derived from a container twisted into\r\na figure-eight shape. Eventually, such devices were built and called\r\n“stellarators” from the Latin word for “star”, because it was hoped that\r\nit would produce the conditions that would allow the sort of fusion\r\nreactions that went on in stars.\r\n\r\nAll through the 1950s and 1960s, physicists have been slowly inching\r\ntoward their goal, reaching higher and higher temperatures and holding\r\nthem for longer and longer periods in denser and denser gases.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 the Soviet Union used a device called “Tokamak-3” (a Russian\r\nabbreviation for their phrase for “electric-magnetic”) to keep a supply\r\nof hydrogen-2, a millionth as dense as air, in place while heating it to\r\ntens of millions of degrees for a hundredth of a second.\r\n\r\nA little denser, a little hotter, a little longer—and controlled fusion\r\nmight become possible.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BEYOND FUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAntimatter\r\n\r\nIs there anything that lies beyond fusion?\r\n\r\nWhen hydrogen undergoes fusion and becomes helium, only 0.7% of the\r\noriginal mass of the hydrogen is converted to energy. Is it possible to\r\ntake a quantity of mass and convert all of it, every bit, to energy?\r\nSurely that would be the ultimate energy source. Mass for mass, that\r\nwould deliver 140 times as much energy as hydrogen fusion would; it\r\nwould be as far beyond hydrogen fusion as hydrogen fusion is beyond\r\nuranium fission.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a matter of fact, total annihilation of matter is conceivable\r\nunder some circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn 1928 the English physicist Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902-    )\r\npresented a treatment of the electron’s properties that made it appear\r\nas though there ought also to exist a particle exactly like the electron\r\nin every respect except that it would be opposite in charge. It would\r\ncarry a positive electric charge exactly as large as the electron’s\r\nnegative one.\r\n\r\nIf the electron is a particle, this suggested positively charged twin\r\nwould be an “antiparticle”. (The prefix comes from a Greek word meaning\r\n“opposite”.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _P. A. M. Dirac_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The first picture of the positron (left) was taken in a\r\nWilson cloud chamber. On the right is C. D. Anderson, the discoverer of\r\nthe positron._]\r\n\r\nThe proton is _not_ the electron’s antiparticle. Though a proton carries\r\nthe necessary positive charge that is exactly as large as the negative\r\ncharge of the electron, the proton has a much larger mass than the\r\nelectron has. Dirac’s theory required that the antiparticle have the\r\nsame mass as the particle to which it corresponded.\r\n\r\nIn 1932 C. D. Anderson was studying the impact of cosmic particles on\r\nlead. In the process, he discovered signs of a particle that left tracks\r\nexactly like those of an electron, but tracks that curved the wrong way\r\nin a magnetic field. This was a sure sign that it had an electric charge\r\nopposite to that of the electron. He had, in short, discovered the\r\nelectron’s antiparticle and this came to be called the “positron”.\r\n\r\nPositrons were soon detected elsewhere too. Some radioactive isotopes,\r\nformed in the laboratory by the Joliot-Curies and by others, were found\r\nto emit positive beta particles—positrons rather than electrons. When an\r\nordinary beta particle, or electron, was emitted from a nucleus, a\r\nneutron within the nucleus was converted to a proton. When a positive\r\nbeta particle, a positron, was emitted, the reverse happened—a proton\r\nwas converted to a neutron.\r\n\r\nA positron, however, does not endure long after formation. All about it\r\nwere atoms containing electrons. It could not move for more than a\r\nmillionth of a second or so before it encountered one of those\r\nelectrons. When it did, there was an attraction between the two, since\r\nthey were of opposite electric charge. Briefly they might circle each\r\nother (to form a combination called “positronium”) but only very\r\nbriefly. Then they collided and, since they were opposites, each\r\ncancelled the other.\r\n\r\nThe process whereby an electron and a positron met and cancelled is\r\ncalled “mutual annihilation”. Not everything was gone, though. The mass,\r\nin disappearing, was converted into the equivalent amount of energy,\r\nwhich made its appearance in the form of one or more gamma rays.\r\n\r\n(It works the other way, too. A gamma ray of sufficient energy can be\r\ntransformed into an electron and a positron. This phenomenon, called\r\n“pair production”, was observed as early as 1930 but was only properly\r\nunderstood after the discovery of the positron.)\r\n\r\nOf course, the mass of electrons and positrons is very small and the\r\namount of energy released per electron is not enormously high. Still,\r\nDirac’s original theory of antiparticles was not confined to electrons.\r\nBy his theory, any particle ought to have some corresponding\r\nantiparticle. Corresponding to the proton, for instance, there ought to\r\nbe an “antiproton”. This would be just as massive as the proton and\r\nwould carry a negative charge just as large as the proton’s positive\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAn antiproton, however, is 1836 times as massive as a positron. It would\r\ntake gamma rays or cosmic particles with 1836 times as much energy to\r\nform the proton-antiproton pair as would suffice for the\r\nelectron-positron pair. Cosmic particles of the necessary energies\r\nexisted but they were rare and the chance of someone being present with\r\na particle detector just as a rare super-energetic cosmic particle\r\nhappened to form a proton-antiproton pair was very small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Bevatron began operation in 1954._]\r\n\r\nPhysicists had to wait until they had succeeded in designing particle\r\naccelerators that would produce enough energy to allow the creation of\r\nproton-antiproton pairs. This came about in the early 1950s when a\r\ndevice called the “Cosmotron” was built at Brookhaven National\r\nLaboratory in Long Island in 1952 and another called the “Bevatron” at\r\nthe University of California in Berkeley in 1954.\r\n\r\nUsing the Bevatron in 1956, Segrè (the discoverer of technetium who had,\r\nby that time, emigrated to the United States), the American physicist\r\nOwen Chamberlain (1920-    ), and others succeeded in detecting the\r\nantiproton.\r\n\r\nThe antiproton was as unlikely to last as long as the positron was. It\r\nwas surrounded by myriads of proton-containing nuclei and in a tiny\r\nfraction of a second it would encounter one. The antiproton and the\r\nproton also underwent mutual annihilation, but having 1836 times the\r\nmass, they produced 1836 times the energy that was produced in the case\r\nof an electron and a positron.\r\n\r\nThere was even an “antineutron”, a particle reported in 1956 by the\r\nItalian-American physicist Oreste Piccioni (1915-    ) and his\r\nco-workers. Since the neutron has no charge, the antineutron has no\r\ncharge either, and one might wonder how the antineutron would differ\r\nfrom the neutron then. Actually, both have a small magnetic field. In\r\nthe neutron the magnetic field is pointed in one direction with\r\nreference to the neutron’s spin; in the antineutron it is pointed in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bubble chamber photograph of an antiproton\r\nannihilation._]\r\n\r\nIn 1965 the American physicist Leon Max Lederman (1922-    ) and his\r\nco-workers produced a combination of an antiproton and an antineutron\r\nthat together formed an “antideuteron”, which is the nucleus of\r\nantihydrogen-2.\r\n\r\nThis is good enough to demonstrate that if antiparticles existed by\r\nthemselves without the interfering presence of ordinary particles, they\r\ncould form “antimatter”, which would be precisely identical with\r\nordinary matter in every way except for the fact that electric charges\r\nand magnetic fields would be turned around.\r\n\r\nIf antimatter were available to us, and if we could control the manner\r\nin which it united with matter, we would have a source of energy much\r\ngreater and, perhaps, simpler to produce than would be involved in\r\nhydrogen fusion.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there is no antimatter on earth, except for the\r\nsubmicroscopic amounts that are formed by the input of tremendous\r\nenergies. Nor does anyone know of any conceivable way of forming\r\nantimatter at less energy than that produced by mutual annihilation, so\r\nthat we might say that mankind can never make an energy profit out of\r\nit—except that with the memory of Rutherford’s prediction that nuclear\r\nenergy of any kind could never be tapped, one hesitates to be\r\npessimistic about anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unknown\r\n\r\nPhysical theory makes it seem that particles and antiparticles ought to\r\nexist in the universe in equal quantities. Yet on earth (and, we can be\r\nquite certain, in the rest of the solar system and even, very likely, in\r\nthe rest of the galaxy) protons, neutrons, and electrons are common,\r\nwhile antiprotons, antineutrons, and positrons are exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nCould it be that when the universe was first formed there were indeed\r\nequal quantities of particles and antiparticles but that they were\r\nsomehow segregated, perhaps into galaxies and “antigalaxies”? If so,\r\nthere might occasionally be collisions of a galaxy and an antigalaxy\r\nwith the evolution of vast quantities of energy as mutual annihilation\r\non a cosmic scale takes place.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, places in the heavens where radiation is unusually\r\nhigh in quantity and in energy. Can we be witnessing such enormous\r\nmutual annihilation?\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is not altogether inconceivable that we may still have new\r\ntypes of forces and new sources of energy to discover. Until about 1900,\r\nno one suspected the existence of nuclear energy. Are we quite sure now\r\nthat nuclear energy brings us to the end, and that there is not a form\r\nof energy more subtle still, and greater?\r\n\r\nIn 1962, for instance, certain puzzling objects called “quasars” were\r\ndiscovered far out in space, a billion light-years or more away from us.\r\nEach one shines from 10 to 100 times as brilliantly as an entire\r\nordinary galaxy does, and yet may be no more than a hundred-thousandth\r\nas wide as a galaxy.\r\n\r\nThis is something like finding an object 10 miles across that delivers\r\nas much total light as 100 suns.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to understand where all that energy comes from and why\r\nit should be concentrated into so tiny a volume. Astronomers have tried\r\nto explain it in terms of the four interactions now known, but is it\r\npossible that there is a fifth greater than any of the four?\r\n\r\nIf so, it is not impossible that eventually man’s restless brain may\r\ncome to understand and even utilize it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]See _The First Reactor_, another booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n[2]See _Nuclear Reactors_ and _Nuclear Power Plants_, companion booklets\r\n    in this series.\r\n\r\n[3]See _Breeder Reactors_, another booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n[4]See _Thorium—and the Third Fuel_, another booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n[5]See _Controlled Nuclear Fusion_, another booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            QUOTATION CREDIT\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inside front cover    Copyright © by Abelard-Shuman, Ltd., New York.\r\n                        Reprinted by permission from _Inside the Atom_,\r\n                        Isaac Asimov, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              READING LIST\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Books\r\n\r\n  _Basic Laws of Matter_ (revised edition), Harrie S.
