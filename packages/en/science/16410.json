Considerations of space\r\nforbid anything like an exhaustive treatment of so vast a subject, and\r\nsome aspects of the question, the physiological for example, are almost\r\nneglected. Other books already published in this series, such as Dr\r\nGordon Hewitt's _House-flies_ and Mr O H. Latter's _Bees and Wasps_, may\r\nbe consulted with advantage for details of special insect life-stories.\r\nRecent researches have emphasised the practical importance to human\r\nsociety of entomological study, and insects will always be a source of\r\ndelight to the lover of nature. This humble volume will best serve its\r\nobject if its reading should lead fresh observers to the brookside and\r\nthe woodland.\r\n\r\nG.H.C.\r\n\r\nDUBLIN,\r\n\r\n_July_, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAP.

The schoolboy watches the\r\ntiny green caterpillars hatched from eggs laid on a cabbage leaf by the\r\ncommon white butterfly, or maybe rears successfully a batch of silkworms\r\nthrough the changes and chances of their lives, while the naturalist\r\nquestions yet again the 'how' and 'why' of these common though wondrous\r\nlife-stories, as he seeks to trace their course more fully than his\r\npredecessors knew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. _a_, Diamond-back Moth (_Plutella\r\ncruciferarum_); _b_, young caterpillar, dorsal view; _c_, full-grown\r\ncaterpillar, dorsal view; _d_, side view; _e_, pupa, ventral view.\r\nMagnified 6 times. From _Journ. Dept. Agric. Ireland_, vol. I.]\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar with the main facts of such a life-story as that of\r\na moth or butterfly. The form of the adult insect (fig. 1 _a_) is\r\ndominated by the wings--two pairs of scaly wings, carried respectively\r\non the middle and hindmost of the three segments that make up the\r\n_thorax_ or central region of the insect's body. Each of these three\r\nsegments carries a pair of legs. In front of the thorax is the head on\r\nwhich the pair of long jointed feelers and the pair of large,\r\nsub-globular, compound eyes are the most prominent features. Below the\r\nhead, however, may be seen, now coiled up like a watch-spring, now\r\nstretched out to draw the nectar from some scented blossom, the\r\nbutterfly's sucking trunk or proboscis, situated between a pair of short\r\nhairy limbs or palps (fig. 2). These palps belong to the appendages of\r\nthe hindmost segment of the head, appendages which in insects are\r\nmodified to form a hind-lip or _labium_, bounding the mouth cavity below\r\nor behind. The proboscis is made up of the pair of jaw-appendages in\r\nfront of the labium, the _maxillae_, as they are called. Behind the\r\nthorax is situated the _abdomen,_ made up of nine or ten recognisable\r\nsegments, none of which carry limbs comparable to the walking legs, or\r\nto the jaws which are the modified limbs of the head-segments. The whole\r\ncuticle or outer covering of the body, formed (as is usual in the group\r\nof animals to which insects belong) of a horny (chitinous) secretion of\r\nthe skin, is firm and hard, and densely covered with hairy or scaly\r\noutgrowths. Along the sides of the insect are a series of paired\r\nopenings or spiracles, leading to a set of air-tubes which ramify\r\nthroughout the body and carry oxygen directly to the tissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. A. Head of a typical Moth, showing proboscis\r\nformed by flexible maxillae (_g_) between the labial palps (_p_); _c_,\r\nface; _e_, eye; the structure _m_ has been regarded as the vestige of a\r\nmandible. B. Basal part (_b_) of maxilla removed from head, with\r\nvestigial palp (_p_). Magnified.]\r\n\r\nSuch a butterfly as we have briefly sketched lays an egg on the leaf of\r\nsome suitable food-plant, and there is hatched from it the well-known\r\ncrawling larva[1] (fig. 1 _b, c, d_) called a caterpillar, offering in\r\nmany superficial features a marked contrast to its parent. Except on the\r\nhead, whose surface is hard and firm, the caterpillar's cuticle is as a\r\nrule thin and flexible, though it may carry a protective armature of\r\nclosely set hairs, or strong sharp spines. The feelers (fig. 3 _At_) are\r\nvery short and the eyes are small and simple. In connection with the\r\nmouth, there are present in front of the maxillae a pair of _mandibles_\r\n(fig. 3 _Mn_), strong jaws, adapted for biting solid food, which are\r\nabsent from the adult butterfly, though well developed in cockroaches,\r\ndragon-flies, beetles, and many other insects. The three pairs of legs\r\non the segments of the thorax are relatively short, and as many as five\r\nsegments of the abdomen may carry short cylindrical limbs or pro-legs,\r\nwhich assist the clinging habits and worm-like locomotion of the\r\ncaterpillar. No trace of wings is visible externally. The caterpillar,\r\ntherefore, differs markedly from its parent in its outward structure, in\r\nits mode of progression, and in its manner of feeding; for while the\r\nbutterfly sucks nectar or other liquid food, the caterpillar bites up\r\nand devours solid vegetable substances, such as the leaves of herbs or\r\ntrees. It is well-known that between the close of its larval life and\r\nits attainment of perfection as a butterfly, the insect spends a\r\nperiod as a _pupa_ (fig. 1 _e_) unable to move from place to place, and\r\ntaking no food.\r\n\r\n[1] The term _larva_ is applied to any young animal which differs\r\nmarkedly from its parent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Head of Caterpillar of Goat-moth (_Cossus_) seen\r\nfrom behind. _At_, feeler; _Mn_, mandible; _Mx_, maxilla; _Lm_, labium,\r\nspinneret projecting beyond it. Magnified. After Lyonet from Miall and\r\nDenny's _Cockroach_.]\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the course of the most familiar of insect\r\nlife-stories. For the student of the animal world as a whole, this\r\nfamiliar transformation raises some startling problems, which have been\r\nsuggestively treated by F. Brauer (1869), L.C. Miall (1895), J. Lubbock\r\n(1874), R. Heymons (1907), P. Deegener (1909) and other writers[2]. To\r\nappreciate these problems is the first step towards learning the true\r\nmeaning of the transformation.\r\n\r\n[2] The dates in brackets after authors' names will facilitate reference\r\nto the Bibliography (pp. 124-8).\r\n\r\nThe butterfly's egg is absolutely and relatively of large size, and\r\ncontains a considerable amount of yolk. As a rule we find that young\r\nanimals hatched from such eggs resemble their parents rather closely and\r\npass through no marked changes during their lives. A chicken, a\r\ncrocodile, a dogfish, a cuttlefish, and a spider afford well-known\r\nexamples of this rule. Land-animals, generally, produce young which are\r\nminiature copies of themselves, for example horses, dogs, and other\r\nmammals, snails and slugs, scorpions and earthworms. On the other hand,\r\nmetamorphosis among animals is associated with eggs of small size, with\r\naquatic habit, and with relatively low zoological rank. The young of a\r\nstarfish, for example, has hardly a character in common with its parent,\r\nwhile a marine segmented worm and an oyster, unlike enough when adult,\r\ndevelop from closely similar larval forms. If we take a class of\r\nanimals, the Crustacea, nearly allied to insects, we find that its more\r\nlowly members, such as 'water-fleas' and barnacles, pass through far\r\nmore striking changes than its higher groups, such as lobsters and\r\nwoodlice. But among the Insects, a class of predominantly terrestrial\r\nand aerial creatures producing large eggs, the highest groups undergo,\r\nas we shall see, the most profound changes. The life-story of the\r\nbutterfly, then, well-known as it may be, furnishes a puzzling exception\r\nto some wide-reaching generalisations concerning animal development. And\r\nthe student of science often finds that an exception to some rule is the\r\nkey to a problem of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nDuring many centuries naturalists have bent their energies to explain\r\nthe difficulties presented by insect transformations. Aristotle, the\r\nfirst serious student of organised beings whose writings have been\r\npreserved for us, and William Harvey, the famous demonstrator of the\r\nmammalian blood circulation two thousand years later, agreed in\r\nregarding the pupa as a second egg. The egg laid by a butterfly had not,\r\naccording to Harvey, enough store of food to provide for the building-up\r\nof a complex organism like the parent; only the imperfect larva could be\r\nproduced from it. The larva was regarded as feeding voraciously for the\r\npurpose of acquiring a large store of nutritive material, after which it\r\nwas believed to revert to the state of a second but far larger egg, the\r\npupa, from which the winged insect could take origin. Others again,\r\nfollowing de Réaumur (1734), have speculated whether the development of\r\npupa within larva, and of winged insect within pupa might not be\r\nexplained as abnormal births. But a comparison of the transformation of\r\nbutterflies with simpler insect life-stories will convince the enquirer\r\nthat no such heroic theories as these are necessary. It will be realised\r\nthat even the most profound transformation among insects can be\r\nexplained as a special case of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar differs markedly from the butterfly. As we pursue our\r\nstudies of insect growth and transformation we shall find that in some\r\ncases the difference between young and adult is much greater--as for\r\nexample between the maggot and the house-fly, in others far less--as\r\nbetween the young and full-grown grasshopper or plant-bug. It is\r\nevidently wise to begin a general survey of the subject with some of\r\nthose simpler cases in which the differences between the young and\r\nadult insect are comparatively slight. We shall then be in a position to\r\nunderstand better the meaning of the more puzzling and complex cases in\r\nwhich the differences between the stages are profound.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is necessary to realise that the changes which any\r\ninsect passes through during its life-story are essentially\r\naccompaniments of its growth. The limits of this little book allow only\r\nslight reference to features of internal structure; we must be content,\r\nin the main, to deal with the outward form. But there is an important\r\nrelation between this outward form and the underlying living tissues\r\nwhich must be clearly understood. Throughout the great race of\r\nanimals--the Arthropoda--of which insects form a class, the body is\r\ncovered outwardly by a _cuticle_ or secretion of the underlying layer of\r\nliving cells which form the outer skin or _epidermis_[3] (see fig. 10\r\n_ep_, _cu_, p. 39). This cuticle has regions which are hard and firm,\r\nforming an _exoskeleton_, and, between these, areas which are relatively\r\nsoft and flexible. The firm regions are commonly segmental in their\r\narrangement, and the intervening flexible connections render possible\r\naccurate motions of the exoskeletal parts in relation to each other,\r\nthe motions being due to the contraction of muscles which are attached\r\nwithin the exoskeleton.\r\n\r\n[3] The term 'hypodermis' frequently applied to this layer is\r\nmisleading. The layer is the true outer skin--ectoderm or epidermis.\r\n\r\nNow this jointed exoskeleton--an admirably formed suit of armour though\r\nit often is--has one drawback: it is not part of the insect's living\r\ntissues. It is a cuticle formed by the solidifying of a fluid secreted\r\nby the epidermal cells, therefore without life, without the power of\r\ngrowth, and with only a limited capacity for stretching. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that at least during the period through which the insect\r\ncontinues to grow, the cuticle must be periodically shed. Thus in the\r\nlife-story of an insect or other arthropod, such as a lobster, a spider,\r\nor a centipede, there must be a succession of cuticle-castings--'moults'\r\nor _ecdyses_ as they are often called.\r\n\r\nWhen such a moult is about to take place the cuticle separates from the\r\nunderlying epidermis, and a fluid collects beneath. A delicate new\r\ncuticle (see fig. 10 _cu'_) is then formed in contact with the\r\nepidermis, and the old cuticle opens, usually with a slit lengthwise\r\nalong the back, to allow the insect in its new coat to emerge. At first\r\nthis new coat is thin and flabby, but after a period of exposure to the\r\nair it hardens and darkens, becoming a worthy and larger successor to\r\nthat which has been cast. The cuticle moreover is by no means wholly\r\nexternal. The greater part of the digestive canal and the whole\r\nair-tube system are formed by inpushings of the outer skin (ectoderm)\r\nand are consequently lined with an extension of the chitinous cuticle\r\nwhich is shed and renewed at every moult.\r\n\r\nIn all insects these successive moults tend to be associated with change\r\nof form, sometimes slight, sometimes very great. The new cuticle is\r\nrarely an exact reproduction of the old one, it exhibits some new\r\nfeatures, which are often indications of the insect's approach towards\r\nmaturity. Even in some of those interesting and primitive insects the\r\nBristle-tails (Thysanura) and Spring-tails (Collembola), in which wings\r\nare never developed, perceptible differences in the form and arrangement\r\nof the abdominal limbs can be traced through the successive stages, as\r\nR. Heymons (1906) and K.W. Verhoeff (1911) have shown for Machilis. But\r\nthe changes undergone by such insects are comparatively so slight, that\r\nthe creatures are often known as 'Ametabola' or insects without\r\ntransformation in the life-history. Now there are a considerable number\r\nof winged insects--cockroaches and grasshoppers for example--in which\r\nthe observable changes are also comparatively slight. We will sketch\r\nbriefly the main features of the life-story of such an insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Common Cockroach (_Blatta orientalis_). _a_,\r\nfemale; _b_, male; _c_, side view of female; _d_, young. After Marlatt,\r\n_Entom. Bull._ 4, _U.S. Dept. Agric._]\r\n\r\nThe young creature is hatched from the egg in a form closely resembling,\r\non the whole, that of its parent, so that the term 'miniature adult'\r\nsometimes applied to it, is not inappropriate. The baby cockroach (fig.\r\n4 _d_) is known by its flattened body, rounded prothorax, and stiff,\r\njointed tail-feelers or cercopods; the baby grasshopper by its strong,\r\nelongate hind-legs, adapted, like those of the adult, for vigorous\r\nleaping. During the growth of the insect to the adult state there may be\r\nfour or five moults, each preceded and succeeded by a characteristic\r\ninstar[4]. The first instar differs, however, from the adult in one\r\nconspicuous and noteworthy feature, it possesses no trace of wings. But\r\nafter the first or the second moult, definite wing-rudiments are visible\r\nin the form of outgrowths on the corners of the second and third\r\nthoracic segments. In each succeeding instar these rudiments become more\r\nprominent, and in the fourth or the fifth stage, they show a branching\r\narrangement of air-tubes, prefiguring the nervures of the adult's wing\r\n(fig. 5). After the last moult the wings are exposed, articulated to the\r\nsegments that bear them, and capable of motion. Having been formed\r\nbeneath the cuticle of the wing-rudiments of the penultimate instar, the\r\nwings are necessarily abbreviated and crumpled. But during the process\r\nof hardening of the cuticle, they rapidly increase in size, blood and\r\nair being forced through the nervures, so that the wings attaining their\r\nfull expanse and firmness, become suited for the function of flight.\r\n\r\n[4] The convenient term 'instar' has been proposed by Fischer and\r\nadvocated by Sharp (1895) for the form assumed by an insect during a\r\nstage of its life-story. Thus the creature as hatched from the egg is\r\nthe _first instar_, after the first moult it has become the _second\r\ninstar_, and so on, the number of moults being always one less than the\r\nnumber of instars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Nymph of Locust (_Schistocera americana_) with\r\ndistinct wing-rudiments. After Howard, _Insect Life_, vol. VII.]\r\n\r\nThe changes through which these insects pass are therefore largely\r\nconnected with the development of the wings. It is noteworthy that in an\r\nimmature cockroach the entire dorsal cuticle is hard and firm. In the\r\nadult, however, while the cuticle of the prothorax remains firm, that of\r\nthe two hinder thoracic and of all the abdominal segments is somewhat\r\nthin and delicate on the dorsal aspect. It needs not now to be\r\nresistant, because it is covered by the two firm forewings, which shield\r\nand protect it, except when the insect is flying. There are, indeed,\r\nslight changes in other structures not directly connected with the\r\nwings. In a young grasshopper, for example, the feelers are relatively\r\nstouter than in the adult, and the prothorax does not show the\r\nspecifically distinctive shape with its definite keels and furrows.\r\nChanges in the secondary sexual characters may also be noticed. For\r\ninstance, in an immature cockroach both male and female carry a pair of\r\njointed tail-feelers or cercopods on the tenth abdominal segment, and a\r\npair of unjointed limbs or stylets on the ninth. In the adult stage,\r\nboth sexes possess cercopods, but the males only have stylets, those of\r\nthe female disappearing at the final moult.\r\n\r\nReviewing the main features of the life-story of a grasshopper or\r\ncockroach, we notice that there is no marked or sudden change of form.\r\nThe newly-hatched insect resembles generally its parent, except that it\r\nhas no wings. Wing-rudiments appear, however, in an early instar as\r\nvisible outgrowths on the thoracic segments, and become larger after\r\neach moult. All through its various stages the immature insect--_nymph_\r\nas it is called--lives in the same kind of situations and on the same\r\nkind of food as its parent, and it is all along active and lively,\r\nundergoing no resting period like the pupal stage in the transformation\r\nof the butterfly.\r\n\r\nOne interesting and suggestive fact remains to be mentioned. There are\r\ngrasshoppers and cockroaches in which the changes are even less than\r\nthose just sketched, because the wings remain, even in the adult, in a\r\nrudimentary state (as for example in the female of the common kitchen\r\ncockroach, _Blatta orientalis_, see fig. 4 _a_), or are never developed\r\nat all. Such exceptional winglessness in members of a winged family can\r\nonly be explained by the recognition of a life-story, not merely in the\r\nindividual but in the race. We cannot doubt that the ancestors of these\r\nwingless insects possessed wings, which in the course of time have been\r\nlost by the whole species or by the members of the female sex. It is\r\ngenerally assumed that this loss has been gradual, and so in many cases\r\nit probably may have been. But there are species of insects in which\r\nsome generations are winged and others wingless; a winged mother gives\r\nbirth to wingless offspring, and a wingless parent to young with\r\nwell-developed wings. Such discontinuity in the life-story of a single\r\ngeneration forces us to recognise the possibility of similar sudden\r\nmutations in the course of that age-long process of evolution to which\r\nthe facts of insect growth, and indeed of all animal development, bear\r\nstriking testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE-STORIES OF SOME SUCKING INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may now turn our attention to some examples of the remarkable\r\nalternation of winged and wingless generations in the yearly life-cycle\r\nof the same species, mentioned at the end of the last chapter.\r\nCockroaches and grasshoppers belong to an order of insects, the\r\nOrthoptera[5], characterised by firm forewings and biting jaws; in all\r\nof them the change of form during the life-history is comparatively\r\nslight. A great contrast to those insects in the structure of the\r\nmouth-parts is presented by the Hemiptera, an order including the bugs,\r\npond-skaters, cicads, plant-lice, and scale-insects. These all have an\r\nelongated, grooved labium projecting from the head in form of a beak,\r\nwithin which work, to and fro, the slender needle-like mandibles and\r\nmaxillae by means of which the insect pierces holes through the skin of\r\na leaf or an animal, and is thus enabled to suck a meal of sap or blood,\r\naccording to its mode of life. In many Hemiptera--the various families\r\nof bugs both aquatic and terrestrial, for example--the life-history is\r\nnearly as simple as that of a cockroach. It is the family of the\r\nplant-lice (Aphidae) that affords typical illustrations of that\r\nalternation of generations to which reference has been made.\r\n\r\n[5] See outline classification of insects, p. 122.\r\n\r\nThe yearly cycle of the common Aphids of the apple tree has been lately\r\nworked out in detail by J.B. Smith (1900) and E.D. Sanderson (1902). In\r\nlate autumn tiny wingless males and females are found in large numbers\r\non the withered leaves. The sexes pair together, and the females lay\r\ntheir relatively large, smooth, hard-coated black eggs on the twigs;\r\nthese resistant eggs carry the species safely over the winter. At\r\nspringtide, when the leaves begin to sprout from the opening buds the\r\naphid eggs are hatched, and the young insects after a series of moults,\r\nthrough which hardly any change of form is apparent, all grow into\r\nwingless 'stem-mothers' much larger than the egg-laying females of the\r\nautumn. The stem-mothers have the power, unusual among animals as a\r\nwhole, but not very infrequent in the insects and their allies, of\r\nreproducing their kind without having paired[6] with a male. Eggs\r\ncapable of parthenogenetic development, produced in large numbers in the\r\novaries of these females, give rise to young which, developing within\r\nthe body of the mother, are born in an active state. Successive broods\r\nof these wingless virgin females (fig. 6 _a_) appear through the spring\r\nand summer months, and as the rate of their development is rapid, often\r\nthe whole life-story is completed within a week. The aphid population\r\nincreases very fast. Later a generation appears in which the thoracic\r\nsegments of the nymphs are seen to bear wing-rudiments like those of the\r\nyoung cockroach, and a host of winged females (fig. 6_b_) are produced;\r\nthese have the power of migrating to other plants. We understand that\r\nwings are not necessary to the earlier broods whose members have plenty\r\nof room and food on their native shoots, but that when the population\r\nbecomes crowded, a winged brood capable of emigration is advantageous to\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\n[6] Such virgin reproduction is termed 'parthenogenesis.'\r\n\r\nMany generations of virgin female aphids, some wingless, others winged\r\nwhen adult, succeed each other through the summer months. At the close\r\nof the year the latest brood of these bring forth young, which develop\r\ninto males and egg-laying females; thus the yearly cycle is completed.\r\nVariations in points of detail may be noticed in different species of\r\naphids. The autumn males and egg-laying females are, for example,\r\nfrequently winged, and the same species may have constantly recurring\r\ngenerations of different forms adapted for different food-plants, or for\r\ndifferent regions of the same food-plant. But taking a general view of\r\nthe life-story of aphids for comparison with the life-story of other\r\ninsects, three points are especially noteworthy. Virgin reproduction\r\nrecurs regularly, parthenogenetic broods being succeeded by a single\r\nsexual brood. A winged parent brings forth young which remain always\r\nwingless, and wingless adults produce young which acquire wings. The\r\nwings are developed, as in the cockroach, from outward and visible\r\nwing-rudiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Apple Aphid (_Aphis pomi_), virgin females, _a_,\r\nwingless; _b_, winged. Magnified 20 times.]\r\n\r\nA family of Hemiptera, related to the Aphidae and equally obnoxious to\r\nthe gardener, is that of the Coccidae or scale-insects. These furnish an\r\nexcellent illustration of features noticeable in certain insect\r\nlife-histories. In the first place, the newly-hatched young differs\r\nmarkedly from the parent in the details of its structure. A young coccid\r\n(fig. 7 _c_) is flattened oval in shape, has well-developed feelers\r\n(fig. 7 _d_) and legs, and runs actively about, usually on the leaves or\r\nbark of trees and shrubs, through which it pierces with its long jaws,\r\nso that it may suck sap from the soft tissues beneath. After a time it\r\nfixes itself by means of these jaws and the characteristic scale or\r\nprotective covering, composed partly of a waxy secretion and partly of\r\ndried excrement, begins to grow over its body. The female loses legs and\r\nfeelers, and never acquires wings, becoming little more than a sluggish\r\negg-bag (fig. 7 _e_). The male on the other hand passes into a second\r\nlarval stage in which there are no functional legs, but rudiments of\r\nlegs and of wings are present on the epidermis beneath the cuticle, as\r\nshown by B.O. Schmidt for Aspidiotus (1885). The penultimate instar of\r\nthis sex in which the wing-rudiments are visible externally lies\r\npassively beneath the scale, its behaviour resembling that of a\r\nbutterfly pupa. The adult winged male (fig. 7 _a_) leads a short, but\r\nactive life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Mussel Scale-insect (_Mytilaspis pomorum_). _a_,\r\nmale; _b_, foot of male; _c_, larva, ventral view; _d_, feeler of larva;\r\n_e_, female, ventral view. After Howard, _Yearbook U.S. Dept. Agric._\r\n1904. Magnified, _a, c, e_ x 20; _b, d_ x 120.]\r\n\r\nAnother family allied to the Aphidae is that of the Cicads, hardly\r\nrepresented in our fauna but abundant in many of the warmer regions of\r\nthe earth. Here also the young insect differs widely from its parent in\r\nform, living underground and being provided with strong fore-legs for\r\ndigging in the soil. After a long subterranean existence, usually\r\nextending over several years, the insect attains the penultimate stage\r\nof its life-story, during which it rests passively within an earthen\r\ncell, awaiting the final moult, which will usher in its winged and\r\nperfect state.\r\n\r\nIn the life-histories of cicads and coccids, then, there are some\r\nfeatures which recall those of the caterpillar's transformation into the\r\nbutterfly. The newly-hatched insect is externally so unlike its parent\r\nthat it may be styled a larva. The penultimate instar is quiescent and\r\ndoes not feed. But while the caterpillar shows throughout its life no\r\noutward trace of wings, external wing-rudiments are evident in the young\r\nstages of the cicad. In the male coccid we find a late larval stage with\r\nhidden wing-rudiments, the importance of which, for comparison with the\r\ncaterpillar, will be appreciated later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFROM WATER TO AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects as a whole are preeminently creatures of the land and the air.\r\nThis is shown not only by the possession of wings by a vast majority of\r\nthe class, but by the mode of breathing to which reference has already\r\nbeen made (p. 2), a system of branching air-tubes carrying atmospheric\r\nair with its combustion-supporting oxygen to all the insect's tissues.\r\nThe air gains access to these tubes through a number of paired air-holes\r\nor spiracles, arranged segmentally in series.\r\n\r\nIt is of great interest to find that, nevertheless, a number of insects\r\nspend much of their time under water. This is true of not a few in the\r\nperfect winged state, as for example aquatic beetles and water-bugs\r\n('boatmen' and 'scorpions') which have some way of protecting their\r\nspiracles when submerged, and, possessing usually the power of flight,\r\ncan pass on occasion from pond or stream to upper air. But it is\r\nadvisable in connection with our present subject to dwell especially on\r\nsome insects that remain continually under water till they are ready to\r\nundergo their final moult and attain the winged state, which they pass\r\nentirely in the air. The preparatory instars of such insects are\r\naquatic; the adult instar is aerial. All may-flies, dragon-flies, and\r\ncaddis-flies, many beetles and two-winged flies, and a few moths thus\r\ndivide their life-story between the water and the air. For the present\r\nwe confine attention to the Stone-flies, the May-flies, and the\r\nDragon-flies, three well-known orders of insects respectively called by\r\nsystematists the Plecoptera, the Ephemeroptera and the Odonata.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many insects that have aquatic larvae, the latter are\r\nprovided with some arrangement for enabling them to reach atmospheric\r\nair through the surface-film of the water. But the larva of a stone-fly,\r\na dragon-fly, or a may-fly is adapted more completely than these for\r\naquatic life; it can, by means of gills of some kind, breathe the air\r\ndissolved in water.\r\n\r\nThe aquatic young of a stone-fly does not differ sufficiently in form\r\nfrom its parent to warrant us in calling it a larva; the life-history is\r\nlike that of a cockroach, all the instars however except the final\r\none--the winged adult or _imago_--live in the water. The young of one of\r\nour large species, a Perla for example, has well-chitinised cuticle,\r\nbroad head, powerful legs, long feelers and cerci like those of the\r\nimago; its wings arise from external rudiments, which are conspicuous in\r\nthe later aquatic stages. But it lives completely submerged, usually\r\nclinging or walking beneath the stones that lie in the bed of a clear\r\nstream, and examination of the ventral aspect of the thorax reveals six\r\npairs of tufted gills, by means of which it is able to breathe the air\r\ndissolved in the water wherein it lives. At the base of the tail-feelers\r\nor cerci also, there are little tufts of thread-like gills as J.A.\r\nPalmén (1877) has shown. An insect that is continually submerged and has\r\nno contact with the upper air cannot breathe through a series of paired\r\nspiracles, and during the aquatic life-period of the stone-fly these\r\nremain closed. Nevertheless, breathing is carried on by means of the\r\nordinary system of branching air-tubes, the trunks of which are in\r\nconnection with the tufted hollow gill-filaments, through whose delicate\r\ncuticle gaseous exchange can take place, though the method of this\r\nexchange is as yet very imperfectly understood. When the stone-fly nymph\r\nis fully grown, it comes out of the water and climbs to some convenient\r\neminence. The cuticle splits open along the back, and the imago, clothed\r\nin its new cuticle, as yet soft and flexible, creeps out. The spiracles\r\nare now open, and the stone-fly breathes atmospheric air like other\r\nflying insects. But throughout its winged life, the stone-fly bears\r\nmemorials of its aquatic past in the little withered vestiges of gills\r\nthat can still be distinguished beneath the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe adult dragon-fly (fig. 8 _d_) is specialised in such a way that it\r\ncaptures its prey--flies and other small insects--on the wing, swooping\r\nthrough the air like a hawk and feeding voraciously. The head is\r\nremarkable for its large globular compound eyes, its short bristle-like\r\nfeelers, and its very strong mandibles which bite up the bodies of the\r\nvictims. The thorax bears the two pairs of ample wings, firm and almost\r\nglassy in texture, and its segments are projected forward ventrally, so\r\nthat all six legs, which are armed with rows of sharp, slender spines,\r\ncan be held in front of the mouth, where they form an effective\r\nfly-trap. The abdomen is very long and usually narrow.\r\n\r\nA female dragon-fly after a remarkable mode of pairing, the details of\r\nwhich are beside our present subject, drops her eggs in the water, or\r\nlays them on water-weeds, perhaps cutting an incision where they can be\r\nthe more safely lodged, or even goes down below the surface and deposits\r\nthem in the mud at the bottom of a pond. From the eggs are hatched the\r\naquatic larvae which differ in many respects from the imago. The\r\ndragon-fly larva has the same predaceous mode of life as its parent, but\r\nit is sluggish in habit, lurking for its prey at the bottom of the pond,\r\namong the mud or vegetation, which it resembles in colour. The thoracic\r\nsegments have not the specialisation that they show in the imago; the\r\nabdomen is relatively shorter and broader. The larval head has, like\r\nthat of the imago, short feelers, and the eyes are somewhat large,\r\nthough far from attaining the size of the great globular eyes of the\r\ndragon-fly. But the third pair of jaws, forming the labium, are most\r\nremarkably modified into a 'mask,' the distal central portion (mentum)\r\nbeing hinged to the basal piece (sub-mentum) which is itself jointed\r\nbelow the head. The mentum carries at its extremity a pair of lobes with\r\nsharp fangs. Thus the mask can be folded under the head when the larva\r\nlurks in its hiding place, or be suddenly darted out so as to secure any\r\nunwary small insect that may pass close enough for capture. Dragon-fly\r\nlarvae walk, and also swim by movements of the abdomen or by expelling a\r\njet of water from the hind-gut. The walls of this terminal region of the\r\nintestine have areas lined with delicate cuticle and traversed by\r\nnumerous air-tubes, so that gaseous exchange can take place between the\r\nair in the tubes and that dissolved in the water. The larvae of the\r\nlarger and heavier dragon-flies (Libellulidae and Aeschnidae) breathe\r\nmostly in this way. Those of the slender and delicate 'Demoiselles'\r\n(Agrionidae) are provided with three leaf-like gill-plates at the tail,\r\nbetween whose delicate surfaces numerous air-tubes ramify. These\r\ngill-plates are at times used for propulsion. Thus air supply is ensured\r\nduring aquatic life. But occasionally, when the water in which the\r\nlarva lives is foul and poor in oxygen, the tail is thrust out of the\r\nwater so that air can be admitted directly into the intestinal chamber.\r\nThe aquatic life of these insects lasts for more than a year, and F.\r\nBalfour-Browne (1909) has observed from ten to fourteen moults in\r\nAgrion. Outward wing-rudiments are early visible on the thoracic\r\nsegments; when these have become conspicuous the insect, beginning in\r\nsome respects to approach the adult condition, is often called a nymph.\r\nIn an advanced dragon-fly nymph, H. Dewitz (1891) has shown that the\r\nthoracic spiracles are open, and, as the time for its final moult draws\r\nnear, the insect may thrust the front part of its body out of the water,\r\nand breathe atmospheric air through these. Thus before the great change\r\ntakes place the nymph has foretastes of the aerial mode of breathing\r\nwhich it will practise when the perfect stage shall have been attained.\r\nThe emergence of the dragon-fly from its nymph-cuticle has been\r\ndescribed by many naturalists from de Réaumur (1740) to L.C. Miall\r\n(1895) and O.H. Latter (1904). The nymph climbs out of the water by\r\nascending some aquatic plant, and awaits the change so graphically\r\nsketched by Tennyson:\r\n\r\n    A hidden impulse rent the veil,\r\n    Of his old husk, from head to tail,\r\n    Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.\r\n\r\n'From head to tail,' for the nymph-cuticle splits lengthwise down the\r\nback, and the head and thorax of the imago are freed from it (fig. 8\r\n_a_), then the legs clasp the empty cuticle, and the abdomen is drawn\r\nout (fig. 8 _b, c_). After a short rest, the newly-emerged fly climbs\r\nyet higher up the water-weed, and remains for some hours with the\r\nabdomen bent concave dorsalwards (fig. 8 _d_), to allow space for the\r\nexpansion and hardening of the wings. For some days after emergence the\r\ncuticle of the dragon-fly has a dull pale hue, as compared with the dark\r\nor brightly metallic aspect that characterises it when fully mature. The\r\nlife of the imago endures but a short time compared with the long\r\naquatic larval and nymphal stages. After some weeks, or at most a few\r\nmonths, the dragon-flies, having paired and laid their eggs, die before\r\nthe approach of winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8 _a, b_. Dragon-fly (_Aeschna cyanea_). Two stages\r\nin emergence of fly from nymph-cuticle. From Latter's _Natural\r\nHistory_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8 _c_. Dragon-fly emerged, wings\r\nexpanding. From Latter's _Natural History_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8 _d_. Dragon-fly (_Aeschna cyanea_) with\r\nexpanded wings.]\r\n\r\nThe life-story of a may-fly follows the same general course as that just\r\ndescribed for the dragon-flies, but there are some suggestive\r\ndifferences. In the first place, we notice a wider divergence between\r\nthe imago and the larva. An adult may-fly is one of the most delicate\r\nof insects; the head has elaborate compound eyes, but the feelers are\r\nvery short, and the jaws are reduced to such tiny vestiges that the\r\ninsect is unable to feed. Its aquatic larva is fairly robust, with a\r\nlarge head which is provided with well-developed jaws, as the larval and\r\nnymphal stages extend over one or two years, and the insects browse on\r\nwater-weeds or devour creatures smaller and weaker than themselves. They\r\nbreathe dissolved air by means of thread-like or plate-like gills\r\ntraversed by branching air-tubes, somewhat resembling those of the\r\ndemoiselle dragon-fly larva. But in the may-fly larva, there is a series\r\nof these gills (fig. 9_b_) arranged laterally in pairs on the abdominal\r\nsegments, and C. Börner (1909) has recently given reasons, from the\r\nposition and muscular attachments of these organs, for believing that\r\nthey show a true correspondence to (in technical phraseology are\r\nhomologous with) the thoracic legs. One feature in which the larva often\r\nagrees with the imago is the possession on the terminal abdominal\r\nsegment of a pair of long jointed cerci, and in many genera a median\r\njointed tail-process (see fig. 9) is also present, in some cases both in\r\nthe larva and the imago, in others in the larva during its later stages\r\nonly. The prolonged larval life in may-flies often involves a large\r\nseries of moults; Lubbock (1863) has enumerated twenty-one in the\r\nlife-history of Chloeon. In the second year of aquatic life\r\nwing-rudiments (fig. 9 _a_) are visible, and the larva becomes a nymph.\r\nWhen the time for the winged condition approaches the nymphs leave the\r\nwater in large swarms. The vivid accounts of these swarms given by\r\nSwammerdam (1675), de Réaumur (1742) and other old-time observers are\r\navailable in summarised form for English readers in Miall's admirable\r\nbook (1895). May-flies are eagerly sought as food by trout, and the rise\r\nof the fly on many lakes ushers in a welcome season to the angler.\r\n\r\nThe nymph-cuticle opens and the winged insect emerges. But this is not\r\nthe final instar; may-flies are exceptional among insects in undergoing\r\nyet another moult after they have acquired wings which they can use for\r\nflight. The instar that emerges from the nymph-cuticle is a sub-imago,\r\ndull in hue, with a curious immature aspect about it. A few hours later\r\nthe final moult takes place, a very delicate cuticle being shed and\r\nrevealing the true imago. Then follow the dancing flight over the calm\r\nwaters, the mating and egg-laying, the rapid death. The whole winged\r\nexistence prepared for by the long aquatic life may be over in a single\r\nevening; at most it lasts but for a few days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Nymph of May-fly (_Chloeon dipterum_) showing on\r\nright side wing-rudiment (_a_), on left tracheal gills (_b_). Magnified\r\n4 times. [Feelers and legs are cut short.] From Miall and Denny after\r\nVayssière.]\r\n\r\nIn the development of the may-flies, then, we notice not only a\r\nconsiderable divergence between larva and imago, both in habitat and\r\nstructure; we see also what is to be observed often in more highly\r\norganised insects--a feeding stage prolonged through the years of larval\r\nand nymphal life, while the winged imago takes no food and devotes its\r\nenergies through its short existence to the task of reproduction. Such\r\ndivision of the life-history into a long feeding, and a short breeding\r\nperiod has, as will be seen later, an important bearing on the question\r\nof insect transformation generally, and the dragon-flies and may-flies\r\nafford examples of two stages in its specialisation. The sub-imaginal\r\ninstar of the may-fly furnishes also a noteworthy fact for comparison\r\nwith other insect histories. In two points, however, the life-story of\r\nthese flies with their aquatic larvae recalls that of the cockroach. All\r\nthe larval and nymphal instars are active, and the wing-rudiments are\r\noutwardly visible long before the final moult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTRANSFORMATIONS,--OUTWARD AND INWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to study in some detail the transformation of\r\nthose insects whose life-story corresponds more or less closely with\r\nthat of the butterfly, sketched in the opening pages of this little\r\nbook. In the case of some of the insects reviewed in the last three\r\nchapters, the may-flies and cicads for example, a marked difference\r\nbetween the larva and the imago has been noticed; in others, as the\r\ncoccids, we find a resting instar before the winged condition is\r\nassumed, suggesting the pupal stage in the butterfly's life-story.\r\n\r\nThe various insect orders whose members exhibit no marked divergence\r\nbetween larva and imago (the Orthoptera for example) are often said to\r\nundergo no transformation, to be 'Ametabola.' Those with life-stories\r\nsuch as the dragon-flies' are said to undergo partial transformation,\r\nand are termed 'Hemimetabola.' Moths, caddis-flies, beetles, two-winged\r\nflies, saw-flies, ants, wasps, bees, and the great majority of insects,\r\nhaving the same type of life-story as the butterfly, are said to undergo\r\ncomplete transformation and are classed as 'Metabola' or 'Holometabola.'\r\nWherein lies the fundamental difference between these Holometabola on\r\nthe one hand and the Hemimetabola and Ametabola on the other? It is not\r\nthat the larva differs from the imago or that there is a passive stage\r\nin the life-history; these conditions are observable among insects with\r\na 'partial' transformation as we have seen, though the resting instar\r\nthat simulates the butterfly pupa is certainly exceptional. It has been\r\npointed out by Sharp (1899) that the most important indication of the\r\ndifference between the two modes of development is furnished by the\r\nposition of the wing-rudiments. In all Ametabola and Hemimetabola these\r\nare visible externally long before the penultimate instar has been\r\nreached; in the Holometabola they are not seen until the pupal stage.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been drawn to the contrast in outward form between\r\na butterfly and its caterpillar. As in the case of dragon-fly or\r\nmay-fly, the larval period is essentially a time for feeding and growth,\r\nand during this period the larval cuticle is cast four or five, in some\r\nspecies even seven or eight times. After each moult some changes in\r\ndetail may be observable, for example in the proportions of the\r\nbody-segments or their outgrowths, in the colour or the closeness of the\r\nhairy or spiny armature. But in all main features the caterpillar\r\nretains throughout its life the characteristic form in which it left\r\nthe egg. From the tiny, newly-hatched larva to the full-fed caterpillar,\r\npossibly several inches in length, there is all along the same crawling,\r\nsomewhat worm-like body, destitute of any outward trace of wings. When\r\nhowever the last larval cuticle has split open lengthwise along the\r\nback, and has been worked off by vigorous wriggling motions of the\r\ninsect, the pupa thus revealed shows the wing-rudiments conspicuous at\r\nthe sides of the body, and lying neatly alongside these are to be seen\r\nthe forms of feelers, legs, and maxillae of the imago prefigured in the\r\ncuticle of the pupa (fig. 1 _e_). The pupa thus resembles the imago much\r\nmore closely than it resembles the larva; even in the proportions of the\r\nbody a relative shortening is to be noticed, and the imago of any insect\r\nwith complete transformation is reduced in length as compared with the\r\nfull-fed larva. Now these wings and other structures characteristic of\r\nthe imago, appear in the pupa which is revealed by the shedding of the\r\nlast larval cuticle. From these facts we infer that the wing-rudiments\r\nmust be present in the larva, hidden beneath the cuticle; and until the\r\nlast larval instar, not beneath the cuticle only, but growing in\r\nsuch-wise that they are hidden by the epidermis. For if they were\r\ngrowing outwardly the new cuticle would be formed over them, so that\r\nthey would be apparent after the next moult. But it is clear that only\r\nin the pupa, forming beneath the cuticle of the last larval instar, can\r\nthey grow outwards.\r\n\r\nAnatomical study of the caterpillar at various stages verifies the\r\nconclusions just drawn from superficial observation. A hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago P. Lyonet in his monumental work (1762) on the caterpillar of\r\nthe Goat Moth (Cossus) detected, in the second and third thoracic\r\nsegments, four little white masses buried in the fat-body, and, while\r\ndoubtful as to their real meaning, he suggested that their number and\r\nposition might well give rise to the suspicion that they were rudiments\r\nof the wings of the moth. But it was a century later that A. Weismann in\r\nhis classical studies (1864) on the development of common flies, showed\r\nthe presence in the maggot of definite rudiments of wings, and other\r\norgans of the adult--rudiments to which he gave the name of _imaginal\r\ndiscs_. We will recur later to these transformations of the Diptera. For\r\nthe present, we pursue our survey of changes in the life-history of the\r\nLepidoptera and can take to guide us the excellent researches of J.\r\nGonin (1894).\r\n\r\nCareful study of the imaginal discs of the wings in a caterpillar (fig.\r\n10) made by examining microscopically sections cut through them, shows\r\nthat the epidermis is pushed in to form a little pouch (_C, p_) and that\r\ninto this grows the actual wing-rudiment. Consequently the whitish disk\r\nwhich seems to lie within the body-wall of the larva, is really a\r\ndouble fold of the epidermis, the outer fold forming the pouch, the\r\ninner the actual wing-bud. Into the cavity of the latter pass branches\r\nfrom the air-tube system. In its earliest stage, the wing-bud is simply\r\nan ingrowing mass of cells (fig. 10 _A_) which subsequently becomes an\r\ninpushed pouch (_B_). Until the last stage of larval life the wing-bud\r\nremains hidden in its pouch, and no cuticle is formed over it. When the\r\npupal stage draws near the bud grows out of its sheath, and projecting\r\nfrom the general surface of the epidermis becomes covered with cuticle\r\nto be revealed, as we have seen, after the last larval moult, as the\r\npupal wing. Thus all through the life of the humble, crawling\r\ncaterpillar, 'it doth not yet appear what it shall be,' but there are\r\nbeing prepared, hidden and unseen, the wondrous organs of flight, which\r\nin due time will equip the insect for the glorious aerial existence that\r\nawaits it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. A, B, C, Sections through epidermis and cuticle,\r\nshowing three stages in growth of the imaginal disc (_w_) of a wing in\r\nthe caterpillar of a White Butterfly (_Pieris_). _ep_, epidermis; _cu_,\r\ncuticle; _t_, air-tube, whence branches pass into the developing wing.\r\nIn C, _cu'_ represents the new cuticle forming beneath the old one, and\r\n(_p_) the pouch within which the wing-disc (_w_) lies. Highly magnified.\r\nAfter Gonin, _Bull. Soc. Vaud._ XXX.]\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this hidden growth of the wing-rudiments, in\r\nbutterflies, beetles, flies, bees, and the great majority of the winged\r\ninsects, has been emphasised by Sharp (1899) as a character contrasting\r\nmarkedly with the outward and visible growth of the wing-rudiments in\r\nsuch insects as cockroaches, bugs, and dragon-flies. The divergence\r\nbetween the two modes of development is certainly very striking, and a\r\nconceivable method of transition from the one to the other is not easy\r\nto explain. Sharp has expressed the divergence by the terms\r\n_Endopterygota_, applied to all the orders of insects with hidden\r\nwing-rudiments (the 'Metabola' or 'Holometabola' of most\r\nclassifications) and _Exopterygota_, including all those insects whose\r\nwing-rudiments are visible throughout growth ('Hemimetabola' and\r\n'Ametabola'). Those curious lowly insects, belonging to the two orders\r\nof the Collembola and Thysanura, none of whose members ever develop\r\nwings at all, form a third sub-class, the _Apterygota_ (see\r\nClassificatory Table, p. 122).\r\n\r\nNot the wings only, but other structures of the imago, varying in extent\r\nin different orders, are formed from the imaginal discs. For example, de\r\nRéaumur and G. Newport (1839) found that if the thoracic leg of a\r\nlate-stage caterpillar were cut off, the corresponding leg of the\r\nresulting butterfly would still be developed, although in a truncated\r\ncondition. Gonin has shown that in the Cabbage White butterfly (_Pieris\r\nbrassicae_) the legs of the imago are represented, through the greater\r\npart of larval life, only by small groups of cells situated within the\r\nbases of the larval legs. After the third moult these imaginal discs\r\ngrow rapidly and the proximal portion of each, destined to develop into\r\nthe thigh and shin of the butterfly's leg, sinks into a depression at\r\nthe side of the thorax, while the tip of the shin and the\r\nfive-segmented foot project into the cavity of the larval leg. Hence we\r\nunderstand that the amputation of the latter by the old naturalists\r\ntruncated only and did not destroy the imaginal limb. In the blow-fly\r\nmaggot, Weismann, B.T. Lowne (1890) and J. Van Rees (1888) have shown\r\nthat the imaginal discs of the legs (fig. 11--1, 2, 3) grow out from\r\ndeep dermal inpushings. Simple at first, these outgrowths by partial\r\nsplitting, become differentiated into thigh and shin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Front region of Maggot of Blow-fly\r\n(_Calliphora_) showing diagrammatically the imaginal discs, which are\r\nshaded. _e_, eye; _f_, feeler; _W_, fore-wing; _w_, hind-wing; 1, 2, 3,\r\nlegs. _H_ is the 'cephalic vesicle,' which becomes everted at the close\r\nof the metamorphosis, so as to bring the feelers and eyes to the front,\r\nthe brain (_B_) moving forwards at the same time. After Van Rees, _Zool.\r\nJahrb._ 1894, and Lowne's _Blow-fly_.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly the feelers and jaws of the butterfly are developed from\r\nimaginal discs, and this fact explains how it comes to pass that they\r\ndiffer so widely from the corresponding structures in the caterpillar.\r\nThe larval feelers (fig. 3 _At_) are short and stumpy, those of the\r\nbutterfly long and many-jointed. The maxilla of the larva (fig. 3 _Mx_)\r\nconsists of a base carrying two short jointed processes; in the\r\nbutterfly a certain portion of the maxilla, the hood or galea, is\r\nmodified into a long, flexible grooved process, capable of forming with\r\nits fellow the trunk through which the insect sucks its liquid food\r\n(fig. 2). Nothing but some such provision as that of the imaginal discs\r\ncould render possible the wonderful replacement of the caterpillar's\r\njaws, biting solid food, into those of the butterfly sipping nectar from\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nA curious segmental displacement of the imaginal discs with regard to\r\nthe larva is noticeable in some Diptera. In the larva of the\r\nharlequin-midge (Chironomus) as described by Miall and Hammond (1900)\r\nthe brain is situated in the thorax, and the imaginal discs for the\r\nhead, eyes, and feelers of the adult lie in close association with it,\r\nthough they arise from inpushings of the larval head. These rudiments do\r\nnot appear until the last larval stage has been reached. In the gnats\r\nCulex and Corethra, on the other hand, the imaginal discs for the\r\nhead-appendages retain their normal position within the larval head, and\r\nappear in an early stage of larval life. Among the flies of the\r\nbluebottle group (Muscidae) the brain (fig. 11 _B_) is situated, as in\r\nChironomus, in the thoracic region of the legless maggot, which is the\r\nlarva of an insect of this family, and the imaginal discs for eyes and\r\nfeelers (fig. 11 _e_, _f_) lie just in front of it. Here, the imaginal\r\nbuds of the legs (fig. 11--1, 2, 3) and wings (fig. 11 _W_, _w_) are\r\ndeeply inpushed, retaining their connection with the skin only by means\r\nof a thread of cells. As the larva is legless and headless its outer\r\nform is not affected by the discs and it is not surprising to learn that\r\nthey appear early. It has indeed been suggested that the pharyngeal\r\nregion of the larva, in connection with which the imaginal head-discs\r\nare developed, should be regarded, though it lies in the thorax, as an\r\ninpushed anterior section of the larval head. In any case this region is\r\npushed out during the formation of the pupa within the final larval\r\ncuticle, so that the imaginal head with its contained brain, its\r\ncompound eyes, and its complex feelers, takes its rightful place at the\r\nfront end of the insect.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the brain suggests a few brief remarks on the changes in\r\nthe internal organs during insect transformation. There are no imaginal\r\ndiscs for the nervous system; the brain, nerve-cords and ganglia of the\r\nbutterfly or bluebottle are the direct outcome of those of the\r\ncaterpillar or maggot. More than seventy years ago, Newport (1839)\r\ntraced the rapid but continuous changes, which, during the early pupal\r\nperiod, convert the elongate nerve-cord of the caterpillar with its\r\nrelatively far-separated ganglia into the shortened, condensed\r\nnerve-cord of the Tortoise-shell butterfly (_Vanessa urticae_) with\r\nseveral of the ganglia coalesced. In many Diptera, on the other hand,\r\nthe nervous system of the larva is more concentrated than that of the\r\nimago.\r\n\r\nThe tubular heart also of a winged insect is the directly modified\r\nsurvival of the larval heart.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the reproductive organs undergo a gradual, continuous\r\ndevelopment throughout an insect's life-story. Their rudiments appear in\r\nthe embryo, often at a very early stage; they are recognisable in the\r\nlarva, and the matured structures in the imago are the result of their\r\nslow process of growth, the details of which must be reckoned beyond the\r\nscope of this book. For a full summary of the subject the reader is\r\nreferred to L.F. Henneguy's work (1904) containing references to much\r\nimportant modern literature, which cannot be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the digestive system of insects that undergo a\r\nmetamorphosis, passes through a profound crisis of dissolution and\r\nrebuilding. This is not surprising when we remember that there is often\r\na great difference between larva and imago in the nature of the food.\r\nThe digestive canal of a caterpillar runs a fairly straight course\r\nthrough the body and consists of a gullet, stomach (mid-gut),\r\nintestine, and rectum; it is adapted for the digestion of solid food. In\r\nthe butterfly there is one outgrowth of the gullet in the head--a\r\npharyngeal sac adapted for sucking liquids; and another outgrowth at the\r\nhinder end of the gullet (which is much longer than in the larva)--a\r\ncrop or food-reservoir lying in the abdomen. The intestine of the\r\nbutterfly also is longer than that of the larva, being coiled or\r\ntwisted. Towards the end of the last larval stage, the cells of the\r\ninner coat (epithelium) lining the stomach begin to undergo\r\ndegeneration, small replacing cells appearing between their bases and\r\nlater giving rise to the more delicate epithelium that lines the mid-gut\r\nof the imago. The larval cells are shed into the cavity of the stomach\r\nand become completely broken down. J. Anglas (1902), describing these\r\nmicroscopic changes in the transformations of wasps and bees, has shown\r\nthat the tiny replacing cells can be recognised in sections through the\r\ndigestive canal of a very young larva; they may be regarded as\r\nrepresenting imaginal buds of the adult gastric epithelium. In the\r\ntransformations of two-winged flies of the bluebottle group, A.\r\nKowalevsky (1887) has shown that these replacing cells are aggregated in\r\nlittle masses scattered at different points along the stomach and thus\r\ncorresponding rather closely to the imaginal discs of the legs and\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe gullet, crop, and gizzard of an insect, which lie in front of the\r\nstomach, are lined by cells derived from the outer skin (ectoderm) which\r\nis pushed in to form what is called the 'fore-gut.' Similarly the\r\nintestine and rectum, behind the stomach, are lined with ectodermal\r\ncells which arise from the inpushed 'hind-gut.' The larval fore- and\r\nhind-guts are broken down at the end of larval life and their lining is\r\nreplaced by fresh tissue derived from two imaginal bands which surround\r\nthe cavity of the digestive tube, one at the hinder end of the fore-gut,\r\nand the other at the front end of the hind-gut. The larval salivary\r\nglands in connection with the gullet are also broken down, and fresh\r\nglands are formed for the imago.\r\n\r\nA large part of the substance of an insect larva consists of muscular\r\ntissue, surrounding the digestive tube, and forming the great muscles\r\nthat move the various parts of the body, and of fat, surrounding the\r\norgans and serving as a store of food-material. Very many of the\r\nmuscle-fibres and the fat-cells also become disintegrated during the\r\nlate larval and pupal stages, and the corresponding tissues of the adult\r\nare new formations derived from special groups of imaginal cells, though\r\nsome muscles may persist from the larva to the adult. Similarly the\r\ncomplex air-tube or tracheal system of the larva is broken down and a\r\nfresh set of tubes is developed, adapted to the altered body-form of\r\npupa and imago.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of larval tissue and the development of replacing organs\r\nfrom special groups of cells, derived of course from the embryo, and\r\ncarrying on the continuity of cell-lineage to the adult, are among the\r\nmost remarkable facts connected with the life-story of insects. The\r\nprocess of tissue-destruction is known as 'histolysis'; the rebuilding\r\nprocess is called 'histogenesis.' Considerable difference of opinion has\r\nexisted as to factors causing histolysis, and for a summary of the\r\nconflicting or complementary theories, the reader is referred to the\r\nwork of L.F. Henneguy (1904, pp. 677-684). In the histolysis of the\r\ntwo-winged flies, wandering amoeboid cells--like the white corpuscles or\r\nleucocytes of vertebrate blood--have been observed destroying the larval\r\ntissues that need to be broken down, as they destroy invading\r\nmicro-organisms in the body. But students of the internal changes that\r\naccompany transformation in insects of other orders have often been\r\nunable to observe such devouring activity of these 'phagocytes,' and\r\nattribute the dissolution of the larval tissues to internal chemical\r\nchanges. The fact that in all insect transformation a part, and in many\r\na large part, of the larval organs pass over to the pupa and imago,\r\nsuggests that only those structures whose work is done are broken down\r\nthrough the action of internally formed destructive substances, and one\r\nfunction of the phagocytes is to act as scavengers by devouring what has\r\nbecome effete and useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLARVAE AND THEIR ADAPTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the insects that undergo a complete transformation, there is, as\r\nwe have seen in the preceding chapter, an amount of inward change, of\r\ndissolution and rebuilding of tissues, that varies in its completeness\r\nin members of different orders. It is now advisable to consider the\r\nvarious outward forms assumed by the larvae of these insects, or rather\r\nby a few examples chosen from a vast array of well-nigh 'infinite\r\nvariety.'\r\n\r\nIn comparing the transformations of endopterygote insects of different\r\norders, it is worthy of notice that in some cases all the members of an\r\norder have larvae remarkably constant in their main structural features,\r\nwhile in others there is great variety of larval form within the order.\r\nFor example, the caterpillars of all Lepidoptera are fundamentally much\r\nalike, while the grubs of beetles of different families diverge widely\r\nfrom one another. A review of a selected series of beetle-larvae will\r\ntherefore serve well to introduce this branch of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. _a_, Carrion-beetle (_Silpha_) with its larva,\r\n_b_. Magnified, _a_ 3 times, and _b_ 4 times.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Larva of a Ground-beetle (_Aepus_). Magnified\r\n6 times. After Westwood, _Modern Classification of Insects_.]\r\n\r\nBeetles are as a rule remarkable among insects for the firm consistency\r\nof their chitinous cuticle, the various pieces (_sclerites_) of which\r\nare fitted together with admirable precision. In some families of\r\nbeetles the larva also is furnished with a complete chitinous armour,\r\nthe sclerites, both dorsal and ventral, of the successive body-segments\r\nbeing hard and firm, while the relatively long legs possess well-defined\r\nsegments and are often spiny. Such a larva is evidently far less unlike\r\nits parent beetle than a caterpillar is unlike a butterfly. Perhaps of\r\nall beetle larvae, the woodlouse-like grub (fig. 12 _b_) of a\r\ncarrion-beetle (Silpha) or of a semi-aquatic dascillid such as Helodes\r\nshows the least amount of difference from the typical adult, on account\r\nof the conspicuous jointed feelers. The larval glow-worm, however, is of\r\nthe same woodlouse-like aspect, and in this case, where the female never\r\nacquires wings, but becomes mature in a form which does not differ\r\nmarkedly from that of the larva, the exceptional resemblance is closer\r\nstill. In all beetle-grubs the legs are simplified, there being only one\r\nsegment (a combined shin and foot) below the knee-joint, whereas in the\r\nadult there is a shin followed by five, four, or at least three\r\ndistinct tarsal segments. The foot of an adult beetle bears two claws\r\nat its tip, while the larval foot in the great majority of families has\r\nonly one claw. In one section of the order, however, the Adephaga\r\ncomprising the predaceous terrestrial and aquatic beetles, the larval\r\nfoot has, like that of the adult, two claws. Some adephagous larvae,\r\nnotably those of the large carnivorous water-beetles (Dyticus), often\r\ndestructive to tadpoles and young fish, have completely armoured bodies\r\nas well as long jointed legs. More commonly, as with most of the\r\nwell-known Ground-beetles (Carabidae), the cuticle is less consistently\r\nhard, firm sclerites segmentally arranged alternating with considerable\r\ntracts of cuticle which remain feebly chitinised and flexible. Most of\r\nthe adephagous larvae (fig. 13) have a pair of stiff processes on the\r\nninth abdominal segment, and the insect, from its general likeness to a\r\nbristle-tail of the genus Campodea, is often called a _campodeiform_\r\nlarva (Brauer, 1869). From such as these, a series of forms can be\r\ntraced among larvae of beetles, showing an increasing divergence from\r\nthe imago. The well-known wireworms--grubs of the Click-beetles\r\n(Elateridae)--that eat the roots of farm crops, have well-armoured\r\nbodies, but their shape is elongate, cylindrical, worm-like; and their\r\nlegs are relatively short, the build of the insect being adapted for\r\nrapid motion through the soil. The grubs of the Chafers (Scarabaeidae)\r\nare also root-eaters, but they are less active in their habits than the\r\nwireworms, and the cuticle of their somewhat stout bodies is, for the\r\nmost part, pale and flexible; only the head and legs are hard and horny.\r\nUsually an evident correspondence can be traced between the outward form\r\nof any larva and its mode of life. For example, in the family of the\r\nLeaf-beetles (Chrysomelidae) some larvae feed openly on the foliage of\r\ntrees or herbs, while others burrow into the plant tissues. The exposed\r\nlarvae of the Willow-beetles (Phyllodecta, fig. 14) have their somewhat\r\nabbreviated body segments protected by numerous spine-bearing, firm\r\ntubercles. But the grub of the 'Turnip Fly' (Phyllotreta) which feeds\r\nbetween the upper and lower skins of a leaf, or of _Psylliodes\r\nchrysocephala_ (fig. 15), which burrows in stalks, has a pale, soft\r\ncuticle like that of a caterpillar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. (_a_) Willow-beetle (_Phyllodecta vulgatissima_)\r\nand its larva (_b_). Magnified 5 times. After Carpenter, _Econ. Proc. R.\r\nDublin Soc_. vol. I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. (_a_) Cabbage-beetle (_Psylliodes chrysocephala_)\r\nmagnified 5 times, and its larva (_b_) magnified 12 times.]\r\n\r\nIn the larvae of the little timber-beetles and their allies (Ptinidae),\r\nincluding the 'death-watches' whose tapping in old furniture is often\r\nheard, a marked shortening of the legs and reduction in the size of the\r\nhead accompany the whitening and softening of the cuticle. This\r\nshortening of the legs is still more marked in the larvae of the\r\nLonghorn Beetles (Cerambycidae) burrowing in the wood of trees or felled\r\ntrunks; here the legs are reduced to small vestiges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. _a_, Grain Weevil (_Calandra granaria_); _b_,\r\nlarva; _c_, pupa. Magnified 7 times. After Chittenden, _Yearbook U.S.\r\nDept. Agric._ 1894.]\r\n\r\nFinally in the large family of the Weevils (Curculionidae, fig. 16) and\r\nthe Bark-beetles (Scolytidae), the grubs, eating underground root or\r\nstem structures, mining in leaves or seeds, or tunnelling beneath the\r\nbark of trees, have no legs at all, the place of these limbs being\r\nindicated only by tiny tubercles on the thoracic segments. Such larvae\r\nas these latter are examples of the type called _eruciform_ by A.S.\r\nPackard (1898) who as well as other writers has laid stress on the\r\nseries of transitional steps from the campodeiform to the eruciform type\r\nafforded by the larvae of the Coleoptera.\r\n\r\nA fact of much importance in the transformations of beetles as pointed\r\nout by Brauer (1869) is that in a few families, the first larval instar\r\nis campodeiform, while the subsequent instars are eruciform. We may take\r\nas an example of such 'hypermetamorphosis' the life-story of the Oil or\r\nBlister-beetles (Meloidae) as first described by J.H. Fabre (1857), and\r\nlater with more elaboration by H. Beaurégard (1890). From the egg of one\r\nof these beetles is hatched a minute armoured larva, with long feelers,\r\nlegs, and cerci, whose task is, for example, to seize hold of a bee in\r\norder that the latter may carry it, an uninvited guest, to her nest.\r\nSafely within the nest, the little 'triungulin' beetle-grub moults; the\r\nsecond instar has a soft cuticle and relatively shorter legs, which, as\r\nthe larva, now living as a cuckoo-parasite, proceeds to gorge itself\r\nwith honey, soon appear still further abbreviated. Later comes a stage\r\nduring which legs are entirely wanting, the larva then resting and\r\ntaking no food. The last larval instar again has short legs like the\r\ngrub of the second period. In connection with this life-history we\r\nnotice that the newly-hatched larva is not in the neighbourhood of its\r\nappropriate food. Hence the preliminary armoured and active instar is\r\nnecessary in order to reach the feeding place; this journey\r\naccomplished, the eruciform condition is at once assumed.\r\n\r\nIn all cases indeed we may say that the particular larval form is\r\nadapted to the special conditions of life. A few examples from other\r\norders of endopterygote insects will illustrate this point. The\r\ncampodeiform type is relatively unusual, but most of the Neuroptera have\r\nlarvae of this kind, active, armoured creatures with long legs, though\r\ndevoid of the tail-processes often associated with similar larvae among\r\nthe Coleoptera. Such are the 'Ant-lions,' larvae of the exotic lacewing\r\nflies, which hunt small insects, digging a sandy pit for their unwary\r\nsteps in the case of the best-known members of the group, some of which\r\nare found as far north as Paris. In our own islands the 'Aphis-lions,'\r\nlarvae of Hemerobius and Chrysopa, prowl on plants infested with\r\n'green-fly' which they impale on their sharp grooved mandibles, sucking\r\nout the victims' juices, and then, in some cases, using the dried\r\ncuticle to furnish a clothing for their own bodies. Among these insects,\r\nwhile the mouth of the imago is of the normal mandibulate type adapted\r\nfor eating solid food, the larval mouth is constricted and the slender\r\nmandibles are grooved for the transmission of liquid food.\r\n\r\nTurning to eruciform types of larva, we find the _caterpillar_ (fig. 1\r\n_b_, _c_, _d_) distinguished by its elongate, usually cylindrical body\r\nwith feeble cuticle, short thoracic legs and a variable number of pairs\r\nof abdominal pro-legs, universal among the moths and butterflies forming\r\nthe great order Lepidoptera, and usual among the saw-flies, which belong\r\nto the Hymenoptera. The vast majority of caterpillars feed on the leaves\r\nof plants and their long worm-like bodies with the series of paired\r\npro-legs, are excellently adapted for their habit of clinging to twigs,\r\nand crawling along shoots or the edges of leaves as they go in search of\r\nfood. Of great importance to a caterpillar is its power of spinning\r\nsilk, consisting of fine threads solidified from the secretion of\r\nspecially modified salivary glands whose ducts open in the insect's\r\nmouth at the tip of the tubular tongue which forms a spinneret.\r\n\r\nOn the same bush caterpillars of moths and of saw-flies may often be\r\nseen feeding together. The lepidopterous caterpillar, in our countries\r\nat least, has never more than five pairs of pro-legs, situated on the\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, sixth, and tenth abdominal segments; each of these\r\npro-legs bears a number of minute hooklets, arranged in a circular or\r\ncrescentic pattern, which assist the caterpillar in clinging to its\r\nfood-plant. The saw-fly caterpillar, on the other hand, may have as many\r\nas eight pairs of pro-legs, the series beginning on the second abdominal\r\nsegment; here, however, the pro-legs have no hooklets. Among the\r\nLepidoptera, we notice a reduction in the number of pro-legs in the\r\n'looper' caterpillars of Geometrid moths. Here only two pairs are\r\npresent, those on the sixth and tenth abdominal segments. Consequently,\r\nas the caterpillar can cling only by the thorax and by the hinder region\r\nof the abdomen, the middle region of the body is first straightened out\r\nand then bent into an arch-like form, as the insect makes its progress\r\nby alternate movements of stretching and 'looping.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. _c_, Ruby Tiger Moth (_Phragmatobia\r\nfuliginosa_); _a_, caterpillar; _b_, cocoon. After Lugger, _Insect\r\nLife_, vol. II.]\r\n\r\nCaterpillars, with their relatively soft bodies, feeding openly on the\r\nleaves of plants, are exposed to the attacks of many enemies, and the\r\nvarious ways in which they obtain protection are well worth studying. A\r\nclothing of hairs[7] or spines is often present, and it is interesting\r\nto find that many species of our native Tiger and Eggar Moths (Arctiadae\r\nand Lasiocampidae) which pass the winter in the larval stage, have\r\ncaterpillars with an especially dense hairy covering (fig. 17).\r\nExperiments have shown that hairy and spiny insects are distasteful to\r\nbirds and other creatures that prey readily on smooth-skinned species, a\r\nconclusion that might well have been expected. Certain smooth\r\ncaterpillars however appear to be protected by producing some nauseous\r\nsecretion, which renders them unpalatable. Many of these, as the\r\nfamiliar cream yellow and black larva of the Magpie Moth (_Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata_), are very conspicuously adorned, and furnish examples of\r\nwhat is known as 'warning coloration,' on the supposition that the gaudy\r\naspect of such insects serves as an advertisement that they are not fit\r\nto eat, and that birds and other possible devourers thus learn to leave\r\nthem alone. On the other hand, smooth caterpillars which are readily\r\neaten by birds are usually 'protectively' coloured, so as to resemble\r\ntheir surroundings and remain hidden except to careful seekers. Many\r\nsuch caterpillars are green, the upper surface, which is naturally\r\nexposed to the light, being darker than the lower which is in shadow.\r\nWhen the caterpillar is large, the green area is often broken up by pale\r\nlines, longitudinal as on the larvae of many Owl Moths (Noctuidae) or\r\noblique, as on the great caterpillars of most Hawk Moths (Sphingidae).\r\nSuch an arrangement tends to make the insect less easily seen than were\r\nit to display a continuous area of the same colour. The 'looper'\r\ncaterpillars mentioned above afford remarkable examples of 'protective'\r\nresemblance, for many of them show a marvellous likeness to the twigs of\r\ntheir food-plant, tubercles on the insect's body resembling closely the\r\nlittle outgrowths of the plant's cortex. It has been shown by E.B.\r\nPoulton (1892) that many caterpillars are, in their early stages,\r\ndirectly responsive to their surroundings as regards colour. Usually\r\ngreen when hatched, they remain green if kept among leaves or young\r\nshoots of plants, while they turn red, brown, or blackish if placed\r\namong twigs of these respective hues. This effect appears to be due to a\r\ndirect response of the subcutaneous tissue to the rays of light\r\nreflected from the surrounding objects. The sensitiveness dies away as\r\nthe caterpillar grows older, since little or no change of hue in\r\nresponse to a change of environment could be induced after the\r\npenultimate moult.\r\n\r\n[7] The 'hairs' of an insect are not in the least comparable to the\r\nhairs of mammals, being in truth, modified portions of the cuticle,\r\nsecreted by special cells.\r\n\r\nAmong those families of the Lepidoptera which are usually regarded as\r\nlow in the scale of organisation, caterpillars are very generally\r\nprotected by the habit of feeding in some concealed situation. For\r\nexample, the great larvae of the Goat Moth (Cossus) and the whitish\r\ncaterpillars of the Clearwing Moths (Sesiidae) burrow through the wood\r\nof trees, eating the timber as they go. The little irritable\r\ncaterpillars of the Bell Moths (Tortricidae) roll leaves, fastening the\r\nedges together with silk, and thus make for themselves a shelter; or\r\nthey bore their way into seeds or fruits, like the larva of the Codling\r\nMoth that is the cause of 'worm-eaten' apples, too well-known to\r\norchard-keepers. Very many small caterpillars mine between the two skins\r\nof a leaf, eating out the soft green tissue, and giving rise to a\r\ncharacteristic blister in form of a spreading patch or a narrow sinuous\r\ntrack through the leaf. The caterpillars of the Clothes-moths (Tineidae)\r\nmake for themselves garments out of their own excrement, the particles\r\nfastened together by silk. In such curious cylindrical cases they wander\r\nover the wool or fur, feeding and indirectly supplying themselves with\r\nclothing at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe case-forming habit of the Clothes-moth caterpillars leads us\r\nnaturally to consider the similar habit adopted by their allies the\r\nCaddis-larvae which live in the waters of ponds and streams, for the\r\nCaddis-flies (Trichoptera) have much in common with the more primitive\r\nLepidoptera. The caddis-larva is as a rule of the eruciform type, but\r\nwith well-developed thoracic legs, and with hook-like tail-appendages;\r\nby means of the latter it anchors itself to the extremity of its curious\r\n'house.' It is of interest to note that in the earlier stages of some\r\ncaddises lately described and figured by A.J. Siltala (1907), the legs\r\nare relatively very long, and the larva is quite campodeiform in aspect.\r\nSome of these caddis-grubs retain the campodeiform condition and do not\r\nshelter permanently in cases, as their relations do. Different genera of\r\ncaddises differ in their mode of building. Some fasten together\r\nfragments of water-weeds and plant refuse, others take tiny particles of\r\nstone, of which they make firmly compacted walls, others again lay hold\r\nof water-snail shells, which may even contain live inhabitants, and bind\r\nthese into a limy rampart behind which their bodies are in safe hiding.\r\n\r\nThe silk with which the 'caddis-worms' fasten together the materials for\r\ntheir houses is produced from spinning-glands which like those of the\r\nLepidoptera open into the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the various types of beetle-larvae enumerated above (pp.\r\n50-56) concluded with a short description of the _legless grub_, which\r\nis the young form of a weevil or a bark-beetle. This is a larva in which\r\nthe head alone has its cuticle firm and hard; the rest of the body is\r\ncovered with a pale, flexible cuticle, so that the grub is often\r\ndescribed as 'fleshy.' This type of larva is by no means confined to\r\ncertain families of the beetles, it is frequently met with, in more or\r\nless modified form, in two other important orders of insects, the\r\nHymenoptera and the Diptera. Among the Hymenoptera this is indeed the\r\npredominant larval type. We have just seen that a caterpillar is the\r\nusual form of larva among the saw-flies, but in all other families of\r\nthe Hymenoptera we find the legless grub. A grub of this order may\r\nusually be distinguished from the larva of a weevil or other beetle, by\r\nits relatively smaller head and smoother, less wrinkled cuticle; it\r\nstrikes the observer as a feebler, more helpless creature than a\r\nbeetle-grub. And it is of interest to note that this somewhat degraded\r\ntype of larva is remarkably constant through a great series of\r\nfamilies--gall-flies, ichneumon-flies, wasps, bees (fig. 18), ants--that\r\nvary widely in the details of their structure and in their habits and\r\nmode of life. Almost without exception, however, they make in some way\r\nabundant provision for their young. The feeble, helpless, larva is in\r\nevery case well sheltered and well fed; it has not to make its own way\r\nin the world, as the active armoured larva of a ground-beetle or the\r\ncaterpillar of a butterfly is obliged to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.

After Cheshire, _Bees_.]\r\n\r\nAmong those saw-flies whose larvae feed throughout life in a concealed\r\nsituation, we find an interesting transition between the caterpillar\r\nand the legless grub. For example, the giant saw-flies (so called\r\n'Wood-wasps') have larvae that burrow in timber, and these larvae\r\npossess relatively large heads, somewhat flattened bodies with pointed\r\ntail-end, and very greatly reduced legs. The feeble legless grub,\r\ncharacteristic of the remaining families of the Hymenoptera, is provided\r\nfor in a well-nigh endless variety of ways. The female imago among these\r\ninsects is furnished with an elaborate and beautifully formed\r\novipositor, and the act of egg-laying is usually in itself a provision\r\nfor the offspring. Gall-flies pierce plant-tissues within which their\r\ngrubs find shelter and food, the plant responding to the irritation due\r\nto the presence of the larva by forming a characteristic growth, the\r\n_gall_, pathological but often regular and shapely, in whose hollow\r\nchamber the grub lives and eats. Ichneumon-flies and their allies pierce\r\nthe skin of caterpillars and other insect-larvae, laying their eggs\r\nwithin the victims' bodies, which their grubs proceed to devour\r\ninternally. Some very small members of these families are content to lay\r\ntheir eggs within the eggs of larger insects, thus obtaining rich\r\nfood-supply and effective protection for their tiny larvae. In\r\nPlatygaster and other genera of the family Proctotrypidae, M. Ganin\r\n(1869) showed the occurrence of hypermetamorphosis somewhat like that\r\nalready described as occurring among the Oil-beetles (Meloidae). The\r\nlarva of Platygaster is at first rather like a small Copepod crustacean,\r\nwith prominent spiny tail-processes; after a moult this form changes\r\ninto the legless grub characteristic of the Hymenoptera, among which\r\nlarvae even approaching the campodeiform type are very exceptional. The\r\nspecies of Platygaster pass their larval stages within the larvae of\r\ngall-midges.\r\n\r\nWasps, bees and ants, have the ovipositor of the female modified into a\r\nsting, which is often used for the purpose of providing food for the\r\nhelpless grubs. Thus the digging wasps (Sphegidae and Pompilidae) hunt\r\nfor caterpillars, spiders, and other creatures which they can paralyse\r\nwith their stings, and bury them alongside their eggs to furnish a\r\nfood-supply for the newly-hatched young. The social wasps and many ants\r\nsting and kill flies and other insects, which they break up so as to\r\nfeed their grubs within the nest. It is well known that the labour of\r\ntending the larvae in these insect societies is performed for the most\r\npart not by the mother ('Queen') but by the modified infertile females\r\nor 'workers.' Other ants and the bees feed their grubs (fig. 18), also\r\nsheltered in well-constructed nests, on honey elaborated from nectar\r\nwithin their own digestive canals. In all cases we see that the\r\nhelplessness of the grub is associated with some kind of parental care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Larva of Gall-midge (_Contarinia nasturtii_),\r\nventral view showing anchor process (_a_), and spiracles projecting at\r\nsides. Magnified 30 times. From Carpenter, _Journ. Econ. Biol_, vol.\r\nVI.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Hymenoptera we may pass on to the Diptera or Two-winged Flies,\r\nan order of which the vast number of species and in many cases the\r\nmyriads of individuals force themselves on the observer's notice. F.\r\nBrauer (1863) divided the Diptera into two sub-orders[8]; of the first\r\nof these a Crane-fly or 'Daddy-long-legs' may be taken as typical, of\r\nthe second an ordinary House-fly or Bluebottle. All the larvae of the\r\nDiptera are legless, those of the Crane-fly group have well-developed\r\nhard heads, with biting mandibles, but in the House-fly section the\r\nlarva is of the degraded _vermiculiform_ type known as the _maggot_,\r\nnot only legless, but without a definite head, the front end of the\r\ncreature usually tapering to the mouth, where there are a pair of strong\r\nhooks, used for tearing up the food. A few examples of each of these\r\ntypes must suffice in the present brief survey. A few pages back (p. 66)\r\nreference was made to the production of galls on various plants, through\r\nthe activity of larvae of the hymenopterous family Cynipidae. Many\r\nplant-galls are due, however, to the presence of grubs of tiny dipterous\r\ninsects, the Cecidomyidae or Gall-midges. A cecid grub (fig. 19) has an\r\nelongate body with flexible, wrinkled cuticle, tapering somewhat at the\r\ntwo ends. The head, if rather narrow, is distinct, and beneath the\r\nprothorax is a characteristic sclerite known as the 'anchor process' or\r\n'breast bone.' Along either side of the body is a series of paired\r\nspiracles, each usually situated at the tip of a little tubular\r\noutgrowth of the cuticle; the hindmost spiracles are often larger than\r\nthe others. These little grubs live in family communities, their\r\npresence leading to some deformation of the plant that serves to shelter\r\nthem. A shrivelled fruit or an arrested and swollen shoot, such as may\r\nbe due respectively to the Pear-midge (_Diplosis pyrivora_) or the\r\nOsier-midge (_Rhabdophaga heterobia_), is a frequent result of the\r\nirritation set up by these little grubs. In a larva of the crane-fly\r\nfamily (Tipulidae, fig. 20) living underground and eating plant-roots,\r\nlike the well-known 'leather-jacket' grubs of the large\r\n'Daddy-long-legs' (Tipula) or burrowing into a rotting turnip or swollen\r\nfungus, like the more slender grub of a 'Winter Gnat' (Trichocera), the\r\nstudent notices a somewhat tough cuticle, a relatively small but\r\ndistinct head, and frequently prominent finger-like processes on the\r\ntail-segment. Further examination shows a striking modification in the\r\narrangement of the spiracles. Instead of a paired series on most of the\r\nbody-segments, as in caterpillars and the vast majority of insects\r\nwhether larval or adult, there are two large spiracles surrounded by the\r\nprominent tail-processes, and a pair of very small ones on the\r\nprothorax, the latter possibly closed up and useless. This restriction\r\nof the breathing-holes to a front and hind pair (amphipneustic\r\ncondition) or to a hind pair only (metapneustic type) is highly\r\ncharacteristic of the larvae of Two-winged flies.\r\n\r\n[8] Known as the Orthorrhapha and the Cyclorrhapha; these terms are\r\nderived from the manner in which the larval or pupal cuticle splits, as\r\nwill be explained in the next chapter (p. 88).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.

All magnified.\r\nAfter Howard, _Entom. Bull._ 4, _U.S. Dept. Agric._]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the _maggot_, characteristic of the House-fly section\r\n(fig. 21) of the Diptera, we see the greatest contrast between the larva\r\nand the imago that can be found throughout the whole class of the\r\ninsects. The Bluebottle's eggs, the well-known 'fly blow' laid in summer\r\ntime on exposed meat, not unnaturally arouse feelings of disgust, yet\r\nthey are the prelude to one of the most marvellous of all insect\r\nlife-stories. The fly--with its large globular head, bearing the\r\nextensive compound eyes, the highly modified feelers with their\r\nexquisitely feathered slender sensory tips, and the complex suctorial\r\njaws; with its compact thorax bearing the glassy fore-wings alone used\r\nfor flight, though the hind-wings modified into tiny drumstick-like\r\n'halters' are the organs of a fine equilibrating sense--is perhaps the\r\nmost specialised, structurally the 'highest' of all insects. Yet in a\r\nweek or two this swift, alert, winged creature is developed from the\r\ndegraded maggot, white, legless, headless, that buries itself in putrid\r\nflesh, 'feeding on corruption.'\r\n\r\nThe broad end of the maggot is the tail, while the narrow extremity\r\nmarks the position of the mouth. Above this are a pair of very short\r\nfeelers (fig. 21 _c_), while from the aperture project the tips of the\r\nmouth-hooks (fig. 21 _e_, _f_), formidable, black, claw-like structures,\r\narticulated to the strong pharyngeal sclerites and moved by powerful\r\nmuscles, tearing up the fibres of the flesh. On either side of the\r\nprothorax is an anterior spiracle, a curious branching or fan-like\r\noutgrowth (fig. 21 _b_), with a variable number of tiny openings which\r\nare probably of little use for the admission of air to the tubes. In\r\nmany maggots the mouth-hooks and the front spiracles become more and\r\nmore complex in form in the successive instars. The cuticle, white and\r\nsmooth to the unaided eye, is seen on microscopic study to be set with\r\nrows of tiny spines which assist the maggot's movements through its\r\nfood-mass. At the tail-end the large hind spiracles are conspicuous on a\r\nflattened dorsal area of the ninth abdominal segment; each shows a hard\r\nbrown plate, traversed by three slits. And as we watch this curious\r\ndegraded larva thrusting its narrow head-end into the depths of its\r\nofttimes loathsome food-supply, we understand the advantage of access to\r\nthe air-tube system being mainly confined to the hinder end of the body.\r\n\r\nMaggots, differing from that of the Bluebottle only in minor details,\r\nare the larval forms of a vast multitude of allied species and display\r\ngreat variation in the nature of their food. Most, however, hide their\r\nsoft defenceless bodies in some substance which affords shelter as well\r\nas food. The Bluebottle maggot burrows into flesh, that of the House-fly\r\ninto horse-dung or vegetable refuse. The maggot of the Cabbage-fly eats\r\nits way into the roots of cruciferous plants, that of the Mangel-fly\r\nworks out a broad blister between the two skins of a leaf, into which\r\nthe newly-hatched larva crawls directly from the egg. A large number of\r\nspecies, forming an entire subfamily (the Tachininae) have larvae that\r\nfeed as parasites within the bodies of other insects.\r\n\r\nThe habit of parasitism by maggots in back-boned animals has led to some\r\nremarkable modifications of the larva and to curious adventures in the\r\ncourse of the life-story. The Bot-fly of the Horse (_Gastrophilus equi_)\r\nand the Warble-fly of the Ox (_Hypoderma bovis_, fig. 22) lay eggs\r\nattached to the hairs of grazing animals, which, at least in the case of\r\nGastrophilus, lick the newly-hatched larvae into their mouths. The\r\n'bot,' or maggot of Gastrophilus, comes to rest in the horse's stomach;\r\noften a whole family attach themselves by their mouth-hooks to a small\r\npatch of the mucous coat of that organ. The maggot is relatively short\r\nand stout, with rows of strong spicules surrounding the segments, and\r\nwith spiracles capable of withdrawal through a cup-like inpushing of the\r\ntail-region of the body, so that the parasite is preserved from drowning\r\nwhen the host drinks water. The young maggot of Hypoderma (fig. 22 _e_)\r\nis elongate and slender, spends its first two stages burrowing in the\r\ngullet wall and then wandering through the dorsal tissues of its host;\r\nultimately it arrives beneath the skin of the back and assumes for its\r\nthird and fourth instars a broad barrel-like form (fig. 22 _b_). The\r\nsupply of free oxygen within the ox's tissues being now insufficient,\r\nthe warble-maggot bores a circular hole through the skin and rests with\r\nthe tail spiracles directed upwards towards the outer air. When fully\r\ngrown the maggot works its way through the hole in the host's skin, and\r\nfalling to the ground pupates in some sheltered spot, the life cycle\r\noccupying about a year. Similarly the Horse-bot escapes from the host's\r\nintestine with the excrement, and pupates on the ground.\r\n\r\nA curious modification of the maggot is noticeable in the larva of the\r\nHover-flies (Syrphus). These, unlike most of their allies, live exposed\r\non the foliage of plants, where they feed by preying on aphids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Ox Warble-fly (_Hypoderma bovis_), _a_, female;\r\n_b_, full-grown maggot from back of ox, dorsal view; _c_, egg; _d_,\r\nempty puparium, ventral view; _e_, young maggot from gullet, ventral\r\nview. Magnified (lines show natural size). _a-d_, after Theobald, _2nd\r\nReport Econ. Zool._ (_Brit. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nIn agreement with this manner of life, the cuticle is roughly\r\ngranulated, often greenish or reddish in hue, and the maggot, despite\r\nits want of definite head and sense organs, moves actively and\r\npurposefully about, often rearing up on its broad tail-end with an aphid\r\nvictim impaled on its mouth-hooks.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter reference was made to the exopterygote insects,\r\nstone-flies, dragon-flies, and may-flies, whose preparatory stages live\r\nin the water. Among the endopterygote orders many Neuroptera and\r\nColeoptera, all Trichoptera, a very few Lepidoptera and many Diptera,\r\nhave aquatic larvae. One or two examples of the adaptations of dipteran\r\nlarvae to life in the water may well bring the present chapter to a\r\nclose. Many members of the hover-fly family (Syrphidae) have maggots\r\nwith the tail-spiracles situated at the end of a prominent tubular\r\nprocess. Among the best-known of syrphid flies are the drone-flies\r\n(Eristalis), often seen hovering over flowers, and presenting a curious\r\nlikeness to hairy bees. The larva of Eristalis is one of the most\r\nremarkable in the whole order, the 'Rat-tailed maggot' found in the\r\nstagnant water of ditches and pools. It has a cylindrical body with the\r\nhinder end drawn out into a long telescopic tube, a more slender\r\nterminal section being capable of withdrawal into, or protrusion from, a\r\nthicker basal portion. At the extremity of the slender tube is a crown\r\nof sharp processes, forming a stellate guard to the spiracles. These\r\nprocesses can pierce the surface-film of the water, and place the\r\ntracheal system of the maggot in touch with the pure upper air; while\r\nits mouth may be far down, feeding among the foul refuse of the ditch,\r\nit can still reach out to the medium in which the end of its life-story\r\nmust be wrought out.\r\n\r\nReverting to the first great division of the Diptera, we find varied\r\nadaptations to aquatic life among many grubs that possess a definite\r\nhead. The larva of a Gnat (Culex[9]) has projecting from the hind region\r\nof the abdomen a long tubular outgrowth, at the end of which are the\r\nspiracles, guarded by three pointed flaps forming a valve. When closed\r\nthese pierce the surface-film of the water in which the larva lives;\r\nwhen opened a little cup-like depression is formed in the surface-film,\r\nfrom which the larva hangs. Or having accumulated a supply of air, it\r\ncan disengage itself from the surface-film and dive through the water,\r\nits tracheal system safely closed. Another mode of breathing is found in\r\nthe 'Blood-worms' and allied larvae of the Harlequin-midges\r\n(Chironomidae) whose transformations are described in detail by Miall\r\nand Hammond (1900). These larvae have two pairs of cylindrical,\r\nspine-bearing pro-legs--one on the prothorax and the other on the\r\nhindmost abdominal segment; the latter structures serve to fix the\r\nlarva in the muddy tube which it inhabits at the bottom of its native\r\npond. The penultimate abdominal segment has four long hollow outgrowths,\r\nwhich contain blood, and have the function of gills, while the hindmost\r\nsegment has four shorter outgrowths of the same nature. Enabled thus to\r\nbreathe dissolved air, the Chironomus larva needs not, like the Culex or\r\nthe Eristalis, to find contact with the atmosphere beyond the\r\nsurface-film.\r\n\r\n[9] See _Frontispiece_, A.\r\n\r\nMost remarkable, in many respects, of all aquatic larvae are the grubs\r\nof the Sand-midges (Simulium). These live entirely submerged and, having\r\nno special gills, carry out an exchange of gases through the general\r\nsurface of the cuticle between the dissolved air in the water and the\r\ncavities of the air-tube system. The body is shaped like a flask swollen\r\nslightly at the hinder end and possesses a median pro-leg just behind\r\nthe head, also another at the tail, which serves to attach the larva to\r\na stone or to the leaf of an aquatic plant. The head has, in addition to\r\nfeelers and jaws, a pair of processes with wonderful fringes which by\r\ntheir motion set up currents in the water, and bring food particles\r\nwithin reach of the mouth. A number of the larvae usually live in a\r\ncommunity. Their power of spinning silken threads by which they can work\r\ntheir way back when accidentally dislodged from their resting-place, has\r\nbeen vividly described by Miall (1895).\r\n\r\nExamples might be multiplied, but enough have been given to enforce the\r\nconclusion that the forms of insect-larvae are wondrously varied, and\r\nthat frequently, within the limits of the same order or even family,\r\nmodifications of type may be found which are suited to various modes of\r\nlife adopted by different insects. A survey of the multitudes of insect\r\nlarvae--grubs, caterpillars, maggots--living on land, on plants,\r\nunderground, in the water; feeding on leaves, in stems, on roots, on\r\ncarrion, on refuse; by hunting or by lurking after prey; as parasites or\r\nas scavengers, brings home to us most strongly the conclusion that each\r\nlarva is fitted to some little niche in the vast temple of life, each is\r\nspecially adapted to its part in the great drama of being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPUPAE AND THEIR MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pupal stage is characteristic of the life-story of those insects\r\nwhose larvae have wing-rudiments in the form of inpushed imaginal discs,\r\nand in all these insects there is, as we have seen, considerable\r\ndivergence in form between larva and imago. In the pupa the wings and\r\nother characteristically adult structures are, for the first time,\r\nvisible outwardly; it is the instar which marks the great crisis in\r\ntransformation. The pupa rests, as a rule, in a quiescent condition, and\r\nduring the early period of this stage the needful internal changes, the\r\nbreaking down of many larval tissues, and their replacement by imaginal\r\norgans, go on. Both outwardly and inwardly therefore, the insect\r\nundergoes, at the pupal stage, a reconstruction necessitated by the\r\ndifferences in form and often in habit, between the larva and the winged\r\nadult; and the greater these differences, the more profound must be the\r\nchanges that mark the pupal stage.\r\n\r\nFrom the prominence of imaginal structures in the pupa, it is at once\r\nseen that the pupa of any insect must resemble the adult more nearly\r\nthan it resembles the larva. But in different groups of insects we find\r\ndifferent degrees of likeness between pupa and imago. In a beetle pupa\r\n(see fig. 16 _c_), the appendages--feelers, jaws, legs, wings--stand out\r\nfrom the body as do those of the perfect insect. This type is called a\r\n_free_ pupa. The pupal cuticle has to be shed for the emergence of the\r\nimago, but the pupa is already a somewhat reduced model of the final\r\ninstar, with abbreviated wings and doubled-up legs. A free pupa is\r\ncharacteristic of the Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Trichoptera, Hymenoptera\r\nand many Diptera. In some cases the pupa requires to be specially\r\nadapted for a peculiar mode of life; for example, a special arrangement\r\nof breathing organs may be necessary for life under water, and there\r\nmust needs be temporary pupal structures, not represented in the imago.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the pupae of most Lepidoptera and of some Diptera,\r\nthere is more or less coalescence between the cuticle of the appendages\r\nand the cuticle of the body generally, so that the appendages do not\r\nstand out, but being, as it were, glued down to the body, are somewhat\r\nmasked (see fig. 1 _e_ and fig. 23). Consequently the _obtect_ pupa, as\r\nthis type is called, does not resemble its imago as fully as a free pupa\r\ndoes. The outline of the wings for example in a butterfly's pupa can in\r\nsome cases be traced only with difficulty. T.A. Chapman has shown (1893)\r\nthat the completely obtect pupa characterises the more highly developed\r\nfamilies of Lepidoptera, while in the more primitive families the pupa\r\nis incompletely obtect. If the pupa of a butterfly or moth be lifted and\r\nheld in the hand, a bending or wriggling motion of the abdomen can be\r\nobserved. In the incompletely obtect pupa, this motion is evident in a\r\ngreater number of segments than in the completely obtect, the number\r\nconcerned varying from five to two in different families. In the\r\nnymphalid butterflies, the pupa is often called a 'chrysalis' on\r\naccount of the golden hue displayed by the cuticle, and the term\r\n'chrysalis' is sometimes bestowed indiscriminately on any kind of pupa.\r\nIt has been shown by Poulton (1892) and others, that the colour of a\r\nbutterfly pupa is to some extent affected by the surroundings of the\r\ncaterpillar just before its last moult.\r\n\r\nReference has been made (p. 58) to the power of spinning silk possessed\r\nby many larvae; often the principal use of this silk is to form some\r\nprotection for the pupa, the larva before its last moult constructing a\r\n_cocoon_ within which the pupa may rest safely. Many larvae bury\r\nthemselves in the earth, and the pupa lies in an earthen chamber, the\r\nlining particles of soil fastened together by fine silken threads.\r\nLarvae that feed in wood, like the caterpillar of the Goat-moth (Cossus)\r\nmake a cocoon of splinters spun together, while hairy caterpillars, such\r\nas those of the Tiger-moths, work some of their hairs in with the silk\r\nto make a firm cocoon (fig. 17 _b_). On the other hand, those\r\ncaterpillars known as 'silkworms' make a dense cocoon of pure silk,\r\nconsisting of two layers, the outer of coarse and the inner of fine\r\nthreads. Silken cocoons very similar in appearance are spun by the\r\nlarvae of small Ichneumon-flies. Many pupae lie in a loose cocoon formed\r\nof a few interlacing threads, as for example the conspicuous black and\r\nyellow banded pupa of the Magpie-moth (_Abraxas grossulariata_) and the\r\npupae of various leaf-beetles. Others again spin together the edges of\r\nleaves with connecting silken threads. The grubs of bees and wasps which\r\nare reared in the comb-chambers of their nests seal up the opening of\r\nthe chamber with a lid, partly silk (fig. 18 _co_) and partly excretion,\r\nwhen ready to pass into the pupal state. An additional external\r\n'capping' may be also supplied by the workers.\r\n\r\nThe pupae of butterflies are especially interesting, as illustrating the\r\nextreme reduction of the silken cocoon. The pupa of a 'swallowtail'\r\n(Papilionid) or a 'white' (Pierid) butterfly (fig. 23) may be found\r\nattached to a twig of its food-plant or to a wall, in an upright\r\nposition, its tail fastened to a pad of silk and a slender silken girdle\r\nencircling its thorax. The pupa of a 'Tortoiseshell' or 'Admiral'\r\n(Nymphalid) butterfly hangs head downwards from a twig, supported only\r\nby the tail-pad of silk, which, useless as a shelter, serves only for\r\nattachment. The pupa is fastened to this pad by a spiny hook or process,\r\nthe _cremaster_ (fig. 23 _cr_), on the last abdominal segment. The\r\ncremaster is a characteristic structure in the pupa of a moth or\r\nbutterfly. C.V. Riley (1880) and W. Hatchett-Jackson (1890) have shown\r\nthat it corresponds with a spiny area, the suranal plate, which lies\r\nabove the opening of the caterpillar's intestine. The means by which the\r\nsuspended pupa of a nymphalid butterfly attaches its cremaster to the\r\nsilken pad which the larva has spun in preparation for pupation, is\r\nworthy of brief attention. The caterpillar, hanging head downwards, is\r\nattached to the silken pad by its hindmost pair of pro-legs or claspers\r\nand by the suranal plate, and the cuticle is slowly worked off from\r\nbefore backwards, so as to expose the pupa. Were the process of moulting\r\nto be simply completed while the insect hangs by the claspers, the pupa\r\nwould of course fall to the ground. But there is enough adhesion between\r\nthe pupal and larval cuticles at the hinder end of the body, especially\r\nby means of the everted lining of the hind-gut, for the pupa to be\r\nsupported while it jerks its cremaster out of the larval cuticle and\r\nworks it into the meshes of the silken pad. The moult is thus completed\r\nand the pupa hangs securely all the time. In the numerous cases where\r\nthe pupa is enclosed in a cocoon, the cremaster serves to fix the pupa\r\nto the surrounding silk. Chapman (1893) has drawn attention to the fact\r\nthat among the more highly organised moths the pupa remains in the\r\ncocoon, the emergence being entirely left to the imago, while the pupae\r\nof the more primitive moths work their way partly out of the cocoon\r\nbefore the final moult begins. In the latter case, the cremaster is\r\nanchored by a strand of silk which allows a certain degree of emergence,\r\nand the pupa has rows of spines on its abdominal segments, of which a\r\ngreater number retain the power of mutual motion than in those pupae\r\nwhich do not come out of their cocoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.

Soc._ 1900, and Tutt's _British Butterflies_.]\r\n\r\nWhile the pupa on the whole resembles the imago that is to emerge from\r\nit, there are not a few cases in which a special structure necessary for\r\nsome contingency in pupal life is retained or adopted in this stage. A\r\nbutterfly pupa, like the imago, has no mandibles, but in the case of the\r\nCaddis-flies (Trichoptera) and two families of small moths, the most\r\nprimitive of all Lepidoptera, the pupa, like the larva, has\r\nwell-developed mandibles. These enable the caddis pupa to bite its way\r\nout of the shortened larval case in which it has pupated, and then to\r\nswim upwards through the water ready for the caddis-fly's emergence into\r\nthe air. Pupae that are submerged require special breathing-organs. In\r\nthe previous chapter (p. 77) mention was made of the gnat's aquatic\r\nlarva with its tail-spiracles adapted for procuring atmospheric air\r\nthrough the surface-film. The pupa of the gnat[10] also has 'respiratory\r\ntrumpets' serving the same purpose, but these are a pair of processes on\r\nthe prothorax, so that the pupa, which is fairly active, hangs from the\r\nsurface-film with its abdomen pointing downwards through the water. This\r\nchange of position is correlated with the necessity for the imago to\r\nemerge into the air; were the pupa to hang head downwards as the larva\r\ndoes, the gnat would perforce have to dive into the water. With the\r\nbeautifully adapted transfer of the functional spiracles, their position\r\nis appropriately arranged for the gnat's emergence at the surface, and\r\nthe empty pupal cuticle floats serving the insect as a raft. On this it\r\nrests securely and the crumpled wings have opportunity to expand and\r\nharden before the insect takes to flight.\r\n\r\n[10] See _Frontispiece_, B.\r\n\r\nThe aquatic pupae of other Diptera, many species of the midges\r\nChironomus and Simulium for example, breathe dissolved air by means of\r\ntufts of thread-like gills, which arise on either side of the prothorax.\r\nThe pupae of Simulium rest in their curious little cup-like dwellings,\r\nattached to submerged stones or plants. The Chironomus pupa is usually\r\nfound in an elongate gelatinous case adhering to a stone. From this case\r\nthe pupa rises to the surface of the water, that the midge may emerge\r\ninto the air. Miall and Hammond (1900) describe the arrangement by\r\nwhich, when the pupal stage ends, and these gills are no longer\r\nrequired, their connection with the air-tube system is severed 'without\r\nundue violence.' The walls of the fine air-tubes that pass into the\r\ngills are specially strengthened, but just below the pupal cuticle these\r\nwalls are exceedingly thin and delicate. Thus when the pupal cuticle is\r\ncast, they are readily broken there, and the cuticle of the midge\r\nforming beneath has a spiracular opening into the main air-trunk, ready\r\nfor use during the insect's aerial life.\r\n\r\nAmong those Diptera whose larva is the headless maggot a most\r\nremarkable arrangement for protecting the pupa is to be found. The last\r\nlarval cuticle, instead of being as usual worked off and cast, after\r\nseparation from the underlying structures, becomes hard and firm,\r\nforming a protective case (_puparium_) within which by the processes of\r\nhistolysis and histogenesis already described the organs of the pupa and\r\nimago are built up. This puparium (fig. 22 _d_) is usually dark in\r\ncolour, often brown and barrel-shaped, and a subcircular lid splits off\r\nfrom it at the head-end to allow the emergence of the fly[11]. While the\r\nmaggot breathes by its tail-spiracles, the functional spiracles of the\r\npuparium (connected with the tracheal system of the enclosed pupa) are\r\nfar forward, and these may be situated at the tips of long sometimes\r\nbranching processes, which recall the thoracic gills of the aquatic\r\npupae mentioned a few pages above. Adaptations, various and beautiful,\r\nto special modes of life, are thus seen to characterise pupae as well as\r\nlarvae.\r\n\r\n[11] The presence of this sub-circular lid characterises Brauer's\r\nsuborder Cyclorrhapha. Those Diptera in which the pupal cuticle splits\r\nin the normal, longitudinal manner are included in the Orthorrhapha (see\r\np. 67).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE-STORY AND THE SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of interesting questions are associated with the seasonal cycle\r\nof an insect's life-history. In a previous chapter (IV. pp. 30, 34)\r\nreference has been made to the contrast between the long aquatic life of\r\nthe larval dragon-fly or may-fly, extending over several years, and the\r\nshort aerial existence of the winged adult restricted in the case of the\r\nmay-flies to a few hours. Here we see that the feeding activities of the\r\ninsect are carried on during the larval stage only; the may-fly in its\r\nwinged condition takes no food, pairing and egg-laying form the whole of\r\nits appointed task. A similar though less extreme shortening of the\r\nimaginal life may be noticed in many endopterygote insects. For example,\r\nthe bot- and warble-flies have the jaws so far reduced that they are\r\nunable to feed, and the parasitic life of the maggot (see p. 74)\r\nextending over eight or nine months in the body of the horse or ox,\r\nprepares for a winged existence of probably but a few days. Again in\r\nmany moths the jaws are reduced or vestigial so that no food can be\r\ntaken in the winged state, as for example in the 'Eggars'\r\n(Lasiocampidae) and the 'Tussocks' (Lymantriidae). It is noteworthy\r\nthat in these short-lived insects the male is often provided with\r\nelaborate sense-organs which, we may believe, assist him to find a mate\r\nwith as little delay as possible; the male may-fly has especially\r\ncomplex eyes, while the feelers of the male silk-moth or eggar are\r\ncomb-like or feathery, the branches bearing thousands of sensory hairs.\r\nA box with a captive living female of one of these moths, if taken into\r\na wood haunted by the species becomes rapidly surrounded by a swarm of\r\nwould-be suitors, attracted by the odour emitted from the prisoner's\r\nscent-glands.\r\n\r\nVery exceptionally the imaginal stage may be omitted from the life-story\r\naltogether. Nearly fifty years ago N. Wagner (1865) made the remarkable\r\ndiscovery that in the larvae of certain gall-midges (Cecidomyidae) the\r\novaries might become precociously mature and unfertilised eggs might be\r\ndeveloped into small larvae observable within the body of the\r\nmother-larva; ultimately these abnormally reared young break their way\r\nout. In this case therefore there may be a series of larval generations,\r\nneither pupa nor imago being formed. Extended observations on the\r\nprecocious reproductive processes of these midges have lately been\r\npublished by W. Kahle (1908). A less extreme instance of an abbreviated\r\nlife-story was made known by O. Grimm (1870) who saw pupae of\r\nHarlequin-midges (Chironomus) lay unfertilised eggs, which developed\r\ninto larvae. Here the imaginal stage only is omitted from the\r\nlife-history. Not always however is it the imaginal stage of the\r\nlife-history which is shortened. Reference (p. 18) has already been made\r\nto the case of the virgin female aphids, whose eggs develop within the\r\nmother's body, so that active, formed young are brought forth. Among the\r\nDiptera it is not unusual to find similar cases, the female fly giving\r\nbirth to young maggots instead of laying eggs. Such is the habit of the\r\ngreat flesh-fly (Sarcophaga), of some allied genera (Tachina, etc.)\r\nwhose larvae live as parasites on other insects, and occasionally of the\r\nSheep Bot-fly (Oestrus). In such cases we recognise the beginning of a\r\nshortened larval period, and Brace's investigations in 1895, summarised\r\nby E.E. Austen (1911), have shown that females of the dreaded African\r\nTsetse flies (Glossinia) bring forth nearly mature larvae, which pupate\r\nsoon after birth. In another group of Diptera, the blood-sucking\r\nparasites of the Hippoboscidae and allied families, the whole larval\r\ndevelopment is passed through within the mother's body, and a full-grown\r\nlarva is born the cuticle of which hardens and darkens immediately to\r\nform a puparium; hence these flies are often called, though incorrectly,\r\nPupipara. Still more astonishing is the mode of reproduction in the\r\nallied family of the Termitoxeniidae, curious, degraded, wingless\r\n'guests' of the termites, or 'white ants,' lately made known through the\r\nresearches of E. Wasmann (1901). Here the individual is hermaphrodite--a\r\nmost exceptional condition among insects--and lays a large egg, whence\r\nis usually hatched a fully-developed adult! Here then we find that all\r\nthe early stages, usual in the higher insects, are omitted from the\r\nlife-story.\r\n\r\nInteresting comparison may be made between the total duration of various\r\ninsect life-stories. To some extent at least, the length of an insect's\r\nlife is correlated with its size, its food, the season of the year when\r\nit breeds. Small insects have, as a rule, shorter lives than large ones;\r\nthose whose larvae devour highly nutritive food generally develop more\r\nquickly than those which have to live on dry, poor, substances;\r\nlife-cycles follow one another most rapidly in summer weather when\r\ntemperature is high and food plentiful.\r\n\r\nIn early chapters we have already noticed the long aquatic life of the\r\nlarva and nymph of a dragon-fly, relatively a large insect, and the\r\nrapid multiplication of the repeated summer broods of virgin aphids (p.\r\n18). Within the one order of the Coleoptera it is instructive to compare\r\nthe small jumping leaf-beetles, the 'turnip-flies' of the farmer, whose\r\nlarvae mine in the green tissues, and complete their transformations so\r\nrapidly that several successive broods appear in the spring and early\r\nsummer, with the larger click-beetles whose larvae, the equally\r\nnotorious 'wireworms,' feed on roots for three or four years before they\r\nbecome fully grown. Among the Diptera, the 'leather-jacket' grub of the\r\ncrane-fly, feeding like the wireworm on roots, has a larval life\r\nextending through the greater part of a year, while the maggot of the\r\nbluebottle, feeding on a rich meat diet, becomes mature in a few days.\r\nAs examples of excessively long life-cycles the 'thirteen-year' and\r\n'seventeen-year' cicads of North America, described by C.L. Marlatt\r\n(1895), are noteworthy. Certain specially populous 'broods' of these\r\ninsects are known and localised, so that the appearance of the imagos in\r\nfuture years can be accurately predicted. Here again we have to do with\r\nbulky insects whose subterranean larvae and nymphs feed on comparatively\r\ninnutritious roots.\r\n\r\nIn our own climate, it is of interest to notice the variation among\r\ninsects as to the stage which carries the race over the winter. The\r\nclick-beetles, mentioned just above, emerge from their buried pupae in\r\nsummer, hibernate under stones or clods, and lay eggs among the herbage\r\nnext spring. At the same time of course, owing to the extended term of\r\nthe larval life, many more individuals of the species are wintering\r\nunderground as 'wireworms' of various ages, and these, except in very\r\nsevere frosts, can continue their occupation of feeding on roots. But in\r\nthe case of the 'turnip-flies' the food-supply is cut off in winter, and\r\nall those beetles of the latest summer brood that survive hibernate in\r\nsome sheltered spot, waiting for the return of spring, that they may lay\r\ntheir eggs, and start the life-cycle once again. Among the Diptera, most\r\nspecies pass the winter as pupae, the sheltering puparium being a good\r\nprotection against most adverse conditions, or as flies. But where there\r\nis a prolonged parasitic larval life, as with the bot- and warble-flies,\r\nthe maggot, warm and well-fed within the body of its mammalian host,\r\naffords an appropriate wintering stage.\r\n\r\nAmong the Hymenoptera an especially interesting seasonal life-cycle is\r\nafforded by the alternation of summer and winter generations in many\r\nGall-flies (Cynipidae) as H. Adler (1881, 1896) demonstrated for most of\r\nour common species. The well-known 'oak-apples' are tenanted in summer\r\nby grubs, which after pupation develop into winged males and wingless\r\nfemales. The latter, after pairing, burrow underground and lay their\r\neggs in the roots, the larvae causing the presence there of globular\r\nswellings or root-galls within which they live, pass through their\r\ntransformations and develop into wingless virgin females. These shelter\r\nuntil February or March in their underground chambers, then climb up\r\nthe tree and lay on the shoots eggs, from which will be hatched the\r\ngrubs destined to grow within the oak-apples into the summer sexual\r\nbrood of flies.\r\n\r\nThe Lepidoptera afford examples of hibernation in all stages of the\r\nlife-history. In this order a few large moths with wood-boring\r\ncaterpillars, the 'Goat' (Cossus) for example, undergo a development\r\nextending over several years, while at the other extreme a few small\r\nspecies may have three or more complete cycles within the twelve months.\r\nBut in the vast majority of Lepidoptera we find either one or two\r\ngenerations, definitely seasonal, within the year; the insect is either\r\n'single-brooded' or 'double-brooded.'\r\n\r\nAlmost every winter one or more letters may be read in some newspaper\r\nrecording the writer's surprise at seeing on a sunny day during the cold\r\nseason, one of our common gaily-coloured butterflies of the Vanessa\r\ngroup, a 'Tortoiseshell' or 'Red Admiral,' flitting about. Surprise\r\nmight be greater did the observers realise that the imaginal is the\r\nnormal hibernating stage for these species. Emerging from the pupa in\r\nlate summer or autumn, they shelter during winter in hollow trees, under\r\nthatched eaves, in outbuildings or in similar situations, coming out in\r\nspring to lay their eggs on the leaves of their caterpillars'\r\nfood-plants. The larvae feed and grow through the early summer months,\r\nin the case of the Small Tortoiseshell (_Vanessa urticae_) pupating\r\nbefore midsummer and developing into a July brood of butterflies whose\r\noffspring after a late summer life-cycle, hibernate; while for the\r\nlarger species of the group there is, in our islands, only one complete\r\nlife-cycle in the year, though the same insects in warmer countries may\r\nbe double-brooded. C.G. Barrett records (1893, vol. I. pp. 153-4) how in\r\nthe August of 1879 hundreds and thousands of 'Painted Ladies' (_Pyrameis\r\ncardui_) migrated into the south of England from the European continent\r\nwhere in many places great swarms had been observed early in the summer.\r\n'These August butterflies, the progeny of the June swarms, coming from a\r\nwarmer climate, had no intention of hibernating, but paired and laid\r\neggs. Some of the larvae were collected and reared indoors [butterflies]\r\nemerging in November and December, but out of doors all must have been\r\ndestroyed by damp or frost, in either the larva or pupa state, for no\r\nfreshly emerged specimens were noticed in the spring, and no trace of\r\nthe great migration remained.'\r\n\r\nIn September and October the pedestrian, even in a suburban square, may\r\nsee moths with pretty brown, white-spotted wings flying around trees.\r\nThese are males of the common 'Vapourer' (_Orgyia antiqua_), in search\r\nof the females which, wingless and helpless, rest on the cocoons\r\nsurrounding the pupae whence they have just emerged, the cocoons being\r\nattached to the branches of the trees where the caterpillars have fed.\r\nAfter pairing, the female lays her eggs among the silk of the cocoon,\r\npartly covering them with hairs shed from her body, and then dies. The\r\neggs thus protected remain through the winter, the larvae not being\r\nhatched till springtide, when the young leaves begin to sprout forth.\r\nThe caterpillars, adorned and probably protected by their 'tussocks' of\r\nblack or coloured bristles, feed vigorously. Their activity and habit of\r\noccasional migration from one tree to another, compensates, to some\r\nextent, as Miall (1908) has pointed out, for the females' enforced\r\npassivity; only in the larval state can moths with such wingless females\r\nextend their range. The caterpillars spin their cocoons towards the end\r\nof summer, and then pupate, the moths emerging in the autumn and the\r\neggs, as we have seen, furnishing the winter stage.\r\n\r\nAfter midsummer, the conspicuous cream, black and yellow-spotted\r\n'Magpie' moth (_Abraxas grossulariata_) is common in gardens. The female\r\nlays her eggs on a variety of shrubby plants; gooseberry and currant\r\nbushes are often chosen. From the eggs caterpillars are hatched in\r\nautumn, but these, instead of beginning to feed, seek almost at once for\r\nrolled-up leaves, cracks in walls, crannies of bark, or similar places,\r\nwhich may afford winter shelters. Here they remain until the spring,\r\nwhen they come out to feed on the young foliage and grow rapidly into\r\nthe conspicuous cream, yellow and black 'looper' caterpillars mentioned\r\nin a previous chapter (p. 60). These, when fully-grown, spin among the\r\ntwigs of the food-plant a light cocoon, in which the black and\r\nyellow-banded wasp-like pupa spends its short summer term before the\r\nemergence of the moth.\r\n\r\nAn equally familiar garden insect, the common 'Tiger' moth (_Arctia\r\ncaia_) with its 'woolly bear' caterpillar, affords a life-cycle slightly\r\ndiffering from that of the 'Magpie.' The gaudy winged insects are seen\r\nin July and August, and lay their eggs on a great variety of plants. The\r\nlarvae hatched from these eggs begin to feed at once, and having moulted\r\nonce or twice and attained about half their full size, they rest through\r\nthe winter, the dense hairy covering wherewith they are provided forming\r\nan effective protection against the cold. At the approach of spring they\r\nbegin to feed again, and the fully-grown 'woolly bear' is a common\r\nobject on garden paths in May and June. Before midsummer it has usually\r\nspun its yellow cocoon under some shelter on the ground and changed into\r\na pupa.\r\n\r\nAnother modification with respect to seasonal change is shown by the\r\nTurnip moth (_Agrotis segetum_) and other allied Noctuidae (Owl-moths).\r\nThese are insects with brown-coloured wings, flying after dark in June.\r\nThe dull greyish larvae feed on many kinds of low-growing plants,\r\nusually hiding in the earth by day and wandering along the surface of\r\nthe ground by night, biting off the farmer's ripening corn, or burrowing\r\ninto his turnips or potatoes. On account of the burrowing habits of this\r\ninsect it can feed throughout the winter, except when a hard frost puts\r\na temporary stop to its activity. By April it has become fully grown and\r\npupates in an earthen chamber a few inches below the surface. The Turnip\r\nmoth in our countries is partially double-brooded, a minority of the\r\nautumn caterpillars growing more rapidly than their comrades so that\r\nthey pupate, and a second brood of moths appear in September. These pair\r\nand lay eggs, the resulting caterpillars going as Barrett suggests\r\n(1896, vol. III. p. 291) 'to reinforce the great army of wintering\r\nlarvae.'\r\n\r\nSuch underground caterpillars, to a great extent protected from cold,\r\ncan continue to feed through the winter. With other species we find that\r\nthe larva becomes fully grown in autumn, yet lives through the winter\r\nwithout further change. This is the case with the Codling moth\r\n(_Carpocapsa pomonella_), a well-known orchard pest, which in our\r\ncountries is usually single-brooded. The moth is flying in May and lays\r\nher eggs on the shoots or leaves of apple-trees, more rarely on the\r\nfruitlets, into which however the caterpillar always bores by the upper\r\n(calyx) end. Here it feeds, growing with the growth of the fruit,\r\nfeeding on the tissue around the cores, ultimately eating its way out\r\nthrough a lateral hole, and crawling upwards if its apple-habitation has\r\nfallen, downwards if it still remains on the bough, to shelter under a\r\nloose piece of bark where it spins its cocoon about midsummer and\r\nhibernates still in the larval condition. Not until spring is the pupal\r\nform assumed, and then it quickly passes into the imaginal state. In the\r\nsouth of England, as F.V. Theobald (1909) has lately shown, and also in\r\nsouthwestern Ireland, this species may be double-brooded, the usual\r\ncondition on the European continent and in the United States of America.\r\nThere the midsummer larvae pupate at once and the moths of an August\r\nbrood lay eggs on the hanging or stored fruit; in this case, again,\r\nhowever, the full-grown larva, quickly fed-up within the developed\r\napples, is the wintering stage.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the insects mentioned in this survey, like the last-named\r\ncodling moth, are occasionally double-brooded. As an example of the many\r\nLepidoptera, which in our islands have normally two complete life-cycles\r\nin the year, we may take the very familiar White butterflies (Pieris) of\r\nwhich three species are common everywhere. The appearance of the first\r\nbrood of these butterflies on the wing in late April or May is hailed as\r\na sign of advanced spring-time. They pair and lay their eggs on\r\ncabbages and other plants, and the green hairy caterpillars feed in June\r\nand July, after which the spotted pupae may be found on fences and\r\nwalls, attached by the silken tail-pad and supported by the\r\nwaist-girdle. In August and September butterflies of the second brood\r\nhave emerged from these and are on the wing; their offspring are the\r\nautumn caterpillars which feed in some seasons as late as November,\r\ndoing often serious damage to the late cruciferous crops before they\r\npupate. The pupae may be seen during the winter months, waiting for the\r\nspring sunshine to call out the butterflies whose structures are being\r\nformed beneath the hard cuticle.\r\n\r\nReviewing the small selection of life-stories of various Lepidoptera\r\njust sketched, we notice an interesting and suggestive variety in the\r\nwintering stage. The vanessid butterflies hibernate as imagos; the\r\n'vapourer' winters in the egg, the magpie as a young ungrown larva, the\r\n'tiger' as a half-size larva; the Agrotis caterpillar feeds through the\r\nwinter, growing all the time; the codling caterpillar completes its\r\ngrowth in the autumn, and winters as a full-size resting larva; lastly,\r\nthe 'whites' hibernate in the pupal state. And in every case it is\r\nnoteworthy that the form or habit of the wintering stage is well adapted\r\nfor enduring cold.\r\n\r\nOur native 'whites' afford illustration of another interesting feature\r\noften to be noticed in the life-story of double-brooded Lepidoptera. The\r\nbutterflies of the spring brood differ slightly but constantly from\r\ntheir summer offspring, affording examples of what is called _seasonal\r\ndimorphism_. All three species have whitish wings marked with black\r\nspots, larger and more numerous in the female than in the male. In the\r\nspring butterflies these spots tend towards reduction or replacement by\r\ngrey, while in the summer insects they are more strongly defined, and\r\nthe ground colour of the wings varies towards yellowish. In the\r\n'Green-veined' white (_Pieris napi_) the characteristic greenish-grey\r\nlines of scaling beneath the wings along the nervures, are much broader\r\nand more strongly marked in the spring than in the summer generation,\r\nwhose members are distinguished by systematic entomologists under the\r\nvarietal name _napaeae_. The two forms of this insect were discussed by\r\nA. Weismann in his classical work on the Seasonal Dimorphism of\r\nbutterflies (1876). He tried the effect of artificially induced cold\r\nconditions on the summer pupae of _Pieris napi_, and by keeping a batch\r\nfor three months at the temperature of freezing water, he succeeded in\r\ncompletely changing every individual of the summer generation into the\r\nwinter form. The reverse of this experiment also was attempted by\r\nWeismann. He took a female of _bryoniae_, an alpine and arctic variety\r\nof _Pieris napi_, showing in an intensive degree the characters of the\r\nspring brood. This female laid eggs the caterpillars from which fed and\r\npupated. The pupae although kept through the summer in a hothouse all\r\nproduced typical _bryoniae_, and none of these with one exception\r\nappeared until the next year, for in the alpine and arctic regions this\r\nspecies is only single-brooded. Weismann experimented also with a small\r\nvanessid butterfly, _Araschnia levana_, common on the European\r\ncontinent, though unknown in our islands, which is double (or at times\r\ntreble) brooded, its spring form (_levana_) alternating with a larger\r\nand more brightly coloured summer form (_prorsa_). Here again by\r\nrefrigerating the summer pupae, butterflies were reared most of which\r\napproached the winter pattern, but it was impossible by heating the\r\nwinter pupae to change _levana_ into _prorsa_. Experiments with North\r\nAmerican dimorphic species have given similar results. Weismann argued\r\nfrom these experiments that the winter form of these seasonally\r\ndimorphic species is in all cases the older, and that the butterflies\r\ndeveloping within the summer pupae can be made to revert to the\r\nancestral condition by repeating the low-temperature stimulus which\r\nalways prevailed during the geologically recent Ice Age. On the other\r\nhand, a high temperature stimulus applied to one generation of the\r\nwinter pupae cannot induce the change into the summer pattern, which has\r\nbeen evolved still more recently by slow stages, as the continental\r\nclimate has become more genial. In tropical countries where instead of\r\nan alternation of winter and summer, alternate dry and rainy seasons\r\nprevail, somewhat similar seasonal dimorphism has been observed among\r\nmany butterflies. Not a few forms of Precis, an African and Indian genus\r\nallied to our Vanessa, that had long been considered distinct species\r\nare now known, thanks to the researches of G.A.K. Marshall (1898), to be\r\nalternating seasonal forms of the same insect. The offspring when adult\r\ndoes not closely resemble the parent; its appearance is modified by the\r\nclimatic environment of the pupa. The experiments of Weismann just\r\nsketched in outline show at least that the same principle holds for our\r\nnorthern butterflies.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to see from the life-story of such insects, that the\r\ncourse of the story is not rigidly fixed; the creature in its various\r\nstages is plastic, open to influence from its surroundings, capable of\r\nmarked change in the course of generations. And so the seasonal changes\r\nin the history of the individual from egg to imago point us to changes\r\nin the age-long history of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPAST AND PRESENT; THE MEANING OF THE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter we recognised how the seasonal changes in\r\nvarious species of butterflies as observable in two or three\r\ngenerations, indicate changes in the history of the race as it might be\r\ntraced through innumerable generations. The endless variety in the form\r\nand habits of insect-larvae and their adaptations to various modes of\r\nlife, which have been briefly sketched in this little book, suggest\r\nvaster changes in the class of insects, as a whole, through the long\r\nperiods of geological time. Every student of life, influenced by the\r\nteaching of Charles Darwin (1859) and his successors, now regards all\r\ngroups of animals from the evolutionary standpoint, and believes that\r\ncomparisons of facts of structure and life-history of orders and classes\r\nevidently akin to each other, furnish at least some indications of the\r\ncourse of development in the greater systematic divisions, even as the\r\nfacts of seasonal dimorphism, mentioned in the last chapter, give hints\r\nas to the course of development in those restricted groups that we call\r\nspecies or varieties. A brief discussion of the main outlines of the\r\nlife-story of insects in the wide, evolutionary sense may thus fitly\r\nconclude this book.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we turn to the 'records' of those rocks, in whose\r\nstratified layers[12] are entombed remains, often fragmentary and\r\nobscure, of the insects of past ages of the earth's history. Compared\r\nwith the thousands of extinct types of hard-shelled marine animals, such\r\nas the Mollusca, fossil insects are few, as could only be expected,\r\nseeing that insects are terrestrial and aerial creatures with slight\r\nchance of preservation in sediments formed under water. Yet a number of\r\ninsect remains are now known to naturalists, who are, in this\r\nconnection, more particularly indebted to the researches of S.H. Scudder\r\n(1885), C. Brongniart (1894), and A. Handlirsch (1906).\r\n\r\n[12] See Table of Geological Systems, p. 123.\r\n\r\nWe are now considering insects from the standpoint of their\r\nlife-histories, and the individual life-story of an insect of which we\r\npossess but a few fragments of wings or body, entombed in a rock formed\r\npossibly before the period of the Coal Measures, can only be a matter of\r\ninference. Still it may safely be inferred that when the structure of\r\nthese remains clearly indicates affinity to some existing order or\r\nfamily, the life-history of the extinct creature must have resembled, on\r\nthe whole, that of its nearest living allies. And all the fossil\r\ninsects known can be either referred to existing orders, or shown to\r\nindicate definite relationship to some existing group.\r\n\r\nPassing over some doubtful remains of Silurian age, we find in rocks\r\nusually regarded as Devonian[13] the most ancient fossils that can be\r\ncertainly referred to the insects, while from beds of the succeeding\r\nCarboniferous period, a number of insect remains have been disinterred.\r\nThese Palaeozoic insects were frequently of large size, and they show\r\ndistinct affinities with our recent may-flies, dragon-flies,\r\nstone-flies, and cockroaches. In the Permian period, the latest of the\r\ndivisions of the Palaeozoic, lived Eugereon, an insect with hemipteroid\r\njaws and orthopteroid wings. All these insects must have been\r\nexopterygote in their life-history, if we may trust the indications of\r\naffinity furnished by their structure. In the Mesozoic period, however,\r\ninsects with complete transformations must have been fairly abundant.\r\nRocks of Triassic age have yielded beetles and lacewing-flies, while\r\nfrom among Jurassic fossils specimens have been described as\r\nrepresenting most of our existing orders, including Lepidoptera,\r\nHymenoptera and Diptera. In Cainozoic rocks fossil insects of nearly six\r\nthousand species have been found, which are easily referable to\r\nexisting families and often to existing genera. We may conclude then,\r\nimperfect though our knowledge of extinct insects is, that some of the\r\nmost complex of insect life-stories were being worked out before the\r\ndawn of the Cainozoic era. Some instructive hints as to differences in\r\nthe rate of change among different insect groups may be drawn from the\r\nstudy of parasites. For example, V.L. Kellogg (1913) points out that an\r\nidentical species of the Mallophaga (Bird-lice) infests an Australian\r\nCassowary and two of the South American Rheas; while two species of the\r\nsame genus (Lipeurus) are common to the African Ostrich and a third kind\r\nof South American Rhea. These parasites must have been inherited\r\nunchanged by the various members of these three families of flightless\r\nbirds from their common ancestors, that is from early Cainozoic times at\r\nlatest. On the other hand, the various kinds of such highly specialised\r\nparasites as the warble-flies of the oxen and deer, must have become\r\ndifferentiated during those later stages of the Cainozoic period which\r\nwitnessed the evolution of their respective mammalian hosts.\r\n\r\n[13] The 'Little River' beds of St John, New Brunswick, Canada, by some\r\nmodern geologists however considered as Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing brief outline of our knowledge of the geological\r\nsuccession of insects shows that the exopterygote preceded, in time, the\r\nendopterygote type of life-history. We have already seen that those\r\ninsects undergoing little change in the life-cycle, and with visible,\r\nexternal wing-rudiments, are on the whole less specialised in structure\r\nthan those which pass through a complete transformation. These two\r\nconsiderations, taken together, suggest strongly that in the evolution\r\nof the insect class, the simpler life-history preceded the more complex.\r\nSuch a conclusion seems reasonable and what might have been expected,\r\nbut we are confronted with the difficulty that if the most highly\r\norganised insects pass through the most profound transformations, then\r\ninsects present a remarkable and puzzling exception to the general rules\r\nof development among animals, as has already been pointed out in the\r\nfirst chapter of this volume (p. 7). A few students of insect\r\ntransformation have indeed supposed that the crawling caterpillar or\r\nmaggot must be regarded as a larval stage which recalls the worm-like\r\nnature of the supposed far-off ancestors of insects generally. Even in\r\nPoulton's classical memoir (1891, p. 190), this view finds some support,\r\nand it may be hard to give up the seductive idea that the worm-like\r\ninsect-larva has some phylogenetic meaning. But the weight of evidence,\r\nwhen we take a comprehensive survey of the life-story of insects, must\r\nbe pronounced to be strongly in favour of the view put forward by Brauer\r\n(1869), and since supported by the great majority of naturalists who\r\nhave discussed the subject, that the caterpillar or the maggot is itself\r\na specialised product of the evolutionary process, adapted to its own\r\nparticular mode of larval life.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of insect transformation is, in brief, to be found in an\r\nincreasing amount of divergence between larva and imago. The most\r\nprofound metamorphosis is but a special type of growth, accompanied by\r\nsuccessive castings and renewings of the chitinous cuticle, which\r\nenvelopes all arthropods. In the simplest type of insect life-story,\r\nthere is no marked difference in form between the newly-hatched young\r\nand the adult, and in such cases we find that the young insect lives in\r\nthe same way as the adult, has the same surroundings, eats the same\r\nfood. This is the rule (see Chapters II and III) with the Apterygota,\r\nthe Orthoptera, and most of the Hemiptera. In the last-named order,\r\nhowever, we find in certain families marked divergence between larva and\r\nimago, for example in the cicads, whose larvae live underground, while\r\nin the coccids, whose males are highly specialised and females degraded,\r\nthere succeeds to the larva--very like the young stage in allied\r\nfamilies--a resting instar, which in the case of the male, suggests\r\ncomparison with the pupa of a moth or beetle.\r\n\r\nTurning to the stone-flies, dragon-flies and may-flies, whose\r\nlife-stories have been sketched in Chapter IV, we find that the early\r\nstages are passed in water, whence before the final moult, the insects\r\nemerge to the upper air. Except for the possession of tufted gills,\r\nadapting them to an aquatic life, the stone-fly nymphs differ but\r\nslightly from the adults; the grubs of the dragon-flies and may-flies,\r\nhowever, are markedly different from their parents. In connection with\r\nthese comparisons, it is to be noted that the dragon-flies and may-flies\r\nare more highly specialised insects than stone-flies, divergent\r\nspecialisation of the adult and larva is therefore well illustrated in\r\nthese groups, which nevertheless have, like the Hemiptera and\r\nOrthoptera, visible external wing-rudiments.\r\n\r\nFrom the vast array of insects that show internal wing-growth and a true\r\npupal stage, a few larval types were chosen for description in Chapter\r\nVI, and a review of these suggests again the thought of increasing\r\ndivergence between larva and imago. Reference has been made previously\r\nto the many instances in which the former has become pre-eminently the\r\nfeeding, and the latter the breeding stage in the life-cycle. It seems\r\nimpossible to avoid the conclusion that the active, armoured\r\ncampodeiform grub differing less from its parent than an eruciform larva\r\ndiffers from its parent, is as a larval type more primitive than the\r\ncaterpillar or maggot. A. Lameere has indeed, while admitting the\r\nadaptive character of insect larvae generally, argued (1899) with much\r\ningenuity that the eruciform or vermiform type must have been primitive\r\namong the Endopterygota, believing that the original environment of the\r\nlarvae of the ancestral stock of all these insects must have been the\r\ninterior of plant tissues. He is thus forced to the necessity of\r\nsuggesting that the campodeiform larvae of ground-beetles or lacewings\r\nmust be regarded as due to secondarily acquired adaptations; 'they\r\nresemble Thysanura and the larvae of Heterometabola only as whales\r\nresemble fishes.' There are two considerations which render these\r\ntheories untenable. The Neuroptera and Coleoptera among which\r\ncampodeiform larvae are common, are less specialised than Lepidoptera,\r\nHymenoptera, and Diptera, in which they are unknown. And among the\r\nColeoptera which as we have seen (pp. 50 _f._) display a most\r\ninteresting variety of larval structure, the legless, eruciform larva\r\ncharacterises families in which the imago shows the greatest\r\nspecialisation, while in the same life-story, as in the case of the\r\noil-beetles (pp. 56-7), the newly-hatched grub may be campodeiform,\r\nchanging to the eruciform type as soon as it finds itself within reach\r\nof its host's rich store of food.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of difficulty may be felt with regard to the theory of\r\ndivergent evolution between imago and larva, in the case of those\r\ninsects with complete transformation whose grubs and adults live in much\r\nthe same conditions. By turning over stones the naturalist may find\r\nground-beetles in company with the larvae of their own species. On the\r\nleaves of a willow tree he may observe leaf-beetles (Phyllodecta and\r\nGalerucella) together with their grubs, all greedily eating the foliage;\r\nor lady-bird beetles (Coccinella) and their larvae hunting and devouring\r\nthe 'greenfly.' All of these insects are, however, Coleoptera, and the\r\nadult insects of this order are much more disposed to walk and crawl and\r\nless disposed to fly than other endopterygote insects. Their heavily\r\narmoured bodies and their firm shield-like forewings render them less\r\naerial than other insects; in many genera the power of flight has been\r\naltogether lost. It is not surprising, therefore, that many beetles,\r\neven when adult, should live as their larvae do; since the acquirement\r\nof complete metamorphosis they have become modified towards the larval\r\ncondition, and an extreme case of such modification is afforded by the\r\nwingless grub-like female Glow-worm (Lampyris).\r\n\r\nWith most insects, however, the larva must be regarded as the more\r\nspecially modified, even if degraded, stage. Miall (1895) has pointed\r\nout that the insect grub is not a precociously hatched embryo, like the\r\nlarvae of multitudes of marine animals, but that it exhibits in a\r\nmodified form the essential characters of the adult. Comparison for\r\nexample can be readily made between the parts of the caterpillar and the\r\nbutterfly, whose story was sketched in the first chapter of this book,\r\nwidely different though caterpillar and butterfly may appear at a\r\nsuperficial glance. And the survey of variety in form, food, and habit\r\nof insect larvae given in Chapter VI enforces surely the conclusion that\r\nthe larva is eminently plastic, adaptable, capable of changing so as to\r\nsuit the most diverse surroundings. In a most suggestive recent\r\ndiscussion on the transformation of insects P. Deegener (1909) has\r\nclaimed that the larva must be regarded as the more modified stage,\r\nbecause while all the adult's structures are represented in the larva,\r\neven if only as imaginal buds, there are commonly present in the larva\r\nspecial adaptive organs not found in the imago, for example the pro-legs\r\nof caterpillars or the skin-gills of midge-grubs. The correspondence of\r\nparts in butterfly and caterpillar just referred to, may still be\r\ntraced, though less easily, in bluebottle and maggot. The latter is an\r\nextreme example of degenerative evolution, and its contrast with the\r\nelaborately organised two-winged fly marks the greatest divergence\r\nobservable between the larva and imago. With this divergence the resting\r\npupal stage, during which more or less dissolution and reconstruction of\r\norgans goes on, becomes a necessity, and it has already been pointed out\r\nhow the amount of this reconstruction is greatest where the divergence\r\nbetween the larval and perfect stages is most marked. Whatever\r\ndifferences of opinion may prevail on points of detail, the general\r\nexplanation of insect metamorphosis as the result of divergent evolution\r\nin the two active stages of the life-story must assuredly be accepted.\r\nNo other explanation accords with the increasing degree of divergence to\r\nbe observed as we pass from the lower to the higher insect orders.\r\n\r\nThe successive incidents of the life-story of most insects are largely\r\nconnected with the acquisition of wings. Wings, and the power of flight\r\nwherewith they endow their possessors, are evidently beneficial to the\r\nrace in giving power of extending the range during the breeding period\r\nand thus ensuring a wide distribution of the eggs. In no case are wings\r\nfully developed until the closing stage of the insect's life, they are\r\nalways acquired after hatching or birth. We have already noticed (p. 40)\r\nhow Sharp (1899) has laid stress on the essential difference between the\r\nexopterygote and endopterygote insects, the wing-rudiments of the former\r\ngrowing outwards throughout life while those of the latter remain hidden\r\nuntil the pupal instar. Sharp considers that there is some difficulty in\r\nbridging, in thought, the gap between these two methods of wing-growth,\r\nand has put forward an ingenious suggestion to meet it (1902). Reference\r\nhas already been made to insects of various orders in which one sex is\r\nwingless, the Vapourer Moth (p. 96) for example, or all the individuals\r\nof both sexes are wingless, as the aberrant cockroaches mentioned in\r\nChapter II (p. 15), or certain generations of virgin females are\r\nwingless, for example aphids (pp. 18-19) and gall-flies (pp. 94-5).\r\nInsects may thus become secondarily wingless, that is to say be\r\nmanifestly the offspring of winged parents, and such wingless forms may\r\non the other hand give rise to offspring or descendants with\r\nwell-developed wings. Frequently, as in the case of the aphids, many\r\nwingless generations intervene between two winged generations. A\r\nstriking illustration of this fact is afforded by an aquatic bug, _Velia\r\ncurrens_, commonly to be seen skating over the surface of running water.\r\nThe adults of Velia are nearly always wingless, but now and then the\r\nnaturalist meets with a specimen provided with functional wings, the\r\npossession of which enables the insect to make its way to a fresh\r\nstream. Moreover there are whole orders of parasitic insects, such as\r\nthe lice and fleas, which, showing clear affinity to orders of winged\r\ninsects, are believed to be secondarily wingless. These orders are\r\ndesignated by Sharp 'Anapterygota.' And from the analogy of the periodic\r\nloss and recovery of wings in various generations of the same species,\r\nhe has concluded that the gap between the exopterygote and the\r\nendopterygote method of development may have been bridged by an\r\nanapterygote condition; that the ancestors of those insects with\r\ncomplete transformations were the wingless descendants of primitive\r\ninsects which grew their wings from visible external rudiments, and\r\nthat in later times re-acquiring wings, they developed these organs in a\r\nnew way, from inwardly directed rudiments or imaginal buds.\r\n\r\nThis theory of Sharp's is original, daring, and ingenious, but the loss\r\nand re-acquisition of wings which it presupposes is difficult to imagine\r\nin large groups during a prolonged evolutionary history, while the\r\nsudden appearance of a totally new mode of wing-growth in the offspring\r\nof wingless insects would be an extreme example of discontinuity in\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the most probable suggestion which can be made as to the\r\norigin of 'complete' transformation in insects is that the instar in\r\nwhich wings were first visible externally became later and later in the\r\ncourse of the evolution of the more highly organised groups. In this way\r\na gradual transition from the exopterygote to the endopterygote type of\r\nlife-story is at least conceivable. It will be remembered that a may-fly\r\n(p. 33) undergoes a moult after acquiring functional wings, emerging\r\ninto the air as a 'sub-imago.' In not a few endopterygote insects, the\r\npupa shows more or less activity, swimming through water intermittently\r\n(gnats) or just before the imago has to emerge (caddis-flies); working\r\nits way out of the ground (crane-flies) or coming half-way out of its\r\ncocoon (many moths). The pupa of the higher insects almost certainly\r\ncorresponds with the may-fly's sub-imago, and the facts just recalled as\r\nto remnants of pupal activity suggest that in the ancestors of\r\nendopterygote insects what is now the pupal instar was represented by an\r\nactive nymphal or sub-imaginal stage, possibly indeed by more than one\r\nstage, as Packard and other writers have stated that pupae of bees and\r\nwasps undergo two or three moults before the final exposure of the\r\nimago. Such an early pupal instar has been defined as a 'pro-nymph' or a\r\n'semi-pupa.' Examples have been given of the exceptional passive\r\ncondition of the penultimate instar in Exopterygota. The instars\r\npreceding this presumably had originally outward wing-rudiments in all\r\ninsect life-histories, and the endopterygote condition was attained by\r\nthe postponement of the outward appearance of these to successively\r\nlater stages. The leg and wing rudiments of the male coccid (pp. 20-1)\r\nbeneath the cuticle of the second instar are strictly comparable to\r\nimaginal buds, and these are present in one instar of what is generally\r\nregarded as an exopterygote life-history. The first instar in all\r\ninsects has no visible wing-rudiments, but when they grow outwardly from\r\nthe body, they necessarily become covered with cuticle, so that they\r\nmust be visible after the first moult. There is no supreme difficulty in\r\nsupposing that the important change was for these early rudiments to\r\nbecome sunk into the body, so that the cuticle of the second, and,\r\nlater, of the third and succeeding instars, showed no outward sign of\r\ntheir presence. This suggestion is confirmed by Heymons' (1896, 1907)\r\nobservation of the occasional appearance of outward wing-rudiments on\r\nthe thoracic segments of a mealworm, the larva of the beetle _Tenebrio\r\nmolitor_, and by F. Silvestri's discovery (1905) of a 'pro-nymph' stage\r\nwith short external wing-rudiments between the second larval and the\r\npupal instars of the small ground-beetle _Lebia scapularis_. Whatever\r\nmay be the exact explanation of these abnormalities, they show that in\r\nthe life-story of the higher insects outward wing-rudiments may even yet\r\nappear before the pupal stage, confirming our belief that such\r\nappearance is an ancestral character. The inward growth of these\r\nwing-rudiments may well have been correlated with a difference in form\r\nbetween the newly-hatched insect and its parent. As this difference\r\npersisted until a constantly later stage, and the pre-imaginal instar\r\nbecame necessarily a stage for reconstruction, the present condition of\r\ncomplete metamorphosis in the more highly organised orders was finally\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nTo explain satisfactorily these complex life-stories is however\r\nadmittedly a difficult task. The acquisition of wings is, as we have\r\nseen, a dominating feature in them all, but if we try to go yet a step\r\nfarther back and speculate on the origin of wings in the most primitive\r\nexopterygote insects, the task becomes still more difficult. Many years\r\nago Gegenbaur (1878) was struck by the correspondence of insect wings to\r\nthe tracheal gills of may-fly larvae, which are carried on the abdominal\r\nsegments somewhat as wings are on the thoracic segments. But Börner has\r\nrecently (1909) brought forward evidence that these abdominal gills\r\nreally correspond serially with legs. Moreover Gegenbaur's theory\r\nsuggests that the ancestral insects were aquatic, whereas the presence\r\nof tubes for breathing atmospheric air in well-nigh all members of the\r\nclass, and the fact that aquatic adaptations, respiratory and otherwise,\r\nin insect-larvae are secondary force the student to regard the ancestral\r\ninsects as terrestrial. It is indeed highly probable that insects had a\r\ncommon origin with aquatic Crustacea, but all the evidence points to the\r\nancestors of insects having become breathers of atmospheric air before\r\nthey acquired wings. How the wings arose, what function their precursors\r\nperformed before they became capable of supporting flight, we can hardly\r\neven guess.\r\n\r\nOur study of the life-story of insects, therefore, while it has taught\r\nus something of what is going on around us to-day, and has given us\r\nhints of the course of a few threads of that long life-story which runs\r\nthrough the ages, brings us face to face with the most instructive, if\r\nhumbling fact that 'there are many more things of which we are\r\nignorant.' The passage from creeping to flight, as the caterpillar\r\nbecomes transformed into the butterfly, was a mystery to those who first\r\nobserved it, and many of its aspects remain mysterious still. Perhaps\r\nthe most striking result of the study of insect transformation is the\r\nappreciation of the divergent specialisation of larva and imago, and it\r\nis a suggestive thought that of the two the larva has in many cases\r\ndiverged the more from the typical condition. The caterpillar crawling\r\nover the leaf, or the fly-grub swimming through the water, may thus be\r\nregarded as a creature preparing for a change to the true conditions of\r\nits life. It is a strange irony that the preparation is often far longer\r\nthan the brief hours of achievement. But the light which research has\r\nthrown on the nature of these wonderful life-stories, the demonstration\r\nof the unseen presence and growth within the insect, during its time of\r\npreparation among strange surroundings, of the organs required for\r\nservice in the coming life amid its native air, confirm surely the\r\nintuition of the old-time students, who saw in these changes, so\r\nfamiliar and yet so wonderful, a parable and a prophecy of the higher\r\nnature of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE CLASSIFICATION OF INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nClass INSECTA or HEXAPODA.\r\n\r\nSub-class A, APTERYGOTA.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. _Thysanura_ (Bristle-tails).\r\n      2. _Collembola_ (Spring-tails).\r\n\r\nSub-class B, EXOPTERYGOTA.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. _Dermaptera_ (Earwigs).\r\n      2. _Orthoptera_ (Cockroaches, Grasshoppers, Crickets).\r\n      3. _Plecoptera_ (Stone-flies).\r\n      4. _Isoptera_ (Termites or 'White Ants').\r\n      5. _Corrodentia_\r\n         (_a_) _Copeognatha_ (Book-lice).\r\n         (_b_) _Mallophaga_ (Biting-lice).\r\n      6. _Ephemeroptera_ (May-flies).\r\n      7. _Odonata_ (Dragon-flies).\r\n      8. _Thysanoptera_ (Thrips).\r\n      9. _Hemiptera_\r\n         (_a_) _Heteroptera_ (Bugs, Pond-skaters)\r\n         (_b_) _Homoptera_ (Cicads, 'Greenfly,' Scales).\r\n     10. _Anoplura_ (Lice).\r\n\r\nSub-class C, ENDOPTERYGOTA.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. _Neuroptera_ (Alder-flies, Ant-lions, Lacewings).\r\n      2. _Coleoptera_ (Beetles).\r\n      3. _Mecaptera_ (Scorpion-flies).\r\n      4. _Trichoptera_ (Caddis-flies).\r\n      5. _Lepidoptera_ (Moths and Butterflies).\r\n      6. _Diptera_ (Two-winged flies)\r\n         (_a_) _Orthorrhapha_ (Crane-flies, Midges, Gnats)\r\n         (_b_) _Cyclorrhapha_ (Hover-flies, House-flies, Bot-flies, &c).\r\n      7. _Siphonaptera_ (Fleas).\r\n      8. _Hymenoptera_\r\n         (_a_) _Symphyta_ (Saw-flies)\r\n         (_b_) _Apocrita_ (Gall-flies, Ichneumon-flies, Wasps, Bees, Ants).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF GEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThese names, given by geologists to the various divisions of rocks, as\r\nindicated by the fossils entombed in them, are arranged in 'descending'\r\norder, the more recent formations above, the more ancient below, as\r\nnewer deposits necessarily lie over older beds.\r\n\r\nCALNOZOIC OR TERTIARY GROUP.\r\n\r\nPleistocene.\r\nPliocene.\r\nMiocene.\r\nEocene.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESOZOIC OR SECONDARY GROUP.\r\n\r\nCretaceous.\r\nJurassic.\r\nTriassic.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAEOZOIC OR PRIMARY GROUP.\r\n\r\nPermian.\r\nCarboniferous.\r\nDevonian.\r\nSilurian.\r\nCambrian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list of some books and papers, referred to in this little\r\nvolume or of especial service to the author in its preparation, is\r\nneedless to say very far from exhaustive.
