In this book I have assumed that the many researchers now\r\nactually at work on this problem will achieve such a result in the next\r\ndecade. It is not at all impossible that they may--for we all know that\r\nthe more minds that work at a problem, the sooner it will be solved. The\r\ndiscovery of a means of negating, reversing or otherwise utilizing the\r\nimmense force of gravitation for space flight purposes is now thought to\r\nbe within the bounds of probability. It should occur some time within\r\nthe next hundred years, possibly in even the short period I assume here.\r\n\r\nOnce solved, the severe handicaps imposed on space exploration by the\r\nweight and chemical limitations of rockets would no longer apply. The\r\nwhole timetable of our conquest of the planets in our solar system would\r\nbe tremendously speeded up, from hot Mercury all the way out to frigid\r\nPluto.\r\n\r\nIn describing the visits of the spaceship _Magellan_ to the planets, I\r\nhave endeavored to adhere to known facts and the more reasonable\r\nassumptions about each of these worlds. The planet Pluto, however,\r\ndeserves further comment, occupying as it does both an important role in\r\nthis adventure and a unique one in actual astronomical lore.\r\n\r\nBack at the dawn of this century, many astronomers, and notably Dr.\r\nPercival Lowell, studied certain irregularities in the orbit and motion\r\nof Neptune, at that time believed to be the outermost planet. They\r\ndecided that these eccentricities (or perturbations, as they are called)\r\ncould only be caused by the presence of another, yet undiscovered planet\r\nbeyond Neptune.\r\n\r\nFollowing this line of research, a young astronomer, Dr. Clyde Tombaugh,\r\nworking at Lowell's own observatory, was able to announce on March 13,\r\n1930, that he had finally found this ninth world, which he named Pluto.\r\n\r\nIn the years that have followed, Pluto has proven to be a truly puzzling\r\nplanet. Unlike its neighbors from Jupiter outward, it is not a giant\r\nworld, light and gaseous in nature. Instead, it belongs physically to\r\nthe small, dense inner planets of which Earth is one.\r\n\r\nThe latest viewpoint on this planet, whose size and weight seem quite\r\nlike those of Earth, is that it may not be a true child of the Sun, but\r\nan outsider captured as it roamed the trackless realms of galactic\r\nspace. Its orbit is highly eccentric and rather lopsided, taking it as\r\nfar away from the Sun as four and a half billion miles and as close to\r\nthe Sun as two and three-quarter billion miles, thereby cutting inside\r\nthe orbit of Neptune itself. In fact, during the period from 1969 to\r\n2009 (covering most of the lifetimes of the younger readers of this\r\nbook) Pluto will not be the ninth planet, but the eighth, for it will be\r\nat its closest in those years. Huge Neptune will thus regain temporarily\r\nthe title of being the Sun's farthest outpost!\r\n\r\nThis orbital eccentricity has lead some astronomers to speculate on the\r\npossibility that Pluto may once have been briefly held as a satellite of\r\nNeptune. And following that line of thought, the possibility also has\r\nbeen suggested that Neptune's larger moon, Triton, may once have been a\r\ncompanion of Pluto which failed to break away from Neptune's grip!\r\n\r\nI think that the first men to land on Pluto are going to make some very\r\nastonishing discoveries. But I am also sure that they will never go\r\nthere in rockets. They will have to make the immense trip by some more\r\npowerful means--like the anti-gravitational drive.\r\n\r\nD.A.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Secret of the Ninth Planet_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1. _Special Delivery--by Guided Missile_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning that the theft of the solar system's sunlight began, Burl\r\nDenning woke up in his sleeping bag in the Andes, feeling again the\r\nexhilaration of the keen, rarefied, mountain air. He glanced at the\r\nstill sleeping forms of his father and the other members of the Denning\r\nexpedition, and sat up, enjoying the first rays of the early morning.\r\n\r\nThe llamas were already awake, moving restlessly back and forth on their\r\npadded feet, waiting for their tender to arise and unleash them. The\r\nmules were standing patiently as ever, staring quietly into the distant\r\nmisty panorama of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt was, thought Burl, a dim day, but this he supposed was due to the\r\nearliness of the morning. As the Sun rose, it would rapidly bring the\r\ntemperatures up, and its unshielded rays would force them to cover up as\r\nthey climbed along the high mountain passes.\r\n\r\nThe sky was cloudless as usual. Burl assumed that the dimness was due to\r\nvolcanic dust, or some unseen high cloud far away. And, indeed, as the\r\nexpedition came to life, and the day began in earnest, nobody paid any\r\nattention to the fact that the Sun was not quite so warm as it should\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nThe Denning expedition, questing among the untracked and forgotten\r\nbyways of the lost Inca ruins in the vast, jagged mountains of inland\r\nPeru, was not alone in failing to notice the subtle channeling away of\r\nthe Sun's warmth and brilliance. They were, in this respect, one with\r\nvirtually the entire population of Earth.\r\n\r\nIn New York, in San Francisco, in Philadelphia and Kansas City, people\r\ngoing about their day's chores simply assumed that there must be clouds\r\nsomewhere--the temperature only slightly less than normal for a July\r\nday. A few men shaded their eyes and looked about, noticing that the\r\nheat was not so intense--and thought it a blessing.\r\n\r\nIn some places in Europe, there were clouds and a little rain, and the\r\ndimness was ascribed to this. It was raining in much of Asia, and there\r\nwere scattered afternoon showers throughout Latin America, which were\r\nstandard for the season. There was a flurry of snow in Melbourne and a\r\ncold blow in Santiago de Chile.\r\n\r\nThe men in the weather bureaus noted on their day's charts that\r\ntemperatures were a few degrees lower than had been predicted, but that\r\nwas nothing unusual. Weather was still not entirely predictable, even\r\nwith the advances of meteorology that were to be expected of the latter\r\nyears of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe world was reading about other things than the vagaries of the\r\nweather. In the United States, baseball occupied the headlines, and the\r\nnonathletic-minded could find some speculative interest in the\r\ncompletion of another manned space platform racing along in its eternal\r\norbit twelve thousand miles away from Earth's surface. The U.S. Moon\r\nBase in the center of the Crater Ptolemaeus had described the appearance\r\nof this platform in an interesting radio dispatch which appeared on the\r\nfirst pages of most newspapers. The third prober rocket sent to Venus\r\nhad been unreported for the tenth day after penetrating the clouds that\r\nhid that planet's surface from human eyes. It was, like its two\r\npredecessors, a minimum-sized, unmanned instrument device designed to\r\npenetrate the clouds and radio back data on the nature of the Venusian\r\natmosphere and the surface. But after its first report, nothing more had\r\nbeen heard.\r\n\r\nSome discussion was going on in science circles about what had happened.\r\nSpeculation centered on the possible success of other types of prober\r\nrockets, but it was universally agreed that the time had not come when a\r\nmanned rocket could safely undertake the difficult trip to Venus and\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe years of space flight since the orbiting of Sputnik I back in 1957\r\nhad produced many fascinating results, but they had also brought a\r\nrealization of the many problems that surrounded the use of rockets for\r\nspace flight. It was generally believed that no one should risk a manned\r\nflight until absolutely everything possible that could be learned by\r\nrobot and radio-controlled missiles had been learned. It now looked as\r\nif Venus and Mars trips were still a dozen years away.\r\n\r\nBurl Denning was keenly interested in all of this. As a senior in high\r\nschool, the newly expanding frontiers of the universe represented\r\nsomething special to his generation. It would be men of his own age who\r\nwould eventually man those first full-scale expeditions to neighbor\r\nworlds. By the time he was out of college, with an engineering degree,\r\nhe might himself hope to be among those adventurers of space.\r\n\r\nBurl was torn between two interests. Archaeology was both a profession\r\nand a hobby in the Denning family. His grandfather had been among the\r\nfirst to explore the jungle ruins of Indochina. His father, although a\r\nbusinessman and industrial engineer, made annual vacation pilgrimages to\r\nthe ruins of the old Indian civilizations of the Americas. Burl had been\r\nwith him once before, when they had trekked through the chicle forests\r\nof Guatemala in search of a lost Mayan city. And now they were again on\r\na quest, this time for the long-forgotten treasure of the Incas.\r\n\r\nBurl was thoroughly familiar with the techniques of tracking down the\r\nancient records of mankind. He got along well with natives and\r\nprimitive people; he knew the arts of wilderness survival; he knew the\r\ndelicate techniques of sifting sand and dirt to turn up those priceless\r\nbits of pottery and chipped stone that could supply pages of the\r\nforgotten epics of human history.\r\n\r\nHowever, later in the day it seemed as if their particular camp had\r\npetered out. There were ruins there--a broken-down wall, a dry well and\r\na bit of eroded bas-relief lying on its side. Burl's father looked at\r\nhim thoughtfully. The tall, sandy-haired youth was sitting astraddle a\r\npile of dust, methodically sifting it through a wide-mesh strainer. A\r\nlarge pile of sifted sand gave evidence of the length of his efforts,\r\nand one broken bit of clay was the only result he had obtained.\r\n\r\nTwo of the Indian guides sat patiently in the shade, watching them. One\r\nwas digging slowly, turning up more dirt to be sifted.\r\n\r\n\"I think we've had enough here,\" said the elder Denning. \"Burl, you can\r\nknock off. Tomorrow we'll pull up stakes and see what is in the next\r\nvalley. We'll try to follow that old Inca road over the mountains. I\r\ndon't believe anyone has ever penetrated there--and the airplane surveys\r\nindicated some evidence of human dwellings.\"\r\n\r\nBurl nodded, and set the sifter down. He'd learned to curb his natural\r\nenergies for the exacting tasks required of serious scientific research.\r\n\"Okay,\" he said, \"I was hoping you'd move on soon, Dad. This looked like\r\na washout from the first. I'd say this place was sacked and ruined even\r\nbefore the Incas fell.\"\r\n\r\nThe older man nodded. \"I suppose so. Well, let's wash up and see what's\r\nfor supper.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down to the icy mountain stream to wash the dirt from their\r\nhands. \"It's been a nice day,\" Burl commented. \"In spite of the Sun\r\nbeing out steadily, it wasn't hot at all. Cooler than yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nMark Denning looked up at the sky and the Sun lowering toward the\r\nhorizon. \"There must have been some volcanic dust in the heavens,\" he\r\nsaid. \"The Sun's been a bit dimmed, have you noticed?\"\r\n\r\nBurl squinted his eyes against the glare. \"Wasn't any eruption around\r\nhere. Maybe in Ecuador?\"\r\n\r\nHis father shrugged. \"Could have been thousands of miles away,\" was his\r\nslow reply. \"Volcanic dust travels around the world, just as radioactive\r\ndust permeated the atmosphere from atomic testings. They say that the\r\ndust from the great Krakatoa explosion remained in the atmosphere for\r\nthree years before the last of it settled.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished supper and the Sun was casting its last red rays\r\nover the rapidly purpling landscape, Burl got out the expedition radio,\r\nset up its antenna, plugged in its compact atomic battery, and tried to\r\nget the news from Lima. All he got was static.\r\n\r\nHe fiddled with the dials for a long time, twisting the antenna, ranging\r\nthe wavelengths, but there was static everywhere. \"Strange,\" he said to\r\nhis father, \"something's disturbed reception completely.\"\r\n\r\nPedro Gonzales, their official Peruvian guide, leaned over. \"Could be\r\nthe battery she is broken, eh?\"\r\n\r\nBurl shook his head. \"Not this battery,\" he said. \"It's a brand-new one,\r\na real keen development. And I already checked the wiring. It's some\r\nsort of disturbance that's blocking reception. Maybe we're in a dead\r\nzone or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't dead yesterday,\" said his father. \"Maybe that eruption was\r\nradioactive.\"\r\n\r\nBurl looked up sharply. \"I'll check the Geiger counters, Dad.\r\nSomething's blocking reception, something strong and powerful to\r\ninterfere with this set.\" But when he returned, he had to admit he had\r\nfound nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun went down, they retired, for the temperature drops swiftly\r\nin the high, thin air of the Andes.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of the world people watched their color-vision shows without\r\ninterruption. Reception was good with the Moon base, the space platforms\r\nhad no difficulty making reports, and the radio news beamed out as\r\nusual. In Lima, there was a little static, and direct transmission with\r\nBrazil seemed partially disrupted, but that was all.\r\n\r\nIn the following five days, the Denning expedition had managed the\r\ndifficult climb over the next range of mountains and had come down in\r\nthe high plateau valley between. In this same period, the world began to\r\nrealize that the dimness of the sky was not a temporary phenomenon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWeather stations noted that the past few days had all been several\r\ndegrees under the average. Reports had come in that farmers were\r\nquerying the unusual drop in the temperatures at night. And astronomers,\r\nmeasuring the surface heat of the Sun, came up with strange\r\ndiscrepancies from previous data.\r\n\r\nOne astronomer communicated with another, and a general exchange of\r\nadvice began. In a short while, a communication was laid on the desk of\r\nthe President of the United States, who scanned it and had it\r\nimmediately transmitted to the Secretary General of the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary General circulated the report among the scientific bureaus\r\nof all member nations, and this led in turn to a meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil. This meeting was held in quiet, without benefit of newspaper\r\nreporters or audience.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt. The radiation of the Sun reaching the\r\nface of the Earth had decreased. The facts were indisputable. Where a\r\nday should have registered, in some places, at least 90° in the Sun, a\r\nreading of only 84° was noted. Measurements definitely showed that the\r\nface of the Sun visible to man on Earth had dimmed by just that margin.\r\n\r\nThis might not prove serious at first, but as the scientists called in\r\nby the Security Council pointed out, it promised terrible things as the\r\nyear went on. A difference of five or ten degrees all over the Earth\r\ncould mean the ruin of certain crops, it could mean an increase in\r\nsnowfall and frost that could very rapidly destroy the economies and\r\nhabitability of many places on the Earth's teeming surface.\r\n\r\n\"But what,\" asked the Chairman of the Council, \"is causing this decrease\r\nin solar energy?\"\r\n\r\nThis the astronomers could not answer. But they pointed to one factor.\r\nThe reports from the U.S. Moon Base did not agree with the observations\r\nfrom Earth. Moon instruments claimed no decrease whatsoever in the\r\namount of sunlight reaching the arid, airless surface of the Earth's\r\nonly satellite.\r\n\r\nThe cause was somewhere on Earth. And the Security Council requested the\r\ncareful scanning of the Earth from space platforms and the Moon to\r\ndetermine the center of the trouble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurl Denning had not found the next valley of much interest, either.\r\nEvidence of an Inca road over the mountain had petered out. There were\r\nsigns there had been human dwellings, but they were not Inca--just\r\nreminders of the onetime passage of an unknown band of primitives who\r\nhad grazed their sheep, built temporary tents, and pulled up stakes\r\nperhaps a hundred years before.\r\n\r\nSo again at night, Burl, his father, and Gonzales took counsel. They\r\nwere debating which way to proceed next; Mark Denning reasoning that\r\nthey should go further inland, following tales natives had told;\r\nGonzales urging that they retrack their path and proceed northward\r\ntoward the regions where Inca ruins abounded.\r\n\r\nFor the past week Burl had not been able to get radio reception. The\r\nstatic had increased as they had gone eastward over the mountain, but\r\nnot a word of news or any human voice came through. The Moon was rising\r\non the horizon as Burl sat playing with the antenna. Finally he gave up\r\nand switched it off.\r\n\r\nThe discussion had died away and the three men were quiet. The Indian\r\nguides had retired to their own campfire, and one of them had taken out\r\nhis pipes and was blowing a soft, plaintive tune.\r\n\r\nBurl stared at the full Moon in silence, wondering if he would ever have\r\na chance to walk its surface, or if his own future was to lie in probing\r\nmankind's past rather than surveying the grounds of his future. As he\r\nwatched, he thought he saw a faint light among the brightening stars\r\nwhere none had been before.\r\n\r\nHe squinted, and, sure enough, he saw that one tiny white light was\r\nswinging more and more toward the center of the sky. He pointed it out\r\nto his father and Gonzales. \"Too fast to be a celestial object,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Is it one of the space platforms or a sputnik?\"\r\n\r\nThe two men gazed at it in curiosity. Suddenly it seemed to grow\r\nbrighter and sharper and to twist toward them in its path.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" gasped Burl, but the others were already on their feet.\r\n\r\nThe light plunged down. There was a sudden outburst of yellow flame that\r\ncaused the three to duck instinctively, and brought the Indians to their\r\nfeet with yells. The glare brightened until they could see that\r\nsomething was just above them. The fire vanished as swiftly as it came,\r\nbut a white spot of light remained.\r\n\r\n\"It's a parachute!\" Burl shouted. \"It's a rocket or something, braking\r\nto a stop above us, and coming down by parachute!\"\r\n\r\nIn the pale light of the full Moon they saw that something metallic and\r\nglistening hung from the white mushroom of a parachute. There was a\r\nclanging sound as it hit the rocky earth with a soft, sighing whoosh.\r\nThe cloth of the parachute settled.\r\n\r\nThey ran across the dry stone of the valley floor, but Burl's long,\r\nathletic legs outdistanced the others. He reached it first.\r\n\r\nIt was a cylinder of metal, about three feet long and a foot in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\"It's the nose of a message missile--dropped from a guided missile,\"\r\nBurl announced. \"And--look!\" He dramatically pointed the beam of his\r\nflashlight upon its side.\r\n\r\nThere, written in black, heat-resistant paint, were the words: _To the\r\nDenning Andes Expedition, from U.S. Air Force Base, California Region.\r\nBy Guided Missile Post by Moon Base control, Ptolomaeus Crater.\r\nOfficial. Open Without Delay._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2. _The Valley of Stolen Sunlight_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment all three were silent with amazement. \"From California--and\r\nMoon Base--for _us_?\" gasped Burl, finally. \"But why? What can they want\r\nof us?\"\r\n\r\nHis father frowned. \"Only way to find out is to open it and see.\" He\r\nsquatted down to study the cylinder closer. Burl pointed a finger at the\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like a crack there. Maybe it unscrews. Let's lift it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not as heavy as it had appeared, for, like all rocket missiles,\r\nit was made of the light but tough alloys that were necessary to\r\nconserve weight-lift costs and fuel reserves. They stood it upright and\r\ntried to turn the top. After a little resistance, it unscrewed slowly.\r\nInside, they found a rolled document bearing the seal of the United\r\nStates Air Force.\r\n\r\nBurl took it out, and unfolded it with unsteady hands. His father read\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\nGonzales poked at the empty cylinder, impatiently. Finally, he burst\r\nout, \"What does it say? What do they want?\"\r\n\r\nBurl turned to him. \"It's unbelievable! It's--it's just so darned\r\nsurprising! The dimness of the days, the drop in temperature--it wasn't\r\njust around here! It was all over the world!\"\r\n\r\nQuickly, he went on to tell the Peruvian what they had just learned. The\r\ncommunication was from the U.S. Space Commission and it had been\r\ndirected on its flight from California by the Moon Base, because only\r\nfrom the satellite could the exact location of the Dennings be spotted.\r\nIt seemed that the Dennings were the only scientifically trained\r\npersonnel close to the point on Earth where the disturbance originated.\r\nThis also accounted for the blanketing of radio waves in their vicinity.\r\nSeveral airplanes had tried to locate them, but strange disturbances in\r\nthe ether and atmosphere had made it impossible to establish contact.\r\nAlso, the back reaches of the Andes were poorly mapped and treacherous\r\nin air currents, even in normal times.\r\n\r\n\"During the last week, a certain fraction of the Sun's light and energy\r\nreaching the Earth has been diverted. It has been bent or focused in\r\nmuch the same way that a lens bends light rays--and the point to which\r\nit has been directed is a spot only seven miles from here! Over that\r\nlast mountain range,\" said Burl, pointing.\r\n\r\nGonzales followed his finger. \"Just over the mountains lies the source\r\nof the trouble,\" said Burl excitedly. \"And we're the nearest to it. They\r\nwant us to go over there, see what it is, stop it, or report back. It\r\ntook the telescopes in Moon Base to locate us and to track the center of\r\nthe trouble!\"\r\n\r\nMark Denning pursed his lips. \"We'll have to start tomorrow, and we'll\r\nhave to go fast. A loss of light and heat, however slight, could have\r\nvery serious effects on life if continued too long. We can make it by\r\ntomorrow night, if we start early and leave the Indians and pack animals\r\nbehind.\"\r\n\r\nThe other two nodded. Mark looked at them in the half-light of the Moon.\r\n\"You'll have to stay with the equipment, Pedro, otherwise the Indians\r\nmight abandon it. Burl and I will start out at dawn.\"\r\n\r\nGonzales agreed and the three made their way back to the camp. At the\r\nfirst sign of light breaking in the morning horizon, Burl and his father\r\nstarted off. They carried only enough equipment for survival, plus the\r\nadditional items that might be needed for the emergency ahead.\r\n\r\nThe trek over the mountains was a hard one, the path narrow, steep,\r\nsometimes nonexistent. There were few signs of Indians or animals, and\r\nit was plain that few ever traveled over this range. The air was cold\r\nand thin, vegetation sparse and hardy. All around them was the cold\r\nblue of the sky--a shade darker than usual--and the gaunt peaks of\r\nancient mountains. The Inca kings may have claimed the land here, but\r\neven their hardy legions had never conquered these lonely and hostile\r\nsky domains.\r\n\r\nPanting and weary with hours of climbing, Burl and his father made a\r\nquick lunch in a sheltered jumble of rock near the top. Then,\r\nshouldering their packs again, they trudged on. At last they reached a\r\npoint where the view of the other side spread out before them--a\r\nbreathtakingly clear vision of the little valley below.\r\n\r\nAs they looked down, the air seemed to shimmer and vibrate. Burl rubbed\r\nhis eyes. \"It hurts,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHis father squinted. \"There's a powerful vibrational effect. It may be a\r\nvery dangerous concentration of the invisible rays of the Sun as well as\r\nof light.\"\r\n\r\nOnce Burl had gotten used to the odd visual effect, which was like\r\ngazing into the twisting heat rays rising from an overheated oven, he\r\nsaw that there was a small flat region between the mountains. And in the\r\ncenter of this valley was a large black structure of some sort. The\r\ntwisting effect of the light around it made it impossible to tell more.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said Burl. His father nodded, shifted the pack to ease his\r\nshoulders, unstrapped the hunting rifle slung over his back, and\r\ncarefully checked its loads.\r\n\r\nBurl saw what his father was doing and suddenly understood the danger.\r\nWhat could be doing a thing like this? What but something not of this\r\nEarth? Something of distant space, of a science beyond that of man--and\r\n_unfriendly_ besides. Now, for the first time, Burl realized what he had\r\nnot had time to before--this was an enemy he and his father were\r\nfacing--an enemy of all mankind--and utterly unknown.\r\n\r\nHe gulped, gripped his rifle, and followed his father down the sliding\r\nrocky trail.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer the base of the mountain, the effects of the strange\r\nvibrations grew more pronounced. Burl avoided looking directly ahead,\r\nkeeping his eyes on the ground before his feet, yet even so, he could\r\nnot help noticing how the stones around them seemed to shimmer in the\r\ninvisible waves. From the base of the valley the sky now seemed streaked\r\nwith black and gray rings, as if they were reaching the center of some\r\natmospheric whirlpool. Out of the mountains, after hours of arduous\r\nscrambling, they started across the barren rocky plain.\r\n\r\nBefore them rose a vast circular structure several stories high,\r\nominously black and without any sign of windows or doors. Above the\r\nbuilding protruded two great projections ending in huge, shining discs.\r\nOne of the monstrous cuplike discs was facing the Sun, the other pointed\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nAs the two men came nearer and nearer, the strangeness in the air\r\nincreased. They felt they were being penetrated through and through with\r\ninvisible lances, with tiny prickles of heat. \"Radiation?\" queried Burl\r\nsoftly, afraid of the answer. His father trudged grimly on for a\r\nmoment, and then put down his pack. He took out a Geiger counter and\r\nactivated it.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"No radioactivity,\" he said. \"Whatever this is, it\r\nisn't that.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the wall of the building. Oddly, here they seemed sheltered\r\nfrom the unusual vibrations. Burl realized that the source was above\r\nthem, probably the two mighty discs raised high in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe Dennings surveyed the building, but found no entrance. It must have\r\nbeen a quarter of a mile around its walls, but there was no sign of a\r\ndoor or entry. The wall was of a rocklike substance, but it was not like\r\nany rock or plastic Burl had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to get in,\" said Burl as they returned to the starting point,\r\n\"but how?\"\r\n\r\nHis father smiled. \"This way.\" He opened his pack and took two cans of\r\nblasting powder from it. \"I thought these would come in handy. Lucky we\r\nhad some left over from the blasting we did last week.\"\r\n\r\nHe set both cans at the base of the high wall, wired them together, and\r\nran the wire as far as it reached. When the two men were a safe distance\r\naway, Mark sparked off the explosive.\r\n\r\nThere was a thunderous roar: rocks and dirt showered around them, and\r\nbits of black powdery stuff. When the smoke cleared, Burl and his father\r\nleaped to their feet, rifles in hand.\r\n\r\nThere was a crack in the side of the wall where the explosive had gone\r\noff. And the rip was large enough to get through!\r\n\r\nWithout a word, they charged across the ground, still smoking from the\r\nconcussion, and squeezed through the mysterious walls of the enigmatic\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe walls were thin, thin but hard, as befit masters of atomic\r\nengineering. Inside, they found a roomless building--one single chamber\r\nwithin the frame of the outer walls.\r\n\r\nA dim, bluish light emanated from the curving ceiling. On the uncleared\r\nrocky ground which was the floor of the building were a number of huge\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nThey were spherical glassy inventions, many times the height of a man,\r\nconnected by strings of thick metal bars and rows of smaller globes,\r\nnone of which was familiar. There was a steady humming noise, and above,\r\nthe two giant, metal masts penetrating the ceiling rotated slowly.\r\nDoubtless, the great Sun-trapping discs were affixed to the top of these\r\nmasts.\r\n\r\nThere was no living thing in sight.\r\n\r\nBurl and his father stood silently, half crouched, with rifles at the\r\nready, but nothing moved to challenge them. There was only the humming\r\nof the Sun transmitters.\r\n\r\nBurl called out, but there was no answer. They advanced cautiously,\r\nfearing a trap. The place did not have the look of living things about\r\nit. \"An automatic station,\" said Mark under his breath. \"I think it's\r\nstrictly automatic.\"\r\n\r\nIt gradually became evident that Mark was right. Everything was\r\nautomatic. Whoever had built this structure to divert the rays of the\r\nSun had simply set it down, put it in motion, and left. There was no\r\nevidence of any provisions for a garrison or a director.\r\n\r\nThey studied the machines but could make nothing of them. They found\r\nwhat looked like controls, but although they pushed and pulled the\r\nlevers and knobs, the humming did not cease. It seemed as if the\r\ncontrols were either dummies or had to be specially motivated.\r\n\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Burl, after they had tried pulling all the\r\nlevers on one particular switchboard without any results. \"Do you have\r\nenough powder left to blow up the machinery?\"\r\n\r\nHis father shook his head. \"I had only those two cans with me. We could\r\ntry shooting into the machinery.\" Leveling his rifle, he fired at a\r\nglassy globe perched upon the central sphere. The bullet pinged off it,\r\nand they saw that it had failed even to dent the glistening surface.\r\n\r\n\"It won't work,\" said the elder Denning, after several more shots had\r\nproduced the same result and the concussion reverberating from the\r\nenclosed walls had nearly deafened them.\r\n\r\nThey continued to hunt for a clue, but found none. Dejected, Burl kicked\r\na loose pebble and watched it rattle against a column near the main\r\ncontrol board. A small metallic ball rested on top of the column,\r\napparently unattached. A replacement part, he thought to himself,\r\nwandering over to it. It was about the level of his head.\r\n\r\nWith the thought that if he examined it he might learn something of the\r\nnature of the working machines, he reached out with both hands to pick\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nAs his hands touched the metallic ball, there was a sudden terrible\r\nflash of power. He felt himself grasped by forces beyond his control,\r\nparalyzed momentarily like one who has laid hold of an electrically\r\ncharged wire. He opened his mouth to scream in agony, but he could say\r\nnothing. A great force surged through his body, radiating, charging\r\nevery cell and atom of his being. He felt as if he were being lifted\r\nfrom the floor. Then the globe seemed to dissolve in his hands. It\r\nbecame a glare of light, grew misty, and then vanished.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stood there on tiptoe, arced with the potent violence of\r\nthe force, glowing from within with energies, and then he felt as if the\r\nsupercharge were dissolving itself, slipping into him, sliding into the\r\nground, then disappearing.\r\n\r\nHe stood before the column, swaying, but still conscious and alive. His\r\nhands were still raised, but there was no ball between them, neither of\r\nmetal nor of power.\r\n\r\nHe let them fall to his side and took a step. He was whole, he was\r\nsound, he was unharmed. He heard his father's footsteps running to him,\r\nand murmured weakly, \"I'm all right.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was. He could see no sign of damage. \"I must have absorbed an\r\nawful lot of that energy--or whatever it was,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAfter resting a moment, he decided to try the useless controls again.\r\nGoing over to one small board, he idly shoved a lever. This time he felt\r\nresistance. The lever was activated. There was a slight change in the\r\nradiance of one globe.\r\n\r\n\"Dad!\" Burl shouted. \"It works! It works for me now!\"\r\n\r\nMark Denning watched as Burl turned dials and levers and got responses.\r\n\"You must have been charged in a special way,\" he said excitedly.\r\n\"That's how they lock their devices. They will only respond to a person\r\ncarrying that special energy charge, whatever it was. Come on, let's get\r\nto the main control, before the effect goes away--if it does.\"\r\n\r\nThe two dashed to the panel which, they guessed, activated the main Sun\r\ntransmitter. Burl grabbed the instruments and threw them back to what\r\nseemed to be the zero positions.\r\n\r\nThe humming rose in intensity, then quieted down and finally stopped.\r\nThere was a series of clicks, and one by one, the various globes,\r\ncondensers and glowing machines died out. Above them came a whirring\r\nnoise, and Burl looked up to see the masts withdrawing into the\r\nbuilding, their discs presumably left flat and directionless.\r\n\r\nIt felt different. Suddenly they knew that the vibrations which had been\r\nso heavy in the air about them were gone. There was silence everywhere,\r\nthe natural silence of an empty, lifeless building in an uninhabited\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nBurl and his father made their way to the break in the wall and climbed\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nOutside, the Sun shone down brighter than it had before. The sky was\r\nthe calm serene blue of a cloudless day. Burl knew that at that same\r\nmoment, all over the world, the sky was clearer and the Sun warmer.\r\n\r\nBut for how long? Behind them the building still stood--and its\r\ninventors were still to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3. _The Secret of A-G 17_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dennings did not have much time to speculate on the mystery of the\r\nSun-stealers. For just as they were discussing what should be their next\r\ncourse of action, the problem was solved for them. There was a roaring\r\nin the air, then a humming, and in a matter of a few more seconds, six\r\nrocket helicopters popped into sight, hovered over the valley on\r\nstreaming jets, and settled down.\r\n\r\n\"They're U.S. planes!\" gasped Burl, jumping to his feet and going to\r\nmeet them. \"It must mean that they know we stopped the machines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Obviously,\" said his father, striding with him to greet the helmeted\r\nman who was now stepping out of the lead machine. By this time the last\r\nof the squad had landed, and the khaki-clad soldiers in them were\r\nalready disembarking. \"I imagine that all over the world the sky turned\r\na little brighter. It must have been apparent at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader of the 'copter men reached them. He was a tall, bronzed man,\r\nwearing the service coveralls and markings of a captain of the Air\r\nForce. He stretched out his hand. \"You must be the Dennings. I'm Captain\r\nSaunders. I've been asked to bring you back with me right away so that\r\nwe can get a complete report on this affair. How fast can you get\r\nready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Burl, \"we're ready right now. As soon as we can dump our\r\npacks aboard. But, gee, you mean go back--where?\"\r\n\r\nSaunders smiled grimly. \"To California. We just left there. I have been\r\ngiven urgent orders to waste no time. So will you oblige?\"\r\n\r\nThe two Dennings looked at each other. This was important, all right.\r\nThey realized that these planes had flown on fast rockets the instant\r\nthe sky had cleared. Possibly there was still a crisis--one they had not\r\nheard of.\r\n\r\nThey did not pause to ask further questions. Mark Denning asked the\r\ncaptain to dispatch one of his 'copters to the camp beyond the mountains\r\nto tell Gonzales to load up and start back for Lima. This order given,\r\nthe two Dennings climbed into the rocket 'copter, and Saunders took the\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nWith a whoosh, the squat craft lifted on its rockets, its jet-driven fan\r\ncarried it up, folded, and the rocket engine took over. On upward into\r\nthe stratosphere they hurtled, across the Western Hemisphere, across\r\nthe face of jungle and isthmus, across the barren mountains of Mexico,\r\nand in a matter of less than half an hour, settled down in the wide\r\ngreen field of a U.S. Air Force base in southern California. It was all\r\nso swift, so sudden, that to Burl it seemed like a dream. There had been\r\nso many days in the field, in the peace and quiet of the high mountains\r\nof the Andes. There had been the slow hunting around age-worn ruins; the\r\ncareful, deliberate sifting of tons of soil and sand for tiny shards;\r\nthen this: the urgent message, the trek, the weird building, the\r\nstrange, body-filling shock, and the control over the Sun-theft globes,\r\nfollowed by the swift transition over thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nHere he was in his home country--weeks sooner than he had expected--but\r\nnot to return to his home and school. No, for he felt that somehow an\r\nadventure was beginning that could lead anywhere. Perhaps his adventure\r\nhad actually ended, but he saw now that he would be questioned, probed,\r\nand asked to recount his story over and over.\r\n\r\nBurl and his father were met at the port by a group of officers and\r\nescorted rapidly to a room in a large building. Here there were half a\r\ndozen men in civilian clothes. One by one, these men were introduced,\r\nand as each one was named, Burl wondered more about what was to come.\r\n\r\nThere was a general from Army Intelligence. There was a high member of\r\nthe State Department. There were three noted astronomers--among them the\r\nsurprisingly young Russell Clyde and the elderly and famous Dr.\r\nMerckmann. There was an aircraft manufacturer whose name graced a\r\nthousand planes, and an engineer who had contributed to the conquest of\r\nthe Moon.\r\n\r\nThe general, Walton Shrove, asked them to sit down. He was in charge of\r\nthe affair. It turned out to be a careful questioning of their story. It\r\nwas not a hounding of questions as in a police quizzing, or a baiting\r\nfrom newspapermen eager to get a scoop. Rather, their questions were\r\ndeliberate and intelligent. They drew out the full account of what Burl\r\nand his father had seen in that valley, and of what the Sun-theft globes\r\nappeared to be like in operation. They concentrated deeply on the\r\ncurious experience which had placed in Burl the charge that enabled him\r\nto control the machines.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind,\" the general asked Burl, \"if we subject you to a series\r\nof medical and electronic tests to determine whether this charge is\r\nstill with you?\"\r\n\r\nBurl shook his head. \"I'll go along with anything you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" the general smiled. \"We'll make our purposes clear to you\r\nafterward. But we want to get this over as soon as we can.\"\r\n\r\nBurl left the room in company with three technicians who had come in.\r\nThey took him to the medical office at the base and there he was given a\r\ncomplete check. At the electronics lab, electrodes were attached to him\r\nand careful readings were made of the natural electrical resistance of\r\nhis body, and of his apparent physical charge. After an hour of tests,\r\nBurl was brought back to the main council room.\r\n\r\nAs he entered, he sensed he had interrupted something important. His\r\nfather looked at him, and Burl detected in his face a certain curious\r\nmingling of pride and parental concern. What, the young man wondered,\r\nwere they all up to?\r\n\r\nWhen he was seated, the company grew silent. The general pursed his\r\nlips, looked directly at Burl, and said, \"I think the time has come to\r\nacquaint you with the problem our world is facing. We may ask you to\r\nmake a very personal decision, and we think you ought to know what may\r\nhang on it.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Every face at the table was grim. Mark Denning, too, was\r\nsober, though Burl detected that he also did not quite know what was to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\"It is apparent that some race of beings, some species from outer space,\r\nunknown to us, has begun a process of tapping the power and light of the\r\nSun for transmission elsewhere. The station on Earth, which you shut\r\ndown, was an important one. But ... it was not the only one. There are\r\nothers, operating in this solar system.\" He nodded to Merckmann.\r\n\r\nThe old astronomer took the cue. \"The observatories of the Earth, aided\r\nby the lunar observers, have definitely determined that there is still a\r\ncertain amount of light being shifted from the faces of other planets\r\nand diverted. We have detected by telescopic and telethermic\r\nmeasurements that there are areas of Sun-disturbances on the surfaces of\r\nthe planets Mercury and Mars. We suspect the existence of one on Venus.\r\nWe believe that this may prove to be true on other planets as well, but\r\nwe have no doubt of the first two.\r\n\r\n\"Measurements of the amount of Sun power being piped away, and of the\r\neffect of the magnetic disturbances used to create and maintain these\r\nstations, have shown that they will have a definite effect on the\r\nstructure of the Sun itself. We have not yet completed all our\r\ncalculations, but preliminary studies indicate that if this type of\r\nsolar interference is not stopped, it may cause our Sun to nova in\r\nsomewhere between two and three years time.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, but the thirty-year-old prodigy, Russell Clyde, took up the\r\nstory. \"By nova, we mean that the Sun will literally explode. It will\r\nflame up, burst to many times its present size. Such an explosion will\r\nburn Earth to cinders, render all the planets inside the orbit of\r\nJupiter uninhabitable, scorch their atmospheres, dissolve their waters\r\ninto steam, and make them lifeless flaming deserts. We have seen other\r\nstars turn nova. We have measured their explosions. We know just about\r\nwhat age and stability inside a sun is necessary to cause this. And we\r\nfear that the danger of our own Sun doing so is great--if the\r\nSun-tapping is not stopped.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone at the table was silent. Burl was stunned. Finally he caught\r\nhis breath. \"But how can we stop it? We can't get to all the planets in\r\ntime. Our rockets are not ready--and rocketships would be too slow. Why\r\nit would take two years for rocketships to reach Mars, if the expedition\r\nwere ready now ... and I understand that it will be another ten years\r\nbefore Operation Mars is even attempted.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Shrove nodded. \"That is correct. Our rocket engineering is not\r\nyet advanced enough to allow us to take such emergency action. We are\r\nstill only just over the doorstep of interplanetary flight--and our\r\nenemies, whoever they may be, are obviously far advanced. But, as you\r\nwill see, we are not entirely without hope. Colonel Lockhart, will you\r\ntell them about Project A-G?\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned to Lockhart, who was a short, stocky man in civilian\r\nclothes. Burl realized that this man had been a colonel at one time, but\r\nremembered now that he had taken a post with one of the largest aviation\r\ncompanies after leaving the service. Lockhart turned cold gray eyes\r\ndirectly to Burl.\r\n\r\n\"We have in my company's experimental grounds one virtually untested\r\nvessel which may be able to make a flight to Mars, or any other planet,\r\nin the time allowed. This is the craft we refer to as A-G 17, the\r\nseventeenth such experiment, and the first to succeed. It is powered by\r\nan entirely new method of flight, the force of anti-gravity.\"\r\n\r\nBurl hung breathlessly on his next words. \"You probably know that work\r\non the scientific negation of gravity has been going on since the early\r\n1950's. It was known shortly after experiments had been conducted on\r\natomic and subatomic particles that grounds had at last been found by\r\nmeans of which a counteraction to gravity might be set up. Early\r\nsubatomic studies showed that such a force was not only theoretically\r\npossible, but that certain subparticles actually displayed such\r\ntendencies. On the basis of these first discoveries, work has been going\r\non in the development of negative gravitational drive for at least\r\ntwenty years. As early as 1956, there were not less than fourteen such\r\nprojects under way in virtually all the leading aircraft industries of\r\nthe United States, not to mention the rest of the world. In the last few\r\nyears, at the direction of the Air Force, these projects have been\r\nconsolidated, placed under one main roof, and brought to its present\r\nstatus, which is, we believe, the one of final triumph.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at General Shrove, who returned the glance unsmilingly.\r\n\"After the successful testing of several models, a full-sized craft has\r\nbeen built which utilizes the new method of space drive. One such craft\r\nhas been built, and only one. This ship, if it works, is at this time\r\nthe only means by which humanity can hope to make the trips to the other\r\nplaces in the solar system from which the Sun-stealers are working. It\r\nis with this one vessel only that we can put their Sun-tap stations out\r\nof commission.\r\n\r\n\"But I emphasize again the experimental nature of this ship. What its\r\ncapacities are and how well it will work is still a matter of\r\nplanning-book conjecture. We can prepare the ship to take off in one\r\nweek's time. I do not think, judging from what Merckmann and Clyde have\r\nsaid, that we can afford to wait any longer. Another such ship cannot be\r\nbuilt in less than a year.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Shrove spoke then. \"It is already arranged that this A-G 17\r\nspaceship is going to go. A volunteer crew has been selected; several of\r\nthem are in this room.\" He nodded briefly to Clyde and to Lockhart. \"But\r\nalthough these volunteers are among the best men in their fields, there\r\nisn't one of them who couldn't be replaced by someone equally skilled in\r\nthe same field. But there is one person on Earth right now who may just\r\npossibly be unique. This person may hold, by virtue of an experience not\r\nshared by any other human being, a special key that will render easier\r\nthe task that this spaceship must fulfill.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Burl, who sat tingling with suspense. \"You, Burl Denning,\r\nare apparently still carrying some sort of electronic or subelectronic\r\ncharge which is attuned to the controls of the Sun-tap station. We feel\r\nthat you should be along on this expedition. It will be long and\r\ndangerous, it will involve landings on worlds no man has ever visited or\r\nexpected to visit for hundreds of years. There is an enemy in the sky\r\nwho will certainly try to stop our single ship. To be bluntly honest,\r\nthe voyagers on this ship face such dangers as explorers have not faced\r\nsince the days of Magellan and Cook. Its chances of return are probably\r\nremote. But with the permission of your father, which he has already\r\ngiven, I would like to ask that you volunteer to join its crew.\"\r\n\r\nBurl felt dizzy, his heart thumping painfully within his chest. He took\r\na deep breath, and then carefully, trying to keep his voice from\r\nquivering, he said, \"Yes, I'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4. _The Hidden Skyport_\r\n\r\n\r\nAround the table there was a concerted sigh. Burl, his ears still\r\nthrobbing from his sudden excitement, realized each of them had been\r\nholding his breath. General Shrove smiled and glanced at the elder\r\nDenning, who sat expressionless. It is not an easy thing for him, Burl\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Burl knew that he had come of age. This moment of\r\ndecision, coming truly and literally like a bolt out of the blue, had\r\nthrust him into man's estate before his time. He would show that he was\r\nable to carry this burden.\r\n\r\nShrove now spoke to Lockhart. \"Colonel, we are holding you to your\r\nschedule. According to it, you can take off in five more days. Will you\r\nneed any more time because of this addition to your crew?\"\r\n\r\nThe stocky air veteran shook his head. \"Not at all. We'll be loaded and\r\nready on the hour I set. I'll take Denning in hand and brief him on what\r\nhe may need to know. Actually, we may even be able to get him a\r\nhome-leave. After all, his duties won't begin until actual planetfalls\r\nare made.\"\r\n\r\nThey rose from their seats. Burl stood up, uncertain as to procedure,\r\nbut Lockhart came over to him and took his arm. \"Burl, we're going to\r\nhave to give you a rundown on the ship and the plans. We've no time to\r\nwaste if you want to get a chance to say good-by to your folks later\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Burl. He turned and waved to his father, who was in\r\nconversation with the general. \"I'll see you at home in a few days,\r\nDad,\" he called, then followed Lockhart out.\r\n\r\nOutside the building they were joined by several other members of the\r\nconference and immediately ringed about by a squad of Air Force men\r\nwearing sidearms. Burl realized that they were to be thus guarded\r\neverywhere they went. Obviously, the possibility that the builders of\r\nthe Sun-traps might have agents operating on Earth had occurred to the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nRussell Clyde, the young astronomer, was among their group. He walked\r\nover to Burl and shoved out a hand. \"Glad to have you with us, Burl.\r\nThis is going to be quite a trip!\"\r\n\r\nClyde was about Burl's size. He had an engagingly boyish air about him,\r\nand Burl took a liking to him. Burl had heard of him before. For the\r\nyoung man, while still a college student, had formulated a remarkable\r\nnew theory of the composition of galactic formations which had instantly\r\nfocused the attention of the scientific world upon him. This theory had\r\nbeen taken up by the gray-beards of the scientific world and had\r\nsurvived the test of their debates. Now associated with the great Mount\r\nPalomar Observatory, Russell Clyde had continued to build a reputation\r\nin astronomical circles.\r\n\r\n\"You're one of the expedition, then?\" asked Burl, shaking his hand.\r\n\r\nThe redhead nodded. \"Yep. They're taking me as their chief astrogator.\r\nAnd don't think it's because I'm any great shakes at it, either! It's\r\njust that I'm still young enough to take the kind of shoving around\r\nthese high brass figure we're going to get. Boy, have they got it\r\nfigured!\"\r\n\r\nBurl chuckled. \"Ah, you're kidding, Dr. Clyde. You've probably been in\r\non this from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head vigorously. \"Nope. It was going to be\r\nMerckmann's baby, but when they realize they have a fight on their\r\nhands, they always look for young blood. And, say, cut out this 'Doctor'\r\nstuff. Call me Russ. We're going to share quarters, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\" asked a tall, rather sharp-featured man who had\r\noverheard them. \"The colonel will assign quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say he will ... and you can bet on that,\" snapped Russell Clyde. He\r\nwaved a hand in introduction. \"This is Harvey Caton, one of our\r\nelectronics wizards.\"\r\n\r\nCaton nodded, but before he could continue the discussion, Lockhart\r\nrounded them all up, packed them into a couple of station wagons, guards\r\nand all, and they were off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next days were hectic ones. By car and plane the group was\r\ntransferred to the large, closely guarded base in Wyoming where the\r\nsecret anti-gravity ship was waiting. Burl did not see this ship right\r\naway. First, he was introduced to all the other members of the crew, and\r\ngiven a mass of papers to study which outlined the basic means of the\r\nnew space drive, and which detailed the opinions and suggestions of\r\nvarious experts as to methods of procedure and courses of action. He was\r\nsubjected to various space medical tests to determine his reactions\r\nunder differing pressures and gravities. Although it proved a strenuous\r\nand exhausting routine, he emerged from the tests with flying colors.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was commanded, as he had known, by Colonel Lockhart who\r\nwould also act as chief pilot. The famous military flier proved to be a\r\nforceful personality with a great skill at handling people. He knew how\r\nto get the most out of each man.\r\n\r\nRussell Clyde was the chief astrogator and astronomical expert.\r\nAssisting him was the rather pedantic and sober Samuel Oberfield, a\r\nmathematical wizard and astrophysicist, on leave from an assistant\r\nprofessorship at one of the great universities. Clyde and Oberfield\r\nwould also act as copilots relieving Lockhart.\r\n\r\nHarvey Caton, blond Jurgen Detmar, and the jovial Frank Shea were the\r\nthree-man engineering crew. Completing the members of the expedition was\r\nanother trio chosen to act as general crew, medical and commissary men\r\nwhile in flight, and as a trained explorer-fighter unit while on\r\nplanetside. Roy Haines, of whose exploits in Africa and the jungles of\r\nSouth America Burl Denning had heard, was the first of these, a rugged,\r\nweather-beaten, but astonishingly alert explorer. Captain Edgar Boulton,\r\non leave from the United States Marines, was the second--a man who had\r\nmade an impressive record in various combat actions in his country's\r\nservice. The Antarctic explorer, Leon Ferrati, completed the listing.\r\nFerrati was an expert on getting along in conditions of extreme\r\nfrigidity and hostile climates. Of these men, only Lockhart, Clyde,\r\nDetmar and Ferrati had had space experience in the platforms and in\r\nMoon-rocketry.\r\n\r\nIt was still, thought Burl, a large crew for a spaceship. No rocket\r\nbuilt to date had ever been able to carry such a load. But by then he\r\nhad realized that the strict weight limitation imposed by rocket fuels\r\nno longer applied to this new method of space flight. Burl found himself\r\nmore and more anxious to see this wonderful craft.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the morning of the second day that Burl's chance came.\r\nHe had fallen asleep on the stiff army cot in the hastily improvised\r\nbase on the Wyoming prairie where the final work was being done. The\r\nday had been a confused jumble of impressions, with little time to catch\r\nhis breath. Now he had slept the sleep of exhaustion, only to be\r\nawakened at dawn by Lockhart.\r\n\r\n\"Up and dress,\" the colonel greeted him. \"We're taking you out to look\r\nthe ship over. Detmar will come along and explain the drive.\"\r\n\r\nBurl threw his clothes on, gulped down breakfast in the company of the\r\nothers at the messhall, and soon was speeding along a wide, new road\r\nthat ran up to the mountains edging the wide western plain. As they\r\nneared the mountains, he saw a high wooden wall blocking the road and\r\nview; this was the barrier that concealed the ship nestled in the valley\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nThey passed the guards' scrutiny and emerged into the valley. The A-G 17\r\nloomed suddenly above them, and Burl's first impression was of a\r\nglistening metal fountain roaring up from the ground, gathering itself\r\nhigh in the sky, as if to plunge down again in a rain of shining steel.\r\n\r\nThe ship was like a huge, gleaming raindrop. It stood two hundred feet\r\nhigh, the wide, rounded, blunt bulk of it high in the air, as if about\r\nto fall upward instead of downward. It tapered down to a thin, perfectly\r\nstreamlined point which touched the ground. It was held upright by a\r\ngreat cradle of girders and beams. At various points the polished steel\r\nwas broken by indentations or inset round dots that were thick portholes\r\nor indications of entry ports. Around its equator, girding the widest\r\nsection was a ring of portholes, and there were scattered rings of\r\nsimilar portholes below this.\r\n\r\nAs the three men drew near the tail, the great bulk loomed overhead, and\r\nBurl felt as if its weight were bearing down on him as they walked\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nTwo men were suspended from the scaffolding above. Burl twisted his neck\r\nand saw that the designation A-G 17 and the white-star insignia of the\r\nUnited States had been lettered along the sides. But what was it the men\r\nwere painting now?\r\n\r\n\"It will read _Magellan_,\" said Lockhart, following Burl's eyes. \"We\r\ndecided that that would be the appropriate name for it. For what we are\r\ngoing to have to do with it is not just to make a simple trip to explore\r\nanother planet, but to circumnavigate the entire solar system.\"\r\n\r\nBurl found his eyes dazzled by the vessel, hanging like a giant bulbous\r\nmushroom over them. Around him, he began to realize that a number of\r\nother activities were going on. There were spidery scaffolds leading up\r\nto open ports in the metallic sides. Workmen were raising loads of\r\nmaterial into these ports, and for an instant Burl caught sight of\r\nHaines, in rough work clothes, shouting orders from one of the openings\r\nas to exactly where to stow something.\r\n\r\nAt last he took his eyes away from the startling sight. The little\r\nvalley around him had a number of low storage shacks. A road led in from\r\nanother pass through the mountains. Two loaded trucks came down this\r\npass now in low gear. Lockhart, watching, remarked, \"We are having our\r\nequipment and supplies flown up to a town twenty miles away and then\r\ntrucked in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you leave this ship where it was built--in your plant in\r\nIndiana--and load it from there?\" Burl asked.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been easier,\" said the colonel, \"but security thought it\r\nbetter to transfer the craft to its launching sight up here in these\r\ndeserted hills. We are going to make our take-off from here because we\r\nare still too experimental to know what might happen if something kicked\r\nup or if the engines failed. We'd hate to splatter all over a highly\r\npopulated industrial area. Besides, you must know, if you looked over\r\nthose papers yesterday, that there's a lot of radioactive stuff here.\"\r\n\r\nBurl nodded. Detmar cut in. \"Why don't we get aboard and show him over\r\nthe ship? It will be easier to make it clear that way.\"\r\n\r\nSuiting action to the word, the three went over to one of the loading\r\nplatforms, climbed on the wiry little elevator, and were hoisted up\r\nfifty feet to the port in the side of the ship. They entered well below\r\nthe vast, overhanging equatorial bulge which marked the wide end of the\r\nteardrop-shaped vessel.\r\n\r\nThey walked through a narrow plastic-walled passage, broken in several\r\nplaces by tight, round doors bearing storage vault numbers. At the end\r\nof the passage they came to a double-walled metal air lock. They stepped\r\nthrough and found themselves in what was evidently the living quarters\r\nof the spaceship.\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ was an entirely revolutionary design as far as space\r\nvehicles were concerned. Its odd shape was no mere whimsy, but a\r\npractical model. If a better design were to be invented, it would only\r\ncome out of the practical experiences of this first great flight.\r\n\r\nIt had long been known, ever since Einstein's early equations, that\r\nthere was a kinship between electricity, magnetism, and gravitation. In\r\nelectricity and magnetism there were both negative and positive fields\r\nmanifesting themselves in the form of attraction and repulsion. These\r\nopposing characteristics were the basis for man's mastery of electrical\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nBut for gravitation, there had seemed at first no means of manipulating\r\nit. As it was to develop, this was due to two factors. First, the Earth\r\nitself possessed a gravitational phenomenon in this force outside of\r\nthat intense, all-pervading field. Second, to overcome this primal force\r\nrequired the application of energy on such scales as could not be found\r\noutside of the mastery of nuclear energy.\r\n\r\nThere was a simple parallel, Burl had been told the day before by Sam\r\nOberfield, in the history of aviation. A practical, propeller-driven\r\nflying machine could not be constructed until a motor had been invented\r\nthat was compact, light and powerful enough to operate it. So all\r\nefforts to make such machines prior to the development of the internal\r\ncombustion engine in the first days of the twentieth century were doomed\r\nto failure. Likewise, in this new instance, a machine to utilize\r\ngravitation could not be built until a source of power was developed\r\nhaving the capacity to run it. Such power was found only in the\r\nsuccessful harnessing of the hydrogen disintegration explosion--the\r\nH-bomb force. The first success at channeling this nuclear power in a\r\nnonbomb device had been accomplished in England in 1958. The Zeta-ring\r\ngenerator had been perfected in the next decade.\r\n\r\nOnly this source of harnessed atomic power could supply the force\r\nnecessary to drive an A-G ship.\r\n\r\nThe nose of the _Magellan_ housed an H-power stellar generator. Within\r\nthe bulk of the top third of the ship was this massive power source, its\r\natomic components, its uranium-hydrogen fuel, and the beam that\r\nchanneled the gravitational drive.\r\n\r\n\"Negating gravity is not a simple matter like inventing a magic sheet of\r\nmetal that cuts off the pull of the Earth, such as H. G. Wells wrote\r\nabout,\" Oberfield had explained. \"That is impossible because it ignores\r\nall the other laws of nature; it forgets the power of inertia, it denies\r\nthe facts of mass and density. It takes just as much energy to lift an\r\nanti-gravity ship as to lift a rocketship. The difference is only in the\r\npracticality of the power source. A rocketship must burn its fuel by\r\nchemical explosion in order to push its cargo load upward. Its fuel is\r\nlimited by its own weight and by the awkwardness of its handling. This\r\nA-G ship also must supply energy, foot-pound for foot-pound, for every\r\nfoot it raises the vehicle. But due to the amount of energy supplied by\r\nthis new nuclear generator, such power is at last available in one\r\ncompact form and in such concentration that this ship could propel\r\nitself for hundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain that what then happened was that the vessel,\r\nexerting a tremendous counter-gravitational force, literally pushed\r\nitself up against Earth's drive. At the same time, this force could be\r\nused to intensify the gravitational pull of some other celestial body.\r\nThe vessel would begin to fall toward that other body, and be repelled\r\nfrom the first body--Earth in this case.\r\n\r\nAs every star, planet, and satellite in the universe was exerting a pull\r\non every other one, the anti-gravity spaceship literally reached out,\r\ngrasped hold of the desired gravitational \"rope\" hanging down from the\r\nsky, and pulled itself up it. It would seem to fall upward into the sky.\r\nIt could increase or decrease the effect of its fall. It could fall free\r\ntoward some other world, or it could force an acceleration in its fall\r\nby adding repulsion from the world it was leaving.\r\n\r\nIn flight, therefore, the wide nose was the front. It would fall through\r\nspace, pulled by the power beam generated from this front. The rear of\r\nthe spaceship was the tapering, small end.\r\n\r\nAs Burl was shown over the living quarters it became plain to him that\r\nthe actual living spaces in the _Magellan_ were inside a metal sphere\r\nhanging on gymbals below the equatorial bulge that housed the power\r\ndrive. The bulk of this sphere was always well within the outer walls of\r\nthe teardrop, and thus protected from radiation. Being suspended on\r\ngymbals, the sphere would rotate so that the floor of the living\r\nquarters was always downward to wherever the greatest pull of gravity\r\nmight happen to be.\r\n\r\nBurl and the others explored the three floors that divided the inner\r\nsphere, all oriented toward Earth. The central floor, housing the\r\nsleeping quarters and living quarters, was compact but roomier than\r\nmight have been expected. There were five bunkrooms, each shared by two\r\nmen. There was a main living and dining room. On the lowermost floor was\r\nthe cookroom, a small dispensary, and immediate supplies. On the upper\r\nfloor was the control room, with its charts and television viewplates\r\nwhich allowed vision in all directions from sending plates fixed on the\r\nsurface in various areas.\r\n\r\nIn the spaces between the inner sphere and the outer shell were the\r\nbasic storage areas. Here supplies and equipment were being stocked\r\nagainst all possible emergencies. In the tapering space of the tail\r\nbelow the sphere was a rocket-launching tube. Stored in the outer shells\r\nwere various vehicles for planetary exploration.\r\n\r\nHaines came into the control room where the three were standing. He was\r\nwiping his hands on a piece of cloth, and looked tired. \"Finally got the\r\nspecial, sealed-engine jeep stowed away,\" he said. \"I was afraid we\r\nweren't going to get it in time. The Moon-base people had ordered it,\r\nand they're going to holler bloody murder when they find out we\r\nappropriated it.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart shrugged. \"Let 'em yell. It'll be too late when they find out.\r\nHow much longer will we need before you finish the loading?\"\r\n\r\nHaines drew a chair up to the chart table and sat down. \"I expect to get\r\nsome more stuff tomorrow, and then the two-man rocket plane the next\r\nday. We already have the four-man rocket aboard. That'll do it. The rest\r\nof your men ready?\"\r\n\r\nLockhart nodded. \"We're just about set. Denning here can take a quick\r\ntrip home tomorrow, and we'll be ready the day after.\"\r\n\r\nBurl looked about him quickly. One day, two days, maybe a third--and\r\nthen, the plunge into the unknown. Detmar reached upward and drew down a\r\nmetal ladder hanging in the curved ceiling of the chamber. \"I'm going to\r\ntake a look in the engine room,\" he said. \"Want to come along?\" he asked\r\nBurl.\r\n\r\nBefore the young man could say yes, Lockhart shook his head. \"No, I\r\ndon't want him to. I don't want anyone going up there who doesn't have\r\nto. That stuff is shielded, but you can never be sure.\"\r\n\r\nBurl was disappointed, for he had wanted to see the nuclear generators.\r\nBut Detmar shook his head, smiled, and pushed aside a round trap door in\r\nthe ceiling. Burl could see that it connected with a similar door a foot\r\nhigher. Detmar pushed it open and ascended into the forbidden sphere of\r\nthe Zeta-rings. Burl got a glimpse of subdued, bluish light, and then\r\nthe trap door shut after the engineer.\r\n\r\nLater as they drove out through the valley, Burl looked back at the huge\r\nship, and now, instead of appearing like an overhanging metal waterfall,\r\nhe saw it as a wide-nosed bullet, aiming at the sky, surging against its\r\nbonds--a bullet for humanity's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5. _Up the Rope of Space_\r\n\r\n\r\nBurl's visit home was a curious interlude. Actually, he had been away\r\nonly a few weeks, since the summer vacation had begun, yet this single\r\nday had an air about it different from that of any other homecoming. He\r\nfound himself continually looking at things in a more inquisitive, more\r\nthoughtful manner.\r\n\r\nThat which had been commonplace was suddenly something valuable, a sight\r\nto be treasured. For he had realized, as he sat in the fast plane\r\ntransporting him home, that the Earth was itself a planet among planets,\r\nand that this might possibly prove to be his last visit to the town\r\nwhere he had been born. He had pondered, as he had gazed out of the\r\nship's windows, just what it could mean to depart from this world and\r\ntravel among the uncharted reaches of empty and hostile space ... to\r\nset foot upon planets where no human foot had ever touched and to meet\r\nunguessable perils.\r\n\r\nSo his home, his mother, his friends, the street on which he lived, took\r\non a novel air. He studied them while enjoying a quiet day at home. He\r\nwatched the cars in the street, so amusingly compact and small, each\r\ndesigned in the fleeting style of the year. The cars of a dozen years\r\nago had been designed for length and size, but the trend had been the\r\nopposite for a decade now. The cars grew smaller and their lines weirder\r\nas the manufacturers strove to compete.\r\n\r\nWhat other planet could boast of such simultaneously astonishing\r\ningenuity and wondrous tomfoolery?\r\n\r\nHe looked at the people going about their business, the other boys of\r\nhis age intent on their summer jobs and summer fun, and wondered if he\r\nwould ever be able to join them again without the cares of a world on\r\nhis shoulders?\r\n\r\nPeople were unaware of the crisis that hung over the solar system. There\r\nhad been news of the dimming of the Sun, but the meaning behind it had\r\nbeen carefully screened, and the expedition was a top secret. It availed\r\nthe world nothing to panic about this matter. Now the odd weather quirks\r\nhad been forgotten, and the main subjects on people's tongues were the\r\nbaseball scores and the latest telemovies.\r\n\r\nWhen Burl kissed his mother and father good-by, it was with a sense that\r\nhe was also kissing good-by to his youth, and entering upon a new\r\nperiod of the most desperate responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis mood lingered with him back at the base, although his companions of\r\nthe trip to come seemingly did not share it. On the last day, quarters\r\nhad been assigned in the _Magellan_, and the men moved their belongings\r\nto their tight bunks in the heart of the ship. Clyde had his way, and he\r\nand Burl shared a double-decker chamber.\r\n\r\nThere was a hustle and bustle in the valley. The supplies seemed\r\nunending, and Burl wondered why the variety. \"For once, we've got\r\nlifting power to spare,\" was Russ's comment. \"Nobody knows what we're\r\ngoing to need on the various planets, so Lockhart is simply piling\r\naboard everything he can think of. You'd be amazed at the space we have\r\nfor storage. And Caton says that the more we stick in there, the better\r\nthe shielding is against the radiation belt surrounding Earth--and\r\nprobably the other planets as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we were already well protected,\" said Burl. \"With the atomic\r\ngenerators, we had to be shielded anyway. Haven't we lead lining all\r\naround our inner sphere quarters?\"\r\n\r\nRussell Clyde nodded. \"Oh, sure, but the more the merrier.\"\r\n\r\nHe and Burl were already in their quarters, stowing their clothes. \"We\r\nleave in an hour,\" said Burl. \"Are we going to the launching base at\r\nBoothia, where the manned rockets go up?\"\r\n\r\nClyde shook his head. \"Lockhart talked it over with us yesterday, and we\r\ndecided to take off from right here.\" By \"us,\" Burl knew the operational\r\ngroup was meant, which consisted of the colonel, the two astronomers,\r\nCaton as head of the engineering section, and Haines, \"To tell the\r\ntruth, nobody knows how easily this ship will handle. We're shielded\r\nwell enough so that a short passage through the radiation belt three\r\nhundred miles up and for the next fifteen hundred miles shouldn't have\r\nany effect on us at all. The rockets, which can't be shielded because of\r\nthe weight limitations, have to go up at Boothia because there, at the\r\nNorth Magnetic Pole, there's a hole in the radiation.\"\r\n\r\nBoothia Peninsula was a barren spot far up in the Arctic Zone on\r\nCanada's frozen eastern coast. On it was constructed the world's major\r\nspace port--a lonely outpost from which rockets departed for the equally\r\nlonely Moon bases. Burl had read about it and had looked forward to\r\nseeing it, but realized that the flight of the _Magellan_ marked still\r\nanother change in the fast-altering history of the conquest of space.\r\n\r\nThe hour passed quickly. The little valley was cleared of visitors. The\r\ncrew was called to take-off posts--Lockhart at the controls, Clyde and\r\nOberfield at the charts, Detmar watching the energy output. The rest of\r\nthe crew had been strapped into their bunks. By special request, Burl\r\nwas observing in the control room, seated in a half-reclining position\r\nlike the others, in a well-padded chair, strapped tight.\r\n\r\nHaines had remarked as he had supervised the strapping-in, \"Nobody knows\r\nwhether this is going to be necessary. But we're taking no chances.\"\r\nHe'd gone to his quarters and done the same thing.\r\n\r\nLockhart watched the registering of the dials in front of him, waiting\r\nfor the load to build up. There was a muffled whine from overhead as the\r\ngenerators built up current. Detmar called out a cryptic number every\r\nfew seconds and the colonel checked it. The two astronomers were idle,\r\nwatching their viewers. They'd made their calculations long before.\r\n\r\n\"Time,\" called out the colonel, pressing a button. A gong rang\r\nthroughout the quarters. He moved a lever slowly.\r\n\r\nBurl waited for the surge of pressure he had read always occurred at\r\ntake-off. But there was no such pressure. He lay back in his seat,\r\ngripping the arms. Gradually he became aware of a curious sensation. He\r\nseemed to be getting lightheaded, and to tingle with unexpected energy.\r\nHe felt an impulse to giggle, and he kicked up his foot to find it\r\nsurprisingly agile. About him the others were stirring in their seats as\r\nif caught by the same impulses.\r\n\r\nNow he felt loose against his bonds and he became a little dizzy. There\r\nwas a pounding in his head as blood surged within him. His heart began\r\nto beat heavily.\r\n\r\n\"We're losing weight,\" muttered Clyde from his chair, and Burl knew the\r\nship was tensing to take off.\r\n\r\nThe great generators were beginning to push against Earth's gravity\r\nand, as their force moved upward to match Earth's, the weight of\r\neverything in their sway decreased accordingly. Lockhart's first move\r\nwas simply that--to reduce the pull of Earth to zero.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments that point was accomplished. A state of weightlessness\r\nwas obtained within the _Magellan_. Those watching outside from bunkers\r\nin the surrounding mountains saw the huge teardrop shiver and begin to\r\nrise slowly above its cradle of girders. It floated gently upward,\r\nmoving slowly off as the force of Earth's centrifugal drive began to\r\nmanifest itself against the metal bubble's great mass.\r\n\r\nEveryone on the crew had experienced zero gravity, either in the same\r\ntests Burl had undergone or on actual satellite flights, and thus far,\r\nno one was too uncomfortable. The entire structure of the ship quivered,\r\nand Burl realized that the inner sphere which housed their air space was\r\nhanging free on its gymbals.\r\n\r\nLockhart rang a second gong, then turned a new control. The pitch of the\r\ngenerators, faintly audible to them, changed, took on a new keening. The\r\nship seemed suddenly to jump as if something had grasped it. The feeling\r\nof weightlessness vanished momentarily, then there was a moment of\r\ndizziness and a sudden sensation of being upside down.\r\n\r\nFor a shocking instant, Burl felt himself hanging head downward from a\r\nfloor which had surprisingly turned into a ceiling. He opened his mouth\r\nto shout, for he thought he was about to plunge onto the hard metal of\r\nthe ceiling which now hung below him so precipitously.\r\n\r\nThen there was a whirling sensation, a sideways twisting that swung him\r\nabout against the straps. As it came, the room seemed to shift. The\r\ncurved base of the control room, which had been so suddenly a floor,\r\nbecame in a moment a wall, lopsided and eerie. Then it shifted again,\r\nand, startlingly, Burl sagged back into his cushioned seat as the\r\nhemispherical room again resumed its normal aspect.\r\n\r\nLockhart bent over the controls, cautiously moving a lever bit by bit.\r\nClyde was bent over his viewer, calling out slight corrections.\r\n\r\nNow, at last, Burl felt the pressure he had expected. His weight grew\r\nsteadily greater, back to normal, then increased. He found himself\r\nconcentrating on his breathing, forcing his lungs up against the\r\nincreasing weight of his ribs.\r\n\r\n\"Hold up,\" his buzzing eardrums heard someone say--possibly Oberfield.\r\n\"We don't need to accelerate more than one g. Take it easy.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight lessened instantly. Then the pressure was off. Everything\r\nseemed normal. Lockhart sat back and began to unloosen his straps. The\r\nothers followed suit.\r\n\r\nIn one viewer, Burl glimpsed the black of outer space, and in another,\r\nthe wide grayish-green bowl of the Earth spreading out below. In a third\r\nhe saw the blazing disc of the Sun.\r\n\r\n\"Did everything go all right?\" he asked quietly of Clyde.\r\n\r\nThe redhead looked up at him and smiled. \"Better than we might have\r\nexpected for a first flight,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We're latching on to the Sun's grip now. We're falling toward the Sun;\r\nnot just falling, but pulling ourselves faster toward it, so that we can\r\nkeep up a normal gravity pressure. We're soon going to be going faster\r\nthan any rocket has ever gone. The living-space sphere rotated itself as\r\nsoon as we started that. That's what made everything seem upside down\r\nthat time and why everything has come back to normal.\"\r\n\r\nBurl nodded. \"But that means that in relation to Earth we are ourselves\r\nupside down right now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Clyde. \"But in space, everything is strictly relative.\r\nWe are no longer on Earth. We are a separate body in space, falling\r\nthrough space toward the Sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the Sun?\" asked Burl. \"I thought our first objective was to be the\r\nplanet Venus?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was too hard to get a fix on Venus from so near the Earth. Instead,\r\nwe latched on to the Sun to pull us inward. When we are near to Venus'\r\norbit, we'll reverse and pull in on Venus,\" was the astronomer's answer.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that rather risky?\" asked Burl, remembering some of the quick\r\nbriefings he had been given. \"That's a departure from your plans.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart looked up quickly. \"Yes, you're right,\" he admitted. \"But on a\r\ntrip like this we've got to learn to improvise and do it fast. We made\r\nthat decision at take-off.\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant Burl felt a chill. He realized then what all the other\r\nmen on the ship had known all along--that in this flight they were all\r\namateurs, that everything they did was to be improvisation in one way or\r\nanother, that they must always run the risk of a terrible mistake.\r\n\r\nHad latching on to the Sun been the first such error?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6. _Sunward Ho!_\r\n\r\n\r\nGradually the ship settled down to routine. There was, as Burl\r\ndiscovered, nothing very much to do for most of the crew on such a space\r\nflight. The course was charted in advance, a pattern laid out that would\r\ncarry the ship falling toward its objective--falling in a narrow curving\r\norbit. A certain amount of time would pass during which the ship would\r\ntraverse a specific section of this plotted route at a certain rate of\r\nspeed or acceleration.\r\n\r\nThen, at a specified moment, the speed would be checked, the attraction\r\nof the Sun reversed, and the ship would attempt to brake itself and to\r\nhalt its fall toward the great Sun. At such a time as its fall came to a\r\nstop, it should, if the calculations had been correct, be crossing the\r\norbit of the planet Venus in the same place and at about the same moment\r\nthat Venus itself would be. In that way, the ship would arrive at the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nNow all these calculations had been made, and once made, set into motion\r\non the control panels of the ship. The interval of many days between\r\nactually left little to do, except for making astronomical observations,\r\nchecking on the performance of the stellarators, setting a watch against\r\nthe damage caused by meteors and micro-meteors, and following the\r\nordinary procedures of meals and sleep periods. The men set up an\r\nEarth-time schedule of twenty-four hours, divided the crew into three\r\neight-hour shifts, and conducted themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\nBurl did not find time weighing on his hands. Despite the limited space\r\navailable to the ten men, there was always something to learn, and\r\nsomething to think about.\r\n\r\nWhen Russell Clyde was off duty, he spent much time with Burl at the\r\nwide-screen viewers that showed the black depths of interplanetary space\r\nsurrounding them. The Earth dwindled to a brilliant green disc, while\r\nahead of them the narrow crescent of approaching Venus could be seen\r\ngrowing gradually. Ruddy Mars was sharp but tiny, a point of russet\r\nbeyond the green of Earth. And the stars--never had Burl seen so many\r\nstars--a firmament ablaze with brilliant little points of light--the\r\nmillions of suns of the galaxy and the galaxies beyond ours.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the side toward which they fell, the Sun was a\r\nblinding sphere of white light, its huge coronal flames wavering\r\nfearfully around its orb.\r\n\r\nSeen to one side, surprisingly close to the Sun, was a tiny half-moon.\r\n\"That's Mercury,\" said Russ, pointing it out. \"The smallest planet and\r\nthe closest to the Sun. After we leave Venus, we'll have to visit it. We\r\nknow there's a Sun-tap station there--and because it's so close to the\r\nSun--its orbit ranges between twenty-eight million miles and under\r\nforty-four million miles--the station must be a most important and large\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nBurl gazed at the point of light that was the innermost planet. \"Those\r\nSun-tap stations ... The more I think about it, the more I wonder what\r\nwe're up against. It seems to me that it ought to be easy for the kind\r\nof people who can build such things to catch us and stop us. In fact, I\r\nwonder why they haven't already gone after us for stopping the one on\r\nEarth?\"\r\n\r\nRuss whistled softly between his teeth. \"We've some ideas about that.\r\nThe military boys worked on it. You know you can figure out a lot of\r\nthings from just a few bits of evidence. We have such evidence from what\r\nhappened to you on Earth. You ought to speak to Haines about it.\"\r\n\r\nBurl turned away from the viewer. \"Let's find him now. I don't think\r\nhe's very busy. He said something about catching up on his reading this\r\nperiod.\"\r\n\r\nRuss nodded, and the two of them got up from their seat. With a wave to\r\nOberfield and Caton on duty at the controls, the two climbed down the\r\nladder that led into the middle part of the living space. They looked\r\ninto Haines's quarters but he wasn't there. So they went down the next\r\nhatchway into the lower section.\r\n\r\nHaines and Ferrati were sitting at a table in the cooking quarters,\r\ndrinking coffee. The two men, both heavy and muscular, used to the open\r\nspaces and the feel of the winds, were taking the enforced confinement\r\nin the cramped and artificially oxygenated space of the ship with ill\r\nease. For them, it was like a stretch in jail.\r\n\r\nThey greeted the two younger men jovially and invited them to a seat.\r\nWhile Russ poured a cup of coffee for himself, Burl opened the subject\r\nof how much the expedition had worked out about the enemy.\r\n\r\nHaines's pale blue eyes gleamed. \"You can know an awful lot about an\r\nenemy if you know what he didn't do as well as what he did do. If you\r\nfigure out what you yourself should have done under the same\r\ncircumstances, and know he didn't do, why, that gives you some valuable\r\nhints as to his deficiencies. As we see it, we've got a fighting chance\r\nof spoiling his game. Certainly of spoiling it long enough to allow\r\nEarth several more years to get a fleet of ships like this into\r\noperation and give him plenty of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Burl felt more cheerful. At the back of his mind there had been\r\na carefully concealed point of cold terror--he remembered the clean\r\nefficiency of the Sun-tap station, the evidence of a science far beyond\r\nthat of Earth. He pressed the point. \"Just what do we really know?\"\r\n\r\nHaines leaned back and rubbed his hands together. \"There were several\r\nthings that gave their weaknesses away. When we put it all together, we\r\ndecided that the enemy represents some sort of limited advanced force or\r\nscouting group of a civilization still too far away to count in the\r\nimmediate future. We decided that the enemy isn't too aware of our\r\npresent abilities--that his intelligence service is poor as far as\r\nmodern Earth is concerned. We figure he won't be able to act with any\r\nspeed to repair the damages we make.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them how we worked that out,\" said Ferrati, who had begun to grow\r\nagain the short black beard that Burl remembered he had worn on his\r\nfamous expeditions.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Haines, drawing the word out to build up suspense, \"did you\r\nknow that the station in the Andes, the one you cracked open, was built\r\nat least thirty years ago? And never put into operation in all that\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\nBurl was surprised. \"Why ... I hadn't thought of it--but it could have\r\nbeen. That valley was so isolated and deserted, probably nobody would\r\never have spotted it.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Haines added, \"and our investigation team studied the remains,\r\nthe foundations, the layout, and we're sure it's been there at least\r\nthree decades. That's one clue.\r\n\r\n\"The second clue was the relative flimsiness of the walls. The builders\r\nhadn't expected us to be able to blow them up. They were some sort of\r\nquick construction--a plastic, strong, but not able to hold up against\r\nblasting powder, let alone real heavy bombs or A-bombs.\r\n\r\n\"Now why was that? And the third clue, why didn't they have a repair\r\nsystem available, or at least some sort of automatic antiaircraft\r\ndefense?\"\r\n\r\nBurl looked at Ferrati. The latter was watching him shrewdly to see if\r\nhe could figure it out.\r\n\r\n\"The builders didn't expect an air attack,\" said Burl slowly, \"because\r\nof the air disturbances. They did not know we would have a Moon base\r\nthat could spot their location. Hence they figured that our civilization\r\nwould remain as it was thirty years ago. We wouldn't have been able to\r\nspot the location at that time, because it required outer-space\r\nobservation. It might have taken us several years of tramping around to\r\nlocate it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the lack of a strong permanent construction? After all, a concrete\r\nand steel-enforced embankment, which any military force on Earth could\r\nhave put there, would have balked your dynamite attack,\" probed Haines.\r\n\r\n\"That means they didn't have the time or the means to make such a\r\nconstruction. They must have had a single ship with the kind of\r\nequipment that could lay out a quick base in the shortest time!\" said\r\nBurl.\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" snapped Haines. \"The Sun-tap must have been built by a\r\nrelatively small team, which probably came in a single explorer ship.\r\nThe ship was equipped with automatic factory machinery that could turn\r\nout an adequate base for an uninhabited planet, an airless moon, and so\r\non--but they didn't have the stuff for a fortified base--and they didn't\r\nhave the manpower to build it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another indication of that is the thirty-year delay,\" added Ferrati.\r\n\"Obviously, they arrived in this solar system from somewhere outside it.\r\nWe figure that way because otherwise they would have been prepared to do\r\nthe job on all the planets in the same trip and start operations at\r\nonce. They must have made some observations of this solar system from a\r\npoint in space at least as far away as another star. That means not less\r\nthan four and a half light-years away--Proxima Centauri being the\r\nnearest star after our Sun, and four and a half light-years from us.\r\nTheir observations were imperfect. They found more planets and problems\r\nthan they had supposed. So they had to make a second trip to get enough\r\nsupplies to finish their Sun-tap base constructions. It took them thirty\r\nyears between the first stations and the ones that completed the job.\r\n\r\n\"And that, too, suggests that only one ship was originally involved\r\nhere. Of course, maybe they came back with more the second time, but it\r\nstill looks as if the main force hasn't arrived. And won't, until after\r\nthe Sun novas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that means,\" said Burl quickly, \"that we are still dealing with\r\njust a small and isolated group?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Haines. \"Just what constitutes a small group may be hard\r\nto say. I rather think they'd have brought the engineers and at least an\r\nadvance working party of settlers with them the second trip in. But\r\nthey are still short of available ships--they're still not aware of what\r\nwe may be going to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is that?\" asked Burl.\r\n\r\nHaines looked thoughtful. \"This is conjecture. But if they planted any\r\nspies among our Earth people, there's been no contact, because otherwise\r\nthey'd have known we could track and crack their base as soon as it\r\nstarted. This means that they still haven't had scouting ships to spare\r\nfor checking up on what they did the first time. No checkup means no\r\nspare personnel to do the checking. They just assumed that we hadn't\r\ncaught on, and started operations by remote control as they had\r\noriginally planned.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that also may mean that these people are hard up,\" said Ferrati.\r\n\"Wherever they came from, their civilization has been great, but it's\r\ngone to seed. They plan to seize another solar system, start over again,\r\nand they haven't the manpower to do an adequate job--and they haven't\r\nthe abundance of material needed to set up simple check and guard\r\nstations, such as any major Earth nation would have the sense to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that means we've got a fighting chance to lick 'em,\" said Burl\r\njoyfully. \"I kept thinking we'd run into more than we could cope with.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got a fighting chance, all right,\" said Haines. \"We may be able\r\nto rip up their Sun-tap layouts, but what if we meet the main explorer\r\nship itself? Anybody who can cross interstellar space and warp the power\r\nof the Sun, can probably outshoot, outrun, and outfight us. Let's hope\r\nwe don't meet them until we've done our work.\"\r\n\r\nOn this note the little discussion broke up as the gong rang for the\r\nnext watch.\r\n\r\nIt made sense to Burl. If the _Magellan_ could just operate fast enough,\r\nkeep on the jump, they'd save the day. But--and he realized that nobody\r\nhad mentioned it aloud--it also followed that the enemy--however small\r\nits group--was still in the solar system somewhere and would certainly\r\nbe starting to take action very soon now.\r\n\r\nThe time came when the ship was to start slowing, to prepare itself for\r\nthe meeting with Venus. Burl saw the hour and minute approach and\r\nwatched Lockhart take the controls and set the new readings. The steady\r\nhum of the generators--a vibration that had become a constant feature of\r\nthe ship--altered, and for everyone it was a relief. Their minds had\r\nbecome attuned to the steady pitch. One didn't realize how annoying a\r\nnuisance it was until it stopped. As the stellar generators let down on\r\nthe drag on the Sun, the gravity within the ship lessened. In a few\r\nmoments there was a condition of zero, and those who had forgotten to\r\nstrap themselves down found that they were floating about in the air,\r\nmost of them giddy.\r\n\r\nThere was a shift in the pitch, and the generators applied repulsion\r\nagainst the pull of the Sun. Those floating in the air crashed suddenly\r\nagainst the ceiling, then slid violently down the walls onto the floor\r\nas the inner sphere rotated on its gymbals to meet the new center of\r\ngravitational pull--this time away from the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe viewers flickered off and then on again as their connecting surfaces\r\ninside and outside the sphere's double layer of walls slid apart and\r\nmatched up again. For an instant, as he saw the viewers blank out, Burl\r\nthought of what might happen if the sphere didn't rotate all the way.\r\nThey would find themselves blind.\r\n\r\nNow the ship proceeded on its charted orbit, slowing to meet Venus.\r\nSeveral hours went by, one meal, and Burl had returned to his bunk, his\r\nrest period having arrived. Russ remained at the controls on duty,\r\nchecking astronomically the new speed and deceleration.\r\n\r\nBurl tossed restlessly, the light out in the little cabin. Something was\r\nbothering him, and after a while he realized that Clyde should have come\r\noff duty before this. He glanced at the clock and calculated that Russ\r\nwas two hours overdue. What was wrong?\r\n\r\nHe slipped out of his bunk and climbed into his pants. Ascending into\r\nthe control room, he saw Lockhart, the two astronomers, and the entire\r\nengineering crew gathered over the controls in worried concentration.\r\n\r\nHe peered over their shoulders, but the dials meant little to him, since\r\nhe did not know what they should have said. \"What's happened?\" he asked\r\nRuss.\r\n\r\nRuss took him aside. \"We're not going to make our connection with\r\nVenus,\" he said. \"Our generators didn't operate exactly as we had hoped.\r\nWe haven't been able to slow down enough, the pull of the Sun is\r\nstronger than the power we can raise to stop it at our present speed.\r\nWe're going to shoot past Venus' orbit way ahead of the planet, and\r\nwe're still heading sunward at a faster rate than we figured on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--we're falling into the Sun!\" gasped Burl.\r\n\r\n\"As things stand right now,\" said the youthful astrogator, \"that's just\r\nwhat is happening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7. _Hot Spot on Mercury_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange to Burl at that moment that there wasn't more\r\nexcitement on board the _Magellan_. To learn so early in the game that\r\nall were doomed should have brought more reaction. It should have\r\nexcited some sort of frenzy, or efforts to abandon ship, or something.\r\nBut the men in the cabin, though keyed up, were anything but panicky.\r\n\r\nInstead, there seemed to be grim concentration on their faces, an\r\nearnestness that spoke of a plan. Through a viewer which had been\r\nshielded so that the light would not blind the eyes, Burl could see the\r\nwide disc of the Sun now. A few spots were visible on its blazing\r\nsurface, and great tongues of burning gases encircled it for hundreds of\r\nthousands of miles. Were they really destined to end a mere cinder--an\r\ninstantaneous flicker of fire in one of those prominences?\r\n\r\nClyde was working with Oberfield at the calculators. Burl watched them\r\nin silence, trying to determine what it was they were getting at.\r\nFinally they pulled a figure from one of their machines and took it over\r\nto Lockhart and the engineers. There was a brief conference, and\r\nsomething seemed to be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nClyde's face, which had been tense, was now more relaxed. \"I think we've\r\ngot the problem licked,\" came the good word.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" asked Burl. \"If we shoot past Venus, we should still be\r\nable to come to a stop, fall away from the Sun and maybe catch up with\r\nVenus again. It would take longer, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"We're altering our plans,\" interrupted Russ. \"Of course, we could\r\nbrake--that much we found out for sure. The trouble lay in our lack of\r\neffective tests for the _Magellan's_ drive. We thought we knew just what\r\nit would do, but after all, the problems of space are intricate. It\r\nturned out that it did not act so effectively against the Sun as had\r\nbeen calculated. Either that, or the Sun's pull was stronger at this\r\nproximity than registered on our instruments. Chasing after Venus, after\r\ncoming back to its orbit, could be done, but it would prove\r\ntime-consuming and difficult to plan. What we are doing instead is\r\naltering our schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then there's no other place to go from here but Mercury. Is that\r\nwhat the new plan is?\" Burl asked him.\r\n\r\nRuss nodded. \"Mercury is coming around this side of the Sun. By the time\r\nwe have braked, we will be closer to its orbit than to that of Venus. So\r\nwe shall proceed inward toward it and make our first planetfall there.\"\r\n\r\nMercury, the smallest and hottest planet in the system. Burl remembered\r\nthat it was one of the two worlds that they knew for sure had a Sun-tap\r\nstation on it. He went down the hatch to carry the news to the landing\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nHaines, Burl discovered, had already heard the new plan on the intercom\r\nfrom Lockhart. As soon as Burl joined them, the four men, including\r\nFerrati and Boulton, went into a planning session.\r\n\r\nThe problem of Mercury was a hard one. As Ferrati remarked, \"It would\r\nhave been better to tackle this one last instead of taking it on first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but on the other hand,\" was Haines's comment, \"Mercury's station\r\nis probably one of the most important--located as it is, so close to the\r\nSun. With ideal conditions for steady, undiverted concentration of solar\r\npower, it must be the primary station in the system.\"\r\n\r\n\"The problem boils down--and I do mean 'boils'--to heat,\" Boulton\r\nlaughed. \"Mercury rotates on its axis only once a year--its year being\r\nonly eighty-eight of our days long. This means that just as the Moon\r\npresents only one side to the Earth, Mercury always presents the same\r\nhemisphere to the Sun. On the Sun side, therefore, there is always day.\r\nThe Sun appears to be fixed in the sky. Naturally, we assume the Sun-tap\r\nstation will be on that sunny side. And the heat must be terrific.\"\r\n\r\n\"Matter of fact,\" said Haines dryly, \"the records show the heat in the\r\ncenter of the Sun side reaches 770° Fahrenheit. Enough to keep tin and\r\nlead molten.\"\r\n\r\n\"The problem is how to reach the station over such a boiling landscape,\"\r\nsummed up Burl. \"It seems to me that the absence of an atmosphere could\r\nanswer part of the problem.\"\r\n\r\nHaines nodded. \"Let's get to work on a plan of action, men. We've got a\r\nfew days to get our equipment laid out.\"\r\n\r\nThose few days passed quickly enough. When several possible schemes had\r\nbeen outlined, the men made lists of the types of equipment that might\r\nbe used with each. Then, putting on pressurized space suits and carrying\r\nair tanks, they left the inner sphere and worked through the cargo space\r\nsurrounding it within the outer frame of the spaceship. There had\r\noriginally been air here, but now they found most of it was gone,\r\nthinned out from infinitely tiny leaks in the outer shell caused by the\r\nconstant bombardment of microscopic bits of meteoric dust.\r\n\r\nThey located each piece of equipment and moved it into position for easy\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\nThe ship came to its halting point, where the repulsion against the Sun\r\nfinally braked it against the gravitational pull of the Sun. Then, by\r\nincreasing the selective pull of the approaching planet Mercury, they\r\nmoved off in that direction.\r\n\r\nMercury was changing in appearance. As they neared it from the outer\r\nside, its lighted half swung away from their view, and what they saw was\r\na constantly narrowing crescent, growing larger even as it narrowed.\r\nFinally the hour came when they swung up close, coming in on the\r\neternally sunless, night side of the little planet.\r\n\r\nThey swooped low over the dark surface, taking observations and\r\nmeasurements. \"It's not as cold as we might suppose,\" said Oberfield\r\nafter his first readings. \"There's a certain amount of heat all along\r\nthe rim of the dark side. Radiation, I suppose, as well as the fact that\r\nthere's a certain amount of wobbling done by the planet.\"\r\n\r\nBurl was studying the surface. \"Seems to me that much of the dark side\r\nhas a gleam to it. Something reflects the stars; I see little glints of\r\nlight, shifting and blinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can guess what that is,\" said Russ. \"It must be covered, at least in\r\nthe central portions, with a sea of frozen gases. What atmosphere\r\nMercury had long ago must have congealed there.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship moved along toward the twilight edge, then began circling the\r\nplanet along that intermediate belt, where the Sun could be seen peeking\r\nover the horizon in eternal dawn. There was a cluster of men at the\r\nradiation counter, looking for evidence of the Sun-tap station.\r\nFinally, after passing over a chain of darkened mountains, eerily\r\nlighted at the peaks by the Sun, there came a yell. Distortion had been\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nOnce on it, they swung the ship outward into space again and moved along\r\nfurther over the sunlit side. Burl stared into the telescopic viewers as\r\nthey probed the surface.\r\n\r\nHe saw an ugly and terrifying world. The planet, which had a diameter of\r\nonly 3,100 miles, compared to Earth's 7,900, was virtually without an\r\natmosphere. Its surface was baked hard, brilliantly white, covered with\r\nlong, deep cracks that cut hundreds of miles into the shriveled and\r\nburned surface. There were areas of dark mountain ranges, bare and\r\njagged, whose metallic surfaces imparted a darker shade to the pervading\r\nglare. And there were patches here and there on the surface that gleamed\r\nbalefully--probably spots of molten material.\r\n\r\nHaines, standing next to him, was muttering, \"It can't be too far in, it\r\ncan't. How could they build it?\"\r\n\r\nThen Burl found what they were looking for.\r\n\r\nA huge canyon tore raggedly across a plain. There was a jumble of\r\nmountains, a chain edging in from the twilight zone. And in a corner,\r\nabout two hundred miles out into the hot side, at a narrow ledge where\r\nthe mountains came down and the canyon came together, there was a\r\ncircular structure.\r\n\r\nThey could see, as soon as the telescopic sight had been adjusted, that\r\nit was a large station. It was encircled by a featureless wall. It had\r\nno roof. Rising on masts above it was a whole forest of gleaming discs\r\npointing at the Sun low in the sky.\r\n\r\nOn the tops of the mountain peaks, a half mile from the station, was\r\nanother series of masts. These were aimed away from the Sun into the\r\ndark airless sky and toward the other planets.\r\n\r\n\"The accumulators and the transmitters,\" said Burl. \"We'll have to get\r\nthem both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting the transmitters will be easy,\" said Haines. \"After we shut off\r\nthe station, we'll just bomb the mountain masts out of action.\"\r\n\r\nBurl choked. \"Why, it never occurred to me, but why can't we bomb the\r\nstation from the air? One atomic bomb should finish it off.\" He almost\r\nadded, And you wouldn't have needed me after all, but squashed the\r\nthought. He wouldn't have given up coming along for anything, he now\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\n\"There's a distortion, as there was at the Andes station, that would\r\nmake it hard to hit. But I imagine we could do it if we tried hard\r\nenough. But that isn't what we want at first. It's important, very\r\nimportant, that we get pictures and details of this station from inside.\r\nWe can't just break up the enemy installations--we've got to learn from\r\nthem, we must find out how they do it and how we can use it.\" This was\r\nLockhart speaking. \"You'd better start the job,\" he added to Haines.\r\n\"Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\nHaines nodded reluctantly. \"Yep,\" and turning to the three who would\r\naccompany him, he ordered, \"let's go.\"\r\n\r\nThe four explorers gathered near the exit port. They had put on space\r\nsuits and strapped on various items of equipment, weapons and work\r\ntools. They passed through the airlock into the cargo section of the\r\nship. Communicating through the helmet radios, Haines directed each what\r\nto do, and also directed Lockhart where to bring the ship for the\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nBurl heard Lockhart's voice warn them that he did not want to hold the\r\nship too long over the sunny hot side. \"We've already noticed a buildup\r\nof heat from the solar radiation on the skin. And the heat radiating\r\nfrom Mercury is accumulating too fast. We can't get rid of it if _both_\r\nsides of this ship are going to be heated up. As soon as you make your\r\nlanding, I'm taking the ship back to the cold side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh,\" came Haines's voice. \"We don't want to hang around here any\r\ntoo long, either.\"\r\n\r\nThen the four, as prearranged, unlimbered the work rocket they had\r\npicked. There were several sizes of small exploration craft. They had at\r\nfirst thought of the tractor--an enclosed, airtight truck on tractor\r\nwheels which could crawl up to the station while the men inside it were\r\nprotected by air conditioning. But a quick survey showed that it would\r\noverheat too fast and might easily bog down in one of the many soft\r\nspots. So they took the four-man, rocket-propelled cargo plane instead.\r\n\r\nThe ship was airtight and pressurized. They had taken every precaution.\r\nThe four piled in with their supplies. Then, as the _Magellan_ swooped\r\nmomentarily lower, the escape hatch opened and, with Ferrati at the\r\ncontrols, the rocket plane shot out with a roar of its exhausts.\r\n\r\nThey raced low over the burning landscape, and before them the wide,\r\ndark, forbidding canyon cut its way through the plain. It was into this\r\ncanyon that the rocket plunged.\r\n\r\nThe precipitous rocky sides rose above them, and suddenly they were in\r\ndarkness. Immediately, the plane's cooling system became more effective\r\nas Ferrati guided the rocket through the shadowy depths away from the\r\nblazing sunbeams. Burl saw, by means of the radar, that the bottom of\r\nthe heat crack was many miles down.\r\n\r\nThey raced along the crevice until they reached the mountain chain.\r\nHere, Ferrati abruptly raised the nose of the plane and they shot\r\nupward, popping out of the shadow into the sunlight.\r\n\r\nBefore them loomed the hard unbroken walls of the Sun-tap station. The\r\nrocket plane came to a stop a hundred feet away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had halted, Burl and Ferrati leaped out, with white sheets\r\nthrown over their suits to afford some extra protection from the Sun's\r\nrays. Between them they carried a long, awkward affair of poles and\r\nplastic.\r\n\r\nBurl's feet touched the ground; through the cushioned leather of his\r\nthick boots he felt the heat just as if he had stepped on a hot stove.\r\nHe moved quickly, and as they had rehearsed, he and the explorer slapped\r\nthe rig together and set up a gleaming plastic skin sunbreak to shield\r\nthe rocket plane. The plastic sheets reflected the Sun's heat and cut\r\noff a fair portion of the direct radiation which would otherwise have\r\nrendered the rocket plane inoperable and uninhabitable in short order.\r\n\r\nWhile they were assembling the sunbreak, Haines and Boulton unloaded a\r\nportable antitank rocket launcher. With no wasted motion, Boulton aimed\r\nthe launcher at the wall, and Haines thrust a long, wicked-looking\r\nrocket projectile into the tube. There was a flash of soundless fire and\r\na line of dissipating white smoke. Nothing could be heard in the\r\nairlessness.\r\n\r\nBurl felt the shock through the ground as the shell hit. A chunk of the\r\nwall ripped apart and collapsed.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as he saw it, Burl acted. Haines's voice rang in his ear, but\r\nalready Burl was in action. Back into the rocket plane, out again\r\nwith--an umbrella!\r\n\r\nHe made a flying leap toward the Sun-tap station. He felt terrifically\r\nstrong in the slight gravity, and the leap carried him thirty feet\r\nforward. As he slid through the space above the surface, he opened the\r\numbrella. Its outer side had been painted white, and partly shielded him\r\nfrom the direct heat. He made the station in five leaps and climbed\r\nthrough the broken wall. Boulton followed him with another umbrella and\r\na pack under his arm.\r\n\r\nInside the station it was cool--the walls had been high enough to create\r\nshade within. It was like the station in the Andes, but bigger, much\r\nbigger.\r\n\r\nBoulton joined him, folded his umbrella calmly, and yanked an\r\nair-compression pistol from his belt. \"See anyone?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nBurl remembered then that there could possibly be a living guard at this\r\nstation. They searched carefully, but there was no sign of life. Boulton\r\nwas doing a soldier's job, that was all.\r\n\r\nWhile Boulton set up his photographic equipment, Burl made his way\r\naround the shining globes and strange tubes that were the nerve center\r\nof the station. He finally found the same type of control panel that he\r\nhad found in the Andes station.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated before it, wondering if, after all, this, the original\r\ncharge, would work. He hoped that there might be another charger globe\r\navailable, but saw none. It would be up to him.\r\n\r\nHe put a gloved hand on the control. Perhaps, he worried, the charge\r\nwould not conduct through the insulated, cooled material of his suit. He\r\npushed the levers, and knew then that it did.\r\n\r\nThe pulsing of the spheres halted. There was a sharp dip in the faint\r\nvibration he had been feeling in his feet. He shoved the levers all the\r\nway, and suddenly the station went dead. Above him, one of the great\r\ndiscs atop its mast snapped and burst apart under what must have become\r\nan impossible concentration of power without a channel for outlet.\r\n\r\n\"Sun-tap Station Mercury is dead,\" Burl said quietly into his helmet\r\nphone.\r\n\r\nAt that very instant a distant globe, perched on a pedestal against the\r\nwall away from the rest of the equipment, flared a brilliant red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8. _The Veil of Venus_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an artificially constructed chamber somewhere in the solar system, an\r\nintelligent being sat before a bank of instruments that was designed to\r\nbring to his attention various factors concerning the things that\r\nmattered to his species. This being had been on duty for the average\r\nlength of time such a duty entailed and had been paying little conscious\r\nattention to the routine--for there had been nothing to report for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe drop in channeling from Planet III that had occurred some time ago\r\nhad thus far not caused too much concern. It was assumed by the other\r\nintelligent beings involved that the matter was possibly a weather\r\ncondition, a volcanic discharge or quite simply that the planet was in\r\nunfavorable orbit. Not all the stations ever worked simultaneously.\r\nThere were always some behind the Sun, or blocked in some other manner.\r\nBut the main channels were at work, and the different lines and shifts\r\ncontinued to build up satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nBut now something occurred that focused the attention of the watcher\r\nmore closely on his instruments. A facet of his panel had flashed a\r\ncolor at the lowest end of his visible spectrum. How the being\r\nregistered that color cannot be said; the inhabitants of Planet III\r\nwould have termed it red.\r\n\r\nWith trained reaction, the watcher activated the full signal. Instantly\r\nthere appeared before his eyes a vision of a scene. There was the\r\ninterior of the major station on Planet I. It was non-functioning, and\r\nthere were two strange creatures turning now to look directly at him.\r\nThey were bipeds with two armlike extensions, lumpy objects, clad in\r\nbulky white folds. They wore cumbersome helmets and he could see two\r\neyes shielded beneath thick transparencies over the face.\r\n\r\nOne of these creatures raised his arm and there was a puff of steam.\r\nThen the vision flashed off, but not before the trained watcher had\r\nactivated the crash mechanism.\r\n\r\nIf the watcher had been closer in space to the station, the destruction\r\nwould have come quicker. Unfortunately for him, the speed of light and\r\nradio impulses is limited, so that it was several minutes before the\r\ndestruction impulse reached Planet I.\r\n\r\nA short while later, after the guiding beings had digested the news,\r\npreparations were made for a vessel to go sunward to investigate--and\r\nremove--the interference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurl twisted on his heel sharply as he whirled around to look at the\r\nflash of red. Boulton drew his hand weapon, aimed and fired.\r\n\r\nThere was a jet of steam as the compressed air blasted the dart from the\r\ngun. The glowing globe was pierced, there was a small explosion, and\r\nthen the globe and its pedestal vanished.\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" cried Burl.\r\n\r\nBoulton holstered his gun. \"A signal of some kind--a warning probably.\r\nMy guess is that it was an alarm tipping off the remote control masters\r\nof this place that it was out of commission. Help me with the photo\r\nstuff; I think we'd better get out of here quick!\"\r\n\r\nWithout wasting more time, the two men snapped the scene as fast as the\r\nshutters would click. Then they picked up the cameras, grabbed their\r\numbrellas and ran for the break in the wall.\r\n\r\nJust as they made their first flying leaps toward the shielded rocket\r\nplane, the globes within the Sun-tap station started to go off. One\r\nafter another, like a chain reaction, they blew up, and within seconds\r\nthe interior of the walled station was a turmoil of falling metals,\r\nbeams, wires, and sharp transparent shards.\r\n\r\nHaines and Ferrati were ready for take-off and puffs of smoke were\r\ncoming from the exhaust. Without bothering to take down the plastic\r\nSun-shield, Burl and Boulton tumbled into the cabin. Before the door\r\nwas even closed, Haines lifted the ship and headed for the dark depths\r\nof the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the plane was perilously hot. The shield had been a\r\ntemporary protection, but even the ground radiated heat like an oven.\r\nThey had to seek the cold of the sunless canyon to allow some of the\r\nheat to escape. To have flown directly to the _Magellan_ without cooling\r\nthe plane would have been disastrous.\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ emerged from the cold side to meet them. From the heights\r\nof space, they saw that they would not need to bomb the mountain relayer\r\nmasts--for the same alarm that had triggered the station had shattered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter the _Magellan_ had scuttled back to the cold side, there was a\r\ncouncil of war in the control room. Burl and Boulton described very\r\ncarefully what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"This must have been their primary station,\" said Russ thoughtfully. \"No\r\nmatter what they seek to channel from the Sun on other planets, it is\r\nfrom here that the first and strongest diversion of solar energy must\r\nhave been coming. This station may have been the last constructed--the\r\nfinal link put into place. And for that reason, they installed an\r\nalarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Lockhart, \"even if they did, would it necessarily have\r\ndestroyed the station? After all, they would normally have figured on\r\nrepairing whatever went wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Burl, \"that the red flash itself didn't start the\r\ndestruction. There was a delay--must have been several minutes--before\r\nit started. Could it be, that what was alerted was a watcher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" said Boulton. \"There was no place for a watcher to be in that\r\nstation. We saw no sign of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe deep underground?\" suggested the engineer, Caton. \"They might\r\nhave living quarters a few miles underneath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Highly unlikely,\" said Russ Clyde. \"It would still be too hot, and,\r\nremember, these people plan to incinerate Mercury and the inner planets.\r\nThey must be from the edge of the system. The delay may be a valuable\r\nclue to that. It would take time for a remote control station on another\r\nplanet to see what was happening and take steps. If you can figure out\r\nexactly how many minutes and seconds elapsed between the flashing of the\r\nred bulb and the blowup, we could work out the approximate distance.\"\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the time could not be judged that accurately.\r\nNeither Burl nor Boulton had had time to look at his watch.\r\n\r\nThey hung over the cold side of Mercury for several hours more while the\r\ntwo astronomers figured their next move. When the orbits had been\r\ndetermined, the _Magellan_ turned its massive wide nose away from the\r\nSun toward a gleaming white disc that dominated the dark skies of outer\r\nspace. With full power on, they pushed away from the littlest planet\r\nand began the long fall toward the Sun's second planet, that which some\r\nhad considered to be Earth's veiled twin, Venus.\r\n\r\nThere was a matter of thirty million miles to cross, and the crossing\r\nwould be made fighting the pull of the Sun all the way.\r\n\r\nCaton and his men had spent the wait on Mercury working on the great\r\ngenerators in the powerhouse nose. They recalibrated the output and\r\ncorrected it from the records kept during the flight inward. Now they\r\nwere confident of its ability to drive the ship away from the Sun.\r\nComing in, they had not been sure what their A-G drive would do and\r\ncould do. Going outward they knew just what to expect.\r\n\r\nThey did not travel blindly outward, for that would have been both a\r\ncrude waste of power and inaccurate. Instead, the ship drove at a long\r\nslant from the Sun, moving in a gently curving orbit that would bring it\r\nonto Venus at the same time that Venus itself was moving along in its\r\norbit. This is what they had tried to do before, but without success.\r\nVenus travels around the Sun at a speed of about 32 miles per second,\r\nand takes about 224.5 days to complete the circuit. From where the\r\n_Magellan_ took off, it would approach and overtake Venus at a speed a\r\nlittle greater than the 32 miles per second.\r\n\r\nThe days passed swiftly enough. They had developed the pictures taken in\r\nthe Mercury station, and the engineers and astronomers spent long hours\r\ndebating their features, matching up what they had seen with what was\r\nknown about the Andes station.\r\n\r\nThe shining face of Venus grew larger. It was a mysterious planet, the\r\nmost mysterious in the system, even though it was the closest of the\r\nplanets to Earth. Venus was a world whose atmosphere--of Earthly\r\ndepth--was a solid mass of clouds. Never had the clouds lifted to reveal\r\nthe surface. The clouds reflected the sunlight brilliantly, yet as Burl\r\ncould now see with the naked eye, parts of it were hazy, as if mighty\r\nstorms were raising dark particles from below.\r\n\r\n\"We've had a couple of prober rockets shot into its surface,\" said Russ,\r\nas they watched the oncoming planet. \"They didn't prove much--faded out\r\nfast, but we think they established its length of day. Nobody knew how\r\nmany hours it took Venus to rotate on its axis. Some even thought it\r\nalways presented one face to the Sun as does Mercury. Others thought it\r\nhad a quick day, shorter than Earth's. Others gave it a day almost a\r\nmonth long.\r\n\r\n\"Our prober rockets, carrying unmanned instruments, rather definitely\r\nindicate that the planet has a day about twenty Earth-days long. Even\r\nthough it's shielded by the clouds, it must be miserably hot near the\r\nsurface.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon find out.\" Burl grinned. \"After Mercury, it couldn't be so\r\nbad. Maybe it rains all the time.\"\r\n\r\nRuss shrugged. \"Who knows?\" he said.\r\n\r\nVenus was a vast sea of swirling white and gray clouds beneath them when\r\nthe _Magellan_ reached it. They hung above the cloud level, while\r\nstretching below them lay the circular bowl of veiled mystery that was\r\nthe fabled evening star of poem and song.\r\n\r\nOberfield was probing the surface with the radiation counters for the\r\nSun-tap distortion. None had been detected from Earth, but observation\r\nof the sunny face of Venus had always been difficult from the third\r\nplanetary orbit. But quickly the dour astronomer proved the fact. A\r\ncalculation of the planet's albedo--its rate of reflected\r\nsunlight--showed that in one large central section there was a dimming\r\nout. Somewhere in that spot, the light was being diverted.\r\n\r\nLockhart brought the _Magellan_ down gradually, closer, closer, and\r\nfinally sank it into the soupy atmosphere of Venus. Now, from every\r\nviewplate, nothing reflected but a glare of white mist. But the ship was\r\nnot operating blind. Radar pierced the clouds, and from the wide screens\r\nthe crew could see that they had not yet touched the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Watch out for mountains,\" whispered Russ, hanging over Lockhart's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nTheir progress was slow but steady. The cloud bank around them did not\r\nclear, but still glowed gray. After a descent of nearly two hours, there\r\nwas a flicker on the radar. It registered no features, no mountains,\r\nnothing but a seemingly flat plain.\r\n\r\nAbove and around them the white clouds still blanketed everything. But\r\nnow Burl thought he saw a pale glow. Gradually the white faded away into\r\nwisps and shreds, and in a flash the ship broke out of the clouds.\r\n\r\nThey hung beneath a grayish-white sky. Below them, scarcely a half mile\r\nof visibility in misty, thin air, they saw the surface of Venus. They\r\nwere over water. An ocean stretched below them as far as the eye could\r\nsee, with neither a rock nor an island. Venus was a water world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9. _The Ocean Primeval_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ hung in the air while the men studied the surface of this\r\nworld that had so long been a mystery. The air was not the clear air of\r\nEarth; rather, it was the kind that precedes the coming of a fog, thick,\r\nheavy with moisture, the horizons fading into gray. Below them lay a\r\nmottled expanse of water, reflecting the gray sky, and verging almost to\r\na deep brown. The water was still, occasionally stirred by a slight\r\nwave. \"No tides have ever moved these waters,\" commented Russ quietly to\r\nBurl. \"There is no moon to pull and sway them. The motion of this world,\r\nso slow in the passage of its day, hardly disturbs the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks shallow to me,\" said Burl. \"The darker sections look as if the\r\nbottom must be close.\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine it is. We'll take soundings,\" Russ answered. \"I have a\r\nfeeling the whole world may be like this ... one vast, shallow, swampy\r\nsea. See the scum floating on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"See it? Now that you mention it, there's hardly a part that hasn't\r\nsomething on it,\" was Burl's reply. \"There're patches of muck all over\r\nit, like floating oil, or even drifting masses of weeds.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true. The water showed on its surface a strange filth unlike\r\nanything one would expect on the surface of a Terrestrial sea. There\r\nwere wide areas of brownish-gray slime and little floating blobs of\r\ngreen. Shining flecks of yellow, like bright oil drops, seemed to flow\r\nthrough and between the masses of scum.\r\n\r\nAt the radar, Haines began to call out figures. As Russ had guessed, it\r\nwas a shallow sea. In places, the bottom was only a dozen feet beneath.\r\nFor a while, all the men of the crew were quiet, watching the silent\r\nwaters beneath them.\r\n\r\n\"Unclean, the whole place looks unclean,\" Lockhart said finally. \"We've\r\ngot work to do. Let's find the Sun-tap station.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the crew came to action. The spaceship began to move slowly,\r\nwhile Oberfield and Caton probed for the lines of force which would lead\r\nto the station.\r\n\r\nNow a long, low bank appeared, a ridge of mud protruding above the\r\nwater. Here and there stretched other low mud bars, and once a ridge of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen no animals or birds,\" said Burl. \"Do you suppose there are\r\nany?\"\r\n\r\nRuss pursed his lips. \"I don't think so. From the look of this world,\r\nlife probably isn't developed that far. You won't find animals until\r\nthere is dry land--and I'd guess now that there's no place on all Venus\r\nwhere there is much dry land. There may be fish or fish life, but even\r\nthat's questionable. Consider--the long, long day, the absence of\r\nviolent, unshielded Sun rays, the steady damp warmth, the quiet, barely\r\nmoving waters, the heavy amounts of carbon dioxide in the air....\"\r\n\r\nHe paused and went over to Lockhart's chart table to pick up a paper.\r\n\"Oberfield worked out the atmosphere. It is very heavy in carbon\r\ndioxide, very low in free oxygen. There's water vapor down here, but the\r\nclouds have kept it below; it didn't show up in the outer atmosphere at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the Sun-tap base,\" said Burl, and added as an afterthought, \"I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nThis one did not look at all like the other stations he had seen. There\r\nwas indeed a ringed wall station, but the wall was low and slanted\r\noutward. It stood on the end of a wide mudbank, and near it veins of\r\nrock glistened as if wet.\r\n\r\nThe interior machinery was a neat, compact mass of crystalline globes\r\nand levers. But the masts and shining discs which had characterized the\r\nstations on Mercury and Earth were missing. Instead, there floated upon\r\nthe surface of the water, for a mile around, great shining bowls, like\r\nhuge saucers gently rocking in the faint wavelets. Thin, flexible,\r\nshining lines of metal connected this surface layout with the station.\r\n\r\n\"With no direct Sun to aim at, this station seems to be directed toward\r\na nonfocused system of light diversion,\" Lockhart announced. \"The\r\nwrecking crew please get under way!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going down with you,\" Russ joined in. \"I've gotten permission to\r\ntake some observations from the surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Burl, and hurried with him down to the central floor.\r\n\r\nThey disembarked in two parties. Haines and Ferrati used the two-man\r\nrocket plane and would make a wide encirclement of the vicinity, mapping\r\nand finally blowing up the accumulator discs floating on the surface.\r\nBurl, Russ, and Boulton took a helicopter.\r\n\r\nThe helicopter, under the control of the Marine captain, dropped out of\r\nthe cargo port of the _Magellan_. Steadied by the regular whirl of its\r\ngreat blades and driven by tiny rocket jets in the tip of each wing, the\r\nwhirlybird swung down like a huge mosquito hovering over a swamp patch.\r\n\r\nIt moved over the water and finally hung directly over the mudbank.\r\nManeuvering so that the helicopter was directly in the protected circle\r\nof the walls, Burl and Russ dropped a rope ladder and swung down hand\r\nover hand to be the first human beings to set foot on Venus.\r\n\r\nThey were lightly dressed, for the temperature was hot, around 110°, and\r\nit was humid. No breezes blew here. They wore shorts and shirts and\r\nhigh-laced leather boots. Each carried two small tanks of oxygen on his\r\nback. A leather mouth nozzle strapped across the shoulders guaranteed a\r\nsteady flow of breathable air. In their belts were strapped knives and\r\narmy pistols. Russ carried recording equipment, and Burl a hatchet.\r\n\r\nThey dropped off the swaying ladder inside the station. The ground was\r\nhard-packed as if the builders had beaten it down and smoothed it off.\r\nThe globes were familiar to Burl--he had studied the pictures of the two\r\nhe had already visited and he realized that they followed the same\r\ngeneral system. Where the mast towers would have been, there were leads\r\nrunning through the plastic walls out across the sea. He wondered\r\nbriefly why the walls were curved outward.\r\n\r\nAs the helicopter moved away, the metal weight on the end of the\r\ndangling ladder brushed the top of the wall. There was a crackling\r\nnoise, and a spark jumped between them.\r\n\r\n\"The wall is electrically charged,\" said Burl. \"I wonder why?\"\r\n\r\nRuss shook his head. \"From the looks of it, to keep off something.\r\nPerhaps some kind of native life. But what? I'm sure there's nothing of\r\na highly organized physical structure here.\"\r\n\r\nBurl found the controls of the station, but before touching them, he\r\nremembered the alarm on Mercury. \"I'd better try to smash the alarm\r\nfirst,\" he called out to Russ.\r\n\r\nFinally, Burl located an isolated globe perched on a post, which\r\nresembled the one he had briefly glimpsed on Mercury. He ran his hands\r\nover it, feeling a mild vibration within. Then, at its base, he found\r\nthe levers. He moved them and the vibration died out. \"I think I've\r\nturned it off,\" he announced. \"But stand by with a gun, just in case.\"\r\n\r\nRuss drew his pistol, and Burl switched off the main controls of the\r\nSun-tap. A globe or two burst; there was a sort of settling down in the\r\nstation. Abruptly they felt the heat intensify and knew that the sky was\r\nshining more brilliantly than before. The diversion of the Sun was over\r\nfor Venus.\r\n\r\nThe alarm globe remained quiet, but Burl took his hatchet and smashed\r\nit. Russ was carefully photographing the station, measuring the\r\ndistances, and tracing the lines. Overhead, the wide blades of the\r\nhelicopter flapped around and around, accompanied by little hissing\r\npuffs of rocket smoke. They could see Boulton looking down at them from\r\nthe tiny cabin.\r\n\r\nRuss was scooping up bits of soil to bring back for analysis when he saw\r\nwhat seemed to be a wet patch on top of the wall. As he watched, it\r\nspread until it reached the bottom. In a remarkably short time a whole\r\nsection of wall was gleaming wet. A patch of damp oiliness spread over\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\"This I've got to get a sample of,\" said the rusty-haired astronomer. He\r\nreached for a sampling bottle in his pocket, and at the same time the\r\npatch of wetness spread to his shoes.\r\n\r\nAs Russ stepped forward, there was a sucking sound, and he lifted a\r\nthick gummy mass that was stuck to his sole. He shook his foot, set it\r\ndown, and lifted the other, but it, too, was imbedded in thick slime.\r\nThe stuff now was running up his ankle.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" he called out, and swung one foot vigorously to free it. More\r\nswiftly than he could move, the whole patch slid down the wall and swept\r\naround him. It was moving up his legs, as if trying to envelop him.\r\n\r\n\"It's alive!\" he shouted, and grabbed for the knife in his belt. In vain\r\nhe tried to slash out. \"It's like a giant amoeba that engulfs its food!\r\nGet it off me!\"\r\n\r\nBut the knife was ineffective. He fired his pistol, but the thing was\r\njust a vast wide puddle of slime, without brain, heart or organ that\r\ncould be harmed. The soles of Russ's boots were already half eaten away\r\nand his socks were going fast. Some of it was touching the skin of his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nHe screamed as the stuff burned him.\r\n\r\nBurl had joined the attack with his knife, but leaped back when that\r\nproved useless. His mind raced for a way to help. Above them, Boulton\r\nwas swinging the helicopter down so Russ could hoist himself out of\r\nharm's way, but time would not permit it. In another instant the mass\r\nwould have Russ.\r\n\r\nBurl grabbed at the straps crossing his shoulder and swung the two\r\noxygen tanks from his back. He snatched one from its leather holster,\r\nand pointed its nozzle at the mass of slime. He turned the stream of\r\noxygen on, and then, taking his pistol, held its muzzle in the jet of\r\noxygen and fired it.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the gun was matched by the roar of a stream of fire that\r\nshot from the tank. Wherever the burning jet of oxygen touched, the mass\r\nshriveled and blackened. Yards and yards of amoeba seemed to writhe,\r\nhump upward in agony, and pull away.\r\n\r\nThere was a ring of burned white along the ground, a sickening smell in\r\nthe air, but the thing was dead.\r\n\r\nRussell Clyde grabbed the ladder as it swung toward him, and climbed up.\r\nThe soles of his boots were gone and the sides were strings of raw,\r\nhalf-eaten leather. His legs and knees bore ugly patches of red where\r\nthe slime had touched.\r\n\r\n\"Well done!\" called Boulton to Burl from the cabin. \"Come on up before\r\nsomething else comes along!\"\r\n\r\nBurl grabbed the ladder. He took two steps on the swaying, swinging rope\r\nas the helicopter started to climb and suddenly he felt himself losing\r\nstrength. He became dizzy and tried to hold on, but began to lose\r\nconsciousness. Dimly he heard Boulton yell at him, \"The oxygen, the\r\nother tank, turn it on!\"\r\n\r\nThe second tank was still dangling from his chest.\r\n\r\nFighting for consciousness, Burl twisted the nozzle. There was a hiss\r\nand he felt air blow against him. Miraculously, his senses cleared, and\r\nholding the oxygen tank tight against him, he climbed up the ladder and\r\ninto the safety of the helicopter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10. _The Dying Planet_\r\n\r\n\r\nRussell Clyde was confined to his bunk during the next four days, his\r\nfeet wrapped in bandages and ointment. Fortunately the digestive juices\r\nof the Venusian amoeba had only just begun their attack upon the skin\r\nafter eating through the footgear. Except for some painful blisters and\r\nrawness, his condition was not serious.\r\n\r\nThe little stateroom was cramped, containing as it did two bunks, one\r\nabove the other, like the cabin of a liner. What with a couple of\r\nbuilt-in lockers for clothes, and a bolted-down chair and a reading\r\nlamp, it was not a place to spend any more time than necessary. The lack\r\nof a window added to the inhospitality of the room. But Burl had\r\naccepted long ago the fact that a spaceship could not yet be considered\r\na luxury liner. In time, the A-G drive would permit such things, but the\r\n_Magellan_ was an experimental vessel turned by emergency into a\r\nwarship.\r\n\r\nDuring those four days, Burl spent most of his time with Russ, getting\r\nto know him better, and talking about the trip. The young astronomer was\r\nnot at all chagrined by his misadventure. In fact, the whole experience\r\nhad him quite buoyed up.\r\n\r\n\"What a wonderful place for biologists to study! Venus will be a Mecca\r\nfor scientific learning!\"\r\n\r\n\"But not for anything else, I don't think,\" said Burl. \"Anyway, we're in\r\nfor another experience now. Mars is our next goal. What's it like?\"\r\n\r\nRuss put his hands behind his head and looked up at the bottom of the\r\nbunk above him. \"We can see Mars well enough; there's no cloud blanket\r\nand the atmosphere is thin but clear. You've seen the photos and the\r\ncolored sketches?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen it from our viewplates, but so far it's just a tiny, red\r\ndisc. We're about at Earth's orbit now, even though Earth is many\r\nmillions of miles away from us. Mars is still about fifty million miles\r\nfurther, but we're gaining speed quite rapidly and Lockhart thinks we'll\r\nmake it soon enough.\" Burl picked up one of the books from the ship's\r\nlibrary and started to thumb through it to locate a color chart of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nRuss waved a hand. \"You don't have to show me. I've studied Mars by\r\ntelescope so often I know it by heart. It's mostly a sort of light,\r\nreddish-tan, a kind of pale russet. We think that's desert. There are\r\nsome fairly large sections that are bluish-green--at least in the\r\nMartian summers. In their winters these sections fade very greatly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's vegetation,\" Burl broke in. \"It must be! Everybody agrees it\r\nacts like it. And there are the white polar caps, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell which season is which by the size of the polar ice caps.\r\nWhen one is big, the other is almost gone. Then there's the problem of\r\nthe canals....\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in them?\" asked Burl. \"The books disagree. Some think\r\nthey're real--even say they look as if they had been built by\r\nintelligent beings as irrigation channels to take the melting waters of\r\nthe poles down to the fertile lands. But other astronomers claim they\r\ncan't see them--or that they're illusions, series of cracks, or lines of\r\ndark dust blown by winds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I've come to believe in them,\" Russ argued. \"They've been\r\nphotographed--something is there. They're very faint, spidery lines, but\r\nthey certainly are straight and regular. We'll find out soon enough.\"\r\n\r\nFind out they did. Russ was up and about and the normal life of the ship\r\nresumed. During their passage of Earth's orbit, they had managed to\r\nraise the United States on the ship's radio. For three days they were\r\nable to converse with their home base. They exchanged news and data,\r\ntransmitted back all they had learned and eagerly asked for news.\r\n\r\nThe men of the crew had the chance to send messages home, and Burl even\r\ntalked briefly with his father. There had been an important discovery\r\nmade on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe lines of force had finally been traced. The distortions visible on\r\nMars, as well as the one from Mercury before its cutoff, had been worked\r\nout directionally. There was no doubt that a line of force had been\r\nchanneled outward to a point in space that now proved to be that of a\r\nplanet. The planet was Pluto.\r\n\r\n\"Pluto!\" That was the shocked word uttered by everyone within hearing\r\ndistance when the radio voice said it.\r\n\r\n\"Pluto! Why, that's the end of the line! The most distant planet,\" said\r\nOberfield, shocked. \"We'll have to go there--all the way!\"\r\n\r\nThat fact sobered everyone. It meant the trip must last many times\r\nlonger than anyone had expected. But they were a band of men who had\r\nachieved great things--they had managed so far to work together in\r\nharmony, and they felt that since they had conquered two planets--what\r\nwere a few more?\r\n\r\nMars gradually grew larger on their telescopic viewers as the _Magellan_\r\nfell onward through space, riding the beam of gravity that was like a\r\npulling rope to them. The slow down and reverse was made in good\r\norder--the sphere swinging around, readjusting, and the great, driving\r\nZeta-ring generators now pushing and braking.\r\n\r\nThen one wake period, Russ and Burl went to the telescope and trained it\r\nagain on the oncoming planet. The now large disc of the ruddy world\r\nswung onto the screen. It looked strange, not at all like the drawings.\r\n\r\nBurl had never seen it through Terrestrial telescopes, but he sensed\r\nsomething was wrong. He realized suddenly, \"Both poles are enlarged!\r\nIt's winter on _both_ hemispheres! And that's impossible!\"\r\n\r\nYet it was so. Both the Martian ice caps were present and both extended\r\ndown the northern and southern hemispheres of the world. The men stared\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\nSlowly Russ tried to figure it out, \"The greenish-blue areas can\r\nscarcely be seen. Where they should be, there're darker patches of\r\nbrown, against the yellowish-red that now seems to be the desert areas.\r\nIt seems to be winter on both sides and it looks bad. It looks to me as\r\nif Mars were a fast-dying world.\"\r\n\r\nBurl squinted his eyes. \"Yet I see the canals. The straight lines are\r\nstill visible--see?\"\r\n\r\nRuss nodded. \"They're real. But what's happened?\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the planet seemed blighted. \"It's the Sun-tap,\" Burl decided.\r\n\"We should have realized what it would do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember Earth the week it was working? The temperature fell several\r\ndegrees, began to damage crops? Remember how it snowed in places where\r\nsnow had never fallen in July? Remember the predictions of disaster for\r\ncrops, of danger from winter snows if the drop continued?\"\r\n\r\nRuss went on in his careful, explanatory way. \"And for Mars it has\r\ncontinued. Mars was always colder than Earth; life there must have been\r\nfar more precariously balanced. During the day, on the Martian equator\r\nin midsummer, the highest temperature is not likely to be more than 70°\r\nor 80°; and at night, even then, it would fall below freezing.\r\nVegetation on Mars must have been hardy in the best of times, and life\r\ncarried on under great difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"Now the margin of warmth and light has been cut. It has been just\r\nenough to keep both polar caps frozen, to prevent water from reaching\r\nthe fertile regions, and the cold has advanced enough to bar the growth\r\nand regeneration of plant life. If the Sun-tapping on Mars is not\r\nstopped, all life there will die out, and it will be a permanently dead\r\nworld forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe news spread throughout the crew and there was a feeling of anger and\r\nurgency. Nobody knew what lived on Mars, yet the subject of Mars and\r\nMartians had always intrigued the imaginations of people on Earth. Now,\r\nto hear that the unknown enemy had nearly slain a neighboring world\r\nbrought home vividly just what would also have been the fate of Earth.\r\n\r\nThe day finally came when the big spaceship slid into an orbit about the\r\nruddy planet. It circled just outside the atmospheric level while the\r\nmen aboard studied the surface for its secrets.\r\n\r\nMars was indeed inhabited. This fact was borne home by the canals and\r\nthe very evident artificial nature of their construction. They could see\r\nclearly through their telescopes that there was an intricate global\r\nnetwork of pipelines, pumping stations, and irrigation viaducts from\r\npole to pole. They also saw that at the intersections of the canals were\r\ndark sections crisscrossed with thin blobs of gray and black which\r\nproved under the telescopes to be clusters of buildings. There were\r\ncities on Mars, linked by the waterways.\r\n\r\nThey saw no aircraft. They detected no railroad lines or roadways beyond\r\nthe canalways themselves. The many regions of darker, better ground,\r\nintersected by the canals which no longer fulfilled their purposes, were\r\ncovered with thick vegetation--forests of dying, wintery stalks. Only a\r\nflicker of dark green here and there showed where some faint irrigation\r\nstill got through.\r\n\r\nThey saw also that there were lines of white, which had not been visible\r\nbefore. Snow was gathering in low spots, and the planet was freezing up.\r\n\r\nThe lines of solar distortion were strong, and they traced them to their\r\npoint of concentration. The point was not some isolated spot far in a\r\ndesert, away from Martian investigation. To the amazement of the men,\r\nthe location of the Sun-tap station was actually within a Martian city!\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose,\" Lockhart queried the others, \"that the Martians\r\nthemselves are the builders of this setup--that this is their\r\nproject--that they are the criminals and not the victims?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. The evidence was apparent, but it made no sense. If\r\nthe Martians had created this thing, it was destroying them. And yet, if\r\nthey had not created it, why did they--so clearly a race that had\r\nattained a high level of engineering ability--tolerate its continual\r\nexistence?\r\n\r\nAs the ship descended, they saw the city emerge. It consisted of\r\nhundreds of gray mounds--buildings laid out in the form of neat\r\nhemispherical structures, like skyscraper igloos, with rows of circular\r\nwindows. Each building was like the next, and they fitted together in a\r\nseries of great circles, radiating outward from the meeting spot of the\r\ncanals.\r\n\r\nThe explorer crew waited at the ship's rocket launchers for an attack.\r\nThe tail of the teardrop housed the built-in armament--the rocket tubes\r\nwhich could send forth destruction to an enemy. But though Haines sat\r\nwith his finger on the launcher button, no aircraft rose to meet them\r\nfrom the city below. No guns barked at them. No panic started in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThey could see tiny dots of living beings moving about, but no sign of\r\nalarm, no evidence that they had been noticed.\r\n\r\nEven here, at the equator, there were streaks of white snow in the\r\nstreets and rings of rime along the bases of the buildings.\r\n\r\nDirectly below them lay the Sun-tap station. The lines converged here,\r\nand the rings of distortion could be seen in the atmosphere, causing the\r\ncity to flicker as if from the presence of invisible waves.\r\n\r\nThen they saw the masts and their shining accumulators projecting about\r\na cleared spot near the outskirts of the city. The customary walled\r\nring and the open machinery were not visible.\r\n\r\n\"The Sun-tap station is under the city!\" said Lockhart, shocked. \"It's\r\nbeen built beneath the streets somewhere, and the Martians walk around\r\nabove it and let the masts alone! They must be the builders!\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, why are they killing themselves?\" Burl couldn't see the sense of\r\nit. \"And if they have reasons, then why don't they defend it? They were\r\nalerted while we were on Mercury. They must have spaceships if they are\r\nthe enemy. Where are they?\"\r\n\r\nThe ground was now but a few hundred feet below them, and still no one\r\npaid the strange ship hanging in the sky any attention. While the crew\r\nstood with bated breath, Lockhart brought the ship down and down, until\r\nit came to rest barely fifty feet above an intersection. There it hung,\r\nnearly touching the roofs, and was ignored.\r\n\r\nThe shining masts of the Sun-tap station continued to gleam, following\r\nthe tiny bright Sun in its course through the dark blue of the sky. One\r\nof the two small Martian moons was climbing upward along the horizon.\r\nThe canals beyond were dark lines of conduit, through which no\r\nlife-giving waters flowed. And the Martians did nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11. _Martians Don't Care_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the looks of this at all,\" said Lockhart finally. \"I\r\nsuspect a trap. Yet we've got to land and get at that base. I'm going to\r\ntake the ship out into the desert beyond the city and let a scouting\r\nsquad go in first.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ lifted back into the sky, then moved out over the ocher\r\nwasteland that was the barren desert of the red planet. Slowly the ship\r\ndropped again until its pointed nether end hung about twenty feet above\r\nthe cold shale and time-worn sand.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boulton and Ferrati were selected to do the initial survey. Burl\r\nand Haines helped them climb through the packed spaces of the outer\r\nhold. The jeep was swung out to the lowermost cargo port, and the\r\nspaceship's cargo derrick lowered the compact army vehicle to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe two scouts then put on altitude suits with oxygen masks, slung\r\nwalkie-talkies about their chests, took light carbines in hand and\r\npistols in belts and went down the rope ladder from the cargo port. They\r\nclimbed into the sturdy jeep with its specially-designed carburetor and\r\npressurized engine. The vehicle had been prepared to operate in the\r\nlight atmosphere of Mars, as thin as the air on a Himalayan mountaintop,\r\nand low in free oxygen.\r\n\r\nBurl and Haines, clad in pressure suits themselves, sat in the open port\r\nand watched the jeep set off. The engine kicked over and barked a few\r\ntimes in the strange air. Then Boulton at the wheel threw in the clutch,\r\nstepped on the gas, and the squat little car, painted in Air Force blue,\r\nrolled off over the flat rocky surface, kicking up a light cloud of sand\r\nas it went.\r\n\r\nOn Haines's lap sat a walkie-talkie. Boulton and Ferrati kept up a\r\nrunning commentary as they approached the city. Ferrati described the\r\nground and the appearance of the oncoming city.\r\n\r\nThe jeep was now a small object merging with the dark mounds of the\r\ncity's outermost buildings. \"We haven't met any Martians yet,\" came\r\nFerrari's voice. \"Apparently they aren't interested in investigating us\r\neven now. And here we are rolling right up to the city limits.\" There\r\nwas a pause.\r\n\r\nThe walkie-talkie emitted a series of squeaks and squawks, and Ferrati's\r\nvoice came through now with distortion. \"We're crossing the city\r\nlimits--there's a sort of hard, plastic pavement that begins at the very\r\nedge. Now we're going down an intersection between the buildings.\"\r\n\r\nThe squawks became increasingly louder. They could hear only a word or\r\ntwo. Haines asked whether he was getting through to them, but he could\r\nnot make out an answer because of the racket.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Sun-tap station. It's generating distortion. We'll have to\r\nwait until they return,\" said Burl.\r\n\r\nHaines nodded and turned off the set which had begun to utter\r\near-piercing howls. The two men waited quietly for about half an hour.\r\nOnly a phone call from the curious men in the control room interrupted\r\ntheir vigil.\r\n\r\nThen finally Burl spotted a little cloud of dust on the horizon. \"There\r\nthey are!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men stood up as the little jeep made its way back over the\r\ndesert to the ship. As it drew closer, they saw a third occupant sitting\r\nin the back with Ferrati. Haines opened the walkie-talkie. \"Wait till\r\nyou see this fellow,\" Ferrati's comment came through.\r\n\r\nThe jeep drew up to the ship and stopped. Ferrati waved them down. A few\r\nseconds later they were joined by Lockhart and Clyde, also in pressure\r\nsuits.\r\n\r\nThe creature in the back of the jeep was a Martian. They stared in\r\nfascination. It was about three feet long with a small, oval-shaped head\r\nand two very large, many-faceted eyes. A small, beaklike mouth and\r\nshort, stubby antennae completed its face. The head was attached by a\r\nshort neck to a body that consisted of three oval masses joined together\r\nby narrow belts, much like the joints of an insect. A pair of arms,\r\nending in long three-fingered hands, grew from the first segment. A set\r\nof long, thin legs grew out of each of the two other segments. A\r\nglistening grayish-blue shell, its skin, covered it from head to foot.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, this particular Martian was tightly restrained by a\r\nstrong nylon net, and was obviously the captive of the two explorers.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it looks like a giant insect!\" exclaimed Burl.\r\n\r\n\"More like a kind of lobster,\" was Ferrati's answer. \"But this is it.\r\nThis is one of the city dwellers.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart shook his head. \"I don't like this. We shouldn't do anything to\r\nantagonize the Martians. Taking one prisoner like this may be a bad\r\nfirst move.\"\r\n\r\nBoulton stepped out of the jeep. \"There wasn't anything else we could\r\ndo. Besides, who said that Martians were ever our friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"We got into the city,\" he went on, \"and drove around the streets. There\r\nwere plenty of these fellows around, going about their business.\r\nHundreds of 'em. Do you think they stopped to look at us? Do you think\r\nthey were curious? Do you think they talked to us? Called the police?\r\nDid anything at all?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered himself. \"They just walked around us as if we were a\r\nstick of something in the way. They don't say anything to each other.\r\nThey just go on about their affairs, dragging things, carrying food,\r\nherding young ones, and not a darn word.\r\n\r\n\"They looked at us, and didn't even act as if they saw us. When we\r\nstopped one, it squirmed out of our grasp and walked away. Finally we\r\ntook this fellow, simply grabbed him off the street, tied him up,\r\nstuffed him in the jeep and kidnaped him. And do you think anybody cared\r\nor turned in an alarm or tried to help him? No!\"\r\n\r\nLockhart looked at the prisoner a moment. The Martian stared at him out\r\nof his unwinking multiple eyes. \"Are you sure these are the engineers of\r\nthe canals, the builders?\"\r\n\r\nBoulton nodded. \"Definitely. We saw some of them at work. They were\r\nrepairing a house and they used tools and fire. They have machines, and\r\nthey use them. They've got their city working and well laid out, but I\r\ndon't know how they do it. They must communicate in some way, but they\r\nact as if they had been drilled in their jobs and were going through an\r\nelaborate and complicated pantomime. Even the young don't utter a peep.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart stepped back a bit. \"Untie this fellow. Let's see what he\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Martian had been released from the enveloping net, it made no\r\neffort to communicate. It turned slowly around, a little wobbly at\r\nfirst, and wandered off, paying no attention to the men, the ship, or\r\nthe jeep. Then it started walking at a rapid pace. The men watched as it\r\ntrotted into the desert--away from the city!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to wander around as if lost, and then set out in another\r\ndirection, but still one that would not take it to the city which was\r\nquite plainly in view.\r\n\r\nThe Martian disappeared from view behind a series of small hummocks,\r\nstill bound for nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe men were lost in amazement. Russell Clyde uttered a low whistle.\r\n\"Burl's right. It must be a sort of insect.\"\r\n\r\n\"This whole civilization seems to be insectlike, if you ask me,\" said\r\nBurl. \"It's like a huge anthill, or a big bee-hive. It seems\r\ncomplicated, and the creatures go through complex activities, and all\r\nthe time it's something they were born with.\"\r\n\r\nFerrati nodded. \"Now that you mention it, that's exactly what the city\r\nwas like. Nobody gave orders--everybody just did what they were supposed\r\nto do. Nobody was curious about us because it wasn't their business.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, individually, they haven't intelligence,\" Clyde added. \"That\r\none--the one you took away from his work--plainly is lost. He doesn't\r\nknow how to go about getting back. He has no curiosity about us ... he\r\nmay not even have much of a brain. Individual ants have no brain--only a\r\nsort of central nerve center. Collectively, they perform wonders;\r\nindividually, they are quite helpless.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart interrupted the discussion. \"Well, then, let's get on with it.\r\nObviously, the Sun-tap builders placed their station in this city\r\nbecause it was a safe spot, protected by the Martians themselves, and\r\nbecause the Martians would never think to interfere with them. So you\r\nmen can go back, take your stuff, dig out the station and put it out of\r\ncommission. Get going.\"\r\n\r\nHaines and Burl climbed into the jeep with Boulton and Ferrati. Russell\r\nClyde insisted on joining them, and Lockhart gave his consent. Off they\r\nwent, rumbling over the sand toward the city of instinct.\r\n\r\nBurl was excited and curious about the Martians. They presented a\r\nstrange mixture of contradictions. \"How,\" he asked Russ, \"could they\r\nhave built a world-wide network of canals, set up pumping stations, laid\r\nout plantations, mastered hydraulic and power engineering, if they are\r\nmere creatures of instinct? Surely there must be brainy ones somewhere?\r\nA thinker species?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Russ. \"Remember, these creatures are operating\r\nwithout opposition--they are really the highest type of life here. The\r\nneed to conserve water and continue their hive life forced them to learn\r\na practical kind of engineering. Nobody knows how the ants and bees\r\nformed their complex societies--there are none among them with any\r\nlarger brains than the rest, and they do not talk. But somehow ants and\r\nbees communicate and somehow they act as a mass. Figure it on a\r\nworld-wide scale, driven by the threat of their world drying up, and\r\nthese creatures built up a mechanical civilization to meet it. But it\r\nalso accounts for why they have never flown, not through the air and not\r\nthrough space, why they haven't attempted radio communication with\r\nEarth, and why they don't understand what the Sun-tap station is doing\r\nto them. Their world is being killed, and they literally haven't the\r\nbrains to understand it.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the city. All about was a silent hustle and bustle of\r\nenigmatic, shining, shelled creatures. Superficially, it looked like an\r\nintelligent civilization. There were wheeled carts driven by some sort\r\nof steam generator. Steam-driven engines ran factories.\r\n\r\nThe Martians made way for the jeep with unconcern. Never had they seen\r\ncreatures as large as themselves that were not of their own kind on hive\r\nbusiness. Hence, none such could exist. This was a world totally without\r\nindividualism, a civilization without a spoken language, without names,\r\nwithout banners. Wherever or however the mass knowledge was located or\r\ntransmitted, no individual of another species could ever hope to know.\r\nIt would be forever as remote from human explorers as the farthest star\r\non the farthest galaxy.\r\n\r\nThey drove to where the Sun-tap masts rose from the ground. The men\r\nparked the jeep out of the way of the silent traffic, climbed out and\r\nwalked into the rounded door of a building. Its architecture was not\r\nlike that of the other buildings. Inside the chambers were dark.\r\n\r\n\"These creatures have no lights,\" remarked Boulton. \"They must use their\r\nfeelers indoors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but look,\" said Burl, reaching out a hand to a little globe set on\r\na pole in the floor. He touched it and the globe lighted up. \"The\r\nSun-tap builders needed light and put in their own fixtures here. I\r\nrecognize their style.\"\r\n\r\nThe five men followed a hallway that sloped down into the ground, and\r\ncame out into a large underground cellar--several hundred feet wide. It\r\nwas the Sun-tap station. There were the now-familiar globes and rods,\r\nthe force fields, the controls, the pedestals and the ends of the\r\nrotating masts.\r\n\r\nThey made their recordings, and Burl got ready to turn off the station.\r\nFerrati and Haines uncrated a small, tactical atomic bomb they had\r\ncarried with them--one of the smallest perfected by the Army during the\r\npast half dozen years. They laid it down in the center of the equipment\r\nand set the timer for a half hour away.\r\n\r\nBoulton found the alarm globe and prepared to blow it up. Then Burl took\r\nthe control panel and switched off the station. They heard the thud of a\r\ncrumbling mast. Boulton fired a shot into the alarm globe which had\r\nbegun to turn red. It smashed.\r\n\r\n\"All right, men,\" snapped Haines, \"let's go!\"\r\n\r\nAs they moved toward the exit, Boulton hesitated. \"Hey,\" he said,\r\n\"there's one globe still in action!\"\r\n\r\nThe others turned in time to see Boulton stride over to a very small\r\nglobe which was glowing pale yellow against the wall near the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe Marine captain drew his pistol, aimed and fired. The globe burst,\r\nbut as it did so, a level bolt of yellow light shot back along the path\r\nof the bullet. For a split second, Boulton was outlined in yellow fire.\r\nThere was a flash like lightning.\r\n\r\nEach man reached for his weapons, but the underground station remained\r\ndark and dead. Their flashlights turned on Boulton. The stocky Marine\r\nwas lying on the ground.\r\n\r\nThey ran to him. \"He's alive!\" cried Haines, as he saw that Boulton was\r\nstill breathing, his breath whistling back and forth through the oxygen\r\nmask. Quickly Haines examined him. \"His heart's all right. He's just\r\nbeen knocked unconscious.\"\r\n\r\nFerrati and Haines picked up the captain by his arms and legs. Though he\r\nwould have been heavy on Earth, his weight on Mars was very slight, and\r\neach man knew he was capable of carrying great loads with his\r\nEarth-attuned muscles. Then, in single file, they left the cellar and\r\ncame out of the doorway of the building.\r\n\r\nAs they emerged they were stopped short. Surrounding them was a\r\ntremendous and growing crowd of Martians. A solid wall of shell-like\r\nfaces stared at them, and a small forest of short antennae waved and\r\nflickered in great agitation.\r\n\r\nAs they pushed their way with great difficulty toward the jeep, the\r\ncrowd began to sway, as if in anger. Now, for the first time, they heard\r\nthe creatures make a noise--a sort of humming and buzzing like angered\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n\"They see us now,\" muttered Haines. \"I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Sun-tap builders did it,\" said Burl. \"They must have booby-trapped\r\nthe place against intruders. The globe that got Boulton must have set\r\noff some sort of vibration that enrages these creatures. And it looks\r\nas if we're the victims.\"\r\n\r\nAs they reached their jeep, the encircling mass of Martians moved\r\nforward. The humming rose to a higher pitch, and then the mob, with the\r\nberserk ferocity of a swarm of bees, lunged toward them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12. _At Rope's End_\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Boulton lying across the back seat, the four men acted\r\nsimultaneously. Thinking only of self-defense, they drew their pistols\r\nand fired point-blank into the monsters attacking them. As the men\r\nemptied their guns, the Martians in front stumbled, fell, rolled over,\r\nor began to run aimlessly as the heavy slugs tore through them.\r\n\r\nThey were not easy to kill--which was to be expected of creatures\r\nwithout much of a central consciousness--but on the other hand, once\r\nstruck or injured, they seemed to lose contact with their fellows and to\r\nact wholly without direction. They plunged wildly into each other, and\r\nbefore the men in the jeep had finished their barrage, the clearing was\r\na milling, confused mob. Body clashed against body, legs scrambled\r\nunder legs, and the angry buzz was now lost amid the clattering and\r\nbanging of shell against shell.\r\n\r\nHaines slid into the front seat behind the steering wheel, stepped on\r\nthe gas, and drove toward a momentary gap in the mob. The jeep tore\r\nthrough, raced around the corner, and headed down an empty street.\r\nCrouching in the back, Burl, Russ, and Ferrati hastily reloaded.\r\n\r\n\"We can't let ourselves get stopped, or even hole up. That A-bomb's\r\ngoing to go off in about twenty minutes, and we'd better be back at the\r\nship before then,\" cried Russ.\r\n\r\nAs they bumped along, they noticed that the Martians who came within\r\nfifty feet of their jeep suddenly stopped whatever they were doing and\r\nturned toward them, hostile. They were like a stick drawn along among\r\nbees--as they traveled they left fury in their wake.\r\n\r\n\"It must be Boulton,\" Russ yelled to Burl above the roar of their\r\npassage. \"He must be charged with the irritating vibration.\"\r\n\r\nBurl nodded as he looked back. The Martians had started after them on\r\nfoot, and could lope fast when they wanted to. \"They've got some sort of\r\norganized action going,\" he called to Haines. \"I think it's steam\r\ncarts!\"\r\n\r\n\"The mass mind caught on fast,\" said Russ. \"And look! They're warned in\r\nadvance now!\"\r\n\r\nThey were nearing the edge of the city, and looming before them,\r\nblocking their right-of-way, were two steam carts--big ones carrying a\r\nlarge number of Martians. They were holding metallic rods and\r\ninstruments in their hand-members.\r\n\r\nFerrati opened a chest built against the back of the seat and took out a\r\nlight machine gun. Climbing into the front, next to Haines, he kneeled\r\ndown behind the windshield, raised the gun, and blazed away.\r\n\r\nThe steam carts suddenly swerved, one after the other, ran wildly into\r\nthe side of a building, and turned over. The jeep roared past them,\r\nraced across the last hundred feet of city paving and out onto the\r\ndesert. Haines had to slow down to navigate safely the uneven layers of\r\nbarren soil, rock and sand. Burl holstered his gun and reached across\r\nfor one of the abandoned walkie-talkies.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of their exit, none had noticed the change in the\r\nMartian scenery. But now it occurred to Burl that the day was distinctly\r\nlighter, and he fancied the Sun--small though it was--felt warmer. The\r\nSun-tap demolished, this was to be expected, and by the same token,\r\nradio communication should now be practical.\r\n\r\nSure enough, he got Lockhart's voice at once. Hastily, he warned the\r\ncommander of what had happened.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer the _Magellan_, the great spaceship lowered toward\r\nthe ground and let down its grapples and ladders. Burl saw that there\r\nwas no time to be lost. A stream of Martians and steam carts was pouring\r\nout of the city on their trail.\r\n\r\nThey reached the spaceship and slammed to a halt. The men leaped out.\r\nBurl and Russ lifted Boulton's unconscious body from the jeep and,\r\nbetween them, managed to hoist him awkwardly up the dangling rope\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nThe others hooked grapples onto the jeep, and when it was secure, leaped\r\nfor safety themselves.\r\n\r\nAs the first of the Martian steam carts was almost on them, the\r\n_Magellan_ lifted into the air. It rose high above the surface and swung\r\noff into the desert. The Martians drew to a halt. Burl, looking down\r\nfrom the doorway of the cargo hatch, could see them milling aimlessly\r\naround. None, he noticed, ever glanced up. Air flight, apparently, was\r\nan inconceivable phenomenon to them.\r\n\r\nAfter the jeep had been pulled into the cargo hold and secured, the\r\nouter ports were sealed. When everyone was safely in the inner sphere,\r\nthe _Magellan_ drew away from Mars and started on the next lap of its\r\nlong mission.\r\n\r\nBoulton was carefully examined. Nothing could be made of his condition.\r\nHe seemed to bear no physical hurt, although he slept on. He was placed\r\nin his bunk, and there he rested, breathing slowly, temperature normal,\r\ndormant.\r\n\r\nThe life of the spaceship resumed, for the time being, without him. The\r\nnext port of call was Jupiter, and that presented problems of its own.\r\nBetween Mars and Jupiter was the great asteroid belt, a region of many\r\nthousands of tiny planetoids, ranging in size from worldlets of two or\r\nthree hundred miles in diameter down to rocks the size of footballs.\r\n\"The debris of an exploded planet,\" was the comment Russ made to Burl.\r\n\"That's the most likely explanation. Anyway,\" he added, \"there seems to\r\nbe no Sun-tap station on any of them. The next one is beyond the\r\nasteroids, in Jupiter's orbit.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days, Lockhart and the two astrogators were busy\r\nworking out a rather complex maneuver, which consisted of having the\r\nship jump over the asteroid belt rather than travel directly through it.\r\nWhile the orbits of thousands of the larger asteroids had been charted,\r\nthere were thousands more that consisted of just chunks of rock too\r\nsmall to notice. They could not chance a collision with one of\r\nthese--yet to work out the whereabouts of all of them was impossibly\r\ntime-consuming.\r\n\r\nWhat the _Magellan_ did was to depart from the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nthat level around the Sun to which all the planets generally adhere, and\r\nto draw outward so as to avoid the path of the asteroids, then to come\r\nback in onto the orbit and plane of Jupiter. This involved some tricky\r\nwork with the various gravitational lines, using Mars and the Sun for\r\nrepulsion and certain stars for attraction.\r\n\r\nThere were quite a number of gravity shifts, and during this period no\r\none could be quite sure what his weight would be from one moment to\r\nanother. There were several periods of zero gravity, when the crew\r\nmembers would float and face the complex annoyances of a steady feeling\r\nof free fall. Burl, after a couple of such sessions, got the hang of it\r\nrather comfortably.\r\n\r\nLockhart looked at him oddly and smiled. \"Glad to know it. I may have a\r\ntask for you soon, then.\"\r\n\r\nOthers found the weightless conditions not so bearable. One of the\r\nengineering crew, Detmar, had to be hospitalized. What he had resembled\r\nsevere seasickness. Oberfield also experienced moments of acute upset.\r\n\r\nBoulton's condition did not change. Once or twice he stirred slightly in\r\nhis sleep, and seemed to murmur something, but then he would lapse back\r\ninto his coma. Fortunately he did not resist food, and did swallow\r\nliquids forced into his mouth.\r\n\r\nExcept for one or two rare intervals, communication with Earth had\r\nceased. Besides, the mother world was now moving away from them and\r\nwould pass behind the Sun. Efforts to obtain medical advice for Boulton\r\nproved futile.\r\n\r\nAfter they had passed the orbital line of the asteroids and had\r\nrearranged their drive so that they were falling freely toward Jupiter,\r\nLockhart called the exploring crew together. \"I've got a job for you\r\nmen,\" he announced.\r\n\r\nHaines, Ferrati, and Burl gathered about the control board to listen.\r\nThey were restless for something to do--plans for the Jupiter landing\r\ncould not be made until they knew what the situation was going to be,\r\nfor it would be one thing if the station were located on that giant\r\nplanet itself, another if on one of its satellites.\r\n\r\nThe colonel wasted no time. \"While you were on Mars and we were waiting\r\nfor you, I took the opportunity to examine the outer shell of this\r\nship. You know, of course, that we are constantly being bombarded by\r\ncosmic dust, the micrometeorites that always prove troublesome to the\r\nEarth satellites and space platforms. The ship has been fortunate in\r\nthat it has not been struck by any meteoric matter of size, but we have\r\nbeen peppered heavily by dust particles. As a result, the outer shell of\r\nour ship is pitted in some spots, and in several places worn perhaps\r\ndangerously thin. I don't mean to imply that there are going to be any\r\nholes very soon, but I think that there are some parts which we should\r\nreinforce or patch.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he stopped for breath, Burl broke in. \"You mean you want us to work\r\non the outer shell?\"\r\n\r\nLockhart nodded. \"Someone has to do it, and during flights you men are\r\nthe deck crew. So it's going to be your baby. I am going to keep the\r\nship on free fall for the next several periods and this should make it\r\nsimpler for you to go outside, in space suits, and do the job.\"\r\n\r\nThe next hour saw all three hard at work. Dressed in heavy, sealed,\r\nwarmed outer-space outfits, wearing metal bowl-like helmets with sealed\r\nglass fronts, and drawing oxygen from tanks strapped on their backs, the\r\nthree men left the inner sphere and emerged on the outer surface of the\r\n_Magellan_.\r\n\r\nBurl found it a weird and awesome experience. There was no gravitational\r\ndrag, so that even as he stepped through the exit port, the scene\r\nshifted until he seemed to be standing on metal ground, looking upward\r\nat thousands and tens of thousands of silent white stars. Nothing\r\nmoved--except, of course, the space-suited bodies of the two men already\r\nhalf out of sight and looking not quite human. There was no sound save\r\nthat of his own breath and the faint hum of the radio phone tucked in\r\nhis helmet.\r\n\r\nHe was firmly attached to the ship by a long nylon rope which he hooked\r\nto rings set on the outer shell. He made his way toward the wide rounded\r\nnose of the ship. In one hand he carried a bucket of a liquid plastic\r\nresembling tar in thickness and consistency. With a brush in the other\r\nhand he would stop--held to the surface by magnetic soles--and smear the\r\nplastic protective surfacing over the little pits and pockmarks that now\r\nmarred the surface of the once spotless ship. The work was not hard, and\r\nshortly became a routine which he found did not require much\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nIt was dip and smear, in a steady rhythmic motion. Haines was working\r\nout of sight on a more complex repair job which involved welding a sheet\r\nof metal over a badly beaten and sprung section. Ferrati was on the\r\nopposite side of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs he worked, Burl watched the stars, and every now and then was\r\nrewarded by the sight of a moving spark of light--an asteroid or meteor.\r\nHe could see mighty Jupiter ahead--a wide disc of white and yellow,\r\nfaintly belted with gray and pale blue bands. The famous red spot was\r\nnot visible. Four of the planet's twelve attendant satellites strung out\r\nalongside it, and he recognized them as the big ones discovered by\r\nGalileo with his first telescope: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\r\nThe other eight were tiny, and probably would not be visible until they\r\nwere right on top of Jupiter, though he supposed that Russell Clyde\r\ncould probably pick them out now by telescopic sightings.\r\n\r\nBurl could hear in his radio the sound of someone whistling softly, and\r\nsupposed it was Ferrati. There was a short cut-in as Lockhart called a\r\ntime-shift on the general intercom. A brief exchange followed between\r\nCaton in the Zeta-ring chamber of the ship's nose and the colonel, with\r\nthe information that Caton was coming down into the living section.\r\n\r\nThen, after a brief period of silence, Burl heard a series of odd noises\r\non his phones, something went bump, and the sound faded. He was now on\r\nthe nose of the ship itself, the wide mushrooming surface beneath his\r\nfeet, and Jupiter high over his head. Bending over, about to smear a dab\r\nof plastic on a tiny pitted mark, he suddenly felt himself gripped and\r\npulled.\r\n\r\nCaught by surprise, he jerked upward, the brush flying from his hand and\r\nsailing into the sky. His shoes clung momentarily to the surface, but\r\ntheir magnetic grip was too weak, and they loosened. He kicked out\r\nwildly, falling away into the emptiness of outer space--a space which\r\nhad a moment ago been a sky and had suddenly turned into a bottomless\r\npit.\r\n\r\nHe fell backward, seized momentarily by terror. He was brought up short\r\nby his rope. It held, and he grabbed it and hung on.\r\n\r\nSomething had changed. Somebody had altered the ship's drive. The ship\r\nwas no longer on free fall; it was on gravity drive--and going backward!\r\nNot driving toward Jupiter under added acceleration, but fighting to\r\nreduce its fall, to stop its drive, to fly away from Jupiter!\r\n\r\nIn his earphones there was a jumble of sounds. He heard Ferrati yelling\r\nand realized that he, too, must be falling away from the ship, saved\r\nonly by a rope. And the voice of Haines--plastered flat against the\r\nsurface, the ship driving upward against him.\r\n\r\nVague noises emanated from the control room. Evidently no one was at the\r\ncommander's mike. He called into it, adding his voice to those of his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nAfter several agonizing minutes, a voice came over the radio. It was\r\nRussell Clyde's and it was excited and angry. \"Hold on out there as long\r\nas you can! Lockhart's been knocked unconscious! We're trying to get\r\ninto the engine room and take back control!\"\r\n\r\nPerplexed, Burl shouted, \"Who's in the engine room? Take control from\r\nwhom?\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause as he heard sounds of pounding, as if someone\r\nwere trying to hammer open a metal panel. Then Russ's voice came on\r\nagain. \"Its Boulton! He came to suddenly, sneaked up here, knocked out\r\nthe commander, and climbed up into the Zeta-ring chamber! Caton was down\r\nbelow--and Boulton's locked the trap door and is running the drive. He's\r\nreversed our route, away from Jupiter, and into outer space! Boulton's\r\napparently gone crazy! And we can't get in to stop him!\"\r\n\r\nBurl, suspended over an abyss, clung to the end of the taut, thin nylon\r\nline, as the ship pulled him helplessly along into the uncharted depths\r\nof infinity, with a mad-man at the controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13. _The Pole of Callisto_\r\n\r\n\r\nBurl surveyed his position. Judging from the apparent weight of his\r\nbody, Boulton was decelerating the ship at a little less than one\r\ngravity. The nylon cord was hooked into a bolt near the center of the\r\nship. It would be possible for Burl to climb up it and reach a firmer\r\ngrip on the outside shell.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost. An increase in the ship's speed might\r\nincrease his weight several times over. He began to climb back, reeling\r\nin the rope, pulling himself up hand over hand, just as he had done many\r\ntimes in the gymnasium of his high school back home.\r\n\r\nHalfway up, Clyde's voice came on his helmet phones. \"Will all members\r\nof the crew report their present positions to me? Haines?\"\r\n\r\nHe called each man's name, beginning with the three outside. Haines and\r\nFerrati were clinging to the surface, on the far--now forward--end of\r\nthe ship. The rest of the crew was somewhere in the living sphere.\r\nLockhart was still unconscious. Burl could hear the faint sounds of a\r\ndiscussion in the control room, and also thumps as Caton and Shea\r\ncontinued to try to break open the entry to the generator chambers.\r\n\r\nThen Russ spoke again. \"Burl, it looks as if you're elected. You seem to\r\nbe the only one in the right place. There's a hatchway into the nose of\r\nthe ship from the outside. It's just below the central circle. Can you\r\nsee it? How close are you to it?\"\r\n\r\nBurl was almost at the surface now. The circular inset ring that marked\r\nthe hatchway entry port was a few feet from where his rope was hooked.\r\nHe described it to Russ.\r\n\r\n\"Can you reach it without losing your grip? If you can, do you think you\r\ncan open it?\" came the radio voice quickly.\r\n\r\nBurl reached the surface and grasped the hook. He studied the circular\r\npanel carefully. \"I can reach it all right. There's a holder hook\r\nalongside it. But what will I do when I get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Open it,\" Russ ordered brusquely. \"It unscrews from either side.\r\nThere's a short lock space between the outer shell and the inner\r\nshielding of the generator chamber. Get inside and seal the door after\r\nyou. From there you can work your way into the emergency nose door to\r\nthe engines. Keep your suit on. While the generators are shielded,\r\nthere's no telling what Boulton may have done. The suit will give you\r\nsome protection.\r\n\r\n\"After you go through the door, it's up to you. Boulton will be there.\r\nYou'll have to stop him, somehow. Caton says if you can find the tool\r\nkit you may be able to get a wrench to use as a weapon. If you can get\r\nthrough without his seeing you and open the trap door to us, we'll do\r\nthe rest. But it depends on you.\"\r\n\r\nBurl bit his lip. \"Okay. Here I go.\" There was no question of argument.\r\nEveryone's life was at stake, and he happened to be in the strategic\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nHe swung over to the panel, hooked his foot under the handgrip and\r\ngrasped the lever inset in the surface. He twisted it. After a brief\r\nmoment of resistance, the panel turned slowly. There was a sudden puff\r\nas the air within escaped, and then the hatchway stood open. Burl\r\nclimbed inside.\r\n\r\nHe caught at the open plug, pulled it back and screwed it tightly from\r\nthe inside. Now he was in a dark, narrow space. He could feel the flow\r\nof air automatically being pumped back in and heard the humming of the\r\ngenerators through his suit.\r\n\r\nWorking his way along the inner wall in darkness, he finally felt the\r\nedge of the metal door that opened into the Zeta-ring chamber itself. He\r\nleaned against it, listening, but there was no sound. He turned the\r\nhandle and threw his shoulder against the door.\r\n\r\nIt gave, then swung open. He stepped cautiously into the engine room.\r\n\r\nIt was large and circular, fitting neatly within the nose of the ship.\r\nThe wide tubes of the A-G generator ring ran around the outside. The\r\nreactors were heavy blocks of ceiling-high metal, shielded, and showing\r\nonly the dials that registered their output. Other machines--the rod\r\nstorage units and the condensers--were all carefully hidden behind clean\r\nmetal shielding.\r\n\r\nThe panel that controlled the engines was unattended in the center of\r\nthe room. Standing by one of the shielded reactors was Boulton, his back\r\nto Burl. He was hammering at the reactor with a bar, evidently trying to\r\ntear away the shielding to get at the guts.\r\n\r\nStealthily, the boy made his way to the locker where the tools were\r\nkept. Just as he opened it, his hand slipped. The door of the locker\r\nclanged against the wall. The burly Marine captain whirled, saw Burl,\r\nand gave a yell of rage.\r\n\r\nBurl grabbed a wrench and swung it threateningly. Boulton drew back. His\r\nface was pale, with an odd expression on it, as if he did not recognize\r\nBurl or understand what Burl said. Burl tried to reason with him, but\r\nthe glaring eyes were those of a total stranger, or, as it seemed then,\r\nan alien beast.\r\n\r\nBoulton cried in anger, dropped his bar, and charged Burl with his hands\r\noutstretched.\r\n\r\nBurl swung the wrench, but the strength of the older man tore it from\r\nhis grasp, hurling it away. The boy tried to dodge, and then the two\r\nbodies collided.\r\n\r\nThe instant the two men touched there was a violent flash of light. Burl\r\nfelt a shock that left him stunned and reeling. Boulton collapsed in a\r\nheap on the floor.\r\n\r\nBurl steadied himself, keeping a wary eye on the captain. Boulton sat up\r\nslowly, putting a hand to his head. \"Boy, that was some kickback,\" he\r\nmuttered. He looked at Burl. \"Give me a hand up. We've got to get back\r\nto the jeep and scram out of here fast. The A-bomb's already set.\"\r\n\r\nBurl was startled. He realized in a moment, though, that Boulton\r\nrecalled nothing of the past few days--his last memory seemed to be of\r\nthe blast in the Martian basement. But now, the captain was apparently\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\nBoulton got shakily to his feet. He seemed confused. \"How'd I get here,\r\nson?\" he asked in surprise.\r\n\r\nBurl gave a sigh of relief. \"I guess you're all right now. But let's get\r\nthe trap door to the control room open. Clyde and Caton have got to get\r\nthe ship back on course. There'll be time to explain afterward.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when Lockhart had recovered and resumed command, the\r\nship was restored to its proper course. Russ filled Boulton in on what\r\nhad happened and ventured a guess as to why.\r\n\r\n\"You must have been given some sort of charge by that globe in the Mars\r\nSun-tap station,\" Russ said. \"It turned you into a sort of robot--a\r\nhuman body running on a charge of alien energy that responded to the\r\ncommands of the Sun-tap outfit. Apparently, it took a long time before\r\nthe charge had complete control of your body. Obviously, it then could\r\nact only in some general way--telling you to wreck the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Burl, your body received a charge a long time ago. Whatever its\r\nnature, it counteracted or shorted Boulton's when you came into\r\ncontact.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Boulton and Burl thought that made sense. \"But,\" Burl conjectured,\r\n\"isn't it possible that the charge in my own body has also been\r\nshorted?\"\r\n\r\nRuss shrugged. \"Maybe. We'll find out at the next stop. And,\r\nincidentally, that's not going to be on Jupiter itself, but on its moon\r\nCallisto. We've traced the line of distortions.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good news,\" said Burl. \"I had the feeling you were worried about\r\nJupiter. The planet's so huge it would have meant real trouble trying to\r\nland. The books say its atmosphere is thick, unbreathable, and moves in\r\ngale velocity around it.\"\r\n\r\nRuss nodded. \"With Jupiter almost 89,000 miles in diameter, it would\r\nhave been a tough problem to maneuver outside this ship ... in fact,\r\nimpossible, not to mention the fact that the atmosphere, mostly ammonia\r\nand other frigid gases, moves in several independent belts. However,\r\nCallisto should be okay.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's something we know about our opponents, anyway,\" said Burl, \"They\r\nmust have physical limitations enough like ours to rule out places where\r\nwe couldn't move, either.\"\r\n\r\nBoulton showed no further effects from his experience. In time, the\r\n_Magellan_ drew near Jupiter. Callisto, its fifth satellite outward,\r\nmoved about the mighty planet at a distance of 1,170,000 miles. It was a\r\nlarge satellite as they go, 3,220 miles in diameter, larger, in fact,\r\nthan Mercury. But, as Russ explained, it was a queer place in its own\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nFor despite its size, Callisto was apparently not a solid body as we\r\nthink of it. Its density totaled only a little more than that of water,\r\nits mass half that of the Earth's Moon--a notoriously porous body.\r\n\r\nThey bore down on Callisto, matching their speed to its, and swung close\r\nto its surface. It had almost no atmosphere, just a thin layer of the\r\nheavier gases. It was a belted world, without clearly defined continents\r\nor surface markings. Its equatorial zone was one vast, featureless belt\r\nof darkish-gray. Its temperate zones were white, with patches of yellow\r\nhere and there. But its poles were gray again.\r\n\r\n\"The satellite's like a huge ball of thin mud that's never hardened,\"\r\nsaid Burl as they studied the strange terrain.\r\n\r\n\"The equator's the softest--it seems to be a river of muddy water,\r\nhundreds of miles wide--only it can't be water. Probably semisolidified\r\ngases holding dust and grains of matter in suspension,\" said Russ. \"The\r\ntemperate zones are the same stuff, only colder, and therefore more\r\nstable. A thin crust of frozen gases over a planet-wide ocean of\r\nsemiliquid substance.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Sun-tap station's on the southern pole,\" said Burl. \"That must be\r\nsolid.\"\r\n\r\nIt was. The poles of Callisto were actually two continent-sized islands\r\nof shell. Dry, mudlike stuff, hard as rock, floating on the endless seas\r\nof the semiliquid planet.\r\n\r\nThe station, a ringed setup quite like the one on Earth, stood in the\r\ngeographic center of the south pole. The _Magellan_ hovered over it\r\nwhile a landing party went down in the four-man rocket plane.\r\n\r\nClyde, Haines and Burl were the landing party. This time, only Burl\r\nentered the station after a hole had been blasted in the outer shell.\r\nWhile the redheaded astronomer took samples and made observations,\r\nHaines kept watch. Nobody knew what type of defense awaited them here.\r\n\r\nBurl found the controls easily enough. He was afraid that he might have\r\nlost his physical charge, but it was not so. The controls functioned,\r\nthe Sun-tap station died. The effect was not very noticeable, for\r\nCallisto was already far from the Sun and the thin atmosphere could not\r\ndiminish the dark sky of outer space. What the great masts caught must\r\nhave been only the relay from other stations--or perhaps the invisible\r\nrays of the distant Sun.\r\n\r\nBurl saw no reason to linger, and the three of them gathered up their\r\nequipment. As they started back toward the rocket plane, they heard an\r\nominous rumble in the ground.\r\n\r\nA sudden spurt of blazing gas shot up from the center of the station.\r\n\"Duck!\" yelled Haines, and they fell flat on the ground. Burl held his\r\nhands protectively over his head, as an explosion shook the building.\r\n\r\nThere was no rain of rocks. Whatever the blast, Callisto's gravity was\r\ntoo weak to attract the debris that flew high above the station.\r\n\r\n\"It was an atomic explosion!\" Haines shouted into his helmet mike. \"They\r\nmined the station. Run for it!\"\r\n\r\nThey raced for the rocket plane. As they ran, Burl felt the ground\r\nquiver beneath him, and huge cracks began to spread, rippling through\r\nthe hard ground.\r\n\r\nThey reached the plane and piled in. Russ took off just as the surface\r\ncracked open in a thousand places like an ice sheet breaking in an\r\nArctic thaw.\r\n\r\nAs they rocketed back to the _Magellan_, the whole polar cap, an area\r\nhundreds of miles around the Sun-tap station, split apart. Great spurts\r\nof liquid magma, the liquid gas-dust from the heart of the planet, shot\r\nup like fountains. Parts of the shell-like polar continent were\r\ndisappearing beneath this new ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Their little atomic bomb shattered the thin crust. The whole polar\r\nisland will probably sink,\" said Russ. \"It was a clever trap. They knew\r\nwhat would happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saturn next,\" said Burl. \"What'll they have set up there?\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the _Magellan_, loaded the rocket plane aboard, and pulled\r\nout, setting their course for the ringed planet. But even as they did\r\nso, something was coming from Saturn to meet them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14. _Rockets Away!_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next lap of their journey was uneventful. Saturn, the next outward\r\nplanet from the Sun, and the second largest, would present the same\r\nproblem as Jupiter. This world, famous for its mysterious rings, was\r\nabout 71,000 miles in diameter and had a large family of\r\nsatellites--nine in all. The Sun-tap station would be on one of these,\r\nBurl thought.\r\n\r\nSaturn was also almost as far out from Jupiter as Jupiter itself had\r\nbeen from the Sun. This meant that the trip would be as long for the\r\n_Magellan_ as the distance they had already traveled to get to Jupiter.\r\nFortunately the A-G drive was a remarkable thing--it was possible to\r\naccelerate to fantastic speeds--in theory, probably right up to the\r\nspeed of light. And so, where great distances were concerned, the ship\r\nsimply rushed its fall through on Saturn's line of gravitation.\r\n\r\nBoulton had fully recovered and showed no lingering signs of the strange\r\nelectronic charge. Because of the limited size of the crew, Lockhart put\r\nthe Marine captain back on full duty--he would participate in future\r\nlandings as if nothing had ever happened.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Lockhart cautioned Haines, Burl and Ferrati to keep\r\ntheir eyes on him. It was always possible that the foe's weapon had made\r\nsome more lasting mark.\r\n\r\nHaines had his group make a new inventory of their weapons. Burl,\r\nworking with them in a space suit, in the partially protected region of\r\nthe cargo hull, was surprised at the variety. There was a second rocket\r\nplane, a two-man outfit. In addition, they had a large store of\r\noffensive weapons, including a small but formidable supply of atomic\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\nHaines gave Burl and Ferrati--who were new to military weapons--brief\r\nintroductory lectures on their use. Burl saw just what a hand-sized,\r\ntactical atomic shell looked like and how it worked. He learned how to\r\noperate the heavy-caliber rocket gun which hurled this tiniest of atomic\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\nAnd so the time passed, and the amazing disc of Saturn began to grow in\r\ntheir viewplates. It was banded, much like Jupiter, and its brilliant\r\nrings surrounded it with a mystic halo that set it apart from all the\r\nother worlds of the Sun's family.\r\n\r\nBurl was watching Saturn through the largest of the nose viewplates when\r\nhe thought that he saw a black dot crossing its face. He had located the\r\nknown moons of Saturn and this was not one of them. Excited, he called\r\nRussell Clyde. \"Could it be a tenth satellite?\" he asked, pointing out\r\nthe tiny dot.\r\n\r\nRuss squinted his eyes; then, calculating mentally, he shook his head,\r\n\"I don't think so. It looks to me more like something that's in space\r\nbetween us and Saturn. In fact--it must be fairly close to us for us to\r\nsee it at all.\" He turned to Lockhart who was at the control panel with\r\nOberfield.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better have a look. Could be a giant meteor coming in our\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're moving mighty fast,\" commented Oberfield. \"It should have passed\r\nus already if it were a meteor. Instead, it seems to be maintaining the\r\nsame distance--neither growing larger nor smaller. Acts very odd for a\r\nnatural body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, uh,\" said Lockhart. \"This calls for caution.\" He quickly went back\r\nto the controls, pressed the general alarm button, then called into the\r\nintercom. \"All hands to emergency stations. Haines and party, please\r\nprepare defensive positions.\"\r\n\r\n\"This means me,\" gulped Burl, and scooted down the central hatch, almost\r\ncolliding with Caton and Shea on their way to the engine room. He met\r\nHaines, and, with neat dispatch, all four slipped into space suits. Then\r\nout through the cargo hold to posts by escape hatches.\r\n\r\nBurl and Haines, at the main entry port, unlimbered the long rocket\r\nlauncher that had been set up in the passageway. Haines placed three\r\nshells of differing strength in position.\r\n\r\nThey heard through their helmet phones that the mysterious dot was\r\ndrawing closer. Haines set up one of the launching racks, which was\r\nequipped with a telescopic sighter, and peered through the eyepiece.\r\nApparently he caught it, for he grunted, then motioned to Burl to take a\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nIt was no natural object. It was the shape of a dumbbell--two spheres\r\njoined together by a short middle bar. One sphere was a deep, golden\r\ncolor, the other a bluish-silver, the connecting rod a coppery metal.\r\n\r\n\"The pattern of spheres certainly suggests the Sun-tappers to me,\" said\r\nBurl. Haines murmured his agreement.\r\n\r\nLockhart's voice came on the phones. \"We've decided it's one of the\r\nSun-tapper ships. We're not going to wait to make sure. Before we left\r\nEarth, I can now inform you, I received a directive from the President\r\nto regard the builders of these Sun-tap stations as active enemies. My\r\norders are that we are not to attempt to undertake peaceful contact, but\r\nare to treat them on sight as armed foes in the field. To do otherwise\r\nis to risk Earth's last active defense--this ship.\r\n\r\n\"I think I don't have to argue this further, considering our recent\r\nexperiences.\" His voice hesitated, then rang out firmly, \"Haines, you\r\ncan commence firing at will!\"\r\n\r\nHaines clicked his tongue and reached for one of the shells. \"Okay,\r\nBurl, aim at her direct. This one's got a proximity nose that'll beam at\r\nher and drive itself where ever she ducks.\"\r\n\r\nHe slid the rocket shell into the launcher, Burl sighted, and then\r\nHaines pressed the trigger. There was a whoosh of fire and a flare from\r\nthe launcher's nose. A minute spark winged into the darkness toward the\r\nspot, still many miles away, where the strange ship hung.\r\n\r\nThey watched with bated breath. Suddenly there was a flash of light from\r\nthe other ship--a vivid lightning bolt which leaped out and flared up\r\nbriefly in space. Then darkness again.\r\n\r\n\"They fired a burst of energy at us. It hit the rocket shell instead,\"\r\nsaid Haines. \"Well, now we know. They use bolts of pure\r\nenergy--something like the one they fired at Boulton.\"\r\n\r\nHe fitted another shell into the launcher, and fired again. Again a\r\nspark winged its way, and the bolt of energy burst out to detonate the\r\nshell. Burl whistled. \"How did they spot it so fast?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they did. They're firing at us--the rocket shell only\r\nhappened to be between,\" snapped Haines.\r\n\r\n\"Ferrati,\" he called into his mike, \"fire a shrapnel shell at them when\r\nI say the word. Advise me when ready!\"\r\n\r\nFerrati's voice snapped back. \"Right you are, sir. Here it is now, one\r\nminute--okay, on target!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Ferrati and Boulton were readying their shot from the lower cargo\r\nport near the tail of the ship, Haines and Burl had been fitting the\r\nlargest of their shells into their own launcher. They aimed it\r\ncarefully at the front-most sphere of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Ferrati, fire!\" cried Haines, and then slowly counted to five and\r\npressed the stud of his own launcher.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary flicker as Ferrati's rocket shell raced forth\r\nbelow. Then, after a definite time lapse, the exhaust of Haines' heavy\r\nshell appeared.\r\n\r\n\"The shrapnel shell is segmented and doesn't have a proximity guide,\"\r\nHaines explained. \"As soon as it's on its way, the nose comes apart into\r\na dozen small shells, each with a standard explosive charge. The shell\r\nwe used has an atomic bomb warhead and is on proximity guide. It'll\r\nchase that ship to the ends of the system if they don't blast it first.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. There was another bolt of raw energy from the dumbbell-shaped\r\ncraft, and this time a series of flares in the space between--the\r\nshrapnel charges had been touched off. Burl held his breath.\r\n\r\n\"I figure it takes them a while to recharge their gun,\" said Haines.\r\n\"Our own blockbuster should get there before they fire again.\"\r\n\r\nThen suddenly there came a sharper flare of brilliant light. For an\r\ninstant Burl was blinded by the glare. When he recovered, he peered\r\navidly through the telescopic sighter. He saw the ship, but where there\r\nhad been a golden sphere there was now only a shattered fragment of\r\ntwisted metal.\r\n\r\nThe enemy ship changed before his eyes. The remaining silvery sphere\r\nglowed brighter, and took on a golden hue. Then it seemed as if the\r\nship were growing smaller. He realized finally that it was retreating.\r\n\r\nBurl gave an involuntary shout, and in his earphones he heard the same\r\nshouts of triumph from every voice on the ship.\r\n\r\nAlthough it might have been possible to pursue the battered enemy ship,\r\nthe _Magellan_ did not try. They were still on course for Saturn and\r\nwere not going to deviate.\r\n\r\nThey reached Saturn after several more days. Matching their great speed\r\nwith that of the ringed world in its orbit took time, and then they\r\nbegan their survey.\r\n\r\nAs they had suspected, the Sun-tap station was on one of the moons. The\r\nmoon was called Iapetus, the third largest of Saturn's family. It was\r\nabout eight hundred miles in diameter and the next to the farthest\r\nsatellite from Saturn. Russ was disappointed that they hadn't picked\r\nTitan, the biggest moon of all. Titan was over two thousand miles wide\r\nand appeared to have an atmosphere of methane.\r\n\r\nThe view of Saturn was awesome, even from Iapetus' orbit two million\r\nmiles away. Burl knew it would be a sight unparalleled in the system.\r\nThe great broad rings, composed of innumerable tiny particles of metal,\r\nstone, and possibly ice, encircled it as if held there by an invisible\r\nhand. They were, he knew, the particles of a moon that had either come\r\ntoo close to Saturn's great gravitational pull to hold its shape, or\r\nelse had never escaped far enough to congeal as one solid mass.\r\n\r\nIapetus was a solid world, though. A rocky body, it had a dull gleam,\r\nand was streaked here and there with layers of white and yellow, where\r\nveins of frozen gases lay forever upon the frigid surface. No atmosphere\r\nveiled the surface nor softened the harsh, jagged mountains and clefts\r\nof this forbidding little subplanet.\r\n\r\nThe Sun-tap station stood in plain sight on a high plateau near a polar\r\nregion. The _Magellan_ hovered over it while Lockhart held a council of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what's to be gained by attempting a landing party,\" he\r\nsaid. \"We've taken all the readings and pictures of the other\r\nstations--and we've had a couple of narrow escapes. They've probably\r\nmined this one, and they have had plenty of time to prepare a trap. I'm\r\nin favor of simply dropping an H-bomb on it and leaving.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a brief discussion, with only perfunctory objections from Clyde\r\nand Oberfield who, as astronomers, wanted to land to take other\r\nreadings, the decision was carried.\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ swung up a couple of hundred miles above the Sun-tappers'\r\nplateau. Haines and his crew loaded the bulky H-bomb into the main\r\nlauncher in the tail of the ship. Then the _Magellan_ aimed itself at\r\nthe target, and the rocket-driven bomb roared out.\r\n\r\nDown it sped, zeroing in on the wall of the station. There was a\r\nblinding flash, a glare as brilliant as that of the Sun itself, as it\r\nhit square on the mark. This time Burl watched through carefully\r\nshielded viewscreens. The scene was obscured by a wide-flung cloud of\r\nwhite--tens of thousands of cubic feet of satellite rock turned\r\ninstantaneously into dust particles. After the dust cleared away, they\r\nsaw only a gaping crater where the plateau had been--a volcanic hole,\r\nmiles wide and glowing red, from which spread vast, deep cracks\r\nthroughout the entire visible hemisphere of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe men on the _Magellan_ were awed and silent. The thought occurred to\r\neach of them, beyond his capacity to deny it: what if this had happened\r\non Earth?\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Ferrati slowly, \"the low gravity of Iapetus accounts\r\nfor the greater extent of the disaster. If this had been Bikini or....\"\r\nBut under the glares of the rest of the crew, his sentence trailed off\r\nweakly.\r\n\r\nLockhart turned away from the viewer. \"Mr. Oberfield,\" he said,\r\nunexpectedly formal and official, \"you may chart our course for Uranus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said that usually dour personage, with alacrity.\r\n\r\nWith forced smiles, the rest of the crew drifted away to their duties.\r\nThe _Magellan_ pulled away from Saturn, heading out again toward the\r\nlimits of the solar system, but it was several days before everyone had\r\nquite managed to dismiss the vision of the H-bomb from his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15. _Ice Cold on Oberon_\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from that point on, a different spirit seemed to animate\r\neveryone aboard the _Magellan_. There was the feeling that they had\r\nclosed with the enemy and found themselves not wanting. There was the\r\nfeeling that they possessed powers not inferior to those of their\r\nunknown enemies. The thought had been haunting them all along that they\r\nwere in the position of a backward people facing an advanced\r\ninvader--something like the problem of the Aztecs when faced with the\r\ngunpowder and armor of the conquistadors.\r\n\r\nNow they knew that though the Sun-tappers' weapons were different and\r\nindeed advanced beyond Earthly technology, they themselves were not\r\nwithout resources equally deadly to the foe.\r\n\r\nAfter the memory of the H-bomb's powers had been finally absorbed, the\r\ncrew's activities began to indicate that the ship was coming into the\r\ncrucial phase of its journey. Haines and Boulton were going over the\r\nlist of military supplies with sharp, calculating eyes and slight grins\r\nat the thought of retribution to come. Ferrati was overhauling the\r\nrocket planes and land traveling devices, making them shipshape.\r\n\r\nRussell Clyde and Burl surveyed the sky, anxious to be the first to spot\r\nwhat they hoped would be the limping body of the battered and fleeing\r\ndumbbell ship, a little atingle at the hope of spotting another such\r\nship--feeling now almost like the hunting dog that has finally spotted\r\nthe fox.\r\n\r\nLockhart himself reflected this mood of growing excitement. He prowled\r\nthe ship, examining the mighty purring engines, querying Caton, Shea and\r\nDetmar as to how it could better its performance, how fast it could be\r\nmade to shift speed and directions. He studied the orbits and locations\r\nof the remaining planets.\r\n\r\n\"Uranus is not too far off our path to Pluto,\" he announced one day.\r\n\"We'll make it in time to wipe out their plant there. But Neptune, whose\r\norbit is between those of Uranus and Pluto, is away off our track, a\r\nthird of the way around the Sun. We're going to skip it, hit directly\r\nfor Pluto and their main base--the end of their line. I don't want to\r\ngive them too much time to make repairs or to get any reinforcements. I\r\nthink they're limited in numbers--and we ought to slam them while they\r\nstill are.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no dissent at this. And as the days rolled past, the men of\r\nthe _Magellan_ began to chafe in their repressed desire to finish the\r\nmatter. At last Uranus came into sight--a large globe, very much like\r\nSaturn and Jupiter in that it was of low density and great dimensions.\r\nRoughly, sixty-four times the size of Earth, its density was barely\r\nabove that of water and it probably had no solid surface to speak of. An\r\ninhospitable mass of unbreathable gases, at temperatures fantastically\r\nlower than the freezing point of water.\r\n\r\nAs they drew close to the planet, they could see that it also was\r\nbanded, pale green bands alternating with lighter ones--indicating that\r\nsome sections of its atmospheric belt moved faster than others. It had\r\nfive moons which rotated in the opposite direction from those of any\r\nother satellite system.\r\n\r\nIt was on the farthest moon, Oberon, a sphere six hundred miles in\r\ndiameter, that the Sun-tap station revealed itself. They swung down to\r\nobserve it and to place their bomb. Not an H-bomb though--they\r\nrecognized that they had erred in thinking they needed such a powerful\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\nOberon was without an atmosphere, a rocky world with streaks of frozen\r\ngases, and here and there the sheen of a lake of ice--ice that would\r\nnever melt--that on this world would be a permanent, hard-as-metal\r\nmaterial. There was, nonetheless, something about the surface that\r\nseemed to bother Russ.\r\n\r\n\"Do you notice what seems to be a sort of shifting movement?\" he asked\r\nBurl. Burl looked, and sure enough, he saw that in places there seemed a\r\nflickering of lights.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I see it. What do you suppose it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Russ, \"But I'm going to ask Lockhart to put the\r\nship down and let me take a look.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart at first demurred, but finally decided that they could afford\r\nthe brief halt. The _Magellan_ approached the surface, safely distant\r\nfrom the Sun-tap station.\r\n\r\nBurl and Russ descended in the two-man rocket plane, while the\r\nteardrop-shaped ship hung half a mile above them. They landed on a\r\nnarrow plain, bordered by low ridges of mountains shining with streaks\r\nof frozen hydrogen. A layer of cosmic dust hung over the rocks.\r\n\r\nWearing insulated space suits, they left the rocket plane. It was Burl\r\nwho made the first discovery. He pointed dramatically at the ground.\r\n\"Look, Russ. This dust is full of streaks and marks. It hasn't been\r\nlying here undisturbed. Something has crossed over it!\"\r\n\r\nRuss kneeled in order to look more carefully. The layer of dust, the\r\nconsequences of an airless world exposed without protection to the\r\nendless fall of cosmic particles, was indeed not the level, undisturbed\r\nsurface it should have been. Here and there were light, low depressions,\r\nas if something had moved across it--like a small snake crawling on its\r\nbelly. In one place lay a series of depressions, like the footprints of\r\nsome light-bodied creature.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" muttered Russ. \"Life can't exist here.\"\r\n\r\nBut they trudged on, across the barren flat to a ridge of rock. Here\r\nthey found what they had thought to be impossible. Clustered along the\r\nside of the ridge, in the faint light of the distant and tiny Sun, was a\r\nseries of thin, blue stalks, about half a foot in height. On each stalk\r\nwas a flat scalloped top like a little umbrella. It was sometimes bright\r\nblue, and sometimes violet. As they drew nearer, these little stalks\r\nbegan to sway, and turned their tops toward them.\r\n\r\n\"They look like plants,\" said Burl. \"Plants made of something glassy and\r\nplastic.\"\r\n\r\nAs Russ studied the strange growths, something moved across the dusty\r\ntract behind them. It was long and thin and wiggly, with a ridge of tiny\r\ncrystalline hairs along its back. It was like a snake perhaps, but one\r\nmade of some unbelievably delicate glasswork.\r\n\r\nIt slid among the plants and wrapped itself around one. The growth\r\nsnapped suddenly, and then was absorbed by the creature.\r\n\r\nRuss shook his head in amazement. \"This is a great discovery,\" he said\r\nincredulously. \"This is life! It's life of a chemical type utterly\r\ndifferent from the protoplasm of Earth and Mars and Venus. It's life\r\ndesigned to exist among liquid gases and frozen air--life which can't\r\nhave anything in common with protoplasm. Apparently it couldn't exist\r\neven on Saturn's moons--they were too _hot_ for it!\"\r\n\r\nRuss was carried away with the possibilities. \"This hints at great\r\nthings, Burl. Out near Pluto, where the system is even colder, there may\r\nbe other forms of this frigi-plasmic life, if I may coin a word. This\r\nmeans a whole new science!\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the ship with their astonishing news. The _Magellan_\r\nslowly skimmed over the surface of Oberon. They found whole forests of\r\nthis glassy frigid vegetation, but not much evidence of any animal life\r\nlarger than the creature the two explorers had seen.\r\n\r\nOver the Sun-tap station--a ringed layout like the others, whose cluster\r\nof masts caught the emanations of the distant Sun on the one hand and\r\ndirected them outward to the still unseen planet Pluto on the other--the\r\nship halted. It drew up fifty miles, pointed its tail and blasted forth\r\na rocket-driven, tactical atomic bomb.\r\n\r\nThe blast on Oberon was tiny compared to the one which had devastated\r\nIapetus, but it still left a deep indentation in the surface for future\r\nspace fliers to see.\r\n\r\nThey left it and the Uranian orbit behind them and headed outward once\r\nagain. Behind them now lay the worlds of the Sun's family, while far off\r\nto one side lay the tiny light of Neptune. Ahead, between them and the\r\nvast gulf of interstellar space, lay only the dark, mysterious ninth\r\nplanet, the enigmatic world named after the lord of the underworld,\r\nPluto.\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ plunged on, in constant acceleration, moving outward to\r\nthe farthest limit of the solar system. They had traveled almost one\r\nbillion, eight hundred million miles from the Sun--and yet they still\r\nhad two billion miles more to go. This was the longest stretch--and\r\nduring it, they would reach speeds greater than any they had touched\r\nbefore. They shot outward, faster and faster, eating up the infinite\r\nemptiness of space, driving the vast stretch that divided Pluto from its\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, already small, dwindled steadily. It was still the brightest\r\nstar in their sky--of all the stars, it alone retained a disclike shape,\r\nand the faint flicker of its coronal flames could occasionally be made\r\nout--but it no longer dominated the heavens. To find the Sun, they now\r\nhad to look for it as they would for any other star.\r\n\r\nAs for Earth, it could not be seen. So close to the tiny Sun it lay that\r\nonly their sharpest telescopes could bring it out. Even Jupiter showed\r\nup only as a thin, tiny crescent near the solar point of light.\r\n\r\n\"Pluto's a mysterious world,\" said Burl as he and Russ scanned the\r\nheavens for a first glimpse of it. \"The accounts in your astronomy books\r\ngive very little real information on it--but what they give is strange.\r\nThey say it's the only planet beyond Mars that is a small solid world\r\nlike the inner ones. It seems to be the same size as Earth--not at all\r\nlike the big outer worlds. And they say it seems to be the same mass as\r\nEarth--a solid world whose surface gravity would be the same as our own\r\nplanet's.\"\r\n\r\nRuss nodded. \"It's an odd one, all right. There's now even some belief\r\nthat it's not a true planet, but one that was once a satellite of\r\nNeptune. Its orbit is peculiar; it apparently may cut into that of\r\nNeptune. In fact, everything hints at Pluto not being a true child of\r\nour Sun. It may be a world captured from afar--a lonely wanderer cast\r\noff from some other star, captured by the Sun after millions of years of\r\ndrifting lightless through space.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond them, in their vision, lay only the stars of outer space, the\r\nvoid that did not belong to our system. And then, finally, they found\r\nPluto--a tiny point of light shining among the blazing stars. They saw\r\nthe disc, dimly reflected in the light of the far-away Sun.\r\n\r\nEven as they were taking their first long look at the dark planet, the\r\ngeneral alarm rang. They had caught up with the fleeing wreck of the\r\nSun-tapper's scout cruiser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16. _In Orbit Around Pluto_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a mad rush to action stations. Detmar, Ferrati and Oberfield,\r\nwho had been in their bunks, dashed to their posts while others tried to\r\npass them in both directions. Haines and Burl hastily climbed into their\r\nspace suits, while Ferrati and Boulton manned the inner defensive\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nBurl pulled the tight-fitting harness of his insulated space suit over\r\nhim. The shape of the Sun-tapper ship came into focus on the tiny screen\r\nof the air lock viewer. It was approaching them at a frighteningly rapid\r\npace. He could see the broken framework of one of its two globes--the\r\none on which they had scored their hit. The other globe and the\r\nconnecting passages were strikingly clear. Tiny circles of windows were\r\nvisible in the passage section, which undoubtedly housed the operators\r\nof the vessel. For a fleeting instant he realized that as yet none of\r\nthe Earthlings had any inkling of what these creatures looked like.\r\n\r\nWhile he knew that the scene was telescopic, the ship was undoubtedly\r\napproaching them fast; or rather, they were catching up to it at a\r\nperilous pace! Whether the wrecked enemy had slowed down more than they\r\nhad, as it approached its Plutonian base, or whether some other surprise\r\nlay ahead, they had no idea.\r\n\r\nBurl felt the jarring impact as Lockhart cut the _Magellan's_ drive.\r\nThere was an instant of weightlessness, and then their weight reversed\r\nas the A-G drive strove to slow down the ship. Within the air lock they\r\nwere outside the living space of the sphere, suspended beneath the drive\r\nchamber. Burl could see the walls of the inner sphere whirl past him, a\r\nfoot away, as the living quarters rotated to shift with the\r\ngravitational change. And at that very moment, while all those inside\r\nwere temporarily helpless, disaster struck.\r\n\r\nBurl had just finished adjusting his airtight helmet, and Haines was\r\nalready on his way forward to the outer shell port and the rocket guns,\r\nwhen there was a flash of lightning from the crippled enemy spaceship.\r\nThe foe was still capable of fighting--and it had fired\r\nfirst--alarmingly close.\r\n\r\nWithin what seemed a split second after Burl's eyes had registered the\r\nflash on the little viewplate, the _Magellan_ received the full force of\r\nthe mighty electronic discharge. To Burl it seemed as if a thunderclap\r\nhad sounded in his ears, and as if he had been plunged into a bath of\r\nwhite flames. The walls of the passage sparked brilliantly, blinding\r\nlight filled the air, and Burl's body vibrated as it would to an\r\nelectric shock.\r\n\r\nHe reeled wildly, catching at the walls and almost falling. In a few\r\nseconds his senses recovered, although his body was still humming from\r\nthe blow and his ears were ringing. The viewplate had gone black, the\r\nlights in the air lock corridor were dark, and when he tried to gain his\r\nfeet he realized that the ship now had no gravity; it was falling free\r\nwithout power.\r\n\r\nHaines was slumped in the end of the corridor, with the port nearly\r\nopened. Burl pushed his way over to him and helped the groggy explorer\r\nto his feet. There was no sound, and Burl suddenly remembered that he\r\nhadn't taken time to switch on his helmet phone. He did so and was\r\nrelieved to hear Harness voice asking if he was all right.\r\n\r\n\"I'm okay,\" Burl called. \"Let's get this port open. Maybe we can hit\r\nback at least once.\"\r\n\r\nTogether, they turned the bolts and pushed the thick outer shell door\r\nopen. Without the aid of telescopic sights they could see the shape of\r\nthe Sun-tapper vessel plainly, outlined against the curtain of distant\r\nstars. Struggling not to think of what might be going on within the\r\n_Magellan_--their earphones registered nothing except each other--they\r\nunlimbered the long tube of the rocket launcher and aimed point-blank at\r\nthe foe. Haines reached into the ammunition locker vault alongside the\r\npassageway and selected the biggest and wickedest of the available\r\nshells. He twisted the dial in the warhead and, while Burl held the aim,\r\nshoved in the rocket shell. With a press of the button, the missile\r\nroared out of the tube, racing in an arc of fire directly toward the\r\nfaint vision of the other ship.\r\n\r\nThey watched with bated breath, counting the seconds, hoping not to see\r\nanother blast of electrical fire. But apparently the foe had exhausted\r\nits limited resources, for the thin spidery line of rocket sparks\r\nreached out, farther and farther, until it seemed to touch the surface\r\nof the golden globe.\r\n\r\nThere was a great flare in the sky now, an outpouring of fire and hot\r\nmetal. When it cleared away, the sky was empty.\r\n\r\nHaines wearily drew the outer port shut. \"Now, let's see if we're\r\ngoners, too,\" he said quietly. They sealed the outer shell and made\r\ntheir way along the dark passage.\r\n\r\nEven as they were unlocking the toggles of the inner hatch, the corridor\r\nlights started to flicker. They would light up dimly, and then flicker\r\nout, light up again, flare for an instant, then die down. Someone was\r\nalive within the ship.\r\n\r\nThey got the hatch open. In the central section of the living sphere,\r\nthe lights were also dim and in a few places they were completely out.\r\nThey emerged and closed the hatch behind them. Only after Haines had\r\ntested the inner atmosphere and found it still pressurized, did they\r\nopen their helmets and climb stiffly out of the space suits, wincing at\r\nbruises they had sustained but had not noticed until then.\r\n\r\nThe air pressure was all right, but there was a smell of burned rubber\r\nand insulation in the air. Now that their helmets were off, they could\r\nhear voices somewhere above. They found Oberfield lying unconscious,\r\nthrown to the floor by the sudden shift of the ship. They climbed into\r\nthe control room. Lockhart was floating in the air near the open\r\nhatchway leading to the engine room overhead. He was calling out orders\r\nto someone who was within.\r\n\r\nRuss was working over the navigation desk, a bandage around his head,\r\ntrying to figure out where they would be and where they were heading,\r\nwithout having access to the still dark viewplates.\r\n\r\nLockhart twisted in the weightless air when he saw them. He seemed both\r\nrelieved and distressed. \"I'm glad you're okay, but I had hoped you'd be\r\nable to put in a blow for us.\"\r\n\r\nBurl realized that inside the ship they had no way of knowing that\r\nvengeance had been served. Hastily, he explained. His words cheered\r\neveryone. Russ and Lockhart shouted joyously. Detmar poked his head down\r\nthe hatch and called the news back to his two fellows who were\r\nstruggling to get the A-G generators functioning.\r\n\r\nThe bolt of energy, whatever it may have been designed to do to a ship\r\nof the Sun-tapper build, did not have the totally disastrous effect on\r\nthe _Magellan_ that it was intended to have. It had knocked out their\r\nelectrical system temporarily, burned out some of its parts and caused\r\nthe A-G system to fail, although the atomic piles were impervious to\r\nsuch currents. Oberfield, Ferrati and Shea were badly hurt.\r\n\r\nThere now followed an anxious period during which more and more of the\r\nelectrical system began to function as the men labored to rig up\r\nemergency wires, and to replace burned out bulbs and lines. There was a\r\ngeneral cheer when the viewplates flickered into life again, though not\r\nall functioned. They again had access to the sky about them--even though\r\nnot all sectors were covered.\r\n\r\nThe humming in the engine room started up, rose and fell uneasily a\r\ncouple of times, and then they felt a surge of force. Lockhart fell\r\ngently to the floor as the ship began to drive ahead, and then in a few\r\nminutes the A-G drive was back on, and the _Magellan_ was again under\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\"We took what they had to give, and it wasn't enough,\" exulted Haines.\r\n\"Now wait till we reach their main works. We'll show them!\"\r\n\r\nLockhart shook his head wearily as he and Russ worked over the controls.\r\n\"Let's hope we don't have to show them soon. Our ship is running on\r\nemergency rigging. Caton says he's going to have to rest the ship and\r\nrewire a good part of the system. Meanwhile, we will be able to reach\r\nPluto safely enough.\"\r\n\r\nPluto was visible in the forward viewplates. They could see lighter and\r\ndarker patches on it, almost like the markings of continents and oceans,\r\nbut there was no evidence of an atmosphere, nor had they expected any.\r\n\r\nReadings showed that the average surface temperature was about 200°\r\nFahrenheit below zero, even lower in many places. They searched the\r\nsurface for signs of their foe.\r\n\r\nThey found what they wanted on the north polar depression, a basin in\r\nthe oblate sphere of Pluto. There was no ringed station. There rose a\r\nvast pile of dark masonry--a mighty structure covering at least a square\r\nmile, a fortress building whose roofs bristled with an array of masts\r\nand reflectors. And hanging on patrol over this polar basin were two\r\nmore of the dumbbell ships.\r\n\r\n\"We're in no position to come to grips with them,\" said Lockhart. \"I'm\r\ngoing to take the _Magellan_ into a low orbit around Pluto's equator.\r\nWe'll be out of their sight, yet near enough to do some probing and\r\nexploring while we're making repairs.\"\r\n\r\nThis they proceeded to do, swinging the ship down to within a few\r\nhundred miles of the Plutonian surface, setting on a fixed orbit around\r\nthe equator, exactly as the sputniks of years past had first circled the\r\nbulk of the Earth. Staying far enough up to maintain orbit, they were\r\nclose enough to be below the planet's radiation belt.\r\n\r\nTaking stock of the ship's condition showed that they dearly needed this\r\ndelay. Repairs would not be completed for several days. Practically\r\neveryone had been bruised or shaken up; Oberfield had a fractured skull\r\nand was in serious condition; Ferrati had broken his leg and pelvis;\r\nShea had a couple of cracked ribs. The men were given emergency medical\r\ntreatment and confined to quarters.\r\n\r\nThe _Magellan_ quietly circled Pluto once every hour and a half and the\r\nship tried to resume its normal life. Russ studied the surface beneath\r\nthem, Haines and Burl at his elbow. Then, after conferring, the three\r\napproached Lockhart.\r\n\r\n\"We want permission to make a landing,\" Russ said. \"If we take the\r\nfour-man rocket plane we can make the ground safely. We've got to\r\nreconnoiter before we can figure out how to put this master Sun-tap\r\nstation out of business.\"\r\n\r\nLockhart agreed. \"I was planning as much. Now that we're here, we can't\r\ndelay just because we're injured. Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThe three got ready quickly. They donned their space suits, loaded the\r\nlarger rocket plane with equipment, arms, and plenty of extra fuel. Just\r\nbefore they left, Lockhart gave them a word of caution. \"Do not attempt\r\nto communicate with the _Magellan_ by radio. If Pluto is the\r\nSun-tappers' home world, you may find yourselves surrounded by enemies,\r\nand overheard. Don't reveal our existence or position. If you have to\r\ntalk to us, do not expect a reply unless it's an absolute emergency.\"\r\n\r\nBurl strapped himself into his seat within the rocket plane and glanced\r\nthrough the thick window. Below them was a world the size of Earth--a\r\nworld which, if it had air and warmth, could most nearly be Earth's twin\r\nof all the planets in the system. This rocket plane had touched on the\r\nhot surface of Mercury, the first planet, In a little while it would set\r\ndown on the frigid surface of the last planet. They had come a long\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17. _Stronghold of the Lost Planet_\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a jolt that shoved the three men back in their seats, the rocket\r\nplane pushed out the cargo hatch, and slid into the dark of space on its\r\nown power. Behind them, the metallic surface of the _Magellan_ gleamed\r\nbriefly, and then swung away on its orbit. Riding the red fire of their\r\nrockets, they headed on a long low dive for the mysterious surface\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nPluto was a vast hemisphere, half lighted in the faint, dim glow of the\r\ntiny Sun, half in the total darkness of outer space. Here and there\r\nwound a silent, frozen river of glistening white. They passed over a\r\ngulf of some frigid sea of liquid gases, from which islands of subzero\r\nrock projected, and moved inland over a continent of lifeless grays and\r\nblacks. Haines gently drew the ship lower and lower, and at last the\r\nrocket plane bumped to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt rolled a few yards and stopped. The three men crowded to the door,\r\ntightened their face plates, and forced open the exit. There was a rush\r\nof air as the ship exhausted its atmosphere. Then, one by one, they\r\nstepped onto the bleak surface of the Sun's farthest planet.\r\n\r\n\"I feel peculiar,\" whispered Burl. \"This planet reminds me of\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the feeling I've been here before,\" Russ said slowly.\r\n\r\nBurl felt an odd chill. \"Yes, that's it!\"\r\n\r\nHaines grumbled. \"I know what you mean. I can make a guess. We've never\r\nreally been the right weight since we left Earth. Even under\r\nacceleration there were differences one way or the other. But I feel now\r\nexactly as I did on Earth. That's what gives you the odd sensation of\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nThe two younger men realized Haines was right. For the first time since\r\nthey had left their home world, they were on a planet whose gravity was\r\nnormal to them. It felt good and yet it felt--in these fearful\r\nsurroundings--disconcerting.\r\n\r\nAbove them was the familiar black, unyielding sky of outer space. No\r\nbreath of air moved. Yet somehow the scene resembled Earth. \"It's like a\r\nblack-and-white photo of a Terrestrial landscape,\" said Burl.\r\n\r\nThere was a field, some hills, a tiny frozen creek and the dark shapes\r\nof rounded mountains in the distance. All without color except for the\r\ncold, faint glow of the star that was the Sun.\r\n\r\nA thin layer of cosmic dust lay over the surface, such as would be found\r\non any airless world. Russ scooped beneath it and came up with a hard\r\nchip.\r\n\r\nHe squeezed it between his gauntleted fingers. It cracked and broke into\r\npowder. He whistled softly. \"You know what this feels and looks like?\"\r\nhe said as they came close to the frozen creek on the little hillside.\r\n\"It feels like dirt--common, Earthly dirt. Like soil. And you know\r\nwhat ... I can already tell you one of Pluto's secrets.\"\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the creek. It was a layer of frozen crystalline gases.\r\nHaines pushed the alpenstock he was carrying into it and scraped away\r\nthe gas crystals. \"I think I can guess,\" he said, \"and I'll bet there is\r\nice under this gas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pluto was once a warm world with a thick atmosphere,\" said\r\nRuss. \"Notice the rounded hills and the worn away peaks of the\r\nmountains. Those are old mountains--weather-beaten. This hill is\r\nround--weather-beaten. This creek, those rivers of frozen gas--they\r\nfollow beds that could only be made by real rivers of warm water. The\r\nsoil that lies beneath this dust--it could only happen on a world that\r\nknew night and day, warmth and light, and rain and wind. Pluto was once\r\na living world, a place we'd have called homelike.\"\r\n\r\nBurl shivered a bit. \"Out here? So far from the Sun? How and when?\"\r\n\r\nRuss shrugged. \"We'll find that out. But the evidence is unmistakable.\"\r\nThey walked on.\r\n\r\nThere was a low, cracked wall on the other side of the hill, and beyond\r\nthe wall stood the roofless ruins of a stone house, silent and gray in\r\nthe airless scene.\r\n\r\nThey waited with surprise and uncertainty. Haines drew his compressed\r\nair pistol, but there was no movement. The scene remained dead and\r\nstill--the windows of the house were dark.\r\n\r\nThey advanced on it and flashed a light inside. It was an empty shell.\r\nThere was no glass within the unusually wide and low window openings,\r\nand no door.\r\n\r\n\"They went in and out the windows,\" commented Burl, ducking through one\r\nof the openings. \"And they weren't built like us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Russ, \"there's no reason to suppose the inhabitants would\r\nhave been built like human beings.\"\r\n\r\nInside there was nothing to see, and they left. Beyond, they found a\r\nstraight depression in the ground filled with flat swirls of cosmic\r\ndust. \"This looks like a road,\" said Haines.\r\n\r\nThey returned to the rocket plane in order to follow the dead roadway\r\nmore easily. Passing between the low, dark cliffs of rocky mountains,\r\nthey came to a plain marked by thousands of columns of rock, pieces of\r\ncrumbling walls, and many straight depressions that must have been\r\nstreets. It was the remains of a world that had died.\r\n\r\nThey found, as they traveled northward and made intermittent landings,\r\nthat there had been many cities. Now all lay in ruins. There had been\r\ngreat roadways, now covered with the debris of outer space. There had\r\nbeen mighty forests, now miles of petrified black stumps. It was a\r\ngloomy sight.\r\n\r\nIn their landings, they had found inscriptions on walls and bas-reliefs\r\ncarved on mountains. They knew from these what the Plutonians had looked\r\nlike, and they had a suspicion of what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe Plutonians had been vaguely like men and vaguely like spiders. They\r\nhad stood upright on four thin, wide-spread legs and had two short arms.\r\nTheir bodies were wide and squat, and they seemed to have been mammalian\r\nand probably warm-blooded. They breathed air out of flat, thin nostrils\r\nand their heads joined their bodies without necks. Two oval eyes were\r\nset below a jutting bald brow. They had worn clothes, they had driven\r\nvehicles, they had flown planes.\r\n\r\nTheir vehicles had globe-shaped power plants. Their airplanes had globes\r\nwhere wings should have been. Their cities and their engines--which\r\nexisted now only on wall pictures that were probably once\r\nadvertisements--were built along globe-and-rod principles.\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt,\" said Russ, \"that the Sun-tapper culture and the\r\nPlutonian culture are the same. It's the descendants of the Plutonians\r\nthat we are fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could they have survived?\" Burl asked. \"This world was never\r\npart of the solar system when it was warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon know,\" said Russ. \"Tomorrow we're going to see how far we\r\ncan get into their polar redoubt. Somehow we've got to blow up that last\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I think we three are going to do it,\" said Haines. \"The _Magellan_\r\nwill never take the place from the sky. We'll have to do it from the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nNow they were reminded of Earth again. For the first time since they had\r\ndeparted from the United States, night fell. They had not been on any\r\nother planet long enough for such an experience. But the effect here on\r\nPluto was mild.\r\n\r\nDay was like a bright, moonlight night. Night then meant that the dim\r\nSun had set and, in effect, it merely made the landscape slightly\r\ndarker.\r\n\r\nThey compared notes late into the night in the rocket plane. By dawn,\r\nwhen again the dim glow shone, they had come to some very definite\r\nconclusions about the planet.\r\n\r\nA number of the drawings on the walls seemed to have some religious\r\nsignificance. They focused on the phases of a moon. There were symbolic\r\nrepresentations of this moon, passing through its phases; presumably\r\nPlutonian religious and social practices were related to it.\r\n\r\n\"But where is this moon?\" Burl had asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" Russ answered, \"that what some astronomers had suspected\r\nabout Pluto was right. It did not originate in the solar system, but was\r\ncaptured from outer space. Originally it revolved around another sun,\r\nsome star which was light-years away. How it tore loose from that star\r\nwe'll probably never know--the star might have simply become too dim,\r\ntheir planet might have been on a shaky orbit, an experiment of theirs\r\nmight have jarred it loose, many things could have happened.\r\n\r\n\"Once beyond the gravitational grip of its parent sun, the planet\r\nwandered through the darkness of interstellar space until it came within\r\nthe influence of our own Sun. How long this took would again be a guess.\r\nPossibly not more than a few thousand years, I'd say, since somehow a\r\nremnant of the population managed to survive. This suggests that they\r\nhad some warning. Enough time passed for them to build the big structure\r\nwe noticed at the north pole, probably to store food, build underground\r\ngreenhouses and make sealed homes for a few families. Inside this giant\r\nbuilding the last of the Plutonian people kept going.\r\n\r\n\"Then came the moment when their planet fell into an orbit around our\r\nSun. I'd guess they emerged to find that the new Sun was too far away\r\never to heat up Pluto again, or to permit the rebuilding of an\r\natmosphere. So they worked out a new scheme. This was to blow up the Sun\r\ninto a nova--make it a giant and thereby bring its heat all the way out\r\nto Pluto--warming this world again, lighting it again, unfreezing its\r\ngases and waters. So they set up the Sun-tap stations.\"\r\n\r\n\"That also accounts,\" added Haines, \"for their limited number of\r\nspaceships and their need for secret operations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Burl, \"but there are two things that don't fit in. What\r\nhappened to their moon--surely it would have gone along with Pluto since\r\nit revolved around it? And second, why the thirty-year delay between the\r\nfirst Sun-tap stations and the completion and operation of them?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to these questions yet. The three began the\r\nmorning's expedition.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the pole, they stayed close to the surface, for, any\r\nmoment, they expected to see the dumbbell ships that patrolled the sky\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nAt last they set down the rocket plane on the edge of the polar plateau\r\nand got out. Not more than a mile away, the black ramparts of the\r\nbuilding--a wall running miles across the horizon--rose hundreds of feet\r\ninto the sky.\r\n\r\nAbove it, they caught a flicker from the forest of masts and the glint\r\nfrom a dumbbell ship. They moved silently forward, carrying the rocket\r\nlauncher on their backs and a small load of shells and several hand\r\nbombs. These made heavy baggage, but the distance was not far, and the\r\npurpose great.\r\n\r\nBurl felt like an ant about to creep into a human house. But he\r\nreflected that no ant ever had such dangerous intentions. An ant enters\r\na house to steal a crumb of food. But if an ant had intelligence and\r\nevil intentions, it could cripple such a house.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation for the three of them as they neared the\r\nprecipitous walls. On arrival, they found that entry would be easier\r\nthan they expected.\r\n\r\nThe Plutonian refuge had not been built to offset attack from the\r\nsurface of the planet itself. It was no thick rampart of unbroken\r\nplastic as the walls of the other Sun-tap stations had been. Close up,\r\nit proved to have many doorless entryways, ramps running up to higher\r\nfloors, even wiry monorail scaffolding, probably left behind by the\r\nbuilders.\r\n\r\nThey entered an opening in the base. Once inside, dim lights set in the\r\nceiling lighted the path before them. They walked down this culvert like\r\nrats in a giant sewer until they came to a wall studded with several\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nThe doors were shut, but a tiny globe set on the surface of each one\r\nreacted to Burl's charged touch. Two opened upon dark airless passages.\r\nThe third resisted a moment, and when it did open, there was a whoosh of\r\nair which raised a momentary cloud of dust on the stone floor of the\r\nculvert. This was obviously the entrance to the inhabited portion of the\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nThe men closed the door behind them. They were in a small chamber. A\r\ndoor on the other side was opening automatically. \"An air lock system,\"\r\nmuttered Russ as they went through.\r\n\r\nThey were now inside the vast building itself. There was air, and, after\r\ntesting it, they opened their helmets. The air was almost as thick as\r\nthat of Earth, and they experienced no difficulty in breathing. It was\r\nstale and somewhat metallic in flavor, probably because it had been\r\nenclosed and used over and over for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThey saw no living beings, which seemed strange. \"Apparently these\r\npeople really are at their last gasp,\" remarked Russ as they passed\r\nthrough an area that had obviously once been a large dormitory. They\r\nheard distant humming sounds somewhere in the floors above, but all that\r\nwas visible on the lower level seemed to be maintenance machinery.\r\n\r\nThey walked through great storerooms which were piled high with sealed\r\ndrums. They saw factories lying silent--curious lofts of odd machines\r\npowered by globes that were idle. They skirted an unlighted reservoir of\r\nwater in a circular chamber far in the interior. And here and there in\r\nthe gloom, they spotted huge ramps leading spirally upward.\r\n\r\nFinally they turned their steps up a sloping ramp, mounting one floor\r\nand then another, and another. They were tired, but curiously\r\nexhilarated. They felt that they were about to strike at the heart of\r\nthe foe, and that his days were numbered at last.\r\n\r\nThey emerged on a higher level, lighted more brightly than the others.\r\nHere they saw globes that glowed with the same intensity as those in\r\nthe Sun-tap stations had. They moved carefully now, keeping out of\r\nsight, and several times they saw shadows in the distance or heard the\r\nthump of something moving.\r\n\r\nThey worked their way by instinct to what they guessed was the center of\r\noperations. They peered, at last, through a low, wide doorway into a\r\nlarge chamber. Here was a mass of mighty globes and rods, some revolving\r\nas they circled the metal masts that came through the room from the\r\nceiling above.\r\n\r\n\"It must be the base of the Sun-tap receiver line,\" whispered Haines.\r\n\"This should be a good enough place to set up our time bomb.\"\r\n\r\nThey stole over to a cluster of globes and unpacked the powerful little\r\natomic bomb they had carried with them. They carefully put it together,\r\ninserted the explosive fuse, and set the timer. \"I'm giving it four\r\nhours,\" said Haines. \"Time for us to get out of here and radio the\r\n_Magellan_ to get into action. That should take care of this station.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved carefully out again, scarcely breathing for fear of some\r\nPlutonian entering and discovering them. They made their exit safely\r\nenough and started to retrace their steps.\r\n\r\nBack down through corridors and strange chambers they moved, stopping\r\nevery little while as something that sounded like footsteps passed over\r\nthem. \"Where,\" Burl whispered, suddenly troubled, \"is the stolen heat\r\nand power of the Sun going? It isn't heating up Pluto. Surely they can't\r\nsimply store it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something we haven't solved,\" Russ replied hurriedly. \"From what I\r\nremember of the masts, it looked as if they were relaying it somewhere\r\nelse again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't imagine where,\" said Haines. \"Not back into space, surely?\"\r\n\r\nThey fell silent, concentrating all their energies on not losing the\r\nway. \"Are you sure we came through here?\" Burl asked nervously. \"I don't\r\nremember this at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't, either,\" said Russ. \"It looks queer. Are you sure we're on the\r\nright path?\" He turned to Haines.\r\n\r\nThe explorer shook his head. \"We must have made a wrong turn. I think\r\nwe've lost our direction.\"\r\n\r\nThey hastily conferred, and decided the best thing to do was to make\r\ntheir way to the lowest level and then outward--but suddenly they\r\nrealized they could not tell which way was outward. There were no\r\nwindows, and the wall markings and direction signs were unintelligible.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, they heard new noises, and, just as they dodged\r\ninto a corner, five Plutonians shambled through.\r\n\r\nThese creatures were as the ancient wall sculptures had depicted them,\r\nthough a bit smaller than their ancestors. They were pale, almost white\r\nin skin color, and their eyes were tiny sparks of red. They wore light\r\nharnesses around their bodies, and two of them were carrying tools. They\r\nspoke together in clacking bass voices. They shuffled loosely over the\r\nground on their four thin legs. Burl thought of them as ugly caricatures\r\nof semi-humans.\r\n\r\nWhen the creatures had passed, the three explorers darted out to where a\r\nramp spiraled to the lower levels. They started down in single file, but\r\nit was too late.\r\n\r\nStaring directly at them were two Plutonians who had come up from below.\r\nThe men pushed past, but not before a barking voice had cracked out an\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe Earthmen started to run down, followed by the scrabbling sounds of\r\ntheir pursuers. The barking calls increased in volume.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere a booming sound began, repeated over and over. As the men\r\nemerged on the floor below, they heard it repeated on every level. \"The\r\nalarm's out for us,\" called Haines, making no effort to keep his voice\r\ndown. \"We've got to run for it!\"\r\n\r\nLaden with the remaining weapons and equipment, the three human beings\r\nhurried on, but it soon became clear that four legs were better than\r\ntwo, for the creatures were gaining on them.\r\n\r\nThey had forgotten they were lost. Now they sought only to get out of\r\nsight and hide. They dropped their equipment as they ran, down halls,\r\nthrough tunnels, skittering along sloping ramps, heading for what they\r\nhoped would prove to be an exit.\r\n\r\nBehind them an increasing crowd of Plutonians had collected, and\r\nseveral times a spark of electronic power crackled and blazed against\r\nthe wall over their heads. The pursuers were armed.\r\n\r\nBurl's lungs began to ache painfully. Close on the heels of his\r\ncompanions he dashed into one room only to find a group of Plutonians\r\ncoming at him from the other side. His ears were deafened by the barking\r\nnoises and alarm boomings. He jumped to one side to avoid a Plutonian\r\nstanding directly in his path, and ran into a narrow tunnel. There was\r\nan excited barking as the creatures followed him.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking heart, he realized that he was now alone. Haines and Russ\r\nmust have been cut off. He gasped for breath. Running in a tight space\r\nsuit, carrying his oxygen tanks, was hot and hard work. He did not dare\r\ndrop the tanks, for his only chance was to escape outside.\r\n\r\nHe ran wildly on, hoping to reach an outer door. But he seemed now to be\r\nin a maze, for nothing was familiar to him. He could no longer remember\r\nhow many times he had run into groups of Plutonians, nor could he guess\r\nhow many followed on his heels.\r\n\r\nThen he stumbled into a small, round chamber out of which led three\r\ntunnels. As he looked around quickly to select his next means of escape,\r\nbarking Plutonians erupted from each opening. Burl backed up against the\r\nwall, knowing that this time he was trapped.\r\n\r\nA blaze of sparks broke over his head as a blast banged across the\r\nroom. The red-eyed, scrabbling figures charged, their chinless mouths\r\nopening to emit barking calls of bestial anger. One aimed a rodlike\r\ncontrivance at him, and there was another flare of light.\r\n\r\nThe room dissolved around him in a glare of brilliant green. As he\r\nslipped helplessly to the floor, he lost consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18. _Sacrifice on the Sacred Moon_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Burl Denning! Can you hear me, Burl Denning?\" A thin, tinny voice\r\nsomewhere was calling him. But the darkness was all around, and Burl\r\nfelt a great sleepiness and a desire only to sink deeper into the\r\ncottony nothing in which he seemed to be cradled.\r\n\r\n\"Burl Denning! If you can hear me, speak up!\" Again the faint, scratchy\r\nvoice nagged at Burl's mind. He really ought to answer. He tried to open\r\nhis mouth. Something hard and cold was pressing against his back. He\r\ntossed and squirmed.\r\n\r\nOnce more the voice called, and this time he decided that he must be\r\nasleep. He struggled to open his eyes, then finally blinked them wide in\r\nan effort to adjust himself to his surroundings.\r\n\r\nHe was apparently out in the open, and it was night. The sky was dark,\r\nnot black, but almost so--a deep, blue-black. There was a pale blue\r\nsaucer hanging in the sky. It blotted out most of the view. Gradually,\r\nhe became aware of a shiny barrier between him and that sky--he was not\r\nout of doors. Something like a glass dome seemed to be overhead.\r\n\r\nBurl raised his head. There was no one in sight. He felt dizzy and\r\nconfused. He lifted a hand to his brow, and felt the cold glass of his\r\nspace helmet. He was still wearing his space suit then. The voice--it\r\nmust be in his helmet phone.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" he ventured weakly. \"Who's calling?\"\r\n\r\nQuickly the faint voice replied, growing stronger. \"Burl, are you all\r\nright? Where are you?\"\r\n\r\nBurl looked around. He was sitting on the floor of an isolated enclosure\r\nwith a transparent dome. There were no walls, just the rounded dome like\r\na fishbowl turned upside down on him. The flooring beneath his feet was\r\nplastic.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, I think,\" said Burl. \"Is that you, Russ? Sounds a little\r\nlike you, but you must be far away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's me, Russell Clyde,\" confirmed the voice. \"You're coming in\r\nweak, too. Where are you?\"\r\n\r\nBurl described his surroundings. There was a silence for a moment, then\r\nRuss's voice again. \"I kind of suspected it, but what you say confirms\r\nit. We must be on the only planet we haven't visited ... or rather, not\r\non it, but near it. I mean Neptune. I knew from the gravity I wasn't on\r\nPluto any more. Judging from our weight, and your description of the\r\nbluish planet in the sky, we must be on Triton, Neptune's bigger moon.\"\r\n\r\nBurl found that his dizziness was disappearing. \"I feel light,\" he\r\ncommented, as he got to his feet. \"Should Neptune look sort of like\r\nUranus, only more bluish in color?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said Russ. \"Neptune is pretty much of a twin for Uranus,\r\nonly it's denser, a little bit smaller, and perhaps more substantial\r\nthan the other giant worlds in our system. It should have a second moon,\r\nsmaller and way out.\"\r\n\r\nBurl walked around the little enclosed space. \"I guess I'm a prisoner\r\nhere,\" he said. \"This dome is on the surface. Most of the area is just a\r\nsort of rocky plain with patches of liquid gases, but there are a couple\r\nof big buildings nearby. Funny sort of structures--they have fancy tops\r\nwith symbols on them that look like the phases of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'm inside one of those buildings,\" Russ guessed. \"I'm in a big\r\nhall with a lot of exhibits in glass cases. And they've got the\r\nstrangest creatures I've ever seen in them. There are lunar markings\r\nhere, too--they remind me of the ones we saw on Pluto. You know what I\r\nsuspect?\"\r\n\r\nBurl paced around, regaining his senses as he walked. It was obvious\r\nthat, after he'd been knocked out by the Plutonians, he had been taken\r\nby them to this moon of Neptune. For what purpose?\r\n\r\nRuss continued to murmur his thoughts, his voice ringing tinnily in\r\nBurl's earphones. \"I think that Triton was originally Pluto's moon. When\r\nPluto wandered into the solar system, it crossed Neptune's orbit and was\r\nheld. Its moon came closer to Neptune and was captured completely. But\r\nPluto, having a greater mass, didn't stick. It established an eccentric\r\norbit of its own which took it far out from Neptune for hundreds of\r\nyears at a stretch and brought it back only rarely. Pluto lost its moon.\r\nAnd that moon was the spiritual home of the Sun-tappers' religion.\"\r\n\r\nBurl glanced across the landscape. There were some funny things growing\r\nnearby. They looked a little like thin, glassy trees with big, blue\r\ncoconuts on top.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to you and Haines after we got separated?\" he asked,\r\nstill talking through his helmet phone.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what happened to Haines,\" said Russ. \"I hope he got away.\r\nBut they trapped me. I was taken aboard one of their dumbbell ships, and\r\nbrought here. The trip took days. I guess you were unconscious for all\r\nthat time. If it's any comfort to you, the Pluto building was destroyed.\r\nOur atomic bomb went off. I saw the flare from a window in the ship. I\r\nthink this moon is the last stronghold of the Sun-tappers, and I think\r\nit is our final objective.\"\r\n\r\nThe strange crystalline vegetation seemed to be moving closer to Burl.\r\nHe watched it carefully. It _was_ moving! There were living beings out\r\nthere!\r\n\r\nThey glided oddly over the ground, and he saw that their bases were a\r\nmass of crystalline fringes, moving feelers which crawled over the\r\nsurface bearing the upper structures with them. They had thin, trunklike\r\nbodies with two long, pencil-like branches that were used as arms. And\r\nthe coconut objects were heads!\r\n\r\nThey circled the dome now, and Burl could see that each round blue knob\r\nhad a central black spot that apparently served as an eye. There was no\r\nsign of nostrils or mouth. Burl stared at the creatures in wonder.\r\n\r\nThe beings were clearly gesturing to him, trying to signal with their\r\nodd arms. He waved back, wondering how he could establish communication.\r\nAs he did so, he described the creatures to Russ.\r\n\r\nRuss's voice was excited. \"Say! I think I've figured out what sort of\r\nplace I'm in. This is a museum of galactic life! Each of these glass\r\ncases contains a specimen of the highest form of life of its particular\r\nworld. In one of the cases, opposite me, there's one of the Martian\r\ncreatures--a big, antlike fellow. He's standing there, looking perfectly\r\nalive, but absolutely motionless. Next to him is something else that\r\nlooks like an intelligent form. It's sort of a man, covered with short\r\nred hair. Around its waist it's got a belt, and there are pouches on it,\r\nand something like a short sword. It must be a humanoid type from some\r\nworld out among the stars. Some of the others look like intelligent\r\nforms, too, because they are wearing clothing.\r\n\r\n\"I think that collecting these specimens and setting them up here is\r\npart of the religion of the Sun-tappers.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Russ was talking, Burl thought of a way he might communicate with\r\nthe stick-men. He wanted to draw a diagram of the solar system on the\r\nfloor of his enclosure. He gestured futilely with his hand, but there\r\nwas nothing with which to make a marking. The stick-men outside watched\r\nhis hand, then one of them reached around to something hanging across\r\nits back and withdrew a thin tablet and a wedge of red. Holding the\r\ntablet up so that Burl could see, the creature quickly sketched a\r\nrecognizable map of the Sun and its planets!\r\n\r\nBurl realized then that he was dealing with highly intelligent\r\nbeings--no savages, these, but the products of a high civilization. He\r\nindicated the third world as his own. The stick-man drew back as if\r\nsurprised, then pointed upward.\r\n\r\nThey came from Neptune!\r\n\r\nDuring the next few hours, a most curious three-way discussion went\r\non--Burl signaling to the Neptunians outside and describing his\r\ndiscoveries to Russ over the phone of his space suit; Russ suggesting\r\nanswers to some of the more difficult diagrams. It was a curious\r\nexperience. Gradually, by means of simple drawings and gestures, and\r\neven charadelike playlets acted out by the weird vegetable-crystal\r\nbeings, there emerged the general story of the Neptunians and the\r\ninvaders from Pluto.\r\n\r\nOn Neptune there had been a great civilization covering the entire\r\nworld, a hard surface lying deep beneath its thick methane atmosphere.\r\nThere were forests and there were animals and intelligent beings. They\r\ndid not breathe, but absorbed both their food and liquid gas through\r\nrootlike feelers on which they stood and moved.\r\n\r\nThen one day, about thirty years ago, they had been invaded by creatures\r\nthat came in dumbbell-shaped spaceships, and which had destroyed their\r\ncities, and attempted to conquer the planet. They learned that these\r\nships had come from Triton, the strange new moon that Neptune had\r\nacquired about a thousand years earlier, and from the new planet, Pluto,\r\ntheir astronomers had observed at that time.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the Neptunians had fought against the invaders. For a\r\nwhile they almost succeeded, but then something new had developed. Their\r\nworld grew hotter. Great structures had been erected on the poles, the\r\nareas first conquered by the Plutonians and still held by them. From\r\nthese spots, vast amounts of heat surged over the planet and changed it.\r\n\r\nHeat meant death and doom to every living frigi-plasmic thing on\r\nNeptune. Desperately, they increased their warfare, but the heat sapped\r\ntheir strength, destroying them, until now they knew it was but a matter\r\nof time before the Neptunians, beast and vegetable alike, would vanish\r\ntotally.\r\n\r\n\"So that's it,\" breathed Burl. \"That's where the Sun-tap energy is\r\ngoing. The Plutonians want Neptune because it's near their old moon, and\r\nthey have to warm it up to live on it. Of course! And Neptune's too far\r\nfrom the Sun to explode when it novas, it will just get comfortable for\r\nthe Plutonians!\"\r\n\r\nThe Neptunians continued their strange tale. They had built a crude\r\nspaceship and manned it with a suicide battalion of the most desperate\r\nwarriors of their race. They had journeyed to Triton in hopes of seizing\r\nit and destroying the foe from there. The stick-men had attacked and had\r\nbeen beaten back.\r\n\r\nNow there were only a few dozen of them left--the last soldiers of their\r\ninvasion and ignored by the enemy. And here they were, explaining this\r\nto Burl whom they recognized as an ally.\r\n\r\nRuss's voice suddenly broke into Burl's thoughts, \"There's some sort of\r\nceremony beginning here. There's a procession of Plutonians dressed in\r\ngolden robes marching down the center of the hall, carrying staffs with\r\nmoon pictures on them.... They're chanting in unison, though it sounds\r\nlike barking. Can you hear it?\"\r\n\r\nBurl could. It sounded faintly in his earphones like the noises in a dog\r\npound.\r\n\r\n\"Now they're circling around. They're opening one of the cases. The\r\nglass slides back.... Say! The exhibits aren't dead. I see something\r\nmoving.... It's a man!\"\r\n\r\nRuss's voice stopped suddenly. Faintly, Burl could hear the barking and\r\nthen Russ's terrified voice. \"It is a man, Burl. He's dark-skinned and\r\nwearing white cotton pants and a homespun shirt. He looks like an\r\nIndian, maybe a South American Indian. When they lifted the glass, he\r\njust walked out and stood as if he were all mixed up. Then he got scared\r\nand started to run.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was silent a moment. \"They grabbed him, Burl. They\r\n_sacrificed_ him! And now they're coming for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop them!\" Burl yelled wildly. \"Do something!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't stop them.\" Russ was resigned. \"They're taking me to the empty\r\nglass case. I guess I'm elected to be the next exhibit. They're shoving\r\nme in!\"\r\n\r\nOutside Burl's enclosure the stick-men sensed something unusual in his\r\nstrained attitude. They stared in at him, while he remained tense,\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nNow Russ's voice came again. \"They're going to take off my helmet and\r\nthrow in the suspended animation gas, Burl. Good-by. I can see them\r\nstill. Oh ... oh, I feel strange, I feel stiff, faint ... here ... I ...\r\ngo....\"\r\n\r\nHis voice faded out, thin and weak. Then there was only silence.\r\n\r\nBurl threw himself against the restraining transparent wall of his dome\r\nprison and hammered on it with his fists. The dome would not give way.\r\n\r\nHe looked around desperately, determined to escape, wondering what\r\nsurprise the Plutonians were holding him for--suspecting he would be the\r\nnext victim. They would be coming for him soon, he knew.\r\n\r\nHe searched the enclosure for some way of leaving. He looked at the\r\nstick-men and wondered if they knew. One of them, the one who seemed to\r\nbe the leader, gestured to him. His arm pointed to a spot in the floor.\r\n\r\nSure enough, there was a crack there, an outline like a small trap\r\ncover. He worked at it with his fingers and, finding a dent, he pushed.\r\nA lid came off. Below was a cleared space, a few inches deep, in which\r\nwere set the levers of a typical Plutonian control board.\r\n\r\nBurl wondered if he were still carrying the charge that attuned him to\r\nsuch controls. The shock he had received on Pluto could have blanked it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHe pushed at the levers with his gloved hands. They did not obey him.\r\nDesperately, he removed the glove from one of his hands. It was bitter\r\ncold in the little enclosure, but there was some atmosphere. The lever\r\nalmost froze to his fingers, but he turned it again.\r\n\r\nThis time it worked. The top of the dome that entrapped him suddenly\r\nopened, and the sides slid back. Burl replaced his glove on his hand and\r\ndashed outside to the freedom of the frigid surface of Triton.\r\n\r\nThen he was among the Neptunian stick-men, and they were actually\r\npatting him on the back, waving toward the building, hurrying him on.\r\n\r\nThey were prepared to die in one last desperate assault on the foe.\r\nCould Burl do less?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19. _The Museum of Galactic Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a number of structures laid out on the plain under the blue\r\nglow of Neptune. Burl saw that only one of them was a true building in\r\nthe design he had come to know was that of an ancient Plutonian temple\r\nexcept that it was far, far larger than any of the ruined shells he had\r\nseen on Pluto.\r\n\r\nThe other structures turned out to be walls and pillars arranged around\r\nthe central building, evidently in relation to their religious\r\nsignificance. This main building, ornately decorated, was windowless,\r\nand the several closed doors represented metallic and forbidding\r\nbarriers. It must have covered thirty acres, rising about thirty feet\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nAs Burl frantically examined it, the leaders of the Neptunians moved\r\ndiscreetly with him. They gestured at the doors, indicating their own\r\ninability to open them. Apparently they thought that Burl might succeed\r\nwhere they had failed.\r\n\r\nBurl wasn't sure he could. He supposed there might be controls similar\r\nto those that released him from the dome, but he thought first he had\r\nbetter determine a plan of action. Somewhere within, Russ was sealed\r\nup--an exhibit among the living dead of many planets.\r\n\r\nHe managed to convey this thought to the three stick-men. There was an\r\nunmistakable nod of assent from one of them, and a twiglike arm\r\nindicated that Burl should follow him. They rapidly crossed the area to\r\nthe outlying fringes of a frigi-plasmic forest.\r\n\r\nHere towering crystalline masses pushed up from the dark ground. It\r\nseemed to be a weird jumble of broken glass--broken glass ten and\r\nfifteen feet high! The Neptunians led Burl into this amazing landscape\r\nthrough a narrow path. He walked behind them, feeling thick and heavy in\r\ncomparison with their fragile bodies. But, in spite of appearances, they\r\nwere not fragile, nor were the growths that made up the fantastic\r\nNeptune-transplanted vegetation of Triton.\r\n\r\nThey came to a clearing amid the forest of blue and green and orange\r\ncrystals, and there were the rest of the Neptunian survivors. Burl\r\ncounted about forty, rooted in pools of liquid gas, absorbing renewed\r\nenergy while waiting for commands. As he entered the clearing, most of\r\nthem lifted their root tentacles and crowded around him. He was as\r\nstrange a being to them--helmeted and bundled in plastic and rubber and\r\nmetal--as they seemed to him.\r\n\r\nBurl noticed that many of them must have been wounded--there were signs\r\nof missing arms or of burned roots, and a few had odd poultices smeared\r\nover their round, blue heads.\r\n\r\nThe Neptunian commander pointed out their store of arms. They had long\r\nspears of some glistening translucent substance, a projector which fired\r\ndarts of the same material, and a number of the Plutonian globe-and-rod\r\ninstruments--obviously captured from the enemy.\r\n\r\nHe examined some of the spears and darts, and a suspicion he had held on\r\nfirst seeing them was confirmed. These were made of ice! On Neptune, ice\r\nwas easily obtained--and hard enough to be worked like metal. Its\r\nmelting point being far, far above any heat likely outside of a\r\nNeptunian laboratory, it was as permanent as iron for their needs!\r\n\r\nBurl studied the captured Plutonian hand weapons, and was pleased to\r\nhave one of the Neptunian soldiers pick up one and demonstrate how it\r\nwas fired. It had apparently simpler controls than most Plutonian\r\nproducts, for it easily blazed forth a bolt of electronic fire that\r\nblasted a tall, crystalline tree to shards.\r\n\r\nThe Neptunian leader began to gesture again, and conveyed to Burl that\r\nthey wanted to attack as soon as possible. He gathered that conditions\r\non Triton were not the best for these people--that their ability to hold\r\nout was limited and that they desired to make their final assault\r\nwithout delay. They wanted to know now what Burl could contribute.\r\n\r\nBurl realized that as far as he was concerned, he was not in any better\r\nshape than his allies. His oxygen tanks were slowly but surely emptying.\r\nHe examined his gauges and was startled to see he had only two more\r\nhours before suffocation would set in. The suit was warmed by batteries\r\nwhich would last several days longer, but by that time it would be too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nSomewhere inside his suit he had a pocket knife, but he could not get at\r\nit in the frigid near-airlessness of the outer surface. His holster\r\nstill hung at his side, but it was empty.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do then but to join the Neptunian assault. He would\r\ntry to open the door by the electronic charge that still remained in his\r\nbody. If he did, they could break in and do what they could. If he could\r\nnot, who knew what would happen?\r\n\r\nBurl picked up one of the Plutonian weapons and gestured to the rest to\r\nprepare to attack. Immediately, they fell into orderly ranks. They were,\r\nindeed, soldiers, Burl thought--the cream of their planet's\r\narmies--whatever that meant in Terrestrial terms.\r\n\r\nThen, following the lead of the Neptunian captain, they marched out of\r\nthe forest. As they crossed the open plain, Burl knew that they were\r\nprobably in sight of the defenders. But he realized quickly that that\r\nhad been true when he was released and nothing had happened. So perhaps\r\nhe was wrong. Perhaps the Plutonians were limited--perhaps they had not\r\nbothered to keep a watch.\r\n\r\nThat left only the Plutonian spaceships to worry about. Burl hastily\r\nsearched the sky and located two glowing spots--four really--undoubtedly\r\ntwo of the double-sphere ships. The Neptunians behind bumped into him,\r\nthen the whole column came to a halt.\r\n\r\nBurl pointed to the ships. The commander waved his arms helplessly. They\r\nhad been there all along, Burl gathered, and what could he do about it?\r\nMore gestures. Yes, the ships were dangerous. In fact, they had been the\r\nones that had defeated the main Neptunian attack, blasted them from the\r\nsky and destroyed the ship in which the stick-man army had arrived. The\r\nNeptunians were going to attack, regardless.\r\n\r\nAgain, Burl realized the essentially suicidal mood that moved these\r\nbeings. They were attacking against odds before which they were utterly\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\nEven as Burl stared at the far-off lights of the Plutonian ships, he\r\nnoticed them swing away, moving off toward the horizon. As he watched,\r\nhe thought for an instant that something else had blinked like a star,\r\nfar in the distance.\r\n\r\nStruck by a sudden thought, he activated his helmet radio. \"Burl Denning\r\ncalling the _Magellan_! He spoke at maximum power into his throat mike.\r\nCalling the _Magellan_! If you can hear me, reply!\"\r\n\r\nThen, to his joy, a faint, far-away voice answered, \"Burl Denning! This\r\nis Lockhart. Give us your location.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lockhart! There are two Pluto ships approaching you from the direction\r\nin which you can hear my voice. Be careful!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice came faintly again, \"We see them. We'll take care of them.\r\nHaines made it back to the ship. The Pluto base is destroyed. There are\r\nonly those two ships left. We followed them here as fast as we could.\r\nCan you hold out until we draw them out and crack them? We will need a\r\nlittle time.\"\r\n\r\nBurl called, \"Don't worry about me. Go to it. Russ may be alive in their\r\nbuilding here. Don't bomb it. I'm going to try to get in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" called Lockhart's voice, already growing weak as the _Magellan_\r\nand the two pursuing foes drew away.\r\n\r\nBurl turned to the Neptunian captain. He drew his hand across the sky to\r\nshow that the ships had gone, drawn away from their protection of the\r\ntemple. He pointed at the walls of the building with a \"let's go\"\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\nBurl noticed that though the Neptunians were apparently featureless, he\r\ncould sense a distinct tightening up in their actions. They were tensed,\r\nready for the final battle.\r\n\r\nThey marched up to the main door of the temple. The captain loosed a\r\nbolt of electronic fire at it, but it left no mark.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound from within. Evidently the Plutonians were either\r\nbusy about their own business, or did not regard the Neptunians as worth\r\ntheir attention.\r\n\r\nIn a covered panel right next to the door, Burl found the typical\r\nSun-tap controls. He tried to work them, but they would not function\r\nthrough his gloves.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, knowing that removing his glove this time might prove very\r\nrisky. Then he hastily drew off his left gauntlet and the thin nylon\r\nglove that was the inner protection of his suit. He placed his hand on\r\nthe control. The icy cold bit into it. He twisted, the control worked,\r\nand he tore his hand away, replacing the gloves.\r\n\r\nThe door slid open. Burl ran inside, followed by half a dozen\r\nNeptunians. They were in a small antechamber, evidently an air lock.\r\n\r\nThe Neptunians, leaping with excitement, did not bother to activate the\r\ninner door, which would have meant closing the outer door. Instead, they\r\nattacked it with heavy ice axes. The strange tools, chilled to a\r\nhardness unthinkable on Earth, bit into the fragile plastic.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hard blows, the plastic split, and there was a small\r\nexplosion as the air within the temple burst through. A gale of escaping\r\ngases roared through the little chamber, ripping the rest of the door to\r\nshards and hurling the Neptunians right and left. Outside, the flow\r\nbegan to congeal, and a thin snow of liquid air began to fall.\r\n\r\nWhen the blast subsided after several minutes, the Neptunians jumped up,\r\nshook off the new gas-snow, and charged through the doorway into the\r\ntemple itself.\r\n\r\nBurl held his Plutonian flashgun at the ready. Inside, they found chaos\r\nand disaster. In the great rooms and halls Plutonians writhed on the\r\nfloors, in the last throes of suffocation and freezing, now that the air\r\nhad been ripped from their stronghold.\r\n\r\nThe walls bore brilliant paintings and sharply defined sculptures.\r\nAdvancing with the ranks of stick-men, Burl caught glimpses of strange\r\nscenes on distant planets, of landscapes that must have been Pluto at\r\none time, beneath a double sun that probably was its original parent.\r\n\r\nBurl became faintly aware of a distant clanging. Not all the air was\r\ngone, he thought; it must be pouring out in slower volume as the\r\npressure diminished. Somewhere an alarm was ringing.\r\n\r\nThe Neptunians fell behind; he saw now that the floor and walls of the\r\ntemple were still too hot for them. They began to withdraw, regrouping,\r\nblazing away with ice darts and spears at Plutonians who had appeared in\r\nhastily-donned space garments.\r\n\r\nBurl fired, then plunged on. He had to get to the hall where Russ was\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nFinally he was out of sight and sound of the Neptunians and their\r\nadversaries. Behind him a door swung down. He was nearing the heart of\r\nthe building now. The remaining Plutonians were sealing it off, rallying\r\nfor their final defense.\r\n\r\nHe was now cut off from support. But he still counted on confusion and\r\nsurprise to aid him. He ran down a long hall to a vast central chamber\r\nand arrived a split second before the door slammed shut after him. The\r\nmuseum of galactic life!\r\n\r\nIt was a huge hall, oval in shape. In its center was a block that might\r\nbe an altar. Lining the walls on each side, ranging from the great door\r\non the far end to the equally ornate one through which Burl had come,\r\nwere floor-to-ceiling niches with gently curved, transparent fronts. He\r\ncould see dark shapes standing motionless within each of these\r\nexhibition cases.\r\n\r\nThere were also about two dozen Plutonians in the hall, most of them\r\ngrouped around the central altar. They wore gaudy harnesses and carried\r\nsharp, swordlike wands.\r\n\r\nTwo of them started for Burl, and he leveled his weapon and fired. There\r\nwas a flash of light and one of the creatures dropped senseless. The\r\nother turned and scuttled away, uttering barking cries.\r\n\r\nBurl glanced hastily around. The rest of the Plutonians--priests or\r\ncurators or executioners, whatever they were--advanced slowly on Burl.\r\nHe couldn't get them all, but he'd try. He fired it again.\r\n\r\nThis time the weapon failed to go off. Its charge was used up. The\r\nPlutonians yelped with delight and pressed forward, flourishing their\r\nswords.\r\n\r\nBurl desperately hurled a globe-and-rod at them, meanwhile looking\r\naround for a new weapon, But he saw only the shining glass fronts of the\r\nexhibits. In the nearest case was a manlike being, dark purple in color,\r\na thing with a fixed but intelligent stare in its slanted yellow eyes.\r\nIt had two tall ears, a wide chest, and a curling tail, and was wearing\r\na belt with pouches and a short kilt that only about half covered his\r\ntwo long, hairy legs.\r\n\r\nBurl spun on his heel, swooped upon the gleaming swordlike wand that had\r\nfallen from the dead Plutonian, and racing back to the exhibit, brought\r\nit up with all his might against the transparent surface.\r\n\r\nThe glassy stuff cracked. Another blow with all the strength of an\r\nEarth-muscled body on a light gravity world, and the front shattered\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThere was a puff of a greenish gas. The creature inside suddenly blinked\r\nand moved a hand. Then, without waiting, Burl dashed to the next exhibit\r\nand swung his metal sword again.\r\n\r\nThe barking calls of the Plutonians increased in frenzy, and they\r\ncharged him, screaming. As the second exhibit crashed open, Burl turned\r\nto fend off his attackers, swinging his sword. It clashed against the\r\nsword of the nearest curator-priest, who slipped and went bowling over\r\nagainst his fellows. Burl reached the third exhibit and smashed it.\r\n\r\nHe turned to meet a renewed attack, and this time, out of the corner of\r\nhis eye, he saw that a purple humanoid was in action beside him. The\r\npurple one had picked up a Plutonian, apparently with great ease, and\r\nwas using its body as a bludgeon.\r\n\r\nSomething furry and green leaped high in the air and came down in the\r\nmiddle of the Plutonians. There was a wild, unearthly screech as it\r\nlanded, and exhibit number two, from heaven knew what starry world, was\r\nin the fray.\r\n\r\nNow Burl found himself momentarily unhampered, and rapidly he opened\r\nexhibit after exhibit. The battle became wilder and fiercer, as\r\nstar-being after star-being joined in.\r\n\r\nThe Plutonians swung away in all directions with their wands. Their\r\nbarking voices were drowned out by a rising chorus of sounds--roaring,\r\ninhuman voices, calling curses in languages of worlds that lay many\r\nlight-years distant--wild, birdlike calls from a winged being whose\r\nintelligent eyes and wide brow belied the ferocity of its beaked and\r\ntaloned attack. There was a clanking, ringing sound, as a thing of half\r\njointed shining metal, half soft, velvety-white flesh, whirred among the\r\nfoe, doing damage with a razor-edged arm that shot out from the metallic\r\npart of its body.\r\n\r\nThere was something like a cloud of insects--a mad thing which seemed to\r\nbe a single hive of tiny winged cells that moved and bit and stood its\r\nground like a single united being.\r\n\r\nThere was a Martian that had at first stood stupidly, as if unaware of\r\nwhat was going on, and then had gone berserk at the first sight of a\r\nPlutonian running past him.\r\n\r\nAnd in the next case was Russ, still space-suited, staring out through\r\nthe glass. With a joyous crash, Burl smashed the front of the niche.\r\n\r\nRuss moved, his eyes opening wide as he saw Burl. He reached down\r\nquickly and picked up the helmet which had been taken from his head. As\r\nsoon as he had it in place, he activated the phones. \"Wow!\" his voice\r\ncame in Burl's earphones loud and clear, \"Let's go!\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped down and grabbed Burl. Together, the two danced a wild jig of\r\njoy. Then they both remembered the Plutonians and turned, realizing that\r\nthey had momentarily left themselves wide open to attack.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing to be afraid of. The Plutonians were all torn,\r\nbeaten, lifeless. Moving among them were their former victims--the\r\nexhibits gathered from worlds undreamed of by human astronomers. What\r\nhopes of vengeance had been stored in those inhuman hearts when each had\r\nbeen torn from his native world, had been caught in helpless paralysis\r\nand carried trillions of miles across trackless space as living\r\ntrophies!\r\n\r\nAlthough their forms were many and strange, there seemed to be no fear\r\nof one another among the survivors. What they had been through had\r\nunited them forever. One by one, they began to gather around Burl and\r\nRuss, recognizing in them their saviors, grateful for their delivery.\r\n\r\nBurl's helmet radio spoke up. \"The _Magellan_ calling Burl Denning! We\r\nhave eliminated the last two enemy ships. Give us your location. We\r\nintend to A-bomb the installations on Triton as soon as we can pick you\r\nup!\"\r\n\r\nBurl spoke into the phone. \"Hold up the explosions, colonel. We've taken\r\nthe place intact. You can land the _Magellan_ outside the main temple\r\nand come and see. We've got allies, lots of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Russ into his phone, \"we've got the secret of Pluto, we've\r\ngot a friendly, fellow world on Neptune, and we have a whole crowd of\r\nthe strangest refugees you'll ever hope to see. Bring extra space suits\r\nwith you. We have the makings here of friendship and trade with dozens\r\nof distant star planets--a treasure in itself worth a dozen trips around\r\nthe solar system.\"\r\n\r\nBurl looked around him, thoughtful at these words. Visions of the\r\nmarvels that future A-G ships would find, as, manned by Earthly crews\r\nand carrying each star-being back to its galactic world, they opened up\r\non each planet new vistas of achievement, science, and artistic marvel.\r\n\r\nHe found himself staring into the yellow eyes of the big, purple\r\nhumanoid. His hand was grasped by the other's strangely shaped hand\r\nwhile a yellow, powdery creature like a human moth tried to touch Burl\r\nin fondness.\r\n\r\nBurl smiled widely and began to grasp the proffered tentacles, pincers\r\nand grippers.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome,\" he said to them all. \"Welcome to the solar system. We've got\r\na lot to talk about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\n\r\nDonald A. Wollheim was bitten early by the science-fiction bug. As a\r\nboy, he filled many thick notebooks and scrapbooks with clippings,\r\npictures, and facts about the planets, and astronomy in general.\r\n\r\nHe grew up in New York, graduating from New York University, and at once\r\nbegan a successful career as a free-lance writer of science fiction.\r\nSince 1946 he has been editor of a publishing house specializing in\r\npaperback books. A number of anthologies of the fantastic are the result\r\nof his editing.\r\n\r\nAware of the wide-spread interest in this subject, Mr. Wollheim decided\r\nto inaugurate science fiction conventions, and founded the Fantasy\r\nAmateur Press Association as well. He considers himself a true science\r\nfiction pioneer.\r\n\r\nAmong his hobbies are model soldiers. He is considered an authority on\r\nthem and has a fabulous collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Winston Science Fiction Novels by the Author_\r\n\r\n    THE SECRET of the MARTIAN MOONS\r\n    THE SECRET of SATURN'S RINGS\r\n\r\n_The Secret of the Ninth Planet_\r\n\r\nOn the day that the theft of the solar system's light begins. Burl\r\nDenning is with an archaeological expedition in the Andes, only a few\r\nmiles from the source of the \"disturbance.\" Within hours the United\r\nStates Air Force has ordered the expedition to investigate the strange\r\nphenomenon that is causing a dimness and a drop in temperature\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nThis is the start of a fantastic adventure that eventually takes Burl, a\r\nhigh-school senior, on the first circumnavigation of the solar system.\r\nOn planet after planet, he and the crew of the _Magellan_, a gleaming,\r\npowerful, and virtually untested spaceship, discover the weird trappings\r\nof a brilliantly-designed Sun-tap station. Each planetfall brings\r\nunexpected hazards, as the ship draws closer and closer to solving the\r\nmystery of the theft.\r\n\r\nThe author has based his story on science fact. Researchers are actually\r\nat work on the possibilities of just such a circumnavigation, and on\r\nanother surprising theory brought out in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Winston Science Fiction Novels\r\n\r\n\r\nANT MEN, THE by Eric North--_Geologists find living fossils in the\r\nbadlands of Central Australia_\r\n\r\nATTACK FROM ATLANTIS by Lester del Rey--_An atomic submarine crew\r\ndiscovers the lost city of Atlantis_\r\n\r\nBATTLE ON MERCURY by Erik Van Lhin--_Sun storms sweep Mercury and\r\nthreaten man's existence_\r\n\r\nDANGER: DINOSAURS! by Richard Marsten--_A treacherous big-game hunter\r\nleads an expedition back to the Age of Reptiles_\r\n\r\nEARTHBOUND by Milton Lesser--_An ex-space cadet is forced to plunder\r\nships he was trained to protect_\r\n\r\nFIVE AGAINST VENUS by Philip Latham--_A Moon-bound rocket crashes in the\r\nmisty wilds of Venus_\r\n\r\nISLANDS IN THE SKY by Arthur C.
