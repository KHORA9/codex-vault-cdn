FURNEAUX, F.R.G.S.\r\n\r\nAuthor of 'The Out-Door World, Or Young Collector's Handbook'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith Twelve Coloured Plates and Numerous Illustrations in the Text\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon\r\nLongmans, Green, and Co.\r\nAnd New York. 15 East 16th Street\r\n1894\r\n\r\nAll rights reserved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe favourable reception with which the 'Out-door World' has been\r\ngreeted has encouraged the publishers to issue a series of volumes\r\ndealing in fuller detail with the various branches of Natural History\r\ntreated of in that work. Necessarily each subject was only briefly\r\ntouched upon, but the study is of so enticing a character that 'appetite\r\ngrows by feeding,' and the students of the 'Out-door World,' having\r\ntasted the sweetness of companionship with Nature, will not rest\r\nsatisfied with the help afforded by that handbook. Each one will want to\r\ngo deeper into that particular department which most appeals to his own\r\ninclinations.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is written expressly for those who desire to extend\r\ntheir knowledge of the British Lepidoptera, or, to use the more popular\r\nnames, 'Butterflies and Moths.'\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics of this interesting order of insects are\r\ndescribed somewhat fully, but, of course, it would be impossible to give\r\nan individual account of all the British Lepidoptera in a work of this\r\nsize, so a selection has been made such as will satisfy the requirements\r\nof the great majority of those who intend to take up this particular\r\nbranch of entomology. The number of British Butterflies, however, is\r\nso limited that a place has been found for a figure and a description of\r\nevery species; and, of the larger moths, many of the common and typical\r\nkinds have been included. An introduction to the study of the\r\nMicro-lepidoptera has also been added.\r\n\r\nNo trouble has been spared to render this work thoroughly practical. In\r\naddition to the verbal descriptions of so many species, twelve coloured\r\nplates and a large number of woodcuts have been specially prepared to\r\nhelp the student in his work. It is believed that the extreme care with\r\nwhich these have been produced will render them of the greatest\r\nassistance to the collector in the recognition of his specimens.\r\n\r\nBut he has not only to recognise his specimens--he must first catch\r\nthem; and here full directions have been given to insure success in this\r\npart of his work, as well as in the management, preservation, and\r\narrangement of his captures.\r\n\r\nThe Author hopes that this volume may be the means of adding many happy\r\nhours--hours of the purest enjoyment--to the lives of those whom he has\r\nsucceeded in luring into the fields and lanes and woods of the Out-door\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  _STRUCTURE AND LIFE HISTORY OF THE LEPIDOPTERA_\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

It\r\nis formed from two Greek words, one (_lepis_) signifying a _scale_, and\r\nthe other (_pteron_) denoting a _wing_; and was applied by the great\r\nnaturalist Linnaeus to the scaly-winged insects popularly known as\r\nButterflies and Moths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SCALES FROM THE WINGS OF BUTTERFLIES.]\r\n\r\nEvery one of my readers has undoubtedly handled some of the interesting\r\ncreatures of this group--having been led to do so either by the extreme\r\nbeauty of their clothing, or, perhaps, from a murderous intent in order\r\nto protect his own garments from the ravages of a supposed marauder. A\r\nlight mealy powder will probably have been observed afterwards on the\r\nfingers that have touched the victim's wings.\r\n\r\nThis powder, although it sometimes presents a beautiful glossy surface\r\nwhen spread over the skin, does not exhibit any definite form or\r\nstructure without a more minute examination. Yet these are the scales\r\nthat led the immortal naturalist to invent the somewhat long but useful\r\nterm _Lepidoptera_.\r\n\r\nThe very next time the opportunity offers itself, dust off a little of\r\nthe mealy powder with a small and very soft brush on to a strip of white\r\npaper or a slip of glass, and examine it with a powerful lens or the low\r\npower of a compound microscope. What a sight you will then behold! Each\r\nlittle particle of dust is a beautifully formed scale, stamped with a\r\nnumber of minute rounded projections, and often displaying the most\r\ngorgeous colours. A great variety of designs and tints are often\r\nexhibited by the 'dust' from a single wing. Take, for instance, for your\r\ninspection, scales from the wing of one of our commonest insects, the\r\nSmall Tortoiseshell Butterfly (Plate III), and you will be surprised at\r\nthe pleasing contrasts. But when your curiosity leads you to deal with\r\nothers in the same manner, the varied display of forms and colours is\r\nsimply amazing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--PORTION OF THE WING OF A BUTTERFLY FROM WHICH\r\nSOME OF THE SCALES HAVE BEEN REMOVED.]\r\n\r\nIn order that we may learn still more of the structure of the wings of\r\nthe _Lepidoptera_, we will examine a portion of one from which some of\r\nthe scales have been removed, again bringing the lens or the microscope\r\ninto our service. We now see that the scales are arranged in rows with\r\ngreat regularity on a thin and transparent membrane, which is supported\r\nby a system of branching rays. And the membrane itself, in parts which\r\nhave been laid bare, is marked with regular rows of dots--the points at\r\nwhich the scales were originally attached by means of short hollow rods.\r\n\r\nThe framework that supports the thin membrane we have spoken of as\r\nconsisting of a system of _rays_, but to these the terms _veins_,\r\n_nerves_, _nervures_, or _nervules_ are more commonly applied by various\r\nnaturalists. We cannot do better, however, than adhere to the name\r\noriginally used, for the structures in question do not perform the\r\nfunctions of veins, though at first they contain blood, nor are they\r\nthemselves parts of the nervous systems of the insects to which they\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nThe result of our examination of the wings of butterflies and moths has\r\nbeen to justify the application of the term _Lepidoptera_; but we must\r\nnow study other equally important and interesting features of the\r\nstructure of these insects. First, let us note the general form of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--BODY OF A BUTTERFLY--UNDER SIDE.\r\n\r\n1-7, segments of the abdomen; 8, anal extremity; _a_, antennae; _b_,\r\ntarsus; _c_, tibia; _d_, femur; _e_, palpi; _f_, head; _g_, thorax.]\r\n\r\nA cursory glance at this portion of the creature's anatomy will show\r\nthat it consists of three distinct and well-defined parts. In front\r\nthere is the head, the size of which is somewhat small in proportion.\r\nTwo very large eyes make up the greater portion of its bulk. It is\r\nremarkable, too, that butterflies possess eyes proportionately much\r\nlarger than those of moths. Now, since butterflies always fly by day,\r\nand moths are, generally speaking, nocturnal insects, we might be led to\r\nsuppose that the reverse of this arrangement would have suited the\r\ncreatures better; for a small eye, we should think, would be able to\r\ncollect sufficient light in the daytime to form a bright image, and a\r\nlarger light-receiving area would be necessary during the darker hours\r\nfor the same purpose. But it is evident that the sense of vision must\r\ndepend on other conditions besides the size of the eye; and as these\r\nconditions are not understood in relation to the eyes of insects, any\r\nattempt at an explanation would be quite useless.\r\n\r\nThe eye of a butterfly or moth is worthy of a closer examination, for it\r\nis a most beautiful and marvellous structure. The outer globular\r\ntransparent membrane--the _cornea_--is divided into a large number of\r\nminute polygonal _facets_, each one of which admits light into a small\r\nconical compartment surrounded by a coloured membrane, and supplied with\r\na fibre of the nerve of vision (the _optic_ nerve). Hence the eye is\r\noften spoken of as _compound_.\r\n\r\nIf you look closely into the eyes of various butterflies and moths you\r\nwill generally see a ground colour of grey, blue, brown, or black; but\r\nwhen viewed at certain angles in a strong light the most gorgeous hues\r\nof metallic brilliancy--gold, copper, and bronze--are to be observed.\r\nAll such colours are due to the reflection of light from the colouring\r\nmatter that lies between the numerous conical compartments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--SECTION OF THE EYE OF AN INSECT.]\r\n\r\nA glance at the section of a compound eye will show you that all the\r\nlittle cones radiate from a common centre. And, as each little\r\ncompartment is surrounded by opaque colouring matter, it is clear that\r\nperpendicular rays only are capable of penetrating to its base and\r\nexciting the nerve fibre that lies there. Thus each little division of a\r\ncompound eye forms its own image of the object that happens to be\r\nexactly opposite its facet. But how many facets do we find in a single\r\neye? Sometimes only a few hundreds, but sometimes as many as seventeen\r\nor eighteen thousand! We must not, however, conclude that the nature of\r\nthe vision of butterflies and moths is necessarily very different from\r\nour own. We have two eyes, but the images formed by them are both\r\nblended, so that we do not see double. We can understand, therefore,\r\nthat the thousands of images formed in a single eye may be blended\r\ntogether so as to form one continuous picture. Still there remains this\r\ndifference: while in our own case the two images formed by the two eyes\r\nare practically the same, in the case of insects every one of the little\r\nconical tubes of a compound eye forms an image of an object that cannot\r\npossibly be formed by any one of the others. Thus, if the lepidopterous\r\ninsect sees a continuous picture of its surroundings, such a picture is\r\nproduced by the overlapping and blending, at their edges, of hundreds or\r\nthousands of distinct parts.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another interesting difference between the vision of these\r\ninsects and that of ourselves. As already stated, our two eyes are both\r\nturned toward the same point at the same time. But look at the\r\nbutterfly's eyes. Here are no movable eyeballs, and the two eyes, placed\r\nas they are at the _sides_ of the head, are always turned in _opposite_\r\ndirections. The corneae, too, are very convex; and consequently the range\r\nof vision is vastly wider than ours. A boy is often easily surprised by\r\na playmate who approaches him stealthily from behind, but did you ever\r\ntry the same game with a butterfly? I have, many a time. After getting\r\ncautiously so near to a butterfly at rest as to be able to distinguish\r\nbetween its head and its hinder extremity, I have quietly circled round\r\nit so as to approach it from behind, being at the time under the\r\nimpression that it wouldn't see me under those circumstances. But not\r\nthe slightest advantage did I derive from this stratagem, for the\r\nposition and construction of its eyes enabled it to see almost all ways\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two compound eyes, the _Lepidoptera_, or at least\r\nmost of them, are provided with two small simple eyes; but these are\r\ngenerally so hidden among the closely set hair that covers the head,\r\nthat it is doubtful whether they are of much service as organs of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--ANTENNAE OF BUTTERFLIES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--ANTENNAE OF MOTHS.]\r\n\r\nThe antennae proceed from two points close to the upper borders of the\r\neyes. They are jointed organs, and are of very different forms in the\r\nvarious species of _Lepidoptera_. They are generally long, slender, and\r\nclubbed at the extremity in butterflies, but exhibit several minor\r\npoints of difference which we shall have to note later on. In moths the\r\nantennae are sometimes long, slender, and pointed. Some are thick, and\r\nmore or less prismatic in form; while others are slightly or deeply\r\npectinated or comb-like. The antennae of butterflies are always\r\nstraight, or only slightly curved; and, although the insects can sway\r\nthem bodily, they have no power to bend them, or to stow them away in\r\nany place of shelter. Moths, on the other hand, when at rest, are almost\r\ninvariably found to have their antennae snugly tucked under the wings,\r\nand brought so closely against the side of the head for this purpose\r\nthat even the uncovered portion is often difficult to find.\r\n\r\nThere are two other prominent appendages belonging to the heads of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_. These are the _labial palpi_ or feelers of the lips. They\r\nare generally easily seen, projecting forward on the under side of the\r\nhead, sometimes so long and conspicuous as to give one the idea of a\r\nsnout or long nose. The palpi are jointed--usually in three parts--are\r\ncovered with scales, and often furnished with hairs or bristles.\r\n\r\nIf you watch a moth or butterfly when it is feeding on the sweet juices\r\nof a flower, or on some kind of artificial sweet with which you have\r\nprovided it, you will observe its long trunk or _proboscis_, by which\r\nfood is sucked up. This instrument is so long and slender that it seems\r\nalmost impossible that it can be a tube through which a liquid freely\r\npasses. But a careful examination will show that this is the case. It is\r\ncomposed of two separate pieces--two half tubes, which, when closely\r\napplied to each other, form a very thin and flexible pipe, perfectly\r\nair-tight and adapted for suction. Sometimes you can see a butterfly or\r\nmoth manipulating with its proboscis as if it required readjustment in\r\nsome way or other. It has split the tube throughout its length, so that\r\nit now looks like two exceedingly fine hairs. Then, after a short time,\r\nthe two halves are put together again, and immediately, as if by magic,\r\nbecome a single tube in which no kind of seam is to be observed without\r\na powerful magnifier.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe the nature of such a wonderful arrangement we must\r\nhave recourse to the aid of a good microscope. Thus assisted, we can see\r\nat once how the junction of the two sides of the proboscis is brought\r\nabout so quickly and so perfectly. The inner edges of each half are very\r\nregularly fringed with lines of closely set hairs--so regular, in fact,\r\nare they, that they give one the idea of long yet minute beautifully\r\nformed combs. When the two parts are brought together, the hairs of two\r\nopposite edges interlock, those on one side exactly filling the spaces\r\nbetween those of the other.\r\n\r\nThe microscope also reveals another interesting fact, viz. that the\r\nproboscis is not a single tube, but, although so remarkably thin, is\r\nreally a set of three distinct pipes, one lying on each side of the\r\ncentral one. It is said that the central tube only is used for sucking\r\nup the liquid food, and there seems to be some doubt as to the uses of\r\nthe other two. Some naturalists are of opinion that the latter are air\r\ntubes, and are connected with the respiration of the insect; while\r\nothers say that through these the insects eject a thin watery fluid with\r\nwhich to dissolve or dilute those sweetmeats that are not sufficiently\r\nliquid to be readily sucked up. But possibly both these opinions are\r\ncorrect, the proboscis serving all three of the purposes here named. The\r\nonly observation of my own bearing on the subject is this. While a moth\r\nwas feeding on a drop of syrup in a strong light, a powerful lens\r\nrevealed drops, of liquid, mingled with bubbles of air, passing\r\nalternately _up and down_ the two lateral tubes of the proboscis. At the\r\nsame time the upward current of syrup in the central tube was by no\r\nmeans steady and continuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--SECTION OF THE PROBOSCIS OF A BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\nWhen this organ is not in use, it is beautifully coiled into a close\r\nspiral which lies between the labial palpi. The length varies\r\nconsiderably in different insects, and consequently the number of turns\r\nin the spiral must differ also. Sometimes there are less than two turns,\r\nwhile some of the longer ones form spirals of from six to ten turns.\r\n\r\nIn concluding our brief account of the head of lepidopterous insects it\r\nis, I suppose, hardly necessary to add that there is no kind of chewing\r\napparatus to be described; all the members of this order, at least in\r\nthe perfect state, deriving the whole of the little nourishment they\r\nrequire entirely by suction through the proboscis or 'trunk.'\r\n\r\nThe second division of the body is the _thorax_. This is much larger\r\nthan the head, and consists of three ring-like segments, joined one\r\nbehind the other so intimately that the lines of junction are hardly\r\nvisible, even after the thick clothing of fine hair has been brushed\r\noff. Behind the thorax is the abdomen, which is composed of several\r\nsegments, the junctions between the rings often being most distinct.\r\n\r\nFrom the sides of the thorax proceed the two pairs of wings, the general\r\nstructure of which we have already to a certain extent examined. But\r\nwhen we are a little farther advanced in our insect studies, we shall\r\nhave to become acquainted with detailed descriptions given as aids to\r\nthe identification of species. Now, such descriptions cannot be\r\nsatisfactory, either to the one who gives or to him who receives, unless\r\nexpressed in such definite terms as render a misunderstanding\r\nimpossible. A botanist cannot give an accurate and concise description\r\nof a flower without the use of certain names and expressions which have\r\ngradually become an almost necessary part of his vocabulary; neither can\r\nan entomologist give a really useful, and, at the same time, a\r\n_succinct_ description of an insect unless he is acquainted with the\r\nnames of its parts. Therefore, seeing that we distinguish the various\r\nspecies of butterflies and moths _mainly_ by the arrangement and colour\r\nof the markings of their wings, it is really necessary that we should\r\nknow the names of the different parts of these organs. For this reason I\r\nhave inserted drawings of a fore and of a hind wing of a butterfly,\r\ntogether with the names of the various parts of the wings, and also the\r\nnames of the principal rays or _nervures_. Yet I would not advise any\r\nyoung entomologist to attempt to commit to memory all the names given.\r\nRather use the diagram for reference when occasion requires, more\r\nparticularly when you have an insect in your possession that you desire\r\nto study. In ordinary descriptions of butterflies and moths the names of\r\nthe _nervures_ are not so generally used as those of the _parts_ of the\r\nwing. Consequently it is exceedingly useful to know what is meant by the\r\nterms _base_, _costal margin_, _apex_, _hind margin_, _anal angle_,\r\n_inner margin_, _discoidal cell_ &c. as applied to the wing.\r\n\r\nThe two pairs of wings are attached to the second and third segments of\r\nthe thorax; but of the _three_ pairs of legs, which we have next to\r\nconsider, one pair arises from each of the three segments. The\r\narrangement of these limbs is well shown in the sketch on page 3, as are\r\nalso the names of the different parts of the limb, the latter being\r\ngiven for reference by the reader when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAll insects, in their perfect state, we are told, have three pairs of\r\nlegs; but if you examine the under surface of certain butterflies, such\r\nas the Marbled White, or any of the Vanessas, Browns, or Heaths, it is\r\nquite likely that you will raise objection to such a statement; for in\r\nthese you may possibly see only four legs. But this is the result of a\r\ntoo cursory observation. Look a little more closely at your specimen,\r\nand you will see a pair of smaller legs folded up under the fore part of\r\nthe thorax. By means of a blunt needle you can straighten out these\r\nlimbs, and then the difference in length to be observed between them and\r\nthe other four is very striking indeed. They are also thinner than the\r\nmiddle and hind legs; and, unlike these, are not provided with claws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--DIAGRAM OF THE WINGS OF A BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\nI. _Fore wing._--1-5, subcostal nervules; 6, 7, discoidal nervules;\r\n8-10, median nervules; 11, submedian nervure; 12, internal nervure;\r\n13-15, disco-cellular nervules; 16, interno-median nervule; 17, median\r\nnervure; 18, subcostal nervure; _a_, costal nervure; _b_, costa or\r\nanterior margin; _c_, apex or anterior angle; _d_, posterior or hind\r\nmargin; _e_, posterior or anal angle; _f_, interior or inner margin;\r\n_g_, base; _h_, discoidal cell.\r\n\r\nII. _Hind wing._--1, 2, subcostal nervules; 3, discoidal nervule; 4-6,\r\nmedian nervules; 7, submedian nervure; 8, precostal nervure; 9,\r\nsubcostal nervure; 10, median nervure; 11, 12, disco-cellular nervules;\r\n_a_, costal nervure; _b_, costa or anterior margin; _c_, apex or\r\nanterior angle; _d_, hind margin; _e_, tail or caudal appendage; _f_,\r\nanal angle; _g_, abdominal or inner margin; _h_, base.]\r\n\r\nThese imperfectly developed legs are, of course, quite useless as far as\r\nwalking is concerned; indeed, it is extremely doubtful as to whether\r\nthey are of any service whatever to the owner. On one occasion,\r\nhowever, while watching a Peacock Butterfly apparently engaged in\r\ncleaning its divided proboscis, I observed that this organ was\r\nfrequently passed under the thorax, and that the front pair of legs were\r\npressed against it on each side, while it was being drawn outward\r\nbetween them. It is probable, therefore, that these limbs constitute a\r\npair of brushes by means of which the fine grooves of the divided trunk\r\nare cleared of any solid or sticky matter that may lodge therein. It is\r\ncertain that moths, and those butterflies that possess six _equal_ legs,\r\nuse the front pair for this same purpose. The former, also, employ them\r\nfor brushing their antennae, which seem to be, by the way, particularly\r\nsensitive to different kinds of irritation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE UNDEVELOPED FORE LEG OF A BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that tobacco smoke has a powerful influence on\r\ncertain small insects; and even though it can hardly be regarded as a\r\nperfect all-round insecticide, it is certainly more or less\r\nobjectionable to the larger and hardier species. A short time since,\r\nwhile watching a number of newly emerged moths of the _Sphinx_ group,\r\nand at the same time enjoying the solace afforded by the luxurious weed,\r\na puff of the smoke was accidentally allowed to play into the box in\r\nwhich my pets were for the time imprisoned. Immediately they rubbed\r\ntheir front legs vigorously over the antennae, as if to remove the\r\nobnoxious irritant that had thus intruded on their presence. Similar\r\nobservations have led many naturalists to suppose that the antennae are\r\nthe seat of various senses, such as those of touch, hearing, and smell.\r\nSeeing that insects do not, as far as we know, possess special organs\r\nfor all the five senses which we enjoy (and it is interesting to note\r\nhere that some insects certainly experience other sensations which are\r\nquite beyond our ken), we can quite understand the common tendency to\r\nlocate the seats of certain of the senses in such easily affected parts\r\nas the antennae. But little, I believe, has been definitely proved save\r\nthat the antennae are sensitive to touch and to irritants generally.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the senses of insects, I cannot refrain from\r\nmentioning a most remarkable example of a peculiar sensitiveness that\r\nhas been observed in certain moths of the family _Bombyces_ (page\r\n217)--notably the Oak Eggar, the Emperor, and the Kentish Glory. Take a\r\nnewly emerged female of either of these species, shut her up in a small\r\nbox, conceal the box in your pocket, and then walk about in some\r\ncountry spot known to you as being one of the haunts of that species of\r\nmoth. Then, if any of the males of the same species happen to be in the\r\nneighbourhood, they will settle or hover about close to the female\r\nwhich, although still concealed and quite out of their reach, has\r\nattracted them to the spot.\r\n\r\nWhat a marvellously acute sense this must be, that thus enables the\r\ninsects to scent out, as it were, their mates at considerable distances,\r\neven when doubly surrounded by a wooden box and the material of a coat\r\npocket! You would naturally expect that entomologists have turned this\r\nwonderful power to account. Many a box has been filled with the\r\nbeautiful Kentish Glories of the male kind, who had been led into the\r\nsnare by the attractions of a virgin Glory that they were never to\r\nbehold. Many an Emperor has also been decoyed from his throne to the\r\nplace of his execution, beguiled by the imaginary charms of an Empress\r\non whom he was never to cast one passing glance. And these and other\r\nsimilar captures have been made in places where, without the employment\r\nof the innocent enchantress, perhaps not a single male could have been\r\nfound, even after the most diligent search.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this surprising sense, I am again tempted to revert to the\r\nantennae; for it is a remarkable fact that the males of those species of\r\nmoths which exhibit the power of thus searching out their mates, are\r\njust those that are also remarkable for their very broad and deeply\r\npectinated antennae--a fact that has led to the supposition that the\r\npower in question is located in the antennae, and is also proportional to\r\nthe amount of surface displayed by these organs.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time we have been considering the butterfly and moth\r\nin their perfect forms, but everybody knows that the former is not\r\n_always_ a butterfly, nor is the latter always a moth; but that they\r\nboth pass through certain preparatory stages before they attain their\r\nfinal winged state.\r\n\r\nWe shall now notice briefly what these earlier stages are, leaving the\r\ndetailed descriptions of each for the following chapters.\r\n\r\nThe life of the perfect butterfly or moth is of very short duration,\r\noften only a few days, nearly the whole of its existence having been\r\nspent in preparing itself for the brief term to be enjoyed\r\n\r\n                      ... in fields of light,\r\n  And where the flowers of Paradise unfold.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to consider of what use the metamorphoses of\r\ninsects are, and to what extent these metamorphoses render them fit for\r\nthe work they have to do.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the chief work of insects, taken as a whole, is to\r\nremove from the earth the excess of animal and vegetable matter. If they\r\nare to do this work effectually, it is clear that they must be very\r\nvoracious feeders, and also be capable of multiplying their species\r\nprodigiously. Now each of these powers requires the special development\r\nof a certain set of organs, and an abnormal development of one set must\r\nnecessarily be produced at the expense of the other. Hence we find\r\ninsects existing in two distinct stages, with or without an intermediate\r\nquiescent state, during the first of which the digestive apparatus is\r\nenormously developed, while the reproductive organs occupy but very\r\nlittle space; then, during the other stage, the digestive apparatus is\r\nof the simplest possible description, and the organs of reproduction are\r\nin a perfect state of development.\r\n\r\nAllowing, then, that the chief work of the insect is the removal of\r\nsurplus organic matter, we can see that a large share of its life should\r\nbe spent in the larval or grub stage, and that the perfect state _need_\r\nnot occupy any more time than is necessary for the fertilisation of the\r\neggs that almost completely fill the body of the female at the time of\r\nher emergence from the chrysalis shell.\r\n\r\nMany insects undergo their metamorphoses by slow degrees, but the\r\n_Lepidoptera_, after existing for some considerable period without any\r\nimportant visible change in structure, pass by a rapid transition into\r\nthe next state. Thus, a caterpillar, that has not altered in general\r\nform for several weeks, changes into a chrysalis within the course of a\r\nfew days; and again, after a period of quiescence that may extend\r\nthroughout the whole of the colder months, becomes a perfect butterfly\r\nor moth within twenty minutes of the moment of its emergence.\r\n\r\nBut this suddenness is more apparent than real, as may easily be proved\r\nby internal examinations of the insect at various stages of growth;\r\nshowing that we are led astray by the rapidity of _external_\r\nchanges--the mere _moultings_ or castings of the skin--while the gradual\r\ntransformations proceeding within are not so readily observed.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that the life of the perfect butterfly or moth is\r\nshort. A few days after emergence from the chrysalis case, the female\r\ndeposits her eggs on the leaves or stems of the plant that is to sustain\r\nthe larvae. Her work is now accomplished, and the few days more allowed\r\nher are spent in frolicking among the flowers, and sucking the sweet\r\njuices they provide. But males and females alike--bedecked with the most\r\ngorgeous colours and overflowing with sportive mirth when first they\r\ntake to the wing--soon show the symptoms of a fast approaching end.\r\nTheir colours begin to fade, and the beauty-making scales of the wings\r\ngradually disappear through friction against the petals of hundreds of\r\nflowers visited and the merry dances with scores and scores of playful\r\ncompanions. At last, one bright afternoon, while the sun is still high\r\nin the heavens, a butterfly, more weary than usual, with heavy and\r\nlaborious flight, seeks a place of rest for the approaching night. Here,\r\non a waving stalk, it is soon lulled to sleep by a gentle breeze.\r\n\r\nNext morning, a few hours before noon, the blazing sun calls it out for\r\nits usual frolics. But its body now seems too heavy to be supported by\r\nthe feeble and ragged wings, and, after one or two weak attempts at\r\nplay, incited by the approach of a younger and merrier companion, it\r\nsettles down in its final resting place. On the following morning a dead\r\nbutterfly is seen, still clinging by its claws to a swinging stem, from\r\nwhich it is eventually thrown during a storm.\r\n\r\nThe tale of the perfect moth is very similar to the above, except that\r\nit is generally summoned to activity by the approach of darkness.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that butterflies and moths exhibit none of that quality\r\nwhich we term parental affection. Their duty ends with the deposition of\r\nthe eggs, and the parents are dead before the young larvae have\r\npenetrated the shell that surrounds them.\r\n\r\nYet it is wonderful to see how unmistakably the females generally lay\r\ntheir eggs on the very plants that provide the necessary food for their\r\nprogeny, as if they were not only conscious of and careful concerning\r\nthe exact requirements of their offspring, but also possessed such a\r\nknowledge of botanical science as enabled them to discriminate between\r\nthe plant required and all others.\r\n\r\nHas the perfect insect any selfish motive in this apparently careful\r\nselection of a plant on which to lay its eggs? Does the female herself\r\nderive any benefit from the particular plant chosen for this purpose? In\r\nmost cases, certainly not. For it often happens that the blossom of this\r\nplant is not by any means one of those that supply the sweets which\r\ninsects love, and still more frequently does it occur that the eggs are\r\ndeposited either before the flowers have appeared or after they have\r\nfaded.\r\n\r\nNeither can we easily impute to the insect an acquired knowledge of the\r\nnature and wants of her offspring, or an acquaintance with botany\r\nsufficient to enable her to distinguish plant forms. Our only solution\r\nof the problem (which is really no solution at all) is to attribute the\r\nwhole thing to that inexplicable quality which we are pleased to term\r\n_natural instinct_. It is to be observed, however, that it is not _all_\r\nbutterflies and moths that display this unerring power. Some few seem to\r\ndeposit their eggs indiscriminately on all kinds of herbage. But, I\r\nbelieve, the larvae of these species are generally grass feeders, and\r\nwould seldom have to travel far from any spot without meeting with an\r\nacceptable morsel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--THE FOUR STAGES OF THE LARGE WHITE BUTTERFLY\r\n(_Pieris Brassicae_). _a_, larva; _b_, pupa; _c_, imago; _d_, egg.]\r\n\r\nBut we must now pass on to a brief consideration of the other stages of\r\nthe insect's existence. After a time, varying from a few days to several\r\nmonths, the young caterpillars or larvae make their appearance. They soon\r\ncommence feeding in right earnest. Their period of existence in this\r\nstate varies from a few weeks to several months, and even, in some\r\ncases, to years. During this time their growth is generally very rapid,\r\nand they undergo a series of _moults_ or changes of skin, of which we\r\nshall have more to say in a future chapter. Then, when fully grown, they\r\nprepare for an apparently quiescent form, which we speak of as the\r\n_pupa_ or chrysalis, and in which they again spend a very variable\r\nperiod, extending over a few days, weeks, or months. Now, inclosed in a\r\nprotective case, each pupa is undergoing a remarkable change. Some of\r\nits old organs are disappearing, and others are developing; and, after\r\nall the parts of the future insect have been developed as far as its\r\nnarrow shell will permit, it bursts forth into the world as a perfect\r\ninsect or _imago_.\r\n\r\nIts wings at first are small, shapeless, and crumpled in a most\r\nunsightly fashion; but it is not long before they assume their full\r\nsize, beautiful form, and gorgeous colouring. Then, in about another\r\nhour or two, the wings, at first soft and flaccid, have become\r\nsufficiently dry and stiff to bear their owner rapidly through the air.\r\n\r\nWe have thus observed some of the more striking features in the\r\nstructure of the butterfly and moth in its most perfect state; and\r\nalluded in a very brief manner to the various stages through which these\r\ncreatures must necessarily pass before finally reaching this stage. But\r\nnow we must study these earlier stages more closely, and watch the\r\ninsects during the marvellous transitions they are destined to undergo.\r\nThis we shall do in the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_THE EGG_\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose you are all acquainted with the general structure of the hen's\r\negg, having dissected several, in your own way, many a time.\r\n\r\nIts outer covering, which you speak of as the 'shell,' you have observed\r\nis hard and brittle. It is composed of a _calcareous_ or limy substance,\r\nknown chemically as _carbonate of lime_. If you put some pieces of it\r\ninto an egg cup, and throw over them a little vinegar or any other\r\nliquid acid, you will see them gradually dissolve away, and small\r\nbubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise into the air. Then again, if you\r\ntake a long and narrow strip of the shell, and hold one end of it in a\r\ngas or lamp flame, after a short time that end will become softer, and\r\nwill glow brightly in the flame, for it is converted into lime--the same\r\nsubstance that is used by the builders for making their mortar--and the\r\nbright glow is really a miniature _lime light_, such as is always\r\nproduced when a piece of lime is made intensely hot.\r\n\r\nJust inside this shell you have seen a thin membrane or skin that is\r\neasily peeled off the substance of the egg itself. Next to this comes\r\nthe 'white' of the egg, which is really colourless while liquid, but\r\nturns white and more or less solid in the cooking. Last of all, in the\r\ncentre of this, you have noticed the oval yellow mass that is termed the\r\n'yoke' or 'yolk,' and which contains the embryo of the future chick.\r\n\r\nNow if you imagine this egg to be reduced in size till two or three\r\ndozen of them would be required to form a single line about one inch\r\nlong, the outer calcareous shell to be entirely removed, the skin or\r\nmembrane to be converted into a firmer substance of a horny nature, and,\r\nfinally, the yolk to be absent and the whole internal space to be filled\r\nwith the 'white,' you will then have some idea of the nature of the egg\r\nof a butterfly or moth.\r\n\r\nTo put the matter more briefly, then, we will say that the eggs of these\r\ninsects are simply little liquid masses, usually of a colourless\r\nsubstance, surrounded by a horny and flexible covering.\r\n\r\nSuch a description may certainly give you some idea of the nature of the\r\neggs of insects, but no amount of book reading will serve the purpose so\r\nwell or be so pleasant as the examination of the eggs themselves. During\r\nthe summer months very little difficulty will be experienced in finding\r\nsome eggs in your own garden. Turn over some leaves and examine their\r\nunder surfaces, choosing especially those plants which show, by their\r\npartially eaten leaves, that they are favourites with the insect world.\r\nOr you may amuse yourself by catching a number of butterflies--common\r\n'Whites' are as good for the purpose as any--and temporarily confine\r\nthem in a wooden or cardboard box, containing a number of leaves from\r\nvarious plants, and covered with gauze. In this way you are sure to\r\nobtain a few females that have not yet laid all their eggs; and if you\r\nwatch your prisoners you will soon see them carefully depositing the\r\neggs on the under surfaces of leaves, bending their abdomens round the\r\nedges if there is not sufficient room to get themselves completely\r\nunder. And then, when you are satisfied with the number of eggs thus\r\nobtained for your examination, you can have the pleasure of seeing all\r\nyour liberated captives flying joyfully in the free air.\r\n\r\nIn giving these simple instructions I have assumed that the reader has\r\nnot yet learnt any of the characters by which female butterflies are to\r\nbe distinguished from their lords and masters; but I hope that he will\r\nknow soon, at least with regard to a good many species, from which\r\nindividuals he may most reasonably expect to obtain eggs, and so be able\r\nto avoid the imprisonment, even though only temporary, of insects which\r\ncannot satisfy his wants.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is not necessary, after all, that butterflies should be\r\ncaptured for the purpose of obtaining eggs. Watch them as they hover\r\nabout among your flowers. Some, you will observe, are intent on nothing\r\nbut idle frolicking; and you may conclude at once that _these_ have no\r\nimmediate duty to perform. Others are flying without hesitation from\r\nflower to flower, gorging themselves with the sweets of life: these are\r\nnot the objects of your search. But you will descry certain others,\r\nflying round about the beds and borders with a steadier and more\r\nmatronly air, taking little or no notice of their more frivolous\r\ncompanions, and paying not the slightest heed to the bright\r\nnectar-producing cups of the numerous flowers. These are seriously\r\nengaged with family affairs only. Watch one of them carefully, and as\r\nsoon as she has settled herself on a leaf, walk steadily towards her\r\ntill you are near enough to observe her movements. She will not move\r\nunless you approach too closely, for, like busy folk generally, she has\r\nno time to worry about petty annoyances. You will now actually witness\r\nthe deposition of the eggs exactly as carried on in the perfect freedom\r\nof nature; and the eggs themselves may be taken either for examination\r\nor for the rearing of the caterpillars.\r\n\r\nSome species of _Lepidoptera_ lay some hundreds of eggs, and it is\r\nseldom that the number laid by one female is much below a hundred.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the under surfaces of leaves are generally chosen for\r\nthe deposit of eggs, but a few of the insects we are considering always\r\nselect the upper surface for this purpose. Thus the Puss Moth (page\r\n235), and two or three others resembling it, though much smaller, known\r\nas the Kittens (page 234), invariably lay them on the upper surface. And\r\nthis is the more surprising since the eggs of these moths are brown or\r\nblack, and consequently so conspicuous on the green leaves as to be in\r\ndanger of being sighted by the numerous enemies of insects.\r\n\r\nThe Hairstreak Butterflies (page 183) afford another exception to the\r\ngeneral rule, for their eggs are deposited on the _bark_ of the trees\r\nand shrubs (birch, sloe, elm, oak, and bramble) on which their larvae\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nAt the moment each egg is laid it is covered with a liquid sticky\r\nsubstance, so that it is immediately glued to the leaf or stem as soon\r\nas it is deposited. The sticky substance soon dries, causing the egg to\r\nbe so firmly fastened in its place that it is often impossible to force\r\nit off without destroying it completely.\r\n\r\nSome of the _Lepidoptera_ deposit their eggs singly, or in small\r\nirregular clusters; but by far the larger number set them very regularly\r\nside by side, in so compact a mass that it would be impossible to place\r\nthem on a smaller area without piling one on top of another. This is not\r\naccomplished with the aid of the sight, for the insect performing her\r\ntask with such precision often has her head on one side of a leaf or\r\nstem while arranging her eggs on the other. If you take the trouble to\r\nwatch her, you will see that she carefully _feels_ out a place for each\r\negg by means of the tip of her abdomen immediately before laying it.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid by moths and butterflies at various seasons of the\r\nyear. In some cases they are deposited early in the spring, even before\r\nthe buds of the food plants have burst; and the young larvae, hatched a\r\nfew weeks later, commence to feed on the young and tender leaves. Then,\r\nthroughout the late spring, the whole of the summer and autumn, and even\r\ntill the winter frosts set in, the eggs of various species are being\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\nThose deposited during the warm weather are often hatched in a few days,\r\nbut those laid toward the autumn remain unchanged until the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIn this latter case the frosts of the most severe winter are not capable\r\nof destroying the vitality of the eggs. In many instances the perfect\r\ninsect or the larva would be killed by the temperature of an average\r\nwinter day, but the vitality of the eggs is such that they have been\r\nsubjected to a temperature, artificially produced, of fifty degrees\r\nbelow the freezing point, and even after this the young larvae walked out\r\nof their cradles at their appointed time just as if nothing unusual had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nExperiments have also been performed on the eggs with a view of\r\ndetermining how far their vitality is influenced by high temperatures.\r\nWe know that the scorching midsummer sun has no destructive influence on\r\nthem, but these experiments prove that they are not influenced by a\r\ntemperature only twenty degrees below the boiling point--actually a\r\nconsiderably higher temperature than is _necessary_ to properly cook a\r\nhen's egg.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine a number of eggs of different species, that we may\r\nnote some of the many variations in form and colour.\r\n\r\nWith regard to colour, we have already observed that the eggs of a few\r\nspecies are black; but more commonly they are much lighter--pearly\r\nwhite, green, yellow, and grey being of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of form, however, will provide a vast amount of\r\nenjoyment to anyone who possesses a good magnifying lens or a small\r\ncompound microscope. Some are globular, others oval; while many others\r\nrepresent cups, basins, and domes. Then we have miniature vases, flasks,\r\nbottles with short necks, and numerous figures that must remind a\r\njuvenile admirer of the sweet cakes and ornamental jellies that have so\r\noften gladdened his longing eyes.\r\n\r\nAgain, the beautifully sculptured surfaces of a large number are even\r\nmore striking than their general shapes. Some are regularly ribbed from\r\ntop to bottom with parallel or radiating ridges, and at the same time\r\nmarked with delicate transverse lines. Others are beautifully pitted or\r\nhoneycombed, some ornamented with the most faithful representation of\r\nfine wicker-work, while a few are provided with a cap, more or less\r\nornamental, that is raised by the young larva when about to see the\r\nworld for the first time. A few of these beautiful forms are here\r\nillustrated and named, and another has already appeared on page 14, but\r\nan enthusiastic young naturalist may easily secure a variety of others\r\nfor his own examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--EGG OF THE MEADOW BROWN BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--EGG OF THE SPECKLED WOOD BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--EGG OF THE VAPOURER MOTH.]\r\n\r\nIt may be surmised from the accompanying illustrations that the form of\r\nthe egg is always the same for any one species. This is really the case,\r\nand consequently an experienced entomologist can often decide on the\r\nname of the butterfly or moth that deposited a cluster of eggs he\r\nhappens to find in his rambles and searchings; but in such decisions he\r\nis always greatly assisted by a knowledge of the food plants of the\r\nvarious insects, and sometimes also by the manner in which the eggs are\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the period during which the _Lepidoptera_ remain in\r\nthe egg stage is very variable, and depends largely on the season in\r\nwhich they were laid; but it is often possible to tell when to expect\r\nthe young larvae by certain changes which take place in the appearance of\r\nthe egg. As the horny covering of the egg is transparent, the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the caterpillar from the clear fluid can be watched to a\r\ncertain extent; but if you have a microscope, and would like to witness\r\nthis development to perfection, proceed as follows.\r\n\r\nArrange that some butterflies and moths shall lay their eggs on strips\r\nof glass of convenient dimensions for microscopic work--three inches\r\nlong by one wide is the usual size for this kind of work. This is easily\r\naccomplished by placing a proper selection of female insects in a rather\r\nsmall box temporarily lined with such 'slips.' When a few eggs have thus\r\nbeen secured, all you have to do is to examine them at intervals with\r\nyour microscope, always using the reflector so as to direct a strong\r\nlight _through_ the eggs from below.\r\n\r\nBut even without such an arrangement some interesting changes are to be\r\nobserved. As a rule, the colour of the egg turns darker as the time for\r\nthe arrival of the infant larva approaches, and you will often be able\r\nto see a little brown or black head moving slightly within the 'shell.'\r\nYou may know then that the hatching is close at hand, and the movements\r\nof the tiny creature are well worth careful watching. Soon a small hole\r\nappears in the side of the case, and a little green or dark cap begins\r\nto show itself. Then, with a magnifier of some kind, you may see a pair\r\nof tiny jaws, working horizontally, and not with an up-and-down motion\r\nlike our own, gradually gnawing away at the cradle, till at last the\r\nlittle creature is perfectly free to ramble in search of food.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the young larva does not waste a particle of the horny\r\nsubstance that must necessarily be removed in securing its liberty, but\r\ndevours it with an apparent relish. Indeed, it appreciates the flavour\r\nof this viand so highly that it often disposes of the whole of its\r\nlittle home, with the exception of the small circular patch by which it\r\nwas cemented to the plant. When the whole brood have thus dispensed with\r\ntheir empty cradles, there remains on the stem or leaf a glittering\r\npatch of little pearly plates.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance of this feat the young caterpillar starts off in\r\nlife on its own account with as much briskness and confidence as if it\r\nhad previously spent a term in the world under the same conditions; but\r\nwe must reserve an account of its doings and sufferings for our next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_THE LARVA_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost every case the young caterpillar, on quitting the 'shell' of\r\nthe egg, finds itself standing on and surrounded by its natural food,\r\nand immediately commences to do justice to the abundant supply. It will\r\neither nibble away at the surface of the leaf, removing the soft\r\ncellular substance, so that the leaf exhibits a number of\r\nsemi-transparent patches when held up to the light, or it will make\r\nstraight for the edge, and, closing its horizontal jaws on either side,\r\nbite the leaf completely through, and thus remove a small piece each\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE CLOUDED YELLOW\r\nBUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\nSeveral naturalists have amused themselves by performing experiments and\r\nmaking calculations on the efficiency of the masticating and digesting\r\npowers of the caterpillar. The illustrious R['e]aumur, for example, proved\r\nthat some of the cabbage eaters disposed of more than twice their own\r\nweight of food in twenty-four hours, during which time their weight\r\nincreased one-tenth. Let us see what this would be equivalent to in\r\nhuman beings: A man weighing eleven stone would devour over three\r\nhundred pounds of food in a day, and at the end of that day weigh about\r\nfifteen pounds more than he did at the beginning!\r\n\r\nSo the young caterpillar eats, and rests, and grows, till, while still\r\nyoung, its body has become too large for the already tightened skin. It\r\nevidently feels very uncomfortable. Its appetite fails, and it remains\r\nfor a time perfectly quiet in one spot, having previously spun a little\r\ncarpet of silk to form a firm foothold during its temporary\r\nindisposition. Its colours have also become dingy, and anyone, not\r\nunderstanding the character of its growth, might easily be led to\r\nsuppose that the poor creature was displaying the earlier symptoms of a\r\nserious and perhaps fatal illness.\r\n\r\nBut soon an encouraging symptom is observed. The caterpillar begins to\r\nget restless. Its front segments are turned alternately right and left,\r\nand are also made to swell out much beyond their normal size. Then in a\r\nvery short time--often less than a minute from the first appearances of\r\nrestlessness--the skin, which has become somewhat dry and brittle,\r\nsplits along the back over the second, third and fourth segments,\r\nrevealing a new and bright coat beneath. The caterpillar continues its\r\nstruggles and, in addition to the previous movements, causes the\r\nswelling to move backward along the body. This, acting like a wedge,\r\ncauses the rent in the old coat to extend in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE DARK GREEN FRITILLARY\r\nBUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar now draws its head backward, and, with a few convulsive\r\nstruggles, pulls the front segments out of their old skin, and passes\r\nits head out of the rent in the back. With its foremost segments thus\r\nrendered perfectly free, it walks straight out of the old garment, which\r\nis left still fixed by the legs to the silken carpet.\r\n\r\nThe larva, although now fresh and smart in its appearance, is exhausted\r\nby these struggles and its prolonged fast. The new skin, moreover, is\r\nvery soft and tender, even to the cases of the head and legs, which are\r\nnormally very hard. But a short period of rest suffices to dry its skin\r\nand sharpen its appetite, and then it eats more vigorously than ever.\r\n\r\nWe will now leave the caterpillar for a moment while we look at its\r\ncast-off clothes. They are still clinging to a stem so firmly that they\r\ncan scarcely be removed without injury. The hard shell that covered the\r\nhead and jaws is perfect in form, and so are the claws and cases of the\r\nlegs. All the hairs or spines that happened to adorn the previous owner\r\nstill retain their positions; and the whole skin, although always more\r\nor less shrivelled, is sometimes so slightly altered in form that it\r\nmight be mistaken for a living caterpillar if not closely examined.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. For, according to the accounts of some\r\nauthoritative observers, the lining of the digestive organs, which is\r\nreally a continuation of the outer skin, is cast off (or rather cast\r\n_out_) at the same time, as are also the linings of the larger breathing\r\ntubes which are presently to be described.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that some caterpillars, on quitting their egg cases (which\r\nmay really be regarded as the first moult), make their first meal of the\r\nold covering. So also some of them, in their future moultings, exhibit\r\nan apparently useless economy (seeing that they are surrounded by an\r\nabundance of their natural vegetable diet) by devouring their old coats!\r\nIn the face of this fact we can hardly describe them as strict\r\nvegetarians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE PURPLE EMPEROR\r\nBUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus passed through its first hardship, the caterpillar has by no\r\nmeans seen the end of the troubles and dangers that beset it; for,\r\nduring its existence in the larval state, it has to go through a series\r\nof three, four, five, or even six moults, all of which are periods of\r\nconsiderable inconvenience, and perhaps even pain, and frequently prove\r\nfatal. And it is by no means an uncommon thing to meet with the lifeless\r\nbody of an unfortunate individual who, as shown by its shabby appearance\r\nand the silken carpet under its feet, has evidently fallen a victim to\r\nthe dangerous process of ridding itself of an old garment.\r\n\r\nBut this is only one of the many dangers to which caterpillars are\r\nexposed. Throughout every hour of the day the sharp and hungry eyes of\r\nthe numerous insect-eating birds are searching the leaves for such\r\ndelicacies to satisfy the wants of themselves and their broods. The\r\nlively little lizards, too, during the sunny hours are busily engaged in\r\nsearching them out among the foliage of heaths and banks.\r\n\r\nVery formidable enemies also exist in the form of Ichneumon and other\r\nspecies of flies, which pierce the skins of caterpillars with their\r\nsharp _ovipositors_, and lay their eggs within the bodies of the\r\nunfortunate victims. As soon as the young larvae are hatched from these\r\neggs, they commence feeding on the fatty substance stored beneath the\r\ncaterpillar's skin. They carefully avoid, at first, attacking the vital\r\norgans of their host's body, and in this way secure for themselves a\r\nmore lasting supply of fresh food. When the fatty substance is nearly\r\nall gone, they eat their way into the more important structures, of\r\ncourse steadily growing all the time; and so, even though the body of\r\nthe caterpillar is rapidly diminishing, the total bulk shows often no\r\nvery appreciable decrease in size. When the larvae of the flies are fully\r\nfed, they either change to the pupa within the carcase of their host, or\r\neat their way out of its body and construct for themselves a cocoon in\r\nwhich to undergo the transformation.\r\n\r\nAs for the caterpillar itself, it sometimes dies before the time for its\r\nmetamorphosis has arrived; but it often changes to the chrysalis before\r\nits fate is sealed. In this latter case, a number of flies, having\r\nundergone their final transformation within the chrysalis shell (there\r\nbeing but little else than shell remaining of the victim's body), break\r\nforth from the remains of the carcase somewhere about the time at which\r\nthe butterfly or moth should have appeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--AN ICHNEUMON FLY (_Cryptus Migrator_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--ANOTHER ICHNEUMON FLY (_Pimpla Instigator_).]\r\n\r\nCaterpillars have also their nocturnal enemies and devourers, among\r\nwhich may be mentioned frogs, toads, newts, and insect-eating mammals.\r\n\r\nWe must now learn something of the structure of caterpillars; and then\r\nbecome acquainted with their habits, and the change to the chrysalis or\r\npupa.\r\n\r\nTake a caterpillar from your garden, preferably a full-grown one of a\r\nrather large species, that is not very densely covered with hair, and\r\nexamine it carefully as we note the main points in its structure. The\r\nfirst point that strikes our notice is the division of its body into\r\nsegments or rings, separated from each other by a more or less distinct\r\nline or slight constriction of the body.\r\n\r\nThere are thirteen of these segments, reckoning, as is usual, the head\r\nas the first.\r\n\r\nThe head is usually very hard, and often of a much darker colour than\r\nthe rest of the body. It is also frequently divided into two lobes by a\r\ncouple of oblique lines, between which the parts of the mouth are\r\nsituated. The two powerful horizontal jaws, to which we have already\r\nreferred, are very hard and sharp, and curved like a sickle, and\r\ntherefore splendidly adapted for biting from the edges of leaves. The\r\nhead is also provided with a pair of antennae, usually very short and\r\ninconspicuous and protected by a horny covering.\r\n\r\nUnlike the perfect insect, the caterpillar has no large compound eyes,\r\nbut twelve very small simple eyes, situated on the cheeks, very near the\r\nmouth--six on each side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ANGLE SHADES MOTH\r\n(_Meticulosa_).]\r\n\r\nIf you examine them with a magnifier, you see that each one is provided\r\nwith a small and very convex lens--a lens of very _short focus_, such as\r\nwould be used for the examination of small objects held very near to the\r\neye. From this arrangement we should be inclined to conclude that the\r\ncaterpillar can see only those objects that are close to its mouth; and\r\nthis idea is strengthened if you place one in a box containing a number\r\nof leaves, one of which is that of its own food plant. It will wander\r\nabout the box, apparently looking at every part of every leaf it passes,\r\nafter the manner of a very short-sighted individual, and never taking a\r\ngeneral look round. A butterfly or a moth can see a flower in the\r\ndistance, for it flies unhesitatingly from one to another in the\r\nstraightest and shortest path, but if you place a caterpillar in the\r\ncentre of a ring composed of a leaf of its food plant and nine others\r\nfrom other plants, the chances are (nine to one) that it will _not_ walk\r\ntowards what it would like to have.\r\n\r\nAgain, the eyes are situated on the _lower_ part of the cheek, directed\r\nslightly downward, and are therefore adapted for seeing what is just\r\nunder its jaws as it walks along. Had we no knowledge whatever of the\r\ncaterpillar's twelve little eyes, we should probably have thought that\r\nit sought out its food by some sense other than that of vision.\r\n\r\nAnother important and interesting feature of the head is the\r\nsilk-spinning apparatus, situated under cover of the lower lip. This\r\nconsists of two tubular glands, corresponding to our own salivary\r\nglands, the special purpose of which is to secrete a viscid fluid that\r\nsolidifies on exposure to air. The opening by which the fluid escapes is\r\nso situated that the caterpillar can easily apply it to the surface of\r\nany object over which it is walking, and then, by drawing or turning\r\naway its head, cause a silken fibre to be produced.\r\n\r\nSome caterpillars make use of this spinning apparatus only on a few\r\nspecial occasions, but others, more especially some of the smaller\r\nspecies, seem to have it always in use, so that if at any time you\r\nsuddenly start them into the air by giving a smart tap to the plant or\r\ntwig on which they rest, they invariably fall slowly on the end of a\r\ngrowing web, the spinning of which they stop as soon as they consider\r\nthey have fallen far enough. Sometimes, as you are walking through a\r\nwood, you will see hundreds, nay, thousands of little caterpillars thus\r\nsuspended, swinging gently in the breeze. Not long since, after only a\r\nfew minutes' walk among the trees of Epping Forest, I found I was\r\ndecorated with several dozens of these swingers with which I had come\r\ninto collision--in this case consisting chiefly of the larvae of the\r\nGreen Tortrix Moth (_Tortrix viridana_).\r\n\r\nNow let us examine the caterpillar's limbs. Attached to each of the\r\nsecond, third, and fourth segments is a pair of true walking legs,\r\ncorresponding with those of the perfect insect. These are covered with a\r\nhard and shining substance, and are also each provided with a hook. The\r\nfifth and sixth segments have no limbs at all, nor have the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth, but some or all of the others (seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth,\r\nand thirteenth) are furnished with a pair of claspers which we shall\r\npresently describe.\r\n\r\nFirst, as regards the number of claspers, it will be seen from what has\r\njust been said that this is not always the same. Some caterpillars\r\npossess five pairs, thus making up the total number of walking\r\nappendages to sixteen. In fact, we must regard this as the _usual_\r\nnumber. But there are at least a few hundred exceptions to the rule.\r\nMany of the _Bombyces_ (page 217), for example, have only four pairs of\r\nclaspers; and in others of the same group the fifth pair is present, but\r\nonly partially developed, and quite useless for walking.\r\n\r\nLook at the peculiar caterpillar of the Lobster Moth (fig. 23)--a\r\ncreature that differs from most other caterpillars not only in its\r\nclaspers, but in many other respects too. Observe its long and slender\r\nlegs, its humped middle segments, and its upturned hindermost segment,\r\nof enormous size and mounted with a pair of clubbed 'horns.' This last\r\nsegment you will observe, has no claspers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--WALKING LEG OF A CATERPILLAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21--LARVA OF THE YELLOW UNDERWING MOTH (_Pronuba_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--LARVA OF THE CRIMSON SPECKLED MOTH\r\n(_Pulchella_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--LARVA OF THE LOBSTER MOTH (_Fagi_).]\r\n\r\nAnother allied caterpillar is that of the Iron Prominent Moth (fig. 24).\r\nThis one also has humped segments, and the claspers of the thirteenth\r\nsegment are imperfectly developed.\r\n\r\nA large number of other exceptions to the general rule are to be found\r\nin the caterpillars of the Geometer Moths (page 268), one of which is\r\nhere represented. These have generally only two pairs of claspers, one\r\npair on each of the tenth and last segments, so that there is a distance\r\nequal to the combined length of six segments between the hindermost true\r\nleg and the first pair of claspers. But even among the Geometers there\r\nare variations to be observed in the number of claspers, and some of\r\nthese will be pointed out in our brief descriptions of the commoner\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--CATERPILLAR OF THE IRON PROMINENT MOTH\r\n(_Dromedarius_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--LARVA OF THE BRIMSTONE MOTH (_Luteolata_).]\r\n\r\nThese limbs which we have been calling claspers are known by several\r\nother names. Thus they are termed 'pro-legs,' 'temporary legs,' 'false\r\nlegs,' and 'abdominal legs;' but if you watch a caterpillar as it walks\r\nup a stalk or along the edge of a leaf, you will certainly agree that\r\nthe term 'clasper' is everything that could be desired. But why not call\r\nthem legs, seeing that they are used in walking? The reason is that they\r\ndiffer in many respects from the three foremost pairs of limbs as\r\nregards structure, persistency, and function. The true legs, as we have\r\ncalled them, continue to exist, though concealed, in the chrysalis\r\nstate, and again appear, far more perfectly developed, in the butterfly\r\nor moth, but the claspers are no more to be seen after the caterpillar\r\nhas passed into the quiescent stage. We have noticed, too, that the true\r\nlegs are pointed and clawed, also that they are protected by a hard and\r\nhorny covering; but examine a large caterpillar, holding it between the\r\nfingers and thumb with its under side uppermost, and you will soon see\r\nthat the claspers are not at all hard, but soft and fleshy; not pointed,\r\nbut often terminating in a broad flat circular surface. You will also\r\nobserve, as the creature struggles to escape from your grasp, and tries\r\nto get a hold on something with its claspers, that these limbs, if we\r\nmay so call them, are retractile, and are sometimes completely drawn\r\ninto the body. Finally, examine the broad end of a clasper with a\r\nmagnifier, and you will see it surrounded by a circle of little hooks,\r\nturning in all directions. You will no longer wonder how it is that a\r\ncaterpillar can hold so tenaciously to a piece of twig that it is often\r\nalmost impossible to remove it without injury.\r\n\r\nNow put your caterpillar down, so that you may observe its gait. If it\r\nhappens to be one with the full complement of sixteen limbs, you see\r\nthat at each stride it makes but little progress. The segments contract\r\nand relax alternately and in succession, thus sending a series of\r\nwave-like motions along the body, and urging onward the front segments\r\nwhile the claspers keep the hinder portion firmly fixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--THE CLASPERS OF A CATERPILLAR.]\r\n\r\nBut if your caterpillar is one of the Geometers, with only two, or\r\nperhaps three, pairs of claspers, the mode of procedure is very\r\ndifferent. The creature stretches its body out at full length, often\r\nraising its head high in the air, and swinging its long body right and\r\nleft with a most furious motion, as if to hastily scan the\r\nneighbourhood. Then, having satisfied itself as to the _direction_ of\r\nits proposed course (which, by the way, is often changed considerably at\r\nalmost every stride), it holds on by the true legs and pulls its hinder\r\nquarters forward till the body forms almost a closed loop, with the\r\nfourth segment nearly touching the ninth. The claspers now become the\r\nholdfasts. The little hooks with which they are provided are firmly\r\nfixed to the surface on which it is walking; and the body being again\r\nstraightened out to its utmost length, the same man[oe]uvre is repeated.\r\nSo, you see, the insect progresses by strides equal in length to about\r\nsix segments of the body, and these the longest segments generally; and\r\nthe rate at which the strides succeed each other, especially in some of\r\nthe smaller species, is really astonishing.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the caterpillar in the act of taking its walk, and now we\r\nwill give it a twig of its food plant so that we may see it feed. It\r\nwalks up the twig without hesitation--for caterpillars (excepting those\r\nwhich feed on roots) always seem to move upward when in search of\r\nfood--and soon finds itself on a leaf. Over this it walks till it\r\nreaches the edge; and, grasping the edge firmly between the claspers, so\r\nas to give perfectly free play to its legs and head, it stretches its\r\nbody at full length, and takes a series of bites as it brings its head\r\nbackward in a curve. When the head has thus been brought close to its\r\nfore legs, the body is again extended, and the same ground is gone over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIf the caterpillar is a fairly large and hardy one, it will bite through\r\nthe smaller veins, and perhaps even the larger ones; but the smaller\r\nspecies often change their position on reaching a moderately thick vein,\r\nand so devour little else than the soft cellular substance of the leaf.\r\nIn any case, it is astonishing to see how rapidly the leaf disappears\r\nunder the influence of the powerful jaws and marvellous digestive\r\napparatus of the hungry grub.\r\n\r\nThose who take a delight in watching the _movements_ of caterpillars are\r\nsure to be interested in observing them when at rest; for at such times\r\nthe various attitudes assumed are as pleasing and instructive as are\r\ntheir active moments. And these attitudes are all the more interesting\r\non account of the mimicry by which the creatures often baffle their\r\nnumerous enemies. We may profitably spend a little time in studying a\r\nfew cases in point.\r\n\r\nMany species, when at rest, fix themselves by means of their claspers to\r\na small twig or leaf stalk, or on the midrib of the leaf itself. Here\r\nthey remain perfectly still, with their bodies perfectly straight or\r\nwith head slightly raised. I need hardly say that these generally fix\r\nthemselves on the _under_ side of the leaves and stalks, thus securing\r\nthemselves against the attacks of the feathered foes above. But some\r\nbirds are equal to the caterpillars in this matter; and it is really\r\namusing to see them hopping about beneath the leaves in our gardens,\r\nevery now and again slyly turning one eye upward, and smartly plucking\r\nan unwary grub from its resting place.\r\n\r\nThe precautions of the caterpillar, however, do not end merely with the\r\nselection of an under surface. You will find that the bright green\r\nspecies invariably settle on a leaf or a _green_ stalk, while the darkly\r\ncoloured insects often choose a twig covered with a brownish bark. Some\r\neven make for the _trunk_ of the tree on which they feed, and here\r\nremain quite still in a vertical position, so that they look just like a\r\nridge in the bark, the colour of which is faithfully imitated by their\r\nskin. Further, many of the caterpillars that resort to this stratagem\r\nhave bodies that are notched or knotted and spotted in such a manner\r\nthat the resemblance to their surroundings is so perfect as to defy any\r\nbut the most experienced eye. And even this is not all, for a number of\r\nthese mimics of the insect world never venture to feed by day, but take\r\nin their quantum of provisions during the dark hours, and practise their\r\ndeceptions throughout the day.\r\n\r\nMost of the Geometer caterpillars, of which we have already spoken, are\r\nwell trained in the art of deception. You are out on a caterpillar hunt,\r\nand engaged in carefully turning over the twigs of the hazel or some\r\nother shrub, so that you may the more readily examine the under surfaces\r\nof the leaves. At last you lay hold of a small broken twig for this very\r\npurpose. To your astonishment it is very soft, and readily bends between\r\nyour fingers. You look more closely at this peculiar piece of stick, and\r\nfind, to your surprise, that you have grasped a looper caterpillar that\r\nwas standing out at an angle just like a broken twig, supported by its\r\ntwo pairs of claspers, and coloured and knotted exactly like the little\r\nbranch on which it rested.\r\n\r\nAt other times you meet with little green caterpillars of the same\r\ngroup, supporting themselves in exactly the same manner on a small twig,\r\nand looking just like a leaf stalk from which the blade had fallen or\r\nbeen devoured.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful power is exhibited in the grasp of the claspers and the\r\ntension of the muscles, enabling the caterpillar to fix itself and\r\nretain its position for so long a time! Imagine an acrobat fixing\r\nhimself by his hands on an upright pole, throwing out his body at an\r\nangle, and without any further support retaining his position motionless\r\nfor several hours!\r\n\r\nOther experiences of the larva hunter are equally interesting and,\r\nperhaps, even more tantalising. He is engaged in very cautiously turning\r\nover the leaves of a certain food plant from which he hopes to obtain\r\nthe larva of a much-coveted species. Then, just as his eye catches a\r\nglimpse of the very object of his search, down falls the caterpillar,\r\nrolled up into a little ball, among the herbage below. This latter is\r\ndiligently and patiently examined. But no, the anticipated prize is\r\nnowhere to be seen. It is probably a green one, and this adds to the\r\ndifficulty of the patient entomologist. Then, as he carefully separates\r\nthe low herbs, hoping to find the spot where the larva had fallen, the\r\ninsect, rolled up into a compact little ball, only sinks deeper and\r\ndeeper into the maze.\r\n\r\nMany caterpillars avoid capture in this manner, while others seek to\r\navoid detection by remaining perfectly motionless, even when roughly\r\nhandled. They allow themselves to drop from their resting place on the\r\nslightest sign of danger, and, when the alarm is over and all is quiet\r\nagain, they ascend the food plant and resume their position.\r\n\r\nSome caterpillars not only rest, but even feed under cover, quite secure\r\nfrom most, if not all, of their enemies. Several of them feed on roots,\r\nand many a farmer can relate sad experiences of the havoc committed by\r\nthese caterpillars on his turnips and other crops. Then there are those\r\nwhich feed on flowers and buds, completely burying themselves in the\r\ndense mass of food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--THE HOMES OF LEAF MINERS AND LEAF ROLLERS.]\r\n\r\nWe must conclude this brief account of resting and hiding places and\r\nattitudes of caterpillars by a few observations on the leaf miners and\r\nleaf rollers.\r\n\r\nThe former are very small caterpillars--the larvae of certain small\r\nmoths--that eat burrows into leaves without doing any considerable\r\ninjury to the outer _epidermis_, and thus prepare a safe resting place\r\nwithin the substance of their food.\r\n\r\nThe latter, also mostly of small size, make themselves secure by curling\r\na leaf or a portion of a leaf into a cylinder, and holding it in\r\nposition by means of a number of silken threads.\r\n\r\nIf you examine a leaf thus curled you will soon be convinced that a\r\nconsiderable number of the extremely delicate threads must be necessary\r\nto hold it in position; but, if you would like to know how a very small\r\nand feeble caterpillar can manage to roll up a comparatively large and\r\nrigid leaf, you must watch the little creature at its work.\r\n\r\nYou need have but little difficulty in finding a willing worker, for\r\nsuch caterpillars are extremely numerous. Take a few out of their\r\nself-made homes, place them on a sprig of the food plant, and you will\r\nsoon have the pleasure of seeing one start its extraordinary work.\r\n\r\nAt first it spins a number of threads stretching from the edge of a leaf\r\nto about the middle of the surface. These threads are not tight by any\r\nmeans, and the leaf is, as yet, unchanged in position. But now the\r\nlittle mechanic exhibits a tact that almost seems to prove a knowledge\r\nof the principles of its art. Each thread in turn is pulled _at right\r\nangles_ at its middle, and then fastened by means of the creature's\r\nspinneret. Each time this is done the edge of the leaf is bent round _a\r\nlittle_; and when at last the cylinder is completed, a number of other\r\nthreads are stretched across from the scroll to the flat part of the\r\nleaf to secure it firmly in its place.\r\n\r\nMany caterpillars are solitary in their habits: that is, they are always\r\nfound singly, whether walking, resting, or feeding. But a large number\r\nof species are gregarious, living in dense clusters either throughout\r\ntheir larval state or, perhaps, only while young. In many such cases it\r\nis difficult or even impossible to find any reason for this gregarious\r\ntendency--to discover any advantage that the insects may derive from the\r\nhabit. Many species, however, are true co-operators in the defence of\r\ntheir communities. The caterpillars of such live in clusters, sometimes\r\nseveral scores in each, and all help in the spinning of a complicated\r\nmass of silk fibres, which, with the leaves and twigs they join\r\ntogether, form a safe home in which they can rest, feed, or change to\r\nthe chrysalis state. In early summer hundreds of such caterpillar\r\n'nests' are to be seen in many of our hawthorn and other hedgerows.\r\n\r\nBefore closing our general account of the caterpillar we must have a\r\nword to say about the breathing apparatus, more especially as in our\r\nfuture descriptions we shall frequently have to mention the colours and\r\nmarkings which surround the openings in its body through which the air\r\nsupply is admitted.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the sides of the segments of a caterpillar, using a lens\r\nif the insect is a small one, you will observe some little round holes,\r\noften inclosed in a ring or a patch of some prominent colour. These are\r\nthe _spiracles_ or openings of a series of air tubes called _tracheae_.\r\nThese latter divide and subdivide within the body of the caterpillar,\r\nthe branches of one often uniting with those of another, thus forming a\r\nreally complicated arrangement of air pipes by which the supply of\r\noxygen is distributed.\r\n\r\nA microscopic examination of a portion of one of the tracheae will show\r\nthat its walls are supported by an elastic spiral of a firm substance.\r\nThis arrangement serves to keep the air passages open, and secures for\r\nthe caterpillar a free supply of air at times when a contraction of the\r\nsegments would otherwise cause the tubes to collapse.\r\n\r\nThere are nine spiracles on each side of the caterpillar's body, and\r\nnever more than one in the side of the same segment. The head, which we\r\nhave been regarding as the first segment, has no spiracles. The second\r\nsegment has a pair--one on each side. There are none in the third and\r\nfourth; but all the segments, from the fifth to the twelfth inclusive,\r\nhave each a pair; the last (thirteenth) segment has none.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed the general arrangement of the caterpillar's\r\nlimbs; but perhaps it may be interesting and even convenient to the\r\nreader to give here a little table that will show at a glance the\r\ndisposition of both limbs and spiracles.\r\n\r\n  First segment--head        Two short antennae, two jaws,\r\n                               and twelve eyes.\r\n  Second      \"              Legs and spiracles.\r\n  Third       \"              Legs only.\r\n  Fourth      \"              Legs only.\r\n  Fifth       \"              Spiracles only.\r\n  Sixth       \"              Spiracles only.\r\n  Seventh     \"              Spiracles, and sometimes\r\n                               claspers.\r\n  Eighth      \"              Spiracles, and sometimes\r\n                               claspers.\r\n  Ninth       \"              Spiracles, and sometimes\r\n                               claspers.\r\n  Tenth       \"              Spiracles, and generally\r\n                               claspers.\r\n  Eleventh    \"              Spiracles only.\r\n  Twelfth     \"              Spiracles only.\r\n  Thirteenth  \"              Claspers only, and these\r\n                               occasionally absent.\r\n\r\nWe must now watch the caterpillar through its later days, to see how it\r\nprepares for passing into the pupal stage, and to witness the various\r\ninteresting changes that take place at this period.\r\n\r\nWhen fully grown, it ceases to eat, and begins to wander about in search\r\nof a convenient spot for the coming event. Its colours fade, and the\r\nbody becomes appreciably smaller, especially in length, as it ejects the\r\nwhole contents of its digestive apparatus. According to some accounts,\r\nit even evacuates the lining of the intestines with their contents.\r\n\r\nA great variety of situations are chosen by the different species at\r\nthis time. Some will fix themselves on their own food plant, and there\r\nremain till they finally emerge in the perfect state, suspending\r\nthemselves from a silken carpet, hiding themselves in a rolled leaf, or\r\nconstructing a cocoon of some kind. A large number walk down the food\r\nplants, and undergo their changes in moss that happens to lie at the\r\nfoot; or construct a cocoon on the surface of the ground, utilising for\r\nthe purpose any decayed leaves, fragments of vegetable matter, or pieces\r\nof earth or small stones. Many seek a further protection than this, and\r\nburrow into the soil, where they either lie in a little oval cell that\r\nthey prepare, or in a cocoon constructed by spinning together some\r\nparticles of earth. Again, there are those caterpillars, chiefly of\r\nbutterflies that frequent our gardens, which find their way to the\r\nnearest wall or fence, and there secure themselves in a sheltered nook.\r\nWe will watch a few of these varied methods of procedure, taking as our\r\nfirst instance the caterpillar of the common Large White or Cabbage\r\nButterfly.\r\n\r\nWhen fully fed, this larva seeks out a sheltered spot, generally\r\nselecting the under surface of some object, or of the ledge of a wall or\r\nfence. Sometimes it will not even leave its food plant, though it\r\ngenerally walks some considerable distance before a suitable shelter is\r\nfound. Having satisfied itself as to the site of the temporary abode, it\r\nsets to work at spinning a silken carpet. At first the threads spread\r\nover a rather wide area, and seem to be laid in a somewhat irregular and\r\naimless manner; but after a little time its labours are concentrated on\r\none small spot, where it spins several layers of silk fibres.\r\n\r\nThis done, it fixes the little hooks of the claspers firmly in its\r\ncarpet bed, and then proceeds with a highly interesting movement. It is\r\nnot satisfied with only the one mode of suspension. In fact, this alone\r\nwould hardly be safe, for when it casts its skin, as it is shortly about\r\nto do, its claspers will all disappear; and although it afterwards\r\nsecures itself by the 'tail,' it would be dangling in such a manner as\r\nto swing with every breeze--a very unsatisfactory state of affairs,\r\nespecially with those that pupate late in the summer and remain in the\r\npupal state throughout the winter storms.\r\n\r\nIts next procedure, then, is to make a strong silk band round the middle\r\nof its body, so as to keep it close to the surface against which it\r\nrests. But how is this to be done? It bends its head round till the\r\nspinning organ can be applied to a point close beside the middle of its\r\nbody. Here it fixes one end of a thread; and then, gradually twisting\r\nits body, brings its head round to the other side, still keeping it\r\nclose to the same segment, and fastens the other end of the thread\r\nexactly opposite the point at which it started.\r\n\r\nThe head is now brought back to its former position, thus adding another\r\nthread to the band; and the process is repeated several times, till at\r\nlast the caterpillar is satisfied with the thickness and strength of the\r\ncord formed.\r\n\r\nNow it straightens out its body as if to rest from its labours; but the\r\nwork is not yet complete. Soon it exhibits much restlessness. Its\r\nforemost segments are seen to shorten, and consequently become thicker.\r\nThen the skin splits, and the last moult of the caterpillar commences.\r\nThe movements that follow are exactly similar to those we have already\r\ndescribed in connection with one of the earlier moults: the alternate\r\nand successive contractions of all the segments gradually force back the\r\nold coat, and this is finally thrown entirely off by a somewhat vigorous\r\nwriggling of the 'tail.'\r\n\r\nThen, for a moment, the creature is supported only by its silken cord.\r\nBut this lasts _only_ for a moment. For, as soon as it is quite free\r\nfrom the old garment, it applies its tail to the densest part of the\r\ncarpet it had prepared at the start, and secures its hinder extremity by\r\nmeans of little hooks.\r\n\r\nBut what a change has now come over the creature! It is no longer a\r\ncaterpillar. Its head is no longer distinct, although we can readily\r\nmake out the positions of the eyes. Its mouth and jaws have quite\r\ndisappeared, and the legs and claspers are apparently gone. The three\r\nsegments that bore the legs are no longer distinctly separable, though\r\nin reality they still exist. The head and thorax are peculiarly shaped;\r\nand, instead of being cylindrical, are angled and ridged; but, beneath\r\nthe soft greenish skin--the new garment--we can discern the outline of\r\na pair of small wings, and see a proboscis and a pair of long antennae.\r\nAlso the six long legs of the future butterfly can be traced with care.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen is conical in form, coming to a sharp point at the end, and\r\nits segments are quite distinct.\r\n\r\nNo stranger to the metamorphoses of insects would connect the present\r\nform with that of a caterpillar; they are so very unlike. And yet the\r\ntime occupied in the whole change, from the spinning of the carpet, does\r\nnot occupy more than about thirty or thirty-five hours.\r\n\r\nThe apparent suddenness of this change is really surprising, but in\r\nreality the transformation is not nearly so sudden as it appears.\r\nDissection of a caterpillar a few days before the final moult is due\r\nwill show that the changes are already going on. In fact, a simple\r\nremoval of the skin will prove that the organs of the future butterfly\r\nare developing. Still, in proportion to the short time occupied, the\r\nchange is extremely great; and it may reasonably be inquired, Why so\r\ngreat a change within so short a space of time?--why is not the change\r\ncontinued steadily and equally through the larval existence? The reason\r\nhas already been hinted at. Caterpillars are living eating machines,\r\nwhose office is to remove excess of vegetable matter. Consequently they\r\nmust have their jaws and bulky digestive apparatus in full development\r\nto the end. If these organs were to _gradually_ disappear as the\r\ncaterpillar reaches its non-eating stages, it would simply be starved to\r\ndeath. So the change from the larval to the pupal state, which we may\r\nregard as the final moult of the caterpillar, is a far greater change\r\nthan any of the preceding ones, and occupies a proportionately longer\r\ntime, although it is principally confined to the last few days of the\r\ncaterpillar life.\r\n\r\nA number of caterpillars, and especially those of the butterflies,\r\nsuspend themselves when about to change; and the peculiarities of the\r\nmodes adopted must be left for our descriptions of species in a future\r\nchapter; but we will find room here for one more interesting example,\r\ntaking this time the larva of one of the commonest of the Vanessas (page\r\n166)--the Small Tortoiseshell Butterfly.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this insect are gregarious when young; and if ever\r\nyou meet with one, you are almost sure to be able to obtain a hundred or\r\nso without much searching. But as they grow older they feed singly, yet\r\ngenerally without straying very far from their birthplace.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown they sometimes stray to a neighbouring plant or fence to\r\nundergo the change to a chrysalis, but more commonly they are perfectly\r\nsatisfied with the protection afforded by the leaves of their food\r\nplant. We will now watch one of these as we did the larva of the Large\r\nWhite Butterfly.\r\n\r\nOf course the under side of the leaf is chosen. Here a silken carpet is\r\nspun as before described; but the caterpillar, instead of clinging with\r\n_all_ its claspers, suspends itself in a vertical position by its\r\nhindermost pair only.\r\n\r\nHere it hangs, head downwards, awaiting the coming events. The splitting\r\nand casting of the skin goes on just as in the case of the Large White,\r\nbut there is this puzzle to be solved: how can the insect shuffle itself\r\nout of its old coat without falling to the ground, leaving the cast-off\r\ngarments still hanging by the hooks of the claspers? This really seems a\r\nmatter of impossibility, since the little hooks which alone suspend the\r\ninsect are thrown off with the skin of the claspers.\r\n\r\nThe thing is managed in this way. As the skin slowly splits through the\r\nwrigglings of the apparently uncomfortable occupant, it is gradually\r\npushed backward--that is, upward--till it is in a shrivelled condition,\r\nand the body of the insect is nearly free. But the chrysalis thus\r\nbrought to light is provided with little hooks on the end of its 'tail'\r\nby which it can attach itself to the irregularities of the crumpled\r\ncoat. Its conical abdomen is also very flexible, and it can, by bending\r\nthis, seize hold of a ridge in the skin, holding it between the\r\nsegments. Thus, although practically quite free from the old garb, it\r\nnever falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere is now, however, another point to be attended to. The newly formed\r\nchrysalis desires to be entirely independent of its cast-off skin, and\r\nto suspend itself directly from the silky carpet it has prepared. To\r\nthis end it works steadily for a time, alternately bending its supple\r\nabdomen from side to side, gripping the folds of the skin between the\r\nsegments, pulling its body a little higher at each movement, and\r\nsecuring itself at each step by the little hooks at its extremity.\r\n\r\nSo it climbs, and at last it reaches the network of silk fibres, and\r\nthrusts the tip of its abdomen among them till some of the hooks have\r\ntaken hold. Not satisfied with this, it turns its body round and round\r\nto get the little hooks so entangled between the silk fibres that a fall\r\nis impossible, and in so doing it frequently pushes the old skin out of\r\nits place so that it falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the caterpillars of this species do not show any great\r\ngregarious tendency when nearly full fed, yet it is not an uncommon\r\nthing to find several hanging from the under surface of one leaf, all\r\nbeing attached to the one common carpet at which all had worked. And\r\nwhen bred in confinement, a number will often spin in company in a\r\ncorner of their cage. I have thus obtained a cluster of thirty-seven\r\npupae, all hanging by the 'tails' to the same mass of silk, which was so\r\nsmall that they formed quite a compact mass of beings with their tails\r\nclose together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--THE COCOON OF THE EMPEROR MOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--THE COCOON OF THE SIX-SPOTTED BURNET\r\n(_Filipendulae_).]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Large White Butterfly makes itself secure by a\r\nsilk band round its middle, while the 'Tortoiseshell' is fixed only by\r\nits tail. But the extra provision for the safety of the former is not so\r\nnecessary in the case of the latter, as it never spends more than two or\r\nthree weeks in the pupal state. Here it is the perfect insect that\r\nbraves the winter, and not the chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThere is a great variety in the means taken by the caterpillars of moths\r\nto protect themselves during their metamorphoses, but we shall have\r\nspace for only a few illustrations.\r\n\r\nA clever cocoon is spun by the larva of the Emperor Moth (_Pavonia_). It\r\nis pear-shaped, and composed of a brownish silk; and is so constructed\r\nthat the newly emerged moth can easily walk out of the small end without\r\nbreaking a fibre, while the entry of an insect enemy from without is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThis is managed as follows. A number of rather stiff threads are made to\r\nproject from the small end of the cocoon, and these converge as they\r\npass outward so that the ends are all near together. The other portions\r\nof the cocoon are of compact silk, and any insect intruder that ventures\r\nto enter by what we may almost term the _open_ end is met by a number of\r\nspikes, as it were, that play on it at every attempt. Many of these\r\nwonderful cocoons may be found during the winter months attached to the\r\nfood plants of this insect.\r\n\r\nOf the silken cocoons spun by various caterpillars some are so thin and\r\nlight that the chrysalis can easily be seen through them, and others are\r\nso densely woven as to be quite opaque. A great difference is also to be\r\nobserved in the adhesive power of the silk fibres. In some cases little\r\nthreads of silk can be pulled off the cocoon; but some of them, that of\r\nthe Oak Eggar (page 229) for example, look as if they had been\r\nconstructed of paper rather than of silk, because, at the time of\r\nspinning, the moist silk fibres stuck so closely together.\r\n\r\nAn extreme case of this character is to be met with in the cocoon of the\r\nPuss Moth (page 235); for here the fluid from the spinneret of the\r\ncaterpillar does not harden at once on exposure to air, and so the\r\nthreads become thoroughly united together, thus forming a solid gluey\r\ncocoon.\r\n\r\nWhen the Puss caterpillar is about to change, it descends the tree\r\n(poplar, willow, or sallow) till it is within a few feet of the ground.\r\nThen it commences gnawing away at the bark, at the same time cementing\r\nall the pieces together with the gluey substance from its spinning\r\nglands. In this way it surrounds itself with a very hard cocoon, which\r\nso closely resembles the surrounding bark in colour that detection is\r\ndifficult indeed.\r\n\r\nBut how will the caterpillar proceed if it is removed from its native\r\ntree and has no bark to gnaw? That you can easily answer for yourself,\r\nor rather Puss will answer it for you. Go and search among the poplars,\r\nwillows and sallows in the month of July. You may possibly come across a\r\ncaterpillar that is just in the act of creeping down the bark in search\r\nof a resting place; but if not you may be successful in obtaining a few\r\neither by examining the twigs, or you may start them from their hiding\r\nplaces by smartly tapping the smaller branches with a strong stick.\r\n\r\nHaving secured one or more larvae, take them home, and they will give\r\nsome rather novel performances. If they are not fully grown, you must\r\nsupply them with fresh leaves every day till they refuse to eat; and\r\nthen is the time for your experiments. Shut one in a little wooden box,\r\nand you will have the pleasure of watching it construct a cocoon of\r\nchips of wood that it has bitten out with its powerful jaws, all joined\r\ntogether into a hard shell by means of transparent glue. Shut another\r\nPuss in a glass vessel--a tumbler, for instance--either by placing it\r\nunder the inverted vessel, or by covering over the top. Perhaps it will\r\nnot be superfluous to mention that, should you place it under an\r\ninverted vessel, this vessel should not stand on a polished table, for,\r\nwhatever be the material, unless _extremely_ hard, it is sure to be\r\nutilised in the manufacture of the cocoon.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, then, that the caterpillar is under an inverted tumbler\r\nthat stands on a plate or saucer. Now it is for _you_ to decide what\r\nmaterial shall be used in the construction of the new home. Give Puss\r\nsome fine strips of brightly coloured ribbon, and it will construct a\r\nvery gaudy house by gluing them together. Or, provide it with sawdust,\r\npieces of rag, glass beads, sand, paper, anything in fact; and the\r\nmaterial will be 'made up' into a cocoon more or less ornamental\r\naccording to the nature of the supply.\r\n\r\nBut what if you give it _nothing_ with which to work, and so inclose it\r\nthat nothing its jaws can pierce is within its reach? For instance, shut\r\nit in with tumbler and saucer as before, inverting the former on the\r\nlatter, and give it no material whatever. What will it do now? We will\r\nwatch and see.\r\n\r\nAt first it is very restless, and walks round and round the edge of the\r\ntumbler, evidently a little dissatisfied with the prospects. Then, after\r\na little while, the events of nature transpiring in their fixed order\r\nregardless of trivial mishaps, the glutinous fluid begins to flow from\r\nthe creature's spinning glands, and it moves about in a somewhat aimless\r\nfashion, applying the transparent adhesive matter both to tumbler and\r\nsaucer.\r\n\r\nIt seems now to become a little more reconciled to its unnatural\r\nsurroundings; and, making the best of bad matters, keeps its body in one\r\nplace, and starts the construction of a ridge or barrier all round\r\nitself. By the continued application of the creature's spinneret this\r\nbarrier is made gradually thicker and higher, till at last the\r\noverhanging sides meet and the caterpillar is inclosed in its\r\nself-constructed prison. But the walls of this prison are so transparent\r\nthat every movement can be watched; and, after the insect has spent a\r\nfew days in completing the cocoon, we can see it cast off its old skin,\r\nand appear in the new garb of a fine greenish chrysalis.\r\n\r\nIts soft green skin soon hardens and turns to a rich dark brown colour,\r\nand it settles down for a long rest lasting till the following May or\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole operation of building is completed, lift up the tumbler,\r\nand up will come the saucer too. The two are firmly glued together by\r\nthe substance secreted; and the power of this as a cementing material\r\nwill be well illustrated if you endeavour by mere pulling force to\r\nseparate the two articles.\r\n\r\nThe Puss is not the only caterpillar that works up a foreign material\r\nwith the contents of the spinning organs. There are several others, in\r\nfact, that use for this purpose fragments of wood or other parts of the\r\nfood plants; and a still larger number bind together leaves, fresh or\r\ndead, or particles of earth or other matter. Several such cocoons will\r\nbe described in our accounts of individual species in another chapter.\r\nWe shall now devote a little space to a few general remarks on the\r\nchrysalides and the final metamorphosis of butterflies and moths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_THE PUPA OR CHRYSALIS_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last moult of the caterpillar is over, the chrysalis that\r\nhad already been developing under the cover of the old skin is exposed\r\nto full view; and although the perfect insect is not to be liberated for\r\nsome time to come, yet some of its parts are apparently fully formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--THE PUPA OF THE PRIVET HAWK (_Ligustri_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--THE CHRYSALIS OF THE LARGE WHITE BUTTERFLY\r\n(_Brassicae_).]\r\n\r\nThe newly exposed skin of the chrysalis is very soft and moist, but as\r\nit hardens it forms a membranous or horny covering that protects and\r\nholds firmly in place the trunk and the various limbs and appendages\r\nthat are distinctly to be traced on the under surface.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you examine a chrysalis directly after the moult is over,\r\nyou will often find that the wings, antennae, proboscis, and legs of the\r\nfuture butterfly can be easily separated from the trunk of the body on\r\nwhich they lie by means of a blunt needle, and can be spread out so as\r\nto be quite free from that surface.\r\n\r\nIn form the chrysalides of butterflies and moths are as variable as the\r\ncaterpillars. Many of the former are sharply angular like that of the\r\n'Small Tortoiseshell' already mentioned; but some of the\r\nbutterflies--the Skippers (page 197)--have smooth and tapering\r\nchrysalides, and so have most of the moths.\r\n\r\nIn colour they are equally variable. Some are beautifully tinted with\r\ndelicate shades of green, some spotted on a light ground, some striped\r\nwith bands more or less gaudy and distinct, but the prevailing tint,\r\nespecially among the moths, is a reddish brown, often so deep that it is\r\nalmost a black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--THE PUPA OF THE DARK GREEN FRITILLARY\r\n(_Aglaia_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--THE PUPA OF THE BLACK-VEINED WHITE BUTTERFLY\r\n(_Crataegi_).]\r\n\r\nAs a rule there is no marked resemblance between the different stages of\r\nthe same insect. Thus, a brilliantly coloured caterpillar may change to\r\na dull and unattractive chrysalis, from which may emerge a butterfly or\r\nmoth that partakes of the colours of neither. But in a few cases there\r\n_are_ colours or other features that remain persistent throughout the\r\nthree stages, or show themselves prominently in two.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example in point is that of the Magpie or Currant Moth\r\n(page 279). The caterpillar of this moth is cream-coloured, with orange\r\nstripes along the sides, and very bold black markings down the back. The\r\nchrysalis, which is at first entirely yellow, afterwards turns black\r\nwith the exception of some yellow transverse bands. Then, the moth\r\nexhibits the same colours as these two earlier stages, with the same\r\ndegree of boldness; for its pale cream-coloured wings, tinted with\r\npatches of yellow, are marked with numerous deep black spots. Thus, in\r\nthis case, we find the same general character of the colouring\r\nthroughout the insect's existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--THE PUPA OF THE CURRANT MOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--PUPA OF THE PALE TUSSOCK MOTH (_Pudibunda_).]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting example, though not so striking as the last, is to\r\nbe found in the case of a group of moths known as the _Liparidae_. The\r\ncaterpillars of these are remarkable for their very hairy bodies, often\r\nornamented by several bold brush-like tufts. The chrysalides are also\r\nhairy; and several of the moths themselves are not only thickly clad\r\nwith shaggy hair, but a bold tuft often tips the abdomen.\r\n\r\nWe must not leave these few remarks on the characters of chrysalides\r\nwithout a mention of the brilliant spots of burnished gold that decorate\r\nthe pupae of certain butterflies. This is the feature that led to the\r\ninvention of the term _chrysalis_, which is derived from the Greek word\r\n_chrysos_, meaning _gold_. For the same reason the term _aurelia_ has\r\nbeen applied to the pupae of _Lepidoptera_, this being derived from\r\n_aurum_--the Latin name for gold.\r\n\r\nStrictly, then, these two terms apply only to the pupae of a certain\r\nnumber of the butterflies; but the former is now generally used to\r\ndesignate the pupae of all the _Lepidoptera_, and is even extended to the\r\ncorresponding stages of insects of other orders.\r\n\r\nIf you examine one of these gold-speckled chrysalides, the brilliant\r\nmetallic lustre seems to belong to the outer surface, just as if certain\r\nspots had been tipped with real gold; but after the butterfly has\r\nquitted its case the beautiful golden spots are gone. This proves that\r\nthe metallic appearance is not due to reflection from the outer surface\r\nof the chrysalis, but to a reflection from some structure beneath it.\r\nThis latter is a very thin membrane which lies just under the outer\r\ntransparent covering of the chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe period during which the _Lepidoptera_ remain in the chrysalis state\r\nvaries very considerably in different species, and also depends more or\r\nless on the temperature. As a rule, when a caterpillar pupates before\r\nthe end of the summer, it remains dormant in the pupal condition for\r\nonly a few weeks; but, if late in the summer or in the autumn, it\r\nremains in this condition throughout the winter, and emerges in the\r\nfollowing spring or early summer.\r\n\r\nBoth these conditions are illustrated in the life history of the Large\r\nWhite or Cabbage Butterfly--an insect with which we have already become\r\nacquainted. We get two distinct broods of this butterfly every year, the\r\nfirst appearing in May and the second in August. The eggs of the first\r\nbrood hatch in about a fortnight, and the larvae are full grown about\r\nfour weeks later. These then change to chrysalides, from which the\r\nperfect insects (the second brood) emerge in a few weeks--the period\r\nvarying slightly with the temperature of the season. From the eggs of\r\nthis second brood we get another invading army of cabbage eaters that\r\nchange to pupae late in the summer. These remain dormant till the\r\nfollowing April, and may be found in numbers throughout the winter,\r\nattached to the walls and fences of kitchen and market gardens.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the pupae of the same species are so influenced by the\r\ntemperatures of the seasons, can we limit or prolong the period of\r\nquiescence by subjecting them to high or low temperatures artificially\r\nproduced? Most certainly we can; and every practical entomologist knows\r\nhow to obtain the perfect butterflies and moths of certain species long\r\nbefore their appointed times, or, if he desires it, to compel them to\r\nremain in their dormant stage long after the natural period has\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nSometimes an enthusiastic insect hunter obtains a large number of what\r\nwe may term 'winter pupae,' by collecting and breeding various species.\r\nHe also anticipates a number of successful captures of perfect insects\r\nduring the following summer. Thus, from two distinct sources, he obtains\r\na goodly assortment of butterflies and moths, the setting, preserving,\r\nand arranging of which entails an immense amount of home work.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances he will sometimes endeavour to cause some of\r\nhis pupae to emerge before their accustomed time, so that he may get some\r\nof his insects 'on the boards' before his field work is in full swing,\r\nand so avoid a rush, or prevent the loss of insects that will be spoiled\r\nbefore he has time to take them in hand.\r\n\r\nThis process of hurrying up his pupae he calls 'forcing,' and simply\r\nconsists in keeping them for a time in a warm room or hothouse where the\r\nhigh temperature is pretty constant.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the entomologist may desire to try the effect of a\r\ncontinued _low_ temperature on his pupae. This he can do by placing his\r\npupae in an ice house. Such experiments have often been performed, and\r\nthe results are very interesting. In some cases the emergence of the\r\nperfect insect has been delayed for many months, and even years; and\r\nthen, after an exposure to a normal temperature lasting only a week or\r\ntwo, the winged insect has made its appearance just as if nothing\r\nunusual had happened.\r\n\r\nSuch are the effects of _extreme_ temperatures on the duration of the\r\nchrysalis state; and we naturally infer, from such results, that the\r\npupa under natural conditions is influenced, though in a lesser degree,\r\nby the variations experienced with the seasons, especially in such a\r\nfickle climate as our own.\r\n\r\nThe insect hunter has always to bear this in mind, and particularly so\r\nwhen he sets out on a search for certain desired species. Suppose, for\r\nexample, he has set his mind on the capture of a certain butterfly that\r\n_usually_ appears in the _first_ week in May. Before finally naming the\r\nday, he has to consider what the weather has been during the last few\r\nweeks, and if he finds that this has been much warmer than the average\r\nfor the corresponding periods in the past, he selects a day in _April_,\r\nearlier or later according to the difference between the present season\r\nand the average.\r\n\r\nIf he does not pay due attention to such considerations, he will\r\nsometimes find that all the insects netted are shabby and much worn,\r\neven though, under average conditions, he would be catching newly\r\nemerged and brilliant specimens. This, then, will explain how it is that\r\nwe so often see in entomologists' periodicals startling accounts of\r\n'early captures,' and of the appearance of certain insects late in the\r\nseason that _ought_ not to have emerged till the following summer.\r\n\r\nI will give just one illustration of these variations. The beautiful\r\nOrange Tip Butterfly (Plate I, fig. 7) generally appears about the\r\nmiddle of May in the southern counties. Farther north it is of course a\r\nlittle later. In the north of England it has been taken in June; and in\r\nScotland as late as July. On the other hand, I have taken it in\r\nGloucestershire as early as March, on a rather bleak day with a cold\r\neast wind; and, withal, in a field on the slope of the Cotswolds fully\r\nexposed to the unfavourable breeze; but it was evident that, in this\r\ncase, the butterfly had been enticed from its winter quarters by the\r\nmilder weather of the few previous weeks.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well, in passing, to observe that it is not only the pupa\r\nthat is influenced by temperature. The hatching of eggs may be forced by\r\nhigh temperatures, or be retarded by exposure to cold; and in nature the\r\nperiod of incubation varies with the seasons. The larvae, too, grow\r\nfaster or more slowly, or pupate earlier or later from similar causes.\r\nAnd so no very definite date or period can be assigned to any one stage\r\nof any insect.\r\n\r\nNow let us return to one of the chrysalides that we have already watched\r\nthrough the earlier stages of its existence, and follow it in its future\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIt is now, as we say, in its quiescent or dormant condition, but we must\r\nnot suppose that it is always in a profound sleep, nor can we say that\r\nit is insensible to its surroundings. Touch it gently or surprise it\r\nwith a puff of air from your mouth, and it will begin to wag its pointed\r\ntail, sometimes with such vigour as to send the body rolling round and\r\nround in its box. Lay it on a bed of cocoa-nut fibre or finely sifted\r\nsoil and let it remain _quite undisturbed_ for a few hours or days, and\r\nyou will probably find that, by occasional movements of its body, it has\r\nmade a slight depression in its bed, and lies partly submerged. I have\r\nknown some chrysalides to completely bury themselves in this way during\r\nthe course of a day or two, and others to partly expose themselves after\r\nhaving been lightly covered. Others again, I have observed, will move\r\nsmartly if a strong light is suddenly turned on them. Many, too,\r\ncertainly appear to have a strong objection to exposure to the direct\r\nrays of a hot sun; for, when thus exposed, they will struggle\r\npersistently, as if to work their bodies into some shady corner. I would\r\nnot advise a young entomologist to try this experiment, however, if he\r\nvalues the pupae he possesses, for direct sunlight is undoubtedly very\r\nharmful to many species, and perhaps it is to all.\r\n\r\nSome chrysalides are not nearly so active as has just been represented;\r\nin fact, there are many which seem to show no signs of life during the\r\ngreater part of the time spent in that state. But in all, whether\r\napparently active or not, certain important internal changes are at\r\nwork. We have already noticed that, even in the last days of the\r\n_larval_ existence, some of the organs of the future imago are to be\r\ntraced. But these are as yet imperfectly developed. We have also\r\nobserved that a continuation of these changes, gradually carried on,\r\nwould be impossible in a voracious feeder; so the insect, now fully\r\ngrown, and no longer requiring a supply of food, settles down in perfect\r\nquiet, submitting itself quite passively to any further changes that\r\nnature may demand.\r\n\r\nIt has already suffered the loss of its claspers. Its wonderful jaws\r\nthat did so much damage (for good or evil as the case may be) to the\r\nvegetable world are now gone, and the bulky digestive apparatus has\r\nrapidly dwindled to useless dimensions. These and other changes, already\r\nin progress, have to be perfected while the creature is in a restful and\r\nhelpless condition, though they may often be retarded or even suspended\r\nduring cold weather when progress would certainly bring it to an\r\nuntimely end.\r\n\r\nBut now the grandest of all these transformation scenes is nigh at hand.\r\nThe protective skin is already loosening from the almost perfect imago,\r\nand consequently feels softer and far more yielding than it did when in\r\nclose contact with the body: the swaddled butterfly or moth (for such\r\nthe pupa is) is slowly preparing to throw off its imprisoning garb. The\r\nwings and large compound eyes are assuming their final colours, which\r\nnow begin to show themselves through the more or less transparent skin,\r\nand the long legs, the perfectly formed antennae, and the slender\r\nproboscis, all of which are folded closely under the creature's thorax,\r\nnow begin to move within their loosened sheaths.\r\n\r\nNow let us watch it closely, for one of the most wonderful sights ever\r\nwitnessed by a naturalist is about to be presented to our view. We think\r\nwe can observe slight movements; and, it may be, we can actually see the\r\nstruggling insect endeavouring to set itself free. The legs and\r\nproboscis are moving within the loosened skin; and lo! as we watch these\r\nmotions, the prison wall bursts with a slight snapping noise (at least,\r\nsuch is the case with some of the larger species), and in a moment out\r\npop a few long legs which immediately struggle for a foothold. The\r\nproboscis also appears, alternately lengthening itself out and coiling\r\ninto a spiral, as if impatient to reach the sweet nectar from the bottom\r\nof some fragrant flower cup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36--A BUTTERFLY, JUST AFTER EMERGING.]\r\n\r\nAll this takes place in less time than one requires to describe it; and,\r\nbefore many seconds have passed, the struggling insect has quite\r\ncompleted its last moult, and is bidding good-bye to the rent garment\r\nthat has done it good service for so long a time.\r\n\r\nBut how dreadfully disappointing! Did we not say only a few minutes\r\nsince, that a beautiful butterfly or moth was about to emerge? How,\r\nthen, is this? Here is an odd-looking creature, such as we have never\r\nseen before! True, it has the right kind of body, though even that is so\r\nsoft and heavy that it is fairly dragged along as the insect walks. Its\r\nantennae, too, seem to be just the right thing--that is, just what we\r\nwere expecting to see. But oh! the wings! Are we looking at a\r\ndeformity?--a failure on the part of Nature to produce what she ought?\r\n\r\nWe will not judge hastily, but continue to watch it a little longer. It\r\nseems very restless at first, and, with the fluttering apologies for\r\nwings, drags its heavy body along till it reaches some surface up which\r\nit can climb. If nothing of the kind is close at hand you may place a\r\n_rough_ upright stick in its path, and it will immediately begin to\r\nascend. Its motto is now 'Excelsior!' and its ambition to rise may be so\r\ngreat that, on reaching the very top of the stick provided for it, it\r\nstruggles for a still higher position in life till, failing to get a\r\nfoothold in the air itself, it falls to the ground and has to retrace\r\nits steps.\r\n\r\nI once thought I would like to test the perseverance of a large moth in\r\nperforming its first upward journey; and as it was one from a chrysalis\r\nto be found in nature at the foot of a tree that attains some\r\nconsiderable height, I was, of course, prepared to exercise a little\r\npatience myself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the moth had emerged, I placed it at the bottom of a window\r\ncurtain that hung from about eight feet high to the floor. In less than\r\nhalf a minute it had reached the top, and was struggling hard to get\r\nstill higher. I took it down, and again placed it at the bottom. Up it\r\nwent as fast as before; and this was repeated nine times with exactly\r\nthe same result. For the tenth time I placed the persevering creature at\r\nthe bottom of the curtain; and, after it had walked about halfway up, it\r\n_suddenly_ stopped, apparently quite satisfied with having travelled a\r\ndistance of over seventy feet in an upward direction. Its six legs were\r\nimmediately arranged symmetrically in a business-like manner, and there\r\nit settled quite still, as if it had some definite object in stopping\r\njust exactly in that spot.\r\n\r\nBut we must now return to our own insect, which has by this time settled\r\nitself in a similar manner on the stick we provided for it. The peculiar\r\norgans which represent the wings, though so very small, show distinctly,\r\nin miniature, the colour and pattern of the fully developed wings of the\r\nspecies. An interesting change is just now commencing. These wings are\r\napparently growing larger, but the development is very unequal, so that\r\nthey become curled and crumpled till they are even more unsightly than\r\nbefore. All seems to be going amiss. But this lasts only for a short\r\ntime. The fluid from the body steadily rushes into the _nervures_,\r\ncausing the wings to expand, and in a few minutes the beautiful pinions\r\nare stretched to the full extent, assume their normal shape, and expose\r\nthe full glory of their brilliant colours.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting if I give an example showing the exact time taken\r\nfor the full development of the wings of a certain insect. So I will\r\nhere quote an entry from my note book; and, by the way, let me strongly\r\nadvise all my young readers who follow up this subject to habitually\r\nenter in a book kept specially for the purpose all facts which strike\r\nthem as they pursue their study of nature. The note to which I refer\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\n'Early on the evening of the 22nd [April] I selected a few chrysalides\r\nof Populi [the Poplar Hawk Moth, page 209] which, from the looseness of\r\ntheir cases, were thought to be just on the point of emerging. At 8.46\r\none of them showed signs of restlessness; and, after a few vigorous\r\nmovements, during which it rolled itself over on the glass [I had placed\r\nthe pupae on a piece of plate glass so that slight movements might be\r\nmore easily detected], the front of its case was suddenly thrust off\r\nwith considerable force; and in _less than four seconds_ the imago was\r\nquite free and crawling on the table. After trying hard to reach a\r\nhigher point than was provided for about four minutes, it rested to\r\nexpand its wings--now about seven-sixteenths of an inch long, or\r\none-third the total length of the body. At 9 o'clock the wings reached\r\nhalf the length of the body, and were much curled. At 9.12 they were\r\nfully expanded and straightened out.'\r\n\r\nFrom this extract we see that the whole period from the bursting of the\r\ncase to the full expansion of the wings was only twenty-six minutes; and\r\nit will be well to remind the reader that the process occupies even a\r\nmuch shorter time than this with many species, both of butterflies and\r\nmoths. It will be observed, also, that the _evening_ was chosen as the\r\ntime for the observation. There was a reason for this. The Poplar Hawk\r\nMoth, as is the case with many others, almost invariably emerges from\r\nthe chrysalis in the evening--usually after dark. But it may be\r\nmentioned in passing that a far larger number of the _Lepidoptera_ as\r\ninvariably emerge in the morning.\r\n\r\nAgain we will return to our newly emerged insect, for there are still\r\none or two interesting points to observe. The wings have fully expanded,\r\nit is true, but how very limp they are! Take the creature on the tip of\r\nyour finger and hold it so that its body is in a horizontal position.\r\nImmediately the wings bend downward with their own weight, so soft and\r\nflexible are they. The body, too, is still very soft, and apparently\r\nmuch too heavy for flight. Then, if you place it on a flat surface, it\r\nwill immediately try to find some perpendicular or overhanging surface\r\nfrom which it can suspend itself by means of its legs, so that the\r\npendant and straightened wings are in the best possible position for\r\ndrying. As the insect walks away in search of such a resting place, the\r\nbody still drags as it did before, and the wings bend over, either both\r\non one side or one on each side of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is some time before the wings are sufficiently dry and rigid for\r\nflight, but the period varies greatly with different species. Some of\r\nthe small butterflies and moths take to flight long before an hour has\r\npassed, but in many cases several hours elapse before the creature\r\nstarts from its first resting place. Butterflies that emerge in the\r\nmorning spend their first day actively on the wing; but the nocturnal\r\nmoths that emerge early in the day do not fly till evening twilight.\r\nWhen, however, the time arrives, the insect flutters its wings as if to\r\ntest their power before committing itself to the air; and frequently,\r\nafter only a few seconds spent in this preparatory exercise, off it\r\ndarts with astonishing rapidity. But others seem far more cautious. They\r\nvibrate their wings, sometimes with such rapidity that they are lost in\r\na kind of mist, and with such power that their bodies would be carried\r\nsuddenly into the air were they not firmly anchored by three pairs of\r\nhooked claws. Then, continuing the rapid vibration, they move slowly\r\nalong, always holding on firmly by one or more legs, as if to still\r\nfurther satisfy themselves concerning the efficiency of their wings.\r\nThen they venture on a few short trial trips from one neighbouring\r\nobject to another, and at last gain sufficient confidence for a long\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nHow strange must be the feelings of a winged insect during its first\r\nflight! After a long period during which it was a helpless, crawling\r\ngrub, and this followed by a term of imprisonment during which it was\r\nalmost or quite shut off from the world, it now suddenly acquires such\r\ngreat powers of locomotion that it is often a match for ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! this life is short. A few days spent in sporting with those\r\nit meets and in sucking the sweet juices of many flowers; then a day or\r\ntwo during which the female deposits its eggs; again a few days employed\r\nin pleasures that become less and less attractive, till, at last, the\r\ncreature becomes weary of life and settles down to die.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the complete life history of the _Lepidoptera_ from\r\nthe egg to the perfect insect, avoiding descriptions that apply only to\r\ncertain species as far as possible, excepting where such are useful as\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing more remains to be done before we start in real earnest\r\nwith our practical work. We shall shortly be giving hints on the modes\r\nof capture, the 'setting' and the preservation of butterflies and moths.\r\nAnd in so doing we shall often have to observe important points in which\r\nour dealings with these two great divisions of the order will differ\r\nvery materially. Hence we must not consider ourselves ready to proceed\r\nwith the practical portion of the entomologist's labours till we are\r\nperfectly satisfied that we know the main features that enable us to\r\ndistinguish between the butterflies and the moths, and also know just a\r\nlittle concerning the subdivisions on each side.\r\n\r\nThis, then, shall form the subject of the next short chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEPIDOPTERA_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidoptera_ are divided into two very unequal groups, to which we\r\nhave so frequently alluded as 'Butterflies' and 'Moths.' And, although\r\nthese two terms are popularly applied in a fairly accurate manner, yet,\r\nstrange to say, very few persons indeed have any definite knowledge of\r\nthe differences that entomologists recognise between the two groups.\r\n\r\nEvery entomologist has his circle of sympathetic and, perhaps, even\r\nadmiring friends. Consequently, many a little package is sent round to\r\nhis abode 'with great care,' accompanied by a note or a message\r\nconcerning the fine 'butterfly I have just caught, and thought you would\r\nlike to add to your collection.'\r\n\r\nThe 'butterflies' that so frequently reach us through these channels\r\nnearly always turn out to be _brightly coloured_ moths, and this\r\nnaturally gives one the idea that the popular notion as to the\r\nclassification of the _Lepidoptera_ is based on colour or brilliancy of\r\ndesign, the term 'butterfly' being applied to the gayer species, and\r\n'moth' to the more dingy members of the race.\r\n\r\nThere is really some shadow of a reason in this method of nomenclature,\r\nfor butterflies _are usually_ more brightly clad than moths; but the\r\nscientific classification, at least as far as the main divisions and\r\nsubdivisions are concerned, has nothing whatever to do with colour or\r\ndesign; and we must at once acquaint ourselves with the fact that there\r\n_are_ very dingy butterflies, and most beautiful and highly coloured\r\nmoths.\r\n\r\nHow shall we account for the fact that the specimens so kindly sent us\r\nby our friends are generally moths? Is it because moths are more\r\nnumerous and more frequently seen? They are certainly more numerous;\r\nfor, while our butterflies do not number seventy species, the other\r\ndivision contains about two thousand. Yet, in spite of this fact, moths\r\nare not generally observed as much as butterflies, for the former are\r\nnearly all night-fliers, and the latter _always_ fly by day and rest by\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nStill our question remains unanswered. The reason is this. The captives\r\nsent us are seldom caught on the wing. Most of our grown-up friends,\r\neven though they admire our own pluck and general carelessness\r\nconcerning the remarks of the spectators of our entomological antics,\r\nwould not themselves like to be seen, hat in hand, chasing a butterfly;\r\nand the night-flying moths are, of course, less frequently observed. But\r\nthey often, in the course of their daily employments, meet with a large\r\nmoth fast asleep in some corner of a dwelling house, workshop, or\r\nouthouse. Such moths are easily caught while in the midst of their\r\nslumbers, and, as they often make no attempt to fly by day, are as\r\neasily transferred to a box suitable for transmission by messenger or by\r\npost.\r\n\r\nIn the above few remarks we have alluded to some features by which the\r\ntwo great groups of the _Lepidoptera_ may be distinguished; but we have\r\nalready referred (page 5) to a far more important one in our description\r\nof the various forms of antennae. All butterflies--at least all _British_\r\nbutterflies--have knobbed or clubbed antennae, while the corresponding\r\norgans of all our moths terminate in a sharp point.\r\n\r\nThis distinction obtains in all British _Lepidoptera_, and is so far\r\nregarded as the most important basis of classification that naturalists\r\nhave derived from it the two Greek terms that are synonymous with our\r\ntwo popular names--butterflies and moths. The scientific name for the\r\nformer group is _Rhopalocera_--a term derived from two Greek words, one\r\nsignifying a horn, and the other a club, and thus meaning 'club-horned.'\r\nThe corresponding name for moths is _Heterocera_, derived from the same\r\nsource, and meaning 'variously horned.'\r\n\r\nBut, although we find embodied in these two long and formidable names an\r\nunerring mark of distinction between British butterflies and moths, we\r\nmust not neglect other less important facts which, though less\r\ndistinctive, are not without interest.\r\n\r\nObserve a butterfly at rest. Its wings are turned vertically over its\r\nback, and brought so closely together that they often touch. In this\r\nposition the 'upper' surfaces of the 'upper' wings are completely hidden\r\nfrom view, and the 'under' surfaces are exposed on the two sides,\r\nexcept that those of the 'upper' pair are partly hidden by the other\r\npair.\r\n\r\nNow look at a moth under the same circumstances, and you will generally\r\nfind the wings lying over its body, which is almost or completely hidden\r\nbeneath them. As a rule the upper pair together form a triangular\r\nfigure, and entirely cover the second pair; but in some cases a portion\r\nof each of the under wings extends beyond the margin of those above\r\nthem, and in others the upper pair extend so far forward that nearly the\r\nwhole of the under wings is exposed behind them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--A BUTTERFLY AT REST (LARGE COPPER).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--A MOTH AT REST (GOTHIC).]\r\n\r\nAgain, the wings of butterflies are so rigid that they can never be\r\nfolded; but you will observe that the under wings of moths are generally\r\nvery thin, soft, and pliant, and are neatly pleated lengthwise when not\r\nin use.\r\n\r\nAnother feature deserving notice is a slight difference to be often\r\nobserved in the form of the body. The butterfly, which generally has a\r\nslender body, has a distinct constriction or waist between the thorax\r\nand abdomen. This is not so apparent with moths, and especially with the\r\nthick-bodied species.\r\n\r\nThe _Rhopalocera_ or Butterflies are divided into _Families_, each of\r\nwhich contains insects that possess certain features in common by which\r\nthey may all be distinguished from the members of any other family.\r\n\r\nThe British species represent eight families. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Papilionidae._--Containing only one British species--the beautiful\r\nSwallow-tail (Plate I, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n2. _Pieridae._--Containing ten species. These are often known\r\ncollectively as the 'Whites,' but include four butterflies that are\r\ndistinguished by beautiful shades of yellow and orange.\r\n\r\n3. _Nymphalidae._--This family contains seventeen insects, among them\r\nbeing several splendid species. It includes the Fritillaries and\r\nVanessas.\r\n\r\n4. _Apaturidae._--Of this we have only one representative--the Purple\r\nEmperor (Plate V, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n5. _Satyridae._--Including the 'Browns' and 'Heaths,' and numbering\r\neleven species.\r\n\r\n6. _Lycaenidae._--Including the Hairstreaks, 'Coppers,' and 'Blues,' in\r\nall seventeen species.\r\n\r\n7. _Erycinidae._--Containing only the 'Duke of Burgundy.'\r\n\r\n8. _Hesperiidae._--This family contains seven British butterflies\r\ncommonly known as the 'Skippers.'\r\n\r\nAlthough all the members of the same family resemble each other in\r\ncertain points of structure, or in their habits, yet we can often find\r\namong them a smaller group differing from all the others in one or two\r\nminor particulars. Such smaller groups are called _Genera_.\r\n\r\nTo make this all quite clear we will take an example.\r\n\r\nThe Brimstone Butterfly (Plate II, fig. 4) belongs to the second\r\nfamily--_Pieridae_, _all_ the members of which are distinguished from\r\nthose of the other families by the characteristics mentioned on page\r\n141.\r\n\r\nBut our Brimstone Butterfly possesses another very prominent feature in\r\nwhich it differs from all the other British _Pieridae_, and that is the\r\nconspicuous projecting angles of both fore and hind wings. Among the\r\nforeign species of the family we are considering there are several that\r\npossess these angles; but as there are no others among our own members,\r\nthe 'Brimstone' is placed by itself in the list of British _Lepidoptera_\r\nas the only member of the genus _Gonopteryx_ or 'angle-winged'\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nThus the full relationship of this butterfly to other insects may be\r\nshown in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  _The Brimstone Butterfly._\r\n\r\n  =ORDER.=--_Lepidoptera_\r\n  =Section.=--_Rhopalocera_\r\n  FAMILY.--_Pieridae_\r\n  _Genus._--_Gonopteryx_\r\n  Species.--_Rhamni_\r\n\r\nNow, every butterfly has a Latin or Greek name in addition to that by\r\nwhich it is popularly known. I should have said _two_ Latin or Greek\r\nnames. The first of these is always the _generic_ name, and the second\r\nis the one by which we denote the particular member or _species_ of that\r\ngenus. Thus, the scientific name of the Brimstone Butterfly is\r\n_Gonopteryx Rhamni_.\r\n\r\n'But,' the reader may be inclined to ask, 'why should we not be\r\nsatisfied with the one popular name only?' And, 'If we _must_ have a\r\nseparate scientific name, could we not find suitable terms among our\r\nEnglish words to build up such a name--one that might express the\r\nprincipal characteristics of the insect, and also serve all the purposes\r\nof classification?'\r\n\r\nSuch questions sound very reasonable, and so they are. But the\r\nentomologist's answer is this. We ourselves may get on well without the\r\nhelp of the dead languages, but we have brother naturalists all over the\r\nworld, speaking a great variety of different languages. We endeavour to\r\nhelp one another--to exchange notes and generally to assist one another\r\nin our labours; and this can be greatly facilitated if we all adopt the\r\nsame system of nomenclature. The educated of most of the great nations\r\ngenerally know something of Latin and Greek, and consequently the\r\nadoption of these languages is generally acceptable to all.\r\n\r\nThis sounds well, but for my own part I believe that if we are to make\r\nany branch of natural history a popular study, especially with the\r\nyoung, we must to a certain extent avoid anything that may prove\r\ndistasteful. There is no doubt whatever that many a youngster has been\r\nturned away from the pursuit of the study of nature by the formidable\r\narray of almost unpronounceable names that stretch nearly halfway across\r\na page; and those who desire to make such a study pleasant to beginners\r\nshould be very cautious with the use of these necessary evils. One would\r\nthink, on glancing over some of the scientific manuals that are written\r\n'especially for the young,' that the authors considered our own too mean\r\na language for so exalted a purpose, for in such works we find all or\r\nnearly all the popular names by which the schoolboy knows certain\r\ncreatures he has seen entirely omitted, and the description of a species\r\nappended to a long Latin term that conveys no idea whatever to the\r\nreader, who is studying the description of a well-known animal or plant\r\nand doesn't know it.\r\n\r\nOur plan will be to give the popular names throughout, except in the\r\ncase of those few species that are not so well known as to have\r\nreceived one; but the scientific names will always be given as well for\r\nthe benefit of those readers who would like to know them. And the short\r\ndescription of the method of classification just given will enable the\r\nmore ambitious of my readers to thoroughly understand the table of\r\nBritish butterflies and moths toward the end of the book.\r\n\r\nThis table includes _all_ the British species of butterflies and of the\r\nlarger moths; and the arrangement is such as to show clearly the\r\ndivisions into sections, families, &c. It will therefore be of great\r\nvalue for reference, and as a guide for the arrangement of the specimens\r\nin the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing description of the method of classification butterflies\r\nonly are mentioned; but the division and arrangement of moths is carried\r\nout in just the same manner except that the system is a little more\r\ncomplicated. The number of moths is so large in comparison, that we are\r\nable to select from them some very large groups the species of which\r\npossess features in common. These groups are termed _tribes_, and are\r\nagain divided into families just like the butterflies. Thus the\r\narrangement of moths includes _tribes_, _families_, _genera_ and\r\n_species_. We will take an example by way of illustration as we did\r\nbefore, and ask the reader to verify the same by comparison with our\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  _Example._--The 'Common Tiger' (Plate X, fig. 3).\r\n\r\n  =ORDER.=--_Lepidoptera_\r\n  =Section.=--_Heterocera_\r\n  TRIBE.--_Bombyces_\r\n  FAMILY.--_Cheloniidae_\r\n  _Genus._--_Arctia_\r\n  Species.--_Caia_\r\n  Scientific Name.--_Arctia Caia._\r\n\r\nI have already said that the Latin and Greek names of butterflies and\r\nmoths are not at all necessary to the young entomologist. It is quite\r\npossible to be well acquainted with the natural history of these\r\ncreatures, and to derive all the pleasure and benefits that the study of\r\nthem can afford without the knowledge of such names; but most\r\nentomologists go in for them, often to the entire exclusion of the\r\npopular English terms.\r\n\r\nThere are those who consider themselves (or would have us consider them)\r\nexpert entomologists because they have the power to vomit forth a long\r\nlist of scientific names of butterflies and moths which (to them) have\r\nno meaning whatever; and it is astonishing that we meet with so many\r\nyoungsters who can rattle away such terms, and, at the same time, are\r\ntotally ignorant of the real nature of the creatures they name.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to be a naturalist in the true sense of the term, study your\r\n_specimens_, and take but little pains to commit their hard names to\r\nmemory; and you will then find that the latter will gradually become\r\nyour own property without any special effort on your part. Your\r\ncontinued reference to illustrated works and museum collections will\r\nbring them to you almost unconsciously, and you will generally find your\r\nentomological vocabulary extending as rapidly as your cabinet becomes\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nAgain, with regard to the _meanings_ of the scientific terms, don't\r\ntrouble much about them. It unfortunately happens that in a very large\r\nnumber of cases these names are ill chosen, and do not in any way refer\r\nto the distinguishing characteristics of the species to which they are\r\napplied. You will observe, too, if you look at the table, that many\r\ninsects have _two_ scientific names applied to the species, one being\r\nplaced in brackets after the other. In such cases both these names are\r\nin common use, having both been applied by independent authorities, and\r\nthe insertion of the two will prove an assistance at times.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice with entomologists, in their communications, to\r\nuse only the second or _specific_ name of insects. Thus, they would\r\nspeak of the Brimstone Butterfly as _Rhamni_, and not _Gonopteryx\r\nRhamni_. When _writing_ a communication, however, they very commonly\r\nplace in front of the specific name the initial letter of the first or\r\n_generic_ name. Thus the full title of the butterfly just mentioned\r\nwould be abbreviated to _G. Rhamni_.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much concerning the principles of classification and\r\nnomenclature, we will pass on to the practical portion of the\r\nentomologist's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nWORK AT HOME AND IN THE FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_CATCHING BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not at all surprising that entomology should prove such a\r\nfascinating study to the young, and more especially that portion which\r\ndeals with the department we are now considering. Butterflies and moths\r\nare among the most beautiful and most interesting of living creatures.\r\nThe study of their life history is enchanting, and the creatures\r\nthemselves are of such a size as to be conveniently handled and\r\npreserved, and withal occupy so little space that anyone with only\r\nmoderate accommodation may possess a fairly typical collection.\r\n\r\nCompare the work of the entomologist with that of one whose hobby is the\r\nstudy of mammals. The latter has to deal with large and cumbersome\r\nobjects, a collection of which requires an enormous amount of space;\r\nand, unless he has the time and means to travel in foreign countries, he\r\ncannot get together a good typical collection of specimens representing\r\nhis particular branch, for the few British mammals contain no\r\nrepresentatives of several of the orders into which the class is\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nEntomology is undoubtedly, _par excellence_, _the_ study for youngsters.\r\nIt is equally suited to the studious and to those of an adventurous turn\r\nof mind. It leads its follower into the bright sunshine and the flowery\r\nmeadows; and with body and mind pleasantly occupied, the joy of living\r\nis deeply felt. The necessary apparatus can be made by anyone. No\r\ndangerous gun is required, and there are no precipitous rocks to scale.\r\nWhen the autumn flowers fade the year's work of the entomologist is not\r\ndone, for the arranging of his cabinet and the demands of his living\r\nspecimens keep him more or less actively engaged until the flowers of\r\nthe following spring call both him and the insects he loves once more\r\ninto the field. And so, season after season, and year after year, he\r\nfinds himself engrossed in labours so fascinating that idleness--the\r\ncurse of so many of our youths--is with him an impossibility.\r\n\r\nI assume that the readers of this book have a desire to take up the\r\nstudy of one branch of entomology--that of butterflies and moths--in\r\nreal earnest; that they intend not only to _read_ about these\r\ninteresting insects, but to _know_ them. And there is only one way in\r\nwhich one may really get to know living creatures; that is by searching\r\nthem out in their haunts, observing their growth and habits, and by an\r\noccasional close examination in order to become acquainted with their\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nHence I shall in this, the practical portion of the work, give such\r\ninformation as will assist the beginner in catching, preserving,\r\nrearing, breeding, and arranging the specimens that are to form his\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catching Butterflies_\r\n\r\nThere was a time when we would try to capture a butterfly at rest on a\r\nflower by a quick sweep of the hand, or, more commonly, by a sharp\r\ndownward stroke of the cap. We were led to this action by a mere\r\nchildish love of sport, or by a desire to possess an insect simply\r\nbecause it was pretty. When we succeeded in securing our prize, we\r\nhandled it somewhat carelessly, often passing it from one hand to the\r\nother, or boxing it in our closed and perspiring fist till our fingers\r\nwere dusted with the pretty microscopic scales of the creature's wings,\r\nand the wings themselves, stripped of all their beautiful clothing, were\r\nmerely transparent and veined membranes. Having thus carelessly but\r\nunintentionally deprived the creature of its greatest beauty, we set it\r\nfree, often in such a damaged or exhausted condition that the poor thing\r\ncould scarcely fly.\r\n\r\nBut our childish ideas and inclinations have vanished. Now we would\r\nrather watch the insect than catch it, for we find much pleasure and\r\ninterest in its varied movements. And if for purposes of study we\r\noccasionally require to make one captive, we proceed in such a manner as\r\nto preserve its beauty unimpaired. The cap now gives place to a\r\nwell-made and suitable net; and we are careful to provide ourselves with\r\nsufficient and proper accommodation for our captives.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many of my readers are as yet unacquainted with the\r\nnature of an entomologist's requirements for field work, so we shall\r\ndescribe them, confining ourselves at first to those that are required\r\nfor a butterfly hunt.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost comes the net. This essential portion of your\r\nequipment may be either purchased or constructed by yourself. Very\r\nlittle skill is required to enable you to do the former. Provided your\r\npocket is well charged, you may start off at once to the dealer in\r\nnaturalists' appliances, and treat yourself to a complete outfit. But\r\neven in this case a little advice may not be out of place. See that what\r\nyou purchase is very _strongly_ made. You can get nicely finished nets\r\nconstructed on the most convenient principles, made to fold and go in an\r\nordinary coat pocket, but with _weak joints_. See that you have the most\r\nconvenient form of net by all means, but do not go in for convenience\r\nand appearance at the expense of strength and durability. Nothing is\r\nmore annoying than to find your net give way just when you are in the\r\nmidst of a good day's sport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--A WIRE FRAME FOR A BUTTERFLY NET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe folding net is certainly very convenient, for you can conceal it in\r\nyour pocket while you are walking through town or travelling in a\r\nrailway carriage, and thus avoid that contemptuous gaze which certain of\r\nthe public are prone to cast on a poor 'bug hunter.' And although such\r\nnets are generally purchased, yet they _may_ be constructed by anyone\r\nwho has had experience in the working of metals. But other forms of\r\nnets, equally useful and even stronger, can be made by anybody; and I\r\nwill give a few hints on two or three different ways of putting them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nA very simple and strong frame for a net may be made as follows: Get a\r\npiece of stout iron or brass wire about forty inches in length, and bend\r\nit into a circle with the two ends, turned out about two inches each, at\r\nright angles to the circumference as shown in the accompanying sketch.\r\n\r\nNow take a good tough stick, the length of an ordinary walking stick,\r\nand cut out two grooves opposite each other at the end, just large\r\nenough to take the straight ends of the wire. The end of the stick will\r\nnow resemble fig. 40 in shape. Place the ends in their grooves, and bind\r\nthem tightly to the stick by a good many turns of rather fine wire.\r\n\r\nA frame well made after this fashion is as strong as anything you could\r\ndesire, but it has the disadvantage of being always fixed to the handle,\r\nthus preventing the use of the latter as a walking stick when you are\r\nnot directly engaged in your entomological work.\r\n\r\nA much more convenient frame may be made by thrusting the ends of a\r\npiece of cane into the two narrow arms of a metal Y. You may purchase\r\nthe Y at any of the naturalists' stores, or you can make one yourself if\r\nyou know how to perform the operation of soldering. I have always made\r\nmine with odds and ends of brass tubing such as old gas pipes. One piece\r\nmust be just the size to fix on the stick; and the other two must fit\r\nthe cane tightly. The three pieces must be filed off at the proper\r\nangles, and the doubly bevelled end of the wider tube must then be\r\nflattened down to the width of the smaller ones before soldering. If you\r\ndecide to buy one, give the preference to strong brass rather than the\r\ncheaper and more fragile ones made of tinned iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. THE METAL Y.]\r\n\r\nThe advantage of such an arrangement over the last frame is evident at\r\nonce. The cane, with net attached, can be pulled out of the Y when not\r\nin use, and bent small enough to go in the pocket or a satchel; and the\r\nY can also be separated from the stick, thus allowing the latter to be\r\nused as a walking stick.\r\n\r\nSome entomologists speak very favourably of what is known as the\r\n'umbrella net'--a large and light net that will shut up like an\r\numbrella, and may even be made to look very much like this useful\r\nprotector, but the possession of such an imitation is somewhat\r\ntantalising in a pelting shower. The ring of this net consists of two\r\nsteel springs attached to a couple of brass hinges, one of which is\r\nfixed near one end of the handle, while the other slides up and down in\r\nthe gamp fashion.\r\n\r\nOne other form of net--'the clap net'--although still occasionally seen,\r\nhas had its best days. Two sticks are provided to this one, so that the\r\ntwo sides of the net may be brought together on the insect; but as both\r\nhands are required to manage it, it is almost surprising that it ever\r\nhad any advocates at all.\r\n\r\nWhen your frame is completed, sew round it a strip of strong calico, to\r\nwhich the net itself may be afterwards sewn, for the lighter material of\r\nthe net is too delicate to stand the constant friction against the metal\r\nor cane frame.\r\n\r\nThe material usually employed in making the 'bag' is called leno. It can\r\nbe purchased at most of the drapers' shops, and three colours--white,\r\nyellow and green--are usually kept in stock. Measure the circumference\r\nof your net frame, and see that you get sufficient leno to make a good\r\nfull net. Suppose, for instance, that the circle of your frame measures\r\nthirty-six inches round, then your leno should be at least forty inches\r\nin length. Fold this double, and then cut out two pieces of the shape\r\nshown in fig. 42, letting the depth of the net be nearly or quite equal\r\nto the width of the material. There is nothing to be done now but to\r\nstitch the bag together and sew it to the calico on the ring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\nAt first you will find the leno rather stiff and harsh, but a damping\r\nand good rubbing between the hands will soften it down; or, if you\r\nprefer it, you may soften the material by a slight washing before\r\ncutting out the net. The latter is perhaps the better plan, for the\r\nwashing will remove the objectionable 'dressing' that renders the\r\nmaterial rather hard and stiff.\r\n\r\nOf the three colours mentioned above, green is the one most generally\r\nchosen, because it is more in harmony with the surroundings of a\r\nbutterfly catcher; but many prefer the white leno to the green, as the\r\ninsects are more easily seen in a net of this colour. Yellow is\r\ncertainly not a desirable tint.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it will be necessary to kill an insect as soon as it is\r\ncaptured. This is always the case with butterflies unless you require to\r\nkeep them alive either to watch their movements or to obtain eggs. For\r\nthis purpose you will require a killing bottle or box containing some\r\nvolatile substance.\r\n\r\nThe selection of this necessary piece of apparatus is a point deserving\r\nof much consideration, for so many different forms are in use by\r\ndifferent entomologists, and so many advocates each declare that his own\r\nplan is far superior to that of any of the others, that the final\r\ndecision is not to be worked out in a moment. The best thing for a\r\nbeginner is to try as many as he can, and then, after some considerable\r\nexperience of his own, he will be able to decide which apparatus suits\r\nhimself best.\r\n\r\nI recommend this because it is impossible to say of any one plan that it\r\nis the best, for that which gives perfect satisfaction to one individual\r\nwill often fail to give anything but annoyance in the hands of another.\r\n\r\nTo enable my young readers to follow the advice I have just given, I\r\nwill describe some of the commonly used killing arrangements and show\r\nhow they should be used.\r\n\r\nI will take first the 'cyanide bottle.' This is a wide-mouthed bottle,\r\ncontaining a very poisonous substance called _cyanide of potassium_. It\r\nis fitted with a good sound cork. The 'cyanide' is a solid substance,\r\nand must be fixed in some way or other at the bottom of the bottle so\r\nthat it cannot shake about and damage the butterflies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE CYANIDE BOTTLE.]\r\n\r\nA cyanide bottle can be purchased ready for use at the cost of a\r\nshilling or thereabouts; but if you are old enough to be trusted with\r\ndeadly poisons, you may buy the 'cyanide' of a chemist who knows you\r\nwell and is satisfied as to your intentions, and then prepare your own.\r\nEvery entomologist should know how to do this, for the poison loses its\r\npower after some time, and it is not always convenient to leave your\r\nbottle in the hands of a chemist or a 'naturalist' to have it recharged.\r\nThis will cost you more than it would to do it yourself, but that is\r\nnothing compared with the annoyance that may result when, the night\r\nbefore an anticipated butterfly hunt, you are calmly told that 'your\r\nbottle will be ready in a few days.' You can charge it yourself in a few\r\nminutes if you can manage to keep a small supply of 'cyanide' in stock,\r\nand it is ready for use very shortly after.\r\n\r\nHere is the _modus operandi_.--Purchase an ounce or two of the cyanide\r\nof potassium, and immediately put it into a stoppered or well-corked\r\nbottle. Label it at once, not only with the name, but also with the word\r\nPOISON in very large and conspicuous letters. This dangerous chemical is\r\noften sold in sticks that look much like certain 'sugar sticks' I was\r\nacquainted with in my younger days; but whether this is or is not the\r\ncase with your cyanide, see that the bottle is kept quite out of the\r\nreach of the inquisitive and sugar-loving juveniles of the house.\r\n\r\nThe quantity above mentioned is more than you will require for the first\r\n'charge,' but you will soon experience the convenience of having a\r\nsupply always at hand for recharging when your cyanide bottle fails to\r\ndo its work expeditiously, or when an accident calls for the somewhat\r\nsudden appearance of a new one.\r\n\r\nNow procure a bottle for your work. Its mouth must be wide enough to\r\ntake the largest insect you hope to catch, and the widest part of the\r\nbottle need not be much larger. Get a perfectly sound cork to fit it\r\ntightly; and, to insure the more perfect exclusion of air, paint over\r\nthe top of the cork with melted paraffin wax.\r\n\r\nDissolve a few drams of the cyanide in a little water, using a glass rod\r\nto stir up the mixture till the solid has all disappeared; and be\r\ncareful that neither the solid nor the solution touches the skin if it\r\nshould be in the slightest degree scratched or broken. Now sprinkle\r\nplaster of Paris into the solution, a little at a time, and stir all the\r\nwhile. As soon as the mixture begins to set, pour it into your bottle as\r\ncleanly as you can--that is, without touching the sides--and press it\r\ndown with the flat end of a stick if it is not level. Now cork it, and\r\nput the bottle away in a cool place till required for use.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, the best way of charging the bottle; but there are two\r\nother common methods that may, perhaps, be regarded as a little more\r\nsimple. One is this: put a few small lumps of the 'cyanide' into your\r\nbottle, and then cover them with a stiff mixture of plaster of Paris and\r\nwater, and press down as before. The other plan is to cover the\r\n'cyanide' with a few thicknesses of blotting paper, cut just a little\r\nlarger than the inside of the bottle. The first of these two methods is\r\nfairly satisfactory, but I have always found that the charge, when made\r\nin this way, has a tendency to become wet and pasty, in which condition\r\nit will spoil the wings of the insects. The other is very objectionable,\r\nespecially for field work, for the blotting paper fails to keep its\r\nplace while you are on the chase. If the plaster is used, the mixing\r\nmust be done quickly and without hesitation, or the mixture will become\r\nsolid before you can press it into your bottle.\r\n\r\nWe will not enter now into the _pros_ and _cons_ of the cyanide bottle,\r\nbut will consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various\r\nmethods of killing the insects after we have noticed a few more.\r\n\r\nThe 'laurel box' has had many devoted advocates, although it does not\r\nseem to be much in use now. It is a very good arrangement, however, but\r\nis a little more troublesome than the cyanide bottle, as it requires\r\nfrequent replenishing.\r\n\r\nA very good laurel box may be prepared as follows. Get a small tin box\r\nof cylindrical form, measuring about five inches by two, and cut a\r\ncircle of perforated zinc or wood just the size to fit it snugly as a\r\nfalse bottom without any danger of falling out of its place. Now gather\r\nsome of the young leaves of the green laurel bush, and beat them almost\r\nto a pulp with a mallet or hammer. Place this in your tin box, and press\r\ndown the perforated false bottom on it. The bruised laurel leaves give\r\noff a very powerful odour, which stupefies butterflies immediately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--SECTION OF THE LAUREL BOX.\r\n\r\n_a_, space for insects; _b_, perforated partition; _c_, bruised laurel\r\nleaves.]\r\n\r\nOf course the reader may be able to think of various other ways in which\r\nthe laurel box may be made. Any arrangement will do providing the vapour\r\ncan come to the insects without allowing the leaves to touch their\r\nwings; and any ingenious youth could manufacture a more satisfactory\r\narticle than the one I have mentioned. My desire is, as far as possible,\r\nto give instructions that may easily be carried out by anyone, even if\r\nhe has not the slightest mechanical skill, leaving the clever youth,\r\nsometimes, the opportunity of displaying his own inventive power. But in\r\nthis case I will give a few suggestions concerning other ways in which a\r\nlaurel killer may be constructed. A firm and _fixed_ false bottom is a\r\ndecided advantage. This is easily managed by fixing a circular piece of\r\nperforated zinc or 'tin' by means of a little solder; or even a wood\r\npartition may be used, fixed with a few brads, driven into it from the\r\noutside. With the fixed partition, however, you must have a lid at each\r\nend of the box. This is easily managed if you get two tins of the same\r\nsize, knock out the bottom of one, and fit the lid of the other in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nI have heard of laurel boxes without any partition save a piece of rag\r\nin which the bruised leaves are wrapped. The whole is _pressed_ into the\r\nbox so firmly that it is not likely to be displaced while you are on the\r\nchase. I do not recommend this, for in addition to the chance of its\r\nslipping there is a danger of the sap of the leaves exuding through the\r\nrag and spoiling the insects' wings. But if the reader should prefer to\r\ntry this on account of its simplicity, it will probably occur to him\r\nthat a bottle may be used instead of a tin box.\r\n\r\nA well-made laurel box, with a fixed metal partition, is a piece of\r\napparatus strongly to be recommended to all young entomologists who\r\ndesire to test the relative value of the various poisons that are used\r\nby the different experts; for with it any one of these substances can be\r\nused. In the poison compartment you can place pieces of 'cyanide'\r\nwrapped in blotting paper, or any kind of porous substance moistened\r\nwith liquid ammonia, chloroform, benzole, or any other volatile liquid\r\ninsecticide. All the above-named substances are declared to be 'the\r\nbest,' so they must all be worth the trial.\r\n\r\n'Cyanide' is valued on account of its lasting powers. A cyanide bottle\r\nwell charged will retain its efficiency throughout a whole season. I\r\nalways recharge two in the spring, one for active service in the field\r\nand the other as a reserve force; and these kept in a cool place do good\r\nexecution throughout the year. If they should exhibit a slight failing,\r\na few minutes' warming before a fire will improve them; but for field\r\nwork it is better to recharge. At the same time see that the corks are\r\nin good condition.\r\n\r\nNext to the 'cyanide,' the bruised laurel takes the first rank for\r\npermanency; but you must not expect this to last many days. For a few\r\ndays' continuous work one charge will suffice, but if the laurel box has\r\nnot been in use for some time you must have a fresh supply.\r\n\r\nThe liquid poisons, such as ammonia, chloroform, and benzole, are so\r\nvolatile that they are very powerful for a short time, but so much\r\nvapour is lost each time the box is opened that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to carry a bottle of the one you use into the field with you.\r\nAlso see that you have sufficient of the blotting paper or other\r\nabsorbent to prevent the liquid from leaking through the perforations of\r\nthe partition.\r\n\r\nIf you choose ammonia--a substance that is not regarded as a poison, and\r\nis therefore easily obtained from any chemist--always get the strongest,\r\nand see that it is labelled 'Liq. Ammonia, S.G. .880' as a guarantee. A\r\nsmall bottle such as you can conveniently carry in the waistcoat pocket\r\nwill contain sufficient for a day's work. Use only a few drops at a\r\ntime, but renew frequently. Although the ammonia corrodes cork, yet a\r\ngood cork is far preferable for the pocket to a glass stopper, for its\r\nelasticity prevents it from losing its hold, and the liquid from\r\nsaturating your pocket and its surroundings; but a glass stopper is\r\ncertainly better for the stock solution kept at home.\r\n\r\nMost of the above remarks apply equally well to benzole and to\r\nchloroform, but the latter is so powerful a poison that a very little is\r\nrequired for a day's work, and consequently a very small bottle is more\r\nconvenient. The dealers in naturalist's appliances supply metal\r\n'chloroform bottles' with screw stoppers and a small nozzle that will\r\nallow the liquid to run out only in drops. This is a very good\r\narrangement, since it enables you to avoid the 'drop too much' which is\r\nnot only unnecessary and therefore wasteful, but saves you from\r\nexperiencing the disappointment of an empty bottle before your work is\r\nhalf done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--THE CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.]\r\n\r\nSome entomologists recommend the solid carbonate of ammonium instead of\r\nliquid ammonia, but this is not so powerful. It must be remembered that\r\nwe have the butterflies to consider, as well as our own convenience, in\r\nthe selection of the poisons we use. It is the opinion of many\r\nwell-known entomologists that 'insects cannot feel pain,' and that we\r\nare therefore at liberty to deal with them in any way we please. Still\r\nit is as well to save all possible suffering, and be satisfied with no\r\nkilling box that is not practically instantaneous in its effects.\r\n\r\nAmong other poisons used by entomologists I may mention sulphur fumes\r\nand tobacco smoke. The former may be obtained by burning a little\r\nsulphur or a sulphured lucifer match under the perforations of a killing\r\nbox of the pattern described, and the latter--well, every smoker knows\r\nthat. I should at once condemn the former method, at least for field\r\nwork, as troublesome and inconvenient; and as to the other, I have tried\r\nthe effect of a puff (and many puffs) of tobacco smoke on an imprisoned\r\ninsect, but was so dissatisfied with the result that I am not likely to\r\ndo so again.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered a good many insecticides more or less suitable to\r\nour purpose, but there still remains the unsolved problem as to which is\r\nthe best. Each one has its advantages. For _convenience_ nothing beats\r\nthe cyanide bottle. It is very speedy in its action, and the use of a\r\nbottle is a little preferable to a metal box, for you can always satisfy\r\nyourself as to its efficiency without opening it. Cyanide, chloroform,\r\nbenzole, and some others render the insects more or less brittle and\r\nstiff, so that it is not so easy to 'set' them for the cabinet. Perhaps,\r\nif you happen to have a supply of growing laurel close at hand, you\r\ncannot do better than stick to the laurel box. The time taken in\r\nbruising up a few leaves is inconsiderable, and the moisture given off\r\nfrom them will keep your insects moist and supple, or will even 'relax'\r\nthem if they have become rigid. But try various plans for yourself, and\r\nyou will be able to settle a question which all the entomologists in the\r\nworld cannot answer for you--which method answers best in _your_ hands.\r\n\r\nThe next item for our consideration is the 'collecting box.' This is\r\nmerely a box in which the butterflies are pinned as soon as they are\r\ndead. Here, again, we shall note a few variations from which a selection\r\ncan be made according to the means or the ingenuity of the reader. For a\r\ncouple of shillings you can obtain a good zinc collecting box, lined\r\nwith cork, of oval form (a most convenient shape for the pocket), and\r\nquite large enough for one day's captures; and half that modest sum will\r\npurchase a wooden box, also lined with cork, adapted to the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAs with many other things, so with collecting boxes, the cheapest is\r\noften the dearest in the end. You may feel inclined to save a shilling\r\nby buying a wooden box, but you are sure to discard it after a little\r\npractical experience for a metal one. We shall speak a little later on\r\nconcerning the advisability of 'setting' the butterflies as soon as\r\npossible after capture; but this is not always practicable, especially\r\nafter a good day's catch. Now, if the insects are pinned in a wooden\r\nbox, they soon become dry and rigid, and consequently cannot be 'set'\r\ntill they have been put through the more or less tedious process of\r\n'relaxing.' If you use a wooden collecting box you will often find, on a\r\nhot and dry day, that all or nearly all your butterflies are rigid\r\nbefore you arrive home; but a metal box will keep them moist and supple,\r\nso that you can even put off the setting till the following day if you\r\nare unable to do it immediately after your return.\r\n\r\nAnother point worth considering is the best economy of space. If your\r\ncollecting box is only about one inch deep inside, you have room for\r\nonly one layer of pinned insects; but a box only a little deeper may be\r\nlined with cork both at top and bottom, and thus be made to accommodate\r\ndouble the number. The zinc boxes sold by the dealers are generally\r\nlined with cork in this manner, and are, of course, deep enough for the\r\ndouble layer of specimens; but the wooden boxes are sometimes lined on\r\nthe bottom only. After these few remarks you will at once see the\r\neconomy of expending the extra shilling on the former.\r\n\r\nAlthough the prices of collecting boxes are low, yet there are many who\r\nwould prefer making their own, and there is much to be said in favour of\r\nthis. A great deal of pleasure is to be derived from the construction of\r\nyour own apparatus, especially when that apparatus is afterwards to be\r\nused in the pursuit of a delightful hobby. During the whole of the time\r\nthus engaged, you are looking forward with the most pleasurable feelings\r\nto the glorious treat before you, and every joint you make seems to\r\nbring you nearer to the realisation of your joys. During the bleak\r\nwinter months there is no better employment for an entomologist who has\r\na little spare time than the preparation for the next outing. It is just\r\none of those artful schemes by which he seeks to get as much pleasure\r\nout of life as it is capable of affording. How many there are who, for\r\nthe lack of a pleasant and instructive hobby, find their leisure hours\r\nthe most dismal of all, and who complain of the toil and wearisomeness\r\nof their lot! The mournful thought with them is, 'Is life worth living?'\r\nbut who ever heard such an expression from the lips of an active\r\nentomologist?\r\n\r\nBut I must have done with moralising and proceed to business. The\r\nquestion is--How shall we set to work about the construction of a\r\ncollecting box? If it is to be a wooden one, select or make a box of\r\nsuch a size as to suit your pocket or satchel, and cover the bottom, and\r\nlid too if the depth allows of it, with sheet cork or slices of good\r\nwine corks, about one-eighth of an inch thick, fixed on with glue.\r\n\r\nThe metal box is not quite so easy, but even here you may save yourself\r\nmuch work by keeping your eyes open. Very neat little collecting boxes\r\ncan be made out of the flat metal boxes in which are sold certain\r\nfavourite brands of tobacco. Some of these are just the right depth, and\r\nalso of a very convenient size for the coat pocket. Beg one of these\r\nboxes from a smoking friend, and if the lid is not held by a hinge (a\r\ngreat advantage, by the way), you can easily solder on a brass one.\r\n\r\nAll that remains now is the fixing of the cork. Buy a sheet of cork at a\r\nnaturalist's shop, this being a commodity always in stock, and cut out\r\ntwo pieces just the size to cover the bottom and the lid.\r\n\r\nGum and glue are not very satisfactory as fixing agents, for, as you\r\nwill presently learn, there are times when it will be necessary to keep\r\nthe box moist, and moisture softens both these substances. The cork must\r\nbe fixed by means of little strips of metal. Here are two ways of doing\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nFirst.--Cut a few little strips of sheet tin, each about two inches long\r\nand one-eighth wide. Double and bend them as shown in fig. 46, and\r\nsolder them to the surfaces which the cork is to cover (fig. 47). As the\r\ncork is pushed in its place, these little slips are allowed to force\r\nthemselves through slits in it made by means of a penknife, and then the\r\nends are bent over as shown in fig. 48. Two or three such fasteners will\r\nbe quite sufficient to hold down each sheet of cork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\nSecond.--Put the sheets of cork in their places _first_, then make a few\r\nlittle slits through both metal and cork with the point of a penknife,\r\nand then bind the two together with a few ordinary paper fasteners. This\r\narrangement is shown in section in fig. 49.\r\n\r\nJust one point more concerning the metal collecting box. You will often\r\ncall moisture to your aid in keeping the butterflies flexible and soft.\r\nThis will have but little action on zinc, but will sooner or later cause\r\nthe 'tin' (really tinned iron) box to rust. Here, then, is a point in\r\nfavour of zinc, but still a home-made 'tin' collector will last a long\r\ntime if kept dry when not in use.\r\n\r\nAs already hinted, there are times when it is desirable to take home\r\ncertain butterflies alive, either for a study of their movements or for\r\nthe purpose of securing eggs for breeding. To this end you must provide\r\nyourself either with a number of 'chip boxes' with a few small holes\r\npricked in the cover, or with some metal boxes with perforations for the\r\nadmission of air. If the latter, you will have no difficulty in\r\nsecuring a few 'tin' boxes of suitable size, but, as the surface of the\r\nmetal is very smooth, you should always introduce a few leaves or\r\nsomething else that will provide a foothold for the inmates.\r\n\r\nThe last item of the outfit is the pins. Ordinary draper's pins are\r\nquite out of the question. They are far too thick and clumsy for the\r\ncollector's work. If you are not already acquainted with the\r\n'entomological pins,' you had better ask a dealer to give you a sample\r\ncard. This will be very useful for reference until you become well\r\nacquainted with the various lengths, thicknesses, numbers and prices.\r\nThe card will contain one of each kind, with price and number attached.\r\n\r\nIf you fix a butterfly with the ordinary pin, you may find the latter\r\npartly covered over with verdigris after a time. This bright green\r\nsubstance is formed by the action of decomposing animal matter on the\r\ncopper of the pin, and gives a very unsightly appearance to the\r\nspecimen. To avoid this the entomological pins are either silvered,\r\nblackened or gilded. The silvered pins tarnish after a time, but the two\r\nother kinds keep their colour well, and are therefore better. The gilded\r\nones are rather expensive and unnecessary, and perhaps the black ones\r\nare to be preferred to the silvered, although they are rather more\r\ncostly.\r\n\r\nMost dealers will supply you with a box of mixed pins, each box\r\ncontaining about six different sizes. This is very convenient for those\r\nwho work in a rather small way; but if you intend to make entomology a\r\nprolonged study you had better get an ounce or so of each of the more\r\nuseful sizes.\r\n\r\nButterflies vary much in size, and Nos. 3 to 8 are the most useful sizes\r\nof pins to fix them; No. 3 being for the largest, and 8 for the\r\nsmallest.\r\n\r\nSupposing all the foregoing requisites to be quite ready, still you are\r\nreally by no means prepared for all your work. The butterflies captured\r\nshould be set as soon as possible after your return, and everything\r\nrequired for _this_ part of the work must be in perfect trim. Yet I\r\nthink it will be more convenient just now to confine our attention to\r\nthe subject of 'Catching Butterflies,' leaving all the indoor work to\r\nform the substance of another chapter. Our next point, then, shall be\r\nthe consideration of seasons, times, and localities.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the butterflies make their appearance on the wing in\r\nApril, or, if the weather is mild, towards the end of March; and from\r\nthis time you can find employment up to the end of September or the\r\nbeginning of October--a period of about seven months. But it must not be\r\nsupposed that all parts of this long season are equally prolific, and\r\nwill yield equally valuable catches. Remember the short term of a\r\nbutterfly's life, and bear in mind that each one has its own regular\r\nseason in which to spend the winged state; you will then see that anyone\r\nwho wishes to 'work' as many species as possible must arrange his\r\noutings in accordance with the insects' own times.\r\n\r\nSome butterflies are double-brooded, and the two broods may not come\r\nforth at certain fixed times. Hence they seem to be on the wing almost\r\nwithout cessation for several months together, and therefore need not\r\nhave a special day set apart for them. But others are more uniform in\r\ntheir date of appearance, and die off at about the same time. To catch\r\nsuch as these you must be careful to watch the weather, make allowance\r\nfor any severities that may tend to cause a delay, or an unusually high\r\ntemperature that may hasten their emergence, and then select a day in\r\nwhich you may expect to find them fresh and unworn. A week too early,\r\nand none are to be seen; a week too late, and nearly all you catch are\r\nworn and worthless.\r\n\r\nA glance at our Calendar (Appendix II) will give you a few illustrations\r\nin point. Thus you will observe that May is a month for the 'Whites,'\r\nearly 'Blues' and certain of the Fritillaries; July for most of the\r\nHairstreaks and Browns, and so on. Before you have been long collecting\r\nyou will have captured the very common species, and then you will find\r\nthat your butterfly hunts are very unproductive unless you make it a\r\npoint to try for certain species at the proper times.\r\n\r\nTime, however, is not the only thing to take into account when preparing\r\nfor a day with the butterflies. It is equally important that we should\r\ncarefully select our locality in accordance with the known haunts of the\r\nvarious species. As long as you are simply working up the common kinds,\r\nyou may wander almost at random in waste places, flowery meadows, corn\r\nfields, railway banks, &c.; but when you have secured a few specimens of\r\neach of these, you must search out the favoured resorts of the more\r\nlocal and the rarer species. For instance, wooded spots must be visited\r\nif you are to take certain of the Fritillaries, oak woods for the Purple\r\nEmperor and the Purple Hairstreak, fenny districts for the beautiful\r\nSwallow-tail, and so forth. In some cases the butterflies are closely\r\nrestricted to certain isolated localities, to which you must travel if\r\ndetermined to obtain them.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains another important matter to consider, and that is the\r\nkind of day you shall select for your outing. Butterflies are not only\r\nstrictly day-fliers, but most of them venture out only on bright days.\r\nAlways choose as hot a day as possible, with a very bright sun. If you\r\nare to be out for a full day's collecting, manage to be on the hunting\r\nground at about ten o'clock in the morning. As a rule there are not many\r\nout before this time, and some do not appear to stir till an hour later:\r\nstill there are a few 'early birds' among them, one of which--the Wall\r\nButterfly--I have seen on the wing before eight.\r\n\r\nIf your season, your day, and your locality are all well chosen, you may\r\nreckon on a good six hours' work. At about four the butterflies begin to\r\nlag, and then drop into their hiding places, one by one, till only a few\r\nof the late stragglers remain on the wing.\r\n\r\nSo far I have furnished some general instructions that may be regarded\r\nas preparatory to the start; but I will now give a few hints as to the\r\nmode of procedure when the day for field work has come.\r\n\r\nFirst, see that you have secured _all_ your apparatus, and that it is in\r\nperfect condition. What is more annoying than to find, after you have\r\ntravelled some miles to get to your hunting ground, that you have left\r\nyour screw ferrule at home, or that the soldering of your metal Y is\r\njust giving way? If you are troubled with a short memory, it will be\r\nadvisable to make out a list of every requisite for your field work, and\r\nkeep this for reference on all field days.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of your equipment for a day with the butterflies. Net,\r\nferrule or Y, stick, collecting box (the cork of which should be damped\r\nif the box is a metal one), a few 'chip boxes' for live insects, killing\r\napparatus, a good supply of pins of several sizes, a piece of string,\r\nneedle and cotton, and your penknife.\r\n\r\nYou observe in this list one or two items not previously mentioned,\r\nsince they hardly come under the category of apparatus, but a moment's\r\nthought will convince you of their usefulness, especially in the case of\r\na breakdown. If your net catches in a thorn--a very common\r\noccurrence--and a big rent is made, the needle and cotton will save you\r\na deal of agony, and perhaps loss of temper. If your stick breaks under\r\nyour exertions, the knife or the string may prove a most valuable\r\ncompanion. Your pins may be stuck in the cork of your collecting box,\r\ncertainly the most convenient spot for immediate use; but you may also\r\nhave a reserve store in a small pocket cushion, or arranged neatly on a\r\nstrip of flannel which can be rolled up in the waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nAt last you are on the hunting ground, fully equipped but inexperienced,\r\nand at first find yourself just a little awkward in the use of your new\r\ngear. Your experience with the cap has been a very wide one, and you are\r\npossibly an expert at knocking down 'Whites' in the streets and in your\r\nneighbour's kitchen gardens. Now you have to wield the net, and coax\r\nyour captives into your killing bottle; hence a slight feeling of\r\nincompetence at first.\r\n\r\nYou soon get over this, however, and within five minutes you may be seen\r\nfuriously slashing away at all the poor butterflies that come within\r\nrange, common 'Whites' and dingy 'Browns' receiving as much attention at\r\nyour hands as any rare gem that may happen to cross your path.\r\n\r\nHow different are the movements of an experienced collector! He walks\r\nstealthily along the route he has chosen, apparently taking but little\r\nnotice of the majority of butterflies that approach and pass him. He has\r\nalready secured his 'series' of nearly all the species, and is carefully\r\non the watch for the gems that are required to complete his cabinet. His\r\nactions are slow and deliberate rather than rash; and he trusts more to\r\nhis eyes than his legs.\r\n\r\nThe beginner may take to his field work quite to his own satisfaction,\r\nand may travel homeward with a feeling of great pride over his first\r\nday's catch; but yet there are a few points in which a little advice may\r\nnot be quite out of place, particularly so with regard to the management\r\nof the net, and the killing and pinning of the insects.\r\n\r\nMost of the butterflies may be caught on the wing, and it is far better\r\nto net them in the air than to sweep them off the herbage and flowers.\r\nIf these are rather low, you should strike the net smartly _upwards_\r\nfrom below them, but of course this movement is impossible with insects\r\nthat happen to be almost above your reach. If a butterfly is busily\r\nengaged in searching out its sweet food, flying from flower to flower,\r\ndon't think of giving chase, but follow it up stealthily, and you will\r\nsooner or later get an opportunity of striking at it while in the air.\r\nSometimes, however, you will see a powerful flier making a straight dash\r\nacross your field, taking no notice whatever of the fragrant blossoms,\r\nbut evidently engaged on some important errand. If such happens to be a\r\nspecies you require, then you must run for it, but you will probably be\r\nsatisfied with only a few chases of this kind, particularly if the sun\r\nis very hot, and the ground diversified with clumps of furze, heather,\r\n'molehills,' and ditches.\r\n\r\nThere are times when your only plan of netting a butterfly is to sweep\r\nit from a flower or leaf on which it has settled. If the vegetation is\r\nvery low, you have simply to bring the net down upon it, and then,\r\nholding up the apex of the net with the other hand so as to give it room\r\nto fly, you can inclose it by grasping the lower part of the net as soon\r\nas the butterfly has fluttered upward. If the herbage is tall it is\r\nadvisable to strike either upward or sideways at the insect, starting it\r\nfrom the leaf or flower on which it rests; for if you bring _down_ the\r\nnet you will have to inclose the whole or part of the plant on which the\r\nbutterfly has settled--a procedure that often ends in a torn net, or in\r\nthe insect becoming damaged through being rubbed against the plant.\r\n\r\nWhenever you capture a butterfly by a sweep of the net through the air,\r\nyou immediately turn the ring into a horizontal position, so that the\r\nbag of the net closes itself as it falls over the edge. This gives you\r\nan opportunity of examining the insect before you introduce your killing\r\nbottle. This is a very necessary precaution, for you are generally\r\nunable to judge of the condition of a butterfly while on the wing, and\r\nin some cases you cannot even be certain of the species. If, then, you\r\nwere to call the killing bottle into requisition for every capture you\r\nmake, you would certainly find yourself taking the life of many an\r\ninsect that is of no use whatever to you. Always examine your specimens\r\nat the moment they have been secured, at least as far as it is possible\r\nto do so, by looking through the gauze; and let your examination be as\r\nbrief as possible, or some of the butterflies that were at first in\r\nsplendid condition will render themselves useless to you during their\r\nstruggles to get away.\r\n\r\nWhen satisfied that an insect is likely to be of value to you, keep it\r\nin the apex of the net by grasping the bag beneath it with the left\r\nhand, and then introduce the opened killing bottle with the other hand.\r\nAs a rule you will experience not the slightest difficulty in coaxing it\r\ninto its trap, and then you quickly cover the mouth of the killing\r\nbottle with the gauze, then apply your left hand, using it as a\r\ntemporary stopper for a few seconds, and now, the insect having been\r\nquieted, replace the cork.\r\n\r\nA good killing bottle is almost instantaneous in its action, not only\r\nstupefying, but immediately killing the insects; and as soon as you are\r\nsure that each specimen is quite dead, you may pin it in your collecting\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nYou must be cautious, however, on the one hand, that you do not take it\r\nout too soon. If you do you may find that it recovers from the mere\r\nstupefying effect of the poison, even after it has been pinned, and when\r\nyou open your collecting box for the next butterfly, you are horrified\r\nat the sight of the poor victim struggling to free itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, don't keep the insects in the killing bottle too\r\nlong. If you do you will soon have a number, one lying on another, and\r\nall tumbled about together while you are on the chase. Of course, under\r\nsuch circumstances you are sure to damage them more or less.\r\n\r\nMany collectors, although they may always use a killing bottle for\r\nmoths, never employ one for butterflies, but kill them by pinching the\r\nthorax. It is well to know how to do this, for it sometimes turns out to\r\nbe a really quicker process than that we have just been considering;\r\nand, more than this, you can resort to it should you break or lose your\r\nbottle while in the field. It is done in this manner: Bring the two\r\nopposite sides of the net together, closing them on the insect so that\r\nit cannot flutter. If now the wings are brought together over the back,\r\nall is right, but if not, give it just a little room to flutter till you\r\nhave the opportunity of closing the gauze upon it with the wings in the\r\ndesired position. Now pinch the thorax smartly between the finger and\r\nthe thumb, applying the pressure outside the net, but be careful not to\r\nsqueeze the abdomen. In a moment you will find the insect quite dead,\r\nand not in the least damaged unless you performed the operation\r\nclumsily.\r\n\r\nNow as to pinning. Hold the dead butterfly between the finger and thumb\r\nof the left hand, and pass a pin of convenient size through the centre\r\nof the thorax above, and push it through so that the point appears\r\ncentrally on the under surface. It is now ready for your collecting box.\r\n\r\nSo you work on till the sun begins to get low, and the butterflies\r\nbecome fewer and fewer, till only a few stragglers of common species are\r\nto be seen. Still there are a few hours of daylight and perhaps even of\r\nbright sunshine before you, and if you are not weary with the work done,\r\nyou may very profitably spend these hours in the collection and study of\r\nthe habits of moths.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catching Moths by Day_\r\n\r\nThe reason for choosing the sunny hours for butterfly collecting is\r\nobvious, all these lovers of brightness being then actively on the wing;\r\nand although many may be driven out of their hiding places by beating\r\nthe herbage with the handle of your net, or even be searched out as they\r\nrest on stalks and leaves during dull days or at morning and evening\r\ntwilight, yet such methods are comparatively tedious and unproductive.\r\n\r\nSome moths also are lovers of sunshine, and while engaged in butterfly\r\nhunting you will often meet with a moth flying briskly from flower to\r\nflower and taking its fill of both sweetness and brightness. Again, as\r\nyou wade among flowery herbs in quest of butterflies you will certainly\r\ndisturb a number of moths, causing them to take a short flight in search\r\nof a safer spot. Thus you will almost invariably find a few moths among\r\nthe contents of your collecting box even though you made no special\r\neffort to seek them out. But we shall now see how we may set to work to\r\nobtain a successful catch of moths at times when butterflies are not so\r\nmuch in demand, or during the less brilliant hours of the day, when\r\nbutterflies are at rest.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus required for this work need not differ in any important\r\nrespect from that recommended for butterflies. The same net is used, any\r\nreliable killing bottle will do, and the pins and collecting box used\r\nfor butterflies are equally serviceable. But your mode of procedure is\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\nAs you walk towards your proposed hunting ground you will do well to\r\nexamine the trunks of trees, old walls, and wooden fences. In this way\r\nyou will meet with moths fast asleep, which are consequently easily\r\ntaken. All you have to do is to hold the open killing bottle obliquely\r\njust below the insect, and then push it gently downward with a small\r\ntwig or stalk. As a rule the moth will drop direct into the bottle and\r\nmake no attempt to fly away; but some are very light sleepers, ready to\r\ntake flight at the slightest disturbance; and when dealing with these\r\nyou must be careful to bring the mouth of the killing bottle so closely\r\nround them that there is no room for flight except into the bottle\r\nitself. It is well, however, not to take long at this kind of searching,\r\nbut to reserve as much as possible of your time for what you consider to\r\nbe a very favourable locality.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, a good locality for butterflies is a favourable one\r\nalso for moths, and you will do well to give special attention to\r\nwell-grown hedges, especially those that surround clover fields; also\r\novergrown banks, the borders of woods, open spaces in woods, the trunks\r\nof isolated trees, gravel pits, and old chalk quarries.\r\n\r\nWalk beside or among the undergrowth of woods, or among the tall herbage\r\nof waste places, tapping the branches and twigs with the handle of your\r\nnet as you go. Then, if your locality is well selected, you will rouse\r\nmoths to flight at almost every stroke. Some of these will shoot upward\r\namong the lofty branches and disappear quite beyond your reach; others\r\nwill fly rather low and somewhat heavily, giving you favourable\r\nopportunities to try your skill with the net; others, again, will fly\r\nonly a yard or so, and alight on a neighbouring leaf, often remaining so\r\nquiet that the killing bottle is easily made to inclose them.\r\n\r\nThere are moths that show a decided preference for large trees. These\r\nmay be seen hovering about high branches during the evening twilight,\r\nand sometimes even in sunshine. In many such cases the chance of a\r\ncapture seems hopeless, but occasionally one will descend so low that a\r\nwatchful collector is able to secure it by a sweep of the net.\r\n\r\nIf at any time you are in a locality by day where you suspect the\r\npresence of certain species of moths at rest among the upper branches of\r\ntrees, such branches should be beaten if possible to dislodge the\r\ninsects they may shelter. A long stick will often serve this purpose\r\nwell, and, failing this, a few stones thrown among the branches may\r\nprove effectual. In the case of small and rather slender trees, a kick\r\nagainst the trunk will set the whole in vibration sufficient to surprise\r\nall the lodgers; and the same effect may be produced with larger trees\r\nby giving each a good sound blow with a mallet or some other suitable\r\nimplement.\r\n\r\nThis or any other plan of 'beating' for moths is much more conveniently\r\nworked by two collectors together than by one alone; for one engaged in\r\nbeating the herbage cannot be at the same time fully on the alert with\r\nthe net. If two persons are together, one may take the lead, armed with\r\nthe beating stick only, while the other, only very slightly in the rear,\r\nis always ready to strike.\r\n\r\nWe have said that butterflies should always be killed in the field, but\r\nthis plan is not so universally adopted with moths. Many collectors\r\ncarry a large supply of pill boxes when going out for the latter and\r\nthen take as many as they possibly can by boxing them direct in these.\r\nThis method of 'pill-boxing' is very simple in the case of the lazy and\r\nsoundly sleeping moths. It is only necessary to hold the open box below\r\nthe insect, and then cause it to fall by pressing the lid down gently on\r\nit from above.\r\n\r\nMany of the moths so caught will remain quiet in the boxes and can be\r\ntaken home alive without much fear of damage. All may then be killed at\r\nthe same time by packing all the pill boxes in some vessel of sufficient\r\naccommodation, and shutting them in with a little chloroform, ammonia,\r\nbenzole, or other suitable poison. The vapour will soon find its way\r\nthrough the pores of the pill boxes, but, in order to make its action\r\nspeedy, each one should have a few perforations in the lid.\r\n\r\nWhatever advantages this method may give to the collector who works at\r\nnight, when the process of pinning would be more or less tedious, there\r\nis no necessity for its adoption during the day. The large number of\r\npill boxes required is certainly far more bulky than the single\r\ncollecting box that would accommodate all the day's captures; and\r\nalthough most of the insects boxed alive may be none the worse for the\r\nshaking they get, and may not damage themselves by fluttering in their\r\nsmall prisons, yet there is often a little loss on this score.\r\n\r\nIf you do adopt the pill-boxing method, be very careful that you do not\r\nmix the occupied boxes with the empties; and unless you fix on some\r\ndefinite plan for the prevention of such an occurrence, you will often\r\nfind yourself releasing a prisoner from a box you have just opened to\r\nreceive a new-comer.\r\n\r\nSuppose that you start with all your empties in your right pocket. Then\r\neach one, as soon as it is tenanted, might be placed in the _left_, with\r\nthe name of the insect, or any particular concerning it you would wish\r\nto note, pencilled on the lid.\r\n\r\nWhen examining the trunks of trees you will be continually meeting with\r\nspecimens of very small Moths--_Pyralides_, _Crambi_, _Tortrices_, and\r\n_Tineae_--and at first may find some difficulty in boxing or bottling\r\nsuch small and delicate creatures. A grass stalk will enable you to tip\r\nsome of them into your killing bottle, but some are so snugly packed in\r\ncrevices of the bark that it is almost impossible to get them out\r\nwithout damage, even with a thin and slender stalk. But a sudden puff of\r\nwind from your mouth will often be sufficient to dislodge them and blow\r\nthem into your net, and from this they are easily transferred to a box\r\nor bottle.\r\n\r\nThese few hints will prove sufficient to start you on moth-hunting\r\nexpeditions during the daytime, and will enable you to make good use of\r\nthe dull days and cloudy hours when the butterflies are quiet; but we\r\nmust now turn our attention to the night work of the entomologist, and\r\nsee how we may attract and catch moths during their hours of work and\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Searching for Moths at Night._\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the night-flying moths are attracted by\r\nlights, a characteristic of these insects that it is difficult to\r\nexplain. Their love of darkness is in many instances so decided that\r\nthey absolutely refuse to take flight while the fading light of day\r\nstill lingers on the horizon, and even display a great aversion to the\r\nrays of the moon; and yet these very same species will often rush madly\r\ninto the fierce glare of a naked artificial light, or fly with an energy\r\nalmost amounting to fury against the glass of a street lamp or lighted\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nPuzzling as this peculiar tendency is, we can profitably turn it to our\r\nown account by making it a means of luring a number of moths into our\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way of putting this mode of capture into effect is to post\r\nyourself at your open window, with net and cyanide bottle at hand, while\r\nthe brightest light you can command casts its rays as far and as wide as\r\npossible into darkness outside. If you use an oil lamp for the purpose,\r\nlet it stand just inside the window frame, or, if a jointed gas bracket\r\nhappens to be situated beside the window, bend it round so that the rays\r\nmay pass over a wide area outside.\r\n\r\nTwo such lights are sometimes a very decided advantage--one quite\r\noutside the window to attract the moths from all possible points, and\r\nthen another near the middle of the room to invite them inside. Whether\r\nyou use either one or two lights, always see that it or they are so\r\nsurrounded by a screen that the moths cannot by any possibility rush\r\ninto the flame. There is nothing better for this purpose than a covering\r\nof light gauze, for this is not only a barrier for the prevention of the\r\nsuicidal tendencies of the insects, but it also gives a good foothold to\r\nthose who would like to rest and enjoy the luminous feast.\r\n\r\nYou will soon begin to learn that moths, like ourselves, exhibit great\r\ndifferences in their ways of enjoying their festal moments. Some will\r\nsatisfy themselves by flying _near_ the light in almost a straight\r\ncourse, hardly slackening their speed as they pass; or will, perhaps,\r\nmake a hurried curve round the light and then pass on at once about\r\nother business. To catch these you must be always on the alert, with net\r\nin hand, ready to make a dash at the right moment. But many will make\r\nstraight for the flame, and then, finding a barrier in the form of gauze\r\nor glass, will either flutter round and round as if dissatisfied with\r\nyour attempt to save them from an untimely end, or else settle quietly\r\non the screen to enjoy the brightness for a long period. The flutterers\r\nare usually easily covered by a glass or the open cyanide bottle, and as\r\nfor those that settle down quietly, you can take them at your leisure.\r\n\r\nIt will not do for a collector to depend solely on this method of\r\nobtaining moths, but at times when either his duties or the bad weather\r\nkeeps him at home it affords him a means of capturing a few specimens\r\nthat otherwise would have been missed. He may be even so busily engaged\r\nin other matters that he cannot afford the time to stand and watch with\r\nnet in hand, but the insects that fly into his room and dance round the\r\ngas jet or inquisitively examine the white surface of the ceiling are\r\neasily netted or boxed without much loss of time.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success at this kind of work will vary considerably with\r\nthe aspect, the season, and the weather. If your window opens on a large\r\nflower or fruit garden, on a patch of wooded country with plenty of\r\nunderwood, a piece of waste ground overgrown with rank vegetation, or a\r\nstretch of heath or moor, then you may expect a very large number of\r\nvisitors; but if you are situated on a level and barren country, or in\r\nthe dense atmosphere of a thickly populated district, you must not\r\nreckon on many intruders.\r\n\r\nAs regards the season, this is more extended than that of the\r\nbutterflies. A few species of moths may give you a call during the bleak\r\nnights of October and November, and also during the somewhat less dismal\r\nnights of February and March; but from April to September you may rely\r\non a goodly number of captures. Of course you will not expect many of\r\nthe 'rarities' and 'gems' to find you out; these are to be searched for\r\nin the open field in the manner to be presently described; but your\r\nlights will attract a large number of the commoner species of _Geometrae_\r\nand _Noctuae_, the former _chiefly_ during the early summer, and the\r\nlatter more or less throughout the season.\r\n\r\nA little experience will show you that the atmospheric conditions form a\r\nvery important consideration. The dark and warm nights are the most\r\nproductive. Very little luck is to be anticipated when the full moon is\r\nthrowing down her silvery rays from a clear sky; nor will you see many\r\nwhile a cold east or north-east wind is blowing. Under these conditions\r\nmany moths prefer to keep in the sheltered nooks where they slept away\r\nthe sunny hours of the day. They love a warm and moist air such as calls\r\nforth the odours of the fragrant blossoms that provide their sweets, and\r\nshow no dislike to a fine drizzling rain that you yourself would prefer\r\nto avoid. A pelting shower will generally keep them under cover, but\r\nthey delight in the fresh and moist air that immediately succeeds the\r\npassing storm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--FRAME OF NET FOR COLLECTING INSECTS ON LAMPS\r\nAND WINDOWS.]\r\n\r\nIf you reside on the outskirts of a town an occasional tour of\r\ninspection of street lamps may add a few specimens to your collection,\r\nand some entomologists attach so much importance to the value of these\r\nluminaries that they provide themselves with a special net for the\r\nremoval of moths from the glass and rails (fig. 50). The straight side\r\nmarked _a_ is applied to the panes of glass when flutterers or settlers\r\nare to be taken, and the bend on the opposite side is to secure those\r\nthat rest on the rail. Such a frame is easily made by bending a piece of\r\nstout wire to the required shape, and then soldering it to a ferrule to\r\nreceive a long stick. The net itself should not be deep.\r\n\r\nMany different forms of traps are now made for catching moths, and these\r\nare deservedly coming rapidly into favour. They are generally\r\nconstructed on a 'catch-'em-alive-oh' principle, and have the advantage\r\nthat, after having been set, they may be left alone all night without\r\nany watching, and give an ambitious collector the opportunity of taking\r\ninsects in his garden and searching in the open field both at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOne of these traps may be constructed as follows at the cost of only a\r\nfew pence over the price of a small paraffin lamp. Put together a square\r\nbox, the sides about two feet and the front open, or procure a suitable\r\none from your grocer. Place a paraffin lamp with a bright tin reflector\r\nat the back of this, and make a hole in the top just over the chimney to\r\nallow the heated air to pass out freely. Three sheets of glass are now\r\nto be placed as shown in the sketch (fig. 51), one upright piece\r\ncompletely shutting off the lamp, and two others placed obliquely with a\r\nspace between them just large enough to allow admission. These must be\r\nexactly the width of the box, and should not be permanently fixed, but\r\nsimply resting on small wooden supports nailed on to the sides. When\r\nrequired for use, it is only necessary to light up the lamp, strew some\r\ndead leaves on the bottom of the box, and put the sheets in their\r\nplaces. It will be seen at once that the angles at which they are placed\r\nwill direct all light-seekers into the lower compartment, whence they\r\nare not at all likely to find their way out again; and after vain\r\nendeavours to reach the light they finally settle down on the sides of\r\nthe box or seek shelter among the dead leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--A TRAP FOR CATCHING MOTHS.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally it happens that an entomologist is lucky enough to claim\r\nthe friendship of a person who, from the nature of his calling, is\r\npeculiarly well qualified to render him great assistance. Thus a\r\nfriendly lamplighter, expert and patient in the use of the cyanide\r\nbottle or pill box, is capable of giving valuable aid at times; and the\r\nkeeper of a lighthouse has it in his power to capture many a gem that is\r\nseldom seen on the wing; but, although much may be done by means of\r\nthese and other stationary lights, this kind of work does not compare\r\nfavourably with the night rambles of a naturalist in the very haunts of\r\nthe objects of his search.\r\n\r\nFor such out-door work in search of moths a good lantern is essential.\r\nAn ordinary 'bull's-eye' is almost useless, for, although it\r\nconcentrates a good light on certain objects, the narrow range of its\r\nrays constitutes a strong objection to its use for entomological work.\r\nFor this purpose it is necessary that the rays of light not only pass in\r\nfront of you, but also shoot off right and left to warn you of the\r\napproach of a moth before it is too late to wield the net. This wide\r\nrange may be obtained by means of three flat glass sides, or, better\r\nstill, by a bent plate glass front.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this you must go out provided with your net, killing\r\nbottle, and a number of pill boxes. Choose your night according to the\r\nhints already given, and if you are on the look-out for any particular\r\nspecies, be careful that the date of your outing is well timed, making\r\nany necessary allowances for the forwardness or backwardness of the\r\nseason, for a moth that is generally due on a certain _average_ time of\r\nthe year may appear some weeks sooner if the preceding weeks have been\r\nunusually warm, or its emergence may be delayed considerably by the\r\nprevalence of cold east winds or a late frost.\r\n\r\nMake up your mind as to the field of your operations before you start,\r\nand if possible choose a route that will carry you through a variety of\r\nsituations, so that you may pass the favourite haunts of a number of\r\ndifferent species. Clearings in woods with an abundant undergrowth,\r\nwaste places with plenty of tall and rank vegetation, overgrown railway\r\nbanks, clover fields, the flowery borders of corn fields, plantations in\r\nparks, heaths and moors, sheltered and overgrown hollows such as chalk\r\npits and old disused quarries, reed and marsh land, all these are good\r\nlocalities, each one inhabited by its own peculiar species, and if your\r\nroute runs through a fair variety of such places you may, other things\r\nbeing equally favourable, depend on a good catch.\r\n\r\nSee that your time also is well chosen. Of course you cannot say exactly\r\nwhat the night will be till it actually comes, and, as you have to start\r\noff before it is dark, you must consider the probabilities of the future\r\nfrom the present condition of the air. Let it be a night when a bright\r\nmoon is not due, and if it follow a warm and moist day with a south or\r\nsouth-west wind, or if drizzly, so much the better; but let your feet be\r\nshod with boots that will permit you to wade through moist herbage\r\nwithout danger, and take a waterproof if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to be on your hunting ground before twilight sets\r\nin, as a number of moths venture out before the sun has disappeared; and\r\nthen you can work on till midnight if you feel inclined, or even extend\r\nyour labours till the early hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nBefore dusk you will meet with many of the little _Tortrices_ (page 298)\r\nin sheltered spots, and a little later the _Geometrae_ and Hawks will be\r\non the wing. Thus, before dark, you may make good use of your net,\r\ndealing with your captures just in the same way as recommended in the\r\ncase of butterflies.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, however, the lantern will have to be brought to your\r\nassistance in making known the whereabouts of the later species,\r\nconsisting chiefly of the _Noctuae_, many of which do not make their\r\nappearance till it is quite dark. If now you carry your lantern in your\r\nleft hand, your work will be rendered somewhat difficult and tedious,\r\nfor, although one hand is sufficient to manage the net properly, you are\r\ncompelled to rest your light on the ground every time you make a\r\ncapture, as it is impossible to box your specimens unless both hands are\r\nquite free. This difficulty is easily overcome by suspending the lantern\r\nby means of a string or strap placed round your neck, allowing it to\r\nhang on your chest; and a further advantage is gained by having a second\r\nstrap round your chest to prevent it from swaying about with every\r\nmovement of your body. This arrangement gives you both hands perfectly\r\nfree during the whole time, and also prevents the necessity of\r\ncontinually bringing yourself into a stooping or kneeling posture while\r\nyou are examining or boxing the specimens you have netted.\r\n\r\nThere are now two courses open to you. Either you can kill and pin the\r\nmoths as you catch them, fixing each one securely in the collecting box,\r\nor you may simply shut each one in a separate pill box and leave the\r\nremainder of the work to be done at home. If the ordinary collecting box\r\nonly is used, a little of your time is necessarily occupied in pinning\r\nand transferring, and if many insects are about such an occupation may\r\nappear to you to be a waste of valuable time. But this is not all. Often\r\nand often will you find that while thus engaged a splendid moth will\r\ncome and flutter round your light; and, before you have time to drop\r\nyour collecting box and pick up the net, the fine creature you would\r\nhave prized has darted off again. This certainly seems to speak in\r\nfavour of the pill-boxing method, but it must be remembered that a few\r\nof the moths will continue to flutter after they have been boxed, so\r\nthat when you arrive home they are more or less damaged, a large number\r\nof the scales that once adorned the wings now lying on the sides and\r\nbottom of the boxes. Perhaps the best plan is to take both the\r\ncollecting box and also a quantity of pill boxes, and a little\r\nexperience will soon show you which is the better accommodation for\r\ncertain kinds.\r\n\r\nParticular attention must be paid to flowers, some of which are very\r\nattractive to the _Noctuae_ especially. Sallow blossom in spring and ivy\r\nbloom in autumn should be carefully and frequently watched, and at\r\nother times the blossoms of heather, ragwort, bramble, clover, and\r\nvarious other flowers must be searched.\r\n\r\nAs you cast the rays of the lantern on the feasting moths some will\r\nprove themselves very wary, and dart away at your approach; but others\r\nwill take but little notice of your advance, and will continue to suck\r\nthe sweet nectar, their eyes glaring like living sparks.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the _Noctuae_ thus engaged are easily pill-boxed or caught\r\ndirect in the cyanide bottle; but a few of the more restless species are\r\nto be made sure of only by a sweep of the net. Some will feign death as\r\nsoon as disturbed, and allow themselves to drop among the foliage, where\r\nfurther search is generally fruitless.\r\n\r\nAnother common difficulty arises from the inconvenient height of many of\r\nthe attractive blossoms--often so great that it is impossible to reach\r\nthem with the net, and very difficult to direct the rays of your lantern\r\non them. This is particularly the case with sallow and ivy, the flowers\r\nof which are two rich sources of supply to the entomologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--NET AND LANTERN FOR TAKING MOTHS FROM HIGH\r\nBLOSSOMS.]\r\n\r\nThose who intend giving special attention to these blossoms should be\r\nprovided with some form of apparatus that will enable them to extend\r\ntheir operations as high as possible. Perhaps the most effective\r\narrangement is the well-known combination here figured. It consists of a\r\nlong and stout stick, at the top of which is a tubular joint (fig. 52)\r\nthat might be termed a T-piece were it not that the smaller part does\r\nnot stand out at right angles to the other. In this is fixed, in a\r\nstraight line with the stick, a short rod on which hangs a lantern--an\r\nordinary bull's-eye answers well here; and in the smaller tube is\r\nanother short rod carrying a shallow basin-shaped net, and of such a\r\nlength that the net is just in advance of the lantern.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this arrangement will strike you as being very\r\nunsatisfactory, there being no kind of trap to prevent the escape of the\r\ninsects. But it must be remembered that moths are more or less addicted\r\nto habits of intemperance--that they will hold on to the supply of the\r\nsweet fluid they enjoy till they are ready to drop with intoxication.\r\nThis being the case, some will fall into your net as soon as they are\r\nstartled by the sudden and near approach of the glare of your lamp, and\r\nothers are easily _made_ to fall therein by gently tapping the\r\nflower-bearing stems from below with the edge of the ring.\r\n\r\nHaving become acquainted with this very sad propensity, which thus\r\nbrings ruin to so many unfortunate moths, can we not yet further turn\r\ntheir evil doings to our own profit in our endeavours to become\r\nacquainted with their structure and history? Most certainly we can. All\r\nwe have to do is to distribute in their haunts a bountiful supply of\r\nsome artificial intoxicant such as they love, and then lie in wait for\r\nthe victims that fall a prey to our snare. This process is known to\r\nentomologists as 'sugaring,' and is a splendid means of securing an\r\nabundance of species, often including some rare ones that are scarcely\r\nto be obtained by any other plan. Let us now inquire into the _modus\r\noperandi_ of this interesting operation.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to prepare the luring sweetmeat. Supply\r\nyourself with a quantity of strong, dark treacle, and also some dark\r\nbrown sugar; always remembering, in the selection of these viands, that\r\nodour rather than purity is to be the guide. The best kinds of sugar are\r\nthose very dark and moist brands imported in a raw state from the West\r\nIndies, nothing being better than that known as 'Jamaica Foots.'\r\n\r\nMix about equal quantities of these with a little stale beer, and boil\r\nand stir till all the sugar is dissolved. The consistency of the mixture\r\nshould be such that it will work well with a brush when used as a\r\npaint--not too thick, nor so thin that it is easily absorbed by the\r\nsubstance on which it is 'painted,' nor must it be in such a fluid\r\ncondition that it easily runs.\r\n\r\nWhen satisfied on these points, transfer the mixture to a tin canister,\r\nsee it properly covered, and set it aside as your 'stock' from which you\r\ncan draw supplies as required. Now secure an ordinary painter's brush of\r\nconvenient size, and a number of strips of linen or other rag, each one\r\nof which is fastened to a hook formed of bent wire. These items,\r\ntogether with the usual lantern, collecting box, pill boxes, and killing\r\nbottle, complete your outfit for the sugaring expedition.\r\n\r\nWhen the selected time for operations has arrived, take sufficient\r\n'sugar' for your night's work, mix it well with sufficient strong rum to\r\ngive it a very decided odour, and start off at dusk with this and the\r\nother requisites just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe night chosen should be warm and calm, with a rather damp atmosphere,\r\nand no moon preferred. Let your locality be a well-wooded one;\r\nabounding, if possible, with giant oaks and other trees, and containing\r\nopen spaces with plenty of underwood and rank herbage. Such localities\r\nare to be met with at their best in forest lands, and if you would do\r\nwonders at sugaring you cannot do better than arrange for spending your\r\nholidays in such a spot as the New Forest, taking with you sufficient\r\n'sugar' for several nights' work.\r\n\r\nHaving reached a likely spot of no very great extent, you prepare for\r\nreal work. Light up the lamp, and get out your sugaring tin and brush\r\nready for action. Take your course along some definite track that you\r\nare sure to remember, painting vertical strips of sugar, about a foot\r\nlong, on the trunks of trees or on palings, and hanging strips of rag\r\nthat have just been steeped in the sugar on the branches of small trees\r\nand shrubs where you do not find good surfaces for the brush.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying yourself concerning the amount of sugar distributed,\r\nretrace your steps, examining every patch of sugar as you go. It will\r\nnot be long before signs of life appear. Earwigs, spiders, centipedes\r\nand slugs will soon search out the luscious feast, but unless the time\r\nand the locality are ill chosen, the lantern will soon reveal a goodly\r\nnumber of moths, with eyes glaring like little balls of fire, greedily\r\ndevouring the bounteous repast. These will consist chiefly of _Noctuae_,\r\nbut _Sphinges_, _Geometrae_ and numerous small species also join the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nSome will exhibit a restless disposition, either darting off before you\r\nmake a close approach, or keeping their wings in rapid vibration as if\r\nto be fully prepared for a hasty retreat when occasion demands. These\r\nmust receive your attention first; and, having secured them, proceed to\r\nbox as many as you require of the more lazy and gluttonous species.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, moths thus engaged are easily pill-boxed, but the livelier\r\nones will not submit to such treatment without attempting to escape. The\r\nbest way to secure these is either to cover them with the opened cyanide\r\nbottle (or its substitute), and replace the cork as soon as a favourable\r\nopportunity occurs; or to perform the same feat with a glass-bottomed\r\npill box.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the latter over the ordinary boxes will be seen at\r\nonce. After the insect is covered, its movements can be watched, and so\r\na favourable opportunity can be seized for snapping on the lid.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, some moths feign death when in danger, allowing\r\nthemselves to fall in places where they are often quite safe from\r\ncapture. Others allow themselves to fall simply because they have so\r\ngorged themselves with the intoxicating sweet that they can no longer\r\nmaintain their hold. Both these classes of sugar seekers may easily be\r\nsecured by means of a net commonly known as the 'sugaring net.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--FRAME FOR THE SUGARING NET.]\r\n\r\nThis implement is so simple in its construction that anyone can easily\r\nmake his own. The frame may consist of two straight wires or canes fixed\r\nin a metal Y, and the other ends joined by a piece of strong string or\r\ncatgut as shown in fig. 54. The net itself need not be deep. As soon as\r\nyou reach a tree where moths are feeding on the sugar, press the string\r\nof the net against the bark just below them. The string at once assumes\r\nthe form of the trunk so well that you may be sure of every insect that\r\nfalls while you are boxing.\r\n\r\nFor this work both hands must be free, and this is easily managed in\r\nspite of the number of appliances called into service. The lantern is\r\nslung round your neck and secured by a strap round the chest. The\r\n'sugaring net' has a very short stick, and just while you are engaged in\r\nboxing specimens, it may be gently held against the trunk by a slight\r\npressure of the body. But such precautions as these are necessary only\r\nwhen the night worker is out alone. There are many circumstances,\r\nhowever, that render the work of two or more in company much more\r\nenjoyable than that of a single-handed entomologist. The labours are\r\nconsiderably expedited where a division enables each one of the night\r\nramblers to take a particular portion of the work; and if there is such\r\na person as a nervous entomologist, that individual should on no account\r\ngo a sugaring in lonely spots on dark nights. Every rustling leaf gives\r\nsuch a one a start; all footsteps are those of approaching disturbers of\r\nthe peace; and when at last the invisible landowner or his keeper,\r\nattracted by the mysterious movements of the lamp, greets him with his\r\ngruff 'What's your business here?' then for the moment he forgets his\r\nenchanting hobby and wishes he were safely at home.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly advisable to take a friend, whether an entomologist or\r\nnot, on such expeditions; and if you intend working on private grounds,\r\nalways make previous arrangements with the property owner, that you may\r\nfear no foes and dread no surprises; for a sugarer is far more sure of\r\nsuccess in his work if he keeps a cool head and has nothing to think\r\nabout for the time being but his moths and his boxes.\r\n\r\nA few hours at this interesting employment pass away very rapidly, and\r\nwhen midnight arrives there is often no great desire to leave off,\r\nespecially when it is known that some species of moths are not very busy\r\ntill very late at night. Still it is not advisable to surfeit oneself\r\nwith even the sweets of life. Perhaps it is better as a rule to work the\r\nearly species only on one night, and reserve another for the later ones.\r\nThe searchings are then always carried on with vigour throughout, and\r\nthe labours that are thus never made laborious ever retain their\r\nattractiveness in the future.\r\n\r\nIt has often been observed that, when sugaring has been carried on for a\r\nfew successive nights in the same locality, the success is greater each\r\nnight than on the one preceding it. Hence it is a common practice to\r\nwork a chosen 'run' for two, three, or more nights in succession; and\r\nsome collectors even go so far as to lay on the bait for a night or two\r\nprevious to starting work. For the same reason it is often advisable to\r\ncontinue the use of a fairly productive beat rather than to wander in\r\nsearch of a new one.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of large towns one may often meet with patches of\r\nsugared bark that mark the course and extent of a brother entomologist's\r\nbeat, and such are valuable to an inexperienced amateur in that they\r\ngive him some idea of the nature of the localities that are chosen by\r\nmore expert collectors. But it must be remembered that each entomologist\r\nhas a moral right to a run he has baited, and that it is considered\r\nungentlemanly, if not unjust, to take insects from sugar laid by\r\nanother. I have sometimes seen cards, bearing the names of the\r\ncollectors and the date of working, tacked on to baited trees and\r\nfences, thus establishing their temporary exclusive rights to the use of\r\ntheir runs. Such precautions are not necessary in large tracts of forest\r\nland, where the choice of runs is practically unlimited.\r\n\r\nThere are two other modes of capture available to the moth\r\ncollector--the use of decoy females, and the employment of 'sugar\r\ntraps'--and both these may be used on the sugaring run, or at other\r\ntimes either in the woods or in your own garden.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful acuteness of the sense by which the males of certain\r\nspecies are enabled to seek out the females has already been alluded to,\r\nand the possession of a suitable decoy will often bring you a number of\r\nbeautiful admirers without the least trouble, except that taken in\r\nsecuring the decoy and preparing her temporary abode. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the female moth be one that has recently emerged, and\r\nconsequently you had better secure her in one of her earlier stages,\r\neither by previous rearing or by collecting the pupae.\r\n\r\nA little cage composed of a framework of wire covered with gauze must\r\nnow be made. Perhaps the simplest pattern is that illustrated. Here the\r\ngauze is attached to two wire rings, only a few inches in diameter, and\r\nsuspended by a string. Such a cage answers every purpose in the field,\r\nand has the advantage of folding into an exceedingly small space when\r\nnot in use. It may be suspended in your garden or taken into the field\r\nwhenever you have a suitable decoy at your disposal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--CAGE FOR DECOY FEMALES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--A SUGAR TRAP.]\r\n\r\nThe sugar trap may be of much the same pattern as that in which a light\r\nis used, but if intended for field work it should be of a convenient\r\nsize for portability. A lighter and far more convenient form may be\r\nconstructed as follows:\r\n\r\nProcure a large cylindrical tin box, and cut a circular piece of\r\nperforated zinc just small enough to drop into it. Then make two wire\r\nrings, one a _little larger_ than the top of the tin, and the other only\r\nabout an inch in diameter. Next make a conical net of leno, open at both\r\nends, and of such a size that the two rings may form the frames of its\r\ntwo extremities. When the trap is required for use, cut a circular\r\npiece of flannel or other absorbent, steep it in sugar that has just\r\nbeen flavoured with rum, and place it in the bottom of the tin. Then\r\nplace a few pebbles of equal size around the sides to support the zinc\r\npartition, drop in the partition, and then allow the net to hang on the\r\nrim as shown in the sketch.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement will explain itself. The moths, attracted by the sweet\r\nperfume, flutter about in the net till at last they find their way\r\nthrough the small ring. Once in, they make further attempts to reach the\r\nsugar; and, at last, finding all efforts fruitless, and, like Paddy at\r\nthe fair, not being able to discover the 'entrance out,' they finally\r\nsettle down in a disappointed mood awaiting your pleasure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps another word of explanation is necessary here. Why not allow the\r\npoor creatures to reach the sugar that attracted them to the spot? The\r\nreason is this. They sometimes gorge themselves to such an extent that\r\ntheir bodies, dilated to the fullest capacity with syrup, are a bit\r\ntroublesome when the insects are placed in the cabinet. It is therefore\r\nadvisable to see that the zinc is so far above the sugar that the moths\r\nare unable to reach the latter by thrusting their extended proboscides\r\nthrough the perforations. A few dead leaves scattered on the zinc is\r\nalso a useful addition, since it affords shelter to such of the insects\r\nas prefer it.\r\n\r\nThis is a very useful trap to keep in one's garden throughout the\r\nseason. It may not attract large numbers, but it has the advantage that\r\nit requires no watching. It is simply necessary to set it at dusk, and\r\nremove the captives in the morning or at your leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_COLLECTING OVA, LARVAE, AND PUPAE_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that insects should, as a rule, be set as soon\r\nas possible after their capture; and it would therefore seem that this\r\nis the proper place for instructions in this part of the work. But it so\r\nhappens that butterflies and moths are to be obtained by means other\r\nthan those already described, and we shall therefore consider these\r\nprevious to the study of the various processes connected with the\r\nsetting and preserving of our specimens.\r\n\r\nWere we to confine our attention to the capture of the perfect forms\r\nonly, our knowledge of the _Lepidoptera_ would be scanty indeed, for we\r\nshould then be ignorant of the earlier stages of the creatures' lives,\r\nand have no opportunity of witnessing the wonderful transformations\r\nthrough which they have to pass.\r\n\r\nSuch an imperfect acquaintance with butterflies and moths will, I hope,\r\nnot satisfy the readers of these pages; so it is intended, in the next\r\ntwo chapters, to give a little assistance to those who would like to\r\nknow how to set to work at the collection of their eggs and larvae, how\r\nto search for the pupae, and how to rear the insects from the stage at\r\nwhich they are acquired till they finally emerge in the perfect form.\r\n\r\nThese portions of an entomologist's work certainly take up a great deal\r\nof his time, and also require much patience and perseverance; but the\r\nadvantages derived cannot be over-estimated, for in addition to the\r\nknowledge gained of the early stages of insect life, this kind of work\r\nwill enable him to place in his cabinet a number of gems he would\r\notherwise have not and probably know not. Occasionally a prize may be\r\nobtained in the form of a cluster of eggs (_ova_) of a rare species, in\r\nmany instances the larvae are to be obtained with comparative ease, while\r\nthe perfect insects of the same species are not often seen or not easily\r\ncaptured, and many a rare pupa has been dug out of its hiding place\r\nduring a season when the entomologist had but little other work to\r\noccupy his time.\r\n\r\nThese and other similar subjects we shall now consider in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collecting Ova_\r\n\r\nThe collection of ova may be carried on more or less throughout the\r\nyear. A number of moths are out in February, and even in January if the\r\nweather is mild. These soon lay their eggs, which are hatched about the\r\ntime that the buds of the food plant are breaking. From this time till\r\nlate in the summer the ova of various species are being deposited, the\r\naverage period from laying to hatching being from two to three weeks.\r\nThen, during the autumn, when the leaves of food plants are turning\r\nbrown and crisp, ova are still being laid, but these remain unchanged\r\ntill the new buds of the following spring are bursting.\r\n\r\nOf course if you intend searching for the ova of particular species you\r\nmust previously ascertain the favourite haunts of those species, become\r\nacquainted with their food plants, and also with the season or seasons\r\nduring which the eggs are laid. But the few following hints will suffice\r\nas general instructions for the search.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all cases we must expect to find ova on the food plants of the\r\nrespective species, but at times, especially with certain moths, we may\r\ncome across them in the most unlikely spots. Thus, it sometimes happens\r\nthat a moth settles on a street lamp, and lays her eggs on the framework\r\nround the glass, or even on the glass itself. The same thing may take\r\nplace on the sash or glass of a brightly lighted window.\r\n\r\nSuch occurrences, however, we must regard as accidental and\r\ncomparatively rare, and therefore we confine our searchings for ova to\r\nthe food plants of the species we require.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the under sides of the leaves will yield the most, but we have\r\nalready noticed (page 18) that some moths leave their eggs exposed on\r\nthe upper surface. Again, some larvae feed on flowers and seeds and\r\nfruit, and the eggs of such are deposited on these parts. Those insects\r\nwhich feed on the leaves of shrubs and trees often lay their eggs on\r\ntrunks, branches and twigs. Sometimes these are laid singly, sometimes\r\nin dense clusters; and it is not unusual to find them arranged in rings\r\nor spirals with great regularity. When examining the trunks of trees for\r\nova it is necessary to look well into the crevices of the bark, for some\r\ninsects take particular care to lay them in deep sheltered chinks; but\r\nothers take no such precautions, and deposit them on exposed ridges or\r\nplain surfaces where they are easily discovered.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty of the ova collector lies in the fact that many insects\r\nlay on the upper branches of large trees. Of course a search for these\r\nis out of the question; but in places where the trees have been cut down\r\na few years previously, and where a consequent undergrowth has\r\ndeveloped, there are considerable chances of success with these species.\r\nYoung saplings of trees often yield well, especially in places where\r\ntall trees of the same species are absent. It may be mentioned, too,\r\nthat some moths (page 294) actually lay their eggs beneath the surface\r\nof water, depositing them on the under surfaces of floating pond weeds;\r\nand others (page 298) even enter the nests of wasps and bees for the\r\nsame purpose. It is clear, then, from these few remarks, that the work\r\nof an ambitious collector of insects' eggs is by no means a monotonous\r\ntask; for his employment takes him into the meadows and woods, leads him\r\nto the banks of ponds, and even compels him to tear down banks and\r\nhedges for the nests of _Hymenoptera_ at the risk of a sting or two.\r\n\r\nOne of the most productive sources of eggs is undoubtedly the possession\r\nof captured females. When you are out netting butterflies you often see\r\na female that is evidently engaged in her matronly duties. Instead of\r\nseeking food from the various flowers in her path, she pays attention\r\nonly to the foliage, looking out a suitable leaf on which to deposit her\r\neggs. Should you meet with an insect thus engaged which you would like\r\nto rear at home, or of which you would like to know the egg, secure it\r\nin a perforated pill box with a leaf of the proper plant; and it will\r\noften supply you with abundance of eggs for your purpose, in many cases\r\ndepositing them in the box before you arrive home. The eggs of numerous\r\nspecies of moths are also to be easily obtained from captured females.\r\n\r\nSome insects do not seem inclined to deposit their eggs in captivity as\r\nfreely as when at large, and in order to induce them to do so we must,\r\nas far as possible, put them in their natural conditions. Let them have\r\nplenty of room, and supply them with fresh twigs of their food plants,\r\nkept green by standing them in vessels of water. It is also advisable,\r\nsupposing you are not well acquainted with the dispositions of the\r\nspecies you have, to keep a portion of the box well shaded from direct\r\nsunlight, and allow another part to be as bright as possible; for some\r\nspecies will not lay in a bright light, while others will not do so\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nAgain, while some deposit their eggs within a few hours of quitting the\r\npupa case, others do not lay for several days. With regard to the\r\nlatter, it is frequently necessary to feed them while in captivity, by\r\nplacing in the box a piece of rag or sponge that has been dipped in\r\nhoney or syrup.\r\n\r\nEach batch of ova should be carefully examined with a view to knowing\r\nthem by sight on a future occasion. A sketch should be made in your note\r\nbook, showing every detail that you can make out with the aid of a good\r\nlens. Then observations concerning the season, colour of the eggs, the\r\nsituation in which deposited, arrangement, and any other useful\r\nparticulars, should be entered.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter some hints will be given concerning the management\r\nof ova and the rearing of the larvae from the time of hatching.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collecting Larvae_\r\n\r\nThis occupation is generally far more productive to the entomologist\r\nthan searching for ova. The latter are very small, usually well\r\nconcealed, and to be detected only by a careful scrutinising use of the\r\neyes; but the superior size of the larvae, the frequent bright colouring,\r\nand the fact that they are easily beaten from their hold, render the\r\nsearchings of their hunters comparatively easy and fruitful.\r\n\r\nBefore setting out on a larva-hunting expedition, there are a few\r\nrequisites to prepare. These include not only the implements for your\r\nwork in the field, but also the cages in which you intend to rear your\r\nlittle captives. The latter are described a little later on under the\r\nhead 'Rearing Lepidoptera,' and the former we will now briefly\r\nsummarise.\r\n\r\nThe outfit must consist of a quantity of suitable boxes, a stout hooked\r\nstick, a strong net, and a white material to place under the herbage\r\nwhile you are 'beating.'\r\n\r\n'Larva boxes' are usually made of zinc, and have little sliding doors in\r\nthe lids, so that the lids need not be removed while out of doors after\r\nthe fragment of the required food plant has been inserted. Such boxes\r\nare not by any means essential. Small tin boxes will answer all purposes\r\nnearly as well, providing a number of small holes be made in them for\r\nthe admission of air. Chip boxes are also fairly satisfactory, but these\r\nalso should be perforated. The best way to do this is to push a red-hot\r\niron wire through the chip, making about half a dozen small holes in\r\neach box. This method will give you clean holes of a uniform size\r\nwithout otherwise injuring the boxes.\r\n\r\nMetal boxes possess the advantage that they keep the food plants moist\r\nfor a long time, while chip boxes allow them to dry rather rapidly. Yet\r\nthere are some larvae that do far better in the latter, since such a\r\nquantity of moisture exudes through their skins that they soon become\r\nuncomfortably wet if their apartment is not well ventilated. Under these\r\ncircumstances perhaps it is better to take a supply of both, so that\r\nchanges may be made as found necessary.\r\n\r\nOne grave objection to chip boxes, however, is the weakness of the\r\nmaterial. They are easily crushed by pressure, and a bottom or a top\r\ndisc of wood often falls out; but this is easily overcome by gluing\r\nnarrow strips of calico round the top and bottom edges. Chip boxes\r\nshould always be treated in this way, and they will then last five or\r\nsix times as long.\r\n\r\nYour supply of boxes should always include one large one of metal in\r\nwhich to bring home a supply of food for the larvae. If you have a\r\nbotanist's vasculum, by all means take it, for nothing can serve this\r\npurpose better. If not, any rather large square tin box will do, and\r\nthis may be carried in your satchel, or a couple of hooks may be\r\nsoldered to it so that a leather strap can be fixed for slinging it over\r\nyour shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe net required is that commonly known as the 'sweep net.' It must be\r\nvery strong, for it has to submit to rather rough usage. The frame must\r\nbe made of thick wire; and the bag, which need not be more than a foot\r\ndeep, should be of strong calico or holland.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the white material previously mentioned. This may be\r\na square of calico, hemmed round the edges. Nothing is more convenient\r\nthan this, as it occupies but little room in the pocket when not in use,\r\nif neatly folded. The material need not be thick, but the larger it is\r\nthe better. Many prefer a white umbrella or an ordinary umbrella with a\r\nwhite lining, but as this is only a matter of taste and convenience you\r\nmust decide for yourself as to which you will use.\r\n\r\nIf your field of operations is only a little way from your head\r\nquarters, and quantity of luggage therefore not a serious consideration,\r\nyou may provide yourself with a heavy mallet, loaded if necessary with a\r\npound or two of lead. This will prove very useful in shaking larvae from\r\ntrees and large branches. Lastly, take a pencil and a note book or\r\nwriting paper for your observations in the field.\r\n\r\nNow for the choice of the season. Larvae are to be found all the year\r\nround. Early in the spring, as soon as the buds are bursting, some break\r\nout of the eggs recently laid by the moths that appear in February and\r\nMarch. Later on, during April and May, a host of both butterflies and\r\nmoths are busy arranging for their broods. Then, throughout the whole of\r\nthe summer, thousands of caterpillars of all sorts and sizes are to be\r\nmet with everywhere. And finally, during the bleak winter months, you\r\nmay amuse yourself by digging the hybernators out of their hiding places\r\nwhere they rest themselves till the spring sun again calls them out to\r\nrefresh them with the young and tender leaves of a new year. Thus,\r\nunless you are merely intending to search out certain species you happen\r\nto require, there is not much difficulty in settling on the season.\r\n\r\nThe day selected should be dry, for your work lies among the herbage of\r\nbanks, meadows, and woods, and nothing is more unpleasant than wading\r\nthrough a wet and dense vegetation, or beating down on yourself a shower\r\nof large drops from the branches of trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the hunting ground, the first thing to do is to look out\r\nfor _signs_ of the presence of larvae rather than for the larvae\r\nthemselves. Healthy vegetation with sound leaves must be passed by as\r\nuntenanted; but the presence of partly eaten foliage immediately arouses\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nA little experience will soon enable you to distinguish between the\r\nravages of larvae and of slugs, snails, wasps, &c. Some of the smaller\r\nlarvae certainly eat out clean holes like those cut by _Hymenopterous_\r\ninsects, but as a rule they bite away at the edges, leaving the midrib\r\nand the larger veins standing out almost naked.\r\n\r\nBy looking well into the edges of the eaten leaves, it is easy to see\r\nwhether the marauders have been recently at work. If they are dried up\r\nand discoloured, it is not of much use to search; but if still green and\r\nmoist, you may feel almost sure that the hungry larvae are not far off.\r\n\r\nIn this case you will carefully turn over the leaves to examine the\r\nunder sides, and also the leaf stalks and branches or stems; but you\r\nmust be prepared for all kinds of protective mimicry. Little green\r\ncaterpillars will be seen lying on the midrib or veins, so straight and\r\nso still that they are scarcely perceptible. Others are snugly tucked in\r\na depression of a leaf with the same result. Then we must also be\r\nprepared for the artful little tricks of the larvae of _Geometrae_ (p.\r\n268), by which they imitate stalks and twigs so closely that a sharp eye\r\nis necessary to discriminate between the two.\r\n\r\nWhile thus searching we may meet with the cast skin of a caterpillar.\r\nThis gives us fresh hopes, and so we continue our careful examination.\r\nAt last, on grasping a leaf in order to turn it over for inspection, we\r\nfeel something hairy or something soft and smooth. But lo! it is gone.\r\nIt is one of those numerous caterpillars that feign death and drop to\r\nthe ground on the slightest sign of danger. We search below for it, but\r\nthe density of the vegetation renders this hopeless, and we are just\r\nabout to start off in search of a more productive locality when we espy\r\na quantity of the excrement of larvae lying on a little bare patch of\r\nground close by. This gives us a new idea. Here is another indication of\r\nthe presence of the creatures we require, one that we can put into\r\npractice; and by-and-by we learn that in many cases this is really the\r\nsurest sign of their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nWe look at these little pellets of excrement, and gain at once some idea\r\nof the _size_ of the larvae that produce them. Then we observe whether\r\nthey are fresh and moist, or dry and stale. If the latter, it is not of\r\nmuch use to examine the leaves above; but if otherwise, there is little\r\ndoubt of our meeting with larvae, as the present position they occupy is\r\nso truly marked. The leaves just over them are carefully examined,\r\neither by turning them over as before described, or, if the height of\r\nthe foliage admits of it, by placing our heads below and looking upward.\r\n\r\nIf we find that the larvae are some of those that endeavour to escape by\r\nfeigning death and allowing themselves to drop at the slightest\r\ndisturbance, the net is always kept beneath the leaves we are touching\r\nin order to intercept them in their downward journey.\r\n\r\nContinuing the search, we meet with leaves that are rolled up and bound\r\nwith silk threads, and others that are drawn together and similarly\r\nbound. These are carefully uncurled and pulled asunder with the result\r\nthat active little larvae are exposed to view, or, it may be, pupae are\r\ndiscovered. In some cases flowers are drawn together in just the same\r\nway, and an examination reveals one or more of the species that prefer\r\npetals and other parts of flowers to the green leaves.\r\n\r\nSilken threads always arouse our suspicions. These may be seen lying on\r\nthe surfaces of leaves, and passing from one leaf to another, or they\r\nmay be hanging perpendicularly from the branches of trees above. In the\r\nlatter case a larva may be frequently seen on the lower extremity of the\r\nfibre, swinging gently in the breeze, and, should we require it, we have\r\nonly to place the open box below for its reception.\r\n\r\nHawthorn and other trees are sometimes seen almost devoid of leaves,\r\nnearly every bit of green having been greedily devoured by a host of\r\nsmall larvae. In such cases we often meet with dense clusters of silk\r\nfibres that may easily be mistaken for spiders' nests. But when we look\r\nmore closely into the structure we observe that we have discovered\r\ninstead nests of gregarious larvae, such a large number being in each\r\nlittle community that the deplorable appearance of the tree is at once\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nA little farther on we meet with a sickly-looking plant in the midst of\r\na number of flourishing individuals of the same species, and stop to\r\nmake inquiries into the cause of this strange occurrence. Is it due to a\r\npoorness of the soil? No, this cannot be the case; for intermingled with\r\nits roots are those of its flourishing companions. We pluck a stunted\r\nand half-shrivelled leaf and examine it. At first we do not notice the\r\ncause of its peculiar condition; but, holding it up to the light, and\r\nlooking _through_ it, we see a number of little galleries that have been\r\neaten out of its internal soft substance, leaving the thin skin\r\n(_epidermis_) almost entirely intact. But nothing more is to be seen.\r\nAnother leaf is examined in exactly the same way; and here we see the\r\nlittle destroyer, lying motionless in its burrow till a gentle pressure\r\napplied against it from outside causes it to wriggle along its narrow\r\npassage. This is the larva of one of the little leaf miners mentioned\r\nagain on page 303.\r\n\r\nReaching a little marshy spot we see a number of water-loving reeds,\r\nmost of them beautifully green and in a flourishing condition, but here\r\nand there in their midst is a poor stunted specimen--another result of\r\nthe ravages of the larvae of one or more moths. An examination of the\r\nblades reveals nothing; but on splitting open the stalk we discover some\r\nlarvae that have already devoured a quantity of the internal pith, and\r\nthus endangered the life of the plant. On inspecting other similar reeds\r\nwe are at first puzzled as to how the larvae could get inside the stems\r\nwithout damaging the outer portion; but at last we see in each one a\r\nlittle discoloured hole that was eaten out by the young caterpillar\r\njust after its escape from the egg. Once within the reed, it found a\r\nplentiful supply of food, and there grew at the expense of the plant\r\nwithout doing any further external damage save by causing a stunted\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the stem eaters we have found are just about full grown.\r\nIf so we examine a number of the stems with a hope that we may find one\r\nor two that are just about to change to the chrysalis state, or even a\r\npupa already formed. By this means we may secure one of the perfect\r\ninsects without the necessity of feeding larvae at home. Such a\r\nconsideration becomes a most important one when it happens that the\r\nrequired food plant is one that cannot be easily obtained.\r\n\r\nClose by the reeds is another water-loving plant in the form of an old\r\nwillow tree. This is always an attractive object to the entomologist, so\r\nit comes in for a share of our inspection. On its leaves we may find\r\nseveral species of the larvae of _Lepidoptera_, including those of some\r\nof our largest insects. But a strange feature catches our eyes as we\r\nhappen to glance at the bark of the tree. Here we see a few holes of\r\ndifferent sizes, about which are a number of little fragments of wood\r\nthat remind us of 'sawdust;' and, examining the ground below, we see\r\nquite a little heap of this dust, looking just as if a carpenter had\r\nbeen at work on the spot.\r\n\r\nThis is not the effect of a saw, however; it is a sure sign of the\r\nravages of wood-eating larvae (p. 224), whose powerful jaws gain them\r\nadmittance into the very hearts of trees, and the application of the\r\nnose to one of the larger holes leaves no doubt of the presence of the\r\nlarge and beautiful caterpillar of the Goat Moth (p. 224).\r\n\r\nIf we require any of these wood-eaters, either for rearing or for\r\npreservation, we must be prepared for a little rather heavy work. A\r\nstrong pocket knife is not sufficient, but with a good chisel the wood\r\ncan be gradually cut away, and the galleries traced, till at last we\r\ncome to the larvae snugly resting in their burrows.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the tree thus tenanted is half decayed, and\r\nconsequently the work is rendered much easier. Also, while tearing away\r\nthe wood, we often meet with a number of cocoons that have been\r\nconstructed by the caterpillars for their winter quarters, or as a\r\nresting place while undergoing their transformations. These are composed\r\nof the wood dust bound together by strong silk fibres, and are often in\r\nsuch a good state of preservation that they form useful illustrations\r\nfor the cabinet.\r\n\r\nAs further aids to larvae searching we may mention that many\r\nspecies--chiefly of the _Noctuae_--hide under the surface of the ground\r\nor among dense and low herbage during the day, and come out to feed only\r\nby night; that many others feed on roots, and are therefore seldom seen\r\nabove the surface of the soil; also that a good number burrow into\r\nfruits, in the interior of which they spend the whole of their larval\r\nstage. The best way to secure the latter is to examine the 'windfalls'\r\nthat lie scattered on orchard lands, for it is a well-known fact that\r\nthe fruits that are infested with larvae generally fall earlier than\r\nothers--a result that must be attributed to the damaging work of the\r\nlarvae themselves.\r\n\r\nAll the larvae collected should be carefully boxed at once, a separate\r\ncompartment being used for each species, and a few fragments of the food\r\nplant being introduced in each case. It is also a good plan to have each\r\nbox previously lined with moss as a further addition to the comfort of\r\nthe captives. Without such a precaution some of the more delicate\r\nspecies are liable to injury during their transmission from field to\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have obtained our larvae by _searching_ only, but there are\r\ntimes and occasions when our boxes may be far more rapidly filled by\r\nmethods that are not such a tax on our time and patience. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, that we reach a bush, the mutilated leaves of which seem to\r\nshow that larvae are present on its branches. We spread our white cloth\r\nor open out the white-lined umbrella just under a selected branch, and\r\nthen tap that branch very smartly with our stick.\r\n\r\nDown comes a host of living creatures! Spiders, larvae, beetles, aphides,\r\nearwigs, and what not, struggling and running about on our white fabric\r\nin all directions, and all mingled with bits of stick, leaves, and\r\nfragments of all kinds. We leave the cloth or the umbrella, as the case\r\nmay be, quite still for a few seconds to allow all the living creatures\r\nto get a good foothold, and then, raising it into a vertical position,\r\nallow all the rubbish to drop off.\r\n\r\nWe can now put the cloth down again, and select as many of the larvae as\r\nwe require, giving our first attention to the nimble runners and loopers\r\nthat are already near the edge and just on the point of making their\r\nescape. This productive method of larva hunting is known as 'beating,'\r\nand is particularly applicable to tall herbs and the lower branches of\r\ntrees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe same principle may be employed in the case of branches that are\r\nquite out of the reach of the stick, but the blows are here applied to\r\nthe trunk, a mallet or some other rather heavy implement taking the\r\nplace of the stick.\r\n\r\nAnother splendid method of securing larvae where mere searching would be\r\ntedious and unproductive, lies in the use of the sweep net described on\r\npage 102. This implement comes into service in waste places that are\r\ncovered with rank vegetation, in clover and hayfields, and in all spots\r\ncovered with low herbs.\r\n\r\nWalking among the vegetation, the net is swept right and left before\r\nyou, and the contents examined at frequent intervals. It is advisable to\r\nwork the different species of herbs separately as far as possible,\r\notherwise there may be some difficulty in the determination of the food\r\nplants of the mixed larvae that the net will contain. If, however, this\r\nplan is impracticable, you may save time by turning out all the\r\n'sweepings' into one large box, leaving the sorting to be done at home\r\nin leisure hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collecting Pupae_\r\n\r\nWe have seen that ova and larvae may be obtained in greater or less\r\nabundance at all times of the year, so variable are the seasons of the\r\ndifferent butterflies and moths. The same remark applies equally well to\r\npupae; but so many of the Lepidoptera spend the winter months in the\r\nchrysalis state that this period may be regarded as the harvest time of\r\nthe pupa hunter.\r\n\r\nA large number of caterpillars undergo their change to the quiescent\r\nstate during the months of August and September, and, of course, remain\r\nin this state until the warm days of the following spring or summer. And\r\nas insects even in the pupal stage have a number of enemies and dangers\r\nto contend with, it is advisable to start your search for them as soon\r\nas possible after they have changed.\r\n\r\nIf you set your mind on searching for particular species, you should\r\nendeavour to ascertain the _usual_ time at which such species pupate;\r\nmake any necessary allowances for the forwardness or backwardness of the\r\nseason, and then allow a week or two for the change to be completed, for\r\ninsects should never be disturbed at times when their metamorphoses are\r\nin progress.\r\n\r\nFor general pupa hunting the best season is undoubtedly from the end of\r\nAugust to the end of October, but there is no reason why the work should\r\nnot be carried on throughout the winter. If, however, you continue your\r\nwork so late, you must not expect nearly as much success as time\r\nadvances. You must remember that entomologists are not the only pupa\r\nhunters. Many hungry birds are always on the look-out for insects, and\r\nseem to enjoy them equally well in all their stages. Those that\r\nhybernate on or under the ground are liable to fall a prey to moles and\r\nbeetles. In addition to these dangers, all pupae are subject to the\r\neffects of extreme cold, dampness, or floods.\r\n\r\nAs regards the choice of a day, very little need be said. Any day that\r\nis sufficiently genial for yourself will do for your work, except that\r\nperiods of hard frost render the ground too hard for digging--the most\r\nprofitable part of the pupa hunter's task.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus required is extremely simple: A satchel or large pockets\r\nfull of small metal or chip boxes, a small garden trowel, and a strong\r\nchisel.\r\n\r\nIf metal boxes are used they should be perforated; in fact, nothing is\r\nbetter than the ordinary larva boxes of the dealers. All the boxes, of\r\nwhatever kind, should be lined with moss previous to starting work.\r\n\r\nThe trowel and chisel do not pack well with a number of small boxes,\r\ntherefore it is a good plan to fix them in a couple of leather sheaths\r\nattached to your belt. In this position they are far more handy for use,\r\nand the boxes are also in less danger of being crushed or damaged, as\r\nthey probably would be if in contact with hard and heavy tools.\r\n\r\nA note book is also a valuable addition to your outfit, as it enables\r\nyou to make memoranda concerning the trees and localities from which you\r\nobtain your pupae.\r\n\r\nThe best localities for pupa hunting are clearings in woods, parks with\r\nnumerous large timber trees, and meadows in which large isolated trees\r\nare scattered; and the best trees include willows, poplars, oaks,\r\nbeeches, birches, elms, and hawthorns.\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do on arriving at the selected hunting ground is\r\nto make at once for isolated trees of large size, and work each one as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFirst examine well the crevices of the bark, for many caterpillars\r\ndescend the tree to within a short distance of the ground, and then seek\r\nout a snug little crevice in which to spend the winter, often protecting\r\nthemselves with silken cocoons, or constructing a neat little shelter of\r\ngnawed fragments of the wood cemented together.\r\n\r\nIf there is any loose bark, very carefully force it out with your\r\nchisel, and examine both its inner surface and the wood from which it\r\nwas removed. The wood thus exposed may reveal openings of the galleries\r\nof wood-eating larvae, in which case, unless the material is too hard to\r\nbe broken up with the chisel, you may be able to trace out a few pupae.\r\nWhere these exist, they are usually to be found very near the entrance,\r\nsometimes even protruding slightly from the opening, for the larvae\r\ngenerally place themselves in this position of easy escape when about to\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nNext give your attention to the moss, if any, covering the lower portion\r\nof the trunk. This affords a very favourite shelter to many species.\r\nTear it off very carefully, beginning at the top, and watch for loose\r\npupae and cocoons as you do so. Then hold the clumps you have removed\r\nover a patch of bare ground or over a spread handkerchief, and pull it\r\nto pieces, in order that any pupae it contains may fall out; also examine\r\nthe fragments carefully for others that may remain attached.\r\n\r\nThis done, the surface of the ground must be examined. Remove all dead\r\nleaves, and watch for pupae that may be sheltered beneath them. If any\r\nloose stones lie on the ground, turn them over. Search well into the\r\nangles between the roots, and if there are any holes or hollows beneath\r\nthem or in the trunk itself, pull out all loose matter within, and\r\n_feel_ gently above and around for cocoons.\r\n\r\nAfter all loose matter has been removed, there still remains the soil\r\nfor examination. If this is very hard and clayey, it is probably useless\r\nto carry the search any farther; also if very wet you need not expect\r\nmuch; but if comparatively dry and friable there are more hopes of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the north and east sides of the trunk are drier than\r\nthose which are exposed to the heavy rains brought by the south and\r\nsouth-west winds, and are consequently more favoured by larvae that are\r\nseeking a resting place for the winter.\r\n\r\nMost larvae seek shelter in the angles between the roots of the trees on\r\nwhich they fed, but a few species seem to prefer the edges rather than\r\nthe corners; and in cases where no such angles are formed at the\r\nsurface, you will do well to examine the earth and turf all round the\r\ntrunk; but it is generally useless to extend the search more than a few\r\ninches from the tree.\r\n\r\nAfter having searched every available nook and corner as far as possible\r\nwithout digging, thrust the trowel obliquely into the soil a few inches\r\nfrom the tree, turn over the sod, and then examine the spot from which\r\nit was removed. Now give your attention to the sod itself. If loose and\r\nfriable, break it up gently, keeping a sharp eye for falling pupae, and\r\nalso for earthen cocoons that are easily mistaken for little lumps of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIf the soil is held together by roots, it must be pulled to pieces, and\r\nthe fragments shaken over a bare piece of ground where the fall of a\r\npupa or cocoon could be easily seen; and if you have removed a grassy\r\nturf, it will be necessary to look between the bases of the blades as\r\nwell as among the roots.\r\n\r\nIn this way you may search round tree after tree, wherever the soil is\r\nof such a character as to allow of the admittance and shelter of larvae.\r\nBut the variability of your success will be quite beyond your\r\ncomprehension. Sometimes you will sight a grand old oak with the most\r\nfavourable anticipations, and consider yourself quite certain of a good\r\nfind when you discover, on a nearer approach, the liberal coating of\r\nmoss that clothes its trunk and the dry sandy soil at its foot; and yet\r\nthe most careful search ends in nothing but disappointment. At other\r\ntimes you try your luck at tree after tree without ever seeing a single\r\npupa or even a cast-off case, and then, when just on the point of\r\ndespairing, you search round another that is apparently much less\r\npromising, and, to your great surprise and delight, a dozen or two are\r\nturned out in a few minutes. Such an occurrence as this is not at all\r\nuncommon, and cannot be satisfactorily explained, but we must take\r\nthings as they come and make the best of them, remembering that pupa\r\nsearching is one of the best of all entomological operations wherewith\r\nto test one's perseverance and patience.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, in conclusion, that the pupae of _Lepidoptera_ are\r\nnever to be found far below the surface of the soil. Generally they\r\nexist, if buried at all, only an inch or two down, and very rarely at a\r\ngreater depth than four inches.\r\n\r\nIn our next chapter we shall learn how to rear the perfect insects from\r\nthe earlier stages we have been considering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_REARING LEPIDOPTERA_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Management of Ova_\r\n\r\nIn the management of insects in all stages the strictest attention must\r\nalways be paid to one general rule on which the success of the work\r\nalmost entirely depends; and that is--keep every specimen as far as\r\npossible under the same conditions as those in which you find it in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nApplying this principle to ova, we store them in airy and light places,\r\nprotected from the direct rays of the sun, and avoid handling and rough\r\ntreatment of any kind. It is also advisable in most cases to maintain a\r\nslight amount of dampness corresponding with that of the open air at the\r\nparticular season of the year.\r\n\r\nThey do not require much space, and it is certainly desirable not to\r\ngive much, otherwise the newly hatched larvae, when their time arrives,\r\nwill actively wander all round their premises in search of food, and\r\ngive you no end of trouble in gathering them up.\r\n\r\nChip boxes are, as a rule, very good and very convenient receptacles for\r\nova. After placing the eggs in these, cover them over with very fine\r\nmuslin, held in place by elastic bands; and label each as far as you can\r\nwith the name of the species contained, and other particulars worth\r\nremembering. The boxes may then be put in front of a window facing\r\nnorth, or in any situation within or out of doors where rain and sun\r\ncannot reach them. A greenhouse is an admirable place in which to keep\r\nthem, the natural dampness of the atmosphere being apparently a\r\nconsiderable assistance to the tiny larvae just as they are striving to\r\nescape from their shell.\r\n\r\nWhatever place is selected, it is absolutely necessary that the ova be\r\ncarefully watched, so that each brood may be supplied with the required\r\nfood plant within a few hours of quitting the shells.\r\n\r\nWhen ova are kept in a warm room, very great inconvenience and even loss\r\nis sometimes caused by the appearance of larvae before the necessary food\r\nplant shows its buds. Yet, on the other hand, it is sometimes a great\r\ngain to the entomologist to get certain broods off early in the season,\r\nproviding the food is at hand; for in this way he can not only get some\r\nof his work over during a slack season, but also, if he desires it,\r\nsecure an additional brood; that is, one brood more than the usual\r\nnumber. Thus, supposing a certain species he is rearing is naturally\r\ndouble-brooded, he can, by judicious management, secure three successive\r\nbroods before the food plant casts its last leaves.\r\n\r\nThis hastening of the natural events of insect life is known as\r\n_forcing_, and merely consists in subjecting the species concerned to a\r\nreasonable amount of artificial heat, such as that of a room in which a\r\nfire is always kept, or of a hothouse.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting at all times to note the dates on which eggs are laid\r\nor collected, and the times at which the young larvae appear. In addition\r\nto this all changes that take place in the colours or forms of eggs\r\nshould be carefully observed; for such changes will assist you in\r\ndistinguishing between fertile and sterile ova, and also enable you to\r\njudge approximately as to the date of the appearance of future broods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rearing Larvae_\r\n\r\nThe main point in connection with the rearing of larvae is certainly the\r\nselection and construction of the cages or their substitutes. For newly\r\nhatched and all very small caterpillars a small bottle with a wide mouth\r\nmakes a very fair abode. Put a layer of sand or sifted soil in the\r\nbottom, fix in this a small twig of the food plant or lay a few leaves\r\non the top, and then, after the larvae have been introduced, cover the\r\ntop with a piece of muslin, held in place by an elastic band.\r\n\r\nThe great drawback with this arrangement is the lack of any provision\r\nfor keeping the food moist and fresh, thus rendering a change necessary\r\nat very frequent intervals; but this may be obviated by using damp sand\r\nas a foundation for the little twig of food plant. With this\r\nimprovement, if you cover the top of the bottle with apiece of glass, a\r\nsaucer, or any impermeable substance, you may keep the twig fresh for\r\nseveral days, generally until the disappearance of the last leaf calls\r\nfor a fresh supply; but it is very doubtful whether the damp atmosphere\r\nresulting from this inclosure is not injurious to the larvae. It\r\ncertainly does not seem to have much influence on some, but the\r\nunhealthy conditions that result must be detrimental to the inmates. It\r\nmust also be remembered that many species require a _dry_ soil in which\r\nto burrow when about to change.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes for the change of food, great care must be taken not\r\nto injure young and small larvae. In many cases they need never be\r\ntouched, for if a fresh twig be placed beside the stale one, they will\r\nreadily find their way to it; and to facilitate this, and also to afford\r\na convenient foothold to those larvae that accidentally fall from the\r\ntwig, the layer of sand at the bottom of the bottle should be covered\r\nwith moss or cocoa-nut fibre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--A LARVA GLASS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--A LARVA GLASS.]\r\n\r\nIf you find it necessary to move the larvae yourself from the stale food,\r\nnever touch them with your fingers, but lift them gently by means of a\r\nsmall camel-hair brush. Larger larvae need never be moved at all. They\r\nwill always search out fresh food for themselves, and the stale may be\r\nremoved after they have quitted it.\r\n\r\nFor rearing larger species ordinary bottles are hardly satisfactory, and\r\nwe must either use large jars or construct cages of some kind.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary bell jar such as is used for covering ferns or for aquaria\r\nmakes a very useful 'larva glass.' Place a small bottle of water at the\r\nbottom, and then introduce sufficient dry clean sand or sifted soil to\r\nreach up to its neck. On the top of this place a layer of moss or\r\ncocoa-nut fibre. Next introduce the food plant, fixing it firmly in the\r\nbottle of water, and plugging up the space between the stem and the rim\r\nwith cotton wool. This precaution is to prevent the larvae from falling\r\ninto the water as they attempt to pass up or down the stem, and the wool\r\nalso helps to keep the twig in a vertical position. The glass is now\r\nready for the caterpillars, but it is advisable to keep a covering of\r\nmuslin or gauze over the top in all cases even though the larvae\r\ncontained are unable to creep up the surface of glass, for the great\r\nenemies of caterpillars--the ichneumon flies--are always on the alert,\r\nand will often take advantage of an open window to 'sting' the larva\r\nrearer's pets.\r\n\r\nAnother form of larva glass can easily be made out of a large glass jar\r\nif you know how to cut off the bottom, or of a chemist's bell jar which\r\nis open both at top and bottom. In this case the bottle of water and the\r\nsoil are arranged as before in a pan of unglazed earthenware, and then\r\ncovered over with the glass. This is shown in fig. 58, and is an\r\nexceedingly convenient larva house, since the lifting of the glass\r\nenables you to get at the insects without any trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--A LARVA CAGE.]\r\n\r\nWood larva cages are very commonly used for the larger species after\r\nthey have attained a fair size and require more food than can be stocked\r\nin bottles and glasses. These cages have glass fronts, either sliding or\r\nin the form of a hinged door, and sides of perforated zinc. They are\r\nkept in stock by all dealers in entomologists' requisites, but equally\r\nuseful ones are easily constructed. If you select a box of suitable size\r\nat the grocer's, cut out large pieces from the lid and sides with a fret\r\nsaw, and fix in the glass and zinc, you will have a cage that will\r\nanswer all purposes.\r\n\r\nThe internal arrangements consist of a shallow tray filled with soil, in\r\nwhich stands the bottle of water for the food, and a layer of moss\r\nsufficiently high to cover the bottle completely.\r\n\r\nA series of such boxes standing on end on a shelf, or hanging on a wall,\r\nwill form a very satisfactory nursery for your pets, and will occupy but\r\nlittle space.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that some larvae burrow into soil when about to\r\nchange, while others creep to a sheltered corner, or suspend themselves\r\nfrom the food plant itself. It will be seen that the larva cage just\r\ndescribed supplies all these demands, and care must be taken not to\r\ndisturb the occupants while they are undergoing their metamorphoses.\r\nThose that suspend themselves on the food plant should be allowed to\r\nremain where they have fixed themselves, and when it is necessary to\r\nremove the stale food in order to give a fresh supply to the later\r\nlarvae, let it be fixed in an airy place where it can be watched till the\r\nperfect insects emerge. Those which suspend themselves on the sides or\r\ntop of the cage, or spin cocoons in the corners, should never be\r\ndisturbed unless you are greatly in want of the same cage for the\r\naccommodation of another brood; and even then it is possible that their\r\npresence will not in any way interfere with the new species. But if\r\ntheir removal becomes a necessity, let it be carried out as carefully as\r\npossible, and not until the change to the pupal stage is known to be\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe species that burrow into the soil or bury themselves in the moss\r\nneed never be disturbed till the rearing season is quite over, and then\r\nthey may be transferred to a box specially kept for the accommodation of\r\npupae.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another method of rearing larvae to which we must refer--a\r\nmethod known as 'sleeving'--particularly useful when you happen to have\r\nthe required food plants in your own garden. The ova or larvae are placed\r\non the plant, the whole or part of which is then covered with a bag or\r\n'sleeve' of gauze. The larvae thus imprisoned have the full benefit of\r\nfresh air and light, and are also free from the attacks of ichneumon\r\nflies. They have a fair amount of liberty, and yet cannot get beyond\r\nyour reach; also abundance of fresh food without further trouble on the\r\npart of the rearer.\r\n\r\nBut even this arrangement is not perfection. It will not suit the night\r\nfeeders that like to hide beneath the soil during the day, and it\r\ninterferes somewhat with the burrowing tendencies of those which pupate\r\nunderground. These little difficulties, however, can be overcome by\r\nplacing the food plants in large pots or tubs of soil, and tying the\r\nmouth of the 'sleeve' round the outside of this utensil. If this cannot\r\nbe done, those insects that pupate underground must be removed from the\r\nplant when their restless disposition shows that the changing time has\r\narrived, and then be transferred to a box of soil where they can find\r\nthe seclusion they seek.\r\n\r\nThe larvae that hybernate throughout the winter are rather more\r\ntroublesome, especially those which are inclined to take a ramble on\r\ncertain mild days in search of food when none is at hand. Still there is\r\nno reason why even a beginner should not attempt the rearing of these.\r\nThey will require food in the autumn until the cold weather sets in, and\r\nagain early in spring as soon as the new leaves appear; but this is not\r\nof much consequence to those who reside in districts where the required\r\nfood plants abound.\r\n\r\nWood feeders also require some special treatment and precautions, and\r\nthe successful rearing of some is a matter of no little difficulty. A\r\nwooden cage is, of course, quite out of the question with these, unless\r\nyou wish to test the power of their jaws. They must be kept in large\r\npots or jars, covered over with wire gauze or perforated zinc, and\r\nsupplied with fresh stems or logs of wood, or with moist sawdust fresh\r\nfrom their favourite tree. A few of them--the 'Goat' (page 224), for\r\nexample--will eat dead and rotting wood, and may be fed on old palings\r\nand other waste providing the right kind is selected.\r\n\r\nThe troubles and disappointments of larva rearers are numerous and\r\nvaried, and commence with the earliest moments of the young insects.\r\nEven the hatching period sometimes proves a trial, for it occasionally\r\nhappens that the young larva has not sufficient strength to bite its way\r\nthrough the shell that surrounds it, and dies with nothing but the\r\nsurface of its head exposed to view. This may be the result of keeping\r\nthe ova in too dry a spot, the shell having become too hard and horny\r\nfor the little creature's jaws.\r\n\r\nThen the moulting seasons are always periods of trial to the larvae, and\r\noften of loss to the rearer. Some of the hardier species may pass\r\nthrough all their moults without appearing to suffer anything more than\r\na slight inconvenience at each, but in other cases the greater part of a\r\nbrood may fall victims to these ailments of the growing stage.\r\n\r\nApart from these sources of loss, however, larvae are subject to numerous\r\ndiseases, infectious and otherwise, about which we know but little. A\r\nfever may rage in one of our cages; a fungoid growth may establish\r\nitself on the bodies of our pets, or we may see them cut down, one by\r\none, through a fatal attack of diarrh[oe]a.\r\n\r\nIn many such cases we are at a loss as to what to do. Blue pills and\r\nblack draughts are not to be prescribed, and the modern practices of\r\nsurgery and inoculation have not yet been applied to insect patients\r\nwith very great success; but we must do our best to adopt hygienic\r\nprinciples, paying the greatest attention to proper means of ventilation\r\nand to a regular and wholesome dieting. In the case of diarrh[oe]a--a\r\nvery common insect malady--the best we can do is to avoid the young and\r\njuicy leaves of the food plant, and substitute the older, and drier\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nIchneumon flies have already been mentioned as great enemies of larvae.\r\nThese flies either deposit their eggs on the skins of caterpillars, or\r\nthrust their sharp _ovipositors_ into the creature's flesh and lay their\r\neggs beneath the skin. When the young ichneumons are hatched, they\r\nimmediately begin to feed on the fatty matter that is usually stored in\r\ncomparative abundance under the skin of the caterpillar, and thus they\r\ngrow at the expense of their host, within whose body they lie completely\r\nhidden from view.\r\n\r\nThe poor caterpillar, though being eaten alive, often shows no external\r\nsigns of the mischief wrought within, and, even though its substance is\r\nreally decreased by the hungry internal parasites, yet the rapid growth\r\nof these robbers maintains the general plumpness of a healthy larva. But\r\nthe ichneumons, having at last devoured the store of fat, and avoided\r\nthe vital organs of the caterpillar, as if with a view to preserve their\r\nliving home to the latest moment, now commence to attack the latter,\r\nspeedily reducing the vitality of their host to the lowest ebb, and\r\nfinally causing its death.\r\n\r\nThis untimely end may come before the caterpillar is full grown, or the\r\ninsect may change to the pupa before the ichneumons have done their\r\nworst, but it rarely occurs that the unfortunate creature has sufficient\r\nstrength to carry it on to the final stage.\r\n\r\nA large number of the collected larvae will have been 'stung,' much to\r\nthe disgust and disappointment of the rearer; and hence the advantage of\r\nrearing your specimens from ova wherever possible, providing you keep\r\nthem so well under cover that the ichneumons cannot visit your broods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Management of Pupae_\r\n\r\nThe disappointments connected with the rearing of _Lepidoptera_ are by\r\nno means at an end when all have passed successfully into the pupal\r\ncondition, and the number of perfect insects obtained will often fall\r\nfar short of the number of pupae in your boxes; but we must now see what\r\ncan be done to minimise the death rate of the captives.\r\n\r\nOne or more suitable boxes must be prepared for the reception of the\r\npupae, and the following suggestion will answer all purposes:\r\n\r\nGet a wooden box, quite rough and unplaned inside, large enough to\r\naccommodate your pupae with ease, and not less than eight inches deep.\r\nMake several holes in the bottom, or else knock the bottom completely\r\nout, and nail in its place a sheet of perforated zinc. Also make a lid\r\nconsisting of gauze attached to a light wood frame.\r\n\r\nPlace a layer of clean gravel, about an inch deep, in the bottom, and\r\nover this a few inches of sifted soil or cocoa-nut fibre.\r\n\r\nNow take all the pupae that are 'earthed' in your cages, and arrange them\r\non the prepared bed; also add to them the pupae you may have dug out\r\nduring your various excursions. Cover all with a layer of the material\r\nselected for the bed, and then add a layer of moss.\r\n\r\nNext come the pupae that are suspended by silky fibres, or are inclosed\r\nin cocoons. These should be fixed with pins around the sides of the box,\r\nrunning the pins either through the tuft of silk at the 'tail,' or the\r\nouter layer of the cocoon, or through the portion of the dried food\r\nplant to which they are attached.\r\n\r\nHere your pupae will remain till they emerge, and the box may be kept in\r\nany airy place where it is not likely to be forgotten, for it is\r\nessential that the perfect insects should be removed as soon as possible\r\nafter quitting their cases. It does not matter much whether the pupae be\r\nkept in or out of doors, providing they are sheltered from rain and very\r\nsevere frosts; but of course, if the former, the imagines will emerge a\r\nlittle earlier, even if the room in which your specimens are stored has\r\nno fire.\r\n\r\nEven when protected in boxes such as that described the pupae are subject\r\nto enemies and dangers. The soil and moss employed may contain slugs,\r\nmites, or other creatures which prey on insects, and the amount of\r\nmoisture present in these materials and in the atmosphere may prove too\r\nlittle for some species or too much for others.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for the former evil is a simple one. Bake the soil or fibre\r\nwell before fitting up the box, and boil and afterwards dry the moss.\r\nYou may then be sure that all life previously contained is quite\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nBut the degree of humidity is a point not so easily settled, and so\r\nvariable are the experiences and opinions of different entomologists\r\nthat it is difficult to advise a beginner on the subject. The fact that\r\nsome strongly advise a perennial dampness, while others recommend no\r\nattempt at the application of water, would seem to show that there are\r\nprobably important points to be urged on both sides.\r\n\r\nNothing can be better than a very careful observation of pupae in their\r\nnatural conditions. When engaged in pupa digging you will observe that\r\nthe larger number are to be found on the east and north sides of trees\r\nwhere the soil is protected from the heaviest rains; on the other hand a\r\ngood many are certainly found in very moist and sometimes even in wet\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nParticular notice should be taken of such experiences, making every\r\nallowance for the exceptions that prove the rule, and then let the\r\nnatural conditions be maintained in your nurseries at home. To carry\r\nthis out two pupa boxes should be kept, one for those species that seem\r\nto require dry situations, and the other for the species that apparently\r\ndo best with moist surroundings.\r\n\r\nBut when it is desired to maintain the pupae in a moist condition, great\r\ncare must be taken not to allow any accumulation of stagnant water. The\r\nbox we have described, with its bottom of perforated zinc, is well\r\nadapted for this purpose. Let it stand on a couple of strips of wood, so\r\nthat any excess of moisture may readily drain through. The perforated\r\nbottom will also allow of a free circulation of air, thus securing the\r\nventilation that is desirable in all boxes, whether wet or dry.\r\n\r\nIf you have any insects that have pupated within moist stems, they\r\nshould be kept in a moist condition till they emerge. The simplest way\r\nof doing this is to support the stems in a layer of wetted but\r\nwell-drained silver sand.\r\n\r\nForcing may be resorted to when it is required to obtain the imagines\r\nfor early setting in order to get them in the cabinet before the busy\r\nseason begins. The method is simple. Place the pupa box on a shelf in a\r\nroom where a fire is kept every day. By this means you may get all your\r\nspecimens out within a few weeks, even when you start the forcing at the\r\nbeginning or middle of the winter. If, however, you require the imagines\r\nfor breeding, you must be careful that the eggs are not laid long before\r\nthe buds of the necessary food plants are due.\r\n\r\nWhen you are expecting the appearance of perfect insects, the pupa\r\nboxes should be examined every day. A morning visit to your pupae (for\r\nmost insects emerge in the morning) may reward you with the sight of a\r\nnewly emerged imago, clinging to the rough surface of the box, thus\r\naffording you an opportunity of observing the wonderful expansion of the\r\nwings. But the greeting is not always of such a pleasant character, for\r\nyour disappointed eyes will sometimes be cast on a host of horrid\r\nichneumons that have just quitted a shell from which you were expecting\r\na prize of some specially valued species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_SETTING AND PRESERVING_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Setting and Preserving Butterflies and Moths_\r\n\r\nUp to the present we have been dealing only with living forms--learning\r\nhow to catch and rear the Lepidoptera that fall to our lot; but now we\r\nhave to become acquainted with the methods of preparing our dead\r\nspecimens in such a way that they may form a useful collection for\r\nfuture study and reference. Our first attention shall be given to the\r\napparatus necessary for this work.\r\n\r\nThe most important requirement is the setting boards, of which several\r\nare necessary, the sizes varying according to the dimensions of the\r\ndifferent insects to be 'set.' The _lengths_ of all the boards should be\r\nthe same, not only for the convenience of packing when not in use, but\r\nalso in order that they may, if required, be arranged neatly in the\r\n'drying house' to be presently described. The widths only will vary, and\r\nin this respect the boards must be adapted to the measurements of the\r\ninsects from tip to tip when the wings are fully expanded. Thus, a set\r\nof a dozen boards, ten or twelve inches long, and from one to five\r\ninches wide, will do for a good start. Of course you may commence with a\r\nsmaller number than twelve, but if you really mean to do the thing well,\r\nyou will eventually require a good stock of boards.\r\n\r\nHere, again, it may be mentioned that all the necessary requisites may\r\nbe purchased ready for use, a set of boards and a drying house complete\r\ncosting from ten to twenty shillings according to size and quality; but\r\nas the reader, like myself, may prefer to construct his own, I will\r\nsupply him with hints and suggestions sufficient for the work.\r\n\r\nEach board is constructed in this way. Cut out and plane up a piece of\r\nwood of the required length and breadth, and about one-eighth of an inch\r\nthick. Glue on the top of this a layer of cork about half an inch in\r\nthickness, leaving the whole under a moderate pressure until the glue is\r\nquite hard. The sheets of cork for this purpose may be bought at any\r\nnaturalist's stores; but slices cut from good large bottle corks may be\r\nmade to answer equally well if you don't mind the extra time expended in\r\ncutting and fixing.\r\n\r\nWhen the glue has well set, trim off the edges of the cork flush with\r\nthe sides of the wood, and then cut out a groove down the whole length\r\nof the cork, of course in the middle, and of such a size that it will\r\njust contain the bodies of the insects for which it is intended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--SECTION OF A SETTING BOARD.]\r\n\r\nThe satisfactory cutting of this groove is not a very easy matter, but\r\nif its position is first carefully marked, a long rat-tail file may be\r\nmade to plough it out neatly and regularly. As an alternative the\r\nfollowing plan is good. First cover the wood with a layer of cork about\r\na _quarter_ of an inch thick, and then glue on the top of this _two_\r\nnarrower strips, about as thick as the bodies of the insects for which\r\nthe board is intended, leaving a space of the required size between\r\nthem, as shown in fig. 60. In this way you get a groove of square\r\nsection, that is in some respects preferable to the round one cut out by\r\nmeans of the rat-tail file.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--SECTIONS OF SETTING BOARDS.]\r\n\r\nNow comes a question about which there is a difference in the tastes or\r\nfancies of entomologists. Shall the boards be perfectly flat on the top,\r\nor shall the sides slope from the groove, or shall the surface be\r\nrounded? A glance at the three sections of setting boards will show\r\nclearly what is meant. The rounded board is most commonly used, and the\r\ngraceful curve thus given to a butterfly or moth set on such is\r\ncertainly attractive; but it is not natural. The wings of these insects\r\nare rigid, and are never seen bent into such curves in a living\r\nspecimen. For this reason I much prefer a perfectly plane surface on\r\neach side of the groove. Then, as to whether there shall be a slope or\r\nnot, this is a matter of less importance. A very decided sloping of the\r\nwings is certainly not so convenient for future examination; nor does\r\nit, to my mind, look nearly so well as both sides in the same plane, or\r\nat a very gentle inclination. But perhaps this subject had better be\r\nleft to the taste of the reader, remembering, however, that, whatever\r\nplan be adopted, all the boards should be alike in this respect, so that\r\nthere may be a degree of uniformity in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the cork must, in all cases, be nicely smoothed down with\r\nglass paper, and then covered with thin white paper, fixed to its\r\nsurface with ordinary paste.\r\n\r\nWhen insects are on the boards, they should be placed in an airy spot,\r\nas free as possible from dust, while they are drying. Hence the\r\nadvisability of some form of 'drying house.' This is simply a box,\r\nstanding on end, and provided with a hinged door consisting of a sheet\r\nof perforated zinc in a wooden frame. The boards may slide in this on\r\nlittle slips of wood nailed or glued on to the sides, or the wooden\r\nbases of the boards may project beyond the cork at the ends, and slide\r\ninto grooves in the side of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--A BUTTERFLY ON THE SETTING BOARD.]\r\n\r\nBeyond these requirements nothing is wanted save a good stock of pins,\r\nthin card or ordinary writing paper, and a 'setting needle.' The\r\nlast-named item is simply a needle mounted in a handle, and a good one\r\nmay be made by thrusting the head of a darning needle into a piece of\r\ntwig. The pins used for setting--that is, for fixing the pieces of paper\r\nor card to keep the parts in position--may be of the ordinary kind; but\r\nentomological pins are far preferable, even for this purpose; for, being\r\nmuch thinner, they do not damage and disfigure the setting boards so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nNow as to the setting. First see that the pin with which you are to fix\r\nyour dead insect passes centrally through the thorax. Then fix it firmly\r\non the setting board, its body lying neatly in the groove of the cork.\r\nCut out some little pointed strips of card or paper, and, after bringing\r\nthe wings into position with the setting needle, fix each one by a\r\npinned strip. In spreading out the wings, care must be taken not to\r\npierce them at all, but simply to push them into their place by pressing\r\nthe needle at their bases, or by putting the needle beneath and\r\n_lifting_ them out.\r\n\r\nInstead of pointed pieces of card, uniform strips of paper may be used,\r\nas shown in fig. 63, each strip passing over both wings.\r\n\r\nAfter the four wings have been properly arranged, a few extra pins may\r\nbe used to keep other parts in position. Thus, the antennae may be placed\r\nat equal angles, the proboscis may be extended, and a couple of pins may\r\nbe used to support the abdomen if it is inclined to bend downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--ANOTHER METHOD OF SETTING BUTTERFLIES AND\r\nMOTHS.]\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, insects should be set soon after they are dead,\r\nwhile the parts are still soft and supple. But where this cannot be\r\ndone, and the specimens have become stiff, brittle, and rigid, they must\r\nbe 'relaxed' before any attempt is made at setting them out.\r\n\r\nThis process of relaxing consists in placing the specimens in a very\r\nmoist atmosphere for a few days. There are several simple ways of doing\r\nthis, many of which will readily suggest themselves to the reader. Your\r\ncollecting box, if a zinc one, may also be used as a relaxer. Pin your\r\nstiff insects in it, after well moistening the cork, and simply shut\r\nthem up for a day or two. Any metal box will serve the same purpose\r\nproviding you put into it a piece of sheet cork on which to fix the\r\ninsects, and this cork may rest on a bed of moist sand.\r\n\r\nAnother plan is to float the pinned specimens on corks in a shallow\r\nvessel of water, and cover them over with a bell glass.\r\n\r\nInsects that are being relaxed should be examined from time to time, and\r\nthe degree of flexibility acquired tested by a gentle pressure of the\r\nsetting needle or by blowing on them. If not sufficiently supple, give\r\nanother day in the damp cell, but never allow them to be forgotten till\r\nthey are covered with mildew.\r\n\r\nThe time occupied in thoroughly drying butterflies and moths will vary\r\nconsiderably according to their sizes and the condition of the\r\natmosphere. In hot and dry summer weather four or five days will prove\r\nquite sufficient for the _very_ small and thin-bodied species. From one\r\nto two weeks, however, may be looked upon as the average period; but the\r\nlarge and thick-bodied moths may require more than this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best test of their condition is the gentle pressing of the\r\nsetting needle against the abdomen--the last part of the body to become\r\ndry and stiff. If the abdomen seems quite firm and rigid, you are pretty\r\nsafe in removing the specimen from the board; but if it bends at all\r\nunder a slight pressure of the needle let it remain for a day or two\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nIf your cabinet is quite ready for the reception of new-comers, the\r\ninsects may be put in their proper places immediately after their\r\nremoval from the setting boards; but if not, they may be pinned\r\ntemporarily in a 'store box' till the time comes when you have proper\r\naccommodation provided. The full consideration of these matters will be\r\ndealt with in another chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the setting of some of your specimens will not\r\nexactly please you. If such is the case, put them in a relaxing box for\r\na day or two, and then reset them more to your fancy.\r\n\r\nWe have now to deal with a matter that applies more particularly to\r\nmoths, especially the very large and thick-bodied species. The abdomens\r\nof these become more or less contracted and shrivelled on drying,\r\nsometimes to such an extent as to look most unsightly.\r\n\r\nThere is a remedy for this, and the time and patience required in\r\nworking it out will be well repaid by the superior results obtained.\r\n\r\nWhile the abdomen is still in a soft condition, make a slit throughout\r\nits length with a very sharp knife or a sharp-pointed pair of scissors.\r\nThis slit should be made down the centre of the under surface, or, if\r\nthe insect is to be placed in the cabinet with the under side exposed,\r\ndown the middle line of the back. Then remove all the contents of the\r\nabdomen, scraping them out with a piece of hooked wire, or removing them\r\nwith a fine pair of forceps, and leaving the skin as clean as possible\r\nboth within and without. Now introduce a packing of cotton wool, just\r\nsufficient in quantity to maintain the natural form of the body as the\r\nspecimen dries.\r\n\r\nThere is another good method of stuffing moths that possesses a decided\r\nadvantage over the one just described, since it leaves the specimen in\r\nsuch a perfect condition that it shows no appearance of having been\r\nstuffed when viewed from either side. This consists in snipping off the\r\nabdomen at the waist, clearing out the contents with a hooked wire,\r\nlightly stuffing it with cotton wool pushed in at the waist, and then\r\nsetting it aside to dry, while the other part of the insect is\r\nundergoing the same process on the setting board. When both parts of the\r\nmoth are thoroughly dry, the stuffed abdomen is easily fixed in its\r\nplace with a little coaguline; and this, if neatly done, will not show\r\nthe slightest sign of the treatment to which the insect has been\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nEven after your insects are finally housed in the cabinet, they are\r\nsubject to two other dangers, both of which are more destructive to\r\nmoths than to butterflies. One is technically known as 'grease,' and the\r\nother is the invasion of certain museum pests that feed on the\r\nspecimens, causing them to fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nExamine the moths that have been for a time in the cabinet, and some are\r\nsure to exhibit an oily or greasy appearance, the hairs of the abdomen,\r\nand perhaps also of the thorax, being clogged together just as if the\r\nspecimen had been dipped in oil, the same miserable condition perhaps\r\nbeing shared also by parts of the wings.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the gradual oozing out of the fatty matter that is always\r\npresent to a greater or less extent in the bodies of the insects, and\r\nwhich must necessarily show itself more sparingly in specimens that have\r\nbeen carefully stuffed.\r\n\r\nThe old saying, 'Prevention is better than cure,' applies well in the\r\npresent case; but as there are times when a knowledge of the 'cure' is\r\nthe only means of saving a valuable specimen from destruction, we will\r\nstudy both.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the two in the order of the well-worn proverb, we will\r\nconsider the prevention first. Always carefully clean out and stuff the\r\nabdomens of large-bodied insects; and as a rule, treat them with some\r\nsubstance that will either absorb or dissolve out all oily matter. I\r\nthink the best plan is to remove the abdomen, clean it out if its size\r\npermits of such an operation, and then, after labelling it to prevent\r\nits future application to the wrong body, either let it remain in a\r\nbottle of magnesia for several weeks, or soak it in benzole or ether for\r\na few hours or longer.\r\n\r\nIf magnesia has been employed as an absorbent, you have simply to blow\r\nor lightly brush off the loose powder that clings to the body, and then\r\nfix it in its place with coaguline. A body dipped in ether or benzole\r\nwill look as if completely spoilt at first, for the furry coat that\r\nclothes it will lie matted and almost entirely robbed of its beautiful\r\ncolours, reminding one forcibly of the proverbial 'drowned rat.' But\r\ntake no notice of this change. Let the body have at least a few hours in\r\nthe liquid, extending the time to a day or two in the case of very large\r\nones and those which experience has proved to be particularly liable to\r\n'grease;' and, immediately on withdrawing it, fix it with a pin in a\r\ngood strong draught, such as you may obtain by opening a window about an\r\ninch, or, if a breezy day, in the open air.\r\n\r\nThese liquids are so volatile (and for that reason should never be left\r\nexposed in an open vessel) that they rapidly evaporate, leaving the dry\r\nhair to be loosened by the breeze, thus bringing back the natural\r\nappearance almost perfectly.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many of the smaller insects that were not considered\r\nto require the stuffing or grease-removing operations will sooner or\r\nlater exhibit a greasy tendency in the cabinet. At first the abdomen is\r\naffected, and the oily matter then gradually creeps over the rest of the\r\nbody, finally spreading over the wings, and giving the insect a most\r\ndeplorable aspect. But these are not irreparably lost, and the following\r\ncure will often bring them back to their former beauty.\r\n\r\nIf the abdomen only shows signs of grease, cut it off and soak it in one\r\nof the above-named liquids for a day or so, replacing it as above after\r\nthe drying operation. If, however, the oily matter has spread to the\r\nthorax and the bases of the wings, the whole specimen must be soaked,\r\nusing a basin or jar of suitable size, covered with a plate of glass. A\r\ngood draught during the drying operation will do much to prevent the\r\nhair from sticking in matted tufts close against the surface of the body\r\nand wings, and a gentle brushing with a very soft camel-hair brush will\r\nloosen and reset the fur.\r\n\r\nThe other danger to which we have referred is the invasion of certain\r\n'mites' and other museum pests that pay periodical visits to our cabinet\r\ndrawers and store boxes, often committing such havoc as to severely try\r\nthe patience of an interested naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe way to prevent such intrusions is to make the atmosphere of the\r\ncompartments so obnoxious (to them) that they dare not enter; and,\r\nfurther, to so spice up your specimens that they are no longer safely\r\nedible to the invaders.\r\n\r\nThe first object can be attained by always keeping camphor or\r\nnaphthaline (albo-carbon) in each division. A lump of either substance\r\nmay be secured by pins or a little perforated cell in the corner of each\r\ndrawer or box, or the bottom of each may be dusted with finely powdered\r\nnaphthaline; but as both these solids are volatile, care must be taken\r\nto renew the supply as occasion requires.\r\n\r\nThen, with regard to the second precaution, perhaps nothing is more\r\neffectual than corrosive sublimate. A little of this may be dissolved in\r\na small bottle of alcohol (spirits of wine), labelled with the name and\r\nthe word POISON, and kept ready for use. All the skins of stuffed\r\nspecimens should be painted with this solution, and the stuffing itself\r\nmay be moistened with it before insertion.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another circumstance that renders a watchful care of your\r\ncabinet specimens necessary, if you happen to possess many that were\r\ncaptured 'at sugar.' Some of these will have so gorged themselves with\r\nsyrup that they are literally full of it, and this will sometimes find\r\nits way to the outside, often dropping on the surface beneath. In such\r\ncases the sugar should be removed as completely as possible, and the\r\nbodies stuffed, before they are quite dry; but if the specimens have\r\nbeen in the cabinet so long that they are stiff and hard, the under\r\nsides of the abdomens may be completely cut out with a very sharp knife\r\nand thrown away, and then the sugar cleaned out from the upper shell as\r\nneatly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_PRESERVING OVA, LARVAE AND PUPAE_\r\n\r\n\r\nMany young entomologists give their attention almost solely to the\r\nperfect forms of insects, often collecting and studying a very large\r\nnumber of species without regard to their earlier stages and\r\nmetamorphoses. This is decidedly a very great mistake. Although the\r\nlifeless form pinned in a cabinet may be a most beautiful object in\r\nitself, yet a study of this alone is uninteresting compared with that of\r\nthe wonderful changes it has undergone since the time it was a very\r\nyoung larva.\r\n\r\nThe different stages of the insects should be known as far as possible,\r\nand these, as well as the perfect forms, should be included in the\r\ncollection for future study and reference. A good cabinet, according to\r\nmy own opinion, is one that possesses, among other good features, a\r\nnumber of complete sets illustrative of the life history of at least the\r\nmore typical forms; and as it is not a difficult matter to preserve the\r\nearlier stages, there is really no excuse for their omission from the\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe empty shells of ova are in themselves sometimes interesting objects,\r\nespecially when they illustrate some peculiar instinct on the part of\r\nthe parent. Sterile eggs, also, often fall into the hands of breeders\r\nand rearers, and these, though in other respects unprofitable, are\r\nuseful in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIf fertile eggs are to be prepared for a collection, they must be\r\nkilled. This is easily done by thrusting into each one the point of a\r\nvery fine needle, or by immersing them for a moment in boiling water, or\r\nby shutting them up in a bottle with camphor. In drying they often\r\ncontract more or less, and frequently change their colour; still these\r\nare useful, providing notes have been taken of the characters thus lost.\r\nThe larger eggs are capable of special treatment where the owner has the\r\nnecessary time and patience, and where the highest results are desired.\r\nBy means of a surgeon's injector of small size the contents of the eggs\r\ncan be removed; and then, by the same instrument, a warm solution of\r\ngelatine, coloured in such a way as to restore the natural tint, may be\r\nforced into the empty shell. As the gelatine cools and hardens, it\r\nprevents any shrinking of the shell, and thus both form and colour are\r\nwell preserved.\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of larvae you will require one or two simple\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is a suitable glass blowpipe, one form of which is\r\nhere illustrated. It consists of a glass tube, one end of which has been\r\ndrawn out very fine; a piece of watch spring tied to it in such a manner\r\nthat it will hold the skin of a larva at the small end, and a piece of\r\nindia-rubber tubing at the other end, pressed by means of a brass spring\r\nclip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--A BLOWPIPE FOR LARVAE.]\r\n\r\nA little drying oven is also very useful, but not absolutely necessary.\r\nIf you decide to have one, any square box of sheet iron (not soldered\r\ntinned iron) may be readily converted into one. It must be provided with\r\na hinged door in the front with a ventilator at the bottom, a hole for\r\nthe escape of hot air at the top, and a tripod wire stand inside on\r\nwhich to rest the specimens while drying. The whole should be supported\r\non a wire stand, so that heat may be applied below.\r\n\r\nEach larva to be preserved should be dealt with in this way. First kill\r\nit by means of any one of the killing bottles or boxes already\r\ndescribed, or by immersion in spirit of wine. When quite dead, enlarge\r\nthe anal orifice by thrusting a needle into it, and then lay it on a\r\npiece of blotting paper with its head toward you. Now take a round\r\nruler, previously covered with blotting paper, and roll the larva gently\r\nfrom head to tail till all the contents of the skin have been expelled.\r\nNext fix the skin on the fine end of the blowpipe, by thrusting the\r\npoint of the latter into the opening, and allowing the spring to press\r\ngently on its edge. Gently blow into the skin till it is inflated just\r\nto a _little below_ natural size, then either hold it near a fire or\r\nrest it in the drying oven till it is quite dry and rigid.\r\n\r\nIf you have done your work neatly, the skin and blowpipe will both be\r\nquite air-tight when the clip is closed; and the air, finding no outlet,\r\nwill still further inflate the skin when it expands on exposure to heat.\r\nThis is the reason why you are directed to blow it out to something\r\nshort of the natural dimensions. If you find that this expansion causes\r\nthe skin to stretch beyond its normal size, a little of the air must be\r\nallowed to escape while it is yet soft and flexible.\r\n\r\nThe front of the larva is generally the last portion to become dry, and\r\nwhen this is quite rigid the skin may be removed from the blowpipe. This\r\nis a matter that requires the greatest care; for the skin is so very\r\nthin and brittle that a little rough handling will break it to pieces.\r\nAs a rule it may be easily pushed off the pipe by a slight pressure\r\nbehind, or a gentle twisting motion will loosen its hold; but this\r\nlatter method can hardly be applied to hairy larvae without breaking off\r\nthe hairs, now rendered very brittle by the heat.\r\n\r\nIf you find the slightest difficulty in detaching the skin of a valuable\r\nspecimen, it is far better to damage the blowpipe than to risk spoiling\r\nthe skin. Supposing your blowpipe is a glass one, you can easily break\r\noff the end of it after making a cut with a very small triangular file,\r\nand the portion thus removed may be left attached to the skin. Then,\r\nafter softening the glass blowpipe in a gas flame or the flame of a\r\nspirit lamp, it can be drawn out thin again for future work. Those who\r\ncan manipulate glass tubing in this way will find it far better to lay\r\nin a stock of suitable material, drawing it out when required, than to\r\npurchase blowpipes ready made at the naturalist's shop.\r\n\r\nVery fine hollow stems, such as those of the bamboo cane, may be used\r\ninstead of glass; and these possess the advantage of being easily cut\r\nwith a sharp knife when there is any difficulty in removing the skin.\r\nAgain, whether glass or fine stems are used, a little grease of any kind\r\nplaced previously on the end will allow the dried skin to be slid off\r\nwith less difficulty.\r\n\r\nPreserved larvae should preferably be mounted on small twigs or\r\nartificial imitations of the leaves of the proper food plants. A little\r\ncoaguline applied to the claspers will fix them very firmly on these\r\ntwigs or leaves, which are then secured in the cabinet by means of one\r\nor two small pins.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the natural colours of many caterpillars\r\ncannot be preserved in the blown skins. Some are rendered much lighter\r\nin colour on account of the withdrawal of the contents, while others\r\nturn dark during the drying. In the smooth-skinned species the natural\r\ntints may be restored by painting or by staining with suitable aniline\r\ndyes, but these artificial imitations of the natural colours are always\r\nfar less beautiful than the hues of the living larvae.\r\n\r\nVery few words need be said on the preservation of pupae. Many of them do\r\nnot alter much in form and colour, and therefore they require no special\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nIf a pupa has to be killed for the purpose of adding to the value of the\r\ncollection, simply plunge it into boiling water, and it is ready to be\r\nfixed in the cabinet as soon as it is quite dry.\r\n\r\nThe empty pupa cases, too, from which the perfect insects have emerged,\r\nare often worth preserving, especially if the damage done by the imago\r\non forcing its way out is repaired with the aid of a little coaguline.\r\n\r\nLet all larvae and pupae be preserved in their characteristic attitudes\r\nand positions as far as possible, so that each one tells some\r\ninteresting feature of the life history of the living being it\r\nrepresents. Further, enrich your collection by numerous specimens of the\r\nvarious kinds of cocoons constructed by the larvae, pinning each one\r\nbeside its proper species; and never refuse a place to any object that\r\nrelates something of the life history of the creatures you are\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_THE CABINET_--_ARRANGEMENT OF SPECIMENS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selection of a cabinet or other storehouse for the rapidly\r\nincreasing specimens of insect forms is often a matter of no small\r\ndifficulty to a youthful entomologist. Indeed, there are very many\r\npoints of considerable importance to be considered before any final\r\ndecision is made. Freedom from dust, the exclusion of pests, the\r\nconvenience of the collector, the depth of his pocket, and the general\r\nappearance of the storehouse must be considered, and it is impossible,\r\ntherefore, to describe a form that is equally suitable to all.\r\n\r\nIf it is absolutely necessary that the cabinet (or its substitute) be of\r\na very inexpensive character, and if, at the same time, the collector\r\nhas not the mechanical skill necessary for its construction, then\r\nperhaps the best thing he can do is to procure a number of shallow\r\n(about an inch and a half deep) cardboard, glass-topped boxes, such as\r\nare to be obtained at drapers' shops. For the sake of uniformity and\r\nconvenience in packing, have them all of one size. Glue in small slices\r\nof cork just where the insects are to be pinned, and see that each box\r\nis supplied with either camphor or naphthaline. All the boxes may be\r\npacked in a cupboard or in a case made specially to contain them; and a\r\nlabel on the front of each will enable you to select any one when\r\nrequired without disturbing the others.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that glass is not necessary, though it is\r\ncertainly convenient at times, especially when you are exhibiting your\r\nspecimens to admiring non-entomological friends, who have almost always\r\na most alarming way of bringing the tip of the first finger dangerously\r\nnear as they are pointing out their favourite colours. 'Isn't _that_ one\r\na beauty?' is a common remark, and therewith off snaps a wing of one of\r\nyour choicest insects. When glass is used, however, see that the\r\nspecimens are excluded from light, or the colours will soon lose their\r\nnatural brilliancy.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has a set of carpenter's tools and the ability to use them\r\nwell will be able to construct for himself either a set of store boxes\r\nor a cabinet of many drawers in which to keep his natural treasures. In\r\nthis case a few considerations are necessary before deciding on the form\r\nwhich the storehouse is to take.\r\n\r\nA cabinet, if nicely made, forms a very sightly article of furniture;\r\nand, if space can be found for it, is the best and most convenient\r\nreceptacle. One of about twelve to twenty drawers will be quite\r\nsufficient for a time; and the few following hints and suggestions may\r\nbe useful.\r\n\r\nThe wood used should be well seasoned, and free from resin. The drawers\r\nshould fit well, and slide without the least danger of shaking. Each one\r\nshould be lined with sheet cork, about one-eighth of an inch thick,\r\nglued to the bottom, nicely levelled with sand paper, and then covered\r\nwith thin, pure white paper, laid on with thin paste. It is also\r\nadvisable to cover each with glass, inclosed in a light wood frame that\r\nfits so closely as to prevent the intrusion of mites.\r\n\r\nThe drawers may be arranged in a single vertical tier if the cabinet is\r\nto stand on the floor, or in two tiers if it is to be shorter for\r\nplacing on the top of another piece of furniture; and glass doors,\r\nfastened by a lock and key, may be made to cover the front if such are\r\ndesired as a matter of fancy, or as a precaution against the meddlesome\r\nhabits of juvenile fingers.\r\n\r\nStore boxes are sometimes chosen in preference to cabinets because they\r\nare more portable, and because they can be arranged on shelves--an\r\nimportant consideration when floor space is not available.\r\n\r\nThese boxes should be cork-lined and glazed like the cabinet drawers;\r\nand if they are made in two equal portions, lined with cork on both\r\nsides, and closing up like a book, they may be arranged on shelves like\r\nbooks, in which position they will collect but little dust.\r\n\r\nBoth store boxes and cabinets are always kept in stock by the dealers,\r\nthe former ranging from a few shillings each, and the latter from\r\nfifteen shillings to a guinea per drawer. Knowing this, you can decide\r\nfor yourself between the two alternatives--making and purchasing.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the manner in which our specimens should be\r\narranged and labelled.\r\n\r\nThe table forming Appendix I contains the names of _all_ the British\r\nbutterflies and larger moths, and shows their division into _Sections_,\r\n_Tribes_, _Families_, and _Genera_. This table is the result of most\r\ncareful study on the part of leading entomologists, and shows how, in\r\ntheir opinion, the insects can best be arranged to show their relation\r\nto one another; and you cannot do better than adopt the same order in\r\nyour collection.\r\n\r\n  RHOPALOCERA\r\n  PAPILIONIDAE                   _Euchlo[:e]_                 NYMPHALIDAE\r\n   _Papilio_         O              O              O          _Argynnis_\r\n      O              O              O              O              O\r\n      O              O              O              O              O\r\n      O              O              O              O              O\r\n   Machaon          Rapae        Cardamines       Edusa            O\r\n                                                                Selene\r\n   PIERIDAE          O         _Leucophasia_       O\r\n   _Aporia_          O              O              O              O\r\n      O              O              O           v.

These, when cut up, supply you with neat labels for your\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to study the British _Lepidoptera_ as completely as\r\npossible, you may as well start at once with a sufficiently extensive\r\ncabinet, and arrange all the labels of your list before you introduce\r\nthe insects. You will thus have a place provided ready for each specimen\r\nas you acquire it, and the introduction of species obtained later on\r\nwill not compel you to be continually moving and rearranging the\r\ndrawers.\r\n\r\nProbably the number of blank spaces will at first suggest an almost\r\nhopeless task, but a few years of careful searching and rearing will\r\ngive you heart to continue your interesting work.\r\n\r\nArrange all the insects in perpendicular rows. Put the names of each\r\nsection, tribe, family, and genus _at the head_ of their respective\r\ndivisions, and the names of the species below each insect or series of\r\ninsects. The opposite plan, in which the circles represent the insects\r\nthemselves, will make this clear.\r\n\r\nThree or four specimens of each species are generally sufficient, except\r\nwhere variations in colouring are to be exhibited. Wherever differences\r\nexist in the form or markings of the sexes, both should appear; and one\r\nspecimen of each species should be pinned so as to exhibit the under\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFinally, each drawer or box should have a neat label _outside_ giving\r\nthe name or names of the divisions of insects that are represented\r\nwithin. This will enable you to find anything you may require without\r\nthe necessity of opening drawer after drawer or box after box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nBRITISH BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now treated in detail of the changes through which butterflies\r\nand moths have to pass, and have studied the methods by which we may\r\nobtain and preserve the insects in their different stages. I shall now\r\ngive such a brief description of individual species as will enable the\r\nreader to recognise them readily. We will begin with the butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_THE SWALLOW-TAIL AND THE 'WHITES'_\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--PAPILIONIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Swallow-tail_ (_Papilio Machaon_)\r\n\r\nOur first family (_Papilionidae_) contains only one British species--the\r\nbeautiful Swallow-tail (_Papilio Machaon_), distinguished at once from\r\nall other British butterflies by its superior size and the 'tails'\r\nprojecting from the hind margin of the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful insect is figured on Plate I, where its bold black\r\nmarkings on a yellow ground are so conspicuous as to render a written\r\ndescription superfluous. Attention may be called, however, to the yellow\r\nscales that dot the dark bands and blotches, making them look as if they\r\nhad been powdered; also to the blue clouds that relieve the black bands\r\nof the hind wings, and the round reddish orange spot at the anal angle\r\nof each of the same wings.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this butterfly was once widely distributed throughout\r\nEngland, having been recorded as common in various counties, and has\r\nalso been taken in Scotland and Ireland; but it is now almost\r\nexclusively confined to the fens of Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire,\r\nand Norfolk. Occasionally we hear of the capture of single specimens\r\nquite outside these localities, sometimes even in most unlikely spots,\r\nwhere its food plant does not abound. But we know that _Machaon_ is a\r\ngeneral favourite with entomologists, and that it is sent in the pupal\r\nstate, by post, to all parts of the kingdom; so that the occasional\r\ncapture of the insect far beyond the borders of its haunts is probably\r\nthe outcome of an escape from prison, or of the tender-heartedness of\r\nsome lover of nature who could not bear to see such a beautiful creature\r\ndeprived of its short but joyous, sunny flight.\r\n\r\nYou cannot hope to see this splendid butterfly on the wing unless you\r\nvisit its haunts during its season--May to August; but the pupae may be\r\npurchased for a few pence each from most of the entomological dealers;\r\nand if you obtain a few of these and watch them closely, you may be\r\nfortunate enough to see the perfect insect emerge from its case, and\r\nwitness the gradual expansion of its beautiful wings.\r\n\r\nThe pupa (Plate VIII, fig. 7) itself is a most beautiful object. Its\r\ncolour is a pale green, and it is fixed to its support by the tail, and\r\nfurther secured by a very strong silk band.\r\n\r\nThe larva (Plate VIII, fig. 1), too, is exceedingly beautiful. Its\r\nground colour is a lovely green, and twelve velvety black rings mark the\r\ndivisions between the segments. Between these are also black bars, all\r\nspotted with bright orange except the one on the second segment.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of this larva is the possession of a forked,\r\nY-shaped 'horn,' that is projected from the back, just behind the head,\r\nwhen the creature is alarmed. If it is gently pressed or irritated in\r\nany way, this horn is thrust out just as if it were an important weapon\r\nof defence. And perhaps it is, for it is the source of a powerful odour\r\nof fennel--one of the food plants of the caterpillar--that may possibly\r\nprove objectionable to some of its numerous enemies.\r\n\r\nThe food plants of _Machaon_ are the milk parsley or hog's fennel\r\n(_Peucedanum palustre_), cow-parsnip (_Heracleum sphondylium_), and the\r\nwild angelica (_Angelica sylvestris_); but in confinement it will also\r\npartake of rue and carrot leaves.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species may be found in the fens during the\r\ngreater part of the summer. It turns to a chrysalis in the autumn, and\r\nremains in this state throughout the winter, attached to the stems of\r\nreeds in the vicinity of its food plants. The perfect insect is first\r\nseen in May, and is more or less abundant from this time to the month of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--PIERIDAE\r\n\r\nThis family, though known commonly as the 'Whites,' contains four\r\nBritish species that display beautiful tints of bright yellow or orange.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the _Pieridae_ resemble the last species. Thus the\r\nperfect insects have six fully developed legs; the caterpillars are\r\ndevoid of bristles or spines; and the chrysalides are attached by means\r\nof silky webs at the 'tails,' and strong cords of the same material\r\nround the middle.\r\n\r\nAll the larvae are also cylindrical or wormlike in shape; and their skins\r\nare either quite smooth, or are covered with very short and fine hairs,\r\nthat sometimes impart a soft, velvety appearance.\r\n\r\nThe members of this family are remarkable for their partiality for\r\ncertain of our cultivated plants and trees; and are, in some cases, so\r\nabundant and so voracious, that they are exceedingly destructive to\r\ncertain crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Black-veined White_ (_Aporia Crataegi_)\r\n\r\nThis butterfly may now be regarded as one of our rarities. At one time\r\nit was rather abundant in certain localities in England, among which may\r\nbe mentioned the neighbourhoods of Cardiff and Stroud, also parts of\r\nKent, Sussex, Hampshire, Huntingdonshire, and the Isle of Thanet; but it\r\nis to be feared that this species is nearly or quite extinct in this\r\ncountry. It is well, however, not to give up the search for it, and if\r\nyou happen to be in one of its favoured localities of former days, you\r\nmight net all the doubtful 'Whites' of large size that arouse your\r\nsuspicions, liberating them again if, on inspection, they do not answer\r\nto the description of the species 'wanted.' This course becomes\r\nabsolutely necessary, since the Black-veined White is hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from the Common Large White while on the wing.\r\n\r\nIf you examine a number of British butterflies you will observe that in\r\nnearly all species the wings are bordered by a fringe of hair, more or\r\nless distinct. But the case is different with _Crataegi_. Here they are\r\nbordered by a black nervure, without any trace of fringe, thus giving an\r\namount of rigidity to the edges (see Plate I, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe wing rays, or nervures, are very distinct--a feature that gave rise\r\nto the popular name of the butterfly. In the male they are quite or\r\nnearly black, but those of the fore wings of the female are decidedly\r\nbrown in colour. At the terminations of the wing rays there are\r\ntriangular patches of dark scales, the bases of which unite on the outer\r\nmargins of the wings.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar feature of this insect is the scanty distribution of\r\nscales on the wings. This is particularly so in the case of the female,\r\nwhose wings are semi-transparent in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly is on the wing during June and July, at which time its\r\neggs are laid on the hawthorn (_Crataegus Oxyacantha_) or on fruit\r\ntrees--apple, pear and plum.\r\n\r\nA vigorous search of these trees in the proper localities _may_ reveal\r\nto you a nest of the gregarious larvae, all resting under the cover of a\r\ncommon web of silk. These remain thus under their silken tent throughout\r\nthe hottest hours of the day, and venture out to feed only during the\r\nearly morning and in the evening.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves begin to fall in the autumn, they construct a more\r\nsubstantial web to protect themselves from the dangers of the winter,\r\nand in this they hybernate till the buds burst in the following spring.\r\nThey now venture out, at first during the mildest days only, and feed\r\nvoraciously on the young leaves, returning to their homes to rest. Soon,\r\nhowever, they gradually lose their social tendencies, till at last, when\r\nabout half or three-quarters fed, they become quite solitary in their\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nIn May they are fully grown, and change to the chrysalis state on the\r\ntwigs of their food trees.\r\n\r\nThe larva is black above, with two reddish stripes. The sides and under\r\nsurface are grey, the former being relieved by black spiracles.\r\n\r\nThe pupa (page 45) is greenish or yellowish white, striped with bright\r\nyellow, and spotted with black.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the reader will never meet with this insect in any\r\nof its stages. But, though it may have left us, it is still very\r\nabundant on the Continent, where it does great damage to fruit trees;\r\nand the foreign pupae may be purchased of English dealers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large White_ (_Pieris Brassicae_)\r\n\r\nWe pass now from one of the rarest to one of the most abundant of\r\nBritish butterflies. Everybody has seen the 'Large White,' though we\r\ndoubt whether everybody knows that this insect is not of the same\r\nspecies as the two other very common 'Whites.' The three--Large, Small,\r\nand Green-veined--are so much alike in general colour and markings, and\r\nso similar in their habits and in the selection of their food plants,\r\nthat the non-entomological, not knowing that insects do not grow in\r\ntheir perfect state, may perhaps regard the larger and the smaller as\r\nolder and younger members of the same species. But no--they are three\r\ndistinct species, exhibiting to a careful observer many important marks\r\nby which each may be known from the other two.\r\n\r\nOn Plate I (fig. 3) will be seen a picture of the female _Brassicae_, in\r\nwhich the following markings are depicted: On each fore wing--a blotch\r\nat the tip, a round spot near the centre, another round one nearer the\r\ninner margin, and a tapering spot on the inner margin with its point\r\ntoward the base of the wing. On the hind wings there is only one spot,\r\nsituated near the middle of the costal margin.\r\n\r\nThe male may be readily distinguished by the absence of the black\r\nmarkings on the fore wings, with the exception of those at the tips. He\r\nis also a trifle smaller than his mate.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is double-brooded. The first brood appears in April and\r\nMay, the second in July and August; and the former--the spring\r\nbrood--which emerges from the chrysalides that have hybernated during\r\nthe winter, have _grey_ rather than black tips to the front wings.\r\n\r\nThe ova of _Brassicae_ may be found on the leaves of cabbages in every\r\nkitchen garden, also on the nasturtium, during May and July. They are\r\npretty objects (see fig. 10), something like little bottles or\r\nsculptured vases standing on end, and are arranged either singly or in\r\nlittle groups.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the young larvae are out--from ten to fifteen days after the\r\neggs are deposited--having devoured their shells, they start feeding on\r\nthe selfsame spot, and afterwards wander about, dealing out destruction\r\nas they go, till little remains of their food plant save the mere stumps\r\nand skeletons of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of the caterpillar is bluish green. It has a narrow\r\nyellow stripe down the middle of the back, and two similar but wider\r\nstripes along the sides; and the surface of the body is rendered\r\nsomewhat rough by a number of small black warty projections, from each\r\nof which arises a short hair.\r\n\r\nWhen fully grown, it creeps to some neighbouring wall or fence, up which\r\nit climbs till it reaches a sheltering ledge. Here it constructs its\r\nweb and silken cord as already described (page 36), and then changes to\r\na bluish-white chrysalis, dotted with black. The butterflies of the\r\nsummer brood emerge shortly after, but the chrysalides of the next brood\r\nhybernate till the following spring.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that we are so plagued with 'Whites' seeing that they\r\nhave so many enemies. Many of the insect-feeding birds commit fearful\r\nhavoc among their larvae, and often chase the perfect insects on the\r\nwing, but perhaps their greatest enemy is the ichneumon fly.\r\n\r\nLook under the ledges of a wall of any kitchen garden, and you will see\r\nlittle clusters of oval bodies of a bright yellow colour. Most gardeners\r\nknow that these are in some way or other connected with the caterpillars\r\nthat do so much damage to their vegetables. They are often considered to\r\nbe eggs laid by the larvae, and are consequently killed out of pure\r\nrevenge, or with a desire to save the crops from the future marauders.\r\n\r\nNo greater mistake could be made. These yellow bodies are the silken\r\ncocoons of the caterpillar's own foes. They contain the pupae of the\r\nlittle flies whose larvae have lived within the body of an unfortunate\r\ngrub, and, having flourished to perfection at the expense of their host,\r\nleft its almost empty and nearly lifeless carcase to die and drop to the\r\nground just at the time when it ought to be working out its final\r\nchanges. Often you may see the dying grub beside the cluster of cocoons\r\njust constructed by its deadly enemies. Should you wish to test the\r\nextent of the destructive work of these busy flies, go into your garden\r\nand collect a number of larvae, and endeavour to rear them under cover.\r\nThe probability is that only a small proportion will ever reach the\r\nfinal state, the others having been fatally 'stung' before you took\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small White_ (_P. Rapae_)\r\n\r\nThis butterfly closely resembles the last species except in point of\r\nsize. The male, represented on Plate I (fig. 4), has a dark grey blotch\r\nat the tip of each fore wing, a round spot of the same colour beyond the\r\ncentre of that wing, and another on the costal margin of the hind wing.\r\nThe female may be distinguished by an additional spot near the anal\r\nangle of the fore wing.\r\n\r\nAlthough this and the two other common butterflies (_Brassicae_ and\r\n_Napi_) that frequent our kitchen gardens are usually spoken of as\r\n'Whites,' a glance at a few specimens will show that they are not really\r\nwhite at all, but exhibit delicate shades of cream and yellow, inclining\r\nsometimes to buff. The under surfaces are particularly noticeable in\r\nthis respect, for here the hind wings and the tips of the fore wings\r\ndisplay a very rich yellow.\r\n\r\nThe species we are now considering is also very variable both in its\r\nground colour and the markings of the wings. The former is in some cases\r\na really brilliant yellow; and the latter are in some cases entirely\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n_Rapae_ is double-brooded, the first brood appearing in April and May,\r\nand the other in July and August.\r\n\r\nDuring these months the eggs may be seen in plenty on its numerous food\r\nplants, which include the cabbages and horse-radish of our gardens, also\r\nwater-cress (_Nasturtium officinale_), rape (_Brassica Napus_), wild\r\nmustard (_B. Sinapis_), wild mignonette (_Reseda lutea_), and nasturtium\r\n(_Tropaeolum majus_).\r\n\r\nThe eggs are conical in form--something like a sugar loaf, with ridges\r\nrunning from apex to base, and very delicate lines from ridge to ridge\r\ntransversely.\r\n\r\nThe young larvae often make their first meal of the shell, and then\r\nattack the food plant so voraciously that they are fully grown in about\r\nthree or four weeks. In colour they are of a beautiful glaucous green,\r\nhardly distinguishable at times from the leaves on which they rest. A\r\nyellow stripe runs along the middle of the back, and lines of yellow\r\nspots adorn the sides; and the whole body is covered with very short\r\nhairs, each one arising from a minute warty projection.\r\n\r\nThe pupae may be found during the same seasons and in the same situations\r\nas those of _Brassicae_. They are very variable in colour. Some are of a\r\nvery pale grey or putty colour, some are decidedly brown, and others of\r\na greenish tinge; and they are often spotted and striped with dark grey\r\nor black.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Green-veined White_ (_P. Napi_)\r\n\r\nA non-observant beginner at entomological work may easily mistake this\r\ninsect for the last species, for the ground colour and markings are very\r\nsimilar, even to the features by which the sexes are distinguished from\r\neach other; but an inspection of the under surface will give a ready\r\nmeans of identification, for here the wing rays are bordered with black\r\nscales which, by contrast with the rich yellow around them, often\r\nappear of a greenish hue. The butterfly receives its popular name from\r\nthis circumstance.\r\n\r\nA careful observer, however, will readily find distinguishing marks on\r\nthe upper side, for here also the chief 'veins' are more or less\r\naccompanied with black scales, especially the extremities of those of\r\nthe fore wings, where little triangular blotches are often distinctly\r\nformed; and the dark veining of the under surface of the hind wings\r\nfrequently shows through. The under side of this insect is shown on\r\nPlate I (fig. 5).\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is not so abundant as the two preceding, but is widely\r\ndistributed throughout England, and is in most parts decidedly\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nThe first brood (for it also is double-brooded) appears during April and\r\nMay, and the second in July and August.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are very similar to those of _Rapae_, resembling ribbed and\r\nstriated sugar loaves; and the larvae are of the same rich glaucous\r\ngreen, but may be identified by the black spiracles surrounded by yellow\r\nrings. In our gardens we may find both eggs and larvae on mignonette and\r\nhorse-radish; the other food plants of this species include the\r\nwater-cress (_Nasturtium officinale_), winter cress (_Barbarea\r\nvulgaris_), rape (_Brassica Napus_), cuckoo-flower (_Cardamine\r\npratensis_), and Jack-by-the-hedge (_Sisymbrium Alliaria_).\r\n\r\nThe pupa is greenish, and marked with small black dots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bath or Green-chequered White_ (_P. Daplidice_)\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that many butterflies migrate from one country to\r\nanother across the seas; and as the Bath White is very common on the\r\nother side of the Channel, and has been taken very sparingly in England\r\nalmost exclusively in the south-east, it is highly probable that the\r\nmajority of those that have been captured here are specimens that have\r\ntaken a voluntary trip across the water, or have been blown over during\r\nrough weather.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is one of our greatest rarities, and the capture of a\r\nspecimen in England is an event that must necessarily be recorded in our\r\nentomological literature. It seems that _Daplidice_ has bred in England,\r\nfor its caterpillars have been found at large on one or two occasions,\r\nso I will give a short description of the various stages of the insect,\r\nwith a hope that some of my readers may be fortunate enough to meet with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe female butterfly is shown on Plate I, fig. 6. From this it will be\r\nobserved that each of the fore wings is tipped with a rather large\r\nsmoky-black blotch, in which are four white spots. A double spot of the\r\nsame colour also occupies a place near the centre of the wing, and\r\nanother smaller and round one lies near the anal angle. The hind wings\r\nare clouded with grey, and bordered along the hind margin with distinct\r\nsmoky-black spots.\r\n\r\nThe male may be distinguished from the female by the absence of the spot\r\nnear the anal angle of the fore wings, and of all the clouds and spots\r\nof the hind wings. Nevertheless the latter have a decidedly clouded\r\nappearance, but this is due to the markings of the under surface showing\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nThe under side of both sexes is most beautifully marked--the fore wings\r\nresembling the upper sides, but the hind pair chequered with a beautiful\r\nsoft green on a pale yellow ground.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this insect are deposited during April and May, and again in\r\nAugust or September--for it is, like the other 'Whites,'\r\ndouble-brooded--on two species of Wild Mignonette (_Reseda lutea_ and\r\n_R. luteola_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--THE BATH WHITE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars, which are of a bluish colour, with two yellow stripes\r\ndown the back, and two others along the sides, may be _looked_ for in\r\nJune and September. Those of the first brood only have been taken in\r\nthis country, while the others on the Continent change to the chrysalis\r\nin the autumn, and hybernate in this state throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a brownish colour, and closely resembles that of the\r\nSmall White in form.\r\n\r\nThose in search of this rare British insect should wander along the\r\nsouth-east coast, and net all the doubtful slow-flying small Whites\r\n(_Daplidice_ is rather slow and heavy on the wing), and their\r\nperseverance _may_ be rewarded with a prize that will ever be a reminder\r\nof a glorious catch and an eventful day. If you fail in this, and most\r\nprobably you will, rather than remain a stranger to this beautiful and\r\ninteresting insect, fill up the blank in your cabinet with a foreign\r\nspecimen, which can be obtained at any time for a few pence, but be\r\ncareful to label it 'not British,' in order that your brother\r\ncollectors may not be deceived, or be led to make any unnecessary\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Orange Tip_ (_Euchlo[:e] Cardamines_)\r\n\r\nNo one could possibly mistake the male of this species for any other\r\nBritish butterfly, the popular name alone giving quite sufficient\r\ninformation for its identification, but the female Orange Tip is _not_\r\ntipped with orange, and its markings, both above and beneath, resemble\r\nthose of _Daplidice_ so nearly that the same written description might\r\napply almost equally well to both.\r\n\r\nOn Plate I (fig. 7) is shown the upper side of the male, and just\r\nopposite it (fig. 8) the under surface of the same. The female is\r\nusually a little larger than her mate, and is marked similarly on both\r\nsides except that the bright orange blotch is entirely wanting. She may\r\nalways be distinguished from _Daplidice_ by the smaller size of the\r\nwhite spots that break the dark blotch at the tip of the fore wing; also\r\nby the very small size of the dark spot in the centre of the same wing.\r\nThe green chequerings of the under side of the hind wings are also more\r\nsharply defined, and the insect is generally of a lighter build.\r\n\r\nLike many other butterflies, the Orange Tip is subject to variations in\r\ncolouring. Sometimes a pale but bright yellow takes the place of the\r\nwhite ground, and the orange blotch of the male is occasionally present\r\non the upper or lower surface only.\r\n\r\n_Cardamines_ is a single-brooded insect, and is essentially a creature\r\nof the spring, at which time it may be found in abundance in lanes,\r\nmeadows, and clearings in woods throughout the British Isles. Its flight\r\nis so light and airy that even the female may easily be distinguished\r\nfrom other Whites when on the wing, while the brilliant orange of the\r\nmale, intensified by the bright rays of the spring sun, may be\r\nidentified at some considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe food plants of _Cardamines_ include the cuckoo-flower (_Cardamine\r\npratensis_) and the bitter cress (_C. impatiens_), after which the\r\ninsect is named, also water-cress (_Nasturtium officinale_), winter\r\ncress (_Barbarea vulgaris_), rock cress (_Arabis perfoliata_), hedge\r\nmustard (_Sisymbrium officinale_), Jack-by-the-hedge (_S. Alliaria_),\r\nwild mustard (_Brassica Sinapis_), &c., and the eggs of the butterfly\r\nmay be found on these during May and June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar (Plate VIII, fig. 2) is green, with a white stripe on\r\neach side, and its body is covered with short hair. In July it is fully\r\ngrown, and ascends a stem of the food plant to prepare itself for its\r\nlong winter sleep.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis (Plate VIII, fig. 8) is a very peculiar object. Both ends\r\nare much elongated and sharply pointed; and the foremost extremity\r\nstands out at an angle with the stem to which it is attached.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly should be looked for during April and May, but in mild\r\nseasons it may often be met with in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wood White_ (_Leucophasia Sinapis_)\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of this butterfly (see Plate II, fig. 1) is\r\nthe extreme lightness and delicacy of its build. Its wings are narrow,\r\nand rounded at the tips; and the only mark to relieve the white ground\r\nof the upper side is a squarish blotch at the tip of the fore wing, and\r\neven this is either very indistinct or entirely absent in the female.\r\nThe under surface is clouded with a pale greenish tint.\r\n\r\nThis insect may be looked for in May and again in August, in paths and\r\nclearings in woods, where it moves along with a slow but steady flight,\r\nhardly ever seeming to rest for a moment. It is not by any means a\r\ncommon butterfly, but is very widely distributed, and sometimes appears\r\nin considerable numbers in certain favoured spots. Among the localities\r\nrecorded may be mentioned Torquay, Exeter, Plymouth, South Dorset, New\r\nForest, Reading, Darent Woods, Morecambe Bay, Haslemere, Windermere, &c.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a beautiful green colour, and is covered with\r\nshort whitish hairs. A darker green stripe runs down the middle of the\r\nback, and a bright yellow stripe along each side. Its food plants are\r\nthe tufted vetch (_Vicia Cracca_), bird's-foot trefoil (_Lotus\r\ncorniculatus_ and _L. pilosus_), bitter vetch (_Lathyrus tuberosus_),\r\nand the everlasting pea (_L. sylvestris_).\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is a very beautiful object. Its colour is a delicate\r\ngreen, tinged with pink; and the wing-cases project in beautiful curves\r\nmuch beyond the general surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pale Clouded Yellow_ (_Colias Hyale_)\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of this butterfly (Plate II, fig. 2) is very variable.\r\nIt is usually a sulphury yellow, and on this account the insect is\r\ncommonly known as the Clouded Brimstone; but sometimes the yellow is\r\nexceedingly pale--almost white--and tinged with green.\r\n\r\nA very large black blotch, broken by indefinite patches of the ground\r\ncolour, fills up the tip of each fore wing, and extends to the anal\r\nangle, becoming narrower as it approaches this point. A black oval spot\r\nlies just above the middle of this wing.\r\n\r\nThe hind wings are bordered with black, and a conspicuous spot of deep\r\nyellow lies very near the centre of each.\r\n\r\nThe antennae are rather short, compared with those of the preceding\r\nmembers of this family, and are distinguished by their reddish-brown\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe male and female of this species are similarly marked, but the ground\r\ncolour of the latter is commonly paler.\r\n\r\nThis is not by any means a very common butterfly with us, though it is\r\nvery plentiful on the other side of the Channel; but it has a way of\r\ntaking us by surprise in certain seasons, and then almost neglecting us\r\nfor several years together.\r\n\r\nIts head quarters are certainly the coasts of Kent and Sussex, but it\r\nhas been taken in considerable numbers as far west as Cornwall, and also\r\nto a less extent in some of the midland and northern counties. It is\r\nparticularly fond of lucerne and clover fields, especially those that\r\nare situated close to the sea cliffs; and often it may be seen flying\r\nover the beach, sometimes even flitting over the breakers away from land\r\ntill at last it disappears in the distance. This maritime tendency of\r\n_Hyale_ makes it probable that a large number of those that are seen on\r\nour south-east coasts have made a passage across the narrow end of the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid in spring, by females that have hybernated throughout\r\nthe winter, on various leguminous plants, including the lucerne\r\n(_Medicago sativa_), black medick (_M. lupulina_), purple and Dutch\r\nclovers (_Trifolium pratense_ and _T. repens_), and the bird's-foot\r\ntrefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_), and on these plants you may search for\r\nthe larva, though it can scarcely be said that you are likely to find\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with black dots, and a yellowish stripe on\r\neach side. When fully grown it ascends a stem of its food plant and\r\nchanges to a green chrysalis with yellow stripes.\r\n\r\n_Hyale_ is single-brooded in England, although two broods regularly\r\nappear on the Continent. In our country the perfect insects emerge\r\nduring July and August. Many of these die before the approach of winter;\r\nbut, as we have already observed, some hybernate and deposit their eggs\r\nin the following spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Clouded Yellow_ (_Colias Edusa_)\r\n\r\nNot only are this and the last species similarly named, but a glance at\r\nthe figures will show that they much resemble each other in appearance;\r\nand we shall also learn presently that in their habits and life history\r\nthey have much in common.\r\n\r\nThe male _Edusa_ is shown on Plate II (fig. 3), and when we compare it\r\nwith its relative on the opposite side, we are at once struck with the\r\nsuperior richness of the brilliant orange or saffron of the ground\r\ncolour. The black border of both fore and hind wings is also denser,\r\nwider, and more extensive. The whole of the yellow area of the hind\r\nwings is dusted more or less with black scales, with the exception of a\r\nround central spot of deep orange, corresponding with the orange spots\r\non the hind wings of _Hyale_.\r\n\r\nThe female, which is shown in the accompanying woodcut, is generally\r\nlarger than the male, and is further distinguished by the very pale\r\nyellow spots that break the black border of both pairs of wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--THE CLOUDED YELLOW--FEMALE.]\r\n\r\n_Edusa_ further resembles _Hyale_ in the reddish colour of the antennae;\r\nand, in both the species, the red legs form a pleasing contrast with the\r\nyellow furry surface of the under side of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the female of this butterfly, in which the ground\r\ncolour is a _very pale_ yellow, almost white. The hind wings are more\r\nthickly dusted with black scales than in the normal insect, and the\r\norange spots of these wings show up much more conspicuously from the\r\ncontrast with their surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to apply distinct names to constant varieties of\r\nspecies--names that are to be added to the ordinary title. In this\r\nparticular case the distinguishing name is _Helice_, so that we should\r\nspeak of the variety of _Edusa_ above mentioned as:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colias Edusa_, var. _Helice_\r\n\r\nLike _Hyale_, _Edusa_ is particularly capricious in its appearance. In\r\ncertain summers it absolutely swarms in favourite localities, while\r\nduring the intervals between such remarkable appearances--usually\r\nseveral years--it is positively scarce. The last favoured season was the\r\nsummer of '92, during which (from the beginning of August to the end of\r\nthe summer) dozens might easily have been caught in an hour or two; in\r\nfact, so plentiful were they in many places, that they were continuously\r\nin sight, often several at one time.\r\n\r\nThose in search of this insect should repair to the south coast,\r\nespecially the south-east, and where lucerne and clover fields are in\r\nflower. It has very decided maritime tendencies, and may often be seen\r\nflying over the cliffs and beaches, and even skipping over the breakers;\r\nbut, at the same time, it is more or less plentiful in many inland\r\ndistricts. It has been taken in many parts of Ireland and Scotland,\r\nparticularly along the southern coasts of these countries; but its head\r\nquarters are undoubtedly the southern cliffs of England, from Cornwall\r\nto Kent, and also the hilly inland districts of the south-eastern\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\n_Edusa_ catching is very lively sport, and is likely to prove sufficient\r\nfor any lover of outdoor exercise under a scorching sun; for this\r\nbutterfly is not only very powerful on the wing, but its flights are\r\nusually long, so that a good run is often absolutely necessary in order\r\nto capture it. On very hilly ground, such as _Edusa_ loves, chase is\r\noften hopeless, and then it is necessary to resort to stratagem. In such\r\na case the best plan is to make a very cautious approach when the insect\r\nhas been observed to settle, and then secure it with a sudden\r\ndown-stroke of the net.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid during May and June by a few females that have\r\nsurvived the winter.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar may be found in June and July on its food plants, the\r\nchief of which are the bird's-foot trefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_), and\r\nthe purple and Dutch clovers (_Trifolium pratense_ and _T. repens_). Its\r\ncolour is grass-green, and it is marked with a narrow whitish stripe on\r\neach side, which is broken by the yellow of the spiracles.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a pale yellowish green, and is marked with yellow\r\nstripes and reddish-brown dots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brimstone_ (_Gonopteryx Rhamni_)\r\n\r\nThis, the last member of the present family, is remarkable for the\r\ngraceful outline of its wings. The costal margins of the fore pair are\r\nmost beautifully arched, and both pairs are sharply angled on the hind\r\nmargins. This latter characteristic is quite unique among British\r\nbutterflies, though we shall presently meet with instances of angular\r\nprojections on hind wings only.\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of the male (Plate II, fig. 4) is a rich sulphury\r\nyellow, with a greenish tinge. That of the female is a very pale\r\ngreenish yellow. The only conspicuous markings are small saffron spots,\r\none near the centre of each wing. The antennae are red, short, and\r\nbeautifully curved; but, unlike the two preceding species, the legs are\r\nalmost white.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this butterfly are laid in April on the two species of\r\nbuckthorn (_Rhamnus catharticus_ and _R. Frangula_) by the females that\r\nhave successfully weathered the winter. They are of a bright yellow\r\ncolour, and are usually hatched in about a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe body of the caterpillar is green, and it is thickly covered with\r\nlittle black wart-like projections. A pale stripe also runs along each\r\nside. During May and June it may be found on its food plants, and toward\r\nthe end of the latter month it attaches itself by a silken carpet and\r\nbelt to the under side of one of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a very peculiar shape, the body being curved, and\r\nthe wing cases standing out prominently beyond the general surface. Its\r\ncolour is a bright apple green marked with yellow, and it is so\r\ntransparent that certain of the structures can be seen through its skin.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect emerges in about three weeks after the change to the\r\nchrysalis; and may be looked for from July to the end of the summer.\r\nThis period may be regarded as the best time in which to hunt for\r\n_Rhamni_, but it is to be noted that this butterfly makes its appearance\r\nduring all months of the year, even though it is single-brooded.\r\n\r\nA large number seem to hybernate, and their winter sleep is so light\r\nthat the welcome rays of the sun on a mild day, even during the bleak\r\nmonths of November to February, will often call them out from their\r\nhiding places. Then, as a rule, the hybernating butterflies do not live\r\nlong after depositing their eggs for the future brood; but the Brimstone\r\noften lives on till its offspring have themselves attained the perfect\r\nstate, so that it is possible to capture the insects of two different\r\nyears both on the same day. In such a case it is generally easy to\r\ndistinguish between the two, for the newly emerged specimens are\r\nbeautifully bright and fresh in colour, while those of the previous year\r\nare more or less faded and worn, their wings being often\r\nsemi-transparent through the loss of scales, and frequently disfigured\r\nby the stains of mildew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_THE FRITILLARIES, VANESSAS, AND THE PURPLE EMPEROR_\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--NYMPHALIDAE\r\n\r\nWe now come to a rather large family, which contains some of our largest\r\nand most brilliant butterflies. Some of them display the most gaudy\r\ncolours, and others exhibit patches of a beautiful metallic lustre.\r\n\r\nIf you were to see all the members of this family side by side, they\r\nmight strike you as being so varied in their appearance that you would\r\nwonder why they are all placed in one family group. But, were you to\r\nsee, in addition to the perfect insects, all their larvae and\r\nchrysalides, the reason would be made clear at once, for these earlier\r\nstages are seen to resemble each other in certain points at the very\r\nfirst glance. The former are all provided with peculiar spines, and the\r\nlatter are all more or less angular, and are all suspended to a silken\r\ncarpet by means of hooks at the tip of the abdomen, and have no belt as\r\nwe have observed in the case of the _Pieridae_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects, too, although so varied in colouring, are alike in\r\nthat they have only four walking legs, the first pair being so\r\nimperfectly developed as to be useless for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThis family includes the Fritillaries and the Vanessas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Pearl-bordered Fritillary_ (_Argynnis Selene_)\r\n\r\nThe interesting group of butterflies known as the Fritillaries vary\r\nconsiderably in size, but are remarkably uniform in the ground colour of\r\nthe wings, which, in all cases, is a rich golden or sienna brown; and\r\nthis ground is chequered with darker colours in such a manner as to\r\nremind one of the petals of the wild flower known as the Snake's Head\r\nor Fritillary--hence the popular name of the group.\r\n\r\nThe Small Pearl-bordered, our first example, is one of the lesser\r\nFritillaries, and is shown in Plate II (fig. 5).\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the black markings on the upper surface will be\r\nreadily made out from the coloured plate, but the pattern of the under\r\nside will require a little special notice, for it is here, as with the\r\nother Fritillaries, that we find the chief marks by which we identify\r\nthe species. On this side (fig. 67) the fore wings are light orange\r\nbrown, with a patch of darker brown near the tips, and spotted with a\r\ndull black. The hind wings have the light brown displaced by a very warm\r\nchestnut tint, some yellow, and bright silvery spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--THE SMALL PEARL-BORDERED FRITILLARY--UNDER\r\nSIDE.]\r\n\r\nSeven silvery spots of triangular form border the hind margin. A large\r\none occupies the centre of the wing, and ten others are somewhat\r\nirregularly scattered over other parts of the wing--five between the\r\ncentral spot and the hind margin, and five between it and the costa.\r\n\r\nAll the spots on these wings, whether yellow, chestnut, or silver, are\r\nbordered by a narrow black line.\r\n\r\n_Selene_ is not a very abundant butterfly, but is widely distributed in\r\nEngland, and is also found in parts of Scotland. Its favourite resorts\r\nare clearings in woods, especially those of Kent and other southern\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nIt appears in May and June, in which latter month it deposits its eggs\r\non the dog violet (_Viola canina_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is not fully grown at the end of the summer, and\r\nhybernates during the winter among the roots of its food plant. In the\r\nfollowing spring it emerges again, and feeds till May, when it changes\r\nto the chrysalis on a stem. It is less than an inch long when fully\r\ngrown, and is of a dark-brown colour. Six rows of hairy spines are\r\narranged longitudinally on its body.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is greyish brown, and has a number of very short\r\nprojections corresponding with the spines of the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pearl-bordered Fritillary_ (_Argynnis Euphrosyne_)\r\n\r\nThere is very little difference in the size of this and that of the last\r\nspecies, but _Euphrosyne_ (Plate II, fig. 6) is generally a trifle\r\nlarger. The two butterflies are also very similar in appearance; indeed,\r\nthey are so much alike on the upper side that it is impossible to decide\r\non the name of either without an examination of the under surface.\r\n\r\n_Euphrosyne_ has a border of seven triangular silver spots on each hind\r\nwing, exactly corresponding with those of _Selene_. It has also the\r\nlarge central spot of silver. But, beside these, there is _only one_\r\nother, and that is situated in the basal angle. Thus there are only nine\r\nsilvery or pearly spots on each hind wing of _Euphrosyne_, while there\r\nare seventeen on _Selene_. This will form a ready means of\r\ndistinguishing between the two species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--THE PEARL-BORDERED FRITILLARY--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe seasons and localities of this butterfly correspond very closely\r\nwith those of the last species, but it is much more common, and may be\r\nfound in abundance in nearly all our southern woods during May and June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, also, feeds on the same plant (dog violet) as _Selene_.\r\nIt is black, with whitish lines along the sides; and is provided with a\r\nnumber of bristly spines.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a grey-brown colour, with small dots of a paler tint\r\non the wing cases; and its body has a number of short conical\r\nprojections exactly corresponding with the spines of the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of Spain Fritillary_ (_Argynnis Latona_)\r\n\r\nWe now pass from the commonest to the rarest and most prized of our wood\r\nbutterflies--The Queen of Spain (Plate II, fig. 7). This royal personage\r\nis not easily mistaken for any of the meaner Fritillaries even when the\r\nupper surface only is examined, as the concave hind margins of the fore\r\nwings serve as an almost conclusive mark of distinction. The rich tawny\r\nbrown of this side is boldly marked with black, and the long hairs and\r\nscales of the bases of the wings are tinged with green.\r\n\r\nThe under side presents a most beautiful appearance. Here the ground\r\ncolour is paler than that of the upper side. The fore wings are spotted\r\nwith black, and have a few small patches of silver at the tips. Each\r\nhind wing has no fewer than twenty-four bright silvery spots. Seven of\r\nthese, mostly of large size, adorn the hind margin, and above each of\r\nthese is a small one in the middle of a little patch of dark brown. The\r\narrangement of the others is not quite so easily described, but may be\r\nreadily made out from our illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--THE QUEEN OF SPAIN FRITILLARY--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis rare gem among British butterflies has been taken in many\r\nlocalities, but in very small numbers. Seeing that it is a common insect\r\non the other side of the Channel, and that the British captures have\r\nbeen made chiefly in the Isle of Wight and on the south coast, I am\r\ninclined to believe that many of the highly valued genuine Britishers\r\nhave no right to their title, but are visitors that have spent only a\r\nfew days within our shores, having flown or been blown across the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that many of my readers will ever meet with _Latona_\r\nduring their rambles in our own country, and if they are anxious to have\r\nthe species represented in their collections, they will probably have to\r\npurchase either a British or a foreign specimen, the former of which\r\nwill command a very high price, while the latter may be obtained for\r\nthree or four pence.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect may be looked for in August and September, during\r\nwhich time the eggs are laid on the leaves of violets and the heartsease\r\n(_Viola canina_, _V. odorata_, and _V. tricolor_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is brown, with numerous yellowish spines, and has three\r\nwhitish or yellowish stripes--one down the middle of the back and one\r\nalong each side. It hybernates during the winter, and is fully grown in\r\nthe following June or July. I hope that my reader will be so fortunate\r\nas to secure either this or some other stage of this rare and beautiful\r\ninsect. The chances are decidedly against him, but that is no reason\r\nwhy he should abstain from a vigorous search when he happens to be\r\n'doing' the southern counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dark-green Fritillary_ (_Argynnis Aglaia_)\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is larger than _Latona_, as will be seen by reference to\r\nPlate II, fig. 8. Its colour is, as usual with the Fritillaries, a tawny\r\nbrown with black markings. The female is usually larger than the male,\r\nand she is further distinguished by the ground colour being darker and\r\nthe black markings larger.\r\n\r\nThe under side of the fore wings is very similar in colour and markings\r\nto the upper, but there are silvery spots near the tips. The hind wings\r\nare beautifully tinted with olive green and brown, and studded with\r\nsilver. The arrangement of the latter is not easily described, but is\r\naccurately represented in the accompanying woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--THE DARK-GREEN FRITILLARY--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe favourite resorts of this insect are wooded spots, and also heaths\r\nand downs clad with heather or ferns, where its food plant (the dog\r\nviolet) lies scattered; but it seems to be less partial to woods than\r\nthe other Fritillaries. It is very widely distributed throughout\r\nEngland, and is common in parts of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is on the wing in July and early August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar first appears toward the end of August, and commences\r\nits period of hybernation among the roots of its food plant before it\r\nhas grown to any considerable size. It comes out again in the spring,\r\nand continues to feed till the beginning or middle of July, and then\r\nchanges to the chrysalis state, after protecting itself by binding three\r\nor four leaves together.\r\n\r\nIts colour is a velvety black, with dark and glossy grey between the\r\nsegments. There is a double yellow line along the back, and a thin line\r\nof orange yellow on each side below the spiracles. It has a number of\r\nblack hairy spines, arranged in six longitudinal rows.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a shiny black colour, with brownish abdomen; and the\r\nconical projections are black with yellow tips.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The High-brown Fritillary_ (_Argynnis Adippe_)\r\n\r\nThe upper side of this butterfly is so much like that of _Aglaia_ that\r\nit would be difficult indeed to give a written description of one that\r\ndid not almost equally well apply to the other; so we look to the under\r\nsurface for the chief marks by which we can distinguish between them.\r\n\r\nOn this side (Plate III, fig. 1) the fore wings are much the same as\r\nthose of _Aglaia_. The hind wings, too, are very similarly coloured and\r\nmarked, but here we have a distinguishing feature in a row of rust-red\r\nspots with silvery centres, just inside the silver border of the hind\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--THE HIGH-BROWN FRITILLARY.]\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is common in open spaces of woods in many parts of\r\nEngland, more particularly in the south, and seems to be also fond of\r\nhilly heaths and moors.\r\n\r\nIt is on the wing in July, and, towards the end of this month and in the\r\nbeginning of August, the eggs are laid on the leaves of the dog violet\r\n(_Viola canina_) and heartsease (_V. tricolor_).\r\n\r\nThe young caterpillar emerges about two weeks later, and feeds only for\r\na short time before it seeks out its winter quarters among the dead\r\nleaves at the root of its food plant. The feeding is resumed in the\r\nspring, and continued till the month of June, when it is fully grown. At\r\nthis time it is about an inch and a half long. Its head is black, and\r\nits body pinkish brown. A white line extends down the back, but is\r\ninterrupted by several black marks. The spines, of which there are six\r\nrows, are white, with pinkish tips.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Silver-washed Fritillary_ (_Argynnis Paphia_)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and noble butterfly is the largest of the Fritillaries,\r\nand the most powerful on the wing. During the latter part of June and\r\nthroughout July it may be seen gracefully sweeping through the trees and\r\nundergrowth of woods, often settling down on a favourite flower for a\r\nshort time. So strong is its flight that it is useless to attempt to\r\npursue it for any distance. Sometimes it will sail along a wooded path,\r\nfollowed at short intervals by others of its species, and may be taken\r\nin the net as it passes. But perhaps the most successful method of\r\nnetting _Paphia_ is to wait till it has settled, and then secure it by a\r\nquick upward or side stroke of the net. If then you miss your aim, off\r\nit will dart, sailing over the tree tops till, in a very short time, it\r\nis quite out of sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--THE SILVER-WASHED FRITILLARY--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe upper side of this butterfly is shown in Plate III, fig. 2, where\r\nthe general arrangement of the black spots on the rich orange-brown\r\nground is carefully marked. There is a considerable difference between\r\nthe male and female of this species. The figure on Plate III represents\r\nthe male. The female does not possess the broad black lines that follow\r\nthe course of the veins of the fore wings; the basal portions of all\r\nfour wings are also tinged with a rich olive-brown colour, often with a\r\ndecided tendency to green; and the black spots of all the wings are\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nThe under side is particularly rich in its decorations. The front wings\r\nare of the usual orange brown, chequered with black. The hind wings are\r\npartly brown and partly orange, and exhibit beautiful greenish\r\nreflections. They have also two bars of silver, and a silvery spot in\r\nthe basal angle, all with rather indefinite outlines.\r\n\r\nThe female lays her eggs late in July on the food plants (_Viola canina_\r\nand _V. odorata_) or on the moss that surrounds them.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later the young caterpillar is out and feeding; and\r\nthen, after a few more weeks, while it is yet very small, it hides among\r\nthe dead leaves at the roots. Early in the spring it resumes its\r\nfeeding, and is full grown at the end of May.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar (Plate VIII, fig. 3) is black, and there\r\nare two yellow lines along the back, separated by a black stripe, also\r\none yellowish line on each side. Its body is adorned with reddish-brown\r\nspines, two of which, situated just behind the head, are longer than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis (Plate VIII, fig. 9) is greyish, marked with metallic\r\nspots, and has a number of angular projections representing the spines\r\nof the larva.\r\n\r\n_Paphia_ is to be met with in woods in all parts of England and Wales.\r\nIt has also been observed in Ireland, but is rarely seen in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Greasy Fritillary_ (_Melitaea Aurinia_)\r\n\r\nUnlike the other Fritillaries, this species (Plate III, fig. 3) exhibits\r\na variety of shades on the upper surface. A broad band of sienna brown\r\nstretches across each wing, near to and parallel with the hind margin.\r\nThe other parts of the wings are marked with patches of sienna, orange,\r\nand yellow, separated by black lines and bands. The margins are all\r\nblack, and inside the broader margin of the hind wing is a row of six\r\nvery pale yellow spots. The broad sienna band of the hind wing is also\r\ndivided by narrow black lines into seven parts, six of which have black\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--THE GREASY FRITILLARY--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe under surface of the fore wings has indefinite yellowish and tawny\r\npatches, which look as if they had been greased and smeared. The hind\r\nwings are marked with pale yellow and deep orange; a broad band of the\r\nlatter, near the hind margin, is divided into segments, each of which\r\nhas a yellow spot with black in the centre.\r\n\r\nThis is a very local insect, although it is widely distributed\r\nthroughout England and Wales. It also occurs sparingly in Scotland and\r\nIreland. Its food plants are the honeysuckle (_Lonicera_\r\n_Periclymenum_), devil's-bit scabious (_Scabiosa succisa_), and the\r\nplantain (_Plantago_); and its chief resorts are damp meadows and marshy\r\nplaces, where these plants (more especially the scabious) abound.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly appears about the end of April or in June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars emerge from the eggs towards the end of the latter\r\nmonth, and always feed in groups under the cover of a silken web. Like\r\nthe preceding species they hybernate during the winter, and commence\r\nfeeding again in the spring. They are fully grown about the end of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nIn colour the caterpillar is velvety black, dotted with white, and its\r\nbody is covered with short bristly spines. When fully fed it seeks the\r\nshelter of a curled leaf or dense herbage, suspends itself by the hind\r\nclaspers to a silken carpet, and then changes to a creamy white\r\nchrysalis with black dots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Glanville Fritillary_ (_Melitaea Cinxia_)\r\n\r\nThe pattern of the upper side of this Fritillary (Plate III, fig. 4) is\r\nvery similar to that of _Aurinia_, but the ground colour is a uniform\r\ntawny brown, and the fringes of the wings are of a very pale straw\r\ncolour, barred with black.\r\n\r\nThe under side of the fore wings is tawny brown, with straw-coloured\r\ntips bearing black markings. The hind wings have four alternate bands of\r\nbrown and straw colour, and a patch of straw colour at the base. The\r\nmarginal yellow band has six or seven black spots. The brown band next\r\nto it is divided into six segments with black borders, each with a black\r\nspot. The next yellow band has also a row of black spots. The inner\r\nfulvous band is very irregular; and inside this is the yellow base with\r\nsix spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--THE GLANVILLE FRITILLARY--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis is another local insect--very local indeed, for it seems to have\r\nbeen found only in a few spots outside its head quarters, the Isle of\r\nWight. Those in search of it should carefully scan the rough cliffy\r\nparts of the island, wherever the species of plantain (_Plantago\r\nCoronopus_ and _P. maritima_) are plentiful, these being the food plants\r\nof the larvae. It first appears on the wing in May, but may be found till\r\nthe end of June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars, which are black and spiny, with reddish head and legs,\r\nbegin to feed in August, and as soon as the chilly weather sets in they\r\nhybernate in groups under the cover of a tent constructed by binding\r\ntogether leaves or blades of grass. In the spring they start out again,\r\nand feed till the end of April, at which time they change to dark\r\nbrownish and smooth chrysalides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Heath Fritillary_ (_Melitaea Athalia_)\r\n\r\nBoth the upper and under sides of this butterfly are shown on Plate III\r\n(figs. 5 and 6), and it will be observed from these that its general\r\nappearance is very similar to that of _Cinxia_.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface is of the same tawny brown, barred and striped with\r\nblack, and the fringes of the wings are pale yellow, interrupted by\r\nsmall patches of black.\r\n\r\nThe under surface of the fore wings has the same ground colour with the\r\nexception of the tips, which are yellow; and the whole is marked with\r\nblack, as in the illustration. The hind wings are pale yellow, with two\r\nbroad bands of brown corresponding with those of _Cinxia_; but a series\r\nof black double arches along the hind margin and the _absence_ of rows\r\nof black spots serve to distinguish this species from the last.\r\n\r\n_Athalia_ is another local butterfly, but is sometimes found in\r\nabundance in the spots which it frequents. It is met with chiefly in the\r\nopen spaces of woods along the south coast and for some distance inland.\r\nDevon, Cornwall, Sussex, and Kent seem to be the most favoured counties;\r\nand London entomologists would do well to search for it in Epping\r\nForest.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly deposits its eggs during June and July, on several\r\ndifferent food plants, the chief of which are the greater and\r\nnarrow-leaved plantains (_Plantago major_ and _P. lanceolata_), foxglove\r\n(_Digitalis purpurea_), two species of cow-wheat (_Melampyrum pratense_\r\nand _M. sylvaticum_), wood sage (_Teucrium Scorodonia_), and the\r\ngermander speedwell (_Veronica Chamaedrys_), and the young caterpillars,\r\nafter feeding for only a week or two, commence their period of\r\nhybernation. They resume their feeding in April, and change to the pupal\r\nstate about the end of May.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is velvety black, finely dotted with\r\nwhite, and the spines are yellow or orange, tipped with white.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is creamy white, banded and patched with orange and\r\nblack, and is suspended by anal hooks from a silken, carpet which the\r\ncaterpillar had spun on the leaf of the food plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Comma_ (_Vanessa C-Album_)\r\n\r\nLeaving the Fritillaries, we now come to a genus (Vanessa) that includes\r\nseven most beautiful butterflies, some of which are so common as to be\r\nknown to almost everybody.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this genus belongs to the same family as the\r\nFritillaries, and we may therefore expect to find that the two groups\r\npossess features in common. A slight examination of a few in their\r\ndifferent stages will show that this is so. Thus, the perfect insects\r\nhave only four walking legs, the caterpillars are all spiny, and the\r\nchrysalides are angular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--THE COMMA--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThere is another feature concerning the chrysalides worthy of note. Like\r\nsome of the pupae of the Fritillaries, they are adorned more or less with\r\nbrilliant metallic spots, sometimes of a rich golden hue, and sometimes\r\nresembling burnished silver. Now the word 'chrysalis,' which, as we have\r\nalready seen, is derived from a Greek word meaning 'gold,' was\r\noriginally applied to the pupae of some of the Vanessas, on account of\r\ntheir metallic decorations, but it has since been extended to the pupae\r\nof all the Lepidoptera, and also to other orders of insects, even though\r\nthe greater number of them display no tints of the precious metal.\r\n\r\nThe first member for our consideration is the Comma Butterfly, of which\r\nan illustration is given in Plate III, fig. 7. No one could mistake this\r\nbeautiful butterfly for any other British species, for its wings of rich\r\norange brown, with black and dark-brown markings, are so irregularly\r\nscalloped on the hind margins that they present a somewhat ragged\r\nappearance. Its name is derived from the fact that a white mark\r\nsomething like the letter C, or, as some have it, like a comma, is\r\ndistinctly painted on the dark brown of the under side.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly generally emerges from the chrysalis late in the\r\nsummer--August and September, but it is often seen earlier, and\r\nfrequently as late as October. It is a great lover of sweets, and may be\r\nfound settled on various flowers and fruits. Its chief food plants are\r\nthe hop (_Humulus Lupulus_), red currant (_Ribes rubrum_), stinging\r\nnettle (_Urtica dioica_), and the Elm (_Ulmus campestris_).\r\n\r\nIt is very abundant in certain districts where hops are grown, but seems\r\nto avoid those counties that border the sea. It is widely distributed in\r\nthe midland counties, and extends to the north of England and into\r\nScotland, but is very capricious in its appearance in many parts.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid in May by females that have hybernated through the\r\nwinter, and the caterpillars may be found feeding during July and\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is coloured grey and brown, with a black head, and a\r\nbroad white stripe down the back of the hindermost segments. The body is\r\narmed with a number of spines, some of which are white, and others pale\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is a very peculiar object, having two ear-like projections\r\nextending forwards from the sides of the head. It has a number of\r\nangular projections, and is of an umber-brown colour, finely netted with\r\nblack lines, and having several spots of a brilliant metallic lustre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Tortoiseshell_ (_Vanessa Polychloros_)\r\n\r\nOur two tortoiseshells--large and small--are very similar in their\r\ncolour and markings, and moreover are not always to be distinguished by\r\ntheir size, for specimens of the larger species are sometimes even\r\ninferior in this respect to the largest of the smaller species; so, to\r\navoid all risks of mistaken identity, we must look for more reliable\r\nmarks of distinction between them.\r\n\r\nThe present species is figured on Plate III (fig. 8), where it will be\r\nseen that the ground colour of dark tawny brown is spotted and bordered\r\nwith black. The border of the hind wings contains a row of\r\ncrescent-shaped blue spots. The costal margin of the fore wings, between\r\nthe black patches, is decidedly lighter than the general ground, and is\r\nyellow rather than brown. It will be noticed, too, that a black spot\r\nlies very near the anal angle of these wings.\r\n\r\nThe under surface, though by no means brilliant, exhibits a rich\r\nblending of various shades of brown.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is not known to occur in either Scotland or Ireland, and\r\nis by no means common in England. Its chief localities are in the\r\nmidland and eastern counties.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect generally appears about the middle of July, and after\r\nspending a month or six weeks on the wing, seeks out a sheltered spot in\r\nwhich to spend the winter. In the spring--April or May--it again takes\r\nto flight, and during the latter month the females are busily engaged in\r\nthe deposition of their eggs.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the two species of elm (_Ulmus campestris_ and\r\n_U. montana_), willow (_Salix alba_), sallow (_S. Caprea_), osier (_S.\r\nviminalis_), aspen (_Populus tremula_), and certain fruit trees; and is\r\nfull grown about midsummer. It is of a tawny grey colour, with a black\r\nstripe on each side, and is covered with very small wart-like\r\nprojections, and the spines are branched.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a dull pinkish colour, and may be found on tree\r\ntrunks, palings, and walls, about the end of June, suspended from a\r\nsilken carpet by means of its anal hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Tortoiseshell_ (_Vanessa Urticae_)\r\n\r\n_Urticae_ (Plate III, fig. 9) may be distinguished from _Polychloros_ by\r\nthe _absence_ of the black spot in the anal angle of the fore wings of\r\nthe latter. It has also a white spot near the tip of each fore\r\nwing-between the black border and the first black costal patch. The\r\nwhole of the base of the hind wing is also black, and the ground colour\r\nis decidedly brighter.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the commonest of all British butterflies, and is to be\r\nfound more or less abundantly in nearly all parts of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe hybernated perfect insects come out early in the spring, and lay\r\ntheir eggs in close irregular clusters on nettles (_Urtica dioica_ and\r\n_U. urens_). Shortly after the gregarious caterpillars may be found on\r\nthese plants in dense masses. They change to the chrysalis state about\r\nthe end of May, and from this time there is a continuous succession of\r\nbutterflies till the end of the summer.\r\n\r\nThe later specimens, which do not emerge till September or October,\r\nspend only a short time on the wing, and then hybernate till the spring,\r\ngiving rise to the first brood of the following season.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species is black above and greyish beneath. It\r\nis thickly covered with yellow dots, which are so close together on the\r\nback as to form two yellowish stripes, separated only by a fine black\r\nline. There are also two yellowish stripes along each side; and the\r\nbody, as with the rest of this genus, is spiny, the spines in this case\r\nbeing black or very dark green.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is brownish, and spotted with burnished gold in variable\r\nquantity--sometimes so plentifully as to cover the greater part of the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peacock_ (_Vanessa Io_)\r\n\r\nThis is another of our commonest and most beautiful butterflies. Its\r\ngeneral appearance is such that it cannot possibly be mistaken for any\r\nother. The upper side (Plate IV, fig. 1) is rendered conspicuous by the\r\nbeautiful eye-like marks at the costal angles of all four wings; and the\r\nunder surface is very richly decorated with a fine arrangement of black\r\nand dark-brown patches and streaks.\r\n\r\nIo is very abundant in all parts of England, and is well known in many\r\nparts of Scotland and Ireland, but seems to be rare in the extreme north\r\nof both of these countries.\r\n\r\nIts food plant is the stinging nettle (_Urtica dioica_), and on this the\r\neggs are laid in April by females that have hybernated during the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is full grown at the end of June or beginning of July.\r\nIt is black, with numerous minute white wart-like projections. Its\r\nspines also are black, and its claspers brown.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis may be found suspended by the tail on some object in the\r\nneighbourhood of the food plant, or sometimes on the food plant itself.\r\nIt is of a greenish colour, with yellowish patches, but turns darker as\r\nthe time approaches for the emerging of the perfect insect.\r\n\r\nThis event takes place in August, and the butterfly, after a brief\r\nperiod on the wing, seeks out a sheltered spot for its winter nap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Camberwell Beauty_ (_Vanessa Antiopa_)\r\n\r\nThe reader will be fortunate if he succeeds in netting a specimen of\r\nthis highly prized British butterfly. It derives its popular name from\r\nthe fact that a few were taken in Camberwell about a hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago; and since that time it has been seen and taken in variable\r\nnumbers in several parts of England. So widely distributed, indeed, are\r\nits localities, and so few, comparatively, its appearances, that it\r\nwould be useless to attempt to give any hints as to where it may be\r\nlooked for. It is, however, a very common butterfly in many continental\r\ncountries, and foreign specimens may be obtained from any dealer in\r\nentomological wares for a few pence each.\r\n\r\nThis rare British gem is illustrated in fig. 2 of Plate IV. Here it will\r\nbe seen that nearly the whole of the surface is covered with a rich\r\nvelvety purple brown, bordered with a black band containing blue spots;\r\nand outside this is a border of white, finely dotted and streaked with\r\nblack. The continental specimens may be easily distinguished from the\r\ngenuine Britishers by a darker border with a decidedly yellow tinge.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are generally laid on the young leaves of the\r\nwillow (_Salix alba_), in the spring, by females that have hybernated,\r\nbut sometimes the nettle (_Urtica dioica_) and the birch (_Betula alba_)\r\nare selected for the food of the larvae.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is black and spiny, and has a row of seven rather large\r\nreddish-brown spots on the back, commencing at the fifth segment.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis, like those of the other members of this family, is\r\nangular and suspended by the 'tail.' The perfect insect appears in\r\nAugust, and may be seen from that month till October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Red Admiral_ (_Vanessa Atalanta_)\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a tendency with many to under-estimate the beauty of\r\ncertain natural objects because they happen to be so very common, and\r\nthis is particularly the case with some of our most familiar\r\nbutterflies. The beautiful Red Admiral (Plate IV, fig. 3) may possibly\r\nsuffer in this respect; for, not only is it one of the commonest of our\r\nbutterflies, but it fearlessly hovers among the flowers of our gardens,\r\noften venturing into the very heart of thickly populated towns.\r\n\r\nThe bright scarlet bands and white blotches of this gorgeous insect\r\nstand out boldly on the rich velvety black ground of the wings, and the\r\nadditional touches of blue in the anal angles of the hind wings add to\r\nthe effect. The under side of the fore wings is somewhat similar to the\r\nupper surface, but is relieved by brown and blue; and this side of the\r\nhind wings presents most beautiful and indescribable blendings of\r\nvarious shades of brown, grey, and pink. The female may be\r\ndistinguished by the presence of a small white spot on the scarlet band\r\nof the fore wing.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited singly on the nettle (_Urtica dioica_) in spring\r\nby females that have hybernated through the winter.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar always feeds under the cover of a tent made by drawing\r\nleaves together. It is spiny, and its colour is usually a greenish or\r\nyellowish grey, spotted with black, and striped along the sides with\r\nwhite or yellow. When fully grown it bites the stem of the nettle nearly\r\nthrough a few inches from the top, so that the upper part of the plant\r\nbends over the withers. It then constructs a commodious tent by binding\r\nthe leaves of this drooping portion together, and suspends itself from\r\nthe roof of this strange home to undergo its metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nThe change to the chrysalis state takes place in July or August, and the\r\nperfect insect may be seen during August, September, and October in\r\nalmost every part of the British Isles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Painted Lady_ (_Vanessa Cardui_)\r\n\r\nAlthough the time of appearance of this butterfly generally corresponds\r\nwith that of the last species, yet it is exceedingly variable, so much\r\nso that it is impossible to give any fixed period as its season. It is,\r\nmoreover, very capricious with regard to its localities and its numbers.\r\nSometimes it will turn up unexpectedly in positive abundance in certain\r\nlocalities where previously it had been a mere straggler; and then, for\r\nsome unaccountable reason, become comparatively scarce for several\r\nsuccessive seasons.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of this beauty (Plate IV, fig. 4) is adorned with pale\r\nred, orange, and black, and with five white spots near the tip of each\r\nfore wing. The under side of the fore wings is marked something like the\r\nupper, but much of the black is replaced by shades of brown. The hind\r\nwings are beautifully variegated beneath with greys and browns, and have\r\na row of eye-like spots near the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this butterfly are laid singly on various species of\r\nthistles, particularly the common field thistle (_Cnicus arvensis_),\r\ngenerally in the month of June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, which is black above and red beneath, with yellowish\r\nstripes along the back and sides, feeds under the cover of a silken web\r\nwhich it constructs among the leaves. It is full grown in July or\r\nAugust, when it suspends itself after the manner of the other Vanessas\r\nprevious to undergoing its changes.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is angular, coloured with brown and grey, and adorned with\r\nbrilliant gold spots.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect may be seen at large throughout late summer and the\r\nautumn, and the eggs are laid by females that survive the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The White Admiral_ (_Limenitis Sibylla_)\r\n\r\nThe White Admiral (Plate IV, fig. 5) is neither so pretty nor so common\r\nas its red namesake, but it is nevertheless a fine insect, although the\r\nchief beauty is reserved for the under surface. Above, the ground colour\r\nis a very dark rusty brown, relieved by bands and spots of white. The\r\nunder surface is beautifully marked with silvery blue, bright orange\r\nbrown, and white, the latter being arranged just like the corresponding\r\ncolour on the upper side.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this butterfly does not belong to the _Vanessa_\r\ngenus; so, while we may look for _family_ resemblances, we shall observe\r\na few features in which it differs from the preceding species.\r\n\r\nIt is not by any means abundant, being unknown in Scotland and Ireland,\r\nand confined in England almost exclusively to the oak woods of the\r\nsouth, where its food plant--the honeysuckle (_Lonicera\r\nPericlymenum_)--abounds. Here it may be seen during July, gracefully\r\nsailing among the trees and across the open spaces.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very different from those of the Vanessas. Its colour\r\nis dark green, with a narrow white stripe along each side. There are\r\nvery conspicuous branched spines on the third and two following\r\nsegments, also on the eleventh and twelfth; and smaller spines on most\r\nof the others. All the spines are of a brownish colour, with pink tips.\r\nWhile it is yet very small it prepares its winter quarters by bending\r\nround the remains of a leaf on which it has been feeding, securing the\r\nedges by silken threads, and then binding it to the stem of the plant.\r\nSoon after, the petiole becomes detached from the stem, and the little\r\ncaterpillar then rests suspended in its snug swinging cradle, where it\r\nremains perfectly secure till the following April, when the warm sun\r\ncalls it out to feed on the opening leaves. It continues at this till\r\nabout the beginning of June, and then changes to a beautiful angular and\r\neared chrysalis, of a bright green colour, marked with brown, and having\r\nbrilliant silvery spots and streaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--APATURIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Purple Emperor_ (_Apatura Iris_)\r\n\r\nThis grand insect is the only British member of its family, and richly\r\ndeserves its popular title. The male, which is figured on Plate V (fig.\r\n1), exhibits a most gorgeous imperial purple, which is reflected at\r\ncertain angles only from the upper surface of his large and powerful\r\nwings. His flight is lofty and vigorous, and among the topmost branches\r\nof majestic oaks, where he defies the efforts of would-be capturers.\r\nUnlike our other butterflies, he is also a very quarrelsome creature,\r\nand will not hesitate to fiercely attack a brother Emperor who dares\r\napproach the branch he has selected for his throne.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to capture this prized creature by means of\r\na large net mounted on the end of a pole twenty or thirty feet in\r\nlength, but the wielding of such a cumbersome implement against so\r\npowerful an insect is no mean task, and but few fall a prey to such a\r\nsnare. But it so happens that this imperial personage has a very\r\ndepraved appetite, the indulgence in which has often brought him to\r\nruin. Instead of searching out the sweets so bounteously supplied by the\r\nblossoms that are so attractive to other lepidopterous insects, he\r\ndelights in sipping the waters of the filthiest puddles, and imbibing\r\nthe odoriferous moisture of dung and the decomposing carcases of\r\nanimals. So deeply seated is this depravity of taste that the Emperor\r\nmay be netted with ease while indulging in his sumptuous feast, and is\r\neven to be taken at times with the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of this peculiarity of the imperial palate has led\r\nentomologists to abandon the awkward net, and to bait the woods with\r\nviands that alone can entice his highness from his lofty seat; and many\r\na splendid specimen has been easily captured while enjoying the\r\nluxurious juice of a dead cat, stoat, or rabbit, or of a seething mass\r\nof pig's dung.\r\n\r\nThe female is larger than her mate, and does not display the beautiful\r\npurple reflections that adorn the male. She is very different, too, in\r\nher habits, for she sits nearly all day on high branches of trees,\r\ngiving her attention to the graver duties of an imperial mother, and is\r\nconsequently but seldom seem. She lays her eggs in July on the sallow\r\n(_Salix Caprea_) or the poplar (_Populus_), and in less than a fortnight\r\nthe young caterpillars are hatched. They feed on till the leaves are\r\nfalling, and then fix themselves by their claspers to a silken carpet\r\nwhich they construct on a twig. Here they remain, exposed to all the\r\nwintry blasts and frosts, till the new leaves are out in the spring,\r\nwhen they again commence feeding, and continue to do so till they are\r\nfull grown--in May or June.\r\n\r\nThe under side of this species is shown in fig. 76, in which will also\r\nbe observed the eye-like spots of the fore wings which have given rise\r\nto its specific name (_Iris_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar (Plate VIII, fig. 5) is a very peculiar creature. Its\r\nbody is green, with seven oblique yellowish stripes on each side, and it\r\nhas a pair of horns attached to its head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--THE PURPLE EMPEROR--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis (Plate VIII, fig. 10) may be found in June, suspended to\r\nthe under side of a leaf. It is of an apple-green colour, and still\r\nexhibits the oblique stripes which we observed in the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis insect is not to be found in either Scotland or Ireland, but is\r\nmore or less abundant in many of the oak woods of the midland and\r\nsouthern counties of England. Among the numerous favoured localities, we\r\nmay mention Colchester, Forest of Dean, Northamptonshire, Ipswich,\r\nHuntingdonshire, Buckinghamshire, Epping, Lyndhurst, and the Isle of\r\nWight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_THE BROWNS AND HEATHS_\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--SATYRIDAE\r\n\r\nThis family contains eleven British species, often spoken of\r\ncollectively as the 'Browns,' since in most of them the prevailing tints\r\nare various shades of brown. They are decidedly dingy in comparison with\r\nthe beautiful butterflies we have been previously observing; but to this\r\nstatement we must allow one marked exception, for the family includes\r\nthe beautiful Marbled White, which stands out prominently among its\r\nfellows for brilliancy and boldness of colour.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the 'Satyrs' have no spines, but their bodies are\r\ncovered with very minute hair-bearing warts that give them a soft\r\nvelvety appearance. The hinder extremity tapers off considerably, and\r\nterminates in two points.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalides are not angular like those of the preceding species, and\r\nthough generally suspended by the tail, are sometimes found quite free\r\namong leaves and grasses on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects are rather feeble fliers, and generally take so\r\nlittle notice of intruders that they are easily caught in the hand.\r\nTheir wings are devoid of angles, and they have only four perfectly\r\ndeveloped legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marbled White_ (_Melanargia Galatea_)\r\n\r\nOur first member of this family is the exception to which we have\r\nalready alluded as a relief to the general dinginess of the 'Browns.'\r\nIts colours above are cream and black, arranged as shown in Plate V,\r\nfig. 2. The under side (fig. 77) is marked with white, black, and\r\ngreenish grey, with a row of eye-like spots parallel with the hind\r\nmargin of the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is not known in Scotland or Ireland, nor is it to be\r\nfound in several of the northern counties of England. Its chief haunts\r\nare the waste cliffy grounds of the southern and some of the midland\r\ncounties of England, where it is usually restricted to certain small\r\ndistricts. In some places it is really a common insect, and among these\r\nmay be mentioned Brighton, Horsham, Dover, Folkestone, Margate,\r\nGravesend, New Forest, parts of Gloucestershire, Cambridgeshire, and\r\nDevonshire, also in the Isle of Wight and South Wales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--THE MARBLED WHITE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is out in July, during which month the eggs are\r\ndeposited on various grasses, or indiscriminately on leaves and stems in\r\ngrassy spots.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on grasses; and, being still small at the end of\r\nthe autumn, hybernates during the winter among the stems of grass. It\r\nfeeds again in April, and is fully grown by the end of May. Its colour\r\nis a dull green or brownish, with a darker stripe down the back, and\r\nlighter stripes along the sides. Its spiracles are black.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is pale brown, marked with lines of a slightly darker\r\nshade. It may be found among grass stems, without any attachment, during\r\nthe month of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Ringlet_ (_Erebia Epiphron_)\r\n\r\nOn account of the very limited range of this butterfly, only those who\r\nhave the opportunity of visiting its haunts can have any practical\r\nacquaintance with its natural history. It is almost exclusively confined\r\nto the lake district in England, to a few mountainous localities in\r\nScotland, and to one or two similar localities in Ireland. Its strong\r\npartiality for elevated situations has earned for it the popular name of\r\nMountain Ringlet.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the upper surface (Plate V, fig. 3) is a dark brown, with\r\na broad band of rusty brown, parallel with the hind margin of each wing,\r\nand broken by the wing rays. Each division of these bands has often a\r\nblack central spot, but frequently these are entirely absent. The\r\ncolouring of the under side is very similar but less defined, and the\r\nrusty spots of the hind wings are very small.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly is out in June and July. The caterpillars, which are\r\ngreen, with white stripes along the sides, feed on various grasses. They\r\nhybernate during the winter, and change to the chrysalis state in the\r\nfollowing May or June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Northern Brown_ (_Erebia AEthiops_)\r\n\r\nThe colour of this species (Plate V, fig. 4) is a rich dark brown, with\r\nrust-coloured and black spotted bands arranged something like those of\r\nthe last. The markings, however, are very variable. There are usually\r\nfour black spots on the band of the fore wings, but the first two of\r\nthese are always united, and centred with white. The third is often very\r\nsmall or entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nThe under side of the fore wings is marked something like the upper, but\r\nthe hind wings on this side are grey, with two broad bands of a darker\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nAs its popular name implies, this butterfly is a northerner. It is\r\ncommon in Scotland, where it flies in elevated spots. In England it is\r\nconfined to the mountainous districts of the north.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is at large in July and August, during which time the\r\neggs are deposited on various grasses or on low-growing herbage in\r\ngrassy spots.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a brown colour, and has a narrow black stripe down\r\nthe middle of the back, and two other stripes, lighter than the ground\r\ncolour, one on each side. At about the end of June it turns to a\r\nchrysalis of a brownish colour.\r\n\r\nThe food plants of this species include a number of common grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Speckled Wood or Wood Argus_ (_Pararge Egeria_)\r\n\r\nMost of our butterflies delight in the hot sun, and are to be seen on\r\nthe wing only when it is shining brightly. This fact is particularly\r\nnoticeable on a bright day with occasional heavy clouds. While the sun's\r\nrays are pouring uninterruptedly on the landscape, numbers of these\r\nlight-lovers are to be observed flitting about; but when the dense\r\nshadow of a passing cloud creeps over the ground they rapidly disappear\r\nfrom view, having settled down to rest on leaves and stems. Then, as\r\nsoon as the shadow passes away, the air is again enlivened with their\r\nsports and flittings.\r\n\r\nThe Wood Argus is a marked exception to this rule. It delights in the\r\ncool shade of the narrow paths of woods, where it slowly flies up and\r\ndown the lonely footpath, taking but little heed of strangers that\r\nintrude on its haunts, and seldom venturing into the full blaze of the\r\nsun unless pursued. Even on dull days it continues its solitary flight,\r\nand may even be seen on the wing while a soft rain is bathing the\r\ndripping foliage.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of this pretty butterfly is shown on Plate V, fig. 5,\r\nand the under side in the accompanying woodcut. Both sides are prettily\r\nmarked with various shades of brown and buff, and adorned with\r\nwhite-centred dark eye-spots which have earned for it the name of Argus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--THE WOOD ARGUS--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nIt first appears on the wing in April, and may be seen from this month\r\ncontinuously to the end of August.\r\n\r\nThe food plants probably consist of many species of grasses, the\r\ncock's-foot (_Dactylis glomerata_) and couch grass (_Agropyron repens_)\r\nbeing among the number, and the eggs are laid on or in the neighbourhood\r\nof these during the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species is of a dull greenish or brownish\r\ncolour, and it has two whitish stripes (sometimes three) down the middle\r\nof the back, and similar stripes along each side. It hybernates during\r\nthe winter, and is full grown in March, when it changes to a dull green\r\nor brownish chrysalis, which is streaked with black, and has a few white\r\ndots on the back.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the butterfly is on the wing from April to\r\nAugust, and, according to some authorities, there are no less than three\r\nbroods during this time, following each other in rapid succession. It is\r\ncommon throughout England and Ireland, and is known in parts of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wall Butterfly_ (_Pararge Megaera_)\r\n\r\nBelonging to the same genus is another very familiar butterfly--the\r\nWall--which receives its popular title from its peculiar habit of\r\nfrequently resting on walls and stony banks. It is one of the first, if\r\nnot _the_ first, to take to the wing in the morning, and is generally\r\nthe last to seek its hiding place in the evening. I have seen it\r\nactively flying about during August, as early as 7.30 in the morning,\r\nand found it still flitting from one spot to another along the western\r\nside of a wall as late as 8 in the evening, as if in search of a\r\nconvenient shelter for the fast approaching night.\r\n\r\nThis pretty 'Brown' must be familiar to the reader, and the coloured\r\ndrawing on Plate V (fig. 6) will at once serve for purposes of\r\nidentification without the necessity of a wordy description. It may be\r\nmentioned, however, that the male (the sex figured) is smaller than the\r\nfemale, and is further distinguished by a broad dark oblique band\r\npassing across each fore wing.\r\n\r\nThe Wall is a double-brooded butterfly, the first brood appearing in\r\nMay, and the second in August. The caterpillars which produce the latter\r\nmay be found on the cock's foot (_Dactylis glomerata_) and other grasses\r\nin June, while those of the former are hybernators; and the chrysalides\r\nof the two broods may be found in April and July respectively.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is green, with a slightly darker stripe\r\ndown the middle of the back, a pale stripe along each side, and another\r\nsimilar stripe about midway between these two.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is green with the exception of the more prominent parts of\r\nits surface, which are almost white.\r\n\r\nThis species is very common in almost every locality in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grayling_ (_Satyrus Semele_)\r\n\r\nThe Grayling is the largest of our 'Browns,' and, although a powerful\r\nflier, it seldom takes long flights. The female, which is shown in fig.\r\n7, Plate V, is really a beautiful creature, the light markings of which\r\nstand out in bold contrast with the deep brown ground colour; but the\r\nmale is comparatively dingy, there being much less contrast between the\r\nground and the markings. He is also smaller than his mate.\r\n\r\nThe under side of both sexes is similar (fig. 79), the pattern of the\r\nfore wings being much like that of the other side, but considerably\r\nlighter, and the hind wings are beautifully marbled with various greys\r\nand browns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--THE GRAYLING--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis species is not nearly so common as the two preceding, but it is\r\nvery widely distributed, and is exceedingly abundant in some parts. On\r\nsome of the heathery cliffs and downs of the south and south-west coasts\r\nit is so plentiful that the butterflies are started into the air at\r\nalmost every step, for it seldom flies except when disturbed. It is a\r\ncommon insect in Ireland, and also in parts of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is a hybernator, and may be found feeding on grasses in\r\nthe autumn and the spring. It changes to the chrysalis in June, and the\r\nperfect insect is on the wing from June to the beginning of September.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is pinkish drab above, and greenish drab\r\nbeneath. A dark brown stripe, edged with a lighter colour, passes down\r\nthe middle of the back, and a dark line on each side. It changes to a\r\ndark reddish-brown chrysalis on the surface of the ground, or, according\r\nto some observers, a little beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Meadow Brown_ (_Epinephele Janira_)\r\n\r\nAlthough this very common butterfly is usually considered to be the\r\ndingiest of its family, yet it must be admitted that the colour of a\r\nfreshly emerged specimen is really very rich.\r\n\r\nThe male is of a dark brown colour, with an indistinct patch of a\r\nlighter tawny brown near the outer margin of the fore wings, and a\r\nwhite-centred black eye-spot near the costal angle of the same wings.\r\nThe female (Plate V, fig. 8) is of a lighter colour, the eye-spot on her\r\nfore wings is larger and far more conspicuous, and an irregular patch of\r\nlight orange brown occupies a large area of each of the same wings. She\r\nis, moreover, larger than her mate, and in every way a more attractive\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nThe Meadow Brown abounds everywhere, from June to September, and may be\r\nseen on grass land and waste grounds where other butterflies are seldom\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, and is rendered slightly rough by a number of\r\nminute warts. There is also a white stripe on each side. It feeds on\r\nvarious grasses in the autumn, hybernates during the winter, and is full\r\ngrown in May.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is apple green, spotted with a lighter green, and has\r\nseveral black markings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Heath_ (_Epinephele Tithonus_)\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is sometimes called the 'Small Meadow Brown,' and is\r\ncertainly much like the last species, both in colouring and habits.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the male (Plate V, fig. 9) are light orange brown,\r\nbordered with dark brown, and having a broad patch of the same across\r\nthe middle; and near the costal angle is a round black spot with two\r\nwhite dots. The hind wings are dark brown with a patch of light orange\r\nbrown near the centre, and a small eye-spot near the anal angle. The\r\nfemale is exactly similar, except that she does not possess the broad\r\nbar on the fore wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--THE LARGE HEATH--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe under side is shown in fig. 80, and is coloured with various shades\r\nof brown.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common butterfly, and may be seen during July in most\r\nEnglish counties, also in the south of Scotland, and in a few localities\r\nin the south of Ireland. It frequents meadows, heaths, downs, and lanes,\r\nlike _Janira_, but is not nearly so abundant as that species.\r\n\r\nThe young caterpillar is hatched in August, and is still very small when\r\nit seeks its winter shelter among the stems of grasses. It resumes\r\nfeeding in the following May, and is full grown towards the end of June.\r\nIts colour is very variable--pale green, olive green, or dull brown,\r\nwith five longitudinal stripes at about equal distances from each other.\r\nThese consist of a dark one down the middle of the back, a pale line\r\nalong each side, and another pale line midway between these.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis may be found at the end of June, attached by the tail to\r\nblades of grass. It is of a very light colour, almost white, but adorned\r\nwith numerous black lines and patches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ringlet_ (_Epinephele Hyperanthus_)\r\n\r\nThis is another rather plainly dressed insect, though somewhat prettily\r\nadorned on the under side. The upper surface is of a very deep sepia\r\nbrown, almost black, with a few indistinct black eye-like spots near the\r\nmargins. The under side (Plate V, fig. 10) is of a lighter umber brown,\r\nwith corresponding eye-spots generally very conspicuous. These spots are\r\nblack, with white centres, and generally surrounded by light rings. They\r\nare subject, however, to considerable variation. Those on the upper\r\nsurface are sometimes quite absent in the male, but are nearly always\r\nreadily perceptible in the female. On the under side, too, they are\r\noccasionally quite absent, while in other varieties they are minute\r\nwhite-centred dots, without any surrounding light ring. Our coloured\r\ndrawing represents the most usual form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--THE RINGLET--UPPER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe favourite haunts of the Ringlet are the borders of woods, and the\r\nsheltered sides of flowery hedgerows. It is not so widely distributed as\r\nsome of the common 'Browns,' but is usually very abundant where it\r\noccurs, sometimes appearing in such numbers that several may be taken\r\nwith a single stroke of the net. It does not seem to be a frequenter of\r\nScotland, and is known in Ireland only in the south. Its head quarters\r\nare the southern and south-midland counties of England.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid in July on various grasses, on which the young\r\ncaterpillars feed from about the middle of August till the cold weather\r\nsets in. They hybernate at the roots of the grasses till the beginning\r\nof the following May, and change to the chrysalis state about the middle\r\nof June, suspending themselves to grass blades by means of their anal\r\nhooks.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is dull green or brown, and is marked with\r\nfive longitudinal stripes much like those of the Large Heath.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is pale brown, spotted and striped with a darker shade of\r\nthe same colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marsh Ringlet_ (_Caenonympha Typhon_)\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of this butterfly is shown in the first figure of\r\nPlate VI, and the under side in the accompanying woodcut; but it must be\r\nremembered that the species is a very variable one, so much so that it\r\nis almost impossible to give anything like a short and, at the same\r\ntime, a satisfactory description. The female may usually be\r\ndistinguished by a pale patch across the middle of the fore wings; and\r\nthe eye spots of the same wings, always more or less indistinct when\r\npresent, are sometimes entirely wanting. The markings of the under side\r\nare even more variable, the transverse bars and the eye spots being\r\noften particularly conspicuous, and at other times hardly discernible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--THE MARSH RINGLET--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis is generally spoken of as a northerner, its chief localities being\r\nin the mountainous parts of Scotland and the elevated districts of the\r\nnorth of England, but in Ireland it extends to the southern ranges. Its\r\nhaunts are elevated moors and marshy heaths, where its food plant--the\r\nbeak-rush (_Rhyncospora alba_)--abounds, and it is on the wing from the\r\nend of June to August or September.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with five longitudinal stripes--one dark one,\r\nbordered with yellow, down the middle of the back, and two pale yellow\r\nones on each side. It is a hybernator, and is full grown about the end\r\nof May, when it suspends itself by the hindmost claspers to a silken\r\ncarpet, and changes to a green chrysalis with pale brown wing cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Heath_ (_Caenonympha Pamphilus_)\r\n\r\nThe last member of the family _Satyridae_ is the well-known Small Heath,\r\nthat may be seen almost all over the British Isles on heaths, meadows\r\nand moors, from May to September.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of this butterfly (Plate VI, fig. 2) is a tawny\r\nyellow, with a dark brown border, and a spot of the same dark tint near\r\nthe tip of each fore wing. The under side is much like that of the last\r\nspecies, but there are no eye spots on the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the first brood are laid during May and June on the various\r\ngrasses on which the caterpillar feeds.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars that emerge from these are fully grown in July or early\r\nAugust, and go through their changes during the latter month; but the\r\nlater ones hybernate during the winter, and are not full fed till the\r\nfollowing May.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the larva is pale apple green, with a wide darker stripe\r\ndown the back, two others along the sides, and two more between the\r\nlatter and the dorsal stripe. All these five stripes are bordered with a\r\nwhitish colour.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is bright apple green, dotted with white, and the wing\r\ncases are striped with a purple-brown line edged with white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_THE HAIRSTREAKS, COPPERS AND BLUES_\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--LYCAENIDAE\r\n\r\nThis is a large family, including as it does no less than nineteen of\r\nthe British species. These are all of small size, and are characterised\r\nby their short and jerky flights. They seldom rise much above the\r\nground, and are consequently very easily caught.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this family have all short and rather thick bodies,\r\nshaped very much like that of the wood louse--flattened beneath and very\r\nconvex above.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalides are generally attached by the 'tail,' and further\r\nsecured by a silken cord round the body, as we have already observed in\r\nthe case of the _Pieridae_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects differ from the preceding species in that all six\r\nlegs are perfectly developed and adapted for walking.\r\n\r\nThere are only three genera in this large family:\r\n\r\n  1. _Thecla_--The Hairstreaks, with 'tailed' wings.\r\n  2. _Polyommatus_--The 'Coppers.'\r\n  3. _Lycaena_--The 'Blues,' with wings either blue or brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brown Hairstreak_ (_Thecla Betulae_)\r\n\r\nThe five Hairstreaks which constitute the genus _Thecla_ are all pretty\r\ninsects, characterised by hair-like streaks on the under surface.\r\n\r\n_Betulae_ is the largest of these. Its upper surface is of a deep brown\r\ncolour, with orange-brown marks at the anal angles of the hind wings,\r\nand, in the female, a large patch of orange on the fore wings. The under\r\nside (Plate VI, fig. 3) is orange brown, much lighter in the male than\r\nin the female. On the fore wings are two white lines, the inner one of\r\nwhich is indistinct; and on the hind wings are two others, the outer one\r\nbeing longer and more distinct than the inner.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is by no means an abundant insect, though it is widely\r\ndistributed, and in some places plentiful. Its chief haunts are woods,\r\nand we may mention among its favoured localities Epping Forest, Monk's\r\nWood in Cambridgeshire, the wooded parts of South Devon and Dorset, New\r\nForest, Colchester, and Peterborough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--THE BROWN HAIRSTREAK--MALE.]\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is on the wing from July to October, and the eggs are\r\ndeposited in the autumn on the twigs of its food plant--the blackthorn\r\n(_Prunus spinosa_). These do not hatch till the following spring. Toward\r\nthe end of June the caterpillar is fully fed.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is light green, with two white stripes\r\ndown the back, and two others along the sides. There are also two small\r\noblique whitish lines on each side of each segment.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is smooth, and of a pale brown colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Black Hairstreak, or White-letter Hairstreak_ (_Thecla W-album_)\r\n\r\nThe first of the above two popular names has been applied to this\r\nspecies on account of the very deep brown colour of the upper side,\r\nwhich colour is often a near approach to black. The second is due to the\r\nW-shaped bend of the white streak of the hind wings. The ground colour\r\nof the under side (Plate VI, fig. 4) is greyish brown, with a bright\r\norange band, spotted with black near the hind margin of the hind wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--THE WHITE-LETTER HAIRSTREAK.]\r\n\r\n_W-album_ is a somewhat rare insect, but is occasionally seen in plenty\r\nin a few localities, Cambridgeshire, Berkshire, Epping, Colchester and\r\nSuffolk being among its chief resorts. It is out on the wing in July,\r\nand should be looked for in wooded country where the common elm (_Ulmus\r\ncampestris_) and the wych elm (_U. montana_), its food plants, exist.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid on the twigs of these trees late in the summer, and\r\nthe young caterpillars do not appear till the following spring. The\r\nchrysalis may be found attached to an elm twig or leaf about the end of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green. The ridges along the back are tinged with\r\nyellow, and there are two fine oblique white lines on each side of each\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dark Hairstreak_ (_Thecla Pruni_)\r\n\r\nThe upper side of this butterfly is very much like that of _W-album_,\r\nbut it may be distinguished by the presence of a few orange spots near\r\nthe anal angle of the hind wings. The colouring of the under side (Plate\r\nVI, fig. 5) is also very similar, except that the white lines of the\r\nwings are thinner and less distinct than in the last species, and do not\r\nexhibit the W-shaped bend. The orange band of this surface is bordered\r\non each side with a row of black spots, each of which is touched with a\r\nbluish white or a metallic blue.\r\n\r\nThis insect is not by any means common, but has been seen in\r\nconsiderable numbers in certain localities. It is not found in either\r\nScotland or Ireland, and its chief haunts in England seem to be in\r\nHuntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. It frequents\r\nwooded country, and flies during June and July.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid late in the summer on the twigs of the blackthorn\r\n(_Prunus spinosa_), and are not hatched till the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, which is pale green, with rows of yellow spots, may be\r\nfound in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Purple Hairstreak_ (_Thecla Quercus_)\r\n\r\nThis pretty butterfly, by far the commonest of the Hairstreaks, though\r\ncomparatively very small, reminds one forcibly of the noble Purple\r\nEmperor. Its haunts are the same oak woods, and its upper surface,\r\nthough only a dull dark brown in certain lights, exhibits the same\r\nimperial purple reflections when viewed at certain angles. The purple of\r\nthe male extends over the whole of the wings, but that of the female is\r\nconfined to a V-shaped patch at the base of the fore wings. In the\r\nlatter case, however, the purple is much richer than in the male sex.\r\n\r\nThe under side (Plate VI, fig. 6) is coloured with a delicate grey\r\nground, adorned with a white streak on each wing, and a couple of orange\r\nspots near the anal angle of the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThis species is very widely distributed, being common in oak woods in\r\nmost parts of England, and also in many parts of Scotland and Ireland.\r\nIt flies around the branches of the trees, and often disappoints the\r\ncollector by keeping far beyond the reach of his net.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--THE PURPLE HAIRSTREAK--MALE.]\r\n\r\nThose in search of this pretty insect should ramble in oak woods,\r\npreferably in the south of England, during July and August. The eggs may\r\nbe found glued to the twigs throughout the winter, and the larvae may be\r\nbeaten from the branches of the oak in June.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is brownish or pinkish green, with a row\r\nof V-shaped marks down the back.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is of a brown colour, short and thick, and may be found\r\neither attached to oak leaves, or under the surface of the earth at the\r\nfoot of the tree on which the caterpillar fed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Green Hairstreak_ (_Thecla Rubi_)\r\n\r\nNext to _Quercus_, this is the most plentiful of the genus. It frequents\r\nwoods and heaths in nearly every county in England, and is also found in\r\nparts of Scotland and Ireland. It is peculiar among British butterflies\r\nas being the only one that exhibits a bright green colour. It also\r\ndiffers from the other Hairstreaks in two important particulars, for the\r\nhind wings, though angled at the hind margin, are not 'tailed,' and the\r\ncharacteristic hairstreak which gives the popular name to the genus is\r\nhere represented only by a series of white dots across the wings, or, in\r\nsome cases, by one or two dots on the hind wings only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--THE GREEN HAIRSTREAK.]\r\n\r\nThe upper side is dark brown, displaying metallic reflections when\r\nviewed in a strong light. The under side is represented in fig. 7 of\r\nPlate VI.\r\n\r\nThe chief food plants of this species are the bramble (_Rubus\r\nfruticosus_), the birch (_Betula alba_), and the broom (_Cytisus\r\nscoparius_).\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect flies in May and June, and the eggs are deposited\r\nduring the latter month on the above plants. The caterpillars are full\r\nfed in July, and change to the chrysalis state towards the end of the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is pale green, with a yellow stripe and\r\nseveral white oblique lines along the sides, also a yellowish stripe\r\ndown the back.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is short and thick, and of a dark brown colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Copper_ (_Polyommatus Dispar_)\r\n\r\nOur next genus contains only two British species. The first of\r\nthese--the Large Copper--was once a common insect at Whittlesea in\r\nCambridgeshire, and in some of the fens of Huntingdonshire, but is now\r\nfeared to be quite extinct, as none have been seen for many years. The\r\nlast capture was made in 1847 in Huntingdonshire. However, it _may_ turn\r\nup again; and even if it does not, it would be a pity to allow the\r\nmemory of so fine an insect to die out; so we find room to figure it\r\n(Plate VI, fig. 8), and append a few remarks.\r\n\r\nThere is a very great difference between the male and the female. The\r\nformer is of a brilliant copper hue, and all the wings have a black\r\nmargin and a black streak near the middle. The female is larger; and the\r\ncoppery colour is much redder. The black border of the fore wings is\r\nwider, and there are also several large black spots on these wings. The\r\nhind wings are almost entirely covered with black, with the exception of\r\na broad coppery band near the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThe food plant of the caterpillar appears to have been the water dock\r\n(_Rumex Hydrolapathum_), on which the eggs were laid late in the summer.\r\nIt is probable that the caterpillar was a hybernator, seeking its winter\r\nshelter while still very young; and it was full fed in June.\r\n\r\nIts colour was green, with a darker stripe of the same colour on the\r\nback; and the chrysalis was attached by anal hooks and a cord round the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Copper_ (_Polyommatus Phlaeas_)\r\n\r\nThe only other British member of the genus _Polyommatus_--the Small\r\nCopper--is one of the commonest of our butterflies. It may be found in\r\nnearly all parts of the British Isles from April to September, more\r\nparticularly in April, June, _and_ August, for it is apparently triple\r\nbrooded.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant and lively little insect is shown on Plate VI (fig. 9),\r\nand, being so very familiar, needs no description.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on different species of dock--the broad-leaved\r\ndock (_Rumex obtusifolius_), the fiddle dock (_R. pulcher_), the sorrel\r\n(_R. acetosa_), and the sheep sorrel (_R. acetosella_); also on the\r\nragwort (_Senecio Jacobaea_). It is full fed about three weeks after\r\nhatching, and then changes to a small and stout chrysalis, of a pale\r\nbrown colour, on the leaf of its food plant.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar itself is green, with a reddish line on the back and on\r\neach side; and it glides over the surface of the leaves something after\r\nthe manner of a slug, without exhibiting any very apparent motion of its\r\nshort legs and claspers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tailed Blue_ (_Lycaena Baetica_)\r\n\r\nWe now come to a genus containing no less than ten species of beautiful\r\nlittle butterflies, known commonly as the 'Blues;' but one of them\r\nexhibits no trace of the colour so characteristic of the group, although\r\nit resembles the others in structure and habits.\r\n\r\nOur first example is the Tailed Blue, known also as the Pea-pod Argus.\r\nThe upper side of this insect (Plate VI, fig. 10) is of a dull smoke\r\ncolour, exhibiting purple-blue reflections, which are, in the female,\r\nconfined to distinct blotches on the bases of the wings, but in the male\r\nare less noticeable, and extend over the whole surface. The hind margin\r\nof the hind wings has a row of spots, more or less distinct, and much\r\nmore prominent in the female than in the male. The under side is\r\nbeautifully marked with bands of fawn and grey, and with two spots of\r\nbrilliant metallic green in the anal angle of the hind wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--THE TAILED BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis butterfly abounds in the countries of South Europe, where the\r\ncaterpillar feeds on the pods of certain leguminous plants; but only a\r\nfew stragglers have been taken in England, so that its reputation as a\r\ntrue Britisher is very uncertain. It is highly probable that the two or\r\nthree specimens caught on our south coast were blown over from the\r\nContinent, and that the insect has never bred on this side of the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Silver-studded Blue_ (_Lycaena AEgon_)\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the male (Plate VI, fig. 11) of this species is\r\npurple blue, with a black border on the hind margins of all wings. The\r\nfemale (fig. 12 of the same plate) is of a very dark smoky-brown colour,\r\noften with a bluish tinge, and has generally a row of orange spots near\r\nthe hind margin of the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThe under side of both sexes is similar, and is illustrated in the\r\naccompanying woodcut. The ground colour is bluish grey, and is marked\r\nwith a number of black spots surrounded by light rings. Along the hind\r\nmargin of the hind wings is a row of orange spots, each bordered with\r\nblack on the inner side, and with a silvery blue on the outer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88. THE SILVER-STUDDED BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis insect appears in July, and is common in many dry, sandy, or chalky\r\nspots in various parts of England, and also in a few localities in\r\nScotland and Ireland. It has been reported as abundant at Darlington and\r\nin certain localities in Lancashire, but its head quarters are\r\nundoubtedly the chalk downs and dry gravelly banks of the southern\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the bird's-foot (_Ornithopus perpusillus_), and\r\nis full grown towards the end of June. Its colour is yellow or grey,\r\nwith a brown dorsal stripe, a white line on each side, and pale oblique\r\nlines near the former. About the end of June it changes to a dull green\r\nchrysalis, with projecting wing cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brown Argus_ (_Lycaena Astrarche_)\r\n\r\nNeither male nor female of this species exhibits any trace of blue. The\r\nupper surface, shown in fig. 13 of Plate VI, is coloured with a warm\r\nbrown, and all four wings have a row of orange spots near the hind\r\nmargin. The fore wings have also a central black spot. The under\r\nsurface, drawn on the same plate (fig. 14), is bluish grey, with a\r\nborder of orange spots on each hind margin as on the other side. There\r\nare also numerous black spots in light rings, the arrangement of which\r\nwill be seen in the figure.\r\n\r\nSome species of butterflies and moths are so variable in their colouring\r\nand markings that varieties have often been mistaken for distinct\r\nspecies; and, in other cases, distinct species are sometimes so similar\r\nin character that they are looked upon as identical.\r\n\r\nA butterfly that closely resembles the normal Brown Argus in many\r\npoints, and named _Artaxerxes_, has often been described as a distinct\r\nspecies, but is now, I believe, recognised by most entomologists as a\r\nconstant variety of the present species.\r\n\r\nIt differs from the normal type in having a _white_ instead of a _black_\r\nspot in the centre of the fore wings, and the border of orange spots is\r\noften very indistinct. On the under side, too, instead of black spots in\r\nwhite rings, it has white spots, with little or no trace of a black\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Brown Argus is a southerner, and is particularly abundant\r\non the chalk downs of the south coast and the Isle of Wight, but\r\n_Artaxerxes_ is to be found only in Scotland and the north of England;\r\nand it is interesting to note that, between these northern and southern\r\ndistricts, intermediate varieties are to be met with.\r\n\r\nAgain, _Astrarche_ is a double-brooded butterfly, appearing on the wing\r\nin May and August; while _Artaxerxes_ is single brooded, flying at\r\nmidsummer. This fact has lent support to the opinion that the two are\r\ndistinct species; but it must be remembered that several insects that\r\nare single brooded in one country are double brooded in a warmer\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of _Astrarche_ feeds on the hemlock stork's-bill\r\n(_Erodium cicutarium_). It is of a pale yellow colour, with a brownish\r\nline on the back; and is full fed in April and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Blue_ (_Lycaena Icarus_)\r\n\r\nAlthough this pretty little butterfly is so common that it is almost\r\nsure to be known to all who take any interest in insect life, yet it is\r\nimportant to observe it carefully, since it is an easy matter to\r\nconfound it with other species of the same genus.\r\n\r\nThe upper surfaces of the two sexes are very different, that of the male\r\n(Plate VI, fig. 15) being a beautiful lilac blue; and that of the\r\nfemale (Plate VI, fig. 16) a dark brown, powdered with blue at the bases\r\nof the wings, and having _generally_ a border of orange spots, more or\r\nless defined, on the hind margins of all wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--THE COMMON BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe under side, shown in the accompanying woodcut, is ashy brown; warm\r\nin the female, but paler in the male. The hind wings, and sometimes all\r\nfour, are bordered with orange spots; and this species may be\r\ndistinguished from _Astrarche_ by the presence of two black spots, in\r\nwhite rings, near the base of the fore wings.\r\n\r\nThere will be no need to name localities for this insect, as it is\r\nabundant everywhere, frequenting meadows, heaths, and all waste places.\r\nIt is double brooded, and is on the wing continuously from May to\r\nSeptember, the first brood enduring from May to July, and the second\r\nfrom July to the end of the warm weather.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with a dorsal line of a darker tint, and a row\r\nof white spots on each side. It feeds on clover (_Trifolium pratense_\r\nand _T. repens_), bird's-foot (_Ornithopus perpusillus_), bird's-foot\r\ntrefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_), and the rest-harrow (_Ononis spinosa_).\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is short and rounded, of a dull green colour, tinged with\r\nbrown on the under surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Clifden Blue_ (_Lycaena Bellargus_)\r\n\r\nOur coloured representations of this beautiful blue (Plate VI, figs. 17\r\nand 18) show that here also there is a great difference between the male\r\nand female. The former is a most lovely and brilliant sky blue, bordered\r\nby a fine black line; and the latter is a dull dark brown, with a more\r\nor less distinct border of orange spots, and the bases of the wings are\r\npowdered with scales of a tint corresponding with those of the male. In\r\nboth sexes the fringe is very distinctly barred with dark brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--THE CLIFDEN BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe under side (fig. 90) is similar in both sexes--greyish brown, with\r\na border of reddish spots, and a number of black spots in white rings,\r\nthe arrangement of which is here represented.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly frequents chalky downs, chiefly in the south of England,\r\nand seems to be unknown in Scotland and Ireland. The Isle of Wight, and\r\nthe chalky downs and banks of Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, are its\r\nfavourite localities; and even in these it is generally very local,\r\nsometimes swarming on a grassy bank of no great extent, when the\r\nsurrounding neighbourhood, though apparently equally suitable to its\r\nrequirements, does not harbour a single specimen. It is on the wing in\r\nMay and June, and again in August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with two rows of yellow streaks on the back,\r\nand a yellow stripe on each side. It feeds on the Dutch clover\r\n(_Trifolium repens_), horse-shoe vetch (_Hippocrepis comosa_), and\r\nvarious other leguminous plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chalk-Hill Blue_ (_Lycaena Corydon_)\r\n\r\nThe male of this species (Plate VII, fig. 1) is readily to be\r\ndistinguished from all other members of the genus by its pale glossy\r\nblue, but the female (fig. 2 of Plate VII) so closely resembles that of\r\n_Bellargus_ that it is often a somewhat difficult matter to discriminate\r\nbetween them. The following, however, are a few points worthy of\r\nobservation: The upper side of the female _Corydon_ has the bases of the\r\nwings more or less sprinkled with the pale silky blue that characterises\r\nthe male; and the black bars of the fringe are _usually_ broader in\r\n_Corydon_ than in _Bellargus_. The black-centred spots of the under side\r\nare also usually more conspicuous in the former species than in the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--THE CHALK HILL BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of identification is increased by the fact that both\r\nthese butterflies frequent similar localities, and are often on the wing\r\nat the same time; but although _Corydon_ is certainly a frequenter of\r\nchalky districts, yet it is often found plentifully in districts far\r\nremoved from the chalk, notably at Arnside in Lancashire, and in Epping\r\nForest.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly is out in June and July. The caterpillar is green, with\r\ntwo rows of short yellow streaks on the back, and a yellow stripe on\r\neach side. It feeds on the purple and Dutch clovers (_Trifolium\r\npratense_ and _T. repens_), bird's-foot trefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_),\r\nhorse-shoe vetch (_Hippocrepis comosa_), and lady's fingers (_Anthyllis\r\nvulneraria_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Holly Blue_ (_Lycaena Argiolus_)\r\n\r\nWhile all the other Blues delight to sport on low flowery banks in the\r\nfull blaze of the summer's sun, the Holly Blue prefers to flit among the\r\nbranches of trees, often many feet from the ground. The larva feeds on\r\nthe flowers of the holly (_Ilex Aquifolium_) in the spring, and on those\r\nof the ivy (_Hedera Helix_) late in the summer; also on the alder\r\nbuckthorn (_Rhamnus Frangula_); and it is in localities where these grow\r\nthat we may find this lovely Blue sporting among the branches, or\r\nresting on a leaf with its wings folded together, thus making itself\r\nconspicuous among the dark foliage by exposing the pale silvery blue of\r\nits under surface.\r\n\r\nThe upper sides of both the male and female are shown on Plate VII\r\n(figs. 3 and 4 respectively), where the beautiful lilac blue will be\r\nseen to have a border of black, wider in the latter than in the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--THE HOLLY BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe under surface is spotted with black, as shown in fig. 92, and has no\r\nborder of orange spots.\r\n\r\nThis is a double-brooded butterfly, appearing first in April and May,\r\nand then again in August. It is not at all uncommon in the south of\r\nEngland, and extends northward as far as the Lake District, but is not\r\nfound in Scotland. It is generally distributed throughout Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar may be looked for in June and October. It is light\r\ngreen, with a line of dark green down the back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mazarine Blue_ (_Lycaena Semiargus_)\r\n\r\nThe male (Plate VII, fig. 5) is deep purple blue, with a narrow\r\ndark-brown border, and the female (fig. 6 of the same plate) dark brown.\r\nThe under side of both sexes is light greyish-brown or drab, with a row\r\nof black spots in white rings parallel with the hind margin of each\r\nwing, and no reddish or orange spots.\r\n\r\nThis pretty butterfly seems to have been plentiful in several localities\r\nsome years since, but has not been seen for a long time; and it is\r\nprobable that its reckless slaughter by those who catch all the pretty\r\nbutterflies they can secure either for ornament or for gain has caused\r\nits name to be permanently removed from our list of natives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--THE MAZARINE BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly abundant in Dorset, Hereford, Glamorganshire, and near\r\nShirley, and was on the wing in June and July, but it disappeared from\r\nour view before a full account of its life history had been prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Blue_ (_Lycaena Minima_)\r\n\r\nWe now come to the smallest of all British butterflies--a little insect\r\nthat measures less than one inch from tip to tip when its wings are\r\nexpanded. Its upper surface is of a dull and dark-brown colour, the\r\nbases of the wings being dusted with blue in the case of the male. The\r\nunder side is pale drab, tinged with greenish blue at the bases of the\r\nwings, and marked with black spots in light rings as shown in the\r\naccompanying figure. The upper side is represented in fig. 7 of Plate\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--THE SMALL BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is on the wing in May and June, and during the latter\r\nmonth the eggs are deposited on the flowers of the lady's fingers\r\n(_Anthyllis vulneraria_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are hatched in about a week, and commence feeding on\r\nthe calyx of the buds, and soon burrow into them till they are quite\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is brownish, with a darker stripe on the\r\nback, and a row of oblique brown streaks on each side.\r\n\r\nThis species is widely distributed in England, and is plentiful in most\r\nchalky and limestone districts. It is also found in parts of Scotland\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Blue_ (_Lycaena Arion_)\r\n\r\nThe last of our Blues is the largest of the genus, and is, with the\r\nexception of _Semiargus_, the rarest. It is a very local insect,\r\nappearing in small numbers, during June and July, in parts of South\r\nDevon, Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, and a few other counties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--THE LARGE BLUE--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe colour of the upper side is a dark and rich blue, with a broad dark\r\nborder on the hind margins, and a group of black spots near the centre\r\nof the fore wings. The under side (fig. 95) is of a pearly grey, without\r\nany red spots, but having a double border of black spots, and also an\r\nirregular row of black spots in white rings across the middle of each\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on thyme (_Thymus Serpyllum_), on which plant the\r\neggs are laid singly, generally on the flower heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND THE SKIPPERS_\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ERYCINIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Burgundy_ (_Nemeobius Lucina_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Erycinidae_ has only one British representative, commonly\r\nknown as the Duke of Burgundy Fritillary, but although this butterfly\r\ncertainly resembles the Fritillaries in general appearance (see figs. 9\r\nand 10 of Plate VII), its habits and life history present many points of\r\ndifference from these.\r\n\r\nThe upper side is chequered with black and tawny brown, the fringe is\r\nwhite and barred with dark brown, and a row of tawny spots with black\r\ncentres border the hind margins. The under side has two rows of white\r\nspots, one near the base, and the other across the centre of each wing.\r\n\r\nThe male has only four legs adapted for walking, but the female has six.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly is out in May and June, and frequents the paths and open\r\nspaces of woods, chiefly in the south of England, but it has been taken\r\nin some of the northern counties.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar (Plate VIII, fig. 6) is not spiny like those of the true\r\nFritillaries, but more closely resembles those of the Blues, being\r\nsomewhat of the form of a woodlouse. It is reddish brown, with tufts of\r\nhair, black spiracles, and a dark line down the back. It feeds on the\r\nprimrose (_Primula acaulis_) and the cowslip (_P. veris_), and may be\r\nfound during June, July and August.\r\n\r\nWhen fully grown, the caterpillar secures itself to a leaf or stem by\r\nmeans of its anal claspers and a silken cord round its body, and changes\r\nto a short, thick, hairy and light-coloured chrysalis (Plate VIII, fig.\r\n11), which is marked with several black spots. In this state it spends\r\nthe winter, and emerges early in the following summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--HESPERIIDAE--THE SKIPPERS\r\n\r\nThis family contains eight small species, none of which are remarkable\r\nfor brilliancy of color. They are, nevertheless, very interesting\r\ncreatures, for they exhibit peculiarities of structure and habit that\r\nrender them singular among the butterflies, and seem to show a sort of\r\ncousin relationship with the moths. They have thick bodies that remind\r\nus somewhat of the _Noctuae_. Their heads are broad, so that the antennae,\r\nwhich are slightly hooked at the tips, are rather wide apart at the\r\nbases. When at rest, they neither press their wings together over their\r\nback like the other butterflies, nor do they set them horizontally after\r\nthe manner of the moths, but seem to lay claim to an intermediate\r\nposition in the scale of Lepidopterous insects by holding them in a half\r\nelevated position. Their flight, too, is not graceful like that of most\r\nother butterflies, nor even so steady as that of the little flitting\r\nblues, but brisk and erratic, and resembling the fitful motions of moths\r\ndisturbed from their slumberings at unwonted hours. Thus they have\r\nearned their popular title of skippers from their habit of skipping\r\nrather than flying from flower to flower. All the three pairs of legs of\r\nthese butterflies are fully developed for walking.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars have rather large heads, and their bodies taper from\r\nthe middle toward both extremities. Like the larvae of many moths, they\r\nhide themselves in leaves which they have rolled and secured with silken\r\nthreads; and when about to change to the chrysalis state, they also spin\r\nsilken cocoons for their further protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grizzled Skipper_ (_Syrichthus Malvae_)\r\n\r\nThe ground color of this species is a very dark brown, relieved by a\r\nnumber of square white spots arranged as shown in fig. 11 of Plate VII.\r\nThe fringe is wide, and barred with the same two colours, arranged\r\nalternately. The pattern of the under side is similar, but the dark\r\nbrown of the upper surface is replaced by a lighter olive tint.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly may be looked for in May in the open spaces of woods,\r\nparticularly in damp places. It is common all over England, and is found\r\nalso in the south of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is either green or brownish, with a darker dorsal stripe\r\nof the same color, and two white lines on each side. It feeds on the\r\nraspberry (_Rubus idaeus_), the bramble (_R. fruticosus_), and the\r\nstrawberry-leaved cinquefoil (_Potentilla Fragariastrum_), and is full\r\nfed about the end of June.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis is greyish, spotted with black. It is rather elongated,\r\nand without angles, but has a short and sharp projection extending\r\nbackwards from the 'tail.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dingy Skipper_ (_Nisoniades Tages_)\r\n\r\nColour--a dingy brown, indistinctly barred and spotted with a darker\r\ntint, and having a row of small white spots just inside the fringe of\r\nthe hind margins. Under side--a paler brown, with rows of small white\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is common in all parts of England, and is found in a few\r\nlocalities in Scotland and Ireland. It frequents dry banks, and is\r\nparticularly partial to the chalky districts of the south-eastern\r\ncounties. It is on the wing in May, and a second brood appears in lesser\r\nnumbers in August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green, with two yellow stripes on each side, and\r\na row of black spots above each stripe. It feeds on the bird's-foot\r\ntrefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_), and may be found in June, and again in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis (Plate VIII, fig. 12) is shaped something like that of the\r\nlast species, and is coloured green on the front segments, and a rose\r\nred on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is represented in fig. 12 of Plate VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Skipper_ (_Hesperia Thaumas_)\r\n\r\nIn briefly describing the various British butterflies no mention has\r\nbeen made, except in a few cases, of the shape of the wings, this matter\r\nhaving been left to the reader's own observations of our illustrations.\r\nWe will, however, call attention to the somewhat square-cut form of the\r\nwings of _Thaumas_ and the following species.\r\n\r\nThe above-named butterfly (Plate VII, fig. 13) is a lively-looking\r\nlittle insect, its wings being of a bright tawny orange colour, bordered\r\nwith black, beyond which is a light fringe. The male, which is the sex\r\nfigured, is distinguished from the female by an oblique black streak\r\nacross the middle of the front wings. The under side is orange, with a\r\ndecidedly greenish tinge.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly is out in July, and is very abundant and widely\r\ndistributed. It lays its eggs on various grasses, particularly the\r\nmeadow soft-grass (_Holcus lanatus_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar hybernates through the winter, and is full fed in the\r\nfollowing June, when it changes to a green chrysalis after spinning a\r\nlight silken cocoon among the blades of grass. The colour of the\r\ncaterpillar is green, with six longitudinal white stripes--two on the\r\nback, and two on each side.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New Small Skipper_ (_Hesperia Lineola_)\r\n\r\nA few years since (1888) a butterfly was taken in one of our\r\nsouth-eastern counties that closely resembled the well-known _Thaumas_\r\n(or _Linea_), but which turned out to be a species not previously known\r\nin Britain. When, however, the distinguishing features of the new\r\nbutterfly were made known, several entomologists discovered that they\r\nhad already secured the new prize, but that, being ignorant of its\r\ncharacteristics, they had placed it in their series over the label\r\n_Thaumas_.\r\n\r\nSince the above date, this new insect (Plate VII, fig. 18), which is\r\nnamed _Lineola_, has been taken in considerable numbers at Leigh,\r\nHarwich, Southend, and near Shoeburyness in Suffolk, as well as in the\r\nFens of Huntingdonshire; and it is highly probable that it may turn up\r\nin various other localities where it has not yet been observed.\r\n\r\nIt appears on the wing about the first week of July, a little later than\r\n_Thaumas_, but the two kindred species are often found flying together.\r\n\r\nThe chief points by which we distinguish _Lineola_ from the last species\r\nare these: The general appearance of the wings is a bit dingier than in\r\n_Thaumas_; the inner portion of the hind wings is of a bright tawny\r\ncolour in _Thaumas_ but not in _Lineola_; the tips of the antennae are\r\nyellow beneath in _Thaumas_, but black in _Lineola_; and the black\r\nstreak across the fore wings of the latter species is short and\r\ngenerally broken.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _Lineola_ are laid at the end of July or beginning of August\r\non various grasses, chiefly the various species of _Triticum_, but do\r\nnot hatch till the following April.\r\n\r\nThe larva is full fed about the end of June or beginning of July, and\r\nthen changes to a long yellowish-green chrysalis, from which the perfect\r\ninsect emerges in two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lulworth Skipper_ (_Hesperia Actaeon_)\r\n\r\nAlthough this species is somewhat similar to the two preceding, it may\r\nbe readily distinguished by the heavy clouding of dull greenish brown\r\nthat almost covers the wings. The male, which is shown in fig. 14 of\r\nPlate VII, has a black streak across the fore wings, and the female\r\npossesses a semicircular row of tawny spots near the tip of the same\r\nwings, and also a tawny streak near the centre.\r\n\r\nThis is a very local species, having been found only in a few\r\nlocalities. At Lulworth Cove and 'Burning Cliff' in Dorset it has been\r\nmet with in profusion. In Devon it frequents the rough ground near the\r\ncliffs at Sidmouth and Torquay; and it has also been reported as\r\nappearing at Stratford-on-Avon, Shenstone near Lichfield, and the\r\nneighbourhoods of Swanage and Tyneham.\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely hope to see this insect at large without making a\r\nspecial trip to one of its favourite haunts, in which case a day should\r\nbe chosen toward the end of July or early in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Skipper_ (_Hesperia Sylvanus_)\r\n\r\nDuring May, June, and August this butterfly may be seen on grassy banks\r\nin nearly every part of England, as well as in certain localities of\r\nScotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe wings are all of a bright orange-brown colour, with a narrow black\r\nborder, inside which is a broad shading of brown. The latter colour\r\nusually completely covers the hind wings with the exception of about\r\nhalf a dozen squarish spots; and the same colour, together with the dark\r\nbrown wing rays, breaks up the light ground of the fore wings, often\r\nforming several squarish and triangular patches, most distinct near the\r\ntips. The male (Plate VII, fig. 15) may be readily distinguished from\r\nthe female by the presence of a thick dark brown streak across the fore\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe under side of both sexes is pale tawny brown, with a greenish tinge;\r\nand has several rather indistinct yellowish spots.\r\n\r\nThe larva is of a dull green colour, with a dark line on the back. Its\r\nupper surface is dotted with black, and there are white spots on the\r\nunder side of the tenth and eleventh segments. It feeds on several kinds\r\nof grasses, some of its favourites being the meadow soft grass (_Holcus\r\nlanatus_), the cock's-foot (_Dactylis glomerata_), and couch grass\r\n(_Agropyron repens_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Silver-spotted Skipper_ (_Hesperia Comma_)\r\n\r\nThis species is very similar on the upper side to the last, except that\r\nthe squarish spots of both fore and hind wings are much paler and much\r\nmore distinct; and here, too, the male (Plate VII, fig. 16) is to be\r\ndistinguished from the female by a black streak crossing the front wings\r\nobliquely. The under surface has a greenish tinge, more particularly on\r\nthe hind wings; and this side is conspicuously marked with a number of\r\n_white_ square spots with sharp outlines, arranged as shown in fig. 96.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--THE SILVER-SPOTTED SKIPPER--UNDER SIDE.]\r\n\r\nAlthough common in some localities, this butterfly is not widely\r\ndistributed. It is confined to some of the southern and midland counties\r\nof England, and is particularly partial to the chalk districts of the\r\nsouth-east. On the chalk downs of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex it is\r\nmoderately common. It is on the wing during July and August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on certain leguminous plants, among which are the\r\nbird's-foot (_Ornithopus perpusillus_) and the bird's-foot trefoil\r\n(_Lotus corniculatus_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chequered Skipper_ (_Carterocephalus Palaemon_)\r\n\r\nThis is another local insect, more so even than the last, but it\r\nsometimes appears in profusion in certain limited districts. Kettering,\r\nOundle in Northamptonshire, and Monk's Wood in Huntingdonshire are\r\nplaces where it has been taken freely. It appears in June.\r\n\r\nThe wings are chequered with very dark brown and orange. The fore wings\r\nare bordered with small rounded yellow spots, and beside these there are\r\nabout nine very conspicuous yellow spots on the fore wing and three on\r\nthe hind wing. The arrangement of these markings may be seen in fig. 17\r\nof Plate VII.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the greater plantain (_Plantago major_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nCOMMON BRITISH MOTHS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_SPHINGES_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already observed the chief features by which we are able to\r\ndistinguish between butterflies and moths (page 56), so we shall devote\r\nthe present division to a description of the characteristics and life\r\nhistories of some of the latter insects.\r\n\r\nThe number of British butterflies is so limited that space could be\r\nfound for a brief description of every species, but with moths the case\r\nis very different. There are about two thousand known British species of\r\nthis division of the Lepidoptera, and every year adds some newly\r\ndiscovered insects to this long list; we shall therefore have to content\r\nourselves with making a selection of these for individual mention.\r\n\r\nIn doing this I shall endeavour to provide the young entomologist with a\r\nfairly representative list--one that will enable him to become more or\r\nless intimately acquainted with all the principal divisions of the\r\n_Heterocera_; and his attention will be drawn especially to many which\r\nmay be described as 'common' or 'generally distributed,' so that during\r\nhis first few seasons at collecting he may be enabled to identify and\r\nstudy a fair proportion of his captures. Occasionally, however, one of\r\nthe rarer species will be described in order to illustrate some striking\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nWe shall commence with the tribe of _Sphinges_ or _Hawk Moths_.\r\n\r\nThis group consists of three families--the _Sphingidae_, including the\r\nlargest of the 'Hawks,' and the 'Bee Hawks,' the _Sesiidae_ or\r\n'Clearwings,' and the _Zygaenidae_, including the 'Foresters' and the\r\n'Burnets'--numbering in all about forty species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--SPHINGIDAE\r\n\r\nThis family is named from a fancied resemblance of the larvae to the\r\ncelebrated Egyptian sphinx. The perfect insects have very thick bodies,\r\ngenerally tapering toward the tail, and their wings are rather narrow in\r\nproportion to the length, but are exceedingly powerful, and the flight\r\nis, with one or two exceptions, very rapid. The antennae terminate in a\r\nsmall and thin hook.\r\n\r\nMost of these insects fly at dusk, but a few delight in the brightness\r\nand heat of the midday sun. In either case the velocity of their flight\r\nis generally so great that it is a difficult matter to follow them with\r\nthe eye, and a still more difficult matter to secure the insects in the\r\nnet; consequently, the best way to study them is to search out the larvae\r\non their food plants, and rear them till they attain their perfect form.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the _Sphingidae_ are large and smooth, and most of them have\r\na horn projecting from the top of the last segment but one. They all\r\nundergo their metamorphoses under the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Death's-Head Hawk_ (_Acherontia Atropos_)\r\n\r\nOur first example of the Sphinges is the beautiful Death's-Head Hawk\r\nMoth--an insect that often attains a breadth of five inches from tip to\r\ntip when the wings are fully expanded. Its popular title has been\r\napplied on account of the peculiar markings of the thorax, which are\r\nsaid to resemble a human skull; and this feature has certainly some\r\nconnection with the superstitious beliefs of ignorant country folk\r\nconcerning this moth. But this characteristic is probably not the only\r\none that has caused the creature to be regarded with superstitious\r\nalarm. Both its superior dimensions and nocturnal habits serve to\r\nintensify the unfounded fear; but, what is particularly striking and\r\nunique about it is its power of uttering a squeaking sound, which it\r\ndoes when disturbed. Even the earlier stages of the insect possess this\r\nstrange power. The caterpillar makes a peculiar snapping noise when\r\nirritated, and the chrysalis has been observed to squeak shortly before\r\nthe emergence of the perfect form.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this moth are of a very rich dark brown, beautifully\r\nmottled with lighter tawny shades, and with a small but conspicuous\r\nyellow dot near the centre. The hind wings are yellow, with a black band\r\nand margin; and the body is yellow, with six broad black bands, and six\r\nlarge blue spots down the middle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--THE DEATH'S-HEAD HAWK MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe moth is rather widely distributed, and even common in some parts,\r\nbut is not nearly so often met with as the larva. It is on the wing\r\nduring August and September.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the reader will never have an opportunity of\r\ncapturing the perfect form of this remarkable species, but he may with a\r\nlittle perseverance obtain some caterpillars and rear them. These larvae\r\nfeed on the potato, the deadly nightshade (_Atropa Belladonna_), and the\r\nwoody nightshade (_Solanum Dulcamara_); and they are well known to\r\npotato growers in some parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is generally pale yellow, with numerous\r\nsmall black dots, and seven oblique violet stripes on each side. The\r\nhorn is yellowish and rough, and is bent downward, but recurved again at\r\nthe tip.\r\n\r\nIt feeds during the night, and remains hidden throughout the daytime. In\r\nAugust it is fully grown, and then retires into the ground to undergo\r\nits transformations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--THE LARVA OF ATROPOS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Privet Hawk_ (_Sphinx Ligustri_)\r\n\r\nThis is another fine moth, measuring nearly four and a half inches from\r\ntip to tip. It is represented in the centre of Plate IX in its natural\r\ncolours, so that it need not be described.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect flies in June and July, and, although common, is not\r\nfrequently seen at large. The larvae, however, are to be met with in\r\nabundance in privet hedges. Even in the centres of large towns we may\r\nsee them resting on the topmost twigs of a privet hedge, their beautiful\r\ngreen tint closely resembling that of the surrounding leaves. After a\r\nlittle experience they may be readily discerned by a careful observer,\r\nbut there are certain signs by which their presence may be proved before\r\nthey have been actually seen. Sometimes a number of the twigs are\r\ncompletely stripped of their leaves, even the midribs and the leaf\r\nstalks being almost or entirely devoured; and beneath the bushes are\r\nthe large black masses of excrement that tell of the marauders above.\r\nWhen found, these larvae should always be removed on a piece of the twig\r\nto which they are attached, for they hold on so firmly by their claspers\r\nthat it is sometimes almost impossible to remove them from their hold\r\nwithout injury.\r\n\r\nThese caterpillars may easily be distinguished from those of the other\r\n'hawks' by the seven oblique stripes which adorn the sides. These are\r\neach composed of two colours, white and lilac, and form a pretty\r\ncontrast with the bright green of the rest of the body. The horn is\r\nsmooth and curved, and is black with the exception of part of the under\r\nside, which is yellow.\r\n\r\nThey are fully grown in August, and from the end of this month till the\r\nfollowing June the chrysalides may be dug out from under privet and\r\nlilac bushes, both of which are attacked by the larva.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spurge Hawk_ (_Deilephila Euphorbiae_)\r\n\r\nThis is a very rare British species; in fact, it has never been seen in\r\nthis country in its perfect state, but the larva has been found\r\nplentifully at Appledore and Braunton Burrows, in North Devon, feeding\r\non the sea spurge (_Euphorbia Paralias_).\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is shown on Plate IX (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--THE CATERPILLAR OF EUPHORBIAE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is black, with a large number of small yellowish white\r\ndots, and two rows of spots of the same colour on each side. There is\r\nalso a red line on each side, and another down the middle of the back.\r\nThe horn is rough and red with a black tip. It feeds during August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Elephant Hawk_ (_Chaerocampa Porcellus_)\r\n\r\nThis pretty insect is one of the smallest of our hawk moths. It is\r\nwidely distributed, being met with in many parts of England and in the\r\nsouth of Scotland. It flies in June.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are of a dull yellow colour, with rosy-red hind margins,\r\nand a broad border of the same tint on the costal margin. The hind wings\r\nhave also a rosy-red hind margin, and are smoky black along the costae,\r\nand yellow in the anal angle. The body is coloured with bright rose-red,\r\ntinged with olive on the foremost and hindmost segments.\r\n\r\nThe popular name of this and the following species has been applied\r\nbecause of the power which the caterpillar has of extending and\r\nretracting its front segments, a peculiarity which has given the idea of\r\na semblance to the elephant's proboscis. The colour of the caterpillar\r\nis light-brown or green, mottled with dark-brown, dark-green, or black.\r\nIt has a conspicuous eye-like spot on each side of the fifth and sixth\r\nsegments, and has no horn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--THE SMALL ELEPHANT HAWK MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThis larva may be found in July and August, feeding on species of\r\nbedstraw (_Galium verum_, _G. Mollugo_, and _G. palustre_), willow herb\r\n(_Epilobium hirsutum_), or the purple loosestrife (_Lythrum Salicaria_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Elephant_ (_Chaerocampa Elpenor_)\r\n\r\nThis species (Plate IX, fig. 3) is very similar to the last in form and\r\nmarkings; but is, as its name implies, larger.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, too, is very like that of the last species, but may be\r\ndistinguished from it by the possession of a short black horn, tipped\r\nwith white, on the 'tail.' Its colour is green or brown, mottled and\r\nspotted with black. The eye-like spots on its fifth and sixth segments\r\nare black, and each contains a brown spot surrounded by a white line.\r\n\r\nIts chief food plants are the hairy willow herb (_Epilobium hirsutum_),\r\nthree species of bedstraw (_Galium verum_, _G. Mollugo_ and _G.\r\npalustre_), the purple loosestrife (_Lythrum Salicaria_), and the\r\nenchanter's nightshade (_Circaea lutetiana_). It will also feed on the\r\nvine and the apple in confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eyed Hawk_ (_Smerinthus Ocellatus_)\r\n\r\nOur next genus (_Smerinthus_) contains three well-known moths, all of\r\nwhich have the hind margin of the fore wings angulated or indented.\r\n\r\nThe first is the Eyed Hawk, represented in fig. 4 of Plate IX and named\r\nafter the beautiful and conspicuous eye-like spot near the anal angle of\r\neach hind wing.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar has a rough green skin, sprinkled with white dots, and\r\nmarked with seven oblique white lines on each side, each of which is\r\nbordered with dark green above. The spiracles are pinkish, surrounded by\r\nviolet rings; and the horn is blue.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies during May, June, and July; and the caterpillar may be\r\nfound in plenty during August, feeding on the apple, willow (_Salix\r\nalba_), sallow (_S. cinerea_ and _S. Caprea_), poplar (_Populus alba_\r\nand _P. nigra_), aspen (_P. tremula_), and the blackthorn (_Prunus\r\nspinosa_).\r\n\r\nAs with many other _Sphinges_, the larvae are much more commonly seen\r\nthan the perfect insects; but the latter may often be met with resting\r\non tree trunks and fences in the neighbourhood of their food plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Poplar Hawk_ (_Smerinthus Populi_)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--THE POPLAR HAWK.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is very common and very widely distributed, and may be easily\r\nfound in any of its stages. The perfect insect flies during May, June,\r\nand July; and being rather heavy on the wing, it is easily taken with a\r\nnet as it hovers round the branches of its favourite trees or among the\r\nflowers of gardens at dusk. The larva may be beaten from the boughs of\r\npoplars and sallows during August and September, and during the latter\r\nmonth may often be seen creeping down and around the trunks of these\r\ntrees, searching for a suitable spot in which to undergo its changes.\r\nThe pupa may be dug out of the soil at the foot of the same trees\r\nduring the autumn, winter, and spring months.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are ashy grey or greyish brown, marbled with darker\r\ntints, with a conspicuous white spot near the centre. The hind wings are\r\nsimilarly coloured except at the base, where there is a large patch of\r\nbrick-red.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is rough, of a pale green colour dotted with yellow,\r\nwith seven oblique yellow stripes on each side. The spiracles are white,\r\nedged with red; and the horn is yellow on the upper, and reddish on the\r\nunder side. Its chief food plants are the poplar, the Lombardy poplar\r\n(_Populus pyramidalis_), aspen (P_. tremula_), and sallow (_Salix\r\nCaprea_ and _S. cinerea_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lime Hawk_ (_Smerinthus Tiliae_)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful moth (fig. 5, Plate IX) is easily identified by its rich\r\nolive green and brown wings, the fore pair of which have very\r\nconspicuous patches of deep olive, sometimes uniting to form a\r\ncontinuous central bar. It flies in May and June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is rough, of a pale green colour, dotted with yellow,\r\nwith seven oblique yellow stripes on each side. Thus it is very like the\r\nlarva of _Populi_, but may be distinguished from that species by the\r\norange spiracles, and by the horn, which is rough, blue above, and\r\nyellow beneath. Behind the horn, too, there is a flat purple or violet\r\nscale with an edging of orange.\r\n\r\nThe food plants of this species are the lime (_Tilia vulgaris_), elm\r\n(_Ulmus campestris_), and the hazel (_Corylus Avellana_), from which the\r\nlarvae may be beaten in August and September, and from under these the\r\npupae may be dug out during the winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Humming-Bird Hawk_ (_Macroglossa Stellatarum_)\r\n\r\nThe genus to which this insect belongs contains three interesting\r\nBritish species. Their antennae are thickened toward the end, but\r\nterminate in a small curved bristle. Their wings are rather short and\r\nbroad; their bodies are very thick, terminating in a broad tuft of hair;\r\nand the perfect insects fly during the daytime, delighting in the\r\nhottest sunshine. The larvae feed principally on low-growing plants, and\r\nundergo their metamorphoses on the ground among the foliage.\r\n\r\nOn Plate IX (fig. 6) one of these pretty moths is shown. It is the\r\nHumming-bird Hawk, so called on account of its exceedingly rapid\r\nhumming-bird-like flight, accompanied by a soft humming sound.\r\n\r\nThis insect is very common; and, being very partial to the attractions\r\noffered by many of our favourite garden flowers, it ought to be well\r\nknown to all observers of nature.\r\n\r\nTake your stand near a bed of petunias or verbenas, or close to a\r\nhoneysuckle in bloom, on any hot summer's day, and you are almost sure\r\nto be rewarded by a peep at the wonderful flight and interesting ways of\r\nthis moth. It makes its appearance so suddenly that you first view it as\r\nan apparently motionless insect, suspended in the air, and thrusting its\r\nlong proboscis into the tube of an attractive flower. Its wings vibrate\r\nso rapidly that they are quite invisible, and give rise to the soft hum\r\nalready mentioned. Then it darts from one flower to another, making a\r\nsimilar brief stay before each while it sucks the grateful sweets. Raise\r\nyour hand as if to strike, and suddenly it vanishes you know not where.\r\nBut it is as bold as it is wary, and will often return to the selfsame\r\nflower as if to defy your power. A sharp sweep of your net in a\r\nhorizontal direction, or a sudden downward stroke, _may_ secure it; but\r\nif you miss it, as you probably will, it will disappear like a phantom,\r\nand give you no opportunity of making a second attempt.\r\n\r\nThis moth is on the wing throughout the hottest months of the year--May\r\nto September, and will often greet you as you roam over flowery banks in\r\nsearch of butterflies.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the lady's bedstraw (_Galium verum_), hedge\r\nbedstraw (_G. Mollugo_), and the goose grass (_G. Aparine_), and may be\r\nsearched for in August and September. It is rough, green or brownish,\r\nand dotted with white. Along each side are two light lines. The horn is\r\nthin and short, rough, and points upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Broad-bordered Bee Hawk_ (_Macroglossa Fuciformis_)\r\n\r\nThe two other moths of this genus are called Bee Hawks from their\r\nresemblance to the humble bee. They are very much alike, but may be\r\ndistinguished by a difference in the width of the dark border of the\r\nwings; and are named Broad-bordered and Narrow-bordered respectively.\r\n\r\nThe former is illustrated in the woodcut appended. The fore wings are\r\ntransparent like those of bees, with a dark central spot and a broad\r\nreddish-brown hind margin. The base and costa are black and tinged with\r\ngreen. The hind wings are similarly coloured, but have no central spot.\r\nThe body is olive-brown, with a broad reddish belt, and behind are tufts\r\nof hair, which are spread out when the insect flies, just after the\r\nmanner of the tail feathers of a bird. The moth flies in May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--THE BROAD-BORDERED BEE HAWK.]\r\n\r\nThe larva resembles that of _Stellatarum_, but exhibits a violet tint\r\nabove the legs. Its horn, too, is curved, and of a reddish or brownish\r\ncolour. It feeds on the honeysuckle (_Lonicera Periclymenum_), ragged\r\nrobin (_Lychnis Flos-cuculi_), evening campion (_L. vespertina_), red\r\ncampion (_L. diurna_), lady's bedstraw (_Galium verum_), and the field\r\nscabious (_Scabiosa arvensis_), during the month of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily SESIIDAE--THE CLEARWINGS\r\n\r\nThis family contains fourteen very pretty British insects that differ\r\nvery much from other moths in many important and interesting\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nTheir antennae, like those of the _Sphingidae_, are thickest beyond the\r\nmiddle, and those of the males are slightly _ciliated_ or hairy. Their\r\nbodies are slender, and terminate behind in tufts of hair. The hind\r\nwings in all cases are transparent, margined and veined with black or\r\nbrown; and the fore wings also, in most cases, have transparent bases.\r\n\r\nThese moths delight in the hottest sunshine, and may be seen gracefully\r\nhovering over the flowers in our gardens, looking more like gnats, bees,\r\nand wasps, than moths.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of these insects are all wood-eaters, and spend their time\r\nwithin the stems of shrubs and trees, eating out galleries in the\r\nmaterial that forms both their food and their home. Within these they\r\nalso undergo their changes, and do not expose themselves to the free air\r\nand light till they reach their perfect stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hornet Clearwing of the Poplar_ (_Trochilium Apiformis_)\r\n\r\nWe can find space for a mention of only two of the clearwings, the first\r\nof which is an insect that closely resembles the dreaded hornet, and\r\nwhose larva feeds in the stems of poplars--features which will account\r\nfor the above name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--THE HORNET CLEARWING OF THE POPLAR.]\r\n\r\nThe head of this species is yellow, its thorax brown with a large yellow\r\npatch on each side, its abdomen yellow with two brown belts, and its\r\nlegs reddish orange. The front wings are transparent, with brown costae,\r\nand all the wings are margined with brown.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, when full fed, makes a cocoon with silk and the chips\r\nof wood that it has bitten off; and in this undergoes its metamorphoses.\r\nIt is fully grown in April, and the moth flies from the end of May to\r\nthe end of July.\r\n\r\nThere is another 'Hornet Clearwing,' the larva of which feeds on the\r\nstems of osiers. It may be distinguished from the species just described\r\nby a yellow 'collar' between the head and thorax, both of which are\r\nblackish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Currant Clearwing_ (_Sesia Tipuliformis_)\r\n\r\nThis is by far the commonest of all the Clearwings, and only too well\r\nknown to those who grow currants. Examine the shoots of _Ribes rubrum_\r\n(red currant) and _R. nigrum_ (black currant), especially those that\r\npresent a withered or half-withered appearance, and you will almost\r\ncertainly meet with signs of the presence of this intruder. Little\r\nwriggling larvae occupy the pithless stems throughout the winter and\r\nspring. These are full grown in April, and in June the pretty little\r\nmoth emerges through a hole in the side of a shoot, leaving the empty\r\npupa case within its former home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--THE CURRANT CLEARWING.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this moth have black margins, and a black transverse\r\nbar beyond the middle. The body is black, with three pale yellow belts,\r\nand black tufts of hair at the tip.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ZYGAENIDAE\r\n\r\nThe remaining family of the _Sphinges_--the _Zygaenidae_--includes seven\r\nBritish species, three of which are known popularly as the Foresters and\r\nthe others as the Burnets.\r\n\r\nTheir antennae are thickest beyond the middle, but do not terminate in a\r\nhook. Their wings are narrow and completely covered with scales.\r\n\r\nThese moths are very sluggish creatures, spending the greater part of\r\ntheir time at rest on the stems of low-growing plants. When they do fly,\r\ntheir flight is short and heavy, and their pretty wings glisten in the\r\nsunshine (for they are lovers of the sun), giving them the appearance of\r\nbees rather than of moths. On account of this natural sluggishness, they\r\nare exceedingly local, for they never move far from the spots where\r\ntheir food plants abound, and where they had previously spent the\r\nearlier stages of their existence. Thus we often come across a very\r\nlimited piece of ground actually alive with them, and outside which not\r\na single specimen is to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe larvae, too, are sluggish creatures, with soft and plump cylindrical\r\nbodies and no horns. I will briefly describe three members of this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Forester_ (_Ino Statices_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are semi-transparent, and of a beautiful\r\nglossy green. The hind wings also are semi-transparent, but of a dull\r\nsmoky tint. The thorax and abdomen are both of a brilliant metallic\r\ngreen colour. The tips of the antennae are blunt, and the male may be\r\ndistinguished from his mate by these organs being slightly fringed or\r\nciliated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--THE FORESTER.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dingy grey or greenish, with a row of black spots\r\ndown the back, and a whitish stripe on each side. It feeds on the common\r\nsorrel (_Rumex acetosa_) and the sheep sorrel (_R. acetosella_), and\r\nwhen fully grown it spins a cocoon on the stem of its food plant, and\r\nthere changes to a chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe larva may be found during May and early June. The chrysalis state\r\nlasts only a few days, and the moth is on the wing during June and\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Broad-bordered Five-spotted Burnet_ (_Zygaena Trifolii_)\r\n\r\nOn Plate IX (fig. 7) will be found a coloured representation of this\r\nBurnet. The two crimson spots in the base of the fore wing are very\r\nclose together, and often touch. The same remark also applies to the two\r\nspots on the middle of the wing. A glance at the list of British Moths\r\n(Appendix I) will show that we have also a _Narrow_-bordered\r\nFive-spotted Burnet. This insect is very similar to the species now\r\nunder consideration, but may be identified by the narrower purplish\r\nmargin on the hind wings, and also by the shape of the antennae, which\r\nare not thickened so much near the end as they are in _Trifolii_.\r\n\r\nThe larva of the present species is yellowish or greenish, with a row of\r\nblack spots on the back and a row on each side. It feeds on the\r\nbird's-foot trefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_), hop trefoil (_Trifolium\r\nprocumbens_), and the horse-shoe vetch (_Hippocrepis comosa_) in May.\r\nLate in May or in early June the chrysalis may be found in a silken\r\ncocoon attached to a stem or leaf; and the perfect insect flies during\r\nJune and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Six-spotted Burnet_ (_Zygaena Filipendulae_)\r\n\r\nSo common is this moth, and so conspicuous when it flies in the blazing\r\nsun, that it must be familiar to almost everybody. On a bright midsummer\r\nday hundreds may often be started from their grassy beds from one little\r\npatch of ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--THE SIX-SPOTTED BURNET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--THE LARVA OF FILIPENDULAE.]\r\n\r\nThe colouring of the wings is much the same as in the last species, but\r\nthere are two crimson spots instead of one near the tips of the fore\r\npair.\r\n\r\nThe larvae may be seen in vast numbers during May and June, feeding on\r\nclovers (_Trifolium pratense_ and _T. repens_), and the bird's-foot\r\ntrefoil (_Lotus corniculatus_); and in the latter month thousands of the\r\nchrysalides, inclosed in shuttle-shaped cocoons on grass stems, may be\r\nseen on downs and sunny banks in almost every part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, which is yellow, may be known by the two rows of black\r\nspots that adorn each segment of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_BOMBYCES_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tribe is an important one, inasmuch as it contains those few moths\r\nwhose silk is of present or anticipated commercial value. Many of the\r\nBritish members, even, make silken cocoons of moderate compactness, but\r\nnone of them yield a quantity and quality of silk to justify any attempt\r\nto utilise it in the arts.\r\n\r\nThere are more than a hundred British species in this group, and these\r\nrepresent no less than seventeen families, which exhibit a great variety\r\nin their general appearance and habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--NYCTEOLIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Green Silver-lined_ (_Hylophila prasinana_)\r\n\r\nThis family, under the name of _Chloephoridae_, is included by some\r\nauthors among the _Tortrices_ (page 298), which they somewhat resemble\r\nin habits. It contains only four species, of which we will take one\r\nexample--the Green Silver-lined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--THE GREEN SILVER-LINED.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this insect are pale green, with three oblique silvery\r\nwhite lines, the middle one of which is far more distinct than the other\r\ntwo. The hind wings are silvery white in the female, and yellow in the\r\nmale. It flies in May, and is common in the wooded districts of the\r\nsouth-eastern counties.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green, dotted and striped with yellow, and has a\r\nreddish transverse band on the second segment. It feeds on oak (_Quercus\r\nRobur_), birch (_Betula alba_), hazel (_Corylus_ _Avellana_), beech\r\n(_Fagus sylvatica_), and alder (_Alnus glutinosa_), from which trees it\r\nmay be beaten in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--NOLIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Short-cloaked Moth_ (_Nola cucullatella_)\r\n\r\nWe select this common moth as a representative of the small family\r\n_Nolidae_, which contains only five British species. These are all small\r\ninsects. They are nocturnal in their habits, and may be found at rest on\r\nthe trunks of trees during the daytime. The caterpillars are hairy, and\r\nundergo their metamorphoses within silken cocoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--THE SHORT-CLOAKED MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of _Cucullatella_ are pearly grey, with a dark patch at\r\nthe base, a triangular spot on the middle of the costal margin, and wavy\r\nlines beyond this, parallel with the hind margin. The hind wings are\r\ngrey, and devoid of any markings.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a brownish colour, with a line of lighter patches\r\ndown the back, and it is covered with little tufts of hair. It feeds on\r\nthe blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), whitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_),\r\nand also on plum trees in our gardens during the month of May. The moth\r\nis on the wing during June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--LITHOSIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Muslin Moth_ (_Nudaria mundana_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Lithosiidae_ contains several small moths, distinguished from\r\nthe other _Bombyces_ by the narrowness of their fore wings. When the\r\ninsects are at rest, all the wings are wrapped closely round the body.\r\nThey fly at dusk on summer evenings, but may be obtained during the\r\ndaytime by beating the boughs of trees. If an open net be held under the\r\nboughs during this operation, the moths will generally feign death and\r\nallow themselves to fall into it when they are disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--THE MUSLIN MOTH.]\r\n\r\nMost of the larvae of this family feed on the lichens that cover walls\r\nand the bark of trees, and they conceal themselves so artfully among\r\nthis peculiar vegetation that it is no easy matter to search them out;\r\nprobably many still remain unknown to entomologists.\r\n\r\nOur first example--the Muslin Moth--has light brownish-grey and semi\r\ntransparent wings, the front pair of which have darker markings arranged\r\nas shown in the illustration. It is a common moth, and may be met with\r\nin July and August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on lichens in June. It is of a dull grey colour,\r\nwith a yellow stripe down the back, and has numerous little tufts of\r\nlight hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Footman_ (_Lithosia lurideola_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are of a leaden grey, with a bright\r\nyellow costal stripe which dwindles to a point just before it reaches\r\nthe tip. The hind wings are very pale yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--THE COMMON FOOTMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is black, with a reddish line on each side just above the\r\nfeet. It may be found during May and June among the lichens of oaks,\r\nblackthorns, and firs, especially in the woods of the south of England.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect flies during July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--EUCHELIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Cinnabar_ (_Euchelia Jacobaeae_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Eucheliidae_ contains only four British species, two of which\r\nmust receive a share of our attention. The first of these is the\r\nCinnabar Moth, which is common in all localities where its food\r\nplants--the groundsel (_Senecio vulgaris_) and the ragwort (_S.\r\nJacobaea_)--abound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--THE LARVA OF JACOBAEAE.]\r\n\r\nIts colours are so striking that a glance at its representation (fig. 1\r\nof Plate X) will render a written description quite unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is a very familiar and conspicuous object. Its colour is\r\nbright orange, broken by several broad black rings; and its body is\r\nthinly covered with hair. When fully grown (July or August) it descends\r\nto the ground, and there changes to a smooth and shining reddish-brown\r\nchrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in June or early in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scarlet Tiger_ (_Callimorpha Dominula_)\r\n\r\nThis is certainly one of the most beautiful of all our moths. Its fore\r\nwings are dark olive green, with a lovely metallic lustre, and boldly\r\nmarked with large white and yellow spots. These spots are arranged\r\ngenerally like those in the illustration, but are subject to great\r\nvariation. The hind wings are crimson, with large black patches, chiefly\r\ndistributed near the hind margin. The thorax is black, with two white\r\nstreaks; and the abdomen crimson, with a black line down the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--THE SCARLET TIGER.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is a common one. It may be taken in June and July. I have seen\r\nit flying somewhat freely while the sun was still shining brightly.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very dark lead colour, nearly black; and is covered\r\nwith little wart-like projections, from each of which protrudes a short\r\nblack hair. There is a broad yellow broken line down the back, and two\r\nothers on the sides. It feeds on the hound's-tongue (_Cynoglossum\r\nofficinale_) and many other low-growing plants, hybernates through the\r\nwinter, and is fully grown in May. Like the other members of this\r\nfamily, it spins a light silken cocoon, in which the hairs from its body\r\nare interwoven.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--CHELONIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Wood Tiger_ (_Nemeophila Plantaginis_)\r\n\r\nThe _Cheloniidae_ are popularly known as the Tigers--a title suggested by\r\nthe tiger-like colouring of some of the prominent species. They differ\r\nfrom the Scarlet Tiger and the other members of the _Eucheliidae_ in that\r\nthe males have ciliated or fringed antennae. The larvae, too, are more\r\ndensely covered with hair.\r\n\r\nThe Wood Tiger (fig. 2, Plate X) is a beautiful insect, somewhat\r\nvariable in its markings, but so conspicuously coloured that our\r\nillustration cannot fail to lead to its identification. It may be found\r\ncommonly among the undergrowth of our southern woods during May and\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dark brown or brownish black, covered with little\r\nhair-bearing warts. The hairs are long and black on the foremost and\r\nhind segments, but shorter and of a brown colour on the middle of the\r\nbody. It issues from the egg in September, feeds for a week or two on\r\nthe leaves of violets (_Viola canina_ and _V. odorata_), heartsease (_V.\r\ntricolor_), plantain (_Plantago_), or groundsel (_Senecio vulgaris_),\r\nand then hybernates till the following March. It is fully grown in May,\r\nand then spins a light cocoon, with which its hairs are interwoven,\r\namong the leaves of its food plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tiger_ (_Arctia caia_)\r\n\r\nThis splendid moth is exceedingly variable in its colour and markings,\r\nbut its usual appearance corresponds closely with that of the\r\nillustration on Plate X (fig. 3). In some specimens the cream colour\r\nalmost entirely covers the fore wings, while in others all four of the\r\nwings are completely covered with shades of brown. This insect is\r\nprobably known to all my readers, for it is abundant everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe larva is as well known as the perfect insect. It is a kind of\r\nuniversal feeder, partaking readily of almost every low-growing plant,\r\nwith perhaps a special partiality for dead nettles (_Lamium album_ and\r\n_L. purpureum_). It feeds also on the lime tree (_Tilia vulgaris_), and\r\nis commonly met with on apple trees and on the various plants of our\r\nflower beds. The young caterpillar makes its appearance in the autumn,\r\nand hybernates after feeding for two or three weeks only. It is full\r\ngrown in June, when it spins a silken cocoon, and changes to a shiny\r\nblack chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of the larva is black, but it is covered all over with\r\nlong hairs, those down the middle of the back being grey, and the others\r\nbrown. This familiar larva is known popularly as the Woolly Bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cream-spot Tiger_ (_Arctia villica_)\r\n\r\nThere is yet another Tiger--the Cream-spot--too beautiful and too common\r\nto be excluded from our list. It is represented on Plate X (fig. 4);\r\nand, like the others of its genus, is so boldly marked that mistaken\r\nidentity is impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is a very sluggish moth, more often seen at rest than on the wing,\r\nand will suffer itself to be roughly handled without making any attempt\r\nto escape.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar may be observed on sunny banks, generally feeding on\r\nchickweed (_Stellaria media_) but sometimes on various other low-growing\r\nweeds, including the dock and the dandelion. Its colour is black, with\r\nred head and legs, and its body is covered with long brown hairs. It\r\ncommences to feed in the autumn, hybernates throughout the winter, and\r\nis full grown in May, towards the end of which month it changes to a\r\nblack chrysalis within a light silken web.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Buff Ermine_ (_Spilosoma lubricipeda_)\r\n\r\nThe _Cheloniidae_ also include three moths that are popularly known as\r\nthe Ermines, two of which--the Buff and the White--are exceedingly\r\ncommon, and are among the constant visitors to our gardens during June\r\nand July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--THE BUFF ERMINE.]\r\n\r\nThe Buff Ermine has all four wings of a buff or ochreous tint, and\r\nspotted with black as here represented.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is whitish, with a white line down the middle of the\r\nback, and its body is covered with long light brown hairs. It feeds on\r\nthe dock (_Rumex_) and many other low-growing plants during August and\r\nSeptember, and spends the winter in the chrysalis state, lying within a\r\nloose cocoon on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--THE WHITE ERMINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The White Ermine_ (_Spilosoma Menthastri_)\r\n\r\nIn this species the wings are of a pale cream colour, and the dots of\r\nthe fore wings are more uniformly distributed than in the last. Its\r\nhabits and life history closely correspond with those of _Lubricipeda_,\r\nand its larva may be found feeding on the same plants.\r\n\r\nThis latter may be distinguished from the caterpillar of the last\r\nspecies by the dark brown or black colour of the body, and the presence\r\nof an orange line down the back. It is covered with long brown hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--HEPIALIDAE\r\n\r\nThe five species which compose this family are known as the Swifts, a\r\ntitle which they have earned by their rather rapid flight. Their wings\r\nare narrow, and the antennae very short.\r\n\r\nIn the larval state they are long, naked and unsightly grubs, that live\r\nunder the surface of the ground and feed on the roots of plants. The\r\nchrysalides are armed with short spines projecting from the segments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ghost Swift_ (_Hepialus Humuli_)\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of these moths is the Ghost Swift, which may be\r\nseen in hundreds on waste places in the south of England during the\r\nmonth of June. The wings of the male are white, with a silky gloss, and\r\na very narrow brown margin. The fore wings of the female are yellow,\r\nmarked with irregular reddish lines. The hind wings are of a dull smoke\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--THE GHOST SWIFT--FEMALE.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is pale yellow, with a brown head, and a brown horny plate on\r\nthe front of the second segment. It feeds throughout the winter on the\r\nroots of numerous plants, including the dock, dandelion, burdock, white\r\ndead nettle, black horehound, and the hop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Swift_ (_Hepialus lupulinus_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the male of this species are brown, with a bent\r\nwhitish streak, sometimes broken, passing from the base to the middle of\r\nthe inner margin, and then to the apex. The hind wings are smoke\r\ncoloured, with a light brownish fringe. The female is much less\r\ndistinctly marked, and presents a rather dingy appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--THE COMMON SWIFT.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is dingy white, with brown horny plates on the second, third\r\nand fourth segments. It feeds on the roots of dead nettles (_Lamium\r\nalbum_ and _L. purpureum_), black horehound (_Ballota nigra_), and\r\nvarious other herbaceous plants, throughout the winter months, and is\r\nfull grown in April.\r\n\r\nThis insect is abundant everywhere in waste places, and may be seen on\r\nthe wing in May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--COSSIDAE\r\n\r\nThe members of this family have longer antennae than the _Hepialidae_, and\r\nthe females are provided with extended ovipositors which enable them to\r\nplace their eggs in the deep crevices of the bark of trees.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are naked or only very slightly hairy, and have a plate on the\r\nsecond segment. They feed on the wood of trees or the interior of the\r\nstems of reeds. The pupae have spiny projections on each segment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Goat Moth_ (_Cossus ligniperda_)\r\n\r\nThere are only three British species of this family, the largest of\r\nwhich is the Goat Moth, so called on account of the characteristic odour\r\nof the larva, an odour said to resemble that emitted by the goat.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this fine moth are pale brown, clouded with white, and\r\nmarked by numerous wavy transverse lines. The hind wings are somewhat\r\nsimilar, but of a duller tint, and the markings are less distinct. Its\r\naverage breadth from tip to tip is over three inches, and it sometimes\r\nreaches nearly four inches.\r\n\r\nThe larva is a most interesting creature. It is dark reddish brown on\r\nthe back, and flesh colour beneath; and its head is intensely black. It\r\nfeeds on the solid wood of the willow, poplar, oak, elm, and other\r\ntrees. The infected trees are often so riddled with the burrows of these\r\nlarvae that they are completely destroyed, and the presence of the\r\nintruders is frequently indicated by a heap of small chips of wood lying\r\non the ground near the roots. The odour of the larvae, too, is so\r\npowerful, that there is generally no difficulty in ascertaining their\r\nwhereabouts by it alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--THE GOAT MOTH.]\r\n\r\nIt is not always in living trees, however, that we find these creatures,\r\nfor they often feed on rotting wood, such as the remains of old palings\r\nand posts, that lie on the ground in damp places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--THE LARVA OF LIGNIPERDA (LESS THAN HALF FULL\r\nSIZE).]\r\n\r\nWhen fully grown they construct a strong cocoon of chips of wood, bound\r\ntogether by silk, and within this they change to the chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe moth emerges in June or July, and is commonly found resting on the\r\nbark of willows and poplars during the daytime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Leopard Moth_ (_Zeuzera pyrina_)\r\n\r\nThe wings of this species are white and semi-transparent, and marked\r\nwith numerous bluish-black spots in such a way as to remind one of the\r\nskin of the leopard. Its body is very long, and the antennae of the male\r\nare doubly fringed for about half their length from the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--THE LEOPARD MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the wood of various trees--elm, apple, pear,\r\nash, alder, poplar, horse chestnut, birch, lilac, and several others. It\r\nis yellowish, with black shiny spots, and a black plate on the second\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--THE LARVA OF PYRINA (ONLY PARTLY GROWN).]\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in July, and is widely distributed. It is attracted by\r\nbright lights, but the best way to obtain it is to search the trunks and\r\nbranches of trees that are known to harbour the larvae early in the\r\nmorning, and so obtain newly emerged specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--LIPARIDAE\r\n\r\nPassing over the two small species which are the only British\r\nrepresentatives of the family _Cochliopodidae_, we come to the\r\ninteresting _Liparidae_, the remarkable feature of which is that most of\r\nthe caterpillars are adorned with brush-like tufts of hair, and even the\r\nchrysalides are hairy.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects are not brilliantly coloured, but generally display\r\nvery pale tints; and the antennae of the males are pectinated or\r\nfeathered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brown Tail_ (_Porthesia chrysorrh[oe]a_)\r\n\r\nThe family contains two moths--the Brown Tail and the Yellow Tail--that\r\nare very similar in appearance and habits. Both have white wings, and\r\ntheir bodies also are white with the exception of the tuft of coloured\r\nhair at the tip of the abdomen, which gives the names to the species.\r\nTheir larvae may both be found feeding on the same trees (whitethorn),\r\nand both change to a brown hairy chrysalis within a loose cocoon among\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Chrysorrh[oe]a_ is black, with four rows of little\r\nwart-like projections on each side, from which proceed little tufts of\r\nhairs. These hairs are reddish with the exception of one row on each\r\nside, which is white. The tenth and eleventh segments have each a\r\nscarlet tubercle, and there are also other small spots of the same\r\ncolour on some of the front segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--THE BROWN TAIL.]\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on the blackthorn in addition to the tree mentioned\r\nabove, and is full grown in June. The moth flies in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gipsy_ (_Ocneria dispar_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the male are smoky brown, with darker markings,\r\nincluding a V-shaped black mark near the centre. The hind wings are\r\nbrown, darker near the margin. The female is dingy yellowish white, with\r\ndarker markings arranged as in the male. The male is much inferior in\r\nsize, and its antennae are very strongly pectinated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--THE GIPSY--MALE.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is brownish black, finely dotted with yellowish grey. There is\r\na grey stripe down the middle of the back, and six tubercles on each\r\nsegment give rise to tufts of long hair. It feeds on the whitethorn\r\n(_Crataegus oxyacantha_), blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), and various\r\nfruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is full grown in June, and the moth appears in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Black Arches_ (_Psilura Monacha_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the Black Arches are white, marked with zigzag black\r\nlines as shown in our illustration. The hind wings are smoky grey. The\r\nhinder segments of the abdomen are banded with black and rose-pink. The\r\nmale is much smaller than the female, and has the antennae strongly\r\npectinated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--THE BLACK ARCHES--MALE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is hairy, and of a greyish-white colour. A brown stripe\r\nruns down the back. On the top of the second segment are two blue\r\ntubercles; and there is also a tubercle, of a reddish colour, on each of\r\nthe ninth, tenth, and eleventh segments. It feeds on the oak, birch,\r\nfir, and the apple; and is full grown in June or July.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies during July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vapourer Moth_ (_Orgyia antiqua_)\r\n\r\nDuring the hottest summer months, and particularly in August and\r\nSeptember, a rather small brown moth may be seen almost everywhere,\r\nflying rapidly and in a very erratic manner in the bright rays of the\r\nmidday sun. This is the common Vapourer Moth, which may be known at once\r\nby its bright chestnut colour, with darker transverse markings, and a\r\nwhite crescent-shaped spot in the anal angle of the fore wings. It seems\r\nsomewhat partial to civilised life, for it frequents the streets of our\r\nmetropolis, even in the very densely populated parts; and the larva is\r\none of the commonest of the insect forms infesting our gardens and\r\nsquares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--THE VAPOURER MOTH--MALE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--THE FEMALE VAPOURER.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is variously coloured; but the prevailing tints are dark\r\nbrown, grey, and pink. On the second segment are two long tufts of hair\r\ndirected forward, and on the twelfth segment a similar tuft directed\r\nbackward. On each of the segments five to eight inclusive is a\r\nbrush-like tuft of yellowish hairs. It feeds on almost every tree\r\nusually to be found in parks and gardens.\r\n\r\nWhen fully grown it spins a web on the bark of a tree, or on a wall or\r\nfence, and changes to a hairy chrysalis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--LARVA OF THE VAPOURER MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe female of this species is wingless, and never moves away from the\r\ncocoon out of which she has crawled, but lays her eggs on the outside of\r\nthe silken web, and there remains to die.\r\n\r\nThe clusters of eggs may be found in abundance throughout the winter\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--BOMBYCIDAE\r\n\r\nThis family contains eleven thick-bodied moths, mostly of large size, in\r\nwhich the predominating colours are greys and browns. Their hind wings\r\nare generally paler than the front pair, and less distinctly marked; and\r\nthe antennae of the males are pectinated.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are very hairy, but the hairs are uniformly\r\ndistributed, and not arranged in tufts as in the larvae of the last\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalides are inclosed in silken cocoons, but are not hairy.\r\n\r\nWe shall briefly examine three of the members of this family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Oak Eggar_ (_Bombyx Quercus_)\r\n\r\nThe male of this species is shown on Plate X (fig. 5). The female is\r\nmuch larger, and of a pale tawny colour.\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of the caterpillar is black; but it is so closely\r\ncovered with short yellowish brown hairs that the black is scarcely\r\nvisible, excepting when the creature rolls itself up into a ring, which\r\nit does when alarmed. The spiracles are white, and there is a series of\r\nwhite spots down the middle of the back and along each side. It feeds on\r\nwhitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_), heather (_Calluna_, _Erica_), poplar\r\n(_Populus nigra_), and various other plants and trees.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the larva hybernates through the winter, is full grown in the\r\nfollowing May, and the moth appears in July; but in Scotland the\r\ncaterpillar does not spin its cocoon till September, hybernates in the\r\nchrysalis state, and emerges in the following June. The same is true of\r\nthe Cornish Eggars; but along the coast of South Devon both varieties\r\nare to be met with.\r\n\r\nThe male Eggar seems to enjoy the bright sunshine, for I have seen large\r\nnumbers flying over the rugged cliffs of the south-west throughout all\r\nhours of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Drinker_ (_Odonestis potatoria_)\r\n\r\nThe popular name of this species is applied on account of a peculiar\r\nfeature of the larva, which sucks up the dewdrop that lies on its food\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the male is tawny and brown, with a reddish tinge; that of\r\nthe female is yellow. The front wing has an oblique dark bar passing\r\nfrom the apex to the middle of the inner margin; also two white\r\nspots--one in the middle of the wing, and the other between it and the\r\ncostal margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--THE DRINKER--MALE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dark bluish grey above, and has a line of orange\r\nspots on each side. Along the spiracles are oblique orange streaks, and\r\na series of tufts of white hair. It feeds on the annual meadow-grass\r\n(_Poa annua_), and several other grasses. It is a hybernator, commencing\r\nits caterpillar state in the autumn, and reaching its full dimensions\r\nabout the end of the following May.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies during July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lappet_ (_Lasiocampa quercifolia_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Bombycidae_ is the Lappet (Plate X, fig. 6), a\r\nlarge moth, the female often measuring considerably over three inches\r\nfrom tip to tip. The wings are of a rich reddish brown, and exhibit a\r\nbeautiful purplish bloom in a newly emerged insect. Scalloped black\r\nlines pass transversely across each wing, and a small black dot lies\r\nnear the centre of the fore wings.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very variable in colour, but is usually grey or\r\nreddish brown. A deep purple band lies between the second and third\r\nsegments, and another between the third and fourth. On the twelfth there\r\nis a small hump, and a pale stripe, more or less distinct, runs along\r\neach side. It feeds on the blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), buckthorn\r\n(_Rhamnus catharticus_), and the white willow (_Salix alba_).\r\n\r\nThe moth is not uncommon, and is on the wing in June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ENDROMIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Kentish Glory_ (_Endromis versicolor_)\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Kentish Glory is the only British representative of its\r\nfamily. The male is shown in Plate X (fig. 7); the female is larger and\r\nsimilarly marked, but its colours are not so bright.\r\n\r\nThis moth is not common, but may be seen occasionally in the birch woods\r\nof the southern counties. The males fly rapidly in the bright sunshine,\r\nbut the females must be searched for on the bark and branches of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid in April on the twigs of the birch (_Betula alba_),\r\nand the young caterpillar emerges early in May. It is gregarious at\r\nfirst, but loses its social tendencies as it gets older. When full\r\ngrown, it is of a pale green colour, with white spiracles, a dark green\r\nline down the back, and an oblique white stripe on each side of each\r\nsegment. The sides are dotted with black and brown, and there is a\r\nconspicuous hump on the top of the twelfth segment.\r\n\r\nWhen fully grown it spins a cocoon among the dead leaves beneath the\r\ntree, and in this it spends the winter months in the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--SATURNIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Emperor Moth_ (_Saturnia pavonia_)\r\n\r\nHere is another family with but one British member; but in this, as in\r\nthe last case, the only representative is a really beautiful insect. The\r\nmale _Pavonia_ is shown on Plate X (fig. 8), and will need no written\r\ndescription as an aid to its identification. The female is larger, and\r\nsimilarly marked, but the ground colour of the wings is pale grey.\r\n\r\nThis moth is abundant almost everywhere, and may be looked for in the\r\nneighbourhood of heaths and woods early in the month of May.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on a large number of plants and trees, among which may\r\nbe mentioned the willow (_Salix alba_), blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_),\r\nelder (_Sambucus nigra_), whitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_), bramble\r\n(_Rubus fruticosus_), heaths (_Erica tetralix_ and _E. cinerea_), and\r\nthe meadow-sweet (_Spiraea ulmaria_). Its colour is a lovely green; and\r\neach segment has several pink tubercles, each surrounded by a black\r\nring, and giving rise to a tuft of short black hairs. The spiracles are\r\norange.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn it spins a pear-shaped cocoon of silk, open at the small\r\nend (fig. 28).\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned in passing that, in the case of some of the\r\nlarger moths of the few preceding families, the young entomologist is\r\nlikely to meet with larvae more frequently than the perfect insect. These\r\nmoths, however, are mostly very hardy and easily reared; and a beginner\r\ncannot do better than endeavour to obtain either ova or larvae, in order\r\nthat he may be able to watch the different species through their various\r\nstages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--DREPANULIDAE\r\n\r\nWe now reach a family containing six small moths that differ in many\r\nimportant particulars from those we have just been considering. They are\r\nof such slender build that a beginner may easily mistake them for\r\nGeometers. Their wings, though small, are broad, and well proportioned\r\nto their bodies. In five cases out of the six the front wings are more\r\nor less hooked at the tips, and on this account the moths in question\r\nare called the Hook Tips.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are not hairy, but they all have little fleshy projections on\r\ntheir backs. Their bodies also taper to a point behind, and the last\r\npair of claspers are wanting, so that they have only fourteen walking\r\nappendages. When at rest they usually fix themselves by their claspers\r\nonly, their pointed 'tails' being directed slightly upward, and all the\r\nfront segments being also elevated. When about to change, they descend\r\nto the ground, and spin their cocoons among dead leaves.\r\n\r\nTwo only of this family can receive an individual notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Oak Hook Tip_ (_Drepana binaria_)\r\n\r\nThis can hardly be described as a very common moth, but it is fairly\r\nplentiful in the woods of the southern counties of England.\r\n\r\nIts wings are yellowish brown, marked with two lighter transverse lines.\r\nThere are two black spots between the lines of the fore wings. The\r\nantennae of the male are pectinated; those of the female simple. The\r\nlatter sex is further distinguished by the paler colour of the hind\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--THE OAK HOOK TIP.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is brown, with a broad stripe, edged with yellow, down the\r\nback. There are two projections on the back of the fourth segment. It\r\nfeeds on oak (_Quercus Robur_) and birch (_Betula alba_).\r\n\r\nThis moth is double-brooded, and may be seen on the wing in June and\r\nAugust. The larva may be beaten from the above-mentioned trees in June\r\nand July, and again in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chinese Character_ (_Cilix glaucata_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are white, with a broad dark blotch from\r\nthe inner margin to near the costa. The central portion of this blotch\r\nis marked with silvery spots which are said to resemble Chinese\r\ncharacters. The hind margin is shaded with a dark grey border, inside\r\nwhich is a row of dark spots. The hind wings are clouded with grey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--THE CHINESE CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is widely distributed, and seems to be common throughout\r\nEngland. It is double brooded, the first brood appearing in May and\r\nJune, and the second in August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, which is brown, with two prominent tubercles on each of\r\nthe third and fourth segments, feeds on the whitethorn (_Crataegus\r\noxyacantha_), and the blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--DICRANURIDAE\r\n\r\nThe five British species that represent this family are such interesting\r\ninsects that we should like to have given a detailed description of all\r\nof them, but our limited space will allow of no more than an outline of\r\nthe general characteristics of the group and a selection of two for\r\nindividual mention.\r\n\r\nThey are thick-bodied moths, and the prevailing colours are white and\r\nshades of grey. The antennae are pectinated in the males, and, with the\r\nexception of the Lobster Moth (_Fagi_), in the females also.\r\n\r\nThe larvae, like those of the last family, have no anal claspers, and\r\nstand, when at rest, with both ends of the body raised. They have two\r\n'tails' projecting from the last segment. The largest of them (the\r\nPuss), and three smaller species (Kittens) that closely resemble it in\r\nhabits, all construct hard cocoons to be presently described; but the\r\nlarva of the Lobster Moth spins a light cocoon among the leaves of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThey all spend the winter in the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Poplar Kitten_ (_Dicranura bifida_)\r\n\r\nOur illustration shows the arrangement of the white and grey on the\r\nwings of this moth, but the other Kittens (_Bicuspis_ and _Furcula_) so\r\nclosely resemble it that it is necessary to point out a mark of\r\ndistinction. It will be observed that the fore wings are crossed by a\r\nbroad grey band, edged with black. This band, in the present species, is\r\nalmost of the same width throughout, its interior margin being almost\r\nstraight, and the exterior one slightly concave. In _Furcula_, the outer\r\nmargin of the band is generally sharply bent inward just below the\r\ncosta. In _Bicuspis_ the grey band varies considerably in shape, but\r\nboth this and the dark blotch near the tip of the wing are more sharply\r\ndefined than in the other two species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--THE POPLAR KITTEN.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, dotted with brown, and has a brown stripe on\r\nthe back. This stripe is broken on the third segment, and widens out on\r\nthe eighth and thirteenth segments. It feeds on the Poplar (_Populus\r\nnigra_) and Aspen (_P. tremula_).\r\n\r\nWhen full grown it descends to the trunk of the tree, and constructs a\r\nvery hard cocoon of a glutinous substance from its own body mingled with\r\nlittle pieces of the bark that it removes for the purpose. Thus made,\r\nthe cocoon so closely resembles the surrounding bark that detection is\r\nvery difficult. I have frequently found these cocoons on the inner\r\nsurface of loose bark.\r\n\r\nThis moth is widely distributed, and may be searched for in June and\r\nJuly. The larva feeds during August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Puss_ (_Dicranura vinula_)\r\n\r\nNo written description is necessary in this case, the illustration\r\neasily serving for identification. This beautiful moth flies in May and\r\nJune, and is common everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--THE PUSS MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is a very interesting creature. It is green, with a hump\r\non the fourth segment, and a patch of brown from the fourth segment to\r\nthe tail. This patch is very wide on the eighth segment, but tapers to a\r\npoint on the thirteenth. The two horns are rather long and rough, and\r\nfrom each of them a very slender pink filament is protruded when the\r\ncaterpillar is irritated.\r\n\r\nIt constructs a cocoon very similar to that of _Bifida_, though of\r\ncourse larger, on the bark of the tree on which it fed, generally three\r\nor four feet from the ground. It feeds on sallows, willows, and poplars,\r\nand may be found during July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--NOTODONTIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Coxcomb Prominent_ (_Lophopteryx camelina_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Notodontidae_ contains several moths of somewhat varied\r\nappearance, but foremost among them are the 'Prominents,' distinguished\r\nby a conspicuous projection on the inner margin of the fore wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--THE COXCOMB PROMINENT.]\r\n\r\nOur example of this group is the Coxcomb Prominent.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are brown, with darker markings arranged as shown in the\r\nillustration; and the hind margins are scalloped. The hind wings are\r\nmuch paler, with a dark brown patch in the anal angle.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with a yellowish line on each side. The\r\nspiracles are black, and there are two small humps on the twelfth\r\nsegment. It feeds during August, September, and October, on various\r\ntrees, including the oak, birch, poplar, hazel, and alder.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies from June to August, and is moderately common and widely\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--PYGAERIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Buff Tip_ (_Phalera bucephala_)\r\n\r\nThe first of our two examples of this small family is the common and\r\ndestructive Buff Tip. The perfect insect is represented on Plate X, fig.\r\n9, and is too well known to require a lengthy description. During June\r\nand July it may be seen resting on the bark of trees almost everywhere,\r\nwith its wings folded closely round its body, and its antennae tucked\r\nunder the wings, looking just like a piece of stick, or a projection of\r\nthe bark on which it sits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--THE LARVA OF BUCEPHALA.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars appear towards the end of June, and may be seen in\r\ndense clusters on lime and other trees, sometimes twenty or thirty\r\nhuddled together on a single leaf. As they grow larger they retain their\r\ngregarious tendencies, and often completely strip the leaves from large\r\nbranches. They are of a dull yellow colour, hairy, and have seven broken\r\nblack lines, one along the middle of the back, and three on each side.\r\nThe head and legs are black.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown, they descend to the root of the tree, burrow into the\r\nsoil, and there remain in the chrysalis state till the following June.\r\nThe chief food plants of this species are the lime (_Tilia vulgaris_),\r\nelm (_Ulmus campestris_), and hazel (_Corylus Avellana_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chocolate Tip_ (_Pygaera curtula_)\r\n\r\nThis species is not nearly so common as the last, but is to be met with\r\nmore or less in most of the English counties in the month of May.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are light greyish brown, crossed with four transverse\r\npaler streaks, and tipped with a patch of chocolate brown. The hind\r\nwings are pale yellowish grey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--THE CHOCOLATE TIP.]\r\n\r\nThe young caterpillars feed in companies between leaves which they have\r\nspun together, but when nearly full grown they cease to be gregarious.\r\nThey are also very different in appearance at different ages. When fully\r\nfed, the larva is of a reddish-grey colour, spotted with black, with a\r\ndouble row of orange-coloured warts on each side. There is also a little\r\nblack hump on each of the fifth and twelfth segments.\r\n\r\nThe food plants of this species are sallows (_Salix caprea_ and _S.\r\ncinerea_), poplar (_Populus nigra_), and aspen (_P. tremula_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--CYMATOPHORIDAE\r\n\r\nThis, the last family of the _Bombyces_, contains seven species of\r\nmoderate size, the larvae of which are either quite smooth or have small\r\nwarty prominences. The seven species are grouped into three genera, from\r\ntwo of which we shall select a representative.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peach Blossom_ (_Thyatira Batis_)\r\n\r\nThe popular name of this pretty little moth is given on account of the\r\nresemblance of the pink patches of its olive-brown fore wings to the\r\npetals of the peach flower. It is a moderately common moth, widely\r\ndistributed in England and Ireland, and flies during June and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--THE PEACH BLOSSOM.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is marbled with reddish grey and brown, and has a hump\r\non the third segment, and a smaller prominence on each of the segments\r\nsix to ten inclusive. It feeds on the bramble (_Rubus fruticosus_)\r\nduring August and September, and spends the winter in the chrysalis\r\nstate, inclosed in a loose cocoon among the dead leaves at the root of\r\nits food plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Yellow-horned_ (_Asphalia flavicornis_)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the earliest of our moths, appearing on the wing in\r\nMarch, when it may be attracted by means of sugar placed on the bark of\r\nthe birch (_Betula alba_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--THE YELLOW-HORNED.]\r\n\r\nThe wings are grey, with a decidedly greenish tinge, crossed by three\r\ndark lines near the base, and two others, which are zigzag, just outside\r\nthe centre. Between these two sets of lines is a conspicuous round pale\r\nspot. The hind wings are greyish brown, darker along the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThe larva, which feeds on the above-named tree, is pale greenish, with\r\nboth white and black dots. It rolls itself up in a leaf, and seldom\r\nventures out of the retreat thus formed. It is fully fed in July or\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_THE NOCTUAE_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed that several of our moths fly by day; that some\r\ncome out of their hiding places at dusk, and settle down again to rest\r\nbefore the deepest shadows of night fall; and that others prefer the\r\ndarkest hours of the night. The tribe of moths we are next to consider\r\nincludes the greater number (about three hundred) of our truly nocturnal\r\nspecies, hence the name that heads this chapter.\r\n\r\nThey are generally of a somewhat dingy appearance, the prevailing\r\ncolours being dull shades of grey, drab, and brown. So closely, in fact,\r\ndo certain of them resemble each other, that the greatest care has to be\r\nexercised in the identification of species--a task that is rendered\r\nstill more difficult by the variations that we observe in the tints and\r\nmarkings of certain species.\r\n\r\nThese moths have generally rather stout bodies. Their fore wings are\r\nsomewhat narrow, and, when the insects are at rest, these are brought\r\nclose to the body, and the hind pair are folded up beneath them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--BRYOPHILIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Marbled Beauty_ (_Bryophila Perla_)\r\n\r\nOur first family--the _Bryophilidae_--contains only four British species.\r\nThese are small and slender-bodied moths, whose larvae feed in early\r\nmorning on the lichens that cover stones and old walls, and conceal\r\nthemselves by day in holes and chinks and under stones.\r\n\r\nThe Marbled Beauty is the only moth of this family that may be\r\ndescribed as common with us. It is abundant in nearly every English\r\ncounty, as well as in parts of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--THE MARBLED BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\nIts wings are very pale grey, marked with a darker bluish grey, as shown\r\nin the engraving. These markings are variable, but the bases of the fore\r\nwings have always a dark blotch, followed by a patch of pale grey or\r\nwhite, extending the whole width of the wing. The moth may be found from\r\nthe beginning of July to the middle of September.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds from February to April. It is black above, with a broad\r\norange-bordered stripe down the back; and its body is covered with small\r\nwarts, each of which bears a single hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--BOMBYCOIDAE\r\n\r\nIn this family there are sixteen British moths, several of which are\r\nexceedingly common. They are much larger than the _Bryophilidae_, and of\r\na much stouter build. The larvae are covered with little hair-bearing\r\nwarts, and are, indeed, often so hairy that they may be mistaken for the\r\ncaterpillars of the _Bombyces_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grey Dagger_ (_Acronycta Psi_)\r\n\r\nThis is the commonest of all the _Bombycoidae_. It may be found at rest\r\non tree trunks and palings during the daytime throughout the summer. Its\r\nfore wings are pale grey, with four conspicuous black marks, one of\r\nwhich--that in the anal angle--resembles the Greek letter _psi_ ([psi])\r\nplaced sideways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--THE GREY DAGGER.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is black or very dark grey, with a pale yellow line down the\r\nback, and a black hump on each of the fifth and twelfth segments, that\r\non the fifth being much larger than the other. It feeds in the autumn on\r\nlime (_Tilia vulgaris_), blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), whitethorn\r\n(_Crataegus oxyacantha_), fruit trees, and various other trees, shrubs,\r\nand herbs.\r\n\r\nThe moth called the Dark Dagger (_Tridens_) is hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from _Psi_. It is not really any darker, and its markings\r\nare almost exactly similar; but the larva is very different.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Poplar Grey_ (_Acronycta megacephala_)\r\n\r\nThis is also a very common moth, to be found in all the southern and\r\nmidland counties, wherever poplars abound, during June and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--THE POPLAR GREY.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are grey, marbled with a very dark grey. A little inside\r\nthe middle of these wings, near the costa, is a round spot with a dark\r\ncentre. This spot is represented in a large number of the _Noctuae_, and\r\nis known as the _orbicular_. It will be observed that in the present\r\nspecies it is very distinct.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dark grey, with a line of black dots down the back;\r\nand it has a number of little warts, bearing hairs. On the back of the\r\neleventh segment is a rather large pale spot. It feeds during August on\r\nvarious species of poplar, and changes to a chrysalis in a crevice of\r\nthe bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Figure of Eight_ (_Diloba caeruleocephala_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are brownish grey. Near the middle of the wing, but\r\nnearer the costa than the inner margin, are two whitish spots that\r\nresemble the figure 8. The hind wings are dull brownish grey, with\r\ndarker wing rays, and a dark spot near the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--THE FIGURE OF EIGHT.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is common in all parts, and flies during September.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar emerges from the egg in spring, and is fully grown in\r\nMay or June. It is of a very pale colour--yellowish or greenish--with a\r\nbroad and broken yellow stripe down the back, and a bluish or greenish\r\nstripe on each side. Its head is blue (hence the specific name) with two\r\nblack spots. It feeds on the hawthorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_) and\r\nvarious fruit trees; and on the twigs of these (especially the hawthorn)\r\nthe little clusters of eggs may be seen during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--LEUCANIIDAE\r\n\r\nIn this family we have a number of rather small moths, with, generally,\r\nno markings on their wings, save, perhaps, a few dots or streaks.\r\n\r\nTheir larvae feed principally on grasses and reeds, and change to the\r\nchrysalis state either in a cocoon among the food plants, or under the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these insects are very common, and most of them abound in\r\nfens and marshes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brown-line Bright-eye_ (_Leucania conigera_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are yellowish brown. The 'brown line' is a transverse\r\nline parallel with the hind margin, and distant from it about one-fourth\r\nthe length of the wing. Another dark brown line, describing a sharp\r\nbend, passes across the wing near the base. The 'bright eye' is a light\r\nspot just outside the centre of the wing, nearer the costa than the\r\ninner margin. This is another of those marks that occur very constantly\r\nin the wings of the _Noctuae_. It lies beyond the _orbicular_ spot, and\r\nis usually somewhat kidney-shaped, and is consequently named the\r\n_reniform_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--THE BROWN-LINE BRIGHT-EYE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is yellowish or greyish, with a pale dorsal line edged\r\nwith black. On each side of this is a broad black line, below which is a\r\nyellow line edged with black, then a whitish stripe, next a yellow line\r\nedged with black on the upper side, and lastly a broad brownish line,\r\njust above the spiracles, edged with black on both sides. It feeds on\r\ncouch grass (_Agropyron repens_) and various other grasses, and is fully\r\ngrown in May.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in July and August, and is common throughout the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Smoky Wainscot_ (_Leucania impura_)\r\n\r\nThis same genus includes a number of moths, very similar in general\r\nappearance, and popularly known as the 'Wainscots.' Of these we shall\r\ntake two examples.\r\n\r\nThe first is the Smoky Wainscot, so called from the dark smoky tint of\r\nthe hind wings. Its fore wings are wainscot brown, with lighter rays;\r\nand they each have three black dots arranged in the form of a triangle,\r\none in the centre, and the other two between this and the hind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--THE SMOKY WAINSCOT.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is yellowish, with a fine white line down the back. The\r\nspiracles are red, and inclosed in black rings. It feeds on sedges\r\n(_Carex_) from March to May.\r\n\r\nThe moth is on the wing from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Wainscot_ (_Leucania pallens_)\r\n\r\nThis moth is very much like the last. The fore wings exhibit the same\r\nthree dots, but it may be distinguished by the pale colour of the hind\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--THE COMMON WAINSCOT.]\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on various grasses in March and April. It is of a\r\npinkish grey colour, with two rows of black dots on each side of the\r\ndorsal line. There are also three stripes along the side, two of which\r\nare brownish and the other grey.\r\n\r\nThe moth is common everywhere from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bullrush_ (_Nonagria arundinis_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of this family is the Bullrush, a moth that is common\r\nin all parts where its food plant abounds.\r\n\r\nIt is much larger than the two preceding species. The fore wings are\r\nyellowish brown, with three parallel transverse lines of black spots.\r\nThe hind wings are whitish, tinged with brown near the hind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--THE BULLRUSH.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a dull pinkish colour, with a shining brownish\r\nplate on the second segment. The spiracles are black. It feeds inside\r\nthe stems of the reed-mace (_Typha latifolia_), and changes to a\r\nchrysalis within the gallery it has excavated, after making a hole\r\nthrough which it can escape when it attains the perfect form.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar may be found in May and June, the chrysalis in August,\r\nand the moth in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--APAMEIDAE\r\n\r\nThis large family contains no less than forty-four British species, many\r\nof which are exceedingly common; and of the others only about half a\r\ndozen can be regarded as rare.\r\n\r\nMost of them are of medium size, and with one or two exceptions are\r\ndressed in rather dingy garbs; but, although the ground colours are\r\ndull, the various markings of the wings are sharply defined. They may be\r\nsearched for on palings and the bark of trees by day, at which time they\r\nrepose with their wings sloping like the sides of the roof of a house.\r\nSome are easily attracted by lights, and others partake freely of the\r\nentomologist's 'sugar.'\r\n\r\nThe larvae have small retractile heads, and feed on low-growing plants,\r\nkeeping themselves well concealed on the lower leaves close to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Frosted Orange_ (_Gortyna Ochracea_)\r\n\r\nWe commence with one of the brightest members of the family, the Frosted\r\nOrange. Its fore wings are dark yellow or ochreous, with distinct brown\r\nmarkings, the chief of which are two broad transverse bands. The\r\norbicular spot is pale yellow and very distinct. The hind wings are\r\ndingy yellow. This moth flies from July to September, and is easily\r\nattracted by a light at night. It is common everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--THE FROSTED ORANGE.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is yellow, dotted with black, with a brownish plate on the\r\nsecond segment. It feeds inside the stems of a number of plants,\r\nincluding the marsh thistle (_Cnicus palustris_), musk thistle (_Carduus\r\nnutans_), burdock (_Arctium minus_), mullein (_Verbascum thapsus_),\r\nfoxglove (_Digitalis purpurea_), and elder (_Sambucus nigra_). When\r\nabout to change to the chrysalis it eats _nearly_ to the surface of the\r\nstem, leaving only a very thin and transparent layer of the epidermis to\r\ncover the hole through which it is to escape when it becomes a moth.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are to be found in June, and the chrysalides in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Flame_ (_Axylia putris_)\r\n\r\nThis also is a pretty insect, but much smaller than _Ochracea_. It is\r\ncommon in most parts, and may be seen flying in weedy and waste grounds\r\nat dusk during June and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--THE FLAME.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are pale pinkish brown, with dark brown along the costa,\r\nand two patches of the same colour on the hind margin. There is also a\r\ndouble line of small brown dots parallel with the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThe larva is brown, with one yellow and two white dots on each segment.\r\nThere is also a triangular dark patch on each of the fifth and sixth\r\nsegments. It feeds during August on the stinging nettle (_Urtica\r\ndioica_), and various other low herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Light Arches_ (_Xylophasia lithoxylea_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are very light ochreous, with a light\r\nbrown patch on the middle of the costa, and patches of the same colour\r\nalong the hind margin; also a row of small black dots parallel with the\r\nsame margin. The hind wings are pale ochreous: they are brownish along\r\nthe hind margin, and have a light fringe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--THE LIGHT ARCHES.]\r\n\r\nThe moth is very common in waste places, and flies in June and July.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a dirty white colour, dotted with black, and has a\r\nblack head. It feeds on the roots of grasses in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Flounced Rustic_ (_Luperina testacea_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are greyish brown, with darker umber-brown markings.\r\nThese latter are variable, but the most conspicuous is a series of dark\r\ncrescent-shaped spots almost parallel with the hind margin, and\r\nimmediately outside these is a series of paler crescents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--THE FLOUNCED RUSTIC.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dull flesh-colour, with a brown head, and a brownish\r\nplate on the second segment. It feeds on the stems of grasses.\r\n\r\nThe moth is common throughout the British Isles, and flies in August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cabbage Moth_ (_Mamestra Brassicae_)\r\n\r\nWhatever be your methods of moth collecting, you are sure to meet with\r\n_Brassicae_ in abundance. They swarm round the insect hunter's sugar in\r\nsuch numbers as to become a positive nuisance. They are also attracted\r\nby light. During the day they may be seen at rest on palings. The\r\ncaterpillar is even better known, and with reason, for it is fearfully\r\ndestructive to our vegetables and even our flower beds. It burrows into\r\nthe hearts of cabbages, filling the galleries it makes with its\r\nexcrement, often leaving no very visible outward signs of its presence\r\nwithin. But its ravages are by no means confined to cabbages. It eats\r\nwith more or less relish almost every vegetable and flowering plant of\r\nour gardens, and is equally partial to the various herbs of the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--THE CABBAGE MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the moth are dingy brownish grey, marbled in a very\r\nconfused manner by darker markings. The _reniform_ spot is very\r\ndistinct, the orbicular less so. A light zigzag line runs parallel with\r\nthe hind margin. It flies in June and July.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds later in the season, and changes to the chrysalis\r\nbeneath the soil in the autumn. It is of a dark grey colour, with a\r\ndarker line on the back, and a lighter one along the spiracles, which\r\nare white.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dot_ (_Mamestra Persicariae_)\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous white reniform spot on the very dark marbled fore wings\r\nis always sufficient for the identification of this species.\r\n\r\nThis moth is out in June and July; and during the latter month lays its\r\neggs on the elder (_Sambucus nigra_), and the various low plants that\r\nsupply the larva with food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--THE DOT.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is greenish or greyish, sometimes with a reddish tinge, with a\r\nlight line down the back. The twelfth segment is humped, and there are\r\ndark V-shaped marks on the back of segments five to twelve inclusive. It\r\nis full grown in September, and burrows into the ground to undergo its\r\nchange to the chrysalis, in which state it remains throughout the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rustic Shoulder-knot_ (_Apamea basilinea_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are pale ochreous grey, with light brown\r\nmarkings; and there is a short dark streak in the middle of the base,\r\nfrom which feature the specific name (_Basilinea_) is derived. The hind\r\nwings are of a similar colour, but shading into a dark smoke colour at\r\nthe hind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--THE RUSTIC SHOULDER KNOT.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars feed at first on the grains of wheat, on the ears of\r\nwhich the moth deposits the eggs in June. At harvest time they remain\r\nhidden among the husks, and are often threshed out in large numbers by\r\nthe blows of the flail. The cold weather soon overtakes them, and they\r\nthen spin a cocoon in which to pass the winter. On the approach of\r\nspring they come out again, and feed by night on various low plants,\r\nhiding themselves among the roots by day. In March they are full grown,\r\nand change to brown chrysalides beneath the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in June, and is one of the commonest and most destructive\r\nof our _Noctuae_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marbled Minor_ (_Miana strigilis_)\r\n\r\nThe next three genera (_Miana_, _Phothedes_, and _Celaena_) include seven\r\nsmall moths known as the 'Minors.' The commonest of them is the Marbled\r\nMinor, which is to be found in abundance everywhere during June and\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--THE MARBLED MINOR.]\r\n\r\nThis species is very variable, but the fore wings are usually dark\r\nbrown, marbled with a lighter colour--white or grey. There is generally\r\nan irregular white or pale grey band crossing the wings parallel with\r\nthe hind margin, and two white marks on the inner margin, halfway\r\nbetween this band and the base. There is also a deep black blotch across\r\nthe middle of the wing.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is greyish or greenish with paler lines and black\r\nspiracles. It feeds on grasses in March and April, and changes to a\r\nchrysalis under the ground in May.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--CARADRINIDAE\r\n\r\nThere are only ten British species in this family, two of which are\r\nrare; and most of the others are particularly dingy. The transverse\r\nlines so often seen on the fore wings of Noctuae are generally well\r\nmarked. The larvae have short stiff bristles, and feed on low plants;\r\nthey undergo their changes in an earthen cocoon under the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mottled Rustic_ (_Caradrina Morpheus_)\r\n\r\nWe select as our type of this family the Mottled Rustic--a common moth\r\nthat may be procured from June to August. Its fore wings are brownish\r\ngrey, with darker lines and spots; the hind wings are almost white, but\r\ndarker at the tip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--THE MOTTLED RUSTIC.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is brownish grey, with a row of triangular spots on each\r\nside of the back. It is very sluggish, spending the greater part of its\r\nexistence among the roots of low plants. It feeds throughout the winter,\r\nexcept during severe weather, and is full grown in April. The food\r\nplants include teasels (_Dipsacus pilosus_ and _D. sylvestris_), hedge\r\nbedstraw (_Galium Mollugo_), orpine (_Sedum Telephium_), sallows\r\n(_Salix_), and various other plants.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis may be dug out in May.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--NOCTUIDAE\r\n\r\nA glance at our list of British _Noctuae_ (Appendix I) will show that\r\nthis family contains nearly fifty species and only three genera. It\r\nincludes several very common moths that frequent our gardens and are to\r\nbe met with during almost every summer evening ramble.\r\n\r\nMost of the species are very dingy, but the half-dozen that comprise the\r\ngenus _Triphaena_ are characterised by the bright colouring of the hind\r\nwings. The fore wings are narrow and more or less glossy, and overlap to\r\na greater or less extent when the insects are at rest; and the hind\r\nwings are folded and completely hidden beneath them.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are rather thick and smooth, and generally of very dingy\r\ncolours. They feed on low plants, often confining their ravages to the\r\nroots, and generally lie well concealed close to the ground or under the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe pupae are brown, smooth, and shining, and are usually inclosed in\r\nearthen cocoons.\r\n\r\nWe shall briefly notice a few members of each of the three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Turnip Moth_ (_Agrotis Segetum_)\r\n\r\nThis is another of those destructive insects that attack vegetable and\r\nflower gardens, often doing so much damage to our crops as to become\r\nquite a nuisance to cultivators.\r\n\r\nThe moth is decidedly dingy. Its fore wings are brown, clouded with a\r\ndarker tint. The hind wings are almost white, sometimes with a brown\r\nhind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--THE TURNIP MOTH.]\r\n\r\nIn June it lays its eggs on the stems of young plants, generally very\r\nclose to the ground. As soon as the young caterpillars emerge they\r\ncommence feeding on the lower parts of the stems, or burrowing deeply\r\ninto the larger succulent roots. When the larvae have completed their\r\nwork of destruction in this way, they change to brown chrysalides in the\r\nground. Some undergo this change in October, and shortly after give rise\r\nto a second brood of moths; but most of them remain in the caterpillar\r\nstate throughout the winter, and, contrary to the general rule with\r\nhybernating larvae, continue to feed almost throughout the winter months,\r\nand change to the chrysalis in the following May.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar grows to a large size. It is of a greyish or greenish\r\ncolour, with a paler line on the back, a light brown line on each side\r\nof this, black spots between these lines, and black spiracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Heart and Dart_ (_Agrotis Exclamationis_)\r\n\r\nThe destructive work of _Segetum_ is assisted by similar operations of\r\nthe Heart and Dart, the larva of which feeds voraciously on the roots of\r\nseveral of our cultivated vegetables, though the present species does\r\nnot entirely confine its ravages to the farmer's crops, but attacks the\r\nroots of many low-growing herbs.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the moth are light brown, generally with a reddish\r\ntinge. The darker markings include a large and very distinct reniform\r\nspot, a less distinct orbicular, and a conspicuous longitudinal blackish\r\nstreak near the base of the wing known as the _claviform_. Beyond the\r\nreniform a curved and zigzag dark line crosses the wing. The hind wings\r\nof the male are very pale, those of the female darker, with a whitish\r\nfringe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--THE HEART AND DART.]\r\n\r\nThe moth flies from June to August, and is common everywhere. The\r\ncaterpillar feeds in the autumn, and reaches its full size in October;\r\nbut it is said to feed at intervals throughout the winter. Its colour is\r\ndingy brown or grey, with paler lines on the sides. The spiracles are\r\nblack, and there are black dots on the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Garden Dart_ (_Agrotis nigricans_)\r\n\r\nThis is another dingy moth, whose general appearance is so unattractive\r\nthat the tyro might be inclined to neglect it. But it must not be\r\nomitted from our selection on that score, for our main object here is to\r\ngive the beginner an acquaintance with those species that are most\r\nlikely to be captured in the earlier part of his career, and this moth\r\nis certainly one of those that may be described as 'abundant\r\neverywhere.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--THE GARDEN DART.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are dull dark brown, often tinged with red, and clouded\r\nwith black. The reniform spot is pale, the orbicular spot less distinct,\r\nand between the two there is generally a rhomboidal dark spot. There is\r\nalso a short dark streak near the base of the wing, and a black spot\r\nbefore the orbicular. The hind wings are pale, but smoky towards the\r\nhind margin.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is brown and shining, with a fine pale line on the back,\r\nand a double white stripe below the spiracles. It is also dotted with\r\nblack. It is exceedingly destructive, feeding on clovers (_Trifolium\r\npratense_ and _T. repens_) and various low plants in May and June.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Flame Shoulder_ (_Noctua plecta_)\r\n\r\nAs our example of the next genus we take the Flame Shoulder, a rather\r\nsmall moth, easily identified by the broad yellowish-white streak along\r\nthe costa of the reddish-brown fore wings. The orbicular and reniform\r\nspots are margined with white, and a thin white streak runs from the\r\nbase of the wing to the former. The hind wings are white. This moth\r\nflies in July, and is common throughout Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--THE FLAME SHOULDER.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is reddish brown, with a slender line of white dots on\r\nthe back, and a similar line on each side. The body is smooth and\r\nvelvety, and is netted and dotted all over with dark brown. It feeds on\r\nthe lady's bedstraw (_Galium verum_), sweet woodruff (_Asperula\r\nodorata_), and many other low plants; and is full fed early in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lesser Broad Border_ (_Triphaena ianthina_)\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third and last genus (_Triphaena_) of this extensive\r\nfamily, a genus which includes six interesting moths, with bright orange\r\nor yellow hind wings. Of these we shall take three examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--THE LESSER BROAD BORDER.]\r\n\r\nThe first of them--the Lesser Broad Border--has fore wings of a rich\r\nreddish or violet brown, with paler markings. The hind wings are bright\r\norange, with a broad marginal band of black.\r\n\r\nIt is a common moth, particularly in the south-western counties, and\r\nflies during July and August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a dingy yellowish or greenish grey, with a light\r\nline down the back, and two black spots on each side of segments nine to\r\ntwelve inclusive. It feeds throughout the winter by night on dead\r\nnettles (_Lamium purpureum_ and _L. album_), primrose (_Primula\r\nacaulis_), whitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_), blackthorn (_Prunus\r\nspinosa_), and various low plants; and may sometimes be seen in flower\r\ngardens. It is full grown in April.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lesser Yellow Underwing_ (_Triphaena Comes_)\r\n\r\nThis insect is very similar to the last, but is larger. The fore wings\r\nare also of a greyish or ochreous brown, and the black margin of the\r\nhind wings is proportionately narrower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--THE LESSER YELLOW UNDERWING.]\r\n\r\nIt is more abundant than _Ianthina_; in fact it is to be found\r\neverywhere in plenty during the month of July.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is yellowish brown. On the back of each of the eleventh\r\nand twelfth segments are two conspicuous dark marks. The spiracles are\r\nwhite, and below them is a pale brown stripe. It feeds on the foxglove\r\n(_Digitalis purpurea_), chickweed (_Stellaria media_), thrift (_Armeria\r\nmaritima_), and other low plants in the autumn, hybernates during the\r\nwinter, and attacks sallows (_Salix Caprea_ and _S. cinerea_) and\r\nwhitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_) as soon as the buds appear in the\r\nspring. It is full grown in April, and then changes to a chrysalis on\r\nthe surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Yellow Underwing_ (_Triphaena Pronuba_)\r\n\r\nThis is by far the commonest moth of the genus, and may be found\r\neverywhere, in town and country, from June to August. It is represented\r\non Plate XI (fig. 1), but its fore wings are very variable, sometimes a\r\ncold dingy grey, but often of an exceedingly rich and warm brown. On the\r\ncostal margin, not far from the tip, there is always a small black spot,\r\nwhich will serve to distinguish it from _Comes_.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar (fig. 21) feeds throughout the winter on the roots of\r\nalmost every plant in our gardens; and, during the warmer weather of the\r\nautumn and spring, on stems and leaves. It is full grown early in the\r\nsummer, and then changes to a chrysalis in the ground. Its colour is\r\ndirty yellowish or greenish grey, with a row of dark spots on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--AMPHIPYRIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Gothic_ (_Mania typica_)\r\n\r\nThe above family contains only four British species, two of which we\r\nshall briefly consider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--THE GOTHIC.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the Gothic--a very common moth that may be seen\r\neverywhere about midsummer. Its fore wings are brown with darker\r\nmarblings, and there are numerous lighter markings which may be easily\r\nmade out by reference to the accompanying woodcut.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is smooth and velvety, of a dull brown or greenish\r\ncolour, with darker dorsal and side stripes. The latter are crossed\r\nobliquely by a series of whitish lines. It feeds on fruit and other\r\ntrees in clusters when very young in early autumn, and afterwards\r\ndescends and feeds on low plants. It hybernates in the winter, and feeds\r\nagain on low plants in the spring. When full grown it burrows into the\r\nsoil to undergo its changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Old Lady_ (_Mania Maura_)\r\n\r\nThis fine moth is so very different from the last in appearance that the\r\nreason for placing the two in the same genus is not apparent till the\r\nearlier stages and life history have been studied. All its wings are\r\nvery deep brown; the front pair has a darker band containing the\r\norbicular and reniform spots, and the hind pair a lighter band across\r\nthe middle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--THE OLD LADY.]\r\n\r\nIt is a common moth, often to be found at rest by day in outhouses and\r\nsheds. It flies in July and August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dark purple or umber brown, with darker and lighter\r\nmarkings. It feeds in the autumn on fruit trees, and hybernates during\r\nthe winter. In the spring it feeds again on low plants, and changes to a\r\nchrysalis in May under the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ORTHOSIIDAE\r\n\r\nThis is a large family of over thirty species, most of them of rather\r\nsmall size, which make their appearance, with two exceptions, either in\r\nearly spring or in late autumn, often attracted in the former season by\r\nthe sallow blossom, and in the latter by ivy bloom.\r\n\r\nSeveral of them are very common insects, that are almost sure to be\r\ntaken by a young collector during his first season.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of these moths are more or less pointed at the tip, and\r\nthe usual lines and spots are generally distinct. The males may be\r\ndistinguished from the females by their antennae, which are always more\r\nor less ciliated.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are smooth and velvety, and feed by night; and the pupae\r\nare inclosed in cocoons constructed of earth and silk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Quaker_ (_Taeniocampa stabilis_)\r\n\r\nSeveral of the species of the family are known popularly as Quakers, the\r\ncommonest of which--_Stabilis_--is abundant in all parts.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are grey, with generally either an ochreous or reddish\r\ntinge. The orbicular and reniform spots are outlined with a paler\r\ncolour, and there is a pale transverse line parallel with the hind\r\nmargin, outside which is a row of indistinct black spots. The hind wings\r\nare greyish brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--THE COMMON QUAKER.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green and velvety, with a yellowish line on the back\r\nand on each side; and a yellow band crosses the back of the twelfth\r\nsegment transversely. It feeds during June and July on oak (_Quercus\r\nRobur_) and elm (_Ulmus campestris_), and changes to a chrysalis in\r\nAugust on the surface of the ground. In this state it remains throughout\r\nthe winter, and the moth emerges in March or April.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chestnut_ (_Cerastis Vaccinii_)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately our space will not allow us to notice the whole of even\r\nthe very common moths, so, passing over a few with great reluctance, we\r\ncome to the familiar Chestnut, which may be seen at large in October and\r\nNovember, and sometimes even in December, and again appears, after a\r\nrather short period of hybernation, in February and March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--THE CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are reddish brown, with darker wavy lines. The orbicular\r\nand reniform spots have pale outlines, and the lower half of the latter\r\nis very dark grey. The hind wings are smoky grey, with generally a pale\r\nband beyond the middle.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dark brown, with very indistinct lighter lines. The\r\nspiracles are black, and inclosed in a yellowish grey stripe. It feeds\r\nduring June and July on the elm (_Ulmus campestris_), oak (_Quercus\r\nRobur_), and sallow (_Salix caprea_), and various low plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pink-barred Sallow_ (_Xanthia Flavago_)\r\n\r\nThis moth is not nearly so common as the preceding species, but has been\r\ntaken more or less in all parts of England.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are orange yellow, with purplish markings arranged as\r\nrepresented in fig. 165. The hind wings are yellowish white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--THE PINK-BARRED SALLOW.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is brown, with a lateral stripe formed by numerous red,\r\nyellow and white dots. It feeds on sallow (_Salix caprea_) and various\r\nlow plants.\r\n\r\nIt is full grown in June, and the moth appears in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--COSMIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Dun-bar_ (_Calymnia trapezina_)\r\n\r\nOur example of this family is the Dun-bar, common everywhere during July\r\nand August.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are greyish ochreous, with a darker band across the\r\nmiddle. On each side of this band is a white line margined with dark\r\ngrey, and there is a row of black spots along the hind margin. The hind\r\nwings are smoky brown, becoming paler towards the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--THE DUN-BAR.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on oak (_Quercus Robur_), hornbeam (_Carpinus\r\nBetulus_), and birch (_Betula alba_), and may be found in abundance\r\nduring May and June. It is green, with dark spots, and white lines on\r\nthe back and sides. Although it partakes of the leaves of the\r\nabove-named trees, yet its chief food seems to be other caterpillars,\r\nfor it devours these with a savage greediness that is simply\r\nastonishing. It will chase an unfortunate caterpillar, seize it by the\r\nneck with a fatal grip, and rapidly devour it. Its chief prey seems to\r\nbe the larva of the Winter Moth (_Brumata_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--HADENIDAE\r\n\r\nNearly fifty British _Noctuae_ are included in the family _Hadenidae_.\r\nThey are of variable dimensions, and differ much in the brightness of\r\ntheir colours, some being very dingy, and others gaily tinted. Their\r\nantennae are rather long; and when at rest the wings slope from the back\r\nlike the sides of a roof.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are smooth, and not very thick; and there is sometimes a hump\r\non the twelfth segment. The pupae are brown and shiny, and are inclosed\r\nin earthen cocoons beneath the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Broad-barred White_ (_Hecatera serena_)\r\n\r\nAlthough not gaily coloured, this is a pretty little moth, there being a\r\nbright contrast between the white ground and the grey markings of the\r\nwings. It is common in the south of England, and seems to be plentiful\r\nin and around London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--THE BROAD-BARRED WHITE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is of a dingy greenish colour, with a yellowish stripe\r\non each side of the back; and there are two distinct dots on the back of\r\neach segment. It feeds during July and August on sow-thistles (_Sonchus\r\noleraceus_ and _S. arvensis_), sleepwort (_Lactuca virosa_), and\r\nhawkweeds (_Hieracia_).\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marvel-du-jour_ (_Agriopis Aprilina_)\r\n\r\nThe Marvel-du-jour is decidedly a beautiful moth--quite an exception\r\namong the _Noctuae_ in this respect, and it is withal both common and\r\nwidely distributed. We need not describe it, since it is represented on\r\nPlate XI (fig. 2), and can hardly be mistaken for any other species.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dull green, often tinged with red. The dorsal line is\r\nbroad and dark, and interrupted by a series of very light lozenge-shaped\r\nspots. It feeds on the oak in May and June, and is full grown in the\r\nlatter month. It then burrows into the earth at the foot of the tree,\r\nand there constructs a fragile earthen cocoon previous to changing to a\r\nchrysalis.\r\n\r\nFrom July to September the chrysalides may be obtained in plenty by\r\nbreaking up the sods at the roots of oaks, and the perfect insect may be\r\nfound toward the end of September and throughout October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Angle Shades_ (_Euplexia lucipara_)\r\n\r\nThis pretty little moth is represented in fig. 3 of Plate XI. It is very\r\ncommon throughout the country, and may be seen in June and July.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is thickest on the twelfth segment, and gradually tapers\r\nfrom this towards the head. Its colour is pale green, with a white\r\nstripe just below the spiracles, which are black. On each side of the\r\nback are a number of oblique lines, which meet in the middle line, thus\r\nforming a series of V-shaped marks pointing towards the tail. It feeds\r\non the common bracken fern (_Pteris aquilina_), foxglove (_Digitalis\r\npurpurea_), and the male fern (_Lastraea Filix-mas_), in August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Angle Shades_ (_Phlogophora Meticulosa_)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--THE ANGLE SHADES.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is so common and so widely distributed that it is almost sure\r\nto be taken by the young collector during his first season. Its wings\r\nare scalloped on the hind margin, and their colour light ochreous, often\r\ntinged with pink or olive green, and marked with dark brown as shown in\r\nthe illustration. It is double brooded, the first brood appearing in May\r\nand June, and the second in September and October.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green or olive brown, and thickly covered with white\r\nspots. It feeds on groundsel (_Senecio vulgaris_) and many other low\r\nplants, the first brood throughout the winter from November to April,\r\nand the second in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grey Arches_ (_Aplecta nebulosa_)\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this moth vary from greyish white to a rather dark\r\nsmoky tint. The markings are of a darker colour, and are also subject to\r\nconsiderable variation. The orbicular and reniform spots are large, and\r\npaler than the ground colour; and several zigzag or scalloped lines,\r\nmore or less distinct, cross the wings transversely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--THE GREY ARCHES.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is brown, with a lighter line down the back. On each of the\r\nsegments five to eleven is a dark lozenge-shaped spot, bisected by the\r\ndorsal line; and on the second segment is a shining plate and a\r\ntriangular mark. It feeds on the dock (_Rumex_), and various other low\r\nplants during the autumn; and, after its hybernation, on the leaves of\r\nthe sallow (_Salix Caprea_), birch (_Betula alba_), and whitethorn\r\n(_Crataegus oxyacantha_). It is full grown in May, when it burrows into\r\nthe ground to undergo its metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies during June and July, and is common in nearly every part\r\nof Great Britain. Large numbers may be obtained by searching fences and\r\ntree trunks about midsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shears_ (_Hadena dentina_)\r\n\r\nThe Shears is another very common moth of the same family. The ground\r\ncolour of the fore wings is very variable, but is generally a lighter or\r\ndarker shade of grey. Sometimes, however, it has a very decided brownish\r\ntinge. Across the centre of the wing is a darker band, wider on the\r\ncostal side, containing the orbicular and reniform spots, as well as a\r\nlight patch beneath them, and bordered on each side by a pale zigzag\r\nline. There is another similar line near to and parallel with the hind\r\nmargin. The hind wings are smoky grey or smoky brown, darker towards the\r\nhind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--THE SHEARS.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is greyish, and has a series of triangular black spots\r\nalong each side of the back. It feeds on the roots of the dandelion\r\n(_Taraxacum officinale_), and changes to a peculiar spiny chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears to be abundant everywhere, and is on the wing\r\nin June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bright-line Brown-eye_ (_Hadena oleracea_)\r\n\r\nEvery collector is sure to meet with this insect during his first\r\nseason. The moth is abundant everywhere in June, the caterpillar may be\r\nfound feeding in almost every waste and weedy spot in August and\r\nSeptember, and the chrysalis is certain to be turned over by the pupa\r\ndigger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--THE BRIGHT-LINE BROWN-EYE.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the perfect insect are reddish brown. The orbicular\r\nspot is usually very indistinct, being of almost exactly the same tint\r\nas the ground colour, and surrounded by a very fine whitish line. The\r\nreniform is generally more conspicuous, a portion of it being of a light\r\nochreous colour. Near the hind margin, and parallel with it, is a white\r\nline, bent sharply into the form of a W, just on the anal side of the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\nThe hind wings are greyish brown in the base, and dark smoke colour\r\ntowards the margin.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green or brown, dotted with both black and\r\nwhite, and adorned with a bright yellow line just below the spiracles.\r\nIt feeds on the nettle (_Urtica dioica_), dock (_Rumex_), and many other\r\nlow plants; and, according to some observers, on the elm (_Ulmus\r\ncampestris_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--XYLINIDAE\r\n\r\nThe next family--_Xylinidae_--contains twenty British species, several of\r\nwhich are local, but two or three are abundant and widely distributed.\r\n\r\nThe transverse lines that so often cross the wings of the _Noctuae_ are\r\nnearly or entirely absent in this family, and longitudinal lines take\r\ntheir place. When the insects are at rest the wings are folded rather\r\nclosely, the outer pair being arranged like a roof with a very gentle\r\nslope. The bodies of the perfect insects are very stout, particularly in\r\nthe thorax, and thus present a rather powerful appearance.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are smooth, and generally brightly coloured, and feed\r\nprincipally on low plants. The chrysalides are generally inclosed in\r\ncocoons on or beneath the ground, and are often provided with spines or\r\nbristles on the under side.\r\n\r\nWe shall select two members of this family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Early Grey_ (_Xylocampa Areola_)\r\n\r\nOne of the first of the _Noctuae_ to greet us in the spring is the Early\r\nGrey, which may be found resting on fences in April, and, if the season\r\nis mild, in March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--THE EARLY GREY.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are light grey, often tinged with rose pink, and marked\r\nwith dark grey. The orbicular and reniform spots are very distinct, and\r\nsurrounded by a pale line; they are both united at their lower edges.\r\nAlong the hind margin is a series of dark spots. The hind wings are pale\r\nyellowish grey, with a darker central spot, a central transverse darker\r\nline, and a darker line along the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is yellowish grey. The dorsal line is lighter, and\r\npasses through a brownish spot on the eighth segment. It feeds on the\r\nhoneysuckle (_Lonicera Periclymenum_) in July and August, being full\r\ngrown towards the end of the latter month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shark_ (_Cucullia umbratica_)\r\n\r\nThe Shark is a very common moth, to be found everywhere on palings in\r\nJune, but the colour of its wings so closely resembles that of oak and\r\nother light-wood fences that detection is not so easy as with most other\r\nmoths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.--THE SHARK.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are grey, and marked with longitudinal dark lines, the\r\nprincipal of which is a line from the middle of the base to about the\r\ncentre of the wing. The wing rays are also darker than the ground\r\ncolour. The hind wings are greyish white or brownish grey.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very dark brown, with orange spots on the back and\r\nalong the spiracles. It feeds on sow-thistles (_Sonchus oleraceus_, _S.\r\npalustris_, and _S. arvensis_) and sleepwort (_Lactuca virosa_) at night\r\nfrom July to September, and hides during the daytime among the leaves\r\nthat lie close against the ground. When disturbed it does not roll into\r\na ring or feign death like many others of its kind, but wriggles about\r\nmost vigorously as if to repel its foe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--GONOPTERIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Herald Moth_ (_Gonoptera Libatrix_)\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned family is so called on account of the angular\r\nmargins of the wings, especially the fore pair. It contains only one\r\nBritish species, the Herald (Plate XII, fig. 1), a moth that is common\r\neverywhere in August and September. It hybernates in the perfect state,\r\nand the hybernated specimens may be seen in the spring time, from March\r\nup to the end of May or the beginning of June.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are reddish grey, thickly spotted and streaked with\r\nbrown. Transverse whitish lines divide the base into three parts of\r\nnearly equal widths. The basal and central divisions are tinged with\r\norange; and there is a small white spot in the base close to the thorax,\r\nalso another near the centre of the wing. The hind wings are brownish\r\ngrey.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green and velvety, with a whitish stripe on the side,\r\nand yellow spiracles. It feeds on willow (_Salix alba_) and sallow\r\n(_Salix caprea_); and when full grown, about the end of June, it spins a\r\nwhite silken cocoon between leaves of its tree, and changes to a very\r\ndark chrysalis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--PLUSIIDAE\r\n\r\nThe most peculiar feature of the moths of this family is the tufts of\r\nhair that stand up perpendicularly on the top of the thorax. The abdomen\r\nalso is crested, and the fore wings of several species have smooth\r\npatches that display a brilliant metallic lustre.\r\n\r\nMost of the larvae may be described as semi-loopers, for their claspers\r\nnumber only three pairs, and when they walk their backs are considerably\r\nhumped, somewhat after the fashion of the _Geometrae_. Some of them\r\nfurther imitate the _Geometrae_ in their position of rest, holding on by\r\ntheir claspers only, with body straightened out at an angle with the\r\nleaf or twig on which they support themselves.\r\n\r\nUnlike the majority of the _Noctuae_, they do not descend to the ground\r\nwhen about to change, but spin a silken cocoon among the food plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Burnished Brass_ (_Plusia Chrysitis_)\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of the _Plusiidae_ is the Burnished Brass, so called\r\non account of the large patches of bright golden green on the fore\r\nwings. The hind margin of these wings is very gracefully curved, and\r\nbordered with brown. A brown blotch fills the base of the wing, and the\r\nremaining area is of a beautiful metallic greenish yellow, broken by two\r\nlarge brown blotches, one on the costal and the other on the inner\r\nmargin, which closely approach each other and sometimes meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--THE BURNISHED BRASS.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is very common everywhere, and is one of the frequent visitors\r\nto our flower gardens from June to August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is thickest at the twelfth segment, and tapers from this\r\npoint. Its colour is pale green. It has no longitudinal stripes on the\r\nback, but each segment is adorned with four or six oblique white marks.\r\nJust above the spiracles is a white stripe. It feeds on the dead nettle\r\n(_Lamium album_), stinging nettle (_Urtica dioica_), and burdock\r\n(_Arctium minus_), and is full grown in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Silver_ Y (_Plusia Gamma_)\r\n\r\nOur second example of this family is the Silver Y, which may be found in\r\nabundance everywhere from June to October. Its fore wings are of a shiny\r\ngrey colour, beautifully marbled with a rich dark brown; and just below\r\nthe orbicular spot is a brilliant silvery spot, in form something like\r\nthe Greek letter [gamma] placed obliquely. The base of the hind wings is\r\ngrey; along the margin is a broad and dark smoky brown band, and the\r\nfringe is very light grey, barred with the dark tint of the band. This\r\nmoth is commonly driven out of its hiding places among low plants as we\r\nwalk in waste places, and when thus disturbed it takes a short and rapid\r\nflight, generally disappearing so suddenly among the herbage that it is\r\ndifficult to locate it correctly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--THE SILVER Y.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is thickest at the twelfth segment, and tapers gradually\r\nfrom this point towards the head. Its body is green, with several thin\r\nlongitudinal white stripes, and a thin yellow stripe along the\r\nspiracles. It may be found from June to October, feeding on many kinds\r\nof low plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--EUCLIDIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Mother Shipton_ (_Euclidia Mi_)\r\n\r\nPassing over a few small and less important families, we come to the\r\n_Euclidiidae_, which contains only two British moths. One of these is the\r\nMother Shipton, a very common insect that flies in June.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are very dark brown with whitish\r\nmarkings. The latter include a peculiarly tortuous line, the character\r\nof which will be made out more easily from our illustration (Plate XI,\r\nfig. 4) than from a written description. The hind wings are also very\r\ndark brown, and rather prettily spotted with an ochreous tint.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale grey, with four white stripes, and has only\r\nthree pairs of claspers. It feeds in May on clovers (_Trifolium\r\npratense_ and _T. repens_) and other plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--CATOCALIDAE\r\n\r\nThis family contains only four British species, but these few are very\r\nstriking moths. They are of large size; and, unlike the _Noctuae_\r\ngenerally, the chief adornment is reserved for the under wings. When at\r\nrest, the outer or fore wings completely hide the other pair, and then\r\ntheir general appearance is dull, though if closely examined it will be\r\nobserved that these outer wings are really beautifully marbled with\r\nshades of grey.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this family are very peculiar creatures. Their\r\nbodies are convex above and flattened beneath; and if disturbed as they\r\nrest on the bark of a tree, instead of leaving their hold and rolling\r\ninto a ring like so many other larvae of _Noctuae_, they apply themselves\r\nthe closer, and hold on as if to defy our attempts to remove them.\r\nAnother peculiarity of these larvae is the possession of fleshy\r\nprojections along the sides, just above the legs. They feed on the\r\nleaves of trees, and when about to rest they descend to the trunk, and\r\nthere remain protected by their imitative colouring, detection being\r\nrendered even more difficult by the close application of their flattened\r\nunder surface to the bark. Before changing to the chrysalis state, they\r\nspin a light cocoon among the leaves or on the bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Clifden Nonpareil_ (_Catocala Fraxini_)\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the family, and, indeed, of all British _Noctuae_.\r\nThe fore wings and thorax are light grey, dotted and marbled with darker\r\ngrey (see fig. 5, Plate XI); and the thorax and abdomen are banded with\r\nblack and greyish blue.\r\n\r\nThe young entomologist can hardly expect to meet with this fine insect,\r\nfor it is very rare, and it is only occasionally that a specimen is seen\r\nin Britain; but its characteristics are so striking that we have\r\nendeavoured to find it a place here. Reputed British specimens of\r\n_Fraxini_ command the price of a few pounds each, but specimens from the\r\nother side of the Channel may be obtained for a few pence. With such\r\nrarities we should advise a young entomologist to purchase the foreign\r\nspecimen rather than adopt the two other alternatives--give an\r\nexorbitant price for a supposed Britisher, or else remain a stranger to\r\nthe gem, but all foreign specimens should be labelled according to their\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Red Underwing_ (_Catocala Nupta_)\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the family are very similar in appearance,\r\nthe fore wings of all being marbled with shades of grey, relieved by\r\ntouches of black and brown; and the hind wings, red or crimson, give the\r\npopular names to the species.\r\n\r\nThe Red Underwing flies in August and September, and is common in the\r\nsouthern counties of England, as well as in some of the midland\r\ncounties; it may be often seen flying by day around willows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.--THE RED UNDERWING.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is similar in form to that of _Fraxini_, and when at\r\nrest by day on the bark of its tree it is very difficult to detect, so\r\nclosely does it apply itself to the surface, and so perfectly does it\r\nimitate the colour of its surroundings. It feeds on the crack willow\r\n(_Salix fragilis_), sallow (_S. alba_), poplar (_Populus_), and plum\r\n(_Prunus_), and is full grown in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dark Crimson Underwing_ (_Catocala Sponsa_)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful insect is represented on Plate XI (fig. 6). It will be\r\nobserved that the black band crossing the centre of the hind wing is\r\nrather broad and sharply bent--an important feature, since it is the\r\nmost serviceable distinguishing mark between this species and the Light\r\nCrimson Underwing (_C. Promissa_).\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is similar in form and habits to those of _Fraxini_ and\r\n_Nupta_, and feeds on the oak. It is full fed about the beginning of\r\nJune, when it changes to a chrysalis between leaves which it has spun\r\ntogether with silk.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in July and August, and is common only in certain oak\r\nwoods of the southern counties. It is particularly abundant in the New\r\nForest, where scores may be taken in a single night by judicious\r\nsugaring.\r\n\r\nThere yet remain a few small families of the _Noctuae_, but we must leave\r\nthem in order that we may give a proportionate share of our space to the\r\nother great division of the larger moths--the _Geometrae_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_GEOMETRAE_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already referred (page 28) to caterpillars that walk by a\r\nseries of strides, alternately looping and extending their long and\r\nslender bodies. It is this peculiar characteristic of the larvae of\r\nthe present division that suggested the name _Geometrae_--a term that\r\nsignifies 'earth-measurers,' for they appear to measure the ground\r\nover which they travel in terms of their own length. We have also\r\ndealt with the peculiarities of structure in the case of these\r\ncaterpillars--peculiarities which adapt them to this mode of\r\nprogression; and we have now to make a selection from the various\r\nfamilies of this important division for a more detailed description.\r\n\r\nThe _Geometrae_ include nearly three hundred species and sixteen\r\nfamilies. The moths have slender bodies and full wings, and generally\r\nrest with the latter outspread. A few, however, repose with wings erect\r\nlike the butterflies, and a small number conceal their hind wings after\r\nthe manner of the _Noctuae_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--UROPTERYGIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Swallow Tail_ (_Uropteryx sambucaria_)\r\n\r\nOur first family--_Uropterygidae_--has only one British representative,\r\nand that is the well-known Swallow Tail, so common in gardens and among\r\nhedgerows in the south of England. This species is shown on Plate XII\r\n(fig. 2), and the insect is so readily identified by the conspicuous\r\n'tails' on the hind wings that no written description will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is a most peculiar and interesting creature. Its colour\r\nis very variable, being either brown, olive, ochreous, or reddish; and\r\nit is notched or humped in such a manner that it exactly resembles a\r\ntwig. This strange imitation is rendered still more remarkable by the\r\nattitude assumed by the caterpillar when at rest. It fixes itself to a\r\ntwig by means of its two pairs of claspers, with its body standing out\r\nat an angle in a perfectly straight posture; but its head is always\r\nsupported by means of a very slender and almost invisible silk fibre. It\r\nfeeds on a number of plants and trees, including elder (_Sambucus\r\nnigra_), blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), whitethorn (_Crataegus\r\noxyacantha_), bramble (_Rubus fruticosus_), honeysuckle (_Lonicera\r\nPericlymenum_), and forget-me-not (_Myosotis arvensis_). It may be found\r\nfeeding in the autumn, or hybernating in the crevices of the bark of\r\ntrees in winter. In April or May it comes out again; and in June, in\r\nwhich month it is full grown, it binds together some fragments of\r\nleaves, and forms them into a little swinging hammock in which it\r\nchanges to a brown chrysalis spotted with black.\r\n\r\nJust at this time it seems to be particularly sensitive. In the\r\ncaterpillar state it will strongly resent any kind of disturbance, and\r\nwill give a blow to an intruder by suddenly swaying its body right and\r\nleft; and while in its hammock a gentle irritation, such as a puff of\r\nwind from the mouth, will set it wriggling in a furious manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ENNOMIDAE\r\n\r\nThis family contains about twenty species, several of which rank among\r\nthe commonest as well as the most beautiful of the _Geometrae_. Their\r\nwings are more or less angulated; and the antennae are generally\r\npectinated in the males.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are generally humped and twig-like; and, as in the last\r\nspecies, the semblance is increased by the position they assume when at\r\nrest. The number of limbs varies from ten to fourteen, but where the\r\nclaspers exceed two pairs, the additional two or four, as the case may\r\nbe, are seldom used in walking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brimstone Moth_ (_Rumia luteolata_)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the warm evenings of May set in, this lively and bright\r\nlittle moth may be seen flitting about among our hedges at sunset; and\r\nit continues with us throughout the whole of the summer, but is\r\nparticularly plentiful during the month of June.\r\n\r\nThe moth itself need not be described, since it is shown on Plate XII\r\n(fig. 3); but the caterpillar (fig. 25) must receive a passing notice.\r\nIt varies considerably in colour, being either green, brown, or marbled\r\nwith a mixture of shades of both these colours. It has a hump on the\r\nback of the seventh segment, and two more on the ninth, and possesses\r\nfour pairs of claspers. It feeds on whitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_),\r\nblackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), and the apple (_Pyrus Malus_), and may be\r\nfound on these trees throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nSome believe that there are three successive broods of this insect each\r\nyear, but it is doubtful whether this is invariably the rule, since both\r\nthe moth and its larva are to be found without intermission throughout\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Light Emerald_ (_Metrocampa margaritaria_)\r\n\r\nAll the wings of this moth are very pale green, and crossed with a white\r\nband which is bordered with a darker green on the inner side. The fore\r\nwings have an additional transverse line just halfway between the former\r\nand the base, but this one is not so distinct. It flies in July, and is\r\nvery widely distributed, and in some parts is very abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.--THE LIGHT EMERALD.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds in September, and again in May, after hybernation,\r\non several of our forest trees, including the oak (_Quercus Robur_), elm\r\n(_Ulmus campestris_), birch (_Betula alba_), and beech (_Fagus\r\nsylvatica_). It is of a dingy olive colour, with a dark dorsal line, on\r\neach side of which is a row of white spots; and it has three pairs of\r\nclaspers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scalloped Oak_ (_Crocallis elinguaria_)\r\n\r\nThis species is common and widely distributed, and may be seen flying at\r\ndusk towards the end of July and throughout August. It is represented in\r\nfig. 4 of Plate XII. The antennae of the male are strongly pectinated;\r\nthose of the female are simple.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar may be found in the autumn, and again in spring, feeding\r\non the honeysuckle (_Lonicera Periclymenum_), whitethorn (_Crataegus\r\noxyacantha_), blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), beech (_Fagus sylvatica_),\r\nand various fruit trees. It is full grown in June, when it turns to a\r\nchrysalis in a cocoon spun between leaves or moss on or near the ground.\r\nIt is of a greyish-brown or greyish-purple colour, and looks very like a\r\npiece of twig.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The August Thorn_ (_Eugonia quercinaria_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of this family is the August Thorn, represented in the\r\naccompanying woodcut. The fore wings are ochreous yellow, crossed by two\r\nnearly parallel lines of dark brown. In order to distinguish between\r\nthis and one or two similar species it must be observed that both these\r\nlines are angulated near the costa, the inner one very sharply so; and\r\nbetween the two is a distinct brown spot near the costal margin. The\r\nhind wings are paler, and are crossed by an indistinct darker line. The\r\nantennae of the male are strongly fringed; those of the female are\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.--THE AUGUST THORN.]\r\n\r\nThe moth is very common in August and September, and is readily\r\nattracted by lights in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe larva is grey, marbled with reddish brown. It has three small humps\r\non each of the sixth and seventh segments, two on the twelfth, and one\r\nlarger one on the ninth. It feeds on the oak and various other trees\r\nduring the month of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--AMPHIDASYDAE\r\n\r\nThe seven British species of the family _Amphidasydae_ are generally to\r\nbe distinguished by their rather stout abdomens, and the long shaggy\r\nhair that covers their thoraces. The antennae of the males are\r\npectinated, and those of the females simple; and in three cases the\r\nlatter sex is wingless.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars have long and slender twig-like bodies, and are never\r\nprovided with more than two pairs of claspers. The chrysalides terminate\r\nbehind in a sharp spine, and are always to be found buried in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brindled Beauty_ (_Biston hirtaria_)\r\n\r\nEarly in April, and sometimes in March, this moth may be seen in\r\nabundance, resting on the lime trees in and around our towns. In fact,\r\nso strongly marked is its partiality to the haunts of man in the\r\nneighbourhood of our great metropolis that it has received the name of\r\nthe Cockney. The male is represented in fig. 5 of Plate XII, and the\r\nfemale may be distinguished from it by her simple antennae and larger\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is coloured with alternate bands of dark purple brown\r\nand reddish brown. There is a yellow band on the front of the second\r\nsegment, a row of yellow spots on each side, and two little bright\r\nyellow warts on the back of each segment. It feeds by night on lime\r\n(_Tilia vulgaris_), elm (_Ulmus campestris_), and various fruit trees,\r\nand often appears in such numbers that the foliage is almost completely\r\ndevoured. During the daytime it may be seen resting on the bark, almost\r\ninvariably fixed longitudinally on the trunk, where it looks like a\r\nnatural ridge of the bark which it so closely resembles in colour. It\r\nmay be found in June and July, and in August it changes to a chrysalis\r\nat the foot of its tree, just below the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peppered Moth_ (_Amphidasys betularia_)\r\n\r\nAlthough this common species displays no bright tints, yet it is\r\nprettily marked, its whitish wings being peppered and blotched all over\r\nwith black or very dark brown. It flies in May and June, later than any\r\nother species of the family, and may generally be found on fences and\r\ntree trunks during the day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--THE PEPPERED MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is very variable--drab, grey, green, or\r\nbrown; but it may be known by the deep notch in the middle of the head,\r\nand the arrangement of its 'humps.' These latter are only small reddish\r\nor whitish projections, of which there is one on each side of the fifth,\r\nsixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and eleventh segments; also two on the\r\nback of the ninth and twelfth. It feeds in August and September on a\r\nlarge number of trees, including, in fact, nearly all our commonest\r\nforest and fruit trees. In September it enters the soil to undergo its\r\nchange to the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--BOARMIIDAE\r\n\r\nIn the next family--_Boarmiidae_--there are about twenty British members,\r\nmost of which are very pretty moths. They differ generally from the last\r\nfamily in that their bodies are more slender, and although some of them\r\nbear a resemblance to species of the family _Ennomidae_, their wings are\r\nnot angulated. In several cases the fore and hind wings are both\r\nsimilarly marked, a feature very uncommon with moths.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this family usually have humps on the sixth and\r\ntwelfth segments only, and have two pairs of claspers. The pupae are to\r\nbe found either on the ground, among leaves or moss, or beneath the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Waved Umber_ (_Hemerophila abruptaria_)\r\n\r\nThe most gaily coloured member of this family is the Waved Umber, shown\r\nin fig. 6 of Plate XII. Like many other _Geometrae_, it rests on fences\r\nand tree trunks by day with wings expanded so that all four are\r\ndisplayed. It is on the wing in May and early June, and again in August,\r\nand often frequents our gardens at dusk.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very dark brown, with a white collar on the front of\r\nthe second segment. It feeds in June and July on privet (_Ligustrum\r\nvulgare_) and the cultivated rose trees of flower gardens, and probably\r\nalso on the dog rose (_Rosa canina_). When full grown it spins a silken\r\ncocoon in a fork of one of the twigs, and there undergoes its\r\nmetamorphoses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Willow Beauty_ (_Boarmia gemmaria_)\r\n\r\nOur second example of the _Boarmiidae_ is the Willow Beauty, the male of\r\nwhich species is here illustrated. Its wings are brownish grey, marked\r\nwith dark brown lines and streaks. The female is generally larger than\r\nthe male, and has simple antennae. The moth is abundant throughout\r\nEngland, and may be seen generally resting on fences and trees in June\r\nand July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--THE WILLOW BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of the caterpillar is much the same as that of the\r\nmoth, and is marked with a similar darker tint. It has a yellowish line\r\nalong the spiracles, and is much like a piece of brownish twig. It feeds\r\non the oak (_Quercus Robur_), Birch (_Betula alba_), ivy (_Hedera\r\nHelix_), and other trees, and may be found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--GEOMETRIDAE\r\n\r\nThe next family contains eight moths, mostly of small size, all of which\r\nhave green wings, and are popularly known as the 'Emeralds.' In most\r\ncases the male may be distinguished by its pectinated antennae.\r\n\r\nThere is no general characteristic by which we may know all the larvae,\r\nbut some have the head deeply notched.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Large Emerald_ (_Geometra papilionaria_)\r\n\r\nThis species is the largest of the family, and measures over two inches\r\nwhen its wings are expanded. The colour is dull green, with whitish\r\nbands and spots, the arrangement of which may be seen in our engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.--THE LARGE EMERALD.]\r\n\r\nThe moth is out in July, and is common in most parts of England.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on birch (_Betula alba_), beech (_Fagus\r\nsylvatica_) and hazel (_Corylus avellana_) in the autumn, and hybernates\r\nwhile still young. In the spring it feeds again, and is full grown in\r\nJune, when it changes to a chrysalis in a cocoon spun between leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Emerald_ (_Hemithea strigata_)\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of the Emeralds is _Strigata_, which may be found\r\nin June and July in all parts of England, as well as in some localities\r\nin Scotland and Ireland. Its wings are of a dull green colour, the front\r\npair being slightly scalloped on the hind margin, and crossed by\r\nindistinct pale lines; and the hind pair are both scalloped and angled\r\nand crossed in the middle by a transverse pale line. The fringe is\r\nwhite, dotted with dull reddish brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--THE COMMON EMERALD.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is yellowish green, except the second, third, and fourth\r\nsegments which are brownish. It feeds on oak (_Quercus Robur_) and\r\nwhitethorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_), and may be found in June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--EPHYRIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Maiden's Blush_ (_Zonosoma punctaria_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Ephyridae_ contains only six British species, chiefly\r\nremarkable for the fact that their pupae generally resemble those of\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nWe choose for our example the pretty little Maiden's Blush, so called on\r\naccount of the soft reddish patch on the middle of each fore wing. It is\r\nrepresented in fig. 7 of Plate XII. It is moderately common, occurring\r\nmore or less in all parts of England, as well as certain localities in\r\nthe sister countries. It is a double-brooded moth, and may be caught in\r\nMay and August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on oak (_Quercus Robur_), from which it may be\r\nobtained by beating both in June and September. It is either green or\r\ntawny yellow, marked with yellow oblique lines on the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ACIDALIIDAE\r\n\r\nThe moths of this family, over thirty in number, are mostly of small\r\nsize, and have slender bodies. As a rule the wings are not in the least\r\nangulated or scalloped, but in a few species the hind pair are slightly\r\nangled on the hind margin; and both fore and hind wings are similarly\r\nmarked. The antennae are simple in the females, and generally only\r\nslightly ciliated in the males.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are long and slender, without projections, and feed\r\nprincipally on low plants. The pupae are to be found in loose cocoons\r\namong the leaves of the food plants or under the soil.\r\n\r\nWe shall briefly notice three members of this rather extensive family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lace Border_ (_Acidalia ornata_)\r\n\r\nThe wings of this moth are silvery white, marked along the hind margin\r\nwith a beautiful lace-like border. This border consists of delicate\r\nblack and dark grey lines, and includes, in the fore wing, two light\r\nbrown blotches, one near the middle and the other in the anal angle. It\r\nis abundant in England, particularly in chalky districts, but does not\r\nseem to extend into Scotland. It may be seen on the wing from June to\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--THE LACE BORDER.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on thyme (_Thymus Serpyllum_) and marjoram\r\n(_Origanum vulgare_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Riband Wave_ (_A. aversata_)\r\n\r\nAll the wings of this species are of a pale yellowish or ochreous grey.\r\nThe fore wings are crossed by three transverse dark lines, and the hind\r\nwings by two. The space between the two outer lines of the fore wing and\r\nthat between the lines of the hind wing are usually filled in with a\r\ngreyish brown, thus forming the 'riband' from which the popular name of\r\nthe insect is derived; and when this is the case the lines which border\r\nthe riband are scarcely distinguishable. Just inside the second line of\r\nthe fore wings, near the costa, is a small but conspicuous brown spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--THE RIBAND WAVE.]\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in June and July, and is common in all parts.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is dark brown except segments ten to thirteen, which are\r\ngrey. The line along the spiracles is whitish, and the surface of the\r\nbody is roughened by a number of minute warts. It feeds on various low\r\nplants, including the meadow sweet (_Spiraea ulmaria_), water avens\r\n(_Geum rivale_), common avens (_G. urbanum_), and knot-grass (_Polygonum\r\naviculare_), during April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Blood-vein_ (_Timandra amataria_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Acidaliidae_ is the Blood-vein, which is common\r\nin most parts of England in June and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--THE BLOOD-VEIN.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are pale grey, dusted with darker grey, and crossed by an\r\noblique red streak which runs from the tip of the fore wing to near the\r\ninner margin of the hind wing. A slender dark and wavy line lies outside\r\nthis one, parallel with it in the hind wing, but meeting it near the tip\r\nof the fore wing.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is grey, with three white longitudinal stripes. It feeds\r\nin the autumn on dock (_Rumex_), sorrel (_R. acetosa_), and knot-grass\r\n(_Polygonum aviculare_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--CABERIDAE\r\n\r\nSix species, all of rather small size, constitute the British portion of\r\nthe above family. Their wings are mostly white or pale grey, with light\r\nmarkings, and without angles. The moths are to be caught with the net\r\nat dusk, or they may be seen on fences and tree trunks during the day,\r\nwith their wings fully extended and applied closely to the surface on\r\nwhich they rest.\r\n\r\nThe larvae, which have no humps, feed on trees, and change to the\r\nchrysalis state in light silken cocoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Wave_ (_Cabera exanthemata_)\r\n\r\nThe first of our two examples of this small family is the Common Wave,\r\nthe wings of which are pale grey, almost white, dusted all over with\r\nsmall dark dots. The fore wings are crossed by three parallel and\r\nequidistant darker transverse lines, and the hind pair by two. The male\r\nmay be distinguished by its ciliated antennae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--THE COMMON WAVE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is yellow or greenish yellow, with hinder segments\r\nslightly swollen. It feeds during the latter part of the summer on\r\nsallows (_Salix caprea_ and _S. cinerea_) and alder (_Alnus glutinosa_),\r\nand changes to a chrysalis in a light cocoon among fallen leaves. In\r\nthis state it spends the winter, the perfect insect emerging in May or\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThis species is very abundant in most parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Clouded Silver_ (_Bapta temerata_)\r\n\r\nThe other example is the Clouded Silver, the wings of which are white,\r\nand clouded along the hind margin with smoky grey. On the hind margin of\r\nthe fore wings, close to the fringe, is a row of black crescent-shaped\r\nspots; and on the inner side of the cloudings is a waved transverse\r\nband. In the centre of the same wings there is a very distinct dark\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--THE CLOUDED SILVER.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is not so common as the last, but is widely distributed. It\r\nflies in May and June.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is bright green on the upper side, and has a row of\r\norange spots, bordered with brown, down the middle of the back. It feeds\r\nin the autumn on the blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_) and the wild cherry\r\n(_P. Avium_), and spends the winter in the chrysalis state, inclosed in\r\na light silken cocoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--MACARIIDAE\r\n\r\n_The_ V _Moth_ (_Halia Vauaria_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Macariidae_ contains only five British species, four of which\r\nhave the tip of the fore wings extended more or less into an angle, and\r\nthe hind wings are also angled to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--THE V MOTH.]\r\n\r\nOur only example is the V Moth, so called from the conspicuous V-shaped\r\nblackish mark on the middle of the costa of the fore wings. The ground\r\ncolour of all the wings is grey, with a delicate violet tinge. There are\r\nother dark markings in addition to the one mentioned above, and the\r\narrangement of these may be seen in the woodcut.\r\n\r\nThis species is very common in all parts, and flies at about midsummer.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very variable in colour, but is generally green, and\r\nis marked with longitudinal wavy lines. On each side is a series of\r\nyellow blotches, forming a broken lateral stripe, and the body is\r\ncovered with minute black bristle-bearing warts. It feeds in May on\r\ngooseberry and currant bushes, and changes to a chrysalis in a web\r\nbetween the leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--FIDONIIDAE\r\n\r\nWe now come to a family of moths peculiar for their habit of flying more\r\nor less by day. As is often the case with day-flying moths, these are\r\nmostly prettily marked, and are consequently often mistaken by the\r\nuninitiated for butterflies. Most of them are to be found on heaths,\r\ndowns, and open fields; but one--the Bordered White--is met with only in\r\nfir woods.\r\n\r\nThe wings are not angulated, and the antennae of the males are\r\npectinated.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are generally to be distinguished by a couple of little horns\r\non one or more of the hindermost segments, and in most cases they pupate\r\nbeneath the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Heath_ (_Ematurga atomaria_)\r\n\r\nOf this family we shall select two examples, the first of which is the\r\nCommon Heath, often so abundant on heaths and downs that they are\r\ndisturbed at almost every footstep.\r\n\r\nThe ground colour of the wings of the male is a dull yellowish grey, and\r\nthat of the female greyish white. In both cases the wings are crossed by\r\nirregular dark brown bands. The fringe is barred alternately with white\r\nand dark brown, and the whole of the ground tint between the\r\nabove-mentioned bands is thickly dotted with dark brown. The female is\r\ngenerally smaller than the male.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--THE COMMON HEATH.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is very variable in colour, but is generally reddish\r\nbrown, ochreous brown, or greenish, with a light line along the\r\nspiracles, and a series of lozenge-shaped spots on the back. It feeds on\r\ntrefoils (_Lotus corniculatus_ and _L. pilosus_) and various other\r\nplants that grow on heaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bordered White_ (_Bupalus piniaria_)\r\n\r\nThe male of this species is boldly marked with yellowish white and dark\r\nbrown, the arrangement of the two colours being shown in fig. 190. The\r\nfemale is very different in general appearance. Her wings are of an\r\nalmost uniform orange or yellowish-brown tint. The fore wings are darker\r\nnear the tip, and there is generally a darker transverse band across the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--THE BORDERED WHITE--MALE.]\r\n\r\nThe male may often be seen flying in the sunshine among the branches of\r\nfir trees during May and June, but his mate is rather less active, and\r\nis generally to be secured by beating the branches.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green, with whitish stripes and yellow\r\nspiracles. It feeds during August and September on the leaves of the\r\nScotch fir (_Pinus sylvestris_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--ZERENIDAE\r\n\r\n_The Currant Moth_ (_Abraxas grossulariata_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Zerenidae_ contains only four British moths, and of these we\r\nselect the Currant Moth or Magpie. This insect is exceedingly common\r\neverywhere, and on account of its general brightness of appearance, and\r\nalso of its diurnal habits, it is often taken for a butterfly. The\r\nground colour of the wings is creamy white, with a yellow transverse\r\nband, and a yellow blotch at the base; and the whole surface is more or\r\nless blotched with black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--THE CURRANT MOTH.]\r\n\r\nFrom the end of June to August this moth may be seen in abundance in our\r\ngardens, wherever currant bushes exist, flying about both during the\r\nsunshine and at dusk, with rather a heavy movement.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is white, with a yellow line along the spiracles, and\r\nnumerous black dots. There are, in addition to the dots, two large black\r\nblotches on the back of each segment. It feeds during May on currant and\r\ngooseberry bushes, also on the blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_). About the\r\nend of May it spins a light silken cocoon, and changes to a short dumpy\r\nchrysalis of a glossy black colour with bright yellow bands (fig. 34).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--HYBERNIIDAE\r\n\r\nPassing over the family _Ligiidae_, which contains only one British moth,\r\nthe Horse-chestnut, we come to the small but interesting family,\r\n_Hyberniidae_.\r\n\r\nOf this we have six species, five of which favour us during the bleakest\r\nmonths of the year. Two of them visit us in October and November, and\r\neven remain with us up to Christmas. The others follow closely on them,\r\nand may be seen from January to March.\r\n\r\nThe males have slender bodies, and their wings are full and without\r\nangles; but the females are either perfectly or nearly wingless. In\r\nthree cases there is hardly a trace of wings in this sex, so that they\r\nlook more like spiders than moths.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are long and slender and without humps, and all feed on\r\nthe leaves of trees. They change to the chrysalis state under the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spring Usher_ (_Hybernia leucophaearia_)\r\n\r\nEarly in February, and often even in January, this moth may be seen in\r\nabundance in almost every oak wood, sitting on the bark of the trees,\r\nor occasionally taking a short flight in the sunshine. In colour it is\r\nvery variable. The wings have always a whitish ground marbled and dotted\r\nwith dark brown, but in some the fore wings are almost entirely dark\r\nbrown with the exception of a transverse central bar. The female has\r\nonly the slightest rudiments of wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--THE SPRING USHER.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the young buds and leaves of the oak (_Quercus\r\nRobur_) and sycamore (_Acer Pseudoplatanus_), concealing itself among\r\nthe small leaves which it has spun together. It is full grown in June,\r\nwhen it changes to a chrysalis on the surface of the ground, and remains\r\nhere throughout the summer and part of the following winter.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the caterpillar is very variable, but is usually pale\r\ngreen with white markings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mottled Umber_ (_Hybernia defoliaria_)\r\n\r\nThis very pretty moth is represented in fig. 8 of Plate XII. It is very\r\ncommon in most parts, and visits us at the fall of the leaf, generally\r\nappearing in October, and remaining on the wing till November. Our\r\nillustration gives the usual appearance of the male, but in some\r\nspecimens the four wings are all of one uniform reddish-brown colour,\r\nevenly dotted all over with a darker tint. The female is quite wingless.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is exceedingly pretty. Its head is large and brown. The\r\nback is brown, bordered with a fine black line. Below this is a broad\r\nand bright yellow line, with a red spot on each segment. The spiracles\r\nare white. It feeds during spring on oak (_Quercus Robur_), whitethorn\r\n(_Crataegus oxyacantha_), blackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_), and other trees.\r\nWhen disturbed it always allows itself to fall for a foot or two, and\r\nthen remains swinging at the end of a silken fibre till danger is over,\r\nor hunger recalls it to its food. It changes to a chrysalis on the\r\nground about the middle of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The March Moth_ (_Anisopteryx aescularia_)\r\n\r\nThis is another common moth, and should be looked for during March and\r\nApril on the barks of trees in oak and other woods. The fore wings are\r\nof a dingy brown colour, paler near the base, and crossed by a pale wavy\r\nline. The hind wings are lighter, with a central dark spot. But this\r\ndescription applies to the male only, for the female is wingless, and\r\nmay be known by the tuft of hair that tips the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--THE MARCH MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green, clouded with a darker tint, and has a\r\nwhite line on each side of the back. It feeds in May on the three trees\r\nnamed for the last species, also on lime (_Tilia vulgaris_) and elm\r\n(_Ulmus campestris_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--LARENTIIDAE\r\n\r\nThis is by far the most extensive family of the _Geometrae_, containing\r\nas it does considerably over a hundred species, or well nigh a half of\r\nthe whole group.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the various species are smooth and more or less glossy, and\r\nthe front pair are generally crossed by several wavy lines. Many of the\r\nmoths, and particularly those known popularly as the Pugs, are very\r\nsmall. Representatives of the family are to be met with almost\r\nthroughout the year--from early spring to the middle of the winter.\r\n\r\nMost of the caterpillars are rather long and slender, and without humps;\r\nand green is the prevailing colour. They feed either on trees or low\r\nplants, often protecting themselves in folded leaves; and some of the\r\nsmaller species show a decided preference for flowers and seeds.\r\n\r\nWe shall select about a dozen of the commonest members for individual\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The November Moth_ (_Oporabia dilutata_)\r\n\r\nOur first example is the November moth--a rather dingy and very variable\r\nspecies that may be found almost everywhere in October and November. The\r\nground colour of the fore wings is dingy grey, crossed by several darker\r\nlines, subject to considerable variations. The hind wings are paler,\r\nwith two slender darker lines parallel with the hind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--THE NOVEMBER MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on many trees, the principal of which are the oak,\r\nwhitethorn and blackthorn. Like the perfect insect, it is very variable\r\nin colour, but is generally of a bright green, with reddish or purplish\r\nspots on the back and sides. The spiracles are yellow or orange, and\r\nbelow them is a white stripe. It is full fed in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Twin-spot Carpet_ (_Larentia didymata_)\r\n\r\nThe Twin-spot Carpet is common throughout Great Britain, and the\r\nbeginner is likely to meet with it in June and July during his first\r\nseason. Our illustration represents the male, the fore wings of which\r\nare greyish brown, crossed by several dark lines, and with a double dark\r\nand conspicuous spot near the middle of the hind margin. The female is\r\nmuch lighter, and the markings are also lighter and less distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.--THE TWIN-SPOT CARPET.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale green, with a narrow whitish line along the\r\nspiracles. It feeds in April and May on the leaves of the wood anemone\r\n(_Anemone nemorosa_), chervil (_Chaerophyllum temulum_), and other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grass Rivulet_ (_Emmelesia albulata_)\r\n\r\nWe represent the genus _Emmelesia_ by the Grass Rivulet--a pretty little\r\nmoth that flies in June, and which is widely distributed though not\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.--THE GRASS RIVULET.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are pale grey, crossed by several white lines, the\r\narrangement of which may be seen in our engraving. The hind wings are of\r\nthe same ground colour, but have no markings except a white wavy line\r\nnear the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds during July and August on the seeds of the yellow\r\nrattle (_Rhinanthus Crista-galli_), protecting itself from its enemies\r\nby spinning together the petals of the flowers; and when full grown it\r\nchanges to a chrysalis under the same cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Netted Pug_ (_Eupithecia venosata_)\r\n\r\nWe now come to the enormous genus _Eupithecia_, containing about fifty\r\nsmall species, most of which are known as 'Pugs.' Many of these are\r\nonly imperfectly known, there being yet much to learn about their\r\nearlier stages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--THE NETTED PUG.]\r\n\r\nThe Netted Pug flies in May and June, and is to be found in most parts\r\nof Great Britain. Its fore wings are brownish grey, crossed by two\r\nzigzag light bands, both of which are bordered with black, and divided\r\nthroughout by a fine dark line. There are also other dark lines, both\r\ntransverse and longitudinal, arranged as here represented.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds during July inside the seed capsules of campions\r\n(_Silene Cucubalis_, _S. maritima_, _S. acaulis_, and _Lychnis diurna_)\r\nand catchfly (_Silene gallica_ and _S. nutans_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Narrow-winged Pug_ (_Eupithecia nanata_)\r\n\r\nEarly in May, and frequently in April, this pretty little moth may be\r\nseen flying about at dusk among the heather on our moors. It is one of\r\nthe first Pugs of the season, and is widely distributed, and very common\r\nin some localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--THE NARROW-WINGED PUG.]\r\n\r\nIts wings are dark grey, and marked with several transverse wavy light\r\nlines. The fringe is dark grey, spotted with white.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds during August and September on the ling (_Calluna\r\nvulgaris_) and heath (_Erica cinerea_ and _E. Tetralix_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brindled Pug_ (_Eupithecia abbreviata_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of the Pugs is the Brindled Pug, another early species,\r\nappearing on the wing in March and April. It is common in most parts,\r\nand may generally be easily obtained by searching fences and tree\r\ntrunks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.--THE BRINDLED PUG.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are very long in proportion. The colour is yellowish\r\nbrown, crossed by darker lines. The fore wings have a very broad band of\r\nthe ground colour, broken by two short lines, and crossed by a slender\r\nangulated stripe.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the oak in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Seraphim_ (_Lobophora sexalisata_)\r\n\r\nThis moth is very much like the Pugs in general appearance, and is quite\r\nas small and even smaller than some of them; but it and the other\r\nmembers of its genus differ from the Pugs in that they cover their hind\r\nwings when at rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.--THE SMALL SERAPHIM.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are yellowish or pale brownish grey with four paler\r\ntransverse lines, the two median ones of which are divided throughout by\r\na darker fine wavy line. The hind wings are grey, paler at the base, and\r\ncrossed centrally by a double darker line. This species flies in May and\r\nJune, and though apparently widely distributed, can hardly be described\r\nas common.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the white willow (_Salix alba_) and sallow (_S.\r\ncaprea_) in August and September; and the chrysalis may be found in a\r\nsilken cocoon among the fallen leaves throughout the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Blue-bordered Carpet_ (_Melanthia bicolorata_)\r\n\r\nThis same family (_Larentiidae_) is remarkable for its large number of\r\npretty moths, popularly known as the 'Carpets,' many of which are\r\nexceedingly common in our woods and gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.--THE BLUE-BORDERED CARPET.]\r\n\r\nOur first example of these is the Blue-bordered, which is pretty well\r\nrepresented in several counties of Great Britain and Ireland. Its white\r\nfore wings are boldly marked with a blotch of greyish brown at the base,\r\nand another extending from the middle of the costal margin more than\r\nhalfway across. The hind margin is marked with two bluish grey bars,\r\nseparated by a white line. The hind wings are white, with a very small\r\ndark spot, and a bluish grey margin something like that of the fore\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with longitudinal stripes of a darker and\r\nlighter shade. It feeds in June on the alder (_Alnus glutinosa_) and\r\nblackthorn (_Prunus spinosa_); and when full grown it changes to a brown\r\nchrysalis within a light silken web.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Beautiful Carpet_ (_Melanthia albicillata_)\r\n\r\nThe Beautiful Carpet belongs to the same genus as _Bicolorata_. Its\r\nwings are of a rich creamy white, clouded with grey along the hind\r\nmargin. The basal blotches of the fore wings are large, of a dark brown\r\ncolour, and marbled with a light tint. Near the tips of these wings is\r\nanother conspicuous blotch of the same colour, from which a delicate\r\nwavy dark line runs to the inner margin. A small dark spot also lies\r\nnear the middle of the costal margin of each of the four wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.--THE BEAUTIFUL CARPET.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with a white line along the spiracles, and a\r\ntriangular reddish spot on the back of segments four to ten inclusive.\r\nIt feeds on the bramble (_Rubus fruticosus_), raspberry (_R. Idaeus_),\r\nand wild strawberry (_Fragaria vesca_). It may be found in June and\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Common Carpet_ (_Melanippe sociata_)\r\n\r\nThe genus _Melanippe_ contains twelve species, some of which are\r\nextremely common. One of these moths--the Common Carpet--is represented\r\nin fig. 203. Its wings are all of a smoky-brown colour, crossed by\r\nnumerous white lines, the arrangement of which may be gathered from our\r\nillustration better than from a written description. It is a\r\ndouble-brooded insect, appearing first in May, and then again about the\r\nend of July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.--THE COMMON CARPET.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is mottled with shades of brown and grey. On the back\r\nare five or six greyish-white lozenge-shaped marks, and there are a few\r\nwhite dots on the back of each segment. It feeds on the hedge bedstraw\r\n(_Galium Mollugo_), and when full grown it changes to a chrysalis in a\r\nlight cocoon on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Silver Ground Carpet_ (_Melanippe montanata_)\r\n\r\nIn this species the ground colour is silvery white. The bases of the\r\nfore wings are blotched with pale brown, and a dark brownish-grey bar,\r\ncontaining a black spot, crosses the middle. The hind margins of the\r\nfore wings are faintly marked with pale brown, and lines of the same\r\ntint, more or less distinct, cross the hind wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--THE SILVER GROUND CARPET.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is very common in all parts of the country, and may be seen on\r\nthe wing throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is light brown, with several longitudinal lines of\r\ndifferent colours. On the back of each of the segments seven, eight, and\r\nnine is a distinct black V-shaped mark, terminating behind with a bright\r\nred spot. It feeds on the primrose (_Primula acaulis_) in the autumn,\r\nhybernates through the winter, and is full grown about the beginning of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Garden Carpet_ (_Melanippe fluctuata_)\r\n\r\nOur third and last member of this genus is the Garden Carpet--a moth\r\nthat must be pretty well known to almost everybody, since it is the\r\ncommonest of all the _Geometrae_ that frequent our gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.--THE GARDEN CARPET.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are pale grey or brownish, with a patch of dark greyish\r\nbrown at the base, another larger one on the middle of the costa, and a\r\nthird near the tip. The wing is usually clouded between the middle\r\nblotch and the inner margin, and numerous fine wavy lines, more or less\r\ndistinct, cross the wing.\r\n\r\nThis moth may be seen throughout the summer, from May to September, but\r\nis most abundant in June and July.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is extremely variable in colour, being either green,\r\nbrown, or grey, or some intermediate tint; and is marbled and dotted\r\nwith dark brown on the back. It feeds on the nasturtium (_Tropaeolum\r\nmajus_), rape (_Brassica Napus_), and various other cruciferous plants;\r\nand may be found from April to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Yellow Shell_ (_Camptogramma bilineata_)\r\n\r\nPassing over two smaller genera, we come to the beautiful little Yellow\r\nShell. This moth is so abundant in most parts that we arouse it at\r\nalmost every stroke while beating low bushes.\r\n\r\nAll its wings are yellow, and crossed by numerous delicate white and\r\nbrown lines. The most conspicuous feature is the two white lines, with\r\ndark brown edging, crossing the fore wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.--THE YELLOW SHELL.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds by night, and is therefore seldom seen except by\r\nthose who make special nocturnal searches with the aid of a lantern or\r\nsweep net. It devours various grasses, and hides itself among the roots\r\nor under stones during the daytime. It is full grown in April or May.\r\nThe colour is dull pale green, with a dark green dorsal line, and two\r\nwhite stripes on each side.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Ph[oe]nix_ (_Cidaria silaceata_)\r\n\r\nAgain passing over a few small and less important genera, we select the\r\nsmall Ph[oe]nix as the last example of this very extensive family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.--THE SMALL PH[OE]NIX.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are dark brown, paler toward the hind\r\nmargin. Most of the wing rays are generally of a pale yellowish colour,\r\nand a variable and complicated system of whitish lines crosses the wings\r\nnear the base, and another near the hind margin. Among the latter there\r\nis always a series of dark triangular spots, with apices pointing\r\ntowards the hind margin.\r\n\r\nThis moth is moderately common throughout the British Isles, and is\r\ndouble brooded, appearing in May and August.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is green, with a row of brown spots along the middle of\r\nthe back. When full grown it changes to a chrysalis in a light web.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily--EUBOLIIDAE\r\n\r\nThis is the last family of the _Geometrae_ we shall notice, and contains\r\nten species. Most of these are rather pretty moths, and all have the\r\ntips of the fore wings more or less pointed. As a rule, too, there is a\r\ndark streak running from the very tip of the wing for a short distance\r\nobliquely inward.\r\n\r\nThey are generally very light sleepers, and are easily beaten from their\r\nhiding places during the day.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are not humped, and may be found feeding on low plants.\r\n\r\nWe shall briefly examine two species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Mallow_ (_Eubolia limitata_)\r\n\r\nThis moth is pretty abundant in waste places from June to August, and is\r\neasily obtained by lightly beating the foliage of small bushes and low\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.--THE SMALL MALLOW.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are pale brown crossed by a broad central bar, the edges\r\nof which are darker. The hind wings are of a paler brown, and are\r\ncrossed by two or three fine wavy lines.\r\n\r\nAlthough the perfect insect is so common, the caterpillar seems to be\r\nseldom met with. It is a grass feeder, and may be looked for in May and\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Treble Bar_ (_Anaitis plagiata_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Geometrae_ is the Treble Bar, a very pretty\r\nmoth, which is illustrated in fig. 9 of Plate XII. It may be readily\r\nidentified by the aid of this coloured picture, and therefore need not\r\nbe described in words. It is pretty generally distributed throughout the\r\nBritish Isles, and is in some parts a very abundant species,\r\nparticularly so in the neighbourhood of London.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is brown, with paler spaces between the segments. The\r\ndorsal line is black and interrupted, and a yellow line runs along each\r\nside. It feeds on the leaves and flowers of the perforated St. John's\r\nwort (_Hypericum perforatum_).\r\n\r\nThis insect is double brooded, the moth appearing in May and August, and\r\nremaining with us throughout the month following in each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_THE MICRO-LEPIDOPTERA_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe butterflies, and all the moths contained in the groups of the last\r\nfour chapters, are commonly spoken of as constituting the\r\n_Macro-lepidoptera_; but in addition to these there are many hundreds of\r\nsmall British moths that represent what is known as the\r\n_Micro-lepidoptera_.\r\n\r\nIt is not usual for young entomologists to have much to do with the\r\n'Micros' until they have had a little practical experience with the\r\nlarger species; in fact, a good number of them never seem to extend\r\ntheir knowledge beyond the limits of the 'Macros' except that they may\r\nmake an occasional capture of a Micro that happens to fly across their\r\npath.\r\n\r\nNow, since it would be practically impossible to deal fairly, even in\r\noutline, with both these divisions of the _Lepidoptera_ in a work of the\r\npresent dimensions, I have devoted most space to the larger species so\r\nas to meet the probable requirements of the majority of my readers. But\r\nin order that the beginner may also have the means of introducing\r\nhimself intelligently to a study of the 'Micros,' I shall set apart this\r\nchapter for a simple account of the broad principles of their\r\nclassification, illustrated by means of a few types, so that the\r\ncollector may at least know _something_ of the insects he captures, even\r\nthough he may not be able at once to fix on their names.\r\n\r\nThe young entomologist, thus provided with the broad features that\r\nenable him to roughly classify the specimens which reach his cabinet,\r\nmay, as his store increases, pay an occasional visit to a public museum\r\nor the private collection of an entomological friend, and so obtain the\r\nnames and other details he may require.\r\n\r\nThe _Micro-lepidoptera_ are divided into five main groups--_Pyralides_,\r\n_Pterophori_, _Crambi_, _Tortrices_, and _Tineae_, each of which is\r\ndivided into families and genera, as we have seen in the case of the\r\n'Macros.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pyralides_\r\n\r\nThe _Pyralides_ may be easily distinguished by the proportionately long\r\nfore wings, long legs, and elongated abdomen. Some of them have wings of\r\na pearly lustre, and are accordingly known popularly as the 'Pearls.'\r\nSome species fly in bright sunshine, others appear on the wing before\r\nsunset, and fly till dusk; others, again, are purely nocturnal in their\r\nhabits. All, however, are apparently light sleepers, and may be easily\r\nbeaten out of their resting places and netted by day. Some of these\r\nmoths are common everywhere, but the majority of them are very local,\r\nthough they may be extremely abundant where they occur.\r\n\r\nThe larvae have a glossy and bristly appearance, and are generally\r\ngregarious in their habits.\r\n\r\nThis group contains about eighty species, arranged in five families as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1. _Pyralididae_, including about forty species.\r\n  2. _Botydae_, about thirty species.\r\n  3. _Steniiadae_, containing only five species.\r\n  4. _Hydrocampidae_, four species.\r\n  5. _Acentropodidae_, containing only one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tabby_ (_Aglossa pinguinalis_)\r\n\r\nThe first of these families contains the Tabby or Grease Moth, commonly\r\nmet with both in the larval and perfect states in barns and stables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.--THE TABBY OR GREASE MOTH.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are brownish grey, crossed with zigzag darker lines, and\r\nhaving a black spot near the centre of the costal margin. The term\r\n'Tabby' has been applied on account of the fancied resemblance of the\r\ntransverse markings to the fur of a tabby cat, and the other popular\r\nname was given under the belief that the caterpillar feeds on fatty\r\nmatter, but it is extremely doubtful whether this supposition is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar probably feeds exclusively on the vegetable\r\naccumulations that lie in the undisturbed corners and crevices of\r\nouthouses and stables, and lives concealed in silken tubes, strengthened\r\noutside by fragments of hay, chaff &c. that have been spun together. It\r\nfeeds from September to April, except during very severe weather, and\r\nwhen full grown it leaves its tube, and changes to a chrysalis in a\r\nlight silken cocoon in some secluded corner.\r\n\r\nThe moth emerges in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Meal Moth_ (_Pyralis farinalis_)\r\n\r\nThe same family contains the common Meal Moth, so called because in the\r\nlarval state it feeds on meal and allied substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.--THE MEAL MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are yellowish grey, with reddish basal patches, a broad\r\nreddish band along the hind margin, and two whitish indented transverse\r\nlines. The hind wings are grey, and are crossed by two lines similar to\r\nand continuous with those of the front pair.\r\n\r\nThis moth is to be found in abundance throughout the summer months in\r\nplaces where corn, meal, and grain are stored in large quantities,\r\nsitting on walls and rafters during the daytime, and taking to flight in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on corn, meal, grain, bran, &c., and lives\r\nconcealed in a silken tube covered outside with particles of its food\r\nsubstance. It is not fully grown till nearly two years old, and then\r\nchanges to a chrysalis in a white silken cocoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Magpie_ (_Eurrhypara urticata_)\r\n\r\nThe family _Botydae_ contains the moths that are popularly known as the\r\n'Pearls' on account of the pearly lustre of the wings. One of its\r\nspecies--the Small Magpie--is shown in the accompanying illustration.\r\nIts fore wings are pearly white, with blackish hind margin, a yellow\r\nstreak at the base, and blackish markings, the arrangement of which may\r\nbe seen in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.--THE SMALL MAGPIE.]\r\n\r\nIt is a very common moth, flying at dusk during June and July in waste\r\nplaces where the stinging nettle grows.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is whitish, with a dark dorsal line. It feeds on the\r\nstinging nettle (_Urtica dioica_), always remaining concealed between\r\nleaves which it has spun together with silken threads.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mother-of-Pearl_ (_Botys ruralis_)\r\n\r\nThis is another very common species of the family _Botydae_, abundant\r\nalmost everywhere, and to be found on the wing from June to August.\r\n\r\nIts wings are whitish, and exhibit a very decided pearly lustre, and all\r\nthe markings are of a dull dark grey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.--THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is glossy, and has a semi-transparent appearance. It is\r\ngreenish white above, with a darker line down the back; and the sides\r\nare of a brighter green. It feeds on the stinging nettle (_Urtica\r\ndioica_) during May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Garden Pebble_ (_Pionea forficalis_)\r\n\r\nThe same family contains also the Garden Pebble, which is one of the\r\ncommonest frequenters of gardens, both in town and country.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are pale yellowish grey with brown markings. The latter\r\ninclude a fine line from the tip to the middle of the inner margin, and\r\nanother paler one inside and parallel with this, having a dark spot near\r\nits centre. The hind wings are lighter, and have a pale and interrupted\r\nline parallel with the hind margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.--THE GARDEN PEBBLE.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale greenish, with a dark line along the back and on\r\neach side. It feeds on the cabbage and other cruciferous plants.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies from May to the end of the summer, and the caterpillar\r\nmay be found about midsummer, and again in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Beautiful China Mark_ (_Hydrocampa stagnata_)\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Pyralides_--the Beautiful China Mark--belongs\r\nto the family _Hydrocampidae_. This small family is remarkable for the\r\nfact that its four species spend their larval state in the water,\r\nfeeding on the under surfaces of the leaves of water lilies and other\r\naquatic plants. These curious larvae live either in cases which they\r\nconstruct for their protection, something after the fashion of the larvae\r\nof caddis flies, or quite free in the water, and then they are supplied\r\nwith special breathing organs that enable them to absorb the oxygen held\r\nin solution in the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.--THE BEAUTIFUL CHINA MARK.]\r\n\r\nThe moth we have selected for illustration is a very common species, and\r\nmay be seen flying in great numbers in the neighbourhood of ponds during\r\nJune and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pterophori_\r\n\r\nThe members of this remarkable group are easily distinguishable from all\r\nother moths by the feathery appearance of their wings, a feature that\r\nhas gained for them the popular name of _Plume Moths_. Their fore wings\r\nare more or less divided or cleft, and their hind wings are generally\r\ndivided into three distinct feathery plumes.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are hairy, and when full fed they suspend themselves by their\r\nanal claspers, and change to the chrysalis state without any kind of\r\ncovering. They are generally to be found in spring and early summer, but\r\nsome of them feed in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalides are often hairy, though some of them are perfectly\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nPlume moths are to be met with more or less throughout the year. Many of\r\nthe earlier species appear on the wing in spring and early summer; but\r\nthe late feeders emerge in the autumn, and hybernate through the winter,\r\noften taking to the wing on the mild days of our coldest months.\r\n\r\nThe _Pterophori_ include only about forty British species, all of which,\r\nwith two exceptions, belong to the family _Pterophoridae_. The two\r\nexceptions represent as many families--one the _Chrysocorididae_, and the\r\nother the _Alucitidae_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Platyptilia gonodactyla_\r\n\r\nThis is one of the commonest of the _Pterophoridae_, generally appearing\r\nin our gardens and in waste places towards the end of May, and\r\ncontinuing with us for some time. It starts from its retreat at or\r\nbefore sunset, and remains on the wing after dark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--GONODACTYLA.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are ochreous grey, with a narrow brown costal margin, and\r\na triangular brown patch on the costa. Beyond this patch the wing is\r\ncleft. The hind wings consist of three distinct brownish plumes, the\r\nthird of which has a small tuft of black scales projecting from the\r\nmiddle of the inner margin.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the flower stalks of the coltsfoot during March\r\nand April.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leioptilus osteodactylus_\r\n\r\nThis is another species of the same family. It is not uncommon, but is\r\nmore local than the last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--OSTEODACTYLUS.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are pale yellow, with a small brown dot at the\r\ncommencement of the dividing fissure, and a brown blotch on the costal\r\nmargin nearer the tip. The hind wings are divided into three distinct\r\nplumes like those of _Gonodactyla_.\r\n\r\nThis is a later species, appearing on the wing in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aciptilia pentadactyla_\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this species are white, frequently with a few greyish\r\nscales, and are deeply divided into two feathery plumes. The hind wings\r\nare pure white, and consist of three plumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.--PENTADACTYLA.]\r\n\r\nThis pretty insect is common and widely distributed, and flies during\r\nJune and July.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on the convolvulus in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alucita hexadactyla_\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Pterophori_ is the Twelve-plume Moth, the only\r\nBritish representative of the family _Alucitidae_.\r\n\r\nThis little insect is of a yellowish colour, with two dark bands across\r\nthe fore wings; and both fore and hind wings are divided into six\r\ndistinct feathers. It is a common moth, and frequents sheltered spots,\r\nflying at dusk. It appears in August, remains on the wing till October,\r\nand then hybernates till the following April. During the winter it is\r\ncommonly met with in outhouses and even in dwelling houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.--HEXADACTYLA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds during June and July on the flower buds of the\r\nhoneysuckle (_Lonicera Periclymenum_). It is not hairy, like most of the\r\nlarvae of the last family; and, unlike these, it changes to a chrysalis\r\nin a silken cocoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crambi_\r\n\r\nThe third group of the 'Micros' is the _Crambi_, and contains about\r\neighty species, arranged in four families.\r\n\r\nSome of them are common moths with which all must be more or less\r\nfamiliar, as they are roused from the grasses on which they repose at\r\nalmost every footstep as we walk through meadows in the summer. When at\r\nrest, they present a very peculiar appearance. Their wings are wrapped\r\nclosely round their bodies in such a manner that they are hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the stems on which they repose.\r\n\r\nThe larvae have sixteen limbs, and are very variable in their habits.\r\nSome feed among moss or dry stems in silken tubes, some on the stems of\r\nreeds, and others inhabit the hives of bees and feed on the wax of the\r\nhoneycomb.\r\n\r\nThe four families are:\r\n\r\n1. _Chilidae_--five species.\r\n\r\n2. _Crambidae_--about thirty species.\r\n\r\n3. _Phycidae_--over forty species.\r\n\r\n4. _Galleridae_--five species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chilo Phragmitellus_\r\n\r\nThis species is one of those moths known as the 'Veneers,' and is\r\npopularly termed the Wainscot Veneer. It is one of the largest of the\r\nfamily _Chilidae_.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are long, narrow, and pointed at the tip. They are of a\r\npale ochreous brown colour, with a row of small black dots along the\r\nhind margin.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is pale grey, with brown stripes; and the head and\r\nsecond segment are yellowish brown. It feeds on the common reed\r\n(_Phragmites_) in the autumn, and hybernates till the following spring,\r\nwhen it resumes its feeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--PHRAGMITELLUS--ENLARGED ONE-HALF.]\r\n\r\nThis insect is rather local, but may be searched for in all marshy\r\nplaces where reeds abound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crambus hamellus_\r\n\r\nThe family _Crambidae_ is represented by the above-named species, which\r\nhas the popular title of Pearl-streak Veneer. It is not a common moth,\r\nbut is to be obtained in some localities by beating low herbage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220.--HAMELLUS--SLIGHTLY ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are ochreous and glossy, with a silvery streak from the\r\nbase, running almost parallel with the costal margin. The hind margin is\r\nyellow, bordered inside by a wavy brown line. The hind wings are pale\r\ngreyish brown with a yellowish margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crambus tristellus_\r\n\r\nThe same family contains the species _Tristellus_, which, unlike the\r\npreceding insect, is abundant everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.--TRISTELLUS.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are generally yellowish brown, but exceedingly variable.\r\nA pale streak runs from the base to just beyond the middle of the wing,\r\nand is then forked. Near the hind margin is a very indistinct brown wavy\r\nline. The hind wings are dull smoke colour with a light fringe. As with\r\nthe other moths of the family, its labial palpi are very long.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crambus hortuellus_\r\n\r\nThis is also an abundant species, to be met with everywhere during June\r\nand July.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are dull ochreous brown. The wing rays are whitish near\r\nthe inner margin, and a brown line with a silvery edging crosses near\r\nthe hind margin. The hind wings are dull smoky brown, with a shining\r\nsurface, and the fringe is light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.--HORTUELLUS.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is pale grey with dark grey spots, and may be found among moss\r\nin April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galleria mellonella_\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Crambi_ is a moth that the young entomologist\r\nis not likely to meet with unless he happens to be in the neighbourhood\r\nof one of its haunts, but its habits are so peculiar that we are tempted\r\nto introduce it on that account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.--MELLONELLA.]\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the family _Galleridae_, the larvae of which feed on the wax\r\ncombs in the hives of bees and in the nests of wild bees. They are\r\nprotected from the stings of the inmates by silken tubes which they\r\nconstruct, and by the hardened covering of their heads and front\r\nsegments--the only parts that remain exposed while they are feeding.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of the moth are reddish-grey or brownish, sometimes with\r\na greenish tinge, and yellowish along the inner margin. The hind wings\r\nare greyish brown.\r\n\r\nIt flies in July and August, and the caterpillar feeds in May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tortrices_\r\n\r\nThis is a large group of moths, deriving their name from the peculiar\r\nhabit of a number of the larvae of twisting or rolling up leaves for\r\ntheir protection. This habit, however, is not common to all, for some\r\nfeed on stems and flowers, and others devour seeds and fruits.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects may easily be known by the shape of the wings. The\r\nfore pair are gracefully curved on the costal margin in such a way that,\r\nwhen the insect is at rest with its wings closed, its outline is much\r\nthe shape of a bell.\r\n\r\nThe identification of the various species of this extensive group is no\r\neasy task, for many of them are so variable in their colouring that\r\ninsects of the same species are often very different from each other.\r\nSo puzzling indeed is this tendency to run into varieties that many\r\ninsects, once considered to belong to separate species, have been\r\nreduced to one; and this has been the case in a number of instances.\r\n\r\nThere are so many of these little moths that we cannot even give a\r\nrepresentative of each family, but the following outline will serve to\r\nshow the extensiveness of the group.\r\n\r\n  Family 1. _Tortricidae_, about sixty species.\r\n    \"    2. _Penthinidae_,   \"  twenty    \"\r\n    \"    3. _Spilonotidae_,  \"  twelve    \"\r\n    \"    4. _Sericoridae_,   \"  twenty-seven species.\r\n    \"    5. _Sciaphilidae_,  \"  twenty-four     \"\r\n    \"    6. _Grapholithidae_, about one hundred and fifty species.\r\n    \"    7. _Pyraloididae_, four species.\r\n    \"    8. _Conchylidae_, about fifty species.\r\n    \"    9. _Apheliidae_, three species.\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly examine a few of the commonest insects of the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tortrix xylosteana_\r\n\r\nThis pretty moth is common in most parts, and may often be met with in\r\nabundance in wooded localities during July. It belongs to the family\r\n_Tortricidae_.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are ochreous brown. A very dark oblique streak, edged\r\nwith yellow, runs from the inner margin of the base. A reddish patch in\r\nthe centre of the wing, also edged with yellow, is narrow on the costa,\r\nand expands as it approaches the inner margin. Beyond this are another\r\ndark patch on the costa and two reddish-brown blotches on the hind\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224.--XYLOSTEANA WITH WINGS CLOSED.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is greenish brown, marked with white spots which have black\r\ncentres; and it feeds on oak (_Quercus Robur_), honeysuckle (_Lonicera\r\nPericlymenum_), and other plants, in the month of May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tortrix viridana_\r\n\r\nIn June and July this pretty but destructive little insect may be seen\r\nflying in abundance in almost every oak wood. Its fore wings are one\r\nuniform pale green with the exception of a streak of yellow along the\r\ncostal margin; and, when at rest, scores may exist on a single twig\r\nwithout being seen unless closely examined. The hind wings are of a pale\r\nsmoky tint, and rather glossy.\r\n\r\nThe larva is green, with black spots, and feeds in May and June on the\r\noak and other trees, often almost completely devouring the foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.--VIRIDANA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peronea cristana_\r\n\r\nThis moth is not so generally abundant, but is very common in many of\r\nthe woods of the south. It is remarkable for the large number of\r\nvarieties that have been observed, many of which have been regarded as\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.--CRISTANA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are of some shade of brown or grey, with a light streak\r\nof variable colour along the inner margin, and a tuft of raised white\r\nscales in the middle of the wing.\r\n\r\nIt flies during August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptycholoma lecheana_\r\n\r\nOur last example of the family _Tortricidae_ is _Lecheana_, a moth that\r\nis common in most parts in June and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227.--LECHEANA.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are brown, lighter towards the base. There are no very\r\ndistinct markings, but there is generally a darker patch in the middle\r\nof the wing, edged with a silvery streak on each side.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on several trees, including oaks and elms, in the month\r\nof May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Penthina pruniana_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.--PRUNIANA.]\r\n\r\nThe next family--_Penthinidae_--contains the common species _Pruniana_,\r\nwhich may be readily known by its boldly marked wings. The basal portion\r\nof the fore wings, to the extent of nearly two-thirds of the whole, is\r\nvery dark brown. The remaining third is almost white, and clouded with\r\ngrey. The hind wings are smoky brown with a paler fringe.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species feeds on the blackthorn (_Prunus\r\nspinosa_) in May, and the moth flies in June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antithesia salicella_\r\n\r\nThis moth is not nearly so common as the last species, but is fairly\r\nplentiful in some localities in the south of England. It belongs to the\r\nsame family as _Pruniana_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.--SALICELLA.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are whitish at the base and along the inner margin, but\r\nthe light tint is dotted and clouded with shades of brown. The remainder\r\nof the wings is marbled with dark brown of different depths, relieved\r\nnear the hind margin with a little blue. The hind wings, as is usual\r\nwith the _Tortrices_, are dull smoky brown.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is reddish brown with black spots, and feeds during May\r\nin rolled leaves of willows.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sciaphila octomaculana_\r\n\r\nOur single example of the family _Sciaphilidae_ is the species\r\n_Octomaculana_, which, though not very abundant, is widely distributed,\r\nand moderately common in parts.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are white, dusted with grey, and each is marked with four\r\ndark grey patches which have given rise to its specific name--a word\r\nwhich signifies 'eight-spotted.' The hind wings are grey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.--OCTOMACULANA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on thistles and other plants, and the moth flies\r\nfrom August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ephippiphora cirsiana_\r\n\r\nThis insect represents the family _Grapholithidae_. It is a common moth,\r\nand is widely distributed.\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are greyish brown, with a large white patch on the middle\r\nof the inner margin; and beyond this white, in the anal angle, is a\r\npale grey patch containing three or four black dots. The tips of the\r\nwings are reddish brown.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in June and July; and the larva, which feeds on thistles,\r\nmay be found in the stems from October to the following May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.--CIRSIANA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carpocapsa pomonella_\r\n\r\nThe same extensive family contains a few moths that are very destructive\r\nto our fruits, the larvae burrowing into and living entirely within their\r\nsubstance. One of these--_Pomonella_--is popularly known as the Codlin,\r\nas its larva is so often found in the interior of small apples of the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.--POMONELLA.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings of this insect are grey, with a number of dark transverse\r\nlines. The spot in the anal angle is edged with a coppery tint, and\r\ninclosed by a curved black line.\r\n\r\nThis moth is common in all parts, flying during June and July; and the\r\nlarva may be looked for in apples and pears in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xanthosetia zoegana_\r\n\r\nOur last example of the _Tortrices_ is _Zoegana_, which belongs to the\r\nfamily _Conchylidae_. Its fore wings are yellow, with a reddish streak\r\nalong the costa near the base, and a small reddish spot opposite this\r\nnear the inner margin. The tip of the wings is dark reddish brown, in\r\nthe middle of which is a large yellow spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.--ZOEGANA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nThis moth is widely distributed, and in some parts common. It flies from\r\nMay to August, and the larva feeds on the small scabious (_Scabiosa\r\ncolumbaria_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tineae_\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that the _Tortrices_ form a very extensive group of\r\nmoths, but they are far outnumbered by the _Tineae_, for of these there\r\nare over seven hundred known British species.\r\n\r\nOf course, among so many species we are sure to find considerable\r\nvariety in form and structure; but notwithstanding this, the _Tineae_\r\nform a well-marked division, and the beginner will find but little\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing between these and the other Micros.\r\n\r\nThe wings are long and narrow, and are remarkable for the length of the\r\nfringe, particularly that of the hind wings. The bodies, too, are long\r\nand slender.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are exceedingly variable. Some have the usual number of\r\nsixteen limbs, and others have as many as eighteen. Again, the larvae of\r\nseveral genera have only fourteen legs, and some are absolutely legless.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their food and habits, they are equally variable, for\r\nwhile some feed exposed, others are always protected in rolled leaves.\r\nSome construct for themselves portable tubes, so that they always remain\r\nunder cover, and are at the same time perfectly free to ramble in search\r\nfor food. Some, also, are leaf miners; and the group includes the\r\nso-called 'Clothes Moths,' whose larvae devour our garments, furs, and\r\nthe upholstering of our furniture.\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly notice a few species, in order that we may become\r\nbetter acquainted with the general characters of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diurnea fagella_\r\n\r\nThis moth represents the small family _Epigraphiidae_, containing only\r\nsix species, all of which appear in the winter or early spring.\r\n\r\nThe present species is very common in most parts, and may be seen at\r\nrest on the barks of trees in March and April.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.--FAGELLA.]\r\n\r\nThe fore wings are usually pale grey or yellowish grey, and dotted with\r\nbrown; but there is a great variety both in the depth of the ground\r\ncolour and the distinctness of the markings. Our illustration gives the\r\nusual appearance of the insect.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar feeds on various trees in September and October, always\r\nprotected between leaves that it has spun together.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adela cuprella_\r\n\r\nThe family _Adelidae_ contains ten species, all remarkable for the great\r\nlength of their antennae. The one selected for illustration is a\r\nbeautiful little moth with bright bronzy green fore wings, tinged with a\r\nrich glossy violet. The hind wings are brown with a glossy surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.--CUPRELLA.]\r\n\r\nThis moth does not seem to be widely distributed, but is fairly\r\nplentiful where it occurs. Wimbledon Common and Epping Forest are good\r\nlocalities for it. It is on the wing in April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hyponomeuta Padellus_\r\n\r\nThe family _Hyponomeutidae_ contains about twenty insects, some of which\r\nare very common and exceedingly destructive to our trees. In May and\r\nJune hawthorn and fruit trees may be seen swarming with the gregarious\r\nlarvae of some of them, and almost entirely stripped of their leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.--PADELLUS.]\r\n\r\nThe species here figured has grey or white fore wings with three rows of\r\nblack dots. The hind wings are darker grey without dots.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on hawthorn, apple, and other trees. The perfect insect\r\nflies in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Depressaria nervosa_\r\n\r\nThe next family--_Gelechiidae_--is represented by the species Nervosa,\r\nwhich is common in many localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.--NERVOSA--TWICE NATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nIts fore wings are reddish brown, and are marked by a number of short\r\nlongitudinal streaks of a darker colour. The hind wings are light grey.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar is black, marked with black spots in white rings, and\r\nhaving yellow side stripes. It feeds on the flowers of the hemlock\r\nwater dropwort (_[OE]nanthe crocata_) during June and July.\r\n\r\nThe moth flies in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harpella Geoffrella_\r\n\r\nThe same extensive family contains the moth Geoffrella, represented in\r\nthe accompanying cut. This is an exceedingly pretty insect. The basal\r\nportion of its fore wings is yellow, with two longitudinal dark streaks,\r\nthe outer one of which is bent towards the inner margin near the middle\r\nof the wing. The remaining portion of the wings is brown, with two\r\nyellowish triangular spots, one on the costal and one on the inner\r\nmargin. On the middle of the costa is a short dark streak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238.--GEOFFRELLA.]\r\n\r\nThis moth appears in May and June, and is rather local, but very\r\nabundant in some parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coleophora ibipennella_\r\n\r\nThe family _Coleophoridae_ contains about seventy small moths,\r\ncharacterised by their very narrow and pointed wings, with long fringes,\r\nand also, generally, by a little tuft of hair on the first joint of the\r\nantennae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239.--IBIPENNELLA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nThe larvae live in little cases which they construct, and feed on various\r\nleaves and seeds. They spend the winter within their cases, and change\r\nto the chrysalis state in spring or early summer.\r\n\r\nOne of these moths--_Ibipennella_--is shown in fig. 239. Its fore wings\r\nare white, with a satiny gloss, and brownish towards the tips. The\r\n'nervures' are generally of a yellowish tinge. The hind wings are dark\r\ngrey.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on the birch (_Betula alba_), and may be seen walking on\r\nthe surface of the leaves, carrying, or rather dragging after it, the\r\npistol-shaped case in which it lives, nothing protruding save its head\r\nand front legs. It is full fed in May, and the moth flies in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tischeria complanella_\r\n\r\nThis species represents the rather extensive family _Elachistidae_, the\r\nmembers of which have narrow and pointed wings. Many of them are adorned\r\nwith beautiful metallic tints, but are generally so small that a lens is\r\nnecessary to show up the splendour of their clothing. Most of the larvae\r\nare leaf miners, and are easily reared. All that is necessary is to\r\npluck a few twigs, the leaves of which, when held up to the light,\r\nreveal the tiny larvae in their burrows, and place them in a vessel of\r\nwater. They do not feed long, and it is probable that most of the larvae\r\nso treated will be ready to change before the leaves have become dry.\r\nThe present species has bright yellow fore wings, with pale grey\r\ncloudings at the hind margins. It is very abundant in many parts, and\r\nflies during the month of June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240.--COMPLANELLA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nThe larva is one of the numerous leaf miners, and is of a yellowish\r\ncolour. It feeds in oak leaves during the autumn, and its presence is\r\nindicated by light blotches on the foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nepticula aurella_\r\n\r\nThe family _Nepticulidae_--the last of the _Tineae_--contains a number of\r\nlittle moths, including the smallest of the _Lepidoptera_. Many of them\r\nare exceedingly beautiful, being decorated with various tints of a\r\nsplendid metallic lustre, but their beauty is revealed only by the use\r\nof a magnifying lens, and they are so small that very great care and\r\npatience is required to set them properly.\r\n\r\nThey may be recognised by their short and thick antennae, rather large\r\nhead, broad fore wings, and narrow pointed hind wings.\r\n\r\nThe larvae have no true legs, but have nine pairs of very imperfectly\r\ndeveloped claspers. They are leaf miners, and are sometimes so abundant\r\nthat several may be found in a single leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.--AURELLA--ENLARGED.]\r\n\r\nThe species we have selected has fore wings of a rich golden brown, with\r\ndeep violet tips, and a broad bar of pale golden yellow beyond the\r\nmiddle. It may be found throughout the spring and summer. The larva\r\nexcavates long irregular burrows in the leaves of the bramble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nI have previously called the reader's attention to our classified list\r\nof butterflies and moths, and have hinted at one or two of the objects\r\nfor which it is inserted. It contains the scientific and popular names\r\nof all the British Butterflies, _Sphinges_, _Bombyces_, _Noctuae_, and\r\n_Geometrae_, arranged in their various families and genera; and in cases\r\nwhere two specific names are commonly applied to the same insect, both\r\nare given.\r\n\r\nIts chief uses to the young entomologist are to show the relation which\r\nthe insects bear one to another, and to supply a guide for the proper\r\narrangement of the specimens in his cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe order adopted is that of South's 'Synonymic List of British\r\nLepidoptera,' and it has already been mentioned that similar lists,\r\nprinted on one side of the paper only, may be obtained from dealers in\r\nnaturalists' appliances. These, cut up as required, supply very neat\r\nlabels for cabinets or store boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_COMPLETE CLASSIFIED LIST OF BRITISH MACRO-LEPIDOPTERA_\r\n\r\n=RHOPALOCERA (BUTTERFLIES).=\r\n\r\n

various butterflies\r\nand moths generally appear, and of the localities which they are known\r\nto frequent. The experiences he has gained in the past enable him to\r\ncalculate on the probabilities of the future, and he chooses both time\r\nand locality according to his requirements.\r\n\r\nAs he makes his way to the hunting ground he counts over the chances of\r\nmeeting with a certain insect that is wanted to fill a long-standing\r\nblank in his cabinet; and we hear him discussing the probabilities as to\r\nwhether this species is yet 'out,' or whether the larvae of that species\r\nare feeding.\r\n\r\nHow different it is with the young and unguided entomologist! He rambles\r\npromiscuously here and there, having only the faintest idea as to what\r\nhe is likely to see, and perhaps meeting with only four or five species\r\nwhen an experienced collector, without covering a larger area of ground,\r\nwould take scores in the same time.\r\n\r\nIn order to afford some little help to the beginner, I have thought it\r\nadvisable to introduce a calendar of operations to guide him in his\r\nwork. The space at our command would not allow this to be carried out in\r\ndetail, but the general instructions will undoubtedly assist most of my\r\nreaders until the practical experience gained by a few years' work has\r\nenabled them to run on their own legs.\r\n\r\nOf course, in making reference to the monthly lists of insects on the\r\nwing, allowance must be made for the forwardness or backwardness of the\r\nseasons. Thus, an insect entered in the April list _may_ appear in March\r\nin an exceptionally warm season, but may not emerge till the early part\r\nof May if the spring has been unusually severe.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in cases where all the species of a certain\r\ngenus or family appear on the wing in the same month, the name of that\r\ngenus or family is entered on the list instead of the names of the\r\nindividual species; but the latter can easily be obtained by reference\r\nto Appendix I.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY\r\n\r\nThere is not much field work to be done during this month. If the\r\nweather is very severe, hardly an insect will be found on the wing; but\r\na mild January will sometimes entice the Brimstone Butterfly (_Rhamni_)\r\nand some of the hybernating Vanessas from their winter quarters.\r\n\r\nHybernating moths may also be met with, on the wing if the weather\r\nis mild, or sleeping in their sheltered nooks during the frosts.\r\nThese include several _Noctuae_--_Auricoma_, _Lithargyria_,\r\n_Suffusa_, _Vaccinii_, _Spadicea_, _Erythrocephala_, _Satellitia_,\r\n_Rubiginea_, _Croceago_, _Vetusta_, _Exoleta_, _Ornithopus_,\r\n_Furcifera_, _Semibrunnea_, _Socia_, and _Libatrix_; and also a few\r\n_Geometrae_--_Zonaria_, _Fluviata_, _Dubitata_, _Siterata_, and _Miata_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these hybernating insects, the collector may examine tree\r\ntrunks and fences for the Early Moth (_Rupicapraria_), and late\r\nspecimens of the Winter Moth (_Brumata_); and towards the end of the\r\nmonth he may expect to meet with fresh specimens of the Pale Brindled\r\nBeauty (_Pedaria_) and the Spring Usher (_Leucophaearia_). A few of the\r\n_Tineae_ may also be seen.\r\n\r\nThe net need not be used at all during the colder months of the year, as\r\nthe moths are easily taken in pill boxes from the trunks and fences on\r\nwhich they rest.\r\n\r\nPupa digging may be carried on throughout the month if the weather is\r\nsufficiently mild, but it is of no use attempting this during a frost.\r\nHybernating larvae may also be searched out of their winter quarters if\r\nthe collector does not mind giving them the attention they require; but,\r\nas a rule, it is better to wait till they themselves start out to feed\r\nin the spring, at which time all their food plants are showing leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY\r\n\r\nOur remarks under 'January' concerning pupa digging and other work apply\r\nequally well to this month. The same hybernating butterflies and moths\r\nmay be looked for; and, in addition to _Pedaria_, _Leucophaearia_, and\r\n_Rupicapraria_, which now appear more plentifully, the following species\r\nwill probably be seen:\r\n\r\n  Small Eggar (_Lanestris_)\r\n  Small Brindled Beauty (_Hispidaria_)\r\n  Oak Beauty (_Strataria_)\r\n  Dotted Border (_Marginaria_)\r\n  March Moth (_AEscularia_)\r\n\r\nAbout half a dozen species of the _Tineae_ will also have made their\r\nappearance before the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH\r\n\r\nMany of the hybernating larvae will come out during March if the weather\r\nis mild, and commence to feed; and the young caterpillars will begin to\r\nappear from the eggs of the early moths already named. This is\r\nconsequently a good time to commence the search for larvae if you intend\r\nto go in for rearing. During the daytime some may be beaten from the\r\nboughs of trees and shrubs; and those which feed on low plants, being\r\ngenerally nocturnal in their habits, should be searched for in the\r\nevening, after dark, with the aid of a lantern.\r\n\r\nThe hybernating butterflies are now flying more freely than before, and,\r\nif the weather is bright and warm for the time of year, a few freshly\r\nemerged species may be seen. These may possibly include:\r\n\r\n  Large White (_Brassicae_)\r\n  Small White (_Rapae_)\r\n  Green-veined White (_Napi_)\r\n  Holly Blue (_Argiolus_)\r\n\r\nAs regards moths, several fresh species may be expected to appear, while\r\nthose named as appearing in February are still to be found. The\r\nnew-comers may include:\r\n\r\n  =Bombyces.=\r\n    Kentish Glory (_Versicolor_)\r\n    Yellow-horned (_Flavicornis_)\r\n\r\n  =Noctuae.=\r\n    Pine Beauty (_Piniperda_)\r\n    White-marked Rustic (_Leucographa_)\r\n    Red Chestnut (_Rubricosa_)\r\n    All species of the genus _Taeniocampa_\r\n    Early Grey (_Areola_)\r\n    Green-brindled Dot (_Oleagina_)\r\n    Orange Underwing (_Parthenias_)\r\n    Light Orange Underwing (_Notha_)\r\n\r\n  =Geometrae.=\r\n    Early Thorn (_Bilunaria_)\r\n    Engrailed (_Biundularia_)\r\n    Mottled Grey (_Multistrigaria_)\r\n\r\nSugaring may be commenced towards the end of March, and sallow blossom\r\nmay be searched in the evening, but it is probable that only a few\r\nspecies will be taken by these means.\r\n\r\nA few more species of the _Tineae_ appear in March, and four or five of\r\nthe _Tortrices_ are out before the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL\r\n\r\nThis is really a busy month with the entomologist, and it will be\r\nnecessary to put all apparatus and appliances into perfect order early.\r\nThe cyanide bottle should be freshly charged, nets examined and repaired\r\nif necessary, and all setting boards, breeding cages &c. put in perfect\r\ntrim for the new season's work.\r\n\r\nLarvae are now feeding freely, and a few hours spent in beating,\r\nsweeping, and searching will enable you to stock your cages liberally.\r\n\r\nSugaring may be continued throughout the month, and the sallow blossom\r\nmay be searched as long as it proves attractive. Moths may also be\r\nattracted by light at night.\r\n\r\nThe following butterflies are generally out during April, in addition to\r\nthe hybernated species already named:\r\n\r\n  Large White (_Brassicae_)\r\n  Small White (_Rapae_)\r\n  Green-veined White (_Napi_)\r\n  Orange Tip (_Cardamines_)\r\n  Wood White (_Sinapis_)\r\n  Pearl-bordered Fritillary (_Euphrosyne_)\r\n  Speckled Wood (_Egeria_)\r\n  Green Hairstreak (_Rubi_)\r\n  Small Copper (_Phl[oe]as_)\r\n  Holly Blue (_Argiolus_)\r\n  Grizzled Skipper (_Malvae_)\r\n  Dingy Skipper (_Tages_)\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the principal moths for April:\r\n\r\n  =Bombyces.=\r\n    Small Lappet (_Ilicifolia_)\r\n    Kentish Glory (_Versicolor_)\r\n    Yellow Horned (_Flavicornis_)\r\n    Frosted Green (_Ridens_)\r\n\r\n  =Noctuae.=\r\n    Pine Beauty (_Piniperda_)\r\n    White-marked Rustic (_Leucographa_)\r\n    Red Chestnut (_Rubricosa_)\r\n    All species of the genus _Taeniocampa_\r\n    Early Grey (_Areola_)\r\n    Mullein Shark (_Verbasci_)\r\n    Orange Underwing (_Parthenias_)\r\n    Light Orange Underwing (_Notha_)\r\n\r\n  =Geometrae.=\r\n    Brimstone (_Luteolata_)\r\n    Early Thorn (_Bilunaria_)\r\n    Belted Beauty (_Zonaria_)\r\n    Brindled Beauty (_Hirtaria_)\r\n    Waved Umber (_Abruptaria_)\r\n    Small Engrailed (_Crepuscularia_)\r\n    Engrailed (_Biundularia_)\r\n    Sloe Carpet (_Pictaria_)\r\n    Netted Mountain (_Carbonaria_)\r\n    Mottled Grey (_Multistrigaria_)\r\n    Satyr Pug (_Satyrata_)\r\n    Marbled Pug (_Irriguata_)\r\n    Campanula Pug (_Campanulata_)\r\n    Brindled Pug (_Abbreviata_)\r\n    Oak-tree Pug (_Dodoneata_)\r\n    Double-striped Pug (_Pumilata_)\r\n    Early Tooth-striped (_Carpinata_)\r\n    Shoulder Stripe (_Badiata_)\r\n    Many-lined (_Polygrammata_)\r\n    Tissue (_Dubitata_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, a few species of the _Tortrices_, several of\r\nthe _Tineae_, and one or two of the Plume Moths (_Pterophori_) are out\r\nduring April.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing will be obtained by digging during May, yet a number\r\nof pupae may be found among grass and leaves under trees, and also\r\nattached to the leaves and stems of low plants. These pupae include those\r\nof several of the butterflies, among which may be mentioned _Machaon_,\r\n_Selene_, _Euphrosyne_, _Aurinia_, _Megaera_, _Ianira_, _Rubi_,\r\n_Astrarche_, _Icarus_, _Bellargus_, _Corydon_, _Lucina_, and _Sylvanus_.\r\n\r\nLarvae may now be taken in abundance by beating the boughs of oaks and\r\nother trees, and also by examining low plants.\r\n\r\nThe hybernating butterflies are still on the wing, and the following are\r\nalso out:\r\n\r\n  Swallow Tail (_Machaon_)\r\n  Large White (_Brassicae_)\r\n  Small White (_Rapae_)\r\n  Green-veined White (_Napi_)\r\n  Bath White (_Daplidice_)\r\n  Orange Tip (_Cardamines_)\r\n  Wood White (_Sinapis_)\r\n  Small Pearl-bordered (_Selene_)\r\n  Pearl-bordered (_Euphrosyne_)\r\n  Greasy Fritillary (_Aurinia_)\r\n  Glanville Fritillary (_Cinxia_)\r\n  Speckled Wood (_Egeria_)\r\n  Wall (_Megaera_)\r\n  Marsh Ringlet (_Typhon_)\r\n  Small Heath (_Pamphilus_)\r\n  Green Hairstreak (_Rubi_)\r\n  Small Copper (_Phl[oe]as_)\r\n  Brown Argus (_Astrarche_)\r\n  Common Blue (_Icarus_)\r\n  Clifden Blue (_Bellargus_)\r\n  Holly Blue (_Argiolus_)\r\n  Mazarine Blue (_Semiargus_)\r\n  Grizzled Skipper (_Malvae_)\r\n  Chequered Skipper (_Palaemon_)\r\n\r\nThere is a great increase in the number of moths this month, and much\r\ngood work may be done by means of light traps and by the examination of\r\nfences. Many moths are driven from their resting places early in the\r\nmorning by the direct rays of the rising sun, and then seek out a spot\r\nwhere they are better sheltered, and where they are consequently less\r\neasily found. Hence the advantage of searching fences early in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe May list includes:\r\n\r\n  =Sphinges.=\r\n    Small Elephant (_Porcellus_)\r\n    All species of the genera _Smerinthus_ and _Macroglossa_\r\n    Some of the Clearwings (_Apiformis_, _Sphegiformis_, and\r\n      _Culiciformis_)\r\n    Cream-bordered Green (_Chlorana_)\r\n    Green Silver-lined (_Prasinana_)\r\n\r\n  =Bombyces.=\r\n    Wood Tiger (_Plantaginis_)\r\n    Muslin Moth (_Mendica_)\r\n    Common Swift (_Lupulinus_)\r\n    Pale Tussock (_Pudibunda_)\r\n    Small Lappet (_Ilicifolia_)\r\n    Emperor (_Pavonia_)\r\n    All species of family _Drepanulidae_\r\n    Alder Kitten (_Bicuspis_)\r\n    Puss (_Vinula_)\r\n    Several of the 'Prominents' (_Cuculla_, _Carmelita_, _Dictaea_,\r\n      _Dictaeoides_, _Trilophus_, _Ziczac_, _Trepida_, _Chaonia_,\r\n      _Trimacula_)\r\n    Chocolate Tip (_Curtula_)\r\n    Small Chocolate Tip (_Pigra_)\r\n\r\n  =Noctuae.=\r\n    Knot Grass (_Rumicis_)\r\n    Sweet Gale (_Myricae_)\r\n    White Colon (_Albicolon_)\r\n    Cabbage (_Brassicae_)\r\n    Treble Lines (_Trigrammica_)\r\n    Marsh Moth (_Palustris_)\r\n    Light Brocade (_Genistae_)\r\n    Mullein Shark (_Verbasci_)\r\n    Betony Shark (_Scrophulariae_)\r\n    Starwort Shark (_Asteris_)\r\n    Camomile Shark (_Chamomillae_)\r\n    Small Dark Yellow Underwing (_Cordigera_)\r\n    Small Yellow Underwing (_Tenebrata_)\r\n    Bordered Sallow (_Umbra_)\r\n    Lunar Double Stripe (_Lunaris_)\r\n\r\n  =Geometrae.=\r\n    Brimstone (_Luteolata_)\r\n    Speckled Yellow (_Macularia_)\r\n    Purple Thorn (_Tetralunaria_)\r\n    Scalloped Hazel (_Bidentata_)\r\n    Brindled Beauty (_Hirtaria_)\r\n    Peppered (_Betularia_)\r\n    Waved Umber (_Abruptaria_)\r\n    Ringed Carpet (_Cinctaria_)\r\n    Square Spot (_Consonaria_)\r\n    Small Engrailed (_Crepuscularia_)\r\n    Engrailed (_Biundularia_)\r\n    Grey Birch (_Punctularia_)\r\n    Small Grass Emerald (_Viridata_)\r\n    All species of family _Ephyridae_\r\n    Cream Wave (_Remutaria_)\r\n    White Wave (_Pusaria_)\r\n    Round-winged Wave (_Rotundaria_)\r\n    Common Wave (_Exanthemata_)\r\n    Clouded Silver (_Temerata_)\r\n    White-pinion Spotted (_Bimaculata_)\r\n    Latticed Heath (_Clathrata_)\r\n    Brown Silver-line (_Petraria_)\r\n    Barred Umber (_Pulveraria_)\r\n    Netted Mountain (_Carbonaria_)\r\n    Common Heath (_Atomaria_)\r\n    Bordered White (_Piniaria_)\r\n    Rest Harrow (_Ononaria_)\r\n    Yellow Belle (_Ochrearia_)\r\n    Clouded Border (_Marginata_)\r\n    Horse Chestnut (_Hippocastanaria_)\r\n    Pretty Pinion (_Adaequata_)\r\n    Pugs (_Venosata_, _Consignata_, _Pulchellata_, _Plumbeolata_,\r\n      _Satyrata_, _Castigata_, _Pusillata_, _Irriguata_, _Indigata_,\r\n      _Nanata_, _Vulgata_, _Assimilata_, _Exiguata_, _Coronata_)\r\n    Yellow-barred Brindle (_Viretata_)\r\n    Ruddy High-flier (_Ruberata_)\r\n    May High-flier (_Trifasciata_)\r\n    Common Carpet (_Sociata_)\r\n    Silver-ground Carpet (_Montanata_)\r\n    Streamer (_Nigrofasciaria_)\r\n    Barberry Carpet (_Berberata_)\r\n    Flame Carpet (_Designata_)\r\n    Twin-spot Carpets (_Ferrugata_ and _Unidentaria_)\r\n    Scarce Tissue (_Certata_)\r\n    Water Carpet (_Suffumata_)\r\n    Small Ph[oe]nix (_Silaceata_)\r\n    Oblique-striped (_Virgata_)\r\n    Broom Tip (_Rufata_)\r\n\r\nA number of the Micros are also out this month. About twenty species of\r\nthe _Pyralides_, one or two of the _Pterophori_, a few _Crambi_, about\r\nfifty of the _Tortrices_, and no less than two hundred of the _Tineae_.\r\nThe collector will do well to search fences and tree trunks for these\r\nmoths, whenever he has the opportunity; and also to use the net freely\r\nin wooded country, waste places, and along hedgerows, _before_ and at\r\ndusk.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE\r\n\r\nThere is a marked increase in winged insect life during this month. The\r\nearly butterflies are disappearing, or perhaps have quite left us; but\r\nnew species are taking their place. The _Sphinges_ now reach their\r\nmaximum, as do also the _Bombyces_; and the other groups are almost if\r\nnot quite up to their highest total. The _Noctuae_ and _Geometrae_ each\r\namount to over a hundred species. No less than a hundred and fifty\r\nBritish _Tortrices_ are on the wing; the _Tineae_ make a near approach to\r\nthree hundred, and the _Pyralides_ of the month are not far short of\r\nnumbering a hundred species. It will thus be seen that the net and pill\r\nboxes, as well as the setting boards, are in constant demand.\r\n\r\nDull days may be well occupied in beating for moths, and in the\r\nexamination of fences and the bark of trees; and on bright days, as soon\r\nas the butterflies have settled down to rest, the same work may be\r\ncarried on till dusk.\r\n\r\nMicros and _Geometrae_ are out early in the evening, when they should be\r\ntaken with the net. Later on the _Noctuae_ may be seen playing round\r\ntheir favourite flowers.\r\n\r\nSugar and light traps are likely to do good service during June, and\r\ndecoy females of the _Bombyces_ group may be called to your aid.\r\n\r\nLarvae are also abundant during June, and those of most of the\r\nbutterflies may be taken by carefully searching their food plants.\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of imagines for the month:\r\n\r\n  =Butterflies.=\r\n    Swallow Tail (_Machaon_)\r\n    Black-veined White (_Crataegi_)\r\n    Large White (_Brassicae_)\r\n    Small White (_Rapae_)\r\n    Green-veined

very numerous, some being second broods of\r\ndouble-brooded species, and others late single-brooded insects.\r\n\r\n_Sphinges_ are beginning to fall off, and so are the _Bombyces_, but the\r\n_Noctuae_ and _Geometrae_ are slightly on the increase.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Micros, a good number of fresh species may be expected,\r\nall the groups exhibiting a marked increase in the total number on the\r\nwing with the exception of the _Tineae_.\r\n\r\nSugaring is likely to pay well this month, and many moths may be\r\nattracted by light. Tree trunks and fences should be well examined.\r\n\r\nPupae may certainly be taken, but unless the collector is particularly\r\ndesirous of obtaining the pupae of insects known to be now passing\r\nthrough that stage, he will probably do better by looking after\r\nimagines.\r\n\r\nLarvae, however, may well receive a little attention, providing the\r\nsetting of butterflies and moths leave a little leisure for other\r\nemployments. Beating by day, and searching by both day and night, even\r\nif carried on only occasionally, will probably supply you with as many\r\nspecies as you can accommodate in your glasses and cages.\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of the month are:\r\n\r\n  Swallow Tail (_Machaon_)\r\n  Black-veined White (_Crataegi_)\r\n  Large White (_Brassicae_)\r\n  Small White (_Rapae_)\r\n  Green-veined White

during August, yet there remains plenty of work for\r\nthe lepidopterist.\r\n\r\nMany of the butterflies of July continue to fly during the whole or part\r\nof this month, and several fresh species commence their flight. August,\r\ntoo, may be looked upon as _the_ month for second broods, and an\r\nopportunity now arises for searching for some of the species that were\r\nmissed at the time of their early appearance in May. Clover and lucerne\r\nfields should be well worked.\r\n\r\nA few _Sphinges_ and a number of the _Bombyces_ are still on the wing.\r\nThe _Noctuae_ are on the decrease, but there are yet nearly a hundred\r\nspecies (including the rarer ones) at large.\r\n\r\nThese last may be taken at sugar in considerable numbers, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that two of the Vanessas (_Atalanta_ and _Cardui_)\r\nmay be caught sipping on your baited trees during the daytime.\r\n\r\n_Geometrae_ and Micros fall off very considerably this month, but these,\r\nas well as moths of the other groups, may be taken from tree trunks and\r\npalings. Light traps may also be used with much success during August.\r\n\r\nFallen fruits should be examined for the larvae that feed within them;\r\nand late in the month ripe fruit will supply food to the lovers of\r\nsweets.\r\n\r\nIvy blossom should be well worked at night; and clover and lucerne\r\nfields form admirable hunting grounds for moths at night, especially\r\njust after rain.\r\n\r\nLarvae are to be obtained in abundance by beating and searching, the\r\nlatter process being conducted by night as well as by day.\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of imagines for August:\r\n\r\n

is now considerably lower, yet there\r\nis a good deal to be done both with butterflies and moths.\r\n\r\nMany of the former are worn and ragged, but good fresh specimens of some\r\nspecies may be taken. Clover and lucerne fields and the flowery borders\r\nof corn fields remain very attractive.\r\n\r\nTree trunks and palings should be searched as before. Sugar still\r\nattracts numbers of the _Noctuae_; and ivy blossom should be examined at\r\nnight whenever an opportunity offers itself.\r\n\r\nSeptember is a good month for larva hunting. Most of the species that\r\npupate in the autumn are now full fed, and will undergo the change to\r\nthe chrysalis state shortly after they have been housed, thus giving but\r\nlittle trouble to the entomologist. The day feeders may be beaten or\r\nswept from their food plants, but, of course, the nocturnal species are\r\nbest discovered by searching at night.\r\n\r\nSome have already 'gone down' for the winter, and, consequently, pupa\r\nhunting may be started. However, as there is yet much to be done with\r\nimagines and larvae, it may, perhaps, be better to leave the pupae alone\r\ntill about the end of the month, especially as many of the larvae have\r\nnot yet had time to complete their transformation.\r\n\r\nThe list of imagines for September includes:\r\n\r\n  =Butterflies.=\r\n    Clouded Yellow (_Edusa_)\r\n    Brimstone (_Rhamni_)\r\n    Queen of Spain (_Latona_)\r\n    Comma (_C-Album_)\r\n    Large Tortoiseshell (_Polychloros_)\r\n    Small Tortoiseshell (_Urticae_)\r\n    Peacock (_Io_)\r\n    Camberwell Beauty (_Antiopa_)\r\n    Red Admiral (_Atalanta_)\r\n    Painted Lady (_Cardui_)\r\n    Speckled Wood (_Egeria_)\r\n    Wall (_Megaera_)\r\n    Grayling (_Semele_)\r\n    Large Heath (_Tithonus_)\r\n    Small Heath (_Pamphilus_)\r\n    Small Copper (_Phl[oe]as_)\r\n    Common Blue (_Icarus_)\r\n    Clifden Blue (_Bellargus_)\r\n    Chalk-hill Blue (_Corydon_)\r\n    Holly Blue (_Argiolus_)\r\n\r\n  =Sphinges.=\r\n    Death's-head Hawk (_Atropos_)\r\n    Convolvulus Hawk (_Convolvuli_)\r\n    Humming Bird Hawk (_Stellatarum_)\r\n\r\n  =Bombyces.=\r\n    Tortrix (_Undulanus_)\r\n    Crimson Speckled (_Pulchella_)\r\n    Vapourer (_Antiqua_)\r\n    Pale Oak Eggar (_Crataegi_)\r\n    Lesser Lutestring (_Diluta_)\r\n\r\n  =Noctuae.=\r\n    Figure of Eight (_Caeruleocephala_)\r\n    Small Wainscot (_Fulva_)\r\n    Bullrush (_Arundinis_)\r\n    Large Wainscot (_Lutosa_)\r\n    Frosted Orange (_Ochracea_)\r\n    Rosy Rustic (_Micacea_)\r\n    Feathered Brindle (_Australis_)\r\n    Beautiful Gothic (_Hispidus_)\r\n    Antler (_Graminis_)\r\n    Flounced Rustic (_Testacea_)\r\n    Hedge Rustic (_Cespitis_)\r\n    Haworth's Minor (_Haworthii_)\r\n    Anomalous (_Anomala_)\r\n    Shuttle-shaped Dart (_Puta_)\r\n    Dark Sword Grass (_Suffusa_)\r\n    Pearly Underwing (_Saucia_)\r\n    Turnip (_Segetum_)\r\n    Heart and Dart (_Exclamationis_)\r\n    Autumn Rustic (_Glareosa_)\r\n    Mouse (_Tragopogonis_)\r\n    Red-lined Quaker (_Lota_)\r\n    Yellow-lined Quaker (_Macilenta_)\r\n    Genus _Anchocelis_\r\n    Genus _Xanthia_\r\n    Centre-barred Sallow (_Xerampelina_)\r\n    Double Kidney (_Retusa_)\r\n    Genus _Polia_\r\n    Black Rustic (_Nigra_)\r\n    Green-brindled Crescent (_Oxyacanthae_)\r\n    Marvel-du-jour (_Aprilina_)\r\n    Angle Shades (_Meticulosa_)\r\n    Flame Brocade (_Flammea_)\r\n    Brindled Green (_Protea_)\r\n    Genus _Calocampa_\r\n    Genus _Xylina_\r\n    Herald (_Libatrix_)\r\n    Gold Spot (_Festucae_)\r\n    Silver Y (_Gamma_)\r\n    Scarce Bordered Straw (_Armigera_)\r\n    Clifden Nonpareil (_Fraxini_)\r\n    Buttoned Snout (_Rostralis_)\r\n\r\n  =Geometrae.=\r\n    Bordered Beauty (_Apiciaria_)\r\n    Brimstone (_Luteolata_)\r\n    Genus _Eugonia_\r\n    November (_Dilutata_)\r\n    Autumnal (_Filigrammaria_)\r\n    Juniper Pug (_Sobrinata_)\r\n    Shaded Broad Bar (_Variata_)\r\n    Slender-striped Rufous (_Lapidata_)\r\n    Tissue (_Dubitata_)\r\n    Carpets (_Siderata_, _Miata_, _Immanata_)\r\n    Chevron (_Testata_)\r\n    Mallow (_Cervinata_)\r\n    Streak (_Spartiata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER\r\n\r\nAs there is very little winged life this month, and the larvae have\r\nnearly all sought out their winter quarters, special attention may be\r\ngiven to pupae. The earlier this work is started after the insects have\r\ncompleted their change the better. If left late, many pupae will have\r\nbeen destroyed by floods, moles, &c., and a prolonged series of frosty\r\ndays may render digging unproductive if not impossible. Again, it must\r\nbe remembered that some larvae are not yet down, and by digging at the\r\nroots of the trees on which they are feeding, you are preparing an\r\nacceptable bed for the late species, for the pupae of which you may call\r\nagain in about a month.\r\n\r\nLarvae may be obtained by beating and searching as before, but this work\r\nshould be done as early in the month as possible, since but few are\r\nfeeding after the first week or so.\r\n\r\nButterfly catching is now practically over, only a few of the late\r\nspecies and the hybernators being on the wing, and these only on mild\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_Noctuae_ are still attracted by sugar and ivy blossom, and a few may be\r\nfound at rest. _Geometrae_ and Micros may be taken from palings and tree\r\ntrunks by day, or caught flying at dusk.\r\n\r\nThe imagines of October may include the following butterflies:\r\n\r\n  Brimstone (_Rhamni_)\r\n  Pale Clouded Yellow (_Hyale_)\r\n  Clouded Yellow (_Edusa_)\r\n  Comma (_C-Album_)\r\n  Large Tortoiseshell (_Polychloros_)\r\n  Small Tortoiseshell (_Urticae_)\r\n  Peacock (_Io_)\r\n  Camberwell Beauty (_Antiopa_)\r\n  Red Admiral (_Atalanta_)\r\n  Painted Lady (_Cardui_)\r\n  Small Copper (_Phl[oe]as_)\r\n\r\nAnd a few late 'Blues.'\r\n\r\nThe principal moths of the month are:\r\n\r\n  =Sphinges.=\r\n    Death's-head Hawk (_Atropos_)\r\n\r\n  =Bombyces.=\r\n    Plumed Prominent (_Plumigera_)\r\n\r\n  =Noctuae.=\r\n    Large Wainscot (_Lutosa_)\r\n    Red-lined Quaker (_Lota_)\r\n    Yellow-lined Quaker (_Macilenta_)\r\n    Beaded Chestnut (_Pistacina_)\r\n    Brown-spot Pinion (_Litura_)\r\n    Chestnut (_Vaccinii_)\r\n    Dark Chestnut (_Spadicea_)\r\n    Red-headed Chestnut (_Erythrocephala_)\r\n    Satellite (_Satellitia_)\r\n    Dotted Chestnut (_Rubiginea_)\r\n    Orange Upperwing (_Croceago_)\r\n    Brick (_Circellaris_)\r\n    Brindled Ochre (_Templi_)\r\n    Green Brindled Crescent (_Oxyacanthae_)\r\n    Marvel-du-jour (_Aprilina_)\r\n    Angle Shades (_Meticulosa_)\r\n    Flame Brocade (_Flammea_)\r\n    Red Sword-grass (_Vetusta_)\r\n    Sword-grass (_Exolita_)\r\n    Genus _Xylina_\r\n    Sprawler (_Sphinx_)\r\n    Silver Y (_Gamma_)\r\n\r\n  =Geometrae.=\r\n    Feathered Thorn (_Pennaria_)\r\n    Vestal (_Sacraria_)\r\n    Scarce Umber (_Aurantiaria_)\r\n    Mottled Umber (_Defoliaria_)\r\n    Winter (_Brumata_)\r\n    Northern Winter (_Boreata_)\r\n    November (_Dilutata_)\r\n    Juniper Carpet (_Juniperata_)\r\n    Gem (_Fluviata_)\r\n    Carpets (_Siderata_, _Miata_)\r\n    Mallow (_Cervinata_)\r\n    Streak (_Spartiata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER\r\n\r\nNo butterflies are to be seen this month with the exception of the\r\nhybernating species, and even these will not venture on the wing unless\r\nthe weather is mild and bright for the season.\r\n\r\nMost of the moths met with are also hybernators, but a few species are\r\nto be found only at this season, and these should be looked for on\r\nfences and tree trunks. A few _Noctuae_ may be taken at sugar, and the\r\n_Geometrae_ attracted by lights.\r\n\r\nThe only larvae now existing are hybernators, and many of these may be\r\nmet with during your pupa-digging operations; but they are best left\r\nalone till the spring, as a rule.\r\n\r\nThe chief work of the entomologist in November is certainly pupa\r\nhunting, and this may be carried on in real earnest whenever the weather\r\nis favourable, following the instructions given in Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, also, that many of the _Lepidoptera_ pass the\r\nwinter in the egg state, and search may be made for ova when time\r\npermits.\r\n\r\nThe November list, besides some of the hybernating species previously\r\nmentioned, include:\r\n\r\n  =Bombyces.=\r\n    December (_Populi_)\r\n\r\n  =Noctuae.=\r\n    Genus _Cerastis_\r\n    Satellite (_Satellitia_)\r\n    Dotted Chestnut (_Rubiginea_)\r\n    Orange Upperwing (_Croceago_)\r\n    Brindled Ochre (_Exempli_)\r\n\r\n  =Geometrae.=\r\n    Feathered Thorn (_Pennaria_)\r\n    Scarce Umber (_Aurantiaria_)\r\n    Mottled Umber (_Defoliaria_)\r\n    Winter (_Brumata_)\r\n    Northern Winter (_Boreata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER\r\n\r\nOutdoor work is now at a minimum. The weather is too severe, as a rule,\r\nto allow pupa digging to be carried on with either success or comfort,\r\nbut favourable opportunities should be seized for this employment as\r\nwell as for ova collecting.\r\n\r\nNow and again we may meet with _P. Populi_ at rest by day, or fluttering\r\nround a light at night. _Brumata_ and _Defoliaria_ may also be seen, and\r\nthe Early Moth (_Rupicapraria_) may appear on the wing before the new\r\nyear; but nothing is likely to be met with beyond these save the\r\nhybernators, already named in other lists, and some of the _Tineae_.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to utilise your spare time during the dreary months of\r\nwinter by attending to your cabinet. Rearrange your specimens where\r\nnecessary, and see that all are properly labelled; remove all greasy\r\nspecimens, and deal with them as recommended on page 127; also renew the\r\nsupply of camphor or naphthaline in your drawers and store boxes. Time\r\nmay also be found for the construction of apparatus that is likely to be\r\nrequired next season, and for repairing any that has been damaged during\r\nthe work of the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURED PLATES\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE I (_Frontispiece_)\r\n\r\n  1.
