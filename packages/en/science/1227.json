With this latter subject I am\r\nnot here concerned. The older treatises,[1] which I have consulted,\r\nhave been of little or no service to me. The famous ‘Conférences’[2] of\r\nthe painter Le Brun, published in 1667, is the best known ancient work,\r\nand contains some good remarks. Another somewhat old essay, namely, the\r\n‘Discours,’ delivered 1774-1782, by the well-known Dutch anatomist\r\nCamper,[3] can hardly be considered as having made any marked advance\r\nin the subject. The following works, on the contrary, deserve the\r\nfullest consideration.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Bell, so illustrious for his discoveries in physiology,\r\npublished in 1806 the first edition, and in the third edition of his\r\n‘Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression.’[4] He may with justice be said,\r\nnot only to have laid the foundations of the subject as a branch of\r\nscience, but to have built up a noble structure. His work is in every\r\nway deeply interesting; it includes graphic descriptions of the various\r\nemotions, and is admirably illustrated. It is generally admitted that\r\nhis service consists chiefly in having shown the intimate relation\r\nwhich exists between the movements of expression and those of\r\nrespiration. One of the most important points, small as it may at first\r\nappear, is that the muscles round the eyes are involuntarily contracted\r\nduring violent expiratory efforts, in order to protect these delicate\r\norgans from the pressure of the blood. This fact, which has been fully\r\ninvestigated for me with the greatest kindness by Professors Donders of\r\nUtrecht, throws, as we shall hereafter see, a flood of light on several\r\nof the most important expressions of the human countenance. The merits\r\nof Sir C. Bell’s work have been undervalued or quite ignored by several\r\nforeign writers, but have been fully admitted by some, for instance by\r\nM. Lemoine,[5] who with great justice says:—“Le livre de Ch. Bell\r\ndevrait être médité par quiconque essaye de faire parler le visage de\r\nl’homme, par les philosophes aussi bien que par les artistes, car, sous\r\nune apparence plus légère et sous le prétexte de l’esthétique, c’est un\r\ndes plus beaux monuments de la science des rapports du physique et du\r\nmoral.”\r\n\r\nFrom reasons which will presently be assigned, Sir C. Bell did not\r\nattempt to follow out his views as far as they might have been carried.\r\nHe does not try to explain why different muscles are brought into\r\naction under different emotions; why, for instance, the inner ends of\r\nthe eyebrows are raised, and the corners of the mouth depressed, by a\r\nperson suffering from grief or anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 M. Moreau edited an edition of Lavater on Physiognomy,[6] in\r\nwhich he incorporated several of his own essays, containing excellent\r\ndescriptions of the movements of the facial muscles, together with many\r\nvaluable remarks. He throws, however, very little light on the\r\nphilosophy of the subject. For instance, M. Moreau, in speaking of the\r\nact of frowning, that is, of the contraction of the muscle called by\r\nFrench writers the _soucilier_ (_corrigator supercilii_), remarks with\r\ntruth:—“Cette action des sourciliers est un des symptômes les plus\r\ntranchés de l’expression des affections pénibles ou concentrées.” He\r\nthen adds that these muscles, from their attachment and position, are\r\nfitted “à resserrer, à concentrer les principaux traits de la _face_,\r\ncomme il convient dans toutes ces passions vraiment oppressives ou\r\nprofondes, dans ces affections dont le sentiment semble porter\r\nl’organisation à revenir sur elle-même, à se contracter et à\r\n_s’amoindrir_, comme pour offrir moins de prise et de surface à des\r\nimpressions redoutables ou importunes.” He who thinks that remarks of\r\nthis kind throw any light on the meaning or origin of the different\r\nexpressions, takes a very different view of the subject to what I do.\r\n\r\nIn the above passage there is but a slight, if any, advance in the\r\nphilosophy of the subject, beyond that reached by the painter Le Brun,\r\nwho, in 1667, in describing the expression of fright, says:—“Le sourcil\r\nqui est abaissé d’un côté et élevé de l’autre, fait voir que la partie\r\nélevée semble le vouloir joindre au cerveau pour le garantir du mal que\r\nl’âme aperçoit, et le côté qui est abaissé et qui paraît enflé,—nous\r\nfait trouver dans cet état par les esprits qui viennent du cerveau en\r\nabondance, comme polir couvrir l’âme et la défendre du mal qu’elle\r\ncraint; la bouche fort ouverte fait voir le saisissement du cœur, par\r\nle sang qui se retire vers lui, ce qui l’oblige, voulant respirer, à\r\nfaire un effort qui est cause que la bouche s’ouvre extrêmement, et\r\nqui, lorsqu’il passe par les organes de la voix, forme un son qui n’est\r\npoint articulé; que si les muscles et les veines paraissent enflés, ce\r\nn’est que par les esprits que le cerveau envoie en ces parties-là.” I\r\nhave thought the foregoing sentences worth quoting, as specimens of the\r\nsurprising nonsense which has been written on the subject.\r\n\r\n‘The Physiology or Mechanism of Blushing,’ by Dr. Burgess, appeared in\r\n1839, and to this work I shall frequently refer in my thirteenth\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Dr. Duchenne published two editions, in folio and octavo, of\r\nhis ‘Mécanisme de la Physionomie Humaine,’ in which he analyses by\r\nmeans of electricity, and illustrates by magnificent photographs, the\r\nmovements of the facial muscles. He has generously permitted me to copy\r\nas many of his photographs as I desired. His works have been spoken\r\nlightly of, or quite passed over, by some of his countrymen. It is\r\npossible that Dr. Duchenne may have exaggerated the importance of the\r\ncontraction of single muscles in giving expression; for, owing to the\r\nintimate manner in which the muscles are connected, as may be seen in\r\nHenle’s anatomical drawings[7]—the best I believe ever published it is\r\ndifficult to believe in their separate action. Nevertheless, it is\r\nmanifest that Dr. Duchenne clearly apprehended this and other sources\r\nof error, and as it is known that he was eminently successful in\r\nelucidating the physiology of the muscles of the hand by the aid of\r\nelectricity, it is probable that he is generally in the right about the\r\nmuscles of the face. In my opinion, Dr. Duchenne has greatly advanced\r\nthe subject by his treatment of it. No one has more carefully studied\r\nthe contraction of each separate muscle, and the consequent furrows\r\nproduced on the skin. He has also, and this is a very important\r\nservice, shown which muscles are least under the separate control of\r\nthe will. He enters very little into theoretical considerations, and\r\nseldom attempts to explain why certain muscles and not others contract\r\nunder the influence of certain emotions.\r\n\r\nA distinguished French anatomist, Pierre Gratiolet, gave a course of\r\nlectures on Expression at the Sorbonne, and his notes were published\r\n(1865) after his death, under the title of ‘De la Physionomie et des\r\nMouvements d’Expression.’ This is a very interesting work, full of\r\nvaluable observations. His theory is rather complex, and, as far as it\r\ncan be given in a single sentence (p. 65), is as follows:—“Il résulte,\r\nde tous les faits que j’ai rappelés, que les sens, l’imagination et la\r\npensée elle-même, si élevée, si abstraite qu’on la suppose, ne peuvent\r\ns’exercer sans éveiller un sentiment corrélatif, et que ce sentiment se\r\ntraduit directement, sympathiquement, symboliquement ou\r\nmétaphoriquement, dans toutes les sphères des organs extérieurs, qui la\r\nracontent tous, suivant leur mode d’action propre, comme si chacun\r\nd’eux avait été directement affecté.”\r\n\r\nGratiolet appears to overlook inherited habit, and even to some extent\r\nhabit in the individual; and therefore he fails, as it seems to me, to\r\ngive the right explanation, or any explanation at all, of many gestures\r\nand expressions. As an illustration of what he calls symbolic\r\nmovements, I will quote his remarks (p. 37), taken from M. Chevreul, on\r\na man playing at billiards. “Si une bille dévie légèrement de la\r\ndirection que le joueur prétend lui imprimer, ne l’avez-vous pas vu\r\ncent fois la pousser du regard, de la tête et même des épaules, comme\r\nsi ces mouvements, purement symboliques, pouvaient rectifier son\r\ntrajet? Des mouvements non moins significatifs se produisent quand la\r\nbille manque d’une impulsion suffisante. Et cliez les joueurs novices,\r\nils sont quelquefois accusés au point d’éveiller le sourire sur les\r\nlèvres des spectateurs.” Such movements, as it appeirs to me, may be\r\nattributed simply to habit. As often as a man has wished to move an\r\nobject to one side, he has always pushed it to that side when forwards,\r\nhe has pushed it forwards; and if he has wished to arrest it, he has\r\npulled backwards. Therefore, when a man sees his ball travelling in a\r\nwrong direction, and he intensely wishes it to go in another direction,\r\nhe cannot avoid, from long habit, unconsciously performing movements\r\nwhich in other cases he has found effectual.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of sympathetic movements Gratiolet gives (p. 212) the\r\nfollowing case:—“un jeune chien à oreilles droites, auquel son maître\r\nprésente de loin quelque viande appétissante, fixe avec ardeur ses yeux\r\nsur cet objet dont il suit tous les mouvements, et pendant que les yeux\r\nregardent, les deux oreilles se portent en avant comme si cet objet\r\npouvait être entendu.” Here, instead of speaking of sympathy between\r\nthe ears and eyes, it appears to me more simple to believe, that as\r\ndogs during many generations have, whilst intently looking at any\r\nobject, pricked their ears in order to perceive any sound; and\r\nconversely have looked intently in the direction of a sound to which\r\nthey may have listened, the movements of these organs have become\r\nfirmly associated together through long-continued habit.\r\n\r\nDr. Piderit published in 1859 an essay on Expression, which I have not\r\nseen, but in which, as he states, he forestalled Gratiolet in many of\r\nhis views. In 1867 he published his ‘Wissenschaftliches System der\r\nMimik und Physiognomik.’ It is hardly possible to give in a few\r\nsentences a fair notion of his views; perhaps the two following\r\nsentences will tell as much as can be briefly told: “the muscular\r\nmovements of expression are in part related to imaginary objects, and\r\nin part to imaginary sensorial impressions. In this proposition lies\r\nthe key to the comprehension of all expressive muscular movements.” (s.\r\n25) Again, “Expressive movements manifest themselves chiefly in the\r\nnumerous and mobile muscles of the face, partly because the nerves by\r\nwhich they are set into motion originate in the most immediate vicinity\r\nof the mind-organ, but partly also because these muscles serve to\r\nsupport the organs of sense.” (s. 26.) If Dr. Piderit had studied Sir\r\nC. Bell’s work, he would probably not have said (s. 101) that violent\r\nlaughter causes a frown from partaking of the nature of pain; or that\r\nwith infants (s. 103) the tears irritate the eyes, and thus excite the\r\ncontraction of the surrounding in muscles. Many good remarks are\r\nscattered throughout this volume, to which I shall hereafter refer.\r\n\r\nShort discussions on Expression may be found in various works, which\r\nneed not here be particularised. Mr. Bain, however, in two of his works\r\nhas treated the subject at some length. He says,[8] “I look upon the\r\nexpression so-called as part and parcel of the feeling. I believe it to\r\nbe a general law of the mind that along with the fact of inward feeling\r\nor consciousness, there is a diffusive action or excitement over the\r\nbodily members.” In another place he adds, “A very considerable number\r\nof the facts may be brought under the following principle: namely, that\r\nstates of pleasure are connected with an increase, and states of pain\r\nwith an abatement, of some, or all, of the vital functions.” But the\r\nabove law of the diffusive action of feelings seems too general to\r\nthrow much light on special expressions.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer, in treating of the Feelings in his ‘Principles of\r\nPsychology’ (1855), makes the following remarks:—“Fear, when strong,\r\nexpresses itself in cries, in efforts to hide or escape, in\r\npalpitations and tremblings; and these are just the manifestations that\r\nwould accompany an actual experience of the evil feared. The\r\ndestructive passions are shown in a general tension of the muscular\r\nsystem, in gnashing of the teeth and protrusion of the claws, in\r\ndilated eyes and nostrils in growls; and these are weaker forms of the\r\nactions that accompany the killing of prey.” Here we have, as I\r\nbelieve, the true theory of a large number of expressions; but the\r\nchief interest and difficulty of the subject lies in following out the\r\nwonderfully complex results. I infer that some one (but who he is I\r\nhave not been able to ascertain) formerly advanced a nearly similar\r\nview, for Sir C. Bell says,[9] “It has been maintained that what are\r\ncalled the external signs of passion, are only the concomitants of\r\nthose voluntary movements which the structure renders necessary.” Mr.\r\nSpencer has also published[10] a valuable essay on the physiology of\r\nLaughter, in which he insists on “the general law that feeling passing\r\na certain pitch, habitually vents itself in bodily action,” and that\r\n“an overflow of nerve-force undirected by any motive, will manifestly\r\ntake first the most habitual routes; and if these do not suffice, will\r\nnext overflow into the less habitual ones.” This law I believe to be of\r\nthe highest importance in throwing light on our subject.’[11]\r\n\r\nAll the authors who have written on Expression, with the exception of\r\nMr. Spencer—the great expounder of the principle of Evolution—appear to\r\nhave been firmly convinced that species, man of course included, came\r\ninto existence in their present condition. Sir C. Bell, being thus\r\nconvinced, maintains that many of our facial muscles are “purely\r\ninstrumental in expression;” or are “a special provision” for this sole\r\nobject.[12] But the simple fact that the anthropoid apes possess the\r\nsame facial muscles as we do,[13] renders it very improbable that these\r\nmuscles in our case serve exclusively for expression; for no one, I\r\npresume, would be inclined to admit that monkeys have been endowed with\r\nspecial muscles solely for exhibiting their hideous grimaces. Distinct\r\nuses, independently of expression, can indeed be assigned with much\r\nprobability for almost all the facial muscles.\r\n\r\nSir C. Bell evidently wished to draw as broad a distinction as possible\r\nbetween man and the lower animals; and he consequently asserts that\r\nwith “the lower creatures there is no expression but what may be\r\nreferred, more or less plainly, to their acts of volition or necessary\r\ninstincts.” He further maintains that their faces “seem chiefly capable\r\nof expressing rage and fear.”[14] But man himself cannot express love\r\nand humility by external signs, so plainly as does a dog, when with\r\ndrooping ears, hanging lips, flexuous body, and wagging tail, he meets\r\nhis beloved master. Nor can these movements in the dog be explained by\r\nacts of volition or necessary instincts, any more than the beaming eyes\r\nand smiling cheeks of a man when he meets an old friend. If Sir C. Bell\r\nhad been questioned about the expression of affection in the dog, he\r\nwould no doubt have answered that this animal had been created with\r\nspecial instincts, adapting him for association with man, and that all\r\nfurther enquiry on the subject was superfluous.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gratiolet emphatically denies[15] that any muscle has been\r\ndeveloped solely for the sake of expression, he seems never to have\r\nreflected on the principle of evolution. He apparently looks at each\r\nspecies as a separate creation. So it is with the other writers on\r\nExpression. For instance, Dr. Duchenne, after speaking of the movements\r\nof the limbs, refers to those which give expression to the face, and\r\nremarks:[16] “Le créateur n’a donc pas eu à se préoccuper ici des\r\nbesoins de la mécanique; il a pu, selon sa sagesse, ou—que l’on me\r\npardonne cette manière de parler—par une divine fantaisie, mettre en\r\naction tel ou tel muscle, un seul ou plusieurs muscles à la fois,\r\nlorsqu’il a voulu que les signes caractéristiques des passions, même\r\nles plus fugaces, fussent écrits passagèrement sur la face de l’homme.\r\nCe langage de la physionomie une fois créé, il lui a suffi, pour le\r\nrendre universel et immuable, de donner à tout être humain la faculté\r\ninstinctive d’exprimer toujours ses sendments par la contraction des\r\nmêmes muscles.”\r\n\r\nMany writers consider the whole subject of Expression as inexplicable.\r\nThus the illustrious physiologist Müller, says,[17] “The completely\r\ndifferent expression of the features in different passions shows that,\r\naccording to the kind of feeling excited, entirely different groups of\r\nthe fibres of the facial nerve are acted on. Of the cause of this we\r\nare quite ignorant.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt as long as man and all other animals are viewed as independent\r\ncreations, an effectual stop is put to our natural desire to\r\ninvestigate as far as possible the causes of Expression. By this\r\ndoctrine, anything and everything can be equally well explained; and it\r\nhas proved as pernicious with respect to Expression as to every other\r\nbranch of natural history. With mankind some expressions, such as the\r\nbristling of the hair under the influence of extreme terror, or the\r\nuncovering of the teeth under that of furious rage, can hardly be\r\nunderstood, except on the belief that man once existed in a much lower\r\nand animal-like condition. The community of certain expressions in\r\ndistinct though allied species, as in the movements of the same facial\r\nmuscles during laughter by man and by various monkeys, is rendered\r\nsomewhat more intelligible, if we believe in their descent from a\r\ncommon progenitor. He who admits on general grounds that the structure\r\nand habits of all animals have been gradually evolved, will look at the\r\nwhole subject of Expression in a new and interesting light.\r\n\r\nThe study of Expression is difficult, owing to the movements being\r\noften extremely slight, and of a fleeting nature. A difference may be\r\nclearly perceived, and yet it may be impossible, at least I have found\r\nit so, to state in what the difference consists. When we witness any\r\ndeep emotion, our sympathy is so strongly excited, that close\r\nobservation is forgotten or rendered almost impossible; of which fact I\r\nhave had many curious proofs. Our imagination is another and still more\r\nserious source of error; for if from the nature of the circumstances we\r\nexpect to see any expression, we readily imagine its presence.\r\nNotwithstanding Dr. Duchenne’s great experience, he for a long time\r\nfancied, as he states, that several muscles contracted under certain\r\nemotions, whereas he ultimately convinced himself that the movement was\r\nconfined to a single muscle.\r\n\r\nIn order to acquire as good a foundation as possible, and to ascertain,\r\nindependently of common opinion, how far particular movements of the\r\nfeatures and gestures are really expressive of certain states of the\r\nmind, I have found the following means the most serviceable. In the\r\nfirst place, to observe infants; for they exhibit many emotions, as Sir\r\nC. Bell remarks, “with extraordinary force;” whereas, in after life,\r\nsome of our expressions “cease to have the pure and simple source from\r\nwhich they spring in infancy.”[18]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it occurred to me that the insane ought to be\r\nstudied, as they are liable to the strongest passions, and give\r\nuncontrolled vent to them. I had, myself, no opportunity of doing this,\r\nso I applied to Dr. Maudsley and received from him an introduction to\r\nDr. J. Crichton Browne, who has charge of an immense asylum near\r\nWakefield, and who, as I found, had already attended to the subject.\r\nThis excellent observer has with unwearied kindness sent me copious\r\nnotes and descriptions, with valuable suggestions on many points; and I\r\ncan hardly over-estimate the value of his assistance. I owe also, to\r\nthe kindness of Mr. Patrick Nicol, of the Sussex Lunatic Asylum,\r\ninteresting statements on two or three points.\r\n\r\nThirdly Dr. Duchenne galvanized, as we have already seen, certain\r\nmuscles in the face of an old man, whose skin was little sensitive, and\r\nthus produced various expressions which were photographed on a large\r\nscale. It fortunately occurred to me to show several of the best\r\nplates, without a word of explanation, to above twenty educated persons\r\nof various ages and both sexes, asking them, in each case, by what\r\nemotion or feeling the old man was supposed to be agitated; and I\r\nrecorded their answers in the words which they used. Several of the\r\nexpressions were instantly recognised by almost everyone, though\r\ndescribed in not exactly the same terms; and these may, I think, be\r\nrelied on as truthful, and will hereafter be specified. On the other\r\nhand, the most widely different judgments were pronounced in regard to\r\nsome of them. This exhibition was of use in another way, by convincing\r\nme how easily we may be misguided by our imagination; for when I first\r\nlooked through Dr. Duchenne’s photographs, reading at the same time the\r\ntext, and thus learning what was intended, I was struck with admiration\r\nat the truthfulness of all, with only a few exceptions. Nevertheless,\r\nif I had examined them without any explanation, no doubt I should have\r\nbeen as much perplexed, in some cases, as other persons have been.\r\n\r\nFourthly, I had hoped to derive much aid from the great masters in\r\npainting and sculpture, who are such close observers. Accordingly, I\r\nhave looked at photographs and engravings of many well-known works;\r\nbut, with a few exceptions, have not thus profited. The reason no doubt\r\nis, that in works of art, beauty is the chief object; and strongly\r\ncontracted facial muscles destroy beauty.[19] The story of the\r\ncomposition is generally told with wonderful force and truth by\r\nskilfully given accessories.\r\n\r\nFifthly, it seemed to me highly important to ascertain whether the same\r\nexpressions and gestures prevail, as has often been asserted without\r\nmuch evidence, with all the races of mankind, especially with those who\r\nhave associated but little with Europeans. Whenever the same movements\r\nof the features or body express the same emotions in several distinct\r\nraces of man, we may infer with much probability, that such expressions\r\nare true ones,—that is, are innate or instinctive. Conventional\r\nexpressions or gestures, acquired by the individual during early life,\r\nwould probably have differed in the different races, in the same manner\r\nas do their languages. Accordingly I circulated, early in the year\r\n1867, the following printed queries with a request, which has been\r\nfully responded to, that actual observations, and not memory, might be\r\ntrusted. These queries were written after a considerable interval of\r\ntime, during which my attention had been otherwise directed, and I can\r\nnow see that they might have been greatly improved. To some of the\r\nlater copies, I appended, in manuscript, a few additional remarks:—\r\n\r\n(1.) Is astonishment expressed by the eyes and mouth being opened wide,\r\nand by the eyebrows being raised?\r\n\r\n(2.) Does shame excite a blush when the colour of the skin allows it to\r\nbe visible? and especially how low down the body does the blush extend?\r\n\r\n(3.) When a man is indignant or defiant does he frown, hold his body\r\nand head erect, square his shoulders and clench his fists?\r\n\r\n(4) When considering deeply on any subject, or trying to understand any\r\npuzzle, does he frown, or wrinkle the skin beneath the lower eyelids?\r\n\r\n(5.) When in low spirits, are the corners of the mouth depressed, and\r\nthe inner corner of the eyebrows raised by that muscle which the French\r\ncall the “Grief muscle”? The eyebrow in this state becomes slightly\r\noblique, with a little swelling at the Inner end; and the forehead is\r\ntransversely wrinkled in the middle part, but not across the whole\r\nbreadth, as when the eyebrows are raised in surprise.\r\n\r\n(6.) When in good spirits do the eyes sparkle, with the skin a little\r\nwrinkled round and under them, and with the mouth a little drawn back\r\nat the corners?\r\n\r\n(7.) When a man sneers or snarls at another, is the corner of the upper\r\nlip over the canine or eye tooth raised on the side facing the man whom\r\nhe addresses?\r\n\r\n(8) Can a dogged or obstinate expression be recognized, which is\r\nchiefly shown by the mouth being firmly closed, a lowering brow and a\r\nslight frown?\r\n\r\n(9.) Is contempt expressed by a slight protrusion of the lips and by\r\nturning up the nose, and with a slight expiration?\r\n\r\n(10) Is disgust shown by the lower lip being turned down, the upper lip\r\nslightly raised, with a sudden expiration, something like incipient\r\nvomiting, or like something spit out of the mouth?\r\n\r\n(11.) Is extreme fear expressed in the same general manner as with\r\nEuropeans?\r\n\r\n(12.) Is laughter ever carried to such an extreme as to bring tears\r\ninto the eyes?\r\n\r\n(13.) When a man wishes to show that he cannot prevent something being\r\ndone, or cannot himself do something, does he shrug his shoulders, turn\r\ninwards his elbows, extend outwards his hands and open the palms; with\r\nthe eyebrows raised?\r\n\r\n(14) Do the children when sulky, pout or greatly protrude the lips?\r\n\r\n(15.) Can guilty, or sly, or jealous expressions be recognized? though\r\nI know not how these can be defined.\r\n\r\n(16.) Is the head nodded vertically in affirmation, and shaken\r\nlaterally in negation?\r\n\r\nObservations on natives who have had little communication with\r\nEuropeans would be of course the most valuable, though those made on\r\nany natives would be of much interest to me. General remarks on\r\nexpression are of comparatively little value; and memory is so\r\ndeceptive that I earnestly beg it may not be trusted. A definite\r\ndescription of the countenance under any emotion or frame of mind, with\r\na statement of the circumstances under which it occurred, would possess\r\nmuch value.\r\n\r\nTo these queries I have received thirty-six answers from different\r\nobservers, several of them missionaries or protectors of the\r\naborigines, to all of whom I am deeply indebted for the great trouble\r\nwhich they have taken, and for the valuable aid thus received. I will\r\nspecify their names, &c., towards the close of this chapter, so as not\r\nto interrupt my present remarks. The answers relate to several of the\r\nmost distinct and savage races of man. In many instances, the\r\ncircumstances have been recorded under which each expression was\r\nobserved, and the expression itself described. In such cases, much\r\nconfidence may be placed in the answers. When the answers have been\r\nsimply yes or no, I have always received them with caution. It follows,\r\nfrom the information thus acquired, that the same state of mind is\r\nexpressed throughout the world with remarkable uniformity; and this\r\nfact is in itself interesting as evidence of the close similarity in\r\nbodily structure and mental disposition of all the races, of mankind.\r\n\r\nSixthly, and lastly, I have attended as closely as I could, to the\r\nexpression of the several passions in some of the commoner animals; and\r\nthis I believe to be of paramount importance, not of course for\r\ndeciding how far in man certain expressions are characteristic of\r\ncertain states of mind, but as affording the safest basis for\r\ngeneralisation on the causes, or origin, of the various movements of\r\nExpression. In observing animals, we are not so likely to be biassed by\r\nour imagination; and we may feel safe that their expressions are not\r\nconventional.\r\n\r\nFrom the reasons above assigned, namely, the fleeting nature of some\r\nexpressions (the changes in the features being often extremely slight);\r\nour sympathy being easily aroused when we behold any strong emotion,\r\nand our attention thus distracted; our imagination deceiving us, from\r\nknowing in a vague manner what to expect, though certainly few of us\r\nknow what the exact changes in the countenance are; and lastly, even\r\nour long familiarity with the subject,—from all these causes combined,\r\nthe observation of Expression is by no means easy, as many persons,\r\nwhom I have asked to observe certain points, have soon discovered.\r\nHence it is difficult to determine, with certainty, what are the\r\nmovements of the features and of the body, which commonly characterize\r\ncertain states of the mind. Nevertheless, some of the doubts and\r\ndifficulties have, as I hope, been cleared away by the observation of\r\ninfants,—of the insane,—of the different races of man,—of works of\r\nart,—and lastly, of the facial muscles under the action of galvanism,\r\nas effected by Dr. Duchenne.\r\n\r\nBut there remains the much greater difficulty of understanding the\r\ncause or origin of the several expressions, and of judging whether any\r\ntheoretical explanation is trustworthy. Besides, judging as well as we\r\ncan by our reason, without the aid of any rules, which of two or more\r\nexplanations is the most satisfactory, or are quite unsatisfactory, I\r\nsee only one way of testing our conclusions. This is to observe whether\r\nthe same principle by which one expression can, as it appears, be\r\nexplained, is applicable in other allied cases; and especially, whether\r\nthe same general principles can be applied with satisfactory results,\r\nboth to man and the lower animals. This latter method, I am inclined to\r\nthink, is the most serviceable of all. The difficulty of judging of the\r\ntruth of any theoretical explanation, and of testing it by some\r\ndistinct line of investigation, is the great drawback to that interest\r\nwhich the study seems well fitted to excite.\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to my own observations, I may state that they\r\nwere commenced in the year 1838; and from that time to the present day,\r\nI have occasionally attended to the subject. At the above date, I was\r\nalready inclined to believe in the principle of evolution, or of the\r\nderivation of species from other and lower forms. Consequently, when I\r\nread Sir C. Bell’s great work, his view, that man had been created with\r\ncertain muscles specially adapted for the expression of his feelings,\r\nstruck me as unsatisfactory. It seemed probable that the habit of\r\nexpressing our feelings by certain movements, though now rendered\r\ninnate, had been in some manner gradually acquired. But to discover how\r\nsuch habits had been acquired was perplexing in no small degree. The\r\nwhole subject had to be viewed under a new aspect, and each expression\r\ndemanded a rational explanation. This belief led me to attempt the\r\npresent work, however imperfectly it may have been executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now give the names of the gentlemen to whom, as I have said, I\r\nam deeply indebted for information in regard to the expressions\r\nexhibited by various races of man, and I will specify some of the\r\ncircumstances under which the observations were in each case made.\r\nOwing to the great kindness and powerful influence of Mr. Wilson, of\r\nHayes Place, Kent, I have received from Australia no less than thirteen\r\nsets of answers to my queries. This has been particularly fortunate, as\r\nthe Australian aborigines rank amongst the most distinct of all the\r\nraces of man. It will be seen that the observations have been chiefly\r\nmade in the south, in the outlying parts of the colony of Victoria; but\r\nsome excellent answers have been received from the north.\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson Lacy has given me in detail some valuable observations, made\r\nseveral hundred miles in the interior of Queensland. To Mr. R. Brough\r\nSmyth, of Melbourne, I am much indebted for observations made by\r\nhimself, and for sending me several of the following letters,\r\nnamely:—From the Rev. Mr. Hagenauer, of Lake Wellington, a missionary\r\nin Gippsland, Victoria, who has had much experience with the natives.\r\nFrom Mr. Samuel Wilson, a landowner, residing at Langerenong, Wimmera,\r\nVictoria. From the Rev. George Taplin, superintendent of the native\r\nIndustrial Settlement at Port Macleay. From Mr. Archibald G. Lang, of\r\nCoranderik, Victoria, a teacher at a school where aborigines, old and\r\nyoung, are collected from all parts of the colony. From Mr. H. B. Lane,\r\nof Belfast, Victoria, a police magistrate and warden, whose\r\nobservations, as I am assured, are highly trustworthy. From Mr.\r\nTempleton Bunnett, of Echuca, whose station is on the borders of the\r\ncolony of Victoria, and who has thus been able to observe many\r\naborigines who have had little intercourse with white men. He compared\r\nhis observations with those made by two other gentlemen long resident\r\nin the neighbourhood. Also from Mr. J. Bulmer, a missionary in a remote\r\npart of Gippsland, Victoria.\r\n\r\nI am also indebted to the distinguished botanist, Dr. Ferdinand Müller,\r\nof Victoria, for some observations made by himself, and for sending me\r\nothers made by Mrs. Green, as well as for some of the foregoing\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Maoris of New Zealand, the Rev. J. W. Stack has\r\nanswered only a few of my queries; but the answers have been remarkably\r\nfull, clear, and distinct, with the circumstances recorded under which\r\nthe observations were made.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah Brooke has given me some information with respect to the\r\nDyaks of Borneo.\r\n\r\nRespecting the Malays, I have been highly successful; for Mr. F. Geach\r\n(to whom I was introduced by Mr. Wallace), during his residence as a\r\nmining engineer in the interior of Malacca, observed many natives, who\r\nhad never before associated with white men. He wrote me two long\r\nletters with admirable and detailed observations on their expression.\r\nHe likewise observed the Chinese immigrants in the Malay archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe well-known naturalist, H. M. Consul, Mr. Swinhoe, also observed for\r\nme the Chinese in their native country; and he made inquiries from\r\nothers whom he could trust.\r\n\r\nIn India Mr. H. Erskine, whilst residing in his official capacity in\r\nthe Admednugur District in the Bombay Presidency, attended to the\r\nexpression of the inhabitants, but found much difficulty in arriving at\r\nany safe conclusions, owing to their habitual concealment of all\r\nemotions in the presence of Europeans. He also obtained information for\r\nme from Mr. West, the Judge in Canara, and he consulted some\r\nintelligent native gentlemen on certain points. In Calcutta Mr. J.\r\nScott, curator of the Botanic Gardens, carefully observed the various\r\ntribes of men therein employed during a considerable period, and no one\r\nhas sent me such full and valuable details. The habit of accurate\r\nobservation, gained by his botanical studies, has been brought to bear\r\non our present subject. For Ceylon I am much indebted to the Rev. S. O.\r\nGlenie for answers to some of my queries.\r\n\r\nTurning to Africa, I have been unfortunate with respect to the negroes,\r\nthough Mr. Winwood Reade aided me as far as lay in his power. It would\r\nhave been comparatively easy to have obtained information in regard to\r\nthe negro slaves in America; but as they have long associated with\r\nwhite men, such observations would have possessed little value. In the\r\nsouthern parts of the continent Mrs. Barber observed the Kafirs and\r\nFingoes, and sent me many distinct answers. Mr. J. P. Mansel Weale also\r\nmade some observations on the natives, and procured for me a curious\r\ndocument, namely, the opinion, written in English, of Christian Gaika,\r\nbrother of the Chief Sandilli, on the expressions of his\r\nfellow-countrymen. In the northern regions of Africa Captain Speedy,\r\nwho long resided with the Abyssinians, answered my queries partly from\r\nmemory and partly from observations made on the son of King Theodore,\r\nwho was then under his charge. Professor and Mrs. Asa Gray attended to\r\nsome points in the expressions of the natives, as observed by them\r\nwhilst ascending the Nile.\r\n\r\nOn the great American continent Mr. Bridges, a catechist residing with\r\nthe Fuegians, answered some few questions about their expression,\r\naddressed to him many years ago. In the northern half of the continent\r\nDr. Rothrock attended to the expressions of the wild Atnah and Espyox\r\ntribes on the Nasse River, in North-Western America. Mr. Washington\r\nMatthews Assistant-Surgeon in the United States Army, also observed\r\nwith special care (after having seen my queries, as printed in the\r\n‘Smithsonian Report’) some of the wildest tribes in the Western parts\r\nof the United States, namely, the Tetons, Grosventres, Mandans, and\r\nAssinaboines; and his answers have proved of the highest value.\r\n\r\nLastly, besides these special sources of information, I have collected\r\nsome few facts incidentally given in books of travels.——\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscles of the Human Face. Fig 1-2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscles of the Human Face. Fig 3\r\n\r\nAs I shall often have to refer, more especially in the latter part of\r\nthis volume, to the muscles of the human face, I have had a diagram\r\n(fig. 1) copied and reduced from Sir C. Bell’s work, and two others,\r\nwith more accurate details (figs. 2 and 3), from Herde’s well-known\r\n‘Handbuch der Systematischen Anatomie des Menschen.’ The same letters\r\nrefer to the same muscles in all three figures, but the names are given\r\nof only the more important ones to which I shall have to allude. The\r\nfacial muscles blend much together, and, as I am informed, hardly\r\nappear on a dissected face so distinct as they are here represented.\r\nSome writers consider that these muscles consist of nineteen pairs,\r\nwith one unpaired;[20] but others make the number much larger,\r\namounting even to fifty-five, according to Moreau. They are, as is\r\nadmitted by everyone who has written on the subject, very variable in\r\nstructure; and Moreau remarks that they are hardly alike in\r\nhalf-a-dozen subjects.[21] They are also variable in function. Thus the\r\npower of uncovering the canine tooth on one side differs much in\r\ndifferent persons. The power of raising the wings of the nostrils is\r\nalso, according to Dr. Piderit,[22] variable in a remarkable degree;\r\nand other such cases could be given.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must have the pleasure of expressing my obligations to Mr.\r\nRejlander for the trouble which he has taken in photographing for me\r\nvarious expressions and gestures. I am also indebted to Herr\r\nKindermann, of Hamburg, for the loan of some excellent negatives of\r\ncrying infants; and to Dr. Wallich for a charming one of a smiling\r\ngirl. I have already expressed my obligations to Dr. Duchenne for\r\ngenerously permitting me to have some of his large photographs copied\r\nand reduced. All these photographs have been printed by the Heliotype\r\nprocess, and the accuracy of the copy is thus guaranteed. These plates\r\nare referred to by Roman numerals.\r\n\r\nI am also greatly indebted to Mr. T. W. Wood for the extreme pains\r\nwhich he has taken in drawing from life the expressions of various\r\nanimals. A distinguished artist, Mr. Riviere, has had the kindness to\r\ngive me two drawings of dogs—one in a hostile and the other in a humble\r\nand caressing frame of mind. Mr. A. May has also given me two similar\r\nsketches of dogs. Mr. Cooper has taken much care in cutting the blocks.\r\nSome of the photographs and drawings, namely, those by Mr. May, and\r\nthose by Mr. Wolf of the Cynopithecus, were first reproduced by Mr.\r\nCooper on wood by means of photography, and then engraved: by this\r\nmeans almost complete fidelity is ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EXPRESSION.\r\n\r\nThe three chief principles stated—The first principle—Serviceable\r\nactions become habitual in association with certain states of the mind,\r\nand are performed whether or not of service in each particular case—The\r\nforce of habit—Inheritance—Associated habitual movements in man—Reflex\r\nactions—Passage of habits into reflex actions—Associated habitual\r\nmovements in the lower animals—Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\nI will begin by giving the three Principles, which appear to me to\r\naccount for most of the expressions and gestures involuntarily used by\r\nman and the lower animals, under the influence of various emotions and\r\nsensations.[101] I arrived, however, at these three Principles only at\r\nthe close of my observations. They will be discussed in the present and\r\ntwo following chapters in a general manner. Facts observed both with\r\nman and the lower animals will here be made use of; but the latter\r\nfacts are preferable, as less likely to deceive us. In the fourth and\r\nfifth chapters, I will describe the special expressions of some of the\r\nlower animals; and in the succeeding chapters those of man. Everyone\r\nwill thus be able to judge for himself, how far my three principles\r\nthrow light on the theory of the subject. It appears to me that so many\r\nexpressions are thus explained in a fairly satisfactory manner, that\r\nprobably all will hereafter be found to come under the same or closely\r\nanalogous heads. I need hardly premise that movements or changes in any\r\npart of the body,—as the wagging of a dog’s tail, the drawing back of a\r\nhorse’s ears, the shrugging of a man’s shoulders, or the dilatation of\r\nthe capillary vessels of the skin,—may all equally well serve for\r\nexpression. The three Principles are as follows.\r\n\r\nI. _The principle of serviceable associated Habits_.—Certain complex\r\nactions are of direct or indirect service under certain states of the\r\nmind, in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations, desires, &c.;\r\nand whenever the same state of mind is induced, however feebly, there\r\nis a tendency through the force of habit and association for the same\r\nmovements to be performed, though they may not then be of the least\r\nuse. Some actions ordinarily associated through habit with certain\r\nstates of the mind may be partially repressed through the will, and in\r\nsuch cases the muscles which are least under the separate control of\r\nthe will are the most liable still to act, causing movements which we\r\nrecognize as expressive. In certain other cases the checking of one\r\nhabitual movement requires other slight movements; and these are\r\nlikewise expressive.\r\n\r\nII. _The principle of Antithesis_.—Certain states of the mind lead to\r\ncertain habitual actions, which are of service, as under our first\r\nprinciple. Now when a directly opposite state of mind is induced, there\r\nis a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements of\r\na directly opposite nature, though these are of no use; and such\r\nmovements are in some cases highly expressive.\r\n\r\nIII. _The principle of actions due to the constitution of the Nervous\r\nSystem, independently from the first of the Will, and independently to\r\na certain extent of Habit_.—When the sensorium is strongly excited,\r\nnerve-force is generated in excess, and is transmitted in certain\r\ndefinite directions, depending on the connection of the nerve-cells,\r\nand partly on habit: or the supply of nerve-force may, as it appears,\r\nbe interrupted. Effects are thus produced which we recognize as\r\nexpressive. This third principle may, for the sake of brevity, be\r\ncalled that of the direct action of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our _first Principle_, it is notorious how powerful is\r\nthe force of habit. The most complex and difficult movements can in\r\ntime be performed without the least effort or consciousness. It is not\r\npositively known how it comes that habit is so efficient in\r\nfacilitating complex movements; but physiologists admit[102] “that the\r\nconducting power of the nervous fibres increases with the frequency of\r\ntheir excitement.” This applies to the nerves of motion and sensation,\r\nas well as to those connected with the act of thinking. That some\r\nphysical change is produced in the nerve-cells or nerves which are\r\nhabitually used can hardly be doubted, for otherwise it is impossible\r\nto understand how the tendency to certain acquired movements is\r\ninherited. That they are inherited we see with horses in certain\r\ntransmitted paces, such as cantering and ambling, which are not natural\r\nto them,—in the pointing of young pointers and the setting of young\r\nsetters—in the peculiar manner of flight of certain breeds of the\r\npigeon, &c. We have analogous cases with mankind in the inheritance of\r\ntricks or unusual gestures, to which we shall presently recur. To those\r\nwho admit the gradual evolution of species, a most striking instance of\r\nthe perfection with which the most difficult consensual movements can\r\nbe transmitted, is afforded by the humming-bird Sphinx-moth\r\n(_Macroglossa_); for this moth, shortly after its emergence from the\r\ncocoon, as shown by the bloom on its unruffled scales, may be seen\r\npoised stationary in the air, with its long hair-like proboscis\r\nuncurled and inserted into the minute orifices of flowers; and no one,\r\nI believe, has ever seen this moth learning to perform its difficult\r\ntask, which requires such unerring aim.\r\n\r\nWhen there exists an inherited or instinctive tendency to the\r\nperformance of an action, or an inherited taste for certain kinds of\r\nfood, some degree of habit in the individual is often or generally\r\nrequisite. We find this in the paces of the horse, and to a certain\r\nextent in the pointing of dogs; although some young dogs point\r\nexcellently the first time they are taken out, yet they often associate\r\nthe proper inherited attitude with a wrong odour, and even with\r\neyesight. I have heard it asserted that if a calf be allowed to suck\r\nits mother only once, it is much more difficult afterwards to rear it\r\nby hand.[103] Caterpillars which have been fed on the leaves of one\r\nkind of tree, have been known to perish from hunger rather than to eat\r\nthe leaves of another tree, although this afforded them their proper\r\nfood, under a state of nature;[104] and so it is in many other cases.\r\n\r\nThe power of Association is admitted by everyone. Mr. Bain remarks,\r\nthat “actions, sensations and states of feeling, occurring together or\r\nin close succession, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way\r\nthat when any one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the\r\nothers are apt to be brought up in idea.”[105] It is so important for\r\nour purpose fully to recognize that actions readily become associated\r\nwith other actions and with various states of the mind, that I will\r\ngive a good many instances, in the first place relating to man, and\r\nafterwards to the lower animals. Some of the instances are of a very\r\ntrifling nature, but they are as good for our purpose as more important\r\nhabits. It is known to everyone how difficult, or even impossible it\r\nis, without repeated trials, to move the limbs in certain opposed\r\ndirections which have never been practised. Analogous cases occur with\r\nsensations, as in the common experiment of rolling a marble beneath the\r\ntips of two crossed fingers, when it feels exactly like two marbles.\r\nEveryone protects himself when falling to the ground by extending his\r\narms, and as Professor Alison has remarked, few can resist acting thus,\r\nwhen voluntarily falling on a soft bed. A man when going out of doors\r\nputs on his gloves quite unconsciously; and this may seem an extremely\r\nsimple operation, but he who has taught a child to put on gloves, knows\r\nthat this is by no means the case.\r\n\r\nWhen our minds are much affected, so are the movements of our bodies;\r\nbut here another principle besides habit, namely the undirected\r\noverflow of nerve-force, partially comes into play. Norfolk, in\r\nspeaking of Cardinal Wolsey, says—\r\n\r\n“Some strange commotion\r\nIs in his brain; he bites his lip and starts;\r\nStops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,\r\nThen, lays his finger on his temple: straight,\r\nSprings out into fast gait; then, stops again,\r\nStrikes his breast hard; and anon, he casts\r\nHis eye against the moon: in most strange postures\r\nWe have seen him set himself.”—_Hen. VIII_., act iii, sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vulgar man often scratches his head when perplexed in mind; and I\r\nbelieve that he acts thus from habit, as if he experienced a slightly\r\nuncomfortable bodily sensation, namely, the itching of his head, to\r\nwhich he is particularly liable, and which he thus relieves. Another\r\nman rubs his eyes when perplexed, or gives a little cough when\r\nembarrassed, acting in either case as if he felt a slightly\r\nuncomfortable sensation in his eyes or windpipe.[106]\r\n\r\nFrom the continued use of the eyes, these organs are especially liable\r\nto be acted on through association under various states of the mind,\r\nalthough there is manifestly nothing to be seen. A man, as Gratiolet\r\nremarks, who vehemently rejects a proposition, will almost certainly\r\nshut his eyes or turn away his face; but if he accepts the proposition,\r\nhe will nod his head in affirmation and open his eyes widely. The man\r\nacts in this latter case as if he clearly saw the thing, and in the\r\nformer case as if he did not or would not see it. I have noticed that\r\npersons in describing a horrid sight often shut their eyes momentarily\r\nand firmly, or shake their heads, as if not to see or to drive away\r\nsomething disagreeable; and I have caught myself, when thinking in the\r\ndark of a horrid spectacle, closing my eyes firmly. In looking suddenly\r\nat any object, or in looking all around, everyone raises his eyebrows,\r\nso that the eyes may be quickly and widely opened; and Duchenne remarks\r\nthat[107] a person in trying to remember something often raises his\r\neyebrows, as if to see it. A Hindoo gentleman made exactly the same\r\nremark to Mr. Erskine in regard to his countrymen. I noticed a young\r\nlady earnestly trying to recollect a painter’s name, and she first\r\nlooked to one corner of the ceiling and then to the opposite corner,\r\narching the one eyebrow on that side; although, of course, there was\r\nnothing to be seen there.\r\n\r\nIn most of the foregoing cases, we can understand how the associated\r\nmovements were acquired through habit; but with some individuals,\r\ncertain strange gestures or tricks have arisen in association with\r\ncertain states of the mind, owing to wholly inexplicable causes, and\r\nare undoubtedly inherited. I have elsewhere given one instance from my\r\nown observation of an extraordinary and complex gesture, associated\r\nwith pleasurable feelings, which was transmitted from a father to his\r\ndaughter, as well as some other analogous facts.[108] Another curious\r\ninstance of an odd inherited movement, associated with the wish to\r\nobtain an object, will be given in the course of this volume.\r\n\r\nThere are other actions which are commonly performed under certain\r\ncircumstances, independently of habit, and which seem to be due to\r\nimitation or some sort of sympathy. Thus persons cutting anything with\r\na pair of scissors may be seen to move their jaws simultaneously with\r\nthe blades of the scissors. Children learning to write often twist\r\nabout their tongues as their fingers move, in a ridiculous fashion.\r\nWhen a public singer suddenly becomes a little hoarse, many of those\r\npresent may be heard, as I have been assured by a gentleman on whom I\r\ncan rely, to clear their throats; but here habit probably comes into\r\nplay, as we clear our own throats under similar circumstances. I have\r\nalso been told that at leaping matches, as the performer makes his\r\nspring, many of the spectators, generally men and boys, move their\r\nfeet; but here again habit probably comes into play, for it is very\r\ndoubtful whether women would thus act.\r\n\r\n_Reflex actions_—Reflex actions, in the strict sense of the term, are\r\ndue to the excitement of a peripheral nerve, which transmits its\r\ninfluence to certain nerve-cells, and these in their turn excite\r\ncertain muscles or glands into action; and all this may take place\r\nwithout any sensation or consciousness on our part, though often thus\r\naccompanied. As many reflex actions are highly expressive, the subject\r\nmust here be noticed at some little length. We shall also see that some\r\nof them graduate into, and can hardly be distinguished from actions\r\nwhich have arisen through habit?[109] Coughing and sneezing are\r\nfamiliar instances of reflex actions. With infants the first act of\r\nrespiration is often a sneeze, although this requires the co-ordinated\r\nmovement of numerous muscles. Respiration is partly voluntary, but\r\nmainly reflex, and is performed in the most natural and best manner\r\nwithout the interference of the will. A vast number of complex\r\nmovements are reflex. As good an instance as can be given is the\r\noften-quoted one of a decapitated frog, which cannot of course feel,\r\nand cannot consciously perform, any movement. Yet if a drop of acid be\r\nplaced on the lower surface of the thigh of a frog in this state, it\r\nwill rub off the drop with the upper surface of the foot of the same\r\nleg. If this foot be cut off, it cannot thus act. “After some fruitless\r\nefforts, therefore, it gives up trying in that way, seems restless, as\r\nthough, says Pflüger, it was seeking some other way, and at last it\r\nmakes use of the foot of the other leg and succeeds in rubbing off the\r\nacid. Notably we have here not merely contractions of muscles, but\r\ncombined and harmonized contractions in due sequence for a special\r\npurpose. These are actions that have all the appearance of being guided\r\nby intelligence and instigated by will in an animal, the recognized\r\norgan of whose intelligence and will has been removed.”[110]\r\n\r\nWe see the difference between reflex and voluntary movements in very\r\nyoung children not being able to perform, as I am informed by Sir Henry\r\nHolland, certain acts somewhat analogous to those of sneezing and\r\ncoughing, namely, in their not being able to blow their noses (_i.e._\r\nto compress the nose and blow violently through the passage), and in\r\ntheir not being able to clear their throats of phlegm. They have to\r\nlearn to perform these acts, yet they are performed by us, when a\r\nlittle older, almost as easily as reflex actions. Sneezing and\r\ncoughing, however, can be controlled by the will only partially or not\r\nat all; whilst the clearing the throat and blowing the nose are\r\ncompletely under our command.\r\n\r\nWhen we are conscious of the presence of an irritating particle in our\r\nnostrils or windpipe—that is, when the same sensory nerve-cells are\r\nexcited, as in the case of sneezing and coughing—we can voluntarily\r\nexpel the particle by forcibly driving air through these passages; but\r\nwe cannot do this with nearly the same force, rapidity, and precision,\r\nas by a reflex action. In this latter case the sensory nerve-cells\r\napparently excite the motor nerve-cells without any waste of power by\r\nfirst communicating with the cerebral hemispheres—the seat of our\r\nconsciousness and volition. In all cases there seems to exist a\r\nprofound antagonism between the same movements, as directed by the will\r\nand by a reflex stimulant, in the force with which they are performed\r\nand in the facility with which they are excited. As Claude Bernard\r\nasserts, “L’influence du cerveau tend donc à entraver les mouvements\r\nréflexes, à limiter leur force et leur étendue.”[111]\r\n\r\nThe conscious wish to perform a reflex action sometimes stops or\r\ninterrupts its performance, though the proper sensory nerves may be\r\nstimulated. For instance, many years ago I laid a small wager with a\r\ndozen young men that they would not sneeze if they took snuff, although\r\nthey all declared that they invariably did so; accordingly they all\r\ntook a pinch, but from wishing much to succeed, not one sneezed, though\r\ntheir eyes watered, and all, without exception, had to pay me the\r\nwager. Sir H. Holland remarks[112] that attention paid to the act of\r\nswallowing interferes with the proper movements; from which it probably\r\nfollows, at least in part, that some persons find it so difficult to\r\nswallow a pill.\r\n\r\nAnother familiar instance of a reflex action is the involuntary closing\r\nof the eyelids when the surface of the eye is touched. A similar\r\nwinking movement is caused when a blow is directed towards the face;\r\nbut this is an habitual and not a strictly reflex action, as the\r\nstimulus is conveyed through the mind and not by the excitement of a\r\nperipheral nerve. The whole body and head are generally at the same\r\ntime drawn suddenly backwards. These latter movements, however, can be\r\nprevented, if the danger does not appear to the imagination imminent;\r\nbut our reason telling us that there is no danger does not suffice. I\r\nmay mention a trifling fact, illustrating this point, and which at the\r\ntime amused me. I put my face close to the thick glass-plate in front\r\nof a puff-adder in the Zoological Gardens, with the firm determination\r\nof not starting back if the snake struck at me; but, as soon as the\r\nblow was struck, my resolution went for nothing, and I jumped a yard or\r\ntwo backwards with astonishing rapidity. My will and reason were\r\npowerless against the imagination of a danger which had never been\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThe violence of a start seems to depend partly on the vividness of the\r\nimagination, and partly on the condition, either habitual or temporary,\r\nof the nervous system. He who will attend to the starting of his horse,\r\nwhen tired and fresh, will perceive how perfect is the gradation from a\r\nmere glance at some unexpected object, with a momentary doubt whether\r\nit is dangerous, to a jump so rapid and violent, that the animal\r\nprobably could not voluntarily whirl round in so rapid a manner. The\r\nnervous system of a fresh and highly-fed horse sends its order to the\r\nmotory system so quickly, that no time is allowed for him to consider\r\nwhether or not the danger is real. After one violent start, when he is\r\nexcited and the blood flows freely through his brain, he is very apt to\r\nstart again; and so it is, as I have noticed, with young infants.\r\n\r\nA start from a sudden noise, when the stimulus is conveyed through the\r\nauditory nerves, is always accompanied in grown-up persons by the\r\nwinking of the eyelids.[113] I observed, however, that though my\r\ninfants started at sudden sounds, when under a fortnight old, they\r\ncertainly did not always wink their eyes, and I believe never did so.\r\nThe start of an older infant apparently represents a vague catching\r\nhold of something to prevent falling. I shook a pasteboard box close\r\nbefore the eyes of one of my infants, when 114 days old, and it did not\r\nin the least wink; but when I put a few comfits into the box, holding\r\nit in the same position as before, and rattled them, the child blinked\r\nits eyes violently every time, and started a little. It was obviously\r\nimpossible that a carefully-guarded infant could have learnt by\r\nexperience that a rattling sound near its eyes indicated danger to\r\nthem. But such experience will have been slowly gained at a later age\r\nduring a long series of generations; and from what we know of\r\ninheritance, there is nothing improbable in the transmission of a habit\r\nto the offspring at an earlier age than that at which it was first\r\nacquired by the parents.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks it seems probable that some actions, which\r\nwere at first performed consciously, have become through habit and\r\nassociation converted into reflex actions, and are now so firmly fixed\r\nand inherited, that they are performed, even when not of the least\r\nuse,[114] as often as the same causes arise, which originally excited\r\nthem in us through the volition. In such cases the sensory nerve-cells\r\nexcite the motor cells, without first communicating with those cells on\r\nwhich our consciousness and volition depend. It is probable that\r\nsneezing and coughing were originally acquired by the habit of\r\nexpelling, as violently as possible, any irritating particle from the\r\nsensitive air-passages. As far as time is concerned, there has been\r\nmore than enough for these habits to have become innate or converted\r\ninto reflex actions; for they are common to most or all of the higher\r\nquadrupeds, and must therefore have been first acquired at a very\r\nremote period. Why the act of clearing the throat is not a reflex\r\naction, and has to be learnt by our children, I cannot pretend to say;\r\nbut we can see why blowing the nose on a handkerchief has to be learnt.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely credible that the movements of a headless frog, when it\r\nwipes off a drop of acid or other object from its thigh, and which\r\nmovements are so well coordinated for a special purpose, were not at\r\nfirst performed voluntarily, being afterwards rendered easy through\r\nlong-continued habit so as at last to be performed unconsciously, or\r\nindependently of the cerebral hemispheres.\r\n\r\nSo again it appears probable that starting was originally acquired by\r\nthe habit of jumping away as quickly as possible from danger, whenever\r\nany of our senses gave us warning. Starting, as we have seen, is\r\naccompanied by the blinking of the eyelids so as to protect the eyes,\r\nthe most tender and sensitive organs of the body; and it is, I believe,\r\nalways accompanied by a sudden and forcible inspiration, which is the\r\nnatural preparation for any violent effort. But when a man or horse\r\nstarts, his heart beats wildly against his ribs, and here it may be\r\ntruly said we have an organ which has never been under the control of\r\nthe will, partaking in the general reflex movements of the body. To\r\nthis point, however, I shall return in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nThe contraction of the iris, when the retina is stimulated by a bright\r\nlight, is another instance of a movement, which it appears cannot\r\npossibly have been at first voluntarily performed and then fixed by\r\nhabit; for the iris is not known to be under the conscious control of\r\nthe will in any animal. In such cases some explanation, quite distinct\r\nfrom habit, will have to be discovered. The radiation of nerve-force\r\nfrom strongly-excited nerve-cells to other connected cells, as in the\r\ncase of a bright light on the retina causing a sneeze, may perhaps aid\r\nus in understanding how some reflex actions originated. A radiation of\r\nnerve-force of this kind, if it caused a movement tending to lessen the\r\nprimary irritation, as in the case of the contraction of the iris\r\npreventing too much light from falling on the retina, might afterwards\r\nhave been taken advantage of and modified for this special purpose.\r\n\r\nIt further deserves notice that reflex actions are in all probability\r\nliable to slight variations, as are all corporeal structures and\r\ninstincts; and any variations which were beneficial and of sufficient\r\nimportance, would tend to be preserved and inherited. Thus reflex\r\nactions, when once gained for one purpose, might afterwards be modified\r\nindependently of the will or habit, so as to serve for some distinct\r\npurpose. Such cases would be parallel with those which, as we have\r\nevery reason to believe, have occurred with many instincts; for\r\nalthough some instincts have been developed simply through\r\nlong-continued and inherited habit, other highly complex ones have been\r\ndeveloped through the preservation of variations of pre-existing\r\ninstincts—that is, through natural selection.\r\n\r\nI have discussed at some little length, though as I am well aware, in a\r\nvery imperfect manner, the acquirement of reflex actions, because they\r\nare often brought into play in connection with movements expressive of\r\nour emotions; and it was necessary to show that at least some of them\r\nmight have been first acquired through the will in order to satisfy a\r\ndesire, or to relieve a disagreeable sensation.\r\n\r\n_Associated habitual movements in the lower animals_.—I have already\r\ngiven in the case of Man several instances of movements associated with\r\nvarious states of the mind or body, which are now purposeless, but\r\nwhich were originally of use, and are still of use under certain\r\ncircumstances. As this subject is very important for us, I will here\r\ngive a considerable number of analogous facts, with reference to\r\nanimals; although many of them are of a very trifling nature. My object\r\nis to show that certain movements were originally performed for a\r\ndefinite end, and that, under nearly the same circumstances, they are\r\nstill pertinaciously performed through habit when not of the least use.\r\nThat the tendency in most of the following cases is inherited, we may\r\ninfer from such actions being performed in the same manner by all the\r\nindividuals, young and old, of the same species. We shall also see that\r\nthey are excited by the most diversified, often circuitous, and\r\nsometimes mistaken associations.\r\n\r\nDogs, when they wish to go to sleep on a carpet or other hard surface,\r\ngenerally turn round and round and scratch the ground with their\r\nfore-paws in a senseless manner, as if they intended to trample down\r\nthe grass and scoop out a hollow, as no doubt their wild parents did,\r\nwhen they lived on open grassy plains or in the woods. Jackals,\r\nfennecs, and other allied animals in the Zoological Gardens, treat\r\ntheir straw in this manner; but it is a rather odd circumstance that\r\nthe keepers, after observing for some months, have never seen the\r\nwolves thus behave. A semi-idiotic dog—and an animal in this condition\r\nwould be particularly liable to follow a senseless habit—was observed\r\nby a friend to turn completely round on a carpet thirteen times before\r\ngoing to sleep.\r\n\r\nMany carnivorous animals, as they crawl towards their prey and prepare\r\nto rush or spring on it, lower their heads and crouch, partly, as it\r\nwould appear, to hide themselves, and partly to get ready for their\r\nrush; and this habit in an exaggerated form has become hereditary in\r\nour pointers and setters. Now I have noticed scores of times that when\r\ntwo strange dogs meet on an open road, the one which first sees the\r\nother, though at the distance of one or two hundred yards, after the\r\nfirst glance always lowers its bead, generally crouches a little, or\r\neven lies down; that is, he takes the proper attitude for concealing\r\nhimself and for making a rush or spring although the road is quite open\r\nand the distance great. Again, dogs of all kinds when intently watching\r\nand slowly approaching their prey, frequently keep one of their\r\nfore-legs doubled up for a long time, ready for the next cautious step;\r\nand this is eminently characteristic of the pointer. But from habit\r\nthey behave in exactly the same manner whenever their attention is\r\naroused (fig. 4). I have seen a dog at the foot of a high wall,\r\nlistening attentively to a sound on the opposite side, with one leg\r\ndoubled up; and in this case there could have been no intention of\r\nmaking a cautious approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall Dog Watching a Cat on A Table. Figure 4\r\n\r\n{illust. caption = for making a rush or FIG. 4.—Small dog watching a\r\ncat on a table. From a photograph taken by Mr. Rejlander.}\r\n\r\nDogs after voiding their excrement often make with all four feet a few\r\nscratches backwards, even on a bare stone pavement, as if for the\r\npurpose of covering up their excrement with earth, in nearly the same\r\nmanner as do cats. Wolves and jackals behave in the Zoological Gardens\r\nin exactly the same manner, yet, as I am assured by the keepers,\r\nneither wolves, jackals, nor foxes, when they have the means of doing\r\nso, ever cover up their excrement, any more than do dogs. All these\r\nanimals, however, bury superfluous food. Hence, if we rightly\r\nunderstand the meaning of the above cat-like habit, of which there can\r\nbe little doubt, we have a purposeless remnant of an habitual movement,\r\nwhich was originally followed by some remote progenitor of the\r\ndog-genus for a definite purpose, and which has been retained for a\r\nprodigious length of time.\r\n\r\nDogs and jackals[115] take much pleasure in rolling and rubbing their\r\nnecks and backs on carrion. The odour seems delightful to them, though\r\ndogs at least do not eat carrion. Mr. Bartlett has observed wolves for\r\nme, and has given them carrion, but has never seen them roll on it. I\r\nhave heard it remarked, and I believe it to be true, that the larger\r\ndogs, which are probably descended from wolves, do not so often roll in\r\ncarrion as do smaller dogs, which are probably descended from jackals.\r\nWhen a piece of brown biscuit is offered to a terrier of mine and she\r\nis not hungry (and I have heard of similar instances), she first tosses\r\nit about and worries it, as if it were a rat or other prey; she then\r\nrepeatedly rolls on it precisely as if it were a piece of carrion, and\r\nat last eats it. It would appear that an imaginary relish has to be\r\ngiven to the distasteful morsel; and to effect this the dog acts in his\r\nhabitual manner, as if the biscuit was a live animal or smelt like\r\ncarrion, though he knows better than we do that this is not the case. I\r\nhave seen this same terrier act in the same manner after killing a\r\nlittle bird or mouse.\r\n\r\nDogs scratch themselves by a rapid movement of one of their hind-feet;\r\nand when their backs are rubbed with a stick, so strong is the habit,\r\nthat they cannot help rapidly scratching the air or the ground in a\r\nuseless and ludicrous manner. The terrier just alluded to, when thus\r\nscratched with a stick, will sometimes show her delight by another\r\nhabitual movement, namely, by licking the air as if it were my hand.\r\n\r\nHorses scratch themselves by nibbling those parts of their bodies which\r\nthey can reach with their teeth; but more commonly one horse shows\r\nanother where he wants to be scratched, and they then nibble each\r\nother. A friend whose attention I had called to the subject, observed\r\nthat when he rubbed his horse’s neck, the animal protruded his head,\r\nuncovered his teeth, and moved his jaws, exactly as if nibbling another\r\nhorse’s neck, for he could never have nibbled his own neck. If a horse\r\nis much tickled, as when curry-combed, his wish to bite something\r\nbecomes so intolerably strong, that he will clatter his teeth together,\r\nand though not vicious, bite his groom. At the same time from habit he\r\nclosely depresses his ears, so as to protect them from being bitten, as\r\nif he were fighting with another horse.\r\n\r\nA horse when eager to start on a journey makes the nearest approach\r\nwhich he can to the habitual movement of progression by pawing the\r\nground. Now when horses in their stalls are about to be fed and are\r\neager for their corn, they paw the pavement or the straw. Two of my\r\nhorses thus behave when they see or hear the corn given to their\r\nneighbours. But here we have what may almost be called a true\r\nexpression, as pawing the ground is universally recognized as a sign of\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\nCats cover up their excrements of both kinds with earth; and my\r\ngrandfather[116] saw a kitten scraping ashes over a spoonful of pure\r\nwater spilt on the hearth; so that here an habitual or instinctive\r\naction was falsely excited, not by a previous act or by odour, but by\r\neyesight. It is well known that cats dislike wetting their feet, owing,\r\nit is probable, to their having aboriginally inhabited the dry country\r\nof Egypt; and when they wet their feet they shake them violently. My\r\ndaughter poured some water into a glass close to the head of a kitten;\r\nand it immediately shook its feet in the usual manner; so that here we\r\nhave an habitual movement falsely excited by an associated sound\r\ninstead of by the sense of touch.\r\n\r\nKittens, puppies, young pigs and probably many other young animals,\r\nalternately push with their forefeet against the mammary glands of\r\ntheir mothers, to excite a freer secretion of milk, or to make it flow.\r\nNow it is very common with young cats, and not at all rare with old\r\ncats of the common and Persian breeds (believed by some naturalists to\r\nbe specifically extinct), when comfortably lying on a warm shawl or\r\nother soft substance, to pound it quietly and alternately with their\r\nfore-feet; their toes being spread out and claws slightly protruded,\r\nprecisely as when sucking their mother. That it is the same movement is\r\nclearly shown by their often at the same time taking a bit of the shawl\r\ninto their mouths and sucking it; generally closing their eyes and\r\npurring from delight. This curious movement is commonly excited only in\r\nassociation with the sensation of a warm soft surface; but I have seen\r\nan old cat, when pleased by having its back scratched, pounding the air\r\nwith its feet in the same manner; so that this action has almost become\r\nthe expression of a pleasurable sensation.\r\n\r\nHaving referred to the act of sucking, I may add that this complex\r\nmovement, as well as the alternate protrusion of the fore-feet, are\r\nreflex actions; for they are performed if a finger moistened with milk\r\nis placed in the mouth of a puppy, the front part of whose brain has\r\nbeen removed.[117] It has recently been stated in France, that the\r\naction of sucking is excited solely through the sense of smell, so that\r\nif the olfactory nerves of a puppy are destroyed, it never sucks. In\r\nlike manner the wonderful power which a chicken possesses only a few\r\nhours after being hatched, of picking up small particles of food, seems\r\nto be started into action through the sense of hearing; for with\r\nchickens hatched by artificial heat, a good observer found that “making\r\na noise with the finger-nail against a board, in imitation of the\r\nhen-mother, first taught them to peck at their meat.”[118]\r\n\r\nI will give only one other instance of an habitual and purposeless\r\nmovement. The Sheldrake (_Tadorna_) feeds on the sands left uncovered\r\nby the tide, and when a worm-cast is discovered, “it begins patting the\r\nground with its feet, dancing as it were, over the hole;” and this\r\nmakes the worm come to the surface. Now Mr. St. John says, that when\r\nhis tame Sheldrakes “came to ask for food, they patted the ground in an\r\nimpatient and rapid manner.”[119] This therefore may almost be\r\nconsidered as their expression of hunger. Mr. Bartlett informs me that\r\nthe Flamingo and the Kagu (_Rhinochetus jubatus_) when anxious to be\r\nfed, beat the ground with their feet in the same odd manner. So again\r\nKingfishers, when they catch a fish, always beat it until it is killed;\r\nand in the Zoological Gardens they always beat the raw meat, with which\r\nthey are sometimes fed, before devouring it.\r\n\r\nWe have now, I think, sufficiently shown the truth of our first\r\nPrinciple, namely, that when any sensation, desire, dislike, &c., has\r\nled during a long series of generations to some voluntary movement,\r\nthen a tendency to the performance of a similar movement will almost\r\ncertainly be excited, whenever the same, or any analogous or associated\r\nsensation &c., although very weak, is experienced; notwithstanding that\r\nthe movement in this case may not be of the least use. Such habitual\r\nmovements are often, or generally inherited; and they then differ but\r\nlittle from reflex actions. When we treat of the special expressions of\r\nman, the latter part of our first Principle, as given at the\r\ncommencement of this chapter, will be seen to hold good; namely, that\r\nwhen movements, associated through habit with certain states of the\r\nmind, are partially repressed by the will, the strictly involuntary\r\nmuscles, as well as those which are least under the separate control of\r\nthe will, are liable still to act; and their action is often highly\r\nexpressive. Conversely, when the will is temporarily or permanently\r\nweakened, the voluntary muscles fail before the involuntary. It is a\r\nfact familiar to pathologists, as Sir C. Bell remarks,[120] “that when\r\ndebility arises from affection of the brain, the influence is greatest\r\non those muscles which are, in their natural condition, most under the\r\ncommand of the will.” We shall, also, in our future chapters, consider\r\nanother proposition included in our first Principle; namely, that the\r\nchecking of one habitual movement sometimes requires other slight\r\nmovements; these latter serving as a means of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EXPRESSION—_continued_.\r\n\r\nThe Principle of Antithesis—Instances in the dog and cat—Origin of the\r\nprinciple—Conventional signs—The principle of antithesis has not arisen\r\nfrom opposite actions being consciously performed under opposite\r\nimpulses.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider our second Principle, that of Antithesis. Certain\r\nstates of the mind lead, as we have seen in the last chapter, to\r\ncertain habitual movements which were primarily, or may still be, of\r\nservice; and we shall find that when a directly opposite state of mind\r\nis induced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the\r\nperformance of movements of a directly opposite nature, though these\r\nhave never been of any service. A few striking instances of antithesis\r\nwill be given, when we treat of the special expressions of man; but as,\r\nin these cases, we are particularly liable to confound conventional or\r\nartificial gestures and expressions with those which are innate or\r\nuniversal, and which alone deserve to rank as true expressions, I will\r\nin the present chapter almost confine myself to the lower animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDog in a Hostile Frame of Mind.  Fig. 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDog in a Hostile Frame of Mind.  Fig. 7\r\n\r\nWhen a dog approaches a strange dog or man in a savage or hostile frame\r\nof mind be walks upright and very stiffly; his head is slightly raised,\r\nor not much lowered; the tail is held erect, and quite rigid; the hairs\r\nbristle, especially along the neck and back; the pricked ears are\r\ndirected forwards, and the eyes have a fixed stare: (see figs. 5 and\r\n7). These actions, as will hereafter be explained, follow from the\r\ndog’s intention to attack his enemy, and are thus to a large extent\r\nintelligible. As he prepares to spring with a savage growl on his\r\nenemy, the canine teeth are uncovered, and the ears are pressed close\r\nbackwards on the head; but with these latter actions, we are not here\r\nconcerned. Let us now suppose that the dog suddenly discovers that the\r\nman he is approaching, is not a stranger, but his master; and let it be\r\nobserved how completely and instantaneously his whole bearing is\r\nreversed. Instead of walking upright, the body sinks downwards or even\r\ncrouches, and is thrown into flexuous movements; his tail, instead of\r\nbeing held stiff and upright, is lowered and wagged from side to side;\r\nhis hair instantly becomes smooth; his ears are depressed and drawn\r\nbackwards, but not closely to the head; and his lips hang loosely. From\r\nthe drawing back of the ears, the eyelids become elongated, and the\r\neyes no longer appear round and staring. It should be added that the\r\nanimal is at such times in an excited condition from joy; and\r\nnerve-force will be generated in excess, which naturally leads to\r\naction of some kind. Not one of the above movements, so clearly\r\nexpressive of affection, are of the least direct service to the animal.\r\nThey are explicable, as far as I can see, solely from being in complete\r\nopposition or antithesis to the attitude and movements which, from\r\nintelligible causes, are assumed when a dog intends to fight, and which\r\nconsequently are expressive of anger. I request the reader to look at\r\nthe four accompanying sketches, which have been given in order to\r\nrecall vividly the appearance of a dog under these two states of mind.\r\nIt is, however, not a little difficult to represent affection in a dog,\r\nwhilst caressing his master and wagging his tail, as the essence of the\r\nexpression lies in the continuous flexuous movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDog Carressing his Master.  Fig. 8\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the cat. When this animal is threatened by a dog,\r\nit arches its back in a surprising manner, erects its hair, opens its\r\nmouth and spits. But we are not here concerned with this well-known\r\nattitude, expressive of terror combined with anger; we are concerned\r\nonly with that of rage or anger. This is not often seen, but may be\r\nobserved when two cats are fighting together; and I have seen it well\r\nexhibited by a savage cat whilst plagued by a boy. The attitude is\r\nalmost exactly the same as that of a tiger disturbed and growling over\r\nits food, which every one must have beheld in menageries. The animal\r\nassumes a crouching position, with the body extended; and the whole\r\ntail, or the tip alone, is lashed or curled from side to side. The hair\r\nis not in the least erect. Thus far, the attitude and movements are\r\nnearly the same as when the animal is prepared to spring on its prey,\r\nand when, no doubt, it feels savage. But when preparing to fight, there\r\nis this difference, that the ears are closely pressed backwards; the\r\nmouth is partially opened, showing the teeth; the fore feet are\r\noccasionally struck out with protruded claws; and the animal\r\noccasionally utters a fierce growl. (See figs. 9 and 10.) All, or\r\nalmost all these actions naturally follow (as hereafter to be\r\nexplained), from the cat’s manner and intention of attacking its enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCat, Savage, and Prepared to Fight. Fig. 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCat in an Affectionate Frame of Mind. Fig. 10\r\n\r\nLet us now look at a cat in a directly opposite frame of mind, whilst\r\nfeeling affectionate and caressing her master; and mark how opposite is\r\nher attitude in every respect. She now stands upright with her back\r\nslightly arched, which makes the hair appear rather rough, but it does\r\nnot bristle; her tail, instead of being extended and lashed from side\r\nto side, is held quite still and perpendicularly upwards; her ears are\r\nerect and pointed; her mouth is closed; and she rubs against her master\r\nwith a purr instead of a growl. Let it further be observed how widely\r\ndifferent is the whole bearing of an affectionate cat from that of a\r\ndog, when with his body crouching and flexuous, his tail lowered and\r\nwagging, and ears depressed, he caresses his master. This contrast in\r\nthe attitudes and movements of these two carnivorous animals, under the\r\nsame pleased and affectionate frame of mind, can be explained, as it\r\nappears to me, solely by their movements standing in complete\r\nantithesis to those which are naturally assumed, when these animals\r\nfeel savage and are prepared either to fight or to seize their prey.\r\n\r\nIn these cases of the dog and cat, there is every reason to believe\r\nthat the gestures both of hostility and affection are innate or\r\ninherited; for they are almost identically the same in the different\r\nraces of the species, and in all the individuals of the same race, both\r\nyoung and old.\r\n\r\nI will here give one other instance of antithesis in expression. I\r\nformerly possessed a large dog, who, like every other dog, was much\r\npleased to go out walking. He showed his pleasure by trotting gravely\r\nbefore me with high steps, head much raised, moderately erected ears,\r\nand tail carried aloft but not stiffly. Not far from my house a path\r\nbranches off to the right, leading to the hot-house, which I used often\r\nto visit for a few moments, to look at my experimental plants. This was\r\nalways a great disappointment to the dog, as he did not know whether I\r\nshould continue my walk; and the instantaneous and complete change of\r\nexpression which came over him as soon as my body swerved in the least\r\ntowards the path (and I sometimes tried this as an experiment) was\r\nlaughable. His look of dejection was known to every member of the\r\nfamily, and was called his _hot-house face_. This consisted in the head\r\ndrooping much, the whole body sinking a little and remaining\r\nmotionless; the ears and tail falling suddenly down, but the tail was\r\nby no means wagged. With the falling of the ears and of his great\r\nchaps, the eyes became much changed in appearance, and I fancied that\r\nthey looked less bright. His aspect was that of piteous, hopeless\r\ndejection; and it was, as I have said, laughable, as the cause was so\r\nslight. Every detail in his attitude was in complete opposition to his\r\nformer joyful yet dignified bearing; and can be explained, as it\r\nappears to me, in no other way, except through the principle of\r\nantithesis. Had not the change been so instantaneous, I should have\r\nattributed it to his lowered spirits affecting, as in the case of man,\r\nthe nervous system and circulation, and consequently the tone of his\r\nwhole muscular frame; and this may have been in part the cause.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider how the principle of antithesis in expression has\r\narisen. With social animals, the power of intercommunication between\r\nthe members of the same community,—and with other species, between the\r\nopposite sexes, as well as between the young and the old,—is of the\r\nhighest importance to them. This is generally effected by means of the\r\nvoice, but it is certain that gestures and expressions are to a certain\r\nextent mutually intelligible. Man not only uses inarticulate cries,\r\ngestures, and expressions, but has invented articulate language; if,\r\nindeed, the word INVENTED can be applied to a process, completed by\r\ninnumerable steps, half-consciously made. Any one who has watched\r\nmonkeys will not doubt that they perfectly understand each other’s\r\ngestures and expression, and to a large extent, as Rengger\r\nasserts,[201] those of man. An animal when going to attack another, or\r\nwhen afraid of another, often makes itself appear terrible, by erecting\r\nits hair, thus increasing the apparent bulk of its body, by showing its\r\nteeth, or brandishing its horns, or by uttering fierce sounds.\r\n\r\nAs the power of intercommunication is certainly of high service to many\r\nanimals, there is no _à priori_ improbability in the supposition, that\r\ngestures manifestly of an opposite nature to those by which certain\r\nfeelings are already expressed, should at first have been voluntarily\r\nemployed under the influence of an opposite state of feeling. The fact\r\nof the gestures being now innate, would be no valid objection to the\r\nbelief that they were at first intentional; for if practised during\r\nmany generations, they would probably at last be inherited.\r\nNevertheless it is more than doubtful, as we shall immediately see,\r\nwhether any of the cases which come under our present head of\r\nantithesis, have thus originated.\r\n\r\nWith conventional signs which are not innate, such as those used by the\r\ndeaf and dumb and by savages, the principle of opposition or antithesis\r\nhas been partially brought into play. The Cistercian monks thought it\r\nsinful to speak, and as they could not avoid holding some\r\ncommunication, they invented a gesture language, in which the principle\r\nof opposition seems to have been employed.[202] Dr. Scott, of the\r\nExeter Deaf and Dumb Institution, writes to me that “opposites are\r\ngreatly used in teaching the deaf and dumb, who have a lively sense of\r\nthem.” Nevertheless I have been surprised how few unequivocal instances\r\ncan be adduced. This depends partly on all the signs having commonly\r\nhad some natural origin; and partly on the practice of the deaf and\r\ndumb and of savages to contract their signs as much as possible for the\r\nsake of rapidity.[203] Hence their natural source or origin often\r\nbecomes doubtful or is completely lost; as is likewise the case with\r\narticulate language.\r\n\r\nMany signs, moreover, which plainly stand in opposition to each other,\r\nappear to have had on both sides a significant origin. This seems to\r\nhold good with the signs used by the deal and dumb for light and\r\ndarkness, for strength and weakness, &c. In a future chapter I shall\r\nendeavour to show that the opposite gestures of affirmation and\r\nnegation, namely, vertically nodding and laterally shaking the head,\r\nhave both probably had a natural beginning. The waving of the hand from\r\nright to left, which is used as a negative by some savages, may have\r\nbeen invented in imitation of shaking the head; but whether the\r\nopposite movement of waving the hand in a straight line from the face,\r\nwhich is used in affirmation, has arisen through antithesis or in some\r\nquite distinct manner, is doubtful.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the gestures which are innate or common to all the\r\nindividuals of the same species, and which come under the present head\r\nof antithesis, it is extremely doubtful, whether any of them were at\r\nfirst deliberately invented and consciously performed. With mankind the\r\nbest instance of a gesture standing in direct opposition to other\r\nmovements, naturally assumed under an opposite frame of mind, is that\r\nof shrugging the shoulders. This expresses impotence or an\r\napology,—something which cannot be done, or cannot be avoided. The\r\ngesture is sometimes used consciously and voluntarily, but it is\r\nextremely improbable that it was at first deliberately invented, and\r\nafterwards fixed by habit; for not only do young children sometimes\r\nshrug their shoulders under the above states of mind, but the movement\r\nis accompanied, as will be shown in a future chapter, by various\r\nsubordinate movements, which not one man in a thousand is aware of,\r\nunless he has specially attended to the subject.\r\n\r\nDogs when approaching a strange dog, may find it useful to show by\r\ntheir movements that they are friendly, and do not wish to fight. When\r\ntwo young dogs in play are growling and biting each other’s faces and\r\nlegs, it is obvious that they mutually understand each other’s gestures\r\nand manners. There seems, indeed, some degree of instinctive knowledge\r\nin puppies and kittens, that they must not use their sharp little teeth\r\nor claws too freely in their play, though this sometimes happens and a\r\nsqueal is the result; otherwise they would often injure each other’s\r\neyes. When my terrier bites my hand in play, often snarling at the same\r\ntime, if he bites too hard and I say GENTLY, GENTLY, he goes on biting,\r\nbut answers me by a few wags of the tail, which seems to say “Never\r\nmind, it is all fun.” Although dogs do thus express, and may wish to\r\nexpress, to other dogs and to man, that they are in a friendly state of\r\nmind, it is incredible that they could ever have deliberately thought\r\nof drawing back and depressing their ears, instead of holding them\r\nerect,—of lowering and wagging their tails, instead of keeping them\r\nstiff and upright, &c., because they knew that these movements stood in\r\ndirect opposition to those assumed under an opposite and savage frame\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nAgain, when a cat, or rather when some early progenitor of the species,\r\nfrom feeling affectionate first slightly arched its back, held its tail\r\nperpendicularly upwards and pricked its ears, can it be believed that\r\nthe animal consciously wished thus to show that its frame of mind was\r\ndirectly the reverse of that, when from being ready to fight or to\r\nspring on its prey, it assumed a crouching attitude, curled its tail\r\nfrom side to side and depressed its ears? Even still less can I believe\r\nthat my dog voluntarily put on his dejected attitude and “_hot-house\r\nface_,” which formed so complete a contrast to his previous cheerful\r\nattitude and whole bearing. It cannot be supposed that he knew that I\r\nshould understand his expression, and that he could thus soften my\r\nheart and make me give up visiting the hot-house.\r\n\r\nHence for the development of the movements which come under the present\r\nhead, some other principle, distinct from the will and consciousness,\r\nmust have intervened. This principle appears to be that every movement\r\nwhich we have voluntarily performed throughout our lives has required\r\nthe action of certain muscles; and when we have performed a directly\r\nopposite movement, an opposite set of muscles has been habitually\r\nbrought into play,—as in turning to the right or to the left, in\r\npushing away or pulling an object towards us, and in lifting or\r\nlowering a weight. So strongly are our intentions and movements\r\nassociated together, that if we eagerly wish an object to move in any\r\ndirection, we can hardly avoid moving our bodies in the same direction,\r\nalthough we may be perfectly aware that this can have no influence. A\r\ngood illustration of this fact has already been given in the\r\nIntroduction, namely, in the grotesque movements of a young and eager\r\nbilliard-player, whilst watching the course of his ball. A man or child\r\nin a passion, if he tells any one in a loud voice to begone, generally\r\nmoves his arm as if to push him away, although the offender may not be\r\nstanding near, and although there may be not the least need to explain\r\nby a gesture what is meant. On the other hand, if we eagerly desire\r\nsome one to approach us closely, we act as if pulling him towards us;\r\nand so in innumerable other instances.\r\n\r\nAs the performance of ordinary movements of an opposite kind, under\r\nopposite impulses of the will, has become habitual in us and in the\r\nlower animals, so when actions of one kind have become firmly\r\nassociated with any sensation or emotion, it appears natural that\r\nactions of a directly opposite kind, though of no use, should be\r\nunconsciously performed through habit and association, under the\r\ninfluence of a directly opposite sensation or emotion. On this\r\nprinciple alone can I understand how the gestures and expressions which\r\ncome under the present head of antithesis have originated. If indeed\r\nthey are serviceable to man or to any other animal, in aid of\r\ninarticulate cries or language, they will likewise be voluntarily\r\nemployed, and the habit will thus be strengthened. But whether or not\r\nof service as a means of communication, the tendency to perform\r\nopposite movements under opposite sensations or emotions would, if we\r\nmay judge by analogy, become hereditary through long practice; and\r\nthere cannot be a doubt that several expressive movements due to the\r\nprinciple of antithesis are inherited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EXPRESSION—_concluded_.\r\n\r\nThe principle of direct action of the excited nervous system on the\r\nbody, independently of the will and in part of habit—Change of colour\r\nin the hair—Trembling of the muscles—Modified\r\nsecretions—Perspiration—Expression of extreme pain—Of rage, great joy,\r\nand terror—Contrast between the emotions which cause and do not cause\r\nexpressive movements—Exciting and depressing states of the\r\nmind—Summary.\r\n\r\nWe now come to our third Principle, namely, that certain actions which\r\nwe recognize as expressive of certain states of the mind, are the\r\ndirect result of the constitution of the nervous system, and have been\r\nfrom the first independent of the will, and, to a large extent, of\r\nhabit. When the sensorium is strongly excited nerve-force is generated\r\nin excess, and is transmitted in certain directions, dependent on the\r\nconnection of the nerve-cells, and, as far as the muscular system is\r\nconcerned, on the nature of the movements which have been habitually\r\npractised. Or the supply of nerve-force may, as it appears, be\r\ninterrupted. Of course every movement which we make is determined by\r\nthe constitution of the nervous system; but actions performed in\r\nobedience to the will, or through habit, or through the principle of\r\nantithesis, are here as far as possible excluded. Our present subject\r\nis very obscure, but, from its importance, must be discussed at some\r\nlittle length; and it is always advisable to perceive clearly our\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nThe most striking case, though a rare and abnormal one, which can be\r\nadduced of the direct influence of the nervous system, when strongly\r\naffected, on the body, is the loss of colour in the hair, which has\r\noccasionally been observed after extreme terror or grief. One authentic\r\ninstance has been recorded, in the case of a man brought out for\r\nexecution in India, in which the change of colour was so rapid that it\r\nwas perceptible to the eye.[301]\r\n\r\nAnother good case is that of the trembling of the muscles, which is\r\ncommon to man and to many, or most, of the lower animals. Trembling is\r\nof no service, often of much disservice, and cannot have been at first\r\nacquired through the will, and then rendered habitual in association\r\nwith any emotion. I am assured by an eminent authority that young\r\nchildren do not tremble, but go into convulsions under the\r\ncircumstances which would induce excessive trembling in adults.\r\nTrembling is excited in different individuals in very different degrees\r\nand by the most diversified causes,—by cold to the surface, before\r\nfever-fits, although the temperature of the body is then above the\r\nnormal standard; in blood-poisoning, delirium tremens, and other\r\ndiseases; by general failure of power in old age; by exhaustion after\r\nexcessive fatigue; locally from severe injuries, such as burns; and, in\r\nan especial manner, by the passage of a catheter. Of all emotions, fear\r\nnotoriously is the most apt to induce trembling; but so do occasionally\r\ngreat anger and joy. I remember once seeing a boy who had just shot his\r\nfirst snipe on the wing, and his hands trembled to such a degree from\r\ndelight, that he could not for some time reload his gun; and I have\r\nheard of an exactly similar case with an Australian savage, to whom a\r\ngun had been lent. Fine music, from the vague emotions thus excited,\r\ncauses a shiver to run down the backs of some persons. There seems to\r\nbe very little in common in the above several physical causes and\r\nemotions to account for trembling; and Sir J. Paget, to whom I am\r\nindebted for several of the above statements, informs me that the\r\nsubject is a very obscure one. As trembling is sometimes caused by\r\nrage, long before exhaustion can have set in, and as it sometimes\r\naccompanies great joy, it would appear that any strong excitement of\r\nthe nervous system interrupts the steady flow of nerve-force to the\r\nmuscles.[302]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the secretions of the alimentary canal and of\r\ncertain glands—as the liver, kidneys, or mammæ are affected by strong\r\nemotions, is another excellent instance of the direct action of the\r\nsensorium on these organs, independently of the will or of any\r\nserviceable associated habit. There is the greatest difference in\r\ndifferent persons in the parts which are thus affected, and in the\r\ndegree of their affection.\r\n\r\nThe heart, which goes on uninterruptedly beating night and day in so\r\nwonderful a manner, is extremely sensitive to external stimulants. The\r\ngreat physiologist, Claude Bernard,[303] has shown how the least\r\nexcitement of a sensitive nerve reacts on the heart; even when a nerve\r\nis touched so slightly that no pain can possibly be felt by the animal\r\nunder experiment. Hence when the mind is strongly excited, we might\r\nexpect that it would instantly affect in a direct manner the heart; and\r\nthis is universally acknowledged and felt to be the case. Claude\r\nBernard also repeatedly insists, and this deserves especial notice,\r\nthat when the heart is affected it reacts on the brain; and the state\r\nof the brain again reacts through the pneumo-gastric nerve on the\r\nheart; so that under any excitement there will be much mutual action\r\nand reaction between these, the two most important organs of the body.\r\n\r\nThe vaso-motor system, which regulates the diameter of the small\r\narteries, is directly acted on by the sensorium, as we see when a man\r\nblushes from shame; but in this latter case the checked transmission of\r\nnerve-force to the vessels of the face can, I think, be partly\r\nexplained in a curious manner through habit. We shall also be able to\r\nthrow some light, though very little, on the involuntary erection of\r\nthe hair under the emotions of terror and rage. The secretion of tears\r\ndepends, no doubt, on the connection of certain nerve-cells; but here\r\nagain we can trace some few of the steps by which the flow of\r\nnerve-force through the requisite channels has become habitual under\r\ncertain emotions.\r\n\r\nA brief consideration of the outward signs of some of the stronger\r\nsensations and emotions will best serve to show us, although vaguely,\r\nin how complex a manner the principle under consideration of the direct\r\naction of the excited nervous system of the body, is combined with the\r\nprinciple of habitually associated, serviceable movements.\r\n\r\nWhen animals suffer from an agony of pain, they generally writhe about\r\nwith frightful contortions; and those which habitually use their voices\r\nutter piercing cries or groans. Almost every muscle of the body is\r\nbrought into strong action. With man the mouth may be closely\r\ncompressed, or more commonly the lips are retracted, with the teeth\r\nclenched or ground together. There is said to be “gnashing of teeth” in\r\nhell; and I have plainly heard the grinding of the molar teeth of a cow\r\nwhich was suffering acutely from inflammation of the bowels. The female\r\nhippopotamus in the Zoological Gardens, when she produced her young,\r\nsuffered greatly; she incessantly walked about, or rolled on her sides,\r\nopening and closing her jaws, and clattering her teeth together.[304]\r\nWith man the eyes stare wildly as in horrified astonishment, or the\r\nbrows are heavily contracted. Perspiration bathes the body, and drops\r\ntrickle down the face. The circulation and respiration are much\r\naffected. Hence the nostrils are generally dilated and often quiver; or\r\nthe breath may be held until the blood stagnates in the purple face. If\r\nthe agony be severe and prolonged, these signs all change; utter\r\nprostration follows, with fainting or convulsions.\r\n\r\nA sensitive nerve when irritated transmits some influence to the\r\nnerve-cell, whence it proceeds; and this transmits its influence, first\r\nto the corresponding nerve-cell on the opposite side of the body, and\r\nthen upwards and downwards along the cerebro-spinal column to other\r\nnerve-cells, to a greater or less extent, according to the strength of\r\nthe excitement; so that, ultimately, the whole nervous system maybe\r\naffected.[305] This involuntary transmission of nerve-force may or may\r\nnot be accompanied by consciousness. Why the irritation of a nerve-cell\r\nshould generate or liberate nerve-force is not known; but that this is\r\nthe case seems to be the conclusion arrived at by all the greatest\r\nphysiologists, such as Müller, Virchow, Bernard, &c.[306] As Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer remarks, it may be received as an “unquestionable truth\r\nthat, at any moment, the existing quantity of liberated nerve-force,\r\nwhich in an inscrutable way produces in us the state we call feeling,\r\nMUST expend itself in some direction—MUST generate an equivalent\r\nmanifestation of force somewhere;” so that, when the cerebro-spinal\r\nsystem is highly excited and nerve-force is liberated in excess, it may\r\nbe expended in intense sensations, active thought, violent movements,\r\nor increased activity of the glands.[307] Mr. Spencer further maintains\r\nthat an “overflow of nerve-force, undirected by any motive, will\r\nmanifestly take the most habitual routes; and, if these do not suffice,\r\nwill next overflow into the less habitual ones.” Consequently the\r\nfacial and respiratory muscles, which are the most used, will be apt to\r\nbe first brought into action; then those of the upper extremities, next\r\nthose of the lower, and finally those of the whole body.[308]\r\n\r\nAn emotion may be very strong, but it will have little tendency to\r\ninduce movements of any kind, if it has not commonly led to voluntary\r\naction for its relief or gratification; and when movements are excited,\r\ntheir nature is, to a large extent, determined by those which have\r\noften and voluntarily been performed for some definite end under the\r\nsame emotion. Great pain urges all animals, and has urged them during\r\nendless generations, to make the most violent and diversified efforts\r\nto escape from the cause of suffering. Even when a limb or other\r\nseparate part of the body is hurt, we often see a tendency to shake it,\r\nas if to shake off the cause, though this may obviously be impossible.\r\nThus a habit of exerting with the utmost force all the muscles will\r\nhave been established, whenever great suffering is experienced. As the\r\nmuscles of the chest and vocal organs are habitually used, these will\r\nbe particularly liable to be acted on, and loud, harsh screams or cries\r\nwill be uttered. But the advantage derived from outcries has here\r\nprobably come into play in an important manner; for the young of most\r\nanimals, when in distress or danger, call loudly to their parents for\r\naid, as do the members of the same community for mutual aid.\r\n\r\nAnother principle, namely, the internal consciousness that the power or\r\ncapacity of the nervous system is limited, will have strengthened,\r\nthough in a subordinate degree, the tendency to violent action under\r\nextreme suffering. A man cannot think deeply and exert his utmost\r\nmuscular force. As Hippocrates long ago observed, if two pains are felt\r\nat the same time, the severer one dulls the other. Martyrs, in the\r\necstasy of their religious fervour have often, as it would appear, been\r\ninsensible to the most horrid tortures. Sailors who are going to be\r\nflogged sometimes take a piece of lead into their mouths, in order to\r\nbite it with their utmost force, and thus to bear the pain. Parturient\r\nwomen prepare to exert their muscles to the utmost in order to relieve\r\ntheir sufferings.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the undirected radiation of nerve-force from the\r\nnerve-cells which are first affected—the long-continued habit of\r\nattempting by struggling to escape from the cause of suffering—and the\r\nconsciousness that voluntary muscular exertion relieves pain, have all\r\nprobably concurred in giving a tendency to the most violent, almost\r\nconvulsive, movements under extreme suffering; and such movements,\r\nincluding those of the vocal organs, are universally recognized as\r\nhighly expressive of this condition.\r\n\r\nAs the mere touching of a sensitive nerve reacts in a direct manner on\r\nthe heart, severe pain will obviously react on it in like manner, but\r\nfar more energetically. Nevertheless, even in this case, we must not\r\noverlook the indirect effects of habit on the heart, as we shall see\r\nwhen we consider the signs of rage.\r\n\r\nWhen a man suffers from an agony of pain, the perspiration often\r\ntrickles down his face; and I have been assured by a veterinary surgeon\r\nthat he has frequently seen drops falling from the belly and running\r\ndown the inside of the thighs of horses, and from the bodies of cattle,\r\nwhen thus suffering. He has observed this, when there has been no\r\nstruggling which would account for the perspiration. The whole body of\r\nthe female hippopotamus, before alluded to, was covered with\r\nred-coloured perspiration whilst giving birth to her young. So it is\r\nwith extreme fear; the same veterinary has often seen horses sweating\r\nfrom this cause; as has Mr. Bartlett with the rhinoceros; and with man\r\nit is a well-known symptom. The cause of perspiration bursting forth in\r\nthese cases is quite obscure; but it is thought by some physiologists\r\nto be connected with the failing power of the capillary circulation;\r\nand we know that the vasomotor system, which regulates the capillary\r\ncirculation, is much influenced by the mind. With respect to the\r\nmovements of certain muscles of the face under great suffering, as well\r\nas from other emotions, these will be best considered when we treat of\r\nthe special expressions of man and of the lower animals.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the characteristic symptoms of Rage. Under this\r\npowerful emotion the action of the heart is much accelerated,[309] or\r\nit may be much disturbed. The face reddens, or it becomes purple from\r\nthe impeded return of the blood, or may turn deadly pale. The\r\nrespiration is laboured, the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils\r\nquiver. The whole body often trembles. The voice is affected. The teeth\r\nare clenched or ground together, and the muscular system is commonly\r\nstimulated to violent, almost frantic action. But the gestures of a man\r\nin this state usually differ from the purposeless writhings and\r\nstruggles of one suffering from an agony of pain; for they represent\r\nmore or less plainly the act of striking or fighting with an enemy.\r\n\r\nAll these signs of rage are probably in large part, and some of them\r\nappear to be wholly, due to the direct action of the excited sensorium.\r\nBut animals of all kinds, and their progenitors before them, when\r\nattacked or threatened by an enemy, have exerted their utmost powers in\r\nfighting and in defending themselves. Unless an animal does thus act,\r\nor has the intention, or at least the desire, to attack its enemy, it\r\ncannot properly be said to be enraged. An inherited habit of muscular\r\nexertion will thus have been gained in association with rage; and this\r\nwill directly or indirectly affect various organs, in nearly the same\r\nmanner as does great bodily suffering.\r\n\r\nThe heart no doubt will likewise be affected in a direct manner; but it\r\nwill also in all probability be affected through habit; and all the\r\nmore so from not being under the control of the will. We know that any\r\ngreat exertion which we voluntarily make, affects the heart, through\r\nmechanical and other principles which need not here be considered; and\r\nit was shown in the first chapter that nerve-force flows readily\r\nthrough habitually used channels,—through the nerves of voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary movement, and through those of sensation. Thus even a\r\nmoderate amount of exertion will tend to act on the heart; and on the\r\nprinciple of association, of which so many instances have been given,\r\nwe may feel nearly sure that any sensation or emotion, as great pain or\r\nrage, which has habitually led to much muscular action, will\r\nimmediately influence the flow of nerve-force to the heart, although\r\nthere may not be at the time any muscular exertion.\r\n\r\nThe heart, as I have said, will be all the more readily affected\r\nthrough habitual associations, as it is not under the control of the\r\nwill. A man when moderately angry, or even when enraged, may command\r\nthe movements of his body, but he cannot prevent his heart from beating\r\nrapidly. His chest will perhaps give a few heaves, and his nostrils\r\njust quiver, for the movements of respiration are only in part\r\nvoluntary. In like manner those muscles of the face which are least\r\nobedient to the will, will sometimes alone betray a slight and passing\r\nemotion. The glands again are wholly independent of the will, and a man\r\nsuffering from grief may command his features, but cannot always\r\nprevent the tears from coming into his eyes. A hungry man, if tempting\r\nfood is placed before him, may not show his hunger by any outward\r\ngesture, but he cannot check the secretion of saliva.\r\n\r\nUnder a transport of Joy or of vivid Pleasure, there is a strong\r\ntendency to various purposeless movements, and to the utterance of\r\nvarious sounds. We see this in our young children, in their loud\r\nlaughter, clapping of hands, and jumping for joy; in the bounding and\r\nbarking of a dog when going out to walk with his master; and in the\r\nfrisking of a horse when turned out into an open field. Joy quickens\r\nthe circulation, and this stimulates the brain, which again reacts on\r\nthe whole body. The above purposeless movements and increased\r\nheart-action may be attributed in chief part to the excited state of\r\nthe sensorium,[310] and to the consequent undirected overflow, as Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer insists, of nerve-force. It deserves notice, that it is\r\nchiefly the anticipation of a pleasure, and not its actual enjoyment,\r\nwhich leads to purposeless and extravagant movements of the body, and\r\nto the utterance of various sounds. We see this in our children when\r\nthey expect any great pleasure or treat; and dogs, which have been\r\nbounding about at the sight of a plate of food, when they get it do not\r\nshow their delight by any outward sign, not even by wagging their\r\ntails. Now with animals of all kinds, the acquirement of almost all\r\ntheir pleasures, with the exception of those of warmth and rest, are\r\nassociated, and have long been associated with active movements, as in\r\nthe hunting or search for food, and in their courtship. Moreover, the\r\nmere exertion of the muscles after long rest or confinement is in\r\nitself a pleasure, as we ourselves feel, and as we see in the play of\r\nyoung animals. Therefore on this latter principle alone we might\r\nperhaps expect, that vivid pleasure would be apt to show itself\r\nconversely in muscular movements.\r\n\r\nWith all or almost all animals, even with birds, Terror causes the body\r\nto tremble. The skin becomes pale, sweat breaks out, and the hair\r\nbristles. The secretions of the alimentary canal and of the kidneys are\r\nincreased, and they are involuntarily voided, owing to the relaxation\r\nof the sphincter muscles, as is known to be the case with man, and as I\r\nhave seen with cattle, dogs, cats, and monkeys. The breathing is\r\nhurried. The heart beats quickly, wildly, and violently; but whether it\r\npumps the blood more efficiently through the body may be doubted, for\r\nthe surface seems bloodless and the strength of the muscles soon fails.\r\nIn a frightened horse I have felt through the saddle the beating of the\r\nheart so plainly that I could have counted the beats. The mental\r\nfaculties are much disturbed. Utter prostration soon follows, and even\r\nfainting. A terrified canary-bird has been seen not only to tremble and\r\nto turn white about the base of the bill, but to faint;[311] and I once\r\ncaught a robin in a room, which fainted so completely, that for a time\r\nI thought it dead.\r\n\r\nMost of these symptoms are probably the direct result, independently of\r\nhabit, of the disturbed state of the sensorium; but it is doubtful\r\nwhether they ought to be wholly thus accounted for. When an animal is\r\nalarmed it almost always stands motionless for a moment, in order to\r\ncollect its senses and to ascertain the source of danger, and sometimes\r\nfor the sake of escaping detection. But headlong flight soon follows,\r\nwith no husbanding of the strength as in fighting, and the animal\r\ncontinues to fly as long as the danger lasts, until utter prostration,\r\nwith failing respiration and circulation, with all the muscles\r\nquivering and profuse sweating, renders further flight impossible.\r\nHence it does not seem improbable that the principle of associated\r\nhabit may in part account for, or at least augment, some of the\r\nabove-named characteristic symptoms of extreme terror.\r\n\r\nThat the principle of associated habit has played an important part in\r\ncausing the movements expressive of the foregoing several strong\r\nemotions and sensations, we may, I think, conclude from considering\r\nfirstly, some other strong emotions which do not ordinarily require for\r\ntheir relief or gratification any voluntary movement; and secondly the\r\ncontrast in nature between the so-called exciting and depressing states\r\nof the mind. No emotion is stronger than maternal love; but a mother\r\nmay feel the deepest love for her helpless infant, and yet not show it\r\nby any outward sign; or only by slight caressing movements, with a\r\ngentle smile and tender eyes. But let any one intentionally injure her\r\ninfant, and see what a change! how she starts up with threatening\r\naspect, how her eyes sparkle and her face reddens, how her bosom\r\nheaves, nostrils dilate, and heart beats; for anger, and not maternal\r\nlove, has habitually led to action. The love between the opposite sexes\r\nis widely different from maternal love; and when lovers meet, we know\r\nthat their hearts beat quickly, their breathing is hurried, and their\r\nfaces flush; for this love is not inactive like that of a mother for\r\nher infant.\r\n\r\nA man may have his mind filled with the blackest hatred or suspicion,\r\nor be corroded with envy or jealousy, but as these feelings do not at\r\nonce lead to action, and as they commonly last for some time, they are\r\nnot shown by any outward sign, excepting that a man in this state\r\nassuredly does not appear cheerful or good-tempered. If indeed these\r\nfeelings break out into overt acts, rage takes their place, and will be\r\nplainly exhibited. Painters can hardly portray suspicion, jealousy,\r\nenvy, &c., except by the aid of accessories which tell the tale; and\r\npoets use such vague and fanciful expressions as “green-eyed jealousy.”\r\nSpenser describes suspicion as “Foul, ill-favoured, and grim, under his\r\neyebrows looking still askance,” &c.; Shakespeare speaks of envy “as\r\nlean-faced in her loathsome case;” and in another place he says, “no\r\nblack envy shall make my grave;” and again as “above pale envy’s\r\nthreatening reach.”\r\n\r\nEmotions and sensations have often been classed as exciting or\r\ndepressing. When all the organs of the body and mind,—those of\r\nvoluntary and involuntary movement, of perception, sensation, thought,\r\n&c.,—perform their functions more energetically and rapidly than usual,\r\na man or animal may be said to be excited, and, under an opposite\r\nstate, to be depressed. Anger and joy are from the first exciting\r\nemotions, and they naturally lead, more especially the former, to\r\nenergetic movements, which react on the heart and this again on the\r\nbrain. A physician once remarked to me as a proof of the exciting\r\nnature of anger, that a man when excessively jaded will sometimes\r\ninvent imaginary offences and put himself into a passion, unconsciously\r\nfor the sake of reinvigorating himself; and since hearing this remark,\r\nI have occasionally recognized its full truth.\r\n\r\nSeveral other states of mind appear to be at first exciting, but soon\r\nbecome depressing to an extreme degree. When a mother suddenly loses\r\nher child, sometimes she is frantic with grief, and must be considered\r\nto be in an excited state; she walks wildly about, tears her hair or\r\nclothes, and wrings her hands. This latter action is perhaps due to the\r\nprinciple of antithesis, betraying an inward sense of helplessness and\r\nthat nothing can be done. The other wild and violent movements may be\r\nin part explained by the relief experienced through muscular exertion,\r\nand in part by the undirected overflow of nerve-force from the excited\r\nsensorium. But under the sudden loss of a beloved person, one of the\r\nfirst and commonest thoughts which occurs, is that something more might\r\nhave been done to save the lost one. An excellent observer,[312] in\r\ndescribing the behaviour of a girl at the sudden death of her father,\r\nsays she “went about the house wringing her hands like a creature\r\ndemented, saying ‘It was her fault;’ ‘I should never have left him;’\r\n‘If I had only sat up with him,’” &c. With such ideas vividly present\r\nbefore the mind, there would arise, through the principle of associated\r\nhabit, the strongest tendency to energetic action of some kind.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sufferer is fully conscious that nothing can be done,\r\ndespair or deep sorrow takes the place of frantic grief. The sufferer\r\nsits motionless, or gently rocks to and fro; the circulation becomes\r\nlanguid; respiration is almost forgotten, and deep sighs are drawn. All\r\nthis reacts on the brain, and prostration soon follows with collapsed\r\nmuscles and dulled eyes. As associated habit no longer prompts the\r\nsufferer to action, he is urged by his friends to voluntary exertion,\r\nand not to give way to silent, motionless grief. Exertion stimulates\r\nthe hear, and this reacts on the brain, and aids the mind to bear its\r\nheavy load.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain, if severe, soon induces extreme depression or prostration; but it\r\nis at first a stimulant and excites to action, as we see when we whip a\r\nhorse, and as is shown by the horrid tortures inflicted in foreign\r\nlands on exhausted dray-bullocks, to rouse them to renewed exertion.\r\nFear again is the most depressing of all the emotions; and it soon\r\ninduces utter, helpless prostration, as if in consequence of, or in\r\nassociation with, the most violent and prolonged attempts to escape\r\nfrom the danger, though no such attempts have actually been made.\r\nNevertheless, even extreme fear often acts at first as a powerful\r\nstimulant. A man or animal driven through terror to desperation, is\r\nendowed with wonderful strength, and is notoriously dangerous in the\r\nhighest degree.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we may conclude that the principle of the direct action of\r\nthe sensorium on the body, due to the constitution of the nervous\r\nsystem, and from the first independent of the will, has been highly\r\ninfluential in determining many expressions. Good instances are\r\nafforded by the trembling of the muscles, the sweating of the skin, the\r\nmodified secretions of the alimentary canal and glands, under various\r\nemotions and sensations. But actions of this kind are often combined\r\nwith others, which follow from our first principle, namely, that\r\nactions which have often been of direct or indirect service, under\r\ncertain states of the mind, in order to gratify or relieve certain\r\nsensations, desires, &c., are still performed under analogous\r\ncircumstances through mere habit although of no service. We have\r\ncombinations of this kind, at least in part, in the frantic gestures of\r\nrage and in the writhings of extreme pain; and, perhaps, in the\r\nincreased action of the heart and of the respiratory organs. Even when\r\nthese and other emotions or sensations are aroused in a very feeble\r\nmanner, there will still be a tendency to similar actions, owing to the\r\nforce of long-associated habit; and those actions which are least under\r\nvoluntary control will generally be longest retained. Our second\r\nprinciple of antithesis has likewise occasionally come into play.\r\n\r\nFinally, so many expressive movements can be explained, as I trust will\r\nbe seen in the course of this volume, through the three principles\r\nwhich have now been discussed, that we may hope hereafter to see all\r\nthus explained, or by closely analogous principles. It is, however,\r\noften impossible to decide how much weight ought to be attributed, in\r\neach particular case, to one of our principles, and how much to\r\nanother; and very many points in the theory of Expression remain\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. MEANS OF EXPRESSION IN ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe emission of Sounds—Vocal sounds—Sounds otherwise produced—Erection\r\nof the dermal appendages, hairs, feathers, &c., under the emotions of\r\nanger and terror—The drawing back of the ears as a preparation for\r\nfighting, and as an expression of anger—Erection of the ears and\r\nraising the head, a sign of attention.\r\n\r\nIn this and the following chapter I will describe, but only in\r\nsufficient detail to illustrate my subject, the expressive movements,\r\nunder different states of the mind, of some few well-known animals. But\r\nbefore considering them in due succession, it will save much useless\r\nrepetition to discuss certain means of expression common to most of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_The emission of Sounds_.—With many kinds of animals, man included, the\r\nvocal organs are efficient in the highest degree as a means of\r\nexpression. We have seen, in the last chapter, that when the sensorium\r\nis strongly excited, the muscles of the body are generally thrown into\r\nviolent action; and as a consequence, loud sounds are uttered, however\r\nsilent the animal may generally be, and although the sounds may be of\r\nno use. Hares and rabbits for instance, never, I believe, use their\r\nvocal organs except in the extremity of suffering; as, when a wounded\r\nhare is killed by the sportsman, or when a young rabbit is caught by a\r\nstoat. Cattle and horses suffer great pain in silence; but when this is\r\nexcessive, and especially when associated with terror, they utter\r\nfearful sounds. I have often recognized, from a distance on the Pampas,\r\nthe agonized death-bellow of the cattle, when caught by the lasso and\r\nhamstrung. It is said that horses, when attacked by wolves, utter loud\r\nand peculiar screams of distress.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary and purposeless contractions of the muscles of the chest\r\nand glottis, excited in the above manner, may have first given rise to\r\nthe emission of vocal sounds. But the voice is now largely used by many\r\nanimals for various purposes; and habit seems to have played an\r\nimportant part in its employment under other circumstances. Naturalists\r\nhave remarked, I believe with truth, that social animals, from\r\nhabitually using their vocal organs as a means of intercommunication,\r\nuse them on other occasions much more freely than other animals. But\r\nthere are marked exceptions to this rule, for instance, with the\r\nrabbit. The principle, also, of association, which is so widely\r\nextended in its power, has likewise played its part. Hence it follows\r\nthat the voice, from having been habitually employed as a serviceable\r\naid under certain conditions, inducing pleasure, pain, rage, &c., is\r\ncommonly used whenever the same sensations or emotions are excited,\r\nunder quite different conditions, or in a lesser degree.\r\n\r\nThe sexes of many animals incessantly call for each other during the\r\nbreeding-season; and in not a few cases, the male endeavours thus to\r\ncharm or excite the female. This, indeed, seems to have been the\r\nprimeval use and means of development of the voice, as I have attempted\r\nto show in my ‘Descent of Man.’ Thus the use of the vocal organs will\r\nhave become associated with the anticipation of the strongest pleasure\r\nwhich animals are capable of feeling. Animals which live in society\r\noften call to each other when separated, and evidently feel much joy at\r\nmeeting; as we see with a horse, on the return of his companion, for\r\nwhom he has been neighing. The mother calls incessantly for her lost\r\nyoung ones; for instance, a cow for her calf; and the young of many\r\nanimals call for their mothers. When a flock of sheep is scattered, the\r\newes bleat incessantly for their lambs, and their mutual pleasure at\r\ncoming together is manifest. Woe betide the man who meddles with the\r\nyoung of the larger and fiercer quadrupeds, if they hear the cry of\r\ndistress from their young. Rage leads to the violent exertion of all\r\nthe muscles, including those of the voice; and some animals, when\r\nenraged, endeavour to strike terror into their enemies by its power and\r\nharshness, as the lion does by roaring, and the dog by growling. I\r\ninfer that their object is to strike terror, because the lion at the\r\nsame time erects the hair of its mane, and the dog the hair along its\r\nback, and thus they make themselves appear as large and terrible as\r\npossible. Rival males try to excel and challenge each other by their\r\nvoices, and this leads to deadly contests. Thus the use of the voice\r\nwill have become associated with the emotion of anger, however it may\r\nbe aroused. We have also seen that intense pain, like rage, leads to\r\nviolent outcries, and the exertion of screaming by itself gives some\r\nrelief; and thus the use of the voice will have become associated with\r\nsuffering of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe cause of widely different sounds being uttered under different\r\nemotions and sensations is a very obscure subject. Nor does the rule\r\nalways hold good that there is any marked difference. For instance with\r\nthe dog, the bark of anger and that of joy do not differ much, though\r\nthey can be distinguished. It is not probable that any precise\r\nexplanation of the cause or source of each particular sound, under\r\ndifferent states of the mind, will ever be given. We know that some\r\nanimals, after being domesticated, have acquired the habit of uttering\r\nsounds which were not natural to them.[401] Thus domestic dogs, and\r\neven tamed jackals, have learnt to bark, which is a noise not proper to\r\nany species of the genus, with the exception of the _Canis latrans_ of\r\nNorth America, which is said to bark. Some breeds, also, of the\r\ndomestic pigeon have learnt to coo in a new and quite peculiar manner.\r\n\r\nThe character of the human voice, under the influence of various\r\nemotions, has been discussed by Mr. Herbert Spencer[402] in his\r\ninteresting essay on Music. He clearly shows that the voice alters much\r\nunder different conditions, in loudness and in quality, that is, in\r\nresonance and _timbre_, in pitch and intervals. No one can listen to an\r\neloquent orator or preacher, or to a man calling angrily to another, or\r\nto one expressing astonishment, without being struck with the truth of\r\nMr. Spencer’s remarks. It is curious how early in life the modulation\r\nof the voice becomes expressive. With one of my children, under the age\r\nof two years, I clearly perceived that his humph of assent was rendered\r\nby a slight modulation strongly emphatic; and that by a peculiar whine\r\nhis negative expressed obstinate determination. Mr. Spencer further\r\nshows that emotional speech, in all the above respects is intimately\r\nrelated to vocal music, and consequently to instrumental music; and he\r\nattempts to explain the characteristic qualities of both on\r\nphysiological grounds—namely, on “the general law that a feeling is a\r\nstimulus to muscular action.” It may be admitted that the voice is\r\naffected through this law; but the explanation appears to me too\r\ngeneral and vague to throw much light on the various differences, with\r\nthe exception of that of loudness, between ordinary speech and\r\nemotional speech, or singing.\r\n\r\nThis remark holds good, whether we believe that the various qualities\r\nof the voice originated in speaking under the excitement of strong\r\nfeelings, and that these qualities have subsequently been transferred\r\nto vocal music; or whether we believe, as I maintain, that the habit of\r\nuttering musical sounds was first developed, as a means of courtship,\r\nin the early progenitors of man, and thus became associated with the\r\nstrongest emotions of which they were capable,—namely, ardent love,\r\nrivalry and triumph. That animals utter musical notes is familiar to\r\nevery one, as we may daily hear in the singing of birds. It is a more\r\nremarkable fact that an ape, one of the Gibbons, produces an exact\r\noctave of musical sounds, ascending and descending the scale by\r\nhalftones; so that this monkey “alone of brute mammals may be said to\r\nsing.”[403] From this fact, and from the analogy of other animals, I\r\nhave been led to infer that the progenitors of man probably uttered\r\nmusical tones, before they had acquired the power of articulate speech;\r\nand that consequently, when the voice is used under any strong emotion,\r\nit tends to assume, through the principle of association, a musical\r\ncharacter. We can plainly perceive, with some of the lower animals,\r\nthat the males employ their voices to please the females, and that they\r\nthemselves take pleasure in their own vocal utterances; but why\r\nparticular sounds are uttered, and why these give pleasure cannot at\r\npresent be explained.\r\n\r\nThat the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states of\r\nfeeling is tolerably clear. A person gently complaining of\r\nill-treatment, or slightly suffering, almost always speaks in a\r\nhigh-pitched voice. Dogs, when a little impatient, often make a high\r\npiping note through their noses, which at once strikes us as\r\nplaintive;[404] but how difficult it is to know whether the sound is\r\nessentially plaintive, or only appears so in this particular case, from\r\nour having learnt by experience what it means! Rengger, states[405]\r\nthat the monkeys (_Cebus azaræ_), which he kept in Paraguay, expressed\r\nastonishment by a half-piping, half-snarling noise; anger or\r\nimpatience, by repeating the sound _hu hu_ in a deeper, grunting voice;\r\nand fright or pain, by shrill screams. On the other hand, with mankind,\r\ndeep groans and high piercing screams equally express an agony of pain.\r\nLaughter maybe either high or low; so that, with adult men, as Haller\r\nlong ago remarked,[406] the sound partakes of the character of the\r\nvowels (as pronounced in German) _O_ and _A_; whilst with children and\r\nwomen, it has more of the character of _E_ and _I_; and these latter\r\nvowel-sounds naturally have, as Helmholtz has shown, a higher pitch\r\nthan the former; yet both tones of laughter equally express enjoyment\r\nor amusement.\r\n\r\nIn considering the mode in which vocal utterances express emotion, we\r\nare naturally led to inquire into the cause of what is called\r\n“expression” in music. Upon this point Mr. Litchfield, who has long\r\nattended to the subject of music, has been so kind as to give me the\r\nfollowing remarks:—“The question, what is the essence of musical\r\n‘expression’ involves a number of obscure points, which, so far as I am\r\naware, are as yet unsolved enigmas. Up to a certain point, however, any\r\nlaw which is found to hold as to the expression of the emotions by\r\nsimple sounds must apply to the more developed mode of expression in\r\nsong, which may be taken as the primary type of all music. A great part\r\nof the emotional effect of a song depends on the character of the\r\naction by which the sounds are produced. In songs, for instance, which\r\nexpress great vehemence of passion, the effect often chiefly depends on\r\nthe forcible utterance of some one or two characteristic passages which\r\ndemand great exertion of vocal force; and it will be frequently noticed\r\nthat a song of this character fails of its proper effect when sung by a\r\nvoice of sufficient power and range to give the characteristic passages\r\nwithout much exertion. This is, no doubt, the secret of the loss of\r\neffect so often produced by the transposition of a song from one key to\r\nanother. The effect is thus seen to depend not merely on the actual\r\nsounds, but also in part on the nature of the action which produces the\r\nsounds. Indeed it is obvious that whenever we feel the ‘expression’ of\r\na song to be due to its quickness or slowness of movement—to smoothness\r\nof flow, loudness of utterance, and so on—we are, in fact, interpreting\r\nthe muscular actions which produce sound, in the same way in which we\r\ninterpret muscular action generally. But this leaves unexplained the\r\nmore subtle and more specific effect which we call the _musical_\r\nexpression of the song—the delight given by its melody, or even by the\r\nseparate sounds which make up the melody. This is an effect indefinable\r\nin language—one which, so far as I am aware, no one has been able to\r\nanalyse, and which the ingenious speculation of Mr. Herbert Spencer as\r\nto the origin of music leaves quite unexplained. For it is certain that\r\nthe _melodic_ effect of a series of sounds does not depend in the least\r\non their loudness or softness, or on their _absolute_ pitch. A tune is\r\nalways the same tune, whether it is sung loudly or softly, by a child\r\nor a man; whether it is played on a flute or on a trombone. The purely\r\nmusical effect of any sound depends on its place in what is technically\r\ncalled a ‘scale;’ the same sound producing absolutely different effects\r\non the ear, according as it is heard in connection with one or another\r\nseries of sounds.\r\n\r\n“It is on this _relative_ association of the sounds that all the\r\nessentially characteristic effects which are summed up in the phrase\r\n‘musical expression,’ depend. But why certain associations of sounds\r\nhave such-and-such effects, is a problem which yet remains to be\r\nsolved. These effects must indeed, in some way or other, be connected\r\nwith the well-known arithmetical relations between the rates of\r\nvibration of the sounds which form a musical scale. And it is\r\npossible—but this is merely a suggestion—that the greater or less\r\nmechanical facility with which the vibrating apparatus of the human\r\nlarynx passes from one state of vibration to another, may have been a\r\nprimary cause of the greater or less pleasure produced by various\r\nsequences of sounds.”\r\n\r\nBut leaving aside these complex questions and confining ourselves to\r\nthe simpler sounds, we can, at least, see some reasons for the\r\nassociation of certain kinds of sounds with certain states of mind. A\r\nscream, for instance, uttered by a young animal, or by one of the\r\nmembers of a community, as a call for assistance, will naturally be\r\nloud, prolonged, and high, so as to penetrate to a distance. For\r\nHelmholtz has shown[407] that, owing to the shape of the internal\r\ncavity of the human ear and its consequent power of resonance, high\r\nnotes produce a particularly strong impression. When male animals utter\r\nsounds in order to please the females, they would naturally employ\r\nthose which are sweet to the ears of the species; and it appears that\r\nthe same sounds are often pleasing to widely different animals, owing\r\nto the similarity of their nervous systems, as we ourselves perceive in\r\nthe singing of birds and even in the chirping of certain tree-frogs\r\ngiving us pleasure. On the other hand, sounds produced in order to\r\nstrike terror into an enemy, would naturally be harsh or displeasing.\r\n\r\nWhether the principle of antithesis has come into play with sounds, as\r\nmight perhaps have been expected, is doubtful. The interrupted,\r\nlaughing or tittering sounds made by man and by various kinds of\r\nmonkeys when pleased, are as different as possible from the prolonged\r\nscreams of these animals when distressed. The deep grunt of\r\nsatisfaction uttered by a pig, when pleased with its food, is widely\r\ndifferent from its harsh scream of pain or terror. But with the dog, as\r\nlately remarked, the bark of anger and that of joy are sounds which by\r\nno means stand in opposition to each other; and so it is in some other\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThere is another obscure point, namely, whether the sounds which are\r\nproduced under various states of the mind determine the shape of the\r\nmouth, or whether its shape is not determined by independent causes,\r\nand the sound thus modified. When young infants cry they open their\r\nmouths widely, and this, no doubt, is necessary for pouring forth a\r\nfull volume of sound; but the mouth then assumes, from a quite distinct\r\ncause, an almost quadrangular shape, depending, as will hereafter be\r\nexplained, on the firm closing of the eyelids, and consequent drawing\r\nup of the upper lip. How far this square shape of the mouth modifies\r\nthe wailing or crying sound, I am not prepared to say; but we know from\r\nthe researches of Helmholtz and others that the form of the cavity of\r\nthe mouth and lips determines the nature and pitch of the vowel sounds\r\nwhich are produced.\r\n\r\nIt will also be shown in a future chapter that, under the feeling of\r\ncontempt or disgust, there is a tendency, from intelligible causes, to\r\nblow out of the mouth or nostrils, and this produces sounds like pooh\r\nor pish. When any one is startled or suddenly astonished, there is an\r\ninstantaneous tendency, likewise from an intelligible cause, namely, to\r\nbe ready for prolonged exertion, to open the mouth widely, so as to\r\ndraw a deep and rapid inspiration. When the next full expiration\r\nfollows, the mouth is slightly closed, and the lips, from causes\r\nhereafter to be discussed, are somewhat protruded; and this form of the\r\nmouth, if the voice be at all exerted, produces, according to\r\nHelmholtz, the sound of the vowel _O_. Certainly a deep sound of a\r\nprolonged _Oh!_ may be heard from a whole crowd of people immediately\r\nafter witnessing any astonishing spectacle. If, together with surprise,\r\npain be felt, there is a tendency to contract all the muscles of the\r\nbody, including those of the face, and the lips will then be drawn\r\nback; and this will perhaps account for the sound becoming higher and\r\nassuming the character of _Ah!_ or _Ach!_ As fear causes all the\r\nmuscles of the body to tremble, the voice naturally becomes tremulous,\r\nand at the same time husky from the dryness of the mouth, owing to the\r\nsalivary glands failing to act. Why the laughter of man and the\r\ntittering of monkeys should be a rapidly reiterated sound, cannot be\r\nexplained. During the utterance of these sounds, the mouth is\r\ntransversely elongated by the corners being drawn backwards and\r\nupwards; and of this fact an explanation will be attempted in a future\r\nchapter. But the whole subject of the differences of the sounds\r\nproduced under different states of the mind is so obscure, that I have\r\nsucceeded in throwing hardly any light on it; and the remarks which I\r\nhave made, have but little significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSound Producing Quills from Tail of a Porcupine. Fig. 11\r\n\r\nAll the sounds hitherto noticed depend on the respiratory organs; but\r\nsounds produced by wholly different means are likewise expressive.\r\nRabbits stamp loudly on the ground as a signal to their comrades; and\r\nif a man knows how to do so properly, he may on a quiet evening hear\r\nthe rabbits answering him all around. These animals, as well as some\r\nothers, also stamp on the ground when made angry. Porcupines rattle\r\ntheir quills and vibrate their tails when angered; and one behaved in\r\nthis manner when a live snake was placed in its compartment. The quills\r\non the tail are very different from those on the body: they are short,\r\nhollow, thin like a goose-quill, with their ends transversely\r\ntruncated, so that they are open; they are supported on long, thin,\r\nelastic foot-stalks. Now, when the tail is rapidly shaken, these hollow\r\nquills strike against each other and produce, as I heard in the\r\npresence of Mr. Bartlett, a peculiar continuous sound. We can, I think,\r\nunderstand why porcupines have been provided, through the modification\r\nof their protective spines, with this special sound-producing\r\ninstrument. They are nocturnal animals, and if they scented or heard a\r\nprowling beast of prey, it would be a great advantage to them in the\r\ndark to give warning to their enemy what they were, and that they were\r\nfurnished with dangerous spines. They would thus escape being attacked.\r\nThey are, as I may add, so fully conscious of the power of their\r\nweapons, that when enraged they will charge backwards with their spines\r\nerected, yet still inclined backwards.\r\n\r\nMany birds during their courtship produce diversified sounds by means\r\nof specially adapted feathers. Storks, when excited, make a loud\r\nclattering noise with their beaks. Some snakes produce a grating or\r\nrattling noise. Many insects stridulate by rubbing together specially\r\nmodified parts of their hard integuments. This stridulation generally\r\nserves as a sexual charm or call; but it is likewise used to express\r\ndifferent emotions.[408] Every one who has attended to bees knows that\r\ntheir humming changes when they are angry; and this serves as a warning\r\nthat there is danger of being stung. I have made these few remarks\r\nbecause some writers have laid so much stress on the vocal and\r\nrespiratory organs as having been specially adapted for expression,\r\nthat it was advisable to show that sounds otherwise produced serve\r\nequally well for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n_Erection of the dermal appendages_.—Hardly any expressive movement is\r\nso general as the involuntary erection of the hairs, feathers and other\r\ndermal appendages; for it is common throughout three of the great\r\nvertebrate classes. These appendages are erected under the excitement\r\nof anger or terror; more especially when these emotions are combined,\r\nor quickly succeed each other. The action serves to make the animal\r\nappear larger and more frightful to its enemies or rivals, and is\r\ngenerally accompanied by various voluntary movements adapted for the\r\nsame purpose, and by the utterance of savage sounds. Mr. Bartlett, who\r\nhas had such wide experience with animals of all kinds, does not doubt\r\nthat this is the case; but it is a different question whether the power\r\nof erection was primarily acquired for this special purpose.\r\n\r\nI will first give a considerable body of facts showing how general this\r\naction is with mammals, birds and reptiles; retaining what I have to\r\nsay in regard to man for a future chapter. Mr. Sutton, the intelligent\r\nkeeper in the Zoological Gardens, carefully observed for me the\r\nChimpanzee and Orang; and he states that when they are suddenly\r\nfrightened, as by a thunderstorm, or when they are made angry, as by\r\nbeing teased, their hair becomes erect. I saw a chimpanzee who was\r\nalarmed at the sight of a black coalheaver, and the hair rose all over\r\nhis body; he made little starts forward as if to attack the man,\r\nwithout any real intention of doing so, but with the hope, as the\r\nkeeper remarked, of frightening him. The Gorilla, when enraged, is\r\ndescribed by Mr. Ford[409] as having his crest of hair “erect and\r\nprojecting forward, his nostrils dilated, and his under lip thrown\r\ndown; at the same time uttering his characteristic yell, designed, it\r\nwould seem, to terrify his antagonists.” I saw the hair on the Anubis\r\nbaboon, when angered bristling along the back, from the neck to the\r\nloins, but not on the rump or other parts of the body. I took a stuffed\r\nsnake into the monkey-house, and the hair on several of the species\r\ninstantly became erect; especially on their tails, as I particularly\r\nnoticed with the _Cereopithecus nictitans_. Brehm states[410] that the\r\n_Midas œdipus_ (belonging to the American division) when excited erects\r\nits mane, in order, as he adds, to make itself as frightful as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWith the Carnivora the erection of the hair seems to be almost\r\nuniversal, often accompanied by threatening movements, the uncovering\r\nof the teeth and the utterance of savage growls. In the Herpestes, I\r\nhave seen the hair on end over nearly the whole body, including the\r\ntail; and the dorsal crest is erected in a conspicuous manner by the\r\nHyaena and Proteles. The enraged lion erects his mane. The bristling of\r\nthe hair along the neck and back of the dog, and over the whole body of\r\nthe cat, especially on the tail, is familiar to every one. With the cat\r\nit apparently occurs only under fear; with the dog, under anger and\r\nfear; but not, as far as I have observed, under abject fear, as when a\r\ndog is going to be flogged by a severe gamekeeper. If, however, the dog\r\nshows fight, as sometimes happens, up goes his hair. I have often\r\nnoticed that the hair of a dog is particularly liable to rise, if he is\r\nhalf angry and half afraid, as on beholding some object only\r\nindistinctly seen in the dusk.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by a veterinary surgeon that he has often seen the\r\nhair erected on horses and cattle, on which he had operated and was\r\nagain going to operate. When I showed a stuffed snake to a Peccary, the\r\nhair rose in a wonderful manner along its back; and so it does with the\r\nboar when enraged. An Elk which gored a man to death in the United\r\nStates, is described as first brandishing his antlers, squealing with\r\nrage and stamping on the ground; “at length his hair was seen to rise\r\nand stand on end,” and then he plunged forward to the attack.[411] The\r\nhair likewise becomes erect on goats, and, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, on\r\nsome Indian antelopes. I have seen it erected on the hairy Ant-eater;\r\nand on the Agouti, one of the Rodents. A female Bat,[412] which reared\r\nher young under confinement, when any one looked into the cage “erected\r\nthe fur on her back, and bit viciously at intruding fingers.”\r\n\r\nBirds belonging to all the chief Orders ruffle their feathers when\r\nangry or frightened. Every one must have seen two cocks, even quite\r\nyoung birds, preparing to fight with erected neck-hackles; nor can\r\nthese feathers when erected serve as a means of defence, for\r\ncock-fighters have found by experience that it is advantageous to trim\r\nthem. The male Ruff (_Machetes pugnæ_) likewise erects its collar of\r\nfeathers when fighting. When a dog approaches a common hen with her\r\nchickens, she spreads out her wings, raises her tail, ruffles all her\r\nfeathers, and looking as ferocious as possible, dashes at the intruder.\r\nThe tail is not always held in exactly the same position; it is\r\nsometimes so much erected, that the central feathers, as in the\r\naccompanying drawing, almost touch the back. Swans, when angered,\r\nlikewise raise their wings and tail, and erect their feathers. They\r\nopen their beaks, and make by paddling little rapid starts forwards,\r\nagainst any one who approaches the water’s edge too closely. Tropic\r\nbirds[413] when disturbed on their nests are said not to fly away, but\r\n“merely to stick out their feathers and scream.” The Barn-owl, when\r\napproached “instantly swells out its plumage, extends its wings and\r\ntail, hisses and clacks its mandibles with force and rapidity.”[414] So\r\ndo other kinds of owls. Hawks, as I am informed by Mr. Jenner Weir,\r\nlikewise ruffle their feathers, and spread out their wings and tail\r\nunder similar circumstances. Some kinds of parrots erect their\r\nfeathers; and I have seen this action in the Cassowary, when angered at\r\nthe sight of an Ant-eater. Young cuckoos in the nest, raise their\r\nfeathers, open their mouths widely, and make themselves as frightful as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHen Driving Away a Dog from Her Chickens. Fig. 12\r\n\r\n{illust. caption = FIG. 12—Hen driving away a dog from her chickens.\r\nDrawn from life by Mr. Wood.}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwan Driving Away an Intruder. Fig 13\r\n\r\n{illust. caption = FIG. 13.—Swan driving away an intruder. Drawn from\r\nlife by Mr. Wood.}\r\n\r\nSmall birds, also, as I hear from Mr. Weir, such as various finches,\r\nbuntings and warblers, when angry, ruffle all their feathers, or only\r\nthose round the neck; or they spread out their wings and tail-feathers.\r\nWith their plumage in this state, they rush at each other with open\r\nbeaks and threatening gestures. Mr. Weir concludes from his large\r\nexperience that the erection of the feathers is caused much more by\r\nanger than by fear. He gives as an instance a hybrid goldfinch of a\r\nmost irascible disposition, which when approached too closely by a\r\nservant, instantly assumes the appearance of a ball of ruffled\r\nfeathers. He believes that birds when frightened, as a general rule,\r\nclosely adpress all their feathers, and their consequently diminished\r\nsize is often astonishing. As soon as they recover from their fear or\r\nsurprise, the first thing which they do is to shake out their feathers.\r\nThe best instances of this adpression of the feathers and apparent\r\nshrinking of the body from fear, which Mr. Weir has noticed, has been\r\nin the quail and grass-parrakeet.[415] The habit is intelligible in\r\nthese birds from their being accustomed, when in danger, either to\r\nsquat on the ground or to sit motionless on a branch, so as to escape\r\ndetection. Though, with birds, anger may be the chief and commonest\r\ncause of the erection of the feathers, it is probable that young\r\ncuckoos when looked at in the nest, and a hen with her chickens when\r\napproached by a dog, feel at least some terror. Mr. Tegetmeier informs\r\nme that with game-cocks, the erection of the feathers on the head has\r\nlong been recognized in the cock-pit as a sign of cowardice.\r\n\r\nThe males of some lizards, when fighting together during their\r\ncourtship, expand their throat pouches or frills, and erect their\r\ndorsal crests.[416] But Dr. Günther does not believe that they can\r\nerect their separate spines or scales.\r\n\r\nWe thus see how generally throughout the two higher vertebrate classes,\r\nand with some reptiles, the dermal appendages are erected under the\r\ninfluence of anger and fear. The movement is effected, as we know from\r\nKolliker’s interesting discovery, by the contraction of minute,\r\nunstriped, involuntary muscles,[417] often called _arrectores pili_,\r\nwhich are attached to the capsules of the separate hairs, feathers, &c.\r\nBy the contraction of these muscles the hairs can be instantly erected,\r\nas we see in a dog, being at the same time drawn a little out of their\r\nsockets; they are afterwards quickly depressed. The vast number of\r\nthese minute muscles over the whole body of a hairy quadruped is\r\nastonishing. The erection of the hair is, however, aided in some cases,\r\nas with that on the head of a man, by the striped and voluntary muscles\r\nof the underlying _panniculus carnosus_. It is by the action of these\r\nlatter muscles, that the hedgehog erects its spines. It appears, also,\r\nfrom the researches of Leydig[418] and others, that striped fibres\r\nextend from the panniculus to some of the larger hairs, such as the\r\nvibrissae of certain quadrupeds. The _arrectores pili_ contract not\r\nonly under the above emotions, but from the application of cold to the\r\nsurface. I remember that my mules and dogs, brought from a lower and\r\nwarmer country, after spending a night on the bleak Cordillera, had the\r\nhair all over their bodies as erect as under the greatest terror. We\r\nsee the same action in our own _goose-skin_ during the chill before a\r\nfever-fit. Mr. Lister has also found,[419] that tickling a neighbouring\r\npart of the skin causes the erection and protrusion of the hairs.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is manifest that the erection of the dermal\r\nappendages is a reflex action, independent of the will; and this action\r\nmust be looked at, when, occurring under the influence of anger or\r\nfear, not as a power acquired for the sake of some advantage, but as an\r\nincidental result, at least to a large extent, of the sensorium being\r\naffected. The result, in as far as it is incidental, may be compared\r\nwith the profuse sweating from an agony of pain or terror.\r\nNevertheless, it is remarkable how slight an excitement often suffices\r\nto cause the hair to become erect; as when two dogs pretend to fight\r\ntogether in play. We have, also, seen in a large number of animals,\r\nbelonging to widely distinct classes, that the erection of the hair or\r\nfeathers is almost always accompanied by various voluntary movements—by\r\nthreatening gestures, opening the mouth, uncovering the teeth,\r\nspreading out of the wings and tail by birds, and by the utterance of\r\nharsh sounds; and the purpose of these voluntary movements is\r\nunmistakable. Therefore it seems hardly credible that the co-ordinated\r\nerection of the dermal appendages, by which the animal is made to\r\nappear larger and more terrible to its enemies or rivals, should be\r\naltogether an incidental and purposeless result of the disturbance of\r\nthe sensorium. This seems almost as incredible as that the erection by\r\nthe hedgehog of its spines, or of the quills by the porcupine, or of\r\nthe ornamental plumes by many birds during their courtship, should all\r\nbe purposeless actions.\r\n\r\nWe here encounter a great difficulty. How can the contraction of the\r\nunstriped and involuntary _arrectores pili_ have been co-ordinated with\r\nthat of various voluntary muscles for the same special purpose? If we\r\ncould believe that the arrectores primordially had been voluntary\r\nmuscles, and had since lost their stripes and become involuntary, the\r\ncase would be comparatively simple. I am not, however, aware that there\r\nis any evidence in favour of this view; although the reversed\r\ntransition would not have presented any great difficulty, as the\r\nvoluntary muscles are in an unstriped condition in the embryos of the\r\nhigher animals, and in the larvae of some crustaceans. Moreover in the\r\ndeeper layers of the skin of adult birds, the muscular network is,\r\naccording to Leydig,[420] in a transitional condition; the fibres\r\nexhibiting only indications of transverse striation.\r\n\r\nAnother explanation seems possible. We may admit that originally the\r\n_arrectores pili_ were slightly acted on in a direct manner, under the\r\ninfluence of rage and terror, by the disturbance of the nervous system;\r\nas is undoubtedly the case with our so-called _goose-skin_ before a\r\nfever-fit. Animals have been repeatedly excited by rage and terror\r\nduring many generations; and consequently the direct effects of the\r\ndisturbed nervous system on the dermal appendages will almost certainly\r\nhave been increased through habit and through the tendency of\r\nnerve-force to pass readily along accustomed channels. We shall find\r\nthis view of the force of habit strikingly confirmed in a future\r\nchapter, where it will be shown that the hair of the insane is affected\r\nin an extraordinary manner, owing to their repeated accesses of fury\r\nand terror. As soon as with animals the power of erection had thus been\r\nstrengthened or increased, they must often have seen the hairs or\r\nfeathers erected in rival and enraged males, and the bulk of their\r\nbodies thus increased. In this case it appears possible that they might\r\nhave wished to make themselves appear larger and more terrible to their\r\nenemies, by voluntarily assuming a threatening attitude and uttering\r\nharsh cries; such attitudes and utterances after a time becoming\r\nthrough habit instinctive. In this manner actions performed by the\r\ncontraction of voluntary muscles might have been combined for the same\r\nspecial purpose with those effected by involuntary muscles. It is even\r\npossible that animals, when excited and dimly conscious of some change\r\nin the state of their hair, might act on it by repeated exertions of\r\ntheir attention and will; for we have reason to believe that the will\r\nis able to influence in an obscure manner the action of some unstriped\r\nor involuntary muscles, as in the period of the peristaltic movements\r\nof the intestines, and in the contraction of the bladder. Nor must we\r\noverlook the part which variation and natural selection may have\r\nplayed; for the males which succeeded in making themselves appear the\r\nmost terrible to their rivals, or to their other enemies, if not of\r\noverwhelming power, will on an average have left more offspring to\r\ninherit their characteristic qualities, whatever these may be and\r\nhowever first acquired, than have other males.\r\n\r\n_The inflation of the body, and other means of exciting fear in an\r\nenemy_.—Certain Amphibians and Reptiles, which either have no spines to\r\nerect, or no muscles by which they can be erected, enlarge themselves\r\nwhen alarmed or angry by inhaling air. This is well known to be the\r\ncase with toads and frogs. The latter animal is made, in AEsop’s fable\r\nof the ‘Ox and the Frog,’ to blow itself up from vanity and envy until\r\nit burst. This action must have been observed during the most ancient\r\ntimes, as, according to Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood,[421] the word _toad_\r\nexpresses in all the languages of Europe the habit of swelling. It has\r\nbeen observed with some of the exotic species in the Zoological\r\nGardens; and Dr. Günther believes that it is general throughout the\r\ngroup. Judging from analogy, the primary purpose probably was to make\r\nthe body appear as large and frightful as possible to an enemy; but\r\nanother, and perhaps more important secondary advantage is thus gained.\r\nWhen frogs are seized by snakes, which are their chief enemies, they\r\nenlarge themselves wonderfully; so that if the snake be of small size,\r\nas Dr. Günther informs me, it cannot swallow the frog, which thus\r\nescapes being devoured.\r\n\r\nChameleons and some other lizards inflate themselves when angry. Thus a\r\nspecies inhabiting Oregon, the _Tapaya Douglasii_, is slow in its\r\nmovements and does not bite, but has a ferocious aspect; “when\r\nirritated it springs in a most threatening manner at anything pointed\r\nat it, at the same time opening its mouth wide and hissing audibly,\r\nafter which it inflates its body, and shows other marks of anger.”[422]\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of snakes likewise inflate themselves when irritated. The\r\npuff-adder (_Clotho arietans_) is remarkable in this respect; but I\r\nbelieve, after carefully watching these animals, that they do not act\r\nthus for the sake of increasing their apparent bulk, but simply for\r\ninhaling a large supply of air, so as to produce their surprisingly\r\nloud, harsh, and prolonged hissing sound. The Cobras-de-capello, when\r\nirritated, enlarge themselves a little, and hiss moderately; but, at\r\nthe same time they lift their heads aloft, and dilate by means of their\r\nelongated anterior ribs, the skin on each side of the neck into a large\r\nflat disk,—the so-called hood. With their widely opened mouths, they\r\nthen assume a terrific aspect. The benefit thus derived ought to be\r\nconsiderable, in order to compensate for the somewhat lessened rapidity\r\n(though this is still great) with which, when dilated, they can strike\r\nat their enemies or prey; on the same principle that a broad, thin\r\npiece of wood cannot be moved through the air so quickly as a small\r\nround stick. An innocuous snake, the _Trovidonotus macrophthalmus_, an\r\ninhabitant of India, likewise dilates its neck when irritated; and\r\nconsequently is often mistaken for its compatriot, the deadly\r\nCobra.[423] This resemblance perhaps serves as some protection to the\r\nTropidonotus. Another innocuous species, the Dasypeltis of South\r\nAfrica, blows itself out, distends its neck, hisses and darts at an\r\nintruder.[424] Many other snakes hiss under similar circumstances. They\r\nalso rapidly vibrate their protruded tongues; and this may aid in\r\nincreasing their terrific appearance.\r\n\r\nSnakes possess other means of producing sounds besides hissing. Many\r\nyears ago I observed in South America that a venomous Trigonocephalus,\r\nwhen disturbed, rapidly vibrated the end of its tail, which striking\r\nagainst the dry grass and twigs produced a rattling noise that could be\r\ndistinctly heard at the distance of six feet.[425] The deadly and\r\nfierce _Echis carinata_ of India produces “a curious prolonged, almost\r\nhissing sound in a very different manner, namely by rubbing the sides\r\nof the folds of its body against each other,” whilst the head remains\r\nin almost the same position. The scales on the sides, and not on other\r\nparts of the body, are strongly keeled, with the keels toothed like a\r\nsaw; and as the coiled-up animal rubs its sides together, these grate\r\nagainst each other.[426] Lastly, we have the well-known case of the\r\nRattle-snake. He who has merely shaken the rattle of a dead snake, can\r\nform no just idea of the sound produced by the living animal. Professor\r\nShaler states that it is indistinguishable from that made by the male\r\nof a large Cicada (an Homopterous insect), which inhabits the same\r\ndistrict.[427] In the Zoological Gardens, when the rattle-snakes and\r\npuff-adders were greatly excited at the same time, I was much struck at\r\nthe similarity of the sound produced by them; and although that made by\r\nthe rattle-snake is louder and shriller than the hissing of the\r\npuff-adder, yet when standing at some yards distance I could scarcely\r\ndistinguish the two. For whatever purpose the sound is produced by the\r\none species, I can hardly doubt that it serves for the same purpose in\r\nthe other species; and I conclude from the threatening gestures made at\r\nthe same time by many snakes, that their hissing,—the rattling of the\r\nrattle-snake and of the tail of the Trigonocephalus,—the grating of the\r\nscales of the Echis,—and the dilatation of the hood of the Cobra,—all\r\nsubserve the same end, namely, to make them appear terrible to their\r\nenemies.[428]\r\n\r\nIt seems at first a probable conclusion that venomous snakes, such as\r\nthe foregoing, from being already so well defended by their\r\npoison-fangs, would never be attacked by any enemy; and consequently\r\nwould have no need to excite additional terror. But this is far from\r\nbeing the case, for they are largely preyed on in all quarters of the\r\nworld by many animals. It is well known that pigs are employed in the\r\nUnited States to clear districts infested with rattle-snakes, which\r\nthey do most effectually.[429] In England the hedgehog attacks and\r\ndevours the viper. In India, as I hear from Dr. Jerdon, several kinds\r\nof hawks, and at least one mammal, the Herpestes, kill cobras and other\r\nvenomous species;[430] and so it is in South Africa. Therefore it is by\r\nno means improbable that any sounds or signs by which the venomous\r\nspecies could instantly make themselves recognized as dangerous, would\r\nbe of more service to them than to the innocuous species which would\r\nnot be able, if attacked, to inflict any real injury.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much about snakes, I am tempted to add a few remarks\r\non the means by which the rattle of the rattle-snake was probably\r\ndeveloped. Various animals, including some lizards, either curl or\r\nvibrate their tails when excited. This is the case with many kinds of\r\nsnakes.[431] In the Zoological Gardens, an innocuous species, the\r\n_Coronella Sayi_, vibrates its tail so rapidly that it becomes almost\r\ninvisible. The Trigonocephalus, before alluded to, has the same habit;\r\nand the extremity of its tail is a little enlarged, or ends in a bead.\r\nIn the Lachesis, which is so closely allied to the rattle-snake that it\r\nwas placed by Linnaeus in the same genus, the tail ends in a single,\r\nlarge, lancet-shaped point or scale. With some snakes the skin, as\r\nProfessor Shaler remarks, “is more imperfectly detached from the region\r\nabout the tail than at other parts of the body.” Now if we suppose that\r\nthe end of the tail of some ancient American species was enlarged, and\r\nwas covered by a single large scale, this could hardly have been cast\r\noff at the successive moults. In this case it would have been\r\npermanently retained, and at each period of growth, as the snake grew\r\nlarger, a new scale, larger than the last, would have been formed above\r\nit, and would likewise have been retained. The foundation for the\r\ndevelopment of a rattle would thus have been laid; and it would have\r\nbeen habitually used, if the species, like so many others, vibrated its\r\ntail whenever it was irritated. That the rattle has since been\r\nspecially developed to serve as an efficient sound-producing\r\ninstrument, there can hardly be a doubt; for even the vertebrae\r\nincluded within the extremity of the tail have been altered in shape\r\nand cohere. But there is no greater improbability in various\r\nstructures, such as the rattle of the rattle-snake,—the lateral scales\r\nof the Echis,—the neck with the included ribs of the Cobra,—and the\r\nwhole body of the puff-adder,—having been modified for the sake of\r\nwarning and frightening away their enemies, than in a bird, namely, the\r\nwonderful Secretary-hawk (_Gypogeranus_) having had its whole frame\r\nmodified for the sake of killing snakes with impunity. It is highly\r\nprobable, judging from what we have before seen, that this bird would\r\nruffle its feathers whenever it attacked a snake; and it is certain\r\nthat the Herpestes, when it eagerly rushes to attack a snake, erects\r\nthe hair all over its body, and especially that on its tail.[432] We\r\nhave also seen that some porcupines, when angered or alarmed at the\r\nsight of a snake, rapidly vibrate their tails, thus producing a\r\npeculiar sound by the striking together of the hollow quills. So that\r\nhere both the attackers and the attacked endeavour to make themselves\r\nas dreadful as possible to each other; and both possess for this\r\npurpose specialised means, which, oddly enough, are nearly the same in\r\nsome of these cases. Finally we can see that if, on the one hand, those\r\nindividual snakes, which were best able to frighten away their enemies,\r\nescaped best from being devoured; and if, on the other hand, those\r\nindividuals of the attacking enemy survived in larger numbers which\r\nwere the best fitted for the dangerous task of killing and devouring\r\nvenomous snakes;—then in the one case as in the other, beneficial\r\nvariations, supposing the characters in question to vary, would\r\ncommonly have been preserved through the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\n_The Drawing back and pressure of the Ears to the Head_.—The ears\r\nthrough their movements are highly expressive in many animals; but in\r\nsome, such as man, the higher apes, and many ruminants, they fail in\r\nthis respect. A slight difference in position serves to express in the\r\nplainest manner a different state of mind, as we may daily see in the\r\ndog; but we are here concerned only with the ears being drawn closely\r\nbackwards and pressed to the head. A savage frame of mind is thus\r\nshown, but only in the case of those animals which fight with their\r\nteeth; and the care which they take to prevent their ears being seized\r\nby their antagonists, accounts for this position. Consequently, through\r\nhabit and association, whenever they feel slightly savage, or pretend\r\nin their play to be savage, their ears are drawn back. That this is the\r\ntrue explanation may be inferred from the relation which exists in very\r\nmany animals between their manner of fighting and the retraction of\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\nAll the Carnivora fight with their canine teeth, and all, as far as I\r\nhave observed, draw their ears back when feeling savage. This may be\r\ncontinually seen with dogs when fighting in earnest, and with puppies\r\nfighting in play. The movement is different from the falling down and\r\nslight drawing back of the ears, when a dog feels pleased and is\r\ncaressed by his master. The retraction of the ears may likewise be seen\r\nin kittens fighting together in their play, and in full-grown cats when\r\nreally savage, as before illustrated in fig. 9 (p. 58). Although their\r\nears are thus to a large extent protected, yet they often get much torn\r\nin old male cats during their mutual battles. The same movement is very\r\nstriking in tigers, leopards, &c., whilst growling over their food in\r\nmenageries. The lynx has remarkably long ears; and their retraction,\r\nwhen one of these animals is approached in its cage, is very\r\nconspicuous, and is eminently expressive of its savage disposition.\r\nEven one of the Eared Seals, the _Otariapusilla_, which has very small\r\nears, draws them backwards, when it makes a savage rush at the legs of\r\nits keeper.\r\n\r\nWhen horses fight together they use their incisors for biting, and\r\ntheir fore-legs for striking, much more than they do their hind-legs\r\nfor kicking backwards. This has been observed when stallions have\r\nbroken loose and have fought together, and may likewise be inferred\r\nfrom the kind of wounds which they inflict on each other. Every one\r\nrecognizes the vicious appearance which the drawing back of the ears\r\ngives to a horse. This movement is very different from that of\r\nlistening to a sound behind. If an ill-tempered horse in a stall is\r\ninclined to kick backwards, his ears are retracted from habit, though\r\nhe has no intention or power to bite. But when a horse throws up both\r\nhind-legs in play, as when entering an open field, or when just touched\r\nby the whip, he does not generally depress his ears, for he does not\r\nthen feel vicious. Guanacoes fight savagely with their teeth; and they\r\nmust do so frequently, for I found the hides of several which I shot in\r\nPatagonia deeply scored. So do camels; and both these animals, when\r\nsavage, draw their ears closely backwards. Guanacoes, as I have\r\nnoticed, when not intending to bite, but merely to spit their offensive\r\nsaliva from a distance at an intruder, retract their ears. Even the\r\nhippopotamus, when threatening with its widely-open enormous mouth a\r\ncomrade, draws back its small ears, just like a horse.\r\n\r\nNow what a contrast is presented between the foregoing animals and\r\ncattle, sheep, or goats, which never use their teeth in fighting, and\r\nnever draw back their ears when enraged! Although sheep and goats\r\nappear such placid animals, the males often join in furious contests.\r\nAs deer form a closely related family, and as I did not know that they\r\never fought with their teeth, I was much surprised at the account given\r\nby Major Ross King of the Moose-deer in Canada. He says, when“two males\r\nchance to meet, laying back their ears and gnashing their teeth\r\ntogether, they rush at each other with appalling fury.”[433] But Mr.\r\nBartlett informs me that some species of deer fight savagely with their\r\nteeth, so that the drawing back of the ears by the moose accords with\r\nour rule. Several kinds of kangaroos, kept in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nfight by scratching with their fore-feet and by kicking with their\r\nhind-legs; but they never bite each other, and the keepers have never\r\nseen them draw back their ears when angered. Rabbits fight chiefly by\r\nkicking and scratching, but they likewise bite each other; and I have\r\nknown one to bite off half the tail of its antagonist. At the\r\ncommencement of their battles they lay back their ears, but afterwards,\r\nas they bound over and kick each other, they keep their ears erect, or\r\nmove them much about.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartlett watched a wild boar quarrelling rather savagely with his\r\nsow; and both had their mouths open and their ears drawn backwards. But\r\nthis does not appear to be a common action with domestic pigs when\r\nquarrelling. Boars fight together by striking upwards with their tusks;\r\nand Mr. Bartlett doubts whether they then draw back their ears.\r\nElephants, which in like manner fight with their tusks, do not retract\r\ntheir ears, but, on the contrary, erect them when rushing at each other\r\nor at an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceroses in the Zoological Gardens fight with their nasal\r\nhorns, and have never been seen to attempt biting each other except in\r\nplay; and the keepers are convinced that they do not draw back their\r\nears, like horses and dogs, when feeling savage. The following\r\nstatement, therefore, by Sir S. Baker[434] is inexplicable, namely,\r\nthat a rhinoceros, which he shot in North Africa, “had no ears; they\r\nhad been bitten off close to the head by another of the same species\r\nwhile fighting; and this mutilation is by no means uncommon.”\r\n\r\nLastly, with respect to monkeys. Some kinds, which have moveable ears,\r\nand which fight with their teeth—for instance the _Cereopithecus\r\nruber_—draw back their ears when irritated just like dogs; and they\r\nthen have a very spiteful appearance. Other kinds, as the _Inuus\r\necaudatus_, apparently do not thus act. Again, other kinds—and this is\r\na great anomaly in comparison with most other animals—retract their\r\nears, show their teeth, and jabber, when they are pleased by being\r\ncaressed. I observed this in two or three species of Macacus, and in\r\nthe _Cynopithecus niger_. This expression, owing to our familiarity\r\nwith dogs, would never be recognized as one of joy or pleasure by those\r\nunacquainted with monkeys.\r\n\r\n_Erection of the Ears_.—This movement requires hardly any notice. All\r\nanimals which have the power of freely moving their ears, when they are\r\nstartled, or when they closely observe any object, direct their ears to\r\nthe point towards which they are looking, in order to hear any sound\r\nfrom this quarter. At the same time they generally raise their heads,\r\nas all their organs of sense are there situated, and some of the\r\nsmaller animals rise on their hind-legs. Even those kinds which squat\r\non the ground or instantly flee away to avoid danger, generally act\r\nmomentarily in this manner, in order to ascertain the source and nature\r\nof the danger. The head being raised, with erected ears and eyes\r\ndirected forwards, gives an unmistakable expression of close attention\r\nto any animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe Dog, various expressive movements of—Cats—Horses—Ruminants—Monkeys,\r\ntheir expression of joy and affection—Of pain—Anger—Astonishment and\r\nTerror.\r\n\r\n_The Dog_.—I have already described (figs. 5 and 7) the appearance of a\r\ndog approaching another dog with hostile intentions, namely, with\r\nerected ears, eyes intently directed forwards, hair on the neck and\r\nback bristling, gait remarkably stiff, with the tail upright and rigid.\r\nSo familiar is this appearance to us, that an angry man is sometimes\r\nsaid “to have his back up.” Of the above points, the stiff gait and\r\nupright tail alone require further discussion. Sir C. Bell remarks[501]\r\nthat, when a tiger or wolf is struck by its keeper and is suddenly\r\nroused to ferocity, every muscle is in tension, and the limbs are in an\r\nattitude of strained exertion, prepared to spring. This tension of the\r\nmuscles and consequent stiff gait may be accounted for on the principle\r\nof associated habit, for anger has continually led to fierce struggles,\r\nand consequently to all the muscles of the body having been violently\r\nexerted. There is also reason to suspect that the muscular system\r\nrequires some short preparation, or some degree of innervation, before\r\nbeing brought into strong action. My own sensations lead me to this\r\ninference; but I cannot discover that it is a conclusion admitted by\r\nphysiologists. Sir J. Paget, however, informs me that when muscles are\r\nsuddenly contracted with the greatest force, without any preparation,\r\nthey are liable to be ruptured, as when a man slips unexpectedly; but\r\nthat this rarely occurs when an action, however violent, is\r\ndeliberately performed.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the upright position of the tail, it seems to depend\r\n(but whether this is really the case I know not) on the elevator\r\nmuscles being more powerful than the depressors, so that when all the\r\nmuscles of the hinder part of the body are in a state of tension, the\r\ntail is raised. A dog in cheerful spirits, and trotting before his\r\nmaster with high, elastic steps, generally carries his tail aloft,\r\nthough it is not held nearly so stiffly as when he is angered. A horse\r\nwhen first turned out into an open field, may be seen to trot with long\r\nelastic strides, the head and tail being held high aloft. Even cows\r\nwhen they frisk about from pleasure, throw up their tails in a\r\nridiculous fashion. So it is with various animals in the Zoological\r\nGardens. The position of the tail, however, in certain cases, is\r\ndetermined by special circumstances; thus as soon as a horse breaks\r\ninto a gallop, at full speed, he always lowers his tail, so that as\r\nlittle resistance as possible may be offered to the air.\r\n\r\nWhen a dog is on the point of springing on his antagonist, he utters a\r\nsavage growl; the ears are pressed closely backwards, and the upper lip\r\n(fig. 14) is retracted out of the way of his teeth, especially of his\r\ncanines. These movements may be observed with dogs and puppies in their\r\nplay. But if a dog gets really savage in his play, his expression\r\nimmediately changes. This, however, is simply due to the lips and ears\r\nbeing drawn back with much greater energy. If a dog only snarls at\r\nanother, the lip is generally retracted on one side alone, namely\r\ntowards his enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHead of Snarling Dog. Fig 14\r\n\r\n{illust. caption = FIG. 14.—Head of snarling Dog. From life, by Mr.\r\nWood.\r\n\r\nThe movements of a dog whilst exhibiting affection towards his master\r\nwere described (figs. 6 and 8) in our second chapter. These consist in\r\nthe head and whole body being lowered and thrown into flexuous\r\nmovements, with the tail extended and wagged from side to side. The\r\nears fall down and are drawn somewhat backwards, which causes the\r\neyelids to be elongated, and alters the whole appearance of the face.\r\nThe lips hang loosely, and the hair remains smooth. All these movements\r\nor gestures are explicable, as I believe, from their standing in\r\ncomplete antithesis to those naturally assumed by a savage dog under a\r\ndirectly opposite state of mind. When a man merely speaks to, or just\r\nnotices, his dog, we see the last vestige of these movements in a\r\nslight wag of the tail, without any other movement of the body, and\r\nwithout even the ears being lowered. Dogs also exhibit their affection\r\nby desiring to rub against their masters, and to be rubbed or patted by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nGratiolet explains the above gestures of affection in the following\r\nmanner: and the reader can judge whether the explanation appears\r\nsatisfactory. Speaking of animals in general, including the dog, he\r\nsays,[502] “C’est toujours la partie la plus sensible de leurs corps\r\nqui recherche les caresses ou les donne. Lorsque toute la longueur des\r\nflancs et du corps est sensible, l’animal serpente et rampe sous les\r\ncaresses; et ces ondulations se propageant le long des muscles\r\nanalogues des segments jusqu’aux extrémités de la colonne vertébrale,\r\nla queue se ploie et s’agite.” Further on, he adds, that dogs, when\r\nfeeling affectionate, lower their ears in order to exclude all sounds,\r\nso that their whole attention may be concentrated on the caresses of\r\ntheir master!\r\n\r\nDogs have another and striking way of exhibiting their affection,\r\nnamely, by licking the hands or faces of their masters. They sometimes\r\nlick other dogs, and then it is always their chops. I have also seen\r\ndogs licking cats with whom they were friends. This habit probably\r\noriginated in the females carefully licking their puppies—the dearest\r\nobject of their love—for the sake of cleansing them. They also often\r\ngive their puppies, after a short absence, a few cursory licks,\r\napparently from affection. Thus the habit will have become associated\r\nwith the emotion of love, however it may afterwards be aroused. It is\r\nnow so firmly inherited or innate, that it is transmitted equally to\r\nboth sexes. A female terrier of mine lately had her puppies destroyed,\r\nand though at all times a very affectionate creature, I was much struck\r\nwith the manner in which she then tried to satisfy her instinctive\r\nmaternal love by expending it on me; and her desire to lick my hands\r\nrose to an insatiable passion.\r\n\r\nThe same principle probably explains why dogs, when feeling\r\naffectionate, like rubbing against their masters and being rubbed or\r\npatted by them, for from the nursing of their puppies, contact with a\r\nbeloved object has become firmly associated in their minds with the\r\nemotion of love.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of affection of a dog towards his master is combined with a\r\nstrong sense of submission, which is akin to fear. Hence dogs not only\r\nlower their bodies and crouch a little as they approach their masters,\r\nbut sometimes throw themselves on the ground with their bellies\r\nupwards. This is a movement as completely opposite as is possible to\r\nany show of resistance. I formerly possessed a large dog who was not at\r\nall afraid to fight with other dogs; but a wolf-like shepherd-dog in\r\nthe neighbourhood, though not ferocious and not so powerful as my dog,\r\nhad a strange influence over him. When they met on the road, my dog\r\nused to run to meet him, with his tail partly tucked in between his\r\nlegs and hair not erected; and then he would throw himself on the\r\nground, belly upwards. By this action he seemed to say more plainly\r\nthan by words, “Behold, I am your slave.”\r\n\r\nA pleasurable and excited state of mind, associated with affection, is\r\nexhibited by some dogs in a very peculiar manner, namely, by grinning.\r\nThis was noticed long ago by Somerville, who says,\r\n\r\n“And with a courtly grin, the fawning hound\r\nSalutes thee cow’ring, his wide op’ning nose\r\nUpward he curls, and his large sloe-back eyes\r\nMelt in soft blandishments, and humble joy.”\r\n_The Chase_, book i.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir W. Scott’s famous Scotch greyhound, Maida, had this habit, and it\r\nis common with terriers. I have also seen it in a Spitz and in a\r\nsheep-dog. Mr. Riviere, who has particularly attended to this\r\nexpression, informs me that it is rarely displayed in a perfect manner,\r\nbut is quite common in a lesser degree. The upper lip during the act of\r\ngrinning is retracted, as in snarling, so that the canines are exposed,\r\nand the ears are drawn backwards; but the general appearance of the\r\nanimal clearly shows that anger is not felt. Sir C. Bell[503] remarks\r\n“Dogs, in their expression of fondness, have a slight eversion of the\r\nlips, and grin and sniff amidst their gambols, in a way that resembles\r\nlaughter.” Some persons speak of the grin as a smile, but if it had\r\nbeen really a smile, we should see a similar, though more pronounced,\r\nmovement of the lips and ears, when dogs utter their bark of joy; but\r\nthis is not the case, although a bark of joy often follows a grin. On\r\nthe other hand, dogs, when playing with their comrades or masters,\r\nalmost always pretend to bite each other; and they then retract, though\r\nnot energetically, their lips and ears. Hence I suspect that there is a\r\ntendency in some dogs, whenever they feel lively pleasure combined with\r\naffection, to act through habit and association on the same muscles, as\r\nin playfully biting each other, or their masters’ hands.\r\n\r\nI have described, in the second chapter, the gait and appearance of a\r\ndog when cheerful, and the marked antithesis presented by the same\r\nanimal when dejected and disappointed, with his head, ears, body, tail,\r\nand chops drooping, and eyes dull. Under the expectation of any great\r\npleasure, dogs bound and jump about in an extravagant manner, and bark\r\nfor joy. The tendency to bark under this state of mind is inherited, or\r\nruns in the breed: greyhounds rarely bark, whilst the Spitz-dog barks\r\nso incessantly on starting for a walk with his master that he becomes a\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nAn agony of pain is expressed by dogs in nearly the same way as by many\r\nother animals, namely, by howling writhing, and contortions of the\r\nwhole body.\r\n\r\nAttention is shown by the head being raised, with the ears erected, and\r\neyes intently directed towards the object or quarter under observation.\r\nIf it be a sound and the source is not known, the head is often turned\r\nobliquely from side to side in a most significant manner, apparently in\r\norder to judge with more exactness from what point the sound proceeds.\r\nBut I have seen a dog greatly surprised at a new noise, turning, his\r\nhead to one side through habit, though he clearly perceived the source\r\nof the noise. Dogs, as formerly remarked, when their attention is in\r\nany way aroused, whilst watching some object, or attending to some\r\nsound, often lift up one paw (fig. 4) and keep it doubled up, as if to\r\nmake a slow and stealthy approach.\r\n\r\nA dog under extreme terror will throw himself down, howl, and void his\r\nexcretions; but the hair, I believe, does not become erect unless some\r\nanger is felt. I have seen a dog much terrified at a band of musicians\r\nwho were playing loudly outside the house, with every muscle of his\r\nbody trembling, with his heart palpitating so quickly that the beats\r\ncould hardly be counted, and panting for breath with widely open mouth,\r\nin the same manner as a terrified man does. Yet this dog had not\r\nexerted himself; he had only wandered slowly and restlessly about the\r\nroom, and the day was cold.\r\n\r\nEven a very slight degree of fear is invariably shown by the tail being\r\ntucked in between the legs. This tucking in of the fail is accompanied\r\nby the ears being drawn backwards; but they are not pressed closely to\r\nthe head, as in snarling, and they are not lowered, as when a dog is\r\npleased or affectionate. When two young dogs chase each other in play,\r\nthe one that runs away always keeps his tail tucked inwards. So it is\r\nwhen a dog, in the highest spirits, careers like a mad creature round\r\nand round his master in circles, or in figures of eight. He then acts\r\nas if another dog were chasing him. This curious kind of play, which\r\nmust be familiar to every one who has attended to dogs, is particularly\r\napt to be excited, after the animal has been a little startled or\r\nfrightened, as by his master suddenly jumping out on him in the dusk.\r\nIn this case, as well as when two young dogs are chasing each other in\r\nplay, it appears as if the one that runs away was afraid of the other\r\ncatching him by the tail; but as far as I can find out, dogs very\r\nrarely catch each other in this manner. I asked a gentleman, who had\r\nkept foxhounds all his life, and he applied to other experienced\r\nsportsmen, whether they had ever seen hounds thus seize a fox; but they\r\nnever had. It appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of\r\nbeing struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases\r\nhe wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters,\r\nand that from some sympathy or connection between the muscles, the tail\r\nis then drawn closely inwards.\r\n\r\nA similarly connected movement between the hind-quarters and the tail\r\nmay be observed in the hyaena. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when two of\r\nthese animals fight together, they are mutually conscious of the\r\nwonderful power of each other’s jaws, and are extremely cautious. They\r\nwell know that if one of their legs were seized, the bone would\r\ninstantly be crushed into atoms; hence they approach each other\r\nkneeling, with their legs turned as much as possible inwards, and with\r\ntheir whole bodies bowed, so as not to present any salient point; the\r\ntail at the same time being closely tucked in between the legs. In this\r\nattitude they approach each other sideways, or even partly backwards.\r\nSo again with deer, several of the species, when savage and fighting,\r\ntuck in their tails. When one horse in a field tries to bite the\r\nhind-quarters of another in play, or when a rough boy strikes a donkey\r\nfrom behind, the hind-quarters and the tail are drawn in, though it\r\ndoes not appear as if this were done merely to save the tail from being\r\ninjured. We have also seen the reverse of these movements; for when an\r\nanimal trots with high elastic steps, the tail is almost always carried\r\naloft.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, when a dog is chased and runs away, he keeps his ears\r\ndirected backwards but still open; and this is clearly done for the\r\nsake of hearing the footsteps of his pursuer. From habit the ears are\r\noften held in this same position, and the tail tucked in, when the\r\ndanger is obviously in front. I have repeatedly noticed, with a timid\r\nterrier of mine, that when she is afraid of some object in front, the\r\nnature of which she perfectly knows and does not need to reconnoitre,\r\nyet she will for a long time hold her ears and tail in this position,\r\nlooking the image of discomfort. Discomfort, without any fear, is\r\nsimilarly expressed: thus, one day I went out of doors, just at the\r\ntime when this same dog knew that her dinner would be brought. I did\r\nnot call her, but she wished much to accompany me, and at the same time\r\nshe wished much for her dinner; and there she stood, first looking one\r\nway and then the other, with her tail tucked in and ears drawn back,\r\npresenting an unmistakable appearance of perplexed discomfort.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the expressive movements now described, with the exception\r\nof the grinning from joy, are innate or instinctive, for they are\r\ncommon to all the individuals, young and old, of all the breeds. Most\r\nof them are likewise common to the aboriginal parents of the dog,\r\nnamely the wolf and jackal; and some of them to other species of the\r\nsame group. Tamed wolves and jackals, when caressed by their masters,\r\njump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their\r\nmaster’s hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground\r\nbelly upwards.[504] I have seen a rather fox-like African jackal, from\r\nthe Gaboon, depress its ears when caressed. Wolves and jackals, when\r\nfrightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been\r\ndescribed as careering round his master in circles and figures of\r\neight, like a dog, with his tail between his legs.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated[505] that foxes, however tame, never display any of\r\nthe above expressive movements; but this is not strictly accurate. Many\r\nyears ago I observed in the Zoological Gardens, and recorded the fact\r\nat the time, that a very tame English fox, When caressed by the keeper,\r\nwagged its tail, depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the\r\nground, belly upwards. The black fox of North America likewise\r\ndepressed its ears in a slight degree. But I believe that foxes never\r\nlick the hands of their masters, and I have been assured that when\r\nfrightened they never tuck in their tails. If the explanation which I\r\nhave given of the expression of affection in dogs be admitted, then it\r\nwould appear that animals which have never been domesticated—namely\r\nwolves, jackals, and even foxes—have nevertheless acquired, through the\r\nprinciple of antithesis, certain expressive gestures; for it is not\r\nprobable that these animals, confined in cages, should have learnt them\r\nby imitating dogs.\r\n\r\n_Cats_.—I have already described the actions of a cat (fig. 9), when\r\nfeeling savage and not terrified. She assumes a crouching attitude and\r\noccasionally protrudes her fore-feet, with the claws exserted ready for\r\nstriking. The tail is extended, being curled or lashed from side to\r\nside. The hair is not erected—at least it was not so in the few cases\r\nobserved by me. The ears are drawn closely backwards and the teeth are\r\nshown. Low savage growls are uttered. We can understand why the\r\nattitude assumed by a cat when preparing to fight with another cat, or\r\nin any way greatly irritated, is so widely different from that of a dog\r\napproaching another dog with hostile intentions; for the cat uses her\r\nfore-feet for striking, and this renders a crouching position\r\nconvenient or necessary. She is also much more accustomed than a dog to\r\nlie concealed and suddenly spring on her prey. No cause can be assigned\r\nwith certainty for the tail being lashed or curled from side to side.\r\nThis habit is common to many other animals—for instance, to the puma,\r\nwhen prepared to spring;[506] but it is not common to dogs, or to\r\nfoxes, as I infer from Mr. St. John’s account of a fox lying in wait\r\nand seizing a hare. We have already seen that some kinds of lizards and\r\nvarious snakes, when excited, rapidly vibrate the tips of their tails.\r\nIt would appear as if, under strong excitement, there existed an\r\nuncontrollable desire for movement of some kind, owing to nerve-force\r\nbeing freely liberated from the excited sensorium; and that as the tail\r\nis left free, and as its movement does not disturb the general position\r\nof the body, it is curled or lashed about.\r\n\r\nAll the movements of a cat, when feeling affectionate, are in complete\r\nantithesis to those just described. She now stands upright, with\r\nslightly arched back, tail perpendicularly raised, and ears erected;\r\nand she rubs her cheeks and flanks against her master or mistress. The\r\ndesire to rub something is so strong in cats under this state of mind,\r\nthat they may often be seen rubbing themselves against the legs of\r\nchairs or tables, or against door-posts. This manner of expressing\r\naffection probably originated through association, as in the case of\r\ndogs, from the mother nursing and fondling her young; and perhaps from\r\nthe young themselves loving each other and playing together. Another\r\nand very different gesture, expressive of pleasure, has already been\r\ndescribed, namely, the curious manner in which young and even old cats,\r\nwhen pleased, alternately protrude their fore-feet, with separated\r\ntoes, as if pushing against and sucking their mother’s teats. This\r\nhabit is so far analogous to that of rubbing against something, that\r\nboth apparently are derived from actions performed during the nursing\r\nperiod. Why cats should show affection by rubbing so much more than do\r\ndogs, though the latter delight in contact with their masters, and why\r\ncats only occasionally lick the hands of their friends, whilst dogs\r\nalways do so, I cannot say. Cats cleanse themselves by licking their\r\nown coats more regularly than do dogs. On the other hand, their tongues\r\nseem less well fitted for the work than the longer and more flexible\r\ntongues of dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCat Terrified at a Dog.  Fig.15\r\n\r\nCats, when terrified, stand at full height, and arch their backs in a\r\nwell-known and ridiculous fashion. They spit, hiss, or growl. The hair\r\nover the whole body, and especially on the tail, becomes erect. In the\r\ninstances observed by me the basal part of the tail was held upright,\r\nthe terminal part being thrown on one side; but sometimes the tail (see\r\nfig. 15) is only a little raised, and is bent almost from the base to\r\none side. The ears are drawn back, and the teeth exposed. When two\r\nkittens are playing together, the one often thus tries to frighten the\r\nother. From what we have seen in former chapters, all the above points\r\nof expression are intelligible, except the extreme arching of the back.\r\nI am inclined to believe that, in the same manner as many birds, whilst\r\nthey ruffle their feathers, spread out their wings and tail, to make\r\nthemselves look as big as possible, so cats stand upright at their full\r\nheight, arch their backs, often raise the basal part of the tail, and\r\nerect their hair, for the same purpose. The lynx, when attacked, is\r\nsaid to arch its back, and is thus figured by Brehm. But the keepers in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens have never seen any tendency to this action in\r\nthe larger feline animals, such as tigers, lions, &c.; and these have\r\nlittle cause to be afraid of any other animal.\r\n\r\nCats use their voices much as a means of expression, and they utter,\r\nunder various emotions and desires, at least six or seven different\r\nsounds. The purr of satisfaction, which is made during both inspiration\r\nand expiration, is one of the most curious. The puma, cheetah, and\r\nocelot likewise purr; but the tiger, when pleased, “emits a peculiar\r\nshort snuffle, accompanied by the closure of the eyelids.”[507] It is\r\nsaid that the lion, jaguar, and leopard, do not purr.\r\n\r\n_Horses_.—Horses when savage draw their ears closely back, protrude\r\ntheir heads, and partially uncover their incisor teeth, ready for\r\nbiting. When inclined to kick behind, they generally, through habit,\r\ndraw back their ears; and their eyes are turned backwards in a peculiar\r\nmanner.[508] When pleased, as when some coveted food is brought to them\r\nin the stable, they raise and draw in their heads, prick their ears,\r\nand looking intently towards their friend, often whinny. Impatience is\r\nexpressed by pawing the ground.\r\n\r\nThe actions of a horse when much startled are highly expressive. One\r\nday my horse was much frightened at a drilling machine, covered by a\r\ntarpaulin, and lying on an open field. He raised his head so high, that\r\nhis neck became almost perpendicular; and this he did from habit, for\r\nthe machine lay on a slope below, and could not have been seen with\r\nmore distinctness through the raising of the head; nor if any sound had\r\nproceeded from it, could the sound have been more distinctly heard. His\r\neyes and ears were directed intently forwards; and I could feel through\r\nthe saddle the palpitations of his heart. With red dilated nostrils he\r\nsnorted violently, and whirling round, would have dashed off at full\r\nspeed, had I not prevented him. The distension of the nostrils is not\r\nfor the sake of scenting the source of danger, for when a horse smells\r\ncarefully at any object and is not alarmed, he does not dilate his\r\nnostrils. Owing to the presence of a valve in the throat, a horse when\r\npanting does not breathe through his open mouth, but through his\r\nnostrils; and these consequently have become endowed with great powers\r\nof expansion. This expansion of the nostrils, as well as the snorting,\r\nand the palpitations of the heart, are actions which have become firmly\r\nassociated during a long series of generations with the emotion of\r\nterror; for terror has habitually led the horse to the most violent\r\nexertion in dashing away at full speed from the cause of danger.\r\n\r\n_Ruminants_.—Cattle and sheep are remarkable from displaying in so\r\nslight a degree their emotions or sensations, excepting that of extreme\r\npain. A bull when enraged exhibits his rage only by the manner in which\r\nhe holds his lowered head, with distended nostrils, and by bellowing.\r\nHe also often paws the ground; but this pawing seems quite different\r\nfrom that of an impatient horse, for when the soil is loose, he throws\r\nup clouds of dust. I believe that bulls act in this manner when\r\nirritated by flies, for the sake of driving them away. The wilder\r\nbreeds of sheep and the chamois when startled stamp on the ground, and\r\nwhistle through their noses; and this serves as a danger-signal to\r\ntheir comrades. The musk-ox of the Arctic regions, when encountered,\r\nlikewise stamps on the ground.[509] How this stamping action arose I\r\ncannot conjecture; for from inquiries which I have made it does not\r\nappear that any of these animals fight with their fore-legs.\r\n\r\nSome species of deer, when savage, display far more expression than do\r\ncattle, sheep, or goats, for, as has already been stated, they draw\r\nback their ears, grind their teeth, erect their hair, squeal, stamp on\r\nthe ground, and brandish their horns. One day in the Zoological\r\nGardens, the Formosan deer (_Cervus pseudaxis_) approached me in a\r\ncurious attitude, with his muzzle raised high up, so that the horns\r\nwere pressed back on his neck; the head being held rather obliquely.\r\nFrom the expression of his eye I felt sure that he was savage; he\r\napproached slowly, and as soon as he came close to the iron bars, he\r\ndid not lower his head to butt at me, but suddenly bent it inwards, and\r\nstruck his horns with great force against the railings. Mr. Bartlett\r\ninforms me that some other species of deer place themselves in the same\r\nattitude when enraged.\r\n\r\n_Monkeys_.—The various species and genera of monkeys express their\r\nfeelings in many different ways; and this fact is interesting, as in\r\nsome degree bearing on the question, whether the so-called races of man\r\nshould be ranked as distinct species or varieties; for, as we shall see\r\nin the following chapters, the different races of man express their\r\nemotions and sensations with remarkable uniformity throughout the\r\nworld. Some of the expressive actions of monkeys are interesting in\r\nanother way, namely from being closely analogous to those of man. As I\r\nhave had no opportunity of observing any one species of the group under\r\nall circumstances, my miscellaneous remarks will be best arranged under\r\ndifferent states of the mind.\r\n\r\n_Pleasure, joy, affection_—It is not possible to distinguish in\r\nmonkeys, at least without more experience than I have had, the\r\nexpression of pleasure or joy from that of affection. Young chimpanzees\r\nmake a kind of barking noise, when pleased by the return of any one to\r\nwhom they are attached. When this noise, which the keepers call a\r\nlaugh, is uttered, the lips are protruded; but so they are under\r\nvarious other emotions. Nevertheless I could perceive that when they\r\nwere pleased the form of the lips differed a little from that assumed\r\nwhen they were angered. If a young chimpanzee be tickled—and the\r\narmpits are particularly sensitive to tickling, as in the case of our\r\nchildren,—a more decided chuckling or laughing sound is uttered; though\r\nthe laughter is sometimes noiseless. The corners of the mouth are then\r\ndrawn backwards; and this sometimes causes the lower eyelids to be\r\nslightly wrinkled. But this wrinkling, which is so characteristic of\r\nour own laughter, is more plainly seen in some other monkeys. The teeth\r\nin the upper jaw in the chimpanzee are not exposed when they utter\r\ntheir laughing noise, in which respect they differ from us. But their\r\neyes sparkle and grow brighter, as Mr. W. L. Martin,[510] who has\r\nparticularly attended to their expression, states.\r\n\r\nYoung Orangs, when tickled, likewise grin and make a chuckling sound;\r\nand Mr. Martin says that their eyes grow brighter. As soon as their\r\nlaughter ceases, an expression may be detected passing over their\r\nfaces, which, as Mr. Wallace remarked to me, may be called a smile. I\r\nhave also noticed something of the same kind with the chimpanzee. Dr.\r\nDuchenne—and I cannot quote a better authority—informs me that he kept\r\na very tame monkey in his house for a year; and when he gave it during\r\nmeal-times some choice delicacy, he observed that the corners of its\r\nmouth were slightly raised; thus an expression of satisfaction,\r\npartaking of the nature of an incipient smile, and resembling that\r\noften seen on the face of main, could be plainly perceived in this\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe _Cebus azaræ_,[511] when rejoiced at again seeing a beloved person,\r\nutters a peculiar tittering (_kichernden_) sound. It also expresses\r\nagreeable sensations, by drawing back the corners of its mouth, without\r\nproducing any sound. Rengger calls this movement laughter, but it would\r\nbe more appropriately called a smile. The form of the mouth is\r\ndifferent when either pain or terror is expressed, and high shrieks are\r\nuttered. Another species of _Cebus_ in the Zoological Gardens (_C.\r\nhypoleucus_) when pleased, makes a reiterated shrill note, and likewise\r\ndraws back the corners of its mouth, apparently through the contraction\r\nof the same muscles as with us. So does the Barbary ape (_Inuus\r\necaudatus_) to an extraordinary degree; and I observed in this monkey\r\nthat the skin of the lower eyelids then became much wrinkled. At the\r\nsame time it rapidly moved its lower jaw or lips in a spasmodic manner,\r\nthe teeth being exposed; but the noise produced was hardly more\r\ndistinct than that which we sometimes call silent laughter. Two of the\r\nkeepers affirmed that this slight sound was the animal’s laughter, and\r\nwhen I expressed some doubt on this head (being at the time quite\r\ninexperienced), they made it attack or rather threaten a hated Entellus\r\nmonkey, living in the same compartment. Instantly the whole expression\r\nof the face of the Inuus changed; the mouth was opened much more\r\nwidely, the canine teeth were more fully exposed, and a hoarse barking\r\nnoise was uttered.\r\n\r\nThe Anubis baboon (_Cynocephalus anubis_) was first insulted and put\r\ninto a furious rage, as was easily done, by his keeper, who then made\r\nfriends with him and shook hands. As the reconciliation was effected\r\nthe baboon rapidly moved up and down his jaws and lips, and looked\r\npleased. When we laugh heartily, a similar movement, or quiver, may be\r\nobserved more or less distinctly in our jaws; but with man the muscles\r\nof the chest are more particularly acted on, whilst with this baboon,\r\nand with some other monkeys, it is the muscles of the jaws and lips\r\nwhich are spasmodically affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCynopithecus Niger, in a Placid Condition. Fig.16-17\r\n\r\nI have already had occasion to remark on the curious manner in which\r\ntwo or three species of Alacacus and the _Cynopithecus niger_ draw back\r\ntheir ears and utter a slight jabbering noise, when they are pleased by\r\nbeing caressed. With the Cynopithecus (fig. 17), the corners of the\r\nmouth are at the same time drawn backwards and upwards, so that the\r\nteeth are exposed. Hence this expression would never be recognized by a\r\nstranger as one of pleasure. The crest of long hairs on the forehead is\r\ndepressed, and apparently the whole skin of the head drawn backwards.\r\nThe eyebrows are thus raised a little, and the eyes assume a staring\r\nappearance. The lower eyelids also become slightly wrinkled; but this\r\nwrinkling is not conspicuous, owing to the permanent transverse furrows\r\non the face.\r\n\r\n_Painful emotions and sensations_.—With monkeys the expression of\r\nslight pain, or of any painful emotion, such as grief, vexation,\r\njealousy, &c., is not easily distinguished from that of moderate anger;\r\nand these states of mind readily and quickly pass into each other.\r\nGrief, however, with some species is certainly exhibited by weeping. A\r\nwoman, who sold a monkey to the Zoological Society, believed to have\r\ncome from Borneo (_Macacus maurus_ or _M. inornatus_ of Gray), said\r\nthat it often cried; and Mr. Bartlett, as well as the keeper Mr.\r\nSutton, have repeatedly seen it, when grieved, or even when much\r\npitied, weeping so copiously that the tears rolled down its cheeks.\r\nThere is, however, something strange about this case, for two specimens\r\nsubsequently kept in the Gardens, and believed to be the same species,\r\nhave never been seen to weep, though they were carefully observed by\r\nthe keeper and myself when much distressed and loudly screaming.\r\nRengger states[512] that the eyes of the _Cebus azaræ_ fill with tears,\r\nbut not sufficiently to overflow, when it is prevented getting some\r\nmuch desired object, or is much frightened. Humboldt also asserts that\r\nthe eyes of the _Callithrix sciureus_ “instantly fill with tears when\r\nit is seized with fear;” but when this pretty little monkey in the\r\nZoological Gardens was teased, so as to cry out loudly, this did not\r\noccur. I do not, however, wish to throw the least doubt on the accuracy\r\nof Humboldt’s statement.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of dejection in young orangs and chimpanzees, when out\r\nof health, is as plain and almost as pathetic as in the case of our\r\nchildren. This state of mind and body is shown by their listless\r\nmovements, fallen countenances, dull eyes, and changed complexion.\r\n\r\n_Anger_.—This emotion is often exhibited by many kinds of monkeys, and\r\nis expressed, as Mr. Martin remarks,[513] in many different ways. “Some\r\nspecies, when irritated, pout the lips, gaze with a fixed and savage\r\nglare on their foe, and make repeated short starts as if about to\r\nspring forward, uttering at the same time inward guttural sounds. Many\r\ndisplay their anger by suddenly advancing, making abrupt starts, at the\r\nsame time opening the mouth and pursing up the lips, so as to conceal\r\nthe teeth, while the eyes are daringly fixed on the enemy, as if in\r\nsavage defiance. Some again, and principally the long-tailed monkeys,\r\nor Guenons, display their teeth, and accompany their malicious grins\r\nwith a sharp, abrupt, reiterated cry.” Mr. Sutton confirms the\r\nstatement that some species uncover their teeth when enraged, whilst\r\nothers conceal them by the protrusion of their lips; and some kinds\r\ndraw back their ears. The _Cynopithecus niger_, lately referred to,\r\nacts in this manner, at the same time depressing the crest of hair on\r\nits forehead, and showing its teeth; so that the movements of the\r\nfeatures from anger are nearly the same as those from pleasure; and the\r\ntwo expressions can be distinguished only by those familiar with the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nBaboons often show their passion and threaten their enemies in a very\r\nodd manner, namely, by opening their mouths widely as in the act of\r\nyawning. Mr. Bartlett has often seen two baboons, when first placed in\r\nthe same compartment, sitting opposite to each other and thus\r\nalternately opening their mouths; and this action seems frequently to\r\nend in a real yawn. Mr. Bartlett believes that both animals wish to\r\nshow to each other that they are provided with a formidable set of\r\nteeth, as is undoubtedly the case. As I could hardly credit the reality\r\nof this yawning gesture, Mr. Bartlett insulted an old baboon and put\r\nhim into a violent passion; and he almost immediately thus acted. Some\r\nspecies of Macacus and of Cereopithecus[514] behave in the same manner.\r\nBaboons likewise show their anger, as was observed by Brehin with those\r\nwhich he kept alive in Abyssinia, in another manner, namely, by\r\nstriking the ground with one hand, “like an angry man striking the\r\ntable with his fist.” I have seen this movement with the baboons in the\r\nZoological Gardens; but sometimes the action seems rather to represent\r\nthe searching for a stone or other object in their beds of straw.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton has often observed the face of the _Macacus rhesus_, when\r\nmuch enraged, growing red. As he was mentioning this to me, another\r\nmonkey attacked a _rhesus_, and I saw its face redden as plainly as\r\nthat of a man in a violent passion. In the course of a few minutes,\r\nafter the battle, the face of this monkey recovered its natural tint.\r\nAt the same time that the face reddened, the naked posterior part of\r\nthe body, which is always red, seemed to grow still redder; but I\r\ncannot positively assert that this was the case. When the Mandrill is\r\nin any way excited, the brilliantly coloured, naked parts of the skin\r\nare said to become still more vividly coloured.\r\n\r\nWith several species of baboons the ridge of the forehead projects much\r\nover the eyes, and is studded with a few long hairs, representing our\r\neyebrows. These animals are always looking about them, and in order to\r\nlook upwards they raise their eyebrows. They have thus, as it would\r\nappear, acquired the habit of frequently moving their eyebrows. However\r\nthis may be, many kinds of monkeys, especially the baboons, when\r\nangered or in any way excited, rapidly and incessantly move their\r\neyebrows up and down, as well as the hairy skin of their\r\nforeheads.[515] As we associate in the case of man the raising and\r\nlowering of the eyebrows with definite states of the mind, the almost\r\nincessant movement of the eyebrows by monkeys gives them a senseless\r\nexpression. I once observed a man who had a trick of continually\r\nraising his eyebrows without any corresponding emotion, and this gave\r\nto him a foolish appearance; so it is with some persons who keep the\r\ncorners of their mouths a little drawn backwards and upwards, as if by\r\nan incipient smile, though at the time they are not amused or pleased.\r\n\r\nA young orang, made jealous by her keeper attending to another monkey,\r\nslightly uncovered her teeth, and, uttering a peevish noise like\r\n_tish-shist_, turned her back on him. Both orangs and chimpanzees, when\r\na little more angered, protrude their lips greatly, and make a harsh\r\nbarking noise. A young female chimpanzee, in a violent passion,\r\npresented a curious resemblance to a child in the same state. She\r\nscreamed loudly with widely open mouth, the lips being retracted so\r\nthat the teeth were fully exposed. She threw her arms wildly about,\r\nsometimes clasping them over her head. She rolled on the ground,\r\nsometimes on her back, sometimes on her belly, and bit everything\r\nwithin reach. A young gibbon (_Hylobates syndactylus_) in a passion has\r\nbeen described[516] as behaving in almost exactly the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe lips of young orangs and chimpanzees are protruded, sometimes to a\r\nwonderful degree, under various circumstances. They act thus, not only\r\nwhen slightly angered, sulky, or disappointed, but when alarmed at\r\nanything—in one instance, at the sight of a turtle,[517]—and likewise\r\nwhen pleased. But neither the degree of protrusion nor the shape of the\r\nmouth is exactly the same, as I believe, in all cases; and the sounds\r\nwhich are then uttered are different. The accompanying drawing\r\nrepresents a chimpanzee made sulky by an orange having been offered\r\nhim, and then taken away. A similar protrusion or pouting of the lips,\r\nthough to a much slighter degree, may be seen in sulky children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChimpanzee Disappointed and Sulky. Fig. 18\r\n\r\nMany years ago, in the Zoological Gardens, I placed a looking-glass on\r\nthe floor before two young orangs, who, as far as it was known, had\r\nnever before seen one. At first they gazed at their own images with the\r\nmost steady surprise, and often changed their point of view. They then\r\napproached close and protruded their lips towards the image, as if to\r\nkiss it, in exactly the same manner as they had previously done towards\r\neach other, when first placed, a few days before, in the same room.\r\nThey next made all sorts of grimaces, and put themselves in various\r\nattitudes before the mirror; they pressed and rubbed the surface; they\r\nplaced their hands at different distances behind it; looked behind it;\r\nand finally seemed almost frightened, started a little, became cross,\r\nand refused to look any longer.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to perform some little action which is difficult and\r\nrequires precision, for instance, to thread a needle, we generally\r\nclose our lips firmly, for the sake, I presume, of not disturbing our\r\nmovements by breathing; and I noticed the same action in a young Orang.\r\nThe poor little creature was sick, and was amusing itself by trying to\r\nkill the flies on the window-panes with its knuckles; this was\r\ndifficult as the flies buzzed about, and at each attempt the lips were\r\nfirmly compressed, and at the same time slightly protruded.\r\n\r\nAlthough the countenances, and more especially the gestures, of orangs\r\nand chimpanzees are in some respects highly expressive, I doubt whether\r\non the whole they are so expressive as those of some other kinds of\r\nmonkeys. This may be attributed in part to their ears being immovable,\r\nand in part to the nakedness of their eyebrows, of which the movements\r\nare thus rendered less conspicuous. When, however, they raise their\r\neyebrows their foreheads become, as with us, transversely wrinkled. In\r\ncomparison with man, their faces are inexpressive, chiefly owing to\r\ntheir not frowning under any emotion of the mind—that is, as far as I\r\nhave been able to observe, and I carefully attended to this point.\r\nFrowning, which is one of the most important of all the expressions in\r\nman, is due to the contraction of the corrugators by which the eyebrows\r\nare lowered and brought together, so that vertical furrows are formed\r\non the forehead. Both the orang and chimpanzee are said[518] to possess\r\nthis muscle, but it seems rarely brought into action, at least in a\r\nconspicuous manner. I made my hands into a sort of cage, and placing\r\nsome tempting fruit within, allowed both a young orang and chimpanzee\r\nto try their utmost to get it out; but although they grew rather cross,\r\nthey showed not a trace of a frown. Nor was there any frown when they\r\nwere enraged. Twice I took two chimpanzees from their rather dark room\r\nsuddenly into bright sunshine, which would certainly have caused us to\r\nfrown; they blinked and winked their eyes, but only once did I see a\r\nvery slight frown. On another occasion, I tickled the nose of a\r\nchimpanzee with a straw, and as it crumpled up its face, slight\r\nvertical furrows appeared between the eyebrows. I have never seen a\r\nfrown on the forehead of the orang.\r\n\r\nThe gorilla, when enraged, is described as erecting its crest of hair,\r\nthrowing down its under lip, dilating its nostrils, and uttering\r\nterrific yells. Messrs. Savage and Wyman[519] state that the scalp can\r\nbe freely moved backwards and forwards, and that when the animal is\r\nexcited it is strongly contracted; but I presume that they mean by this\r\nlatter expression that the scalp is lowered; for they likewise speak of\r\nthe young chimpanzee, when crying out, as having the eyebrows strongly\r\ncontracted. The great power of movement in the scalp of the gorilla, of\r\nmany baboons and other monkeys, deserves notice in relation to the\r\npower possessed by some few men, either through reversion or\r\npersistence, of voluntarily moving their scalps.[520]\r\n\r\n_Astonishment, Terror_—A living fresh-water turtle was placed at my\r\nrequest in the same compartment in the Zoological Gardens with many\r\nmonkeys; and they showed unbounded astonishment, as well as some fear.\r\nThis was displayed by their remaining motionless, staring intently with\r\nwidely opened eyes, their eyebrows being often moved up and down. Their\r\nfaces seemed somewhat lengthened. They occasionally raised themselves\r\non their hind-legs to get abetter view. They often retreated a few\r\nfeet, and then turning their heads over one shoulder, again stared\r\nintently. It was curious to observe how much less afraid they were of\r\nthe turtle than of a living snake which I had formerly placed in their\r\ncompartment;[521] for in the course of a few minutes some of the\r\nmonkeys ventured to approach and touch the turtle. On the other hand,\r\nsome of the larger baboons were greatly terrified, and grinned as if on\r\nthe point of screaming out. When I showed a little dressed-up doll to\r\nthe _Cynopithecus niger_, it stood motionless, stared intently with\r\nwidely opened eyes, and advanced its ears a little forwards. But when\r\nthe turtle was placed in its compartment, this monkey also moved its\r\nlips in an odd, rapid, jabbering manner, which the keeper declared was\r\nmeant to conciliate or please the turtle.\r\n\r\nI was never able clearly to perceive that the eyebrows of astonished\r\nmonkeys were kept permanently raised, though they were frequently moved\r\nup and down. Attention, which precedes astonishment, is expressed by\r\nman by a slight raising of the eyebrows; and Dr. Duchenne informs me\r\nthat when he gave to the monkey formerly mentioned some quite new\r\narticle of food, it elevated its eyebrows a little, thus assuming an\r\nappearance of close attention. It then took the food in its fingers,\r\nand, with lowered or rectilinear eyebrows, scratched, smelt, and\r\nexamined it,—an expression of reflection being thus exhibited.\r\nSometimes it would throw back its head a little, and again with\r\nsuddenly raised eyebrows re-examine and finally taste the food.\r\n\r\nIn no case did any monkey keep its mouth open when it was astonished.\r\nMr. Sutton observed for me a young orang and chimpanzee during a\r\nconsiderable length of time; and however much they were astonished, or\r\nwhilst listening intently to some strange sound, they did not keep\r\ntheir mouths open. This fact is surprising, as with mankind hardly any\r\nexpression is more general than a widely open mouth under the sense of\r\nastonishment. As far as I have been able to observe, monkeys breathe\r\nmore freely through their nostrils than men do; and this may account\r\nfor their not opening their mouths when they are astonished; for, as we\r\nshall see in a future chapter, man apparently acts in this manner when\r\nstartled, at first for the sake of quickly drawing a full inspiration,\r\nand afterwards for the sake of breathing as quietly as possible.\r\n\r\nTerror is expressed by many kinds of monkeys by the utterance of shrill\r\nscreams; the lips being drawn back, so that the teeth are exposed. The\r\nhair becomes erect, especially when some anger is likewise felt. Mr.\r\nSutton has distinctly seen the face of the _Macacus rhesus_ grow pale\r\nfrom fear. Monkeys also tremble from fear; and sometimes they void\r\ntheir excretions. I have seen one which, when caught, almost fainted\r\nfrom an excess of terror.\r\n\r\nSufficient facts have now been given with respect to the expressions of\r\nvarious animals. It is impossible to agree with Sir C. Bell when he\r\nsays[522] that “the faces of animals seem chiefly capable of expressing\r\nrage and fear;” and again, when he says that all their expressions “may\r\nbe referred, more or less plainly, to their acts of volition or\r\nnecessary instincts.” He who will look at a dog preparing to attack\r\nanother dog or a man, and at the same animal when caressing his master,\r\nor will watch the countenance of a monkey when insulted, and when\r\nfondled by his keeper, will be forced to admit that the movements of\r\ntheir features and their gestures are almost as expressive as those of\r\nman. Although no explanation can be given of some of the expressions in\r\nthe lower animals, the greater number are explicable in accordance with\r\nthe three principles given at the commencement of the first chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS OF MAN: SUFFERING AND WEEPING.\r\n\r\nThe screaming and weeping of infants—Forms of features—Age at which\r\nweeping commences—The effects of habitual restraint on\r\nweeping—Sobbing—Cause of the contraction of the muscles round the eyes\r\nduring screaming—Cause of the secretion of tears.\r\n\r\nIn this and the following chapters the expressions exhibited by Man\r\nunder various states of the mind will be described and explained, as\r\nfar as lies in my power. My observations will be arranged according to\r\nthe order which I have found the most convenient; and this will\r\ngenerally lead to opposite emotions and sensations succeeding each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Suffering of the body and mind: weeping_.—I have already described in\r\nsufficient detail, in the third chapter, the signs of extreme pain, as\r\nshown by screams or groans, with the writhing of the whole body and the\r\nteeth clenched or ground together. These signs are often accompanied or\r\nfollowed by profuse sweating, pallor, trembling, utter prostration, or\r\nfaintness. No suffering is greater than that from extreme fear or\r\nhorror, but here a distinct emotion comes into play, and will be\r\nelsewhere considered. Prolonged suffering, especially of the mind,\r\npasses into low spirits, grief, dejection, and despair, and these\r\nstates will be the subject of the following chapter. Here I shall\r\nalmost confine myself to weeping or crying, more especially in\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nInfants, when suffering even slight pain, moderate hunger, or\r\ndiscomfort, utter violent and prolonged screams. Whilst thus screaming\r\ntheir eyes are firmly closed, so that the skin round them is wrinkled,\r\nand the forehead contracted into a frown. The mouth is widely opened\r\nwith the lips retracted in a peculiar manner, which causes it to assume\r\na squarish form; the gums or teeth being more or less exposed. The\r\nbreath is inhaled almost spasmodically. It is easy to observe infants\r\nwhilst screaming; but I have found photographs made by the\r\ninstantaneous process the best means for observation, as allowing more\r\ndeliberation. I have collected twelve, most of them made purposely for\r\nme; and they all exhibit the same general characteristics. I have,\r\ntherefore, had six of them[601] (Plate I.) reproduced by the heliotype\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreaming Infants. Plate I.\r\n\r\nThe firm closing of the eyelids and consequent compression of the\r\neyeball,—and this is a most important element in various\r\nexpressions,—serves to protect the eyes from becoming too much gorged\r\nwith blood, as will presently be explained in detail. With respect to\r\nthe order in which the several muscles contract in firmly compressing\r\nthe eyes, I am indebted to Dr. Langstaff, of Southampton, for some\r\nobservations, which I have since repeated. The best plan for observing\r\nthe order is to make a person first raise his eyebrows, and this\r\nproduces transverse wrinkles across the forehead; and then very\r\ngradually to contract all the muscles round the elves with as much\r\nforce as possible. The reader who is unacquainted with the anatomy of\r\nthe face, ought to refer to p. 24, and look at the woodcuts 1 to 3. The\r\ncorrugators of the brow (_corrugator supercilii_) seem to be the first\r\nmuscles to contract; and these draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards\r\ntowards the base of the nose, causing vertical furrows, that is a\r\nfrown, to appear between the eyebrows; at the same time they cause the\r\ndisappearance of the transverse wrinkles across the forehead. The\r\norbicular muscles contract almost simultaneously with the corrugators,\r\nand produce wrinkles all round the eyes; they appear, however, to be\r\nenabled to contract with greater force, as soon as the contraction of\r\nthe corrugators has given them some support. Lastly, the pyramidal\r\nmuscles of the nose contract; and these draw the eyebrows and the skin\r\nof the forehead still lower down, producing short transverse wrinkles\r\nacross the base of the nose.[602] For the sake of brevity these muscles\r\nwill generally be spoken of as the orbiculars, or as those surrounding\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen these muscles are strongly contracted, those running to the upper\r\nlip[603] likewise contract and raise the upper lip. This might have\r\nbeen expected from the manner in which at least one of them, the\r\n_malaris_, is connected with the orbiculars. Any one who will gradually\r\ncontract the muscles round his eyes, will feel, as he increases the\r\nforce, that his upper lip and the wings of his nose (which are partly\r\nacted on by one of the same muscles) are almost always a little drawn\r\nup. If he keeps his mouth firmly shut whilst contracting the muscles\r\nround the eyes, and then suddenly relaxes his lips, he will feel that\r\nthe pressure on his eyes immediately increases. So again when a person\r\non a bright, glaring day wishes to look at a distant object, but is\r\ncompelled partially to close his eyelids, the upper lip may almost\r\nalways be observed to be somewhat raised. The mouths of some very\r\nshort-sighted persons, who are forced habitually to reduce the aperture\r\nof their eyes, wear from this same reason a grinning expression.\r\n\r\nThe raising of the upper lip draws upwards the flesh of the upper parts\r\nof the cheeks, and produces a strongly marked fold on each cheek,—the\r\nnaso-labial fold,—which runs from near the wings of the nostrils to the\r\ncorners of the mouth and below them. This fold or furrow may be seen in\r\nall the photographs, and is very characteristic of the expression of a\r\ncrying child; though a nearly similar fold is produced in the act of\r\nlaughing or smiling.[604]\r\n\r\nAs the upper lip is much drawn up during the act of screaming, in the\r\nmanner just explained, the depressor muscles of the angles of the mouth\r\n(see K in woodcuts 1 and 2) are strongly contracted in order to keep\r\nthe mouth widely open, so that a full volume of sound may be poured\r\nforth. The action of these opposed muscles, above and below, tends to\r\ngive to the mouth an oblong, almost squarish outline, as may be seen in\r\nthe accompanying photographs. An excellent observer,[605] in describing\r\na baby crying whilst being fed, says, “it made its mouth like a square,\r\nand let the porridge run out at all four corners.” I believe, but we\r\nshall return to this point in a future chapter, that the depressor\r\nmuscles of the angles of the mouth are less under the separate control\r\nof the will than the adjoining muscles; so that if a young child is\r\nonly doubtfully inclined to cry, this muscle is generally the first to\r\ncontract, and is the last to cease contracting. When older children\r\ncommence crying, the muscles which run to the upper lip are often the\r\nfirst to contract; and this may perhaps be due to older children not\r\nhaving so strong a tendency to scream loudly, and consequently to keep\r\ntheir mouths widely open; so that the above-named depressor muscles are\r\nnot brought into such strong action.\r\n\r\nWith one of my own infants, from his eighth day and for some time\r\nafterwards, I often observed that the first sign of a screaming-fit,\r\nwhen it could be observed coming on gradually, was a little frown,\r\nowing to the contraction of the corrugators of the brows; the\r\ncapillaries of the naked head and face becoming at the same time\r\nreddened with blood. As soon as the screaming-fit actually began, all\r\nthe muscles round the eyes were strongly contracted, and the mouth\r\nwidely opened in the manner above described; so that at this early\r\nperiod the features assumed the same form as at a more advanced age.\r\n\r\nDr. Piderit[606] lays great stress on the contraction of certain\r\nmuscles which draw down the nose and narrow the nostrils, as eminently\r\ncharacteristic of a crying expression. The _depressores anguli oris_,\r\nas we have just seen, are usually contracted at the same time, and they\r\nindirectly tend, according to Dr. Duchenne, to act in this same manner\r\non the nose. With children having bad colds a similar pinched\r\nappearance of the nose may be noticed, which is at least partly due, as\r\nremarked to me by Dr. Langstaff, to their constant snuffling, and the\r\nconsequent pressure of the atmosphere on the two sides. The purpose of\r\nthis contraction of the nostrils by children having bad colds, or\r\nwhilst crying, seems to be to check the downward flow of the mucus and\r\ntears, and to prevent these fluids spreading over the upper lip.\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged and severe screaming-fit, the scalp, face, and eyes\r\nare reddened, owing to the return of the blood from the head having\r\nbeen impeded by the violent expiratory efforts; but the redness of the\r\nstimulated eyes is chiefly due to the copious effusion of tears. The\r\nvarious muscles of the face which have been strongly contracted, still\r\ntwitch a little, and the upper lip is still slightly drawn up or\r\neverted,[607] with the corners of the mouth still a little drawn\r\ndownwards. I have myself felt, and have observed in other grown-up\r\npersons, that when tears are restrained with difficulty, as in reading\r\na pathetic story, it is almost impossible to prevent the various\r\nmuscles. which with young children are brought into strong action\r\nduring their screaming-fits, from slightly twitching or trembling.\r\n\r\nInfants whilst young do not shed tears or weep, as is well known to\r\nnurses and medical men. This circumstance is not exclusively due to the\r\nlacrymal glands being as yet incapable of secreting tears. I first\r\nnoticed this fact from having accidentally brushed with the cuff of my\r\ncoat the open eye of one of my infants, when seventy-seven days old,\r\ncausing this eye to water freely; and though the child screamed\r\nviolently, the other eye remained dry, or was only slightly suffused\r\nwith tears. A similar slight effusion occurred ten days previously in\r\nboth eyes during a screaming-fit. The tears did not run over the\r\neyelids and roll down the cheeks of this child, whilst screaming badly,\r\nwhen 122 days old. This first happened 17 days later, at the age of 139\r\ndays. A few other children have been observed for me, and the period of\r\nfree weeping appears to be very variable. In one case, the eyes became\r\nslightly suffused at the age of only 20 days; in another, at 62 days.\r\nWith two other children, the tears did NOT run down the face at the\r\nages of 84 and 110 days; but in a third child they did run down at the\r\nage of 104 days. In one instance, as I was positively assured, tears\r\nran down at the unusually early age of 42 days. It would appear as if\r\nthe lacrymal glands required some practice in the individual before\r\nthey are easily excited into action, in somewhat the same manner as\r\nvarious inherited consensual movements and tastes require some exercise\r\nbefore they are fixed and perfected. This is all the more likely with a\r\nhabit like weeping, which must have been acquired since the period when\r\nman branched off from the common progenitor of the genus Homo and of\r\nthe non-weeping anthropomorphous apes.\r\n\r\nThe fact of tears not being shed at a very early age from pain or any\r\nmental emotion is remarkable, as, later in life, no expression is more\r\ngeneral or more strongly marked than weeping. When the habit has once\r\nbeen acquired by an infant, it expresses in the clearest manner\r\nsuffering of all kinds, both bodily pain and mental distress, even\r\nthough accompanied by other emotions, such as fear or rage. The\r\ncharacter of the crying, however, changes at a very early age, as I\r\nnoticed in my own infants,—the passionate cry differing from that of\r\ngrief. A lady informs me that her child, nine months old, when in a\r\npassion screams loudly, but does not weep; tears, however, are shed\r\nwhen she is punished by her chair being turned with its back to the\r\ntable. This difference may perhaps be attributed to weeping being\r\nrestrained, as we shall immediately see, at a more advanced age, under\r\nmost circumstances excepting grief; and to the influence of such\r\nrestraint being transmitted to an earlier period of life, than that at\r\nwhich it was first practised.\r\n\r\nWith adults, especially of the male sex, weeping soon ceases to be\r\ncaused by, or to express, bodily pain. This may be accounted for by its\r\nbeing thought weak and unmanly by men, both of civilized and barbarous\r\nraces, to exhibit bodily pain by any outward sign. With this exception,\r\nsavages weep copiously from very slight causes, of which fact Sir J.\r\nLubbock[608] has collected instances. A New Zealand chief “cried like a\r\nchild because the sailors spoilt his favourite cloak by powdering it\r\nwith flour.” I saw in Tierra del Fuego a native who had lately lost a\r\nbrother, and who alternately cried with hysterical violence, and\r\nlaughed heartily at anything which amused him. With the civilized\r\nnations of Europe there is also much difference in the frequency of\r\nweeping. Englishmen rarely cry, except under the pressure of the\r\nacutest grief; whereas in some parts of the Continent the men shed\r\ntears much more readily and freely.\r\n\r\nThe insane notoriously give way to all their emotions with little or no\r\nrestraint; and I am informed by Dr. J. Crichton Browne, that nothing is\r\nmore characteristic of simple melancholia, even in the male sex, than a\r\ntendency to weep on the slightest occasions, or from no cause. They\r\nalso weep disproportionately on the occurrence of any real cause of\r\ngrief. The length of time during which some patients weep is\r\nastonishing, as well as the amount of tears which they shed. One\r\nmelancholic girl wept for a whole day, and afterwards confessed to Dr.\r\nBrowne, that it was because she remembered that she had once shaved off\r\nher eyebrows to promote their growth. Many patients in the asylum sit\r\nfor a long time rocking themselves backwards and forwards; “and if\r\nspoken to, they stop their movements, purse up their eyes, depress the\r\ncorners of the mouth, and burst out crying.” In some of these cases,\r\nthe being spoken to or kindly greeted appears to suggest some fanciful\r\nand sorrowful notion; but in other cases an effort of any kind excites\r\nweeping, independently of any sorrowful idea. Patients suffering from\r\nacute mania likewise have paroxysms of violent crying or blubbering, in\r\nthe midst of their incoherent ravings. We must not, however, lay too\r\nmuch stress on the copious shedding of tears by the insane, as being\r\ndue to the lack of all restraint; for certain brain-diseases, as\r\nhemiplegia, brain-wasting, and senile decay, have a special tendency to\r\ninduce weeping. Weeping is common in the insane, even after a complete\r\nstate of fatuity has been reached and the power of speech lost. Persons\r\nborn idiotic likewise weep;[609] but it is said that this is not the\r\ncase with cretins.\r\n\r\nWeeping seems to be the primary and natural expression, as we see in\r\nchildren, of suffering of any kind, whether bodily pain short of\r\nextreme agony, or mental distress. But the foregoing facts and common\r\nexperience show us that a frequently repeated effort to restrain\r\nweeping, in association with certain states of the mind, does much in\r\nchecking the habit. On the other hand, it appears that the power of\r\nweeping can be increased through habit; thus the Rev. R. Taylor,[610]\r\nwho long resided in New Zealand, asserts that the women can voluntarily\r\nshed tears in abundance; they meet for this purpose to mourn for the\r\ndead, and they take pride in crying “in the most affecting manner.”\r\n\r\nA single effort of repression brought to bear on the lacrymal glands\r\ndoes little, and indeed seems often to lead to an opposite result. An\r\nold and experienced physician told me that he had always found that the\r\nonly means to check the occasional bitter weeping of ladies who\r\nconsulted him, and who themselves wished to desist, was earnestly to\r\nbeg them not to try, and to assure them that nothing would relieve them\r\nso much as prolonged and copious crying.\r\n\r\nThe screaming of infants consists of prolonged expirations, with short\r\nand rapid, almost spasmodic inspirations, followed at a somewhat more\r\nadvanced age by sobbing. According to Gratiolet,[611] the glottis is\r\nchiefly affected during the act of sobbing. This sound is heard “at the\r\nmoment when the inspiration conquers the resistance of the glottis, and\r\nthe air rushes into the chest.” But the whole act of respiration is\r\nlikewise spasmodic and violent. The shoulders are at the same time\r\ngenerally raised, as by this movement respiration is rendered easier.\r\nWith one of my infants, when seventy-seven days old, the inspirations\r\nwere so rapid and strong that they approached in character to sobbing;\r\nwhen 138 days old I first noticed distinct sobbing, which subsequently\r\nfollowed every bad crying-fit. The respiratory movements are partly\r\nvoluntary and partly involuntary, and I apprehend that sobbing is at\r\nleast in part due to children having some power to command after early\r\ninfancy their vocal organs and to stop their screams, but from having\r\nless power over their respiratory muscles, these continue for a time to\r\nact in an involuntary or spasmodic manner, after having been brought\r\ninto violent action. Sobbing seems to be peculiar to the human species;\r\nfor the keepers in the Zoological Gardens assure me that they have\r\nnever heard a sob from any kind of monkey; though monkeys often scream\r\nloudly whilst being chased and caught, and then pant for a long time.\r\nWe thus see that there is a close analogy between sobbing and the free\r\nshedding of tears; for with children, sobbing does not commence during\r\nearly infancy, but afterwards comes on rather suddenly and then follows\r\nevery bad crying-fit, until the habit is checked with advancing years.\r\n\r\n_On the cause of the contraction of the muscles round the eyes during\r\nscreaming_.—We have seen that infants and young children, whilst\r\nscreaming, invariably close their eyes firmly, by the contraction of\r\nthe surrounding muscles, so that the skin becomes wrinkled all around.\r\nWith older children, and even with adults, whenever there is violent\r\nand unrestrained crying, a tendency to the contraction of these same\r\nmuscles may be observed; though this is often checked in order not to\r\ninterfere with vision.\r\n\r\nSir C. Bell explains[612] this action in the following manner:—“During\r\nevery violent act of expiration, whether in hearty laughter, weeping,\r\ncoughing, or sneezing, the eyeball is firmly compressed by the fibres\r\nof the orbicularis; and this is a provision for supporting and\r\ndefending the vascular system of the interior of the eye from a\r\nretrograde impulse communicated to the blood in the veins at that time.\r\nWhen we contract the chest and expel the air, there is a retardation of\r\nthe blood in the veins of the neck and head; and in the more powerful\r\nacts of expulsion, the blood not only distends the vessels, but is even\r\nregurgitated into the minute branches. Were the eye not properly\r\ncompressed at that time, and a resistance given to the shock,\r\nirreparable injury might be inflicted on the delicate textures of the\r\ninterior of the eye.” He further adds, “If we separate the eyelids of a\r\nchild to examine the eye, while it cries and struggles with passion, by\r\ntaking off the natural support to the vascular system of the eye, and\r\nmeans of guarding it against the rush of blood then occurring, the\r\nconjunctiva becomes suddenly filled with blood, and the eyelids\r\neverted.”\r\n\r\nNot only are the muscles round the eyes strongly contracted, as Sir C.\r\nBell states and as I have often observed, during screaming, loud\r\nlaughter, coughing, and sneezing, but during several other analogous\r\nactions. A man contracts these muscles when he violently blows his\r\nnose. I asked one of my boys to shout as loudly as he possibly could,\r\nand as soon as he began, he firmly contracted his orbicular muscles; I\r\nobserved this repeatedly, and on asking him why he had every time so\r\nfirmly closed his eyes, I found that he was quite unaware of the fact:\r\nhe had acted instinctively or unconsciously.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, in order to lead to the contraction of these\r\nmuscles, that air should actually be expelled from the chest; it\r\nsuffices that the muscles of the chest and abdomen should contract with\r\ngreat force, whilst by the closure of the glottis no air escapes. In\r\nviolent vomiting or retching the diaphragm is made to descend by the\r\nchest being filled with air; it is then held in this position by the\r\nclosure of the glottis, “as well as by the contraction of its own\r\nfibres.”[613] The abdominal muscles now contract strongly upon the\r\nstomach, its proper muscles likewise contracting, and the contents are\r\nthus ejected. During each effort of vomiting “the head becomes greatly\r\ncongested, so that the features are red and swollen, and the large\r\nveins of the face and temples visibly dilated.” At the same time, as I\r\nknow from observation, the muscles round the eyes are strongly\r\ncontracted. This is likewise the case when the abdominal muscles act\r\ndownwards with unusual force in expelling the contents of the\r\nintestinal canal.\r\n\r\nThe greatest exertion of the muscles of the body, if those of the chest\r\nare not brought into strong action in expelling or compressing the air\r\nwithin the lungs, does not lead to the contraction of the muscles round\r\nthe eyes. I have observed my sons using great force in gymnastic\r\nexercises, as in repeatedly raising their suspended bodies by their\r\narms alone, and in lifting heavy weights from the ground, but there was\r\nhardly any trace of contraction in the muscles round the eyes.\r\n\r\nAs the contraction of these muscles for the protection of the eyes\r\nduring violent expiration is indirectly, as we shall hereafter see, a\r\nfundamental element in several of our most important expressions, I was\r\nextremely anxious to ascertain how far Sir C. Bell’s view could be\r\nsubstantiated. Professor Donders, of Utrecht,[614] well known as one of\r\nthe highest authorities in Europe on vision and on the structure of the\r\neye, has most kindly undertaken for me this investigation with the aid\r\nof the many ingenious mechanisms of modern science, and has published\r\nthe results.[615] He shows that during violent expiration the external,\r\nthe intra-ocular, and the retro-ocular vessels of the eye are all\r\naffected in two ways, namely by the increased pressure of the blood in\r\nthe arteries, and by the return of the blood in the veins being\r\nimpeded. It is, therefore, certain that both the arteries and the veins\r\nof the eye are more or less distended during violent expiration. The\r\nevidence in detail may be found in Professor Donders’ valuable memoir.\r\nWe see the effects on the veins of the head, in their prominence, and\r\nin the purple colour of the face of a man who coughs violently from\r\nbeing half choked. I may mention, on the same authority, that the whole\r\neye certainly advances a little during each violent expiration. This is\r\ndue to the dilatation of the retro-ocular vessels, and might have been\r\nexpected from the intimate connection of the eye and brain; the brain\r\nbeing known to rise and fall with each respiration, when a portion of\r\nthe skull has been removed; and as may be seen along the unclosed\r\nsutures of infants’ heads. This also, I presume, is the reason that the\r\neyes of a strangled man appear as if they were starting from their\r\nsockets.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the protection of the eye during violent expiratory\r\nefforts by the pressure of the eyelids, Professor Donders concludes\r\nfrom his various observations that this action certainly limits or\r\nentirely removes the dilatation of the vessels.[616] At such times, he\r\nadds, we not unfrequently see the hand involuntarily laid upon the\r\neyelids, as if the better to support and defend the eyeball.\r\n\r\nNevertheless much evidence cannot at present be advanced to prove that\r\nthe eye actually suffers injury from the want of support during violent\r\nexpiration; but there is some. It is “a fact that forcible expiratory\r\nefforts in violent coughing or vomiting, and especially in sneezing,\r\nsometimes give rise to ruptures of the little (external) vessels” of\r\nthe eye.[617] With respect to the internal vessels, Dr. Gunning has\r\nlately recorded a case of exophthalmos in consequence of\r\nwhooping-cough, which in his opinion depended on the rupture of the\r\ndeeper vessels; and another analogous case has been recorded. But a\r\nmere sense of discomfort would probably suffice to lead to the\r\nassociated habit of protecting the eyeball by the contraction of the\r\nsurrounding muscles. Even the expectation or chance of injury would\r\nprobably be sufficient, in the same manner as an object moving too near\r\nthe eye induces involuntary winking of the eyelids. We may, therefore,\r\nsafely conclude from Sir C. Bell’s observations, and more especially\r\nfrom the more careful investigations by Professor Donders, that the\r\nfirm closure of the eyelids during the screaming of children is an\r\naction full of meaning and of real service.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the contraction of the orbicular muscles\r\nleads to the drawing up of the upper lip, and consequently, if the\r\nmouth is kept widely open, to the drawing down of the corners by the\r\ncontraction of the depressor muscles. The formation of the naso-labial\r\nfold on the cheeks likewise follows from the drawing up of the upper\r\nlip. Thus all the chief expressive movements of the face during crying\r\napparently result from the contraction of the muscles round the eyes.\r\nWe shall also find that the shedding of tears depends on, or at least\r\nstands in some connection with, the contraction of these same muscles.\r\n\r\nIn some of the foregoing cases, especially in those of sneezing and\r\ncoughing, it is possible that the contraction of the orbicular muscles\r\nmay serve in addition to protect the eyes from too severe a jar or\r\nvibration. I think so, because dogs and cats, in crunching hard bones,\r\nalways close their eyelids, and at least sometimes in sneezing; though\r\ndogs do not do so whilst barking loudly. Mr. Sutton carefully observed\r\nfor me a young orang and chimpanzee, and he found that both always\r\nclosed their eyes in sneezing and coughing, but not whilst screaming\r\nviolently. I gave a small pinch of snuff to a monkey of the American\r\ndivision, namely, a Cebus, and it closed its eyelids whilst sneezing;\r\nbut not on a subsequent occasion whilst uttering loud cries.\r\n\r\n_Cause of the secretion of tears_.—It is an important fact which must\r\nbe considered in any theory of the secretion of tears from the mind\r\nbeing affected, that whenever the muscles round the eyes are strongly\r\nand involuntarily contracted in order to compress the blood-vessels and\r\nthus to protect the eyes, tears are secreted, often in sufficient\r\nabundance to roll down the cheeks. This occurs under the most opposite\r\nemotions, and under no emotion at all. The sole exception, and this is\r\nonly a partial one, to the existence of a relation between the\r\ninvoluntary and strong contraction of these muscles and the secretion\r\nof tears is that of young infants, who, whilst screaming violently with\r\ntheir eyelids firmly closed, do not commonly weep until they have\r\nattained the age of from two to three or four months. Their eyes,\r\nhowever, become suffused with tears at a much earlier age. It would\r\nappear, as already remarked, that the lacrymal glands do not, from the\r\nwant of practice or some other cause, come to full functional activity\r\nat a very early period of life. With children at a somewhat later age,\r\ncrying out or wailing from any distress is so regularly accompanied by\r\nthe shedding of tears, that weeping and crying are synonymous\r\nterms.[618]\r\n\r\nUnder the opposite emotion of great joy or amusement, as long as\r\nlaughter is moderate there is hardly any contraction of the muscles\r\nround the eyes, so that there is no frowning; but when peals of loud\r\nlaughter are uttered, with rapid and violent spasmodic expirations,\r\ntears stream down the face. I have more than once noticed the face of a\r\nperson, after a paroxysm of violent laughter, and I could see that the\r\norbicular muscles and those running to the upper lip were still\r\npartially contracted, which together with the tear-stained cheeks gave\r\nto the upper half of the face an expression not to be distinguished\r\nfrom that of a child still blubbering from grief. The fact of tears\r\nstreaming down the face during violent laughter is common to all the\r\nraces of mankind, as we shall see in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nIn violent coughing especially when a person is half-choked, the face\r\nbecomes purple, the veins distended, the orbicular muscles strongly\r\ncontracted, and tears run down the cheeks. Even after a fit of ordinary\r\ncoughing, almost every one has to wipe his eyes. In violent vomiting or\r\nretching, as I have myself experienced and seen in others, the\r\norbicular muscles are strongly contracted, and tears sometimes flow\r\nfreely down the cheeks. It has been suggested to me that this may be\r\ndue to irritating matter being injected into the nostrils, and causing\r\nby reflex action the secretion of tears. Accordingly I asked one of my\r\ninformants, a surgeon, to attend to the effects of retching when\r\nnothing was thrown up from the stomach; and, by an odd coincidence, he\r\nhimself suffered the next morning from an attack of retching, and three\r\ndays subsequently observed a lady under a similar attack; and he is\r\ncertain that in neither case an atom of matter was ejected from the\r\nstomach; yet the orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and tears\r\nfreely secreted. I can also speak positively to the energetic\r\ncontraction of these same muscles round the eyes, and to the coincident\r\nfree secretion of tears, when the abdominal muscles act with unusual\r\nforce in a downward direction on the intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nYawning commences with a deep inspiration, followed by a long and\r\nforcible expiration; and at the same time almost all the muscles of the\r\nbody are strongly contracted, including those round the eyes. During\r\nthis act tears are often secreted, and I have seen them even rolling\r\ndown the cheeks.\r\n\r\nI have frequently observed that when persons scratch some point which\r\nitches intolerably, they forcibly close their eyelids; but they do not,\r\nas I believe, first draw a deep breath and then expel it with force;\r\nand I have never noticed that the eyes then become filled with tears;\r\nbut I am not prepared to assert that this does not occur. The forcible\r\nclosure of the eyelids is, perhaps, merely a part of that general\r\naction by which almost all the muscles of the body are at the same time\r\nrendered rigid. It is quite different from the gentle closure of the\r\neyes which often accompanies, as Gratiolet remarks,[619] the smelling a\r\ndelicious odour, or the tasting a delicious morsel, and which probably\r\noriginates in the desire to shut out any disturbing impression through\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nProfessor Donders writes to me to the following effect: “I have\r\nobserved some cases of a very curious affection when, after a slight\r\nrub (_attouchement_), for example, from the friction of a coat, which\r\ncaused neither a wound nor a contusion, spasms of the orbicular muscles\r\noccurred, with a very profuse flow of tears, lasting about one hour.\r\nSubsequently, sometimes after an interval of several weeks, violent\r\nspasms of the same muscles re-occurred, accompanied by the secretion of\r\ntears, together with primary or secondary redness of the eye.” Mr.\r\nBowman informs me that he has occasionally observed closely analogous\r\ncases, and that, in some of these, there was no redness or inflammation\r\nof the eyes.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to ascertain whether there existed in any of the lower\r\nanimals a similar relation between the contraction of the orbicular\r\nmuscles during violent expiration and the secretion of tears; but there\r\nare very few animals which contract these muscles in a prolonged\r\nmanner, or which shed tears. _The Macacus maurus_, which formerly wept\r\nso copiously in the Zoological Gardens, would have been a fine case for\r\nobservation; but the two monkeys now there, and which are believed to\r\nbelong to the same species, do not weep. Nevertheless they were\r\ncarefully observed by Mr. Bartlett and myself, whilst screaming loudly,\r\nand they seemed to contract these muscles; but they moved about their\r\ncages so rapidly, that it was difficult to observe with certainty. No\r\nother monkey, as far as I have been able to ascertain, contracts its\r\norbicular muscles whilst screaming.\r\n\r\nThe Indian elephant is known sometimes to weep. Sir E. Tennent, in\r\ndescribing these which he saw captured and bound in Ceylon, says, some\r\n“lay motionless on the ground, with no other indication of suffering\r\nthan the tears which suffused their eyes and flowed incessantly.”\r\nSpeaking of another elephant he says, “When overpowered and made fast,\r\nhis grief was most affecting; his violence sank to utter prostration,\r\nand he lay on the ground, uttering choking cries, with tears trickling\r\ndown his cheeks.”[620] In the Zoological Gardens the keeper of the\r\nIndian elephants positively asserts that he has several times seen\r\ntears rolling down the face of the old female, when distressed by the\r\nremoval of the young one. Hence I was extremely anxious to ascertain,\r\nas an extension of the relation between the contraction of the\r\norbicular muscles and the shedding of tears in man, whether elephants\r\nwhen screaming or trumpeting loudly contract these muscles. At Mr.\r\nBartlett’s desire the keeper ordered the old and the young elephant to\r\ntrumpet; and we repeatedly saw in both animals that, just as the\r\ntrumpeting began, the orbicular muscles, especially the lower ones,\r\nwere distinctly contracted. On a subsequent occasion the keeper made\r\nthe old elephant trumpet much more loudly, and invariably both the\r\nupper and lower orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and now in\r\nan equal degree. It is a singular fact that the African elephant,\r\nwhich, however, is so different from the Indian species that it is\r\nplaced by some naturalists in a distinct sub-genus, when made on two\r\noccasions to trumpet loudly, exhibited no trace of the contraction of\r\nthe orbicular muscles.\r\n\r\nFrom the several foregoing cases with respect to Man, there can, I\r\nthink, be no doubt that the contraction of the muscles round the eyes,\r\nduring violent expiration or when the expanded chest is forcibly\r\ncompressed, is, in some manner, intimately connected with the secretion\r\nof tears. This holds good under widely different emotions, and\r\nindependently of any emotion. It is not, of course, meant that tears\r\ncannot be secreted without the contraction of these muscles; for it is\r\nnotorious that they are often freely shed with the eyelids not closed,\r\nand with the brows unwrinkled. The contraction must be both involuntary\r\nand prolonged, as during a choking fit, or energetic, as during a\r\nsneeze. The mere involuntary winking of the eyelids, though often\r\nrepeated, does not bring tears into the eyes. Nor does the voluntary\r\nand prolonged contraction of the several surrounding muscles suffice.\r\nAs the lacrymal glands of children are easily excited, I persuaded my\r\nown and several other children of different ages to contract these\r\nmuscles repeatedly with their utmost force, and to continue doing so as\r\nlong as they possibly could; but this produced hardly any effect. There\r\nwas sometimes a little moisture in the eyes, but not more than\r\napparently could be accounted for by the squeezing out of the already\r\nsecreted tears within the glands.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the relation between the involuntary and energetic\r\ncontraction of the muscles round the eyes, and the secretion of tears,\r\ncannot be positively ascertained, but a probable view may be suggested.\r\nThe primary function of the secretion of tears, together with some\r\nmucus, is to lubricate the surface of the eye; and a secondary one, as\r\nsome believe, is to keep the nostrils damp, so that the inhaled air may\r\nbe moist,[621] and likewise to favour the power of smelling. But\r\nanother, and at least equally important function of tears, is to wash\r\nout particles of dust or other minute objects which may get into the\r\neyes. That this is of great importance is clear from the cases in which\r\nthe cornea has been rendered opaque through inflammation, caused by\r\nparticles of dust not being removed, in consequence of the eye and\r\neyelid becoming immovable.[622] The secretion of tears from the\r\nirritation of any foreign body in the eye is a reflex action;—that is,\r\nthe body irritates a peripheral nerve which sends an impression to\r\ncertain sensory nerve-cells; these transmit an influence to other\r\ncells, and these again to the lacrymal glands. The influence\r\ntransmitted to these glands causes, as there is good reason to believe,\r\nthe relaxation of the muscular coats of the smaller arteries; this\r\nallows more blood to permeate the glandular tissue, and this induces a\r\nfree secretion of tears. When the small arteries of the face, including\r\nthose of the retina, are relaxed under very different circumstances,\r\nnamely, during an intense blush, the lacrymal glands are sometimes\r\naffected in a like manner, for the eyes become suffused with tears.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conjecture how many reflex actions have originated,\r\nbut, in relation to the present case of the affection of the lacrymal\r\nglands through irritation of the surface of the eye, it may be worth\r\nremarking that, as soon as some primordial form became semi-terrestrial\r\nin its habits, and was liable to get particles of dust into its eyes,\r\nif these were not washed out they would cause much irritation; and on\r\nthe principle of the radiation of nerve-force to adjoining nerve-cells,\r\nthe lacrymal glands would be stimulated to secretion. As this would\r\noften recur, and as nerve-force readily passes along accustomed\r\nchannels, a slight irritation would ultimately suffice to cause a free\r\nsecretion of tears.\r\n\r\nAs soon as by this, or by some other means, a reflex action of this\r\nnature had been established and rendered easy, other stimulants applied\r\nto the surface of the eye—such as a cold wind, slow inflammatory\r\naction, or a blow on the eyelids—would cause a copious secretion of\r\ntears, as we know to be the case. The glands are also excited into\r\naction through the irritation of adjoining parts. Thus when the\r\nnostrils are irritated by pungent vapours, though the eyelids may be\r\nkept firmly closed, tears are copiously secreted; and this likewise\r\nfollows from a blow on the nose, for instance from a boxing-glove. A\r\nstinging switch on the face produces, as I have seen, the same effect.\r\nIn these latter cases the secretion of tears is an incidental result,\r\nand of no direct service. As all these parts of the face, including the\r\nlacrymal glands, are supplied with branches of the same nerve, namely,\r\nthe fifth, it is in some degree intelligible that the effects of the\r\nexcitement of any one branch should spread to the nerve-cells or roots\r\nof the other branches.\r\n\r\nThe internal parts of the eye likewise act, under certain conditions,\r\nin a reflex manner on the lacrymal glands. The following statements\r\nhave been kindly communicated to me by Mr. Bowman; but the subject is a\r\nvery intricate one, as all the parts of the eye are so intimately\r\nrelated together, and are so sensitive to various stimulants. A strong\r\nlight acting on the retina, when in a normal condition, has very little\r\ntendency to cause lacrymation; but with unhealthy children having\r\nsmall, old-standing ulcers on the cornea, the retina becomes\r\nexcessively sensitive to light, and exposure even to common daylight\r\ncauses forcible and sustained closure of the lids, and a profuse flow\r\nof tears. When persons who ought to begin the use of convex glasses\r\nhabitually strain the waning power of accommodation, an undue secretion\r\nof tears very often follows, and the retina is liable to become unduly\r\nsensitive to light. In general, morbid affections of the surface of the\r\neye, and of the ciliary structures concerned in the accommodative act,\r\nare prone to be accompanied with excessive secretion of tears. Hardness\r\nof the eyeball, not rising to inflammation, but implying a want of\r\nbalance between the fluids poured out and again taken up by the\r\nintra-ocular vessels, is not usually attended with any lacrymation.\r\nWhen the balance is on the other side, and the eye becomes too soft,\r\nthere is a greater tendency to lacrymation. Finally, there are numerous\r\nmorbid states and structural alterations of the eyes, and even terrible\r\ninflammations, which may be attended with little or no secretion of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nIt also deserves notice, as indirectly bearing on our subject, that the\r\neye and adjoining parts are subject to an extraordinary number of\r\nreflex and associated movements, sensations, and actions, besides those\r\nrelating to the lacrymal glands. When a bright light strikes the retina\r\nof one eye alone, the iris contracts, but the iris of the other eye\r\nmoves after a measurable interval of time. The iris likewise moves in\r\naccommodation to near or distant vision, and when the two eyes are made\r\nto converge.[623] Every one knows how irresistibly the eyebrows are\r\ndrawn down under an intensely bright light. The eyelids also\r\ninvoluntarily wink when an object is moved near the eyes, or a sound is\r\nsuddenly heard. The well-known case of a bright light causing some\r\npersons to sneeze is even more curious; for nerve-force here radiates\r\nfrom certain nerve-cells in connection with the retina, to the sensory\r\nnerve-cells of the nose, causing it to tickle; and from these, to the\r\ncells which command the various respiratory muscles (the orbiculars\r\nincluded) which expel the air in so peculiar a manner that it rushes\r\nthrough the nostrils alone.\r\n\r\nTo return to our point: why are tears secreted during a screaming-fit\r\nor other violent expiratory efforts? As a slight blow on the eyelids\r\ncauses a copious secretion of tears, it is at least possible that the\r\nspasmodic contraction of the eyelids, by pressing strongly on the\r\neyeball, should in a similar manner cause some secretion. This seems\r\npossible, although the voluntary contraction of the same muscles does\r\nnot produce any such effect. We know that a man cannot voluntarily\r\nsneeze or cough with nearly the same force as he does automatically;\r\nand so it is with the contraction of the orbicular muscles: Sir C. Bell\r\nexperimented on them, and found that by suddenly and forcibly closing\r\nthe eyelids in the dark, sparks of light are seen, like those caused by\r\ntapping the eyelids with the fingers; “but in sneezing the compression\r\nis both more rapid and more forcible, and the sparks are more\r\nbrilliant.” That these sparks are due to the contraction of the eyelids\r\nis clear, because if they “are held open during the act of sneezing, no\r\nsensation of light will be experienced.” In the peculiar cases referred\r\nto by Professor Donders and Mr. Bowman, we have seen that some weeks\r\nafter the eye has been very slightly injured, spasmodic contractions of\r\nthe eyelids ensue, and these are accompanied by a profuse flow of\r\ntears. In the act of yawning, the tears are apparently due solely to\r\nthe spasmodic contraction of the muscles round the eyes.\r\nNotwithstanding these latter cases, it seems hardly credible that the\r\npressure of the eyelids on the surface of the eye, although effected\r\nspasmodically and therefore with much greater force than can be done\r\nvoluntarily, should be sufficient to cause by reflex action the\r\nsecretion of tears in the many cases in which this occurs during\r\nviolent expiratory efforts.\r\n\r\nAnother cause may come conjointly into play. We have seen that the\r\ninternal parts of the eye, under certain conditions act in a reflex\r\nmanner on the lacrymal glands. We know that during violent expiratory\r\nefforts the pressure of the arterial blood within the vessels of the\r\neye is increased, and that the return of the venous blood is impeded.\r\nIt seems, therefore, not improbable that the distension of the ocular\r\nvessels, thus induced, might act by reflection on the lacrymal\r\nglands—the effects due to the spasmodic pressure of the eyelids on the\r\nsurface of the eye being thus increased.\r\n\r\nIn considering how far this view is probable, we should bear in mind\r\nthat the eyes of infants have been acted on in this double manner\r\nduring numberless generations, whenever they have screamed; and on the\r\nprinciple of nerve-force readily passing along accustomed channels,\r\neven a moderate compression of the eyeballs and a moderate distension\r\nof the ocular vessels would ultimately come, through habit, to act on\r\nthe glands. We have an analogous case in the orbicular muscles being\r\nalmost always contracted in some slight degree, even during a gentle\r\ncrying-fit, when there can be no distension of the vessels and no\r\nuncomfortable sensation excited within the eyes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when complex actions or movements have long been performed in\r\nstrict association together, and these are from any cause at first\r\nvoluntarily and afterwards habitually checked, then if the proper\r\nexciting conditions occur, any part of the action or movement which is\r\nleast under the control of the will, will often still be involuntarily\r\nperformed. The secretion by a gland is remarkably free from the\r\ninfluence of the will; therefore, when with the advancing age of the\r\nindividual, or with the advancing culture of the race, the habit of\r\ncrying out or screaming is restrained, and there is consequently no\r\ndistension of the blood-vessels of the eye, it may nevertheless well\r\nhappen that tears should still be secreted. We may see, as lately\r\nremarked, the muscles round the eyes of a person who reads a pathetic\r\nstory, twitching or trembling in so slight a degree as hardly to be\r\ndetected. In this case there has been no screaming and no distension of\r\nthe blood-vessels, yet through habit certain nerve-cells send a small\r\namount of nerve-force to the cells commanding the muscles round the\r\neyes; and they likewise send some to the cells commanding the lacrymal\r\nglands, for the eyes often become at the same time just moistened with\r\ntears. If the twitching of the muscles round the eyes and the secretion\r\nof tears had been completely prevented, nevertheless it is almost\r\ncertain that there would have been some tendency to transmit\r\nnerve-force in these same directions; and as the lacrymal glands are\r\nremarkably free from the control of the will, they would be eminently\r\nliable still to act, thus betraying, though there were no other outward\r\nsigns, the pathetic thoughts which were passing through the person’s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAs a further illustration of the view here advanced, I may remark that\r\nif, during an early period of life, when habits of all kinds are\r\nreadily established, our infants, when pleased, had been accustomed to\r\nutter loud peals of laughter (during which the vessels of their eyes\r\nare distended) as often and as continuously as they have yielded when\r\ndistressed to screaming-fits, then it is probable that in after life\r\ntears would have been as copiously and as regularly secreted under the\r\none state of mind as under the other. Gentle laughter, or a smile, or\r\neven a pleasing thought, would have sufficed to cause a moderate\r\nsecretion of tears. There does indeed exist an evident tendency in this\r\ndirection, as will be seen in a future chapter, when we treat of the\r\ntender feelings. With the Sandwich Islanders, according to\r\nFreycinet,[624] tears are actually recognized as a sign of happiness;\r\nbut we should require better evidence on this head than that of a\r\npassing voyager. So again if our infants, during many generations, and\r\neach of them during several years, had almost daily suffered from\r\nprolonged choking-fits, during which the vessels of the eye are\r\ndistended and tears copiously secreted, then it is probable, such is\r\nthe force of associated habit, that during after life the mere thought\r\nof a choke, without any distress of mind, would have sufficed to bring\r\ntears into our eyes.\r\n\r\nTo sum up this chapter, weeping is probably the result of some such\r\nchain of events as follows. Children, when wanting food or suffering in\r\nany way, cry out loudly, like the young of most other animals, partly\r\nas a call to their parents for aid, and partly from any great exertion\r\nserving relief. Prolonged screaming inevitably leads to the gorging of\r\nthe blood-vessels of the eye; and this will have led, at first\r\nconsciously and at last habitually, to the contraction of the muscles\r\nround the eyes in order to protect them. At the same time the spasmodic\r\npressure on the surface of the eye, and the distension of the vessels\r\nwithin the eye, without necessarily entailing any conscious sensation,\r\nwill have affected, through reflex action, the lacrymal glands.\r\nFinally, through the three principles of nerve-force readily passing\r\nalong accustomed channels—of association, which is so widely extended\r\nin its power—and of certain actions, being more under the control of\r\nthe will than others—it has come to pass that suffering readily causes\r\nthe secretion of tears, without being necessarily accompanied by any\r\nother action.\r\n\r\nAlthough in accordance with this view we must look at weeping as an\r\nincidental result, as purposeless as the secretion of tears from a blow\r\noutside the eye, or as a sneeze from the retina being affected by a\r\nbright light, yet this does not present any difficulty in our\r\nunderstanding how the secretion of tears serves as a relief to\r\nsuffering. And by as much as the weeping is more violent or hysterical,\r\nby so much will the relief be greater,—on the same principle that the\r\nwrithing of the whole body, the grinding of the teeth, and the uttering\r\nof piercing shrieks, all give relief under an agony of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. LOW SPIRITS, ANXIETY, GRIEF, DEJECTION, DESPAIR.\r\n\r\nGeneral effect of grief on the system—Obliquity of the eyebrows under\r\nsuffering—On the cause of the obliquity of the eyebrows—On the\r\ndepression of the corners of the mouth.\r\n\r\nAfter the mind has suffered from an acute paroxysm of grief, and the\r\ncause still continues, we fall into a state of low spirits; or we may\r\nbe utterly cast down and dejected. Prolonged bodily pain, if not\r\namounting to an agony, generally leads to the same state of mind. If we\r\nexpect to suffer, we are anxious; if we have no hope of relief, we\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nPersons suffering from excessive grief often seek relief by violent and\r\nalmost frantic movements, as described in a former chapter; but when\r\ntheir suffering is somewhat mitigated, yet prolonged, they no longer\r\nwish for action, but remain motionless and passive, or may occasionally\r\nrock themselves to and fro. The circulation becomes languid; the face\r\npale; the muscles flaccid; the eyelids droop; the head hangs on the\r\ncontracted chest; the lips, cheeks, and lower jaw all sink downwards\r\nfrom their own weight. Hence all the features are lengthened; and the\r\nface of a person who hears bad news is said to fall. A party of natives\r\nin Tierra del Fuego endeavoured to explain to us that their friend, the\r\ncaptain of a sealing vessel, was out of spirits, by pulling down their\r\ncheeks with both hands, so as to make their faces as long as possible.\r\nMr. Bunnet informs me that the Australian aborigines when out of\r\nspirits have a chop-fallen appearance. After prolonged suffering the\r\neyes become dull and lack expression, and are often slightly suffused\r\nwith tears. The eyebrows not rarely are rendered oblique, which is due\r\nto their inner ends being raised. This produces peculiarly-formed\r\nwrinkles on the forehead, which are very different from those of a\r\nsimple frown; though in some cases a frown alone may be present. The\r\ncomers of the mouth are drawn downwards, which is so universally\r\nrecognized as a sign of being out of spirits, that it is almost\r\nproverbial.\r\n\r\nThe breathing becomes slow and feeble, and is often interrupted by deep\r\nsighs. As Gratiolet remarks, whenever our attention is long\r\nconcentrated on any subject, we forget to breathe, and then relieve\r\nourselves by a deep inspiration; but the sighs of a sorrowful person,\r\nowing to his slow respiration and languid circulation, are eminently\r\ncharacteristic.[701] As the grief of a person in this state\r\noccasionally recurs and increases into a paroxysm, spasms affect the\r\nrespiratory muscles, and he feels as if something, the so-called\r\n_globus hystericus_, was rising in his throat. These spasmodic\r\nmovements are clearly allied to the sobbing of children, and are\r\nremnants of those severer spasms which occur when a person is said to\r\nchoke from excessive grief.[702]\r\n\r\n_Obliquity of the eyebrows_.—Two points alone in the above description\r\nrequire further elucidation, and these are very curious ones; namely,\r\nthe raising of the inner ends of the eyebrows, and the drawing down of\r\nthe corners of the mouth. With respect to the eyebrows, they may\r\noccasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering\r\nfrom deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, I have observed this\r\nmovement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is\r\nsometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or\r\npretended distress. The eyebrows assume this position owing to the\r\ncontraction of certain muscles (namely, the orbiculars, corrugators,\r\nand pyramidals of the nose, which together tend to lower and contract\r\nthe eyebrows) being partially cheeked by the more powerful action of\r\nthe central fasciæ of the frontal muscle. These latter fasciæ by their\r\ncontraction raise the inner ends alone of the eyebrows; and as the\r\ncorrugators at the same time draw the eyebrows together, their inner\r\nends become puckered into a fold or lump. This fold is a highly\r\ncharacteristic point in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered\r\noblique, as may be seen in figs. 2 and 5, Plate II. The eyebrows are at\r\nthe same time somewhat roughened, owing to the hairs being made to\r\nproject. Dr. J. Crichton Browne has also often noticed in melancholic\r\npatients who keep their eyebrows persistently oblique, “a peculiar\r\nacute arching of the upper eyelid.” A trace of this may be observed by\r\ncomparing the right and left eyelids of the young man in the photograph\r\n(fig. 2, Plate II.); for he was not able to act equally on both\r\neyebrows. This is also shown by the unequal furrows on the two sides of\r\nhis forehead. The acute arching of the eyelids depends, I believe, on\r\nthe inner end alone of the eyebrows being raised; for when the whole\r\neyebrow is elevated and arched, the upper eyelid follows in a slight\r\ndegree the same movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Obliquity of the Eyebrows. Plate II\r\n\r\nBut the most conspicuous result of the opposed contraction of the\r\nabove-named muscles, is exhibited by the peculiar furrows formed on the\r\nforehead. These muscles, when thus in conjoint yet opposed action, may\r\nbe called, for the sake of brevity, the grief-muscles. When a person\r\nelevates his eyebrows by the contraction of the whole frontal muscle,\r\ntransverse wrinkles extend across the whole breadth of the forehead;\r\nbut in the present case the middle fasciae alone are contracted;\r\nconsequently, transverse furrows are formed across the middle part\r\nalone of the forehead. The skin over the exterior parts of both\r\neyebrows is at the same time drawn downwards and smooth, by the\r\ncontraction of the outer portions of the orbicular muscles. The\r\neyebrows are likewise brought together through the simultaneous\r\ncontraction of the corrugators;[703] and this latter action generates\r\nvertical furrows, separating the exterior and lowered part of the skin\r\nof the forehead from the central and raised part. The union of these\r\nvertical furrows with the central and transverse furrows (see figs. 2\r\nand 3) produces a mark on the forehead which has been compared to a\r\nhorse-shoe; but the furrows more strictly form three sides of a\r\nquadrangle. They are often conspicuous on the foreheads of adult or\r\nnearly adult persons, when their eyebrows are made oblique; but with\r\nyoung children, owing to their skin not easily wrinkling, they are\r\nrarely seen, or mere traces of them can be detected.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar furrows are best represented in fig. 3, Plate II., on\r\nthe forehead of a young lady who has the power in an unusual degree of\r\nvoluntarily acting on the requisite muscles. As she was absorbed in the\r\nattempt, whilst being photographed, her expression was not at all one\r\nof grief; I have therefore given the forehead alone. Fig. 1 on the same\r\nplate, copied from Dr. Duchenne’s work,[704] represents, on a reduced\r\nscale, the face, in its natural state, of a young man who was a good\r\nactor. In fig. 2 he is shown simulating grief, but the two eyebrows, as\r\nbefore remarked, are not equally acted on. That the expression is true,\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that out of fifteen persons, to whom the\r\noriginal photograph was shown, without any clue to what was intended\r\nbeing given them, fourteen immediately answered, “despairing sorrow,”\r\n“suffering endurance,” “melancholy,” and so forth. The history of fig.\r\n5 is rather curious: I saw the photograph in a shop-window, and took it\r\nto Mr. Rejlander for the sake of finding out by whom it had been made;\r\nremarking to him how pathetic the expression was. He answered, “I made\r\nit, and it was likely to be pathetic, for the boy in a few minutes\r\nburst out crying.” He then showed me a photograph of the same boy in a\r\nplacid state, which I have had (fig. 4) reproduced. In fig. 6, a trace\r\nof obliquity in the eyebrows may be detected; but this figure, as well\r\nas fig. 7, is given to show the depression of the corners of the mouth,\r\nto which subject I shall presently refer.\r\n\r\nFew persons, without some practice, can voluntarily act on their\r\ngrief-muscles; but after repeated trials a considerable number succeed,\r\nwhilst others never can. The degree of obliquity in the eyebrows,\r\nwhether assumed voluntarily or unconsciously, differs much in different\r\npersons. With some who apparently have unusually strong pyramidal\r\nmuscles, the contraction of the central fasciae of the frontal muscle,\r\nalthough it may be energetic, as shown by the quadrangular furrows on\r\nthe forehead, does not raise the inner ends of the eyebrows, but only\r\nprevents their being so much lowered as they otherwise would have been.\r\nAs far as I have been able to observe, the grief-muscles are brought\r\ninto action much more frequently by children and women than by men.\r\nThey are rarely acted on, at least with grown-up persons, from bodily\r\npain, but almost exclusively from mental distress. Two persons who,\r\nafter some practice, succeeded in acting on their grief-muscles, found\r\nby looking at a mirror that when they made their eyebrows oblique, they\r\nunintentionally at the same time depressed the corners of their mouths;\r\nand this is often the case when the expression is naturally assumed.\r\n\r\nThe power to bring the grief-muscles freely into play appears to be\r\nhereditary, like almost every other human faculty. A lady belonging to\r\na family famous for having produced an extraordinary number of great\r\nactors and actresses, and who can herself give this expression “with\r\nsingular precision,” told Dr. Crichton Browne that all her family had\r\npossessed the power in a remarkable degree. The same hereditary\r\ntendency is said to have extended, as I likewise hear from Dr. Browne,\r\nto the last descendant of the family, which gave rise to Sir Walter\r\nScott’s novel of ‘Red Gauntlet;’ but the hero is described as\r\ncontracting his forehead into a horseshoe mark from any strong emotion.\r\nI have also seen a young woman whose forehead seemed almost habitually\r\nthus contracted, independently of any emotion being at the time felt.\r\n\r\nThe grief-muscles are not very frequently brought into play; and as the\r\naction is often momentary, it easily escapes observation. Although the\r\nexpression, when observed, is universally and instantly recognized as\r\nthat of grief or anxiety, yet not one person out of a thousand who has\r\nnever studied the subject, is able to say precisely what change passes\r\nover the sufferer’s face. Hence probably it is that this expression is\r\nnot even alluded to, as far as I have noticed, in any work of fiction,\r\nwith the exception of ‘Red Gauntlet’ and of one other novel; and the\r\nauthoress of the latter, as I am informed, belongs to the famous family\r\nof actors just alluded to; so that her attention may have been\r\nspecially called to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek sculptors were familiar with the expression, as shown\r\nin the statues of the Laocoon and Arretino; but, as Duchenne remarks,\r\nthey carried the transverse furrows across the whole breadth of the\r\nforehead, and thus committed a great anatomical mistake: this is\r\nlikewise the case in some modern statues. It is, however, more probable\r\nthat these wonderfully accurate observers intentionally sacrificed\r\ntruth for the sake of beauty, than that they made a mistake; for\r\nrectangular furrows on the forehead would not have had a grand\r\nappearance on the marble. The expression, in its fully developed\r\ncondition, is, as far as I can discover, not often represented in\r\npictures by the old masters, no doubt owing to the same cause; but a\r\nlady who is perfectly familiar with this expression, informs me that in\r\nFra Angelico’s ‘Descent from the Cross’ in Florence, it is clearly\r\nexhibited in one of the figures on the right-hand; and I could add a\r\nfew other instances.\r\n\r\nDr. Crichton Browne, at my request, closely attended to this expression\r\nin the numerous insane patients under his care in the West Riding\r\nAsylum; and he is familiar with Duchenne’s photographs of the action of\r\nthe grief-muscles. He informs me that they may constantly be seen in\r\nenergetic action in cases of melancholia, and especially of\r\nhypochondria; and that the persistent lines or furrows, due to their\r\nhabitual contraction, are characteristic of the physiognomy of the\r\ninsane belonging to these two classes. Dr. Browne carefully observed\r\nfor me during a considerable period three cases of hypochondria, in\r\nwhich the grief-muscles were persistently contracted. In one of these,\r\na widow, aged 51, fancied that she had lost all her viscera, and that\r\nher whole body was empty. She wore an expression of great distress, and\r\nbeat her semi-closed hands rhythmically together for hours. The\r\ngrief-muscles were permanently contracted, and the upper eyelids\r\narched. This condition lasted for months; she then recovered, and her\r\ncountenance resumed its natural expression. A second case presented\r\nnearly the same peculiarities, with the addition that the comers of the\r\nmouth were depressed.\r\n\r\nMr. Patrick Nicol has also kindly observed for me several cases in the\r\nSussex Lunatic Asylum, and has communicated to me full details with\r\nrespect to three of them; but they need not here be given. From his\r\nobservations on melancholic patients, Mr. Nicol concludes that the\r\ninner ends of the eyebrows are almost always more or less raised, with\r\nthe wrinkles on the forehead more or less plainly marked. In the case\r\nof one young woman, these wrinkles were observed to be in constant\r\nslight play or movement. In some cases the comers of the mouth are\r\ndepressed, but often only in a slight degree. Some amount of difference\r\nin the expression of the several melancholic patients could almost\r\nalways be observed. The eyelids generally droop; and the skin near\r\ntheir outer comers and beneath them is wrinkled. The naso-labial fold,\r\nwhich runs from the wings of the nostrils to the comers of the mouth,\r\nand which is so conspicuous in blubbering children, is often plainly\r\nmarked in these patients.\r\n\r\nAlthough with the insane the grief-muscles often act persistently; yet\r\nin ordinary cases they are sometimes brought unconsciously into\r\nmomentary action by ludicrously slight causes. A gentleman rewarded a\r\nyoung lady by an absurdly small present; she pretended to be offended,\r\nand as she upbraided him, her eyebrows became extremely oblique, with\r\nthe forehead properly wrinkled. Another young lady and a youth, both in\r\nthe highest spirits, were eagerly talking together with extraordinary\r\nrapidity; and I noticed that, as often as the young lady was beaten,\r\nand could not get out her words fast enough, her eyebrows went\r\nobliquely upwards, and rectangular furrows were formed on her forehead.\r\nShe thus each time hoisted a flag of distress; and this she did\r\nhalf-a-dozen times in the course of a few minutes. I made no remark on\r\nthe subject, but on a subsequent occasion I asked her to act on her\r\ngrief-muscles; another girl who was present, and who could do so\r\nvoluntarily, showing her what was intended. She tried repeatedly, but\r\nutterly failed; yet so slight a cause of distress as not being able to\r\ntalk quickly enough, sufficed to bring these muscles over and over\r\nagain into energetic action.\r\n\r\nThe expression of grief, due to the contraction of the grief-muscles,\r\nis by no means confined to Europeans, but appears to be common to all\r\nthe races of mankind. I have, at least, received trustworthy accounts\r\nin regard to Hindoos, Dhangars (one of the aboriginal hill-tribes of\r\nIndia, and therefore belonging to a quite distinct race from the\r\nHindoos), Malays, Negroes and Australians. With respect to the latter,\r\ntwo observers answer my query in the affirmative, but enter into no\r\ndetails. Mr. Taplin, however, appends to my descriptive remarks the\r\nwords “this is exact.” With respect to negroes, the lady who told me of\r\nFra Angelico’s picture, saw a negro towing a boat on the Nile, and as\r\nhe encountered an obstruction, she observed his grief-muscles in strong\r\naction, with the middle of the forehead well wrinkled. Mr. Geach\r\nwatched a Malay man in Malacca, with the comers of his mouth much\r\ndepressed, the eyebrows oblique, with deep short grooves on the\r\nforehead. This expression lasted for a very short time; and Mr. Geach\r\nremarks it “was a strange one, very much like a person about to cry at\r\nsome great loss.”\r\n\r\nIn India Mr. H. Erskine found that the natives were familiar with this\r\nexpression; and Mr. J. Scott, of the Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, has\r\nobligingly sent me a full description of two cases. He observed during\r\nsome time, himself unseen, a very young Dhangar woman from Nagpore, the\r\nwife of one of the gardeners, nursing her baby who was at the point of\r\ndeath; and he distinctly saw the eyebrows raised at the inner comers,\r\nthe eyelids drooping, the forehead wrinkled in the middle, the mouth\r\nslightly open, with the comers much depressed. He then came from behind\r\na screen of plants and spoke to the poor woman, who started, burst into\r\na bitter flood of tears, and besought him to cure her baby. The second\r\ncase was that of a Hindustani man, who from illness and poverty was\r\ncompelled to sell his favourite goat. After receiving the money, he\r\nrepeatedly looked at the money in his hand and then at the goat, as if\r\ndoubting whether he would not return it. He went to the goat, which was\r\ntied up ready to be led away, and the animal reared up and licked his\r\nhands. His eyes then wavered from side to side; his “mouth was\r\npartially closed, with the corners very decidedly depressed.” At last\r\nthe poor man seemed to make up his mind that he must part with his\r\ngoat, and then, as Mr. Scott saw, the eyebrows became slightly oblique,\r\nwith the characteristic puckering or swelling at the inner ends, but\r\nthe wrinkles on the forehead were not present. The man stood thus for a\r\nminute, then heaving a deep sigh, burst into tears, raised up his two\r\nhands, blessed the goat, turned round, and without looking again, went\r\naway.\r\n\r\n_On the cause of the obliquity of the eyebrows under suffering_.—During\r\nseveral years no expression seemed to me so utterly perplexing as this\r\nwhich we are here considering. Why should grief or anxiety cause the\r\ncentral fasciae alone of the frontal muscle together with those round\r\nthe eyes, to contract? Here we seem to have a complex movement for the\r\nsole purpose of expressing grief; and yet it is a comparatively rare\r\nexpression, and often overlooked. I believe the explanation is not so\r\ndifficult as it at first appears. Dr. Duchenne gives a photograph of\r\nthe young man before referred to, who, when looking upwards at a\r\nstrongly illuminated surface, involuntarily contracted his\r\ngrief-muscles in an exaggerated manner. I had entirely forgotten this\r\nphotograph, when on a very bright day with the sun behind me, I met,\r\nwhilst on horseback, a girl whose eyebrows, as she looked up at me,\r\nbecame extremely oblique, with the proper furrows on her forehead. I\r\nhave observed the same movement under similar circumstances on several\r\nsubsequent occasions. On my return home I made three of my children,\r\nwithout giving them any clue to my object, look as long and as\r\nattentively as they could, at the summit of a tall tree standing\r\nagainst an extremely bright sky. With all three, the orbicular,\r\ncorrugator, and pyramidal muscles were energetically contracted,\r\nthrough reflex action, from the excitement of the retina, so that their\r\neyes might be protected from the bright light. But they tried their\r\nutmost to look upwards; and now a curious struggle, with spasmodic\r\ntwitchings, could be observed between the whole or only the central\r\nportion of the frontal muscle, and the several muscles which serve to\r\nlower the eyebrows and close the eyelids. The involuntary contraction\r\nof the pyramidal caused the basal part of their noses to be\r\ntransversely and deeply wrinkled. In one of the three children, the\r\nwhole eyebrows were momentarily raised and lowered by the alternate\r\ncontraction of the whole frontal muscle and of the muscles surrounding\r\nthe eyes, so that the whole breadth of the forehead was alternately\r\nwrinkled and smoothed. In the other two children the forehead became\r\nwrinkled in the middle part alone, rectangular furrows being thus\r\nproduced; and the eyebrows were rendered oblique, with their inner\r\nextremities puckered and swollen,—in the one child in a slight degree,\r\nin the other in a strongly marked manner. This difference in the\r\nobliquity of the eyebrows apparently depended on a difference in their\r\ngeneral mobility, and in the strength of the pyramidal muscles. In both\r\nthese cases the eyebrows and forehead were acted on under the influence\r\nof a strong light, in precisely the same manner, in every\r\ncharacteristic detail, as under the influence of grief or anxiety.\r\n\r\nDuchenne states that the pyramidal muscle of the nose is less under the\r\ncontrol of the will than are the other muscles round the eyes. He\r\nremarks that the young man who could so well act on his grief-muscles,\r\nas well as on most of his other facial muscles, could not contract the\r\npyramidals.[705] This power, however, no doubt differs in different\r\npersons. The pyramidal muscle serves to draw down the skin of the\r\nforehead between the eyebrows, together with their inner extremities.\r\nThe central fasciae of the frontal are the antagonists of the\r\npyramidal; and if the action of the latter is to be specially checked,\r\nthese central fasciae must be contracted. So that with persons having\r\npowerful pyramidal muscles, if there is under the influence of a bright\r\nlight an unconscious desire to prevent the lowering of the eyebrows,\r\nthe central fasciae of the frontal muscle must be brought into play;\r\nand their contraction, if sufficiently strong to overmaster the\r\npyramidals, together with the contraction of the corrugator and\r\norbicular muscles, will act in the manner just described on the\r\neyebrows and forehead.\r\n\r\nWhen children scream or cry out, they contract, as we know, the\r\norbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles, primarily for the sake of\r\ncompressing their eyes, and thus protecting them from being gorged with\r\nblood, and secondarily through habit. I therefore expected to find with\r\nchildren, that when they endeavoured either to prevent a crying-fit\r\nfrom coming on, or to stop crying, they would cheek the contraction of\r\nthe above-named muscles, in the same manner as when looking upwards at\r\na bright light; and consequently that the central fasciae of the\r\nfrontal muscle would often be brought into play. Accordingly, I began\r\nmyself to observe children at such times, and asked others, including\r\nsome medical men, to do the same. It is necessary to observe carefully,\r\nas the peculiar opposed action of these muscles is not nearly so plain\r\nin children, owing to their foreheads not easily wrinkling, as in\r\nadults. But I soon found that the grief-muscles were very frequently\r\nbrought into distinct action on these occasions. It would be\r\nsuperfluous to give all the cases which have been observed; and I will\r\nspecify only a few. A little girl, a year and a half old, was teased by\r\nsome other children, and before bursting into tears her eyebrows became\r\ndecidedly oblique. With an older girl the same obliquity was observed,\r\nwith the inner ends of the eyebrows plainly puckered; and at the same\r\ntime the corners of the mouth were drawn downwards. As soon as she\r\nburst into tears, the features all changed and this peculiar expression\r\nvanished. Again, after a little boy had been vaccinated, which made him\r\nscream and cry violently, the surgeon gave him an orange brought for\r\nthe purpose, and this pleased the child much; as he stopped crying all\r\nthe characteristic movements were observed, including the formation of\r\nrectangular wrinkles in the middle of the forehead. Lastly, I met on\r\nthe road a little girl three or four years old, who had been frightened\r\nby a dog, and when I asked her what was the matter, she stopped\r\nwhimpering, and her eyebrows instantly became oblique to an\r\nextraordinary degree.\r\n\r\nHere then, as I cannot doubt, we have the key to the problem why the\r\ncentral fasciae of the frontal muscle and the muscles round the eyes\r\ncontract in opposition to each other under the influence of\r\ngrief;—whether their contraction be prolonged, as with the melancholic\r\ninsane, or momentary, from some trifling cause of distress. We have all\r\nof us, as infants, repeatedly contracted our orbicular, corrugator, and\r\npyramidal muscles, in order to protect our eyes whilst screaming; our\r\nprogenitors before us have done the same during many generations; and\r\nthough with advancing years we easily prevent, when feeling distressed,\r\nthe utterance of screams, we cannot from long habit always prevent a\r\nslight contraction of the above-named muscles; nor indeed do we observe\r\ntheir contraction in ourselves, or attempt to stop it, if slight. But\r\nthe pyramidal muscles seem to be less under the command of the will\r\nthan the other related muscles; and if they be well developed, their\r\ncontraction can be checked only by the antagonistic contraction of the\r\ncentral fasciae of the frontal muscle. The result which necessarily\r\nfollows, if these fasciae contract energetically, is the oblique\r\ndrawing up of the eyebrows, the puckering of their inner ends, and the\r\nformation of rectangular furrows on the middle of the forehead. As\r\nchildren and women cry much more freely than men, and as grown-up\r\npersons of both sexes rarely weep except from mental distress, we can\r\nunderstand why the grief-muscles are more frequently seen in action, as\r\nI believe to be the case, with children and women than with men; and\r\nwith adults of both sexes from mental distress alone. In some of the\r\ncases before recorded, as in that of the poor Dhangar woman and of the\r\nHindustani man, the action of the grief-muscles was quickly followed by\r\nbitter weeping. In all cases of distress, whether great or small, our\r\nbrains tend through long habit to send an order to certain muscles to\r\ncontract, as if we were still infants on the point of screaming out;\r\nbut this order we, by the wondrous power of the will, and through\r\nhabit, are able partially to counteract; although this is effected\r\nunconsciously, as far as the means of counteraction are concerned.\r\n\r\n_On the depression of the corners of the mouth_.—This action is\r\neffected by the _depressores anguili oris_ (see letter K in figs. 1 and\r\n2). The fibres of this muscle diverge downwards, with the upper\r\nconvergent ends attached round the angles of the mouth, and to the\r\nlower lip a little way within the angles.[706] Some of the fibres\r\nappear to be antagonistic to the great zygomatic muscle, and others to\r\nthe several muscles running to the outer part of the upper lip. The\r\ncontraction of this muscle draws downwards and outwards the corners of\r\nthe mouth, including the outer part of the upper lip, and even in a\r\nslight degree the wings of the nostrils. When the mouth is closed and\r\nthis muscle acts, the commissure or line of junction of the two lips\r\nforms a curved line with the concavity downwards,[707] and the lips\r\nthemselves are generally somewhat protruded, especially the lower one.\r\nThe mouth in this state is well represented in the two photographs\r\n(Plate II., figs. 6 and 7) by Mr. Rejlander. The upper boy (fig. 6) had\r\njust stopped crying, after receiving a slap on the face from another\r\nboy; and the right moment was seized for photographing him.\r\n\r\nThe expression of low spirits, grief or dejection, due to the\r\ncontraction of this muscle has been noticed by every one who has\r\nwritten on the subject. To say that a person “is down in the mouth,” is\r\nsynonymous with saying that he is out of spirits. The depression of the\r\ncorners may often be seen, as already stated on the authority of Dr.\r\nCrichton Browne and Mr. Nicol, with the melancholic insane, and was\r\nwell exhibited in some photographs sent to me by the former gentleman,\r\nof patients with a strong tendency to suicide. It has been observed\r\nwith men belonging to various races, namely with Hindoos, the dark\r\nhill-tribes of India, Malays, and, as the Rev. Mr. Hagenauer informs\r\nme, with the aborigines of Australia.\r\n\r\nWhen infants scream they firmly contract the muscles round their eyes,\r\nand this draws up the upper lip; and as they have to keep their mouths\r\nwidely open, the depressor muscles running to the corners are likewise\r\nbrought into strong action. This generally, but not invariably, causes\r\na slight angular bend in the lower lip on both sides, near the corners\r\nof the mouth. The result of the upper and lower lip being thus acted on\r\nis that the mouth assumes a squarish outline. The contraction of the\r\ndepressor muscle is best seen in infants when not screaming violently,\r\nand especially just before they begin, or when they cease to scream.\r\nTheir little faces then acquire an extremely piteous expression, as I\r\ncontinually observed with my own infants between the ages of about six\r\nweeks and two or three months. Sometimes, when they are struggling\r\nagainst a crying-fit, the outline of the mouth is curved in so\r\nexaggerated a manner as to be like a horseshoe; and the expression of\r\nmisery then becomes a ludicrous caricature.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the contraction of this muscle, under the influence\r\nof low spirits or dejection, apparently follows from the same general\r\nprinciples as in the case of the obliquity of the eyebrows. Dr.\r\nDuchenne informs me that he concludes from his observations, now\r\nprolonged during many years, that this is one of the facial muscles\r\nwhich is least under the control of the will. This fact may indeed be\r\ninferred from what has just been stated with respect to infants when\r\ndoubtfully beginning to cry, or endeavouring to stop crying; for they\r\nthen generally command all the other facial muscles more effectually\r\nthan they do the depressors of the corners of the mouth. Two excellent\r\nobservers who had no theory on the subject, one of them a surgeon,\r\ncarefully watched for me some older children and women as with some\r\nopposed struggling they very gradually approached the point of bursting\r\nout into tears; and both observers felt sure that the depressors began\r\nto act before any of the other muscles. Now as the depressors have been\r\nrepeatedly brought into strong action during infancy in many\r\ngenerations, nerve-force will tend to flow, on the principle of long\r\nassociated habit, to these muscles as well as to various other facial\r\nmuscles, whenever in after life even a slight feeling of distress is\r\nexperienced. But as the depressors are somewhat less under the control\r\nof the will than most of the other muscles, we might expect that they\r\nwould often slightly contract, whilst the others remained passive. It\r\nis remarkable how small a depression of the corners of the mouth gives\r\nto the countenance an expression of low spirits or dejection, so that\r\nan extremely slight contraction of these muscles would be sufficient to\r\nbetray this state of mind.\r\n\r\nI may here mention a trifling observation, as it will serve to sum up\r\nour present subject. An old lady with a comfortable but absorbed\r\nexpression sat nearly opposite to me in a railway carriage. Whilst I\r\nwas looking at her, I saw that her _depressores anguli oris_ became\r\nvery slightly, yet decidedly, contracted; but as her countenance\r\nremained as placid as ever, I reflected how meaningless was this\r\ncontraction, and how easily one might be deceived. The thought had\r\nhardly occurred to me when I saw that her eyes suddenly became suffused\r\nwith tears almost to overflowing, and her whole countenance fell. There\r\ncould now be no doubt that some painful recollection, perhaps that of a\r\nlong-lost child, was passing through her mind. As soon as her sensorium\r\nwas thus affected, certain nerve-cells from long habit instantly\r\ntransmitted an order to all the respiratory muscles, and to those round\r\nthe mouth, to prepare for a fit of crying. But the order was\r\ncountermanded by the will, or rather by a later acquired habit, and all\r\nthe muscles were obedient, excepting in a slight degree the\r\n_depressores anguli oris_. The mouth was not even opened; the\r\nrespiration was not hurried; and no muscle was affected except those\r\nwhich draw down the corners of the mouth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mouth of this lady began, involuntarily and\r\nunconsciously on her part, to assume the proper form for a crying-fit,\r\nwe may feel almost sure that some nerve-influence would have been\r\ntransmitted through the long accustomed channels to the various\r\nrespiratory muscles, as well as to those round the eyes, and to the\r\nvaso-motor centre which governs the supply of blood sent to the\r\nlacrymal glands. Of this latter fact we have indeed clear evidence in\r\nher eyes becoming slightly suffused with tears; and we can understand\r\nthis, as the lacrymal glands are less under the control of the will\r\nthan the facial muscles. No doubt there existed at the same time some\r\ntendency in the muscles round the eyes at contract, as if for the sake\r\nof protecting them from being gorged with blood, but this contraction\r\nwas completely overmastered, and her brow remained unruffled. Had the\r\npyramidal, corrugator, and orbicular muscles been as little obedient to\r\nthe will, as they are in many persons, they would have been slightly\r\nacted on; and then the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would have\r\ncontracted in antagonism, and her eyebrows would have become oblique,\r\nwith rectangular furrows on her forehead. Her countenance would then\r\nhave expressed still more plainly than it did a state of dejection, or\r\nrather one of grief.\r\n\r\nThrough steps such as these we can understand how it is, that as soon\r\nas some melancholy thought passes through the brain, there occurs a\r\njust perceptible drawing down of the corners of the mouth, or a slight\r\nraising up of the inner ends of the eyebrows, or both movements\r\ncombined, and immediately afterwards a slight suffusion of tears. A\r\nthrill of nerve-force is transmitted along several habitual channels,\r\nand produces an effect on any point where the will has not acquired\r\nthrough long habit much power of interference. The above actions may be\r\nconsidered as rudimental vestiges of the screaming-fits, which are so\r\nfrequent and prolonged during infancy. In this case, as well as in many\r\nothers, the links are indeed wonderful which connect cause and effect\r\nin giving rise to various expressions on the human countenance; and\r\nthey explain to us the meaning of certain movements, which we\r\ninvoluntarily and unconsciously perform, whenever certain transitory\r\nemotions pass through our minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. JOY, HIGH SPIRITS, LOVE, TENDER FEELINGS, DEVOTION.\r\n\r\nLaughter primarily the expression of joy—Ludicrous ideas—Movements of\r\nthe features during laughter—Nature of the sound produced—The secretion\r\nof tears during loud laughter—Gradation from loud laughter to gentle\r\nsmiling—High spirits—The expression of love—Tender feelings—Devotion.\r\n\r\nJoy, when intense, leads to various purposeless movements—to dancing\r\nabout, clapping the hands, stamping, &c., and to loud laughter.\r\nLaughter seems primarily to be the expression of mere joy or happiness.\r\nWe clearly see this in children at play, who are almost incessantly\r\nlaughing. With young persons past childhood, when they are in high\r\nspirits, there is always much meaningless laughter. The laughter of the\r\ngods is described by Homer as “the exuberance of their celestial joy\r\nafter their daily banquet.” A man smiles—and smiling, as we shall see,\r\ngraduates into laughter—at meeting an old friend in the street, as he\r\ndoes at any trifling pleasure, such as smelling a sweet perfume.[801]\r\nLaura Bridgman, from her blindness and deafness, could not have\r\nacquired any expression through imitation, yet when a letter from a\r\nbeloved friend was communicated to her by gesture-language, she\r\n“laughed and clapped her hands, and the colour mounted to her cheeks.”\r\nOn other occasions she has been seen to stamp for joy.[802]\r\n\r\nIdiots and imbecile persons likewise afford good evidence that laughter\r\nor smiling primarily expresses mere happiness or joy. Dr. Crichton\r\nBrowne, to whom, as on so many other occasions, I am indebted for the\r\nresults of his wide experience, informs me that with idiots laughter is\r\nthe most prevalent and frequent of all the emotional expressions. Many\r\nidiots are morose, passionate, restless, in a painful state of mind, or\r\nutterly stolid, and these never laugh. Others frequently laugh in a\r\nquite senseless manner. Thus an idiot boy, incapable of speech,\r\ncomplained to Dr. Browne, by the aid of signs, that another boy in the\r\nasylum had given him a black eye; and this was accompanied by\r\n“explosions of laughter and with his face covered with the broadest\r\nsmiles.” There is another large class of idiots who are persistently\r\njoyous and benign, and who are constantly laughing or smiling.[803]\r\nTheir countenances often exhibit a stereotyped smile; their joyousness\r\nis increased, and they grin, chuckle, or giggle, whenever food is\r\nplaced before them, or when they are caressed, are shown bright\r\ncolours, or hear music. Some of them laugh more than usual when they\r\nwalk about, or attempt any muscular exertion. The joyousness of most of\r\nthese idiots cannot possibly be associated, as Dr. Browne remarks, with\r\nany distinct ideas: they simply feel pleasure, and express it by\r\nlaughter or smiles. With imbeciles rather higher in the scale, personal\r\nvanity seems to be the commonest cause of laughter, and next to this,\r\npleasure arising from the approbation of their conduct.\r\n\r\nWith grown-up persons laughter is excited by causes considerably\r\ndifferent from those which suffice during childhood; but this remark\r\nhardly applies to smiling. Laughter in this respect is analogous with\r\nweeping, which with adults is almost confined to mental distress,\r\nwhilst with children it is excited by bodily pain or any suffering, as\r\nwell as by fear or rage. Many curious discussions have been written on\r\nthe causes of laughter with grown-up persons. The subject is extremely\r\ncomplex. Something incongruous or unaccountable, exciting surprise and\r\nsome sense of superiority in the laugher, who must be in a happy frame\r\nof mind, seems to be the commonest cause.[804] The circumstances must\r\nnot be of a momentous nature: no poor man would laugh or smile on\r\nsuddenly hearing that a large fortune had been bequeathed to him. If\r\nthe mind is strongly excited by pleasurable feelings, and any little\r\nunexpected event or thought occurs, then, as Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\nremarks,[805] “a large amount of nervous energy, instead of being\r\nallowed to expend itself in producing an equivalent amount of the new\r\nthoughts and emotion which were nascent, is suddenly checked in its\r\nflow.”... “The excess must discharge itself in some other direction,\r\nand there results an efflux through the motor nerves to various classes\r\nof the muscles, producing the half-convulsive actions we term\r\nlaughter.” An observation, bearing on this point, was made by a\r\ncorrespondent during the recent siege of Paris, namely, that the German\r\nsoldiers, after strong excitement from exposure to extreme danger, were\r\nparticularly apt to burst out into loud laughter at the smallest joke.\r\nSo again when young children are just beginning to cry, an unexpected\r\nevent will sometimes suddenly turn their crying into laughter, which\r\napparently serves equally well to expend their superfluous nervous\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea;\r\nand this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with\r\nthat of the body. Every one knows how immoderately children laugh, and\r\nhow their whole bodies are convulsed when they are tickled. The\r\nanthropoid apes, as we have seen, likewise utter a reiterated sound,\r\ncorresponding with our laughter, when they are tickled, especially\r\nunder the armpits. I touched with a bit of paper the sole of the foot\r\nof one of my infants, when only seven days old, and it was suddenly\r\njerked away and the toes curled about, as in an older child. Such\r\nmovements, as well as laughter from being tickled, are manifestly\r\nreflex actions; and this is likewise shown by the minute unstriped\r\nmuscles, which serve to erect the separate hairs on the body,\r\ncontracting near a tickled surface.[806] Yet laughter from a ludicrous\r\nidea, though involuntary, cannot be called a strictly reflex action. In\r\nthis case, and in that of laughter from being tickled, the mind must be\r\nin a pleasurable condition; a young child, if tickled by a strange man,\r\nwould scream from fear. The touch must be light, and an idea or event,\r\nto be ludicrous, must not be of grave import. The parts of the body\r\nwhich are most easily tickled are those which are not commonly touched,\r\nsuch as the armpits or between the toes, or parts such as the soles of\r\nthe feet, which are habitually touched by a broad surface; but the\r\nsurface on which we sit offers a marked exception to this rule.\r\nAccording to Gratiolet,[807] certain nerves are much more sensitive to\r\ntickling than others. From the fact that a child can hardly tickle\r\nitself, or in a much less degree than when tickled by another person,\r\nit seems that the precise point to be touched must not be known; so\r\nwith the mind, something unexpected—a novel or incongruous idea which\r\nbreaks through an habitual train of thought—appears to be a strong\r\nelement in the ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThe sound of laughter is produced by a deep inspiration followed by\r\nshort, interrupted, spasmodic contractions of the chest, and especially\r\nof the diaphragm.[808] Hence we hear of “laughter holding both his\r\nsides.” From the shaking of the body, the head nods to and fro. The\r\nlower jaw often quivers up and down, as is likewise the case with some\r\nspecies of baboons, when they are much pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModerate Laughter and Smiling. Plate III\r\n\r\nDuring laughter the mouth is opened more or less widely, with the\r\ncorners drawn much backwards, as well as a little upwards; and the\r\nupper lip is somewhat raised. The drawing back of the corners is best\r\nseen in moderate laughter, and especially in a broad smile—the latter\r\nepithet showing how the mouth is widened. In the accompanying figs.\r\n1-3, Plate III., different degrees of moderate laughter and smiling\r\nhave been photographed. The figure of the little girl, with the hat is\r\nby Dr. Wallich, and the expression was a genuine one; the other two are\r\nby Mr. Rejlander. Dr. Duchenne repeatedly insists[809] that, under the\r\nemotion of joy, the mouth is acted on exclusively by the great\r\nzygomatic muscles, which serve to draw the corners backwards and\r\nupwards; but judging from the manner in which the upper teeth are\r\nalways exposed during laughter and broad smiling, as well as from my\r\nown sensations, I cannot doubt that some of the muscles running to the\r\nupper lip are likewise brought into moderate action. The upper and\r\nlower orbicular muscles of the eyes are at the same time more or less\r\ncontracted; and there is an intimate connection, as explained in the\r\nchapter on weeping, between the orbiculars, especially the lower ones\r\nand some of the muscles running to the upper lip. Henle remarks[810] on\r\nthis head, that when a man closely shuts one eye he cannot avoid\r\nretracting the upper lip on the same side; conversely, if any one will\r\nplace his finger on his lower eyelid, and then uncover his upper\r\nincisors as much as possible, he will feel, as his upper lip is drawn\r\nstrongly upwards, that the muscles of the lower eyelid contract. In\r\nHenle’s drawing, given in woodcut, fig. 2, the _musculus malaris_ (H)\r\nwhich runs to the upper lip may be seen to form an almost integral part\r\nof the lower orbicular muscle.\r\n\r\nDr. Duchenne has given a large photograph of an old man (reduced on\r\nPlate III. fig 4), in his usual passive condition, and another of the\r\nsame man (fig. 5), naturally smiling. The latter was instantly\r\nrecognized by every one to whom it was shown as true to nature. He has\r\nalso given, as an example of an unnatural or false smile, another\r\nphotograph (fig. 6) of the same old man, with the corners of his mouth\r\nstrongly retracted by the galvanization of the great zygomatic muscles.\r\nThat the expression is not natural is clear, for I showed this\r\nphotograph to twenty-four persons, of whom three could not in the least\r\ntell what was meant, whilst the others, though they perceived that the\r\nexpression was of the nature of a smile, answered in such words as “a\r\nwicked joke,” “trying to laugh,” “grinning laughter.... half-amazed\r\nlaughter,” &c. Dr. Duchenne attributes the falseness of the expression\r\naltogether to the orbicular muscles of the lower eyelids not being\r\nsufficiently contracted; for he justly lays great stress on their\r\ncontraction in the expression of joy. No doubt there is much truth in\r\nthis view, but not, as it appears to me, the whole truth. The\r\ncontraction of the lower orbiculars is always accompanied, as we have\r\nseen, by the drawing up of the upper lip. Had the upper lip, in fig. 6,\r\nbeen thus acted on to a slight extent, its curvature would have been\r\nless rigid, the naso-labial farrow would have been slightly different,\r\nand the whole expression would, as I believe, have been more natural,\r\nindependently of the more conspicuous effect from the stronger\r\ncontraction of the lower eyelids. The corrugator muscle, moreover, in\r\nfig. 6, is too much contracted, causing a frown; and this muscle never\r\nacts under the influence of joy except during strongly pronounced or\r\nviolent laughter.\r\n\r\nBy the drawing backwards and upwards of the corners of the mouth,\r\nthrough the contraction of the great zygomatic muscles, and by the\r\nraising of the upper lip, the cheeks are drawn upwards. Wrinkles are\r\nthus formed under the eyes, and, with old people, at their outer ends;\r\nand these are highly characteristic of laughter or smiling. As a gentle\r\nsmile increases into a strong one, or into a laugh, every one may feel\r\nand see, if he will attend to his own sensations and look at himself in\r\na mirror, that as the upper lip is drawn up and the lower orbiculars\r\ncontract, the wrinkles in the lower eyelids and those beneath the eyes\r\nare much strengthened or increased. At the same time, as I have\r\nrepeatedly observed, the eyebrows are slightly lowered, which shows\r\nthat the upper as well as the lower orbiculars contract at least to\r\nsome degree, though this passes unperecived, as far as our sensations\r\nare concerned. If the original photograph of the old man, with his\r\ncountenance in its usual placid state (fig. 4), be compared with that\r\n(fig. 5) in which he is naturally smiling, it may be seen that the\r\neyebrows in the latter are a little lowered. I presume that this is\r\nowing to the upper orbiculars being impelled, through the force of\r\nlong-associated habit, to act to a certain extent in concert with the\r\nlower orbiculars, which themselves contract in connection with the\r\ndrawing up of the upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in the zygomatic muscles to contract under pleasurable\r\nemotions is shown by a curious fact, communicated to me by Dr. Browne,\r\nwith respect to patients suffering from GENERAL PARALYSIS OF THE\r\nINSANE.[811] “In this malady there is almost invariably\r\noptimism—delusions as to wealth, rank, grandeur—insane joyousness,\r\nbenevolence, and profusion, while its very earliest physical symptom is\r\ntrembling at the corners of the mouth and at the outer corners of the\r\neyes. This is a well-recognized fact. Constant tremulous agitation of\r\nthe inferior palpebral and great zygomatic muscles is pathognomic of\r\nthe earlier stages of general paralysis. The countenance has a pleased\r\nand benevolent expression. As the disease advances other muscles become\r\ninvolved, but until complete fatuity is reached, the prevailing\r\nexpression is that of feeble benevolence.”\r\n\r\nAs in laughing and broadly smiling the cheeks and upper lip are much\r\nraised, the nose appears to be shortened, and the skin on the bridge\r\nbecomes finely wrinkled in transverse lines, with other oblique\r\nlongitudinal lines on the sides. The upper front teeth are commonly\r\nexposed. A well-marked naso-labial fold is formed, which runs from the\r\nwing of each nostril to the corner of the mouth; and this fold is often\r\ndouble in old persons.\r\n\r\nA bright and sparkling eye is as characteristic of a pleased or amused\r\nstate of mind, as is the retraction of the corners of the mouth and\r\nupper lip with the wrinkles thus produced. Even the eyes of\r\nmicrocephalous idiots, who are so degraded that they never learn to\r\nspeak, brighten slightly when they are pleased.[812] Under extreme\r\nlaughter the eyes are too much suffused with tears to sparkle; but the\r\nmoisture squeezed out of the glands during moderate laughter or smiling\r\nmay aid in giving them lustre; though this must be of altogether\r\nsubordinate importance, as they become dull from grief, though they are\r\nthen often moist. Their brightness seems to be chiefly due to their\r\ntenseness,[813] owing to the contraction of the orbicular muscles and\r\nto the pressure of the raised cheeks. But, according to Dr. Piderit,\r\nwho has discussed this point more fully than any other writer,[814] the\r\ntenseness may be largely attributed to the eyeballs becoming filled\r\nwith blood and other fluids, from the acceleration of the circulation,\r\nconsequent on the excitement of pleasure. He remarks on the contrast in\r\nthe appearance of the eyes of a hectic patient with a rapid\r\ncirculation, and of a man suffering from cholera with almost all the\r\nfluids of his body drained from him. Any cause which lowers the\r\ncirculation deadens the eye. I remember seeing a man utterly prostrated\r\nby prolonged and severe exertion during a very hot day, and a bystander\r\ncompared his eyes to those of a boiled codfish.\r\n\r\nTo return to the sounds produced during laughter. We can see in a vague\r\nmanner how the utterance of sounds of some kind would naturally become\r\nassociated with a pleasurable state of mind; for throughout a large\r\npart of the animal kingdom vocal or instrumental sounds are employed\r\neither as a call or as a charm by one sex for the other. They are also\r\nemployed as the means for a joyful meeting between the parents and\r\ntheir offspring, and between the attached members of the same social\r\ncommunity. But why the sounds which man utters when he is pleased have\r\nthe peculiar reiterated character of laughter we do not know.\r\nNevertheless we can see that they would naturally be as different as\r\npossible from the screams or cries of distress; and as in the\r\nproduction of the latter, the expirations are prolonged and continuous,\r\nwith the inspirations short and interrupted, so it might perhaps have\r\nbeen expected with the sounds uttered from joy, that the expirations\r\nwould have been short and broken with the inspirations prolonged; and\r\nthis is the case.\r\n\r\nIt is an equally obscure point why the corners of the mouth are\r\nretracted and the upper lip raised during ordinary laughter. The mouth\r\nmust not be opened to its utmost extent, for when this occurs during a\r\nparoxysm of excessive laughter hardly any sound is emitted; or it\r\nchanges its tone and seems to come from deep down in the throat. The\r\nrespiratory muscles, and even those of the limbs, are at the same time\r\nthrown into rapid vibratory movements. The lower jaw often partakes of\r\nthis movement, and this would tend to prevent the mouth from being\r\nwidely opened. But as a full volume of sound has to be poured forth,\r\nthe orifice of the mouth must be large; and it is perhaps to gain this\r\nend that the corners are retracted and the upper lip raised. Although\r\nwe can hardly account for the shape of the mouth during laughter, which\r\nleads to wrinkles being formed beneath the eyes, nor for the peculiar\r\nreiterated sound of laughter, nor for the quivering of the jaws,\r\nnevertheless we may infer that all these effects are due to some common\r\ncause. For they are all characteristic and expressive of a pleased\r\nstate of mind in various kinds of monkeys.\r\n\r\nA graduated series can be followed from violent to moderate laughter,\r\nto a broad smile, to a gentle smile, and to the expression of mere\r\ncheerfulness. During excessive laughter the whole body is often thrown\r\nbackward and shakes, or is almost convulsed; the respiration is much\r\ndisturbed; the head and face become gorged with blood, with the veins\r\ndistended; and the orbicular muscles are spasmodically contracted in\r\norder to protect the eyes. Tears are freely shed. Hence, as formerly\r\nremarked, it is scarcely possible to point out any difference between\r\nthe tear-stained face of a person after a paroxysm of excessive\r\nlaughter and after a bitter crying-fit.[815] It is probably due to the\r\nclose similarity of the spasmodic movements caused by these widely\r\ndifferent emotions that hysteric patients alternately cry and laugh\r\nwith violence, and that young children sometimes pass suddenly from the\r\none to the other state. Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he has often seen\r\nthe Chinese, when suffering from deep grief, burst out into hysterical\r\nfits of laughter.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to know whether tears are freely shed during excessive\r\nlaughter by most of the races of men, and I hear from my correspondents\r\nthat this is the case. One instance was observed with the Hindoos, and\r\nthey themselves said that it often occurred. So it is with the Chinese.\r\nThe women of a wild tribe of Malays in the Malacca peninsula, sometimes\r\nshed tears when they laugh heartily, though this seldom occurs. With\r\nthe Dyaks of Borneo it must frequently be the case, at least with the\r\nwomen, for I hear from the Rajah C. Brooke that it is a common\r\nexpression with them to say “we nearly made tears from laughter.” The\r\naborigines of Australia express their emotions freely, and they are\r\ndescribed by my correspondents as jumping about and clapping their\r\nhands for joy, and as often roaring with laughter. No less than four\r\nobservers have seen their eyes freely watering on such occasions; and\r\nin one instance the tears rolled down their cheeks. Mr. Bulmer, a\r\nmissionary in a remote part of Victoria, remarks, “that they have a\r\nkeen sense of the ridiculous; they are excellent mimics, and when one\r\nof them is able to imitate the peculiarities of some absent member of\r\nthe tribe, it is very common to hear all in the camp convulsed with\r\nlaughter.” With Europeans hardly anything excites laughter so easily as\r\nmimicry; and it is rather curious to find the same fact with the\r\nsavages of Australia, who constitute one of the most distinct races in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Africa with two tribes of Kafirs, especially with the\r\nwomen, their eyes often fill with tears during laughter. Gaika, the\r\nbrother of the chief Sandilli, answers my query on this head, with the\r\nwords, “Yes, that is their common practice.” Sir Andrew Smith has seen\r\nthe painted face of a Hottentot woman all furrowed with tears after a\r\nfit of laughter. In Northern Africa, with the Abyssinians, tears are\r\nsecreted under the same circumstances. Lastly, in North America, the\r\nsame fact has been observed in a remarkably savage and isolated tribe,\r\nbut chiefly with the women; in another tribe it was observed only on a\r\nsingle occasion.\r\n\r\nExcessive laughter, as before remarked, graduates into moderate\r\nlaughter. In this latter case the muscles round the eyes are much less\r\ncontracted, and there is little or no frowning. Between a gentle laugh\r\nand a broad smile there is hardly any difference, excepting that in\r\nsmiling no reiterated sound is uttered, though a single rather strong\r\nexpiration, or slight noise—a rudiment of a laugh—may often be heard at\r\nthe commencement of a smile. On a moderately smiling countenance the\r\ncontraction of the upper orbicular muscles can still just be traced by\r\na slight lowering of the eyebrows. The contraction of the lower\r\norbicular and palpebral muscles is much plainer, and is shown by the\r\nwrinkling of the lower eyelids and of the skin beneath them, together\r\nwith a slight drawing up of the upper lip. From the broadest smile we\r\npass by the finest steps into the gentlest one. In this latter case the\r\nfeatures are moved in a much less degree, and much more slowly, and the\r\nmouth is kept closed. The curvature of the naso-labial furrow is also\r\nslightly different in the two cases. We thus see that no abrupt line of\r\ndemarcation can be drawn between the movement of the features during\r\nthe most violent laughter and a very faint smile.[816]\r\n\r\nA smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the\r\ndevelopment of a laugh. But a different and more probable view may be\r\nsuggested; namely, that the habit of uttering load reiterated sounds\r\nfrom a sense of pleasure, first led to the retraction of the corners of\r\nthe mouth and of the upper lip, and to the contraction of the orbicular\r\nmuscles; and that now, through association and long-continued habit,\r\nthe same muscles are brought into slight play whenever any cause\r\nexcites in us a feeling which, if stronger, would have led to laughter;\r\nand the result is a smile.\r\n\r\nWhether we look at laughter as the full development of a smile, or, as\r\nis more probable, at a gentle smile as the last trace of a habit,\r\nfirmly fixed during many generations, of laughing whenever we are\r\njoyful, we can follow in our infants the gradual passage of the one\r\ninto the other. It is well known to those who have the charge of young\r\ninfants, that it is difficult to feel sure when certain movements about\r\ntheir mouths are really expressive; that is, when they really smile.\r\nHence I carefully watched my own infants. One of them at the age of\r\nforty-five days, and being at the time in a happy frame of mind,\r\nsmiled; that is, the corners of the mouth were retracted, and\r\nsimultaneously the eyes became decidedly bright. I observed the same\r\nthing on the following day; but on the third day the child was not\r\nquite well and there was no trace of a smile, and this renders it\r\nprobable that the previous smiles were real. Eight days subsequently\r\nand during the next succeeding week, it was remarkable how his eyes\r\nbrightened whenever he smiled, and his nose became at the same time\r\ntransversely wrinkled. This was now accompanied by a little bleating\r\nnoise, which perhaps represented a laugh. At the age of 113 days these\r\nlittle noises, which were always made during expiration, assumed a\r\nslightly different character, and were more broken or interrupted, as\r\nin sobbing; and this was certainly incipient laughter. The change in\r\ntone seemed to me at the time to be connected with the greater lateral\r\nextension of the mouth as the smiles became broader.\r\n\r\nIn a second infant the first real smile was observed at about the same\r\nage, viz. forty-five days; and in a third, at a somewhat earlier age.\r\nThe second infant, when sixty-five days old, smiled much more broadly\r\nand plainly than did the one first mentioned at the same age; and even\r\nat this early age uttered noises very like laughter. In this gradual\r\nacquirement, by infants, of the habit of laughing, we have a case in\r\nsome degree analogous to that of weeping. As practice is requisite with\r\nthe ordinary movements of the body, such as walking, so it seems to be\r\nwith laughing and weeping. The art of screaming, on the other hand,\r\nfrom being of service to infants, has become finely developed from the\r\nearliest days.\r\n\r\n_High spirits, cheerfulness_.—A man in high spirits, though he may not\r\nactually smile, commonly exhibits some tendency to the retraction of\r\nthe corners of his mouth. From the excitement of pleasure, the\r\ncirculation becomes more rapid; the eyes are bright, and the colour of\r\nthe face rises. The brain, being stimulated by the increased flow of\r\nblood, reacts on the mental powers; lively ideas pass still more\r\nrapidly through the mind, and the affections are warmed. I heard a\r\nchild, a little under four years old, when asked what was meant by\r\nbeing in good spirits, answer, “It is laughing, talking, and kissing.”\r\nIt would be difficult to give a truer and more practical definition. A\r\nman in this state holds his body erect, his head upright, and his eyes\r\nopen. There is no drooping of the features, and no contraction of the\r\neyebrows. On the contrary, the frontal muscle, as Moreau observes,[817]\r\ntends to contract slightly; and this smooths the brow, removes every\r\ntrace of a frown, arches the eyebrows a little, and raises the eyelids.\r\nHence the Latin phrase, _exporrigere frontem_—to unwrinkle the\r\nbrow—means, to be cheerful or merry. The whole expression of a man in\r\ngood spirits is exactly the opposite of that of one suffering from\r\nsorrow. According to Sir C. Bell, “In all the exhilarating emotions the\r\neyebrows, eyelids, the nostrils, and the angles of the mouth are\r\nraised. In the depressing passions it is the reverse.” Under the\r\ninfluence of the latter the brow is heavy, the eyelids, cheeks, mouth,\r\nand whole head droop; the eyes are dull; the countenance pallid, and\r\nthe respiration slow. In joy the face expands, in grief it lengthens.\r\nWhether the principle of antithesis has here come into play in\r\nproducing these opposite expressions, in aid of the direct causes which\r\nhave been specified and which are sufficiently plain, I will not\r\npretend to say.\r\n\r\nWith all the races of man the expression of good spirit appears to be\r\nthe same, and is easily recognized. My informants, from various parts\r\nof the Old and New Worlds, answer in the affirmative to my queries on\r\nthis head, and they give some particulars with respect to Hindoos,\r\nMalays, and New Zealanders. The brightness of the eyes of the\r\nAustralians has struck four observers, and the same fact has been\r\nnoticed with Hindoos, New Zealanders, and the Dyaks of Borneo.\r\n\r\nSavages sometimes express their satisfaction not only by smiling, but\r\nby gestures derived from the pleasure of eating. Thus Mr. Wedgwood[818]\r\nquotes Petherick that the negroes on the Upper Nile began a general\r\nrubbing of their bellies when he displayed his beads; and Leichhardt\r\nsays that the Australians smacked and clacked their mouths at the sight\r\nof his horses and bullocks, and more especially of his kangaroo dogs.\r\nThe Greenlanders, “when they affirm anything with pleasure, suck down\r\nair with a certain sound;”[819] and this may be an imitation of the act\r\nof swallowing savoury food.\r\n\r\nLaughter is suppressed by the firm contraction of the orbicular muscles\r\nof the mouth, which prevents the great zygomatic and other muscles from\r\ndrawing the lips backwards and upwards. The lower lip is also sometimes\r\nheld by the teeth, and this gives a roguish expression to the face, as\r\nwas observed with the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman.[820] The great\r\nzygomatic muscle is sometimes variable in its course, and I have seen a\r\nyoung woman in whom the _depressores anguli oris_ were brought into\r\nstrong action in suppressing a smile; but this by no means gave to her\r\ncountenance a melancholy expression, owing to the brightness of her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nLaughter is frequently employed in a forced manner to conceal or mask\r\nsome other state of mind, even anger. We often see persons laughing in\r\norder to conceal their shame or shyness. When a person purses up his\r\nmouth, as if to prevent the possibility of a smile, though there is\r\nnothing to excite one, or nothing to prevent its free indulgence, an\r\naffected, solemn, or pedantic expression is given; but of such hybrid\r\nexpressions nothing more need here be said. In the case of derision, a\r\nreal or pretended smile or laugh is often blended with the expression\r\nproper to contempt, and this may pass into angry contempt or scorn. In\r\nsuch cases the meaning of the laugh or smile is to show the offending\r\nperson that he excites only amusement.\r\n\r\n_Love, tender feelings, &c_.—Although the emotion of love, for instance\r\nthat of a mother for her infant, is one of the strongest of which the\r\nmind is capable, it can hardly be said to have any proper or peculiar\r\nmeans of expression; and this is intelligible, as it has not habitually\r\nled to any special line of action. No doubt, as affection is a\r\npleasurable sensation, it generally causes a gentle smile and some\r\nbrightening of the eyes. A strong desire to touch the beloved person is\r\ncommonly felt; and love is expressed by this means more plainly than by\r\nany other.[821] Hence we long to clasp in our arms those whom we\r\ntenderly love. We probably owe this desire to inherited habit, in\r\nassociation with the nursing and tending of our children, and with the\r\nmutual caresses of lovers.\r\n\r\nWith the lower animals we see the same principle of pleasure derived\r\nfrom contact in association with love. Dogs and cats manifestly take\r\npleasure in rubbing against their masters and mistresses, and in being\r\nrubbed or patted by them. Many kinds of monkeys, as I am assured by the\r\nkeepers in the Zoological Gardens, delight in fondling and being\r\nfondled by each other, and by persons to whom they are attached. Mr.\r\nBartlett has described to me the behaviour of two chimpanzees, rather\r\nolder animals than those generally imported into this country, when\r\nthey were first brought together. They sat opposite, touching each\r\nother with their much protruded lips; and the one put his hand on the\r\nshoulder of the other. They then mutually folded each other in their\r\narms. Afterwards they stood up, each with one arm on the shoulder of\r\nthe other, lifted up their heads, opened their mouths, and yelled with\r\ndelight.[822]\r\n\r\nWe Europeans are so accustomed to kissing as a mark of affection, that\r\nit might be thought to be innate in mankind; but this is not the case.\r\nSteele was mistaken when he said “Nature was its author, and it began\r\nwith the first courtship.” Jemmy Button, the Fuegian, told me that this\r\npractice was unknown in his land. It is equally unknown with the New\r\nZealanders, Tahitians, Papuans, Australians, Somals of Africa, and the\r\nEsquimaux. But it is so far innate or natural that it apparently\r\ndepends on pleasure from close contact with a beloved person; and it is\r\nreplaced in various parts of the world, by the rubbing of noses, as\r\nwith the New Zealanders and Laplanders, by the rubbing or patting of\r\nthe arms, breasts, or stomachs, or by one man striking his own face\r\nwith the hands or feet of another. Perhaps the practice of blowing, as\r\na mark of affection, on various parts of the body may depend on the\r\nsame principle.[823]\r\n\r\nThe feelings which are called tender are difficult to analyse; they\r\nseem to be compounded of affection, joy, and especially of sympathy.\r\nThese feelings are in themselves of a pleasurable nature, excepting\r\nwhen pity is too deep, or horror is aroused, as in hearing of a\r\ntortured man or animal. They are remarkable under our present point of\r\nview from so readily exciting the secretion of tears. Many a father and\r\nson have wept on meeting after a long separation, especially if the\r\nmeeting has been unexpected. No doubt extreme joy by itself tends to\r\nact on the lacrymal glands; but on such occasions as the foregoing\r\nvague thoughts of the grief which would have been felt had the father\r\nand son never met, will probably have passed through their minds; and\r\ngrief naturally leads to the secretion of tears. Thus on the return of\r\nUlysses:—\r\n\r\n“Telemachus Rose, and clung weeping round his father’s breast.\r\nThere the pent grief rained o’er them, yearning thus.\r\n*   *    *    *    *    *\r\nThus piteously they wailed in sore unrest,\r\nAnd on their weepings had gone down the day,\r\nBut that at last Telemachus found words to say.”\r\n_Worsley’s Translation of the Odyssey_, Book xvi. st. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo again when Penelope at last recognized her husband:—\r\n\r\n“Then from her eyelids the quick tears did start\r\nAnd she ran to him from her place, and threw\r\nHer arms about his neck, and a warm dew\r\nOf kisses poured upon him, and thus spake:”\r\n—Book xxiii.  st.  27.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vivid recollection of our former home, or of long-past happy days,\r\nreadily causes the eyes to be suffused with tears; but here, again, the\r\nthought naturally occurs that these days will never return. In such\r\ncases we may be said to sympathize with ourselves in our present, in\r\ncomparison with our former, state. Sympathy with the distresses of\r\nothers, even with the imaginary distresses of a heroine in a pathetic\r\nstory, for whom we feel no affection, readily excites tears. So does\r\nsympathy with the happiness of others, as with that of a lover, at last\r\nsuccessful after many hard trials in a well-told tale.\r\n\r\nSympathy appears to constitute a separate or distinct emotion; and it\r\nis especially apt to excite the lacrymal glands. This holds good\r\nwhether we give or receive sympathy. Every one must have noticed how\r\nreadily children burst out crying if we pity them for some small hurt.\r\nWith the melancholic insane, as Dr. Crichton Browne informs me, a kind\r\nword will often plunge them into unrestrained weeping. As soon as we\r\nexpress our pity for the grief of a friend, tears often come into our\r\nown eyes. The feeling of sympathy is commonly explained by assuming\r\nthat, when we see or hear of suffering in another, the idea of\r\nsuffering is called up so vividly in our own minds that we ourselves\r\nsuffer. But this explanation is hardly sufficient, for it does not\r\naccount for the intimate alliance between sympathy and affection. We\r\nundoubtedly sympathize far more deeply with a beloved than with an\r\nindifferent person; and the sympathy of the one gives us far more\r\nrelief than that of the other. Yet assuredly we can sympathize with\r\nthose for whom we feel no affection.\r\n\r\nWhy suffering, when actually experienced by ourselves, excites weeping,\r\nhas been discussed in a former chapter. With respect to joy, its\r\nnatural and universal expression is laughter; and with all the races of\r\nman loud laughter leads to the secretion of tears more freely than does\r\nany other cause excepting distress. The suffusion of the eyes with\r\ntears, which undoubtedly occurs under great joy, though there is no\r\nlaughter, can, as it seems to me, be explained through habit and\r\nassociation on the same principles as the effusion of tears from grief,\r\nalthough there is no screaming. Nevertheless it is not a little\r\nremarkable that sympathy with the distresses of others should excite\r\ntears more freely than our own distress; and this certainly is the\r\ncase. Many a man, from whose eyes no suffering of his own could wring a\r\ntear, has shed tears at the sufferings of a beloved friend. It is still\r\nmore remarkable that sympathy with the happiness or good fortune of\r\nthose whom we tenderly love should lead to the same result, whilst a\r\nsimilar happiness felt by ourselves would leave our eyes dry. We\r\nshould, however, bear in mind that the long-continued habit of\r\nrestraint which is so powerful in checking the free flow of tears from\r\nbodily pain, has not been brought into play in preventing a moderate\r\neffusion of tears in sympathy with the sufferings or happiness of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMusic has a wonderful power, as I have elsewhere attempted to\r\nshow,[824] of recalling in a vague and indefinite manner, those strong\r\nemotions which were felt during long-past ages, when, as is probable,\r\nour early progenitors courted each other by the aid of vocal tones. And\r\nas several of our strongest emotions—grief, great joy, love, and\r\nsympathy—lead to the free secretion of tears, it is not surprising that\r\nmusic should be apt to cause our eyes to become suffused with tears,\r\nespecially when we are already softened by any of the tenderer\r\nfeelings. Music often produces another peculiar effect. We know that\r\nevery strong sensation, emotion, or excitement—extreme pain, rage,\r\nterror, joy, or the passion of love—all have a special tendency to\r\ncause the muscles to tremble; and the thrill or slight shiver which\r\nruns down the backbone and limbs of many persons when they are\r\npowerfully affected by music, seems to bear the same relation to the\r\nabove trembling of the body, as a slight suffusion of tears from the\r\npower of music does to weeping from any strong and real emotion.\r\n\r\n_Devotion_.—As devotion is, in some degree, related to affection,\r\nthough mainly consisting of reverence, often combined with fear, the\r\nexpression of this state of mind may here be briefly noticed. With some\r\nsects, both past and present, religion and love have been strangely\r\ncombined; and it has even been maintained, lamentable as the fact may\r\nbe, that the holy kiss of love differs but little from that which a man\r\nbestows on a woman, or a woman on a man.[825] Devotion is chiefly\r\nexpressed by the face being directed towards the heavens, with the\r\neyeballs upturned. Sir C. Bell remarks that, at the approach of sleep,\r\nor of a fainting-fit, or of death, the pupils are drawn upwards and\r\ninwards; and he believes that “when we are wrapt in devotional\r\nfeelings, and outward impressions are unheeded, the eyes are raised by\r\nan action neither taught nor acquired.” and that this is due to the\r\nsame cause as in the above cases.[826] That the eyes are upturned\r\nduring sleep is, as I hear from Professor Donders, certain. With\r\nbabies, whilst sucking their mother’s breast, this movement of the\r\neyeballs often gives to them an absurd appearance of ecstatic delight;\r\nand here it may be clearly perceived that a struggle is going on\r\nagainst the position naturally assumed during sleep. But Sir C. Bell’s\r\nexplanation of the fact, which rests on the assumption that certain\r\nmuscles are more under the control of the will than others is, as I\r\nhear from Professor Donders, incorrect. As the eyes are often turned up\r\nin prayer, without the mind being so much absorbed in thought as to\r\napproach to the unconsciousness of sleep, the movement is probably a\r\nconventional one—the result of the common belief that Heaven, the\r\nsource of Divine power to which we pray, is seated above us.\r\n\r\nA humble kneeling posture, with the hands upturned and palms joined,\r\nappears to us, from long habit, a gesture so appropriate to devotion,\r\nthat it might be thought to be innate; but I have not met with any\r\nevidence to this effect with the various extra-European races of\r\nmankind. During the classical period of Roman history it does not\r\nappear, as I hear from an excellent classic, that the hands were thus\r\njoined during prayer. Mr. Rensleigh Wedgwood has apparently given[827]\r\nthe true explanation, though this implies that the attitude is one of\r\nslavish subjection. “When the suppliant kneels and holds up his hands\r\nwith the palms joined, he represents a captive who proves the\r\ncompleteness of his submission by offering up his hands to be bound by\r\nthe victor. It is the pictorial representation of the Latin _dare\r\nmanus_, to signify submission.” Hence it is not probable that either\r\nthe uplifting of the eyes or the joining of the open hands, under the\r\ninfluence of devotional feelings, are innate or truly expressive\r\nactions; and this could hardly have been expected, for it is very\r\ndoubtful whether feelings, such as we should now rank as devotional,\r\naffected the hearts of men, whilst they remained during past ages in an\r\nuncivilized condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. REFLECTION—MEDITATION-ILL-TEMPER—SULKINESS—DETERMINATION.\r\n\r\nThe act of frowning—Reflection with an effort, or with the perception\r\nof something difficult or disagreeable—Abstracted\r\nmeditation—Ill-temper—Moroseness—Obstinacy Sulkiness and\r\npouting—Decision or determination—The firm closure of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe corrugators, by their contraction, lower the eyebrows and bring\r\nthem together, producing vertical furrows on the forehead—that is, a\r\nfrown. Sir C. Bell, who erroneously thought that the corrugator was\r\npeculiar to man, ranks it as “the most remarkable muscle of the human\r\nface. It knits the eyebrows with an energetic effort, which\r\nunaccountably, but irresistibly, conveys the idea of mind.” Or, as he\r\nelsewhere says, “when the eyebrows are knit, energy of mind is\r\napparent, and there is the mingling of thought and emotion with the\r\nsavage and brutal rage of the mere animal.”[901] There is much truth in\r\nthese remarks, but hardly the whole truth. Dr. Duchenne has called the\r\ncorrugator the muscle of reflection;[902] but this name, without some\r\nlimitation, cannot be considered as quite correct.\r\n\r\nA man may be absorbed in the deepest thought, and his brow will remain\r\nsmooth until he encounters some obstacle in his train of reasoning, or\r\nis interrupted by some disturbance, and then a frown passes like a\r\nshadow over his brow. A half-starved man may think intently how to\r\nobtain food, but he probably will not frown unless he encounters either\r\nin thought or action some difficulty, or finds the food when obtained\r\nnauseous. I have noticed that almost everyone instantly frowns if he\r\nperceives a strange or bad taste in what he is eating. I asked several\r\npersons, without explaining my object, to listen intently to a very\r\ngentle tapping sound, the nature and source of which they all perfectly\r\nknew, and not one frowned; but a man who joined us, and who could not\r\nconceive what we were all doing in profound silence, when asked to\r\nlisten, frowned much, though not in an ill-temper, and said he could\r\nnot in the least understand what we all wanted. Dr. Piderit[903] who\r\nhas published remarks to the same effect, adds that stammerers\r\ngenerally frown in speaking, and that a man in doing even so trifling a\r\nthing as pulling on a boot, frowns if he finds it too tight. Some\r\npersons are such habitual frowners, that the mere effort of speaking\r\nalmost always causes their brows to contract.\r\n\r\nMen of all races frown when they are in any way perplexed in thought,\r\nas I infer from the answers which I have received to my queries; but I\r\nframed them badly, confounding absorbed meditation with perplexed\r\nreflection. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Australians, Malays,\r\nHindoos, and Kafirs of South Africa frown, when they are puzzled.\r\nDobritzhoffer remarks that the Guaranies of South America on like\r\noccasions knit their brows.[904]\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, we may conclude that frowning is not the\r\nexpression of simple reflection, however profound, or of attention,\r\nhowever close, but of something difficult or displeasing encountered in\r\na train of thought or in action. Deep reflection can, however, seldom\r\nbe long carried on without some difficulty, so that it will generally\r\nbe accompanied by a frown. Hence it is that frowning commonly gives to\r\nthe countenance, as Sir C. Bell remarks, an aspect of intellectual\r\nenergy. But in order that this effect may be produced, the eyes must be\r\nclear and steady, or they may be cast downwards, as often occurs in\r\ndeep thought. The countenance must not be otherwise disturbed, as in\r\nthe case of an ill-tempered or peevish man, or of one who shows the\r\neffects of prolonged suffering, with dulled eyes and drooping jaw, or\r\nwho perceives a bad taste in his food, or who finds it difficult to\r\nperform some trifling act, such as threading a needle. In these cases a\r\nfrown may often be seen, but it will be accompanied by some other\r\nexpression, which will entirely prevent the countenance having an\r\nappearance of intellectual energy or of profound thought.\r\n\r\nWe may now inquire how it is that a frown should express the perception\r\nof something difficult or disagreeable, either in thought or action. In\r\nthe same way as naturalists find it advisable to trace the\r\nembryological development of an organ in order fully to understand its\r\nstructure, so with the movements of expression it is advisable to\r\nfollow as nearly as possible the same plan. The earliest and almost\r\nsole expression seen during the first days of infancy, and then often\r\nexhibited is that displayed during the act of screaming; and screaming\r\nis excited, both at first and for some time afterwards, by every\r\ndistressing or displeasing sensation and emotion,—by hunger, pain,\r\nanger, jealousy, fear, &c. At such times the muscles round the eyes are\r\nstrongly contracted; and this, as I believe, explains to a large extent\r\nthe act of frowning during the remainder of our lives. I repeatedly\r\nobserved my own infants, from under the age of one week to that of two\r\nor three months, and found that when a screaming-fit came on gradually,\r\nthe first sign was the contraction of the corrugators, which produced a\r\nslight frown, quickly followed by the contraction of the other muscles\r\nround the eyes. When an infant is uncomfortable or unwell, little\r\nfrowns—as I record in my notes—may be seen incessantly passing like\r\nshadows over its face; these being generally, but not always, followed\r\nsooner or later by a crying-fit. For instance, I watched for some time\r\na baby, between seven and eight weeks old, sucking some milk which was\r\ncold, and therefore displeasing to him; and a steady little frown was\r\nmaintained all the time. This was never developed into an actual\r\ncrying-fit, though occasionally every stage of close approach could be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAs the habit of contracting the brows has been followed by infants\r\nduring innumerable generations, at the commencement of every crying or\r\nscreaming fit, it has become firmly associated with the incipient sense\r\nof something distressing or disagreeable. Hence under similar\r\ncircumstances it would be apt to be continued during maturity, although\r\nnever then developed into a crying-fit. Screaming or weeping begins to\r\nbe voluntarily restrained at an early period of life, whereas frowning\r\nis hardly ever restrained at any age. It is perhaps worth notice that\r\nwith children much given to weeping, anything which perplexes their\r\nminds, and which would cause most other children merely to frown,\r\nreadily makes them weep. So with certain classes of the insane, any\r\neffort of mind, however slight, which with an habitual frowner would\r\ncause a slight frown, leads to their weeping in an unrestrained manner.\r\nIt is not more surprising that the habit of contracting the brows at\r\nthe first perception of something distressing, although gained during\r\ninfancy, should be retained during the rest of our lives, than that\r\nmany other associated habits acquired at an early age should be\r\npermanently retained both by man and the lower animals. For instance,\r\nfull-grown cats, when feeling warm and comfortable, often retain the\r\nhabit of alternately protruding their fore-feet with extended toes,\r\nwhich habit they practised for a definite purpose whilst sucking their\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nAnother and distinct cause has probably strengthened the habit of\r\nfrowning, whenever the mind is intent on any subject and encounters\r\nsome difficulty. Vision is the most important of all the senses, and\r\nduring primeval times the closest attention must have been incessantly:\r\ndirected towards distant objects for the sake of obtaining prey and\r\navoiding danger. I remember being struck, whilst travelling in parts of\r\nSouth America, which were dangerous from the presence of Indians, how\r\nincessantly, yet as it appeared unconsciously, the half-wild Gauchos\r\nclosely scanned the whole horizon. Now, when any one with no covering\r\non his head (as must have been aboriginally the case with mankind),\r\nstrives to the utmost to distinguish in broad daylight, and especially\r\nif the sky is bright, a distant object, he almost invariably contracts\r\nhis brows to prevent the entrance of too much light; the lower eyelids,\r\ncheeks, and upper lip being at the same time raised, so as to lessen\r\nthe orifice of the eyes. I have purposely asked several persons, young\r\nand old, to look, under the above circumstances, at distant objects,\r\nmaking them believe that I only wished to test the power of their\r\nvision; and they all behaved in the manner just described. Some of\r\nthem, also, put their open, flat hands over their eyes to keep out the\r\nexcess of light. Gratiolet, after making some remarks to nearly the\r\nsame effect,[905] says, “Ce sont là des attitudes de vision difficile.”\r\nHe concludes that the muscles round the eyes contract partly for the\r\nsake of excluding too much light (which appears to me the more\r\nimportant end), and partly to prevent all rays striking the retina,\r\nexcept those which come direct from the object that is scrutinized. Mr.\r\nBowman, whom I consulted on this point, thinks that the contraction of\r\nthe surrounding muscles may, in addition, “partly sustain the\r\nconsensual movements of the two eyes, by giving a firmer support while\r\nthe globes are brought to binocular vision by their own proper\r\nmuscles.”\r\n\r\nAs the effort of viewing with care under a bright light a distant\r\nobject is both difficult and irksome, and as this effort has been\r\nhabitually accompanied, during numberless generations, by the\r\ncontraction of the eyebrows, the habit of frowning will thus have been\r\nmuch strengthened; although it was originally practised during infancy\r\nfrom a quite independent cause, namely as the first step in the\r\nprotection of the eyes during screaming. There is, indeed, much\r\nanalogy, as far as the state of the mind is concerned, between intently\r\nscrutinizing a distant object, and following out an obscure train of\r\nthought, or performing some little and troublesome mechanical work. The\r\nbelief that the habit of contracting the brows is continued when there\r\nis no need whatever to exclude too much light, receives support from\r\nthe cases formerly alluded to, in which the eyebrows or eyelids are\r\nacted on under certain circumstances in a useless manner, from having\r\nbeen similarly used, under analogous circumstances, for a serviceable\r\npurpose. For instance, we voluntarily close our eyes when we do not\r\nwish to see any object, and we are apt to close them, when we reject a\r\nproposition, as if we could not or would not see it; or when we think\r\nabout something horrible. We raise our eyebrows when we wish to see\r\nquickly all round us, and we often do the same, when we earnestly\r\ndesire to remember something; acting as if we endeavoured to see it.\r\n\r\n_Abstraction. Meditation_.—When a person is lost in thought with his\r\nmind absent, or, as it is sometimes said, “when he is in a brown\r\nstudy,” he does not frown, but his eyes appear vacant. The lower\r\neyelids are generally raised and wrinkled, in the same manner as when a\r\nshort-sighted person tries to distinguish a distant object; and the\r\nupper orbicular muscles are at the same time slightly contracted. The\r\nwrinkling of the lower eyelids under these circumstances has been\r\nobserved with some savages, as by Mr. Dyson Lacy with the Australians\r\nof Queensland, and several times by Mr. Geach with the Malays of the\r\ninterior of Malacca. What the meaning or cause of this action may be,\r\ncannot at present be explained; but here we have another instance of\r\nmovement round the eyes in relation to the state of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe vacant expression of the eyes is very peculiar, and at once shows\r\nwhen a man is completely lost in thought. Professor Donders has, with\r\nhis usual kindness, investigated this subject for me. He has observed\r\nothers in this condition, and has been himself observed by Professor\r\nEngelmann. The eyes are not then fixed on any object, and therefore\r\nnot, as I had imagined, on some distant object. The lines of vision of\r\nthe two eyes even often become slightly divergent; the divergence, if\r\nthe head be held vertically, with the plane of vision horizontal,\r\namounting to an angle of 2° as a maximum. This was ascertained by\r\nobserving the crossed double image of a distant object. When the head\r\ndroops forward, as often occurs with a man absorbed in thought, owing\r\nto the general relaxation of his muscles, if the plane of vision be\r\nstill horizontal, the eyes are necessarily a little turned upwards, and\r\nthen the divergence is as much as 3°, or 3° 5’: if the eyes are turned\r\nstill more upwards, it amounts to between 6° and 7°. Professor Donders\r\nattributes this divergence to the almost complete relaxation of certain\r\nmuscles of the eyes, which would be apt to follow from the mind being\r\nwholly absorbed.[906] The active condition of the muscles of the eyes\r\nis that of convergence; and Professor Donders remarks, as bearing on\r\ntheir divergence during a period of complete abstraction, that when one\r\neye becomes blind, it almost always, after a short lapse of time,\r\ndeviates outwards; for its muscles are no longer used in moving the\r\neyeball inwards for the sake of binocular vision.\r\n\r\nPerplexed reflection is often accompanied by certain movements or\r\ngestures. At such times we commonly raise our hands to our foreheads,\r\nmouths, or chins; but we do not act thus, as far as I have seen, when\r\nwe are quite lost in meditation, and no difficulty is encountered.\r\nPlautus, describing in one of his plays[907] a puzzled man, says, “Now\r\nlook, he has pillared his chin upon his hand.” Even so trifling and\r\napparently unmeaning a gesture as the raising of the hand to the face\r\nhas been observed with some savages. Mr. J. Mansel Weale has seen it\r\nwith the Kafirs of South Africa; and the native chief Gaika adds, that\r\nmen then “sometimes pull their beards.” Mr. Washington Matthews, who\r\nattended to some of the wildest tribes of Indians in the western\r\nregions of the United States, remarks that he has seen them when\r\nconcentrating their thoughts, bring their “hands, usually the thumb and\r\nindex finger, in contact with some part of the face, commonly the upper\r\nlip.” We can understand why the forehead should be pressed or rubbed,\r\nas deep thought tries the brain; but why the hand should be raised to\r\nthe mouth or face is far from clear.\r\n\r\n_Ill-temper_.—We have seen that frowning is the natural expression of\r\nsome difficulty encountered, or of something disagreeable experienced\r\neither in thought or action, and he whose mind is often and readily\r\naffected in this way, will be apt to be ill-tempered, or slightly\r\nangry, or peevish, and will commonly show it by frowning. But a cross\r\nexpression, due to a frown, may be counteracted, if the mouth appears\r\nsweet, from being habitually drawn into a smile, and the eyes are\r\nbright and cheerful. So it will be if the eye is clear and steady, and\r\nthere is the appearance of earnest reflection. Frowning, with some\r\ndepression of the corners of the mouth, which is a sign of grief, gives\r\nan air of peevishness. If a child (see Plate IV., fig. 2)[908] frowns\r\nmuch whilst crying, but does not strongly contract in the usual manner\r\nthe orbicular muscles, a well-marked expression of anger or even of\r\nrage, together with misery, is displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIll-temper. Plate IV\r\n\r\nIf the whole frowning brow be drawn much downward by the contraction of\r\nthe pyramidal muscles of the nose, which produces transverse wrinkles\r\nor folds across the base of the nose, the expression becomes one of\r\nmoroseness. Duchenne believes that the contraction of this muscle,\r\nwithout any frowning, gives the appearance of extreme and aggressive\r\nhardness.[909] But I much doubt whether this is a true or natural\r\nexpression. I have shown Duchenne’s photograph of a young man, with\r\nthis muscle strongly contracted by means of galvanism, to eleven\r\npersons, including some artists, and none of them could form an idea\r\nwhat was intended, except one, a girl, who answered correctly, “surely\r\nreserve.” When I first looked at this photograph, knowing what was\r\nintended, my imagination added, as I believe, what was necessary,\r\nnamely, a frowning brow; and consequently the expression appeared to me\r\ntrue and extremely morose.\r\n\r\nA firmly closed mouth, in addition to a lowered and frowning brow,\r\ngives determination to the expression, or may make it obstinate and\r\nsullen. How it comes that the firm closure of the mouth gives the\r\nappearance of determination will presently be discussed. An expression\r\nof sullen obstinacy has been clearly recognized by my informants, in\r\nthe natives of six different regions of Australia. It is well marked,\r\naccording to Mr. Scott, with the Hindoos. It has been recognized with\r\nthe Malays, Chinese, Kafirs, Abyssinians, and in a conspicuous degree,\r\naccording to Dr. Rothrock, with the wild Indians of North America, and\r\naccording to Mr. D. Forbes, with the Aymaras of Bolivia. I have also\r\nobserved it with the Araucanos of southern Chili. Mr. Dyson Lacy\r\nremarks that the natives of Australia, when in this frame of mind,\r\nsometimes fold their arms across their breasts, an attitude which may\r\nbe seen with us. A firm determination, amounting to obstinacy, is,\r\nalso, sometimes expressed by both shoulders being kept raised, the\r\nmeaning of which gesture will be explained in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nWith young children sulkiness is shown by pouting, or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, “making a snout.”[910] When the corners of the mouth\r\nare much depressed, the lower lip is a little everted and protruded;\r\nand this is likewise called a pout. But the pouting here referred to,\r\nconsists of the protrusion of both lips into a tubular form, sometimes\r\nto such an extent as to project as far as the end of the nose, if this\r\nbe short. Pouting is generally accompanied by frowning, and sometimes\r\nby the utterance of a booing or whooing noise. This expression is\r\nremarkable, as almost the sole one, as far as I know, which is\r\nexhibited much more plainly during childhood, at least with Europeans,\r\nthan during maturity. There is, however, some tendency to the\r\nprotrusion of the lips with the adults of all races under the influence\r\nof great rage. Some children pout when they are shy, and they can then\r\nhardly be called sulky.\r\n\r\nFrom inquiries which I have made in several large families, pouting\r\ndoes not seem very common with European children; but it prevails\r\nthroughout the world, and must be both common and strongly marked with\r\nmost savage races, as it has caught the attention of many observers. It\r\nhas been noticed in eight different districts of Australia; and one of\r\nmy informants remarks how greatly the lips of the children are then\r\nprotruded. Two observers have seen pouting with the children of\r\nHindoos; three, with those of the Kafirs and Fingoes of South Africa,\r\nand with the Hottentots; and two, with the children of the wild Indians\r\nof North America. Pouting has also been observed with the Chinese,\r\nAbyssinians, Malays of Malacca, Dyaks of Borneo, and often with the New\r\nZealanders. Mr. Mansel Weale informs me that he has seen the lips much\r\nprotruded, not only with the children of the Kafirs, but with the\r\nadults of both sexes when sulky; and Mr. Stack has sometimes observed\r\nthe same thing with the men, and very frequently with the women of New\r\nZealand. A trace of the same expression may occasionally be detected\r\neven with adult Europeans.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the protrusion of the lips, especially with young\r\nchildren, is characteristic of sulkiness throughout the greater part of\r\nthe world. This movement apparently results from the retention, chiefly\r\nduring youth, of a primordial habit, or from an occasional reversion to\r\nit. Young orangs and chimpanzees protrude their lips to an\r\nextraordinary degree, as described in a former chapter, when they are\r\ndiscontented, somewhat angry, or sulky; also when they are surprised, a\r\nlittle frightened, and even when slightly pleased. Their mouths are\r\nprotruded apparently for the sake of making the various noises proper\r\nto these several states of mind; and its shape, as I observed with the\r\nchimpanzee, differed slightly when the cry of pleasure and that of\r\nanger were uttered. As soon as these animals become enraged, the shape\r\nof the month wholly changes, and the teeth are exposed. The adult orang\r\nwhen wounded is said to emit “a singular cry, consisting at first of\r\nhigh notes, which at length deepen into a low roar. While giving out\r\nthe high notes he thrusts out his lips into a funnel shape, but in\r\nuttering the low notes he holds his mouth wide open.”[911] With the\r\ngorilla, the lower lip is said to be capable of great elongation. If\r\nthen our semi-human progenitors protruded their lips when sulky or a\r\nlittle angered, in the same manner as do the existing anthropoid apes,\r\nit is not an anomalous, though a curious fact, that our children should\r\nexhibit, when similarly affected, a trace of the same expression,\r\ntogether with some tendency to utter a noise. For it is not at all\r\nunusual for animals to retain, more or less perfectly, during early\r\nyouth, and subsequently to lose, characters which were aboriginally\r\npossessed by their adult progenitors, and which are still retained by\r\ndistinct species, their near relations.\r\n\r\nNor is it an anomalous fact that the children of savages should exhibit\r\na stronger tendency to protrude their lips, when sulky, than the\r\nchildren of civilized Europeans; for the essence of savagery seems to\r\nconsist in the retention of a primordial condition, and this\r\noccasionally holds good even with bodily peculiarities.[912] It may be\r\nobjected to this view of the origin of pouting, that the anthropoid\r\napes likewise protrude their lips when astonished and even when a\r\nlittle pleased; whilst with us this expression is generally confined to\r\na sulky frame of mind. But we shall see in a future chapter that with\r\nmen of various races surprise does sometimes lead to a slight\r\nprotrusion of the lips, though great surprise or astonishment is more\r\ncommonly shown by the mouth being widely opened. As when we smile or\r\nlaugh we draw back the corners of the mouth, we have lost any tendency\r\nto protrude the lips, when pleased, if indeed our early progenitors\r\nthus expressed pleasure.\r\n\r\nA little gesture made by sulky children may here be noticed, namely,\r\ntheir “showing a cold shoulder.” This has a different meaning, as, I\r\nbelieve, from the keeping both shoulders raised. A cross child, sitting\r\non its parent’s knee, will lift up the near shoulder, then jerk it\r\naway, as if from a caress, and afterwards give a backward push with it,\r\nas if to push away the offender. I have seen a child, standing at some\r\ndistance from any one, clearly express its feelings by raising one\r\nshoulder, giving it a little backward movement, and then turning away\r\nits whole body.\r\n\r\n_Decision or determination_.—The firm closure of the mouth tends to\r\ngive an expression of determination or decision to the countenance. No\r\ndetermined man probably ever had an habitually gaping mouth. Hence,\r\nalso, a small and weak lower jaw, which seems to indicate that the\r\nmouth is not habitually and firmly closed, is commonly thought to be\r\ncharacteristic of feebleness of character. A prolonged effort of any\r\nkind, whether of body or mind, implies previous determination; and if\r\nit can be shown that the mouth is generally closed with firmness before\r\nand during a great and continued exertion of the muscular system, then,\r\nthrough the principle of association, the mouth would almost certainly\r\nbe closed as soon as any determined resolution was taken. Now several\r\nobservers have noticed that a man, in commencing any violent muscular\r\neffort, invariably first distends his lungs with air, and then\r\ncompresses it by the strong contraction of the muscles of the chest;\r\nand to effect this the mouth must be firmly closed. Moreover, as soon\r\nas the man is compelled to draw breath, he still keeps his chest as\r\nmuch distended as possible.\r\n\r\nVarious causes have been assigned for this manner of acting. Sir C.\r\nBell maintains[913] that the chest is distended with air, and is kept\r\ndistended at such times, in order to give a fixed support to the\r\nmuscles which are thereto attached. Hence, as he remarks, when two men\r\nare engaged in a deadly contest, a terrible silence prevails, broken\r\nonly by hard stifled breathing. There is silence, because to expel the\r\nair in the utterance of any sound would be to relax the support for the\r\nmuscles of the arms. If an outcry is heard, supposing the struggle to\r\ntake place in the dark, we at once know that one of the two has given\r\nup in despair.\r\n\r\nGratiolet admits[914] that when a man has to struggle with another to\r\nhis utmost, or has to support a great weight, or to keep for a long\r\ntime the same forced attitude, it is necessary for him first to make a\r\ndeep inspiration, and then to cease breathing; but he thinks that Sir\r\nC. Bell’s explanation is erroneous. He maintains that arrested\r\nrespiration retards the circulation of the blood, of which I believe\r\nthere is no doubt, and he adduces some curious evidence from the\r\nstructure of the lower animals, showing, on the one hand, that a\r\nretarded circulation is necessary for prolonged muscular exertion, and,\r\non the other hand, that a rapid circulation is necessary for rapid\r\nmovements. According to this view, when we commence any great exertion,\r\nwe close our mouths and stop breathing, in order to retard the\r\ncirculation of the blood. Gratiolet sums up the subject by saying,\r\n“C’est là la vraie théorie de l’effort continu;” but how far this\r\ntheory is admitted by other physiologists I do not know.\r\n\r\nDr. Piderit accounts[915] for the firm closure of the mouth during\r\nstrong muscular exertion, on the principle that the influence of the\r\nwill spreads to other muscles besides those necessarily brought into\r\naction in making any particular exertion; and it is natural that the\r\nmuscles of respiration and of the mouth, from being so habitually used,\r\nshould be especially liable to be thus acted on. It appears to me that\r\nthere probably is some truth in this view, for we are apt to press the\r\nteeth hard together during violent exertion, and this is not requisite\r\nto prevent expiration, whilst the muscles of the chest are strongly\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\nLastly, when a man has to perform some delicate and difficult\r\noperation, not requiring the exertion of any strength, he nevertheless\r\ngenerally closes his mouth and ceases for a time to breathe; but he\r\nacts thus in order that the movements of his chest may not disturb,\r\nthose of his arms. A person, for instance, whilst threading a needle,\r\nmay be seen to compress his lips and either to stop breathing, or to\r\nbreathe as quietly as possible. So it was, as formerly stated, with a\r\nyoung and sick chimpanzee, whilst it amused itself by killing flies\r\nwith its knuckles, as they buzzed about on the window-panes. To perform\r\nan action, however trifling, if difficult, implies some amount of\r\nprevious determination.\r\n\r\nThere appears nothing improbable in all the above assigned causes\r\nhaving come into play in different degrees, either conjointly or\r\nseparately, on various occasions. The result would be a\r\nwell-established habit, now perhaps inherited, of firmly closing the\r\nmouth at the commencement of and during any violent and prolonged\r\nexertion, or any delicate operation. Through the principle of\r\nassociation there would also be a strong tendency towards this same\r\nhabit, as soon as the mind had resolved on any particular action or\r\nline of conduct, even before there was any bodily exertion, or if none\r\nwere requisite. The habitual and firm closure of the mouth would thus\r\ncome to show decision of character; and decision readily passes into\r\nobstinacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. HATRED AND ANGER.\r\n\r\nHatred—Rage, effects of on the system—Uncovering of the teeth—Rage in\r\nthe insane—Anger and indignation—As expressed by the various races of\r\nman—Sneering and defiance—The uncovering of the canine tooth on one\r\nside of the face.\r\n\r\nIf we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man,\r\nor if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike\r\neasily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate\r\ndegree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or\r\nfeatures, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by\r\nsome ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a\r\nhated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or\r\nrage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience\r\nmerely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful,\r\nthen hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel\r\nmaster, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity.[1001] Most of\r\nour emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they\r\nhardly exist if the body remains passive—the nature of the expression\r\ndepending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been\r\nhabitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man,\r\nfor instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may\r\nstrongly desire to save if; yet, as Louis XVI. said, when surrounded by\r\na fierce mob, “Am I afraid? feel my pulse.” So a man may intensely hate\r\nanother, but until his bodily frame is affected, he cannot be said to\r\nbe enraged.\r\n\r\n_Rage_.—I have already had occasion to treat of this emotion in the\r\nthird chapter, when discussing the direct influence of the excited\r\nsensorium on the body, in combination with the effects of habitually\r\nassociated actions. Rage exhibits itself in the most diversified\r\nmanner. The heart and circulation are always affected; the face reddens\r\nor becomes purple, with the veins on the forehead and neck distended.\r\nThe reddening of the skin has been observed with the copper-coloured\r\nIndians of South America,[1002] and even, as it is said, on the white\r\ncicatrices left by old wounds on negroes.[1003] Monkeys also redden\r\nfrom passion. With one of my own infants, under four months old, I\r\nrepeatedly observed that the first symptom of an approaching passion\r\nwas the rushing of the blood into his bare scalp. On the other hand,\r\nthe action of the heart is sometimes so much impeded by great rage,\r\nthat the countenance becomes pallid or livid,[1004] and not a few men\r\nwith heart-disease have dropped down dead under this powerful emotion.\r\n\r\nThe respiration is likewise affected; the chest heaves, and the dilated\r\nnostrils quiver.[1005] As Tennyson writes, “sharp breaths of anger\r\npuffed her fairy nostrils out.” Hence we have such expressions as\r\n“breathing out vengeance,” and “fuming with anger.”[1006]\r\n\r\nThe excited brain gives strength to the muscles, and at the same time\r\nenergy to the will. The body is commonly held erect ready for instant\r\naction, but sometimes it is bent forward towards the offending person,\r\nwith the limbs more or less rigid. The mouth is generally closed with\r\nfirmness, showing fixed determination, and the teeth are clenched or\r\nground together. Such gestures as the raising of the arms, with the\r\nfists clenched, as if to strike the offender, are common. Few men in a\r\ngreat passion, and telling some one to begone, can resist acting as if\r\nthey intended to strike or push the man violently away. The desire,\r\nindeed, to strike often becomes so intolerably strong, that inanimate\r\nobjects are struck or dashed to the ground; but the gestures frequently\r\nbecome altogether purposeless or frantic. Young children, when in a\r\nviolent rage roll on the ground on their backs or bellies, screaming,\r\nkicking, scratching, or biting everything within reach. So it is, as I\r\nhear from Mr. Scott, with Hindoo children; and, as we have seen, with\r\nthe young of the anthropomorphous apes.\r\n\r\nBut the muscular system is often affected in a wholly different way;\r\nfor trembling is a frequent consequence of extreme rage. The paralysed\r\nlips then refuse to obey the will, “and the voice sticks in the\r\nthroat;”[1007] or it is rendered loud, harsh, and discordant. If there\r\nbe much and rapid speaking, the mouth froths. The hair sometimes\r\nbristles; but I shall return to this subject in another chapter, when I\r\ntreat of the mingled emotions of rage and terror. There is in most\r\ncases a strongly-marked frown on the forehead; for this follows from\r\nthe sense of anything displeasing or difficult, together with\r\nconcentration of mind. But sometimes the brow, instead of being much\r\ncontracted and lowered, remains smooth, with the glaring eyes kept\r\nwidely open. The eyes are always bright, or may, as Homer expresses it,\r\nglisten with fire. They are sometimes bloodshot, and are said to\r\nprotrude from their sockets—the result, no doubt, of the head being\r\ngorged with blood, as shown by the veins being distended. According to\r\nGratiolet, “the pupils are always contracted in rage,” and I hear from\r\nDr. Crichton Browne that this is the case in the fierce delirium of\r\nmeningitis; but the movements of the iris under the influence of the\r\ndifferent emotions is a very obscure subject.[1008]\r\n\r\nShakspeare sums up the chief characteristics of rage as follows:—\r\n\r\n“In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man,\r\nAs modest stillness and humility;\r\nBut when the blast of war blows in our ears,\r\nThen imitate the action of the tiger:\r\nStiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\r\nThen lend the eye a terrible aspect;\r\nNow set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide,\r\nHold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit\r\nTo his full height! On, on, you noblest English.”\r\n_Henry V_., act iii. sc. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lips are sometimes protruded during rage in a manner, the meaning\r\nof which I do not understand, unless it depends on our descent from\r\nsome ape-like animal. Instances have been observed, not only with\r\nEuropeans, but with the Australians and Hindoos. The lips, however, are\r\nmuch more commonly retracted, the grinning or clenched teeth being thus\r\nexposed. This has been noticed by almost every one who has written on\r\nexpression.[1009] The appearance is as if the teeth were uncovered,\r\nready for seizing or tearing an enemy, though there may be no intention\r\nof acting in this manner. Mr. Dyson Lacy has seen this grinning\r\nexpression with the Australians, when quarrelling, and so has Gaika\r\nwith the Kafirs of South America. Dickens,[1010] in speaking of an\r\natrocious murderer who had just been caught, and was surrounded by a\r\nfurious mob, describes “the people as jumping up one behind another,\r\nsnarling with their teeth, and making at him like wild beasts.” Every\r\none who has had much to do with young children must have seen how\r\nnaturally they take to biting, when in a passion. It seems as\r\ninstinctive in them as in young crocodiles, who snap their little jaws\r\nas soon as they emerge from the egg.\r\n\r\nA grinning expression and the protrusion of the lips appear sometimes\r\nto go together. A close observer says that he has seen many instances\r\nof intense hatred (which can hardly be distinguished from rage, more or\r\nless suppressed) in Orientals, and once in an elderly English woman. In\r\nall these cases there “was a grin, not a scowl—the lips lengthening,\r\nthe cheeks settling downwards, the eyes half-closed, whilst the brow\r\nremained perfectly calm.”[1011]\r\n\r\nThis retraction of the lips and uncovering of the teeth during\r\nparoxysms of rage, as if to bite the offender, is so remarkable,\r\nconsidering how seldom the teeth are used by men in fighting, that I\r\ninquired from Dr. J. Crichton Browne whether the habit was common in\r\nthe insane whose passions are unbridled. He informs me that he has\r\nrepeatedly observed it both with the insane and idiotic, and has given\r\nme the following illustrations:—\r\n\r\nShortly before receiving my letter, he witnessed an uncontrollable\r\noutbreak of anger and delusive jealousy in an insane lady. At first she\r\nvituperated her husband, and whilst doing so foamed at the mouth. Next\r\nshe approached close to him with compressed lips, and a virulent set\r\nfrown. Then she drew back her lips, especially the corners of the upper\r\nlip, and showed her teeth, at the same time aiming a vicious blow at\r\nhim. A second case is that of an old soldier, who, when he is requested\r\nto conform to the rules of the establishment, gives way to discontent,\r\nterminating in fury. He commonly begins by asking Dr. Browne whether he\r\nis not ashamed to treat him in such a manner. He then swears and\r\nblasphemes, paces tip and down, tosses his arms wildly about, and\r\nmenaces any one near him. At last, as his exasperation culminates, he\r\nrushes up towards Dr. Browne with a peculiar sidelong movement, shaking\r\nhis doubled fist, and threatening destruction. Then his upper lip may\r\nbe seen to be raised, especially at the corners, so that his huge\r\ncanine teeth are exhibited. He hisses forth his curses through his set\r\nteeth, and his whole expression assumes the character of extreme\r\nferocity. A similar description is applicable to another man, excepting\r\nthat he generally foams at the mouth and spits, dancing and jumping\r\nabout in a strange rapid manner, shrieking out his maledictions in a\r\nshrill falsetto voice.\r\n\r\nDr. Browne also informs me of the case of an epileptic idiot, incapable\r\nof independent movements, and who spends the whole day in playing with\r\nsome toys; but his temper is morose and easily roused into fierceness.\r\nWhen any one touches his toys, he slowly raises his head from its\r\nhabitual downward position, and fixes his eyes on the offender, with a\r\ntardy yet angry scowl. If the annoyance be repeated, he draws back his\r\nthick lips and reveals a prominent row of hideous fangs (large canines\r\nbeing especially noticeable), and then makes a quick and cruel clutch\r\nwith his open hand at the offending person. The rapidity of this\r\nclutch, as Dr. Browne remarks, is marvellous in a being ordinarily so\r\ntorpid that he takes about fifteen seconds, when attracted by any\r\nnoise, to turn his head from one side to the other. If, when thus\r\nincensed, a handkerchief, book, or other article, be placed into his\r\nhands, he drags it to his mouth and bites it. Mr. Nicol has likewise\r\ndescribed to me two cases of insane patients, whose lips are retracted\r\nduring paroxysms of rage.\r\n\r\nDr. Maudsley, after detailing various strange animal-like traits in\r\nidiots, asks whether these are not due to the reappearance of primitive\r\ninstincts—“a faint echo from a far-distant past, testifying to a\r\nkinship which man has almost outgrown.” He adds, that as every human\r\nbrain passes, in the course of its development, through the same stages\r\nas those occurring in the lower vertebrate animals, and as the brain of\r\nan idiot is in an arrested condition, we may presume that it “will\r\nmanifest its most primitive functions, and no higher functions.” Dr.\r\nMaudsley thinks that the same view may be extended to the brain in its\r\ndegenerated condition in some insane patients; and asks, whence come\r\n“the savage snarl, the destructive disposition, the obscene language,\r\nthe wild howl, the offensive habits, displayed by some of the insane?\r\nWhy should a human being, deprived of his reason, ever become so brutal\r\nin character, as some do, unless he has the brute nature within\r\nhim?”[1012] This question must, as it would appear, he answered in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n_Anger, Indignation_.—These states of the mind differ from rage only in\r\ndegree, and there is no marked distinction in their characteristic\r\nsigns. Under moderate anger the action of the heart is a little\r\nincreased, the colour heightened, and the eyes become bright. The\r\nrespiration is likewise a little hurried; and as all the muscles\r\nserving for this function act in association, the wings of the nostrils\r\nare somewhat raised to allow of a free indraught of air; and this is a\r\nhighly characteristic sign of indignation. The mouth is commonly\r\ncompressed, and there is almost always a frown on the brow. Instead of\r\nthe frantic gestures of extreme rage, an indignant man unconsciously\r\nthrows himself into an attitude ready for attacking or striking his\r\nenemy, whom he will perhaps scan from head to foot in defiance. He\r\ncarries his head erect, with his chest well expanded, and the feet\r\nplanted firmly on the ground. He holds his arms in various positions,\r\nwith one or both elbows squared, or with the arms rigidly suspended by\r\nhis sides. With Europeans the fists are commonly clenched.[1013] The\r\nfigures 1 and 2 in Plate VI. are fairly good representations of men\r\nsimulating indignation. Any one may see in a mirror, if he will vividly\r\nimagine that he has been insulted and demands an explanation in an\r\nangry tone of voice, that he suddenly and unconsciously throws himself\r\ninto some such attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnger and Indignation.  Plate VI\r\n\r\nRage, anger, and indignation are exhibited in nearly the same manner\r\nthroughout the world; and the following descriptions may be worth\r\ngiving as evidence of this, and as illustrations of some of the\r\nforegoing remarks. There is, however, an exception with respect to\r\nclenching the fists, which seems confined chiefly to the men who fight\r\nwith their fists. With the Australians only one of my informants has\r\nseen the fists clenched. All agree about the body being held erect; and\r\nall, with two exceptions, state that the brows are heavily contracted.\r\nSome of them allude to the firmly-compressed mouth, the distended\r\nnostrils, and flashing eyes. According to the Rev. Mr. Taplin, rage,\r\nwith the Australians, is expressed by the lips being protruded, the\r\neyes being widely open; and in the case of the women by their dancing\r\nabout and casting dust into the air. Another observer speaks of the\r\nnative men, when enraged, throwing their arms wildly about.\r\n\r\nI have received similar accounts, except as to the clenching of the\r\nfists, in regard to the Malays of the Malacca peninsula, the\r\nAbyssinians, and the natives of South Africa. So it is with the Dakota\r\nIndians of North America; and, according to Mr. Matthews, they then\r\nhold their heads erect, frown, and often stalk away with long strides.\r\nMr. Bridges states that the Fuegians, when enraged, frequently stamp on\r\nthe ground, walk distractedly about, sometimes cry and grow pale. The\r\nRev. Mr. Stack watched a New Zealand man and woman quarrelling, and\r\nmade the following entry in his note-book: “Eyes dilated, body swayed\r\nviolently backwards and forwards, head inclined forwards, fists\r\nclenched, now thrown behind the body, now directed towards each other’s\r\nfaces.” Mr. Swinhoe says that my description agrees with what he has\r\nseen of the Chinese, excepting that an angry man generally inclines his\r\nbody towards his antagonist, and pointing at him, pours forth a volley\r\nof abuse.\r\n\r\nLastly, with respect to the natives of India, Mr. J. Scott has sent me\r\na full description of their gestures and expression when enraged. Two\r\nlow-caste Bengalees disputed about a loan. At first they were calm, but\r\nsoon grew furious and poured forth the grossest abuse on each other’s\r\nrelations and progenitors for many generations past. Their gestures\r\nwere very different from those of Europeans; for though their chests\r\nwere expanded and shoulders squared, their arms remained rigidly\r\nsuspended, with the elbows turned inwards and the hands alternately\r\nclenched and opened. Their shoulders were often raised high, and then\r\nagain lowered. They looked fiercely at each other from under their\r\nlowered and strongly wrinkled brows, and their protruded lips were\r\nfirmly closed. They approached each other, with heads and necks\r\nstretched forwards, and pushed, scratched, and grasped at each other.\r\nThis protrusion of the head and body seems a common gesture with the\r\nenraged; and I have noticed it with degraded English women whilst\r\nquarrelling violently in the streets. In such cases it may be presumed\r\nthat neither party expects to receive a blow from the other.\r\n\r\nA Bengalee employed in the Botanic Gardens was accused, in the presence\r\nof Mr. Scott, by the native overseer of having stolen a valuable plant.\r\nHe listened silently and scornfully to the accusation; his attitude\r\nerect, chest expanded, mouth closed, lips protruding, eyes firmly set\r\nand penetrating. He then defiantly maintained his innocence, with\r\nupraised and clenched hands, his head being now pushed forwards, with\r\nthe eyes widely open and eyebrows raised. Mr. Scott also watched two\r\nMechis, in Sikhim, quarrelling about their share of payment. They soon\r\ngot into a furious passion, and then their bodies became less erect,\r\nwith their heads pushed forwards; they made grimaces at each other;\r\ntheir shoulders were raised; their arms rigidly bent inwards at the\r\nelbows, and their hands spasmodically closed, but not properly\r\nclenched. They continually approached and retreated from each other,\r\nand often raised their arms as if to strike, but their hands were open,\r\nand no blow was given. Mr. Scott made similar observations on the\r\nLepchas whom he often saw quarrelling, and he noticed that they kept\r\ntheir arms rigid and almost parallel to their bodies, with the hands\r\npushed somewhat backwards and partially closed, but not clenched.\r\n\r\n_Sneering, Defiance: Uncovering the canine tooth on one side_.—The\r\nexpression which I wish here to consider differs but little from that\r\nalready described, when the lips are retracted and the grinning teeth\r\nexposed. The difference consists solely in the upper lip being\r\nretracted in such a manner that the canine tooth on one side of the\r\nface alone is shown; the face itself being generally a little upturned\r\nand half averted from the person causing offence. The other signs of\r\nrage are not necessarily present. This expression may occasionally be\r\nobserved in a person who sneers at or defies another, though there may\r\nbe no real anger; as when any one is playfully accused of some fault,\r\nand answers, “I scorn the imputation.” The expression is not a common\r\none, but I have seen it exhibited with perfect distinctness by a lady\r\nwho was being quizzed by another person. It was described by Parsons as\r\nlong ago as 1746, with an engraving, showing the uncovered canine on\r\none side.[1014] Mr. Rejlander, without my having made any allusion to\r\nthe subject, asked me whether I had ever noticed this expression, as he\r\nhad been much struck by it. He has photographed for me (Plate IV. fig\r\n1) a lady, who sometimes unintentionally displays the canine on one\r\nside, and who can do so voluntarily with unusual distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe expression of a half-playful sneer graduates into one of great\r\nferocity when, together with a heavily frowning brow and fierce eye,\r\nthe canine tooth is exposed. A Bengalee boy was accused before Mr.\r\nScott of some misdeed. The delinquent did not dare to give vent to his\r\nwrath in words, but it was plainly shown on his countenance, sometimes\r\nby a defiant frown, and sometimes “by a thoroughly canine snarl.” When\r\nthis was exhibited, “the corner of the lip over the eye-tooth, which\r\nhappened in this case to be large and projecting, was raised on the\r\nside of his accuser, a strong frown being still retained on the brow.”\r\nSir C. Bell states[1015] that the actor Cooke could express the most\r\ndetermined hate “when with the oblique cast of his eyes he drew up the\r\nouter part of the upper lip, and discovered a sharp angular tooth.”\r\n\r\nThe uncovering of the canine tooth is the result of a double movement.\r\nThe angle or corner of the mouth is drawn a little backwards, and at\r\nthe same time a muscle which runs parallel to and near the nose draws\r\nup the outer part of the upper lip, and exposes the canine on this side\r\nof the face. The contraction of this muscle makes a distinct furrow on\r\nthe cheek, and produces strong wrinkles under the eye, especially at\r\nits inner corner. The action is the same as that of a snarling dog; and\r\na dog when pretending to fight often draws up the lip on one side\r\nalone, namely that facing his antagonist. Our word _sneer_ is in fact\r\nthe same as _snarl_, which was originally _snar_, the _l_ “being merely\r\nan element implying continuance of action.”[1016]\r\n\r\nI suspect that we see a trace of this same expression in what is called\r\na derisive or sardonic smile. The lips are then kept joined or almost\r\njoined, but one corner of the mouth is retracted on the side towards\r\nthe derided person; and this drawing back of the corner is part of a\r\ntrue sneer. Although some persons smile more on one side of their face\r\nthan on the other, it is not easy to understand why in cases of\r\nderision the smile, if a real one, should so commonly be confined to\r\none side. I have also on these occasions noticed a slight twitching of\r\nthe muscle which draws up the outer part of the upper lip; and this\r\nmovement, if fully carried out, would have uncovered the canine, and\r\nwould have produced a true sneer.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulmer, an Australian missionary in a remote part of Gipps’ Land,\r\nsays, in answer to my query about the uncovering of the canine on one\r\nside, “I find that the natives in snarling at each other speak with the\r\nteeth closed, the upper lip drawn to one side, and a general angry\r\nexpression of face; but they look direct at the person addressed.”\r\nThree other observers in Australia, one in Abyssinia, and one in China,\r\nanswer my query on this head in the affirmative; but as the expression\r\nis rare, and as they enter into no details, I am afraid of implicitly\r\ntrusting them. It is, however, by no means improbable that this\r\nanimal-like expression may be more common with savages than with\r\ncivilized races. Mr. Geach is an observer who may be fully trusted, and\r\nhe has observed it on one occasion in a Malay in the interior of\r\nMalacca. The Rev. S. O. Glenie answers, “We have observed this\r\nexpression with the natives of Ceylon, but not often.” Lastly, in North\r\nAmerica, Dr. Rothrock has seen it with some wild Indians, and often in\r\na tribe adjoining the Atnahs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the upper lip is certainly sometimes raised on one side alone\r\nin sneering at or defying any one, I do not know that this is always\r\nthe case, for the face is commonly half averted, and the expression is\r\noften momentary. The movement being confined to one side may not be an\r\nessential part of the expression, but may depend on the proper muscles\r\nbeing incapable of movement excepting on one side. I asked four persons\r\nto endeavour to act voluntarily in this manner; two could expose the\r\ncanine only on the left side, one only on the right side, and the\r\nfourth on neither side. Nevertheless it is by no means certain that\r\nthese same persons, if defying any one in earnest, would not\r\nunconsciously have uncovered their canine tooth on the side, whichever\r\nit might be, towards the offender. For we have seen that some persons\r\ncannot voluntarily make their eyebrows oblique, yet instantly act in\r\nthis manner when affected by any real, although most trifling, cause of\r\ndistress. The power of voluntarily uncovering the canine on one side of\r\nthe face being thus often wholly lost, indicates that it is a rarely\r\nused and almost abortive action. It is indeed a surprising fact that\r\nman should possess the power, or should exhibit any tendency to its\r\nuse; for Mr. Sutton has never noticed a snarling action in our nearest\r\nallies, namely, the monkeys in the Zoological Gardens, and he is\r\npositive that the baboons, though furnished with great canines, never\r\nact thus, but uncover all their teeth when feeling savage and ready for\r\nan attack. Whether the adult anthropomorphous apes, in the males of\r\nwhom the canines are much larger than in the females, uncover them when\r\nprepared to fight, is not known.\r\n\r\nThe expression here considered, whether that of a playful sneer or\r\nferocious snarl, is one of the most curious which occurs in man. It\r\nreveals his animal descent; for no one, even if rolling on the ground\r\nin a deadly grapple with an enemy, and attempting to bite him, would\r\ntry to use his canine teeth more than his other teeth. We may readily\r\nbelieve from our affinity to the anthropomorphous apes that our male\r\nsemi-human progenitors possessed great canine teeth, and men are now\r\noccasionally born having them of unusually large size, with interspaces\r\nin the opposite jaw for their reception.[1017] We may further suspect,\r\nnotwithstanding that we have no support from analogy, that our\r\nsemi-human progenitors uncovered their canine teeth when prepared for\r\nbattle, as we still do when feeling ferocious, or when merely sneering\r\nat or defying some one, without any intention of making a real attack\r\nwith our teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. DISDAIN—CONTEMPT—DISGUST-GUILT—PRIDE,\r\nETC.—HELPLESSNESS—PATIENCE—AFFIRMATION AND NEGATION.\r\n\r\nContempt, scorn and disdain, variously expressed—Derisive\r\nsmile—Gestures expressive of contempt—Disgust—Guilt, deceit, pride,\r\n&c.—Helplessness or impotence—Patience—Obstinacy—Shrugging the\r\nshoulders common to most of the races of man—Signs of affirmation and\r\nnegation.\r\n\r\nScorn and disdain can hardly be distinguished from contempt, excepting\r\nthat they imply a rather more angry frame of mind. Nor can they be\r\nclearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter\r\nunder the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather\r\nmore distinct in its nature and refers to something revolting,\r\nprimarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or\r\nvividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar\r\nfeeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight.\r\nNevertheless, extreme contempt, or as it is often called loathing\r\ncontempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the\r\nmind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited\r\nin many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode\r\nof expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance\r\nM. Lemoine has argued[1101] that their descriptions are not\r\ntrustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the\r\nfeelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many\r\ndifferent ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally\r\nwell, through the principle of association, for their expression.\r\n\r\nScorn and disdain, as well as sneering and defiance, may be displayed\r\nby a slight uncovering of the canine tooth on one side of the face; and\r\nthis movement appears to graduate into one closely like a smile. Or the\r\nsmile or laugh may be real, although one of derision; and this implies\r\nthat the offender is so insignificant that he excites only amusement;\r\nbut the amusement is generally a pretence. Gaika in his answers to my\r\nqueries remarks, that contempt is commonly shown by his countrymen, the\r\nKafirs, by smiling; and the Rajah Brooke makes the same observation\r\nwith respect to the Dyaks of Borneo. As laughter is primarily the\r\nexpression of simple joy, very young children do not, I believe, ever\r\nlaugh in derision.\r\n\r\nThe partial closure of the eyelids, as Duchenne[1102] insists, or the\r\nturning away of the eyes or of the whole body, are likewise highly\r\nexpressive of disdain. These actions seem to declare that the despised\r\nperson is not worth looking at or is disagreeable to behold. The\r\naccompanying photograph (Plate V. fig. 1) by Mr. Rejlander, shows this\r\nform of disdain. It represents a young lady, who is supposed to be\r\ntearing up the photograph of a despised lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScorn and Disdain.  Plate V\r\n\r\nThe most common method of expressing contempt is by movements about the\r\nnose, or round the mouth; but the latter movements, when strongly\r\npronounced, indicate disgust. The nose may be slightly turned up, which\r\napparently follows from the turning up of the upper lip; or the\r\nmovement may be abbreviated into the mere wrinkling of the nose. The\r\nnose is often slightly contracted, so as partly to close the\r\npassage;[1103] and this is commonly accompanied by a slight snort or\r\nexpiration. All these actions are the same with those which we employ\r\nwhen we perceive an offensive odour, and wish to exclude or expel it.\r\nIn extreme cases, as Dr. Piderit remarks,[1104] we protrude and raise\r\nboth lips, or the upper lip alone, so as to close the nostrils as by a\r\nvalve, the nose being thus turned up. We seem thus to say to the\r\ndespised person that he smells offensively,[1105] in nearly the same\r\nmanner as we express to him by half-closing our eyelids, or turning\r\naway our faces, that he is not worth looking at. It must not, however,\r\nbe supposed that such ideas actually pass through the mind when we\r\nexhibit our contempt; but as whenever we have perceived a disagreeable\r\nodour or seen a disagreeable sight, actions of this kind have been\r\nperformed, they have become habitual or fixed, and are now employed\r\nunder any analogous state of mind.\r\n\r\nVarious odd little gestures likewise indicate contempt; for instance,\r\n_snapping one’s fingers_. This, as Mr. Taylor remarks,[1106] “is not\r\nvery intelligible as we generally see it; but when we notice that the\r\nsame sign made quite gently, as if rolling some tiny object away\r\nbetween the finger and thumb, or the sign of flipping it away with the\r\nthumb-nail and forefinger, are usual and well-understood deaf-and-dumb\r\ngestures, denoting anything tiny, insignificant, contemptible, it seems\r\nas though we had exaggerated and conventionalized a perfectly natural\r\naction, so as to lose sight of its original meaning. There is a curious\r\nmention of this gesture by Strabo.” Mr. Washington Matthews informs me\r\nthat, with the Dakota Indians of North America, contempt is shown not\r\nonly by movements of the face, such as those above described, but\r\n“conventionally, by the hand being closed and held near the breast,\r\nthen, as the forearm is suddenly extended, the hand is opened and the\r\nfingers separated from each other. If the person at whose expense the\r\nsign is made is present, the hand is moved towards him, and the head\r\nsometimes averted from him.” This sudden extension and opening of the\r\nhand perhaps indicates the dropping or throwing away a valueless\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe term ‘disgust,’ in its simplest sense, means something offensive to\r\nthe taste. It is curious how readily this feeling is excited by\r\nanything unusual in the appearance, odour, or nature of our food. In\r\nTierra del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved\r\nmeat which I was eating at our bivouac, and plainly showed utter\r\ndisgust at its softness; whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being\r\ntouched by a naked savage, though his hands did not appear dirty. A\r\nsmear of soup on a man’s beard looks disgusting, though there is of\r\ncourse nothing disgusting in the soup itself. I presume that this\r\nfollows from the strong association in our minds between the sight of\r\nfood, however circumstanced, and the idea of eating it.\r\n\r\nAs the sensation of disgust primarily arises in connection with the act\r\nof eating or tasting, it is natural that its expression should consist\r\nchiefly in movements round the mouth. But as disgust also causes\r\nannoyance, it is generally accompanied by a frown, and often by\r\ngestures as if to push away or to guard oneself against the offensive\r\nobject. In the two photographs (figs. 2 and 3, on Plate V.) Mr.\r\nRejlander has simulated this expression with some success. With respect\r\nto the face, moderate disgust is exhibited in various ways; by the\r\nmouth being widely opened, as if to let an offensive morsel drop out;\r\nby spitting; by blowing out of the protruded lips; or by a sound as of\r\nclearing the throat. Such guttural sounds are written _ach_ or _ugh_;\r\nand their utterance is sometimes accompanied by a shudder, the arms\r\nbeing pressed close to the sides and the shoulders raised in the same\r\nmanner as when horror is experienced.[1107] Extreme disgust is\r\nexpressed by movements round the month identical with those preparatory\r\nto the act of vomiting. The mouth is opened widely, with the upper lip\r\nstrongly retracted, which wrinkles the sides of the nose, and with the\r\nlower lip protruded and everted as much as possible. This latter\r\nmovement requires the contraction of the muscles which draw downwards\r\nthe corners of the mouth.[1108]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how readily and instantly retching or actual vomiting\r\nis induced in some persons by the mere idea of having partaken of any\r\nunusual food, as of an animal which is not commonly eaten; although\r\nthere is nothing in such food to cause the stomach to reject it. When\r\nvomiting results, as a reflex action, from some real cause—as from too\r\nrich food, or tainted meat, or from an emetic—it does not ensue\r\nimmediately, but generally after a considerable interval of time.\r\nTherefore, to account for retching or vomiting being so quickly and\r\neasily excited by a mere idea, the suspicion arises that our\r\nprogenitors must formerly have had the power (like that possessed by\r\nruminants and some other animals) of voluntarily rejecting food which\r\ndisagreed with them, or which they thought would disagree with them;\r\nand now, though this power has been lost, as far as the will is\r\nconcerned, it is called into involuntary action, through the force of a\r\nformerly well-established habit, whenever the mind revolts at the idea\r\nof having partaken of any kind of food, or at anything disgusting. This\r\nsuspicion receives support from the fact, of which I am assured by Mr.\r\nSutton, that the monkeys in the Zoological Gardens often vomit whilst\r\nin perfect health, which looks as if the act were voluntary. We can see\r\nthat as man is able to communicate by language to his children and\r\nothers, the knowledge of the kinds of food to be avoided, he would have\r\nlittle occasion to use the faculty of voluntary rejection; so that this\r\npower would tend to be lost through disuse.\r\n\r\nAs the sense of smell is so intimately connected with that of taste, it\r\nis not surprising that an excessively bad odour should excite retching\r\nor vomiting in some persons, quite as readily as the thought of\r\nrevolting food does; and that, as a further consequence, a moderately\r\noffensive odour should cause the various expressive movements of\r\ndisgust. The tendency to retch from a fetid odour is immediately\r\nstrengthened in a curious manner by some degree of habit, though soon\r\nlost by longer familiarity with the cause of offence and by voluntary\r\nrestraint. For instance, I wished to clean the skeleton of a bird,\r\nwhich had not been sufficiently macerated, and the smell made my\r\nservant and myself (we not having had much experience in such work)\r\nretch so violently, that we were compelled to desist. During the\r\nprevious days I had examined some other skeletons, which smelt\r\nslightly; yet the odour did not in the least affect me, but,\r\nsubsequently for several days, whenever I handled these same skeletons,\r\nthey made me retch.\r\n\r\nFrom the answers received from my correspondents it appears that the\r\nvarious movements, which have now been described as expressing contempt\r\nand disgust, prevail throughout a large part of the world. Dr.\r\nRothrock, for instance, answers with a decided affirmative with respect\r\nto certain wild Indian tribes of North America. Crantz says that when a\r\nGreenlander denies anything with contempt or horror he turns up his\r\nnose, and gives a slight sound through it.[1109] Mr. Scott has sent me\r\na graphic description of the face of a young Hindoo at the sight of\r\ncastor-oil, which he was compelled occasionally to take. Mr. Scott has\r\nalso seen the same expression on the faces of high-caste natives who\r\nhave approached close to some defiling object. Mr. Bridges says that\r\nthe Fuegians “express contempt by shooting out the lips and hissing\r\nthrough them, and by turning up the nose.” The tendency either to snort\r\nthrough the nose, or to make a noise expressed by _ugh_ or _ach_, is\r\nnoticed by several of my correspondents.\r\n\r\nSpitting seems an almost universal sign of contempt or disgust; and\r\nspitting obviously represents the rejection of anything offensive from\r\nthe mouth. Shakspeare makes the Duke of Norfolk say, “I spit at\r\nhim—call him a slanderous coward and a villain.” So, again, Falstaff\r\nsays, “Tell thee what, Hal,—if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face.”\r\nLeichhardt remarks that the Australians “interrupted their speeches by\r\nspitting, and uttering a noise like pooh! pooh! apparently expressive\r\nof their disgust.” And Captain Burton speaks of certain negroes\r\n“spitting with disgust upon the ground.” Captain Speedy informs me that\r\nthis is likewise the case with the Abyssinians. Mr. Geach says that\r\nwith the Malays of Malacca the expression of disgust “answers to\r\nspitting from the mouth;” and with the Fuegians, according to Mr.\r\nBridges “to spit at one is the highest mark of contempt.”[1110]\r\n\r\nI never saw disgust more plainly expressed than on the face of one of\r\nmy infants at the age of five months, when, for the first time, some\r\ncold water, and again a month afterwards, when a piece of ripe cherry\r\nwas put into his mouth. This was shown by the lips and whole mouth\r\nassuming a shape which allowed the contents to run or fall quickly out;\r\nthe tongue being likewise protruded. These movements were accompanied\r\nby a little shudder. It was all the more comical, as I doubt whether\r\nthe child felt real disgust—the eyes and forehead expressing much\r\nsurprise and consideration. The protrusion of the tongue in letting a\r\nnasty object fall out of the mouth, may explain how it is that lolling\r\nout the tongue universally serves as a sign of contempt and\r\nhatred.[1111]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that scorn, disdain, contempt, and disgust are\r\nexpressed in many different ways, by movements of the features, and by\r\nvarious gestures; and that these are the same throughout the world.\r\nThey all consist of actions representing the rejection or exclusion of\r\nsome real object which we dislike or abhor, but which does not excite\r\nin us certain other strong emotions, such as rage or terror; and\r\nthrough the force of habit and association similar actions are\r\nperformed, whenever any analogous sensation arises in our minds.\r\n\r\n_Jealousy, Envy, Avarice, Revenge, Suspicion, Deceit, Slyness, Guilt,\r\nVanity, Conceit, Ambition, Pride, Humility, &c_.—It is doubtful whether\r\nthe greater number of the above complex states of mind are revealed by\r\nany fixed expression, sufficiently distinct to be described or\r\ndelineated. When Shakspeare speaks of Envy as _lean-faced_, or _black_,\r\nor _pale_, and Jealousy as “_the green-eyed monster_;” and when Spenser\r\ndescribes Suspicion as “_foul, ill-favoured, and grim_,” they must have\r\nfelt this difficulty. Nevertheless, the above feelings—at least many of\r\nthem—can be detected by the eye; for instance, conceit; but we are\r\noften guided in a much greater degree than we suppose by our previous\r\nknowledge of the persons or circumstances.\r\n\r\nMy correspondents almost unanimously answer in the affirmative to my\r\nquery, whether the expression of guilt and deceit can be recognized\r\namongst the various races of man; and I have confidence in their\r\nanswers, as they generally deny that jealousy can thus be recognized.\r\nIn the cases in which details are given, the eyes are almost always\r\nreferred to. The guilty man is said to avoid looking at his accuser, or\r\nto give him stolen looks. The eyes are said “to be turned askant,” or\r\n“to waver from side to side,” or “the eyelids to be lowered and partly\r\nclosed.” This latter remark is made by Mr. Hagenauer with respect to\r\nthe Australians, and by Gaika with respect to the Kafirs. The restless\r\nmovements of the eyes apparently follow, as will be explained when we\r\ntreat of blushing, from the guilty man not enduring to meet the gaze of\r\nhis accuser. I may add, that I have observed a guilty expression,\r\nwithout a shade of fear, in some of my own children at a very early\r\nage. In one instance the expression was unmistakably clear in a child\r\ntwo years and seven months old, and led to the detection of his little\r\ncrime. It was shown, as I record in my notes made at the time, by an\r\nunnatural brightness in the eyes, and by an odd, affected manner,\r\nimpossible to describe.\r\n\r\nSlyness is also, I believe, exhibited chiefly by movements about the\r\neyes; for these are less under the control of the will, owing to the\r\nforce of long-continued habit, than are the movements of the body. Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer remarks,[1112] “When there is a desire to see something\r\non one side of the visual field without being supposed to see it, the\r\ntendency is to check the conspicuous movement of the head, and to make\r\nthe required adjustment entirely with the eyes; which are, therefore,\r\ndrawn very much to one side. Hence, when the eyes are turned to one\r\nside, while the face is not turned to the same side, we get the natural\r\nlanguage of what is called slyness.”\r\n\r\nOf all the above-named complex emotions, Pride, perhaps, is the most\r\nplainly expressed. A proud man exhibits his sense of superiority over\r\nothers by holding his head and body erect. He is haughty (_haut_), or\r\nhigh, and makes himself appear as large as possible; so that\r\nmetaphorically he is said to be swollen or puffed up with pride. A\r\npeacock or a turkey-cock strutting about with puffed-up feathers, is\r\nsometimes said to be an emblem of pride.[1113] The arrogant man looks\r\ndown on others, and with lowered eyelids hardly condescends to see\r\nthem; or he may show his contempt by slight movements, such as those\r\nbefore described, about the nostrils or lips. Hence the muscle which\r\neverts the lower lip has been called the _musculus superbus_. In some\r\nphotographs of patients affected by a monomania of pride, sent me by\r\nDr. Crichton Browne, the head and body were held erect, and the mouth\r\nfirmly closed. This latter action, expressive of decision, follows, I\r\npresume, from the proud man feeling perfect self-confidence in himself.\r\nThe whole expression of pride stands in direct antithesis to that of\r\nhumility; so that nothing need here be said of the latter state of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n_Helplessness, Impotence: Shrugging the shoulders_.—When a man wishes\r\nto show that he cannot do something, or prevent something being done,\r\nhe often raises with a quick movement both shoulders. At the same time,\r\nif the whole gesture is completed, he bends his elbows closely inwards,\r\nraises his open hands, turning them outwards, with the fingers\r\nseparated. The head is often thrown a little on one side; the eyebrows\r\nare elevated, and this causes wrinkles across the forehead. The mouth\r\nis generally opened. I may mention, in order to show how unconsciously\r\nthe features are thus acted on, that though I had often intentionally\r\nshrugged my shoulders to observe how my arms were placed, I was not at\r\nall aware that my eyebrows were raised and mouth opened, until I looked\r\nat myself in a glass; and since then I have noticed the same movements\r\nin the faces of others. In the accompanying Plate VI., figs. 3 and 4,\r\nMr. Rejlander has successfully acted the gesture of shrugging the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen are much less demonstrative than the men of most other\r\nEuropean nations, and they shrug their shoulders far less frequently\r\nand energetically than Frenchmen or Italians do. The gesture varies in\r\nall degrees from the complex movement, just described, to only a\r\nmomentary and scarcely perceptible raising of both shoulders; or, as I\r\nhave noticed in a lady sitting in an arm-chair, to the mere turning\r\nslightly outwards of the open hands with separated fingers. I have\r\nnever seen very young English children shrug their shoulders, but the\r\nfollowing case was observed with care by a medical professor and\r\nexcellent observer, and has been communicated to me by him. The father\r\nof this gentleman was a Parisian, and his mother a Scotch lady. His\r\nwife is of British extraction on both sides, and my informant does not\r\nbelieve that she ever shrugged her shoulders in her life. His children\r\nhave been reared in England, and the nursemaid is a thorough\r\nEnglishwoman, who has never been seen to shrug her shoulders. Now, his\r\neldest daughter was observed to shrug her shoulders at the age of\r\nbetween sixteen and eighteen months; her mother exclaiming at the time,\r\n“Look at the little French girl shrugging her shoulders!” At first she\r\noften acted thus, sometimes throwing her head a little backwards and on\r\none side, but she did not, as far as was observed, move her elbows and\r\nhands in the usual manner. The habit gradually wore away, and now, when\r\nshe is a little over four years old, she is never seen to act thus. The\r\nfather is told that he sometimes shrugs his shoulders, especially when\r\narguing with any one; but it is extremely improbable that his daughter\r\nshould have imitated him at so early an age; for, as he remarks, she\r\ncould not possibly have often seen this gesture in him. Moreover, if\r\nthe habit had been acquired through imitation, it is not probable that\r\nit would so soon have been spontaneously discontinued by this child,\r\nand, as we shall immediately see, by a second child, though the father\r\nstill lived with his family. This little girl, it may be added,\r\nresembles her Parisian grandfather in countenance to an almost absurd\r\ndegree. She also presents another and very curious resemblance to him,\r\nnamely, by practising a singular trick. When she impatiently wants\r\nsomething, she holds out her little hand, and rapidly rubs the thumb\r\nagainst the index and middle finger: now this same trick was frequently\r\nperformed under the same circumstances by her grandfather.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman’s second daughter also shrugged her shoulders before the\r\nage of eighteen months, and afterwards discontinued the habit. It is of\r\ncourse possible that she may have imitated her elder sister; but she\r\ncontinued it after her sister had lost the habit. She at first\r\nresembled her Parisian grandfather in a less degree than did her sister\r\nat the same age, but now in a greater degree. She likewise practises to\r\nthe present time the peculiar habit of rubbing together, when\r\nimpatient, her thumb and two of her fore-fingers.\r\n\r\nIn this latter case we have a good instance, like those given in a\r\nformer chapter, of the inheritance of a trick or gesture; for no one, I\r\npresume, will attribute to mere coincidence so peculiar a habit as\r\nthis, which was common to the grandfather and his two grandchildren who\r\nhad never seen him.\r\n\r\nConsidering all the circumstances with reference to these children\r\nshrugging their shoulders, it can hardly be doubted that they have\r\ninherited the habit from their French progenitors, although they have\r\nonly one quarter French blood in their veins, and although their\r\ngrandfather did not often shrug his shoulders. There is nothing very\r\nunusual, though the fact is interesting, in these children having\r\ngained by inheritance a habit during early youth, and then\r\ndiscontinuing it; for it is of frequent occurrence with many kinds of\r\nanimals that certain characters are retained for a period by the young,\r\nand are then lost.\r\n\r\nAs it appeared to me at one time improbable in a high degree that so\r\ncomplex a gesture as shrugging the shoulders, together with the\r\naccompanying movements, should be innate, I was anxious to ascertain\r\nwhether the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman, who could not have learnt\r\nthe habit by imitation, practised it. And I have heard, through Dr.\r\nInnes, from a lady who has lately had charge of her, that she does\r\nshrug her shoulders, turn in her elbows, and raise her eyebrows in the\r\nsame manner as other people, and under the same circumstances. I was\r\nalso anxious to learn whether this gesture was practised by the various\r\nraces of man, especially by those who never have had much intercourse\r\nwith Europeans. We shall see that they act in this manner; but it\r\nappears that the gesture is sometimes confined to merely raising or\r\nshrugging the shoulders, without the other movements.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott has frequently seen this gesture in the Bengalees and\r\nDhangars (the latter constituting a distinct race) who are employed in\r\nthe Botanic Garden at Calcutta; when, for instance, they have declared\r\nthat they could not do some work, such as lifting a heavy weight. He\r\nordered a Bengalee to climb a lofty tree; but the man, with a shrug of\r\nhis shoulders and a lateral shake of his head, said he could not. Mr.\r\nScott knowing that the man was lazy, thought he could, and insisted on\r\nhis trying. His face now became pale, his arms dropped to his sides,\r\nhis mouth and eyes were widely opened, and again surveying the tree, he\r\nlooked askant at Mr. Scott, shrugged his shoulders, inverted his\r\nelbows, extended his open hands, and with a few quick lateral shakes of\r\nthe head declared his inability. Mr. H. Erskine has likewise seen the\r\nnatives of India shrugging their shoulders; but he has never seen the\r\nelbows turned so much inwards as with us; and whilst shrugging their\r\nshoulders they sometimes lay their uncrossed hands on their breasts.\r\n\r\nWith the wild Malays of the interior of Malacca, and with the Bugis\r\n(true Malays, though speaking a different language), Mr. Geach has\r\noften seen this gesture. I presume that it is complete, as, in answer\r\nto my query descriptive of the movements of the shoulders, arms, hands,\r\nand face, Mr. Geach remarks, “it is performed in a beautiful style.” I\r\nhave lost an extract from a scientific voyage, in which shrugging the\r\nshoulders by some natives (Micronesians) of the Caroline Archipelago in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, was well described. Capt. Speedy informs me that the\r\nAbyssinians shrug their shoulders but enters into no details. Mrs. Asa\r\nGray saw an Arab dragoman in Alexandria acting exactly as described in\r\nmy query, when an old gentleman, on whom he attended, would not go in\r\nthe proper direction which had been pointed out to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington Matthews says, in reference to the wild Indian tribes of\r\nthe western parts of the United States, “I have on a few occasions\r\ndetected men using a slight apologetic shrug, but the rest of the\r\ndemonstration which you describe I have not witnessed.” Fritz Müller\r\ninforms me that he has seen the negroes in Brazil shrugging their\r\nshoulders; but it is of course possible that they may have learnt to do\r\nso by imitating the Portuguese. Mrs. Barber has never seen this gesture\r\nwith the Kafirs of South Africa; and Gaika, judging from his answer,\r\ndid not even understand what was meant by my description. Mr. Swinhoe\r\nis also doubtful about the Chinese; but he has seen them, under the\r\ncircumstances which would make us shrug our shoulders, press their\r\nright elbow against their side, raise their eyebrows, lift up their\r\nhand with the palm directed towards the person addressed, and shake it\r\nfrom right to left. Lastly, with respect to the Australians, four of my\r\ninformants answer by a simple negative, and one by a simple\r\naffirmative. Mr. Bunnett, who has had excellent opportunities for\r\nobservation on the borders of the Colony of Victory, also answers by a\r\n“yes,” adding that the gesture is performed “in a more subdued and less\r\ndemonstrative manner than is the case with civilized nations.” This\r\ncircumstance may account for its not having been noticed by four of my\r\ninformants.\r\n\r\nThese statements, relating to Europeans, Hindoos, the hill-tribes of\r\nIndia, Malays, Micronesians, Abyssinians, Arabs, Negroes, Indians of\r\nNorth America, and apparently to the Australians—many of these natives\r\nhaving had scarcely any intercourse with Europeans—are sufficient to\r\nshow that shrugging the shoulders, accompanied in some cases by the\r\nother proper movements, is a gesture natural to mankind.\r\n\r\nThis gesture implies an unintentional or unavoidable action on our own\r\npart, or one that we cannot perform; or an action performed by another\r\nperson which we cannot prevent. It accompanies such speeches as, “It\r\nwas not my fault;” “It is impossible for me to grant this favour;” “He\r\nmust follow his own course, I cannot stop him.” Shrugging the shoulders\r\nlikewise expresses patience, or the absence of any intention to resist.\r\nHence the muscles which raise the shoulders are sometimes called, as I\r\nhave been informed by an artist, the patience muscles. Shylock the Jew,\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n“Signor Antonio, many a time and oft\r\nIn the Rialto have you rated me\r\nAbout my monies and usances;\r\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug.”\r\n_Merchant of Venice_, act i. sc. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir C. Bell has given[1114] a life-like figure of a man, who is\r\nshrinking back from some terrible danger, and is on the point of\r\nscreaming out in abject terror. He is represented with his shoulders\r\nlifted up almost to his ears; and this at once declares that there is\r\nno thought of resistance.\r\n\r\nAs shrugging the shoulders generally implies “I cannot do this or\r\nthat,” so by a slight change, it sometimes implies “I won’t do it.” The\r\nmovement then expresses a dogged determination not to act. Olmsted\r\ndescribes[1115] an Indian in Texas as giving a great shrug to his\r\nshoulders, when he was informed that a party of men were Germans and\r\nnot Americans, thus expressing that he would have nothing to do with\r\nthem. Sulky and obstinate children may be seen with both their\r\nshoulders raised high up; but this movement is not associated with the\r\nothers which generally accompany a true shrug. An excellent\r\nobserver[1116] in describing a young man who was determined not to\r\nyield to his father’s desire, says, “He thrust his hands deep down into\r\nhis pockets, and set up his shoulders to his ears, which was a good\r\nwarning that, come right or wrong, this rock should fly from its firm\r\nbase as soon as Jack would; and that any remonstrance on the subject\r\nwas purely futile.” As soon as the son got his own way, he “put his\r\nshoulders into their natural position.”\r\n\r\nResignation is sometimes shown by the open hands being placed, one over\r\nthe other, on the lower part of the body. I should not have thought\r\nthis little gesture worth even a passing notice, had not Dr. W. Ogle\r\nremarked to me that he had two or three times observed it in patients\r\nwho were preparing for operations under chloroform. They exhibited no\r\ngreat fear, but seemed to declare by this posture of their hands, that\r\nthey had made up their minds, and were resigned to the inevitable.\r\n\r\nWe may now inquire why men in all parts of the world when they\r\nfeel,—whether or not they wish to show this feeling,—that they cannot\r\nor will not do something, or will not resist something if done by\r\nanother, shrug their shoulders, at the same time often bending in their\r\nelbows, showing the palms of their hands with extended fingers, often\r\nthrowing their heads a little on one side, raising their eyebrows, and\r\nopening their mouths. These states of the mind are either simply\r\npassive, or show a determination not to act. None of the above\r\nmovements are of the least service. The explanation lies, I cannot\r\ndoubt, in the principle of unconscious antithesis. This principle here\r\nseems to come into play as clearly as in the case of a dog, who, when\r\nfeeling savage, puts himself in the proper attitude for attacking and\r\nfor making himself appear terrible to his enemy; but as soon as he\r\nfeels affectionate, throws his whole body into a directly opposite\r\nattitude, though this is of no direct use to him.\r\n\r\nLet it be observed how an indignant man, who resents, and will not\r\nsubmit to some injury, holds his head erect, squares his shoulders, and\r\nexpands his chest. He often clenches his fists, and puts one or both\r\narms in the proper position for attack or defence, with the muscles of\r\nhis limbs rigid. He frowns,—that is, he contracts and lowers his\r\nbrows,—and, being determined, closes his mouth. The actions and\r\nattitude of a helpless man are, in every one of these respects, exactly\r\nthe reverse. In Plate VI. we may imagine one of the figures on the left\r\nside to have just said, “What do you mean by insulting me?” and one of\r\nthe figures on the right side to answer, “I really could not help it.”\r\nThe helpless man unconsciously contracts the muscles of his forehead\r\nwhich are antagonistic to those that cause a frown, and thus raises his\r\neyebrows; at the same time he relaxes the muscles about the mouth, so\r\nthat the lower jaw drops. The antithesis is complete in every detail,\r\nnot only in the movements of the features, but in the position of the\r\nlimbs and in the attitude of the whole body, as may be seen in the\r\naccompanying plate. As the helpless or apologetic man often wishes to\r\nshow his state of mind, he then acts in a conspicuous or demonstrative\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the fact that squaring the elbows and clenching the\r\nfists are gestures by no means universal with the men of all races,\r\nwhen they feel indignant and are prepared to attack their enemy, so it\r\nappears that a helpless or apologetic frame of mind is expressed in\r\nmany parts of the world by merely shrugging the shoulders, without\r\nturning inwards the elbows and opening the hands. The man or child who\r\nis obstinate, or one who is resigned to some great misfortune, has in\r\nneither case any idea of resistance by active means; and he expresses\r\nthis state of mind, by simply keeping his shoulders raised; or he may\r\npossibly fold his arms across his breast.\r\n\r\n_Signs of affirmation or approval, and of negation or disapproval:\r\nnodding and shaking the head_.—I was curious to ascertain how far the\r\ncommon signs used by us in affirmation and negation were general\r\nthroughout the world. These signs are indeed to a certain extent\r\nexpressive of our feelings, as we give a vertical nod of approval with\r\na smile to our children, when we approve of their conduct; and shake\r\nour heads laterally with a frown, when we disapprove. With infants, the\r\nfirst act of denial consists in refusing food; and I repeatedly noticed\r\nwith my own infants, that they did so by withdrawing their heads\r\nlaterally from the breast, or from anything offered them in a spoon. In\r\naccepting food and taking it into their mouths, they incline their\r\nheads forwards. Since making these observations I have been informed\r\nthat the same idea had occurred to Charma.[1117] It deserves notice\r\nthat in accepting or taking food, there is only a single movement\r\nforward, and a single nod implies an affirmation. On the other hand, in\r\nrefusing food, especially if it be pressed on them, children frequently\r\nmove their heads several times from side to side, as we do in shaking\r\nour heads in negation. Moreover, in the case of refusal, the head is\r\nnot rarely thrown backwards, or the mouth is closed, so that these\r\nmovements might likewise come to serve as signs of negation. Mr.\r\nWedgwood remarks on this subject,[1118] that “when the voice is exerted\r\nwith closed teeth or lips, it produces the sound of the letter _n_ or\r\n_m_. Hence we may account for the use of the particle _ne_ to signify\r\nnegation, and possibly also of the Greek mh in the same sense.”\r\n\r\nThat these signs are innate or instinctive, at least with Anglo-Saxons,\r\nis rendered highly probable by the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman\r\n“constantly accompanying her _yes_ with the common affirmative nod, and\r\nher _no_ with our negative shake of the head.” Had not Mr. Lieber\r\nstated to the contrary,[1119] I should have imagined that these\r\ngestures might have been acquired or learnt by her, considering her\r\nwonderful sense of touch and appreciation of the movements of others.\r\nWith microcephalous idiots, who are so degraded that they never learn\r\nto speak, one of them is described by Vogt,[1120] as answering, when\r\nasked whether he wished for more food or drink, by inclining or shaking\r\nhis head. Schmalz, in his remarkable dissertation on the education of\r\nthe deaf and dumb, as well as of children raised only one degree above\r\nidiotcy, assumes that they can always both make and understand the\r\ncommon signs of affirmation and negation.[1121]\r\n\r\nNevertheless if we look to the various races of man, these signs are\r\nnot so universally employed as I should have expected; yet they seem\r\ntoo general to be ranked as altogether conventional or artificial. My\r\ninformants assert that both signs are used by the Malays, by the\r\nnatives of Ceylon, the Chinese, the negroes of the Guinea coast, and,\r\naccording to Gaika, by the Kafirs of South Africa, though with these\r\nlatter people Mrs. Barber has never seen a lateral shake used as a\r\nnegative. With respect to the Australians, seven observers agree that a\r\nnod is given in affirmation; five agree about a lateral shake in\r\nnegation, accompanied or not by some word; but Mr. Dyson Lacy has never\r\nseen this latter sign in Queensland, and Mr. Bulmer says that in Gipps’\r\nLand a negative is expressed by throwing the head a little backwards\r\nand putting out the tongue. At the northern extremity of the continent,\r\nnear Torres Straits, the natives when uttering a negative “don’t shake\r\nthe head with it, but holding up the right hand, shake it by turning it\r\nhalf round and back again two or three times.”[1122] The throwing back\r\nof the head with a cluck of the tongue is said to be used as a negative\r\nby the modern Greeks and Turks, the latter people expressing _yes_ by a\r\nmovement like that made by us when we shake our heads.[1123] The\r\nAbyssinians, as I am informed by Captain Speedy, express a negative by\r\njerking the head to the right shoulder, together with a slight cluck,\r\nthe mouth being closed; an affirmation is expressed by the head being\r\nthrown backwards and the eyebrows raised for an instant. The Tagals of\r\nLuzon, in the Philippine Archipelago, as I hear from Dr. Adolf Meyer,\r\nwhen they say “yes,” also throw the head backwards. According to the\r\nRajah Brooke, the Dyaks of Borneo express an affirmation by raising the\r\neyebrows, and a negation by slightly contracting them, together with a\r\npeculiar look from the eyes. With the Arabs on the Nile, Professor and\r\nMrs. Asa Gray concluded that nodding in affirmation was rare, whilst\r\nshaking the head in negation was never used, and was not even\r\nunderstood by them. With the Esquimaux[1124] a nod means _yes_ and a\r\nwink _no_. The New Zealanders “elevate the head and chin in place of\r\nnodding acquiescence.”[1125]\r\n\r\nWith the Hindoos Mr. H. Erskine concludes from inquiries made from\r\nexperienced Europeans, and from native gentlemen, that the signs of\r\naffirmation and negation vary—a nod and a lateral shake being sometimes\r\nused as we do; but a negative is more commonly expressed by the head\r\nbeing thrown suddenly backwards and a little to one side, with a cluck\r\nof the tongue. What the meaning may be of this cluck of the tongue,\r\nwhich has been observed with various people, I cannot imagine. A native\r\ngentleman stated that affirmation is frequently shown by the head being\r\nthrown to the left. I asked Mr. Scott to attend particularly to this\r\npoint, and, after repeated observations, he believes that a vertical\r\nnod is not commonly used by the natives in affirmation, but that the\r\nhead is first thrown backwards either to the left or right, and then\r\njerked obliquely forwards only once. This movement would perhaps have\r\nbeen described by a less careful observer as a lateral shake. He also\r\nstates that in negation the head is usually held nearly upright, and\r\nshaken several times.\r\n\r\nMr. Bridges informs me that the Fuegians nod their heads vertically in\r\naffirmation, and shake them laterally in denial. With the wild Indians\r\nof North America, according to Mr. Washington Matthews, nodding and\r\nshaking the head have been learnt from Europeans, and are not naturally\r\nemployed. They express affirmation by describing with the hand (all the\r\nfingers except the index being flexed) a curve downwards and outwards\r\nfrom the body, whilst negation is expressed by moving the open hand\r\noutwards, with the palm facing inwards. Other observers state that the\r\nsign of affirmation with these Indians is the forefinger being raised,\r\nand then lowered and pointed to the ground, or the hand is waved\r\nstraight forward from the face; and that the sign of negation is the\r\nfinger or whole hand shaken from side to side.[1126] This latter\r\nmovement probably represents in all cases the lateral shaking of the\r\nhead. The Italians are said in like manner to move the lifted finger\r\nfrom right to left in negation, as indeed we English sometimes do.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we find considerable diversity in the signs of affirmation\r\nand negation in the different races of man. With respect to negation,\r\nif we admit that the shaking of the finger or hand from side to side is\r\nsymbolic of the lateral movement of the head; and if we admit that the\r\nsudden backward movement of the head represents one of the actions\r\noften practised by young children in refusing food, then there is much\r\nuniformity throughout the world in the signs of negation, and we can\r\nsee how they originated. The most marked exceptions are presented by\r\nthe Arabs, Esquimaux, some Australian tribes, and Dyaks. With the\r\nlatter a frown is the sign of negation, and with us frowning often\r\naccompanies a lateral shake of the head.\r\n\r\nWith respect to nodding in affirmation, the exceptions are rather more\r\nnumerous, namely with some of the Hindoos, with the Turks, Abyssinians,\r\nDyaks, Tagals, and New Zealanders. The eyebrows are sometimes raised in\r\naffirmation, and as a person in bending his head forwards and downwards\r\nnaturally looks up to the person whom he addresses, he will be apt to\r\nraise his eyebrows, and this sign may thus have arisen as an\r\nabbreviation. So again with the New Zealanders, the lifting up the chin\r\nand head in affirmation may perhaps represent in an abbreviated form\r\nthe upward movement of the head after it has been nodded forwards and\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. SURPRISE—ASTONISHMENT—FEAR—HORROR.\r\n\r\nSurprise, astonishment—Elevation of the eyebrows—Opening the\r\nmouth—Protrusion of the lips—Gestures accompanying\r\nsurprise—Admiration—Fear—Terror—Erection of the hair—Contraction of the\r\nplatysma muscle—Dilatation of the pupils—Horror—Conclusion.\r\n\r\nAttention, if sudden and close, graduates into surprise; and this into\r\nastonishment; and this into stupefied amazement. The latter frame of\r\nmind is closely akin to terror. Attention is shown by the eyebrows\r\nbeing slightly raised; and as this state increases into surprise, they\r\nare raised to a much greater extent, with the eyes and mouth widely\r\nopen. The raising of the eyebrows is necessary in order that the eyes\r\nshould be opened quickly and widely; and this movement produces\r\ntransverse wrinkles across the forehead. The degree to which the eyes\r\nand mouth are opened corresponds with the degree of surprise felt; but\r\nthese movements must be coordinated; for a widely opened mouth with\r\neyebrows only slightly raised results in a meaningless grimace, as Dr.\r\nDuchenne has shown in one of his photographs.[1201] On the other hand,\r\na person may often be seen to pretend surprise by merely raising his\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\nDr. Duchenne has given a photograph of an old man with his eyebrows\r\nwell elevated and arched by the galvanization of the frontal muscle;\r\nand with his mouth voluntarily opened. This figure expresses surprise\r\nwith much truth. I showed it to twenty-four persons without a word of\r\nexplanation, and one alone did not at all understand what was intended.\r\nA second person answered terror, which is not far wrong; some of the\r\nothers, however, added to the words surprise or astonishment, the\r\nepithets horrified, woful, painful, or disgusted.\r\n\r\nThe eyes and mouth being widely open is an expression universally\r\nrecognized as one of surprise or astonishment. Thus Shakespeare says,\r\n“I saw a smith stand with open mouth swallowing a tailor’s news.”\r\n(‘King John,’ act iv. scene ii.) And again, “They seemed almost, with\r\nstaring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was\r\nspeech in the dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as\r\nthey had heard of a world destroyed.” (‘Winter’s Tale,’ act v. scene\r\nii.)\r\n\r\nMy informants answer with remarkable uniformity to the same effect,\r\nwith respect to the various races of man; the above movements of the\r\nfeatures being often accompanied by certain gestures and sounds,\r\npresently to be described. Twelve observers in different parts of\r\nAustralia agree on this head. Mr. Winwood Reade has observed this\r\nexpression with the negroes on the Guinea coast. The chief Gaika and\r\nothers answer _yes_ to my query with respect to the Kafirs of South\r\nAfrica; and so do others emphatically with reference to the\r\nAbyssinians, Ceylonese, Chinese, Fuegians, various tribes of North\r\nAmerica, and New Zealanders. With the latter, Mr. Stack states that the\r\nexpression is more plainly shown by certain individuals than by others,\r\nthough all endeavour as much as possible to conceal their feelings. The\r\nDyaks of Borneo are said by the Rajah Brooke to open their eyes widely,\r\nwhen astonished, often swinging their heads to and fro, and beating\r\ntheir breasts. Mr. Scott informs me that the workmen in the Botanic\r\nGardens at Calcutta are strictly ordered not to smoke; but they often\r\ndisobey this order, and when suddenly surprised in the act, they first\r\nopen their eyes and mouths widely. They then often slightly shrug their\r\nshoulders, as they perceive that discovery is inevitable, or frown and\r\nstamp on the ground from vexation. Soon they recover from their\r\nsurprise, and abject fear is exhibited by the relaxation of all their\r\nmuscles; their heads seem to sink between their shoulders; their fallen\r\neyes wander to and fro; and they supplicate forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Australian explorer, Mr. Stuart, has given[1202] a\r\nstriking account of stupefied amazement together with terror in a\r\nnative who had never before seen a man on horseback. Mr. Stuart\r\napproached unseen and called to him from a little distance. “He turned\r\nround and saw me. What he imagined I was I do not know; but a finer\r\npicture of fear and astonishment I never saw. He stood incapable of\r\nmoving a limb, riveted to the spot, mouth open and eyes staring.... He\r\nremained motionless until our black got within a few yards of him, when\r\nsuddenly throwing down his waddies, he jumped into a mulga bush as high\r\nas he could get.” He could not speak, and answered not a word to the\r\ninquiries made by the black, but, trembling from head to foot, “waved\r\nwith his hand for us to be off.”\r\n\r\nThat the eyebrows are raised by an innate or instinctive impulse may be\r\ninferred from the fact that Laura Bridgman invariably acts thus when\r\nastonished, as I have been assured by the lady who has lately had\r\ncharge of her. As surprise is excited by something unexpected or\r\nunknown, we naturally desire, when startled, to perceive the cause as\r\nquickly as possible; and we consequently open our eyes fully, so that\r\nthe field of vision may be increased, and the eyeballs moved easily in\r\nany direction. But this hardly accounts for the eyebrows being so\r\ngreatly raised as is the case, and for the wild staring of the open\r\neyes. The explanation lies, I believe, in the impossibility of opening\r\nthe eyes with great rapidity by merely raising the upper lids. To\r\neffect this the eyebrows must be lifted energetically. Any one who will\r\ntry to open his eyes as quickly as possible before a mirror will find\r\nthat he acts thus; and the energetic lifting up of the eyebrows opens\r\nthe eyes so widely that they stare, the white being exposed all round\r\nthe iris. Moreover, the elevation of the eyebrows is an advantage in\r\nlooking upwards; for as long as they are lowered they impede our vision\r\nin this direction. Sir C. Bell gives[1203] a curious little proof of\r\nthe part which the eyebrows play in opening the eyelids. In a stupidly\r\ndrunken man all the muscles are relaxed, and the eyelids consequently\r\ndroop, in the same manner as when we are falling asleep. To counteract\r\nthis tendency the drunkard raises his eyebrows; and this gives to him a\r\npuzzled, foolish look, as is well represented in one of Hogarth’s\r\ndrawings. The habit of raising the eyebrows having once been gained in\r\norder to see as quickly as possible all around us, the movement would\r\nfollow from the force of association whenever astonishment was felt\r\nfrom any cause, even from a sudden sound or an idea.\r\n\r\nWith adult persons, when the eyebrows are raised, the whole forehead\r\nbecomes much wrinkled in transverse lines; but with children this\r\noccurs only to a slight degree. The wrinkles run in lines concentric\r\nwith each eyebrow, and are partially confluent in the middle. They are\r\nhighly characteristic of the expression of surprise or astonishment.\r\nEach eyebrow, when raised, becomes also, as Duchenne remarks,[1204]\r\nmore arched than it was before.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the mouth being opened when astonishment is felt, is a\r\nmuch more complex affair; and several causes apparently concur in\r\nleading to this movement. It has often been supposed[1205] that the\r\nsense of hearing is thus rendered more acute; but I have watched\r\npersons listening intently to a slight noise, the nature and source of\r\nwhich they knew perfectly, and they did not open their mouths.\r\nTherefore I at one time imagined that the open mouth might aid in\r\ndistinguishing the direction whence a sound proceeded, by giving\r\nanother channel for its entrance into the ear through the eustachian\r\ntube, But Dr. W. Ogle[1206] has been so kind as to search the best\r\nrecent authorities on the functions of the eustachian tube, and he\r\ninforms me that it is almost conclusively proved that it remains closed\r\nexcept during the act of deglutition; and that in persons in whom the\r\ntube remains abnormally open, the sense of hearing, as far as external\r\nsounds are concerned, is by no means improved; on the contrary, it is\r\nimpaired by the respiratory sounds being rendered more distinct. If a\r\nwatch be placed within the mouth, but not allowed to touch the sides,\r\nthe ticking is heard much less plainly than when held outside. In\r\npersons in whom from disease or a cold the eustachian tube is\r\npermanently or temporarily closed, the sense of hearing is injured; but\r\nthis may be accounted for by mucus accumulating within the tube, and\r\nthe consequent exclusion of air. We may therefore infer that the mouth\r\nis not kept open under the sense of astonishment for the sake of\r\nhearing sounds more distinctly; notwithstanding that most deaf people\r\nkeep their mouths open.\r\n\r\nEvery sudden emotion, including astonishment, quickens the action of\r\nthe heart, and with it the respiration. Now we can breathe, as\r\nGratiolet remarks[1207] and as appears to me to be the case, much more\r\nquietly through the open mouth than through the nostrils. Therefore,\r\nwhen we wish to listen intently to any sound, we either stop breathing,\r\nor breathe as quietly as possible, by opening our mouths, at the same\r\ntime keeping our bodies motionless. One of my sons was awakened in the\r\nnight by a noise under circumstances which naturally led to great care,\r\nand after a few minutes he perceived that his mouth was widely open. He\r\nthen became conscious that he had opened it for the sake of breathing\r\nas quietly as possible. This view receives support from the reversed\r\ncase which occurs with dogs. A dog when panting after exercise, or on a\r\nhot day, breathes loudly; but if his attention be suddenly aroused, he\r\ninstantly pricks his ears to listen, shuts his mouth, and breathes\r\nquietly, as he is enabled to do, through his nostrils.\r\n\r\nWhen the attention is concentrated for a length of time with fixed\r\nearnestness on any object or subject, all the organs of the body are\r\nforgotten and neglected;[1208] and as the nervous energy of each\r\nindividual is limited in amount, little is transmitted to any part of\r\nthe system, excepting that which is at the time brought into energetic\r\naction. Therefore many of the muscles tend to become relaxed, and the\r\njaw drops from its own weight. This will account for the dropping of\r\nthe jaw and open mouth of a man stupefied with amazement, and perhaps\r\nwhen less strongly affected. I have noticed this appearance, as I find\r\nrecorded in my notes, in very young children when they were only\r\nmoderately surprised.\r\n\r\nThere is still another and highly effective cause, leading to the mouth\r\nbeing opened, when we are astonished, and more especially when we are\r\nsuddenly startled. We can draw a full and deep inspiration much more\r\neasily through the widely open mouth than through the nostrils. Now\r\nwhen we start at any sudden sound or sight, almost all the muscles of\r\nthe body are involuntarily and momentarily thrown into strong action,\r\nfor the sake of guarding ourselves against or jumping away from the\r\ndanger, which we habitually associate with anything unexpected. But we\r\nalways unconsciously prepare ourselves for any great exertion, as\r\nformerly explained, by first taking a deep and full inspiration, and we\r\nconsequently open our mouths. If no exertion follows, and we still\r\nremain astonished, we cease for a time to breathe, or breathe as\r\nquietly as possible, in order that every sound may be distinctly heard.\r\nOr again, if our attention continues long and earnestly absorbed, all\r\nour muscles become relaxed, and the jaw, which was at first suddenly\r\nopened, remains dropped. Thus several causes concur towards this same\r\nmovement, whenever surprise, astonishment, or amazement is felt.\r\n\r\nAlthough when thus affected, our mouths are generally opened, yet the\r\nlips are often a little protruded. This fact reminds us of the same\r\nmovement, though in a much more strongly marked degree, in the\r\nchimpanzee and orang when astonished. As a strong expiration naturally\r\nfollows the deep inspiration which accompanies the first sense of\r\nstartled surprise, and as the lips are often protruded, the various\r\nsounds which are then commonly uttered can apparently be accounted for.\r\nBut sometimes a strong expiration alone is heard; thus Laura Bridgman,\r\nwhen amazed, rounds and protrudes her lips, opens them, and breathes\r\nstrongly.[1209] One of the commonest sounds is a deep _Oh_; and this\r\nwould naturally follow, as explained by Helmholtz, from the mouth being\r\nmoderately opened and the lips protruded. On a quiet night some rockets\r\nwere fired from the ‘Beagle,’ in a little creek at Tahiti, to amuse the\r\nnatives; and as each rocket, was let off there was absolute silence,\r\nbut this was invariably followed by a deep groaning _Oh_, resounding\r\nall round the bay. Mr. Washington Matthews says that the North American\r\nIndians express astonishment by a groan; and the negroes on the West\r\nCoast of Africa, according to Mr. Winwood Reade, protrude their lips,\r\nand make a sound like _heigh, heigh_. If the mouth is not much opened,\r\nwhilst the lips are considerably protruded, a blowing, hissing, or\r\nwhistling noise is produced. Mr. R. Brough Smith informs me that an\r\nAustralian from the interior was taken to the theatre to see an acrobat\r\nrapidly turning head over heels: “he was greatly astonished, and\r\nprotruded his lips, making a noise with his mouth as if blowing out a\r\nmatch.” According to Mr. Bulmer the Australians, when surprised, utter\r\nthe exclamation _korki_, “and to do this the mouth is drawn out as if\r\ngoing to whistle.” We Europeans often whistle as a sign of surprise;\r\nthus, in a recent novel[1210] it is said, “here the man expressed his\r\nastonishment and disapprobation by a prolonged whistle.” A Kafir girl,\r\nas Mr. J. Mansel Weale informs me, “on hearing of the high price of an\r\narticle, raised her eyebrows and whistled just as a European would.”\r\nMr. Wedgwood remarks that such sounds are written down as _whew_, and\r\nthey serve as interjections for surprise.\r\n\r\nAccording to three other observers, the Australians often evince\r\nastonishment by a clucking noise. Europeans also sometimes express\r\ngentle surprise by a little clicking noise of nearly the same kind. We\r\nhave seen that when we are startled, the mouth is suddenly opened; and\r\nif the tongue happens to be then pressed closely against the palate,\r\nits sudden withdrawal will produce a sound of this kind, which might\r\nthus come to express surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGestures of the Body. Plate VII\r\n\r\nTurning to gestures of the body. A surprised person often raises his\r\nopened hands high above his head, or by bending his arms only to the\r\nlevel of his face. The flat palms are directed towards the person who\r\ncauses this feeling, and the straightened fingers are separated. This\r\ngesture is represented by Mr. Rejlander in Plate VII. fig. 1. In the\r\n‘Last Supper,’ by Leonardo da Vinci, two of the Apostles have their\r\nhands half uplifted, clearly expressive of their astonishment. A\r\ntrustworthy observer told me that he had lately met his wife under most\r\nunexpected circumstances: “She started, opened her mouth and eyes very\r\nwidely, and threw up both her arms above her head.” Several years ago I\r\nwas surprised by seeing several of my young children earnestly doing\r\nsomething together on the ground; but the distance was too great for me\r\nto ask what they were about. Therefore I threw up my open hands with\r\nextended fingers above my head; and as soon as I had done this, I\r\nbecame conscious of the action. I then waited, without saying a word,\r\nto see if my children had understood this gesture; and as they came\r\nrunning to me they cried out, “We saw that you were astonished at us.”\r\nI do not know whether this gesture is common to the various races of\r\nman, as I neglected to make inquiries on this head. That it is innate\r\nor natural may be inferred from the fact that Laura Bridgman, when\r\namazed, “spreads her arms and turns her hands with extended fingers\r\nupwards;”[1211] nor is it likely, considering that the feeling of\r\nsurprise is generally a brief one, that she should have learnt this\r\ngesture through her keen sense of touch.\r\n\r\nHuschke describes[1212] a somewhat different yet allied gesture, which\r\nhe says is exhibited by persons when astonished. They hold themselves\r\nerect, with the features as before described, but with the straightened\r\narms extended backwards—the stretched fingers being separated from each\r\nother. I have never myself seen this gesture; but Huschke is probably\r\ncorrect; for a friend asked another man how he would express great\r\nastonishment, and he at once threw himself into this attitude.\r\n\r\nThese gestures are, I believe, explicable on the principle of\r\nantithesis. We have seen that an indignant man holds his head erect,\r\nsquares his shoulders, turns out his elbows, often clenches his fist,\r\nfrowns, and closes his mouth; whilst the attitude of a helpless man is\r\nin every one of these details the reverse. Now, a man in an ordinary\r\nframe of mind, doing nothing and thinking of nothing in particular,\r\nusually keeps his two arms suspended laxly by his sides, with his hands\r\nsomewhat flexed, and the fingers near together. Therefore, to raise the\r\narms suddenly, either the whole arms or the fore-arms, to open the\r\npalms flat, and to separate the fingers,—or, again, to straighten the\r\narms, extending them backwards with separated fingers,—are movements in\r\ncomplete antithesis to those preserved under an indifferent frame of\r\nmind, and they are, in consequence, unconsciously assumed by an\r\nastonished man. There is, also, often a desire to display surprise in a\r\nconspicuous manner, and the above attitudes are well fitted for this\r\npurpose. It may be asked why should surprise, and only a few other\r\nstates of the mind, be exhibited by movements in antithesis to others.\r\nBut this principle will not be brought into play in the case of those\r\nemotions, such as terror, great joy, suffering, or rage, which\r\nnaturally lead to certain lines of action and produce certain effects\r\non the body, for the whole system is thus preoccupied; and these\r\nemotions are already thus expressed with the greatest plainness.\r\n\r\nThere is another little gesture, expressive of astonishment of which I\r\ncan offer no explanation; namely, the hand being placed over the mouth\r\nor on some part of the head. This has been observed with so many races\r\nof man, that it must have some natural origin. A wild Australian was\r\ntaken into a large room full of official papers, which surprised him\r\ngreatly, and he cried out, _cluck, cluck, cluck_, putting the back of\r\nhis hand towards his lips. Mrs. Barber says that the Kafirs and Fingoes\r\nexpress astonishment by a serious look and by placing the right hand\r\nupon the mouth, uttering the word _mawo_, which means ‘wonderful.’ The\r\nBushmen are said[1213] to put their right hands to their necks, bending\r\ntheir heads backwards. Mr. Winwood Reade has observed that the negroes\r\non the West Coast of Africa, when surprised, clap their hands to their\r\nmouths, saying at the same time, “My mouth cleaves to me,” i. e. to my\r\nhands; and he has heard that this is their usual gesture on such\r\noccasions. Captain Speedy informs me that the Abyssinians place their\r\nright hand to the forehead, with the palm outside. Lastly, Mr.\r\nWashington Matthews states that the conventional sign of astonishment\r\nwith the wild tribes of the western parts of the United States “is made\r\nby placing the half-closed hand over the mouth; in doing this, the head\r\nis often bent forwards, and words or low groans are sometimes uttered.”\r\nCatlin[1214] makes the same remark about the hand being pressed over\r\nthe mouth by the Mandans and other Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n_Admiration_.—Little need be said on this head. Admiration apparently\r\nconsists of surprise associated with some pleasure and a sense of\r\napproval. When vividly felt, the eyes are opened and the eyebrows\r\nraised; the eyes become bright, instead of remaining blank, as under\r\nsimple astonishment; and the mouth, instead of gaping open, expands\r\ninto a smile.\r\n\r\n_Fear, Terror_.—The word ‘fear’ seems to be derived from what is sudden\r\nand dangerous;[1215] and that of terror from the trembling of the vocal\r\norgans and body. I use the word ‘terror’ for extreme fear; but some\r\nwriters think it ought to be confined to cases in which the imagination\r\nis more particularly concerned. Fear is often preceded by astonishment,\r\nand is so far akin to it, that both lead to the senses of sight and\r\nhearing being instantly aroused. In both cases the eyes and mouth are\r\nwidely opened, and the eyebrows raised. The frightened man at first\r\nstands like a statue motionless and breathless, or crouches down as if\r\ninstinctively to escape observation.\r\n\r\nThe heart beats quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks\r\nagainst the ribs; but it is very doubtful whether it then works more\r\nefficiently than usual, so as to send a greater supply of blood to all\r\nparts of the body; for the skin instantly becomes pale, as during\r\nincipient faintness. This paleness of the surface, however, is probably\r\nin large part, or exclusively, due to the vasomotor centre being\r\naffected in such a manner as to cause the contraction of the small\r\narteries of the skin. That the skin is much affected under the sense of\r\ngreat fear, we see in the marvellous and inexplicable manner in which\r\nperspiration immediately exudes from it. This exudation is all the more\r\nremarkable, as the surface is then cold, and hence the term a cold\r\nsweat; whereas, the sudorific glands are properly excited into action\r\nwhen the surface is heated. The hairs also on the skin stand erect; and\r\nthe superficial muscles shiver. In connection with the disturbed action\r\nof the heart, the breathing is hurried. The salivary glands act\r\nimperfectly; the mouth becomes dry,[1216] and is often opened and shut.\r\nI have also noticed that under slight fear there is a strong tendency\r\nto yawn. One of the best-marked symptoms is the trembling of all the\r\nmuscles of the body; and this is often first seen in the lips. From\r\nthis cause, and from the dryness of the mouth, the voice becomes husky\r\nor indistinct, or may altogether fail. “Obstupui, steteruntque comae,\r\net vox faucibus haesit.”\r\n\r\nOf vague fear there is a well-known and grand description in Job:—“In\r\nthoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,\r\nfear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.\r\nThen a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. It\r\nstood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was\r\nbefore my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, Shall\r\nmortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his\r\nMaker?” (Job iv. 13)\r\n\r\nAs fear increases into an agony of terror, we behold, as under all\r\nviolent emotions, diversified results. The heart beats wildly, or may\r\nfail to act and faintness ensue; there is a death-like pallor; the\r\nbreathing is laboured; the wings of the nostrils are wildly dilated;\r\n“there is a gasping and convulsive motion of the lips, a tremor on the\r\nhollow cheek, a gulping and catching of the throat;”[1217] the\r\nuncovered and protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object of terror; or\r\nthey may roll restlessly from side to side, _huc illuc volvens oculos\r\ntotumque pererrat_.[1218] The pupils are said to be enormously dilated.\r\nAll the muscles of the body may become rigid, or may be thrown into\r\nconvulsive movements. The hands are alternately clenched and opened,\r\noften with a twitching movement. The arms may be protruded, as if to\r\navert some dreadful danger, or may be thrown wildly over the head. The\r\nRev. Mr. Hagenauer has seen this latter action in a terrified\r\nAustralian. In other cases there is a sudden and uncontrollable\r\ntendency to headlong flight; and so strong is this, that the boldest\r\nsoldiers may be seized with a sudden panic.\r\n\r\nAs fear rises to an extreme pitch, the dreadful scream of terror is\r\nheard. Great beads of sweat stand on the skin. All the muscles of the\r\nbody are relaxed. Utter prostration soon follows, and the mental powers\r\nfail. The intestines are affected. The sphincter muscles cease to act,\r\nand no longer retain the contents of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotograph of an Insane Woman. Fig. 19\r\n\r\nDr. J. Crichton Browne has given me so striking an account of intense\r\nfear in an insane woman, aged thirty-five, that the description though\r\npainful ought not to be omitted. When a paroxysm seizes her, she\r\nscreams out, “This is hell!” “There is a black woman!” “I can’t get\r\nout!”—and other such exclamations. When thus screaming, her movements\r\nare those of alternate tension and tremor. For one instant she clenches\r\nher hands, holds her arms out before her in a stiff semi-flexed\r\nposition; then suddenly bends her body forwards, sways rapidly to and\r\nfro, draws her fingers through her hair, clutches at her neck, and\r\ntries to tear off her clothes. The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles (which\r\nserve to bend the head on the chest) stand out prominently, as if\r\nswollen, and the skin in front of them is much wrinkled. Her hair,\r\nwhich is cut short at the back of her head, and is smooth when she is\r\ncalm, now stands on end; that in front being dishevelled by the\r\nmovements of her hands. The countenance expresses great mental agony.\r\nThe skin is flushed over the face and neck, down to the clavicles, and\r\nthe veins of the forehead and neck stand out like thick cords. The\r\nlower lip drops, and is somewhat everted. The mouth is kept half open,\r\nwith the lower jaw projecting. The cheeks are hollow and deeply\r\nfurrowed in curved lines running from the wings of the nostrils to the\r\ncorners of the mouth. The nostrils themselves are raised and extended.\r\nThe eyes are widely opened, and beneath them the skin appears swollen;\r\nthe pupils are large. The forehead is wrinkled transversely in many\r\nfolds, and at the inner extremities of the eyebrows it is strongly\r\nfurrowed in diverging lines, produced by the powerful and persistent\r\ncontraction of the corrugators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTerror. Fig. 20\r\n\r\nMr. Bell has also described[1219] an agony of terror and of despair,\r\nwhich he witnessed in a murderer, whilst carried to the place of\r\nexecution in Turin. “On each side of the car the officiating priests\r\nwere seated; and in the centre sat the criminal himself. It was\r\nimpossible to witness the condition of this unhappy wretch without\r\nterror; and yet, as if impelled by some strange infatuation, it was\r\nequally impossible not to gaze upon an object so wild, so full of\r\nhorror. He seemed about thirty-five years of age; of large and muscular\r\nform; his countenance marked by strong and savage features; half naked,\r\npale as death, agonized with terror, every limb strained in anguish,\r\nhis hands clenched convulsively, the sweat breaking out on his bent and\r\ncontracted brow, he kissed incessantly the figure of our Saviour,\r\npainted on the flag which was suspended before him; but with an agony\r\nof wildness and despair, of which nothing ever exhibited on the stage\r\ncan give the slightest conception.”\r\n\r\nI will add only one other case, illustrative of a man utterly\r\nprostrated by terror. An atrocious murderer of two persons was brought\r\ninto a hospital, under the mistaken impression that he had poisoned\r\nhimself; and Dr. W. Ogle carefully watched him the next morning, while\r\nhe was being handcuffed and taken away by the police. His pallor was\r\nextreme, and his prostration so great that he was hardly able to dress\r\nhimself. His skin perspired; and his eyelids and head drooped so much\r\nthat it was impossible to catch even a glimpse of his eyes. His lower\r\njaw hung down. There was no contraction of any facial muscle, and Dr.\r\nOgle is almost certain that the hair did not stand on end, for he\r\nobserved it narrowly, as it had been dyed for the sake of concealment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to fear, as exhibited by the various races of man, my\r\ninformants agree that the signs are the same as with Europeans. They\r\nare displayed in an exaggerated degree with the Hindoos and natives of\r\nCeylon. Mr. Geach has seen Malays when terrified turn pale and shake;\r\nand Mr. Brough Smyth states that a native Australian “being on one\r\noccasion much frightened, showed a complexion as nearly approaching to\r\nwhat we call paleness, as can well be conceived in the case of a very\r\nblack man.” Mr. Dyson Lacy has seen extreme fear shown in an\r\nAustralian, by a nervous twitching of the hands, feet, and lips; and by\r\nthe perspiration standing on the skin. Many savages do not repress the\r\nsigns of fear so much as Europeans; and they often tremble greatly.\r\nWith the Kafir, Gaika says, in his rather quaint English, the shaking\r\n“of the body is much experienced, and the eyes are widely open.” With\r\nsavages, the sphincter muscles are often relaxed, just as may be\r\nobserved in much frightened dogs, and as I have seen with monkeys when\r\nterrified by being caught.\r\n\r\n_The erection of the hair_.—Some of the signs of fear deserve a little\r\nfurther consideration. Poets continually speak of the hair standing on\r\nend; Brutus says to the ghost of Caesar, “that mak’st my blood cold,\r\nand my hair to stare.” And Cardinal Beaufort, after the murder of\r\nGloucester exclaims, “Comb down his hair; look, look, it stands\r\nupright.” As I did not feel sure whether writers of fiction might not\r\nhave applied to man what they had often observed in animals, I begged\r\nfor information from Dr. Crichton Browne with respect to the insane. He\r\nstates in answer that he has repeatedly seen their hair erected under\r\nthe influence of sudden and extreme terror. For instance, it is\r\noccasionally necessary to inject morphia, under the skin of an insane\r\nwoman, who dreads the operation extremely, though it causes very little\r\npain; for she believes that poison is being introduced into her system,\r\nand that her bones will be softened, and her flesh turned into dust.\r\nShe becomes deadly pale; her limbs are stiffened by a sort of tetanic\r\nspasm, and her hair is partially erected on the front of the head.\r\n\r\nDr. Browne further remarks that the bristling of the hair which is so\r\ncommon in the insane, is not always associated with terror. It is\r\nperhaps most frequently seen in chronic maniacs, who rave incoherently\r\nand have destructive impulses; but it is during their paroxysms of\r\nviolence that the bristling is most observable. The fact of the hair\r\nbecoming erect under the influence both of rage and fear agrees\r\nperfectly with what we have seen in the lower animals. Dr. Browne\r\nadduces several cases in evidence. Thus with a man now in the Asylum,\r\nbefore the recurrence of each maniacal paroxysm, “the hair rises up\r\nfrom his forehead like the mane of a Shetland pony.” He has sent me\r\nphotographs of two women, taken in the intervals between their\r\nparoxysms, and he adds with respect to one of these women, “that the\r\nstate of her hair is a sure and convenient criterion of her mental\r\ncondition.” I have had one of these photographs copied, and the\r\nengraving gives, if viewed from a little distance, a faithful\r\nrepresentation of the original, with the exception that the hair\r\nappears rather too coarse and too much curled. The extraordinary\r\ncondition of the hair in the insane is due, not only to its erection,\r\nbut to its dryness and harshness, consequent on the subcutaneous glands\r\nfailing to act. Dr. Bucknill has said[1220] that a lunatic “is a\r\nlunatic to his finger’s ends;” he might have added, and often to the\r\nextremity of each particular hair.\r\n\r\nDr. Browne mentions as an empirical confirmation of the relation which\r\nexists in the insane between the state of their hair and minds, that\r\nthe wife of a medical man, who has charge of a lady suffering from\r\nacute melancholia, with a strong fear of death, for herself, her\r\nhusband and children, reported verbally to him the day before receiving\r\nmy letter as follows, “I think Mrs. —— will soon improve, for her hair\r\nis getting smooth; and I always notice that our patients get better\r\nwhenever their hair ceases to be rough and unmanageable.”\r\n\r\nDr. Browne attributes the persistently rough condition of the hair in\r\nmany insane patients, in part to their minds being always somewhat\r\ndisturbed, and in part to the effects of habit,—that is, to the hair\r\nbeing frequently and strongly erected during their many recurrent\r\nparoxysms. In patients in whom the bristling of the hair is extreme,\r\nthe disease is generally permanent and mortal; but in others, in whom\r\nthe bristling is moderate, as soon as they recover their health of mind\r\nthe hair recovers its smoothness.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we have seen that with animals the hairs are\r\nerected by the contraction of minute, unstriped, and involuntary\r\nmuscles, which run to each separate follicle. In addition to this\r\naction, Mr. J. Wood has clearly ascertained by experiment, as he\r\ninforms me, that with man the hairs on the front of the head which\r\nslope forwards, and those on the back which slope backwards, are raised\r\nin opposite directions by the contraction of the occipito-frontalis or\r\nscalp muscle. So that this muscle seems to aid in the erection of the\r\nhairs on the head of man in the same manner as the homologous\r\n_panniculus carnosus_ aids, or takes the greater part, in the erection\r\nof the spines on the backs of some of the lower animals.\r\n\r\n_Contraction of the platysma myoides muscle_.—This muscle is spread\r\nover the sides of the neck, extending downwards to a little beneath the\r\ncollar-bones, and upwards to the lower part of the cheeks. A portion,\r\ncalled the risorius, is represented in the woodcut (M) fig. 2. The\r\ncontraction of this muscle draws the corners of the mouth and the lower\r\nparts of the checks downwards and backwards. It produces at the same\r\ntime divergent, longitudinal, prominent ridges on the sides of the neck\r\nin the young; and, in old thin persons, fine transverse wrinkles. This\r\nmuscle is sometimes said not to be under the control of the will; but\r\nalmost every one, if told to draw the corners of his mouth backwards\r\nand downwards with great force, brings it into action. I have, however,\r\nheard of a man who can voluntarily act on it only on one side of his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nSir C. Bell[1221] and others have stated that this muscle is strongly\r\ncontracted under the influence of fear; and Duchenne insists so\r\nstrongly on its importance in the expression of this emotion, that he\r\ncalls it the _muscle of fright_.[1222] He admits, however, that its\r\ncontraction is quite inexpressive unless associated with widely open\r\neyes and mouth. He has given a photograph (copied and reduced in the\r\naccompanying woodcut) of the same old man as on former occasions, with\r\nhis eyebrows strongly raised, his mouth opened, and the platysma\r\ncontracted, all by means of galvanism. The original photograph was\r\nshown to twenty-four persons, and they were separately asked, without\r\nany explanation being given, what expression was intended: twenty\r\ninstantly answered, “intense fright” or “horror”; three said pain, and\r\none extreme discomfort. Dr. Duchenne has given another photograph of\r\nthe same old man, with the platysma contracted, the eyes and mouth\r\nopened, and the eyebrows rendered oblique, by means of galvanism. The\r\nexpression thus induced is very striking (see Plate VII. fig. 2); the\r\nobliquity of the eyebrows adding the appearance of great mental\r\ndistress. The original was shown to fifteen persons; twelve answered\r\nterror or horror, and three agony or great suffering. From these cases,\r\nand from an examination of the other photographs given by Dr. Duchenne,\r\ntogether with his remarks thereon, I think there can be little doubt\r\nthat the contraction of the platysma does add greatly to the expression\r\nof fear. Nevertheless this muscle ought hardly to be called that of\r\nfright, for its contraction is certainly not a necessary concomitant of\r\nthis state of mind.\r\n\r\nA man may exhibit extreme terror in the plainest manner by death-like\r\npallor, by drops of perspiration on his skin, and by utter prostration,\r\nwith all the muscles of his body, including the platysma, completely\r\nrelaxed. Although Dr. Browne has often seen this muscle quivering and\r\ncontracting in the insane, he has not been able to connect its action\r\nwith any emotional condition in them, though he carefully attended to\r\npatients suffering from great fear. Mr. Nicol, on the other hand, has\r\nobserved three cases in which this muscle appeared to be more or less\r\npermanently contracted under the influence of melancholia, associated\r\nwith much dread; but in one of these cases, various other muscles about\r\nthe neck and head were subject to spasmodic contractions.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Ogle observed for me in one of the London hospitals about twenty\r\npatients, just before they were put under the influence of chloroform\r\nfor operations. They exhibited some trepidation, but no great terror.\r\nIn only four of the cases was the platysma visibly contracted; and it\r\ndid not begin to contract until the patients began to cry. The muscle\r\nseemed to contract at the moment of each deep-drawn inspiration; so\r\nthat it is very doubtful whether the contraction depended at all on the\r\nemotion of fear. In a fifth case, the patient, who was not\r\nchloroformed, was much terrified; and his platysma was more forcibly\r\nand persistently contracted than in the other cases. But even here\r\nthere is room for doubt, for the muscle which appeared to be unusually\r\ndeveloped, was seen by Dr. Ogle to contract as the man moved his head\r\nfrom the pillow, after the operation was over.\r\n\r\nAs I felt much perplexed why, in any case, a superficial muscle on the\r\nneck should be especially affected by fear, I applied to my many\r\nobliging correspondents for information about the contraction of this\r\nmuscle under other circumstances. It would be superfluous to give all\r\nthe answers which I have received. They show that this muscle acts,\r\noften in a variable manner and degree, under many different conditions.\r\nIt is violently contracted in hydrophobia, and in a somewhat less\r\ndegree in lockjaw; sometimes in a marked manner during the\r\ninsensibility from chloroform. Dr. W. Ogle observed two male patients,\r\nsuffering from such difficulty in breathing, that the trachea had to be\r\nopened, and in both the platysma was strongly contracted. One of these\r\nmen overheard the conversation of the surgeons surrounding him, and\r\nwhen he was able to speak, declared that he had not been frightened. In\r\nsome other cases of extreme difficulty of respiration, though not\r\nrequiring tracheotomy, observed by Drs. Ogle and Langstaff, the\r\nplatysma was not contracted.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Wood, who has studied with such care the muscles of the human\r\nbody, as shown by his various publications, has often seen the platysma\r\ncontracted in vomiting, nausea, and disgust; also in children and\r\nadults under the influence of rage,—for instance, in Irishwomen,\r\nquarrelling and brawling together with angry gesticulations. This may\r\npossibly have been due to their high and angry tones; for I know a\r\nlady, an excellent musician, who, in singing certain high notes, always\r\ncontracts her platysma. So does a young man, as I have observed, in\r\nsounding certain notes on the flute. Mr. J. Wood informs me that he has\r\nfound the platysma best developed in persons with thick necks and broad\r\nshoulders; and that in families inheriting these peculiarities, its\r\ndevelopment is usually associated with much voluntary power over the\r\nhomologous occipito-frontalis muscle, by which the scalp can be moved.\r\n\r\nNone of the foregoing cases appear to throw any light on the\r\ncontraction of the platysma from fear; but it is different, I think,\r\nwith the following cases. The gentleman before referred to, who can\r\nvoluntarily act on this muscle only on one side of his neck, is\r\npositive that it contracts on both sides whenever he is startled.\r\nEvidence has already been given showing that this muscle sometimes\r\ncontracts, perhaps for the sake of opening the mouth widely, when the\r\nbreathing is rendered difficult by disease, and during the deep\r\ninspirations of crying-fits before an operation. Now, whenever a person\r\nstarts at any sudden sight or sound, he instantaneously draws a deep\r\nbreath; and thus the contraction of the platysma may possibly have\r\nbecome associated with the sense of fear. But there is, I believe, a\r\nmore efficient relation. The first sensation of fear, or the\r\nimagination of something dreadful, commonly excites a shudder. I have\r\ncaught myself giving a little involuntary shudder at a painful thought,\r\nand I distinctly perceived that my platysma contracted; so it does if I\r\nsimulate a shudder. I have asked others to act in this manner; and in\r\nsome the muscle contracted, but not in others. One of my sons, whilst\r\ngetting out of bed, shuddered from the cold, and, as he happened to\r\nhave his hand on his neck, he plainly felt that this muscle strongly\r\ncontracted. He then voluntarily shuddered, as he had done on former\r\noccasions, but the platysma was not then affected. Mr. J. Wood has also\r\nseveral times observed this muscle contracting in patients, when\r\nstripped for examination, and who were not frightened, but shivered\r\nslightly from the cold. Unfortunately I have not been able to ascertain\r\nwhether, when the whole body shakes, as in the cold stage of an ague\r\nfit, the platysma contracts. But as it certainly often contracts during\r\na shudder; and as a shudder or shiver often accompanies the first\r\nsensation of fear, we have, I think, a clue to its action in this\r\nlatter case.[1223] Its contraction, however, is not an invariable\r\nconcomitant of fear; for it probably never acts under the influence of\r\nextreme, prostrating terror.\r\n\r\n_Dilatation of the Pupils_.—Gratiolet repeatedly insists[1224] that the\r\npupils are enormously dilated whenever terror is felt. I have no reason\r\nto doubt the accuracy of this statement, but have failed to obtain\r\nconfirmatory evidence, excepting in the one instance before given of an\r\ninsane woman suffering from great fear. When writers of fiction speak\r\nof the eyes being widely dilated, I presume that they refer to the\r\neyelids. Munro’s statement, that with parrots the iris is affected by\r\nthe passions, independently of the amount of light, seems to bear on\r\nthis question; but Professor Donders informs me, that he has often seen\r\nmovements in the pupils of these birds which he thinks may be related\r\nto their power of accommodation to distance, in nearly the same manner\r\nas our own pupils contract when our eyes converge for near vision.\r\nGratiolet remarks that the dilated pupils appear as if they were gazing\r\ninto profound darkness. No doubt the fears of man have often been\r\nexcited in the dark; but hardly so often or so exclusively, as to\r\naccount for a fixed and associated habit having thus arisen. It seems\r\nmore probable, assuming that Gratiolet’s statement is correct, that the\r\nbrain is directly affected by the powerful emotion of fear and reacts\r\non the pupils; but Professor Donders informs me that this is an\r\nextremely complicated subject. I may add, as possibly throwing light on\r\nthe subject, that Dr. Fyffe, of Netley Hospital, has observed in two\r\npatients that the pupils were distinctly dilated during the cold stage\r\nof an ague fit. Professor Donders has also often seen dilatation of the\r\npupils in incipient faintness.[1225]\r\n\r\n_Horror_.—The state of mind expressed by this term implies terror, and\r\nis in some, cases almost synonymous with it. Many a man must have felt,\r\nbefore the blessed discovery of chloroform, great horror at the thought\r\nof an impending surgical operation. He who dreads, as well as hates a\r\nman, will feel, as Milton uses the word, a horror of him. We feel\r\nhorror if we see any one, for instance a child, exposed to some instant\r\nand crushing danger. Almost every one would experience the same feeling\r\nin the highest degree in witnessing a man being tortured or going to be\r\ntortured. In these cases there is no danger to ourselves; but from the\r\npower of the imagination and of sympathy we put ourselves in the\r\nposition of the sufferer, and feel something akin to fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorror and Agony. Fig. 21\r\n\r\nSir C. Bell remarks,[1226] that “horror is full of energy; the body is\r\nin the utmost tension, not unnerved by fear.” It is, therefore,\r\nprobable that horror would generally be accompanied by the strong\r\ncontraction of the brows; but as fear is one of the elements, the eyes\r\nand mouth would be opened, and the eyebrows would be raised, as far as\r\nthe antagonistic action of the corrugators permitted this movement.\r\nDuchenne has given a photograph[1227] (fig. 21) of the same old man as\r\nbefore, with his eyes somewhat staring, the eyebrows partially raised,\r\nand at the same time strongly contracted, the mouth opened, and the\r\nplatysma in action, all effected by the means of galvanism. He\r\nconsiders that the expression thus produced shows extreme terror with\r\nhorrible pain or torture. A tortured man, as long as his sufferings\r\nallowed him to feel any dread for the future, would probably exhibit\r\nhorror in an extreme degree. I have shown the original of this\r\nphotograph to twenty-three persons of both sexes and various ages; and\r\nthirteen immediately answered horror, great pain, torture, or agony;\r\nthree answered extreme fright; so that sixteen answered nearly in\r\naccordance with Duchenne’s belief. Six, however, said anger, guided no\r\ndoubt, by the strongly contracted brows, and overlooking the peculiarly\r\nopened mouth. One said disgust. On the whole, the evidence indicates\r\nthat we have here a fairly good representation of horror and agony. The\r\nphotograph before referred to (Pl. VII. fig. 2) likewise exhibits\r\nhorror; but in this the oblique eyebrows indicate great mental distress\r\nin place of energy.\r\n\r\nHorror is generally accompanied by various gestures, which differ in\r\ndifferent individuals. Judging from pictures, the whole body is often\r\nturned away or shrinks; or the arms are violently protruded as if to\r\npush away some dreadful object. The most frequent gesture, as far as\r\ncan be inferred from the action of persons who endeavour to express a\r\nvividly-imagined scene of horror, is the raising of both shoulders,\r\nwith the bent arms pressed closely against the sides or chest. These\r\nmovements are nearly the same with those commonly made when we feel\r\nvery cold; and they are generally accompanied by a shudder, as well as\r\nby a deep expiration or inspiration, according as the chest happens at\r\nthe time to be expanded or contracted. The sounds thus made are\r\nexpressed by words like _uh_ or _ugh_.[1228] It is not, however,\r\nobvious why, when we feel cold or express a sense of horror, we press\r\nour bent arms against our bodies, raise our shoulders, and shudder.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_.—I have now endeavoured to describe the diversified\r\nexpressions of fear, in its gradations from mere attention to a start\r\nof surprise, into extreme terror and horror. Some of the signs may be\r\naccounted for through the principles of habit, association, and\r\ninheritance,—such as the wide opening of the mouth and eyes, with\r\nupraised eyebrows, so as to see as quickly as possible all around us,\r\nand to hear distinctly whatever sound may reach our ears. For we have\r\nthus habitually prepared ourselves to discover and encounter any\r\ndanger. Some of the other signs of fear may likewise be accounted for,\r\nat least in part, through these same principles. Men, during numberless\r\ngenerations, have endeavoured to escape from their enemies or danger by\r\nheadlong flight, or by violently struggling with them; and such great\r\nexertions will have caused the heart to beat rapidly, the breathing to\r\nbe hurried, the chest to heave, and the nostrils to be dilated. As\r\nthese exertions have often been prolonged to the last extremity, the\r\nfinal result will have been utter prostration, pallor, perspiration,\r\ntrembling of all the muscles, or their complete relaxation. And now,\r\nwhenever the emotion of fear is strongly felt, though it may not lead\r\nto any exertion, the same results tend to reappear, through the force\r\nof inheritance and association.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is probable that many or most of the above symptoms of\r\nterror, such as the beating of the heart, the trembling of the muscles,\r\ncold perspiration, &c., are in large part directly due to the disturbed\r\nor interrupted transmission of nerve-force from the cerebro-spinal\r\nsystem to various parts of the body, owing to the mind being so\r\npowerfully affected. We may confidently look to this cause,\r\nindependently of habit and association, in such cases as the modified\r\nsecretions of the intestinal canal, and the failure of certain glands\r\nto act. With respect to the involuntary bristling of the hair, we have\r\ngood reason to believe that in the case of animals this action, however\r\nit may have originated, serves, together with certain voluntary\r\nmovements, to make them appear terrible to their enemies; and as the\r\nsame involuntary and voluntary actions are performed by animals nearly\r\nrelated to man, we are led to believe that man has retained through\r\ninheritance a relic of them, now become useless. It is certainly a\r\nremarkable fact, that the minute unstriped muscles, by which the hairs\r\nthinly scattered over man’s almost naked body are erected, should have\r\nbeen preserved to the present day; and that they should still contract\r\nunder the same emotions, namely, terror and rage, which cause the hairs\r\nto stand on end in the lower members of the Order to which man belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. SELF-ATTENTION—SHAME—SHYNESS—MODESTY: BLUSHING.\r\n\r\nNature of a blush—Inheritance—The parts of the body most\r\naffected—Blushing in the various races of man—Accompanying\r\ngestures—Confusion of mind—Causes of blushing—Self-attention, the\r\nfundamental element—Shyness—Shame, from broken moral laws and\r\nconventional rules—Modesty—Theory of blushing—Recapitulation.\r\n\r\nBlushing is the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions.\r\nMonkeys redden from passion, but it would require an overwhelming\r\namount of evidence to make us believe that any animal could blush. The\r\nreddening of the face from a blush is due to the relaxation of the\r\nmuscular coats of the small arteries, by which the capillaries become\r\nfilled with blood; and this depends on the proper vaso-motor centre\r\nbeing affected. No doubt if there be at the same time much mental\r\nagitation, the general circulation will be affected; but it is not due\r\nto the action of the heart that the network of minute vessels covering\r\nthe face becomes under a sense of shame gorged with blood. We can cause\r\nlaughing by tickling the skin, weeping or frowning by a blow, trembling\r\nfrom the fear of pain, and so forth; but we cannot cause a blush, as\r\nDr. Burgess remarks,[1301] by any physical means,—that is by any action\r\non the body. It is the mind which must be affected. Blushing is not\r\nonly involuntary; but the wish to restrain it, by leading to\r\nself-attention actually increases the tendency.\r\n\r\nThe young blush much more freely than the old, but not during\r\ninfancy,[1302] which is remarkable, as we know that infants at a very\r\nearly age redden from passion. I have received authentic accounts of\r\ntwo little girls blushing at the ages of between two and three years;\r\nand of another sensitive child, a year older, blushing, when reproved\r\nfor a fault. Many children, at a somewhat more advanced age blush in a\r\nstrongly marked manner. It appears that the mental powers of infants\r\nare not as yet sufficiently developed to allow of their blushing.\r\nHence, also, it is that idiots rarely blush. Dr. Crichton Browne\r\nobserved for me those under his care, but never saw a genuine blush,\r\nthough he has seen their faces flush, apparently from joy, when food\r\nwas placed before them, and from anger. Nevertheless some, if not\r\nutterly degraded, are capable of blushing. A microcephalous idiot, for\r\ninstance, thirteen years old, whose eyes brightened a little when he\r\nwas pleased or amused, has been described by Dr. Behn,[1303] as\r\nblushing and turning to one side, when undressed for medical\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nWomen blush much more than men. It is rare to see an old man, but not\r\nnearly so rare to see an old woman blushing. The blind do not escape.\r\nLaura Bridgman, born in this condition, as well as completely deaf,\r\nblushes.[1304] The Rev. R. H. Blair, Principal of the Worcester\r\nCollege, informs me that three children born blind, out of seven or\r\neight then in the Asylum, are great blushers. The blind are not at\r\nfirst conscious that they are observed, and it is a most important part\r\nof their education, as Mr. Blair informs me, to impress this knowledge\r\non their minds; and the impression thus gained would greatly strengthen\r\nthe tendency to blush, by increasing the habit of self-attention.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to blush is inherited. Dr. Burgess gives the case[1305] of\r\na family consisting of a father, mother, and ten children, all of whom,\r\nwithout exception, were prone to blush to a most painful degree. The\r\nchildren were grown up; “and some of them were sent to travel in order\r\nto wear away this diseased sensibility, but nothing was of the\r\nslightest avail.” Even peculiarities in blushing seem to be inherited.\r\nSir James Paget, whilst examining the spine of a girl, was struck at\r\nher singular manner of blushing; a big splash of red appeared first on\r\none cheek, and then other splashes, variously scattered over the face\r\nand neck. He subsequently asked the mother whether her daughter always\r\nblushed in this peculiar manner; and was answered, “Yes, she takes\r\nafter me.” Sir J. Paget then perceived that by asking this question he\r\nhad caused the mother to blush; and she exhibited the same peculiarity\r\nas her daughter.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the face, ears and neck are the sole parts which redden;\r\nbut many persons, whilst blushing intensely, feel that their whole\r\nbodies grow hot and tingle; and this shows that the entire surface must\r\nbe in some manner affected. Blushes are said sometimes to commence on\r\nthe forehead, but more commonly on the cheeks, afterwards spreading to\r\nthe ears and neck.[1306] In two Albinos examined by Dr. Burgess, the\r\nblushes commenced by a small circumscribed spot on the cheeks, over the\r\nparotidean plexus of nerves, and then increased into a circle; between\r\nthis blushing circle and the blush on the neck there was an evident\r\nline of demarcation; although both arose simultaneously. The retina,\r\nwhich is naturally red in the Albino, invariably increased at the same\r\ntime in redness.[1307] Every one must have noticed how easily after one\r\nblush fresh blushes chase each other over the face. Blushing is\r\npreceded by a peculiar sensation in the skin. According to Dr. Burgess\r\nthe reddening of the skin is generally succeeded by a slight pallor,\r\nwhich shows that the capillary vessels contract after dilating. In some\r\nrare cases paleness instead of redness is caused under conditions which\r\nwould naturally induce a blush. For instance, a young lady told me that\r\nin a large and crowded party she caught her hair so firmly on the\r\nbutton of a passing servant, that it took some time before she could be\r\nextricated; from her sensations she imagined that she had blushed\r\ncrimson; but was assured by a friend that she had turned extremely\r\npale.\r\n\r\nI was desirous to learn how far down the body blushes extend; and Sir\r\nJ. Paget, who necessarily has frequent opportunities for observation,\r\nhas kindly attended to this point for me during two or three years. He\r\nfinds that with women who blush intensely on the face, ears, and nape\r\nof neck, the blush does not commonly extend any lower down the body. It\r\nis rare to see it as low down as the collar-bones and shoulder-blades;\r\nand he has never himself seen a single instance in which it extended\r\nbelow the upper part of the chest. He has also noticed that blushes\r\nsometimes die away downwards, not gradually and insensibly, but by\r\nirregular ruddy blotches. Dr. Langstaff has likewise observed for me\r\nseveral women whose bodies did not in the least redden while their\r\nfaces were crimsoned with blushes. With the insane, some of whom appear\r\nto be particularly liable to blushing, Dr. J. Crichton Browne has\r\nseveral times seen the blush extend as far down as the collar-bones,\r\nand in two instances to the breasts. He gives me the case of a married\r\nwoman, aged twenty-seven, who suffered from epilepsy. On the morning\r\nafter her arrival in the Asylum, Dr. Browne, together with his\r\nassistants, visited her whilst she was in bed. The moment that he\r\napproached, she blushed deeply over her cheeks and temples; and the\r\nblush spread quickly to her ears. She was much agitated and tremulous.\r\nHe unfastened the collar of her chemise in order to examine the state\r\nof her lungs; and then a brilliant blush rushed over her chest, in an\r\narched line over the upper third of each breast, and extended downwards\r\nbetween the breasts nearly to the ensiform cartilage of the sternum.\r\nThis case is interesting, as the blush did not thus extend downwards\r\nuntil it became intense by her attention being drawn to this part of\r\nher person. As the examination proceeded she became composed, and the\r\nblush disappeared; but on several subsequent occasions the same\r\nphenomena were observed.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts show that, as a general rule, with English women,\r\nblushing does not extend beneath the neck and upper part of the chest.\r\nNevertheless Sir J. Paget informs me that he has lately heard of a\r\ncase, on which he can fully rely, in which a little girl, shocked by\r\nwhat she imagined to be an act of indelicacy, blushed all over her\r\nabdomen and the upper parts of her legs. Moreau also[1308] relates, on\r\nthe authority of a celebrated painter, that the chest, shoulders, arms,\r\nand whole body of a girl, who unwillingly consented to serve as a\r\nmodel, reddened when she was first divested of her clothes.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather curious question why, in most cases the face, ears, and\r\nneck alone redden, inasmuch as the whole surface of the body often\r\ntingles and grows hot. This seems to depend, chiefly, on the face and\r\nadjoining parts of the skin having been habitually exposed to the air,\r\nlight, and alternations of temperature, by which the small arteries not\r\nonly have acquired the habit of readily dilating and contracting, but\r\nappear to have become unusually developed in comparison with other\r\nparts of the surface.[1309] It is probably owing to this same cause, as\r\nM. Moreau and Dr. Burgess have remarked, that the face is so liable to\r\nredden under various circumstances, such as a fever-fit, ordinary heat,\r\nviolent exertion, anger, a slight blow, &c.; and on the other hand that\r\nit is liable to grow pale from cold and fear, and to be discoloured\r\nduring pregnancy. The face is also particularly liable to be affected\r\nby cutaneous complaints, by small-pox, erysipelas, &c. This view is\r\nlikewise supported by the fact that the men of certain races, who\r\nhabitually go nearly naked, often blush over their arms and chests and\r\neven down to their waists. A lady, who is a great blusher, informs Dr.\r\nCrichton Browne, that when she feels ashamed or is agitated, she\r\nblushes over her face, neck, wrists, and hands,—that is, over all the\r\nexposed portions of her skin. Nevertheless it may be doubted whether\r\nthe habitual exposure of the skin of the face and neck, and its\r\nconsequent power of reaction under stimulants of all kinds, is by\r\nitself sufficient to account for the much greater tendency in English\r\nwomen of these parts than of others to blush; for the hands are well\r\nsupplied with nerves and small vessels, and have been as much exposed\r\nto the air as the face or neck, and yet the hands rarely blush. We\r\nshall presently see that the attention of the mind having been directed\r\nmuch more frequently and earnestly to the face than to any other part\r\nof the body, probably affords a sufficient explanation.\r\n\r\n_Blushing in the various races of man_.—The small vessels of the face\r\nbecome filled with blood, from the emotion of shame, in almost all the\r\nraces of man, though in the very dark races no distinct change of\r\ncolour can be perceived. Blushing is evident in all the Aryan nations\r\nof Europe, and to a certain extent with those of India. But Mr. Erskine\r\nhas never noticed that the necks of the Hindoos are decidedly affected.\r\nWith the Lepchas of Sikhim, Mr. Scott has often observed a faint blush\r\non the cheeks, base of the ears, and sides of the neck, accompanied by\r\nsunken eyes and lowered head. This has occurred when he has detected\r\nthem in a falsehood, or has accused them of ingratitude. The pale,\r\nsallow complexions of these men render a blush much more conspicuous\r\nthan in most of the other natives of India. With the latter, shame, or\r\nit may be in part fear, is expressed, according to Mr. Scott, much more\r\nplainly by the head being averted or bent down, with the eyes wavering\r\nor turned askant, than by any change of colour in the skin.\r\n\r\nThe Semitic races blush freely, as might have been expected, from their\r\ngeneral similitude to the Aryans. Thus with the Jews, it is said in the\r\nBook of Jeremiah (chap. vi. 15), “Nay, they were not at all ashamed,\r\nneither could they blush.” Mrs. Asa Gray saw an Arab managing his boat\r\nclumsily on the Nile, and when laughed at by his companions, “he\r\nblushed quite to the back of his neck.” Lady Duff Gordon remarks that a\r\nyoung Arab blushed on coming into her presence.[1310]\r\n\r\nMr. Swinhoe has seen the Chinese blushing, but he thinks it is rare;\r\nyet they have the expression “to redden with shame.” Mr. Geach informs\r\nme that the Chinese settled in Malacca and the native Malays of the\r\ninterior both blush. Some of these people go nearly naked, and he\r\nparticularly attended to the downward extension of the blush. Omitting\r\nthe cases in which the face alone was seen to blush, Mr. Geach observed\r\nthat the face, arms, and breast of a Chinaman, aged 24 years, reddened\r\nfrom shame; and with another Chinese, when asked why he had not done\r\nhis work in better style, the whole body was similarly affected. In two\r\nMalays[1311] he saw the face, neck, breast, and arms blushing; and in a\r\nthird Malay (a Bugis) the blush extended down to the waist.\r\n\r\nThe Polynesians blush freely. The Rev. Mr. Stack has seen hundreds of\r\ninstances with the New Zealanders. The following case is worth giving,\r\nas it relates to an old man who was unusually dark-coloured and partly\r\ntattooed. After having let his land to an Englishman for a small yearly\r\nrental, a strong passion seized him to buy a gig, which had lately\r\nbecome the fashion with the Maoris. He consequently wished to draw all\r\nthe rent for four years from his tenant, and consulted Mr. Stack\r\nwhether he could do so. The man was old, clumsy, poor, and ragged, and\r\nthe idea of his driving himself about in his carriage for display\r\namused Mr. Stack so much that he could not help bursting out into a\r\nlaugh; and then “the old man blushed up to the roots of his hair.”\r\nForster says that “you may easily distinguish a spreading blush” on the\r\ncheeks of the fairest women in Tahiti.[1312] The natives also of\r\nseveral of the other archipelagoes in the Pacific have been seen to\r\nblush.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington Matthews has often seen a blush on the faces of the\r\nyoung squaws belonging to various wild Indian tribes of North America.\r\nAt the opposite extremity of the continent in Tierra del Fuego, the\r\nnatives, according to Mr. Bridges, “blush much, but chiefly in regard\r\nto women; but they certainly blush also at their own personal\r\nappearance.” This latter statement agrees with what I remember of the\r\nFuegian, Jemmy Button, who blushed when he was quizzed about the care\r\nwhich he took in polishing his shoes, and in otherwise adorning\r\nhimself. With respect to the Aymara Indians on the lofty plateaus of\r\nBolivia, Mr. Forbes says,[1313] that from the colour of their skins it\r\nis impossible that their blushes should be as clearly visible as in the\r\nwhite races; still under such circumstances as would raise a blush in\r\nus, “there can always be seen the same expression of modesty or\r\nconfusion; and even in the dark, a rise of temperature of the skin of\r\nthe face can be felt, exactly as occurs in the European.” With the\r\nIndians who inhabit the hot, equable, and damp parts of South America,\r\nthe skin apparently does not answer to mental excitement so readily as\r\nwith the natives of the northern and southern parts of the continent,\r\nwho have long been exposed to great vicissitudes of climate; for\r\nHumboldt quotes without a protest the sneer of the Spaniard, “How can\r\nthose be trusted, who know not how to blush?”[1314] Von Spix and\r\nMartius, in speaking of the aborigines of Brazil, assert that they\r\ncannot properly be said to blush; “it was only after long intercourse\r\nwith the whites, and after receiving some education, that we perceived\r\nin the Indians a change of colour expressive of the emotions of their\r\nminds.”[1315] It is, however, incredible that the power of blushing\r\ncould have thus originated; but the habit of self-attention, consequent\r\non their education and new course of life, would have much increased\r\nany innate tendency to blush.\r\n\r\nSeveral trustworthy observers have assured me that they have seen on\r\nthe faces of negroes an appearance resembling a blush, under\r\ncircumstances which would have excited one in us, though their skins\r\nwere of an ebony-black tint. Some describe it as blushing brown, but\r\nmost say that the blackness becomes more intense. An increased supply\r\nof blood in the skin seems in some manner to increase its blackness;\r\nthus certain exanthematous diseases cause the affected places in the\r\nnegro to appear blacker, instead of, as with us, redder.[1316] The\r\nskin, perhaps, from being rendered more tense by the filling of the\r\ncapillaries, would reflect a somewhat different tint to what it did\r\nbefore. That the capillaries of the face in the negro become filled\r\nwith blood, under the emotion of shame, we may feel confident; because\r\na perfectly characterized albino negress, described by Buffon,[1317]\r\nshowed a faint tinge of crimson on her cheeks when she exhibited\r\nherself naked. Cicatrices of the skin remain for a long time white in\r\nthe negro, and Dr. Burgess, who had frequent opportunities of observing\r\na scar of this kind on the face of a negress, distinctly saw that it\r\n“invariably became red whenever she was abruptly spoken to, or charged\r\nwith any trivial offence.”[1318] The blush could be seen proceeding\r\nfrom the circumference of the scar towards the middle, but it did not\r\nreach the centre. Mulattoes are often great blushers, blush succeeding\r\nblush over their faces. From these facts there can be no doubt that\r\nnegroes blush, although no redness is visible on the skin.\r\n\r\nI am assured by Gaika and by Mrs. Barber that the Kafirs of South\r\nAfrica never blush; but this may only mean that no change of colour is\r\ndistinguishable. Gaika adds that under the circumstances which would\r\nmake a European blush, his countrymen “look ashamed to keep their heads\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by four of my informants that the Australians, who are\r\nalmost as black as negroes, never blush. A fifth answers doubtfully,\r\nremarking that only a very strong blush could be seen, on account of\r\nthe dirty state of their skins. Three observers state that they do\r\nblush;[1319] Mr. S. Wilson adding that this is noticeable only under a\r\nstrong emotion, and when the skin is not too dark from long exposure\r\nand want of cleanliness. Mr. Lang answers, “I have noticed that shame\r\nalmost always excites a blush, which frequently extends as low as the\r\nneck.” Shame is also shown, as he adds, “by the eyes being turned from\r\nside to side.” As Mr. Lang was a teacher in a native school, it is\r\nprobable that he chiefly observed children; and we know that they blush\r\nmore than adults. Mr. G. Taplin has seen half-castes blushing, and he\r\nsays that the aborigines have a word expressive of shame. Mr.\r\nHagenauer, who is one of those who has never observed the Australians\r\nto blush, says that he has “seen them looking down to the ground on\r\naccount of shame;” and the missionary, Mr. Bulmer, remarks that though\r\n“I have not been able to detect anything like shame in the adult\r\naborigines, I have noticed that the eyes of the children, when ashamed,\r\npresent a restless, watery appearance, as if they did not know where to\r\nlook.”\r\n\r\nThe facts now given are sufficient to show that blushing, whether or\r\nnot there is any change of colour, is common to most, probably to all,\r\nof the races of man.\r\n\r\n_Movements and gestures which accompany Blushing_.—Under a keen sense\r\nof shame there is a strong desire for concealment.[1320] We turn away\r\nthe whole body, more especially the face, which we endeavour in some\r\nmanner to hide. An ashamed person can hardly endure to meet the gaze of\r\nthose present, so that he almost invariably casts down his eyes or\r\nlooks askant. As there generally exists at the same time a strong wish\r\nto avoid the appearance of shame, a vain attempt is made to look direct\r\nat the person who causes this feeling; and the antagonism between these\r\nopposite tendencies leads to various restless movements in the eyes. I\r\nhave noticed two ladies who, whilst blushing, to which they are very\r\nliable, have thus acquired, as it appears, the oddest trick of\r\nincessantly blinking their eyelids with extraordinary rapidity. An\r\nintense blush is sometimes accompanied by a slight effusion of\r\ntears;[1321] and this, I presume, is due to the lacrymal glands\r\npartaking of the increased supply of blood, which we know rushes into\r\nthe capillaries of the adjoining parts, including the retina.\r\n\r\nMany writers, ancient and modern, have noticed the foregoing movements;\r\nand it has already been shown that the aborigines in various parts of\r\nthe world often exhibit their shame by looking downwards or askant, or\r\nby restless movements of their eyes. Ezra cries out (ch. ix. 6), “O, my\r\nGod! I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my head to thee, my God.” In\r\nIsaiah (ch. I. 6) we meet with the words, “I hid not my face from\r\nshame.” Seneca remarks (Epist. xi. 5) “that the Roman players hang down\r\ntheir heads, fix their eyes on the ground and keep them lowered, but\r\nare unable to blush in acting shame.” According to Macrobius, who lived\r\nin the filth century (‘Saturnalia,’ B. vii. C. 11), “Natural\r\nphilosophers assert that nature being moved by shame spreads the blood\r\nbefore herself as a veil, as we see any one blushing often puts his\r\nhands before his face.” Shakspeare makes Marcus (‘Titus Andronicus,’\r\nact ii, sc. 5) say to his niece, “Ah! now thou turn’st away thy face\r\nfor shame.” A lady informs me that she found in the Lock Hospital a\r\ngirl whom she had formerly known, and who had become a wretched\r\ncastaway, and the poor creature, when approached, hid her face under\r\nthe bed-clothes, and could not be persuaded to uncover it. We often see\r\nlittle children, when shy or ashamed, turn away, and still standing up,\r\nbury their faces in their mother’s gown; or they throw themselves face\r\ndownwards on her lap.\r\n\r\n_Confusion of mind_.—Most persons, whilst blushing intensely, have\r\ntheir mental powers confused. This is recognized in such common\r\nexpressions as “she was covered with confusion.” Persons in this\r\ncondition lose their presence of mind, and utter singularly\r\ninappropriate remarks. They are often much distressed, stammer, and\r\nmake awkward movements or strange grimaces. In certain cases\r\ninvoluntary twitchings of some of the facial muscles may be observed. I\r\nhave been informed by a young lady, who blushes excessively, that at\r\nsuch times she does not even know what she is saying. When it was\r\nsuggested to her that this might be due to her distress from the\r\nconsciousness that her blushing was noticed, she answered that this\r\ncould not be the case, “as she had sometimes felt quite as stupid when\r\nblushing at a thought in her own room.”\r\n\r\nI will give an instance of the extreme disturbance of mind to which\r\nsome sensitive men are liable. A gentleman, on whom I can rely, assured\r\nme that he had been an eye-witness of the following scene:—A small\r\ndinner-party was given in honour of an extremely shy man, who, when he\r\nrose to return thanks, rehearsed the speech, which he had evidently\r\nlearnt by heart, in absolute silence, and did not utter a single word;\r\nbut he acted as if he were speaking with much emphasis. His friends,\r\nperceiving how the case stood, loudly applauded the imaginary bursts of\r\neloquence, whenever his gestures indicated a pause, and the man never\r\ndiscovered that he had remained the whole time completely silent. On\r\nthe contrary, he afterwards remarked to my friend, with much\r\nsatisfaction, that he thought he had succeeded uncommonly well.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is much ashamed or very shy, and blushes intensely, his\r\nheart beats rapidly and his breathing is disturbed. This can hardly\r\nfail to affect the circulation of the blood within the brain, and\r\nperhaps the mental powers. It seems however doubtful, judging from the\r\nstill more powerful influence of anger and fear on the circulation,\r\nwhether we can thus satisfactorily account for the confused state of\r\nmind in persons whilst blushing intensely.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation apparently lies in the intimate sympathy which\r\nexists between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and\r\nface, and that of the brain. On applying to Dr. J. Crichton Browne for\r\ninformation, he has given me various facts bearing on this subject.\r\nWhen the sympathetic nerve is divided on one side of the head, the\r\ncapillaries on this side are relaxed and become filled with blood,\r\ncausing the skin to redden and to grow hot, and at the same time the\r\ntemperature within the cranium on the same side rises. Inflammation of\r\nthe membranes of the brain leads to the engorgement of the face, ears,\r\nand eyes with blood. The first stage of an epileptic fit appears to be\r\nthe contraction of the vessels of the brain, and the first outward\r\nmanifestation is, an extreme pallor of countenance. Erysipelas of the\r\nhead commonly induces delirium. Even the relief given to a severe\r\nheadache by burning the skin with strong lotion, depends, I presume, on\r\nthe same principle.\r\n\r\nDr. Browne has often administered to his patients the vapour of the\r\nnitrite of amyl,[1322] which has the singular property of causing vivid\r\nredness of the face in from thirty to sixty seconds. This flushing\r\nresembles blushing in almost every detail: it begins at several\r\ndistinct points on the face, and spreads till it involves the whole\r\nsurface of the head, neck, and front of the chest; but has been\r\nobserved to extend only in one case to the abdomen. The arteries in the\r\nretina become enlarged; the eyes glisten, and in one instance there was\r\na slight effusion of tears. The patients are at first pleasantly\r\nstimulated, but, as the flushing increases, they become confused and\r\nbewildered. One woman to whom the vapour had often been administered\r\nasserted that, as soon as she grew hot, she grew MUDDLED. With persons\r\njust commencing to blush it appears, judging from their bright eyes and\r\nlively behaviour, that their mental powers are somewhat stimulated. It\r\nis only when the blushing is excessive that the mind grows confused.\r\nTherefore it would seem that the capillaries of the face are affected,\r\nboth during the inhalation of the nitrite of amyl and during blushing,\r\nbefore that part of the brain is affected on which the mental powers\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nConversely when the brain is primarily affected; the circulation of the\r\nskin is so in a secondary manner. Dr. Browne has frequently observed,\r\nas he informs me, scattered red blotches and mottlings on the chests of\r\nepileptic patients. In these cases, when the skin on the thorax or\r\nabdomen is gently rubbed with a pencil or other object, or, in\r\nstrongly-marked cases, is merely touched by the finger, the surface\r\nbecomes suffused in less than half a minute with bright red marks,\r\nwhich spread to some distance on each side of the touched point, and\r\npersist for several minutes. These are the _cerebral maculae_ of\r\nTrousseau; and they indicate, as Dr. Browne remarks, a highly modified\r\ncondition of the cutaneous vascular system. If, then, there exists, as\r\ncannot be doubted, an intimate sympathy between the capillary\r\ncirculation in that part of the brain on which our mental powers\r\ndepend, and in the skin of the face, it is not surprising that the\r\nmoral causes which induce intense blushing should likewise induce,\r\nindependently of their own disturbing influence, much confusion of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n_The Nature of the Mental States which induce Blushing_.—These consist\r\nof shyness, shame, and modesty; the essential element in all being\r\nself-attention. Many reasons can be assigned for believing that\r\noriginally self-attention directed to personal appearance, in relation\r\nto the opinion of others, was the exciting cause; the same effect being\r\nsubsequently produced, through the force of association, by\r\nself-attention in relation to moral conduct. It is not the simple act\r\nof reflecting on our own appearance, but the thinking what others think\r\nof us, which excites a blush. In absolute solitude the most sensitive\r\nperson would be quite indifferent about his appearance. We feel blame\r\nor disapprobation more acutely than approbation; and consequently\r\ndepreciatory remarks or ridicule, whether of our appearance or conduct,\r\ncauses us to blush much more readily than does praise. But undoubtedly\r\npraise and admiration are highly efficient: a pretty girl blushes when\r\na man gazes intently at her, though she may know perfectly well that he\r\nis not depreciating her. Many children, as well as old and sensitive\r\npersons blush, when they are much praised. Hereafter the question will\r\nbe discussed, how it has arisen that the consciousness that others are\r\nattending to our personal appearance should have led to the\r\ncapillaries, especially those of the face, instantly becoming filled\r\nwith blood.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for believing that attention directed to personal\r\nappearance, and not to moral conduct, has been the fundamental element\r\nin the acquirement of the habit of blushing, will now be given. They\r\nare separately light, but combined possess, as it appears to me,\r\nconsiderable weight. It is notorious that nothing makes a shy person\r\nblush so much as any remark, however slight, on his personal\r\nappearance. One cannot notice even the dress of a woman much given to\r\nblushing, without causing her face to crimson. It is sufficient to\r\nstare hard at some persons to make them, as Coleridge remarks,\r\nblush,—“account for that he who can.”[1323]\r\n\r\nWith the two albinos observed by Dr. Burgess,[1324] “the slightest\r\nattempt to examine their peculiarities invariably caused them to blush\r\ndeeply.” Women are much more sensitive about their personal appearance\r\nthan men are, especially elderly women in comparison with elderly men,\r\nand they blush much more freely. The young of both sexes are much more\r\nsensitive on this same head than the old, and they also blush much more\r\nfreely than the old. Children at a very early age do not blush; nor do\r\nthey show those other signs of self-consciousness which generally\r\naccompany blushing; and it is one of their chief charms that they think\r\nnothing about what others think of them. At this early age they will\r\nstare at a stranger with a fixed gaze and un-blinking eyes, as on an\r\ninanimate object, in a manner which we elders cannot imitate.\r\n\r\nIt is plain to every one that young men and women are highly sensitive\r\nto the opinion of each other with reference to their personal\r\nappearance; and they blush incomparably more in the presence of the\r\nopposite sex than in that of their own.[1325] A young man, not very\r\nliable to blush, will blush intensely at any slight ridicule of his\r\nappearance from a girl whose judgment on any important subject he would\r\ndisregard. No happy pair of young lovers, valuing each other’s\r\nadmiration and love more than anything else in the world, probably ever\r\ncourted each other without many a blush. Even the barbarians of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, according to Mr. Bridges, blush “chiefly in regard to women,\r\nbut certainly also at their own personal appearance.”\r\n\r\nOf all parts of the body, the face is most considered and regarded, as\r\nis natural from its being the chief seat of expression and the source\r\nof the voice. It is also the chief seat of beauty and of ugliness, and\r\nthroughout the world is the most ornamented.[1326] The face, therefore,\r\nwill have been subjected during many generations to much closer and\r\nmore earnest self-attention than any other part of the body; and in\r\naccordance with the principle here advanced we can understand why it\r\nshould be the most liable to blush. Although exposure to alternations\r\nof temperature, &c., has probably much increased the power of\r\ndilatation and contraction in the capillaries of the face and adjoining\r\nparts, yet this by itself will hardly account for these parts blushing\r\nmuch more than the rest of the body; for it does not explain the fact\r\nof the hands rarely blushing. With Europeans the whole body tingles\r\nslightly when the face blushes intensely; and with the races of men who\r\nhabitually go nearly naked, the blushes extend over a much larger\r\nsurface than with us. These facts are, to a certain extent,\r\nintelligible, as the self-attention of primeval man, as well as of the\r\nexisting races which still go naked, will not have been so exclusively\r\nconfined to their faces, as is the case with the people who now go\r\nclothed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in all parts of the world persons who feel shame for\r\nsome moral delinquency, are apt to avert, bend down, or hide their\r\nfaces, independently of any thought about their personal appearance.\r\nThe object can hardly be to conceal their blushes, for the face is thus\r\naverted or hidden under circumstances which exclude any desire to\r\nconceal shame, as when guilt is fully confessed and repented of. It is,\r\nhowever, probable that primeval man before he had acquired much moral\r\nsensitiveness would have been highly sensitive about his personal\r\nappearance, at least in reference to the other sex, and he would\r\nconsequently have felt distress at any depreciatory remarks about his\r\nappearance; and this is one form of shame. And as the face is the part\r\nof the body which is most regarded, it is intelligible that any one\r\nashamed of his personal appearance would desire to conceal this part of\r\nhis body. The habit having been thus acquired, would naturally be\r\ncarried on when shame from strictly moral causes was felt; and it is\r\nnot easy otherwise to see why under these circumstances there should be\r\na desire to hide the face more than any other part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe habit, so general with every one who feels ashamed, of turning\r\naway, or lowering his eyes, or restlessly moving them from side to\r\nside, probably follows from each glance directed towards those present,\r\nbringing home the conviction that he is intently regarded; and he\r\nendeavours, by not looking at those present, and especially not at\r\ntheir eyes, momentarily to escape from this painful conviction.\r\n\r\n_Shyness_.—This odd state of mind, often called shamefacedness, or\r\nfalse shame, or _mauvaise honte_, appears to be one of the most\r\nefficient of all the causes of blushing. Shyness is, indeed, chiefly\r\nrecognized by the face reddening, by the eyes being averted or cast\r\ndown, and by awkward, nervous movements of the body. Many a woman\r\nblushes from this cause, a hundred, perhaps a thousand times, to once\r\nthat she blushes from having done anything deserving blame, and of\r\nwhich she is truly ashamed. Shyness seems to depend on sensitiveness to\r\nthe opinion, whether good or bad, of others, more especially with\r\nrespect to external appearance. Strangers neither know nor care\r\nanything about our conduct or character, but they may, and often do,\r\ncriticize our appearance: hence shy persons are particularly apt to be\r\nshy and to blush in the presence of strangers. The consciousness of\r\nanything peculiar, or even new, in the dress, or any slight blemish on\r\nthe person, and more especially, on the face—points which are likely to\r\nattract the attention of strangers—makes the shy intolerably shy. On\r\nthe other hand, in those cases in which conduct and not personal\r\nappearance is concerned, we are much more apt to be shy in the presence\r\nof acquaintances, whose judgment we in some degree value, than in that\r\nof strangers. A physician told me that a young man, a wealthy duke,\r\nwith whom he had travelled as medical attendant, blushed like a girl,\r\nwhen he paid him his fee; yet this young man probably would not have\r\nblushed and been shy, had he been paying a bill to a tradesman. Some\r\npersons, however, are so sensitive, that the mere act of speaking to\r\nalmost any one is sufficient to rouse their self-consciousness, and a\r\nslight blush is the result.\r\n\r\nDisapprobation or ridicule, from our sensitiveness on this head, causes\r\nshyness and blushing much more readily than does approbation; though\r\nthe latter with some persons is highly efficient. The conceited are\r\nrarely shy; for they value themselves much too highly to expect\r\ndepreciation. Why a proud man is often shy, as appears to be the case,\r\nis not so obvious, unless it be that, with all his self-reliance, he\r\nreally thinks much about the opinion of others although in a disdainful\r\nspirit. Persons who are exceedingly shy are rarely shy in the presence\r\nof those with whom they are quite familiar, and of whose good opinion\r\nand sympathy they are perfectly assured;—for instance, a girl in the\r\npresence of her mother. I neglected to inquire in my printed paper\r\nwhether shyness can be detected in the different races of man; but a\r\nHindoo gentleman assured Mr. Erskine that it is recognizable in his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nShyness, as the derivation of the word indicates in several\r\nlanguages,[1327] is closely related to fear; yet it is distinct from\r\nfear in the ordinary sense. A shy man no doubt dreads the notice of\r\nstrangers, but can hardly be said to be afraid of them, he may be as\r\nbold as a hero in battle, and yet have no self-confidence about trifles\r\nin the presence of strangers. Almost every one is extremely nervous\r\nwhen first addressing a public assembly, and most men remain so\r\nthroughout their lives; but this appears to depend on the consciousness\r\nof a great coming exertion, with its associated effects on the system,\r\nrather than on shyness;[1328] although a timid or shy man no doubt\r\nsuffers on such occasions infinitely more than another. With very young\r\nchildren it is difficult to distinguish between fear and shyness; but\r\nthis latter feeling with them has often seemed to me to partake of the\r\ncharacter of the wildness of an untamed animal. Shyness comes on at a\r\nvery early age. In one of my own children, when two years and three\r\nmonths old, I saw a trace of what certainly appeared to be shyness,\r\ndirected towards myself after an absence from home of only a week. This\r\nwas shown not by a blush, but by the eyes being for a few minutes\r\nslightly averted from me. I have noticed on other occasions that\r\nshyness or shamefacedness and real shame are exhibited in the eyes of\r\nyoung children before they have acquired the power of blushing.\r\n\r\nAs shyness apparently depends on self-attention, we can perceive how\r\nright are those who maintain that reprehending children for shyness,\r\ninstead of doing them any good, does much harm, as it calls their\r\nattention still more closely to themselves. It has been well urged that\r\n“nothing hurts young people more than to be watched continually about\r\ntheir feelings, to have their countenances scrutinized, and the degrees\r\nof their sensibility measured by the surveying eye of the unmerciful\r\nspectator. Under the constraint of such examinations they can think of\r\nnothing but that they are looked at, and feel nothing but shame or\r\napprehension.”[1329]\r\n\r\n_Moral causes: guilt_.—With respect to blushing from strictly moral\r\ncauses, we meet with the same fundamental principle as before, namely,\r\nregard for the opinion of others. It is not the conscience which raises\r\na blush, for a man may sincerely regret some slight fault committed in\r\nsolitude, or he may suffer the deepest remorse for an undetected crime,\r\nbut he will not blush. “I blush,” says Dr. Burgess,[1330] “in the\r\npresence of my accusers.” It is not the sense of guilt, but the thought\r\nthat others think or know us to be guilty which crimsons the face. A\r\nman may feel thoroughly ashamed at having told a small falsehood,\r\nwithout blushing; but if he even suspects that he is detected he will\r\ninstantly blush, especially if detected by one whom he reveres.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a man may be convinced that God witnesses all his\r\nactions, and he may feel deeply conscious of some fault and pray for\r\nforgiveness; but this will not, as a lady who is a great blusher\r\nbelieves, ever excite a blush. The explanation of this difference\r\nbetween the knowledge by God and man of our actions lies, I presume, in\r\nman’s disapprobation of immoral conduct being somewhat akin in nature\r\nto his depreciation of our personal appearance, so that through\r\nassociation both lead to similar results; whereas the disapprobation of\r\nGod brings up no such association.\r\n\r\nMany a person has blushed intensely when accused of some crime, though\r\ncompletely innocent of it. Even the thought, as the lady before\r\nreferred to has observed to me, that others think that we have made an\r\nunkind or stupid remark, is amply sufficient to cause a blush, although\r\nwe know all the time that we have been completely misunderstood. An\r\naction may be meritorious or of an indifferent nature, but a sensitive\r\nperson, if he suspects that others take a different view of it, will\r\nblush. For instance, a lady by herself may give money to a beggar\r\nwithout a trace of a blush, but if others are present, and she doubts\r\nwhether they approve, or suspects that they think her influenced by\r\ndisplay, she will blush. So it will be, if she offers to relieve the\r\ndistress of a decayed gentlewoman, more particularly of one whom she\r\nhad previously known under better circumstances, as she cannot then\r\nfeel sure how her conduct will be viewed. But such cases as these blend\r\ninto shyness.\r\n\r\n_Breaches of etiquette_.—The rules of _etiquette_ always refer to\r\nconduct in the presence of, or towards others. They have no necessary\r\nconnection with the moral sense, and are often meaningless.\r\nNevertheless as they depend on the fixed custom of our equals and\r\nsuperiors, whose opinion we highly regard, they are considered almost\r\nas binding as are the laws of honour to a gentleman. Consequently the\r\nbreach of the laws of etiquette, that is, any impoliteness or\r\n_gaucherie_, any impropriety, or an inappropriate remark, though quite\r\naccidental, will cause the most intense blushing of which a man is\r\ncapable. Even the recollection of such an act, after an interval of\r\nmany years, will make the whole body to tingle. So strong, also, is the\r\npower of sympathy that a sensitive person, as a lady has assured me,\r\nwill sometimes blush at a flagrant breach of etiquette by a perfect\r\nstranger, though the act may in no way concern her.\r\n\r\n_Modesty_.—This is another powerful agent in exciting blushes; but the\r\nword modesty includes very different states of the mind. It implies\r\nhumility, and we often judge of this by persons being greatly pleased\r\nand blushing at slight praise, or by being annoyed at praise which\r\nseems to them too high according to their own humble standard of\r\nthemselves. Blushing here has the usual signification of regard for the\r\nopinion of others. But modesty frequently relates to acts of\r\nindelicacy; and indelicacy is an affair of etiquette, as we clearly see\r\nwith the nations that go altogether or nearly naked. He who is modest,\r\nand blushes easily at acts of this nature, does so because they are\r\nbreaches of a firmly and wisely established etiquette. This is indeed\r\nshown by the derivation of the word _modest_ from _modus_, a measure or\r\nstandard of behaviour. A blush due to this form of modesty is,\r\nmoreover, apt to be intense, because it generally relates to the\r\nopposite sex; and we have seen how in all cases our liability to blush\r\nis thus increased. We apply the term ‘modest,’ as it would appear, to\r\nthose who have an humble opinion of themselves, and to those who are\r\nextremely sensitive about an indelicate word or deed, simply because in\r\nboth cases blushes are readily excited, for these two frames of mind\r\nhave nothing else in common. Shyness also, from this same cause, is\r\noften mistaken for modesty in the sense of humility.\r\n\r\nSome persons flush up, as I have observed and have been assured, at any\r\nsudden and disagreeable recollection. The commonest cause seems to be\r\nthe sudden remembrance of not having done something for another person\r\nwhich had been promised. In this case it may be that the thought passes\r\nhalf unconsciously through the mind, “What will he think of me?” and\r\nthen the flush would partake of the nature of a true blush. But whether\r\nsuch flushes are in most cases due to the capillary circulation being\r\naffected, is very doubtful; for we must remember that almost every\r\nstrong emotion, such as anger or great joy, acts on the heart, and\r\ncauses the face to redden.\r\n\r\nThe fact that blushes may be excited in absolute solitude seems opposed\r\nto the view here taken, namely that the habit originally arose from\r\nthinking about what others think of us. Several ladies, who are great\r\nblushers, are unanimous in regard to solitude; and some of them believe\r\nthat they have blushed in the dark. From what Mr. Forbes has stated\r\nwith respect to the Aymaras, and from my own sensations, I have no\r\ndoubt that this latter statement is correct. Shakspeare, therefore,\r\nerred when he made Juliet, who was not even by herself, say to Romeo\r\n(act ii. sc. 2):—\r\n\r\n“Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face;\r\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek,\r\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when a blush is excited in solitude, the cause almost always\r\nrelates to the thoughts of others about us—to acts done in their\r\npresence, or suspected by them; or again when we reflect what others\r\nwould have thought of us had they known of the act. Nevertheless one or\r\ntwo of my informants believe that they have blushed from shame at acts\r\nin no way relating to others. If this be so, we must attribute the\r\nresult to the force of inveterate habit and association, under a state\r\nof mind closely analogous to that which ordinarily excites a blush; nor\r\nneed we feel surprise at this, as even sympathy with another person who\r\ncommits a flagrant breach of etiquette is believed, as we have just\r\nseen, sometimes to cause a blush.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, I conclude that blushing,—whether due to shyness—to\r\nshame for a real crime—to shame from a breach of the laws of\r\netiquette—to modesty from humility—to modesty from an\r\nindelicacy—depends in all cases on the same principle; this principle\r\nbeing a sensitive regard for the opinion, more particularly for the\r\ndepreciation of others, primarily in relation to our personal\r\nappearance, especially of our faces; and secondarily, through the force\r\nof association and habit, in relation to the opinion of others on our\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n_Theory of Blushing_.—We have now to consider, why should the thought\r\nthat others are thinking about us affect our capillary circulation? Sir\r\nC. Bell insists[1331] that blushing “is a provision for expression, as\r\nmay be inferred from the colour extending only to the surface of the\r\nface, neck, and breast, the parts most exposed. It is not acquired; it\r\nis from the beginning.” Dr. Burgess believes that it was designed by\r\nthe Creator in “order that the soul might have sovereign power of\r\ndisplaying in the cheeks the various internal emotions of the moral\r\nfeelings;” so as to serve as a check on ourselves, and as a sign to\r\nothers, that we were violating rules which ought to be held sacred.\r\nGratiolet merely remarks,—“Or, comme il est dans l’ordre de la nature\r\nque l’être social le plus intelligent soit aussi le plus intelligible,\r\ncette faculté de rougeur et de pâleur qui distingue l’homme, est un\r\nsigne naturel de sa haute perfection.”\r\n\r\nThe belief that blushing was SPECIALLY designed by the Creator is\r\nopposed to the general theory of evolution, which is now so largely\r\naccepted; but it forms no part of my duty here to argue on the general\r\nquestion. Those who believe in design, will find it difficult to\r\naccount for shyness being the most frequent and efficient of all the\r\ncauses of blushing, as it makes the blusher to suffer and the beholder\r\nuncomfortable, without being of the least service to either of them.\r\nThey will also find it difficult to account for negroes and other\r\ndark-coloured races blushing, in whom a change of colour in the skin is\r\nscarcely or not at all visible.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a slight blush adds to the beauty of a maiden’s face; and the\r\nCircassian women who are capable of blushing, invariably fetch a higher\r\nprice in the seraolio of the Sultan than less susceptible women.[1332]\r\nBut the firmest believer in the efficacy of sexual selection will\r\nhardly suppose that blushing was acquired as a sexual ornament. This\r\nview would also be opposed to what has just been said about the\r\ndark-coloured races blushing in an invisible manner.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis which appears to me the most probable, though it may at\r\nfirst seem rash, is that attention closely directed to any part of the\r\nbody tends to interfere with the ordinary and tonic contraction of the\r\nsmall arteries of that part. These vessels, in consequence, become at\r\nsuch times more or less relaxed, and are instantly filled with arterial\r\nblood. This tendency will have been much strengthened, if frequent\r\nattention has been paid during many generations to the same part, owing\r\nto nerve-force readily flowing along accustomed channels, and by the\r\npower of inheritance. Whenever we believe that others are depreciating\r\nor even considering our personal appearance, our attention is vividly\r\ndirected to the outer and visible parts of our bodies; and of all such\r\nparts we are most sensitive about our faces, as no doubt has been the\r\ncase during many past generations. Therefore, assuming for the moment\r\nthat the capillary vessels can be acted on by close attention, those of\r\nthe face will have become eminently susceptible. Through the force of\r\nassociation, the same effects will tend to follow whenever we think\r\nthat others are considering or censuring our actions or character.\r\n\r\nAs the basis of this theory rests on mental attention having some power\r\nto influence the capillary circulation, it will be necessary to give a\r\nconsiderable body of details, bearing more or less directly on this\r\nsubject. Several observers,[1333] who from their wide experience and\r\nknowledge are eminently capable of forming a sound judgment, are\r\nconvinced that attention or consciousness (which latter term Sir H.\r\nHolland thinks the more explicit) concentrated on almost any part of\r\nthe body produces some direct physical effect on it. This applies to\r\nthe movements of the involuntary muscles, and of the voluntary muscles\r\nwhen acting involuntarily,—to the secretion of the glands,—to the\r\nactivity of the senses and sensations,—and even to the nutrition of\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the involuntary movements of the heart are affected if\r\nclose attention be paid to them. Gratiolet[1334] gives the case of a\r\nman, who by continually watching and counting his own pulse, at last\r\ncaused one beat out of every six to intermit. On the other hand, my\r\nfather told me of a careful observer, who certainly had heart-disease\r\nand died from it, and who positively stated that his pulse was\r\nhabitually irregular to an extreme degree; yet to his great\r\ndisappointment it invariably became regular as soon as my father\r\nentered the room. Sir H. Holland remarks, that “the effect upon the\r\ncirculation of a part from the consciousness suddenly directed and\r\nfixed upon it, is often obvious and immediate.” Professor Laycock, who\r\nhas particularly attended to phenomena of this nature, insists that\r\n“when the attention is directed to any portion of the body, innervation\r\nand circulation are excited locally, and the functional activity of\r\nthat portion developed.”\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the peristaltic movements of the\r\nintestines are influenced by attention being paid to them at fixed\r\nrecurrent periods; and these movements depend on the contraction of\r\nunstriped and involuntary muscles. The abnormal action of the voluntary\r\nmuscles in epilepsy, chorea, and hysteria is known to be influenced by\r\nthe expectation of an attack, and by the sight of other patients\r\nsimilarly affected. So it is with the involuntary acts of yawning and\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nCertain glands are much influenced by thinking of them, or of the\r\nconditions under which they have been habitually excited. This is\r\nfamiliar to every one in the increased flow of saliva, when the\r\nthought, for instance, of intensely acid fruit is kept before the mind.\r\nIt was shown in our sixth chapter, that an earnest and long-continued\r\ndesire either to repress, or to increase, the action of the lacrymal\r\nglands is effectual. Some curious cases have been recorded in the case\r\nof women, of the power of the mind on the mammary glands; and still\r\nmore remarkable ones in relation to the uterine functions.\r\n\r\nSee Gratiolet on this subject, De la Phys. p. 287. Dr. J. Crichton\r\nBrowne, from his observations on the insane, is convinced that\r\nattention directed for a prolonged period on any part or organ may\r\nultimately influence its capillary circulation and nutrition. He has\r\ngiven me some extraordinary cases; one of these, which cannot here be\r\nrelated in full, refers to a married woman fifty years of age, who\r\nlaboured under the firm and long-continued delusion that she was\r\npregnant. When the expected period arrived, she acted precisely as if\r\nshe had been really delivered of a child, and seemed to suffer extreme\r\npain, so that the perspiration broke out on her forehead. The result\r\nwas that a state of things returned, continuing for three days, which\r\nhad ceased during the six previous years. Mr. Braid gives, in his\r\n‘Magic, Hypnotism,’ &c., 1852, p. 95, and in his other works analogous\r\ncases, as well as other facts showing the great influence of the will\r\non the mammary glands, even on one breast alone.\r\n\r\nWhen we direct our whole attention to any one sense, its acuteness is\r\nincreased;[1340] and the continued habit of close attention, as with\r\nblind people to that of hearing, and with the blind and deaf to that of\r\ntouch, appears to improve the sense in question permanently. There is,\r\nalso, some reason to believe, judging from the capacities of different\r\nraces of man, that the effects are inherited. Turning to ordinary\r\nsensations, it is well known that pain is increased by attending to it;\r\nand Sir B. Brodie goes so far as to believe that pain may be felt in\r\nany part of the body to which attention is closely drawn.[1341] Sir H.\r\nHolland also remarks that we become not only conscious of the existence\r\nof a part subjected to concentrated attention, but we experience in it\r\nvarious odd sensations as of weight, heat, cold, tingling, or\r\nitching.[1342]\r\n\r\nLastly, some physiologists maintain that the mind can influence the\r\nnutrition of parts. Sir J. Paget has given a curious instance of the\r\npower, not indeed of the mind, but of the nervous system, on the hair.\r\nA lady “who is subject to attacks of what is called nervous headache,\r\nalways finds in the morning after such an one, that some patches of her\r\nhair are white, as if powdered with starch. The change is effected in a\r\nnight, and in a few days after, the hairs gradually regain their dark\r\nbrownish colour.”[1343]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that close attention certainly affects various parts and\r\norgans, which are not properly under the control of the will. By what\r\nmeans attention—perhaps the most wonderful of all the wondrous powers\r\nof the mind—is effected, is an extremely obscure subject. According to\r\nMüller,[1344] the process by which the sensory cells of the brain are\r\nrendered, through the will, susceptible of receiving more intense and\r\ndistinct impressions, is closely analogous to that by which the motor\r\ncells are excited to send nerve-force to the voluntary muscles. There\r\nare many points of analogy in the action of the sensory and motor\r\nnerve-cells; for instance, the familiar fact that close attention to\r\nany one sense causes fatigue, like the prolonged exertion of any one\r\nmuscle.[1345] When therefore we voluntarily concentrate our attention\r\non any part of the body, the cells of the brain which receive\r\nimpressions or sensations from that part are, it is probable, in some\r\nunknown manner stimulated into activity. This may account, without any\r\nlocal change in the part to which our attention is earnestly directed,\r\nfor pain or odd sensations being there felt or increased.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the part is furnished with muscles, we cannot feel sure,\r\nas Mr. Michael Foster has remarked to me, that some slight impulse may\r\nnot be unconsciously sent to such muscles; and this would probably\r\ncause an obscure sensation in the part.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of cases, as with the salivary and lacrymal glands,\r\nintestinal canal, &c., the power of attention seems to rest, either\r\nchiefly, or as some physiologists think, exclusively, on the vaso-motor\r\nsystem being affected in such a manner that more blood is allowed to\r\nflow into the capillaries of the part in question. This increased\r\naction of the capillaries may in some cases be combined with the\r\nsimultaneously increased activity of the sensorium.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the mind affects the vasomotor system may be\r\nconceived in the following manner. When we actually taste sour fruit,\r\nan impression is sent through the gustatory nerves to a certain part of\r\nthe sensorium; this transmits nerve-force to the vasomotor centre,\r\nwhich consequently allows the muscular coats of the small arteries that\r\npermeate the salivary glands to relax. Hence more blood flows into\r\nthese glands, and they secrete a copious supply of saliva. Now it does\r\nnot seem an improbable assumption, that, when we reflect intently on a\r\nsensation, the same part of the sensorium, or a closely connected part\r\nof it, is brought into a state of activity, in the same manner as when\r\nwe actually perceive the sensation. If so, the same cells in the brain\r\nwill be excited, though, perhaps, in a less degree, by vividly thinking\r\nabout a sour taste, as by perceiving it; and they will transmit in the\r\none case, as in the other, nerve-force to the vaso-motor centre with\r\nthe same results.\r\n\r\nTo give another, and, in some respects, more appropriate illustration.\r\nIf a man stands before a hot fire, his face reddens. This appears to be\r\ndue, as Mr. Michael Foster informs me, in part to the local action of\r\nthe heat, and in part to a reflex action from the vaso-motor\r\ncentres.[1346] In this latter case, the heat affects the nerves of the\r\nface; these transmit an impression to the sensory cells of the brain,\r\nwhich act on the vaso-motor centre, and this reacts on the small\r\narteries of the face, relaxing them and allowing them to become filled\r\nwith blood. Here, again, it seems not improbable that if we were\r\nrepeatedly to concentrate with great earnestness our attention on the\r\nrecollection of our heated faces, the same part of the sensorium which\r\ngives us the consciousness of actual heat would be in some slight\r\ndegree stimulated, and would in consequence tend to transmit some\r\nnerve-force to the vaso-motor centres, so as to relax the capillaries\r\nof the face. Now as men during endless generations have had their\r\nattention often and earnestly directed to their personal appearance,\r\nand especially to their faces, any incipient tendency in the facial\r\ncapillaries to be thus affected will have become in the course of time\r\ngreatly strengthened through the principles just referred to, namely,\r\nnerve-force passing readily along accustomed channels, and inherited\r\nhabit. Thus, as it appears to me, a plausible explanation is afforded\r\nof the leading phenomena connected with the act of blushing.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation_.—Men and women, and especially the young, have always\r\nvalued, in a high degree, their personal appearance; and have likewise\r\nregarded the appearance of others. The face has been the chief object\r\nof attention, though, when man aboriginally went naked, the whole\r\nsurface of his body would have been attended to. Our self-attention is\r\nexcited almost exclusively by the opinion of others, for no person\r\nliving in absolute solitude would care about his appearance. Every one\r\nfeels blame more acutely than praise. Now, whenever we know, or\r\nsuppose, that others are depreciating our personal appearance, our\r\nattention is strongly drawn towards ourselves, more especially to our\r\nfaces. The probable effect of this will be, as has just been explained,\r\nto excite into activity that part of the sensorium, which receives the\r\nsensory nerves of the face; and this will react through the vaso-motor\r\nsystem on the facial capillaries. By frequent reiteration during\r\nnumberless generations, the process will have become so habitual, in\r\nassociation with the belief that others are thinking of us, that even a\r\nsuspicion of their depreciation suffices to relax the capillaries,\r\nwithout any conscious thought about our faces. With some sensitive\r\npersons it is enough even to notice their dress to produce the same\r\neffect. Through the force, also, of association and inheritance our\r\ncapillaries are relaxed, whenever we know, or imagine, that any one is\r\nblaming, though in silence, our actions, thoughts, or character; and,\r\nagain, when we are highly praised.\r\n\r\nOn this hypothesis we can understand how it is that the face blushes\r\nmuch more than any other part of the body, though the whole surface is\r\nsomewhat affected, more especially with the races which still go nearly\r\nnaked. It is not at all surprising that the dark-coloured races should\r\nblush, though no change of colour is visible in their skins. From the\r\nprinciple of inheritance it is not surprising that persons born blind\r\nshould blush. We can understand why the young are much more affected\r\nthan the old, and women more than men; and why the opposite sexes\r\nespecially excite each other’s blushes. It becomes obvious why personal\r\nremarks should be particularly liable to cause blushing, and why the\r\nmost powerful of all the causes is shyness; for shyness relates to the\r\npresence and opinion of others, and the shy are always more or less\r\nself-conscious. With respect to real shame from moral delinquencies, we\r\ncan perceive why it is not guilt, but the thought that others think us\r\nguilty, which raises a blush. A man reflecting on a crime committed in\r\nsolitude, and stung by his conscience, does not blush; yet he will\r\nblush under the vivid recollection of a detected fault, or of one\r\ncommitted in the presence of others, the degree of blushing being\r\nclosely related to the feeling of regard for those who have detected,\r\nwitnessed, or suspected his fault. Breaches of conventional rules of\r\nconduct, if they are rigidly insisted on by our equals or superiors,\r\noften cause more intense blushes even than a detected crime, and an act\r\nwhich is really criminal, if not blamed by our equals, hardly raises a\r\ntinge of colour on our cheeks. Modesty from humility, or from an\r\nindelicacy, excites a vivid blush, as both relate to the judgment or\r\nfixed customs of others.\r\n\r\nFrom the intimate sympathy which exists between the capillary\r\ncirculation of the surface of the head and of the brain, whenever there\r\nis intense blushing, there will be some, and often great, confusion of\r\nmind. This is frequently accompanied by awkward movements, and\r\nsometimes by the involuntary twitching of certain muscles.\r\n\r\nAs blushing, according to this hypothesis, is an indirect result of\r\nattention, originally directed to our personal appearance, that is to\r\nthe surface of the body, and more especially to the face, we can\r\nunderstand the meaning of the gestures which accompany blushing\r\nthroughout the world. These consist in hiding the face, or turning it\r\ntowards the ground, or to one side. The eyes are generally averted or\r\nare restless, for to look at the man who causes us to feel shame or\r\nshyness, immediately brings home in an intolerable manner the\r\nconsciousness that his gaze is directed on us. Through the principle of\r\nassociated habit, the same movements of the face and eyes are\r\npractised, and can, indeed, hardly be avoided, whenever we know or\r\nbelieve that, others are blaming, or too strongly praising, our moral\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThe three leading principles which have determined the chief movements\r\nof expression—Their inheritance—On the part which the will and\r\nintention have played in the acquirement of various expressions—The\r\ninstinctive recognition of expression—The bearing of our subject on the\r\nspecific unity of the races of man—On the successive acquirement of\r\nvarious expressions by the progenitors of man—The importance of\r\nexpression—Conclusion.\r\n\r\nI have now described, to the best of my ability, the chief expressive\r\nactions in man, and in some few of the lower animals. I have also\r\nattempted to explain the origin or development of these actions through\r\nthe three principles given in the first chapter. The first of these\r\nprinciples is, that movements which are serviceable in gratifying some\r\ndesire, or in relieving some sensation, if often repeated, become so\r\nhabitual that they are performed, whether or not of any service,\r\nwhenever the same desire or sensation is felt, even in a very weak\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nOur second principle is that of antithesis. The habit of voluntarily\r\nperforming opposite movements under opposite impulses has become firmly\r\nestablished in us by the practice of our whole lives. Hence, if certain\r\nactions have been regularly performed, in accordance with our first\r\nprinciple, under a certain frame of mind, there will be a strong and\r\ninvoluntary tendency to the performance of directly opposite actions,\r\nwhether or not these are of any use, under the excitement of an\r\nopposite frame of mind.\r\n\r\nOur third principle is the direct action of the excited nervous system\r\non the body, independently of the will, and independently, in large\r\npart, of habit. Experience shows that nerve-force is generated and set\r\nfree whenever the cerebro-spinal system is excited. The direction which\r\nthis nerve-force follows is necessarily determined by the lines of\r\nconnection between the nerve-cells, with each other and with various\r\nparts of the body. But the direction is likewise much influenced by\r\nhabit; inasmuch as nerve-force passes readily along accustomed\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nThe frantic and senseless actions of an enraged man may be attributed\r\nin part to the undirected flow of nerve-force, and in part to the\r\neffects of habit, for these actions often vaguely represent the act of\r\nstriking. They thus pass into gestures included under our first\r\nprinciple; as when an indignant man unconsciously throws himself into a\r\nfitting attitude for attacking his opponent, though without any\r\nintention of making an actual attack. We see also the influence of\r\nhabit in all the emotions and sensations which are called exciting; for\r\nthey have assumed this character from having habitually led to\r\nenergetic action; and action affects, in an indirect manner, the\r\nrespiratory and circulatory system; and the latter reacts on the brain.\r\nWhenever these emotions or sensations are even slightly felt by us,\r\nthough they may not at the time lead to any exertion, our whole system\r\nis nevertheless disturbed through the force of habit and association.\r\nOther emotions and sensations are called depressing, because they have\r\nnot habitually led to energetic action, excepting just at first, as in\r\nthe case of extreme pain, fear, and grief, and they have ultimately\r\ncaused complete exhaustion; they are consequently expressed chiefly by\r\nnegative signs and by prostration. Again, there are other emotions,\r\nsuch as that of affection, which do not commonly lead to action of any\r\nkind, and consequently are not exhibited by any strongly marked outward\r\nsigns. Affection indeed, in as far as it is a pleasurable sensation,\r\nexcites the ordinary signs of pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many of the effects due to the excitement of the\r\nnervous system seem to be quite independent of the flow of nerve-force\r\nalong the channels which have been rendered habitual by former\r\nexertions of the will. Such effects, which often reveal the state of\r\nmind of the person thus affected, cannot at present be explained; for\r\ninstance, the change of colour in the hair from extreme terror or\r\ngrief,—the cold sweat and the trembling of the muscles from fear,—the\r\nmodified secretions of the intestinal canal,—and the failure of certain\r\nglands to act.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that much remains unintelligible in our present\r\nsubject, so many expressive movements and actions can be explained to a\r\ncertain extent through the above three principles, that we may hope\r\nhereafter to see all explained by these or by closely analogous\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nActions of all kinds, if regularly accompanying any state of the mind,\r\nare at once recognized as expressive. These may consist of movements of\r\nany part of the body, as the wagging of a dog’s tail, the shrugging of\r\na man’s shoulders, the erection of the hair, the exudation of\r\nperspiration, the state of the capillary circulation, laboured\r\nbreathing, and the use of the vocal or other sound-producing\r\ninstruments. Even insects express anger, terror, jealousy, and love by\r\ntheir stridulation. With man the respiratory organs are of especial\r\nimportance in expression, not only in a direct, but in a still higher\r\ndegree in an indirect manner.\r\n\r\nFew points are more interesting in our present subject than the\r\nextraordinarily complex chain of events which lead to certain\r\nexpressive movements. Take, for instance, the oblique eyebrows of a man\r\nsuffering from grief or anxiety. When infants scream loudly from hunger\r\nor pain, the circulation is affected, and the eyes tend to become\r\ngorged with blood: consequently the muscles surrounding the eyes are\r\nstrongly contracted as a protection: this action, in the course of many\r\ngenerations, has become firmly fixed and inherited: but when, with\r\nadvancing years and culture, the habit of screaming is partially\r\nrepressed, the muscles round the eyes still tend to contract, whenever\r\neven slight distress is felt: of these muscles, the pyramidals of the\r\nnose are less under the control of the will than are the others and\r\ntheir contraction can be checked only by that of the central fasciae of\r\nthe frontal muscle: these latter fasciae draw up the inner ends of the\r\neyebrows, and wrinkle the forehead in a peculiar manner, which we\r\ninstantly recognize as the expression of grief or anxiety. Slight\r\nmovements, such as these just described, or the scarcely perceptible\r\ndrawing down of the corners of the mouth, are the last remnants or\r\nrudiments of strongly marked and intelligible movements. They are as\r\nfull of significance to us in regard to expression, as are ordinary\r\nrudiments to the naturalist in the classification and genealogy of\r\norganic beings.\r\n\r\nThat the chief expressive actions, exhibited by man and by the lower\r\nanimals, are now innate or inherited,—that is, have not been learnt by\r\nthe individual,—is admitted by every one. So little has learning or\r\nimitation to do with several of them that they are from the earliest\r\ndays and throughout life quite beyond our control; for instance, the\r\nrelaxation of the arteries of the skin in blushing, and the increased\r\naction of the heart in anger. We may see children, only two or three\r\nyears old, and even those born blind, blushing from shame; and the\r\nnaked scalp of a very young infant reddens from passion. Infants scream\r\nfrom pain directly after birth, and all their features then assume the\r\nsame form as during subsequent years. These facts alone suffice to show\r\nthat many of our most important expressions have not been learnt; but\r\nit is remarkable that some, which are certainly innate, require\r\npractice in the individual, before they are performed in a full and\r\nperfect manner; for instance, weeping and laughing. The inheritance of\r\nmost of our expressive actions explains the fact that those born blind\r\ndisplay them, as I hear from the Rev. R. H. Blair, equally well with\r\nthose gifted with eyesight. We can thus also understand the fact that\r\nthe young and the old of widely different races, both with man and\r\nanimals, express the same state of mind by the same movements.\r\n\r\nWe are so familiar with the fact of young and old animals displaying\r\ntheir feelings in the same manner, that we hardly perceive how\r\nremarkable it is that a young puppy should wag its tail when pleased,\r\ndepress its ears and uncover its canine teeth when pretending to be\r\nsavage, just like an old dog; or that a kitten should arch its little\r\nback and erect its hair when frightened and angry, like an old cat.\r\nWhen, however, we turn to less common gestures in ourselves, which we\r\nare accustomed to look at as artificial or conventional,—such as\r\nshrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence, or the raising the\r\narms with open hands and extended fingers, as a sign of wonder,—we feel\r\nperhaps too much surprise at finding that they are innate. That these\r\nand some other gestures are inherited, we may infer from their being\r\nperformed by very young children, by those born blind, and by the most\r\nwidely distinct races of man. We should also bear in mind that new and\r\nhighly peculiar tricks, in association with certain states of the mind,\r\nare known to have arisen in certain individuals, and to have been\r\nafterwards transmitted to their offspring, in some cases, for more than\r\none generation.\r\n\r\nCertain other gestures, which seem to us so natural that we might\r\neasily imagine that they were innate, apparently have been learnt like\r\nthe words of a language. This seems to be the case with the joining of\r\nthe uplifted hands, and the turning up of the eyes, in prayer. So it is\r\nwith kissing as a mark of affection; but this is innate, in so far as\r\nit depends on the pleasure derived from contact with a beloved person.\r\nThe evidence with respect to the inheritance of nodding and shaking the\r\nhead, as signs of affirmation and negation, is doubtful; for they are\r\nnot universal, yet seem too general to have been independently acquired\r\nby all the individuals of so many races.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider how far the will and consciousness have come into\r\nplay in the development of the various movements of expression. As far\r\nas we can judge, only a few expressive movements, such as those just\r\nreferred to, are learnt by each individual; that is, were consciously\r\nand voluntarily performed during the early years of life for some\r\ndefinite object, or in imitation of others, and then became habitual.\r\nThe far greater number of the movements of expression, and all the more\r\nimportant ones, are, as we have seen, innate or inherited; and such\r\ncannot be said to depend on the will of the individual. Nevertheless,\r\nall those included under our first principle were at first voluntarily\r\nperformed for a definite object,—namely, to escape some danger, to\r\nrelieve some distress, or to gratify some desire. For instance, there\r\ncan hardly be a doubt that the animals which fight with their teeth,\r\nhave acquired the habit of drawing back their ears closely to their\r\nheads, when feeling savage, from their progenitors having voluntarily\r\nacted in this manner in order to protect their ears from being torn by\r\ntheir antagonists; for those animals which do not fight with their\r\nteeth do not thus express a savage state of mind. We may infer as\r\nhighly probable that we ourselves have acquired the habit of\r\ncontracting the muscles round the eyes, whilst crying gently, that is,\r\nwithout the utterance of any loud sound, from our progenitors,\r\nespecially during infancy, having experienced, during the act of\r\nscreaming, an uncomfortable sensation in their eyeballs. Again, some\r\nhighly expressive movements result from the endeavour to cheek or\r\nprevent other expressive movements; thus the obliquity of the eyebrows\r\nand the drawing down of the corners of the mouth follow from the\r\nendeavour to prevent a screaming-fit from coming on, or to cheek it\r\nafter it has come on. Here it is obvious that the consciousness and\r\nwill must at first have come into play; not that we are conscious in\r\nthese or in other such cases what muscles are brought into action, any\r\nmore than when we perform the most ordinary voluntary movements.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the expressive movements due to the principle of\r\nantithesis, it is clear that the will has intervened, though in a\r\nremote and indirect manner. So again with the movements coming under\r\nour third principle; these, in as far as they are influenced by\r\nnerve-force readily passing along habitual channels, have been\r\ndetermined by former and repeated exertions of the will. The effects\r\nindirectly due to this latter agency are often combined in a complex\r\nmanner, through the force of habit and association, with those directly\r\nresulting from the excitement of the cerebro-spinal system. This seems\r\nto be the case with the increased action of the heart under the\r\ninfluence of any strong emotion. When an animal erects its hair,\r\nassumes a threatening attitude, and utters fierce sounds, in order to\r\nterrify an enemy, we see a curious combination of movements which were\r\noriginally voluntary with those that are involuntary. It is, however,\r\npossible that even strictly involuntary actions, such as the erection\r\nof the hair, may have been affected by the mysterious power of the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nSome expressive movements may have arisen spontaneously, in association\r\nwith certain states of the mind, like the tricks lately referred to,\r\nand afterwards been inherited. But I know of no evidence rendering this\r\nview probable.\r\n\r\nThe power of communication between the members of the same tribe by\r\nmeans of language has been of paramount importance in the development\r\nof man; and the force of language is much aided by the expressive\r\nmovements of the face and body. We perceive this at once when we\r\nconverse on an important subject with any person whose face is\r\nconcealed. Nevertheless there are no grounds, as far as I can discover,\r\nfor believing that any muscle has been developed or even modified\r\nexclusively for the sake of expression. The vocal and other\r\nsound-producing organs, by which various expressive noises are\r\nproduced, seem to form a partial exception; but I have elsewhere\r\nattempted to show that these organs were first developed for sexual\r\npurposes, in order that one sex might call or charm the other. Nor can\r\nI discover grounds for believing that any inherited movement, which now\r\nserves as a means of expression, was at first voluntarily and\r\nconsciously performed for this special purpose,—like some of the\r\ngestures and the finger-language used by the deaf and dumb. On the\r\ncontrary, every true or inherited movement of expression seems to have\r\nhad some natural and independent origin. But when once acquired, such\r\nmovements may be voluntarily and consciously employed as a means of\r\ncommunication. Even infants, if carefully attended to, find out at a\r\nvery early age that their screaming brings relief, and they soon\r\nvoluntarily practise it. We may frequently see a person voluntarily\r\nraising his eyebrows to express surprise, or smiling to express\r\npretended satisfaction and acquiescence. A man often wishes to make\r\ncertain gestures conspicuous or demonstrative, and will raise his\r\nextended arms with widely opened fingers above his head, to show\r\nastonishment, or lift his shoulders to his ears, to show that he cannot\r\nor will not do something. The tendency to such movements will be\r\nstrengthened or increased by their being thus voluntarily and\r\nrepeatedly performed; and the effects may be inherited.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps worth consideration whether movements at first used only\r\nby one or a few individuals to express a certain state of mind may not\r\nsometimes have spread to others, and ultimately have become universal,\r\nthrough the power of conscious and unconscious imitation. That there\r\nexists in man a strong tendency to imitation, independently of the\r\nconscious will, is certain. This is exhibited in the most extraordinary\r\nmanner in certain brain diseases, especially at the commencement of\r\ninflammatory softening of the brain, and has been called the “echo\r\nsign.” Patients thus affected imitate, without understanding every\r\nabsurd gesture which is made, and every word which is uttered near\r\nthem, even in a foreign language.[1401] In the case of animals, the\r\njackal and wolf have learnt under confinement to imitate the barking of\r\nthe dog. How the barking of the dog, which serves to express various\r\nemotions and desires, and which is so remarkable from having been\r\nacquired since the animal was domesticated, and from being inherited in\r\ndifferent degrees by different breeds, was first learnt we do not know;\r\nbut may we not suspect that imitation has had something to do with its\r\nacquisition, owing to dogs having long lived in strict association with\r\nso loquacious an animal as man?\r\n\r\nIn the course of the foregoing remarks and throughout this volume, I\r\nhave often felt much difficulty about the proper application of the\r\nterms, will, consciousness, and intention. Actions, which were at first\r\nvoluntary, soon became habitual, and at last hereditary, and may then\r\nbe performed even in opposition to the will. Although they often reveal\r\nthe state of the mind, this result was not at first either intended or\r\nexpected. Even such words as that “certain movements serve as a means\r\nof expression,” are apt to mislead, as they imply that this was their\r\nprimary purpose or object. This, however, seems rarely or never to have\r\nbeen the case; the movements having been at first either of some direct\r\nuse, or the indirect effect of the excited state of the sensorium. An\r\ninfant may scream either intentionally or instinctively to show that it\r\nwants food; but it has no wish or intention to draw its features into\r\nthe peculiar form which so plainly indicates misery; yet some of the\r\nmost characteristic expressions exhibited by man are derived from the\r\nact of screaming, as has been explained.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of our expressive actions are innate or instinctive, as\r\nis admitted by everyone, it is a different question whether we have any\r\ninstinctive power of recognizing them. This has generally been assumed\r\nto be the case; but the assumption has been strongly controverted by M.\r\nLemoine.[1402] Monkeys soon learn to distinguish, not only the tones of\r\nvoice of their masters, but the expression of their faces, as is\r\nasserted by a careful observer.[1403] Dogs well know the difference\r\nbetween caressing and threatening gestures or tones; and they seem to\r\nrecognize a compassionate tone. But as far as I can make out, after\r\nrepeated trials, they do not understand any movement confined to the\r\nfeatures, excepting a smile or laugh; and this they appear, at least in\r\nsome cases, to recognize. This limited amount of knowledge has probably\r\nbeen gained, both by monkeys and dogs, through their associating harsh\r\nor kind treatment with our actions; and the knowledge certainly is not\r\ninstinctive. Children, no doubt, would soon learn the movements of\r\nexpression in their elders in the same manner as animals learn those of\r\nman. Moreover, when a child cries or laughs, he knows in a general\r\nmanner what he is doing and what he feels; so that a very small\r\nexertion of reason would tell him what crying or laughing meant in\r\nothers. But the question is, do our children acquire their knowledge of\r\nexpression solely by experience through the power of association and\r\nreason?\r\n\r\nAs most of the movements of expression must have been gradually\r\nacquired, afterwards becoming instinctive, there seems to be some\r\ndegree of _a priori_ probability that their recognition would likewise\r\nhave become instinctive. There is, at least, no greater difficulty in\r\nbelieving this than in admitting that, when a female quadruped first\r\nbears young, she knows the cry of distress of her offspring, or than in\r\nadmitting that many animals instinctively recognize and fear their\r\nenemies; and of both these statements there can be no reasonable doubt.\r\nIt is however extremely difficult to prove that our children\r\ninstinctively recognize any expression. I attended to this point in my\r\nfirst-born infant, who could not have learnt anything by associating\r\nwith other children, and I was convinced that he understood a smile and\r\nreceived pleasure from seeing one, answering it by another, at much too\r\nearly an age to have learnt anything by experience. When this child was\r\nabout four months old, I made in his presence many odd noises and\r\nstrange grimaces, and tried to look savage; but the noises, if not too\r\nloud, as well as the grimaces, were all taken as good jokes; and I\r\nattributed this at the time to their being preceded or accompanied by\r\nsmiles. When five months old, he seemed to understand a compassionate,\r\nexpression and tone of voice. When a few days over six months old, his\r\nnurse pretended to cry, and I saw that his face instantly assumed a\r\nmelancholy expression, with the corners of the mouth strongly\r\ndepressed; now this child could rarely have seen any other child\r\ncrying, and never a grown-up person crying, and I should doubt whether\r\nat so early an age he could have reasoned on the subject. Therefore it\r\nseems to me that an innate feeling must have told him that the\r\npretended crying of his nurse expressed grief; and this through the\r\ninstinct of sympathy excited grief in him.\r\n\r\nM. Lemoine argues that, if man possessed an innate knowledge of\r\nexpression, authors and artists would not have found it so difficult,\r\nas is notoriously the case, to describe and depict the characteristic\r\nsigns of each particular state of mind. But this does not seem to me a\r\nvalid argument. We may actually behold the expression changing in an\r\nunmistakable manner in a man or animal, and yet be quite unable, as I\r\nknow from experience, to analyse the nature of the change. In the two\r\nphotographs given by Duchenne of the same old man (Plate III. figs. 5\r\nand 6), almost every one recognized that the one represented a true,\r\nand the other a false smile; but I have found it very difficult to\r\ndecide in what the whole amount of difference consists. It has often\r\nstruck me as a curious fact that so many shades of expression are\r\ninstantly recognized without any conscious process of analysis on our\r\npart. No one, I believe, can clearly describe a sullen or sly\r\nexpression; yet many observers are unanimous that these expressions can\r\nbe recognized in the various races of man. Almost everyone to whom I\r\nshowed Duchenne’s photograph of the young man with oblique eyebrows\r\n(Plate II. fig. 2) at once declared that it expressed grief or some\r\nsuch feeling; yet probably not one of these persons, or one out of a\r\nthousand persons, could beforehand have told anything precise about the\r\nobliquity of the eyebrows with their inner ends puckered, or about the\r\nrectangular furrows on the forehead. So it is with many other\r\nexpressions, of which I have had practical experience in the trouble\r\nrequisite in instructing others what points to observe. If, then, great\r\nignorance of details does not prevent our recognizing with certainty\r\nand promptitude various expressions, I do not see how this ignorance\r\ncan be advanced as an argument that our knowledge, though vague and\r\ngeneral, is not innate.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to show in considerable detail that all the chief\r\nexpressions exhibited by man are the same throughout the world. This\r\nfact is interesting, as it affords a new argument in favour of the\r\nseveral races being descended from a single parent-stock, which must\r\nhave been almost completely human in structure, and to a large extent\r\nin mind, before the period at which the races diverged from each other.\r\nNo doubt similar structures, adapted for the same purpose, have often\r\nbeen independently acquired through variation and natural selection by\r\ndistinct species; but this view will not explain close similarity\r\nbetween distinct species in a multitude of unimportant details. Now if\r\nwe bear in mind the numerous points of structure having no relation to\r\nexpression, in which all the races of man closely agree, and then add\r\nto them the numerous points, some of the highest importance and many of\r\nthe most trifling value, on which the movements of expression directly\r\nor indirectly depend, it seems to me improbable in the highest degree\r\nthat so much similarity, or rather identity of structure, could have\r\nbeen acquired by independent means. Yet this must have been the case if\r\nthe races of man are descended from several aboriginally distinct\r\nspecies. It is far more probable that the many points of close\r\nsimilarity in the various races are due to inheritance from a single\r\nparent-form, which had already assumed a human character.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious, though perhaps an idle speculation, how early in the\r\nlong line of our progenitors the various expressive movements, now\r\nexhibited by man, were successively acquired. The following remarks\r\nwill at least serve to recall some of the chief points discussed in\r\nthis volume. We may confidently believe that laughter, as a sign of\r\npleasure or enjoyment, was practised by our progenitors long before\r\nthey deserved to be called human; for very many kinds of monkeys, when\r\npleased, utter a reiterated sound, clearly analogous to our laughter,\r\noften accompanied by vibratory movements of their jaws or lips, with\r\nthe corners of the mouth drawn backwards and upwards, by the wrinkling\r\nof the cheeks, and even by the brightening of the eyes.\r\n\r\nWe may likewise infer that fear was expressed from an extremely remote\r\nperiod, in almost the same manner as it now is by man; namely, by\r\ntrembling, the erection of the hair, cold perspiration, pallor, widely\r\nopened eyes, the relaxation of most of the muscles, and by the whole\r\nbody cowering downwards or held motionless.\r\n\r\nSuffering, if great, will from the first have caused screams or groans\r\nto be uttered, the body to be contorted, and the teeth to be ground\r\ntogether. But our progenitors will not have exhibited those highly\r\nexpressive movements of the features which accompany screaming and\r\ncrying until their circulatory and respiratory organs, and the muscles\r\nsurrounding the eyes, had acquired their present structure. The\r\nshedding of tears appears to have originated through reflex action from\r\nthe spasmodic contraction of the eyelids, together perhaps with the\r\neyeballs becoming gorged with blood during the act of screaming.\r\nTherefore weeping probably came on rather late in the line of our\r\ndescent; and this conclusion agrees with the fact that our nearest\r\nallies, the anthropomorphous apes, do not weep. But we must here\r\nexercise some caution, for as certain monkeys, which are not closely\r\nrelated to man, weep, this habit might have been developed long ago in\r\na sub-branch of the group from which man is derived. Our early\r\nprogenitors, when suffering from grief or anxiety, would not have made\r\ntheir eyebrows oblique, or have drawn down the corners of their mouth,\r\nuntil they had acquired the habit of endeavouring to restrain their\r\nscreams. The expression, therefore, of grief and anxiety is eminently\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nRage will have been expressed at a very early period by threatening or\r\nfrantic gestures, by the reddening of the skin, and by glaring eyes,\r\nbut not by frowning. For the habit of frowning seems to have been\r\nacquired chiefly from the corrugators being the first muscles to\r\ncontract round the eyes, whenever during infancy pain, anger, or\r\ndistress is felt, and there consequently is a near approach to\r\nscreaming; and partly from a frown serving as a shade in difficult and\r\nintent vision. It seems probable that this shading action would not\r\nhave become habitual until man had assumed a completely upright\r\nposition, for monkeys do not frown when exposed to a glaring light. Our\r\nearly progenitors, when enraged, would probably have exposed their\r\nteeth more freely than does man, even when giving full vent to his\r\nrage, as with the insane. We may, also, feel almost certain that they\r\nwould have protruded their lips, when sulky or disappointed, in a\r\ngreater degree than is the case with our own children, or even with the\r\nchildren of existing savage races.\r\n\r\nOur early progenitors, when indignant or moderately angry, would not\r\nhave held their heads erect, opened their chests, squared their\r\nshoulders, and clenched their fists, until they had acquired the\r\nordinary carriage and upright attitude of man, and had learnt to fight\r\nwith their fists or clubs. Until this period had arrived the\r\nantithetical gesture of shrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence\r\nor of patience, would not have been developed. From the same reason\r\nastonishment would not then have been expressed by raising the arms\r\nwith open hands and extended fingers. Nor, judging from the actions of\r\nmonkeys, would astonishment have been exhibited by a widely opened\r\nmouth; but the eyes would have been opened and the eyebrows arched.\r\nDisgust would have been shown at a very early period by movements round\r\nthe mouth, like those of vomiting,—that is, if the view which I have\r\nsuggested respecting the source of the expression is correct, namely,\r\nthat our progenitors had the power, and used it, of voluntarily and\r\nquickly rejecting any food from their stomachs which they disliked. But\r\nthe more refined manner of showing contempt or disdain, by lowering the\r\neyelids, or turning away the eyes and face, as if the despised person\r\nwere not worth looking at, would not probably have been acquired until\r\na much later period.\r\n\r\nOf all expressions, blushing seems to be the most strictly human; yet\r\nit is common to all or nearly all the races of man, whether or not any\r\nchange of colour is visible in their skin. The relaxation of the small\r\narteries of the surface, on which blushing depends, seems to have\r\nprimarily resulted from earnest attention directed to the appearance of\r\nour own persons, especially of our faces, aided by habit, inheritance,\r\nand the ready flow of nerve-force along accustomed channels; and\r\nafterwards to have been extended by the power of association to\r\nself-attention directed to moral conduct. It can hardly be doubted that\r\nmany animals are capable of appreciating beautiful colours and even\r\nforms, as is shown by the pains which the individuals of one sex take\r\nin displaying their beauty before those of the opposite sex. But it\r\ndoes not seem possible that any animal, until its mental powers had\r\nbeen developed to an equal or nearly equal degree with those of man,\r\nwould have closely considered and been sensitive about its own personal\r\nappearance. Therefore we may conclude that blushing originated at a\r\nvery late period in the long line of our descent.\r\n\r\nFrom the various facts just alluded to, and given in the course of this\r\nvolume, it follows that, if the structure of our organs of respiration\r\nand circulation had differed in only a slight degree from the state in\r\nwhich they now exist, most of our expressions would have been\r\nwonderfully different. A very slight change in the course of the\r\narteries and veins which run to the head, would probably have prevented\r\nthe blood from accumulating in our eyeballs during violent expiration;\r\nfor this occurs in extremely few quadrupeds. In this case we should not\r\nhave displayed some of our most characteristic expressions. If man had\r\nbreathed water by the aid of external branchiae (though the idea is\r\nhardly conceivable), instead of air through his mouth and nostrils, his\r\nfeatures would not have expressed his feelings much more efficiently\r\nthan now do his hands or limbs. Rage and disgust, however, would still\r\nhave been shown by movements about the lips and mouth, and the eyes\r\nwould have become brighter or duller according to the state of the\r\ncirculation. If our ears had remained movable, their movements would\r\nhave been highly expressive, as is the case with all the animals which\r\nfight with their teeth; and we may infer that our early progenitors\r\nthus fought, as we still uncover the canine tooth on one side when we\r\nsneer at or defy any one, and we uncover all our teeth when furiously\r\nenraged.\r\n\r\nThe movements of expression in the face and body, whatever their origin\r\nmay have been, are in themselves of much importance for our welfare.\r\nThey serve as the first means of communication between the mother and\r\nher infant; she smiles approval, and thus encourages her child on the\r\nright path, or frowns disapproval. We readily perceive sympathy in\r\nothers by their expression; our sufferings are thus mitigated and our\r\npleasures increased; and mutual good feeling is thus strengthened. The\r\nmovements of expression give vividness and energy to our spoken words.\r\nThey reveal the thoughts and intentions of others more truly than do\r\nwords, which may be falsified. Whatever amount of truth the so-called\r\nscience of physiognomy may contain, appears to depend, as Haller long\r\nago remarked,[1404] on different persons bringing into frequent use\r\ndifferent facial muscles, according to their dispositions; the\r\ndevelopment of these muscles being perhaps thus increased, and the\r\nlines or furrows on the face, due to their habitual contraction, being\r\nthus rendered deeper and more conspicuous. The free expression by\r\noutward signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the\r\nrepression, as far as this is possible, of all outward signs softens\r\nour emotions.[1405] He who gives way to violent gestures will increase\r\nhis rage; he who does not control the signs of fear will experience\r\nfear in a greater degree; and he who remains passive when overwhelmed\r\nwith grief loses his best chance of recovering elasticity of mind.\r\nThese results follow partly from the intimate relation which exists\r\nbetween almost all the emotions and their outward manifestations; and\r\npartly from the direct influence of exertion on the heart, and\r\nconsequently on the brain. Even the simulation of an emotion tends to\r\narouse it in our minds. Shakespeare, who from his wonderful knowledge\r\nof the human mind ought to be an excellent judge, says:—\r\n\r\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\r\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\r\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit,\r\nThat, from her working, all his visage wann’d;\r\nTears in his eyes, distraction in ’s aspect,\r\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\r\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\r\n_Hamlet_, act ii. sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the study of the theory of expression confirms to a\r\ncertain limited extent the conclusion that man is derived from some\r\nlower animal form, and supports the belief of the specific or\r\nsub-specific unity of the several races; but as far as my judgment\r\nserves, such confirmation was hardly needed. We have also seen that\r\nexpression in itself, or the language of the emotions, as it has\r\nsometimes been called, is certainly of importance for the welfare of\r\nmankind. To understand, as far as possible, the source or origin of the\r\nvarious expressions which may be hourly seen on the faces of the men\r\naround us, not to mention our domesticated animals, ought to possess\r\nmuch interest for us. From these several causes, we may conclude that\r\nthe philosophy of our subject has well deserved the attention which it\r\nhas already received from several excellent observers, and that it\r\ndeserves still further attention, especially from any able\r\nphysiologist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ J.

The inheritance of habitual gestures is\r\nso important for us, that I gladly avail myself of Mr. F.

The particulars are\r\nperfectly trustworthy, for I have enquired fully into them, and speak\r\nfrom abundant and independent evidence. A gentleman of considerable\r\nposition was found by his wife to have the curious trick, when he lay\r\nfast asleep on his back in bed, of raising his right arm slowly in\r\nfront of his face, up to his forehead, and then dropping it with a\r\njerk, so that the wrist fell heavily on the bridge of his nose. The\r\ntrick did not occur every night, but occasionally, and was independent\r\nof any ascertained cause. Sometimes it was repeated incessantly for an\r\nhour or more. The gentleman’s nose was prominent, and its bridge often\r\nbecame sore from the blows which it received. At one time an awkward\r\nsore was produced, that was long in healing, on account of the\r\nrecurrence, night after night, of the blows which first caused it. His\r\nwife had to remove the button from the wrist of his night-gown as it\r\nmade severe scratches, and some means were attempted of tying his arm.\r\n\r\n“Many years after his death, his son married a lady who had never heard\r\nof the family incident. She, however, observed precisely the same\r\npeculiarity in her husband; but his nose, from not being particularly\r\nprominent, has never as yet suffered from the blows. The trick does not\r\noccur when he is half-asleep, as, for example, when dozing in his\r\narm-chair, but the moment he is fast asleep it is apt to begin. It is,\r\nas with his father, intermittent; sometimes ceasing for many nights,\r\nand sometimes almost incessant during a part of every night. It is\r\nperformed, as it was by his father, with his right hand.\r\n\r\n“One of his children, a girl, has inherited the same trick. She\r\nperforms it, likewise, with the right hand, but in a slightly modified\r\nform; for, after raising the arm, she does not allow the wrist to drop\r\nupon the bridge of the nose, but the palm of the half-closed hand falls\r\nover and down the nose, striking it rather rapidly.

He has given\r\na figure (Album, fig. 48) in which one half of the face is made, by\r\ngalvanizing the proper muscles, to smile; whilst the other half is\r\nsimilarly made to begin crying. Almost all those (viz. nineteen out of\r\ntwenty-one persons) to whom I showed the smiling half of the face\r\ninstantly recognized the expression; but, with respect to the other\r\nhalf, only six persons out of twenty-one recognized it,—that is, if we\r\naccept such terms as “grief,” “misery,” “annoyance,” as\r\ncorrect;—whereas, fifteen persons were ludicrously mistaken; some of\r\nthem saying the face expressed “fun,” “satisfaction,” “cunning,”\r\n“disgust,” &c.

In both cases we carefully endeavour to avoid\r\ngreat expiratory pressure, the disadvantage of which is well known.”\r\nMr. Bowman informs me that in the excessive photophobia, accompanying\r\nwhat is called scrofulous ophthalmia in children, when the light is so\r\nvery painful that during weeks or months it is constantly excluded by\r\nthe most forcible closure of the lids, he has often been struck on\r\nopening the lids by the paleness of the eye,—not an unnatural paleness,\r\nbut an absence of the redness that might have been expected when the\r\nsurface is somewhat inflamed, as is then usually the case; and this\r\npaleness he is inclined to attribute to the forcible closure of the\r\neyelids.]\r\n\r\n617 (return) [ Donders, ibid. p. 36.]\r\n\r\n618 (return) [ Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood (Dict. of English Etymology,\r\n1859, vol. i. p. 410) says, “the verb to weep comes from Anglo-Saxon\r\n_wop_, the primary meaning of which is simply outcry.”]\r\n\r\n619 (return) [ ‘De la Physionomie,’ 1865, p. 217.]\r\n\r\n620 (return) [ ‘Ceylon,’ 3rd edit. 1859, vol. ii. pp. 364, 376.

These, when irritated,\r\nscreamed violently; but it is remarkable that they never when thus\r\nscreaming contracted the muscles round the eyes. Nor did they shed\r\ntears; and the native hunters asserted that they had never observed\r\nelephants weeping. Nevertheless, it appears to me impossible to doubt\r\nSir E. Tennent’s distinct details about their weeping, supported as\r\nthey are by the positive assertion of the keeper in the Zoological\r\nGardens. It is certain that the two elephants in the Gardens, when they\r\nbegan to trumpet loudly, invariably contracted their orbicular muscles.\r\nI can reconcile these conflicting statements only by supposing that the\r\nrecently captured elephants in Ceylon, from being enraged or\r\nfrightened, desired to observe their persecutors, and consequently did\r\nnot contract their orbicular muscles, so that their vision might not be\r\nimpeded.

Hence throughout this work I shall take a similar view of\r\nthe action of the corrugator supercilii, orbicularis, pyramidalis nasi,\r\nand frontalis muscles. Dr. Duchenne, however, believes, and every\r\nconclusion at which he arrives deserves serious consideration, that it\r\nis the corrugator, called by him the sourcilier, which raises the inner\r\ncorner of the eyebrows and is antagonistic to the upper and inner part\r\nof the orbicular muscle, as well as to the pyramidalis nasi (see\r\nMécanisme de la Phys. Humaine, 1862, folio, art. v., text and figures\r\n19 to 29: octavo edit. 1862, p. 43 text). He admits, however, that the\r\ncorrugator draws together the eyebrows, causing vertical furrows above\r\nthe base of the nose, or a frown. He further believes that towards the\r\nouter two-thirds of the eyebrow the corrugator acts in conjunction with\r\nthe upper orbicular muscle; both here standing in antagonism to the\r\nfrontal muscle. I am unable to understand, judging from Henle’s\r\ndrawings (woodcut, fig. 3), how the corrugator can act in the manner\r\ndescribed by Duchenne. See, also, on this subject, Prof. Donders’\r\nremarks in the ‘Archives of Medicine,’ 1870, vol. v. p. 34. Mr. J.\r\nWood, who is so well known for his careful study of the muscles of the\r\nhuman frame, informs me that he believes the account which I have given\r\nof the action of the corrugator to be correct.

Holland was, I believe, the first to\r\nconsider the influence of mental attention on various parts of the\r\nbody, in his ‘Medical Notes and Reflections,’ 1839 p. 64. This essay,\r\nmuch enlarged, was reprinted by Sir H. Holland in his ‘Chapters on\r\nMental Physiology,’ 1858, p. 79, from which work I always quote. At\r\nnearly the same time, as well as subsequently, Prof. Laycock discussed\r\nthe same subject: see ‘Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,’ 1839,\r\nJuly, pp. 17-22. Also his ‘Treatise on the Nervous Diseases of Women,’\r\n1840, p. 110; and ‘Mind and Brain,’ vol. ii. 1860, p. 327. Dr.\r\nCarpenter’s views on mesmerism have a nearly similar bearing. The great\r\nphysiologist Müller treated (‘Elements of Physiology,’ Eng. translat.\r\nvol. ii. pp. 937, 1085) of the influence of the attention on the\r\nsenses. Sir J. Paget discusses the influence of the mind on the\r\nnutrition of parts, in his ‘Lectures on Surgical Pathology,’ 1853, vol.\r\ni. p. 39: 1 quote from the 3rd edit. revised by Prof. Turner, 1870, p.\r\n28.

It is remarkable that when this sense has thus\r\nbeen rendered more acute at any point of the body, for instance, in a\r\nfinger, it is likewise improved at the corresponding point on the\r\nopposite side of the body.]\r\n\r\n1341 (return) [ The Lancet,’ 1838, pp. 39-40, as quoted by Prof.\r\nLaycock, ‘Nervous Diseases of Women,’ 1840, p. 110.]\r\n\r\n1342 (return) [ ‘Chapters on Mental Physiology,’ 1858, pp. 91-93.]\r\n\r\n1343 (return) [ ‘Lectures on Surgical Pathology,’ 3rd edit. revised by\r\nProf. Turner, 1870, pp. 28, 31.]\r\n\r\n1344 (return) [ ‘Elements of Physiology,’ Eng. translat. vol. ii. p.\r\n938.]\r\n\r\n1345 (return) [ Prof. Laycock has discussed this point in a very\r\ninteresting manner.
