This obliging gentleman also spent many hours in\r\nconversation with the writer, answering his numerous questions with the\r\nintelligence of the scientifically trained observer. Lastly, he kindly\r\ncorrected some errors into which the author had inadvertently fallen.\r\n\r\nWhile the area covered by the writer's personal observations may be\r\nsomewhat restricted, yet the scientific bird-list at the close of the\r\nvolume widens the field so as to include the entire avi-fauna of\r\nColorado so far as known to systematic students. Besides, constant\r\ncomparison has been made between the birds of the West and the allied\r\nspecies and genera of our Central and Eastern States. For this reason\r\nthe range of the volume really extends from the Atlantic seaboard to the\r\nparks, valleys, and plateaus beyond the Continental Divide.\r\n\r\nL. S. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All are needed by each one;\r\n    Nothing is fair or good alone.\r\n    I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,\r\n    Singing at dawn on the alder bough;\r\n    I brought him home, in his nest, at even;\r\n    He sings the song, but it cheers not now,\r\n    For I did not bring home the river and sky;--\r\n    He sang to my ear,--they sang to my eye.\r\n\r\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON: _Each and All_.\r\n\r\n    Not from his fellows only man may learn\r\n    Rights to compare and duties to discern;\r\n    All creatures and all objects, in degree,\r\n    Are friends and patrons of humanity.\r\n    There are to whom the garden, grove, and field\r\n    Perpetual lessons of forbearance yield;\r\n    Who would not lightly violate the grace\r\n    The lowliest flower possesses in its place;\r\n    Nor shorten the sweet life, too fugitive,\r\n    Which nothing less than infinite Power could give.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WORDSWORTH: _Humanity_.\r\n\r\n    Sounds drop in visiting from everywhere--\r\n    The bluebird's and the robin's trill are there,\r\n    Their sweet liquidity diluted some\r\n    By dewy orchard spaces they have come.\r\n\r\nJAMES WHITCOMB RILEY: _A Child World_.\r\n\r\n    Even in the city, I\r\n    Am ever conscious of the sky;\r\n    A portion of its frame no less\r\n    Than in the open wilderness.\r\n    The stars are in my heart by night,\r\n    I sing beneath the opening light,\r\n    As envious of the bird; I live\r\n    Upon the payment, yet I give\r\n    My soul to every growing tree\r\n    That in the narrow ways I see.\r\n    My heart is in the blade of grass\r\n    Within the courtyard where I pass;\r\n    And the small, half-discovered cloud\r\n    Compels me till I cry aloud.\r\n    I am the wind that beats the walls\r\n    And wander trembling till it falls;\r\n    The snow, the summer rain am I,\r\n    In close communion with the sky.\r\n\r\nPHILIP HENRY SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS OF THE ROCKIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP AND DOWN THE HEIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo study the birds from the level plains to the crests of the peaks\r\nswimming in cloudland; to note the species that are peculiar to the\r\nvarious altitudes, as well as those that range from the lower areas to\r\nthe alpine heights; to observe the behavior of all the birds encountered\r\nin the West, and compare their habits, songs, and general deportment\r\nwith those of correlated species and genera in the East; to learn as\r\nmuch as possible about the migratory movements up and down the mountains\r\nas the seasons wax and wane,--surely that would be an inspiring prospect\r\nto any student of the feathered fraternity. For many years one of the\r\nwriter's most cherished desires has been to investigate the bird life of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. In the spring of 1899, and again in 1901, fortune\r\nsmiled upon him in the most genial way, and--in a mental state akin to\r\nrapture, it must be confessed--he found himself rambling over the plains\r\nand mesas and through the deep cañons, and clambering up the dizzy\r\nheights, in search of winged rarities.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter attention will be called to a few general facts relative\r\nto bird life in the Rockies, leaving the details for subsequent recital.\r\nAs might be expected, the towering elevations influence the movements of\r\nthe feathered tenants of the district. There is here what might be\r\ncalled a vertical migration, aside from the usual pilgrimages north and\r\nsouth which are known to the more level portions of North America. The\r\nmigratory journeys up and down the mountains occur with a regularity\r\nthat amounts to a system; yet so far as regards these movements each\r\nspecies must be studied for itself, each having manners that are all its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIn regions of a comparatively low altitude many birds, as is well known,\r\nhie to the far North to find the proper climatic conditions in which to\r\nrear their broods and spend their summer vacation, some of them going to\r\nthe subarctic provinces and others beyond. How different among the\r\nsublime heights of the Rockies! Here they are required to make a journey\r\nof only a few miles, say from five to one hundred or slightly more,\r\naccording to the locality selected, up the defiles and cañons or over\r\nthe ridges, to find the conditions as to temperature, food, nesting\r\nsites, etc., that are precisely to their taste. The wind blowing down to\r\ntheir haunts from the snowy summits carries on its wings the same\r\nkeenness and invigoration that they would find if they went to British\r\nAmerica, where the breezes would descend from the regions of snow and\r\nice beyond the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _White-Crowned Sparrows_]\r\n\r\nIt will add a little spice of detail if we take a concrete case. There\r\nis the handsome and lyrical white-crowned sparrow; in my native State,\r\nOhio, this bird is only a migrant, passing for the summer far up into\r\nCanada to court his mate and rear his family. Now remember that Colorado\r\nis in the same latitude as Ohio; but the Buckeye State, famous as it is\r\nfor furnishing presidents, has no lofty elevations, and therefore no\r\nwhite-crowns as summer residents. However, Colorado may claim this\r\ndistinction, as well as that of producing gold and silver, and\r\nfurnishing some of the sublimest scenery on the earth; for on the side\r\nof Pike's Peak, in a green, well-watered valley just below timber-line,\r\nI was almost thrown into transports at finding the white-crowns,\r\nlistening to their rhythmic choruses, and discovering their grass-lined\r\nnests by the side of the babbling mountain brook. Altitude accomplishes\r\nfor these birds what latitude does for their brothers and sisters of\r\neastern North America.\r\n\r\nThere is almost endless variety in the avi-faunal life of the Rockies.\r\nSome species breed far above timber-line in the thickets that invade the\r\nopen valleys, or clamber far up the steep mountain sides. Others ascend\r\nstill higher, building their nests on the bald summits of the loftiest\r\npeaks at an altitude of fourteen thousand feet and more, living all\r\nsummer long in an atmosphere that is as rare as it is refreshing and\r\npure. Among these alpine dwellers may be mentioned the brown-capped\r\nleucostictes, which shall be accorded the attention they deserve in\r\nanother chapter. Then, there are species which have representatives both\r\non the plains and far up in the mountain parks and valleys, such as the\r\nwestern robin, the western meadow-lark, and the mountain bluebird.\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful country there is to be observed every style of\r\nmigratory habit. A twofold migrating current must be noticed. While\r\nthere is a movement up and down the mountain heights, there is at the\r\nsame time a movement north and south, making the migratory system a\r\nperfect network of lines of travel. Some species summer in the\r\nmountains and winter on the plains; others summer in the mountains pass\r\ndown to the plains in the autumn, then wing their way farther south into\r\nNew Mexico, Mexico, Central America, and even South America, where they\r\nspend the winter, reversing this order on their return to the north in\r\nthe spring; others simply pass through this region in their vernal and\r\nautumnal pilgrimages, stopping for a short time, but spending neither\r\nthe summer nor the winter in this latitude; still others come down from\r\nthe remote north on the approach of autumn, and winter in this State,\r\neither on the plains or in the sheltering ravines and forests of the\r\nmountains, and then return to the north in the spring; and, lastly,\r\nthere are species that remain here all the year round, some of them in\r\nthe mountains, others on the plains, and others again in both\r\nlocalities. A number of hardy birds--genuine feathered Norsemen--brave\r\nthe arctic winters of the upper mountain regions, fairly revelling in\r\nthe swirling snow-storms, and it must be a terrific gale indeed that\r\nwill drive them down from their favorite habitats toward the plains.\r\n\r\nDoes the avi-fauna of the Rocky Mountain district differ widely from\r\nthat of the Eastern States? The reply must be made in the affirmative.\r\nTherefore the first work of the bird-student from the East will be that\r\nof a tyro--the identification of species. For this purpose he must have\r\nfrequent recourse to the useful manuals of Coues and Ridgway, and to the\r\ninvaluable brochure of Professor Wells W. Cooke on the \"Birds of\r\nColorado.\" In passing, it may be said that the last-named gentleman\r\nmight almost be called the Colorado Audubon or Wilson.\r\n\r\nIn studying the birds of the West, one should note that there are\r\nwestern subspecies and varieties, which differ in some respects, though\r\nnot materially, from their eastern cousins; for instance, the western\r\nrobin, the western chipping sparrow, the western lark sparrow, and the\r\nwestern nighthawk. Besides, intermediate forms are to be met with and\r\nclassified, the eastern types shading off in a very interesting process\r\ninto the western. It would be impossible for any one but a systematist\r\nwith the birds in hand to determine where the intermediate forms become\r\neither typical easterners or typical westerners.\r\n\r\nMost interesting of all to the rambler on avian lore intent is the fact\r\nthat there are many species and genera that are peculiar to the West,\r\nand therefore new to him, keeping him constantly on the _qui vive_. In\r\nColorado you will look in vain for the common blue jay, so abundant in\r\nall parts of the East; but you will be more than compensated by the\r\npresence of seven other species of the jay household. The woodpeckers of\r\nthe West (with one exception) are different from those of the East, and\r\nso are the flycatchers, the grosbeaks, the orioles, the tanagers, the\r\nhumming-birds, and many of the sparrows. Instead of the purple and\r\nbronzed grackles (the latter are sometimes seen on the plains of\r\nColorado, but are not common), the Rockies boast of Brewer's blackbird,\r\nwhose habits are not as prosaic as his name would indicate. \"Jim Crow\"\r\nshuns the mountains for reasons satisfactory to himself; not so the\r\nmagpie, the raven, and that mischief-maker, Clark's nutcracker. All of\r\nwhich keeps the bird-lover from the East in an ecstasy of surprises\r\nuntil he has become accustomed to his changed environment.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help falling into the speculative mood in view of the sharp\r\ncontrasts between the birds of the East and those of the West. Why does\r\nthe hardy and almost ubiquitous blue jay studiously avoid the western\r\nplains and mountains? Why do not the magpie and the long-crested jay\r\ncome east? What is there that prevents the indigo-bird from taking up\r\nresidence in Colorado, where his pretty western cousin, the lazuli\r\nfinch, finds himself so much at home? Why is the yellow-shafted flicker\r\nof the East replaced in the West by the red-shafted flicker? These\r\nquestions are more easily asked than answered. From the writer's present\r\nhome in eastern Kansas it is only six hundred miles to the foot of the\r\nRockies; yet the avi-fauna of eastern Kansas is much more like that of\r\nthe Eastern and New England States than that of the Colorado region.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason is largely, if not chiefly, physiological. Evidently\r\nthere are birds that flourish best in a rare, dry atmosphere, while\r\nothers naturally thrive in an atmosphere that is denser and more humid.\r\nThe same is true of people. Many persons find the climate of Colorado\r\nespecially adapted to their needs; indeed, to certain classes of\r\ninvalids it is a veritable sanitarium. Others soon learn that it is\r\ndetrimental to their health. Mayhap the same laws obtain in the bird\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nThe altitude of my home is eight hundred and eighty feet above\r\nsea-level; that of Denver, Colorado, six thousand one hundred and sixty,\r\nmaking a difference of over five thousand feet, which may account for\r\nthe absence of many eastern avian forms in the more elevated districts.\r\nSome day the dissector of birds may find a real difference in the\r\nphysiological structure of the eastern and western meadow-larks. If so,\r\nit is to be hoped he will at once publish his discoveries for the\r\nsatisfaction of all lovers of birds.\r\n\r\nIf one had time and opportunity, some intensely interesting experiments\r\nmight be tried. Suppose an eastern blue jay should be carried to the top\r\nof Pike's Peak, or Gray's, and then set free, how would he fare? Would\r\nthe muscles and tendons of his wings have sufficient strength to bear\r\nhim up in the rarefied atmosphere? One may easily imagine that he would\r\ngo wabbling helplessly over the granite boulders, unable to lift himself\r\nmore than a few feet in the air, while the pipit and the leucosticte,\r\ninured to the heights, would mount up to the sky and shout \"Ha! ha!\" in\r\ngood-natured raillery at the blue tenderfoot. And would the feathered\r\nvisitor feel a constriction in his chest and be compelled to gasp for\r\nbreath, as the human tourists invariably do? It is even doubtful whether\r\nany eastern bird would be able to survive the changed meteorological\r\nconditions, Nature having designed him for a different environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO SOME SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was night when I found lodgings in the picturesque village of\r\nManitou, nestling at the foot of the lower mountains that form the\r\nportico to Pike's Peak. Early the next morning I was out for a stroll\r\nalong the bush-fringed mountain brook which had babbled me a serenade\r\nall night. To my delight, the place was rife with birds, the first to\r\ngreet me being robins, catbirds, summer warblers, and warbling vireos,\r\nall of which, being well known in the East, need no description, but are\r\nmentioned here only to show the reader that some avian species are\r\ncommon to both the East and the West.\r\n\r\nBut let me pause to pay a little tribute to the brave robin redbreast.\r\nOf course, here he is called the \"western robin.\" His distribution is an\r\ninteresting scientific fact. I found him everywhere--on the arid plains\r\nand mesas, in the solemn pines of the deep gulches and passes, and among\r\nthe scraggy trees bordering on timber-line, over ten thousand feet above\r\nsea-level. In Colorado the robins are designated as \"western,\" forms by\r\nthe system-makers, but, even though called by a modified title, they\r\ndeport themselves, build their nests, and sing their \"cheerily,\r\ncheerily, cheer up,\" just as do their brothers and sisters of the land\r\ntoward the rising sun. If there is any difference, their songs are not\r\nso loud and ringing, and their breasts not quite so ruddy as are those\r\nof the eastern types. Perhaps the incessant sunshine of Colorado\r\nbleaches out the tints somewhat.\r\n\r\nBut in my ante-breakfast stroll at Manitou I soon stumbled upon\r\nfeathered strangers. What was this little square-shouldered bird that\r\nkept uttering a shrill scream, which he seemed to mistake for a song? It\r\nwas the western wood-pewee. Instead of piping the sweet, pensive\r\n\"Pe-e-e-o-we-e-e-e\" of the woodland bird of the Eastern States, this\r\nwestern swain persists in ringing the changes hour by hour upon that\r\npiercing scream, which sounds more like a cry of anguish than a song. At\r\nBuena Vista, where these birds are superabundant, their morning concerts\r\nwere positively painful. One thing must be said, however, in defence of\r\nthe western wood-pewee--he means well.\r\n\r\nAnother acquaintance of my morning saunter was the debonair Arkansas\r\ngoldfinch, which has received its bunglesome name, not from the State of\r\nArkansas, but from the Arkansas River, dashing down from the mountains\r\nand flowing eastwardly through the southern part of Colorado. Most\r\nnattily this little bird wears his black cap, his olive-green frock,\r\nand his bright yellow vest. You will see at once that he dresses\r\ndifferently from the American goldfinch, so well known in the East, and,\r\nfor that matter, just as well known on the plains of Colorado, where\r\nboth species dwell in harmony. There are some white markings on the\r\nwings of _Spinus psaltria_ that give them a gauze-like appearance when\r\nthey are rapidly fluttered.\r\n\r\nHis song and some of his calls bear a close resemblance to those of the\r\ncommon goldfinch, but he is by no means a mere duplicate of that bird;\r\nhe has an individuality of his own. While his flight is undulatory, the\r\nwaviness is not so deeply and distinctly marked; nor does he sing a\r\ncheery cradle-song while swinging through the ether, although he often\r\nutters a series of unmusical chirps. One of the most pleasingly pensive\r\nsounds heard in my western rambles was the little coaxing call of this\r\nbird, whistled mostly by the female, I think. No doubt it is the tender\r\nlove talk of a young wife or mother, which may account for its\r\nsurpassing sweetness.\r\n\r\nEvery lover of feathered kind is interested in what may be called\r\ncomparative ornithology, and therefore I wish to speak of another\r\nwestern form and its eastern prototype--Bullock's oriole, which in\r\nColorado takes the place of the Baltimore oriole known east of the\r\nplains all the way to the Atlantic coast. However, Bullock's is not\r\nmerely a variety or subspecies, but a well-defined species of the oriole\r\nfamily, his scientific title being _Icterus bullocki_.\r\n\r\nLike our familiar Lord Baltimore, he bravely bears black and orange; but\r\nin _bullocki_ the latter color invades the sides of the neck, head, and\r\nforehead, leaving only a small black bow for the throat and a narrow\r\nblack stripe running back over the crown and down the back of the neck;\r\nwhereas in _Icterus galbula_ the entire head and neck are black.\r\nBrilliant as Bullock's oriole is, he does not seem to be anxious to\r\ndisplay his fineries, for he usually makes it a point to keep himself\r\nensconced behind a clump of foliage, so that, while you may hear a\r\ndesultory piping in the trees, apparently inviting your confidence, it\r\nwill be a long time before you can get more than a provoking glimpse of\r\nthe jolly piper himself. \"My gorgeous apparel was not made for parade,\"\r\nseems to be his modest disclaimer.\r\n\r\nHe is quite a vocalist. Here is a quotation from my lead-pencil, dashes\r\nand all: \"Bullock's oriole--fine singer--voice stronger than orchard\r\noriole's--song not quite so well articulated or so elaborate, but louder\r\nand more resonant--better singer than the Baltimore.\" It might be added\r\nthat Bullock's, like the orchard, but unlike the Baltimore, pipes a real\r\ntune, with something of a theme running through its intermittent\r\noutbursts. The plumage of the young bird undergoes some curious\r\nchanges, and what I took to be the year-old males seemed to be the most\r\nspirited musicians.\r\n\r\nMaurice Thompson's tribute to the Baltimore oriole will apply to that\r\nbird's western kinsman. He calls him:--\r\n\r\n    \"Athlete of the air--\r\n    Of fire and song a glowing core;\"\r\n\r\nand then adds, with tropical fervor:\r\n\r\n    \"A hot flambeau on either wing\r\n      Rimples as you pass me by;\r\n    'T is seeing flame to hear you sing,\r\n      'T is hearing song to see you fly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"When flowery hints foresay the berry,\r\n      On spray of haw and tuft of brier,\r\n    Then, wandering incendiary,\r\n      You set the maple swamps afire!\"\r\n\r\nMany nests of Bullock's oriole rewarded my slight search. They are\r\nlarger and less compactly woven than the Baltimore's, and have a woolly\r\nappearance exteriorly, as if the down of the Cottonwood trees had been\r\nwrought into the fabric. Out on the plains I counted four dangling\r\nnests, old and new, on one small limb; but that, of course, was unusual,\r\nthere being only one small clump of trees within a radius of many\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Manitou many trips were taken by the zealous\r\npedestrian. Some of the dry, steep sides of the first range of mountains\r\nwere hard climbing, but it was necessary to make the effort in order to\r\ndiscover their avian resources. One of the first birds met with on these\r\nunpromising acclivities was the spurred towhee of the Rockies. In his\r\nattire he closely resembles the towhee, or \"chewink,\" of the East, but\r\nhas as an extra ornament a beautiful sprinkling of white on his back and\r\nwings, which makes him look as if he had thrown a gauzy mantle of silver\r\nover his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut his song is different from our eastern towhee's. My notes say that\r\nit is \"a cross between the song of the chewink and that of dickcissel,\"\r\nand I shall stand by that assertion until I find good reason to disown\r\nit--should that time ever come. The opening syllabication is like\r\ndickcissel's; then follows a trill of no specially definable character.\r\nThere are times when he sings with more than his wonted force, and it is\r\nthen that his tune bears the strongest likeness to the eastern towhee's.\r\nBut his alarm-call! It is no \"chewink\" at all, but almost as close a\r\nreproduction of a cat's mew as is the catbird's well-known call. Such\r\ncrosses and anomalies does this country produce!\r\n\r\nOn the arid mountain sides among the stunted bushes, cactus plants,\r\nsand, and rocks, this quaint bird makes his home, coming down into the\r\nvalleys to drink at the tinkling brooks and trill his roundelays. Many,\r\nmany times, as I was following a deep fissure in the mountains, his\r\nditty came dripping down to me from some spot far up the steep mountain\r\nside--a little cascade of song mingling with the cascades of the brooks.\r\nThe nests are usually placed under a bush on the sides of the mesas and\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAnd would you believe it? Colorado furnishes another towhee, though why\r\nhe should have been put into the Pipilo group by the ornithologists is\r\nmore than I can tell at this moment. He has no analogue in the East.\r\nTrue, he is a bird of the bushes, running sometimes like a little deer\r\nfrom one clump to another; but if you should see him mount a boulder or\r\na bush, and hear him sing his rich, theme-like, finely modulated song,\r\nyou would aver that he is closer kin to the thrushes or thrashers than\r\nto the towhees. There is not the remotest suggestion of the towhee\r\nminstrelsy in his prolonged and well-articulated melody. It would be\r\ndifficult to find a finer lyrist among the mountains.\r\n\r\nBut, hold! I have neglected to introduce this pretty Mozart of the West.\r\nHe is known by an offensive and inapt title--the green-tailed towhee.\r\nMuch more appropriately might he be called the chestnut-crowned towhee,\r\nfor his cope is rich chestnut, and the crest is often held erect, making\r\nhim look quite cavalier-like. It is the most conspicuous part of his\r\ntoilet. His upper parts are grayish-green, becoming slightly deeper\r\ngreen on the tail, from which fact he derives his common name. His white\r\nthroat and chin are a further diagnostic mark. The bright yellow of the\r\nedge of the wings, under coverts and axillaries is seldom seen, on\r\naccount of the extreme wariness of the bird.\r\n\r\nIn most of the dry and bushy places I found him at my elbow--or, rather,\r\nsome distance away, but in evidence by his mellifluous song. Let me\r\nenumerate the localities in which I found my little favorite: Forty\r\nmiles out on the plain among some bushes of a shallow dip; among the\r\nfoothills about Colorado Springs and Manitou; on many of the open bushy\r\nslopes along the cog-road leading to Pike's Peak, but never in the dark\r\nravines or thick timber; among the bushes just below timber-line on the\r\nsouthern acclivity of the peak; everywhere around the village of Buena\r\nVista; about four miles below Leadville; and, lastly, beyond the range\r\nat Red Cliff and Glenwood.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] This list was greatly enlarged in my second trip to Colorado in\r\n    1901.\r\n\r\nThe song, besides its melodious quality, is full of expression. In this\r\nrespect it excels the liquid chansons of the mountain hermit thrush,\r\nwhich is justly celebrated as a minstrel, but which does not rehearse a\r\nwell-defined theme. The towhee's song is sprightly and cheerful, wild\r\nand free, has the swing of all outdoors, and is not pitched to a minor\r\nkey. It gives you the impression that a bird which sings so blithesome a\r\nstrain must surely be happy in his domestic relations.\r\n\r\nAmong the Rockies the black-headed grosbeak is much in evidence, and so\r\nis his cheerful, good-tempered song, which is an exact counterpart of\r\nthe song of the rose-breasted grosbeak, his eastern kinsman. Neither the\r\nrose-breast nor the cardinal is to be found in Colorado, but they are\r\nreplaced by the black-headed and blue grosbeaks, the former dwelling\r\namong the lower mountains, the latter occurring along the streams of the\r\nplains. Master black-head and his mate are partial to the scrub oaks for\r\nnesting sites. I found one nest with four callow bantlings in it, but,\r\nmuch to my grief and anger, at my next call it had been robbed of its\r\nprecious treasures. A few days later, not far from the same place, a\r\nfemale was building a nest, and I am disposed to believe that she was\r\nthe mother whose children had been kidnapped.\r\n\r\nInstead of the scarlet and summer tanagers, the Rocky Mountain region is\r\nhonored with that beautiful feathered gentleman, the Louisiana tanager,\r\nmost of whose plumage is rich, glossy yellow, relieved by black on the\r\nwings, back, and tail; while his most conspicuous decoration is the\r\nscarlet or crimson tinting of his head and throat, shading off into the\r\nyellow of the breast. These colors form a picturesque combination,\r\nespecially if set against a background of green. The crimson staining\r\ngives him the appearance of having washed his face in some bright-red\r\npigment, and like an awkward child, blotched his bosom with it in the\r\nabsence of a napkin.\r\n\r\nSo far as I could analyze it, there is no appreciable difference between\r\nhis lyrical performances and those of the scarlet tanager, both being a\r\nkind of lazy, drawling song, that is slightly better than no bird music\r\nat all. One nest was found without difficulty. It was placed on one of\r\nthe lower branches of a pine tree by the roadside at the entrance to\r\nEngleman's Cañon. As a rule, the males are not excessively shy, as so\r\nmany of the Rocky Mountain birds are. The tanagers were seen far up in\r\nthe mountains, as well as among the foothills, and also at Red Cliff and\r\nGlenwood on the western side of the Divide.\r\n\r\nA unique character in feathers, one that is peculiar to the West, is the\r\nmagpie, who would attract notice wherever he should deign to live, being\r\na sort of grand sachem of the outdoor aviary. In some respects the\r\nmagpies are striking birds. In flight they present a peculiar\r\nappearance; in fact, they closely resemble boys' kites with their long,\r\nslender tails trailing in the breeze. I could not avoid the impression\r\nthat their tails were superfluous appendages, but no doubt they serve\r\nthe birds a useful purpose as rudders and balancing-poles. The magpie\r\npresents a handsome picture as he swings through the air, the iridescent\r\nblack gleaming in the sun, beautifully set off with snowy-white\r\ntrimmings on both the upper and lower surfaces of the wings. On the\r\nperch or on the wing he is an ornament to any landscape. As to his\r\nvoice--well, he is a genuine squawker. There is not, so far as I have\r\nobserved, a musical cord in his larynx,[2] and I am sure he does not\r\nprofess to be a musical genius, so that my criticism will do him no\r\ninjury. All the use he has for his voice seems to be to call his fellows\r\nto a new-found banquet, or give warning of the approach of an interloper\r\nupon his chosen preserves. His cry, if you climb up to his nest, is\r\nquite pitiful, proving that he has real love for his offspring. Perhaps\r\nthe magpies have won their chief distinction as architects. Their nests\r\nare really remarkable structures, sometimes as large as fair-sized\r\ntubs, the framework composed of good-sized sticks, skilfully plaited\r\ntogether, and the cup lined with grass and other soft material, making a\r\ncosey nursery for the infantile magpies. Then the nest proper is roofed\r\nover, and has an entrance to the apartment on either side. When you\r\nexamine the structure closely, you find that it fairly bristles with dry\r\ntwigs and sticks, and it is surprising how large some of the branches\r\nare that are braided into the domicile. All but one of the many nests I\r\nfound were deserted, for my visit was made in June, and the birds, as a\r\nrule, breed earlier than that month. Some were placed in bushes, some in\r\nwillow and cottonwood trees, and others in pines; and the birds\r\nthemselves were almost ubiquitous, being found on the plains, among the\r\nfoothills, and up in the mountains as far as the timber-line, not only\r\nclose to human neighborhoods, but also in the most inaccessible\r\nsolitudes.\r\n\r\n    [2] In this volume the author has made use of the terminology\r\n    usually employed in describing bird music. Hence such words as\r\n    \"song,\" \"chant,\" \"vocal cords,\" etc., are of frequent occurrence. In\r\n    reality the writer's personal view is that the birds are whistlers,\r\n    pipers, fluters, and not vocalists, none of the sounds they produce\r\n    being real voice tones. The reader who may desire to go into this\r\n    matter somewhat technically is referred to Maurice Thompson's\r\n    chapter entitled \"The Anatomy of Bird-Song\" in his \"Sylvan Secrets,\"\r\n    and the author's article, \"Are Birds Singers or Whistlers?\" in \"Our\r\n    Animal Friends\" for June, 1901.\r\n\r\nIn one of my excursions along a stream below Colorado Springs, one nest\r\nwas found that was still occupied by the brooding bird. It was a bulky\r\naffair, perhaps half as large as a bushel basket, placed in the crotch\r\nof a tree about thirty feet from the ground. Within this commodious\r\nstructure was a globular apartment which constituted the nest proper.\r\nThus it was roofed over, and had an entrance at each side, so that the\r\nbird could go into his house at one doorway and out at the other, the\r\nroom being too small to permit of his turning around in it. Thinking the\r\nnest might be occupied, in a tentative way I tossed a small club up\r\namong the branches, when to my surprise a magpie sprang out of the nest,\r\nand, making no outcry, swung around among the trees, appearing quite\r\nnervous and shy. When she saw me climbing the tree, she set up such a\r\nheart-broken series of cries that I permitted sentiment to get the\r\nbetter of me, and clambered down as fast as I could, rather than prolong\r\nher distress. Since then I have greatly regretted my failure to climb up\r\nto the nest and examine its contents, which might have been done without\r\nthe least injury to the owner's valuable treasures. A nestful of\r\nmagpie's eggs or bairns would have been a gratifying sight to my\r\nbird-hungry eyes.\r\n\r\nOne bird which is familiar in the East as well as the West deserves\r\nattention on account of its choice of haunts. I refer to the turtle\r\ndove, which is much hardier than its mild and innocent looks would seem\r\nto indicate. It may be remarked, in passing, that very few birds are\r\nfound in the deep cañons and gorges leading up to the higher localities;\r\nbut the doves seem to constitute the one exception to the rule; for I\r\nsaw them in some of the gloomiest defiles through which the train\r\nscurried in crossing the mountains. For instance, in the cañon of the\r\nArkansas River many of them were seen from the car window, a pair just\r\nbeyond the Royal Gorge darting across the turbulent stream to the other\r\nside. A number were also noticed in the darkest portions of the cañon of\r\nthe Grand River, where one would think not a living creature could coax\r\nsubsistence from the bare rocks and beetling cliffs. Turtle doves are so\r\nplentiful in the West that their distribution over every available\r\nfeeding ground seems to be a matter of social and economic necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Darting across the turbulent stream_\"\r\n\r\n_Turtle Doves_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALD PEAKS AND GREEN VALES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nGREEN-TAILED TOWHEE--_Pipilo chlorurus_\r\n(Male)\r\n\r\nSPURRED TOWHEE--_Pipilo megalonyx_\r\n(Male)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my chief objects in visiting the Rockies was to ascend Pike's\r\nPeak from Manitou, and make observations on the birds from the base to\r\nthe summit. A walk one afternoon up to the Halfway House and back--the\r\nHalfway House is only about one-third of the way to the top--convinced\r\nme that to climb the entire distance on foot would be a useless\r\nexpenditure of time and effort. An idea struck me: Why not ride up on\r\nthe cog-wheel train, and then walk down, going around by some of the\r\nvalleys and taking all the time needed for observations on the\r\navi-faunal tenantry? That was the plan pursued, and an excellent one it\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nWhen the puffing cog-wheel train landed me on the summit, I was fresh\r\nand vigorous, and therefore in excellent condition physically and\r\nmentally to enjoy the scenery and also to ride my hobby at will over the\r\nrealm of cloudland. The summit is a bald area of several acres, strewn\r\nwith immense fragments of granite, with not a spear of grass visible.\r\nOne of the signal-station men asked a friend who had just come up from\r\nthe plain, \"Is there anything green down below? I'd give almost\r\nanything to see a green patch of some kind.\" There was a yearning strain\r\nin his tones that really struck me as pathetic. Here were visitors\r\nrevelling in the magnificence of the panorama, their pulses tingling and\r\ntheir feelings in many cases too exalted for expression; but those whose\r\nbusiness or duty it was to remain on the summit day after day soon found\r\nlife growing monotonous, and longed to set their eyes on some patch of\r\nverdure. To the visitors, however, who were in hale physical condition,\r\nthe panorama of snow-clad ranges and isolated peaks was almost\r\noverwhelming. In the gorges and sheltered depressions of the old\r\nmountain's sides large fields of snow still gleamed in the sun and\r\nimparted to the air a frosty crispness.\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd of tourists, after posing for their photographs, had\r\ndeparted on the descending car, I walked out over the summit to see what\r\nbirds, if any, had selected an altitude of fourteen thousand one hundred\r\nand forty-seven feet above sea-level for their summer home. Below me, to\r\nthe east, stretched the gray plains running off to the skyline, while\r\nthe foothills and lower mountains, which had previously appeared so high\r\nand rugged and difficult of access, now seemed like ant-hills crouching\r\nat the foot of the giant on whose crown I stood. Off to the southwest,\r\nthe west, and the northwest, the snowy ranges towered, iridescent in\r\nthe sunlight. In contemplating this vast, overawing scene, I almost\r\nforgot my natural history, and wanted to feast my eyes for hours on its\r\never-changing beauty; but presently I was brought back to a\r\nconsciousness of my special vocation by a sharp chirp. Was it a bird, or\r\nonly one of those playful little chipmunks that abound in the Rockies?\r\nDirectly there sounded out on the serene air another ringing chirp, this\r\ntime overhead, and, to my delight and surprise, a little bird swung over\r\nthe summit, then out over the edge of the cliff, and plunged down into\r\nthe fearsome abyss of the \"Bottomless Pit.\" Other birds of the same\r\nspecies soon followed his example, making it evident that this was not a\r\nbirdless region. Unable to identify the winged aeronauts, I clambered\r\nabout over the rocks of the summit for a while, then slowly made my way\r\ndown the southern declivity of the mountain for a short distance. Again\r\nmy ear was greeted with that loud, ringing chirp, and now the bird\r\nuttering it obligingly alighted on a stone not too far away to be seen\r\ndistinctly through my binocular. Who was the little waif that had chosen\r\nthis sky-invading summit for its summer habitat? At first I mistook it\r\nfor a horned lark, and felt so sure my decision was correct that I did\r\nnot look at the bird as searchingly as I should have done, thereby\r\nlearning a valuable lesson in thoroughness. The error was corrected by\r\nmy friend, Mr. Charles E. Aiken, of Colorado Springs, who has been of\r\nnot a little service in determining and classifying the avian fauna of\r\nColorado. My new-found friend (the feathered one, I mean) was the\r\nAmerican pipit, which some years ago was known as the tit-lark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pipits_\r\n\r\n\"_Te-cheer! Te-cheer!_\"]\r\n\r\n\"Te-cheer! te-cheer! te-cheer!\" (accent strong on the second syllable)\r\nthe birds exclaimed in half-petulant remonstrance at my intrusion as I\r\nhobbled about over the rocks. Presently one of them darted up into the\r\nair; up, up, up, he swung in a series of oblique leaps and circles, this\r\nway and that, until he became a mere speck in the sky, and then\r\ndisappeared from sight in the cerulean depths beyond. All the while I\r\ncould hear his emphatic and rapidly repeated call, \"Te-cheer! te-cheer!\"\r\nsifting down out of the blue canopy. How long he remained aloft in \"his\r\nwatch-tower in the skies\" I do not know, for one cannot well count\r\nminutes in such exciting circumstances, but it seemed a long time. By\r\nand by the call appeared to be coming nearer, and the little aeronaut\r\nswept down with a swiftness that made my blood tingle, and alighted on a\r\nrock as lightly as a snowflake. Afterwards a number of other pipits\r\nperformed the same aerial exploit. It was wonderful to see them rise\r\nseveral hundred feet into the rarefied atmosphere over an abyss so deep\r\nthat it has been named the \"Bottomless Pit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pipits_\r\n\r\n\"_Up over the Bottomless Pit_\"]\r\n\r\nThe pipits frequently flitted from rock to rock, teetering their slender\r\nbodies like sandpipers, and chirping their disapproval of my presence.\r\nThey furnished some evidence of having begun the work of nest\r\nconstruction, although no nests were found, as it was doubtless still\r\ntoo early in the season. In some respects the pipits are extremely\r\ninteresting, for, while many of them breed in remote northern latitudes,\r\nothers select the loftiest summits of the Rockies for summer homes,\r\nwhere they rear their broods and scour the alpine heights in search of\r\nfood. The following interesting facts relative to them in this alpine\r\ncountry are gleaned from Professor Cooke's pamphlet on \"The Birds of\r\nColorado\":\r\n\r\n    In migration they are common throughout the State, but breed only on\r\n    the loftiest mountains. They arrive on the plains from the South\r\n    about the last of April, tarry for nearly a month, then hie to the\r\n    upper mountain parks, stopping there to spend the month of May. By\r\n    the first of June they have ascended above timber-line to their\r\n    summer home amid the treeless slopes and acclivities. Laying begins\r\n    early in July, as soon as the first grass is started. Most of the\r\n    nests are to be found at an elevation of twelve thousand to thirteen\r\n    thousand feet, the lowest known being one on Mount Audubon,\r\n    discovered on the third of July with fresh eggs. During the breeding\r\n    season these birds never descend below timber-line. The young birds\r\n    having left the nest, in August both old and young gather in flocks\r\n    and range over the bald mountain peaks in quest of such dainties as\r\n    are to the pipit taste. Some of them remain above timber-line until\r\n    October although most of them have by that time gone down into the\r\n    upper parks of the mountains. During this month they descend to the\r\n    plains, and in November return to their winter residence in the\r\n    South.\r\n\r\nWhile watching the pipits, I had another surprise. On a small, grassy\r\narea amid the rocks, about a hundred feet below the summit, a\r\nwhite-crowned sparrow was hopping about on the ground, now leaping upon\r\na large stone, now creeping into an open space under the rocks, all the\r\nwhile picking up some kind of seed or nut or insect. It was very\r\nconfiding, coming close to me, but vouchsafing neither song nor chirp.\r\nFarther on I shall have more to say about these tuneful birds, but at\r\nthis point it is interesting to observe that they breed abundantly\r\namong the mountains at a height of from eight thousand to eleven\r\nthousand feet, while the highest nest known to explorers was twelve\r\nthousand five hundred feet above the sea. One of Colorado's bird men has\r\nnoted the curious fact that they change their location between the first\r\nand second broods--that is, in a certain park at an elevation of eight\r\nthousand feet they breed abundantly in June, and then most of them leave\r\nthat region and become numerous among the stunted bushes above\r\ntimber-line, where they raise a second brood. It only remains to be\r\nproved that the birds in both localities are the same individuals, which\r\nis probable.\r\n\r\nOn a shoulder of the mountain below me, a flock of ravens alighted on\r\nthe ground, walked about awhile, uttered their hoarse croaks, and then\r\ntook their departure, apparently in sullen mood. I could not tell\r\nwhether they croaked \"Nevermore!\" or not.\r\n\r\nDown the mountain side I clambered, occasionally picking a beautiful\r\nblossom from the many brilliant-hued clusters and inhaling its\r\nfragrance. Indeed, sometimes the breeze was laden with the aroma of\r\nthese flowers, and in places the slope looked like a cultivated garden.\r\nThe only birds seen that afternoon above timber-line were those already\r\nmentioned. What do the birds find to eat in these treeless and shrubless\r\naltitudes? There are many flies, some grasshoppers, bumble-bees,\r\nbeetles, and other insects, even in these arctic regions, dwelling among\r\nthe rocks and in the short grass below them watered by the melting\r\nsnows.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past four in the afternoon I reached the timber-line,\r\nindicated by a few small, scattering pines and many thick clumps of\r\nbushes. Suddenly a loud, melodious song brought me to a standstill. It\r\ncame from the bushes at the side of the trail. Although I turned aside\r\nand sought diligently, I could not find the shy lyrist. Another song of\r\nthe same kind soon reached me from a distance. Farther down the path a\r\nwhite-crowned sparrow appeared, courting his mate. With crown-feathers\r\nand head and tail erect, he would glide to the top of a stone, then down\r\ninto the grass where his lady-love sat; up and down, up and down he\r\nscuttled again and again. My approach put an end to the picturesque\r\nlittle comedy. The lady scurried away into hiding, while the little\r\nprince with the snow-white diadem mounted to the top of a bush and\r\nwhistled the very strain that had surprised me so a little while before,\r\nfarther up the slope. Yes, I had stumbled into the summer home of the\r\nwhite-crowned sparrow, which on the Atlantic coast and the central\r\nportions of the American continent breeds far in the North.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I was regaled with a white-crown vesper concert.\r\nFrom every part of the lonely valley the voices sounded. And what did\r\nthey say? \"Oh, de-e-e-ar, de-e-ar, Whittier, Whittier,\" sometimes\r\nadding, in low, caressing tones, \"Dear Whittier\"--one of the most\r\nmelodious tributes to the Quaker poet I have ever heard. Here I also saw\r\nmy first mountain bluebird, whose back and breast are wholly blue, there\r\nbeing no rufous at all in his plumage. He was feeding a youngster\r\nsomewhere among the snags. A red-shafted flicker flew across the vale\r\nand called, \"Zwick-ah! zwick-ah!\" and then pealed out his loud call just\r\nlike the eastern yellow-shafted high-holder. Why the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion changes the lining of the flicker's wings from gold to\r\ncrimson--who can tell? A robin--the western variety--sang his\r\n\"Cheerily,\" a short distance up the hollow, right at the boundary of the\r\ntimber-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Dear Whittier_\"\r\n\r\n_White-Crowned Sparrow_]\r\n\r\nAbout half-past five I found myself a few hundred feet below timber-line\r\nin the lone valley, which was already beginning to look shadowy and a\r\nlittle uncanny, the tall ridges that leaped up at the right obscuring\r\nthe light of the declining sun. My purpose had been to find\r\naccommodations at a mountaineer's cabin far down the valley, in the\r\nneighborhood of the Seven Lakes; but I had tarried too long on the\r\nmountain, absorbed in watching the birds, and the danger now was that,\r\nif I ventured farther down the hollow, I should lose my way and be\r\ncompelled to spend the night alone in this deserted place. I am neither\r\nvery brave nor very cowardly; but, in any case, such a prospect was not\r\npleasing to contemplate. Besides, I was by no means sure of being able\r\nto secure lodgings at the mountaineer's shanty, even if I should be able\r\nto find it in the dark. There seemed to be only one thing to do--to\r\nclimb back to the signal station on the summit.\r\n\r\nI turned about and began the ascent. How much steeper the acclivities\r\nwere than they had seemed to be when I came down! My limbs ached before\r\nI had gone many rods, and my breath came short. Upward I toiled, and by\r\nthe time my trail reached the cog-road I was ready to drop from\r\nexhaustion. Yet I had not gone more than a third of the way to the top.\r\nI had had no supper, but was too weary even to crave food, my only\r\ndesire being to find some place wherein to rest. Night had now come, but\r\nfortunately the moon shone brightly from a sky that was almost clear,\r\nand I had no difficulty in following the road.\r\n\r\nWearily I began to climb up the steep cog-wheel track. Having trudged\r\naround one curve, I came to a portion of the road that stretched\r\nstraight up before me for what seemed an almost interminable distance,\r\nand, oh! the way looked so steep, almost as if it would tumble back upon\r\nmy head. Could I ever drag myself up to the next bend in the track? By\r\na prodigious effort I did this at last--it seemed \"at last\" to me, at\r\nall events--and, lo! there gleamed before me another long stretch of\r\nfour steel rails.\r\n\r\nMy breath came shorter and shorter, until I was compelled to open my\r\nmouth widely and gasp the cold, rarefied air, which, it seemed, would\r\nnot fill my chest with the needed oxygen. Sharp pains shot through my\r\nlungs, especially in the extremities far down in the chest; my head and\r\neye-balls ached, and it seemed sometimes as if they would burst; my\r\nlimbs trembled with weakness, and I tottered and reeled like a drunken\r\nman from side to side of the road, having to watch carefully lest I\r\nmight topple over the edge and meet with a serious accident. Still that\r\nrelentless track, with its quartette of steel rails, stretched steep\r\nbefore me in the distance.\r\n\r\nFor the last half mile or more I was compelled to fling myself down upon\r\nthe track every few rods to rest and recover breath. Up, up, the road\r\nclimbed, until at length I reached the point where it ceases to swing\r\naround the shoulders of the mountain, and ascends directly to the\r\nsummit. Here was the steepest climb of all. By throwing my weary frame\r\non the track at frequent intervals and resting for five minutes, taking\r\ndeep draughts of air between my parched lips, I at last came in sight of\r\nthe government building. It is neither a mansion nor a palace, not even\r\na cottage, but never before was I so glad to get a glimpse of a building\r\nerected by human hands. It was past nine o'clock when I staggered up to\r\nthe door and rang the night bell, having spent more than three hours and\r\na half in climbing about two miles and a half. Too weary to sleep, I\r\ntossed for hours on my bed. At last, however, \"nature's sweet restorer\"\r\ncame to my relief, and I slept the deep sleep of unconsciousness until\r\nseven o'clock the next morning, allowing the sun to rise upon the Peak\r\nwithout getting up to greet him. That omission may have been an\r\nunpardonable sin, for one of the chief fads of visitors is to see the\r\nsun rise from the Peak; but I must say in my defence that, in the first\r\nplace, I failed to wake up in time to witness the Day King's advent,\r\nand, in a second place, being on bird lore intent rather than scenic\r\nwonders, my principal need was to recruit my strength for the tramping\r\nto be done during the day. The sequel proved that, for my special\r\npurpose, I had chosen the wiser course.\r\n\r\nBy eight o'clock I had written a letter home, eaten a refreshing\r\nbreakfast, paying a dollar for it, and another for lodging, and was\r\nstarting down the mountain, surprised at the exhilaration I felt, in\r\nview of my extreme exhaustion of the evening before. I naturally\r\nexpected to feel stiff and sore in every joint, languid and woe-be-gone;\r\nbut such was not the case. It is wonderful how soon one recovers\r\nstrength among these heights. How bracing is the cool mountain air, if\r\nyou breathe it deeply! As I began the descent, I whistled and\r\nsang,--that is, I tried to. To be frank, it was all noise and no music,\r\nbut I must have some way of giving expression to the uplifted emotions\r\nthat filled my breast. Again and again I said to myself, \"I'm so glad!\r\nI'm so glad! I'm so glad!\" It was gladness pure and simple,--the\r\ndictionary has no other word to express it. No pen can do justice to the\r\npanorama of mountain and valley and plain as viewed from such a height\r\non a clear, crisp morning of June. One felt like exclaiming with George\r\nHerbert:\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n      The bridal of the earth and sky!\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the æsthetic value of it went, I was monarch of all I\r\nsurveyed, even though mile on mile of grandeur and glory was spread out\r\nbefore me. The quatrain of Lowell recurred to my mind:\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis heaven alone that is given away,\r\n    'Tis only God may be had for the asking;\r\n    No price is set on the lavish summer;\r\n    June may be had by poorest comer.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Peak, I watched a flock of birds eating from the\r\nwaste-heap at the Summit House. They were the brown-capped rosy finches,\r\ncalled scientifically _Leucosticte australis_. Their plumage was a rich\r\nchocolate, suffused over neck, breast, and back with intense crimson,\r\nwhile the pileum was quite black. With one exception--the white-tailed\r\nptarmigan--they range the highest in summer of all Colorado birds. They\r\nare never seen below timber-line in that season, and are not known to\r\nbreed below twelve thousand feet; thence to the tops of the highest\r\npeaks they hatch and rear their young. In August old and young swarm\r\nover the summits picking edible insects from the snow, while in winter\r\nthey descend to timber-line, where most of them remain to brave the\r\narctic weather and its frequent storms.\r\n\r\nBidding a regretful good-by to the summit, for it held me as by a\r\nmagician's spell, I hastened down the steep incline of the cog-wheel\r\nroad, past Windy Point, and turning to the right, descended across the\r\ngreen slope below the boulder region to the open, sunlit valley which I\r\nhad visited on the previous afternoon. It was an idyllic place, a\r\nveritable paradise for birds. Such a chorus as greeted me from the\r\nthroats of I know not how many white-crowned sparrows,--several dozen,\r\nperhaps,--it would have done the heart of any lover of avian minstrelsy\r\ngood to listen to. The whole valley seemed to be transfigured by their\r\nroundelays, which have about them such an air of poetry and old-world\r\nromance. During the morning I was so fortunate as to find a nest, the\r\nfirst of this species that I had ever discovered. Providence had never\r\nbefore cast my lot with these birds in their breeding haunts. The nest\r\nwas a pretty structure placed on the ground, beneath a bush amid the\r\ngreen grass, its holdings consisting of four dainty, pale-blue eggs,\r\nspeckled with brown. The female leaped from her seat as I passed near,\r\nand in that act divulged her little family secret. Although she chirped\r\nuneasily as I bent over her treasures, she had all her solicitude for\r\nnothing; the last thing I would think of doing would be to mar her\r\nmaternal prospects. As has been said, in this valley these handsome\r\nsparrows were quite plentiful; but when, toward evening, I clambered\r\nover a ridge, and descended into the valley of Moraine Lake, several\r\nhundred feet lower than the Seven Lakes valley, what was my surprise to\r\nfind not a white-crown there! The next day I trudged up to the Seven\r\nLakes, and found the white-crowns quite abundant in the copses, as they\r\nhad been farther up the hollow on the previous day; and, besides, in a\r\nboggy place about two miles below Moraine Lake there were several pairs,\r\nand I was fortunate enough to find a nest. Strange--was it not?--that\r\nthese birds should avoid the copsy swamps near Moraine Lake, and yet\r\nselect for breeding homes the valleys both above and below it. Perhaps\r\nthe valley of Moraine Lake is a little too secluded and shut in by the\r\ntowering mountains on three sides, the other places being more open and\r\nsunshiny.\r\n\r\nThe upper valley was the summer home of that musician _par excellence_\r\nof the Rockies, the green-tailed towhee, and he sang most divinely,\r\npouring out his\r\n\r\n                                 \"full heart\r\n    In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.\"\r\n\r\nHaving elsewhere described his minstrelsy and habits with more or less\r\nfulness, I need give him only this passing reference here. A little bird\r\nwith which I here first made acquaintance was an elegant species known\r\nas Audubon's warbler, which may be regarded as the western\r\nrepresentative of the myrtle warbler of the East. The two birds are\r\nalmost counterparts. Indeed, at first I mistook the Audubon for the\r\nmyrtle. The former has a yellow throat, while the latter's throat is\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nIn all the upper mountain valleys, and on the steep slopes of the\r\nwestern as well as the eastern side of the Divide, I had the Audubon\r\nwarblers often at my elbow. In summer they make their homes at an\r\naltitude of seven to eleven thousand feet, and are partial to pine\r\ntimber; indeed, I think I never found them elsewhere, save occasionally\r\namong the quaking asps. I learned to distinguish Audubon's chanson from\r\nthose of his fellow-minstrels. It is not much of a song--a rather weak\r\nlittle trill, with a kind of drawl in the vocalization that forms its\r\ndiagnostic feature. The persistency with which it is repeated on the\r\nsolitary pine-clad mountain sides constitutes its principal charm.\r\n\r\nThe winter haunts of Audubon's warblers are farther south than Colorado,\r\nmostly in Mexico and Guatemala, although a few of them remain in the\r\nsheltered mountain valleys of the western part of the United States.\r\nEarly in May they appear on the plains of eastern Colorado, where they\r\nare known only as migrants. Here a double movement presently takes\r\nplace--what might be called a longitudinal and a vertical migration--one\r\ndivision of the warbler army sweeping north to their breeding grounds in\r\nCanada, and the other wheeling westward and ascending to the alpine\r\nheights among the mountains, where they find the subartic conditions\r\nthat are congenial to their natures without travelling so great a\r\ndistance. Here they build their nests in the pine or spruce trees, rear\r\ntheir families, and as autumn approaches, descend to the plains, tarry\r\nthere a week or two, then hie to their winter homes in the South.\r\n\r\nOne of the most gorgeous tenants of this valley was Wilson's warbler.[3]\r\nIt wears a dainty little cap that is jet black, bordered in front and\r\nbelow with golden yellow, while the upper parts are rich olive and the\r\nlower parts bright yellow. These warblers were quite abundant, and were\r\nevidently partial to the thickets covering the boggy portions of the\r\nvale. While Audubon's warblers kept themselves for the most part among\r\nthe pines on the slopes and acclivities, the little black-caps preferred\r\nthe lower ground. Their songs were not brilliant performances, though\r\nrather pleasing, being short, jerky trills, somewhat lower in the scale\r\nthan those of the well-known summer warbler.\r\n\r\n    [3] Mr. Aiken says, \"The Rocky Mountain representative of Wilson's\r\n    warbler is an intermediate form, nearest the Pacific coast bird\r\n    which is distinguished as the pileolated warbler.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was stalking about in the low, boggy part of the hollow, my\r\nattention was attracted by an odd little song that came rolling down\r\nfrom the pines on the mountain side. At length, time was found to go to\r\nthe place whence the song came. What could the gay little minstrel be?\r\nSomewhere I had heard such minstrelsy--but where? There were runs in it\r\nthat bore some resemblance to certain strains of the Carolina wren's\r\nvigorous lays, but this songster's voice was of a finer quality and had\r\nless volume than that of the Carolina. The little bird was found\r\nflitting among the pines, and continued to sing his gay little ballad\r\nwith as much vigor as before. Indeed, my presence seemed to inspire him\r\nto redouble his efforts and to sing with more snap and challenge. He\r\nacted somewhat like a wren, but was smaller than any species of that\r\nfamily with which I was acquainted, and no part of his plumage was\r\nbarred with brown and white.\r\n\r\nNow the midget in feathers leaped up the alternating branches of a pine,\r\nand now he flew down and fluttered amid the chaos of dead logs and\r\nboughs on the ground, all the while rolling his ditty from his limber\r\ntongue. Beginning with an exceedingly fine whistle, which could not\r\nbe heard far away, he descanted in sounds that it is impossible to\r\nconvey in syllables. The best literation of his song that I was\r\nable to make was the following: \"Tse-e-ek, tse-e-ek, tse-e-e-ek,\r\ncholly-cholly-cholly, che-che-che, pur-tie, pur-tie, pur-tie!\" the\r\n_pur-tie_ accented strongly on the second syllable and the whole\r\nperformance closing with an interrogative inflection.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I watched the little acrobat, but could not settle his\r\nidentity. Some hours later, while stalking along the other side of the\r\nvalley, I heard the song duplicated; this time the singer elevated his\r\ncrest feathers, and at once I recognized him; he was the ruby-crowned\r\nkinglet, of course, of course! It was a shame not to identify him at\r\nfirst sight. In Ohio I had often heard his song during the migrating\r\nseason, and now remembered it well; but never dreaming that the\r\nruby-crown would be found in these alpine districts, I was completely\r\nthrown off my reckoning on hearing his quaint melodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ruby-Crowned Kinglet_\r\n\r\n\"_The singer elevated his crest feathers_\"]\r\n\r\nThe ruby-crowned kinglet migrates to these heights in the spring and\r\nrears his brood at an elevation of from nine thousand feet to the\r\ntimber-line, building a nest far up in a pine tree; whereas his eastern\r\nkindred hie to the northern part of the United States and beyond, to\r\nfind summer homes and suitable breeding grounds. Within their chosen\r\nboundaries the rubies are very plentiful in the Rockies, their quaint\r\nrondeaus tumbling down from every pine-clad acclivity. In October they\r\ndescend to the plains, and in the latter part of the month hurry off to\r\na more southerly clime.\r\n\r\nThe birds were most abundant in the upper part of the valley, keeping\r\nclose to the precipitous heights of the Peak. It was a long walk down to\r\nthe mountaineer's cabin, and I had reason to be glad for not having\r\nundertaken to find it the evening before, as I should certainly have\r\nlost my way in the darkness. No one was at home now, but through the\r\nscreen door I could see a canary in a cage. Not a very inviting place to\r\nspend the night, I reflected, and I crossed the valley, climbed a steep\r\nridge, following a slightly used wagon road, and trudged down the other\r\nside into what I afterwards found was the valley of Moraine Lake, one of\r\nthe crystal sheets of water that are seen from the summit of Pike's Peak\r\nsparkling in the sunshine. While climbing the ridge, I saw my first\r\nmountain chickadee, capering about in the trees. He called like the\r\nfamiliar black-cap, and his behavior was much like that bird's. As will\r\nbe seen in another chapter, I afterwards heard the mountain chickadee's\r\nsong on the western side of the range, and found it to be quite unlike\r\nthe minor strain of our pleasant black-cap of the East.\r\n\r\nOn the mountain side forming the descent to Moraine Lake a flock of\r\nClark's nutcrackers were flying about in the pine woods, giving\r\nexpression to their feelings in a great variety of calls, some of them\r\nquite strident. A little junco came in sight by the side of the trail,\r\nand hopped about on the ground, and I was surprised to note a reddish\r\npatch ornamenting the centre of his back. Afterwards I learned that it\r\nwas the gray-headed junco, which is distinctly a western species,\r\nbreeding among the mountains of Colorado. Thrashing about among some\r\ndead boles, and making a great to-do, were a pair of small woodpeckers,\r\nwhich closely resembled the well-known downies of our eastern\r\nlongitudes. I suppose them to have been their western representatives,\r\nwhich are known, according to Mr. Aiken and Professor Cooke, as\r\nBatchelder's woodpecker. Near the same place I saw a second pair of\r\nmountain bluebirds, flitting about somewhat nervously, and uttering a\r\ngentle sigh at intervals; but as evening was now rapidly approaching, I\r\nfelt the need of finding lodging for the night, and could not stop to\r\nhunt for their nest.\r\n\r\nFaring down the mountain side to the lake, I circled around its lower\r\nend until I came to the cottage of the family who have the care of the\r\nreservoirs that supply the three towns at the foot of the mountains\r\nwith water fresh from the snow-fields. Here, to my intense relief, I was\r\nable to secure lodging and board as long as I desired to remain.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the generous hospitality offered me for two nights and\r\nconsiderably more than one day. It was a genuine retreat, right at the\r\nfoot of a tall mountain, embowered in a grove of quaking asps. Several\r\npersons from Colorado Springs, one of them a professor of the college,\r\nwere spending their outing at the cottage, and a delightful fellowship\r\nwe had, discussing birds, literature, and mountain climbing.\r\n\r\nAfter resting awhile, I strolled up the valley to listen to the vesper\r\nconcert of the birds, and a rich one it was. The western robins were\r\npiping their blithesome \"Cheerilies,\" Audubon's warblers were trilling\r\nin the pines, and, most of all--but here I had one of the most\r\ngratifying finds in all my mountain quest. It will perhaps be remembered\r\nthat the white-crowned sparrows, so plentiful in the upper valley, were\r\nnot to be seen in the valley of Moraine Lake. Still there were\r\ncompensations in this cloistered dip among the towering mountains; the\r\nmountain hermit thrushes--sometimes called Audubon's thrushes--found the\r\nsequestered valley precisely to their liking, and on the evening in\r\nquestion I saw them and heard their pensive cadences for the first time.\r\nSuch exquisite tones, which seemed to take vocal possession of the vale\r\nand the steep, pine-clad mountain side, it has seldom been my good\r\nfortune to hear. Scores of the birds were singing simultaneously, some\r\nof their voices pitched high in the scale and others quite low, as\r\nthough they were furnishing both the air and the contralto of the\r\nchorus. It was my first opportunity to listen to the songs of any of the\r\nseveral varieties of hermit thrushes, and I freely confess that I came,\r\na willing captive, under the spell of their minstrelsy, so sweet and sad\r\nand far away, and yet so rich in vocal expression. In the latter part of\r\nthe run, which is all too brief, there is a strain which bears close\r\nresemblance to the liquid melody of the eastern wood-thrush, but the\r\nopening notes have a pathetic quality all their own. Perhaps Charles G.\r\nD. Roberts can give some idea of one's feelings at a time like this:\r\n\r\n    \"O hermit of evening! thine hour\r\n      Is the sacrament of desire,\r\n    When love hath a heavenlier flower,\r\n      And passion a holier fire.\"\r\n\r\nA happy moment it was when a nest of this mountain hermit was\r\ndiscovered, saddled on one of the lower limbs of a pine and containing\r\nfour eggs of a rich green color. These birds are partial to dense pine\r\nforests on the steep, rocky mountain sides. They are extremely shy and\r\nelusive, evidently believing that hermit thrushes ought to be heard and\r\nnot seen. A score or more may be singing at a stone's throw up an\r\nacclivity, but if you clamber toward them they will simply remove\r\nfurther up the mountain, making your effort to see and hear them at\r\nclose range unavailing. That evening, however, as the gloaming settled\r\nupon the valley, one selected a perch on a dead branch some distance up\r\nthe hillside, and obligingly permitted me to obtain a fair view of him\r\nwith my glass. The hermits breed far up in the mountains, the greatest\r\naltitude at which I found them being on the sides of Bald Mountain,\r\nabove Seven Lakes and a little below the timber-line. To this day their\r\nsad refrains are ringing in my ears, bringing back the thought of many\r\nhalf-mournful facts and incidents that haunt the memory.\r\n\r\nA good night's rest in the cottage, close beneath the unceiled roof,\r\nprepared the bird-lover for an all-day ramble. The matutinal concert was\r\nearly in full swing, the hermit thrushes, western robins, and Audubon's\r\nwarblers being the chief choralists. One gaudy Audubon's warbler visited\r\nthe quaking asp grove surrounding the cottage, and trilled the choicest\r\nselections of his repertory. Farther up the valley several Wilson's\r\nwarblers were seen and heard. A shy little bird flitting about in the\r\ntangle of grass and bushes in the swampy ground above the lake was a\r\nconundrum to me for a long time, but I now know that it was Lincoln's\r\nsparrow, which was later found in other ravines among the mountains. It\r\nis an exceedingly wary bird, keeping itself hidden amid the bushy\r\nclusters for the greater part of the time, now and then venturing to\r\npeep out at the intruder, and then bolting quickly into a safe covert.\r\nOccasionally it will hop out upon the top of a bush in plain sight, and\r\nremain for a few moments, just long enough for you to fix its identity\r\nand note the character of its pleasing trill. Some of these points were\r\nsettled afterwards and not on the morning of my first meeting with the\r\nchary little songster.\r\n\r\nMy plan for the day was to retrace my steps of the previous afternoon,\r\nby climbing over the ridge into the upper valley and visiting the famous\r\nSeven Lakes, which I had missed the day before through a miscalculation\r\nin my direction. Clark's crows and the mountain jays were abundant on\r\nthe acclivities. One of the latter dashed out of a pine bush with a\r\nclatter that almost raised the echoes, but, look as I would, I could\r\nfind no nest or young or anything else that would account for the\r\nracket.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Lakes are beautiful little sheets of transparent water,\r\nembosomed among the mountains in a somewhat open valley where there is\r\nplenty of sunshine. They are visible from the summit of Pike's Peak,\r\nfrom which distant viewpoint they sparkle like sapphire gems in a\r\nsetting of green. As seen from the Peak they appear to be quite close\r\ntogether, and the land about them seems perfectly level, but when you\r\nvisit the place itself, you learn that some of them are separated from\r\nthe others by ridges of considerable height. Beautiful and sequestered\r\nas the spot is, I did not find as many birds as I expected. Not a duck\r\nor water bird of any kind was seen. Perhaps there is too much hunting\r\nabout the lakes, and, besides, winged visitors here would have\r\nabsolutely no protection, for the banks are free of bushes of any\r\ndescription, and no rushes or flags grow in the shallower parts. On the\r\nridges and mountain sides the kinglets and hermit thrushes were\r\nabundant, a robin was carolling, a Batchelder woodpecker chirped and\r\npounded in his tumultuous way, Clark's crows and several magpies lilted\r\nabout, while below the lakes in the copses the white-crowned sparrows\r\nand green-tailed towhees held lyrical carnival, their sway disputed only\r\nby the natty Wilson's warblers.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to be alive and well in such a place, where one\r\nbreathed invigoration at every draught of the fresh, untainted mountain\r\nair; nor was it less a delight to sit on the bank of one of the\r\ntransparent lakes and eat my luncheon and quaff from a pellucid spring\r\nthat gushed as cold as ice and as sweet as nectar from the sand, while\r\nthe white-crowned sparrows trilled a serenade in the copses.\r\n\r\nToward evening I clambered down to the cottage by Moraine Lake. The next\r\nmorning, in addition to the birds already observed in the valley, I\r\nlistened to the theme-like recitative of a warbling vireo, and also\r\nwatched a sandpiper teetering about the edge of the water, while a\r\nred-shafted flicker dashed across the lake to a pine tree on the\r\nopposite side. As I left this attractive valley, the hermit thrushes\r\nseemed to waft me a sad farewell.\r\n\r\nA little over half a day was spent in walking down from Moraine Lake to\r\nthe Halfway House. It was a saunter that shall never be forgotten, for I\r\ngathered a half day's tribute of lore from the birds. A narrow green\r\nhollow, wedging itself into one of the gorges of the towering Peak, and\r\nwatered by a snow-fed mountain brook, proved a very paradise for birds.\r\nHere was that queer little midget of the Rockies, the broad-tailed\r\nhumming-bird, which performs such wonderful feats of balancing in the\r\nair; the red-shafted flicker; the western robin, singing precisely like\r\nhis eastern half-brother; a pair of house-wrens guarding their\r\ntreasures; Lincoln's sparrows, not quite so shy as those at Moraine\r\nLake; mountain chickadees; olive-sided flycatchers; on the pine-clad\r\nmountain sides the lyrical hermit thrushes; and finally those\r\nballad-singers of the mountain vales, the white-crowned sparrows, one of\r\nwhose nests I was so fortunate as to come upon. It was placed in a small\r\npine bush, and was just in process of construction. One of the birds\r\nflew fiercely at a mischievous chipmunk, and drove him away, as if he\r\nknew him for an arrant nest-robber.\r\n\r\nLeaving this enchanting spot, I trudged down the mountain valleys and\r\nravines, holding silent converse everywhere with the birds, and at\r\nlength reached a small park, green and bushy, a short distance above the\r\nHalfway House. While jogging along, my eye caught sight of a gray-headed\r\njunco, which flitted from a clump of bushes bordering the stream to a\r\nspot on the ground close to some shrubs. The act appeared so suggestive\r\nthat I decided to reconnoitre. I walked cautiously to the spot where the\r\nbird had dropped down, and in a moment she flew up with a scolding\r\nchipper. There was the nest, set on the ground in the grass and cosily\r\nhidden beneath the over-arching branches of a low bush. Had the mother\r\nbird been wise and courageous enough to retain her place, her secret\r\nwould not have been betrayed, the nest was so well concealed.\r\n\r\nThe pretty couch contained four juvenile juncos covered only with down,\r\nand yet, in spite of their extreme youth, their foreheads and lores\r\nshowed black, and their backs a distinctly reddish tint, so early in\r\nlife were they adopting the pattern worn by their parents. The\r\npersistency of species in the floral and faunal realms presents some\r\nhard nuts for the evolutionist to crack. But that is an excursus, and\r\nwould lead us too far afield. This was the first junco's nest I had ever\r\nfound, and no one can blame me for feeling gratified with the\r\ndiscovery. The gray-headed juncos were very abundant in the Rockies, and\r\nare the only species at present known to breed in the State of Colorado.\r\nThey are differentiated from the common slate-colored snowbird by their\r\nash-gray suits, modestly decorated with a rust-colored patch on the\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt was now far past noon, and beginning to feel weak with hunger, I\r\nreluctantly said adieu to the junco and her brood, and hurried on to the\r\nHalfway House, where a luncheon of sandwiches, pie and coffee\r\nstrengthened me for the remainder of my tramp down the mountain to\r\nManitou. That was a walk which lingers like a Greek legend in my memory\r\non account of--well, that is the story that remains to be told.\r\n\r\nOn a former visit to the Halfway House I was mentally knocked off my\r\nfeet by several glimpses of a woodpecker which was entirely new to me,\r\nand of whose existence I was not even aware until this gorgeous\r\ngentleman hove in sight. He was the handsomest member of the _Picidæ_\r\nfamily I have ever seen--his upper parts glossy black, some portions\r\nshowing a bluish iridescence; his belly rich sulphur yellow, a bright\r\nred median stripe on the throat, set in the midst of the black, looking\r\nlike a small necktie; two white stripes running along the side of the\r\nhead, and a large white patch covering the middle and greater\r\nwing-coverts. Altogether, an odd livery for a woodpecker. Silently he\r\nswung from bole to bole for a few minutes, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nNot until I reached my room in Manitou could I fix the bird's place in\r\nthe avicular system. By consulting Coues's _Key_ and Professor Cooke's\r\nbrochure on the _Birds of Colorado_, I found this quaintly costumed\r\nwoodpecker to be Williamson's sapsucker (_Sphyrapicus thyroideus_),\r\nknown only in the western part of the United States from the Rocky\r\nMountains to the Pacific coast. I now lingered in the beautiful pine\r\ngrove surrounding the Halfway House, hoping to see him again, but he did\r\nnot appear, and I reluctantly started down the cog-wheel track.\r\n\r\nAs I was turning a bend in the road, I caught sight of a mountain\r\nchickadee flitting to a dead snag on the slope at the right, the next\r\nmoment slipping into a small hole leading inside. I climbed up to the\r\nshelf, a small level nook among the tall pines on the mountain side, to\r\ninspect her retreat, for it was the first nest of this interesting\r\nspecies that I found. The chickadee flashed in and out of the orifice,\r\ncarrying food to her little ones, surreptitiously executing her\r\nhousewifely duties. The mountain tit seems to be a shy and quiet little\r\nbody when compared with the common black-cap known in the East.\r\n\r\nWhile watching this bird from my place of concealment, I became\r\nconscious of the half-suppressed chirping of a woodpecker, and, to my\r\nintense joy, a moment later a Williamson's sapsucker swung to a pine\r\nbole a little below me and began pecking leisurely and with assumed\r\nnonchalance for grubs in the fissures of the bark. From my hiding-place\r\nbehind some bushes I kept my eye on the handsome creature. An artist\r\nmight well covet the privilege of painting this elegant bird as he\r\nscales the wall of a pine tree. Presently he glided to a snag not more\r\nthan a rod from the chickadee's domicile, and then I noticed that the\r\ndead bole was perforated by a number of woodpecker holes, into one of\r\nwhich the sapsucker presently slipped with the tidbit he held in his\r\nbill. The doorway was almost too small for him, obliging him to turn\r\nslightly sidewise and make some effort to effect an entrance. Fortune\r\nhad treated me as one of her favorites: I had discovered the nest of\r\nWilliamson's sapsucker.\r\n\r\nBut still another surprise was in store. A low, dubious chirping was\r\nheard, and then the female ambled leisurely to the snag and hitched up\r\nto the orifice. She made several efforts to enter, but could not while\r\nher spouse was within. Presently he wormed himself out, whereupon she\r\nwent in, and remained for some time. At length I crept to the snag and\r\nbeat against it with my cane. She was loath to leave the nest, but after\r\na little while decided that discretion was the better part of valor.\r\nWhen she came out, my presence so near her nursery caused her not a\r\nlittle agitation, which she displayed by flinging about from bole to\r\nbole and uttering a nervous chirp.\r\n\r\nAs to costume, the male and the female had little in common. Her back\r\nwas picturesquely mottled and barred with black and white, her head\r\nlight brown, her breast decorated with a large black patch, and her\r\nother under parts yellow. Had the couple not been seen together flitting\r\nabout the nest, they would not have been regarded as mates, so\r\ndifferently were they habited.\r\n\r\nStanding before the doorway of the nursery--it was not quite so high as\r\nmy head--I could plainly hear the chirping of the youngsters within.\r\nMuch as I coveted the sight of a brood of this rare species, I could not\r\nbring myself to break down the walls of their cottage and thus expose\r\nthem to the claws and beaks of their foes. Even scientific curiosity\r\nmust be restrained by considerations of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe liege lord of the family had now disappeared. Desirous of seeing him\r\nonce more, I hid myself in a bush-clump near at hand and awaited his\r\nreturn. Presently he came ambling along and scrambled into the orifice,\r\nturning his body sidewise, as he had done before. I made my way quietly\r\nto the snag and tapped upon it with my cane, but he did not come out, as\r\nI expected him to do. Then I struck the snag more vigorously. No result.\r\nThen I whacked the bole directly in the rear of the nest, while I stood\r\nclose at one side watching the doorway. The bird came to the orifice,\r\npeeped out, then, seeing me, quickly drew back, determined not to desert\r\nhis brood in what he must have regarded as an emergency. In spite of all\r\nmy pounding and coaxing and feigned scolding--and I kept up the racket\r\nfor several minutes--I did not succeed in driving the _pater familias_\r\nfrom his post of duty. Once he apparently made a slight effort to\r\nescape, but evidently stuck fast in the entrance, and so dropped back\r\nand would not leave, only springing up to the door and peeping out at me\r\nwhen my appeals became especially vigorous. It appeared like a genuine\r\ncase of \"I'm determined to defend my children, or die in the attempt!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mother bird was flitting about in an agitated way,\r\nuttering piteous cries of remonstrance and entreaty. Did that bandit\r\nintend to rob her of both her husband and her children? It was useless,\r\nif not wanton, to hector the poor creatures any longer, even to study\r\ntheir behavior under trying circumstances; and I left them in peace, and\r\nhurried down to my lodgings in Manitou, satisfied with the results of my\r\nday's ramble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS OF THE ARID PLAIN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nLAZULI BUNTING--_Cyanospiza amoena_\r\n(Upper figure, male; lower, female)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving explored the summit of Pike's Peak and part of its southern slope\r\ndown to the timber-line, and spent several delightful days in the upper\r\nvalleys of the mountains, as well as in exploring several cañons, the\r\nrambler was desirous of knowing what species of birds reside on the\r\nplain stretching eastward from the bases of the towering ranges. One\r\nafternoon in the latter part of June, I found myself in a straggling\r\nvillage about forty miles east of Colorado Springs.\r\n\r\nOn looking around, I was discouraged, and almost wished I had not come;\r\nfor all about me extended the parched and treeless plain, with only here\r\nand there a spot that had a cast of verdure, and even that was of a dull\r\nand sickly hue. Far off to the northeast rose a range of low hills\r\nsparsely covered with scraggy pines, but they were at least ten miles\r\naway, perhaps twenty, and had almost as arid an aspect as that of the\r\nplains themselves. Only one small cluster of deciduous trees was\r\nvisible, about a mile up a shallow valley or \"draw.\" Surely this was a\r\nmost unpromising field for bird study. If I had only been content to\r\nremain among the mountains, where, even though the climbing was\r\ndifficult, there were brawling brooks, shady woodlands, and green, copsy\r\nvales in which many feathered friends had lurked!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Desert Horned Larks_\r\n\r\n\"_They were plentiful in this parched region_\"]\r\n\r\nBut wherever the bird-lover chances to be, his mania leads him to look\r\nfor his favorites, and he is seldom disappointed; rather, he is often\r\ndelightfully surprised. People were able to make a livelihood here, as\r\nwas proved by the presence of the village and a few scattering dwellings\r\non the plain; then why not the birds, which are as thrifty and wise in\r\nmany ways as their human relatives? In a short time my baggage was\r\nstowed in a safe place, and, field-glass in hand, I sallied forth for my\r\nfirst jaunt on a Colorado plain. But, hold! what were these active\r\nlittle birds, hopping about on the street and sipping from the pool by\r\nthe village well? They were the desert horned larks, so called because\r\nthey select the dry plains of the West as their dwelling place. They are\r\ninteresting birds. The fewer trees and the less humidity, provided\r\nthere is a spot not too far away at which they may quench their thirst\r\nand rinse their feathers, the better they seem to be pleased. They were\r\nplentiful in this parched region, running or flying cheerfully before me\r\nwherever my steps were bent. I could not help wondering how many\r\nthousands of them--and millions, perhaps--had taken up free homesteads\r\non the seemingly limitless plains of eastern Colorado.\r\n\r\nMost of the young had already left the nest, and were flying about in\r\nthe company of their elders, learning the fine art of making a living\r\nfor themselves and evading the many dangers to which bird flesh is heir.\r\nThe youngsters could readily be distinguished from their seniors by the\r\nabsence of distinct black markings on throat, chest, and forehead, and\r\nthe lighter cast of their entire plumage.\r\n\r\nSometimes these birds are called shore larks; but that is evidently a\r\nmisnomer, or at least a very inapt name, for they are not in the least\r\npartial to the sea-shore or even the shores of lakes, but are more\r\ndisposed to take up their residence in inland and comparatively dry\r\nregions. There are several varieties, all bearing a very close\r\nresemblance, so close, indeed, that only an expert ornithologist can\r\ndistinguish them, even with the birds in hand. The common horned lark is\r\nwell known in the eastern part of the United States as a winter\r\nresident, while in the middle West, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, etc.,\r\nare to be found the prairie horned larks, which, as their name\r\nindicates, choose the open prairie for their home. The desert horned\r\nlarks are tenants exclusively of the arid plains, mesas, and mountain\r\nparks of the West. There is still another variety, called the pallid\r\nhorned lark, which spends the winter in Colorado, then hies himself\r\nfarther north in summer to rear his brood.\r\n\r\nAs I pursued my walk, one of these birds suddenly assumed an alert\r\nattitude, then darted into the air, mounting up, up, up, in a series of\r\nswift leaps, like \"an embodied joy whose race has just begun.\" Up he\r\nsoared until he could no longer be seen with the naked eye, and even\r\nthrough my field-glass he was a mere speck against the blue canopy, and\r\nyet, high as he had gone, his ditty filtered down to me through the\r\nstill, rarefied atmosphere, like a sifting of fine sand. His descent was\r\na grand plunge, made with the swiftness of an Indian's arrow, his head\r\nbent downward, his wings partly folded, and his tail perked upward at\r\nprecisely the proper angle to make a rudder, all the various organs so\r\nfinely adjusted as to convert him into a perfectly dirigible parachute.\r\nSwift as his descent was, he alighted on the ground as lightly as a tuft\r\nof down. It was the poetry of motion. One or two writers have insisted\r\nthat the horned lark's empyrean song compares favorably with that of\r\nthe European skylark; but, loyal and patriotic an American as we are,\r\nhonesty compels us to concede that our bird's voice is much feebler and\r\nless musical than that of his celebrated relative across the sea. It\r\nsounds like the unmelodious clicking of pebbles, while the song of the\r\nskylark is loud, clear, and ringing.\r\n\r\nOur birds of the plain find insects to their taste in the short grass\r\nwhich carpets the land with greenish or olive gray. The following\r\nmorning a mother lark was seen gathering insects and holding them in her\r\nbill--a sure sign of fledglings in the near neighborhood. I decided to\r\nwatch her, and, if possible, find her bantlings. It required not a\r\nlittle patience, for she was wary and the sun poured down a flood of\r\nalmost blistering heat. This way and that she scurried over the ground,\r\nnow picking up an insect and adding it to the store already in her bill,\r\nand now standing almost erect to eye me narrowly and with some\r\nsuspicion. At length she seemed to settle down for a moment upon a\r\nparticular spot, and when I looked again with my glass, her beak was\r\nempty. I examined every inch of ground, as I thought, in the\r\nneighborhood of the place where she had stopped, but could find neither\r\nnest nor nestlings.\r\n\r\nAgain I turned my attention to the mother bird, which meanwhile had\r\ngathered another bunch of insects and was hopping about with them\r\nthrough the croppy grass, now and then adding to her accumulation until\r\nher mouth was full. For a long time she zigzagged about, going by\r\nprovoking fits and starts. At length fortune favored me, for through my\r\nlevelled glass I suddenly caught sight of a small, grayish-looking ball\r\nhopping and tumbling from a cactus clump toward the mother bird, who\r\njabbed the contents of her bill into a small, open mouth. I followed a\r\nbee-line to the spot, and actually had to scan the ground sharply for a\r\nfew moments before I could distinguish the youngster from its\r\nsurroundings, for it had squatted flat, its gray and white plumage\r\nharmonizing perfectly with the grayish desert grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lark_\r\n\r\n\"_It was a dear little thing_\"]\r\n\r\nIt was a dear little thing, and did not try to escape, although I took\r\nit up in my hand and stroked its downy back again and again. Sometimes\r\nit closed its eyes as if it were sleepy. When I placed it on the ground,\r\nit hopped away a few inches, and by accident punctured the fleshy corner\r\nof its mouth with a sharp cactus thorn, and had to jerk itself loose,\r\nbringing the blood from the lacerated part. Meanwhile the mother lark\r\nwent calmly about her household duties, merely keeping a watchful eye\r\non the human meddler, and making no outcry when she saw her infant in my\r\npossession. I may have been _persona non grata_, but, if so, she did not\r\nexpress her feeling. This was the youngest horned lark seen by me in my\r\nrambles on the plains.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will care to know something about the winter habits\r\nof these birds. They do not spend the season of cold and storm in the\r\nmountains, not even those that breed there, for the snow is very deep\r\nand the tempests especially fierce. Many of them, however, remain in the\r\nfoothills and on the mesas and plains, where they find plenty of seeds\r\nand berries for their sustenance, unless the weather chances to be\r\nunusually severe. One winter, not long ago, the snow continued to lie\r\nmuch longer than usual, cutting off the natural food supply of the\r\nlarks. What regimen did they adopt in that exigency? They simply went to\r\ntown. Many of the kindly disposed citizens of Colorado Springs scattered\r\ncrumbs and millet seeds on the streets and lawns, and of this supply the\r\nlittle visitors ate greedily, becoming quite tame. As soon, however, as\r\nthe snow disappeared they took their departure, not even stopping to say\r\nthanks or adieu; although we may take it for granted that they felt\r\ngrateful for favors bestowed.\r\n\r\nBesides the horned larks, many other birds were found on the plain. Next\r\nin abundance were the western meadow-larks. Persons who live in the\r\nEast and are familiar with the songs of the common meadow-lark, should\r\nhear the vocal performances of the westerners. The first time I heard\r\none of them, the minstrelsy was so strange to my ear, so different from\r\nanything I had ever heard, I was thrown into an ecstasy of delight, and\r\ncould not imagine from what kind of bird larynx so quaint a medley could\r\nemanate. The song opened with a loud, fine, piercing whistle, and ended\r\nwith an abrupt staccato gurgle much lower in the musical staff, sounding\r\nprecisely as if the soloist's performance had been suddenly choked off\r\nby the rising of water in the windpipe. It was something after the order\r\nof the purple martin's melodious sputter, only the tones were richer and\r\nfuller and the music better defined, as became a genuine oscine. His\r\nsudden and emphatic cessation seemed to indicate that he was in a\r\npetulant mood, perhaps impatient with the intruder, or angry with a\r\nrival songster.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I heard him--or, rather, one of his brothers--sing arias so\r\nsurpassingly sweet that I voted him the master minstrel of the western\r\nplains, prairies, and meadows. One evening as I was returning to\r\nColorado Springs from a long tramp through one of the cañons of the\r\nmountains, a western meadow-lark sat on a small tree and sang six\r\ndifferent tunes within the space of a few minutes. Two of them were so\r\nexquisite and unique that I involuntarily sprang to my feet with a cry\r\nof delight. There he sat in the lengthening shadows of Cheyenne\r\nMountain, the champion phrase-fluter of the irrigated meadow in which he\r\nand a number of his comrades had found a summer home.\r\n\r\nOn the plain, at the time of my visit, the meadow-larks were not quite\r\nso tuneful, for here the seasons are somewhat earlier than in the\r\nproximity of the mountains, and the time of courtship and incubation was\r\nover. Still, they sang enough to prove themselves members of a gifted\r\nmusical family. Observers in the East will remember the sputtering call\r\nof the eastern larks when they are alarmed or their suspicions are\r\naroused. The western larks do not utter alarums of that kind, but a\r\nharsh \"chack\" instead, very similar to the call of the grackles. The\r\nnesting habits of the eastern and western species are the same, their\r\ndomiciles being placed on the ground amid the grass, often prettily\r\narched over in the rear and made snug and neat.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, because my monograph on the western larks is\r\nincluded in this chapter, that they dwell exclusively on the arid plain.\r\nNo; they revel likewise in the areas of verdure bordering the streams,\r\nin the irrigated fields and meadows, and in the watered portions of the\r\nupper mountain parks.\r\n\r\nAn interesting question is the following: Are the eastern and western\r\nmeadow-larks distinct species, or only varieties somewhat specialized by\r\ndifferences of locality and environment? It is a problem over which the\r\nscientific professors have had not a little disputation. My own opinion\r\nis that they are distinct species and do not cohabit, and the conviction\r\nis based on some special investigations, though not of the kind that are\r\nmade with the birds in hand. It has been my privilege to study both\r\nforms in the field. In the first place, their vocal exhibitions are very\r\ndifferent, so much so as to indicate a marked diversity in the organic\r\nstructure of their larynxes. Much as I have listened to their\r\nminstrelsy, I have never known one kind to borrow from the musical\r\nrepertory of the other. True, there are strains in the arias of the\r\nwesterners that closely resemble the clear, liquid whistle of the\r\neastern larks, but they occur right in the midst of the song and are\r\npart and parcel of it, and therefore afford no evidence of mimicry or\r\namalgamation. Even the trills of the grassfinch and the song-sparrow\r\nhave points of similarity; does that prove that they borrow from each\r\nother, or that espousals sometimes occur between the two species?\r\n\r\nThe habiliments of the two forms of larks are more divergent than would\r\nappear at first blush. Above, the coloration of _neglecta_ (the western)\r\nis paler and grayer than that of _magna_, the black markings being less\r\nconspicuous, and those on the tertials and middle tail-feathers being\r\narranged in narrow, isolated bars, and not connected along the shaft.\r\nWhile the flanks and under tail-coverts of _magna_ are distinctly washed\r\nwith buff, those of _neglecta_ are white, very faintly tinged with buff,\r\nif at all. The yellow of the throat of the eastern form does not spread\r\nout laterally over the malar region, as does that of the western lark.\r\nAll of which tends to prove that the two forms are distinct.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1901 the writer took a trip to Oklahoma in the\r\ninterest of bird-study, and found both kinds of meadow-larks extremely\r\nabundant and lavish of their melodies on the fertile prairies. He\r\ndecided to carry on a little original investigation in the field of\r\ninquiry now under discussion. One day, in a draw of the prairie, he\r\nnoticed a western meadow-lark which was unusually lyrical, having the\r\nskill of a past-master in the art of trilling and gurgling and fluting.\r\nAgain and again I went to the place, on the same day and on different\r\ndays, and invariably found the westerner there, perching on the fence or\r\na weed-stem, and greeting me with his exultant lays. But, mark: no\r\neastern lark ever intruded on his preserve. In other and more distant\r\nparts of the broad field the easterners were blowing their piccolos, but\r\nthey did not encroach on the domain of the lyrical westerner, who, with\r\nhis mate--now on her nest in the grass--had evidently jumped his claim\r\nand held it with a high hand. In many other places in Oklahoma and\r\nKansas where both species dwell, I have noticed the same interesting\r\nfact--that in the breeding season each form selects a special precinct,\r\ninto which the other form does not intrude. They perhaps put up some\r\nkind of trespass sign. These observations have all but convinced me that\r\n_S. magna_ and _S. neglecta_ are distinct species, and avoid getting\r\nmixed up in their family affairs.\r\n\r\nNor is that all. While both forms dwell on the vast prairies of\r\nOklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, yet, as you travel eastward, the western\r\nlarks gradually diminish in number until at length they entirely\r\ndisappear; whereas, if you journey westward, the precise opposite\r\noccurs. I have never heard _neglecta_ east of the Missouri River,[4] nor\r\n_magna_ on the plains of Colorado. Therefore the conclusion is almost\r\nforced upon the observer that there are structural and organic\r\ndifferences between the two forms.\r\n\r\n    [4] He sometimes ventures, though sparingly, as far east as Illinois\r\n    and Wisconsin; still my statement is true--I have never heard the\r\n    western lark even in the bottoms and meadows of the broad valley\r\n    east of the Missouri River, while, one spring morning, I did hear\r\n    one of these birds fluting in the top of a cottonwood tree in my\r\n    yard on the high western bluff of that stream.\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing deductions had been reached, the writer bethought\r\nhim of consulting Ridgway's Manual on the subject, and was gratified to\r\nfind his views corroborated by a footnote answering to an asterisk\r\naffixed to the name of the western lark:\r\n\r\n    \"Without much doubt a distinct species. The occurrence of both _S.\r\n    neglecta_ and _S. magna_ together in many portions of the\r\n    Mississippi Valley, each in its typical style (the ranges of the two\r\n    overlapping, in fact, for a distance of several hundred miles),\r\n    taken together with the excessive rarity of intermediate specimens\r\n    and the universally attested radical difference in their notes, are\r\n    facts wholly incompatible with the theory of their being merely\r\n    geographical races of the same species.\"\r\n\r\nThis has been a long _excursus_, and we must get back to our jaunt on\r\nthe plain. While I was engaged in watching the birds already named, my\r\near was greeted by a loud, clear, bell-like call; and, on looking in the\r\ndirection from which it came, I observed a bird hovering over a ploughed\r\nfield not far away, and then descending with graceful, poising flight to\r\nthe ground. It proved to be the Arkansas flycatcher, a large, elegant\r\nbird that is restricted to the West. I had never seen this species.\r\nNothing like him is known in the East, the crested flycatcher being most\r\nnearly a copy of him, although the manners of the two birds are quite\r\nunlike. The body of the western bird is as large as that of the robin,\r\nand he must be considerably longer from tip of beak to tip of tail. He\r\nis a fine-looking fellow, presenting a handsome picture as he stands on\r\na weed-stalk or a fence-post, his yellow jacket gleaming in the sun. He\r\nis the possessor of a clear, musical voice, and if he had the vocal\r\norgans of some of the oscines, he certainly would be one of the best\r\nfeathered lyrists of America. Unfortunately he is able to do nothing but\r\nchirp and chatter, although he puts not a little music into his simple\r\nvocal exercises.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising to note on how slender a weed-stalk so large a bird\r\nwas able to perch. There being few trees and fences in this region, he\r\nhas doubtless gained expertness through practice in the art of securing\r\na foot-hold on the tops of the weed-stems. Some of the weeds on which he\r\nstood with perfect ease and grace were extremely lithe and flexible and\r\nalmost devoid of branches.\r\n\r\nBut what was the cause of this particular bird's intense solicitude? It\r\nwas obvious there was a nest in the neighborhood. As I sought in the\r\ngrass and weed-clumps, he uttered his piercing calls of protest and\r\ncircled and hovered overhead like a red-winged blackbird. Suddenly the\r\nthought occurred to me that the flycatchers of my acquaintance do not\r\nnest on the ground, but on trees. I looked around, and, sure enough, in\r\nthe shallow hollow below me stood a solitary willow tree not more than\r\nfifteen or twenty feet high, the only tree to be seen within a mile. And\r\nthat lone tree on the plain was occupied by the flycatcher and his mate\r\nfor a nesting place. In a crotch the gray cottage was set, containing\r\nthree callow babies and one beautifully mottled egg.\r\n\r\nIn another fork of the same small tree a pair of kingbirds--the same\r\nspecies as our well-known eastern bee-martins--had built their nest, in\r\nthe downy cup of which lay four eggs similarly decorated with brown\r\nspots. The birds now all circled overhead and joined in an earnest plea\r\nwith me not to destroy their homes and little ones, and I hurriedly\r\nclimbed down from the tree to relieve their agitation, stopping only a\r\nmoment to examine the twine plaited into the felted nests of the\r\nkingbirds. The willow sapling contained also the nest of a turtle dove.\r\n\r\n\"If there are three nests in this small tree, there may be a large\r\nnumber in the cluster of trees beyond the swell about a mile away,\" I\r\nmused, and forthwith made haste to go to the place indicated. I was not\r\ndisappointed. Had the effort been made, I am sure two score of nests\r\nmight have been found in these trees, for they were liberally decorated\r\nwith bird cots and hammocks. Most of these were kingbirds' and Arkansas\r\nflycatchers' nests, but there were others as well. On one small limb\r\nthere were four of the dangling nests of Bullock's orioles, one of them\r\nfresh, the rest more or less weather beaten, proving that this bird had\r\nbeen rearing broods here for a number of seasons.\r\n\r\nWhose song was this ringing from one of the larger trees a little\r\nfarther down the glade? I could scarcely believe the testimony of my\r\nears and eyes, yet there could be no mistake--it was the vivacious\r\nmimicry of the mocking-bird, which had travelled far across the plain to\r\nthis solitary clump of trees to find singing perches and a site for his\r\nnests. He piped his musical miscellany with as much good-cheer as if he\r\nwere dwelling in the neighborhood of some embowered cottage in\r\nDixie-land. In suitable localities on the plains of Colorado the mockers\r\nwere found to be quite plentiful, but none were seen among the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nA network of twigs and vines in one of the small willows afforded a\r\nsupport and partial covert for the nest of a pair of white-rumped\r\nshrikes. It contained six thickly speckled eggs, and was the first nest\r\nof this species I had ever found. The same hollow,--if so shallow a dip\r\nin the plain can be called a hollow,--was selected as the home of\r\nseveral pairs of red-winged and Brewer's blackbirds, which built their\r\ngrassy cots in the low bushes of a slightly boggy spot, where a feeble\r\nspring oozed from the ground. It was a special pleasure to find a\r\ngreen-tailed towhee in the copse of the draw, for I had supposed that he\r\nalways hugged close to the steep mountain sides.\r\n\r\nA walk before breakfast the next morning added several more avian\r\nspecies to my roll. To my surprise, a pair of mountain bluebirds had\r\nchosen the village for their summer residence, and were building a nest\r\nin the coupler of a freight car standing on a side track. The domicile\r\nwas almost completed, and I could not help feeling sorry for the pretty,\r\ninnocent couple, at the thought that the car would soon be rolling\r\nhundreds of miles away, and all their loving toil would go for naught.\r\nBluebirds had previously been seen at the timber-line among the\r\nmountains, and here was a pair forty miles out on the plain--quite a\r\nrange for this species, both longitudinally and vertically.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon the following birds were observed: A family of\r\njuvenile Arkansas flycatchers, which were being fed by their parents; a\r\nhalf-dozen or more western grassfinches, trilling the same pensive tunes\r\nas their eastern half-brothers; a small, long-tailed sparrow, which I\r\ncould not identify at the time, but which I now feel certain was\r\nLincoln's sparrow; these, with a large marsh-harrier and a colony of\r\ncliff-swallows, completed my bird catalogue at this place. It may not be\r\namiss to add that several jack-rabbits went skipping over the swells;\r\nthat many families of prairie dogs were visited, and that a coyotte\r\ngalloped lightly across the plain, stopping and looking back\r\noccasionally to see whether he were being pursued.\r\n\r\nIt was no difficult task to study the birds on the plain. Having few\r\nhiding-places in a locality almost destitute of trees and bushes, where\r\neven the grass was too short to afford a covert, they naturally felt\r\nlittle fear of man, and hence were easily approached. Their cousins\r\nresiding in the mountains were, as a rule, provokingly wary. The number\r\nof birds that had pre-empted homesteads on the treeless wastes was\r\nindeed a gratifying surprise, and I went back to the mountains refreshed\r\nby the pleasant change my brief excursion upon the plains had afforded\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Coyotte_\r\n\r\n\"_Looking back to see whether he were being pursued_\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRETTY HUMMER\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do you suppose I got my first glimpse of the mite in feathers\r\ncalled the broad-tailed humming-bird? It was in a green bower in the\r\nRocky Mountains in plain sight of the towering summit of Pike's Peak,\r\nwhich seemed almost to be standing guard over the place. Two brawling\r\nmountain brooks met here, and, joining their forces, went with increased\r\nspeed and gurgle down the glades and gorges. As they sped through this\r\nravine, they slightly overflowed their banks, making a boggy area of\r\nabout an acre as green as green could be; and here amid the grass and\r\nbushes a number of birds found a pleasant summer home, among them the\r\ndainty hummer.\r\n\r\nFrom the snow-drifts, still to be seen in the sheltered gorges of Pike's\r\nPeak, the breezes would frequently blow down into the nook with a\r\nfreshness that stimulated like wine with no danger of intoxicating; and\r\nit was no wonder that the white-crowned sparrows, Lincoln's sparrows,\r\nthe robins and wrens, and several other species, found in this spot a\r\npleasant place to live. One of the narrow valleys led directly up to the\r\nbase of the massive cone of the Peak, its stream fed by the snow-fields\r\nshining in the sun. Going around by the valley of Seven Lakes, I had\r\nwalked down from the summit, but nowhere had I seen the tiny hummer\r\nuntil I reached the green nook just described. Still, he sometimes\r\nascends to an elevation of eleven thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n_ONE OF THE SEVEN LAKES_\r\n\r\n_PIKE'S PEAK shows dimly in the background, more plainly in the\r\nreflection. Viewed from the peak, the lakes sparkle like opaline gems in\r\nthe sun. The waters are so clear that an inverted world is seen in their\r\ntransparent depths. The valley is an elysium for many kinds of birds,\r\nmost of them described in the text. The white-crowned sparrows love the\r\nshores of these beautiful lakes, which mirror the blithe forms of the\r\nbirds. The pine forests of the mountain sides are vocal with the\r\nrefrains of the hermit thrushes._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur feathered dot is gorgeous with his metallic green upper parts,\r\nbordered on the tail with purplish black, his white or grayish under\r\nparts, and his gorget of purple which gleams in bright, varying tints in\r\nthe sun. He closely resembles our common ruby-throated humming-bird,\r\nwhose gorget is intense crimson instead of purple, and who does not\r\nventure into the Rocky Mountain region, but dwells exclusively in the\r\neastern part of North America. It is a little strange that the eastern\r\npart of our country attracts only one species of the large hummer\r\nfamily, while the western portion, including the Rocky Mountain region,\r\ncan boast of at least seventeen different kinds as summer residents or\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first directed to the broad-tailed hummer by seeing him\r\ndarting about in the air with the swiftness of an arrow, sipping honey\r\nfrom the flower cups, and then flying to the twigs of a dead tree that\r\nstood in the marsh. There he sat, turning his head this way and that,\r\nand watching me with his keen little eyes. It was plain he did not trust\r\nme, and therefore resented my presence. Though an unwelcome guest, I\r\nprolonged my call for several hours, during which I made many heroic but\r\nvain attempts to find his nest.\r\n\r\nBut what was the meaning of a sharp, insect-like buzzing that fell at\r\nintervals on my ear? Presently I succeeded in tracing the sound to the\r\nhummer, which utters it whenever he darts from his perch and back again,\r\nespecially if there is a spectator or a rival near at hand, for whom he\r\nseems in this way to express his contempt. It is a vocal sound, or, at\r\nleast, it comes from his throat, and is much louder and sharper than the\r\n_susurrus_ produced by the rapid movement of his wings. This I ascertain\r\nby hearing both the sounds at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut the oddest prank which this hummer performs is to dart up in the\r\nair, and then down, almost striking a bush or a clump of grass at each\r\ndescent, repeating this feat a number of times with a swiftness that the\r\neye can scarcely follow. Having done this, he will swing up into the air\r\nso far that you can scarcely see him with the naked eye; the next moment\r\nhe will drop into view, poise in mid-air seventy-five or a hundred feet\r\nabove your head, supporting himself by a swift motion of the wings, and\r\nsimply hitching to right and left in short arcs, as if he were fixed on\r\na pivot, sometimes meanwhile whirling clear around. There he hangs on\r\nhis invisible axis until you grow tired watching him, and then he darts\r\nto his favorite perch on the dead tree.\r\n\r\nNo doubt John Vance Cheney had in mind another species when he composed\r\nthe following metrical description, but it aptly characterized the\r\nvolatile broad-tail as well:\r\n\r\n    \"Voyager on golden air,\r\n    Type of all that's fleet and fair,\r\n    Incarnate gem,\r\n    Live diadem,\r\n    Bird-beam of the summer day,--\r\n    Whither on your sunny way?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Stay, forget lost Paradise,\r\n    Star-bird fallen from happy skies.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that first meeting the broad-tailed hummers were frequently seen\r\nin my rambles among the Rockies. In some places there were small\r\ncolonies of them. They did not always dwell together in harmony, but\r\noften pursued one another like tiny furies, with a loud z-z-z-zip that\r\nmeant defiance and war. The swiftness of their movements often excited\r\nmy wonder, and it was difficult to see how they kept from impaling\r\nthemselves on thorns or snags, so reckless were their lightning-like\r\npassages through the bushes and trees. When four or five of them were\r\nfound in one place, they would fairly thread the air with green and\r\npurple as they described their circles and loops and festoons with a\r\nrapidity that fairly made my head whirl. At one place several of them\r\ngrew very bold, dashing at me or wheeling around my head, coming so\r\nclose that I could hear the _susurrus_ of their wings as well as the\r\nsharp, challenging buzz from their throats.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would interest you to know where the rambler found these tiny\r\nhummers. They were never in the dark cañons and gorges, nor in the\r\nravines that were heavily wooded with pine, but in the open, sunshiny\r\nglades and valleys, where there were green grass and bright flowers. In\r\nthe upper part of both North and South Cheyenne Cañons they were\r\nplentiful, although they avoided the most scenic parts of these\r\nwonderful mountain gorges. Another place where they found a pleasant\r\nsummer home was in a green pocket of the mountain above Red Cliff, a\r\nvillage on the western side of the great range. On descending the\r\nmountains to the town of Glenwood, I did not find them, and therefore am\r\ndisposed to think that in the breeding season they do not choose to\r\ndwell in too low or too high an altitude, but seek suitable places at an\r\nelevation of from seven thousand to nine thousand feet.\r\n\r\n_SUMMIT OF PIKE'S PEAK_\r\n\r\n_Only a small portion of the peak is shown in the view. The\r\ncomparatively level area referred to in the text lies back of the signal\r\nstation on the crest. At a garbage heap near the building a flock of\r\nleucostictes were seen, and the writer was told that they came there\r\nregularly to feed. From this sublime height the American pipits rise on\r\nresilient wings hundreds of feet into the air until they disappear in\r\nthe cerulean depths of the sky, singing all the while at \"heaven's\r\ngate.\"_\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne day, while staying at Buena Vista, Colorado, I hired a saddle-horse\r\nand rode to Cottonwood Lake, twelve miles away, among the rugged\r\nmountains. The valley is wide enough here to admit of a good deal of\r\nsunshine, and therefore flowers studded the ground in places. It was\r\nhere I saw the only female broad-tailed hummer that was met with in my\r\nrambles in the Rockies. She was flitting among the flowers, and did not\r\nmake the buzzing sound that the males produce wherever found. She was\r\nnot clad so elegantly as were her masculine relatives, for the\r\nthroat-patch was white instead of purple, and the green on her back did\r\nnot gleam so brightly. But, oddly enough, her sides and under\r\ntail-coverts were stained with a rufous tint--a color that does not\r\nappear at all in the costume of the male.\r\n\r\nA curious habit of these hummers is worth describing. The males remain\r\nin the breeding haunts until the young are out of the nest and are\r\nbeginning to be able to shift for themselves. Then the papas begin to\r\ndisappear, and in about ten days all have gone, leaving the mothers and\r\nthe youngsters to tarry about the summer home until the latter are\r\nstrong enough to make the journey to some resort lower in the mountains\r\nor farther south. The reason the males do this is perhaps evident\r\nenough, for at a certain date the flowers upon whose sweets the birds\r\nlargely subsist begin to grow scant, and so if they remained there\r\nwould not be enough for all.\r\n\r\nIn the San Francisco Mountains of Arizona, Doctor Merriam found the\r\nbroad-tails very abundant in the balsam timber and the upper part of the\r\npine belt, where they breed in the latter part of July; after which they\r\nremain in that region until the middle of September, even though the\r\nweather often becomes quite frosty at night. At break of day, in spite\r\nof the cold, they will gather in large flocks at some spring to drink\r\nand bathe. Doctor Merriam says about them at such times:\r\n\r\n    \"They were like swarms of bees, buzzing about one's head and darting\r\n    to and fro in every direction. The air was full of them. They would\r\n    drop down to the water, dip their feet and bellies, and rise and\r\n    shoot away as if propelled by an unseen power. They would often dart\r\n    at the face of an intruder as if bent on piercing the eye with their\r\n    needle-like bills, and then poise for a moment almost within reach\r\n    before turning, when they were again lost in the busy throng.\r\n    Whether this act was prompted by curiosity or resentment I was not\r\n    able to ascertain.\"\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, there is not always unruffled peace in the\r\nhummer family. Among the Rocky Mountains, and especially on the western\r\nside of the range, there dwells another little hummer called the rufous\r\nhumming-bird, because the prevailing color of his plumage is reddish,\r\nand between this family and the broad-tails there exists a bitter feud.\r\nWhen, in the migrating season, a large number of both species gather\r\ntogether in a locality where there is a cluster of wild-flowers, the\r\npicture they make as they dart to and fro and bicker and fight for some\r\nchoice blossom, their metallic colors flashing in the sun, is so\r\nbrilliant as never to be forgotten by the spectator who is fortunate\r\nenough to witness it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Pike's Peak in cloudland_\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER THE DIVIDE AND BACK\r\n\r\n\r\nOne June day a Denver & Rio Grande train bore the bird-lover from\r\nColorado Springs to Pueblo, thence westward to the mountains, up the\r\nGrand Cañon of the Arkansas River, through the Royal Gorge, past the\r\nsmiling, sunshiny upper mountain valleys, over the Divide at Tennessee\r\nPass, and then down the western slopes to the next stopping-place, which\r\nwas Red Cliff, a village nestling in a deep mountain ravine at the\r\njunction of Eagle River and Turkey Creek. The following day, a little\r\nafter \"peep o' dawn,\" I was out on the street, and was impressed by a\r\nsong coming from the trees on the acclivity above the village. \"Surely\r\nthat is a new song,\" I said to myself; \"and yet it seems to have a\r\nfamiliar air.\" A few minutes of hard climbing brought me near enough to\r\nget my glass on the little lyrist, and then I found it was only the\r\nhouse-wren! \"How could you be led astray by so familiar a song?\" you\r\ninquire. Well, that is the humiliating part of the incident, for I have\r\nbeen listening to the house-wren's gurgling sonata for some twenty\r\nyears--rather more than less--and should have recognized it at once;\r\nonly it must be remembered that I was in a strange place, and had my\r\nears and eyes set for avian rarities, and therefore blundered.[5]\r\n\r\n    [5] On this incident I quote a personal note from my friend, Mr.\r\n    Aiken: \"The wren of the Rockies is the western house-wren, but is\r\n    the same form as that found in the Mississippi Valley. It is quite\r\n    possible that a difference in song may occur, but I have not noticed\r\n    any.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cliff-Swallows_\r\n\r\n\"_On the rugged face of a cliff_\"]\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I found many birds on those steep mountain sides, which\r\nwere quite well timbered. Above the village a colony of cliff-swallows\r\nhad a nesting place on the rugged face of a cliff, and were soaring\r\nabout catching insects and attending to the wants of their greedy young.\r\n\r\nBesides the species named, I here found warbling vireos, broad-tailed\r\nhumming-birds, western nighthawks, ruby-crowned kinglets, magpies,\r\nsummer warblers, mountain chickadees, western wood-pewees, Louisiana\r\ntanagers, long-crested jays, kingfishers, gray-headed juncos,\r\nred-shafted flickers, pygmy nuthatches, house-finches, mountain jays,\r\nand Clarke's nutcrackers. The only species noted here that had not\r\npreviously been seen east of the Divide was the pygmy nuthatch, a little\r\nbird which scales the trunks and branches of trees like all his family,\r\nbut which is restricted to the Rocky Mountains. Like the white-breasted\r\nnuthatch, he utters an alto call, \"Yang! yang! yang!\" only it is soft\r\nand low--a miniature edition of the call of its eastern relative.\r\n\r\nA mountain chickadee's nest was also found, and here I heard for the\r\nfirst time one of these birds sing. Its performance was quite an\r\naffecting little minor whistle, usually composed of four distinct notes,\r\nthough sometimes the vocalist contented himself with a song of two or\r\nthree syllables. The ordinary run might be represented phonetically in\r\nthis way, \"Phee, ph-e-e-e, phe-phe,\" with the chief emphasis on the\r\nsecond syllable, which is considerably prolonged. The song is quite\r\ndifferent from that of the black-capped chickadee both in the intoning\r\nand the technical arrangement, while it does not run so high in the\r\nscale, nor does it impress me as being quite so much of a minor strain,\r\nif such a distinction can be made in music. Both birds' tunes, however,\r\nhave the character of being whistled.\r\n\r\nGlenwood is a charming summer resort in Colorado on the western side of\r\nthe Rocky Mountain range, and can be reached by both the Denver & Rio\r\nGrande and the Colorado Midland Railways. Beautifully situated in an\r\nopen mountain valley, it possesses many attractions in the way of\r\nnatural scenery, while the cool breezes blow down from the snow-mantled\r\nranges gleaming in the distance, and the medicinal springs draw many\r\ntourists in search of health and recuperation.\r\n\r\nMy purpose, however, in visiting this idyllic spot--I went there from\r\nRed Cliff--was not primarily to view the scenery, nor to make use of the\r\nhealing waters, but to gratify my thirst for bird-lore. Having spent\r\nsome weeks in observing the avi-fauna east of the range, I had a\r\ncuriosity to know something of bird life west of the great chain of\r\nalpine heights, and therefore I selected Glenwood as a fertile field in\r\nwhich to carry on some investigations. While my stay at this resort was\r\nall too short, it was of sufficient length to put me in possession of a\r\nnumber of facts that may prove to be of general interest.\r\n\r\nFor one thing I learned, somewhat to my surprise, that the avian fauna\r\non both sides of the Divide is much the same. Indeed, with one\r\nexception--to be noted more at length hereafter--I found no birds on\r\nthe western side that I had not previously seen on the eastern side,\r\nalthough a longer and minuter examination would undoubtedly have\r\nresulted in the discovery of a few species that are peculiar to the\r\nregions beyond the range. In the extreme western and southwestern\r\nportions of Colorado there are quite a number of species that are seldom\r\nor never seen in the eastern part of the State. However, keeping to the\r\nmountainous districts, and given the same altitude and other conditions,\r\nyou will be likely to find the same kinds of feathered folk on both\r\nsides of the range. A few concrete cases will make this statement clear.\r\nThe elevation of Glenwood is five thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight\r\nfeet; that of Colorado Springs, five thousand nine hundred and\r\nninety-two feet; and the climatic conditions otherwise are practically\r\nthe same. Hence at both places the following species were found: Lazuli\r\nbuntings, Arkansas goldfinches, American goldfinches, western\r\nwood-pewees, Arkansas kingbirds, Bullock's orioles, grassfinches, and\r\ncatbirds. At the same time there were a number of species in both\r\nlocalities that have a more extensive vertical range, as, for example,\r\nthe western robins, which were seen in many places from the bases of the\r\nmountains up to the timber-line, over eleven thousand five hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level.\r\n\r\n_ROYAL GORGE_\r\n\r\n_In the Grand Cañon of the Arkansas River. In cañons like this, their\r\nwalls rising almost vertically from one thousand to fifteen hundred\r\nfeet, few birds are to be seen. Occasionally a dove will fly from one\r\nside of the gorge to the other before the scurrying train. From below a\r\nmagpie or a Clark's crow may sometimes be seen flying overhead across\r\nthe fearful chasm from one wall to the other, turning its head at\r\nintervals as if to inspect and question the spectator over a thousand\r\nfeet below._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe presence of practically the same avian fauna on both sides of the\r\ngreat range suggests some speculations as to their movements in the\r\nmigrating season. Do those on the western side of the mountains travel\r\nover the towering summits from the eastern plains? Or do they come up\r\nfrom their southern winter homes by way of the valleys and plains west\r\nof the range? Undoubtedly the latter is the correct surmise, for there\r\nwere birds at Glenwood that are never known to ascend far into the\r\nmountains, and should they attempt to cross the Divide in the early\r\nspring, they would surely perish in the intense cold of those elevated\r\nregions, where snow often falls even in June, July, and August. One can\r\neasily imagine some of the eastern and western residents meeting in the\r\nautumn on the plains at the southern extremity of the mountain range,\r\ndwelling together in some southern locality throughout the winter, and\r\nthen, when spring approaches, taking their separate routes, part going\r\neast and part west of the range, for their breeding haunts in the North.\r\nMore than likely they do not meet again until the following autumn.\r\nThere are individuals, doubtless, that never catch a glimpse of the\r\nwestern side of the great American watershed, while others are deprived\r\nof the privilege of looking upon the majestic panoramas of the eastern\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said applies, of course, only to those species that\r\nprefer to dwell in the lower altitudes. There are other species that\r\nfind habitats to their taste in the most elevated localities, ranging\r\nat will in the summer time over the bald summits in the regions of\r\nperpetual snow. Among these may be mentioned the brown-capped\r\nleucostictes, the American pipits, the ravens, and Brewer's blackbirds.\r\nThese species will often have the privilege of looking upon the scenery\r\non both sides of the range, and you and I can scarcely repress a feeling\r\nof envy when we think of their happy freedom, and their frequent\r\nopportunities to go sightseeing.\r\n\r\nWhile taking an early morning stroll along one of the streets of\r\nGlenwood, I caught sight of a new member of the phoebe family, its\r\nreddish breast and sides differentiating it from the familiar phoebe\r\nof the East. Afterwards I identified it as Say's phoebe, a distinctly\r\nwestern species. Its habits are like those of its eastern relative. A\r\npair of Say's phoebes had placed their nest on a beam of a veranda,\r\nnear the roof, where they could be seen carrying food to their young. My\r\nnotes say nothing of their singing a tune or even uttering a chirp. This\r\nwas my first observation of Say's phoebe, although, as will be seen, I\r\nsubsequently saw one under somewhat peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\nHaving spent all the time I could spare at Glenwood, one morning I\r\nboarded the eastward-bound train, and was soon whirling up through the\r\nsublime cañons of Grand and Eagle Rivers, keeping on the alert for such\r\nbirds as I could see from the car-window. Few birds, as has been said,\r\ncan be seen in the dark gorges of the mountains, the species that are\r\nmost frequently descried being the turtle doves, with now and then a\r\nsmall flock of blackbirds. The open, sunlit valleys of the upper\r\nmountains, watered by the brawling streams, are much more to the liking\r\nof many birds, especially the mountain song-sparrows, the white-crowned\r\nsparrows, the green-tailed towhees, and Audubon's and Wilson's warblers.\r\nUp, up, for many miles the double-headed train crept, tooting and\r\npuffing hard, until at length it reached the highest point on the route,\r\nwhich is Tennessee Pass, through the tunnel of which it swept with a\r\nsullen roar, issuing into daylight on the eastern side, where the waters\r\nof the streams flow eastward instead of westward. The elevation of this\r\ntunnel is ten thousand four hundred and eighteen feet, which is still\r\nabout a thousand feet below the timber-line. A minute after emerging\r\nfrom the tunnel's mouth I caught sight of a red-shafted flicker which\r\nwent bolting across the narrow valley. The train swept down the valley\r\nfor some miles, stopped long enough to have another engine coupled to\r\nthe one that had brought us down from the tunnel, then wheeled to the\r\nleft and began the ascent to the city of Leadville. This city is\r\nsituated on a sloping plain on the mountain side, in full view of many\r\nbald mountain peaks whose gorges are filled with deep snow-drifts\r\nthroughout the summer. For some purposes Leadville may be an exceedingly\r\ndesirable city, but it has few attractions for the ornithologist. I took\r\na long walk through a part of the city, and, whether you will believe it\r\nor not, I did not see a single bird outside of a cage, not even a\r\nhouse-finch or an English sparrow, nor did I see one tree in my entire\r\nstroll along the busy streets. The caged birds seen were a canary and a\r\ncardinal, and, oddly enough, both of them were singing, mayhap for very\r\nhomesickness.\r\n\r\nWhy should a bird student tarry here? What was there to keep him in a\r\nbirdless place like this? I decided to leave at once, and so, checking\r\nmy baggage through to Buena Vista, I started afoot down the mountain\r\nside, determined to walk to Malta, a station five miles below, observing\r\nthe birds along the way. Not a feathered lilter was seen until I had\r\ngone about a mile from Leadville, when a disconsolate robin appeared\r\namong some scraggy pine bushes, not uttering so much as a chirp by way\r\nof greeting.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later I heard a vigorous and musical chirping in the pine\r\nbushes, and, turning aside, found a flock of small, finch-like birds.\r\nThey flitted about so rapidly that it was impossible to get a good view\r\nof them with my glasses; but such glimpses as I obtained revealed a\r\nprevailing grayish, streaked with some darker color, while a glint of\r\nyellow in their wings and tails was displayed as the birds flew from\r\nbush to bush. When the wings were spread, a narrow bar of yellow or\r\nwhitish-yellow seemed to stretch across them lengthwise, giving them a\r\ngauzy appearance. The birds remained together in a more or less compact\r\nflock. They uttered a loud, clear chirp that was almost musical, and\r\nalso piped a quaint trill that was almost as low and harsh as that of\r\nthe little clay-colored sparrow, although occasionally one would lift\r\nhis voice to a much higher pitch. What were these tenants of the dry and\r\npiney mountain side? They were pine siskins, which I had ample\r\nopportunity to study in my rambles among the mountains in 1901.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pine Siskins_]\r\n\r\nA mile farther down, a lone mountain bluebird appeared in sight, perched\r\non a gray stump on the gray hillside, and keeping as silent as if it\r\nwere a crime in bluebird-land to utter a sound. This bird's breeding\r\nrange extends from the plains to the timber-line; and he dwells on both\r\nsides of the mountains, for I met with him at Glenwood. About a half\r\nmile above Malta a western nighthawk was seen, hurtling in his\r\neccentric, zigzag flight overhead, uttering his strident call, and\r\n\"hawking for flies,\" as White of Selborne would phrase it. A western\r\ngrassfinch flew over to some bushes with a morsel in its bill, but I\r\ncould not discover its nest or young, search as I would. Afterwards it\r\nperched on a telegraph wire and poured out its evening voluntary, which\r\nwas the precise duplicate of the trills of the grassfinches of eastern\r\nNorth America. There seems to be only a slight difference between the\r\neastern and western forms of these birds, so slight, indeed, that they\r\ncan be distinguished only by having the birds in hand.\r\n\r\nTurtle doves were also plentiful in the valley above Malta, as they were\r\nin most suitable localities. Here were also several western robins, one\r\nof which saluted me with a cheerful carol, whose tone and syllabling\r\nwere exactly like those of the merry redbreast of our Eastern States. I\r\nwas delighted to find the sweet-voiced white-crowned sparrows tenants of\r\nthis valley, although they were not so abundant here as they had been a\r\nlittle over a week before in the hollows below the summit of Pike's\r\nPeak. But what was the bird which was singing so blithely a short\r\ndistance up the slope? He remained hidden until I drew near, when he\r\nran off on the ground like a frightened doe, and was soon ensconced in a\r\nsage bush. Note his chestnut crest and greenish back. This is the\r\ngreen-tailed towhee. He is one of the finest vocalists of the Rocky\r\nMountains, his tones being strong and well modulated, his execution\r\nalmost perfect as to technique, and his entire song characterized by a\r\nquality that might be defined as human expressiveness.\r\n\r\nA pair of western chipping sparrows were feeding their young in one of\r\nthe sage bushes. I hoped to find a nest, but my quest simply proved that\r\nthe bantlings had already left their nurseries. It was some\r\nsatisfaction, however, to establish the fact at first hand that the\r\nwestern chipping sparrows breed at an elevation of nine thousand five\r\nhundred and eighty feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\nWhile strolling about a short distance above the town, I discovered an\r\nunderground passage leading to some of the factories, or perhaps the\r\nsmelting works, a few miles farther up the valley. The over-arching\r\nground and timbers forming the roof were broken through at various\r\nplaces, making convenient openings for the unwary pedestrian to tumble\r\nthrough should he venture to stroll about here by night. Suddenly a\r\nlittle broad-shouldered bird appeared from some mysterious quarter, and\r\nflitted silently about from bush to bush or from one tussock of grass to\r\nanother. To my surprise, he presently dropped into one of the openings\r\nof the subterranean passage, disappeared for a few moments, and then\r\nemerged from another opening a little farther away. The bird--let me say\r\nat once--was Say's phoebe, with which, as previously told, I made\r\nacquaintance at Glenwood. He may be recognized by the reddish or\r\ncinnamon-brown cast of his abdomen and sides. Again and again he darted\r\ninto the passage, perhaps to make sure that his bairns had not been\r\nkidnapped, and then came up to keep a vigilant eye on his visitor, whom\r\nhe was not wholly disposed to trust. I am not sure that there was a nest\r\nin the subterranean passage, as my time was too short to look for it.\r\nOthers may not regard it as an important ornithological discovery, and I\r\ndo not pretend that it was epoch-making, but to me it was at least\r\ninteresting to find this species, which was new to me, dwelling at an\r\nelevation of five thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight feet on the\r\nwestern side of the range, and on the eastern side at an elevation of\r\nnine thousand five hundred and eighty feet. Nowhere else in my\r\nperegrinations among the Rockies did I so much as catch a glimpse of\r\nSay's phoebe.[6]\r\n\r\n    [6] In 1901 this bird was seen by me in South Park, and its quaint\r\n    whistle was heard,--it says _Phe-by_, but its tone and expression\r\n    are different from those of its eastern relative. See the chapter\r\n    entitled \"Pleasant Outings.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of some swallows circling about in the air, I saw no\r\nother birds during my brief stay at Malta. I was sorely disappointed in\r\nnot being able to find accommodation at this place, for it had been my\r\nintention to remain here for the night, and walk the next day to a\r\nstation called Granite, some seventeen miles farther down the valley,\r\nmaking observations on bird life in the region by the way. To this day I\r\nregret that my calculations went \"agley\"; but I was told that\r\naccommodation was not to be secured at Malta \"for love or money,\" and so\r\nI shook the dust from my feet, and boarded an evening train for my next\r\nstopping-place, which was Buena Vista.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of this beautiful mountain town is seven thousand nine\r\nhundred and sixty-seven feet. It nestles amid cottonwood trees and green\r\nmeadows in a wide valley or park, and is flanked on the east by the\r\nrolling and roaring Arkansas River, while to the west the plain slopes\r\nup gradually to the foothills of the three towering college\r\npeaks,--Harvard, Yale, and Princeton,--crowned all the year with snow.\r\nAnd here were birds in plenty. Before daybreak the avian concert began\r\nwith the shrieking of the western wood-pewees--a vocal performance that\r\nthey, in their innocence, seriously mistake for melody--and continued\r\nuntil night had again settled on the vale. In this place I spent three\r\nor four days, giving myself up to my favorite study and pastime, and a\r\nlist of all the birds that I saw in the neighborhood would surprise the\r\nreader. However, a mere catalogue would be of slight interest, I\r\napprehend, and therefore mention will be made only of those species\r\nwhich I had not seen elsewhere, passing by such familiar feathered folk\r\nas the Arkansas goldfinches, catbirds, western meadow-larks, Brewer's\r\nblackbirds, house-finches, green-tailed towhees, magpies, long-crested\r\njays, summer warblers, and many others, begging their pardon, of course,\r\nfor paying them such scant courtesy.\r\n\r\nEarly on a bright morning I was following one of the streets of the\r\nvillage, when, on reaching the suburbs, I was greeted by a blithe,\r\ndulcet trill which could come from no other vocalist than the\r\nsong-sparrow. His tones and vocalization were precisely like those of\r\n_Melospiza fasciata_, to which I have so often listened in my native\r\nState of Ohio. It was a dulcet strain, and stirred memories half sad,\r\nhalf glad, of many a charming ramble about my eastern home when the\r\nsong-sparrows were the chief choralists in the outdoor opera festival.\r\nPeering into the bushes that fringed the gurgling mountain brook, I soon\r\ncaught sight of the little triller, and found that, so far as I could\r\ndistinguish them with my field-glass, his markings were just like those\r\nof his eastern relative--the same mottled breast, with the large dusky\r\nblotch in the centre.\r\n\r\nDelighted as I was with the bird's aria, I could not decide whether this\r\nwas the common song-sparrow or the mountain song-sparrow. Something\r\nover a week earlier I had seen what I took to be the mountain\r\nsong-sparrow in a green nook below the summit of Pike's Peak, and had\r\nnoted his trill as a rather shabby performance in comparison with the\r\ntinkling chansons of the song-sparrow of the East. Had I mistaken some\r\nother bird for the mountain song-sparrow? Or was the Buena Vista bird\r\nthe common song-sparrow which had gone entirely beyond its Colorado\r\nrange? Consulting Professor W. W. Cooke's list of Colorado birds, I\r\nfound that _Melospiza fasciata_ is marked \"migratory, rare,\" and has\r\nbeen known thus far only in the extreme eastern part of the State;\r\nwhereas _Melospiza fasciata montana_ is a summer resident, \"common\r\nthroughout the State in migration, and not uncommon as a breeder from\r\nthe plains to eight thousand feet.\"\r\n\r\nBut Professor Cooke fails to give a clue to the song of either variety,\r\nand therefore my little problem remains unsolved, as I could not think\r\nof taking the life of a dulcet-voiced bird merely to discover whether it\r\nshould have \"_montana_\" affixed to its scientific name or not. All I can\r\nsay is, if this soloist was a mountain song-sparrow, he reproduced\r\nexactly the trills of his half-brothers of the East.[7] On the morning\r\nof my departure from Buena Vista another song-sparrow sang his matins,\r\nin loud, clear tones among the bushes of a stream that flowed through\r\nthe town, ringing quite a number of changes in his tune, all of them\r\nfamiliar to my ear from long acquaintance with the eastern forms of the\r\n_Melospiza_ subfamily.\r\n\r\n    [7] The problem has since been solved, through the aid of Mr. Aiken.\r\n    The Buena Vista bird was _montana_, while the bird in the Pike's\r\n    Peak hollow was Lincoln's sparrow.\r\n\r\nHow well I recall a rainy afternoon during my stay at Buena Vista! The\r\nrain was not so much of a downpour as to drive me indoors, although it\r\nmade rambling in the bushes somewhat unpleasant. What was this haunting\r\nsong that rose from a thick copse fringing one of the babbling mountain\r\nbrooks? It mingled sweetly with the patter of the rain upon the leaves.\r\nSurely it was the song of the veery thrush! The same rich, melodious\r\nstrain, sounding as if it were blown through a wind-harp, setting all\r\nthe strings a-tune at the same time. Too long and closely had I studied\r\nthe veery's minstrelsy in his summer haunts in northern Minnesota to be\r\ndeceived now--unless, indeed, this fertile avian region produced another\r\nthrush which whistled precisely the same tune. The bird's alarm-call was\r\nalso like that of the veery. The few glimpses he permitted of his\r\nflitting, shadowy form convinced me that he must be a veery, and so I\r\nentered him in my note-book.\r\n\r\nBut on looking up the matter--for the bird student must aim at\r\naccuracy--what was my surprise to find that the Colorado ornithologists\r\nhave decided that the veery thrush is not a resident of the State, nor\r\neven an occasional visitor! Of course I could not set up my judgment\r\nagainst that of those scientific gentlemen. But what could this minstrel\r\nbe? I wrote to my friend, Mr. Charles E. Aiken, of Colorado Springs, who\r\nreplied that the bird was undoubtedly the willow thrush, which is the\r\nwestern representative of the veery. I am willing to abide by this\r\ndecision, especially as Ridgway indicates in his Manual that there is\r\nvery little difference in the coloration of the two varieties. One more\r\nmile-post had been passed in my never-ending ornithological journey--I\r\nhad learned for myself and others that the willow thrush of the Rockies\r\nand the veery of our Eastern and Middle States have practically the same\r\nmusical repertory, and nowhere in the East or the West is sweeter and\r\nmore haunting avian minstrelsy to be heard, if only it did not give one\r\nthat sad feeling which Heine calls _Heimweh_!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Willow Thrush_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROCKY MOUNTAIN LAKE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\nLARK BUNTING--_Calamospiza melanocorys_\r\n(Upper figure, male; lower, female)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will find a small lake just about a mile from town. Follow the road\r\nleading out this way\"--indicating the direction--\"until you come to a\r\nred gate. The lake is private property, but you can go right in, as you\r\ndon't shoot. No one will drive you out. I think you will find it an\r\ninteresting place for bird study.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brewer's Blackbirds_\r\n\r\n\"_An interesting place for bird study_\"]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is what my landlord told me one morning at Buena Vista.\r\nNor did I waste time in finding the way to the lake, a small sheet of\r\nwater, as clear as crystal, embowered in the lovely park lying between\r\ntowering, snow-clad mountains. One might almost call the spot a bird's\r\nArcadia. In no place, in all my tramping among the Rockies, did I find\r\nso many birds in an equal area.\r\n\r\nIn the green, irrigated meadow bordering one side of the sheet of water,\r\nI was pleased to find a number of Brewer's blackbirds busily gathering\r\nfood in the wet grass for their young. And who or what are Brewer's\r\nblackbirds? In the East, the purple and bronzed grackles, or crow\r\nblackbirds, are found in great abundance; but in Colorado these birds\r\nare replaced by Brewer's blackbirds, which closely resemble their\r\neastern kinsfolk, although not quite so large. The iridescence of the\r\nplumage is somewhat different in the two species, but in both the golden\r\neye-balls show white at a distance. When I first saw a couple of\r\nBrewer's blackbirds stalking featly about on a lawn at Manitou, digging\r\nworms and grubs out of the sod, I simply put them down in my note-book\r\nas bronzed or purple grackles--an error that had to be corrected\r\nafterwards, on more careful examination. The mistake shows how close is\r\nthe resemblance between the two species.\r\n\r\nThe Brewer division of the family breed on the plains and in the\r\nmountains, to an altitude of ten thousand feet, always selecting marshy\r\nplaces for their early summer home; then in August and September, the\r\nbreeding season over, large flocks of old and young ascend to the\r\nregions above the timber-line, about thirteen thousand feet above\r\nsea-level, where they swarm over the grassy but treeless mountain sides\r\nin search of food. In October they retire to the plains, in advance of\r\nthe austere weather of the great altitudes, and soon the majority of\r\nthem hie to a blander climate than Colorado affords in winter.\r\n\r\nStill more interesting to me was the large colony of yellow-headed\r\nblackbirds that had taken up their residence in the rushes and flags of\r\nthe upper end of the lake. These birds are not such exclusive westerners\r\nas their ebon-hued cousins just described; for I found them breeding at\r\nLake Minnetonka, near Minneapolis, Minnesota, a few years ago, and they\r\nsometimes straggle, I believe, as far east as Ohio. A most beautiful\r\nbird is this member of the _Icteridæ_ family, a kind of Beau Brummel\r\namong his fellows, with his glossy black coat and rich yellow--and even\r\norange, in highest feather--mantle covering the whole head, neck, and\r\nbreast, and a large white, decorative spot on the wings, showing plainly\r\nin flight. He is the handsomest blackbird with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit to the lake, the latter part of June, the\r\nyellow-heads were busy feeding their young, many of which had already\r\nleft the nest. From the shore, I could see dozens of them clinging to\r\nthe reeds, several of which they would grasp with the claws of each\r\nfoot, their little legs straddled far apart, the flexile rushes\r\nspreading out beneath their weight. There the youngsters perched,\r\nwithout seeming to feel any discomfort from their strained position. And\r\nwhat a racket they made when the parent birds returned from an excursion\r\nto distant meadows and lawns, with bill-some tidbits! They were\r\ncertainly a hungry lot of bairns. When I waded out into the shallow\r\nwater toward their rushy home, the old birds became quite uneasy,\r\ncircling about above me like the red-wings, and uttering a harsh\r\nblackbird \"chack,\" varied at intervals by a loud, and not unmusical,\r\nchirp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Yellow-Headed Blackbirds_\r\n\r\n\"_There the youngsters perched_\"]\r\n\r\nYou should see the nest of the yellow-head. It is really a fine\r\nstructure, showing no small amount of artistic skill--a plaited cup,\r\nlooking almost as if it had been woven by human hands, the rushes of the\r\nrim and sides folding the supporting reeds in their loops. Thus the nest\r\nand its reedy pillars are firmly bound together. I waded out to a clump\r\nof rushes and found one nest with three eggs in its softly felted\r\ncup--the promise, no doubt, of a belated, or possibly a second, brood.\r\n\r\nThis mountain lake was also the abode of a number of species of ducks,\r\nnot all of which could be identified, on account of the distance they\r\nconstantly put between themselves and the observer. Flocks of them\r\nfloated like light, feathered craft upon the silvery bosom of the lake,\r\nnow pursuing one another, now drifting lazily, now diving, and anon\r\nplaying many attractive gambols.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious ducks I have ever seen was the ruddy duck,\r\ncalled in the scientific manuals _Erismatura rubida_. As I sat on a rock\r\non the shore, watching the aquatic fowl, one of the male ruddy ducks,\r\naccompanied by three or four females, swam out from the reeds into an\r\nopen space where I could see him plainly with my field-glass. A\r\nbeautiful picture he presented, as he glided proudly about on the water,\r\nsurrounded by his devoted harem. Imagine, if you can, how regal he must\r\nhave appeared--his broad, flat bill, light blue, widening out at the\r\ncommissure, and seeming to shade off into the large white cheeks, which\r\nlooked like snowy puffballs on the sides of his head; his crown, black\r\nand tapering; his neck, back, and sides, a rich, glossy brownish-red;\r\nhis lower parts, \"silky, silvery white, 'watered' with dusky, yielding,\r\ngray undulations\"; and his wing-coverts and jauntily perked-up tail,\r\nblack. If that was not a picture worthy of an artist's brush I have\r\nnever seen one in the outdoor world.\r\n\r\nNo less quaint was his conduct. That he was proud and self-conscious, no\r\none seeing him could doubt; and it was just as plain from his\r\nconsequential mien, that he was posing before his train of plainly clad\r\nwives, who, no doubt, looked upon him as the greatest \"catch\" of the\r\nlake. Unlike most ducks, in swimming this haughty major carries his head\r\nerect, and even bent backward at a sharp angle; and his short tail is\r\ncocked up and bent forward, so that his glossy back forms a graceful\r\nhalf-circle or more, and does not slope downward, as do the backs of\r\nmost ducks on the water.\r\n\r\nOf all the odd gestures, this fellow's carried off the palm. He would\r\ndraw his head up and back, then thrust it forward a few inches, extend\r\nhis blue bill in a horizontal line, and at the same time emit a low,\r\ncoarse squawk that I could barely hear. Oddly enough, all the females,\r\nstaid as they were, imitated their liege lord's deportment. It was their\r\nway of protesting against my ill-bred intrusion into their demesne.\r\n\r\nPresently a second male came out into the open space, accompanied by a\r\nretinue of wives, and then a third emerged, similarly attended. With\r\nthis there was a challenging among the rivals that was interesting to\r\nwitness; they fairly strutted about on the water, now advancing, now\r\nretreating, and occasionally almost, but never quite, closing in combat.\r\nSometimes one would pursue another for a rod or more, in a swift rush\r\nthat would make the spray fly and cut a swath on the smooth bosom of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nSeveral coots now appeared on the scene. Between them and the ruddy\r\nducks there seemed to be a feud of more or less intensity, each being on\r\nthe offensive or the defensive as the exigencies of naval warfare\r\ndemanded. Once I was moved to laughter as a coot made a fierce dash\r\ntoward one of the ducks, and was almost upon her, and I thought she was\r\ndestined to receive a severe trouncing, when she suddenly dodged her\r\npursuer by diving. He just as suddenly gave up the chase, looking as if\r\nit were a case of \"sour grapes,\" anyway.\r\n\r\nAfter watching the antics of these birds for a long time, I turned my\r\nattention to another pretty scene,--a pair of coots leading their family\r\nof eight or ten little ones out into the clear area from their\r\nhiding-place among the reeds, presenting a picture of unruffled domestic\r\nbliss. How sweet and innocent the little coots were! Instead of the\r\nblack heads and necks of their parents, and the white bills and frontal\r\nbones, these parts were tinted with red, which appeared quite bright and\r\ngauze-like in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe process of feeding the juvenile birds was interesting. The parents\r\nwould swim about, then suddenly dip their heads into the water, or else\r\ndive clear under, coming up with slugs in their bills. Turning to the\r\nyoungsters, which were always close upon their heels--or perhaps I\r\nwould better say their tails--they would hold out their bills, when the\r\nlittle ones would swim up and pick off the toothsome morsel. It must not\r\nbe supposed that the bantlings opened their mouths, as most young birds\r\ndo, to receive the tidbits. No, indeed! That is not coot vogue. The\r\nlittle ones picked the insects from the sides of the papa's or mamma's\r\nbeak, turning their own little heads cunningly to one side as they\r\nhelped themselves to their luncheon.\r\n\r\nThe other waterfowl of the lake acted in an ordinary way, and therefore\r\nneed no description. It was strange, however, that this was the only\r\nlake seen in all my Rocky Mountain touring where I found waterfowl. At\r\nSeven Lakes, Moraine Lake, and others in the vicinity of Pike's Peak,\r\nnot a duck, crane, or coot was to be seen; and the same was true of\r\nCottonwood Lake, twelve miles from Buena Vista, right in the heart of\r\nthe rugged mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_From their place among the reeds_\"]\r\n\r\nTwo facts may account for the abundance of birds at the little lake near\r\nBuena Vista; first, here they were protected from gunners and pot\r\nhunters by the owner, whose residence commanded a full view of the whole\r\narea; and, second, large spaces of the upper end of the lake was thickly\r\ngrown with flags and rushes, which were cut off from the shore by a\r\nwatery space of considerable breadth. In this place these birds found\r\ncoverts from enemies and suitable sites for their nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BIRD MISCELLANY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shall be my purpose in this chapter to describe with more or less\r\nfulness a number of Rocky Mountain birds which have either not been\r\nmentioned in previous chapters or have received only casual attention.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Colorado one is surprised to find none of our common blue\r\njays which are so abundant in the Eastern and Middle States. In my\r\nnumerous Rocky Mountain jaunts not one was seen. Yet this region does\r\nnot need to go begging for jays, only they belong to different groups of\r\nthe _Garrulinæ_ subfamily. The most abundant and conspicuous of these\r\nwestern forms are the long-crested jays, so called on account of the\r\nlong tuft of black feathers adorning the occiput. This distinguishing\r\nmark is not like the firm pyramidal crest of the eastern jay, but is\r\nlonger and narrower, and so flexible that it sways back and forth as the\r\nbird flits from branch to branch or takes a hop-skip-and-jump over the\r\nground. Its owner can raise and lower it at will.\r\n\r\nThe forehead of this jay is prettily sprinkled with white; his head and\r\nneck are black, in decided contrast with the umber-brown of the back;\r\nhis rump and belly are pale blue, and his wings and tail are rich\r\nindigo-blue, somewhat iridescent and widely barred with black. Thus it\r\nwill be seen that he has quite a different costume from that of our\r\neastern jay, with his gaudy trimmings of white and black and purplish\r\nblue. The westerner cannot boast of _cristata's_ dressy black collar,\r\nbut otherwise he is more richly attired, although he may not be quite so\r\nshowy.\r\n\r\nThe long-crested jays have a wide range among the mountains, breeding\r\nfrom the base of the foothills to the timber-line, although their nests\r\nare not commonly found below an altitude of seven thousand feet. In many\r\nplaces from nine to eleven thousand feet up the acclivities of the\r\nmountains they were seen flitting among the pines or the quaking asps.\r\nLike their eastern relatives, some individuals seem to prefer the\r\nsociety of man, dwelling in the villages or in the vicinity of country\r\nhomes, while others choose the most secluded and solitary localities for\r\ntheir habitat. The fact is, I rarely made an excursion anywhere without\r\nsooner or later discovering that these jays had pre-empted the place for\r\nfeeding or breeding purposes, sometimes with loud objurgations bidding\r\nme be gone, and at other times making no to-do whatever over my\r\nintrusion. Perhaps the proximity or remoteness of their nests was the\r\nchief cause of this variableness in their behavior.\r\n\r\nA pretty picture is one of these jays mounting from branch to branch\r\naround the stem of a pine tree, from the lower limbs to the top, as if\r\nhe were ascending a spiral staircase. This seems to be one of their\r\nregulation habits when they find themselves under inspection. If you\r\nintrude on their domestic precincts, their cry is quite harsh, and bears\r\nno resemblance to the quaint calls of the eastern jays; nor does the\r\nplaintive note of the eastern representative, so frequently heard in the\r\nautumnal woods, ever issue from any of the numerous jay throats of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to blacken the reputation of any bird, but there is at\r\nleast circumstantial evidence that the long-crested jay, like his\r\neastern cousin, is a nest robber; for such birds as robins, tanagers,\r\nflycatchers, and vireos make war upon him whenever he comes within their\r\nbreeding districts, and this would indicate that they are only too well\r\naware of his predatory habits. More than that, he has the sly and\r\nstealthy manners of the sneak-thief and the brigand. Of course, he is by\r\nno means an unmixed evil, for you will often see him leaping about on\r\nthe lawns, capturing beetles and worms which would surely be injurious\r\nto vegetation if allowed to live and multiply.\r\n\r\nThere are other jays in the Rockies that deserve attention. The Rocky\r\nMountain jay--_Perisoneus canadensis capitalis_--is a bird of the higher\r\naltitudes, remaining near the timber-line all the year round, braving\r\nthe most rigorous weather and the fiercest mountain storms during the\r\nwinter. Although not an attractive species, his hardiness invests him\r\nwith not a little interest. One can imagine him seeking a covert in the\r\ndense pineries when a storm sweeps down from the bald, snow-mantled\r\nsummits, squawking his disapproval of the ferocity of old Boreas, and\r\nyet able to resist his most violent onsets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Rocky Mountain Jay_\r\n\r\n\"_Seeking a covert in the dense pineries when a storm sweeps down from\r\nthe mountains_\"]\r\n\r\nEarly in April, at an altitude of from eight thousand to eleven thousand\r\nfive hundred feet, these jays begin to breed. At that height this is\r\nlong before the snow ceases to fall; indeed, on the twentieth of June,\r\nwhile making the descent from Pike's Peak, I was caught in a snowfall\r\nthat gave the ground quite a frosty aspect for a few minutes. One can\r\nreadily fancy, therefore, that the nests of these birds are often\r\nsurrounded with snow, and that the bantlings may get their first view\r\nof the world in the swirl of a snow-squall. The nests are built in pine\r\nbushes and trees at various distances from the ground. Of all the\r\nhurly-burlies ever heard, that which these birds are able to make when\r\nyou go near their nests, or discover them, bears off the palm, their\r\nvoices being as raucous as a buzz-saw, fairly setting your teeth on\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nThose of us who live in the East are so accustomed to the adjective\r\n\"blue\" in connection with the jay that we are surprised to find that _P.\r\nc. capitalis_ wears no blue whatever, but dons a sombre suit of leaden\r\ngray, somewhat relieved by the blackish shade of the wings and tail,\r\nwith their silvery or frosted lustre. He is certainly not an attractive\r\nbird, either in dress or in form, for he appears very \"thick-headed\" and\r\nlumpish, as if he scarcely knew enough to seek shelter in a time of\r\nstorm; but, of course, a bird that contrives to coax a livelihood out of\r\nsuch unpromising surroundings must possess a fine degree of\r\nintelligence, and, therefore, cannot be so much of a dullard as his\r\nappearance would indicate.\r\n\r\nHe has some interesting ways, too, as will be seen from the following\r\nquotation from a Colorado writer: \"White-headed, grave, and sedate, he\r\nseems a very paragon of propriety, and if you appear to be a suitable\r\npersonage, he will be apt to give you a bit of advice. Becoming\r\nconfidential, he sputters out a lot of nonsense which causes you to\r\nthink him a veritable 'whiskey Jack.' Yet, whenever he is disposed, a\r\nmore bland, mind-your-own-business appearing bird will be hard to find;\r\nas will also many small articles around camp after one of his visits,\r\nfor his whimsical brain has a great fancy for anything which may be\r\nvaluable to you, but perfectly useless to himself.\" This habit of\r\npurloining has won him the title of \"camp robber\" among the people of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse's jay, also peculiar to the Rocky Mountain region, is mostly\r\nto be found along the base of the foothills and the lower wooded\r\nmountains. While he may be called a \"blue\" jay, having more of that\r\ncolor in his plumage than even the long-crested, he belongs to the\r\n_Aphelcoma_ group--that is, he is without a crest.\r\n\r\nEvery observer of eastern feathered folk is familiar with our \"little\r\nboy blue,\" the indigo-bird, whose song is such a rollicking and saucy\r\nair, making you feel as if the little lyrist were chaffing you. In\r\nColorado, however, you do not meet this animated chunk of blue, but\r\nanother little bird that belongs to the same group, called the \"painted\r\nfinches,\" although their plumes are not painted any more than those of\r\nother species. This bird is the lazuli bunting. He wears a great deal of\r\nblue, but it is azure, and not indigo, covering the head, neck, most of\r\nthe upper parts, and the lining of the wings; and, as if to give\r\nvariety to the bird's attire, the nape and back are prettily shaded with\r\nbrown, and the wings and tail with black. But his plumage is still more\r\nvariegated, for he bears a conspicuous white spot on the greater\r\nwing-coverts, and his breast is daintily tinted with chestnut-brown,\r\nabruptly cut off from the blue of the throat, while the remaining under\r\nparts are snowy white. From this description it will be seen that he is\r\nquite unlike the indigo-bird, which has no brown or white in his\r\ncerulean attire. Handsome as Master Indigo is, the lazuli finch, with\r\nhis sextet of hues, is a more showily dressed bird; in fact, a lyric in\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the two birds are quite similar. However, the lazuli\r\nseemed to be much shyer than his relative, for the latter is a familiar\r\nfigure at the border of our eastern woodlands, about our country homes,\r\nand even in the neighborhood of our town dwellings, when there are\r\nbushes and trees close at hand. My saunterings among the mountains took\r\nme into the haunts of the lazulis, but I regret to have to confess that\r\nall my alertness was of so little avail that I saw only three males and\r\none female. One day, while rambling among the cottonwoods that broidered\r\nthe creek flowing south of Colorado Springs, I was brought to a\r\nstandstill by a sharp chirp, and the next moment a pair of lazulis\r\nappeared on the lower branches and twigs of a tree. There they sat quiet\r\nenough, watching me keenly, but allowing me to peer at them at will\r\nwith my field-glass. I could not understand why birds that otherwise\r\nwere so shy should now permit a prolonged inspection and manifest so\r\nlittle anxiety; but perhaps they reasoned that they had been discovered\r\nanyway, and there was no need of pretending that no lazulis dwelt in the\r\nneighborhood. How elegant the little husband looked in his variegated\r\nattire! The wife was soberly clad in warm brown, slightly streaked with\r\ndusk, but she was trig and pretty and worthy of her more richly\r\napparelled spouse. In the bushes below I found a well-made nest, which I\r\nfelt morally certain belonged to the little couple that was keeping such\r\nfaithful surveillance over it. As yet it contained no eggs.\r\n\r\nIn order to make certainty doubly sure, I visited the place a week or so\r\nlater, and found that my previous conclusion had been correct. I flushed\r\nthe little madame from the nest, and saw her flit with a chirp to the\r\ntwigs above, where she sat quietly watching her visitor, exhibiting no\r\nuneasiness whatever about her cot in the bushes with its three precious\r\neggs. It was pleasing to note the calmness and dignity with which she\r\nregarded me. But where was that important personage, the little husband?\r\nHe was nowhere to be seen, although I lingered about the charmed spot\r\nfor over two hours, hoping to get at least a glimpse of him. A friend,\r\nwho understands the sly ways of the lazulis, suggested that very likely\r\nthe male was watching me narrowly all the while from a safe hiding-place\r\nin the dense foliage of some tree not far away.\r\n\r\nMy friend told me that I would not be able to distinguish the song of\r\nthe lazuli from those of the summer and mountain warblers. We shall see\r\nwhether he was right. One evening I was searching for a couple of blue\r\ngrosbeaks at the border of Colorado Springs, where I had previously seen\r\nthem, when a loud, somewhat percussive song, much like the summer\r\nwarbler's, burst on my ear, coming from a clump of willow bushes hard by\r\nthe stream. At once I said to myself, \"That is not the summer warbler's\r\ntrill. It resembles the challenging song of the indigo-bird, only it is\r\nnot quite so loud and defiant. A lazuli finch's song, or I am sadly\r\nastray! Let me settle the question now.\"\r\n\r\nI did settle it to my great satisfaction, for, after no little effort, I\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a plain view of the elusive little lyrist, and,\r\nsure enough, it proved to be the lazuli finch. Metaphorically I patted\r\nmyself with a great deal of self-complacency, as I muttered: \"The idea\r\nof Mr. Aiken's thinking I had so little discrimination! I know that\r\nhereafter I shall be able to detect the lazuli's peculiar intonations\r\nevery time.\" So I walked home in a very self-confident frame of mind. A\r\nfew days later I heard another song lilting down from the upper branches\r\nof a small tree. \"Surely that is the lazuli again,\" I muttered. \"I know\r\nthat voice.\" For a while I eyed the tree, and presently caught sight of\r\nthe little triller, and behold, it was--a summer warbler! All my\r\nself-complacency vanished in a moment; I wasn't cock-sure of anything;\r\nand I am obliged to confess that I was led astray in a similar manner\r\nmore than once afterward. It may indicate an odd psychological condition\r\nto make the claim; but, absurd or not, I am disposed to believe that,\r\nwhenever I really heard the lazuli, I was able to recognize his song\r\nwith a fair degree of certainty, but when I heard the summer warbler I\r\nwas thrown into more or less confusion, not being quite sure whether it\r\nwas that bird or the other.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory lazuli song I heard was on the western side of the\r\nrange, at the resort called Glenwood. This time, as was usually the\r\ncase, I heard the little triller before seeing him, and was sure it was\r\n_Passerina amoena_, as the bunting strains were plainly discernible.\r\nHe was sitting on a telephone wire, and did not flit away as I stood\r\nbelow and peered at him through my glass, and admired his trig and\r\nhandsome form. I studied his song, and tried to fix the peculiar\r\nintonations in my mind, and felt positive that I could never be caught\r\nagain--but I was.[8]\r\n\r\n    [8] In the foregoing remarks the lazuli finches have been\r\n    represented as excessively shy. So they were in 1899 in the\r\n    neighborhoods then visited. Strangely enough, in the vicinity of\r\n    Denver in 1901, these birds were abundant and as easily approached\r\n    and studied as are the indigoes of the East. See the chapter\r\n    entitled, \"Plains and Foothills.\"\r\n\r\nThe lazuli finch does not venture very high into the mountains, seldom\r\nreaching an altitude of more than seven thousand feet. He is a lover of\r\nthe plains, the foothills, and the lower ranges of the mountains. In\r\nthis respect he differs from some other little birds, which seek a\r\nsummer home in the higher regions. On the southern slope of Pike's Peak,\r\na little below the timber-line, I found a dainty little bird which was a\r\nstranger to me. It was Audubon's warbler. At first sight I decided that\r\nhe must be the myrtle warbler, but was compelled to change my conclusion\r\nwhen I got a glimpse of his throat, which was golden yellow, whereas the\r\nthroat of _Dendroica coronata_ is pure white. Then, too, the myrtle\r\nwarbler is only a migrant in Colorado, passing farther north to breed.\r\nAudubon's, it must be said, has extremely rich habiliments, his upper\r\nparts being bluish-ash, streaked with black, his belly and under\r\ntail-coverts white, and his breast in high feather, black, prettily\r\nskirted with gray or invaded with white from below; but his yellow\r\nspots, set like gleaming gold in various parts of his plumage,\r\nconstitute his most marked embellishment, being found on the crown,\r\nrump, throat, and each side of the chest.\r\n\r\nOn my first excursion to some meadows and wooded low-grounds south of\r\nColorado Springs, while listening to a concert given by western\r\nmeadow-larks, my attention was attracted to a large, black bird circling\r\nabout the fields and then alighting on a fence-post. My first thought\r\nwas: \"It is only a crow blackbird.\" But on second thought I decided that\r\nthe crow blackbird did not soar and circle about in this manner. At all\r\nevents, there seemed to be something slightly peculiar about this bird's\r\nbehavior, so I went nearer to inspect him, when he left his perch on the\r\npost, flapped around over the meadow, and finally flew to a large,\r\npartially decayed cottonwood tree in a pasture field. If I could believe\r\nmy eyes, he clung to the upright stems of the branches after the style\r\nof a woodpecker! That was queer indeed--a woodpecker that looked\r\nprecisely like a blackbird! Such a featherland oddity was certainly\r\nforeign to any of my calculations; for, it must be remembered, this was\r\nprior to my making acquaintance with Williamson's sapsucker.\r\n\r\nCloser inspection proved that this bird was actually hitching up and\r\ndown the branches of the tree in the regular woodpecker fashion.\r\nPresently he slipped into a hole in a large limb, and the loud, eager\r\nchirping of young birds was heard. It was not long before his mate\r\nappeared, entered the cavity, and fed the clamorous brood. The birds\r\nproved to be Lewis's woodpeckers, another distinctly western type. My\r\nfield-glass soon clearly brought out their peculiar markings.\r\n\r\nA beautiful bird-skin, bought of Mr. Charles E. Aiken, now lies on my\r\ndesk and enables me to describe the fine habiliments of this kind from\r\nan actual specimen. His upper parts are glossy black, the sheen on the\r\nback being greenish, and that on the wings and tail bluish or purplish,\r\naccording to the angle of the sun's light; a white collar prettily\r\nencircles the neck, becoming quite narrow on the nape, but widening out\r\non the side so as to cover the entire breast and throat. This pectoral\r\nshield is mottled with black and lightly stained with buff in spots; the\r\nforehead, chin, superciliary line, and a broad space on the cheek are\r\ndyed a deep crimson; and, not least by any means, the abdomen is washed\r\nwith pink, which is delicately stencilled with white, gray, and buff. A\r\nmost gorgeous bird, fairly rivalling, but not distancing, Williamson's\r\nsapsucker.\r\n\r\nBy accident I made a little discovery relative to the claws of this\r\nwoodpecker which, I suppose, would be true of all the _Picidæ_ family.\r\nThe claws of the two fore toes are sharply curved and extremely acute,\r\nmaking genuine hooks, so that when I attempt to pass my finger over them\r\nthe points catch at the skin. Could a better hook be contrived for\r\nenabling the bird to clamber up the trunks and branches of trees? But\r\nnote: the claws of the two hind toes are not so sharply decurved, nor\r\nso acute at the points, the finger slipping readily over them. Who can\r\ndeny the evidence of design in nature? The fore claws are highly\r\nspecialized for clinging, the very purpose for which they are needed,\r\nwhile the hind claws, being used for a different purpose--only that of\r\nsupport--are moulded over a different pattern.\r\n\r\nLike our common red-head, this bird has the habit of soaring out into\r\nthe air and nabbing insects on the wing. The only other pair of these\r\nwoodpeckers I was so fortunate as to meet with were found in the ravine\r\nleading up from Buena Vista to Cottonwood Lake.[9] Their nest was in a\r\ndead tree by the roadside. While the first couple had been entirely\r\nsilent, one of the second pair chirped somewhat uneasily when I lingered\r\nbeneath his tree, suspecting, no doubt, that I had sinister designs upon\r\nhis nest. Unlike some of their kinsmen, these pickers of wood seem to be\r\nquiet and dignified, not given to much demonstration, and are quite\r\nleisurely in their movements both on the branch and on the wing.\r\n\r\n    [9] Two years later a pair were seen on a mountain near Golden,\r\n    Colorado, and probably twenty individuals were watched a long time\r\n    from a cañon above Boulder as they circled gracefully over the\r\n    mountains, catching insects on the wing.\r\n\r\nOne day, when walking up Ute Pass, celebrated both for its magnificent\r\nscenery and its Indian history, I first saw the water-ousel. I had been\r\ninspecting Rainbow Falls, and was duly impressed with its\r\nattractiveness. Thinking I had lingered long enough, I turned away and\r\nclambered up the rocky wall below the falls towards the road above. As I\r\ndid so, a loud, bell-like song rang above the roar of the water. On\r\nlooking down into the ravine, I saw a mouse-colored bird, a little\r\nsmaller than the robin, his tail perked up almost vertically, scuttling\r\nabout on the rocks below and dipping his body in an expressive way like\r\nthe \"tip-up\" sandpiper. Having read about this bird, I at once\r\nrecognized it as the water-ousel. My interest in everything else\r\nvanished. This was one of the birds I had made my pilgrimage to the\r\nRockies to study. It required only a few minutes to scramble down into\r\nthe ravine again.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly I watched the little bird. Its queer teetering is like that\r\nof some of the wrens, accentors, and water-thrushes. Now it ran to the\r\ntop of a rock and stood dipping and eying me narrowly, flirting its\r\nbobby tail; now it flew to one of the steep, almost vertical walls of\r\nrock and scrambled up to a protuberance; then down again to the water;\r\nthen, to my intense delight, it plunged into the limpid stream, and came\r\nup the next moment with a slug or water-beetle in its bill. Presently it\r\nflew over to the opposite wall, its feet slipping on the wet rocks, and\r\ndarted into a small crevice just below the foot of the falls, gave a\r\nquick poke with its beak and flitted away--minus the tidbit it had held\r\nin its bill.\r\n\r\n_RAINBOW FALLS_\r\n\r\n_When the sun strikes the spray and mist at the proper angle, a\r\nbeautiful rainbow is painted on the face of the falls. At the time of\r\nthe author's visit to this idyllic spot a pair of water-ousels had\r\nchosen it for a summer residence. They flew from the rocks below to the\r\ntop of the falls, hugging close to the rushing torrent. In returning,\r\nthey darted in one swift plunge from the top to the bottom, alighting on\r\nthe rocks below. With the utmost abandon they dived into the seething\r\nwaters at the foot of the falls, usually emerging with a slug or beetle\r\nin their bills for the nestlings. Shod with tall rubber boots, the\r\nwriter waded close up to the foot of the falls in search of the dipper's\r\nnest, which was set in a cleft of the rocks a few inches above the\r\nwater, in the little shadowed cavern at the left of the stream. The\r\npointed rock wrapped in mist, almost in the line of the plunging tide,\r\nwas a favorite perch for the dippers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAh! my propitious stars shone on me that day with special favor. I had\r\nfound not only the water-ousel itself, but also its nest. Suddenly\r\nwater-ousel number two, the mate of number one, appeared on the scene,\r\ndipped, scanned me closely, flew to the slippery wall, darted to the\r\ncranny, and deposited its morsel, as its spouse had done. This time I\r\nheard the chirping of the youngsters. Before examining the nest I\r\ndecided to watch the performances of the parent birds, which soon cast\r\noff all the restraint caused for a moment by my presence, taking me, no\r\ndoubt, for the ordinary sightseer who overlooks them altogether.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the birds plunged into the churning flood at the foot of\r\nthe falls, sometimes remaining under water what seemed a long while, and\r\nalways coming to the surface with a delicacy for the nestlings. They\r\nwere able to dip into the swift, white currents and wrestle with them\r\nwithout being washed away. Of course, the water would sometimes carry\r\nthem down stream, but never more than a few inches, and never to a point\r\nwhere they could be injured. They were perfect masters of the situation.\r\nThey simply slipped in and out like living chunks of cork. Their coats\r\nwere waterproof, all they needed to do being to shake off the crystal\r\ndrops now and then.\r\n\r\nTheir flight up the almost perpendicular face of the falls was one of\r\ngraceful celerity. Up, up, they would mount only a few inches from the\r\ndashing current, and disappear upstream in search of food. In returning,\r\nthey would sweep down over the precipitous falls with the swiftness of\r\narrows, stopping themselves lightly with their outspread wings before\r\nreaching the rocks below. From a human point of view it was a frightful\r\nplunge; from the ousel point of view it was an every-day affair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Water-Ousel_\r\n\r\n\"_Up, up, only a few inches from the dashing current_\"]\r\n\r\nAfter watching the tussle between ousel and water for a long time, I\r\ndecided to take a peep at their nursery. In order to do this I was\r\ncompelled to wade into the stream a little below the falls, through mist\r\nand spray; yet such humid quarters were the natural habitat and\r\nplayground of these interesting cinclids. And there the nest was, set in\r\na cleft about a foot and a half above the water, its outer walls kept\r\nmoist by the spray which constantly dashed against them from the falls.\r\nThe water was also dripping from the rock that over-hung the nest and\r\nformed its roof. A damp, uncanny place for a bird's domicile, you would\r\nnaturally suppose, but the little lovers of cascades knew what they were\r\nabout. Only the exterior of the thick, moss-covered walls were moist.\r\nWithin, the nest was dry and cosey. It was an oval structure, set in its\r\nrocky cleft like a small oven, with an opening at the front. And there\r\nin the doorway cuddled the two fledglings, looking out at the dripping\r\nwalls and the watery tumult, but kept warm and comfortable. I could not\r\nresist touching them and caressing their little heads, considering it\r\nquite an ornithological triumph for one day to find a pair of\r\nwater-ousels, discover a nest, and place my finger upon the crowns of\r\nthe nestlings.\r\n\r\nScores of tourists visited the famous falls every day, some of them\r\nlingering long in the beautiful place, and yet the little ousels had\r\ngone on with their nest-building and brood-rearing, undisturbed by human\r\nspectators. I wondered whether many of the visitors noticed the birds,\r\nand whether any one but myself had discovered their nest. Indeed, their\r\nlittle ones were safe enough from human meddling, for one could not see\r\nthe nest without wading up the stream into the sphere of the flying\r\nmists.\r\n\r\nThe natural home of _Cinclus mexicanus_ is the Rocky Mountains, to which\r\nhe is restricted, not being known anywhere else on this continent. He is\r\nthe only member of the dipper family in North America. There is one\r\nspecies in South America, and another in Europe. He loves the mountain\r\nstream, with its dashing rapids and cascades. Indeed, he will erect his\r\noven-like cottage nowhere else, and it must be a fall and not a mere\r\nripple or rapid. Then from this point as a centre--or, rather, the\r\nmiddle point of a wavering line--he forages up and down the babbling,\r\nmeandering brook, feeding chiefly, if not wholly, on water insects.\r\nStrange to say, he never leaves the streams, never makes excursions to\r\nthe country roundabout, never flies over a mountain ridge or divide to\r\nreach another valley, but simply pursues the winding streams with a\r\nfidelity that deserves praise for its very singleness of purpose. No\r\n\"landlubber\" he. It is said by one writer that the dipper has never been\r\nknown to alight on a tree, preferring a rock or a piece of driftwood\r\nbeside the babbling stream; yet he has the digits and claws of the\r\npasseres, among which he is placed systematically. He is indeed an\r\nanomaly, though a very engaging one. Should he wish to go to another\r\ncañon, he will simply follow the devious stream he is on to its junction\r\nwith the stream of the other valley; then up the second defile. His\r\nflight is exceedingly swift. His song is a loud, clear, cheerful strain,\r\nthe very quintessence of gladness as it mingles with the roar of the\r\ncataracts.\r\n\r\nFarther up Ute Pass I found another nest, which was placed right back\r\nof a cascade, so that the birds had to dash through a curtain of spray\r\nto reach their cot. They also were feeding their young, and I could see\r\nthem standing on a rock beneath the shelf, tilting their bodies and\r\nscanning me narrowly before diving into the cleft where the nest was\r\nhidden. This nest, being placed back of the falls, could not be reached.\r\n\r\nIn Bear Creek cañon I discovered another inaccessible nest, which was\r\nplaced in a fissure at the very foot of the falls and only an inch or\r\ntwo above the agitated waters. There must have been a cavity running\r\nback into the rock, else the nest would have been kept in a soggy\r\ncondition all the time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting dipper's nest I found was one at the\r\ncelebrated Seven Falls in the south Cheyenne Cañon. On the face of the\r\ncliff by the side of the lowest fall there was a cleft, in which the\r\nnest was placed, looking like a large bunch of moss and grass. My glass\r\nbrought the structure so near that I could plainly see three little\r\nheads protruding from the doorway. There were a dozen or more people\r\nabout the falls at the time, who made no attempt at being quiet, and yet\r\nthe parent birds flew fearlessly up to the nest with tidbits in their\r\nbills, and were greeted with loud, impatient cries from three hungry\r\nmouths, which were opened wide to receive the food. The total plunge of\r\nthe stream over the Seven Falls is hundreds of feet, and yet the adult\r\nbirds would toss themselves over the abyss with reckless abandon, stop\r\nthemselves without apparent effort in front of their cleft, and thrust\r\nthe gathered morsels into the little yellow-lined mouths. It was an\r\naerial feat that made our heads dizzy. This pair of birds did not fly up\r\nthe face of the falls in ascending to the top, as did those at Rainbow\r\nFalls, but clambered up the wall of the cliff close to the side of the\r\nroaring cataract, aiding themselves with both claws and wings. When\r\ngathering food below the falls, they would usually, in going or\r\nreturning, fly in a graceful curve over the heads of their human\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Water-Ousel_\r\n\r\n\"_Three hungry mouths, which were opened wide to receive the food_\"]\r\n\r\nAlthough the dipper is not a web-footed bird, and is not classed by the\r\nnaturalists among the aquatic fowl, but is, indeed, a genuine passerine,\r\nyet he can swim quite dexterously on the surface of the water. However,\r\nhis greatest strength and skill are shown in swimming under water, where\r\nhe propels himself with his wings, often to a considerable distance,\r\neither with or against the current. Sometimes he will allow the current\r\nto carry him a short distance down the stream, but he is always able to\r\nstop himself at a chosen point. \"Ever and anon,\" says Mr. John Muir, in\r\nhis attractive book on \"The Mountains of California,\" \"while searching\r\nfor food in the rushing stream, he sidles out to where the too powerful\r\ncurrent carries him off his feet; then he dexterously rises on the wing\r\nand goes gleaning again in shallower places.\" So it seems that our\r\nlittle acrobat is equal to every emergency that may arise in his\r\nadventurous life.\r\n\r\nIn winter, when the rushing mountain streams are flowing with the sludge\r\nof the half-melted snow, so that he cannot see the bottom, where most of\r\nhis delicacies lie, he betakes himself to the quieter stretches of the\r\nrivers, or to the mill ponds or mountain lakes, where he finds clearer\r\nand smoother water, although a little deeper than he usually selects.\r\nSuch weather does not find him at the end of his resources; no, indeed!\r\nHaving betaken himself to a lake, he does not at once plunge into its\r\ndepths after the manner of a duck, but finding a perch on a snag or a\r\nfallen pine, he sits there a moment, and then, flying out thirty or\r\nforty yards, \"he alights with a dainty glint on the surface, swims\r\nabout, looks down, finally makes up his mind, and disappears with a\r\nsharp stroke of his wings.\" So says Mr. John Muir, who continues: \"After\r\nfeeding for two or three minutes he suddenly reappears, showers the\r\nwater from his wings with one vigorous shake, and rises abruptly into\r\nthe air as if pushed up from beneath, comes back to his perch, sings a\r\nfew minutes, and goes out to dive again; thus coming and going, singing\r\nand diving, at the same place for hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe depths to which the cinclid dives for the food on the bottom is\r\noften from fifteen to twenty feet. When he selects a river instead of a\r\nlake for his winter bathing, its waters, like those of the shallower\r\nstreams, may also contain a large quantity of sludge, thus rendering\r\nthem opaque even to the sharp little eyes of the dipper. Then what does\r\nhe do? He has a very natural and cunning way of solving this problem; he\r\nsimply seeks a deep portion of the river and dives through the turbid\r\nwater to the clear water beneath, where he can plainly see the \"goodies\"\r\non the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that this little bird is mute amid all the watery\r\ntumult of his mountain home, for he is a rare vocalist, his song\r\nmingling with the ripple and gurgle and roar of the streams that he\r\nhaunts. Nor does he sing only in the springtime, but all the year round,\r\non stormy days as well as fair. During Indian summer, when the streams\r\nare small, and silence broods over many a mountain solitude, the song of\r\nthe ousel falls to its lowest ebb; but when winter comes and the streams\r\nare converted into rolling torrents, he resumes his vocal efforts, which\r\nreach their height in early summer. Thus it would seem that the bird's\r\nmood is the gayest when his favorite stream is dashing at its noisiest\r\nand most rapid pace down the steep mountain defiles. The clamor of the\r\nstream often drowns the song of the bird, the movement of his mandibles\r\nbeing seen when not a sound from his music-box can be heard. There must\r\nbe a feeling of fellowship between the bird and the stream he loves so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_No snowstorm can discourage him_\"]\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised to learn that the dipper is an extremely hardy\r\nbird. No snowstorm, however violent, can discourage him, but in the\r\nmidst of it all he sings his most cheerful lays, as if defying all the\r\ngods of the winds. While other birds, even the hardy nuthatches, often\r\nsuccumb to discouragement in cold weather, and move about with\r\nfluffed-up feathers, the very picture of dejection--not so the little\r\ndipper, who always preserves his cheerful temper, and is ready to say,\r\nin acts, if not in words: \"Isn't this the jolliest weather you ever\r\nsaw?\" Away up in Alaska, where the glaciers hold perpetual sway, this\r\nbird has been seen in the month of November as glad and blithesome as\r\nwere his comrades in the summery gorges of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAINS AND FOOTHILLS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA TANAGER--_Pyranga ludoviciana_\r\n(Upper figure, male; lower, female)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters contain a recital of observations made in the\r\nneighborhood of Colorado Springs and in trips on the plains and among\r\nthe mountains in that latitude. Two years later--that is, in 1901--the\r\nrambler's good angel again smiled upon him and made possible another\r\ntour among the Colorado mountains. This time he made Denver, instead of\r\nColorado Springs, the centre of operations; nor did he go alone, his\r\ncompanion being an active boy of fourteen who has a penchant for\r\nButterflies, while that of the writer, as need scarcely be said, is for\r\nthe Birds--in our estimation, the two cardinal B's of the English\r\nlanguage. Imagine two inveterate ramblers, then, with two such\r\nenchanting hobbies, set loose on the Colorado plains and in the\r\nmountains, with the prospect of a month of uninterrupted indulgence in\r\ntheir manias!\r\n\r\nIn the account of my first visit, most of the species met with were\r\ndescribed in detail both as to their habits and personal appearance. In\r\nthe present record no such minutiæ will be necessary so far as the same\r\nspecies were observed, and therefore the chief objects of the following\r\nchapters will be, first, to note the diversities in the avian fauna of\r\nthe two regions; second, to give special attention to such birds as\r\neither were not seen in my first visit or were for some cause partly\r\noverlooked; and, third, to trace the peculiar transitions in bird life\r\nin passing from the plains about Denver to the crest of Gray's Peak,\r\nincluding jaunts to several other localities.\r\n\r\nIn my rambles in the neighborhood of Denver only a few species not\r\npreviously described were observed, and yet there were some noteworthy\r\npoints of difference in the avi-fauna of the two latitudes, which are\r\nonly about seventy-five miles apart. It will perhaps be remembered that,\r\nin the vicinity of Colorado Springs and Manitou, the pretty lazuli\r\nbuntings were quite rare and exceedingly shy, only two or three\r\nindividuals having been seen. The reverse was the case in the suburbs of\r\nDenver and on the irrigated plains between that city and the mountains,\r\nand also in the neighborhood of Boulder, where in all suitable haunts\r\nthe lazulis were constantly at my elbow, lavish enough of their pert\r\nlittle melodies to satisfy the most exacting, and almost as familiar and\r\napproachable as the indigo-birds of the East. It is possible that, for\r\nthe most part, the blue-coated beauties prefer a more northern latitude\r\nthan Colorado Springs for the breeding season.\r\n\r\nAt the latter place I failed to find the burrowing owl, although there\r\ncan be little doubt of his presence there, especially out on the\r\nplains. Not far from Denver one of these uncanny, sepulchral birds was\r\nseen, having been frightened from her tunnel as I came stalking near it.\r\nShe flew over the brow of the hill in her smooth, silent way, and\r\nuttered no syllable of protest as I examined her domicile--or, rather,\r\nthe outside of it. Scattered about the dark doorway were a number of\r\nbones, feathers, and the skin of a frog, telling the story of the _table\r\nd'hôte_ set by this underground dweller before her nestlings. She might\r\nhave put up the crossbones and skull as a sign at the entrance to her\r\nburrow, or even placed there the well-known Dantean legend, \"All hope\r\nabandon, ye who enter here,\" neither of which would have been more\r\nsuggestive than the telltale litter piled up before her door. When I\r\nchased her from her hiding-place, she flew down the hill and alighted on\r\na fence-post in the neighborhood of her nest, uttering several screechy\r\nnotes as I came near her again, as if she meant to say that I was\r\ncarrying the joke a little too far in pursuing her about. Presently she\r\ncircled away on oily wings, and I saw her no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_The dark doorway_\"]\r\n\r\nSo little enthusiasm does such a bird stir within me that I felt too\r\nlazy to follow her about on the arid plain. It may be interesting as a\r\nmatter of scientific information to know that the burrowing owl breeds\r\nin a hole in the ground, and keeps company with the prairie dog and the\r\nrattlesnake, but a bird that lives in a gloomy, malodorous cave, whose\r\nmanners are far from attractive, and whose voice sounds as strident as a\r\nbuzz-saw--surely such a bird can cast no spell upon the observer who is\r\ninterested in the æsthetic side of bird nature. A recent writer, in\r\ndescribing \"A Buzzards' Banquet,\" asks a couple of pregnant questions:\r\n\"Is there anything ugly out of doors? Can the ardent, sympathetic lover\r\nof nature ever find her unlovely?\" To the present writer these questions\r\npresent no Chinese puzzle. He simply brushes all speculation and\r\ntheorizing aside by responding \"Yes,\" to both interrogatories, on the\r\nprinciple that it is sometimes just as well to cut the Gordian knot as\r\nto waste precious time trying to untie it. The burrowing owl makes me\r\nthink of a denizen of the other side of the river Styx, and why should\r\none try to love that which nature has made unattractive, especially when\r\none cannot help one's feeling?\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chronicles no mention, I believe, has been made of one\r\nlittle bird that deserves more than a mere _obiter dictum_. My first\r\nmeeting with the blithesome house-finch of the West occurred in the city\r\nof Denver, in 1899. It could not properly be called a formal\r\npresentment, but was none the less welcome on that account. I had\r\nscarcely stepped out upon the busy street before my ear was accosted by\r\na kind of half twitter and half song that was new to me. \"Surely that is\r\nnot the racket of the English sparrow; it is too musical,\" I remarked to\r\na friend walking by my side.\r\n\r\nPeering among the trees and houses, I presently focussed my field-glass\r\nupon a small, finch-like bird whose coat was striped with gray and\r\nbrown, and whose face, crown, breast, and rump were beautifully tinged\r\nor washed with crimson, giving him quite a dressy appearance. What could\r\nthis chipper little city chap be, with his trig form and well-bred\r\nmanners, in such marked contrast with those of the swaggering English\r\nsparrow? Afterwards he was identified as the house-finch, which rejoices\r\nin the high-sounding Latin name of _Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis_. His\r\ndistribution is restricted to the Rocky Mountain district chiefly south\r\nof the fortieth parallel of north latitude.\r\n\r\nHe is certainly an attractive species, and I wish we could offer\r\nsufficient inducements to bring him east. A bird like him is a boon and\r\nan ornament to the streets and parks of any city that he graces with\r\nhis presence and enlivens with his songs. No selfish recluse is he; no,\r\nindeed! In no dark gulch or wilderness, far from human neighborhood,\r\ndoes he sulkily take up his abode, but prefers the companionship of man\r\nto the solitudes of nature, declaring in all his conduct that he likes\r\nto be where there are \"folks.\" In this respect he bears likeness to the\r\nEnglish sparrow; but let it be remembered that there the analogy stops.\r\nEven his chirruping is musical as he flies overhead, or makes his\r\n_caveat_ from a tree or a telegraph wire against your ill-bred\r\nespionage. He and his plainly clad little spouse build a neat cottage\r\nfor their bairns about the houses, but do not clog the spouting and make\r\nthemselves a nuisance otherwise, as is the habit of their English\r\ncousins.\r\n\r\nThis finch is a minstrel, not of the first class, still one that merits\r\na high place among the minor songsters; and, withal, he is generous with\r\nhis music. You might call him a kind of urban Arion, for there is real\r\nmelody in his little score. As he is an early riser, his matin\r\nvoluntaries often mingled with my half-waking dreams in the morning at\r\ndawn's peeping, and I loved to hear it too well to be angry for being\r\naroused at an unseasonable hour. The song is quite a complicated\r\nperformance at its best, considerably prolonged and varied, running up\r\nand down the chromatic scale with a swing and gallop, and delivered\r\nwith great rapidity, as if the lyrist were in a hurry to have done, so\r\nthat he could get at something else.\r\n\r\nIn my rambles he was found not only in the cities of the plains (Denver,\r\nColorado Springs, and Pueblo), but also in many of the mountain towns\r\nand villages visited, Leadville, over ten thousand feet skyward, being,\r\nI believe, one of the exceptions, while Silver Plume and Graymont were\r\nothers. He does not fancy altitudes, I take it, much over eight thousand\r\nfeet. In the villages of Red Cliff and Glenwood, both beyond the\r\ncontinental divide, he was the same sprightly citizen, making himself\r\nvery much at home.\r\n\r\nMuch as this finch cherishes the society of man, he is quite wary and\r\nsuspicious, and does not fancy being watched. As long as you go on your\r\nway without seeming to notice him, he also goes his way, coming into\r\nplain sight and chirping and singing; but just stop to watch him with\r\nyour binocular, and see how quickly he will take alarm, dart away, and\r\nensconce himself behind a clump of foliage, uttering a protest which\r\nseems to say, \"Why doesn't that old fellow go about his own business?\"\r\nIf in some way the American house-finch could be persuaded to come east,\r\nand the English sparrow could be given papers of extradition, the\r\nexchange would be a relief and a benefit to the whole country.\r\n\r\nSome idyllic days were spent in sauntering about Golden, which keeps\r\nguard at the entrance of Clear Creek Cañon, and has tucked itself in a\r\nbeautiful valley among the foothills, which in turn stand sentinel over\r\nit. In the village itself and along the bush-fringed border of the creek\r\nbelow, as well as in the little park at its border, there were many\r\nbirds, nearly all of which have been described in the previous chapters.\r\nHowever, several exceptions are worthy of note. A matted copse a mile\r\nand a half below the town afforded a hiding-place for three young or\r\nfemale redstarts, which were \"playing butterfly,\" as usual, and chanting\r\ntheir vivacious little tunes. These and several near Boulder were the\r\nonly redstarts seen in my Colorado wanderings, although Professor Cooke\r\nsays they breed sparingly on the plains, and a little more commonly in\r\nthe mountains to an altitude of eight thousand feet, while one observer\r\nsaw a female in July at the timber-line, which is three thousand feet\r\nabove the normal range of the species. Why did not this birdlet remain\r\nwithin the bounds set by the scientific guild? Suit for contempt of\r\ncourt should be brought against it. Redstarts must have been very scarce\r\nin the regions over which I rambled, else I certainly should have\r\nnoticed birds that are so fearless and so lavish of song.\r\n\r\nOne day my companion and I clambered up the steep side of a mesa some\r\ndistance below Golden--that is, the base of the mesa was below the\r\nvillage, while its top towered far above it. A mesa was a structural\r\nportion of Colorado topography that neither of the two ramblers had yet\r\nexplored, and we were anxious to know something about its resources from\r\na natural history point of view. It was hard climbing on account of the\r\nsteepness of the acclivity, its rocky character, and the thick network\r\nof bushes and brambles in many places; but \"excelsior\" was our motto in\r\nall our mountaineering, and we allowed no surmountable difficulties to\r\ndaunt us. What birds select such steep places for a habitat? Here lived\r\nin happy domesticity the lyrical green-tailed towhee, the bird of the\r\nliquid voice, the poet laureate of the steep, bushy mountain sides, just\r\nas the water-ousel is the poet of the cascades far down in the cañons\r\nand gulches; here also thrived the spurred towhees, one of which had\r\ntucked a nest beneath a bush cradling three speckled eggs. This was the\r\nsecond nest of this species I had found, albeit not the last. Here also\r\ndwelt the rock wren, a little bird that was new to me and that I had not\r\nfound in the latitude of Colorado Springs either east or west of the\r\ncontinental divide. A description of this anchorite of the rocks will be\r\ngiven in a later chapter. I simply pause here to remark that he has a\r\nsort of \"monarch-of-all-I-survey\" air as he sits on a tall sandstone\r\nrock and blows the music from his Huon's horn on the messenger breezes.\r\nHis wild melodies, often sounding like a blast from a bugle, are in\r\nperfect concord with the wild and rugged acclivities which he haunts,\r\nfrom which he can command many a prospect that pleases, whether he\r\nglances down into the valleys or up to the silver-capped mountain peaks.\r\nOne cannot help feeling--at least, after one has left his rock-strewn\r\ndwelling-place--that a kind of glamour hangs about it and him.\r\n\r\nThe loud hurly-burly of the long-tailed chat reached us from a bushy\r\nhollow not far away. So far as I could determine, this fellow is as\r\ngarrulous a churl and bully as his yellow-breasted cousin so well known\r\nin the East. (Afterwards I found the chats quite numerous at Boulder.)\r\nAt length we scaled the cliffs, and presently stood on the edge of the\r\nmesa, which we found to be a somewhat rolling plateau, looking much like\r\nthe plains themselves in general features, with here and there a hint of\r\nverdure, on which a herd of cattle were grazing. The pasture was the\r\nbuffalo grass. Does the bird-lover ask what species dwell on a treeless\r\nmesa like this? It was the home of western grassfinches, western\r\nmeadow-larks, turtle doves, desert horned larks, and a little bird that\r\nwas new to me, evidently Brewer's sparrow. Its favorite resort was in\r\nthe low bushes growing on the border of the mesa and along the edge of\r\nthe cliff. Its song was unique, the opening syllable running low on the\r\nalto clef, while the closing notes constituted a very respectable\r\nsoprano. A few extremely shy sparrows flitted about in the thickets of a\r\nhollow as we began our descent, and I have no doubt they were Lincoln's\r\nsparrows.\r\n\r\nThe valley and the irrigated plain were the birds' elysium. Here we\r\nfirst saw and heard that captivating bird, the lark bunting, as will be\r\nfully set forth in the closing chapter. This was one of the birds that\r\nhad escaped me in my first visit to Colorado, save as I had caught\r\ntantalizing glimpses of him from the car-window on the plain beyond\r\nDenver, and when I went south to Colorado Springs, I utterly failed to\r\nfind him. It has been a sort of riddle to me that not one could be\r\ndiscovered in that vicinity, while two years later these birds were\r\nabundant on the plains both east and west of Denver. If Colorado Springs\r\nis a little too far south for them in the summer, Denver is obviously\r\njust to their liking. No less abundant were the western meadow-larks,\r\nwhich flew and sang with a kind of lyrical intoxication over the green\r\nalfalfa fields.\r\n\r\nOne morning we decided to walk some distance up Clear Creek Cañon. At\r\nthe opening of the cañon, Brewer's blackbirds were scuttling about in\r\nthe bushes that broidered the steep banks of the tumultuous stream, and\r\na short distance up in the gorge a lazuli bunting sat on a telegraph\r\nwire and piped his merry lay. Soon the cañon narrowed, grew dark and\r\nforbidding, and the steep walls rose high on both sides, compelling the\r\nrailway to creep like a half-imprisoned serpent along the foot of the\r\ncliffs; then the birds disappeared, not caring to dwell in such dark,\r\nmore than half-immured places. Occasionally a magpie could be seen\r\nsailing overhead at an immense height, crossing over from one hillside\r\nto the other, turning his head as he made the transit, to get a view of\r\nthe two peripatetics in the gulch below, anxious to discover whether\r\nthey were bent on brigandage of any kind.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached a point where the mountain side did not look so\r\nsteep as elsewhere, and we decided to scale it. From the railway it\r\nlooked like a short climb, even if a little difficult, and we began it\r\nwith only a slight idea of the magnitude of our undertaking. The fact\r\nis, mountain climbing is a good deal more than pastime; it amounts to\r\nwork, downright hard work. In the present instance, no sooner had we\r\ngained one height than another loomed steep and challenging above us, so\r\nthat we climbed the mountain by a series of immense steps or terraces.\r\nAt places the acclivity was so steep that we were compelled to scramble\r\nover the rocks on all fours, and were glad to stop frequently and draw\r\nbreath and rest our tired limbs. My boy comrade, having fewer things\r\nthan I to lure him by the way, and being, perhaps, a little more agile\r\nas well, went far on ahead of me, often standing on a dizzy pinnacle of\r\nrock, and waving his butterfly-net or his cap in the air, and shouting\r\nat the top of his voice to encourage his lagging parent and announce his\r\ntriumph as a mountaineer.\r\n\r\nHowever, the birdman can never forget his hobby. There were a few birds\r\non that precipitous mountain side, and that lent it its chief\r\nattraction. At one place a spurred towhee flitted about in a bushy clump\r\nand called much like a catbird--an almost certain proof of a nest on the\r\nsteep, rocky wall far up from the roaring torrent in the gorge below. On\r\na stony ridge still farther up, a rock wren was ringing his peculiar\r\nscore, which sounds so much like a challenge, while still farther up, in\r\na cluster of stunted pines, a long-crested jay lilted about and called\r\npetulantly, until I came near, when he swung across the cañon, and I saw\r\nhim no more.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours of hard climbing, we reached the summit, from\r\nwhich we were afforded a magnificent view of the foothills, the mesas,\r\nand the stretching plains below us, while above us to the west hills\r\nrose on hills until they culminated in mighty snow-capped peaks and\r\nridges. It must not be supposed, because the snow-mantled summits in the\r\nwest loomed far above our present station, that this mountain which we\r\nhad ascended was a comparatively insignificant affair. The fact is, it\r\nwas of huge bulk and great height measured from its base in the cañon;\r\nalmost as much of a mountain, in itself considered, as Gray's Peak. It\r\nmust be borne in mind that the snowy peaks were from thirty to forty\r\nmiles away, and that there is a gradual ascent the entire distance to\r\nthe upper valleys and gorges which creep about the bases of the loftiest\r\npeaks and ridges. A mountain rising from the foothills may be almost as\r\nbulky and high and precipitous as one of the alpine peaks covered with\r\neternal snow. Its actual altitude above sea-level may be less by many\r\nthousand feet, while its height from the surrounding cañons and valleys\r\nmay be almost, if not quite, as great. The alpine peaks have the\r\nadvantage of majesty of situation, because the general level of the\r\ncountry from which they rise is very high. There we stood at a sort of\r\noutdoor halfway house between the plains and the towering ridges, and I\r\ncan only say that the view was superb.\r\n\r\nThere were certain kinds of birds which had brought their household gods\r\nto the mountain's crest. Lewis's woodpeckers ambled about over the\r\nsummit and rocky ridges, catching insects on the wing, as is their wont.\r\nSome distance below the summit a pair of them had a nest in a dead pine\r\nsnag, from the orifice of which one was seen to issue. A mother hawk was\r\nfeeding a couple of youngsters on the snarly branch of a dead pine.\r\nAlmost on the summit a western nighthawk sprang up from my feet. On the\r\nbare ground, without the faintest sign of a nest, lay her two speckled\r\neggs, which she had been brooding. She swept around above the summit in\r\nimmense zigzag spirals while I examined her roofless dwelling-place. It\r\nwas interesting to one bird-lover, at least, to know that the nighthawk\r\nbreeds in such places. Like their eastern congeners, the western\r\nnighthawks are fond of \"booming.\" At intervals a magpie would swing\r\nacross the cañon, looking from side to side, the impersonation of\r\ncautious shyness. A few rods below the crest a couple of rock wrens were\r\nflitting about some large rocks, creeping in and out among the crevices\r\nlike gray mice, and at length one of them slyly fed a well-fledged\r\nyoungster. This proves that these birds, like many of their congeners,\r\nare partial to a commanding lookout for a nesting site. These were the\r\nonly occupants of the mountain's brow at the time of our visit, although\r\nin one of the hollows below us the spurred and green-tailed towhees were\r\nrendering a selection from Haydn's \"Creation,\" probably \"The heavens are\r\ntelling.\"\r\n\r\nNo water was to be found from the bottom of the cañon to the summit of\r\nthe mountain; all was as dry as the plain itself. The feathered tenants\r\nof the dizzy height were doubtless compelled to fly down into the gorge\r\nfor drinking and bathing purposes, and then wing up again to the\r\nsummit--certainly no light task for such birds as the wrens and\r\ntowhees.\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak one morning I made my way to a small park on the\r\noutskirts of the village to listen to the birds' matutinal concert. The\r\nearliest singers were the western robins, which began their carols at\r\nthe first hint of the coming dawn; the next to break the silence were\r\nthe western wood-pewees; then the summer warblers chimed in, followed by\r\nthe western grassfinches, Bullock's orioles, meadow-larks, and lark\r\nsparrows, in the order named. Before daylight had fully come a family of\r\nmountain bluebirds were taking their breakfast at the border of the\r\npark, while their human relatives were still snoring in bed. The\r\nbluebirds are governed by old-fashioned rules even in this very \"modern\"\r\nage, among their maxims being,--\r\n\r\n    \"Early to bed and early to rise,\r\n    Makes bluebirds healthy and wealthy and wise.\"\r\n\r\nJust now I came across a pretty conceit of John B. Tabb, which more\r\naptly sets off the mountain blue than it does his eastern relative, and\r\nwhich I cannot forbear quoting:\r\n\r\n    \"When God made a host of them,\r\n    One little flower lacked a stem\r\n      To hold its blossom blue;\r\n    So into it He breathed a song,\r\n    And suddenly, with petals strong\r\n      As wings, away it flew.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is Eben E. Rexford, who almost loses himself in a tangle of\r\nmetaphors in his efforts to express his admiration of this bird with\r\nthe cerulean plumes. Hark to his rhapsody:\r\n\r\n    \"Winged lute that we call a bluebird, you blend in a silver strain\r\n    The sound of the laughing waters, the patter of spring's sweet rain,\r\n    The voice of the winds, the sunshine, and fragrance of blossoming\r\n        things;\r\n    Ah! you are an April poem that God has dowered with wings.\"\r\n\r\nOn our return to the plains from a two weeks' trip to Georgetown and\r\nGray's Peak, we spent several days at Arvada, a village about halfway\r\nbetween Denver and Golden. The place was rife with birds, all of which\r\nare described in other chapters of this volume.[10] Mention need be made\r\nhere only of the song-sparrows, which were seen in a bushy place through\r\nwhich a purling stream wound its way. Of course, they were _Melospiza\r\nfasciata montana_, but their clear, bell-like trills were precise copies\r\nof those of the merry lowland minstrels of the East. Special attention\r\nis called to the fact that, in my first visit to Colorado, the only\r\nplace in which mountain song-sparrows were met with was Buena Vista,\r\nquite a distance up among the mountains, while in the visit now being\r\ndescribed they were not found anywhere in the mountains, save in the\r\nvale below Cassels. They were breeding at Arvada, for a female was seen\r\ncarrying a worm in her bill, and I am sure a nest might easily have been\r\nfound had I not been so busily occupied in the study of other and rarer\r\nspecies. However, the recollection of the merry lyrists with the\r\nspeckled breasts and silvery voices, brings to mind Mr. Ernest Thompson\r\nSeton's \"Myth of the Song-Sparrow,\" from which it will be seen that this\r\nattractive bird has had something of an adventurous career:\r\n\r\n    \"His mother was the Brook, his sisters were the Reeds,\r\n    And they every one applauded when he sang about his deeds.\r\n    His vest was white, his mantle brown, as clear as they could be,\r\n    And his songs were fairly bubbling o'er with melody and glee.\r\n    But an envious Neighbor splashed with mud our Brownie's coat and vest,\r\n    And then a final handful threw that stuck upon his breast.\r\n    The Brook-bird's mother did her best to wash the stains away,\r\n    But there they stuck, and, as it seems, are very like to stay.\r\n    And so he wears the splashes and the mud blotch, as you see;\r\n    But his songs are bubbling over still with melody and glee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_His songs are bubbling over still with melody and\r\nglee._\"\r\n\r\n_Song Sparrow_]\r\n\r\n    [10] I find I have overlooked the western Maryland yellow-throat,\r\n    which was seen here; also near Colorado Springs, and in several\r\n    other bushy spots, only on the plains. It seldom ascends into the\r\n    mountains, never far. Its song and habits are similar to those of\r\n    its eastern congener.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMBLES ABOUT GEORGETOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock on the morning of June 22, the two ramblers boarded a\r\nColorado and Southern train, and bowled up Clear Creek Cañon to\r\nGeorgetown. Having been studying winged creatures on the plains and\r\namong the foothills, mesas, and lower mountains, we now proposed to go\r\nup among the mountains that were mountains in good earnest, and see what\r\nwe could find.\r\n\r\nThe village of Georgetown nestles in a deep pocket of the mountains. The\r\nvalley is quite narrow, and on three sides, save where the two branches\r\nof Clear Creek have hewn out their cañons, the ridges rise at a sharp\r\nangle to a towering height, while here and there a white-cap peeps out\r\nthrough the depressions. Those parts of the narrow vale that are\r\nirrigated by the creek and its numerous tiny tributaries are beautiful\r\nin their garb of green, while the areas that are not thus refreshed are\r\nas gray as the arid portions of the plains themselves. And that is the\r\ncase everywhere among the Rockies--where no water flows over the\r\nsurface the porous, sandy soil is dry and parched. The altitude of\r\nGeorgetown is eight thousand four hundred and seventy-six feet. We were\r\ntherefore three thousand feet higher than we had been in the morning,\r\nand had a right to expect a somewhat different avi-fauna, an expectation\r\nin which we were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nOur initial ramble took us down the valley. The first bird noted was a\r\nfamiliar one--the warbling vireo, which is very abundant in Colorado in\r\nits favorite localities, where all day you may be lulled by its \"silvery\r\nconverse, just begun and never ended.\" No description of a bird so well\r\nknown in both the East and the West is required, but the one seen that\r\nday gave a new performance, which seems to be worthy of more than a\r\npassing notice. Have other bird students observed it? The bird was first\r\nseen flitting about in the trees bordering the street; then it flew to\r\nits little pendent nest in the twigs. I turned my glass upon it, and,\r\nbehold, there it sat in its tiny hammock singing its mercurial tune at\r\nthe top of its voice. It continued its solo during the few minutes I\r\nstopped to watch it, glancing over the rim of its nest at its auditor\r\nwith a pert gleam in its twinkling eyes. That was the first and only\r\ntime I have ever seen a bird indulging its lyrical whim while it sat on\r\nits nest. Whether the bird was a male or a female I could not determine,\r\nbut, whatever its sex, its little bosom was bubbling over with\r\nmusic.[11]\r\n\r\n    [11] After the foregoing was written, I chanced upon the following\r\n    note in \"Bird Lore\" for September and October, 1901, written by a\r\n    lady at Moline, Illinois, who had made an early morning visit to the\r\n    haunt of a warbling vireo: \"Seated on the ground, in a convenient\r\n    place for watching the vireo, which was on the nest, we were soon\r\n    attracted by a vireo's song. Search for the singer failed to find\r\n    it, until we noted that the bird on the nest seemed to be singing.\r\n    Then, as we watched, over and over again the bird was seen to lift\r\n    up its head and pour out the long, rich warble--a most delicious\r\n    sight and sound. Are such ways usual among birds, or did we chance\r\n    to see and hear an unusual thing?\"\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that the western robins were abundant about\r\nGeorgetown, as they were on the plains and among the foothills. They\r\nwere principally engaged just now in feeding their young, which had\r\nalready left their nests. Presently I shall have more to say about these\r\nbirds. Just now I was aware of some little strangers darting about in\r\nthe air, uttering a fine, querulous note, and at length descending to\r\nthe ground to feast daintily on the seeds of a low plant. Here I could\r\nsee them plainly with my glass, for they gave me gracious permission to\r\ngo quite near them. Their backs were striped, the predominant color\r\nbeing brown or dark gray, while the whitish under parts were streaked\r\nwith dusk, and there were yellow decorations on the wings and tails,\r\nwhether the birds were at rest or in flight. When the wings were spread\r\nand in motion, the golden ornamentation gave them a filmy appearance.\r\nOn the wing, the birds, as I afterwards observed, often chirped a little\r\nlay that bore a close resemblance in certain parts to the\r\n\"pe-chick-o-pe\" of the American goldfinch. Indeed, a number of their\r\nnotes suggested that bird, as did also their manner of flight, which was\r\nquite undulatory. The birds were the pine siskins. They are very common\r\nin the Rockies, ranging from an elevation of eight thousand feet to the\r\ntimber-line. This pert and dainty little bird is the same wherever found\r\nin North America, having no need of the cognomen \"western\" prefixed to\r\nhis name when he takes it into his wise little head to make his abode in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n_CLEAR CREEK VALLEY_\r\n\r\n_A scene near Georgetown. The copses in the valley are the home of\r\nwhite-crowned sparrows, willow thrushes, Lincoln's sparrows and Wilson's\r\nwarblers; the steep, bushy acclivities are selected by the spurred and\r\ngreen-tailed towhees, Audubon's and Macgillivray's warblers; while the\r\nwestern robins, pine siskins, and broad-tailed humming-birds range all\r\nover the region. The robins and siskins make some of their most\r\nthrilling plunges over such cliffs as are shown in the picture._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps recall that a flock of pine siskins were seen,\r\ntwo years prior, in a patch of pine scrub a short distance below\r\nLeadville, at which time I was uncertain as to their identity. Oddly\r\nenough, that was the only time I saw these birds in my first trip to\r\nColorado, but here in the Georgetown region, only seventy-five or a\r\nhundred miles farther north, no species were more plentiful than they.\r\n\r\nThe siskins try to sing--I say \"try\" advisedly. It is one of the oddest\r\nbits of bird vocalization you ever heard, a wheezy little tune in the\r\nascending scale--a kind of crescendo--which sounds as if it were\r\nproduced by inhalation rather than exhalation. It is as labored as the\r\nalto strain of the clay-colored sparrow of the Kansas and Nebraska\r\nprairies, although it runs somewhat higher on the staff. The siskins\r\nseen at Georgetown moved about in good-sized flocks, feeding awhile on\r\nweed-seeds on the sunny slopes, and then wheeling with a merry chirp up\r\nto the pine-clad sides of the mountains. As they were still in the\r\ngregarious frame at Georgetown, I concluded that they had not yet begun\r\nto mate and build their nests in that locality. Afterwards I paid not a\r\nlittle attention to them farther up in the mountains, and saw several\r\nfeeding their young, but, as their nests are built high in the pines,\r\nthey are very difficult to find, or, if found, to examine. Our birdlets\r\nhave superb powers of flight, and actually seem to revel in hurling\r\nthemselves down a precipice or across a chasm with a recklessness that\r\nmakes the observer's blood run cold. Sometimes they will dart out in the\r\nair from a steep mountain side, sing a ditty much like the goldfinch's,\r\nthen circle back to their native pines on the dizzy cliff.\r\n\r\nI must be getting back to my first ramble below Georgetown. Lured by the\r\nlyrics of the green-tailed towhee, I climbed the western acclivity a few\r\nhundred feet, but found that few birds choose such dry and eerie places\r\nfor a habitat. Indeed, this was generally my experience in rambling\r\namong the mountains; the farther up the arid steeps, the fewer the\r\nbirds. If you will follow a mountain brook up a sunny slope or open\r\nvalley, you will be likely to find many birds; but wander away from the\r\nwater courses, and you will look for them, oftentimes, in vain. The\r\ngreen-tailed towhees, spurred towhees, Audubon's warblers, and mountain\r\nhermit thrushes are all partial to acclivities, even very steep ones,\r\nbut they do not select those that are too remote from the babbling brook\r\nto which they may conveniently resort for drinking and bathing.\r\n\r\nA green and bushy spot a half mile below the village was the home of a\r\nnumber of white-crowned sparrows. None of them were seen on the plains\r\nor in the foothills; they had already migrated from the lower altitudes,\r\nand had sought their summer residences in the upper mountain valleys,\r\nwhere they may be found in great abundance from an elevation of eight\r\nthousand feet to copsy haunts here and there far above the timber-line\r\nhard by the fields of snow.\r\n\r\nThe white-crowns in the Georgetown valley seemed to be excessively shy,\r\nand their singing was a little too reserved to be thoroughly enjoyable,\r\nfor which reason I am disposed to think that mating and nesting had not\r\nyet begun, or I should have found evidences of it, as their grassy cots\r\non the ground and in the bushes are readily discovered. Other birds that\r\nwere seen in this afternoon's ramble were Wilson's and Audubon's\r\nwarblers, the spotted sandpiper, and that past-master in the art of\r\nwhining, the killdeer. Another warbler's trill was heard in the thicket,\r\nbut I was unable to identify the singer that evening, for he kept\r\nhimself conscientiously hidden in the tanglewood. A few days later it\r\nturned out to be one of the most beautiful feathered midgets of the\r\nRockies, Macgillivray's warbler, which was seen in a number of places,\r\nusually on bushy slopes. He and his mate often set up a great to-do by\r\nchirping and flitting about, and I spent hours in trying to find their\r\nnests, but with no other result than to wear out my patience and rubber\r\nboots. I can recall no other Colorado bird, either large or small,\r\nexcept the mountain jay, that made so much ado about nothing, so far as\r\nI could discover. But I love them still, on account of the beauty of\r\ntheir plumage and the gentle rhythm of their trills.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, chilly as the weather was--and it was cold enough to\r\nmake one shiver even in bed--the western robins opened the day's concert\r\nwith a splendid voluntary, waking me out of my slumbers and forcing me\r\nout of doors for an early walk. No one but a systematic ornithologist\r\nwould be able to mark the difference between the eastern and western\r\ntypes of robins, for their manners, habits, and minstrelsy are alike,\r\nand their markings, too, so far as ordinary observation goes. The\r\ncarolling of the two varieties is similar, so far as I could\r\ndiscern--the same cherry ringing melody, their voices having a like\r\npropensity to break into falsetto, becoming a veritable squeak,\r\nespecially early in the season before their throat-harps are well tuned.\r\nWith his powerful muscles and wide stretch of wing the robin is\r\nadmirably adapted to the life of a mountaineer. You find him from the\r\nplains to the timber-line, sometimes even in the deepest cañons and on\r\nthe most precipitous mountain sides, always the same busy, noisy, cheery\r\nbody. One day I saw a robin dart like a meteor from the top of a high\r\nridge over the cliffs to the valley below, where he alighted on a\r\ncultivated field almost as lightly as a flake of snow. He--probably she\r\n(what a trouble these pronouns are, anyway!)--gathered a mouthful of\r\nworms for his nestlings, then dashed up to the top of the ridge again,\r\nwhich he did, not by flying out into the air, but by keeping close up to\r\nthe steep, cliffy wall, striking a rock here and twig there with his\r\nagile feet to help him in rising. The swiftness of the robin's movements\r\nabout the gorges, abysses, and precipices of the mountains often\r\ninspires awe in the beholder's breast, and, on reflection, stirs him\r\nwith envy. Many nests were found in the Georgetown valley, in woodsy and\r\nbushy places on the route to Gray's Peak as far as the timber-line, in\r\nthe neighborhood of Boulder, in the Platte River Cañon, in South Park,\r\nand in the Blue River region beyond the Divide. Some of the nests\r\ncontained eggs, others young in various stages of plumage, and still\r\nothers were already deserted. For general ubiquity as a species, commend\r\nme to the American robin, whether of the eastern or western type.\r\nWherever found he is a singer, and it is only to be regretted that--\r\n\r\n    \"All will not hear thy sweet, out-pouring joy\r\n    That with morn's stillness blends the voice of song,\r\n    For over-anxious cares their souls employ,\r\n    That else, upon thy music borne along\r\n    And the light wings of heart-ascending prayer,\r\n    Had learned that Heaven is pleased thy simple joys to share.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Western Robin_\r\n\r\n\"_Out-pouring joy_\"]\r\n\r\nIn Georgetown, Silver Plume, and other mountain towns the lovely\r\nviolet-green swallow is frequently seen--a distinctly western species\r\nand one of the most richly apparelled birds of the Rockies. It nests in\r\nall sorts of niches and crannies about the houses, often sits calmly on\r\na telegraph wire and preens its iridescent plumes, and sometimes utters\r\na weak and squeaky little trill, which, no doubt, passes for first-rate\r\nmusic in swallowdom, whatever we human critics might think of it. Before\r\nman came and settled in those valleys, the violet-greens found the\r\ncrevices of rocks well enough adapted to their needs for nesting sites,\r\nbut now they prefer cosey niches and crannies in human dwellings, and\r\nappear to appreciate the society of human beings.\r\n\r\nFor over a week we made Georgetown our headquarters, going off every day\r\nto the regions round about. Among my most treasured finds here was the\r\nnest of Audubon's warbler--my first. It was saddled in the crotch of a\r\nsmall pine a short distance up an acclivity, and was prettily roofed\r\nover with a thick network of branches and twigs. Four white, daintily\r\nspeckled eggs lay in the bottom of the cup. While I was sitting in the\r\nshadow of the pine, some motion of mine caused the little owner to\r\nspring from her nest, and this led to its discovery. As she flitted\r\nabout in the bushes, she uttered a sharp _chip_, sometimes consisting of\r\na double note. The nest was about four feet from the ground, its walls\r\nbuilt of grasses and weed-stems, and its concave little floor carpeted\r\nwith cotton and feathers. A cosey cottage it was, fit for the little\r\npoets that erected it. Subsequently I made many long and tiresome\r\nefforts to find nests of the Audubons, but all these efforts were\r\nfutile.\r\n\r\nOne enchanting day--the twenty-fourth of June--was spent in making a\r\ntrip, with butterfly-net and field-glass, to Green Lake, an emerald gem\r\nset in the mountains at an altitude of ten thousand feet, a few miles\r\nfrom Georgetown. Before leaving the town, our first gray-headed junco\r\nfor this expedition was seen. He had come to town for his breakfast, and\r\nwas flitting about on the lawns and in the trees bordering the street,\r\nhelping himself to such dainties as pleased his palate. It may be said\r\nhere that the gray-headed juncos were observed at various places all\r\nalong the way from Georgetown to Green Lake and far above that body of\r\nwater. Not so with the broad-tailed hummers, which were not seen above\r\nabout eight thousand five hundred feet, while the last warbling vireo of\r\nthe day was seen and heard at an altitude of nine thousand feet,\r\npossibly a little more, when he decided that the air was as rare as was\r\ngood for his health.\r\n\r\nA short distance up the cañon of the west branch of Clear Creek, a new\r\nkind of flycatcher was first heard, and presently seen with my glass. He\r\nsat on a cliff or flitted from rock to bush. He uttered a sharp call,\r\n\"Cheep, cheep, cheep\"; his under parts were bright yellow, his upper\r\nparts yellow-olive, growing darker on the crown, and afterwards a nearer\r\nview revealed dark or dusky wings, yellowish or gray wing-bars, and\r\nyellow eye-rings. He was the western flycatcher, and bears close\r\nlikeness to our eastern yellow-breasted species. Subsequently he was\r\nquite frequently met with, but never far above the altitude of\r\nGeorgetown.\r\n\r\nIn the same cañon a beautiful Macgillivray's warbler was observed, and\r\ntwo water-ousels went dashing up the meandering stream, keeping close\r\nto the seething and roaring waters, but never stopping to sing or bid us\r\nthe time of day. Very few ousels were observed in our rambles in this\r\nregion, and no nests rewarded my search, whereas in the vicinity of\r\nColorado Springs, as the reader will recall, these interesting birds\r\nwere quite frequently near at hand. A mother robin holding a worm in her\r\nbill sped down the gulch with the swiftness of an arrow. We soon reached\r\na belt of quaking asps where there were few birds. This was succeeded by\r\na zone of pines. The green-tailed towhees did not accompany us farther\r\nin our climb than to an elevation of about nine thousand three hundred\r\nfeet, but the siskins were chirping and cavorting about and above us all\r\nthe way, many of them evidently having nests in the tops of the tall\r\npines on the dizzy cliffs. Likewise the hermit thrushes were seen in\r\nsuitable localities by the way, and also at the highest point we reached\r\nthat day, an elevation of perhaps ten thousand five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nWhile some species were, so to speak, our \"companions in travel\" the\r\nentire distance from the town to the lake, and others went with us only\r\na part of the way, still other species found habitats only in the higher\r\nregions clambering far up toward the timber-line. Among these were the\r\nmountain jays, none of which were found as far down the range as\r\nGeorgetown. They began to proclaim their presence by raucous calls as\r\nsoon as we arrived in the vicinity of Green Lake. A family of them were\r\nhurtling about in the pine woods, allowing themselves to be inspected at\r\nshort range, and filling the hollows with their uncanny calls. What a\r\nvoice the mountain jay has! Nature did a queer thing when she put a\r\n\"horse-fiddle\" into the larynx of this bird--but it is not ours to ask\r\nthe reason why, simply to study her as she is. In marked contrast with\r\nthe harsh calls of these mountain hobos were the roulades of the sweet\r\nand musical ruby-crowned kinglets, which had absented themselves from\r\nthe lower altitudes, but were abundant in the timber belts about ten\r\nthousand feet up the range and still higher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Red-naped Sapsuckers_\r\n\r\n\"_Chiselling grubs out of the bark_\"]\r\n\r\nOn the border of the lake, among some gnarly pines, I stumbled upon a\r\nwoodpecker that was entirely new to my eastern eyes--one that I had not\r\nseen in my previous touring among the heights of the Rockies. He was\r\nsedulously pursuing his vocation--a divine call, no doubt--of chiselling\r\ngrubs out of the bark of the pine trees, making the chips fly, and\r\nproducing at intervals that musical snare-drumming which always sets\r\nthe poet to dreaming of sylvan solitudes. What was the bird? The\r\nred-naped sapsucker, a beautifully habited Chesterfield in plumes. He\r\npresently ambled up the steep mountain side, and buried himself in the\r\npine forest, and I saw him no more, and none of his kith.\r\n\r\nWhen I climbed up over a tangle of rocks to a woodsy ravine far above\r\nthe lake, it seemed at first as if there were no birds in the place,\r\nthat it was given up entirely to solitude; but the winged creatures were\r\nonly shy and cautious for the nonce, waiting to learn something about\r\nthe errand and disposition of their uninvited, or, rather, self-invited,\r\nguest, before they ventured to give him a greeting. Presently they\r\ndiscovered that he was not a collector, hunter, nest-robber, or ogre of\r\nany other kind, and there was the swish of wings around me, and a medley\r\nof chirps and songs filled the sequestered spot. Away up here the\r\ngray-headed juncos were trilling like warblers, and hopping about on\r\ntheir pine-needle carpet, creeping in and out among the rocks, hunting\r\nfor tidbits. Here also was the mountain chickadee, found at this season\r\nin the heights hard by the alpine zone, singing his dulcet minor strain,\r\n\"Te-te-re-e-e, te-eet,\" sometimes adding another \"te-eet\" by way of\r\nspecial emphasis and adornment. Oh, the sweet little piper piping only\r\nfor Pan! The loneliness of the place was accentuated by the sad cadenzas\r\nof the mountain hermit thrushes. Swallows of some kind--cliff-swallows,\r\nno doubt--were silently weaving invisible filigree across the sky above\r\nthe tops of the stately pines.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we made our way, with not a little laborious effort, to\r\nthe farther end of the lake, across which a red-shafted flicker would\r\noccasionally wing its galloping flight; thence through a wilderness of\r\nlarge rocks and fallen pines to a beckoning ridge, where, to our\r\nsurprise, another beautiful aqueous sheet greeted our vision in the\r\nvalley beyond. Descending to its shores, we had still another\r\nsurprise--its waters were brown instead of green. Here were two mountain\r\nlakes not more than a quarter of a mile apart, one of which was green\r\nand the other brown, each with a beauty all its own. In the brown lake\r\nnear the shore there were glints of gold as the sun shone through its\r\nripples on the rocks at the bottom. Afterwards we learned that the name\r\nof this liquid gem was Clear Lake, and that the western branch of Clear\r\nCreek flows through it, tarrying a while to sport and dally with the\r\nsunbeams. While Green Lake was embowered in a forest of pine, its\r\ncompanion lay in the open sunlight, unflecked by the shadow of a tree.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of Clear Lake we found a green, bosky and bushy corner,\r\nwhich formed the summer tryst of white-crowned sparrows, Wilson's\r\nwarblers, and broad-tailed humming-birds, none of which could find a\r\nsuitable habitat on the rocky, forest-locked shores of Green Lake. A\r\npigeon hawk, I regretted to note, had settled among the bushes, and was\r\nwatching for quarry, making the only fly in the amber of the enchanted\r\nspot. A least flycatcher flitted about in the copse some distance up a\r\nshallow runway. I trudged up the valley about a mile above Clear Lake,\r\nand found a green, open meadow, with clumps of bushes here and there, in\r\nwhich a few white-crowned sparrows and Wilson's warblers had taken up at\r\nleast a temporary dwelling; but the wind was blowing shiveringly from\r\nthe snow-capped mountains not many miles away, and there was still a\r\nwintry aspect about the vale. The cold evidently affected the birds as\r\nit did myself, for they lisped only a few bars of song in a half-hearted\r\nway. Evening was approaching, and the two travellers--the human ones, I\r\nmean--started on the trail down the valleys and cañons toward\r\nGeorgetown, which they reached at dusk, tired, but thankful for the\r\nprivilege of spending an idyllic day among their winged companions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pigeon Hawk_\r\n\r\n\"_Watching for quarry_\"]\r\n\r\nFollowing a wagon road, the next day, across a pass some distance below\r\nGeorgetown brought us into another valley, whose green meadows and\r\ncultivated fields lay a little lower, perhaps a couple hundred feet,\r\nthan the valley from which we had come. Here we found many Brewer's\r\nblackbirds, of which there were very few in the vicinity of Georgetown.\r\nThey were feeding their young, some of which had already left the nest.\r\nNo red-winged blackbirds had been seen in the Georgetown valley, while\r\nhere there was a large colony of them, many carrying food to the\r\nbantlings in grass and bush. Otherwise there was little difference\r\nbetween the avi-fauna of the two valleys.\r\n\r\nOne morning I climbed the steep mountain just above Georgetown, the one\r\nthat forms the divide between the two branches of Clear Creek. A western\r\nchipping sparrow sat trilling on the top of a small pine, as unafraid as\r\nthe chippie that rings his silvery peals about your dooryard in the\r\nEast; nor could I distinguish any difference between the minstrelsy of\r\nthis westerner and his well-known cousin of Ohio. He dexterously caught\r\nan insect on the wing, having learned that trick, perhaps, from his\r\nneighbor, the little western flycatcher, which also lived on the slope.\r\nHermit thrushes, Audubon's warblers, and warbling vireos dwelt on the\r\nlower part of the acclivity. When I climbed far up the steep wall,\r\nscarcely able to cling to its gravelly surface, I found very few birds;\r\nonly a flycatcher and an Audubon's warbler, while below me the hermit\r\nthrushes were chanting a sacred oratorio in the pine woods.\r\n\r\nOn another day the train bore us around the famous \"Loop\" to Silver\r\nPlume. In the beautiful pine grove at the terminus of the railway there\r\nwere many birds--siskins, chipping sparrows, western robins and\r\nruby-crowned kinglets; and they were making the place vocal with melody,\r\nuntil I began to inspect them with my glass, when they suddenly lapsed\r\ninto a silence that was as trying as it was profound. By and by,\r\ndiscretion having had her perfect work, they metaphorically came out of\r\ntheir shells and permitted an inspection. Above the railway I saw one of\r\nthe few birds of my entire Rocky Mountain outing that I was unable to\r\nidentify. That little feathered Sphinx--what could he have been? To\r\nquote from my note-book, \"His song, as he sits quietly on a twig in a\r\npine tree, is a rich gurgling trill, slightly like that of a house-wren,\r\nbut fuller and more melodious, with an air about it that makes me feel\r\nalmost like writing a poem. The bird is in plain view before me, and I\r\nmay watch him either with or without my glass; he has a short, conical\r\nbill; his upper parts are gray or olive-gray; cervical patch of a\r\ngreenish tinge; under parts whitish, spotted with dusk or brown. The\r\nbill is white or horn-color, and is quite heavy, I should say heavier\r\nthan that of any sparrow I know. The bird continued to sing for a long\r\ntime and at frequent intervals, not even stopping when the engine near\r\nat hand blew off steam, although he turned his head and looked a little\r\nstartled.\" I saw this species nowhere else in my Colorado rambles, and\r\ncan find no description in the systematic manuals that helps to clear up\r\nthe mystery, and so an _avis incognita_ he must remain for the present.\r\n\r\nHas mention been made of a few house-finches that were seen in\r\nGeorgetown? Only a few, however, for they prefer the towns and cities of\r\nthe plain. Several house-wrens were also seen in the vicinity of the\r\nGeorgetown Loop as well as elsewhere in the valley. The \"Loop,\" although\r\na monumental work of human genius and daring, has its peculiar\r\nattractions for the student of natural history, for in the cañon itself,\r\nwhich is somewhat open and not without bushy haunts, and on the\r\nprecipitous mountain sides, a few birds set up their Lares and Penates,\r\nand mingle their songs of domestic felicity with the roar of the torrent\r\nand the passing trains. Darting like zigzag lightning about the cliffs,\r\nthe broad-tailed humming-bird cuts the air with his sharp, defiant buzz,\r\nuntil you exclaim with the poet:\r\n\r\n    \"Is it a monster bee,\r\n      Or is it a midget bird,\r\n    Or yet an air-born mystery\r\n      That now yon marigold has stirred?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Solo singing in the thrush realm_\"]\r\n\r\nAmong the birds that dwell on the steep mountain sides above the \"Loop\"\r\nhollow are the melodious green-tailed towhees, lisping their chansons of\r\ngood-will to breeze and torrent, while in the copse of asps in the\r\nhollow itself the warbling vireo and the western flycatcher hold sway,\r\nthe former rehearsing his recitative all the day long, and the latter\r\nchirping his protest at every human intrusion. On a pine-clad shelf\r\nbetween the second fold of the \"Loop\" and what is known as the \"Great\r\nFill\" I settled (at least, to my own satisfaction) a long-disputed\r\npoint in regard to the vocalization of the mountain hermit thrush.\r\nAgain and again I had noticed a peculiarity about the hermit's\r\nminstrelsy--whenever the music reached my ear, it came in two runs, the\r\nfirst quite high in the scale, the second perhaps an octave lower. For a\r\nlong time I supposed that two thrushes were singing responsively, but\r\nhere at the \"Loop,\" after listening for a couple of hours, it occurred\r\nto me as improbable that there would invariably be a respondent when a\r\nthrush lifted up his voice in song. Surely there would sometimes, at\r\nleast, be solo singing in the thrush realm. And so the conclusion was\r\nforced upon me that both strains emanated from the same throat, that\r\neach vocalist was its own respondent. It was worth while to clamber\r\nlaboriously about the \"Loop\" to settle a point like that--at all events,\r\nit was worth while for one admirer of the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHO! FOR GRAY'S PEAK!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI\r\n\r\nTOWNSEND'S SOLITAIRE--_Myiadestes townsendii_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the uninitiated it may be regarded simply as fun and pastime to climb\r\na mountain whose summit soars into cloudland; in reality it is serious\r\nbusiness, not necessarily accompanied with great danger, but always\r\naccomplished by laborious effort. However, it is better for the\r\nclamberer to look upon his undertaking as play rather than work. Should\r\nhe come to feel that it is actual toil, he might soon weary of a task\r\nengaged in so largely for its own sake, and decide to expend his time\r\nand energy in something that would \"pay better.\" Moreover, if he is\r\nimpelled by a hobby--ornithology, for instance--in addition to the mere\r\nlove of mountaineering, he will find that something very near akin to\r\nwings has been annexed to the climbing gear of which he is naturally\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThe morning of June 27 saw my youthful companion and myself mounted each\r\nupon a shaggy burro, scrambling up the steep hill above Georgetown, en\r\nroute for Gray's Peak, the ascent of which was the chief goal of our\r\nambition in coming to the Rockies on the present expedition. The\r\ndistance from Georgetown to the summit of this peak is fourteen miles,\r\nand the crest itself is fourteen thousand four hundred and forty-one\r\nfeet above sea-level, almost three hundred feet higher than Pike's Peak,\r\nand cannot be scaled by means of a cog-wheel railway or any other\r\ncontrivance that uses steam or electricity as a motor. Indeed, the only\r\nmotor available at the time of our ascent--that is, for the final\r\nclimb--was \"shank's horses,\" very useful and mostly safe, even if a\r\nlittle plebeian. We had been wise enough not to plunge at once among the\r\nheights, having spent almost a week rambling over the plains, mesas,\r\nfoothills, and lower ranges, then had been occupied for five or six days\r\nmore in exploring the valleys and mountain sides in the vicinity of\r\nGeorgetown, and thus, by gradually approaching them, we had become\r\ninured to \"roughing it\" in the higher altitudes when we reached them,\r\nand suffered no ill effects from the rarefied atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe passed the famous \"Georgetown Loop,\" crept at a snail's pace--for\r\nthat is the natural gait of the burro--through the town of Silver Plume,\r\nand pursued our leisurely journey toward the beckoning, snow-clad\r\nheights beyond. No, we did not hurry, for two reasons: First, our\r\nlittle four-footers would not or could not quicken their pace, urge them\r\nas we would; second, we desired to name all the birds along the route,\r\nand that \"without a gun,\" as Emerson mercifully enjoins.\r\n\r\nHave you ever ridden a burro? Have you ever been astride of an old one,\r\na hirsute, unkempt, snail-paced, obstinate one, which thinks he knows\r\nbetter what gait he ought to assume than you do? If you have not, I\r\nventure to suggest modestly that your education and moral discipline are\r\nnot quite complete. The pair which we had hired were slow and headstrong\r\nenough to develop the patience of Job in a most satisfactory way, and to\r\ntest it, too. They were as homely as the proverbial \"mud fence\" is\r\nsupposed to be. Never having seen a fence of that kind, I speak with\r\nsome degree of caution, not wanting to cast any disparagement upon\r\nsomething of which I have so little knowledge. If our long-eared\r\ncompanions had ever seen a curry-comb, it must have been in the days of\r\nNoah. You see, we were \"tenderfoots,\" as far as having had any\r\nexperience with burros was concerned, or we might have selected a more\r\nsprightly pair for our fellow-pilgrims. A fine picture, fit for the\r\ncamera or the artist's brush, we presented as we crept with the speed of\r\na tortoise along the steep mountain roads and trails. Our \"jacks,\" as\r\nMessrs. Longears are called colloquially, were not lazy--oh, no! they\r\nwere simply averse to leaving home! Their domestic ties were so strong\r\nthey bound them with cords of steel and hooks of iron to stall and\r\nstable-yard! The thought of forsaking friends and kindred even for only\r\na few days wrung their loving hearts with anguish! No wonder we had a\r\ndelicate and pathetic task on hand when we attempted to start our\r\ncaravan up the mountain road. From side to side the gentle animals\r\nwabbled, their load of grief weighing them down tenfold more than the\r\nloads on their backs, and times without count they were prompted to veer\r\nabout and \"turn again home.\"\r\n\r\nMuch labor and time and patience were expended in persuading our steeds\r\nto crawl up the hill, but I am delighted to say that no profane history\r\nwas quoted, as we were a strictly moral crowd. At length we arrived in\r\nstate at the village of Silver Plume. Canter into the town like a gang\r\nof border ruffians we did not; we entered deliberately, as became a\r\ndignified company of travellers. But here a new difficulty confronted\r\nus, stared us blankly in the face. Our little charges could not be\r\nconvinced that there was any occasion for going farther than the town.\r\nThey seemed to have conscientious scruples about the matter; so they\r\nstopped without any invitation from their riders, sidled off, turned in\r\ntoward the residences, stores, groceries, shoe-shops, drugstores, barns,\r\nand even the saloons, the while the idlers on the streets and the small\r\nboys were gawking at us, smiling in a half-suppressed way, and making\r\nquaint remarks in which we could see no wisdom nor humor. We had not\r\ncome into the town, like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, merely to furnish\r\nthe villagers amusement. Applying our canes and straps forcibly to the\r\nhaunches and rumps of our burros only seemed to embarrass the poor\r\ncreatures, for you can readily see how they would reason the matter out\r\nfrom their own premises: If they were to go no farther, as had been\r\ndecided by themselves, why should their riders belabor them in that\r\nmerciless way? For downright dialectics commend me to the Rocky Mountain\r\nburro.\r\n\r\nFinally a providence in the shape of two small boys came to our rescue,\r\nand in a most interesting and effective way. Seeing the predicament we\r\nwere in, and appreciating the gravity of the situation, those\r\nnimble-witted lads picked up a couple of clubs from the street, and,\r\ngetting in the rear of our champing steeds, began to pound them over the\r\nhaunches. For small boys they delivered sturdy blows. Now, if there is\r\nanything that will make a burro move dexterously out of his tracks, it\r\nis to get behind him with a club and beat a steady tattoo on his hams\r\nand legs. No sooner did the boys begin to apply their clubs in good\r\nearnest than our burros began to print tracks in quick succession on the\r\ndusty road, and we went gayly through the town, the lads making a merry\r\ndin with their shouts and whacks, mingled with the patter of hoofs on\r\nthe street. It was so dramatic that even the women came to their doors\r\nto witness the pageant. We tried not to laugh, and so did the delicately\r\nmannered spectators, but I suspect that a good deal of laughing was done\r\non the sly, in spite of the canons of etiquette.\r\n\r\nAt length the obliging lads became a little too accommodating. They used\r\ntheir persuasives upon the donkeys so vigorously that they--the\r\ndonkeys--started off on a lope, a sort of awkward, lop-sided gallop.\r\nNow, if there is anything that is beyond the ability of Master Jack,\r\nespecially if he is old, it is to canter and at the same time preserve\r\nhis equilibrium. It is evident that he is not built to make a\r\nrocking-chair of his back bone. So a little comedy was enacted, all\r\ninvoluntary on the part of the _dramatis personæ_. Suddenly\r\nTurpentine--that was the name of the little gray burro ridden by my boy\r\ncompanion--took a header, sending his youthful rider sprawling to the\r\nground, where he did not remain a moment longer than good manners\r\ndemanded. Fortunately he succeeded in disengaging his feet from the\r\nstirrups and directing his movements in such a way that the animal did\r\nnot fall upon him. But poor Turpentine, what of him? He tumbled clean\r\nover his head upon his back, and I want to confess in all candor that\r\none of the most instructive and interesting \"animal pictures\" I have\r\never seen, including those done by Landseer, Rosa Bonheur, and Ernest\r\nThompson Seton, was that little iron-gray, long-eared donkey lying on\r\nhis back on the street and clawing the air with his hoofs. And he clawed\r\nfast, too--fairly sawed the air. For once in his life Turpentine, the\r\nsnail paced, was in a hurry; for once he moved with more celerity than\r\ngrace. It threw us into spasms of laughter to see him exert himself so\r\nvigorously to reverse his position--to get his feet down and his back\r\nup. A cat could not have done it with more celerity. You never would\r\nhave believed him capable of putting so much vim and vigor into his\r\neasy-going personality. After chopping the air with his hoofs for a\r\nsecond or two, he succeeded in righting himself, and was on his feet in\r\nless time than it takes to tell it. There he stood, as meek as Mary's\r\nlamb, trying to look as if he had never turned an undignified somersault\r\nin all his tranquil life.\r\n\r\nWe started on our journey again, and presently, to our intense relief,\r\nreached the border of the town, thanked the lads who had expedited our\r\nmarch along the street, and proceeded on our way up the valley. We soon\r\nsettled down to taking our burros philosophically, and erelong they were\r\ngoing calmly on the even tenor of their way, and afterwards we had\r\nlittle trouble with them, and actually became quite attached to the\r\ngentle creatures before our joint pilgrimage drew to an end.\r\n\r\nIt is time to pass from quadrupeds to bipeds. While our feathered\r\nfriends were not so abundant in the wilder regions as we might have\r\nwished, still we had almost constant avian companionship along the way.\r\nThe warbling vireos were especially plentiful, and in full tune, making\r\na silvery trail of song beside the dusty road. We had them at our elbow\r\nas far as Graymont, where we made a sharp detour from the open valley,\r\nand clambered along a steep mountain side, with a deep, wooded gorge\r\nbelow us. Here the vireos suddenly decided that they could escort us no\r\nfarther, as they had no taste for crepuscular cañons and alpine heights.\r\nNot a vireo was seen above Graymont, which has an altitude of nearly ten\r\nthousand feet. We left them singing in the valley as we turned from it,\r\nand did not hear them again until we came back to Graymont.\r\n\r\nAlmost the same may be said of the broad-tailed humming-birds, whose\r\ninsect-like buzzing we heard at frequent intervals along the route to a\r\nshoulder of the mountain a little above Graymont, when it suddenly\r\nceased and was heard no more until we returned to the same spot a few\r\ndays later. House-wrens, willow thrushes, Brewer's blackbirds, and\r\nlong-crested jays were also last seen at Graymont, which seemed to be a\r\nkind of territorial limit for a number of species.\r\n\r\nHowever, several species--as species, of course, not as\r\nindividuals--convoyed us all the way from Georgetown to the timber-line\r\nand, in some instances, beyond. Let me call the roll of these faithful\r\n\"steadies\": Mountain hermit thrushes, gray-headed juncos, red-shafted\r\nflickers, pine siskins, western robins, Audubon's and Wilson's warblers,\r\nmountain bluebirds and white-crowned sparrows. Of course, it must be\r\nborne in mind that these birds were not seen everywhere along the upward\r\njourney, simply in their favorite habitats. The deep, pine-shadowed\r\ngorges were avoided by the warblers and white-crowned sparrows, whilst\r\nevery open, sunlit, and bushy spot or bosky glen was enlivened by a\r\ncontingent of these merry minnesingers. One little bird added to our\r\nlist in the gorge above Graymont was the mountain chickadee, which was\r\nfound thereafter up to the timber-line.\r\n\r\nIt was sometime in the afternoon when we reached Graymont, which we\r\nfound to be no \"mount\" at all, as we had expected, but a hamlet, now\r\nmostly deserted, in a narrow valley in sight of several gray mountains\r\nlooming in the distance. Straight up the valley were some snow-mantled\r\npeaks, but none of them was Gray's; they did not beckon to us from the\r\nright direction. From the upper part of the hamlet, looking to our left,\r\nwe saw a frowning, snow-clad ridge towering like an angry giant in the\r\nair, and we cried simultaneously, \"Gray's Peak!\" The terrific aspect of\r\nthat mountain sent a momentary shiver through our veins as we thought of\r\nscaling it without a guide. We were in error, as we afterwards found,\r\nfor the mountain was Torrey's Peak, not Gray's, which is not visible\r\nfrom Graymont, being hidden by two intervening elevations, Mount Kelso\r\nand Torrey's Peak. There are several points about a mile above Graymont\r\nfrom which Gray's serene peak is visible, but of this we were not aware\r\nuntil on our return trip, when we had learned to recognize him by his\r\ncalm and magisterial aspect.\r\n\r\nAs evening drew on, and the westering sun fell below the ridges, and the\r\nshadows deepened in the gorges, making them doubly weird, we began to\r\nfeel very lonely, and, to add to our misgivings, we were uncertain of\r\nour way. The prospect of having to spend a cold night out of doors in a\r\nsolitary place like this was not very refreshing, I am free to confess,\r\nmuch as one might desire to proclaim himself a brave man. Presently our\r\neyes were gladdened by the sight of a miner's shack just across the\r\nhollow, perhaps the one for which we were anxiously looking. A man at\r\nGraymont had told us about a miner up this way, saying he was a \"nice\r\nman\" and would no doubt give us accommodation for the night. I crossed\r\nthe narrow foot-bridge that spanned the booming torrent, and found the\r\nminer at home. Would he give two way-worn travellers a place to sleep\r\nbeneath his roof? We had brought plenty of food and some blankets with\r\nus, and all we required was four walls around us and a roof over our\r\nheads. Yes, he replied, we were welcome to such accommodation as he had,\r\nand he could even give us a bed, though it \"wasn't very stylish.\" Those\r\nwere among the sweetest and most musical words that ever fell on my ear.\r\n\r\nHaving tethered our burros in a grassy cove on the mountain side, and\r\ncooked our supper in the gloaming among some rocks by the bank of the\r\nbrawling stream, we turned into the cabin for the night, more than\r\ngrateful for a shelter from the chill winds scurrying down from the\r\nsnow-capped mountains. The shack nestled at the foot of Mount Kelso,\r\nwhich we had also mistaken for Gray's Peak. As we sat by the light of a\r\ntallow candle, beguiling the evening with conversation, the miner told\r\nus that the mountain jays, colloquially called \"camp robbers,\" were\r\ncommon around his cabin, especially in winter; but familiar as they\r\nwere, he had never been able to find a nest. The one thing about which\r\nthey insist on the utmost privacy is their nesting places. My friend\r\nalso told me that a couple of gray squirrels made the woods around his\r\ncamp their home. The jays would frequently carry morsels of food up to\r\nthe branches of the pines, and stow them in some crevice for future use,\r\nwhereupon the squirrels, always on the lookout for their own interests,\r\nwould scuttle up the tree and steal the hidden provender, eating it with\r\nmany a chuckle of self-congratulation.\r\n\r\nHad not the weather turned so cold during the night, we might have slept\r\nquite comfortably in the miner's shack, but I must confess that, though\r\nit was the twenty-eighth of June and I had a small mountain of cover\r\nover me, I shivered a good deal toward morning. An hour or so after\r\ndaylight four or five mountain jays came to the cabin for their\r\nbreakfast, flitting to the ground and greedily devouring such tidbits as\r\nthey could find. They were not in the least shy. But where were their\r\nnests? That was the question that most deeply interested me. During the\r\nnext few days I made many a long and toilsome search for them in the\r\nwoods and ravines and on the steep mountain sides, but none of the birds\r\ninvited me to their houses. These birds know how to keep a secret.\r\nAnything but feathered Apollos, they have a kind of ghoulish aspect,\r\nmaking you think of the apparitional as they move in their noiseless way\r\namong the shadowing pines. There is a look in their dark, deep-set eyes\r\nand about their thick, clumpy heads which gives you a feeling that they\r\nmight be equal to any imaginable act of cruelty. Yet I cannot say I\r\ndislike these mountain roustabouts, for some of their talk among\r\nthemselves is very tender and affectionate, proving that, \"whatever\r\nbrawls disturb the street,\" there are love and concord in jay household\r\ncircles. That surely is a virtue to be commended, and cannot be claimed\r\nfor every family, either avian or human.\r\n\r\nAt 4.30 that morning I crept out of bed and climbed far up one of the\r\nmountain sides--this was before the jays came to the cabin. The wind\r\nblew so icy from the snow-clad heights that I was only too glad to wear\r\nwoollen gloves and pin a bandanna handkerchief around my neck, besides\r\nbuttoning up my coat collar. Even then I shivered. But would you believe\r\nit? The mosquitoes were as lively and active as if a balmy breeze were\r\nblowing from Arcady, puncturing me wherever they could find a vulnerable\r\nspot, and even thrusting their sabres through my thick woollen gloves\r\ninto the flesh. They must be extremely hardy insects, for I am sure such\r\narctic weather would send the mosquitoes of our lower altitudes into\r\ntheir winter hiding-places. People who think there are no mosquitoes in\r\nthe Rockies are reckoning without their hosts. In many places they\r\nassaulted us by the myriad until life among them became intolerable, and\r\nsome were found even in the neighborhood of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nRaw as the morning was, the hermit thrushes, mountain chickadees,\r\nAudubon's warblers, gray-headed juncos, and ruby-crowned kinglets were\r\ngiving a lively rehearsal. How shy they were! They preferred being\r\nheard, not seen. Unexpectedly I found a hermit thrush's nest set in\r\nplain sight in a pine bush. One would have thought so shy a bird would\r\nmake some attempt at concealment. It was a well-constructed domicile,\r\ncomposed of grass, twigs, and moss, but without mortar. The shy owner\r\nwas nowhere to be seen, nor did she make any outcry, even though I stood\r\nfor some minutes close to her nest. What stolidity the mountain birds\r\ndisplay! You could actually rob the nests of some of them without\r\nwringing a chirp from them. On two later visits to the place I found\r\nMadame Thrush on her nest, where she sat until I came quite close, when\r\nshe silently flitted away and ensconced herself among the pines, never\r\nchirping a syllable of protest or fear. In the bottom of the pretty crib\r\nlay four deep-blue eggs. Afterwards I found one more hermit's nest,\r\nwhich was just in process of construction. In this case, as in the\r\nfirst, no effort was made at concealment, the nest being placed in the\r\ncrotch of a quaking asp a rod or so above the trail, from which it could\r\nbe plainly seen. The little madame was carrying a load of timbers to her\r\ncottage as we went down the trail, and sat in the nest moulding and\r\nputting her material in place as I climbed up the steep bank to inspect\r\nher work. Then she flew away, making no demonstration while I examined\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\nHaving eaten our breakfast at the miner's cabin, my youthful companion\r\nand I mounted our \"gayly caparisoned steeds,\" and resumed our journey\r\ntoward Gray's Peak. The birds just mentioned greeted us with their\r\nsalvos as we crept along. It was not until we had almost reached the\r\ntimber-line that Gray's Peak loomed in sight, solemn and majestic,\r\nphotographed against the cobalt sky, with its companion-piece, Torrey's\r\nPeak, standing sullen beside it. The twin peaks were pointed out to us\r\nby another miner whom we met at his shack just a little below the\r\ntimber-line, and who obligingly gave us permission to \"bunk\" in one of\r\nthe cabins of what is known as \"Stephen's mine,\" which is now\r\nabandoned--or was at the time of our visit. Near the timber-line, where\r\nthe valley opens to the sunlight, we found a mountain bluebird flitting\r\nabout some old, deserted buildings, but, strangely enough, this was the\r\nlast time we saw him, although we looked for him again and again. Nor\r\ndid we see another mountain blue in this alpine eyrie.\r\n\r\nOur burros were tethered for the day in a grassy hollow, our effects\r\nstowed away in the cabin aforesaid, which we had leased for a few days;\r\nthen, with luncheon strapped over our shoulders and butterfly net and\r\nfield-glass in hand, we started happily up the valley afoot toward the\r\nsummit of our aspirations, Gray's Peak, rising fourteen thousand four\r\nhundred and forty-one feet above the level of the sea. In some scrubby\r\npine bushes above timber-line several Audubon's warblers were flitting\r\nand singing, living hard by the white fields of snow. Still farther up\r\nthe hollow Wilson's warblers were trilling blithely, proclaiming\r\nthemselves yet more venturesome than their gorgeous cousins, the\r\nAudubons. There is reason for this difference, for Wilson's warblers\r\nnest in willows and other bushes which thrive on higher ground and\r\nnearer the snowy zone than do the pines to which Audubon's warblers are\r\nespecially attached. At all events, _Sylvania pusilla_ was one of the\r\ntwo species which accompanied us all the way from Georgetown to the foot\r\nof Gray's Peak, giving us a kind of \"personally conducted\" journey.\r\n\r\nOur other brave escorts were the white-crowned sparrows, which pursued\r\nthe narrowing valleys until they were merged into the snowy gorges that\r\nrive the sides of the towering twin peaks. In the arctic gulches the\r\nscrubby copses came to an end, and therefore the white-crowns ascended\r\nno higher, for they are, in a pre-eminent sense, \"birds of the bush.\"\r\nSubsequently I found them as far up the sides of Mount Kelso as the\r\nthickets extended, which was hundreds of feet higher than the snow-bound\r\ngorges just mentioned, for Kelso receives more sunshine than his taller\r\ncompanions, particularly on his eastern side. Brave birds are these\r\nhandsome and musical sparrows. It was interesting to see them hopping\r\nabout on the snow-fields, picking up dainties from the white crystals.\r\nHow lyrical they were in this upper mountain valley! As has been said,\r\nfor some unaccountable reason the white-crowns in the vicinity of\r\nGeorgetown were quite chary of their music. Not so those that dwelt in\r\nthe valley below Gray's and Torrey's peaks, for there they trilled their\r\nmelodious measures with a richness and abandon that were enchanting.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the snow-belt, though still a little below the limit of\r\ncopsy growths, we saw our first pipits, which, it will be remembered, I\r\nhad encountered on the summit of Pike's Peak two years before. In our\r\nclimb up Gray's Peak we found the pipit realm and that of the\r\nwhite-crowned sparrows slightly overlapping. As soon, however, as we\r\nbegan the steep climb above the matted copses, the white-crowns\r\ndisappeared and the pipits grew more abundant. At frequent intervals\r\nthese birds would suddenly start up from the ground, utter their\r\nprotesting \"Te-cheer! te-cheer!\" and hurl themselves recklessly across a\r\nsnowy gulch, or dart high into the air and let their semi-musical calls\r\ndrop and dribble from the turquoise depths of the sky. Did the pipits\r\naccompany you to the summit of the peak? I half regret to admit that\r\nthey did not, but ceased to appear a good while before the summit was\r\nattained. This is all the more remarkable when it is remembered that\r\nthese birds were extremely abundant on the crest of Pike's Peak, where\r\nthey behaved in a \"very-much-at-home\" way.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was ample compensation in the ascent of Gray's Peak. As\r\nwe clambered up the steep and rugged side of the mountain, sometimes\r\nwading snow up to our knees, then making a short cut straight up the\r\nacclivity to avoid the snow-banks, unable to follow the trail a large\r\npart of the way, we were suddenly made aware of the presence of another\r\nfearless feathered comrade. With a chirp that was the very quintessence\r\nof good cheer and lightness of heart, he hopped about on the snow,\r\npicking dainties from his immaculate tablecloth, and permitting us to\r\napproach him quite close before he thought it worth while to take to\r\nwing. We were happy indeed to meet so companionable a little friend, one\r\nthat, amid these lonely and awe-inspiring heights, seemed to feel so\r\nmuch at ease and exhibited so confiding a disposition. Was it fancy or\r\nwas it really true? He appeared to be giving us a hospitable welcome to\r\nhis alpine home, telling us we might venture upward into cloudland or\r\nskyland without peril; then, to make good his assurance, he mounted\r\nupward on resilient wings to prove how little danger there was. We were\r\ndoubly glad for our little seer, for just then we needed someone to\r\n\"prophesy smooth things\" to us. The bird was the brown-capped\r\nleucosticte or rosy finch. Thus far I have used the singular number, but\r\nthe plural would have been more accurate, for there were many of these\r\nfinches on the acclivity and summit, all of them in a most cheerful\r\nmood, their good will and cordial welcome giving us a pleasant feeling\r\nof comradery as we journeyed together up the mountain side.\r\n\r\nOur climb up Gray's Peak was a somewhat memorable event in our\r\nexperience, and I am disposed to dwell upon it. The valley which we had\r\nfollowed terminates in a deep gorge, filled with drift snow the year\r\nround, no doubt, and wedging itself between Gray's and Torrey's\r\nshoulders and peaks. Here the melting snows form the head waters of\r\nClear Creek, whose sinuous course we had followed by rail, foot, and\r\nburro from the city of Denver.\r\n\r\nThe trail, leaving the ravine, meandered up a shoulder of the mountain,\r\nwheeled to the left and crept along a ridge, with some fine,\r\nblood-curdling abysses on the eastern side; then went zigzagging back\r\nand forth on the precipitous wall of Gray's titanic mount, until at\r\nlast, with a long pull and a strong pull, it scaled the backbone of the\r\nridge. All this, however, is much more easily told than done. Later in\r\nthe season, when the trail is clear of snow-drifts, sure-footed horses\r\nand burros are ridden to the summit; but we were too early to follow the\r\ntrail even on foot. Indeed, many persons familiar with the mountains had\r\ndeclared that we could not reach the top so early in the season, on\r\naccount of the large snow-banks that still covered the trail. Even the\r\nold miner, who in the valley below pointed out the peak to us,\r\nexpressed grave doubts about the success and wisdom of our undertaking.\r\n\"See!\" he said, \"the trail's covered with snow in many places on the\r\nmountain side. I'm afraid you can't reach the top, sir.\" I did not see\r\nas clearly as he did, but said nothing aloud. In my mind I shouted,\r\n\"Excelsior!\" and then added, mentally, of course, \"Faint heart never won\r\nfair lady or fairer mountain's crest--hurrah for the peak!\" I simply\r\nfelt that if there were birds and butterflies on that sky-aspiring\r\ntower, I _must_ see them. The die was cast; we had come to Colorado\r\nexpressly to climb Gray's Peak, and climb it we would, or have some good\r\nreason to give for not doing so.\r\n\r\nAnd now we were making the attempt. We had scarcely reached the\r\nmountain's shoulder before we were obliged to wade snow. For quite a\r\ndistance we were able to creep along the edge of the trail, or skirt the\r\nsnow-beds by making short detours, and then returning to the trail; but\r\nby and by we came to a wide, gleaming snow-field that stretched right\r\nathwart our path and brought us to a standstill with the exclamation,\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" Having already sunk a number of times into the\r\nsnow over our boot-tops, we felt that it would not be safe to venture\r\nacross so large an area of soft and treacherous crystals melting in the\r\nafternoon sun and only slightly covering we knew not what deep gorges.\r\nIn some places we had been able to walk on the top of the snow, but\r\nelsewhere it was quite soft, and we could hear the gurgling of water\r\nunderneath, and sometimes it sounded a little more sepulchral than we\r\nliked. Looking far up the acclivity, we saw still larger snow-fields\r\nobliterating the trail. \"We can never cross those snow-fields,\" one of\r\nus declared, a good deal of doubt in his tones. A moment's reflection\r\nfollowed, and then the other exclaimed stoutly, \"Let us climb straight\r\nup, then!\" To which his companion replied, \"All right, little Corporal!\r\nBeyond the Alps lies Italy!\"\r\n\r\nOver rocks and stones and stretches of gravel, sometimes loose,\r\nsometimes solid, we clambered, half the time on all fours, skirting the\r\nsnow-fields that lay in our unblazed pathway; on and up, each cheering\r\nthe other at frequent intervals by crying lustily, \"We can make it! We\r\ncan make it!\" ever and anon throwing ourselves on the rocks to recover\r\nour breath and rest our aching limbs; on and up we scrambled and crept,\r\nlike ants on a wall, until at length, reaching the ridge at the left a\r\nlittle below the top, we again struck the trail, when we stopped a few\r\nminutes to catch breath, made one more mighty effort, and, behold! we\r\nstood on Gray's summit, looking down triumphantly at the world crouching\r\nat our feet. Never before had we felt so much like Jupiter on Olympus.\r\n\r\n_GRAY'S AND TORREY'S PEAKS_\r\n\r\n_Gray's to the left, Torrey's to the right. As the lookout of the\r\nphotographer was nearer Torrey's than Gray's, the former appears the\r\nhigher in the picture, while the reverse is really the case. The trail\r\nwinds through a ravine at the right of the ridge in front; then creeps\r\nalong the farther side of the ridge above the gorge at Torrey's base;\r\ncomes to the crest of the ridge pretty well toward the left; then crawls\r\nand zigzags back and forth along the titanic wall of Gray's to the\r\nsummit. In the vale, where some of the head waters of Clear Creek will\r\nbe seen, the white-crowned sparrows and Wilson's warblers find homes. A\r\nlittle before the ascent of the ridge begins, the first pipits are seen;\r\nthence the clamberer has pipit company to the point where the ridge\r\njoins the main bulk of the mountain. Here the pipits stop, and the first\r\nleucostictes are noted, which, chirping cheerily all the way, escort the\r\ntraveller to the summit._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn making the ascent, some persons, even among those who ride, become\r\nsick; others suffer with bleeding at the nose, and others are so\r\novercome with exhaustion and weakness that they cannot enjoy the superb\r\npanorama spread out before them. However you may account for it, my\r\nyouthful comrade and I, in spite of our arduous climb, were in excellent\r\nphysical condition when we reached our goal, suffering no pain whatever\r\nin eyes, head, or lungs. The bracing air, rare as it was, soon\r\nexhilarated us, our temporary weariness disappeared, and we were in the\r\nbest of trim for scouring the summit, pursuing our natural history\r\nhobbies, and revelling in the inspiring cyclorama that Nature had reared\r\nfor our delectation.\r\n\r\nMy pen falters when I think of describing the scene that broke upon our\r\nvision. I sigh and wish the task were done. The summit itself is a\r\nnarrow ridge on which you may stand and look down the declivities on\r\nboth sides, scarcely having to step out of your tracks to do so. It is\r\nquite different from the top of Pike's Peak, which is a comparatively\r\nlevel plateau several acres in extent, carpeted, if one may so speak,\r\nwith immense granite rocks piled upon one another or laid side by side\r\nin semi-systematic order; whereas Gray's, as has been said, is a narrow\r\nridge, composed chiefly of comparatively small stones, with a sprinkling\r\nof good-sized boulders. The finer rocks give the impression of having\r\nbeen ground down by crushing and attrition to their present dimensions\r\nin the far-away, prehistoric ages.\r\n\r\nA short distance to the northwest frowned Torrey's Peak, Gray's\r\ncompanion-piece, the twain being connected by a ridge which dips in an\r\narc perhaps a hundred feet below the summits. The ridge was covered with\r\na deep drift of snow, looking as frigid and unyielding as a scene in the\r\narctic regions. Torrey's is only a few feet lower than Gray's--one of my\r\nbooks says five. Mention has been made of its forbidding aspect. It is\r\nindeed one of the most ferocious-looking mountains in the Rockies, its\r\ncrown pointed and grim, helmeted with snow, its sides, especially east\r\nand north, seamed and ridged and jagged, the gorges filled with snow,\r\nthe beetling cliffs jutting dark and threatening, bearing huge drifts\r\nupon their shoulders. Torrey's Peak actually seemed to be calling over\r\nto us like some boastful Hercules, \"Ah, ha! you have climbed my\r\nmild-tempered brother, but I dare you to climb me!\" For reasons of our\r\nown we declined the challenge.\r\n\r\nThe panorama from Gray's Peak is one to inspire awe and dwell forever in\r\nthe memory, an alpine wonderland indeed and in truth. To the north,\r\nnorthwest, and west there stretches, as far as the eye can reach, a vast\r\nwilderness of snowy peaks and ranges, many of them with a rosy glow in\r\nthe sunshine, tier upon tier, terrace above terrace, here in serried\r\nranks, there in isolated grandeur, some just beyond the dividing\r\ncañons, others fifty, sixty, a hundred miles away, cyclopean, majestic,\r\ninfinite. Far to the north, Long's Peak lifts his seamed and hoary\r\npyramid, almost as high as the crest on which we are standing; in the\r\nwest rise that famous triad of peaks, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton,\r\ntheir fanelike towers, sketched against the sky, disputing the palm with\r\nold Gray himself; while a hundred miles to the south Pike's Peak stands\r\nsolitary and smiling in the sun, seeming to say, \"I am sufficient unto\r\nmyself!\" Between our viewpoint and the last-named mountain lies South\r\nPark, like a paradise of green immured by guardian walls of rock and\r\nsnow, and far to the east, beyond the billowing ranges, white, gray, and\r\ngreen, stretch the limitless plains, vanishing in the hazy distance. In\r\nsuch surroundings one's breast throbs and swells with the thought of\r\nNature's omnipotence.\r\n\r\n_PANORAMA FROM GRAY'S PEAK--NORTHWEST_\r\n\r\n_The picture includes the northern spur of Gray's Peak, with the\r\ndismantled signal station on its crest. The main ridge of the peak\r\nextends out to the left of the signal station. The summit is so situated\r\nas to be exposed to the sun the greater part of the day; hence, although\r\nit is the highest point in the region, there is less snow upon it in\r\nsummer than upon many of the surrounding elevations. Looking northwest\r\nfrom the signal station, the eye falls upon a wilderness of snow-clad\r\npeaks and ranges, some standing in serried ranks, others in picturesque\r\ndisorder. It is truly an arctic scene, summer or winter. Yet it is the\r\nsummer home of the brown-capped leucosticte and the white-tailed\r\nptarmigan, which range in happy freedom over the upper story of our\r\ncountry._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe summit of Gray's Peak is a favorable viewpoint from which to study\r\nthe complexion, the idiosyncrasies, if you please, of individual\r\nmountains, each of which seems to have a personality of its own. Here is\r\nGray's Peak itself, calm, smiling, good-natured as a summer morning;\r\nyonder is Torrey's, next-door neighbor, cruel, relentless, defiant,\r\nalways threatening with cyclone or tornado, or forging the thunder-bolts\r\nof Vulcan. Some mountains appear grand and dignified, others look like\r\nspitfires. On one side some bear smooth and green slopes almost to the\r\ntop, while the other is scarred, craggy, and precipitous.\r\n\r\nThe day was serene and beautiful, the sky a deep indigo, unflecked with\r\nclouds, save a few filmy wracks here and there, and the breeze as balmy\r\nas that of a May morning in my native State. So quiet was the alpine\r\nsolitude that on all sides we could hear the solemn roar of the streams\r\nin the ravines hundreds of feet below, some of them in one key and some\r\nin another, making almost a symphony. For several hours we tarried, held\r\nby a spell. \"But you have forgotten your ornithology!\" some one reminds\r\nme. No one could blame me if I had. Such, however, is not the case, for\r\nornithology, like the poor, is never far from some of us. The genial\r\nlittle optimists that had been hopping about on the snow on the\r\ndeclivities had acted as our cicerones clear to the summit, and some of\r\nthem remained there while we tarried. Indeed the leucostictes were quite\r\nplentiful on the mountain's brow. Several perched on the dismantled\r\nwalls of the abandoned government building on the summit, called\r\ncheerily, then wheeled about over the crest, darted out and went\r\ncareering over the gulches with perfect aplomb, while we watched them\r\nwith envious eyes, wishing we too had wings like a leucosticte, not that\r\nwe \"might fly away,\" as the Psalmist longed to do, but that we might\r\nscale the mountains at our own sweet will. The favorite occupation of\r\nour little comrades, besides flying, was hopping about on the snow and\r\npicking up dainties that were evidently palatable. Afterwards we\r\nexamined the snow, and found several kinds of small beetles and other\r\ninsects creeping up through it or about on its surface. Without doubt\r\nthese were leucosticte's choice morsels. Thus Nature spreads her table\r\neverywhere with loving care for her feathered children. The general\r\nhabits of the rosy finches are elsewhere depicted in this volume. It\r\nonly remains to be said that they were much more abundant and familiar\r\non Gray's Peak than on Pike's Peak,--that is, at the time of my\r\nrespective visits to those summits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Thistle Butterfly_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Western White_]\r\n\r\nTo omit all mention of the butterflies seen on this trip would be proof\r\nof avian monomania with a vengeance. The lad who was with me found a\r\nnumber of individuals of two species zigzagging over the summit, and\r\noccasionally settling upon the rocks right by the fields of snow. What\r\nkind of nectar they sipped I know not, for there were no flowers or\r\nverdure on the heights. They were the Painted Lady or Thistle Butterfly\r\n(_Pyrameis cardui_) and the Western White (_Pieris occidentalis_). He\r\ncaptured an individual of the latter species with his net, and to-day it\r\ngraces his collection, a memento of a hard but glorious climb. The\r\ndescent of the mountain was laborious and protracted, including some\r\nfloundering in the snow, but was accomplished without accident. A warm\r\nsupper in the miner's shack which we had leased prepared us for the\r\nrestful slumbers of the night.\r\n\r\nAlthough the weather was so cold that a thin coating of ice was formed\r\non still water out of doors, the next morning the white-crowned sparrows\r\nwere singing their sonatas long before dawn, and when at peep of day I\r\nstepped outside, they were flitting about the cabins as if in search of\r\ntheir breakfast. The evening before, I left the stable-door open while I\r\nwent to bring the burros up from their grazing plat. When I returned\r\nwith the animals, a white-crown flew out of the building just as I\r\nstepped into the entrance, almost fluttering against my feet, and\r\nchirping sharply at what he seemed to think a narrow escape. He had\r\ndoubtless gone into the stable on a foraging expedition.\r\n\r\nThe day was spent in exploring the valley and steep mountain sides. A\r\nrobin's nest was found a little below the timber-line on the slope of\r\nMount Kelso. In the woods a short distance farther down, a gray-headed\r\njunco's nest was discovered after a good deal of patient waiting. A\r\nfemale was preening her feathers on a small pine-tree, a sure sign that\r\nshe had recently come from brooding her eggs. Presently she began to\r\nflit about from the tree to the ground and back again, making many\r\nfeints and starts, which proved that she was embarrassed by my\r\nespionage; but at last she disappeared and did not return. With\r\nquickened pulse I approached the place where I had last seen her. It was\r\nnot long before she flew up with a nervous chirp, revealing a pretty\r\ndomicile under a roof of green grass, with four daintily speckled eggs\r\non the concave floor. I noticed especially that the doorway of the tiny\r\ncottage was open toward the morning sun.\r\n\r\nAt the timber-line there were ruby-crowned kinglets, mountain\r\nchickadees, and gray-headed juncos, while far above this wavering\r\nboundary a pair of red-shafted flickers were observed ambling about\r\namong the bushes and watching me as intently as I was watching them. I\r\nclimbed far up the side of Mount Kelso, then around its rocky shoulder,\r\nfollowing an old trail that led to several abandoned silver mines, but\r\nno new birds rewarded my toilsome quest, although I was pleased to learn\r\nthat the pipits and leucostictes did not give the \"go-by\" to this grand\r\nold mountain, but performed their thrilling calisthenics in the air\r\nabout its slopes and ravines with as much grace as they did on the\r\nloftier mountain peaks the day before. A beautiful fox and three cubs\r\nwere seen among the large stones, and many mountain rats and a sly mink\r\nwent scuttling about over the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Junco_\r\n\r\n\"_Under a roof of green grass_\"]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 30 the white-crowns, as usual, were chanting\r\ntheir litanies long before day broke. We left the enchanting valley that\r\nmorning, the trills of the white-crowns ringing in the alpenglow like a\r\nsad farewell, as if they felt that we should never meet again. On our\r\nway down the winding road we frequently turned to gaze with longing\r\neyes upon the snowy summits of the twin peaks, Gray's all asmile in the\r\nsunshine, and Torrey's--or did we only imagine it?--relenting a little\r\nnow that he was looking upon us for the last time. Did the mountains and\r\nthe white-crowns call after us, \"Auf wiedersehen!\" or was that only\r\nimagination too?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASANT OUTINGS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII\r\n\r\nRUDDY DUCK--_Erismatura rubida_\r\n(Lower figure, male; upper, female)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our pleasantest trips was taken up South Platte Cañon, across\r\nSouth Park, and over the range to Breckenridge. The town lies in the\r\nvalley of the Blue River, the famous Ten Mile Range, with its numerous\r\npeaks and bold and rugged contour, standing sentinel on the west. Here\r\nwe found many birds, but as few of them were new, I need not stop to\r\nenter into special detail.\r\n\r\nAt the border of the town I found my first green-tailed towhee's nest,\r\nwhich will be described in the last chapter. A pair of mountain\r\nbluebirds had snuggled their nest in a cranny of one of the cottages,\r\nand an entire family of blues were found on the pine-clad slope beyond\r\nthe stream; white-crowned sparrows were plentiful in the copses and far\r\nup the bushy ravines and mountain sides; western chippies rang their\r\nsilvery peals; violet-green swallows wove their invisible fabrics\r\noverhead; juncos and Audubon's warblers proclaimed their presence in\r\nmany a remote ingle by their little trills; and Brewer's blackbirds\r\n\"chacked\" their remonstrance at every intrusion into their demesnes;\r\nwhile in many a woodsy or bushy spot the long-crested jays rent the air\r\nwith their raucous outcries; nor were the broad-tailed hummers wanting\r\non this side of the range, and of course their saucy buzzing was heard\r\nwherever they darted through the air.\r\n\r\nAn entire day was spent in ascending and descending Peak Number Eight,\r\none of the boldest of the jutting crags of the Ten Mile Range; otherwise\r\nit is called Tillie Ann, in honor of the first white woman known to\r\nscale its steep and rugged wall to the summit. She must have been a\r\nbrave and hardy woman, and certainly deserves a monument of some kind in\r\nmemory of her achievement, although it falls to the lot of few persons\r\nto have their deeds celebrated by a towering mountain for a memorial.\r\nWhile not as high by at least a thousand feet as Gray's Peak, it was\r\nfully as difficult of access. A high ridge of snow, which we surmounted\r\nwith not a little pride and exhilaration, lay on its eastern acclivity\r\nwithin a few feet of the crest, a white crystalline bank gleaming in the\r\nsun. The winds hurtling over the summit were as cold and fierce as old\r\nBoreas himself, so that I was glad to wear woollen gloves and button my\r\ncoat-collar close around my neck; yet it was the Fourth of July, when\r\nthe people of the East were sweltering in the intense heat of their low\r\naltitudes. It was a surprise to us to find the wind so much colder here\r\nthan it had been on the twenty-eighth of June on the summit of Gray's\r\nPeak, which is considerably farther north. However, there may be times\r\nwhen the meteorological conditions of the two peaks are reversed,\r\nblowing a gale on Gray's and whispering a zephyr on Tillie Ann.\r\n\r\nThe usual succession of birds was seen as we toiled up the slopes and\r\nsteep inclines, some stopping at the timber-line and others extending\r\ntheir range far up toward the alpine zone. In the pine belt below the\r\ntimber-line a pair of solitaires were observed flitting about on the\r\nground and the lower branches of the trees, but vouchsafing no song. In\r\nthe same woodland the mountain jays held carnival--a bacchanalian revel,\r\njudging from the noise they made; the ruby-crowned kinglets piped their\r\ngalloping roundels; a number of wood-pewees--western species--were\r\nscreeching, thinking themselves musical; siskins were flitting about,\r\nthough not as numerous as they had been in the piny regions below Gray's\r\nPeak; and here for the first time I saw olive-sided flycatchers among\r\nthe mountains. I find by consulting Professor Cooke that their breeding\r\nrange is from seven thousand to twelve thousand feet. A few juncos and\r\nruby-crowned kinglets were seen above the timber-line, while many\r\nwhite-crowned sparrows, some of them singing blithely, climbed as far up\r\nthe mountain side as the stunted copses extended.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, no leucostictes were seen on this peak. Why they should\r\nmake their homes on Pike's and Gray's Peaks and neglect Tillie Ann is\r\nanother of those puzzles in featherdom that cannot be solved. Must a\r\npeak be over fourteen thousand feet above sea-level to meet their\r\nphysiological wants in the summery season? Who can tell? There were\r\npipits on this range, but, for some reason that was doubtless\r\nsatisfactory to themselves, they were much shyer than their brothers and\r\nsisters had been on Gray's Peak and Mount Kelso; more than that, they\r\nwere seen only on the slopes of the range, none of them being observed\r\non the crest itself, perhaps on account of the cold, strong gale that\r\nwas blowing across the snowy heights. A nighthawk was sailing in its\r\nerratic course over the peaks--a bit of information worth noting, none\r\nof these birds having been seen on any of the summits fourteen thousand\r\nfeet high. These matters are perhaps not of supreme interest, yet they\r\nhave their value as studies in comparative ornithology and are helpful\r\nin determining the _locale_ of the several species named. In the same\r\ninterest I desire to add that mountain chickadees, hermit thrushes,\r\nwarbling vireos, and red-shafted flickers belong to my Breckenridge\r\nlist. Besides, what I think must have been a Mexican crossbill was seen\r\none morning among the pines, and also a large hawk and two kinds of\r\nwoodpeckers, none of which tarried long enough to permit me to make\r\nsure of their identity. The crossbill--if the individual seen was a bird\r\nof that species--wore a reddish jacket, explored the pine cones, and\r\nsang a very respectable song somewhat on the grosbeak order, quite\r\nblithe, loud, and cheerful.\r\n\r\nOn our return trip to Denver we stopped for a couple of days at the\r\nquiet village of Jefferson in South Park, and we shall never cease to be\r\nthankful that our good fairies led us to do so. What birds, think you,\r\nfind residence in a green, well-watered park over nine thousand feet\r\nabove sea-level, hemmed in by towering, snow-clad mountains? Spread out\r\naround you like a cyclorama lies the plateau as you descend the mountain\r\nside from Kenosha Pass; or wheel around a lofty spur of Mount Boreas,\r\nand you almost feel as if you must be entering Paradise. It was the\r\nfifth of July, and the park had donned its holiday attire, the meadows\r\nwearing robes of emerald, dappled here and there with garden spots of\r\nvariegated flowers that brought more than one exclamation of delight\r\nfrom our lips.\r\n\r\n_SOUTH PARK FROM KENOSHA HILL_\r\n\r\n_A paradise of green engirdled by snow-mantled mountains, making a\r\nsummer home for western meadow-larks, Brewer's blackbirds, desert horned\r\nlarks, and western Savanna sparrows._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the village, our attention was called to a colony of\r\ncliff-swallows, the first we had seen in our touring among the\r\nmountains. Against the bare wall beneath the eaves of a barn they had\r\nplastered their adobe, bottle-shaped domiciles, hundreds of them, some\r\nin orderly rows, others in promiscuous clusters. At dusk, when we\r\nreturned to the village, the birds were going to bed, and it was\r\ninteresting to watch their method of retiring. The young were already\r\ngrown, and the entire colony were converting their nests into sleeping\r\nberths, every one of them occupied, some of the partly demolished ones\r\nby two and three birds. But there were not enough couches to go round,\r\nand several of the birds were crowded out, and were clinging to the side\r\nof the wall on some of the protuberances left from their broken-down\r\nclay huts. It was a query in my mind whether they could sleep\r\ncomfortably in that strained position, but I left them to settle that\r\nmatter for themselves and in their own way.\r\n\r\nLeaving the town, we soon found that the irrigated meadows and\r\nbush-fringed banks of the stream made habitats precisely to the taste of\r\nBrewer's blackbirds, which were quite plentiful in the park. My\r\ncompanion was \"in clover,\" for numerous butterflies went undulating over\r\nthe meadows, leading him many a headlong chase, but frequently getting\r\nthemselves captured in his net. Thus occupied, he left me to attend to\r\nthe birds. At the border of the village a little bird that was new to me\r\nflitted into view and permitted me to identify it with my glass. The\r\nlittle stranger was the western savanna sparrow. South Park was the only\r\nplace in my Colorado rambles where I found this species, and even his\r\neastern representative is known to me very imperfectly and only as a\r\nmigrant. The park was fairly alive with savannas, especially in the\r\nirrigated portions. I wonder how many millions of them dwelt in this\r\nvast Eden of green almost twice as large as the State of Connecticut!\r\nThe little cocks were incessant singers, their favorite perches being\r\nthe wire fences, or weeds and grass tufts in the pastures. Their voices\r\nare weak, but very sweet, and almost as fine as the sibilant buzz of\r\ncertain kinds of insects. The pretty song opens with two or three\r\nsomewhat prolonged syllables, running quite high, followed by a trill\r\nmuch lower in the scale, and closes with a very fine, double-toned\r\nstrain, delivered with the rising inflection and a kind of twist or\r\njerk--\"as if,\" say my notes, \"the little lyrist were trying to tie a\r\nknot in his aria before letting it go.\" More will be said about these\r\ncharming birds before the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe western meadow-larks were abundant in the park, delivering with\r\ngreat gusto their queer, percussive chants, which, according to my\r\nnotes, \"so often sound as if the birds were trying to crack the whip.\"\r\nThe park was the only place above the plains and mesas where I found\r\nthese gifted fluters, with the exception of the park about Buena Vista.\r\nIt would appear that the narrow mountain valleys, green and grassy\r\nthough they are, do not appeal to the larks for summer homes; no, they\r\nseem to crave \"ampler realms and spaces\" in which to spread their wings\r\nand chant their dithyrambs.\r\n\r\nWhere the natural streams and irrigating ditches do not reach the soil\r\nof the park it is as dry and parched as the plains and mesas. In fact,\r\nthe park is only a smaller and higher edition of the plains, the\r\ncharacter of the soil and the topography of the land in both regions\r\nbeing identical. Never in the wet, fresh meadows, whether of plain or\r\npark, only on the arid slopes and hillocks, will you find the desert\r\nhorned larks, which are certainly true to their literary cognomen, if\r\never birds were. How they revel in the desert! How scrupulously they\r\ndraw the line on the moist and emerald areas! Surely there are \"many\r\nbirds of many kinds,\" and one might appropriately add, \"of many minds,\"\r\nas well; for, while the blackbirds and savanna sparrows eschew the\r\ndesert, the horned larks show the same dislike for the meadow. In\r\nshallow pits dug by themselves amid the sparse buffalo grass, the larks\r\nset their nests. The young had already left their nurseries at the time\r\nof my visit to the park, but were still receiving their rations from the\r\nbeaks of their elders. On a level spot an adult male with an uncommonly\r\nstrong voice for this species was hopping about on the ground and\r\nreciting his canticles. Seeing I was a stranger and evidently interested\r\nin all sorts of avian exploits, he decided to give an exhibition of what\r\nmight be called sky-soloing, as well as dirigible ballooning. Starting\r\nup obliquely from the ground, he continued to ascend in a series of\r\nupward leaps, making a kind of aerial stairway, up, up, on and up, until\r\nhe was about the size of a humming-bird framed against the blue dome of\r\nthe sky. So far did he plunge into the cerulean depths that I could just\r\ndiscern the movement of his wings. While scaling the air he did not\r\nsing, but having reached the proper altitude, he opened his mandibles\r\nand let his ditty filtrate through the ether like a shower of spray. It\r\ncould be heard quite plainly, although at best the lark's song is a\r\nweak, indefinite twitter, its peculiar characteristic being its carrying\r\nquality, which is indeed remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe soloist circled around and around in the upper air so long that I\r\ngrew dizzy watching him, and my eyes became blinded by the sun and the\r\nglittering sky. How long he kept up his aerial evolutions, singing all\r\nthe while, I am unprepared to announce, for I was too much engrossed in\r\nwatching him to consult my timepiece; but the performance lasted so long\r\nthat I was finally obliged to throw myself on my back on the ground to\r\nrelieve the strain upon me, so that I might continue to follow his\r\nmovements. I venture the conjecture that the show lasted from fifteen to\r\ntwenty minutes; at least, it seemed that long to me in my tense state of\r\nbody and mind. Finally he shot down like an arrow, making my head fairly\r\nwhirl, and landed lightly on the ground, where he skipped about and\r\nresumed his roundelay as if he had not performed an extraordinary feat.\r\nThis was certainly skylarking in a most literal sense. With the\r\nexception of a similar exhibition by Townsend's solitaire--to be\r\ndescribed in the closing chapter--up in the neighborhood of Gray's Peak,\r\nit was the most wonderful avian aeronautic exploit, accompanied with\r\nsong, of which I have ever been witness. It is odd, too, that a bird\r\nwhich is so much of a groundling--I use the term in a good sense, of\r\ncourse--should also be so expert a sky-scraper. I had listened to the\r\nsky song of the desert horned lark out on the plain, but there he did\r\nnot hover long in the air.\r\n\r\nThe killdeer plovers are as noisy in the park as they are in an eastern\r\npasture-field, and almost as plentiful. In the evening near the village\r\na pair of western robins and a thieving magpie had a hard tussle along\r\nthe fence of the road. The freebooter was carrying something in his beak\r\nwhich looked sadly like a callow nestling. He tried to hide in the\r\nfence-corners, to give himself a chance to eat his morsel, but they were\r\nhot on his trail, and at length he flew off toward the distant ridge.\r\nWhere did the robins build their nests? I saw no trees in the\r\nneighborhood, but no doubt they built their adobe huts on a fence-rail\r\nor in a nook about an old building. Not a Say's phoebe had we thus far\r\nseen on this jaunt to the mountains, but here was a family near the\r\nvillage, and, sure enough, they were whistling their likely tunes, the\r\nfirst time I had ever heard them. While I had met with these birds at\r\nGlenwood and in the valley below Leadville, they had not vouchsafed a\r\nsong. What is the tune they whistle? Why, to be sure, it is, \"Phe-be-e!\r\nphe-be-e! phe-e-e-bie!\" Their voices are stronger and more mellifluent\r\nthan the eastern phoebe's, but the manner of delivery is not so\r\nsprightly and gladsome. Indeed, if I mistake not, there is a pensive\r\nstrain in the lay of the western bird.\r\n\r\nA few cowbirds, red-winged blackbirds, and spotted sandpipers were seen\r\nin the park, but they are too familiar to merit more than casual\r\nmention. However, let us return to Brewer's blackbirds. Closely as they\r\nresemble the bronzed grackles of the East, there are some marked\r\ndifferences between the eastern and western birds; the westerners are\r\nnot so large, and their manners and nesting habits are more like those\r\nof the red-wings than the grackles. Brewer's blackbirds hover overhead\r\nas you come into the neighborhood of their nests or young, and the males\r\nutter their caveats in short squeals or screeches and the females in\r\nharsh \"chacks.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Magpie and Western Robins_\r\n\r\n\"_They were hot on his trail_\"]\r\n\r\nThe nests are set in low bushes and even on the ground, while those of\r\nthe grackles are built in trees and sometimes in cavities. To be exact\r\nand scientific, Brewer's blackbirds belong to the genus _Icolecophagus_,\r\nand the grackles to the genus _Quiscalus_. In the breeding season the\r\nwestern birds remain in the park. That critical period over, in August\r\nand September large flocks of them, including young and old, ascend to\r\nfavorite feeding haunts far above the timber-line, ranging over the\r\nslopes of the snowy mountains engirdling their summer home. Then they\r\nare in the heyday of blackbird life. Silverspot himself, made famous by\r\nErnest Thompson Seton, did not lead a more romantic and adventurous\r\nlife, and I hope some day Brewer's blackbird will be honored by a no\r\nless effective biography.\r\n\r\nWhat a to-do they make when you approach their outdoor hatchery! Yet\r\nthey are sly and diplomatic. One day I tried my best to find a nest with\r\neggs or bantlings in it, but failed, although, as a slight compensation,\r\nI succeeded in discovering three nests from which the young had flown.\r\nThe old birds of both sexes circled overhead, called and pleaded and\r\nscolded, and sometimes swooped down quite close to my scalp, always\r\nveering off in time to avoid actual collision. A pair of them held\r\nchoice morsels--choice for Brewer's blackbirds--in their bills, and I\r\nsat down on a tuft of sod and watched them for a couple of hours, hoping\r\nthey would feed their young in plain sight and divulge their secret to\r\nme; but the sable strategists flitted here and there, hovered in the\r\nair, dropped to the ground, visiting every bush and grass-tuft but the\r\nright one, and finally the worms held in their bills disappeared,\r\nwhether into their own gullets or those of their fledgelings, I could\r\nnot tell. If the latter, the rascals were unconscionably wary, for my\r\neyes were bent on them every moment--at least, I thought so. Again and\r\nagain they flew off some distance, never more than a stone's throw,\r\nstrutted about for a few minutes among the tufts of grass and sod, then\r\ncame back with loud objurgations to the place where I sat. They seemed\r\nto be aware of my inspection the moment my field-glass was turned upon\r\nthem, for they would at once cease their pretended search for insects in\r\nthe grass and fly toward me with a clamorous berating giving me a big\r\npiece of their mind. At length my patience was worn out; I began to hunt\r\nfor nests, and found the three empty abodes to which allusion has been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the female cried, \"Chack! chack!\" but occasionally she\r\ntried to screech like her ebon consort, her voice breaking ludicrously\r\nin the unfeminine effort. The evening before, I had flushed a youngster\r\nabout which a great hubbub was being made, but on the day of my long\r\nvigil in the meadow, I could not, by the most careful search, find a\r\nsingle bantling, either in or out of a nest. It is odd how effectually\r\nthe young are able to conceal themselves in the short grass and\r\nstraggling bushes.\r\n\r\nNot a little attention was given to the western savanna sparrows, whose\r\nsongs have already been described. Abundant proof was furnished that the\r\nbreeding season for these little birds was at its height, and I\r\ndetermined to find a nest, if within the range of possibility. An entire\r\nforenoon was spent in discovering three nests. As you approach their\r\ndomiciles, the cocks, which are always on the alert, evidently give the\r\nalarm to their sitting mates, which thereupon slip surreptitiously from\r\nthe nest; and in that case how are you going to ferret out their\r\ndomestic secrets?\r\n\r\nA female--I could distinguish her from her consort by her conduct--was\r\nsitting on the post of a wire fence, preening her feathers, which was\r\nsufficient evidence that she had just come from brooding her eggs. To\r\nwatch her until she went back to her nest, then make a bee-line for\r\nit--that was the plan I resolved to pursue. It is an expedient that\r\nsucceeds with many birds, if the observer is very quiet and tactful. For\r\na long time I stood in the blazing sun with my eyes bent on the little\r\nimpostor. Back and forth, hither and yon, she flew, now descending to\r\nthe ground and creeping slyly about in the grass, manifestly to induce\r\nme to examine the spot; then back to the fence again, chirping\r\nexcitedly; then down at another place, employing every artifice to make\r\nme think the nest was where it was not; but I steadfastly refused to\r\nbudge from my tracks as long as she came up in a few moments after\r\ndescending, for in that case I knew that she was simply resorting to a\r\nruse to lead me astray. Finally she went down at a point which she had\r\npreviously avoided, and, as it was evident she was becoming exceedingly\r\nanxious to go back upon her eggs, I watched her like a tiger intent on\r\nhis prey. Slyly she crept about in the grass, presently her chirping\r\nceased, and she disappeared.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes passed, and she did not come up, so I felt sure she had\r\ngone down for good this time, and was sitting on her nest. Her husband\r\nexerted himself to his utmost to beguile my attention with his choicest\r\narias, but no amount of finesse would now turn me from my purpose. I\r\nmade a bee-line for the spot where I had last seen the madame, stopping\r\nnot, nor veering aside for water, mud, bushes, or any other obstacle. A\r\nsearch of a couple of minutes brought no find, for she had employed all\r\nthe strategy of which she was mistress in going to the nest, having\r\nmoused along in the grass for some distance after I had last seen her. I\r\nmade my search in an ever-widening circle, and at length espied some dry\r\ngrass spears in a tuft right at my feet; then the little prospective\r\nmother flitted from her nest and went trailing on the ground, feigning\r\nto be fatally wounded.\r\n\r\nAcquainted with such tactics, I did not follow her, not even with my\r\neye, but looked down at my feet. Ah! the water sprites had been kind,\r\nfor there was the dainty crib, set on a high tuft of sod raised by the\r\nwinter's frosts, a little island castle in the wet marsh, cosey and dry.\r\nIt was my first savanna sparrow's nest, whether eastern or western. The\r\nminiature cottage was placed under a fragment of dried cattle excrement,\r\nwhich made a slant roof over it, protecting it from the hot rays of the\r\nsun. Sunken slightly into the ground, the nest's rim was flush with the\r\nshort grass, while the longer stems rose about it in a green, filmy wall\r\nor stockade. The holdings of the pretty cup were four pearls of eggs,\r\nthe ground color white, the smaller end and middle peppered finely with\r\nbrown, the larger almost solidly washed with pigment of the same tint.\r\n\r\nTwo more savannas' nests were found not long afterwards, one of them by\r\nwatching the female until she settled, the other by accidentally\r\nflushing her as I walked across the marshy pasture; but neither of them\r\nwas placed under a roof as the first one had been, the blue dome being\r\ntheir only shelter. These birdlets seem to be especially fond of soggy\r\nplaces in pastures, setting their nests on the little sod towers that\r\nrise above the surrounding water.\r\n\r\nAll the birds seen in the park have now been mentioned. It was an\r\nidyllic spot, and I have often regretted that I did not spend a week in\r\nrambling over it and making excursions to the engirdling ridges and\r\npeaks. A few suggestive questions arise relative to the migratory habits\r\nof the feathered tenants of a mountain park like this, for most of those\r\nthat have been named are only summer residents. How do they reach this\r\nimmured Eden at the time of the spring migration? One may conjecture and\r\nspeculate, but one cannot be absolutely sure of the precise course of\r\ntheir annual pilgrimage to their summer Mecca. Of course, they come up\r\nfrom the plains, where the spring arrives much earlier than it does in\r\nthe higher altitudes. Our nomads may ascend by easy stages along the few\r\ncañons and valleys leading up from the plains to this mountain-girt\r\nplateau; or else, rising high in air at eventide--for most birds perform\r\ntheir migrations at night--they may fly over the passes and mountain\r\ntops, and at dawn descend to the park.\r\n\r\nNeither of these hypotheses is free from objection, for, on the one\r\nhand, it is not likely that birds, which cannot see in the dark, would\r\ntake the risk of dashing their brains out against the cliffs and crags\r\nof the cañons by following them at night; yet they may depart from their\r\nusual habit of nocturnal migration, and make the journey up the gorges\r\nand vales by day. On the other hand, the nights are so cold in the\r\nelevated regions that the little travellers' lives might be jeopardized\r\nby nocturnal flight over the passes and peaks. There is one thing\r\ncertain about the whole question, perplexing as it may be--the feathered\r\npilgrims reach their summer quarters in some way, and seem to be very\r\nhappy while they remain.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at a number of places in our run down South Platte Cañon,\r\nadding no new birds to our list, but making some interesting\r\nobservations. At Cassel's a house-wren had built a nest on the veranda\r\nof the hotel where people were sitting or passing most of the time, and\r\nwas feeding her tiny brood. In the copse of the hollow below the resort,\r\nthe mountain song-sparrows were trilling sweetly--the only ones we had\r\nencountered in our wanderings since leaving Arvada on the plains. These\r\nmusicians seem to be rather finical in their choice of summer resorts.\r\nChaseville is about a mile below Cassel's, and was made memorable to us\r\nby the discovery of our second green-tailed towhee's nest, a description\r\nof which I have decided to reserve for the last chapter of this volume.\r\nLincoln's sparrows descanted in rich tones at various places in the\r\nbushy vales, but were always as wild as deer, scuttling into the\r\nthickets before a fair view of them could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe veranda of a boarding-house at Shawnee was the site of another\r\nhouse-wren's nest. While I stood quite close watching the little mother,\r\nshe fed her bantlings twice without a quaver of fear, the youngsters\r\nchirping loudly for more of \"that good dinner.\" At this place barn\r\nswallows were describing graceful circles and loops in the air, and a\r\nsheeny violet-green swallow squatted on the dusty road and took a\r\nsun-bath, which she did by fluffing up all her plumes and spreading out\r\nher wings and tail, so that the rays could reach every feather with\r\ntheir grateful warmth and light. It was a pretty performance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Violet-green Swallow_\r\n\r\n\"_Squatted on the dusty road and took a sun-bath_\"]\r\n\r\nA stop-over at Bailey's proved satisfactory for several reasons, among\r\nwhich was the finding of the Louisiana tanagers, which were the first we\r\nhad seen on this trip, although many of them had been observed in the\r\nlatitude of Colorado Springs. Afterwards we found them abundant in the\r\nneighborhood of Boulder. The only pigmy nuthatches of this visit were\r\nseen in a ravine above Bailey's. In the same wooded hollow I took\r\noccasion to make some special notes on the quaint calls of the\r\nlong-crested jays, a task that I had thus far deferred from time to\r\ntime. There was an entire family of jays in the ravine, the elders\r\nfeeding their strapping youngsters in the customary manner. These birds\r\nfrequently give voice to a strident call that is hard to distinguish\r\nfrom the cries of their kinsmen, the mountain jays. When I pursued the\r\ncouple that were attending to the gastronomical wants of their children,\r\none of the adults played a yodel on his trombone sounding like this:\r\n\"Ka-ka-ka, k-wilt, k-wilt, k-wilt\", the first three short syllables\r\nenunciated rapidly, and the \"k-wilts\" in a more measured way, with a\r\npeculiar guttural intonation, giving the full sound to the _k_ and _w_.\r\nThe birds became very shy when they thought themselves shadowed, not\r\nunderstanding what my pursuit might imply, and they gave utterance to\r\nharsh cries of warning that were different from any that had preceded.\r\nIt was presently followed by a soft and friendly chatter, as if the\r\nbirds were having an interview that was exclusively _inter se_. Then one\r\nof them startled me by breaking out in a loud, high key, crying, \"Quick!\r\nquick! quick!\" as fast as he could fling the syllables from his tongue.\r\nThis, being translated into our human vernacular, obviously meant,\r\n\"Hurry off! danger! danger!\" A few minutes of silence followed the\r\noutburst, while the birds ambled farther away, and then the echoes were\r\nroused by a most raucous call, \"Go-ware! go-ware! go-ware!\" in a voice\r\nthat would have been enough to strike terror to the heart of one who was\r\nnot used to uncanny sounds in solitary places. After that outburst the\r\nfamily flew off, and I could hear them talking the matter over among\r\nthemselves far up the mountain side, no doubt congratulating one another\r\non their hair-breadth escape. The youngsters looked quite stylish with\r\ntheir quaint little blue caps and neatly fitting knickerbockers.\r\n\r\nAt Bailey's I found my first and only white-crowned sparrow's nest for\r\nthis trip, although two years before I was fortunate enough to discover\r\nseveral nests in the valleys creeping from the foot of Pike's Peak. At\r\ndusk one evening I was walking along the railway below the village,\r\nlistening to the sweetly pensive trills of the white-crowns in the\r\nbushes bordering the creek, when there was a sharp chirp in the willows,\r\nand a female white-crown darted over to my side of the stream and\r\nslipped quietly into a thick bush on the bank. I stepped down to the\r\nspot, and the pretty madame leaped away, uncovering a well-woven nest\r\ncontaining four white eggs speckled with dark brown. All the while her\r\nspouse was trilling with might and main on the other side of the creek,\r\nto make believe that there was nothing serious happening, no nest that\r\nany one cared anything about. His mate could not disguise her agitation\r\nby assuming nonchalance, but flitted about in the willows and chirped\r\npitifully. I hurried away to relieve her distress. The cottages on the\r\nslopes were gay with tourists enjoying their summer outing, and\r\nbeautiful Kiowa Lodge, perched on a shoulder of the mountain among\r\nembowering pines, glowed with incandescent lights, while its\r\nblithe-hearted guests pursued their chosen kinds of pastime; but none of\r\nthem, I venture to assert, were happier than the little white-crown in\r\nher grassy lodge on the bank of the murmuring stream.\r\n\r\nOn the way down the cañon, as we were going to Denver, I was able to add\r\nthree belted kingfishers to my bird-roll of Colorado species, the only\r\nones I saw in the Rockies.\r\n\r\nOur jaunt of 1901 included a trip to Boulder and a thrilling swing\r\naround the far-famed \"Switzerland Trail\" to Ward, perched on the\r\nmountain sides among the clouds hard by the timber-line. Almost\r\neverywhere we met with feathered comrades; in some places, especially\r\nabout Boulder, many of them; but no new species were seen, and no habits\r\nobserved that have not been sufficiently delineated in other parts of\r\nthis book. If one could only observe all the birds all the time in all\r\nplaces, what a happy life the bird-lover would live! It is with feelings\r\nof mingled joy and sadness that one cons Longfellow's melodious lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Think every morning when the sun peeps through\r\n      The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove,\r\n    How jubilant the happy birds renew\r\n      Their old, melodious madrigals of love!\r\n    And when you think of this, remember too\r\n      'Tis always morning somewhere, and above\r\n    The awakened continents, from shore to shore,\r\n    Somewhere the birds are singing evermore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOTABLE QUARTETTE[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the plains of Colorado there dwells a feathered choralist that\r\ndeserves a place in American bird literature, and the day will perhaps\r\ncome when his merits will have due recognition, and then he shall have\r\nnot only a monograph, but also an ode all to himself.\r\n\r\n    [12] The author is under special obligation to Mr. John P. Haines,\r\n    editor of \"Our Animal Friends,\" and president of the American\r\n    Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for publishing the\r\n    contents of this chapter in his magazine in time to be included in\r\n    this volume. Also for copyright privileges in connection with this\r\n    and other chapters.\r\n\r\nThe bird to which I refer is called the lark bunting in plain English,\r\nor, in scientific terms, _Calamospiza melanocorys_. The male is a trig\r\nand handsome fellow, giving you the impression of a well-dressed\r\ngentleman in his Sunday suit of black, \"with more or less of a slaty\r\ncast,\" as Ridgway puts it, the middle and greater wing-coverts bearing a\r\nconspicuous white patch which is both a diagnostic marking and a real\r\nornament. In flight this patch imparts to the wing a filmy, almost\r\nsemi-transparent, aspect. The bunting is about the size of the eastern\r\nbobolink, and bears some resemblance to that bird; but bobolink he is\r\nnot, although sometimes mistaken for one, and even called by that name\r\nin Colorado. The fact is, those wise men, the systematists, have decided\r\nthat the bobolink belongs to the family _Icteridæ_, which includes,\r\namong others, the blackbirds and orioles, while the lark bunting\r\noccupies a genus all by himself in the family _Fringillidæ_--that is,\r\nthe family of finches, sparrows, grosbeaks, and towhees. Therefore, the\r\ntwo birds can scarcely be called second cousins. The bunting has no\r\nwhite or buff on his upper parts.\r\n\r\nSitting on a sunny slope one June evening, I surrendered myself to the\r\nspell of the bunting, and endeavored to make an analysis of his\r\nminstrelsy. First, it must be said that he is as fond as the bobolink of\r\nrehearsing his arias on the wing, and that is, perhaps, the chief reason\r\nfor his having been mistaken for that bird by careless observers.\r\nProbably the major part of his solos are recited in flight, although he\r\ncan sit quietly on a weed-stalk or a fence-post and sing as sweetly, if\r\nnot as ecstatically, as if he were curveting in the air. During this\r\naerial performance he hovers gracefully, bending his wings downward,\r\nafter the bobolink's manner, as if he were caressing the earth beneath\r\nhim. However, a striking difference between his intermittent\r\nsong-flights and those of the bobolink is to be noted. The latter\r\nusually rises in the air, soars around in a curve, and returns to the\r\nperch from which he started, or to one near by, describing something of\r\nan ellipse. The lark bunting generally rises obliquely to a certain\r\npoint, then descends at about the same angle to another perch opposite\r\nthe starting-point, describing what might be called the upper sides of\r\nan isosceles triangle, the base being a line near the ground, connecting\r\nthe perch from which he rose and the one on which he alighted. I do not\r\nmean to say that our bunting never circles, but simply that such is not\r\nhis ordinary habit, while sweeping in a circle or ellipse is the\r\nfavorite pastime of the eastern bobolink. The ascent of neither bird is\r\nvery high. They are far from deserving the name of skylarks.\r\n\r\nWe must give a detailed account of the bunting's song. Whatever others\r\nmay think of him, I have come under the spell of his lyrical genius.\r\nTrue, his voice has not the loud, metallic ring, nor his chanson the\r\nmedley-like, happy-go-lucky execution, that marks the musical\r\nperformances of the bobolink; but his song is more mellow, rhythmic,\r\ntheme-like; for he has a distinct tune to sing, and sing it he will. In\r\nfine, his song is of a different order from that of the bobolink, and,\r\ntherefore, the comparison need be carried no further.\r\n\r\nAs one of these minstrels sat on a flowering weed and gave himself up\r\nto a lyrical transport, I made careful notes, and now give the substance\r\nof my elaborate entries. The song, which is intermittent, opens with\r\nthree prolonged notes running high in the scale, and is succeeded by a\r\nquaint, rattling trill of an indescribable character, not without\r\nmusical effect, which is followed by three double-toned long notes quite\r\ndifferent from the opening phrases; then the whole performance is closed\r\nby an exceedingly high and fine run like an insect's hum--so fine,\r\nindeed, that the auditor must be near at hand to notice it at all.\r\nSometimes the latter half of the score, including the second triad of\r\nlong notes, is repeated before the soloist stops to take breath. It will\r\nbe seen that the regular song consists of four distinct phrases, two\r\ntriads and two trills. About one-third of the songs are opened in a\r\nlittle lower key than the rest, the remainder being correspondingly\r\nmellowed. The opening syllables, and, indeed, some other parts of the\r\nmelody as well, are very like certain strains of the song-sparrow, both\r\nin execution and in quality of tone; and thus even the experienced\r\nornithologist may sometimes be led astray. When the bunting sails into\r\nthe air, he rehearses the song just described, only he is very likely to\r\nprolong it by repeating the various parts, though I think he seldom, if\r\never, throws them together in a hodge-podge. He seems to follow a system\r\nin his recitals, varied as many of them are. As to his voice, it is of\r\nsuperb timbre.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic noted was that the buntings do not throw back\r\ntheir heads while singing, after the manner of the sparrows, but stretch\r\ntheir necks forward, and at no time do they open their mouths widely. As\r\na rule, or at least very often, when flying, they do not begin their\r\nsongs until they have almost reached the apex of their triangle; then\r\nthe song begins, and it continues over the angle and down the incline\r\nuntil another perch is settled upon. What Lowell says of \"bobolinkum\" is\r\njust as true of bunting--\"He runs down, a brook o' laughter, thru the\r\nair.\" As the sun went down behind the snow-clad mountains, a half dozen\r\nor more of the buntings rolled up the full tide of song, and I left them\r\nto their vespers and trudged back to the village, satisfied with the\r\nacquirements of this red-letter day in my ornithological journey.\r\n\r\nHowever, one afternoon's study of such charming birds was not enough to\r\nsatisfy my curiosity, for no females had been seen and no nests\r\ndiscovered. About ten days later, more attention was given them. In a\r\nmeadow not far from the hamlet of Arvada, between Denver and the\r\nmountains, I found a colony of buntings one morning, swinging in the air\r\nand furnishing their full quota of the matutinal concert, in which many\r\nother birds had a leading part, among them being western meadow-larks,\r\nwestern robins, Bullock's orioles, American and Arkansas goldfinches,\r\nmountain song-sparrows, lazuli finches, spurred towhees, black-headed\r\ngrosbeaks, summer warblers, western Maryland yellow-throats, and\r\nTownsend's solitaires. It has seldom been my fortune to listen to a\r\nfiner _pot-pourri_ of avian music.\r\n\r\nAt first only male buntings were seen. Surely, I thought, there must be\r\nfemales in the neighborhood, for when male birds are singing so lustily\r\nabout a place, their spouses are usually sitting quietly on nests\r\nsomewhere in bush or tree or grass. I hunted long for a nest, trudging\r\nabout over the meadow, examining many a grass-tuft and weed-clump,\r\nhoping to flush a female and discover her secret; but my quest was vain.\r\nIt is strange how difficult it is to find nests in Colorado, either on\r\nthe plains or in the mountains. The birds seem to be adepts in the fine\r\narts of concealment and secret-keeping. Presently several females were\r\nseen flying off over the fields and returning, obviously to feed their\r\nyoung. There was now some colorable prospect of finding a nest. A mother\r\nbird appeared with a worm in her bill, and you may rely upon it I did\r\nnot permit her to slip from my sight until I saw her drop to the ground,\r\nhop about stealthily for a few moments, then disappear, and presently\r\nfly up minus the worm. Scarcely daring to breathe, I followed a direct\r\ncourse to the weed-clump from which she had risen. And there was a nest,\r\nsure enough--my first lark bunting's--set in a shallow pit of the\r\nground, prettily concealed and partly roofed over by the flat and\r\nspreading weed-stalk. Four half-fledged youngsters lay panting in the\r\nlittle cradle, the day being very warm. I lifted one of them from the\r\nnest, and held it in my hand for a minute or two, and even touched it\r\nwith my lips, my first view of lark-bunting babies being something of an\r\nevent--I had almost said an epoch--in my experience. Replacing the\r\nyoungster in its crib, I stepped back a short distance and watched the\r\nmother bird returning with another mouthful of \"goodies,\" and feeding\r\nher bantlings four. She was not very shy, and simply uttered a fine\r\nchirp when I went too close to her nestlings, while her gallant consort\r\ndid not even chirp, but tried to divert my attention by repeatedly\r\ncurveting in the air and singing his choicest measures. This was the\r\nonly bunting's nest I found, although I made long and diligent search\r\nfor others, as you may well believe when I state that a half day was\r\nspent in gathering the facts recorded in the last two paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I watched a female in another field for a long time,\r\nbut she was too wary to betray her secret. In this case the male,\r\ninstead of beguiling me with song, flitted about and mingled his fine\r\nchirps with those of his anxious mate. On my way across the plains,\r\nsome two weeks later, I discovered that the lark buntings do not dwell\r\nonly in well-watered meadows, but also in the most arid localities.\r\nStill, I am inclined to think they do not build their nests far from\r\nrefreshing streams. When the breeding season is over, they range far and\r\nwide over the plains in search of insects that are to their taste. From\r\nthe car window many of them were observed all along the way to a\r\ndistance of over sixty miles east of Denver. At that time the males,\r\nfemales, and young were moving from place to place, mostly in scattering\r\nflocks, the breeding season being past. A problem that puzzled me a\r\nlittle was where they obtain water for drinking and bathing purposes,\r\nbut no doubt such blithe and active birds are able to \"look out for\r\nnumber one.\"\r\n\r\nThe second member of our lyrical quartette is the elegant green-tailed\r\ntowhee, known scientifically as _Pipilo chlorurus_. The pretty\r\ngreen-tails are quite wary about divulging their domestic secrets, and\r\nfor a time I was almost in despair of finding even one of their nests.\r\nIn vain I explored with exhausting toil many a steep mountain side,\r\nexamining every bush and beating every copse within a radius of many\r\nrods.\r\n\r\nMy purpose was to flush the female from her nest, a plan that succeeds\r\nwith many birds; but in this instance I was disappointed. It is possible\r\nthat, when an intruder appears in their nesting haunts, the males,\r\nwhich are ever on the lookout, call their spouses from the nests, and\r\nthen \"snap their fingers,\" so to speak, at the puzzled searcher.\r\n\r\nHowever, by watching the mother birds carrying worms in their bills I\r\nsucceeded in finding two nests. The first was at Breckenridge, and,\r\ncuriously enough, in a vacant lot at the border of the town, not on a\r\nsteep slope, but on a level spot near the bank of Blue River. The mother\r\nbird had slyly crept to her nest while I watched, and remained firmly\r\nseated until I bent directly over her, when she fluttered away, trailing\r\na few feet to draw my attention to herself. It was a cosey nest site--in\r\na low, thick bush, beneath a rusty but well-preserved piece of\r\nsheet-iron which made a slant roof over the cradle. It contained three\r\ncallow bantlings, which innocently opened their carmine-lined mouths\r\nwhen I stirred the leaves above them. It seemed to be an odd location\r\nfor the nest of a bird that had always appeared so wild and shy. The\r\naltitude of the place is nine thousand five hundred and twenty feet.\r\n\r\nMy second green-tail's nest was in South Platte Cañon, near a station\r\ncalled Chaseville, its elevation being about eight thousand five hundred\r\nfeet. I was walking along the dusty wagon road winding about the base of\r\nthe mountain, when a little bird with a worm in her bill flitted up the\r\nsteep bank a short distance and disappeared among the bushes. The tidbit\r\nin her bill gave me a clew to the situation; so I scrambled up the steep\r\nplace, and presently espied a nest in a bush, about a foot and a half\r\nfrom the ground. As had been anticipated, it turned out to be a\r\ngreen-tailed towhee's domicile, as was proved by the presence and uneasy\r\nchirping of a pair of those birds. While the nest at Breckenridge was\r\nset on the ground, this one was placed on the twigs of thick bushes,\r\nshowing that these birds, like their eastern relatives, are fond of\r\ndiversity in selecting nesting places.\r\n\r\nThis nest contained four bantlings, already well fledged. My notes say\r\nthat their mouths were yellow-lined, and that the fleshy growths at the\r\ncorners of their bills were yellow. Does the lining of the juvenile\r\ngreen-tail's mouth change from red to yellow as he advances in age? My\r\nnotes certainly declare that the nestlings at Breckenridge had\r\ncarmine-lined mouths. For the present I cannot settle the question\r\neither affirmatively or negatively.\r\n\r\nHere I perpetrated a trick which I have ever since regretted. The\r\ntemptation to hold a baby green-tail in my hand and examine it closely\r\nwas so strong that, as carefully as I could, I drew one from its grassy\r\ncrib and held it in my palm, noting the green tinting already beginning\r\nto show on its wings and back. Its tail was still too stubby to display\r\nthe ornamentation that gives the species its popular name. So much was\r\nlearned, but at the expense of the little family's peace of mind. As I\r\nheld the bantling in my hand, the frightened mamma uttered a series of\r\npitiful calls that were new to my ears, consisting of two notes in a\r\nlow, complaining tone; it was more of an entreaty than a protest.\r\nAfterwards I heard the green-tails also give voice to a fine chirp\r\nalmost like that of a chipping sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe mother's call seemed to strike terror to the hearts of her infant\r\nbrood, for, as I attempted to put the baby back into its crib, all four\r\nyoungsters set up a loud to-do, and sprang, panic stricken, over the\r\nrim, tumbling, fluttering, and falling through the network of twigs to\r\nthe ground, a couple of them rolling a few feet down the dusty bank.\r\nAgain and again I caught them and put them back into the nest, but they\r\nwould not remain there, so I was compelled to leave them scrambling\r\nabout among the bushes and rocks. I felt like a buccaneer, a veritable\r\nCaptain Kidd. My sincere hope is that none of the birdkins came to grief\r\non account of their premature flight from the nest. The next morning old\r\nand young were chirping about the place as I passed, and I hurried away,\r\nfeeling sad that science and sentiment must sometimes come into\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nOne day in the latter part of June, as I was climbing the steep side of\r\na mesa in the neighborhood of Golden, my ear was greeted by a new style\r\nof bird music, which came lilting sweetly down to me from the height. It\r\nhad a kind of wild, challenging ring about it, as if the singer were\r\ndaring me to venture upon his demesne at my peril. A hard climb brought\r\nme at length within range of the little performer, who was blowing his\r\nHuon's horn from the pointed top of a large stone on the mesa's side. My\r\nfield-glass was soon fixed upon him, revealing a little bird with a long\r\nbeak, decurved at the end, a grayish-brown coat quite thickly barred and\r\nmottled on the wings and tail, and a vest of warm white finely sprinkled\r\nwith a dusky gray. A queer, shy, timid little thing he was. Afterwards I\r\nmet him often, but never succeeded in gaining his confidence or winning\r\na single concession from him. He was the rock wren (_Salpinctes\r\nobsoletus_)--a species that is unknown east of the Great Plains, one\r\nwell deserving a place in literature.\r\n\r\nI was especially impressed with his peculiar style of minstrelsy, so\r\ndifferent from anything I had ever heard in the bird realm. While the\r\nsong was characterized by much variety, it usually opened with two or\r\nthree loud, clear syllables, somewhat prolonged, sounding, as has been\r\nsaid, like a challenge, followed by a peculiar bubbling trill that\r\nseemed fairly to roll from the piper's tongue. Early one morning a few\r\ndays later I heard a brilliant vocalist descanting from the top of a\r\npump in a wide field among the foothills. How wildly his tones rang out\r\non the crisp morning air! I seemed to be suddenly transported to another\r\npart of the world, his style of music was so new, so foreign to my ear.\r\nMy pencilled notes say of this particular minstrel: \"Very musical--great\r\nvariety of notes--clear, loud, ringing--several runs slightly like\r\nCarolina's--others suggest Bewick's--but most of them _sui generis_.\"\r\n\r\nLet us return to the first rock wren I saw. He was exceedingly shy,\r\nscurrying off to a more distant perch--another stone--as I approached.\r\nSometimes he would run down among the bushes and rocks like a mouse,\r\nthen glide to the top of another stone, and fling his pert little aria\r\nat the intruder. It was interesting to note that he most frequently\r\nselected for a singing perch the top of a high, pointed rock where he\r\ncould command a view of his surroundings and pipe a note of warning to\r\nhis mate at the approach of a supposed enemy. Almost every conspicuous\r\nrock on the acclivity bore evidence of having been used as a lookout by\r\nthe little sentinel.\r\n\r\nThis wren is well named, for his home is among the rocks, in the\r\ncrannies and niches of which his mate hides her nest so effectually that\r\nyou must look long for it, and even after the most painstaking search\r\nyou may not be able to find it. The little husband helps to lead you\r\nastray. He will leap upon a rock and send forth his bell-like peal, as\r\nif he were saying, \"Right here, right here, here is our nest!\" but when\r\nyou go to the spot, he flits off to another rock and sounds the same\r\nchallenge. And so you can form no idea of the nest site. My nearest\r\napproach to finding a nest was among the rocks and cliffs on the summit\r\nof a mountain a few miles from Golden, where an adult bird was seen to\r\nfeed a youngster that had already flown from the nursery. It was\r\ninteresting to know that the rock wrens breed at so high an altitude.\r\nHowever, they are not an alpine species, none having been seen by the\r\nwriter over eight thousand feet above sea-level, although they have been\r\nknown to ascend to an altitude of twelve thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe fourth member of our feathered quartette was the oddest of all. On\r\nthe thirtieth of June my companion and I were riding slowly down the\r\nmountain side a few miles below Gray's Peak, which we had scaled two\r\ndays before. My ear was struck by a flicker's call above us, so I\r\ndismounted from my burro, and began to clamber up the hillside.\r\nPresently I heard a song that seemed one moment to be near at hand, the\r\nnext far away, now to the right, now to the left, and anon directly\r\nabove me. To my ear it was a new kind of bird minstrelsy. I climbed\r\nhigher and higher, and yet the song seemed to be no nearer. It had a\r\ngrosbeak-like quality, I fancied, and I hoped to find either the pine\r\nor the evening grosbeak, for both of which I had been making anxious\r\nsearch. The shifting of the song from point to point struck me as odd,\r\nand it was very mystifying.\r\n\r\nHigher and higher I climbed, the mountain side being so steep that my\r\nbreath came in gasps, and I was often compelled to throw myself on the\r\nground to recover strength. At length a bird darted out from the pines\r\nseveral hundred feet above me, rose high into the air, circled and swung\r\nthis way and that for a long time, breaking at intervals into a song\r\nwhich sifted down to me faintly through the blue distance. How long it\r\nremained on the wing I do not know, but it was too long for my eyes to\r\nendure the strain of watching it. Through my glass a large part of the\r\nwings showed white or yellowish-white, and seemed to be almost\r\ntranslucent in the blaze of the sunlight. What could this wonderful\r\nhaunter of the sky be? It was scarcely possible that so roly-poly a bird\r\nas a grosbeak could perform so marvellous an exploit on the wing.\r\n\r\nI never worked harder to earn my salary than I did to climb that steep\r\nand rugged mountain side; but at last I reached and penetrated the zone\r\nof pines, and finally, in an area covered with dead timber, standing and\r\nfallen, two feathered strangers sprang in sight, now flitting among the\r\nlower branches and now sweeping to the ground. They were not grosbeaks,\r\nthat was sure; their bills were quite slender, their bodies lithe and\r\ngraceful, and their tails of well-proportioned length. Save in color,\r\nthey presented a decidedly thrush-like appearance, and their manners\r\nwere also thrush-like.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the colors and markings puzzled me not a little. The upper parts\r\nwere brownish-gray of various shades, the wings and tail for the most\r\npart dusky, the wing-coverts, tertials, and some of the quills bordered\r\nand tipped with white, also the tail. The white of both wings and tail\r\nbecame quite conspicuous when they were spread. This was the feathered\r\nconundrum that flitted about before me. The birds were about the size of\r\nthe hermit thrushes, but lither and suppler. They ambled about\r\ngracefully, and did not seem to be very shy, and presently one of them\r\nbroke into a song--the song that I had previously heard, only it was\r\nloud and ringing and well articulated, now that I was near the singer.\r\nAgain and again they lifted their rich voices in song. When they\r\nwandered a little distance from each other, they called in affectionate\r\ntones, giving their \"All's well.\"\r\n\r\nThen one of them, no doubt the male, darted from a pine branch obliquely\r\ninto the air, and mounted up and up and up, in a series of graceful\r\nleaps, until he was a mere speck against the blue dome, gyrating to and\r\nfro in zigzag lines, or wheeling in graceful circles, his song dribbling\r\nfaintly down to me at frequent intervals. A thing of buoyancy and grace,\r\nmore angel than bird, that wonderful winged creature floated about in\r\nthe cerulean sky; how long I do not know, whether five minutes, or ten,\r\nor twenty, but so long that at last I flung myself upon my back and\r\nwatched him until my eyes ached. He kept his wings in constant motion,\r\nthe white portions making them appear filmy as the sun shone upon them.\r\nSuddenly he bent his head, partly folded his wings, and swept down\r\nalmost vertically like an arrow, alighting safe somewhere among the\r\npines. I have seen other birds performing aerial evolutions accompanied\r\nwith song, but have never known one to continue so long on the wing.\r\n\r\nWhat was this wonderful bird? It was Townsend's solitaire (_Myadestes\r\ntownsendii_)--a bird which is peculiar to the West, especially to the\r\nRocky Mountains, and which belongs to the same family as the thrushes\r\nand bluebirds. No literature in my possession contains any reference to\r\nthis bird's astonishing aerial flight and song, and I cannot help\r\nwondering whether other bird-students have witnessed the interesting\r\nexploit.\r\n\r\nSubsequently I found a pair of solitaires on the plains near Arvada. The\r\nmale was a powerful singer. Many of his outbursts were worthy of the\r\nmocking-bird, to some of whose runs they bore a close resemblance. He\r\nsang almost incessantly during the half day I spent in the neighborhood,\r\nmy presence seeming to inspire him to the most prodigious lyrical\r\nefforts of which he was master. Sometimes he would sit on the top of a\r\nbush or a fence-post, but his favorite perches were several ridges of\r\nsand and gravel. His flight was the picture of grace, and he had a habit\r\nof lifting his wings, now one, now the other, and often both, after the\r\nmanner of the mocking-bird on a chimney-top. He and his mate did not\r\nutter a chirp, but made a great to-do by singing, and finally I\r\ndiscovered that all the fuss was not about a nest, but about a hulking\r\nyoungster that had outgrown his kilts and looked very like a brown\r\nthrasher. Neither of this second pair of solitaires performed any\r\nevolutions in the upper air; nor did another pair that I found far up a\r\nsnow-clad mountain near Breckenridge, on the other side of the\r\nContinental Divide.\r\n\r\nThe scientific status of this unique bird is interesting. He is a\r\nspecies of the genus _Myadestes_, which belongs to the family _Turdidæ_,\r\nincluding the thrushes, stone-chats, and bluebirds, as well as the\r\nsolitaires. He is therefore not a thrush, but is closely related to the\r\ngenus _Turdus_, occupying the same relative position in the avi-faunal\r\nsystem. According to Doctor Coues the genus includes about twenty\r\nspecies, only one of which--the one just described--is native to the\r\nUnited States, the rest being found in the West Indies and Central and\r\nSouth America. Formerly the solitaires comprised a subfamily among the\r\nchatterers, but a later and more scientific classification places\r\nthem in a genus under the head of _Turdidæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII\r\n\r\nBROWN-CAPPED LEUCOSTICTE--_Leucosticte australis_\r\n(Lower figure, male; upper, female)]\r\n\r\nThe range of Townsend's solitaire is from the plains of Colorado to the\r\nPacific coast and north to British Columbia. According to Robert\r\nRidgway, he has even been met with \"casually\" in Illinois. In Colorado\r\nmany of the solitaires are permanent residents in the mountains,\r\nremaining there throughout the winter. Some of them, however, visit the\r\nplains during the fall, winter, and spring. In the winter they may be\r\nfound from the lower valleys to an elevation of ten thousand feet, while\r\nthey are known to breed as high as twelve thousand feet. The nests are\r\nplaced on the ground among rocks, fallen branches and logs, and are\r\nloosely constructed of sticks and grass. From three to six eggs compose\r\na set, the ground color being white, speckled with reddish brown. Doctor\r\nCoues says the birds feed on insects and berries, and are \"capable of\r\nmusical expression in an exalted degree.\" With this verdict the writer\r\nis in full accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHECK-LIST OF COLORADO BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list includes all the species and varieties, so far as\r\nknown to naturalists, occurring in the State of Colorado. Of course,\r\nthese birds as families are not restricted to that State, and therefore\r\nthe catalogue comprehends many of the species to be found in adjacent\r\nand even more remote parts of the country. Aside from the author's own\r\nobservations, he is indebted for a large part of the matter comprised in\r\nthis list to Professor Wells W. Cooke's pamphlet, entitled, \"The Birds\r\nof Colorado,\" with the several appendixes, and to the invaluable manuals\r\nof Mr. Ridgway and Dr. Coues.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest information accessible to the writer, 389\r\nspecies and varieties occur in Colorado, of which 243 are known to\r\nbreed. This is a superb record, and is excelled by only two other States\r\nin the Union, namely, Texas and California. Colorado's splendid list is\r\nto be explained on the ground of its wonderful variety of climate,\r\naltitude, soil, and topographical features, such as its plains,\r\nfoothills, lower mountains, and towering peaks and ranges, bringing\r\nwithin its boundaries many eastern, boreal, middle western, and far\r\nwestern forms.\r\n\r\nThe author's preference would have been to begin the roll with the most\r\ninteresting birds, those to which he gave the largest share of his\r\nattention, namely, the oscines, but he has decided to follow the order\r\nand nomenclature of the Check-List of North American birds as arranged\r\nby the American Ornithologists' Union. In deference to the general\r\nreader, however, he has placed the English name of each bird first, then\r\nthe scientific designation. The numbers correspond to the American\r\nCheck-List. By noting those omitted, the reader will readily discover\r\nwhat species have not been found in Colorado.\r\n\r\n1. =Western grebe.= ÆCHMOPHORUS OCCIDENTALIS.
