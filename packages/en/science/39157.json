PATHOLOGY AND GENERAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA:\r\n\r\nLEA BROTHERS & CO.\r\n\r\n1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1885, by LEA\r\nBROTHERS & CO., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress. All rights\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTCOTT & THOMSON, _Stereotypers and Electrotypers, Philada._\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. DORNAN, _Printer, Philada._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present work has been undertaken in the belief that by obtaining\r\nthe co-operation of a considerable number of physicians of\r\nacknowledged authority, who should treat subjects selected by\r\nthemselves, there could be secured an amount of practical information\r\nand teaching not otherwise accessible. It was determined to restrict\r\nthe selection of authors to those of this country--including\r\nCanada--not from any want of recognition of the importance of the\r\nstudies of certain special subjects by European investigators, but\r\nbecause it was felt that the proper time had arrived for the\r\npresentation of the whole field of medicine as it is actually taught\r\nand practised by its best representatives in America.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of importance also that a comprehensive study shall be\r\nmade of the various forms of disease as occurring among our highly\r\ncomposite population and under our varied and peculiar climatic\r\ninfluences. Of course, in the present work comparative studies of this\r\nkind must occupy a subordinate position; yet it cannot fail to enhance\r\nboth its interest and its value to have the various forms of disease\r\nas they occur in this country discussed by those among us who are\r\nconfessedly the most competent and experienced.\r\n\r\nThe force of these observations must have been felt by the\r\ndistinguished men to whom I made application, for with scarcely an\r\nexception they joined cordially in the laborious undertaking. I take\r\nthe greatest pleasure in testifying to the courtesy which has marked\r\nall our relations, and which has lessened materially the labor and\r\nstrain inevitable in the production of such a work.\r\n\r\nTo ensure greater accuracy in the revision of the large amount of\r\nproof-sheets, as well as to relieve me of some of the details\r\nconnected with the editorial work, I associated with myself Dr. THOMAS\r\nHOLMES CATHCART, and, after sudden illness had cut short his very\r\npromising career, I was fortunate in securing the assistance of Dr.\r\nLOUIS STARR for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the work as valuable as possible to the general\r\npractitioner, its scope has been made as comprehensive as could be\r\ndone without exceeding the limits prescribed by the nature of the\r\nundertaking. This will be particularly noted in the section on\r\nGynæcology, where is presented a series of articles by eminent\r\nspecialists upon the subjects of chief importance to the general\r\npractitioner, written with special reference to their constitutional\r\nrelations and their bearings on associated morbid conditions, while,\r\namong the general diseases, a full article on puerperal fever has\r\nproperly been included. Important articles will also be found on\r\nTracheotomy, the Diseases of the Rectum and the Anus, and those of the\r\nBladder and the male sexual organs. Comprehensive sections have\r\nfurther been provided, from the pens of distinguished specialists,\r\nupon medical ophthalmology, medical otology, and on skin diseases,\r\npresenting these large and complicated subjects in a clear and\r\npractical light and with special reference to their relations to\r\ngeneral medical practice. In the presentation of such subjects as\r\nhydrophobia, glanders, and anthrax care has been taken to ensure the\r\nfull discussion of these affections, not only as occurring in man, but\r\nalso in the lower animals, since it is highly important to provide the\r\nphysician with authoritative information on at least such points of\r\nVeterinary Science as have a direct practical bearing on morbid\r\nprocesses in man.\r\n\r\nIn view of the intimate relations of all questions of hygiene to the\r\ncausation and prevention of disease, in regard to which medical men\r\nare constantly consulted, and are, indeed, often obliged to assume\r\nweighty responsibilities, interesting articles on Drainage and Hygiene\r\nhave been provided.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid repetition and confusion, and at the same time to\r\nsecure a comprehensive presentation of the subjects of General\r\nPathology and of General Etiology, Symptomatology, and Diagnosis,\r\nconsiderable space has been devoted to their full discussion. The\r\nchapter on General Morbid Processes will be found to convey distinct\r\nand conservative teaching on all points included under that\r\ncomprehensive title, and will thus supply a solid basis for the\r\nsubsequent discussions of special morbid conditions. In any work on\r\nGeneral Medicine at the present day frequent allusion must be made to\r\nthe relations of various low organisms to morbid processes. This\r\nquestion--or rather the series of questions which arise in connection\r\nwith this subject, and which at present form the most fruitful topic\r\nof discussion and of investigation--will be found treated by different\r\nauthors in various places and from various standpoints. No attempt has\r\nbeen made to secure uniformity of views upon a matter which is still\r\n_sub judice_, and which demands much more skilful and critical\r\ninvestigation before its true scientific position has been finally\r\ndetermined. It has even been felt to be desirable to allow a certain\r\namount of repetition, which has naturally resulted from the\r\nintroduction of this discussion, not only in the chapter on General\r\nEtiology, but in connection with the causation of scarlatina,\r\ndiphtheria, hydrophobia, pyæmia, puerperal fever, and phthisis.\r\n\r\nThroughout the work the chief purpose of the editor and of his\r\ncollaborators, to furnish a concise and thoroughly practical system of\r\nmedicine, has compelled the omission of bibliographical lists, of\r\nnumerous references, and of extended discussions of theoretical views\r\nor of controverted questions, in order that more space might be\r\ndevoted to clear descriptions of disease and to a full presentation of\r\nthe subjects of diagnosis and treatment. If it should seem, in\r\nconsequence, that inadequate recognition has been made of the labors\r\nof others, it must be borne in mind that ample quotations and numerous\r\nreferences were inadmissible in such a work as the present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe classification and nomenclature which have been adopted are those\r\nrecommended by the Royal College of Physicians of England and by the\r\nAmerican Medical Association. Charts and tables have been inserted\r\nwherever they were needed to elucidate the text, but after mature\r\nreflection it was felt necessary to omit all illustrations that were\r\nnot imperatively required, although many original drawings and\r\npaintings of high value were offered with the articles.\r\n\r\nTHE EDITOR.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

FITZ, M.D.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the preparation of this subject full and free use has\r\nbeen made of the following works: _Die Cellular Pathologie_, Virchow,\r\n4te Auflage, Berlin, 1871; _Handbuch der Allgemeinen Pathologie_, Uhle\r\nund Wagner, 7te Auflage, Leipzig, 1876; _Handbuch der Allgemeinen\r\nPathologie als Pathologische Physiologie_, Samuel, Stuttgart, 1879;\r\n_Vorlesungen über Allgemeine Pathologie_, Cohnheim, 2te Auflage,\r\nBerlin, 1882; _Lehrbuch der Pathologischen Anatomie_,\r\nBirch-Hirschfeld, 2te Auflage, 1er Band, Leipzig, 1882; _Lehrbuch der\r\nAllgemeinen und Speciellen Pathologischen Anatomie_, Ziegler, 1er und\r\n2er Theil, Jena, 1882 and 1883.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MORBID PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisease is to be regarded as representing the result of a series of\r\nprocesses called morbid or pathological, from the fact that they are\r\nmanifested by disturbances in the organism.\r\n\r\nThe processes concerned are the same in kind as those essential to\r\nhealth, but they are modified in time, place, or quantity.\r\n\r\nMorbid processes, therefore, are to be considered as modified\r\nphysiological processes tending to cause disease.\r\n\r\nAll physiological processes are subject to certain variations which\r\ntend to produce disturbances in the functions of the body. In the\r\nhealthy organism this tendency is checked by the automatic regulators\r\nof the functional activity of the various organs, to the importance of\r\nwhich Virchow[2] long ago called attention. By their action the\r\ninfluence of external agents is controlled within certain limits. The\r\nlids close and prevent injury to the eye. Sneezing, coughing, and\r\nvomiting bring about the expulsion of noxious irritants. Sweating aids\r\nin neutralizing the injurious effects of exposure to high\r\ntemperatures. Rapid respiration permits a sufficient cleansing of the\r\nblood in rarefied atmospheres. When the limits, within which the\r\nregulation of physiological processes is possible, are exceeded, such\r\nprocesses become pathological and disease begins. A morbid process,\r\ntherefore, is usually incapable of recognition till disease is\r\npresent. It may exist and disease be unsuspected and denied. A\r\ndiminished blood-supply may be one link in the process which\r\neventually leads to the production of disturbances. {36} Another link\r\nis to be found in the fatty degeneration resulting from this lack of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Handbuch der Speciellen Pathologie und Therapie_,\r\nVirchow, 1er Band, p. 15, Erlangen, 1854.]\r\n\r\nSuch a degeneration may have long existed in the walls of a\r\nblood-vessel, and yet the individual appear in the best of health. The\r\nsudden rupture of the weakened wall results in death or disease. With\r\nthe manifestation of the disturbances which render the condition of\r\nthe vessel obvious the individual is said to be diseased.\r\n\r\nIn most instances, however, the morbid process makes itself early\r\napparent. Disturbances of nutrition, formation, or function soon\r\nbecome sufficient in quantity to attract attention from the resulting\r\ndiscomfort, and the presence of disease is then recognized. The latter\r\nis thus essentially a conventional term, and begins when the morbid\r\nprocesses occasion a sufficient degree of inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe process is never at a standstill. It either tends toward a return\r\nto the physiological conditions, or its course is in the direction of\r\ntheir destruction. As physiological processes are absolutely dependent\r\nupon the vitality of the elements of the tissues, so those which have\r\nbecome pathological cease to exist with the death of such elements. In\r\nthe dead body there is no disease, although its results remain, and\r\nfurnish the most efficient means of identifying the processes which\r\noccasioned them.\r\n\r\nIn the study of morbid processes, therefore, one must appreciate the\r\nnormal conditions and manifestations of life in the individual.\r\nPhysiological laws govern pathological phenomena, and the latter must\r\nalways be submitted to the tests furnished by the former.\r\n\r\nJust as little, however, as the study of anatomy familiarizes the\r\nstudent with the anatomical changes resulting from diseased processes,\r\ndoes the study of physiology accustom the student to the features of\r\ndisease. Pathological processes must be studied by themselves and for\r\nthemselves, although the means which are employed may be the same as\r\nthose used in physiological research.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the exactness of method which is the demand of the\r\nphysiological investigator cannot be secured by the pathologist. The\r\nmaterial of the latter lies farther, beyond his control. Nevertheless,\r\nmuch of the ground to be gone over is common, and the object sought\r\nfor is essentially the same--the knowledge of the conditions necessary\r\nto maintain life.\r\n\r\nIn an introduction to the study of disease there are certain processes\r\nwhich deserve early recognition. They are both the cause and the\r\nresult of disease, and may occur in various diseases, either limited\r\nto one organ or present in a series of organs. Their treatment at\r\npresent obviates the necessity of repetition, and prepares the reader\r\nfor the special consideration of their occurrence in the various\r\nstructures and systems of the body.\r\n\r\nThese processes are named in virtue of some prominent characteristic,\r\nand each is made up of a complex series of conditions and\r\ndisturbances. In part, they represent modifications in the circulation\r\nof blood and lymph; in part, they consist of nutritive derangements,\r\nwhose consequences appear as the various degenerations, or as the\r\nadditions to the body, the new formations.\r\n\r\nThe processes and groups of processes in question are those included\r\nunder the following heads: inflammation; thrombosis and embolism;\r\neffusions; degenerations; tuberculosis; and morbid growths.\r\n\r\n\r\n{37} Inflammation.\r\n\r\nInflammation is characterized now, as in the time of Galen, by the\r\npresence of redness, heat, swelling, and pain. The disturbance of\r\nfunction, added to modern definitions, is to be regarded either as a\r\nresult or a cause, or both, of the variously modified physiological\r\nprocesses whose sum is the inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe redness of inflammation is obviously dependent upon the presence\r\nof an increased quantity of blood. This is readily apparent in the\r\ndirect observation of the blood-vessels of an inflamed, transparent\r\npart of the body, as the mesentery of the frog or rabbit, or the\r\ntongue and webbed foot of the former animal. The redness of\r\ninflammation consequently demands the presence of blood-vessels in the\r\naffected region, and becomes all the greater the more vascular the\r\npart--_i.e._ the richer it is in such vessels.\r\n\r\nRedness does not suffice for the existence of inflammation, for it may\r\nbe found in the absence of other evidence of the latter. The diffused\r\nredness, often extensive, of birth-marks, that from venous obstruction\r\nor temporary congestions, from vaso-motor disturbances--the section of\r\nthe sympathetic furnishing a well-known instance--are examples of\r\nnon-inflammatory redness. Inflammation may even be present without\r\nredness, as may be constantly observed in the occurrence of\r\nparenchymatous inflammation and of the chronic interstitial varieties.\r\n\r\nThe heat of inflammation is one of the most important clinical\r\nfeatures, yet not indispensable, as appears from its absence in\r\nchronic interstitial forms of inflammation. In the acute varieties of\r\ninflammation an elevated temperature is constant, and its observation\r\nand record furnish a most valuable means of determining the beginning\r\nand progress of an inflammation, which, for a time, may furnish but\r\nlittle additional evidence.\r\n\r\nThe heat of inflammation is the prominent characteristic of\r\ninflammatory fever, and it is the study of this variety of fever of\r\nlate years which has resulted in an intelligible and relatively\r\nsatisfactory theory concerning fevers in general. Information of much\r\nvalue is to be found in the recent work of Wood,[3] which contains\r\nabundant historical information, as well as extensive original\r\nobservations and conclusions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Fever: A Study in Morbid and Normal Physiology_, H. C.\r\nWood, A.M., M.D., Philadelphia, 1880. (Reprint from the _Smithsonian\r\nContributions to Knowledge_, No. 357.)]\r\n\r\nInflammatory fevers are distinguished from idiopathic forms. The\r\nlatter variety includes the occurrence of fever as an attribute of the\r\ndisease concerned, the more characteristic symptoms of which follow\r\nthe febrile outbreak. Local inflammatory processes may take place\r\nduring the progress of the disease with its fever, but such processes\r\nare co-effects of the cause of the latter, rather than its cause. Most\r\nof those diseases in which fever occurs as one of the joint effects of\r\nthe cause of the disease, are included among the infective or zymotic\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe inflammatory fevers are those attending an acute inflammatory\r\nprocess, and are secondary to, and occasioned by, the latter. The type\r\nof this variety is seen in the fever occurring during the progress of\r\na wound, whether its course is toward healing or extension. Such {38}\r\ntraumatic fevers are characterized as septic or aseptic; the former\r\nincluding the conditions of septicæmia and pyæmia. The aseptic\r\ntraumatic fevers, as described by Volkmann,[4] are those which pursue\r\ntheir course with an elevated temperature, but without most of the\r\nother febrile phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Beiträge zur Chirurgie_, Leipzig, 1875, p. 24; _Sammlung\r\nKlinischer Vorträge_, No. 121, Genzmer und Volkmann.]\r\n\r\nFever in general is characterized by a combination of disturbances in\r\nthe physiological processes of the body. Such processes are those\r\nconcerned in the production and dissipation of heat, in respiration\r\nand circulation, digestion and secretion, and in mental, motor, and\r\nother sensorial action. Such disturbances are manifested by a\r\npersistent elevation of temperature, an increased destruction of\r\ntissue, a quickened and modified pulse, accelerated breathing,\r\nincreased thirst, diminished appetite, and diminished quantity and\r\naltered quality of the secretions. The sensorial disturbances include\r\nwakefulness and stupor, headache, delirium, twitchings, cramps, and\r\nother symptoms indicative of functional impairment of the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nOf all these manifold evidences of fever, the elevation of temperature\r\nis the one whose cause, range, and results have been most carefully\r\nand critically investigated. No record of a case in which fever is\r\npresent is regarded as complete without the chart of the daily\r\nvariations in temperature, respiration, and circulation. The practical\r\nvalue of such records is thus admitted, and in the experiments\r\nrelating to the origin of animal heat the observations of temperature\r\nare as essential as the chemical analyses, each of which supplements\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe more accurate determination of the heat produced in the body is\r\nobtained either by the use of the calorimeter (an apparatus for\r\nmeasuring the collected heat liberated from the body) or by estimating\r\nthe quantity of heat produced in the destruction of the constituents\r\nof the body from quantitative analyses of the discharged carbonic acid\r\nand urea. The results of such investigations are regarded by\r\nRosenthal[5] as possessing only a relative value, but justify the\r\nconclusion that most of the heat produced in the organism results from\r\nthe oxidation of its constituents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Hermann's Handbuch der Physiologie_, Leipzig, 1882, iv.\r\n2, 375.]\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of health it is essential that this heat should\r\nbe removed from the body in such quantity that the temperature of the\r\nlatter shall not vary to any considerable extent, for any considerable\r\ntime, from 37.2° C. (98.4° F.). The removal of the heat is mainly\r\naccomplished by its radiation or conduction into a surrounding cooler\r\nmedium, and by the evaporation of moisture from the surface of the\r\nbody. Too great a removal of heat results in death from freezing,\r\nwhile too great an accumulation of heat terminates fatally from the\r\neffects of an unduly elevated temperature. To ensure the normal range\r\nof temperature, constantly changing relations must exist between the\r\nproduction of heat and its dissipation. The cooler the surroundings,\r\nthe more must heat be produced, or the less must heat be evolved from\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nAn increased production of heat is obvious under conditions of climate\r\ndemanding prolonged exposure to low temperature. An abundantly fatty\r\ndiet promotes the formation of heat, while suitable clothing checks\r\nits dissipation. Although it is claimed by Liebermeister that sudden\r\nexposure to cold stimulates heat-production, Rosenthal[6] disputes\r\nthis {39} statement, and maintains that it is still to be regarded as\r\ndoubtful whether the production of heat can be varied to suit the\r\ndemands of sudden and temporary changes of temperature. With the\r\nadmission of this doubt, the regulation of the temperature of the\r\nbody, under the circumstances just referred to, is mainly accomplished\r\nthrough the influence of agencies favoring or checking the loss of\r\nheat. Since heat is largely brought to the surfaces of the body by the\r\ncirculating blood, modifications in the fulness and rapidity of this\r\nsuperficial current produce corresponding differences in the amount of\r\nheat and moisture presented. Such variations are considered to be\r\naccomplished through the action of the vaso-motor nervous system,\r\nwhose differing effects are apparent in the pale, cool skin and the\r\nflushed, warm surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Op. cit._, 413.]\r\n\r\nThe search for the regulation of such vaso-motor action has led to the\r\nview that the production of heat, as well as its dissipation, may be\r\ninfluenced from a nervous centre. Wood[7] claims that the result of\r\nexperiments made by him proves the existence of such a heat-centre in\r\nor above the pons. Although admitting the possibility of its being a\r\nmuscular vaso-motor centre, he regards it rather as an inhibitory\r\nheat-centre, which acts, as suggested by Tscheschichin, by repressing\r\nthe chemical changes in the constituents of the body through which\r\nheat is produced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Op. cit._, 254.]\r\n\r\nThis view is objected to by Rosenthal,[8] on the ground that the facts\r\nare not universally agreed upon, and their interpretation is somewhat\r\nvague. Even the increased production of heat as determined by Wood, if\r\nadmitted, may be regarded as the result of a modified circulation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Op. cit._, 442.]\r\n\r\nThe preservation of a normal range of temperature in general is to be\r\nrecognized as the result of variations in the relation of\r\nheat-production to heat-dissipation. The causes which influence this\r\nrelation may act from without or from within, and are regarded as\r\nproducing their effect by means of the vaso-motor nervous system. The\r\ncauses which act from within are those concerned in the febrile\r\nelevation of temperature. Whether the latter is associated with, or\r\nindependent of, inflammatory processes, the question of first\r\nimportance relates to the modification of physiological conditions.\r\nThe causes of the physiological production of heat and its dissipation\r\nhave already been referred to, and the same elements demand\r\nconsideration in the pathological range of temperature so striking in\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nRelatively accurate inductions with regard to the origin of febrile\r\nheat were first rendered possible by the experiments of Billroth and\r\nWeber. These observers found that the introduction of putrid material\r\ninto the circulation of animals produced fever. It was afterward shown\r\nthat various substances, not necessarily of a putrid character, might\r\nproduce the same result.\r\n\r\nFrom measurements with the calorimeter of the heat produced, it was\r\nconcluded by Wood[9] that in the fever of pyæmic dogs more heat was\r\nproduced than in healthy, fasting dogs, although less than in\r\nhigh-fed, healthy dogs. An increased production of heat in the fevered\r\nanimal is thus obvious, as his capacity to receive and assimilate food\r\nis considerably less than that of a high-fed, healthy dog. The\r\ncalculations of Sanderson, referred to by Wood,[10] based upon the\r\nanalyses of eliminated carbonic {40} acid and urea, show that the\r\nfebrile human subject produces very much more heat than the fasting,\r\nthough less than the fully-fed, healthy, man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Op. cit._, 236.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Op. cit._, 239.]\r\n\r\nAn increased production of heat in fever is generally admitted,\r\nalthough it alone is not to be regarded as the essential feature in\r\nthe elevated range of the temperature. The fasting man or animal under\r\nordinary circumstances is not febrile, and an increased production of\r\nheat from full feeding in health, equal to that observed in fever, not\r\nbeing associated with fever, it is apparent that the retention of the\r\nproduced heat is of importance for the existence of fever. Although it\r\nhas been shown by various observers that more heat is dissipated\r\nduring fever than in health, this increased loss is not in proportion\r\nto the increased production of heat. A persistent elevation of\r\ntemperature is the necessary result. This elevation is subject to\r\ndaily and hourly differences, as is the temperature of the healthy\r\nindividual. These variations in the range of the febrile temperature\r\nare apparently due to an agency like that which dominates the course\r\nof normal temperatures--viz. a varying action of the vaso-motor\r\nnervous apparatus, as well as of that controlling the secretion of\r\nsweat, now permitting, now checking, the dissipation of the produced\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nFor the existence of the elevated temperature of fever, therefore,\r\nthere is demanded the presence of an agent within the body which, as\r\nstated by Wood,[11] shall act \"upon the nervous system which regulates\r\nthe production and dissipation of animal heat--a system composed of\r\ndiverse parts so accustomed to act continually in unison in health\r\nthat they become, as it were, one system and suffer in disease\r\ntogether.\" It may be that there exists, as claimed by Wood and\r\nTscheschichin, a heat-centre independent of the vaso-motor and other\r\ncentres, through which heat is dissipated, or it may be, as maintained\r\nby Rosenthal, that the vaso-motor system alone is concerned in the\r\nregulation of temperature. Such action may be inhibitory or excitant,\r\naccording to the views of the one or the other author, without\r\naffecting the main question as above stated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Op. cit._, 255.]\r\n\r\nThe elevation of temperature suffices to explain for the most part\r\ncertain of the other phenomena of fever, as thirst, digestive\r\ndisturbances, increased respiration, and emaciation. A coincident\r\naffection of various cerebro-spinal centres is demanded to explain the\r\naltered action of the heart and the numerous nervous symptoms which\r\nare to be found in fever. The agent producing such manifold effects is\r\nobviously no unit. It may be introduced from without or it may arise\r\nwithin the body, and its transfer to the nervous centres is\r\nundoubtedly accomplished through the circulation.\r\n\r\nAmong those agents which act from without are to be included the\r\nspecific causes of infective diseases. It is probable that these\r\nproduce the fever, as they occasion other symptoms of the disease, and\r\ntheir action may be regarded as direct, or indirect through the\r\nsecondary products of their own vital changes. In the light of the\r\nexisting facts the products of minute organisms developed outside the\r\nhuman body may give rise to fever when introduced, without the\r\norganism, into the body. The history of septicæmia contains numerous\r\nillustrations of the pyrogenetic properties of material produced in\r\nconnection with wounded surfaces of the body exposed to the action of\r\nminute organisms. The introduction of blood of the same, or of a\r\ndifferent animal, into the {41} circulation of a given animal is\r\nfollowed by fever, as is the injection of considerable quantities of\r\nwater into the blood-vessels. The same is true of various chemical\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nIt is further obvious that the agents producing fever may arise within\r\nthe body. The fever resulting from the deprivation of water, and from\r\nthe destruction of tissues, are instances of the probable origin of\r\npyrogenetic substances from the rapid metamorphosis of tissues.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested by Samuel[12] that under given circumstances the fever\r\nmay be sanatory. This view is based upon the probability that certain\r\nparasitic organisms are destroyed at such temperatures as may be\r\nproduced within the body. The growth of the bacillus of malignant\r\npustule takes place most vigorously at a temperature of 30.5° C. (95°\r\nF.), while its development is feeble at 40° C. (104° F.). The bacillus\r\nof tuberculosis, as shown by Koch, thrives at temperatures between 37°\r\nC. (98.6° F.) and 38° C. (100.4° F.), but its growth ceases at\r\ntemperatures above 41° C. (105.8° F.). The spiral fibre of relapsing\r\nfever, which is present in the blood in great abundance at the\r\nbeginning of the febrile onset, disappears at the close, the\r\ntemperature being 42° C. (107.6° F.). It is not to be found in the\r\nintervals between the febrile paroxysms, but reappears a few hours\r\nbefore the recurrence of the fever. The history of intermittent fever\r\nsuggests a similar relation between its cause and the febrile periods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Op. cit._, 155.]\r\n\r\nThe value of pain as evidence of inflammation is merely relative. Its\r\nexistence depends upon the presence of sensitive nerves, and those\r\ninflammations are the least painful which occur in parts where such\r\nnerves are fewest.\r\n\r\nThe pain of inflammation is attributable to the pressure upon the\r\nnerves of that product of the inflammation known as the exudation.\r\nThis pressure becomes all the greater the more abundant the exudation,\r\nor the greater the obstruction offered to its diffusion throughout the\r\ninflamed part. The intense pain resulting from inflammation of the\r\nfascia or of the periosteum is thus explained, while an inflammation\r\nof the loose connective tissue may be diffused over a wide area with\r\nlittle or no pain. In the chronic varieties of inflammation, where the\r\nexudation is but scanty, and its accumulation extended over a long\r\nperiod of time, there may be no pain during the entire course of the\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nSwelling remains for consideration as the most important of the four\r\ncardinal symptoms. Like the others, its presence is not absolutely\r\nessential. It may exist at one time in the course of the inflammation,\r\nand may be absent at another. Even a diminution in the size of an\r\norgan may suggest the existence of an inflammation, for the yellow and\r\ncirrhotic atrophies of the liver give evidence, respectively, of an\r\nacute and chronic inflammation of this organ.\r\n\r\nThe swelling of an inflamed part is due to the presence of an\r\nincreased quantity of blood, and lymph, and to the exudation. These\r\nconstituents of the swelling are not of equal importance. Although the\r\nquantity of blood in the part is increased, no considerable swelling\r\nis produced, provided the flow of blood and lymph from the part be\r\nunobstructed. The current of lymph through the larger lymphatics may\r\nbe greatly increased, yet a decided swelling be absent, unless there\r\nis an obstruction to the passage of lymph from the inflamed region.\r\n\r\n{42} The exudation is the most essential element of the swelling, and\r\nour knowledge of its origin and fate includes the most important\r\nfeatures of the general pathology of the processes concerned.\r\n\r\nThe inflammatory exudation is represented by the accumulation, outside\r\nthe blood-vessels, of material previously within them. The prevailing\r\nviews concerning the manner of origin of this exudation, and its\r\nrelation to inflammatory processes, are essentially due to the\r\nrediscovery by Cohnheim of the forgotten observation of Addison, that\r\nwhite blood-corpuscles pass through the apparently intact walls of the\r\nblood-vessels.\r\n\r\nIn the observation of the mesentery or other transparent part of a\r\nsuitable animal, the changes taking place in inflammation are, at the\r\noutset, limited to the blood-vessels and their immediate vicinity. The\r\nvessels become dilated and the rapidity of the flow within them is\r\nsoon diminished. In the veins particularly the white blood-corpuscles\r\nseparate in considerable numbers from the general current and line the\r\nwall in constantly-increasing numbers, while the red corpuscles are\r\nborne along the middle of the stream. The white corpuscles stagnate,\r\nstick to the wall for a longer or shorter time, and often change their\r\nplace, while the red corpuscles are in constant and progressive\r\nmotion. In the capillaries a considerable number of white corpuscles\r\nare found in contact with the wall, but numbers of red corpuscles are\r\nassociated with them. The formation of the exudation now begins by the\r\npassage of white corpuscles through the apparently intact wall of the\r\nveins and capillaries, especially of the former. Limited numbers,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, of red corpuscles also make their way\r\nthrough the walls of the capillaries. This is the phenomenon of\r\nemigration, and is associated with the amoeboid movements of the white\r\ncorpuscles.\r\n\r\nWith the passage outward of the white and red corpuscles there is also\r\nthe effusion of liquid material. Both the liquid and solid\r\nconstituents continually escape and spread in all directions beyond\r\nthe wall, following the course of the least resistance. It is probable\r\nthat this course is defined by the pre-existing spaces within the\r\ntissues of the part, the lymph-spaces. The exudation is more abundant\r\nin parts richly provided with blood-vessels and in those containing\r\nthe larger spaces; it is diminished where the vessels are less\r\nnumerous or the surrounding parts more resistant, with smaller and\r\nfewer lymph-spaces. The resulting swelling is the less when ready\r\nopportunities for the diffusion and removal of the exudation by\r\nlymphatics and veins are presented, and when the material appears upon\r\nsurfaces over which it may flow away.\r\n\r\nThe liquid portion of the exudation represents something more than the\r\ntransuded blood-serum, and a certain practical importance results from\r\nthe distinction drawn between an exudation and a transudation. Such a\r\ndistinction is especially called for when the inflammatory or\r\nnon-inflammatory origin of considerable quantities of fluid in the\r\nlarger cavities of the body is concerned. From a recent contribution\r\nto our knowledge of this subject by Reuss[13] the following\r\ninformation is derived: The percentage of albumen is always greater in\r\nexudations than in transudations, and is more constant in the former\r\nthan in the latter. It increases with the severity of the\r\ninflammation, being highest in the ichorous forms, less in the\r\npurulent, and least in the serous exudations. When an {43}\r\ninflammatory exudation is found to contain less albumen than usual,\r\nthe existence of a transudation with secondary inflammation is\r\nsuggested, or the exudation may have taken place in a hydræmic\r\nindividual. A sufficient number of exceptions are met with, however,\r\nto interfere with the absolute nature of this test.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Deutsches Archiv für Klinische Medicin_, 1879, xxiv.\r\n583.]\r\n\r\nThe coagulation of an inflammatory exudation apparently depends upon\r\nthe contained white blood-corpuscles; the more numerous (within\r\ncertain limits) these are in a serous exudation, the more abundant is\r\nthe formation of fibrin. The cellular element likewise is that which\r\nin abundant liquid exudations characterizes them as purulent. Although\r\nit is generally agreed that most of the corpuscles of pus are\r\nemigrated white blood-corpuscles, it is not necessary to admit that\r\nall are of this nature. The cells present in an inflamed part include\r\nthose pre-existing, as well as those which escape from the vessels.\r\nThe former are the wandering cells of the connective tissues, as well\r\nas the fixed variety, the epithelial cells of the surface of a mucous\r\nmembrane in addition to the subjacent connective-tissue cells.\r\nAmoeboid cells outside the blood-vessels have been seen to divide, and\r\nit is possible that such duplication may serve as the method of\r\nformation of a certain number of pus-corpuscles. The statements\r\nconcerning the proliferation of the fixed connective-tissue cells and\r\nof epithelium are derived from appearances, and are interpretations of\r\nthese appearances, not observations of a process.\r\n\r\nThe changes taking place along the walls of the blood-vessels being\r\nthe feature of prime importance in the observation of the progress of\r\nan inflammation, numerous investigators have directed their attention\r\nto the determination of the nature of the changes in the vessel wall\r\nby means of which the escape of the corpuscles is permitted. Arnold\r\nrepresents the most strenuous advocates of the stomata theory,\r\naccording to which the leucocytes pass through canals normally\r\nexisting in the wall. By means of the silver method of staining, and\r\nby injections of various insoluble pigments into the blood-current,\r\ncertain results are met with, which give color to the view that pores\r\nand canals are present upon and in the walls of the vessels, analogous\r\nto those found in the diaphragm. As the latter have been shown to be\r\nin direct communication with the lymphatic system of tubes and spaces,\r\nso the walls of the blood-vessels have been assumed to present similar\r\nchannels of communication.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing views at the present time are in favor of the\r\nartificial nature of the stomata and pores in the walls of the\r\nblood-vessels. An increased porosity of the vascular wall in\r\ninflammation is necessary for the occurrence of the exudation, but\r\nsuch porosity is regarded rather as a physical condition permitting an\r\nobservable filtration, and a filtration of solids as well as liquids.\r\n\r\nIn this connection reference should be made to the observation of\r\nWiniwarter, who has demonstrated that colloid material, a solution of\r\ngelatin, passes through the vascular wall in inflammation more\r\nreadily--_i.e._ under less pressure--than through the normal wall of\r\nthe blood-vessel.\r\n\r\nThe causes of inflammation are to be regarded as those which produce\r\nan increased porosity of the vessel wall without causing its death,\r\nfor no exudation escapes from a dead vessel, its contents becoming\r\nclotted.\r\n\r\nThese causes may act from without or from within, primarily affecting\r\n{44} the tissues outside the vessels, or exerting their action, at the\r\noutset, upon the wall itself. The usual histological relation of\r\nvessels and surrounding tissues is such that both are simultaneously\r\naffected. The occurrence of an inflammation in non-vascular parts,\r\nhowever, as the cornea, from irritation of its centre, the part\r\nfarthest removed from the surrounding blood-vessels, shows that the\r\naffection of the vessels may be indirect as well as direct. This\r\nindirect action is to be regarded as taking place through the agency\r\nof nerves or through that of the nutritive currents. That nervous\r\ninfluence alone does not suffice to transmit the effect of an applied\r\ncause is apparent from the absence of inflammation of the cornea which\r\nhas become anæsthetized by section of the trigeminus nerve. With the\r\nprotection of the cornea from external irritation there is an absence\r\nof inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the final symptom of inflammation, the\r\ndisturbance of function, which has been added in recent times, belongs\r\nto special rather than general pathology. It varies according to the\r\nseat of the inflammation, the disturbed function of the brain or heart\r\ndiffering from that of the liver or kidney. The clinical importance of\r\nthis symptom of inflammation is greater than of all the rest, as it is\r\nthe one whose presence is constant and indispensable.\r\n\r\nAn inflammation may exist, as already stated, without heat, redness,\r\nor pain. The swelling may escape observation from the limited quantity\r\nof the exudation and other causative agents, or from the\r\ninaccessibility of the inflamed part to physical examination. The\r\ndisturbance of function, however, becomes early apparent, and is\r\npresent throughout the course of the inflammation. A knowledge of its\r\nnature enables the seat of the latter to be recognized, and its\r\nvariations furnish a desired test of the efficiency of therapeutic\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe causes of inflammation may be divided into the traumatic, toxic,\r\nparasitic, infectious, dyscrasic or constitutional, and trophic.\r\n\r\nThe traumatic causes are those which act mechanically, producing an\r\ninjury to tissues by pressure, crushing, tearing, stretching, and the\r\nlike. Others represent modifications in temperature, thermic agencies,\r\nand include extremes of cold as well as of heat. The chemicals whose\r\naction is direct, as caustic, include a third variety of the traumatic\r\ncauses. Such chemicals are applied to surfaces, cutaneous or mucous,\r\nand comprise the active element producing the perforating ulcer of the\r\nstomach and duodenum, as well as such substances as potash or\r\nsulphuric acid which may have been swallowed intentionally or\r\naccidentally.\r\n\r\nThe toxic group of causes is closely allied to the chemical variety of\r\nthe traumatic agencies. It includes chemicals whose action is\r\nindirect, through absorption in a diluted form rather than from direct\r\napplication in a concentrated condition. Such chemicals are derived\r\nfrom without, as arsenic, phosphorus, and antimony; or may be formed\r\nwithin the body, and the latter include the chemical products of\r\nputrefactive changes--in the urine, for instance--and, with\r\nconsiderable probability, certain of the active agents of\r\nblood-poisoning in septic diseases. It is not unlikely that some of\r\nthe inflammatory affections met with among the so-called\r\nconstitutional diseases, as rheumatism and gout, may owe their origin\r\nto the production of chemical substances within the body, excessive in\r\nquantity if not changed in quality.\r\n\r\n{45} The parasitic causes of inflammation are both animal and\r\nvegetable, and act upon the surfaces of the body or within its\r\ndeeply-seated parts. Some of the animal parasites act locally at their\r\nplace of entrance, while others produce but slight disturbances in\r\nthis region, their effects usually resulting from the transfer of\r\ntheir offspring to remote parts of the body. The vegetable parasites\r\nare for the most part the various fungi, which act locally upon the\r\nskin or on those transitional surfaces lying between skin and mucous\r\nmembrane. The resulting parasitic inflammations are known as favus,\r\nsycosis, ringworm, thrush, etc. The border-line between such parasitic\r\ndiseases and those included among the infective diseases is somewhat\r\narbitrarily drawn. Parasites in the limited sense act chiefly as\r\nforeign bodies, while the effect of minute vegetable organisms is\r\nrather that of ferments, in virtue of their products. Such a\r\ndistinction is of relative value merely, as the micrococci and\r\nbacteria are capable of acting in other ways than by the production of\r\nseptic material.\r\n\r\nThe infectious causes of inflammation are for the most part parasitic\r\nin their nature, although the discovery and identification of the\r\nparasite are in most of these inflammations assumed rather than\r\ndemonstrated. The relation of the anthrax bacillus to malignant\r\npustule no longer admits of a doubt, mainly in consequence of the\r\nresearches of Koch. This investigator has been enabled to establish a\r\ndefinite etiological relation between the septicæmia of certain\r\nanimals and accompanying minute vegetable organisms. His recent\r\ndiscovery of the bacillus of tuberculosis definitely removes the\r\ntubercular process from the group of dyscrasic or constitutional\r\naffections to that of the infective diseases. The constant presence of\r\nminute organisms in relapsing fever, leprosy, malaria, typhoid fever,\r\ndiphtheria, erysipelas, and numerous other affections associated with,\r\nif not characterized by, inflammatory conditions, renders extremely\r\nprobable the closest pathological relation between such diseases and a\r\nmicroscopic organism. That an inflammatory process may be regarded of\r\ninfectious origin, it is necessary, according to Koch,[14] that a\r\ncharacteristic organism should be found in all cases of the disease,\r\nand in such numbers and distribution as to account for all the\r\nphenomena of the disease in question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Untersuchungen über die Aetiologie der\r\nWundinfectionskrankheiten_, 1878, 27.]\r\n\r\nThese organisms may act in virtue of their growth and the consequent\r\ndemand for oxygen, as seems probable in certain cases of malignant\r\npustule, where the affected individual dies with symptoms of asphyxia.\r\nTheir operation may also be like that of ferments, which produce\r\nchemical material whose effect may be remote from the immediate\r\npresence of the minute organism. They may likewise, in connection with\r\ntheir colonization in various parts of the body, act more immediately\r\nupon the walls of the blood-vessels, and produce that increased\r\nporosity which is so essential a factor in inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the immediate cause of the various infective\r\ndiseases, as measles, scarlatina, variola, cholera, dysentery, mumps,\r\nwhooping cough, cerebro-spinal meningitis, and numerous other epidemic\r\nand endemic affections, still remains a question for the future. The\r\nconstant association of microbia with any or all of such diseases is\r\nbut one fact in connection with them, and such a discovery is to be\r\nregarded merely as a step forward, to be followed by others, each of\r\nwhich represents not only an advance, but confirms the position\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n{46} The dyscrasic or constitutional causes of inflammation are those\r\nwhich, though long established, appear less demanded as our knowledge\r\nadvances. Regarded as the result of an alteration in the composition\r\nof the blood, it is obvious that such changes may arise from the\r\nintroduction, from without, of wholly foreign material. The dyscrasia\r\nmay also represent modifications in the relative proportion of the\r\nnormal constituents of the blood. In the former series are included\r\nwhat, for the most part, have already been referred to under the toxic\r\nand infectious causes of inflammation. The dyscrasiæ from lead,\r\nalcohol, and the like belong to this series. Still more important are\r\nthe poisons, the virus of tuberculosis and scrofula, of leprosy and\r\nsyphilis. The dyscrasiæ known as anæmia, leucæmia, uræmia, icterus,\r\nand diabetes are to be regarded less as inflammatory causes than as\r\npredisposing conditions which favor the action of other groups of\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nThe trophic causes of inflammation are those whose action is supposed\r\nto take place through the influence of nerves. Although, as has\r\nalready been stated, a faulty innervation of tissues is an important\r\nelement in favoring the action of various inflammatory causes, there\r\nremain certain forms of inflammation where the disturbance of nervous\r\naction seems to be the essential feature. The occurrence of an acute\r\nperipheral gangrene soon after certain traumatic or inflammatory\r\nlesions of the brain or spinal cord, of articular inflammation\r\nfollowing chronic affections of the cerebro-spinal axis, are instances\r\nin point. The origin and distribution of herpes zoster, the occurrence\r\nof sympathetic ophthalmia and symmetrical gangrene, suggest a\r\npredominant disturbance of innervation as the exciting cause. At the\r\nsame time, it is desirable to call attention to the recent\r\nobservations of MacGillavray, Leber, and others,[15] which suggest\r\nthat a sympathetic ophthalmia is due to the extension of a septic\r\nchoroiditis along the lymph-spaces of the optic nerve. It is further\r\napparent that in certain so-called trophic inflammations, as the\r\npneumonia after section of the pneumogastric, and the inflammation of\r\nthe eye following paralysis of the trigeminus, the paralysis of the\r\nnerve is a remote, rather than an immediate cause, of the\r\ninflammation. There still remain, however, a number of localized\r\ninflammations whose origin is so intimately connected with nervous\r\ndisturbances as to demand, for the present at least, a corresponding\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Wadsworth's \"Report of Recent Progress in\r\nOphthalmology,\" _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, 1882, cvi.\r\n517.]\r\n\r\nThe course of an inflammation is often indicated by the predominance\r\nof certain symptoms, which, for the most part, indicate a condition of\r\nthe individual acted upon rather than a peculiarity of the cause. The\r\nsthenic inflammations take place in robust individuals with powerful\r\nhearts and an abundant supply of blood. In such persons a strong\r\npulse, high fever, and an injection of the superficial blood-vessels\r\nsuggested, in former times, the necessity of bloodletting as the\r\nessential therapeutic agent. The sthenic form of inflammation was most\r\ncommonly associated with pneumonia, where the obstruction to the\r\npassage of blood through the lungs was an important cause of the\r\nsuperficial injection of the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nThe asthenic inflammations, on the contrary, are those occurring in\r\nfeeble individuals, debilitated in consequence of pre-existing\r\ndisease, exposure, or habits. A weak heart, low febrile temperature,\r\nand {47} superficial pallor, characterize the asthenic inflammations,\r\nwhich show a frequent tendency to become localized in the more\r\ndependent parts of the body, the force of the circulation being too\r\nfeeble to overcome the effect of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIn the typhoidal inflammations are associated those symptoms which are\r\nso prominent in the severe varieties of typhoid fever. These are the\r\npredominant symptoms: hebetude or low, muttering delirium, picking at\r\nthe bed-clothes, involuntary evacuations, stertor, and the like. The\r\nnervous disturbances are associated with a feeble pulse and a dusky\r\nhue of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe constituents of an inflammatory exudation are frequently used as a\r\nbasis of classification, and characterize the inflammation from the\r\nanatomical point of view. As the exudation is complex in its\r\ncomposition, the predominant element is made use of to designate the\r\nvariety, and in doubtful cases a combined adjective indicates the\r\npresence of the two most abundant constituents. As the exudation is\r\ndirectly derived from the blood and contains serum in addition to\r\nwhite and red corpuscles, the serous, purulent, and hemorrhagic\r\nvarieties of exudation naturally arise. The fibrinous and diphtheritic\r\ninflammations relate to the presence of membranes or false membranes.\r\nFinally, there are the productive inflammations, resulting in the new\r\nformation of tissue, and the destructive inflammations, where losses\r\nof substance occur.\r\n\r\nSerous inflammations are most frequent in those parts of the body\r\nwhere the structure contains the largest lymph-spaces. The so-called\r\nserous cavities of the body offer the most favorable opportunities for\r\nthe accumulation, as well as for the exudation, of the inflammatory\r\nproduct; then follow the regions of the larger lymph-spaces, according\r\nto the size and number of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe serous inflammations may also arise from the epithelial coverings\r\nof the body, as the cutaneous, alimentary, and respiratory surfaces.\r\nThe serous exudations of the skin are those present in vesicles,\r\nblisters, or bullæ, which owe their limitation to the resistance\r\noffered to the spreading of the liquid inflammatory product by the\r\ncoherent epidermis. Serous inflammations of the alimentary canal may\r\nassume a vesicular character, although, from the structure of its\r\nmucous membrane and the macerating influence of its contents, the\r\nvesicles are apt to be of an extremely transitory character.\r\n\r\nThe more important serous inflammations of the intestines are those\r\nmanifested by profuse watery evacuations, the extreme form of which is\r\nto be found in cholera.\r\n\r\nSerous inflammation of the lungs accompanies the more severe forms,\r\nand usually represents but a limited and circumscribed affection,\r\nassociated with more abundant cellular and fibrinous products.\r\n\r\nSerous inflammations of the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, tunica\r\nvaginalis, and central ventricles often give rise to the presence of\r\nenormous quantities of fluid, whose partial removal from many of the\r\ncavities concerned by operative measures frequently represents a most\r\nbeneficial result of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe smaller lymph-spaces of the connective tissue in various parts of\r\nthe body are the frequent seat of the inflammatory oedema, so called,\r\nwhose presence is an important indication of the direction assumed by\r\na {48} spreading inflammation, as well as a suggestion of the frequent\r\nvirulence of its cause.\r\n\r\nIn general, the serous inflammations are to be regarded as less severe\r\nthan other varieties, or as representing an early stage of what later\r\nmay be otherwise characterized by a change in the nature of the\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe purulent variety of inflammation is present when the exudation is\r\nabundantly cellular. As has already been stated, such cells are, for\r\nthe most part, white blood-corpuscles. The purulent exudation, like\r\nthe serous variety, may appear either on surfaces, when the term\r\nsecretion is applied, or within the lymph-spaces of the connective\r\ntissue over a considerable space, when the pus is said to be\r\ninfiltrated. When the infiltration is more circumscribed and the walls\r\nof the affected lymph-spaces are destroyed, so that adjoining cavities\r\nare thrown into larger holes, an abscess is present, from whose wall\r\npus is constantly derived, while the inflammation is progressive.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the surgeon, in particular, has been directed to the\r\nisolation of the immediate cause of suppurative inflammation, and the\r\nmodern, antiseptic, treatment of wounds is essentially based upon the\r\nview of the infectious origin of pus. The frequent presence of\r\nmicrobia in purulent exudation where no precautions are taken to\r\nexclude their admission, and their frequent absence or presence in\r\nminute quantities where such precautions are taken, have suggested\r\nthat through their influence an inflammatory exudation is likely, if\r\nnot actually compelled, to become purulent.\r\n\r\nWhether the microbia or their products are the cause of most\r\nsuppurative inflammations may be regarded as an open question. It is\r\ngenerally admitted, however, that, as a rule, an inflammation becomes\r\npurulent in consequence of the presence of an infective agent; in\r\nother words, that most pus is of an infectious origin and possesses\r\ninfectious attributes. The labors of Lister in insisting upon the\r\nexclusion of all possible putrefactive agencies in the treatment of\r\nwounds have met with universal approval, and the basis of his\r\ntreatment remains fixed, although different methods have been devised\r\nfor its enforcement. His researches, and those stimulated by his work,\r\nhave resulted in the establishment of principles which affect the\r\nwhole field of theoretical as well as practical medicine.\r\n\r\nAlthough most pus may be considered as due to the action of a virus\r\nintroduced from without, and capable of indefinite progressive\r\nincrease within the body, all pus is not to be regarded as of\r\ninfectious origin. There are pyrogenetic agencies, like petroleum,\r\nturpentine, and croton oil, which, introduced into the body, produce\r\nsuppurative inflammation without the association of microbia.\r\n\r\nA bland pus is usually in a state of beginning putrescence, so that it\r\nis only relatively bland, and acquires extreme virulence when long\r\nexposed to putrefactive agencies. It is possible that those agencies\r\nproducing an ichorous pus are the same or different from those present\r\nin bland pus. The ichorous exudation contains less corpuscles than\r\nbland pus, is more fluid, less opaque, strongly alkaline, of a\r\ngreenish color, and of offensive odor.\r\n\r\nIn hemorrhagic inflammation the exudation contains large numbers of\r\nred blood-corpuscles. The occurrence of this form is sometimes\r\nassociated {49} with peculiarities of the cause, as is obvious from\r\nthe epidemics of hemorrhagic small-pox, measles, scarlatina, and\r\ncerebro-spinal meningitis. It is also associated with peculiarities of\r\nthe individual, as in such epidemics all cases are not equally\r\nhemorrhagic, and in scurvy the hemorrhages are attributable to the\r\nabnormal conditions to which the sufferers are exposed. Hemorrhagic\r\nexudations are also met with in those inflammations of serous surfaces\r\naccompanying the outcropping of tubercular and cancerous or\r\nsarcomatous growths. In all cases a hemorrhagic exudation represents a\r\ngrave complication, and when found in serous cavities has a certain\r\ndiagnostic, as well as prognostic, importance.\r\n\r\nFibrinous inflammations are characterized by the presence in the\r\nexudation of considerable quantities of fibrin. As the prevailing\r\ntheory of the formation of fibrin demands fibrino-plastic as well as\r\nfibrinogenous material, both are to be sought for in the exudation.\r\nThe latter is present in the liquid portion of the exudation; the\r\nexistence of the former, as well as that of the ferment, is dependent\r\nupon the presence of the white blood-corpuscles. The more numerous\r\nthese, within certain limits, the more abundant the formation of\r\nfibrin. As their death appears essential for the fibrinous\r\ncoagulation, the latter is most constantly met with in those parts of\r\nthe body where the white blood-corpuscles are quickest separated from\r\ninfluences favoring their life. The farther removed they are from the\r\nblood-vessels, the more likely is their early death. Fibrinous\r\nexudations are therefore frequent and abundant in cellular and serous\r\n(sero-cellular) inflammation of the great serous cavities of the body.\r\nThe clotted fibrin appears as false membrane lying upon the serous\r\nsurface, either smooth or rough, tripe-like, or as villosities\r\nprojecting above the surface, and again as bands, fibrinous adhesions,\r\nstretching across the cavity and uniting opposed surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of fibrinous exudations on the mucous\r\nmembranes of the larynx and trachea, accompanied by the suffocative\r\nsymptoms known as croup, has led to the use of the term croupous\r\ninflammation as synonymous with fibrinous inflammation, and its\r\napplication to various parts of the body where croupous--_i.e._\r\nsuffocative--symptoms are not in question. Croupous inflammation, when\r\nused, is to be considered as an anatomical term, indicating merely the\r\nproduction of fibrin, and, for the avoidance of confusion, it is\r\npreferable to substitute fibrinous for croupous when such\r\ninflammations are described.\r\n\r\nThe disease, croup, it is well known, may exist without a\r\ncroupous--that is, fibrinous--inflammation, as is familiarly\r\nrecognized in the constant use of the terms spasmodic, membranous, and\r\ndiphtheritic croup.\r\n\r\nFibrinous inflammation of the mucous membrane of the larger\r\nair-passages is much more frequently met with than that of mucous\r\nmembranes elsewhere, as of the intestines, uterus, and bladder. The\r\npseudo-membranous inflammations of the latter tracts are more commonly\r\nthe result of the catarrhal and diphtheritic varieties than of the\r\nfibrinous form. Fibrinous exudations on mucous surfaces, according to\r\nWeigert, can only take place when the epithelium is destroyed. Hence\r\nthose causes which give rise to the destruction or detachment of the\r\nepithelium are alone capable of producing a fibrinous inflammation of\r\nmucous membranes, and a fibrinous laryngitis, trachitis, and\r\nbronchitis may result from {50} the local application of such\r\nirritants as steam or ammonia, as well as occur in the diseases croup\r\nand diphtheria.\r\n\r\nFibrinous exudations may also be present within tissues, especially in\r\nthose whose meshes are wide, provided the essential elements of\r\ncoagulation are present. The coagulative necrosis of various organs,\r\nto be more fully mentioned hereafter, is closely allied to fibrinous\r\nclotting, the fibrino-plastic element being derived from the death of\r\nthe parenchymatous cells of the part.\r\n\r\nIn the existence of a fibrinous pneumonia the conditions are somewhat\r\nanalogous to those present in the fibrinous inflammation of serous\r\nsurfaces and of the areolar connective tissue. There is present an\r\nabundantly cellular exudation, held in the place of its origin, the\r\ncells undergoing rapid death and surrounded by a wall whose\r\nsuperficial cells resemble in structure, if not in origin, the\r\nendothelial cells lining the smaller lymph-spaces of connective\r\ntissue, as well as the larger cavities within the same, known as\r\nserous cavities.\r\n\r\nThe diphtheritic inflammation is no more to be confounded with the\r\ndisease diphtheria than is the fibrinous inflammation with the disease\r\ncroup. Although diphtheria owes its name to the frequent presence of\r\nan apparent membrane, it may be said that the latter is not essential\r\nto the existence of the former. Diphtheria, like croup, is an\r\naffection in which various exudations may be present, and the\r\nanatomical product alone does not suffice in all instances for the\r\nrecognition of the disease. In croup there may be a swollen mucous\r\nmembrane, with a slight superficial mucous exudation, or a more\r\nabundant exudation of desquamated epithelium and mucus, as well as a\r\nfibrinous false membrane. In diphtheria the same varieties of\r\nexudation may occur, and in addition the diphtheritic exudation may\r\nalso be present. The latter, however, is not limited to the disease\r\ndiphtheria, for its presence is apparent in other mucous membranes\r\nthan that of the air-passages, and in the pharyngeal mucous membrane\r\nin other diseases than diphtheria. A diphtheritic conjunctivitis,\r\nenteritis, cystitis, and endometritis are recognized. The cutaneous\r\nsurfaces of the body may also furnish a diphtheritic exudation. The\r\ndiphtheritic inflammations of wounds and of variolous eruptions are\r\ninstances in point.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a diphtheritic inflammation are the presence\r\nwithin the tissues of a clotted exudation, which is associated with a\r\ndefined swelling and death of the part. The exudation contains not\r\nonly dead leucocytes and interlacing fibres, but is also provided with\r\nabundant granular material, much of which presents the well-known\r\npeculiarities of microscopic organisms. The apparent false membrane is\r\nthus dead, infiltrated tissue, which may be torn away from the\r\ncontinuous unaffected tissue, leaving a raw, rough surface, but not\r\npeeled from a comparatively smooth surface, as in other forms of\r\npseudo-membranous inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe frequent association of a superficial false membrane,\r\ncorresponding in area with that of the deeper-seated changes, in which\r\ncells and fibres may be present, is to be recognized. The diphtheritic\r\nprocess, however, is localized within, and not upon, the tissues\r\naffected. The diphtheritic exudation represents a local death, a\r\nnecrosis, of the part concerned, and the result has frequently been\r\ncompared with the death consequent upon the action of a caustic.\r\n\r\n{51} The immediate cause of a diphtheritic inflammation is now\r\ngenerally attributed to the action of microbia which enter the tissue\r\nfrom without, and in their growth beneath the surface produce not only\r\nthe local, but also the remote, constitutional disturbances which are\r\nassociated with a diphtheritic inflammation. The investigations of\r\nWood and Formad[16] point to ordinary putrefactive organisms as a\r\nsufficient cause for the diphtheritic inflammation of diphtheria,\r\nwhile other observers demand a specific organism as the exciting\r\ncause. The occurrence of diphtheritic inflammations in various parts\r\nof the body, in regions, as the intestine, where putrefactive\r\nprocesses are constantly present, and in the bladder and uterus, where\r\nthe phenomena of putrefaction are often associated with diphtheritic\r\ninflammation, suggest the efficacy of ordinary putrefactive agencies\r\nin producing the latter. As all microbia found in putrefaction are not\r\nalike, and as the properties of certain, differ from those of others,\r\nand as our knowledge of the effects of all is but fragmentary, the\r\ncharacteristics of specific germs for a diphtheritic inflammation of\r\none part of the body, or of all parts of the same, must still be\r\nregarded as not proven.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Research on Diphtheria for the National Board of\r\nHealth_, 1880, Supplement No. 7.]\r\n\r\nProductive inflammations are those which result in the new formation\r\nof tissues. One of the frequent products of inflammation is fibrous\r\ntissue, which, at first abundantly cellular, later becomes more\r\nvascular, and is finally transformed into a tissue whose fibres\r\npredominate over its cells. This formation of a cicatricial tissue\r\ndemands further recognition when the termination of inflammation is\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nIn a more limited sense certain inflammations are called productive\r\nwhen multiple circumscribed new formations, as cancer, sarcoma,\r\ntubercle, and the like, arise in connection with the ordinary products\r\nof inflammation. Such new formations are of frequent occurrence in\r\nserous membranes, and a tuberculous pericarditis or a cancerous\r\nperitonitis, indicates that a growth of tubercles or cancerous nodules\r\nhas taken place, in addition to a more or less abundant exudation with\r\nvarious proportions of serum fibrin and cells. This association of\r\nordinary and transitory inflammatory products with the formation of\r\nmore permanent tissues may be found within organs as well as upon\r\nsurfaces. A tubercular arachnitis or lepto-meningitis presents the\r\nvarious products of an inflammation of the pia mater with an abundant\r\nformation of tubercles. In like manner, a tubercular pneumonia, or a\r\ntubercular nephritis suggests an association of neoplastic growth and\r\ninflammation, in the lung and kidney. Such a relation offers a basis\r\nfor the theory in favor of the inflammatory origin of tumors, and is,\r\nin part at least, a cause for the frequent consideration of tubercles\r\nas mere inflammatory products, wholly cellular or cellular and\r\nfibrous, subject to the same modifications as take place during the\r\ncourse of ordinary inflammations.\r\n\r\nEven if tuberculous and scrofulous inflammations are regarded as\r\ninflammatory processes, modified by a specific cause and by\r\npeculiarities of the individual, the cancerous and sarcomatous\r\ninflammations are still to be considered as representing an\r\nassociation of inflammatory disturbances and specific new formations,\r\nthe cause of the latter not being the cause of the former. As ordinary\r\ninflammations of the regions concerned may take place in the absence\r\nof the neoplasms, so may the {52} specific growth appear in the same\r\nregions without anatomical or clinical evidence of inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe classification of inflammation as to its products is supplemented\r\nby distinctions drawn with reference to the seat. The exudations may\r\nbe superficial or deep-seated; they may lie within the cells,\r\nparenchyma, of an organ, or within the interstitial tissue of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe product of superficial inflammations may lie on the surface, as in\r\nthe case of inflamed mucous membranes, or immediately below the\r\nsurface, as in numerous cutaneous inflammations, of which erysipelas\r\nmay serve as the type. The term catarrhal, applied to superficial\r\ninflammations, carries with it the idea of displacement, flowing, of\r\nthe exudation. The product of a catarrhal inflammation must be largely\r\nliquid, that such a displacement may readily take place, and the\r\ncatarrhal exudation is chiefly composed of an excess of those elements\r\nwhich are present in the normal, physiological secretion from the\r\nmembrane concerned. Mucus therefore represents a frequent constituent\r\nof the catarrhal exudation, and mucous as well as muco-purulent\r\ncatarrhs of the gastro-intestinal, bronchial, genito-urinary, and\r\nother mucous membranes are recognized. The catarrhal inflammation of\r\nthe respective membranes usually represents the mildest form, as it\r\ndemands an intact epithelium, and a ready removal of the inflammatory\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nAs the cause of a catarrhal inflammation may occasion a destruction of\r\nthe epithelium or a necrosis of the mucous membrane, the frequent\r\nassociation of catarrhal with fibrinous or diphtheritic inflammations\r\nis obvious. In such cases the clinical importance of the latter\r\nvarieties gives them the precedence in the designation of the\r\ninflammation. The retention of the catarrhal products is the frequent\r\ncause of permanent disturbances of a more or less serious nature.\r\nThese result in part from the mechanical obstruction offered to the\r\nfunction of parts beyond the seat of obstruction, as pulmonary\r\natelectasis; and in part from the changes taking place in the retained\r\nproduct. Purulent otitis media with its dangerous or fatal results,\r\nand gangrene of the lung terminating in septic pleurisy, are not\r\ninfrequent instances of severe disturbances from putrefaction of the\r\nretained products of a primarily catarrhal inflammation. A cheesy\r\ndegeneration of the catarrhal cells leads to a surrounding fibrous, or\r\ndestructive, inflammation, with a corresponding diminution in the\r\nfunction of the organ affected.\r\n\r\nOf the deep-seated varieties of inflammation, that requiring special\r\nmention is the phlegmonous form. This runs its course within the less\r\ndense fibrous tissue known as the areolar or cellular tissue. The term\r\ncellulitis is usually employed by English writers to indicate the seat\r\nand nature of the process, and although the use of the term cellular\r\ntissue is rapidly becoming obsolete, the convenience of cellulitis\r\nfavors the retention of the latter name.\r\n\r\nThe exudation lies within the larger lymph-spaces, and is therefore\r\nsometimes designated as the result of a lymphangitis, the deep-seated,\r\nwider lymph-spaces being concerned rather than those more superficial.\r\nCertain forms of phlegmonous inflammation are of decidedly infectious\r\norigin, and, when seated subcutaneously, are known as phlegmonous\r\nerysipelas, being thus distinguished from the simple erysipelas, whose\r\nseat is defined by the small superficial lymph-spaces of the skin.\r\n\r\n{53} Infective forms of cellulitis are also frequently met with in the\r\nloose, sub-peritoneal tissue of the pelvis. The infectious element\r\nusually proceeds from the uterus, and excites the malignant oedema of\r\nthe broad ligament, the septic parametritis, or the pelvic cellulitis,\r\naccording as the lymph-spaces inflamed lie nearer the fundus or\r\ncervix, and as the direction of the current is upward toward the\r\nspine, or outward toward the sub-peritoneal lymphatics of the pelvic\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nParenchymatous inflammation is present when the exudation is taken\r\ninto the cells of an organ, or when the changes dependent upon\r\ninflammation of an organ take place within its functionally important\r\ncells. Virchow originally used the term parenchymatous inflammation in\r\ncontradistinction to secretory inflammation, the changes in the former\r\noccurring within the elements of the tissues, while in the latter the\r\nexudation made its appearance on the surface of the organ.\r\n\r\nParenchymatous inflammation is manifested by a degeneration of the\r\ncells affected. This may terminate in their destruction through the\r\nconversion of their protoplasm into fat-drops, fatty degeneration;\r\nalthough more frequently a simple accumulation of albuminoid granules\r\n(granular degeneration) occurs. The latter represents a transitory\r\ncondition, from which a return to the normal state readily takes\r\nplace. This form of inflammation is met with in those organs which\r\npresent a sharply-defined contrast between the functionally important\r\ncells and the connective tissue which surrounds them. The liver,\r\nkidneys, heart, spleen, pancreas, and glands in general, are\r\nconsequently the most frequent seat of parenchymatous inflammation.\r\n\r\nOpposed to this variety is the interstitial inflammation. The\r\nexudation of the latter remains within the connective-tissue framework\r\nof the organ. It is essentially cellular in character, and the number\r\nof cells is comparatively small. With their presence and the\r\npossibility of their nutrition a permanent increase in the quantity of\r\nthe fibrous tissue of the organ is permitted. This becomes relatively\r\ngreater in the course of time, and the parenchymatous cells become\r\ndegenerated and absorbed. Interstitial inflammations are likely to\r\nbecome chronic in character, and, from the outset, are usually\r\nassociated with parenchymatous changes.\r\n\r\nAn important clinical distinction is drawn with reference to the\r\nduration of an inflammation. Acute inflammations are those whose\r\ncourse is rapid, whose progress is associated with graver disturbances\r\nof function, and with a greater prominence of the cardinal symptoms.\r\nThe chronic forms occupy more time in their progress, the functional\r\ndisturbances, though severe, are injurious more from their protracted\r\npersistence, than their temporary violence, while redness, swelling,\r\nheat, and pain are symptoms of trifling prominence.\r\n\r\nThe exudation in acute inflammation, if recovery takes place, is\r\nrapidly removed from the place of its origin, while in the chronic\r\nvariety it tends to become a part of the region in which it lies, or,\r\nif removed, slowly disappears, and may be constantly replaced. Acute\r\ninflammations may become chronic, and the chronic variety is liable to\r\nacute exacerbations.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between acute and chronic inflammations is essentially\r\none of convenience, and, when considered from the anatomical point of\r\nview, relates rather to the persistence of the results. These may be\r\n{54} present as a variously modified exudation or as a degenerated\r\ncondition of the parenchyma of the organ or tissue affected.\r\n\r\nInflammation terminates in resolution, production, or destruction.\r\n\r\nFor resolution to occur it is necessary that the causes of\r\ninflammation cease to act, either by their removal or their isolation,\r\nand that their results be removed. With the removal of the results\r\nthere is often associated the removal of the cause. That such may take\r\nplace it is necessary that the function of the vessel walls be so\r\nrestored that the exudation ceases to escape. Inflammatory products\r\nalready outside the vessels, if present on surfaces with external\r\noutlets, are carried along in the course of the excretions. If they\r\nlie within the cavities of the body not opening externally, their\r\nremoval is accomplished through the medium of the circulating lymph\r\nand blood, by absorption. The liquid portion of the exudation becomes\r\na part of the circulating fluids of the body. The fibrin is converted\r\ninto a granular detritus, which eventually disappears from the place\r\nof its formation. The leucocytes may return to the blood-vessels or\r\nenter the lymphatics; the latter course probably being the one taken\r\nby the larger number of the corpuscles. Many undergo a fatty\r\ndegeneration, and as they lie in lymph-spaces their conversion into an\r\nemulsion permits a removal of the mechanical obstruction to the flow\r\nof lymph through the spaces in which they were accumulated. The red\r\nblood-corpuscles are destroyed, their pigment being dissolved by the\r\nsurrounding fluid and removed in the course of the circulation and\r\nexcretions, or it becomes transformed into granules or crystals, which\r\nmay remain in the place of their formation, or be transferred, within\r\namoeboid cells, to remote parts of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen the exudation is abundant, as in the great lymph-sacs of the\r\nbody--the several serous cavities--and especially when the openings in\r\nthe walls of these sacs are obstructed or the currents within them are\r\nfeeble, absorption takes place with great difficulty, and demands a\r\nlong interval of time. The fibrinous and cellular portion of such an\r\nexudation frequently becomes converted into a caseous mass, from a\r\npartial fatty degeneration and inspissation. This mass becomes\r\nisolated from the cavity in which it lies, usually at the most\r\ndependent portion, by the formation of a capsule of connective tissue.\r\nIt may subsequently become infiltrated with lime salts, calcified, and\r\nthus remain comparatively inert throughout the life of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe productive termination of inflammation is manifested by the new\r\nformation of connective tissue. This tissue is variously designated,\r\nas the inflammatory process is limited to the surfaces of the body\r\nexposed to the air, or the surfaces of cavities and organs, or as it\r\nlies within organs or the deep-seated parts of the body. In numerous\r\ninstances it becomes a permanent constituent of the body, and, as time\r\nis usually essential for its formation, its occurrence is indicative\r\nof a chronic, rather than an acute inflammation. Certain chronic\r\ninflammations are progressive in character, the production of\r\nconnective tissue being continuous, with perhaps occasional\r\nintermissions, as in the chronic interstitial inflammations of organs\r\nand tissues. The new-formed tissue, which at the outset is rich in\r\ncells, becomes in time more fibrous, and associated with this change\r\nin structure is a physical modification, manifested by its shrinkage.\r\nThis new formation may fill a gap resulting from the destruction of\r\ntissue in {55} the progress of an inflammation, when it is present as\r\ncicatricial tissue--the scar which is usually met with upon the\r\nsurfaces of the body or of certain of its organs. When opposed\r\nsurfaces are united by the new-formed tissue, the term adhesion is\r\napplied; the adhesions being present as fibrous bands, cords, or\r\nmembranes. The pericardial milk-spots and thickenings, the tendinous\r\nor semi-cartilaginous, indurated patches of serous membranes and of\r\nthe intima of arteries, are all regarded as manifestations of a\r\nchronic inflammation of these tissues. With the localization of the\r\ninflammation in the outer walls of the bronchi and blood-vessels a\r\nthickening of the external sheath results, called a peri-bronchitis,\r\narteritis, or phlebitis, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe new formation of blood-vessels is essential for the production and\r\npreservation of this connective tissue, and both arise from\r\npre-existing tissues. Pus-corpuscles represent the simple cellular\r\nproduct of an inflammation, and their existence is but transitory.\r\nWith the new formation of blood-vessels imbedded in abundant cells\r\nthere exists a granulation-tissue, likewise transitory, but out of\r\nwhich arises the permanent fibrous tissue. The question is still\r\nmooted as to the part played by exuded white blood-corpuscles in the\r\nproduction of the permanent results of inflammation. It is generally\r\nconceded, especially since the observations of Ziegler, that they are\r\ncapable of transformation into lasting constituents of tissue, into\r\nblood-vessels as well as into cells and fibres. Whether all the\r\nresulting permanent products of inflammation are dependent upon their\r\nactivity, or whether the pre-existing fixed elements participate, is\r\nstill to be considered undecided.\r\n\r\nWhat, at present, appears most probable is, that from exuded\r\nleucocytes there arise, in the course of several days, larger\r\ncells--epithelioid or endothelioid--which are eventually associated\r\nwith still larger cells, more irregular in shape, and provided with\r\nprojecting filaments, giant-cells. Both varieties may result from the\r\nenlargement of leucocytes by fusion or by the assimilation of\r\nnutriment. The epithelioid cells eventually become fusiform or\r\nstellate, and their projections, as well as those of many of the\r\ngiant-cells, become fibrillated. The fibrils of adjoining cells,\r\nbecoming united, are thus transformed into a meshwork of fibrous\r\nbundles enclosing irregular spaces, while the nuclei of the cells,\r\nwith the immediately surrounding protoplasm, remain upon these bundles\r\nas the permanent cells of the new-formed tissue. The blood-vessels\r\narise from pre-existing vessels, chiefly capillaries, and probably are\r\nalso formed from the cells present in the exudation. The former method\r\nis indicated by the projection of solid sprouts from the wall of a\r\ncapillary, which may unite, forming arches, and communicate with\r\nsprouts from neighboring capillaries, thus forming bridges. Both\r\narches and bridges then become hollowed and admit the circulating\r\nblood. Ziegler maintains that the projections of the larger\r\nepithelioid cells and giant-cells become elongated, and eventually\r\nfused with capillaries, or the projections from capillaries. When this\r\nfusion is accomplished the cells become hollowed, their cavities\r\ncommunicating with those of the blood-vessels. These epithelioid\r\ncells, whose formation and transformation are of such importance in\r\nthe history of productive inflammation, are designated by Ziegler as\r\nformative cells, and are frequently derived from the exuded white\r\nblood-corpuscles, though not identical with them.\r\n\r\n{56} The inflammations not terminating in resolution or production,\r\nend in the destruction of the part. This result occurs when the\r\nnutrition of the inflamed territory is so diminished, by the changes\r\nin and around the vessels, as to become insufficient for its\r\npreservation. As the nutriment is derived through the blood-vessels,\r\nthe more complete and the more permanent the stagnation in them the\r\nmore likely is death to result. This event also depends upon the\r\nquantity and quality of the exudation. The more abundantly cellular\r\nthe latter, the more likely is an abscess or ulcer to result.\r\n\r\nAs most abundantly cellular exudations are considered to be dependent\r\nupon the presence of putrefactive agencies, those inflammations of a\r\npredominant putrid character (gangrenous inflammations) are those\r\nterminating in destruction. The dead product is present as a slough or\r\nsequestrum, when dead soft or hard tissues are detached, entire or in\r\npart, from the living; or as a granular detritus contained in a more\r\nor less abundant liquid. The inflammatory process producing the slough\r\nand sequestrum is characterized as a gangrenous inflammation of soft\r\nparts or a caries of bone, while the process resulting in the\r\nformation of the granular detritus, and which has no necessary\r\nconnection with putrefactive agencies, is called a softening, from the\r\nphysical condition of its result.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrombosis and Embolism.\r\n\r\nA blood-clot formed within a blood-vessel during life is called a\r\nthrombus. The entire process of which the thrombus is the essential\r\nelement is designated thrombosis.\r\n\r\nThese terms were introduced by Virchow[17] to avoid the confusion\r\nwhich resulted from regarding the process and result as synonymous\r\nwith inflammation of the vessel. All writers, even at present, do not\r\nadhere to this strictness of meaning. For a thrombus of the vulva\r\nindicates a clot of extravasated blood within the connective tissue of\r\nthe labium; in like manner, a vaginal thrombus is the effused and\r\nclotted blood in the loose connective tissue surrounding the vagina.\r\nThese exceptions are gradually disappearing, and the word hæmatoma,\r\ntumor composed of clotted blood, is being substituted in both\r\ninstances. A cancerous thrombus represents a mass of cancerous tissue\r\nwhose growth is extended along the course of a vessel, its wall having\r\nbeen penetrated. In general, however, the term thrombus, unless\r\notherwise qualified, is used as first stated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Handbuch der Speciellen Pathologie und Therapie_,\r\nErlangen, 1854, i. 159.]\r\n\r\nAlthough thrombosis is commonly a morbid process, it is not uniformly\r\nso. Its physiological significance is illustrated by the part it takes\r\nin the closure of the umbilical and uterine vessels, after childbirth.\r\nThe surgeon makes use of it in his efforts to overcome certain of the\r\nill effects of amputation, and to accomplish a cure of such local\r\ndiseases as aneurism, where it is deemed important to diminish the\r\nsupply of blood.\r\n\r\nThe thrombus being a blood-clot, it is composed, like the latter, of\r\nfibrin and blood-corpuscles. It is presumable that the fibrinous part\r\nof a thrombus owes its origin to the same conditions which determine\r\nthe presence of fibrin in blood removed from the vessels during life\r\nor in that within the vessels after death.\r\n\r\n{57} According to A. Schmidt,[18] the blood and other fluids, in which\r\nclotted fibrin makes its appearance, contain two generators, called\r\nfibrino-plastic and fibrinogenous. The former is considered to be\r\nparaglobulin, a substance contained mainly in the white\r\nblood-corpuscles, while the fibrinogenous generator is held in\r\nsolution in the plasma of the blood. When these materials are acted\r\nupon by a third, the fibrin ferment, clotting takes place and fibrin\r\nis formed. It is thought that the ferment is intimately connected with\r\nthe white blood-corpuscles, for with the microscope coagulation is\r\nseen to advance as these become destroyed, and where the leucocytes\r\nare most abundant, there coagulation advances most rapidly. The\r\nelements of clotted fibrin are always present in circulating blood,\r\nbut Brücke has shown that blood remains fluid, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, because of its constant contact with the normal\r\nvascular wall.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Rollett, _Hermann's Handbuch der Physiologie_, Leipzig,\r\n1880, iv. 1, 114.]\r\n\r\nThe general causes of thrombosis are those which produce an abnormal\r\ncondition of the endothelium, a rapid destruction of the white\r\nblood-corpuscles, or a stagnation of the blood. With the presence of\r\none of these causes there is often conjoined another, and the\r\nconditions under which they are present are conveniently used in the\r\nclassification of thrombi.\r\n\r\nAlthough stagnation of the blood is often an important immediate cause\r\nof its coagulation, it is apparent, from the investigations of\r\nDurante[19] and others, that stagnant blood clots in the living\r\nvessels only when their endothelium is in an abnormal condition. With\r\nthe co-existence of abnormal endothelium and stagnant blood, thrombi\r\nform with greater frequency and become more voluminous in a given\r\ninterval of time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Wiener Medizinische Jahrbucher_, 1871, 321.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the death of white blood-corpuscles in the formation\r\nof thrombi is generally admitted, and is especially insisted upon by\r\nWeigert. According to the observations of Zahn, the nucleus of certain\r\nthrombi is the result of the death of these leucocytes and their\r\naccumulation upon an altered intima. The experiments of Naunyn,\r\nKöhler, and others show that a thrombus may be rapidly produced by the\r\ninjection into the blood of fibrino-plastic substances, and of those\r\nthrough which free hæmoglobin is admitted into the circulation. The\r\nformer may be expressed from a fresh blood-clot; the latter may be\r\nobtained by thawing frozen blood, or by injecting such material\r\n(bile-acids, for instance) into the circulating blood as rapidly\r\ndestroys the red blood-corpuscles. Although Weigert lays special\r\nstress upon the destruction of white blood-corpuscles in the formation\r\nof the thrombus, it appears, from the experiments above referred to,\r\nthat indirectly the destruction of the red corpuscles is also of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAlthough largely made up of fibrin, a thrombus also contains\r\nblood-corpuscles, both red and white, and the appearance of the mass\r\nis modified according to the variations in the relative proportions of\r\nthese constituents.\r\n\r\nZahn[20] divides thrombi, according to their color, into red, white or\r\ncolorless, and mixed varieties. The red owes its color to a large\r\nnumber of red blood-corpuscles, while the white and mixed forms\r\ncontain various proportions of white blood-corpuscles and fibrin and a\r\ndiminished number {58} of red corpuscles. The cause of this difference\r\nin the color of thrombi is to be sought for in their method of origin.\r\nWhen blood clots slowly in a dish, the heavier red corpuscles settle\r\nto the bottom, and the lighter white corpuscles form a superficial\r\nlayer. Stagnant blood clotting rapidly furnishes a uniformly red mass.\r\nThe red thrombus, like the red clot, is the result of the rapid\r\ncoagulation of stagnant blood. The white thrombus, on the contrary,\r\nlargely composed of white blood-corpuscles, represents a constantly\r\nincreasing deposition of these from flowing blood. The mixed thrombi\r\narise from a combination of both conditions, and are usually white at\r\nthe outset. Thrombi formed in the heart and larger arteries are\r\nusually white, those in the auricular appendages and on venous valves\r\nare mixed, while red thrombi are more common in arteries and veins,\r\nsince the conditions favoring their origin are more frequently met in\r\nsuch vessels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1875, lxxii. 85.]\r\n\r\nThrombi are frequently stratified, in consequence of the successive\r\ndeposition of new layers of blood-corpuscles and fibrin upon a\r\npre-existing thrombus. Circulating blood is therefore necessary for\r\nthe stratification, and such thrombi are likely to be mixed in color.\r\nUnstratified thrombi are usually white or red, the former largely\r\ncomposed of agglomerated white blood-corpuscles so moulded and\r\nsituated as to prevent a stagnation of blood in their vicinity, while\r\nthe red thrombus is rarely stratified, since its formation demands a\r\nstoppage of the blood-current. Stratification is intimately connected\r\nwith the enlargement or growth of the thrombus, which takes place from\r\nthe surface exposed to the flowing blood, and which is greater or less\r\naccording to the seat of the thrombus.\r\n\r\nThrombi are usually divided into those from compression, dilatation,\r\ntraumatism, and marasmus; in all of which groups an abnormal condition\r\nof the endothelium is to be met with.\r\n\r\nThrombi from compression are frequently formed in veins, in the\r\nvicinity of growing tumors. Their presence is most constant when the\r\nvein is compressed between a resistant surface, especially bone, and\r\nthe tumor. A compression of the smaller blood-vessels within an organ,\r\nas the liver or kidney, may take place in consequence of chronic\r\ninterstitial inflammation, or the growth of cancerous or other\r\nmalignant tumors in such organs. The production of this form of\r\nthrombus is sought for in the treatment of certain aneurisms by direct\r\npressure, the resulting stagnation of blood being followed by a\r\ncoagulation within the aneurismal sac.\r\n\r\nThrombi from dilatation are met with both in dilated arteries and\r\nveins. In aneurism and varix a slowing of the blood-current is\r\npresent, and the intima of the diseased region is frequently in such\r\nan abnormal condition that a clotting of the blood readily takes\r\nplace. The shape and situation of the dilatation are of importance in\r\npromoting the formation of the thrombus; the more pedunculate and the\r\nmore voluminous the sac the more certain is the thrombosis.\r\n\r\nTraumatic thrombi result from a direct injury to the vessel. This may\r\nbe mechanical, as in the application of ligatures for the obliteration\r\nof vessels, the tearing of the veins during childbirth, and the\r\ninfliction of wounds of every variety. The injury may likewise be\r\nchemical, from the action of caustics; somewhat analogous to which,\r\nare the effects of heat and cold. Allied to the traumatic thrombi are\r\nthose which arise {59} from acute inflammation of the intima extending\r\nfrom wounds or inflammatory processes in the vicinity of\r\nblood-vessels.\r\n\r\nMarantic thrombi are those whose origin is attributable to that\r\nenfeebled condition of the body known as marasmus. This represents a\r\nweakening of the several functions, especially the circulation,\r\nrespiration, and locomotion. Such may take place in disease or old\r\nage; and it is important to bear in mind those diseases in which\r\nmarasmus is likely to arise, as thrombosis often proves a complication\r\nof such affections. Protracted fevers, as typhus and typhoid,\r\npuerperal diseases, the disturbances following surgical operations,\r\nchronic wasting diseases, as the tuberculous and scrofulous\r\naffections, are all likely to be accompanied by thrombosis. Stagnation\r\nof the blood, as well as alterations of the intima, is an important\r\nlocal condition in this variety of thrombosis, which is usually\r\nvalvular or parietal at the outset, and may be both arterial and\r\nvenous. Such thrombi are likely to become continued and to serve as a\r\nfrequent source of embolism.\r\n\r\nThrombi are also divided into primitive, or autochthonous, and\r\nsecondary varieties. The primitive thrombus is one which owes its\r\nlocal origin to conditions existing at the place of its formation and\r\nattachment. The secondary variety demands for its existence a\r\nprimitive thrombus, whose place of development is remote in time and\r\nseat, and from which a part has been transferred to serve as the\r\nnucleus for the secondary formation.\r\n\r\nThe continued thrombus is often confounded with the secondary variety.\r\nContinuance is rather a quality of all thrombi, and is essentially\r\ngrowth, whether by lamellation or agglomeration. Such continued\r\nthrombi are extended in the course of the circulation, usually by a\r\nconical end, which is pointed toward the heart in the case of venous\r\nthrombi, but away from this organ when the thrombi are arterial.\r\n\r\nParietal and obstructing thrombi form another subdivision. The former\r\narise from a limited part of the wall of the heart or blood-vessel,\r\nand project into its cavity. They are always in contact with flowing\r\nblood, and are white or mixed in color and primitive. They may attain\r\na considerable size, and may eventually become obstructing thrombi.\r\nThe latter are so called when they are of sufficient size to cause a\r\nconsiderable or total obstruction to the current of blood. In the last\r\ncase the vascular canal is wholly filled by the thrombus. The shape of\r\nthe older parietal forms is usually globular or pedunculate, owing to\r\nthe growth in all directions except at the place of attachment; the\r\nobstructing thrombi are elongated.\r\n\r\nThrombi are also characterized by consistency and relative absence of\r\nmoisture. A thrombus is brittle and dry as compared with a clot. In\r\ndistinguishing between the two, difficulty arises only in the case of\r\na thrombus which may have formed within a few hours before death.\r\nPost-mortem clots are moist, elastic, readily withdrawn from\r\nblood-vessels, and have a smooth and lustrous surface. Their color is\r\neither red, gray, grayish-yellow, or yellow, and is very often mixed.\r\nThe lighter colors are due to causes which favor the precipitation of\r\nred blood-corpuscles before actual clotting takes place, or which\r\noccasion an increase of the white blood-corpuscles in fibrin. The\r\nthrombus becomes adherent to the vessel wall within a few hours, after\r\nits formation, in the case of the red thrombus, and at once, in the\r\ncase of the white variety. A clot is never adherent, although it may\r\nseem so from its entanglement between the trabeculæ and {60} tendons\r\nof the heart and the cavernous framework of venous sinuses. Such\r\napparent adhesions are easily recognized by the smooth, shining,\r\nintact intima which is disclosed after the removal of a clot.\r\n\r\nThe thrombus not only tends to become enlarged by further depositions\r\nof material from the blood, but it also tends to become diminished in\r\nsize from the contractile properties of its fibrinous constituent.\r\nMoisture is forced from the thrombus in consequence of this shrinkage,\r\nand its dryness is increased by subsequent absorption through the wall\r\nto which it adheres.\r\n\r\nThe changes eventually taking place in the thrombus are known as\r\norganization, calcification, and softening.\r\n\r\nOrganization is the transformation of the thrombus into a mass of\r\nfibrous tissue. This is accomplished, according to the researches of\r\nBaumgarten,[21] by an outgrowth of endothelium from the intima of the\r\nvessel, the thrombus being absorbed as the growth of tissue advances.\r\nIn the case of a thrombus due to the ligation of a vessel, a\r\ngranulation-tissue also makes its way into the thrombus between the\r\nruptured coats, and the new-formed fibrous tissue which replaces the\r\nthrombus becomes vascularized through this granulation-tissue. The\r\nvascularization of thrombi surrounded by unbroken walls is most likely\r\nto result from the extension into the thickened intima of new-formed\r\nbranches of the vasa vasorum. Cohnheim claims that the organization of\r\nthe thrombus may take place solely through the entrance of migratory\r\ncells, without any active participation of elements of the vascular\r\nwall. The canal is thus obstructed or obliterated by a fibrous tissue,\r\nwhich is pigmented or not, as the pre-existing thrombus contained red\r\nblood-corpuscles or not. These, when present, become transformed into\r\ngranular or crystalline hæmatoidin, which may remain as a permanent\r\nconstituent of the new-formed tissue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Die sogenannte Organisation der Thrombus_, Leipzig,\r\n1877.]\r\n\r\nEven when the thrombus is completely obstructing at the outset, it is\r\nnot necessary that a total obliteration of the vessel should result\r\nfrom its organization. It not rarely happens, either before or after\r\nthe thrombus has yielded to the fibrous growth, in consequence of the\r\nshrinkage of the fibrin of the thrombus or of the contraction of the\r\nfibrous tissue replacing it, that gaps arise which become\r\ncommunicating canals. Through these the blood flows, and the vessel\r\nthus becomes only obstructed, not obliterated. The sieve-like tissue\r\nthus formed is spoken of as the result of a cavernous or sinus-like\r\ntransformation of the thrombus. The length of time necessary for the\r\nremoval of the thrombus and its replacement by fibrous tissue varies\r\nconsiderably. A vascularized granulation-tissue may be present within\r\na week, and in the course of a month the thrombus may have been wholly\r\nremoved, or a period of months may elapse and the thrombus and\r\ngranulation-tissue still be present side by side.\r\n\r\nThe calcification of a thrombus takes place when the latter becomes\r\nimpregnated with salts of calcium and magnesium. The condition may be\r\npresent in thrombi which are exposed to a rapidly-flowing arterial\r\nstream, as well as in those which lie in venous pockets outside the\r\ncourse of the direct current of blood. The well-known phlebolites are\r\nexamples of the latter variety. A calcified thrombus may be intimately\r\nunited to the vascular wall, the results of calcification and\r\norganization being associated. Calcification and, in particular,\r\norganization represent favorable {61} events in the history of\r\nthrombosis, as through their occurrence the process comes to an end,\r\nand disturbances, either local or remote, are prevented.\r\n\r\nThe softening of the thrombus, on the contrary, is always a source of\r\ndanger. This is partly due to the nature of the products of the\r\nsoftening, whether bland or septic, and partly to the mechanical\r\ndisturbances produced by the transfer of portions of the softened\r\nthrombus to remote parts of the body. All thrombi may become softened.\r\nWhen the process of organization advances normally, the softened parts\r\nare absorbed as rapidly as the formation of vascularized fibrous\r\ntissue progresses. If this formation is checked or stopped, the\r\nprocess of disintegration still continues. White corpuscles undergo\r\nfatty degeneration; red corpuscles give up their coloring matter and\r\nbecome converted, like the fibrin, into granules, and there results a\r\ngranular detritus. This is present as a viscid, semi-fluid material,\r\neither red, gray, or yellow, according to the color of the thrombus.\r\nThis simple softening is to be regarded as essentially chemical in\r\ncharacter, and begins at the oldest portion of the thrombus and\r\nadvances toward the periphery. Its products are capable of absorption\r\nwithout the production of serious disturbances, and are usually\r\nprevented from direct entrance into the blood-vessel containing the\r\nthrombus by the continuation of the latter from new coagulation or\r\ndeposition upon its surface. The thrombus is thus extended as the\r\nsoftening progresses.\r\n\r\nWhen the thrombus is comparatively free from red blood-corpuscles, the\r\nsoftened product, in consequence of its yellowish color, opacity, and\r\nviscidity, resembles pus. The so-called encysted abscesses projecting\r\ninto the cavity of the heart, from its wall, are parietal and globular\r\nthrombi, in the interior of which softening has occurred. This form of\r\nsoftening is called simple or bland, as it is free from any evidence\r\nof local suppuration, inflammation, or general constitutional\r\ndisturbance attributable to an absorption of poisonous material.\r\n\r\nSeptic softening is accompanied by general evidences of a\r\nblood-poisoning, and by the local phenomena of purulent inflammation.\r\nA suppurative thrombo-phlebitis or arteritis, occurs; that is, an\r\nacute inflammation of the wall of the vessel, corresponding in its\r\norigin to the seat of the thrombus, and characterized by the formation\r\nof pus. In the earliest stage the softened thrombus need not present\r\nproducts differing in appearance from those occurring in simple\r\nsoftening, but their effect is manifested by a rapidly-advancing\r\ninflammation of the vascular wall and by the evidence of septicæmia.\r\nInoculation with such material produces a group of symptoms classified\r\nunder the head of blood-poisoning.\r\n\r\nCohnheim lays special stress upon the presence of micrococci in the\r\nsoftened material, and it is generally agreed that the virulence of\r\nseptic softening is connected with, if not due to, the presence of\r\nmicrobia. A septic softening may be induced by besmearing, with septic\r\nmaterial, the outside of a blood-vessel containing a thrombus, and\r\nthis form of softening is usually associated with those conditions\r\nfavoring this relation. Such are the gangrenous wounds following\r\nsurgical operations, the putrid inflammatory processes affecting the\r\nuterine wall after childbirth, the offensive inflammations of the\r\nmiddle ear, and the like. It is possible for a septic softening to\r\noccur independently of such contiguous or continuous relations with\r\nthe surfaces of the body. It is considered, {62} however, that the\r\nmicrococci present in a softened thrombus must have obtained admission\r\nfrom without through one of the surfaces of the body, mucous or\r\ncutaneous, or through undiscovered abrasions of even intact surfaces\r\nof peculiar structure, as the alveolar wall or the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane. The thrombus is regarded as affording a favorable soil for\r\nthe growth and activity of the organism.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical effect of a thrombus varies according to the venous or\r\narterial seat of the same. Venous thrombi, as they are continued\r\ntoward the heart, tend to become completely obstructing thrombi. In\r\nmost parts of the body the venous anastomoses are so numerous that the\r\nobstruction of a vein is readily compensated for through the\r\ncollateral venous circulation. When such a compensation is prevented\r\nby an extension of the thrombus from branch to branch, and finally to\r\nthe trunk, an accumulation of blood in the peripheral veins must\r\nresult. The remote parts become swollen, from the distension of the\r\nvessels with blood and the transudation of liquid, and eventually\r\nsolid material from the blood. Venous thrombosis thus leads to oedema,\r\nand even hemorrhage. The more rapidly the obstructing thrombus\r\nextends, the earlier and more extreme is the oedema likely to become,\r\nwhile the slower the advance of the thrombus, the more favorable is\r\nthe opportunity for an enlargement of the collateral vessels through\r\nwhich a sufficient flow of blood is permitted to check oedema and\r\npreserve nutrition.\r\n\r\nLocal mechanical disturbances from arterial thrombi are scarcely\r\nperceptible till obstruction is produced, and the results of arterial\r\nobstruction will be mentioned in detail in connection with the\r\nphenomena of embolism. Cardiac thrombi may occasion local disturbances\r\nfrom interfering with the action of the valves of the heart. Those\r\nthrombi which are attached to the valves, especially when calcified,\r\nmay produce inflammation and aneurism of the opposed wall of the\r\nheart, by friction. The most frequent mechanical disturbance from the\r\nnon-obstructing parietal thrombi of the heart and arteries results\r\nfrom the detachment of fragments and their transfer as emboli to\r\nremote parts of the body.\r\n\r\nAn embolus is a foreign body in a blood-vessel, usually too large to\r\npass through the smallest capillaries, and the disturbances resulting\r\nfrom its presence are included under the term embolism. Although most\r\nemboli are detached portions of thrombi, any foreign body of suitable\r\nsize may become an embolus. Such are tissues, as the pulmonary elastic\r\nfibres, fragments of diseased valves of the heart and of the intima of\r\narteries, or portions of tumors growing into vascular canals. Others\r\nare globules of oil entering the torn veins when fat-tissue becomes\r\ncrushed, or air-bubbles admitted through veins either wounded by\r\ninstruments or opened after parturition by the dislodgment of their\r\nobstructing thrombi. Still others are granules of pigment derived from\r\nthe coloring-matter of the blood, as in melanæmia, or introduced from\r\nwithout, as india-ink and cinnabar. The echinococcus has been found as\r\nan embolus, and it is highly probable that the cysticercus, the\r\ntrichina, and other animal parasites may be disseminated as emboli\r\nover the body.\r\n\r\nVegetable parasites, like the bacterium and aspergillus, have also\r\nbeen included in the list, although the disturbances resulting from\r\ntheir presence are less due to mechanical obstruction than to\r\ncolonization and growth. The experimenter uses the most various\r\nobjects as emboli--bits {63} of wood, rubber, and glass, globules of\r\nmercury, fragments of tissue, etc. Emboli are to be regarded as of\r\narterial or venous origin. The arterial emboli are carried toward the\r\ncapillaries, while venous emboli are carried toward the heart. The\r\neffect of both is partly or wholly mechanical, and partly due to the\r\nspecific properties of the constituents.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical effect of an embolus is manifested by the obstruction\r\nit offers to the circulation, and the degree of the obstruction\r\ndepends upon the size, shape, and density of the embolus and the\r\nnature and size of the vessel obstructed. An embolus may be so large\r\nas to be unable to pass through the valvular orifices of the heart. A\r\nlong and narrow embolus might pass through a vessel which would not\r\nadmit one which was short and thick. A jagged and dense embolus, by\r\nrepeated blows or prolonged and forcible contact, might cause a\r\nweakening or rupture of the wall of a vessel, and thus produce an\r\naneurism. Certain vessels (the terminal arteries of Cohnheim) furnish\r\nthe sole supply of arterial blood to a district, and when they are\r\nobstructed, the results, to be mentioned later, differ widely from\r\nthose taking place where free vascular anastomoses exist. When a trunk\r\nbifurcates, the larger branch usually receives the embolus.\r\n\r\nVenous emboli are those which approach the heart by the peripheral\r\nveins of the body or the pulmonary veins, and the liver by the\r\nradicles of the portal vein. Emboli from the veins of the body are\r\ncarried through the right side of the heart, if not so large as to be\r\nstopped at the tricuspid or pulmonary opening. As they enter the\r\nlatter, they are carried along its course under the influence of\r\ngravity and the direction and force of the current, which are\r\ndetermined by the direction and relative size of the bifurcations of\r\nthe artery, the right primary branch being larger than the left.\r\nEventually, a point of the artery is reached whose diameter is less\r\nthan that of the embolus, and the latter is stopped. This point\r\nusually corresponds with a place of bifurcation, and the embolus\r\nfrequently rides the wall separating the branches.\r\n\r\nEmboli from the radicles of the portal vein owe their most frequent\r\norigin to thrombi associated with inflammatory processes in the\r\nintestine, especially of the cæcum and vermiform appendage, to\r\ninflammatory processes in the spleen and obstruction to the flow of\r\nblood through the splenic artery, or to inflammatory changes\r\nproceeding from the kidneys. Such venous emboli are carried toward the\r\nheart, but are stopped on the way by the intrahepatic branches of the\r\nportal vein.\r\n\r\nArterial emboli are those which enter the left side of the heart from\r\nthe lungs, which arise in the left ventricle or auricle, which may\r\npass through an open foramen ovale from the right auricle, or which\r\narise from the arterial wall. They are carried along the course of the\r\narterial circulation, and are distributed over the different regions\r\nand organs of the body. Usually following the more direct course of\r\nthe circulation, they are more likely to enter the abdominal aorta\r\nthan to be carried toward the brain or upper extremities. Embolism of\r\nthe carotids, especially of the left carotid, is more likely to ensue\r\nthan embolism of the subclavians. Embolism of the coronary arteries is\r\nrare, while embolism of the splenic artery, the left renal and left\r\niliac arteries, is comparatively common, and in the order mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhen an embolus is found, or embolism suspected, the source is always\r\n{64} to be searched for in those regions from which the affected part\r\nreceives its blood. The source of arterial and portal emboli is\r\nusually found with ease, while the pulmonary embolus may come from so\r\nwide a region, the body-veins, that much time may be spent before its\r\nplace of origin is discovered. An appreciation of the laws of the\r\ntransfer of emboli renders such a discovery almost certain.\r\n\r\nWhen the embolus reaches a point beyond which it cannot pass, the\r\nresulting disturbance depends essentially, as shown by Cohnheim, upon\r\nthe presence or absence of arterial anastomoses beyond the place of\r\nobstruction. He gives the name terminal arteries to those which have\r\nno anastomosing arterial branches. These are met with in the spleen,\r\nkidneys, lungs, brain, and retina. If the obstructed artery is not\r\nterminal, the embolus may produce no further disturbance, the\r\ncollateral supply of blood through the anastomoses sufficing for the\r\nnutrition and function of the part. If, however, the vessel is a\r\nterminal artery, and the embolus is completely obstructing, the supply\r\nof arterial blood must be wholly cut off from the region beyond the\r\nseat of obstruction.\r\n\r\nIf the embolus does not completely obstruct at once, it soon becomes\r\nsufficiently large for this result to ensue in consequence of a\r\nsecondary coagulation. The rider assumes legs extending into the\r\narterial branches beyond the place of obstruction, and a body which\r\nextends backward in the course of the circulation to the nearest\r\nbranch. The result of the total obstruction of the vessel is to cut\r\noff the admission of arterial blood, producing a local anæmia. The\r\ncontraction of the elastic tissues of the part propels toward the\r\ncapillaries a certain quantity of the blood in the vessels beyond the\r\npoint of obstruction, till this force becomes neutralized by the\r\nblood-pressure in the vessels surrounding the obstructed region. The\r\nanæmic part may subsequently become engorged with blood; it may die, a\r\nregion of anæmic necrosis resulting, or the dead portion may become\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\nThe engorgement of the obstructed territory has received the name of\r\nhemorrhagic infarction. A solid, wedge-shaped mass of a reddish-brown\r\ncolor is present, whose shape is due to the arborescent branching of\r\nthe terminal arteries. According to Cohnheim, the engorgement of the\r\nregion with blood takes place from venous regurgitation into the\r\nobstructed part, till the intravenous pressure is overcome by the\r\nresistance of the tissues in the region affected. The capillaries and\r\nlarger vessels thus become distended, and an escape of liquid and\r\nsolid constituents of the blood takes place. If the veins are provided\r\nwith valves, or the venous regurgitant current is opposed by gravity,\r\nthe hemorrhagic infarction is prevented or greatly impeded.\r\n\r\nLitten,[22] on the contrary, who has furnished a recent contribution\r\nto this subject, claims that the hemorrhagic results of embolism are\r\nnot accomplished through venous regurgitation, unless increased venous\r\ntension is produced by coughing, vomiting, and like efforts. His\r\nexperiments lead him to maintain that arterial blood from surrounding\r\ntissues is supplied to the obstructed region through the anastomosing\r\ncapillaries. The force is not sufficient to drive the blood through\r\nthe capillaries into the veins beyond, but an accumulation takes place\r\nin the capillaries, which become dilated and distended. The escape of\r\nblood-corpuscles and {65} serum then takes place, the more freely, as\r\nWeigert[23] suggests, the larger and more numerous are the\r\npre-existing spaces in the organ. Hence the infarction becomes the\r\nmost characteristically developed in such organs as the lungs and\r\nspleen. Causes which obstruct the venous flow, as well as those which\r\nincrease the arterial tension, promote the hemorrhagic infarction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Untersuchungen über den hemorrhagischen Infarct.,\r\netc._, Berlin, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1878, lxxii. 250.]\r\n\r\nA necrosis of the part whose direct arterial supply is cut off takes\r\nplace when the structure of the organ affected is such that the\r\nadmission of arterial blood is wholly interfered with. This is the\r\ncase in the heart and kidneys, and to a less extent in the spleen. The\r\nopportunity is presented for the diffusion of a fibrinogenous fluid,\r\nlymph or blood-serum, through the cells of the organ which contains\r\nthe other essentials for coagulation, and the dead part presents the\r\ncharacteristics attributed by Weigert[24] to death from clotting of\r\nthe protoplasm, coagulative or ischæmic necrosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Ibid._, 1880, lxxix. 87.]\r\n\r\nEmbolism of the cerebral arteries produces softening of the brain, not\r\na hemorrhagic infarction or a yellowish necrosis. Weigert attributes\r\nthis result, on the one hand, to the absence in the brain of abundant\r\ncells from which are to be had the ferment and fibrino-plastic\r\nmaterial necessary for coagulation, and, on the other, to the closure\r\nof the spaces into which blood might collect by the rapid swelling of\r\nthe tissues from the exuded lymph.\r\n\r\nThe hemorrhagic results of embolism are also met with in obstruction\r\nof branches of the mesenteric artery, which is considered by Litten,\r\nat least from its function and in connection with its sluggish\r\ncurrent, to correspond with a terminal artery.\r\n\r\nIf the patient outlives these more mechanical results of embolism, the\r\nlocal changes taking place are those tending to remove the\r\nextravasated blood or the dead tissues. The embolus has become an\r\nobstructing thrombus, and its removal is accomplished in the manner\r\nalready stated in connection with the subject of thrombosis. The\r\nwedge-shaped nodule of hemorrhagic infarction becomes decolorized\r\nthrough the absorption, in part, of the blood-pigment. That portion\r\nwhich is not absorbed remains at the site of the original lesion as\r\ngranular or crystalline blood-pigment. A granulation-tissue is formed\r\nat the periphery, which extends into the infarcted region, very much\r\nas the endothelial and vascularized growth extends into a thrombus.\r\nEventually, a patch of cicatricial tissue remains as the sole\r\nindication of the previous disturbance. This termination is rather\r\nsuggested for the hemorrhagic infarctions of the lungs. The results\r\nare more apparent and more easily demonstrated in the case of the\r\nanæmic necroses, and the somewhat irregular depressions with\r\nwedge-shaped scars, seen upon the surface of the spleen or kidneys,\r\ncall attention to the probable nature of the process giving rise to\r\nthese results. A source of embolism must also be associated, that\r\nthese scars may be regarded as of embolic origin. The embolic\r\nsoftenings of the brain are likewise represented in after years by\r\nlosses of substance. The superficial, yellow patches or localized\r\noedematous blebs, with corresponding atrophy of the convolutions\r\nbeneath, call attention to a nutritive disturbance, as do cyst-like\r\ncavities in the deeper parts of the brain. Here, too, a source of\r\nembolism must be found, that {66} the local destruction of tissue may\r\nbe attributed to embolic obstruction of vascular territories.\r\n\r\nWhen the embolus arises from a septic thrombus, the results differ\r\nfrom those above described. The embolus then carries not only\r\nmechanical possibilities, but also a virulent action. The latter is\r\nmanifested by the rapid production of local inflammatory disturbances,\r\nas circumscribed abscesses and gangrenous destruction of tissue. Since\r\nemboli are frequently lodged near the surfaces of organs, a septic\r\npleurisy, pericarditis, or peritonitis is the usual result of the\r\ndissemination of the virus contained in the embolus. This virus is\r\nsimilar in character to that found in septic softening of the\r\nthrombus, and, like it, is intimately connected with the presence of\r\nmicrobia. Whether the latter are specific in character, as maintained\r\nby Klebs and others, or whether they are to be included among those\r\nassociated with putrefactive processes, still remains an open\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of thrombosis obviously depend upon the resulting\r\nobstruction to the circulation of blood, and in the case of primitive\r\nthrombi are gradual in their occurrence. The degree of mechanical\r\nobstruction is determined by the nature of the thrombus, whether\r\nparietal or obstructing, and by that of the vessel, whether provided\r\nwith anastomoses sufficient to permit a compensatory collateral\r\ncirculation or not. In the former case, if the thrombus is small and\r\ndeep-seated, there may be no symptoms to indicate its presence. When\r\nthe collateral circulation is insufficient to remove the blood from a\r\nregion whose efferent venous trunk is completely filled with a\r\nthrombus, the phenomena of stagnation are produced. The part becomes\r\noedematous, and red blood-corpuscles escape from the distended vessel.\r\nIf the obstructed vein is superficial, the seat of the thrombus is\r\nindicated by the resistance and sensitiveness of the part.\r\nCharacteristic disturbances of function are associated with thrombosis\r\nof the various organs of the body. If the cerebral sinuses are\r\naffected, mental disturbances arise; if a cardiac thrombosis is\r\npresent, it is frequently accompanied by irregularity and feebleness\r\nof the heart. When the portal and renal veins are obstructed,\r\nfunctional disturbances arise in the parts from which they receive\r\ntheir blood.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of embolism, like those of arterial thrombosis, are\r\nprimarily due to anæmia. Suddenness is their characteristic in\r\nembolism, while they are gradual and progressive in the case of\r\nthrombosis. An embolic anæmia is complete or incomplete according to\r\nthe terminal or anastomosing character of the obstructed vessel. The\r\neffect of the anæmia is to stop or check the function of the part, and\r\nvaries according to the size and situation of the vessel. Hemiplegia,\r\nor perhaps aphasia or other evidence of localized disturbance, follows\r\ncentral embolism; angina pectoris, with a disturbed cardiac action,\r\nresults from embolism of the coronary artery. Sudden suffocative\r\nsymptoms, with open air-passages, suggest embolism of the larger\r\nbranches of the pulmonary artery. A considerable hæmaturia often\r\nexcites suspicion of an embolism of the renal artery, the hemorrhage\r\ncoming from the vessels in the neighborhood of the obstructed region.\r\nEmbolism of a large artery of an extremity is often localized by the\r\nsensation of a blow at the part, to be followed by absent pulsation,\r\npallor, and coldness of the region beyond the place of obstruction.\r\n\r\n{67} The symptoms of the subsequent effects of thrombosis and embolism\r\nare to be inferred from what has already been stated with regard to\r\nthe nature of the possible lesions. To enter into their detailed\r\nconsideration would demand more space than is permitted, and would\r\nmodify an established sequence or necessitate a repetition, which is\r\nundesirable in a systematic treatise.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffusions.\r\n\r\nThe various fluids of the body are derived from without, and admitted\r\ninto the blood-vessels. The physiological transudation through the\r\nwalls of these vessels, in the main modified serum, becomes lymph as\r\nit appears in the several lymph-spaces. From the latter the transuded\r\nfluid either returns through the lymph-vessels to the blood-current or\r\nmakes its appearance upon surfaces as secretions. These are variously\r\nmodified as they pass through the specific cells of glands or as they\r\nare met with in the several closed cavities of the body.\r\n\r\nThe transudations thus occurring may vary in quantity within certain\r\nlimits, the latter being somewhat indefinite, owing to the\r\ndifficulties in the way of exactly measuring the fluid transuded. The\r\ngreater part of this transudation is represented by the quantity of\r\nlymph flowing through the main lymph-trunk, and of the secretion from\r\nthe glandular surfaces of a given region of the body; but that\r\ntransuded fluid is not included which may return to the blood-vessels\r\nwithout being carried into the general lymph-current or secreted from\r\na gland. Such a direct return may be considered to take place whenever\r\nthe pressure upon the outside of the vessel wall is greater than that\r\nwithin the latter, or when the chemical composition of the fluids on\r\nthe two sides of the filter permits endosmosis as well as exosmosis.\r\nThis varying relation in the direction of the current through the\r\nvessel wall is likely to be of frequent, if not constant, occurrence\r\nin connection with the physiological processes taking place throughout\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThe undue accumulation of the transudation in the various closed\r\ncavities of the body is known as dropsy, and the fluid present is\r\nregarded as an effusion or an exudation. These terms are often applied\r\nsomewhat vaguely, now being used as synonymous, again as representing\r\ndifferent conditions of the transudation, which are attributed to the\r\nvarying conditions of its accumulation.\r\n\r\nExudation is more generally used when an inflammatory process is the\r\ncause of the increased transudation, while effusion is more strictly\r\nassociated with causes other than inflammatory. In the present\r\nconsideration this etiological distinction will be maintained.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the conditions under which pathological accumulations of\r\nfluid, whether effusions or exudations, may arise, it is desirable to\r\nbear in mind the essential conditions which prevail in the occurrence\r\nof transudation, since the former are likewise chiefly derived from\r\nthe blood and are transuded through the walls of its vessels. These\r\nconditions are largely dependent upon the laws governing the diffusion\r\nof substances through an animal membrane, the vascular wall\r\nrepresenting the filter. As a living membrane its relation is\r\ndependent upon vital as well as {68} physical conditions, and the\r\nformer produce certain important modifications in the physical process\r\nof filtration.\r\n\r\nThe transudation through the vessels takes place chiefly through those\r\nwith the thinnest walls, the capillaries, although it is probable that\r\na certain degree of transudation may also occur through the walls of\r\nthe smallest veins. The causes which are instrumental in promoting the\r\ncirculation of the blood--viz. the contraction and dilatation of the\r\nheart, the contraction of the arteries, the inspiratory action of the\r\nthorax, and muscular movements throughout the body--are also essential\r\nin producing the flow of lymph; and the existence of pressure upon the\r\nhæmic side of the filter is the first feature of importance in\r\noccasioning the transudation. The constant removal of the transudation\r\nfrom the outer side results from the pressure being less in this\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, an increase in the quantity of blood in the vessels\r\nis not necessarily productive of any considerable increase in the\r\nfluid transuded. Cohnheim calls attention to the experiments of Worm\r\nMüller, which show that a plethoric condition may readily be produced\r\nby the injection of quantities of blood into the circulation of\r\nanimals, the amount of which cannot exceed twice the volume of the\r\nanimal's blood without producing death. Although a temporary increase\r\nof the blood-pressure results, a return to the normal quickly follows.\r\nThis is permitted by the propulsion of the excess of blood into the\r\ncapillaries and veins, which become consequently distended, especially\r\nthose of the abdominal organs. There is no increased transudation\r\ncorresponding with the quantity of fluid introduced, nor is there any\r\nconsiderable distension of the blood-vessels of the skin, subcutaneous\r\nor intermuscular connective tissue. Such experiments show no permanent\r\nincrease in the blood-pressure within the large veins if there is no\r\nobstruction to the admission of venous blood into the heart,\r\npresumably owing to their capacity for considerable distension.\r\n\r\nAlthough experiments show that a simple plethora with great distension\r\nof the capillaries of the abdominal organs occasions no considerable\r\nincrease of transudation, a different result follows a hydræmic\r\nplethora[25] induced by the injection of immense quantities of salt\r\nwater into the blood-current--often six times as much liquid as the\r\nanimal had blood. Here, too, the arterial blood-pressure shows no\r\npermanent increase, nor does that within the large veins become\r\nperceptibly increased till enormous quantities of fluid are injected.\r\nThe blood flows through the vessels with increased rapidity in\r\nconsequence of the diminished friction of the diluted blood, and an\r\nincreased transudation begins at once. The various glands, salivary\r\nand gastro-intestinal, kidneys and liver, secrete more copiously, and\r\nthe flow of a dilute lymph from the thoracic duct becomes greatly\r\nincreased, while that from the cervical lymphatics becomes moderately\r\naccelerated. The lymph from the extremities, however, is no greater in\r\nquantity than that flowing from an animal in a perfectly normal\r\ncondition. The localization of the increased transudation from the\r\nblood-vessels is further characterized by the abundant accumulation of\r\nwatery fluid in all the abdominal organs and abdominal cavity, in the\r\nsalivary glands and surrounding connective tissue, while elsewhere in\r\nthe body the organs and tissues are almost invariably in the same\r\ncondition with {69} regard to moisture as are those of a healthy\r\nanimal under normal circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Cohnheim and Lichtheim, _Virchow's Archiv_, 1877, lxix.\r\n106.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of these experiments with reference to the causes of\r\nthe transudation of fluid from the blood is obvious. The pressure upon\r\nthe walls of the blood-vessels cannot become sufficiently increased to\r\nbe accompanied with augmented transudation until limits are reached\r\nwhich are beyond the possibilities of occurrence in the human body.\r\nWhen such limits are attained in animals, the increased pressure,\r\nhowever great it may be, does not suffice to produce a general\r\ntransudation, but one limited to the vessels of those parts of the\r\nbody whose normal function is connected with too abundant transudation\r\nof fluid. A simple hydræmic condition of brief duration has been\r\nproven, by experiment, insufficient to give rise to increased\r\ntransudation, neither increased secretion nor increased flow of lymph\r\ntaking place. The inference from these experiments is that an\r\nincreased transudation is more dependent upon conditions of the filter\r\nthan upon those of blood-pressure. The absence of any observable\r\nchanges in the filter leads to the assumption of an increased\r\npermeability, of physiological occurrence in certain parts of the\r\nbody, as the chief feature in the occurrence of increased\r\ntransudations.\r\n\r\nDropsy arises when the transudation is accumulated. As dropsical\r\naccumulations are transudations from the blood, essentially\r\nblood-serum with a diminished percentage of albumen, and as such\r\nblood-serum is practically lymph from its presence in the\r\nlymph-vessels, dropsical effusions are to be regarded as stagnant\r\nlymph. Such stagnations may be present in the small lymph-spaces\r\nwithin the connective tissue, or in the larger lymph-sacs, as the\r\nperitoneal, pleural, pericardial, and scrotal cavities. In like\r\nmanner, the stagnation may take place in the cavities of joints and in\r\nthose of the brain and cord, although the latter represent functional\r\nrather than structural lymph-canals.\r\n\r\nThe term oedema is applied to the accumulation in the\r\nconnective-tissue lymph-spaces in general, while the term anasarca is\r\nconfined to those cases where the subcutaneous lymph-spaces are\r\nconcerned. The accumulation in the great lymph-cavities is known as\r\nascites when peritoneal, hydrothorax when pleural, hydropericardium\r\nwhen pericardial, hydrocele when in the cavity of the tunica\r\nvaginalis, hydrocephalus if within the ventricles of the brain, and\r\nhydromyelocele when within the central canal of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of dropsical effusions may be considered as possibly\r\nresulting from an obstruction to the channels through which the\r\ntransudation should flow, or from insufficient force to overcome\r\nnormal obstructions, or from an abnormally increased transudation.\r\n\r\nLymph-channels are frequently obstructed, but no appreciable diffused\r\nretention of lymph results unless the thoracic duct is obstructed.\r\nThis rare affection is followed by enormous distension of the thoracic\r\nand abdominal portions of the parts beyond the stenosis. Ascites and\r\nhydrothorax may follow, but not necessarily any considerable oedema of\r\nthe peripheral parts of the body. As a result of the distension of the\r\nthoracic duct, rupture is not unlikely to take place, and the effused\r\nfluid contains chyle.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Quincke, _Deutsches Archiv für Klin. Med._, 1875, xvi.\r\n121.]\r\n\r\n{70} That the obstruction is not followed by oedema is attributable to\r\nthe innumerable anastomoses between the lymph-spaces, and also to the\r\nprobability that a part of the transuded fluid returns to the\r\nblood-vessels when the obstruction is impassable.\r\n\r\nThe forces necessary to promote the flow of lymph have already been\r\nmentioned, and their entire removal is inconsistent with life. A\r\ndiminution of their activity is more likely to result in a diminished\r\nflow of lymph than its accumulation, although a slowing of the\r\nlymph-current may represent a favoring element in the accumulation of\r\nan increased transudation.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of dropsy with unobstructed lymph-channels, and in the\r\npresence of efficient agencies in promoting the flow of lymph,\r\nindicates the importance of an increased transudation as the chief\r\nelement in the occurrence of a dropsical accumulation. An increased\r\ntransudation, with resulting oedema, is readily produced by preventing\r\nthe flow of blood from a part, and may be directly observed with the\r\nmicroscope. Cohnheim states that after a sudden venous obstruction, in\r\ncase an efficient collateral circulation does not interfere, the\r\ncapillaries and small veins become distended with stagnant blood and\r\nappear as masses of red blood-corpuscles. This distension results from\r\nthe continuance of the arterial flow into the capillaries of the\r\nobstructed region under a pressure which is only neutralized by the\r\nresistance of the tissues and the transudation from the capillaries.\r\nSotnitschewsky[27] shows that a concurrent paralysis of the vaso-motor\r\nnerves, as claimed by Ranvier, is unnecessary. The transudation\r\nthrough the capillary wall is increased, the flow of lymph from the\r\npart is accelerated, and oedema arises when the transudation is so\r\nmuch augmented that the calibre of the lymph-vessels is insufficient\r\nfor its removal; and the greater this insufficiency the greater is the\r\noedema. With the continuance of the arterial flow and intravenous\r\nresistance, red blood-corpuscles are forced through the filter, and\r\nform an important constituent of the effusion from venous stagnation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1879, lxxvii. 85.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of an increased pressure upon the capillary\r\nwall is obvious from the experiment referred to, there is no increased\r\narterial pressure--rather a diminution--and the important element in\r\noccasioning the increased permeability of the capillary wall is the\r\nobstruction to the outflow of venous blood from the oedematous region.\r\nIn consequence of the latter the arterial flow is followed by\r\nincreased transudation.\r\n\r\nDropsies resulting from venous obstruction, as well as those following\r\nan obstruction of the thoracic duct or its branches, or of the several\r\nlymphatics of a part, are classified as mechanical dropsies. That from\r\nvenous obstruction is the most frequent, and its seat may lie in the\r\ncourse of venous trunks or in the heart, lungs, or liver. The venous\r\nobstruction must be so situated that the stagnant blood is unable to\r\nfind a ready escape through collateral branches. The more sudden and\r\ncomplete it is, the more likely is the effusion to contain\r\nconsiderable numbers of red blood-corpuscles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the element of venous stagnation in producing increased\r\ntransudation, the condition of the filter is of importance. The\r\noccurrence of oedema in chronic diseases, especially of the kidneys,\r\nand in those attended with protracted suppuration, continued\r\nhemorrhage, and the {71} rapid growth of tumors, has usually been\r\nattributed to the watery condition of the blood, with a diminution of\r\nthe albumen. Cohnheim, however, suggests that the condition of the\r\nvessel wall is of more importance than the contents as the immediate\r\ncause of the increased transudation. The more or less protracted\r\naction of various agents--temperature, insufficient oxygen, and\r\ndiminished albumen--is likely to so modify the condition of the\r\nendothelium as to favor an increased permeability of the wall.\r\nExperiments show that a simple acute hydræmia produces no increased\r\ntransudation, and that a chronic hydræmia, if connected with dropsy,\r\nis likely to be influential by increasing the permeability of the\r\nwall. Even in those cases where a hydræmia and an oedema co-exist, the\r\nlocalization of the latter is favored by obvious disturbances of the\r\nfunction of the capillary walls, as in case of the cutaneous oedema\r\nafter scarlatina. In like manner, a feeble heart, favoring venous\r\nstagnation, and gravitation are of importance, as general causes, in\r\npromoting dropsy in hydræmic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of the occurrence of oedema through nervous influence\r\nis not to be denied. The localized and fleeting oedema of urticaria\r\nand erythema, the swollen lip and tongue in connection with digestive\r\ndisturbances, are not to be explained by the two main factors of\r\noedema--viz. venous stagnation and increased permeability of the\r\nvascular walls. Cohnheim refers to the rapid occurrence of oedema of\r\nthe tongue as a result of irritation of the lingual nerve, and oedema\r\nis known to occur rapidly in cases of acute myelitis. A similar result\r\nfollows the experimental destruction of the spinal cord, although the\r\nmechanism of its production is not apparent.\r\n\r\nDropsies are subdivided, as regards their distribution, into general\r\nand local forms. The causes producing the two varieties are\r\nessentially those already described. The causes of all local dropsies\r\nare not always to be regarded as the same. Regions which are the seat\r\nof mechanical dropsies are often affected by inflammation, with\r\nabundant serous exudation--the so-called inflammatory dropsy. The\r\nproperties of the effusion and exudation are quite different, the\r\nformer having a small percentage of albumen, but few leucocytes, with\r\na corresponding absence of fibrin, and few or many red\r\nblood-corpuscles. The exudation, on the contrary, is highly\r\nalbuminous, though less so than the blood-plasma; it contains numerous\r\nleucocytes and much fibrin; under ordinary circumstances there are but\r\nfew red blood-corpuscles.\r\n\r\nThe local dropsies are often characterized by special terms. Hydrops\r\nex vacuo is applied to the collections of fluid found in closed\r\ncavities with unyielding walls, as the cranium and thorax, or to the\r\nrecurrence of fluid in cavities from which the same has been rapidly\r\nremoved, in the absence of inflammatory disturbances. Collateral\r\noedema is usually applied to the association of oedema with\r\ninflammatory disturbances, and represents an extension of the\r\ninflammatory process to the region concerned. Oedema of the glottis\r\nand circumscribed oedema of the lung are instances. The term\r\nhypostatic oedema is often used to designate the association of oedema\r\nand inflammation, the former caused by the latter, and to indicate the\r\neffect of gravitation in the localization of oedema from the general\r\ncauses already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAnother localized oedema of interest, from its frequent occurrence and\r\n{72} importance, is oedema of the lungs, often taking place toward the\r\nend of life, at times quite suddenly. This form has usually been\r\nattributed to increased transudation from arterial congestion or\r\nvenous stagnation. The former view is directly refuted by the\r\nexperiments of Welch,[28] who offers the explanation now accepted.\r\nWith the obliteration of three-fourths of the arterial supply to the\r\nlungs of the animals experimented upon, no oedema resulted from the\r\nassumed collateral fluxion into the branches of the pulmonary artery\r\nwhich were left open. The obliteration of the same area of venous\r\ndistribution was necessary before the occurrence of oedema. Oedema of\r\nthe lungs was further found to result from a ligature of the aorta\r\nnear the heart. The comparative frequency of oedema of the lungs in\r\nman, and the rarity of such extreme mechanical disturbances as those\r\nproduced experimentally, led Welch to paralyze the left ventricle. The\r\nconditions as regards the pulmonary circulation then corresponded with\r\nthose mentioned as causes for oedema from venous obstruction. The\r\ncontinued action of the right ventricle forced blood into the\r\npulmonary capillaries, where it was compelled to accumulate in\r\nconsequence of the inability of the left ventricle to receive and\r\nexpel it. Welch consequently regards the immediate cause of this form\r\nof pulmonary oedema as a predominant weakness of the left ventricle. A\r\nweak heart does not suffice for the production of the oedema, since\r\nthis condition is not found when both ventricles are alike enfeebled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1878, lxxii. 375.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDegenerations.\r\n\r\nThe degenerations represent disturbances in the nutrition of the\r\ntissues of the body, in consequence of which their functions become\r\nimpaired, if not destroyed. The latter result obviously attends the\r\ndeath of cells, which may occur in the course of the degeneration. The\r\nprocesses concerned are called necrobiotic by Virchow, as they\r\nrepresent vital processes leading to death. Although in many of them\r\nthe cell is decaying during their continuance, its recovery is\r\npossible with the disappearance of the conditions which have\r\ntransformed physiological into pathological processes. The\r\ndegenerations affect intercellular substance as well as cells, and are\r\ncalled metamorphoses, infiltrations, or degenerations, as a\r\ntransformation of normal into abnormal material, or the addition of\r\nextraneous substances, or the functional impairment of the part\r\nassumes the greatest prominence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cloudy Swelling, Albuminoid Infiltration, Granular Degeneration,\r\nParenchymatous Degeneration._\r\n\r\nOf the various modifications in the appearance of cells under\r\npathological conditions, there is none, perhaps, more commonly met\r\nwith than that known by the above terms. A granular appearance may be\r\nregarded as an essential characteristic of protoplasm, and is an\r\nattribute of cells of epithelial origin as well as of those which\r\nbelong to other groups of tissues. The abundance of granules present\r\nin a normal cell depends largely upon its shape, size, and situation.\r\nThese granules present various {73} relations to chemical agents, some\r\nbeing soluble in alcohol and ether, others in acids and alkalies, and\r\nmany of them, especially those met with in the form of degeneration\r\nnow being considered, show from the various reactions that they are of\r\nthe nature of albumen. Since their exact composition, in all\r\ninstances, is undetermined, they are called albuminoid, and when in\r\nexcess the cell is considered to be infiltrated with these granules,\r\nand the organ presents the appearances regarded as characteristic of\r\nan albuminoid infiltration. A granular cell becomes much more granular\r\nwhen it is thus infiltrated, and it is therefore a matter of\r\ndifficulty to recognize from the appearance of certain single cells,\r\nas those of the liver or kidney, whether or not the number of granules\r\npresent is abnormally increased. When, however, a large number of\r\ncells of any given organ contain more than the normal quantity of\r\nthese albuminoid granules, the appearance of the organ becomes\r\nmodified. In extreme cases the latter is swollen, doughy in\r\nconsistency, with ill-defined structural details, and in all instances\r\npresents an opaque appearance. The term cloudy swelling is thus purely\r\ndescriptive, and was applied by Virchow to designate the optical\r\nappearances of the condition in question. The granules, which\r\ndisappear on the addition of acids and alkalies, are apparently either\r\nadded to the cell or result from a precipitation within the same.\r\n\r\nFrequently associated with these albuminoid granules are others,\r\ndistinctly recognizable as globules of fat. An apparent increase of\r\nnuclei is often observed, and in certain organs, as the kidneys, the\r\ncells seem less coherent than is normally the case. The study of this\r\ncondition in the kidneys is further of interest as indicating that the\r\nborder-line between a parenchymatous degeneration and a parenchymatous\r\ninflammation is purely arbitrary. From similar exciting causes there\r\nmay be associated, with the described alterations of the epithelial\r\nlining of the tubes, the exudation of albumen, the formation of casts,\r\nthe desquamation of epithelium, and the presence of leucocytes within\r\nthe tubules.\r\n\r\nWhen the macroscopic changes are of moderate degree, and the\r\ndisturbance of function relatively slight, while the concurrent\r\nalterations elsewhere, from the simultaneous action of the same cause,\r\nare predominant and characteristic of the disease, the condition is\r\nconveniently regarded as a degeneration occurring in the course of the\r\nlatter, rather than an inflammation. The latter term, on the contrary,\r\nis to be applied when the granular infiltration of the cells is\r\nassociated with other evidences of an inflammatory exudation, and when\r\nthe pathological disturbances are to be directly attributed to the\r\nparenchymatous changes.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to speak of cloudy swelling as a nutritive change, and\r\nthe condition may be induced by those causes which interfere with the\r\nnutrition of parts or of the whole of an organ. Many authorities\r\nregard this granular or parenchymatous degeneration as closely allied\r\nto fatty degeneration, since many of the causes which produce the one\r\noccasion the other. The former is often spoken of as an earlier stage\r\nof the latter, from the frequent association of the albuminoid\r\ngranules with numerous globules of fat as a result of the more\r\nprolonged or more intense action of a given cause.\r\n\r\nOrgans which give evidence of a granular degeneration contain, as a\r\nrule, a diminished quantity of blood. This feature is usually\r\nattributed to the pressure of the swollen cells upon capillary\r\nblood-vessels. The {74} anæmic organ obviously becomes still more\r\ncloudy, gray, and opaque in appearance from the diminished quantity or\r\nimpoverished quality of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe granular degenerations of the heart, liver, and kidneys, as a\r\nwhole, usually occur simultaneously, and afford a most important means\r\nfor the post-mortem recognition of the infective diseases. The\r\ncondition is therefore to be looked for in the exanthemata, especially\r\nin small-pox and scarlet fever, also in erysipelas, septicæmia in its\r\nmanifold forms, diphtheria, typhoid and typhus fevers, cerebro-spinal\r\nmeningitis, etc. A common feature in all these cases is the occurrence\r\nof fever, and it has been claimed that this element is the cause of\r\nthe degeneration. In opposition to this view is the well-known fact of\r\nits presence in afebrile cases of poisoning from carbonic oxide, and\r\nits absence in certain cases of pneumonia and exposure to high\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nThe universal occurrence of cloudy swelling in fatal cases of the\r\naffections above mentioned leads to the inference of its presence in\r\nthose instances terminating in recovery without obvious permanent\r\nimpairment of the organs and tissues concerned. It is therefore agreed\r\nthat the process may terminate in resolution--_i.e._ in a\r\ndisappearance of the excess of granular material. On the other hand,\r\nits association, under circumstances, with fatty degeneration suggests\r\nas extremely probable that the latter condition may represent a result\r\nof the albuminoid infiltration. Even if this more serious issue\r\nexists, the possibilities are still at hand for an absorption of the\r\ndegenerated material and a restitution of the destroyed protoplasm.\r\nThe effect upon the individual is evidently determined by the\r\npersistence and dissemination of the condition, which, in turn, are\r\ncontrolled by the immediate cause and the peculiarities of the\r\nindividual acted upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fatty Metamorphosis, Fatty Degeneration, and Fatty Infiltration._\r\n\r\nThe fat which is present within the body under physiological\r\nconditions owes its origin primarily to the food taken. A diet which\r\nis abundantly fatty furnishes a direct source for much of the fat\r\nwhich appears accumulated in the various organs and tissues. Although\r\nit may now appear that such a statement needs but little confirmation,\r\nit is not long since the opinion prevailed that nearly all the fat in\r\nthe body came from the hydrocarbons of the food. This seemed all the\r\nmore plausible as the herbivora readily accumulated fat, although\r\ntheir diet might contain this element in very small quantities.\r\nHofmann[29] made a decisive experiment with reference to the origin of\r\nfat from fatty food by feeding a dog, made lean by starvation, with\r\nbacon in abundance, but with little meat. In the course of a few days\r\nthe greater part of the fat introduced was deposited within the\r\ntissues of the animal. Other experimenters have arrived at a similar\r\nresult, and it can no longer be questioned that fat, accumulated\r\nwithin the body, owes its origin chiefly to the absorption of fat from\r\nthe food taken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Zeitschrift für Biologie_, 1872, viii. 153.]\r\n\r\nAnother source for the fat of the body has long been\r\nsuggested--namely, the albuminates of the food. In the admirable\r\narticle on the formation of fat by Voit,[30] from which most of the\r\ninformation herein {75} presented is derived, it is claimed that he\r\nand Pettenkofer were the first to prove the origin of fat in the body,\r\nunder normal conditions, from albumen. This proof was an inference,\r\nhowever, although presenting a high degree of probability. Valuable\r\nevidence in the same direction was furnished by Kemmerich, who found\r\nthat the milk of a cow during a certain period held more fat than was\r\ncontained in the food; Subbotin and Voit have shown that more milk is\r\nsecreted the richer the diet in albumen. Still other observers have\r\nfurnished more decisive proof that fat is formed from albuminates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Hermann's Handbuch der Physiologie_, 1881, vi. 1, 235.]\r\n\r\nTwo sources for fat in the body under physiological conditions are\r\nthus recognized: 1, the free fat in the food; 2, the fat derived from\r\nthe decomposition of the albuminates of the food.\r\n\r\nVoit admits the possibility of the hydrocarbons serving as a third\r\nsource, although this possibility is unnecessary in most cases. Should\r\ninstances arise, however, where other sources for fat are found\r\ninsufficient, the hydrocarbons must be regarded as filling the gap.\r\n\r\nFat which is taken into the body is considered to be either consumed\r\nor stored. That which is stored is chiefly accumulated in the great\r\nreservoirs--viz. the subcutaneous and perinephritic fat tissue, the\r\nmesentery, omentum, and bone-marrow--although it may be found\r\nelsewhere, in the fluids and tissues of the body. This accumulation\r\nserves as a source to be drawn from in case of need, and is called\r\nupon where the easily-decomposed soluble albumen is disposed of by the\r\nfunctional activity of the cells. An acting muscle demands food for\r\nits work, and consumes first the soluble albumen, then the fat. An\r\nexcessive waste of fat is delayed by the decomposition of\r\nhydrocarbons, but the demands may become so great that albumen, fat,\r\nand hydrocarbons are consumed more rapidly and constantly than they\r\ncan be supplied. It being, therefore, admitted that fat is formed from\r\nthe albuminates, as well as from the fat of the food, the question\r\nreadily presents itself whether fat may not be formed from the fixed\r\nalbuminates of the body, especially from those contained within its\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in the secretion of sebum the superficial cells\r\nof the sebaceous follicles contain fat in great quantity, while the\r\ndeeper layers are comparatively free from any appearances indicative\r\nof the presence of fat. It is further admitted that when pus is\r\nretained for a time the individual corpuscles contain fat-drops in\r\nquantity and become transformed into fatty granular corpuscles.\r\nEventually, the pus is transformed into a detritus in which fat-drops\r\nare found in great number.\r\n\r\nSimilar appearances may be present in the protoplasm of muscular\r\ntissue, the cells of the liver, kidneys, and gastric glands, when\r\npoisonous doses of phosphorus or arsenic are given. The occurrence of\r\nan acute fatty metamorphosis of the cells of various organs in\r\nnew-born children has repeatedly been observed. The presence of fat in\r\nvarious organs of the body in pernicious anæmia, and in the heart in\r\nconnection with stenosis of the coronary artery, is universally\r\nrecognized. The abuse of alcohol, long-continued obstruction to the\r\nflow of venous blood, exposure to high temperatures, are all known to\r\nbe conditions in connection with which fat-drops are found in the\r\nvarious cells of the body. The effects of poisoning with phosphorus\r\nand arsenic are of special importance, as showing that the abundance\r\nof fat present in the cells represents a result of the degeneration of\r\nthese cells, {76} since it takes place when the animal is deprived of\r\nfood. Although there is an evident destruction of albumen, there is\r\nalso a diminished elimination of carbonic acid and admission of\r\noxygen. These facts are explicable on the ground that the fat present\r\nis not consumed, and the accumulation in the cells is evidence of this\r\nlack of consumption. The fat is not simply stored, as none is taken\r\nin, nor is any food received from which fat might be formed. Its\r\npresence, therefore, must be regarded as due to degeneration.\r\n\r\nSince fat may be formed in the body as a result of the metamorphosis\r\nof cell-protoplasm, it is desirable to ascertain whether there are any\r\nmeans by which stored fat may be distinguished from that present as\r\nthe result of a degeneration of the cell. The term fatty infiltration\r\nhas been used to indicate the presence of stored fat, the latter being\r\nregarded as simply taken into the cell and retained for a longer or\r\nshorter time, without any necessary interference with other functions\r\npossessed by the cell.\r\n\r\nIn fatty degeneration, on the contrary, it is considered that the\r\nquantity of fat present indicates a corresponding diminution in the\r\nalbuminates of the cell, and is connected with a diminution in the\r\nfunction of the latter, all the greater the more abundant the fat.\r\n\r\nIt is found that in fatty infiltration, as a rule, the fat is present\r\nin large drops, the size of the cell being increased in proportion to\r\nthe quantity of fat present. Although there may be several drops\r\npresent, they tend to run together, as is suggested by their different\r\nsize, varying proximity, and the constant presence of a considerable\r\nquantity of protoplasm. In organs, on the contrary, whose function is\r\nseriously, even fatally, impaired, the fat, as a rule, assumes rather\r\na granular form. Many minute fat-drops are present, and the cell is\r\nnot particularly, if at all, increased in size. The more abundant the\r\nfat the less the protoplasm. Appearances are met with indicating a\r\ntransition between cells with few fat-granules and those with many.\r\n\r\nIf the morphological appearances of fatty infiltration and of fatty\r\ndegeneration were constant, there would obviously be little or no\r\ndifficulty in determining the nature of the process manifested by the\r\npresence of fat. The exceptions occur both in fatty infiltration and\r\nfatty degeneration. In the cells of the liver of an animal poisoned\r\nwith phosphorus fat makes its appearance in large drops, while in the\r\nheart and kidneys of the same animal the fat is present in a granular\r\nform.\r\n\r\nDuring absorption from the intestine in the process of digestion fat\r\nis present in the epithelium in a finely granular form. When digestion\r\nis completed fat is no longer met with in these cells. The presence of\r\nlarge or small drops, therefore, cannot be regarded as a sufficient\r\ntest of the origin of the fat. It is of equal, if not greater,\r\nimportance to bear in mind the organ concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the heart, liver, kidneys, and gastric glands, as well as\r\nelsewhere, with the exception, perhaps, of the mammary gland, the\r\npresence of many small fat-drops in the cells indicates a degeneration\r\nof its protoplasm. The presence of large fat-drops, on the contrary,\r\nin the organs and tissues, with the exception of the liver, indicates\r\nan infiltration. Large fat-drops, then, may be present in the cells of\r\nthe liver as the result of an infiltration or of a degeneration. In\r\norder to form a satisfactory opinion of the {77} nature of the\r\nappearances in the liver in doubtful cases, it is important to note\r\nthe condition of those organs which may be simultaneously in a state\r\nof fatty degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of fat under physiological conditions is obviously\r\nbrought about, on the one hand, by those causes which permit a free\r\nintroduction, absorption, and deposition, and, on the other, by those\r\nwhich check its oxidation or elimination with the secretions of the\r\nbody, as the bile, in which it may be present to a considerable\r\nextent. A diet rich in fat, or in albuminates readily converted into\r\nfat, offers a favorable element for the absorption of fat by the\r\nhealthy individual. If the organism demands but little of this fat for\r\noxidation, as in the case of the sedentary person, an accumulation is\r\nlikely to occur. This may become so considerable that obesity results.\r\nTissues in which normally but little fat is accumulated may become\r\ninfiltrated to a large extent. The intermuscular fibrous tissue thus\r\nbecomes loaded, and the activity, as well as the nutrition, of the\r\nmuscles is impaired. This accumulation may be manifested not only in\r\nthe voluntary muscles, but in the heart as well, which may present\r\nabundant sub-pericardial and sub-endocardial fat, the myocardium also\r\nbeing interlarded with streaks of fat, the so-called fatty\r\ninfiltration of the heart. The abdominal walls may become thickened to\r\nthe extent of a couple of inches, and the mesentery, omentum,\r\nperinephritic tissue, and liver may become enormously increased in\r\nweight from the mass of accumulated fat.\r\n\r\nThis infiltration of fat may take place under pathological as well as\r\nphysiological conditions. It is apparent that those causes which check\r\noxidation are likely also to prevent the consumption of fat, and it is\r\nwell known that the destructive processes in the lung, grouped under\r\nthe term pulmonary consumption, accomplish this result. Something\r\nmore, however, is necessary than the obliteration of pulmonary\r\nblood-vessels and the destruction of an aërating surface. There may\r\nbe, as in emphysema of the lung, a diminished respiratory and vascular\r\nsurface, yet evidences of fatty infiltration, particularly of the\r\nliver, are wanting. It seems probable that the constant anæmia, with\r\nthe loss of the blood-corpuscles, of pulmonary phthisis is an\r\nimportant additional factor in checking oxidation in this disease.\r\nThis factor, it is needless to say, is not a necessary occurrence in\r\npulmonary emphysema.\r\n\r\nLitten[31] has shown that when certain animals are exposed to high\r\ntemperatures the appearances of fatty infiltration and degeneration\r\nare present in various organs of the body. He attributes the fatty\r\ndegeneration to a direct poisoning of the red blood-corpuscles and a\r\nresulting diminution of the oxidizing processes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1877, lxx. 10.]\r\n\r\nIt is universally admitted that in chronic alcoholism a fatty liver is\r\nfrequently met with, even in the absence of those chronic interstitial\r\ntissue-changes usually characterized under the name cirrhosis. Alcohol\r\nis known to check the reception of oxygen and the elimination of\r\ncarbonic acid, and, whatever other disturbance of cell-activity it may\r\nproduce, its effect in favoring the accumulation of fat is directly\r\nattributable, in part at least, to this disturbance of oxidation.\r\n\r\nIn those conditions known as cachexiæ, the constant accompaniment of\r\nprogressive and wasting diseases, as cancer, leucæmia, chronic\r\ndysentery, {78} etc., a fatty infiltration, particularly of the liver,\r\nis a frequent accompaniment. A cachexia is dependent upon a complex\r\nseries of processes, many of which tend to check oxidation, and in\r\nthis respect is to be grouped with the conditions previously\r\nmentioned. That the associated fatty infiltration is intimately\r\nconnected with the deficient oxidation is not to be doubted, although\r\nthe agents producing this deficiency may vary in detail.\r\n\r\nThe causes which favor fatty degeneration are numerous, and the result\r\nrepresents one of the most serious conditions which can affect an\r\norgan. As oxidation represents the chief means of normally disposing\r\nof fat, so, pathologically, deficient oxidation favors the retention\r\nof fat due to degeneration. Were a constant renewal of protoplasm to\r\ntake place, the degenerated fat might be displaced into the\r\ncirculation or retained within the cell. If the latter event should\r\noccur, the result would be apparent as an infiltration, owing to the\r\nincreased size of the cell, although the condition giving rise to the\r\npresence of the fat is a degenerative process. The importance of\r\nimpairment of nutrition as the chief cause for fatty degeneration is\r\nthus obvious. It may readily be produced, experimentally, by measures\r\nwhich check the flow of blood to a part. The same measures necessarily\r\nprevent the presence of abundant oxygen, as fewer red blood-corpuscles\r\nare presented.\r\n\r\nFatty degeneration resulting from impaired nutrition is apparent in\r\nthe heart in consequence of stenosis of its coronary arteries, in the\r\nkidneys as a result of interstitial processes obstructing the\r\ncapillary circulation, in the brain from obliterative processes in the\r\narteries at the base or within the organ, and in blood-vessels from\r\nthe effect of age.\r\n\r\nThe cause of fatty degeneration may be general as well as local. In\r\npoisoning from phosphorus and arsenic the appearances in most of the\r\norgans indicate an actual destruction of protoplasm. Analysis of the\r\nsecretions confirms this inference, as the production of urea is\r\nlargely increased. Furthermore, there is less oxygen taken in and less\r\ncarbonic acid eliminated. As has been previously stated, these\r\nconditions may be present in the starving animal. The fatty\r\ndegeneration is thus easily explained as a metamorphosis of\r\ncell-protoplasm, and the deficient oxidation of the fat calls direct\r\nattention to its accumulation rather than elimination.\r\n\r\nIn acute yellow atrophy of the liver and in cases of severe jaundice\r\nfatty degenerations are constantly met with. That the origin and\r\naccumulation of fat in these affections is also due to rapid\r\ntissue-metamorphosis and checked oxidation is highly probable.\r\nAlthough the elimination of urea diminishes rather than increases, as\r\nshown by Schultzen and Riess, there are other links in the chain of\r\nretrograde changes, as the appearance of leucin and tyrosin,\r\nindicative of the extensive destruction of albuminates.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary in a work of the present character to call attention\r\nto all the possible circumstances under which fat is present in the\r\nbody as the result of degeneration. Mention may be made of the acute\r\nparenchymatous (fatty) degeneration of new-born children, of the\r\nresults of excessive bleeding, and of pernicious anæmia otherwise\r\noccasioned. The fatty degeneration of the uterus after parturition, of\r\nparalyzed muscles, and of tumors, the atrophic fatty degeneration of\r\nthe liver in chronic {79} passive congestion (nutmeg liver), are all\r\nwell-known examples. To these may be added the fatty degenerations\r\nassociated with amyloid and interstitial processes. It is apparent\r\nthat in most of these instances the common features of rapid\r\ntissue-metamorphosis and deficient oxidation are present, and, being\r\npresent, offer a ready explanation for the appearance of the fat.\r\n\r\nThe clinical importance of fatty metamorphosis requires consideration\r\nin connection with the description of the diseases in which its\r\noccurrence is a constant feature. As the presence of fat in cells is\r\nnot necessarily pathological, so an interference with the function of\r\nthe cell is not invariably implied by its presence. When its existence\r\nis suggestive of a local destruction of albuminates, a diminution of\r\ncell-activity is a necessary consequence. Such diminished activity\r\nmust produce different results as the cells are those of muscles, of\r\nvessels, or of glandular organs.\r\n\r\nEven if fat is found in cells under conditions favoring such a\r\nsuggestion, it does not follow that the destruction of the cell must\r\nresult. Not only is it possible that the fat may be reserved for\r\neventual oxidation, and its place in the protoplasm be filled by\r\nnormal constituents, but it is also possible that the fat may be\r\neliminated, as such, from the body. The latter event is made apparent\r\nby the experiments of numerous observers referred to by Cohnheim, who\r\nhave found free fat in the urine after its introduction into the\r\nvenous current.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cheesy Metamorphosis, Cheesy Degeneration, Caseation._\r\n\r\nVirchow introduced the term cheesy metamorphosis, tyrosis, to\r\ndesignate the process resulting in the incomplete absorption of pus\r\nand the production of apparently similar changes in certain other\r\noccasional constituents of the body. The characteristic cheesy\r\nappearances were regarded as due to the inspissation of the material\r\nconcerned, in consequence of the absorption of its fluid. With this\r\ninspissation there was frequently associated a partial fatty\r\ndegeneration, and the cheesy matter represented dead material, which\r\nmight undergo further changes, of which softening and calcification\r\nwere the more important.\r\n\r\nInflammatory products, as pus and fibrin, were especially prone to\r\nbecome thus transformed, as well as other relatively transitory\r\nmaterials of new formation--viz. tubercle and parts of various tumors.\r\nThe type of the cheesy metamorphosis was found in the enlarged\r\nlymphatic glands, commonly called scrofulous.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a clear understanding of the cheesy metamorphosis is\r\nnow a matter of history. It is merely necessary to allude to the fact\r\nthat these cheesy products were formerly regarded as indicative of the\r\npresence of tubercle, and were the tubercles. Tuberculization and the\r\ncheesy condition were synonymous terms, and their indiscriminate use\r\nled to much confusion with reference to the nature of tubercle.\r\n\r\nQuite recently Weigert[32] has called attention to the conditions\r\npresent in necrosis resulting from the intermediate stoppage of the\r\nblood-current in a part. The effect is manifested, under favoring\r\ncircumstances, by a cheesy appearance of the affected region, to which\r\nthe terms decolorized hemorrhagic infarction, anæmic or ischæmic\r\nnecrosis, have been applied. {80} Weigert lays stress upon the\r\nexistence of a coagulation of the protoplasm of the cells, with an\r\nearly disappearance of the nuclei, as the essential feature of this\r\nform of necrosis, the conditions present being regarded as analogous\r\nto those met with in the coagulation of the blood. The term\r\ncoagulative necrosis has consequently been introduced by Cohnheim to\r\nrepresent the process first fully described in detail by Weigert. The\r\noptical and physical properties of the ischæmic or coagulative\r\nnecroses of tissue are often manifested as cheesy appearances,\r\nalthough the term coagulative necrosis includes conditions which do\r\nnot present a suggestion of cheese. It is thus apparent that cheesy\r\nappearances may result in two ways: 1, by the inspissation of material\r\nin a state of partial fatty degeneration; 2, by a coagulation of the\r\nconstituents of cells whose blood-supply is suddenly and completely\r\ncut off. In the more restricted sense these caseous appearances are\r\nregarded as indicative of a cheesy metamorphosis which arises by the\r\nformer of these methods. Cheesy appearances, on the contrary,\r\ndependent upon the sudden death of a part, indicate an ischæmic or\r\ncoagulative necrosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1880, lxxix. 87.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the origin of the cheesy condition, the material\r\npresenting this appearance is liable to further changes, known as\r\nsoftening and calcification. The former event results from the soaking\r\nof the dead part with liquid, in consequence of which a detritus\r\nresults. The softening usually begins at the oldest part of the cheesy\r\nmass, and advances toward the periphery. The sanatory evacuation of\r\nthe emulsive detritus is permitted when a surface continuous with that\r\nof the external surface of the body is reached, as instanced by the\r\nescape of softened cheesy material from the lungs through a bronchus.\r\nThe possibility of the complete removal of the dead mass is thus at\r\nhand, and an eventual obliteration of the resulting cavity may take\r\nplace by an adhesive inflammation of its walls.\r\n\r\nThe complete absorption of the cheesy material of an ischæmic necrosis\r\nmay occur by the extension into the latter of a granulation-tissue\r\nfrom the periphery. Whenever cheesy appearances are found on surfaces,\r\nas the degenerated tubercles of mucous membranes or the circumscribed\r\nnecroses in diphtheritic inflammation or in typhoid fever, healing may\r\nbe accomplished by their detachment as sloughs, a clean ulcer being\r\nleft. Cheesy material is frequently encapsulated--_i.e._ imbedded in a\r\nlayer of dense connective tissue, a condition which indicates a local\r\ncessation of the process through which the cheesy appearances arose.\r\nThe same may be said of the infiltration of the cheesy mass with\r\nearthy salts--calcification--an event which will again be referred to\r\nin connection with the consideration of the general subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hyaline Degeneration, Fibrinous Degeneration, Croupous\r\nMetamorphosis._\r\n\r\nCertain of the conditions now regarded as indicative of a coagulative\r\nnecrosis or a hyaline degeneration were previously described by Wagner\r\nas the result of a croupous or fibrinous metamorphosis. According to\r\nthis observer, the cell-contents were transformed, under certain\r\ncircumstances, into a substance resembling externally clotted fibrin.\r\nThe formation of croupous and diphtheritic membranes, especially of\r\nthe larynx, pharynx, and trachea, was thus explained, also the hyaline\r\ncasts of the kidney.\r\n\r\n{81} The results of this metamorphosis presented a hyaline appearance\r\nunder the microscope, and the term hyaline degeneration is now applied\r\nmore especially to indicate the production of microscopic changes,\r\nwhile the hyaline appearances visible to the eye are rather included\r\nunder mucous, colloid, or amyloid metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nThe limitations in the use of the term hyaline degeneration are but\r\nill defined. On the one hand, there is included the transformation of\r\nmuscular tissue, first discovered by Zenker; on the other, the various\r\nchanges described by Recklinghausen and others, among which are\r\nembraced the results of Wagner's croupous metamorphosis. As the\r\nhyaline appearances are a frequent result of coagulative necrosis,\r\nthese terms are frequently used to indicate the same condition,\r\naccording as the optical or etiological features are uppermost in the\r\nmind of the observer.\r\n\r\nThe hyaline or waxy degeneration of muscular fibre described by Zenker\r\nrepresents a metamorphosis of the protoplasm of striated muscle in\r\nparticular, although the fusiform cells of the muscular coat of the\r\nstomach and intestine may present a similar transformation.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic appearances are more characteristic than those visible\r\nto the naked eye. To the latter the muscle appears paler, more\r\ntranslucent, and homogeneous, and proves to be more brittle than\r\nnormal. The muscular fibres are found with the microscope to be\r\nswollen, irregular in outline, the myosin transformed into flaky,\r\nglistening masses, without evidence of the normal transverse\r\nstriation. These appearances have given rise to the term waxy\r\ndegeneration, which suggests a possibility of confusion with the\r\nearlier recognized waxy degeneration of organs, due to the presence of\r\namyloid material. The waxy transformation of muscular fibre, however,\r\ndoes not present the reaction with iodine characteristic of amyloid\r\nsubstance. The degeneration of the muscle is usually regarded as the\r\nresult of a coagulation of the myosin, and it is claimed by Cohnheim\r\nthat the latter takes place only in dead muscle, either during the\r\nlife of the individual or as a post-mortem appearance.\r\n\r\nThe hyaline degeneration of muscular fibre is found in certain febrile\r\ndiseases, as typhoid and typhus fevers, scarlatina, variola, and\r\ncerebro-spinal meningitis. It may also be met with when a muscle has\r\nbeen exposed to violence, as in the insane who have been placed under\r\nmechanical restraint. It has further been found in the vicinity of\r\ntumors, especially where muscles have been invaded by their growth.\r\nCohnheim and Weil describe a similar condition in the tongue of frogs\r\nafter ligature of the lingual artery.\r\n\r\nThe pathological importance of the above-mentioned degeneration of\r\nmuscle is most prominent in cases of typhoid fever. The occurrence in\r\nthis disease of the hæmatoma or blood-tumor of the rectus abdominis is\r\nthus explained, the degenerated muscle and its contained blood-vessels\r\nbeing ruptured. The muscles of the thigh and the diaphragm frequently\r\nundergo this degeneration; the change is more rarely met with in other\r\nmuscles of the body.\r\n\r\nRecklinghausen regards a hyaline substance, hyalin, as a normal\r\nconstituent of cell-protoplasm which escapes in drops when the cell\r\ndies. Its presence indicates a diminution in the vitality of the cell\r\nfrom various causes. Under the microscope it appears as a sharply\r\ndefined, highly refractive meshwork, enclosing spaces of irregular\r\nshape and size, in {82} which are frequently found nuclei, more rarely\r\ncells or granules. Langhans has described this appearance as\r\nchannelled fibrin. It has been met with in the placenta, diphtheritic\r\nmembranes, blood-vessels, tubercles, and gummata.\r\n\r\nThe latest contribution to the history and nature of this form of\r\ndegeneration has been furnished by Vallat,[33] from whose article many\r\nof the above data have been obtained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1882, lxxxix. 193.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mucous Degeneration, Mucous Metamorphosis, Mucous Softening._\r\n\r\nOf the various degenerations presenting a colloid--_i.e._\r\ngelatinous--condition, the mucous variety is one of the most striking.\r\nIts gross appearances may not differ materially from those to be\r\ndescribed under the head of colloid degeneration, but the diagnostic\r\ncharacteristic of the change is to be found in the presence of mucin.\r\nThe presence of this substance is readily detected by the addition of\r\nacetic acid to mucus, the effect being a fibrillated appearance of the\r\nlatter, the fibres presenting a more or less parallel distribution.\r\nThis fibrillation of mucus is regarded as the result of a coagulation\r\nof its mucin, previously held in solution by an alkali. Mucin is thus\r\npresent in the body as a normal constituent, and, in the secretions\r\nfrom mucous membranes, owes its origin to the existence of epithelial\r\ncells, whether these represent gland-cells, as in the case of the\r\nmuciparous glands of the bronchial mucous membranes, or whether they\r\nare superficial cells, as those of the gastric and intestinal mucous\r\nmembranes.\r\n\r\nIn the origin of mucus as a secretion from glands Heidenhain[34]\r\nclaims that a destruction of gland-cells accompanies the continuance\r\nof the secretion. At the outset, however, the mucin escapes from the\r\ncells, the latter remaining relatively intact. With the persistence of\r\nthe secretion there results a destruction and a new formation of the\r\nmuciparous cells. In the pathological production of mucus from mucous\r\nmembranes, as in catarrh, there is no reason to doubt that the\r\npersistence of an irritation is the cause of abundant mucus, and that\r\nthe latter is dependent upon the rapid formation and destruction of\r\nepithelial cells.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Hermann's Handbuch der Physiologie_, 1880, v. 64.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of mucus from epithelial cells under physiological and\r\npathological conditions being apparent, it readily follows that the\r\nepithelioid cells of tumors might be supposed to be liable to a\r\nsimilar metamorphosis. It is well known that cancerous tumors,\r\nespecially those of the stomach and large intestine, are frequently\r\nmet with, which present an abundant gelatinous material, more or less\r\ncompletely filling the spongy, fibrous meshwork. These are the\r\nalveolar, gelatinous, or colloid cancers.\r\n\r\nThe gelatinous or colloid material often gives the reaction of mucin,\r\nand the microscopic appearances of the tumor show that the jelly-like\r\nsubstance lies in that part of the tumor which corresponds with the\r\nposition of the epithelioid cells. The latter are found in various\r\nstages of degeneration, the appearances being similar to those\r\nobserved in the mucous degeneration of true epithelium.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing theory of the origin of cancer from epithelial\r\nstructures {83} readily suggests an explanation for the frequency of\r\nthe mucous variety of cancer in connection with those parts from which\r\nmucus normally arises from the degeneration of the epithelium.\r\n\r\nThe mucous metamorphosis affects connective tissues as well as\r\nepithelium. The Whartonian jelly of the umbilical cord and the\r\nvitreous humor of the eye are known, through the investigations of\r\nVirchow, to owe their gelatinous condition to the presence of mucin.\r\nThe latter lies in the intercellular substance; that is, between the\r\ncells. The appearance of these indicates no degenerative process, but\r\nthe presence of mucin is obviously an essential constituent of the\r\ntissue. Whether this mucin represents a transformation of the gelatin\r\nof the intercellular substance, or a secretion from the fixed cells,\r\nor a metamorphosis of the migratory cells of the tissue, is not known.\r\nIn mucous tissue, however, there is present mucin, wholly independent\r\nof any epithelial degeneration. Mucous tissue is present in the eye as\r\na normal constituent of the adult, and in the umbilical cord as a\r\nnormal constituent of the infant at full term. It is also abundantly\r\nmet with in the subcutaneous and intermuscular tissues of the foetus.\r\nIts pathological occurrence in the adult as a circumscribed tumor, the\r\nmyxoma, may also be mentioned.\r\n\r\nA gelatinous substance containing mucin is found in the adult\r\nindependent of the mucous tissue, but obviously arising from a\r\ntransformation of intercellular substance. The most striking example\r\nof this occurrence is the cystoid softening of cartilage, especially\r\nof the costal cartilages of old people, the basis substance being\r\ntransformed into a fluid containing mucin. A similar metamorphosis is\r\nof frequent occurrence in the intervertebral disks and in the\r\ndestruction of cartilage in acute and chronic inflammations of the\r\njoints. The intercellular substance of cartilaginous tumors also\r\nbecomes softened and converted into a liquid containing mucin.\r\n\r\nIn osteomalacia and in the absorption of bone the mucous degeneration\r\nof the bone-cartilage plays an important part. The lime salts are\r\nfirst set free, and the cartilage then undergoes a mucous\r\ndegeneration; the product is either absorbed or remains as a liquid\r\nwithin cavities of large or small size. The mucous metamorphoses of\r\nfibrous and fat-tissues, likewise of bone-marrow, are well recognized\r\ninstances of the occurrence of a mucous transformation of the\r\nintercellular substance of connective tissues. Finally, clotted\r\nfibrin, so often met with as the product of the inflammation of serous\r\nsurfaces, may undergo a mucous metamorphosis, and, thus transformed,\r\noffer a suitable material for absorption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colloid Degeneration, Colloid Metamorphosis._\r\n\r\nLaennec used the term colloid in a descriptive sense to indicate a\r\ngelatinous appearance, and for a long time its use was thus\r\nrestricted. As the colloid appearances were found to differ in their\r\nchemical reaction, their distribution, and their pathological\r\nimportance, and as the term was further extended to include\r\nappearances seen with the microscope, it obviously became necessary to\r\nsubdivide the colloid series of changes according to the observed\r\ndifferences. Its use is now limited to those gelatinous conditions or\r\nappearances due to the presence of a fixed albuminate, homogeneous or\r\nfinely granular, translucent, colorless or pale {84} yellow, of\r\nvarying consistency, which does not become fibrillated on the addition\r\nof acetic acid, and which does not change in color when acted upon by\r\niodine. This albuminate is considered in most instances to represent\r\nthe result of a transformation, a metamorphosis of cells, and is\r\nassociated with an impairment of their function--a degeneration which\r\nis progressive, and leads, sometimes, to the destruction of the organ,\r\nas occurs in certain instances of colloid degeneration of the thyroid\r\nbody. Usually, the process is limited, affecting particular parts\r\nrather than the whole of an organ. The reaction presented by a\r\nsolution of sodium albuminate in the presence of neutral salts leads\r\nto the view that colloid material may represent a coagulation of an\r\nalbuminous substance or substances under favoring conditions. The\r\npresence of colloid masses in the kidney thus meets with a plausible\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe place of its typical occurrence is the thyroid body in certain\r\ncases of goitre, and it is early met with as a homogeneous substance\r\nreplacing the granular cell-protoplasm. With its increase the latter\r\ndisappears, and the entire cell is transformed into a homogeneous\r\nsphere. At times the colloid substance may be seen to project from the\r\nsurface of the cell as a pale rounded clump. The aggregation of these\r\nclumps results in the presence of masses of various size, in which may\r\nbe found granules of fat or pigment and crystals of cholesterin, which\r\nare accidental, not essential. Colloid masses are sometimes met\r\nwith--in lymphatic glands, for instance--as concretions, mulberry-like\r\naggregations of stratified colloid bodies, which may be infiltrated\r\nwith earthy salts. Colloid material may eventually become liquefied,\r\ntransformed into a sodium albuminate; and the presence of cysts in\r\ncertain varieties of goitre is thus explained. The coexistence in the\r\nkidney of colloid accumulations and watery cysts has led to the view\r\nthat the latter may, under certain circumstances, result from the\r\nformer through the liquefaction of the colloid material. The same view\r\nis held with regard to the origin of cysts frequently met with in the\r\nchoroid plexuses.\r\n\r\nThe colloid metamorphosis of cells is also to be found in the\r\nepithelium of mucous membranes and their glands, in the prostate,\r\nsuprarenal capsule, sebaceous glands of the skin, and in the cells of\r\ncertain tumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amyloid Degeneration, Amyloid Infiltration, Waxy Degeneration,\r\nLardaceous Degeneration._\r\n\r\nThe colloid appearances due to the amyloid degeneration of cells are\r\nof the greatest clinical importance from their frequent occurrence and\r\nthe gravity of the symptoms connected with their presence. In amyloid\r\ndegeneration there is the transformation of the cell-protoplasm into\r\nan albuminous material different from other albuminates found in the\r\nbody. This transformation is at the expense of the functional activity\r\nof the cell, and the latter becomes inert. Amyloid degeneration\r\nrepresents no mere substitution, but an addition, since the affected\r\ntissue is increased in volume. The albuminate was called amyloid by\r\nVirchow in consequence of its color-reaction with iodine. Its method\r\nof origin is wholly unknown, never being found in the circulating\r\nfluids nor in articles of food. It is met with chiefly in the cell,\r\nalthough its presence in the intercellular substance of old people is\r\nrecognized, and its occurrence in {85} the midst of the thrombotic\r\ndeposition on inflamed valves and in the results of inflammatory\r\nprocesses is also recorded.\r\n\r\nAt present the question is under discussion whether the amyloid\r\ndegeneration may affect cells of the most varied character, or whether\r\nit is limited to those of connective tissues. Eberth[35] maintains\r\nthat in all cases the amyloid disturbance is seated in the connective\r\ntissue. Kyber,[36] the latest investigator, in opposition to this view\r\nmaintains that this affection is not limited to the connective tissue,\r\nbut may also be seated in the parenchymatous cells of organs. Whether\r\nthe one of these views is to exclude the other, or whether both are\r\nnot correct, remains for future investigation to decide.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1880, lxxx. 138; 1881, lxxxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Ibid._, 1880, lxxxi. 7, 111.]\r\n\r\nWherever the amyloid material may be situated, the result is a\r\ntransformation of the cells into a homogeneous, glistening, colorless\r\nmaterial, which occupies more space than the original cell, and, when\r\nabundant, is accompanied with a loss of the primitive details of the\r\ncell-structure. This material is recognized by the color it presents\r\nwhen acted upon by iodine alone, by iodine and sulphuric acid, or by\r\nmethyl-aniline. The first produces a reddish-brown color, the second a\r\nblue, and the last a violet or purple color. These reactions are all\r\ncharacteristic, and the first is of special value in the macroscopic\r\nrecognition of the process, while the last two are of special\r\nimportance in the microscopic recognition of the earlier stages of the\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nWith the advance of the degeneration and its dissemination, the organ\r\naffected presents, in the diseased portions, pale-gray, glistening,\r\ntranslucent patches, and becomes increased in size and density in\r\nproportion to the quantity of amyloid material present. The change\r\nappears primarily in the vessel wall or outside the same, and there\r\nresults a diminution in the calibre of the vessels, with a lessened\r\nquantity of blood in the organ.\r\n\r\nFrom the homogeneous and translucent appearance of the surface and the\r\nincreased density of the tissues the resemblance to bacon or wax is\r\nsuggested, and the terms lardaceous, bacony, or waxy degeneration have\r\nbeen applied. Notable differences in degree and seat occur in\r\nconnection with the organs diseased. In the spleen, for example, the\r\nchange may be limited to the arteries of the Malpighian bodies and\r\ntheir immediate surroundings. To this condition the term sago spleen\r\nis applied, the enlarged, rounded, translucent, and projecting bodies\r\nsuggesting granules of boiled sago. The appearances of the diseased\r\npart are further affected by the association of other conditions, as\r\nthe presence of fat or pigment. When fat is present, it is often to be\r\nregarded as a result of the gradual and progressive increase in the\r\nobstruction to the circulation of blood in the organ.\r\n\r\nAlthough so little is known of the immediate cause of amyloid\r\ndegeneration, its distribution in the various organs of the body is\r\nfully ascertained, as well as certain of the conditions which are\r\nlikely to be followed by its presence. It is known to occur as a\r\nlocalized process in cartilage, in the conjunctiva, in certain tumors,\r\ncardiac thrombi, scars, retained inflammatory products, and renal\r\ncasts. The causes of this localized appearance are wholly obscure, and\r\nlittle or no general inconvenience results. Its presence, however, on\r\na large scale and in various parts of {86} the body at the same time,\r\nis met with under such circumstances as indicate a distinct\r\netiological relation. An appreciation of these circumstances is of\r\nimportance, since their existence demands an investigation as to the\r\nprobable presence of the degeneration. The organs thus affected are\r\nthe spleen, liver, kidneys, and intestine. It is to their disturbance\r\nof function that the pathological importance of amyloid degeneration\r\nis to be especially attributed.\r\n\r\nOther organs which may sometimes be affected are the lymphatic glands,\r\npancreas, suprarenal capsules, omentum, uterus, bladder, prostate\r\ngland, heart, and thyroid body. In the case of a general diffused\r\ninfiltration these organs are variously degenerated, now some, and\r\nagain others, showing a more extensive alteration, while few or many\r\nmay be simultaneously diseased. The longer the process has continued,\r\nthe greater the degree of the disturbance and the larger the number of\r\nthe organs infiltrated. Although, in general, a period of months and\r\nyears may be demanded for these extensive changes, very serious\r\ndisturbances may arise within a short time, and Cohnheim[37] records\r\nseveral cases which suggest that widely diffused amyloid degeneration\r\nmay occur within a few months--in one instance in less than four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1872, liv. 271.]\r\n\r\nAll that is at present known with regard to the etiology of this\r\nprocess applies to certain general diseases with which in the course\r\nof time it is likely to be associated. These have one element in\r\ncommon, that of chronicity, and are likewise the occasion of a\r\nprogressive wasting of the body. Of these affections, that which holds\r\nthe first place is chronic pulmonary consumption, especially that form\r\nin which extensive destruction of the lungs and ulcers of the\r\nintestine are present. Another disease whose effects are in like\r\nmanner to be regarded as general is syphilis, and in the later stages\r\nof this disease amyloid degeneration is likely to occur, and often to\r\nrepresent by its resulting disturbances the immediate cause of death.\r\nAgain, chronic suppurative processes, especially those due to disease\r\nof the bones and joints, are a frequent antecedent of amyloid\r\ndegeneration. Finally, the process has been found in connection with\r\nleucæmia, chronic intermittent fever, rickets, gout, and certain\r\nmalignant tumors. This last group, however, is one in whose sequence\r\nthe degeneration is to be regarded as exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe clinical importance of this process is due to the resulting\r\ndisturbances in the function of such important organs as the liver and\r\nintestines, the spleen and lymphatic glands, and the kidneys. The\r\nnature of these disturbances obviously demands detailed consideration\r\nin connection with the description of the diseases of the respective\r\norgans. It may be mentioned here that the infiltration of the walls\r\nleads to a narrowing of the calibre of blood-vessels, and thus a\r\ndiminution in the supply of blood to the part or organ. The resulting\r\nimpairment of nutrition becomes enhanced from the condition of the\r\nblood, which is impoverished from the simultaneous infiltration of the\r\nblood-making organs. The nutrition of the individual thus suffers as\r\nwell as that of the immediately diseased organ. Fatty degeneration and\r\natrophy of the parenchymatous cells of organs like the liver and\r\nkidneys is the constant result of long-continued and extensive\r\ninfiltration of these glands.\r\n\r\nMention is intentionally omitted of the so-called amyloid bodies, {87}\r\ncorpora amylacea, considered in connection with amyloid degeneration\r\nin most text-books on pathology and pathological anatomy. They usually\r\npresent a different reaction with iodine, their origin has but little\r\nin common, their distribution is for the most part unlike, and little\r\nor no clinical importance is to be attached to their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calcification, Ossification, Petrifaction._\r\n\r\nWhen salts previously held in solution are precipitated under abnormal\r\ncircumstances in the tissues of the body, the part is said to be\r\ncalcified, ossified, or petrified. Although these terms are often used\r\nas equivalent, the last is to be regarded as more general than its\r\npredecessors, since it includes the deposition of other than the\r\ncalcareous salts.\r\n\r\nIn the pathological ossification, as well as its physiological\r\nprototype, the carbonates and phosphates of calcium and magnesium are\r\npresent in a specially formed tissue of the nature of bone-cartilage,\r\nwhereas calcification occurs independently of such a new-formed\r\ntissue. The deposition of the calcareous salts takes place either in\r\nthe cells or intercellular substance of living or dead tissues, when\r\nthe terms calcification or ossification are applied, or as\r\naccumulations of various size in tissues or canals, which are known as\r\nconcretions and calculi.\r\n\r\nThe immediate causes of the physiological deposition in the formation\r\nof bone are so obscure that only more or less probable explanatory\r\ntheories are advanced, to all of which obvious objections arise. The\r\ncauses of a pathological precipitation may be regarded as equally\r\nhidden. It is apparent, however, that old age usually furnishes the\r\nnecessary factors. This in part may be due to the feeble nutrition\r\nassociated with impairment of function in advancing years. In part it\r\nmay be the result of the numerous opportunities offered in a long life\r\nfor the occurrence of inflammation, the products of which are\r\nfrequently infiltrated with calcareous salts. The latter are\r\napparently kept in solution by the action of living cells, for, though\r\npresented to all in the fluids of the body, they are precipitated most\r\nconstantly in dead parts or in the vicinity of those cells whose\r\nfunction is presumably lessened from disease or age. The solvent\r\naction of living cells is further demonstrated by the effect of the\r\ngiant-cells in removing calcium salts from living or dead bone.\r\n\r\nThe causes of calcification are therefore to be regarded as local,\r\ndepending upon a destruction or weakening of the cells of a\r\npart--conditions which are directly attributable to an interference\r\nwith nutrition. The deposition of calcium salts thus represents a\r\ndisorder of nutrition, and may be experimentally produced by agencies\r\nwhich occasion a necrosis of tissues.\r\n\r\nAlthough the immediate causes of the precipitation of the calcium\r\nsalts must be expressed somewhat vaguely, the places and effects of\r\ntheir accumulation are sufficiently well known, as are the resulting\r\nappearances. The presence of these salts in sufficient quantity\r\nproduces a homogeneous, granular, strongly refractive appearance of\r\nthe cell or intercellular substance, in addition to a greatly\r\nincreased resistance to pressure. When muriatic acid is added to the\r\naffected part, the salts are dissolved, with the escape of abundant\r\nbubbles of gas when a carbonate is present, and with a rapid fading of\r\nthe glistening appearance, without effervescence, {88} when the salt\r\nis a phosphate. After the removal, the cell or intercellular substance\r\nis readily recognized, with such modifications in its appearance as\r\nmay be due to the action of the strong acid. The parts in which this\r\ndeposition or infiltration has taken place are either relatively\r\nnormal in appearance or variously altered from disease, and the\r\ncalcium salts are to be regarded as absorbed from the constituents of\r\nthe food and deposited, or as taken up and transferred from the bones\r\nof the body. That both sources are drawn upon is obvious from the\r\nabnormal presence of calcareous material in the soft parts, in\r\nconnection with increased density of the bones, as well as with a\r\ndiminution in the density of the latter. The term calcification is\r\nmore correctly applied to the presence of the salts in normal tissues\r\nother than bone, or in the products of disease not simulating\r\nbone-cartilage in structure. A pathological ossification is to be\r\nconsidered present when an actual new formation of bone has taken\r\nplace so limited and so situated as not to suggest a tumor of bone, or\r\nwhen the calcium salts are deposited in a new-formed tissue whose\r\nstructure stimulates that of bone-cartilage.\r\n\r\nTissues which may become calcified are, in the first instance, the\r\nconnective tissues, and of these fibrous tissue and cartilage are\r\nespecially liable. Epithelial, muscle--in particular the unstriped\r\nvariety--and ganglion-cells may also become calcified. The frequency\r\nwith which blood-vessels, especially arteries, are affected is such\r\nthat it is regarded as almost normal in advancing years that\r\ncalcareous material should be deposited within the vascular walls. A\r\ndistinction is drawn between an ossification and a calcification of\r\nthe blood-vessels. The former term should be limited to the osteoid\r\nplates so often found as circumscribed thickenings of the aortic\r\nintima, and which are obviously new-formed patches of fibrous tissue\r\nin which the calcium salts are accumulated. A calcified artery, on the\r\ncontrary, is one usually of a size varying between that of the common\r\niliac and the temporal arteries, whose wall has become rigid and\r\nunyielding, suggestive of a pipe-stem, from the presence of calcareous\r\ndeposits in the muscular middle coat.\r\n\r\nFrom the frequency with which the osseous plates of the aorta are\r\nassociated with the fatty and fibrous changes in chronic inflammation\r\nof the intima, the so-called atheromatous degeneration of the same, it\r\nis customary to speak of the calcified artery at the wrist or temple\r\nas an atheromatous artery or as evincing an atheromatous degeneration.\r\nThe common feature in the aortic changes and in the calcified muscular\r\ncoat is the element of age. They are frequently, though not\r\nnecessarily, associated. The one is the result of an inflammatory\r\nprocess productive of a new, fibrous, tissue in which the calcium\r\nsalts are infiltrated; while the other is due to a deposition of the\r\nlatter in the normal, pre-existing, muscular elements of the vessel.\r\n\r\nCalcification and ossification of blood-vessels are frequent when the\r\nlatter become dilated, as in aneurisms, whether these occur as\r\ncircumscribed tumors or as a serpentine elongation and widening of the\r\naffected vessel.\r\n\r\nCartilage is also a tissue which presents a double relation to\r\ncalcareous deposition. On the one hand, there may exist an\r\nossification resulting from the extension of a growth of bone from the\r\nperichondrium into the cartilage. The structure of this bone presents\r\nall the details found in {89} normal bone--lacunæ, lamellæ, and\r\nmarrow-spaces. On the other hand, a section of the cartilage,\r\nespecially the costal cartilages, may contain opaque, gray, or\r\ngrayish-yellow patches, grating under the knife, which are wholly due\r\nto the presence of calcium salts in the hyaline intercellular\r\nsubstance of the cartilage. This calcification of the cartilage, which\r\nmay also involve the capsules of the cells, is frequently associated\r\nwith an ossification, although this relation is in no way essential.\r\n\r\nCalcification of the placenta, of the fibrous framework of the lungs,\r\nof the mucous membrane of the stomach, or of the atrophied glomeruli\r\nof the kidney, are well-recognized instances of the infiltration of\r\ncalcareous material in normal or atrophied tissues. On the contrary,\r\nossification of the fibrous inflammatory products of the pleura,\r\npericardium, and peritoneum are instances of a pathological\r\nbone-formation, analogous in its nature to that met with in the intima\r\nof the aorta. The fibrinous and fibrino-cellular products of the\r\ninflammation of serous surfaces are favorable positions for the\r\ndeposition of calcium salts, as are thrombi arising from the walls of\r\nblood-vessels. The latter are rather instances of the calcification of\r\ndead parts, analogous to the members of the group which includes the\r\nformation of calculi and concretions, the calcification of the dead\r\nfoetus in abdominal parturition, of cheesy lymphatic glands, and of\r\ncheesy material in the lungs and elsewhere. Finally, there remains the\r\ncalcification of tumors of the most varied nature, the salts being\r\npresent either in living or dead parts of the tumor.\r\n\r\nInstances of the deposition in the tissues of other than calcareous\r\nsalts are abundantly met with in gout. In this disease cartilage,\r\nligaments, and tendons, bone-marrow, muscle, the endocardium and\r\naorta, the membranes of the brain and spinal cord, the skin and\r\nkidneys, may contain deposits of acicular crystals and amorphous\r\ngranules. Although these deposits are largely composed of sodium\r\nurate, calcium urate may be present with other salts, as sodium\r\nchloride and calcareous compounds. According to Ebstein,[38] the\r\nearthy salts in gout are deposited in necrotic patches of previously\r\ndiseased tissue. The local conditions are therefore analogous to those\r\nconcerned in the formation of chalky concretions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Die Natur und Behandlung der Gicht_, Wiesbaden, 1882,\r\n45.]\r\n\r\nConcretions and calculi are collections of earthy salts, the former\r\nlying within tissues, the latter being present in canals opening\r\nexternally. Both represent the results of a deposition in and upon\r\norganic material, which is often an inflammatory product, at times\r\nsurrounding a foreign body acting as the exciting cause of the\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nThe earthy matter of which the concretion is composed consists mainly\r\nof carbonate and phosphate of calcium, while the chemical properties\r\nof the calculi often vary in accordance with the nature of the\r\nsecretion which flows by them. The salivary, pancreatic, intestinal,\r\nlachrymal, and prostatic calculi are chiefly formed of calcareous\r\nsalts. These salts also are an important, if not the chief,\r\nconstituent of biliary and urinary calculi. In the former pigment,\r\nbile acids, and cholesterin may also be present. Urinary calculi are\r\nof still more varied composition, containing not only the calcium\r\nsalts, as the oxalate, phosphate, and carbonate, but also uric acid\r\nand the urates of sodium and ammonium, in addition to the\r\nammoniaco-magnesian phosphate.\r\n\r\nThe infiltration with calcium salts may prove beneficial as well as\r\n{90} injurious--beneficial under those circumstances where further\r\nchanges might prove harmful, as in the softening of cheesy material or\r\nthe maceration of a dead foetus in the abdominal cavity. The\r\ncalcification of certain tumors, as the fibro-myoma of the uterus, is\r\nequally sanatory, the further growth of the calcified parts being thus\r\nchecked. The calcification of an aneurismal sac may prove beneficial\r\nin strengthening a weakened blood-vessel.\r\n\r\nThe injurious effects are seen more particularly in case of the\r\ncalcareous infiltration of the middle coat of arteries. Such vessels\r\nbecome converted into rigid and unyielding tubes at various parts of\r\ntheir course, and the nutrition of peripheral parts becomes\r\ncorrespondingly lessened. Hence, in great measure, the liability of\r\nold people to serious inflammatory processes from trivial irritation\r\nof peripheral portions of the body, such inflammations often\r\nterminating in gangrene.\r\n\r\nThe calcification and ossification of the cardiac valves and the\r\ncalcification of attached thrombi, furnish frequent and constant\r\noccasion for disturbances in the functions of the heart, resulting in\r\ndilatation and hypertrophy, with the sequence of symptoms of chronic\r\nvalvular endocarditis.\r\n\r\nThe great clinical importance of the presence of calcium salts in the\r\ncirculatory apparatus is such that further reference in this place to\r\nits results is unnecessary, as its special relations are more\r\nimportant than its general features.\r\n\r\nCalculi act as local causes of inflammation, and their presence is\r\nlikely to be followed by ulceration, abscess, and stenosis, perhaps\r\nobliteration, of the smaller canals in which they may lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pigmentation._\r\n\r\nThe pathological pigmentation of the body results, presumably, from\r\nthe metamorphosis of the coloring matter of the blood or from the\r\nintroduction from without of pigments insoluble in the fluids of the\r\nbody. The former of these methods has recently been studied by\r\nLanghans[39] and Cordua,[40] and the present views of this subject are\r\nchiefly due to their observations, as well as to the earlier\r\ninvestigations of Virchow and others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1870, xlix. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Ueber Resorptionsmechanismus von Blutergüssen_, Berlin,\r\n1877.]\r\n\r\nThe hæmoglobin contained in red blood-corpuscles is considered to be\r\ncomposed of a coloring matter, hæmatin, combined with an albuminate,\r\nglobulin. When blood is removed from the body the hæmoglobin is\r\nreadily separated from the corpuscles by various agents, and is then\r\ndissolved in the plasma, which becomes lac-colored. This solubility of\r\nthe hæmoglobin is of importance in connection with the absorption of\r\nextravasated blood. During the time necessary for this process to take\r\nplace, observable changes are apparent in the color of the affected\r\npart when its seat is superficial, especially cutaneous. These changes\r\nin color are largely dependent upon the modifications undergone by the\r\nhæmoglobin.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a yellowish discoloration of the general surface\r\nfrequently takes place when extensive internal hemorrhages have\r\noccurred, constituting a form of jaundice (hæmatogenous) attributed to\r\nthe presence of the coloring matter of the blood. As yet there has\r\nbeen no satisfactory chemical analysis of this diffused pigment, which\r\nif not hæmatin must be regarded as its derivative, although a\r\ncoexistent increase of the urobilin in the urine has been observed.\r\nThe association of the stained skin and urine, {91} in the absence of\r\ncauses favoring an absorption of bile-pigment, leads to the inference\r\nthat the abnormal discoloration is due to the absorption into the\r\ncirculating fluids of the body of a pigment dissolved out of the\r\nextravasated red blood-corpuscles. This view is confirmed by the\r\nmicroscopic examination of the latter, which discloses the presence of\r\npale, shadowy, round outlines enclosing faintly granular material,\r\nwhich are regarded as decolorized red corpuscles. In the course of a\r\nfew days glistening crystals and granules of a yellowish-red color\r\nmake their appearance in the midst of the unabsorbed blood. The\r\ncrystals are usually oblique rhombic prisms, varying in size from the\r\nlarger symmetrical shapes to the more minute, apparently granular,\r\nforms. Acicular crystals are also to be met with, more yellow than red\r\nin color, and are sometimes present in great abundance, although they\r\nmay be wholly absent. Virchow has applied the term hæmatoidin to these\r\ncrystals. Owing to the resemblance in the chemical reactions of\r\nsolutions of hæmatoidin and of the biliary coloring matter, bilirubin,\r\nand to the similar crystalline forms of the latter, it has been\r\nmaintained that the two are identical. Late investigations indicate\r\nthat solutions of crystals with the appearances of hæmatoidin are not\r\ninvariably alike in their reaction. A solution of these in chloroform\r\nmay become decolorized when acted upon by a dilute alkali, or it may\r\nnot be thus altered. Bilirubin presents the former relation, while\r\nchloroform solutions of the coloring matter of the yelk of egg and of\r\nthe corpus luteum, called lutein or hæmolutein, are not decolorized by\r\nan alkali. Although the crystalline forms of hæmatoidin and bilirubin\r\nare not to be distinguished, it is not to be conceded that the two\r\nsubstances are identical. As Maly,[41] the latest writer on this\r\nsubject, states, the term hæmatoidin is merely indicative of a\r\nmicroscopical picture. Although the identity of the coloring matter of\r\nthe blood and of the bile is not admitted, the intimate relation of\r\nthe two is not only suggested by the similarity of crystalline form,\r\nbut by the relation determined between urobilin, bilirubin, and\r\nhæmoglobin. Urobilin is the coloring matter extracted from the urine\r\nin fever by Jaffé, and it has since been obtained from bilirubin by\r\nMaly,[42] who has given it the name of hydrobilirubin. This\r\nhydrobilirubin has also been derived from hæmoglobin. According to\r\nMaly, this genetic relation between the coloring matter of the blood\r\nand bile, shown in the production of hydrobilirubin, is the only\r\nchemical evidence of the connection of the two pigments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Hermann's Handbuch der Physiologie_, 1880, vii. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Op. cit._, 161.]\r\n\r\nHæmatoidin is to be regarded not only as directly derived from\r\nsolutions of hæmoglobin, but as originating through the medium of\r\nindifferent cells. Langhans claims that this pigment is formed within\r\nmovable cells which accumulate in great numbers in the vicinity of the\r\nblood-clot, and, in virtue of their amoeboid properties, take into\r\nthemselves the extravasated corpuscles, entire or in fragments. The\r\nindifferent cell may become enlarged into a giant-cell, and then\r\ncontain numbers of whole or disintegrated red corpuscles. In time\r\nthese colored corpuscles and fragments become smaller, more\r\nglistening, and darker-colored, and eventually are transformed into\r\ngranular or crystalline hæmatoidin. These granules may be set free by\r\nthe fatty degeneration of the cell, or may be transferred within the\r\ncell to distant parts.\r\n\r\n{92} The diffusion and absorption of a solution of hæmoglobin, and the\r\nformation of crystals of hæmatoidin from the same or through the\r\nmedium of cells, are supplemented by an apparent inspissation and\r\ncondensation of the hæmoglobin. The resulting dark-brown pigment may\r\nremain at the seat of the hemorrhage indefinitely, and may be\r\naccompanied with reddish-brown flakes, which, as shown by Kunkel,[43]\r\nare composed of hydrated ferric oxide.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1880, lxxxi. 381.]\r\n\r\nAnother feature in the absorption of extravasated blood is to be found\r\non examination of the nearest chain of lymphatic glands. These may be\r\nseen swollen, of a dark-red color, and homogeneous surface. In density\r\nand color, as well as shape, they suggest the small supplementary\r\nspleens so frequently met with. These glands owe their change in\r\nappearance to the presence of large numbers of unaltered red\r\nblood-corpuscles which have entered the lymphatics traversing the\r\nregion of hemorrhage. Within the lymph-glands they undergo a\r\nmetamorphosis similar to that taking place at the part from which they\r\nwere transferred. In the course of weeks or months there remains in\r\nthe place of extravasation simply pigment, either as crystals or\r\ngranules. Such pigment may remain for years imbedded within the\r\ntissues, or it may become absorbed, no trace of the original\r\ndisturbance remaining. Its removal may take place presumably through a\r\nlocal solution of the pigment or the transfer of the granules or\r\ncrystals by means of wandering cells to the nearest lymphatic glands\r\nor to the more remote parts of the body. An eventual elimination may\r\noccur through the secretions, especially the urine or bile, or there\r\nmay result a deposition and permanent retention of the granules.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Langhans are especially interesting, as\r\nsuggesting efficient means for the production of pigment by cells\r\nwhose function is intimately connected with pigmentation, as the cells\r\nof the rete Malpighii, of the choroid, and of certain tumors. The\r\nobservations of Gussenbauer,[44] however, lead to the conclusion\r\nearlier advanced by Virchow, that pigment may be produced by the\r\ndiffusion into cells, outside the vessels, of a solution of the\r\npigment of the blood in the plasma of the latter. A precipitation of\r\nthis dissolved pigment into granules is considered as eventually\r\ntaking place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Ibid._, 1875, lxiii. 322.]\r\n\r\nThe method of origin of pigment thus described applies only to those\r\ndiscolorations which are unquestionably due to the metamorphosis of\r\nthe coloring matter of the blood. Examples are furnished not only by\r\nthe extravasation of blood on a large scale, but also by the escape of\r\nred blood-corpuscles in small numbers. Such an escape takes place from\r\nthe pulmonary vessels in chronic obstruction to the admission of blood\r\ninto the left side of the heart. The resulting brown induration of the\r\nlungs owes its color to the metamorphosed blood-pigment which is\r\npresent as hæmatoidin in the interstitial tissue of the lungs, as well\r\nas contained within amoeboid cells in the alveolar and bronchial\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that a similar transformation of hæmoglobin takes place\r\nin the spleen and elsewhere in melanæmia. In this condition the black\r\ngranules of pigment, although differing in color and form from\r\nhæmatoidin, contain iron, and have received the name melanin. These\r\ngranules are either free in the blood or are contained within the\r\nwhite {93} blood-corpuscles. Their origin in the spleen is directly\r\nsuggested by their frequent presence, often in considerable numbers,\r\nin the large, so-called splenic, corpuscles of the blood in the\r\nhepatic capillaries. Eventually, the pigment is found at more remote\r\npoints in the circulation, and becomes fixed in the interstitial\r\ntissue of the various organs of the body.\r\n\r\nThe black pigment of the cells of melanotic tumors, also called\r\nmelanin, is not to be directly traced to the hæmoglobin. Virchow[45]\r\nearly called attention to the absence of iron in such pigment.\r\nFerrated and non-ferrated varieties of melanin are thus to be\r\nrecognized, the term being used in the same way as hæmatoidin,\r\nindicative of a microscopical appearance. A still further complication\r\nin the composition of melanin is suggested by Kunkel,[46] who has\r\nisolated a ferrated pigment from melanotic tumors. It shows, however,\r\nwith the spectroscope, no relation to hæmatin, bilirubin, or\r\nhydrobilirubin. That its nature is similar to the normal pigment of\r\nthe skin and choroid is suggested by the customary origin of the\r\nmelanotic tumors in such pigmented tissues, and by the resemblance in\r\nappearance and reactions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1847, i. 378.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Ziegler, _op. cit._, 100.]\r\n\r\nThat pigment of the most varied sort may be introduced into the body\r\nfrom without, and may remain indefinitely in the organism, is\r\nsufficiently well known from the results of tattooing. What is\r\nessential in such cases is, that the pigment shall be finely divided\r\nand insoluble in the fluids of the body. The most important of such\r\npigmentations are those taking place through inhalation into the\r\nlungs. The reception by this channel of particles of soot is so common\r\nthat it is most exceptional for the lungs of an adult to be free from\r\nthe bluish-black discoloration due to this agent. Particles of\r\ncoal-dust presenting the details of vegetable structure are met with\r\nin the lungs of individuals exposed to an atmosphere charged with this\r\nmaterial. The worker compelled to inhale the dust of iron eventually\r\naccumulates a store of this substance, the quantity of which is\r\nessentially dependent upon the length of exposure, the degree of\r\nimpregnation of the atmosphere, and the insufficient nature of the\r\nprotectives employed.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large part of the pigmentation under such circumstances is\r\ndue to the direct presence of the foreign body, the appearances are\r\nalso partly the result of consequent minute hemorrhages. The coal-dust\r\nand the iron-filings are often sharp and jagged fragments, which\r\npenetrate the delicate tissues, and the escaping red blood-corpuscles\r\nare acted upon by the amoeboid cells in the air-passages, with the\r\nconsequent formation of hæmatin or hæmatoidin, as are the\r\nblood-corpuscles in larger hemorrhages. The inhaled pigment finds its\r\nway, either directly or by the agency of amoeboid cells, into the\r\nlymphatics and fibrous tissue of the lungs, and remains indefinitely\r\neither in the bronchial and pulmonary lymphatic glands or in the\r\ninterstitial tissue of the lungs.\r\n\r\nAttention may be here called to that pigmentation of the skin and\r\ndeeper-seated parts of the body, especially of the kidneys, known by\r\nthe term argyria. The long continued internal use of nitrate of\r\nsilver, in former years so extensively employed, especially in\r\ndiseases of the nervous system, results in the reduction of the silver\r\nand its deposition as minute particles in the tissues. Whether the\r\nsilver is first reduced in the {94} intestine and then absorbed, or\r\nwhether it is absorbed as an albuminate and subsequently reduced,\r\nstill remains an open question.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pathological pigmentations form an extended series of\r\nalterations, the clinical importance of the condition may be regarded\r\nin many instances as trivial. The pigments resulting from\r\nextravasation produce no disturbance of function. The presence of\r\nbile-pigment does not account for the symptoms of jaundice. The\r\nclinical importance of melanæmia has perhaps been overrated. The\r\nearlier observations led directly to the inference that mechanical\r\nobstruction to the circulation in various organs might take place. The\r\nparticles of pigment and the cells containing them were so numerous\r\nthat this inference seemed quite probable. The evidence is still\r\nlacking, however, which proves the existence of definite symptoms and\r\ncharacteristic lesions as the result of the melanæmic condition.\r\n\r\nThe inhaled foreign bodies, as coal and iron, are productive of\r\ngreater disturbances, and are well known as efficient causes in the\r\nproduction of chronic pulmonary consumption. The coal-miner's and\r\nscissors-grinder's phthises usually have, as an anatomical basis,\r\ncatarrhal conditions of the aërating surfaces and interstitial\r\ninflammations of the pulmonary connective tissue. Mechanical\r\nobstruction to the aëration of the blood may also be present from the\r\nextreme quantity of the foreign material in the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuberculosis.\r\n\r\nUntil the investigations and discoveries of the past few years, the\r\npresence of tubercles in the various organs and tissues of the body\r\nhad been regarded as the essential element of tuberculosis. The\r\nevidence to be presented in the following pages will show that the\r\nimmediate cause of tubercles may produce other lesions as well, and\r\nthat the presence of a specific virus as the efficient cause of\r\nwhatever may be the lesion, rather than the existence of tubercles, is\r\nto be regarded as the characteristic feature of the disease\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the present is to regard the latter term as including\r\nthe various morbid processes connected with the origin, presence, and\r\ngrowth of a specific, organized virus, their dissemination,\r\nmetamorphoses, and effects. Whether all those processes in connection\r\nwith which the virus is found are due to the latter, or whether some\r\nmay not arise and exist independently of the same, are among the\r\nquestions whose answer is remote rather than at hand.\r\n\r\nAs the presence of the cause of tuberculosis is the test demanded by\r\nsome authorities for the existence of the process, so the anatomical\r\nclassification has depended upon the existence of the tubercle. The\r\nsubstitution of tubercle for organized virus in the general definition\r\nof tuberculosis represents the distinction between the anatomical and\r\nthe etiological classification of this affection.\r\n\r\nA tubercle was originally a small rounded body, a little tuberosity,\r\nand at the close of the last century the specific tubercle was\r\ndistinguished from other rounded nodules.\r\n\r\nTill the discovery of Villemin, the recognition of the tubercle was\r\n{95} essentially based upon its anatomical characteristics. Previous\r\nto the studies of Reinhardt and Virchow these related to appearances,\r\nwhich were attributed to a deposition of material, scrofulous or\r\ntuberculous, from the blood or lymph. The idea was eventually\r\nmaintained that this material formed the basis of a growth or new\r\nformation, and Virchow showed that the tubercle was composed of a\r\ntissue, of cells and intercellular substance, growing within and from\r\npre-existing tissues. He classified the tubercles among the tumors as\r\ncircumscribed new formations whose structure resembled that of\r\ngranulation-tissue. The specific tubercle was, at the outset, minute,\r\nsmaller than a millet-seed, submiliary, although indefinite numbers of\r\nthese minute tubercles might be grouped together and form closely\r\nmassed aggregations. From this agglomeration of single tubercles, and\r\ntheir frequent association with inflammatory products, both of which\r\nwere prone to early death and transformation into a cheese-like mass,\r\nthe extensive tubercular infiltrations of organs arose. The latter\r\nwere regarded as a frequent cause of the wasting disease phthisis,\r\nwhich was either pulmonary, intestinal, or renal according as the\r\nlungs, intestine and mesenteric glands, or kidneys were the\r\npredominant seat of the tubercular growth.\r\n\r\nThe histological features of the tubercle were further investigated by\r\nWagner,[47] who described the resemblances and differences of the\r\nstructure of the tubercle and the lymphatic gland. Schüppel[48] soon\r\nafter published his monograph, essentially confirming the statements\r\nof Wagner. According to these observers, the typical tubercle, as\r\nfound in lymphatic glands, presents essentially the same peculiarities\r\nof structure when seen elsewhere in the body. This structure consists\r\nof a non-vascularized network of fibres, in the meshes of which cells\r\nare imbedded. The fibrous network resembles the reticulum of a\r\nlymphatic gland, and nuclei are often found at those points where the\r\nfibres are united. This appearance has suggested that the network is\r\nformed of branching and anastomosing cells. Within the meshes are\r\nthree sorts of cells--viz. giant-cells, epithelioid (endothelioid)\r\ncells, and small, round, indifferent cells. One or several\r\ngiant-cells, each with its abundant nuclei, lie near the centre of the\r\ntubercle or are diffused throughout the same. These are usually\r\nimmediately surrounded by the large epithelioid cells, with one or\r\nmore nuclei, which are often so numerous as to compose the greater\r\npart of the tubercle. The indifferent cells, resembling\r\nlymph-corpuscles, occur singly or in groups, distributed throughout\r\nthe tubercle more abundantly at the periphery, between the cells\r\npreviously described, and with them completely fill the spaces of the\r\nfibrous network.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: \"Das tuberkelähnliche Lymphadenom,\" _Archiv der\r\nHeilkunde_, 1870, xi. 6; xii. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Untersuchungen über Lymphdrüsen-Tuberkulose_, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the typical tubercle is thus constituted, the structural\r\nfeatures depend somewhat upon its age. It is generally admitted that\r\nthe freshest tubercles, as found in the external coat of the smaller\r\narteries of the pia mater, are composed of little else than a\r\ncircumscribed accumulation of small, round cells, without a distinct\r\nreticulum. The giant-cells, the epithelioid cells, and the\r\nwell-characterized reticulum appear as the tubercle increases in age.\r\nIt is thought probable that the giant-cells represent the\r\nagglomeration of the small, round cells in pre-existing cavities,\r\nlymphatics, blood-vessels, or secretory canals. The epithelioid cells\r\nin like {96} manner are considered to result from the enlargement or\r\nfusion of the smaller cells, while the reticulum represents either a\r\nsecretion from, or a transformation of, the cellular elements of which\r\nthe tubercle is composed.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the tubercle is dependent upon its\r\nmetamorphoses. These are known as cheesy degeneration, calcification,\r\nand fibrous transformation.\r\n\r\nThe absence of blood-vessels, already stated, and the abundantly\r\ncellular nature of the growth, with the possible action of\r\nmicro-organisms, result in a tendency to the early death of the cells\r\nand a necrosis of the tubercle. This is the cheesy degeneration, and\r\nis regarded as a form of coagulative necrosis, which begins at the\r\ncentre, advances toward the periphery, and results in the\r\ntransformation of the gray into a yellow tubercle. This termination in\r\ncheesy degeneration likewise affects inflammatory products surrounding\r\nthe tubercle, and even relatively normal tissues in which numerous\r\ntubercles may lie. This cheesy material either softens or becomes\r\ninfiltrated with lime salts, calcified. The softening of the tubercle\r\nresults in the formation of a material capable of removal as a\r\ndischarge from the surfaces of the body or by absorption through the\r\nlymphatics and blood-vessels. In the former event ulcers arise upon,\r\nand cavities communicate with, the surfaces of the body opening\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\nThe cheesy material frequently becomes calcified, thus remaining as a\r\ncomparatively inert mass. The earthy salts may be diffused throughout\r\na uniformly cheesy basis, or they may be deposited in a partially\r\nsoftened, cheesy menstruum, when a mortar-like material results.\r\n\r\nThe tubercle becomes fibrous with the diminution in the number of its\r\ncells and the increase in the thickness of the reticulum, with the\r\ntransformation of the latter into a homogeneous hyaline substance. The\r\ncornified, horn-like tubercle is one whose size is diminished from the\r\nshrinkage of its cells into glistening flakes, without an evident\r\nassociated cheesy or fatty degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation of scrofula to tuberculosis has been variously\r\nexpressed from time to time in accordance with the amount and accuracy\r\nof the existing knowledge. At the outset the enlargement of the\r\nlymphatic glands, especially of the neck, characterized the scrofulous\r\naffection. As the enlargements of the glands were found to present\r\nintrinsic differences connected with differing clinical histories,\r\nonly those glands were regarded as scrofulous which presented the\r\ncheesy appearances. With the recognition of the cheesy condition of\r\ntubercles the latter were identified with the scrofulous gland, from\r\nthe cheesy condition common to both.\r\n\r\nThis identification of scrofula and tubercle prevailed till Virchow\r\nshowed that cheesy material might have a different origin, and\r\nmaintained that there were cheesy lymphatic glands without tubercle,\r\nas well as tuberculous lymphatic glands which might become cheesy. A\r\ndistinction was thus drawn between scrofula and tuberculosis. The\r\nformer term was applied to that condition of the individual which\r\nfavored the retention and cheesy degeneration of inflammatory\r\nproducts, not only in the lymphatic glands, but elsewhere in the body.\r\nTuberculosis, on the contrary, was characterized by the production of\r\ntubercles which were often accompanied by retained inflammatory\r\nproducts, both of which were prone to undergo cheesy degeneration.\r\n\r\n{97} The frequent association of well-defined tubercles with what were\r\nregarded as antecedent scrofulous disturbances also suggested an\r\nintimacy of relation between scrofula and tuberculosis. Virchow[49]\r\nhad always maintained the possibility of regarding tuberculosis as a\r\nheteroplastic or metastatic scrofula. The occurrence of cases of\r\ntuberculosis without evidence of an antecedent scrofula prevented him\r\nfrom making a more absolute statement of the above relation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Die Krankhaften Geschwülste_, 1864-65, ii. 629.]\r\n\r\nThe views with regard to the connection between scrofula and\r\ntuberculosis have become essentially modified of late years as a\r\nresult of the investigations concerning the etiology of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Buhl[50] first published his view, although he had for\r\nseveral years been impressed with the idea, that miliary tuberculosis\r\nwas an infective disease resulting from the absorption of a specific\r\nvirus. He based his theory upon the almost constant coexistence of one\r\nor several cheesy collections and miliary tubercles. The former were\r\nrecognized as the remains of previous inflammatory processes, and the\r\ntubercles were looked upon as the immediate result of the absorption\r\nof this cheesy material. The individual thus infected himself.\r\nBuhl[51] claimed that the simultaneous occurrence of tubercles and\r\ninflammatory products was the co-effect of the same cause, and that\r\nthe acute miliary tuberculosis, as a localized process, was merely an\r\ninflammation with the development of tubercles. He restricted the term\r\ntuberculous inflammation, however, to those forms which necessarily\r\nand from the beginning, produced tubercles whose presence was limited\r\nto the tissue inflamed. The tuberculous inflammation was regarded as a\r\nprimary condition, while the acute miliary tuberculosis was a\r\nsecondary process resulting from infection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Lungenentzündung, Tuberkulose und Schwindsucht_, 1872,\r\niii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Op. cit._, 123.]\r\n\r\nThe tuberculous inflammation of this author was largely characterized\r\nby those features which, with the exception of the constant presence\r\nof tubercles, were recognized by others as attributes of a scrofulous\r\ninflammation. At the same time, he objected to the latter term as a\r\nsubstitute, since its use would imply that no other cheesy product\r\nthan that from a tuberculous inflammation would serve as the origin of\r\ntubercles. Buhl strictly maintained that the absorption of any cheesy\r\nmaterial, whatsoever its source, might give rise to a general growth\r\nof tubercle in the body.\r\n\r\nThe views of this author were popularized mainly through the teachings\r\nof Niemeyer[52] concerning pulmonary consumption. The latter adhered\r\nto Virchow's views relating to scrofulous inflammation, but maintained\r\nthat most consumptives were in imminent danger of becoming tuberculous\r\nin accordance with the doctrines of Buhl.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Klinische Vorträge über die Lungenschwindsucht_, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of an infectious origin of tuberculosis, advanced from time\r\nto time by others, but most forcibly presented and maintained by Buhl,\r\nwas first demonstrated by Villemin[53] in 1865. This observer showed\r\nthat certain animals, especially rabbits and guinea-pigs, might be\r\nsuccessfully inoculated, beneath the skin, with fragments of gray\r\ntubercle, cheesy products, sputum, and blood from cases of phthisis.\r\nThe development of tubercles took place within three weeks after the\r\n{98} inoculation, and became general within four weeks. He also\r\ndemonstrated that rabbits became tuberculous when inoculated with bits\r\nof the tumors occurring in the pearly distemper of cattle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Etudes sur la Tuberculose_, Paris, 1868, 528.]\r\n\r\nVillemin's observations have been repeatedly confirmed and extended;\r\nalthough subjected to the severest criticism and control, their\r\nresults are so constant that the law of the inoculability of tubercle\r\nis almost universally regarded as fixed. Its value as a test is\r\nevident from the statement of Cohnheim,[54] who regards as tuberculous\r\nonly that which produces tuberculosis when transferred to suitable\r\nanimals. The transfer may be made in various ways. Chauveau and others\r\nwere successful in producing an intestinal tuberculosis by the\r\nintroduction of tuberculous material into the intestinal canal of\r\nanimals, especially the Herbivora. Tappeiner[55] succeeded in\r\nproducing pulmonary tuberculosis, with or without general\r\ntuberculosis, in dogs, by compelling them to breathe air in which were\r\ncontained minute particles of sputa from tuberculous pulmonary\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Die Tuberkulose vom Standpunkte der Infections-Lehre_,\r\n1880, 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1878, lxxiv. 393.]\r\n\r\nThe production of a tuberculosis of the iris, as well as of remote\r\norgans, by the inoculation of tuberculous material into the anterior\r\nchamber of the eye, was an ingenious method devised by Cohnheim and\r\nSalomonsen.[56] It permitted the direct observation of the several\r\nsteps in the process of absorption of the inoculated material and\r\ndevelopment of the tubercles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Cohnheim's _Vorlesungen über Allgemeine Pathologie_, 2te\r\nAuflage, 1882, i. 707.]\r\n\r\nThe objections to the various experiments above alluded to are based\r\nupon the assumption that the results of the inoculation are not\r\ntubercles, but inflammatory products resembling tubercles. It is\r\nfurther advocated that the inoculation of indifferent material, as\r\nbits of glass or hairs, as well as other foreign substances, will\r\nproduce the so-called artificial tuberculosis, especially in rabbits\r\nand guinea-pigs. It is admitted that these animals readily become\r\ntuberculous when exposed to simple inflammatory irritants, the local\r\naction of which frequently results in the production of cheesy\r\nmaterial. This termination is now regarded as due to faults in the\r\nmethod of experimentation, the animals not being thoroughly protected\r\nfrom the influence of the virus of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe objection on the ground of structure loses its force in connection\r\nwith the well known differences in the structure of miliary tubercles\r\nin the human body, already mentioned. The tubercles resulting from\r\ninoculation often resemble in structure the meningeal tubercles of the\r\nbrain rather than the type presented by tubercles in lymphatic glands.\r\nThe development of tubercles in the iris may take place without any\r\npermanent inflammatory reaction. The association of evidences of\r\ninflammation with the development of the tubercle is therefore\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Villemin have not only demonstrated the infectious\r\nnature of tuberculosis, but have also led to a more accurate knowledge\r\nof the relation between tuberculosis and its allied affections,\r\nscrofula and pearly distemper.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical characteristics of scrofula have obviously proved\r\ninsufficient in determining the relation presented by this affection\r\nto tuberculosis. The tendency to cheesy degeneration of its\r\ninflammatory {99} products was the feature of chief importance.\r\nVillemin showed that portions of a scrofulous (cheesy) gland when\r\ninoculated were followed by tuberculosis, and that the inoculation of\r\ncheesy material from non-tuberculous or non-scrofulous sources was not\r\nfollowed by this result. The assumption of Buhl, that the absorption\r\nof cheesy material, as such, was the cause of tuberculosis, was thus\r\ndisproved. The frequency with which the inoculation of cheesy\r\nmaterial, from what were regarded as scrofulous sources, was followed\r\nby tuberculosis, led to more exact studies concerning the anatomical\r\npeculiarities of scrofulous inflammation. Köster[57] called attention\r\nto the regularity of the occurrence of miliary tubercles in the\r\nfungous granulations of the inflamed joints of scrofulous and\r\ntuberculous individuals. Wagner[58] and Schüppel[59] discovered that\r\nscrofulous glands, in most if not in all instances, were tuberculous\r\nglands. The regularity of the presence of tubercles in scrofulous\r\nabscesses and ulcers of the skin and in scrofulous caries was shown by\r\nFriedländer.[60] This observer likewise called attention to the\r\npresence of agglomerated tubercles as the chief constituent of the new\r\nformation of lupus. These anatomical discoveries resulted in uniting\r\nmore closely the affections scrofula and tuberculosis from the\r\nhistological standpoint, and the union has become more firmly cemented\r\nfrom the etiological investigations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1869, xlviii. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Op. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Volksmann's klinische Vorträge_, 1873, lxiv.]\r\n\r\nSchüller[61] has shown that the introduction of finely divided\r\nmaterial from a scrofulous joint--that is, from one containing\r\ntubercles--into the lungs of rabbits was followed by a tuberculosis of\r\nthe tracheal wound, the lungs, and liver. Similar experiments with\r\nreference to the introduction of lupus-tissue produced results\r\nsuggestive of tubercle, if not actually tuberculous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Untersuchungen über die Enstehung und Ursachen der\r\nSkrophulösen und Tuberkulösen Gelenkleiden_, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThe intimacy of relation between tuberculosis and pearly distemper is\r\na necessary result of Villemin's[62] experiment, in which the rabbit\r\nbecame tuberculous after inoculation with fragments of the pearly\r\ntumor. Gerlach,[63] and especially Schüppel,[64] showed that the\r\nstructure of the nodules of the pearly distemper is the same as that\r\nof the tubercles of man, and that the two diseases are identical from\r\nthe histological point of view.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Op. cit._, 537.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1870, li. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Ibid._, 1872, lvi. 38.]\r\n\r\nFrom the anatomical identification and the etiological connection, as\r\nshown by Villemin, Gerlach, and Aufrecht, the pearly distemper became\r\ndesignated as a bovine tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Villemin were further productive in leading to the\r\ndiscovery by Koch of the bacillus tuberculosis. It was early obvious\r\nthat certain cheesy material and gray tubercles possessed the\r\ninfectious qualities, and Villemin[65] maintained that the immediate\r\ncause of the latter was a germ introduced from without, which\r\npropagated and perpetuated itself in man and certain animals. This\r\nview acquired prominence through the investigations of Klebs, who in\r\n1877 claimed to have isolated the micrococci which produced tubercles\r\nwhen injected into animals. Three years later Schüller[66] confirmed\r\nthe statements of Klebs, and asserted that he had been enabled to\r\nobtain infective micrococci by cultivation from {100} miliary\r\ntubercles, scrofulous glands and joints, and from the tissue of lupus.\r\nAufrecht[67] found micrococci, single and in chains, and short\r\nglistening rods, within tubercles resulting from inoculation with\r\nmaterial from pearly tumors. The same organisms were found in\r\ntubercles produced by the inoculation of tubercles from man, and he\r\nregarded these rod-shaped bodies as the specific element productive of\r\nmiliary tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Op. cit._, 620.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _Op. cit._, 55.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Pathologische Mittheilungen_, 1881, p. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe isolation of the virus of tubercle was thus regarded as an open\r\nquestion till the announcement by Koch[68] of the constant presence of\r\na hitherto unknown, characteristic, well defined organism in all\r\ntuberculous affections, which, when isolated and introduced into\r\nanimals, produced tuberculosis, the resulting tubercles likewise\r\ncontaining the organism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1882, p. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe latter, the bacillus tuberculosis, was to be seen in preparations\r\nmethodically treated and carefully stained with aniline colors, by all\r\nof which, excepting the browns, the bacillus was tinged. It was found\r\nin miliary tubercles of the lung, cerebral and intestinal tubercle,\r\ncheesy bronchitis and pneumonia, phthisical sputa, scrofulous glands,\r\nand fungous inflammation of the joints. It was also seen in the\r\nnodules of pearly distemper and in the cheesy masses from the lungs of\r\ncattle. It was furthermore met with in the cheesy lymphatic glands of\r\nswine, in the tubercular nodules of a fowl, and in the tubercles of\r\nguinea-pigs, rabbits, and monkeys. The bacilli were likewise found in\r\nthe tubercles resulting from the inoculation of animals with\r\ntubercular virus from its various sources.\r\n\r\nThe microphytes were described as very slender rods, varying in length\r\nfrom one-fourth the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle to its entire\r\ndiameter, and spores were occasionally seen within the rods. In shape\r\nand size they resembled the bacilli of leprosy, but the latter were\r\nnarrower and pointed at the ends. They were found in greatest\r\nabundance when the tuberculous process was recent and rapidly\r\nadvancing, and were present within, as well as between, cells. The\r\nyounger giant-cells contained them in larger numbers than the older\r\nforms. They were present at the periphery of cheesy nodules rather\r\nthan at the centre.\r\n\r\nThe bacilli were cultivated through successive generations and\r\nrequired a temperature of between 30° C. and 41° C. (86° F.-105.8° F.)\r\nfor their development, one of 37° C. or 38° C. (98.6° F. or 100.4° F.)\r\nbeing the most favorable. The crop first became apparent on the tenth\r\nday after sowing, and the growth extended through a period of three to\r\nfour weeks, forming a compact scale. The cultivated bacilli, even\r\npropagated through several generations, when inoculated, produced the\r\nsame positive results as follow the inoculation of fragments of\r\ntuberculous material, although animals might be used which are not\r\neasily infected with tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nKoch's publication was immediately followed by a statement from\r\nBaumgarten[69] of his discovery of rod-like bacteria in the tubercles\r\nof rabbits resulting from the inoculation with pearly masses, and in\r\nthe pleural and pericardial tubercles of man. They were made evident\r\nby treating the sections for microscopic examination with very dilute\r\nsolutions of soda or potash.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Centralblatt für die med. Wissenschaften_, 1882, xv.\r\n257.]\r\n\r\n{101} The discoveries of Koch thus show that the production of\r\ntuberculosis is dependent upon the presence of distinctive bacilli,\r\nand that these bacilli are present not only in miliary tubercles, but\r\nin scrofulous glands and joints, in cheesy inflammation of the lungs,\r\nand in the pearly distemper of animals. The identification of\r\ntuberculosis with the pearly distemper and certain scrofulous\r\naffections is thus established from the etiological as well as the\r\nhistological point of view.\r\n\r\nAs the bacilli are to be regarded as the virus of tuberculosis, so\r\ntheir introduction into the human body is necessary for the production\r\nof this disease in man. It is obvious, however, that other factors\r\nthan the virus are necessary, for not every one exposed to the\r\nreception of tubercular bacilli becomes tuberculous. It may well be\r\nthat scrofula is still to be regarded as that condition of the solids\r\nand liquids of the body which offers favorable opportunities for the\r\nretention and growth of the bacilli, and thus for the production of\r\ntuberculosis. Formad[70] claims that he has discovered structural\r\npeculiarities of tissue as a cause for the scrofulous habit, which he\r\nregards as synonymous with a predisposition to tuberculosis. These\r\npeculiarities are manifested by a narrowness of the lymph-spaces and\r\ntheir partial obliteration by cellular elements. He also maintains\r\nthat these features are not only of congenital origin, but may be\r\nacquired through malnutrition and confinement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Studies from the Pathological Lab. of the Univ. of\r\nPenna._, reprint, 1882, xi. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a local, circumscribed tuberculosis in extreme old\r\nage, without antecedent or other concurrent evidence of scrofulous\r\ndisturbances, suggests that favorable opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment of the tubercular bacillus may arise in advancing years.\r\nIn like manner, the frequent termination in phthisis of cases of\r\ndiabetes suggests the likelihood of tuberculous inflammation arising\r\nin the absence of any evidence of previous scrofulous or tuberculous\r\ndisease. The scrofulous condition or constitution, as indicated by\r\nvulnerable tissues, with a protracted course of inflammations, and a\r\npersistence of their products, with a tendency to cheesy degeneration,\r\nmay still exist without a sign of tuberculosis. Those who claim that\r\nscrofula and tuberculosis are identical must, in the light of Koch's\r\ndiscovery, demonstrate the presence of the bacillus in all scrofulous\r\ninflammations, and deny the existence of scrofula apart from\r\nindisputable manifestations of the activity of the bacilli of\r\ntuberculosis. It may be that such evidence will be presented; until it\r\nis collected scrofula and tuberculosis are to be regarded as distinct\r\nthough often coexistent. The scrofulous person is frequently\r\ntuberculous, the tuberculous person is usually scrofulous; the\r\nnon-scrofulous person, however, may die of tuberculosis, while the\r\nindividual may be scrofulous without containing tubercle.\r\n\r\nThe actual inheritance of tuberculosis is very unlikely, although this\r\ndisease is frequently found in successive generations of a single\r\nfamily. The various members of the family are rather to be regarded as\r\nfurnishing a suitable soil for the growth of the tubercular bacillus,\r\nand their exposure to its seed is favored by the existence of\r\ntuberculosis in one or more members of the household. The scrofulous\r\ncondition is still to be regarded as hereditary as well as acquired,\r\nand the scrofulous remain as the class to be especially protected from\r\nthe reception and effects of the bacilli of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n{102} It is obviously a matter of importance to determine in any given\r\ncase of phthisis whether bacilli are present or absent. A ready means\r\nof ascertaining this fact is offered by the examination of the sputum\r\nin cases of pulmonary phthisis, the feces in intestinal phthisis, the\r\nurine in renal phthisis, and the aspirated pus in cases of supposed\r\ntuberculosis of the joints. Koch has found in examining the sputa from\r\nnumerous cases of phthisis that the bacilli were present in one-half\r\nthe number, and that they were absent from the sputa of individuals\r\nwho were not phthisical. Balmer and Fraentzel[71] have found bacilli\r\nin the sputum from one hundred and twenty cases of phthisis, and\r\nconcluded that the progress of a case of pulmonary tuberculosis might\r\nbe readily determined from the number and degree of development of the\r\ntypical bacilli present in the sputum. The more numerous and\r\nwell-developed bacilli, with distinct and constant spores, were found\r\nin the graver cases, which advanced more rapidly. The sputum of the\r\nprotracted cases contained few, small, and thin bacilli with scanty\r\nspores. The presence of fever was associated with numerous bacilli,\r\nwhile its absence was noted in those cases where but few were present.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1882, xlv. 679.]\r\n\r\nThe bacilli are readily detected by means of the staining method\r\ndevised by Koch. Various modifications have been presented from time\r\nto time, of which that of Ehrlich[72] has proved the most\r\nsatisfactory. The essential features are to obtain a dry, thin layer\r\nof a selected portion of the suspected sputum, which is then to be\r\ndeeply stained with fuchsin or methyl-violet; the excess of color is\r\nto be removed with nitric acid, and the preparation is then ready for\r\nexamination with the microscope. A power of four or five hundred\r\ndiameters is sufficient for the recognition, and the object should be\r\nilluminated with a flood of light through a large diaphragm or an\r\nachromatic condenser. The bacillus retains the color notwithstanding\r\nits exposure to the acid, and the violet colors are more strongly\r\npresented if the preparation is tinted yellow after the action of the\r\nacid. If the bacilli are stained red with fuchsin, the background\r\nshould be made blue. It is important that the reagents should be\r\nfreshly prepared and filtered, that other bacteria may not obscure the\r\npicture, and that all the apparatus employed should be thoroughly\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: _Allg. med. Centr. Zeitung_, 1882, xxxvii. 458.]\r\n\r\nA fragment of thick, opaque sputum is to be taken in forceps, placed\r\non a cover-glass, and spread into a thin layer by means of a second\r\ncover-glass. The prepared slide is then to be passed slowly through an\r\nalcoholic flame, or that of a Bunsen burner, till the layer of sputum\r\nis dried. A saturated alcoholic solution of methyl-violet or fuchsin\r\nis made and filtered, and added, drop by drop, to a filtered,\r\nsaturated solution of aniline oil shaken in water. The color is to be\r\nadded with stirring till an opalescent film forms on the surface of\r\nthe mixture. The slide containing the dried sputum is to be placed in\r\nor on this staining fluid, and allowed to remain for half an hour or\r\nless, the application of warmth hastening the process, when it is\r\nremoved, and the specimen is decolorized in a solution of one part of\r\nnitric acid and two parts of water. The preparation is then washed in\r\nwater, and may be examined directly in water, glycerin, or, after\r\ndehydration in alcohol, in oil of cloves. The tinted bacilli are made\r\nmore prominent by a secondary staining, for a minute or two, of the\r\nred (fuchsin) preparation {103} in a concentrated solution of\r\nmethyl-blue, the violet preparation being secondarily stained in a\r\nlike solution of aniline-brown. If the preparation is to be\r\npermanently preserved, it should be dehydrated in strong alcohol after\r\nwashing with water, and it may then be treated with oil of cloves and\r\nmounted in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nAfter the observer has become thoroughly familiar with the tubercle\r\nbacilli by means of the method of Ehrlich, much time may be saved by\r\nfollowing that of Baumgarten.[73] The cover-glass bearing the dried\r\nsputum is placed in a very dilute solution of caustic potash (two\r\ndrops of a 33 per cent. solution in a watch-glass of distilled water)\r\ntill the layer of sputum becomes transparent. The cover is then placed\r\non a slide moistened with a drop of water, tapped slightly, and\r\nexamined with the microscope. The bacilli are readily seen, and may be\r\ndifferentiated from other varieties of bacteria, if necessary, by\r\nagain drying the object and examining it in a drop of a dilute watery\r\nsolution of aniline-violet or of other preparations of aniline used\r\nfor staining nuclei. The tubercle bacilli remain unstained, while\r\nputrefactive bacteria are tinted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Centralblatt für die med. Wissenschaften_, 1882, xxv.\r\n433.]\r\n\r\nThe tubercular products of the invasion of the body by the bacillus\r\ntuberculosis are regarded as primary or secondary, according as they\r\nare present at that part of the body which directly receives the\r\norganisms or as they are dependent upon the transfer of the latter to\r\nparts remote from the region of their admission and immediate effects.\r\nThis differing relation is also expressed by the terms local and\r\ngeneral tuberculosis. In the former the bacilli excite the growth of\r\ntubercle only at a given part of the body. Their apparent effects may\r\nbe wholly limited to this region, and it not rarely happens that the\r\nsame is quite distant from the channels through which the bacilli are\r\nadmitted. A general tuberculosis occurs when the latter are\r\ndisseminated over the body, and their effects, especially the\r\nproduction of numerous tubercles, are found at various parts. The\r\ndissemination may take place at the time of entrance, or, as is more\r\ncommonly the case, apparently occurs at some subsequent period, the\r\nimmediate disturbances being localized at a given portion of the body.\r\nThe necessary conditions being here offered for the propagation of the\r\nbacilli, their sudden distribution in great numbers is afterward\r\npermitted when favorable opportunities arise for their absorption.\r\nSuch conditions are present when the local tubercular growths extend\r\ninto lymphatics or blood-vessels. The frequency with which scrofulous\r\nglands are tuberculous--that is, contain miliary tubercles--is already\r\nfully recognized, and a tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands is\r\nessentially regional. These glands become affected in consequence of\r\ndisturbances, the local effects of which may have wholly disappeared,\r\nin the region from which they receive their lymph. The cervical glands\r\nbecome permanently enlarged, perhaps tuberculous, in connection with\r\npersistent or recurrent inflammatory processes in the tonsils and\r\npharynx, the bronchial glands from similar bronchial or pulmonary\r\naffections, and the mesenteric glands from like intestinal\r\ndisturbances. In such instances, the direct reception of the bacilli\r\ninto the lymph-current is assumed rather than demonstrated from a\r\nknowledge of the possibilities of absorption and an appreciation of\r\nthe conditions in the glands.\r\n\r\nThat an actual growth of tubercles from the wall of the intestinal\r\n{104} lymphatics may take place has long been known, and Ponfick has\r\nrecently discovered that tubercles may be found growing from the wall\r\nof the thoracic duct. The possibility of the direct admission into the\r\nlymph-current of the infective element in tuberculosis is thus\r\napparent, and its indirect entrance into the blood-current is equally\r\nobvious. That the bacillus of tubercle may be directly received into\r\nthe blood-current is likewise evident from the observations of\r\nWeigert, who found tubercles growing from the walls of the pulmonary\r\nblood-vessels, venous as well as arterial. This discovery of a\r\ntuberculosis of the blood-vessels was confirmed by Klebs, who had\r\nfound a tuberculosis of the azygos veins. The occurrence of multiple\r\nmiliary tubercles of the pulmonary veins, especially near the place of\r\nentrance of smaller branches, has been asserted by Mügge,[74] although\r\nappearances similar to those described by him may be met with, due\r\nsimply to the agglomeration of white blood-corpuscles and their\r\nnecrosis. Such a condition simulates very closely the miliary\r\ntubercle, but is usually analogous to the appearances figured by\r\nVirchow,[75] and described by him as one of the phenomena of\r\ncoagulation. In his observation the white bodies were adherent to the\r\nred clots, and were with them drawn from the pulmonary artery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1879, lxxvi. 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Die Cellular Pathologie_, 4te Auflage, 1871, 184.]\r\n\r\nWith the admission into the body, and the colonization of the\r\ntubercular bacilli, their effects may either be progressive until the\r\ndeath of the individual is occasioned, or, with the cessation of the\r\ngrowth of the bacilli or a possible modification of their noxious\r\nproperties, recovery may ensue. The history of scrofulous glands, as\r\nwell as that of circumscribed pulmonary inflammation in scrofulous\r\npersons, both presumably of a tuberculous nature, show that the\r\neffects of an invasion of the parasites may be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe regions of the body which are usually the seat of a primary\r\ntuberculosis are unquestionably the respiratory and intestinal tracts.\r\nWith regard to the first of these regions, the one most frequently\r\naffected, there can be no doubt that in most instances the inhaled air\r\ncarries the bacilli or their spores, or both. Their constant presence\r\nin the sputum of the frequent cases of tuberculous phthisis suggests a\r\nready means for their escape into the atmosphere. The well recognized\r\ninfective qualities of the sputum, as demonstrated by the various\r\nexperiments before the bacillus was discovered, demand the thorough\r\ndisinfection of phthisical sputa, since these are in all probability\r\nthe chief source of the dissemination of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe tuberculosis of the intestine in like manner is to be regarded in\r\nthe main as the result of an absorption from its surface of the\r\nspecific agent. An obvious direct means of the approach of the bacilli\r\nis offered in the sputum, which, when swallowed, is likely to retain\r\nits virulent properties. The frequent coexistence of chronic pulmonary\r\nand intestinal tuberculosis is thus most readily explained. To what\r\nextent the presence of the bacilli in the pearly distemper of cattle\r\nand in the tuberculosis of other edible domesticated animals, as fowls\r\nand swine, may lead to an infection of the intestinal wall, still\r\nremains an unsolved problem. It is not yet determined at what\r\ntemperatures the bacilli are destroyed, although their growth takes\r\nplace only between 30° C. (86° F.) and {105} 41° C. (105.8° F.). The\r\ninoculation of pearly masses produces tuberculosis in certain animals,\r\nyet the effect of cooking in destroying the bacilli and their spores\r\nis likely to prove of great importance. Aufrecht's[76] attempts at\r\ninoculating rabbits with cooked pearly masses proved unsuccessful.\r\nSchottelius[77] publishes an interesting series of observations\r\nrelating to the prolonged use of meat from cattle affected with the\r\npearly distemper, and shows that after a period of years no disease of\r\nthe nature of tuberculosis occurred among the one hundred and thirty\r\nindividuals included in the families concerned. Whatever may be the\r\nvalue of this negative testimony, there is, as yet, no evidence on the\r\nother side which satisfactorily determines the point in question--viz.\r\nthat the flesh of animals affected with pearly distemper produces\r\ntuberculosis in the human consumer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Op. cit._, 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1883, xci. 129.]\r\n\r\nThe milk from cows thus diseased has likewise been regarded with\r\nsuspicion, and the frequency of intestinal tuberculosis among children\r\nhas been attributed to this source. Although the theoretical\r\npossibility of the escape of the bacilli into the milk of cows\r\naffected with pearly distemper is obvious, their presence in such milk\r\nis first to be demonstrated under conditions which necessitate their\r\norigin from the animal. If boiling the infective material for three\r\nminutes destroys its virulence, as claimed by Aufrecht, a ready means\r\nis offered of destroying the tubercle bacilli which may be present,\r\nnot only in the milk from animals affected with pearly distemper, but\r\nin all milk which has been exposed for a certain time to an atmosphere\r\nwhich may contain the bacilli of tuberculosis. In the light of our\r\npresent knowledge extreme hygienic precautions are only demanded in\r\nthose cases where such a congenital or acquired basis (constitution)\r\nis present as facilitates the development of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorbid Growths.\r\n\r\nIn a system of practical medicine it is obviously important to include\r\nunder the head of Morbid Growths not only what is spoken of by the\r\nsurgeon as a tumor, but also those new formations of tissue which, in\r\nvirtue of their nature, seat, manner of growth, and retrograde\r\nchanges, produce an important series of disturbances in the\r\nphysiological processes of the individual. The surgeon deals\r\nessentially with the swelling, which, producing irregularities in the\r\noutline of the accessible surfaces of the body, is regarded as an\r\nexcrescence or outgrowth. It is important for him to realize the\r\nnature of this swelling, that he may follow a different treatment for\r\nthe abscess, the wen, the watery accumulation, or the fleshy mass. The\r\nlast is the tumor in the limited sense; it is the growth which, though\r\ncalled morbid, becomes so only in consequence of its presence being\r\nassociated with symptoms whose existence and persistence interfere\r\nwith the well-being of the possessor.\r\n\r\nThe physician, on the contrary, is more concerned with the tumor as a\r\ngrowth than as a swelling. The latter element in deeply-seated\r\nportions of the body may not be brought to his attention. The growth\r\ntakes place in such a manner as to be productive of certain symptoms\r\nmore or less serious, among which swelling is least obvious. The\r\nmorbid {106} growth to him becomes prominent as it displaces or\r\nreplaces normal tissues by those newly formed, which may or may not be\r\nnormal to the part in which the growth is situated. His tumor is\r\ntherefore a morbid growth, a new formation, a neoplasm or pseudoplasm,\r\nrather than a swelling, a bunch, or an excrescence.\r\n\r\nIn a consideration of the general pathology of morbid growths the\r\nfirst question which suggests itself relates to the method of origin\r\nof the tumor. The tendency of the present seeks for a local cause, and\r\nthe most recent theory, that of Cohnheim, demands an accumulation of\r\ndormant embryonal cells as such a cause. Cohnheim supports this view\r\nby the experiments of Zahn and Leopold, which show that foetal\r\ncartilage transplanted into the tissues of a mature animal may grow so\r\nrapidly as to present the characteristics of a cartilaginous tumor,\r\nwhile tissues transferred from the animal after birth do not increase\r\nin size, but are usually absorbed.\r\n\r\nAs the active elements of the growth are cells, and all cells\r\nadmissibly arise from pre-existing cells, it follows that the\r\nprimitive cells of a tumor are derived from those resulting from the\r\nsegmentation of the ovum or are introduced from without. Numerous\r\nexperiments have been made with a view to the inoculation of tumors,\r\nthe transplantation of living fragments of the latter to the living\r\ntissues of a healthy individual, for the sake of producing a tumor,\r\nbut hitherto almost invariably without success. The alternative\r\nremains that the embryonal cells are those whose derivatives are\r\npresent in, and form the essential element of, the morbid growth. All\r\ntumors may thus be said to have an embryonal origin. As the\r\nsegmentation of the ovum eventually results in the production of\r\nnormal tissues and groups of tissues whose structure and function are\r\nwholly different, so the possibility of the production of abnormal\r\ngroupings of tissue with corresponding irregular manifestations of\r\nfunction is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the part from which a tumor arises may be regarded as\r\nindifferent, those whose limitations of growth, like the early\r\nembryonal cells, are only determined by the changes they undergo, or\r\ntheir limits of growth may be already defined in kind, and their like\r\nbe produced in the formation of the tumor. The origin of a tumor thus\r\npresupposes the existence of such indifferent cells, or the presence\r\nof those whose limit of transformation has already been reached. The\r\nleucocytes of the body, whether found as white blood-corpuscles or\r\nlymph-corpuscles, or as the wandering cells of connective tissue, are,\r\nas Virchow has indicated, such indifferent cells. Always present and\r\napparently transitory, what they are to become can only be determined\r\nfrom their condition and surroundings at the time of observation.\r\nAlthough their actual transformation into the various cells of a more\r\npermanent type is merely a matter of inference in the growth of\r\ntumors, the evidence presented by Ziegler[78] leads directly to the\r\nconclusion that their presence is necessary to the new formation of\r\ntissues whose growth is the result of an inflammatory process. These\r\ntissues may occur under such restrictions as permit them to be\r\nclassified as tumors, and the granulomata, or tumors whose tissue\r\nresembles that of the granulations upon the surface of a wound,\r\nrepresent a well defined group in structure as well as method of\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _Op. cit._, 150.]\r\n\r\n{107} The production of the cells of a tumor from indifferent cells is\r\nat present an assumption, based upon the frequent presence of the\r\nlatter within tumors and in their vicinity; and the obvious objection\r\narises that even if the presence of these cells is admitted as\r\nindispensable, it by no means follows that they are directly\r\ntransformed into the more characteristic cells of the tumor. That they\r\nmay serve for the nourishment of the amoeboid cells of certain tumors\r\nis suggested by the existence of both in morbid growths, and the\r\nwell-known property of amoeboid corpuscles to take in formed material,\r\neven cells, from without.\r\n\r\nThe origin of tumors from cells whose limits of growth are already\r\ndefined is rendered probable from the absence, entire or in great\r\npart, of indifferent cells from certain tumors, and the direct\r\ncontinuity of the latter with a similar normal tissue of the body.\r\nVarious tumors show such an intimate relation, and there is no sharply\r\ndefined border-line between the normal tissue and that which\r\nrepresents the tumor. The occasional presence of islets of well\r\ncharacterized tissue at points more or less remote from the normal\r\nposition of such tissue at the time of their discovery suggests a\r\nfeasible source for an eventual tumor. Virchow long ago called\r\nattention to isolated nodules of cartilage within bones in the\r\nvicinity of epiphyseal cartilages, probably detached from the latter,\r\nwhich might serve as the origin of a cartilaginous tumor in this\r\nregion. This inclusion of tissue is also suggested by the frequency of\r\ncertain tumors in certain regions where the developmental conditions\r\nare favorable. Lücke[79] mentions the frequency of dermoid cysts near\r\nthe median line of the head, the vicinity of the eye, and the side of\r\nthe neck. Such regions are those where fissures exist during foetal\r\nlife, with normal involutions of the outer germinal layer; which\r\ninvolutions may become irregular, and eventually included or shut in,\r\nas the fissures become closed. A similar explanation is offered for\r\nthe frequent occurrence of cartilaginous tumors at the angle of the\r\njaw, it being thought probable that bits of embryonal cartilage,\r\nduring the formation of the ear, become included in the salivary\r\nglands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Volkmann's Sammlung klinischer Vorträge_, xcvii. 819.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, Cohnheim explains the frequent occurrence of certain\r\nepithelial tumors at the orifices of the body--the cervix uteri and\r\nthe vicinity of the tracheal bifurcation--not through the exposure of\r\nthese parts to injury, but because they are regions in which embryonal\r\nirregularities of development are likely to arise.\r\n\r\nThat congenital, local peculiarities are an important element in the\r\norigin of tumors has already been strongly advocated by Virchow. Not\r\nonly are children born with tumors, but instances of growths\r\neventually arising from birth-marks, and the occurrence of certain\r\ntumors in the same locality in successive generations of the same\r\nfamily, are sufficiently familiar.\r\n\r\nAlthough certain tumors are admitted to be due to congenital\r\npeculiarities of tissue, and even to represent atypical growths from\r\nembryonal tissue, the theory of such an embryonal origin for all\r\ntumors seems unnecessary. The resemblance in symptoms as well as in\r\nappearance, and even in structure, of certain tumors to inflammatory\r\nproducts, and their frequent association with these, has led to the\r\nsuggestion of an irritant as an exciting cause for the tumor, even in\r\nthe absence of local peculiarities of tissue. {108} It is obvious that\r\nwere the embryonal theory of origin, as extended by Cohnheim,\r\nuniversally applicable, the growth demands something more than a focus\r\nof embryonal cells. An immediate cause for their growth after a\r\ndormant period, extending even into old age, is required. Cohnheim\r\nfinds such in a sufficient supply of blood. He attributes the\r\ndevelopment or rapid growth of the tumor to this feature, and supports\r\nhis view by the usual appearance of exostoses when the skeleton is at\r\nits period of most vigorous growth, and of dermoid cysts at a time\r\nwhen the formation of the beard indicates active developmental\r\nconditions in the outer germinal layer.\r\n\r\nThe growth of ovarian cystomata at and after puberty, and of these and\r\nmammary tumors during pregnancy, are also explained on the ground of a\r\nmore abundant supply of blood at such periods. He and others find in\r\nphysiological conditions a source for the abundant blood-supply--that\r\nis, the efficient nutrition for the growth of a tumor. The necessity\r\nof sufficient nutrition in the development of tumors is universally\r\nadmitted, and its source may be looked for in pathological as well as\r\nphysiological conditions.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an irritant of some sort often seems probable, and,\r\nalthough its absence is more frequently determined than its presence,\r\nit is obvious that when present it may be overlooked. Although\r\ntraumatic irritants of considerable mechanical severity exist in but a\r\nsmall percentage of tumors, their occasional influence in the\r\nproduction of morbid growths is not to be denied. Their action may be\r\nexplained as producing a congestion or as enfeebling the opposition of\r\nphysiological tissues to pathological growths. The importance of an\r\nirritant as the exciting cause, however its action may take place, is\r\nsupported not only by the sequence of injuries and tumors, but also by\r\nthe frequent occurrence of tumors in parts exposed to injury and\r\nirritation. Such exposure may result from position, structure, or\r\nfunction. The orifices and prominences of the body, the retained\r\ntestis in the inguinal canal, are notoriously liable seats of tumors.\r\nSoft, friable, and slightly resistant structures, like mucous\r\nmembranes, are not only the frequent place of origin of tumors, but\r\nthe most exposed parts of such structures are oftenest affected. The\r\nexposure resulting from function is manifest by the relation presented\r\nby the periods of greatest functional activity of the growth of tumors\r\nin such organs as the mammary gland, uterus, and ovaries.\r\n\r\nThe importance of an irritant is still further suggested by the\r\nassociation of tumors with inflammation. The growth of tubercles and\r\ncancer from serous membranes is frequently accompanied by an acute\r\ninflammation of the latter; fibrous tumors and chronic interstitial\r\ninflammations often coexist, while elephantiasis is usually preceded\r\nby recurrent, erysipelatous inflammation of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe recent discovery of infective organisms as an exciting cause for\r\nmany of the members of an entire group of tumors, the granulomata, has\r\nresulted in making prominent the etiological rather than the\r\nstructural features of the tumors concerned.\r\n\r\nLocal peculiarities of tissue, whether congenital or acquired, are\r\nthus regarded as representing the beginnings of the growth. With the\r\nmultiplication of the cells their transformation may take place or a\r\nchange in their grouping may arise. The essential condition in the\r\nproduction {109} of the morbid growth is that the formation of the\r\ncells should take place at an abnormal time or place and should\r\nprogress in a normal or abnormal manner.\r\n\r\nThe growth takes place with greater or less rapidity in one or another\r\ndirection according to the nature of the tumor and its seat. The more\r\nclosely the tumor resembles the normal structures of the body, the\r\nslower is its growth; the more it differs in composition, the more\r\nrapid is its progress. This difference may arise from a predominance\r\nof cells over intercellular substance, as in the case of the sarcoma,\r\nor it may result from an atypical combination of tissues, as seen in\r\nthe development of epithelium and connective tissue in cancer.\r\n\r\nThe seat of the tumor is of importance mainly on account of the\r\nvascular supply of a part and the more spongy or yielding nature of\r\ncertain regions. That the more abundant the nutrition of certain\r\nregions of the body, the more favorable the opportunities for growth,\r\nmay be admitted without question. The spongy nature of tissues implies\r\na predominance of cavities over solid constituents. These cavities are\r\nlined by surfaces which represent, on the one hand, the walls of\r\nlymph-spaces, on the other the free surfaces of the body exposed to\r\nthe air, as the mucous or cutaneous surfaces and the pulmonary\r\nsurface. The rapidity of growth in the direction of the least\r\nresistance is amply shown in the projection of tumors above the\r\nsurface of serous membranes and the frequent presence of fungoid\r\nexcrescences in various parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe growth of tumors extends in all directions, but a distinction has\r\nlong been drawn between the concentric or interstitial manner of\r\ngrowth and the excentric or infiltrating form. This distinction is\r\nbased upon the presence of a sharply defined limitation of\r\npathological and normal tissues or upon the absence of such a\r\nlimitation. Such a distinction is merely of relative importance, as\r\ncertain tumors may grow in both ways. This is best observed in those\r\nbulging superficial tumors whose base is irregularly extended into the\r\ncontinuous healthy tissues.\r\n\r\nThe concentric variety of growth includes those tumors which have\r\ncommonly been described as encapsulated, and which are capable of\r\nready enucleation from their surroundings in virtue of a thin layer of\r\nloose connective tissue lying between the tumor and the contiguous\r\ntissue. Such a capsule represents the matrix, the pia mater, in which\r\nlie the blood-vessels going to and coming from the tumor, and is often\r\nnothing else than the distended and hyperplastic fibrous tissue\r\nremaining after the absorption of the muscular fibres or gland-cells\r\nfrom the tissues surrounding the morbid growth.\r\n\r\nThe excentric, peripheral, or infiltrating extension of the tumor\r\ntakes place when the surrounding parts are invaded by the active\r\nelements of which the tumor is composed. The amoeboid property of the\r\ncells of certain tumors is well known, and the possibility is\r\nadmissible that the indifferent cells of the body, so often\r\naccumulated at the periphery of the growth, become impregnated with a\r\nformative function by the constituents of the tumor. Such amoeboid and\r\nwandering cells represent a means through which the growth of the\r\ntumor may become extended in its vicinity as well as in more remote\r\nparts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe extension in the vicinity may be continuous or the reverse, the\r\nlatter through the formation of secondary nodules, which may {110}\r\neventually become fused with the primary mass. The continuous growth\r\ntakes place, as has been more particularly shown by Köster, along the\r\nlymph-channels surrounding the tumor, which may become filled,\r\ndistended, and eventually obliterated by projections from the\r\nneoplasm. Both methods of peripheral growth, by secondary nodules and\r\ncontinuous extension, represent an infection of the surrounding\r\ntissues, especially if it be admitted that the cells through which the\r\nincrease is accomplished are direct descendants of the pre-existing\r\ncells of the part. Not only does the extension take place through the\r\nlymphatic vessels about the tumor, but blood-spaces as well as\r\nlymph-spaces may be invaded. Thrombi are then found whose structure is\r\nfrequently that of the tumor, and whose connection with the same is\r\ndirect through the perforated wall of the vessel. These features in\r\nthe growth of tumors lead directly to the consideration of the means\r\nby which multiple tumors appear in remote parts of the body after a\r\nsingle tumor has appeared in a given locality, and after the removal\r\nof such a primitive growth.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between primary and secondary tumors is now so obvious\r\nthat one is inclined to forget that the presence of numerous tumors at\r\nvarious parts of the body was at one time regarded as evidence of the\r\nconstitutional or dyscrasic nature of the morbid growth. Such a\r\nmultiplicity seemed to indicate that the blood was charged with the\r\nconstituents of the tumor, which were deposited at various parts of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nAlthough certain multiple tumors may be present in different\r\nlocalities without an apparent relation between an antecedent and a\r\nsubsequent growth, such tumors are usually limited to certain systems\r\nof the body. Multiple bony tumors are found growing from bones,\r\nfibrous and warty tumors from the skin, and fibro-myomata from the\r\nuterus. Cohnheim's theory of the embryonal origin of tumors may seem\r\napplicable in such cases, but the frequent association of the\r\nosteomata with chronic inflammatory conditions, of cutaneous warts and\r\nfibrous tumors with local irritative processes, makes such a\r\nhypothesis unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThose tumors whose multiplicity is of the greatest clinical importance\r\nare the rapidly growing forms terminating fatally. Such are those\r\nwhich reappear in the scar after the removal of a cancer, or in the\r\nadjoining chain of lymphatic glands or at remote parts of the body.\r\nThe most satisfactory explanation of their presence, and of the\r\ngeneralization, recurrence, or metastasis of tumors, is derived from\r\nwhat has already been stated with reference to the manner of the\r\ngrowth of the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is well known from experiments on animals that various living,\r\nnormal tissues when transplanted to remote parts of the same\r\nindividual or to other individuals may continue to grow. Cohnheim\r\nclaims, as has been previously stated, that a distinction is to be\r\ndrawn in this respect between the tissues of the adult and the foetus,\r\nwhere the genesis of tumors is concerned. This observer, in connection\r\nwith Maas,[80] has found that the transplanted material (periosteum),\r\nalthough growing for a while, disappears at the end of five weeks, and\r\nit is asserted that fragments of tumors, when transferred, suffer a\r\nsimilar fate. Wile,[81] on the contrary, {111} who has experimented\r\nwith reference to the fate of transplanted tissues and portions of\r\ntumors, reports that one hundred days after the transfer of periosteum\r\nthe lung was found to contain several centres of ossification. He\r\nregards the latter as proceeding from the fragments of periosteum\r\nintroduced into the jugular vein, and his results thus widely differ\r\nfrom those of Cohnheim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1877, lxx. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _The Pathogenesis of Secondary Tumors_, reprint from\r\n_Philadelphia Med. Times_, July, Aug., and Sept., 1882.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous experiments which have been made in\r\nvarious parts of the world to excite the growth of transplanted bits\r\nfrom tumors, most of them have terminated unsuccessfully. Although a\r\ntemporary growth of fragments of tumors has taken place after\r\ntransplantation, their eventual disappearance has usually occurred.\r\nCohnheim lays stress upon this fact in connection with his theory of\r\nthe origin of tumors. He considers that the fragments of tissue and\r\ntumors disappear in consequence of the inability of the foreign\r\nparticles to withstand the metamorphosis of physiological tissues. If\r\nthis opposition is neutralized, the existing germs of tumors become\r\ncapable of development. Wile, however, found that eight weeks after\r\nthe introduction of a bit of cancer into the lung of an animal the\r\nfragment had increased nearly twice in size. He also refers to the\r\npositive experiments of Newinsky,[82] who transplanted a bit of cancer\r\nfrom a dog to the subcutaneous tissue of another, young dog, and\r\nfound, after five months, not only an ulcerating cutaneous cancer at\r\nthe place of inoculation, but also a metastatic nodule of the size of\r\na hazel-nut in an axillary lymphatic gland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: _Allgem. medicinische Central-Zeitung_, 1876, lxxi.\r\n875.]\r\n\r\nFor the present consideration it may be borne in mind that fragments\r\nof normal (foetal) tissues, as shown by the experiments of Zahn and\r\nLeopold, when introduced into the organs of animals, may become\r\nenlarged. It is also certain that bits of tumors, after their\r\nintroduction into the tissues and organs of animals, have become\r\nincreased in size. What their eventual fate might have been does not\r\nappear; and herein lies the weak point of the experiments with\r\nreference to the production of secondary tumors. For such experiments\r\nto be regarded as crucial it is necessary that a large number of\r\npreviously healthy animals, after inoculation with fragments of morbid\r\ngrowths, should present in various parts of the body well\r\ncharacterized tumors whose structure should be like that of the\r\nparticles introduced.\r\n\r\nThe experiments above referred to are of value in confirming the views\r\nconcerning the generalization of tumors which have been generally\r\nadmitted since Virchow's discoveries with regard to the phenomena of\r\nembolism.\r\n\r\nTumors are said to become generalized when they appear not only in\r\nvarious systems of the body, but in various organs and tissues. They\r\nare found usually in considerable numbers, and with such differences\r\nin size, shape, and appearance as to indicate different ages. Such\r\ntumors are regarded as arising directly or indirectly from a common\r\nsource. This source is called the primitive or primary tumor, and its\r\nderivatives the secondary tumors. The latter are usually considered as\r\nthe direct descendants of the former, although their relation may be\r\nthat of several successive generations.\r\n\r\nThe primitive tumor in its growth may extend into lymphatics and\r\nblood-vessels, as has already been suggested. Such an extension may be\r\n{112} so little obvious when the tumor is removed by the surgeon that\r\nall diseased tissues are apparently separated from the body. A\r\nrecurrence of the tumor is said to take place when the growth returns\r\nin the cicatrix, frequently in a multiple form. The explanation of\r\nsuch a recurrence is based upon the probable presence, at the time of\r\nthe operation, of fragments of the tumor within the tissues forming\r\nthe base and edges of the wound. During and after the healing of the\r\nwound their growth is supposed to continue till they become apparent\r\nas small tumors. The progress of these recurrent tumors is at times\r\nextremely rapid, and they may attain a considerable size in the course\r\nof a few weeks. Such nodules are secondary in point of time, although\r\nthey were actually a part of the primary growth.\r\n\r\nSecondary nodules in descent as well as time are those which appear at\r\ndistant parts, often after the discovery of the primary tumor. Such\r\nnodules are regarded as resulting from the transfer of particles of\r\nvarious size from the primitive growth, either through the\r\nlymph-vessels or blood-vessels. If the invasion of the body takes\r\nplace through the former, the fragments may be floated along to the\r\nnearest lymphatic gland, where it remains when too large to pass\r\nthrough. If it retains the capacity of growth or of stimulating a like\r\ngrowth, there results a more or less complete transformation of the\r\ngland into a morbid tissue like that from which the fragments came.\r\nAdjoining lymph-glands may become infected from the first, until\r\neventually an entire series becomes more or less completely\r\ntransformed into morbid growths. A like invasion of the lymphatic\r\nglands may take place through a continuous extension along the\r\nlymph-vessels; and it is not rare to find the sub-pleural or\r\nsub-peritoneal lymphatics as an elevated meshwork in consequence of\r\nthe neoplastic growth within them. Such a method of extension may take\r\nplace when a cancer of the stomach or liver is associated with a\r\ncancer of the pleura, the intervening lymphatics of the diaphragm\r\noffering a direct and continuous communication.\r\n\r\nWith the outcropping of a tumor upon a serous surface the possibility\r\nof the detachment of particles is at hand. These may become\r\ntransplanted to the opposed serous surface or may be transferred to\r\nthe most dependent parts, and there serve as seed for subsequent\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe probability of the embolic nature of many secondary tumors was\r\nearly suggested in the history of embolism. Rapidly growing tumors\r\nwere known to be capable of perforating the walls of adjacent\r\nblood-vessels, especially veins, and to continue growing along the\r\ncourse of such vessels. The possibility of the detachment of portions\r\nof these tumors and their transfer along the course of the circulation\r\nwas an inevitable inference from the results of experimentation with\r\nforeign bodies. Cancerous emboli were thus recognized as a possible\r\nvariety, and their distribution was subject to the same laws as those\r\ngoverning emboli otherwise constituted. Multiple nodules were\r\nfrequently found in the lungs in connection with tumors growing into\r\nthe inferior vena cava, while multiple nodules in the liver were\r\nusually associated with tumors of the gastro-intestinal canal or other\r\nregions whose vessels formed a part of the portal circulation. The\r\nreadiness with which portions may be detached after death from the\r\nsoft masses projecting into the interior of veins suggests the ease\r\nwith which particles may be {113} separated during life. The\r\nexperiments already referred to show that isolated fragments of tissue\r\nserving as emboli may grow in the place of their reception, and it is\r\npresumable that the resulting growth takes place under the same\r\nconditions as those prevailing at the place from which the embolus\r\nstarted. The question whether the secondary tumor arises from the\r\nreproduction of elements transferred from the primitive disease, or\r\nwhether these excite a characteristic, specific growth of the cells in\r\nthe place of their retention, may still be regarded as open. The\r\nexperiments favor the former view, and they alone are capable of\r\nsatisfactorily determining the point in question.\r\n\r\nThe secondary nodules, whatever may be their method of origin, present\r\nthe peculiarities of the primitive growth. If the cells of the latter\r\nare pigmented, those of the former show the same peculiarity. If the\r\nstructure of the primitive tumor contains bone, cartilage, or squamous\r\nepithelium, the secondary growths show like characters, though they\r\nmay be present in the heart or other organs where such tissues are not\r\npresent as normal constituents. So constant and characteristic is this\r\nfeature that the structure of the tumor is usually as well displayed\r\nin the examination of the secondary as of the primitive nodule.\r\nIndeed, the structural peculiarities of the growth may be more\r\ncharacteristically shown in the former in those instances where the\r\nprimitive tumor has undergone degenerative changes obscuring its\r\nhistological features.\r\n\r\nThe tissues of the tumor are subject to the various changes which take\r\nplace in the normal tissues of the body. Their growth is attended with\r\na multiplication of cells and a formation of intercellular substance.\r\nTumors whose growth is the most rapid are those whose blood-vessels\r\nare the most numerous and whose relation to the cells is most\r\nintimate. The slower the advance of the tumor, the more permanent is\r\nit likely to become, while the more rapid the progress, the more\r\ntransitory are its elements. The growth may continue, and yet the\r\nactual size of the tumor may diminish through the absorption of its\r\ndegenerated parts. The cells of the neoplasm may undergo fatty\r\ndegeneration, or they may become cornified. They may undergo the\r\nmucous metamorphosis or the amyloid and colloid degenerations. They\r\nmay take up pigment or they may produce the same. The intercellular\r\nsubstance varies in its character as does that of normal tissues. It\r\nmay be slimy, homogeneous, or fibrillated. It may contain mucin,\r\nchondrin, or gelatin, and may be infiltrated with calcareous salts.\r\nLimited necroses with characteristic cheesy appearances are of\r\nfrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nTumors may become the seat of inflammatory processes, indicated by\r\nsuppuration and fever, which may result in abscess or gangrene, or\r\ntheir progress may terminate in the production of scars. Ulceration\r\nmay occur in consequence of the extension of an inflammatory process\r\nto the surface, or it may result in the course of the degenerative\r\nsoftening of a tumor. In both cases the cutaneous or mucous surface is\r\ninvolved and destroyed, and the interior of the tumor being exposed\r\nputrefactive processes, with fistulæ and sinuses, arise, the latter\r\nfavoring the retention of the product and the persistence of the\r\ninflammatory process.\r\n\r\nTumors are always pathological, but the resulting disturbances vary\r\nwithin wide limits and are often of a complex character. The familiar\r\ndistinction between benignant and malignant tumors is based chiefly\r\n{114} upon this variance in the nature of the disturbances. Those are\r\nbenignant which closely resemble the normal structures of the body,\r\nincrease but slowly, and, if they attain a large size, produce mainly\r\nmechanical disturbances. They may prove serious, even fatal, if so\r\nseated as to interfere with the function of important parts of the\r\nbody. Very large and heavy tumors may prove burdensome solely on\r\naccount of their weight, while others of similar character, elsewhere\r\nseated, may interfere with respiration or circulation, and eventually\r\nwith nutrition. Tumors in exposed situations may become important only\r\nin virtue of their liability to injury, while others impede the\r\nfunction of a part or an organ by pressure upon its nerves and vessels\r\nor by obstructing its ducts.\r\n\r\nThe malignant tumors, on the contrary, differ in their structure from\r\nthe normal tissues of the body. Their growth is rapid and infiltrating\r\nrather than slow and concentric. Such tumors usually have a\r\npredominance of cells and thin walled blood-vessels. The former may be\r\nlittle else than nuclei enveloped in an easily destructible\r\nprotoplasm, or they may be composed of multi-nucleated masses of\r\nprotoplasm, and are then known as giant-cells. The most malignant\r\ntumors are those which tend to become generalized as well as to spread\r\nlocally. They recur locally, and appear in the nearest lymph-glands\r\nand at remote parts of the body. The disturbances produced by the\r\nmalignant tumors depend less upon their mechanical relations than upon\r\ntheir tendency to destroy tissues and disturb functions. With their\r\npresence and progress in vital organs there is associated, from their\r\nmanner of growth, a destruction of the cells of such organs, as the\r\nkidneys and liver, the lungs and heart. When they are seated in the\r\nspleen and lymphatic glands, a disturbance in the blood-making process\r\nmust be associated. Their occurrence in the alimentary canal opposes\r\nthe admission, digestion, and expulsion of its contents, and produces\r\ndisturbances varying as to the seat and peculiarities of the tumor.\r\nThe progress of the malignant tumor is often associated with\r\nulceration, watery discharges, and hemorrhage. The frequent\r\ncoexistence of emaciation, weakness, anæmia, and a yellowish\r\ndiscoloration of the skin forms a group of disturbances which,\r\nincluded under the name \"cachexia,\" have long been prominent as\r\nsignificant of malignant tumors. At the present day this cachexia is\r\nregarded rather as the result than the cause of the tumor, whereas\r\nformerly the reverse was the case.\r\n\r\nThe modern classification of tumors is based chiefly on their\r\nstructure, in part upon their method of origin, and in part upon their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nWith the observation of the similarity of appearances in the flesh of\r\nwhich the external and internal neoplasms are composed, the suggestion\r\nreadily presented itself to regard the external tumors and the\r\ninternal growths as similar in character. External forms, physical\r\ncharacteristics, clinical peculiarities, all proved insufficient as a\r\nmeans of identifying the two, and the step was a short one which led\r\nto the minute study of the flesh of the tumor and a comparison of its\r\nresemblances and differences. This comparison obviously included a\r\nknowledge of the structure and peculiarities of normal tissues. As\r\nhistological studies advanced, so did the pursuit of pathological\r\nhistology, and the tumors which were once designated as encephaloid,\r\nmastoid, pancreatoid, or nephroid, from real {115} or fancied\r\nresemblances to certain organs of the body, became analyzed into their\r\nmicroscopic rather than macroscopic characteristics.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that the modern classification of morbid\r\ngrowths owes its foundation and a large part of its superstructure to\r\nVirchow, whose classic work, _Die Krankhaften Geschwülste_, showed the\r\ndirection which future investigators were to pursue and the nature of\r\nthe discoveries likely to result.\r\n\r\nThe tumor represents the result of the growth of a tissue or tissues\r\nwhich are like or resemble those which form the normal constituents of\r\nthe body. Although a new formation is present, it is composed of\r\ntissues lying within the possibilities of the individual. A new\r\nformation of feathers, as Virchow suggests, is beyond the productive\r\npowers of human tissues, though within those of feathered animals. A\r\ngoose can produce a tumor containing feathers, not one in which hairs\r\nare found; in the human species tumors containing hairs may occur, not\r\nthose, however, in which feathers are present. Although the cells of\r\nthe tumors of man may deviate in their appearances from the cells of\r\nnormal tissues, this deviation is never so extreme that their analogue\r\ncannot be met with in some part of the body.\r\n\r\nAs the normal tissues originate from pre-existing tissues, so the\r\npathological tissues of the tumor grow only from the antecedent\r\ntissues. The matrix from which the tumor arises is a normal tissue.\r\nThere is produced from it, as a neoplasm, either a tissue which\r\nfollows the type of the maternal tissue, a homologous tumor, or one\r\nwhich deviates in type from that of the matrix, a heterologous growth.\r\nAlthough the latter differs in its composition from that of the\r\nmatrix, it does not vary essentially from a like tissue to be found\r\nelsewhere in the body. It occurs where it does not belong either in\r\nplace, time, or quantity. The homologous tumor appears rather as a\r\nhypertrophy of the tissue from which it arises, and the line between\r\nthis variety of growth and a simple hypertrophy is often purely\r\narbitrary.\r\n\r\nAlthough tumors, in the more limited sense, are solid, fleshy masses,\r\nthe new formation of tissues may result in the presence of a tumor\r\nwithin which is a cavity with various contents. Such a cavity is not a\r\nmere hole, but has a distinct wall of connective tissue lined with\r\nepithelium or endothelium. A distinction is thus drawn between cysts\r\nand growths--one which is of daily importance in the practice of\r\nmedicine--and Virchow's oncology includes the consideration of the two\r\nvarieties of tumors.\r\n\r\nCystic tumors are subdivided according to the nature of their contents\r\nand the method of their origin. One group is composed of clotted blood\r\nwithin cavities resulting from the laceration of tissues or in\r\npreformed spaces. If the cyst primarily is merely a rent, the wall\r\nbecomes thickened in time from a growth of the limiting tissues, and\r\nthe blood-clot, of which the tumor was chiefly composed, may remain or\r\nbecome absorbed. If the latter event occurs, its place of deposit may\r\nbecome obliterated by a fusion of the walls of the cyst, or may\r\npersist from the subsequent addition of serum.\r\n\r\nThe cystic tumor whose contents are extravasated blood is the\r\nhæmatoma, familiar instances of which are met with in the hæmatoma of\r\nthe dura mater, of muscle, of the vulva, and the polypoid hæmatoma of\r\n{116} the uterus. The latter is the long retained and constantly\r\nenlarging blood-clot, due to the adherence of portions of the placenta\r\nafter childbirth.\r\n\r\nThe second group of cystic tumors has for its contents a more watery\r\nfluid, and to this the term hygroma is applied. This watery fluid\r\nlies, for the most part, within preformed cavities, and its\r\naccumulation is connected with a dilatation of these cavities.\r\nInstances are met with in the tumors resulting from the accumulation\r\nof fluid in the membranes of the brain or spinal cord, and in the\r\nventricles of the former or in the central canal of the latter. These\r\nlead to the congenital cystic tumors of the cranium or spine, with\r\nwatery contents. The ganglion, the house-maid's knee, as also the\r\nhydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, are regarded as hygromata. The\r\nhydrocele of the neck and elsewhere in the subcutaneous or\r\nintermuscular connective tissue is now removed from the hygromata to\r\nthe tumors which arise from lymph-vessels. A like transfer of other\r\nhygromata might be made in accordance with the prevailing views\r\nconcerning the cavities in which the watery fluid is accumulated.\r\n\r\nA third group of cysts contains material which represents essentially\r\na production from the wall, with a difference of composition dependent\r\nupon the nature of the wall. Such cysts give rise to tumors through\r\nthe retention of their contents, and they are called retention-cysts\r\nor retention-tumors. In the wall of the cysts is a gland-tissue, which\r\nmay line the surface or lie beneath. The glandular structures may be\r\ncutaneous, mucous, or represent a part of the great glands of the\r\nbody, as the liver and kidneys. The atheromatous cyst of the skin, the\r\nmucous cysts of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, and the ovula\r\nNabothi of the uterus are examples of the retention of secretion\r\nwithin glands. The dropsical dilatations of the antrum, the vermiform\r\nappendage, the uterus, the biliary and renal canals furnish instances\r\nof tumors resulting from the retention of secretion on a large scale.\r\nIn the subsequent history of these retention-cysts the secretion may\r\nbe modified chemically and physically; the cells upon the walls may be\r\ntransformed from columnar forms into flattened and scale-like\r\nvarieties. In time, the original secretion frequently becomes a watery\r\nfluid, resembling the contents of the hygroma previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis grouping of cysts in contradistinction to fleshy tumors omits the\r\nconsideration of a series of cystic tumors of enormous size, the\r\nmultilocular tumors of the ovary. This class represents a more complex\r\nform of cystic growth--one whose tendency is toward the reproduction\r\nof cysts, to which the term cystoma is applied. The cystoma is the\r\nresult of an active new formation of epithelium and connective tissue,\r\nand is classified as a variety of the epithelial group of tumors.\r\n\r\nMorbid growths, as distinguished from cysts, are divided by Virchow\r\ninto the simple and complex forms. The former consist of a single\r\ntissue, the histoid tumors; the latter of several tissues suggesting\r\nan organ, the organoid tumors; while still others, in which the number\r\nand grouping of tissues is so complex as to simulate systems of the\r\nbody, even monstrosities, have received the term systematoid or\r\nteratoid tumors.\r\n\r\nVirchow claimed that the growth of most tumors took place from the\r\nconnective tissues, and that most of the organoid tumors, especially\r\ncancer, arose from the formative action of the connective tissue in\r\nthe part where {117} it first made its appearance. The structure of\r\ncancer suggested an organ, as it consisted of collections of cells\r\nresembling epithelium, within spaces or alveoli whose walls were\r\nformed of connective tissue. The epithelioid cells of the cancer, as\r\nwell as the connective-tissue corpuscles, were considered to arise\r\nfrom pre-existing cells of connective tissue.\r\n\r\nThe first, most important, modification of Virchow's views, which has\r\nled to a more rational appreciation of the relation of the various\r\ntumors, especially of the epithelial group, to each other, arose in\r\nconsequence of the investigations of Thiersch and others with regard\r\nto the origin of certain cancers. This observer[83] claimed that the\r\nepithelioid element of cutaneous cancers arose in all instances from\r\npre-existing epithelium, either of the rete mucosum or cutaneous\r\nglands. Similar views were suggested, with various degrees of\r\nprecision, by other authors concerning certain cancerous tumors\r\nelsewhere, but were first applied to all cancers with a more exact\r\nformulation by Waldeyer,[84] to whom the prevailing views with regard\r\nto the histogenesis of morbid growths are due. According to him, the\r\nessential (epithelioid) element of all primitive cancers arises from\r\npre-existing epithelium; consequently, no cancer-cell can arise except\r\nin organs where epithelium is normally present.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Der Epithelial Krebs, namentlich der Haut, etc._,\r\n1865.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1867, xli. 470; 1872, lv. 67;\r\n_Volkmann's Sammlung klinischer Vorträge_, 1871, xxxiii.]\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive statement was rendered possible by the\r\nembryological researches of Remak at the outset, and afterward by\r\nthose of His and Waldeyer. Remak showed that after differentiation of\r\nthe cells of the ovum into the several germinal layers, those from one\r\nlayer could not serve to originate the cells belonging to another\r\nlayer. The development of normal tissues takes place within the limits\r\ndefined by this differentiation. Epithelium thus is not derived from\r\nconnective tissue, nerves, or muscles, nor was the reverse known to\r\noccur. To His is due the exact appreciation of the superficial cells\r\nof serous membranes, which had been previously called epithelium, and\r\nhad thus been confounded with the epithelial cells of mucous or\r\ncutaneous membranes and of secretory glands. He showed that these\r\ncells had a wholly different origin from epithelium, and were simply\r\nscale-like cells of fibrous tissue, to which he applied the name\r\nendothelium. The latter is now used as the term for the thin, squamous\r\ncells of fibrous tissue, whether they are found lining the walls of\r\nthe great serous cavities or the smaller lymph-spaces, the\r\nendocardium, or the inner coat of blood-vessels and lymphatics.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this distinction is obvious when the occurrence of\r\ntumors, called cancers, is observed in parts which contain no\r\nepithelium. Aside from the vagueness of the term cancer, as applied\r\nclinically, tumors are sometimes met with, even in parts where\r\nepithelium normally does not exist, whose structure resembles more or\r\nless closely that of cancer as usually recognized. Such tumors are to\r\nbe regarded as of an endothelial rather than epithelial character, and\r\nas such their histogenesis falls under the general laws of the\r\ndevelopment of tissues.\r\n\r\nWaldeyer[85] has suggested that the primitive basis for the\r\ndevelopment of the genito-urinary tract contains cells which are\r\nequivalent in their possibilities of ultimate development to the\r\nepithelium of the limiting germinal layers--a suggestion which is of\r\nimportance in permitting the {118} epithelial tumors of the ovary to\r\nbe brought under the general embryological laws of development.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _Eierstock und Ei_, 1870.]\r\n\r\nAs the growth of embryonal tissues is so defined that descendants are\r\nlike their ancestors in all respects, so the development of tissues in\r\nthe adult is regarded as defined with equal precision. Eberth and\r\nWadsworth[86] have shown that the regeneration of corneal epithelium\r\ntakes place from pre-existing epithelium. E. Neumann and others claim\r\nin like manner the development of muscular tissue from antecedent\r\nmuscular cells.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1870, li. 361.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of cancer to epithelial tumors is regarded as similar to\r\nthat borne by sarcoma to tumors composed of connective tissues. The\r\ngrowth of the epithelial elements into the neighboring parts is\r\nthrough paths determined by pre-existing or new-formed connective\r\ntissue. The active element of the cancer lies more especially in its\r\nepithelioid cells, and its growth takes place in an atypical rather\r\nthan a typical manner. Of the various epithelial tumors, there are\r\nthose like the cutaneous horn or corn, the adenoma or cystoma, whose\r\nepithelial growth takes place in accordance with normal methods of\r\nproduction. The epithelioid constituent of the cancer, on the\r\ncontrary, grows often with great luxuriance and with but little\r\ntendency to carry out the normal mutual relations of the epithelium\r\nand connective tissue of the part from which it proceeds. The\r\nepithelioid masses or sprouts are composed of cells whose relation to\r\neach other resembles that of normal epithelium in the absence of an\r\nintercellular substance, while the shapes of the cells correspond more\r\nor less closely with that of the epithelium in the region from which\r\nthe tumor arises. The epithelioid cells of cutaneous cancers resemble\r\nthose of the surface, the rete, or the glands of the skin. Cancers of\r\nthe stomach or uterus contain epithelioid cells whose shape simulates\r\nthe varieties in the stomach and uterus. Such resemblances are carried\r\nout in the degenerations which the cells of cancer undergo. The\r\nhorn-like, keratoid, transformation of epidermoid cells in cutaneous\r\ncancers, the mucous degeneration of the epithelioid cells of cancers\r\nof mucous membranes, are sufficiently familiar. Notwithstanding these\r\nresemblances, which are also present in secondary tumors at remote\r\nparts of the body, the epithelioid growth advances without limit and\r\nwithout reproducing the normal type. Cancer is therefore defined as an\r\natypical, epithelial new formation.\r\n\r\nSarcoma, on the other hand, whose clinical features correspond so\r\nclosely with those of cancer, simulates, as shown by Virchow, the\r\nconnective tissues. It is composed of cells and intercellular\r\nsubstance, both of which may be as varied as are those of the\r\nconnective tissues. The shape of the cells is as diverse and their\r\ncontents as various, while their possibilities of degeneration are\r\nalike. The cells of the sarcoma are not simply cemented together, as\r\nare epithelial cells, but they are separated from each other by an\r\nintercellular substance, which corresponds in its appearance and\r\nchemical properties with that of mucous, fibrous, cartilaginous, or\r\nosseous tissue. The structure of the sarcoma differs from that of\r\nthese tissues in presenting a predominance of cells over intercellular\r\nsubstance, while the reverse is the characteristic of most varieties\r\nof connective tissue. In this predominant cell-formation lies its\r\nabsence of type, {119} whereas the atypical character of the cancerous\r\ngrowth is manifested rather by the irregular grouping of the cellular\r\nmasses than by an abundance of cells.\r\n\r\nAs the original cancer is considered as possible only in parts where\r\nepithelium is a normal constituent, so the primitive sarcoma is\r\npossible only in parts where connective tissue is present. The\r\napparent great frequency of sarcoma in recent times is thus obviously\r\nexplained. With an agreement as to its histological characteristics,\r\nits possible place of origin is any of the connective tissues of the\r\nbody, and their presence is universal. In the manner of its growth,\r\nits recurrence, and generalization it is subject to the same laws\r\nwhich determine similar events in the history of cancer. Its\r\ndegenerations are often the same, and its symptoms are due to the\r\naction of like causes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of distinguishing between these atypical tumors is\r\nreal, in that it is only through the association of causes, symptoms,\r\nand results with defined and constant characteristics that a practical\r\nknowledge of tumors is to arise. The time-honored distinction between\r\nmalignant or semi-malignant and benignant growths is always to be\r\nsought for, and can only be fully possessed when the natural history\r\nof the new formations is known. With an exact appreciation of the\r\nstructure of a tumor it becomes possible to study its special\r\npathology. From a knowledge of the latter are to be derived those\r\nfeatures of importance in determining the relation of morbid growths\r\nto other deviations from normal and physiological processes. An\r\nimmediately practical benefit arises from the Thiersch-Waldeyer\r\nmodification of Virchow's theory of the origin of tumors, in that it\r\npermits with greater ease a more accurate clinical diagnosis.\r\nLücke[87] has been prominent in calling attention to the suggestions\r\nthus presented.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Volkmann's Sammlung klinischer Vorträge_, 1876, xcvii.]\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic value of the theory above-mentioned is rather negative\r\nthan positive. With rare exceptions, a tumor cannot be epithelial in\r\ncharacter if its origin is from an organ or a part in which epithelium\r\nis absent. The possible exceptions admit theoretical explanations\r\nwhich present considerable degrees of probability, and are also based\r\nupon the existing views of the development of tissues.\r\n\r\nA tumor whose origin from the connective tissues is determined\r\npartakes of the characteristics of its matrix, and is a\r\nconnective-tissue tumor. Its development from fibrous tissue is more\r\nlikely to result in a fibroma; from fat tissue, a lipoma, or a myxoma;\r\nfrom cartilage or bone, a chondroma or osteoma.\r\n\r\nTumors developing at certain periods of life in certain parts of the\r\nbody are more likely to belong to one than another of the histogenetic\r\ngroups. Tumors of the connective-tissue series are stated by Lücke as\r\nmore prevalent before the age of thirty-five years, while those of the\r\nepithelial group are more likely to occur after this age, and cancer\r\nof the lip is of special frequency in old age. The fibro-myoma is of\r\nmost frequent occurrence in the uterus, and rarely attains a large\r\nsize till the approach of the climacteric.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of growth of tumors is also associated with their\r\ngenesis. It has previously been stated that the more rapidly growing\r\ntumors are those whose cells are most abundant and in the closest and\r\nmost {120} intimate relation to blood-vessels. The type of such tumors\r\nis the sarcoma with its scanty intercellular substance, while the\r\nother (histoid) tumors in the same series, as the fibroma, lipoma,\r\nchondroma, etc., are of relatively slow growth. Tumors of the\r\nepithelial series are of slow growth, from the constantly increasing\r\ndistance of the new-formed cells from the vascular connective tissue\r\nwhich provides their nourishment. When, however, the growth of the\r\nepithelium advances into the connective tissue, pushing out in all\r\ndirections and coming in contact with new series of vessels, the\r\nopportunities for nutrition are favorable. In like manner, when the\r\nnew formation concerns the connective-tissue stroma, as well as the\r\nepithelial sprouts, vascularization proceeds with the development of\r\nthe tumor, and favorable conditions for rapid growth are presented.\r\nLarge epithelial tumors may thus arise within organs, but, as the\r\nsurfaces are reached, the sources of nourishment become farther\r\nremoved and the degeneration of the epithelium favors its detachment\r\nand the formation of ulcers. Hence the tumors whose advance is\r\nassociated with ulceration belong rather to the epithelial than the\r\nconnective-tissue group.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the cancerous tumors to become generalized through the\r\nlymphatics, and that of sarcomatous growths through the blood-vessels,\r\nis admitted as an important feature in the differential diagnosis.\r\nAlthough there are numerous exceptions, the rule is available. Its\r\nexplanation is based upon the assumed inability of the larger\r\nepithelial cells of the cancer to pass through the lymph-glands; being\r\ndetained, they serve as new centres of growth. The smaller cells of\r\nthe sarcoma, on the contrary, are permitted a passage through the\r\ngland. The numerous and thin walled blood-vessels present in the\r\nrapidly growing sarcoma permit an extension of the latter into their\r\ninterior, and thus a ready opportunity is offered for the formation of\r\nemboli.\r\n\r\nAnother important modification in the classification of tumors has\r\nresulted from the recent discoveries regarding the nature and effects\r\nof infective agencies. Virchow grouped together under the term\r\ngranulomata certain growths composed of granulation-tissue occurring\r\nin syphilis, lupus, leprosy, and glanders. Their relation to\r\ninflammatory processes was very intimate, yet they were recognizable\r\nas tumors from their possession of many of the characteristics\r\ngenerally admitted as belonging to such morbid growths. Although at\r\ntimes their presence might be regarded as evidence of an inflammatory\r\ndisturbance, their frequent appearance independently of general\r\nsymptoms of the latter was apparent. These tumors, furthermore, were\r\nso frequently accompanied by inflammatory products as to suggest a\r\nlike cause for both. Virchow stated that the recognition of the\r\netiology of these tumors was indispensable to their separate\r\nconsideration, and laid stress upon the presence of a specific virus,\r\ncontagious and infectious, in the case of syphilis. His views\r\nconcerning the etiology of leprosy, though more guarded, yet carried\r\nthe suggestion of the importance of exact investigation concerning the\r\nassumed contagious character of this disease. The contagiousness of\r\nglanders was not only admitted, but the similarity of its manner of\r\norigin and propagation to the invasion of syphilis was also stated.\r\nNot only were the resemblances between glanders and syphilis\r\nrecognized, but lupus, leprosy, tubercle, and scrofula were also\r\nadmitted as presenting a similar relation.\r\n\r\n{121} The importance of recognizing the etiology of these tumors\r\nrather than their anatomy as a basis of classification was strongly\r\nurged by Klebs,[88] who proposed the term infective tumors for the\r\ngroup of granulomata, including syphilis, lupus, leprosy, and\r\nglanders; and for tubercle, scrofula and the pearly distemper of\r\nanimals, which Virchow had classified as lymphomata. This group has\r\nbeen still further extended by the addition of the lymphomata\r\noccurring in typhoid fever, scarlet fever, and diphtheria. Ponfick[89]\r\nhas recently added the disease actinomycosis to the series, and\r\nCohnheim suggests that certain of the lympho-sarcomata may be\r\nsimilarly classified.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, 1875, cxxvi. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Die Actinomykose des Menschen_, 1882.]\r\n\r\nThe growths thus included have a common element of structure--the\r\ngranulation-tissue, with its possible disappearance through absorption\r\nor its transformation into an abscess or dense fibrous tissue. Such\r\nfeatures are those common to the granulation-tissue resulting from\r\nordinary inflammation. Their essential characteristic, however, lies\r\nin the etiology of this granulation-tissue, and for many members of\r\nthe group the cause has been discovered to be microscopic organisms.\r\nThe constant presence of these is determined in sufficient numbers, in\r\nsuch distribution, and in such relation, as to explain the nature and\r\noccurrence of the tumors.\r\n\r\nThe evidence recorded is not equally full and exact for all members of\r\nthis group. Neisser[90] has discovered the bacillus of leprosy, and\r\nthe discovery by Koch[91] of the bacillus of tuberculosis, scrofula,\r\nand pearly distemper has already been referred to. Schütz and\r\nLöffler[92] have lately announced their isolation of the\r\nmicro-organism causing glanders, and Bollinger[93] discovered the\r\nfungus whose presence is necessary for the existence of actinomycosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1881, lxxxiv. 514.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: See page 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Deutsche medicinische Wochenschrift_, 1882, lii. 707.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Centralblatt für die med. Wissenschaften_, 1877,\r\nxxvii.]\r\n\r\nIn the above affections the organisms are to be regarded as the\r\ncharacteristic active agent in producing the phenomena of the disease\r\nin which they occur. The presence of micro-organisms in syphilis,\r\ntyphoid fever, scarlet fever, and diphtheria is admitted, yet their\r\nabsolute identification and constant presence as a cause of the\r\nvarious manifestations of the respective diseases still remains to be\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nThe classification of tumors herewith presented is essentially that of\r\nVirchow, with such extensions and modifications as have arisen in\r\nconsequence of the investigations and discoveries during the twenty\r\nyears which have elapsed since the delivery of his memorable series of\r\nlectures. Cysts are mentioned, as well as growths, from the importance\r\nof the former in practical medicine. The frequent simultaneous\r\noccurrence of cysts and growths in the same tumor should be mentioned,\r\nand the cystic feature is usually indicated as a qualification.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYSTS.\r\n\r\nCavities, either new formed or pre-existing, with various contents.\r\nThe latter are blood, liquid other than blood, and gland-secretion or\r\nretained secretion. The wall varies in structure in accordance with\r\nthe method of origin of the cavity.\r\n\r\n{122} _Hæmatoma._\r\n\r\nA collection of extravasated blood, usually within the tissues.\r\nExamples, hæmatoma of the pericranium (periosteum), of the external\r\near, muscle, dura mater, ovary, broad ligament, vulva, anus, uterus\r\n(from retained placenta), hæmatocele, dissecting aneurism.\r\n\r\n_Hygroma._\r\n\r\nA collection of transuded or exuded fluid in pre-existing or\r\nnew-formed spaces. Examples, hydrocele, hydromeningocele,\r\nhydromyelocele, hydrencephalocele, ganglion, inflamed bursa.\r\n\r\n_Retention-Cyst._\r\n\r\nAn accumulation of retained secretion in follicles or canals from\r\nobstruction to its escape. Examples, atheroma and comedo of the skin,\r\nmucous cysts of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, ovula Nabothi,\r\nand cystic polypus of the uterus; retention-cyst of the antrum,\r\nvermiform appendage, gall-bladder, and bile-ducts; dropsical\r\ndilatation of the ovarian follicles, Fallopian tube, uterus\r\n(hydrometra), parovarium (cyst of the broad ligament); hydronephrosis\r\nand multilocular cystic kidney, spermatocele, ranula, galactocele.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe growths are classified according to the tissues of which they are\r\nchiefly composed and from which they originate, and according to their\r\netiology. There are consequently the connective-tissue group; that of\r\ntissues of higher function, as muscle, nerve, and vessels; and the\r\nepithelial group, in which the new formation of epithelium is the\r\nessential feature. The teratoid group comprises a more complex massing\r\nof tissues, representing a combination of those derived from all the\r\ngerminal layers of the embryo. The infective group includes those\r\ntumors whose structure is closely allied to that of the products of\r\ninflammation, but whose origin is the direct result of the\r\nintroduction from without of a microphyte.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTIVE-TISSUE GROUP.\r\n\r\nEach member mainly composed of a more or less typical growth of a\r\nconnective tissue:\r\n\r\n  Myxoma,\r\n  Lipoma,\r\n  Glioma,\r\n  Chondroma,\r\n  Fibroma (including papilloma and melanoma),\r\n  Osteoma.\r\n\r\nTo these are added tumors composed of an atypical growth of a\r\nconnective tissue, chiefly manifested by a predominance of cells:\r\n\r\n  Endothelioma,\r\n  Sarcoma.\r\n\r\nThe sarcoma includes as many varieties as there are tissues in this\r\ngroup, hence,\r\n\r\n  Myxosarcoma,\r\n  Liposarcoma,\r\n  Gliosarcoma,\r\n  Chondrosarcoma,\r\n  Fibrosarcoma, melanosarcoma,\r\n  Osteosarcoma.\r\n\r\n\r\n{123} GROUP OF TISSUES OF HIGHER FUNCTION.\r\n\r\n  Myoma, of striped (rhabdomyoma) and smooth (leiomyoma) muscular\r\n    tissue,\r\n  Neuroma, of nerve tissue,\r\n  Angioma, of blood-vessels,\r\n  Lymphangioma, of lymphatics,\r\n  Lymphoma (?), of lymph-gland tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITHELIAL GROUP.\r\n\r\nEpidermis:\r\n\r\n  Callus,\r\n  Corn,\r\n  Keratosis,\r\n  Horn,\r\n  Onychoma.\r\n\r\nEpithelium of mucous membranes or glands:\r\n\r\n  Struma (?),\r\n  Adenoma,\r\n  Cystoma.\r\n\r\nIn the above varieties the growth of epithelium is more or less\r\ntypical, a simple hyperplasia, either alone or combined with the new\r\nformation of fibrous tissue. Only the last three members of the series\r\nare tumors in the limited sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCER.\r\n\r\nCancer remains as an epithelial tumor, representing the atypical\r\ngrowth of cells resembling epidermis or the epithelium of glands and\r\nmucous membranes, extending into parts where epithelium is not found\r\nas a normal constituent. A new formation of connective tissue is\r\nusually associated with that of the epithelial cells.\r\n\r\nNumerous varieties of cancer are described, according to the physical\r\nand structural peculiarities of the tumor. The scirrhus and\r\nencephaloid of the earlier writers are now transformed into fibrous\r\nand medullary cancer. This change in name is due to the stress laid\r\nupon the predominance of the fibrous stroma as the usual cause for the\r\nhard, dense, scirrhous cancer, while an abundance of epithelioid cells\r\nin relatively large alveoli is present in the encephaloid,\r\nmarrow-like, medullary variety.\r\n\r\nWhen the growth takes place from the skin or mucous membranes, the\r\nsurface frequently presents numerous and usually arborescent papillæ\r\nor villi. The papillary cancers of the skin and the villous cancers of\r\nmucous membranes are thus distinguished.\r\n\r\nCancerous growths of the skin and transitional membranes, often called\r\nepithelioma or cancroid, usually contain epithelioid cells resembling\r\nepidermis, and are therefore designated as epidermoid or\r\npavement-celled cancer. The alveolar contents of certain cutaneous\r\ncancers are cells resembling those of the deeper layers of the rete\r\nmucosum, while those of other cancers of the skin resemble rather the\r\nepithelium of sweat-glands. Growths of the former character extend\r\nlaterally, ulcerate early, and are known as superficial cutaneous\r\ncancer. They form one of the varieties of the so-called rodent ulcer.\r\nCutaneous cancers, simulating in their structure a reproduction of the\r\nepithelium of sweat-glands, represent a variety of glandular cancer.\r\nThe latter term is applied to cancerous growths which arise in\r\nglandular organs, with suggested resemblances of their cells to the\r\ngland-cells of the respective organ. {124} Cylindrical-celled cancer\r\nis frequently met with in those parts of which a cylindrical\r\nepithelium is a normal constituent.\r\n\r\nThe degenerations of the epithelioid cells and stroma suggest\r\nqualifying terms. The mucous and colloid cancers are those whose\r\nalveolar contents or stroma have undergone a mucous or colloid\r\ndegeneration. The keratoid cancer is one which presents the horn-like\r\ntransformation of its epidermoid cells. The melanotic cancer contains\r\nabundant pigment, melanin, within its cells.\r\n\r\nThese differences in the structure and appearance of the tumor are\r\nfrequently associated with certain modifications of growth and\r\nclinical properties. The epidermoid cancers are less likely to recur\r\nafter early removal; the medullary cancers are of rapid growth and\r\nprone to ulceration; while the fibrous or scirrhous forms are of\r\nextreme slowness of growth. In general, however, the pathological\r\nimportance of cancerous tumors is essentially the same wherever the\r\nseat and whatever the peculiarities of structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERATOID GROUP.\r\n\r\nIncludes those tumors, usually of congenital origin and apparent at\r\nbirth, composed of connective tissue, epithelium, nerves, muscle, and\r\nvessels. These tissues are often so grouped together as to suggest\r\nsystems of the body and parts of an individual. Cysts are often\r\npresent which simulate cavities found in the body, whether of normal\r\nor pathological origin.\r\n\r\nIn this group are the dermoid cysts with their various contents,\r\nepidermis, sebum, hair, teeth, and bone. The solid teratomata, with\r\nall varieties of connective tissue, as fibrous tissue, fat tissue,\r\ncartilage, bone, neuroglia, in addition to nerves, muscle, and\r\nvessels. Squamous, cylindrical, and ciliated epithelium may be present\r\nand line cavities, at times tubular, whose walls are formed of skin or\r\nmucous membrane. Other tumors of this group are commonly included\r\nunder monstrosities, and comprise the varieties of duplication of\r\nparts of the body, of which the extreme instances are such double\r\nmonstrosities as the Siamese Twins, Ritta and Christina, the Spanish\r\nCavalier, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIVE GROUP.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic is the cause, micro-organisms, which,\r\nintroduced into the body, produce, through their dissemination and\r\ndevelopment, multiple growths of tissue like those resulting from\r\npersistent inflammation. As their structure corresponds with the\r\nproductive results of inflammation, and their cause is analogous to\r\nthe infective causes of inflammation, these morbid growths are closely\r\nallied to inflammatory disturbances. Their classification among tumors\r\nis desirable, as they represent circumscribed growths whose\r\nappearance, persistence, and effects closely resemble those\r\ncharacteristics of the morbid growths, in the limited sense, in which\r\nthe new formation of tissue occupies a wider range:\r\n\r\n  _Granuloma_ of tuberculosis, scrofula, leprosy, glanders,\r\n    actinomycosis, syphilis, lupus.\r\n  _Lymphoma_ of diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{125}\r\n\r\nGENERAL ETIOLOGY, MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS, AND PROGNOSIS.\r\n\r\nBY HENRY HARTSHORNE, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nRecognizing pathology as simply morbid physiology--that is, the study\r\nof the body and its functions in states of disorder from morbid\r\nconditions--how these morbid conditions are produced is the complex\r\nquestion to be answered by Etiology.\r\n\r\nNor is this question (or series of questions) by any means only of\r\nspeculative or theoretical importance. It is, indeed, eminently\r\npractical. What a difference, for example, there must be in the\r\ndiagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of an attack of inflammation of\r\nthe eye, in accordance with its causation by ordinary conditional\r\ninfluences (taking cold), by a particle of steel imbedded in the\r\ncornea, or by syphilis! How great the difference between the wound\r\nmade by the teeth of an animal, in one case with, and in another\r\nwithout, the presence of rabies in its system! Take the instance of\r\nwhat we call fever: at a certain stage it is almost the same in half a\r\ndozen diseases. By the causation, when known, of this common congeries\r\nof symptoms we judge of the essential nature of the malady, and so of\r\nits proper treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim in philosophy that every event or effect must have at\r\nleast two causes. In medical etiology we often find many causes\r\nconspiring to produce one effect. These may be, and commonly have\r\nbeen, grouped together under two heads; as, 1, predisposing, and 2,\r\nexciting, causes. But under each of these may come a number of\r\nagencies contributing toward the production or modification of\r\ndisease. Thus, of predisposing causes we may enumerate inherited\r\nconstitution, habits of life, previous attacks of disease, atmosphere,\r\nand other immediate surroundings. Exciting causes--say, of an attack\r\nof apoplexy--may be, in the same case, mental shock, a stooping\r\nposture, an over-heated room, etc. One disease is very often the next\r\npreceding cause of another. So we speak of the great class of sequelæ\r\nof acute or subacute disorders; as, ophthalmia after measles, deafness\r\nfollowing scarlet fever, or blindness small-pox, abscesses following\r\ntyphoid fever, paralysis diphtheria, etc. But this kind of causation\r\nis extremely common also in chronic affections. What a train of\r\norganic troubles, of kidneys, heart, arteries, brain, and other parts,\r\nattend the affection to which we give the name of Bright's disease!\r\nHow complex the sequence often of valvular disease of the heart,\r\nitself in many instances the effect of rheumatic fever, with {126}\r\nendocarditis as a local manifestation of that disorder! Hardly any\r\ndiscovery in pathology (or pathogeny, the generation of diseases) of\r\nthe last half century has been more remarkable and fruitful than that\r\nof thrombosis and embolism, with their serious and not rarely fatal\r\nconsequences, through obstruction of the blood-supply to different\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nPrevious diseases constitute an often overlooked class of factors in\r\npredisposing to new attacks, and also in determining their course and\r\nresults. Of some affections one attack prepares the way for another,\r\nas is the case with intermittent fever, convulsions, delirium tremens,\r\nand insanity. Just the reverse is true of yellow fever and of all the\r\nexanthemata, as scarlet fever, measles, small-pox; likewise of the\r\nanalogous disorders, mumps and whooping cough. The moot question in\r\nthis regard concerning syphilis may be left for discussion elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOur classification of the causes of disease may be set forth in simple\r\nform, thus:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-natal causation--viz. hereditary transmission of a proclivity\r\nto certain disorders, and also the influence of circumstances acting\r\non either parent at the time of conception or on the mother during\r\ngestation.\r\n\r\n2. Conditional causation--_i.e._ that belonging to variations of\r\ntemperature, humidity, etc., affecting individuals.\r\n\r\n3. Functional causation--that which is connected with excessive,\r\ndeficient, or abnormal exercise of any of the functions of the\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n4. Ingestive causation--_e.g._ bad diet, intemperance, poisoning.\r\n\r\n5. Enthetic causation--viz. that of all contagious, endemic, and\r\nepidemic diseases. Closely allied to this is epithelic morbid\r\ninfluence--namely, that of the parasites producing certain affections\r\nof the skin, as itch, favus, etc.\r\n\r\n6. Mechanical causation. The effects of this belong chiefly, though\r\nnot exclusively, to the domain of surgery.\r\n\r\nPre-natal causation is of immense consequence, and its study takes in\r\nthe whole scope of the influences of species, race, family, and\r\nindividual parentage. Darwin's observations and speculations, and\r\nthose of other evolutionists, have not ignored the field of human life\r\nin considering the struggle for existence and the survival of the\r\nfittest. If we are obliged to admit that such a struggle and survival\r\ndo exist for men as well as for animals and for plants, it is\r\nnevertheless obvious that either man's reason and will introduce\r\nexceptions to the ordinary laws of development and selection in\r\nnature, or else a very peculiar standard of fitness must be recognized\r\nin the survivals of humanity. Many feeble, inert, deformed, and\r\ndiseased forms survive and perpetuate offspring through a long series\r\nof generations, while strong and admirable ones perish, often even\r\ndestroying each other.\r\n\r\nLeaving this theme, upon which biological science has not yet\r\npronounced its last word, we may inquire, What diseases are reasonably\r\nascribed to hereditary transmission? First, it must be remarked that\r\nseldom is a disease actually received directly from a parent. Putting\r\naside a few asserted instances of variola and allied or analogous\r\naffections in utero, congenital constitutional syphilis and (more\r\nrarely) scrofulosis seem to afford almost the only examples of this.\r\nNearly always it is a predisposition merely that is inherited. This,\r\nhowever, may be very strongly marked. Its seat is evidently in that\r\n(as yet) occult law or {127} process of individual organic development\r\nto whose manifestation we give the name of the constitution. In some\r\nfamilies all the men grow bald before forty; in others, scarcely so at\r\neighty. Some may expect deafness in middle life, others blindness in\r\nold age, and others, again, have a probability of death from disease\r\nof the heart at about fifty or apoplexy at about sixty years of age.\r\nSuch considerations enter into every examination for life insurance,\r\nand they are no less important in our prognostications of the results\r\nof diseases in practice.\r\n\r\nSpeaking more definitely, gout is undoubtedly often hereditary. That\r\nis, a healthy childhood may be followed by liability to gout in adult\r\nor middle age, even in the absence of direct provocatives to that\r\ndisorder, but much more frequently when they are present. Gout affords\r\nan example of the general fact that inherited proclivity to special\r\ndiseases shows itself at nearly the same time of life in each\r\ngeneration--scrofula in childhood, phthisis in adolescence or early\r\nmaturity, gout from thirty to forty, apoplexy after sixty, etc. But\r\nexceptions to such rules are not at all rare. Gout also exemplifies\r\nanother important fact--viz. the occasional modification of the\r\ntransmitted morbid tendency or \"diathesis.\" Parents who have regular\r\ngout--_i.e._ painful attacks of acute inflammation of the smaller\r\njoints, followed by deposits of urates, carbonates, etc.--not\r\nunfrequently have children who are subject to neuralgia or dyspepsia\r\nor modified rheumatic attacks (not sufficiently recognized in\r\npractical treatises), to which the name \"gouty rheumatism\" is most\r\napplicable. Again, in one generation there may be a marked tendency to\r\ninsanity; in the next, to paralysis; in a third, to tubercular\r\nmeningitis during infancy.[1] Or some of these successions may occur\r\nin a reverse order.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For example, in one family known to me the grandmother\r\nhad paralysis, the mother died insane, and her three children all died\r\nof tubercular meningitis.]\r\n\r\nConstitutional syphilis is undoubtedly often conveyed by inheritance\r\nfrom either parent. Sometimes the impression of this diathesis is so\r\nintense as to devitalize the foetus in utero, causing still-birth. Or\r\nthe manifestations of the disease occur early in infancy, with\r\nsymptoms like those of the secondary or tertiary affection in the\r\noriginal subject of it. Not often, indeed, is the exhibition, in some\r\nmanner, of inherited constitutional syphilis delayed beyond the time\r\nof childhood.\r\n\r\nScrofulosis is well known to follow in the same family through\r\nsuccessive generations, in a manner apparently demonstrative of\r\nhereditary derivation. It is true that here we have a problem not\r\nwithout complication. Certain circumstances, as poverty of living,\r\ndampness of locality, want of fresh air in houses, etc., promote\r\nscrofula in children. Now, are we sure that it is from its parents\r\nthat each child, exposed to these morbific surroundings, has obtained\r\nits disposition to strumous disorders? or may it not be that every\r\ntime the diathesis is thus originated de novo? It is to be answered\r\nthat decisive evidence in favor of inheritance is present in a number\r\nof cases where the affection occurs so early in infancy as to be\r\nalmost or quite congenital in its beginnings; and in other instances\r\nwhere removal of the parents into improved localities, and with better\r\nliving altogether, has not prevented the manifestation of the same\r\ntendency in their offspring for two or three generations. The inquiry\r\ndoes not differ very greatly in its nature from that concerning cases\r\nof enthetic diseases--_e.g._ cholera, yellow fever, typhoid fever; as\r\nto which the {128} succession of cases may be such as to allow\r\nhypothetical explanation, either by transmission from one individual\r\nto another or by the subjection of all to a common local infection or\r\nepidemic influence. But in both sorts of cases crucial instances may,\r\nwith care, be found which determine at least the general etiological\r\nlaw for each malady.\r\n\r\nPulmonary phthisis has been always considered to be, in a marked\r\ndegree, a hereditary disease, until, latterly, the hypothesis of a\r\ntubercular virus has threatened to displace old views about it. If,\r\nhowever, we accept the classification of cases of pulmonary\r\nconsumption approved by several leading pathologists, in which a\r\nposition is provided for non-tubercular phthisis, we may at least\r\nplace hereditary vulnerability, or proclivity to consumption, in this\r\ncategory, while awaiting the final decision of science upon the real\r\nnature and origin of tubercle. My own conviction continues to be\r\npositive, that tubercular phthisis is often transmitted by\r\ninheritance, in the same sense as other diseases are generally\r\nso--namely, by the bestowal upon offspring of a constitution\r\nespecially liable to the occurrence of the disorder at the time of\r\nlife when it is generally most apt to appear. The investigations of\r\nVillemin, Cohnheim, Schüller, Koch, Baumgarten, and others have given\r\n(1882) much prominence to the idea of the possibility of the\r\ntransplantation of tubercle from one human or animal body to another.\r\nKoch's elaborate experiments especially are asserted to have shown the\r\nexistence of a bacillus tuberculosis, a true, minute vegetative\r\norganism, which can be cultivated outside of the body, in a suitable\r\nmaterial, at a temperature like that of living blood, and which, when\r\ninoculated, produces tubercular disease. The discussion of this\r\nsubject will occur on a later page as a part of the general topic of\r\nthe causation of enthetic diseases.\r\n\r\nRickets occupies a much less prominent place in the experience of\r\nAmerican practitioners than in that of some countries abroad, and it\r\nis therefore less easy here to obtain materials for the study of its\r\netiology. Among those who have had large opportunities for its\r\nobservation, opinion is divided very much in the manner above referred\r\nto. Thus, Wiltshire and Herring assert it to be certainly hereditary;\r\nJenner denies this altogether, while Aitken adopts the ground that\r\npredisposing causes are derived from the parents or the nurse, which\r\nare so capable of influencing the health of the child as to lead in\r\ncourse of time to the establishment of the disease.\r\n\r\nGoitre is manifestly a family disorder to a large extent in certain\r\nregions, most familiarly in Alpine valleys in Switzerland. But this\r\nlocal feature takes us back to the same kind of question: Is it the\r\ntransmission of a specially modified constitution from parents, or the\r\ndirect action of morbid local influences on the children themselves,\r\nthat produces bronchocele and its frequent attendant, cretinism?\r\nUndoubtedly, goitre often occurs in children of healthy parents\r\nbrought from another locality into one where the disease is common;\r\nand, per contra, goitrous subjects not infrequently recover from the\r\naffection when removed for a length of time from the place where it\r\nwas developed in them. We are, apparently, at least safe in taking\r\nhere a position like that of Aitken concerning rickets: viz. that\r\npredisposing causes are derived from parentage, whereby, more easily\r\nthan in those of different descent, certain influences will develop\r\ngoitre or cretinism, or both together.\r\n\r\n{129} As to leprosy, there seems no more room for doubt that it is\r\noften--nay, generally--hereditary. The obscurity attending its\r\nhistory, however (more than one cutaneous affection having been from\r\ntime to time classed under the same name), will justify our referring\r\nthe reader for the particular discussion of its etiology to another\r\npart of this work. (See DISEASES OF THE CUTANEOUS SYSTEM.)\r\n\r\nHæmophilia is clearly hereditary in certain families. Immermann\r\nasserts it to be even a race-liability in the Jews. \"Bleeders\" upon\r\noccasion of very small wounds of the skin, gums, etc. have been known\r\nin several successive generations, including (Börner; Kehrer) women at\r\nthe time of parturition, who then are apt to have dangerous\r\nhemorrhages.\r\n\r\nCancer presents as unmistakable examples of inheritance as any other\r\ndisease. Paget asserts this to be traceable in one case out of three;\r\nSibley, in one of nine; and Bryant, one of ten cases. De Morgan and\r\nothers have shown the same thing to be true of non-malignant morbid\r\ngrowths. But, as Paget has remarked, when other local disease or\r\ndeformity is inherited, it usually involves in the offspring the same\r\ntissue, often the same part of the body, as in the parent, but the\r\ntransmitted cancerous tendency may show itself anywhere: \"Cancer of\r\nthe breast in the parent is marked as cancer of the lip in the\r\noffspring. The cancer of the cheek in the parent becomes cancer of the\r\nbone in the child. There is in these cases absolutely no relation at\r\nall of place or texture.\"\r\n\r\nCataract is believed by good authorities to be promoted by hereditary\r\ntendency. It is of the nature of a degeneration. Possibly, in a\r\ngreatly-prolonged decay of all the organs with age, all eyes tend to\r\nbecome cataractous from structural alteration of the crystalline lens.\r\nUnder observation a quite different rate of degenerative change takes\r\nplace among the organs of the body in different individuals and\r\nfamilies. Thus, the lens becomes opaque in some at an age when the\r\nhearing continues good and the muscles retain considerable vigor,\r\nwhile in members of other families the eyes remain in a sound\r\ncondition at a time when other organs and powers have failed.\r\nCongenital cataract appears to be altogether independent of any\r\nproclivity transmitted from parents in the nature of an inheritance.\r\n\r\nAffections of the nervous system very often show hereditary descent.\r\nNeuralgia prevails strongly in certain families. Particularly, that\r\nform of cephalalgia called sick headache is apt to appear, in the\r\nperiodical form, through several generations. Apoplexy and paralysis\r\nare prone to occur at nearly the same time of life under the\r\ntransmission of like constitutions by parentage. Still more often this\r\nhas been observed of epilepsy and hysteria, and, most of all the\r\nneuroses, in insanity. Monomania and melancholia have been in a great\r\nnumber of instances traced to generative succession--sometimes,\r\nespecially suicidal monomania, through four or five generations.\r\nPredisposition to intemperance, methomania, is also a terrible\r\ninheritance in some families. Although the production of this malady\r\nrequires the provocative of indulgence in the use of alcohol for its\r\ndevelopment, yet the facility with which this result occurs under the\r\nsame circumstances in different families is too marked to leave room\r\nfor doubt of its hereditary nature.\r\n\r\nLess certainly, but with much probability, we may assign parental\r\nendowment as one of the factors in the causation of organic disease of\r\n{130} the heart, arteries, liver, and kidneys, as well as of angina\r\npectoris, asthma, croup, dyspepsia, and hemorrhoids.\r\n\r\nIs a special proclivity to any of the group of enthetic febrile\r\ndiseases ever inherited? Dr. George B. Wood believed this to be the\r\ncase with enteric or typhoid fever. Few others have shared this\r\nopinion, but it is not impossible that it has a basis of truth.\r\n\r\nReference has been made already to the difference between periodical\r\nmalarial fevers (intermittent, etc.) and yellow fever, in that an\r\nattack of the latter does, and one of the former does not, protect the\r\nindividual, usually, from liability to the disease on exposure to its\r\ncause. Does this protection extend to offspring of parents who have\r\nbeen \"acclimatized\" to yellow fever? Facts on this point are not easy\r\nto obtain. While, however, there appears to be no proof that a single\r\ngeneration can ever suffice to outgrow (so to speak) liability to this\r\ndisease, it is well known that creoles in Louisiana and the West\r\nIndies are less susceptible to it than recent white residents, and\r\nthat the negroes are much less so, as a race, than the whites.\r\nFurthermore, negroes whose ancestors have long been domesticated in\r\nour Southern States appear to re-acquire susceptibility to yellow\r\nfever in a degree more nearly like that of white people than is\r\nobserved in natives of Western Africa imported within one or two\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAs to autumnal malarial fevers (remittent, intermittent), the black\r\nrace exhibits a sort of race-acclimatization, giving negroes, both in\r\nAfrica and in America, a much less degree of liability than is common\r\nto all races of European descent.\r\n\r\nHow far any similar modification may occur in the course of\r\ngenerations in regard to susceptibility to small-pox and allied\r\ndiseases remains at present a matter of speculation. Some authors\r\ninsist that there must be at least a kind of natural selection,\r\naccording to which a great epidemic of variola, destroying the lives\r\nof many of those most predisposed to suffer from it, will leave the\r\nremaining population less likely to be attacked by it. The endeavor\r\nhas even been made to explain away in this manner much of the\r\ndiminution of mortality from small-pox commonly credited to\r\nvaccination. But the statistics of the ravages of variola in different\r\ncountries before and after the introduction of vaccination show that,\r\nwhile we cannot deny that some alternation (of generations\r\nrespectively more and less susceptible) may occur, no such law can\r\ncompare in influence with that of vaccination in the protection of\r\nindividuals subjected to it. Indeed, the argument may be inverted;\r\nthus: if in the days before Jenner small-pox itself weeded out the\r\npersons most liable to it, or in some way prepared a partial family-\r\nor race-protection, such a protection ought to be gradually conferred\r\nupon a whole population through universal and persistent vaccination\r\ncarried on for several generations.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for one hereditary constitution or diathesis to become,\r\nin transmission, not only modified, but transmuted, into another? Some\r\nof the older pathologists imagined this to be the case with syphilis,\r\nto whose past influence upon parents and ancestors they traced the\r\norigin of scrofula. But no sufficient ground for such a pathogeny can\r\nbe ascertained. All that appears to be left after scrutiny of the\r\nfacts is, that syphilis is a depressing and perverting agency, and so\r\nmay join with {131} other depressing causes in preparing the way for\r\nthe engendering of scrofulosis.\r\n\r\nA few points still remain to be briefly mentioned in connection with\r\nthe hereditary conveyance of proclivity to disease. One or several\r\nmembers of a family will often pass through life without any\r\nmanifestation of such transmission, while others, their brothers or\r\nsisters, give marked evidence of it. Sometimes a whole generation may\r\nbe passed over, and yet the predisposition may be abundantly shown in\r\nthat next following. This is closely similar to atavism, as it is\r\ncalled in zoology and general biology, according to which traits\r\noccurring under admixture or variation of animal or vegetable stocks\r\nmay be absent in the immediate offspring of a couple, but reappear in\r\ntheir next succeeding descendants, or even a still later reversion may\r\ntake place. Such instances are not rare, and they need to be\r\nconsidered in the proper study of the influence of parentage,\r\nintermarriage, etc. upon health and disease.\r\n\r\nA practical question of much importance (belonging, however, rather to\r\nsanitary than to medical science) is, how far confirmation or\r\nmodification of hereditary proclivities may occur through the effect\r\nof the conditions of marriage upon offspring. Consanguineous marriages\r\nhave been, time out of mind, held to be very objectionable. The\r\nquestion has been much discussed whether the ground of sanitary\r\nobjection is properly against such marriages as per se injurious to\r\noffspring, or whether the bad effect consists merely in reduplicating\r\nand intensifying family constitutional taints. It would not be in\r\nplace here to go into this controversy. My own conclusion is, that a\r\nnatural law of sexual polarity or affinity exists, according to which,\r\nin all the higher organisms, reproduction is most normal and gives the\r\nbest results when a considerable genetic difference (within the limits\r\nof species) exists between parents. While, however, this is probable,\r\nbut difficult to demonstrate, it appears to be certain that when a\r\nfather and mother both possess morbid constitutional predispositions\r\n(say, to phthisis, insanity, or gout), their children will be at least\r\ntwice as likely to suffer from the same as if only one parent were so\r\nendowed. Whether or not, then, the marriage of two perfectly healthy\r\nfirst-cousins may be expected (as several statisticians aver to have\r\nbeen shown) to be attended by defects of health in their progeny, the\r\nunion of such relations when their common progenitors were in marked\r\ndegree consumptive, or scrofulous, or liable to insanity, epilepsy,\r\netc., has attached to it so unfavorable a prognosis for offspring as\r\nto be rightly forbidden. Moreover, so few families possess an\r\nabsolutely faultless health-record that the chances of increasing\r\nexisting morbid traits by intermarriages are quite sufficient to\r\njustify the commonly held objection against them.\r\n\r\nWe must allude very briefly to the influence of conditions affecting\r\nconception and gestation upon the health of offspring. Intemperance in\r\nparents has, in many instances, been known to promote convulsions,\r\ninfantile or epileptic, and other cerebral or nervous disorders in\r\nchildren, besides a general feebleness of constitution. Even\r\nintoxication at the time of procreation has been asserted to mark a\r\nsimilar difference between one child and another of the same parents.\r\n\r\nAll are familiar with the (no doubt often quite imaginary) accounts of\r\nthe effect on infants in utero of powerful sensory or mental\r\nimpressions upon the mother during gestation. Abortion has,\r\nunquestionably, been {132} often produced by violent nervous shocks.\r\nWithout deciding the question whether \"monsters\" are ever developed in\r\ncorrespondence with particular experiences of the mother, we may hold\r\nit to be clear that all depressing and disturbing agencies may\r\ninterfere with the process of nutrition of the foetus, and thus\r\ndevelop mental anomalies, and that constitutional impairments may thus\r\nbe greatly promoted.\r\n\r\nAll inherited predispositions, it is important to remember, are\r\naggravated, and each proclivity changed to actuality, by those\r\ninfluences which in individuals tend to like effects upon health. Such\r\nbecome exciting causes of various diseases. If these be constantly\r\navoided, and all the surroundings and the mode of life of the\r\nindividual be maintained in a manner most favorable to health, the\r\nhereditary tendency may remain inert through a long lifetime. Every\r\nphysician must have seen this in scores of instances. The application\r\nof the principle through special precepts belongs to personal hygiene.\r\nBut no physician can rightly ignore the study of this subject, or omit\r\nthe utilization of his acquaintance with it by preventive advice to\r\nmembers of the families under his professional care.\r\n\r\nOur last remark in connection with pre-natal causation must be upon\r\nthe effects of circumstances and modes of living on masses of men,\r\nespecially in large cities and populous countries. Something has been\r\nsaid already of race-acclimatization by which there may be acquired a\r\nlessened susceptibility to certain endemic fevers.[2] Almost a reverse\r\naction is exhibited in the gradual lowering of vital energy under what\r\nhas been called the \"great-town system.\" While those having all the\r\ncomforts of life and avoiding excesses may manifest but little of this\r\ndeterioration, it is very observable in that mass of men, women, and\r\nchildren who become the subjects of medical charities. Closeness and\r\nuncleanliness of living, with more or less exposure to dampness and\r\nextremes either of heat or cold, with intemperance and syphilis, are\r\nthe main causes of this general constitutional impairment. So\r\nimportant is it that it should never be forgotten, not only in our\r\nestimate of the causation of diseases, but in our anticipation of\r\ntheir results, and also in our adaptation of measures of treatment,\r\nmedical and surgical, to different classes of patients. All that it is\r\nallowable here to suggest in this regard may be summed up (although\r\nvery imperfectly) in the word hospitalism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is important (but not before remarked in this article)\r\nthat cholera does not appear to allow of any such diminution of\r\nliability to it among the natives of the country in which it is\r\nendemic.]\r\n\r\nConditional causation has been, to a certain extent, included under\r\nwhat has been above said, as it is the action, in part at least, of\r\nsurrounding conditions, that establishes a family- or race-proclivity\r\nand inheritance. But we must say something more about the direct\r\naction of conditions upon individuals.\r\n\r\nMan, although organized with great delicacy of structure, is capable,\r\nby the use of his intelligence, of adapting himself to a wider variety\r\nof external conditions than any other animal. He is the only truly\r\ncosmopolitan being on the earth. From the remote Arctic regions to the\r\nhottest tropical climates there are tribes whose ancestors have dwelt\r\nfor centuries in the same localities. Not that no unfavorable\r\ninfluence attends these extremes. The Esquimaux are stunted, the\r\nSouthern Hindoo and {133} Central African are enfeebled and\r\ndegenerate, partly from climate. But with man's numerous protective\r\ndevices, great cold and great heat only exceptionally affect\r\nindividual health. Freezing to death follows unusual exposures; the\r\nloss of an extremity by sphacelus from congelation is more often met\r\nwith; heat-stroke also is tolerably frequent; and the influence of\r\nheat in producing cholera infantum in some large cities is very\r\nimportant; but much the most common kind of conditional morbid\r\ncausation is produced either by sudden changes of temperature or by\r\ndiversity of exposure of different parts of the body. These are the\r\ntwo usual modes of \"taking cold.\" When dampness accompanies a\r\nrelatively low temperature, such an effect is much more apt to follow\r\nthan in a cold dry atmosphere.\r\n\r\nActual cold-stroke, the analogue of heat-stroke, may sometimes happen.\r\nI once saw such a case in a previously healthy boy twelve years of\r\nage, who, after standing for an hour in his night-shirt on a cold\r\nwinter night, became almost immediately ill, fell into a comatose\r\nstate, and died in about thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nA simple rationale may be discerned for the phenomena of catching\r\ncold. When, for example, a draught of air blows for a time upon the\r\nback of a person at rest (especially one who has just before used\r\nactive exertion), the local refrigerant impression induces\r\nconstriction of the superficial blood-vessels. Hence follow two\r\neffects: one, the repulsion of blood in undue amount toward interior\r\norgans; the other, diminution, perhaps arrest, of excretion from the\r\nskin of the exposed portion of the body, and consequent retention of\r\nsome effete material, promoting esotoxæmia.[3] If, then, there be in\r\nthe body any weak organ--that is, one whose circulation is partially\r\nimpeded or whose nutritive and functional activity is low--it suffers\r\nfirst and most from the impulsion of blood from the surface.\r\nCongestion, irritation, and inflammation may follow, and we have an\r\nattack of pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis, or some phlegmasia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: That is, blood-poisoning, originating within the body\r\nitself; exotoxæmia being that which is enthetic--_i.e._ resulting from\r\na poison derived from without.]\r\n\r\nExcessive heat with dryness, as under the blasts of the Simoon or the\r\nHarmattan of Arabia or Northern Africa (apart from insolation,\r\nsunstroke, or heat-stroke), may sometimes parch the body even to a\r\nfatal degree. Much more common is the combination of high temperature\r\nwith humidity. This has a relaxing effect, promoting indolence of\r\ntemperament and predisposing to disorders of a catarrhal nature,\r\nespecially of the digestive organs, such as were called fluxes by the\r\nolder writers.\r\n\r\nCold climates are well known to present the greatest number of cases\r\nof acute and chronic affections of organs of the respiratory system;\r\nwarm and hot climates, those of the stomach, liver, spleen, and\r\nbowels. But we must recollect what various complications belong to\r\nclimate. Two important factors, especially, must be kept in view in\r\ncomparing the causation of diseases in colder and warmer\r\ncountries--namely, the difference in the articles of food partaken of\r\nin each, and the external sources of enthetic disorders; _e.g._\r\nendemic and epidemic fevers, etc.\r\n\r\nWith humidity must be considered variations in atmospheric pressure.\r\nPhysicists have long known that while watery vapor, by itself, is\r\nheavier than air which is perfectly dry, moist air is lighter than air\r\ncontaining {134} little or no moisture. Hence the barometer falls as\r\nthe quantity of atmospheric moisture approaches saturation. Other\r\ncauses, however, also affect barometric pressure. With the same degree\r\nof humidity, cold air is denser and heavier than warm air, and by its\r\ncontraction lowering the \"column\" of atmosphere--the temperature of\r\nwhich is reduced--a flow toward the upper part of the column increases\r\nthe actual mass of air pressing upon a particular place. Elevation of\r\na locality above the general level of the earth reduces atmospheric\r\npressure, sensibly as well as measurably. So \"the difficult air of the\r\niced mountain-top\" has become proverbial.\r\n\r\nThese variations are familiar, though all their effects upon human\r\nhealth have been by no means, as yet, fully studied. Most difficult to\r\ndetermine and analyze are the influences of changes of pressure,\r\nchiefly hygrometric, upon the course of diseases and upon the result\r\nof severe surgical operations. Among the few important series of\r\nobservations bearing on this topic have been those of Dr. S. Weir\r\nMitchell on neuralgia,[4] and Dr. Addinell Hewson on the prognosis of\r\nmajor operations,[5] in connection with the state of the weather. The\r\nformer ascertained a marked relation between the approach of a wave of\r\nlow barometric pressure and attacks of irregularly periodic neuralgia;\r\nthe latter proved, by the statistics of the Pennsylvania Hospital for\r\na number of years, that the most favorable time for amputations or\r\nother capital operations is when the barometer is high, or at least on\r\nthe ascent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _American Journal of Medical Sciences_, April, 1877, p.\r\n305.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Pennsylvania Hospital Reports_, 1868.]\r\n\r\nElectrical atmospheric states and vicissitudes have, quite probably, a\r\npractical consequence beyond what is usually ascribed to them in\r\nconnection with health and disease. But their effects are so difficult\r\nto disentangle from those of other meteorological causes that we must\r\nbe content at present without attempting their exact specification.\r\nThe same observation may be made with reference to ozone.\r\n\r\nElevation of site has importance, not only in regard to climatic\r\nhygiene, but also to its therapeutic use, particularly in the\r\ntreatment of phthisis, goitre, and some affections of the nervous\r\nsystem. But in our brief and general survey of Etiology this topic\r\nmust be left without discussion, since no disorder appears to be\r\ntraceable to elevation alone, beyond the temporary prostration on\r\nexertion, with hemorrhages from the nose, lungs, etc., often produced\r\nin those who climb to great mountain-heights or ascend rapidly in\r\nballoons. It has been shown by ample experience that considerable\r\npopulations may live in ordinary health through long periods at\r\naltitudes more than 10,000 feet above the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nDepression below the surface of the earth has never become a part of\r\nhuman experience beyond the limit of a few hundred feet. Miners living\r\nunderground in a few places in Europe have been found to exhibit\r\ncomparatively feeble health, but the privation of sunlight, the\r\nconfined atmosphere, and the dampness of such unnatural abodes will\r\nsuffice to account for these effects.\r\n\r\nUnder functional causation of disease we may include all excessive,\r\ndeficient, or abnormal exercise of any of the organs of the body. To\r\nsimple excess may be ascribed the scrivener's or bank-officer's\r\nparalysis of the muscles of the hand used in continuous writing; brain\r\n{135} exhaustion from mental labor or anxiety, unrelieved by\r\nsufficient sleep; and sexual impotence, temporary or lasting (or\r\nsometimes even general paralysis), from inordinate sexual or sensual\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\nDeficiency of functional exercise is observed to produce disability,\r\nas when the muscles of a limb, for instance, are for a long time\r\nrestrained from use. Surgeons meet with this inconvenience (unless\r\nassiduously guarded against) when a fractured limb is kept long at\r\nrest in a fixed position. Atrophy of the mammæ in single women of\r\nretired lives is common; atrophy of the testicles in unmarried men\r\nmuch less so. These changes, however, are physiological, not\r\npathological; upon alteration of conditions--_e.g._ marriage--the\r\natrophy will disappear altogether.\r\n\r\nAbnormal functional action as a cause of morbid results is seen when\r\nthe eyes are injured by reading, writing, or doing any delicate work\r\nin a bad light; for instance, late twilight. Also, in a secondary or\r\naccessory manner, when a near-sighted person, having the action of the\r\nmuscles of convergence in excess of his accommodation, or a\r\nlong-sighted (hyperopic) person, whose accommodation is in excess of\r\nconvergence, suffers from asthenopia, perhaps with headache, distress,\r\nnausea, etc. Another example of abnormal functional exercise and its\r\neffects is that of self-abuse, where the unnatural mechanical\r\nimitation of the physiological act of sexual coition induces\r\ndisturbances of the nervous and circulatory systems, besides debility\r\nfrom excess.\r\n\r\nIngestive causation is a sufficiently fit designation for all errors\r\nof diet, as well as misuse of medicines, and poisoning. Starvation or\r\ninanition belongs to the same category by negation. Gluttony and\r\nintemperance are major members in the ingestive series, while haste in\r\ntaking food, without mastication, and the use of heavy bread, unripe\r\nfruit, and other indigestible articles, account for many cases of\r\ndyspepsia and some of colic, cholera morbus, diarrhoea, etc. With\r\nyoung children, especially, no more frequently acting cause of\r\ndisorder exists than dietetic mismanagement, most of all during the\r\nperiod of dentition, and earlier, when, from absence or insufficiency\r\nof mother's milk, they have to be artificially fed. Then the supply of\r\ngood fresh cow's, goat's, or ass's milk may carry them well through\r\ninfancy, while a regimen of arrowroot or gum-arabic and water, or\r\nstale, half sour milk, may either starve or sicken them to death. On\r\nthe subject of poisons and of misuse of medicines we have no occasion\r\nhere to make special remark. Only it may be mentioned that the\r\npossibility of either is always to be remembered by the physician in\r\nmaking up his mind in regard to the origin of symptoms observed.\r\n\r\nEnthetic causation is a large subject, including all origination of\r\ndisease by the introduction of morbid materials from without the\r\nbody.[6] Medical opinion has generally accepted, and facts fully\r\nsustain, the recognition of three groups of enthetic disorders, viz.:\r\nthose which are personally contagious; such as are locally epidemic;\r\nand epidemic diseases. Of the first group it will suffice to mention,\r\nas an example, syphilis; of the second, intermittent fever; of the\r\nthird, influenza.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Simon has proposed the term exopathic to indicate the\r\norigin of such maladies; autopathic disorders being those which\r\noriginate within the body itself.]\r\n\r\nWere all maladies whose causation is evidently of external origin\r\ncapable of the same clear discrimination as these, we should have no\r\ndifficulty with the present topic. But, in fact, no subject connected\r\nwith {136} the history of disease has become surrounded by more\r\nintricate controversy. Many times the same facts are, or appear to be,\r\nexplicable in two or three different ways. What some hold to be proofs\r\nof contagion from person to person, others are ready to account for by\r\nthe subjection of a number of persons or of a whole community to\r\neither a common local or a widespread migrating (epidemic) influence.\r\nIt is sometimes impossible, in the nature of things, to obtain an\r\nabsolute demonstration of the truth of one or another of these\r\ntheories without such experiments upon human beings as are\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nWhile endeavoring to ascertain the limits of our present knowledge\r\nupon these questions, let us first notice what are the most positive\r\nfacts concerning them, some of which are common to the whole group or\r\nclass of what have been, since Liebig, often called zymotic,[7] but\r\nlatterly more often enthetic, diseases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The term zymotic has, with many authors, fallen into\r\ndisrepute, chiefly because Liebig's hypothesis concerning the\r\nchemico-physical action of ferments, as well as of contagia, has lost\r\nground in comparison with the vital or disease-germ theory. Yet the\r\nanalogy between fermentation, putrefaction, and the action of a virus\r\non an animal organism persists; whatever may be the theory of their\r\nexplanation, something appears to be common or similar in all these\r\nprocesses.]\r\n\r\nThese diseases may be enumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Only produced by contact or inoculation_.\r\n\r\n  Primary Syphilis,\r\n  Gonorrhoea,\r\n  Vaccinia,\r\n  Hydrophobia.\r\n\r\n2. _Contagious also by atmospheric transmission through short\r\ndistances_.\r\n\r\n  Variola,\r\n  Varioloid,\r\n  Varicella,\r\n  Measles,\r\n  Diphtheria,\r\n  Scarlatina,\r\n  Rötheln,\r\n  Mumps,\r\n  Whooping Cough,\r\n  Typhus,\r\n  Relapsing Fever.\r\n\r\n3. _Endemic, occasionally epidemic_.\r\n\r\n  Malarial Fevers (Intermittent, Remittent, and Pernicious Fever),\r\n  Dengue,\r\n  Yellow Fever.\r\n\r\n4. _Other zymotic or enthetic diseases_.\r\n\r\n  Influenza,\r\n  Cerebro-spinal Fever,\r\n  Erysipelas,\r\n  Puerperal Fever,\r\n  Tropical Dysentery,\r\n  Typhoid Fever,\r\n  Cholera,\r\n  Plague.\r\n\r\nAs all observers are agreed in regard to the personal transmission of\r\nthe first named of these series (variola, etc.), we need to give\r\nattention here only to the other groups; except merely to say that the\r\neasily demonstrable existence of a morbid material (virus) in the\r\ninstances of primary syphilis, gonorrhoea, variola, and vaccinia\r\npresents a very cogent analogical argument for the presumption that\r\nall clearly contagious (even {137} though non-eruptive) maladies, such\r\nas mumps and whooping cough, must also have a morbid material as their\r\nessential cause; and also in favor of the supposition that a morbid\r\nmaterial may probably be the \"causa sine quâ non\" of each of the other\r\nmaladies which are known to be endemic or epidemic. A few theorists\r\nonly have argued in favor of any other view than this. Sir James\r\nMurray and Dr. Craig of Scotland, and Dr. S. Littell of Philadelphia,\r\nhave sustained an electrical hypothesis, and Oldham and others have\r\nadvocated one connected with changes of bodily temperature, or ozone,\r\netc., for the origination of certain endemic and epidemic diseases.\r\nBut all the facts point toward the existence of material causes,\r\nspecific for each of these disorders, and many observations and much\r\ningenuity of reasoning have been brought to bear upon the question as\r\nto their intimate nature.\r\n\r\nAre these materiæ morborum merely inorganic elements or compounds\r\nentering human bodies and acting there as chemical poisons? Against\r\nsuch a supposition we have, as almost decisive objections, not only\r\nthe absence, under the most searching analysis, of any chemical\r\npeculiarity in the air of malarious or otherwise infected regions, but\r\nalso the clinging of many endemic and epidemic causes (as known by\r\ntheir effects) to particular localities, notwithstanding the\r\nrecognized law of the diffusion of gases which must antagonize such\r\nconcentration. Therefore, we may rule out, as highly improbable at\r\nleast, the hypothesis of the inorganic gaseous nature of malaria, as\r\nwell as of the essential causes of yellow fever, cholera, plague, and\r\nthe other analogous diseases.\r\n\r\nBy the once general use of the term zymotic, there is suggested a line\r\nof thought which has been quite prevalent since the prominence of\r\nLiebig's teachings in chemical physiology, until recently. That great\r\nchemist did not imagine that a true zymosis or fermentation occurs\r\nunder the action of a virus upon the human economy. His thought was\r\nmore clearly expressed, in the phraseology of the late Dr. Snow of\r\nLondon, as the theory of continuous molecular change. Its most\r\nstriking physical instance or analogue is the extension of flame from\r\na burning body to combustible matter within its reach. Sugar formation\r\nfrom starch by diastase, and the change of albumen into peptone by\r\npepsin, are familiar examples, in organic materials, of the\r\npropagation of molecular movement in special directions and with\r\ncharacteristic results.[8] It does not seem to be more than a short\r\nstep from these to the processes which we study in fermentation,\r\nputrefaction, septicæmia, and the multiplication of small-pox\r\ncontagion, from the smallest inoculation, in the human body.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: In anticipation of the argument concerning the necessity\r\nof the action of minute living organisms to produce fermentation,\r\nputrefaction, and specific diseases, emphasis may be here laid upon\r\nthe fact that the above named changes, and many others like them, are\r\nproduced, in the absence of such organisms, by chemical agents formed\r\nin the body, or even (as when sulphuric acid changes starch to sugar)\r\nby inorganic substances. Pasteur considers that the yeast-cell\r\nsecretes a sort of diastase which changes starch or cane-sugar into\r\nglucose, on which the cell then lives, decomposing the glucose into\r\nalcohol, carbonic acid, etc. Koch and others now assert that a\r\nbacillus produces the souring of milk, and another the butyric acid\r\nfermentation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The assertion of some advocates of the \"germ theory of\r\ndisease,\" that only living organisms reproduce their kind, loses\r\nweight as an argument in view of the natural history of small-pox and\r\nanalogous diseases; unless it be proved that every particle of\r\ncontagious matter is (at one time at least) a living organism.]\r\n\r\nBut here comes in a new hypothetical factor, introduced by the aid of\r\n{138} the microscope, although anticipated conjecturally before actual\r\ndiscoveries in this field were made certain. So prominent is this\r\nsubject in the discussions of the present time, under the expression\r\n\"the germ theory of disease,\" that we are justified in giving\r\nattention to it here somewhat at length.\r\n\r\nStahl proposed a purely chemical theory of fermentation early in the\r\nseventeenth century. Not much later Hauptmann suggested the probable\r\ncausation of epidemic diseases by minute living organisms. Linnæus[10]\r\nrevived this hypothesis in the eighteenth century. These two topics of\r\ninquiry, with the intermediate one of putrefaction, then received much\r\nattention, at first apart, but afterward with recognition of their\r\nanalogies. When Fabroni, Cagniard de la Tour, Schwann, and Kützing\r\nhad, with the aid of the microscope, made familiar the life-history of\r\nthe yeast-fungus[11] (Saccharomyces cerevisiæ), more close\r\nconsideration still was given to these remarkable changes in organic\r\nmaterials and forms, dead and living.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Linnæus accepted the asserted observation by Rolander of\r\nacari in the stools in dysentery. The great naturalist deviated\r\nsomewhat here from his usual carefulness and accuracy, as that\r\nobservation was not afterward verified.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Lëuwenhoek, however, had observed and described it in\r\n1680.]\r\n\r\nStarting from the physical basis of inorganic chemistry, Liebig\r\nfollowed the series up from the so-called catalytic[12] action by\r\nwhich the presence of a substance, itself apparently unchanged,\r\ninduces reaction between two or more other bodies, to those which\r\noccur within plants and animals, as examples of vital chemistry. Such\r\nis the influence of diastase or invertin, which in the seeds of plants\r\nbrings on the conversion of starch into sugar and of cane-sugar into\r\nglucose and levulose. Such is the agency of ptyalin in the saliva, of\r\npepsin in the gastric juice, and of pancreatin or trypsin in the\r\nsecretion of the pancreas, in the processes of digestion. From these\r\nit appears to be an easy transition to those changes which occur in\r\norganic matter no longer living, as in the fermentation of vegetable\r\njuices and the putrefaction of animal tissues.[13] Liebig endeavored\r\nto explain these also in the same manner as the chemico-vital\r\nprocesses; and he then went farther to apply the same generalization\r\nto the propagation of disease, by what is called virus, in the\r\ninstances of contagious, endemic, and epidemic maladies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The idea expressed by this term was especially favored\r\nby Berzelius and Mitscherlich.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: It is noticeable, however, although generally forgotten,\r\nthat the one set of changes and assimilations (namely, those of\r\ndigestion) are formative actions of life, and the others destructive,\r\nin the direction of, or subsequent to, death.]\r\n\r\nBut, meanwhile, observation and speculation gave almost equal\r\nprominence to the importance of minute living organisms in the\r\napparent instigation of all these evidently analogous changes of\r\nfermentation, putrefaction, suppuration, septicæmia (Piorry, 1835),\r\ninfection, and contagion.\r\n\r\nUpon this side the leading investigator for many years has been\r\nPasteur. As long ago, however, as 1813 Astier, and in 1840 Henle of\r\nBerlin, and near the same time Sir Henry Holland of London and Dr. J.\r\nK. Mitchell of Philadelphia, gave expression to opinions of a similar\r\nkind, based upon many important facts before very much overlooked. By\r\nexact experimentation, moreover, Schwann, Helmholtz, Schroeder, and\r\nDusch ascertained that the agent or agents causative of fermentation\r\nand putrefaction can be detained by heated tubes, by animal membranes,\r\n{139} and by cotton wool, anticipating the later observations of\r\nPasteur,[14] Tyndall, Chauveau, and others to the same or similar\r\neffect. These results of experiments are commonly understood to prove\r\nthe particulate character of the agents so studied. What may be called\r\nan era in the practical application of etiological inquiry dates from\r\nthe introduction by Lister (about 1860) of the principles of\r\nantiseptic surgery, based upon the theory that disease-germs, derived\r\nfrom the atmosphere or other external sources, are the essential\r\ncauses of suppuration, septicæmia, pyæmia, gangrene, etc. following\r\ninjuries or operations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Pasteur's experiments with long-drawn bent tubes had\r\nespecial significance.]\r\n\r\nSo far from this inquiry being yet terminated, while experiments and\r\nobservations have become more and more numerous and elaborate,\r\nopinions continue to differ; and we must yet await the time when, by\r\nsuccessively excluding, one after another, all the sources of error, a\r\ntruly scientific conclusion may be obtained.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, it may be said that parties in the debate are\r\nchiefly ranged upon two sides--those who favor the probability that\r\nonly chemical, not vital, action is to be traced in fermentation,\r\nputrefaction, suppuration, infection, and contagion; and those who\r\nregard minute organisms, discovered or undiscovered, as causative of,\r\nand indispensable to, all these processes.\r\n\r\nWithout intention of injustice to other able investigators, the\r\nprincipal names so far associated with the former of these views may\r\nbe thus mentioned: Panum (1856), Robin, Bergmann, Liebig, Colin,\r\nLebert, Vulpian, Onimus, B. W. Richardson,[15] Beale,[16] Senator,\r\nRosenberger, Hiller, Nægeli, Schottelius, Harley, Jacobi, Curtis, and\r\nSatterthwaite. Of those maintaining, in some form and with more or\r\nless positiveness, the disease-germ theory, the most conspicuous,\r\nespecially as observers, have been Tuchs (1848), Royer (1850),\r\nDavaine, Branell, Pollender, Pasteur, Tyndall, Lister, Mayrhofer,\r\nOrtel, Letzerich, Nassiloff, Hueter, Toussaint, Hansen, Salisbury,\r\nKlob, Hallier, Basch, Virchow, Neisser, Eberth, Tommasi Crudeli,\r\nKlebs, Talamon, Schüller, Tappeiner, Cohnheim, Koch, Baumgarten,\r\nBuchner, Aufrecht, Birch-Hirschfeld, Greenfield, and Ogston. Besides\r\nthese the elaborate studies of microphytes by Cohn, and those of Coze\r\nand Feltz, Waldeyer, Recklinghausen, and others upon septic poisoning,\r\nhave been of acknowledged importance; and the experimental labors of\r\nBurdon Sanderson in England, and Sternberg,[17] H. C. Wood, and Formad\r\nin the United States (under the auspices of the National Board of\r\nHealth), possess great value. But the scientific caution of these last\r\ninquirers, like that of Magnin, has prevented them from formulating,\r\nas yet, positive and final opinions upon the subject. It is not saying\r\ntoo much to assert nearly the same of {140} several of those mentioned\r\nabove, as inclining to one or the other side of the controversy.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Dr. Richardson has long contended for the doctrine first\r\nproposed by Panum, that a peculiar chemical agent, (called by Bergmann\r\n_sepsin_) is the cause of blood-poisoning from virulent absorption or\r\ninoculation. Latterly, attention has been called by Selmi and other\r\nobservers to the existence of complex compounds called _ptomaïnes_ in\r\ndecomposing animal substances--_e.g._ the human body after\r\ndeath--these having considerable resemblance in their toxic action to\r\nthe poisonous vegetable alkaloids.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Opposed at least to the ordinary form of the germ theory\r\nof disease.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Sternberg's observations and experiments (following\r\nthose of Pasteur) with the inoculation of animals with saliva, proving\r\nthat even when taken from perfectly healthy men this may be fatally\r\npoisonous to animals, possess remarkable interest. They do not seem,\r\nhowever, to be decisive either way in regard to the germ theory of\r\ninfection.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Billroth and Cohnheim are among those who have changed\r\ntheir opinions on this subject after prolonged investigation.]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that the data for a final conclusion have not\r\nyet been made certain. Several hypotheses are conceivable, and\r\ncapable, each, of plausible support:\r\n\r\n1. The purely chemical theory of Liebig, Gerhardt, Bergmann, Snow of\r\nLondon, and B. W. Richardson.\r\n\r\n2. The bioplastic hypothesis of Beale, according to which germinal\r\nmatter may be detached from a living body and planted, while yet\r\nretaining vitality, upon another, and there may undergo changes more\r\nor less morbid, and destructive of the body by which it has been\r\nreceived. This theory of migrating or transplanted bioplasts has\r\nreceived very little support besides that of its distinguished author.\r\n\r\n3. That the minute organisms discovered so constantly upon diseased\r\nparts of plants and animals (_e.g._ ergot of rye, _Peronospora\r\ninfestans_ of potato-rot, _Botrytis Bassiana_ of silk-worm muscardine,\r\n_Panhistophyton_ of silk-worm pebrine, _Empusa muscæ_ of the fly,\r\n_Achorion_, _Tricophyton_, _Oidium_, and _Leptothrix_ of human\r\naffections of the skin and mucous membranes) are incidental or\r\naccidental only[19]--acting, as R. Owen observes, {141} most commonly\r\nas natural scavengers in the consumption of effete organic material;\r\nbut that they may become noxious under two sorts of\r\ncircumstances--viz. when their numbers are enormously increased, as is\r\nknown to be the case with trichinæ in the human body, and also when\r\nthey are brought in considerable number into contact with bodies\r\nalready diseased, or at least suffering under depression of vital\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: This possibility has not been as yet altogether ruled\r\nout in regard to Koch's _Bacillus tuberculosis_; concerning which\r\nactive discussion has been going on during the past year or two\r\n(1882-83). A very large number of observers confirm the statement that\r\nthe bacilli are found in most specimens of tubercle. Several, also,\r\nhave repeated with success Koch's inoculation experiments, in which\r\ntubercle appeared to be propagated by carefully isolated bacilli. But\r\nmany facts still stand in the way of the conclusion that the bacillus\r\nis the causa sine quâ non of tuberculosis. First, examples of the\r\nproduction of phthisis by apparent contagion or infection are few.\r\nAlthough Dr. C. T. Williams found bacilli in the air of the wards of\r\nthe Hospital for Consumptives at Brompton, yet of the experience of\r\nthat hospital Dr. Vincent Edwards, for seventeen years its resident\r\nmedical officer, reports as follows: \"Of fifty-nine resident medical\r\nassistants who lived in the hospital an average of six months each,\r\nonly two are dead, and these not from phthisis. Three of the living\r\nare said to have phthisis. The chaplain and the matron had each lived\r\nthere for over sixteen years. Very many nurses had been in residence\r\nfor periods varying from months to several years. The head-nurses,\"\r\nsays the writer, \"sleep each in a room containing fifty patients. Two\r\nhead-nurses only are known to have died--one from apoplexy; the other\r\nhead-nurse was here seven months, was unhappily married, and some time\r\nafterward died of phthisis. Of the nurses now in residence, one has\r\nbeen here twenty-four years, two twelve years, one eight years, one\r\nseven years, one six and a half years, and one five years. No\r\nunder-nurse, as far as I am aware, has died of phthisis. All the\r\nphysicians who have attended the in-and-out patients during the past\r\nseventeen years are living, except two, who did not die from\r\nphthisis.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the inoculation and inhalation experiments of Villemin,\r\nTappeiner, Koch, Wilson Fox, and others, by which the specific\r\ncharacter of tubercle has been said to be proved, must be placed those\r\nof Sanderson, Foulis, Papillon, Lebert, Waldenburg, Schottelius, Wood\r\nand Formad, Robinson, and others, by which tubercles have been induced\r\nby the injection, inoculation, or inhalation of various non-tubercular\r\nmaterials. In answer to the argument from these, it is asserted by\r\nKoch and his supporters that \"there is no anatomical or morphological\r\ncharacteristic of tubercle,\" its only sufficient test being its\r\ninoculability. This is almost begging the question; at all events, it\r\nleaves it, for the present, unsettled. Moreover, tubercular deposits\r\ndo not always contain bacilli, as has been shown by Spina, Sternberg,\r\nFormad, Prudden (_N.Y. Medical Record_, April 14 and June 16, 1883).\r\nThe last named made, in one well marked case, six hundred and\r\nninety-five sections from ninety-nine tubercles in different portions\r\nof a tuberculous pleura, all of Koch's precautions being observed in\r\nthe examination. Belfield (_Lectures on Micro-Organisms and Disease_)\r\nadmits the possibility that tuberculosis may be produced by either of\r\nseveral causes. It has, at least, not yet been demonstrated that the\r\ntubercular tissue is more than a nidus or favorable \"culture-ground\"\r\nfor the bacilli, or that, in the presence of a constitutional\r\npredisposition, they may not merely promote a more rapid destruction\r\nof the invaded organs or tissues.]\r\n\r\n4. That such organisms are the essential and direct causes of enthetic\r\nmaladies by invading the human and other living bodies as parasites,\r\nconsuming and disorganizing their tissues, blood corpuscles,[20] etc.\r\nPasteur considers the abstraction of oxygen an important part of their\r\naction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Against this view stands especially the objection that,\r\nas Cohn, Burdon Sanderson, and others have fully shown, bacteria and\r\nother Schizomycetæ obtain their nitrogen, not from organized tissues,\r\nbut from ammonia, and their carbon and hydrogen from the results of\r\ndecomposition in organic tissues. (See B. Sanderson, in _Brit. Med.\r\nJournal_, Jan. 16, 1875.) Pasteur has regarded the relation of these\r\norganisms to oxygen as important; some of them requiring it for their\r\nexistence (ærobic), and others not (anærobic). He has defined\r\nfermentation as \"life without free oxygen.\"]\r\n\r\n5. That these microbes, microphytes, or mycrozymes act not as\r\nparasites, but as poison-producers, secreting a sort of ferment which\r\nis the specific morbid material (Virchow); or, when multiplying in\r\nexcess of their food-material, they may die, and their dead bodies,\r\nlike other decaying organic matter, may become poisonous. This\r\npossibility, although not distinctly suggested (so far as I know)\r\nhitherto, appears to me to be not unworthy of consideration. That the\r\nnumbers of micro-organisms present have some important relation to\r\nmorbid conditions has long since been inferred from familiar facts.\r\n\r\n6. That they are not generators, but carriers, of disease-producing\r\npoisons; their vitality giving to the latter a continuance of\r\nexistence and capacity of accumulation and transportation not\r\notherwise possible.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the following is a summary of the most generally accepted\r\nclassification of those microscopic organisms[21] whose rôle in the\r\ncausation of diseases is now under discussion; chiefly following Cohn\r\nand Klebs:\r\n\r\n_Orders_: Hyphomycetæ, Algæ, Schizomycetæ.\r\n\r\nHyphomycetæ, _genera_: Achorion, Tricophyton, Oidium.\r\n\r\nAlgæ, _genera_: Sarcina, Leptothrix.\r\n\r\nSchizomycetæ, or Bacteria, _genera_: Micrococcus, Rod-bacterium,\r\nBacillus, Spirillum.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: For further details concerning these the reader is\r\nreferred to the works of Magnin, Belfield, and Gradle on _The\r\nBacteria_, and on the _Germ Theory of Disease_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Cohn also separates vibrio and spirochæte as genera\r\ndistinct from spirillum. They may, however, be regarded rather as\r\nspecies of that genus. Some recent authors included bacterium and\r\nbacillus under one genus, bacillus; against which simplification there\r\nseems to be no valid objection.]\r\n\r\nMicrococci (Sphærobacteria of Cohn) are asserted (under certain\r\nconditions) by Letzerich, Wood, and Formad[23] to be causative of\r\ndiphtheria; Ogston has found them in ordinary pus; Rindfleisch,\r\nRecklinghausen, Waldeyer, Birch-Hirschfeld, and others report them to\r\nbe always present in the abscesses of pyæmia; Buhl, Waldeyer, and\r\nWagner state their occurrence in intestinal mycosis; Eberth, Köster,\r\nMaier, Burkhardt, and Osler, in ulcerative endocarditis; Orth,\r\nLukomsky, Fehleisen, and Loeffler, in erysipelas; Coats and Stephen in\r\npyelo-nephritis; Friedländer, in pneumonia; Eklund (_Plax scindens_)\r\nin scarlet fever; Keating[24] and {142} Le Bel, in measles; Leyden and\r\nGaudier, in cerebro-spinal meningitis; Carmona del Valle, in yellow\r\nfever; Prior, in dysentery; Gaffky, Leistikow, Bokai, and Bockhardt,\r\nin gonorrhoea;[25] besides other similar observations by numerous\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Bulletin of National Board of Health_, Supplement No.\r\n17, Jan. 21, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _The Medical News_, Philadelphia, July 29, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Sternberg's careful experimentation seems to show the\r\nidentity of Neisser's gonococcus with the Micrococcus ureæ, commonly\r\nfound in decomposing urine.]\r\n\r\nBacterium termo is regarded by leading authorities as the special\r\nferment or causative agent of putrefaction[26] (Billroth, Cohn).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Others have referred putrefaction to vibriones, less\r\nprecisely described.]\r\n\r\nBacillus includes, hypothetically at least, several species; as\r\nBacillus subtilis, the innocent hay-fungus; Bacillus anthracis, the\r\nmicrobe of malignant pustule (anthrax, milzbrand, charbon) and the\r\nsplenic fever of sheep; Bacillus typhosus (Klebs, Eberth, Meyer) of\r\ntyphoid fever; Bacillus lepræ (Hansen, Neisser, Cornil, Koebner) of\r\nleprosy;[27] Bacillus malariæ, reported as having been\r\ndemonstrated[28] by Klebs and Tommasi Crudeli, Marchand, Ceri, and\r\nZiehl; Bacillus tuberculosis (Koch, Baumgarten, 1882); the bacillus of\r\nmalignant oedema (Gaffky, Brieger, Ehrlich); that of syphilis\r\n(Aufrecht, Birch-Hirschfeld,[29] Morrison); of glanders (Loeffler,\r\nSchuetz, Israel, Bouchard); of pertussis (Burger); besides the\r\nActinomycosis of Israel, Ponfick,[30] Bollinger, and others. Koch has\r\nvery recently (1883) been reported to have discovered in Egypt the\r\nbacillus of cholera.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Dr. H. D. Schmidt of New Orleans, an experienced\r\npathologist, reported (_Chicago Medical Journal and Examiner_, April,\r\n1882) that critical examination of numerous specimens of tissues from\r\nthree cases of leprosy under his care failed to verify the existence\r\nof bacilli as characteristic of that disease.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Not certainly, however, as shown by Sternberg (_Bulletin\r\nof Nat. Board of Health_, Supplement No. 14, July 23, 1881). Dr.\r\nSalisbury of Ohio in 1866 made a series of observations, on the basis\r\nof which he asserted the discovery of a genus of malarial microphytes,\r\nwhich he referred to the family of _Palmellæ_.\r\n\r\nThe oval and spherical organisms described by Richard and Laveran as\r\nfound in the blood of malarial patients resembled micrococci rather\r\nthan bacilli.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: More recently described by him as micrococci.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Die Actinomykose_, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.

They have been found present in the blood only during the\r\nfebrile paroxysm, disappearing in the intermission and through\r\nconvalescence.\r\n\r\nHastening to close our consideration of this subject, we may note,\r\nwithout much argument, a few of the points of difficulty needing yet\r\nto be more fully illuminated by {143} careful observation before any\r\nform of the germ theory can take its place as an established doctrine\r\nin etiology:\r\n\r\n1. The absence of the characters belonging to definite organisms[31]\r\nin the easily-studied virus of small-pox and vaccinia stands, a\r\npriori, against the probability of such organisms being essential to\r\nthe causation of other enthetic diseases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: The particulate character of variolous and vaccine virus\r\nhas been already alluded to, as asserted to have been shown by\r\nChauveau and others. Yet it is not absolutely demonstrated that\r\nfiltration may not produce an important chemical alteration in some\r\nkinds of highly unstable organic material subjected to it. Cohn\r\nfigures a Micrococcus vacciniæ in his article on Bacteria\r\n(_Microscopical Journal_, vol. xiii., N. S., pl. v., Fig. 2). Beale\r\ndenies (_Microscope in Medicine_, 4th ed.) the existence of any\r\norganisms in vaccine virus. Lugginbuhl, Weigert, Klebs, Pohl-Pincus,\r\nand others have asserted their existence, but, especially in the\r\nabsence of any successful culture experiments, it does not seem to be\r\nproved.]\r\n\r\n2. Analogy in nature, showing the commonly beneficial action of\r\nnutritive processes in re-appropriating the products of organic decay\r\non a large or on a small scale, makes the scavenger theory of the\r\ngeneral function of minute cryptogamic organisms more probable, per\r\nse, than that which holds many of them to be destructive parasites or\r\npoison-producers in the bodies which they may inhabit. Few well known\r\nparasites are capable of causing death in higher animals or in man.\r\n\r\n3. These microbes are among the minutest objects which can be studied\r\nunder the microscope. Bacteria average about 1/9000 of an inch in\r\ntheir longest diameter; micrococci and spores (Dauersporen, Billroth)\r\nare yet smaller. Much care, therefore, as well as skill, must be\r\nexercised in making observations upon them.[32] Huxley asserted a few\r\n{144} years ago that a distinguished English pathologist had mistaken\r\nfor movements of minute living organisms the \"Brownian movements\" seen\r\nin the particles of many not living substances under a high magnifying\r\npower. One observer, at least,[33] considers that the forms designated\r\nas bacteria and micrococci, etc. are either forms of coagulated fibrin\r\nor granules from morbidly-altered blood-corpuscles (zoogloea of\r\nBillroth, Wood, Formad, and others). Koch denies the validity of the\r\nobservation of organisms in tubercle by Klebs and Schüller, while\r\ninsisting upon his own demonstration of a bacillus tuberculosis.\r\nAuthorities must, by mutual confirmation or correction, remove these\r\nobscurities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: A very interesting discovery was made by Tyndall, to the\r\neffect that while one boiling of a liquid would sterilize it for the\r\ntime by destroying all the bacteria present, their spores might still\r\nretain vitality and be afterward developed. By repeated exposure to a\r\nboiling temperature, taking these spores in their developing stage,\r\nthey were destroyed, and complete sterilization was effected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: R. Gregg, _N.Y. Med. Record_, Feb. 11, 1882. Sternberg,\r\nhowever, has replied to him (_N.Y. Med. Record_, April 8, 1882, p.\r\n368). The latter admits a doubt as to whether the granules seen within\r\nthe leucocytes by Wood and Formad in diphtheritic material, and\r\nbelieved by them to be micrococci, are such, or are merely granules\r\nformed or set free by disorganization of protoplasm within the\r\nleucocytes. This uncertainty well illustrates the difficulty of these\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nA chemical test much relied upon is, that bacteria resist the action\r\nof acids and alkalies, which destroy granular material of animal\r\norigin; also, that all these organisms are deeply stained by aniline\r\ndyes and by hæmatoxylin. The most decisive test, however, is\r\ncultivation in a liquid sterilized by heat. Koch prefers a process of\r\ndry culture for the bacillus of tubercle.\r\n\r\nGradle (_Lectures on the Germ Theory of Disease_, Chicago, 1883, p.\r\n28) says that the absolute criterion of the life of bacteria is their\r\npower of multiplication.]\r\n\r\n4. Bacteria and micrococci have been abundantly discovered (Kolaczck;\r\nJ. G. Richardson) in healthy bodies upon the various mucous membranes\r\nand in the blood. The correctness of such observations has been\r\ndenied, but, so far at least as the mucous membranes are concerned, it\r\nhas been well established by Nothnagel, Sternberg, and others.\r\nBacteria have sometimes been found in countless numbers in fecal\r\ndischarges.\r\n\r\n5. Bacteria become most numerous in materials of a septic or\r\ninfectious character after their period of toxic intensity has passed\r\nby.\r\n\r\n6. Suppuration can be produced (Uskoff, Orthmann) without the presence\r\nof minute organisms of any kind. Bacteria have been found {145} under\r\nLister's antiseptic dressings without suppuration following. Paul Bert\r\ndestroyed all the microbes in a septic liquid, and yet found it to\r\nretain its poisonous quality. Rosenberger (1881) has made similar\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nPanum, Coze, and Seltz, Bergmann and Schmiedeberg, Hiller, Vulpian,\r\nRosenberger, Clementi, Thin, and Dreyer have, by various elaborate\r\ninvestigations, proved that fatal septic poisoning can be produced in\r\nanimals by the products of organic decomposition, without the presence\r\nof living organisms. Zweifel's experiments seem to have shown that\r\nnormal blood, when deprived of oxygen, in the absence of\r\nmicro-organisms, may acquire septic properties.\r\n\r\nAs stated by Belfield,[34] many experiments by Schmidt, Edelberg,\r\nKöhler, Nencki, and others, have shown that septicæmia may be induced\r\nby the injection into the blood of free fibrin ferment and other\r\nsubstances, in the absence of minute organisms. To such an affection\r\nsome authors now give the name sapræmia, to distinguish it from\r\nbacterial infective disorders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Lectures on the Relation of Micro-organisms to\r\nDisease_, 1883.]\r\n\r\nGriffini ascertained that mixed saliva, filtered through porous\r\nplates, and thus containing no microbes, will still produce septicæmia\r\nin animals, when subcutaneously injected. Colin (1876) has denied the\r\nconclusiveness of the experiments of Chauveau, which have been held to\r\nprove the particulate nature of variolous and vaccine virus. Moreover,\r\nit is well known that eggs with shells unbroken are tainted when\r\nplaced near others which are unsound.\r\n\r\n7. While Klebs and Koch maintain the definite specificity of each\r\nminute microphytic organism, Nægeli and Billroth assert their mutual\r\nconvertibility. Burdon Sanderson avers[35] that \"the influence of\r\nenvironment on organisms such as bacteria is so great that it seems as\r\nif it were paramount.\" Buchner, Grawitz, Greenfield, Pasteur, Wernich,\r\nThorne, Willems, Law, Wood, and Formad report experiments making it\r\nappear that modification by culture is possible with bacilli and\r\nmicrococci, converting an innocent into a malignant parasitic\r\norganism, or a death-producing microbe into one capable only of\r\ncausing {146} a transitory and not dangerous local affection; which\r\nnevertheless secures to the animal thus treated immunity when\r\nsubsequently exposed to the deadly infection. Most interesting have\r\nbeen the successes with such culture-inoculations obtained by Buchner,\r\nGreenfield, and Pasteur with anthrax in sheep; by Pasteur also in\r\nchicken cholera; and by Willems and Law[36] with the lung-plague of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Brit. Med. Journal_, Jan. 16, 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _N.Y. Med. Record_, June 18, 1881, p. 679. Exposure to\r\nthe air for a considerable period seems to be the agency chiefly\r\nrelied upon for what may be called the dynamic modification of these\r\nmicrophytes. When cultivated in the depth of a liquid, so that air is\r\nexcluded, they are supposed to acquire a habit of obtaining oxygen by\r\ndecomposing organic substances, and thus act destructively upon the\r\ncell-elements of living bodies. Analogous differences have long since\r\nbeen observed in the study of fermentation between surface and\r\nsedimentary yeast.]\r\n\r\nIn none of these cases is there reported any morphological change\r\nwhatever in the bacillus (Grawitz) or micrococcus (Wood and Formad);\r\nthe change in the effects noted, and, in the case of the micrococci of\r\nmalignant diphtheria, the acquired capacity of reproduction through\r\nseveral generations, are all.\r\n\r\n8. The immunity against subsequent attacks on exposure (similar to the\r\nprotection given by vaccination) continues to be without full\r\nexplanation upon any theory. But it is especially difficult to\r\nreconcile it with the hypothesis of the infection being caused by, and\r\ndependent upon, the presence of peculiar microphytes. Why should not\r\nthese, whether as parasites or as poisons, always produce the same\r\neffects?\r\n\r\n9. The view entertained by Thorne, Wood, and Formad, that a common\r\nbenignant affection, such as ordinary sore throat, may be converted\r\ninto a violent infectious disease--_e.g._ malignant diphtheria--by\r\nmodification of innocent micrococci into those with lethal characters,\r\nthrough local or bodily conditions, is sufficiently contravened by the\r\ngreat frequency of such conditions compared with the decided relative\r\nrarity of such malignant epidemics or endemics.\r\n\r\n10. Throughout all the investigations which have been, and are likely\r\nto be, conducted, there remains the extreme difficulty, if not\r\nimpossibility, of total separation between the microbes themselves and\r\nthe matter of the vehicle in which they exist--the membrane, urine,\r\nblood, virus, artificial culture-material, or whatever it may be. All\r\nthe effects ascribable to the disease germs may be, with no more\r\ndifficulty, attributed to the toxic action {147} of a portion, however\r\nminute, of the soil in which they have lived, whose modifications must\r\nbe concomitant with those which they undergo. It appears necessary,\r\ntherefore, at the present time, to regard this whole question as still\r\nundecided, with a predominance of probability, however, in favor of\r\nthe view that these minute organisms, or some of them, have a direct\r\nand important relation of some kind to the causation of specific\r\nendemic, epidemic, and contagious diseases. Altogether, the strongest\r\narguments are on the side of the view that the micrococci, bacilli,\r\netc. cause diseases, not as parasites, living upon their victims, but\r\nas poison-producers infecting them.[37] The germ theory continues to\r\nbe in the position of a probable hypothesis, not in that of an\r\nestablished doctrine of etiological science.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: This comports much the best with the general natural\r\nhistory of parasites on the one hand, and of venoms, ptomaïnes, etc.\r\non the other. Gautier, Ogston, and others have expressed the opinion\r\nthat microphytes may produce ptomaïnes.]\r\n\r\nPractically, the result is nearly the same as if it were altogether\r\nsettled, since it is admitted on all sides that the presence of\r\nmicrophytes (bacteria, micrococci, spirilla) coincides with those\r\nconditions under which originate several of the most malignant\r\ndiseases. Measures which prevent the appearance or promote the\r\ndestruction of these minute organisms are at least often, and to a\r\ngreat degree, preventive, if not curative, of such disorders; and the\r\nglory of Jenner's discovery, by which the ravages of small-pox have\r\nbeen made (potentially at least) controllable, seems not unlikely to\r\nbe paralleled by the achievements of Pasteur and others in a similar\r\npreventive mastery over other maladies of men and animals. There is,\r\ntherefore, no branch of inquiry in connection with medical science\r\nmore worthy of being assiduously encouraged and extended. The present\r\nmay almost be said to be, in the history of medicine, an era of\r\nmyco-pathology.\r\n\r\nFor an exhaustive study of Etiology attention would now have to be\r\ngiven to the modifying influences affecting the occurrence and\r\ncharacter of diseases in connection with age, sex, and temperament.\r\nBut, as neither of these is ever, per se, causative of any malady, and\r\nthey merely determine some modification of the action of morbid causes\r\nwhen these occur, want of space must be our justification for leaving\r\nthem to be considered, in this work, in connection with the special\r\ncausation of the different {148} diseases which will be hereafter\r\ndescribed. A larger treatment of our present subject belongs rather to\r\nhygiene than to practical medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the medical practitioner all professional studies\r\nunite to the end of furnishing preparation for the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of diseases. At the bedside the cardinal questions are, How\r\ndoes the present condition of our patient differ from health? and,\r\nWhat ought we to do to bring about his recovery?\r\n\r\nDiagnosis involves three main directions of inquiry: 1, as to the\r\ngeneral bodily state of the patient; 2, morbid changes in particular\r\norgans, tissues, or functions; 3, as to what name properly designates\r\nthe disorder, according to accepted nomenclature.\r\n\r\nPathology can never be out of view in connection with either the\r\ntheoretical or the practical study of diagnosis. But it is most\r\nclosely regarded when the last of these questions is before us, since\r\nthe names of diseases generally have a more or less distinct reference\r\nto their pathological nature. Yet clinical observation always suggests\r\nthe early use of provisional terms for recognized groupings of morbid\r\nphenomena; and sometimes these clinical designations remain for a long\r\ntime in use because of the imperfection of pathology.\r\n\r\nWe ascertain, in practice, the nature of a given case, first, by\r\nconsidering its symptoms. These are those obvious evidences of\r\ndeviation from health which the patient himself is aware of, or which\r\nthe physician readily discerns or elicits by simple inquiry or\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nSecondly, taking the clue furnished by symptoms, a closer inspection\r\nis made, with the intent of finding what is the actual state of\r\nimportant organs, as the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and\r\nalimentary canal.\r\n\r\nLastly, when these means fail to remove all obscurity, or when special\r\nscientific investigation is practicable, instruments of precision are\r\nemployed, as the thermometer, sphygmograph, ophthalmoscope,\r\næsthesiometer, or aspirator; or by the microscope and chemical\r\nanalyses still more minute examination is made into the particulars of\r\nthe morbid processes present and their results.\r\n\r\nWe may subdivide diagnosis, then, into: 1, symptomatology; 2,\r\norganoscopy or physical diagnosis; 3, instrumental diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatology.\r\n\r\nSemeiology (from [Greek: sêmeion], a sign) is a term much in use, with\r\nessentially the same meaning as symptomatology, but less conveniently\r\ndistinctive, since it does not so well indicate the contrast between\r\nobvious signs, or symptoms, and those more recondite, obtained by the\r\nmethods of physical diagnosis.\r\n\r\nSigns of disease cannot be recognized as such except by one who is\r\n{149} familiar with the appearances, actions, and manifestations which\r\nbelong to health. Nor can they be understood, so as to infer what they\r\nmean, without knowledge of normal physiology on the one hand, and, on\r\nthe other, of the natural history of diseases. Physiology constitutes\r\nthe etymological grammar, symptomatology the vocabulary, and diagnosis\r\nthe syntax of practical medicine. Just as grammatical knowledge will\r\nnot enable any one to read or speak a language without acquaintance\r\nwith its words, so clinical observation is necessary to the physician\r\nover and above all the knowledge he may have of physiology and\r\npathology. He must learn to know diseases by sight, or at least by\r\npersonal contact and observation.\r\n\r\nEvery one has, of course, a general familiarity with the state and\r\nactions of his own and other bodies in health, yet a more exact\r\nknowledge of the movements of respiration, circulation, secretion,\r\netc., as well as the form, size, and relative location of all the\r\norgans of the body, is needed. Physiology and medical anatomy furnish\r\nsuch information. The more thorough this knowledge is appropriated,\r\nthe better fitted the student is for practical diagnosis. For its\r\napplication, however, cultivation of all the perceptive powers is very\r\nimportant. Some men have a genius for quick and clear discernment of\r\nsymptoms and for their interpretation, as well as for that of physical\r\nsigns. But all can much improve their senses, and their sagacity in\r\nusing them, by experience. For this, if for no other reason,\r\nscientific training, in field or laboratory studies, affords the best\r\nintroduction to the work of the medical student and physician. The\r\ntraits most needed for success in diagnosis are exactness and\r\ncomprehensiveness. First, to be sure precisely what each sign is that\r\ncomes under observation; next, to overlook no existing symptoms or\r\nphysical signs; and, last, so to combine them into a mental map,\r\ndiagram, or picture, as to make a coherent and rational whole. This\r\nnosogram may then be compared with the descriptions of standard\r\nauthorities, to find its place (if it has one) in technical\r\nclassification. First, however, ascertain the thing, the morbid state\r\nor combination of states; afterward the name, or morbid species, when\r\npracticable. It is always to be remembered that complication of\r\ndiseases, or at least the existence of some irregular manifestations\r\nalong with those which are characteristic, is more common than the\r\noccurrence of purely typical cases. The portraits of most diseases in\r\nthe books are averages, like the composite class-photographs of\r\nDouglas Galton. Not nearly every case will correspond with such an\r\naverage in all respects. Moreover, so great is the possible variety of\r\nalterations among the different organs of the body that the chances of\r\ntwo instances of disease being precisely alike in every particular are\r\nhardly greater than those in favor of every move being the same in two\r\ngames of chess with the same opening.\r\n\r\nIn an essay like the present it is not easy to decide upon the best\r\nmanner of treating the subject before us. Too much or too little may\r\nbe said. With advanced readers the whole history of symptoms and\r\nphysical signs might be left to the special discussions occurring in\r\narticles upon different diseases. But it may be taken for granted that\r\nthose who consult the present work will do so either at a\r\ncomparatively early stage of their studies or when time has made\r\ndesirable a renewal of what may have been once known and then\r\nforgotten. Since, then, it is impossible {150} to anticipate what may\r\nbe the exact needs of either class, a somewhat elementary statement of\r\nmain facts appears justifiable here.\r\n\r\nFollowing the natural method, we may suppose a call to visit a\r\npatient. Arriving in his presence, the first question (mostly left out\r\nof view and rarely expressed) may be, Is it a case of real or only\r\nimaginary indisposition? Army medical officers, more than most others,\r\ncan appreciate the possibility of this inquiry sometimes disposing of\r\nthe whole case.\r\n\r\nSupposing it to be real, is it an illness or an accident or other\r\ninjury? Is it severe or of trifling account? Acute or chronic? We\r\nobserve the position of the patient, lying quietly in bed, sitting up,\r\nor walking restlessly about the room. Then the countenance is\r\nobserved--pale or flushed, tranquil or excited in expression. We feel\r\nthe forehead, touch the cheek and hand. Is the skin hot or cold, dry\r\nor moist? The pulse is felt; the breathing also is counted.\r\n\r\nOf the patient himself or of another (in serious acute cases better of\r\nhis care-taker, in another apartment) we ask questions whose answers\r\ngive us the general history of the case. When not before known these\r\nshould include his antecedent personal history, even extending to that\r\nof the family, as far as can be learned. What tendencies have they, or\r\nhas he or she, shown by previous attacks and their results?\r\n\r\nSo we come to the present attack: When did it begin, and how? What\r\nhave been its prominent symptoms since? Questions are then to be put\r\nconcerning the heat of the body, appetite, complaint of pain, sleep,\r\nmovement of the bowels, discharge of urine: in the female,\r\nmenstruation; if married, pregnancy or parturition, how often and when\r\noccurring last. Thus the practitioner is enabled to get a clue to the\r\ndiagnosis, to be followed out through his own observation and closer\r\nexamination. If the patient be a child and the attack be acute and\r\nfebrile, an early question must be as to its having passed or not\r\nthrough the different diseases of childhood--viz. the exanthemata,\r\nmumps, and whooping cough, and also what exposure to any of these it\r\nmay have been recently subjected to.\r\n\r\nGoing farther into particulars, let us review some of the possible\r\ndevelopments obtained in the above questioning of symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhen lying in bed the decubitus may be significant, as, upon the back\r\nwith the knees drawn up in peritonitis; with the hands pressing the\r\nabdomen in colic; tossing to and fro in the delirium of fever or of\r\nearly cerebral inflammation; on one side constantly in acute\r\ninflammation of the liver or in pleurisy. Or the patient may be\r\nobliged to be propped in a sitting posture (orthopnoea) from\r\nheart-disease, asthma, or ascites, or leaning forward upon the back of\r\na chair or a pillow with aneurism of the aorta. More remarkable still\r\nmay be the subsultus tendinum of low fever, the opisthotonos of\r\ntetanus, the respiratory spasms of hydrophobia, or the clonic\r\nmovements of epileptic, hysterical, or occasional convulsions.\r\n\r\nIn the face we see pallor in syncope and in anæmia in any of its\r\nvarieties and with varied associations; a general redness in some\r\ncases of apoplexy and in remittent fever; flushing of the forehead and\r\neyes especially in yellow fever; dusky redness in typhus, and a more\r\npurple hue in typhoid fever; yellowness in jaundice, in some cases of\r\nremittent and in most of yellow fever; sallowness in cancer; a bright\r\ncentral glow upon each cheek in early pneumonia or the hectic of\r\nphthisis; a blue or ashen appearance in the collapse of cholera, and\r\nblackish-blue in {151} cyanosis or carbonic acid poisoning; bronzed in\r\nAddison's disease; puffy about the eyelids in Bright's disease; the\r\nsurface swollen, yet resistant to the touch, in myxoedema. The eyes\r\n(one or both) glare prominently in exophthalmic goitre; squint in\r\nadvanced cerebro-meningitis; roll to and fro often in the prostration\r\nof cholera infantum and in convulsions; are clear and bright in\r\nphthisis; yellowish in hepatic disorder; dull and clouded in low\r\nfevers; without expression in imbecility and general paralysis.\r\n\r\nContraction of the pupil is observed in inflammation of the retina or\r\nof the brain, narcotism from opium (until near death) or eserine, or\r\napoplectic effusion near the pons varolii. Dilatation of the pupil is\r\nseen in most cases of hydrocephalus and of apoplexy; in\r\nnerve-blindness (amaurosis), glaucoma, cataract, and narcotism from\r\natropia, duboisia, or hydrocyanic acid. Inactivity of the pupil\r\n(Argyll Robertson) under changes of light and darkness is common in\r\nlocomotor ataxia. Different states of the two pupils under the same\r\nlight show disorder, either ophthalmic or cerebral in site, or may\r\nindicate pressure on the cervical sympathetic ganglia, as from aortic\r\naneurism.\r\n\r\nIn elderly persons we ought always to look for the arcus senilis,\r\nwhich is a sign of a tendency to fatty degeneration. It is a ring, or\r\npart of a ring, with ill-defined edges, best seen by lifting or\r\ndepressing an eyelid, at the junction of the cornea and sclerotic coat\r\nof the eye. In some quite healthy old persons there may be seen at the\r\nsame junction a clearly-defined circular line of calcareous nature.\r\nThis must be distinguished from the true fatty arcus senilis.\r\n\r\nOf the face we may also notice the pinched nose, hollow eyes, and\r\nfalling jaw of the facies Hippocratica, presaging death; the square\r\nforehead of the rickety child (not common in this country); ulcers on\r\nthe forehead, scars at the mouth-corners, or copper-colored eruptions\r\nin syphilis; the full, flabby lips of scrofula. In peritonitis or\r\ngastritis the mouth is apt to be drawn up with a peculiar expression\r\nof suffering and nausea. Very striking is the characteristic one-sided\r\nappearance in facial palsy, from lesion of the seventh nerve. There\r\nmay be a smile, a frown, or other expression on the sound side of the\r\nface, while the paralyzed side is quite immovable. As the seventh\r\nnerve (portio dura) supplies the orbicularis muscles, its paralysis\r\n(so often temporary) may cause inability to close the eye upon the\r\naffected side. Ptosis, or inability to open the eye, involving the\r\nlevator palpebræ, which is innervated by the third nerve (motor oculi)\r\nis more significant of cerebral lesion.\r\n\r\nEven the ears may have language, as when their lobes are full and\r\nglistening red in the gouty diathesis, or wrinkled in prolonged\r\ncachexiæ, or when they are running with discharges in the struma\r\n(scrofula) of childhood. The hair becomes dry and lustreless in\r\nphthisis, and falls out during convalescence from many acute diseases.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the gums in a case of lead-poisoning, we may expect to\r\nfind a blue line along their edges. Scurvy is betokened by a swollen,\r\nspongy, and easily-bleeding state of the gums. Many scorbutic cases,\r\nhowever, lack this so-called pathognomonic feature. It may be\r\nremarked, by the way, that absolutely pathognomonic signs of\r\nparticular diseases, never absent and exclusively seen in them, are\r\nvery few. Albuminuria, for example, is not always present in Bright's\r\ndisease, and is {152} also met with in a number of other affections.\r\nSugar in the urine may follow inhalation of chloroform or an attack of\r\ncholera, as well as diabetes mellitus. Rice-water discharges may be\r\nabsent in the collapse of cholera, and patients may die with yellow\r\nfever without black vomit. Still, these symptoms have great diagnostic\r\nvalue, and, taken with others associated with them, may often enable\r\nus to attain to a diagnosis of much importance.\r\n\r\nPerfect teeth in an adult in this country are rather the exception\r\nthan the rule. In the notched incisors of inherited syphilis, however,\r\nthere is something quite distinctive. The notches in Hutchinson's\r\nteeth are vertical, not horizontal.\r\n\r\nOld as medicine is the examination of the tongue in disease. It may be\r\nprotruded with difficulty, as in low fevers, in apoplexy, and in\r\ncerebral paralysis (bulbar sclerosis, glosso-labio-pharyngeal\r\nparalysis) or thrust to one (the paralyzed) side in hemiplegia. It is\r\npallid in anæmia; yellow in bilious disorder; red in glossitis (then\r\nswollen also), in scarlet fever, and in gastritis; furred in\r\nindigestion, gastro-hepatic catarrh, and the early stage of various\r\nfebrile attacks; dry, brown, cracked, or fissured in typhus or typhoid\r\nfevers and in the typhoid state of malarial remittent fever; bare of\r\nepithelium in advancing phthisis and in imperfect convalescence from\r\nsevere acute diseases. Coldness of the tongue is one of the worst\r\nsigns in the collapse of cholera.\r\n\r\nAs we examine the throat internally we look for signs of faucial\r\ninflammation in redness and swelling, with or without enlargement of\r\nthe tonsils, or relaxation and elongation of the uvula, or ulceration,\r\nor the gray or brown membranous deposit of diphtheria. In the mouth of\r\na child we may find the little white vesicular patches called aphthæ,\r\nthe curd-like exudations of thrush, or possibly the much worse grayish\r\nulcerations of cancrum oris, or the rarer ashen sloughs of gangrene of\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\nOutside of the throat we must remember the significance of glandular\r\nswellings or scars of suppurated glands in children; nor overlook, if\r\npresent, stiffness of the muscles, or torticollis, or goitrous\r\nenlargement of the thyroid gland. Observation should be made also of\r\nthe site of the carotid artery on each side, and of the jugular veins,\r\nsince aortic regurgitation may be indicated by violent action of those\r\narteries or tricuspid regurgitation by pulsation of the veins in the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nLong before vaso-motor physiology had any place in science the pulse\r\nwas known to afford valuable indications in disease. Either of the\r\naccessible arteries will answer instead of the radial; its convenience\r\nmerely makes the wrist the common place of comparison. By careful\r\nexamination of the pulse something may be learned of several of the\r\nfactors concerned in its production. These factors are--1, the\r\nmuscular force of the walls of the heart; 2, the state of the cardiac\r\nvalves; 3, the muscularity of the arteries; 4, the elasticity of the\r\narterial coats; 5, the state of the capillary circulation; 6, the\r\nqualities of the blood; 7, the condition of the nervous system as to\r\nexcitability or apathy.\r\n\r\nA feeble heart must induce a feeble pulse. Moderate debility may be\r\nattended by slowness of the pulse, but usually a weak circulation is\r\nmarked by frequent, small beats, like the vibrations of a short\r\npendulum. A strong heart-beat (other things being equal) is relatively\r\nslow, with a proportionate pause after the second sound.\r\n\r\n{153} Valvular lesions produce various effects upon the pulse. Most\r\nnotable are the irregularity connected often with mitral insufficiency\r\nand the jerking pulse (Corrigan) of aortic regurgitation.\r\n\r\nBelieving, as the present writer does, in the existence of a true\r\narterial systole following and supplementing the ventricular\r\ncontraction,[38] it must be urged that a vigorous muscularity in the\r\narteries promotes strength in the pulse--not by resistance, but by\r\nauxiliary propulsion of the blood. Another condition altogether is\r\ntonic, spasmodic contraction of the arteries. This is not often met\r\nwith pure and simple, but a measure of it is seen in the corded or\r\nwiry pulse of acute enteritis or peritonitis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: This view, although advocated by Sir Charles Bell,\r\nLegros and Onimus, Hermann of Zurich, and others, is opposed to the\r\nmost prevailing vaso-motor physiology. Several complications and some\r\ncontradictions in pathological discussion at the present time would be\r\ncleared up by the abandonment of the now commonly-held stopcock theory\r\nof arterial function, which has really nothing whatever to support it\r\nexcept the misinterpretation of some experiments upon arteries made\r\nmany years since.]\r\n\r\nDeficient elasticity of the arteries is not easily separated in\r\nobservation from muscular relaxation. When arteries undergo\r\ndegeneration (atheromatous, fatty, or calcareous), their middle coat\r\nsuffers the deterioration of both elastic and muscular tissues, these\r\nbeing substituted by materials either more or less yielding, and\r\nalways less resilient, than the natural fabric of the vessels.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the condition of the capillary circulation upon that\r\nof the arterial system and the heart is manifest in inflammations. By\r\nreflex excitation the arteries are made to contract actively and impel\r\nthe blood more forcibly than in the normal state toward the centre of\r\nimpeded nutrition (stasis). This has been abundantly proved by the\r\ncomparison of the amount of blood flowing through the arteries of a\r\nsound limb and those of its fellow, when the latter is the seat of a\r\nviolent acute inflammation.\r\n\r\nBlood-states also affect the pulse by the differences in direct\r\nstimulation to which the heart and arteries are subjected according to\r\nthe qualities and composition of the blood. It is probable that the\r\nfever-pulse of typhus, typhoid, the exanthemata, septicæmia, and\r\npyæmia has its origin in morbid conditions of the blood, acting in a\r\ntwofold manner--directly upon the heart and arteries themselves, and\r\nmediately through the vaso-motor ganglia.\r\n\r\nLastly, the nervous system stands in an important relation to the\r\naction of the heart and arteries, and thus to the pulse. In a nervous,\r\nexcitable person, changes in the rate of the pulse may take place,\r\nwith slight significance, which in a different constitution might be\r\nof serious import.\r\n\r\nTo understand the language of the pulse care must be taken in several\r\nrespects:\r\n\r\n1. Both wrists should be felt. Sometimes there is an abnormal\r\nvariation in the course of the main radial trunk which may pass over\r\nthe thumb. Again, an aneurism may cause a great difference between the\r\ntwo radial pulses, or, possibly, an embolus may occlude one of the\r\nradial vessels, annulling its pulsation.\r\n\r\n2. Other arteries also, especially the carotids, should be\r\nexamined--in all obscure cases at least. Visibly beating, distended,\r\nand tortuous temporal arteries are occasionally met with. They are not\r\npathognomonic of any one malady, although often referred to the gouty\r\ndiathesis. They {154} may attend irregular malarial attacks, or may be\r\nconnected simply with a hyperæmic state of the brain.\r\n\r\n3. The heart's impulse should always be compared with the arterial\r\npulsation. The former may be strong and regular, while the latter is\r\nsmall, feeble, or intermittent. Something must then be wrong, either\r\nin the aortic valves or in the arterial system.\r\n\r\n5. On account of possible nervous agitation, the pulse should usually\r\nbe examined more than once, during each visit to the patient.\r\n\r\n6. Sex, age, position of the body, and time of day must all be taken\r\naccount of. In men the average rate of the pulse is between 65 and 75\r\nper minute; in women, between 70 and 80. The pulse-rate of early\r\ninfancy varies from 100 to 120, and is very easily hurried. That of\r\nold persons is commonly between 60 and 70, until, at a very advanced\r\nage, with debility, its frequency may be increased, especially upon\r\nexertion. Lying down, we find the slowest pulse; sitting, somewhat\r\nmore rapid; and most so in the standing position. In health the time\r\nof day makes no constant difference apart from the effects of food and\r\nexercise. In disorders attended by fever there are important changes\r\nto be regularly observed. Excepting the variable paroxysms of\r\nremittent and intermittent, which are a law unto themselves, in\r\nfebrile affections the pulse may be expected to be slowest in the\r\nmorning and most excited in the early part of the night. A diminution\r\nof this difference is a favorable sign. Sleep generally slows the\r\npulse decidedly. The ordinary statement is, that the pulse is always\r\nslower during sleep, but I have several times found that in states of\r\nexhaustion without fever it may be considerably more rapid while the\r\npatient is asleep. Nothing is more sure to increase the strength and\r\nrapidity of the pulse than high temperature.\r\n\r\n7. Very important is the relation between the pulse and respiration.\r\nNormally, four pulsations occur to each respiratory act. In pulmonary\r\naffections, while the circulation is often disturbed pari passu with\r\nthe breathing, it may be quite otherwise. Great acceleration of the\r\nrate of breathing, with little increase in the rapidity of the pulse,\r\nshould lead us to suspect disease involving the respiratory organs.\r\nConversely, a much hurried or otherwise perturbed pulse, with little\r\nor no change in the breathing, points toward the heart as either\r\nfunctionally or organically the seat of disorder.\r\n\r\nLet us further consider, briefly, the kinds of pulse to be met with\r\nand interpreted in practice.\r\n\r\nA natural pulse is always, per se, a good sign. Yet in the history of\r\na disease usually so well marked as yellow fever some fatal cases have\r\nbeen recorded (walking cases) in which the pulse, almost to the last,\r\nwas natural.\r\n\r\nStrength of the pulse, to a certain degree, belongs to it normally.\r\nBut this is often exaggerated, and we may have the strong, hard, full,\r\nperhaps bounding, pulse of an inflammatory affection (of the brain,\r\nfor example, or of the joints in acute rheumatism) in a person of\r\nvigor. A bounding pulse often accompanies mere palpitation of the\r\nheart, whose source may be the sympathetic influence of indigestion or\r\nnervousness. A similar pulse is apt to be constantly present in\r\nhypertrophy of the heart. In this case it is made more forcible as\r\nwell as more rapid by {155} active exertion; while palpitation,\r\nwithout organic trouble, is usually diminished by moderately active\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nA full pulse is not always strong, nor is a small pulse necessarily\r\nweak. Mention has been made already of the tense, corded pulse met\r\nwith in acute peritonitis, and sometimes in enteritis. Gastric\r\ninflammation, with nausea, may exhibit a depressed pulse, weak and but\r\nlittle accelerated. Under still other circumstances we may find a full\r\npulse which is soft, easily compressible, even gaseous. Most\r\nfrequently a feeble pulse is rapid, and a very rapid pulse is weak.\r\nSlowness, in marked degree, attends apoplexy, opium narcotism, and\r\nfracture of the skull compressing the brain. Functional disturbance of\r\nthe heart may occasionally exceed in effect these causes of\r\nretardation. I have met, under such circumstances, with a pulse of 20\r\nin the minute; one of 18 has been recorded. A few apparently healthy\r\npersons have habitually a pulse with but 40 or 50 beats in the minute.\r\n\r\nQuickness in each beat may occur, while a long interval makes the rate\r\nper minute slow. The jerking pulse of aortic regurgitation is the most\r\nremarkable example of this. Galabin asserts that without imperfection\r\nof the valves of the aorta a decidedly abrupt pulse may attend great\r\nlowering of arterial tension. Something of the same kind may be\r\nnoticed in the temporarily excited pulse of very nervous subjects\r\nunder agitation.\r\n\r\nDicrotism, or reduplication of the pulse-beat, is not uncommon in\r\ntyphus and typhoid fever. Here relaxation of the heart as well as of\r\nthe blood-vessels appears to allow a momentary interruption in the\r\nsuccession of the arterial upon the cardiac systole.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: An exceptional phenomenon, noticed by a few observers,\r\nis the recurrent pulse; _i.e._ a pulsation felt below the finger,\r\nwhose pressure interrupts the flow of blood through an artery. It may\r\nbe explained by supposing unusual fulness of the vessels (local, if\r\nnot general) with, at the same time, relaxation of their walls;\r\nbearing in mind, also, the manner of anastomosis of the radial and\r\nulnar branches which favors recurrence.]\r\n\r\nIntermittence and irregularity of the pulse are not exactly the same\r\nthing. Occasional intermittence may be merely a nervous symptom or a\r\nmuscular twitch of the heart, like the twitches now and then occurring\r\nwithout significance in voluntary muscles. Persistent intermittence,\r\nwith feebleness of the pulsations (these being generally somewhat\r\nrapid), is among the signs of dilatation of the heart.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for intermittence of the radial pulse to accompany\r\nregularity in the heart-beat. This usually results from narrowing\r\n(stenosis) of the aortic valvular outlet from the left ventricle. Only\r\na certain number of impulses fairly reach the more distant arteries.\r\nThis symptom may result also from fatty degeneration of the heart.\r\n\r\nAbsence of pulse in one radial vessel, while it is present in the\r\nother, shows the presence of an obstacle to the circulation on one\r\nside, which may be an aneurism, or an embolus plugging the artery.\r\n\r\nIrregularity of the pulse, a total derangement of its rhythm, while\r\nnot often important in young children, is a serious symptom at other\r\ntimes of life. In one disease most common in childhood, acute\r\nhydrocephalus, the pulse in the first stage is apt to be hard and\r\nrapid, in the middle stage slow and tolerably full, in the third\r\nrapid, feeble, and often irregular. Mitral disease frequently presents\r\nconsiderable irregularity of the pulse; and so does dilatation, even\r\nwithout mitral lesion. Brain trouble, especially late in life, whether\r\nstructural or functional, may produce the {156} same symptom. B. W.\r\nRichardson has pointed this out as one of the effects of the excessive\r\nuse of tobacco, even in young persons.\r\n\r\nThe pulse of continued, relapsing, and remittent fevers is, during the\r\nfebrile exacerbation, rapid (100 to 120); in the earlier part of the\r\nattack full, but only moderately hard, or even soft and yielding. As\r\nthe attack passes its height and critical defervescence occurs, the\r\npulse grows slower, unless great prostration has supervened; in which\r\ncase it increases in rapidity, while it fails more and more in fulness\r\nand resistance.\r\n\r\nThe pulse of the moribund state is nearly always small, very rapid\r\n(130-150), and thready, without force or fulness. It may become\r\nimperceptible before death. A pulse of 140 beats in the minute is\r\nalways alarming; if much beyond that rate the case is desperate. A\r\npulse of more than 150 beats in the minute is very difficult to count\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\nExophthalmic goitre is attended characteristically by a full, somewhat\r\nrapid, and bounding pulse, the cardiac impulse being also\r\nproportionately violent and extended. Exercise much increases this\r\nhyper-pulsation.\r\n\r\nPulsation of the jugular veins is ordinarily explained by tricuspid\r\nregurgitation, a portion of the blood being sent back to the vena cava\r\nwith an impulse reaching to the jugulars. In some instances, however,\r\nas the writer has repeatedly observed, jugular pulsation takes place\r\nwithout any abnormality in the action or condition of the heart, from\r\na local inflammation (as tonsillitis) causing a marked exaggeration of\r\nthe muscular contractility resident in the larger veins.\r\n\r\nRetardation of the flow of blood through the veins is manifest during\r\nthe collapse of epidemic cholera. On pressing the blood back in a vein\r\nupon the hand, for example, and then lifting the finger, instead of\r\nthe movement being, as in health, too swift to be seen, it is so slow\r\nas to be easily followed.\r\n\r\nCapillary movement may be estimated in a similar manner. If it be very\r\nsluggish, pressure upon the cheek, forehead, or hand will cause a\r\npallor which remains for some seconds, instead of disappearing at once\r\nwhen the pressure is withdrawn. This is, it may be noticed, entirely\r\ndifferent from the pitting upon pressure, without much if any change\r\nof color, in local oedema or general anasarcous effusion. The tache\r\nméningitique of Trousseau is a pink or rose-red line left for a time\r\nafter drawing the finger across the forehead or abdomen in cases of\r\nacute hydrocephalus (tubercular meningitis).\r\n\r\nRespiration must be watched carefully in all cases of disease.\r\nNormally, in the adult, while at rest, from 16 to 18 respiratory\r\nmovements occur in each minute. The number is somewhat greater in\r\nwomen, and is considerably increased in children, at birth being about\r\n40 in the minute. Men breathe most by the diaphragm; in women there is\r\na greater lifting of the ribs. In either sex a disorder attended by\r\npain in breathing may modify this proportion. If pleurisy, for\r\nexample, be present, the ribs will be but slightly lifted, abdominal\r\nbreathing taking predominance. When peritonitis makes every movement\r\nof the abdomen painful, costal respiration is maintained almost alone.\r\nLikewise, a unilateral pleurisy or pneumonia will check the\r\nrespiration on the affected side, with an increased movement on the\r\nsound side. This difference is less manifest to the eye than to the\r\near in auscultation. In all febrile {157} affections respiration is\r\nhurried proportionately with the pulse, unless some complicating local\r\ndisorder disturbs the relation.\r\n\r\nDyspnoea may be produced by many different causes, whose possibility\r\nmust be remembered in its interpretation as a means of diagnosis. In\r\nasthma violent efforts are made to compel the entrance of air into the\r\nlungs by the intercostal muscles and diaphragm, aided by all the\r\naccessory muscles of respiration, including the sterno-cleido-mastoid\r\nand others of the neck. Expansion of the nostrils may occur in\r\nsympathy with these efforts. Yet the amount of resistance may be shown\r\nby a partial sinking-in of the lower ribs, as well as by the patient's\r\ndistress. These last signs are sometimes very marked in the collapse\r\nof one or both lungs now and then occurring in whooping cough.\r\n\r\nCroup induces a similar struggle for breath, although the obstruction\r\nis differently located. Early in the croupal attack a hoarse sound may\r\naccompany each inspiration and expiration. Later, when the danger to\r\nlife from apnoea becomes more imminent, a hissing or whistling sound\r\nsucceeds. This last-mentioned kind of sound results temporarily, also,\r\nfrom the spasmodic obstruction to breathing in laryngismus stridulus.\r\n\r\nBesides the affections of the lungs which impede respiration (as\r\npneumonia, hydrothorax, etc.), we may have dyspnoea induced by\r\nextra-pulmonary causes, such as dilatation of the heart, aneurism of\r\nthe aorta, mediastinal cancer, pleuritic effusion; also by abdominal\r\ndropsy, extreme elephantiasis, etc. Mention need hardly be made here\r\nof respiratory obstruction from defective or injurious qualities of\r\nthe air, threatening or producing asphyxia.\r\n\r\nSighing respiration takes place in heart disease not infrequently. A\r\npeculiar modification of the breathing movements has been associated\r\nespecially with fatty degeneration of the heart. From the\r\ndistinguished authors who first described it this is called the\r\nCheyne-Stokes respiration. Intervals of suspension of breathing occur,\r\nafter which short, shallow inspirations begin, and gradually increase\r\nfor a time in depth; then they grow shorter and shallower again, until\r\napnoea is reached. Such a cycle may occupy from half a minute to a\r\nminute and a half, with from fifteen to thirty increasing and\r\ndecreasing respirations in all. It has been shown by several observers\r\nthat this type of respiration is not peculiar to fatty degeneration of\r\nthe heart. It has been met with in cases of cardiac dilatation, aortic\r\natheroma, cerebral hemorrhage, tubercular meningitis, and uræmia.\r\n\r\nSometimes a kind of dyspnoea common in advanced disease of the heart,\r\nespecially in mitral lesion with dilatation, has been confounded with\r\nthis. Here the breathing is constantly labored (orthopnoea); but the\r\npatient from time to time dozes off into an imperfect sleep, in which\r\nthe breathing almost entirely ceases. Then he is awakened with a start\r\nof distress, perhaps out of a painful dream. This succession of dozing\r\napnoea and waking dyspnoea belongs to a late stage of heart disease,\r\nand usually ends in death.\r\n\r\nStertorous respiration is familiar in apoplectic coma, as well as in\r\nthat of brain compression from injury or from opium or alcoholic\r\nnarcotism. In uræmic coma true stertor is less apt to be observed;\r\nsometimes the respiration in this condition has a hissing sound.\r\n\r\nAlong with the movements of respiration we may notice that the breath\r\n{158} is hot and has a heavy odor in the early stages of all febrile\r\ndisorders. Disagreeable breath is common, however, in persons not ill,\r\nfrom bad teeth or from indigestion. It is worst of all, putrid, in\r\ngangrene of the lung. Certain cases of chronic or subacute bronchitis\r\n(as well as of ozæna) also have very offensive breath. Coldness of the\r\nbreath is a very bad sign; it is observed sometimes before death in\r\nthe collapse of cholera.\r\n\r\nHiccough (singultus) is a spasmodic affection of the diaphragm. It is\r\ninnocent, though annoying, in most cases, resulting from indigestion\r\nor from nervous disorder; in children, occasionally, from long crying.\r\nWhen it takes place in cases of general prostration it betokens\r\nthreatening depression or exhaustion of vital energy.\r\n\r\nThe voice is mostly altered by serious disease. It may be feeble and\r\nwhispering, from debility; hoarse, from laryngeal inflammation and\r\ntumefaction; thick, from cerebral oppression; lost (aphonia), in some\r\ncases of chronic laryngitis and in paralysis of the vocal muscles. The\r\nmanner of articulating words is often changed in disorders of the\r\nnervous system. A marked example of this is the monotonous scanning\r\nspeech of cerebro-spinal sclerosis.\r\n\r\nCough is an extremely variable symptom, always to be understood in\r\nconnection with the attendant circumstances. Usually, however, the\r\ncharacter of the cough itself is more or less distinctive. A dry, hard\r\ncough may be merely sympathetic or nervous, or it may belong to the\r\nfirst stage of acute bronchitis. A hacking cough, with little\r\nexpectoration, is not infrequently observed for a time in incipient\r\nphthisis. Pneumonia has, if any, a short and rather sharp cough.\r\nProgressing bronchitis is recognized by the deepening and greater or\r\nless loosening of the cough. In advanced phthisis there are\r\ndistressing spells of deep, laborious coughing, especially in the\r\nnight or in the morning after sleep. Croup is known (whether sporadic\r\nor in the form of laryngeal diphtheria) by the barking cough of the\r\nearly stage and its whistling character toward the fatal end. Nearly\r\nthe same sort of hissing or whistling sound in breathing has been\r\nmentioned already as occurring in laryngismus stridulus. Paroxysms of\r\ncoughing, with or without whooping, are pathognomonic of pertussis.\r\n\r\nExpectoration often affords important signs. Briefly, it may suffice\r\nto say here that it is mucous, whitish, or colorless in early\r\nbronchitis; more or less yellowish and muco-purulent in severe and\r\nprotracted bronchitis; rusty, from admingling of the coloring matter\r\nof blood, in pneumonia, early and middle stages; bloody and\r\nmuco-purulent in early and of heavy roundish (nummular) masses in late\r\npulmonary phthisis; putrid, rotten, in gangrene of the lung.\r\n\r\nContinuing our survey of obvious symptoms, we must now take account of\r\nthe conditions of the general surface of the body. Temperature is of\r\ngreat consequence. Most precisely determinable by the thermometer, the\r\ntouch, when educated, will give very useful indications of its\r\nchanges. It is difficult, and not commonly desirable, to separate\r\nvariations of moisture from those of temperature. Reserving for\r\nanother place the special consideration of medical thermometry, it may\r\nbe here said that the skin is hot and dry in the typical condition of\r\nfever, whatever its special associations. Heat and moisture of the\r\nskin are more often met with together in the fever of acute articular\r\nrheumatism than in any other {159} affection. As a rule, perspiration\r\nlessens febrile heat. Copious (colliquative) sweating is habitual in\r\nmany wasting diseases, notable in pulmonary phthisis. It is then a\r\nsign of great general relaxation of the system.\r\n\r\nColdness of the surface attends prostration, either from temporary\r\ncollapse or from positive exhaustion. The skin is perceptibly cold in\r\nthe algid stage of cholera. It may be so in very severe cases of\r\nsporadic cholera morbus. In the chill of intermittent, while the\r\npatient has the subjective sensation of coldness, his temperature is\r\nseldom reduced, and is often higher than natural, although lower than\r\nduring the febrile exacerbation.\r\n\r\nThe color of the skin is pallid in anæmia, phthisis, dropsy, etc., and\r\nin syncope; ashen or livid in cholera collapse and in the cold stage\r\nof pernicious malarial fever; yellow in jaundice, remittent, and\r\nyellow fever; sallow in chlorosis, cancer, and chronic dyspepsia;\r\npurple, almost black (especially the lips and ends of the fingers), in\r\nasphyxia; dark, as if stained with ink, after long use of nitrate of\r\nsilver; bronzed in Addison's disease; bright red in scarlet fever,\r\netc. The eruptions of this and other exanthemata, and of the different\r\ncutaneous diseases, will be best considered in the special articles\r\ntreating them of in this work.\r\n\r\nOdor is perceptible and peculiar (though not easily described) in some\r\nbad cases of typhus fever and of small-pox; less often in aggravated\r\nchlorosis. Lunatics and paralytics (especially when assembled together\r\nin institutions) often give off a noticeable smell. Most distinct,\r\nhowever, is the cadaverous odor, sometimes perceptible for hours\r\nbefore death. Corroborative of this, in summer, is the flocking of\r\nflies around the bed of a dying patient. In a hospital ward this\r\nselection amongst a number of patients may be quite observable.\r\n\r\nEmphysema, from the presence of air in the connective tissue under the\r\nskin, is rarely met with except as the consequence of an injury or of\r\nlocal gangrene.\r\n\r\nOedema is local watery effusion, which may have various causes and\r\nsignificance. Anasarca must have a general causation, either connected\r\nwith the state of the blood or with disorder of the heart, kidneys, or\r\nliver, or of more than one of those organs at once. Pitting on\r\npressure is the sign of watery effusion. Soft crackling under the\r\ntouch distinguishes emphysema. A firm enlargement of the surface of\r\nthe face and upper part of the body occurs in myxoedema.\r\n\r\nSwellings of all kind must be carefully observed, and their nature\r\ninquired into--whether they be inflammatory or other chronic\r\nenlargements of joints, tumors, fibrous, fatty, or cancerous,\r\naneurisms, hernial protrusions, or of any other character. In\r\nprotracted disease of the liver (cirrhosis) it is not uncommon to find\r\nthe superficial abdominal veins dilated and tortuous.\r\n\r\nAbdominal enlargement may result from adipose accumulation (obesity),\r\ndistension of the bowels with wind (meteorism), ascites, ovarian\r\ncysts, cancerous or other tumors, aneurism of the aorta, abscess,\r\nretention of urine, or pregnancy. By the methods of physical\r\ndiagnosis, along with careful inquiry into the history of each case,\r\nwe are to make out the distinctions amongst these different\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nEmaciation always marks either defect of nutrition or morbid excess of\r\ntissue-waste. It is counterfeited in the sudden collapse of malignant\r\n{160} cholera, and exaggerated in appearance during the analogous\r\ncondition of cholera infantum. On recovery from these states,\r\nespecially the latter, roundness and fulness of the face and limbs may\r\nreturn much too soon for the actual restoration of fat and flesh. A\r\nyoung child may be plump and chubby to-day, seemingly wasted with\r\nacute illness to-morrow, and, if soon relieved, the next day almost as\r\nrotund as ever.\r\n\r\nContinued diarrhoea, phthisis pulmonalis, mesenteric disease, cancer,\r\nand aneurism of the aorta are among the most frequent causes of great\r\nemaciation. Sometimes, as in progressive pernicious anæmia, we are\r\nstruck with the comparatively slight degree of wasting of the body\r\nwhile the disease is advancing toward death.\r\n\r\nIn myxoedema there is a swelling or general enlargement, especially of\r\nthe upper portions of the trunk. This is not anasarcous, but depends\r\nupon a morbid change in the connective tissue throughout the body.\r\n\r\nArticular enlargements may be (particularly in the knee in children)\r\nscrofulous, or gouty (in the smaller joints), rheumatic, with\r\nevidences of inflammation, acute or chronic; or, what is not well\r\nnamed, rheumatoid arthritis. In this last affection there is a gradual\r\nswelling and stiffening, with but little inflammation, of several,\r\nsometimes all, the joints of the extremities. Locomotor ataxia is in\r\nsome cases attended by a degenerative alteration in one or more of the\r\nlarger joints.\r\n\r\nThe limbs may furnish to the eye many expressive signs of disease or\r\ndisability. In the listlessness of one arm and hand, while the other\r\ncan perform various movements, we see reason to suspect hemiplegia. If\r\nthe fingers are rigidly contracted, as well as powerless, we have this\r\ndiagnosis confirmed, whether the rigidity be early or late in its\r\nstage. We must then look for a similar condition of the lower\r\nextremity on the same side. Paraplegia and general paralysis have\r\ntheir more extended (bilateral) indications in like manner.\r\nCharacteristic also are the wrist-drop, from paralysis of the\r\nextensors of the hand, in lead-palsy; weakness or incapacity of the\r\nflexors and extensors in writer's cramp; the hand fixed helplessly in\r\nthe position for writing in paralysis agitans (advanced stage); the\r\nmain en griffe, with shrunken muscles and drawn tendons, of\r\nprogressive muscular atrophy (wasting palsy). In the legs at first and\r\nchiefly, but in time also in the arms, increase of bulk with loss of\r\npower in the muscles shows the existence of pseudo-hypertrophic\r\nmuscular paralysis.\r\n\r\nGouty fingers have their joints not only swollen, but distorted by\r\ndeposits of urates and carbonates. Clubbed finger-ends, in the adult,\r\nare seen mostly, with incurvation of the nails, in advancing\r\nconsumption. The nails are sometimes striated after attacks of gout,\r\nthe lines disappearing gradually during the interval. In many acute\r\ndiseases, transverse ridges are noticeable on the nails, marking the\r\ndate when their growth was arrested and subsequently resumed. These\r\nare specially remarkable after attacks of relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nA tendency to dropsical effusion is generally first shown, besides a\r\npuffiness of the face, in the feet and ankles, the shoe or slipper\r\nmarking off the enlargement above its margin. Often this has no other\r\ncause than debility, with a watery condition of the blood. Varicose\r\nveins, with old and resultant ulcers, are also among the possible\r\nthings to be found in examination of the legs and feet.\r\n\r\n{161} Movements of the hands are incessant and jerking in chorea;\r\nperpetually trembling in delirium tremens, and often in one arm and\r\nhand only, in paralysis agitans; with tremor, seen in voluntary\r\nmotions alone, in multiple cerebro-spinal sclerosis. More unusual is\r\nthe rhythmical closing and opening of the hand, successively, of\r\nathetosis.\r\n\r\nIn the walk of patients able to be upon their feet there may be much\r\nsignificance. A hemiplegic subject will circumduct the feeble limb\r\nafter the other; one suffering with paraplegia will shuffle the feet\r\nslowly along the floor; the hysterical paralytic drags the lame limb\r\nbehind the other; the patient with spastic spinal paralysis rises on\r\nhis toes in walking, with his legs held close together; the shaking\r\nparalytic rather trots forward, with the body bent; and the subject of\r\nlocomotor ataxia lifts his feet and kicks out forward or sideways,\r\nthen bringing down the heels with a stamp at each step. In progressive\r\nmuscular atrophy and advanced pseudo-hypertrophic muscular paralysis a\r\nwaddling or rolling gait is seen. Choreic patients are very irregular\r\nin their walk, as in all other movements. Hip disease (coxalgia) shows\r\nitself in a child by its lifting the pelvis and limb of the affected\r\nside and bending the knee, so as to touch only the toes to the ground.\r\nClub-foot and other deformities require no description in this place.\r\n\r\nSensibility of the extremities and of other parts of the surface of\r\nthe body needs to be examined into, with all its possible variations\r\n(hyperæsthesia, anæsthesia, analgesiæ, etc.), especially when the\r\nnervous apparatus is for any reason supposed to be involved. Motions\r\nof an unusual character must likewise be carefully noticed.\r\n\"Westphal's symptom\" is regarded as having considerable diagnostic\r\nvalue. It is otherwise called the tendon-reflex, with its\r\nmodifications. When a person in health is seated with one leg crossed\r\nover the other or with the legs dangling over the edge of a high bench\r\nor table, and a sudden blow is struck upon the tendon of the patella,\r\nthe leg and foot will be spontaneously jerked forward. In locomotor\r\nataxia, even from an early period, this tendon-reflex is abolished. In\r\nspastic spinal paralysis (lateral spinal sclerosis) it is exaggerated.\r\nQuite analogous to this is the ankle-clonus. This is obtained by\r\nfirmly flexing the foot and then tapping sharply upon the tendo\r\nAchillis. The foot is then involuntarily extended and flexed several\r\ntimes in succession. There is more doubt in regard to the associations\r\nof this symptom than as to the knee movement, but it has been\r\nclinically shown to be exaggerated in spastic spinal paralysis.\r\n\r\nAt our first acquaintance with a case of disease, while making inquiry\r\ninto its nature, the genital organs must not be forgotten. Not that we\r\nneed always make examination of them, but any pointing in symptoms\r\ntoward them must be borne in mind, so as to guide us in or toward\r\nfurther procedures in diagnosis. In making, in obscure cases, a\r\ndiagnosis by exclusion, we are sometimes driven to a scrutiny of the\r\ngenital system.\r\n\r\nWe have now, however incompletely, touched upon the greater number of\r\nobvious signs or symptoms which a view of a patient would furnish\r\nwithout making minute inquiry of himself or others concerning his or\r\ntheir knowledge of the illness. Such are the objective signs of\r\ndisease, which must be still more exactly and extensively discerned\r\nand understood by means of the processes of physical and instrumental\r\ndiagnosis. {162} But the subjective symptoms also, and all those\r\nobserved and described by the patient and his or her friends, must\r\nreceive very careful attention. Much practical skill may be shown by\r\nthe kind of questions asked and the use made of the answers given.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the alimentary apparatus:\r\n\r\nTaste is very commonly altered in disease, being sour in indigestion,\r\nbitter in disorders of the liver, saltish in hæmoptysis, rotten in\r\ngangrene of the lungs.\r\n\r\nDryness of the mouth is the rule in fevers. Sometimes the saliva is\r\nviscid and adherent. Increased flow or salivation was formerly\r\nfrequent in practice under large doses of mercurials. Jaborandi or its\r\nalkaloid pilocarpin will generally produce it. Iodide of potassium\r\noccasionally has the same effect in less degree.\r\n\r\nLoss of appetite nearly always attends serious diseases of any kind.\r\nExcessive craving for food (bulimia) is rare. Tapeworm accounts for it\r\nin some instances. Desire for strange articles of food, as\r\nslate-pencils, ashes, etc., is met with in some instances of chlorosis\r\nand of hysteria. A return of natural appetite is one of the best signs\r\ntoward the close of any acute attack of illness.\r\n\r\nThirst is seldom absent in fever. It is also usually present in the\r\nstate of collapse, as from cholera, pernicious intermittent, or the\r\nshock of severe (especially railroad) injuries.\r\n\r\nDysphagia or difficulty of swallowing may result from simple debility,\r\nas in the moribund state; inflammation of the fauces, tonsils, or\r\npharynx; stricture of the oesophagus; obstruction by a foreign body or\r\nby a cancerous or aneurismal tumor; retro-pharyngeal abscess;\r\nparalysis of the muscles of the throat, such as sometimes follows\r\ndiphtheria. Soreness of the throat is present in some, but not in all\r\nof these examples of dysphagia, being most marked in the inflammatory\r\ncondition of pharyngitis, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, and diphtheria.\r\nUlceration of the throat should always be carefully looked for, and if\r\npresent investigated to ascertain whether it is simple, diphtheritic,\r\nor syphilitic. We must be careful not to mistake a mere local\r\naccumulation of mucus, or aphthous vesicle, or the curd-like formation\r\nof thrush or muguet, either for ulceration or pseudo-membranous\r\ndeposit. Aphthæ and thrush are most frequently met with in children,\r\nthough small aphthous ulcers frequently appear toward the close of\r\nwasting, and especially cancerous, affections. If there be a doubt,\r\npass a moistened hair pencil lightly over the apparent deposit, or\r\nallow the patient to gargle the throat with water, and then re-inspect\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMany causes may produce nausea and vomiting, which almost always occur\r\ntogether; that is, vomiting rarely takes place without previous\r\nnausea, although the latter may exist without the former. In the\r\nmanner of vomiting there are some differences more or less\r\ncharacteristic, as the distressing retching of sea-sickness and of\r\ntartar emetic or other irritant poisoning, and the spasmodic\r\nout-spurting of rice-water fluid in malignant cholera. The matter\r\nvomited is often very important in diagnosis. In mere indigestion the\r\nfood taken is apt to come up, and the same may happen in flatulent\r\ncolic. When the liver is involved, as in bilious colic, bile also is\r\nejected. Nothing peculiar exists in the ejecta of morning sickness in\r\npregnancy. The ejecta contain mucus in gastritis, blood in ulcer and\r\nin cancer of the stomach, stercoraceous {163} material in obstruction\r\nof the bowels, black vomit in bad cases of yellow fever. Hysterical\r\nvomiting sometimes closely imitates the latter in appearance. Other\r\naffections attended by vomiting are cholera morbus, remittent fever,\r\nbrain disease, Bright's disease of the kidney, etc.\r\n\r\nSpitting blood may be either hæmatemesis or hæmoptysis proper. If the\r\nformer, nausea generally precedes the ejection of the blood by\r\nvomiting, and it is apt to be mingled with food partly digested. It is\r\ncoughed up, bright red and frothy usually, when coming from the lungs\r\nor bronchial tubes. But blood may proceed from the gums or throat, or\r\nmay run back through the posterior nares from the nose, and then it\r\ngives alarm by seeming to proceed from the chest. It is necessary to\r\ninquire very particularly into all such possibilities in every case of\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nBetween vomiting of blood from ulcer and from cancer of the stomach we\r\nhave mostly these distinctions: in ulcer it follows soon after taking\r\nfood, in cancer (this being generally at the pylorus), an hour or more\r\nafter eating; ulcer is attended also by tenderness on pressure at a\r\ncertain spot over the stomach, without tumor; cancer presents a tumor,\r\nwith much less marked tenderness on pressure. By aid of the microscope\r\nin examination of the matter vomited this diagnosis may be completed.\r\n\r\nConstipation is an exceedingly frequent symptom under many and diverse\r\ncircumstances. Pathologically, we account for it in several ways: 1,\r\ntorpor of the muscular coat of the intestinal canal; 2, deficiency of\r\nsecretion in the glands of the bowels and in the liver; 3, imperfect\r\ninnervation of the abdominal organs; 4, mechanical obstruction, as by\r\na foreign body, intussusception, strangulated hernia, cancerous or\r\nother tumor, stricture of the rectum, etc. Dyspeptic persons are\r\nordinarily constipated. So are almost all patients at the beginning of\r\nattacks of measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, and other acute febrile\r\nmaladies. Typhoid fever is scarcely an exception to this; although the\r\nbowels in that affection become loose after a few days, they seldom\r\nare so at the very beginning of the attack. Sea-sickness is commonly\r\naccompanied by total or nearly total inaction of the bowels, the\r\nsecretion of the intestinal glands being almost null, often for many\r\ndays together. Torpor of the brain is sometimes attended by marked\r\nconstipation. The latter may be a contributing cause of the former, as\r\nin certain severe cases of scarlet fever, in which threatening coma\r\nmay be relieved by active purgation. We must not, however, occupy\r\nspace here by attempting to enumerate the many conditions under which\r\nconstipation may present itself as a symptom.\r\n\r\nAlmost as various are the associations of the opposite state of the\r\nbowels, diarrhoea. Excessive or abnormally frequent discharges from\r\nthe bowels may be either fecal, bilious, mucous, membranous, purulent,\r\nbloody, fatty, or watery, and they may occur with or without pain and\r\nstraining (tenesmus).\r\n\r\nIf, with frequent disposition to pass something, only small quantities\r\nof bloody mucus escape, with pain and bearing down, we recognize\r\ndysentery. When, instead, a large quantity of colorless fluid, with or\r\nwithout floating flakes (rice-water), comes from the bowels at short\r\nintervals, with vomiting of the same sort of material, we suspect\r\nepidemic cholera, and must inquire for corroborative or corrective\r\nindications in {164} reference to that suspicion. Very bad cases of\r\ncholera morbus also may, at a late stage, present this symptom. So may\r\nexceptional cases of pernicious malarial fever. The diarrhoea of\r\ntyphoid fever exhibits usually liquid stools of a brownish color\r\n(gutter-water passages). Occasionally, hemorrhage from the bowels adds\r\nto the danger of this fever, as well as to that of malarial remittent\r\nfever. In phthisis pulmonalis, at a late stage, colliquative\r\ndiarrhoea, like colliquative perspirations, shows the breaking up of\r\nthe system by excessive waste. Very foul, offensive discharges from\r\nthe bowels may always be understood as showing that in the alimentary\r\ncanal, whether originating there or in the blood, morbid changes have\r\nbeen going on. The indication is to promote the elimination of such\r\nmaterial as soon and as thoroughly as possible.\r\n\r\nClayey stools show absence or deficiency of bile in the intestines,\r\nwhether from its non-secretion by the liver or from obstruction to its\r\nentrance by a gall-stone in the common gall-duct. Green stools are not\r\nuncommon in sick children. The cause of the color has been much\r\ndisputed. Probably it depends chiefly on a modification of the\r\nbile-pigment, with some admixture of altered blood. When mercurials\r\nhave been taken sulphide of mercury may give a green color to the\r\ndischarges.\r\n\r\nBlood, nearly or quite unmixed, coming from the bowels, may have its\r\norigin in internal hemorrhoids, intestinal ulceration, cancer of the\r\nrectum, intussusception, rupture of an aneurism, typhoid or yellow\r\nfever, or vicarious menstruation.\r\n\r\nPus is discharged per anum in cases of dysenteric or other ulceration\r\nof the bowel; also when an abscess occurring in any part of the\r\nabdomen (most frequently hepatic) opens into the intestine.\r\nPseudo-membranous discharges, shreds or other fragments of fibrinous\r\nmaterial, appear sometimes in what may be called diphtheritic\r\ndysentery. Tubular casts are occasionally seen (diarrhoea tubularis),\r\nwhich, however, are most likely to consist of thickened and\r\naccumulated mucus. Fatty discharges from the bowels are rare. Authors\r\nreport observation of them in cases of disease of the liver or\r\npancreas, as well as in phthisis, typhoid fever, diabetes mellitus,\r\ncholera, and tubercular enteritis of children.\r\n\r\nLientery is the term applied when imperfectly changed food appears in\r\nthe stools. It shows, of course, great deficiency in the process of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nUrination affords symptoms often of extreme consequence in disease.\r\nSuppression of urine is one of the most alarming of signs; an\r\napproximation to it only is likely to be met with in cholera, a late\r\nstage of scarlet fever, typhus or typhoid fever, in acute yellow\r\natrophy of the liver, and in advanced kidney disease. Careful\r\nexamination of the abdomen, by inspection, palpation, and percussion,\r\nas well as by inquiry of attendants, is needful in all cases of fever\r\nor other disorders with delirium or stupor, to ascertain the presence\r\nor absence of retention of urine. Dysuria--_i.e._ difficult urination,\r\nstrangury--may have several causes. Cantharides, absorbed from a\r\nblister, may produce it temporarily. The more continuous states which\r\ncause it are--stricture of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate\r\ngland, and calculus in the bladder. In stricture, when the patient can\r\npass water, it is apt to be in a twisted stream. Dribbling often\r\noccurs when the prostate is enlarged. When a stone is present the\r\n{165} stream may flow naturally for a time and then suddenly cease\r\nfrom obstruction at the outlet of the bladder. Enuresis, incontinence\r\nof urine, is often very troublesome in children; its diagnosis\r\npresents no difficulty.\r\n\r\nDiabetes properly means simply excessive flow of urine. It may be\r\nattended by no change in the secretion except dilution of its solids\r\n(diabetes insipidus), as in certain nervous cases or after very large\r\nimbibition of fluids. More serious is diabetes mellitus, in which\r\nlarge amounts of sugar are found in the urine.\r\n\r\nVariations in the quantity and in the composition and solid\r\ningredients of the urine, as ascertained by aid of chemical analysis\r\nand the microscope, will be fully considered in other portions in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMenstruation in the female requires scrutiny in every case of\r\ndeviation from health. Its abnormities will be elsewhere treated of.\r\nThe subject of the signs of pregnancy belongs of course to treatises\r\non Obstetrics.\r\n\r\nPain is one of the most important of the signs of disease. We must\r\nalways examine its character, location, and associations. As to\r\ncharacter, that of pleurisy is sharp and cutting, increased by deep\r\nbreathing or coughing. In pneumonia and in myalgia it is dull or\r\naching. Rheumatic joints or muscles suffer a gnawing, tearing pain. In\r\nneuralgia it is darting, shooting, lancinating; and the last of these\r\nexpressions is often applied to the pains of cancer. Griping pains\r\noccur in colic, and bearing-down pains in dysentery, as well as in the\r\nsecond stage of labor. Besides these varieties we have the pulsating\r\npain of an acute external inflammation, as of the hand, especially\r\nbefore suppuration has occurred; the burning and smarting of\r\nerysipelas; and the stinging, nettling sensations (formication) of\r\nurticaria.\r\n\r\nTenderness on pressure is significant either of local inflammation,\r\nwhose other signs are then to be discerned, or of non-inflammatory\r\nhyperæsthesia. The origin of the latter may require careful\r\nexamination of various organs for its discovery. If pain is relieved\r\nby pressure, we may be sure of the absence of severe acute local\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the seat of disease may be at some distance from that\r\nof pain, as in the familiar instances of pain at the top of the head\r\nin uterine derangement; in the glans penis from calculus in the\r\nbladder; in the knee from hip-joint disease; under the shoulder-blade\r\nin liver disorder; about the heart or between the shoulders from\r\ndyspepsia.\r\n\r\nAnæsthesia, loss of sensibility, has much value as a symptom in\r\nneurotic affections, as paralysis, etc. Its discussion will find place\r\nin connection with diseases of the Nervous System in other portions of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the diversified associations of pain, cephalalgia\r\n(headache) may be mentioned as having at least the following possible\r\ncauses: congestion of the brain, neuralgia, rheumatism of the scalp,\r\nuterine irritation, disease of the kidneys, early stage of remittent,\r\ntyphoid, or yellow fever, alcoholic intoxication, chronic disease of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nAbdominal pain may, in like manner, be traced, in different cases, to\r\nmany morbid conditions, such as flatulent colic, lead colic, neuralgia\r\nor rheumatism of the bowels, intestinal obstruction, dysentery,\r\npassage of a gall-stone or of a nephritic calculus through one or the\r\nother duct {166} respectively; cancer, aneurism of the aorta, caries\r\nof the spine; in the female, dysmenorrhoea, metralgia or\r\novaralgia--_i.e._ neuralgia of the uterus or ovaries.\r\n\r\nSimilar diversity in the origins of pain might, but for want of space,\r\nbe pointed out in morbid states of the contents of the chest and of\r\nother parts of the body.\r\n\r\nSubjective symptoms often affect the special senses.\r\n\r\nTaste and touch have been already referred to. Of sight we may have\r\nphotophobia, connected with exaggerated sensibility of the retina or\r\nof the brain; muscæ volitantes, specks, rings, or chains of spots from\r\nfloating semi-opaque particles in the vitreous humor; diplopia, double\r\nvision; hemiopia, seeing only half of an object at a time; amblyopia,\r\nindistinctness of vision of all objects.\r\n\r\nHearing is affected, besides all possible degrees of deafness, with\r\nthe subjective sensations of ringing, whistling, or roaring\r\nsounds--tinnitus aurium. One form of this (as I conclude from\r\nobservation in my own ears) depends upon spasmodic vibration of the\r\ntensor tympani or stapedius muscle. Sometimes the seat of the\r\nsensation is in the auditory nervous apparatus proper. It has, not\r\nseldom, a marked connection with brain-exhaustion. An attack of\r\nMenière's disease (labyrinthine vertigo) is often preceded by it. No\r\nconstant signification, however, can be attached to aural tinnitus.\r\nLarge doses of quinine or of salicylic acid will occasion it in many\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nVery briefly, deafness may be here disposed of by mentioning that, in\r\ngreater or less degree, it may be produced by accumulated wax in the\r\near; obstruction of the Eustachian tube; thickness of the membrana\r\ntympani; perforation of that membrane; mucus or pus in the middle ear;\r\ndisease of the ossicles of the ear; paralysis of the auditory nerve;\r\ntyphus or typhoid fever; excessive doses of quinine or salicylic acid.\r\n\r\nVertigo is chiefly of two kinds, dizziness or giddiness (swimming in\r\nthe head), and reeling vertigo, or a disposition to fall or turn to\r\none side or the other. Giddiness is produced by running or whirling\r\nmany times in a circle, or, in some persons, by swinging rapidly or\r\nsailing. Reeling vertigo is mostly observed in connection with\r\ndisorder of the brain or of the labyrinth of the ear (Menière's\r\ndisease). Dizziness, with nausea, is common as a symptom of cholæmia\r\n(cholesteræmia of Flint) in what is popularly called a bilious attack.\r\n\r\nDelirium is present in many acute disorders, and not infrequently at a\r\nlate stage in pulmonary phthisis. Its special study will be taken up\r\nin connection with the special articles upon these affections.\r\n\r\nComa, or stupor, is met with chiefly in the following morbid states:\r\nsevere typhus or typhoid fevers; malignant scarlet fever; small-pox;\r\nrarely in measles; pernicious malarial fever; uræmia; apoplexy; opiate\r\nnarcotism, or that from chloral or alcoholic intoxication; asphyxia\r\nfrom inhaling carbonic acid gas, ether, chloroform, etc.; fracture of\r\nthe skull with compression of the brain.\r\n\r\nFor an account of aphasia and other morbid psychological\r\nmanifestations the reader is referred to the articles on Aphasia,\r\nInsanity, Hysteria, etc. in this work.\r\n\r\nPhysical and Instrumental Diagnosis will be treated in connection with\r\nthose diseases in which they have special importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n{167} PROGNOSIS.\r\n\r\nThe elements of medical prognosis are essentially involved in\r\ndiagnosis. Our ability to anticipate the mode of progress, duration,\r\ntermination, and results of any case of illness depends upon our\r\nknowledge--1, of the nature of the malady, with its tendencies toward\r\ndeath, self-limitation, or indefinite continuance; 2, the soundness or\r\nimperfection of the patient's constitution, with or without special\r\npredispositions or the consequences of previous ailments; 3, the\r\npresent state of his system as to the performance of the general\r\nfunctions, his strength, and vital resistance or persistence; 4, the\r\nprobable modifying influences of medical treatment, and also those of\r\nsituation, surroundings, and nursing--_i.e._ the care of those\r\nattending to the patient during the absence of the physician and\r\nhaving the duty of carrying out his directions.\r\n\r\n1. As to the nature of the malady. While every sickness must be\r\nsupposed to encroach somewhat upon the vital energy of its subject,\r\nvery few diseases (leaving aside deadly poisons and surgical injuries)\r\nare, ab initio, certainly fatal. Hydrophobia (rabies canina) has been,\r\nuntil latterly, regarded as incurable, and always mortal within a few\r\ndays or a week or two. A few cases have, during the last few years,\r\nbeen reported as cured, but the diagnosis of these continues to be\r\nsomewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\nCancer exhibits a tendency to extend its destructive malnutrition so\r\nas to render death inevitable unless it can be removed early and\r\ncompletely, or unless the morbid process can be arrested in some\r\nmanner not yet known. Remedies, such as condurango and Chian\r\nturpentine, which furnished hope of such an effect, have, after\r\nprolonged trial, been abandoned as not justifying the confidence of\r\nthe profession.\r\n\r\nTubercular phthisis was once considered to be almost necessarily a\r\nfatal disease, although with a very indefinite period of duration.\r\nUnder improved hygienic management, with mild palliatives and\r\nrecuperative medication, a not inconsiderable minority of cases now\r\nend in recovery. This term may be properly applied when, with\r\ncicatrization of a cavity or cavities in the lungs, no more tubercle\r\nis deposited and lung-substance enough is left for good respiration,\r\neven although the structurally changed portions of pulmonary tissue do\r\nnot undergo entire repair.\r\n\r\nTubercular meningitis is a nearly always incurable affection. Yet a\r\nfew instances of lasting recovery have been reported where the\r\ndiagnosis was as certain as it can be in that disease in the absence\r\nof post-mortem examination. A child attended by myself, in whom the\r\nsymptoms had been of the most unfavorable kind, became apparently\r\nquite well, and continued so for a month. Then it was attacked\r\nsuddenly with convulsions, which were almost unremitting until it died\r\nwithin a day or two.\r\n\r\nGangrene of the lung is very seldom recovered from, but, unless the\r\ndiagnosis from examination of putrescent sputa has been at fault,\r\nthere have been cases in which, with the limited destruction of the\r\naffected lung, it was not fatal.\r\n\r\nPseudo-membranous croup destroys life in the majority, but not in\r\nnearly all the cases of its occurrence. It is most likely to end in\r\ndeath when distinctly a part of an attack of epidemic or endemic\r\ndiphtheria.\r\n\r\n{168} Valvular heart lesions were formerly regarded as incurable, in\r\nthe sense of restoration of the normal condition and action of the\r\nvalves impaired, yet not incompatible with years of life. This\r\nrestoration certainly very seldom takes place. But the experience of\r\nmany close observers leads to caution in anticipation of necessary and\r\npermanent disability of the heart because of murmurs, or even\r\nfunctional disturbances, seeming to prove either aortic or mitral\r\ninsufficiency or stenosis.\r\n\r\nAneurism of the aorta is very seldom recovered from, but, besides a\r\nvariable duration, whose period can almost never be anticipated with\r\nexactness, there appear to have been some cases of disappearance, or\r\nat least prolonged quiescence, of the tumor and of its morbid effects.\r\n\r\nYellow atrophy of the liver is one of the disorders most rarely ending\r\notherwise than in death.\r\n\r\nWith a course altogether indefinite in time, there appears to be a\r\ntendency to exhaust vital energy, without self-limitation, in the\r\ndifferent forms of organic degeneration, such as fatty heart,\r\nAddison's disease, chronic Bright's disease, diabetes mellitus,\r\ncirrhosis, and amyloid degeneration of the liver, etc. The same may be\r\nsaid also of the different forms of cerebral and spinal sclerosis, of\r\npernicious anæmia, and of myxoedema.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is an exception to a very general rule of fatality when a\r\ncase of trichinosis, with well-marked abdominal, muscular, and general\r\nsymptoms, ends otherwise than in death within a few weeks.\r\n\r\nSelf-limitation is familiar in the natural history of typhus and\r\ntyphoid fever, relapsing fever, yellow fever, cholera, diphtheria,\r\nwhooping cough, mumps, small-pox, varicella, scarlet fever, and\r\nmeasles. In the sense of a definite duration of each paroxysm\r\nintermittent and remittent fevers are self-limited. Are they so also\r\nin tending toward recovery, without curative treatment within a\r\ncertain time? This has been asserted, and in the case of remittent\r\nthere is evidence that spontaneous cures do sometimes happen. Some\r\nobservers aver that ague tends toward cessation of the chills after\r\nsix, eight, or ten weeks. The obstinacy of the attacks in many\r\ninstances under anti-periodic medication seems to make it probable\r\nthat spontaneous recovery from intermittent hardly belongs to the\r\ntypical natural history of the disease.\r\n\r\nWhether the term self-limited can or cannot with propriety be applied\r\nto pneumonia and other acute inflammations, as pericarditis, etc., has\r\nbeen a mooted question. If it be so, it appears to the writer to be\r\ntrue in a different meaning of the word self-limitation from that in\r\nwhich it is applied to variola or typhoid fever. Yet some nosologists\r\ndeny this distinction, and regard pneumonia as strictly a lung fever.\r\nSome of the facts supporting this view belong to the history of\r\npneumonia as complicating malarial fever; _e.g._ in the winter fever\r\nof some parts of our Southern States. It must be admitted, however,\r\nthat the inflammatory process, though morbid, is generally eliminative\r\nor corrective of a disturbing cause which produced it, and, unless\r\nthat cause is continued or repeated in action, a limitation belongs to\r\nthe succession of stages, ending either in resolution or in adhesions,\r\nserous accumulation, suppuration, or gangrene.\r\n\r\n2. It is not necessary to dwell here upon the significance in\r\nprognosis of the patient's original constitution and hereditary or\r\nacquired {169} predispositions, or on that of results left by previous\r\nattacks of illness. These are all obviously of importance. In a member\r\nof a family predisposed to consumption a bronchial attack following\r\nexposure may be much more dangerous than in others. So also a cause of\r\nmental agitation may produce insanity in a person who inherits a\r\ntendency thereto or who has before had an attack of mental\r\nderangement, while it would be innocuous to another who has no such\r\nproclivity. A second or third attack of delirium tremens is much more\r\ndangerous to life than a first attack. On the other hand, if yellow\r\nfever occurs at all in a patient who has before had it, the course of\r\nthe disease is apt to be milder than usual. The most striking example\r\nof the influence of previous disease is seen in the comparative\r\nmildness of varioloid--_i.e._ small-pox modified by the system having\r\nbeen placed under the action of the vaccine virus.\r\n\r\n3. Most important of all data in prognosis are, in most cases, the\r\nindications of the present state of the patient's system as to the\r\nperformance of the organic functions, his sum of energy, and vital\r\nresistance and persistence. Especially must these indications be\r\nregarded comparatively; that is, ascertaining whether, in a period of\r\nweeks, days, or, sometimes hours (in malignant cholera even of\r\nminutes), the patient's general condition has been and is gaining or\r\nlosing in the evidences of strength and healthy function of the great\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nEvery student of clinical medicine must become acquainted, as soon as\r\npossible, at the bedside, with these tokens and evidences, which make\r\nalmost the alphabet of practice: What is a good, a doubtful, and a bad\r\npulse? How does a patient breathe when moribund from simple\r\nexhaustion, and how does such respiration differ from the toil and\r\nstruggle of asthma or the stertor of narcotism? Why does a glance\r\nsuffice to make known to a surgeon the state of collapse after a\r\nrailroad accident, or to a physician that of cholera or pernicious\r\nintermittent? What is the impression given to the finger upon the skin\r\nby intense fever, and what by the relaxation which precedes death?\r\nThese and many other such questions are to be answered fully to each\r\nstudent only by the use of his own senses, with such interpretation as\r\nis to be obtained by the careful comparison of cases, with the aid of\r\nbooks and didactic instruction.\r\n\r\nTo a well-trained eye and hand a look and a touch will often suffice\r\nto make known the commencement of convalescence or of the precipitous\r\ndecline toward death. Yet a wise physician will be very cautious in\r\nacting upon even seemingly obvious prognostications. Changes may be\r\ngoing on in important organs whose effects have hardly yet begun to\r\nshow themselves, and which may after a while materially alter the\r\naspect of the case. Particularly near the beginning of an attack of\r\nenthetic disease, such as scarlet fever, small-pox, typhus or typhoid\r\nfever, the physician should beware of too confidently forecasting the\r\nprogress of the case for better or for worse. In nothing, probably, is\r\nthe prudence of a practitioner more often or more severely tested than\r\nin his answers to inquiries made concerning prognosis.\r\n\r\n4. Anticipation of the modifying action of remedies is undoubtedly a\r\nproper factor in our estimate of the probable result of any case of\r\nillness. Few diseases, however, are as yet so subject to control by\r\nspecific medication as to allow certainty in such expectations. In a\r\nfirst attack of ague we may look with much confidence toward the\r\nspeedy cure of our {170} patient under quinia. In one who has had\r\nchills all winter even this confidence may need qualification. A\r\nsufferer with syphilitic rheumatism may generally be promised relief\r\nunder the use of iodide of potassium, or one afflicted with scabies\r\nunder the application of sulphur ointment. We seldom have misgivings\r\nabout our ability to give relief in colic, constipation, or diarrhoea.\r\nYet the first two of these may prove to be symptoms of intestinal\r\nobstruction resisting treatment, and the last may depend upon chronic\r\nulceration of the bowel, giving it unexpected continuance. In all such\r\ninstances careful and (when practicable) accurate diagnosis must\r\nprecede prognosis; our estimate of the action of remedies becomes then\r\na secondary, although often a valuable, part of the calculation of the\r\nprobabilities of the case.\r\n\r\nPrognosis in particular diseases involves the consideration not only\r\nof those signs of the general vital condition to which we have just\r\nbeen giving attention, but also of such as are more or less peculiar\r\nto each disorder. To a certain extent these signs may be grouped. We\r\nmay refer to good and bad signs in pulmonary, cardiac, intestinal,\r\nrenal, cerebral, and febrile affections respectively. Still, there\r\nwill be for each malady, if it really has a distinctive character,\r\nsome tokens which experience shows to be specially indicative of\r\nfavorable or unfavorable progress and results.\r\n\r\nLet us notice some of these as examples.\r\n\r\nIn pneumonia the best signs are the lowering of a high temperature,\r\nreduction of the number of respirations to 20 or 25 in the minute,\r\nexpectoration of sputa less and less tinged with red or brown, and\r\ngradual reduction of the region of dulness on percussion. Worst, in\r\nthe same disease, are an axillary temperature over 106°, respirations\r\n40 or more per minute, with delirium, and expectoration becoming more\r\nabundant, grayish, and purulent; also with continued dulness on\r\npercussion and abundant mucous râles on auscultation.\r\n\r\nIn croup the best sign is, after a hoarse, dry, barking cough and\r\ndyspnoea, a soft, liquid râle, heard in the larynx and trachea during\r\nrespiration or coughing. Worst, in croup, is a steadily or\r\nparoxysmally increasing difficulty of breathing, with a dry hissing or\r\nwhistling sound of respiration and cough succeeding the barking sounds\r\nof the earlier stage.\r\n\r\nIn phthisis pulmonalis among the best signs are the patient's\r\nincreasing in weight, coughing and expectorating less, ceasing to have\r\nhectic and night sweats. These may give renewed hope, even before much\r\nchange is discernible in the physical signs. Of bad omen are intense\r\nhectic fever, incessant cough with abundant nummular sputa, copious\r\nperspirations, diarrhoea, breathing growing shorter and shorter, and\r\nextreme emaciation and debility.\r\n\r\nIn all organic affections of the heart an extremely rapid and\r\nirregular pulse, with orthopnoea and increasing anasarca, and\r\nespecially the Cheyne-Stokes respiration (described under DIAGNOSIS),\r\nmust cause unfavorable expectations.\r\n\r\nIn obstruction of the bowels the best of all symptoms is, usually, of\r\ncourse, a copious fecal evacuation. Yet a few cases have occurred in\r\nwhich a very large evacuation, delayed by obstruction for a week or\r\ntwo, has been almost immediately followed by collapse and death. The\r\nworst signs in cases of obstruction are (besides long-unyielding\r\nconstipation) {171} stercoraceous vomiting, a small, rapid pulse, and\r\nincreasing coldness and clamminess of the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nIn cholera infantum the best signs are cessation of vomiting and\r\npurging, the discharges growing more nearly natural, the face becoming\r\nless shrunken in aspect, sleep taking the place of coma vigil or\r\nwaking apathy, and water or milk, when taken, remaining on the\r\nstomach. Worst, in the same disease, are incessant rejection of\r\neverything swallowed, watery passages from the bowels every half hour\r\nor hour, shrinking of the face and body to skin and bone, with an\r\napathetic expression of the open or half-open eyes, the latter rolling\r\noften from side to side.\r\n\r\nIn epidemic cholera good signs are the arrest of vomiting and of\r\nrice-water discharges from the bowels, rapid movement of the blood in\r\nthe veins after removal of momentary pressure, return of natural color\r\nand warmth to the skin, with filling up of the pulse at the wrist. Bad\r\nsigns in cholera are shrinking of the cheeks and of the flesh upon the\r\nhands, deepening ashiness or blueness of the skin, coldness and\r\nclamminess to the touch, dyspnoea, loss of pulse, incessant vomiting\r\nand purging of rice-water stools, constant cramps of the limbs, and\r\nsuppression of urine.\r\n\r\nIn acute cerebral meningitis good signs are lessened temperature of\r\nthe head, quiet sleep without stertor, disappearance of delirium, more\r\nnatural pulse, and attention to surrounding objects, without\r\ndisquietude. Bad signs in the same disease are deep stupor,\r\nstrabismus, convulsions, paralysis, involuntary defecation and\r\nurination.\r\n\r\nIn typhus fever good signs are the pulse becoming slower and fuller,\r\nthe skin less hot, more soft and moist, the tongue moist and clean,\r\nthe face losing its dusky flush, and consciousness returning instead\r\nof muttering delirium.[40] Bad, in the same fever, are deepening of\r\nthe flush of the countenance, profound stupor, rapid and feeble pulse,\r\nlying on the back and sinking down toward the foot of the bed, with\r\nsuppression of urine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the return of the\r\npulse to its normal rate is often considerably delayed in\r\nconvalescence from typhus and typhoid fevers and other protracted\r\ndiseases. If, then, the temperature is not above 99° F., and is stable\r\nfrom morning to night, the tongue is clean and moist, and appetite\r\nbegins to appear, we need not be alarmed, although the pulse continues\r\nas high as 90 or 100 per minute, in a case attended by positive\r\ndebility.]\r\n\r\nIn typhoid fever many of the good and bad signs are the same as in\r\ntyphus, belonging to closely similar general conditions. But in\r\ntyphoid fever we observe also as favorable signs the lessening of\r\ntympanites, more nearly natural fecal stools, and the absence of\r\ntenderness in any part of the abdomen. As unfavorable, increase of\r\ntympanites and diarrhoea, sometimes large hemorrhages from the bowels;\r\nworst of all, at a late stage, sudden increase of abdominal\r\ndistension, with dulness on percussion, coldness of the skin, great\r\nrapidity and feebleness of the pulse following perforation of the\r\nbowel, resulting usually in fatal peritonitis.\r\n\r\nIn scarlet fever, measles, and small-pox it is a favorable sign for\r\nthe eruption to come out well at the usual time; its sudden recession\r\nthreatens malignancy. In small-pox a confluent eruption marks a\r\ndangerous case, and so does the occurrence of distinct pustules in the\r\nthroat. Early in scarlet fever stupor is very threatening, though not\r\nnecessarily mortal. Late in the same disease bloody urine, or, worse\r\nyet, suppression of urine, may well cause alarm.\r\n\r\nIn all children's diseases the early occurrence of convulsions shows a\r\n{172} severe but not always a dangerous attack. The late occurrence of\r\nconvulsions is commonly much more serious in its significance.[41]\r\nConvulsions are always of vastly less importance, prognostically, in\r\nchildren than in adolescents or adults. Yet they are always serious\r\nsigns. While recovered from in the large majority of cases, they may\r\nat any time be fatal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Yet I saw a case of acute cerebro-meningitis, in a girl\r\nten years of age, in which a violent convulsion occurred on about the\r\nsixth day of the disease, and was followed by convalescence.]\r\n\r\nThese enumerations, selected as examples merely, might be much farther\r\nextended but that the special prognosis of each disease will be fully\r\nset forth in the several articles upon them in the body of this work.\r\nThose now given may suffice for the illustration of the method and\r\ngeneral principles by which the physician must be guided in his\r\nanticipation of the progress and result of cases of disease. The\r\ncaution may be repeated, to observe great care in forming a conclusion\r\nin regard to prognosis in every instance, and still more in expressing\r\nit, unless in the presence of very clear and positive evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{173}\r\n\r\nHYGIENE.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN S. BILLINGS, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this paper is to indicate some of the ways in which\r\nhygiene, both private and public, is connected with the duties of the\r\ngeneral practitioner, and to give some information as to modern\r\nmethods of investigation and work in preventive medicine.\r\n\r\nWhile the business of the physician is more especially the care of the\r\nsick with reference to the cure of disease, or, where that is beyond\r\nhis power, as is too frequently the case, to relieve suffering and\r\nsecure temporary ease for his patient, he is nevertheless often called\r\nupon to answer questions as to the causes of disease, and the best\r\nmeans of avoiding or destroying these causes. Not only does diagnosis\r\noften turn upon considerations of etiology, but a very considerable\r\npart of the treatment of actual disease must be hygienic in the\r\nbroader sense of the word. The prescription or the surgical operation\r\nmust not only be supplemented by advice as to residence, clothing,\r\nfood, exercise, etc., but must, in many cases, be merely supplementary\r\nto such advice, which indicates the really essential method of\r\ntreatment; and the giving this advice then becomes the most important\r\npart of the physician's work, although not usually recognized as such\r\nby his patients. The chief value of the prescription is, in fact,\r\noften to methodize the mode of life of the patient and to remind him\r\nat frequently recurring intervals of the regimen which has been\r\nordered with it.\r\n\r\nThe physician has also certain duties in relation to the public at\r\nlarge, as well as to his individual patients, and these duties become\r\nmore numerous and important as the density of population increases, so\r\nthat in the large cities of most civilized countries he finds himself,\r\nnolens volens, in almost daily contact with legally constituted\r\nauthorities in the shape of registrars, health officers, coroners,\r\netc., and is not infrequently summoned before the courts as a supposed\r\nexpert in matters connected with the public health.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the physician who has become eminent in his profession is,\r\nin many cases the adviser, and, so far as professional subjects are\r\nconcerned, to a great extent the guide, of those who legislate for, or\r\nexecute the laws of, not only his own city or county, but his state\r\nand the nation; and he must to a corresponding degree be held\r\nresponsible for the position which he takes and the advice which he\r\ngives in regard to public health matters. This is true whether his\r\nattitude on these subjects {174} be active or passive, for his silence\r\nwill be taken to mean that there is no necessity for action or change.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this paper do not permit the presentation of proofs and\r\nillustrations of these somewhat dogmatic assertions, but it is\r\nbelieved that they will meet with general assent from medical men\r\nwithout formal and detailed argument, and that it is unnecessary here\r\nto urge the interest or importance of practical hygiene upon the\r\nmedical profession, or to enlarge upon the desirability that the\r\npractitioner, as well as the professional sanitarian, should be\r\nfamiliar with the conclusions of modern science and technology with\r\nregard to it.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of many intelligent and thoughtful physicians there is,\r\nno doubt, a feeling of unformulated distrust as to the real\r\npossibilities or probabilities of improving the health and diminishing\r\nthe mortality of the community at large; and this feeling is in part\r\ndue to the exaggerated claims and emotional exhortations of some\r\nadvocates of hygiene. A careful and unprejudiced survey of what has\r\nbeen accomplished by sanitary measures will, however, largely\r\ndissipate this distrust.\r\n\r\nThe natural term of the life of man is fixed by the physiologist at\r\nabout one hundred years, which is nearly in accordance with the law\r\nindicated by Flourens, that the period of life of an animal is about\r\nfive times that required to perfect the development of its skeleton\r\nand unite the epiphyses with the shafts of the long bones. The actual\r\naverage duration of human life is less than half this, but there is\r\nsatisfactory evidence that it has increased in civilized countries.\r\nThe ancient estimate is expressed in David's declaration, that \"the\r\ndays of a man are threescore years and ten, and if by reason of\r\nstrength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and\r\nsorrow.\" Kolb, a cautious and learned statistician, concluded, from\r\nhis studies, that while the maximum age reached by man has not\r\nmaterially changed for many centuries, the number of persons who now\r\nsurvive infancy and of those who reach a ripe old age has decidedly\r\nincreased; and this opinion is sustained by Mr. Lewis, the secretary\r\nof the Chamber of Life Insurance of New York, who points out that\r\nwhile civilization largely interferes with the laws of evolution by\r\nsurvivorship, it aids by economizing the waste which occurs in its\r\nabsence. \"Under natural selection, when variations in capacity arise,\r\nthousands of them are wasted where one is secured, fixed, and\r\ntransmitted. But human society economizes much of this waste, fastens\r\nupon and improves an immensely larger proportion of the capacities\r\nlavishly produced by Nature, and thus concentrates forces which would\r\notherwise spread their operation over countless ages.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Influence of Civilization on the Duration of Life,\"\r\n_Reports Am. Pub. Health Ass'n_, N.Y., 1877, vol. iii. p. 173.]\r\n\r\nWe have, however, no record of the duration of life in ancient Greece\r\nand Rome, and it is quite possible that it was greater than in Western\r\nEurope during the Middle Ages, which formed a period of retrogression\r\nin a sanitary point of view. The Jew, the Greek, and the Roman, prior\r\nto the Christian era, were probably cleaner in person and in dwellings\r\nthan the people of the time when dirt became the odor of sanctity.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of reliable data for this country, it is impossible to\r\nspeak with certainty of the results of attempts made here to prevent\r\ndisease and death. Each sex, race, and age has its own rate of\r\nmortality, {175} and until this rate is determined we can only guess\r\nas to whether good work is being done or not.\r\n\r\nWe can never hope to diminish the total number of deaths which will\r\noccur in long periods, say two hundred years, but we may rationally\r\ntry to prolong the average duration of life, to diminish infant\r\nmortality, and to secure greater comfort and better health for\r\nindividuals and for the community at large.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember that only a mere outline of the subject can\r\nbe presented here; the details would require several volumes, and the\r\ntendency to specialization in this, as in other branches, is so great\r\nthat it is hardly to be expected that any one man shall have either\r\nthe theoretical or the practical knowledge necessary for covering the\r\nentire field. There are certain things in relation to hygiene which\r\nevery physician should know; there are many other things with regard\r\nto which it is sufficient if he knows where to find full and reliable\r\ninformation when he needs it. With this preface we will pass at once\r\nto our subject, which may be conveniently divided as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. Causes of disease, means of discovery, and prevention.\r\n   II. Personal hygiene in its relations to the practice of medicine.\r\n  III. Public hygiene in its relations to physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Causes of Disease, Means of Discovery, and Prevention.\r\n\r\nAlthough the origin of disease has from the earliest times been the\r\nsubject of study by medical men, the physician has not heretofore,\r\nusually, been called upon to investigate the causes of disease in\r\nparticular localities, until the occurrence of sickness in that\r\nlocality has called attention to the matter. The education of the\r\npublic as to the importance of sanitary work has, however, recently\r\nmade great progress, and it is now not unusual to ask the opinion of\r\nthe family physician as to the healthfulness of a given locality or\r\nhouse. The question may be presented in three different ways: First.\r\nIn a given case of disease, what is the probable cause? Second. Given\r\nthe presence of a known or suspected cause of disease, what are the\r\nbest means of avoiding or destroying it? Third. In the absence of\r\ncases of disease, to determine whether causes of disease are probably\r\npresent, and if so, what causes.\r\n\r\nThe word \"cause\" is here used in its widest sense, including not only\r\nwhat are commonly called predisposing and exciting causes, but also\r\nthose conditions which aggravate or continue the disease. These causes\r\nmay be roughly classed as follows: Heredity; impure air; impure water;\r\nclimate; habitations; occupation; food; intemperance of various kinds;\r\nclothing; errors in exercise; sexual errors; parasites; contagia;\r\nexpectant attention and other mental causes, including worry, etc. In\r\nmost cases two or more of these classes of causes are combined in\r\naction for the production of a given case or outbreak of disease, and\r\nwhen we refer any disease to a single factor, what is meant usually\r\nis, not that this is the sole and exclusive cause, but that it is the\r\nmost prominent one.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, let us consider briefly some of the causes above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nI. HEREDITY.--That the child inherits from its parents its physical\r\n{176} type, including color, stature, physiognomy, temperament, and\r\ncertain peculiarities of structure or arrangement of internal organs,\r\nis well known. This hereditary influence is stronger from the\r\nimmediate than from the remote ancestry, although the curious\r\nphenomena of atavism sometimes form exceptions to this rule. The\r\nhereditary causes of disease can be guarded against when known.\r\nTheoretically, by preventing generation on the part of persons who are\r\nunfit to produce offspring; practically, to a certain extent, by\r\ntaking special precautions against these causes and their effects in\r\nthe individual, particularly at those ages in which these influences\r\nseem to have their greatest force. The most important of these\r\nhereditary diseases are syphilis, consumption, scrofula, cancer, gout,\r\ncertain skin diseases, insanity, and criminal tendencies of various\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nThe physician's advice is rarely asked with regard to the propriety,\r\nfrom a sanitary point of view, of a proposed marriage, nor is it often\r\ntaken when given, unless, indeed, it happens to correspond with the\r\nwishes of the recipient; nevertheless, he is occasionally in a\r\nposition to exert influence in such a matter, and when this is the\r\ncase the following general rules may be borne in mind: 1. No marriage\r\nshould occur between persons having the same hereditary tendency to\r\ndisease; and this is especially important in marriages between\r\nrelatives. 2. A girl should not marry under the age of twenty. 3. A\r\nperson affected with hereditary or well-marked constitutional\r\nsyphilis, or having a strong consumptive taint, or tendency to mental\r\nunsoundness, should not marry at all.\r\n\r\nThe precautions to be taken in individual cases in which there is a\r\nknown hereditary predisposition to certain diseases will probably be\r\nindicated in the articles upon those special diseases. The most\r\nimportant of these, from the sanitary point of view, are consumption\r\nand gout, partly because of their frequency, partly because of the\r\nundoubted power which a proper regimen, applied in time, has in\r\ncontrolling them. The pain in gout has often an excellent sanitary\r\neffect; it is an inducement to temperance much stronger than any\r\namount of good advice.\r\n\r\nThe influence of heredity in producing abnormities of refraction and\r\naccommodation of the eye, and the importance of detecting these early\r\nand giving them proper treatment, have not hitherto received, from the\r\ngeneral practitioner, the attention which they deserve. Children of\r\nparents affected with astigmatism, ametropia, etc. should be carefully\r\nexamined before being placed at school, and if necessary fitted with\r\nproper glasses.\r\n\r\nThe heredity of idiosyncrasies as to certain articles of food or\r\ncertain drugs must also be borne in mind by the physician, for,\r\nalthough implicit confidence is not always to be placed in the\r\nstatement of a patient that he cannot take a certain medicine, yet a\r\nknowledge of the facts will occasionally save the prescriber from some\r\nawkward mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of bearing in mind the family peculiarities is best\r\nappreciated by the old family doctor who has had two or three\r\ngenerations pass under his hands: he knows, for example, that in one\r\nfamily he may expect brain complications, in another lung troubles,\r\nand that what would be grave symptoms in one house are of\r\ncomparatively small import in another. Unfortunately, the greater part\r\nof this kind of knowledge has not yet been formulated, and each\r\nphysician has to acquire it for himself; but he will find the process\r\nof acquisition greatly facilitated if in all cases in a new family he\r\nmakes it a rule to learn something of the medical {177} history of the\r\nparents, and he will find intelligent laymen quick to appreciate his\r\ninquiries in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe importance of taking into account hereditary influences is well\r\nillustrated by the care which is taken to obtain information with\r\nregard to them in well-conducted life insurance companies. The medical\r\nexaminers of such companies have their attention specially called to\r\nthis matter, and the following extract from a manual of instructions\r\nshows how it is regarded from a business point of view: \"If\r\nconsumption is found to have occurred in the family of the applicant,\r\nhe is to be regarded not insurable under the following circumstances,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n                                                       YEARS OF AGE.\r\n  If in both parents, not insurable until . . . . . . . . .  40\r\n  If in one parent, not insurable until . . . . . . . . . .  30\r\n    (Except for ten-year endowments, then 20 years.)\r\n  If in two members (not parents) . . . . . . . . . . . . .  35\r\n  If in one member (brother or sister)  . . . . . . . . . .  20\r\n    (Except for ten-year endowments, when peculiarly favorable.)\"\r\n\r\nIf apoplexy, paralysis, or heart disease is found to have occurred in\r\nany two members of the applicant's family, he is to be regarded as\r\ninsurable only upon the endowment plan, the term of insurance to\r\nexpire prior to his reaching the age of fifty years. If insanity shall\r\nhave so occurred (in two members), a provisionary clause is essential,\r\nand is attached to the policy by the company.\r\n\r\nII. IMPURE AIR.--The dangers of impure air, water, and food depend\r\nlargely upon the fact that through these media may be introduced into\r\nthe body particles of organic matter, living or dead, which tend to\r\nproduce disease in the recipient. The parasites are types of this mode\r\nof disease-production, and these blend with the contagia of the\r\nspecific diseases in such a way that it is not easy to draw the\r\ndistinction in all cases. There are also certain poisonous gases and\r\ninorganic compounds which may occasionally be present in air or water\r\nto such an extent as to produce disease; but as a rule the gaseous\r\nimpurities of the air are offensive to the smell rather than\r\ndangerous, as will be seen when we come to consider the effluvium\r\nnuisances.\r\n\r\nThe subject of ventilation, for the purpose of procuring an adequate\r\nsupply of pure air, is one of so much importance, and one upon which\r\nthe physician is so liable to be called for practical advice, that it\r\nseems proper to state briefly the general principles which should\r\ngovern investigations into, or recommendations upon, this subject.\r\n\r\nThe impurities of air which are to be disposed of by ventilation are\r\nfor the most part derived from the human body, chiefly from\r\nrespiration, and these only will be considered here. In some cases it\r\nis necessary to make special provision for the products of combustion\r\nfrom gas, etc., but as a rule this is rather for the purpose of\r\nregulation of temperature than anything else. The impurities of air\r\ndue to the presence of human beings consist mainly of carbonic acid,\r\nammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen, and sulphide of ammonium, and of\r\nvarious organic compounds, mostly in the form of minute particles of\r\norganic matter of uncertain structure, but extremely prone to\r\ndecomposition. It is usual to estimate the degree of impurity by the\r\namount of carbonic acid present, and this leads many persons to\r\nsuppose that the carbonic acid is in itself the chief and most\r\ndangerous impurity. This gas is, however, not perceptible to the\r\nsenses, {178} nor is it injurious to health, unless present in much\r\ngreater proportion than that in which it will be found in the most\r\ncrowded habitations or assembly-rooms. Its importance in questions of\r\nventilation depends upon the fact that its increase in a room beyond\r\nthe amount present in the outer air may usually be taken to be in\r\ndirect proportion to the amount of the really dangerous and offensive\r\nimpurities present, and that the amount of carbonic acid can be\r\nascertained by chemical tests with comparative ease and rapidity;\r\nwhich is not the case with regard to the organic matter. The carbonic\r\nacid is therefore taken as the measure of the impurity, although it is\r\nnot itself the impurity of which we are most anxious to be free.\r\n\r\nTo decide as to whether a room is well ventilated or not, some\r\nstandard of permissible impurity must be fixed, and this standard is\r\nnow usually taken to be, in a room occupied by human beings, that\r\ncondition of air which produces in a person having a normal sense of\r\nsmell, and who enters from the fresh air, a faint sensation of an odor\r\nvery slightly musty and unpleasant. Upon testing the air of such a\r\nroom, it will be found that the amount of carbonic acid impurity\r\npresent--that is, the excess of this acid over the amount in the\r\nexternal air--will be between 2 and 3 parts in 10,000.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of carbonic acid in normal air varies from 2 to 5 parts\r\nin 10,000 in different places, and in the same place at different\r\ntimes, it is better to look to the carbonic acid impurity as above\r\ndefined rather than to the total amount of the acid found present, if\r\nstrict accuracy is desired; but usually the statement of Dr. Parkes is\r\ncorrect, that the organic impurity of the air is not perceptible to\r\nthe senses until the total carbonic acid rises to the proportion of 6\r\nparts in 10,000 volumes. When the carbonic acid reaches 9 parts in\r\n10,000 the air is close, and when it exceeds 1 part in 1000 the air is\r\nusually decidedly unpleasant. If we take 2 parts in 10,000 as the\r\npermissible maximum of carbonic acid impurity, it follows that the\r\namount of fresh air which must be supplied and thoroughly distributed\r\nfor each person per hour is 3000 cubic feet. If 3 parts per 10,000 be\r\ntaken as the permissible maximum (which is the standard of\r\nPettenkofer), the amount of air per head per hour must be 2000 cubic\r\nfeet. While it is impossible, as Dr. Parkes remarks, to show by direct\r\nevidence that the impurity indicated by 7, 8, or even 10, parts of\r\ncarbonic acid per 10,000 is injurious to health, it is advisable to\r\naccept his standard, because it is a simple one, and can be\r\npractically applied without special apparatus or technical skill, and\r\nbecause there is evidence of the injury to health which continued\r\nexposure to air impure, by this standard, ultimately produces.\r\n\r\nKeeping this standard in view, the physician may be called on for an\r\nopinion as to whether the ventilation of a given building is\r\nsatisfactory or as to the merits of a proposed plan for ventilation.\r\nThe first is a question of fact: What are the effects produced upon\r\nthe inmates? Are there unpleasant odors in the building or not? What\r\npercentage of carbonic impurity is present? What is the number of\r\ncubic feet of air per head that is introduced and removed per hour?\r\nAnd what is the character of the fresh-air supply as to purity? Does\r\nit come from the cellar, or from other rooms, or from a foul area?\r\nAir-currents can usually be best investigated by the fumes of nascent\r\nmuriate of ammonia produced by {179} exposing a cylinder of common\r\nblotting-paper, moistened with dilute hydrochloric acid, to the vapors\r\ncoming from a crumpled fragment of the same paper moistened with\r\ncommon aqua ammonia and placed within the cylinder. The process for\r\ncarbonic acid determination is simple, and can be learned in three\r\nhours in a laboratory under a skilful teacher. It does not seem worth\r\nwhile to describe it here. The determination of the amount of air\r\npassing through a given register, flue, or chimney in a given time is\r\nto be made by the use of an anemometer, an instrument which registers\r\nthe velocity of the current of air passing through it.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the merits of a plan of ventilation the following points\r\nshould be remembered: The defect in most plans for ventilation is in\r\nthe air-supply. Many people suppose that they have made all necessary\r\nprovision for ventilation if they have put in tubes or openings for\r\nthe escape of foul air, forgetting that these outlets will have no\r\neffect if corresponding inlets are not provided. Examine, first of\r\nall, therefore, the ducts, flues, and openings proposed for the\r\nfresh-air supply, with reference to their size and position and the\r\namount of air to be furnished by them. These will almost invariably be\r\nfound to be too small. The proper size of flues and registers for a\r\ngiven room is ascertained by dividing the number of cubic feet of air\r\nto be supplied per second by the velocity in feet per second which the\r\nair is to have in the flue or opening, bearing in mind that it is much\r\nbetter that these flues and registers shall be too large than too\r\nsmall, since it is easy to reduce their capacity, but, in most cases,\r\nimpossible to increase it. When the fresh-air register is so situated\r\nthat the current of air from it is liable to strike upon the person of\r\nan occupant of the room, the velocity of this current should not\r\nexceed 1-1/2 feet per second if unpleasant draughts are to be avoided;\r\nand it will usually be found best that the velocity of the air in the\r\nflue shall not exceed 6 feet per second, except in the case of very\r\nlarge flues, where the element of friction becomes of comparatively\r\nsmall importance. In the great majority of cases the amount of air to\r\nbe supplied depends upon the number of persons, and not on the cubic\r\nspace; but in exceptional instances, where the amount of cubic space\r\nis very large in proportion to the number of persons, and the heating\r\nis effected by warm air, it may require more air to keep the room at a\r\ncomfortable temperature than is necessary for the supply of the\r\noccupants. The cubic space is also relatively much more important in\r\nrooms which are to be occupied but a short time continuously, and can\r\nthen be thoroughly aired, than it is in rooms constantly occupied.\r\n\r\nThe methods of calculation can be best illustrated by one or two\r\nexamples. What should be the number and size of flues and registers\r\nfor fresh-air supply for a hospital ward to contain 24 beds, the ward\r\nbeing a rectangular pavilion with windows on opposite sides? In this\r\ncase the room is constantly occupied, and the supply of air should be\r\n1 cubic foot per head per second, or, in all, 24 cubic feet per\r\nsecond. The velocity of current at the registers should not exceed 3\r\nfeet per second--better only 2. This will require from 8 to 12 square\r\nfeet of clear opening in the registers. If we allow four on each side\r\nof the room, each register must have at least 1 square foot of clear\r\nopening. The velocity of the air in the flues supplying these\r\nregisters should not exceed 4 feet per second, and therefore the area\r\nof each flue should be about 9 by 12 {180} inches. Suppose the same\r\nquestion be asked with regard to a school-room to contain 48 pupils.\r\nIn this case the room will not be occupied more than two hours at a\r\ntime. The air-supply desirable may be put down at 35 cubic feet per\r\nhead per minute, or 28 cubic feet per second for the whole. The\r\nvelocity in the flues may be put, as before, at 4 feet per second;\r\nhence we need 7 square feet area of flue, or seven flues, each having\r\n1 square foot of area. It is safe to say that there are not twenty\r\nschool-houses in the United States which have fresh-air flues of\r\nsufficient area; the deficiency is made up, for the most part, by\r\nleakage of the outer air through cracks around windows and directly\r\nthrough the wall, and also by the passage of air from the central hall\r\ninto the room, this last air coming from the cellar or basement.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the air at the foul-air registers and in the foul-air\r\nducts may be greater than in the fresh-air flues, since there is no\r\ndanger of its causing draughts, and hence there is no truth in the\r\ncommon notion that the outlets should be larger than the inlets to\r\nallow for the expansion of heated air. It is important that the\r\nvelocity of the current in the outlet shaft or chimney should be at\r\nleast 8 feet per second at the point where it escapes into the outer\r\nair; and if the outlets be too large for the inlets, the result may be\r\nthat some of the foul-air flues will work backward and become inlets.\r\nThe plan of making everything a little larger than is necessary is not\r\na safe one as regards chimney-flues and outlet shafts.\r\n\r\nThe merits of a plan of ventilation depend not only on the amount of\r\nair introduced, but on its distribution. The test for distribution is\r\nchemical analysis of samples taken in different parts of the room and\r\nat different levels. A very good idea of the direction taken by the\r\nincoming air can also be obtained by the use of fumes of nascent\r\nmuriate of ammonia, as above described. In considering the\r\ndistribution which will probably take place in a given plan, care\r\nshould be taken not to fall into the common error of supposing that\r\nbecause pure carbonic acid gas is heavier than air, therefore the\r\ncarbonic acid derived from respiration sinks to the floor, and that\r\nspecial provision should be made to remove it at that point. The law\r\nof the diffusion of gases effectually prevents this separation and\r\nsinking of the carbonic acid from the mixture of gases expired, and it\r\nwill be found to be present in about equal proportions in all parts of\r\nan inhabited room.\r\n\r\nThe methods of introducing and distributing fresh air depend to a\r\ngreat extent upon the methods of heating employed; and it is necessary\r\nto remember that while good ventilation is a very desirable thing,\r\nsatisfactory heating is, in cold weather, still more desirable, and\r\nmust be attained even if the ventilation is interfered with for that\r\npurpose. The principal difficulty in the way of securing good\r\nventilation is its cost. In a cold climate satisfactory heating, good\r\nventilation, and cheapness are not compatible; it is comparatively\r\neasy to obtain any two of them, but impossible to have the three\r\ntogether. This fact should be fully understood and realized by the\r\nphysician, for its comprehension will save much time in considering\r\nthe merits of various patent ventilators and ventilating appliances,\r\nwhich, according to their inventors, produce good ventilation at no\r\nexpense beyond that of the original cost of the apparatus; which is\r\npractically about the same as a claim to have discovered perpetual\r\nmotion. Patent ventilators are usually cowls to be placed upon the top\r\nof outlet {181} flues. I know of none which are superior to the common\r\nEmerson Ventilator, on which there is now no patent. In cold weather\r\nthe air must be warmed to secure comfort; it must be changed to secure\r\nventilation. The changing of the air carries off heat, the loss of\r\nwhich must be supplied by fuel, which fuel costs money. The greater\r\nthe ventilation, the more rapid the change and the more heat required.\r\nIt is therefore quite possible to judge somewhat of the merits of a\r\nheating and ventilating apparatus--for example, of a\r\nschool-house--from the amount of fuel consumed; but the conclusion\r\nwill be precisely the reverse of that drawn by the average trustee,\r\nsince it will be, that within certain limits the less fuel required\r\nthe less satisfactory the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe evil effects of insufficient ventilation, although very certain\r\nand very serious, are not immediate, or such as to attract attention\r\nat first, except in very aggravated cases with excessive\r\nover-crowding. The power of the organism to adjust itself to\r\nsurrounding circumstances is very great, and perhaps as great in\r\nregard to the endurance of foul air as anything else. Yet this power\r\nis greater in seeming than in reality, for at last such air produces\r\ndisease and shortens life. Its effects are manifested in diseases of\r\nthe respiratory organs, acute and chronic, and it is now generally\r\nadmitted that the undue prevalence of phthisis in troops is due to the\r\nfoul air of the barrack-rooms.\r\n\r\nSome persons are much more susceptible than others to the effects of\r\nimpure air, and will suffer from headache, languor, loss of appetite,\r\netc. where others would experience little inconvenience. Children thus\r\nsusceptible dread the school-room as ordinarily constructed and\r\nventilated, and their discomfort should be taken into account and\r\nguarded against.\r\n\r\nThus far, reference has been made only to those impurities of air due\r\nto respiration and lights; in other words, the necessary impurities\r\nfound in human habitations. The impurities due to sewer gases will be\r\nreferred to hereafter; they should be prevented absolutely, and not\r\nprovided for by ventilation. One of the most difficult problems\r\npresented to the physician is to determine whether the effluvia from a\r\ngiven locality are injurious to health, and if so, to what extent.\r\nThese effluvia may be due to certain occupations or manufactures, or\r\nthey may result from the disposal of excreta, from obstructed drainage\r\ngiving rise to swamps and the collection of decaying organic matter,\r\nand in other ways. The best definition of the term \"injurious to\r\nhealth\" in this connection is perhaps that suggested by Dr.\r\nBallard--_i.e._ that exposure to the offensive effluvia causes bodily\r\ndiscomfort or other functional disturbance, continuing or recurring as\r\nthe exposure continues or recurs, and tending by continuance or\r\nrepetition to create an appreciable impairment of general health and\r\nstrength, to render those exposed more liable than others to attacks\r\nof disease, and more apt to suffer severely when attacked, and, in the\r\nmore serious forms, to the direct production of the disease and the\r\nshortening of life.\r\n\r\nThe group of symptoms due to offensive effluvia is, as Dr. Ballard\r\nremarks, a tolerably constant one, and consists of loss of appetite,\r\nnausea, headache, giddiness, faintness, and a general sense of\r\ndepression, with, in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea. But it is\r\nusually impossible to prove by statistics that these phenomena are due\r\nto a given effluvium complained of, for those who suffer from it are\r\nusually exposed to other causes of ill-health, such as poverty,\r\novercrowding, collection of filth, etc.; and, on the {182} other hand,\r\nmany of those exposed to the effluvium seem to suffer very little, if\r\nat all, from their surroundings. And so true is this, that in the\r\ncarefully prepared report upon effluvium nuisances recently issued by\r\nDr. Ballard,[2] it will be found that as a rule no attempt is made to\r\nprove that the effluvia from any particular branch of industry are\r\ninjurious to health; the test practically applied is that they produce\r\noffensive odors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Report in respect of the Inquiry as to Effluvium\r\nNuisances arising in connection with various Manufacturing and other\r\nbranches of Industry_. By Dr. Ballard, London. Her Majesty's\r\nStationery Office, 1882, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe legal view of this subject is given in the various decisions as to\r\nwhat should be considered a nuisance, the essence of which is the use\r\nof one's own property in such a way as to inflict damage upon, and\r\ninjure the rights of, another. If a man collects on his own premises,\r\nfor his own use, any material, such as water or filth, he is bound to\r\nretain it within his own premises or to let none of it escape in such\r\na way as to damage others; and this holds good as regards gases,\r\nvapors, and odors. The decision of Mansfield, in the case of Rex _vs._\r\nWhite, is often quoted approvingly by jurists, viz.: \"It is not\r\nnecessary that the smell be unwholesome; it is enough if it renders\r\nthe enjoyment of life uncomfortable.\" But, practically, the question\r\nas to whether the discomfort produced is sufficient to produce\r\nill-health will be the one upon which the physician is called to give\r\nevidence, and the one also upon which he will find it most difficult\r\nto obtain data sufficient to enable him to form a positive opinion.\r\n\r\nIII. IMPURE WATER.--Of all the various preventable or removable causes\r\nof disease to which the attention of the physician engaged in practice\r\nin the small towns and rural districts is directed, it will usually be\r\nfound that the water-supply is the most important, because it is in\r\nthese localities that it is most liable to become contaminated in such\r\na way as to produce sickness.\r\n\r\nAll water used for drinking purposes is impure in the chemical sense,\r\nsince it contains some inorganic matters or salts, and in most cases\r\norganic matter also. It is difficult to define precisely what should\r\nbe considered an impure water in a sanitary sense, and the best we can\r\ndo is to indicate probabilities in the absence of positive evidence of\r\nthe production of disease by the suspected water. So far as inorganic\r\nimpurities are concerned, the most important, from the sanitary point\r\nof view, are the salts of lead, magnesia, and lime, but in this\r\ncountry these are so rarely the cause of disease that they hardly\r\nrequire special notice. The physician should, however, bear in mind\r\npossibilities of lead-poisoning in some obscure cases which he will\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nThe diseases due to impure water are certain specific fevers,\r\ndiarrhoeal diseases, and some affections due to parasites which find\r\nentrance to the body through this medium. The water-supply is to be\r\nsuspected in case of prevalence of diarrhoeal disease in a community,\r\nand especially if the outbreak be sudden and affect a number of\r\npersons and families. Sudden outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever, or\r\nmalarial fever, confined to a limited locality, should lead to careful\r\nexamination of the water-supply. The impurity in water which causes\r\nthese diseases is supposed to be either organic or the product of\r\norganic life, and at present the prevailing opinion is that the really\r\ndangerous impurities consist of minute living organisms or {183}\r\ngerms. It is usual to estimate the impurity of water by the amount of\r\norganic matter present, but it is evident that this alone can give no\r\npositive information, since by this standard milk and soup would be\r\nvery dangerous. Much depends upon the character of the organic matter,\r\nwhether it is derived from the animal or vegetable kingdom--whether it\r\nis in a state of fermentation or putrefaction, etc. etc.; but the\r\npresence of specific germs in it is the most important part of all,\r\nand at the same time the most difficult to ascertain. Nitrogenous\r\norganic matter in a state of decomposition is dangerous, yet it does\r\nnot always produce disease, even when ingested in comparatively large\r\nquantity, as in case of \"high\" game or tainted meat; and it is easy to\r\nfind instances where water strongly polluted with sewage has been used\r\nfor a considerable period without producing marked ill effects. It is,\r\nhowever, so extremely probable as to be for practical purposes\r\ncertain, that water contaminated with the discharges from persons\r\nsuffering from certain diseases will produce similar diseases in those\r\nwho drink it, and there is also enough evidence that water containing\r\nfilth of various kinds either produces or promotes disease to warrant\r\nmuch more attention to this subject than has heretofore been bestowed\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe chemical examination of a suspected water is by no means a simple\r\nprocess, and in most cases had better be referred to an expert in such\r\nmatters. It is highly desirable, however, that the physician should\r\nhave sufficient technical knowledge to be able to make a rough\r\nanalysis at least, if for no other reason than that he may be able to\r\nappreciate the results reported by the chemist. As a rule, when a\r\nwater is so polluted with decomposing organic matter as to be\r\npositively dangerous it will have an unpleasant odor, which is best\r\ndeveloped by half filling a quart bottle with the water to be examined\r\nand shaking it thoroughly. The so-called simple and ready methods\r\nwhich are from time to time advocated in the newspapers, such as the\r\naddition of sugar to the suspected water and allowing fermentation to\r\ntake place, the use of tannin as a precipitant, or the decolorization\r\nof a solution of potassium permanganate, are really of very little\r\nvalue and should not be relied upon. In the hands of an expert the\r\nbest simple method of determining the quality of a water is by\r\nevaporation of a known quantity and the ignition of the solid residue.\r\nFrom the amount of the total residue, the quantity left after\r\nignition, the amount of blackening produced, and the odor, a very fair\r\nopinion can be formed as to the amount of organic matter present, and\r\nwhether it is of animal or vegetable origin.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the province of this paper to describe the methods\r\nused by chemists in water analysis, of which the principal are known\r\nas the Franklin and Armstrong, the Wanklyn, and the permanganate\r\nmethods. A careful examination of these methods has recently been made\r\nunder the direction of the National Board of Health, and a preliminary\r\nnote of the results, prepared by Professor Mallet, has been published\r\nin the _Bulletin_. From this it appears that the chief value of\r\nchemical analysis is, first, the verification of gross pollution,\r\nwhich will usually be detected by the appearance and smell of the\r\nwater; and, second, in periodical examination of a water-supply to\r\ndetect changes from the normal or usual character of the water, which\r\nmay be taken to have a certain local standard of purity. Special\r\nimportance is attached to the careful determination of {184} nitrates\r\nand nitrites in water to be used for drinking, these being the results\r\nof oxidation of organic matters, and therefore giving evidence of\r\nprevious contamination.\r\n\r\nProf. Mallet concludes that \"there are no sound grounds on which to\r\nestablish such general standards of purity as have been proposed,\r\nlooking to exact amounts of organic carbon or nitrogen, albuminoid\r\nammonia, oxygen of permanganate consumed, etc., as permissible or not.\r\nDistinctions drawn by the application of such standards are arbitrary\r\nand may be misleading.\" While this is perfectly true, considered from\r\nthe standpoint of scientific precision, it does not sufficiently take\r\ninto account the value of probabilities in these matters, considered\r\nas motives to action. It is perfectly true that there can be no fixed\r\nstandard--that a water which the chemist would report as relatively\r\npure might be much more apt to produce disease than one which he would\r\npronounce impure--but it is nevertheless true that from the results of\r\nchemical analysis, taken in connection with evidence as to the source\r\nand history of the water, an opinion can be formed as to the danger\r\nfrom its use which is sufficiently reliable to be acted upon in the\r\nabsence of positive evidence, such as the production of disease.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the matter must be doubtful, and Prof. Mallet truly says\r\nthat it will not do in all such cases to forbid the use of the water,\r\nfor it often happens that this should not be done unless it is\r\nabsolutely necessary; but there are many other cases in which there is\r\nvery little doubt, and where action should be governed by the\r\nprobabilities.\r\n\r\nThe microscopical examination of suspected waters sometimes gives\r\ndecided indication as to the nature of the impurities; and it may be\r\nthat hereafter, in connection with physiological tests, it will become\r\nof even more importance than the chemical. To determine the presence\r\nof organisms in a sample of water the best method known at present is\r\nto kill and coagulate them by means of osmic acid or chloride of\r\nplatinum, and allow them to subside. This method is of course\r\ninapplicable if it be desired to use them for either culture- or\r\ninoculation-tests.\r\n\r\nChemists have no uniform system of reporting the results of their\r\nanalyses, some using grains per gallon, U.S. or Imperial as may be,\r\nand others parts per hundred thousand or per million of the water. It\r\nis therefore difficult to appreciate the value of the figures as given\r\nby them. The following, in parts per 100,000, will enable the\r\npractitioner to form a general estimate of the character of analytical\r\nreports; but the opinion in individual cases is so modified by the\r\ncoincident amounts of chlorine, ammonia, nitrous and nitric acids,\r\nthat the experienced sanitarian only is qualified to put on the\r\nresults an estimate which shall be in accordance with our present\r\nknowledge of such matter:\r\n\r\n  _Upland Surface-Waters_.\r\n                          Allowable.

Disease has been traced to impure ice, and it may be that it\r\nis more frequently due to this cause than has heretofore been\r\nsupposed; at all events, it is well to bear the possibility in mind.\r\n\r\nThe subject of impure water will be further considered in speaking of\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\nIV. CLIMATE.--The literature of the effects of different climates upon\r\nthe human body is very extensive, following the general rule that the\r\nless positive or precise knowledge there is upon a given subject the\r\nmore will be written about it. Of all animals, man seems to adapt\r\nhimself most readily to the extremes of climate; and, although it is\r\ncommonly supposed that a tropical climate is injurious to those coming\r\nfrom cooler regions, yet it has been found that where he takes the\r\nsame precautions to ensure cleanliness, pure water and air, and proper\r\nfood, the European does not have a higher rate of mortality in Algeria\r\nor in the East or West Indies than he does at home, if the effects of\r\ncholera and yellow fever be excepted.\r\n\r\nDr. Parkes defines the effect of climate upon the human body to be\r\n\"the sum of the influences which are connected with the solar\r\nagencies, the soil, the air, or the water of a place;\" in other words,\r\nhe makes it nearly equivalent to the locality or the environment. By\r\n\"climate\" we understand, commonly, the sum of meteorological\r\ninfluences, the most important of which, as regards health, are\r\ntemperature, humidity, and wind. The effects of temperature in\r\nproducing disease are often confounded with the effects of change of\r\ntemperature, which last is perhaps the more important of the two, and\r\nshould be specially borne in mind in advising climato-therapy for\r\nchronic or wasting diseases.\r\n\r\nThe influence of climate in causing disease, although well known for\r\nover two thousand years, has not led to much effort to avoid or\r\nprevent effects which are accepted as inevitable by the great\r\nmajority. It is true that in the effort to secure physical comfort by\r\nhouses, clothing, artificial heat, and the like, much hygienic work\r\nhas been done, and the steadily increasing tendency on the part of all\r\nwho can afford it to seek rest and comfort at the seaside or in the\r\nmountains during hot weather is no doubt due, in part, to the fact\r\nthat experience has shown that the money expended in thus securing\r\nhealth and strength is a good investment. It is unfortunate that\r\n\"health resorts,\" so called, do not always prove to be such: they\r\nbecome fashionable, overcrowded; the arrangements for the disposal of\r\nexcreta are cheap makeshifts, leading to soil- and water-pollution,\r\nuntil finally an epidemic of diarrhoea or typhoid fever occurs, with\r\nthe usual results.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of climate as a therapeutic agent belongs with the\r\narticles relating to the several diseases to which it is applicable.\r\nThe great desideratum wherewith to place this subject upon a\r\nscientific and practical basis is a system of reliable returns of the\r\ndeaths, and if possible of {186} certain diseases, throughout the\r\ncountry, and especially at those points most in vogue as health\r\nresorts.\r\n\r\nV. HABITATIONS.--That a man's health depends very much on the\r\ncharacter, condition, and location of his dwelling-place is now so\r\ngenerally admitted that in many cases where a physician is called in\r\nhe will be asked whether he thinks the disease has been caused by any\r\npeculiarity about the house or the bedroom of the patient. And a\r\ncareful examination will usually discover in one of them several evils\r\nto be remedied, although their connection with the case in hand may be\r\nvery doubtful. There are very few homes properly constructed from a\r\nsanitary point of view; and, although we may not agree with Dr.\r\nWilson, that \"the modern prison is in all sanitary essentials the best\r\nexisting type of what a healthy dwelling ought to be,\" it is\r\nnevertheless certain that the health of the inmates is much more\r\ncarefully consulted in planning a penitentiary than it usually is in\r\nplanning a college, a hotel, or a dwelling-house. Matters are\r\ngradually improving in this respect: the worst of the tenement-house\r\nrookeries and fever-nests in most of our large cities have been\r\nimproved or abolished, and our wealthier citizens are beginning to pay\r\nsome attention to their house-drainage as well as to the pattern of\r\ntheir mantelpieces. But the great majority of men are still careless\r\nand negligent as to the sanitary condition of their homes, and\r\nprobably two physicians out of three live in houses in which numerous\r\ndefects would be pointed out by a sanitary engineer--defects of which\r\nthey are themselves more or less aware. The majority of people in our\r\nlarge cities under existing conditions cannot afford to have healthy\r\nhouses, and the great causes of the excessive mortality, and brevity\r\nof life, in all such cities, are poverty and overcrowding, the latter\r\nresulting from the former. The problem as to the best mode of\r\nimproving the sanitary condition of the tenement-house population does\r\nnot, however, come before the practising physician for special\r\nconsideration, and need not be considered here. Nor is the physician\r\nliable to be consulted with regard to the sufficiency, from a sanitary\r\npoint of view, of the plan of a house yet to be built, although he\r\nwill occasionally be asked as to the healthfulness of a proposed site.\r\nThe questions which he will be asked are such as the following: \"Is\r\nthe cause of this particular case of disease in the house, or\r\nconnected with it? and if so, what is it?\"--\"Do you think this is a\r\nhealthy house?\"--\"Is the location a healthy one?\"--\"Is it necessary\r\nthat I should give up this house to preserve the lives and health of\r\nmy children?\" While it is, of course, often impossible to answer with\r\nprecision such questions as these, an answer of some kind must be\r\ngiven; and this should not be a mere random guess, but based on a\r\ndeliberate estimate of the probabilities in the case. The\r\nhealthfulness of a house is to be judged of, in part, from its\r\nhistory, if it be possible to obtain any; in part, from such facts as\r\ncan be discovered by a careful examination of the premises and\r\nvicinity. The sanitary history of a house is the history of the\r\ndiseases and deaths which have occurred in it, together with a set of\r\nplans showing the precise location and character of the house-drainage\r\nand of its fresh-air supply. Such a record is in most cases,\r\nunfortunately, not attainable, although to a person proposing to buy\r\nor rent a house it would often be quite as important as a record of\r\ntitle. In a well-organized health-office it should be possible to\r\nascertain the number and causes of the deaths which have {187}\r\noccurred in any given house or square in the city, and also the\r\ncharacter and location of its drainage and sewer connections. Such\r\nrecords are especially valuable in an investigation of an outbreak of\r\ndisease in a community.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary inspection of a house includes the site and the building\r\nitself. The character of the site is mainly determined by its dryness,\r\nby the presence or absence of organic matter in the soil, and by its\r\nporosity taken in connection with the character of the vicinity.\r\nOne-third of the volume of some soils consists of air, and all dry\r\nsoils and rocks contain a much larger quantity of air than is commonly\r\nsupposed. The influence of soil upon health is exerted mainly through\r\nthe media of water and air, but it also affects temperature and\r\nvegetation, being an important factor in climate. Residence on a damp\r\nsoil has a tendency to produce diseases of the lungs, and especially\r\nphthisis; but how it does this is unknown, though it would be easy to\r\nconstruct a plausible theory in connection with the supposed causation\r\nof phthisis by a bacillus. The practical point for the physician is,\r\nthat the prevalence of phthisis in a locality, even if it be so\r\nlimited as to comprise but a single house, should cause suspicion and\r\ninvestigation as to the character of the soil-drainage. Soil-moisture\r\nis also an important factor in the development of periodical fevers,\r\nand the effect of thorough drainage in diminishing malaria is now\r\ngenerally understood.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes becomes an important question as to the influence which a\r\ncollection of water, such as a mill-pond or a reservoir, has upon the\r\nhealth of a community, and the physician may be called on for an\r\nopinion in such cases where large property interests are involved. The\r\nessential points to be borne in mind are--first, that stagnant water\r\nand damp soil do not in themselves produce malaria; there is something\r\nelse necessary, which is commonly designated by the word \"germ.\"\r\nSecond, that they are in most cases essential conditions for the\r\nproduction of the disease, so that if removed the disease will\r\ndisappear. Third, that the development of malaria may follow either\r\nthe rise or fall of the ground water. Fourth, that the condition of\r\nthe border of the collection of water as to presence of organic matter\r\nand moisture is of more importance than the pool itself. And, finally,\r\nthat each case is a problem by itself, to be determined by the history\r\nof the sickness of the vicinity, and that only probabilities can be\r\nstated in any case, although these probabilities may be so great as to\r\namount, practically, to certainty. Of the four factors which appear to\r\nbe essential to the production of the malarial poison--viz. moisture,\r\nhigh temperature, organic matter of vegetable origin, and certain\r\nmicro-organisms--the first is the one which in any given locality is\r\nmost under human control; it is the link in the chain of causation\r\nwhich is most easily broken.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the rise and fall of the soil water in typhoid fever,\r\nupon which so much stress is laid by Pettenkofer and others, no doubt\r\nexists, acting in some cases through pollution of the drinking water\r\nby the subsoil water leaking through a polluted soil; in other cases,\r\nperhaps, by air from the soil bearing the unknown germ. The filtering\r\npower of soil as regards air is, however, very great, a few inches of\r\nsand being sufficient to remove the ordinary germs of putrefaction\r\nfrom air drawn through it, and this for a long period; while, on the\r\n{188} contrary, many feet of the same sand will not remove the germs\r\nfrom water passed through it. Usually, as Dr. Parkes remarks, in an\r\nexamination of soil the immediate local conditions are of more\r\nimportance than the general geological formation, yet this last, as\r\ninfluencing conformation and the movement of water and air over and\r\nthrough a country, is also important. The practical questions on this\r\npoint are, what higher ground than the site in question exists in the\r\nvicinity? what are the character and direction of the strata between\r\nsuch elevation and the site? and, what sources of soil-pollution exist\r\non the higher level? As to the site itself, is it on made ground? what\r\nis the height of the foundation above the subsoil water? and, what\r\nprecautions have been taken to secure drainage and to cut off\r\ncommunication between the interior of the house and the ground air?\r\nProbably a trial excavation or boring may be necessary to determine\r\nsome of these points.\r\n\r\nThe level of the subsoil water should be at least five feet below the\r\nfoundations, although it is often impossible to obtain this. At all\r\ntimes when the temperature of the house is higher than that of the\r\nexternal air--_i.e._ during a large part of the year and nearly every\r\nnight--there is a strong and constant aspirating force at work to draw\r\ninto the house, through the cellar floor and walls, all gases and\r\nvapors contained in the adjoining soil. If this soil contains a large\r\nproportion of organic matter, as is often the case in filled-in ground\r\nin cities, or if there be a leaky cesspool or sewer or gas-pipe under\r\nor near the house, the ground air passing into the house may be of\r\nsuch a character as to be positively dangerous to its occupants. For\r\nthis reason it is very undesirable to have a sewer or soil-pipe\r\ncrossing beneath the site of a house, and when such location is a\r\nnecessity, as it often is in cities, the soil-pipe should be laid in a\r\ncement-lined trench covered with a movable flap, so that it can always\r\nbe easily inspected and any leaks detected and remedied. Dampness in\r\nthe cellar or basement of a house is always a sign of danger. The\r\nexhalation of gases and vapors from the ground into the house can be\r\nto a great extent cut off by a layer of impervious material, such as\r\nconcrete covered with asphalt, but this layer must cover the sides of\r\nthe cellar as well as the floor to be thoroughly efficient. If a house\r\nhave no cellar, the space between the floor and the ground should be\r\nthoroughly ventilated; and for this purpose, as well as to secure\r\ncleanliness, the floor should be sufficiently elevated to permit of\r\neasy access beneath it.\r\n\r\nNext to its dryness, the nature and condition of the arrangements for\r\nremoving excreta and soiled water from a house are of the greatest\r\nimportance in determining its healthfulness; and in cities it is with\r\nregard to the sufficiency of these, including the whole system of\r\nhouse-plumbing and pipe-fitting, that the inquiries of one wishing to\r\ndetermine as to the presence or absence of causes of disease will most\r\nfrequently be directed. The soil-pipes, etc. of a house are commonly\r\nreferred to as constituting the system of house-drainage, but it is\r\ndesirable to use another term, for we need the word \"drainage\" to\r\ndescribe the removal of surface and subsoil water, and it should be\r\ndistinguished from \"sewerage,\" which has a different purpose and\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nIn a properly-arranged system of house sewerage all the pipes, traps,\r\netc. are easily accessible for purposes of inspection, and an\r\nexamination of them is a comparatively simple matter. This examination\r\nis to be {189} made with reference to the following points: 1. Are all\r\nthe pipes, joints, and connections air-tight? 2. Is the soil-pipe well\r\nventilated, or has it dead ends? 3. Is the communication between the\r\nsoil-pipe and the street sewer uninterrupted? 4. Are the pipes\r\nproperly trapped, and is there liability to the removal of water from\r\nany of the traps, either by siphonage or evaporation, to such an\r\nextent as to break the seal? 5. Is the water-supply of each closet\r\nentirely cut off from the main supply to the house by means of a tank\r\nor cistern?\r\n\r\nIn houses as heretofore constructed it is often very difficult to\r\nobtain satisfactory information upon these points, because a large\r\npart of the soil-pipe and its connections is buried beneath the house\r\nor concealed in the walls or floors; in which case the services of a\r\nskilled mechanic will usually be necessary to obtain access to the\r\nvarious parts of the system. In a paper of this kind it is of course\r\nimpossible to go into details as to methods of inspection, or as to\r\nwhat is and what is not satisfactory; but the following are the\r\ngeneral principles upon which a judgment as to the merits of a system\r\nshould be formed, and these should be so clearly understood by every\r\nphysician that he can be neither persuaded nor frightened into\r\nthinking them incorrect by the eloquence of the man with a patent\r\nremedy to dispose of. The principal dangers to health from house\r\nsewerage are due, first, to the passage of air from the general system\r\nof sewers or from a cesspool into the house through the soil-pipe and\r\nits connections; second, to the generation of offensive and dangerous\r\ngases and organisms in the soil-pipe itself, and the passage of these\r\ninto the house; third, to leakage of soil-pipe causing contamination\r\nof the water-supply either by improper connections of water-pipes with\r\nwater-closets or slop-hoppers, or by contamination of wells, cisterns,\r\nor tanks with sewage or sewer gases.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no such thing as a sewer gas having a definite\r\nand distinctive composition, and the nature of the mixture of gases in\r\nsewers is constantly varying according to season, temperature, etc.\r\nThe tendency which sewer air has to cause disease depends in part upon\r\ncertain gases, in part on minute particles of solid or semi-solid\r\nmatter which are suspended in the air. In rare instances the sewers\r\nalso contain illuminating gas, derived from leakage of gas-pipes in\r\nthe vicinity. These gases produce debility, headache, loss of\r\nappetite, etc. As found in sewers and soil-pipes, they are so diluted\r\nthat they are not absorbed by the water of a trap and given off on the\r\nother side to a sufficient extent to produce an evil effect. The air\r\nin a soil-pipe which is not ventilated is much more impure than that\r\nof the ordinary sewer, since the process of decomposition is\r\nconstantly going on in the slimy coat which lines the interior of the\r\npipes; and it is for this reason that it is so important to secure\r\nthorough ventilation of all the soil-pipes in a building. When this\r\nventilation is secured, the proportion of dangerous gas in the pipes\r\nbecomes very small, and the amount absorbed by the water in traps is\r\nalmost inappreciable. The chief danger to life from sewer and\r\nsoil-pipe air arises from the presence of minute particles of organic\r\nmatter, dead and living, the so-called germs. Danger to life from\r\nthese germs cannot be entirely removed by dilution, as can be done\r\nwith gases. It has been found by the experiments of Dr. Carmichael and\r\nDr. Wernick that an ordinary water-trap entirely prevents the passage\r\nof these germs, and that organic putrescible fluid will remain\r\nunchanged when exposed only to the air immediately {190} above such a\r\ntrap. A pin-hole or minute sand-crack in the soil-pipe, or a very\r\nslight defect in a joint, is far more dangerous than a trap.\r\n\r\nThe forms of disease produced by sewer air and its contents are more\r\nespecially diphtheria, typhoid fever, and ill-defined disorders of the\r\nthroat and digestive organs. It is possible that the germs of other\r\nspecific diseases, such as scarlet fever, may be at times transmitted\r\nthrough sewer air, but such transmission must be very rare. While it\r\nis true that the germs of the specific diseases are very rarely\r\npresent in sewer air, the house system of sewerage must be arranged as\r\nif they were always present, in order to obtain security. It must also\r\nbe remembered that a system originally well planned and properly\r\nconstructed will not always remain so; the pipes will corrode, the\r\njoints will become loosened, the valves will become clogged, and\r\nwhenever alterations or repairs are made there is always danger of\r\ninjury. Bearing these points in mind, the method of investigating a\r\nsystem can be readily understood.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to ascertain whether there is a trap outside the\r\nhouse disconnecting the sewer from the house system and permitting\r\ninspection. If there is not, the first thing to be done is to make an\r\nexcavation and open the drain at the proper point for placing such a\r\ntrap. The next step is to set the water flowing in the various closets\r\nand watch the flow at the external trap, or opening, which has been\r\nmade to ascertain whether there is any obstruction in the pipe within\r\nthe house. If the sewer is properly arranged for inspection, as has\r\nbeen above suggested, to determine whether there is any leakage from\r\nthe sewer under the house will be an easy matter; if, however, it is\r\nburied beneath the cellar floor, as is usually the case, an excavation\r\nshould be made along the floor in the line of the pipe, with a view to\r\nhaving it properly arranged, as well as for the purpose of examining\r\nthe soil. It may also be tested by opening the upright soil-pipes at\r\nthe farther end of the house-drain at the height of three or four feet\r\nabove the floor and pouring water into it, having temporarily stopped\r\nup the drain at the external trap or opening. If the water remain at a\r\nconstant level in the upright piece, the sewer is water-tight; if not,\r\nthe leakage may be ascertained by the rate at which it sinks. Having\r\nsettled this, the next point is to determine whether all the\r\nsoil-pipes are air-tight and properly trapped. The test usually\r\napplied for this purpose is the pouring of a small quantity of strong\r\noil of peppermint, followed by a dash of hot water, into the top of\r\nthe soil-pipe, which should always pass through the roof and be freely\r\nopened to the outer air. If the odor of the oil is perceptible in the\r\nhouse, it indicates a leak, which must be further sought for. Ether\r\nmay be used for the same purpose. The smoke test is, however, the\r\nbest, but it requires a special apparatus which as yet is little used\r\nin this country. It is applied by a small machine with a fan, by which\r\nthe smoke from burning cotton-waste saturated with oil, or of coarse\r\nbrown paper impregnated with sulphur, can be blown into the pipes;\r\nthis locates leaks with great precision.\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, expected that a physician will personally make\r\nthe examination necessary to determine whether the plumbing of a house\r\nis in good order, but he should be able to make it, if necessary, if\r\nfor no other purpose than to know whether the inspector employed for\r\nthe purpose understands his business.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to health from a properly-constructed system of house\r\n{191} sewerage, such as is now generally agreed upon by sanitary\r\nengineers, are so very small as to practically amount to nothing,\r\nbeing, in fact, less than those of a well-kept yard privy of a country\r\nhouse, setting aside altogether the question of water pollution. The\r\nreal difficulties in the way are the expense of such a system, which\r\nis considerable, and the finding of skilled and honest workmen to\r\nconstruct it and keep it in repair. Not every one who chooses to style\r\nhimself a sanitary engineer or a sanitary plumber is to be regarded as\r\nsuch, by any means, but the physician should make it his business to\r\nknow who are really reliable in this respect, for he will constantly\r\nbe called in for advice on this point by those who have learned that\r\ngood plumbing is the only true economy, but who do not feel themselves\r\ncompetent to distinguish between good and bad work. The main points of\r\na satisfactory system are the following.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For further details consult the following: _American\r\nSanitary Engineering_, by E. S. Philbrick, N.Y., 1881; _House-Drainage\r\nand Water-Service_, by James C. Bayles, N.Y., 1878; \"House-Drainage\r\nand Sanitary Plumbing,\" by W. P. Gerhard, in _Fourth Annual Report\r\nState Board of Health Rhode Island_, 1882; _The Sanitary Engineer_, a\r\nweekly journal published at 140 William St., New York City.]\r\n\r\n1. All soil- and waste-pipes should be extended up to and through the\r\nroof, and be freely open at the top. The extension of the soil-pipe\r\nshould be full size--_i.e._ from four to six inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n2. There should be a fresh-air inlet in the house sewer just outside\r\nthe house, and between this inlet and the main sewer should be a trap\r\nso arranged as to permit of inspection. This prevents the ventilation\r\nof sewers through the soil-pipes. If a perfect system of sewers,\r\nuniformity of house-connections, and uniform height of houses could be\r\nguaranteed, this inlet and trap would not be so necessary, although\r\neven then it would be useful.\r\n\r\n3. Every water-closet, wash-bowl, bath-tub, sink, etc. should have a\r\ntrap placed as close to it as possible. This trap is desirable,\r\nwhether the discharge be into the sewer system or not. For example, a\r\nkitchen sink, the pipe from which passes to the outer air and\r\ndischarges there, should be trapped, for this pipe is foul, and if it\r\nbe untrapped will act as an air-inlet.\r\n\r\n4. The nearer to the soil-pipe that the fixtures can be arranged the\r\nbetter. It is especially desirable to avoid the necessity for long\r\nhorizontal waste-pipes from stationary waste-bowls and from bath-tubs.\r\n\r\n5. Bell traps, D traps, bottle traps, and mechanical traps are\r\nobjectionable. The S trap is, upon the whole, the best, but it should\r\nbe provided with a vent-pipe to prevent siphonage.\r\n\r\n6. The best kind of water-closet for general use is probably some form\r\nof what are known as the wash-out closets. They are made in one piece\r\nof earthenware, have no machinery inside them, have a quantity of\r\nwater in the basin into which the excreta drop, and do not require a\r\nseparate trap beneath them. Each closet must, however, be carefully\r\ntested by itself: a very small warp or twist produced in the baking\r\nmay so interfere with the siphonage as to make it practically\r\nworthless, and the basin cannot be altered or repaired. For use in\r\npublic places some of the hopper closets are very satisfactory, the\r\nbest which I have examined being the Rhoads Hopper and the Hellyer\r\nHoppers. Where there are no {192} children, and it is certain that the\r\nfixtures will be used with reasonable care, valve closets may be used.\r\nNo form of pan closet can be considered as satisfactory, nor have I\r\nfound any form of plunger closet that I would specially recommend.\r\n\r\n7. Water-closets should always be flushed from a special tank provided\r\nfor the purpose, and never direct from the main system of water-pipes.\r\nThe flush must be large and rapid, and this requires a large\r\nsupply-pipe, and for many forms of closets a flushing rim. Whatever be\r\nthe form of closet, it should not be encased in a wooden box or\r\ncloset, as is usually done, but it should stand freely exposed to\r\nlight and air. Sanitarians commonly advise that water-closets should\r\nbe located in outer walls and have an open window for ventilation.\r\nSuch a position is usually impossible, and is not specially desirable\r\nin our climate. The open window acts as an inlet quite as often as it\r\ndoes as an outlet, and the air of the closet is thus swept into the\r\nhouse. The room should be ventilated in such a way that the tendency\r\nof the air at the door shall always be from the house into it. This is\r\nto be effected by a shaft passing through the room up and through the\r\nroof; and it is well to have this shaft take its air-supply from just\r\nbehind the closet or from beneath the seat. It is best made of\r\ngalvanized iron, and at a convenient point should be expanded into a\r\nlantern and have a gas-jet placed in it. The air-supply for the closet\r\nis to be taken at the bottom of the door or through a transom or\r\nlouvres. Ventilating pipes from a water-closet should never be run\r\ninto a brick flue. While it is not so important as many writers seem\r\nto think that a water-closet should be placed on an outer wall, it is\r\nvery important that it should be as light as possible, and the placing\r\nit in a dark corner in the basement or under the stairs is very\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\n8. No overflow-pipe from any cistern or tank, except the one used for\r\nflushing water-closets, should be connected with the soil-pipe or\r\nsewer. Trapping such an overflow-pipe does not prevent the danger. The\r\nsame rule applies to waste-pipes from refrigerators and to the\r\nwaste-pipes from the safes which are commonly placed beneath fixtures.\r\n\r\n9. Grease-traps placed inside a house--for instance, beneath the\r\nkitchen sink--are of very doubtful expediency, and if they cannot be\r\nplaced outside, they had better not be used at all.\r\n\r\nIn an unsewered city one of the first things to be considered in a\r\nsanitary inspection is the manner in which the sewage of the premises\r\nis disposed of. The question is, however, by no means superfluous in\r\nmany sewered cities, for cesspools and vaults are to be found in most\r\nof them, and not only in yards, but beneath houses, and houses of the\r\nbetter class. A privy-vault or cesspool beneath a dwelling or near its\r\ncellar walls is always to be considered as very dangerous, for it is\r\npractically impossible to prevent the passage of gases from it into\r\nthe interior of the house. A cesspit is a dangerous thing anywhere,\r\neven in the country; but in a city it is so dangerous that its\r\nexistence should not be permitted.\r\n\r\nIf the water-supply of a house is derived from a well, and there is\r\nreason to suspect that this may have been contaminated from a\r\nneighboring privy-vault, the first test to be applied to the water is\r\nthat for the detection of chlorides. If none are present, the water is\r\nnot polluted. If they are present, the quantity is to be noted, and a\r\npeck or two of common salt is then to be thrown into the suspected\r\nvault. If repeated {193} examinations of the water show a marked\r\nincrease in the amount of chlorides present, it may be inferred that\r\nthe contents of the privy pass to the well. The fact that the water of\r\ninfected wells and springs is usually much liked and sought for is to\r\na considerable extent due to the presence of these chlorides. Wanklyn\r\nrecommends the addition of 50 grains of common salt per gallon to\r\ndrinking water to render it palatable. Popularity of a certain well is\r\ntherefore a reason for suspecting its purity.\r\n\r\nThis subject may be dismissed with one caution. Taking the\r\ndwelling-houses of a city or town as they come, it will be found on\r\nexamination that over half of them would be described by a competent\r\ninspector as being in a condition which might produce disease. It is\r\ntherefore more than an even chance that in any case of disease some\r\nsanitary defect will be found about the premises quite irrespective of\r\nany direct causal connection with the case. Let the physician\r\ntherefore be cautious in deciding as to such causal connection, and\r\nnot conclude that because a case of diphtheria or typhoid fever and a\r\nleaky soil-pipe occur in the same house, therefore one is the cause of\r\nthe other. Such cases occur in houses whose sewerage is perfect and in\r\nhouses which have no sewerage, and it is folly to attribute them\r\nexclusively or mainly to sewer gases.\r\n\r\nThe same caution applies to investigations into the causes of a sudden\r\noutbreak of disease in a community where a number of cases occur\r\nalmost simultaneously or in rapid succession. Such an outbreak may be\r\ndue to direct contagion, although sometimes very difficult to trace;\r\nas, for example, an explosion of small-pox in a community largely\r\nunprotected by vaccination, and where, owing to circumstances\r\nconnected with the first few cases, a large number of persons have\r\nbeen exposed to the cause about the same time. The same applies to an\r\napparently sudden development of yellow fever throughout a city.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of such outbreaks is a polluted water-supply, as in some\r\nepidemics of diarrhoeal disease or of typhoid fever. If the outbreaks\r\nof these diseases are pretty sharply localized, and depend upon the\r\nfouling of a well or wells, it will usually not be very difficult to\r\ntrace this cause. If, however, the town has water-supply by means of\r\npipes from a single source, while the outbreak of disease is limited\r\nto a part of the town or to a single large building, it will probably\r\nbe almost impossible to establish any connection between the disease\r\nand the drinking water. The possibility of the contamination of a part\r\nonly of a system of general water-supply by means of the drawing of\r\nfoul air into the temporarily empty pipes connected directly with a\r\nwater-closet flush should never be forgotten, for such a case has\r\nactually occurred, and the account of its discovery is one of the best\r\npieces of sanitary detective work with which I am acquainted. If the\r\noutbreak of typhoid fever cannot be traced directly to the\r\nwater-supply, the next point to be investigated is the milk, and after\r\nthat other possible modes of the conveyance of the contagium.\r\n\r\nIn cases of obscure disease characterized by fever of no definite\r\ntype, disorder of the digestive organs, headache, malaise, etc., and\r\nwhich seem to be connected with residence in a particular house or in\r\none room in a house, the possibilities of arsenical poisoning from\r\nwall-paper or hangings should be remembered, for much useless\r\nmedication and some real danger will be avoided if this cause be\r\npromptly recognized. The effects {194} produced by arsenical dust are\r\nvery various, and simulate sometimes some of the specific fevers,\r\nindigestions, or neuroses in a way that is very puzzling if the true\r\nnature of the case is not suspected. The popular notion is that\r\narsenic is found only in greens (more especially in bright greens in\r\nwall-papers), whereas in fact it is found not only in dull greens, but\r\nin some browns, grays, and dull reds. The test for its presence in\r\nquantity sufficient to be a cause of disease is an easy one, and is\r\nfully given in any manual of chemistry or toxicology.\r\n\r\nVI. OCCUPATION.--While the effects of occupation upon health are no\r\ndoubt great, they are in many cases so blended with those of condition\r\nin life, including habitation, food, and intemperance, that it is very\r\ndifficult to distinguish them. In attempting to investigate these\r\neffects by means of statistics, it is necessary to beware of a fallacy\r\nwhich not unfrequently vitiates the conclusions drawn from otherwise\r\ncarefully prepared tables intended to show for different occupations\r\neither the relative mortality or the average age at death. This\r\nfallacy lies in the fact that the number of persons engaged in each\r\nbusiness is unknown; that, in this country at least, men often change\r\ntheir occupations; and that certain trades or professions are chiefly\r\ncarried on by persons of certain ages. This last is perhaps best\r\nillustrated by the remark of Dr. Farr, that the fact that the average\r\nage at death of second lieutenants is much less than that of\r\nmajor-generals proves nothing with regard to the comparative\r\nhealthfulness of the two grades. Statistics showing merely the number\r\nof a particular class or grade dying in a given time are absolutely\r\nworthless, unless the number of the same class or trade living at the\r\nsame time is also given.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to bear in mind the power of habit and the\r\neffects of natural selection, especially when the effects of an\r\nunhealthy occupation are immediate and marked upon those unfitted for\r\nthem. For example, young men, when first employed as scavengers or in\r\nsewage-pumping works, usually suffer from disorders of the digestive\r\norgans. A certain number find it necessary for their health and\r\ncomfort to soon leave the business; some acquire protection by passing\r\nthrough an attack of fever; and by this process of selection a class\r\nof men are obtained who seem to thrive in the midst of filth and\r\nremain unaffected by effluvia which will promptly cause illness in\r\nthose unaccustomed to them. When men find that, to use a common\r\nphrase, they \"cannot stand\" a particular kind of work, they are apt to\r\ngive it up and try something else, especially if the effects are\r\nprompt and well marked.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given of late years in England, France, and\r\nGermany to the means of protecting both the workmen and the\r\nneighborhood from the ill effects of dangerous and offensive trades,\r\nand the reports of the medical officer of the Privy Council and of the\r\nLocal Government Board are a mine of information on this subject. It\r\nmay be truthfully asserted that in those trades in which the special\r\ndanger is caused by dust of various kinds, or by gases, or by metallic\r\npoisons--and these three include the greater number of the dangerous\r\noccupations--it is almost always possible to so arrange the work as to\r\nmake it comparatively healthful and harmless. Overcrowded and\r\nunventilated workrooms are responsible for much disease, and when to\r\nthese is added the risk of metallic poisoning, as is the case with\r\nprinters, artificial-flower {195} makers, etc., bad results are almost\r\nsure to follow. It is curious that so comparatively little ill effect\r\nseems to be produced by exposure to great heat, as in stokers,\r\nfoundry-men, glass-blowers, etc.; but further information is needed on\r\nthis point as to the real facts in the case. In some occupations the\r\nchief evils arise from want of out-door exercise, a subject which will\r\nbe considered presently. The want of useful or interesting occupation\r\nsometimes becomes indirectly the cause of disease among the wealthier\r\nclasses, and the giving a man or woman something to do is in such\r\ncases the best prescription which can be made. This danger is\r\nespecially apt to occur in the case of an active, energetic man who\r\nretires from business, intending to spend the rest of his life in\r\npleasure and in the enjoyment of the fruits of his industry: the\r\npreventive or remedy is obvious.\r\n\r\nVII. FOOD.--The comfort, energy, usefulness, and moral character of a\r\nman depend largely upon his digestion, and this in turn depends\r\nlargely on what it has to act upon--viz. food. There are, it is true,\r\nmany men who boast that they can digest anything, and who are really\r\ncomparatively indifferent as to the kind, or mode of preparation, of\r\nthe food set before them, so that the quantity be sufficient; but were\r\nit not that habit and heredity--which is the family habit--combine\r\nwith natural selection to adapt men to their food, it is probable that\r\nthe frying-pan, the pie, and soda-bread would depopulate large\r\nportions of this country. As it is, there can be no doubt that fried\r\nfood swimming in grease, leathery, sodden pie-crust, and heavy bread\r\ntend to make life short and the reverse of merry; and when the effect\r\nof these is combined, as it often is, with those of malaria, damp\r\nsoil, and a free use of whiskey, the result is plenty of work for the\r\ndoctor and very little to pay him with. This state of things is being\r\ngradually improved, but in all classes of society and in almost all\r\nparts of the country the rule is, that while the raw materials of food\r\nare abundant and of excellent quality, the cooking is bad. This is\r\ndue, in part, to an idea that it is to a certain extent discreditable\r\nto a person that he should give much attention to his food, at least\r\nso far as its appearance and taste are concerned, and that a man who\r\ncan plan a good dinner must be more or less of a sensualist and a\r\nglutton.\r\n\r\nAnother popular error is, that a large amount of disease is due to\r\novereating, and that abstemiousness in diet is either certain to\r\nsecure health, or is, at all events, indispensable for this purpose.\r\nUpon this point the reader should consult a capital paper by Dr.\r\nAustin Flint on \"Food in its relations to personal and public health,\"\r\nwhich will be found in vol. iii. _Reports American Public Health\r\nAssociation_, N.Y., 1877. After remarking that many of the popular\r\nerrors about food and diet are relics of old and abandoned medical\r\ntheories, one of which is embodied in the not uncommon advice that one\r\nshould always stop eating before the appetite is fully satisfied, and\r\nthat food should only be taken at regular fixed periods, no matter how\r\nhungry one may be, he says: \"Physiology, experience, and common sense\r\nare alike opposed to these popular notions relating to food.\r\nConditions for perfect health are, first, a sufficient appetite;\r\nsecond, the gratification of normal appetite before the want of food\r\nreaches the abnormal degree expressed by hunger; third, the\r\nsatisfaction of appetite by an adequate quantity of food. These\r\nconditions of health are fulfilled by compliance with instructive\r\nprovisions for {196} alimentation. But, it will be asked, is appetite\r\ninfallible as a guide in dietetics? Following it as a guide, is food\r\nnever taken beyond the requirements of health? I answer, It is a\r\nreliable guide under normal circumstances. The inevitable\r\ncircumstances of life are often not altogether normal, although\r\nproducing no distinct morbid affection. Experience teaches, for\r\nexample, that in a state of fatigue or exhaustion (which is not a\r\nnormal state) inconvenience may arise from the full gratification of\r\nappetite; that if unusual exertions, mental or physical, are to\r\nfollow, a hearty meal may occasion disturbance; and other examples\r\nmight be added. Irrespective of abnormal or disturbing influences, if\r\nappetite be not infallible, it is, at all events, more reliable than a\r\nrule based on theoretical ideas, popular notions, or on purely\r\nphysiological data. Moreover, it was evidently not intended that the\r\nquantity of food should be accurately adjusted to the needs of the\r\neconomy. To do this is impossible, and therefore it is necessary to\r\nelect between the risk of taking either more or less food than is\r\nactually required. Which is to be preferred? Undoubtedly, it is vastly\r\nbetter to incur the risk of taking too much than that of taking too\r\nlittle. Nature provides for a redundancy, but there is no provision\r\nagainst a persistent deficiency. Ex nihilo nihil fit. An ample supply\r\nof alimentary principles is indispensable to nutrition; and inasmuch\r\nas the supply cannot be made to contain precisely the needed amount of\r\nthe different alimentary principles, we may say that a superabundance\r\nof food is a requirement for health.\r\n\r\n\"As in appetite we have a guide in respect of the times of taking food\r\nand the quantity to be taken, so taste is a guide in respect of the\r\nkinds of food required. The discrimination of food with reference to\r\nthe wants of the system is the evident purpose of the sense of taste,\r\nand the enjoyment connected with this sense was designed to afford a\r\nsecurity, in addition to appetite, for adequate alimentation.\r\n\r\n\"Among professional men and those who live sedentary lives the mistake\r\nis not uncommon of paying too much attention to the sensations after a\r\nmeal, and deciding therefrom whether certain articles of food are\r\nunhealthy or not. If the man who does this is not already dyspeptic,\r\nhe will pretty surely become so. The remedies in this case are\r\nexercise and attracting the attention to something else.\"\r\n\r\nA physician ought to understand something of cooking, and a short\r\ncourse of practical instruction in what might be dignified as the\r\nculinary laboratory would be of more real value to him than some of\r\nthe branches which are now considered indispensable in the medical\r\ncurriculum. He should know why oysters are the best thing with which\r\nto begin a dinner, and why a cocktail is one of the worst; how to make\r\na salad, or a cup of good coffee, or a perfect consommé; and a number\r\nof other things pertaining to gastronomy of which most people are\r\nwoefully ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this paper to give details with regard\r\nto the diet of either the sick or the well, but it seems proper to\r\nremark with regard to the feeding of infants, more especially in our\r\nlarge cities in the summer months, that all the various patent\r\npreparations for infants' food are more or less pernicious, and should\r\nbe discountenanced by all medical men. The proper food of an infant is\r\nmilk--human milk if it can be had, cow's milk if it cannot. If it be\r\nremembered that an infant suffers {197} from thirst as well as hunger,\r\nand care be taken to give it enough pure cool water to quench this\r\nthirst, it will be found that in most cases it will thrive on pure\r\ncow's milk.\r\n\r\nWith regard to adulterations of food, the only form of such\r\nadulteration found in this country, which has any special interest\r\nfrom the sanitary point of view, pertains to milk. This adulteration\r\nis in most cases the dilution of the milk by water, and this is very\r\ncommon in large cities. The danger from the use of such milk is by no\r\nmeans confined to infants, and it is probable that a larger proportion\r\nof the typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, cholera infantum, and\r\ndiarrhoeal diseases in our cities is due either directly or indirectly\r\nto the milk-supply than is now even suspected. The possibility of this\r\nmode of origin should always be borne in mind in investigating the\r\ncausation of such affections.\r\n\r\nA very large amount of food is now furnished preserved in tin cans,\r\nand it is almost invariably of excellent quality. There is a\r\npossibility of the contamination of such food by the salts of lead or\r\ntin, but such contamination to an extent which is injurious to health\r\nmust be so extremely rare as to be hardly worth considering. The\r\ndanger from the entrance of parasites, such as trichinæ, etc., in the\r\nfood is also extremely small--in fact, is nothing where the food is\r\nproperly cooked.\r\n\r\nMilk has so often been the cause of disease, and is so universally\r\nused, that it seems worth while to refer to it again. The special\r\naptitude of milk for absorption of odors has long been known, and of\r\nlate years it has been clearly proven in a number of instances that\r\nmilk has been the means of conveying the cause of typhoid fever and of\r\nscarlatina. Diphtheria, yellow fever, and intermittent fever have also\r\nbeen supposed to be conveyed by milk. The variety of nutritive\r\nprinciples contained in milk, which makes it so valuable as a food,\r\nalso gives it the power of sustaining many different sorts of minute\r\norganisms, and it perhaps comes as near being a universal\r\nculture-fluid as anything yet devised for that purpose. The\r\npossibilities of the contamination of milk are so numerous, and\r\nespecially in the case of that furnished from small establishments,\r\nthat, in the case of outbreaks of typhoid or diarrhoeal diseases in a\r\ntown, investigations into causation should always include the milk- as\r\nwell as the water-supply. Milk from diseased animals is no doubt often\r\nused without producing bad results, but its effects in conveying to\r\nman the disease known as milk-sickness are well established, and it\r\nhas also been known to produce symptoms of the contagious aphthæ, or\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease, in man, when derived from an animal affected\r\nwith that disease. The only danger in the use of the milk of animals\r\nfed upon sewage-grown grass appears to be in the possible\r\ncontamination of the milk, after it is drawn, by particles of dust in\r\nthe stable, derived from the food or litter of the animal or from\r\nuncleanliness of the exterior of the udder, etc.\r\n\r\nVIII. INTEMPERANCE.--Every one knows that alcoholic drinks are the\r\ncause of a vast amount of disease, crime, and misery in all civilized\r\ncountries. No one knows how this is to be prevented, for no one knows\r\nhow to make the great mass of the people wise and contented. The\r\neffects produced by excessive use of alcohol are well known to all\r\nphysicians, and the remedy is self-evident. I see no use in adding to\r\nthe heap of useless rubbish which exists in the shape of the great\r\nmass of existing {198} popular literature on this subject, and\r\ntherefore leave the subject to the reader, who is quite sure to know\r\nall that is really important on this subject.\r\n\r\nIX. CLOTHING.--The hygiene of clothing is also a subject which may be\r\ntreated summarily in this paper. People wear what they can afford,\r\nmade according to the prevailing style. Diseases due to insufficient,\r\nexcessive, or badly-fitting clothing occur most frequently in women\r\nand children, and the use of such clothing is for the most part due to\r\npoverty or fashion, either of which is beyond the power of the\r\nphysician to successfully cope with. Here and there, in individual and\r\nexceptional cases, he may be able to do a little good by advising\r\nagainst tight lacing, high-heeled shoes, insufficient covering for the\r\nchest or legs, etc., and he will find that a knowledge of the\r\npeculiarities of the various styles of modern under-clothing will\r\nsometimes be very useful. Men are, as a rule, comfortably and sensibly\r\ndressed to suit their business and surroundings, and require no advice\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nX. EXERCISE.--The ease and completeness with which the functions of an\r\norgan or of an organism are performed depend to a great extent upon\r\nthe frequency and regularity with which such functions are exercised.\r\nHence comes the importance of bodily exercise for the preservation of\r\nhealth, and every physician meets cases of disease due largely to want\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nThe term \"exercise,\" or \"bodily exercise,\" is commonly used as if it\r\nreferred only to the muscles, and the amount of exercise which a man\r\nshould take in a day is stated as equal to a certain number of\r\nfoot-pounds. The mere giving work to muscles is not, however, exercise\r\nin the sanitary sense. A better definition is that of Du Bois\r\nReymond--viz. that \"exercise is the frequent repetition of a more or\r\nless complicated action of the body with the co-operation of the mind,\r\nor of an action of the mind alone, for the purpose of being able to\r\nperform such actions better.\" From this point of view it will be seen\r\nthat exercise relates quite as much to the nervous system as to the\r\nmuscles. When, for example, a student takes a walk over ground with\r\nwhich he is familiar, and is at the same time so deeply engaged in\r\nthought as to be practically unconscious of what he is doing, only\r\nbeing recalled to himself, it may be, by arriving at his own door, the\r\nexercise which he has had is but partial and insufficient. Going to\r\nthe extreme, we can, as Du Bois Reymond remarks, conceive of a man\r\nwith muscles individually exercised until they were like those of the\r\nFarnese Hercules, and yet who would be unable to walk, much less\r\nexecute more complicated movements; for the proper co-operation of the\r\nmuscles, which is effected through the nervous system, is quite as\r\nnecessary as the force of their contraction.\r\n\r\nThe amount of exercise which is necessary for health varies with the\r\nindividual and with age, season, etc., so that it is difficult to\r\nstate any general rule upon this subject; but if stated in terms of\r\nmuscular force only, the estimate of Dr. Parkes seems a fair\r\napproximation--viz. that every healthy man ought to take daily an\r\namount of exercise equivalent to 150 tons lifted 1 foot, or a walk of\r\nabout nine miles. The majority of trades and bodily occupations demand\r\nat least this amount of work, but in some of them the greater part of\r\nthe exertion is made only by certain groups of muscles, and they are\r\ncarried on in crowded and {199} ill-ventilated shops. Such workmen, as\r\nwell as all who are engaged in sedentary pursuits, require exercise in\r\nthe open air--exercise which will bring into play the unused muscles\r\nand will break the train of thought of the professional man.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important questions with regard to physical exercise\r\nis the extent to, and manner in, which it should be provided for in a\r\nproper system of education. One of the latest and most instructive\r\narticles on this subject is that by Du Bois Reymond in the \"Physiology\r\nof Exercise,\" a translation of which is given in the _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_ for July and August, 1882. He divides the physical training\r\nwhich is more and more becoming a part of modern systematic education\r\ninto three classes: The first, the turning, or gymnastics of the\r\nGermans; the second, the Swedish system, in which the exercises are\r\nlimited to very simple though varied movements; and the English\r\nsystem, or rather want of system, consisting largely of athletic games\r\nand contests of various kinds. His objection to the Swedish system is\r\nthat, while it strengthens the muscles, it does not increase the power\r\nover composite movements; in other words, it does not exercise the\r\nnervous system. Naturally, he prefers the German system to any other,\r\nalthough admitting that the English meets better the demands arising\r\nfrom our structure. \"Were the end masterhood in running, jumping,\r\nclimbing, in dancing, fencing, riding, in swimming, rowing, or\r\nskating, then nothing could be more advisable than to practise equally\r\nthe necessary concatenations in the actions of the ganglion cells,\r\nwithout pausing at the not practically applicable preliminary and\r\nintermediate steps of the German turning.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a sanitary point of view, the gymnasium, as usually located and\r\nmanaged, is by no means equivalent to out-of-door sports and contests,\r\nalthough it is often the best substitute for them. The form of\r\nexercise most used by men whose occupation does not involve bodily\r\nlabor is walking, and next to this riding. Whatever mode be selected,\r\nit is very desirable that it should be taken for some other object\r\nthan that of the mere making muscular exertion, or otherwise it will\r\nsoon come to be looked upon as an unpleasant task, the time spent upon\r\nwhich is given grudgingly; and it will be partially or wholly\r\nabandoned as soon as the immediate discomfort which induced its use\r\nhas ceased.\r\n\r\nIt is not an uncommon error among men engaged in mental work to\r\nsuppose that they can, and ought to, take the same amount of exercise\r\nwhich gives good results in those whose occupations involve physical\r\nrather than mental effort, or to think that the more exercise they\r\ntake the more study or writing they are equal to. This is a grave\r\nmistake. Expenditure of brain-tissue is not to be repaired by muscular\r\nexertion, but by sleep and food, and exercise in the fresh air\r\nsufficient to produce appetite and sufficient weariness to ensure\r\nrestful sleep is all that is necessary. For a time it is true that the\r\nstudent or writer who has a well-developed body can continue to burn\r\nthe candle at both ends, and win literary honors while also standing\r\nhigh as an athlete; but this surely leads to physiological bankruptcy\r\nin the end.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that good muscular development is not\r\nnecessarily synonymous with health, and that strength is not a\r\nguarantee against disease. And, while it is true that in this, as in\r\nmost other matters of individual hygiene, each man must to a great\r\nextent be a law to {200} himself, and learn by experience what kind of\r\nexercise and how much of it he requires, yet the physician can often\r\nsupply the motive which was wanting, or check undue effort. Exercise\r\nfor the sake of health and comfort is not an end, but a means; yet if\r\nthis means can be made to secure to the patient an end agreeable and\r\npleasant in itself, so much the better.\r\n\r\nXI. CONTAGION AND DISINFECTION.--By \"contagion\" we mean the\r\ncommunication of disease from one person to another, either by direct\r\ncontact or through some medium, such as air, water, etc. It therefore\r\nincludes \"infection,\" which is now generally used as a synonym for it.\r\nThe so-called infective diseases of modern German writers\r\n(Infections-Krankheiten) include, besides what are commonly termed in\r\nEnglish, contagious diseases, the so-called miasmatic diseases.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of a contagious disease is its specificity; that\r\nis, the disease transmitted is always the same in its essential\r\ncharacteristics. It does not, however, follow that all cases of the\r\ndisease are equally liable or have the same power to transmit it; in\r\nother words, the degree of virulence of the contagiousness is not an\r\nessential characteristic. That the same disease sometimes spreads\r\nrapidly and is very fatal, and at other times seems hardly to have any\r\ncontagious properties and is very mild, has long been noticed, and has\r\nbeen attributed to an unknown something called the medical\r\nconstitution of the place--the constitution médicale of French\r\nwriters. The true cause is probably very complex, but in some cases,\r\nat all events, it seems to be due to difference in the contagion\r\nitself. If we suppose this contagion to be a minute organism, it is\r\neasy to form a theory as to the cause of these differences, but there\r\nis much careful experimental work to be done before we shall have\r\npositive knowledge on this point. The results obtained by Pasteur in\r\nattenuating the virus of chicken cholera and splenic fever indicate\r\none line which these experiments will take, and the researches of Koch\r\npoint out another.\r\n\r\nThe diseases which spread by contagion until they form epidemics are\r\nthose which have from the earliest times attracted the most general\r\nattention, and which have given rise to organized efforts for\r\nprevention--_i.e._ to public hygiene.\r\n\r\nThey are also the diseases which have given rise to the most bitter\r\ncontroversies among medical men as to the means of their propagation\r\nand the best methods of prevention. Plague, cholera, yellow fever, and\r\ntyphus are those with regard to which this difference of opinion has\r\nchiefly occurred--one party considering their chief cause to be\r\ncontagion, or specific germs derived directly or indirectly from the\r\nbodies of the sick; the second party declaring that they are due to\r\nfilth plus an unknown something, which is variously termed epidemic\r\nconstitution, pandemic wave, Providence, or _x_. The great majority of\r\nopinions at present is in favor of the view that they are all\r\ncontagious, but not all, or always, contagious from person to\r\nperson--that they spread from infected localities, which localities\r\nreceive their infection from cases of the disease. The best means of\r\ndealing with them under ordinary circumstances are now tolerably well\r\nunderstood, and where these means can be commanded--as, for instance,\r\namong troops in time of peace--epidemics of these diseases can be\r\nstopped with great precision and promptness by isolation and\r\ndisinfection.\r\n\r\n{201} By \"isolation\" is meant not only the separation of the sick from\r\nthe well, but the isolation of the infected locality or water-supply\r\nuntil it has been rendered harmless.\r\n\r\nBy \"disinfection\" is meant the destruction of the specific causes of\r\ndisease, and more especially of the infectious or spreading diseases.\r\nA disinfectant is not necessarily an antiseptic or a deodorant, nor\r\nare these last necessarily disinfectants. The best practical\r\nantiseptic for sanitary purposes is cleanliness; the best\r\ndisinfectants are heat, bichloride of mercury, sulphate of iron,\r\nchloride of zinc, sulphurous acid, chlorine, sunlight, and pure air,\r\nand, for yellow fever, cold. With our present very imperfect knowledge\r\nof the nature of specific causes of disease which we wish to destroy,\r\nwe have no means of determining the presence of these causes in or on\r\nan article of clothing or of furniture, or in a room or other\r\nlocality, except by the production of their specific effects on man or\r\nby inductive reasoning; in other words, we can only say that it is\r\nmore or less probable that such causes are present. This makes it\r\nnecessary, or at least expedient, to employ disinfectants in many\r\ncases where the presence of such causes is doubtful. The practical\r\ndifficulties are, first, to bring the disinfecting agent into such\r\nrelation with the causes of disease that it can act upon them, and act\r\nupon all of them; second, to avoid unnecessary destruction or injury\r\nof things which should be preserved. The majority of the causes of\r\ndisease upon which we wish to act by disinfectants are probably minute\r\nparticles of solid or semi-solid matter which are living, and may be\r\nconveniently designated by the word \"_germs_.\" In the presence of\r\nmoisture the destruction of the vitality of these germs can be\r\neffected with comparative ease and rapidity, but when they have become\r\ndried, or, as in the case of the bacilli, are in the form of spores,\r\nit is a more difficult matter.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the methods to be pursued and the precautions to be\r\ntaken, let us suppose the physician to be called on for directions as\r\nto the management of a case of scarlatina, the object being to prevent\r\nits spread. The first thing to be done is to get the patient in a room\r\nby himself, and to leave nothing in this room which is not necessary.\r\nRemove the carpet, curtains, and all stuffed or upholstered furniture.\r\nLet the nursing be done, as far as possible, by one person only, and\r\ndo not allow others, and especially children, to enter the room, no\r\nmatter if they have had the disease. The danger of contagion depends\r\nupon particles coming from the skin and mucous membranes. All excreta,\r\nand more especially the sputa or discharges from the mouth or nose,\r\nare to be treated as dangerous. The excreta should be received in\r\nvessels containing a solution of sulphate of iron, one and a half\r\npounds to the gallon. All clothing, towels, bed-linen, handkerchiefs,\r\nnapkins, etc. should be placed in a solution composed of four ounces\r\nof sulphate of zinc and two ounces of common salt to the gallon of\r\nwater as soon as they are not needed for further use. Especial care\r\nshould be taken that none of these articles are removed from the room\r\nwhile dry, and while they are in the room, and before they have been\r\nmoistened, they should not be shaken or disturbed more than is\r\nabsolutely necessary. If for any reason the zinc solution above\r\nreferred to is not at hand--which should very rarely be the case--the\r\nclothing, etc. should be placed in a bucket, tub, or boiler containing\r\nenough scalding water to entirely cover them, and be removed {202}\r\nfrom the room in this vessel. All such articles should be boiled at\r\nleast one hour.\r\n\r\nNo sweeping or dusting in the ordinary way is to be done in the room;\r\ndust and dirt are to be removed by damp cloths, which are to be\r\ntreated like the bedding and clothing. The great object is to prevent\r\nas far as possible the production of dust in the atmosphere of the\r\nroom. The entire body of the patient, including head, face, and limbs,\r\nshould be kept thoroughly anointed with camphorated oil, vaseline, or\r\nsome similar substance, and especial care should be taken in this\r\nrespect during the period of convalescence so long as any roughness or\r\ndesquamation of the skin continues. No toys or books which it is\r\ndesired to preserve should be allowed to remain in the room, and under\r\nno circumstances should books or toys be borrowed to amuse the child\r\nif they are to be returned. The best way to disinfect such articles is\r\nto burn them in the room.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient is fully convalescent and all desquamation has\r\nceased, cleanse him thoroughly with a warm bath and soap for four\r\nsuccessive days. If at the end of that time no roughness of the skin\r\nremains, he may be dressed in clean clothes and taken from the room,\r\nfor he is no longer a source of danger. The room itself and the\r\nfurniture are then to be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. The\r\nceiling and walls, if of ordinary hard finish, are to be scraped and\r\nwhitewashed. All woodwork should be rubbed with damp cloths and the\r\nfloor well scrubbed. Care should be taken to remove all dust from the\r\nledges over windows and doors. All the cloths used in this cleansing\r\nprocess are to be burned.\r\n\r\nIf these directions have been carefully carried out, there is no need\r\nfor further disinfection. But if upholstered furniture has been\r\nallowed to remain in the room, or other articles which cannot be\r\nburned or scrubbed or soaked in the zinc solution, it may be desirable\r\nto attempt to disinfect the whole room and its contents by means of\r\nchlorine or sulphurous acid gases. Of these, sulphurous acid gas is\r\nthe cheapest, and upon the whole the best, but it must be used in\r\nlarge quantity, and for a longer time than is customary, if it is to\r\nbe relied upon. For this purpose all openings into the room should be\r\nclosed, and pillows, mattrasses, upholstered furniture, and articles\r\nwhich cannot be treated with the zinc solution should be opened, so\r\nthat they may be exposed throughout to the fumes. The sulphur should\r\nbe burned in an iron pan or pot, placed in a tub containing water or\r\nupon a large surface of sand. About 18 ounces of roll sulphur should\r\nbe used to each 1000 cubic feet of space, and after twenty-four hours\r\n12 ounces more should be burned and the room be then closed for\r\ntwenty-four hours longer, after which it may be opened and aired. In\r\ncase of death the body should at once be wrapped in a sheet thoroughly\r\nsoaked with the chloride of zinc solution, and either be placed in an\r\nair-tight coffin at once or be buried without delay. The funeral\r\nshould be strictly private, and the sheet referred to should not be\r\ndisturbed or the body exposed to view.\r\n\r\nThe cases most liable to spread the disease are those in which the\r\nattack is very light and the child is not confined to its bed. It is\r\ndesirable that children in a house in which there are cases of scarlet\r\nfever should not be allowed to attend school or mingle with other\r\nchildren who have not had the disease.\r\n\r\nWith regard to disinfectants, it may be well to note that none of the\r\n{203} various patent disinfectants are superior to bichloride of\r\nmercury, chloride of zinc, sulphate of iron, chlorine, and sulphurous\r\nacid; very few are equal to them, and none cost so little. As a\r\ngaseous disinfectant for rooms, etc. chlorine is superior to\r\nsulphurous acid, but it has the disadvantage of injuring metals, is\r\nnot so easily applied, and is more costly. It will destroy the\r\nvitality of the spores of the bacilli more rapidly and certainly than\r\nsulphurous acid, which last, to make sure work, must be exhibited for\r\na much longer period than is customary. I should not feel confident as\r\nto the thorough disinfection by sulphurous acid of the hold of an\r\ninfected ship unless the fumes had been applied for sixty hours.\r\nCarbolic acid as ordinarily used is an antiseptic rather than a\r\ndisinfectant. Its vapor in a sick room is absolutely useless. When\r\napplied in strong solution it is effective, for a time at least, but\r\nas thus used it is expensive, its odor is unpleasant to many, and\r\nmasks the odors from putrefying substances and excreta, etc., thus\r\npreventing the warning which these odors would give. Its use is in\r\nmany cases very much like removing the rattle from the rattlesnake.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions made above for limiting the spread of scarlatina from\r\na case to be treated in the residence of the patient apply--with\r\ncertain modifications for each form of disease, which will readily\r\nsuggest themselves to the physician--to all the affections due to\r\nportable contagia.\r\n\r\nAmong the poorer classes, however, it will often be found impossible\r\nto obtain the separate room and service and the constant intelligent\r\ncare which are necessary to ensure the desired result; and in such a\r\ncase the patient should be removed to a hospital, for his own sake as\r\nwell as for that of the community. The utility of small hospitals for\r\ninfectious diseases is by no means generally understood, and very few\r\nof our small cities and towns are provided with anything of the sort.\r\nIf the subject is urged on the authorities of a place, the reply will\r\nbe that it is an unnecessary expense, that the people would not go to\r\nit, and that such an institution is in itself a source of danger. The\r\nfacts are, that such a hospital costs very little, and is the cheapest\r\ninsurance against epidemics which a town can have; if it is kept clean\r\nand comfortable, the people will use it freely, and if properly\r\nmanaged it does not offer the slightest danger to the vicinity. This\r\nquestion will be further discussed in the last section of this paper.\r\n\r\nThe principles of isolation as applied to a single case as indicated\r\nabove may also be applied to infected localities in case of epidemics.\r\nWhen taken in time, all diseases which depend upon particulate\r\ncontagia for their origin can be stamped out by isolation and\r\ndisinfection. Unfortunately, to effect this promptly and successfully\r\nrequires money, labor, and the co-operation of the well in the\r\nvicinity; which last it is usually impossible to obtain voluntarily or\r\nto compel sufficiently to secure the desired results. A question which\r\nsometimes arises in case of epidemics, and with regard to the\r\nnecessity for which physicians will be consulted, relates to the\r\nclosure of the public schools. It is certain that the assemblage of\r\nchildren in schools exerts a powerful influence on the spread of such\r\ndiseases as scarlet fever, diphtheria, and whooping cough. On the\r\nother hand, the closure of the schools infringes upon the rights of a\r\nlarge number of the community, and if long continued, as it sometimes\r\nmust be to be really efficacious, inflicts upon them {204} a permanent\r\nloss. It is, moreover, a confession on the part of the authorities of\r\ninability to induce or compel what must always be a comparatively\r\nsmall part of the community to take the proper precautions. It is\r\nnever justifiable to close schools on account of small-pox, and where\r\nthere is a competent health authority supported by the influence of\r\nthe medical profession, it must be a very exceptional set of\r\ncircumstances which justifies their closure for diphtheria or\r\nscarlatina.\r\n\r\nIt is not deemed expedient here to discuss the vexed question of\r\nquarantine. It is more important against yellow fever than any other\r\ndisease, because every day of delay of the entrance of the disease\r\nwhich it secures lessens largely the subsequent mortality, since the\r\nduration of the disease is limited by frost. This is not the case with\r\ncholera, and the mere keeping this disease out of a place for a few\r\nweeks does not diminish its ravages when it has once gained an\r\nentrance. To rely altogether on quarantine, either maritime or inland,\r\nto keep yellow fever, cholera, or any other disease out of this\r\ncountry is a far greater mistake than to neglect it altogether. The\r\npractical way to isolate and quarantine is to get as close to the\r\naffected spot as possible. Precautions at Havana for yellow fever, or\r\nat Hamburg for cholera, are far more useful to the United States than\r\nthe same amount of work at our own ports can possibly be; really good\r\nwork in this direction must be not only national, but international.\r\n\r\nXII. MENTAL CAUSES OF DISEASE.--A man may give too much attention to\r\nhis health and the means for its preservation, and the doing so is\r\nboth a sign and a cause of disease--probably oftener the former than\r\nthe latter, except in cases of psychological epidemics. The power of\r\nexpectant attention, especially if accompanied by belief or fear, to\r\nproduce derangement of function in the nervous system, and through\r\nthis to affect the circulatory and digestive systems, is well known to\r\nmedical men. The effects of an undue amount of brain-work, and\r\nespecially of the anxiety and worry which often accompany this when it\r\nis specially directed to the acquiring of wealth, fame, or power, are\r\nalso familiar to physicians in our large cities. The analogies between\r\nmental and physical exertion are close in some respects, and\r\nespecially as to the effects of over-exertion in a limited time under\r\nthe influence of excitement.\r\n\r\nThe danger from simple mental work, such as study, when there is no\r\nexcitement from a contest, is small, and depends mainly on lack of\r\nphysical exercise and consequent disorder of the digestive organs. The\r\nrisk of producing what Fothergill calls \"physiological bankruptcy\" is\r\ngreatest in the youth studying for a prize, the speculator, the man\r\nwho feels responsibility which he knows he probably cannot meet. The\r\ndanger of injury from overwork under excitement is a very real one in\r\nmany of our schools, and, while the evil results are most apparent in\r\ngirls of the middle and upper classes, the boys and the young men also\r\nsuffer. The system of pass examinations, in which the standing of the\r\npupil is to be determined, not from the average results of his daily\r\nrecitations, but from a single examination at the end of the year,\r\nproduces the greatest risks to health; and this is especially the case\r\nwhere the ambition and pride of the children are stimulated by\r\ncompetition for prizes, medals, etc. Such systems of grading by a\r\nsingle final examination should not be used in ordinary schools, and\r\nfor some pupils there will always be a risk to health connected with\r\nthem even when they are of age. No doubt the stimulus of {205}\r\ncompetition is useful with the majority of children as well as of\r\nadults, but with some of them it is pretty sure to go too far.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms produced by undue mental strain are familiar to all\r\nphysicians, and there is usually little difficulty in tracing the\r\neffect to the cause when attention has been directed to the matter; in\r\nfact, the patient himself usually knows very well the cause of his\r\ntroubles. The remedy is, of course, rest--but that does not mean\r\nidleness. In speaking of occupation, allusion has been made to the\r\nfact that the physician must at times advise his patient as to the\r\nadoption of some pursuit, and in cases of this kind such advice is\r\nalso useful.\r\n\r\nThe effects of mental strain are often mingled with, and aggravated\r\nby, those of stimulants which have been used to spur the flagging\r\nenergies. Alcohol, tobacco, opium, or coffee used in this way finally\r\nincrease the very discomforts which at first they relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Personal Hygiene in its Relations to the Practice of Medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding section have been indicated briefly some of the\r\nprincipal causes of disease and the methods for their investigation or\r\nremoval. We have now to consider some of the practical applications\r\nwhich may be made of the laws of etiology and prevention of disease in\r\nthe treatment of the sick. While the removal of the cause of illness\r\nby no means always effects a cure, yet the importance of a knowledge\r\nof this cause as an aid to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics is\r\nso evident as to require no proof.\r\n\r\nTo discuss with anything like completeness the practical applications\r\nof what would be commonly considered as hygienic rules in the\r\ntreatment of disease would be to write a treatise on nursing, and\r\nwould also include a large part of the practice of medicine, for\r\nregimen is the more important half of practical therapeutics. The\r\nhygienic requirements peculiar to each disease will be pointed out by\r\nthe writers upon special subjects, and I shall only venture upon one\r\nor two general remarks in addition to the hints already given in\r\nspeaking of the several causes.\r\n\r\nIn the acute stages of disease the sensations--or, if the term be\r\npreferred, the instincts--of the patient are usually the best guide to\r\nhis regimen so far as they go. In most cases he desires quiet, shade,\r\nbut not absolute darkness, and little or no food, although there is\r\noften a craving for drinks, especially of a cooling character. In the\r\nspecific fevers which have a tolerably definite period and course it\r\nis important to keep up the nourishment even during the period of\r\nanorexia, in order to provide against the debility which is to follow.\r\nThis nourishment is best given in the form of drink, and very\r\nfrequently fresh milk is the type of what is required. The old notion\r\nthat whatever a sick man desired must be hurtful, and therefore that\r\nthe fever patient must be kept hot and refused cool water, has now\r\nalmost entirely passed away.\r\n\r\nIn convalescence from acute disease and in many chronic cases, the\r\nsensations of the patient are not to be trusted as a guide in the\r\nchoice of food. In such diseases as yellow fever and typhoid fever to\r\nallow the convalescent to follow the dictates of his appetite is to\r\nrun great risk of a fatal result. In other cases the patient really\r\nhas no wish in the matter, but it {206} will often be found that one\r\nwho can think of nothing which he desires to eat, and who will even\r\nrefuse a dish which he has requested and been thinking about, will eat\r\nwith enjoyment some unexpected dainty when presented at the right\r\nmoment and properly served as a skilled nurse knows how to do. The\r\nmanner of serving the food, independent of its cooking, is not a\r\nmatter of such small importance that the physician can afford to\r\noverlook it, and he will succeed best as a practitioner who best\r\nappreciates the influence which cracked goblet, a chipped saucer, a\r\nsoiled napkin, or, on the other hand, a hot plate or a touch of color\r\nin the shape of a leaf or flower, may have upon the capricious\r\nappetite of the sick. In ordering diet for convalescence it is not an\r\nuncommon error to select only those articles which are agreeable to\r\nthe physician himself, forgetting the old proverb, that what is one\r\nman's meat may be another man's poison, and also that it is above all\r\nthings desirable to avoid monotony. One doctor always orders chicken,\r\nanother eggs, a third a mutton-chop, etc. The practice in this respect\r\nhas probably been unduly influenced by the reports of Beaumont of the\r\nresults of his observations on Alexis St. Martin, and we still find\r\nthat the relative digestibility of various articles of food is\r\nestimated according to the scale laid down in these reports, with no\r\nallowance for individual peculiarities, previous habits, mode of\r\ncooking, etc. The secret of success in the diet of convalescence lies\r\nmainly in the simplicity of the individual dishes, in varying the\r\ndifferent meals, in the manner of serving, and in carefully observing\r\nthe effects on the sick person, and being guided by the results.\r\n\r\nTo promote appetite and digestion, and to secure refreshing sleep, one\r\nof the most important things is fresh air, but in many houses a sick\r\nperson will obtain but a very limited allowance of this if the\r\nphysician does not give special attention to the matter. Except in\r\ncases of contagious disease, the rules for managing which have been\r\ngiven in a previous section (p. 201), as soon as a patient is\r\nsufficiently recovered to be moved for a short time into another room\r\nhis bedroom should be thoroughly aired and cleansed, and this should\r\nbe done morning and evening thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn treating cases of contagious disease the question often arises as\r\nto means of individual prophylaxis to be used by those who must be\r\nexposed to the effects of the infected locality or of the presence of\r\nthe sick. The attempts which have been made to secure this individual\r\nprotection in the midst of an epidemic have been numerous and varied,\r\nranging from the use of the \"vinegar of the four thieves\" of the\r\nMiddle Ages to the employment of the sulphites and chlorates to make\r\nthe blood unsuited to the growth and multiplication of the supposed\r\ngerms, or of cotton-wool respirators to strain the infected air, or of\r\nsupposed specifics for particular diseases, as belladonna for scarlet\r\nfever and vaccination against small-pox. As yet, there is little or no\r\nsatisfactory evidence as to the value of individual precautions\r\nagainst those diseases whose contagion is conveyed through the air,\r\nsmall-pox alone excepted, but in case of diphtheria in one member of a\r\nfamily of children it might be well to try the use of chlorate of\r\npotash internally, combined with the local application of the tincture\r\nof the chloride of iron, as suggested by E. M. Hunt. The question is\r\none to be investigated by careful observation and experiment; and,\r\nthough it is improbable that any definite results will be obtained\r\nexcept in those diseases which are communicable to animals, and\r\ntherefore {207} susceptible of direct experiment, still, it is\r\npossible that some advance may be made. In rare and exceptional\r\ncases--as, for instance, in exploring a crowded, filthy, and intensely\r\ninfected typhus-fever nest, as a tenement-house, or an infected\r\nyellow-fever ship--it may be worth while for the physician or\r\ninspector who is unprotected by a previous attack of these diseases to\r\nmake use of a cotton-wool respirator, which is readily extemporized,\r\nand belongs to that exceedingly valuable and popular class of remedies\r\nwhich, \"if they do no good, can do no harm.\" In epidemics of typhus,\r\ncholera, or yellow fever one of the most valuable prophylactics is to\r\nhave a mind so occupied with other matters that it pays little or no\r\nattention to the danger, while in case of small-pox fear of the\r\ndisease is indirectly the best prophylactic, since it leads to careful\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nThis branch of the subject is closed with the remark that it would be\r\nwell if physicians, and especially the younger ones, gave more\r\nattention to the preservation of their own health than many of them\r\ndo. The possession of a medical diploma does not prevent the evil\r\neffects of irregular and hurried meals, insufficient sleep, exposure\r\nto inclement weather, and lack of systematic and sufficient exercise;\r\nand too much tobacco, sometimes too much alcohol, and in exceptional\r\ncases too much study and literary work, so often combine with anxiety\r\nabout individual patients or with pecuniary worries to damage the\r\ndigestion and nervous system of the young practitioner that the wonder\r\nis that so many survive the ordeal. And, in fact, the mortality among\r\nphysicians under the age of thirty is higher than that of any other\r\nprofession during the same period of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Public Hygiene in its Relations to Physicians.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between man and animals is found in the extent\r\nto which he will sacrifice a present pleasure or convenience to secure\r\na future good or to avoid a future evil. The savage will do this to\r\nonly a very limited extent--little more, in fact, than the beaver or\r\nthe squirrel--and the lesson is learned but slowly and by sad\r\nexperience. This is especially the case as regards matters affecting\r\nhealth. When a man begins to take special precautions as to his diet\r\nor exercise, having in view rather his future health than his present\r\ncomfort and tastes, he has in most cases already begun to suffer from\r\nthe effects of his imprudence, and does not commence a hygienic course\r\nof life as a perfectly sound and healthy person. The same is true for\r\na community. It will not usually submit to the burden of taxation\r\nnecessary to secure drains and sewers or a proper registration of\r\nvital statistics, nor to the cost and inconvenience of the machinery\r\nnecessary to limit the spread of contagious diseases, until the\r\nneglect of these things has resulted in such an amount of disease and\r\ndeath as to forcibly call attention to the matter. The result is, that\r\nthe burden is far heavier than it would have been had the work been\r\nundertaken in proper season, and individuals may find it to their\r\ninterest to leave the place and settle elsewhere rather than remain\r\nand meet their proportion of the expense.\r\n\r\nWhen a state or municipality has so far advanced in civilization as to\r\nconsider it desirable to take measures to protect the public health by\r\npreventing individuals from polluting the air or water liable to be\r\nused by {208} their neighbors, etc., the services of the medical\r\nprofession are always called upon. The foundation of public hygiene is\r\ninformation as to the occurrence of certain forms of disease, the\r\ncause of which can be referred with more or less precision to a\r\ncertain limited locality. This information may be very imperfect,\r\nconsisting of little more than rumor and opinions as to the existence\r\nof an undue amount of sickness or mortality in a certain place, or it\r\nmay consist of precise reports setting forth the number of deaths from\r\neach cause, the proportion of each of these to the population by age,\r\nsex, occupation, etc., and of the whole to births--constituting what\r\nis commonly called the \"vital statistics of a place\"--and also of\r\nreports of the occurrence of certain preventable diseases; and between\r\nthese two the information may be of various degrees of completeness,\r\nbut, whatever there be, it is for the most part obtained either\r\ndirectly or indirectly from medical men. The reliability and\r\ncompleteness of the information thus obtained by the state determines\r\nto a great extent the direction and character of the work done in\r\ndestroying or preventing the causes of disease, and it is also an\r\nimportant means of increasing our knowledge with regard to the nature\r\nof these causes.\r\n\r\nThe character of this information depends largely upon the character\r\nof the physicians who furnish it. In a large part of the country\r\nmedicine is legally in the position of any common occupation; that is,\r\nthe term \"physician\" is defined as applied to \"any one who publicly\r\nannounces himself to be a practitioner of this art, and undertakes to\r\ntreat the sick either for or without reward.\" Under such circumstances\r\nthere can be no guarantee that all who call themselves physicians are\r\nproperly qualified or competent to furnish reliable information for\r\nregistration purposes, and, as a matter of fact, a large number are\r\nnot so qualified. It is for this reason that there is such a close\r\nconnection between public health authorities, registration of vital\r\nstatistics, and the registration of those physicians whose\r\ncertificates as to causes of deaths, etc. will be accepted by the\r\nstate; and hence the nature of the public health organization of a\r\nstate and the personnel of its officials are matters of great\r\nimportance to physicians. On the other hand, the efficiency of a\r\npublic health service depends very largely upon the relations which it\r\nholds with, and the light in which it is regarded by, the medical\r\nprofession. A health officer who is distrusted and disliked by the\r\nphysicians of his district cannot effect much unless he can overcome\r\nthis feeling, and his tenure of office must always be very insecure.\r\n\r\nThe official relations of the practitioner with the health authorities\r\nare usually confined to the subjects of registration of vital\r\nstatistics and of checking the spread of contagious diseases. The most\r\nmarked exception to this rule is furnished by the States of Alabama\r\nand North and South Carolina, in which the State Medical Society is\r\nthe State Board of Health, having been given legislative powers and\r\nthe right of selecting the health officers. The most complete\r\norganization of this kind is that of the State of Alabama, where by\r\nthe act of 1875 the Medical Association of the State was constituted\r\nthe State Board of Health, and the county medical societies in\r\naffiliation with the State Society were made county boards of health,\r\nto be under the general direction of the State Board. These county\r\nboards at first had advisory powers only, and were to be conducted\r\nwithout expense to the State or the county, except that the competent\r\nlegal {209} authorities of any county might invest the county board\r\nwith such powers and duties for the promotion of the public health as\r\nmight be mutually agreed on; but in such case the right to elect or\r\nappoint those employed in sanitary administration is reserved to the\r\nboard of health, while all questions relating to salaries,\r\nappropriations, and expenditures shall be reserved to the legal\r\nauthorities. It was further provided \"that no board of health, or\r\nadvisory or executive medical body of any name or kind for the\r\nexercise of public health functions, shall be established by authority\r\nof law in any county-town or city of this State except such as are\r\ncontemplated by the provisions of this act, the object of this\r\nprohibition being to secure a uniform system of sanitary supervision\r\nthroughout the State.\" By an act of 1881 the county board is directed\r\nto elect a health officer, who is to keep a register of the births,\r\ndeaths, and cases of pestilential or infectious diseases occurring in\r\nthe county, and furnish to physicians, free of charge, reliable\r\nvaccine--to obtain information as to the sanitary condition of his\r\ncounty, etc. etc. It will be seen that this plan of organization is an\r\nattempt to overcome the practical difficulties in the way of obtaining\r\nfrom physicians the information necessary for the registration of\r\nvital statistics and the work of preventing the spread of infectious\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nWhile the great majority of physicians are willing to furnish the\r\ninformation as to the cause of death, etc. which is necessary for a\r\nuseful registration, there are always some who either neglect or\r\nrefuse to do so; and if the law be made compulsory, it provokes\r\nhostility unless compensation is furnished, while as regards the\r\nrequiring physicians to furnish information as to the existence of\r\ncontagious diseases, this always rouses opposition on the part of a\r\ncertain number of medical men, even if payment for such notification\r\nis provided. And while this opposition is no doubt in many cases due\r\nto improper motives, such as personal hostility to the existing\r\nauthorities, party politics, or a desire for notoriety, its strength\r\nnevertheless rests upon the fact that it is unjust for the state to\r\ncompel the services of any man or class of men without furnishing\r\ncompensation. The advocates of health and registration laws are thus\r\nplaced between Scylla and Charybdis: if they propose compensation,\r\nwhich involves appropriations from the public treasury, the law cannot\r\nbe passed; if there is no compensation allowed, complete results\r\ncannot be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Alabama law makes compulsory the furnishing by physicians of\r\ninformation relating to births, deaths, and infectious diseases, and\r\ngives compensation--not in money, but by allowing the medical\r\nprofession to have the sole management of the matter and to choose the\r\nhealth officers to whom they are to report; in other words, they are\r\nallowed to tax themselves. The result in Alabama is yet doubtful. If\r\ncompetent and faithful health officers and registrars can be obtained\r\nwithout paying them a fair compensation, it will be contrary to\r\nexperience; and if these officers receive a salary, it will be strange\r\nif the positions do not become the reward of partisan political work.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the requiring a physician to report the births\r\noccurring in his practice stands on a very different basis from the\r\nrequiring him to report the cause of death, since there is no special\r\nnecessity for the former. It requires no expert knowledge to report a\r\nbirth, and the duty should obviously devolve on the householder.\r\n\r\n{210} In those States in which by law only properly qualified medical\r\nmen, as determined by examination, have the right to practice, to hold\r\nmedical office, or to furnish medical certificates, the State\r\ncertainly is entitled to require of all physicians thus registered and\r\nauthoritatively recommended to the people as competent, that they\r\nshall furnish, free of charge, certificates of the cause of death in\r\nthose cases where they are cognizant of such cause.\r\n\r\nStates and municipalities often demand much more than this; as, for\r\ninstance, that the medical man shall fill out the whole certificate,\r\nincluding age, nativity, nativity of parents, etc., and that he shall\r\nfurnish the information to the registrar. In some cases it is provided\r\nthat any physician having attended a person during his last illness\r\nshall furnish the certificate: this would apply to cases where the\r\nphysician may not have seen the case for weeks before death.\r\n\r\nWhile it is most convenient to have the certificate of cause of death\r\nupon the same form which contains the data necessary to identify the\r\nindividual, the certificate should be distinct from the latter, and\r\nthe duty of making the return to the registrar should devolve on the\r\nhouseholder or undertaker, and not on the physician. On the other\r\nhand, it is easy for the physician to be hypercritical in these\r\nmatters: his certificate is to be considered rather as a statement of\r\nopinion than as a statement of facts within his personal knowledge,\r\nprecisely as he would certify as to his own age and birthplace.\r\n\r\nThe compulsory notification of infectious diseases to the health\r\nauthorities is a matter presenting much greater difficulties than that\r\nof certificates as to causes of death. The state has no right to\r\nrequire such notification from the physician without giving some quid\r\npro quo, and it is not expedient to make it compulsory, even with\r\npayment, except from physicians employed by the state or municipality,\r\nto furnish gratuitous medical attendance to the poor. The state has\r\nthe right to require such information from the parent or householder,\r\nand it has also the right to require the physician to notify the\r\nparent or householder as soon as he recognizes the existence of such\r\ninfectious disease. It is extremely desirable that the health\r\nauthorities of a city should receive promptly, and direct from\r\nphysicians, notification of the occurrence of such diseases, and there\r\nwill usually be no difficulty in obtaining this if the health officer\r\nhas tact and discretion and the city is prepared to do its duty. This\r\nduty is not confined to registering the information or placarding the\r\nhouse, nor will it be properly performed by merely removing the sick\r\nperson to a hospital and disinfecting the premises. If the case occur\r\nin a family which can secure its proper isolation, and the attending\r\nphysician certifies that it is so isolated and makes himself\r\nresponsible for its management (for which responsibility he should be\r\npaid by the patient or his friends), the health officer should not\r\ninterfere nor do more than furnish a competent person to secure\r\ndisinfection if required. The employment of a trained nurse known by\r\nthe health authorities to be competent and reliable would do away with\r\nmost of the difficulties connected with such cases in the upper and\r\nmiddle classes of society; and such nurses should be registered just\r\nas physicians and midwives are.\r\n\r\nWhere the case cannot be thus isolated and properly cared for, it\r\nshould be removed to a proper hospital. This presupposes that the city\r\nhas such a hospital, and if it has not, and is not prepared for such\r\ncases, notification {211} is useless. When the city places a house in\r\nquarantine so as to interfere with business, it should be for the\r\nshortest possible time consistent with securing thorough disinfection\r\nof the premises, and the city should bear not only the cost of such\r\ndisinfection, but the cost of caring for the persons in the house in\r\nan isolated place until no further danger is to be apprehended for\r\nthem. When the city undertakes to pay all expenses for isolation and\r\ndisinfection of such cases, it has the right to require that all such\r\ncases shall be so treated, leaving it to private parties to meet the\r\ncost in case they prefer not to use the buildings and apparatus\r\nprovided by the city for that purpose. And when the city does its duty\r\nin this respect, it will be found that physicians and the people will\r\ndo theirs, with rare exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhen a city becomes very unhealthy the usual policy is to conceal the\r\nfact as much as possible, and to attribute the mortality to some other\r\nthan the real cause. The influence of the mercantile part of the\r\ncommunity is in such a case strongly exerted on the daily press and on\r\nthe health authorities to produce such representations of the\r\ncondition of things as will tend to allay apprehensions on the part of\r\ntheir customers. The healthfulness of a place is usually estimated\r\nfrom its mortality reports, but the reliability of these is by no\r\nmeans always what it should be. Yellow fever is called typho-malarial\r\nor pernicious fever, typhoid is reported as diarrhoea or malarial\r\nfever, etc. etc., and great stress is laid upon what is called the\r\nsanitary condition of the place, which is declared to be excellent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this phrase, \"sanitary condition,\" means different\r\nthings at different times. When the mortality is low, sanitary\r\ncondition means the healthfulness of a place; when it is high, it\r\nmeans the cleanliness of a place. To a certain extent physicians are\r\nresponsible for the truth of the statistical returns, not so much in\r\nrelation to the number as to the causes of deaths; but none save those\r\nwho have practised in a city liable to epidemics can realize the\r\nenormous pressure which is brought to bear on medical men to induce\r\nthem to aid in or wink at concealing the true state of the case. Of\r\ncourse, this ostrich-like policy is in the long run an exceedingly\r\nunwise one, but neither the average householder nor community can be\r\nexpected at present to pursue any other, except under pressure.\r\n\r\nThere are many questions as to the best form of public health\r\norganization, and the powers and duties which should be conferred upon\r\nit, which can only be properly answered by taking into consideration\r\nthe circumstances in each case. In a large city the health officers\r\nmust have great powers if they are to be really efficient. They have\r\nto contend with ignorance, custom, and self-interest, and their action\r\nmust in many cases be prompt and unrestricted if it is to be\r\nefficacious. They must sometimes be in conflict with wealthy and\r\npowerful corporations, whose interests are opposed to the reforms\r\nwhich they urge, and although their business is to protect the most\r\nimportant interest of the community at large--_i.e._ its\r\nhealth--against the interests of individuals, yet these last are much\r\nmore immediately concerned, and are, naturally, so active that they\r\nare often, although few in number, able to defeat any attempt to\r\ninterfere with their occupations.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that a health board may have all the power\r\n{212} necessary, so far as the laws are concerned, and yet may be able\r\nto accomplish little for want of funds to pay the inspectors and other\r\nofficials whose services are necessary. For a city, a health officer\r\nusually does better work than a board of health: his responsibility is\r\nmore direct, and he has stronger motives to do good work, than a\r\nboard. Of course, a poor health officer is less efficient than a good\r\nboard of health, but the general rule is as above stated. The problems\r\nof hygiene require special knowledge, and the man who is to deal with\r\nthem requires special training. The folly of treating diseases by\r\ntheir names with popular or patent remedies is not greater than that\r\nof the attempt to make a healthy house or city by men who are not\r\narchitects or engineers or physicians, or who have only the\r\ninformation possessed by the average architect or engineer or\r\nphysician. And, of all professional or educated men, the physician\r\nespecially should recognize his own ignorance. When he is asked what\r\none should take for dyspepsia or pneumonia his answer is, \"Take the\r\nadvice of a physician;\" and so when he is asked how the plumbing of a\r\nhouse should be arranged, how a hospital should be ventilated, how a\r\ncity should be sewered, how a marsh should be dealt with or a\r\nwater-supply provided, he should reply, \"Get expert advice and\r\nsupervision, and be prepared to pay the amount necessary to secure\r\nit.\" It is the special duty of the physician to exert his influence to\r\nsecure properly constituted sanitary authorities for his own locality,\r\nhis State, and for the nation, and to support these against the\r\nhostility which they must inevitably arouse if they are efficient. And\r\nhe should do this, not blindly and as a partisan, but intelligently\r\nand with due consideration of all the important interests involved.\r\n\r\nThe body of educated physicians in a community forms the tribunal by\r\nwhich the work of sanitary officials is to be judged, and they cannot\r\njudge wisely unless they appreciate the difficulties with which health\r\nofficials have to contend. If a city has an incompetent or dishonest\r\nboard of health, the medical profession of that city are to a certain\r\nextent responsible for it; if a competent, energetic, and faithful\r\nsanitary officer is crippled and harassed or forced out of office\r\nbecause he is on the wrong side of politics, or because in the\r\nlegitimate and proper exercise of his functions he has come in\r\nconflict with the interests of powerful and wealthy individuals or\r\ncorporations, it is the duty of medical men to support him, and to do\r\nthis actively and promptly. And I take great pleasure in being able to\r\nsay, as the result of somewhat extended observation, that, as a rule,\r\nthe physicians of this country do cheerfully and promptly co-operate\r\nwith the sanitary authorities where such exist, and are the first to\r\ntry to have them properly organized and given the necessary means and\r\npowers to do effective work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{213}\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE IN THEIR HYGIENIC RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nBY GEO. E. WARING, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor reasons, sometimes sound and sometimes fanciful, the drainage\r\nquestion often presents itself to the medical practitioner as an\r\nannoying if not as a serious one. It is not necessary for the\r\nphysician to make himself an adept in the art of sanitary drainage,\r\nbut he can properly meet neither the demands of nervous patients nor\r\nthe exigencies of sometimes serious situations without having an\r\nintelligent general idea concerning it. Not only to prescribe\r\nimprovement, but frequently to allay ill-grounded apprehension, he\r\nshould be able to address himself, intelligently and promptly, at\r\nleast to the few simple problems presented in connection with ordinary\r\nhouses. I use the expression \"ill-grounded apprehension,\" not because\r\nthe drainage in and about houses is generally tolerably good, for it\r\nis not, but because the race seems to have so inured itself to certain\r\ngrave defects in plumbing-work that one may reasonably hesitate, and\r\nlook elsewhere for the occasion of diseases before accusing the\r\nimperfect sanitary appliances of an average house.\r\n\r\nAnything like a treatise on the technical details of house-drainage\r\nwould be quite out of place here. There are note-books easily\r\naccessible to such physicians as care to make a thorough study of the\r\nsubject. It does seem worth while, however, to pass in careful review,\r\nin a work of this character, the various conditions of interior and\r\nexterior drainage upon which a physician is frequently called to pass\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe perfect drainage of a house, like the perfect drainage of a town,\r\nimplies the immediate and complete removal, to a point well beyond its\r\nlimits, of all waste matters which are a proper subject of\r\nwater-carriage; such a thorough ventilation of the channel which these\r\nmatters have traversed as to reduce to a minimum the production of\r\ndeleterious gases arising from the decomposition of the film with\r\nwhich they may have soiled the walls of their conduit; and adequate\r\nprovision for the absolute and permanent exclusion from the atmosphere\r\nwithin the house of the air of the pipe or sewer. This is a brief and\r\nsimple statement of the fundamental and absolute requirements of all\r\ngood drainage. It is founded on the one grand object which governs all\r\nimprovement of this character: the prevention of decomposition of\r\nrefuse matters anywhere in house or town.\r\n\r\nPractically, it is safe to say that these conditions are never\r\ncomplete, and that instances of perfect work are so exceptional as to\r\nneed no {214} consideration here. We have to assume, substantially in\r\nevery case that is presented, that we are dealing with defective work,\r\nordinarily with work that is very seriously defective. Most houses\r\nhave been built by contractors, and the plumbing is perhaps the item\r\nof the whole structure that it is considered easiest and safest to\r\nscamp or to neglect. Even where the motive of economy has had no\r\ncontrolling influence, the drainage has almost invariably been planned\r\nby a plumber who has learned his trade and conceived his ideas in the\r\nperformance of work which was done at a time when no one realized the\r\nserious consequences of its being improperly done. The absence of\r\ninterior ventilation, leaky joints, ill-arranged connections between\r\nthe various plumbing appliances and the main outlet from the house,\r\npipes and traps so large that an ordinary current is powerless to keep\r\nthem clean, defects of form, defects of material, and defects of\r\nconstruction, are met with on every hand. This general statement is of\r\nitself sufficient to show how hopeless it is for the average physician\r\nto prescribe the manner in which the drainage of a house should be\r\nconstructed or remodelled.\r\n\r\nIf we view the question solely with reference to its bearing on the\r\ncausation of disease, we enter a field where neither the sanitarian\r\nnor the physician is ever sure of his footing. The precise relation\r\nbetween bad drainage and ill-health no man knows. Certain diseases are\r\nundoubtedly traceable to conditions of air or of drinking-water due to\r\nthe improper disposal of organic wastes, but the extent and exact\r\nbearing of these influences are still greatly a matter of conjecture.\r\nIt is, however, undoubtedly safe to assume--and the assumption is\r\nsupported by ample general observation, if not by precisely\r\nascertained facts--that whether we are considering serious diseases or\r\nthe slighter ailments, every argument leads to the enforcement of the\r\nmost strenuous requirements of cleanliness. Through all the ages no\r\none has disputed, and no one has improved upon, the simple sanitary\r\nformula, \"Pure air, pure water, and a pure soil.\" We may safely wait\r\nuntil the enthusiastic investigators now engaged with the subject\r\nshall have adduced the testimony of positive facts, if we will in the\r\nmean time adhere strictly to the requirements of Hippocrates'\r\nprescription. The physician will surely not go wrong if he treats all\r\nobvious defects of drainage as positive evils, and insists upon their\r\ncomplete reformation.\r\n\r\nNot to confine ourselves to houses which are provided with the\r\nordinary modern plumbing-works, but to include all collateral branches\r\nof the subject, we have to consider the following conditions:\r\n\r\n  I. THE REMOVAL OF HUMAN EXCREMENT:\r\n      (_a_) By water-carriage in houses provided with modern plumbing;\r\n      (_b_) By some form of dry conservancy;\r\n      (_c_) By the fiendish privy-vault which prevails so generally,\r\n              save in the larger cities.\r\n II. THE REMOVAL OF LIQUID HOUSEHOLD WASTES:\r\n      (_a_) By delivery to public sewers;\r\n      (_b_) By irrigation disposal;\r\n      (_c_) By delivery into cesspools.\r\n\r\nIncidentally to the above there must be considered the influences of\r\nthe ultimate disposal of all household waste, whether by the public\r\nsewer or the private house-drain.\r\n\r\n{215} I. THE REMOVAL OF HUMAN EXCREMENT.--We are too apt to judge of\r\nthe power for mischief of any waste matter by its original\r\noffensiveness, and the world at large regards the solid and liquid\r\nexuviæ of the human body as the most dangerous material with which it\r\nhas to deal. Doubtless it is so under certain exceptional\r\ncircumstances. If impregnated with the infective principle of cholera\r\nor of typhoid fever, for example, its influence for evil may be\r\nwidespread and active, but in the absence of such infection these\r\nsubstances offer a less serious problem, and, as their offensiveness\r\ncauses them to be more carefully avoided, their evil influence is\r\nless, and is less widely disseminated, than is that of the\r\ncomparatively inoffensive wastes of the kitchen-sink. This is a\r\nconsideration important to be borne in mind. Nothing is more common\r\nthan the expression of the opinion that the wastes of a population are\r\noffensive and dangerous in proportion to the degree to which\r\nexcrementitious matter is allowed to flow away with its general\r\ndrainage. The fact is, that the drainage from a house or from a town,\r\nif reasonably diluted with water, is very slightly offensive until it\r\nhas passed through a considerable degree of decomposition. The outflow\r\nof a perfectly sewered town, where the whole community uses\r\nwater-closets, is less offensive than the neglected back-yard drain of\r\nan average New England farm-house. The trouble begins with the\r\ncondition of putridity. Fecal matter and urine are somewhat quicker\r\nthan the other wastes of the house to enter into putrefaction, but the\r\ndifference is only one of degree, and the latter rapidly overtakes the\r\nformer in the foulness of its condition; so that where a house is\r\nprovided with two cesspools, one for water-closet matter and the other\r\nfor kitchen waste, it is quite impossible to determine from the\r\ncharacter of their contents which is which; therefore examinations of\r\nthe drainage of a house should by no means be confined to the manner\r\nin which its excrementitious matters are disposed of. Setting aside,\r\nin this connection, the peculiar liability of these matters to become\r\nthe seat of specific infections, it is fair to assume that equally\r\ncomplete and cleanly arrangements are needed for all else that flows\r\nto waste, as for the discharges of the water-closet. The purpose of\r\nthese remarks is of course not to belittle the importance of proper\r\ncare in the disposal of human excreta, but to prevent the giving of an\r\nundue importance to this branch of the subject, with too light\r\ntreatment of the very serious difficulties presented by the others.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Modern conveniences may fairly be said to be the bane of modern\r\nsociety, or at least of such of its members as have the questionable\r\ngood fortune to be housed within the same four walls with every device\r\nthat a misguided talent for invention has led the American mechanic to\r\nprovide for the comfort and convenience of the occupant. Properly\r\nregulated, there is no element of modern house-building more conducive\r\nto health than such a system of plumbing as brings within reasonable\r\nlimits the labor of supplying abundant water at every point in the\r\nhouse, and obviates the need for exposure and removes the temptation\r\nto neglect and postponement attending the use of out-of-door houses of\r\nconvenience. The spigot and the water-closet are the two essential\r\nsanitary agents which the plumber offers to us. The bath may be\r\nreplaced by the sponge, the stationary wash-basin may be, and\r\ngenerally should be, replaced by the bowl and pitcher of our fathers,\r\nbut there is no sufficient {216} substitute for an ample supply of\r\nwater on each floor of the house and for a cleanly water-closet placed\r\nwithin doors. The evil that the plumber has inflicted upon the race is\r\ndue very largely to his not having held his hand when he had fairly\r\nprovided for our reasonable requirements. When he fills our bedrooms\r\nwith stationary basins, connects our refrigerators with the sewer,\r\nprovides twenty outlets for water which had better reach the drain\r\nthrough less than half that number, and incidentally underlays all our\r\nfloors with pipes, every foot of which is a possible source of danger,\r\nhe turns what ought to be a blessing into what is too often an\r\nunmitigated curse.\r\n\r\nIt will not be easy to convert persons who have become accustomed to\r\nthe universal diffusion of plumbing-works throughout the house to a\r\nbelief that their best sanitary interest, and, perhaps hardly less,\r\nthe best requirements of refinement, point to the abandonment of what\r\nis practically superfluous in the way of wash-bowls, bidets,\r\nfoot-baths, sitz-baths, urinals, etc.; but one who has given careful\r\nattention to the subject cannot hesitate to recommend that in a house\r\nwhich is \"strictly first class\" it would be the part of wisdom to\r\nreduce by at least three-fourths the openings which lead to the\r\nsoil-pipe and drain and sewer, and to concentrate upon the remaining\r\nfourth the flushing effect of wastes which are now so widely\r\ndistributed. Strenuous effort is being made, not only by those who\r\nwrite and talk in the interest of the plumber and manufacturer, but by\r\nmany who honestly believe that the good the plumber has to give us\r\ncannot be given with too free a hand, to prove that so long as they\r\nare properly constructed and properly arranged we may use plumbing\r\nappliances at every point in the house with the utmost freedom and\r\nwith a minimum of danger. The minimum of danger, and often more than\r\nthe minimum, does, however, exist. It exists, perhaps, in a constantly\r\nincreasing degree with every extension of the work, and it can only be\r\nthe part of wisdom to insist, so far as advice can have influence, on\r\nthe reduction of all these appliances to the least requirements of\r\nreasonable comfort and economy of labor. My own advice would be, in\r\nall cases, to permit the use of no wash-bowl or bath or other vessel\r\nat a greater distance than a few feet from a vertical soil-pipe, and\r\nnot to permit their use in any case in bedrooms or in closets opening\r\nonly into bedrooms.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of seeming extravagant, I would say that the stationary\r\nwash-bowl as ordinarily used is one of the most uncleanly of modern\r\nhousehold appliances. Long experience in the inspection of houses and\r\nin the examination of waste- and drain-pipes has led me to the belief\r\nthat servants, by no means rarely, use these vessels as the most\r\nconvenient means of voiding and cleansing chamber utensils. Their\r\noverflow-pipes are coated with soap and with the exuviæ of the skin to\r\na degree which makes them usually the seat of an offensive\r\ndecomposition. Their plugs and chains are almost invariably foul, and\r\nthose devices which provide for closing the outlets by valves or\r\nplugs, somewhat removed from the strainers at the bottom of the bowl,\r\nbring the water in which the face is washed into an interchanging\r\ncommunication with a considerable length of foul and uncleanable\r\nwaste-pipe--a communication that is made active by the bubbling of the\r\ncontained air as the pipe fills with water. The labor of filling\r\npitchers from a spigot on the same {217} floor, and the labor of\r\nemptying chamber-slops into a water-closet on the same floor, are not\r\nto be considered as compared with the greater cleanliness and the\r\ngreater sanitary security that such an arrangement ensures. There is\r\nno serious objection to the placing of wash-basins and baths in the\r\nsame apartment with the water-closet, or elsewhere immediately\r\nadjoining the soil-pipe; but it certainly cannot be disputed that the\r\nextension of the drainage system by horizontal lead pipes to remote\r\npoints is altogether and wholly to be condemned.\r\n\r\nHowever, the question more immediately at hand is that of the disposal\r\nof human excreta by the use of water-closets; and it is the\r\nwater-closet that first attracts the attention of one who is called\r\nupon to examine the sanitary condition of the work. There are several\r\nradical defects in water-closets, which are so widespread and which\r\nhave become so familiar to the world at large as to attract less\r\nattention than they deserve. For example, it is a radical defect of a\r\nwater-closet to be tightly encased in carpentry. Nearly all the\r\nwater-closets now in use have a somewhat complicated mechanism about\r\ntheir bowls. They consist in part of earthenware and in part of iron,\r\ngenerally with an unstable connection between the two. More often than\r\nnot they overflow or drip or leak, and whatever may escape from them,\r\nwhether foul air or foul water, is confined within an unventilated\r\nspace, but a space which is still not absolutely excluded from the\r\natmosphere of the house. The removal of the \"riser\" or vertical board\r\nunder the front of the seat will usually disclose at once a condition\r\nthat suggests at least the need for thorough ventilation. It also\r\ndiscloses in some cases a complication of machinery and pipes and\r\nlevers and chains which makes a thorough dusting and cleansing of the\r\nspace difficult, even were it accessible. There are water-closets\r\nwhich are essentially good in their construction and working, which it\r\nis important to protect by a \"riser,\" but this \"riser\" should never be\r\nof close work. It should at least be freely perforated with large\r\nholes, or, better still, be made with slats or blinds, so that there\r\nmay be the freest possible circulation of air under the seat. If there\r\nis an entire absence of machinery, so that the whole space may be left\r\nopen, being well finished with tiles or hard wood or other suitable\r\nmaterial, it is better that it should be unenclosed and that the seat\r\nshould be hung on hinges, so that it may be turned back, exposing the\r\nwhole space to easy cleansing. It is better too, in all cases, that\r\nthe ventilation should not even be interfered with by a cover over the\r\nseat, the freest possible exposure to the air being of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nA very large majority of the water-closets in use throughout the world\r\nare either very imperfectly flushed \"hoppers,\" which are generally\r\nfoul and which are often defective in their traps, or that worst of\r\nall forms, known as the \"pan\" closet, where a slight depth of water is\r\nheld in the bowl by a hinged pan closing over its outlet. This pan\r\nswings in an iron chamber under the bowl, which is entirely cut off\r\nfrom ventilation, which is generally foul with adhering fecal matter,\r\nand which as an abomination has no equal in the whole range of\r\nplumbing appliances. The closet of which it forms a part has\r\neverything to condemn it, and only its cheapness and its apparent\r\ncleanliness, and the habit of the world in its use, to commend it. If\r\nflushed, as it usually is, by a valve on the supply-pipe, it is rarely\r\nflushed adequately, and its use not seldom leads to an indraft {218}\r\nof foul air (or worse) into the main water-supply system of the house.\r\nSuch closets may be easily inspected as to their condition by shutting\r\noff the water-supply, opening the pan, and lowering a candle into the\r\ncontainer below. Such an inspection will almost invariably disclose an\r\nextremely and dangerously filthy condition. Yet the worst part of the\r\ncontainer, that which never receives an adequate flush, is even then\r\nconcealed from view by the pan being thrown back against it. The nose\r\nwill here be a good adjunct to the eye, and the odor escaping from\r\nthis filthy interior chamber will generally afford convincing\r\ntestimony of the impropriety of allowing such a vessel to remain in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIt is a rule almost without exception that closets, except perhaps on\r\nthe first floor of the house, which are flushed by valves connected\r\nwith the bowls, are to be condemned. However good or however bad the\r\nstate of a closet thus supplied with water, its condition will always\r\nbe improved by giving it a copious flush from an elevated cistern\r\ndelivering never less than two and a half gallons of water at each\r\nuse, and delivering it through a pipe so large and so direct as to\r\nsecure a thorough cleansing at every discharge.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place here to enter into a detailed description of\r\nthe various closets which are and which are not to be recommended for\r\nuse. So far as the physician's inspection is concerned, it is perhaps\r\nsufficient to say that wherever an odor, however slight, can be\r\nperceived, and wherever a fouling of the interior surfaces of the\r\nclosets or of the spaces under the seat can be detected by the eye,\r\nradical reformation is necessary. The only safety with a water-closet,\r\nas with any other vessel connected with the drainage of the house, is\r\nto secure an immediate and complete washing away of all foul matter of\r\nevery kind. Where this result is not attained, it should be insisted\r\nupon. This much lies within the province of the medical attendant; the\r\nmanner in which it shall be secured is not necessarily for him to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nOne other branch of this subject is worthy of attention. The\r\ncleanliness and freedom from offence of the water-closet or of a\r\nwaste-pipe or drain is in proportion to the frequency with which it is\r\nused and to the abundance of the discharge of water through it. A\r\ndozen closets used by a dozen persons will be quite likely all to be\r\noffensive. If the dozen persons all used only one closet--not a pan\r\ncloset--the frequency with which its trapping water is removed and the\r\nfrequency with which its walls are washed would secure its tolerable\r\ncondition, even if not of the best construction. In this case, as in\r\nall others, simplicity should be the controlling principle.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Dry conservancy next after water-carriage is the best and safest\r\nsystem for the removal of human excreta. By dry conservancy is meant\r\nthe admixture of dry earth, ashes, or similar material with the\r\nmatters to be disinfected and absorbed. Theoretically, the effect of\r\nsuch admixture is entirely satisfactory; under very careful and\r\nintelligent regulation it is practically so. It has been proved,\r\nhowever, by much experience that under ordinary circumstances--that\r\nis, where no greater care is given than is ordinarily given to a\r\nwater-closet or to a common privy--the dry conservancy system is open\r\nto serious objections, though always an improvement on the cruder\r\nprivy-vault. The theory of the effect of a sufficient admixture of\r\nearth or ashes with urine and fecal matter is, that by the {219}\r\nadmission of air thus secured to every part of the material there is a\r\ncomplete oxidation of their organic constituents, similar to, though\r\nslower in its operation than, actual combustion in an active fire. In\r\nisolated houses and in hospitals, factories, and other buildings not\r\nprovided with sewerage facilities, there is no question that the\r\nearth-closet or the ash-closet affords the best available means for\r\ndisposal, if we except a system, to be described hereafter, for the\r\ndistribution of water-carried wastes over or under the surface of\r\nsuitable ground.\r\n\r\nIncidentally--and this is of special interest to the physician--the\r\nuse of dry earth or of dry ashes in the close-stool of the sick\r\nchamber effects not only an immediate and complete deodorization, but\r\nwithout doubt a complete disinfection as well. A quart of dry earth at\r\nthe bottom of the vessel to receive the deposits, and rather more than\r\na quart with which immediately to cover them, constitutes a means of\r\nrelief always available and always efficient.\r\n\r\nWhere the house is provided only with an old-fashioned out-of-door\r\nprivy the greatest relief and the most complete security may be given\r\nat little cost by filling the vault, and placing under the seat a\r\nmovable box to receive the mixture of fecal matter and of the\r\nabsorbent material, which, if it is desired to avoid the simple\r\npatented appliances made for the purpose, may be kept in a box or\r\nbarrel in the apartment and thrown down after each use of the closet\r\nwith the hand-scoop. The objections to the common privy are so\r\nobvious, so universal, and so well understood that the practical value\r\nof such a means of relief should be appreciated without argument.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Privy-vaults are the sole reliance for the disposal of fecal\r\nmatter, and often of chamber-slops, of probably 95 per cent. of the\r\npopulation of this country, and of Europe as well. It is curious, in\r\nexamining the recommendations of public health officers and the\r\nrequirements of local boards of health, to observe the uniformity with\r\nwhich this most important subject is passed over with the prescription\r\nthat the vault shall be tight, sometimes that it shall be vaulted\r\nover, and sometimes that it shall not be within a certain small number\r\nof feet of a boundary-line or of a drinking-water well. These\r\nprescriptions are most absurd. It is safe to say, that of the millions\r\nof privy-vaults in this country not more than hundreds are really\r\ntight; that a still smaller number are so vaulted over as to prevent\r\nthe free exhalation of the gases of decomposition; that those which\r\nare so vaulted over are in all respects of worse sanitary effect than\r\nthose which have freer communication with the air, and that their\r\npossibilities of evil reach many times farther than the limits of\r\ndistance usually required to intervene between them and the well or\r\nthe neighboring property. In view of the universality of their use and\r\nof the completeness with which modern communities are inured to their\r\npresence, it seems almost hopeless to attempt to secure a proper\r\nrealization of their great defects. They are always the seat of the\r\nfoulest, and even of the most dangerous, decomposition. They taint not\r\nonly the air and the soil, but the water of the soil which goes so\r\noften to feed our sources of drinking-water, and their local stench is\r\nof itself sufficient to sicken all who have not by daily and lifelong\r\nhabit become accustomed to it. Taking the country at large--farm\r\nhouses and village houses as well as the dwellings of cities--it is\r\nnot too much to say that the best sanitary service that {220} can be\r\nrendered by those interested in the removal of causes of ill-health\r\nwould be in securing the abolition of these barbarous domestic\r\nappliances. In many ways the cesspool is as bad as the vault, but in\r\nsome respects the vault is facile princeps as a public and private\r\nnuisance of the most annoying and dangerous character. Wherever a\r\npublic or private sewer is available, wherever disposal by irrigation\r\nis possible, and wherever even the crudest attention can be secured\r\nfor an automatic or simpler earth-closet, the strongest effort should\r\nbe directed to the absolute inhibition of the common privy-vault.\r\n\r\nII. THE REMOVAL OF LIQUID HOUSEHOLD WASTES.--As has been stated above,\r\nthe liquid household wastes are of much more serious consequence from\r\na sanitary point of view, as compared with excrementitious matters,\r\nthan the public has been wont to suppose. These, owing to the large\r\namount of water which they contain, are beyond the reach of any system\r\nof dry conservancy. They consist almost invariably of a flood of water\r\ncontaining but a small percentage of refuse food, urine, soap, filth\r\nof the laundry, grease--everything, in fact, except fecal matter and\r\nthe coarser garbage and ashes--constituting the waste of the\r\nhousehold. Where water-closets are used fecal matter is generally\r\nadded to the flow, but its relative quantity is small, and its\r\npresence or absence does not seriously affect the problem of disposal.\r\n\r\nIn a house provided with abundant, generally superabundant, plumbing\r\nappliances, with a large consumption of water, the whole apparatus is\r\nconstructed on the theory that all manner of filth is to be taken up\r\nby running water and carried well without the house. Where this\r\ntheoretical end is completely attained there exists a condition of\r\ndrainage rarely met with and little to be criticised. Unfortunately,\r\nthe theoretical excellence is rarely secured. Running water confined\r\nwithin a narrow channel, and so compelled to move with force\r\nsufficient to give an energetic scouring to the walls of its conduit,\r\nmay be trusted to carry with it or to drive before it pretty nearly\r\nall foreign matter that may have been contributed to it, but the\r\nmoment this vigorous current is checked, that moment the tendency to\r\nexcessive deposit begins. It is checked in practice in various ways:\r\n\r\nFirst. By too great a diameter of the pipe: a volume of discharge\r\nrequiring a velocity of 4 feet per second in a pipe 1 inch in diameter\r\nwould have a velocity of only 1 foot per second in a channel 2 inches\r\nin diameter, and of less than 6 inches per second in a channel 3\r\ninches in diameter. Ordinarily, except as the deposits are removed by\r\ndecomposition (always objectionable), the deposited matters accumulate\r\nand reduce the original bore to the diameter which will secure a\r\ncleansing flow. It is the part of wisdom to provide only this bore at\r\nthe outset or not greatly to exceed it, and it is one of the earliest\r\nrecommendations of an experienced sanitary engineer to reduce the size\r\nof too large bores where they exist.\r\n\r\nSecond. By the use of traps larger than the pipes leading to them and\r\nfrom them, thus increasing the natural tendency of all traps to\r\nstagnation and deposit.\r\n\r\nThird. By the use of vertical waste-pipes, which are almost universal,\r\nand which are very often necessary. The velocity of a current measured\r\nalong the axis of the pipe is less if the direction is vertical than\r\nif it is laid on {221} a steep slope, because of the tendency of\r\nliquids flowing through vertical pipes, which they do not fill, to\r\nadhere to the walls and to travel with a rotary movement. I have seen\r\nvertical soil-pipes furred with excrement to a thickness of nearly\r\nthree-eighths of an inch; I have never seen a corresponding deposit in\r\na pipe of good slope where the current was direct. This latter point\r\nis rather one of curious interest than of practical value--certainly\r\nfrom the physician's point of view. Even in original construction it\r\nis rarely possible to give soil-pipes other than a practically\r\nvertical course as they pass from one story to the next. Indeed, the\r\nphysician need not trouble himself to consider the question of the\r\nsize or of the direction of this main channel. He will often find\r\noccasion to criticise the use of unduly large waste-pipes from single\r\nvessels; as, for example, two-inch pipes leading from bath-tubs; two\r\nand a half-inch pipes leading from laundry-tubs; and three-inch pipes\r\nleading from kitchen-sinks. Where reconstruction is to be undertaken,\r\nhe may with advantage exert himself to secure in these lateral\r\nwaste-pipes a diameter never exceeding one and a half inches, and from\r\nkitchen- and pantry-sinks, whose outflow is loaded with grease,\r\npreferably not exceeding the diameter of one and a half inches, with\r\ntraps of even a little less size. Where several vessels lead into the\r\nsame waste-pipe these small diameters may increase the tendency to the\r\nemptying of the traps by siphonage, but if proper mechanical traps are\r\nused for baths, wash-bowls, and laundry-tubs, and if ample flushing\r\nappliances are connected with kitchen- and pantry-sinks, the temporary\r\nremoval of the trapping-water by siphonage may generally be\r\ndisregarded. It will seldom happen that the removal of water will be\r\nso complete as to prevent the satisfactory closing of the mechanical\r\nvalve by capillarity, even if it fails, in itself, to make a perfectly\r\ntight fit.\r\n\r\nA favorite recent requirement of theoretical sanitarians, and one\r\nwhich has perhaps for business reasons been eagerly accepted by the\r\nplumbing trade, is what is called the \"back\" ventilation of traps;\r\nthat is, the carrying of a vent-pipe from every trap in the house to a\r\npoint above the roof. In my judgment, there is more to condemn than\r\nthere is to commend this practice, for I believe that the more rapid\r\nemptying of traps by evaporation where they are not constantly\r\nsupplied by frequent use, the dangers of accident to lead pipe, which\r\nis generally used for ventilating purposes, and the misapplication of\r\na large outlay which might better be applied in other directions,\r\nconstitute convincing arguments against this favorite new method of\r\npreserving the integrity of the water-seal. There are a number of\r\ntraps which are closed by floating balls, or by balls bearing upon the\r\noutlet, which seem to be quite satisfactory and efficient. The worst\r\nwaste-pipes, by far, are those of kitchen- and pantry-sinks which pass\r\na large amount of hot grease. This soon cools sufficiently to congeal,\r\nand it attaches itself to the walls of the pipe, where it does congeal\r\nuntil the bore is reduced to what is barely sufficient to furnish the\r\nnecessary limited water-way. Grease-traps of various forms have been\r\ninvented with a view to retaining this obstructing material. After\r\nmuch experience with all of them that have been in general use, I have\r\nbecome convinced that the only satisfactory way to avoid the\r\ndifficulty in question is to retain the outflow of the sink until a\r\ncertain considerable quantity has accumulated, and until its grease\r\nhas entirely {222} congealed, then to discharge the whole volume\r\nrapidly through a pipe of small calibre. This may be done with\r\nCarson's grease-trap by throwing in a pail of water to start a siphon\r\naction when the vessel has become filled to its overflow-point. It is\r\nmore simply accomplished by a device of my own, wherein the whole\r\noutflow is retained by a plug at the bottom of a large vessel working\r\nafter the manner of the plug of a wash-basin, until it is filled to\r\nthe level of the sink, and then opening the outlet for its sudden\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nGood workmanship is as important as, if not indeed more important\r\nthan, good arrangement. It seems a very simple proposition to say that\r\nall waste-pipes, whose office it is to carry foul liquids out of the\r\nhouse, should be made tight in material and in joint. It is a\r\nremarkable fact, however, that leaky joints in soil-pipes and in\r\ndrains are by no means rare. Probably there are few houses, very few,\r\nin which they do not occur. The soil-pipe is put together by inserting\r\nthe small end of each section into the bell at the top of the section\r\nbelow it, practically like putting the outlet of one funnel into the\r\nlarger upper portion of another. There may be abundant space for\r\nleakage at every joint from the top to the bottom of the house,\r\nwithout there being the least show of the leakage of water. The foul\r\nair within the pipe may escape freely through a dozen openings, while\r\nthe heavier liquid flow takes its easiest and most direct course\r\ndownward from the point of one pipe through the bell of the one below.\r\nWhen we come to the horizontal run of the soil-pipe in the basement,\r\nif an imperfection of the joint occurs on the lower side there is an\r\nobvious drip, which continues at least until closed by rust. Similar\r\nimperfections in other parts of the joint would not be so manifested.\r\nIt has recently been demonstrated that there is no safety in the\r\nconstruction of soil-pipes short of that absolute assurance which can\r\nbe secured only by an efficient test. Plugging all the outlets of the\r\nsoil-pipe and filling it with water, the slightest leak will be\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nHowever defective may be the condition of an iron soil-pipe, vertical\r\nor horizontal, it is perfection itself compared with the usual state\r\nof a drain laid under the cellar floor; and here is a point where the\r\nleast experienced inspector of house drainage cannot be mistaken.\r\nUnder all circumstances, at least in all work hitherto executed, he\r\nshould demand as absolutely necessary that the drains under the cellar\r\nfloor be removed, that the earth which has been fouled by the leakage\r\nof its joints and its breaks shall be taken out to the clean untainted\r\nsoil below, and refilled with well-rammed pure earth or with concrete,\r\nthe drainage being carried through a properly-jointed iron pipe above\r\nthe pavement, and preferably with a fall from the ceiling of the\r\ncellar to near the floor at the point of outlet--in full sight for the\r\nwhole distance. It sometimes happens that the necessity for using\r\nlaundry-tubs or other vessels in the cellar makes the retention of an\r\nunderground course imperative. When retained, the drain should be of\r\nheavy cast iron with most securely leaded joints tested under a head\r\nof several feet. When found to be tight and secure, it should not be,\r\nas ordinarily recommended, left in an open channel covered with boards\r\nor flags and surrounded by a vermin-breeding, unventilated and\r\nuninspected space, but closely and completely imbedded in the best\r\nhydraulic cement mortar. Its careful testing before this {223}\r\nenclosure is of course the only condition under which the work can be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nTightness of all waste-pipes being secured, the next point in order is\r\ntheir proper ventilation. A good deal has been said, and little has\r\nbeen proved, about the different effects on the human system of the\r\ngases of decomposition which have been produced in the absence of a\r\nsufficient circulation of air, and those produced where the\r\nventilation and dilution are more complete. The probabilities of the\r\ncase are, of course, entirely in favor of the latter condition, and it\r\nis accepted by all sanitarians as an axiom that all water-ways and all\r\nvessels in which organic decomposition, even the decomposition of\r\nadhering slime, takes place, should be ventilated as thoroughly as\r\npossible. Until about ten years ago nearly all waste-pipes were\r\ntightly closed at the top, and were shut from the sewer by a trap at\r\nthe foot, allowing absolutely no communication between the outer air\r\nand the atmosphere of the pipe except as fresh air might be carried in\r\nthrough the water-seals of the traps at each end. At about that time\r\nit was becoming the general custom in the better class of work to\r\ncarry a small vent-pipe, often only one inch in diameter, rarely more\r\nthan two inches in diameter, through the roof of the house, closing it\r\nat the top and perforating it with a few inefficient holes. This had\r\nundoubtedly the effect of relieving the pressure on the atmosphere of\r\nthe pipe caused by the filling of unventilated sewers with tide-water\r\nor storm-water, or by a sudden increase of temperature from the\r\nadmission of hot water. Later, it was accepted as a universal rule,\r\nand it became a quite general practice, to carry the soil-pipe above\r\nthe roof with its full diameter, providing its summit with some form\r\nof ventilating cowl. All this constituted not ventilation, but\r\nventing. Real ventilation was introduced only with the very recent\r\nimprovement of admitting fresh air at the foot of the soil-pipe, so as\r\nto make a complete circulation from one end to the other--a\r\ncirculation sufficient to produce, by the diffusion of gases, a very\r\nfair ventilation of lateral waste-pipes of moderate length. It is now\r\ncoming to be understood that ventilating cowls, of whatever form, are\r\nan obstruction to the movement of air in the absence of wind, and\r\nthat, as what is needed is never a vigorous current, but always a\r\nliving one, these cowls had better be dispensed with. We have learned,\r\ntoo, that the most efficient means for increasing the flow of air\r\nthrough the top is to increase its diameter at the top, enlarging the\r\nhighest length of a four-inch pipe, for example, to a diameter of six\r\ninches. With this arrangement, and with a foot-ventilation four inches\r\nin diameter opening at a point where it can never be obstructed by\r\nrubbish or by snow, there will be secured a condition perhaps more\r\nefficient in improving the condition of an imperfectly drained house\r\nthan any other one thing that may be done.\r\n\r\nI have sketched above, in a very hurried manner, the main outline of a\r\nsystem of house-drainage which may be accepted or which may be\r\nrecommended by a physician with confidence of securing a good result.\r\nTo go more into detail in technical matters would be out of place in a\r\npaper of this character. Before leaving this subject, however, it is\r\nimportant to call attention to the fact that what is recognized in our\r\nhouses as sewer gas is in far greater degree the product of\r\ndecomposition taking place within the house-drains themselves than the\r\nproduct {224} of decomposition in the distant sewer forced into the\r\nhouse through its connecting drain. It is emphatically a case of the\r\nbeam in our own eye as compared with the mote in the eye of our\r\nneighbor. It is a rule which has exceptions, but they are few, that\r\nthe contained air of the house-pipes is far worse than the contained\r\nair of the sewer; and the conviction is growing that the use of a trap\r\nto the main drain between the house and the public sewer is more often\r\nobjectionable than advantageous. Such a trap always tends to check the\r\nflow of the drain and to induce deposits whose decomposition is\r\nobjectionable. Wherever the abandonment of the trap is anything like\r\nuniversal the considerable ventilation of the sewer thereby secured\r\nbrings its atmosphere to a condition which makes it not objectionable,\r\nand generally useful, as a source of movement in the air of the\r\ninterior drain- and soil-pipe.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Public sewers are more or less good or bad entirely according to\r\ntheir character and condition. As a rule, a well-flushed sewer which\r\nis used for no other purpose than the removal of foul waste, built on\r\nwhat is called the separate system, and automatically flushed at least\r\ndaily, may be considered to be, if well laid and tightly jointed,\r\nabsolutely safe. A public sewer of large size and of irregular\r\nconstruction, receiving not only household wastes, but the wash of\r\nstreets as well, may be regarded at least as an object of grave\r\nsuspicion. These general statements may be so far qualified by the\r\ncharacter of the sewers of each class as to run very nearly together;\r\nthat is to say, separate sewers, with leaky joints, irregular grades,\r\ndefective alignment, insufficient flushing, and inadequate restriction\r\nas to the matters they are to receive, will be an intolerable and\r\ndangerous nuisance; on the other hand, a large brick sewer built in\r\nthe best manner and of the best material, with sufficient fall and\r\nsufficient supply to maintain itself in a cleanly condition, is free\r\nfrom the serious drawbacks which usually attach to sewers of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWith sewerage as with house-drainage it is not worth while to attempt\r\nhere to give anything like detailed directions for inspection and for\r\nreformation. It will suffice to call attention to this one broad and\r\ngeneral rule: Every sewer or drain having for its object the removal\r\nof putrescible organic matters must be so arranged as to maintain\r\nitself in a condition of practically absolute cleanliness, without, as\r\nin the case of storm-water sewers, waiting for the flushing effect of\r\nstorms, which often come only at long intervals, during which the\r\nworst condition of decomposition may be established. Whether the sewer\r\nbe intended for drainage only or for both drainage- and storm-water,\r\nif it contains at any time deposits of any kind, it is defective--more\r\nor less so, of course, according to the extent and duration of the\r\naccumulation.\r\n\r\nAlthough it should be rigidly insisted upon in every case that the\r\nsewer should maintain itself free from deposits, there will still be,\r\nunavoidably, a certain amount of foul gas produced by the\r\ndecomposition of the matters coating its walls, and in order to dilute\r\nand to remove this, and perhaps in order to modify their original\r\ncharacter, the most thorough ventilation is necessary.\r\n\r\nAny sewer or other drain which at any time gives forth the odor of\r\nputrid decomposition is in bad condition and should be at once\r\nrendered inoffensive. So far as I know, there is no exception to this\r\nrule. I have met no conditions in towns of any size where absolute\r\nself-cleansing may {225} not be secured. It is worth while, however,\r\nto repeat here the statement made above, that sewer gas, in so far as\r\nit is a serious factor in connection with the drainage of houses, is\r\nthe product of the interior pipes of the house much more frequently\r\nthan of the public sewer in the street.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The disposal of liquid wastes by irrigation, so far as this\r\nmethod is applied to the outflow of public sewers, is not of especial\r\ninterest here, but an important modification has been made of the\r\nsystem of irrigation which is of the greatest consequence in\r\nconsidering the sanitary improvement of isolated country-houses, of\r\nhospitals, prisons, etc., and of houses in towns about which there is\r\na small amount of available land. The process which has been found\r\nbest suited to the purpose is the invention of the Rev. Henry Moule,\r\nthe inventor of the earth-closet. He found it a serious drawback to\r\nthe dry-earth system that it was incapable of taking care of the\r\nliquid wastes of the house. He devised a method of conducting the\r\nliquid into very shallow drains made with open-jointed agricultural\r\ndrain-tiles, so porous in their character as to allow the liquid\r\ncarried by them to escape at the joints into the soil, and thus get\r\nthe benefit of its purifying qualities without the unsightly and often\r\noffensive process of allowing the liquid to flow over the surface. The\r\nfirst use made of this system was about 1866. Since that time its use\r\nhas extended very considerably both here and in England, and many\r\nimprovements have been made in its details, so that it may now be\r\naccepted as entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe process in its best development, as applied to the drainage of\r\nsingle houses, may be thus described, many of the appliances used\r\nbeing the subject of patents: The outflow from the house is delivered\r\ninto a settling-basin or grease-trap of sufficient size to still the\r\nflow, to cause solids to settle to the bottom, and grease and other\r\nlight matters to float at the top. The outlet from this basin is\r\nthrough a pipe having its inlet at some distance below its\r\noverflow-point; that is, at the level of the comparatively clarified\r\nliquid, below the grease and above the sediment. The outflow passes\r\ninto another vessel known as a flush-tank, where it accumulates until\r\nit reaches the summit of a self-acting siphon. This height being\r\nreached, any considerable addition to the flow sets the siphon in\r\naction, and the whole contents of the flush-tank are discharged with\r\nrapidity into the drain beyond. The discharge completed, air is\r\nautomatically admitted to the siphon, and no further flow can take\r\nplace until the flush-tank has again been filled. The drain, of iron\r\nor vitrified pipes tightly joined, is continued to the edge of the\r\nground prepared for purification. It here delivers into a series of\r\nopen-jointed agricultural tiles, laid with their bottoms not more than\r\nten inches below the surface of the ground. The total length of these\r\ntile-drains is regulated according to the discharging capacity of the\r\nflush-tank, with a view to their becoming entirely filled at each\r\ndischarge. Within a short time after the flow has ceased the liquid\r\nhas all left the pipes and entered the soil, its impurities being\r\nretained and its filtered water settling away into the porous or\r\nartificially drained ground below. During the interval between the\r\ndischarges of the flush-tank, a day or more, the process of\r\npurification (oxidation) of the retained impurities goes on in the\r\nsoil, and its thorough aëration prepares it to purify the next\r\ndischarge. This method of {226} disposal is now employed in connection\r\nwith hundreds of houses, and its use, which has in some cases\r\ncontinued for a dozen years, is constantly increasing. Its application\r\nimplies a certain amount of fall, but this amount need not be great.\r\nThe discharging height of the tank need not be more than twelve\r\ninches. The main outlet need not fall more rapidly than at the rate of\r\n1 to 300, and the absorption-drains ought not to fall more rapidly\r\nthan at the rate of 1 to 600. If the tank can be built on the top of\r\nthe ground, an average surface fall of 1 to 400 can usually be made to\r\nmeet all the requirements. Where waste matters are to be removed from\r\ncellars and basements below the level of the ground, a greater fall is\r\nnecessary, or the wastes which are there collected must be thrown to\r\nthe tank by pumping or otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a bit of grass-land a little removed from the house\r\n(and from sight), it answers a perfectly satisfactory purpose to\r\ndispense with the absorption-drains and to deliver the main outlet\r\ndirectly on to the surface of the ground. The effect in both cases is\r\nentirely different from what it would be were the flow of the drains\r\nnot regulated by the use of the flush-tank. The moment we have a\r\nconstant slight discharge, either on the surface of the ground or into\r\nthe absorption-drains, we establish a condition of constant saturation\r\nwhich leads to the over-fouling of a small area, which is rarely if\r\never purified by aëration. For an intermittent discharge some form of\r\nflush-tank is an absolute necessity. It is often found in practice,\r\nwhere the flow from the house is considerable, that the discharge of\r\nthe house-drains into the settling-basin produces such an agitation of\r\nits contents as to set in motion and to carry into the flush-tank bits\r\nof paper partly macerated, grease, etc. This has been met by a recent\r\nimprovement, which consists in building a transverse wall in the\r\nsettling-basin, which checks the current from the house-drain and\r\ncauses the flow from the house side of the wall to pass over its top\r\nin a thin small current which does not materially agitate the contents\r\nof that part of the basin from which the outflow pipe is fed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The cesspool is still the chief reliance of the world at large.\r\nThere is nothing to be said in its favor save what may be based on the\r\nold adage that \"what is out of sight is out of mind.\" There is\r\neverything to be said in its condemnation, whether we regard its\r\ncontents as a great mass of putrefying and infecting filth, as the\r\nsource of oozings which travel through crevices of rocks, through\r\nlayers of gravel, through seams in clay, or through lighter soils into\r\nand under cellars and into drinking-water wells and defectively\r\nconstructed cisterns, or as an ever-active gas-retort supplying the\r\npipes of the house with the foulest products of putrefaction. It is in\r\nall respects and under all circumstances a curse, unless placed far\r\naway from the possibility of tainting the air we breathe or the soil\r\nover which we live, or from which we or others take our\r\ndrinking-water, and even then it had better be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe simple drainage of the soil involves a question of the greatest\r\nimportance. If the ground under the house or about it is at any time,\r\nunless perhaps immediately after heavy rains, saturated with moisture,\r\nwe have to apprehend a condition of insalubrity more or less serious\r\nin proportion to the degree of saturation and the degree of foulness\r\nwith which this is associated. The drainage requirements of land\r\noutside of the house are less easily determined, but it requires\r\nnothing more than a casual {227} examination of the cellar in\r\nordinarily wet weather to determine whether or not an improvement of\r\nits soil-water drainage is necessary. If it is at such times wet, or\r\neven persistently damp, thorough drainage is demanded; and it is only\r\nnecessary to say that this should be secured by some process which can\r\nunder no circumstances bring the air of the cellar into communication\r\nwith the air of a sewer or foul drain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have purposely abstained in the foregoing remarks from invading the\r\nprovince of the physician or the physiologist by discussing the\r\ninfluence of bad drainage on the health of those living subject to it.\r\nIt may safely be assumed that physicians who care enough about the\r\nsubject to interest themselves in investigating the condition of local\r\nor general drainage have convictions concerning it which could not be\r\nstrengthened by the opinion of one belonging to another profession.\r\nThe assumption is also confidently made that no intelligent medical\r\nman will hesitate for a moment to accept the dictum that the site of\r\nthe house must be dry, and that it and its neighborhood must be\r\nentirely exempt from the influence of foul organic decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{229}\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SPECIAL MORBID AGENTS OPERATING FROM WITHOUT.\r\n\r\n  SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER.\r\n\r\n  TYPHOID FEVER.\r\n\r\n  TYPHUS FEVER.\r\n\r\n  RELAPSING FEVER.\r\n\r\n  VARIOLA.\r\n\r\n  VACCINIA.\r\n\r\n  VARICELLA.\r\n\r\n  SCARLET FEVER.\r\n\r\n  RUBEOLA.\r\n\r\n  RÖTHELN.\r\n\r\n  MALARIAL FEVERS.\r\n\r\n  PAROTITIS.\r\n\r\n  ERYSIPELAS.\r\n\r\n  YELLOW FEVER.\r\n\r\n  DIPHTHERIA.\r\n\r\n  CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n  PLAGUE.\r\n\r\n  LEPROSY.\r\n\r\n  EPIDEMIC CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.\r\n\r\n  PERTUSSIS.\r\n\r\n  INFLUENZA.\r\n\r\n  DENGUE.\r\n\r\n  RABIES AND HYDROPHOBIA.\r\n\r\n  GLANDERS AND FARCY.\r\n\r\n  MALIGNANT PUSTULE.\r\n\r\n  PYÆMIA AND SEPTICÆMIA.\r\n\r\n  PUERPERAL FEVER.\r\n\r\n  BERIBERI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{231}\r\n\r\nSIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES H. HUTCHINSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A continued, non-contagious fever, varying in duration\r\nfrom one to twelve days, and in temperate climates almost invariably\r\nending in recovery. It may arise from any non-specific cause capable\r\nof producing a temporary derangement of one or more of the important\r\nfunctions of the body, is generally easily distinguished from the\r\nother continued fevers by the absence of the characteristic symptoms\r\nof these diseases, and presents in fatal cases no specific lesions.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Synocha, vel Synochus Simplex, Febricula, Ephemera or\r\nEphemeral Fever, Irritative Fever, Ardent Continued Fever, Sun Fever.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--Much difference of opinion continues to prevail, even at the\r\npresent time, in regard to the existence of a simple continued fever,\r\nwhich, on the one hand, occurs independently of local inflammations or\r\ntraumatic causes, and, on the other, is distinct from typhoid, typhus,\r\nand relapsing fevers; many observers contending that the condition to\r\nwhich this name is given is only a mild or modified form of one or\r\nother of the graver varieties of continued fever, from which the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms are absent. Prominently among modern writers,\r\nDr. Tweedie[1] has taken this view of the subject, for, after\r\nreviewing the arguments for and against the recognition of simple\r\ncontinued fever as a distinct disease, he asserts that there is not\r\nsufficient evidence to justify us in encumbering our nosology with a\r\ndoubtful novelty. If, however, there is room for doubt as to its right\r\nto a place in the list of diseases, there is certainly no good reason\r\nfor characterizing it as a novelty, since it has been referred to,\r\naccording to Murchison,[2] by many authors from the time of\r\nHippocrates down to the present day, who not only separate it from the\r\ngraver forms of fever, and give a very accurate description of its\r\nsymptoms, but seem to have been perfectly familiar with the causes\r\nwhich give rise to it, and to have had very correct notions as to its\r\nproper management. Thus, Riverius[3] was aware of the existence of two\r\nforms of simple fever--the ephemeral, which lasts, as its name\r\nimplies, only a single day, and the Synochus Simplex, arising from the\r\nsame causes, but in which the fever continues for from four to seven\r\ndays. Strother[4] and Ball[5] also allude to this fever in terms that\r\nleave no doubt upon the mind but that they distinguished it clearly\r\nfrom other forms of continued fever. {232} Among more recent writers\r\nwho have made this distinction may be mentioned Lyons,[6] Jenner,[7]\r\nG. B. Wood,[8] Flint,[9] Murchison,[10] and J. C. Wilson.[11] Indeed,\r\nthe weight of authority is decidedly on the side of those who claim\r\nfor it a recognition as a distinct and separate disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lectures on the Continued Fevers_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _A Treatise on the Continued Fevers of Great Britain_,\r\nLondon, 1873.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _The Practice of Physick, being chiefly a Translation of\r\nthe Works of Lazarus Riverius_, London, 1678.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _A Critical Essay on Fever_, 1718.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _A Treatise on Fevers_, London, 1758.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _A Treatise on Fever_, London, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Medical Times_, March 22, 1851.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _A Treatise on the Practice of Medicine_, Philadelphia,\r\n1855.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice of Medicine_,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _A Treatise on the Continued Fevers_, New York, 1881.]\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, many cases which have been classed under the head of\r\nsimple continued fever, are really mild or abortive cases of typhoid\r\nor typhus fever, in which, in consequence of partial protection on the\r\npart of the patient, the characteristic symptoms of these diseases\r\nhave not been developed. Such cases are seen in numbers during\r\nepidemics of these diseases. But, making due allowance for this source\r\nof error, there yet remain many cases which cannot be thus explained.\r\nMoreover, the disease occurs at times when no such epidemics exist. It\r\nmay, therefore, be safely assumed that there is such a fever, and\r\nthat, consequently, it must be accorded full recognition.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--Any non-specific cause which is capable of producing a\r\nprofound derangement of one or more of the important functions of the\r\nbody may give rise to simple continued fever. It may follow,\r\ntherefore, upon excesses of the table, extreme mental or bodily\r\nfatigue, exposure to the direct rays of the sun, or to great heat or\r\ncold, or upon the suppression of a secretion. One of its most frequent\r\ncauses is over-exertion in warm weather. James C. Wilson has called\r\nattention to its frequent occurrence as a consequence of the combined\r\ninfluence of the excitement, the physical exhaustion, and the exposure\r\nto the direct rays of the mid-day sun which are attendant upon\r\nsurf-bathing. It is often due in young children to the irritation\r\ninvolved in the process of teething or to that caused by the presence\r\nof worms in the alimentary canal. Wood taught that it might also\r\nsometimes occur during the prevalence of contagious diseases as an\r\neffect of the epidemic influence in those who were partially protected\r\nby a previous attack of the disease, or from some other cause, but it\r\nis more probable that cases arising under these circumstances are\r\neither mild cases of the prevalent disease or else are attributable to\r\nfatigue from nursing or to over-anxiety. The disease is more common in\r\nthe young than in the old, and in children than in adults--probably\r\nfrom the greater impressionability of the nervous systems of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the ardent continued fever of the tropics, which is\r\nusually recognized as a form of simple continued fever, do not differ\r\nmaterially, except in degree, from those of the simpler forms of the\r\ndisease; but exposure to the direct rays of the sun would seem to be\r\nespecially prone to give rise to the disease in those who are\r\nunaccustomed to the heat of a tropical climate. Robust young Europeans\r\nlately arrived in a warm country are, it is said, peculiarly liable to\r\nsuffer from it.[12] It is most common in those parts of India which do\r\nnot experience much of the benefit of the monsoon rains, and whose hot\r\nseason is not tempered by regular breezes from the sea. It is hence\r\nmore frequently met with {233} in inland districts in which the\r\ntemperature is high, but in which malaria-generating conditions are\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Morehead, _Clinical Researches on Diseases in India_,\r\nLondon, 1856; also Twining, _Clinical Illustrations of the More\r\nImportant Diseases of Bengal_, Calcutta, 1835.]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Simple continued fever occurs in this country\r\nonly as a sporadic disease, and almost invariably ends in recovery; in\r\ntropical climates, however, it may prevail epidemically, and sometimes\r\npresents symptoms of a very grave character. In its mildest form it\r\nnot infrequently runs its course in a few hours, and is rarely\r\nprolonged much beyond twenty-four, and is hence called ephemera. It\r\nthen usually begins somewhat abruptly with a chill, but in a few\r\ninstances this is preceded by feelings of languor and weariness.\r\nFebrile reaction is soon established, and is generally well marked;\r\nthe pulse is quick and full, the temperature rises rapidly, and the\r\nface is flushed. The tongue is coated with a whitish fur, the urine is\r\nscanty and high-colored, and the bowels are constipated. Other\r\nsymptoms are excessive thirst, headache, restlessness, and\r\nsleeplessness, or, on the other hand, a tendency to somnolence.\r\nVomiting is not common except in those cases which follow upon an\r\nerror of diet, but there is generally some nausea and anorexia.\r\nMuscular pains are also occasionally present, and may give rise to a\r\ngood deal of distress. The subsidence of these symptoms is often quite\r\nas abrupt as their onset, the crisis being frequently marked by a\r\ncopious perspiration.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however, the fever is more prolonged, and the\r\nsymptoms, although not differing in kind, are apt to be more severe\r\nthan those above detailed. The pulse is often full, hard, and\r\nbounding; the headache throbbing or darting in character; the tendency\r\nto somnolence increases, or gives place to delirium; and the pyrexia\r\nis more marked. Frequently an eruption of herpes is observed upon the\r\nlips and upon other parts of the face, from which circumstance the\r\ndisease is sometimes called herpetic fever. Davasse[13] also observed\r\nin a few cases pale bluish spots, not elevated above the surface and\r\nnot disappearing under pressure, which are identical with the tâches\r\nbleuâtres sometimes seen in typhoid fever and other diseases, and\r\ntherefore have no diagnostic value. In this form the duration of the\r\ndisease may be from four to ten or twelve days. The defervescence is\r\nusually less rapid than the rise in temperature, and is generally\r\naccompanied by a free perspiration, diarrhoea, a copious deposit of\r\nurates in the urine, or less frequently by hemorrhage from the uterus\r\nor rectum,[14] or from the nose, mouth, or urethra. This constitutes\r\nthe synocha or inflammatory fever of the older writers. In children in\r\nwhom there is no reason to suspect malarial poisoning the disease\r\nsometimes assumes a remittent form, and then constitutes a variety of\r\nthe infantile remittent fever of authors--a name, however, which, it\r\nmust be remembered, has been made to include a great many distinct\r\ndiseases.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Murchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Lyons.]\r\n\r\nWhen the disease occurs in individuals who are broken down in health\r\nfrom any cause[16]--as, for instance, previous illness, deficient\r\nfood, long-continued anxiety, or great fatigue--it not infrequently\r\npresents symptoms of an asthenic character. The febrile reaction is\r\nthen less intense, and the pulse feebler and more frequent, than in\r\nthe variety just described. The duration of the disease in this form\r\nis also generally longer. Murchison has proposed for it the name of\r\nsimple asthenic fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Wood.]\r\n\r\nUnder the name of ardent continued fever, Indian medical writers have\r\ndescribed a variety of the disease which is frequently met with in\r\ntropical {234} countries, and which is usually much more severe than\r\nthe varieties already referred to. In addition to the symptoms\r\npresented by these, Morehead[17] says that there is often intolerance\r\nof light and sound, contracted and subsequently dilated pupils,\r\nringing noises in the ears, anxious respiration, pains in the limbs\r\nand loins, and a sense of oppression at the epigastrium. The bowels\r\nare sometimes confined; at others vitiated bilious discharges take\r\nplace. The tongue is white, often with florid edges, and the urine\r\nscanty and high-colored. At the end of from forty-eight to sixty hours\r\nthe febrile phenomena may subside, the skin become cold, and death\r\ntake place from exhaustion and sudden collapse. In some cases the\r\nsymptoms of cerebral disturbance are greater in degree, and in these\r\ncoma may soon supervene upon delirium. Convulsions, epileptiform in\r\ncharacter, with relaxation of the sphincters and suppression of urine,\r\nalso frequently occur, and occasionally cerebral hemorrhage. In other\r\ncases the symptoms of gastritis are more prominent, or jaundice may\r\nappear and aggravate the disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Clinical Researches on Disease in India_, London, 1856.\r\nSee also \"Croonian Lectures,\" by Sir Joseph Fayrer, _Brit. Med.\r\nJour._, April 29, 1882.]\r\n\r\nSymptoms closely resembling those just described are occasionally met\r\nwith in this country in patients who have been exposed for some time\r\nto the direct rays of the summer sun, but who have escaped a\r\nsunstroke. Indeed, a few writers have been so much impressed with the\r\ngeneral resemblance which this latter condition bears to the fevers\r\nthat they have insisted upon including it in this group, and have\r\ngiven it the name of thermic or heat fever. This view of the pathology\r\nof sunstroke has, however, never been generally accepted.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic symptoms of the disease in all its\r\nforms is the rapid rise of temperature, which may in ephemera be as\r\ngreat as from four to seven degrees in the course of a few hours, and\r\nwhich may be followed in a few hours more by an equally abrupt\r\ndefervescence. When the fever is more prolonged, although the\r\ntemperature rises rapidly, it may not attain its greatest elevation\r\nfor from forty to sixty hours after the onset of the symptoms, and its\r\nfall will be more gradual than in the preceding variety.\r\nUnfortunately, there are no reliable thermometric records of ardent\r\ncontinued fever. The urine is usually scanty and high-colored during\r\nthe height of the fever, especially in the severer forms of the\r\ndisease. Its specific gravity is high, and it contains a large amount\r\nof solids, especially of urea. With the fall of the temperature it\r\nrapidly increases in quantity, and is very apt to let fall a copious\r\nlateritious sediment on cooling. According to Parkes,[18] who closely\r\nobserved six cases with the view of determining this question,\r\nalbuminuria does not occur at any stage of the disease. Convalescence\r\nis usually rapid, and is not liable to be interrupted by the\r\noccurrence of sequelæ.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _The Composition of the Urine_, by Edmund A. Parkes,\r\nM.D., London, 1860.]\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis in those cases of simple continued fever in\r\nwhich the connection between the disease and some one of the\r\nconditions which have been referred to above as capable of exciting it\r\nhas been distinctly made out, presents little difficulty. It is\r\notherwise, however, when this relationship is not apparent. Indeed,\r\nthe symptoms of the disease so closely resemble those of an abortive\r\nor mild attack of typhoid or typhus fever, in which the characteristic\r\neruption is wanting, that the {235} physician may sometimes remain in\r\ndoubt as to the nature of the disease he has been called upon to\r\ntreat, even after the recovery of the patient. This difficulty will of\r\ncourse be especially likely to present itself during the epidemic\r\nprevalence of these diseases. Simple continued fever may, however,\r\ngenerally be distinguished from either of the latter by the much\r\ngreater severity of its initial symptoms, and particularly by the\r\nrapid rise of temperature--a rise of from four to seven degrees in the\r\ncourse of a few hours--which does not take place in these fevers, but\r\nwhich, it must be remembered, may occur in erysipelas, measles,\r\npneumonia, and some other diseases. The absence of a characteristic\r\neruption, although it would not render it certain, would be in favor\r\nof the diagnosis of simple continued fever, as would also the absence\r\nof diarrhoea in cases in which there was difficulty in deciding\r\nbetween this disease and typhoid fever. On the other hand, Murchison\r\nregards the presence of an herpetic eruption on the lips as almost\r\npathognomonic of simple continued fever; but in this country such an\r\neruption is not an infrequent attendant upon fevers of malarial\r\norigin, and many observers attach great importance to it in the\r\ndiagnosis of these diseases.\r\n\r\nSimple continued fever is not likely to be mistaken for relapsing\r\nfever, except during epidemics of the latter disease. It may be\r\ndiscriminated from relapsing fever, the first paroxysm of which it\r\nclosely resembles, by the absence of severe articular pains, of\r\ntenderness in the epigastric zone, of enlargement of the liver and\r\nspleen, and of jaundice. It may be mistaken for tubercular meningitis,\r\nespecially in those cases in which the nervous symptoms are more than\r\nusually prominent, or in which a hereditary predisposition to\r\ntuberculosis exists; but its true nature may generally be recognized\r\nby its more abrupt commencement, and by the absence of the constant\r\nvomiting, screaming fits, strabismus, and paralysis so characteristic\r\nof the latter disease.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that a local inflammation or a\r\ntraumatic cause may give rise to symptoms simulating those of simple\r\ncontinued fever, and that the diagnosis of this disease must be\r\nuncertain until these conditions have been positively ascertained to\r\nbe absent, or, if present, until they have been proved to be\r\ncomplications, and not the causes of the disease.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of this disease, as it is met with in this\r\ncountry, is favorable. Indeed, when uncomplicated it may be said to\r\nend invariably in recovery, except in the aged and feeble, in whom,\r\nwhen it occurs during the great heat of the summer season, it is apt\r\nto assume the asthenic form, and to be accompanied by symptoms of a\r\ngrave character. The ardent continued fever of the tropics, on the\r\nother hand, not infrequently terminates fatally, or may leave the\r\nsufferer from it a chronic invalid for life, which is frequently\r\nshortened by obscure cerebral or meningeal changes, which give rise to\r\nirritability, impaired memory, epilepsy, headache, mania, partial or\r\ncomplete paraplegia, or blindness.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Sir Joseph Fayrer, K.C.S.I., M.D., F.R.S., _Brit. Med.\r\nJour._, April 29, 1881, p. 607.]\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL LESIONS.--Death so rarely occurs in this latitude from\r\nsimple continued fever that the opportunities for making post-mortem\r\nexaminations do not often occur. There are, however, a sufficient\r\nnumber of such examinations on record to show that the disease gives\r\n{236} rise to no specific lesions. According to Murchison and\r\nMartin,[20] inspection in fatal cases of ardent continued fever\r\nusually reveals the presence of great congestion of all the internal\r\norgans and of the sinuses of the brain and pia mater, of an increased\r\namount of intracranial fluid, and occasionally of an effusion into the\r\nabdominal cavity, and more rarely into the thoracic cavity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _The Influence of Tropical Climates on European\r\nConstitutions_, by James Ranald Martin, F.R.S., London, 1856.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--In the milder forms of the disease little or no treatment\r\nis required--a fact which seems to have been recognized and acted upon\r\nlong ago, since Strother remarks that the cure of it is so easy that\r\nphysicians are seldom consulted about such patients. An emetic when\r\nthe attack has been caused by excesses of the table, and there is\r\nreason to believe that there is undigested food in the stomach, a\r\npurgative when constipation exists, and cooling drinks, the\r\neffervescing draught or some other saline diaphoretic, are usually the\r\nonly remedies that are called for. In cases in which the febrile\r\naction is more intense and prolonged, in addition to the use of these\r\nremedies an effort should be made to reduce the heat of the skin and\r\nthe frequency of the pulse by sponging with cold water and by the\r\nadministration of digitalis and aconite. The headache which is often a\r\ndistressing symptom may usually be relieved by the application of\r\nevaporating lotions, and restlessness quieted by the bromides.\r\nSubsequently, quinia may be given with advantage. The patient should\r\nbe restricted to liquid diet during the continuance of fever.\r\n\r\nIn the asthenic form quinia and the mineral acids, nutritious food,\r\nand very frequently alcoholic stimulants, must be given from the\r\nbeginning. In the treatment of the ardent continued fever of the\r\ntropics the cold affusion or the cold bath, with quinia, would appear\r\nto be indicated, but Morehead and other Indian physicians advise the\r\nuse of evacuants with copious and repeated venesections, cupping, and\r\nleeches, aided by tartar emetic, till all local determination and the\r\nchief urgent symptoms are removed; and Murchison expresses the belief,\r\nfounded on his own observations, that life is often sacrificed by\r\nadopting less active measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{237}\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES H. HUTCHINSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An endemic infectious fever, usually lasting between\r\nthree and four weeks, and associated with constant lesions of the\r\nsolitary and agminate glands of the ileum, and with enlargement of the\r\nspleen and mesenteric glands. Its invasion is usually gradual and\r\noften insidious. Sometimes the only symptoms present in the beginning\r\nare a feeling of lassitude, some gastric derangement, and a slight\r\nelevation of temperature; at others there are slight rigors or chilly\r\nsensations, headache, epistaxis, diarrhoea, and pain in the abdomen.\r\nThe principal symptoms of the fully-formed disease are a febrile\r\nmovement possessing certain characters, headache passing into delirium\r\nand stupor, diarrhoea associated with ochrey-yellow stools,\r\ntympanites, pain and gurgling in the right iliac fossa, a red and\r\nfurred tongue, which later often becomes dry, brown, and fissured; a\r\nfrequent pulse; an eruption of rose-colored spots, occurring about the\r\nseventh or eighth day, slightly elevated above the surface,\r\ndisappearing under pressure, and coming out in successive crops, each\r\nspot lasting about three days; prostration not marked in the\r\nbeginning, but rapidly increasing; and occasionally deafness, sweats,\r\nand intestinal hemorrhages. When recovery takes place, the\r\nconvalescence is usually tedious, and may sometimes be protracted by\r\nthe occurrence of one or more relapses.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--The following are a few of the many names which have been\r\ngiven to the disease at different times. Most of them have ceased to\r\nbe applied to it, and only three or four of them are at present in\r\ngeneral use: Febris Mesenterica, 1696; Slow Nervous Fever, 1735;\r\nFebricula or Little Fever, 1740; Typhus Nervosus, 1760; Miliary Fever,\r\n1760; Typhus Mitior, 1769; Synochus, 1769; Common Continued Fever,\r\n1816; Gastro-Enterite, 1816; Entero-Mesenteric Fever, 1820; Abdominal\r\nand Darm Typhus, 1820; Typhus Fever of New England, 1824;\r\nDothienterie, 1826; Enterite-folliculeuse, 1835; Infantile Remittent\r\nFever, 1836; Enterite Septicémique, 1841; Mucous Fever, 1844; Enteric\r\nFever, 1846; Intestinal Fever, 1856; Ileo-Typhus, 1857; Pythogenic\r\nFever, 1858; Mountain Fever, 1870.\r\n\r\nNAME.--It has been objected to the name \"typhoid fever\" as a\r\ndesignation for this disease that it tends to perpetuate among the\r\nlaity the mistaken impression that typhoid fever is only a modified\r\ntyphus fever, and also that the word typhoid has been generally\r\napplied to a condition of system which is common to a great many\r\ndifferent diseases, {238} and which is not of necessity present in\r\nthis. In spite of these objections, and although it must be admitted\r\nthat they are not without force, I prefer to retain the name typhoid\r\nfever, and for the following reasons: 1st. It was the name given to\r\nthe disease by Louis, to whom we owe the first full and accurate\r\ndescription of it. 2d. It is the name by which it is best known to the\r\nprofession, not only in this country but abroad. 3d. No other name has\r\nbeen proposed for it which is not quite as much open to criticism.\r\nThus the term enteric fever, originally suggested by the late George\r\nB. Wood, and adopted by the London College of Physicians in its\r\n_Nomenclature of Diseases_, is objectionable because it brings into\r\nundue prominence the intestinal lesions and implies that they are the\r\ncause of the fever. The same objection may be urged against the name\r\n\"intestinal fever,\" proposed by Budd. The name \"pythogenic fever\"\r\nrests upon a theory of the disease which has never been proven, and is\r\nregarded by most observers as untenable. Under these circumstances\r\neven the influence of its distinguished proposer, the late Dr.\r\nMurchison, has been insufficient to secure its adoption by the\r\nprofession at large.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--Certain passages in the writings of Hippocrates have been\r\nappealed to by Murchison and other physicians in support of the\r\nopinion that typhoid fever was a disease of at least occasional\r\noccurrence in ancient times; but, although from the nature of its\r\ncauses it is probable that it has occurred in all ages and wherever\r\nmen have congregated in towns and villages, the descriptions given by\r\nthe Father of Medicine in the passages alluded to are not sufficiently\r\nfull to render it at all certain that typhoid fever had ever come\r\nunder his observation. Indeed, there is no author of an earlier date\r\nthan Spigelius[1] whose writings furnish any positive evidence that he\r\never met with the disease. Spigelius, however, in spite of the doubt\r\nthrown upon his observation by Hirsch,[2] would seem to have had\r\nopportunities for examining the bodies of those who had died of it,\r\nsince he gives an account of several autopsies, in which he says that\r\nthe small intestine was inflamed and that that part of it next to the\r\ncæcum and colon was frequently sphacelated. Panarolus[3] also says\r\nthat the intestines had the appearance of being cauterized\r\n(\"apparebant tanquam exusta\") in some cases observed by him in Rome a\r\nlittle later in the same century. Willis[4] would certainly appear to\r\nhave been familiar with two forms of fever, which, from the\r\ndescription he gives of them, could have been nothing else but typhoid\r\nand typhus fevers. Sydenham[5] also described a fever in which the\r\nprominent symptoms were diarrhoea, vomiting, delirium, a tendency to\r\ncoma, and epistaxis, and which was distinguishable from the febris\r\npestilens by the absence of a petechial eruption. Baglivi[6] of Rome\r\nin the latter part of the seventeenth century described the\r\nhæmitritæus of previous writers {239} under the title of febris\r\nmesenterica, and maintained that it was always accompanied by and\r\ndependent on inflammation of the intestines and enlargement of the\r\nmesenteric glands. A similar observation was made soon after by\r\nHoffmann,[7] and by Lancisi[8] in 1718. The latter seems to have fully\r\nrecognized the characteristics of the eruption, for he says that it\r\nconsisted of \"elevated papules which disappeared completely on\r\npressure.\" In 1759, Huxham described, under the title \"slow, nervous\r\nfever,\" a disease which there can be no doubt was typhoid fever. He\r\nmoreover pointed out very clearly the distinctions between this\r\ndisease and another to which he gave the name of \"putrid, malignant,\r\npetechial fever,\" and which was unquestionably typhus. Sir Richard\r\nManningham[9] also described typhoid fever under the title of\r\n\"febricula, or little fever.\" In the preface of his work he calls\r\nattention to its insidious origin, and to the fact that its gravity\r\nwas often underrated at its commencement, \"till, at length, more\r\nconspicuous and very terrible symptoms arise, and then the Physician\r\nis sent for in the greatest hurry, and happy for the Patient if the\r\nSymptoms, which are most obvious, do not, at this Time, mislead the\r\nPhysician to the Neglect of the little latent Fever, the true Cause of\r\nthese violent Symptoms.\" About the same time Morgagni[10] described\r\ncertain post-mortem examinations in which the lesions of the\r\nintestines were evidently those of typhoid fever. Other authors, whose\r\nworks bear evidence that they were familiar with the symptoms or\r\nlesions of typhoid fever, are Riedel, Roederer and Wagler, Stoll,\r\nRutty, Sarcone, Pepe, Fasano, Mayer, Wrenholt, Sutton, Bateman, Muir,\r\nEdmonstone, Prost, Petit and Serres, Cruveilhier, Lerminier, and\r\nAndral.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _De Febre Semitertiana_, Frankf., 1624; Op. Om.,\r\nAmsterdam, 1745. Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Handbuch der Historisch-Geographischen Pathologie_, von\r\nDr. August Hirsch, Stuttgart, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Observat. Med. Pentecostæ; Romæ_, 1652. Quoted by\r\nMurchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Dr. Willis's Practice of Physick_, translated by Samuel\r\nPordage, London, 1684.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _The Works of Thomas Sydenham, M.D., on Acute and Chronic\r\nDiseases_, with a Variety of Annotations by George Wallis, M.D.,\r\nLondon, 1788.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Opera Omnia Medico-practica et Anatomica_, Paris, 1788.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Opera Omnia Physico-Medico_, 1699. Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Opera Omnia_, Geneva, 1718.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _The Symptoms, Nature, etc. of the Febricula or Little\r\nFever_, London, 1746.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Quoted by Hirsch.]\r\n\r\nTo Bretonneau[11] of Tours appears to belong the credit of having\r\nfirst distinctly pointed out the association between certain symptoms\r\nand the lesions of the solitary and agminated glands of the ileum. He\r\nregarded the disease of the intestinal glands as inflammatory, and\r\ntherefore gave to it the name \"dothienenterie\" or \"dothienenterite\"\r\n(from [Greek: dothiên], a tumor, and [Greek: enteron], intestine),\r\nbut, unlike Prost, fully recognized the fact that there was no\r\nnecessary relation between the extent of the intestinal lesions and\r\nthe gravity of the febrile symptoms. Hirsch, however, claims this\r\nhonor for Pommer, whose little work on _Sporadic Typhus_ he thinks has\r\nnot received the consideration its merits deserve. Louis, to whom for\r\nhis careful study of typhoid fever we owe a large debt of gratitude,\r\nwas also fully aware of the lesions of the intestinal glands which\r\noccur in this disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Quoted by Trousseau, _Archives Générales_, 1826.]\r\n\r\nThe progress in pathology which observers were making was temporarily\r\nimpeded about this time by the fact that while typhoid fever was of\r\nfrequent occurrence in Paris, typhus fever was comparatively rarely\r\nmet with and had not been epidemic there for several years.\r\nBretonneau, Louis,[12] Chomel, and indeed the greater number of\r\ncontemporary French physicians, therefore fell into the error of\r\nsupposing that the fever which was then common in England was\r\nidentical with that which they were describing, while the English\r\nphysicians of the period, with but few {240} exceptions, contended\r\nwith equal strenuousness that there was but one form of continued\r\nfever, and that this was very seldom associated with disease of the\r\nintestines. In the second edition of his work Louis abandoned his\r\nformer opinion, and admitted that the typhus fever of the English was\r\na very different disease from that which formed the subject of his\r\ntreatise; but the confusion which existed in England in regard to this\r\ndisease was not completely dispelled until the appearance in 1849 and\r\nthe following two years of several papers on this subject by Sir\r\nWilliam Jenner,[13] in which it was conclusively demonstrated that\r\ntyphoid and typhus fevers were separate and distinct diseases. In\r\nGermany, however, the non-identity of these diseases was recognized as\r\nearly as 1810. Murchison says that the names by which they are still\r\ngenerally known in that country, typhus exanthematicus and typhus\r\nabdominalis, were given to them not long after.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Researches Anatomiques, Pathologiques et Therapeutiques\r\nsur la Maladie connue sur les Noms de gastro-entente, etc._, par P. C.\r\nA. Louis, Paris, 1829.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Med. Chir. Trans._, vol. xxxiii.; _Edinburgh Monthly\r\nJour. of Med. Sci._, vols. ix. and x., 1849-50; and _Med. Times_,\r\nvols. xx., xxi., xxii., xxxiii., 1849-51.]\r\n\r\nThe contributions made by American physicians to the knowledge of\r\ntyphoid fever have been both numerous and important. In 1824 it was\r\ndescribed by Nathan Smith[14] under the name of typhus fever of New\r\nEngland, and in 1833, E. Hale, Jr.,[15] of Boston, published in the\r\n_Medical Magazine_ for December an account of three dissections of\r\npersons considered by him to have died of the disease. In reference to\r\nthese cases, Bartlett[16] says that if the diagnosis could be looked\r\nupon as certain and positive they would constitute the first published\r\nexamples of intestinal lesion in New England. In February, 1835,\r\nWilliam S. Gerhard of Philadelphia, who was then under the impression\r\nthat the two diseases were identical, reported two cases under the\r\nname of typhus fever, the symptoms and post-mortem appearances of\r\nwhich he showed differed in no respect from those he had been\r\naccustomed to see in the cases of typhoid fever he had observed with\r\nLouis during his studies in Paris. The year after Gerhard had,\r\nhowever, the opportunity of observing an epidemic of true typhus\r\nfever, and was at once struck with the difference between the symptoms\r\nof the cases which then fell under his care and of those he had seen\r\nin Paris. In an admirable paper which appeared in the numbers of the\r\n_American Journal of the Medical Sciences_ for February and August,\r\n1837, he points out very clearly the differential diagnosis between\r\nthe two diseases. He particularly insisted on the marked difference\r\nbetween the petechial eruption of typhus and the rose-colored eruption\r\nof typhoid fever. He showed that the latter disease was invariably\r\nassociated with enlargement and ulceration of Peyer's patches and with\r\nenlargement of the mesenteric glands, and that these conditions were\r\nnever presented in the former. He also fully recognized the fact that\r\ntyphus fever was eminently contagious, while, on the other hand, he\r\nwas fully aware that typhoid fever was not contagious under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, \"although in some epidemics,\" he says, \"we have strong\r\nreason to believe it becomes so.\" The appearance of this paper marks\r\nan epoch in the history of typhoid fever. Murchison, when speaking of\r\nit, says that to Gerhard, and Pennock (who was associated with Gerhard\r\nin his observations) certainly {241} belongs the credit of first\r\nclearly establishing the most important points of distinction between\r\nthis disease and typhus fever, and M. Valleix alludes to it in terms\r\nequally complimentary. It is undoubtedly owing to it, more than to any\r\nother cause, that the differential diagnosis of these two diseases was\r\nperfectly understood by the great body of the profession in this\r\ncountry long before the question of the relation which they bore to\r\neach other was definitely settled in Great Britain,[17] or even in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14:  _Medical and Surgical Memoirs_, Baltimore, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Observations on the Typhoid Fever of New England_,\r\nBoston, 1839.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _The History, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the Fevers of\r\nthe United States_, 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The honor of having first clearly pointed out the\r\ndistinguishing characters of typhoid and typhus fevers has been\r\nrecently claimed for Sir William Jenner, but, as we have seen above,\r\nhis papers on this subject were not published until thirteen years\r\nafter that of Gerhard.]\r\n\r\nBartlett gave in the _Medical Magazine_, June, 1835, a short account\r\nof the entero-mesenteric alterations in five cases of unequivocal\r\ntyphoid fever, which alterations, he said, corresponded exactly to\r\nthose described by Louis. In the same year, James Jackson, Jr., of\r\nBoston, published an account of the intestinal lesions observed by him\r\nin cases during the years 1830, 1833, and 1834; and again in a _Report\r\nof Typhoid Fever_, communicated to the Massachusetts Medical Society\r\nin June, 1838, says that the alterations of Peyer's patches had been\r\nnoticed at the Massachusetts General Hospital previous to 1833 in\r\ncases which were carefully examined. In 1840, Shattuck of Boston\r\npublished in the _American Medical Examiner_ an account of some cases\r\nof typhoid and typhus fever which he had observed at the London Fever\r\nHospital during the previous year. In this paper, which had been\r\nalready communicated to the Medical Society of Observation of Paris,\r\nand which had unquestionably exerted a marked influence upon medical\r\nthought there, he pointed out very fully the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of each disease. In 1842, Dr. Bartlett issued the\r\nfirst edition of his work on _The History, Diagnosis, and Treatment of\r\nthe Fevers of the United States_, which contains very full\r\ndescriptions of both of these diseases, and of the means by which they\r\nmay be distinguished from each other. Since then there have been\r\nnumerous additions in this country to the literature of typhoid fever,\r\namong the most important of which may be mentioned the chapter on the\r\ndisease in the respective works on _The Practice of Medicine_ by\r\nProfessors Wood and Flint, the article on typho-malarial fever in the\r\n_Transactions_ of the International Medical Congress of 1876, and the\r\narticle in the work on _The Continued Fevers_, by James C. Wilson.\r\nAbroad, the medical press has been no less active. Within the last\r\ntwenty or thirty years Jaccoud and Trousseau in France, Liebermeister\r\nand Hirsch in Germany, and Tweedie and Cayley in England, have all\r\nmade important additions to our knowledge of the disease. To the late\r\nDr. Murchison[18] of London, however, is justly due the honor of\r\nhaving produced the best treatise on typhoid fever in any language,\r\nand the writer cheerfully acknowledges that he has drawn largely upon\r\nit for the material of the present article.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _A Treatise on Continued Fevers_, London, 1873.]\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--Although it will be generally admitted\r\nthat the conditions of civilization favor the occurrence and extension\r\nof typhoid fever, yet there is abundant evidence that they are not\r\nabsolutely necessary to its production, as there is no country,\r\nwhether civilized or not, of the diseases of which we have any\r\nknowledge, in which it has not occasionally made its appearance, being\r\nmet with in every variety of climate. It is endemic in North America,\r\nattacking alike the inhabitants {242} of Greenland and British America\r\nand those of Mexico. In our own country it prevails from time to time\r\nin every State of the Union, committing its ravages as well among the\r\nrocks and hills of New England as in the more fertile valleys of the\r\nWest and South. In many of the newly-settled portions of our country\r\nmalarial fevers are, as is well known, exceedingly rife. In\r\nproportion, however, as towns and cities spring up, and as the land is\r\nproperly drained, they diminish in frequency, and are gradually\r\nreplaced, to a certain extent at least, by typhoid fever; but the\r\ninfluences which produced them retain for a long time enough of power\r\nto stamp their impress upon all other diseases. In large portions of\r\nthe Western and Southern States typhoid fever is therefore rarely\r\nuncomplicated, and is much more likely to assume the form which will\r\nbe fully described later as typho-malarial fever.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever has also occurred frequently in Central America and the\r\nWest India Islands. It has prevailed from time to time in the states\r\nof South America, and occasionally assumed in some of them--as, for\r\ninstance, Brazil and Chili--an epidemic form.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever is endemic in the British Isles, but, according to\r\nMurchison, is most common in England, more common in Ireland than in\r\nScotland, and in Scotland more common on the west than on the east\r\ncoast. It also exists as an endemic disease in every country of the\r\ncontinent of Europe, from Sweden and Norway on the north to Turkey on\r\nthe south, and in some of them--as, for instance, France and\r\nGermany--would seem to be of much more frequent occurrence than in\r\nthis country, or even in England. Medical literature is also not\r\ndeficient in evidence that it has prevailed at various times in all\r\nthe different countries of Asia and Africa and in Australia. Morehead\r\nasserted in the first edition of his _Clinical Researches on Diseases\r\nin India_ that India enjoyed an absolute immunity from typhoid fever,\r\nbut in the second edition of this work he acknowledged that a larger\r\nexperience had led him to change his opinion on this point. Moreover,\r\nthe writings of Annesley, Twining, and other Indian authors furnish\r\nconvincing proof that the disease is by no means unknown in that\r\ncountry. Indeed, even the relative immunity from it which it has been\r\nclaimed that tropical and subtropical countries possess has been\r\nfound, upon a fuller study of the diseases of these countries, not to\r\nexist to anything like the degree that was formerly supposed.\r\n\r\nThe occasional occurrence of typhoid fever in islands separated from\r\nthe main land by a considerable distance--as, for instance, the island\r\nof Norfolk,[19] which is situated in the Pacific Ocean four hundred\r\nmiles west of South America--is an interesting fact, and one which,\r\nwith the present limits to our knowledge on the subject, it is\r\nimpossible to explain satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Metcalfe, _Brit. Med. Jour._, Nov., 1880.]\r\n\r\nThe ETIOLOGY of typhoid fever may be considered under the heads of--1,\r\npredisposing, 2, exciting causes.\r\n\r\n1. PREDISPOSING CAUSES.--All observers agree that the predisposition\r\nto typhoid fever is greater in childhood and early adult life than\r\nafter thirty years of age. Thus, Murchison states that during\r\ntwenty-three years nearly one-half the admissions to the London Fever\r\nHospital were of patients between fifteen and twenty-five years of\r\nage, and that in more than a fourth, the patients were under fifteen\r\nyears. On the other hand, {243} in less than a seventh were they over\r\nthirty, and in only one in seventy-one did their ages exceed fifty.\r\nTaking these facts in connection with the circumstance that the entire\r\npopulation of England and Wales in 1861 was 12,481,323 persons under\r\nthirty years of age and 7,584,901 above thirty, it follows, he says,\r\nthat persons under thirty are more than four times as liable to\r\nenteric fever as persons over thirty. Jackson found that the average\r\nage of the patients in two hundred and ninety-one cases observed at\r\nthe Massachusetts General Hospital was a little over twenty-two years,\r\nthe average age in the fatal cases being somewhat greater than in\r\nthose in which recovery took place. Liebermeister, from an analysis of\r\na large number of cases treated at the hospital in Basle, has arrived\r\nat the same conclusion. No age, however, enjoys a complete immunity\r\nfrom the disease. Manzini[20] has recorded a case in which lesions of\r\nPeyer's patches similar to those of typhoid fever were found in a\r\nseventh-month foetus which died within half an hour after its birth.\r\nCases are also on record in which death has occurred from this disease\r\nin the first few weeks of life. I have myself observed several cases\r\nin young children at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. The\r\nprobability is, that it is of even more frequent occurrence in\r\nchildren than is generally supposed, as this class of patients is not\r\noften admitted into general hospitals, and as from the absence of some\r\nof its characteristic symptoms when it occurs in the very young the\r\nnature of the disease is often unrecognized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the disease occurs not infrequently in advanced\r\nlife: 83 cases out of 5911 were observed at the London Fever Hospital\r\nin persons over fifty, 27 in persons over sixty, and in 2 the age was\r\nseventy-five. In a case recorded by D'Arcy the age of the patient was\r\neighty-six, and in one reported by Hamernyk it was ninety.[21]\r\nBartlett long ago contended that the disease was not so rare as was\r\ngenerally supposed among people over forty years of age; and there is\r\nreally no good reason to believe that the susceptibility to the causes\r\nof the disease in an unprotected person diminishes with advancing\r\nyears, the immunity from this disease which elderly people appear to\r\nenjoy being probably due to the fact that, as the disease is not\r\nuncommon in early life, they are in many instances protected by having\r\nalready passed through an attack.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nThe mean age of the male patients treated at the London Fever Hospital\r\nwas slightly in excess of that of the female, but in the cases\r\nanalyzed by Jackson the reverse of this was observed.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of all general hospitals, with very few exceptions,\r\nshow a greater or less preponderance of males over females among the\r\ntyphoid fever patients treated in them. According to Murchison, of\r\n5988 cases admitted into the London Fever Hospital during twenty-three\r\nyears, 3001 were males and 2987 were females. Of 891 cases admitted\r\ninto the Glasgow Infirmary during twelve years, 527 were males and 364\r\nfemales. Liebermeister states that 1297 male typhoid patients and 751\r\nfemale were treated in the hospital at Basle from 1865 to 1870.\r\nOccasionally, the difference is even greater than is indicated by\r\nthese figures. Thus, of 138 cases observed by Louis, all but 32\r\noccurred in males. When, however, we consider that the proportion of\r\nmen who apply for admission to hospitals when sick is much larger than\r\nthat of women, we should hesitate before accepting these statistics as\r\nproof that the former {244} are more liable to be attacked by typhoid\r\nfever than the latter. Indeed, the opinion which Murchison expresses\r\nis generally accepted as correct by authors, that neither sex is more\r\nlikely than the other to contract the disease. Liebermeister asserts\r\nthat pregnant and puerperal women and those who are nursing infants\r\nenjoy a relative immunity. On the other hand, Nathan Smith says that\r\nwhile the sexes are equally liable to it, more women are cut off by it\r\nthan men, in consequence of its appearance during pregnancy or soon\r\nafter parturition.\r\n\r\nIt was long ago pointed out by certain French observers that newcomers\r\nare much more liable to be attacked by typhoid fever than persons who\r\nhave lived for some time in an infected locality. In 129 cases\r\nexamined with reference to this point by Louis, the patients in 73 had\r\nnot resided in Paris more than ten months, and in 102 not more than\r\ntwenty months. Bartlett noticed that during an epidemic in Lowell\r\nwhich he had the opportunity of observing the disease attacked the\r\nrecent residents in much larger proportion than the old. Liebermeister\r\nalso calls attention to this peculiarity of the disease. Murchison's\r\nexperience in reference to this point has been somewhat similar, for\r\nhe found upon examination of the records of the London Fever Hospital\r\nthat 21.84 per cent. of the patients admitted there for typhoid fever\r\nhad been residents of London for less than two years. Almost all of\r\nthese patients came, he says, from the provinces of England, and were\r\nin good health and comfortable circumstances at the date of their\r\narrival in London and for some time after. Moreover, a large\r\nproportion of them were first attacked within a few weeks after\r\nchanging their residence from one part of London to another. He also\r\nrefers to instances in which successive visitors at the same house at\r\nintervals of months, or even years, have been seized shortly after\r\ntheir arrival with typhoid fever or with diarrhoea, from which the\r\nordinary occupants were exempt. These facts indicate with sufficient\r\nclearness that habitual exposure to the causes of the disease confers,\r\nto a certain extent at least, an immunity from their effects, just as\r\nit does in the various forms of disease arising from malaria. It is\r\nnot unlikely, as has been suggested by Wilson,[22] that one of the\r\ncauses of the frequency of typhoid fever in the early autumn in our\r\nAmerican cities among well-to-do people is to be formed in the\r\ncircumstance that during an absence of two months or more in the\r\nmountains or by the sea they have to some extent lost the immunity\r\nacquired by habitual exposure to sewer emanations, and return to the\r\natmosphere of the city unprotected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The occurrence of typhoid fever in the early fall among\r\npersons who have spent the summer out of town is, however, susceptible\r\nof another explanation. In many instances they have returned to houses\r\nwhich have been not only unoccupied, but closed, during several\r\nmonths, and which, in consequence of the more or less complete\r\nevaporation of the water in the traps of the drain-pipes, have been\r\nthoroughly permeated by sewer gas.]\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that any particular occupation acts as a\r\npredisposing cause of typhoid fever. Among the 621 patients treated at\r\nthe Pennsylvania Hospital during the last ten years, were\r\nrepresentatives of every branch of industry, and the same fact has\r\nbeen observed at every general hospital, not only in this country, but\r\nabroad. There is also no reason to believe that the station in life of\r\nitself exerts much influence in predisposing to the disease. The rich\r\nsuffer equally with the poor. It would appear, indeed, that since the\r\nrecent general introduction of ill-ventilated water-closets and\r\nstationary washstands into the houses of the {245} better classes the\r\nliability of the former to suffer from the disease is greater than\r\nthat of the latter.\r\n\r\nPersons recovering from an illness or in an infirm condition of health\r\ndo not appear to be more liable than others to be attacked by typhoid\r\nfever. Among the many patients who have fallen under my care only a\r\nvery few were in ill-health at the time of their seizure. The same\r\nfact has been noticed by Murchison and other observers. Indeed,\r\nLiebermeister goes so far as to say that typhoid fever attacks by\r\npreference strong and healthy persons, while it avoids those suffering\r\nwith chronic ailments. That this latter class of patients enjoys no\r\nimmunity from the disease when exposed to its causes is shown by a\r\nfact which he himself records. During his service at the hospital at\r\nBasle from 1865 to 1871 several of the patients in the medical and\r\nsurgical wards were attacked by typhoid fever, the cases being\r\nespecially numerous in two rooms which were situated one directly over\r\nthe other. Upon investigation it was found that a wooden pipe which\r\nextended from the sewer to the roof ran by both of these rooms. The\r\nsewer at the point where this pipe ran into it was of faulty\r\nconstruction, and was turned at a right angle, so that the refuse\r\nmatter collected there. Since this source of infection was made known\r\nrepeated cleansings, washings, and disinfections have been followed by\r\nsatisfactory improvement, and Liebermeister believes that if the sewer\r\nwere entirely altered the infection would disappear.\r\n\r\nIt would seem only natural that intemperance, by diminishing the\r\npowers of resistance in the individual, would increase his liability\r\nto contract typhoid fever, but there is no proof that it does so. Few\r\nof the patients who have come under my care were intemperate, and\r\nstill fewer were broken down by this cause. There is also no evidence\r\nthat grief, fear, or any other depressing emotion is a predisposing\r\ncause of the disease, and the same may be said of bodily fatigue and\r\novercrowding. On the other hand, much importance has been attached by\r\nwriters to idiosyncrasy as a predisposing cause of typhoid fever. What\r\nthe peculiarities of constitution are which increase the liability to\r\nthe disease are not definitely known, but there can be no question\r\nthat it occurs much more frequently, and is much more fatal, in some\r\nfamilies than in others.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever occurs with the greatest frequency in this country, as\r\nit does with very few exceptions elsewhere, during the latter half of\r\nsummer and the early part of autumn. Indeed, its greater prevalence at\r\nthis season than at other times has given to it the name of \"autumnal\"\r\nand \"fall fever,\" by which it is popularly known in many sections of\r\nthis country as well as of England. On the other hand, the disease is\r\nusually at its minimum in May and June. The number of cases, however,\r\ndoes not usually immediately diminish upon the onset of cold weather.\r\nOn the contrary, R. D. Cleemann,[23] from a comparison of the\r\nmortality returns of Philadelphia for a period of ten years, observed\r\nthat after diminishing in November they not infrequently underwent a\r\nmarked increase in December. Of 621 cases treated at the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital during the last ten years, 89 were admitted during spring,\r\n259 during summer, 182 during autumn, and 91 during winter. Of 5988\r\ncases treated at the London Fever Hospital,[24] 759 were admitted in\r\nthe {246} spring, 1490 in summer, 2461 in autumn, and 1278 in winter.\r\nOf the whole number, 27.7 per cent. were admitted in the two months of\r\nOctober and November, and in April and May only 7.3 per cent.\r\nHirsch[25] has published statistics which do not differ materially\r\nfrom these. He also mentions the interesting fact that in Rio Janeiro\r\nthe maximum of the disease occurs in the months from March to June,\r\nor, in other words, in the season which in that latitude corresponds\r\nto our autumn. There are, however, some exceptions to the general rule\r\nof the greater prevalence of the disease during the autumn. Bartlett,\r\nwho was aware of its greater frequency at that time, refers to an\r\nextensive and fatal epidemic which occurred in the city of Lowell in\r\nMassachusetts during the winter and early spring; and similar\r\nvisitations have been observed in other places.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Transactions of the College of Physicians of\r\nPhiladelphia_, 3d S. vol. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Murchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Handbuch der Historisch-Geographischen Pathologie_,\r\nStuttgart, 1881.]\r\n\r\nMost authors agree with the statement made by Murchison, that typhoid\r\nfever is unusually prevalent after summers remarkable for their\r\ndryness and high temperature, and that it is unusually rare in summers\r\nand autumns which are wet and cold. Certainly, the severest epidemic\r\nof the disease which has been observed in Philadelphia in several\r\nyears occurred in the year 1876, during and after a summer of\r\nexceptionally high temperature, and one characterized by a decidedly\r\ndiminished rainfall. Still, there can be no question that the\r\nincreased prevalence of the disease at this time was due, in part at\r\nleast, to the crowded condition of the city consequent upon the\r\nCentennial Exhibition. In 1872, although the mean of the summer\r\ntemperature was slightly higher than that of 1876, the disease did not\r\nprevail in an epidemic form. This may be explained by the fact that\r\nthe rainfall of the summer months of this year was decidedly greater\r\nthan the average. Hirsch, however, attaches much less importance to\r\ntemperature as a factor in the production of typhoid fever than most\r\nother authors. He says that he has found, from a comparison of a large\r\nnumber of epidemics, that the disease occurs almost as often in cool\r\nas in hot summers, in cold as in warm autumns, and in mild as in\r\nsevere winters. Murchison, moreover, admits that mere dryness of the\r\natmosphere is not conducive to an increase of typhoid fever. On the\r\ncontrary, he says, warm, damp weather, when drains are most offensive,\r\nis often followed by an outbreak of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe relation which temperature and moisture bear to the causation of\r\ntyphoid fever is therefore not definitely ascertained. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the largest number of cases does not occur at the period\r\nof the greatest heat, but is usually not observed until from six weeks\r\nto two months afterward, and the minimum is not reached until about\r\nthe same length of time after that of the most intense cold. This\r\ndifference in time Murchison explains by the hypothesis that the cause\r\nof the disease is exaggerated or only called into action by the\r\nprotracted heat of summer and autumn, and that it requires the\r\nprotracted cold of winter and spring to impair its activity or to\r\ndestroy it. On the other hand, Liebermeister, who believes that the\r\nbreeding-places of typhoid fever lie deep in the earth, holds that the\r\ntime is consumed in the penetration of the changes of temperature to\r\nthe place where the typhoid poison is elaborated, in the development\r\nof the poison without the human body, and in the period of incubation.\r\nIn some places the maximum of the disease is observed earlier in the\r\nyear than in others. In Berlin, for {247} instance, the largest number\r\nof fatal cases occurs in October, while in Munich it does not occur\r\nuntil February. This depends, he thinks, upon the difference in the\r\ndistance beneath the earth's surface of these breeding-places in\r\ndifferent localities, and the deeper they are the longer, he says,\r\nwill it be before they are affected by the heat of summer or the cold\r\nof winter, since the changes of the temperature of the air are\r\nfollowed by corresponding changes in the temperature of the earth more\r\nand more slowly the deeper we go beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nBuhl and Pettenkofer have, as the result of a series of observations\r\ncarried on in Munich over a number of years, reached the conclusion\r\nthat an intimate relation exists between the variations in the degree\r\nof prevalence of typhoid fever and the rise and fall of water in the\r\nsoil. When the springs were low they found that there was a marked\r\nincrease in the number of cases; when, on the other hand, they were\r\nhigh, there was just as decided a diminution. Out of this fact they\r\nhave evolved the theory that the cause of typhoid fever lies deep in\r\nthe soil, and has the power of multiplying itself there, and that this\r\nproperty is very much increased when the water-level sinks, and the\r\nupper layers of the earth are consequently exposed to the air. It is,\r\non the contrary, diminished when the water-level rises and the earth\r\nis again saturated with moisture. It is unquestionably true, as has\r\nalready been stated, that it is principally after hot and dry weather,\r\nwhen the springs are of course low, that typhoid fever is most\r\nprevalent, and that it very frequently subsides after the occurrence\r\nof very heavy rains; but it is not necessary to adopt the theory of\r\nBuhl and Pettenkofer to explain these facts. It seems quite as\r\nprobable that the increased prevalence of the disease after dry\r\nweather is due, as suggested by Buchanan and Liebermeister, to the\r\ngreater amount of solid matter which is then suspended in the water of\r\nthe springs. A larger proportion of the germs of the disease, if there\r\nshould be any present in the soil, will therefore be contained in any\r\ngiven quantity of the drinking-water. The theory fails to account, as\r\npointed out by Murchison, for the connection which is frequently\r\nobserved between defective house-drainage and outbreaks of typhoid\r\nfever, occurring irrespectively of any variations in the subsoil\r\nwater. And, moreover, outbreaks of the disease have occurred under\r\nprecisely opposite circumstances, as the outbreak at Terling in 1867,\r\nrecorded by Thorne,[26] which was coincident with a rise in the\r\nsubsoil water after drought.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nIt is believed in many parts of our country that there is an\r\nantagonism between typhoid fever and the various forms of malarial\r\nfever, and it is unquestionably true that in many districts in which\r\nthe latter were formerly prevalent they have ceased to be frequent,\r\nand have been replaced apparently by the former. In the cultivation of\r\nthe soil the causes of malarial fever disappear, or at least become\r\nless potent. On the other hand, the increase of population and the\r\nneglect of all sanitary laws in the building of towns, and the\r\nconstruction of sewers with their house connections, seem to favor the\r\noccurrence of typhoid fever. But there is no real antagonism between\r\nthe diseases. During the recent Civil War typhoid fever was not\r\ninfrequently developed in soldiers suffering from malarial disease.\r\nIndeed, so frequent was it to have the manifestations of the two\r\ndiseases in the same individual that many observers at that {248} time\r\nsupposed they had a new disease to deal with, to which they gave the\r\nname of typho-malarial fever.\r\n\r\n2. EXCITING CAUSES.--Much diversity of opinion has existed in times\r\npast and to a certain extent continues to exist, in regard to the\r\ncontagiousness of typhoid fever. In the early part of this century\r\nthere was quite a number of good observers, including Nathan Smith in\r\nthis country, and Bretonneau and Gendron of Château du Loir in France,\r\nwho held the opinion it was an eminently contagious disease. Indeed,\r\nSmith went so far as to say that its contagiousness was as fully\r\ndemonstrated as that of measles, small-pox, or any other disease\r\nuniversally admitted to be contagious. This was also the opinion of\r\nWilliam Budd, who maintained that the contagious nature of typhoid\r\nfever was the master truth in its history. The late Sir Thomas Watson\r\nwas also a warm supporter of the same view. At the present time,\r\nhowever, the large majority of physicians, whose opportunities for\r\nobservation give weight to their opinions, do not regard the disease\r\nas contagious in the strict sense of the word. During the past\r\ntwenty-four years I have been almost uninterruptedly connected with\r\nlarge general hospitals, and during that time have had a large number\r\nof cases of typhoid fever under my care, and a still larger number\r\nmore or less under my observation. During all this time I have never\r\nknown but one case to originate within a hospital, and that occurred\r\nin a servant whose duties did not bring her in immediate contact with\r\nthe sick. Murchison's experience with a much larger number of cases\r\nhas been very similar. In twenty-three years, in which 5988 cases were\r\ntreated in the London Fever Hospital, only 17 residents contracted the\r\ndisease, and most of these had no personal contact with the sick.\r\nLiebermeister asserts that he has never known a case to originate in a\r\nhospital from direct contagion. When such cases appeared to have\r\noccurred, they could generally be traced, he says, to some defective\r\nsanitary condition of the hospital.\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, many facts on record which, unless duly\r\nweighed, appear to lend a good deal of support to the theory of the\r\ncontagiousness of typhoid fever. Among the most important of these are\r\n(1) the occurrence in rapid succession of several cases in the same\r\nhouse, and (2) the limited epidemics which occasionally follow the\r\narrival of an infected person into a previously healthy locality.\r\nThese facts are, however, susceptible of an entirely different\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n1. In those instances in which several cases of the disease have\r\noccurred in the same house, it not infrequently happens that some\r\ndefect in its sanitary conditions is detected, or that the\r\ndrinking-water is found to be impure. The same cause which produced\r\nthe first case may, therefore, also have produced those which\r\nsucceeded it. Indeed, the interval between the cases is sometimes so\r\nshort that for this reason alone, if there were no other, they could\r\nscarcely be attributed to contagion. It not infrequently happens that\r\nthe seizure of one member of a large family is followed on the next\r\nday by that of another, and on the third or fourth by that of still\r\nanother. Now, while it is undoubtedly true that the period of\r\nincubation has appeared in some cases to be very short, we know that\r\nunder ordinary circumstances it is usually about two weeks.\r\n\r\n2. The explanation of the second fact is not more difficult, but in\r\norder that it may be clear to the reader it will be well to give in\r\ndetail a few {249} of the instances on record in which the arrival of\r\nan individual sick with typhoid fever in a previously healthy locality\r\nhas been followed by an outbreak of the disease. Nathan Smith refers\r\nto two cases of this character. In both of these the disease appeared\r\nto be communicated to several individuals by patients who had\r\ncontracted the disease elsewhere. So little is said in the reports of\r\nthese cases of the water-supply of the localities in which they\r\noccurred, or of the manner of disposing of the discharges of the\r\npatients, that they would scarcely now be used as arguments in favor\r\nof the contagiousness of the disease. The report of a local epidemic\r\nby Austin Flint, Sr., is more satisfactory in this respect, and is as\r\nfollows: A stranger was detained in a small village near Buffalo by an\r\nillness which proved fatal in the course of a few days, and which was\r\nrecognized as typhoid fever by his attending physicians. Up to this\r\ntime, it is stated, typhoid fever had never been known in the\r\nneighborhood. In the course of a month more than one-half of the\r\npopulation, numbering forty-three, was attacked by the disease, and\r\nten had died. The family of the tavern-keeper at whose house the\r\nstranger lodged was the first to suffer, and of the families\r\nimmediately surrounding the tavern but one wholly escaped, that of a\r\nman named Stearns. Upon investigation, it was ascertained that this\r\nfamily alone, of all these families, did not use the well belonging to\r\nthe tavern, but had its own water-supply. The occurrence of the\r\ndisease naturally produced great excitement, and Stearns, between whom\r\nand the tavern-keeper a quarrel existed, was suspected of having\r\npoisoned the well; but an examination of the water showed this\r\nsuspicion to be unfounded. There can, however, be little doubt that\r\nthe water of the well, which was in all probability contaminated by\r\nthe discharges of the stranger, was the means of propagating the\r\ndisease; for although it is said that the family of Stearns was cut\r\noff by the quarrel from all intercourse with that of the\r\ntavern-keeper--a fact upon which some stress is laid by Flint--it does\r\nnot appear that a similar isolation existed as regards the other\r\nfamilies affected.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice of Medicine_,\r\nby Austin Flint, M.D., Philadelphia, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the arrival of a sick person may cause the\r\ndissemination of the disease in a previously healthy community is even\r\nbetter shown by the following histories of local outbreaks:[28]\r\n\r\n\"The water-supply pipes of the town of Over Darwen were leaky, and the\r\nsoil through which they passed was soaked at one spot by the sewage of\r\na particular house. No harm resulted till a young lady suffering from\r\ntyphoid fever was brought to this house from a distant place. Within\r\nthree weeks of her arrival the disease broke out and 1500 persons were\r\nattacked. At Nunney a number of houses received their water-supply\r\nfrom a foul brook contaminated by the leakage of a cesspool of one of\r\nthe houses, but no fever showed itself till a man ill with typhoid\r\ncame from a distance to this house. In about fourteen days an outbreak\r\nof fever took place in all the houses.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Wm. Cayley, M.D., _Brit. Med. Jour._, March 15, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThere are many other observations which seem to render it certain that\r\nthe alvine dejections are a most important medium by which typhoid\r\nfever is communicated to others; and yet there is no evidence that\r\nthey possess this power in a fresh condition. They have been\r\nrepeatedly examined, and even handled, with impunity, and, as has\r\nalready been stated, it {250} is rare for the disease to be imparted\r\nto the immediate attendants upon the sick, or in a well-ventilated\r\nhospital to the other patients in the same ward, provided that the\r\ndischarges are disinfected and removed immediately after being passed,\r\nand the bed-linen and clothes of the patient changed whenever they are\r\nsoiled. The feces must therefore undergo some changes before they\r\nbecome possessed of virulent properties. This appears to be shown\r\nconclusively by the following facts: (1) laundresses who wash the\r\nsoiled clothes of typhoid fever patients not infrequently contract the\r\ndisease; (2) the occupants of houses connected by ill-trapped drains\r\nwith sewers into which the discharges of such patients have found\r\ntheir way often suffer severely from the disease; and (3) the use of\r\nwater polluted by such discharges is, as has already been shown,\r\nalmost certain to induce the disease in persons not protected by a\r\nprevious attack.\r\n\r\nThe following histories of outbreaks of typhoid fever will show\r\nclearly how the dejections of patients may be the means of propagating\r\nthe disease to others:\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE CASES--Lausen[29] is a village lying on the railway\r\nbetween Basle and Olten shortly before coming to the great Hauenstein\r\nTunnel. It is situated in the Jura, in the valley of the Ergolz, and\r\nconsists of 103 houses with 819 inhabitants. It was remarkably\r\nhealthy, and resorted to on that account as a place of summer\r\nresidence. With the exception of six houses it is supplied with water\r\nby a spring with two heads which rises above the village at the\r\nsouthern foot of a mountain called the Stockhalder, composed of\r\noolite. The water is received into a well built covered reservoir, and\r\nis distributed by wooden pipes to four public fountains, whence it was\r\ndrawn by the inhabitants. Six houses had an independent supply--five\r\nfrom wells, one from the mill-dam of a paper-factory. On August 7,\r\n1872, ten inhabitants of Lausen, living in different houses, were\r\nseized by typhoid fever, and during the next nine days fifty-seven\r\ncases occurred, the only houses escaping being those six which were\r\nnot supplied by the public fountains. The disease continued to spread,\r\nand in all 130 persons were attacked, and several children who had\r\nbeen sent to Lausen for the benefit of the fresh air fell ill after\r\ntheir return home. A careful investigation was made into the causes of\r\nthis epidemic, and a complete explanation was given. Separated from\r\nthe valley of the Ergolz, in which Lausen lies, by the Stockhalder,\r\nthe mountain at the foot of which the spring supplying Lausen rises,\r\nis a side valley called the Furjust, traversed by a stream, the\r\nFurlenbach, which joins the Ergolz just below Lausen, the Stockhalder\r\noccupying the fork of the valley. The Furlenthal contains six\r\nfarm-houses, which were supplied with drinking-water, not from the\r\nFurlenbach, but by a spring rising on the opposite side of the valley\r\nto the Stockhalder. Now, there was reason to believe that under\r\ncertain circumstances water from the Furlenbach found its way under\r\nthe Stockhalder into one of the heads of the fountain supplying\r\nLausen. It was noticed that when the meadows on one side of the\r\nFurlenbach were irrigated, which was done periodically, the flow of\r\nwater into the Lausen spring was increased, rendering it probable that\r\nthe irrigation water percolated through the superficial strata and\r\nfound its way under the Stockhalder by subterranean channels in the\r\nlimestone rock. Moreover, some years before a {251} hole on one\r\noccasion formed close to the Furlenbach by the sinking in of the\r\nsuperficial strata, and the stream became diverted into it and\r\ndisappeared, while shortly afterward the spring of Lausen began to\r\nflow much more abundantly. The hole was filled up, and the Furlenbach\r\nresumed its usual course. The Furlenbach was unquestionably\r\ncontaminated by the privies of the adjacent farm-houses; the soil-pits\r\ncommunicated with it. Thus, from time immemorial, whenever the meadows\r\nof the Furlenthal were irrigated the contaminated water of the\r\nFurlenbach, after percolation through the superficial strata and a\r\nlong underground course, helped to feed one of the two heads of the\r\nfountain supplying Lausen. The natural filtration, however, which it\r\nunderwent rendered it perfectly bright and clear, and chemical\r\nexamination showed it to be remarkably free from organic impurities,\r\nand Lausen was extremely healthy and free from fever. On June 10th one\r\nof the peasants of the Furlenthal fell ill with typhoid fever, the\r\nsource of which was not clearly made out, and passed through a severe\r\nattack with relapses, so that he remained ill all summer; and on July\r\n10th a girl in the same house, and in August a boy, were attacked.\r\nTheir dejections were certainly, in part, thrown into the Furlenbach;\r\nand, moreover, the soil-pit of the privy communicated with the brook.\r\nIn the middle of July the meadows of the Furlenthal were irrigated as\r\nusual for the hay crop, and within three weeks this was followed by\r\nthe outbreak at Lausen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: William Cayley, M.D., _British Medical Journal_, Mar.\r\n15, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate the connection between the water-supply of\r\nLausen and the Furlenbach, the following experiments were performed.\r\nThe hole mentioned above as having on one occasion diverted the\r\nFurlenbach into the presumed subterranean channels under the\r\nStockhalder was cleared out, and 18 cwt. of salt were dissolved in\r\nwater and poured in, and the stream again diverted into it. The next\r\nday salt was found in the spring at Lausen. Fifty pounds of wheat\r\nflour were then poured into the hole, and the Furlenbach again\r\ndiverted into it, but the spring at Lausen remained clear, and no\r\nreaction of starch could be obtained, showing that the water must have\r\nfound its way under the Stockhalder, in part by percolation through\r\nthe porous strata, and not by distinct channels.\r\n\r\nVolz[30] refers to an epidemic which occurred at Gerlachsheim, a\r\nvillage of Germany, some years ago, in which, in the course of three\r\nweeks, 52 persons residing on one of the principal streets were\r\nattacked by the disease. It was found, upon investigation, that they\r\nall got their water from a well which was polluted by the stools of\r\nthe first patient. A. Pasteur[31] reports an epidemic caused by the\r\ncontamination of a well by typhoid dejections, and which ceased when\r\nthe use of the water was discontinued. Niericker[32] also reports an\r\noutbreak which was found to be due to a similar pollution of the\r\ndrinking-water, and which likewise ceased when the water-supply was\r\nderived from another source.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Schmidt's Jahrbuch_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Revue méd. de la Suisse_, Mars 15, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Schweiz. Corr. Bl._, ix. 1, 1879.]\r\n\r\nAn outbreak of the disease which occurred in a farm-house situated\r\nabout eight miles from the city of Philadelphia came under my own\r\nobservation. The first case occurred in a young girl of sixteen, who,\r\nwith the exception of an occasional visit to the city, had not been\r\naway from her own home for several months before she was {252} taken\r\nill. The disease ran in her a severe course, and eventually terminated\r\nfatally. About three weeks afterward four other members of the family\r\nwere attacked, one of whom died. Two other persons, living in a house\r\non the opposite side of the road, but who were in the habit of\r\ndrinking water from the same well, also took the disease. There was no\r\nother case of typhoid fever in the immediate vicinity, nor had there\r\nbeen for some time. The farm-house is situated in a cup-shaped\r\ndepression, so that water flowed toward it from all directions. The\r\ncellar was constantly filled with water during the winter, and just\r\nbefore the outbreak had contained not only an unusually large\r\nquantity, but also a large amount of decaying vegetable matter. The\r\nwell from which the family drew their drinking-water is situated\r\nwithin a few feet of the kitchen door, and at some distance from the\r\ncesspool used by the family, so that there was no reason to believe\r\nthat there was any communication between the two. The wall of the well\r\nwas found to be very much loosened by the roots of two trees growing\r\nin the immediate vicinity. As the ground was also very much cut up by\r\nthe burrows of rats, the water used for the various household\r\npurposes, and which was habitually thrown into a gutter which ran past\r\nthe well, found a ready access to it. There would seem to be but\r\nlittle doubt that the first patient contracted the disease in some way\r\nduring her visits to the city, and that the disease in the other\r\npatients arose from their drinking the water of the well which had\r\nbeen polluted by that used in washing her soiled linen.\r\n\r\nBallard[33] has shown very clearly that milk may also be a medium of\r\ncommunication of the disease. He found that an epidemic which occurred\r\nin the parish of Islington, London, in 1871 was (1) almost entirely\r\nconfined to a district comprised within a circle having a radius of\r\nnot more than a quarter of a mile; (2) that out of 62 families living\r\nwithin this district, who were known to have suffered from typhoid\r\nfever, 54 were constantly supplied with milk from a particular dairy,\r\nand it was satisfactorily proved that at least three of the remaining\r\neight had occasionally partaken from the same source; and (3) that out\r\nof 142 families, comprising all the customers of this dairy, and\r\nliving not only within the district above specified, but in other\r\nparts of the parish, 70, or very nearly one-half, were invaded by\r\ntyphoid fever within the ten weeks during which the outbreak lasted.\r\nUpon a visit to the farm from which the milk came it was ascertained\r\nthat a member of the dairyman's family had been ill with typhoid\r\nfever, and that the water of the well which supplied the family with\r\ndrinking-water had been polluted by his discharges. Although the\r\ndairyman denied that this water had ever been mixed with the milk, he\r\nadmitted that it had been used to wash the milk-pans. Murchison was\r\nalso able, in an outbreak which occurred in another district of\r\nLondon, to trace the disease to the same source.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _On a Localized Outbreak of Typhoid Fever in Islington_,\r\nLondon, 1871.]\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever may be likewise propagated in consequence of the\r\ncontamination of the atmosphere by the typhoid poison. This may be the\r\nresult of allowing the undisinfected stools, or linen soiled by them,\r\nto remain for some time exposed to the air, or may arise from\r\npollution {253} of the soil from the same cause or from defective\r\nsewage. Hermann Schmidt[34] refers to several epidemics breaking out\r\nin garrisons which he believed to be due to pollution of the soil. In\r\nthe citadel of Wurzburg typhoid fever occurred through several years,\r\nand persisted in spite of the cutting off of the water-supply, which\r\nwas believed to be impure. It was finally found that the ground upon\r\nwhich it was built was saturated with all kinds of impurities. Volz\r\nrefers to outbreaks of the disease from the same cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Die Typhus Epidemie in Fusillier Bat. zu Tübingen in\r\nWinter 1876-77, enstanden durch einathmung, giftiger Grundluft_,\r\nTubingen, 1880.]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most striking example of this mode of propagation of\r\nthe disease is that recorded by Budd,[35] and is as follows: Two\r\nadjacent cottages, which for the sake of convenience may be designated\r\nas Nos. 1 and 2, had a privy in common, which was in the form of a\r\nlean-to against the gable end of No. 2. Through this privy there\r\nflowed with very feeble current a small stream which formed the\r\nnatural drain for it. Having already performed this office for some\r\ntwenty or thirty other houses higher up its course, the stream had\r\nacquired all the character of a common sewer before reaching the\r\ncottages in question. About a quarter of a mile farther on it acted as\r\na drain for a privy, common as before, for two other cottages, Nos. 3\r\nand 4. Notwithstanding the condition of the stream, which was so foul\r\nthat it was said that the stink from it was often enough \"to knock a\r\nman down,\" no evil result appeared to have occurred until a man living\r\nin No. 1 contracted typhoid fever--elsewhere, it was believed. As a\r\nmatter of course, all his discharges were thrown into the common\r\nprivy. In this way for more than a fortnight the stream which passed\r\nthrough it was daily fed with the specific excreta from the diseased\r\nintestines of the patient. No further cases occurred until the latter\r\nend of the third week or the beginning of the fourth week, when\r\nseveral persons were simultaneously attacked by the same fever in all\r\nfour cottages. From first to last, the outbreak was confined to these\r\nfour cottages, and there was no other case of typhoid fever at this\r\ntime in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Typhoid Fever: Its Nature, Mode of Spreading, and\r\nPrevention_, by William Budd, M.D., F.R.S., London, 1873.]\r\n\r\nThe mattrass used by typhoid-fever patients, their bed-linen and\r\nclothes, have each been the medium by which the disease has been\r\ncommunicated to others. This is, as has already been pointed out,\r\nunquestionably due to the fact that these articles are generally\r\nsoiled by their discharges, and that time has been allowed for the\r\nlatter to acquire infective properties. It seems not improbable that\r\nthe few cases in which the disease appears to have been contracted\r\nfrom the dead body may be explained in the same way. The statistics of\r\nthe London Fever Hospital show that laundresses are more liable to\r\ncontract typhoid fever than the immediate attendants upon the sick.\r\nThis liability is greatest in those cases in which the bed-linen and\r\nclothes of patients are not immediately disinfected after use.\r\nAccording to Budd, the sputa in cases of typhoid fever where\r\nbronchitis is excessive may sometimes contain the germs of the\r\ndisease, and mentioned a case in which he believed they were the means\r\nby which the disease was propagated.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises here, whether this is the only way in\r\n{254} which the disease can originate. This is a subject which has\r\ngiven rise to a good deal of controversy, and therefore demands some\r\nconsideration at our hands. On the one hand, it is argued that typhoid\r\nfever never occurs in the absence of the specific poison or germ of\r\nthe disease, and that this is contained principally, if not wholly, in\r\nthe alvine dejections. On the other hand, it is contended that it may,\r\nand often does, originate spontaneously, and that all that is\r\nnecessary to produce it is the presence of decomposing fecal or other\r\norganic matter, and the consequent contamination of the food, drink,\r\nor atmosphere. Both of these views have found able advocates. Among\r\nthe upholders of the latter view is Murchison, who cites the histories\r\nof several outbreaks of typhoid fever which occurred in localities\r\nwhich had not been visited by it for many years, and which, after a\r\ncareful investigation of all the circumstances attending them, he was\r\nforced to conclude had no connection with any previous case of the\r\ndisease, and could only be explained by admitting that it might\r\noccasionally have an independent origin. Among the more remarkable of\r\nthese outbreaks is the following, which we give in Murchison's own\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"In August, 1829, 20 out of 22 boys at a school at Clapham within\r\nthree hours were seized with fever, vomiting, purging, and excessive\r\nprostration. One other boy, aged three, had been attacked with similar\r\nsymptoms two days before, and had died comatose in twenty-three hours;\r\nanother boy, aged five, died in twenty-five hours; all the rest\r\nrecovered. Suspicions were entertained that they had been poisoned,\r\nand a rigorous investigation ensued. The only cause which could be\r\ndiscovered was, that a drain at the back of the house, which had been\r\nchoked up for many years, had been opened two days before the first\r\ncase of illness, cleared out, and its contents spread over a garden\r\nadjoining the boys' playground. A most offensive effluvium escaped\r\nfrom the drain, and the boys had watched the workmen cleaning it out.\r\nThis was considered to be the cause of the disease by Latham and\r\nChambers, and by others who investigated the matter, and also by Sir\r\nThomas Watson. The morbid appearances in the two fatal cases were\r\ndescribed as like those of the common fevers of this country. Peyer's\r\npatches and the solitary glands of the small and large intestines were\r\nenlarged like 'condylomatous elevations,' and in one case the mucous\r\nmembrane over them was slightly ulcerated. The mesenteric glands were\r\nenlarged and congested.\"\r\n\r\n\"A remarkable instance of a circumscribed outbreak of fever was\r\nrecorded by Sir R. Christison in 1846. It occurred in an isolated\r\nfarm-house in the thinly-peopled county of Peebles, N.B. Every one of\r\nthe fifteen residents was seized with fever, and three died. Many of\r\nthe servants who worked during the day at the farm were also affected,\r\nbut none communicated the disease to their families who did not visit\r\nthe farm. There was no evidence that the disease was imported from\r\nwithout, and the only explanation of the outbreak was, that the drains\r\nand sewers were found all closed and obstructed with the accumulated\r\nfilth proceeding from the privies and farm-yard, the effluvia from\r\nwhich was very offensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"About Easter, 1848, a formidable outbreak of fever occurred in the\r\nWestminster School and the Abbey Cloisters, and for some days there\r\n{255} was a panic in the neighborhood respecting the 'Westminster\r\nfever.' No case of fever had occurred in the Abbey Cloisters for three\r\nyears, and there was no evidence of its having been imported. Within\r\nlittle more than eleven days it affected thirty-six persons, all of\r\nthe better class, and in three instances it proved fatal. Shortly\r\nbefore its first appearance there occurred two or three days of\r\npeculiarly hot weather, and a disagreeable stench, so powerful as to\r\ninduce nausea, was complained of in the houses in question. It was\r\nfound that the disease followed very exactly in its course the line of\r\na foul and neglected private sewer or immense cesspool, in which fecal\r\nmatter had been accumulating for years without any exit, and into\r\nwhich the contents of several small cesspools had been pumped\r\nimmediately before the outbreak of fever. This elongated cesspool\r\ncommunicated by direct openings with the drains of all the houses in\r\nwhich it occurred; the only exception was that of several boys, who\r\nlived in a house at a little distance, but who were in the habit of\r\nplaying every day in a yard in which there were several gully-holes\r\nopening into the foul drain.\"\r\n\r\nThe following cases would seem, however, to furnish stronger evidence\r\nin favor of the occasional spontaneous origin of typhoid fever than\r\nany of those referred to by Murchison. The first is recorded by P.\r\nHerbert Metcalfe,[36] and occurred in Norfolk Island in the Pacific\r\nOcean, 400 miles from the nearest inhabited land. The patient was a\r\ngentleman who had come from England four months previously. To\r\nMetcalfe's certain knowledge, there had been no typhoid fever on the\r\nisland for fifteen months. Three years previously a man is reported to\r\nhave died of it, and in 1868 there had been an epidemic of fever, but\r\nhe could not ascertain of what kind. Upon inquiry, he found that his\r\npatient had been drinking water from a well which had the reputation\r\nof being unclean, and that he was the only person who had done so. He\r\nalso found that at a distance of seven feet there was an open sewer,\r\nand that just opposite to the well much of the sewage-water became so\r\nstagnant as to form an offensive cesspool. The well was cleaned out,\r\nand at the bottom of it were found four feet of stinking sewage mud,\r\nthe skeleton of a duck, a pig's jaw, etc. The well was so situated\r\nthat had there been any typhoid fever previously to this case the\r\nwater could not have been contaminated by the specific poison, as the\r\nabove-named sewer only conveyed water from the kitchen, which is a\r\nbuilding detached from the dwelling-houses of the mission, and is far\r\nfrom and on a higher level than the open closets in use.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _British Medical Journal_, Nov. 6, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIn the second case, which is reported by R. Bruce Low,[37] Medical\r\nOfficer of Health, Helmsley, Yorkshire, occurred in a lad who had not\r\nbeen away from his home for months. No stranger had visited his house,\r\nand there was no fever in the district, the last case having occurred\r\neight months previously in a sequestered valley eight miles away. The\r\npatient's habits and those of his family were revoltingly dirty. The\r\ngarden privy was in bad repair, the filth level with the seat, and the\r\nsmell from it very offensive. Thirty years before there had been five\r\ncases of slow typhus in the house. In his remarks on this case Low\r\nsays: \"This case did not owe its origin to direct infection, and the\r\nquestion naturally arises, was this a case originating de novo, or had\r\nthe poison {256} been due to infection in some way or another from the\r\ncases which occurred thirty years previously?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Brit. Med. Jour._, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThere can be but little doubt that in many of the cases cited by\r\nMurchison as instances of the spontaneous origin of typhoid fever\r\nthere was an introduction of the germs of the disease from without. At\r\nall events, the evidence to the contrary is by no means convincing.\r\nFor example, in the account of the outbreak at the Westminster School\r\nit is expressly stated that \"the contents of several small cesspools\r\nhad been pumped before the outbreak of the fever\" into the large\r\ncesspool, the emanations from which it was believed had caused the\r\nfever. It does not seem that it was positively ascertained that none\r\nof these small cesspools had been used by a typhoid-fever patient, or\r\nthat typhoid stools had not found their way into them in some other\r\nway. Moreover, in diseases generally admitted to be contagious it is\r\nnot always possible to ascertain positively the source of infection in\r\na particular instance. But after the elimination of all doubtful cases\r\nthere yet remains a certain number in which it is reasonably certain\r\nthat there has been no recent importation of the typhoid-fever germs,\r\nas in the case which is reported by Metcalfe and which occurred on\r\nNorfolk Island, and in that recorded by Low. The assumption does not\r\nseem an unwarranted one that in these cases the poison of the disease,\r\nwhich had been present before in a latent condition, had been suddenly\r\ncalled into activity by favoring influences. The following observation\r\nof Von Gietl[38] shows the length of time typhoid-fever stools may\r\nretain their infective properties: \"To a village free from typhoid an\r\ninhabitant returned suffering from the disease, which he had acquired\r\nat a distant place. His evacuations were buried in a dunghill. Some\r\nweeks later five persons, who were employed in removing dung from this\r\nheap, were attacked by typhoid fever; their alvine discharges were\r\nagain buried deeply in the same heap, and nine months later one of two\r\nmen who were employed in the complete removal of the dung was attacked\r\nand died.\" If we assume--and there is no reason to doubt that this\r\npoint was fully investigated by Von Gietl--that the patient in the\r\nlatter case had not been otherwise exposed to the causes of the\r\ndisease, the observation shows that the stools in typhoid fever retain\r\ntheir virulence for nine months. If for nine months, why may they not\r\ndo so for a much longer period--for as many years, for example? No\r\nprobability is violated by this hypothesis. On the contrary, it is in\r\nfull accordance with what we know of some of the lower forms of life,\r\nand will serve to explain many outbreaks of the disease which would\r\notherwise be inexplicable--for example, the outbreak at Clapham\r\nreferred to by Murchison. Admitting that the disease in this instance\r\nwas really typhoid fever--and this has been denied by some observers,\r\namong whom is Sir Thomas Watson--the assumption does not seem an\r\nunwarrantable one that the germs of typhoid fever had been present in\r\nthis choked-up drain long before it was cleared, but that in\r\nconsequence of their exclusion from the air their infecting power was\r\nat a minimum. It was, on the contrary, much increased when the\r\ncontents of the drain were exposed to the vivifying influence of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Quoted by Cayley, _Brit. Med. Jour._, Mar. 15, 1880.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is alleged that an individual may be exposed to\r\nthe direct emanations of sewers or of foul privies, or even drink\r\nwater {257} contaminated by leakage from them, without contracting\r\ntyphoid fever, so long as they do not contain the specific germ of the\r\ndisease. Every physician in large practice, either in the city or\r\ncountry, can call to mind instances in which the air of houses or the\r\nwater-supply has been polluted in this way, and yet no typhoid fever\r\nhas occurred. Let, however, the specific cause of the disease be\r\nintroduced from without, and this immunity almost invariably\r\ndisappears. There is no reason to believe that the contamination of\r\nthe water used by the family which suffered in the outbreak of the\r\ndisease which has been already referred to as having come under my own\r\nobservation last year was of recent origin. On the contrary, there was\r\nevidence to the contrary, and yet no disease occurred until it was\r\nimported by a member of the family who was in the habit of making\r\nfrequent visits to the city. Even more strongly corroborative of this\r\nview is the history of the epidemic reported by Ballard, in which milk\r\nwas the medium of communication. The water which had been used with\r\nimpunity to wash the milk-pans, or perhaps to dilute the milk, became\r\na source of danger only after the occurrence of the disease in the\r\nfamily of the dairyman.\r\n\r\nSeveral epidemics of typhoid fever have been recently reported in\r\nwhich the disease appears to have been caused by the use of the flesh\r\nof diseased animals or of meat in a condition of putrefaction. In some\r\nof these the symptoms were rather those of irritant poisoning than of\r\ntyphoid fever, and consisted principally in violent vomiting and\r\npurging coming on very shortly after the ingestion of the unwholesome\r\nfood. There yet remains a certain number in which the symptoms cannot\r\nbe thus explained.[39] One of the most remarkable of these occurred in\r\n1878 at a festival which was held at Kloten, a place about seven miles\r\nnorth of Zurich, of which the following is a condensed description:\r\nOut of 690 persons who sat down to the collation, 290 were taken ill;\r\n378 other persons, who did not attend the festival, but who partook of\r\nthe meat provided for it, were also affected. In addition these, 49\r\nsecondary cases occurred--_i.e._ of persons who subsequently became\r\naffected without having eaten of the meat. All other sources of\r\ninfection could be certainly excluded, as Kloten was quite free from\r\ntyphoid fever at the time, and as it was clearly shown that the water\r\nwas not the cause of the outbreak. All the visitors at the festival\r\nwho ate no meat escaped, as did also several persons who drank wine to\r\nexcess and subsequently vomited. The period of incubation was short,\r\nas in other epidemics arising from the same cause. Some of the people\r\nwere ill on the second day, with loss of appetite, nausea, headache,\r\npain and swelling of the belly, and slight fever. These cases were\r\nslight, and generally ended in recovery. The greater number were\r\naffected between the fifth and ninth days. The symptoms in these\r\ncases, which usually ran a rapid course, and generally ended in\r\nrecovery, were chills, fever, diarrhoea, great prostration, frequently\r\nviolent delirium, and also profuse intestinal hemorrhage. The\r\nrose-colored eruption was present in almost all of them, and in a few\r\nthe tâches bleuâtres were detected. On post-mortem {258} examination\r\nthe characteristic appearances of typhoid fever were found. With\r\nregard to the meat supplied, the following facts were ascertained:\r\nForty-two pounds of veal were furnished by a butcher at Seebach, taken\r\nfrom a calf which appears to have been at the point of death when it\r\nreceived the coup de grace from the hands of the butcher. All the\r\nflesh of the animal was sent to supply the festival at Kloten, but the\r\nliver was eaten by an inhabitant of Seebach, and he was attacked by\r\ntyphoid fever. The brain was sent to the parsonage at Seebach, and all\r\nthe household became affected by the same disease. It was also\r\nascertained that another of the calves was diseased. The veal from\r\nthis calf had been kept fourteen days, and was in a decomposed state.\r\nAll the meat was placed together in the meat-receptacle of the inn at\r\nwhich the festival was held. This receptacle was in a horribly filthy\r\nstate, and Cayley thinks there can be no doubt that the putrefying\r\nflesh of this last calf, together with the state of the receptacle,\r\nwould rapidly excite decomposition in the whole supply.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _On Some Points in the Pathology and Treatment of\r\nTyphoid Fever_, by William Cayley, London, 1880; also Prof. Huguenin,\r\n_Schmidt's Jahrbuch_, from _Schweiz. Corr. Bl._, viii. 15, 1878; Carl\r\nWalder, _Schmidt's Jahrbuch_, from _Berl. klin. Wochenschr._, xv. 39,\r\n40, 1878; George R. Shattuck, M.D., Supplement to _Ziemssen's\r\nCyclopædia_, New York, 1881.]\r\n\r\nGeissler, it is true, doubts whether the epidemic above described was\r\nreally typhoid fever, and points out that the symptoms occurred too\r\nsoon after the ingestion of the diseased meat, and reached their full\r\ndevelopment too rapidly. The cases were also accompanied by more pain\r\nin the abdomen than is generally met with in typhoid fever. The\r\nproportion of recoveries also appears to have been unusually large.\r\nUnquestionably, the patients in the Kloten epidemic were in a large\r\nnumber of instances simply suffering from the action of an irritant\r\npoison; but the presence of the characteristic lesions of typhoid\r\nfever in some of the fatal cases renders it certain that this disease\r\nalso existed in the village at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the report of this epidemic it is not stated that either of the\r\ncalves which furnished a part of the meat for the entertainment were\r\nsuffering from typhoid fever at the time they were slaughtered. It is\r\nnow known positively that this animal is liable to be attacked by this\r\ndisease, and a certain number of cases are on record in which the\r\neating of the flesh of such animals has been followed by typhoid\r\nfever.[40] That it does not oftener occur from this cause is probably\r\ndue to the fact that a certain time must elapse before the flesh of\r\nsuch an animal acquires infective properties, and that it is usually\r\nused as food before this has been allowed to pass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Medical Times and Gazette_, Feb. 8, 1879, p. 149, from\r\n_Berl. klin. Wochenschrift_, No. 39, 1878.]\r\n\r\nLudwig Letzench[41] asserts that he has produced some of the\r\nintestinal appearances of typhoid fever, as well as a high degree of\r\npyrexia, in rabbits by the subcutaneous injection of the sputa and\r\nstools of typhoid fever patients.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Arch. f. exper. Pathol. u. Pharmak._, 1878 and 1881.]\r\n\r\nTHE BACILLUS TYPHOSUS.--From what has preceded, it will be seen that\r\nthe writer is disposed to range himself with those who hold that the\r\nexciting cause of typhoid fever is an organized germ, or, in other\r\nwords, a contagium vivum. Although this view cannot be regarded as\r\npositively proven as yet, it has recently received some support\r\nthrough the investigations of Klebs, Eberth of Zurich, and others,[42]\r\nwho believe that they {259} have found in the bodies of those who have\r\ndied of typhoid fever a micro-organism peculiar to that disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Klebs (_Philadelphia Medical Times_, Dec. 3, 1881, from\r\n_Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie_, Bd. xiii. H.\r\n5 and 6) claims that he has proved \"that there exists in typhoid fever\r\na separate and distinct bacillus--the _Bacillus typhosus_; that it\r\nundergoes certain transformations, consisting at first of little rods\r\nand small fine threads, containing a spore in the centre and often at\r\nthe end, which spores divide off and form new bacilli. It later\r\nassumes a larger thread-like form, twisted at the end, and frequently\r\ntaking a beautiful spiral shape; that the bacilli are observed first\r\nin the masses of epithelial cells which accumulate in the alimentary\r\ntract or in the air-passages; that they later penetrate the tissues,\r\nand are carried along by the blood-vessels and the lymphatics, and\r\nform a large network among the tissues they invade; that under a\r\ncertain procedure, which never causes this same staining in any other\r\nliving organism or tissue, they appear of a blue color; that they are\r\nfound only in enteric fever, in which disease every part of the human\r\nbody is the seat of masses of these bacilli, their quantity\r\ncorresponding exactly with the severity of the symptoms; and that they\r\nproduce, when carried into the system of animals, exactly the same\r\ndisease with the same morbid alterations as in men.\" He says, further,\r\nthat \"the Bacillus typhosus enters the system by the respiratory\r\npassages and by the alimentary canal. This is the cause that in some\r\ncases of typhoid fever almost no abdominal symptoms are present, but a\r\nlow form of pneumonia, developing from the very beginning, so that the\r\nlung seems alone to bear the brunt of the disease.\" He has found these\r\nbacilli in greatest numbers in Peyer's patches.\r\n\r\nEberth (_British Medical Journal_, Nov. 26, 1881, from _Virchow's\r\nArchiv_, Bd. lxxxi. and lxxxiii.) has shown that in typhoid fever the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane, the mesenteric glands, and the spleen\r\ncontain rod bacteria, differing, as he believes, from organisms found\r\nin the body in other conditions (among others in phthisis with\r\nextensive ulceration of the intestinal mucous membrane). In seventeen\r\ncases of typhoid these bacilli were found in six and wanting in\r\neleven. In the six cases the number of bacilli were in inverse\r\nproportion to the duration of the disease. They were not found in the\r\nspleen in the cases of the longest duration, and only scantily in the\r\nmesenteric glands. These bacilli appear not to differ in shape and\r\nsize from the ordinary rod bacteria, but Eberth believes that they\r\ndiffer from them in their small capacity for taking on the staining of\r\nhæmatoxylon, methyl-violet, and Bismarck brown.\r\n\r\nWernich's views (_Vjhrschr. f. Off. Geshpfl._, xiii. 4, p. 513, 1881)\r\nin regard to the nature of the Bacillus typhosus differ from those\r\nheld by the two authors just quoted. He regards the specific Bacillus\r\ntyphosus as nothing but the ordinary Bacillus subtilis of the large\r\nintestines, which under certain circumstances acquires the power to\r\naccommodate itself to the small intestines, to undergo a higher\r\ndevelopment and to become the exciting cause of disease.]\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF INCUBATION.--The conditions under which typhoid fever occurs\r\nin large cities render it difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at a\r\ndefinite conclusion as to its period of incubation. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, the time which has intervened between the exposure to the\r\ncause and the invasion of the disease may be ascertained with\r\nprecision in the outbreaks which occur in small towns or in isolated\r\ncountry-houses. Under these circumstances it has been found to vary\r\nwithin very wide limits. In the three cases related by Griesinger the\r\nattack began the day after exposure to the infection, and in the\r\noutbreak at the school at Clapham, referred to by Murchison, twenty\r\nout of twenty-two boys were seized with the disease within four days\r\nof exposure to the causes. Other instances of a similar character are\r\non record. In cases like the above the rapidity with which the attack\r\nfollows upon exposure to the cause is no doubt due to the intensity of\r\nthe poison--a view which is to a certain extent at least supported by\r\nthe fact that the invasion of the disease under these circumstances is\r\nvery apt to be abrupt; the attack being often ushered in with vomiting\r\nand purging or with grave cerebral symptoms. Sometimes, indeed, the\r\ngastro-intestinal symptoms have been so violent as to have given rise\r\nto suspicions of criminal or accidental poisoning. In the majority of\r\ncases, however, the period of incubation is probably very much longer\r\nthan in those above referred to. In the outbreak which recently\r\noccurred in a farm-house about seven miles distant from {260}\r\nPhiladelphia, the history of which has already been given in detail,\r\nthe second case began three weeks after the first, the other six\r\nfollowing in rapid succession. In the celebrated epidemic which\r\noccurred at Lausen in Switzerland in 1872, and which is referred to by\r\nCayley,[43] the first ten patients were attacked within three weeks of\r\nthe time when the contamination of the spring which supplied the\r\nvillage must have taken place, and these ten cases were followed in\r\nthe course of nine days by fifty-seven others. In the town of Over\r\nDarwen 1500 persons were seized with typhoid fever within three weeks\r\nafter a patient suffering from this disease was brought to a\r\nparticular house, the sewage of which was allowed to soak into the\r\nground through which the water-supply pipes of the town passed, and at\r\na point at which they were leaky. Lothholz observed in an epidemic\r\nwhich occurred in the neighborhood of Jena that the average period of\r\nincubation was three weeks, the shortest period eighteen days, the\r\nlongest twenty-eight days. Haegler found in three cases produced by\r\ncontaminated water a period of at least three weeks.[44] There are,\r\nhowever, epidemics on record in which the period of incubation was\r\nunder two weeks, as, for instance, that of Basle, referred to by\r\nLiebermeister, in which a few persons were attacked who had only been\r\nin the city from seven to fourteen days. Cayley also refers to\r\nlocalized outbreaks of the disease, as those of Calne and Nunney, in\r\nwhich persons were attacked within fourteen days of their exposure to\r\nthe cause. C. J. C. Muller of Posen[45] says that the average period\r\nof incubation of the disease is fourteen days; that it may be not more\r\nthan ten days, or, on the other hand, as long as from three to four\r\nweeks; and that he has known a case in which it was thirty-four days.\r\nMurchison believed that it was most commonly about two weeks, and\r\nWilliam Budd arrived at the conclusion, from the observation of a\r\nlarge number of cases, that it varied from ten to fourteen days.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Brit. Med. Jour._, Mar. 15, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Ziemssen's Cyclopædia_, vol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Neue Beiträge zur Aetologie des Unterleibs-Typhus_,\r\nPosen, 1878.]\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the opinions of various authors the conclusion\r\nwould seem to be justifiable that the period of incubation in typhoid\r\nfever is usually between two and three weeks, but that in many cases\r\nit does not exceed ten days, and in rare instances has unquestionably\r\nbeen very much less. On the other hand, there are authentic cases on\r\nrecord in which it is said to have reached, or even exceeded,\r\ntwenty-eight days. Unfortunately, we do not possess any reliable data\r\nwith which to decide the question whether it is shorter or longer when\r\nthe poison is imbibed with the ingesta than when it is inhaled. It\r\nwould seem, however, that there is a difference in the susceptibility\r\nof different individuals to the poison of this disease, in many\r\npersons a single exposure to the cause being sufficient to induce an\r\nattack, while in others the disease is contracted only after repeated\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--As a thorough knowledge of the morbid anatomy of\r\ntyphoid fever is absolutely necessary to a correct understanding of\r\nits pathology, it seems to me better to deviate from the order usually\r\nobserved in systematic treatises and to proceed at once to a\r\ndescription of the former, rather than to defer it, as it is usual to\r\ndo, until after the symptomatology of the disease has been discussed.\r\n\r\nRigor mortis is generally more marked and more prolonged than after\r\n{261} typhus. Emaciation is often extreme in cases in which death has\r\ntaken place after the third week, especially if they have been\r\nattended by much diarrhoea and fever. No traces of the characteristic\r\nrose-colored eruption are found after death, no matter how profuse it\r\nmay have been during life. Sudamina, on the other hand, persist, and\r\ndiscolorations of the dependent portions from settling of blood are\r\nalways present in the dead body.\r\n\r\nThe lesions of typhoid fever may be divided into two classes. The\r\nfirst class includes certain changes in the glands of Peyer, the\r\nsolitary glands of the intestines, the spleen, and other lymphatic\r\nstructures of the body. These changes, which consist essentially in a\r\nmedullary infiltration of these glands, will be minutely described\r\npresently. They are peculiar to the disease, and are just as\r\ncharacteristic of it as the condition of the lungs and their membranes\r\nfound in pneumonia and pleurisy are characteristic of those diseases.\r\nThey are usually most developed in grave cases, but occasionally they\r\nare slight and but little marked in cases in which the general\r\nsymptoms were severe. They therefore cannot be regarded as the sole\r\ncause of the latter. It is more probable that they are themselves the\r\nresults of the local action of the typhoid poison, and bear somewhat\r\nof the same relation to typhoid fever that the eruption in small-pox\r\ndoes to that disease. The second class is made up of lesions which are\r\nmet with not only in this disease, but in other diseases accompanied\r\nby high fever, and are therefore unquestionably the result of the\r\ngeneral process. They consist essentially of parenchymatous\r\ndegenerations of various organs and tissues, and are generally more\r\nmarked in typhoid fever because the pyrexia is not only of high grade,\r\nbut also of longer duration than in other diseases.\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider the lesions peculiar to typhoid fever. Among\r\nthe most important of these are the changes which occur in the\r\nagminated and solitary glands of the intestines. These have been\r\nusually described as passing through four stages, as follows: (1) the\r\nstage of medullary infiltration; (2) the stage of softening or\r\nsloughing; (3) the stage of ulceration; (4) the stage of\r\ncicatrization. These stages are said to last almost a week, and\r\ncorrespond to certain definite periods of the disease, but it is not\r\nuncommon to find in the same intestine glands in two or more of these\r\nstages. Indeed, the same gland may sometimes be found ulcerating at\r\none side while cicatrization is going on at the other.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage the agminated glands are enlarged, each patch\r\npreserving its oblong shape, and being flattened on the surface and\r\nelevated from half a line to two lines above the surrounding mucous\r\nmembrane, from which it is separated by an abrupt border, and which it\r\nmay in a few cases overhang like a fungous growth. The solitary\r\nfollicles are also swollen, and may vary in size from a hempseed to a\r\nsplit pea. In very severe cases all the glands may be more or less\r\ninvolved, but in mild cases the changes may be limited to three or\r\nfour of the patches of Peyer, although the solitary glands rarely\r\nwholly escape. It is uncommon also for the latter to be alone\r\naffected, but a few such cases have been reported. In these the mucous\r\nmembrane appears to be studded with pustules, and hence Cruveilhier\r\ndesignated this variety as the forme pustuleuse. The mucous membrane\r\ncovering the affected glands is reddish-green in color, and that in\r\ntheir immediate vicinity is {262} often injected. The changes above\r\ndescribed occur early in the disease--Murchison has seen them in two\r\ncases in which death took place at the end of the first day--and they\r\nare often well marked at the end of the third or fourth day. They are\r\nusually limited to the glands in the lower part of the ileum, the\r\nagminated glands being often found perfectly healthy four feet above\r\nthe ileo-cæcal valve. In mild cases, indeed, the lesions may be\r\nconfined to those nearest to this valve. So, too, the changes in the\r\nsolitary glands may be confined to the last twelve inches of the\r\nsmaller intestine, but this is by no means universally the case, for\r\nthese glands are not only often found enlarged higher up in the small\r\nintestine, but also occasionally in the cæcum. The agminated glands\r\nare sometimes found enlarged in the bodies of those who have died of\r\nmeasles and of some other diseases, but the degree of enlargement is\r\nrarely as great as in typhoid fever, and the further changes presently\r\nto be described are never found except in the latter disease.\r\n\r\nUnder the microscope the medullary infiltration upon which the\r\nenlargement of the glands depends is found to be due to proliferation\r\nof the cellular elements. In the case of the agminated glands this\r\nproliferation may be limited to the follicles or it may extend to the\r\nintercellular tissue, and even to the adjacent mucous membrane. In the\r\nformer case the patches have a reticulated aspect; they are soft and\r\nbut little elevated. These are the plaques molles of Louis and the\r\nplaques reticulées of Chomel. In the latter they are harder, smoother,\r\nand more elevated. To this variety Louis has given the name of plaques\r\ndures, Chomel that of plaques gauffrées. The morbid process is also\r\nvery apt to extend from the solitary follicles to the surrounding\r\nmucous membrane.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of the glands in many cases, and probably in all of\r\nthem in the abortive form of the disease, the changes never advance\r\nbeyond the first stage, a restoration to their normal condition taking\r\nplace by colliquative softening.[46] The morbid material upon which\r\ntheir enlargement depends breaks down into an oily débris which is\r\ngradually absorbed. This retrograde process takes place faster in the\r\nfollicles than in the interfollicular tissue, and, as pigment is very\r\napt to be deposited in the depressions thus formed, the patches\r\nacquire an appearance which has been compared to that of a recently\r\nshaven beard. This appearance is met with, however, in other diseases,\r\nand is therefore not peculiar to typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Rindfleisch, _Pathological Histology_, Sydenham Society\r\nTranslation, vol. i. p. 441.]\r\n\r\nThe description of the changes in these glands in the subsequent\r\nstages of the disease which follows is taken mainly from Rindfleisch's\r\nwork on _Pathological Histology_.\r\n\r\nIn the stage of necrosis small portions of single Peyerian patches,\r\nvarying in size from that of a lentil to from three-quarters of an\r\ninch to an inch and a quarter in diameter, assume a yellowish-white,\r\nopaque tint instead of their former reddish and translucent aspect,\r\ngradually become separated from the surrounding tissue by a sharp line\r\nof demarcation, and then pass into a state of cheesy necrosis. Here\r\nand there the same changes are observed to have taken place in the\r\nsolitary glands. When once this has occurred, recovery can only take\r\nplace by expulsion of the necrosed parts and consequent ulceration.\r\nNecrosis of the glands {263} probably rarely occurs before the\r\nbeginning of the second week, but it has occasionally been observed\r\nmuch earlier. Murchison reports cases in which he saw it as early as\r\nthe first and second days. The process usually involves the mucous\r\nmembrane only, but it may extend to the muscular and even to the\r\nperitoneal coats.\r\n\r\nIn the third stage the dead parts are gradually thrown off, the\r\nprocess of separation usually occupying several days. At first an\r\nincreased degree of congestion, followed by suppuration, is observed\r\nat the edges of the sloughs, which before their complete detachment\r\nmay often acquire a yellow, green, or brown color from the imbibition\r\nof bile. The ulcers which result correspond in size and form with the\r\nsloughs. They are, therefore, in the case of the agminated glands\r\nelliptical in shape, with their long diameter corresponding to the\r\naxis of the intestine. Their edges are swollen and overhanging, and\r\ntheir floor is generally formed by the deepest layer of the submucous\r\nconnective tissue. They sometimes penetrate much more deeply, and may\r\neven extend to the peritoneal coat, and thus give rise to perforation\r\nof the bowel. The ulcers which result from sloughing of the solitary\r\nglands are, as a rule, small and round. Murchison says that ulceration\r\nmay also be produced in the following way: The mucous membrane becomes\r\nsoftened, and one or more superficial abrasions appear on the surface\r\nof the diseased patch, which extend and unite into one large ulcer,\r\nand this ulcer proceeds to various depths through the coats of the\r\nbowel, and even to completed perforation, but Rindfleisch and other\r\nrecent German writers do not allude to this process.\r\n\r\nThe fourth stage, or that of cicatrization, usually commences with the\r\nbeginning of the fourth week. The swelling of the edges of the ulcers\r\ngradually diminishes, and they become adherent to the tissues beneath.\r\nThe floor of the ulcers covers itself with delicate granulations,\r\nwhich in course of time are converted into connective tissue. This is\r\nultimately coated with epithelium, but neither the villi nor the\r\nglands of the mucous membrane are ever reproduced. The resulting\r\ncicatrices may be recognized by the affected parts of the bowel being\r\nthin and more translucent than in health, and may retain these\r\ncharacters after the lapse of several years. They never give rise to\r\ncontraction of the bowel. The time occupied in the cicatrization of\r\neach ulcer is said to be about two weeks. It occasionally happens that\r\nwhile cicatrization is taking place at one end of the ulcer the\r\nprocess of necrosis and ulceration is still going on at the other, so\r\nthat two or more ulcers may occasionally run together. This form of\r\nulcer may often retard recovery, and may sometimes end in perforation\r\nof the bowel, even after convalescence seems to have been established.\r\n\r\nThe color and consistence of the mucous membrane of the cæcum and\r\ncolon are in a large proportion of cases normal. In a few the membrane\r\nis paler than in health, and in others it is of an ash-gray color. It\r\nis also sometimes injected and softened. The solitary glands are\r\nfrequently enlarged and ulcerated, like those of the ileum. In the\r\nformer case the mucous membranes of the large intestine throughout its\r\nwhole extent, but especially that of the cæcum and of the part of the\r\ncolon adjacent to it, is studded with minute elevations about a line\r\nin diameter. When ulceration has occurred the ulcers are generally\r\nround {264} and small, but they may occasionally be oval and of\r\nconsiderable size. In the latter case their long diameter will\r\ncorrespond in direction with that of the circular fibres of the\r\nintestine. Murchison has known them to measure fully an inch and a\r\nhalf in length. The colon is generally found much distended with\r\nflatus.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the mesenteric glands from cellular hyperplasia and\r\nhypertrophy of the connective tissue is constantly associated with the\r\nmorbid changes of the intestines just described. This enlargement\r\nvaries in different cases. In some the glands are not larger than a\r\npea or bean; in others they are said to have reached the size of a\r\nhen's egg. It is always more marked in the glands which lie in the\r\nangle between the lower end of the ileum and the cæcum, and usually\r\nbears some proportion to the intensity of the local disease; but it is\r\nnot to be regarded merely as a result of the local irritation, as it\r\nhas been observed in parts of the mesentery corresponding to perfectly\r\nhealthy portions of the intestine, and as the meso-colic glands have\r\nbeen involved in cases in which the colon was free from disease. It\r\nhas, moreover, been observed in cases in which death has occurred very\r\nearly in the disease, and there can therefore be little doubt that it\r\nis as much the result of the infective process as the infiltration of\r\nPeyer's patches. In addition to being enlarged, if death has taken\r\nplace before the end of the second week the glands are hyperæmic and\r\nof a purplish color. Later than this, when the sloughs become detached\r\nfrom Peyer's patches, the swelling of the glands diminishes; they lose\r\ntheir color and become pale, and if convalescence ensues they return\r\nfinally to their former healthy condition. Still, Murchison has seen\r\nthem shrivelled and pale or bluish for some time after convalescence.\r\nIn other cases the substance of the glands softens, with the formation\r\nof a puriform liquid. If the softening only involves a small part of\r\nthe glandular structure, restoration to health may take place through\r\nthe absorption of this liquid. If it is more extensive, the whole of\r\nthe glands may break down into this puriform liquid, which, when the\r\npatient recovers, undergoes caseous and finally calcareous\r\ndegeneration. Occasionally, a gland in this condition is the cause of\r\ndeath from rupture and extravasation of its contents into the cavity\r\nof the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThe glands in the fissure of the liver, the gastric, lumbar, inguinal\r\nglands, and indeed all the lymphatic glands in the body, have\r\noccasionally been found swollen and congested, but their enlargement\r\ncannot be classed among the specific lesions of the disease, but is\r\nmerely the result of a local irritation. Thus, Jenner says that in the\r\ncase of extensive ulceration of the oesophagus which came under his\r\nobservation there was marked enlargement of the oesophageal glands.\r\nLiebermeister says that the lymphatic follicles which surround the\r\nglands at the root of the tongue and in the tonsils are often affected\r\nin the same way as the glands. In most cases after a time the swelling\r\ndisappears, but sometimes softening and rupture take place.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is almost invariably found to be increased in volume and to\r\nhave undergone changes in consistence and color. The degree of\r\nenlargement and the other changes vary of course with the stage of the\r\ndisease at which death has occurred. The enlargement occurs with less\r\nfrequency in elderly than in young people, and is most marked at the\r\nheight {265} of the disease, the organ being then often twice or three\r\ntimes its normal size, and in some cases, it is said, even larger.\r\nLater, and especially during convalescence, the enlargement has\r\ngenerally very much diminished. During the first ten days of the\r\ndisease the spleen is generally tense and firm, engorged with blood,\r\nand dark red in color. Between the tenth and thirtieth days its\r\nappearance remains the same, but the organ is found to be soft and\r\nfriable. During convalescence it becomes paler and firmer again, and\r\nis often so shrunken in size that its capsule is relaxed and wrinkled.\r\nHemorrhagic infarctions are often met with. These sometimes soften and\r\nbreak down into a puriform liquid, which may sometimes cause\r\nperitonitis by rupture into the peritoneal cavity. Rupture of the\r\nspleen is also said to have occurred from mechanical violence. These\r\nchanges are due in part to variations in the amount of blood, and in\r\npart to a medullary infiltration of Malpighian corpuscles similar to\r\nthat which takes place in Peyer's patches and the glands of the\r\nmesentery.\r\n\r\nLESIONS WHICH ARE NOT PECULIAR TO TYPHOID FEVER, BUT ARE OF MORE OR\r\nLESS FREQUENT OCCURRENCE.--The mucous membrane of the pharynx and\r\noesophagus may present a perfectly healthy appearance, but\r\noccasionally it is congested and the seat of ulcerations which are for\r\nthe most part superficial. Sometimes, however, they have been found to\r\nextend to the muscular coat, but they have never been known to\r\npenetrate all the coats of these organs. Jenner refers to one case in\r\nwhich there was extensive ulceration of the oesophagus, but usually\r\nthe number of ulcers is not large. In a few cases the mucous membrane\r\nof the pharynx is coated with diphtheritic false membrane, and the\r\nsubmucous tissue is infiltrated with serum and pus (Murchison).\r\n\r\nThe stomach and the upper part of the intestinal tract present no\r\nlesions which are at all peculiar to typhoid fever. In a certain\r\nnumber of cases congestion, softening, and even superficial\r\nulceration, of the mucous membrane of the stomach, and less frequently\r\nof that of the duodenum, have been found. The mucous membrane of the\r\njejunum and of the upper part of the ileum is not usually much\r\nreddened, and may be even paler than in health. In cases which have\r\nbeen protracted it may be of an ashy-gray or slate color. The contents\r\nof this part of the intestinal tract, which is rarely much distended\r\nby flatus, do not differ materially in appearance or consistence from\r\nthe matter which generally composes the typhoid stool. The bowels may,\r\nof course, be found filled with blood in cases in which a recent\r\nhemorrhage has taken place. Invaginations of the small intestines,\r\nunaccompanied by any evidences of inflammation, are occasionally met\r\nwith in the bodies of those who have died of typhoid fever. They are\r\nproduced, there is good reason to believe, during the death agony, but\r\nare not peculiar to this disease, as they occur in many other\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the liver has been found in only a few cases after\r\ndeath from typhoid fever. Softening is more common, but even this is\r\nnot a frequent result of the disease, for it was absent in 41 out of\r\n73 cases examined with special reference to this point by Louis,\r\nJenner, and Murchison. The organ is occasionally hyperæmic, and darker\r\nin color than in health, but it is oftener pale or normal in\r\nappearance. Even, however, where it appears to be perfectly healthy to\r\nthe unassisted eye, {266} the microscope shows that its cells are very\r\ngranular and filled with oil-globules which often render the nucleus\r\nindistinct or completely conceal it. When death has taken place at an\r\nadvanced stage of the disease many of the cells are found to be\r\ncompletely broken down into a granular detritus. These changes are\r\nusually proportional to the degree of pyrexia which has been present\r\nduring life. Rarer lesions of the liver are pyæmic deposits, embolism,\r\nabscess, and emphysema.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the gall-bladder has been found to be the seat\r\nof ulcers by Jenner and numerous other observers. It also occasionally\r\npresents the evidences of catarrhal or diphtheritic inflammation. The\r\ngall-bladder usually contains a pale watery liquid of a less density\r\nthan bile. When, however, inflammation of its lining membrane has\r\nexisted, its contents are mixed with pus and shreds of false membrane.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the larynx is sometimes found to have been the\r\nseat of catarrhal or diphtheritic inflammation, and sometimes also of\r\nulceration. Jenner says that in typhoid fever laryngitis independent\r\nof pharyngitis is extremely rare, but the German writers express a\r\ndifferent opinion. Griesinger estimated that laryngeal ulcers were\r\npresent in one-fifth of the fatal cases. Hoffmann found them\r\ntwenty-eight times in two hundred and fifty autopsies, and that the\r\nulcers had extended to and involved the cartilages in twenty-two out\r\nof the twenty-eight cases. They are most commonly found in the\r\nposterior wall of the larynx, and may involve the vocal cords. These\r\nare often discovered after death in cases in which their existence was\r\nnot suspected during life. They were formerly supposed to be the\r\nresult of typhoid infiltration of the laryngeal glands, but careful\r\ninvestigation has shown that they are the consequence of diphtheritic\r\ninflammation of the mucous membranes. Inflammation and ulceration of\r\nthe trachea are comparatively rare. Hypostatic congestion and\r\ninfarction of the lungs are not uncommonly found after death from\r\ntyphoid fever, and less frequently the lesions of pneumonia. Evidences\r\nof recent pleurisy are also discovered in a few cases. Acute miliary\r\ntuberculosis of the lungs is more often met with as a sequela than as\r\na complication.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the brain and its membranes caused by typhoid fever are\r\nfew and unimportant, even in cases attended by severe nervous\r\nsymptoms. Those most frequently found are adhesions of the dura mater\r\nto the inner surface of the cranium, injection or oedema of the pia\r\nmater, congestive oedema, and sometimes softening of the brain and\r\neffusion at the base of the brain. The microscopic changes do not\r\nappear to have been carefully studied. Liebermeister says that the\r\ngray substance of the cortical portion of the brain and of the\r\ninterior is sometimes of a rather yellowish-brown color, and that he\r\nnoticed besides diffuse yellow and blackish-brown spots in different\r\nplaces, particularly in the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus. In\r\nsuch places, he says, the microscope shows a diffuse yellow\r\ncoloration, a deposit of small brown pigment-granules, and also,\r\nespecially in the optic thalamus and corpus striatum, the\r\nganglion-cells thickly crowded with brownish or blackish\r\npigment-granules in such numbers as to conceal the outlines of many of\r\nthe cells. These changes Hoffmann,[47] who has specially studied them,\r\nis inclined to place by the side of the parenchymatous degeneration of\r\nother organs. {267} The ganglion-cells of the sympathetic ganglia are\r\nsaid by Virchow also to contain an unusual amount of pigment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nThe muscles are frequently the seat of marked changes in typhoid\r\nfever. Their macroscopic appearances vary with the stage of the\r\ndisease at which they are examined. When death takes place in the\r\nfirst or second week they are usually dark red or reddish-brown in\r\ncolor, and very dry. If it is delayed until later, they \"present a\r\npeculiar fawn or yellow tint permeating the ordinary red in patches\r\nand veins not unlike the appearance of veined marble.\" Their\r\nconsistence is also so much diminished that the finger may be readily\r\npassed through them. Occasionally, pseudo-abscesses and hemorrhages\r\ninto the muscular sheath are found, and Dauvé and B. Ball[48] report\r\ncases in which, in addition to these changes, rupture of muscles had\r\noccurred. Zenker, who was the first to call attention to them, ranged\r\nthe changes seen under the microscope under two heads: (1) granular or\r\nfatty degeneration; (2) waxy degeneration. In the first variety the\r\ntransverse striæ disappear and the sarcolemma appears filled with\r\nfinely granular matter. In the second variety the striated muscles\r\nbecome, as it were, pervaded by a coagulating material which sets, and\r\nin contracting breaks up the fibres into great numbers of short\r\nwaxy-looking lumps, not unlike a certain variety of casts of the\r\ntubuli recti of the kidneys. When recovery takes place the affected\r\nfibre is believed to be regenerated by a cell-growth within the\r\nsarcolemma. These changes occur in most fevers, as typhus, small-pox,\r\nscarlet fever, and are attributed by authors generally to the\r\nhyperpyrexia which is a frequent accompaniment of these diseases.\r\nHayem, however, asserts that he has found them well marked in cases\r\nnot characterized by a high temperature, and that, on the other hand,\r\nthey are sometimes absent in cases where this has been present. The\r\nwaxy form of degeneration may affect all the striped muscles, but is\r\noftenest seen in the muscles of the abdominal walls, the adductors of\r\nthe thigh, the muscles of the diaphragm, and tongue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _L'Union Médicale_, 1866, quoted by _Biennial Retrospect\r\nof Medicine and Surgery and their Allied Sciences_, for 1865-66.]\r\n\r\nThe heart, in common with the other muscles of the body, suffers from\r\nboth the forms of degeneration above described, but the granular form\r\nappears to be more common than the waxy. In protracted cases it is\r\nusually much softened, and when thrown upon a plate no longer retains\r\nits form. It has usually lost its normal color and acquired the tint\r\ndescribed by the French as feuille morte (faded leaf). Upon minute\r\nexamination the degeneration is found to have taken place in patches,\r\nthe diseased fibres being found alongside of others which have\r\nscarcely undergone any alteration. These patches are especially common\r\nin the papillary muscles of the mitral valve--a fact which explains\r\nthe occasional presence of systolic murmurs in typhoid fever. In\r\naddition to the microscopic appearances of the muscles already\r\ndescribed, Hayem[49] has observed in his examinations of the heart a\r\ncellular infiltration of the connective tissue and a proliferation of\r\nthe muscle nuclei. These changes are sufficient in his opinion to\r\nestablish the existence of myocarditis. The same observer thinks he\r\nhas also found evidences of the frequent occurrence of endoarteritis\r\nin the multiplication of the cellular elements {268} of the internal\r\ncoat of the small arteries, which he has discovered under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Leçons cliniques sur les Manifestations cardiaques de\r\nla Fievre typhoide_, Paris, 1875.]\r\n\r\nSome discrepancy of opinion exists in regard to the condition of the\r\nblood in typhoid fever. Trousseau, for instance, speaks of it as being\r\nprofoundly altered and in a state of dissolution; Liebermeister says\r\nthat at the height of the disease the blood is very dark-colored, and\r\nthat after coagulation it presents a small and soft clot; and\r\nMurchison, that a dark, liquid condition of the blood is rarer than in\r\ntyphus, and that fine white coagula are more common. Harley too has\r\nfrequently found firm colorless clots of fibrin in the heart and roots\r\nof the great vessels in subjects dead in the third week of the\r\ndisease. Forget concludes from an examination \"of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three specimens of blood derived from patients in all stages of\r\nthe disease that an appreciable alteration of the blood in the several\r\nperiods of enteric fever cannot be accepted as a general fact; that\r\nthe blood is rarely altered in the first period; that the alteration\r\nis more marked in proportion as the disease is more advanced; that the\r\nalteration is not always in proportion to the gravity of the\r\ndisease.\"[50] I have myself seen the disorganization of the blood as\r\ncomplete in severe cases of typhoid fever which have rapidly proved\r\nfatal as in cases of diphtheria or of other malignant diseases. On the\r\nother hand, in protracted cases and during convalescence the blood is\r\noften thin and watery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Quoted by Harley, Reynolds's _System of Medicine_, vol.\r\ni.]\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are sometimes engorged with blood, sometimes pale and\r\nflabby. Under the microscope the appearances are similar to those just\r\ndescribed as occurring in the liver, and it is therefore unnecessary\r\nto refer to them more fully here. As a rule, the epithelium becomes\r\ngranular earlier and to a marked degree in the cortical than in the\r\ntubular portion. The absence of albuminuria must not always be\r\naccepted as proof of a healthy condition of the kidneys, as this\r\nsymptom has been wholly wanting in cases in which the organs have been\r\nextensively diseased.\r\n\r\nAnalogous changes have also been observed in the salivary glands and\r\npancreas, except that, according to Hoffmann, a cellular proliferation\r\nprecedes the degenerative process.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL DESCRIPTION.--The invasion of the disease is usually so\r\ngradual that it is often impossible to obtain from patients exact\r\ninformation as to the time of the beginning of their illness. Among\r\nthose who present themselves for treatment at the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital it is not uncommon to find that many have suffered for\r\nseveral days, it may be as long as a week, or even longer, before\r\ntaking to their beds, from vague feelings of discomfort, from headache\r\nmore or less intense, aching pains in the back or limbs, or from\r\nsensations of chilliness alternating with flashes of heat. In other\r\ncases derangements of the digestive system are more prominent, such as\r\nnausea, or even vomiting, diarrhoea, or irritability of the bowels.\r\nNotwithstanding these symptoms, and the indisposition to exertion\r\nengendered by them, they have frequently continued to follow their\r\nusual avocations up to the time of their application at the hospital\r\nfor admission. There is generally, however, no difficulty in\r\nrecognizing at once the nature of their disease. Upon examination the\r\npulse is found to be frequent, the respiration accelerated, the tongue\r\nfurred, the skin hot and dry, and the abdomen tympanitic.\r\n\r\n{269} Among patients whose position in life enables them to pay\r\ngreater attention to trifling symptoms than those who are compelled to\r\nseek hospital relief, opportunity is frequently afforded to the\r\nphysician to study the disease at a period less remote from its\r\ncommencement. The symptoms it presents when seen as early as the\r\nsecond day are generally of a very indefinite character. There may be\r\na feeling of malaise, headache with a tendency to giddiness, pain in\r\nthe back and limbs, a slightly coated tongue, thirst, and anorexia.\r\nThe patient may complain of chilly sensations alternating with flashes\r\nof heat, but it will rarely be found that the attack has commenced\r\nwith a decided chill. Diarrhoea may also be present at this time, or\r\nmay not supervene until later. Even in cases in which it is absent the\r\nbowels will generally act inordinately after the administration of a\r\ngentle purgative. Occasionally, the attack begins with vomiting, but\r\nthis is not, in my experience, a frequent mode of commencement. If the\r\nvisit be made in the morning, the febrile symptoms will be little\r\nmarked, the pulse being only slightly accelerated and the temperature\r\nbeing rarely more than from a half to a degree above the normal. In\r\nthe evening, however, the thermometer usually indicates a greater\r\nelevation of temperature.\r\n\r\nAt subsequent visits the same symptoms are presented. It will be\r\nobserved, however, that the fever is decidedly remittent in character,\r\nthe evening temperature being always from a degree to a degree and a\r\nhalf higher than that of the morning, while the temperature of each\r\nsucceeding day is a little higher than that of the day which preceded\r\nit. The patient is restless and wakeful at night, or sleep, when\r\nobtained, is unrefreshing and disturbed by dreams. He grows dull and\r\nslightly deaf, and although able to answer questions intelligently\r\nwhen roused, does so with an effort, and soon after lapses into his\r\nformer condition. Although obviously growing weaker every day, it is\r\nsometimes difficult to get him to take to his bed. The diarrhoea\r\ncontinues and increases in severity; the stools become watery in\r\ncharacter and ochrey-yellow in color; they may exceed six, or even\r\ntwelve, in the twenty-four hours. Epistaxis either consisting of a few\r\ndrops of blood only, or so profuse as to endanger life, may also occur\r\nduring the first week. Examination of the abdomen toward the middle or\r\nclose of the first week will almost always reveal the existence of\r\ntympany and of tenderness and gurgling in the right iliac fossa, and\r\nvery frequently also of slight enlargement of the spleen. The urine at\r\nthis stage of the disease is dense, scanty, and of high color. The\r\ntongue too will be observed to be more heavily coated than at first,\r\nand to be dryish, the fur being disposed on the middle of the dorsum\r\nof the organ, while the tip and edges are free from it and abnormally\r\nred in color. Usually, toward the close of the first week, the pulse\r\nwill be found to be between 100 and 120 in frequency. It often,\r\nhowever, does not attain this frequency, and in some cases does not\r\nexceed 50 throughout the whole of the attack. At the same time, the\r\nthermometer generally indicates a temperature of from 102° to 104°,\r\nand in bad cases even one much higher than the latter.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms are not pathognomonic, but Murchison regards their\r\nexistence in a young person as warranting the suspicion that he is\r\nsuffering from this disease. About this time, however, or, to speak\r\nmore accurately, usually from the seventh to the twelfth day, a new\r\nsymptom occurs {270} which is more characteristic. This is an eruption\r\nof isolated rose-colored spots, the tâches roses lenticulaires of\r\nLouis, occurring principally upon the surface of the abdomen, but not\r\ninfrequently seen also upon the chest, back, limbs, and even,\r\naccording to some authors, upon the face. They are round in shape,\r\nwith a well-defined margin, usually about a line in diameter, but\r\nsometimes considerably larger, slightly elevated above the surface,\r\nand disappearing upon pressure, but returning when the pressure is\r\nremoved. They can almost always be found at this stage of the disease\r\nif diligently sought for.\r\n\r\nIf the disease tends to run a severe course, all the symptoms become\r\naggravated toward the end of the second week. The tongue grows dry and\r\nbrown, the pulse more frequent, feeble, and markedly reduplicated in\r\ncharacter, the diarrhoea still more severe, and the fever higher than\r\nbefore, with little or no tendency to remit in the morning. The\r\nnervous symptoms also come into prominence. The headache may grow more\r\nviolent or may be replaced by increased dulness, which may sometimes\r\nbe so decided as to render it difficult to fully rouse the patient. At\r\nother times delirium is a prominent symptom. This may only occur at\r\nnight, but not infrequently is observed during the daytime as well. It\r\nis usually more active in character than that which accompanies\r\ntyphus. Trembling of the tongue and of the limbs is not uncommon at\r\nthis time. The urine becomes more abundant, paler, and less dense than\r\nbefore. Even in cases characterized by symptoms as severe as those\r\nabove detailed some improvement is, however, often observed to take\r\nplace between the fourteenth and twenty-first days. The morning\r\nremission becomes more decided, the evening temperature less high than\r\nthat of the preceding day; the stools lessen in number, and gradually\r\nassume a more healthy appearance; the pulse diminishes in frequency\r\nand gains in force; the tongue becomes moist, and shows a tendency to\r\nthrow off its fur; the trembling grows less marked; the dulness and\r\ndelirium lessen; and the patient falls into a refreshing sleep. In\r\nother cases, in many of which recovery eventually takes place, there\r\nis at this time, instead of an improvement, a still further\r\naggravation of the symptoms. The pulse becomes more feeble and\r\nfrequent; the tongue is not only excessively dry and brown, but\r\nshrivelled and fissured; the lips and teeth are encrusted with sordes;\r\nthe stools contain shreds of membrane, and often blood; the subsultus\r\ntendinum increases; carphololgia, or picking at the bed-clothes,\r\noccurs. The prostration becomes so extreme that the patient frequently\r\nslips down in bed from sheer weakness. The active delirium of the\r\nprevious stage is replaced by the low muttering form, or the patient\r\nlies upon his back with his eyes half closed in a semi-unconscious\r\ncondition, from which he is with difficulty aroused, and which may\r\ndeepen into coma. Occasionally, however, the active delirium\r\ncontinues, and is associated with an obstinate wakefulness; the urine\r\nand feces are passed involuntarily, or, with an apparent incontinence\r\nof the former, there may be retention, which is very apt to be\r\noverlooked. If these symptoms continue for any length of time,\r\nbed-sores may form not only over the sacrum, but on other parts\r\nsubject to pressure, and the patient, worn out by long-continued\r\nsuffering, dies from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in the midst of these symptoms, and sometimes even in\r\ncases in which the condition is not so alarming, prostration\r\napproaching {271} collapse, without obvious cause, suddenly\r\nsupervenes. The pulse becomes a mere thread, the surface is bathed in\r\na clammy sweat, and the temperature is found to have fallen from four\r\nto seven degrees, and in some cases even more. These symptoms almost\r\nalways indicate that intestinal hemorrhage has taken place, and are\r\nfollowed by the discharge of blood either in the course of a few hours\r\nor not until a day or two subsequently. If the hemorrhage be moderate\r\nin amount, and does not recur, reaction usually takes place in a short\r\ntime; but if, on the other hand, it is profuse or frequently repeated,\r\ndeath may occur, either immediately or later, as the result of the\r\nexhaustion it has induced. Very much the same set of symptoms attend\r\nthe occurrence of perforation of the bowel, an accident which is also\r\nliable to happen in the course of typhoid fever, but which may\r\ngenerally be distinguished from intestinal hemorrhage by its being\r\naccompanied by a sharp pain in the abdomen, which is frequently so\r\nsevere as to cause the patient to cry out, by its not being attended\r\nwith the same reduction of temperature, and by the absence of blood in\r\nthe discharges. In a day or two all doubt will be set at rest, if the\r\ncase be one of perforation, by the occurrence of general peritonitis.\r\n\r\nA fatal termination is by no means the usual result, even in cases in\r\nwhich the disease has assumed its worst features. Indeed, it may be\r\nsaid that there is no condition in typhoid fever so grave that\r\nrecovery from it is impossible. Many authors would make perforation of\r\nthe bowel an exception to this general rule, but there are\r\nobservations on record which would seem to show that this accident is\r\nnot invariably fatal. Even in cases in which the patient has lain\r\nhelplessly on his back in a semi-unconscious or comatose condition,\r\npassing his discharges under him, the physician will often be\r\ngratified to find at one of his visits some evidence of improvement,\r\ntrifling as it will probably be. It may be only a slight change of\r\nposition, an inconsiderable fall of temperature, or a scarcely\r\nappreciable moistening of the tongue; but these changes, insignificant\r\nas they apparently are, are sufficient to indicate to the practised\r\neye of the observant physician the approach of convalescence. Next day\r\nthere will be a still further reduction of temperature, a more decided\r\nmoistening of the tongue, a sensible diminution of the nervous\r\nsymptoms, and a reduction in the frequency of pulse. In this\r\ncondition, however, as may be readily imagined, convalescence may be\r\nretarded by numerous accidents, and life may hang trembling in the\r\nbalance for several days, or even weeks, before it is fully\r\nestablished. It is not necessary to recount here the various steps by\r\nwhich a return to health is reached, as they are essentially the same\r\nas those which mark the convalescence of the less severe variety of\r\nthe disease, and have already been fully referred to in the\r\ndescription of that form.\r\n\r\nBut even after the establishment of convalescence, and after the\r\npatient has been free from fever for several days, febrile attacks\r\nlasting for a day or two, or even longer, may occur as the consequence\r\nof very slight causes, such as undue excitement, or fatigue of any\r\nkind, or the immoderate indulgence of the appetite, which in this\r\ncondition frequently needs to be restrained. These attacks are usually\r\nspoken of as recrudescences of fever, and do not differ materially\r\nfrom attacks of irritative fever occurring under other circumstances.\r\nThey usually subside under appropriate treatment with the removal of\r\ntheir cause, but leave the patient somewhat {272} weaker than they\r\nfound him. In other cases, it may be a week or ten days after the fall\r\nof the temperature to the normal, and frequently at a time when all\r\ndanger seems to have been passed, a true relapse of the disease\r\noccurs. In this, of course, all the symptoms of the primary attack are\r\nreproduced, including even the eruption of rose-colored spots. The\r\ntemperature usually, however, attains the maximum more rapidly, and\r\nthe duration of the fever is generally shorter, than that of the\r\noriginal attack. A second relapse is also not very uncommon, and even\r\na third may occur. Various complications and sequelæ also occur in the\r\ncourse of typhoid fever, which will be referred to fully hereafter.\r\n\r\nAnother form of the disease, which it may be well to allude to briefly\r\nhere before closing the general description of the disease, is the\r\nabortive form. In this variety the attack begins and runs its course\r\nup to a certain point, including often even the occurrence of the\r\neruption, as it does in the majority of cases; but at a period which\r\nvaries between the seventh and fourteenth day the symptoms suddenly\r\nsubside and the patient rapidly convalesces. In some cases it may be\r\ndifficult to distinguish this form from an attack of simple continued\r\nfever, and, in fact, in cases in which the eruption is absent it will\r\nbe impossible, unless other cases of typhoid fever have occurred in\r\nthe same house or family, or unless the patient has been unmistakably\r\nexposed to the influences under which the disease arises.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the disease begins abruptly with a chill, intense\r\nheadache, or with gastro-intestinal symptoms, which have in rare\r\ninstances been so violent as to have suggested to the mind of the\r\nattending physician the possibility of corrosive poisoning. This,\r\naccording to Chomel, is the most frequent mode of commencement, but\r\nhis experience on this point is opposed to that of the great majority\r\nof observers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to describe in detail some of the most important\r\nof the symptoms presented by the disease.\r\n\r\nEven in the beginning of an attack of typhoid fever the face has a\r\nlistless and languid expression, although the eyes are usually bright\r\nand the pupils dilated. In mild cases no further alteration of the\r\nphysiognomy than this may be noticeable throughout the whole course of\r\nthe disease, but in bad cases, when the typhoid condition is fully\r\ndeveloped, the expression becomes dull and heavy. There is, however,\r\nnever the general suffusion of the face seen in typhus. On the\r\ncontrary, the face is often pallid, or there is at most a\r\ncircumscribed flush on one or both cheeks, which is most marked during\r\nthe exacerbations of fever or after the administration of food and\r\nstimulants. During convalescence the effects of the long illness are\r\nfully visible in the face.\r\n\r\nProstration, or loss of muscular strength, is present from the\r\nbeginning in a large number of cases of typhoid fever, but is\r\ngenerally not so marked in the early stages as in typhus fever. It is\r\nusually most intense in grave cases, but to this rule there are\r\nnumerous exceptions. It is not rare to find patients, in whom the\r\nother symptoms are severe, able to sit up in bed, and even to rise to\r\nstool, throughout the attack. Bartlett records a case in which the\r\npatient did not confine herself to bed until the occurrence of\r\nperforation, and I have had under my care a man who, supposing he was\r\nsuffering only from a slight diarrhoea, performed the duties {273} of\r\na nurse in a military hospital until two days before his death,\r\nalthough the autopsy showed very extensive ulceration of the\r\nintestine. Several cases have come under my care in the second week in\r\nwhich patients have walked a considerable distance to make application\r\nfor admission to a hospital. Generally, however, the prostration\r\nbecomes extreme in the third and fourth weeks of bad cases, the\r\npatient lying helplessly on his back, and frequently slipping down in\r\nbed from sheer weakness.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis may occur at any stage of typhoid fever, but is most common\r\nin the forming stage. Observers differ in opinion in regard to its\r\nfrequency. Murchison noted it in only 15 of 58 cases, and gives it as\r\nhis belief that it is more common in France than in England or this\r\ncountry. Flint found that it had occurred in 21 only of 73 cases, and\r\nJenner in 5 of 15 fatal cases. On the other hand, Bartlett says that\r\nit is quite a common symptom, and Wood and Gerhard, from the frequency\r\nwith which they had met with it in the beginning of the disease, were\r\naccustomed to regard its presence as of importance in a diagnostic\r\npoint of view. Part of this divergence of opinion is probably due to\r\nthe fact that it is usually small in amount, and therefore very apt to\r\nbe overlooked. I have in many cases, after having been told there had\r\nbeen no epistaxis, found the evidence of it upon the fingers or\r\nbed-clothes of the patient. It may, however, be so profuse as to\r\nendanger life and render necessary the use of the tampon. Except in\r\nthe latter case it is without influence upon the course of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe skin may be almost constantly dry as well as warm throughout the\r\nwhole course of the fever in a small proportion of severe cases. But,\r\non the whole, perspiration occurs with greater frequency in typhoid\r\nfever than in any other acute disease, unless it be rheumatism. It\r\ntakes place most commonly at night after the evening exacerbation, or\r\nin the morning when the patient awakes from sleep, but it is not very\r\nrare to find the skin clammy at other times. The sweating is usually\r\ngeneral, but in a few cases it is local only. When colliquative, it is\r\nfrequently exhausting, and is then a grave symptom. It is sometimes\r\nprolonged into convalescence, when it is not only annoying, but in\r\nconsequence of the prostration it induces may sometimes retard the\r\nrestoration to health.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to satisfy myself that any peculiar odor is\r\ngiven off by the skin in typhoid fever, and most observers make a\r\nsimilar statement. Chomel, however, asserted that the perspiration has\r\na strong acid odor, and Bartlett agreed with Nathan Smith in thinking\r\nthat typhoid fever patients exhale a peculiar odor, not pungent and\r\nammoniacal, like that of typhus, but \"of a semi-cadaverous and musty\r\ncharacter,\" which is especially noticeable during the later stages of\r\nsevere and fatal cases.\r\n\r\nThe eruption is one of the most characteristic symptoms of the\r\ndisease. Indeed, in many cases, without it the diagnosis would be\r\nimpossible. It is rarely absent in a well-developed case. Murchison\r\nsays that it was noted in 4606 cases only out of 5988 admitted into\r\nthe London Fever Hospital in twenty-three years, but admits that it\r\nwould probably have been found in some of the others if it had been\r\nproperly looked for. Wood says that he has seldom met with cases in\r\nwhich it was absent. It is oftener absent in children than adults--a\r\ncircumstance which makes the diagnosis of the disease in the former\r\noften a matter of great difficulty. It consists of isolated\r\nrose-colored spots, slightly elevated above {274} the surface,\r\ncircular in form or nearly so, having well-defined margins, usually\r\nabout a line in diameter, but sometimes varying from half a line to\r\ntwo and even three lines in diameter, and disappearing on pressure, to\r\nreturn when the pressure is removed. They are generally first observed\r\nsome time between the seventh and fourteenth days, but cases are on\r\nrecord, especially in children, in which they are said to have\r\nappeared much earlier, and others in which they could not be\r\ndiscovered until the twentieth day. In the latter cases, however, it\r\nis not improbable they had really been present at an earlier period,\r\nbut had escaped detection. The eruption occurs in crops at intervals\r\nof three or four days, each spot lasting from three to five days, and\r\nthe whole duration of the eruption being usually from ten to twenty,\r\nand varying of course with the severity of the attack. It may continue\r\nto appear as late as the twentieth day, and in cases of relapses very\r\nmuch later. Spots are sometimes seen on the abdomen or elsewhere after\r\nthe subsidence of fever, and whenever seen indicate that the diseased\r\nprocess is not at an end. They are usually scattered over the lower\r\npart of the front of the chest and the abdomen, but are also not\r\ninfrequently met with upon the back, and if they are not found upon\r\nthe abdomen, the patient should be gently turned upon his side and\r\nthis part of his body carefully examined. When very abundant they are\r\noften also seen upon the extremities, and occasionally even upon the\r\nface. Wood has seen them abundant on the upper and inner part of the\r\nthigh, and confined to that place. When tardy in making their\r\nappearance, they may often be brought out by application of a mustard\r\nplaster or by that of heat in any form; and it is probably, therefore,\r\nowing in large measure to the warmth of the bed that they are often so\r\nfully developed upon the back. In number they may vary from two or\r\nthree to several hundred. In one case Murchison counted one thousand,\r\nand in three cases which came under my care in the winter of 1881-82\r\nthe body was so thickly covered by spots of an unusually large size\r\nthat when I first saw the patients I directed them to be isolated\r\nunder the fear that the disease would prove to be typhus fever. When\r\nvery numerous the edges of two or three of the spots may run together,\r\ngiving the eruption an irregular character. No relation between the\r\ncopiousness of the eruption and the severity of the disease has ever\r\nbeen proved to exist. While the prevailing impression, therefore, that\r\ncases in which the eruption is freely developed are apt to be of a\r\nmild character, is true in many instances, it is by no means so in\r\nall. The three cases above referred to all ran a severe course, and\r\none of them proved fatal. The spots disappear after death, and are\r\nrarely converted into petechiæ, but in bad cases I have seen purpura\r\nspots, and even vibices, developed independently of them. Sometimes\r\nthe appearance of the eruption is preceded for a day or two by a\r\ndelicate scarlet rash, which Tweedie says resembles roseola and has\r\nbeen mistaken for scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nSudamina, so called from their resemblance to sweat-drops, also occur\r\nnot infrequently in this disease. They are minute vesicles, often not\r\nlarger than a pin's head, but sometimes two lines in diameter, and\r\noccasionally, in cases in which two or three have coalesced, much\r\nlarger. They usually contain at first a clear serum, which may,\r\nhowever, subsequently become turbid, and when very minute must, in\r\nconsequence of {275} their transparency, be viewed obliquely to be\r\nseen. Frequently, when they cannot be distinguished by the eye, they\r\nare readily detected by the touch. They rarely occur before the\r\ntwelfth day, and often not before the close of the third week. Their\r\nmost usual seat is the neck, the folds of the axillæ, and the groin,\r\nbut there is no part of the body except the face in which they may not\r\noccur. They are most frequently seen in those cases attended by\r\nprofuse sweating, and are by no means peculiar to typhoid fever, but\r\nare met with in other diseases--as, for instance, acute\r\nrheumatism--which are attended by this symptom. They are generally\r\nfollowed by branny desquamation of the cuticle in the position they\r\nhave occupied.\r\n\r\nSpots of a delicate blue tint--the \"tâches bleuâtres\" of French\r\nwriters--are sometimes observed on the skin in cases of enteric fever.\r\nThey must be of infrequent occurrence in this country, for, although I\r\nhave looked carefully for them in every case that has come under my\r\ncare, I have rarely been able to detect them. According to Murchison,\r\n\"they are of an irregularly rounded form and from three to eight lines\r\nin diameter. They are not in the least elevated above the skin, nor\r\naffected by pressure, even at their first appearance. They have a\r\nuniform tint throughout their extent, and they never pass through the\r\nsuccessive stages observed in the spots of typhus. Two or three of\r\nthem are sometimes confluent. They are most common on the abdomen,\r\nback, and thighs.\" They are said in some cases to be distributed along\r\nthe course of the small cutaneous veins, and to occur most frequently\r\nin cases which are mild. They are met with in other diseases, and\r\nusually precede in appearance the characteristic eruption of typhoid\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThe hair is very apt to fall out after an attack of typhoid fever. The\r\nnails suffer in their nutrition in common with other parts of the\r\nbody--a fact which may be recognized by the peculiar markings which\r\nare found upon them after recovery, and to which attention has been\r\nparticularly drawn by Morris Longstreth in a paper in the\r\n_Transactions_ of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, vol.\r\niii., 3d Series.\r\n\r\nThe circulation is usually accelerated from the beginning of an attack\r\nof typhoid fever. The degree of acceleration is commonly proportioned\r\nto the severity of the other symptoms, and especially to the elevation\r\nof the temperature, and is generally more marked in the evening than\r\nin the morning. It is subject, however, to numerous variations, not\r\nonly in different cases, but even in the same case from day to day,\r\nand even from hour to hour. Murchison refers to a case in which the\r\npulse sank to 37, and never exceeded 56 during the fever, although it\r\nrose to 66 during the convalescence. I have never had the opportunity\r\nmyself of observing such an infrequent pulse in the febrile period of\r\nthe disease, but have had cases under my care in which the pulse often\r\nfell below 60, and in which it never exceeded 80 until after the\r\ncommencement of convalescence. A comparatively infrequent pulse may\r\ncoexist with a high temperature. Thus, for example, a pulse of 80 was\r\nnoted in one of my cases at the same time that the thermometer showed\r\nthat the temperature was 105°, and on another occasion in the same\r\ncase the pulse was 82 and the temperature 104-1/2°. As a rule, the\r\npulse is more frequent in cases which terminate fatally than in those\r\nwhich end in recovery; but to this rule there are numerous exceptions.\r\nIn eight of Louis's cases it never {276} went above 90, and in some of\r\nmy own it did not reach 100 on more than one or two occasions. On the\r\nother hand, in mild cases the pulse may be exceedingly frequent,\r\nreaching, and even exceeding in many cases, 120. When the disease is\r\nprolonged and the prostration is extreme, a pulse of from 140 to 150\r\nis not uncommon. In the majority of cases which have come under my\r\ncare the pulse has varied in frequency from 80 to 120. In some cases\r\nthe range has been between these two figures, in others it has been\r\nvery much less.\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence the pulse usually gradually diminishes in\r\nfrequency, and may sometimes fall below the normal standard. I have\r\nknown it in a few instances to fall to 38, and have often met with\r\npulses ranging between 40 and 60 at this period. In other cases, on\r\nthe contrary, the pulse continues frequent during convalescence, or\r\nreadily becomes so after a slight exertion or excitement of any kind.\r\nA slow pulse during convalescence has been in my experience most\r\nfrequent in men whose health previous to the attack was good, and a\r\nfrequent pulse in women and delicate men. If the convalescence is\r\nretarded by a complication, the pulse will maintain its frequency\r\nuntil this is removed.\r\n\r\nThe pulse will of course present other changes than those above\r\nreferred to. It is in the beginning firm and full, but after the first\r\nweek becomes small and compressible, and acquires the peculiarity\r\nknown as reduplication. Sometimes, when this is not well developed, it\r\nwill be rendered quite distinct by elevating the patient's arm.\r\nIrregularity or intermission of the pulse, although not commonly\r\nobserved in this disease, occasionally occurs. The heart's action will\r\nalso be observed to grow feeble in the course of severe cases, and its\r\nfirst sound indistinct, but neither of these changes is as marked in\r\ntyphoid as in typhus fever. Hayem asserts that in a certain number of\r\ncases a systolic bellows murmur, with its point of greatest intensity\r\nat the apex, is heard during the course or at the close of the second\r\nweek. This murmur is sometimes soft in the beginning, but becomes\r\nharsh and intense later, or may have these characters from the start\r\nto such a degree as to give the impression that endocarditis exists.\r\nDuring convalescence an anæmic murmur is not infrequently present.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory movements are accelerated in typhoid fever, as they\r\nare in all febrile conditions, independently of any disease of the\r\nlungs, and their frequency is generally proportional to that of the\r\npulse. In looking over my records of cases I find that the former are\r\nless liable to fluctuate from day to day than the pulse, and that when\r\nthe latter becomes abnormally infrequent they do not sink below the\r\nstandard of health. In several cases of which I have notes the\r\nrespiration was from 20 to 28, while the pulse was below 60, and in a\r\ncase referred to by Murchison the pulse was 42 at the same time that\r\nthe respirations, although no pulmonary lesion could be discovered,\r\nwere 48. The respiration is often, as in the case just alluded to,\r\nvery much accelerated when the most careful examination of the chest\r\nwill not lead to the detection of any disease there. This is sometimes\r\nthe consequence of very great tympanites, which, by interfering with\r\nthe descent of the diaphragm, gives rise to dyspnoea, but it may also\r\noccur as a purely nervous phenomenon. The air expired by patients has\r\nbeen examined, and has {277} been found sometimes, in the later stages\r\nof the disease, to contain ammonia.\r\n\r\nBronchitis is so common an accompaniment of typhoid fever that\r\nauscultation rarely fails to reveal its presence in some form or\r\nother. In some cases there may be only slight harshness of the\r\nrespiratory murmur at the base of the chest, but in a large number of\r\ncases the auscultatory signs will be sonorous, sibilant, and mucous\r\nrâles. The last named may be so numerous that I have known the disease\r\nin the beginning mistaken for acute bronchitis, and even acute\r\nphthisis, by accomplished diagnosticians.\r\n\r\nHeadache is one of the most constant symptoms of typhoid fever.\r\nBartlett says that it is rarely absent, Louis found it in all but 7 of\r\n133 cases, and Jackson noted it in nearly all his cases. It is often\r\nthe first symptom of which the patient complains, and, when not\r\npresent at the beginning of the attack, makes its appearance soon\r\nafter. It is almost as common, although less severe, in mild cases as\r\nin grave ones. It sometimes persists throughout the attack, but\r\noftener subsides at the close of the first week or toward the middle\r\nof the second, or the patient may cease to complain of it in\r\nconsequence of the dulness which is very apt to supervene. It is\r\nusually referred to the forehead and temples, but may extend over the\r\nwhole head. It is usually dull and heavy, but in a few cases is\r\nthrobbing. It is said by authors rarely to be severe, but I have known\r\nit so intense and acute as to cause the disease at its commencement to\r\nbe mistaken for meningitis, and Jackson asserted that it is sometimes\r\nso severe that local bloodletting, and even venesection, had to be\r\nemployed for its relief. It would appear to be as common in children\r\nas adults.\r\n\r\nThe headache is sometimes accompanied by vertigo and dizziness, and\r\neven by retraction of the head. Distressing pains in the back and\r\nlimbs may also occur, and in rare cases even contraction of the hands\r\nand feet.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of an attack of typhoid fever the patient usually\r\nsuffers from wakefulness and restlessness at night, and it\r\noccasionally happens that the wakefulness becomes a distressing\r\nsymptom. But in a great many cases, sooner or later in the course of\r\nthe disease, drowsiness supervenes. In mild cases this symptom is late\r\nin making its appearance, and is generally slight and evanescent, but\r\nin grave cases it may come on as early as the eighth day, and when\r\nonce present may gradually become more profound until it deepens at\r\nlast into unconsciousness. It usually persists until the occurrence of\r\ndeath or of convalescence, but may alternate with periods of delirium,\r\nthe delirium being more frequent at night and the somnolence by day.\r\nIt is as frequent in children as in adults. Occasionally, the\r\nwakefulness of the earlier stage may reappear at the beginning of the\r\nthird week, and coexist with muttering delirium, or occasionally with\r\ndelirium of a more violent character. It then constitutes a most\r\nunfavorable symptom, the patient frequently passing several days and\r\nnights in incessant agitation, and sinking finally from exhaustion due\r\nto want of sleep.\r\n\r\nSome degree of mental hebetude is rarely absent, even in the mildest\r\ncases of typhoid fever, and is usually among its earliest symptoms. It\r\nmay, however, be absent occasionally in cases which run a severe\r\ncourse. It exhibits itself in the beginning in an indisposition to be\r\ndisturbed, a slight inability to fix the thoughts, or a loss of\r\nmemory. Generally, the {278} patient will be able at first, by an\r\neffort, to rouse himself from this apathy, but the moment he relaxes\r\nthis effort will lapse into his former condition. As the disease\r\nprogresses the hebetude becomes more profound and is overcome with\r\ngreater difficulty. In mild cases it may continue until the occurrence\r\nof convalescence, but in grave cases it is soon lost in delirium. This\r\nis one of the commonest symptoms of the disease. If I should rely\r\nsolely upon my own experience, I should say that it was rare for any\r\nbut the mildest cases to run their course without its occurring at\r\nsome time or other. Louis found, however, that it was absent in 32\r\ncases, 8 of which were fatal, out of 134 cases, and Murchison in 33\r\ncases, 3 of which ended in death, out of 100 cases. In 8 of these\r\nfatal cases death was due to perforation--a fact which would seem to\r\nshow, as suggested by James C. Wilson, that this symptom is not\r\ndependent upon the intensity of the local disease alone. The delirium\r\nof course varies with the severity of the other symptoms, and\r\nespecially with the intensity of the fever. In its mildest form it\r\nconsists of a slight confusion of ideas, which is readily dissipated\r\nby fixing the patient's attention, and is most apt to occur in the\r\nnight or when he first wakes up from sleep. In other cases it is much\r\nmore marked; occasionally it is violent and noisy; the patient may\r\ntalk wildly and incoherently, he may break out into a paroxysm of\r\nscreaming, or, possessed with a sudden terror, he may leave his bed\r\nand attempt to rush from the room or to jump from the window. Later in\r\nthe course of the disease the active delirium subsides, and low\r\nmuttering delirium takes its place. The latter may go on until\r\nconvalescence occurs, or the patient may gradually fall into a\r\ncomatose condition, which very often ends in death.\r\n\r\nThe delusions from which the patient suffers are various. I have known\r\nin two instances a perfectly pure young girl call loudly for her baby,\r\nwhich she accused her mother and sister of keeping from her. Very\r\nfrequently patients insist that they are in a strange place, and beg\r\npiteously to be taken to their home and friends; occasionally, in\r\ngrave cases, the patient declares that there is nothing the matter\r\nwith him. This Louis was accustomed to regard as a bad symptom, having\r\nnever known recovery to take place after it. Delirium generally first\r\nmakes its appearance some time in the course of the second week, but\r\noccasionally the invasion of the disease is marked by maniacal\r\nexcitement. I have known delirium to occur on the second or third day.\r\nLouis records two cases in which it was present during the first\r\nnight, and Bristowe[51] one in which it was noted on the fourth night.\r\nIt is sometimes so prominent a symptom in the beginning of an attack\r\nthat the patient has at first been supposed to be affected with acute\r\nmania. M. Motet[52] indeed refers to a case in which a man was\r\nactually admitted into an insane asylum before the true nature of his\r\ndisease became known. On the other hand, delirium may not occur until\r\nmuch later in the disease--sometimes not before the close of the third\r\nor even the fourth week, when it may suddenly make its appearance when\r\nleast expected. I have known it to be present in a marked degree\r\nduring a relapse when it had been wholly wanting in the primary\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Trans. Path. Soc. Lond._, vol. xiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Archiv. gén. de Méd._, 1868, quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence, especially in cases in which there has been much\r\n{279} mental disturbance during the febrile period, the intellect may\r\nbe weak, and continues so in some cases even after recovery in other\r\nrespects is complete; but it is rarely permanently impaired. Insanity\r\nmay also occur during the convalescence or after recovery, but it is\r\nusually under these circumstances amenable to treatment. In some cases\r\nthe moral sense appears to be weakened after an attack, as in the case\r\nreported by Nathan Smith, in which a young man of previously good\r\nhabits developed thieving propensities after his recovery.\r\n\r\nHyperæsthesia of the skin exists, according to Murchison, in about 5\r\nper cent. of the cases, and may occur at any stage of the disease. It\r\nis chiefly observed in the abdomen and lower extremities, and is more\r\nfrequently met with in women and children than in adult males. In a\r\ncase which was partially under my care during the past summer the\r\nslightest touch made the patient, a boy of fifteen years, cry out with\r\npain, and the administration of an enema gave him excruciating agony.\r\nOccasionally, the tenderness over the abdomen is so great that it is\r\nsometimes difficult to distinguish it from that due to peritonitis,\r\nexcept by the coexistence of hyperæsthesia in other parts of the body.\r\nIt is very often associated with spinal tenderness, and sometimes with\r\nother spinal symptoms. Murchison does not regard it as a formidable\r\nsymptom.\r\n\r\nCutaneous anæsthesia may also occur, but it is certainly less common\r\nin the earlier stages than hyperæsthesia. Rilliet and Barthez look\r\nupon it as of grave diagnostic import when it occurs in children.\r\n\r\nMuscular tremor is also a common symptom of typhoid fever. A little\r\ntremulousness of the tongue when protruded may often be detected\r\nbefore the close of the first week. A little later the hands will be\r\nobserved to tremble when held up, and still later twitching of the\r\ntendons at the wrist may be appreciable while the pulse is being felt.\r\nWhen muttering delirium supervenes this subsultus tendinum becomes\r\nconstant, and extends to other parts of the body. The hands of the\r\npatient are frequently then in constant motion, either picking at the\r\nbed-clothes--a very unfavorable symptom--or moving in an objectless\r\nmanner through the air. This condition presents many points of\r\nresemblance to that often seen in delirium tremens, and is said to\r\ncome on earlier and to be more marked in those who are addicted to the\r\nabuse of alcoholic liquors. Hiccough is occasionally observed toward\r\nthe close of grave cases, and is justly regarded as a bad symptom.\r\n\r\nSpasmodic contraction of various groups of muscles is occasionally\r\nobserved in severe cases, but is less frequent than muscular tremor,\r\nand in my experience is generally met with in the earliest period of\r\nthe disease. The muscles of the extremities, especially those of the\r\nlegs, are oftenest affected, but I have known the head as rigidly\r\nretracted as in tubercular meningitis, and have seen cases in which\r\nstrabismus has been an early symptom. Murchison has had patients under\r\nhis care who have suffered from constriction of the pharynx to such an\r\nextent that they could not swallow. He also reports cases in which\r\ntrismus and spasm of the glottis have been present. General\r\nconvulsions are not common, but occasionally do occur. Although a very\r\ngrave symptom, they are not invariably fatal. Recovery took place in\r\none of two cases which came under my own observation, and in four of\r\nthe six recorded by Murchison. They are not always associated with an\r\nalbuminous {280} condition of the urine. In neither of my cases was\r\nthere albuminuria, and in only one of the four of Murchison's cases in\r\nwhich the urine was examined was it present. In one of my cases--the\r\nfatal one--the convulsions seemed to have been induced by giving the\r\npatient improper food; in the other no cause could be discovered.\r\n\r\nRinging or buzzing noises in the ears are present in the early stage\r\nof the disease in a large proportion of the cases, and may sometimes\r\npersist until the disease is well advanced. Usually, however, after a\r\nfew days they subside and give place to deafness. This is a very\r\ncommon symptom, and may either affect both ears or be limited to one.\r\nIn the former case it is probably generally due to the blunted\r\nperceptions of the patient, although in a few instances it may be\r\ncaused, as suggested by Trousseau, by inflammation of the Eustachian\r\ntube. When only one ear is affected the deafness is of more serious\r\nimport, as it is then dependent upon the presence of local\r\ninflammation, which may possibly extend to the meninges. It is, as a\r\nrule, most marked in the severest cases. Unless there has been a local\r\ninflammation it is not followed by permanent impairment of the\r\nhearing. It has even been regarded by some observers as a favorable\r\nsymptom, but this opinion does not appear to rest upon a more\r\nsubstantial basis than the observation of Louis, that the most\r\nprofound deafness adds nothing to the gravity of the prognosis.\r\n\r\nImperfect or perverted vision occasionally occurs in the course of\r\ntyphoid fever. In a case which was recently under my care, and which\r\nhas already been referred to in another connection, there was double\r\nvision associated with strabismus. Sometimes haziness of vision, and\r\nsometimes even visual illusions, are observed. Bartlett and Murchison\r\nhave often known intolerance of light present in cases characterized\r\nby active febrile excitement. As a general rule, the pupils are widely\r\ndilated and the conjunctiva pearly white--a condition which is in\r\nmarked contrast with what is seen in typhus fever. When, however,\r\nstupor supervenes in bad cases, the pupils are frequently as much\r\ncontracted and the conjunctivæ as much injected as in the latter\r\ndisease. In a few cases unequal dilatation of the pupils has been\r\nnoticed. Trousseau was accustomed in his clinical lectures to call\r\nattention to the frequency with which sloughing of the cornea occurred\r\nin the condition known as coma vigil, in which the patient lies with\r\nhis eyes wide open. He attributed this accident to the fact that the\r\neye in this condition is not kept constantly moist by the occasional\r\nclosure of the eyelids, and hence, as its innervation is also\r\nimpaired, is especially prone to take on ulcerative inflammation. In\r\nother cases there is a free secretion of viscid matter, which often\r\nglues the eyelids together.\r\n\r\nThe sense of taste is often lost or perverted. This is partly due to\r\nimpaired innervation of the tongue and palate, and partly to the thick\r\ndeposits which usually cover the mucous membrane of these organs.\r\n\r\nFrequent observations of the temperature in typhoid fever not merely\r\ngive most important information in a diagnostic and prognostic point\r\nof view, but also often furnish valuable indications for treatment.\r\nFrom a close study of a large number of cases, Wunderlich and other\r\nphysicians have discovered that the pyrexia has certain characters\r\nwhich distinguish it from other fevers, and which, being present in a\r\ncase in which the other symptoms are obscure or ill defined, will\r\noften enable us to recognize {281} its true nature. The pyrexia may be\r\ndivided into three periods, each having its own peculiarities. It is\r\nusually said that each period lasts about a week, but in severe cases\r\nthe second and third periods extend over a longer time than this, and\r\nthe occurrence of a complication or of any other disturbing influence\r\nwill have its effect in producing either a prolongation of any one or\r\nmore of these periods, and especially of the last two, or an unwonted\r\nelevation or fall of temperature. During the first period there is a\r\nprogressive rise of temperature, but the rise is never so abrupt as in\r\ntyphus or in many of the phlegmasiæ. As there are morning remissions,\r\nranging from a degree to two degrees in extent, corresponding to the\r\nmorning fall in the daily variations of temperature, the tracing upon\r\nthe temperature chart will be a zigzag line, each evening temperature\r\nbeing from a degree and a half to two degrees higher than that of the\r\npreceding evening, while the same difference will be observed in the\r\nmorning temperature. The temperature ought, therefore, never in an\r\nuncomplicated case to be much over 100° on the first evening or 102°\r\non the second. A temperature of 104° at any time during the first or\r\nsecond day will consequently exclude typhoid fever from the diagnosis.\r\nFrom six to eight days are usually occupied before the maximum is\r\nreached. I have seen it attained as early as the fourth day in mild\r\ncases, and, on the other hand, not until much later in severe ones. It\r\nis usually 104° or 105°, but will of course vary with the gravity of\r\nthe other symptoms. The temperature rarely rises higher than 106° at\r\nthis period. On the other hand, I have known cases in which it never\r\nexceeded 103° during their whole course. It would therefore be wrong\r\nto exclude typhoid fever from the diagnosis, as Wunderlich does, if\r\nthis temperature is not reached by the sixth, or at latest the eighth,\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Chart of typical range of temperature in\r\ntyphoid fever, after Wunderlich.]\r\n\r\nIn the next period the temperature usually ceases to rise, but has a\r\ntendency to oscillate about the maximum temperature of the previous\r\nperiod as a fixed point, occasionally not quite reaching it, at other\r\ntimes rising a little above it. The morning remissions, too, become\r\nless decided. In other words, the fever now becomes continuous. This\r\nperiod, although usually lasting about a week, may extend over more\r\nthan two weeks, even in the absence of complications, in cases which\r\nrun a severe course, and when it is prolonged from this cause the\r\ntemperature may again show a tendency to rise, and may even attain an\r\nelevation considerably above that of the preceding period. The\r\nprognosis in all such cases in which the temperature rises after the\r\nmiddle of the second week is grave. Temperatures of 108°, and even of\r\n110.3°, have been noted at this time. Death invariably follows such\r\nhigh temperatures as these, but before death actually occurs a\r\nconsiderable fall of temperature very often takes place. Wunderlich\r\nhas also called attention to the fact that it is not uncommon for a\r\nsudden and temporary remission of temperature to take place at this\r\nstage, varying from one degree to two degrees and a half, which may\r\nlast from ten to twelve hours, and which usually has occurred in his\r\nexperience from the sixteenth to the eighteenth day. Toward the close\r\nof the second period the morning remissions will be observed to be\r\nmore decided, while the evening temperature remains about the same as\r\nbefore. The beginning of the third period is indicated by a diminution\r\nof the evening exacerbation, while the morning remissions become still\r\nmore marked. The diminution is progressive, but slow, the {282}\r\ntemperature each evening falling short by from half a degree to a\r\ndegree of the point it reached the preceding evening. The morning\r\nremissions, on the other hand, each day become greater, a fall of\r\nthree and a half degrees being not uncommon. The lysis, therefore,\r\noccupies usually a longer time than was required by the pyrexia in\r\nreaching its maximum. Toward the close of this period the morning\r\ntemperatures may be normal, as even subnormal, while an elevation of\r\ntemperature may continue to take place in the evening. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, an abrupt defervescence takes place. The duration of this\r\nperiod will be very much prolonged if complications are present or if\r\nthe intestinal ulcers are slow in healing. I have known it to last for\r\nmore than three weeks. During convalescence the temperature is\r\nfrequently subnormal even in the evening, but the slightest cause is\r\noften sufficient to produce a considerable though temporary elevation\r\nof temperature. I have known the temperature in one case to rise from\r\n99° F. to 105.6° in a few hours in consequence of an indiscretion in\r\ndiet, and in another from 100° to 104° from the suffering and\r\nexcitement caused by a severe attack of toothache. Indiscretions in\r\ndiet are a fruitful source of these recrudescences of fever. The fever\r\nof the third period has all the characters of an irritative fever, and\r\nis probably kept up by the irritation arising from the intestinal\r\nulcers. On the other hand, that of the first two periods is due to the\r\naction of the specific poison upon the nervous system and the other\r\ntissues of the body, and corresponds exactly with the primary fever of\r\nthe eruptive diseases.\r\n\r\n{283} [Illustration: FIG. 13. Chart showing recrudescence of fever\r\nfrom indiscretion of diet.]\r\n\r\nThe febrile movement, however, rarely follows a perfectly typical\r\ncourse, and I consequently find, in looking over the temperature\r\nsheets of a large number of cases, very few which bear, except during\r\nthe first period, anything more than a general resemblance to the\r\nchart which {284} Wunderlich has prepared as typical. A very slight\r\ncause will exercise, as has already been said, a disturbing influence\r\nupon the course of the fever, and serious complications or accidents\r\nwill of course produce a still more marked effect. An intestinal\r\nhemorrhage, for example, will cause a rapid and decided fall of\r\ntemperature. I have often known it to fall from 104° to the normal\r\ntemperature, or even below it. This depression, unless the bleeding\r\ncontinues and the case ends fatally in the course of a few hours, is\r\nonly temporary, the temperature rising within twenty-four hours to its\r\nformer height, and sometimes even beyond it. A free epistaxis or a\r\ncopious diarrhoea will in the same way cause a fall of the\r\ntemperature, but it is rarely so marked as in the preceding case. The\r\nsame effect is produced by the administration of large doses of quinia\r\nor by the application of cold water either in the form of the bath,\r\nthe douche, or any other form, to the surface of the body. On the\r\nother hand, the occurrence of a complication will cause a rise of\r\ntemperature, often considerably above the maximum of the first period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Chart showing fall from intestinal\r\nhemorrhage.]\r\n\r\nThe thermometer should be used at least twice daily. In this country\r\nit is generally introduced into the axilla, and less frequently into\r\nthe mouth, for the purpose of making an observation. In other\r\ncountries it is not infrequently inserted into the rectum, and even\r\ninto the vagina. The best hours for making the thermometric\r\nobservations are eight in the morning and eight in the evening, since\r\nit has been ascertained from {285} frequent observations that the\r\ndaily remissions are more marked between the hours of 6 and 8 A.M.,\r\nand that the temperature usually reaches its maximum some time between\r\nthose of 7 and 12 P.M.\r\n\r\nLoss of appetite is, except in mild cases, one of the earliest\r\nsymptoms of the disease, and usually persists as long as the fever\r\nlasts. It is sometimes accompanied by positive loathing for food, but\r\ngenerally there is no great difficulty in persuading the patient to\r\ntake the necessary amount of nourishment. During convalescence the\r\nappetite returns, and is occasionally immoderate, so that it is\r\nfrequently necessary to curb it lest harm should be done by over\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\nThirst, usually proportionate to the degree of fever, is also present\r\nin the beginning of the fever. Later, when the patient sinks into a\r\nsemi-unconscious condition and becomes insensible to the wants of the\r\nsystem, he will cease to call for water, although it is still urgently\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nNausea and vomiting sometimes occur at the beginning of the disease,\r\nbut they have not been such frequent symptoms in my experience as they\r\nwould appear to have been in that of Murchison, who says that they are\r\nof such common occurrence that the patient is often supposed at first\r\nto be suffering merely from a bilious attack. He does not regard them,\r\nwhen occurring at this stage, as serious symptoms. Indeed, he\r\nexpresses the belief that the subsequent course of the disease is\r\nsometimes favorably modified by them. They may also occur later in the\r\ndisease, and are then of grave import, as they are not infrequently\r\nthe consequence of peritonitis. Louis regarded vomiting as a grave\r\nsymptom, but it is probable it occurred in the cases from which he\r\nmakes his deductions late in the course of the disease. It may\r\nsometimes occur during convalescence, and may then interfere very\r\nmaterially with the proper nutrition of the patient. The matter\r\nvomited usually consists of a greenish bilious fluid, with the food\r\nlast taken. In some cases blood has been thrown up.\r\n\r\nThe tongue at the beginning of an attack of typhoid fever is usually\r\nmoist and coated with a thin white fur, and in mild cases may retain\r\nthese characters until the close. Even in some cases which terminate\r\nfatally in the course of the second week, the tongue, with the\r\nexception of being less moist than in health, may present no marked\r\ndeviation from this appearance. Generally, however, as the disease\r\nprogresses, and sometimes as early as the tenth day, it becomes dry\r\nand brownish, and is protruded with a tremulous motion. Still later it\r\ntends to cover itself with a thick brown coating. This coating is\r\ndisposed principally along the middle of the organ, leaving uncovered\r\nthe edges and tip, which are very apt to be unnaturally red in color.\r\nThe bare portion at the tip is often rudely triangular in shape--a\r\npoint which is regarded as of some importance in the diagnosis of the\r\ndisease by Da Costa. In bad cases, during the course of the third week\r\nthe tongue is frequently crossed by cracks and fissures, which are the\r\ncause of much discomfort to the patient, and when deep may bleed and\r\nleave behind them scars which are recognizable during the remainder of\r\nhis life. In other cases the tongue is dry, brown, and shrivelled, or\r\ncovered with a tenacious, viscid secretion which renders it difficult\r\nto protrude it.\r\n\r\nIn favorable cases, as convalescence approaches the tongue regains by\r\ndegrees its normal appearance. At first the only noticeable change may\r\n{286} be that the organ is a little less dry than before. In a few\r\ndays it will be observed to have become moist and to be gradually\r\nthrowing off its coating. The process is, however, a slow one, and\r\none, moreover, subject to frequent interruption. Very often, when it\r\nseems nearly completed it will be suddenly arrested, and the tongue\r\nbecome dry and brown. Sometimes, instead of cleaning itself gradually,\r\nthe tongue throws off its coating in large flakes, leaving the mucous\r\nmembrane red and shining, as if deprived of its papillary structure.\r\nWood was accustomed to teach that if the tongue when thus cleaned\r\nremained moist convalescence might be expected, but would always be\r\ntedious. This is an observation the correctness of which I have had\r\nabundant opportunity to confirm. If anything happens, however, to\r\ninterfere with the progress of convalescence, it not infrequently\r\nbecomes dry and coats itself over again. When the restoration to\r\nhealth is retarded by the continuance of diarrhoea or by the\r\noccurrence of any intercurrent affection, the tongue will often become\r\npale and flabby and be the seat of superficial ulcerations or of\r\naphthous exudations.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the posterior fauces is also often red and dry\r\nand covered with a glutinous secretion, which often materially\r\ninterferes with swallowing. The lips and teeth are in bad cases\r\nencrusted with sordes, and the former are dry and cracked, and bleed\r\nreadily when picked.\r\n\r\nMeteorism or tympanites is observed in the greater number of cases of\r\ntyphoid fever, having been noted by Murchison in 79 out of 100 cases,\r\nand by Hale in 130 out of 179 cases, and in only 43 of the remainder\r\nof his cases is it expressly stated to have been absent. My own\r\nexperience leads me to believe that it is present in even a larger\r\nproportion of cases; in fact, that it is rarely absent. It is, as a\r\nrule, later in making its appearance than the other abdominal\r\nsymptoms, showing itself usually about the end of the first or the\r\nbeginning of the second week. It is generally most marked in grave\r\ncases, especially those attended by severe diarrhoea, but I have seen\r\nit highly developed in cases in which the symptom was not present at\r\nall or but little developed. It may vary, moreover, frequently in\r\ndegree at different times in the same case, but when once present\r\ngenerally persists until convalescence is established or death occurs.\r\nWhen extreme, it may give rise to distressing dyspnoea by preventing\r\nthe descent of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe meteorism is usually preceded and accompanied by gurgling and\r\ntenderness on pressure in the right iliac fossa. The former of these\r\nsymptoms is most marked in cases in which diarrhoea exists, and is\r\ncaused by the presence of liquid and gas in the lower part of the\r\nileum. The tenderness is unquestionably due to the presence of ulcers\r\nin the same part of the bowel. There is also occasionally pain in the\r\nregion of the umbilicus, but this is a much less frequent symptom.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the spleen was noted by Hale as being present in some\r\nof the cases which he has described. It is a frequent symptom of the\r\ndisease, and may be generally demonstrated by percussion in the course\r\nof the second week. It has not, however, often happened to me to be\r\nable to feel the organ enlarged through the abdominal walls, as\r\nMurchison asserts he has been able to do. Indeed, tympanites is\r\nusually present in a sufficient degree to render this difficult. The\r\nenlargement {287} occurs more frequently in persons under thirty years\r\nof age than in those over it.\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea is one of the most frequent symptoms of the disease,\r\nespecially in severe cases, and there are very few mild cases in which\r\nit does not occur at some period of their course. Louis noted it in\r\nall but three of his fatal cases, Murchison in 93 out of 100, and M.\r\nBarth in 96 out of 101. It varies in different cases in severity, in\r\nduration, and in the time at which it appears. It may be one of the\r\nearliest symptoms, presenting itself frequently on the first day, and\r\noften being the only one which occasions uneasiness to the patient or\r\nhis physician. At other times its appearance may be postponed until\r\nthe end of the first week, or even until the patient is apparently\r\nentering on convalescence. It may be mild in the beginning and become\r\nmore severe as the disease progresses, or after having been at first\r\nacute may cease spontaneously in a few days to occasion any\r\nuneasiness. In degree it may vary from two stools to three or four, or\r\neven twenty, in the course of the twenty-four hours. It is absent in a\r\nfew cases, but in many even of these cases the bowels will be found to\r\nact inordinately after a very moderate dose of purgative medicine. I\r\nhave known, for instance, the administration of a single teaspoonful\r\nof castor oil to be followed by five or six stools in an adult.\r\nConstipation does, however, actually exist in a certain number of\r\ncases. Murchison has known the bowels in cases in which a relapse has\r\noccurred to be constipated in the primary attack and relaxed in the\r\nrelapse. There is no relation between the severity of the diarrhoea\r\nand the extent of the local lesion. Although oftenest met with in mild\r\ncases, constipation has existed in cases in which perforation of the\r\nbowel or intestinal hemorrhage has occurred during life, or very\r\nextensive lesions been found after death.\r\n\r\nThe stools are fetid and ammoniacal, and are alkaline in reaction,\r\ninstead of acid as in health. They are usually liquid and of the color\r\nof yellow ochre. Murchison says that they separate, on standing, into\r\ntwo layers--a supernatant fluid and a flaky sediment--but that,\r\noccasionally, instead of being watery they are pultaceous, frothy, and\r\nfermenting, and so light as to float in water. I have myself often\r\nseen the appearance which Bartlett compares to that of new cider. They\r\nmay contain blood, and when they do, occasionally present the\r\nappearance of coffee-grounds. They are not infrequently, in grave\r\ncases, passed involuntarily.\r\n\r\nIntestinal hemorrhage is fortunately not a frequent symptom of typhoid\r\nfever. It may occur as early as the fifth or sixth day, but is more\r\ncommon after the middle of the second week or in the third or fourth\r\nweek. In 60 cases observed by Murchison in which the hemorrhage\r\nexceeded six ounces it began during the second week (mostly toward its\r\nclose) in 8; during the third week in 28; during the fourth in 17;\r\nduring the fifth in 1; during the sixth in 3; during the seventh in 1;\r\nand during the eighth week in 1; while in one case the date of its\r\noccurrence is not noted. In the cases observed by Liebermeister and\r\nGriesinger, 113 in all, the bleeding took place in a much larger\r\nproportion of cases at an early period of the disease, occurring in as\r\nmany as 43 in the second week, and in only 27 during the third. In 7\r\ncases in which I had the opportunity of observing it in patients under\r\nmy own care it occurred on the seventeenth day in 1; on the\r\ntwenty-third day in 1; during the {288} third week in 2; during the\r\nfifth week in 2; and on the fifth day of a relapse in 1. There may be\r\na single hemorrhage, or the bleeding may be repeated one or more\r\ntimes. In 5 of my cases there was a second hemorrhage, and in 2 of\r\nthem a third; and in several of Murchison's cases it recurred at\r\nvarying intervals after its first appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen the bleeding occurs early in the disease it is usually\r\ninsignificant in amount, and is due either to extreme congestion of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the intestine, giving rise to rupture of the\r\ncapillaries, or to disintegration of the blood, allowing its ready\r\npassage through the walls of the vessels. In the latter case it\r\nusually coexists with petechiæ or a hemorrhage from some other part of\r\nthe body, as, for instance, epistaxis or hematuria. After the middle\r\nof the second week the hemorrhage is generally the result of the\r\nlaying open of a small artery, either by the detachment of a slough\r\nfrom one of the glands of Peyer or by the involvement of its walls in\r\nthe ulcerative process. It is then often profuse, and may even reach\r\nseveral pints in quantity. Murchison has, however, seen profuse\r\nhemorrhage at such an early stage of the disease that it was\r\nimpossible that ulceration could have taken place. The blood is not\r\nalways voided immediately after a hemorrhage has taken place; it may\r\nbe retained for some days. Indeed, if the amount be large the patient\r\nmay die within a few hours of its occurrence without any appearance of\r\nblood externally. This is, however, rare; it is more usual for the\r\nhemorrhage to be repeated before death takes place, but the occurrence\r\nof the bleeding may be suspected in such cases by the abrupt fall of\r\ntemperature, sometimes below the normal standard, and by the extreme\r\nprostration and pallor which come on suddenly without other assignable\r\ncause. The depression of the temperature does not continue long. It\r\ngenerally reaches its former elevation, or even exceeds it, in the\r\ncourse of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThere would appear to be a slight difference in the frequency with\r\nwhich intestinal hemorrhage occurs in different times and at different\r\nplaces. Murchison noted it in 58 cases of 1564, or 3.77 per cent.;\r\nLouis in 8 cases of 134, or 5.9 per cent.; Liebermeister in 127 cases\r\nof 1743, or 7.3 per cent.; Griesinger in 32 cases of 600, or 5.3 per\r\ncent.; and I have noted it 7 times in 81 cases, or in about 8.5 per\r\ncent. Liebermeister makes it twice as frequent in women as in men. It\r\nseems to be much less common in children than in adults, for in 252\r\npatients under fifteen years of age observed by Taupin, Rilliet, and\r\nBarthez it occurred in 1 only. There is considerable diversity of\r\nopinion among observers in regard to the importance of this symptom.\r\nMurchison lost 32 of his 60 cases. In 11 of the 32 fatal cases the\r\nimmediate cause of death was peritonitis; in 14 of the remaining 21\r\ncases the patients died within three days of the bleeding, and in 8 of\r\nthe 14 within a few hours. Of Liebermeister's 127 cases 49, and of\r\nGriesinger's 32 cases 10, terminated fatally; 3 of my own cases ended\r\nin death, but none of them until several days had elapsed after the\r\nbleeding. In the face of facts such as these there have not been\r\nwanting authors to assert that the effect of the hemorrhage was\r\nsometimes beneficial. Chief among these are the celebrated Irish\r\nphysician Graves and his devoted admirer Trousseau. There may\r\noccasionally be a slight subsidence of the nervous symptoms upon the\r\noccurrence of a hemorrhage, consequent upon the reduction of\r\ntemperature {289} which usually accompanies it, but this relief is\r\nonly temporary, and procured at too great expense to be really of\r\nservice to the patient.\r\n\r\nThe bleeding is most frequently observed in bad cases. All the cases\r\nwhich were under my care in which it occurred were of great severity\r\nfrom the very start. In 18 of Murchison's 60 cases the antecedent\r\nsymptoms were mild. In 3 of my cases there was severe diarrhoea. In 2\r\nof the other cases, 1 of which was fatal, the bowels were constipated,\r\nand in another one, also fatal, they were slightly loose. In 8 of\r\nMurchison's cases, 6 of which were fatal, the bowels had been\r\nconstipated up to the time of its occurrence. The blood, if voided\r\nimmediately after its escape into the intestines, is generally fluid\r\nand bright red in color. When retained for a day or two it is passed\r\nin dark clots, and if retained longer than this it is usually mixed\r\nwith fecal matter when discharged from the bowels, and gives the\r\nstools a tarry appearance and consistence, which is not always\r\nrecognized by inexperienced attendants as due to blood.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that intestinal hemorrhage has become more\r\nfrequent since the introduction of the cold-water treatment, but\r\nLiebermeister shows this to be an error, for he has found that of 861\r\ncases treated before the introduction of this treatment, 72, or 8.4\r\nper cent., had intestinal hemorrhage, but that of 882 cases treated\r\nsince its introduction hemorrhage occurred in 55, or in 6.2 per cent.\r\nOther methods of treatment have also been charged with inducing a\r\ntendency to hemorrhage, but probably not upon more substantial grounds\r\nthan the above.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of perforation may be suspected when the patient is\r\nsuddenly seized with acute pain in the abdomen, accompanied by\r\nsymptoms of collapse and occasionally by rigors. The fall of\r\ntemperature is often considerable. Liebermeister refers to one case in\r\nwhich it was as much as 5-1/2°, or from 104° to 98-1/2°. Very soon the\r\nabdomen becomes tender on pressure, and, if it were not so before,\r\nhard and tympanitic; the pulse grows frequent, small, and sometimes\r\nalmost imperceptible; the breathing is thoracic; the physiognomy\r\nexpresses great suffering; the features are contracted, and the face\r\nis bathed in profuse perspiration. Nausea and vomiting come on soon\r\nafter inflammation has commenced, and rapidly exhaust the patient. The\r\ndecubitus is dorsal, and the legs are generally drawn up so as to\r\nrelax the abdominal muscles. Prostration rapidly increases until death\r\nputs an end to the patient's sufferings. Occasionally, the symptoms\r\nare more obscure. Pain and rigors may both be wanting, and nothing but\r\nthe extreme prostration, the frequent and feeble pulse, and the\r\ndistended condition of the abdomen will indicate the gravity of the\r\ndanger. This is not infrequently the case in delirious patients. Death\r\nmay take place during the collapse, but this is rare. It more\r\nfrequently takes place on the second or third day; on the other hand,\r\nit may be postponed until much later. Liebermeister and Murchison\r\nrefer to cases in which there was an interval of two or three weeks\r\nbetween the first symptom of perforation and the fatal result.\r\n\r\nPerforation of the intestine was formerly regarded as an inevitably\r\nfatal accident, but this view is no longer entertained. I have had\r\nunder my observation cases in which all the symptoms of this accident\r\nwere present, and in which recovery took place. In some of these cases\r\nthere {290} may have been an error of diagnosis, but all of them will\r\nnot admit of this explanation. Moreover, cases of a similar character\r\nhave been reported by physicians whose skill in diagnosis is\r\nuniversally recognized. Thus, Murchison reports six such cases,\r\nTweedie two, and Wood one. Liebermeister and Bristowe[53] also both\r\nsay that recovery is possible. This view is sustained by the results\r\nof certain autopsies. In one of these, reported by Buhl,[54] a\r\nperforation was found completely closed by adhesions to the mesentery,\r\nand in others reported by Murchison partial adhesion had taken place\r\nbetween the edges of the perforation and the abdominal walls or to an\r\nadjoining coil of intestine. Occasionally, the inflammation excited by\r\nthe perforation may be circumscribed and terminate in an abscess,\r\nwhich may permit recovery by discharging itself into the bowel or\r\nexternally. At other times, however, it ruptures into the peritoneal\r\ncavity, when death speedily ensues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_,\r\nvol. xi. p. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Cited by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nPerforation is, fortunately, not a frequent accident in typhoid fever.\r\nIt was the cause of death in 20 only of 250 fatal cases collected by\r\nHoffmann. It occurred, according to Liebermeister, in only 26 cases, 3\r\nof which ended in recovery, in more than 2000 cases observed at the\r\nhospital at Basle. Murchison observed it 48 times in 1580 cases,\r\nGriesinger 14 times in 118 cases, and Flint twice in 73 cases.\r\nMurchison found that in a total of 1721 autopsies, the details of\r\nwhich were collected from various sources, it was the cause of death\r\nin 196, or 11.38 per cent. It would appear to be rather more common on\r\nthe continent of Europe than in England or in this country.\r\nPerforation is much more frequently met with in men than in women. The\r\npatients were men in 15 of 21 of Liebermeister's cases, in 51 of 73 of\r\nMurchison's, and in 72 of 106 cases collected by Näcke. It is rarer in\r\nchildren than in adults. Rilliet, Barthez, and Taupin met with it only\r\nthree times in 232 children under treatment. Murchison has, however,\r\nhad a fatal case in a child of five years of age. It is also not\r\ncommon after forty years of age, but does occasionally occur, although\r\nthe contrary has been asserted.\r\n\r\nPerforation is most likely to happen during or after the third week of\r\nthe disease, but it has been met with as early as the eighth day, as\r\nin a case reported by Peacock. On the other hand, in three cases cited\r\nby Morin[55] it did not occur until the seventy-second, seventy-sixth,\r\nand one hundred and tenth day, respectively. Instances are on record\r\nin which it has taken place after the patient was supposed to be\r\nthoroughly convalescent and had returned to his occupation. When it\r\noccurs early it is due to the separation of a slough. After the middle\r\nor end of the third week it is probably always the result of the\r\nextension of the ulcerative process to the peritoneal coat. In a large\r\nproportion of cases the perforation has been preceded by symptoms of\r\ngreat gravity, such as severe diarrhoea, great tympany and tenderness\r\nof the abdomen, and intestinal hemorrhage, but in a certain number of\r\ninstances the cases in which it has occurred have been of a mild\r\ncharacter, the patient in many of them not considering himself sick\r\nenough to take to his bed or even to abstain from his daily labor.\r\nAfter death the perforating ulcer has been found to be the only one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nThe most frequent causes of perforation are the irritation arising\r\nfrom {291} indigestible and unsuitable food, distension of the bowels\r\nby feces or gas, vomiting, and movements on the part of the patient.\r\nLiebermeister calls attention to the frequency with which ascarides\r\nare found in the intestines of those who die of perforation, and is\r\ninclined to think they may have something to do with causing it.\r\nMorin[56] reports a case in which the perforation appeared to be\r\ncaused by the administration of an enema.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nFor our knowledge of the changes in the composition of the urine we\r\nare largely indebted to Parkes and certain German observers. As the\r\ndisease generally begins insidiously, the condition of the urine\r\nbefore the attack and during the first two or three days has not been\r\nascertained with certainty. During the latter part of the first week\r\nthe amount of water is greatly diminished, occasionally falling to\r\none-fourth or one-sixth of the usual quantity. In the second and third\r\nweeks it increases, and at the end of the fourth week may again be\r\nnormal. The amount may, however, vary from day to day, but its\r\nvariations do not stand in close relation to those of the febrile\r\nheat; that is, the thermometer may mark one day 104°, and the next day\r\n100°, while the amount of urine remains the same. Still, when the\r\ntemperature begins to fall permanently it increases at once, or,\r\naccording to Thierfelder, two or three days after. The specific\r\ngravity is usually high in almost all cases in which the urine is\r\nscanty, and may be as high 1038. With the establishment of\r\nconvalescence the specific gravity often diminishes before the water\r\nbegins to increase. In other words, the lessening of the solids of the\r\nurine frequently takes place prior to the increase of the water.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the urine is very acid in the beginning, but the\r\nacidity is not due to an increased secretion of acid, but simply to\r\nconcentration. Later it may become alkaline, and even ammoniacal. The\r\ncolor of the urine is darker than in health during the early part of\r\nthe febrile period. This is due partly to concentration, and partly to\r\nincreased disintegration of the blood-corpuscles, which is a\r\nconsequence of the fever.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of urea is augmented during the fever, and especially\r\nduring the first week, when the water and chlorides of sodium are most\r\ndiminished. As a general rule, the higher the temperature the greater\r\nthe amount of urea. It may, however, be very much diminished during\r\nthe presence of inflammatory complications. On the other hand, it is\r\nnot affected by diarrhoea. Uric acid is uniformly increased, the\r\namount of increase being relatively greater than that of the urea; it\r\nis often doubled, and sometimes the increase is even more than this.\r\nThis increase takes place, according to Zimmer, up to the fourteenth\r\nday. It diminishes after this, and during convalescence may fall below\r\nthe normal amount. Copious deposits of urates may occur at any time in\r\nthe course of the disease. The chloride of sodium is usually\r\ndiminished in amount. This diminution is partly due to a less amount\r\nof this salt being taken with the food, and partly to the fact that\r\nlarge quantities of it pass away with the stools. As the diminution\r\ncannot always be fully accounted for in this way, it would appear that\r\nit is also stored up in the body during the fever. In cases in which\r\nsweating and purging are absent the sulphuric acid is increased in\r\namount. The phosphoric acid is at first slightly diminished, but later\r\nundergoes an increase. The hippuric acid is also diminished.\r\n\r\n{292} Parkes found albumen in the urine in 7 out of 21 cases. In 5 of\r\nthese it was temporary, and entirely disappeared before the patients\r\nleft the hospital. Becquerel found it in 8 out of 38 cases, Andral in\r\nonly 4 out of 34 cases. Griesinger found it commonly, though it was\r\nusually temporary. He met with only four or five cases in which it was\r\nnever present. Kerchensteiner found albumen in a fourth part of the\r\nsevere cases. Brattler noticed it in 9 out of 23 cases. I have very\r\nfrequently found it myself, but it has always been in my cases a\r\ntemporary phenomenon. Desquamative nephritis may occur occasionally in\r\nthe course of typhoid fever, and give rise to the appearance of a\r\nlarge amount of albumen in the urine, and also occasionally of blood.\r\nRenal epithelia and casts are sometimes seen in cases in which there\r\nis albuminuria, but usually soon disappear. Zimmermann asserts that in\r\nall but very slight cases casts may be found even when no albumen can\r\nbe detected. The statement is probably too general, but there is no\r\ndoubt of the occasional presence of casts under these circumstances.\r\nBladder epithelia and pus-cells are seen in a few cases in small\r\nquantities, but decided cystitis is rare, unless it has ensued upon\r\nretention of urine. Sugar has not been found except in the urine of\r\ndiabetic patients, who may have happened to contract typhoid fever. In\r\nthese patients the sugar diminishes, and is sometimes wholly absent\r\nduring the continuance of the fever. Leucin and tyrosin have been\r\nfound by Frerichs, but at present no observations have been made as to\r\nthe frequency or import of their occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, when the prostration is extreme, the urine is passed\r\ninvoluntarily, but in some of these cases the incontinence of the\r\nurine is only apparent, and is really the result of over-distension of\r\nthe bladder. This is a condition which is very apt to be overlooked,\r\nand I have known paralysis of the bladder to result in consequence of\r\nthis neglect, and to continue sometimes after convalescence has been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--Although cerebral symptoms are among the\r\ncommonest manifestations of the disturbing effects produced in the\r\neconomy by the typhoid fever poison, they are almost always\r\nindependent of inflammation of the brain and its membranes. In a few\r\ncases, however, the lesions of meningitis have been found after death.\r\nIn some of these it has come on without assignable cause, in others it\r\nhas been the consequence of pyæmia, of tubercles, or of the extension\r\nof inflammation from the petrous portion of the temporal bone.\r\nOccasionally, during convalescence, some impairment of the intellect\r\nis observed. This may consist in simply some loss of memory or\r\nchildishness of manner. At other times delusions of a mild form are\r\npresent, or else the patient is liable to attacks of acute mania,\r\nsometimes violent, coming on suddenly and without fever. In a few\r\ninstances the moral sense seems to have been perverted, as in the case\r\nreported by Dr. Nathan Smith, already referred to, in which a young\r\nman of previously good character developed a propensity to steal after\r\nhis attack. Recovery with the re-establishment of the physical health\r\nalmost occurs in these cases. Murchison says he knows of no case in\r\nwhich this condition has been permanent. On the other hand, Dr. C. M.\r\nCampbell,[57] who had the opportunity of observing an attack of\r\ntyphoid fever among some insane patients {293} at the Durham County\r\nAsylum, reports that the mental state was in no case injuriously\r\naffected by the disease, but, on the contrary, underwent a marked\r\nimprovement in several of the cases. Indeed, in two of the cases, in\r\nwhich the prognosis had become very unfavorable, mental recovery began\r\nduring the attack of fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _The Journal of Mental Science_, July, 1882.]\r\n\r\nParalysis, muscular tremors, and chorea are also occasionally observed\r\nafter attacks of typhoid fever. According to Murchison, paralysis does\r\nnot supervene until several weeks after the commencement of\r\nconvalescence. It may last for several weeks or months, but recovery\r\nin the majority of instances eventually takes place. According to\r\nNothnägel,[58] the most common form is paraplegia, but it may also\r\ntake the form of hemiplegia, strabismus, paralysis of the portio dura,\r\nmotor paralysis of individual spinal nerves, such as the ulnar or\r\nperoneal, or local anæsthesia. On the other hand, neuralgias and\r\ndisturbances of sensation are not common sequelæ of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Cited by Murchison. See also article by Paget, _St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital Report_, vol. xii.]\r\n\r\nDegeneration of the muscular tissue of the heart is probably present\r\nin some degree in every case of typhoid fever, being, of course, most\r\nmarked in the severest cases. There would seem, however, to be no\r\nspecial tendency to disease of its valves or membranes. Arterial\r\nthrombosis or embolism, giving rise to gangrene of the part supplied\r\nby the obstructed artery, is of occasional occurrence. Patry,[59]\r\nHayem,[60] Trousseau,[61] and others report or refer to several cases\r\nin which gangrene of the leg, hand, or cheek was observed, and among\r\nothers a case in which sphacelus depending upon obstruction of the\r\ncarotid artery, the result, as Patry thought, of arteritis, commenced\r\nin the left ear, and extended from there to the forehead and\r\ncheek.[62] A. Martin[63] reports the case of a woman who expelled from\r\nthe vagina a fetid-smelling structure of cylindrical form, which\r\nproved to be the cervix of the uterus, with the upper part of the\r\nvagina, and in whom menstruation was not re-established until after\r\nthe performance of an operation. Spillmann[64] has also called\r\nattention to the occurrence of gangrene of the vagina and vulva in\r\ncases of typhoid fever. {294} This complication is generally met with\r\ntoward the end of the febrile period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Archives générales de Médicine_, 1863, vol. i. pp.\r\n129-549.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Clinique médicale_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Since the above was written Barié has called attention\r\nin the _Revue de Médicine_, Jan. and Feb., 1884, to the frequency with\r\nwhich acute inflammation of the arteries occurs as a sequel of typhoid\r\nfever. The author, whose investigations were limited to the larger\r\narteries, found that the vessels generally implicated are in the order\r\nof their frequency, the posterior tibial, the femoral, and the dorsal\r\nartery of the foot. The affection is usually unilateral, appears\r\nduring convalescence or when the patient leaves his bed, and occurs\r\njust as often after light as after severe cases. He distinguishes two\r\nvarieties: 1, acute obliterating arteritis, and, 2, acute parietal\r\narteritis. The first variety is characterized by embryonal\r\ninfiltration of all the tissues, by disappearance of the smoothness of\r\nthe intima, which becomes uneven and granular, and by the formation of\r\na secondary thrombus, and almost invariably terminates in dry\r\ngangrene. The second is merely an inflammation without such a clot,\r\nand always terminates in recovery without gangrene.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of obliterating arteritis are--pain, more or less sudden\r\nin its onset, directly over the course of affected vessels, and\r\nincreased by pressure, by the erect position, and by walking;\r\ndiminution, and then absence, of pulsation; swelling of the limb,\r\nwithout oedema or redness; and, later, the appearance of bluish\r\nmottling of the surface, and, more rarely, of patches of purpura;\r\nlowering of the temperature, with or without troubles of sensibility,\r\nsuch as formication, anæsthesia, etc., and the appearance of a hard\r\nand painful cord, due to the formation of the thrombus. In the\r\nparietal form the diminution of the pulsations is sometimes preceded\r\nby a considerable exaggeration of their amplitude, and, while the\r\ntemperature on the affected side is usually lowered, it may sometimes\r\nbe increased.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Centralblatt f. Gynakol_, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Archives générale_, Mars, 1881.]\r\n\r\nVenous thrombosis, the result of weakness of the heart's action, is\r\nmore frequently observed. It occurs generally during the convalescence\r\nof cases which have run a severe course, and usually affects the veins\r\nof the lower extremities. I have seen both the femoral veins\r\nobstructed from this cause at the same time. All the cases which have\r\ncome under my own observation have ended in recovery, and only 2 of 31\r\ncollected by Liebermeister terminated fatally. Death occurred in 3 of\r\nthe 17 cases collected by Murchison, but in none of them was this\r\nresult attributable to this complication alone. There is, however,\r\nalways danger of a portion of the thrombus becoming detached and\r\nproducing embolism of the pulmonary artery.\r\n\r\nPyæmia is said by Murchison and other authors to be an occasional\r\ncomplication, but it is certainly rare in this country. In the milder\r\ncases abscesses form during convalescence beneath the skin in\r\ndifferent parts of the body. In the more severe cases pus is deposited\r\nin the joints or in the internal organs. Albert Robin[65] has reported\r\ntwo cases in which there was suppurative joint affection. In one of\r\nthese the joints of the fingers and toes, with the sheaths of the\r\ncorresponding extensor tendons and both knee-joints and one\r\nshoulder-joint, were affected. In the other the left knee was filled\r\nwith pus. In both cases the fever soon assumed an adynamic character.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Gazette de Paris_, 1881.]\r\n\r\nLaryngitis may sometimes occur in the course of typhoid fever, and\r\nwhen it assumes the diphtheritic form and runs on to the formation of\r\nulcers is a very serious complication of typhoid fever, as it is not\r\ninfrequently accompanied by oedema of the glottis and gives rise to\r\nthe necessity for tracheotomy. It is fortunately, at least in its\r\nworst forms, rare in this country. In Germany, judging from the number\r\nof cases collected by Hoffmann and Griesinger, it is of more common\r\noccurrence. The ulcers are oftener met with in some epidemics than in\r\nothers. During the winter of 1860-61, which I passed in Vienna, the\r\nfrequency with which they occurred was the subject of remark among\r\nthose who were in attendance upon the various clinics.\r\n\r\nI have already called attention to the frequency with which bronchitis\r\nin some form or other attends upon typhoid fever. When it invades the\r\nsmaller bronchial tubes it occasionally gives rise to lobular\r\npneumonia or to collapse of some of the lobules of the lung. Lobar\r\npneumonia may also occur in the course of typhoid fever. It was\r\nobserved 52 times in 1420 cases of typhoid fever under treatment at\r\nthe Basle hospital from 1865-68. When it comes on late in the disease,\r\nespecially if the patient is comatose, or even semi-conscious, it may\r\nbe entirely overlooked, unless the lungs are carefully examined, as it\r\noften does not reveal itself to us by any of the ordinary symptoms. It\r\nmay, however, occur early, and I have known it so prominent in the\r\nbeginning of an attack that the existence of typhoid fever was not\r\nsuspected. It sometimes terminates in abscess or gangrene, but is more\r\nusually followed by chronic pneumonia, which may eventually either end\r\nin recovery or lay the foundation for phthisis. Pleurisy with effusion\r\nis also not an uncommon complication. It was observed, according to\r\nLiebermeister, at the hospital at Basle 64 {295} times in 1743 cases\r\nof fever. It is also a serious complication, as 21 of the 64 cases\r\nterminated fatally. Murchison refers to three cases in which it was\r\nfollowed by empyema. Other morbid conditions of the respiratory organs\r\nwhich may occur as complications of typhoid fever are oedema,\r\ninfarction, hypostatic congestion of the lungs, emphysema, and\r\npneumothorax. Acute miliary tuberculosis is also an occasional\r\ncomplication, but is oftener met with as a sequel. According to\r\nLiebermeister, the tendency to pulmonary complications has diminished\r\nsince the introduction of the cold-water treatment.\r\n\r\nCatarrhal or diphtheritic inflammation of the fauces and pharynx\r\noccurs in a large number of cases, and frequently gives rise to a\r\ngreat deal of difficulty in swallowing. Indeed, it has been so\r\nfrequently observed in some epidemics that a few writers have regarded\r\nit as a symptom rather than a complication of the disease. Either of\r\nthe varieties of inflammation may extend through the Eustachian tube\r\nto the middle ear and be the cause of deafness, which usually passes\r\noff as the inflammation subsides. Occasionally, however, the affection\r\nof the middle ear gives rise to perforation of the tympanum or to\r\ncaries of the petrous portion of the temporal bone.\r\n\r\nMurchison says he has known the symptoms of and lesions of dysentery\r\nto coexist with those of typhoid fever in several cases, and\r\nLiebermeister asserts that diphtheria of the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane is an occasional sequel to severe cases, especially when\r\nother mucous membranes are the seat of diphtheritic inflammation. In a\r\nfew instances which have come under his observation it had given rise\r\nto perforation of the bowel or to gangrene of the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nJaundice occasionally occurs in the course of the disease. I have\r\nnever happened to see this complication, and am inclined to think it\r\nis rare in this country. Liebermeister, however, met with it 6 times\r\nin 1420 cases, and Griesinger 10 times in 600 cases. Hoffmann found it\r\nin 10 of 250 fatal cases, and Murchison was able to collect 9 cases,\r\nall of which but one terminated in death. Several of Griesinger's\r\ncases, however, ended in recovery. In a few cases the jaundice may be\r\nattributed to catarrh of the biliary ducts, but this solution of the\r\nquestion will not explain those cases in which the feces remain\r\ncolored throughout. In fatal cases marked degeneration of the liver\r\nhas been found, which Liebermeister regards as of similar character to\r\nthat which occurs in acute yellow atrophy. In two of Murchison's cases\r\nthe liver was small and its secreting cells loaded with oil. In most\r\ncases it does not appear until late in the disease, but it has been\r\nobserved as early as the fifth day.\r\n\r\nAbscess of the liver and diphtheritic inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the gall-bladder are among the rarer sequelæ of typhoid\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis is the most serious of all the complications of typhoid\r\nfever. Its most common cause is perforation of the bowel, but it may\r\nalso be due to the extension of inflammation to the peritoneal\r\nmembrane without ulceration. Liebermeister believes that it is\r\nsometimes the result of the typhoid infiltration so frequent in\r\nvarious tissues of the body taking place in the serous membrane. In\r\nother cases it arises from the rupture of softened mesenteric glands,\r\nof softened {296} infarctions in the spleen, or of the abscesses which\r\nare sometimes the consequence of the circumscribed inflammation by\r\nwhich perforation is occasionally prevented from proving immediately\r\nfatal. Less frequent causes of it are rupture of the gall-bladder,\r\nwith the escape of gall-stones into the cavity of the abdomen,\r\nabscesses of the ovary, and abscesses in the walls of the urinary\r\nbladder. It is said by Murchison to have been in one case the result\r\nof a pseudo-abscess in the sheath of the rectus muscle bursting\r\ninward.\r\n\r\nSwelling of the parotid gland occasionally occurs in typhoid fever,\r\nbut is much less common than in typhus. It is most frequently met with\r\nin bad cases about the end of the third week or later, and generally\r\ninvolves one side only. The swelling is hard and firm in the\r\nbeginning, and may terminate in resolution or suppuration. I have seen\r\nit three times only, twice in my own practice, and once in that of a\r\nmedical friend. One of my cases was fatal, the other ended in\r\nrecovery, as did, I believe, the third case. Murchison saw it in only\r\n6 cases, 5 of which were fatal. According to Hoffmann,[66] 16 cases of\r\nsuppurative parotitis were found at Basle among about 1600 typhoid\r\nfever patients, 7 of the 16 ending fatally. Parotitis without\r\nsuppuration occurred three times. In 15 cases the attack was confined\r\nto one side, 9 times to the right and 6 to the left; in 4 it was\r\ndouble. Trousseau[67] looks upon these swellings as a very grave\r\naccident, and says that he has scarcely ever seen a case recover in\r\nwhich it has occurred, either in the course of typhoid fever or any\r\nother disease. Chomel, on the other hand, is said to have regarded\r\nthem as critical and auspicious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Quoted by Liebermeister.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Clinique médicale de l'Hôtel Dieu_, t. i. 1861.]\r\n\r\nMenstruation occasionally occurs during typhoid fever, and may be\r\nprofuse. Bartels,[68] who has investigated the histories of 172\r\npatients in reference to this point, says that the catamenia always\r\nappear if the menstrual period falls within the first five days of the\r\nfever, and that they do so in two-thirds of the cases if they are\r\nexpected between the sixth and fourteenth days. On the other hand,\r\nmenstruation does not occur if the time for it falls in the third\r\nweek. He says also that the catamenia generally appears about the time\r\nthey are expected, or later, and very seldom earlier. Liebermeister,\r\non the contrary, says that they often occur prematurely. Other uterine\r\nhemorrhages seldom occur, and never in those who have ceased to\r\nmenstruate or in whom the function has not been established.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Petersb. Med. Wochenschr._, 1881.]\r\n\r\nSuppuration of Bartholini's glands is said by Speilman to have taken\r\nplace in one case.[69] In the fourth week the patient complained of\r\nviolent pains in the right nympha, which, upon examination, was found\r\nto be swollen. A tumor as large as a nut, which was red and painful on\r\npressure, could also be felt in the vagina.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Arch. générales_, Mars, 1882.]\r\n\r\nPregnancy was formerly thought to confer an entire immunity from\r\ntyphoid fever, but recent and accurate investigations have shown that\r\nif this immunity really exists, it is only relative, not absolute.\r\nGusserow[70] says that the disease is more frequently met with in the\r\nfirst half than in the latter half of pregnancy. Abortion under these\r\ncircumstances commonly occurs. Gusserow says that it takes place in\r\nfrom 60 {297} to 80 per cent. of the cases. He believes it to be due\r\nto the high temperature, which causes the death of the foetus, which\r\nis then expelled from the uterus. In a few cases, however, the child\r\nis born living. Of Murchison's 14 cases, 10 recovered, and two of the\r\nten patients carried the child, at the fourth and eighth months\r\nrespectively, throughout the attack. All the others miscarried or\r\naborted, only one of them being delivered of a living child. Out of 18\r\npregnant women[71] treated in the hospital of Basle for typhoid fever,\r\nbetween the years 1865 and 1868, 15 miscarried or aborted. In the\r\nthree years following the introduction of the anti-pyretic treatment\r\nonly five cases of abortion occurred, and but one of these proved\r\nfatal. This accident generally happens during the second or third week\r\nof the fever. It is always a serious complication, and if it occurs in\r\nthe first three months of pregnancy it generally gives rise to profuse\r\nhemorrhage, which is usually followed by a fall of temperature as\r\nmarked as that observed in hemorrhage from the intestines. Just as in\r\nthe latter case, the fall is only temporary, being soon succeeded by a\r\nrapid rise of the temperature to its former height, or even beyond it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Schmidt's Jahrbuch_, Bd. 193, No. 1, 1880, from _Berl.\r\nklin. Wochenschr._, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Liebermeister, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nThe danger of bed-sores occurring in typhoid fever is in consequence\r\nof the impaired nutrition of the tissues, the length of time the\r\ndisease lasts, and the great emaciation which usually attends\r\nit--greater than in any other acute disease. They constitute a very\r\nserious and troublesome complication, and may occur on any part of the\r\nbody subjected to pressure, but are most frequent over the sacrum and\r\ntrochanters. Oedema of the lower extremities from feebleness of the\r\ncirculation is occasionally observed in the convalescence from\r\nprotracted attacks. Lendel has published a series of 7 cases observed\r\nat Rouen, in which the entire body became very oedematous in the\r\nsecond or third week of the attack or during convalescence. In none of\r\nthe cases was the urine albuminous. All the patients recovered except\r\none, who died of peritonitis. Similar cases have been reported by\r\nother observers. Barthez and Rilliet have seen several cases in\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nPeriostitis is an occasional sequel. I have seen it in one case only.\r\nSir James Paget,[72] who appears to have met with it in several cases,\r\nsays that it never occurs in the continuity of the fever, but always\r\nwhen the patient is apparently convalescent, when his temperature is\r\nnormal and constant, and he is beginning to move about and to grow\r\nstronger and stouter. Its most usual seat is the tibia, but it is also\r\nmet with in the femur, ulna, and parietal bone. Except in one case,\r\nSir James has never seen it in more than one bone in the same person.\r\nIt is always circumscribed within a space of from one to three inches\r\nin extent, and usually subsides without necrosis or other abiding\r\nchange of structure; but in some cases the patient has remained for\r\nsome time subject to repeated attacks of pain and swelling of\r\nperiosteum. In the few cases, he says, in which the periostitis is\r\nfollowed by necrosis the extent of dead bone has always been less than\r\nthat of the inflammation over it. Murchison, however, refers to two\r\ncases of necrosis of the tibia, to one of the temporal bone, and to\r\ntwo in which extensive necrosis of the lower jaw occurred. Gay[73]\r\nalso reports a case of extensive necrosis of the thigh-bone in a child\r\nthree years old, following an attack of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: _St. Bartholomew's Hospital Report_, vol. xxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Path. Trans. Lond._, vol. xx., p. 290.]\r\n\r\n{298} Very frequently after an attack of typhoid fever the patient\r\nevinces a tendency to grow stout, which is either continuous or else\r\nis gradually lost after he fully recovers his health. This increase in\r\nflesh is not always accompanied by a corresponding gain in physical\r\nstrength, and he may remain for a long time after convalescence is\r\napparently complete incapacitated for much bodily or mental exertion.\r\nSometimes, on the other hand, the patient, instead of gaining flesh\r\nand strength, may continue weak and emaciated, even when he is taking\r\na full amount of nourishment, which he is, however, unable to\r\nassimilate. Cases of this kind may terminate in phthisis, but they\r\noccasionally prove fatal, without any discoverable lesion after death\r\nexcept an abnormally smooth appearance of the mucous membrane of the\r\nileum and a shrivelled condition of the mesenteric glands.[74]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Murchison.]\r\n\r\nPatients suffering from typhoid fever may occasionally contract other\r\nspecific diseases. Murchison has notes of eight cases in which the\r\neruption of this disease coexisted with that of scarlatina, and says\r\nthat it was not uncommon in the London Fever Hospital for a patient\r\nsuffering from the former disease to contract the latter. Similar\r\ncases are recorded by other observers. Typhoid fever may also be\r\ncomplicated with rubeola, pertussis, diphtheria, variola, and\r\nvaccinia. I have repeatedly seen children convalescent from typhoid\r\nfever in the hospitals of Paris contract one or other of the eruptive\r\nfevers.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.--A great variety of forms of typhoid fever has been\r\ndescribed by various authors, but as many of them present few points\r\nof difference from the usual form of the disease, it will not be\r\nnecessary to discuss them at any length. They derive their names from\r\nsome peculiarity of the mode of seizure, from the prominence of some\r\none symptom or set of symptoms, or from the presence of complications.\r\nThey are--(1) The adynamic form, in which prostration is marked in the\r\nbeginning and throughout the attack. (2) The ataxic or nervous form,\r\nwhich is characterized by the predominance of delirium, subsultus\r\ntendinum, and other nervous symptoms. (3) The hemorrhagic form, in\r\nwhich there is a special tendency to hemorrhage from the different\r\nmucous membranes. (4) The abdominal form, in which the abdominal\r\nsymptoms, such as diarrhoea and tympanites, are well developed. (5)\r\nThe thoracic form, so called from the presence of some thoracic\r\ncomplication. (6) The gastric or bilious form, in which the disease is\r\ncomplicated at its commencement by gastro-intestinal catarrh. La forme\r\nmuqueuse of French authors is probably identical with the above. (7)\r\nThe acute form, in which the disease begins abruptly and with great\r\nviolence, and runs a very rapid course, terminating usually in death\r\nbefore the end of the first week or early in the second, before\r\nulceration can have taken place. Delirium is an early and prominent\r\nsymptom in this form, so that it has sometimes been mistaken for\r\nmeningitis.\r\n\r\nCertain forms of the disease deserve a little fuller consideration.\r\nOne of the most important of these is the abortive form, in which, as\r\nits names implies, the fever is cut short in its course, and in which\r\nthere is every reason to believe that infiltration of Peyer's glands\r\ntakes place as usual, but that the subsequent course of the disease is\r\ndifferent, the glands undergoing resolution instead of advancing to\r\nulceration. The majority {299} of observers agree that in the\r\nbeginning there is nothing to distinguish such attacks from those\r\nwhich follow their usual course. Liebermeister and Jaccoud state,\r\nhowever, that their commencement is usually more abrupt than in the\r\nordinary variety, the former asserting that the temperature generally\r\nreaches its maximum earlier, and the same opinion is expressed by\r\nother authors. They are occasionally characterized by severe symptoms,\r\nincluding a high temperature. In the few cases which have come under\r\nmy own observation the symptoms have been mild, but they were\r\nsufficiently developed to leave no doubt on the mind as to the nature\r\nof the disease. In a case which aborted on the twelfth day there were\r\nhebetude, diarrhoea, tympany, and rose-colored spots persisting even\r\nafter the subsidence of the fever. Constipation would appear, however,\r\nto be more frequent than diarrhoea in this class of cases. The\r\nsubsidence of the fever may occur at any time between the seventh and\r\nfourteenth days; Griesinger has seen it occur as early as the fifth\r\nday. Sometimes the defervescence occurs abruptly, with copious\r\nperspiration; at others it is gradual and similar to that which takes\r\nplace in ordinary attacks. Between the abortive form of typhoid fever\r\nand simple continued fever there are, of course, many points of\r\nresemblance, but cases of the former may generally be recognized by\r\nthe presence of this rose-colored eruption and enlargement of the\r\nspleen, or, where these are absent, by their occurring in the same\r\nhouse or under the same circumstances as typical cases of the disease.\r\n\r\nLiebermeister has called attention in his article on typhoid fever in\r\n_Ziemssen's Cyclopædia_ to a class of cases which, he thinks, is also\r\ncaused by the typhoid infection, and of which the prominent feature is\r\nthe insignificance of the fever or the entire absence of it which\r\ncharacterizes them. Such cases appear to be of frequent occurrence in\r\nBasle. Many of them, he says, never show during their entire course\r\nany rise of the temperature, or occasionally a slight elevation only,\r\nbut an enlargement of the spleen could generally be detected, and\r\noccasionally an unmistakable rose-colored eruption. The action of the\r\nbowels was usually irregular; sometimes there was diarrhoea, and\r\nsometimes, on the other hand, obstinate constipation. The other\r\nsymptoms were prostration, pains throughout the body, often headache,\r\npersistent loss of appetite, with more or less swollen and furred\r\ntongue, and markedly diminished frequency of the pulse, which\r\ndisappears with convalescence, while its quality is not appreciably\r\naltered. The long duration of an apparently trifling indisposition he\r\nconsiders as especially characteristic. Cayley also refers to cases,\r\nand even epidemics, of typhoid fever in which the temperature has been\r\nbelow the normal throughout the whole course of the attack. Strube[75]\r\nhad the opportunity of observing such an outbreak during the siege of\r\nParis by the Germans in 1870. \"In many of the cases,\" he says, \"the\r\ntemperature throughout was subnormal, and in others never exceeded the\r\nnormal point. The roseola was usually profuse; the nerve symptoms were\r\nof marked severity, and were in inverse ratio to the temperature,\r\nconsisting of violent delirium alternating with stupor; the duration\r\nof the fever was very short, defervescence usually taking place at the\r\nend of a fortnight. Of the 23 fatal cases, in 20 death took place\r\nduring the first fourteen days. The abdominal {300} symptoms were\r\nslight, but the characteristic lesions were found on post-mortem\r\nexamination. All the cases were characterized by great prostration.\r\nThese cases presented some features which were probably due to this\r\npeculiarity of the temperature; thus, the pulse was but little\r\naccelerated, seldom exceeding a hundred; the tongue did not become dry\r\nand brown; and the enlargement of the spleen was either absent or much\r\nless marked than usual. Strube attributed the peculiar features of\r\nthis epidemic to the depressed condition of the troops; they had been\r\nexposed to great hardships on the way to Paris, over-fatigued by\r\nforced marches, and very insufficiently supplied with food.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Quoted by Dr. Cayley.]\r\n\r\nA mild form of the disease has been described by certain authors, in\r\nwhich the symptoms, although not severe, are characteristic, and in\r\nwhich there is therefore, with due care, little danger of making a\r\nmistake in diagnosis. It therefore seems an unnecessary refinement to\r\nset apart such cases under a separate head.\r\n\r\nThe latent form, or the typhus ambulatorius of the Germans, is of more\r\nimportance from the fact that the symptoms are so mild, or that so\r\nmany of the ordinary symptoms are wanting or masked by those due to\r\ncomplications, that there is great danger of regarding the attack as\r\nof little moment. In many cases there is no symptom present but\r\nprostration and fever to indicate that the patient is ill, and these\r\nmay be so slight that he may positively refuse to go to his bed, and\r\nmay even insist upon pursuing his ordinary avocation, in the midst of\r\nwhich he is often suddenly seized with alarming symptoms, such as\r\nviolent delirium, intestinal hemorrhage, or, what is more common,\r\nthose due to perforation of the bowel. Still, even in these cases a\r\ncareful examination will often disclose the presence of some symptom\r\nwhich had failed before to attract attention, and which will often\r\nreveal to us the true nature of the disease. I was myself the subject\r\nof such an attack nearly twenty years ago. Supposing that the\r\nexcessive prostration from which I was suffering was due to overwork\r\nat a large army hospital in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, I\r\ndetermined to seek repose in travel and in change of scene. On the eve\r\nof doing so I fortunately sent for a medical friend, who, after a\r\nthorough investigation of my symptoms, succeeded in finding a few\r\nrose-colored spots upon my abdomen. The attack subsequently ran a mild\r\nbut well-marked course. Occasionally, the symptoms due to a\r\ncomplication so predominate over those arising from the disease itself\r\nthat they completely mask it. I have known bronchitis so severe as to\r\ndivert in this way the attention of a skilful diagnostician from the\r\nprimary disease. When vomiting, together with other symptoms of\r\nhepatic derangement, is especially prominent in the beginning of\r\ntyphoid fever, the mistake is not infrequently made of attributing\r\nthese symptoms to a \"bilious attack.\"\r\n\r\nTYPHO-MALARIAL FEVER.--Under this name, which was originally suggested\r\nby J. J. Woodward, Surgeon U.S.A., early in the summer of 1862, as a\r\ndesignation for a class of cases in which the symptoms of typhoid\r\nfever are associated with those of remittent, and which was especially\r\ncommon among the soldiers of the United States Army during the late\r\nCivil War, are probably included at least two distinct conditions:\r\n1st, remittent fever, in which the disease, on account of the\r\ndepressing circumstances surrounding the patient, assumes {301} a\r\ntyphoid form; and, 2d, typhoid fever, occurring in a patient who has\r\nalso been exposed to malarial influence. This association of diseases\r\nis of course not new, or even undescribed before this name was\r\nsuggested for it. Woodward thinks that he has found enough in the\r\ndescription of Röderer and Wagler to justify him in concluding that\r\nthe epidemic which occurred at Göttingen in 1762 was really of this\r\ncharacter. There would seem also to be no doubt from the descriptions\r\nof Dawson[76] and Davis[77] that the fever which decimated the British\r\narmy in the Walcheren expedition was typhoid fever, modified by the\r\nmalarial influence to which the soldiers were subjected. The latter of\r\nthese authors says that the ileum and jejunum in the bodies of those\r\nwho died of this disease were frequently found interspersed with\r\ntubercles, inflamed and ulcerated in different parts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Observations on the Walcheren Diseases_, Ipswich, 1810,\r\nby G. P. Dawson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _A Scientific and Popular View of the Fever of\r\nWalcheren_, J. B. Davis, London, 1810.]\r\n\r\nIn our own country the occasional association of these two diseases\r\nhas also long been recognized. Drake describes it under the name of\r\nremitto-typhoid, and Dickson seems to have been perfectly familiar\r\nwith it, for he says that typhoid lesions will sometimes be found in\r\nthe bodies of those dead of bilious remittent. Levick recognized the\r\npresence of the symptoms of both diseases in some patients who were\r\nunder his care as early as the spring of 1862, and proposed the name\r\nof miasmatic typhoid fever for this class of cases in the following\r\nJune.[78] Meredith Clymer has also frequently met with cases in which\r\nthe symptoms of the two diseases were coexistent.[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _Med. and Surg. Reporter_, June 21, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _The Science and Practice of Medicine_, by William\r\nAitken, M.D., 3d Amer. ed.; with additions by Meredith Clymer, M.D.,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1872.]\r\n\r\nAs is indicated by the name given to it, the symptoms in this form of\r\ntyphoid fever are modified by the presence of malarial poisoning. The\r\ncases always manifest a decided tendency to periodicity, the evening\r\nexacerbations are more decided than in the ordinary form, the\r\nremissions are often ushered in with a profuse sweating, gastric and\r\nhepatic derangements are more marked, and headache is more severe.\r\nThere is frequently less mental hebetude or dulness than in ordinary\r\ntyphoid fever. In some of the cases observed by Levick[80] the\r\nsymptoms were those of pernicious congestive remittent fever, such as\r\ncopious serous discharges, not unlike those of Asiatic cholera,\r\ncolliquative sweats, and other symptoms of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Amer. Journal of the Med. Sci._, April, 1864.]\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER IN CHILDREN.--It was formerly thought that infants and\r\nvery young children were not often the subjects of typhoid fever, but,\r\nso far is this opinion from being correct, it is now known that they\r\nare especially liable to suffer from it. The rose-colored eruption is\r\nmore often wanting in them than in adults, and the fever more apt to\r\nassume a distinctly remittent type; and hence, no doubt, the\r\ndifficulty which is often experienced in diagnosticating this fever\r\nfrom other forms of fever in children. There is no doubt that many\r\ncases which have been described by authors under the head of infantile\r\nremittent fever are really examples of typhoid fever modified simply\r\nby the age of the patient. It may occur in infants not more than six\r\nmonths old, and is not infrequent in {302} children of two or three\r\nyears of age. Henoch,[81] who has had the opportunity of observing a\r\nlarge number of cases, says that the rise of temperature is commonly\r\nmore abrupt in children than in adults, and that the disease generally\r\nruns its course in a shorter time. The pulse is more frequent, and may\r\nbe as high as 144 in cases in which the prognosis is not grave.\r\nDicrotism is very rare. Slowness and irregularity of the pulse, like\r\nthat observed in basillar meningitis, he has never seen. The nervous\r\nsymptoms are not so pronounced even when the temperature is high, and\r\nthey bear no relation in severity to the height of the temperature.\r\nDiarrhoea in the cases observed by Henoch was often absent during the\r\nwhole course of the attack, and the stools were often brownish or\r\ngreenish instead of yellow.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Charité Ann._, 1875.]\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER OF AGED PERSONS.--The modifications which the disease\r\nundergoes when it occurs in patients advanced in life are precisely\r\nthose to be expected from the diminished activity of the processes of\r\nlife in them, as compared with those of younger persons. The febrile\r\nmovement is generally prolonged, although of low grade, the\r\ntemperature rarely rising high, and frequently during convalescence\r\nsinking below the normal. The diarrhoea is commonly not so severe, the\r\ndelirium so violent, or the rose-colored eruption so often present. On\r\nthe other hand, adynamic symptoms, such as excessive prostration,\r\ntremors, subsultus tendinum, and the like, are frequently prominent\r\nfrom the beginning of the attack.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors, among whom may be mentioned Arnat,[82]\r\nHornburger,[83] and Greenhow,[84] have described a renal form of\r\ntyphoid fever. In this form the urine is blood red in color or like\r\ndark broth. It often contains albumen during the first week of this\r\ndisease, usually hyaline or more or less granular casts, and\r\noccasionally red blood-discs, white cells, epithelia of kidneys and\r\nbladder, and epithelial detritus. The specific gravity is high, and\r\nthe quantity is usually diminished. The prominent symptoms are pain in\r\nthe region of the kidneys, oedema of face, tense and frequent pulse,\r\ngreat prostration, profuse epistaxis, violent delirium, and\r\nhyperpyrexia. The temperature may be 105.8°. On the other hand, the\r\nintestinal symptoms are less marked. In fatal cases the lesions of\r\nintestinal nephritis have been found at the autopsy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Thesis, _Sur la Fievre typhoide à forme renale_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Berlin klin. Wochenschrift_, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Transactions of Clinical Society of London_, 1880.]\r\n\r\nRELAPSES.--Much difference of opinion will be found to exist among\r\nauthors in regard to the frequency with which relapses occur in\r\ntyphoid fever, and this difference does not appear to be due to any\r\ngreater frequency of this accident in some countries than in others,\r\nsince Liebermeister met with them in 8.6 per cent. of the cases\r\ntreated at the hospital at Basle, while, according to other German\r\nobservers quoted by him, they occur in 6.3 per cent. (Gerhardt), in 11\r\nper cent. (Bäumler), and in 3.3 per cent. (Biermer). Murchison noted\r\nthem in 80 of 2591 cases in the London Fever Hospital, or in 3 per\r\ncent., and Maclagan in 13 of 128 cases at Dundee, or in 10 per cent.\r\nabout. Immermann[85] of Basle says that they occur in 15 per cent. of\r\nthe cases, and that in very unfavorable years the proportion may be as\r\nhigh as 18 or 19 per cent. Prof. Henoch[86] observed relapses in 16\r\ncases out of 96, or 16.6 per cent. In my own {303} practice they have\r\nnot been very numerous. I find that in 80 cases of which I have full\r\nnotes they are recorded five times, or in 6.25 per cent., and I\r\nbelieve this ratio correctly represents the frequency with which they\r\nhave happened in all the other cases which have come under my care.\r\nPart of this difference of opinion is unquestionably attributable to\r\nthe fact that under the term relapse are sometimes included two\r\ndistinct conditions: (1) Mere recrudescences of fever, which occur\r\nduring the stage of defervescence or that of convalescence, and which\r\nare provoked by errors of diet, mental or bodily fatigue, or some\r\nother irritating cause. They usually last a day or two, and are\r\nentirely distinct from (2), true relapses, in which all the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of the primary attack are reproduced, and\r\nwhich commonly occur some time after the disease has apparently run\r\nits course. There is occasionally no distinct apyretic interval\r\nbetween the two attacks, but in by far the greater number of instances\r\nthe relapse occurs in the second or third week, or even later, after\r\nthe establishment of convalescence. In 20 cases reported by W. M. Ord\r\nand Seymour Taylor[87] the relapse occurred in the third week of the\r\ndisease in 1; in the fourth week in 5; in the sixth week in 3; in the\r\nseventh week in 7; in the eighth week in 3; in the ninth week in 1.\r\nJames Jackson refers to a case in which the date of the relapse is not\r\ngiven, but in which he was able to detect the rose-colored eruption in\r\nthe sixty-sixth day[88] from the commencement of the disease. In my\r\nfive cases the relapse occurred on the seventh, eighth, ninth,\r\neleventh, and twentieth day after the apparent establishment of\r\nconvalescence. In these cases the duration of the relapse was 11, 13,\r\n17, 20, and 13 days respectively. The highest temperature noted in any\r\nof the relapses was 105°, which occurred in two cases. In both of\r\nthese this temperature had also occurred in the original attacks. In\r\none of the others, however, a temperature of over 104° F. was\r\nrepeatedly observed in the relapse, while in the primary attack it had\r\nnever risen above 102°.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _Schweiz. Corr. Bl._, viii. 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Charité Ann._, ii. 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _St. Thomas's Hospital Report_, vol. ix., London, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Since the above was written I have had under my care a\r\ncase of typhoid fever in which a third relapse occurred nearly four\r\nmonths after the patient, a woman aged thirty years, was first taken\r\nill. The following is a brief abstract of the history of this\r\nremarkable case: The original attack began about Sept. 20, 1883, was\r\nof moderate severity, and lasted between three and four weeks.\r\nConvalescence, which seems to have been nearly complete, as the\r\npatient had left her bed, was interrupted on Nov. 1st by a relapse,\r\nduring which she was admitted into the Pennsylvania Hospital. This\r\nrelapse was severe, and before it had entirely run its course was\r\nitself interrupted, on Nov. 17th, by an intercurrent relapse, which\r\nlasted two weeks. During these two relapses extensive bed-sores formed\r\nupon the nates, occasioning more or less irritation and consequent\r\nfebrile reaction. On Jan. 11, 1884, a third relapse occurred. This\r\nrelapse was accompanied by diarrhoea, rose-colored spots, tympany, dry\r\nand brown tongue, and other characteristic symptoms of typhoid fever,\r\nthe diagnosis being fully concurred in by my colleague, Dr. Morris\r\nLongstreth, who saw the case with me. Convalescence was again\r\ninterrupted on Feb. 13th by fever, which continued for two weeks, but\r\nwhich possessed none of the characters of typhoid fever, and was\r\nclearly due to imprudence on the part of the patient. The patient is\r\nnow (April 25, 1884) entirely well, and will shortly be discharged\r\nfrom the hospital.]\r\n\r\nThe onset of a relapse is usually much more abrupt than that of the\r\noriginal attack. It is rarely preceded by prodromata. The temperature\r\nrises more rapidly and attains its maximum earlier, which may be much\r\ngreater than in the original attack. In one case under my care it\r\nreached 105° on the evening of the first day, and temperatures of\r\n103.5° and 104° on the evening of the second day are not infrequent.\r\n\r\n{304} The rose-colored eruption appears earlier. In 38 cases\r\ninvestigated by Murchison with reference to this point, it appeared on\r\nthe third day in 7; on the fourth in 8; on the fifth in 7; on the\r\nsixth in 2; on the seventh in 12; and at a later date in 2. In the\r\ncase the history of which is given below it was detected on the second\r\nday. The delirium also comes on sooner. The relapse is usually less\r\nsevere, and is of shorter duration, than the primary attack. All my\r\ncases terminated in recovery. Occasionally, however, it is much more\r\nsevere. In one case in which the primary attack was so mild that the\r\npatient could scarcely be persuaded to remain in bed, the relapse was\r\nso severe that for many days it was uncertain whether the patient\r\nwould recover. In another intestinal hemorrhages to an alarming extent\r\noccurred on two occasions. Moreover, of Murchison's 53 cases, 7 were\r\nfatal; in 2 of the cases death was due to perforation; in 2 to\r\nperitonitis, induced by infarction of the spleen; and in 1 to\r\nabortion; and of Ebstein's 13 cases, 3 were also fatal. Occasionally,\r\na second, and it is said even a third, relapse is noted. In one of Da\r\nCosta's cases hemorrhage from the bowels took place during a second\r\nrelapse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Pulse.]\r\n\r\nThe following histories and temperature charts illustrate the\r\nprominent peculiarities of relapses occurring in typhoid fever:\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER (with a relapse).--G---- L----, æt. 20, single, seaman,\r\nItalian, admitted March 6, 1878; April 30, 1878, left in ward. Patient\r\nis unable to speak English. The following history is obtained through\r\nan interpreter: His family history is good, and he is naturally a\r\nhealthy man, never having had any serious illness--no venereal\r\ndisease, no cough or rheumatism, no intermittent fever, and he has not\r\nbeen in the habit of drinking to excess. His vessel has been lying off\r\nGloucester Point, and two seamen have recently been similarly affected\r\non another vessel anchored near by. For about two weeks he has had\r\nmalaise, but not until three days ago was he so ill that he was\r\nobliged to give up work. He was then taken with cough, chills followed\r\nby fever, diarrhoea, headache, and pain in the abdomen. Has had no\r\nepistaxis or vomiting.\r\n\r\nUpon admission patient has fever, his face is flushed, his tongue\r\ncoated with a brown fur in the centre, dry, fissured, and red and\r\nglossy at the tip and edges. He has hebetude and some delirium, though\r\nnot very active; he is deaf. His abdomen is somewhat tense and\r\ntympanitic, and covered with very numerous rose-colored spots, which\r\ndisappear momentarily on pressure; they are also distributed over\r\nthighs and chest. There seems to be no tenderness on pressure over\r\nabdomen, and there is no gurgling felt. Has moderate diarrhoea, having\r\nabout three stools daily, which are light yellow in color and are\r\nloose and fetid. Urine cloudy orange red, acid, 1021. No albumen.\r\n\r\n{305} _3.7_. Ord. Ol.

Tongue is not so dry, and is cleaner. The spots over his body\r\nare beginning to assume more the appearance of petechiæ. They are\r\nfound everywhere on his body. Has had but one stool within the last\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n_3.13_. He is brighter; skin feels better; tongue cleaner; pulse but\r\n80. Fewer râles heard in chest. No change in his treatment.\r\n\r\n_3.14_. Spots disappearing. Two stools in last twenty-four hours, not\r\nso loose in character. Pulse dicrotic.\r\n\r\n_3.15_. There is no tympany.

Has been up for a week, and steadily gaining in strength,\r\nexcept the slight attack on the 4th, when to-day, without his having\r\ntaken any indigestible food, or indeed any reason to which it could be\r\nassigned, he was seized with a relapse, his temperature rising to\r\n105°, but being reduced a half degree by sponging.\r\n\r\n_4.9_. Spots have again appeared in great numbers, and they are very\r\nlarge. Last evening his temperature reached 104-3/4°, and was reduced\r\nto 101° by sponging.\r\n\r\n_4.10_. Doing very well; spots are still making their appearance.\r\n\r\n_4.12_. Diarrhoea not at all excessive.\r\n\r\n_4.15_. Spots are very numerous.\r\n\r\n_4.20_.

Admitted {307} January 25,\r\n1883; discharged March 26, 1883, cured. Father died of hemorrhage from\r\nthe lungs; mother living and healthy. Two years ago he sustained a\r\ncompound fracture of the left leg from a bale of cotton falling on\r\nhim; otherwise he has always enjoyed good health. For the past three\r\nmonths he has been assisting the nurse in the receiving ward of this\r\nhospital. Four days before admission, without unusual exposure, he had\r\na slight chill, and felt cold for several hours. This was followed by\r\nfever and a feeling of weakness. He also had slight headache and the\r\nbowels were constipated; no epistaxis.\r\n\r\nUpon admission patient has a good deal of hebetude, face flushed,\r\ntemperature 102°, pulse 106, tongue slightly coated, moist. Has slight\r\npain in right lumbar region, but no distension of abdomen. Urine\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nOrd. quinine gr. viij. daily; liq. ammon. acet. fl. drachms ij. q.q.h.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 29th_. More hebetude; tongue more coated with brownish fur, red\r\nat tip; bowels continue costive; opened by an enema.\r\n\r\n_31st_. Is brighter and better. One doubtful rose-colored spot seen on\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 4th_. The morning temperatures for the past two days have been\r\nsubnormal and the evening rise is very slight. All the symptoms also\r\nindicate the approach of convalescence.\r\n\r\n_6th_. More fever; pulse weaker; functional murmur heard over heart;\r\nsudamina out over abdomen. Ord. whiskey fl. oz. ij.\r\n\r\n_8th_. Some fulness of abdomen; had three loose yellowish-colored\r\nstools in the last twelve hours.\r\n\r\n_9th_. A few doubtful rose spots out over abdomen and back; sudamina\r\nstill abundant.\r\n\r\n_10th_. More tympany; numerous rose-colored spots out over abdomen and\r\nback; slight epistaxis and bronchitis.\r\n\r\n_11th_. Pulse more feeble; still slight diarrhoea. Increase whiskey to\r\nfl. oz. iv.\r\n\r\n_15th_. Has a good deal of hebetude, but no headache; fewer spots;\r\npulse weaker; temperature lower. Increase whiskey to fl. oz. vj.\r\n\r\n_17th_. Temperature high again; most of the spots have disappeared;\r\nslight epistaxis and subsultus; no delirium; bowels not open for two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_20th_. Temperature falling; spots disappearing; still fulness of\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n_25th_. Temperature has been subnormal for several days, and he is\r\ndoing well; tongue cleaning. Has emaciated a good deal, and is weak.\r\n\r\n_March 1st_. Is convalescent; tongue has lost its redness.\r\n\r\n_8th_. Continues to improve; allowed semi-solid food.\r\n\r\n_17th_. Is now quite well; has gained a good deal in flesh, and is\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\n{308} [Illustration: FIG. 18. Temperature chart of typhoid\r\nfever.--Abortive attack, followed by typical attack.]\r\n\r\nThe examination of the bodies of those who have died during a relapse\r\nreveals the presence of two sets of lesions in the cicatrizing ulcers\r\nof the primary attack and the recent ulcerations of the relapse. The\r\nlatter are usually less extensive, and are found to be situated at a\r\ngreater distance from the lower end of the small intestine, than the\r\nformer, for the reason that the Peyer's patches most remote from the\r\nileo-cæcal valve are least apt to be affected in the primary attack.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory explanation of these relapses has as yet been\r\ndiscovered. {309} They occur in patients of both sexes and of all ages\r\nwith about the same frequency. They have been attributed to errors of\r\ndiet, mental and bodily fatigue, and the like, but, while we know that\r\ncauses of this character often provoke recrudescences of fever, and\r\ncan understand that they may act as exciting causes of a relapse in\r\ncases in which the predisposition exists, it does not seem possible\r\nthat they should by themselves be able to bring back all the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of a specific disease. It has been maintained\r\nby some authors that a relapse indicates that a new infection has\r\ntaken place; but this hypothesis, even if we admit that it accounts\r\nfor those cases in which the patient is allowed to remain in the place\r\nin which he has acquired the disease, does not explain those in which\r\nhe is removed during the first attack to a hospital where all the\r\nsanitary arrangements are presumably perfect. Griesinger has\r\nendeavored to explain relapses occurring in hospitals by suggesting\r\nthat they may possibly be due to a fresh contagion from other patients\r\nwith typhoid fever in the same ward; but this explanation is rendered\r\nimprobable by the fact that relapses have occurred when cases have\r\nbeen thoroughly isolated. As I have already said, during a long\r\nconnection with the Pennsylvania Hospital I have only known a single\r\ncase of typhoid fever to originate within its walls, although relapses\r\nprobably occur in its wards with the same frequency as in other\r\nhospitals. To adopt Griesinger's explanation, it would therefore be\r\nnecessary to assume that a patient just recovered from an attack of\r\nthe disease is more susceptible to the action of its contagion than\r\npatients suffering from other disease; which seems improbable, to say\r\nthe least. It has also been maintained that relapses are due to the\r\ninoculation of the previously healthy Peyer's patches by the typhoid\r\npoison which is thrown off with the sloughs from those first affected.\r\nMaclagan alleges that relapses are more frequently met with in cases\r\nin which constipation is present in the primary attack, a condition\r\nwhich he regards as favorable to absorption; but this is opposed to\r\nthe experience of almost every one who has paid any attention to the\r\nsubject. In the cases which have come under my own observation it\r\ncertainly was not the case, diarrhoea having been present in all of\r\nthem. It is more likely, as suggested by Liebermeister, that part of\r\nthe poison remains latent somewhere in the body, not developed,\r\ndestroyed, nor expelled during the first attack, but brought later\r\ninto activity by some exciting cause. Da Costa adopts this view, and\r\nsays that relapses of typhoid fever are not unlike the outbreaks of\r\nmalarial fever which occur after worry or fatigue and when there has\r\nbeen no chance for a fresh infection. Different plans of treatment\r\nhave at various times been charged with increasing the predisposition\r\nto relapses. This is especially true of the cold-water treatment, and\r\nthe records at the hospital at Basle show that the proportion of\r\nrelapses and the number of deaths from them are both increased under\r\nthe use of cold water. Liebermeister thinks, however, that this does\r\nnot necessarily prove that this treatment favors the occurrence of\r\nrelapses, since before the introduction of this plan of treatment many\r\nmore typhoid fever patients died in the first attack of the disease.\r\nEmploying those cases only for statistical purposes in which the\r\npatients have survived the first attack, he finds that the difference\r\nat once disappears, there being 9 per cent. of relapses before the use\r\nof cold water, and 10.3 per cent. after its use.\r\n\r\n{310} Gerhardt[89] asserts that in cases in which relapses occur the\r\nenlargement of the spleen does not diminish during the non-febrile\r\nperiod that intervenes between the original attack and the relapse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Ziemssen's Cyclopædia_, vol. i. p. 193.]\r\n\r\nDa Costa[90] has shown that the appearance of the white line and\r\nfurrow left by the primary attack, to which attention has already been\r\ndrawn, may sometimes be of service to us in diagnosis when we see the\r\npatient for the first time during the relapse. In a case which was\r\nrecently under my care their appearance certainly rendered the nature\r\nof the previous illness from which the patient had suffered much\r\nclearer than it would otherwise have been.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _Transactions of the College of Physicians of\r\nPhiladelphia_, 3d S., vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nDURATION.--The mode of invasion of typhoid fever is generally so\r\ninsidious, and the first symptoms so little pronounced, that the\r\npatient, even if free from mental hebetude and confusion at the time\r\nwhen he first comes under the care of a physician, is usually unable\r\nto fix with certainty the time of the beginning of his illness. This\r\ninability is of course most marked in what are known as walking cases,\r\nin which, notwithstanding that the disease is far advanced, the\r\npatient continues to pursue his ordinary avocations or at least\r\nrefuses to go to bed. In a few cases, however, either in consequence\r\nof the violence of the first symptoms or from some other cause,\r\nopportunity is afforded to the physician of observing the disease from\r\nits onset. In many others the date of commencement may be\r\napproximately ascertained. The average duration of such cases, if\r\nuncomplicated, has been found to be between three and four weeks.\r\nAccording to Bartlett, the average duration of 255 cases at the\r\nMassachusetts General Hospital between the years 1824 and 1835,\r\ninclusive, was twenty-two days. It was a little less than this in\r\npatients under twenty-one years of age, and a little more in those\r\nover. As these cases occurred before the introduction into use of the\r\nclinical thermometer, and as the commencement of convalescence is\r\nfixed in them at the time when the patients were able to take a little\r\nsolid food, it is possible the fever may have continued in them some\r\ntime after convalescence was supposed to have been established. Of 200\r\ncases which ended in recovery, and in which Murchison was able to\r\nascertain with precision the date of commencement, the duration was 10\r\nto 14 days in 7 cases, 15 to 21 days in 49 cases, 22 to 28 days in 111\r\ncases, and 29 to 35 days in 33 cases. The mean duration of these 200\r\ncases was 24.3 days, while that of 112 fatal cases was 27.67 days.\r\nFrom the same author we learn that the average stay in hospital of 500\r\ncases which recovered was 31.24 days, and of 100 fatal cases was 16.52\r\ndays, while the average duration of the illness before admission in\r\nthe 600 cases was 10.78 days. During the twenty years from Jan. 1,\r\n1862, to Dec. 31, 1881, 621 cases of typhoid fever, 121 of which were\r\nfatal, were admitted into the Pennsylvania Hospital. No notes of many\r\nof these cases were taken, and of some of the others the notes are\r\nincomplete or inaccessible, so that they cannot, unfortunately, be\r\nused for the purpose of determining the duration of the disease. The\r\nbooks of the hospital, however, show the length of time each patient\r\nremained in the wards. From these we learn that the average stay of\r\nthe 500 patients who recovered was 43.5 days, while that of the 121\r\npatients who died was only 8.75 days, and that of these a large number\r\n(28) died within {311} 48 hours after their admission to the hospital.\r\nAs a rule, patients are retained at the Pennsylvania Hospital until\r\nthey are fully able to return to work, while at the English and\r\ncontinental hospitals it is usual to discharge them when they cease to\r\nneed active treatment. This circumstance probably explains the much\r\ngreater average duration of the cases admitted to the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital than that of the cases referred to by Murchison. In the\r\nabortive form the duration of the disease may not exceed ten days, and\r\nthere are authors who contend that it may occasionally be very much\r\nless.\r\n\r\nDeath may occur at almost any time in the course of typhoid fever. I\r\nhave never seen it myself take place before the seventh day. Murchison\r\nreports two cases in one of which the disease terminated fatally\r\nwithin twenty-seven hours of its commencement, and in the other on the\r\nsecond day. Instances are more numerous in which death has occurred on\r\nthe fourth, fifth, or sixth day, but still they are comparatively\r\ninfrequent, and, as a rule, the fatal termination takes place most\r\nfrequently during the course of the third week. On the other hand,\r\ndeath may sometimes occur at a very much later period. This is, of\r\ncourse, the case when it occurs during a relapse, but if the fever\r\ncontinues after the third week the patient may sometimes die from\r\nexhaustion or from the intercurrence of a complication. Death may also\r\nbe the result of a sequela long after the disease has run its course.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The insidious invasion of typhoid fever, together with the\r\nabsence of pathognomonic symptoms in the beginning, always renders the\r\ndiagnosis difficult, and sometimes impossible, during the first week.\r\nStill, even at this time the existence of the disease may be suspected\r\nif the frequent use of the thermometer reveals from day to day a\r\ngradual increase of the fever and the existence of evening\r\nexacerbations followed by morning remissions, the temperature rising\r\neach evening from a degree to two degrees higher than it had done the\r\npreceding evening. If in addition to this character of the pyrexia\r\nthere are diarrhoea with ochrey-yellow stools or an increased\r\nsusceptibility to the action of cathartic medicines, epistaxis,\r\nenlargement of the spleen, slight fulness of the abdomen, with\r\ntenderness and gurgling in the right iliac region, slight hebetude and\r\nsome confusion of ideas upon awakening, the diagnosis becomes more\r\nprobable. During the next week the symptoms are usually much more\r\ncharacteristic. The presence of marked abdominal symptoms, together\r\nwith the eruption of rose-colored spots, will generally render the\r\nrecognition of the disease at this time an easy matter. There are,\r\nhowever, a few cases in which no rose-colored spots can be found, and\r\nin which the abdominal symptoms, if they exist at all, are so little\r\nmarked that they do not arrest attention. Even in these cases the\r\ntemperature record, when carefully studied, will often throw a good\r\ndeal of light upon the nature of the disease. If the febrile movement\r\nresembles that usual in typhoid fever, if it has continued for more\r\nthan a week, if the patient has not been recently exposed to malarial\r\ninfluences, and presents no symptoms of local disease, the diagnosis\r\nmay still be made with at least an approach to certainty.\r\n\r\nThe following are the diseases which are most likely to be mistaken\r\nfor typhoid fever:\r\n\r\nTyphus fever has a course which is so essentially different from {312}\r\nthat of typhoid that in well-marked cases it would scarcely be\r\npossible to mistake one for the other. Cases, however, do occur which,\r\nin consequence of a very profuse and dark-colored eruption in the\r\nlatter, or of the existence of abdominal symptoms in the former,\r\npresent at first a good deal of difficulty in diagnosis. The invasion\r\nof the former is more abrupt and its duration shorter than in typhoid\r\nfever. The eruption is usually also much more copious, and appears in\r\nthe former as early as the fourth, fifth, or sixth day, while that of\r\nthe latter is rarely observed before the seventh day. The fever in the\r\nformer is much more nearly continued in type than that of the latter.\r\nDefervescence occurs in the former by crisis; in the latter, by lysis.\r\nThe expression of the physiognomy is different in the two diseases. In\r\ntyphus there is a uniform dusky hue of the face, with injection of the\r\nconjunctivæ and contraction of the pupils. In typhoid fever the pupils\r\nare often widely dilated, the conjunctivæ clear, and the face pallid,\r\nwith the exception of a circumscribed flush on each cheek. Diarrhoea\r\nis much less frequent in the former than in the latter, and when it\r\ndoes occur is not accompanied by ochrey-yellow stools. Epistaxis,\r\ntympanites, pain, and gurgling in the right iliac region, and\r\nintestinal hemorrhage, common symptoms in the latter, are very\r\ninfrequently met with in the former. On the other hand, petechiæ and\r\nvibices, which are of almost constant occurrence in the former, are\r\nrarely met with in the latter. The circumstances also under which the\r\ntwo diseases are contracted are different. Typhus originates from\r\novercrowding or is due to direct contagion. The origin of typhoid\r\nfever is often involved in more obscurity, but it can generally be\r\ntraced either to a polluted water-supply or to defective drainage.\r\n\r\nRelapsing fever, with due care, is not likely to be confounded with\r\ntyphoid fever. The abrupt commencement of the former, the high fever,\r\nlasting for from five to seven days only, and terminating by crisis\r\nwith a profuse sweat, and the period of complete apyrexia of a week's\r\nduration, followed by the relapse in which the temperature rises even\r\nhigher than in the primary paroxysm, and which also terminates by\r\ncrisis, form a chain of symptoms which has no counterpart in the\r\nlatter. The mind in relapsing fever is usually clear, there being none\r\nof the hebetude and mental confusion commonly observed in typhoid\r\nfever. The rose-colored eruption is, moreover, wanting, and diarrhoea\r\nand tympanites are absent. On the other hand, jaundice and tenderness\r\nin the epigastric zone are more common than in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nInfluenza sometimes, Murchison says, when epidemic, closely simulates\r\ntyphoid fever, but as the two diseases occur in this country the\r\nresemblance between them is not often sufficiently strong to lead the\r\ncareful observer astray. In both there are fever, prostration,\r\nsleeplessness, delirium and sweating, and occasionally deafness,\r\ndiarrhoea, epistaxis, and a dry red tongue; but the onset of the\r\nattack in the former is more abrupt, its duration shorter, and\r\nsubsequent convalescence more rapid than in typhoid fever. The\r\nprostration, too, is more decided in proportion to the degree of fever\r\npresent. Coryza and bronchial catarrh are much more marked symptoms in\r\nthe former than in the latter, while hyperæsthesia of the surface,\r\nwhich is present in almost every case of influenza, is only rarely met\r\nwith in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nRemittent and typhoid fevers often prevail together in the malarious\r\n{313} districts of this country, and, as they present many points of\r\nresemblance, they are sometimes with difficulty distinguished from\r\neach other. They both may begin with nausea and vomiting; abdominal\r\nand cerebral symptoms are common to both, and so is enlargement of the\r\nspleen. The typhoid state may supervene in either, and in both the\r\nfebrile movement is remittent in character. In remittent fever,\r\nhowever, the remissions are more marked, and are usually accompanied\r\nwith more profuse sweating, than in typhoid fever. Jaundice and other\r\nsymptoms of hepatic derangement are also more common, and the pains in\r\nthe back and limbs are more frequent and more severe. The effect, too,\r\nof quinine in producing a permanent reduction of the temperature, is\r\ngenerally more decided. On the other hand, the rose-colored eruption\r\nof typhoid fever is never present in pure remittent fever.\r\nOccasionally, in cases of the variety of typhoid fever known as\r\ntypho-malarial fever, the symptoms of the latter may be so prominent\r\nas entirely to mask those of the former. In such cases the discovery\r\nof a few rose-colored spots somewhere on the surface will clearly\r\nreveal the true nature of the disease.\r\n\r\nEpidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis differs from typhoid fever by its\r\nmore abrupt invasion, by the retraction of the head which rapidly\r\nsupervenes, and by the appearance a short time afterward upon\r\ndifferent parts of the body of petechiæ, which are not likely, even at\r\nfirst, to be mistaken for the rose-colored spots of typhoid fever. The\r\nfever has, moreover, no constant character, but is remarkable, on the\r\ncontrary, for its great irregularity. The duration of the disease is\r\nin fatal cases much shorter, death taking place not infrequently\r\nwithin the first week, and occasionally as early as the second or\r\nthird day. On the other hand, the duration in cases which recover may\r\nbe even longer than in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nSimple continued fever may readily be mistaken in the beginning for\r\ntyphoid fever, especially in those cases complicated by diarrhoea,\r\nbut, as a general rule, the different character of the febrile\r\nmovement, its more abrupt commencement and termination, and its\r\nshorter duration, together with the absence of the rose-colored\r\neruption, will usually serve to distinguish it.\r\n\r\nThe eruptive fevers are always readily distinguishable at the period\r\nof invasion from typhoid fever, and the mistake of confounding them\r\nwith the latter disease may generally be avoided by a close study of\r\nthe character of the pyrexia. In the eruptive fevers the temperature\r\nrises abruptly, frequently attaining its maximum in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours, and sometimes in very much less time. There are\r\nalso in all of them early symptoms which indicate pretty clearly their\r\ntrue nature, as, for instance, the sore throat of scarlatina, the\r\nnaso-pulmonary catarrh of measles, and the rachialgia of small-pox.\r\nThe uncertainty, moreover, is of short duration, as the characteristic\r\neruption appears in all of them before the fourth day.\r\n\r\nAcute tuberculosis of the lungs is the condition which in my\r\nexperience has been the most difficult to distinguish from typhoid\r\nfever. Indeed, in some cases which have come under my observation\r\nphysicians of recognized skill as diagnosticians have been unable to\r\nmake the discrimination until after the death of the patient. Muscular\r\nprostration, a dry brown tongue, delirium, stupor, bronchitic râles,\r\ndyspnoea, and even cyanosis, are symptoms frequently met with in both\r\ndiseases, so that when the {314} rose-colored eruption and enlargement\r\nof the spleen happen to be wanting in typhoid fever, or diarrhoea and\r\ntympany present in acute tuberculosis, as they may be, the distinction\r\nis often impossible. The diagnosis may, however, even in these cases,\r\nbe sometimes made after a careful study of the temperature range,\r\nwhich in acute tuberculosis is irregular and rarely presents any\r\nresemblance to that which is typical of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nAcute tubercular meningitis has also many symptoms in common with\r\ntyphoid fever, such as high fever, headache, vomiting, delirium, and\r\nstupor, but in the former disease the rose-colored eruption,\r\nepistaxis, enlargement of the spleen, and intestinal hemorrhage do not\r\noccur. Diarrhoea is also rare, and the abdomen, instead of being\r\ntympanitic, is flat, and in many cases even scaphoid. The headache,\r\ntoo, is much more acute than in typhoid fever, and is very apt to be\r\nassociated with retraction of the head. Here, again, the frequent use\r\nof the thermometer will yield very important results in diagnosis, as\r\nthe temperature range in tubercular meningitis is always irregular and\r\ndoes not present any resemblance to that usually observed in typhoid\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the inflammations, especially when associated with the\r\ntyphoid state, have so many symptoms in common with typhoid fever that\r\nthey may very readily be mistaken for one another by a careless\r\nobserver. I have known, for instance, the general disease to be\r\nentirely overlooked in a case of typhoid fever complicated by\r\npneumonia, and, on the other hand, it has sometimes been supposed to\r\nbe present in a case of pure typhoid pneumonia. Gastro-enteritis is\r\nanother disease which is also occasionally confounded with typhoid\r\nfever. The diagnosis in these cases will rest principally upon the\r\npresence or absence of epistaxis, enlargement of the spleen,\r\ntympanites, the rose-colored eruption, and of a temperature range\r\npresenting some similarity to that usual in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nTrichiniasis is not likely to give rise to much difficulty in\r\ndiagnosis, for although vomiting, diarrhoea, and the typhoid state\r\noccur in it as well as in typhoid fever, the former disease may\r\nusually be recognized by the severe muscular pains and the local\r\noedema which are constant accompaniments of it, and by the absence of\r\nthe characteristic symptoms of the latter.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--There is no other disease in which the physician should be\r\nmore careful in making a positive prognosis than in typhoid fever. On\r\nthe one hand, accidents of a fatal character frequently occur in cases\r\nwhich are apparently progressing favorably, and, on the other,\r\nrecovery has often taken place after all hope of it had been\r\nabandoned. But, although it is impossible to foretell with absolute\r\ncertainty the result in any particular case, there are certain\r\nsymptoms which furnish very important indications for prognosis, and\r\nthe proper appreciation of which will generally enable us to arrive at\r\na correct conclusion as regards the gravity of the disease. Prominent\r\namong these is the character of the pyrexia. A fever characterized by\r\nhigh temperature should always give occasion for great anxiety. This\r\nis very fully shown by the statistics of the hospital at Basle. Thus\r\nof those patients in whom the temperature did not reach 104°, only 9.6\r\nper cent. died; of those in which it reached or exceeded 104°, 29.1\r\nper cent. died; and, finally, of those in whose axilla the temperature\r\nrose to or above 105.8°, more than half died. {315} Wunderlich has\r\narrived at very nearly the same conclusions, for he says that the\r\nprognosis is very unfavorable when the temperature rises to 106.16°,\r\nthat the deaths are almost twice as numerous as the recoveries when it\r\nrises to 107.06°, and that recoveries are rare when it rises to\r\n107.24°. Murchison has, however, known recovery to follow a\r\ntemperature of 108°. The highest temperature recorded in any of my\r\ncases was 106° F. In this case, which proved fatal, the temperature\r\nreached 105° F. five times. In three other cases, in all of which\r\nrecovery took place, a temperature of 105.5° F. was observed. In\r\ntwelve cases the temperature reached 105° F. on more than one\r\noccasion. Six of these ended fatally; in the others the patients\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is more unfavorable in a fever in which the temperature\r\nis continuously high, and in which the morning remissions are slight\r\nor wanting, than in one in which the daily fluctuations are greater,\r\neven though the temperature may reach a higher point during the\r\nevening exacerbations in the latter variety than is attained at any\r\ntime in the former. Occasional remissions, even if produced by quinia\r\nor other remedies, are to be regarded as favorable omens, as they\r\nindicate that the fever tends to subside. A high morning temperature\r\nought, therefore, to give rise to more alarm than a high evening\r\ntemperature. The prognosis is grave when the morning temperature rises\r\nto 104° or is persistently above 103°. Murchison says that recovery is\r\nrare after a morning temperature of 105°. Fiedler[91] saw, with a\r\nsingle exception, all patients die whose temperature in the morning\r\nrose to or exceeded 106.25°, while of those whose temperature in the\r\nmorning rose to 105.44°, if only on one day, more than half died. Any\r\nmarked deviation from the usual temperature range in the course of the\r\nfever is unfavorable. A rapid rise of temperature indicates increased\r\ndanger: it may be due to the occurrence of a complication or of some\r\nother cause acting unfavorably upon the patient. A sudden and decided\r\nfall should excite even more alarm, as it is generally the consequence\r\nof a free intestinal hemorrhage. A temporary abatement of the fever,\r\nwith amelioration of the other symptoms, occurring between the tenth\r\nand twentieth days, and giving rise to the hope that convalescence is\r\nabout to commence, but followed by a return of the symptoms in an\r\naggravated form, is also unfavorable. Such cases, according to Chomel,\r\nLouis, Bartlett, and Murchison, almost invariably terminate fatally.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Quoted by Liebermeister.]\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is bad in cases in which coma or wild or violent\r\ndelirium comes on early. A moderate amount of delirium, especially\r\nwhen it occurs only at night or upon wakening in the morning, and is\r\nreadily dissipated by attracting the patient's attention, or stupor\r\nwhich disappears when he is thoroughly roused, is not unfavorable.\r\nInsomnia, subsultus tendinum, carphologia, slipping down in bed,\r\nincontinence of the urine or feces, and retention of urine, are all\r\nsymptoms of bad omen. Rigidity of the limbs is also a bad symptom; Dr.\r\nJackson reports six cases in which this symptom occurred, only one of\r\nwhich recovered. Excessive subsultus is especially unfavorable, as it\r\nis generally most marked in cases in which the ulcerations of the\r\nintestines are most extensive. Extreme deafness occurs in mild as well\r\nas severe cases; it is therefore without significance in prognosis.\r\n\r\n{316} In estimating the importance, in a prognostic point of view, of\r\nthese various nervous symptoms, it is important to bear in mind that a\r\ndegree of fever which produces no disturbance of the mental functions\r\nin a phlegmatic person will give rise to active delirium and other\r\nmarked cerebral symptoms in a person of an excitable temperament.\r\n\r\nA change in the character of the pulse and of the action of the heart\r\nis often the earliest indication of the approach of danger in typhoid\r\nfever, and both pulse and heart should therefore be carefully examined\r\nat every visit. The first change is usually a diminution in the\r\nintensity of the first sound of the heart. This is significant, as it\r\nis frequently the earliest premonition of cardiac failure, to which a\r\nlarge proportion of the deaths in typhoid fever is due. A pulse of 120\r\nand over, especially if it is at the same time feeble, is also\r\nunfavorable. The important part which the frequency of the pulse plays\r\nin the prognosis is shown by the following observations made by\r\nLiebermeister at the hospital in Basle: Of 63 cases in which the pulse\r\nrose to or above 120, 40 were fatal, or nearly two-thirds. Among these\r\n63 were 37 in which it did not rise to 140; of these, 19 were fatal,\r\nor about one-half; in 26 it rose above 140; of these, 21, or about\r\nfour-fifths, were fatal. In 12 patients it rose above 150; of these,\r\n11 died. Of those in which the pulse rose to 160, the only case that\r\nended in recovery was that of a girl twenty-one years old suffering\r\nfrom an imperfectly developed typhoid. Intermittence of the pulse is\r\nunfavorable, especially, according to Hayem,[92] when it occurs during\r\nthe first week of the disease. In convalescence intermittence is not\r\nto be regarded as an unfavorable symptom. The prognosis is bad also in\r\nthose cases in which, with excessive weakness of the pulse, there are\r\nother evidences of cardiac failure, as, for instance, congestion of\r\nthe lungs, cyanosis of the surface, coldness of the extremities. A\r\nvery frequent pulse is not so unfavorable in a child as in an adult,\r\nor in a person of a nervous temperament as in one of a different\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nOther unfavorable symptoms are a dry, brown tongue, excessive\r\ntympanites with great abdominal tenderness, severe diarrhoea, vomiting\r\nwhen it occurs late in the disease, intestinal hemorrhage, and\r\ncolliquative sweats. The delusion sometimes observed in very severe\r\ncases, in which the patient declares that he is not ill, is a very bad\r\nsign, many authors, and among them Louis, asserting that they have\r\nnever known recovery to take place after it has been manifested.\r\nPeritonitis is a very serious complication, whether due to perforation\r\nor to some other cause. Still, it would appear not to be invariably\r\nfatal, since recovery has occurred in cases in which all the symptoms\r\nof this complication were present.\r\n\r\nFavorable symptoms, on the other hand, are a gradual decrease of the\r\ntemperature with increasing morning remissions, moistening and\r\ncleansing of the tongue, a lessening of the delirium, and other\r\nnervous symptoms, reappearance of an intelligent expression,\r\nrecognition by the patient of friends and attendants, and a diminution\r\nof the diarrhoea. A copious eruption is also regarded by many as a\r\nfavorable symptom. Cases in which constipation exists generally do\r\nwell. Nathan Smith never knew a patient to die whose bowels were\r\nconstipated throughout the attack.\r\n\r\nThe death-rate of typhoid fever is found to vary very considerably in\r\ndifferent years and in the different seasons of the year, as will be\r\nseen {317} from the two following tables. Statistics as to the\r\nmortality of the disease to be reliable must therefore be based upon a\r\nlarge number of cases extending over a series of years.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of cases admitted into the\r\nPennsylvania Hospital during each of the twenty years ending Dec. 31,\r\n1881, and the ratio of mortality among them:\r\n\r\nTABLE NO. 1.\r\n\r\n -------+------+------+------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n        |      |      |      |      |        |        |       |Percen-\r\n        |      |      |      |      |        |        |       |tage of\r\n        |      |      |      |      |        |        |       | deaths\r\n        |      |      |      |      |        |        |       |  after\r\n        |      |      |      |      |        |        |       |deduct-\r\n        |      |      |      |Number|        |        |       |   ing\r\n        |      |      |      |  of  |        |        |       |  cases\r\n        |      |      |      |deaths| Average|        |       |  fatal\r\n        |      |      |      |within|  stay  |        |       | within\r\n        |      |      |      |  48  |in cases|        |       |   48\r\n        |      |Number|Number| hours| ending | Average|       |  hours\r\n        |Number|  of  |  of  |  of  |   in   |  stay  |Percen-|   of\r\n        |  of  |recov-| dea- |admis-| recov- |in fatal|tage of| admis-\r\n  YEAR. |cases.|eries.| ths. | sion.|  ery.  | cases. |deaths.|  sion.\r\n -------+------+------+------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n  1862  |  89  |  68  |  21  |   7  | 54-1/3 |  8     |  23.6 |  17.7\r\n  1863  |  36  |  33  |   3  |   2  | 32-1/5 |  3-1/3 |   8.3 |   2.9\r\n  1864  |  43  |  35  |   8  |   1  | 38-1/2 |  8     |  18.6 |  16.3\r\n  1865  |  36  |  31  |   5  |   1  | 38-1/2 |  5-1/2 |  13.9 |  11.4\r\n  1866  |  23  |  17  |   6  |   0  | 45-2/3 |  9     |  26.0 |\r\n  1867  |  24  |  20  |   4  |   0  | 37-1/3 |  6-1/2 |  16.6 |\r\n  1868  |  27  |  23  |   4  |   0  | 44-3/4 | 10     |  14.8 |\r\n  1869  |  21  |  16  |   5  |   1  | 35-1/2 | 14     |  23.8 |  20.0\r\n  1870  |  24  |  19  |   5  |   1  | 47-1/2 | 11     |  20.8 |  17.4\r\n  1871  |  32  |  26  |   6  |   1  | 37-3/4 | 13-1/2 |  18.8 |  15.0\r\n  1872  |  21  |  16  |   5  |   3  | 37-1/2 |  4-1/2 |  23.8 |  11.1\r\n  1873  |  12  |   8  |   4  |   2  | 34     |  9     |  33.3 |  20.0\r\n  1874  |  16  |  12  |   4  |   0  | 54-1/2 |  9-3/4 |  25.0 |\r\n  1875  |  20  |  18  |   2  |   1  | 48     |  4-1/2 |  10.0 |   5.3\r\n  1876  |  30  |  21  |   9  |   2  | 45-1/2 | 11     |  30.0 |  25.0\r\n  1877  |  48  |  34  |  14  |   4  | 48-1/2 | 12-1/2 |  29.2 |  22.7\r\n  1878  |   8  |   5  |   3  |   0  | 49     |  5-2/3 |  37.5 |\r\n  1879  |  17  |  15  |   2  |   0  | 53-1/3 |  8     |  11.8 |\r\n  1880  |  40  |  35  |   5  |   2  | 47     | 10-1/2 |  12.5 |   8.0\r\n  1881  |  54  |  48  |   6  |   0  | 41-3/4 |  8     |  11.1 |\r\n -------+------+------+------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n Totals,| 621  | 500  | 121  |  28  | 43-1/2 |  8-3/4 |  19.5 |  15.7\r\n -------+------+------+------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nOut of the 621 cases admitted, 121 were fatal. This gives a death-rate\r\nof 19.5 per cent.; but if we deduct the 28 cases in which the patients\r\ndied within forty-eight hours of their admission, it falls to 15.68\r\nper cent., or about the same ratio as Murchison found to exist among\r\nthe cases treated at the London Fever Hospital. Other observers have\r\nobtained slightly different results. Thus, the mortality was 11.16 per\r\ncent. in 197 cases analyzed by Dr. Hale, and 13.5 per cent. in 303\r\ncases collected by Dr. James Jackson. Dr. Cayley[93] found the\r\ndeath-rate of the several hospitals in London to be 17.8 per cent.,\r\nand Geissler[94] that it was in all the German hospitals 12.8 per\r\ncent. in 1877, and 13.5 per cent. in 1878. Flint had 18 deaths in 73\r\ncases, or 24.4 per cent. According to Liebermeister, the ratio of\r\nmortality at the hospital at Basle during the twenty-two years from\r\n1843 to 1864, or before the introduction of a {318} systematic\r\nanti-pyretic treatment, was 27.3 per cent., and only 8.2 per cent.\r\nduring the six years immediately following its adoption. As the\r\nresults obtained at the Pennsylvania Hospital are apparently not so\r\nfavorable as those reported at some of the continental hospitals, it\r\nis only proper to state that a large proportion of the cases were\r\nsevere, that many of them were far advanced in the disease when\r\nadmitted, and that very few of the patients were under twenty-one\r\nyears of age. These are all circumstances which influence very\r\ndecidedly the prognosis in typhoid fever. In no other city are the\r\nlaboring classes able to surround themselves with so many comforts as\r\nin Philadelphia. This fact, fortunate as it is in the main, often\r\noperates to the disadvantage of the patient by enabling his family to\r\nindulge for a time the reluctance which it naturally feels to part\r\nwith a member when sick. In the case of the young this reluctance is\r\nso hard to overcome that children with acute affections are rarely\r\nbrought to hospitals for treatment. There were also special causes for\r\nthe large mortality in certain years. This was particularly the case\r\nin 1862, when a large number of soldiers fresh from the battlefields\r\nof Virginia, and suffering from the typho-malarial form of the\r\ndisease, were admitted into the hospital. Many of them were moribund\r\nupon admission, and others, exhausted by the fatigue incident to\r\ntransportation here and by previous hardships, soon succumbed to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Med. Times and Gaz._, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: _Schmidt's Jahrbuch_.]\r\n\r\nTable 2 gives the number of cases, with the number of deaths occurring\r\nin each season, at the Pennsylvania Hospital during the last twenty\r\nyears:\r\n\r\nTABLE NO. 2.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                           | Spring. | Summer. | Autumn. | Winter.\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Number of cases          |   89    |  259    |  182    |   91\r\n  Recoveries               |   73    |  191    |  163    |   73\r\n  Deaths                   |   16    |   68    |   19    |   18\r\n  Percentage of mortality  |   18.0  |   26.2  |   10.4  |   19.8\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this table that the highest death-rate occurred\r\nin the summer and the lowest in autumn, while there was only a slight\r\ndifference between the death-rate of spring and that of winter.\r\nMurchison's experience, based on a much larger number of cases, has\r\nled him to conclude that while the disease is a little less fatal in\r\nautumn, the difference in the mortality at different seasons is very\r\ninconsiderable. Chomel believed that the percentage of deaths was\r\nhighest in France during the winter months, and Bartlett held the same\r\nopinion as regards America. Epidemics of great severity have\r\nundoubtedly prevailed in winter, as the in Lowell, Mass., referred to\r\nby Bartlett, but there can be little doubt that the death-rate is\r\nhighest in this country during the warm months of the year. Dr.\r\nCleemann[95] found that the monthly average mortality in Philadelphia\r\nfor the ten years from 1866 to 1875 was highest in August, and next\r\nhighest in September, confessedly the two months of the year when the\r\nheat in this city is most exhausting. I feel very sure I have lost\r\npatients with typhoid fever in these months {319} and in July who\r\nwould probably have recovered if the weather had been cooler. With a\r\ntemperature often rising above 90° F. at midday, and sometimes for\r\nseveral days at a time never falling below 80°, all radiation of heat\r\nfrom the surface of the body is arrested, and death frequently occurs\r\nas the result of hyperpyrexia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Transactions of the College of Physicians of\r\nPhiladelphia_, 3d S., vols. ii. and iii.]\r\n\r\nThe stage of the disease at which efficient treatment is begun has a\r\nmanifest influence upon the result. This is strikingly shown by some\r\nobservations of Jackson: 90 cases were admitted into the Massachusetts\r\nGeneral Hospital during the first week--of these 7 died, or 1 in\r\n12.85; 139 cases were admitted in the second week--of these 16 died,\r\nor 1 in 8.68; 46 cases were admitted in the third week--of these 10\r\ndied, or 1 in 4.60; and 21 cases were admitted in the fourth week, and\r\nof these 5 died, or 1 in 4.20. Convalescence also occurred much\r\nearlier in those who were admitted early.\r\n\r\nMurchison found that in a large number of cases the death-rate varied\r\nat different ages as follows: Under ten years it was 11.36 per cent.;\r\nfrom ten to fourteen years it was 12.86 per cent.; from fifteen to\r\nnineteen years it was 15.48 per cent.; from twenty to twenty-nine\r\nyears it was 20.46 per cent.; from thirty to thirty-nine years it was\r\n25.90 per cent.; from forty to forty-nine years it was 25 per cent.;\r\nand above fifty years it was 34.94 per cent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Liebermeister, among the 1743 patients treated for\r\ntyphoid fever in the hospital at Basle from 1865 to 1870, inclusive,\r\nthere were 130 who were more than forty years old; of these 39, or 30\r\nper cent., died, while the mortality among the patients under forty\r\namounted only to 11.8 per cent. Among the cases of typhoid fever in\r\nindividuals over forty years of age collected by Uhle, more than half\r\nproved fatal. According to Friedrich,[96] there were, among 16,084\r\nchildren treated in the Children's Hospital at Dresden, 275 cases of\r\ntyphoid fever, of which 31, or not quite 11 per cent., proved fatal.\r\nAge, therefore, exercises a positive influence upon the mortality of\r\ntyphoid fever. Its influence is less decided in this disease than in\r\ntyphus, in which the death-rate does not reach 4 per cent. until after\r\nthe age of twenty, when it rapidly rises from 12.34 per cent. until it\r\nreaches 57.03 per cent. in patients above fifty years of age. The\r\ncomparatively slight mortality of typhoid fever among children is\r\nprobably due to the fact that the temperature is less often\r\ncontinuously high in them than in adults, and that while hyperpyrexia\r\nis frequently present, it is generally better borne and less likely to\r\nproduce paralysis of the heart. Liebermeister says that the only case\r\nwhich he has seen recover after the temperature had repeatedly risen\r\nto 107.5° F. was that of a girl fourteen years of age. It is also said\r\nthat the intestinal lesions are not so severe, and the liability to\r\ncomplications and sequelæ less marked, in children.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Quoted by Liebermeister.]\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever appears to be a slightly more fatal disease in women\r\nthan in men, for while in some local epidemics the percentage of\r\ndeaths is greater among the latter than among the former, the reverse\r\nis found to be the case when the records of a large hospital for a\r\nnumber of years are carefully examined. According to Murchison, the\r\nmortality at the London Fever Hospital was about 1 per cent. higher\r\namong the female than among the male patients, and about the same\r\ndifference in the death-rate {320} of the two sexes has been reported\r\nby continental physicians. A greater disparity even than this has been\r\nobserved by Liebermeister at the hospital at Basle, where the\r\ndeath-rate for women was 14.8 per cent., and only 12 per cent. for\r\nmen. Murchison says that this excess of mortality among the former\r\ncannot be accounted for by the influence of child-bearing upon the\r\ncourse of the fever, since it is much more decided between the ages of\r\nfive and fifteen than in the period of child-bearing.\r\n\r\nThe rich are not only as liable to contract typhoid fever as the poor,\r\nbut the disease is also quite as fatal among them. Murchison found\r\nfrom the statistics of the London Fever Hospital that the mortality is\r\nnot greater among the destitute than among the better class of\r\npatients, and expresses the opinion that in private practice enteric\r\nfever is probably more fatal among the upper classes than among the\r\nvery poor. Chomel and Forget seem to have reached a similar\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nAll authors agree that the prognosis is unfavorable in corpulent\r\npersons, not only on account of the diminished power of resistance to\r\ndisease generally which such persons exhibit, but also because the\r\nfebrile movement is often intense in them, and the degenerative\r\nchanges of the muscles and organs of the body which it induces are\r\ngenerally early developed and of high grade. Liebermeister goes so far\r\nas to say that even in the case of ill-nourished, anæmic, or chlorotic\r\nindividuals the chances for life are better than in the corpulent.\r\nMurchison has also expressed the opinion that a large, muscular\r\ndevelopment is likewise an unfavorable element in prognosis, having\r\nseen the strong and robust succumb to the disease oftener than the\r\nfeeble. The mortality from the disease appears to be greater in\r\ncertain families than in others. This has been ascribed by some\r\nwriters to peculiarities of constitution, but it may be due to other\r\ncauses, as, for instance, difference in the intensity of the poison.\r\nThe disease is also often very fatal among the intemperate, who\r\nusually bear the disease badly in consequence of the presence of\r\nvarious degenerations of one or more of the important organs of the\r\nbody caused by the excessive indulgence in alcoholic stimulants;\r\nparalysis of the heart being not an infrequent cause of death among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCertain epidemics have been exceedingly fatal, while in others the\r\npercentage of deaths has been very small. There can be no doubt that\r\nin most of these cases there has been a difference in the virulence of\r\nthe poison. Recent residence in an infected locality has been shown by\r\nMurchison and other writers to have a decided influence in increasing\r\nthe fatality of the disease. Second attacks are, on the other hand,\r\nusually mild. Some diversity of opinion exists among authors in regard\r\nto the effect that pregnancy has upon the course of the disease.\r\nMurchison believes that it is a far less formidable complication than\r\nis usually thought, while Liebermeister, on the contrary, holds a\r\ndirectly opposite opinion. He also regards the prognosis as\r\nunfavorable when the disease occurs in childbed or a short time\r\nafterward. Individuals with disease of the heart, emphysema, or\r\nbronchial catarrh who contract typhoid fever are said to be more\r\nliable to paralysis of the heart than others, hence the existence of\r\nthese diseases materially diminishes their chances of recovery.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Inasmuch as the spread and propagation of typhoid fever\r\nmay be prevented to a great extent, if not entirely, by the {321}\r\nemployment of judicious sanitary measures, it is proper, before\r\nentering upon the discussion of its curative treatment, to devote a\r\nfew words to the prophylaxis of the disease.\r\n\r\nWhether the physician accepts the theory so ably advocated by\r\nMurchison, that typhoid fever may arise from exposure to the products\r\nof the fermentation of healthy feces, or adopts the view now held by a\r\nlarge number of investigators, that the disease is never generated in\r\nthe absence of the specific germ, he will admit the great importance\r\nof an efficient system of sewerage, with a thorough flushing of the\r\nsewers at regular and frequent intervals, for disposing of the fecal\r\ndischarges of the population of all towns, no matter how\r\ninconsiderable in size. No less important is it that the drains of\r\nevery dwelling should be well constructed and kept in good order. They\r\nshould be trapped just before they empty into the sewer, and should be\r\nprovided with the means of thorough ventilation between the trap and\r\nthe walls of the house by a free communication with the outer air. The\r\nsoil-pipe should be carried up three or four feet above the top of the\r\nhouse, and every water-closet, bath-tub, stationary washstand, and\r\nsink should have its own separate trap, and none of them should be\r\nplaced in rooms unprovided with a window or with some other sufficient\r\nmeans of ventilation. Physicians should, as sanitarians, urge upon the\r\nauthorities of all cities and towns the importance of deriving their\r\nwater-supply from a source unpolluted by sewerage or by any other\r\nsubstances likely to be deleterious to health. They should also see\r\nthat when water is stored in a tank inside of a house the overflow\r\npipe does not communicate directly with the drain, since if this is\r\nallowed to occur the water may very soon become contaminated with\r\nsewer gas, and consequently unfit for internal use.\r\n\r\nIn the case of isolated country-houses and of small villages some\r\nother means of disposing of the fecal discharges of the inhabitants\r\nthan by sewers has to be found. In the great majority of instances no\r\nbetter way presents itself than by the ordinary cesspool. Care should,\r\nhowever, be taken that this is so constructed and situated that there\r\ncan be no filtration of its contents into wells from which water for\r\ndrinking is obtained.\r\n\r\nAs the alvine dejections of the sick are beyond question the medium by\r\nwhich typhoid fever is most frequently communicated to others, the\r\nimportance of thoroughly disinfecting them before they have acquired\r\nthe power of imparting the disease cannot well be overestimated.\r\nLiebermeister recommends that the bottom of the bed-pan should be\r\nstrewed, each time before being used, with a layer of sulphate of\r\niron, and that immediately after a passage crude muriatic acid should\r\nbe poured over the fecal mass, as much as one-third or one-half of the\r\nbulk of the latter being used. He also urges, whenever it is\r\npracticable, that the contents of the bed-pan should be emptied into\r\ntrenches dug anew every two days and filled up when discarded, care\r\nbeing of course taken that they are not located anywhere in the\r\nvicinity of wells. Murchison seems to prefer carbolic acid to other\r\nchemical agents as a means of preventing fecal fermentation. For this\r\npurpose the liquid carbolic acid may be diluted with water in the\r\nproportion of 1 to 40 to 1 to 20, or it may be mixed with sand or\r\nsawdust. I have myself employed as a disinfectant with success the\r\nsolution of the chlorides sold under the name of Platt's chlorides. As\r\nthe discharges must in cities, in the great majority of instances, be\r\nemptied into {322} water-closets, these should be freely flushed with\r\nwater after every time they are used; and it is well to impress upon\r\nthe attendant on the sick the importance of doing this. The bed-linen\r\nof the patient and his clothes, if they are soiled by his discharges,\r\nshould be removed as soon as possible, and subjected to a high degree\r\nof heat (248° F.) or soaked in a solution of the chlorides or of\r\ncarbolic acid for several hours before being washed. If these\r\nprecautions are observed, cases of typhoid fever may be treated in the\r\nwards of general hospitals without danger to the other patients.\r\n\r\nIn the doubt and obscurity which generally envelop the diagnosis of\r\nthe disease when the physician is first called upon to treat it, it is\r\nimpossible to lay down any positive rules for the management of\r\ntyphoid fever at its commencement. But even in those cases which begin\r\ninsidiously, if the patient is carefully examined enough of the early\r\nsymptoms of typhoid fever will be detected to put the physician on his\r\nguard. The thermometer will show the existence of fever, which has a\r\ntendency to increase at night. There will generally be found to be a\r\nlittle diarrhoea, or at least an increased susceptibility to the\r\naction of purgative medicines; perhaps a little tympany and tenderness\r\nin the right iliac fossa, and moreover a prostration which is out of\r\nall proportion to the other symptoms.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms, it is true, are not infrequent concomitants of many\r\ndiseases besides the one under consideration; but when their presence\r\ncannot be otherwise satisfactorily explained, especially if they have\r\ncontinued for several days, it is a safe rule in practice to regard\r\nthe case as one of typhoid fever, and to regulate the treatment\r\naccordingly. The patient must be put to bed at once, and not allowed\r\nto leave it on any pretext, not even to empty his bladder, after the\r\nfirst week. This is a rule which should be rigidly enforced in every\r\ncase, no matter how mild the symptoms may be. Its non-observance,\r\neither through the neglect of the physician or the ignorance or\r\nwilfulness of the patient, has been the cause of some disastrous\r\nresults; in illustration of which it is only necessary to refer to the\r\nfrequency with which perforation of the bowel occurs in walking cases\r\nof typhoid fever. Perfect quiet should be maintained in the sick room.\r\nVisitors should be excluded from it, and the attendants limited in\r\nnumber to those actually necessary to carry out the directions of the\r\nphysician. All unnecessary talking is to be avoided, and especially\r\nconversation carried on in a low tone of voice, which is always\r\nannoying to the sick.\r\n\r\nThere is only one condition under which I should be disposed to break\r\nthe rule of absolute quiet and rest laid down above, and that is when\r\ncalled upon to treat typhoid fever in the built-up portion of our\r\nlarge cities during the summer season. If the patient were still in\r\nthe first week of the disease, if his circumstances were sufficiently\r\naffluent to enable him to surround himself with every comfort, and if\r\nit did not involve a journey of more than a few hours, I should\r\nunhesitatingly send him to the sea-coast. I have so often seen cases\r\nprove fatal in summer in consequence of the great heat of the city--a\r\nheat, too, which is sometimes almost as great at night as in the\r\nday-time--that I should feel that I was giving him an additional\r\nchance of life by sending him where the heat was, at least\r\noccasionally, tempered by cool breezes from the ocean. During the late\r\nwar numbers of soldiers were frequently sent in the early stages of\r\n{323} typhoid fever from the camps in the South to their homes or\r\nhospitals in the North, and it is fair to say that they did at least\r\nas well as those who remained behind. But when the journey may be\r\naccomplished by means of Pullman cars and the other appliances of\r\nmodern travel the risk, and even discomfort, it involves to the\r\npatient is reduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\nAs the disease is usually one of long duration, the patient being\r\nrarely able to leave his bed under four weeks, and more frequently\r\nbeing obliged to keep it for a much longer time, the sick room should,\r\nwherever practicable, be large, airy, and provided with an open\r\nfireplace, which is a much more efficient means of securing thorough\r\nventilation than an open window, while it is not liable to the\r\nobjection sometimes applicable to the latter of causing a direct\r\ndraught upon the patient. It is well, however, for the physician to\r\nremember that the danger from this source is very much exaggerated by\r\nthe laity, and that patients in the febrile stage of typhoid fever do\r\nnot readily take cold. Still, the same end may generally be attained\r\nwithout the least risk to the patient by opening a window in an\r\nadjoining room. The temperature of the sick room should be steadily\r\nmaintained at between 65° and 68° F.\r\n\r\nThe careful regulation of the diet is also a point of great importance\r\nin the management of typhoid fever; for in this disease there are not\r\nmerely the high fever and other exhausting symptoms, speedily inducing\r\nexcessive prostration, loss of strength, and emaciation, common to\r\nmany fevers, but there is also the peculiar ulceration of the bowels,\r\nwhich gives rise to danger of its own and demands special\r\nconsideration in treatment. The food must therefore be not only\r\nnourishing, but also readily digestible, and not likely to create\r\nirritation in its passage through the intestines. All solid food\r\nshould therefore be excluded from the dietary of the patient as long\r\nas the fever lasts. Indeed, it is better to continue this prohibition\r\neven after the subsidence of the fever if rose-colored spots are still\r\nto be seen on the abdomen or elsewhere, or if there exists a tendency\r\nto diarrhoea or any other symptom indicating that the disease has not\r\nfully run its course. Having myself seen some rather disastrous\r\nresults from a too early return to solid food, I have been accustomed\r\nin my own practice to interdict its use until at least two weeks after\r\nthe beginning of convalescence. Jaccoud also lays much stress upon\r\nthis point, saying that the early administration of meat always gives\r\nrise to fever, to which, from its cause, he gives the name of febris\r\ncarnis. On the other hand, Flint[97] and Peabody have recently\r\nadvocated the giving of solid food immediately after the cessation of\r\nfever, in the belief that recovery is thereby promoted. Milk as an\r\narticle of diet is unquestionably to be preferred to all others in\r\ntyphoid fever. It is open, it is true, to the objection of\r\noccasionally forming tough curds in the stomach, but this may\r\ngenerally be prevented by giving the milk in small quantities at a\r\ntime, diluted with lime-water or barley-water or mixed with some\r\nfarinaceous substance. No positive general rule can be laid down as to\r\nthe amount to be given. This will be found to vary not only in\r\ndifferent cases, but also in the same case at different times. Indeed,\r\nin those cases which begin abruptly with symptoms of gastro-intestinal\r\nirritation, if it is forced upon the patient in large quantities it is\r\nnot only usually rejected, but also causes an aggravation of the\r\nsymptoms, while after {324} this irritation is allayed it will be\r\ndigested without difficulty. As a general rule, most adult patients\r\nwill be able to take from a quart and a half to two quarts of milk\r\ndaily, given in quantities of from four to six ounces every two or\r\nthree hours. It should be remembered, however, that if more is taken\r\nthan can be assimilated it will act as an irritant and increase the\r\ndiarrhoea. If, therefore, the stools contain undigested milk, the\r\nquantity should be diminished. Patients are occasionally met with, but\r\nnot in as great number as is often asserted, with whom milk habitually\r\ndisagrees. In these cases it must of course be replaced in whole or in\r\npart by some other article of food. Under these circumstances some one\r\nof the liquid preparations of beef may be given with advantage,\r\nalthough it may be objected to them also that they sometimes occasion\r\nan increase of diarrhoea. Beef-tea or beef-essence, made from the\r\nfresh meat whenever this can be obtained, is to be preferred to all\r\nothers; but when it cannot, that made from the preparations of\r\nJohnston or Brand is the best substitute. When the stomach is very\r\nirritable, Valentine's meat-juice, in consequence of the smaller bulk\r\nin which it is given, often answers an admirable purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _Medical News_, Mch. 29 and Apl. 5, 1884.]\r\n\r\nVarious farinaceous substances, such as farina, corn-starch, and\r\narrowroot, are also occasionally given in typhoid fever, and, although\r\nthe last named would seem to be indicated in cases in which diarrhoea\r\nis a prominent symptom, their tendency to cause flatulence is so great\r\nthat their use in the acute stage of the fever has not found favor\r\namong physicians generally. In convalescence, on the other hand, they\r\nare generally perfectly well borne.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the administration of alcoholic stimulants in typhoid\r\nfever may be conveniently considered in this connection. Some\r\ndifference of opinion exists in regard to the quantity in which they\r\nshould be given, and indeed in regard to the necessity for their use\r\nat all in many cases, as, for instance, in those of young persons\r\nwhose health and habits had been good previously to the attack. I have\r\nmyself treated several such cases without alcohol, and have not been\r\nable to perceive that their duration was longer and the result less\r\nfavorable than in cases in which it was given in the usual amount. It\r\nis, moreover, not necessary to prescribe it always, even in very\r\nsevere cases, at the beginning of an attack. When given at this time,\r\nit not infrequently does harm by increasing the fever. It should be\r\nreserved, therefore, until the action of the heart grows feeble and\r\nthe first sound becomes indistinct. It is not possible to lay down any\r\ngeneral rule as to the amount to be given, even in severe attacks.\r\nThis will vary in different cases, and to a certain extent will be\r\ndetermined by the effects it produces. If the pulse grows stronger and\r\nthe delirium diminishes under its use, it is doing good and should be\r\ncontinued; if, on the other hand, there is increase of delirium and\r\nrestlessness, the quantity should be diminished.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which only a gentle stimulus is required wine in the form\r\nof wine-whey will often be found to meet the indication fully.\r\nGenerally, however, it will be necessary to have recourse to whiskey\r\nor brandy. The choice between these may usually be left to the\r\npatient's fancy; brandy is, however, to be preferred in cases in which\r\ndiarrhoea is a prominent symptom. These stimulants should be given in\r\nsmall quantities frequently repeated. In many cases a dessertspoonful\r\nevery two or three hours, {325} either diluted with water or, when the\r\nstomach is irritable, with carbonic acid water or given in the form of\r\nmilk punch, will be sufficient. In others a tablespoonful every two\r\nhours, or even at shorter intervals, will be required, but it will\r\nrarely be necessary to exceed eight ounces a day for more than a few\r\ndays at a time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the physician will not often be called upon at the present\r\nday to encounter and combat the prejudice so common formerly against\r\nthe free administration of water in the febrile condition, he will\r\nfrequently find nurses and others not sufficiently alive to the\r\nimportance of supplying it when the patient, having fallen into the\r\ntyphoid state, ceases to ask for it. The high temperature which is\r\ngenerally present in this condition, and the rapid combustion of\r\ntissue which it causes, make a full supply of liquid an urgent\r\nnecessity which it is dangerous to disregard. Water is the best of all\r\ndiuretics, and it is important in this disease, as indeed it is in\r\nmany others, that the functions of the kidneys should be kept active,\r\nso that the products of the combustion of the tissues may be\r\neliminated with their secretion. Care, however, should of course be\r\ntaken, as pointed out by Da Costa,[98] that water is not given in such\r\nquantity that the desire for and capability of digesting food is\r\ndestroyed by it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Preface to Wilson's _Treatise on the Continued Fevers_.]\r\n\r\nIn the few cases which begin abruptly with symptoms simulating those\r\nof a so-called bilious attack the practitioner will usually content\r\nhimself with the administration of medicines calculated to allay the\r\nirritability of the stomach and bowels. For this purpose I have found\r\nthe bicarbonate of potassa in solution, to which lemon-juice is added\r\nat the moment it is taken, so as to produce an extemporaneous\r\neffervescing draught, often an admirable remedy. In other cases I have\r\nused with advantage small doses of calomel or blue mass, followed, if\r\nnecessary, by a gentle saline purge. When the symptoms have occurred\r\nsoon after a hearty meal, or when there is evidence that the stomach\r\nis overloaded, it will occasionally be necessary to have recourse to\r\nan emetic. Usually, the indications for treatment at the beginning of\r\nan attack are much less definite, and even in the class of cases just\r\nreferred to they become so after the subsidence of the\r\ngastro-intestinal symptoms. Indeed, the treatment in the larger number\r\nof cases must be purely symptomatic until the nature of the disease\r\nhas fully declared itself. The presence of fever will suggest the use\r\nof the neutral mixture, effervescing draught, or spirit of Mindererus,\r\ncombined, if there is decided tendency to evening exacerbations, with\r\nsulphate of quinia in full doses. If there is much diarrhoea, Hope's\r\ncamphor mixture or opium in some other form may be given; if delirium\r\nis a prominent symptom, ice or cloths wrung out of cold water should\r\nbe kept constantly applied to the head.\r\n\r\nBut even after all doubt in regard to the diagnosis has been dispelled\r\nand the existence of typhoid fever has been recognized, the treatment\r\nmost in favor with physicians is in large measure symptomatic in\r\ncharacter. It is true that various specific treatments, to which\r\nfuller reference will be made hereafter, have been lately proposed,\r\nbut the results obtained by them up to the present time where they\r\nhave been fairly tested are not so favorable as to induce the body of\r\nthe profession to adopt them to the exclusion of all other methods. It\r\nis certain that no remedy or plan of {326} treatment has yet been\r\ndiscovered which has the power of cutting the disease short, although\r\nthis power has been claimed at different times for several. Thus, at\r\none time quinia in very large doses was believed to possess it, at\r\nanother venesection, and at another cold baths. But experience has\r\nshown that these and other perturbating remedies often do harm, and\r\nthere is good reason to believe that the apparent good which has\r\nfollowed their use in a comparatively small number of instances may be\r\nbetter explained by supposing that an error of diagnosis has been made\r\nthan by attributing to them the power of arresting the progress of the\r\ndisease. Medicines are, however, by no means useless in the treatment\r\nof typhoid fever. There is no question that the disease is not only\r\ngenerally conducted to a favorable issue, but that its duration is\r\noften materially shortened, by their judicious use. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that the treatment must vary with the severity of the attack.\r\nIn a few cases it is scarcely necessary to interfere with the course\r\nof the disease by the administration of medicines. In others, on the\r\ncontrary, it is necessary to act promptly and energetically in order\r\nto save life.\r\n\r\nWhen called upon to treat typhoid fever, if the case is a mild one\r\nwith no bad symptoms, such as excessive diarrhoea, delirium, tremors,\r\nand the like, and especially if the temperature does not rise higher\r\nthan 102° F., I am accustomed, after giving minute directions as to\r\nthe diet and general care of the patient, to prescribe from two to\r\nthree grains of sulphate of quinia four times daily. No great power in\r\nreducing the temperature of the body can, of course, be claimed for\r\nthese doses, but experience has shown that the impression which they\r\nmake is useful, and they do not interfere with the administration of\r\nthe drug in larger quantities should this become necessary. Their\r\naction, too, is tonic, and, as they rarely produce cinchonism, the\r\nobjection often made to the use of larger doses does not apply to\r\nthem. I am also in the habit of adding to each dose of quinia from ten\r\nto fifteen drops of one of the mineral acids. These acids were\r\noriginally prescribed in typhoid fever under the impression that they\r\nneutralized the cause of the disease, which was supposed to be an\r\nalkaline poison. Although the results of recent research, which tend\r\nto show that the cause of the disease is an organized germ, give no\r\nsupport to this theory, they continue to be used by a large number of\r\nphysicians of experience. I do not know that any satisfactory\r\nexplanation of their action in typhoid fever has ever been given. They\r\nare certainly tonics, and are therefore indicated, if not in the\r\nbeginning of the disease, as soon as the strength begins to fail. If,\r\nas the disease progresses, the tongue becomes dry and fissured, and if\r\nthere is much tympany, it will be well to give, in addition to the\r\nquinia, ten drops of the oil of turpentine in mucilage every two\r\nhours. This was a favorite remedy of the late George B. Wood, the\r\ndistinguished professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, who attributed the improvement in the\r\nsymptoms which generally follows its use to a direct influence of this\r\nmedicine upon the ulcers in the intestines. Although inclined to\r\nbelieve that the correct explanation of this improvement is its\r\nstimulating action upon the circulation and secretions, I fully agree\r\nwith him in regard to its usefulness in many cases. Under its use I\r\nhave often seen the dry, fissured, and shrivelled tongue {327} grow\r\nmoist and throw off its coating much earlier than in all probability\r\nit would otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nNo other than this simple treatment is required in a large number of\r\ncases, but even in mild cases symptoms occasionally arise which render\r\nnecessary some modification of it. It will, however, be more\r\nconvenient to postpone the discussion of this part of the treatment of\r\ntyphoid fever until after the treatment of the more serious forms of\r\nthe disease has been considered.\r\n\r\nWhen typhoid fever assumes a severe type, the success of the physician\r\nin the management of the disease will depend largely upon the\r\nreadiness with which he detects indications for treatment and the\r\npromptness with which he meets them. Usually, one of the first\r\nsymptoms to demand attention is the high temperature. This is not only\r\nan early symptom in many bad cases, but may continue throughout the\r\nattack; or it may suddenly supervene in cases in which the fever has\r\npreviously been moderate in degree, and when excessive may be the\r\ndirect or indirect cause of death. The reduction of the temperature is\r\ntherefore an indication the importance of which cannot well be\r\noverestimated. Fortunately, there are several methods by which this\r\nend may be accomplished. It will, however, be necessary for our\r\npurpose to consider only two of them in detail: 1, the cold-water\r\ntreatment; 2, sulphate of quinia in full doses.\r\n\r\nThe cold-water treatment is not new, since it was practised in the\r\nform of cold effusion in the treatment of fevers as long ago as 1787\r\nby Currie of Liverpool, who may be said to have introduced it, and who\r\nasserted that it had the power not merely of moderating the symptoms\r\nof these diseases, but also, in many cases, of cutting them short. It\r\nenjoyed at first a high degree of popularity, which lasted for from\r\ntwenty to thirty years, but finally fell into disuse, probably in\r\nconsequence of the exaggerated character of the claims which were made\r\nfor it by its advocates. Although resorted to from time to time in\r\nvarious parts of the world, the merit of having brought it again into\r\nnotice seems to be due to Brand of Stettin, who published a work on\r\n_The Hydrotherapy of Typhoid Fever_ in 1861. Still more recently, the\r\nrecorded observations of Bartels, Jürgensen, Ziemssen, and\r\nLiebermeister in Germany, and of Wilson Fox and others in England,\r\nhave so far restored the treatment to professional favor that there\r\nare few physicians either in this country or abroad who do not\r\noccasionally have recourse to it.\r\n\r\nThe cold-water treatment may be applied in several different ways: 1,\r\nthe cold bath; 2, the graduated bath; 3, cold affusions; 4, the cold\r\npack; 5, cold sponging; 6, cold compresses; and 7, frictions with ice.\r\nThey all act in the same manner, and depend for their efficacy upon\r\ntheir power of abstracting heat from the body, and are useful just in\r\nproportion as they do this. There is no reason for believing that they\r\nhave the power to modify the conditions upon which the production of\r\nheat depends, but there is, on the other hand, no doubt that under\r\ntheir use distressing and dangerous symptoms, such as coma, stupor,\r\nsubsultus, and the like, are often much relieved. They probably act,\r\ntherefore, by diminishing the metamorphosis of the tissues, and the\r\nconsequent loading of the blood with excrementitious products which\r\nthe hyperpyrexia has a tendency to promote.\r\n\r\nThe cold bath is the most effective of all the methods of applying the\r\n{328} cold-water treatment. Liebermeister recommends that the bath for\r\nan adult should be at the temperature of 68° F., and its duration\r\nshould be about ten minutes; if, however, the patient shows signs of\r\ngreat weakness, it should not exceed seven. After the bath he should\r\nbe wrapped up in a dry sheet or light blanket and put back in bed. If\r\nthe pulse should then show signs of failing, or if there should be\r\nshivering or any other evidence of weakness, he should be given a\r\nglass of wine or brandy or a dose of some other diffusible stimulus,\r\nand bottles containing hot water should be applied to his feet. The\r\nprocess of cooling goes on for some time after the patient's removal\r\nfrom the bath, for while a thermometer placed in the axilla will show\r\nthat the external temperature is immediately affected by it, the same\r\ninstrument placed in the rectum will indicate a gradual fall, which\r\nwill continue in many cases for at least half an hour. Shortly after\r\nthis the temperature will be observed to rise, and in many cases it\r\nwill not be more than two hours before it has attained its former\r\nheight. Liebermeister therefore recommends that the thermometer should\r\nbe frequently used, and that the baths should be repeated as often as\r\nthe temperature rises to 103° F. or above it. He has himself given\r\nthem as often as every two hours, or as many as two hundred during an\r\nentire illness, but usually finds that not more than six or eight a\r\nday are required. It often requires some persuasion to overcome the\r\nrepugnance which most patients feel at first for these baths, and the\r\nshock of being suddenly immersed in cold water is agreeable to very\r\nfew. Later, this repugnance, he says, entirely disappears. Intestinal\r\nhemorrhage, perforation of the bowel, and great weakness of the\r\nheart's action are all contraindications to the use of the cold bath.\r\nThey are especially to be avoided, according to Liebermeister, when\r\nthe force of the circulation is so far reduced that the surface of the\r\nbody is cold while the interior is very hot. On the other hand, the\r\nadvocates of this plan of treatment contend that the existence of\r\npneumonia or of hypostatic congestion of the lungs is not a sufficient\r\nreason for abandoning it, the congestion often disappearing under its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe graduated bath possesses some advantages over the cold bath, as\r\nits use involves less of a shock to the system. It is therefore more\r\nsuitable than the latter for nervous and excitable patients, for\r\npersons of advanced age or of general feebleness of constitution, or\r\nfor very young children. In it the temperature of the water, which at\r\nthe time of the immersion of the patient should be at or above 95° F.,\r\nis cooled by the gradual addition of cold water until it is reduced to\r\n72°, or below this point. These baths, to produce the same effect as\r\nthe cold baths, must be of longer duration. They are contraindicated\r\nin the same conditions as the latter, but to a less degree.\r\n\r\nAlthough fully willing to admit the good effects of the cold bath in\r\nmany cases, having been, of course, myself a witness of them, I am\r\nindisposed to have recourse to it except in cases of hyperpyrexia of\r\nsuch intensity that death seems imminent and only to be averted by\r\nenergetic treatment, or in cases in which other antipyretic remedies\r\nhave failed to reduce the temperature; and for the following reasons:\r\n1. In the first place, it is generally possible to produce a decided\r\neffect by the other methods of applying the cold-water treatment, with\r\nmuch less discomfort to the patient. 2. In a private house it is not\r\nalways practicable to have {329} a bath brought to the bedside of the\r\npatient, and in a general hospital to do so often would occasion a\r\ngood deal of annoyance to the other patients in the same ward, and I\r\nhave seen ill result from carrying him some distance to the bathroom.\r\nBut even where the bath is brought directly to his bedside, it\r\ninvolves so much movement, and is sometimes the cause of so much\r\nexcitement, that its good effects are more than neutralized by its\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nCold affusions, while not nearly so efficacious in reducing the\r\ntemperature of the body as the cold bath, are open to many of the\r\nobjections which may be urged against the latter mode of treatment.\r\nThey are, therefore, rarely employed at the present time.\r\nLiebermeister, however, thinks that they may sometimes be resorted to\r\nwith good effect for their brisk stimulating effect on the psychical\r\nfunctions or the respiration.\r\n\r\nThe cold pack possesses the advantage over the cold bath and cold\r\naffusions of involving less movement on the part of the patient and of\r\nbeing less terrifying to children, and may therefore be resorted to in\r\ncases in which the latter method of applying the cold-water treatment\r\nis contraindicated, as, for instance, in persons of feeble\r\ncirculation. It is, however, inferior to either of them in its cooling\r\neffects, and must be longer applied to produce the same effect.\r\nLiebermeister estimates that a course of four consecutive packs, of\r\nfrom ten to twenty minutes' duration apiece, is about equivalent in\r\neffect to a cold bath of ten minutes.\r\n\r\nCold sponging is assigned a very low place among the methods of\r\nabstracting heat from the body by many writers. It has, however, often\r\nbeen in my hands of much service, and its easy application and the\r\ncomfort which patients derive from it are certainly strong\r\nrecommendations in its favor. I have employed it frequently in cases\r\nof intestinal hemorrhage, and even in cases of great debility, and\r\nhave never yet had any reason to repent my having done so. The\r\naddition of a little vinegar to the water has seemed to me to increase\r\nthe effect of the sponging.\r\n\r\nCold compresses, either in the form of cloths wet with cold water or\r\nbladders filled with ice, can only produce a local fall of\r\ntemperature, and therefore, except when applied to the head, can be of\r\nlittle service.\r\n\r\nFrictions with ice are a powerful means of depressing the temperature\r\nof the body, and may therefore be resorted to in cases of intense\r\nhyperpyrexia when for some reason the cold bath cannot be obtained,\r\nand when there are no contraindications to the latter.\r\n\r\nLiebermeister classes cold drinks, the internal administration of ice,\r\nand the injection of cold water among the means of cooling the body in\r\nfevers; but it is doubtful if any great reduction of temperature can\r\nbe brought about by any of these remedies in the quantities in which\r\nit would be safe to use them. The first two, and to a less extent the\r\nlast, meet a very important indication, that of supplying water to the\r\nsystem. Their free use, therefore, forms a very important part of the\r\ntreatment of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nLuton of Rheims[99] extols the Diæta hydrica in the treatment of\r\ntyphoid fever. The patient receives absolutely nothing else to drink\r\nbut water, which is given in large quantities, for from four to six\r\ndays. No nourishment is given until the beginning of the third week,\r\nand first of all milk. If fever returns, the water is given again.\r\nMedicines such as {330} quinia and eucalyptus are given in adynamic\r\nconditions, which Luton says are rare under this treatment. He\r\nbelieves that the increase of the typhoid germs is prevented by\r\nabsolute diet and abundant supply of water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _Journal de thérapie_, Oct., 1880.]\r\n\r\nQuinia to produce a decided antipyretic effect must be given in large\r\nquantities. Murchison says that a dose of from fifteen to twenty\r\ngrains causes within an hour or two a fall of the temperature, and, to\r\na less extent, of the pulse, which may last from twelve to eighteen\r\nhours, and that he has never known any other disagreeable symptoms\r\nresult from its use than noises in the ears, temporary acceleration\r\nand irregularity of the respiration, and occasional vomiting. This\r\nquantity will often, however, be found to be insufficient to produce a\r\nnotable reduction of the fever, and it is therefore necessary\r\noccasionally to increase it. Liebermeister usually gives to adults\r\nfrom twenty-two to forty-five grains of the sulphate or the muriate of\r\nquinia, and this dose must positively be taken within the space of\r\nhalf an hour, or, at the most, an hour, as it is useless, he says, to\r\nexpect the full benefit of this dose to appear if the dose is divided\r\nand its administration is extended over a longer time. He never\r\nrepeats it in less than twenty-four hours, and, as a rule, does not\r\ngive it again under two days. Jürgensen has exceeded the dose of\r\nforty-five grains without observing any bad effects from it. When\r\nthese large doses are taken the fall of the temperature usually begins\r\na few hours after the administration of the medicine, the minimum\r\nbeing reached in from six to twelve hours, and it is usually not until\r\nthe second day that the temperature attains its former height. It is\r\nfound in practice that the most decided results are obtained when the\r\nmedicine is given in the evening, so that the time of its fullest\r\nantipyretic effects will coincide with that of the morning remission.\r\nWhen these large doses produce vomiting, as they occasionally will,\r\nthe quinia must be given by the rectum or hypodermically.\r\n\r\nQuinia possesses the great advantage over the cold bath that it may be\r\ngiven in conditions in which it would be dangerous to resort to the\r\nlatter. The existence of great cardiac weakness, of perforation of the\r\nbowel, or of intestinal hemorrhage do not usually constitute\r\ncontraindications to its use. In my own practice I have not often\r\nfound it necessary to have recourse to much larger doses than those\r\nrecommended by Murchison, preferring to repeat them if necessary\r\nrather than to give a single dose of even half a drachm.\r\n\r\nIt will be well, in this connection, to allude briefly to a few other\r\nremedies which have been given for their antipyretic effect. One of\r\nthese is digitalis, which has been administered for this purpose in\r\nvery large doses. Thus, Liebermeister recommends that from eleven to\r\ntwenty-two grains should be given in the course of thirty-six hours. I\r\nhave never used this drug in these doses, and therefore cannot speak\r\nof its effects from personal knowledge of them. I have frequently had\r\nrecourse to it, however, in more moderate doses, and I think with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAnother is sodium salicylate. This remedy has been used largely in\r\nEngland and Germany, and to a less extent in this country. It has been\r\nclaimed for it that it has the power of destroying the germs of\r\ntyphoid fever, but Stricker[100] finds it difficult to accord it this\r\nproperty in the face {331} of the fact that he has had three cases of\r\ntyphoid fever under his observation which occurred in patients just\r\nrecovered from rheumatism, which had been treated by this drug. My own\r\nexperience with it in the treatment of this disease is small, but has\r\nbeen unsatisfactory. While it is undoubtedly an antipyretic, the pulse\r\nbecomes weak and the inspiration less strong under its use. The brain\r\nsymptoms do not diminish under its use. Indeed, it is said to produce\r\nnarcotism in some cases. Dr. Jahn[101] and Dr. Jh. Platzer[102] speak\r\nmore favorably of it, but admit that its administration is\r\noccasionally attended by the inconveniences above referred to. The\r\nverdict of the profession in regard to it, tersely expressed by one\r\nwho had given it a fair trial, appears to be that it is a remedy that\r\nbrings nothing but disappointment to the physician and disaster to the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Deutsche Milit.-arztl Zeitsch._, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Deutsches Arch. f. klin. Med._, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Bayr. Arztl. Intell. Bl._, 1877.]\r\n\r\nEucalyptus, in the form of the tincture, is also a favorite remedy\r\nwith many practitioners. Dr. Benj. Bell[103] is in the habit of giving\r\na teaspoonful every three or four hours in a wineglass of water, and\r\nasserts that it diminishes the tendency to diarrhoea and the duration\r\nof the illness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Edin. Med. Jour._, Aug., 1881.]\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of typhoid fever require slight modifications\r\nonly of the treatment laid down above. In the typho-malarial form,\r\nespecially in those cases in which the malarial element predominates,\r\nand in which there is a marked tendency to remission, the early\r\nadministration of quinia in full antiperiodic doses is urgently called\r\nfor. In some cases which he had the opportunity of observing in the\r\narmy, A. L. Cox[104] found great advantage from the use of arsenious\r\nacid in rather large doses. When the disease attacks elderly people,\r\nan early resort to alcoholic stimulants is usually necessary, in\r\nconsequence of the excessive prostration it induces in them. Henoch\r\nand Steffen[105] assert that cold baths are not so well borne in\r\nchildren as in adults. Their influence is transitory only, and their\r\nuse has sometimes been followed by fatal collapse. In the renal form\r\ndry, and in some cases cut, cups should be applied externally and\r\nsaline diuretics given internally.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Outlines of the Chief Camp Diseases of the United\r\nStates Armies_, by Joseph Janvier Woodward, M.D., Philada., 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: _Jahrb. f. Korhde_, 1880.]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS REQUIRING SPECIAL TREATMENT.--Vomiting, when it occurs early\r\nin the disease, is usually checked by the administration of an emetic\r\nand by the application of sinapisms to the epigastrium. The use of\r\nemetics is no longer advisable when it occurs after the first week. It\r\nis better then to trust to small doses of hydrocyanic or carbolic\r\nacid, aromatic spirit of ammonia, or bismuth. It will often be found\r\nthat lime-water and milk will remain upon the stomach when every other\r\narticle of food or medicine is rejected. In some severe cases which\r\nhave been under my care the symptom was permanently relieved by the\r\nfrequent administration of small quantities of brandy in iced\r\nsoda-water. When vomiting is a consequence of peritonitis it usually\r\nresists every form of treatment.\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea, if the number of the stools does not exceed two or three in\r\nthe course of twenty-four hours, does not need special treatment.\r\nWhen, however, it is more severe, prompt measures should be taken to\r\ncheck it. Under these circumstances laudanum injections have seemed to\r\nme to be {332} by far the best remedy. It is not necessary that these\r\ninjections should always contain a large amount of laudanum or that\r\nthey should be repeated frequently. In many cases twenty drops once a\r\nday will be found to be sufficient, and it is rarely necessary to\r\nexceed forty drops twice daily. Opium given by the mouth or in\r\nsuppository in equivalent quantity does not act with anything like the\r\nsame efficacy. If the laudanum injections fail to restrain the\r\ndiarrhoea, it will be well to have recourse, in combination with\r\nopium, to the subnitrate of bismuth or the acetate of lead. Nitrate of\r\nsilver was at one time much employed in the treatment of typhoid\r\nfever, especially by the late J. K. Mitchell of this city, but was\r\nafterward suffered to fall into neglect. Its use has been recently, to\r\na certain extent, revived in consequence of the recommendation of\r\nWilliam Pepper,[106] who claims for it the power of modifying the\r\ncourse of the disease. I have given it in a number of cases, but have\r\nnever been able to satisfy myself that it possessed this power. I have\r\ntherefore ceased to prescribe it except in the later stages of the\r\ndisease, when the symptoms indicate that the intestinal ulcers are in\r\nan atonic condition. Under these circumstances it has appeared to me\r\nto promote their cicatrization. It is important, however, to remember\r\nthat diarrhoea is occasionally caused and kept up by more food being\r\ngiven to the patient than he can assimilate, and it is therefore a\r\ngood rule to examine the stools from time to time to see whether they\r\ncontain curds of milk or other undigested food. If such is found to be\r\nthe case, the amount of nourishment should be diminished, and it will\r\nbe well also to prescribe pepsin either in powder or in solution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: _Philadelphia Medical Times_, Feb. 12, 1881.]\r\n\r\nTympanites also occasionally requires treatment, for in addition to\r\ninterference with the descent of the diaphragm and other discomfort it\r\nproduces, the distended condition of the bowels directly increases the\r\nrisk of perforation. It is usually sufficient to employ embrocations\r\nor stupes of equal parts of sweet oil and oil of turpentine, or of\r\ncamphor liniment. If the tympanites coexist with constipation,\r\nenemata, either with or without a small quantity of oil of turpentine,\r\nmay often be used with advantage. If it is extreme, an intestinal tube\r\nshould be introduced very carefully into the rectum and the gas drawn\r\noff. Charcoal has occasionally been administered in this condition\r\nwith a view of preventing decomposition of the intestinal contents.\r\nTympanites occasionally rapidly supervenes upon the occurrence of\r\nperforation, and must then, of course, be treated with due reference\r\nto the latter condition.\r\n\r\nIntestinal hemorrhage is a symptom which always demands prompt\r\nattention, no matter how slight it may seem to be, for it is to be\r\nremembered that not only is there a danger of its recurrence, but that\r\nthe quantity of blood which appears in the stools is by no means a\r\nreliable measure of that actually lost, as more blood frequently\r\nremains in the intestines than appears externally. In estimating its\r\nseverity, it is therefore proper to take into consideration the\r\ngravity of the other symptoms which attend it, such as the fall of\r\ntemperature, feebleness of the pulse. In many cases the enforcement of\r\nabsolute rest, with the administration of cold drink and a small\r\namount of opium to diminish peristaltic action, is all that is needed.\r\nIn cases in which the symptoms are graver it will be necessary to have\r\nrecourse to more energetic {333} measures. Under these circumstances\r\nthe hypodermic injection of from three to five grains of ergotin,\r\nrepeated if necessary, has seldom in my experience failed to check the\r\nhemorrhage. Dilute sulphuric acid, oil of turpentine, and acetate of\r\nlead have also proved themselves useful remedies in my hands. The\r\napplication of ice to the surface of the abdomen has also been said to\r\nbe attended with good results, but the objections to the use of this\r\nremedy in the condition of collapse, which is so apt to accompany\r\nprofuse intestinal hemorrhage, are so evident that it is unnecessary\r\nto discuss them here. Monsel's solution, tannic acid, and various\r\nother mineral and vegetable astringents have been recommended for\r\ntheir direct effect upon the bleeding surface, but, even admitting\r\nthat they can, when administered by the mouth, reach this unaltered or\r\nin a sufficient state of concentration to be active, it is evident\r\nthat they could only do so after the loss of valuable time.\r\n\r\nWhen perforation occurs, it is obvious that the indications for\r\ntreatment are to preclude the extravasation of the contents of the\r\nintestine into the cavity of the peritoneum, and to prevent the\r\nperitonitis which is a consequence of this accident from becoming\r\ngeneral. Both of these indications are met by the administration of\r\nopium, which diminishes, and, if pushed, arrests, the peristaltic\r\naction of the intestines. By means of it the bowels may be kept as\r\nfree from movement as if \"placed in splints.\" A grain of solid opium\r\nmay be given every hour until a decided effect is produced, or if it\r\nis found to disagree with the stomach an equivalent quantity may be\r\ngiven by the rectum, or it may be substituted by morphia administered\r\nby the mouth or hypodermically. With the same view, food is to be\r\nallowed in small quantities only at a time, and of a character capable\r\nof digestion by the stomach. A light poultice, or, if there is much\r\nevidence of inflammation, ice should be applied to the abdomen. It has\r\nbeen recommended also, in cases in which the peritonitis has become\r\ngeneral, to apply leeches to the abdomen, but few patients in this\r\ncondition will readily bear the loss of much blood. It is very\r\nimportant not to interfere with the constipation which results from\r\nthe above treatment, and which it is one of its objects to promote,\r\nuntil all inflammatory symptoms have been absent for at least a week,\r\nwhen a simple enema may be administered. Peritonitis resulting from\r\nother causes than perforation of the intestine does not require any\r\nmodification of the above treatment.\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain, when it occurs independently of inflammation,\r\nis best treated by the application to the abdomen of light poultices,\r\nto which two or three teaspoonfuls of laudanum may be added.\r\n\r\nConstipation is an occasional symptom, but it rarely calls for active\r\ninterference. When it is present so early in the course of the disease\r\nthat the diagnosis is still uncertain, and has continued for several\r\ndays, it is best to prescribe a small dose of castor oil; a\r\ndessertspoonful is generally sufficient. The late Dr. Gerhard was in\r\nthe habit of giving a tablespoonful of sweet oil in this condition.\r\nThe inordinate action which frequently follows the administration of\r\nthese mild purgatives will often dispel all uncertainty as to the\r\nnature of the disease we have to do with. When it occurs in a more\r\nadvanced stage of the disease it is best met by the administration of\r\nenemata, which may contain, if there is much tympanites present, a\r\nsmall quantity of oil of turpentine. Under all {334} circumstances it\r\nwill be well to remember the advice given by Baglivi two centuries\r\nago, to avoid the use of active cathartics in this disease.[107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: \"Fuge purgantia tanquam postem,\" _Opera Omnia\r\nMedico-Practica et Anatomica_, Georgii Baglivi, 1788.]\r\n\r\nThe headache which is sometimes a distressing symptom in the beginning\r\nof the disease is usually relieved by the application to the head of\r\ncloths constantly wet with ice-water or by that of a bladder filled\r\nwith ice and lard. If it is very severe and does not yield to these\r\nremedies, a few leeches applied to the temples often have a very happy\r\neffect in moderating the pain. Murchison recommends that the cold\r\naffusion should be administered by simply placing the patient's head\r\nover a basin at the edge of the bed and pouring water on it from a\r\nheight of two or three feet. He also says that warm fomentations are\r\nto be preferred to cold in aged and infirm persons of feeble\r\ncirculation. Sleeplessness will often disappear under the use of\r\nremedies presented for the relief of the headache and other nervous\r\nsymptoms. It is occasionally so persistent as to call for special\r\ntreatment. If it occur early in the disease, it will generally be\r\nsufficient to prescribe at bedtime ten grains each of potassium\r\nbromide and chloral, repeated once or twice during the night. Later in\r\nthe disease this combination ceases to produce any effect, besides\r\nwhich chloral cannot be administered with safety after the action of\r\nthe heart becomes feeble. It is therefore necessary to have recourse\r\nto opium in some form or other. There are, it is true, theoretical\r\nobjections to its use in typhoid fever, such as its interference with\r\ndigestion and its tendency to lock up the secretions; but these will\r\nhardly weigh in the balance against the fact that the patient will die\r\nof exhaustion if the insomnia is allowed to continue, and that under\r\ncertain circumstances opium is the only drug which will procure the\r\nneeded sleep. The form in which it is given is not a matter of much\r\nimportance. I prefer the deodorized tincture, twenty or thirty drops,\r\nrepeated if necessary in an hour or two, but I have seen good results\r\nfrom the solid opium and from the hypodermic injection of morphia.\r\nWhen the insomnia is attended by much tremor and muttering delirium,\r\ncamphor may be added to the opium, and given throughout the day as\r\nwell as in the evening. Violent delirium is sometimes also relieved by\r\nadministration of opium and alcoholic stimulants, and by the\r\napplication of cold to the head. It is also much lessened by the\r\ncold-water treatment. When the delirium is so violent that restraint\r\nis necessary, it is better that this should be mechanical than that it\r\nshould be left wholly in the hands of ignorant and untrained nurses. A\r\nfolded sheet passed over the chest of the patient and fastened to the\r\nsides of the bed is frequently all that is needed. Stupor requires\r\nvery much the same kind of treatment as that suitable for the other\r\nforms of nervous derangement. If it is extreme, counter-irritants\r\nshould be applied to the nape of the neck and cold to the head. The\r\nlate Dr. Wood was in the habit of shaving the hair and applying a\r\nblister to the scalp of a patient in this condition, and I have seen\r\ngood in more than one instance result from this treatment. The urine\r\nshould also be examined, and if the quantity be insufficient diuretics\r\nshould be given. If it contain albumen or blood, counter-irritants and\r\neven cut cups should be applied to the loins. It is also important, if\r\nthe patient be in this condition, that the physician should not rest\r\nsatisfied with the nurse's {335} assurance that the urine is passed\r\nfreely, but should from time to time examine the supra-pubic region\r\nhimself. It is not infrequently found under these circumstances that\r\nthere is really retention, and that the wetting of the bed upon which\r\nthe nurse has based her assurances is really the consequence of the\r\ndribbling of urine from an over-distended bladder. I have known of\r\nserious results, such as cystitis, paralysis of the bladder, having\r\nfollowed the neglect of this very simple precaution. Convulsions when\r\nthey occur are to be treated by the application of cold to the head\r\nand counter-irritants to other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis is rarely so severe as not to yield to the use of simple\r\nremedies, such as the application of ice to the forehead or back of\r\nthe neck, or of styptics locally. In a few cases, however, it is\r\nprofuse, and it will then be necessary to have recourse to hypodermic\r\ninjections of ergotin, as in the case of hemorrhage from the\r\nintestines, or to plug the nostrils.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF COMPLICATIONS.--Hypostatic congestion of the lungs, as it\r\nis usually the consequence of feeble action of the heart, is best\r\ntreated by frequently changing the position of the patient, and by\r\nremedies calculated to increase the power of the organ, such as\r\nalcoholic stimulants, ammonium carbonate, oil of turpentine, and\r\ndigitalis. Recent German authors, however, regard digitalis as a\r\ndangerous remedy when the heart has undergone the granular\r\ndegeneration peculiar to fevers. It had, therefore, better not be\r\ngiven if the congestion occurs late in the disease. I have myself\r\nalways found advantage from the application of turpentine stupes to\r\nthe chest, and occasionally from the application of dry cups.\r\nPneumonia when it occurs as a complication does not render necessary a\r\nmaterial modification of the above treatment. It may sometimes be\r\nwell, if it occur early in a robust subject, to take blood locally,\r\nbut it can rarely be justifiable to do so by venesection.\r\n\r\nBed-sores may generally be prevented by frequently changing the\r\nposition of the patient, by scrupulous attention to cleanliness, and\r\nby bathing prominent parts of his body with whiskey and alum. These\r\nparts should also be protected from pressure by the judicious\r\narrangement of pillows and cushions. When redness or abrasions appear\r\nthe part should be covered with soap plaster smoothly spread upon kid.\r\nThis application may be continued even after the formation of sloughs.\r\nAs soon, however, as these show a tendency to suppurate poultices\r\nshould be applied, and the resulting ulcer treated as if occurring\r\nunder other circumstances.\r\n\r\nThrombosis of the femoral vein is best treated by elevating the\r\naffected leg and enveloping it with flannel cloths saturated with hot\r\nvinegar and water. Thrombosis of other veins is to be treated on the\r\nsame general principles. When an artery becomes obliterated, whether\r\nfrom embolism or thrombosis, the part which it supplies should be\r\nsurrounded with cotton wool and every effort made to favor the\r\nestablishment of the collateral circulation. If sphacelus occurs, it\r\nshould be treated on general surgical principles.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF CONVALESCENCE.--The importance of a strict adherence to a\r\nliquid diet in the early part of the convalescence of typhoid fever\r\nhas already been alluded to. The ulcers in the intestines often remain\r\nunhealed for some time after the subsidence of the fever, and errors\r\nin diet may therefore readily cause recrudescences of fever, if not\r\ntrue relapses. {336} These recrudescences are sometimes produced by\r\nvery slight causes. I have seen them follow undue mental exercise or\r\nworry, or sitting up too early or too long. It is therefore important\r\nto guard our patients at this stage of the disease from undue fatigue\r\nor excitement of any kind. Medicines calculated to build up the\r\nstrength and to improve the nutrition are clearly indicated at this\r\ntime. If the diarrhoea should persist, nitrate or oxide of silver,\r\nsulphate of copper, and subnitrate of bismuth in appropriate doses,\r\ngiven with a little opium, will all be found to be useful remedies.\r\nWhen, on the contrary, constipation exists, it is still necessary to\r\navoid the use of drastic cathartics; indeed, even mild laxatives\r\nshould be given by the mouth only after enemata have failed to produce\r\na movement of the bowel.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC TREATMENT.--The search for a specific remedy in typhoid fever\r\nis not new. It is as old as the theory that the disease is generated\r\nby a specific cause. The hypothesis that this is an alkaline poison\r\nled many years ago to the use of the mineral acids, and it was only\r\nafter experience had shown that they were without power to cut the\r\ndisease short, or even to control many of its symptoms, that they\r\nceased in a measure to be prescribed. Calomel also, which was\r\noccasionally resorted to formerly for its antiphlogistic effects upon\r\nthe intestinal lesions, has been lately recommended in Germany in the\r\ntreatment of typhoid fever on account of its supposed antidotal\r\nproperties. Seven and a half grains of the drug, and in some cases a\r\nmuch larger dose, are given four times daily on alternate days as soon\r\nas the nature of the disease is fully recognized. It is claimed for\r\nthis treatment that when it is begun early the rate of mortality and\r\nthe duration of the disease are much less under it than under any\r\nother. Its advocates admit, however, that the latter is not always the\r\ncase--a variety in the action of the medicine which is attributed to a\r\ndifference in the way in which the poison of the disease has been\r\ntaken into the body. Salivation is rarely produced by the calomel. The\r\ndiarrhoea, which is at first increased by it, subsequently diminishes,\r\nand the administration of each dose is followed by a decided although\r\ntemporary reduction of temperature.\r\n\r\nA diminution in the rate of mortality is also said to have been\r\nobtained by the administration of iodine in typhoid fever, although\r\nthe results of its use are on the whole less favorable than those of\r\ncalomel. Liebermeister recommends that three or four drops of a\r\nsolution of one part of iodine, two parts of iodide of potassium, and\r\nten parts of water should be given every two hours in a glass of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+---------+--------+--------------\r\n                            |  Number | Number | Percentage of\r\n                            | treated.|  died. | mortality.\r\n  --------------------------+---------+--------+--------------\r\n  Non-specifically treated  |   377   |   69   |     18.3\r\n  Treated with calomel      |   223   |   26   |     11.7\r\n  Treated with iodine       |   239   |   35   |     14.6\r\n  --------------------------+---------+--------+--------------\r\n      Total                 |   839   |  130   |     15.5\r\n  --------------------------+---------+--------+--------------\r\n\r\nThe preceding table, which is taken from Liebermeister's article on\r\ntyphoid fever in _Ziemssen's Cyclopædia_, is based upon the results of\r\n{337} treatment in 839 cases, a part of which were treated with\r\niodine, a part with calomel, and a part with neither, the rest of the\r\ntreatment being exactly alike in all of them, and consisting in the\r\nemployment of a partial antipyretic method.\r\n\r\nJames C. Wilson[108] has recently used with great success in the\r\ntreatment of typhoid fever the following prescription, which was\r\noriginally suggested by Roberts Bartholow: Rx. Tinct. Iodinii fl.\r\ndrachm ij.; Acid. Carbolici liq. fl. drachm j.--M. Of this, one, two,\r\nor even three drops is given in a sherry-glassful of ice-water after\r\nfood every two or three hours during the day and night. In addition to\r\nthis prescription his patients were given a dose of calomel varying in\r\namount from seven and a half to ten grains, which was repeated on\r\nevery alternate night until three or four doses had been administered\r\nin the course of the first six or eight days. Of sixteen cases so\r\ntreated, none proved fatal, although eight of them were severe, the\r\ntemperature reaching or exceeding 104° F. Da Costa[109] has used\r\ncarbolic acid in this disease, and has found it useful in controlling\r\nthe diarrhoea and in lowering the temperature, but suggests the use of\r\nthymol in doses of from half a grain to one grain as a substitute, on\r\naccount of its greater acceptability to the stomach. C. G. Rothe[110]\r\nrecommends a mixture of carbolic acid, tincture of digitalis, tincture\r\nof aconite, brandy, and tincture of iodine. Its use causes a decided\r\nfall of temperature and diminution in the frequency of the pulse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: _Transactions of the College of Physicians of\r\nPhiladelphia_, 3d Series, vol. vi., Philadelphia, 1883, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: _Ibid._, p. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: _Deutsche Med. Wochenschr._, 1880.]\r\n\r\nMy own experience does not enable me to speak with positiveness of the\r\nvalue of this plan of treatment. Indeed, it has been used in so few\r\ncases, to the exclusion of all other remedies, that it is difficult to\r\ndecide how far the result attained in cases treated by them is due to\r\nthem, and how far to the other therapeutic means employed. With the\r\ntestimony of such competent observers as those above named it is only\r\nproper that the treatment by iodine and carbolic acid should have a\r\nfurther trial. More caution, it seems to me, is required in the use of\r\ncalomel. While it is probable that in a few cases the intestinal\r\nlesions may be favorably modified by the purgation which it induces,\r\nthe indiscriminate use of the drug is, I am sure, calculated to do\r\nmore harm than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{338}\r\n\r\nTYPHUS FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES H. HUTCHINSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Typhus fever is an acute contagious disease, usually\r\noccurring epidemically, lasting from ten to twenty days, and\r\ncharacterized, among other symptoms, by an abrupt commencement, great\r\nprostration, profound derangement of the nervous system, and a\r\npeculiar eruption which appears between the third and eighth days, and\r\nwhich, disappearing at first under pressure, soon becomes persistent,\r\nand in severe cases may be converted into and be associated with true\r\npetechiæ. When it proves fatal, it generally does so at or near the\r\nend of the second week. The lesions found after death are not specific\r\nin character, and consist mainly of a marked alteration of the blood,\r\ncongestions of internal organs, softening of the heart, and atrophy of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Petechial Typhus, Putrid or Malignant Fever, Camp, Jail,\r\nShip, or Hospital Fever, Spotted Fever, Irish Ague, Contagious Typhus,\r\nBrain Fever, Adynamic or Ataxic Fever, Ochlotic Fever, Catarrhal\r\nTyphus.\r\n\r\nThe term typhus was first applied by Sauvages in 1760, and afterward\r\nby Cullen, to certain forms of fever, characterized by marked\r\nprominence of the nervous symptoms, to distinguish them from another\r\ngroup of cases to which they gave the name synochus, and is derived\r\nfrom the Greek word [Greek: typhos], which literally means smoke, and\r\nwhich is employed in the treatise on internal affections attributed to\r\nHippocrates for a similar purpose. According to Murchison,[1]\r\nHippocrates used the word to define a \"confused state of the\r\nintellect, with a tendency to stupor.\" The appellation typhus,\r\ntherefore, as indicating a very prominent symptom of the disease about\r\nto be described, is perhaps the best that could be given to it. It has\r\nbeen generally adopted by the physicians in England and in this\r\ncountry to denote this disease, but on the Continent, and especially\r\nin Germany, it is applied also to typhoid fever, the two fevers being\r\nusually designated there as typhus petechialis and typhus abdominalis,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _A Treatise on the Continued Fevers of Great Britain_, by\r\nCharles Murchison, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S., etc., second edition, London,\r\n1873.]\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--As human want and misery and the evils which follow in the\r\ntrain of war have never been wholly absent from the world, and as\r\nthese are the conditions which are now known to be favorable to the\r\nspread, if not to the generation, of typhus fever, it is highly\r\nprobable that this disease was the cause of some of the epidemics to\r\nwhich allusion is made by the sacred and profane writers of antiquity.\r\nYet their descriptions are too vague to justify us in assuming that\r\nsuch was positively the {339} case. The records of the first fifteen\r\ncenturies of our own era are similarly wanting in details, for, with\r\nthe exception of a brief notice of an outbreak of the disease in the\r\nmonastery of La Cava, near Salerno, in the year 1083, by Corradi[2] it\r\nmay be said to have been practically undescribed before the year 1546,\r\nwhen Fracastorius[3] published his work, _De Contagionibus et Morbis\r\nContagiosis_. From the description which this distinguished physician\r\ngives there of the epidemics which prevailed in Verona in the years\r\n1505 and 1508, there can be no doubt that the disease he had the\r\nopportunity of observing was really typhus fever. Not only are the\r\nprincipal symptoms succinctly described, but its contagiousness and\r\ntendency to early prostration fully recognized. We learn also, from\r\nthe same work, that the disease, although previously unknown in Italy,\r\nwas one with which the physicians of Cyprus and the neighboring\r\nislands were perfectly familiar. According to the same authority, it\r\nagain made its appearance in 1528 in Italy, and from there extended to\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In _Chron. Cavense Annali_, p. 1, 101, quoted in\r\n_Handbuch der Historish-Geographischen Pathologie_, von Dr. August\r\nHirsch, Stuttgart, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last half of the sixteenth century epidemics of typhus\r\nfever would seem to have been of more frequent occurrence than before\r\nit, since many of the medical authors of this period not only refer to\r\nit very fully, but also give accurate descriptions of the disease.\r\nThere is also abundant evidence of the same kind that it frequently\r\nprevailed epidemically in almost every part of Europe during the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, following generally in the wake\r\nof famine and of war, and often attaining a high degree of virulence\r\nin besieged towns. The histories of many of these epidemics are\r\nexceedingly interesting, especially those of the so-called Black\r\nAssizes which occurred at different times in several of the towns of\r\nEngland, and which derived their name from the fact that the disease\r\nwas communicated from the prisoners on trial to the judges and other\r\npersons in attendance upon the court; but to give these in detail\r\nwould be beyond the scope of this article. Although many of the\r\nauthors of these two centuries boldly advocated copious venesection as\r\nthe only rational method of treating the disease, there was a not\r\ninconsiderable number who recognized its essentially typhoid nature,\r\nits tendency to early prostration, and the fact that patients\r\nsuffering from it bear bleeding badly, as fully as is done by\r\nphysicians of the present day. They were also unquestionably quite\r\naware of the circumstances under which typhus fever generally arises,\r\nfor in 1735, Browne Langrish[4] wrote that it originated from \"the\r\neffluvia of human live bodies,\" and that its principal cause was\r\novercrowding with deficient ventilation, as a result of which \"people\r\nwere made to inhale their own steams;\" and a similar opinion was\r\nexpressed a few years later by Sir John Pringle,[5] J. Carmichael\r\nSmyth,[6] and others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _The Modern Theory and Practice of Physics_, by Browne\r\nLangrish, p. 354, London, 1764.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Observations in Diseases of the Army_, London.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nEpidemics of typhus fever have frequently occurred in various parts of\r\nEurope during the present century, although they have, on the whole,\r\nshown a greater tendency than before to confine themselves to the\r\nplace in which they first appeared. The most severe of these began in\r\n1846, and after committing great ravages in Ireland extended to\r\nEngland, and {340} subsequently to the Continent. The disease proved\r\nmuch more fatal than the sword in the armies of Napoleon in the towns\r\nbesieged by him in the early part of this century, and was the cause\r\nof an immense loss of life in the Russian and French armies in the\r\nCrimea after the fall of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nIn our own country typhus fever has appeared several times during the\r\npresent century, but the outbreaks have rarely attained the magnitude\r\nof epidemics, such as are seen in Europe, and have usually been\r\ndistinctly traceable to importation from abroad. It was first met\r\nwith, according to Wood,[7] in New England in 1807 and in Philadelphia\r\nin 1812, continuing to lurk, this author says, in the lanes and alleys\r\nof that city until the winter of 1820-21, when, as a student of\r\nmedicine, he had an opportunity of studying it. Another outbreak of\r\nthe disease occurred in the same city in 1836, and is the subject of\r\nan admirable paper by the late Wm. S. Gerhard.[8] Since then epidemics\r\nof moderate severity have repeatedly occurred at different times in\r\nseveral of the American cities, and have been described, among others,\r\nby Flint, Da Costa,[9] and Loomis. A large number of cases of typhus\r\nfever (1723), with 572 deaths, were reported to the Surgeon-General's\r\noffice during the late Civil War, but doubt has been thrown upon the\r\ncorrectness of the diagnosis of many of these cases by Clymer[10] and\r\nWoodward,[11] and by other army surgeons, who, as the result of their\r\ninvestigations of this subject, have reached the conclusion that\r\ntyphus did not prevail as an epidemic, however limited, among our\r\nsoldiers at dépôts for returned prisoners of war. A like immunity from\r\nthis scourge may be assumed to have been enjoyed by the Confederate\r\nforces, since Joseph Jones,[12] one of the most eminent of their\r\nmedical officers, has stated positively that no case of true typhus\r\nfever came under his observation during the war in any army, in any\r\nfield hospital, general hospital, or military prison, and that the\r\nexperience of all of his associates whose opinions on this question he\r\nwas able to obtain, either personally or by letter, was the same. It\r\nis therefore most probable that the cases entered upon the sick\r\nreports of both armies as typhus fever were in almost every case, if\r\nnot in all, cases of typhoid fever occurring in scorbutic subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _A Treatise on the Practice of Medicine_, by George B.\r\nWood, M.D., etc., Philada., 1855.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, February\r\nand August, 1837.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Ibid._, January, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _The Science and Practice of Medicine_, by William\r\nAitken, M.D., Edin.; 3d Amer. ed., p. 462, Philadelphia, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Camp Diseases of the United States Armies_, by Joseph\r\nJanvier Woodward, M.D., Philadelphia, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _United States Sanitary Commission's Memoirs--Medical_,\r\np. 600, New York, 1867.]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing sketch of its history it is evident that typhus\r\nfever has prevailed from time to time in almost all the countries of\r\nEurope. Indeed, it is probable that no one of them has wholly escaped\r\nits ravages, while in others--as, for example, Ireland--it has been\r\nmore or less constantly present until within the last few years, when\r\nits visitations have been less frequent as well as less severe. Even\r\nin countries which are popularly supposed to enjoy an immunity from it\r\nthere is evidence of an incontrovertible character that it has\r\noccasionally occurred. Such an immunity has been claimed for France,\r\nbut in the works of Riverius,[13] {341} Ambrose Paré,[14] and others\r\nwill be found descriptions of the disease which leave no doubt upon\r\nthe mind of their entire familiarity with it; and Hirsch, in his work\r\non _Historico-Geographical Pathology_, is able to give references to\r\nseveral writers who describe outbreaks that have recently occurred\r\nthere. The disease has also been observed in Iceland. Typhus fever is\r\nof much less frequent occurrence in the other divisions of the eastern\r\nhemisphere than in Europe. According to Murchison, there are no\r\nauthentic records of its having been met in Africa, or, with the\r\nexception of India, in Asia, such as it is seen in England and\r\nIreland. There are, however, reports of its occurrence in Asia Minor,\r\nSyria, Persia, Egypt, Nubia, Tunis, and Algeria, which Hirsch,[15] on\r\nthe other hand, believes place the occasional presence of this disease\r\nin these countries beyond doubt. The same difference of opinion exists\r\nbetween these two distinguished observers in regard to the accounts\r\nwhich have been published of typhus fever occurring in Mexico, Central\r\nAmerica, and South America, the latter holding that they are entirely\r\nreliable, the former that the cases described in them were really\r\ncases of malarial or typhoid fever. The disease has never been met\r\nwith on the continent of Australia, in New Zealand, or in the valley\r\nof the Mississippi and the States bordering on the Pacific Ocean in\r\nour own country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _The Practice of Physick_, being chiefly a Translation\r\nof the Works of Lazarus Riverius, London, 1678.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Traité de la Peste, de la Petite Verolle et Rougeolle_,\r\npar Ambrose Paré, Paris, 1568.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nWhile Hirsch's researches go to show that the tropical zone has not\r\nbeen so wholly exempt from the visitation of typhus fever as some\r\nauthors have asserted, they establish the fact that it is of much less\r\nfrequent occurrence there than in the colder portions of the temperate\r\nzone, where the modes of life are certainly much more favorable to its\r\nextension. Natives of warm climates are as liable to be attacked by it\r\nas others upon coming to places where it is prevailing, and in the\r\nPhiladelphia epidemic of 1836, which Gerhard[16] has described,\r\nnegroes and mulattoes suffered from it more severely than the whites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The etiology of typhus fever will be best studied under the\r\nheads Predisposing and Exciting Causes.\r\n\r\nPREDISPOSING CAUSES.--It may be stated, generally, that whatever\r\nimpairs the health or reduces the strength of an individual, even\r\ntemporarily, or acts depressingly on his nervous system, predisposes\r\nhim to typhus fever. But there are among the predisposing causes some\r\nwhich exert a more special influence on its production than others.\r\nAmong the more powerful of these is the overcrowding of human beings,\r\nwith deficient ventilation. Indeed, there are some authors who\r\nconsider that this has been in many cases alone sufficient to occasion\r\nthe disease; and although this opinion, as it involves the admission\r\nthat it may be generated de novo, is contested by others, there is\r\ngreat unanimity among authors in attaching great importance to it. Of\r\nthe patients admitted into the London Fever Hospital with typhus\r\nfever, a large proportion came from the more crowded districts of the\r\ncity. The disease has always been most prevalent in the poorer\r\nquarters of Glasgow, Dublin, and Edinburgh, and when epidemic in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1836 it was confined to a portion of the town which\r\nhas always been noted for the squalor and misery of its inhabitants.\r\nAmong those admitted during that year to the Philadelphia Hospital\r\nwere seven negroes, said by Gerhard to {342} be \"the entire population\r\nof a cellar.\" It is probably largely due to the fact that the better\r\nsocial condition of the poor in this country prevents the degree of\r\ncrowding which often exists in European cities that the disease is\r\ncomparatively rare here. The effect of overcrowding is of course much\r\nincreased by want of cleanliness, either of the person or of the\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nPoverty, not merely from its own depressing influences, but also from\r\nthe fact that it leads to overcrowding, is a powerful predisposing\r\ncause of typhus fever. Insufficiency of food, which is one of its many\r\nconsequences, by impairing his nutrition and thus diminishing his\r\nvital resistance, renders the individual more susceptible to the\r\naction of the specific cause. Gerhard says that of the patients seen\r\nby him in 1836 a very small proportion came from the better class of\r\nmechanics, and Tweedie[17] and Sir William Jenner[18] state that it is\r\nrare to meet with instances of the disease, except in the case of\r\nmedical practitioners and students, among those in comfortable\r\ncircumstances. Bateman[19] goes so far as to assert that \"deficiency\r\nof nutriment is the principal source of epidemic fever;\" and there is\r\ncertainly a remarkable coincidence in time between outbreaks of this\r\nfever and seasons of want and distress. But, as Murchison has shown,\r\ndestitution is not essential to the production of typhus, for the\r\nDundee epidemic of 1865 was due to overcrowding of the town, brought\r\nabout by the inhabitants of the surrounding country flocking into it\r\nin consequence of labor being unusually abundant and wages good.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Lectures on the Distinctive Character, Pathology, and\r\nTreatment of Continued Fevers_, by Alexander Tweedie, M.D., F.R.S.,\r\nLondon, 1842; and _Clinical Reports on Fever_, by same author, London,\r\n1830.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _On the Identity or Non-Identity of Typhoid and Typhus\r\nFevers_, by William Jenner, M.D., London, 1880; also _Lancet_,\r\nNovember 15, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19:  _A Succinct Account of Typhus or Contagious Fever of\r\nthis Country_, by Thomas Bateman, M.D., F.R.S., London, 1820.]\r\n\r\nSimilar in its action to the above cause is intemperance. Not only is\r\nthe habitual drunkard more likely to suffer from typhus fever than the\r\ntemperate man, but a single debauch has been followed by an attack in\r\nindividuals who had previously resisted the contagion. On the other\r\nhand, the most rigid temperance will not afford in all cases a\r\ncomplete immunity from its effects. The debility left by an illness is\r\nalso a condition favoring the occurrence of an attack of the disease\r\nin those who are exposed to its exciting cause. Fatigue of all kinds\r\nrenders the body less able to resist the causes of disease, and typhus\r\nfever is not an exception to the general rule. Overworked nurses are\r\nspecially liable to contract it. The depressing emotions also favor\r\nits occurrence. It has been observed during epidemics that those who\r\nexhibit an excessive fear of the contagion are much more likely to\r\nsuffer from it than the cheerful and courageous.\r\n\r\nNo age enjoys an immunity from the disease. In fact, it is probable\r\nthat all ages are equally liable to it. Buchanan[20] has seen it at\r\nthe London Fever Hospital in an infant a fortnight old and in a man of\r\neighty, and attributes the prevailing opinion that children rarely\r\nsuffer from it to the fact that they are not often taken to hospitals,\r\nbut are retained in their own homes for treatment. Gerhard[21] says\r\nthat no children in the asylum attached to the Philadelphia Hospital\r\nwere {343} attacked with the disease during the prevalence of the\r\nepidemic there, but the distance of the asylum from the wards in which\r\nthe cases were treated was probably the reason of their escaping. In\r\nthe few cases which have come under my own observation the patients\r\nwere young men, varying in age from twenty-five to thirty-five. The\r\nsexes also suffer from it equally. In some epidemics there may be a\r\npreponderance of one sex over the other, but in others the reverse has\r\nbeen the case.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _A System of Medicine_, edited by J. Russell Reynolds,\r\nM.D., F.R.C.P., etc., vol. i., article \"Typhus Fever,\" London, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nOccupation, except so far as it brings the individual into immediate\r\ncontact with the sick, as in the case of physicians, nurses, and\r\nclergymen, does not predispose to the disease. There would seem also\r\nto be no difference in the susceptibility of the different races to\r\nthe contagion. Acclimatization affords no protection from the disease,\r\nas it does in the case of typhoid fever, and change of the habits of\r\nlife does not appear to exercise any influence upon the liability to\r\nit. On the other hand, the susceptibility of different individuals,\r\nand of the same individual at different times, varies considerably.\r\nThus, while in many persons a single exposure to the contagion is\r\nfollowed by an attack, in the case of an engineer mentioned by\r\nMurchison it did not occur until after fifteen years of continuous\r\nservice at the London Fever Hospital. A person who has once suffered\r\nfrom typhus fever is not likely to contract it again, but this\r\nprotection is not complete, as there are a few well-attested instances\r\nof a second attack on record.\r\n\r\nThe disease prevails most frequently during the winter and early\r\nspring, principally because the cold weather of these seasons leads to\r\nthe closing of windows and all other avenues of ventilation, thus\r\nintensifying its exciting cause. Still, some epidemics of great\r\nseverity have occurred in the warmer months of the year, as, for\r\ninstance, the one described by Gerhard. It is also doubtful if there\r\nis any relation between variations in temperature and the amount of\r\nmoisture in the air and the prevalence of epidemics of typhus fever,\r\nalthough Hirsch regards a low and damp situation as powerfully\r\npredisposing to the endemic and epidemic prevalence of the disease. It\r\nis usually met with in towns on the sea-coast or on navigable rivers,\r\nbut it has also been observed frequently in country districts, and\r\neven in regions at a considerable elevation above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nEXCITING CAUSE.--The principal if not the only exciting cause of\r\ntyphus fever is a specific contagion developed in the bodies of the\r\ninfected and transmitted from them to the healthy by actual contact,\r\nby fomites, or through the atmosphere. The nature of this contagion is\r\nunknown. A careful study of its peculiarities seems to justify the\r\nopinion that it depends upon the presence of a minute organism in the\r\nemanations given off by the sick, which is capable of indefinitely\r\nmultiplying itself in the human body. But this is only an hypothesis,\r\nwhich rests principally upon the analogy between typhus and some other\r\ndiseases, as, for instance, relapsing fever and diphtheria, in which\r\nsuch a growth is thought to have been discovered, and upon the fact\r\nthat the contagious principle whatever it may be, is destroyed by a\r\ntemperature over 204° F.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in favor of the contagiousness of typhus fever is\r\nconclusive, and may be briefly stated as follows: When it breaks out\r\nin a community the disease not only attacks those persons who have\r\nbeen subjected to the same influence as the sick--as, for instance,\r\nmembers of {344} their own families, occupants of the same house,\r\netc.--but also those who have come from healthy localities to visit\r\nthem. In fever hospitals it is rare for any member of the household\r\nwho has not already had the fever to escape an attack, and the\r\nprobability of his suffering is in direct proportion to the intimacy\r\nof his relations with the patients. Thus, the nurses are far more\r\nlikely to be attacked than servants whose duties do not take them into\r\nthe wards, except those employed in the laundry, who are so often\r\naffected by it that Murchison says it is difficult to find women who\r\nare willing to take the position. The spread of the disease may often\r\nbe promptly arrested by the complete isolation of the first few cases,\r\nwhile free intercourse between the sick and the well is invariably\r\nfollowed by its extension, not only in the locality in which it first\r\nappeared, but to other localities. But the strongest argument in favor\r\nof its contagiousness is found in the fact that patients taken into a\r\npreviously healthy place have frequently become the starting-point of\r\nan epidemic. In this way the disease has often been introduced by\r\nIrish immigrants into the cities on our seaboard, and even into some\r\nof our interior towns.\r\n\r\nActual contact is not necessary for the communication of typhus fever\r\nfrom the sick to the well. The contagion may be transmitted through\r\nthe atmosphere. How far it will be transmitted in this way will depend\r\nupon many circumstances. In a spacious and well-ventilated ward it is\r\nprobable that the presence of one or two patients with this disease\r\ndoes not seriously endanger the safety of the other patients, and that\r\nthe only persons who run much risk of contracting it are the\r\nphysicians and nurses, who are often compelled in the performance of\r\ntheir duties to inhale the emanations from the bodies of the sick. At\r\nthe Pennsylvania Hospital, where cases of this disease are\r\noccasionally admitted, it has been usual to isolate them by placing\r\nthem in a room a few feet distant only from the dining-room of the\r\nmen's medical ward and separated from the ward by a short corridor.\r\nThe steward of the hospital informs me that during his connection with\r\nit, which extends over a period of more than sixty years, he has never\r\nknown the disease to extend to other persons, except on two occasions.\r\nOne of these was during the epidemic described by Da Costa, when an\r\nunusual number of cases was received, and when one resident physician\r\nand two nurses contracted the disease. On the other occasion, which\r\nhappened during my own term of service in the spring of 1881, a young\r\nDanish sailor appeared to have taken the disease from two British\r\nseamen. As it was ascertained positively that he had not entered the\r\nroom in which these two seamen were isolated, and as his bed in the\r\nward was one of the farthest removed from the room, and he had not\r\ntherefore been more or as much exposed to the contagion as the other\r\npatients, it was difficult to understand why he alone of all of them\r\nshould have suffered from it. The explanation was, however, found in\r\nthe fact that he had been taken over to the women's ward to act as\r\ninterpreter for a countrywoman who was not known at the time to be\r\nsuffering from typhus fever, and that he had remained there some time\r\nin conversation with her. Murchison and Buchanan both assert also that\r\ntyphus fever has never extended from the London Fever Hospital to the\r\ninmates of adjacent houses, even when it was itself one of a row of\r\nhouses. If, on the other hand, several patients with typhus fever are\r\nplaced in a crowded and ill-ventilated ward, the contagion will then\r\nbe found to have {345} acquired so much more virulence that few of the\r\nother patients will escape its effects.\r\n\r\nThere is also no question that typhus fever may be communicated by\r\nfomites. Numerous instances are on record in which the disease has\r\nbeen communicated by the wearing apparel and bed-clothes of patients,\r\nand we have already called attention to the frequency with which\r\nlaundry-women in fever hospitals are attacked by it. The clothes of\r\npersons who are themselves free from the disease, but who have been in\r\nclose attendance upon the sick for some time, are often also the\r\nmedium of communication. Indeed, Murchison goes so far as to say that\r\nmen who have not changed their clothes and \"who have been living in\r\nclose, ill-ventilated apartments and on short allowance, may at length\r\nhave their garments so impregnated with the poison of typhus as to\r\ncommunicate it to others without being themselves the subjects of it,\"\r\neven if they have not been brought in contact with fever patients. The\r\ndisease was communicated in this way, he thinks, in the famous Black\r\nAssize in 1750 by several prisoners to the court that tried them,\r\nalthough they were themselves free from it. On the other hand, with\r\nproper precautions there is little danger of the disease being\r\nconveyed by physicians to their own families or to other patients.\r\n\r\nSome difference of opinion exists as to the stage at which typhus is\r\nmost contagious. Many authors believe that it is more infectious\r\nduring convalescence than at any other time, and base this opinion\r\nupon the fact that the removal of fever patients to the convalescent\r\nward is very often followed by the occurrence of the disease among its\r\nother occupants; but this is probably due, as Murchison suggests, to\r\nthe patients being allowed at this time to wear their own clothing,\r\nwhich has not been thoroughly disinfected. It is much more likely that\r\nthe disease is more contagious during the stage when the febrile\r\nsymptoms are most marked than during either the stage of convalescence\r\nor that of invasion. It would appear also, from the observations of\r\nDr. Gerhard and others, that dead bodies do not readily communicate\r\nthe contagion or that the contagious principle is easily counteracted\r\nafter death. Still, there are several well-authenticated cases on\r\nrecord in which individuals have unquestionably contracted the disease\r\nfrom dissecting the bodies of patients dead from this cause.\r\n\r\nA question of great interest naturally arises here, as to whether or\r\nnot typhus fever ever occurs except as the consequence of exposure to\r\na previous case of the disease. Is it, in other words, ever generated\r\nde novo? Authorities are divided upon this point, many contending that\r\nan independent origin is impossible, and others that it may\r\noccasionally arise in this way. Among the latter is Murchison, who\r\nadduces in support of the position he takes several instances in which\r\npoverty, with overcrowding and deficient ventilation, appears to have\r\nbeen the only cause of extensive outbreaks of the disease, as in the\r\ncase of the Black Assize already alluded to. These cases the opposite\r\nparty explain by assuming that the germs of the disease are capable of\r\nlying dormant for a long time until roused into activity by favoring\r\ncircumstances. If the disease is caused, as we have shown there is\r\ngood reason to believe it is, by the presence of a minute organism,\r\nthis view does not seem to be untenable. Pasteur has demonstrated that\r\nthe germs of the splenic fever of some of the lower {346} animals may\r\nbe deprived of their virulence by cultivation in appropriate liquids.\r\nIf their virulence is diminished under certain circumstances, the\r\nassumption does not seem unwarrantable that under others it may be\r\nincreased, and if we may draw this conclusion in regard to one form of\r\nmicroscopic growth, we may do the same for others; and the hypothesis\r\nis therefore not an unreasonable one that the typhus germ needs the\r\natmosphere engendered by overcrowding for it to acquire the power to\r\nproduce the disease.\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF INCUBATION.--The period of incubation of typhus fever\r\nappears to vary considerably in length, but is usually about twelve\r\ndays. In some cases the interval between exposure to the contagion and\r\nthe occurrence of the first symptoms of the disease is asserted to\r\nhave been considerably longer, and in one instance as long as\r\nthirty-one days; but it is probable that there has been in most, if\r\nnot in all, of these cases a second exposure which has been\r\noverlooked. On the other hand, it is said to have followed at once\r\nupon exposure, as in cases reported by Gerhard, in one of which a\r\nnurse inhaled the breath of a patient whom he was shaving, and in an\r\nhour afterward was taken with cephalalgia and ringing in the ears,\r\nwhich were immediately succeeded by the other symptoms of typhus. In\r\nthis and other similar cases which are on record it is difficult to\r\nexclude the possibility of a previous infection. In a case, however,\r\nreported by Murchison there would seem to be no reason to suspect that\r\nany such previous infection could have taken place, as the patient,\r\nthe matron of an orphan asylum where there was no typhus, was taken\r\nill immediately after opening a bundle of clothes which a child had\r\nbrought with her from a fever hospital, and which had not been\r\nthoroughly disinfected.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--It will facilitate the study of typhus fever to give,\r\nin the first place, as most of the systematic writers on fever have\r\ndone, a brief clinical sketch of the disease as it ordinarily occurs,\r\nand then afterward to consider its leading symptoms in greater detail.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION.--An attack of typhus fever is sometimes preceded\r\nfor a few days by prodromata, such as a feeling of malaise,\r\nindisposition to exertion, pain in the head and limbs, anorexia, and\r\nvertigo; but it oftener begins abruptly with a slight chill, or more\r\nrarely with a decided rigor. This is followed in a short time by\r\nheadache, by a marked rise of temperature, and by an increased\r\nfrequency of pulse and respiration. Nausea is also occasionally\r\npresent, and less frequently vomiting. The tongue is at first moist\r\nand covered with a thin whitish fur, but soon becomes dryish, and its\r\ncoating is apt to assume a brownish appearance in a day or two. With\r\nthese symptoms there are loss of appetite, great thirst, constipation,\r\na dull, heavy expression of countenance, a dark, dusky hue of the\r\nface, and injection of the conjunctivæ. Mental confusion is early\r\nobserved, so that, although the patient may be able to answer\r\nquestions correctly when thoroughly roused, it is readily seen that\r\nhis mind is working with difficulty. The sleep is very often disturbed\r\nby dreams, so that he awakes from it unrefreshed. Prostration and loss\r\nof muscular power are so decided from the very beginning of the\r\ndisease that the patient is obliged usually to take to his bed at\r\nonce, and it is much rarer to meet with walking cases of the disease\r\nthan in typhoid fever. The urine is dense, scanty, and high-colored.\r\n\r\n{347} Usually, about the fourth day of the disease the characteristic\r\neruption of typhus fever makes its appearance. It consists of numerous\r\nspots of irregular form with ill-defined margins and of a dark red or\r\npurplish color, occurring singly or in groups, and varying in size\r\nfrom that of a pin's point to two or three lines in diameter. They\r\ndisappear at first under pressure, but in twenty-four hours become\r\npersistent, and in severe cases may be converted later into petechiæ.\r\nBesides this eruption there is another which consists of a faint,\r\nirregular dusky red, subcuticular mottling. The two eruptions together\r\nconstitute the mulberry rash of Jenner, and have been variously\r\ndescribed by different authors under the name of measly or\r\nmorbilliform rash.\r\n\r\nAs the disease advances the prostration becomes greater and the pulse\r\ngrows weaker. The tongue becomes dry and brown and trembles when\r\nprotruded. Later, it is so dry and contracted that it can scarcely be\r\nput out of the mouth. Sordes collect about the teeth and lips, and the\r\nsurface exhales a peculiar odor. The headache grows more severe or\r\ngives place to delirium, which may at first be active and violent, and\r\nthen pass into the low and muttering form, or the delirium may be of\r\nthe latter variety from the start. The sleeplessness of the early\r\nstages may continue, and the condition known as coma vigil not\r\ninfrequently supervenes. The delirium is usually followed by stupor,\r\nwhich is more or less profound in accordance with the severity of the\r\ncase, and which is accompanied by all the symptoms which characterize\r\nthe so-called typhoid state, such as subsultus tendinum, picking at\r\nthe bed-clothes, slipping down in bed, retention or incontinence of\r\nurine, and sloughing of the parts exposed to pressure. In this\r\ncondition the temperature, although usually still considerably above\r\nnormal, is lower than during the first week of the disease.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the issue remains in doubt, and may continue uncertain for\r\nseveral days before any improvement in the symptoms can be observed,\r\nor, the stupor passing into coma, the case may speedily terminate in\r\ndeath. When death is the result, it usually takes place about the\r\nclose of the second week or a little later, but it may occur earlier\r\nin consequence of the violence of the fever, or, when due to a\r\ncomplication, may be postponed until after the end of the third week.\r\nFortunately, however, recovery is the rule in this disease. The\r\nbeginning of convalescence is often as abrupt as that of the attack\r\nitself. The temperature will often be found to have fallen to the\r\nnormal or below the normal, the pulse and respiration to have returned\r\nto a healthy condition, and all confusion of the intellect to have\r\ndisappeared in the course of a few hours. Occasionally, however, its\r\napproach is more gradual, and a slight fall in temperature and a\r\ncorresponding improvement in the other symptoms may be observed before\r\nit actually occurs. Diarrhoea, an excessive secretion of urine, with a\r\ntendency to the deposition of urates, and moderate sweating, often\r\ntake place simultaneously with the cessation of the fever, and were\r\nformerly regarded as critical discharges. The return to health is\r\nusually rapid, and very rarely retarded by the occurrence of\r\ncomplications or relapses, as in typhoid fever. The disease itself\r\nleaves no tendency to any other disease.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL SYMPTOMS.--The appearance of a patient with\r\ntyphus fever is pathognomonic, and is often alone sufficient to enable\r\n{348} a physician or nurse familiar with it to recognize the disease\r\nwhen brought in contact with it. The surface generally is congested;\r\nthe face is flushed, and in bad cases dusky red or even livid in hue;\r\nthe expression is dull and vacant, except during delirium, when it may\r\nbe wild or even fierce; the conjunctivæ are injected, the eyes watery,\r\nand the teeth encrusted with sordes. The skin is generally hot and\r\ndry, except toward the close of bad cases, when it may be cool and\r\nbathed in a profuse sweat.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms connected with the nervous system are among the most\r\ncharacteristic of the disease, and of them none is more marked than\r\nprostration. It shows itself early, the patient usually taking to his\r\nbed immediately after his seizure or within a few days of it. It is\r\nmuch rarer than in typhoid fever to meet with walking cases of typhus,\r\nbut Buchanan[22] mentions that patients with the rash already out upon\r\nthem do occasionally present themselves at the out-door department of\r\nthe London Fever Hospital. It generally increases as the disease\r\nprogresses, and is often accompanied by a tendency to syncope. It may\r\nattain such a degree that the patient is unable to turn himself in bed\r\nor to help himself in any way. Among the most distressing sensations\r\nwhich attend this condition of excessive feebleness is a feeling as if\r\nhe were sinking into the earth with nothing to support him. Headache\r\nis also an early symptom. It is often observed among the prodromata of\r\nthe disease, and when these are absent supervenes directly after the\r\nchill. It is usually frontal, but may be diffused. It is generally\r\ndull and heavy, but is sometimes acute, and may be accompanied by a\r\ntendency to vertigo, increased by sitting up, and by pains in the back\r\nand limbs. It becomes more severe with the progress of the disease\r\nuntil the occurrence of delirium, when it is, as a rule, less\r\ncomplained of. With the headache there is generally some dulness of\r\nintellect, except in mild cases. This may be slight at first, and may\r\ncontinue so throughout the whole course of the attack, exhibiting\r\nitself principally in some confusion as to dates. In more severe cases\r\nit is much more marked, and may finally pass into actual stupor. On\r\nthe other hand, it may be entirely absent, even in severe attacks, as\r\nin a case reported by Da Costa and in some cases recently observed by\r\nmyself. It is usually soon replaced by delirium, which may be low and\r\nmuttering or wild and noisy, the former being the more common.\r\nDelirium is said to occur most frequently among the educated classes\r\nand those oppressed with care and anxiety, but is not rare among those\r\nwho occupy a lower position in the social scale, especially the\r\nintemperate. It is, as a rule, most marked at night, and in mild cases\r\nmay occur only at that time or upon waking in the morning. When the\r\ndelirium is active the patient may shout and scream, or leave his bed\r\nand attempt to throw himself from the window, being endowed apparently\r\nfor the moment with strength sufficient to enable him to commit these\r\nacts of violence. After the paroxysm is over he sinks back in bed\r\nexhausted. The confusion of intellect or delirium continues in bad\r\ncases until death supervenes or until the establishment of\r\nconvalescence. Indeed, the mental disturbance does not always end with\r\nthe latter, and it is not rare for feebleness of intellect to persist\r\nfor some time after the patient has in other respects regained his\r\nusual health, and in a few cases insanity has followed an attack of\r\ntyphus fever. Among the most {349} formidable of the symptoms of\r\ntyphus are convulsions, which are fortunately of infrequent\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nThe patient generally suffers from wakefulness, except during the\r\nfirst few days. When sleep is obtained it may be unrefreshing or\r\nbroken and disturbed by dreams. In other cases the opposite condition\r\nof somnolence may be present. Occasionally, after having apparently\r\nslept for hours, he may deny having been asleep at all. This\r\ncondition, which constitutes the coma vigil of Chomel, is entirely\r\ndistinct from that described by Jenner under the same name, in which\r\nthe patient lies with his eyes wide open, gazing into vacuity, his\r\nmouth only partly closed, his face pale and devoid of expression, and\r\nwhich is invariably fatal. Muscular tremor is more or less present in\r\nall cases of the disease, and in bad cases may be a prominent symptom.\r\nThe disease, when this symptom is marked, especially if there is at\r\nthe same time low, muttering delirium and a moist skin, presents a\r\nconsiderable degree of resemblance to delirium tremens. There is very\r\noften intolerance of light, tinnitus aurium, and loss or perversion of\r\nthe senses of taste and smell. Deafness is also not uncommon, and is\r\nregarded by many authors as a favorable symptom. In bad cases, in\r\naddition to subsultus tendinum, there are carphologia, incontinence or\r\nretention of the urine, and paralysis of the sphincter ani.\r\n\r\nSome discrepancy is found to exist in the statements of different\r\nauthors in regard to the temperature curves of typhus fever. They all\r\nagree, however, in assigning them certain characters, the knowledge of\r\nwhich is often of great assistance in diagnosis. One of these is a\r\nrapid rise of temperature immediately after the invasion of the\r\ndisease. Wunderlich[23] asserts that he has observed a temperature of\r\n104.9° F. on the evening of the first day, and Lebert has found it as\r\nhigh as 106.4° F. on that of the second. Such temperatures, occurring\r\nso early in the disease, must be infrequent, as Murchison has never\r\nmet with them. Usually, the temperature attains its maximum on the\r\nthird or fourth day. The maximum is about 104° or 105° F. Murchison\r\nsays it scarcely ever reaches 106°, except in children, in whom it\r\nrarely is as high as 107°, but Lebert states that he has known it to\r\nbe as high as 107.8°. On the other hand, it may never exceed 103°,\r\neven in fatal cases. When the maximum is attained early in the disease\r\nthere may be for several days, or until defervescence takes place,\r\nvery little variation in the evening temperatures, but, as a general\r\nrule, they are slightly less elevated in the second than in the first\r\nweek. This usually occurs from the tenth to the fourteenth day, but it\r\nmay be postponed until the eighteenth, or even until much later. In\r\nsome cases on the day before the crisis a slight fall, and in others a\r\nconsiderable fall with a subsequent rise of temperature, are observed.\r\nDefervescence is often very rapid, the temperature falling five or six\r\ndegrees in the course of twelve hours. A true lysis is rarely\r\nobserved. The occurrence of a complication in the course of a disease\r\nwill not only cause a decided rise of temperature and a modification\r\nof the temperature curve, but may also postpone defervescence beyond\r\nthe usual time. Not infrequently the thermometer indicates subnormal\r\nmorning temperatures with slight evening rises for several days after\r\nthe crisis, unless complications arise, {350} when fever of the hectic\r\ntype may occur. A very slight cause will also often produce a\r\nconsiderable, although temporary, elevation of temperature in this\r\ncondition. The morning remissions are less decided than in typhoid\r\nfever, especially in the first week. As a rule, they do not exceed 1°,\r\nbut Lebert lays stress upon the fact that in the same curve variations\r\nfrom 0.3° to 1.8° and from 0.6° to 2.1° often occur. Cases which\r\nterminate fatally are generally characterized by high fever, with\r\nabsence of the morning remissions, which may continue uninterruptedly\r\nthrough the second and even the third week. During the death-agony\r\nthere is frequently a rise of temperature of two or more degrees. A\r\nvery high temperature in the first week is often the forerunner of\r\nsevere cerebral symptoms in the second, and a fall of temperature\r\nunaccompanied by an improvement in the other symptoms is not always\r\nindicative of the approach of convalescence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _On the Temperature in Disease_, New Sydenham Society's\r\ntranslation, London, 1871.]\r\n\r\nAnorexia is generally present in typhus fever from the beginning of\r\nthe attack, and may persist until its close. It is not, however,\r\nusually attended by the same repugnance for food as in other fevers.\r\nPatients can generally be persuaded at first to take nourishment.\r\nIndeed, Dr. Gerhard asserts that the negroes who fell under his care\r\nin 1832 frequently asked for solid food. Nausea and vomiting are rare\r\nsymptoms; the latter may occur late in the disease, and then, not\r\ninfrequently, is caused by irritation of the brain. Thirst is present\r\nin all cases. In the later stages of the disease, when the senses are\r\nblunted, water may not be asked for, although urgently called for by\r\nthe condition of the system. The bowels are, as a rule, constipated in\r\nthis disease. The exceptions to this rule are, however, more numerous\r\nthan is usually thought. Wood[24] says that he has frequently seen\r\ndiarrhoea in typhus fever when it occurs in recently-arrived\r\nimmigrants. Da Costa[25] mentions that it has occurred in several of\r\nthe cases which have come under his care, and Buchanan[26] says that\r\nhe has observed it in at least one-third of the patients admitted into\r\nthe London Fever Hospital in recent years. When there is no diarrhoea\r\nthe stools are of normal color and consistence. When it exists they\r\nare watery and usually dark greenish in color, and never present the\r\npeculiar ochrey-yellow appearance seen in typhoid fever. They are said\r\nto be alkaline in reaction. Tympanites is rare in typhus fever. It may\r\nbe present in cases in which there is diarrhoea, and may then be\r\nassociated with gurgling in the bowels, but rarely attains the degree\r\ncommon in typhoid fever. Gurgling when present is, moreover, not\r\nconfined to the right ileo-cæcal region, but may be produced in\r\ndifferent parts of the abdomen by pressure. There may also be\r\ntenderness in the epigastric and hepatic regions, but the enlargement\r\nof the spleen so constantly observed in typhoid is generally wholly\r\nwanting in this fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nThe tongue in the beginning of the disease is covered with a thin\r\nwhitish fur and is moist, and may continue so throughout in mild\r\nattacks. Generally, however, it soon becomes dryish, and in bad cases\r\nabsolutely dry, and is tremulous when put out of the mouth, while its\r\ncoating becomes thicker and brownish, and finally brown, or even black\r\nand cracked. It is rare to see the tongue itself fissured as in\r\ntyphoid fever. Less frequently it remains red, smooth, and glazed\r\nthroughout the attack. Occasionally the tongue is contracted in bulk,\r\nand it may {351} then, in consequence of its dryness and that of the\r\nmouth, be impossible to protrude it. Sordes frequently collect about\r\nthe gums and lips in severe cases.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is usually increased in frequency in typhus fever, and\r\nvaries from 100 to 120, but in many cases it never rises above 90, and\r\nin very severe cases it may be as high as 150. This increase is\r\nobserved from the beginning, and generally bears some proportion to\r\nthe severity of the fever; but toward the close, when the prostration\r\nis great, the pulse may continue frequent even after a fall in\r\ntemperature has taken place, and is always more frequent when the\r\npatient is sitting up than when he is lying down. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, a very slow pulse is associated with symptoms of great\r\nseverity. When this association occurs the prognosis is grave. In the\r\nyoung and robust the pulse may be full and bounding, but it is more\r\noften compressible or small and weak. It is not so often dicrotic as\r\nin typhoid fever. There is sometimes, according to Lyons, a singular\r\nwant of uniformity in the force and volume of the arterial pulse in\r\ndifferent parts of the system, and there may be but one pulsation at\r\nthe wrist for two of the heart. A very sudden fall in the frequency of\r\nthe pulse without an improvement in the other symptoms is not a\r\nfavorable indication, as it may be due to impaired innervation or to\r\ndegenerative changes in the muscular tissue of the heart. Usually the\r\nbeginning of convalescence is marked by a gradual fall of the pulse.\r\nLater it may fall to 50 or below it, and continue slow for some time,\r\njust as it does in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThe heart shares in the general enfeeblement of the system. In severe\r\nattacks the impulse soon becomes weak and diffused, and may be\r\nentirely absent for some time even in cases which eventually terminate\r\nin recovery. Stokes long ago called attention to an alteration in the\r\nsystolic sound of the heart which he taught indicated the urgent\r\nnecessity for the administration of stimulants. This sound is observed\r\nin the progress of the disease to become shorter and less distinct,\r\nand finally inaudible, while the second sound is unaffected. This\r\nmodification of the heart-sounds is always an accompaniment of great\r\nprostration. Occasionally the first sound is replaced by a functional\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic eruption of the disease is generally preceded by\r\nthe fainter subcuticular mottling already alluded to, and usually\r\nappears between the fourth and seventh days, but it has been observed\r\nas early as the third day, and, on the other hand, its appearance is\r\nsaid by Wood to have been delayed until the thirteenth. It consists of\r\nminute spots with ill-defined margins, varying in size from that of\r\nthe point of a pin to two or three lines in diameter, irregular in\r\nshape, slightly elevated above the skin at first only, and occurring\r\nsingly or in groups. They are pinkish in color, and disappear readily\r\nunder pressure when first observed. They may then, as Gerhard and\r\nothers have pointed out, present a considerable resemblance to the\r\nrose-colored spots of typhoid fever. In the course of twenty-four\r\nhours they become brownish, and later, when the attack is a severe\r\none, livid in color. In malignant or even severe cases they are\r\nfrequently converted into true petechiæ. They do not appear in\r\nsuccessive crops, but usually require a couple of days for their full\r\ndevelopment. Their duration is variable. In mild attacks they may\r\ndisappear in the course of a few days, but in bad cases often {352}\r\npersist until after convalescence, and are recognizable after death.\r\nThey are confined to no part of the body, but appear usually earliest\r\nand most abundantly upon the folds of the axilla and upon the abdomen.\r\nOccasionally, however, they are first observed upon the wrists, and in\r\nsome cases are more numerous upon the arms and legs than upon the\r\nbody. They are rarely found upon the neck and face, but in children\r\nthe latter may be so much covered by them that the disease may be\r\nreadily mistaken for measles. They present some resemblance to\r\nflea-bites, but the latter may be easily distinguished from them by\r\nthe minute discoloration in the centre left by the puncture of the\r\ninsect. The eruption is oftenest wanting in young subjects. It is\r\nusually, but not invariably, most copious in severe attacks, but cases\r\nhave ended fatally in which it was wholly wanting from beginning to\r\nend. Its color is also to a certain extent an index of the severity of\r\nthe attack; the darker and more livid it is, the graver the prognosis.\r\nIn malignant cases or those complicated by scurvy, in addition to the\r\npetechiæ above referred to, purpura spots and vibices are not\r\ninfrequently observed. Some authors assert that the eruption is\r\nfollowed by a slight desquamation of the cuticle, but this is denied\r\nby others. Sudamina occasionally occur, but they are much rarer than\r\nin typhoid fever. The blue spots described by the French under the\r\nname of tâches bleuâtres are also sometimes met with.\r\n\r\nA very disagreeable odor is exhaled from the bodies of typhus-fever\r\npatients after the first week. Although readily recognizable by those\r\nwho have once perceived it, it is difficult to describe. Gerhard spoke\r\nof it as pungent, ammoniacal, and offensive, especially in fat,\r\nplethoric individuals, and believed that those patients who presented\r\nthis symptom in the highest degree were most likely to communicate the\r\ndisease to others. Murchison has also expressed the opinion that the\r\ntyphus poison is associated with this odoriferous substance. Others\r\nhave compared the odor to the smell given off by rotten straw, the\r\nurine of mice, and various other substances. Wood says that he has\r\noften perceived the same odor in badly-ventilated rooms in which a\r\nnumber of people have been shut up together for some time.\r\n\r\nThe sensibility of the skin in cases in which the stupor is not so\r\ngreat as to render the patients insensible to all external impressions\r\nis said by some writers to be much increased. There is also\r\noccasionally so much tenderness in the epigastric region as to give\r\nthe impression at first to the attendant that there is inflammation of\r\nthe stomach or liver.\r\n\r\nPulmonary complications are quite frequent in typhus fever, and, as\r\nthey often come on insidiously and give no evidence of their presence\r\nby cough, expectoration, or even more hurried breathing, that is often\r\nseen in uncomplicated cases, it is well to make it a rule to examine\r\nthe chest of every patient with this disease. To do this thoroughly it\r\nis not necessary to make him sit up, which, where great prostration\r\nexists, is often attended with danger. If he be turned gently upon his\r\nside the auscultator will usually have no difficulty in ascertaining\r\nthe precise condition of his lungs.\r\n\r\nThe respiration is usually much more frequent in this disease than in\r\nhealth. Even in cases in which there is no disease of the lungs it is\r\noften as high as 30, and in cases in which there is such a\r\ncomplication it may be 60. Its frequency is generally proportional to\r\nthe severity of {353} the fever. On the other hand, in grave cases in\r\nwhich cerebral symptoms are predominant it may be reduced in frequency\r\nmuch below the normal. When coma or profound stupor exists, it may\r\nbecome jerking and spasmodic, or even simulate the stertorous\r\nrespiration of apoplexy. Bronchitis, if not of such constant\r\noccurrence as in typhoid fever, is certainly not rare. It usually\r\noccurs early in the attack, and makes itself known by the presence of\r\nsonorous and sibilant râles, which give place later to mucous râles.\r\nExpectoration is often absent in these cases; where it exists the\r\nsputa are either mucous or muco-purulent. In mild cases no further\r\nlesion of the lungs occurs. When the attack is more severe hypostatic\r\ncongestion is very likely to supervene. This is a condition which is\r\noften attended with danger, and which frequently, as has been said\r\nalready, escapes recognition unless the chest be thoroughly examined,\r\nwhen dullness on percussion, feeble respiration, and subcrepitant\r\nrâles may readily be detected. Occasionally the physical signs\r\nindicate the existence of pneumonia. This, when it occurs in the\r\ncourse of this disease, is always of low grade, and is attended by the\r\nexpectoration of mucus streaked with blood.\r\n\r\nThe breath of the typhus-fever patient has a very disagreeable odor,\r\nnot unlike that given off from the body, and is said by Murchison to\r\ncontain an increased amount of ammonia.\r\n\r\nAccording to Parkes,[27] the changes in the urine are those usual in\r\nordinary pyrexia. During the fever it is generally diminished in\r\nquantity, dark in color, and of high specific gravity. It contains an\r\nincreased amount of urea and of uric acid, the latter of which is not\r\ninfrequently spontaneously precipitated. Sulphuric acid is also in\r\nexcess. On the other hand, the chlorides are diminished in amount or\r\nentirely absent. This diminution cannot be ascribed to a decrease in\r\nthe quantity ingested, for when they are administered with the food\r\nthey are not found to be eliminated by the kidney. The amount of\r\nphosphoric acid does not appear to be affected by the disease. The\r\nurine is acid in reaction at first, but its acidity soon diminishes,\r\nand it may become alkaline toward the close of bad cases. It may also\r\ncontain albumen, or even blood, the former being present oftenest in\r\ncases characterized by high temperature. According to Da Costa,\r\ntube-casts are more often present than absent in severe cases. Those\r\nseen by this observer were either coated with rather opaque epithelial\r\ncells, many of which were finely granular or covered with granules,\r\nwhich, when tested with reagents, were sparingly soluble in acetic\r\nacid, and which with very high magnifying powers did not present the\r\nround shape of oil, and were probably the urinary salts collected in\r\nthe tube-casts. The crisis is sometimes marked by a copious deposit of\r\nurates. During convalescence the urine is usually increased in\r\nquantity, is pale and limpid, and of low specific gravity, and is\r\nfound to contain the chlorides in gradually increasing quantity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _The Composition of the Urine, etc._, by Edmund A.\r\nParkes, M.D., London, 1860.]\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.--Many of the varieties of typhus fever recognized by\r\nauthors--as, for example, jail fever, ship fever, camp fever, and\r\nhospital fever--really differ in nothing but name and the\r\ncircumstances under which the disease has arisen. Others are mere\r\nmodifications of it, due to the predominance of one symptom or of a\r\ncertain set of symptoms or to the intercurrence of a particular\r\ncomplication, and likewise do not {354} need a full description here.\r\nTo this latter class belong the inflammatory typhus, the nervous or\r\nataxic typhus, the adynamic typhus, and the ataxo-adynamic typhus of\r\nMurchison. The first variety occurs in young and robust subjects, and,\r\nit is also said, in persons of the upper class. It is characterized by\r\nhigh fever, intense headache, and active delirium. In the second\r\nvariety the nervous symptoms, such as delirium, somnolence, stupor,\r\nand muscular tremblings, are the most prominent. The most marked\r\nfeature of the third variety is the excessive prostration, which is\r\nshown in the feebleness of the heart's action and the loss of muscular\r\nstrength and of control over the sphincters. In this form the eruption\r\nis dark colored. Purpura spots and vibices also are very apt to\r\nappear, and even hemorrhages from the gums, nose, or other parts to\r\noccur. In the ataxo-adynamic form the symptoms of the ataxic and those\r\nof the adynamic form are found united. In addition to these there are\r\ncertain other varieties, arising from differences in degree. These\r\ndifferences are sometimes owing to diversities in the constitution and\r\nhabits of the patient, sometimes to variations in the character of the\r\nepidemic, and are sometimes not readily explainable. One of these is\r\nthe mild form, in which the symptoms are those of moderate fever, and\r\nin which the disease may run its course in seven days. In this form\r\nthe temperature may never rise above 102° F., the eruption be absent\r\nor very scanty, and the characteristic stupor or dulness be wholly\r\nwanting. Unless complications arise recovery invariably takes place. A\r\nwalking form of typhus fever, as has already been said, is much rarer\r\nthan of typhoid, but it does sometimes occur, Dr. Buchanan having\r\noften seen the eruption out upon patients who have walked to the\r\nLondon Fever Hospital to seek admission. In this form the disease,\r\nhowever, does not always run a mild course, as alarming prostration is\r\nvery apt to come on later in its course. Another variety, the abortive\r\nform, has been described by authors. In this an individual, in due\r\ntime after exposure to the contagion, may present all the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of typhus fever, but the disease, instead of\r\nrunning its usual course, may terminate abruptly with a critical\r\ndischarge of some kind. This form occurs during epidemics, and is\r\nanalogous to the abortive attack of scarlet fever or some other\r\ndiseases which are occasionally met with. On the other hand, a very\r\nsevere form, the typhus siderans of authors, also sometimes occurs. In\r\nthis variety the temperature rises rapidly, and soon attains its\r\nmaximum; there are frequent pulse and respiration, severe headache,\r\nand early delirium and stupor. The mortality in this form is very\r\ngreat. Very frequently death takes place so rapidly as often to leave\r\nthe physician in some doubt as to the nature of the disease in those\r\ncases in which exposure to the contagion cannot be positively traced.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--The complications of typhus fever often\r\nexercise a decided influence upon the course of the disease, for they\r\nnot only retard convalescence, but are often the immediate cause of\r\ndeath. Their early detection, therefore, becomes a matter of the\r\ngreatest importance. They will be found to vary in different years,\r\none epidemic being characterized by complications which are entirely\r\nwanting in the next. Among the commonest of them are several different\r\nconditions of the respiratory organs. Bronchitis, if not quite so\r\nfrequent as in typhoid fever, occurs in a large number of cases. It\r\nmay come on at any stage {355} of the disease, either immediately\r\nafter the beginning of the attack or in its course, or not until\r\nconvalescence. In cases accompanied by prostration mucus may\r\naccumulate in the bronchial tubes, and be the cause of the patient's\r\ndeath by preventing the due aëration of the blood. It would seem to be\r\nan especially frequent complication in Ireland, and it is rather\r\nsurprising that so acute an observer as Graves appears not to have\r\nbeen aware of its real relation to typhus, and speaks of it as if it\r\nwere a predisposing cause. \"Nothing can be more remarkable,\" he says,\r\n\"than the facility with which a simple cold, which in England would be\r\nperfectly devoid of danger, runs into maculated typhus in Ireland, and\r\nthat, too, under circumstances quite free from even the suspicion of\r\ncontagion; in truth, except when fever is epidemic, taking cold is its\r\nmost usual cause.\" A much more serious complication than bronchitis is\r\nthe form of pneumonia already alluded to as liable to occur in the\r\ncourse of typhus. This may often occur so insidiously that it may be\r\nconsiderably advanced before its presence is even suspected; hence the\r\nnecessity for examining carefully the lungs of every patient with this\r\ndisease who comes under our care. Generally, however, it makes itself\r\nknown by giving rise to rapid breathing and great lividity of the\r\nsurface, but, as has already been said, both of these symptoms may\r\nexist in cases in which there is no chest complication. This\r\npneumonia, if it does not immediately prove fatal, may, by becoming\r\nchronic, retard the convalescence. It occasionally is followed by\r\ngangrene, and sometimes by phthisis, which may then run a very rapid\r\ncourse. Phthisis is, however, a much less frequent sequela of typhus\r\nthan of typhoid fever. Pleurisy may also complicate typhus fever, but\r\nit is much more rarely met with than pneumonia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps next in frequency to pneumonia and bronchitis are diseases of\r\nthe kidneys. These are very serious complications, whether they\r\nantedate the fever or have occurred in its course. Careful examination\r\nof the urine will generally lead to the discovery of a small amount of\r\nalbuminuria in bad cases, but this is fortunately, in the majority of\r\nthem, only temporary. The urine should, however, always be re-examined\r\nbefore the discharge of the patient, as there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that many otherwise inexplicable cases of chronic albuminuria\r\nhave originated in an attack of typhus. The presence of albumen and of\r\ncasts in the urine of a patient apparently convalescent from this\r\ndisease should therefore make us careful in our prognosis as to his\r\nfuture health. The occurrence of diarrhoea may also very seriously\r\naffect the patient's chances of recovery. Dysentery has also been\r\nobserved in certain epidemics in Ireland, and is not infrequent when\r\nthe disease breaks out in besieged towns or when it occurs in summer.\r\nIn grave cases or those complicated with scurvy the blood may be so\r\nbroken down as to escape readily from the vessels. Under these\r\ncircumstances, in addition to the purpura spots beneath the skin, we\r\nmay have epistaxis, hæmoptysis, hæmatemesis, intestinal hemorrhage, or\r\nhemorrhage from any other part. Erysipelas, too, may be a troublesome\r\ncomplication, for not only does it exhaust the strength, but, when it\r\ninvades the mucous membrane of the larynx, as it sometimes does, it\r\nmay prove rapidly fatal by producing oedema of the glottis.\r\nDegeneration of the muscular structure of the heart may also take\r\nplace. This gives rise to a slow and feeble pulse and to a disposition\r\nto syncope. Bed-sores are not so frequent as in typhoid fever. They\r\n{356} do, however, sometimes occur, as does also gangrene of the toes\r\nand of other parts not subjected to pressure.\r\n\r\nLess common complications are jaundice, peri- and endo-carditis,\r\nmeningitis, local and general paralyses, cancrum oris, a diffuse\r\ncellular inflammation ending in purulent infiltration, and\r\ninflammatory swellings of the glands, or buboes. The salivary\r\nglands--and especially the parotid gland--are very apt to be affected\r\nby this inflammatory swelling. This occurs rapidly, is very tender,\r\nand in most cases soon runs on to suppuration, although it\r\noccasionally in children spontaneously subsides. It may occur at any\r\ntime during the course of the fever, or not until convalescence, and\r\nsometimes affects the glands of both sides of the face. These buboes\r\nform a connecting link between typhus fever and the Oriental plague,\r\nand Murchison says that the distinguished Egyptian physician Clot Bey,\r\non seeing some cases of the former disease complicated with parotid\r\nswellings, declared that in Egypt they would be regarded as examples\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nMany of the above-named complications may occur also as sequelæ, and\r\nin addition to these we may have pyæmia, giving rise to purulent\r\ncollections in the joints and phlegmasia alba dolens. The last named\r\nis not in itself serious. Its chief danger is from the breaking down\r\nof the clot and the subsequent occurrence of embolism.\r\n\r\nMenstruation is said not to be uncommon in the early stages of typhus\r\nfever, and may be so profuse as to greatly increase the prostration or\r\neven to cause death. According to Murchison, miscarriage does not\r\ninevitably occur when pregnant women are attacked with the disease,\r\nand if it does occur it is not necessarily fatal to either mother or\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.--Emaciation when death has occurred early in\r\nthe course of the disease, and is due solely to the violence of the\r\nfever, is usually not well marked, but in those cases which have been\r\nprotracted through the intercurrence of complications it may sometimes\r\nreach an extreme degree. Bed-sores, except under the circumstances\r\njust mentioned, are also rare. Rigor mortis is generally not well\r\ndeveloped, and is of short duration. In a few cases it would seem,\r\nhowever, to have been well marked. The typhus maculæ are persistent\r\nafter death, and so are any purpura spots and vibices which may have\r\nbeen present during life, but the subcuticular mottling usually\r\ndisappears. The skin of the dependent portions of the body is\r\ndiscolored by the settling of blood in it, and putrefactive changes\r\nare apt to set in rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe only constant lesion observed is a profound alteration of the\r\nblood, which is darker in color and abnormally fluid. If clots are\r\nfound at all, they are large, soft, and friable. The fibrin is\r\ndiminished in amount. In the early part of the disease the red\r\nblood-corpuscles are said to be slightly increased in number, but\r\nlater they are diminished, and under the microscope are observed to be\r\ncrenated and not to form themselves readily into rouleaux. The white\r\ncorpuscles are increased in number. No accurate chemical examination\r\nof the blood appears to have been made. Many of the post-mortem\r\nappearances which have been described as characteristics of typhus\r\nfever are really the consequence of this abnormal condition of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory organs generally present evidences of disease; the\r\nlesions of laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, hypostatic congestion of\r\nthe {357} lungs, and pleurisy have all been observed after death from\r\ntyphus fever. Usually, the traces of previous inflammation of the\r\nlarynx are but slight; in a few cases, however, ulceration has been\r\nfound, but the ulcers are stated to be always minute and superficial.\r\nUlcers are also occasionally found in the bronchi, and frequently\r\nindicate by their appearance the pre-existence of a much higher grade\r\nof inflammation. The bronchial mucous membrane is, however, oftener\r\nmerely reddened and softened and covered with a tenacious frothy\r\nsecretion. True pneumonia is of infrequent occurrence as compared with\r\nthat of hypostatic congestion of the lungs, but it nevertheless does\r\noccur, and may be of either the catarrhal or croupous variety. When\r\npleurisy exists, it is usually accompanied, according to Murchison, by\r\npurulent effusion into the pleural cavity. On the other hand, Lebert\r\nsays the variety of inflammation of the pleura oftenest met with is\r\nthe plastic. The intestines present no constant lesion. Gerhard says\r\nthat in fifty examinations there was but in one case, and that\r\ndoubtful in diagnosis, the slightest deviation from the natural\r\nappearance of the glands of Peyer. In a few cases the Peyer's patches\r\nhave been found more prominent than usual, but not more so than they\r\nare in measles and in some other diseases. Lebert alone of recent\r\nauthors makes a contrary statement. In an epidemic at Breslau, he\r\nsays, the solitary glands, as well as the patches of Peyer, were the\r\nseat of small, isolated, and superficial ulcers, which were usually\r\nsituated in the vicinity of the ileo-cæcal valve. The mesenteric\r\nglands are generally unaffected, but in the Breslau epidemic just\r\nreferred to they were not infrequently found moderately swollen. In\r\ncases in which dysentery has occurred as a complication the\r\ncharacteristic appearances of the disease will of course be observed,\r\nas well as those of typhus fever. The spleen is generally softened and\r\nslightly enlarged. The enlargement is not, however, always present, as\r\nGerhard found it in one only out of every five or six of the cases\r\nwhich he examined. Extravasations of blood into its structure are\r\noccasionally met with. The liver is usually congested, somewhat\r\nenlarged, and frequently under the microscope presents the appearances\r\nof commencing fatty degeneration. The kidneys often present\r\nunmistakable signs of renal disease in the swollen granular and more\r\nor less fatty condition of their gland-cells according to the duration\r\nof the disease. The muscles are darker in color than in health. Under\r\nthe microscope they are found to have undergone the peculiar granular\r\nor waxy degeneration described by Zenker, and which have been fully\r\nreferred to in the article on typhoid fever. Extravasations of blood\r\nare occasionally found in them, which may soften and form\r\npseudo-abscesses.\r\n\r\nOther post-mortem appearances which are met with less frequently than\r\nthose above detailed are inflammation, and even ulceration, of the\r\nmucous membrane, of the bladder, inflammation of the salivary gland,\r\nperitonitis, and congestion of the pancreas and of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe muscular tissue of the heart is generally softened and easily\r\ntorn. It is not, however, as stated by some authors, invariably so,\r\nfor in several cases in which it was examined by Da Costa it had\r\nundergone this change in one case only, in which there was no reason\r\nto suspect previous disease of the heart. The alteration is similar in\r\nkind to that which takes place in the voluntary muscles. An effusion\r\nof serum, which may be of a deep-red color from the transudation of\r\nthe coloring matter of the blood, is {358} sometimes found in the\r\npericardial sac, as are ecchymotic patches upon the surface of the\r\nheart. The endocardium may be stained from the imbibition of blood. On\r\nthe other hand, endo- and peri-carditis are excessively rare.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the severity of the cerebral symptoms in typhus fever,\r\nthere are few or no important changes found in the brain or its\r\nmembranes after death. The sinuses are occasionally filled with dark\r\nfluid blood, and the appearances of congestion of the brain are\r\nsometimes present. In other cases there may be an increased amount of\r\nserum beneath the arachnoid and into the lateral ventricles, but not\r\nmore than is often seen after death from other causes. Very rarely a\r\nslight film of hemorrhage has been found in the cavity of the\r\narachnoid, and sometimes also the evidences of non-inflammatory\r\nsoftening of the brain. Actual inflammation of the meninges has only\r\nbeen detected in a very few cases. There may also be congestion of the\r\nspinal membranes, increase of the spinal fluid, and softening of the\r\ncord itself. The ganglia of the sympathetic system appear to undergo a\r\nform of granular degeneration.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The diseases which most closely resemble typhus fever are\r\ntyphoid fever, measles, meningitis, and typhoid pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which typhoid and typhus fever occur are\r\ndifferent. Typhoid is never generated by overcrowding, and if\r\ncontagious at all is much less so than typhus. Prostration occurs much\r\nearlier and is usually much more marked in the latter. The eruption in\r\nthe former does not appear until the eighth day, and comes out in\r\nsuccessive crops, and usually disappears under pressure as long as it\r\nlasts, and therefore may be easily distinguished from that of the\r\nlatter. The duration of typhus is from ten to twenty days; that of\r\ntyphoid is rarely less than twenty-one. Nevertheless, cases are\r\noccasionally met with in which it is impossible to arrive at a correct\r\nconclusion as to their nature unless some light is thrown upon it by\r\nthe existence of other and more characteristic cases in the same house\r\nor neighborhood. I have recently had under my care a case which\r\neventually proved to be typhoid fever, but which I and many others who\r\nsaw it at first believed to be typhus in consequence of the presence\r\nof an abundant eruption, which did not disappear under pressure, and\r\nwas finally converted into petechiæ.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of typhus is sometimes found upon the face, especially in\r\nchildren, and then presents a considerable similarity to that of\r\nmeasles, which, however, usually appears a little earlier. There is,\r\nmoreover, rarely the same amount of prostration or stupor in the\r\nlatter disease, which is also attended by coryza and more bronchial\r\ncatarrh than is often present in the former. The eruptions in the two\r\ndiseases differ. In measles it is crescentic in shape, and is more\r\nelevated than in typhus. It is also brighter in color, disappears\r\nunder pressure, except in malignant cases, as long as it lasts, and is\r\nfollowed by free desquamation of the cuticle, which is not often\r\nobserved in typhus. The temperature may be high in the former, but it\r\nusually falls upon the sixth day.\r\n\r\nIn meningitis the headache is much more severe, and does not disappear\r\nupon the occurrence of delirium. It may be so severe as to cause the\r\npatient to cry out. The senses are painfully acute. There are\r\nintolerance of light and sound, and some hypersensitiveness of the\r\nsurface, {359} strabismus, inequality of the pupils or some other\r\nlocal paralysis, and retraction of the head. Nausea and vomiting are\r\nmore common than in typhus, while the utter prostration of the latter\r\ndisease is wholly wanting, and so is of course the characteristic\r\neruption. The tâche meningitique is wanting in the latter, but too\r\nmuch reliance should not be placed upon either the presence or absence\r\nof this sign. The diagnosis is only likely to be difficult in those\r\ncases of typhus in which the delirium is active. In that form of\r\ntyphus in which the symptoms simulate those of delirium tremens some\r\ndifficulty may also be experienced in making a diagnosis, especially\r\nif the patient be a drunkard. In delirium tremens it will be\r\nremembered, however, that there is little or no elevation of\r\ntemperature, that the skin is bathed in perspiration, the tongue\r\nmoist, and the characteristic eruption absent. Typhoid pneumonia can\r\nbe distinguished from pneumonia complicating typhus fever by the\r\npresence of the eruption in the latter.\r\n\r\nOther diseases which have occasionally been mistaken for typhus fever\r\nare remittent fever, Bright's disease, giving rise to uræmia and\r\npurpura. It does not seem likely that even the severest forms of\r\nmalarial fever should ever present such a resemblance to typhus fever\r\nas to make the differential diagnosis a matter of difficulty; but it\r\nwould appear from the history of the latter disease given by Murchison\r\nthat such a mistake has occurred in some of the Spanish American\r\ncountries. The enlargement of the spleen and liver is much less marked\r\nthan in remittent fever, and the remissions of temperature are much\r\nless decided. Uræmia may at times present a good deal of resemblance\r\nto the condition often seen in typhus fever after the supervention of\r\ncoma or stupor, but the history of the case, the absence of fever and\r\nof eruption in the former, will generally enable us to distinguish\r\nbetween the two conditions. It should be remembered, however, that\r\nBright's disease may occur in the course of typhus fever. Purpura may\r\ngenerally be recognized by the absence of fever and by the occurrence\r\nof hemorrhages from the nose, gums, and bowels.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The age, habits of life, and previous condition of health,\r\nas well as the character of the prevailing epidemic, must all be fully\r\nconsidered before making a prognosis in any special case. The disease\r\nusually runs a much milder course in children and young people than in\r\nadults past thirty years of age. After this age the mortality\r\nprogressively increases, and in advanced life it becomes very high,\r\nbeing often as much as 50 per cent. or over. Sex does not of itself\r\nexercise much influence upon the course of typhus fever, for, although\r\na few more men than women die of it, this appears to be attributable\r\nto the greater prevalence of drinking among the former. Previous\r\nintemperance acts unfavorably by producing a degeneration of the\r\ntissues of the body, thus rendering the patient less able to withstand\r\nthe effects of the disease. Drunkards have therefore always furnished\r\na large proportion of the fatal cases. The mortality among patients\r\nwho are unfortunate enough to take typhus fever as they are\r\nconvalescing from other diseases is usually also very great. This has\r\noften been observed in general hospitals in which cases of fever as\r\nwell as those of other forms of disease are admitted. Fat, lymphatic,\r\nor muscular people more frequently die of it than those of a different\r\nconformation. Gerhard found it especially {360} fatal among negroes in\r\nthe epidemic of 1836, and Buchanan seems to have had a similar\r\nexperience at the London Fever Hospital. It is a fact noticed by\r\nEnglish writers that people of the better class, although seldom\r\nattacked by typhus, often suffer severely from it. The mortality is\r\nalways high among those patients who previously to contracting the\r\ndisease have been for some time deprived of sufficient food, or have\r\nbeen overworked, or who have been the subjects of mental anxiety,\r\nworry, or any other depressing emotion. It is high also among those\r\nwho in the beginning of the disease have exhausted their strength in\r\nthe vain effort to resist the disposition to go to bed. The chances of\r\nrecovery are, on the other hand, very much improved by the removal of\r\npatients from crowded, ill-ventilated houses to the wards of a\r\nspacious, airy hospital.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable symptoms are a profuse dark-colored eruption associated\r\nwith purpura spots and vibices, general lividity of the surface, great\r\ninjection of the pupils, and a dusky hue of the countenance; extreme\r\nprostration; an excessively frequent and feeble pulse, especially if\r\nit is at the same time irregular or intermittent; absence of the\r\ncardiac impulse and of the systolic sound; hurried and spasmodic or\r\nabnormally slow respiration; great dryness and retraction of the\r\ntongue; excessive prominence of the nervous symptoms, such as\r\nheadache, delirium, whether active or muttering; unequal or pin-hole\r\ncontraction of the pupils; strabismus or other local paralysis;\r\nsleeplessness; muscular tremblings; subsultus tendinum; carphology;\r\nprotracted hiccough; retention of the urine; relaxation of the\r\nsphincters of the bladder and rectum; coma and especially coma vigil,\r\nand convulsions; continued high temperature, rising instead of falling\r\nafter the tenth day, especially if it is associated with coldness of\r\nthe extremities and of the breath; a profuse perspiration without a\r\ngeneral improvement in the symptoms; diminution in the quantity of the\r\nurine, or the presence in it of albumen, blood, or casts; vomiting;\r\nand diarrhoea. Hope, however, should never be abandoned even in the\r\nmost unfavorable cases, as recovery has sometimes occurred when the\r\npatient seemed almost in articulo mortis. Convulsions are said to be\r\ninvariably followed by death, and Graves regarded the presence of the\r\npin-hole contraction of the pupils as of very grave import.\r\n\r\nFavorable symptoms are--reduction of the frequency of the pulse, a\r\nfall of temperature, a diminution of the stupor or a resumption of\r\nconsciousness, and a return of appetite and of moisture to the tongue.\r\nWhen the patient begins to improve he will often without assistance\r\nturn upon his side after having lain for a long time upon his back,\r\nand this change of position is sometimes the first indication of the\r\napproach of convalescence.\r\n\r\nThe mortality varies of course in different epidemics. The cases which\r\nhave come under my own care being too few in number to draw deductions\r\nfrom on this point, I must rely upon the experience of those whose\r\nfield of observation has been more extended than my own. According to\r\nMurchison, out of 18,268 cases of typhus fever admitted into the\r\nLondon Fever Hospital during twenty-three years, 3457 proved fatal,\r\nmaking a mortality of 18.92 per cent., or 1 in 5.28. Deducting 686\r\ncases fatal within forty-eight hours, the mortality falls to 15.76 per\r\ncent., or 1 in 6.34. Included among the fatal cases is a large number\r\nin which {361} the disease had run its course to a favorable\r\ntermination, and in which death was really due to sequelæ, such as\r\npneumonia, erysipelas, etc. Moreover, the death-rate in the hospital\r\nis greater than in the community, because children, who rarely die of\r\ntyphus fever, are seldom brought to it; while, on the other hand, it\r\nreceives a large number of the infirm and aged inmates of the\r\nmetropolitan workhouses. Making allowance for these sources of\r\nfallacy, Murchison believes that the actual mortality of typhus is not\r\nmore than 10 per cent. In Gerhard's cases the proportion of deaths\r\namongst the black was much greater than amongst the white men; thus,\r\nof the whites 1 died in 4-2/3, of the blacks 1 in 2-19/28. Amongst the\r\nwomen the reverse was true; thus, 1 white woman died in 4-3/5, but\r\nonly 1 colored woman in 6-1/2, nearly. Da Costa lost 6 out of 39\r\ncases. In one of the fatal cases the diagnosis was doubtful; in\r\nanother there was a great deal of previous disease; in two others\r\ndeath was due to complications--so that there were but two in which\r\nthe fatal result could fairly be attributed to the disease itself.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Typhus fever is an eminently preventible disease. It is\r\ntherefore proper that the description of its curative treatment should\r\nbe preceded by a few words in regard to its prophylaxis.\r\n\r\nIt is still an unsettled question whether or not typhus fever ever\r\noccurs de novo, and although the recent discovery by Klebs and others\r\nof bacillus peculiar to typhoid fever (the bacillus typhosus), and of\r\nspecial bacilli in other analogous diseases, renders it highly\r\nprobable that typhus fever has also its own bacillus, and that\r\ntherefore it is not likely to arise except as the result of infection,\r\nit must be admitted that it has often prevailed in localities into\r\nwhich it has not been possible to trace its importation. Under these\r\ncircumstances it will be well to refer to those conditions which are\r\nasserted by some authors to favor its spontaneous generation,\r\nespecially as these same conditions are certainly known to favor its\r\npropagation. It will not be necessary to do this at any great length,\r\nas they have all been fully described in discussing the etiology of\r\nthe disease. The most important of them is the overcrowding of human\r\nbeings, especially when combined with deficient ventilation,\r\ndestitution, and want of personal cleanliness. The knowledge of the\r\nlaws of hygiene is now so universally diffused that this combination\r\nof conditions never occurs at the present time to anything like the\r\ndegree it often existed in the eighteenth century, and consequently\r\nepidemics of this disease are not only less frequent, but are also\r\nmuch milder in character, than formerly. Much work, however, still\r\nremains for sanitarians in the improvement of the homes of the poor,\r\nwhich even in this country are too often overcrowded and\r\nill-ventilated.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the disease in a community will almost always be\r\nprevented by the prompt isolation of the first few cases. This can\r\noften be thoroughly done, if the patient is in easy circumstances, by\r\nplacing him in an upper room, which should be stripped of its carpets,\r\ncurtains, and other unnecessary furniture; by cutting off all\r\ncommunication between him and his attendants and the rest of the\r\nhousehold; and by the free use of disinfectants. The room should be\r\nairy, and to ensure good ventilation a window should be left partly\r\nopen. This may be done during the febrile stage, even in winter,\r\nwithout the risk of any injury to the patient. Among the poorer\r\nclasses, however, {362} isolation can rarely be effectually carried\r\nout, and it is therefore much better to remove the patient to a\r\nhospital. Upon the admission of such a patient to an institution of\r\nthis character his clothes should be at once disinfected. This may be\r\ndone by washing the underclothing in a disinfecting fluid, and then\r\nexposing them to a free current of air, and by subjecting the outer\r\nclothing to a very high temperature in an oven or to the fumes of\r\nburning sulphur. Murchison believes that a neglect of this precaution\r\nhas often been the cause of the extension of the disease to other\r\ninmates of the hospital, especially when the patient resumes during\r\nhis convalescence the same clothing he wore upon admission. If the\r\nhospital is a general one, he should be placed, whenever practicable,\r\nin a well-ventilated ward by himself or with other patients suffering\r\nfrom the same disease. As this is not always possible, the number of\r\nthe other occupants of the ward should be reduced and their beds\r\nplaced as far away as possible from his. As the infectiousness of\r\ntyphus fever is very much lessened by free ventilation, this\r\nprecaution is often alone sufficient to prevent its extension to them.\r\nIt is also well, however, to supplement it by the use of\r\ndisinfectants. The diffusion of a solution of carbolic acid in the\r\natmosphere of the ward by means of the steam atomizer has not only\r\nrendered the odor emanating from the patient less perceptible, but has\r\nalso appeared to diminish decidedly the risk of infection. As a still\r\nfurther precaution the patient may be sponged with a weak solution of\r\ncarbolic acid or some other disinfectant. His nurses should be\r\nselected, whenever practicable, from among those who have had the\r\ndisease themselves. They should never sleep in the sick room, lounge\r\nabout the patient's bed, or inhale his breath. They should be allowed\r\na certain amount of time every day for rest and recreation in the\r\nfresh air, and should have a full supply of nourishing food. On the\r\nother hand, they should be warned against the danger of\r\nover-stimulation, which is often resorted to in the hope of warding\r\noff the disease, and should be relieved as far as possible from\r\nattendance upon other patients. It may be well here to say that the\r\nnursing of a case of typhus fever should never be undertaken by the\r\nrelatives or friends of the patient, except as a matter of necessity.\r\nNot only do the anxiety and distress they naturally feel unnerve them\r\nand render them unfit to carry out the directions of the physician,\r\nbut they can rarely execute the many offices required in the sick room\r\nwith half the skill of a trained nurse or with so little annoyance to\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\nBefore the patient is allowed to leave his ward he should have a warm\r\nbath. If the disease has occurred in a private house, the room which\r\nhe has occupied should be thoroughly disinfected. This is best done by\r\nreplastering, repapering, and repainting it. In many cases, however,\r\nit will be sufficient to fumigate it with burning sulphur, and then to\r\nair it for several days. The bed and bedding should also be\r\ndisinfected, and, where this cannot be thoroughly done, the latter had\r\nbetter be destroyed.\r\n\r\nOf primary importance in the treatment of typhus fever is the\r\nregulation of the diet. Although there are no ulcers in the bowels in\r\nthis as in typhoid fever, and although, consequently, there is not the\r\nsame imperative necessity in this as in the latter disease to restrict\r\nthe patient to liquid articles of food, experience has shown that such\r\narticles are much more readily digested and assimilated than solids.\r\nThe diet {363} should consist, therefore, of milk, beef-tea, and\r\nchicken or mutton broth. Of all of these, milk is incomparably the\r\nbest, and it should form, unless the patient manifest an unconquerable\r\nrepugnance to its use, a large part of the nourishment in every case.\r\nFarinaceous articles of food are generally not well borne in this\r\nfever, because the diminution in the secretion of the salivary glands\r\nwhich almost always exists prevents their proper digestion. After the\r\nthird or fourth day nourishment should be given in small quantities at\r\nshort intervals, as every two hours, every hour, or even every half\r\nhour when the prostration is extreme. It should be the aim of the\r\nphysician to give an adult at least two quarts of milk or their\r\nequivalent daily.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to put a delirious patient under some\r\nrestraint to prevent him from leaving his bed or doing some other act\r\nof violence. Frequently a judicious nurse will be able to accomplish\r\nthis without the use of an undue amount of force, but at other times\r\nit will be necessary to have recourse to mechanical means of\r\nrestraint. Usually, all that is necessary is to pass a folded sheet\r\nacross the patient's chest, the ends of which are fastened to the\r\nsides of his bed.\r\n\r\nIt is now a universally accepted axiom among physicians that typhus\r\nfever is a self-limited disease, and that any attempts to cut it short\r\nis worse than useless. Not only do remedies which are employed for\r\nthis purpose often produce alarming prostration, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that they have in some cases been the cause of a fatal\r\ntermination, which under another plan of treatment would have been\r\naverted. During the last century it was not uncommon to bleed, and to\r\nbleed largely, in the beginning of an attack of typhus fever, but even\r\nthen there were physicians--as, for instance, O'Connell, Rogers,[28]\r\nPringle,[29] and Rutty[30]--who raised a warning voice against the\r\npractice. Sir John Pringle goes so far as to say that \"many have\r\nrecovered without bleeding, but few who have lost much blood.\" A very\r\nsimilar opinion was also expressed by Baron Larrey in the early part\r\nof this century. Indeed, it is very evident that the same difference\r\nof opinion existed as to the employment of venesection in the\r\ntreatment of acute affections when these authors wrote as prevailed in\r\nEngland and this country until within the last thirty years, and that\r\nthe disastrous results which occasionally follow the abstraction of\r\nlarge amounts of blood from patients affected with fevers and\r\ninflammations were as fully recognized then as now by many physicians.\r\nThis would seem effectually to dispose of the\r\nchange-of-type-in-disease theory which was generally accepted in the\r\nfirst half of this century as sufficient to explain the fact which\r\ncould no longer be overlooked that this class of patients did much\r\nbetter under a supporting than a depleting plan of treatment.\r\nPurgatives were also at one time freely given for the purpose of\r\narresting the disease, but the results obtained from their use were\r\nscarcely less unfavorable, and they are now never employed with this\r\nview. The use of quinia in large doses has also been advocated for the\r\nsame purpose, but experience, while it has shown that it is a valuable\r\nremedy, has demonstrated also that it does not possess {364} this\r\npower. Exactly the same thing may be said of the cold-water treatment\r\nof typhus fever. There is no evidence that it has ever shortened the\r\nduration of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _An Essay on Epidemic Diseases_, p. 60, by Joseph\r\nRogers, M.D., Dublin, 1734.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _A Chronological History of the Weather and Seasons, and\r\nthe Prevailing Diseases, in Dublin during the Space of Forty Years_,\r\nby John Rutty, M.D., London, 1770.]\r\n\r\nIf the physician is called to a case of typhus fever during the chill,\r\nbefore reaction has taken place, he will of course have recourse to\r\ndiffusible stimulants and external warmth to aid in the establishment\r\nof this process. More frequently he is not sent for until after the\r\nchill has been succeeded by fever. His treatment will then, of course,\r\nvary with the condition of the patient. If his stomach is loaded with\r\nfood, an emetic should be administered to him. If the bowels are\r\nconstipated, a mild cathartic will often be of service, but after the\r\nbowels have been once well moved it is generally unnecessary to\r\ndisturb them further. During the first day or two, while the fever is\r\nstill moderate in degree, and during the uncertainty which then\r\nusually exists as to the diagnosis, it will be sufficient to prescribe\r\nthe neutral mixture or the spirit of Mindererus in tablespoonful doses\r\nevery two or three hours. Upon the third day more active remedies will\r\ngenerally be required to reduce the temperature. This is best done by\r\nthe cold-water treatment in some form or other, or by the internal\r\nadministration of antipyretic doses of quinia. The manner in which the\r\ncold water is to be used and the cases to which it is applicable must\r\nbe left in a great measure to the judgment of the physician. In the\r\nform of the cold affusion it is now rarely resorted to, although\r\nCurrie[31] obtained most excellent results with it. It is calculated,\r\nhowever, to alarm a timid patient, and it is probably owing largely to\r\nthis fact that it has fallen into disuse. The cold bath, packing in a\r\ncold wet sheet, and sponging with cold water are the more usual means\r\nof employing cold in the treatment of typhus fever at the present day.\r\nThe cold bath is much used in Germany in the treatment of different\r\nforms of fever, and even of inflammation. It is also resorted to in\r\nthis country, but it has never attained the same popularity here as\r\nabroad. The best way of using it is as follows: The patient as soon as\r\nhis temperature rises above 103° F. should be placed in a bath having\r\na temperature between 80° and 90°, and which, whenever practicable,\r\nshould be brought to his bedside, as when he has to be carried to the\r\nbathroom he is sometimes not only alarmed and rendered very nervous by\r\nthe operation, but may exhaust himself in his struggles to free\r\nhimself from his attendants. After his immersion cold water should be\r\ngradually added until the temperature of the bath is between 60° and\r\n70° F. The length of time he should be allowed to remain in the bath\r\nwill of course depend upon circumstances. If shivering is produced by\r\nit, he should be at once removed from it and thoroughly dried and put\r\nback to bed. If no such symptoms are observed, he may be allowed to\r\nremain in it longer. As a general rule, a half hour is as long as will\r\nbe necessary or safe for him to continue immersed at any one time. His\r\ntemperature will usually continue to fall for some time after his\r\nremoval from the bath, but in the course of a few hours it will be\r\nfound to have risen again to 103° or over, when he should have another\r\nbath. In this way it may be necessary to repeat the baths from eight\r\nto twelve times a day. Some authors recommend that the patient should\r\nbe placed at once in a bath having a temperature of 50° F., {365} but\r\nthis method of applying cold possesses no advantage over that above\r\ndescribed, and is, like the cold affusion, very apt to excite alarm in\r\nthe patient. The cold bath is not, however, well borne by all persons,\r\nand alarming symptoms, and even fatal collapse, have followed its use\r\nin the old and feeble. It is also contraindicated when the skin is\r\ncovered with a profuse sweat or when the disease is complicated by an\r\ninternal inflammation. When the means of giving a cold bath are not at\r\nhand, the cold pack will often be found a very efficient substitute\r\nfor it. Sponging with cold water, although not so efficacious in\r\nreducing the temperature, has advantages over either of these methods\r\nof applying cold. In the first place, it is more agreeable to most\r\npatients and less calculated to excite alarm in those who are timid.\r\nAgain, it may be more frequently repeated, and may be used in cases in\r\nwhich the cold bath is contraindicated. Occasionally alcohol or\r\nvinegar may be added with advantage to the water, with the view of\r\nincreasing its refrigerant effects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold and Warm,\r\nas a Remedy in Fever and Febrile Diseases_, by James Currie, M.D.,\r\nF.R.S., London, 1805.]\r\n\r\nWhen quinia is given for the purpose of reducing the temperature in\r\nthe treatment of typhus fever, it must be used in large doses, as much\r\nas ten or fifteen grains repeated once or twice in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours being required for this purpose. When given in these\r\nquantities it has the disadvantage of producing deafness and\r\noccasionally of increasing the headache. I have therefore contented\r\nmyself in the cases which have fallen under my own care with giving it\r\nin more moderate quantities, in combination with one of the mineral\r\nacids, as, for instance, a couple of grains of quinia in solution with\r\nfrom eight to ten drops of dilute muriatic acid, repeated from four to\r\nsix times a day. The mineral acids were originally recommended in the\r\ntreatment of typhus fever in the belief that they neutralized the\r\npoison which caused the fever, and which was supposed to be ammonia or\r\nsome of its compounds. Although this theory is now no longer\r\nentertained, there can be no doubt that the tendency in this disease\r\nto the accumulation of ammonia in the blood is prevented by their\r\nadministration. Digitalis, aconite, or veratrum viride may also be\r\ngiven in appropriate doses if with a high temperature there coexists\r\ngreat frequency of the pulse. The first-named remedy is especially\r\nindicated if there is at the same time diminution of the secretion of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\nAs the disease progresses other symptoms present themselves for\r\ntreatment. One of the most urgent of these is the prostration. This\r\nnot only appears early, but is often extreme, and if not met by\r\nappropriate remedies will often of itself be sufficient to cause the\r\ndeath of the patient. As soon as it makes itself manifest stimulants\r\nmust be prescribed. These are, however, not to be resorted to simply\r\nbecause the patient has typhus fever. Many cases do perfectly well\r\nwithout them. In the young and robust it is often unnecessary to have\r\nrecourse to them. On the other hand, in the old, the feeble, and the\r\nintemperate they should be employed early. The rule laid down by\r\nStokes, that they should be administered as soon as the first sound of\r\nthe heart becomes indistinct and inaudible, may be adopted for our\r\nguidance in this respect. At first they should be given tentatively.\r\nIf the delirium, headache, and other nervous symptoms are increased\r\nafter their administration, it is best to withhold them. They should\r\nbe continued, on the other hand, when under their use the delirium\r\nceases or grows milder, the other nervous {366} symptoms subside, and\r\nthe patient falls into a refreshing sleep. The amount required to\r\nprevent fatal prostration will of course vary in each case. I have\r\nrarely myself found it necessary to prescribe more than half an ounce\r\nof whiskey or brandy every two hours, and frequently a very much\r\nsmaller quantity has been found sufficient. Cases are, however,\r\nreported in which from twenty to twenty-four ounces daily have been\r\ngiven with asserted advantage.\r\n\r\nAnother symptom which often demands prompt relief is the headache.\r\nWhen not severe, it may be relieved by the application of cold to the\r\nhead, either in the form of the ice-cap or by means of cloths\r\nfrequently wrung out of cold water, and by the administration of\r\nmoderate doses of potassium bromide; but when intense it requires more\r\nactive treatment for its removal, such as the application of cups to\r\nthe back of the neck or of leeches to the temples. General bleeding\r\nwill accomplish the same result, but the good which is done by it is\r\noften more than counterbalanced by the prostration it induces.\r\nSleeplessness is also sometimes the cause of a good deal of distress\r\nto the patient. When it occurs early in the disease and is caused by\r\nthe headache, it will generally subside under the use of the remedies\r\nwhich are employed for the relief of the latter symptom; but when it\r\ncomes on at a later period, it will often require special treatment.\r\nThere is some doubt as to the propriety of giving opium under these\r\ncircumstances, but Murchison, Gerhard, and others assert that it may\r\nbe given not only without injury, but with positive advantage to the\r\npatient. Graves was in the habit of combining it with a small quantity\r\nof tartar emetic in the condition in which the sleeplessness is\r\nassociated with active delirium. If, on the other hand, the delirium\r\nis of a low muttering character, it should be given with a diffusible\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\nIn this condition I have often found a pill containing a small\r\nquantity each of opium and camphor, frequently repeated, to answer an\r\nadmirable purpose, not only in procuring for the patient the needed\r\nrepose, but also in diminishing the restlessness, jactitation, and\r\nsubsultus tendinum. Opium should, however, not be used at all or used\r\nvery carefully in cases in which there is congestion of the lungs or\r\ndisease of the kidneys. The existence of the pin-hole pupil is also a\r\ncontraindication to its employment. In young and robust patients, if\r\nthe insomnia is attended by active delirium, chloral in twenty-grain\r\ndoses, repeated if necessary, may often be given with advantage, but\r\nit should never be prescribed in cases in which the action of the\r\nheart is feeble. Other remedies which have been recommended in the\r\ntreatment of this condition are belladonna, hyoscyamus, musk,\r\nchloroform, and cannabis indica. Potassium bromide appears to have no\r\npower to relieve it. No special modification of the above treatment is\r\nneeded when delirium occurs independently of sleeplessness and\r\nheadache. When the stupor is profound, efforts should be made to rouse\r\nthe patient by the use of counter-irritants to the shaven scalp or to\r\nthe nape of the neck. Murchison speaks well of the administration of\r\nstrong coffee under these circumstances. If there is at the same time\r\nsuppression or diminution of urine, diuretics should be administered\r\nin the hope of stimulating the kidneys to increased secretion.\r\nRetention of the urine is not an infrequent occurrence in this\r\ncondition, and the physician ought never, therefore, to accept the\r\nassertions of the {367} nurse or friends of the patient that the\r\nlatter has passed water, but should satisfy himself by an examination\r\nin regard to the condition of the bladder at every visit. He will\r\noften find that the apparent passage of urine is nothing more than the\r\ndribbling due to an over-distension of this organ. Neglect of this\r\nprecaution has occasionally been the cause of much subsequent distress\r\nto the patient, as cystitis is sometimes set up as a consequence of\r\nit. In one case which came under my observation, and in which this\r\nprecaution had been neglected, the patient suffered from incontinence\r\nof urine for some time after his recovery from the fever. Thirst is a\r\nsymptom which is always present and complained of at the beginning of\r\nthe fever, and usually bears some proportion to the severity of this\r\nprocess. Weak tea, an infusion of cascarilla-bark, and camphor-water\r\nhave all been recommended by different authors for its relief, but it\r\nis probable that no one of them possesses any superiority over water.\r\nIf the stomach is irritable and water is not retained, small pieces of\r\nice should be allowed to dissolve in the patient's mouth. Later, when\r\nthe stage of stupor supervenes, it is very important to see that the\r\npatient obtains a full supply of water. In this condition he will not\r\ncall for it, although it is even more urgently required than before.\r\n\r\nVomiting may occur at any time in the course of typhus fever. If it is\r\nobserved at the very beginning of an attack, an emetic will often\r\narrest it, but when it supervenes at a later period, it is generally\r\nof cerebral origin, and will usually subside under the use of the\r\nremedies already referred to which are prescribed for the relief of\r\nthe nervous symptoms. In addition to these, sinapisms may be applied\r\nto the epigastrium, and champagne, when the circumstances of the\r\npatient will permit it, should be given in the place of whiskey or\r\nbrandy. When everything is rejected by the stomach, recourse must be\r\nhad to nutritious enemata. Constipation is to be overcome by gentle\r\npurgatives, as the use of powerful cathartics is very apt to be\r\nfollowed by troublesome diarrhoea. If this should come on, it is best\r\ntreated by small doses of opium in combination with a mineral or\r\nvegetable astringent. When these fail, it may sometimes be relieved by\r\na prescription containing sulphuric acid and morphia, and at others by\r\nenemata of from twenty to thirty drops of laudanum in warm water. When\r\nglandular swelling occurs in the parotid region or in other parts of\r\nthe body, an effort should be made to promote resolution by painting\r\nthem with tincture of iodine. Blisters have also been recommended for\r\nthe same purpose, but they should be used carefully, as in low\r\nconditions of the system they are sometimes followed by sloughing of\r\nthe integuments. If these remedies fail, poultices should be applied.\r\nAs soon as pus has formed it should be evacuated by one or more free\r\nincisions.\r\n\r\nVery few attacks of typhus fever run their course without the\r\noccurrence of some pulmonary complication. When this is slight it\r\ndemands no special modification of the previous treatment, and it is\r\nsufficient to apply mustard poultices or stimulating liniments to the\r\nchest. But in cases of greater gravity, it matters not whether the\r\ncomplication is bronchitis, congestion of the lungs, or pneumonia, a\r\nmore active treatment is required. Under these circumstances the\r\nammonium carbonate in five-grain doses, given in mucilage of acacia,\r\nfrequently repeated, or from thirty minims to a teaspoonful of the\r\naromatic spirit of ammonia every {368} two hours, sufficiently\r\ndiluted, may be prescribed with great advantage. When gangrene\r\nsupervenes the prognosis is almost hopeless, but an effort should be\r\nmade to save the patient's life by the administration of potassium\r\nchlorate and of an increased amount of stimulus. Murchison also speaks\r\nwell of the inhalation of tar vapor and of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nAs the other complications of typhus are at least of as common\r\noccurrence in typhoid fever, it will avoid a good deal of useless\r\nrepetition to refer the reader to the article on the latter disease\r\nfor a description of the treatment which they render necessary.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be kept in bed for some time after the subsidence\r\nof fever. Although relapses are rare in this disease, recrudescences\r\nof fever not infrequently occur as a consequence of undue exertion in\r\nthe early part of convalescence. Syncope is also not infrequently\r\nproduced by the patient's sitting up too soon. The diet should be\r\ncarefully regulated until the recovery is complete. It should at first\r\nconsist wholly of liquid or semi-liquid articles of food, but later\r\nmeat in some digestible form may be allowed. Stimulants are often as\r\nurgently demanded at this time as during the fever itself. They should\r\nbe given as the strength returns in gradually diminishing quantities.\r\nThe length of time during which it is necessary to continue them will\r\ndepend in great measure upon the previous habits of the patient. As a\r\ngeneral rule, their use should not be abandoned until he is able to\r\nleave his bed, and they may often be continued after this with benefit\r\nto him. As convalescence progresses it will be well to substitute ale\r\nor porter for the brandy or whiskey the patient had previously taken.\r\nA return to health will also be promoted by the judicious use of\r\ntonics, such as iron, quinia, Huxham's tincture, tincture of nux\r\nvomica, the mineral acids, and even cod-liver oil in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{369}\r\n\r\nRELAPSING FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM PEPPER, M.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Febris recidiva, vel recurrens; Fièvre a rechutes; Fièvre\r\nrecurrente; Typhus icterodes, vel recurrens; Bilious Typhoid Fever;\r\nRückfall's Typhus; Tifo recidivo; Famine Fever, Hunger-pest,\r\nArmentyphus, Hunger-typhus, Spirillum Fever.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Relapsing fever is an epidemic contagious disease, the\r\nspecific cause of which is not certainly known, although a peculiar\r\nspirillum appears to be constantly present in the blood. It occurs\r\nchiefly among the over-crowded and destitute, but may spread widely\r\nwhen introduced among more favorably situated populations. Its\r\ninvasion is abrupt, and is marked by a distinct chill or rigor,\r\nfollowed quickly by high fever (104° to 106°), with severe headache\r\nand pains in the back and limbs. Delirium is comparatively rare. The\r\ntongue is heavily coated, and there are epigastric tenderness,\r\nvomiting, constipation, and enlargement of the liver and spleen, with\r\nfrequent jaundice. There is no characteristic eruption. These symptoms\r\ncease abruptly from the fifth to the seventh day, with copious\r\nsweating; but after an apyretic interval of about a week's duration a\r\nrelapse occurs similar to the first attack, but of less duration\r\n(three to five days). Second, third, or even more numerous relapses\r\nmay subsequently occur at less regular intervals. One attack does not\r\nprotect against a second one to the same extent as with other\r\ncontagious diseases. The mortality is usually small.\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--It is not important to\r\nconsider here at any length the history of this disease. Allusions to\r\nit were made by Strother, 1729, and by Huxham, 1752, but the first\r\nreliable account on record is the description of an epidemic in the\r\nyear 1739 by John Rutty.[1] Relapsing fever undoubtedly occurred at\r\ndifferent times and at various places during the next hundred years,\r\nalthough the records of it are scanty, and for the most part\r\nimperfect, owing chiefly to the want of a clear recognition of its\r\nessential difference from typhus and typhoid fevers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _A Chronological History of the Weather and Seasons_,\r\netc., London, 1770, pp. 75-90.]\r\n\r\nDuring the decade from 1842 to 1852 relapsing fever prevailed in a\r\nvery active and widespread form. Epidemics occurred in England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, in various parts of Germany, and it was during\r\nthis time that it was first observed and described in America. In\r\nJune, 1844, an emigrant ship from Liverpool came to America with\r\neighteen cases on board, which were taken to the Philadelphia and\r\nPennsylvania {370} Hospitals. In 1848 a few cases were imported by\r\nemigrants to New York, and in 1850 to Buffalo in the same way.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See _Fevers, their Diagnosis, Pathology, and Treatment_,\r\nMeredith Clymer, Phila., 1846, p. 99; _Clinical Reports on Continued\r\nFever_, A. Flint, Phila., 1855, p. 364; Dubois 1848.]\r\n\r\nThe next great outbreak of relapsing fever began in Odessa in 1863 and\r\nlasted until 1872. It prevailed in various parts of Russia, in\r\nGermany, France, and Great Britain, and for the first time occurred\r\nextensively in the United States, especially in Philadelphia and New\r\nYork. The present article is based largely on a study of this epidemic\r\nas it presented itself in Philadelphia during the years 1869-70, when\r\nthe writer, in conjunction with the late Edward Rhoads, had the\r\nopportunity of observing about two hundred cases, in the wards of the\r\nPhiladelphia Hospital. An admirable article on the same epidemic\r\nappeared from the pen of the late John S. Parry, in the _Amer. Jour.\r\nMed. Sciences_, N.S., vol. lx., Oct., 1870, p. 336.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1877 and 1880 relapsing fever occurred quite\r\nextensively at Bombay, and was there studied by Carter[3] and Lewis;\r\nand during 1879-80 it prevailed in Königsberg, an account of which\r\nepidemic has been published by Meschede.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Spirillum Fever_, by H. Vandyke Carter, M.D., London,\r\n1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd. lxxxvii. p. 393.]\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of relapsing fever is seen, therefore,\r\nto have been very extensive; and not only has it occurred in the\r\nabove-mentioned localities, but there have also been less extensive\r\noutbreaks in France, India, Egypt, Algeria, South America, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--In all probability the essential cause of relapsing fever is\r\na specific poison, but we know nothing of its real nature nor of the\r\nprecise conditions under which it originates. Recent investigations\r\nhave shown that the spirillum discovered by Obermeier is constantly\r\npresent during the febrile stages of relapsing fever, but it cannot\r\nyet be decided whether this minute organism is the actual cause or\r\nonly an invariable accompaniment of the disease.\r\n\r\nIt appears that conditions of destitution, filth, and intemperance\r\namongst an overcrowded population favor the development of the virus,\r\nand hence the epidemics have, as a rule, begun in towns, such as\r\nDublin, Glasgow, Odessa, St. Petersburg, Breslau, etc., where such\r\nconditions prevail. Great importance has been attached, in particular,\r\nto the scarcity of food and to destitution as powerful factors in\r\nfavoring the production of the disease. Some of its names\r\n(hunger-pest, hunger-typhus, famine fever) have been given with\r\nreference to this, and in the case of several outbreaks a careful\r\ncomparison has been made of the decrease of the food-supply and the\r\nconsequent advance in price of the staple commodities with the\r\ndevelopment and progress of the disease. Although this is in all\r\nprobability true of those centres where relapsing fever originates, it\r\nhas but a partial application to the secondary centres where the\r\ndisease is imported and develops.\r\n\r\nThe presence of destitution and filth, enfeebling the vitality of a\r\nsection of the community, would favor the spread of this as of any\r\nother specific fever, but there is considerable evidence to favor the\r\nview that the importance of starvation as a cause of the fever has\r\nbeen exaggerated. This was strongly urged by Parry[5] as the result of\r\nhis study of the {371} Philadelphia epidemic of 1870, and our own more\r\nextended observation showed that the vast majority of the patients\r\nappeared to be well fed. On the other hand, the influence of\r\novercrowding as favoring the development and spread of relapsing fever\r\nhas been clearly established by the study of many epidemics, as in the\r\nBreslau attack of 1868, reported by Wyss and Bock, where single\r\ntenement-houses furnished as many as seventy-one cases; in the\r\nEdinburgh epidemic of 1869 and 1870, where Muirhead found the\r\nbreathing-space allotted to each individual in the affected houses to\r\nvary from 250 to 400 cubic feet; and in the Philadelphia epidemic,\r\nwhere the observations of Parry and ourselves showed the presence of\r\nan extreme degree of overcrowding in most of the houses where the\r\ndisease broke out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Loc. cit._, p. 339.]\r\n\r\nNo age is exempt, but neither can it be said that age exerts any\r\ninfluence upon the occurrence or frequency of relapsing fever. Of 1164\r\ncases in the Philadelphia epidemic of 1869-70 in which the age was\r\nnoted, the result was as follows:\r\n\r\n                  Males.  Females.\r\n  Under 20         149       76\r\n  From 20 to 30    220      140\r\n  From 30 to 40    143      101\r\n  From 40 to 50    135       67\r\n  From 50 to 60     60       34\r\n  From 60 to 70     20        6\r\n  From 70 to 90      6        7\r\n                   ---      ---\r\n       Total       733      431 = 1164\r\n\r\nThe youngest cases were in children two or three years old; the oldest\r\npatients were women over eighty-five years old.\r\n\r\nSex exerts no influence, though, on account of the larger proportion\r\nof males likely to be exposed to the specific cause, the results of\r\nnearly all epidemics show a preponderance of male patients in the\r\nproportion of 33 per cent., 66 per cent., or even 85 per cent.\r\n(Meschede).\r\n\r\nNationality does not act as a predisposing cause,[6] except in so far\r\nas certain countries may present more frequently than others the\r\nconditions favorable for the development of this disease. Of 1170\r\ncases in Philadelphia in which the nativity was noted, 219 were Irish,\r\n61 English, 161 German, 729 American. Of the latter 729, about\r\none-half, or nearly 28 per cent. of the whole number, were negroes,\r\nwhile the negro population of Philadelphia was only about 3.3 per\r\ncent. of the total. This excessive proportion of cases among the\r\nnegroes was undoubtedly due in large part to the fact that in\r\nPhiladelphia overcrowding is notoriously more common and extreme among\r\nthem than in any other portion of the population, although it is also\r\nlikely that they present an excessive susceptibility to the virus of\r\nthis as of many other specific diseases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Hirsch's _Geog. and Hist. Pathology_, New Syd. Soc. ed.,\r\n1883, vol. i. p. 615.]\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to show some connection between the period of\r\nthe year or the atmospheric conditions and the rise and spread of\r\nepidemics of relapsing fever; but, as Murchison clearly showed, these\r\nepidemics are wholly independent of such influences. In Philadelphia,\r\nof 1176 cases in which the date of occurrence is known, there occurred\r\nin September, 1869, 4 cases; December, 1869, 6 cases; January, 1870, 5\r\ncases; February, 1870, 13 cases; March, {372} 1870, 124 cases; April,\r\n1870, 209 cases; May, 325 cases; June, 293 cases; July, 115 cases;\r\nAugust, 19 cases; September, 28 cases; October, 15 cases; November, 1\r\ncase; December, 2 cases; January, 1881, 2 cases; February, 1 case;\r\nMarch, 2 cases; May, 7 cases; June, 2 cases; September, 2 cases;\r\nOctober, 2 cases.\r\n\r\nOccupation exerts no predisposing influence, but in all epidemics the\r\ngreat majority of cases occur among the vagrant classes, who lead a\r\nprecarious life and commonly sleep in foul, overcrowded lodgings.\r\nMurchison noted that in the London epidemics a considerable proportion\r\nof cases occurred among recent residents, but he attributed this,\r\ncorrectly, not to any special local cause, but merely to the fact that\r\nthis floating population is largely of the vagrant type. In\r\nPhiladelphia a careful inquiry showed that recent residence produced\r\nno special predisposing influence, and a study of other epidemics\r\nconfirms this view.\r\n\r\nContagion is, however, the essential cause of the spread of relapsing\r\nfever when the virus has once been developed. It seems clear from the\r\ndistinct periods and from the widely-separated localities in which\r\ndifferent outbreaks of relapsing fever have occurred that its special\r\npoison is capable of being called into existence or activity by\r\nfavoring conditions. Murchison held the belief that it was very\r\nintimately connected with, if not generated by, destitution, and, as\r\nalready stated, much evidence exists to show that the disease is most\r\napt to break out after periods of scarcity; but no just and convincing\r\nproof exists that destitution, any more than over-crowding and other\r\ndepressing influences, can actually engender a specific contagium\r\ncapable of being transported to great distances and of originating\r\nwidespread outbreaks of the specific disease among differently\r\nsituated populations. It appears necessary to assume the existence of\r\nsome unknown special virus which finds its suitable nidus for\r\ndevelopment in the conditions attendant on filth and overcrowding, and\r\nwhich attacks with greatest facility the systems of those who are\r\nenfeebled by want and depressed by vitiated air. When once this\r\nspecific poison has been called into active existence, however, there\r\ncan be no doubt as to the fact that it can be carried by fomites, and\r\nthat it is given off from the bodies of relapsing-fever patients so as\r\nto affect any who may approach. Although a few observers have doubted\r\nthis contagiousness of relapsing fever, the evidence in its favor is\r\noverwhelming. In many epidemics, as in Philadelphia in 1869, its\r\ncontagiousness is at least as intense as that of typhus fever. A\r\nsingle case may, indeed, be admitted to a healthy family among the\r\nbetter classes or into the wards of a well-ventilated hospital without\r\npropagating the disease, although striking cases of contagion are on\r\nrecord where a patient has communicated the disease to all the members\r\nof a family favorably situated and living at a distance from any other\r\npossible source of contagion. On the other hand, if admitted to an\r\novercrowded and filthy lodging the disease is apt to spread rapidly.\r\nWyss and Bock report seventy-one cases as having occurred in a single\r\nlodging-house during the course of the Breslau epidemic of 1868, and\r\nin Philadelphia single houses in several instances furnished more than\r\na score of cases, and several short streets more than one hundred\r\ncases each.\r\n\r\nIn the Philadelphia Hospital twenty-three persons lying sick in the\r\nwards with other affections contracted relapsing fever from the\r\npatients {373} admitted with that disease; two of the visiting staff,\r\nfive resident physicians, and nine nurses also suffered attacks of\r\nvarying severity. This corresponds with the general experience of\r\nthose connected with fever hospitals during the prevalence of\r\nrelapsing fever.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of typhus and other contagious diseases, the distance\r\nat which relapsing fever can be contracted by direct contagion through\r\nthe atmosphere is a very short one, not exceeding a few feet at most.\r\n\r\nThe poison may be carried by fomites. Instances are on record where\r\npersons having visited infected districts have conveyed the disease to\r\nothers at a distance without contracting it themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen rooms which have been occupied by relapsing-fever patients are\r\nsubsequently occupied by other persons, these are very liable to\r\nacquire the disease. Parry relates two remarkable cases in which\r\nrelapsing fever was transported to a distance by infected clothes; and\r\nit has been more than once observed that during epidemics of this\r\ndisease laundry-women engaged in washing the clothes of fever\r\npatients, but without any means of more direct communication with the\r\nsick, were frequently attacked (Cormack, Wyss and Bock).\r\n\r\nIn connection with the etiology of relapsing fever it is necessary to\r\nconsider the rôle played by a minute organism which has been\r\nfrequently detected in the blood of patients suffering with this\r\ndisease. This spiro-bacterium was first observed in relapsing fever by\r\nObermeier[7] in 1873, and has since been identified as a spirillum or\r\nspiroechete. The very numerous observations of Obermeier, Albrecht, H.\r\nV. Carter, Motschutkoffsky, Koch, Cohen, Holsti, Enke, Meschede, and\r\nothers leave no doubt that this peculiar parasite does occur at least\r\nvery frequently in the blood of patients with this disease. The\r\nfailure to detect it, which has been reported by several good\r\nobservers, may readily have been due to the extreme delicacy of the\r\norganism, or to the neglect of the proper method of preparing the\r\nslides of blood for examination, or to delaying the examination of the\r\nblood until after death, when it rapidly disappears. Thus no value can\r\nbe attached to the negative observations of Rhoads and myself, made\r\nprior to Obermeier's discovery, since our method of examination was\r\nnot sufficiently exact.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Centralbl. f. die med. Wissensch._, 1873, No. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe following description of the mode of examining the blood, and of\r\nthe spirillum, is condensed from H. V. Carter's account: It is\r\nnecessary to employ magnifying powers of not less than 500 diameters.\r\nThe fresh blood may be examined immediately after obtaining it by\r\npricking the washed finger of the patient. For preservation dried\r\nspecimens are needed: a very thin layer of fresh blood is evenly\r\nspread with the needle over the glass cover, exposed to the weak fumes\r\nof a solution of osmic acid, and allowed to dry under protection from\r\ndust; the dried film of blood may then be treated with glacial acetic\r\nacid or may be stained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Spirillum from the blood in a case of\r\nrelapsing fever, X 700 (Koch).]\r\n\r\nThe spirillum [See Fig. 19] is a colorless, slender, twisted filament,\r\nwhich when quiescent has a length of 2.66 times the diameter of a\r\nblood-disc (1/1500 to 1/500 inch = 0.012 to 0.043 millimetre). When\r\nunfolded they become distinctly elongated. They are very narrow (not\r\nmore than 1/40000 inch), and present four to ten spiral turns; when\r\nfresh they are in active movement and unfold in part, becoming wavy or\r\nbent. They {374} resist the action of concentrated acetic acid, and\r\nare readily stained by certain dyes. In number, five or ten may be\r\nvisible in a field or they may be too numerous to count. They have not\r\nbeen detected either in the secretions or in the evacuations. Both\r\nKoch and Carter have succeeded in cultivating this special form of\r\nbacteria outside of the body.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the observations thus far made on this difficult\r\nquestion, the parasite is found first toward the close of the period\r\nof inoculation or soon after the beginning of the fever, or it may be\r\ndetected throughout the febrile stage; but shortly before the\r\ncessation of the fever it quickly disappears, to reappear at the time\r\nof the relapse. There would seem, therefore, to be some close\r\nconnection between the febrile paroxysms and this organism, and it is\r\nnot remarkable that many observers have concluded that this spirillum\r\nis the essential and specific cause of the fever, and that it is\r\nimpossible to have this disease present without the appearance of the\r\nparasite in the blood; nor that the name spirillum fever has been\r\napplied to the disease by Carter.\r\n\r\nSuch conclusions appear to be premature, however, and we prefer to\r\nregard the undoubted existence of the spirillum in the blood of\r\nrelapsing-fever patients as at present only an important aid in\r\ndiagnosis, and to await the occurrence of other epidemics and the\r\nrepetition of careful studies upon this organism, both within and\r\nwithout the human system, before venturing to decide whether it is\r\nmerely one of the phenomena of the disease or whether it is its true\r\ncause and specific contagious principle.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that both Carter and Koch have succeeded in\r\ninoculating monkeys with relapsing fever, and Motschutkoffsky[8] of\r\nOdessa, who had the opportunity of inoculating a human being, asserts\r\nthat he succeeded in producing the disease, and found the incubation\r\nperiod to be not less than five nor more than eight days. Carter also\r\ngives an interesting table[9] of six instances of inoculation, four of\r\nthem by cuts while making autopsies, with consequent development of\r\nrelapsing fever in each instance. Some allowance must be made for the\r\nfact that in all the instances of this series there had been exposure\r\nto contagion by close communication with fever patients, though this\r\nexposure had existed for several months previously without leading to\r\nthe development of relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Centralblatt f. d. med. Wissenschaften_, 1876, No. 11,\r\np. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Op. cit._, p. 403.]\r\n\r\nGENERAL CLINICAL DESCRIPTION.--After a period of not less than five or\r\nsix days from the reception of the contagion the disease begins {375}\r\nabruptly with a chill of variable severity, accompanied by headache\r\nand aching pains in the back and limbs. The patient feels weak and is\r\noften giddy, but is not always obliged to go to bed the first day.\r\nNausea and vomiting are among the earliest symptoms, and distress at\r\nthe epigastrium, with tenderness, may attend or even precede the\r\nchill. Fever quickly follows; the pulse runs up from 110 to 130 in a\r\nfew hours; the temperature reaches from 103.5° to 106° by the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours; the pains increase, and there are insomnia and\r\ngreat restlessness; appetite fails; thirst is extreme; the tongue is\r\nmoist and furred, and the bowels quiet. During the subsequent six days\r\nthese symptoms persist. The temperature presents a daily remission at\r\nsome period of the twenty-four hours amounting to one or two degrees,\r\nthe maximum reached in fully-developed cases varying from 104° to\r\n108°. The pulse continues very rapid, and not rarely exceeds 140; the\r\nrespirations are hurried and rapid, and cough attends many cases.\r\nDelirium is rare, but insomnia, restlessness, headache, and rheumatic\r\npains in the back and limbs may prove constantly annoying. Appetite is\r\nvariable, more frequently lost; nausea and vomiting are common; thirst\r\nis very troublesome; and the bowels are constipated or loose. No\r\ncharacteristic eruption appears, but sudamina are frequently present,\r\nsince in a large proportion of cases there is more or less sweating,\r\neven during the continuance of high fever. Abdominal pain, tenderness\r\nin the epigastrium and hypochondria, and demonstrable enlargement of\r\nthe liver and spleen are almost invariable. The urine is concentrated\r\nand dark or bile-stained. Jaundice is a common symptom, though its\r\nfrequency varies greatly in different epidemics. The same may be said\r\nof epistaxis.\r\n\r\nWhile these symptoms are at their height and the patient is suffering\r\nseverely the paroxysm suddenly ceases, and in a few hours he is\r\nentirely relieved. This remarkable crisis occurs usually at the close\r\nof the seventh day, but may occur as early as the third or as late as\r\nthe fifteenth day. It is attended with a critical discharge, copious\r\nsweating being by far the most common, though diarrhoea, free\r\nepistaxis, or hemorrhage from some other surface may replace it. The\r\npatient feels weak and languid; the temperature and pulse have fallen\r\nbelow the normal, and remain so for a day or two. Soon there is a\r\nrapid improvement in the appetite and the appearance of the tongue,\r\nand the patient regains strength day by day, and often feels so well\r\nthat it is difficult to persuade him that he must avoid exertion and\r\nexposure. The enlargement of the spleen subsides rapidly, that of the\r\nliver more gradually; epigastric tenderness subsides, but in many\r\ncases some degree of it persists for several days. This interval or\r\napyretic period lasts about a week, when, again without warning or\r\nprovocation, the patient relapses, and is seized abruptly with the\r\nsame set of symptoms which attended the first attack. This relapse\r\ndoes not usually last more than three days (one to five are the\r\nlimits), and is terminated by a similar crisis, after which a slow\r\nconvalescence is entered upon, or else after an apyretic interval of\r\nsome days' duration a second relapse ensues, and this may, in rare\r\ncases, be in turn followed by a third, fourth, fifth, or even sixth\r\nsimilar relapse. In addition, it must be noted that many serious\r\ncomplications are liable to occur. The total duration of the disease\r\nthus varies from eighteen to ninety days. Convalescence is often\r\ntedious, and there are many troublesome sequelæ. {376} The mortality,\r\nhowever, is not great, averaging 5 or 6 per cent. Death may occur\r\nsuddenly from collapse at the close of the first paroxysm or from\r\nheart-clot; it may be produced by exhaustion in protracted cases; or\r\nbe hastened by any serious complication; or the patient may sink into\r\na typhoid condition, with low delirium, coma, and suppression of urine\r\nfor several days before the fatal termination.\r\n\r\nDETAILED STUDY OF SPECIAL CONDITIONS.--It is usually difficult to\r\ndetermine the period of incubation. In the unique case in which\r\nMotschutkoffsky is said to have produced relapsing fever by\r\ninoculation the initial symptoms occurred seven days after the\r\ninoculation. Wyss and Bock had several good opportunities of\r\ndetermining the minimum period of incubation, and found it to be six\r\ndays. We may assume that the ordinary period is six to eight days, but\r\nthat it varies, in accordance with the virulence of the virus or the\r\nsusceptibility of the system, from four to fourteen days. During this\r\ntime the patient feels as well as usual, or at most suffers for a day\r\nor two from slight malaise, with vague rheumatoid pains, headache,\r\ngiddiness, and anorexia. In only 13 out of 181 of our cases in which\r\nthis point is noted was the invasion gradual. Examination of the blood\r\nprior to the invasion does not discover any spirilla.\r\n\r\nThe invasion is usually abrupt and during the daytime; the patient can\r\noften fix the very hour of its occurrence, a severe chill attacking\r\nhim while at work or at meal-time. This is the most common initial\r\nsymptom (138 out of 168 our cases of sudden invasion); less commonly,\r\nobstinate vomiting and nausea or sudden vertigo are the first symptoms\r\n(each 8 times out of 168), or violent headache (14 times out of 168),\r\nor sharp epigastric pain. Parry also observed that the occurrence of\r\nobstinate and profuse vomiting as the initial symptom was especially\r\nfrequent in children.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomy is carefully noted in one hundred and seventy of our\r\nrecords. The countenance is often flushed, with watery eyes and\r\nanxious, suffering expression. The flush is less dingy and dull than\r\nin typhus; the eye is comparatively rarely injected; and the\r\nexpression is much less dull and stupid than in that disease. In cases\r\nwhere grave nervous symptoms supervene and the typhoid condition is\r\ndeveloped the facies assumes all the characteristics of that state.\r\n\r\nThe livid bronzing of the face, described by Cormack in 1843 and by\r\nCarter (Bombay epidemic of 1877), was noticed in a moderate degree in\r\nonly nine of our cases, and seems to be of infrequent occurrence. When\r\nwe observed it it seemed due to an admixture of a faint jaundice tinge\r\nwith a deep flush. Jaundice, as already stated, is of common\r\noccurrence, though its frequency varies greatly in different\r\nepidemics. It was present in 25 per cent. of our cases, rather more\r\nfrequently in the negro patients than in whites, and in degree varied\r\nfrom a slight tinge of the conjunctiva and skin to the deepest\r\nstaining of the entire body. The presence of jaundice in combination\r\nwith the general features of high fever imparts a most peculiar and\r\nalarming appearance to such patients.\r\n\r\nWith the occurrence of the crisis the flush rapidly subsides and the\r\nface becomes pale, or, if the discharges have been profuse, it may\r\nappear sunken, haggard, and almost choleraic. Parry described a\r\npeculiar puffed, velvety look at this stage, as though the skin had\r\nbeen much thickened and softened at the same time.\r\n\r\n{377} There is no characteristic eruption in relapsing fever. In 150\r\nout of 180 cases where the condition of the skin was carefully noted\r\nthere was no eruption of any kind; in 4 cases there were small\r\nroseolar spots, with peculiar subcuticular mottling, which resembled\r\nthe early stages of typhus eruption, but soon faded away without\r\nbecoming petechial. A similar eruption was noticed by Murchison in 8\r\nout of 600 cases. It appears from the third to the seventh day of the\r\nfirst paroxysm; it may or may not recur in the relapse, or it may\r\noccur then only. Eruptions apparently similar to this have been\r\ndescribed by others as quite common in certain epidemics. Carter\r\ndescribes minutely an eruption which was noted in at least 10 per\r\ncent. of his Bombay cases, the spots of which were at first small,\r\nslightly raised, and pinkish or rose-colored, and which either faded\r\naway soon or changed into purplish, more persistent stains. In a\r\nvaluable report on the Königsberg epidemic of 1879-80, Meschede[10]\r\nremarks that roseola was observed in cases complicated by exanthematic\r\ntyphus, which prevailed simultaneously, but in no case of\r\nuncomplicated relapsing fever. While, however, this suggestion may\r\napply to some few of the cases of eruption observed by others, it is\r\ncertainly inapplicable to the vast majority of them. We also noticed\r\nan eruption of pale-reddish, slightly elevated papules in seven cases.\r\nIt must be borne in mind that persons of such a low class as are the\r\ngreat majority of relapsing-fever patients would naturally be expected\r\nto present a variety of cutaneous eruptions from filth or vermin, and\r\nthat in consequence some of the appearances above described may have\r\nbeen of such origin. It is certain that the bites of either\r\nmosquitoes, fleas, or bedbugs may in this disease be followed by\r\npersistent reddish papules passing into petechiæ. Apart from this,\r\nhowever, true petechiæ have been quite common in some epidemics, while\r\nvery rare in others. Parry saw \"small spots of purpura\" once only, in\r\na delicate girl; and we did not observe petechiæ once in several\r\nhundred cases, many of which had extensive internal ecchymoses. On the\r\nother hand, they have been found in as much as 30 per cent. of all\r\ncases (314 out of 1000 cases, Smith at Glasgow). They do not appear on\r\nany fixed day, but are more common in the first paroxysm than in the\r\nrelapses; and although sometimes associated with a tendency to\r\nhemorrhages from other surfaces, they have been so often observed in\r\ncases of ordinary severity that scarce any unfavorable prognostic\r\nvalue can be attached to them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Virchow's Arch._, Bd. lxxxvii., p. 405.]\r\n\r\nVibices and extensive ecchymoses of the surface are of much more grave\r\nimport, and in cases where fatal sinking is threatened they may appear\r\naccompanying a purplish lividity of the countenance.\r\n\r\nHerpetic eruptions about the mouth or nostrils were observed in 20 out\r\nof 181 of our cases in which this point is noted. They appeared\r\nusually toward the close of the febrile stage, and their development\r\nwas found to have value in determining the approach of the crisis.\r\nBärensprung mentions especially the occurrence of herpes labialis in\r\ncases of irregular relapsing fever which bore considerable resemblance\r\nto typhus. Sudamina are, as might be expected in a disease attended\r\nwith so much sweating, of quite common occurrence, though much more so\r\nin some epidemics than in others, unless searched for with greater\r\ncare by the one set of observers. Desquamation was noted in 42 out of\r\n181 of our cases, and {378} invariably at the close of the relapse. It\r\nwas usually confined to the hands and face, and occurred in the form\r\nof comparatively small flakes. This is more frequent than has been the\r\ncase in most epidemics. Murchison quotes a case in which a piece of\r\nepidermis ten inches square separated from the body of a lad\r\nconvalescent from relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nA peculiar odor exhaling from patients with relapsing fever has been\r\nrepeatedly noticed. A description of this unpleasant symptom, given by\r\nKelly, as quoted by Murchison,[11] accords closely with what was\r\nfrequently manifest in our own cases: \"The smell was peculiar, not\r\nfetid or heavy, but somewhat like burning straw with a musty odor.\"\r\nCarter, in describing a similar odor in some of his cases, notes that\r\nthe skin was not in these instances in a particularly foul state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Op. cit._, p. 346.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said, it will be anticipated that the\r\nvariations of the temperature in relapsing fever constitute the most\r\npeculiar and characteristic feature of that disease. A careful study\r\nof the accompanying charts will convey a more accurate impression than\r\ncan be given by any description. The temperature begins to rise before\r\nthe chill is fully developed, and when there is no initial chill the\r\npatient may be found within a few hours of the appearance of giddiness\r\nand headache with a temperature of 102.5° to 103.5°. Before\r\ntwenty-four hours have passed it has risen to from 104° to 106°.\r\nDuring the paroxysm the febrile movement is continued, presenting\r\nmerely a diurnal variation of one to two degrees, sometimes attended\r\nwith sweating and partial relief of distressing symptoms, the minimum\r\nbeing observed at different hours in different cases, or even in the\r\nsame case, though more frequently it occurs in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn a case reported by Parry a chill recurred at the same morning hour\r\non three successive days. Wyss and Bock report some unusual cases in\r\nwhich a brief intermission occurred, with a fall of pulse and\r\ntemperature to the normal, most frequently on the day before the real\r\ntermination of the paroxysm. The highest temperature varies from\r\n104.5° to 108.75°; in our cases the highest observed was 107.5°. This\r\noccurs, as a rule, on the last day or the day before the last of the\r\ninitial paroxysm, and Obermeier has observed a sudden rise of four\r\ndegrees in half an hour just before the crisis. Meschede,[12] however,\r\nfound the highest temperature on the corresponding days of the first\r\nrelapse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the primary paroxysm is usually six or seven days; but\r\nthis is subject to considerable variations, as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing table of 160 cases in which the duration was accurately\r\nascertained: Initial paroxysm lasted--2 days in 1 case; 3 days in 2\r\ncases; 4 days in 10 cases; 5 days in 19 cases; 6 days in 40 cases; 7\r\ndays in 58 cases; 8 days in 18 cases; 9 days in 2 cases; 10 days in 5\r\ncases; 11 days in 2 cases; 14 days in 2 cases; 15 days in 1 case; and\r\nParry, observing the same epidemic, found the duration of the first\r\nparoxysm to vary from 4 to 11 days. It is, however, rare for the\r\nduration to exceed ten days unless some complication be present.\r\n\r\n{379} [Illustration: FIG. 20. Typical case of relapsing fever, with\r\nthree relapses, terminating in recovery. (From Motschutkoffsky)]\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the crisis there is a prodigious and sudden fall\r\nof temperature, unequalled in any other condition of disease. Within a\r\nfew hours it may fall six or eight degrees (going down at the rate of\r\n1.5° or 2° an hour); and falls of 12°, 13°, or even 14.4° (Murchison),\r\nin the course of twelve hours have been noted. In our own cases the\r\ngreatest {380} fall was from 107.2° to 95°, or 12.2°; and this is as\r\nlow a point as is usually reached, though temperatures of 94°, 93°, or\r\neven 92°, have repeatedly been observed. Murchison refers to one case\r\nin which collapse supervened, where the rectal temperature was 90.6°.\r\nIn nearly all of our cases a subnormal temperature occurred at the\r\ncrisis, and lasted for a day or two subsequently, when it gradually\r\nrose and remained normal until the relapse, unless some transient\r\ncomplication caused a temporary rise in the interval.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Typical case of relapsing fever (Mary Collins,\r\naged 32), terminating in recovery. One relapse, with slight\r\npost-critical rise of temperature.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, there is no relapse whatever, but convalescence follows\r\n{381} the initial paroxysm. This occurred in 10 out of 181 of our\r\ncases, and Murchison found that of 2425 cases reported by various\r\nauthors no relapses occurred in about 30 per cent. Carter describes\r\nthese under the name of the abortive form, and found them to\r\nconstitute 23.8 per cent. of all his cases. It is probable, however,\r\nthat in many cases so regarded either a relapse of very transient\r\nduration has been overlooked, or else that an attack of ephemeral\r\nfever has been regarded as of specific nature. In ordinary cases the\r\nduration of the intermission averages six or seven days, but here,\r\nagain, considerable variation occurs. In 139 of our cases where its\r\nduration could be accurately determined it was as follows:\r\n\r\n   3 days in  4 cases.    7 days in 64 cases.   11 days in 1 case.\r\n   4  \"   \"   3  \"        8  \"   \"  22  \"       12  \"   \"  1  \"\r\n   5  \"   \"  12  \"        9  \"   \"   9  \"       13  \"   \"  1  \"\r\n   6  \"   \"  12  \"       10  \"   \"   9  \"       20  \"   \"  1  \"\r\n\r\nDespite these variations in the duration of the initial paroxysm and\r\nof the first intermission, the average date of the occurrence of the\r\nrelapse in any large series of cases is about the twelfth day from the\r\nprimary chill.\r\n\r\nThe relapse is ushered in with the same striking abruptness as the\r\ninitial attack. The temperature again rises rapidly to 104° or 106°,\r\nand then pursues a continuous course resembling ordinarily that of the\r\nprimary paroxysm. The difference between the maximum of the two\r\nparoxysms is rarely more than 1.5° or 2°, though either may be much\r\nmilder than the other; as a rule, the highest temperature is attained\r\non the last or penultimate day of the first attack. The duration of\r\nthe relapse averages three or four days, though it may last but a few\r\nhours or a single day, and yet exhibit a rise of 5°, 6°, or 7°; or, on\r\nthe other hand, it may be prolonged to six, seven, or even more days.\r\nLyons, observing the disease in the Crimea, reports some relapses as\r\nhaving lasted twenty-one days, though it is improbable that a greater\r\nduration than seven days occurs without the presence of some\r\ncomplication. The relapse usually terminates by crisis, with an abrupt\r\nfall to an abnormally low temperature; though we observed at this\r\ntime, much more frequently than at the close of the first paroxysm, a\r\ngradual subsidence of fever, or lysis. Again the patient regains\r\nstrength and appetite, but in a considerable proportion of cases\r\nsubsequent relapses ensue. As a rule, the second, third, and later\r\nrelapses are attended with a febrile movement of shorter duration and\r\nof less severity than the first two paroxysms, and are also separated\r\nby intermissions of increasing length. Meschede[13] found from a study\r\nof 360 cases that the average duration was for the first paroxysm six\r\nor seven days; second paroxysm, four or five days; third paroxysm,\r\nthree or four days; fourth paroxysm, one or two days; fifth paroxysm,\r\none day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable case given in full at page 394, the duration of the\r\nparoxysms and intermissions were as follows:\r\n\r\n  First paroxysm, 8 days; first intermission, 9 days.\r\n  Second     \"    5  \"    second      \"       1  \"\r\n  Third      \"    1  \"    third       \"       6  \"\r\n  Fourth     \"    6  \"    fourth      \"       8  \"\r\n  Fifth      \"    5  \"    fifth       \"       9  \"\r\n  Sixth      \"    4  \"    sixth       \"      10  \"\r\n  Seventh    \"    3  \"    seventh     \"      11  \"\r\n  Eighth     \"    3  \"    followed by convalescence.\r\n\r\n{382} The proportion of cases in which more than a single relapse\r\noccurs appears to vary in different epidemics. Murchison found that in\r\n1500 cases reported by various authors a second relapse occurred 109\r\ntimes (1 out of 14); a third relapse, 9 times (1 out of 166); and a\r\nfourth relapse, once. Of 182 cases noted carefully by ourselves, a\r\nsecond relapse occurred 24 times (1 out of 7-1/2); a third relapse, 5\r\ntimes (1 out of 36); a fourth relapse, once; and in the\r\nabove-mentioned case six or seven relapses.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the total duration of the morbid process varies from\r\nthe average of about eighteen or twenty days, in cases with a single\r\nrelapse, to forty, sixty, or even ninety days. Of course the\r\noccurrence of complications may lead to very great modifications of\r\nthe febrile movement and of the total duration of the disease.\r\n\r\nThere are several additional points about the febrile process\r\nrequiring mention. In all the paroxysms there is a greater tendency to\r\nlocal or general perspirations than is met with in other continued\r\nfevers, and occasionally there are rigors or slight chills about the\r\nsame hour on several days after the invasion or on the day preceding\r\nthe crisis. It has been noted also that, even when the temperature is\r\nvery high, the quality of the heat, as judged by the feeling of the\r\nskin, is different from that in typhus fever, and that the peculiar\r\npungent irritating sensation known as calor mordax is rarely marked.\r\nBut a more important peculiarity is the fact that the extreme\r\ntemperatures (106°, 107°, or 108°) that are frequently observed in\r\nrelapsing fever for several days in succession do not appear to\r\ninvolve any great increase of danger, and in particular are not\r\nattended with the production of the grave nervous symptoms so often\r\nmet with in connection with hyperpyrexia in typhus and typhoid, and\r\noften regarded as the direct result of the exalted temperature itself.\r\nThis striking fact is of much interest in its bearing on the theory of\r\nhyperpyrexia, and may possibly be explained by some marked difference\r\nin the conditions of heat-dispersion in these different diseases.\r\n\r\nThe pulse in relapsing fever is very rapid, and on the whole the rate\r\ncorresponds with the movement of the temperature. It usually rises\r\nabove 110, the limits being 90 and 140, the lower rate being noticed\r\nin the milder and uncomplicated cases and in subjects of phlegmatic\r\nconstitution. The pulse rises rapidly at the invasion, and may reach\r\n120 in the course of a few hours. Its maximum is usually noticed when\r\nthe temperature is highest, shortly before the crisis; and when this\r\nactually begins the pulse may fall with a rapidity as remarkable as\r\nthat of the decline of the temperature. Thus, within twenty-four hours\r\nit may fall from 152 to 80, or in even a shorter time from 140 to 54,\r\nor even as low as 48 (Obermeier) or 44 (Muirheid), or even 30\r\n(Stillé). While this great fall is often noted, it is by no means\r\nconstant. In our own cases it was frequently observed that the\r\ncritical fall in temperature was not accompanied by a commensurate\r\nfall in pulse. Thus, at the close of a very severe initial paroxysm\r\nlasting nine days the temperature was 107°, and fell in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours to 99°, and in twenty-four hours more to 96°; during\r\nthe first day of this fall the pulse was from 96 to 100, and during\r\nthe second it fell to 76.\r\n\r\nThis want of correspondence was more marked at the close of the {383}\r\nrelapse than of the primary attack; thus, in a well-marked case, where\r\nthe maximum temperature (105.4°) occurred eighteen hours before the\r\ncrisis of relapse, the temperature fell in four hours from 104.4° to\r\n96.2°, while the pulse, which was 130, fell in twelve hours to 108,\r\nand in twelve more to 92. In another case, in a man aged twenty, the\r\ntemperature at the close of the second relapse was 106.4°, with a\r\npulse of only 100; after the crisis, as the temperature fell, the\r\npulse rose to 120, and did not descend until the end of twenty-four\r\nhours; and later, at the close of thirty-six hours, the temperature\r\nwas 98° and the pulse 72, lower than which it did not go. Carter[14]\r\nstates that in the Bombay epidemic it was invariably the case that the\r\npulse did not decline to an extent corresponding with the temperature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Op. cit._, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the intermission the pulse may be normal, or\r\nit may continue accelerated in consequence of some irritative\r\ncondition; as the time for the relapse approaches it frequently again\r\nbecomes abnormally slow. In either event it is found that any muscular\r\nexertion causes marked acceleration of the pulse.\r\n\r\nDuring the paroxysm the character of the pulse is full and bounding,\r\nand there is considerable arterial tension. This is well shown in some\r\nof the sphygmographic tracings by Carter;[15] while in one of our\r\ntracings from the right radial of a man æt. 32, taken on the fourth\r\nday of a severe initial paroxysm, the line of ascent is steep and the\r\nsummit sharp. During the crisis, and for a day or two thereafter, the\r\npulse may be weak, compressible, and dicrotic, and occasionally\r\nirregular.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Op. cit._, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nThe sounds of the heart and its impulse are weakened, except possibly\r\nduring the first few days of the primary paroxysm. Blood-murmurs over\r\nthe base of the heart and along the great vessels in relapsing fever\r\nwere first noticed by Stokes, and have been frequently observed in\r\nsubsequent epidemics. They were found in a large proportion of our\r\ncases, not rarely in both paroxysms, and during the early stage of\r\nconvalescence when anæmia was marked; but during the intermissions\r\nthey are rarely audible, and when the action of the heart was slow\r\nthey were replaced by prolongation of the first sound.\r\n\r\nIt must be further noted that the pulse-rate is not a reliable\r\nindication of the danger in this disease, since, just as is the case\r\nwith the hyperpyrexia, extreme rapidity of pulse may be present when\r\nthe general symptoms denote no unusual danger, and when the patient\r\nultimately recovers most satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable disproportion and dissimilarity between the\r\ncerebral and peripheral nervous phenomena in relapsing fever and those\r\nfamiliar to us in typhus and typhoid fevers. We have seen that\r\npatients almost invariably complain of headache. When prodromes are\r\npresent it is commonly among them, and it may be the initial symptom\r\nto usher in each paroxysm. When the attack is fully developed headache\r\nis usually very severe, and no symptom is more bitterly complained of.\r\nIt varies in seat and character. More commonly it is frontal or\r\ngeneral; occasionally we found it occipital, and still more rarely it\r\nwas unilateral, constituting hemicrania. It rarely continues during\r\nthe relapse. Headache of an equally acute and violent character may be\r\npresent in typhoid, but the headache of typhus is much more dull and\r\ncontusive.\r\n\r\n{384} The mental condition is only exceptionally affected, a\r\ncircumstance which greatly increases the patient's perception of his\r\nsufferings. Delirium is not present in ordinary cases, even though\r\nvery severe and attended with hyperpyrexia; or if present is limited\r\nto the period immediately preceding the crisis, when there may be\r\nviolent and noisy delirium of transient character. In some of our\r\ncases forcible restraint was necessary under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous instances on record showing the abruptness with\r\nwhich noisy, demonstrative, or even destructive delirium may appear,\r\nand the equal suddenness with which in the course of a few hours, or\r\neven of fifteen minutes, the patient may become rational and composed.\r\nSuch attacks resemble hysteroidal spells, and probably occur more\r\nreadily in patients of a nervous or hysterical temperament. They were\r\ncertainly more common when the patients had been of intemperate\r\nhabits; and, further, we had opportunities of noting that the\r\noccurrence of relapses in habitual drunkards who had previously\r\nsuffered with delirium tremens was apt to develop a form of delirium\r\nwhich was to all appearance of that nature.\r\n\r\nDelirium of a different and much more grave type may appear in\r\nconnection with the symptoms of the typhoid state. In some cases this\r\nresults from the presence of serious complications which induce a\r\nstate of great prostration, while in others it is associated with\r\ngreat diminution or entire suppression of urine. The delirium under\r\nthese circumstances is apt to be low and muttering, with a tendency to\r\npass into stupor or profound coma.\r\n\r\nVertigo is present more frequently and in a more persistent form than\r\nin any other febrile disease. It was noticed as among the occasional\r\nprodromes, and was especially severe for the first few days of the\r\ninitial paroxysm, though it often continued throughout this stage and\r\nrecurred with the relapse. Occasionally it was complained of in the\r\nrecumbent position, but usually it was excited only by a change of\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWakefulness was one of the most distressing symptoms in all cases, and\r\nappears to have been noted in all epidemics. Although the severity of\r\nthe pain in various parts of the body and the absence of blunting of\r\nthe perceptions would naturally cause much loss of sleep, the degree\r\nof the insomnia and the obstinate resistance it offers to the action\r\nof anodynes are apparently far in excess of what could thus be\r\naccounted for. Parry found that several of his patients could take as\r\nmuch as three grains of opium every second hour throughout the\r\nafternoon and night without either inducing sleep or causing\r\ncontraction of the pupils.\r\n\r\nConvulsions are rare and of very grave import. They may occur at the\r\nperiod just preceding crisis, when the nervous irritation is most\r\nintense, and are then somewhat less indicative of a fatal result than\r\nif occurring in the course of the paroxysm, when they are apt to be\r\nassociated with extreme prostration of the nervous centres, with a\r\ntendency to subsequent fatal coma. No connection has been observed\r\nbetween their occurrence and the presence of albumen in the urine.\r\n\r\nGeneral tremor is rare, and was observed only in those of our cases\r\nwhere there had been habitual intemperance, with presumably a tendency\r\nto delirium tremens. Muscular rigidity was noticed occasionally, but\r\nmay have been only apparent, being induced by the hyperæsthesia and\r\n{385} soreness which were marked in some cases. The hyperæsthesia\r\nwhich was observed was both cutaneous and muscular, and was attended\r\nwith tenderness of the body of the muscle, and also of the nerve-trunk\r\nsupplying it. Meschede speaks of opisthotonos as a rare complication\r\nin his cases.\r\n\r\nMotor paralysis involving single muscles or groups of muscles is\r\noccasionally noticed, as of the deltoid or of one arm (Meschede).\r\nParry observed transient loss of power of the extremities in several\r\ncases, chiefly during the intermission or the period of convalescence.\r\nIn one of our cases temporary hemiplegia occurred, with partial loss\r\nof sensation on the affected side.\r\n\r\nThe bladder and rectum are rarely affected, except in cases where the\r\ntyphoid state with tendency to coma is present. Disorders of sensation\r\nare, however, much more common. When motor palsy occurs the affected\r\npart may also be the seat of impaired sensibility, while in a large\r\nproportion of all cases numbness of the extremities, with or without a\r\nsense of tingling, is complained of; out of 182 cases we noted this\r\nsymptom in 94, affecting the fingers alone in 62, the feet alone in 6,\r\nand all the extremities in 25 cases. Cutaneous hyperæsthesia or\r\npartial anæsthesia are also occasionally observed. But the most\r\nnoteworthy and constant symptom of this class are the pains in the\r\nmuscles and joints which are bitterly complained of by nearly all\r\npatients with relapsing fever. They constitute, indeed, one of the\r\nhighly characteristic features of the disease, and possess a\r\ndiagnostic value. They may occur among the rarely present prodromes,\r\nbut usually they appear with the chill and increase in intensity\r\nduring the paroxysm; they may persist with even greater severity\r\nduring the intermission, or, if they have then subsided, recur with\r\nthe relapse, and may constitute one of the most troublesome hindrances\r\nto convalescence. It will thus be seen that in frequency, severity,\r\nand persistency they differ widely from the aching pains in the\r\nextremities complained of in typhus and other specific fevers. They\r\nare one of the most potent causes of the extreme insomnia, and are apt\r\nto dwell in the mind of the patient so vividly that he dreads each\r\nrelapse on this account, and consequently looks back upon his attack\r\nof relapsing fever as a terribly painful experience. These pains are\r\nusually described as rheumatic in character, and several times\r\npatients presenting themselves at the hospital on the second or third\r\nday of the initial paroxysm stated that they had inflammatory\r\nrheumatism. As a fact, we observed the utmost intensity of these pains\r\nin a few cases where the patients were of marked rheumatic diathesis.\r\nThe nape of the neck, the muscles of the trunk or extremities, or the\r\nlarge or small joints, or lower parts of the spinal region, may be the\r\nseat. At times they extend along the course of nerve-trunks. In\r\ncharacter they are described as a deep intense aching, with occasional\r\nsevere or excruciating, sharp, lancinating pains. Pressure or movement\r\nincreases them. The joints are not red or swollen (though swelling may\r\nappear as a sequel), and the pains seemed to us rather to be referred\r\nto the joints than to be caused by any local irritation therein. As\r\nalready stated, there is often tenderness of the body of the muscles,\r\nand this was especially marked in many of our cases on pressure along\r\nthe course of the nerve-trunk.\r\n\r\nMurchison suggests that they are due to the circulation in the blood\r\nof an {386} abnormal substance, such as uric, lactic, or phosphoric\r\nacid; but it appears to us altogether probable that they are rather to\r\nbe connected with states of congestive irritation of the sheaths of\r\nthe nerve-trunks (early stage of perineuritis), or possibly in some\r\ncases of the spinal membranes also. It is true that they are sometimes\r\nshifting in their seat and fluctuating in their severity, but this is\r\nnot inconsistent with the above suggestion, while the widespread\r\nirritative processes found in this remarkable disease, the resemblance\r\nof these pains and the frequently attendant numbness and tingling to\r\nthe sensations caused by other forms of perineuritis, and the\r\noccasional development of local palsies of a single muscle or group of\r\nmuscles, all are in its support.\r\n\r\nThe special senses are acute, sometimes painfully so. The eyes are\r\nwatery and occasionally injected, but this latter condition is rare\r\nand slight in relapsing as compared with typhus fever. At the crisis\r\nand for a few days subsequently wide dilatation of the pupils is not\r\ninfrequently observed. Dulness of hearing was present during the\r\nparoxysm in 14 of our cases, and a few patients complained of\r\ntinnitus; but these symptoms are not at all common in the disease,\r\nalthough it will be seen hereafter that affections of the middle ear\r\nare among its sequelæ.\r\n\r\nDebility is not such a prominent symptom as in typhus and typhoid\r\nfevers. Patients manage to drag themselves about for several days\r\nduring the initial paroxysm with all the symptoms fully developed, and\r\nafter admission to the hospital will often be able to help themselves,\r\nor even to rise from bed, unless prevented by the severe pains or the\r\nvertigo. Still, there are many cases, not necessarily of very grave\r\ntype, in which there is a marked sense of weariness and exhaustion,\r\nand of course in all cases of typhoid character the prostration is\r\ngreat. It must constantly be borne in mind that even when the patient\r\nfeels or seems able to sit up he must on no account be permitted to do\r\nso, since the occurrence of sudden and fatal syncope is one of the\r\naccidents constantly to be apprehended. It is not only during the\r\npyrexia that this precaution must be enforced; we meet with extreme\r\ndebility during the intermission in some cases, and syncope has\r\nfollowed exertions made at that period as well as at others.\r\n\r\nDuring the paroxysms the respirations are much accelerated, at times\r\nto a greater degree than would correspond with the pulse-rate, while\r\nat others extreme rapidity of pulse may be associated with moderate\r\nelevation of the rate of respirations.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the relation between temperature, pulse, and\r\nrespirations we quote the following from our records of adult cases:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Temperature, 108°; pulse, 124; respiration, 40. In the relapse;\r\nno chest trouble.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Temperature, 107.5°; pulse, 120; respiration, 28; falling to\r\ntemperature, 96°; pulse, 68; respiration, 18, within twelve hours,\r\nduring which crisis occurred.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Temperature, 107°; pulse, 144; respiration, 31. In the relapse.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Temperature, 107°; pulse, 108; respiration, 44. Initial\r\nparoxysm; no pulmonary congestion.\r\n\r\nTemperature, 106°; pulse, 116; respiration, 28. Relapse; no pulmonary\r\ncongestion.\r\n\r\nTemperature, 97°; pulse, 76; respiration, 24. Critical fall; cough,\r\n{387} congestion of lungs posteriorly, and left one relatively dull on\r\npercussion, but pneumonia did not develop.\r\n\r\nIn many epidemics bronchitis, hypostatic congestion, and pneumonia are\r\nof rare occurrence, while in others, as in Philadelphia in 1870, they\r\nare comparatively frequent and lead to serious respiratory symptoms.\r\nWhile the pyrexia was high there was very frequently an irritative dry\r\ncough, with the fine crepitant and subcrepitant râles attending\r\ncongestion and imperfect expansion of the lungs heard at the middle\r\nand lower portions of the chest posteriorly. In numerous instances the\r\nrâles would disappear entirely after a few full inspirations in the\r\nsitting posture, just as in the corresponding condition in typhoid\r\nfever. But in a considerable proportion of all the cases (fully 35 per\r\ncent.) there was more troublesome bronchial cough, associated with\r\nsonorous, sibilant and subcrepitant râles, with mucous or\r\nmuco-purulent expectoration.\r\n\r\nBronchitis of this character was a source of serious annoyance to many\r\npatients. In several cases there was impaired resonance at the lower\r\nmargins of the lungs posteriorly, with imperfect bronchial\r\nrespiration, but without the symptoms of fully-developed pneumonia.\r\nSuch conditions were regarded as due to hypostatic congestion, and\r\nproved amenable to treatment. Pneumonia occurred in eleven cases out\r\nof 200 recorded with reference to this complication. It will be more\r\nfully discussed under the head of Complications. It was attended with\r\nthe usual physical signs, and gave rise to extremely rapid and labored\r\nbreathing, especially when associated with painful enlargement of the\r\nliver and spleen. In a case of double pneumonia, with enlarged and\r\nruptured spleen, the respirations were from 80 to 90 for two days, the\r\npulse being 130 to 136. It was a very fatal complication, death\r\nresulting in all but two instances.\r\n\r\nLeyden[16] has shown that though the percentage of carbonic acid in\r\nthe air expired during the pyrexia is diminished, the total quantity\r\nexhaled is increased, the proportion being as 1.5 to 1 in the\r\nnon-febrile state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: \"U. d. Resp. in Fieber,\" _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._,\r\n1870, 536, quoted by Murchison.]\r\n\r\nElaborate investigations have been made of the condition of the urine\r\nin relapsing fever by numerous observers, and in the Philadelphia\r\nepidemic of 1870 we had the great advantage of being assisted by the\r\ndistinguished chemist, the late Horace B. Hare, who conducted an\r\nextensive series of analyses in our cases. In a number of cases\r\nquantitative analyses were continued daily throughout the entire\r\ncourse of the disease.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the quantity of the urine is comparatively free during the\r\nfebrile periods, very scanty at the time of crisis, except in the\r\ncases where critical discharges of urine occur, and excessive for some\r\ndays after the crisis.\r\n\r\nStill, there were not rare exceptions, especially to the first of\r\nthese statements. Thus on four successive days of the relapse of a\r\nsevere case with delirium, but without albumen, and which ultimately\r\nrecovered, the analysis gave--\r\n\r\n  Temperature.  Amount in ccm.  Sp. gr.  Urea in Grm.  Na. Cl.\r\n      103            400         1024       23.8        2.64\r\n      105            300         1025       15.27       1.95\r\n      106            500         1024       24.7        4.3\r\n   106 to 97         850         1021       24.735      5.525\r\n\r\n{388} And in another severe case, also resulting in recovery, the\r\nanalysis was, for two days preceding the crisis of the initial\r\nparoxysm--\r\n\r\n  Amount.

The largest amounts we noted were in a man who recovered, and\r\nwho passed at the crisis of the relapse and during the following days\r\nthe amounts here given.\r\n\r\n   Amount.   Sp. gr.

The rule appears to be that it\r\nincreases during the paroxysms, diminishes during the crisis,\r\nincreases during the few days following crisis, and then falls off\r\nagain. These results are stated upon the authority of Murchison,\r\nquoting from Pribram and Robitschek, Wyss and Bock, and others. Our\r\nown observations, however, while agreeing in the main with these, show\r\nthat there are numerous and important exceptions, especially to the\r\noccurrence of the post-febrile increase in the elimination of urea.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of urea excreted in twenty-four hours by any of our\r\npatients was 59.13 grammes, or 912 grains, on the sixth day after the\r\nend of the relapse, but as much as 74 grammes (1142 grains) have been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nDeposits of urates were very common in the urine of the paroxysms and\r\nof the crisis. The uric acid has been found increased, and so also\r\nhave the phosphates, crystals of which are frequently found mixed with\r\nthe urates.\r\n\r\nThe chlorides diminish during the paroxysms, until just before the\r\ncrisis their amount is very small, or they may even have disappeared.\r\nImmediately after the crisis they reappear slowly or quickly, and even\r\n{389} very large amounts may be discharged, as seen in the figures\r\ngiven by Hare's analyses: 2.6 grm. on day of crisis, 42.8 grm. the\r\nfollowing day, and the enormous amount of 130.995 grm. on the next\r\nday. A copious flow of urine corresponds with great augmentation in\r\nthe amount of the chlorides.\r\n\r\nBile-pigment was constantly present in jaundiced cases, the amount\r\nbeing proportioned to the depth of the jaundice and the quantity of\r\nthe urine. Bile-acids have been detected (Carter and Schmidt), and\r\nalso leucin and tyrosin (Pribram and Robitschek).\r\n\r\nAlbumen, with or without tube-casts, is not uncommonly found, and\r\ntraces of sugar have been detected in a few cases. More careful\r\nconsideration will be given to these under the head of Complications.\r\n\r\nThe following appearance of the tongue has been repeatedly described,\r\nand when present may be regarded as possessing some diagnostic value:\r\nThe body of the tongue slightly swollen, so as to show the impressions\r\nof the teeth, and by the second day the central part of the dorsum\r\ncovered with a peculiarly white fur, while the edges and a small\r\ntriangular space at the tip are clean and red. Such a tongue was seen\r\nin many cases at the beginning of the Philadelphia epidemic, but later\r\nit was present in but a small proportion. We find it specially\r\nmentioned in 97 of our recorded cases, or about 50 per cent., the\r\ngeneral description being given that it was moist, rather large, with\r\npink, clear edges, and a triangular clear space at the tip, and with\r\nheavy white fur in the centre.\r\n\r\nSome accurate observers, as Wyss and Bock, did not notice anything\r\npeculiar about the tongue, but merely described it as moist and coated\r\nwith a thick white fur. The tongue often remains moist throughout the\r\ncase, the coat becoming yellowish, and later brownish. Of course if\r\nthere is nasal obstruction from epistaxis or catarrh, and the patient\r\nbreathes through the mouth, the tongue will soon become dry and brown;\r\nbut in addition, this state of the tongue with sordes on the teeth and\r\nlips, appears in a small proportion of cases (3 per cent., Zuelzer; 12\r\nper cent. of our own patients) in conjunction with grave typhoid\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nDuring the intermissions the tongue clears off quite rapidly, unless\r\nmarked gastric disturbance persists, but regains its former state as\r\nsoon as the relapse occurs.\r\n\r\nIn rare cases the tongue is red and glazed, and Parry and ourselves\r\nobserved peculiar painful cracks continuing obstinately after the\r\nrelapse. It is apparent, therefore, that the tongue presents evidences\r\nof vitiated secretions, of local catarrh of the buccal mucous\r\nmembranes, and of the high grade of gastric irritation so constantly\r\nattendant on this disease.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, there is complete anorexia during all of the febrile\r\nparoxysm, while in the intermission the appetite soon returns, and is\r\nsometimes truly ravenous. We did not, however, observe in any case a\r\nvoracious appetite during the febrile paroxysms, such as was very\r\noften present during the London epidemic of 1843 and the Irish\r\nepidemic of 1847, and is particularly mentioned by Murchison.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Op. cit._, p. 360.]\r\n\r\nThirst is constant and intense, and is excited not only by the high\r\ntemperature, but by the irritation of the stomach; it may continue\r\nthrough {390} the intermission, when natural appetite and the power of\r\ndigesting solid food have returned.\r\n\r\nNausea and vomiting are always prominent symptoms, and most especially\r\nso in children. In some cases nausea occurs among the prodromes; and\r\noccasionally the attack is ushered in by profuse and uncontrollable\r\nvomiting instead of by a chill, and the stomach continues entirely\r\nnon-retentive throughout the paroxysm. Vomiting is not usually so\r\nobstinate and severe, however, and with extreme care in feeding and\r\nmedication it will often be allayed after two or three days. It\r\noccasionally recurs profusely immediately before the crisis, as in the\r\ncase given in full at page 394, where after a violent attack of\r\nvomiting the patient fell asleep, and awakened in a profuse sweat.\r\n\r\nThis symptom was present in 146 out of 182 of our cases, was usually\r\nconfined to the febrile stages, and was, as a rule, worse in the\r\ninitial paroxysm.\r\n\r\nThe matters vomited consist of the ingesta colored with bile, of\r\nglairy mucus tinged with bile, or of green bile, sometimes in\r\nconsiderable quantity. Small particles of blood may occasionally be\r\nnoticed in the matters vomited, and in rare instances true hematemesis\r\noccurs. Judging from the frequency with which in fatal cases we find\r\necchymoses of the gastric mucous membranes with blood-stained mucus in\r\nthe cavity of the stomach, we should expect black vomit to be more\r\noften observed than is the case. Murchison (p. 361) states that it was\r\nnot noted in any British epidemic except that of 1843, and then it\r\noccurred in only a few cases, although it seems to have varied in\r\nfrequency at different places. Arrott at that time described the\r\nsymptoms as \"quite common\" in the fever at Dundee; and W. Reid of\r\nGlasgow recorded the case of a girl in the same epidemic who vomited\r\nlarge quantities of clotted blood, and who also had hemorrhages from\r\nthe bowels and from the ears. It has occasionally been observed in the\r\ncontinental epidemics. It was observed in four of our cases. By all\r\nwho have observed blood-vomiting in relapsing fever it is recognized\r\nas a symptom of almost invariably fatal import. Three of the four\r\ncases in which we observed it proved fatal, but one patient, who had\r\ncopious hematemesis, both at the close of the first relapse and during\r\nthe second relapse, recovered after a desperate and protracted\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nThe bowels are not so often constipated as in typhus, and it is not\r\nrare for diarrhoea and constipation to alternate, or for the bowels to\r\nbe loose throughout the paroxysms. They are noted in 181 of our cases\r\nas regular in 32, loose in 61, and constipated in 88 instances.\r\nMeschede states that diarrhoea was present in nearly one-half the\r\ncases of the Königsberg epidemic of 1879, though usually as a late\r\nsymptom, the early stage being marked by constipation, which in a few\r\ncases persisted throughout. The stools may be consistent and dark or\r\nthin and bilious, or occasionally, when gastric or intestinal\r\nhemorrhage has occurred, they contain black coffee-ground matter.\r\nOccasionally, the diarrhoea has a critical character, and occurs at\r\nthe close either of the initial paroxysm or of the relapse, though it\r\nmay not entirely substitute sweating. This mode of crisis occurred in\r\ntwo of our cases, but Douglas observed it in 6 out of 33 cases.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen may appear enlarged, but this is as much the result of the\r\n{391} enlargement of the liver and spleen as of gaseous distension,\r\nwhich is rarely present in a high degree. Abdominal pain is almost\r\nconstant, and may be very severe. It is especially mentioned as having\r\nbeen present in 148 out of 182 of our cases. It commonly extends\r\nthroughout the epigastrium and both hypochondria, but may be present\r\non one or the other side, while, on the other hand, there may be\r\ngeneral abdominal soreness. It is associated with tenderness on\r\npressure, which may be so great as to hinder the movements of the\r\ntrunk and to render the descent of the diaphragm in breathing painful.\r\nThis may be the first symptom to usher in the attack, and it occurs at\r\nan early stage in most cases. Many of our patients when admitted to\r\nthe hospital had already been cupped or blistered over the region of\r\nthe liver or spleen. This distress was greatest in cases attended with\r\njaundice and marked gastric irritation; and Parry reports that in his\r\ncases (occurring in the early part of the epidemic which we studied)\r\njaundice was rare (4 out of 37), and abdominal tenderness was not\r\npresent. It is not difficult to explain its almost universal presence\r\nin view of the severe lesions of the substance of the liver and\r\nspleen, the distension of their capsules from the acute swelling of\r\nthe organs, and the implication of the coats of the stomach.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the liver and spleen probably exists to a greater or\r\nless degree in every case of relapsing fever without exception. This\r\nstatement is based on the concurrent testimony of accurate observers\r\nin all epidemics and upon the evidence of post-mortem examinations.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the liver can be demonstrated in nearly all\r\ninstances by careful percussion. It varies greatly in its degree,\r\nhowever; in mild cases it may be slight, while in severe ones the\r\nliver may be found extending at least three inches below the margin of\r\nthe ribs within three or four days from the initial symptom. In our\r\nown fatal cases the weight of the liver averaged between four and four\r\nand a half pounds.\r\n\r\nThe spleen enlarges even more rapidly and to a greater degree than the\r\nliver. In fact, its enlargement in relapsing fever is greater than in\r\nany other acute disease. It may be detected by percussion by the first\r\nor second day, and may then continue to rapidly increase until by the\r\nfifth or sixth day a large painful mass is readily recognized by\r\npalpation and percussion, or even by inspection. The organ often\r\nweighs twelve or sixteen ounces, not rarely twenty to twenty-five,\r\nand, as an instance of the extreme limit that may be reached, Küttner\r\nreports sixty-eight ounces in one case. This enlargement is greatest\r\ntoward the close of the first or second paroxysm, and subsides quite\r\nrapidly in most cases during the intermissions and as convalescence\r\nprogresses; we have, however, known a moderate degree of enlargement\r\nof the spleen to persist for some weeks after the crisis of the last\r\nparoxysm.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of jaundice in a considerable proportion of cases of\r\nrelapsing fever is a clinical fact of much interest. Its frequency\r\nvaries greatly in different epidemics, and even at different stages of\r\nthe same epidemic. At times it is rarely met with (1 out of 14, 20, or\r\n35 cases), while in other epidemics it is present in 1 out of every 6,\r\n5, or even 4 cases. Of 182 of our own cases jaundice is recorded in\r\n45, or exactly in 1 out of 4. According to our observation, it\r\noccurred in a larger proportion of cases among negroes (14 out of 32)\r\nthan in whites, and {392} Stillé states that it occurred in nearly\r\nevery such case that came under his observation. When present it\r\nusually occurs during the first paroxysm, and may be limited to that\r\nstage; or, again, it may be present in each of three or four\r\nsuccessive paroxysms in the same case; or, finally, it may first\r\nappear in the relapse. As a rule, it subsides speedily after the\r\ncrisis, though Carter states that in two or three cases the symptom\r\nmade its first appearance just after the crisis. It varied from the\r\nslightest yellow tinge of the conjunctiva to the deepest staining of\r\nthe whole surface. The urine is discolored in proportion to the\r\nintensity of the jaundice, and the serum of a blister will be deeply\r\ntinged. It must be carefully noted, however, that the feces are not\r\ndecolorized, but, as already described, contain fully a normal amount\r\nof biliary coloring matter. This fact has been relied on by Murchison\r\nand others to prove that the jaundice in relapsing fever is purely\r\ndependent on the morbid state of the blood, and is not due to\r\nobstruction of the biliary passages; and we are prepared to admit that\r\nthe element of blood-dyscrasia may play a part in the production of\r\nthe jaundice. The anatomical evidence, however, given on page 414,\r\nrenders it probable that in many cases at least the essential cause is\r\nto be sought in an obstructed state of the minute gall-ducts of\r\ncertain areas of the liver. If the main hepatic duct or the common\r\nduct were obstructed, there would of course be paleness of the feces,\r\nas the bile would be prevented from entering the duodenum. But when a\r\nlarge amount of highly-colored bile is being secreted, as in relapsing\r\nfever, it seems clear that the obstruction of a certain number of\r\nminute ducts would cause sufficient resorption of the bile to induce\r\njaundice of varying degrees of intensity, while at the same time\r\nallowing a flow of bile through the patulous ducts.\r\n\r\nJaundice must be regarded as an unfavorable or even a grave symptom in\r\nrelapsing fever, but not to the extent that would be the case were it\r\ndirectly connected with the intensity of the blood-dyscrasia. Many of\r\nthe most violent cases in all epidemics have been unattended with\r\njaundice, while, on the other hand, many cases in which jaundice has\r\nbeen marked \"have had not a single symptom that made them differ from\r\nordinary cases excepting the yellowness\" (Henderson). It follows,\r\ntherefore, that the gravity of a certain proportion of the jaundiced\r\ncases does not follow directly from the presence of bile in the blood\r\nand tissues, but from the lesions of the liver of which the jaundice\r\nis a symptom, or from the existence of widespread irritation of many\r\nparts of the body. Thus jaundice is present in an unusually large\r\nproportion of the cases attended with marked enlargement and\r\ntenderness of the liver and spleen, whether vomiting is also present\r\nin extreme degree or not. It was noteworthy that it was\r\ndisproportionately frequent in negroes, and that in these patients the\r\nlesions of the liver and spleen were also unusually pronounced. Again,\r\njaundice is present in an unusually large proportion of the cases\r\nattended with low delirium, extreme prostration, defective secretion\r\nof urine, and the other features of the typhoid state--so much so that\r\nsuch cases have been described by various writers under the name of\r\nbilious typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nBut, as already stated, it is not legitimate to consider the gravity\r\nof these cases as the result of the jaundice, but rather that the\r\njaundice is merely a symptom of the widespread irritative lesions,\r\nwhich in such {393} cases not only involve the liver and spleen, but\r\nthe kidneys, the lungs, the marrow of the bones, the muscle of the\r\nheart, and occasionally the membranes or substance of the brain and\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nThe true prognostic value of jaundice in relapsing fever would then\r\nseem to be, that of itself it indicates merely an obstructed state of\r\na certain number of minute bile-ducts, but that its presence justifies\r\nthe apprehension that the local lesions of the liver may become\r\nexcessively developed, or that there is a tendency to widespread\r\ntissue-changes which at a later stage of the disease may lead to the\r\nappearance of grave constitutional disturbance of a typhoid type.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage in relapsing fever is not uncommon, and may occur from\r\nvarious surfaces. Epistaxis is, however, the only form which is\r\nfrequent enough to justify being regarded as a symptom. It usually\r\noccurs in from 5 to 15 per cent. of cases of relapsing fever, but in\r\nthe Philadelphia epidemic it was much more frequent than this,\r\noccurring in not less than 83 out of 182 of our cases. It was not more\r\nfrequent or profuse in grave cases than in those of ordinary severity,\r\nand consequently could not be regarded as a reliable indication of the\r\nintensity of the blood-dyscrasia. Although ordinarily moderate in\r\namount, it was occasionally so copious and persistent as to require\r\nprolonged plugging of the nostrils, and in at least one case\r\ncontributed chiefly to cause an intense anæmia, which long delayed\r\nconvalescence. It occurs at all periods of the paroxysms, but more\r\ncommonly toward the close. In fifteen of our cases extraordinarily\r\nprofuse epistaxis attended the crisis, and evidently replaced in part\r\nthe copious sweating by which the paroxysm more commonly terminates.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS ATTENDING THE CRISIS.--We have already described the\r\naggravation of all the symptoms which immediately precedes the crisis\r\nin typical cases of relapsing fever, and the abrupt fall of\r\ntemperature, and usually of the pulse, that follows. But this\r\nextraordinary change is nearly always attended with some profuse\r\ncritical discharge, of which sweating is by far the most common,\r\nthough copious epistaxis, metrorrhagia, diarrhoea, or vomiting may\r\nalso occur, and to a greater or less degree, but seldom entirely,\r\nreplace the sweating. In 182 cases in which we carefully noted the\r\nmode of termination of the paroxysm there was no definite crisis\r\n(termination by lysis or gradual and irregular defervescence) in 76;\r\nprofuse sweating, 89; profuse epistaxis, 15; profuse diarrhoea, 2.\r\n\r\nIn most epidemics the proportion of true crises is greater than in the\r\nabove table--a fact dependent upon the unusually severe and\r\ncomplicated form of the disease which we were studying. The beginning\r\nof the sweat may be preceded by chilliness or rigors, by extreme and\r\ndangerous prostration, or by violent nervous disturbances; or there\r\nmay be an attack of profuse vomiting, followed by sleep, during which\r\nsweating begins. The sweat may be moderate in amount, but is often\r\nextraordinarily copious; the patient is literally bathed in it, the\r\nbed- and body-clothing is saturated, and we have seen the mattress\r\nsaturated. It has an acid reaction, but we do not know of any accurate\r\nanalyses of it. Some writers have attributed to it a characteristic\r\ndisagreeable odor, but we did not notice any in our cases that could\r\nbe considered peculiar to this disease.\r\n\r\nCONVALESCENCE.--We have already stated the average duration of {394}\r\nrelapsing fever to be eighteen or twenty days, while the extreme\r\nlimits are from eighteen to ninety days. Despite the fact, however,\r\nthat the mortality is in most epidemics only about 5 or 7 per\r\ncent.--greatly less, therefore, than in typhus fever--the\r\nconvalescence from relapsing fever is frequently slow and protracted.\r\nThe obvious cause is, just as in the case of typhoid fever, the\r\nexistence of numerous and serious lesions of the solids and the\r\ntendency to many troublesome complications and sequelæ. We have,\r\nhowever, seen many instances of rapid recovery of strength and health,\r\neven after prolonged attacks with several successive relapses.\r\n\r\nThe following case is quoted partly on account of the numerous\r\nrelapses, and the long duration of the sickness:\r\n\r\nB. B. Y., medical student, was much exposed to the contagion of\r\nrelapsing fever in the wards of the Philadelphia Hospital during the\r\nspring of 1870, and in May had an attack apparently of this disease,\r\nwhich, however, subsided in four or five days and was followed by no\r\nimmediate relapse. He continued his attendance at the hospital during\r\nthe remainder of May and the whole of June; in July took a trip to the\r\nSouth, where there was no relapsing fever prevailing, and after\r\nexerting himself for several days during intensely hot weather, he\r\nbecame sleepless and much prostrated. He returned home, and after\r\nrecovering from the fatigue felt quite well for about a week, until 3\r\nA.M., August 1st, when he was attacked with a severe chill, followed\r\nby great insomnia, obstinate vomiting, intense headache, especially in\r\nthe back of the neck, occasional sweating, violent fever, recurrence\r\nof very severe chill the following day at 11 A.M., epigastric and\r\nhypochondriac tenderness, decided jaundice, costive bowels, and\r\nscanty, high-colored urine. This paroxysm lasted till the morning of\r\nAugust 9th, when severe vomiting took place, followed by sleep, during\r\nwhich crisis occurred by drenching sweat lasting several hours.\r\nAppetite and strength soon began to return, though some jaundice\r\npersisted, and by August 17th he felt able to drive out a short\r\ndistance, and retired feeling somewhat fatigued. He awoke with pain in\r\nthe back of the neck, which continued increasing till 11 A.M., August\r\n18th (second paroxysm), when a severe chill occurred, lasting three\r\nhours and followed by the same train of symptoms, including jaundice,\r\nwhich persisted five days, till Aug. 23d, when crisis again occurred\r\nby sweating. On the 24th he felt well enough to use slight exercise,\r\nwhich was followed by prostration and by a return of chill (third\r\nparoxysm) the next day at 11 A.M., with subsequent headache, fever,\r\nirregular sweats, etc., lasting but one day. Again felt well until\r\nAug. 30th, when he was attacked (fourth paroxysm) at 11 A.M. with\r\nsevere chill, lasting three hours, followed by severe paroxysm,\r\nlasting six days, till Sept. 5th, when crisis again occurred by\r\nsweating. Again felt well for eight days, until Sept. 13th, when the\r\nfifth paroxysm occurred, lasting five days, ending Sept. 18th by\r\ncritical sweating. This was followed by an intermission of nine days,\r\nuntil Sept. 27th, at 11 A.M., when the sixth paroxysm occurred,\r\nlasting four days, and less severe than the preceding ones. This was\r\nfollowed by an intermission of ten days, till Oct. 11th, when the\r\nseventh paroxysm occurred at the same hour of the day, and lasted\r\nthree days. He then went sixty miles from home to a fine, pine-bearing\r\ndistrict, and enjoyed an intermission of eleven days, when the eighth\r\nand {395} last paroxysm occurred at the same hour, and lasted three\r\ndays, until Oct. 25th. His convalescence was very satisfactory, and he\r\nwas enabled to resume his studies by the middle of November. No\r\nsequelæ occurred. In 1878 Dr. Y., who had been working very steadily\r\nwith a rapidly-growing practice, was attacked with severe typhoid\r\nfever, with grave nervous symptoms and with albumen and tube-casts in\r\nthe urine, and died on the twelfth day.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that in this unusually protracted case there were\r\nseven distinct relapses, one of which was brief and interrupted one of\r\nthe regular intermissions, while the rest were all severe.\r\n\r\n  Duration of\r\n  1st paroxysm, violent,      8 days. 1st intermission, 9 days.\r\n  2d      \"     violent,      5  \"    2d       \"        1 day.\r\n  3d      \"     less violent, 1 day.  3d       \"        6 days.\r\n  4th     \"     severe,       6 days. 4th      \"        8  \"\r\n  5th     \"     severe,       5  \"    5th      \"        9  \"\r\n  6th     \"     less severe,  4  \"    6th      \"       10  \"\r\n  7th     \"     less severe,  3  \"    7th      \"       11 days,\r\n  8th     \"     mild,         3  \"    followed by convalescence.\r\n\r\nThe total duration of the case, which was entirely free from\r\ncomplications, was therefore ninety days.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.--The foregoing clinical description prepares us to\r\nappreciate the varieties of relapsing fever that may be said to exist.\r\nThey consist of--\r\n\r\nThe abortive form, in which a single paroxysm of variable length and\r\nseverity occurs, terminating in a critical fall of temperature and\r\nusually with some critical discharge, but not followed by any relapse.\r\nThere can be no doubt of the existence of such cases, although they\r\nare not common; and at times the paroxysm is so slight that were it\r\nnot for the known exposure of the individual to the prevalent epidemic\r\ninfluence, in the absence of any other adequate cause, the case might\r\nreadily be regarded as one of non-specific febricula. The caution\r\nmust, however, be borne in mind as to the occurrence of relapses of\r\nsuch extreme shortness of duration (less even than twenty-four hours)\r\nas to readily escape notice unless a careful watch be kept for their\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary or typical form, including the cases with one or two\r\nrelapses, presenting the usual variations in the severity of the\r\nsymptoms and in the duration of the paroxysms and of the\r\nintermissions.\r\n\r\nThe multiple or protracted form, if it be thought desirable to thus\r\nparticularize cases presenting an excessive and unusual number of\r\nrelapses, as three, four, five, six, or even seven.\r\n\r\nThe grave or subintrant form, which is designed to include the highly\r\ncongestive form of Cormack and the bilious typhoid of Griesinger and\r\nLebert.\r\n\r\nUnder another heading (see relations to other diseases, p. 420) we\r\nshall give reasons for regarding the bilious typhoid fever of\r\nGriesinger and Lebert as merely a form of relapsing fever, with which\r\na certain proportion of cases of true typhoid fever complicated with\r\nhepatic catarrh may have been included.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this grave subintrant form are as follows:\r\nJaundice, occasionally absent, but usually present in an intense\r\ndegree; marked enlargement of the liver and spleen; a tendency to\r\nhemorrhage from various mucous surfaces; extreme prostration;\r\ndefective or suppressed {396} secretion of urine; hypostatic\r\ncongestion or inflammation of the lungs in a large proportion of\r\ncases; dry brownish tongue; low muttering delirium, often passing into\r\nstupor or coma; hiccough; imperfect crisis; and a continuance of some\r\nmorbid phenomena, so that merely a remission occurs to separate the\r\nparoxysms; and a high percentage of mortality. The great modification\r\nof the intermission which is so highly characteristic of typhoid\r\nrelapsing fever is doubtless due in chief part to the serious local\r\nlesions developed, and seems to justify the name of subintrant as\r\nabove suggested. The course of such fever is well illustrated by the\r\nfollowing case, in which the characters of typhoid relapsing fever\r\nwere present in the highest degree, death occurring on the fifteenth\r\nday:\r\n\r\nCharles Hood, colored, æt. 28, of temperate habits, was taken ill on\r\nApril 5, 1870, after malaise lasting thirty-six hours, with fever,\r\nnausea and vomiting, headache, and general aching throughout body; and\r\nwas admitted to the hospital April 6th. There was already marked\r\njaundice, and epistaxis had occurred; there were also insomnia;\r\nwandering delirium; extreme tenderness over the liver and spleen, both\r\nof which were enlarged; dryness of tongue, vomiting, and distension of\r\nthe abdomen. These symptoms continued, his condition becoming daily\r\nmore aggravated. Restless delirium alternated with heavy sopor. The\r\njaundice grew deeper. Marked digital formication existed, but the\r\narthritic pains were not so severe as in ordinary cases. The tongue\r\nwas dry and of a red orange color. Profuse epistaxis occurred on the\r\nseventh day of the disease, requiring plugging of both anterior and\r\nposterior nares, and followed by great prostration. A gradual fall in\r\nthe temperature occurred during the sixth, seventh, and eighth days,\r\nreaching 99° on the latter day. During this decline the delirium\r\nceased and the mind remained merely dull; the jaundice decreased, as\r\ndid also the tenderness of the hypochondriac zone. The pulse and\r\nrespirations improved, and diarrhoea ceased. The improvement was but\r\nbrief; for about eighteen hours he lay apyretic, with cool hands and\r\nfeet, and with eyes closed and mind dull but free from delirium. Fever\r\nthen reappeared and with the ascent of the temperature the unfavorable\r\nsymptoms recurred. The relapse lasted but two days, and was followed\r\nby irregular decline of fever till death occurred on the fifteenth day\r\nof the disease. Obstinate hiccough appeared on the eleventh day, and\r\ncontinued, accompanied with occasional vomiting on the fourteenth day.\r\nDelirium alternating with sopor reappeared. Jaundice again became\r\nmarked, and again there was extreme tenderness over the liver and\r\nspleen. The pulse grew small and feeble, the respirations shallow and\r\nlabored, with an expiratory moan. Cough began on the twelfth day, and\r\nwas soon followed by the physical signs of pneumonia of the lower lobe\r\nof both lungs. The urine continued free from albumen. The patient sank\r\ninto deeper coma, and died on the fifteenth day. Post-mortem\r\nexamination showed highly-developed characteristic lesions of the\r\nspleen and liver, with red hepatization of lower lobe of both lungs.\r\nThere was no affection of the glands of Peyer. The course of the fever\r\nis shown in the following tracing (see Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. From a case of the bilious typhoid or grave\r\nsubintrant form of relapsing fever.]\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--As would be anticipated from what has been\r\nsaid of the wide range of the symptoms and of the remarkable course of\r\nthe temperature in relapsing fever, there are many complications and\r\nsequelæ liable to occur, and which require special consideration.\r\n{397} They may be classified according as they affect the febrile\r\nmovement, the state of the blood, or one or other of the groups of\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nWe have already described the various irregularities presented by the\r\nfebrile paroxysms and the intermissions, and no further allusion need\r\nbe made to mere variations in length, severity, or number of the\r\nformer. In rare cases, however, a peculiarity is presented, usually in\r\nthe first intermission, which is difficult of explanation. About\r\ntwenty-four hours after an apparently complete crisis, with a fall of\r\ntemperature to a subnormal point, there may be a sudden and rapid rise\r\nor rebound of temperature to 104° or 105°, attended with distressing\r\nsymptoms of high fever, but lasting only twenty-four or forty-eight\r\nhours. A good example of this is given in the case described on page\r\n394; and Carter[18] cites several examples of it terminating either in\r\nrecovery or in rapid death. He asserts that examinations of the blood\r\nduring such post-critical febrile rebounds invariably showed an\r\nabsence of spirilla, so that in his opinion such fever must be\r\nconsidered non-specific. Their explanation seems difficult, since the\r\npyrexia is too brief to be associated with any local inflammatory\r\ncomplication.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Op. cit._, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nMore frequent and serious is the protracted post-critical pyrexia\r\nwhich we have already described as modifying the interval, so as to\r\nproduce a subintrant type by maintaining continuous though irregular\r\nfever until the accession of the relapse, unless cut short by death.\r\nThis post-critical fever is non-specific, is unattended with spirilla\r\nin the blood, and is to be associated with the extensive irritative\r\nprocesses in the liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and other parts that\r\nare present in these grave and {398} complicated cases. It is to be\r\nnoted that the course of those paroxysms which terminate in lysis\r\nindicates that they may represent a milder type of the above process.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the delirium, amounting sometimes to maniacal\r\nexcitement, which attends some cases of relapsing fever, has been\r\nfully described.\r\n\r\nLess common are the following: mental hebetude, lasting some days or\r\neven weeks after the close of the last paroxysm, or, as in a case of\r\nCarter's, gradually increasing mental feebleness, terminating in\r\nimbecility. In such cases suspicion must arise of the occurrence of\r\nsome local lesion of the membranes or substance of the brain.\r\n\r\nPartial palsy is mentioned by numerous authors as occurring during or\r\nshortly after attacks of relapsing fever. Paralysis of one or both\r\ndeltoids has been noted, the latter by Cormack, who saw it continue\r\nten days after the patient was well in all other respects. Temporary\r\nparalysis of the forearm (Douglas) or of the whole arm (Parry,\r\nMeschede) has been observed; and Parry also describes loss of power in\r\nthe legs lasting for one week. In one of our cases temporary loss of\r\npower of the left arm and leg occurred, attended with such impairment\r\nof sensibility that the woman had to feel for the fingers of the left\r\nhand to assure herself of their existence. This loss of power occurred\r\nduring the initial paroxysm, and gradually passed away, but she was\r\nunable to stand alone on the thirty-first day of the disease. In a\r\ncase reported by Tennent[19] facial palsy was developed six days after\r\nthe second crisis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Glasgow Med. Jour._, May, 1871, p. 379.]\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been offered for these local palsies, but,\r\nas already stated (see page 386), it seems probable that they are\r\nreferable to morbid conditions of the nerve-trunks, or, less commonly,\r\nof the spinal cord. It must be noted, however, that in a certain\r\nnumber of autopsies serious intracranial lesions are found, which are\r\nevidently the results of the attack of relapsing fever. These consist\r\nof abscess of the brain, meningitis, and specially cerebral\r\nhemorrhage. This was present in one of our cases, but Carter found\r\ncopious hemorrhage in no less than 8 out of 54 autopsies, and in 5\r\nothers there were minute capillary cerebral hemorrhages. Still, in\r\nnearly all the cases of large hemorrhage we have found recorded the\r\neffusion was upon the surface of the brain, and this, combined with\r\nthe absence of true hemiplegia from the forms of paralysis noted in\r\nrelapsing fever, and the transient character of these palsies, makes\r\nit clear that they are not to be explained by any considerable\r\ncerebral hemorrhage. On the other hand, however, it must be admitted\r\nthat an additional possible cause of them is to be found in minute\r\nhemorrhage into small areas known to govern the movements of certain\r\ngroups of muscles. Again, we have had occasion to note the occurrence\r\nof both thrombosis and embolism among the lesions of relapsing fever,\r\nand it is evident that either of these accidents, if involving a\r\ncomparatively small branch of a cerebral vessel in certain motor\r\nareas, might cause transient paralysis, such as has been described.\r\nNor can we fail to see that, while such symptoms as the delirium,\r\nmania, coma, or subsequent mental impairment may receive other\r\nexplanations, it is possible that they may arise from similar\r\nprocesses of minute hemorrhage, thrombosis, or embolism involving\r\nother parts of the brain.\r\n\r\n{399} The frequent occurrence of severe rheumatic pains in the muscles\r\nand joints during the course of the disease has been dwelt upon (p.\r\n385); but in some cases they persisted during the intermissions and\r\nfor a considerable time after all other symptoms of disease had passed\r\naway. Occasionally they greatly retarded convalescence by interfering\r\nwith exercise and sleep. These pains were mostly in the legs, and were\r\nincreased by exercise, and also seemed to be influenced by changes of\r\nweather. Patients who suffered thus were also liable, after exposure\r\nor in consequence of severe atmospheric changes, to sharp attacks of\r\nsimilar pains elsewhere, and especially in the course of the\r\nintercostal nerves. Occasionally violent and persistent headache\r\nfollows the disease, not improbably associated with changes in the\r\nmembranes of the brain, although in other cases severe neuralgia\r\noccurs in consequence of the anæmia which may remain in an intense\r\ndegree after the fever. Troublesome numbness and soreness of the soles\r\nof the feet and of the palms of the hands, increased by pressure, has\r\nbeen noted as a sequel persisting for several days or weeks.\r\n\r\nAffections of the special senses are not rare. The most remarkable\r\namong these is the affection of the eyes, which is apt to occur far\r\nmore frequently in connection with relapsing fever than with typhus or\r\ntyphoid. The proportion of cases in which this sequel appears varies\r\ngreatly in different epidemics. In the British epidemics of 1826 and\r\n1843, when this form of post-febrile ophthalmia was first accurately\r\ndescribed by Mackenzie of Glasgow, it was very frequent; and it was\r\nequally so in Finland in 1867-68, when Estlander[20] again carefully\r\nstudied it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"U. Choroiditis nach Febris Recurrens,\" _Arch. f.\r\nOphth._, 1869, Bd. xv., Abth. ii., 108.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, so far as can be stated in regard to a sequel which\r\nmay appear after convalescence is far advanced and the patient\r\ndischarged from medical care, it was very uncommon in the Philadelphia\r\nepidemic of 1869-70. This ophthalmia may occur during the course of\r\nthe fever, but more frequently it begins during convalescence, and\r\neven some months after convalescence has been established. It occurs\r\nin patients of both sexes and at all ages. Usually it affects but one\r\neye, but both may be attacked simultaneously or consecutively.\r\nPatients who were very ill-nourished and debilitated were most apt to\r\npresent this sequel, and Murchison regards previous starvation as one\r\nof its main causes. The exciting cause and true pathology appear\r\nobscure as yet, however, and the existence of a neural origin is not\r\nimprobable. In some cases the ophthalmia has seemed to result directly\r\nfrom exposure to cold. Among our own patients, as already stated, eye\r\nsymptoms were less common and severe. A careful record of 184 cases\r\nwas kept in reference to this question. Several patients complained of\r\ndiplopia during the febrile stage, and one asserted that every object\r\nappeared fourfold to him. Conjunctivitis of moderate severity, usually\r\nassociated with otorrhoea, occurred in about 5 per cent. of our cases;\r\nit generally affected only one eye, and occurred in a few instances as\r\nlate as the third week after the relapse. In a few cases (four) also\r\nthere was dulness of vision in one eye, noted during the course of the\r\ndisease and persisting for some time after convalescence began. In\r\nonly one instance, however, did permanent impairment of vision ensue,\r\nand this man had passed through a violent attack of the fever with\r\nunusually grave nervous symptoms. {400} It left him with optic\r\nneuritis on the right side, which induced partial atrophy of the nerve\r\nand great limitation of the field of vision. Meschede reports\r\nintraocular affections in 6 cases out of 180 specially examined,\r\nthough it is not certain that such affections were directly connected\r\nwith the febrile process. Ocular ecchymosis occurs in a small\r\nproportion of cases, especially of the graver types.\r\n\r\nDulness of hearing is not so common in relapsing fever as it is in\r\ntyphoid. It was present in 14 out of 184 of our cases during the\r\ncourse of the disease, and in a few instances partial or almost\r\ncomplete deafness in one ear persisted after convalescence, owing\r\ndoubtless to a slight affection of the middle ear. In one case marked\r\ndeafness appeared suddenly on the day after the termination of the\r\nrelapse by crisis. Meschede[21] found disease of the middle ear in no\r\nless than 8 per cent. of his cases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nPurulent otorrhoea from one or both ears is of more frequent\r\noccurrence, and without any special exciting cause may present itself\r\nat any time during the course of the disease or more commonly after\r\nthe relapse. In the same manner purulent coryza may occur.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions occasionally present during the fever have been\r\ndescribed. Bed-sores from pressure are much less common than in\r\ntyphus, but are met with in a small proportion of cases. As a rule,\r\nthey are of moderate size and heal quickly. Superficial gangrene of\r\nthe lips, nose, and ears has also been noted in rare cases (Zuelzer)\r\nin connection with gangrene of the extremities, probably from\r\nembolism. The occasional occurrence of painful boils, of abscesses in\r\nthe cellular tissues (Wyss and Bock), and the more rare occurrence of\r\nerysipelas may be mentioned among the sequelæ.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the severe pains in the joints and members which so\r\nfrequently occur during relapsing fever are, as a rule, unattended by\r\nany redness or swelling of the joints. In rare cases, however, there\r\nis effusion into the joints during the fever, or more commonly there\r\nare attacks during convalescence which simulate subacute rheumatic\r\narthritis. Such attacks may last but a few days, but in several of our\r\ncases there was painful swelling of the knees, wrists, and fingers\r\nwhich persisted for several weeks after the fever, being attended with\r\nslight crepitation on motion, and altogether behaving like subacute\r\nrheumatism.\r\n\r\nAs would be expected from the severity of the fever, the marked\r\ndisorder of digestion, and the lesions of the spleen and liver in\r\nrelapsing fever, anæmia is a common sequel. In cases where there has\r\nalso been free hemorrhage, usually in the form of epistaxis, the\r\nanæmia may indeed reach an intense degree.\r\n\r\nThe cardiac murmurs which have been described as present in a certain\r\nproportion of cases are dependent upon the blood-changes, and when the\r\nanæmia is extreme these murmurs are also audible over the large veins\r\nand the pulmonary artery, and persist after convalescence is fully\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nOedema of the lower extremities occurs in a considerable number of\r\ncases. It is clearly due in part to the anæmia, but the cardiac\r\ndebility which follows the fever is also largely concerned in its\r\nproduction. It was, indeed, marked in some of our cases where no\r\nanæmic murmurs existed, but where there was great nervous and muscular\r\ndebility. {401} Usually limited to the feet and ankles, it\r\noccasionally extended above the knees, and in one case, where great\r\nanæmia and debility from fever and over-exertion coexisted, there was\r\noedema of the hands and wrists, with great distension of the legs up\r\nto the hips. It is not associated with albuminuria as a rule, and\r\nyields readily to treatment and rest, in the course of a few weeks.\r\n\r\nHemorrhages from various surfaces have already been mentioned, and a\r\nfull account given of epistaxis, which is by far the most common form.\r\nBloody vomiting has been noticed in a small proportion of cases in\r\nvarious epidemics. It varies in amount, but is always attended with\r\ngreat gravity of the attack, and usually is followed by fatal results.\r\nIt occurred in four of our cases, two of which presented also black\r\nstools containing altered blood, and suppression of urine; while in\r\nanother it occurred at the close of the first relapse, and during the\r\nsecond relapse was copious and repeated. In this case it was attended\r\nwith alarming symptoms of collapse, from which the patient rallied,\r\nand after a desperate struggle recovered.\r\n\r\nBlood may also be discharged from the bowels in such large amount as\r\nto constitute actual hemorrhage--a symptom of great gravity; or in\r\nsmall quantity and completely altered, so as to impart an inky black\r\ncolor to the stools--a condition not necessarily attended with urgent\r\ndanger; or, finally, there may be frequent bloody dysenteric stools.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage has also been observed from the uterus, from the kidneys,\r\nfrom the ears, and from the old cicatrix of a syphilitic chancre.\r\nHemorrhage occurred in 87 out of 183 of our cases, or in nearly 50 per\r\ncent. It was from the nostrils in 82 cases, from the uterus in 1 case,\r\nfrom the stomach in 4 cases, and from the cicatrix of a chancre in 1\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSudden collapse occurs with such comparative frequency in relapsing\r\nfever as to require special attention as one of its complications. It\r\nmay occur at any period of the disease, but it is most common at the\r\ncrisis of the first paroxysm or of the relapse. The symptoms are\r\nusually those of cardiac failure, with rapid, small, and feeble pulse;\r\nshallow and hurried, or slow, labored, and imperfect respiration;\r\ncoldness of the extremities, while the central temperature may remain\r\nelevated; muttering delirium, rapidly passing into unconsciousness.\r\nOccasionally almost instantaneous death occurs from syncope induced by\r\nsome muscular exertion, as standing up or even rising in bed. In other\r\ncases the symptoms indicate the development of cardiac thrombosis, and\r\nsubsequent examination has verified this opinion. In still other cases\r\nthe symptoms resemble those which occur in extreme hyperpyrexia\r\ndependent upon overwhelming and paralysis of the nervous centres.\r\nCopious hemorrhage from the stomach and nose may also induce syncope\r\nof alarming and even fatal severity. When from the latter cause,\r\nreaction may be induced and the patient may ultimately recover, as we\r\nsaw in a case where after repeated hematemesis the patient sank into\r\nprofound collapse. In all of its forms, however, this complication is\r\nof extreme and imminent danger, and death follows, as a rule, in a few\r\nhours. The cases in which it occurs are usually of severe type,\r\noccurring in persons who have previously been in poor health or\r\nintemperate, or who have been subjected to privation and improper\r\nexposure previous to and during the early stages of their attack.\r\nStill, collapse may occur in mild cases {402} also, and whatever the\r\ntype of the disease there may be no special indication of approaching\r\ntrouble, when the patient rapidly passes into collapse, to be followed\r\nby death in a few hours. It occurred in nine of about two hundred\r\ncases under our observation. In one it was the result of hemorrhage\r\nfrom the stomach, and ended in recovery; in one, at the close of the\r\ninitial paroxysm the patient, who was stupid, with muttering delirium,\r\nsank into collapse as the temperature rapidly fell from 105° to 97°,\r\nand died in a few hours; in one, on the fourth day of the relapse the\r\ntemperature suddenly fell from 102° to 96°, with free sweating, but\r\nsuddenly rebounded to 102°, with very rapid, feeble pulse, distinct\r\nbasic cardiac murmur, constriction of chest, restlessness and\r\ndelirium, slight convulsions, and death in eight hours; in one, a man\r\nat the end of the initial paroxysm, immediately after his admission to\r\nthe hospital in apparently fair condition, became violently delirious,\r\nwith bounding pulse, soon grew comatose, and died in one hour; in one,\r\na man who was in feeble condition, on the nineteenth day, with\r\nirregular persistent fever (he had splenic abscess), sat up on the\r\nedge of the bed, sank back in syncope, and died in less than an hour;\r\nin one, a man who did well until the second day of the relapse, when\r\npleuro-pneumonia and pericarditis were developed, died suddenly four\r\ndays later: there was considerable pericardial effusion; in one,\r\nsudden death from syncope or cardiac thrombosis occurred on the\r\ntwelfth day in a man who had suppurative parotitis and metastatic\r\nabscesses of the lungs; in one, sudden collapse and death occurred in\r\none and a half hours at the end of the initial paroxysm; in one, a\r\ndrunkard with large fatty liver had pyrexia continuing after the\r\ninitial paroxysm, and on the ninth day, while in a state of hebetude,\r\nwith mild delirium and a pulse of 112, coma suddenly occurred, and\r\ndeath followed in two hours.\r\n\r\nPericarditis is a rare complication, and is apt to coexist with\r\npleuro-pneumonia. This combination occurred in one of our cases where\r\npleuro-pneumonia and pericarditis were developed on the second day of\r\nrelapse, and proved fatal by sudden collapse on the fifth day, with\r\nthe pericardial sac distended with serum and its layers coated with\r\nplastic lymph.\r\n\r\nThrombosis of veins, as in phlegmasia alba dolens, occurs much more\r\nrarely than after typhoid fever. Arterial embolism, on the other hand,\r\nis not uncommon. Murchison[22] reports a case in which gangrene of the\r\nleft foot from obstruction of the left femoral artery, together with\r\ncerebral softening from obstruction of the left middle cerebral\r\nartery, occurred in connection with cardiac thrombosis. Zuelzer\r\nalludes to similar cases in the St. Petersburg epidemic of 1865-66,\r\nwhere, in addition to the extremities, the nose, ears, and lips became\r\ngangrenous. Other examples of embolism are found in lesions of the\r\nspleen and kidneys, where infarctions are of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Op. cit._, p 384.]\r\n\r\nHeart-clot, or cardiac thrombosis, appears to occur more frequently\r\nthan in any other acute zymotic disease, with the exception of\r\ndiphtheria. Even when the occurrence of passive hemorrhages and of\r\necchymoses of various tissues indicates marked dyscrasia of the blood,\r\nthere will not rarely be found firm white clots in one or other of the\r\ncavities of the heart. These frequently present unmistakable evidences\r\n{403} of ante-mortem formation, and, as already stated, there is a\r\ncertain proportion of the cases of rapid and unexpected death where\r\nthe fatal result is directly due to cardiac thrombosis, attended with\r\nthe usual symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe constant affection of the spleen has been fully described; it is\r\nnot therefore surprising that both complications and sequelæ arise in\r\nconnection with it. At times, in cases which ultimately recover, the\r\npain in the splenic region is so violent and continuous, and is\r\nattended with so much tenderness over the enlarged organ, that\r\nlocalized peritonitis is undoubtedly present. Occasionally this\r\nperisplenitis persists, and in conjunction with the inflammatory\r\nchanges in the substance of the spleen maintains an irregular fever\r\nafter the specific pyrexia has run its course. This was noticed in\r\nseveral of our cases, but especially so in a case where, after the\r\ninitial paroxysm, an irregular fever was kept up, obscuring the\r\nrelapse, until the nineteenth day, when death occurred suddenly from\r\nsyncope on rising on the edge of the bed, and where examination showed\r\nsplenic peritonitis, with a splenic abscess as large as a pigeon's\r\negg.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the spleen usually subsides during the\r\nintermission, and disappears speedily or in the course of a few weeks\r\nafter convalescence is established. Occasionally, however, it\r\npersists, and is attended with marked anæmia. In one case, where death\r\noccurred from pneumonia, the sequel of relapsing fever, at about the\r\nthirtieth day, the spleen weighed twenty-nine ounces; and in another\r\ncase, where death occurred from gangrenous pleuro-pneumonia, at the\r\nfortieth day, the spleen was still enlarged and presented\r\ncharacteristic changes in its pulp. On the other hand, in a case where\r\ndeath occurred on the twelfth day of typhus, occurring forty-four days\r\nafter recovery from a very bad case of relapsing fever, making it\r\naltogether the one hundredth day, none of the lesions of the first\r\ndisease were discoverable.\r\n\r\nRupture of the spleen occurs occasionally, and is usually attended\r\nwith sudden pain, collapse, and speedy death. Murchison refers to two\r\nexamples recorded by Zuelzer and one by Hudson; Petersen reports\r\nfifteen cases, in seven of which sudden rupture occurred with speedy\r\ndeath, while in the other eight the rupture followed local softening\r\nfrom infarction, and resulted in death in a few days from purulent\r\nperitonitis.\r\n\r\nIn one of our cases, where death occurred on the sixteenth day,\r\napparently from double pneumonia and heart-clot, it was found that\r\nthere was a rupture in the enlarged spleen near its upper end, recent\r\nplastic peritonitis in the region of the spleen, and a moderate amount\r\nof bloody pulpy fluid throughout the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, disturbances within the respiratory tract occur with\r\nvery different frequency in different epidemics. In many they are\r\nrare, while in 1870 we noticed cough and other evidences of\r\nrespiratory trouble in no less than 90 out of 200 cases.\r\n\r\nSevere catarrhal laryngitis is a rare and dangerous complication. It\r\ndid not occur in our cases, but both Begbie and Paterson report cases\r\nof it which required tracheotomy, and Wyss and Bock met with\r\nulcerative laryngitis with perichondritis.\r\n\r\nBronchitis of moderate severity, although rare in many epidemics,\r\n{404} occurs so frequently in others, as in Philadelphia in 1870, as\r\nto rank as a symptom of the disease.\r\n\r\nPneumonia is one of the most fatal complications. The results of our\r\nown observations agree with the statements of Jenner and of Carter,\r\nthat it is the next most common lesion after enlargement of the liver\r\nand spleen. On the other hand, Murchison noted it only in 4 or 5 out\r\nof 600 cases. It occurred in at least 11 of our cases, 8 of which were\r\nfatal; and unquestionably less extensive inflammation was present in\r\nother cases which recovered, in view of the marked respiratory\r\ndisturbances frequently present. Both lungs were involved in 4 cases;\r\nof the remainder, the right and left were about equally divided. Out\r\nof 23 autopsies, the lesions of pneumonia were found 8 times. The\r\nlower lobes were affected in every case. The form of this disease was\r\ncroupous in 9 cases; in 1 it was that of metastatic suppuration, and\r\nin 1 it was more properly described as splenification. The amount of\r\nplastic pleurisy associated with it was usually great, and in one case\r\nthere was also severe pericarditis. In another case the disease\r\nadvanced to the stage of gangrene of a circumscribed area of the\r\npleura and of the superficial layer of the lung. In only one instance\r\nwas albuminuria present. In two cases the pneumonia occurred so late\r\nin the course of the disease that it might be regarded as a sequel.\r\nDeath occurred in one of these on the thirtieth day, and in the other\r\n(that in which gangrene ensued) it ran a subacute course, and death\r\ndid not take place until the fortieth day. In the other cases the\r\ndisease began at the close of the initial paroxysm, during the\r\nintermission, or early in the relapse. As would be expected, the\r\nsympathetic fever due to this complication modified and obscured the\r\ncharacteristic course of the specific pyrexia.\r\n\r\nThis rare termination in gangrene has been noted by other observers;\r\nin all five or six times. Parry met with a truly remarkable case of\r\ndouble pneumonia, followed by gangrene, and yet resulting in recovery.\r\nJaundice is apt to attend cases of relapsing fever which are\r\ncomplicated with pneumonia.\r\n\r\nPleurisy is an almost constant accompaniment of pneumonia, and\r\nfrequently occurs in marked degree. It may also be present in cases of\r\nsevere splenic inflammation. In all probability, localized plastic\r\npleurisy is not infrequent, and may cause some of the severe thoracic\r\npains so frequently present.\r\n\r\nMetastatic abscesses of the lung occur occasionally as a result of the\r\nprofound toxæmia, and are apparently preceded by patches of\r\ninfarction, which soften in the centre, as in the usual development of\r\npyæmic abscesses. This condition was found in one of our cases in\r\nconjunction with suppurative parotitis. It has been included among the\r\ninstances of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nAcute miliary tuberculosis, involving chiefly the lungs and intestinal\r\ncanal, occurred as a sequel in one case under our observation, and\r\nphthisis has been found to follow by other observers (Carter). It is\r\nto be expected that if the patient did not so quickly pass from under\r\nobservation it would be found that an affection so gravely\r\ncomplicating nutrition as does relapsing fever is frequently followed\r\nby serious organic disease.\r\n\r\nParotitis is mentioned by so few authors as to show that it is a {405}\r\nrare complication in most epidemics, varying from 1 in 600 to 1 in 50\r\ncases. One gland only is affected at a time as a rule, though both may\r\nbe involved successively. The inflammation begins either during the\r\nintermission or the relapse, and may terminate by resolution or by\r\nsuppuration. Although a painful and severe complication, it is\r\nfollowed by recovery in a considerable proportion of cases. Carter[23]\r\nstates \"that in some degree it was noted in 2 or 3 per cent. of all\r\ncases, and nearly as often amongst survivors as in the casualties.\" It\r\noccurred in three of our cases (185); once it underwent resolution;\r\nonce suppuration occurred in the parotid and in the masseter muscle,\r\nwith metastatic abscesses in the lungs, and death; and once the\r\npatient, who had previously existing amyloid degeneration of liver and\r\nspleen without albuminuria, had severe relapsing fever with two\r\nrelapses, in the first of which parotitis occurred in both glands,\r\nsuccessively terminating in suppuration, after which he did well\r\nthrough an apyretic period of six weeks, when sudden high fever\r\nappeared, followed by speedy death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Op. cit._, p. 210.]\r\n\r\nPharyngitis and tonsillitis of mild grade occur in from 3 to 25 per\r\ncent. of the cases in different epidemics.\r\n\r\nHiccough deserves to be ranked among the complications, because it is\r\nof frequent occurrence, obstinate and annoying. It occurred in a\r\nconsiderable proportion of our cases, and much more frequently in\r\nthose who had jaundice. It was often present both in the initial\r\nparoxysm and in the relapse, but disappeared soon after the end of the\r\npyrexia. It bore no constant relation to the severity of the vomiting.\r\nNot rarely it lasted several days and nights, causing exhaustion and\r\ninterference with sleep and proving rebellious to treatment.\r\nHypodermic injections of morphia and atropia, chloroform internally,\r\nand extremely careful alimentation proved most serviceable.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage from the stomach has already been spoken of (see p. 390).\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea, as already stated (see p. 390), occurs much more frequently\r\nthan in typhus fever, varying from 1 per cent. (Murchison) to 15 per\r\ncent. (Scotch epidemics) or 33 per cent. (Philadelphia), or even 50\r\nper cent. (Königsberg). It is usually of moderate severity, but\r\noccasionally is so profuse and intractable as to constitute the main\r\ncause of death. In some epidemics the attacks of looseness occur\r\nalmost exclusively after the relapse, but in others the bowels are\r\nfrequently loose during the febrile stages. In our cases there were\r\nnot infrequently from three to eight thin, dark, bilious or light\r\nyellowish stools daily after the second or third day of the initial\r\nparoxysm, and then the looseness would stop during the intermission,\r\nprobably to recur in the relapse. Occasionally diarrhoea with very\r\nfrequent liquid stools occurs at the close of one or both of the\r\nfebrile stages, assuming a critical character, and substituting more\r\nor less of the sweating which is the common mode of crisis, although\r\nin several such cases quoted by Murchison from Douglas the sweating,\r\ndespite the critical diarrhoea, was usually profuse. It can scarcely\r\nbe said that there is any relationship between diarrhoea and vomiting;\r\nboth are frequently present, and may even be severe and persistent in\r\nthe same case, though either may be marked while the other is moderate\r\nor slight. Abdominal pain and tenderness in the epigastrium and\r\nhypochondria are constant symptoms, but when diarrhoea is marked there\r\nare apt also to be griping {406} pains and tenderness in the lower\r\nsegment of the abdomen. When diarrhoea occurs as a sequel, either\r\nbeginning after the close of the relapse or continuing in cases where\r\nthe bowels have been loose during pyrexia, it is apt to prove\r\nobstinate and intractable, or even to lead to a fatal result.\r\n\r\nThe character of the stools varies much; usually thin and dark, they\r\nmay be light yellowish or even whitish. Thus, in a severe case with\r\ndeep jaundice we observed seven liquid and decidedly whitish stools in\r\ntwenty-four hours. In such instances there is undoubtedly more or less\r\ncomplete closure of the biliary ducts by plugs of mucus or by swelling\r\nof the mucous membrane. On the other hand, the stools may be inky\r\nblack from admixture with altered blood, or, lastly, they may consist\r\nof mucus and blood, in which event the complication assumes the form\r\nof actual dysentery and is attended with increased abdominal pain and\r\nwith tenesmus. Dysentery was, as would be expected, quite frequent in\r\nthe Indian epidemics studied by Carter.[24] It is usually of moderate\r\nseverity, but occasionally it runs into gangrenous inflammation, is\r\nattended with perforation of the bowel, or is followed by hepatic\r\nabscess. In one instance we noticed a peculiarly fetid puriform\r\ndischarge from the anus, which occurred during the relapse and\r\npersisted for several weeks, gradually subsiding, as though from some\r\nunhealthy ulceration which slowly healed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Op. cit._, p. 218.]\r\n\r\nJaundice is of frequent occurrence, but has been sufficiently\r\ndiscussed at page 391.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis is not rare in its circumscribed form. This statement is\r\nbased on the comparative frequency with which localized splenic\r\nperitonitis, of varying degrees of severity, is found after death in\r\nrelapsing fever from various causes, and from the great frequency of\r\nsevere pain and tenderness in the region of the enlarged spleen in\r\nfavorable cases. In its lesser degrees it may not add materially to\r\nthe danger of the patient, but in more severe forms, associated with\r\nserious splenic lesions, it may run a protracted subacute course and\r\nmaintain irregular fever.\r\n\r\nGeneral peritonitis is, on the other hand, a rare complication,\r\noccurring not more than once in several hundred cases. It results from\r\ndysenteric perforation of the bowel, from rupture of a splenic\r\nabscess, or from rupture of the spleen itself. An example of this\r\nlatter accident which occurred under our observation has already been\r\ngiven. Speedy death invariably follows, though in the case just\r\nreferred to the symptoms of peritonitis were totally masked by those\r\nof the coexisting double pneumonia, which seemed to be the immediate\r\ncause of death.\r\n\r\nSuppuration of the mesenteric glands is a rare complication, mentioned\r\nespecially by Wyss and Bock. As these glands are not usually found\r\nenlarged, there being no irritative lesion of the intestines of common\r\noccurrence in relapsing fever, it is probable that the collections of\r\npus which have been found were metastatic in origin.\r\n\r\nDyspepsia is not an infrequent sequel, as would necessarily be the\r\ncase after a disease characterized by so much gastric irritation and\r\nby such serious lesions of the liver and spleen. As a consequence,\r\ncare in diet is often required for a considerable period after the\r\ncourse of the disease has ended; dyspeptic symptoms are frequently\r\ncomplained of, and marked emaciation and anæmia often protract\r\nconvalescence.\r\n\r\n{407} It may be observed that a striking appearance of emaciation is\r\noften developed shortly after the crisis of the first paroxysm, or,\r\nmore particularly, of the relapse. It is partly due to the actual loss\r\nof weight during the high pyrexia, but even more to the abrupt\r\ntransition from a state of extreme febrile turgescence to one of\r\nequally extreme relaxation and maceration of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe amount of urine has been seen (p. 387) to vary greatly in cases\r\ndistinguished by no special disorder of the kidneys; the extremes in\r\nordinary cases being from twelve or fifteen ounces just before the\r\ncrisis to from eighty to one hundred and twenty within forty-eight\r\nhours after the crisis. Suppression is, however, sometimes noted, and\r\nis always a grave symptom, though Parry[25] reports more than one case\r\nin which on several successive days there was not more in twenty-four\r\nhours than one fluidounce of non-albuminous urine, and in which no\r\nsymptoms of uræmia occurred, and the sweat had no urinous odor. In one\r\nof our fatal cases, with intense jaundice, hematemesis, inky black\r\nstools, and oedema of the feet and of the lungs, there was not a drop\r\nof urine secreted during the last four days of the initial paroxysm;\r\ndeath occurred on the eighth day, and the kidneys were found intensely\r\nengorged, of a deep blackish-blue color, with numerous ecchymoses in\r\nthe cortex, due to impaction of the convoluted tubules with blood,\r\nwhile the renal epithelium was granular and swollen, and many tubules\r\nwere filled with epithelial cells and granular matter. At the autopsy\r\nthe urinary bladder was firmly contracted and contained a very small\r\namount of bloody liquid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Op. cit._]\r\n\r\nMore frequently, incontinence of urine, with or without retention,\r\noccurs during the febrile stages--according to our observation, most\r\ncommonly in cases attended with mental disturbance and tending to a\r\ntyphoid condition. The symptom was not of very grave significance,\r\nhowever, and after the use of the catheter for a few days the bladder\r\nregained its tone.\r\n\r\nAlbumen is quite frequently present in small amounts during the\r\npyrexia of relapsing fever. Thus, in 18 cases of ordinary severity,\r\nwhich all recovered, and in which the urine was carefully examined\r\ndaily, a trace of albumen was found in 5; in 2 cases it appeared both\r\nin the initial paroxysm and in the relapse, but in all instances its\r\npresence was of brief duration. In one of these five cases the albumen\r\nappeared at both critical periods, when the amounts of urine in\r\ntwenty-four hours were respectively 150 ccm. and 250 ccm.; but in the\r\nother cases the transient albuminuria coincided with free secretion of\r\nurine (1250 ccm., 1850 ccm.). It is probable that were the same\r\ncareful search to be made in all cases the presence of albumen would\r\nbe detected in fully 20 to 25 per cent. On the other hand, in fatal\r\ncases the occurrence of albuminuria is by no means constant, although\r\nundoubtedly it is present in a larger proportion of such cases than of\r\nthose of ordinary severity.\r\n\r\nOur experience does not confirm that of Murchison, who states that he\r\nnever met with typhoid symptoms in relapsing fever without albuminuria\r\nor some other evidence of retarded elimination by the kidneys. In\r\nseveral of our cases where the typhoid state was developed in the\r\nhighest degree repeated examination of the urine failed to discover\r\nalbumen.\r\n\r\n{408} Most observers have been struck with the comparative immunity of\r\nthe kidneys from serious disturbance in a disease presenting such\r\ncomplicated morbid processes and widespread lesions as relapsing\r\nfever. To show, however, that these organs suffer specially in certain\r\nepidemics, it may be mentioned that Obermeier[26] reports having found\r\nalbumen with tube-casts of various kinds in 32 out of 40 cases of\r\nrelapsing fever, thus showing that, in the particular epidemic he was\r\nstudying, catarrhal nephritis was of almost uniform occurrence. It is\r\ntrue that serious interference with the elimination of urea and other\r\nnitrogenous matters may occur without the coexistence of albuminuria,\r\nso that it is impossible to deny that severe nervous symptoms may\r\nresult from impaired renal activity even when the urine contains no\r\nalbumen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: \"U. d. wiederkehrende Fieber,\" _Arch. f. path. Anat. u.\r\nklin. Med._, Bd. xlvii. p. 170.]\r\n\r\nAttention has already been called to the variations presented in the\r\namounts of urea, but more extended observations are required to show\r\nthe precise relations of these variations to the graver nervous\r\nphenomena. It will be found, we venture to opine, that, while in one\r\ngroup of relapsing-fever cases of grave type, cerebral symptoms are\r\ndependent upon the retention and accumulation in the system of urea\r\nand other effete nitrogenous products, owing to interference with\r\nrenal activity from pre-existing organic disease of the kidneys or\r\nfrom an exceptional degree of congestion of those organs, there are\r\nother groups where similar typhoid cerebral symptoms are more directly\r\ndependent upon the specific toxæmia, upon the hyperpyrexia, upon\r\nexhaustion of the nerve-centres by intense peripheral irritation, or\r\nupon congestion or other morbid conditions of the nerve-centres\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where cerebral symptoms manifest themselves in relapsing\r\nfever the daily examination of the urine--which here, as in other\r\nzymotic diseases, is a duty in all cases--becomes of extreme\r\nimportance. Three conditions should be borne in mind in such\r\nexaminations. In the first place, the attack of fever may have\r\noccurred in one already the subject of organic kidney disease, and,\r\nconsidering the classes from which the majority of the cases of\r\nrelapsing fever are drawn, this possibility cannot be of rare\r\noccurrence. Out of eighteen post-mortem examinations in which the\r\nkidneys were studied with especial care we found positive evidence of\r\npre-existing organic disease four times. In these cases the\r\nalbuminuria was marked and persistent, though tube-casts were rarely\r\nfound, and severe cerebral symptoms of typhoid type were prominently\r\npresent. In another highly interesting case the patient, who had\r\namyloid disease of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, contracted severe\r\nrelapsing fever; he had increased albuminuria during both febrile\r\nstages, suppurative parotitis, but no grave cerebral symptoms, and\r\napparently recovered. After an apyretic period of six weeks, during\r\nwhich the symptoms of the amyloid visceral disease persisted, a sudden\r\nand rapidly fatal pyrexia occurred. Unfortunately, the existence of\r\nspirillar infection of the blood was not known at the time.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the attack of fever may become complicated with\r\nacute nephritis from special localization of the poison, as in\r\nObermeier's cases, or from vulnerability of the kidneys. In such cases\r\ncareful study of the urine should indicate the event, and the\r\nprognosis, though grave, is not so hopeless as in the first instance.\r\nAn interesting example of {409} this occurred under our observation,\r\nwhere the patient, who had apparently an ordinary attack, was seized\r\nwith acute catarrhal nephritis, with temporary uræmia, during the\r\nrelapse, but after a dangerous illness recovered without any organic\r\nrenal disease as a sequel.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, may be found the more usual and more\r\nreadily-determined condition of slight and transient albuminuria (with\r\nvariations in urea excretion) which has already been discussed, and\r\nwhich has no serious prognostic significance.\r\n\r\nThe following very interesting case deserves special mention: The\r\npatient, a man aged thirty-six, was admitted on the fifteenth day of\r\nan attack of acute catarrhal nephritis, with slight ascites, marked\r\noedema of the feet and legs, and highly albuminous urine. In the\r\ncourse of ten days the oedema and albuminuria were much diminished,\r\nwhen on the thirteenth day after admission he was attacked with\r\nrelapsing fever, the ward in which he lay containing a number of\r\npersons ill with that disease. The initial paroxysm was severe, but\r\nwithout any grave cerebral symptoms; the urine grew scanty, dark, and\r\nbloody, and the oedema increased and invaded the pelvis. Crisis\r\noccurred on the fifth day, temperature falling 9°, sweating copious,\r\nurine 473 ccm. in twenty-four hours, color of porter, highly\r\nalbuminous, and depositing blood, renal epithelium, hyaline, granular\r\nand epithelial casts, all stained reddish. Two days later, urine 1600\r\nccm., light colored, with only a small amount of albumen.\r\n\r\nA slight and brief relapse (101° for two days) occurred after an\r\ninterval of four days; a second imperfect relapse (100.5° for three\r\ndays) after a further interval of six days; and finally, after a\r\nfurther interval of only two days, a violent relapse (temperature\r\nrising rapidly to 106°) with crisis (fall of 8° in twelve hours) at\r\nclose of fifth day. The oedema gradually diminished from the time of\r\nthe first crisis, did not increase in the relapses, and disappeared\r\ncompletely and finally about ten days after the last relapse. The\r\nurine was very free after the first paroxysm, averaging from 2000 to\r\n2300 ccm. During the subsequent febrile periods it did not decrease,\r\nand indeed on the second day of the last relapse, with the temperature\r\nat 105°, the amount in twenty-four hours was 3200 ccm. Four days\r\nsubsequently, during crisis, the amount was only 350 ccm.\r\n\r\nThe albumen disappeared entirely from the urine in two weeks from the\r\nclose of the last relapse; there had then been no tube-casts for some\r\ndays, and the patient was discharged entirely well a short time\r\nafterward. The treatment consisted of hot vapor-baths, repeated dry\r\ncupping over the kidneys, infusion of digitalis with acetate of potash\r\nduring pyrexia, and Basham's iron mixture in the intermissions. It\r\nseemed that the occurrence of the relapsing fever interfered\r\nwonderfully little with the recovery from nephritis.\r\n\r\nHematuria is a comparatively rare and very grave complication. It may\r\noccur as an additional evidence of the dyscrasia of the blood in\r\nconnection with hemorrhages from other surfaces, or as in the case we\r\nhave before referred to or in that reported by Murchison,[27] it\r\nresults from intense engorgement of the kidneys. In Murchison's case\r\nhematuria, with much albumen and tube-casts, occurred in both\r\nparoxysms {410} without any uræmic or typhoid symptoms, and was\r\nfollowed by satisfactory recovery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Op. cit._, p. 370.]\r\n\r\nSugar is sometimes present in small quantity as a transient symptom;\r\nand diabetes has been observed as a sequel.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Tyson, _Phila. Med. Times_, 1871, i. 418.]\r\n\r\nMetastatic inflammation of the kidneys, with centres of suppuration,\r\nwas observed by Wyss and Bock.\r\n\r\nWhen menstruation occurs during relapsing fever, as it may do at any\r\ntime, it is apt to be excessive, and may amount to severe hemorrhage.\r\nCrisis has been known to occur in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe numerous cases reported by various observers of relapsing fever\r\noccurring in pregnant women establish the rule that abortion almost\r\ninvariably occurs, whatever may be the stage of the pregnancy. In a\r\nlarge majority of cases the mother recovers, but the child, if viable,\r\nis stillborn or dies in a few hours. Only two of our patients were\r\npregnant women, and the result in each was unusual. In one, the\r\npatient, already the mother of several children, was in the fifth\r\nmonth of gestation; the initial paroxysm was severe, with delirium,\r\nbut no symptoms of abortion occurred; the intermission lasted six\r\ndays, during which she felt very well; the relapse was also severe,\r\nand crisis occurred on the fifth day, the temperature falling below\r\nnormal, and the case promising to do well; but on the following day\r\nthere was a sudden rebound of temperature, pulse 140, severe\r\npræcordial pain, and death occurred in twenty-four hours, the contents\r\nof the uterus being partially expelled during the act of dying. In the\r\nother case, a girl of eighteen years, who had aborted at the third\r\nmonth of gestation eight months previously, and who was again three\r\nmonths advanced in pregnancy when attacked with relapsing fever, went\r\nsafely through a bad attack and carried her baby successfully to full\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The surface of the body often presents patches of\r\nlivid discoloration, and jaundice persists in cases where it has been\r\npresent during life. There is but little appearance of emaciation,\r\nexcept in cases where it has been present before the attack.\r\n\r\nWhen death occurs while the temperature is high the body remains warm\r\nan unusual length of time. Thus, in one case where death occurred at\r\n11.30 P.M., the temperature at 12 was 103°, and at 1 A.M. it was\r\n101-3/5°, that of the room being 73°; at 6 A.M. it remained at 93°,\r\nthe room being at 73°; between 9 A.M. and 2 P.M. the room was kept at\r\n55°, but the body was still at 82° at the latter hour.\r\n\r\nThe voluntary muscles are often jaundiced, and in prolonged cases they\r\nmay be found flabby and having undergone marked granular degeneration.\r\nIn many cases, however, they remain quite dark and firm. Ecchymoses of\r\nthe muscular substance are met with occasionally.\r\n\r\nIn one case, where during life there had been painful swelling of the\r\nleft parotid region, with fistulous openings on the cheek, and where\r\ndeath occurred on the twelfth day of the disease, the masseter muscle\r\nwas swollen, with patches of dark, almost black, discoloration from\r\necchymosis, and was studded throughout with small collections in its\r\nsubstance. The fluid from these contained very numerous cells\r\nindistinguishable from leucocytes. The muscular fibrils were friable\r\nand granular, and there was multiplication of the nuclei of the\r\nsarcolemma. {411} These unusual lesions seemed to have originated in\r\ninterstitial disintegrating thrombi, with consequent inflammation of\r\nthe muscle.\r\n\r\nThe muscle of the heart is more frequently affected, and in the fatal\r\ncases our attention was particularly drawn to those lesions.\r\nPonfick[29] has also described them minutely. The degree of change\r\nvaries from a partial loss of transverse striation, with slight\r\ngranular appearance, up to a very high degree of granulo-fatty\r\ndegeneration. The organ is then flabby, its substance pale gray or\r\nbrownish, either wholly or in streaks, and microscopic examination\r\nshows an extreme degree of fatty granular change. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that many of the subjects of relapsing fever have\r\nbeen leading irregular and dissipated lives, and that in some\r\ninstances the lesions of fatty degeneration detected in their organs\r\nmay have been the result of their previous habits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Virchow's Archiv. f. path. Anat._, Bd. lx. Hft. 2, p.\r\n162.]\r\n\r\nLesions of the cardiac muscle were most marked in those of our\r\npatients who had been intemperate, and in whom fatty degeneration of\r\nthe viscera (chiefly liver and kidneys) was also found. They were most\r\nfully developed in cases where death occurred at a comparatively late\r\nperiod, while in some very severe cases, in which death occurred as\r\nearly as the fifth day, the cardiac fibre presented merely faintness\r\nof striation without actual granular degeneration.\r\n\r\nPonfick in particular notes that the great majority of the bodies he\r\nexamined were of persons who had been habitual drunkards.\r\n\r\nPericarditis is occasionally present, and is marked by the usual\r\nlesions. In a very severe case in which it contributed largely to the\r\nproduction of the fatal result it was associated with pneumonia. In\r\naddition to this, effusions of blood beneath the endocardium and\r\npericardium are not rare; and we have seen them quite large and\r\nnumerous in cases where the muscular fibre was firmly contracted and\r\nthe cavities contained quite firm decolorized clots.\r\n\r\nThus in our case No. 62, Series C., \"the heart was normal in size,\r\nwith no appearances of previous disease. There were numerous\r\necchymoses of both layers of the pericardium. The right cavities\r\ncontained large, firm, yellowish, fibrous clots, forming a cast of the\r\nupper part of the ventricle and of the auricle, and extending both\r\ninto the pulmonary artery and back into the veins, and so firm that by\r\ngentle traction a complete cast of these vessels was drawn out. The\r\nclot in the pulmonary artery was throughout firm, fibrous, and\r\nyellowish. There were numerous ecchymoses of the pleura and of the\r\nmucous membranes of the stomach and urinary bladder, hemorrhagic\r\ninfarctions in the kidneys and lungs, and granulo-fatty degeneration\r\nof the cardiac muscle.\" Death had occurred in this case about the\r\nclose of the third week, and was preceded by hematemesis and\r\nsuppression of urine. We must note in this connection the tendency to\r\nembolism that exists in this disease.\r\n\r\nEspecial interest attaches to the condition of the blood in relapsing\r\nfever. Usually it presents no abnormal appearance if drawn during\r\nlife, though in grave cases it may coagulate imperfectly. We have no\r\nknowledge of its minute chemical characters, save that in several\r\ncases where there was great diminution in the amount of urine, with\r\nuræmic symptoms, urea has been found in considerable amount in the\r\nblood (Murchison, p. 368). The red globules present no definite or\r\n{412} characteristic changes. In some of our examinations they\r\nappeared of light color and became crenated very quickly on exposure.\r\nOn the other hand, the white corpuscles have repeatedly been observed\r\nto be increased in number, at times considerably so (Cormack,\r\nThompson, Zuelzer, Carter, Boeckmann, and ourselves), though this\r\nchange is not regarded as constant or essential. It has, however, a\r\nvery great interest in connection with the characteristic lesions of\r\nthe spleen which will be described hereafter. In several cases we\r\nobserved that many white corpuscles were small and apparently\r\nimperfectly developed. Boeckmann[30] concludes that they increase in\r\nnumber during the febrile paroxysm, reaching their highest number at\r\nthe crisis, and then diminishing gradually to the normal. The red\r\nglobules are much decreased during the fever, and return to the normal\r\nslowly during convalescence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, Sept. 1881, p. 513.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes, various abnormal elements have been\r\nobserved more or less constantly. By far the most important of these\r\nis the spirillum or spirochete of Obermeier, which has been already\r\ncarefully described. In proportion as this organism has been carefully\r\nlooked for it has been found constantly, so that the evidence has\r\nbecome very strong in favor of its uniform presence in the blood of\r\nrelapsing-fever patients during the febrile stage of the disease.\r\n\r\nPonfick in 1874[31] called attention to the occurrence of large\r\ngranule-cells in the blood in this disease. They are found during life\r\nas well as after death, when they exist in largest proportion in the\r\nblood of the splenic, hepatic, and portal veins. Their shape is\r\nspherical, ovoid, or elongated; the basis of the cells is a delicate,\r\ntranslucent, albuminous substance; and the granules are of a fatty\r\nnature, as shown by the action of reagents. These cells have been\r\nfound by other observers, and the view is generally received that they\r\nare derived from the lymphoid elements of the spleen, and perhaps of\r\nother portions of the lymphatic system; and Carter, who has studied\r\nthem carefully, is inclined to think there is some connection between\r\nthem and the development of the spirillum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Centralbl. f. d. med. Wissensch._, 1874, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nPonfick also first described[32] certain other large,\r\nirregularly-shaped, pale, granular, nucleated cells, which occur in\r\nsmaller number in the blood in relapsing fever, and which he regarded\r\nas altered endothelium, derived from the lining of the blood-vessels,\r\nof the lymphatics, or of the lacunar spaces of the spleen.\r\nOccasionally these cells are found with such highly granular contents\r\nas to make them closely simulate the large granule-cells described\r\nabove. These results of Ponfick have been confirmed by other\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nIn several of our reports of examinations of blood there is mention\r\nmade of quite abundant, free granular matter--an appearance also\r\nobserved by Carter. Finally, the latter describes the occurrence of\r\nthread-like filaments and of short, rod-like bodies.\r\n\r\nThere are no characteristic lesions connected with the\r\ngastro-intestinal canal. The mucous membrane of the stomach may be\r\nnormal or merely injected, though where there has been much vomiting,\r\nand especially bloody vomiting, there is marked injection, and not\r\nrarely ecchymosis and submucous extravasations of blood, with\r\nsoftening of the membrane. {413} These extravasations are usually\r\nsmall, but Cormack reports a case where one-third of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach was the seat of ecchymosis and extravasation.\r\nIn one of our own cases the extravasations occupied an area of four\r\ninches square.\r\n\r\nThe small intestines exhibit patches of congestion or ecchymosis less\r\nfrequently than the stomach, though it is usual to find injection of\r\nthe mucous membrane, especially of the lower portion, in cases where\r\nthere has been diarrhoea. Carter, observing the disease in India,\r\nfound in one-half of all autopsies some amount of congestion,\r\nhemorrhage, or inflammation of the ileum. In two instances he found a\r\nlayer of diphtheritic deposit over the mucous membrane of the lower\r\npart of the ileum.\r\n\r\nThere are no special alterations of the solitary or agminated glands,\r\nand ulceration never occurs. Even in cases where the constitutional\r\ninfection is severe, whether diarrhoea has been present or not, it is\r\nnoteworthy that there is rarely any swelling of the solitary glands or\r\nPeyer's patches, such as is met with in many other acute specific\r\ndiseases. It was not present in any of our autopsies.\r\n\r\nThe large intestine in like manner exhibits no characteristic lesions.\r\nPatches of congestion and occasionally submucous ecchymoses may be\r\nobserved, and croupous exudation occurs here somewhat more frequently\r\nthan in the small intestine.\r\n\r\nWyss and Bock[33] speak of enlargement of the mesenteric and\r\nretroperitoneal glands as of frequent occurrence, but we did not\r\nobserve it, and Murchison states that these glands present no abnormal\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Op. cit._, p. 223.]\r\n\r\nAlterations of vascularity of the brain or its membranes are met with,\r\nbut they are variable and bear no definite relation to the precedent\r\nsymptoms. Ecchymoses of the membranes are occasionally observed, and\r\nin one of our cases extensive meningeal hemorrhage was found.\r\nMurchison reported a case in which embolism of the left femoral artery\r\noccurred, and subsequently of the left middle cerebral artery,\r\ninducing death. The suggestion may be hazarded that in some of the\r\ncases where there is severe delirium ending in stupor and death there\r\nhas been multiple capillary embolism of the cerebral vessels.\r\n\r\nThere is occasionally the evidence of catarrhal inflammation of the\r\nupper air-passages, and in some epidemics diphtheritic exudation in\r\nthe pharynx and larynx has been noted (Wyss and Bock); and Ponfick\r\nfound acute oedema of the glottis in a considerable proportion of the\r\nfatal cases at Berlin. The lesions of pleurisy are met with in a small\r\nproportion of cases; in our own autopsies this complication was more\r\nfrequent than in most epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe lungs may be normal, and Murchison concludes that they are more\r\nfrequently so than in typhus. Still, they often present congestion or\r\noedema, and subpleural ecchymoses, hemorrhagic infarctions, and\r\npneumonic consolidation are not rare. Lobar pneumonia was present in\r\n33 per cent. of our own autopsies, in 28 per cent. of Carter's, and in\r\n20 per cent. of those conducted by Ponfick. The inflammation usually\r\npresents the regular stages, and is associated with a moderate degree\r\nof plastic pleurisy; but occasionally, as in one of our cases, it\r\nterminates in gangrene. In the instance referred to there was an area\r\nof gangrene about three inches square and one inch in depth, involving\r\nthe pleura and a {414} superficial layer of lung on the antero-lateral\r\naspect of the left lower lobe. In another remarkable instance, already\r\nreferred to on account of the suppurative inflammation of one masseter\r\nmuscle, the lungs, which were stained yellow throughout, presented\r\nnumerous deep purplish patches, which on section altogether resembled\r\nthe secondary metastatic deposits of pyæmia, with yellowish softening\r\nor even puriform centres surrounded by a rim of purplish livid\r\ndiscoloration. Very numerous similar patches, varying from the size of\r\na pea to that of a hazel-nut, and presenting every stage of\r\ndevelopment, were found throughout both lungs. In a few instances we\r\nfound the lesions of chronic phthisis, which had, of course, existed\r\nbefore the attack of relapsing fever. The bronchial glands were found\r\nswollen and infiltrated in cases where inflammatory processes in the\r\nlungs have existed.\r\n\r\nMuch interest attaches to the state of the genito-urinary organs in\r\nrelapsing fever, but caution is required to distinguish lesions that\r\nhave existed prior to the attack from those properly referable to it.\r\n\r\nOwing to the intemperate and exposed lives of many of the patients,\r\nrenal lesions might reasonably be expected in no small proportion. The\r\ncomparative rarity of albuminuria (see p. 407), even in severe cases,\r\nis suggestive of the view that when it is present it may at least\r\nsometimes be due to pre-existing lesions aggravated by the acute\r\ninfectious process, and further that the extreme gravity generally\r\npresented by such cases may be in part due to the impaired condition\r\nof the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe morbid changes most frequently referable to the fever are moderate\r\nenlargement and congestion, occasionally very intense so that we find\r\nit described in our notes as deep blackish-purple or blue; ecchymoses\r\nof the capsule or of the mucous membrane of the pelvis; small\r\nhemorrhagic infarctions, usually in the cortex; and cloudy swelling of\r\nthe glandular cells. Less commonly are found hemorrhagic infarctions,\r\nor small embolic patches advanced to various stages of disintegration,\r\neven to the formation of small puriform collections. In quite rare\r\ncases the lesions of acute nephritis are present, while caution must\r\nbe used in interpreting other changes occasionally met with, such as\r\npallor with granulo-fatty degeneration or other advanced alterations\r\nof the glandular cells, or hyperplasia of the intertubular connective\r\ntissue, with or without contraction of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the bladder, as already mentioned, may present\r\necchymoses, or, more rarely, croupous exudation (Wyss and Bock). The\r\nurine contained may be bloody, or, as in one of our cases where there\r\nhad been total suppression of urine for over seventy-two hours before\r\ndeath, there may be but a small amount of almost pure blood,\r\ncontaining a few phosphate crystals, but no tube-casts. In this case\r\nthere were also ecchymoses of the bladder and of the pelvis of the\r\nkidneys, with intense congestion and numerous small hemorrhagic\r\ninfarctions of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe liver is constantly though variously affected. It is found\r\nenlarged in the great majority of cases, especially if death has\r\noccurred during the febrile stage. The ordinary degree of enlargement\r\nin our cases was from four to four and a half pounds, but in a few\r\ninstances the liver weighed one hundred or one hundred and two ounces,\r\nthough in most of these extreme cases the patients had been drunkards,\r\nand there was such advanced fatty alteration of the liver as to make\r\nit probable that the {415} organ had been diseased previously. These\r\nfigures correspond with the results of other observers.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, especially when death occurs early and during the\r\nfebrile stage, the capsule and substance of the liver are congested,\r\nat times intensely so; and when ecchymoses are found elsewhere they\r\nare apt to be present here also, appearing as purplish patches dotted\r\nover the capsule and extending into the superficial layer of hepatic\r\ntissue. Not rarely, however, the liver substance is paler than normal,\r\nand presents a yellowish tinge, apart from the decided yellowish\r\nstaining present in cases attended with jaundice. Carter describes a\r\npartial mottled paleness of the liver as having been frequently\r\nobserved in his cases, the circumscribed pale areas presenting a\r\ncorresponding localized degeneration of the cells, as though from some\r\nlocal interruption of circulation.\r\n\r\nCloudy swelling and fatty degeneration of the liver-cells are indeed\r\nvery often present, and in some epidemics with preponderance of\r\nbilious symptoms are constantly found (Ponfick). The degree of the\r\ncell-alteration varies from a slight granulo-fatty change to an\r\nadvanced fatty degeneration, even with a marked tendency, in rare\r\ncases, to disintegration of the cells, so as to produce lesions\r\nanalogous to those of acute yellow atrophy (St. Petersburg epidemic).\r\n\r\nThe whitish deposits described by Küttner as due to albuminous or\r\nfibrinous infiltration are probably referable to transformed\r\nhemorrhagic infarctions, and the minute puriform collections that have\r\nbeen observed at the centre of the acini (Wyss and Bock) may have been\r\nmetastatic in origin, or attributable to the disintegration of minute\r\nthrombi associated with irritative hyperplasia of the adjacent\r\nlymphoid elements. The consistence of the liver varies: when death\r\noccurs early and bilious symptoms have not been marked, it may be even\r\nfirmer than normal, but more frequently it is softer, and it may be\r\nrelaxed, flabby, and friable.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the bile-ducts is of great interest in view of the\r\nfrequency of jaundice as a symptom in relapsing fever, and most\r\nauthorities unite in saying that they present no lesions capable of\r\nexplaining it.\r\n\r\nThe gall-bladder is usually found full of dark bile, but there is no\r\nsuch degree of inspissation, except in rare instances, as could\r\ninterfere with its passage through the ducts. Murchison quotes the\r\nstatement of Peacock that in some instances the bile was thick and\r\nviscid, so as apparently to cause obstruction, but all observations\r\nagree in showing that this is exceptional. The mucous membranes of the\r\nlarger ducts may present evidences of slight catarrhal inflammation,\r\nbut in nearly all cases where they have been carefully examined, even\r\nwhen jaundice had been marked, they have been found patulous and free,\r\nso that the jaundice cannot be regarded as due to obstruction of the\r\nlarger ducts save in rare instances (Pastau). In further confirmation\r\nof this may be stated the fact that there is no want of bile in the\r\nduodenum and feces.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a careful consideration of the lesions of the\r\nsubstance of the liver will show that it would be most improbable that\r\nthe minute biliary ducts in the areas most affected should escape\r\nimplication. Münch, who investigated this subject carefully, found\r\nthat there was a catarrhal state of the fine bile-ducts in every case\r\nof relapsing fever with jaundice; and Litten found the smallest ducts\r\nplugged with bile-stained pellets of mucus. It would appear,\r\ntherefore, that in many cases at least {416} the jaundice is really\r\nobstructive in its origin, the seat of the obstruction being in the\r\ntoo-rarely examined minute bile-ducts, though further investigation of\r\nthis interesting question is required.\r\n\r\nThe clinical bearing of these conditions has been fully discussed in\r\nthe appropriate section.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the spleen are constant, and even more remarkable than\r\nthose in the liver. It is enlarged with rare exceptions, and\r\nespecially so if death has occurred during the febrile stage. Upon the\r\nsubsidence of the fever the spleen probably returns to its normal size\r\nmore rapidly than the liver. The more common extent of the enlargement\r\nin our own cases was from ten to eighteen ounces, though we found the\r\nspleen in one case weighing twenty-nine and a half ounces and in\r\nanother forty-four and a half ounces. In neither of the latter\r\ninstances was there any reason to suspect malarial complication. The\r\nmost extensive enlargement we have found recorded is sixty-eight\r\nounces in a case reported by Küttner.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Schmidt's Jahrb._, 1865, vol. cxxvi.]\r\n\r\nThere is usually a correspondence between the stage and extent of the\r\nsplenic and hepatic lesions, but this is not invariable, and one or\r\nthe other organ may present a far higher degree of enlargement or much\r\nmore intense interstitial changes. It may be mentioned, moreover, that\r\nin some unusual cases the lesions of the lungs, such as ecchymoses and\r\nhemorrhagic infarctions, may be disproportionately marked as compared\r\nwith those of either the liver or spleen.\r\n\r\nThe capsule of the spleen often presents a mottled look, with at times\r\nlarge purplish ecchymoses; it is apt to be more or less opaque, and\r\nlocal peritonitis, with thin layers of plastic exudation often forming\r\nfriable adhesions with the abdominal wall, may exist.\r\n\r\nIn one of our cases the capsule presented a small perforation or\r\nrupture, with an exudation of plastic lymph over an area of four by\r\nsix inches, and diffuse peritonitis, with effusion of bloody liquid\r\nwith shreds of lymph throughout the abdominal cavity. This fatal\r\ntermination is fortunately rare, but there are several other instances\r\non record. The splenic pulp may retain its consistency and firmness,\r\neven in cases that have run a long course; but more frequently it is\r\nsoftened, and may be almost diffluent. The pulp is often swollen, so\r\nthat when cut it projects above the section. The color is darker than\r\nnormal, and often is of a deep maroon color. This swelling is due to\r\nenlargement of the blood-vessels, associated with great increase of\r\nthe cellular elements of the pulp and with enlargement of the\r\nMalpighian corpuscles.\r\n\r\nWhen death occurred early in the disease we found these bodies grayish\r\nor grayish-yellow in color and of the size of hempseed, so that the\r\nsection very thickly studded with them closely resembled shad-roe, and\r\nthis stage of the lesion is frequently described in our notes as the\r\nshad-roe spleen. Subsequently, the Malpighian bodies enlarge still\r\nmore, and stand out above the section a line or more in diameter, and\r\nof a lighter color; not rarely, several of them come in contact, and\r\nthus form a considerable mass of irregular shape, resembling the\r\ninfarctions described below.[35] It is probable that central softening\r\nmay occur later in the {417} Malpighian bodies, though we are inclined\r\nto regard the puriform collections frequently found as chiefly due to\r\nthe disintegration of hemorrhagic infarctions or of embolic patches.\r\nOf these, hemorrhagic infarctions are by far the most common and\r\npresent the familiar appearances. They may be quite numerous,\r\nsuperficial, or deep-seated, and of variable shape and size. At first\r\ndark reddish, firm, and sharply separated from the surrounding pulp,\r\nthey grew reddish-yellow or yellowish later, softened in the centre,\r\nand eventually were transformed into puriform collections. Doubtless,\r\nin a large proportion of cases that recover such infarctions exist and\r\nare slowly absorbed. Ponfick has shown that these are venous\r\ninfarctions, the arterioles leading to them being patulous. True\r\narterial embolism does, however, occur, though much more rarely\r\n(Ponfick, Murchison), giving rise to firm, wedge-shaped infarctions at\r\nthe periphery of the spleen, which may undergo degenerative changes\r\nsimilar to those above described. The resulting abscesses may burst\r\ninto the peritoneum, pleura, lung, or bowel. The microscopic\r\nappearances have been most fully described by Ponfick, our own\r\ncomparatively meagre observations having accorded entirely with his\r\nsubsequent accurate description. The cells of the swollen pulp contain\r\nred blood-discs and pigment, and some present collections of bright\r\ngranules. The lymphoid cells of the Malpighian corpuscles are at first\r\nin a state of cloudy swelling with multiplication of their nuclei, and\r\nlater show marked granular fatty degeneration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Thus, Wyss and Bock describe \"multitudes of minute\r\nabscesses as large as poppy or hempseed, and containing a single drop\r\nof pus.\"]\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic glands present no lesions, and the pancreas is normal.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum is not affected as frequently as other serous membranes\r\nin this disease. Superficial ecchymoses are, however, quite common,\r\nespecially so over the solid viscera; and more rarely effusions of\r\nblood have been found in the subperitoneal connective tissue,\r\ninvolving the muscular or glandular tissues beneath. We have already\r\nmentioned (p. 406) the occasional occurrence of local peritonitis,\r\nmost frequently of the splenic capsule, and also the rare accident of\r\ndiffuse inflammation from rupture of the spleen.\r\n\r\nThe marrow of the bones was carefully examined by Ponfick, who first\r\ncalled attention to the presence of important changes in relapsing\r\nfever, which have since been confirmed by other observers. These\r\nchanges consist in proliferation and subsequent degeneration of the\r\nlymphoid cells of the marrow, with multiplication of the nuclei in the\r\nwalls of the minute vessels and fatty degeneration of their coats. As\r\na result of these changes, spots of puriform softening may form,\r\nchiefly in the cancellous tissue of the extremities of the long bones,\r\nwith the production of localized necrosis, and possibly with extension\r\nof inflammation to the neighboring articular cavity.\r\n\r\nConsiderable space has been devoted to the detailed consideration of\r\nthe pathological changes in relapsing fever, partly because we believe\r\nthe fact has not been sufficiently recognized that the disease is\r\nconstantly attended with important and characteristic lesions. These\r\nconsist, in brief, of remarkable changes in the blood; of widespread\r\necchymoses and infarctions, which not rarely undergo puriform\r\ndisintegration; of hyperplasia and subsequent degeneration of the\r\nMalpighian corpuscles of the spleen, with changes in the cellular\r\nelements of the splenic pulp; of cloudy swelling of the gland-cells of\r\nthe liver and kidneys, with a {418} marked tendency to fatty\r\ndegeneration; of changes in the marrow of the long bones; and,\r\nfinally, of granulo-fatty degeneration of the muscles, and especially\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS AND RELATION TO OTHER DISEASES.--The entire question of the\r\ndiagnosis of relapsing fever is dominated by that of spirillar\r\ninfection. Before Obermeier's discovery the differential diagnosis of\r\nthe initial paroxysm, and to a less extent that of the subsequent\r\nevents of a case of relapsing fever, was attended with considerable\r\ndifficulty. But if, as now seems established, immediately before and\r\nthroughout the initial paroxysm and subsequent relapses a\r\ncharacteristic spirillum is to be detected in the blood upon proper\r\nexamination, while it rapidly disappears after the crisis, it is\r\nevident that as soon as a suspicion is aroused as to the possible\r\npresence of relapsing fever the question may be settled conclusively\r\nby the microscope.\r\n\r\nNone the less is it important to consider carefully, but briefly, the\r\nsymptoms by which relapsing fever is to be distinguished from various\r\naffections which may simulate it, because even the most experienced\r\nobservers admit that the spirillum cannot be invariably detected;\r\nbecause it is not yet known that a similar organism may not be found\r\nin some other affections; and, finally, because on the outbreak of an\r\nepidemic of relapsing fever, especially in America, where its\r\noccurrence has hitherto been so rare, there is strong probability that\r\nthe nature of the early cases will not be even suspected until the\r\nrelapse occurs.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever often prevails in an epidemic form simultaneously with\r\nrelapsing fever, so that it was inevitable they should have been for a\r\ntime confused. Their essential non-identity is, however, now too well\r\nrecognized to require any lengthy demonstration. The following\r\nstatement of the heads of the argument may therefore suffice.\r\n\r\nIn typhus there is no characteristic spirillum, and the lesions which\r\nare truly characteristic of relapsing fever are totally wanting. There\r\nare convincing differences in the symptoms, course, and results of the\r\ntwo diseases. There is no evidence to show that when fever has been\r\nimported into a locality by a single case, typhus fever has ever\r\nproduced other than typhus, or relapsing other than relapsing fever.\r\nThe two diseases often prevail together, and may coexist in the same\r\nhouse, each preserving its own distinct characteristics; and persons\r\nexposed to the double contagion may contract one or the other, or\r\nfirst one and then the other at a shorter or longer interval, so that\r\nan attack of either exerts no protective power against the other. It\r\nmust be noted, however, that in a large majority of such cases of\r\nsuccessive contagion it is relapsing fever which has been followed by\r\ntyphus, while the reverse has been observed much more rarely.\r\n\r\nIn 1869-70 the two diseases were prevalent in Philadelphia, and the\r\nwards of the municipal hospitals constantly contained a considerable\r\nnumber of cases of both. Three instances came under our care in which\r\nafter recovery from relapsing fever the patient contracted typhus. All\r\nof these patients were employed as assistant nurses, and were\r\ncontinuously under observation from the early part of their attack of\r\nrelapsing fever to the end of the attack of typhus. In one case the\r\ninterval of health between the close of the relapse and the onset of\r\ntyphus was forty-four days; in the second it was thirteen days. In\r\nboth cases the original disease was {419} thoroughly characteristic\r\nand the subsequent attack of typhus was typical. In both death\r\nfollowed, and the post-mortem examination verified the above\r\nstatement. The third patient had severe relapsing fever, from which he\r\nrecovered and returned to work, though with pains in the legs,\r\nshoulders, and forehead. After an interval of apparent health of\r\neleven days he developed a well-marked attack of typhus, which\r\nterminated on the twelfth day in recovery. It may be added that\r\nalthough typhus is not of frequent occurrence in any portion of North\r\nAmerica, there have been a number of epidemics unattended with a\r\nsingle case presenting the features of relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nBetween well-marked cases of the two diseases there should be no\r\ndifficulty in making a prompt diagnosis. Relapsing fever is\r\ndistinguished from typhus clinically by the severity of the initial\r\nchill; the rapid elevation of the pulse and temperature; the\r\ncomparative infrequency and mildness of cerebral symptoms, despite the\r\nintense fever; the severity of the gastric symptoms, nausea and\r\nvomiting; the enlargement of the liver and spleen, with marked\r\nabdominal pain and soreness; the frequency of jaundice, of epistaxis,\r\nand of other hemorrhages, and of anæmic murmurs over the heart and\r\nlarge vessels; obstinate insomnia; vertigo; peculiar rheumatoid pains\r\nand perversions of sensation; the frequency of sweating during the\r\nhigh pyrexia; by the occurrence of crisis, subnormal temperature,\r\napyretic interval, and relapse; the rarity of measly eruption and of\r\nbed-sores; the frequency of pneumonia, diarrhoea, ophthalmia, oedema,\r\nand desquamation as complications and sequelæ; the usual occurrence of\r\nabortion in pregnant females; the protracted course of the disease,\r\nand its remarkably low mortality despite the severity of the symptoms,\r\nexcept in cases of complicated or typhoid type; and, finally, by the\r\nmodes in which death occurs. Of course to this must be added the\r\nspecific result of examination of the blood in relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nDoubt will arise only in very rare cases where a measly eruption\r\nappears on or before the fifth day of relapsing fever, with headache\r\nand mild delirium, but without severe gastric symptoms, epistaxis, or\r\njaundice. If no relapsing fever were prevalent at the time, such a\r\ncase might well be regarded as one of mild typhus until the crisis and\r\nthe relapse disclosed its real nature. But if the two diseases were\r\nknown to be prevalent in the community, examination of the blood would\r\nproperly be made at once and the diagnosis be established.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis between ordinary cases of relapsing fever and typhoid is\r\nreadily made by the gradual onset and peculiar course of the pyrexia\r\nin the latter disease, as well as by the frequency of delirium, of\r\nabdominal distension, and of diarrhoea, and by the characteristic\r\neruption. The occurrence of epistaxis, bronchial irritation, and\r\nsplenic enlargement is common to both, and an eruption of small\r\nrose-pink spots has been noted by some observers (Carter, pp. 194,\r\n317). But jaundice, enlargement of the liver, hypochondriac pain and\r\nsoreness, excessive nausea and vomiting, severe rheumatoid pains, and\r\nnumbness and tingling of the extremities, are very significant\r\nsymptoms of relapsing fever. Attention has already been called to the\r\ngrave type of relapsing fever in which the typhoid state is fully\r\ndeveloped, and to the fact that in such cases the pyrexia is often\r\nmodified, the onset less abrupt, the crisis imperfect, and the\r\ninterval occupied by an irregular post-critical {420} symptomatic\r\nfever. It is altogether probable that such cases have not rarely been\r\nregarded as of true typhoid character; and indeed the attempt has been\r\nmade by Griesinger to establish as a separate and independent\r\naffection, under the name of bilious typhoid fever, a group of cases\r\nwhich close examination seems to show to be chiefly composed of grave\r\ncomplicated relapsing fever with a certain proportion of true typhoid\r\nfever, complicated with jaundice.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the bilious typhoid type of relapsing fever is\r\nbased upon the history of the case; the mode of onset; the greater\r\nseverity of the pains, arthritic and abdominal; the early appearance\r\nand intensity of the jaundice; the more marked enlargement of the\r\nliver and spleen; the marked tendency to hemorrhages from various\r\nsurfaces; the peculiarities which careful study of the temperature\r\ncurve will show, especially about the time of crisis; the rarity of\r\neruption; the characteristic spirillum;[36] and the totally different\r\nanatomical lesions, which are, unfortunately, often demonstrable, as\r\nthis form of relapsing fever is fatal in from 33 to 50 per cent. of\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: As first demonstrated by Motschutkoffsky.]\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of the spirillar test for relapsing fever it may\r\nbe said that Griesinger's bilious typhoid must be stricken from\r\nmedical nosology as an independent affection.\r\n\r\nThe case of Charles Hood, on page 396, is a good example of the\r\nbilious typhoid form which occurred not rarely in the Philadelphia\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\nMurchison points out that, owing to the frequent occurrence of\r\njaundice in relapsing fever, this disease has been mistaken for yellow\r\nfever by such good observers as Graves, Stokes, and Cormack.\r\nDifficulty in diagnosis would be likely to arise only in regard to the\r\nbilious typhoid type of relapsing fever, and since its clinical\r\nhistory has become so well known, a mistake is not likely to occur.\r\nThe geographical distribution of the diseases is widely different.\r\nYellow fever is influenced powerfully by season and temperature, while\r\nrelapsing fever is independent of both. Negroes are but slightly\r\nliable to yellow fever, while relapsing fever attacks them with\r\nspecial violence. Yellow fever is not contagious, but infectious, and\r\nsecond attacks are extremely rare; relapsing fever is one of the most\r\ncontagious of the zymotic diseases, but one attack does not protect\r\nagainst a subsequent one. The mortality, the anatomical lesions, the\r\ncourse of the pyrexia, the leading clinical symptoms, are all widely\r\ndistinct in the two affections; and, finally, no spirillum has been\r\nfound in the blood in yellow fever. Yellow fever is an extremely fatal\r\ndisease; the ordinary form of relapsing fever has a mortality of 2 to\r\n10 per cent.; the bilious typhoid form, one of 33 to 50 per cent. In\r\nyellow fever the spleen is but slightly enlarged, and the liver is\r\npale and softened; in relapsing fever the liver and spleen are greatly\r\nenlarged, and there is great tenderness over the hypochondriac region.\r\nIn yellow fever albuminuria is much more common, and the urine more\r\nfrequently suppressed, than in relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nThe sudden onset, the severe headache and pains in the limbs, the\r\nvomiting, jaundice, epigastric tenderness, enlargement of the liver\r\nand spleen, occasional epistaxis, hematemesis, or hematuria, absence\r\nof characteristic eruption, liability to herpes facialis, pneumonia,\r\nand diarrhoea; the occasional occurrence of remissions in the pyrexia,\r\nand even of more or less fully-developed chills for several successive\r\ndays during the initial paroxysm or {421} the relapse, suffice to\r\nexplain the difficulty which may arise in distinguishing the bilious\r\nform of relapsing fever from bilious remittent fever. But the latter\r\ndisease arises exclusively from malaria, and is therefore powerfully\r\ninfluenced by season and locality; is not contagious; does not present\r\nanything approaching to the crisis, the apyretic interval, or the\r\nabrupt relapse of relapsing fever; presents pigmentary changes in the\r\nblood, instead of the spirillum; and lesions of the spleen and liver\r\ntotally unlike those characteristic of relapsing fever; can be\r\npromptly controlled by antiperiodic doses of quinine, and therefore\r\nshould have a mortality far less than that of the grave form of\r\nrelapsing fever. It is not necessary to pursue this subject further,\r\nbut a reference to the temperature charts of Carter[37] or of\r\nLitten[38] will show that in some epidemics single paroxysms\r\nresembling those of quotidian ague might occur during the interval\r\nbetween the initial paroxysm and the relapse, or a series of two,\r\nthree, or more such paroxysms of quotidian or tertian type might\r\nrepresent an entire relapse. Such phenomena are wholly uncontrollable\r\nby quinia, and are presumably dependent upon irregularities in the\r\nspecific infection, instead of upon a blending of malaria with the\r\npoison of relapsing fever. There is some ground for believing,\r\nhowever, that those who have recently passed through an attack of the\r\nlatter are highly, perhaps unusually, susceptible to malarial\r\ninfection, as we have already seen they are liable to contract typhus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Op. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Deut. Arch. f. klin. Med._, xlii. 1874.]\r\n\r\nThe chill, the sudden and high fever, the acid sweat, the high-colored\r\nurine, the intense pains and soreness, and the occasional murmur over\r\nthe heart, will in some cases of relapsing fever suggest the idea of\r\nsevere rheumatic fever, with illy-developed articular inflammation and\r\nwith a tendency to hyperpyrexia. The urgent danger presented by the\r\nlatter condition and the necessity for immediate recourse to cold\r\nbaths and large doses of quinine or of the salicylates, render it\r\nhighly important that no such error of diagnosis should be made. It\r\nwill usually be avoided readily by observing that in relapsing fever\r\nthere are great nausea, repeated vomiting, insomnia, peculiar\r\nformication of the extremities, jaundice, early enlargement of the\r\nliver and spleen, with abdominal pain and soreness, and a tendency to\r\nepistaxis; and, further, that despite the high temperature, cerebral\r\nsymptoms such as result from rheumatic hyperpyrexia are not\r\nthreatened, except in grave typhoid cases or just preceding the\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThe onset of relapsing fever may suggest forcibly the invasion period\r\nof small-pox, with its marked rigors, high fever, lumbar pain, aching\r\nin the head and limbs, nausea and vomiting, and if the patient is\r\nknown to have been exposed to the contagion of both diseases a\r\ndiagnosis would be impossible until the third day. But such a dilemma\r\ncan rarely occur, and under ordinary circumstances the patient's\r\nantecedents will enable a correct opinion to be formed.\r\n\r\nSevere cases of simple febricula with marked gastric disturbance may,\r\nas remarked by Jenner, closely simulate relapsing fever; and the same\r\nis true of attacks of acute gastro-hepatic catarrh, with severe\r\nheadache, sharp fever, cholæmic eye, epigastric tenderness, and\r\nfrequent vomiting. Of course there is no danger under ordinary\r\ncircumstances of these simple conditions being regarded as relapsing\r\nfever, but when the latter is prevalent in epidemic form it is\r\nprobable that the mistake is frequently made. {422} Although an\r\nimmediate diagnosis might be possible only by microscopic examination\r\nof the blood, the peculiar clinical symptoms of relapsing fever would\r\nsoon be found wanting, and suitable treatment would bring the simpler\r\naffection under control.\r\n\r\nAcute yellow atrophy of the liver occurs chiefly in pregnant women,\r\nthough it is also met with in men and children; but it is so rare that\r\nshould a case of it come under observation during the prevalence of\r\nrelapsing fever there is considerable danger that its nature would be\r\noverlooked. It resembles relapsing fever in the occurrence of jaundice\r\nand other signs of hepatic disorder, of delirium, and of a tendency to\r\nhemorrhage from various surfaces. The temperature, however, is more\r\nmoderate, and does not exhibit the sudden remission of relapsing\r\nfever; the liver is usually demonstrably diminished in size; severe\r\nnervous disturbances, such as convulsions followed by stupor and then\r\nby coma, are more constant; while the occurrence of spirilla in the\r\nblood of relapsing fever and of leucin and tyrosin in the urine of\r\nacute yellow atrophy serves to distinguish completely the two\r\ndiseases. Acute yellow atrophy is, moreover, invariably fatal.\r\n\r\nWith ordinary care there is but little danger that any of the local\r\ncomplications of relapsing fever will so absorb attention as to lead\r\nto a neglect of the specific general disease, so that the cerebral\r\nsymptoms should be readily distinguished from the onset of any acute\r\nintracranial affection; the parotitis which occasionally appears early\r\nin the disease should not be confounded with idiopathic mumps; and so\r\nfor other complications. There is far more danger, indeed, lest some\r\nof the complications may be overlooked; and this is especially true of\r\npneumonia, one of the most frequent and most important of them all.\r\nIts occurrence is the cause of the supervention of grave typhoid\r\nsymptoms or of the modification of the normal course of the pyrexia in\r\nso many cases that nothing but a systematic daily examination of the\r\nlungs will avert serious oversights.\r\n\r\nMORTALITY AND PROGNOSIS.--The rate of mortality has varied in\r\ndifferent epidemics from 2 or 3 to 24 per cent. Murchison shows that\r\nout of 2115 cases admitted to the London Fever Hospital during a\r\nperiod of twenty-two years, and embracing two distinct outbreaks, only\r\n39 proved fatal, making 1.84 per cent. mortality. Adding to these the\r\nresults of Scotch and Irish epidemics, a total of 18,859 cases, with\r\n761 deaths, is reached, giving the rate of mortality for Great Britain\r\nas 4.03 per cent. The great Indian epidemics studied by Carter gave\r\n111 deaths out of 616 cases, equal to 18.02 per cent. Recent German\r\nepidemics have given from 5 to 10 per cent. The above rates are\r\nobtained where all the cases observed during an epidemic are included.\r\nIf, however, the mortality of the ordinary form of relapsing fever is\r\ncomputed separately from that of the bilious typhoid form, it does not\r\nexceed 2 to 5 per cent., whilst the mortality of the latter form rises\r\nto from 33 to 50 per cent., or even higher.\r\n\r\nIn the Philadelphia epidemic, out of a total of 1174 cases there were,\r\nas nearly as can be ascertained, 169 deaths, giving a rate of\r\nmortality of 14.4 per cent. Taking all the cases admitted to the\r\nhospital under our observation, many of which entered at a late period\r\nof the disease and not a few when moribund, the mortality was not less\r\nthan 13 per cent. {423} The mortality among the negroes who were\r\nattacked with the disease was considerably greater than among the\r\nwhites. Finally, if the mortality of the bilious typhus form be\r\nconsidered separately--although from the frequency of jaundice in this\r\nepidemic and the numerous gradations of severity presented it is\r\ndifficult to form a sharply defined group of this character--it was\r\ncertainly not less than 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe date of death varies with the epidemic, the form of the disease,\r\nand the previous condition of vitality of those attacked. Ordinarily,\r\nby far the larger proportion of deaths occur during the first relapse\r\nor the second interval, but in bilious typhoid cases, presenting grave\r\ncomplications, especially pneumonia or severe hemorrhages at an early\r\ndate, or in cases occurring in intemperate subjects, or in those\r\npreviously in impaired health, the mortality is much heavier in the\r\ninitial paroxysm or the first interval than at later periods.\r\n\r\nYouth exerts the same favorable influences upon the result of\r\nrelapsing fever as it does in the case of typhus and typhoid.\r\nMurchison states that of 717 male patients under twenty-five years of\r\nage admitted into the London Fever Hospital, not one died, and in most\r\nepidemics similar, though not equally marked, results have been noted.\r\nIn some epidemics the mortality among young children has been\r\nconsiderable. As a rule, the percentage of deaths increases with each\r\ndecade after thirty years.\r\n\r\nSex does not exert any definite or constant influence upon the\r\nmortality. The number of males affected is far greater; they are\r\nliable to be exposed to the contagion in its most concentrated form; a\r\nlarger proportion of them are probably the subjects of intemperance\r\nthan in the case of females; and thus most statistics agree in making\r\nthe mortality somewhat greater in the male sex; but, all things being\r\nequal, there is no good reason for holding that sex itself has any\r\nvalue in determining the result.\r\n\r\nAs in other zymotic diseases, the mortality from relapsing fever is\r\nhighest during the early period of an epidemic, and the type of the\r\ndisease grows milder as the epidemic declines. Cases of the bilious\r\ntyphoid form have become notably less frequent during the later stages\r\nof some epidemics than at an earlier period.\r\n\r\nMarked difference has been observed also as to the action of remedies\r\nat different stages of epidemics, the early cases exhibiting an\r\nextraordinary resistance to remedies, and especially to anodynes,\r\nwhich passes away later. When typhus and relapsing fevers have\r\nprevailed together, and a clear discrimination between the two sets of\r\ncases has not been made, it has appeared that the mortality increased\r\nas the epidemic advanced, but this apparent exception has been due to\r\nthe fact that at first the cases of relapsing fever were in the\r\nmajority, while later those of typhus, the much more fatal disease,\r\npreponderated.\r\n\r\nEpidemics of relapsing fever prevail at all seasons, but more commonly\r\nthey are at their height during the colder months of the year. The\r\ntotal mortality will of course correspond, but the actual percentage\r\nis not constantly greater during any one season, although it is\r\nprobable that the greater liability to chest complications during the\r\ncolder months will render the disease more fatal then.\r\n\r\nThe gravity of relapsing fever has varied so greatly in different\r\nepidemics that it is very difficult to determine what influence upon\r\nthe mortality {424} has been exerted by mere difference of race. A\r\nfurther source of difficulty is found in estimating the differences in\r\nthe physical conditions of the poorer classes in the various\r\ncommunities affected. The mortality has been exceptionally high in the\r\nRussian and Indian epidemics and in some of the German ones, while in\r\nthe British epidemics it has uniformly been light. It is interesting\r\nto note that in the Philadelphia epidemic, where the great majority of\r\npatients were Irish or negroes, the mortality was high, over 14 per\r\ncent. The previous condition of the Irish patients must certainly have\r\ncontrasted favorably with that of the individuals attacked in the\r\nDublin and Belfast epidemics, so that the difference in result seems\r\nattributable only to a greater virulence of the disease. As an ample\r\nopportunity was here afforded to judge of the relative severity of\r\nrelapsing fever in the negro and white races when the cases occurred\r\nat the same season, at the same stage of the epidemic, and in\r\nindividuals living under nearly similar conditions, it may be stated\r\nthat the conclusion of all who studied the question closely was that\r\nthe disease was much more severe among negroes, and in particular that\r\nthey displayed a greater tendency to serious complications and to the\r\nbilious typhoid form.\r\n\r\nAlthough the degree and virulence of the infection undoubtedly\r\nconstitute the most important elements in determining the mortality,\r\nthe previous health and habits of those attacked with relapsing fever\r\nexert an influence upon the result. This is especially true of\r\nhabitual intemperance, which, by disposing to disease of the liver and\r\nkidneys, greatly increases the liability to a fatal result. It has\r\nbeen seen (page 409), however, that even when acute catarrhal\r\nnephritis existed at the time of the attack severe relapsing fever\r\nmight terminate favorably. Another observation which we made\r\nfrequently, and which coincides with what is well known in regard to\r\ntyphoid and typhus, is that improper exertion and exposure during the\r\nstage of incubation and immediately after the invasion produced a\r\nhighly unfavorable effect on the subsequent course of the disease, and\r\nseemed in particular to dispose to dangerous or fatal collapse at the\r\ncritical periods.\r\n\r\nApart from these general considerations, there are many special points\r\nto be considered in regard to the prognosis of relapsing fever:\r\n\r\nIf after the crisis of the invasion there is not rapid and decided\r\nimprovement, complications should be suspected.\r\n\r\nA sharp rebound of temperature quickly following crisis may be\r\nfollowed by speedy death.\r\n\r\nMere elevation of temperature during the invasion and the relapse,\r\neven though to an extreme height, is not attended with the danger\r\nwhich even a somewhat lower degree would indicate in other zymotic\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIncreased elevation toward the expected time of crisis should arouse\r\nanxiety, as sudden and dangerous cerebral symptoms may occur.\r\n\r\nProlonged duration of the pyrexia, or the substitution of irregular\r\ngradual defervescence (lysis) for the characteristic crisis often\r\nassociated with typhoid symptoms as are these conditions, is\r\nsignificant of complications and of danger.\r\n\r\nWild delirium during the pyrexia, or transient active delirium about\r\nthe time of crisis, is not necessarily unfavorable, but continuous low\r\ndelirium, with disposition to stupor, is associated with a typhoid\r\ntendency and is frequently followed by death. Excessive muscular {425}\r\ntremor or convulsions are highly unfavorable, but not necessarily\r\nfatal, symptoms.\r\n\r\nCardiac murmurs are not of serious import. The pulse is not usually as\r\nrapid in proportion to the temperature as in typhus or typhoid, and an\r\nexcessively rapid pulse toward the expected time of crisis, especially\r\nif associated with feebleness of the heart's action, points to the\r\ndanger of sudden collapse at or soon after that time. Previous cardiac\r\ndisease, especially fatty degeneration in habitually intemperate\r\npersons, increases this danger. Continued frequency of pulse after the\r\ncrisis indicates some complication or the danger of some accident.\r\n\r\nCough of a bronchial origin is not a specially unfavorable symptom,\r\nbut if associated with the physical signs of pneumonia and with marked\r\ndisturbance of respiration it indicates extreme danger.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis, even when copious, often occurs in favorable cases, but\r\nhemorrhage from the stomach or the kidneys is usually, though not\r\ninvariably, followed by death.\r\n\r\nAn eruption, measly or of pink spots, with or without minute petechiæ,\r\nis rare, and usually occurs in severe cases, but is not of specially\r\nunfavorable significance unless associated with the typhoid state or\r\nwith patches of purpura.\r\n\r\nHiccough is a much less unfavorable symptom in relapsing fever than in\r\ntyphoid or typhus, and vomiting, even frequent and persistent, may\r\noccur in cases of ordinary severity.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the liver and spleen indicates special risk only when\r\npersistent for some time after the relapse, in connection with\r\npersistent irregular fever. Jaundice has no necessarily unfavorable\r\nsignification, is frequent in ordinary cases in some epidemics, but\r\nwhen it is associated with the other features of the bilious typhoid\r\nform the danger is extreme, at least 33 per cent. of such cases\r\nproving fatal.\r\n\r\nSlight transient albuminuria may exist without special danger, but if\r\nassociated with evidences of catarrhal nephritis, or if extreme\r\ndiminution of urine, with or without albuminuria, exists, cerebral\r\nsymptoms are apt to ensue, with a high degree of danger.\r\n\r\nAll serious complications--parotitis, erysipelas, dysentery, abortion,\r\npneumonia, and, above all, peritonitis--greatly increase the risk.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to determine in what cases the relapse will fail to\r\noccur. Motschutkoffsky's statement, that when a slight post-critical\r\nrise occurs a relapse will follow, must be applicable only to a\r\nlimited number of cases.\r\n\r\nIn all cases at least one relapse must be expected; the patient in the\r\ninterval must be regarded as still sick, and after the close of the\r\nrelapse he must still be treated with rigid care until convalescence\r\nis permanently established. It must be remembered in hospital practice\r\nthat many patients enter toward or after the crisis of the first\r\nparoxysm, so that caution is needed in estimating the effect of\r\nremedies and the period of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe undue prominence of certain conditions during the course of the\r\ndisease is apt to be followed by corresponding sequelæ, and\r\nemaciation, anæmia, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dysentery, enlargement of\r\nthe spleen and rheumatoid pains may then be anticipated. The liability\r\nto ophthalmia and affections of the middle ear is not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n{426} CAUSES OF DEATH.--In fatal cases death occurs from exhaustion\r\ndependent on the protracted and severe sufferings of the patient; from\r\ncerebral symptoms; from hyperpyrexia; from the virulence of the\r\ntoxæmia; from uræmic poisoning; from sudden collapse; or from some\r\ncomplication, such as hemorrhagic meningitis, hemorrhages, pneumonia,\r\ndysentery, rupture of the spleen, peritonitis, or abortion.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--The indications for treatment presented by regular cases\r\nof relapsing fever seem to be--to moderate the pyrexia; to relieve\r\ndistressing symptoms, especially pain, insomnia, and gastric\r\nirritability; to sustain the strength of the system; to prevent or\r\nmodify the relapses; and to avoid complications and sequelæ.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to observe that until the nature of the specific cause\r\nof relapsing fever is fully determined, whether the spirillum occupy\r\nthat relation or not, it is impossible to direct our efforts\r\nrationally toward its neutralization or elimination. The various\r\nremedies which have been employed for these special purposes have no\r\nclinical support to recommend them. And while experiment has shown\r\nthat the activity of the spirillum is readily destroyed by the direct\r\naction of various weak solutions, as of quinine, carbolic acid,\r\niodine, and mineral acids, no special curative effect follows the\r\ninternal administration of these remedies, even in the largest doses\r\nconsistent with safety. In fact, there can scarcely be any disease in\r\nwhich treatment is less satisfactory or its results more difficult to\r\nestimate. The marked difference between various epidemics, and the\r\nwide variation presented by the development of individual symptoms in\r\ndifferent cases of the same epidemic, fully account for this.\r\n\r\nQuinine, as might be expected, has been largely used, in the hope that\r\nit might control the pyrexia or prevent the relapse. Murchison[39]\r\nquotes a considerable amount of evidence from various sources to show\r\nthat it does not possess either of these powers. It was administered\r\nto a considerable number of our cases, either in small and frequently\r\nrepeated doses during the pyrexia or the intermission, or else in\r\nlarge doses repeated several times in immediate anticipation of the\r\nexpected time of the relapse. Thus in some cases three grains of\r\nsulphate of quinia were given every two or three hours until tinnitus\r\nwas produced, and then this was maintained during the remainder of the\r\npyrexia and of the intermission. The amount given daily was from\r\nthirty to forty-two grains. It seemed to rather increase the\r\ndiscomfort in the head, and in some cases it aggravated the\r\nirritability of the stomach. The pyrexia was certainly not controlled\r\nby it. Given in the same manner during the intermission, it was\r\nusually well borne, but was not effectual in preventing the relapse.\r\nIt is true that in some cases the subsequent relapse seemed to be\r\nsomewhat modified.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Op. cit._, p. 408.]\r\n\r\nThus in one case 30 grains were given on the 6th of April; 39 grains\r\non the 7th; 39 grains on the 8th; 42 grains on the 9th; and 60 grains\r\non the 10th; the critical fall had occurred during the night of the\r\n7th, and the relapse began on the evening of the 9th, but the rise in\r\ntemperature was less abrupt than usual, and the relapse lasted less\r\nthan five days. It was quite severe, however, so that it is doubtful\r\nwhether the apparent modification was anything more than is frequently\r\nobserved in cases where no quinine has been administered.\r\n\r\nIn another case the fall in temperature at the end of the first\r\nparoxysm {427} was from 105.5° to 97° on March 26th: 35 to 40 grains\r\nof sulphate of quinine were given daily on April 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,\r\nand 8th; the temperature began to rise on the 3d, but the severe\r\npyrexia and the usual symptoms of the relapse were limited to a period\r\nof less than thirty-six hours. This is a less common irregularity, and\r\nyet does not afford sufficient evidence of the efficiency of quinine.\r\nIn other cases, however, as already stated, no appreciable effect\r\nfollowed its administration in this manner.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the other method of giving quinia, a case may be quoted\r\nin which 20-grain doses every three or four hours were given from\r\nApril 25th to April 29th, so that in four days 575 grains were taken.\r\nThe initial paroxysm was of average severity, and terminated at the\r\nend of the seventh day, April 20th. The quinine did not postpone the\r\nrelapse, which occurred on April 28th, but was of much less than the\r\nusual duration.\r\n\r\nIn no other case in which these large doses were given was there even\r\nas much reason as in the above instance to attribute to quinine any\r\npositive influence upon the course of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate that the failure of quinine was not dependent\r\nupon a want of absorption, Muirhead injected large amounts\r\nsubcutaneously with no better results.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be said that the evidence shows positively that\r\nquinine possesses no specific influence whatever upon relapsing fever;\r\nthat in only occasional cases, if at all, will even enormous doses\r\ngiven during the intermission postpone or modify the subsequent\r\nrelapse; and that it is not effective in reducing the temperature. In\r\nview, therefore, of the usual gastric irritability and tendency to\r\nvertigo and headache, which seem to be increased by large doses of\r\nquinine, and, further, in view of the small mortality, and of the fact\r\nthat when death occurs it usually comes from causes over which large\r\ndoses of quinine could exert no influence, it seems clear that this\r\ndrug should be prescribed only in tonic doses and only in cases where\r\nit is well tolerated by the stomach.\r\n\r\nArsenic was used in a considerable number of our cases with the view\r\nof determining if it possessed any power of relieving the severe pains\r\nor of influencing the relapse. It was administered in the form of\r\nFowler's solution (Liq. potassii arsenitis), and was given exclusively\r\nby the mouth. If given during the intermission, it was well borne in\r\ndoses of five to ten drops every four or even every three hours, given\r\nfreely diluted with water and immediately after food. In several cases\r\nit quickly induced puffiness about the eyes, but no effect whatever\r\nwas produced on the pains or on the succeeding relapse. In more than\r\none such case there was an unusually profuse crop of sudamina during\r\nthe relapse, many of the vesicles breaking and being followed by\r\nbrownish stains. When given during the pyrexia it aggravated the\r\nnausea and vomiting, so that it had to be suspended. In one\r\nunfortunate case, indeed, although promptly suspended, the arsenical\r\nsolution seemed to have assisted in the establishment of vomiting and\r\npurging, which proved uncontrollable and contributed greatly to the\r\nfatal result. Hypodermic injections of arsenic have been used\r\nconsiderably with no better results. There seems, therefore, to be no\r\nreason whatever for any further use of this drug in relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n{428} The high pyrexia and the severe rheumatoid pains have naturally\r\nsuggested the use of salicylic acid and the salicylate of soda. We\r\nwere not sufficiently aware of their antipyretic properties in 1869-70\r\nto have recourse to them, but in more recent epidemics Unterburger[40]\r\nand Riess[41] have found that large doses of the latter substance (one\r\nhundred grains or more daily) will reduce the temperature either in\r\nthe initial paroxysm or in the relapse, but that the disease is not\r\ncut short nor are the lesions of the blood or solids prevented.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Jahrb. f. Kinderheilk._, v. x., 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Deutsch. Med. Wochnsch._, Dec., 1879.]\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind here, as in connection with the action of\r\nquinine, that apparent modifications of the relapse are to be viewed\r\nwith great distrust, since such great irregularities therein naturally\r\npresent themselves. Care must further be taken lest such attempts to\r\nreduce the temperature aggravate the irritation of the stomach, and by\r\nlessening the power of taking food induce more serious exhaustion than\r\nwould have resulted from the unchecked pyrexia. The evidence in our\r\npossession is not sufficient to justify a positive decision as to the\r\ntherapeutic value of the salicylates in relapsing fever, but,\r\napparently, they are applicable to only a portion of the cases, and in\r\nthese are of but limited utility.\r\n\r\nThe same failure which has followed the use of quinine, of arsenic,\r\nand of salicin and the salicylates has attended the effort to prevent\r\nthe relapse by berberine, benzoate of soda, tincture of eucalyptus,\r\nand other reputed antiperiodics.\r\n\r\nDigitalis, veratrum viride, and aconite were used by us quite freely\r\nas antipyretics. The first two of these were often suspended on\r\naccount of the irritability of the stomach, and no valuable results\r\nfollowed their use when well tolerated. Aconite in small doses,\r\nfrequently repeated, as one drop every two hours, seemed to aid in\r\nallaying nausea and to exert some slight influence upon the fever. In\r\ncases where there was a distinct tendency to heart-failure, digitalis\r\nwas given freely with advantage.\r\n\r\nCold baths were not used to reduce the temperature in any of the cases\r\nunder our observation. They have been employed in other epidemics,\r\nbut, as far as we know, with no other effect than to cause merely\r\ntemporary lowering of temperature, without any decided relief to the\r\nother symptoms and without any apparent influence upon the course of\r\nthe disease. Frequent spongings with cool water and the application of\r\nice to the head gave only slight and temporary relief.\r\n\r\nSimple febrifuge remedies, such as effervescing draught or spirit of\r\nnitrous ether with solution of acetate of ammonium, were well received\r\nby the stomach, and appeared to promote perspiration and the more free\r\nsecretion of urine.\r\n\r\nFinding all our efforts to control the pyrexia so unsuccessful,\r\nrecourse was had in a large proportion of our cases to the\r\nhyposulphite of soda, given, dissolved in two ounces of water, in\r\ndoses of twenty grains every two or three hours. In two cases it\r\nseemed to increase nausea, and at times it caused some purging, but\r\notherwise it was well borne by the stomach, and, indeed, frequently\r\nappeared to aid in controlling vomiting. The records show that this\r\ndrug was given in only two or three of the fatal cases, so that\r\nalthough the patients who took it regularly presented every grade of\r\nseverity of the disease, they did well uniformly. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the hyposulphite of soda exerted no specific effect\r\n{429} upon the disease; it did not reduce temperature, it did not\r\nprevent or modify the relapses nor relieve the severe pains; it may\r\nhave promoted more free and healthy secretions, and, by tending to\r\nprevent vomiting, may have aided in maintaining nutrition; but, on the\r\nwhole, it may fairly be doubted whether this remedy merits any more\r\nextended trial.\r\n\r\nOne chief reason of the failure of antipyretics in relapsing fever is\r\nto be found in the existence of widespread irritative lesions of the\r\nglandular and mucous tissues, which combine with the specific\r\nblood-changes in causing and maintaining the high temperature. It is\r\nnot surprising, therefore, that the remedies which afford the greatest\r\nrelief in this disease are opiates and sedatives to the\r\ngastro-intestinal mucous membrane. Opium, or morphia, must indeed be\r\nregarded as the basis of the rational treatment of relapsing fever. It\r\nis called for by the insomnia, the severe headache and the pains in\r\nvarious parts of the body, the nausea and vomiting, and the pyrexia.\r\nIt does not appear to have been as prominent a feature in the\r\ntreatment of other epidemics as we found it necessary to make it in\r\nPhiladelphia. Parry[42] used it very freely, chiefly in the form of\r\nopium, by the mouth, and found a singular tolerance exhibited by his\r\npatients, several of whom took as large a dose as three grains every\r\ntwo hours during the afternoon and night without producing any sleep\r\nor even any contraction of the pupils. This resistance to the action\r\nof opium was observed chiefly in the early part of the epidemic, and\r\nwe may add that it was exhibited chiefly when opium was given by the\r\nmouth. When morphia was used hypodermically we found that one-fourth\r\nof a grain, given at intervals of six to twelve hours, afforded very\r\ngreat relief to the pains, aided and relieved vomiting, and often\r\ninduced quiet, refreshing sleep. Its use was not contraindicated by\r\njaundice, by cough or pulmonary congestion, or by moderate contraction\r\nof the pupils. It was frequently given so as to maintain decided\r\ndrowsiness throughout the pyrexia. When the pains persisted during the\r\nintermission the morphia was continued in smaller doses or at longer\r\nintervals. It occasionally happened that when patients were thus kept\r\ncontinuously under opium influence no relapse occurred; but here, as\r\nin regard to the action of quinine, it may safely be asserted either\r\nthat what was regarded as the initial paroxysm was in reality the\r\nrelapse, or else that the absence of a relapse was a mere\r\nirregularity, and in no way to be attributed to the action of the\r\nopium. On the other hand, in cases presenting a tendency to the\r\ntyphoid state, with a disposition to stupor, or where the urine was\r\nscanty and albuminous, no opiate was administered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that in our cases quinine in acid solution was\r\nfrequently ordered, and it answered very well to add to each dose of\r\nthis a suitable amount of morphia.\r\n\r\nAtropia, in the dose of gr. 1/60 to gr. 1/40, was usually associated\r\nwith the hypodermic injections of morphia. This was done particularly\r\nin cases where the pains were very severe, when the pupils were\r\ndisposed to be contracted, or when there was continued profuse\r\nsweating. In addition to this, atropia was continued without morphia\r\nduring the intermission in a few cases. The patients proved\r\nsusceptible to its influence, and dryness of the mouth with dilatation\r\nof the pupils was readily {430} produced by gr. 1/60 every six hours.\r\nIn one case gr. 1/40 every four hours for two days caused delirium,\r\nwith the usual symptoms of belladonna action, all of which passed away\r\nquickly after withdrawal of the drug. But in none of these cases was\r\nthe relapse influenced in the least.\r\n\r\nOther remedies may be used for the relief of the insomnia, which is\r\nalways one of the most distressing symptoms. Chloral and bromide of\r\npotassium have been found serviceable in various epidemics, and some\r\nobservers have preferred them to opium for the relief of headache and\r\ninsomnia. They did not prove reliable in the Philadelphia epidemic of\r\n1869-70. Bromide of potassium, even in large doses, produced scarcely\r\nany effect, and, while in a few cases chloral in doses of gr. xx. gave\r\npositive relief, in the majority of instances 40 grains failed to\r\ncause sleep or relieve suffering. It must not be forgotten also that,\r\nas there is a special tendency to cardiac failure in this affection,\r\nthe action of chloral must be closely watched.\r\n\r\nIn a small series of our cases where muscular pains, hyperæsthesia,\r\nand twitching were marked succus conii was given quite freely, but\r\nwithout any apparent benefit.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the stomach required attention in almost every case.\r\nNausea, vomiting, and epigastric and hypochondriac soreness were the\r\nprominent symptoms. Anorexia was usually complete during pyrexia, and\r\nnot rarely patients were admitted to the hospital who asserted that\r\nfor one or more days they had not taken any nourishment whatever.\r\nUnder such circumstances, and in a disease where the tendency to\r\nprostration and cardiac failure calls for stimulants and food, it is\r\nevident that strict care must be given to the diet. In many cases\r\nskimmed milk with lime-water, meat broths, arrowroot, or gruel, could\r\nbe taken in small amounts at short intervals, and retained. But\r\nwhenever these are rejected, no attempt should be made to persist in\r\ntheir use, but koumiss, whey, or chicken-water should be substituted,\r\nand continued until the stomach grows retentive. Equal care must be\r\npaid to the selection of a suitable form of stimulus. It may be proper\r\nto employ a mild and relaxing emetic if the patient be seen at the\r\nonset of the disease and if there is reason to suspect the presence of\r\nindigested food in the stomach, but under any other circumstances\r\nthere seems no reason for its use in a disease where vomiting is so\r\ncommon and gastric irritability one of the most troublesome symptoms.\r\nNor should purgatives be given save when very positive indications\r\nexist for their use.\r\n\r\nConstipation is rarely obstinate; the amount of nourishment taken is\r\nvery small; in a considerable proportion of cases there is diarrhoea,\r\nor at least a sensitive state of the bowels; and as a consequence it\r\nis preferable in nearly every case to dispense with laxatives\r\nentirely, and, if the bowels must be opened by assistance, to\r\nadminister a simple enema.\r\n\r\nWhen irritability of the stomach is marked, benefit may be derived\r\nfrom very small doses of calomel frequently repeated, as, for example,\r\ngr. 1/8 or 1/4 every one or two hours. Subnitrate of bismuth may be\r\nused in combination with this or as a substitute for it. In several\r\ninstances more prompt relief was obtained from nitrate of silver given\r\nin the dose of gr. 1/12 every three or four hours, dissolved in thin\r\nmucilage of acacia.\r\n\r\nStimulants were remarkably well borne, and their administration in\r\nsuch form as was acceptable to the stomach was clearly of service,\r\n{431} even from an early period of the disease. As a rule, whiskey was\r\nemployed, given in the form of milk punch. By carefully graduating the\r\namount of alcohol, and when necessary diluting the milk freely with\r\nlime-water, the stomach usually received it well. If circumstances\r\nfavored, dry champagne, or brandy or sherry in carbonated water would\r\noften prove preferable. The exhausting nature of the disease, the\r\nmarked tendency to cardiac failure, and the inability to digest an\r\nadequate amount of nourishment, all indicate the early use of\r\nstimulants. In cases where a tendency to the development of the\r\ntyphoid state existed alcohol was freely given, even to the extent of\r\nsixteen ounces of whiskey in twenty-four hours. Other stimulants were\r\nusually given in these cases, such as carbonate of ammonium,\r\nespecially if pulmonary congestion existed; turpentine, especially if\r\ntympany was marked; or Hoffmann's anodyne or spirit of chloroform, if\r\nmuscular twitchings, hiccough, or insomnia with wandering delirium\r\nwere prominent symptoms. In all cases of severity the use of tonics\r\nand stimulants should be maintained in reduced doses during the\r\nintermission and for some days after the final fall of temperature.\r\n\r\nIt remains to allude briefly to certain special remedies and to\r\ncertain symptoms requiring special treatment. Formerly, much diversity\r\nof opinion existed as to the propriety of venesection or local\r\ndepletion in relapsing fever, but Murchison concluded, after a careful\r\nexamination of the evidence, that it had not been shown to be of\r\nservice; and certainly the disease as it occurred in Philadelphia in\r\n1869-70 presented no indication whatever for even the mildest\r\ndepletory measures. This corresponds with the recognized plan of\r\ntreatment in all the specific fevers.\r\n\r\nBlisters are not so objectionable in relapsing fever as in either\r\ntyphus or typhoid, and there are several conditions in which they have\r\nbeen found decidedly useful. In cases where the headache has\r\nobstinately resisted cold applications, bromide of potassium, and\r\nopiates, a blister to the back of the neck has afforded marked relief,\r\nwith no unfavorable result. Again, in cases where the vomiting and\r\nepigastric distress were severe and obstinate the application of a\r\nblister three inches square to the epigastrium is to be recommended.\r\n\r\nChloroform has proved of value for the relief of various symptoms in\r\nrelapsing fever. As already stated, it was found the most useful\r\nremedy for the hiccough which was so troublesome in a number of our\r\ncases, and especially in those where jaundice was pronounced. It also\r\nseemed serviceable in controlling the peculiar chills which in varying\r\ndegrees of severity were present in a few cases, recurring at about\r\nthe same hour on successive days. These rigors or chills were\r\nuninfluenced by very large doses of quinine or other antiperiodics,\r\nbut were apparently controlled by full doses of chloroform given in\r\nadvance of the expected hour of recurrence.\r\n\r\nJaundice, which, as has been stated, is partly of hæmic origin, but is\r\nprobably also due in part to obstruction from catarrhal swelling of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the bile-ducts, is not influenced by mineral\r\nacids, and still less should mercurials or purgatives be administered\r\nfor its relief. It would seem proper, in cases where this symptom is\r\nmarked, to observe special care in diet and the use of stimulants, and\r\nto employ local sedative {432} astringents, such as small doses of\r\nnitrate of silver combined with opium and belladonna.\r\n\r\nMuscular soreness, pains, and tremor may call for special treatment on\r\naccount of their severity. The only remedy which has proved useful in\r\nrelieving the first two of these symptoms is opium, conjoined with the\r\nexternal use of anodynes. Iodide of potassium fails even in doses as\r\nlarge as can be borne, and the same is true of muriate of ammonium and\r\ncimicifuga, which we used thoroughly without any effect. In the\r\nmuscular pains, however, which torment the patient during\r\nconvalescence, the ammoniated tincture of guaiacum was found of\r\nservice. Atropia hypodermically and chloroform internally have been\r\nfound useful for the relief of severe muscular twitchings.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, therefore, it will be seen that in ordinary cases a\r\nsupporting and expectant plan of treatment is all that is required.\r\nAbandoning the idea of forcibly controlling the fever or of preventing\r\nthe relapse, care should be given in the first place to the diet and\r\nto judicious stimulation.\r\n\r\nOpium or morphia should be used to control pain, excitement, and\r\ninsomnia, aided, as far as the latter is concerned, by bromide of\r\npotassium or the cautious use of chloral. Cooling drinks should be\r\nallowed, cool applications made to the head, and the body should be\r\nrepeatedly sponged with cooling and disinfecting lotions. If the\r\nstomach is retentive, quinine in moderate doses may be given in acid\r\nsolution, alternating with a simple fever mixture; but if nausea and\r\nvomiting are present, the first purpose will be to allay them by the\r\nappropriate measures already discussed.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis is a frequent symptom, but usually requires no special\r\nattention. Occasionally it is profuse, and then should be promptly\r\nchecked, since serious exhaustion may follow its continuance. If,\r\ntherefore, mild astringent applications do not arrest it, recourse\r\nmust be had to the tampon saturated with diluted Monsell's solution.\r\n\r\nThe urine must be closely watched and frequently analyzed in relapsing\r\nfever. In some epidemics serious alterations in this secretion are\r\nrare; in others it is not uncommon for the urine to be scanty, and to\r\ncontain albumen or blood. When this latter condition is presented,\r\nespecially if at the same time uræmic symptoms exist, dry cups should\r\nbe applied over the kidneys, to be followed by the use of dry heat,\r\nand free perspiration should be promoted by hot-air baths or by the\r\nhot wet pack. It is probable that jaborandi given in repeated small\r\ndoses, so as to avoid any depressing effect on the heart, will be\r\nfound valuable in such cases. Infusion of digitalis, with spirit of\r\nnitrous ether or with acetate of potassium, may also be used with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAbsolute rest must be insisted on throughout the entire period of\r\nparoxysm and relapse. The records of every epidemic present instances\r\nof sudden death from cardiac syncope following trifling exertions. The\r\npatients should therefore be kept strictly quiet in bed from the\r\ninitial rigor until their strength is fully restored after the\r\nrelapse. As the danger of collapse is especially great at the time of\r\nthe critical fall in temperature, the patient should be closely\r\nwatched as the end of the initial paroxysm and of the relapse\r\napproaches. If there is any sudden rise of temperature, with head\r\nsymptoms due to hyperpyrexia, large doses {433} of quinine, ice to the\r\nhead, cold spraying, or the cold bath must be promptly used. As\r\nsweating begins the body must be covered with a warm blanket and warm\r\nstimulating drinks be administered. If any marked tendency to collapse\r\nis observed, the subcutaneous injection of strychnia or of ether and\r\ndigitalis, conjoined with diffusible stimulants internally and hot\r\napplications externally, are to be employed immediately. The special\r\nremedies required for the various complications and sequelæ have\r\nalready been sufficiently indicated.\r\n\r\nI desire in conclusion to acknowledge the important assistance\r\nreceived from Drs. Geo. S. Gerhard, Louis Starr, Charles Shaffner, and\r\nR. G. Curtin, who, under the supervision of my colleague, the late Dr.\r\nEdward Rhoads, and myself, recorded the histories of most of the cases\r\nwhich serve as the basis of this article, and also tabulated them for\r\nstatistical purposes.[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Reference must also be made to the interesting\r\nobservations on spirilla published by Mülhaüser in _Virchow's Archiv_\r\nfor July 9, 1884, after this article had been printed.

Originating probably in China, India, and the adjacent\r\ncountries of the Asiatic continent, its extension over Europe and\r\nAmerica was, without question, in the line of progress pursued by the\r\nadvancing centres of traffic and population. The earliest traces of\r\nits ravages can be dimly recognized in the descriptions of writers in\r\nthe middle and latter parts of the sixth century. In the early years\r\nof the tenth century, however, a remarkably accurate picture of the\r\ndisease was drawn by Rhazes, a physician of Bagdad. His treatise,\r\ntranslated by Greenhill for the London Pathological Society,[1] sets\r\nforth the views of an Egyptian physician named Ahron, who wrote in the\r\nsixth century. After these dates the remarkable political and social\r\nchanges in Europe, which are to be attributed either directly or\r\nremotely to the Crusades, contributed largely to the opportunities for\r\nthe spread of the disease and to the occurrence later of those\r\ndecimating epidemics which became veritable scourges. In the last\r\ncentury the resulting mortality in some of the countries of Europe was\r\noften equal to the entire population of one of their largest cities.\r\nIf a modern traveller could find himself transported to the streets of\r\nthe city of London as they appeared in the early part of the present\r\ncentury, it is probable that no peculiarities of architecture, dress,\r\nor behavior would be to him so strikingly conspicuous as the enormous\r\nnumber of pock-marked visages he would encounter among the people at\r\nevery turn. In the face of all cavil and sophistry, medical science\r\nwill always count among its greatest triumphs the modifications which\r\nvariola has undergone since its preventive treatment was established\r\nupon a satisfactory basis by the discovery of the immortal Jenner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _A Treatise on the Small-pox and Measles_, by Abu Becr\r\nMohammed Ibn Zacaríyá Arrází, London, 1848.]\r\n\r\n{435} The bibliography of the disease is extensive, and the list of\r\nauthors contributing to the subject is enriched by the names of such\r\nmen as Boerhaave, Van Swieten, Sauvages, Willan, E. Wagner, Johanny\r\nRendu, Hebra, and, more lately, Kaposi.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Respecting the etiology of variola, it can scarcely be\r\naffirmed that our knowledge has been greatly extended since the date\r\nof the experiments of Jenner. There is no historical knowledge of its\r\ngeneration de novo; and the earliest cases of the malady must\r\ntherefore be classed with the exceedingly rare instances of\r\nspontaneous cow-pox which have proved such a boon to the\r\nvaccini-culturists. To-day every case of small-pox is justly regarded\r\nas having been directly or indirectly transmitted from one or more\r\nindividuals affected with a similar disorder. It is thus recognized as\r\nspecifically infectious, contagious, and inoculable, its transmission\r\noccurring, first, without contact, by atmospheric conduction of a\r\nvolatile contagious principle of unknown nature; second, with contact\r\neither by (_a_) actual transference of dry or moist infectious\r\nsecretions deposited upon a susceptible surface, immediately or\r\nthrough the medium of garments, bed-clothing, paper money, and similar\r\nmaterial substances; or (_b_) by inoculation of unprotected persons\r\nwith the pathological product of an infected organism. There is no\r\ndoubt but that the contagious principle displays its greatest\r\nactivities in connection with the contents of the lesions undergoing a\r\nchange from the vesicular to the pustular phases, though from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the disease it is probable that all the\r\ntissues and fluids of the infected body are in various degrees capable\r\nof producing the malady in those who are unprotected. Furthermore,\r\nwhether associated or not with an organic substance, the contagium of\r\nthe disease is known to preserve the power of reproducing itself for a\r\nperiod lasting for weeks, months, and even a longer time. A field for\r\nits activities once secured, there is a period of time during which\r\nfew if any evidences of its progress are declared, this period being\r\nabruptly terminated by distinct and characteristic symptoms. This is\r\nknown as the period of incubation.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the contagium in small-pox has been the subject of much\r\nspeculation, careful investigation, and experiment, the results having\r\nestablished but few facts of any practical value. There is at present\r\nno proof that any bacteria, vegetable germs, or other minute organisms\r\nforeign to the human body are the essential causes of the disease. It\r\nis certain that in health the human body is completely enveloped in a\r\nvolatile medium emanating from the secretions of the glands of the\r\nskin, which can be recognized by some of the keen-scented lower\r\nanimals when it is wafted through the air at a distance of several\r\nhundred feet from a single individual. It is reasonable to conclude\r\nthat not only in small-pox, but in other contagious and infectious\r\ndiseases, these emanations possess a pathological character, and\r\nbecome capable of transmitting such maladies from diseased to healthy\r\norganisms. Certain also it is that when the subjects of these diseases\r\nare crowded together, as in prisons, hospitals and camps, this\r\ncontagious element gathers an unwonted intensity. By far the larger\r\nnumber of all transmissions of variola occur after inhalation of the\r\ninfective medium--in other words, by the avenue of the lungs. It is\r\nprobably for the same reason that the disease spreads more widely and\r\nwith greater virulence during the cold seasons of the {436} year, in\r\nthis latitude especially from December to February--a time when the\r\nventilation of inhabited dwelling-houses is usually much less perfect\r\nthan in warmer weather.\r\n\r\nThe disease affects individuals of all ages and both sexes, not\r\nsparing the foetus in utero, and, in the case of the latter, occurring\r\nboth with and without previous infection of the mother of the unborn\r\nchild. Nowhere are its ravages so extensive and followed by such fatal\r\nresults as among those who have long been unprotected by previous\r\nvaccination. Among the debilitated, as also among the very young and\r\nthe very old, small-pox is liable to be followed by severe\r\ncomplications and a fatal result. Negroes, possibly in consequence of\r\ntendencies inherited through generations of unvaccinated ancestors,\r\nare particularly prone to the disease. Lastly, there is occasionally\r\nnoted an individual idiosyncrasy, in consequence of which either a\r\nremarkable susceptibility to the disease exists or a no less singular\r\nimmunity against its encroachment is conferred.\r\n\r\nThus, physicians, much exposed to its influences in the discharge of\r\ntheir professional duties, are known to be relatively exempt, while\r\nother individuals, few in number it must be admitted, have either had\r\nrepeated attacks of the malady itself, or, after each exposure to its\r\ncontagious principle, a recurrent illness of variable type. In the\r\nimmense majority of all cases, however, one attack confers immunity\r\nupon the sufferer against subsequent invasion of the disease for the\r\nremainder of life. Upon a few occasions I have known variola to occur\r\nin individuals previously affected with cutaneous diseases, especially\r\nthe eczematous--a fact which merely suggests that such pre-existing\r\ndisorder of the integument conferred no immunity against infection.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The earliest symptoms of small-pox may be\r\noccasionally recognized during the stage of incubation, which, as\r\ndescribed above, embraces a period of from ten to fifteen days, though\r\nthese limits are not absolutely fixed, since both shorter and longer\r\nincubative periods have been at times established. During the interval\r\nthe patient may appear to enjoy perfect health, or, on the other hand,\r\nsuffer from an ill-defined malaise, with anorexia, languor, insomnia,\r\nand allied symptoms. Close observation of the patient thus affected\r\nwill often reveal the existence of a peculiar pallor of the face,\r\naccompanied by a skin-color which suggests a slight degree of\r\nsallowness of the complexion. These rather indeterminate symptoms are\r\nnaturally most marked toward the completion of the period of\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\nThe latter terminated, the period of invasion follows, and extends\r\nfrom the conclusion of the incubative stage to the moment when the\r\nfirst cutaneous lesions of variola appear upon the surface. The\r\nsymptoms which characterize the onset of this period of invasion are\r\nconspicuous and characteristic. There is often a sharp vespertine\r\nrigor or a more or less continuous chilliness, accompanied by\r\nsensations of \"creeping\" over the surface, lasting even for several\r\nhours. Meantime, the temperature rises to 103° or 105° F., the pulse\r\nrunning up to 120 or 130 beats per minute. In this febrile condition\r\nthere is commonly complaint of a characteristic aching in the head and\r\nback, intense, scarcely intermittent, and so peculiar as to have\r\nfrequently furnished a clue to the diagnosis of the approaching\r\nmalady. These sensations are quite analogous to the substernal and\r\nother pains which frequently precede the first explosions {437} of\r\nsyphilis, and are all, without question, due to the circulation of a\r\npoisoned blood, the influence of which is in this manner confessed by\r\nthe nervous system. In the case of infants and young children the\r\ninvasion of small-pox is frequently ushered in by delirium and\r\nconvulsions--symptoms which are to be explained by the facts just\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThis complexus of febrile and nervous symptoms, varying somewhat in\r\nintensity and possibly interrupted by sensations of chilliness, may be\r\nrecognized as continuing on the second and third days of the period of\r\ninvasion. Meantime, there may be noted a dusky hyperæmia of the\r\npharynx and tonsils, the surface of which may even display elevated\r\npoints which develop later into papules. In exceptional instances the\r\nintensity of the poison is such that the system fails to rally before\r\nthe violence of the onset, and a fatal result ensues before the\r\ncharacteristic exanthem appears upon the skin.\r\n\r\nOn the second and third days of the invasion stage of the disease, if\r\nthey are displayed at all, the variolous rashes appear. Too much\r\nattention can scarcely be paid to the importance of their recognition\r\non the part of the diagnostician. Often indeed have practitioners been\r\ndeceived by their occurrence, having been either completely blinded to\r\nthe serious nature of the malady in progress, or, as Bartholow[2] has\r\nwell shown, having supposed that they were dealing with a concurrence\r\nof variola and scarlatina or rubeola.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"The Variolous Diseases,\" _Med. News_, Mar. 4, 1882, p.\r\n232.]\r\n\r\nHebra was the first to point out the significance of the rash known as\r\nroseola variolosa or erythema variolosa. Occurring at about the dates\r\nnamed above, it is in a few patients pronounced and vivid, even in\r\nsolitary instances rivalling in severity the exanthem which succeeds\r\nit. In others, the majority of all patients in some epidemics, it may\r\nbe entirely wanting. The writer has certainly observed its most\r\ntypical development in women who were either menstruating or in the\r\npuerperal state. It is said also to be relatively frequent in subjects\r\nof a tender age. Kaposi[3] has recognized it in all its manifestations\r\nat every age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Consult the admirable chapter on variola in his treatise,\r\n_Path. u. Therap. der Hautkrankt_, Wien, 1882.]\r\n\r\nIt appears in the form of puncta, striæ, or diffuse and uniform\r\nblushes covering extensive areas of the integument, livid red,\r\npurplish, or brownish-red in hue, paling under pressure, but never\r\nleaving upon the skin over which the finger-nail is quickly drawn the\r\ncharacteristic whitish streak by which many practitioners test the\r\nscarlatinal rash. The surfaces involved may be either not raised or\r\nslightly elevated above the general level of the skin, and are usually\r\ncircumscribed. The regions chiefly involved have been carefully\r\ndescribed by Th. Simon, and are hence sometimes called Simon's\r\ntriangles. Thus the groin, the internal face of the thighs, and the\r\nhypogastric region may be involved at once (femoral triangle of\r\nSimon); the surface of the axilla, the pectoral region, and the inner\r\nface of the arm (brachial triangle of Simon), as also the extensor\r\nfaces of the knees and the elbows, the dorsum of the feet, and indeed\r\nevery portion of the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these rash-covered areas may also appear petechial or\r\nhemorrhagic, dark-red, pin-head to bean-sized maculæ, which undergo\r\ncolor-changes both in lighter and deeper shades as the invasion period\r\n{438} lapses. In lieu of these, however, transient wheals may come and\r\ngo over the surface, and even the erythema described above may assume\r\nan erratic phase and appear in one part only to disappear and recur at\r\nanother. None of these flash-light warnings of the oncoming exanthem\r\nare proportioned to the latter in the matter of extent and intensity\r\nof development. They may be followed by grave or mild manifestations\r\nof the disease. The subsequent eruption may also be much more\r\nabundantly developed in regions where the invasion rashes have not\r\nappeared, and the latter completely fade before the former have\r\nadvanced to occupy the field thus deserted.\r\n\r\nThe invasion stage of variola commonly occupies three days. Rarely it\r\nextends into the fourth, fifth, and even the sixth, day after the\r\npremonitory chill and fever.\r\n\r\nUpon its subsidence the exanthem of the disease as a rule promptly\r\nappears. Simultaneously, the temperature abates, the rapidity of the\r\npulse diminishes, and there is marked amelioration of the general\r\nsymptoms. The patient, frequently deceived by the completeness of this\r\ndefervescence, is apt to conclude that he is convalescent from his\r\ndisorder, and is thus often astonished at the discovery of the\r\nexanthem upon the person, usually the face. In other cases, more\r\ncommonly those of a grave character, there is failure of this\r\ndefervescence, the febrile symptoms continuing or even increasing in\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nThe eruption first appears in the form of pin-head sized and larger,\r\nfirm, conical, discrete, coherent or confluent, reddish papules,\r\nsometimes accompanied by mild sensations of a pricking or painful\r\ncharacter, often exciting no subjective symptoms by which their\r\npresence could be declared. To the touch they are characteristically\r\nindurated, and suggest the hardness of small shot imbedded in the\r\nskin. They appear first and in greatest abundance upon the face and\r\nscalp, involving later and progressively the trunk, the extremities,\r\nand the palmar and plantar surfaces. It is at this moment that the\r\neruption most resembles that to be recognized in measles (the\r\ndistinction between the eruptive symptoms of the two diseases will be\r\nconsidered later). At times a reddish areola surrounds each lesion,\r\nespecially those appearing upon the trunk. All are situated about the\r\norifices of the follicles and glands of the skin.\r\n\r\nOn the first and second days of the eruption the papular lesions\r\nmultiply in number, involve an increasingly large area, and\r\nindividually augment in size; so they appear first upon the head, and\r\nare successively presented to the eye upon the lower portions of the\r\nbody. The older lesions are usually recognized upon the scalp, face,\r\nneck, and shoulders; the more recent upon the extremities. By the\r\nthird day of the eruptive stage there is usually evident at the apex\r\nof the older lesions a minute vesicle containing a drop of pellucid\r\nserum, which rapidly changes in character and size till a distinct\r\nvesicle is formed with cloudy or lactescent contents. Early in their\r\ncareer an apicial depression can be seen, which later deepens into a\r\ncharacteristic umbilication. This umbilication in the vesicular stage\r\nis somewhat peculiar. It is more than a mere depression of the summit,\r\nsuch as might be made by thrusting a blunt-pointed pin centrally and\r\ndownward so as to carry the roof-wall before it. It is made clinically\r\nmost distinct by the fluting or puckering of the peripheral part of\r\nthe roof-wall, giving the lesion a crenated appearance which is not\r\n{439} assumed by any other cutaneous efflorescence of multiple\r\ndevelopment. It may be regarded as pathognomonic of variola.\r\n\r\nThe pock is usually mature by the sixth day of the eruption. It is\r\npea-sized and globular in shape; its umbilication has been usually\r\nquite removed by the complete filling of its chamber with distinctly\r\npurulent contents; it is often surrounded by a halo due to hyperæmia\r\nor exudation; and, the total number of individual lesions being then\r\nfairly determined, it is often closely set against its fellows, islets\r\nof unaffected integument having meantime become fewer and more\r\ncontracted. The face, covered with this eruption, then exhibits a\r\ntypical aspect. The entire integument becomes swollen and brawny or\r\noedematous. The eyes are thus closed by the tumid lids, which are\r\nseparable with difficulty, and this, too, even though they be the seat\r\nof comparatively few lesions. The nose, lips, cheeks, and ears are by\r\nsimilar processes deformed and given a most repulsive unsightliness.\r\nMucus and puriform secretions gather and dry about the mucous outlets.\r\nThe skin of other parts of the body (hands, feet, genitalia, and the\r\nentire extremities) is in a similar condition, merely most noticeable\r\nin the exposed and disfigured visage.\r\n\r\nThe fever of maturation or suppuration, or, as it is often called, the\r\nsecondary fever, is lighted to activity with the onset of the\r\nsuppurative process. The temperature rises to a point ranging between\r\n101° and 105° F., the pulse-rate simultaneously rising to 100 and even\r\n150 in the minute, varying of course with the age of the patient and\r\nthe severity of the attack. During its continuance, from the eighth or\r\nninth to the eleventh or twelfth day of the disease, the victim of the\r\nmalady is in a deplorable and critical condition. The intense grade of\r\ncutaneous inflammation, with its resulting subjective sensations of\r\nburning pain and tension, the soreness of the mouth (tongue, pharynx,\r\ninside of lips, and palate), due to the existence of pus-filled pocks\r\nupon the buccal membrane, and, for similar reasons, the dysphagia and\r\nirritation of the larynx and tracheal membrane, are all sufficient to\r\naccount for the general condition. In cases of mild grade the patient\r\nlies conscious, but in a stolid apathy, listlessly accepting the\r\nservices of his attendants. In others there is delirium of low or high\r\ngrade, often sufficient to demand constant surveillance, lest in\r\nconsequence the patient do serious injury to himself.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the pustules which appear upon the mucous surfaces\r\naccessible to the eye is modified somewhat by the heat, moisture, and\r\nfriction to which these surfaces are exposed. Typical, fully-distended\r\npustules occasionally persist upon the soft palate and the inside of\r\nthe lips. Soon, however, the macerated roof-wall yields, leaving a\r\nreddish floor where the mucous membrane is exposed, denuded of its\r\nepithelial layer or covered with a new tender and hyperæmic pellicle.\r\nIn grave and severe cases these pustular lesions may extend deeply\r\ninto the mucous tracts, involving the trachea, bronchi, or alimentary\r\ncanal. In an autopsy made by the writer on the body of a male subject\r\ndead of unmodified variola, there was no portion of the alimentary\r\ncanal from the mouth to the anus which was not studded by thickly-set\r\npustules. The urethra, vagina, vulva, external auditory canal, and\r\nconjunctivæ are, in severe cases, similarly involved. According to\r\nKaposi, the tympanum is usually exempt.\r\n\r\nThe period of desiccation begins usually on the thirteenth or\r\nfourteenth {440} day of the disease, and, according to the severity of\r\nthe previous pathological processes, requires for its completion from\r\none week to a fortnight. Its onset is characterized by a second marked\r\nbut gradually developed defervescence. With a diurnal temperature\r\nsuccessively less elevated above the normal standard there is a\r\ncorresponding fall of the pulse-rate. As the disease has by this date\r\ntaxed the vital resources of the system to the utmost limit, the\r\nexhaustion resulting may be declared by a pulse which is flagging,\r\nweak, and even in the matter of frequency much below the standard of\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe cutaneous lesions now again undergo a change. Some of the pustules\r\nrupture, and their viscid contents, oozing forth, concrete into a\r\nyellowish crust which gradually assumes a brownish hue. Others\r\ndesiccate en masse, the roof-wall first collapsing upon the contents,\r\nthus producing an appearance which again suggests umbilication of the\r\nlesions. This is sometimes termed a secondary umbilication. The\r\ndesiccation en masse is doubtless due to the evaporation of a portion\r\nof the fluid exuded into the superficial strata of the integument, and\r\nthe consequent inspissation of the pus. Often the face at this moment\r\nis totally concealed by a dense, dry, brownish or even blackish mask,\r\ncomposed of the crusts furnished by numerous individual lesions. At\r\nthe same time the tumefaction of the skin subsides, and the subjective\r\nsensations to which it gave rise gradually disappear. Beneath the\r\ncrusts cicatrization advances till the former are lessened, and\r\nfinally, becoming detached, fall in quantity from the surfaces\r\nsubjected to friction. Beneath them are seen brownish and violaceous\r\nblotches, the integument thus stained slowly losing its abnormal\r\ncolor. It is thus seen to be the seat of multiple, slightly depressed,\r\nshining scars of a dead white color, which in the course of time lose\r\nsomewhat of their disfiguring prominence, but which when typically\r\ndistinct persist for a lifetime. This exfoliation of crusts continues\r\ntill the skin is completely rid of its pathological products, the\r\nprocess being completed with entire restoration to health about the\r\nconclusion of the fourth or fifth week of the disease. Meantime, in\r\nfavorable cases, convalescence progresses pari passu. The patient has\r\na returning appetite, decadence of symptoms originating in impairment\r\nof function of the mucous membranes, and gains in weight till the\r\nrestoration to sound health is complete.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history in outline of what may be regarded as a typical\r\nform of uncomplicated variola. It should not be forgotten, however,\r\nthat in different epidemics there are marked differences in the career\r\nand manifestations of the malady, and that even among the cases\r\nobserved in a single locality visited by the disease the same\r\ndivergence of symptoms is no less conspicuous. This diversity is due\r\nto several causes, irrespective of the remarkable modifications\r\ndisplayed in the variolous who have been previously vaccinated.\r\nIndividual susceptibility is doubtless to be considered in this\r\nconnection, as also the temperament, bodily vigor, and hygienic\r\nsurroundings of those who are infected. It is possible also that the\r\nintensity of the poison may be subjected to occasional modifications\r\nin its transmission from individual to individual. In this way the\r\nfollowing types of variola present themselves in clinical forms with\r\ndivergent features:\r\n\r\nCONFLUENT VARIOLA (variola confluens).--This virulent form of {441}\r\nsmall-pox is ushered in by a relatively short incubative period,\r\nfollowed by a severe invasion of the disease. The premonitory chill is\r\nviolent; the cephalic and lumbar pains are excruciating; the fever,\r\nrising to a high grade, 106° to 110° F., with few and slight\r\nremissions, scarcely subsides, if at all, with the appearance of the\r\neruption, the latter developing early, and, to borrow an expression\r\nfrom syphilographers, exploding with violence over large areas of the\r\nsurface of the body. The initial lesions of the exanthem are dense and\r\ndeeply-set papules, so closely coherent even at this moment that they\r\nscarcely leave between them interspaces of sound skin. During the\r\nvesiculo-pustular transformation which they promptly undergo on the\r\nsecond day there is a more or less complete coalescence of the\r\nelements of the eruption, which circumstance has given this form of\r\nthe disease its name, confluent variola. This confluence is most\r\nconspicuous upon the face and hands, where large flat vesicles run\r\ntogether, form pus-filled bullæ, and finally convert the surface on\r\nwhich they rest into a single, large, many-chambered pustule. All this\r\noccurs upon an enormously swollen and inflamed skin, disfiguring every\r\nfeature of the face and wellnigh obliterating every external\r\ndistinction between the scalp, nose, eyes, and mouth. Here and there\r\nthe mass is elevated by the quantity of exuded pus to a more notable\r\nprojection from the surface. Pustules filled with blood may appear at\r\nseveral points. At others, the suppurative inflammation may be seen to\r\nhave eroded the derma, which is covered with a diphtheritic membranous\r\nexudation similar to that covering the mucous membranes lining the\r\nmouth, nose, and ears. Naturally, the skin in its totality often\r\nyields to these destructive processes and in large patches falls into\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nThe confluence of the lesions is less marked in other parts of the\r\nbody than the face and hands, yet the entire surface may be covered\r\nwith a coherent exanthem which becomes elsewhere, in large areas,\r\nconfluent. The writer has seen patients in whom the head of a pin\r\ncould not be placed upon an unaffected patch of skin in any portion of\r\nthe body. The parts subjected to pressure in the reclining posture,\r\nsuch as the back, shoulders, and buttocks, are especially liable to\r\nthis coalescence of the pustular lesions.\r\n\r\nIn confluent variola too, as already intimated, the mucous surfaces\r\nsuffer proportionately. Pasty accumulations of muco-pus and\r\ndiphtheritic exudation, like macerated chamois leather, cover the\r\ntongue, which is often so enormously swollen as to bulge between the\r\nteeth and project from the mouth. These exudations line the mouth,\r\npharynx, larynx, and even the bronchi. Beneath these masses the eroded\r\nmucous surface is dry, livid red in color, and has a varnished aspect.\r\nGangrene here may lead to necrosis of the cartilages of the larynx.\r\nAphonia is often complete, deglutition impossible, respiration\r\ndifficult. The stench arising from the patient is intolerably fetid\r\nand pervading, and a single exhalation will poison the best-ventilated\r\napartment. The submaxillary and sublingual glands are enlarged and the\r\nneighboring lymphatics swollen.\r\n\r\nThe patient who is plunged into this grave condition is the victim of\r\na fever which is unquestionably septicæmic in character; he has a\r\nsmall, frequent, and often fluttering pulse; his mental condition is\r\nbetrayed by a delirium of varying grade or he lies comatose. In this\r\nstate a fatal {442} result is often induced by either exhaustion of\r\nthe vital forces or an intercurrent malady, such as pleurisy,\r\npneumonia, cardiac inflammation, oedema of the glottis, or an\r\nuncontrollable diarrhoea. In yet other cases the patient falls into a\r\ntyphoid state, and, after surviving for a fortnight or more with a low\r\nfever, a broncho-pneumonia, or a diarrhoea, succumbs to an inevitable\r\nexhaustion, the surface of his body being yet covered with a dry,\r\nblackish, and fetid crust.\r\n\r\nThe expression of an intense variolous poison is known as hemorrhagic\r\nvariola; also as purpura variolosa and black pox. A large number of\r\nsuch cases have been designated and treated as black measles, the real\r\nnature of the malady having been mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe law readily observed by the diagnostician of diseases in general\r\nmust here be recognized. There are no hard and fast lines in nature.\r\nHemorrhagic variola occurs, without question, in different types. At\r\nthe one extreme are classed the inevitably fatal cases, where the\r\npatient sinks smitten by the malady even before the exanthem is\r\ndeveloped; at the other are found the cases of confluent variola, not\r\nnecessarily fatal, in the course of which hemorrhagic lesions appear\r\nin variable number, blood either filling the pustules after the latter\r\nhave arrived at maturity, or forming ab initio purpuric pocks\r\nintermingled with the typical lesions of the variolous exanthem.\r\nHowever ill-defined the limits between these classes may be, the\r\nsymptoms of hemorrhagic variola are sufficiently characteristic to\r\nrequire separate description. According to Kaposi, it occurs in the\r\ntwo following types:\r\n\r\nThe first form is termed variolic purpura. Its incubative period is\r\nbrief and distinguished by unusual conditions of malaise and lumbar\r\npain. On the fourth day there is an intense fever with rapid pulse,\r\nand this is speedily followed by a deep purplish-red staining of the\r\nface, neck, trunk, and extremities, the skin thus affected being\r\nslightly tumid and quite dry. Minute maculo-papules can be\r\ndistinguished here and there over the surface, often closely set\r\ntogether, and presenting the characteristic color described above. At\r\nthis stage of the disease the eruption greatly suggests an intense\r\nrubeolous exanthem, and has been, as a result, repeatedly mistaken for\r\nthe so-called black measles. But the excruciating pains persist, there\r\nis often coincident delirium, and the pin-head sized maculo-papules\r\nnoted above become lenticular in shape, cease to lose their color\r\nunder the pressure of the finger, extend peripherally even in a few\r\nhours, flatten and become purpuric patches of a bluish-black shade,\r\npalm-sized and even larger, covering extensive areas of the\r\nintegument, new lesions forming in unaffected islets of the skin;\r\nconjunctival ecchymoses appear at the angles formed by the lids, and\r\nfinally encircle the cornea with an annular purplish-black cushion.\r\nThe mucous surfaces become dry, crack, and bleed where the epithelium\r\nis torn, and become covered with offensive crusts. The odor exhaled by\r\nthe patient is intolerably fetid. He lies stupid as the march to a\r\nfatal issue is hourly hastened. Hemorrhages occur from the larynx,\r\nbronchial membrane, intestinal surfaces, and even into the parenchyma\r\nof the viscera, the muscles, serous membranes, periosteum, and\r\nneurilemma. The urine is retained in the bladder; the respirations\r\nrapidly increase in frequency; the pulse flutters; and death closes\r\nthe scene between one and two days after the onset of the malady. In\r\nseveral cases observed by the writer, {443} occurring in infants and\r\nchildren, the entire course of the malady was completed in twelve\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nIn the second and much rarer form of hemorrhagic variola there are the\r\nusual unfavorable portents of intense prodromic symptoms. On the\r\nfourth day the skin is swollen and indurated in consequence of the\r\ndevelopment within its structure of numerous firm, roundish, slightly\r\nacuminate papules, so thickly set together that it is wellnigh\r\nimpossible to distinguish between them. These are early in betraying\r\nthe bluish-black hue significant of hemorrhage into their mass. They\r\nmultiply in number and increase in size, while their hemorrhagic\r\nstains widen and sweep from each as a centre, like the waves that\r\nspread from a pebble thrown into smooth water. In these cases, more\r\noften than in those first described, pus-filled pocks may develop over\r\nsome portions of the surface, while in others a species of gangrene\r\noccurs in consequence of the separation of the derma from the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues by effused blood. At times pustules of somewhat\r\ntypical aspect are formed and subsequently filled with blood by a\r\nhemorrhage from below. The accompanying symptoms are grave, but less\r\nrapidly fatal than in the other types of the disease. Delirium,\r\nstupor, an intense fever, and a rapid, feeble pulse are commonly\r\nnoted. A fatal result is usually reached in from four to five days.\r\n\r\nHemorrhagic lesions, isolated or confluent, are seen also in severe\r\nforms of variola, not of the two types described above. Thus, in\r\nconfluent small-pox, especially when occurring among the unvaccinated,\r\nsome of the pustules on the face, the back, or possibly the legs,\r\nwhere varicosities of the veins permit a passive engorgement of the\r\ntissues with blood, may become the seat of a hemorrhage. For these\r\nlocal causes are often etiologically effective. In other cases the\r\nappearance of the hemorrhagic lesions seems to be due to a dyscrasia,\r\nsuch as that recognized in phthisis, chronic alcoholism, and\r\nhæmophilia.\r\n\r\nAside from the trivial accidents to which the exanthem may be subject,\r\nthe hemorrhagic types of variola may be regarded as necessarily grave\r\nand in a large proportion of cases inevitably fatal. That they are all\r\ntruly the results of variolous poisoning is shown, first, by the\r\noccurrence of intermediate forms; second, by the occasional\r\ntransmission of the disease in its typical aspects to the partially\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nVARIOLOID is that form of variola in which the disease is modified,\r\neither in its course, duration, or intensity of symptoms, such\r\nmodification usually resulting, directly or indirectly, from the\r\nprotective influence of vaccination or from a previous attack of\r\nvariola.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the class of patients commonly regarded as suffering\r\nfrom varioloid are all those of variola, modified, however, in the\r\ndirection of a mitigation of their intensity and dangerous character.\r\nIt is thus evident that there is no strict line of demarcation between\r\nthe very mildest physical expression of the variolous poison and that\r\nvariola vera which presents atypically benign symptoms in any stage of\r\nits career. Within this wide range of possibilities cases of varioloid\r\noccur which certainly differ from each other by very marked degrees.\r\n\r\nThe invasion stage of varioloid may be shorter or longer than that\r\noccurring in variola vera, and may be insignificant or intensely\r\nmarked as regards the severity of its symptoms. According to\r\nBartholow[4] the {444} invasion rashes are here of common occurrence;\r\nand the more extensive the latter, the less copious the subsequent\r\neruption. It must be admitted that a personal experience has not\r\nconfirmed us in this view.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nAfter the high fever and severe cephalic and lumbar pains of this\r\nstage there may follow, in the case of varioloid, a complete\r\ndefervescence and the appearance of a very copious exanthem. With\r\nthis, however, the apogee of the disease may be reached, and the\r\nsubsequent symptoms be altogether insufficient in comparison with\r\nthose which have preceded. Thus, the maculo-papules may never reach a\r\nvesicular stage, or, having attained this, the vesicles may not be\r\numbilicated, or may shrivel after their contents have assumed a\r\nlactescent color, and be succeeded by light superficial crusts which\r\nin a few days fall. Or, again, the pustular stage of the lesions may\r\nbe fully developed, even with the production of a halo about the\r\npocks, while yet there is no swelling of the skin and but trifling\r\nsubjective sensations experienced by the patient. The pustules in the\r\ncourse of from four days to a week desiccate and are shed, leaving\r\nbehind them violaceous pigmentations of the surface without persistent\r\ncicatricial sequelæ.\r\n\r\nOther cases, again, instead of producing the impression upon an\r\nobserver of being illustrations of a malady aborted or cut short at\r\nsome period of its career, seem to exhibit merely a modification in\r\nthe intensity or distribution of symptoms betrayed in a wellnigh\r\ntypical career. Thus, there may be a total absence or insignificant\r\nreminder of the septic fever usually known as the secondary fever of\r\nvariola, and the elements of the eruption may be few or appear in\r\nscanty number upon the face and more copiously elsewhere. The latter\r\nmay, however, pursue a perfectly typical career and be followed by\r\ncharacteristic scars.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another type of varioloid with which many practitioners\r\nbecome familiar who have experience in epidemics of small-pox. The\r\npatient exhibits distinct symptoms of malaise in the period of\r\nincubation. The fever of invasion, with its characteristic pains and\r\nnausea, is equally well marked. Defervescence occurs with a trifling\r\neruption of maculo-papules, which in two days have wellnigh completely\r\ndisappeared. There is no secondary fever, but the patient is far from\r\nwell. There is a period of anæmia, mental depression, marked languor,\r\nand unmistakable evidences of physical prostration out of all\r\nproportion to the precedent symptoms. In these cases it may well be\r\nbelieved that the poison has at last produced a strong impression upon\r\nthe nervous centres. The most characteristic feature of these cases is\r\nthe tedious convalescence from an apparently trifling form of the\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nThe identity of varioloid with variola is abundantly shown--first, by\r\nthe occurrence of intermediate forms of every grade, from the mildest\r\nevidence of variolous poisoning to typically developed cases of\r\nvariola vera; second, by the fact that patients affected with\r\nvarioloid are capable of transmitting variola to the unprotected;\r\nthird, by the anatomico-pathological fact that the structure of the\r\npock, when it appears, is the same in all.\r\n\r\nA variation as to the form and contents of the lesion of modified\r\nvariola occasionally occurs as a consequence of individual\r\npeculiarities or of the special surroundings of the patient. A number\r\nof useless terms have been employed to designate these peculiarities,\r\nthe most of which {445} are relics of the superstitions of the past.\r\nIn variola siliquosa the pocks are said to contain air only; in v.\r\npemphicosa, bullous lesions predominate; in v. verrucosa, the papules,\r\nafter partial evolution and involution, leave minute wart-like\r\npapillary masses upon the face; in v. crystallina, there are\r\nsuperficial vesicles only filled with clear serum, which somewhat\r\nresemble those recognized as sudamina. The older English writers with\r\nas little reason described cases of horn-pox, swine-pox, etc.,\r\ndiffering only from those of variola by the anomalous behavior of the\r\nexanthem in the course of its evolution.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Besides the terms given above, Hebra gives the following\r\nlist of Latin adjectives which have been employed to describe special\r\nvarieties of small-pox, none of which requires special explanation:\r\nvariola papulosa, conica, acuminata, globosa, globulosa, tuberculosa,\r\ncornea, fimbriata, miliaris, lymphatica, vesiculosa, pustularis,\r\nrosea, morbillosa, carbunculosa, etc.]\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--The complications and sequelæ of variola\r\nare fewer in number and more restricted in range than those of many\r\nother maladies. This results from the remarkable unity of the disease\r\nas it occurs in its several manifestations among the unprotected, its\r\nrelatively rapid progress, and its absolute disappearance on the\r\ncompletion of its curriculum. There is no chronic form of variola\r\nlingering for weeks and months after the violence of the fever has\r\nabated.\r\n\r\nFuruncles and abscesses occasionally result during or after the\r\npustular stage of the disease has been reached, sometimes of such\r\nextent as to give exit to large quantities of an ill-conditioned pus.\r\nThe tissues, weakened by the suppurative process which the skin has\r\nundergone, may then necrose, and thus lay bare periosteum, cartilage,\r\nor bone. Erysipelas, especially about the face, may close the eyes,\r\nencroach upon the scalp, or spread extensively over other regions.\r\nMuscular paralyses, hemiplegic and paraplegic attacks, albuminuria,\r\ndiarrhoea, and the inflammations of chronic type affecting the\r\nthoracic organs may each supervene, and either greatly prolong\r\nconvalescence or precipitate a fatal issue. None of them is perhaps\r\nmore common than a low typhoid and febrile state, in which the patient\r\nlies after his variola is practically ended, his skin struggling to\r\nregain its normal tone, a fever of remittent type taxing his energies,\r\nhis bowels in frequent movements discharging a thin and fetid feculent\r\nmatter, while a low delirium renders him insensible to the gravity of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nReference has been made above to the implication of the eyes of the\r\nvariolous, and the possibility of the disorder terminating, after an\r\notherwise favorable convalescence, in total blindness, should not be\r\nforgotten. The cornea may be the seat of pustules or a diffuse\r\npuriform infiltration resulting in ulceration, and eventually\r\nperforation with hernia of the iris. At times it is merely macerated\r\nby the pus continually covering it, and in that condition yields to\r\neven moderate pressure. At others the deeper portions of the globe\r\nfall into inflammation, and there is a resulting cyclitis,\r\nirido-cyclitis, or parophthalmia.\r\n\r\nIn the nose severe destructive effects may follow the pustular\r\ninvolvement of the Schneiderian membrane, including necrosis of the\r\nnasal bones and profuse epistaxis.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, the external ear may be involved, the tympanum\r\ndisappear, a severe otitis media supervene, and the mastoid cells\r\nbecome filled with pus and detritus of necrosed tissue.\r\n\r\n{446} In the larynx, which may be well lined with pustules, as\r\nindicated above, complications may arise in the shape of oedema of the\r\nary-epiglottic folds,[6] laryngo-oesophageal abscess and various\r\ndiphtheritic deposits lining every portion of the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: J. William White, \"Surgical Aspects of Small-Pox,\"\r\n_Medical News_, March 4, 1882, p. 241.]\r\n\r\nOther disorders noted as complicating variola are hydrocele and\r\norchitis in the male, ovaritis in the female, gangrene of scrotum or\r\nlabia, hæmaturia, peritonitis, adenopathy and lymphangitis and\r\narthritis, as well as peri-arthritic suppurative inflammation.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Ours is a day in which bacteria,\r\nspecial to each of a number of infectious diseases (lepra, pemphigus,\r\ntuberculosis, etc.), are constantly reported as coming to light under\r\nthe persuasive influence of modern staining solutions. With respect to\r\nvariola, it may be said that while Cohn, Klebs, Weigert, and others\r\nhave, without question, recognized microsphæra, micrococci, and\r\nsimilar organisms in variolous pus, their causative relation to the\r\npathological process has certainly not yet been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe pathological anatomy of the cutaneous lesions of variola has been\r\nvery carefully studied by Auspitz and Basch,[7] and Heitzmann.[8] The\r\nfollowing is a condensed account of the results reached by these\r\nobservers:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Virch. Archiv_, Bd. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Trans. of Amer. Derm. Ass._, Aug., 1879.]\r\n\r\nFirst appear circumscribed patches of hyperæmia, in which the\r\npapillary layer of the corium is concerned, and which is followed by\r\nsome thickening of the rete, the epithelia involved becoming coarsely\r\ngranular. This granular condition is due to an increase of living\r\nmatter within the protoplasmic bodies, evident at the points of\r\nintersection of the reticulum of which they are composed, the nuclei\r\nbecoming solid and shining, and the threads traversing this\r\ncement-substance between them becoming also increased in thickness.\r\nThe papillæ beneath increase in size in consequence of their vascular\r\nengorgement, and in consequence of the change experienced by the\r\nconnective-tissue bundles, which are partly transformed into\r\nprotoplasm, while the protoplasm between them increases also. There\r\nis, in brief, a liquefaction of the glue-giving basis-substance, which\r\nmakes visible the reticulum of living matter formerly hidden within\r\nit. In this way the epidermis is raised into the flat solid papules\r\nwhich are the early lesions of the disease.\r\n\r\nThen follows an exudation of a serous fluid at one or more points in\r\nthe papule, the meshes of the reticulum being so stretched and torn\r\nthat small chambers are formed filled with the liquid exudate\r\ncontaining granules. Between these chambers the separating strata of\r\nepithelia are compressed so as to form septa or partition walls. The\r\nneighboring epithelia become granular, divested of their cement\r\nenvelope, and transformed into protoplasmic clusters still connected\r\nwith the living reticulum by slender threads. An irregular cavity is\r\nthus formed in the thickened rete traversed by septa, the contained\r\nexudation being filled with granules, coagulated fibrin, and lymph. A\r\nfew protoplasmic bodies are here also distinguishable, which Heitzmann\r\nregards as either débris of destroyed epithelia or colorless\r\nblood-corpuscles.\r\n\r\nIn these changes the connective-tissue beneath participates. The\r\npapillæ eventually disappear, the superior portion of the corium being\r\nreplaced by {447} clusters of medullary or inflammatory elements\r\nuninterruptedly connected by threads of living matter.\r\n\r\nThe pus-corpuscles which eventually appear originate mainly from\r\ntransformed epithelia. In the process of transformation the increased\r\nprotoplasm of the epithelia first exhibits shining homogeneous lumps,\r\nwhich, after an intermediate stage of vacuolation, undergo an\r\nendogenous metamorphosis into nucleated bodies with a reticulum in\r\neach. To the number of these there is possibly an addition by the\r\nimmigration from below (diapedesis) of leucocytes.\r\n\r\nThe question of repair with or without the production of cicatrices\r\nrests upon the behavior of the connective-tissue elements. If these\r\nare not torn asunder, but remain in connection with each other, the\r\nre-formation of a glue-giving basis-substance is possible, and new\r\nbundles of fibrous connective-tissue take the place of the old. If, on\r\nthe contrary, the latter are completely destroyed, their place is\r\nfilled with the cicatricial new growth. The pigmentation, which is\r\nsuch a common transitory sequela of the skin lesions, is due both to\r\nthe imbibition of the coloring matter of the blood by the epithelia\r\nand by direct hemorrhagic exudation into both the rete and derma.\r\n\r\nThe umbilication of the mature pock is doubtless due to the situation\r\nof such lesions at the orifices of the excretory ducts of the\r\nskin-glands. The epidermis, in one or more of its strata, dips\r\ndownward to form a living investment for such glands, and in this\r\nsituation ties down the centre of the roof-wall of the pustules.\r\nEventually, it too, as a result of the maceration and tension\r\nincidental to the complete filling of the pock with pus-elements, is\r\nruptured or stretched, and the umbilication of the pustule disappears.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the exanthematous lesions in hemorrhagic variola is not\r\ndifferent from that described above. The pocks in such cases are\r\nmerely filled with blood instead of with pus or sero-pus. In some\r\nforms of hemorrhagic variola, as indeed would be suggested by their\r\nclinical observation, there is hemorrhage directly into the tissues of\r\nthe integument, or, more probably in severe cases, a mere passive\r\nleaking of the sanguineous fluid with its coloring matter through the\r\nrelaxed and weakened vascular walls.\r\n\r\nThe morbid changes occurring in the viscera are described by\r\nCurschmann as follows: The mucous surfaces may be the seat of\r\npustules, diffuse purulent infiltration, and catarrhal, croupous, or\r\ndiphtheritic inflammation. As regards the extent of diffusion of the\r\npustular lesions, they occur, according to Wagner, in bronchi of the\r\nsecond and even of the third order, rarely in the stomach and\r\nintestines, and in the rectum only in its lowest portion. The bladder,\r\nurethra, and serous surfaces are always exempt. The lungs, breast,\r\nliver, spleen, brain, and spinal medulla are variously involved. Often\r\nthe tissues of these organs are quite unchanged as regards their\r\nmacroscopical appearance. At other times the tissues appear swollen,\r\ngranular, and undergo a fatty degeneration. In purpura variolosa the\r\nspleen and walls of the heart, however, are seen to be firm, dark-red,\r\nand more or less indurated.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The establishment of a correct diagnosis where there is\r\nquestion of variola is one of the most critical and important of the\r\nduties of a physician. Upon such decisions have turned, again and\r\nagain, {448} professional success or disaster. To pronounce that case\r\nto be variolous which is not of such a nature is to subject one to the\r\nindignation of the few and the ridicule of the many. On the other\r\nhand, to be guilty of treating a patient with small-pox, and of\r\nremaining ignorant of the nature of the malady, is to subject many\r\nignorant people to the danger of exposure to the disease and to render\r\none's self liable for the redress sought by recourse to the civil\r\nauthorities and the law. It is difficult to decide which predicament\r\nis the graver.\r\n\r\nTypical variola vera is readily recognized by its characteristic\r\nfeatures. As usual, it is the atypical and modified forms where the\r\ndifficulty most often arises and where the danger to the physician is\r\nproportionately increased.\r\n\r\nIn the invasion stage of the disease it is often impossible to\r\nrecognize any symptoms characteristic of variola. High fever with\r\nsevere lumbar pain, considerable gastric distress, and the appearance\r\nof one of the invasion rashes (roseola variolosa) would, however, put\r\nthe observant practitioner on his guard. I have often noticed in these\r\ncases a symptom which, apparently insignificant, has on more than one\r\noccasion preceded the eruptive period. It is the occurrence upon the\r\ncentre of the two cheeks of a vivid damask-red blush, occasionally\r\nhaving a purplish-red hue, and with a very remarkable circumscribed\r\narea. This may be recognized in children and adults of both sexes when\r\nit occurs in typical aspect, and is undoubtedly a hyperæmia of the\r\ncharacter of that producing the rashes in Simon's triangles.\r\n\r\nWhen the variolous exanthem first appears the practitioner should\r\nsecure as soon as practicable a history of the invasion stage if this\r\nhas not been subject to his personal observation. He should then make\r\ncareful inquiry as to the possibility of a neighboring source of\r\ncontagion, and ascertain by inspection whether the person of the\r\npatient exhibits the evidences of successful vaccination. In this\r\nconnection it is always well to estimate the value of the elements\r\nrepresented by (_a_) the period ascertained as having elapsed since\r\nthe last successful vaccination; (_b_) the typical or atypical\r\ncharacter of the existing cicatrices of vaccinia; (_c_) the unicity or\r\nmultiplicity of the cicatrices simultaneously resulting from\r\nvaccinations performed at one and the same date.\r\n\r\nWithout question, the first papular lesions of variola resemble those\r\nof rubeola or measles to an extent which has often deceived the most\r\nexpert diagnosticians. The distinguishing points are--(1) In measles,\r\ncatarrhal symptoms (conjunctival, nasal, laryngeal, bronchial), which\r\nare usually absent in the early stages of variola, and later are\r\nobviously associated with the irritation set up of the pustules of the\r\nmaturing period. (2) The difference in the temperature record, that\r\nnoted in the invasion stage of variola varying from 104° to 105° F.,\r\nwhile in rubeola it is rarely registered above 103° F. Moreover, in\r\ntypical variola the defervescence is marked and characteristic on the\r\nappearance of the exanthem, while in rubeola, when the rash appears,\r\nthe temperature is usually sustained at a maximum, and may even rise.\r\n(3) The differences in the rashes of the two disorders. The papules of\r\nvariola, even in its confluent forms, are, when first observed,\r\nremarkably discrete and exhibit not the slightest tendency to\r\ngrouping, while the maculo-papules of rubeola are (_a_) developed\r\nsimultaneously on the face and trunk, while those of variola {449}\r\ncommonly appear first on the face and afterward on the trunk, the\r\nolder, and larger therefore, in the site of earliest appearance; (_b_)\r\nare set in clusters or groups having a distinct tendency to crescentic\r\narrangement, a symptom decidedly best appreciated by the eye when the\r\neruption is viewed in totality or in large areas with the eye of the\r\nobserver somewhat removed from the surface; (_c_) are often made to\r\ndisappear or pale beneath the pressure of the finger, while there is\r\ngreater persistence of color in the variolous papules; (_d_) are\r\nsurrounded by little or no halo, each elementary lesion of the\r\neruption being abruptly defined upon the sound skin, while the\r\nvariolous papule is apt to rest upon a circlet of hyperæmic\r\nintegument.\r\n\r\nEven with careful observation of all the specific differences between\r\nthe two diseases, they may, for a brief time, so resemble each other\r\nas to defy the skill of the expert. In all doubtful cases the\r\nphysician should invariably admit the doubt and defer an exact\r\ndiagnosis for twenty-four hours. During the delay the variolous\r\nexanthem should betray its individuality by the formation of a minute\r\nvesicular apex at the summit of several papules.\r\n\r\nIn scarlatina the uniform diffusion of the exanthematous blush, the\r\nabsence of papules and vesico-papules, the continuance of the fever\r\nafter the rash has appeared, the characteristic scarlet or\r\nboiled-lobster color of the skin, and the anginose condition of the\r\nthroat, are all significant symptoms. In hemorrhagic small-pox the\r\ncolor of the integument is a much more purplish and lurid-reddish hue,\r\nrapidly reaching that stage where it refuses to pale under the\r\npressure of the finger, and never leaving in the track of the\r\nfinger-nail quickly drawn over its surface the peculiar transitory\r\nyellowish-white line which can be usually obtained in the skin of the\r\npatient with scarlatina.\r\n\r\nThe pustular stage of variola might be confounded with the pustular\r\nsyphiloderm. But in the latter there should be a history of a chronic\r\nrather than of an acute affection, and, as a result, the simultaneous\r\nappearance of lesions in very different stages of their career, some\r\ndistended with pus, others ruptured and crusted, yet others which have\r\nrecently formed in the immediate vicinity of the oldest lesions, while\r\nthe latter have been in full involution or have been replaced by\r\nsuperficial losses of tissue.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of pustular variola to certain suppurative and other\r\ndisorders of the sebaceous glands is well attested by the name given\r\nby certain French authors to molluscum epitheliale (M. contagiosum, M.\r\nsebaceum)--viz. acne varioliformis. But in the case of acneiform\r\ndisorders the concurrence of comedones, the chronic course of the\r\ndisease, the absence of fever and systemic disturbance, and the\r\nparticularly irregular distribution of the lesions upon the face, with\r\nfailure to appear elsewhere,--all these facts forbid the confusion of\r\nthe affection with variola. In medicamentous acne, accompanied by the\r\nsudden appearance of numerous pustular lesions symmetrically displayed\r\nupon the surface, there will indeed be a source of error. In such\r\ncases, of course, a history of the ingestion of a medicament capable\r\nof producing a rash will afford valuable aid in the diagnosis. In\r\npustular forms of dermatitis medicamentosa there will usually be found\r\na more abundant development of the pus-containing lesions upon the\r\nhead and both arms and forearms, with {450} no tendency to extension\r\nover very large areas of the trunk and lower extremities--a\r\ncircumstance which a delay of but a few hours will often substantiate.\r\n\r\nThe absence of marked defervescence is the most characteristic\r\ndifference between variola in its eruptive stage and typhus, typhoid,\r\nand relapsing fevers. Pneumonia, cerebro-spinal meningitis, acute\r\nmiliary tuberculosis, and gastric fever are all to be differentiated\r\nfrom variola by the occurrence of symptoms characteristic of the\r\ninvolvement of the several organs which in these diseases respectively\r\nare more particularly impaired.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of variola is wellnigh inseparably\r\nassociated with the question of protection by vaccination. Variola\r\nvera in the unprotected is an exceedingly fatal malady, the death-rate\r\nvarying in different epidemics according to the severity of each and\r\nthe ages and hygienic surroundings of the victims of the disease.\r\nCertainly, from 15 to 50 per cent. of unprotected individuals affected\r\nwith the disease occurring in epidemic form in any given community\r\nwill perish. This number may, however, be enormously increased, as,\r\nfor example, among a large number of unprotected negroes crowded\r\ntogether in a filthy prison, or when the malady makes a periodical\r\nvisitation to an insular community where long isolation has begotten a\r\ncarelessness with respect to vaccination.\r\n\r\nWith respect to individual cases it may be asserted, first, that an\r\nintense series of prodromic symptoms, followed by the appearance of an\r\nunusually large number of cutaneous lesions, is often unfavorable.\r\nConfluence of the latter adds to the gravity; hemorrhagic and purpuric\r\nsymptoms are in the highest degree portentous, and commonly indicate a\r\nfatal result. Women pregnant or in the puerperal state, infants at the\r\nbreast, and persons of both sexes at advanced ages, are little able to\r\nresist the ravages of the disease. According to Kaposi, women recently\r\ndelivered prematurely or who have lately suffered from an abortion\r\nsuccumb more often than others of their sex. Chronic alcoholism among\r\nmale subjects and the cachexia induced by all chronic visceral and\r\nsystemic disorders are sources of weakness which largely increase the\r\ndeath-list by adding to the heavy strain upon the vital energies. The\r\nprognosis is rendered uncertain or unpromising by extensive\r\ninvolvement of the mucous as well as of the cutaneous surfaces, by\r\nmarked visceral complications, by evidences of shock or exhaustion\r\nbefore the apogee of the exanthem is reached, by grave sequelæ, and\r\neven by simple complications of the malady when, instead of entering\r\npromptly upon convalescence, the patient lingers for weeks in a\r\ntyphoid condition. An unfavorable symptom in any case is the sudden\r\ncessation of the processes actively pursued upon the surface of the\r\nbody. The swelling of the integument then suddenly diminishes and the\r\ncrusts by which it was covered shrivel. The eruption, in brief, seems\r\nto undergo what may be described as a collapse. The pulse at such\r\nmoments usually flutters feebly, and there are other portents of\r\ndissolution which the eye of the physician will hardly fail to\r\ninterpret correctly. The fluids in such instances mechanically drain\r\naway from the surface of the body to seek the deeper parts. This is\r\nnot peculiar to small-pox. Similar phenomena occur even in the case of\r\nother than exudative affections of the skin. In pityriasis rubra the\r\n{451} patient dies leaving an integument apparently unaffected, and I\r\nhave seen a patient dead of even multiple sarcoma of the skin when the\r\ntumors were reduced fully one-half in bulk as the result of a similar\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the practitioner should never forget that even\r\napparently desperate cases of variola rally and are won back to life.\r\nThat the exudative process should be in full evolution at the surface\r\nof the body is, cæteris paribus, certainly so far a good omen. The\r\nmost hideous, extensive, and stench-emitting crusts have hidden for a\r\ntime the forms that have for many subsequent years not only known the\r\nenjoyment of life, but have made that life of inestimable value to\r\nothers. The physician in the presence of this most loathsome and\r\nformidable disease should never despair.\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT.--The loftiest end to be reached by the\r\nphysician of our day with respect to variola is its complete removal\r\nfrom all civilized countries, and indeed from the face of the earth,\r\nby the practice of universal vaccination and revaccination. The\r\nevident modifications which the disease has undergone in late years as\r\na consequence of the extraordinary attention given to this subject is\r\nan earnest of the future. The day is probably not far distant when the\r\nman, woman, and child unprotected by vaccination will properly be\r\nregarded as an enemy of the human race, and treated accordingly.\r\nEvidences of the most satisfactory character as to successful\r\nvaccination should be imperatively required of all applicants for\r\nadmission to schools, academies, colleges, charitable institutions,\r\npublic libraries, art-galleries, and places of labor controlled by\r\nincorporated institutions; of all members of conventions,\r\nlegislatures, political, religious, and deliberative bodies; of every\r\npurchaser of a ticket for purposes of travel; and of every voter. In\r\naddition, there should be in every district a systematic and\r\nperiodical inspection of all persons registered in the census by\r\npersons qualified and competent to perform compulsory vaccination.\r\nThis is the scientific treatment of variola.\r\n\r\nRespecting the therapeutic management of variola, it must be admitted\r\nthat there are no remedies known to exert the slightest influence in\r\neither cutting short the curriculum of the disorder or in checking its\r\nprogress in any stage. When vaccination is practised after the disease\r\nis fully developed, the two disorders, vaccinia and variola,\r\napparently concur, and proceed pari passu to the evolution peculiar to\r\neach. Quinia, the sarracenia purpurea, the salicylate of sodium,\r\nemetics, diaphoretics, purgatives, and other remedies and methods\r\nvaunted as efficacious, have again and again failed to establish the\r\nclaims which have been put forth respecting the value of each.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the considerations to be regarded at the outset\r\nof the management of the small-pox patient relate to his hygienic\r\nsurroundings and nursing--considerations which scarcely differ from\r\nthose recognized as of general importance in the case of all septic,\r\ncontagious, and filth-producing diseases.\r\n\r\nThe timid, the fearful, and the unprotected are to be at once\r\ndismissed from the bedside, and trustworthy attendants secured who\r\nhave received protection by either recent vaccination or a prior\r\nattack of the malady. The sick chamber should be sufficiently large\r\nand capable of the most thorough ventilation by free access of air.\r\nSolar light should be excluded {452} as rigidly and completely as\r\npossible, since it is reasonably certain that its access to the face\r\nhas an etiological relation to the pitting of that part, often the\r\nmost serious sequel of the affection. It is an interesting fact that\r\npitting is much less frequently noted on those parts of the body from\r\nwhich light is excluded by the covering of the clothing. The\r\ntemperature of the sick room during the febrile stages of the disorder\r\nshould not rise above 70° F. nor be permitted to fall below 60° F.\r\nBetween these extremes a variation may be made in accordance with the\r\nsensations of the patient.\r\n\r\nDuring the invasion stage of the disease the patient can rarely\r\nassimilate food, but if this be possible it should be given throughout\r\nthe entire course of the disease in the form of animal broths, eggs,\r\nnutritious soups, and milk. Iced and acidulated beverages are often\r\ngrateful to the palate, and small lumps of ice should be permitted to\r\ndissolve slowly in the mouth. Lime-water may be required by unusual\r\ngastric irritability. As the disease progresses and the palate and\r\nbuccal membrane become painful and sore by reason of the localization\r\nthere of pustular and other lesions, various mouth-washes and gargles\r\nmay be ordered, such as those containing the chlorate of potassium,\r\nthe tincture of myrrh, the tincture of cinchona, or even the milder\r\ndemulcent fluids made by the addition of flaxseed, gum acacia, or\r\npowdered elm-bark to water. In almost all such cases the skilled nurse\r\nwill accomplish a grateful result by frequently cleansing the mouth of\r\nthe sufferer (especially before the deglutition of aliments) by\r\ncovering the finger with a soft handkerchief, dipping it in pure hot\r\nwater, and then thoroughly and gently cleansing the entire buccal\r\ncavity. The spray of a saturated solution of boracic acid in\r\nrose-water may then be directed over the parts.\r\n\r\nApplications of cool and iced water to the skin are commonly grateful,\r\nand, as a rule, are accompanied by no danger to the patient, though in\r\nthe early periods of the disease they unquestionably retard the full\r\nevolution of the cutaneous symptoms. For the pain in the back,\r\ntherefore, which is often the most urgent symptom of the invasion\r\nstage of the disease, it is usually preferable to make hot\r\napplications. The large rubber bags now in common use, filled with hot\r\nwater and from time to time applied to the lumbar region, may be\r\nemployed with good effect simultaneously with iced, spirituous, or\r\ncamphorated applications to the head.\r\n\r\nNumerous indeed have been the topical applications made to the surface\r\nof the skin in the pustular stage of the malady, both with a view to\r\nassuage the soreness and pain and to obviate the tendency to pitting.\r\nThe opening of the pustules and the evacuation of their contents\r\n(practicable only in other than confluent forms of the disease) has\r\nbeen practised from an early date, but is ineffectual from the\r\nstandpoint of any practical results thus obtainable. The same may be\r\nsaid of the subsequent cauterization of the floor of the pustular\r\nchamber, which only adds to the distress experienced by the sufferer\r\nin his skin. Medicated unguents, applied to the skin, containing\r\nmercury, iodine, and other substances, are not known to be followed by\r\nany better results. It may indeed be laid down as a general rule that\r\nfatty applications to pus-producing surfaces where the pathological\r\nproduct is virulent are apt to undergo decomposition and otherwise act\r\nunfavorably upon the tissues--a fact first pointed out by Ricord in\r\nconnection with the treatment of the {453} chancroid. Vaseline, as not\r\nliable to undergo chemical decomposition, is not open to this\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nCurschmann, Kaposi, and other authors are in agreement respecting the\r\nvalue of water-compresses over the surfaces invaded by the eruption--a\r\nmethod of topical treatment which I desire to fully endorse after\r\npersonal observation of its value. Curschmann recommends compresses\r\ndipped in iced, Kaposi those moistened with tepid water. The sensation\r\nexperienced by the patient will prove the best guide to the\r\ntemperature of this fluid. I prefer a solution containing one drachm\r\nof boracic acid to the pint of water as hot as can be discovered to be\r\nproductive of comfort, a drachm or two of glycerine being added to the\r\nsolution. The compresses dipped in this (or a carbolated solution, if\r\nthe latter is preferred by either physician or patient) should be\r\nassiduously moistened and changed regularly by the attendants just as\r\nlong as they can accomplish good. They operate, first, by protecting\r\nthe part; second, by keeping it moist; third, by maintaining the\r\nsurface temperature at the point most pleasant to the patient; fourth,\r\nby exercising the gentlest degree of equable compression over the\r\nsurface. When desired, this may be covered with the Lister protective\r\nmaterial or a piece of oiled silk to prevent evaporation at the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna warm baths, administered either by the process of continuous\r\nimmersion so generally practised there or by immersion for from two to\r\nthree hours of each day, have been found to furnish the greatest\r\namount of comfort to the patient. The skin is thus speedily relieved\r\nof its tension, the exfoliation of the crusts is hastened, and the\r\ntime required for the evolution of the cutaneous lesions, if not\r\nshortened, is at least not retarded by the accidents of exposure to\r\nthe desiccating influences of the air--ends which for the patient are\r\npractically one. In this country, and especially in private practice\r\noutside the larger charities with their ampler provision for these\r\nemergencies, nearly the same result may be reached by wrapping the\r\npatient completely in sheets wrung out of water of the temperature\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last in the treatment of variola, all indications should\r\nbe made subordinate to that most prominently set forth by the general\r\ncharacter of the symptoms--viz. the conservation by every possible\r\nmeans of the vigor of the patient. The tax upon all reserves of vital\r\nenergy is here so enormous and constant that he will gravely err who\r\nfor a moment loses sight of this fact. Hence it is that anodynes,\r\nchloral, opium and its alkaloids, the bromide of potassium, and\r\nsimilar medicaments, introduced either by the stomach or by hypodermic\r\ninjection, are to be jealously reserved for emergencies when it would\r\nseem cruel to withhold the temporary comfort they may impart.\r\nStimulants are of course to be freely employed whenever they are\r\nindicated by exhaustion as this may be shown by a weak pulse and other\r\nfailing functions of the body, but are certainly best reserved for\r\nsuch emergencies. In general, it may be remarked that the fewer the\r\nmedicaments ingested by the stomach, and the larger the restriction of\r\nthe labor of this organ to the task of sustaining the nutrition of the\r\nbody, the better are the chances of a favorable issue.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to add that all other indications presented in any\r\ngiven case are to be met, subject to the conditions indicated above.\r\nAbscesses {454} are to be opened and antiseptically treated; delirious\r\npatients are to be sedulously prevented from doing themselves injury;\r\ndaily movements of the bowels are to be secured; while the diarrhoea\r\nof the typhoid state, occasionally resulting from the exhausted\r\ncondition of the system when the force of the disease is spent,\r\ndemands proper control.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is to be enforced by every judicious measure. The skin of\r\nthe patient is to be washed in tepid water and soap as often as\r\npracticable in the course of the disease, and under no circumstances\r\nare applications of ointments, washes, or lotions to be allowed to\r\ncollect in strata upon the surface commingled with the pus and crusts\r\nof the disease. At the time of such ablution, and occasionally\r\noftener, the linen and other garments of the patient are to be\r\nchanged. When the crusts are regularly exfoliating from the surface of\r\nthe body general warm baths may be ordered, after each of which the\r\nsurface of the body may be anointed with vaseline or covered with a\r\nfinely-sifted dusting-powder, such as the corn-starch farina sold by\r\ngrocers.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as hemorrhagic variola is usually hopeless in character, and\r\nremedilessly fatal, Kaposi's liberal use of opiates may be recommended\r\nwhen euthanasia is all that can be expected. So long as there is the\r\nnarrowest chance of recovery resort may be had to ergot, turpentine\r\nand the mineral acids internally, combined with the external use of\r\nstyptics and ice. But little confidence can, however, be placed in\r\nthese measures, which will prove entirely ineffective in the great\r\nmajority of all cases.\r\n\r\nIn all fatal cases of variola the duties of the physician are not\r\nended by the death of the patient. It is for the benefit of the living\r\nthat he should require destruction or disinfection and long disuse of\r\nall domestic articles that were employed upon or about the patient.\r\nThe lifeless body should be disposed of by cremation, and medical men\r\nshould exert their influence in favor of legal enforcement of such a\r\nwholesome practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{455}\r\n\r\nVACCINIA.\r\n\r\nBY FRANK P. FOSTER, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Vaccina, Variolæ vaccinæ (Jenner), Cow-pox, Cow-pock,\r\nKine-pox, Kine-pock; _Fr._ Vaccine; _Ger._ Kuhpocken, Schutzpocken,\r\nImpfpocken, Schutzblattern; _It._ Vaccina; _Sp._ Vacuna.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An eruptive disease characterized by a cutaneous lesion\r\nclosely resembling that of small-pox, going through the stages of\r\npapulation, vesiculation, pustulation, incrustation, and\r\ncicatrization; differing from small-pox in the mildness or almost\r\ntotal absence of the constitutional symptoms, by being communicable\r\nonly by inoculation, and by the fact that the lesions, as a rule, are\r\ndeveloped only at the points of inoculation and in their immediate\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nThis definition holds good for the great majority of cases, but in\r\neach of its parts we must take account of exceptions. For example, the\r\nlesion does not always follow the regular sequence of changes\r\ndescribed. It may stop short at the stage of papulation, constituting\r\nthe so-called raspberry excrescence, which will be further referred to\r\nhereafter; it may pass directly from the stage of vesiculation into\r\nthat of incrustation, without any such change in its liquid contents\r\nas can properly be said to form a pustule; desquamation may take the\r\nplace of incrustation; and, after an evolution otherwise normal, there\r\nmay be no formation of a scar, simply because the destructive effect\r\nof the lesion has not extended deeper than the epidermis. The\r\nconstitutional symptoms are sometimes severe, but they are always of\r\nvery short duration. The disease is said to have been communicated\r\notherwise than by inoculation in the case of some of the lower\r\nanimals. Thus, Chauveau succeeded in producing some of its phenomena\r\nin the horse by causing the virus to be inhaled in the form of spray.\r\nIt is doubtful, however, if it is possible to eliminate all sources of\r\nfallacy in such experiments. Finally, a generalized eruption is\r\noccasionally observed, although with great rarity. In stating these\r\nexceptions no reference is intended to cases in which complications\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE DISEASE.--Many considerations warrant us in classing\r\ncow-pox among the varioliform diseases--chiefly its general\r\nresemblance to variola, and the fact that individuals who have been\r\naffected by it are thereby more or less fully protected against\r\nsmall-pox. It has been thought, indeed, that cow-pox was in reality\r\nbut a modified form of small-pox; and this idea has been the basis of\r\none of the theories that have been held as to the origin of vaccinia.\r\nBefore enumerating and discussing those theories it will be well to\r\nmention that cow-pox is spoken of as spontaneous, casual, or\r\ninoculated, according to its mode of origin, known or assumed, in\r\nindividual instances.\r\n\r\n{456} Spontaneous or original cow-pox is the name commonly applied to\r\nthe disease as it is met with in the cow in instances in which its\r\nmode of origin is unknown. Strictly interpreted, this expression\r\nimplies a belief that the affection is capable of being developed in a\r\ncow independently of contagion or infection--a notion that seems to be\r\nheld by many physicians, but not, so far as the writer is aware, by\r\nthose whose study of the subject has been such as to lend any\r\nconsiderable weight to their opinions. Ordinarily, however, the term\r\nspontaneous cow-pox is employed simply as a convenient expression to\r\ndenote the disease as it occurs naturally in cows, without implying\r\nany belief or theory as to its mode of origin.\r\n\r\nCasual cow-pox is the term applied in cases that have been contracted\r\nby accidental inoculation, whether in the cow or in man. It is\r\nmanifest that the so-called spontaneous cases are really casual,\r\nunless we accept the doctrine that infection is not necessary to the\r\ndevelopment of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe term inoculated cow-pox implies that the affection has been\r\nproduced by intentional inoculation. Here, again, we are confronted\r\nwith an illogical expression, for a disease that is inoculated\r\naccidentally is still inoculated, as much as if it had been conveyed\r\npurposely. It may be said, indeed, that the casual disease is due to\r\nsome other form of infection than inoculation, but for such an\r\nassertion there is not a particle of proof.\r\n\r\nPassing from this unsatisfactory nomenclature to a consideration of\r\nthe theories that have been held as to the nature of cow-pox, we are\r\nfirst met with that of its being a disease sui generis, like\r\nsmall-pox, measles, scarlet fever, and the like, and, like them,\r\noriginating only by its own specific contagion, not being capable of\r\ndevelopment by a modification of any other contagion, however closely\r\nit may thus be counterfeited. This seems the most rational theory of\r\nthe nature of cow-pox, but it cannot be demonstrated except by\r\ndisproving all opposing theories; and that has not yet been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nAnother theory is, that cow-pox is really small-pox modified, as the\r\nphrase runs, \"by passing through the system of the cow.\" It has been\r\nthought possible, indeed, to specify in what way the cow's system\r\ncould impress such decided changes upon the virulent disease small-pox\r\nas to convert it into the mild affection that we know as vaccinia; in\r\nother words, it has been imagined that the function of lactation\r\naccomplished this remarkable result. This notion may have been due to\r\nthe observation that so-called spontaneous cow-pox is met with only in\r\ncows that are in milk. The significance of this fact, however, is\r\nreally nothing more than that cows in milk are more exposed to\r\naccidental inoculation than other bovine animals--namely, at the hands\r\nof the milkers. The fact that in such cases the lesions are almost\r\nalways confined to the teats and the udder, far from affording any\r\nground for the notion that there is some mysterious connection between\r\ncow-pox and the function of lactation, is but another proof that the\r\ndisease is the result of inoculation. The lesions appear at the points\r\nof inoculation, the teats and the udder being the parts handled by the\r\nmilkers. Moreover, there is no difficulty in inoculating young calves\r\nor adult bulls, and the lesions so produced do not vary in a single\r\nparticular from those observed in so-called spontaneous cases.\r\n\r\n{457} Men have been so carried away with this milk theory, however, as\r\neven to believe that the virus of small-pox might be shorn of its\r\ndangerous properties, so that it would produce only the vaccinal\r\nlesion when inoculated simply by mechanical mixture with milk. During\r\nthe late Civil War one of the Confederate Army surgeons actually put\r\nthis notion to the test of practice on quite a large scale,\r\ninoculating large numbers of persons with a mixture of small-pox virus\r\nand milk, terming the practice mitigated inoculation. We can scarcely\r\nsuppose that he did anything else than variolate these persons, just\r\nas he would have done had he used variolous lymph without the addition\r\nof milk. His experiments show nothing new; they merely furnish a\r\nrecent confirmation of the well-known fact, familiar to the old\r\ninoculators, that inoculated small-pox is sometimes exceedingly mild\r\nin a series of cases.\r\n\r\nThis theory of the variolous origin of cow-pox, and of the\r\npracticability of converting small-pox into cow-pox at will by\r\n\"passing it through the system of the cow,\" has taken deep root in the\r\nminds of men, especially in Great Britain, where the late Mr. Ceely's\r\nexperiments and Mr. Badcock's experience seemed to give it some color.\r\nSome years ago, however, the question was investigated most\r\npractically and thoroughly by a commission appointed for the purpose\r\nby one of the medical societies of Lyons, Chauveau being the recorder.\r\nTheir conclusion was--and their reasoning seems to the present writer\r\nincontrovertible--that small-pox and cow-pox were wholly distinct from\r\neach other under all circumstances, and that it was impossible to\r\nconvert the one into the other. But the doctrines of the English\r\ninvestigators, reinforced as they were by the ingenious arguments of\r\nthe late Dr. Seaton, were not easily to be overturned in their own\r\ncountry or in America; consequently, the practice of variolating cows\r\nhas been resorted to from time to time for the purpose of obtaining a\r\nstock of vaccinal virus of unquestionable authenticity--the so-called\r\nvariola vaccine. This practice is utterly fallacious, and it is also\r\ndangerous, since the disease so produced, however mild it may seem to\r\nbe, is nothing more nor less than small-pox, with its infectiousness\r\nby effluvium and its liability to prove serious even when carefully\r\ninoculated.\r\n\r\nQuite recently the experimental investigation of the question has been\r\nundertaken de novo by a well-known English veterinarian, Mr. Fleming;\r\nand, since his conclusions coincide with those of the Lyonnese\r\ncommission, it is to be hoped that we have seen the last of this\r\nrough-and-ready method of improvising a case of genuine cow-pox--a\r\nmethod that, in the light of our present knowledge, can only be\r\ncharacterized as downright malpractice.\r\n\r\nThe third and last theory we have to consider is that which ascribes\r\nthe origin of cow-pox to infection from the horse. So far back as\r\nJenner's time it was conjectured that cow-pox was due to the\r\naccidental conveyance of the virus of the grease (the eaux-aux-jambes\r\nof the French) by reason of the cows being milked by persons who were\r\nalso employed in the care of horses affected with that disease. Grease\r\nis an eruptive disease of horses' heels. Doubtless it has often been\r\nconfounded with a mere eczematous affection by those who have\r\nrepeatedly failed in their persistent attempts to inoculate cows with\r\nit, and, on the other hand, a localized eruption of horse-pox may have\r\nbeen mistaken for it by those who have {458} supposed themselves to\r\nhave succeeded in producing cow-pox by inoculating cows with the virus\r\nof grease, and have consequently given in their adhesion to the grease\r\ntheory of the origin of cow-pox. At all events, so far as the writer\r\nis aware, that theory is not now held by any well-informed writer.\r\n\r\nStill regarding the horse as the originator of cow-pox, we must turn\r\nour attention to horse-pox (equinia). Several years ago Depaul of\r\nParis took great pains to establish the fact that horse-pox (an\r\naffection totally distinct from grease) was an eruptive febrile\r\ndisease of horses, an exanthem; that the eruption was generalized,\r\nand, being for the most part concealed by the hair, generally\r\noverlooked; and that it was capable of being conveyed by inoculation,\r\nthe lesion being indistinguishable from that of cow-pox. He believed\r\nhimself to have demonstrated also that it was the contagion of\r\nhorse-pox that gave rise to cow-pox in the cow.\r\n\r\nDepaul's investigations were very keen and his conclusions were\r\nexceedingly plausible, but they cannot be called convincing,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that Constantin Paul succeeded for a time in\r\npopularizing a stock of horse-pox virus as material for vaccination.\r\nAt about the same time the Beaugency case of cow-pox was discovered,\r\nand the perfectly satisfactory use that has been made of that stock\r\nmay have thrown Depaul's theories and Paul's practice undeservedly\r\ninto the background.\r\n\r\nWe can only say, in summing up, that the small-pox theory is utterly\r\nuntenable, that the horse-pox theory has not been disproved, and that\r\nthe theory that regards cow-pox as derived neither from small-pox nor\r\nfrom horse-pox, but as a disease sui generis, although not proved, is\r\nthe most rational of all, and the most in keeping with known facts.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Nearly everything that could be said under this head has\r\nalready been considered. It may be added that meteorological\r\nconditions have been supposed to favor the prevalence of the disease\r\namong cows. More precise observations are needed to enable us to\r\ndetermine whether or not there is any truth in this supposition. It\r\nhas been said that the affection is most apt to prevail during warm\r\nand moist seasons. This is contrary to what we might have imagined, as\r\nwarmth and moisture are quite destructive of the vaccinal virus. Under\r\nordinary circumstances, however, the contagium often proves\r\nwonderfully tenacious of life, and the disease, once introduced among\r\na herd of cows, is prone to linger for months, or even years,\r\nattacking animals recently added to the stock and young cows during\r\ntheir first lactation. As has already been stated, age, sex, and\r\nparturition can be regarded as etiological factors only in so far as\r\nthey favor the occurrence of accidental inoculation. In the human\r\nsubject vaccinia occurs generally as the result of intentional\r\ninoculation, as will be more fully referred to when we come to the\r\nconsideration of vaccination. Insusceptibility is occasionally met\r\nwith, both in the cow and in man, but it is very rare. Perhaps it may\r\nbe explained in some instances by the subject having really had the\r\ndisease, or indeed small-pox, either before or after birth, in so mild\r\na form as not to have left the characteristic marks. Certain it is\r\nthat the lesion does not always leave a permanent scar, especially in\r\nthe cow.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COURSE OF THE DISEASE.--This is best studied in cases that\r\nhave followed intentional inoculation, for here we know the {459}\r\nchronological sequence of events. Depending somewhat upon the method\r\nof inoculation, and perhaps also to some extent upon the state of the\r\nskin at the site of the inoculation, or even upon a systemic condition\r\n(since some vaccinators hail it as a harbinger of success), at the\r\ntime of the operation a ring-like erythema may be seen surrounding the\r\ninoculation. This is exceedingly evanescent, being doubtless due to\r\nvaso-motor action, and is not often witnessed.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, no effect whatever is observed until after the lapse of\r\ntwo or three days, when a red papule is formed. This papule increases\r\nin superficial area, but not in height, and gradually loses its\r\nredness. It assumes a circular form, or, in the case of a compound\r\npock (for that is the proper name for the lesion), a configuration\r\nrepresenting segments of several circles, and as it increases in area\r\nit becomes more and more raised at the border (the bourrelet of French\r\nwriters), while the central portion, which also increases in size pari\r\npassu with the peripheral annular vesicle, does not become more\r\nelevated, but remains depressed, giving the pock as a whole the\r\npeculiar shape termed umbilication. Up to the eighth or tenth day,\r\ninclusive, the marginal elevation contains a limpid fluid termed\r\nlymph, and consequently presents a pearl-like lustre. At this period a\r\nrather sudden increase takes place in the corpuscular elements\r\ncontained in the lymph, causing that liquid to become thick and\r\nopaque, so that the elevated margin of the pock, which before had\r\nshown the pearl-like lustre alluded to, now comes to look as if made\r\nof tallow.\r\n\r\nAt the same time what is known as the areola forms around the pock,\r\nand constitutional symptoms show themselves. The areola is a\r\ncircumscribed redness of the skin, perfectly circular in form and of\r\nfive or six times the diameter of the pock itself. It is sharply\r\ndefined and of a vivid red hue. Usually it is a mere hyperæmia of the\r\nskin, but in some instances, especially where the process of\r\npock-formation is decidedly pronounced, a few papillary elevations are\r\nto be seen in the immediate neighborhood of the pock, and at that\r\nsituation there may also be some lividity. After a few hours'\r\npersistence in the form of a disc the areola begins to disappear, the\r\nredness fading first at the central portion, so that in its declining\r\nstage it assumes the shape of a ring which constantly grows narrower\r\nand narrower at the expense of its inner portion, and finally\r\ndisappears altogether. In the cow the areola is only a faint line\r\nimmediately around the pock.\r\n\r\nConstitutional symptoms are invariably present in cases that follow\r\nthe regular course. The temperature rises one or two degrees\r\nFahrenheit, the appetite becomes impaired, and sleep is somewhat\r\ndisturbed. In many cases, mostly those of secondary inoculation, the\r\nsymptoms are more severe; the fever runs higher, and may be\r\naccompanied with transient delirium; nausea is experienced, perhaps\r\nwith actual vomiting; and severe pain is felt in the head and along\r\nthe spine, the latter being most marked in the cervical region. These\r\nsymptoms usually last but a few hours, and they are apt to be\r\naccompanied by a modification of the areola whereby it loses its\r\ndisc-like outline and becomes diffused irregularly, especially, if, as\r\nis usual, the inoculation has been done on the arm, in a downward\r\ndirection toward the elbow.\r\n\r\nAlong with these phenomena intense itching is often felt at the\r\nsituation of the pock, being an aggravation of the pruritus that in a\r\nmild {460} form accompanies the greater part of the whole course of\r\nthe lesion. Supposing the arm to have been inoculated, the lymphatic\r\nglands of the axilla now become swollen and tender, but their\r\nsuppuration is unusual, and is to be regarded as a complication.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the pock: some time before the contents of the marginal\r\nelevation become opaque the central portion is converted into a crust\r\nof a brownish color, and finally, from the tenth to the fifteenth day,\r\nthe bourrelet itself, having ceased to increase in size, takes part in\r\nthe process of incrustation, the completed crust representing the form\r\nof the pock, having a circular ridge at the border, at which part its\r\ncolor is not so deep as at the centre. The crust usually falls off\r\nbetween the fifteenth and the thirty-fifth day. It is hard,\r\ntranslucent, and of a prune-juice color; thick at the centre and thin\r\nat the periphery; smooth on its attached surface and somewhat wrinkled\r\non its outer aspect; surmounted at the centre by the epidermal débris\r\nproduced by the operation of inoculation, mingled perhaps with more or\r\nless dried blood.\r\n\r\nAfter the crust falls off a reddened surface is left of a cicatricial\r\nnature, usually somewhat depressed below the level of the surrounding\r\nskin, and frequently showing lesser pits, which latter appearance is\r\ntermed foveolation. Instead of these pits, radiated striæ are\r\nfrequently left. Gradually the scar loses its red color, and, like\r\nother scars, finally becomes paler than the surrounding skin. It is\r\nusually permanent.\r\n\r\nIRREGULARITIES IN THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE.--Ever since cow-pox first\r\nbecame the subject of medical study deviations from its typical course\r\nhave been noticed, and have been the theme of a good deal of\r\nspeculation. The older writers, indeed, bestowed no little attention\r\nupon what they considered to be not irregular forms of vaccinia, but\r\ndistinct affections with which it was liable to be confounded. Their\r\ndescriptions of these diseases, which they termed spurious cow-pox,\r\nare, however, so vague as to possess but little more than an\r\nhistorical interest. In regard to affections met with casually in the\r\ncow, we can often determine their nature only by test-inoculations,\r\nand even that criterion is not always thoroughly convincing; for, on\r\none account or another, we may fail in the attempt to propagate true\r\ncow-pox, and on the other hand, if we admit that there is a radical\r\ndifference between cow-pox and small-pox, it is manifest, bearing in\r\nmind the errors into which experienced investigators have fallen, that\r\nwe may propagate small-pox through a long series of experiments\r\nwithout once suspecting it to be anything but cow-pox. We may,\r\nnevertheless, always determine, provided we succeed at all, whether we\r\nare dealing with a disease that protects against vaccinal and\r\nvariolous inoculation.\r\n\r\nIn the human subject we seldom meet with affections that counterfeit\r\nvaccinia, although, if we take only the lesion into consideration,\r\nthere are certain contagious forms of herpes that may give rise to\r\ndoubt, and possibly the same may be true of impetigo contagiosa.\r\n\r\nTurning, then, to the irregularities properly so called, we have first\r\nto consider the absence of constitutional infection. This must not be\r\nconfounded with the mere lack of obvious constitutional symptoms; what\r\nis meant by the expression is, that in certain instances the local\r\nlesion may appear typical, and yet no such impression be made upon the\r\nsystem as to render it proof against subsequent inoculation. Early in\r\nthe {461} century the possibility of this lack of systemic infection\r\nwas insisted upon by Mr. Bryce of Edinburgh, who invoked it as an\r\nexplanation of the occasional failure of vaccinia to protect against\r\nsmall-pox. The practical question was, how to decide, in a given\r\ninstance, whether general infection had or had not taken place. In the\r\nopinion of many observers--and that notion has cropped out every now\r\nand then up to the present day--absence of the areola furnished at\r\nleast presumptive evidence that the constitution had eluded infection.\r\nBut, whatever may be held theoretically, it must be conceded either\r\nthat the general system very rarely fails to feel the impress of the\r\ndisease, or else that the criterion is fallacious. For in an\r\nexperience of seventeen years the present writer has not known of a\r\nsingle instance in which a vaccinal lesion that pursued a regular\r\ncourse in other respects has failed to be accompanied by the areola.\r\nAnd certainly Mr. Bryce himself must have attached little if any\r\nimportance to it, for he took great pains to establish a means of\r\ndetermining the presence or absence of constitutional infection--the\r\nso-called Bryce's test. This consists in repeating the inoculation at\r\na certain period in the evolution of the disease, the theory being\r\nthat systemic infection does not take place at once, but only after\r\nthe lapse of a number of days from the time of the inoculation. Up to\r\nthat time a repetition of the inoculation is possible, and, if\r\nsystemic infection results from the first one, both lesions will\r\nmature at the same time, the second one following an accelerated\r\ncourse, reaching its acme rapidly, although dwarfed in size. If, on\r\nthe other hand, the first inoculation failed to infect the\r\nconstitution, the second one will pursue its course in the usual\r\nmanner. Moreover, at a certain time, generally about the fifth day, a\r\nrepetition of the inoculation will fail altogether if the original\r\ninsertion has really infected the system. The present writer can\r\ntestify that Mr. Bryce's statements are correct; he has applied the\r\ntest in many cases, but in no instance has he been led to the\r\nconclusion that constitutional infection had failed to take place. He\r\nis inclined to think, therefore, that such failure is exceedingly\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nPassing over the multiplicity of irregularities in the lesion that\r\nwere described by the older observers, it seems that there are a few\r\nthat are of practical importance. In the first place, there is a\r\nvariety of pock to which it is not easy to give a definite name, but\r\nwhich is characterized by a lack of decided elevation above the\r\nsurrounding skin (a deficiency for which it makes up in superficial\r\narea), by the early formation of a thin, flimsy, straw-colored crust,\r\nand by the utter failure of the characteristic firm brown crust of the\r\ntypical variety to become developed. This form of irregular pock has\r\nnot been seen by the writer of late years, but before animal\r\nvaccination came into general use he met with it frequently, mostly in\r\ncachectic children. Notwithstanding its sprawly, unsatisfactory\r\nappearance, it is undoubtedly genuine, for the typical lesion may be\r\nproduced by inoculation with its contents.\r\n\r\nAnother irregularity of the pock is what is familiarly termed the\r\nraspberry excrescence. A red elevation forms at the seat of\r\ninoculation, and at first promises to follow the typical course,\r\nalthough it may be tardy in making it appearance; but it never\r\nadvances to full development. It becomes indolent, and may last for\r\nseveral weeks, or even months, in the form of a hard, flat nodule of a\r\nbright-red color, not unlike a small {462} nævus. In many instances it\r\nhas a succulent look, but no lymph can be obtained on puncturing it.\r\nNo areola appears at any time, and finally the lesion slowly\r\ndisappears, leaving no trace of its existence. It is probably an\r\nabortive form of pock, in which only the papillary layer of the skin\r\ntakes part, without any exudation into the epidermis. It is seldom, if\r\never, protective against small-pox, for it constitutes no bar to a\r\nsubsequent vaccination. This irregular pock has been observed from\r\ntime to time ever since the early days of vaccination, but for the\r\npast six years it has been seen more frequently in New York than for\r\nmany years before. Now, however, it seems to be growing less common.\r\nThe writer is not aware of any satisfactory explanation of its\r\noccurrence. It is seen in all sorts of subjects, and seems to follow\r\nthe use of one variety of virus as much as the employment of any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhat has been termed generalized vaccinia is another form of\r\nirregularity. The expression is a vague one, covering as it does not\r\nonly the very rare cases of true eruptive vaccinia, in which a general\r\neruption of pocks takes place as a consequence of constitutional\r\ninfection, playing the part of an exanthem, but in addition those\r\ninstances, not very uncommon, in which pocks are formed here and there\r\non the body, probably as the result of the accidental transfer of the\r\nvirus from the pock by scratching. Under such favorable\r\nconditions--the immediate transfer of lymph from a pock in which the\r\nspecific evolution is going on vigorously--the slightest penetration\r\nof the epidermis with the nails is enough to secure self-inoculation.\r\nIn view of this facility with which it may be effected, we should be\r\nvery careful not to jump hastily to the conclusion that in any given\r\ncase of generalized vaccinia the supplementary pocks are truly\r\neruptive; as a matter of fact, the present writer has never seen an\r\ninstance in which he was convinced that such was the case. Where the\r\npocks are very numerous, especially in subjects with an irritable\r\nskin, much distress may be caused by the itching and by the\r\nconsequences of scratching, and marked febrile reaction may accompany\r\nthe process; so that, in view of the great similarity of the lesions\r\nto those of the variolous eruption, much doubt is sometimes\r\nentertained as to whether the disease is not really small-pox. This\r\nquestion cannot always be definitely settled at first, but the failure\r\nof the secondary fever of small-pox, together with the fact that the\r\ndisease does not spread by infection, will generally suffice to decide\r\nit.\r\n\r\nConcerning those cases of generalized vaccinia that are manifestly not\r\neruptive, it sometimes happens that the cutaneous receptivity is not\r\nexhausted for several weeks, or even months. Such cases set Bryce's\r\ntest at defiance, in consequence, probably, of an idiosyncrasy. In\r\nsome of these instances the pocks appear in clusters of successive\r\nformation, looking not unlike patches of zoster. Small supplementary\r\npocks in the immediate neighborhood of the original lesion are not at\r\nall uncommon.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Avoiding the minute histological details for\r\nwhich the prescribed length of this article gives no scope, but little\r\nis to be added to what has already been said in the section on the\r\nclinical features of the disease. The lesions of vaccinia are wholly\r\ncutaneous. Confining ourselves to cases that follow a regular course,\r\nthere is, indeed, but one, the pock--a term that seems preferable to\r\nvesicle and {463} pustule, since the latter apply only during certain\r\nphases in the development of the lesion.\r\n\r\nA pock may be regarded as essentially a lesion of the epidermis, for\r\nit is in that structure that its most striking features are developed,\r\nand in some cases, although doubtless the papillary layer of the derma\r\nis congested, there is no permanent alteration of tissue below the\r\nMalpighian layer of the epidermis. These are the catarrhal pocks of\r\nRindfleisch, and it is in such cases, if in any, that no scar (even of\r\ntemporary duration) results. The term catarrhal pock, however, is not\r\nvitiated by an extension of the morbid process deep enough to produce\r\na permanent cicatrix, and it is probable that in most cases the\r\ncatarrhal type predominates. By the term diphtheritic pock the same\r\nauthor refers to cases in which the congestion of the papillary layer\r\nis so intense as to block the supply of blood to the apices of the\r\npapillæ, as a result of which they become exsanguinated and necrosed,\r\nforming a white pultaceous layer on the floor of the pock, which is\r\nundoubtedly what Ceely referred to when he spoke of a false membrane.\r\nIn some cases even the subcutaneous tissue undergoes necrosis, a sort\r\nof core being included in the substance of the crust that ultimately\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nWhichever of these forms of pock we take into consideration, always\r\nexcluding irregularities and complications, we find certain definite\r\nchanges in the epidermis. The dome of the pock is formed by the\r\nunbroken transparent horny layer of the epidermis, unaffected by the\r\nmorbid process. The cavity of the pock is formed by the squamous cells\r\nof the epidermis being forced out of their normal relations by an\r\nexudation of lymph between them, some of them being tilted up edgewise\r\nwhile still retaining their connection with the surrounding cells,\r\nthus accounting for the multilocular structure of the pock; for it is\r\na fact that the circular bourrelet consists not of one ring-like\r\ncavity, but of many separate chambers. The result of this structure\r\nis, that the liquid contained within the pock--the lymph--escapes only\r\npartly through a puncture made in the wall of the vesicle. In order to\r\nevacuate the pock thoroughly it is necessary to make a great number of\r\npunctures or a circular incision following the ring-like ridge of the\r\nbourrelet.\r\n\r\nThe lymph contained within the cells of the pock is a liquid which in\r\nits gross physical properties differs but little from the lymph which\r\nexudes from any traumatic surface shortly after the injury has been\r\ninflicted, as in the glazing process that takes place in wounds.\r\nExamined microscopically, however, it is found to contain not only the\r\nfibrin, the salts, the corpuscular elements, and the débris that\r\nordinary tissue-juice presents, but also certain minute spherical\r\nbodies--termed microspheres, microzymes, vaccinads, etc.--that give it\r\nits characteristic infective quality and justify the title of virus\r\ncommonly applied to it. That these minute bodies really constitute the\r\nvirulent element of the lymph, or at least that they are the vehicle\r\nof the contagium, is not a mere matter of conjecture, but has been\r\ndemonstrated abundantly, notably by Chauveau and Sanderson's diffusion\r\nexperiments. Inoculation with the supernatant liquid, containing none\r\nof these bodies, always fails to convey the disease, but it is not\r\nabsolutely essential that they should be present in large proportion\r\nin the lymph to render the latter virulent, for Chauveau found that\r\nlymph diluted with thirty times its bulk of water was not without\r\ninfective {464} power. It scarcely need be said, however, that the\r\ngreater the proportion in which they are present, the greater is the\r\nprobability that the lymph will prove infective on inoculation. These\r\nbodies have been supposed to be of a vegetable nature, and Hallier,\r\nKohn, and others have bestowed no little study upon their botanical\r\ncharacteristics. Under favorable circumstances they retain their\r\nvirulent properties for a long time, especially if kept perfectly dry\r\nand not subjected to a high temperature. The present writer has met\r\nwith success in the use of vaccinal virus seven years old.\r\n\r\nThe lymph differs somewhat in its gross appearances according as it is\r\nproduced in man or in the bovine animal. In the former it is clear and\r\nlimpid, and exudes freely in great drops when the pock is punctured in\r\nits peripheral portion; in the latter it is more straw-colored and\r\nmore viscid, exuding sluggishly, or even refusing to flow without the\r\naid of pressure. Moreover, the vaccinads seem endowed with different\r\nproperties in the two cases: in man they have a tendency to remain\r\nequably diffused through the liquid, while in the cow they tend to\r\nseparate from it and to be deposited upon any solid surface at hand.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon termed umbilication, common to the vaccinal pock and to\r\nthat of variola, has given rise to some differences of opinion as to\r\nthe mechanism of its production. The term implies a depression at the\r\ncentre of the pock. This appearance is not invariable, but it is\r\nconstant enough to have met with general acceptance as a\r\ncharacteristic feature, notwithstanding the undoubted fact that it is\r\nfound in lesions that have nothing whatever to do with any of the\r\nvarioliform diseases. Not to waste space in discussing the various\r\ntheories that have found supporters, it may be said that they have all\r\nbeen proved to be defective, save only the simple explanation that as\r\nthe process of evolution advances the centre of the pock undergoes\r\ndesiccation, whereby that portion of the tissue involved is so glued\r\nand drawn together as to become incapable of the swelling that is\r\nstill going on in the growing peripheral portion of the lesion.\r\n\r\nThe crust into which the pock ultimately becomes converted is not, as\r\nis commonly supposed, mere dried lymph and nothing else; it is dried\r\ntissue enclosing concrete lymph. It generally includes also various\r\nsorts of débris--broken-down epithelium, blood-corpuscles,\r\npus-corpuscles, and even, in rare cases, a core of sphacelated tissue\r\nlike that of a furuncle.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, the cicatrix is to a certain extent peculiar\r\nin that it is usually depressed and foveolated. Too much stress has\r\nbeen laid upon these features, however, and the truth is that some\r\ntraumatic scars cannot be distinguished readily from that of vaccinia,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, many a genuine pock leaves no permanent\r\ntrace behind it. Indeed, in the cow it is the exception for a\r\nnoteworthy scar to form.\r\n\r\nSEQUELÆ AND COMPLICATIONS.--The most important sequela of vaccinia is\r\nthe fact that it protects the subject against small-pox, and on that\r\ncircumstance hinges the chief practical interest of the disease. This\r\nleads us at once to the subject of vaccination, and therefore under\r\nthat head we shall pursue our consideration of this curious affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n{465} Vaccination.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--\"The new inoculation;\" _Fr._ Vaccination; _Ger._\r\nKuhpockenimpfung, Schutzpockenimpfung; _It._ Vaccinazione; _Sp._\r\nVacunacion.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--Before giving the history of vaccination itself (meaning by\r\nthat term the intentional inoculation of vaccinia for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the subject against small-pox), it may be well to devote a\r\nfew words to a practice that preceded it--that of the intentional\r\ninoculation of small-pox (or simply inoculation, latterly called\r\nvariolation). In very early times various Oriental peoples became\r\naware of the fact that small-pox might be very decidedly mitigated by\r\ninoculation. This was practised in various ways, all of which may be\r\nreduced to the process of inserting small-pox virus into a solution of\r\ncontinuity. Lady Montagu, the wife of an English ambassador to Turkey,\r\nbrought the practice back to England with her, where it soon made its\r\nway into popular favor, and whence it spread rapidly over Europe and\r\nAmerica. Thus contracted, small-pox was shorn of a great part of its\r\nterrors; the eruption was usually trifling in amount, and in every way\r\nthe disease was mild as a rule. Still, the mortality was something\r\nworth considering, and, worse than that, the inoculated disease was\r\ncommunicable by effluvium, so that an inoculated person had to be\r\nsecluded carefully for fear of spreading the disease in the ordinary\r\nway. In all cases, too, careful medical treatment was thought\r\nnecessary. On the whole, then, while inoculation was undoubtedly a\r\nboon, it was fraught with many grave perils. So great, indeed, were\r\nthese perils, and so thoroughly were they appreciated, that the\r\npractice was interdicted by law in most civilized countries so soon as\r\nvaccination had become established in popular favor.\r\n\r\nIn several European countries the common people--at least those of\r\nthem who had much to do with dairies--gradually became aware of the\r\nexistence of the disease termed cow-pox, and of the fact that those\r\nindividuals who had accidentally contracted it were rendered proof\r\nagainst the infection of small-pox. There is even fair testimony to\r\nshow that some of these people, particularly the English farmer,\r\nBenjamin Jesty, relying on their observation to this effect, employed\r\nintentional cow-pox inoculation as a protective measure. These facts,\r\nhowever, do not detract in the least from the credit that all\r\nChristendom has awarded to a man who subjected the popular impression\r\nin question to the test of scientific investigation, proved its truth,\r\nand demonstrated its value to the world. That man was Edward Jenner,\r\nan English country physician. It was in the last quarter of the\r\neighteenth century that he entered upon his course of inquiry, and on\r\nthe eve of the present century he published his demonstration to the\r\nworld. It was not a discovery; it was not an invention: it was more\r\nthan either, \"a matchless piece of induction,\" to quote the words of\r\nMr. John Simon. Filled as he must have been with the consciousness of\r\nhis great achievement, Jenner set this good example to all\r\ninvestigators: that he did not make haste to convert the world; he\r\nfirst convinced himself. It may almost be said, indeed, that, like\r\nMinerva from the head of Jove, the rational and perfected practice of\r\nvaccination sprang complete from Jenner's hands. Doubt and ridicule he\r\nhad to encounter at first, and afterward envy and detraction; but the\r\nforce of {466} his facts and the symmetry of his deductions were such\r\nthat the new inoculation soon spread through the broad world, and has\r\never since maintained its sway, save with a few fanatical scoffers.\r\n\r\nThat vaccination really does protect against small-pox observation has\r\ntaught the whole civilized world, if we leave out of account the few\r\nconscientious and intelligent doubters (made such, doubtless, quite as\r\nmuch by the extravagant statements often put forth by those who from\r\ntime to time think it incumbent on them to defend vaccination, as by\r\ntheir own misinterpretation of facts) who are to be found associated\r\nwith the noisy little body of actual opponents of the practice. One of\r\nthe most injurious statements ever made in the advocacy of vaccination\r\nis, that it always protects if properly done. When one of these\r\nillogical defenders of that proposition is confronted with an instance\r\nthat disproves his assertion, he falls back on the allegation that in\r\nthat instance the vaccination was not properly done. The manifest\r\nabsurdity of such an argument strikes the doubter most forcibly, and\r\ninclines him to say to himself, Falsus in uno, falsus in omne.\r\nUnbelief founded on this ground would never have arisen if the plain\r\ntruth had always been adhered to: that the protection afforded by\r\nvaccination is not invariable, and that very often it is not\r\npermanent. In the infancy of the practice these facts were not known,\r\nbut it is now many years since they became obvious to every\r\nfair-minded observer. The misapprehension of facts lies chiefly in the\r\nfalse deduction from the circumstance that the great majority of cases\r\nof small-pox occur in persons who have been vaccinated. But the\r\nexplanation of this is very simple. Suppose that, of one hundred\r\npersons vaccinated, twenty fail to be protected permanently; that all\r\npersons not vaccinated are unprotected; and that throughout the\r\ncivilized world the proportion of vaccinated to unvaccinated persons\r\nis as ninety to ten. Making no pretence of arithmetical accuracy, it\r\nmay certainly be said that all these suppositions are well within the\r\ntruth. It follows from them that in a community of ten thousand\r\npersons there will be nine thousand who have been vaccinated, and one\r\nthousand who have not. Of the former, eighteen hundred will have\r\nfailed to secure lasting protection. Therefore in case of an epidemic\r\nthere will probably be a proportion of eighteen cases of small-pox in\r\nthe vaccinated to ten in the unvaccinated; and yet this should not\r\nobscure the fact that of the nine thousand vaccinated more than seven\r\nthousand were absolutely protected, whereas of the one thousand not\r\nvaccinated not one could escape the disease if exposed to it. When we\r\nadd the further observation that of the eighteen hundred cases of\r\nsmall-pox among the vaccinated not more than thirty or forty would\r\nprobably prove fatal, while of the one thousand cases in the\r\nunvaccinated about two hundred would end in death, we have a striking\r\ndemonstration of the efficiency of vaccination. As a matter of fact,\r\nstatistics show that the figures here given err rather in allowing too\r\nlittle than in asserting too much in favor of vaccinal protection.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, Why it is that vaccination protects\r\nsome persons and does not protect others?--reference being had, of\r\ncourse, to permanent protection, for it is exceedingly rare for\r\ntemporary immunity to be attained if we exclude those instances in\r\nwhich the variolous infection has taken place before the operation is\r\nresorted to. This {467} question cannot be answered with any\r\ncertainty, but various theories have been brought forward, some of\r\nwhich call for notice.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it has been thought that the revolution of the\r\nsystem termed puberty was fraught with such a radical change as to do\r\naway with the mild modification due to vaccination. While this theory\r\nhas an air of plausibility, it seems to lack proof and not to be\r\nupheld by analogy, for we do not find that children who have had\r\nscarlet fever, measles, and the like often undergo those diseases a\r\nsecond time on arriving at the age of puberty.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining theory that our limits will allow a consideration\r\nof is that put forward by Marson of London, that the degree and\r\nduration of vaccinal protection are proportionate to the perfection of\r\nthe vaccinal lesion and to the number of insertions made. In a large\r\nexperience with small-pox Marson found that the disease was more fatal\r\namong those whose vaccinal scars were imperfect or few in number than\r\namong those who bore evidence that several pocks had been produced and\r\nhad run a typical course. As to the influence of a perfect evolution\r\nof the lesion, but little doubt can be entertained, for we have\r\nalready seen that in some instances its course is so different from\r\nwhat it should be that no protection whatever seems to result. When we\r\ncome to consider the number of the pocks as affecting the degree or\r\nthe duration of protection, however, an obvious source of fallacy\r\narises in the fact that we cannot always be sure that some of the\r\nscars on a person having a number of them were not the products of a\r\nrepetition of the operation several years after the first--that is to\r\nsay, a revaccination, the efficiency of which in restoring lost\r\nimmunity is now well established. Nevertheless, as long as the doubt\r\nremains the best course to pursue seems to be to act as if Marson's\r\ntheory were in all respects correct, and vaccinate by multiple\r\ninsertions.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, no positive means of ascertaining who those persons are\r\nthat are likely to fail of lasting protection, or how long a time will\r\nelapse before the cessation of their immunity will take place. The\r\nonly safety lies in revaccination. But after how many years should\r\nrevaccination be resorted to? It has been thought that this question\r\nmight be settled by noting at what age, or at what period after\r\nprimary vaccination, large numbers of people became susceptible of\r\nrevaccination. This test, however, is not altogether trustworthy, for\r\na renewed susceptibility to vaccinia by inoculation does not\r\nnecessarily imply that the liability to take small-pox by effluvium\r\nhas been regained. If it did, modified small-pox (varioloid) would be\r\nfar more common than it is, for it is certain that revaccination can\r\nbe made to succeed in a very large proportion of children long before\r\nthey have reached the age of puberty. The fact is, contrary to the\r\nnotions of the last generation, that success in revaccination is the\r\nrule, not the exception. Formerly it was not expected to succeed, and\r\ntherefore no special pains were taken to ensure success.\r\n\r\nDefinite rules cannot be laid down as to the time that should be\r\nsuffered to elapse before vaccination is repeated, but in the great\r\nmajority of instances safety may be attained by revaccination every\r\nfive or six years, and always in the presence of an epidemic,\r\nregardless of the lapse of time; also whenever one's mode of life is\r\nto undergo a noteworthy change, {468} as in emigrating to a foreign\r\ncountry, on entering the military service, and the like.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, vaccination almost invariably protects against\r\nsmall-pox for the time being; generally for a long term of years;\r\nsometimes for a lifetime. Often the protection is absolute; as a rule,\r\nit is very nearly so; in rare instances it is trifling. In general\r\nterms, it may be said that it is scarcely less protective than\r\nvariolous infection itself, for death from a second attack of\r\nsmall-pox is by no means rare. Here the question comes up: Is\r\nvaccination less protective, either in degree or in duration of\r\neffect, than it was at the time of its adoption? Given a typical\r\nvaccinia, we may unhesitatingly answer, No; but do we now so\r\ninvariably produce the disease in all its essential features as was\r\ndone in Jenner's time? Yes, provided we use proper virus and employ as\r\nmuch care as was taken by the older physicians, who, trained to the\r\npractice of variolation (the inoculation par excellence of bygone\r\ndays), did their work with a gusto now seldom witnessed. But there was\r\na time, now happily at an end, when it was not easy to obtain\r\nthoroughly good virus, and when, therefore, the result was apt to vary\r\nmaterially from the standard. This may be conceded without entering\r\nupon the vexed question of the general deterioration of the Jennerian\r\nstock of vaccine.\r\n\r\nBesides immunity from small-pox, there are one or two sequelæ of\r\nvaccinia that deserve mention before we proceed to consider what it is\r\nbetter to class as complications. In the first place, vaccination has\r\nbeen supposed to confer temporary protection against whooping cough.\r\nThe writer is not aware, however, of any precise data going to prove\r\neither the truth or the falsity of this supposition.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by virtue probably of the inflammation that attends the\r\nevolution of the vaccinal pock, vaccination practised in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of a small nævus often cures that blemish, and it has\r\nbeen done for that purpose in many cases. It has no advantage over\r\nmany other measures, however, and there is the disadvantage that the\r\nnævus may so mask the pock as to give rise to some doubt as to the\r\nsatisfactory character of the latter. The practice, therefore, is not\r\nto be urged.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS.--These are local and systemic. Those of them that are\r\nat all serious are rare, and can generally be traced to fortuitous\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nInflammatory complications are usually due to undue traumatism at the\r\ntime of the inoculation, to injury of the pock, or to the previous\r\nexistence of a cutaneous disease or of some dyscrasia. Dermatitis is\r\nthe most common. It is usually a mere erythema, but in some instances\r\nlymphangitis, lymphadenitis, phlegmonous inflammation, with diffuse\r\nsuppuration, may result. From injury of the pock ulceration and\r\ngangrene may take place, and septic absorption may follow in their\r\ntrain. These complications are to be treated as if they had occurred\r\nfrom any other cause. Generally, the mere vaccination is not\r\nresponsible for them, but in some instances putrescent vaccine may be\r\nadduced as their source. In such cases the complications, if they can\r\nstill be called so, are apt to make their appearance long before the\r\npock matures, even within forty-eight hours of the vaccination.\r\nInflammatory complications supervening on the full development of the\r\npock may invariably be set down as due to some cause not connected\r\nwith the quality of the virus employed.\r\n\r\n{469} An undue amount of dermatitis is best treated with some mildly\r\nastringent and anodyne application. The following liniment is\r\nexcellent for the purpose: Rx. Unguenti Stramonii oz. j; Liquoris\r\nPlumbi Subacetatis fl. drachm ss; Olei Lini fl. oz. iv.--M. fiat\r\nlinimentum. As a rule, it is best to avoid poultices applied over the\r\npock itself, for they soften the tender structures that make up its\r\ndome and render it prone to rupture, with all the consequences that\r\nmay follow its conversion into an open sore. When the latter accident\r\nhas occurred, dusting powders will ordinarily suffice to absorb the\r\ndischarge, and thus prevent putrefaction--either the ordinary toilet\r\npowder or salicylized or carbolized powders, the basis of which may be\r\nstarch with a small proportion of the oxide of zinc. Besides the\r\nantiseptics mentioned, iodoform, boric acid, etc. may be used to\r\nadvantage. Liquid applications are not usually so appropriate, but the\r\nwriter has known the proprietary preparation termed Listerine to\r\nanswer admirably.\r\n\r\nCircumscribed collections of pus are to be treated as under other\r\ncircumstances, and burrowing is to be guarded against. It is only in\r\nthe worst cases that constitutional treatment of any sort is demanded,\r\nand in these it should be of a supporting nature.\r\n\r\nPassing from the simple inflammatory complications to those of a\r\nspecific character, we will first mention erysipelas. Genuine\r\nerysipelas following vaccination is quite rare, but when it does occur\r\nit is prone to prove serious. The writer believes that it always\r\ndepends on secondary infection--_i.e._ that the vaccinal wound becomes\r\nthe nidus of an erysipelatous contagium already existing in the\r\npatient's surroundings, just as any other traumatic surface might, and\r\nthat the vaccinal virus has nothing whatever to do with it. Admitting\r\nthat improper virus is apt to give rise to dangerous inflammatory\r\ncomplications, the latter are not really erysipelatous, whatever guise\r\nthey may put on. Erysipelas following vaccination calls for no other\r\ntreatment than what is proper for traumatic erysipelas under ordinary\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the subject of vaccinal syphilis. The question of the\r\npossibility of conveying constitutional taints along with vaccinia was\r\nraised long ago, but, partly relying on certain theoretical tenets,\r\nand partly because of the rarity of well-ascertained facts to shake\r\nthe blind confidence felt in the utter harmlessness of vaccination,\r\nthe profession fought the suggestion without properly investigating\r\nit. In regard to syphilis, the broad assertion was maintained that two\r\ninfectious diseases could not affect an individual at one and the same\r\ntime: either syphilis would be communicated alone or vaccinia alone;\r\nmoreover, it was affirmed that the juices of a syphilitic person were\r\nnot capable of giving rise to the disease by inoculation unless they\r\nhappened to proceed from a syphilitic lesion. There was never\r\nsufficient basis for the former of these two doctrines, and the latter\r\nreceived a rude shock when it was shown by Pallizzari and the\r\nanonymous physician of the Palatinate that the blood of a syphilitic\r\nsubject was capable of conveying the taint. Meantime, certain horrible\r\noutbreaks of syphilis were reported, chiefly in Italy, that could not\r\nreasonably be imputed to the ordinary occasions of syphilitic\r\ninfection. Even these occurrences, however, failed to shake the\r\ngeneral incredulity, especially in Great Britain, where until quite\r\nrecently men's orthodoxy in medical matters was gauged by their\r\nobstinacy in refusing to {470} investigate, far less believe, the\r\nslightest proposition unfavorable to vaccination, and where, also,\r\nobservations from beyond the limits of the empire were looked upon as\r\nin all probability fallacious.\r\n\r\nTo a Frenchman, M. Viennois, we are indebted for the first systematic\r\nand fair-minded study of the subject of vaccinal syphilis. This writer\r\ndemonstrated that the Rivalta cases and those of other like outbreaks\r\nwere certainly due to vaccination, but he concluded that they owed\r\ntheir occurrence not necessarily to the use of lymph from syphilitic\r\nsubjects, but to the fact that that lymph contained blood. By this\r\ntime it had come to be recognized that syphilis was inoculable by the\r\nblood. But even Viennois's masterly essay, and the facilis descensus\r\nit offered to those English authors who found themselves confronted\r\nwith proof positive of their error, failed to make any noteworthy\r\nimpression beyond the concession that syphilis might possibly be\r\ncommunicable in vaccination, but that, if it were, the catastrophe\r\nmight easily be escaped by avoiding the use of lymph contaminated with\r\nblood, and that, therefore, the danger was practically no danger at\r\nall, for no one in England would think of using bloody lymph! In all\r\nthis the English were slavishly followed by our own countrymen. It is\r\nproper to add, however, that Ballard of London did his best to present\r\nthe matter in a proper light to the British profession, and that it is\r\nlargely due to his labors and to those of Jonathan Hutchinson (the\r\nlatter of whom supplemented Ricord's discovery that vaccine lymph is\r\nnever free from blood with abundant clinical evidence of the existence\r\nof vaccinal syphilis unavoidable by the mere observance of Viennois's\r\nsafeguard) that we are now freed from the clog of error in this\r\nmatter. Nor was it the English alone that so long baffled the\r\nrecognition of the truth; in the French Académie de Médicine, Jules\r\nGuérin and his adherents fought desperately against it.\r\n\r\nAt the present day we know that syphilis is liable to be communicated\r\nin vaccination, and that, too, without regard to visible blood in the\r\nlymph employed. There are two ways of avoiding it. One is, to use\r\nnon-humanized lymph, since the lower animals are insusceptible to\r\nsyphilis.[1] This is simple. The other is, to select a human\r\nvaccinifer that is free from syphilis. This is difficult. Too great\r\nreliance, however, should not be placed upon the vaccinifer; it is\r\npossible to convey syphilis even in the use of bovine virus. Suppose\r\ntwo persons, A and B, are to be vaccinated at one sitting, A being\r\nsyphilitic. If A is vaccinated first, and the same lancet, imperfectly\r\ncleansed, is used on B, it is plain that B will be inoculated not only\r\nwith vaccine lymph, but also with A's blood. It is of the first\r\nimportance, therefore, that this form of vaccinal inoculation of\r\nsyphilis should be carefully guarded against; and that can be\r\naccomplished most certainly by using a fresh instrument for each\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Practically, this is certain, although there is some\r\nreason to believe that the disease may be conveyed to monkeys.]\r\n\r\nFrom a medico-legal point of view it is important to note that\r\nconstitutional syphilis may follow vaccination, and yet have nothing\r\nto do with it. Suppose an infant to be born syphilitic, but with no\r\nvisible manifestations of the taint. Let that child be vaccinated, and\r\nlet the syphilitic dyscrasia afterward break forth. The ordinary\r\ninference would be that the syphilis was due to the vaccination; and\r\nin most instances this view would certainly be urged by the syphilitic\r\nparent, since it would {471} free him from suspicion. It is always\r\neasy to disprove such an allegation, however, for syphilis\r\ncommunicated in vaccination always shows itself first in the form of a\r\nchancre at the site of the vaccination. Therefore in any given case,\r\nunless this mode of onset can be proved, the syphilis is manifestly\r\nnot of vaccinal origin. Some observers, it is true, are of the opinion\r\nthat vaccination may evoke a pre-existing syphilis, to use Lanoix's\r\nterm--_i.e._ that it may hasten the appearance of the characteristic\r\nmanifestations, and even determine their localization at the site of\r\nthe vaccinal inoculation. But, even allowing the truth of that\r\nproposition, in such a case the lesion would be constitutional, not\r\nchancrous.\r\n\r\nIt is well, nevertheless, to take precautions against being placed on\r\nthe defensive in this way; and it may commonly be avoided by declining\r\nto vaccinate infants under three or four months old, since inherited\r\nsyphilis generally manifests itself by that time. This prudence on our\r\nown behalf should not be carried so far, however, as to lead us to\r\ndeny the benefit of vaccination to very young infants whenever the\r\nprevalence of small-pox is such that they are in obvious danger of\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nAs regards its management, vaccinal syphilis does not differ from the\r\nordinary form of the affection, and hence demands no other treatment\r\nthan what is proper for the disease contracted in the usual way. It\r\nsimply originates in an extragenital chancre.\r\n\r\nConcerning the conveyance of other constitutional taints in\r\nvaccination our knowledge is very limited. The present tendency of\r\npathological investigation is, however, to accord inoculability to\r\nmany diseases that formerly were not imagined to possess that quality,\r\nso that in regard to other affections than syphilis it is prudent to\r\nuse the utmost care in the choice of lymph. There is one supposed\r\nsafeguard that does not seem to have the slightest title to be so\r\nregarded--namely, the notion that a typical pock cannot be developed\r\non a person affected with a specific cachexia. There is no truth in\r\nthe doctrine. Over and over again the writer has seen perfect vaccine\r\npocks on persons whom he knew to be syphilitic.\r\n\r\nCutaneous affections of a non-specific character are sometimes\r\nobserved to result from vaccination; that is to say, they follow close\r\nupon its performance, without any other known exciting cause. It may\r\nfairly be supposed that in many instances they would have shown\r\nthemselves even if the vaccination had not been performed, for it is\r\noften the case that we are unable to speak positively in regard to the\r\nexciting cause of an eruption. Several years ago a striking case in\r\npoint was related to the writer by a well-known physician of this\r\ncity, S. S. Purple, in whose practice it occurred. Purple had engaged\r\nto vaccinate a child on a certain day, but for some reason the\r\nvaccination was not done. In about a week from the appointed day,\r\nhowever, erysipelas made its appearance, beginning on the left arm at\r\nthe usual site of vaccination, and pursued its course to a fatal\r\ntermination. To be sure, we are now speaking of non-specific\r\naffections, but erysipelas illustrates the proposition perfectly,\r\nnotwithstanding its specific character.\r\n\r\nChildren with a tendency to eczema are prone to suffer an outbreak of\r\nthat disease as the result of vaccination. In Jenner's time, indeed,\r\nit was considered not only that there was great risk of causing an\r\naggravation of any slight eczematous eruption by vaccination, but that\r\nthe mere {472} existence of the eczema, even in the most trivial form,\r\nwas likely to interfere with the success of the vaccinal inoculation.\r\nThis has been the general feeling of the profession. Quite recently,\r\nhowever, many observations have been recorded tending to show that the\r\nold dread of vaccinating an eczematous child was not altogether\r\nwarranted. The question needs further study, and, while it is probably\r\nbest to postpone the operation under ordinary circumstances, nothing\r\nshould induce us to withhold its protective influence where there is\r\nany manifest danger of actual exposure to small-pox.\r\n\r\nAlthough eczema is the most common of the cutaneous affections called\r\nforth or aggravated by vaccination, there are various forms of skin\r\ndisease, some of them difficult to classify, that occasionally result.\r\nThey are usually vesicular, pustular, or furuncular--that is to say,\r\nirritative. In the majority of instances it will be found either that\r\nthe pock itself has followed an irregular course, being whitish,\r\ndiffuse, and ending in an exaggerated although superficial\r\nincrustation, or that it has been subjected to injury. Still, in some\r\ncases neither of these conditions is the precursor of the skin\r\naffection. In many instances the latter can only be called\r\nnondescript. There seems to be some occult connection between\r\nvaccination and the curious skin disease described by the late Tilbury\r\nFox of London under the name of impetigo contagiosa; and, indeed,\r\nPiffard of this city has found certain microphytes to be common to the\r\ncrusting period of vaccinia and that of contagious impetigo. What the\r\nrelation of the two affections is to each other, however, it is\r\ndifficult to say.\r\n\r\nApart from impetigo contagiosa, the cutaneous complications that\r\nfollow in the wake of vaccination possess no distinctive features, and\r\ntheir management differs in no wise from that of the same\r\nmanifestations due to other causes.\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNICS OF VACCINATION.--This aspect of our theme involves a\r\nnumber of separate considerations. It will be convenient to give our\r\nattention first to the matter of the choice of virus. The question\r\narises at once as to the selection between animal vaccine and the\r\nhumanized variety. In a broad sense the term animal vaccine\r\nincludes--1. Virus derived directly from a case of so-called\r\nspontaneous cow-pox. 2. Variola vaccine--_i.e._ the virus of an\r\naffection of the cow resulting from variolation. 3. The virus of\r\nhorse-pox (not strictly vaccinal). 4. Retro-vaccine--_i.e._ the virus\r\nof an affection produced in the cow by the inoculation of vaccinia\r\nfrom the human subject. 5. The virus of a disease (true vaccinia)\r\npropagated through a series of bovine animals from the so-called\r\nspontaneous cow-pox, being the virus now commonly understood by the\r\nterm, and the variety here referred to when it is not stated to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nBy humanized vaccine we understand that which is obtained from the\r\nhuman subject, no matter how short or how long its descent from the\r\ncow. As regards animal vaccine, we may practically exclude from\r\nconsideration all but the last variety mentioned, that being the one\r\nto which, in the great majority of instances, the term is now\r\nrestricted. This narrows the question down to the choice between virus\r\nthat has been propagated through a number of bovine animals\r\n(practically, calves) from the spontaneous disease in the cow, and\r\nthat which, whatever its original source, has already passed through\r\nthe human system.\r\n\r\n{473} The variety first mentioned, sometimes called primary vaccine,\r\nis generally spoken of by authors as not very trustworthy as regards\r\nits infective power (that is, not to be counted on to take), and as\r\nprone to give rise to undue inflammatory complications when its use\r\ndoes prove successful. These unpleasant qualities might be explained\r\nby the supposition that primary vaccine is not apt to be at its best\r\nwhen it is now and then obtained. Practically, however, it may be\r\ndismissed without further consideration, for it is seldom to be had.\r\n\r\nThe second form--variola-vaccine--is manifestly improper to be used\r\nwhenever genuine vaccine is to be obtained, unless, indeed, we shut\r\nour eyes to the accumulating evidence that variola-vaccine, so called,\r\nis not vaccine at all. Furthermore, it is a question whether its use,\r\nas well as all attempts to produce it, should not be forbidden by law.\r\n\r\nThe third variety, if such it may be called, it does not seem\r\nlegitimate to use in the present state of our knowledge, since it is\r\nnot yet proved satisfactorily that horse-pox possesses the full\r\nprotective power of cow-pox, or is free from objections that do not\r\narise in connection with the latter.\r\n\r\nAs to retro-vaccine, while the writer is unable to see any positive\r\nreason against its use, neither can he see any reason why it should be\r\nsuperior to humanized vaccine, as such, save that during the period of\r\nits bovine propagation it is not liable to become contaminated with\r\nthe poison of syphilis. The idea that an enfeebled stock of humanized\r\nvaccine can have new life infused into it by passing through the\r\nsystem of the cow is not reasonable primâ facie, and there are no\r\nparticular facts to support it. By ensuring freedom from the danger of\r\ncommunicating syphilis retro-vaccination doubtless served a good\r\npurpose at one time, but now, since the remarkable and enduring\r\nexcellence of the Beaugency stock is so well established, there seems\r\nto be no excuse for a further resort to the practice.\r\n\r\nThe last of our five forms of animal vaccine, that produced by the\r\ncontinued propagation of spontaneous cow-pox through calves, is what\r\nis now known as animal vaccine par excellence. Its advantages over the\r\nother forms are so obvious that it alone should figure in any\r\ncomparison between animal and humanized vaccine. That being\r\nunderstood, what are the relative merits of animal and humanized\r\nvaccine? It should be stated, in the first place, that bovine virus\r\nshould be compared with virus that has long been humanized, for lymph\r\nof but a few removes from the bovine animal does not show any\r\nnoteworthy differences from animal vaccine itself.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of humanized virus it is maintained--1, that it is a more\r\ntrustworthy preventive of small-pox; 2, that it is superior in its\r\ninfective property, so that it is surer to take; 3, that it is more\r\nprompt in its action, thereby affording more speedy protection to\r\npersons who have actually been exposed to small-pox; 4, that its\r\nvirulent property is easier of preservation, wherefore it is more to\r\nbe depended on when it is necessary to keep it on hand for a long time\r\nor to transmit it to great distances; 5, that its use requires less\r\nskill, or, rather, less special knowledge of the peculiarities of the\r\nanimal virus; 6, that it is less violent in its effects; 7, that it is\r\nless apt to give rise to irregular, and therefore more or less\r\nabortive and non-protective, forms of pock.\r\n\r\n{474} The first of these propositions, which asserts that humanized\r\nvaccine confers greater protection against small-pox than the animal\r\nvirus, was warmly maintained by those who opposed animal vaccination\r\non its first introduction into this country; but now the record of the\r\npast thirteen years, during which period bovine virus has more and\r\nmore borne the brunt of the fight against small-pox, has disproved it\r\nin the judgment of all competent and fair-minded observers. So far,\r\nindeed, as the facts have been analyzed, they go to show that the\r\nreverse is the case--that bovine virus confers a more complete and a\r\nmore lasting protection. Direct observation on this point is\r\nstrengthened by the collateral fact that revaccination became at once\r\nastonishingly successful when the use of animal vaccine first gained\r\ncurrency, whereas now it is again declining in success; the\r\nexplanation of which latter circumstance is, that it is now found\r\ndifficult to revaccinate those whose primary vaccination was done with\r\nbovine virus--a striking indication of the permanence of the\r\nprotection accomplished with the latter.\r\n\r\nThe second assertion--that humanized virus succeeds more readily than\r\nthe bovine variety--is still maintained by many, but, it may\r\nconfidently be said, by few if any whose experience with good animal\r\nvaccine has been large. The truth is, that every large public\r\nvaccination service in the country is now carried on almost solely\r\nwith bovine virus, and that results are thus achieved that were not\r\ndreamed of in former times. Individual experience cannot weigh against\r\nthis fact, but may be explained, rather, by what modicum of truth\r\nthere may be in the fifth proposition, or by the assumption (surely a\r\nlegitimate one, in view of the number of irresponsible and ignorant\r\npurveyors of animal vaccine that have thrust themselves before the\r\nprofession since the advantages of the practice were established by\r\nthe labors of others) that those whose observation leads them to a\r\nconclusion at variance with that reached by the great majority of\r\ntrained observers have really been unfortunate in the quality of the\r\nvirus with which they have been supplied. Whatever the explanation may\r\nbe, however, there is nothing more certain than that the use of animal\r\nvaccine, properly carried out, is daily furnishing results that have\r\nnever been excelled, if they have been equalled, in the employment of\r\nhumanized virus on a like scale.\r\n\r\nThe third suggestion--that the humanized virus acts the more promptly\r\nof the two, and is therefore to be preferred for immediate\r\nprotection--is plausible, since the areola (the alleged sign of\r\nsystemic infection) forms somewhat later around a pock produced by\r\nanimal virus than around one that is the result of vaccination with\r\nthe humanized variety. The difference is one of a few hours only at\r\nthe most, and it is not by any means a general occurrence; still, we\r\nmay concede that in this respect the use of humanized virus is to be\r\npreferred under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs to the fourth statement--that humanized virus is more tenacious of\r\nits infective property--strictly speaking, there is not a particle of\r\ntruth in it. In the case of liquid lymph preserved in capillary tubes\r\nit has the semblance of truth, but, for reasons that will be more\r\nfully set forth hereafter, that is because it is difficult to get the\r\nvirulent portion of bovine lymph out of the tube. In the form of dried\r\nlymph (the only form that ought to be used) animal vaccine may be sent\r\nto all parts of the world, and may be kept any reasonable length of\r\ntime and without {475} special care, without undergoing sensible\r\ndeterioration, if tested by one who is familiar with its peculiarities\r\nand aware of the care that should be taken in using it. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances there is no difficulty about preserving animal vaccine\r\nwith its energy practically unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe statement that the use of humanized virus demands less special\r\nknowledge than that of bovine virus is conceded at once. That special\r\nknowledge is easily mastered, however, and no man fitted to practise\r\nmedicine will look upon its acquirement as a bugbear or a hardship.\r\n\r\nThe impression, almost universal thirteen years ago, that humanized\r\nvaccine is less severe in its local and constitutional effects than\r\nthe animal virus has been eradicated from the minds of all but those\r\nwho still follow the teachings of the older writers rather than yield\r\nto what daily experience has been teaching during these thirteen\r\nyears, or those who reason from exceptional cases rather than from a\r\ngeneral drift. The truth seems to be this: with revaccinated adults\r\nanimal vaccine acts somewhat more severely than the humanized virus;\r\nin infants, on the other hand, its action is not so violent as that of\r\nthe humanized variety.\r\n\r\nConcerning the seventh and last claim put forward in behalf of\r\nhumanized vaccine--that it is less apt to give rise to irregular or\r\nspurious pocks--we may say that no form of irregularity has been\r\nobserved by those who have lately used the bovine virus that was not\r\nwell known to the older writers, who founded their observations\r\nwholly, or almost wholly, on the use of the humanized virus; nor is\r\nthere any proof that such irregularities are more common now than\r\nformerly. The truth seems to be, that these irregular forms of pock\r\nseem to prevail at certain times, and not at other times, regardless\r\nof the particular stock of virus used, other things being equal. Why\r\nthis should be so we do not know, but the fact is beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, we can only say that in barely one particular--that\r\nof promptness of action--can humanized virus justly be credited with\r\nany superiority, while in every other essential respect it is\r\ninferior, so far as any difference is to be observed.\r\n\r\nWhat, on the other hand, are the points of superior excellence\r\nattaching to bovine virus? Setting aside certain extravagant\r\nassertions that have sometimes been made in its behalf, such as that\r\nit far exceeds the humanized virus in its protective virtue (which may\r\nbe true, but is not yet proved), they may be put in general terms in\r\nthe form of a denial of all the particular claims that we have\r\nenumerated as having been put forth for its rival. Such a denial, it\r\nhas been seen, seems to the writer to be justified, save in the one\r\nparticular that perhaps we should accord to humanized virus the merit\r\nof speedier action, and consequently greater certainty of protection,\r\nin cases of actual exposure to small-pox.\r\n\r\nBesides these negative points in its favor, the foremost advantage of\r\nanimal vaccine is the guarantee it gives that, properly used, no\r\nsyphilitic contamination will result. On this point no argument is\r\nneeded, for the cow is insusceptible to syphilis.\r\n\r\nA second consideration in its favor is, that it can always be had in\r\nlarge quantities at short notice. The young practitioner of the\r\npresent day can scarcely appreciate the importance of this fact, but\r\nwhoever remembers the comparative helplessness in which, in past\r\nyears, he has found himself in the face of a sudden outbreak of\r\nsmall-pox, not knowing which {476} way to turn for an adequate supply\r\nof vaccine, will at once concede its force.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it must be said that bovine virus is entitled to\r\nthe preference as a rule, but that possibly it is well to resort to\r\nhumanized lymph of early removes under the special circumstances above\r\nreferred to. On no account should long-humanized vaccine be used so\r\nlong as our present stocks of animal virus maintain the excellence\r\nthey have thus far preserved, nor should humanized virus of any sort\r\nbe preferred in the general run of cases.\r\n\r\nPassing now to a consideration of the various forms of vaccine,\r\ndisregarding its source, there are practically these three: the crust,\r\nliquid lymph preserved in capillary tubes, and dried lymph.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the crust, or scab, was much used in this country. Its\r\ncapability of being preserved unimpaired for a long time was a valid\r\nexcuse for this, especially in regions remote from the great channels\r\nof communication, and it was in such districts that the use of the\r\ncrust was chiefly practised. That excuse scarcely exists now, for\r\nthere are few physicians who cannot obtain a better form of vaccine\r\nwithin a very short time. The objections to the crust are two: 1. Most\r\ncrusts are inert. Especially is this true of bovine crusts, which are\r\nwellnigh worthless. It must be confessed, however, that when once a\r\ncrust has proved itself active it may be trusted to retain its\r\ninfective property for a very long time. The writer has made\r\nsuccessful use of crusts seven years old that had made the voyage to\r\nJapan and back; and they were bovine crusts too. Still, the rule is,\r\nthat crusts are untrustworthy. 2. Their use is apt to be followed by\r\nundue inflammation, probably of septic origin, for they almost\r\ninvariably contain putrescent or readily putrescible elements. It has\r\neven happened to the writer to cut open a crust that to all appearance\r\nwas typical and innocent, and to find in its interior a cavity\r\noccupied by a pulpy, stinking slough. Manifestly, such material is\r\nunfit to be introduced into the system of any human being.\r\n\r\nIn regard to liquid lymph in tubes, it is not much used in this\r\ncountry, and its employment elsewhere is on the decline. At first\r\nthought, it would seem to be the best form of all, but experience does\r\nnot bear out this view. In this form humanized lymph is vastly\r\nsuperior to animal lymph, but with every possible care in charging and\r\nsealing the tubes it is not uncommon to find their contents putrid.\r\nThere are low vegetable organisms that are supposed to prey on the\r\nvaccinad. If there is any truth in this supposition, those organisms\r\nare certainly favored in their destructive luxuriance by keeping the\r\nlymph liquid, thus furnishing them with the best possible\r\nculture-fluid. Be this as it may, the fact is well ascertained that\r\ntube-lymph does not keep well. It has been mentioned already that\r\nbovine lymph stored in tubes is decidedly inferior to the same form of\r\nhumanized lymph. This was long ago recognized by propagators of animal\r\nvaccine, but the cause remained a mystery until Warlomont of Brussels\r\nsuggested that it was due to one of the physical peculiarities of\r\nanimal lymph--that, namely, as already hinted at, by virtue of which\r\nits formed elements tend to attach themselves to any surface presented\r\nto them, leaving the supernatant liquid a mere inert compound of\r\nwater, albumen, and salts; so that in the case of tube-lymph the\r\nvirulent elements remain attached to the glass, and only the inert\r\nconstituents {477} are really used. This theory is exceedingly\r\ningenious and plausible, but the writer is not aware that it has been\r\nproved. He does know, however, that in some South American countries,\r\nwhere calf lymph in tubes is used with success, the custom is to grind\r\nthe tubes to powder, and inoculate with the resulting magma, glass and\r\nall. This practice is certainly not to be commended.\r\n\r\nDried lymph is the most efficient of all forms of vaccine, and, kept\r\nas it ought to be, it retains its infective power long enough to\r\nanswer all ordinary requirements. The writer has used it three years\r\nold with success. It may commonly be counted on for six weeks. One\r\nfact should be borne in mind, however: the longer dried lymph has been\r\nkept the more care is necessary in its use, for by long keeping it\r\nbecomes very hard, so that it is a work of patience to dissolve it off\r\nfrom the surface on which it was deposited. Failure to accomplish its\r\nsolution is the most common cause of a lack of success in its\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe various forms of stored vaccine are esteemed by the writer in the\r\nfollowing order: 1, dried bovine lymph; 2, dried humanized lymph; 3,\r\nhumanized tube-lymph; 4, humanized crusts; 5, bovine tube-lymph; 6,\r\nbovine crusts.\r\n\r\nThe age and other circumstances under which it is best to vaccinate\r\nchildren constitute a point for practical consideration. It may first\r\nbe mentioned that pre-natal vaccination has been advocated by some\r\nauthors; that is to say, the vaccinal infection of the foetus in utero\r\nby vaccinating the mother during gestation. There seems to be\r\nrespectable testimony going to show that the end may thus be\r\naccomplished, but a weighty objection arises in the fact that this\r\nmediate vaccination of the foetus produces no physical sign of its\r\nsuccess, so that doubt must always be felt as to whether or not the\r\nprocedure has been efficacious. Moreover, it is seldom indeed that a\r\nchild needs protection before its birth, provided we protect the\r\nmother, for it is well known that vaccinia will overtake and destroy\r\nthe variolous infection, even when the latter has had two or three\r\ndays' start. The practice has been chiefly urged by Bollinger. It is\r\nnot likely to come into general use.\r\n\r\nThere is no special objection to vaccinating an infant at any time\r\nafter birth, but usually it is well to defer the operation until the\r\nchild is about three months old, unless there is actual danger of\r\nexposure to small-pox. Yet it is not well to postpone vaccination\r\nuntil the period of dentition, for the combined irritation of the two\r\ndisturbing elements may prove decidedly uncomfortable if not serious.\r\n\r\nSomething is to be said as to the time of the year to be chosen. In\r\nNew York the bad custom prevails, especially among the poorer classes,\r\nof having children vaccinated only in April, May, or June--just the\r\npart of the year in which erysipelas is most rife. The hot months\r\nshould not generally be chosen, for any source of irritation is apt to\r\nbe felt more severely by infants during the summer heat. However, no\r\ncircumstances should be looked upon as a positive bar to vaccination\r\nin case of actual danger of exposure to small-pox, and in large towns\r\nchildren should never be taken into public conveyances or carried into\r\nany promiscuous assemblage until they have been protected by\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nThe next question is as to the part of the body that should be\r\nselected for the inoculation. The region of the insertion of the left\r\ndeltoid muscle {478} is usually chosen--the left rather than the\r\nright, because most nurses habitually carry an infant on their own\r\nleft arm, so that the child's left arm is uppermost, and hence less\r\nexposed to injury. The region of the deltoid insertion is\r\ncomparatively free from the irritation of muscular contraction, and it\r\nis easily accessible. If two insertions are made, it is well to make\r\none of them over the deltoid insertion and the other at a point about\r\nan inch distant on the line of the posterior border of the same\r\nmuscle, for there the lymphatic connection with the axillary glands is\r\nless free, so that adenitis is not so much to be feared. To avoid a\r\nscar in a locality that may be exposed to view on certain occasions\r\nsome mothers prefer that their daughters should be vaccinated on the\r\nlower limb. To this there is no special objection, further than that\r\nthe lower limb is rather more exposed to rough handling than the arm.\r\nIf the leg is chosen, the point of junction of the two heads of the\r\ngastrocnemius is an eligible situation.\r\n\r\nThe actual operation is performed in various ways. The old inoculators\r\ngenerally made an incision through the whole thickness of the skin, so\r\nthat a pellet of subcutaneous fat rolled up into the little wound.\r\nThis is wholly unnecessary; furthermore, it is objectionable, for it\r\ndecidedly increases the risk of inflammatory complications. Still more\r\nto be avoided are the methods by inserting a seton imbued with the\r\nvirus and by hypodermic injection or other like procedures. The best\r\nway is, simply to remove the horny layer of the cuticle, so as to\r\nexpose the succulent portion of the epidermis. This surface is\r\nsomewhat red, and from it a slight exudation of lymph will be\r\nobserved, but there need not be the least flow of blood. By this\r\nprocedure it is not uncommon to vaccinate a sleeping child without\r\nwaking it. It is not only admissible, but preferable, not to wound the\r\nderma at all. Such an abrasion is easily made with an ordinary lancet,\r\nwhich, contrary to the advice sometimes given, should be very sharp;\r\nbut no cutting or scratching should be done with it, only scraping\r\nwith the convex part of its edge, precisely as in using an ink-eraser.\r\nScratching instruments (such as the rake-like vaccinator often used or\r\na row of needles set in a handle) are not easy to adapt to varying\r\ndegrees of plumpness of the arm, and are apt to make too deep\r\nscratches, one at either side, while the skin between the two is\r\nscarcely touched. Whatever instrument is chosen, it should not be used\r\nagain until it has been thoroughly cleansed--made chemically\r\nclean--which can be accomplished only by heating it or by wiping it\r\noff and then dipping it into a strong disinfectant solution.\r\n\r\nSome individuals are refractory to vaccination, but complete\r\ninsusceptibility is exceedingly rare. Various expedients have been\r\nresorted to in rebellious cases, such as vesication with\r\nammonia-water, maceration of the skin for some hours with glycerine,\r\nand the like. The writer has known these devices to succeed, but he\r\nhas not seen the slightest advantage in the plan recommended by Ceely,\r\nthat of using a wound some hours old rather than one just made,\r\nalthough he has tried the experiment many times. It is not necessary\r\nto make a large abrasion; one as large as the little finger-nail is\r\nample.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to apply the virus, and it should be so applied as to\r\nbring it into contact with every part of the denuded surface. In what\r\nis known as arm-to-arm vaccination, or its equivalent, calf-to-arm\r\n{479} vaccination (by all means the most successful method, although\r\nnot often practicable in this country), the liquid lymph, fresh from\r\nthe vaccinifer's pock, is simply applied, when it will at once become\r\ndiffused over the abraded surface without any special pains being\r\ntaken to accomplish that end.\r\n\r\nIf dried lymph is used, particular care should be taken to see that it\r\nis actually dissolved and transferred from the substance on which it\r\nwas dried to the abraded surface. Failure to accomplish this is the\r\ncause of almost all the lack of success that inexperienced vaccinators\r\nmeet with. The lymph should be moistened with water, or, if it is\r\nquite old, with glycerine, before the abrasion is made, so that it may\r\nhave time to dissolve. It should then be rubbed upon the abraded spot\r\nvigorously, and at least for the space of a full minute.\r\n\r\nIn the use of tube-lymph no other precautions are necessary than in\r\narm-to-arm vaccination, but, simple as this method is, its results are\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nCrusts should be reduced to a powder, and then made into a thin paste\r\nwith water or glycerine. A convenient way of powdering a crust is to\r\nrub it on a file or between two files. The paste is to be well rubbed\r\nupon the abrasion. The insertion of a solid piece of crust into a\r\nvalvular incision is not to be recommended.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation is finished it is well to keep the arm bare for\r\nabout five minutes, but not necessarily until the spot has become dry.\r\nIt is not well to apply any sort of plaster, but means should be taken\r\nto prevent the underclothing from sticking to the abrasion. For this\r\npurpose there is no objection to the shields that are furnished by the\r\nsurgical instrument-makers. Usually, however, nothing of the sort is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nTHE STORAGE AND PRESERVATION OF VACCINE VIRUS.--Lymph should usually\r\nbe taken on the eighth day, inclusive--never after the areola has\r\nformed. On the other hand, the writer's experience does not lead him\r\nto coincide with those who state that the earliest lymph that can be\r\nobtained is the most energetic. If it is to be dry-stored, the\r\nsubstance to be coated with it (slips of quill, ivory, wood,\r\nwhalebone, glass, and the like) should be laid gently in the pool of\r\nlymph that exudes on puncturing the pock, and allowed to dry,\r\npreferably without the aid of artificial warmth. The layer of lymph\r\nshould be plainly visible after it has dried. A second coating is\r\nadvisable, as it serves to preserve the first.\r\n\r\nCapillary glass tubes are either cylindrical or furnished with a\r\nbulbous expansion at the middle, the latter form being most commonly\r\nused. To charge a tube make sure that both ends are open, and then\r\nsubmerge one end in the pool of lymph. Capillary attraction will cause\r\nthe tube to fill, and the process may be facilitated materially by\r\ninclining the tube toward a horizontal direction, so that the\r\ncapillary attraction is not opposed by that of gravitation. Care\r\nshould be taken to keep the applied end of the tube constantly\r\nsubmerged, or bubbles of air will enter it. The sealing may be done\r\nwith a blowpipe, by simply holding the ends in a flame, or by means of\r\nsealing-wax or some similar substance. The satisfactory charging of\r\ntubes demands some practice, but a little patience will enable any\r\nintelligent person to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to crusts, they should never be removed until the surface\r\nbeneath has become cicatrized and they have been partially detached by\r\nthe natural process. A crust torn off prematurely should never be\r\nused, {480} and the same may be said of secondary crusts--_i.e._ those\r\nthat form by the desiccation of the discharge from the raw surface\r\nleft when the primary crust has been removed forcibly.\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of vaccine in these various forms tubes need only\r\nbe kept in a cool place. Dried lymph and crusts should be guarded\r\nagainst dampness even more than against warmth. Their preservation may\r\nbe decidedly favored by over-drying, either in an exhausted receiver\r\nor by keeping them in a closed vessel in the presence of sulphuric\r\nacid, chloride of calcium, or some other substance having a strong\r\naffinity for water. It is needless to say, however, that they should\r\nnot come into actual contact with any such agent. While this\r\nartificial desiccation tends powerfully to preserve dried lymph, it\r\nmakes it more difficult to use. When dried lymph or a crust is to be\r\nsent by mail or other conveyance, it should be wrapped in some\r\nimpermeably envelope, for which purpose gutta-percha tissue is very\r\nconvenient. Both these forms of virus should be kept in a cool place.\r\nThere is no objection to keeping them on ice, provided they are well\r\nprotected against moisture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the writer wishes to say that the limited space at his\r\ncommand has compelled the assumption of a dogmatic rather than an\r\ninductive form in the construction of this article.

In the latter\r\npart of the seventeenth and the early part of the eighteenth century\r\nthe distinction between typical forms of the two disorders became\r\napparent, and was described by Willan and Harvey in England, and other\r\nwriters in Germany, France, Holland, and Belgium. Among those who have\r\ncontributed to its literature may be named Hebra, Kaposi, Trousseau,\r\nSimon, Thomas, Güntz, Henoch, Kassowitz, and Boeck.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Varicella is essentially a disease of early life, occurring\r\nalmost exclusively in infants and young children. It is a contagious\r\ndisorder, and at times, especially in hospitals and asylums for\r\nchildren, occurs in apparently epidemic forms. The question relating\r\nto the inoculability of the contents of its vesicular lesions is still\r\nopen, positive and negative results being recorded by different\r\nexperiments.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The writer has purposely avoided, in the brief space here\r\ndevoted to the disease under consideration, entering into a discussion\r\nof the question respecting the relation sustained by varicella to\r\nvariola. On one side are the views entertained by the Vienna school of\r\ndermatologists, according to which there is but a single virus in\r\nthese several forms of disease--the variolous poison. On the other are\r\nthe opinions and the practice, largely based upon the latter, of most\r\nEnglish and American physicians, who deny the existence of any\r\nrelation between the pathological states recognized by them as\r\noccurring in two entirely distinct affections.\r\n\r\nMy personal view may be briefly formulated as follows: Practically and\r\nclinically, it is useful to regard these disorders as of a distinct\r\nnature. The arguments, however, in favor of such absolute distinction\r\nare not irrefutable. There is probably in both forms of disease but a\r\nsingle virus, that of variola; but this, modified by evolution among\r\ngenerations of vaccinated children, has, in this process of natural\r\ncultivation or attenuation, produced a malady of tender years whose\r\nattacks do not protect from variola and occur irrespective of\r\nvaccination.]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The period of incubation of the disease cannot be\r\nsaid to be definitely established. At times, without question, an\r\nentire fortnight elapses between the dates of exposure and the\r\nevolution of the disease, but both longer and shorter intervals have\r\nbeen recorded.\r\n\r\n{482} If there be a prodromal stage of the disease, certainly in the\r\nvast majority of the little patients it cannot be recognized. During\r\nthe last month the writer has observed the evolution of the disease in\r\ntwenty children gathered together in the Chicago Home for the\r\nFriendless, no one of whom was recognized as ailing before the\r\neruption appeared. Occasionally the disease is preceded by mild or\r\neven severe febrile symptoms, accidents sufficiently common in this\r\nclass of patients.\r\n\r\nThe exanthem, commonly the first symptom of the disorder, occurs in\r\nthe form of reddish puncta, from which rapidly develop rosy-colored\r\nmaculations, and these become tensely distended, transparent or\r\nslightly yellowish vesicles, of the average size of a split pea,\r\nthough they are occasionally smaller or may enlarge to the dimensions\r\nof a bean or small nut. The eruption appears first upon the upper\r\nsegment of the body, implicating the chest in front and behind, the\r\nneck, the scalp, particularly the extremities, and quite sparingly the\r\nface also, which may, however, entirely escape. In cases where the\r\neruption is profuse it may be completely generalized, involving\r\nlargely the trunk and extremities, the lesions, upon the back\r\nparticularly, being as closely set together as in discrete variola. In\r\nmany, even the majority, of cases the exanthem is much less profusely\r\ndeveloped, not more than a dozen or twenty vesicles springing from the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe vesicles are superficial in situation, the firm papule which\r\nprecedes the variolous rash being altogether wanting. They are at\r\nfirst transparent, their contents plainly showing through their\r\ntranslucent roof-wall, composed only of the stratum corneum of the\r\nepidermis. They are both acuminate and globular, and occasionally rest\r\nupon a slightly hyperæmic integument. Umbilication rapidly occurs at\r\nthe apex, and simultaneously their contents become lactescent and\r\ngradually sero-purulent. Occasionally vesicles are transformed into\r\ngenuine, coffee-bean-sized, pustules. Intermingled with these are\r\noften seen illy-developed and abortive vesicles.\r\n\r\nBy the end of a period lasting from twelve hours to the second or\r\nthird day involution has usually begun, and the lesions, with and\r\nwithout rupture--more often the latter--desiccate, and are thus\r\ntransformed into yellowish or yellowish and brown, circular,\r\ncircumscribed crusts resting upon an apparently unaltered integument.\r\nThese crusts are often so firmly attached that they do not fall\r\nspontaneously before the lapse of from five to eight days. When this\r\nexfoliation is ended there are left slightly hyperæmic pigmented\r\npatches of corresponding size where the crusts had rested. A\r\ndestructive process occasionally results upon the surface of the face\r\nat the base of such vesiculo-pustular lesions as have formed there, in\r\nconsequence of which a small depressed and superficial cicatrix is\r\nleft, which does not differ from that resulting from discrete variola.\r\nThese scars may be superficially seated and transitory in character,\r\nor much deeper and persistent through life.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the disease systemic symptoms may be\r\naltogether wanting, or may occur in a mild, and much more rarely in a\r\nsevere, type. In some cases the temperature is increased by one or two\r\ndegrees upon the appearance of the exanthem, and often a febrile\r\nmovement of moderate grade may persist for forty-eight hours or\r\nsomewhat longer. Defervescence, however, is always rapid and perfect.\r\nIn very {483} rare cases there is a subsequent successive new\r\ndevelopment of scanty vesicles, whose appearance is heralded by mild\r\nexacerbations of fever.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the vesicles may be recognized upon the mucous surfaces\r\nof the lips, inside of the cheeks, tongue, palate, conjunctivæ, and\r\nprogenital regions of both sexes. Still more rarely the glands of the\r\nthroat become slightly tumid and painful.\r\n\r\nThe complexus of symptoms, in the large majority of all these little\r\npatients, is that which pertains to a disorder of distinctly mild\r\ntype. The eruptive lesions are scanty and productive of but trifling\r\nsubjective sensations. Occasionally they are picked or scratched, and\r\nthus become the seat of either pain or pruritus. In the febrile stage\r\nthe child is noticeably fretful for a period of perhaps twenty-four\r\nhours. At the end of that time older children are frequently observed\r\nengaged in their customary amusements in the nursery.\r\n\r\nSevere types and complications of varicella are in general limited to\r\nthe little patients who are recognized as suffering from hospitalism.\r\nAmong these we see erysipelas, severe vaccinal eruptions, lesions of\r\ninherited syphilis, and the sequelæ of morebilli and scarlatina, which\r\nthe disease both precedes and follows.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY.--The anatomical structure of the lesions in varicella is\r\nlargely a matter of inference, since there has been but small\r\nopportunity of studying the disorder as displayed in sections of the\r\nmorbid integument. Manifestly, the exanthem is exudative in type, the\r\nserum in circumscribed areas lifting the superficial layer of the\r\nepidermis from the deeper parts of the derm. Unquestionably, septa\r\noccur in typically developed varicella chambers, similar to those seen\r\nin variola--a pathological fact which is the corner-stone of the\r\ndoctrine relating to the unity of the two disorders. The serum\r\ncontained in these septa possesses an alkaline reaction. The formation\r\nof a cicatrix is evidently due to the intensity of the process in\r\ncertain exceptional lesions, as a result of which the papillæ of the\r\ncorium are superficially destroyed. These sequelæ are often due to the\r\npicking and scratching of the lesions.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--Varicella is to be distinguished from eczema pustulosum by\r\nits mild febrile symptoms, the discreteness of its pustular lesions,\r\nthe absence of itching, and of infiltration of the skin in patches,\r\nand its tendency to symmetrical development.\r\n\r\nFrom impetigo and the impetigo contagiosa of Fox of London it will\r\noften be scarcely differentiated. Inasmuch as these disorders are\r\nfrequently recognized among children suffering from varicella or\r\nvaricella convalescence, it can scarcely be doubted that these\r\ndiseases have been in the past often confounded, and that in many\r\ncases it is practically impossible to distinguish between them.\r\nDecided elevation of bodily temperature, umbilication of\r\nsymmetrically-disposed lesions, and a rapid involution of the disease\r\npoint to varicella. The two forms of impetigo occur without fever, are\r\nusually scantily developed, and are much more apt to be pustular in\r\ntype, lacking, moreover, the halo of the varicella lesions. The latter\r\nare also, on an average, smaller and more numerous. The two forms of\r\nimpetigo, finally, never display the generalized eruption of severe\r\nvaricella. The non-contagious variety of impetigo is much more\r\ndecidedly pustular in its lesions, and the latter spring from a deeper\r\nplane of the epidermis.\r\n\r\n{484} As to the eruptions due to vaccinia and vaccination, there can\r\nbe but little doubt that these also have been frequently confounded\r\nwith varicella. Efflorescences having origin in this way are very\r\nlargely impetiginous in type, and the conditions named above are then\r\nto be regarded as distinctive differences, so far as any distinction\r\ncan, under these circumstances, be recognized. Impetigo, impetigo\r\ncontagiosa, and varicella are all sufficiently common accidents after\r\nvaccination. No reliance can be placed upon characteristics described\r\nas connected with a certain stuck-on appearance of the crust regarded\r\nby Fox as characteristic of the crusts in impetigo contagiosa. In all\r\nthese vesiculo-pustular disorders of childhood desiccating serum and\r\nsero-pus upon the surface result in the formation of crusts which have\r\na similar (so-called) stuck-on appearance.\r\n\r\nVariola and varioloid of infants and children are to be distinguished\r\nfrom varicella by the evidence of origin from such contagious\r\nmaladies; by the occurrence of prodromal symptoms; by the greater rise\r\nin temperature during the febrile stage; by the typically papular\r\nstage of the exanthem at its outset, and no less typically pustular\r\nstage before the occurrence of desiccation; by the confluence of\r\nlesions in confluent cases; and by the much longer and evidently\r\ngraver stadium of the disease. Distinctions between mild varioloid and\r\nsevere varicella in infancy and childhood will always tax to the\r\nutmost the skill of the diagnostician. The sooner it is generally\r\nunderstood that intermediate forms occur which cannot be positively\r\nassigned to the one or to the other category, the better it will be\r\nfor both the profession and the laity. The fact that in the one case\r\nthere is generation of a variolous poison capable of producing a\r\ncontagious disease in adults, and in the other a malady which is known\r\nto affect children only, renders the decision important. Scattered\r\npapulo-vesicular and vesiculo-pustular lesions appearing after a high\r\nfever, and pursuing a period of evolution longer than forty-eight\r\nhours, should always awaken suspicion. Superficial lesions, on the\r\ncontrary, distinctly vesicular on the third day, or commingled with\r\nminute, very superficial pustules, should be regarded as\r\ncharacteristic of varicella.\r\n\r\nThe so-called varicella prurigo of Hutchison of London[2] includes\r\nseveral of the disorders considered above under the titles impetigo,\r\nimpetigo contagiosa, and the vaccine rashes. The irritable condition\r\nof the skin resulting from several of the exanthemata leaves it prone\r\nto the development of a long list of cutaneous lesions, some of them\r\naccompanied by pruritus in various grades, to each of which might be\r\ngiven, according to the caprice of authors, a separate name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Lect. on Clin. Surg._, Lond., 1878, p. 15 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of varicella, per se, is always favorable.\r\nOnly in the hospital cases, complicated by erysipelas and scarlatina\r\nconvalescence, may grave results be anticipated. The milder attacks\r\nmay leave persistent relics of their career in the form of one or more\r\ndepressed and persistent cicatrices, which become less conspicuous as\r\nthe patient approaches adult years.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Varicella is, in a large proportion of cases, successfully\r\ntreated by domestic management and the simpler remedies familiar to\r\nthose in charge of the nursery. Confinement for a brief time to the\r\n{485} cradle or bed, and a proper regulation of the temperature of the\r\nroom and of the diet, are usually all that is required. Special\r\nremedies may be indicated in isolated cases, but certainly none such\r\nare demanded by the varicella. Efforts should be made to protect the\r\nface lesions from the traumatism of picking and scratching, with a\r\nview to prevent pitting.\r\n\r\nIsolation of patients is not requisite, nor any process of\r\ndisinfection other than that which is incidental to a fresh supply of\r\npure air. Vaccination should be practised alike in the case of\r\nchildren who have and who have not suffered from the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{486}\r\n\r\nSCARLET FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY J. LEWIS SMITH, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--The terms scarlet fever and scarlatina are used synonymously\r\nto designate one of the most common and fatal of the eruptive fevers.\r\nWhether this malady occurred prior to the Christian era is uncertain.\r\nIt is believed by some that the plague of Athens, 430 years before\r\nChrist, vividly described by Lucretius, and by Thucydides, who was\r\nattacked by it, was scarlet fever of a peculiarly malignant type\r\n(Richardson); but, as will be seen from the following extracts from\r\nThucydides, the plague differed in important particulars from\r\nscarlatina of the present time: \"Internally, the throat and the tongue\r\nwere quickly suffused with blood, and the breath became unnatural and\r\nfetid. There followed sneezing and hoarseness; in a short time the\r\ndisorder, accompanied by a violent cough, reached the chest.... The\r\nbody externally was not so very hot to the touch, nor yet pale: it was\r\nof a livid color, inclining to red, and breaking out in pustules and\r\nulcers.\" Loss of sight and gangrene of the extremities were common\r\nresults in those who recovered, and adults appear to have been\r\naffected as frequently as children. \"The dead lay as they had died,\r\none upon another, while others, hardly alive, wallowed in the streets\r\nand crawled about every fountain craving for water. The temples in\r\nwhich they lodged were full of the corpses of those who died in them.\"\r\nLucretius says of this plague, \"If any one for a time escaped death\r\n(as was possible, either by reason of the foul ulcers breaking or by\r\nmeans of a black discharge from the intestines), yet consumption and\r\ndestruction awaited him at last; or, as was often the case, an\r\nexcessive flux of corrupt blood, attended with violent pains in the\r\nhead, issued from the obstructed nostrils, and by this outlet the\r\nwhole strength and substance of the man passed away. He, moreover, who\r\nhad escaped this violent flux of foul blood was not certain wholly to\r\nrecover, for still the disease was ready to pass into his nerves and\r\njoints, and into the very genital organs of the body. And of those who\r\nsuffered thus, some, fearing the gates of death, continued to live,\r\nthough deprived by the steel of the virile part, and some, though\r\nwithout hands and feet, and though they lost their eyes, yet persisted\r\nto remain in life, so strong a dread of death had taken possession of\r\nthem. Upon some, too, came forgetfulness of all things, so that they\r\nknew not even themselves.\"\r\n\r\nGangrene of the extremities, loss of sight, a violent cough, loss of\r\nmemory, etc. are not symptoms of scarlet fever, so that in my opinion\r\n{487} the plague of Athens, if correctly described by the historian,\r\nwas a different malady.\r\n\r\nCaspar Morris, in his essay on scarlet fever, states his belief that\r\nSeneca, who lived in the first century of the Christian era, described\r\nan epidemic of the malignant form of scarlatina in his portrayal of\r\nthe pestilence that visited Thebes during the half-mythical age of\r\nOedipus, six centuries before Christ. Seneca's description of the\r\nsymptoms of this plague is as follows:\r\n\r\n                 Piger ignavos\r\n  Alligat artus languor, et ægro\r\n  Rubor in vultu, maculæque caput\r\n  Sparsere leves; tum vapor ipsam\r\n  Corporis arcem flammeus urit\r\n  Multoque genus sanguine tendit\r\n  Oculique regent, et sacer ignis\r\n  Pascitur artus. Resonant aures,\r\n  Stillatque niger naris aducæ\r\n  Cruor; at venas rumpit hiantes.\r\n\r\nLanguor, redness of the face, light spots upon the head, distension of\r\nthe cheeks with blood, distortion of the eyes, a flushed appearance of\r\nthe limbs, tinnitus aurium, and a discharge of black blood from the\r\nnostrils, certainly indicated a very malignant form of disease, but to\r\nbelieve that it was identical with the scarlet fever of the present\r\ntime requires considerable credulity. From the fact that it devastated\r\nThebes we infer that it occurred largely among adults, differing,\r\ntherefore, from the modern scarlet fever, whose victims are chiefly\r\nchildren. The same uncertainty hangs over epidemics during the first\r\ncenturies of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe first clear and undoubted portrayal of scarlet fever is found in\r\nthe medical literature of the sixteenth century. Sydenham and his\r\ncontemporaries in the seventeenth century witnessed epidemics of it,\r\nstudied its nature more thoroughly, and consequently acquired a more\r\naccurate knowledge of it than that possessed by their predecessors. It\r\nwas in this century that measles and scarlet fever were\r\ndifferentiated. During the last two hundred years scarlatina has been\r\nthe subject of monographs too numerous to mention. It has long been\r\nregarded as one of the most important maladies of childhood, on\r\naccount of its frequency and the great mortality that attends it, so\r\nthat numerous cases and many epidemics are every year related in the\r\nmedical journals. By this vast accumulation of observations and the\r\npatient and thorough use of the microscope our knowledge of scarlet\r\nfever has become full and accurate.\r\n\r\nAs with most of the infectious maladies, scarlet fever extended to the\r\nWestern World through European shipping. It was brought to North\r\nAmerica about the year 1735. Tardily it spread to South America, where\r\nit appeared in 1829, and more recently it has been established in\r\nAustralia. It entered Iceland in 1827, and Greenland in 1847.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The evidence is strong that scarlet fever does not\r\noriginate de novo--that it does not spring from certain atmospheric or\r\ntelluric conditions, but is produced by a definite specific principle,\r\nsince countries have been free from it for centuries till it was\r\nimported by commerce. That it appears in certain localities without\r\nany known exposure is attributed to the fact that the poison is so\r\nsubtle and transmissible that it is {488} conveyed long distances in\r\narticles of merchandise, even in small packages, so that those who\r\nchance to open them or come in contact with them are infected. It is\r\nbelieved that reading matter transmitted through the mails has in many\r\ninstances been the medium of infection.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the acute infectious maladies are caused by\r\nmicro-organisms, or, as they are now designated, microbes, commonly\r\ndiscarded at first and believed to be chimerical, is rapidly gaining\r\nground in the profession, and appears to be fully established as\r\nregards certain of them. These parasites, barely visible under high\r\npowers of the microscope, and ascertained to be vegetable by their\r\nbehavior under certain chemical agents, exist in immense numbers in\r\nthe blood, tissues, and secretions of patients suffering from the\r\ninfectious maladies, especially in the graver cases of them; and the\r\nmicroscope shows that these organisms vary in shape and appearance so\r\nas to admit of classification.\r\n\r\nThe germ theory has now become so important that it cannot be ignored\r\nin a monograph relating to so important an infectious malady as\r\nscarlet fever. The relation of microbes to the infectious diseases has\r\nbeen made the subject of investigation by Pasteur, Toussaint, and\r\nothers in France, and by many in Germany, with most interesting\r\nresults. The belief held by many, and which seemed very plausible, was\r\nthat the microbes, instead of sustaining a causative relation to the\r\nmaladies in which they occur, were the result of these maladies--that\r\nthey sprang into existence in consequence of the vitiated state of the\r\nblood and tissues, just as fungi appear on decaying substances or as\r\nthe Oidium albicans appears in certain morbid conditions of the buccal\r\nsurface and secretions. Obviously, in order to elucidate this matter\r\nand determine the relation of these parasites to the diseases in which\r\nthey occur, it was necessary to experiment on animals, but,\r\nunfortunately, as a bar to successful experimentation many of the most\r\nimportant infectious maladies which afflict the human race, as typhus\r\nand typhoid fevers, the marsh fevers, and syphilis, do not occur in\r\nanimals, or they occur in a changed and mitigated form. Others,\r\nhowever, can be produced in their typical character in animals, as\r\ndiphtheria, and others still originate in animals and are transmitted\r\nfrom them to man, as anthrax or splenic fever of the herbivora and\r\nhydrophobia. Very interesting and important results have been produced\r\nby experimental researches with the microbes of certain of these\r\ndiseases, which, if applicable to the common and fatal infectious\r\nmaladies of an analogous nature in man, may yet result in immense\r\nbenefit in mitigating the virulence of those affections which are the\r\nscourge of childhood and which sensibly diminish the increase of\r\npopulation. It has been found possible to cultivate the microbes\r\ncontained in the blood, tissues, and secretions in certain of the\r\ninfectious diseases, and after a series of cultivations, so that these\r\norganisms are far removed from the animal substance which contained\r\nthem, and with which they were so intimately associated in the\r\nindividual, they have been employed for inoculation--with this\r\nimportant result, that the primary disease was reproduced. This seems\r\nto indicate beyond question the causative relation of these parasites\r\nto the diseases in which they occur. Experiments with the result which\r\nI have stated have been made with the microbes of splenic fever,\r\nchicken cholera, murrain, and certain other maladies.\r\n\r\nPasteur employs as the media for cultivation--(1st) urine neutralized\r\n{489} by a few drops of potash solution; (2d) a liquid prepared by\r\nboiling for twenty or thirty minutes the yeast of beer in water,\r\nneutralizing, and filtering; and (3d) chicken tea, prepared by boiling\r\nequal parts of water and the lean of muscles a quarter of an hour,\r\nfiltering, and neutralizing. A small drop of infected blood is placed\r\nin the liquid of cultivation, and the microbes which it contains\r\nmultiply so abundantly that the liquid becomes turbid in a short time,\r\nand they are found in all parts of it. A drop of this liquid is added\r\nto another portion of the medium, and this also soon becomes turbid\r\nfrom the immense development of organisms which have the same\r\nmicroscopic appearance and character as those in the drop of blood.\r\nThe process is repeated many times, until the microbes are far removed\r\nfrom their original source in the blood and tissues, and a drop of the\r\nlast cultivation, whether it be the fiftieth or the hundredth, is\r\ninserted under the skin of a healthy animal selected for the\r\nexperiment. If it be true, as stated by the experimenters, that the\r\noriginal disease is thus reproduced with the microbes of at least\r\nthree or four distinct maladies, this age is distinguished by one of\r\nthe most important discoveries ever made in pathological studies. It\r\nremains to determine whether this great discovery is of general\r\napplicability to the infectious diseases with which man is afflicted.\r\nIf so, it is not improbable that we are on the eve of finding a method\r\nby which some at least of these maladies may be prevented or\r\nmitigated, as small-pox has been since the time of Jenner. The result\r\nof experiments made by Pasteur with the microbes of that fatal malady\r\nof the herbivora, known under the various names of splenic fever,\r\nanthrax, wool-sorter's disease, and charbon, encourages this belief.\r\nOriginating among the herbivorous animals, it has in many instances\r\nbeen contracted by individuals who have rapidly perished. Many engaged\r\nin assorting alpaca and mohair have lost their lives by it, some with\r\nall the symptoms of profound blood-poisoning, without external\r\nlesions, and others with redness and swelling at some point of\r\ninfection where a sore or abrasion existed, but with speedy\r\nblood-contamination.\r\n\r\nThe microbe of this malady, the Bacillus anthracis, occurs in the form\r\nof straight filaments with little movement or only with oscillation,\r\nand producing bright-shining spores. Now comes a very interesting and\r\nimportant result of experimentation: Pasteur states if several days\r\nelapse between the cultivations the virulence of the parasite\r\ndiminishes, so that he has been able to produce by inoculation with it\r\na mild and never fatal form of charbon, which affords immunity in the\r\nanimal from any subsequent attack. This opinion was sustained by a\r\ntrial experiment on sixty sheep. Toussaint and Chauveau claim that\r\nthey produce a similar attenuation of the virus by defibrinating\r\ninfected blood, heating it to 55° C. (131° F.) and filtering it. These\r\nexperiments awaken the hope that the time will come when the acute\r\ninfectious maladies in man, scarlet fever among others, will be\r\nrendered less virulent. That one of them--to wit, small-pox--has for\r\nnearly a century been under our control certainly encourages the\r\nbelief that there is some way to mitigate others of the same class\r\nwhich are equally fatal if not so loathsome.\r\n\r\nAs yet, observers do not agree in regard to the parasite which is\r\nsupposed to sustain a causative relation to scarlet fever. Klebs\r\nstates that it is highly probable that both measles and scarlet fever\r\nare produced by {490} micrococci, and he has sketched the design and\r\ndescribed the development of a microbe which he designates the Monas\r\nscarlatinosum.\r\n\r\nThe _London Medical Times and Gazette_ for Jan. 28, 1882, contains an\r\naccount of the supposed discovery of the scarlatinous microbe by\r\nEklund of Stockholm, an authority in the microscopic examination of\r\nparasites. He says that scarlet fever is rarely absent from the\r\nSwedish capital and from the barracks and dwellings on the isle of\r\nSkeppsholm. In the urine of scarlatinous patients he has constantly\r\nfound a prodigious number of discoid corpuscles, oval or round, their\r\ndiameter being less than 1/1000 millimetre and from 1/30 to 1/10 that\r\nof a red blood-cell. They are colorless or yellowish white, surrounded\r\nby a distinct cell-wall, each containing a well-defined nucleus of a\r\ndeeper hue. Sometimes one or more microbi may be seen. They exhibit\r\nrotatory or oscillatory movements, especially observed when a drop of\r\nwater is added to the fluid. They multiply, as he has frequently seen,\r\nby fission--first in the microbes, next in the nucleus, and lastly in\r\nthe cell-wall. He cannot say whether they develop into a mycelium. At\r\nany rate, the development of fine filaments seems to be exceptional.\r\nHe has never seen them adhere in moniliform chains nor massed as\r\nzooglæa. He considers them to be veritable schizomycetes, and proposes\r\nthe name Plox scindens.\r\n\r\nEklund asserts that he has found these same organisms in vast numbers\r\nin the soil- and ground-water of the isle of Skeppsholm, in the mud of\r\nthe trenches dug for the water-mains, and in the greenish mould upon\r\nthe walls of the old barracks, where scarlet fever was most rife. He\r\nstates that scarlet fever has occurred in children after drinking milk\r\nmixed with the ground-water of the island, and he observed a case\r\nwhich followed immersion in one of the trenches of the island and the\r\ndrying of the clothes in a small room. In another instance scarlet\r\nfever broke out in a block immediately after exposure of the\r\nground-water by excavations.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the discovery of this microbe under such\r\ncircumstances does not prove that it is the cause of the disease. This\r\ncan only be determined by inoculation, or by experiments which furnish\r\nthe conditions of scientific exactness. Although great progress has\r\nbeen made in parasitology during the last decade, it is evident that\r\nseveral years of observation and experimentation must elapse before it\r\nis clearly and definitely ascertained whether or to what extent\r\nmicrobes cause scarlet fever and the other exanthematic fevers with\r\nwhich it is classified.\r\n\r\nWhether the specific principle of scarlet fever be a micro-organism or\r\na chemical substance, its mode of action and effects have been\r\nascertained by clinical observations. Without doubt it commonly enters\r\nthe system by the breath, but it may enter in the ingesta, and it\r\ninfects the blood. That it resides in the blood has been ascertained\r\nby inoculation with this liquid, by which scarlet fever has been\r\nreproduced in its typical form. From the blood it enters the tissues\r\nand secretions. Hence handkerchiefs or linen containing the saliva or\r\nmucus of a patient, the epidermic scales shed abundantly in the\r\ndesquamative period, and probably also the urinary and fecal\r\nevacuations, contain the poison, so as to be highly infectious. Even\r\nthe discharge of a scarlatinous otorrhoea is thought by some to be\r\ncontagious for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nScarlatina is communicable not only by direct exposure to a patient,\r\n{491} but also by exposure to objects which happen to be in his room\r\nduring his illness, and to which the poison becomes attached, such as\r\nclothing, books, and toys; small packages, even letters, it is\r\nbelieved, from cases which have occurred, sometimes convey and\r\ndisseminate the contagious principle.\r\n\r\nIn England observations have been made which show that scarlatina has\r\nbeen communicated by infected milk. The disease occurred in the family\r\nof a milkman, and the milk, before it was distributed, remained for a\r\ntime in a kitchen which had been occupied by the patients. This milk\r\nwas taken by twelve families, and in six of these the disease occurred\r\nalmost simultaneously at a time when few cases were occurring in the\r\nlocality. There had been no direct exposure to the carrier of the milk\r\nnor to members of the affected family (Taylor). In another instance a\r\nwoman and her son had scarlet fever while they were serving milk to\r\nseveral families, and the disease appeared in all these families\r\nexcept one, which consisted of old people (Bell). It is known that\r\nmilk absorbs volatile substances so as to be flavored by them, as is\r\nshown in the experiment of placing it in an open vessel in a box with\r\na pineapple; and it may in a similar manner become infected by the\r\nspecific principle of scarlet fever, or it may be infected by detached\r\nparticles of epidermis; which is not improbable when one convalescing\r\nfrom scarlet fever is allowed to milk the cows or prepare the milk for\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe scarlatinous virus surpasses that of any other eruptive fever\r\nexcept small-pox in its tenacious attachment to objects and its\r\nportability to distant localities. Hence in the literature of the\r\ndisease are the records of many cases in which the poison was conveyed\r\nlong distances, retaining its virulence to the full extent and causing\r\nan outbreak of the malady in the localities to which it was carried.\r\nIn New York, so frequently has scarlet fever as well as measles and\r\ndiphtheria been contracted from the persons or clothing of well\r\nchildren who come from infected houses, that the Health Board now\r\nexcludes from the public schools all children who come from such\r\nhouses, even though they live on separate floors from those occupied\r\nby the sick. In one instance that came under my notice a washerwoman\r\nwhose child had scarlet fever communicated the disease to an infant in\r\nthe household where she was employed, by placing her shawl over the\r\ncradle in which it was lying. A physician of my acquaintance went from\r\na scarlet-fever patient to a family several streets distant, and took\r\none of their children upon his lap. After the usual incubative period\r\nthis child sickened with a fatal form of the malady, and the remaining\r\nchildren of the household were in time affected. In New York scarlet\r\nfever has seemed to me to be not infrequently communicated through\r\nschool-books, which, profusely illustrated by pictures and rendered\r\nattractive to the young, are often allowed to lie upon the bed of a\r\nscarlatinous patient and be handled by him during convalescence, or\r\neven during the course of the fever if it be mild. The young librarian\r\nof the circulating library of a Sunday-school, whose pupils came\r\nlargely from the tenement-houses, was occupied a considerable part of\r\na day in covering and arranging the books. After about the usual\r\nincubative period of scarlet fever he sickened with the disease. His\r\ntwo sisters were immediately removed to a rural township three hundred\r\nmiles away, and to an isolated house where scarlatina had never\r\noccurred. About one {492} month after his recovery, and after his room\r\nhad been disinfected by burning sulphur and his bed-clothes and linen\r\nhad been thoroughly washed, and all articles suspected to hold the\r\npoison had been either disinfected or destroyed, the brother visited\r\nhis sisters in the country. Three weeks subsequently to his arrival\r\none of these sisters sickened with scarlet fever, and a week later the\r\nother also. It seems that the exposure must have occurred several days\r\nafter his arrival in the country from some book or other infected\r\narticle in his possession. About two months elapsed after the last\r\ncase; the family had returned to the city, the infected room in the\r\ncountry-house had been thoroughly fumigated by burning sulphur from\r\nmorning till evening, when a little girl from an inland city remained\r\na few days in this house, and probably often entered the room where\r\nthe young ladies had been sick. In a few days she also sickened with a\r\nfatal form of scarlatina. Such histories and experiences are not\r\ninfrequent. They are common during epidemics of scarlet fever. They\r\nindicate an extraordinary attachment of the scarlatinous poison to\r\nobjects, and show that it is not gaseous nor readily volatilized.\r\n\r\nA striking example of this fixity of the poison occurred in the\r\npractice of the late Kearney Rogers, formerly a prominent and much\r\nesteemed surgeon of New York City. Six children in a family had\r\nscarlet fever. Three and a half months subsequently another child,\r\nliving at a distance, was allowed to return home and occupy the\r\napartment in which the sickness had occurred. One week subsequently to\r\nthe date of the return this child sickened with the same malady.\r\nElliotson states that a patient with scarlet fever was admitted into\r\none of the wards of St. Thomas's Hospital, and for two years\r\nsubsequently young persons who were admitted into the ward were apt to\r\ntake the disease. Richardson of London relates the following\r\nexperiences of a family whom he attended in a rural district: \"At a\r\nshort distance from one of our villages there was situated on a slight\r\neminence a small clump of laborers' cottages, with the thatch peering\r\ndown on the beds of the sleepers. A man and his wife lived in one of\r\nthese cottages with four lovely children. The poison of scarlet fever\r\nentered the poor man's door, and at once struck down one of the\r\nflock.\" The remaining children were now removed some miles away, and\r\nafter several weeks one of them was allowed to return. Within\r\ntwenty-four hours it also took the disease, and quickly died. The\r\nwalls of the cottage were now thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed, the\r\nfloors scoured, and all the wearing apparel either destroyed or\r\nwashed. Four months elapsed after the last sickness when one of the\r\nremaining children returned. \"He reached his father's cottage early in\r\nthe morning; he seemed dull the next day, and at midnight I was sent\r\nfor, to find him also the subject of scarlet fever. The disease again\r\nassumed the malignant type, and this child died.\" Richardson believes\r\nthat the contagium was attached to the thatch, which could not be\r\nthoroughly disinfected. The fact of this remarkable long-continued\r\nattachment of the poison to objects, indicating by this fixity that it\r\nis a solid, is consonant with the theory that it is an organism.\r\n\r\nINCUBATIVE PERIOD.--The duration of the incubative period varies in\r\ndifferent cases. It is sometimes less than twenty-four hours, as in\r\n{493} the above case reported by Richardson; in the following\r\nwell-known case, observed by Trousseau, it was one day. A girl arrived\r\nin Paris from Pau, where there was no scarlet fever, and occupied the\r\nsame apartment with her sister, who was sick with this disease.\r\nTwenty-four hours after her arrival she also was attacked with the\r\nsame malady.\r\n\r\nRusseberger attended a child who was exposed at noon to scarlet fever,\r\nand took the disease on the following night. B. W. Richardson\r\n(_Clinical Essays_, 1861, vol. i. p. 94) gives his own experience: He\r\nhad applied his ear to the chest of a patient suffering from scarlet\r\nfever, and was conscious of a peculiar odor emitted from the patient.\r\nHe was immediately nauseated and chilly, and from that moment he dated\r\nthe beginning of an attack of scarlet fever. In the _Transactions_ of\r\nthe Clinical Society of London, vol. xi. 1878, the late Charles\r\nMurchison gives the statistics of 75 cases, showing the incubative\r\nperiod, as follows:\r\n\r\n  In 4 cases it was not more than 24 hours.\r\n  \"  2   \"       \"       \"    \"   30   \"\r\n  \"  3   \"       \"       \"    \"   36   \"\r\n  \"  4   \"       \"       \"    \"   40   \"\r\n  \"  1   \"       \"       \"    \"   41   \"\r\n  \"  4   \"       \"       \"    \"   58   \"\r\n  \"  1   \"       \"       \"    \"   54   \"\r\n  \"  1   \"       \"       \"    \"   2-1/2 days.\r\n  \" 31   \"       \"  within (time not accurately ascertained) 4 days.\r\n  \"  2   \"   the incubation did not exceed 4-1/2 days.\r\n  \" 17   \"    \"       \"      \"         \"   5      \"\r\n  \"  2   \"    \"       \"      \"         \"   6      \"\r\n\r\nIn three cases Murchison believes that the incubation was precisely\r\nfixed at thirty-six hours, three days, and four and a half days.\r\n\r\nWatson says that a man reached Devonshire on mid-day to see his\r\ndaughter, who had scarlet fever. Two days later he was also attacked.\r\nRehn saw a child who was attacked two days after its grandmother\r\nreturned from a case of scarlet fever; and Zengerle, a girl of ten\r\nyears, residing at Wangen, where there was no scarlet fever, who took\r\nthe disease two days after her mother had returned from visiting a\r\nfamily affected with it. Loochner states that a boy aged four and a\r\nhalf years was attacked one and a half days after admission into the\r\ninfected wards of a hospital. Armistead, in his annual report on the\r\nhealth of the Newmarket rural district, states that three children,\r\ncoming from a different part of the district, visited Westley, and\r\nstayed next door to a child who had scarlet fever six weeks\r\npreviously, and who was allowed to play with these children on the\r\nevening of Aug. 13th and morning of the 14th. The family then returned\r\nhome, and on the 18th, four days after the exposure, all three\r\nchildren sickened with scarlet fever (_Brit Med. Jour._, Sept. 30,\r\n1882).\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, therefore, the incubative period, though varying in\r\ndifferent cases, is within six days. Many cases, however, occur in\r\nwhich it seems to be longer. Thus in my practice scarlet fever\r\nappeared in a family on April 26, 1882. The patient was immediately\r\nremoved to the third floor and the other children to the basement. All\r\ncommunication between the infected room and the basement was\r\nforbidden, but on May 8th, twelve days after the separation, one of\r\nthese children sickened with the disease. {494} Many observers--among\r\nwhom may be mentioned Niemeyer and Copland--believe that the\r\nincubative period may be longer than one week, but, on account of the\r\nsubtlety of the poison and the many modes of transmission, it is\r\npossible that in the instances of an apparently long incubative period\r\nthere were other and unsuspected exposures. When scarlet fever has\r\nbeen communicated by inoculation, as in the experiments of Rostan and\r\nothers, the incubative period has been about seven days, but Gerhardt\r\nstates that a man was attacked four days after an abscess was opened\r\nby a knife used upon a scarlatinous patient. This variation in the\r\nincubative period, which also occurs in some other infectious\r\ndiseases, as diphtheria, is probably due mostly to individual\r\ndifferences, some being more susceptible than others; but it may be\r\ndue partly to those obscure meteorological conditions which we\r\ndesignate the epidemic influence. Probably, as a rule, when the\r\ndisease is quickly developed after exposure, the attack is more severe\r\nthan when several days elapse.\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUSNESS.--The area of the contagiousness of scarlet fever is\r\nsmall. It apparently embraces only a few feet. Therefore, close\r\nproximity is the necessary condition of its propagation. Hence many\r\nwho are exposed, particularly of those who are remotely exposed, do\r\nnot contract the disease. There is also an idiosyncrasy in some\r\nchildren, so that they resist infection even when repeatedly and\r\nclosely exposed. In the _New York Medical Record_ for March 23, 1878,\r\nC. E. Billington states that of 90 children in 26 families who were\r\nexposed to scarlet fever, 43 contracted the disease and 47 escaped;\r\nwhereas, as is well known, comparatively few unprotected children\r\nescape pertussis, variola, varicella, or measles if exposed to either\r\nof these diseases. By strict isolation, therefore, the spread of\r\nscarlet fever is more easily prevented than that of most other acute\r\ninfectious maladies. In the New York Foundling Asylum for a number of\r\nyears children with scarlet fever were isolated in a small room\r\nattached to one of the wards. The door between the two rooms was\r\nclosed, and not opened during the continuance of the sickness.\r\nEntrance into the small room was through another door, and a nurse was\r\nassigned to the scarlet-fever cases, with strict directions that she\r\nshould not mingle with the other children. These simple precautions\r\nwere found sufficient in the various epidemics of scarlet fever which\r\noccurred in the city to prevent the spread of the malady through this\r\ninstitution; whereas, similar measures were much less effectual in\r\narresting the spread of measles and pertussis. Consequently, an\r\noutbreak of scarlet fever in this institution was usually limited to a\r\nfew cases, while the extension of measles and pertussis was arrested\r\nwith difficulty till a more efficient quarantine was established.\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS IN TYPE.--The type of scarlet fever varies greatly in\r\ndifferent epidemics, and frequently also in cases which occur in the\r\nsame epidemic, even in the same family. One child may have scarlatina\r\nso mildly that little treatment is required and convalescence soon\r\nbegins, while another has the malignant form, and soon succumbs,\r\nnotwithstanding the prompt employment of the most efficient and\r\nappropriate measures. Ordinarily, however, if the first case in a\r\nfamily be very severe, subsequent cases will present a similar type;\r\nbut there are notable exceptions. This variation in type in different\r\nyears and different epidemics is probably not equalled in any other\r\ninfectious malady. Consecutive {495} epidemics may present this\r\nvariation, or the same type may continue for a series of years, and\r\nthen, from some unknown cause, change to one milder or more severe. In\r\nEngland, during Sydenham's life, scarlet fever was so mild that he\r\nregarded it as a trivial affection, requiring little attention, like\r\nrötheln of the present time, but after the death of Sydenham, Morton\r\nand his contemporaries in London found, to their sorrow, that the type\r\nof scarlet fever was very different from that described by Sydenham's\r\npen. The late Graves of Dublin and his contemporaries treated a mild\r\ntype of scarlet fever with a very small percentage of deaths--much\r\nless than that during the preceding generation--and they attributed\r\ntheir success to their greater knowledge and more appropriate use of\r\nremedies than their ancestors possessed and employed. By and by the\r\ntype changed, the mortality of former years was restored, and they\r\ndiscovered that their previous success in saving life had been due not\r\nto their skill, but to the mild form of the malady. A distinguished\r\nphysician of New York treated more than fifty cases of scarlet fever\r\nin one of the institutions without a single death. A few months\r\nafterward the type of the malady changed, and his own son perished\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL AND OBSTETRICAL SCARLATINA.--After surgical operations, and\r\nsometimes in surgical cases not requiring operative measures, a\r\nscarlatinous efflorescence occasionally appears upon the whole or\r\nnearly the whole body, and remains for several days. The following\r\nwere cases of the kind alluded to. They occurred in Guy's Hospital,\r\nand were published by H. G. Howse in _Guy's Hospital Reports_ for\r\n1879: On March 15, 1878, Jacobson performed osteotomy upon a child\r\nsuffering from extreme rachitis. The operation was followed by a\r\nmoderate febrile movement (100° to 101°), and after three days by the\r\nappearance of an efflorescence, with sore throat and the strawberry\r\ntongue. The osteotomy had been performed under carbolic acid spray and\r\nwith all the details of antiseptic surgery. The rash soon faded, the\r\ntemperature fell, and the child, temporarily separated from the other\r\npatients from the suspicion that the disease was scarlet fever, was\r\nbrought back to the ward. The subsequent history confirmed the\r\ndiagnosis of scarlet fever, for the skin desquamated, and on April 1st\r\nabundant albumen was found in the urine. The case terminated\r\nfavorably. Three months previously the same operation had been\r\nperformed on the other leg, with no unfavorable symptoms. On April\r\n5th, three weeks after the osteotomy, a lipoma was removed from\r\nanother patient aged twenty-one years. The following day the\r\ntemperature rose to 101°, and remained at that till April 8th, when it\r\nsuddenly increased to 103°, and a rose-rash occurred over the body,\r\nwith sore throat. On April 9th, Howse excised the elbow-joint of a\r\ngirl of sixteen years having pulpy disease. On the 10th her\r\ntemperature began to increase, and on the 11th reached 105.8°. Toward\r\nevening a roseoloid eruption appeared over her body, and she was\r\nisolated. On April 12th, Dr. H. excised a fibroid bursa patellaë from\r\na woman of twenty-nine years. On the following day her temperature was\r\n99°, but on the 14th it rose to 100°, and on the evening of the 15th\r\nshe had rigors and headache. On the morning of the 16th the\r\ntemperature was 102.5°, and a roseoloid eruption occurred over the\r\nface and chest. The surgeons now perceived that an epidemic of the\r\nso-called surgical scarlatina was occurring, so as to justify the\r\npostponement of other operations.\r\n\r\n{496} In the same volume of _Guy's Hospital Reports_, James F.\r\nGoodhart gives the histories of nearly thirty cases of this disease\r\noccurring during a series of years in the same hospital. The patients\r\nwere chiefly children, having the most diverse surgical ailments,\r\namong which may be mentioned hip disease and abscess, genu valgum\r\nwithout operation, necrosis of femur, hydrocele with explorative\r\noperation, a scald, a sinus over the great trochanter, spinal disease\r\nwith abscess, tenotomy for club-foot, and vesical calculus with\r\noperation. The most common disease was caries or necrosis with\r\nabscess. In cases operated on the intervals between the operations and\r\nthe occurrence of the efflorescence varied from two days to more than\r\ntwo weeks. Goodhart, after a careful examination of these cases, came\r\nto the conclusion that they were for the most part examples of true\r\nscarlet fever, especially as a considerable proportion of them\r\noccurred in groups, and there was a known exposure of some of the\r\npatients to children admitted into the hospital with the sequelæ of\r\nscarlet fever.\r\n\r\nIn the _British Med. Jour._ for Jan., 1879, George May, Jr., reported\r\na case of efflorescence in surgical practice which appears to have\r\nbeen scarlatinous. A child was operated on for the radical cure of\r\nhernia on Dec. 4th. Toward the close of the same day he became\r\nrestless, vomited, and his pulse on the following day rose to 136.\r\nForty-eight hours after the operation a rash appeared on the chest and\r\narms, the abdomen became tense and painful, and on the following day\r\nhe died. The poison, however, in this case may have been septic.\r\n\r\nHillier remarks (_Diseases of Children_): \"In the hospital for sick\r\nchildren, of the children who contract scarlatina a very large\r\nproportion have been the subjects of a surgical operation within a\r\nweek before the rash appears.\" Gee says (Reynolds's _System of\r\nMedicine_): \"It has been doubted by some whether the scarlatiniform\r\nrash which sometimes follows operations is really scarlatinal. The\r\neruption appears from the second to the sixth day after the operation,\r\nand in the cases which have caused the doubt is very fugitive and the\r\nfirst and only symptom. Yet that the disease really is scarlet fever\r\nwould seem to be proved by the following observations: first, that the\r\ndisease occurs in epidemics; secondly, that in a given epidemic a\r\nsevere case occasionally relieves the monotonous recurrence of the\r\nvery mild form; thirdly, that a precisely similar scarlatinilla\r\nattacks in the same epidemic patients who have not been subjected to\r\noperation and who have no open sore; and lastly, by way of a veritable\r\nexperimentum crucis, that, however freely these patients are exposed\r\nto ordinary scarlet fever contagion afterward, they do not contract\r\nthat disease.\" Paget and other distinguished London surgeons who have\r\nobserved this complication of surgical cases, believe that the\r\npatients have been previously exposed to the scarlatinous poison, and\r\nthat the surgical diseases or operations furnish favorable conditions\r\nfor the occurrence of scarlet fever, so that the exposure, which\r\nprobably would have been without result in ordinary health, causes an\r\noutbreak of the malady.\r\n\r\nThose who have reported cases of this form of efflorescence have for\r\nthe most part neglected to state whether the patients had had scarlet\r\nfever previously, knowledge of which would have aided in the\r\ndiagnosis; but from an examination of the histories of cases,\r\nespecially those {497} published in the London journals in the last\r\nfour or five years, there can, I think, be little doubt that surgical\r\nmaladies of a certain kind, especially traumatism, do produce a state\r\nof system which predisposes to scarlet fever, so that this class of\r\npatients are especially liable to contract it. Therefore, in my\r\nopinion, a considerable proportion of reported cases of surgical\r\nscarlatina are genuine, but in a considerable number, perhaps an equal\r\nnumber of such cases, the histories and symptoms indicated a septic\r\nrather than scarlatinous efflorescence, and in not a few instances,\r\nwhen consultations have been held, opinions differed, some\r\ndiagnosticating scarlet fever, others septicæmia. In some of the cases\r\nI find it stated that the fauces presented the normal appearance. Now,\r\nfaucial redness is so generally present in scarlet fever, antedating\r\nthat of the skin and coexisting with it, that its absence is strong\r\nevidence that the disease is not scarlatinous. Moreover, when, as was\r\ntrue of certain of the reported cases, the rash appeared irregularly\r\nupon the surface, and faded away in two or three days with the\r\nabatement of the fever, and the conditions for septic absorption were\r\npresent, the efflorescence was probably septicæmic.\r\n\r\nThe following were apparently cases of septicæmia efflorescence: A\r\nchild aged five years (_Brit. Med. Jour._, Feb. 15, 1879) had\r\ninflammation of the lymphatic glands in the groin, which suppurated.\r\nAt the time when the abscess was fully formed a rash appeared over the\r\nentire body. It consisted of numerous red points, but was paler than\r\nthat of ordinary scarlet fever; temperature never above 99°; no sore\r\nthroat nor desquamation of cuticle. No child exposed to her took\r\nscarlet fever, and her sickness could not be traced to infection. In\r\nthe _British Med. Jour._, Jan. 4, 1879, L. Braxton Hicks states that\r\nhis son, attending school at Reading, was seized with a severe attack\r\nof pyrexia, accompanied on the second day by delirium and the\r\noccurrence of a rash like scarlet fever over the entire surface. He\r\nhad no decided redness of the fauces, though it was perhaps slightly\r\nflushed. The right buttock was swollen from inflammation, and a large,\r\ndeep-seated abscess formed near the tuberosity of the ischium. When\r\nthe delirium abated the boy said that he was standing the day before\r\nthe fever began with his legs far apart, when a schoolfellow stretched\r\nthem farther by suddenly pulling on one of them. The rash, which was\r\nnearly universal, lasted three days, and was not followed by\r\ndesquamation. No case of scarlet fever occurred in the school before\r\nor afterward. In the same volume of the _British Medical Journal_,\r\nSurgeon Frolliott of the East India Service relates the case of a\r\nprivate, aged twenty-three years, and three years in India, who, when\r\non duty in the Punjab, was injured by the explosion of an Afghan\r\npowder-magazine. The accident occurred Dec. 21, 1878. On Dec. 25th a\r\nbright scarlet rash appeared upon the abdomen and spread over the\r\nentire body. The following day the eruption was very vivid, like a\r\nboiled lobster, and it lasted five days. The temperature, which in the\r\nbeginning had been 101°, abated to the normal after the rash appeared.\r\nNo soreness of throat nor redness of the buccal surface occurred, but\r\nthe epidermis desquamated even from the palms of the hands and soles\r\nof the feet. Now, the febrile movement of scarlet fever does not cease\r\nwhile the efflorescence is distinct. It does not even diminish when\r\nthe eruption appears, while in the above case it fell to the normal--a\r\ncommon {498} occurrence in septicæmia, even when the blood-poisoning\r\nis profound. Moreover, scarlet fever is so rare in India that\r\nFrolliott, after twelve years' service, had only heard of one case\r\namong Europeans and natives. The surgeons who consulted over the case\r\nof this private disagreed in opinion, some regarding the disease as\r\nsepticæmic, others as scarlatinous. But a better knowledge of the\r\nclinical history of scarlet fever on the part of these army surgeons\r\nwould, I think, have removed all doubt as to the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of some reputable surgeons that the exposure of\r\ntraumatic patients to the scarlatinous poison sometimes aggravates the\r\ninflammation of wounds, causing them to assume an unhealthy appearance\r\neven though no scarlatina be produced. The late Solly made the remark,\r\n\"Whenever a case of surgery in private practice takes on a highly\r\nphlegmonous appearance I am always sure to find break out, in the\r\ninmates of the house, either erysipelas or scarlet fever\" (_British\r\nMed. Jour._, Feb. 15, 1879). We will see that the scarlatinous poison\r\nsometimes causes pharyngitis or nephritis without producing the\r\ngeneral disease. In a similar manner it seems that it may aggravate\r\nopen wounds, intensifying the inflammation in them, while there is no\r\nefflorescence or other symptom to show that scarlatina itself is\r\npresent. The poison appears to act entirely locally in such cases.\r\n\r\nPaget, in his _Clinical Lectures_, says: \"I think it not improbable\r\nthat in some cases results occurring with obscure symptoms within two\r\nor three days after operations have been due to the scarlet-fever\r\npoison, hindered in some way from its usual progress.\" Playfair, in\r\nhis remarks on the puerperal state, adds: \"Mr. Spencer Wells informs\r\nme that he has seen cases of surgical pyæmia which he had reason to\r\nbelieve originated in the scarlatinal poison; and his well-known\r\nsuccess as an ovariotomist is no doubt, in a great measure, to be\r\nattributed to his extreme care in seeing that no one likely to come in\r\ncontact with his patients has been exposed to any such source of\r\ninfection.\" Opinions like these, held by such prominent members of the\r\nprofession and sustained by many observations, should certainly induce\r\nphysicians to prevent, so far as possible, any exposure of their\r\nsurgical patients, especially if they have any sores or wounds,\r\nwhether by traumatism or the scalpel, to the scarlatinal poison.\r\n\r\nOBSTETRICAL SCARLATINA.--Women during convalescence after childbirth\r\nare very liable to contract scarlet fever. In the New York Infant\r\nAsylum, which has maternity wards, a woman was admitted from a house\r\nin which scarlet fever was prevailing, and assigned to a cot next that\r\noccupied by one of the waiting women, who was confined soon afterward.\r\nHer labor was favorable, but three days afterward she took scarlet\r\nfever, and another lying-in-patient contracted it from her. The sore\r\nthroat and desquamation were characteristic. It has come to my\r\nknowledge that a physician of New York, in whose family scarlet fever\r\nwas occurring, attended three women in succession in their\r\nconfinement, and all contracted scarlet fever, which presented the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms, and two of them died. Experienced and\r\ncautious physicians of New York, aware of the danger, do not go\r\ndirectly from a scarlatinous patient to an obstetrical case, but avoid\r\nthe risk by intermediate visits to other patients or by remaining for\r\na time in the open air.\r\n\r\n{499} Playfair, remarking on this subject, says: \"There is good reason\r\nto believe that the contagium of zymotic diseases may produce a form\r\nof disease indistinguishable from ordinary puerperal septicæmia, and\r\npresenting none of the characteristic features of the specific\r\ncomplaint from which the contagium was derived. This is admitted to be\r\na fact by the majority of our most eminent British obstetricians,\r\nalthough it does not seem to be allowed by continental authorities,\r\nand it is strongly controverted by some writers in this country. It is\r\ncertainly difficult to reconcile this with the theory of septicæmia,\r\nand we are not in a position to give a satisfactory explanation of it.\r\nI believe, however, that the evidence in favor of the possibility of\r\npuerperal septicæmia originating in this way is too strong to be\r\nassailable. The scarlatinal poison is that regarding which the\r\ngreatest number of observations has been made. Numerous cases of this\r\nkind are to be found scattered through our obstetric literature, but\r\nthe largest number are to be met with in a paper by Braxton Hicks. Out\r\nof 68 cases of puerperal disease seen in consultation, no less than 37\r\nwere distinctly traceable to the scarlatinal poison. Of these, 20 had\r\nthe characteristic rash of the disease, but the remaining 17, although\r\nthe history clearly proved exposure to the contagium of scarlet fever,\r\nshowed none of its usual symptoms, and were not to be distinguished\r\nfrom ordinary typical cases of the so-called puerperal fever. On the\r\ntheory that it is impossible for the specific contagious diseases to\r\nbe modified by the puerperal state, we have to admit that one\r\nphysician met with 17 cases of puerperal septicæmia in which, by a\r\nmere coincidence, the contagion of scarlet fever had been traced, and\r\nthat the disease nevertheless originated from some other source--a\r\nhypothesis so improbable that its mere mention carries its own\r\nrefutation.\"\r\n\r\nParturition, like traumatism, furnishes in an eminent degree the\r\nconditions in which septic poisoning occurs, and the efflorescence\r\nwhich often accompanies septicæmia bears, as we have seen, a very\r\nclose resemblance to that of scarlet fever. Hence in many instances\r\nthe same difficulty is present in making a differential diagnosis\r\nbetween septic and scarlatinous blood-poisoning in obstetrical cases\r\nwhich occurs in surgical practice. But, according to my observations,\r\nan efflorescence occurring during the week following parturition is in\r\nmost instances septic. It is only in exceptional cases that it is\r\nscarlatinous, and there is little danger that the accoucheur, engaged\r\nin general practice and visiting scarlatinous patients, will\r\ncommunicate scarlet fever through his person or clothing if he\r\nexercise proper precautions. His short stay in the sick room and his\r\nout-door exercise in visiting cases prevent infection of his person or\r\ndress. But if, as Playfair believes, the scarlatinal poison sometimes\r\nproduces in parturient women a puerperal fever in which the\r\ncharacteristic scarlatinal symptoms are lacking, and which, in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge, is not distinguishable from ordinary\r\nseptic fever, certainly the scarlatinous virus sustains a much more\r\nfrequent causative relation to childbed fever than has been heretofore\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nInfants under the age of six months do not ordinarily contract scarlet\r\nfever, although fully exposed, and those under four months nearly\r\npossess immunity. Still, this disease has been observed in new-born\r\ninfants, contracted, apparently, through the placental circulation.\r\n{500} Tourtual states that a woman waited upon her own husband and\r\nchild, both of whom had scarlet fever, during the eighth and ninth\r\nmonths of her pregnancy, till near her confinement. Though she had no\r\nsymptoms of scarlet fever, her infant had unusual redness of the skin\r\nand buccal surface and difficulty of swallowing up to the fifth day.\r\nOn the ninth day desquamation began, and at a later stage the nails of\r\nthe fingers and toes separated. A case having a history in some\r\nrespects similar is related by Megnert, but the symptoms were\r\nanomalous for scarlet fever, and the disease may have been ordinary\r\nseptic fever. On the other hand, in one instance in my practice a\r\nmother had scarlet fever, beginning about the third day after her\r\nconfinement, and although she suckled her infant and it was constantly\r\nin bed with her, it had no symptoms of scarlet fever, although it\r\nbecame affected immediately afterward by a severe form of eczema,\r\nprobably from the altered quality of the milk; and in two instances\r\nobserved by Murchison new-born infants remained healthy, although\r\ntheir mothers suffered from scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nAfter the age of six months the liability to scarlet fever increases\r\ntill the close of infancy, children between the ages of six months and\r\none year being less liable to contract the malady than during the\r\nsecond year, and those in the second year being less liable to it than\r\nthose in the third year. Murchison collected the statistics of deaths\r\nfrom scarlet fever in England and Wales during a series of years\r\nending with 1861. The number of deaths aggregated 148,829, and the\r\npercentage of deaths at different ages was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Deaths under 1 year,           6.7  per cent.\r\n    \"    between 1 and 2 years, 14.09  \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"    2  \"  3   \"    16.00  \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"    3  \"  4   \"    15.13  \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"    4  \"  5   \"    11.9   \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"    5  \" 10   \"    25.9   \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"   10  \" 15   \"     5.8   \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"   15  \" 25   \"     2.6   \"   \"\r\n    \"       \"   25  \" 35   \"     0.8   \"   \"\r\n    \"      over age of 35 years, 0.8   \"   \"\r\n\r\nAmong the deaths were ten cases above the age of eighty-five years, so\r\nthat scarlet fever, though especially a disease of childhood, may\r\noccur in any decade of life; but old age, like early infancy, almost\r\npossesses immunity from it.\r\n\r\nI have preserved the records of the ages of 145 consecutive cases\r\noccurring in private practice. If we add to these 58 cases observed by\r\nProf. Octerlony (_Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, July, 1882) we have the\r\nstatistics of the ages of 203 cases, which are embraced in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n  Under 1 year,         3\r\n  From  1 to  2 years, 25\r\n    \"   2  \"  3   \"    43\r\n    \"   3  \"  5   \"    57\r\n    \"   5  \" 10   \"    53\r\n    \"  10  \" 15   \"    13\r\n    \"  15  \" 20   \"     3\r\n    \"  20  \" 30   \"     4\r\n    \"  30  \" 40   \"     2\r\n                      ---\r\n               Total, 203\r\n\r\n{501} CLINICAL FACTS REGARDING SCARLET FEVER.--As a rule, scarlet\r\nfever occurs but once, one attack conferring immunity from the disease\r\nfor life; but there are exceptions. In 1869, I attended a child with\r\nfatal scarlet fever who three years previously, it was stated, had\r\npassed through a first attack with all the characteristic symptoms.\r\nThe following case occurred in a family attended by the late Dr.\r\nHerzog: R----, a boy of six years, had scarlet fever in a mild form in\r\nJanuary and February, 1875, followed by moderate desquamation. In July\r\nof the same year he was kicked by a horse in the street, receiving a\r\ndeep scalp-wound which required three stitches. Three days afterward\r\nhe had, to appearance, a second attack of scarlet fever, attended by\r\nhigh febrile movement, and followed also by desquamation. It was\r\nbelieved by Dr. H. to be a genuine case, and was so treated. I am not\r\nable to state as regards the presence of soreness of the throat, and\r\ndoubt arises whether this second attack may not have been septicæmic.\r\nIn April, 1876, a third attack occurred, which I saw from the\r\nbeginning. It was accompanied by all the characteristic\r\nsymptoms--injection of the fauces, an efflorescence continuing the\r\nusual time, followed by desquamation and albuminuria, the latter\r\ncontinuing several weeks. Richardson states that three distinct\r\nattacks occurred in his own person, and a student attending the\r\nlecture at which this was mentioned informed the doctor that he also\r\nhad had scarlet fever three times.\r\n\r\nSometimes a second attack occurs so soon after the first that it has\r\nbeen described as a relapse. The following was a case in point in the\r\npractice of Godneff (_Meditz. Vestnik._, No. iv., _N.Y. Med. Rec._,\r\nApril 30, 1881): A youth of seventeen years contracted scarlet fever\r\nwhile taking care of a child. It began with a chill, and he had the\r\nusual efflorescence, sore throat, and tumefaction of the cervical\r\nglands. An exudation appeared upon his tonsils and uvula, and his\r\ntemperature reached 104°. The urine contained a trace of albumen, the\r\nrash in due time faded, and the epidermis exfoliated. On the fifteenth\r\nday, when he was about ready to leave the hospital, he again had a\r\nchill, followed by fever. The temperature reached 105.2°, the rash\r\nreappeared over the entire surface except the face, diphtheritic\r\nexudations occurred upon the fauces, and the urine, the quantity of\r\nwhich was diminished, again became albuminous. This second\r\nefflorescence faded on the twenty-fourth day, and on the\r\ntwenty-seventh exfoliation began. Hillier says: \"I have seen a young\r\nwoman in the fever hospital suffering from a second attack of\r\nscarlatina, the first attack having occurred five weeks previously.\r\nShe had quite recovered from her first illness, and was acting as\r\nnurse. In both seizures the rash, the sore throat, and other symptoms\r\nwere characteristic. The relapse or recurrence was less severe than\r\nthe primary disease.\" Cases of a fourth, or even of a greater number\r\nof attacks, have been reported. The first seizure is sometimes milder,\r\nbut in other instances is more severe, than those which follow.\r\n\r\nExposure to the scarlatinous poison not infrequently produces\r\npharyngitis without the occurrence of scarlatina, and the inflammation\r\nis apt to be severe, accompanied by pain in swallowing and marked\r\nfebrile movement. This phlegmasia is distinguished from scarlet fever\r\nby its shorter duration and the absence of the efflorescence. It\r\noccurs in adults as well as in children, and in those who have had, as\r\nwell as in those who have not {502} had scarlatina. So far as I have\r\nobserved, it is very seldom accompanied or followed by any of the\r\ncomplications or sequelæ so common in and after scarlet fever. It\r\ncannot be distinguished from ordinary pharyngitis except in the manner\r\nin which it occurs, and one attack does not preclude another. The late\r\nGeorge B. Wood made the remark that he never attended a case of\r\nscarlet fever without suffering from sore throat. The following were\r\nexamples of this form of pharyngitis: On Jan. 17th, 1882, I was called\r\nto a boy of three years with severe scarlet fever, ushered in by\r\nconvulsions. On the following day his sister, aged seven and\r\nthree-fourths years, whom I had attended a year previously during a\r\nsevere attack of scarlatina, and who had been almost constantly with\r\nthe brother, became very ill, with a temperature of 103.5°.\r\nExamination revealed severe inflammation of the fauces, without\r\npseudo-membrane or any other exudation except muco-pus. On Jan. 19th\r\nan older brother, nine years, whom I had attended in scarlet fever\r\nthree years previously, was affected in the same way, his temperature\r\nbeing 104° and his respiration guttural and noisy, especially during\r\nsleep, in consequence of the great amount of faucial swelling. At\r\ntimes he was delirious. The inflammation in both cases began to abate\r\nabout the third day, and had disappeared by the close of the week.\r\nThat the contagium of scarlet fever may be received into the system\r\nand cause pharyngitis, while the patient has immunity from scarlet\r\nfever through a previous attack, and that this inflammation may occur\r\nany number of times, as in the case of Dr. Wood, are remarkable facts.\r\n\r\nNow and then cases occur which appear to show that the scarlatinous\r\npoison may affect the kidneys, producing nephritis, while there is no\r\nother manifestation of its influence. Thus in my practice a lady of\r\nabout forty-five years constantly attended her son, sleeping by his\r\nside, during an attack of scarlet fever. Her health had previously\r\nbeen good. When the boy was convalescent, as her appetite failed and\r\nshe was indisposed, a careful examination revealed the fact that she\r\nhad albuminuria, although she had had no sore throat or other symptom\r\nof scarlet fever. After several weeks of treatment her disease was\r\nremoved, and she has remained well since. In the _British Med. Jour._\r\nfor Nov. 29, 1879, it is stated that in a family four girls were found\r\nto be suffering from desquamative nephritis. One of them had recently\r\nhad scarlet fever, but the other three had presented no symptoms\r\nwhatever of this disease. Such cases, although probably rare, appear\r\nto show that, as the scarlatinous poison may produce inflammation of\r\nthe fauces without the occurrence of scarlet fever, so it may cause\r\nnephritis without producing the general disease, or apparently\r\ndisturbing the functions, or changing the state of other parts, except\r\nthe kidneys.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--ORDINARY FORM. Scarlet fever usually begins abruptly, so\r\nthat the exact time of its commencement can be fixed. If any\r\npremonitory symptoms occur, they are slight, so as scarcely to attract\r\nattention, as languor or the appearance of fatigue. A dusky aspect of\r\nthe surface may occasionally be observed during the few hours\r\npreceding the attack. In some children the first symptom is\r\nchilliness, and occasionally a distinct chill occurs. In the adult a\r\nchill is ordinarily the first symptom. With or without the initial\r\nchilliness, febrile movement occurs, of variable intensity according\r\nto the severity of the type, and {503} accompanied by such symptoms as\r\nusually arise in a febrile state of system, as cephalalgia, anorexia,\r\nand thirst. The pulse rises to 110, 120, or more per minute, the\r\ntemperature to 102°, 103°, or 104°; the skin is hot, face flushed, and\r\nthe eyes bright. Even in cases that are not malignant or grave, and\r\nthat give indications of a favorable result, there is often more or\r\nless stupor, with transient delirium and sudden starting or twitching\r\nof the extremities, showing that the cerebro-spinal axis is involved.\r\n\r\nVomiting is a common symptom in the beginning of scarlet fever,\r\noccurring before the appearance of the efflorescence. It therefore has\r\ndiagnostic value when the nature of the case is still doubtful. In\r\nsome patients it is an initial symptom, but in others some hours have\r\nelapsed when it occurs. I recorded its presence or absence in 214\r\npatients, with the following result: present in 162 patients, absent\r\nin 52. In severe forms of the disease it is rarely absent, and if it\r\ndo not occur it is probable that the case will be mild, requiring\r\nlittle treatment and having a favorable termination. In epidemics of\r\nunusual mildness the number of cases without vomiting may be in excess\r\nof those in which this symptom occurs. It appears to be due to\r\nfunctional disturbance of the cerebro-spinal system, and it may\r\ntherefore be properly regarded as a nervous symptom. In severe cases\r\nthe vomiting is apt to be repeated, not only on the first but on\r\nsubsequent days, and we shall see that in cases of great gravity, in\r\nwhich a fatal termination is not improbable, persistent vomiting, by\r\nwhich the food and stimulants so urgently required are rejected,\r\ninterferes seriously with successful treatment. In a few cases\r\nembraced in my statistics nausea without vomiting was recorded. The\r\nbowels in ordinary scarlatina act regularly or are slightly\r\nconstipated. Diarrhoea, which so commonly accompanies the persistent\r\nvomiting in malignant cases, if it occur in this form of the malady is\r\nslight and transient and due to accidental causes. The food, if it be\r\ngiven in the liquid form and cool, is usually taken readily, on\r\naccount of the thirst, except when deglutition is rendered painful by\r\nthe pharyngitis.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms pertaining to the nervous system vary according to the\r\nseverity of the disease and the temperament of the patient. Many\r\nchildren during the progress of the common form of scarlet fever\r\npresent a dull or apathetic appearance. They lie much of the time with\r\ntheir eyes closed; others are more restless, and not a few, if the\r\nfever be considerable, have occasional twitching of the limbs and more\r\nor less headache. Eclampsia sometimes occurs on the first day,\r\nespecially in those predisposed to it, even when the subsequent course\r\nof the disease is mild and favorable. This complication, very grave\r\nand usually fatal when it occurs at a later stage, is in most\r\ninstances, when it takes place on the first day, readily controlled by\r\nproper remedies and with little detriment to the patient. But if it be\r\nattended by high elevation of temperature and marked drowsiness,\r\napproaching the comatose state, it is very serious upon the first as\r\nwell as upon subsequent days. Nervous symptoms occurring in the\r\nbeginning of scarlet fever, when it has the ordinary favorable type,\r\nbegin to abate in three or four days, but if they supervene at a later\r\ndate, and especially in the declining stage, they possess more\r\ngravity, since they then not infrequently result from and indicate\r\nrenal complication.\r\n\r\n{504} Early in the disease, nearly as soon as the commencement of the\r\nfever, the faucial and buccal surfaces become inflamed, as shown by\r\nredness, swelling, and tenderness. The physician summoned in the\r\nbeginning of an attack will already, at his first visit, observe\r\nhyperæmia of the fauces, with points of deeper injection than over the\r\ngeneral faucial surface, and soon the buccal surface also\r\nparticipates. The inflammation at first produces preternatural\r\ndryness, and this is followed by a viscid secretion. The papillæ of\r\nthe tongue enlarge and become prominent, giving rise to the appearance\r\nknown as strawberry tongue which is so common in scarlet fever. This\r\nstate of the buccal and faucial membrane continues throughout the\r\ndisease. A thin fur appears upon the tongue on the first day, and it\r\nincreases on the second and third days, after which it is apt to be\r\ndetached, exposing the surface of the organ, which has a deep red hue,\r\nbut in not a few patients the fur remains or is reproduced as soon as\r\nshed. Except in the mildest cases the Schneiderian membrane also\r\nparticipates in the inflammation as the disease advances, so that a\r\nthin, irritating discharge, containing leucocytes or pus-cells, flows\r\nfrom the nostrils. The skin is hot and dry, and cutaneous\r\ntranspiration nearly checked. The respiratory system is rarely\r\ninvolved in any notable manner unless there be a complication. Many\r\nhave no cough whatever, while others have a slight cough, due to the\r\nfact that the inflammation, of a catarrhal form, has extended from the\r\nfauces to the surface of the glottis. Slight acceleration of\r\nrespiration, corresponding with the degree of fever, may also be\r\nobserved. The kidneys commonly act regularly and normally during the\r\nfirst days, any serious impairment of their functions being rare\r\nbefore the close of the first week.\r\n\r\nWhen the symptoms described above have continued from six to eighteen\r\nhours the efflorescence appears. It is first observed about the ears,\r\nneck, and shoulders, in reddish patches fading into the normal hue.\r\nThese patches extend and unite, and in the course of a few hours the\r\ntrunk and upper extremities, and finally the legs, are covered. The\r\nscarlatinous rash usually, when fully developed, resembles that\r\nproduced by external heat or the application of a sinapism. It has\r\nbeen likened to the appearance of a boiled lobster, but there are\r\nnumerous minute points of a deeper or duskier hue than the surface\r\ngenerally. In many patients the rash appears, especially over the\r\nabdomen and lower extremities, as minute, thickly-set points, with the\r\nskin of normal appearance between them. Henoch of Berlin says of\r\nscarlet fever: \"In general, the moderate grades of eruption prevail,\r\nthe skin, when seen from a distance, presenting a diffuse, more or\r\nless scarlet redness, while on closer inspection it is found that this\r\nredness is composed of innumerable red points closely situated\r\ntogether, and separated from one another by very small paler portions\r\nof skin. The dark-red points appear to correspond to the\r\nhair-follicles.\" On passing the finger over the efflorescence no\r\ndistinct prominences are observed, but a sensation of roughness is\r\nsometimes imparted from engorgement of the cutaneous papillæ. The rash\r\ndisappears on pressure, but it immediately reappears when the pressure\r\nis removed. Its slow return is evidence of sluggish circulation, and\r\nit indicates a grave and dangerous form of the malady. The color is\r\nthen usually a dusky instead of a bright red. The efflorescence is\r\nmost marked in dependent parts, as along the back, over the chest and\r\n{505} abdomen, and in the flexures of the joints. Parts pressed upon\r\nby the bed-clothes, which confine and intensify the heat, present a\r\ndeeper coloration than other portions of the surface. Often,\r\nespecially in mild cases, the rash is absent from portions of the\r\nsurface where it commonly appears, while it presents a typical\r\ncharacter elsewhere. Tardy and incomplete establishment of the rash\r\nwhen the symptoms indicate an attack of ordinary or more than ordinary\r\nseverity is commonly due to some perturbating cause, especially\r\ndiarrhoea. In the _London Lancet_ for Aug. 16, 1879, cases are related\r\nof supposed scarlet fever without the rash, cases in which pharyngitis\r\nand stomatitis with the strawberry tongue occurred, without\r\nefflorescence upon the skin; but it is to be remembered, as stated\r\nabove, that the inflammations which commonly attend or follow scarlet\r\nfever, particularly the pharyngitis and nephritis, not infrequently\r\noccur in those who have already had scarlatina, and occur more than\r\nonce from fresh exposure to scarlatina patients. These inflammations,\r\noccurring under such circumstances, appear to be purely local\r\nmaladies, produced by the scarlatinous virus; and it seems to me a\r\nquestion whether, in the so-called scarlatina without efflorescence,\r\nthe inflammations which are present, and which undoubtedly have a\r\nscarlatinous origin, are not local in their nature, instead of being\r\nlocal manifestations of the constitutional disease. The burning and\r\nitching sensation produced by the rash increases the restlessness of\r\nthe patient, and is sometimes the most annoying of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe temperature in the common favorable forms of scarlet fever usually\r\nvaries from 101° in the mildest cases to 103° or 104° in those more\r\nsevere. If it attain 105° or over, the case is properly designated\r\ngrave or severe. The febrile movement commonly fluctuates but little\r\nfrom day to day till the fourth or fifth day, when, if the case be\r\nfavorable and no complication occur, it begins to decline. The\r\ntemperature is as high in the beginning of the attack as subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms pertaining to the digestive system during the initial\r\nperiod of scarlet fever have been sufficiently described. The\r\nsubsequent symptoms referable to this system do not differ materially\r\nfrom those present in the beginning, except the absence of vomiting.\r\nThe lips are dry and often cracked. The inflammation of the mouth and\r\nthroat continues, with anorexia and thirst. With the decline of the\r\ndisease the appetite gradually returns, but it is not till the close\r\nof the second week that it is fully restored. Great and continued\r\ndisturbance of the digestive apparatus, seriously interfering with the\r\nnutrition, pertains to the malignant forms of scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nThe urine is high-colored, and in robust children during the first\r\ndays of scarlet fever it frequently deposits urates on cooling. Gee,\r\nwho has carefully investigated the state of the urine in scarlet\r\nfever, says that the quantity of water is diminished and the urea is\r\nnot necessarily increased during the pyrexia; that the chloride of\r\nsodium is diminished till the fourth, fifth, or sixth day, and that\r\nthe phosphoric acid is diminished during the climax of the pyrexia,\r\nthough not during the first three or four days. In one case he made a\r\ndaily estimation of the amount of uric acid, and found it greatly\r\ndiminished on the second and third days, normal on the fourth, and\r\nmuch increased on the fifth. He believes that similar variations are\r\ncommon in the quantity of the products excreted {506} in the urine.\r\nBile may also appear in the urine, coincident with a yellow tinge of\r\nthe conjunctiva.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Article on scarlatina in Reynolds's _System of\r\nMedicine_.]\r\n\r\nThe duration of scarlet fever varies in different cases. If the attack\r\nbe very mild, with little efflorescence, the febrile movement may\r\ndecline by the fourth or fifth day; but if the disease be severe,\r\nlittle or no amelioration of symptoms may occur before the twelfth or\r\nfourteenth day, even when no complication has occurred to increase the\r\ntemperature or cause aggravation of symptoms. Octerlony, who estimated\r\nthe duration of scarlet fever from the commencement of febrile\r\nsymptoms to \"the disappearance of fever, with marked improvement in\r\nleading symptoms,\" ... \"found that the average duration of the disease\r\nin forty cases was six and one-sixth days. The minimum duration in a\r\nvery slightly-marked case was three days: the maximum duration was\r\nfourteen days.\" In general, prolongation of fever beyond the usual\r\ntime is due to some complication--more frequently to unusually severe\r\npharyngitis, with accompanying cellulitis, than to any other cause.\r\n\r\nThe malady whose commencement was so abrupt declines gradually. In\r\nordinary cases, by the close of the first week or in the beginning of\r\nthe second the rash becomes less and less distinct, and finally\r\ndisappears, as do also the redness and swelling of the buccal and\r\nfaucial surfaces. The engorgement of the tonsils and of the papillæ of\r\nthe tongue subsides, the appetite returns, the countenance brightens\r\nand becomes natural, and the child, who during the height of the fever\r\nscarcely noticed objects or noticed them with indifference or even\r\nrepugnance, can be amused as before his sickness.\r\n\r\nDesquamation succeeds. This begins at about the sixth day, and is not\r\ncompleted till the tenth or twelfth day; often not till the close of\r\nthe third or in the fourth week. The amount of desquamation\r\ncorresponds with the intensity and duration of the efflorescence, or\r\nrather of the dermatitis which produces the efflorescence. If the\r\nefflorescence have been slight and partial, it will be slight, perhaps\r\nscarcely appreciable, but if the rash have been general, full, and\r\nprotracted, exfoliation occurs upon every part. It begins about the\r\nface and neck, and within a day or two appears upon other parts. Where\r\nthe skin is thin the epidermis as it is detached presents a\r\nfurfuracous appearance; where it is thick, as upon the palms of the\r\nhands or soles of the feet, it separates in layers of considerable\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief description of scarlet fever when it pursues its\r\nnormal course without any disturbing element, but there is no other\r\ndisease in which complications and sequelæ so frequently occur. The\r\nliability to them renders the prognosis in every case doubtful. They\r\nlargely increase the percentage of deaths. They occur both in mild and\r\nsevere forms of scarlatina.\r\n\r\nThe difference in type in different cases and epidemics has already\r\nbeen alluded to. Scarlet fever is sometimes so mild, and its symptoms\r\nso slight, that the diagnosis is necessarily uncertain. In the spring\r\nof 1866 I was called to an infant thirteen months old who had slight\r\npharyngitis and an indistinct rash over a part of the surface. In two\r\ndays the eruption had disappeared, and the health within a day or two\r\nlater was apparently fully restored. Diagnosis would have been\r\ndoubtful except for sequelæ {507} which clearly indicated the\r\nscarlatinous nature of the attack. In another instance two children\r\npassed through the entire course of scarlet fever playing every day in\r\nthe street. Although the intelligent grandmother saw the rash upon\r\nthem, its nature was not suspected, as it was midsummer and cases of\r\nprickly heat common, till nearly two weeks afterward, when one of the\r\nchildren had nephritis and anasarca ending fatally. In cases so mild\r\nas these the heat of surface is but slightly increased, the pulse but\r\nlittle accelerated, and the rash usually does not occupy so much of\r\nthe surface as in ordinary cases; the appetite is not lost, though\r\ndiminished, and the thirst is moderate.\r\n\r\nBetween scarlet fever so mild that it terminates in four or five days,\r\nand that of the grave or malignant type presently to be described, all\r\ngrades of severity exist. Scarlet fever occurs in all forms from mild\r\nto severe, but certain symptoms characterize grave or malignant\r\ncases--symptoms which are absent or much less prominent in ordinary\r\nscarlet fever. Therefore the grouping of cases according to the type\r\nis proper, and facilitates the studying of the disease.\r\n\r\nGRAVE FORM (malignant scarlet fever).--This form of the disease is in\r\nsome epidemics common, while in others it is rare. The symptoms which\r\ncharacterize it are severe from the beginning, those of the nervous\r\nsystem predominating at first, such as intense cephalalgia,\r\nrestlessness or stupor, sudden twitching of the muscles, and perhaps\r\ndelirium, or even convulsions. Many pass rapidly into coma and die\r\nwithin two or three days, succumbing to the intensity of the\r\nscarlatinous poison while the malady is still in its commencement. The\r\nrash is dusky. It disappears by pressure, and returns slowly when the\r\npressure is removed, showing extreme sluggishness of the capillary\r\ncirculation. Some patients are very drowsy, lying in a semi-comatose\r\nstate except when aroused, and if aroused are very restless. Others\r\nare constantly restless. If placed in one position on the bed, they\r\nthrow themselves in another in a half-conscious or unconscious state.\r\nThey do not speak, or they mutter like those affected by the graver\r\nforms of typhus, calling the names of playmates or talking\r\nincoherently about things which interested them when well. The\r\nthermometer placed in the axilla is found to rise above 103°, which is\r\na safe average, to 105° or even 107°, and the heat of the surface is\r\npungent except when the case approaches a fatal termination, when the\r\nextremities, ears, and nose may be cool while the trunk and head are\r\nextremely hot. The pulse from the first is rapid, ranging from 130 as\r\nthe minimum in a malignant case to a frequency which can scarcely be\r\ncounted. A very frequent pulse is nearly always feeble and\r\ncompressible. Irritability of the stomach is one of the most common\r\nsymptoms in grave cases, so that many patients immediately reject the\r\nnutriment and stimulants which are so urgently required to sustain the\r\nvital powers. The vomiting, therefore, if frequent and severe, greatly\r\nincreases the danger, and in not a few instances this symptom is\r\nassociated with diarrhoea, which also tends to increase the\r\nprostration.\r\n\r\nSevere and dangerous nervous symptoms, due to the intensity or\r\nactivity of the scarlatinous poison, occur chiefly within the first\r\nthree or four days. Grinding the teeth, sudden muscular twitching,\r\ndelirium, convulsions, and profound stupor occur for the most part\r\nwithin this time. Afterward the danger is mainly from exhaustion,\r\nunless in the {508} second week or subsequently, when nervous symptoms\r\nmay arise from uræmia.\r\n\r\nThose who survive the onset of malignant scarlet fever often have in\r\nthe course of a few days severe pharyngitis, with extension of the\r\ninflammation to the lymphatic glands and connective tissue around the\r\nangle of the jaw. These inflammations cause more or less external\r\nswelling. The faucial turgescence around the entrance of the larynx,\r\nwith the accompanying secretion of viscid mucus or muco-pus, often\r\ncauses noisy respiration, and many at this stage of the attack breathe\r\nwith the mouth constantly open to facilitate the ingress of air.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, no discharge occurs at first from the nasal surface, but\r\nas the disease continues, if the type remain severe, defluxion of thin\r\nmuco-pus takes place from the Schneiderian surface, which frequently\r\nexcoriates the cheek. The lips also are apt to be sore and swollen.\r\n\r\nIn malignant cases the disease is more protracted than when the type\r\nis mild. Thus in a recent case in my practice the rash was still\r\ndistinct at the close of the second week, though the temperature had\r\nfallen from 105° to 102° and some desquamation had appeared. Long\r\ncontinuance of the febrile movement is, however, oftener attributable\r\nto some inflammatory complication than to the primary disease.\r\n\r\nIn all epidemics of a severe type cases now and then occur in which\r\nthe poison is so intense, or it acts with such frightful energy, that\r\ndeath occurs even within the first day. The patient is overpowered at\r\nthe outset of the disease by the virulence of the specific principle,\r\nperishing in coma, preceded perhaps by convulsions. The autopsy in\r\nsuch cases reveals hyperæmia of the brain and cranial sinuses, blood\r\nof a dark-red color, capillary hemorrhages in various parts, a flabby\r\nheart, and perhaps some engorgement of the spleen and kidneys.\r\n\r\nUsually, malignant scarlet fever exhibits its severe type from the\r\nfirst, but cases sometimes occur which seem mild and favorable for a\r\nfew days, when severe symptoms suddenly supervene. This change from a\r\nmild to a dangerous disease is, however, most frequently, I think, due\r\nto some complication.\r\n\r\nIRREGULAR FORMS.--Deviation from the normal type in scarlet fever is\r\nusually due to some perturbating cause, which is often a pre-existing\r\nor co-existing disease, or a disordered state of system through causes\r\ndistinct from the scarlatinous disease. Thus, a little girl in my\r\npractice had the symptoms of scarlet fever, such as febrile movement\r\nand inflammation of the buccal and faucial surfaces, nearly a week\r\nbefore the scarlatinous eruption appeared. During this time the\r\npatient had an intestinal catarrh, with diarrhoea, which declined when\r\nthe rash occurred. This intestinal disease was the apparent cause of\r\nthe irregularity in the malady. If scarlatina occur during a severe\r\nattack of entero-colitis attended by purging, the defluxion from the\r\nexternal surface may be such that no efflorescence appears. Severe\r\nscarlet fever itself sometimes appears to cause gastro-intestinal\r\ncatarrh so as to produce an afflux of blood toward the intestinal\r\ntract and away from the skin. Practitioners occasionally meet cases\r\nlike the following, which I recall to mind: In a family where\r\nscarlatina was prevailing a little child early after the commencement\r\nof symptoms which seemed to be plainly referable to this exanthem was\r\nseized with vomiting and purging, which continued till death {509}\r\noccurred on the third day. No efflorescence appeared upon the skin,\r\nbut the symptoms indicated the presence of severe intestinal catarrh,\r\ncomplicating and masking scarlatina. We are aided in the diagnosis of\r\nsuch cases by observing the faucial redness, and we may discover a\r\nfaint efflorescence upon parts of the surface, as about the groin or\r\nin the flexures of the joints. In another instance an infant in the\r\nwarm months having protracted entero-colitis, the usual summer\r\nepidemic of the cities, had the characteristic symptoms of scarlet\r\nfever, which was present in the family, but the diarrhoea continued\r\nand no rash appeared.\r\n\r\nIn one who is much reduced by an antecedent disease, as phthisis, or\r\nwho has a disease, chronic or acute, which produces a decided afflux\r\nof blood away from the surface and toward the interior of the body,\r\nthe eruption is commonly tardy in its appearance, indistinct, or\r\nwholly absent. Thus, severe inflammations of internal organs not\r\ninfrequently render scarlet fever irregular. On the other hand, some\r\nmaladies occurring in connection with this exanthem do not change its\r\nsymptoms, but themselves undergo modification. Pertussis may be cited\r\nas an example, the cough of which is sometimes modified by an\r\nintercurrent attack of scarlet fever, the symptoms of the latter\r\ndisease undergoing little change.\r\n\r\nScarlet fever may also be irregular without any apparent perturbating\r\ncause. In 1867 I attended a young lady whose previous health had been\r\ngood, and whose brother was sick at the time with scarlet fever. She\r\nhad considerable febrile movement, with severe pharyngitis, and,\r\nthough her surface was repeatedly examined, no efflorescence was seen.\r\nTwo weeks subsequently she was affected with severe nephritis,\r\nanasarca, effusion into at least one of the pleural cavities, oedema\r\nof the lungs, and probably hydro-pericardium, the case ending fatally.\r\nRilliet and Barthez state that a second attack of scarlet fever is\r\nmore apt to be irregular than the first. Probably this opinion is\r\ncorrect, especially if only a short time have elapsed between the two\r\nseizures. Still, as we have already stated, both seizures may be\r\ntypical, and the second more severe than the first.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to make a clear and positive diagnosis of\r\ncertain cases of irregular scarlet fever, in which cerebral,\r\npulmonary, or gastro-intestinal symptoms predominate, were it not for\r\nthe fact that they occur in connection with other cases of scarlet\r\nfever or are followed by sequelæ which evidently have a scarlatinous\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the eruption, if it be intense or if a certain condition\r\nof system be present in the patient, is accompanied by more or less\r\nextravasation of blood-corpuscles from the capillaries, so that the\r\nredness does not entirely disappear on pressure, usually in points. In\r\nrare instances certain of the exanthematic fevers present an extreme\r\nhemorrhagic character, so as to be beyond the reach of remedies, and\r\nof necessity speedily fatal. Hemorrhagic cases of this severe form are\r\nprobably more common in variola than in the other fevers, but I have\r\nmet a notable case in what was diagnosticated scarlatina. In June,\r\n1881, a man in his thirty-second year, whose previous health had not\r\nbeen good, though he had no defined ailment and had been able to\r\nfollow his occupation of harness-maker, suddenly became very ill, with\r\nhigh febrile movement and faucial inflammation, attended by marked\r\nprostration. After some hours an intense eruption of a scarlatinous\r\nappearance covered nearly the entire surface, and on the following day\r\nhemorrhages began to occur. The urine {510} contained a large\r\nproportion of blood; each conjunctiva was raised by hemorrhages\r\nunderneath (ecchymosis), so that its natural color was lost and the\r\neyelids closed with difficulty; and blood flowed from the nostrils,\r\ngums, and under the skin, forming hemorrhagic points and blotches. One\r\nof the consulting physicians, perceiving the resemblance to\r\nhemorrhagic variola as described by Hebra, suspected that we had a\r\ncase of this formidable malady to deal with, but the time for the\r\nappearance of the variolous eruption passed by without its occurrence.\r\nDeath took place on the fifth day. The temperature during the sickness\r\nwas high, though the record of it has been mislaid. Fortunately, such\r\nsevere hemorrhagic cases, which are necessarily fatal, are rare.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--Scarlet fever, if its type be severe, is\r\nin itself dangerous to life. Many, as we have seen, perish from its\r\ndirect effects when it produces profound blood-poisoning. But, while\r\nthe ordinary epidemics of this malady are necessarily attended by a\r\nlarge mortality from the virulence and depressing effect of the\r\nspecific principle, unfortunately, of all the diseases of modern\r\ntimes, scarlatina ranks first as regards the number and gravity of its\r\ncomplications and sequelæ, so that nearly or quite as many perish from\r\nthese as from the direct effect of the poison.\r\n\r\nNervous accidents occur chiefly at two periods--to wit, in the first\r\ndays, when they are due to the severity and malignancy of the malady\r\nand to the impressible nervous temperament of the child, and in the\r\ndeclining stage, or after the termination of the fever, when they\r\noccur from uræmia. If the type be malignant, delirium, jactitation,\r\nprofound stupor, and convulsions frequently occur on the first and\r\nsecond days; and they are symptoms which properly excite the utmost\r\nalarm and demand all the resources of our art, since they indicate a\r\nform of the disease which is apt to end in speedy death. The eyes have\r\na dull or wild expression, the conjunctiva is suffused, the heat of\r\nsurface pungent, the pulse rapid and compressible or feeble, rising\r\nabove 150, even to 200, per minute, and the temperature is always\r\nelevated to a degree that involves danger, the thermometer not\r\ninfrequently indicating 105° or 106°. But this severe form of scarlet\r\nfever, attended by so great elevation of temperature, is much less\r\ndangerous than in former times, even though it be complicated by\r\ndelirium and convulsions, since we no longer hesitate to reduce bodily\r\nheat, when excessive, by the free use of cold baths, and have\r\ndiscovered potent agents in the bromides and chloral for controlling\r\nconvulsions. Nevertheless, not a few perish in the commencement of\r\nscarlet fever with predominating cerebral symptoms, as delirium or\r\neclampsia, followed by coma, under the best possible treatment.\r\nSometimes the symptoms have closely simulated those of acute\r\nmeningitis, and if the rash have been delayed and the sore throat is\r\nas yet slight, the physician may suspect that he is dealing with this\r\ndisease; but autopsies in such cases show no inflammatory lesions, but\r\nonly congestion of the cerebral and meningeal vessels.\r\n\r\nAs is stated in a preceding page, in every case of normal scarlet\r\nfever inflammation of the faucial surface is present, as indicated by\r\nredness, tenderness, and increased secretion of mucus or muco-pus. It\r\nprecedes the efflorescence on the skin, and is announced by pain in\r\nswallowing and on pressure with the fingers behind and below the\r\nangles of the jaw. In that form of scarlet fever which has been\r\ndesignated anginose the {511} pharyngitis is severe, and is a\r\nprominent element in the malady, the uvula, the pillars of the fauces,\r\nand the faucial surface in general being infiltrated and swollen.\r\nNevertheless, this inflammation, with the accompanying tumefaction, is\r\nproperly a part of the disease, rather than a complication, if it\r\nabates with the subsidence of the scarlet fever or begin to abate soon\r\nafter, and if it produce but slight destructive change in the tissues\r\nof the neck. The secretions from the fauces may be foul and offensive;\r\neven superficial ulcerations or gangrene may occur upon the faucial\r\nsurface, causing it to present a dark brown or jagged appearance, and\r\nthe tissues of the neck may be infiltrated to a certain extent, and we\r\ndesignate the disease a form of scarlet fever under the title\r\nanginose. But when this condition is greatly aggravated, so that there\r\nis extensive infiltration and swelling of the tissues of the neck,\r\nwith an amount of ulceration or gangrene which in itself involves\r\ndanger, continuing after the primary disease abates, prolonging the\r\nfever and reducing the strength, it is proper to regard the state of\r\nthe throat as a complication. In addition to the pharyngitis, which is\r\nsevere as described above, the sides of the neck around the angles of\r\nthe jaw become swollen, hard, and tender. The inflammation has been\r\npropagated to the deeper structures of the neck. Poisonous substances,\r\nthe result of decomposition or vitiated secretions, traverse the\r\nlymphatic vessels from the faucial surface, and, being intercepted in\r\nthe lymphatic glands, cause adenitis, and the inflammation extends\r\nfrom the glands to the adjacent connective tissue, which becomes hard,\r\ntender, swollen, and infiltrated with inflammatory products. This\r\ntumefaction sometimes begins by the second or third day, but it is\r\nusually about the close of the first week or in the beginning of the\r\nsecond week that it becomes so considerable as to constitute a source\r\nof danger and anxiety. It is in most cases bilateral, though one side\r\nmay begin to swell before the other and remain larger throughout.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases of this complication the tumefaction extends from ear\r\nto ear, filling up the space below and around the angles of the jaw\r\nand under the chin. Not only is deglutition difficult, but it is\r\ndifficult to open the mouth sufficiently to inspect the fauces, and\r\nattempts to do so cause much pain. The lymphatic glands, which lie in\r\nthe inflamed area and participate in the inflammation, are greatly\r\nenlarged by hyperplasia, the round granular lymph-cells multiplying so\r\nabundantly that the glands increase to many times their normal size.\r\nMost of the tumefaction is, however, due to extension of the\r\ninflammation to the connective tissue of the neck. The cellulitis,\r\nwhich resembles that occurring in other conditions, is attended by\r\ndistension of the capillaries, the abundant formation of young round\r\ncells, and transudation of serum (Billroth). A moderate amount of\r\ntumefaction may disappear by resolution, but if it be considerable it\r\nseldom abates in this way, but by the tedious and exhausting process\r\nof suppuration or gangrene. If the swelling at its most prominent\r\npoint present a reddish hue, all hope of producing resolution must be\r\nabandoned; it cannot be effected by any medicine or appliance within\r\nthe resources of our art. The abscess which forms is apt to be\r\ndiffuse, so as to involve danger of pyæmia, unless it be soon opened\r\nand properly washed out. With the discharge of the pus the swelling\r\ngradually softens and declines. In other cases gangrene results. The\r\nvessels in the inflamed part are compressed by the inflammatory\r\nproducts, so that {512} they no longer convey the blood which is\r\nrequired for the purpose of nutrition. It is a law of the economy that\r\nwhenever the circulation ceases, the tissues which receive their\r\nnutritive supply through the obstructed vessels lose their vitality.\r\nHence gangrene occurs in all that portion of the swelling in which the\r\ncirculation is arrested. The skin over it peels off, the dead tissue\r\nunderneath is brown or dark, and soon, if life be prolonged, the\r\nslough begins to separate. The prognosis as regards this complication\r\ndepends largely on the size of the slough. If it be large, death will\r\nprobably result, since the strength of the system is already reduced\r\nby the primary disease, and the reparative process will necessarily be\r\nslow, while abundant suppuration tends to increase the exhaustion. In\r\nsome of the worst cases of cervical gangrene which I have seen the\r\nslough has laid bare the muscles and vessels of the neck, producing in\r\none case a cavity or excavation sufficiently large to admit a hen's\r\negg. Often the slough extends under the skin, so that the deepest\r\nrecesses of the cavity are not visible, and occasionally in cases\r\nwhich have ended fatally in my practice severe hemorrhage occurred\r\nfrom the concealed vessels. If the ulcerative or gangrenous process\r\nextends so deeply into the tissues of the neck that hemorrhages occur,\r\ndeath is the common result; but if the destructive action be of\r\nmoderate extent and other conditions favorable, we may expect recovery\r\nthrough cicatrization, with perhaps some deformity by contraction of\r\nthe cicatrix.\r\n\r\nWhen the inflammation of the connective tissue of the neck is\r\nextensive, involving both the lateral and anterior regions of the\r\nneck, the patient is in a perilous state. The cellulitis, when\r\nextensive and accompanied by much swelling, may produce oedema of the\r\nglottis, may obstruct respiration by compressing the air-passages or\r\nthe laryngeal nerves, may cause compression of the jugular veins, and\r\nthus give rise to dangerous cerebral symptoms, or may lay bare and\r\ninjure important muscles and nerves, as we have seen. If the\r\nulceration or gangrene be extensive, and death do not occur by\r\nhemorrhage from arterial or venous twigs, septic poisoning may occur,\r\nincreasing still more the fatal nature of the malady.\r\n\r\nSome cases of this complication are melancholy in the extreme, as one\r\nrelated by Cremen, in which ulceration of the pharynx occurred,\r\nallowing the escape of food and preventing deglutition. In severe\r\nscarlatinous pharyngitis the inflammation is apt to extend along the\r\nEustachian tube, causing its occlusion. This accident will be\r\nconsidered when we treat of otitis media, another grave complication.\r\nIt often also extends into the nares, causing catarrh of the\r\nSchneiderian mucous membrane, with discharge of muco-pus from this\r\nsurface. Not infrequently ulceration or gangrene occurs in the faucial\r\nsurface, producing more or less destruction of tissue and forming\r\nexcavations which connect with the throat, while the cutaneous surface\r\nretains its integrity and is not even reddened. The following case\r\nshows how grave the complication which we are now considering\r\nsometimes is when the external surface of the neck is not involved,\r\nand how the inflammation by extension outward from the fauces may\r\ninvolve the middle ear.\r\n\r\n_Case 1._--Annie K----, aged two and a half years, an inmate of the\r\nNew York Foundling Asylum, was well, except an eczema of the scalp,\r\nuntil the night of April 3, 1882, when she was attacked with vomiting\r\nand {513} diarrhoea. She was feverish and drowsy, and at 2 P.M. on the\r\n4th the scarlatinous efflorescence appeared upon her neck, body, and\r\nlower extremities; tongue coated; pharynx red; temperature (axillary)\r\n103°; pulse 160. The symptoms and aspect indicated a grave form of the\r\nmalady, and the usual sustaining treatment was ordered. On April 5th\r\nthe temperature was 102°, pulse 144, tongue less coated, eruption\r\nfading, less stupor, no albumen in urine. April 6th, morning\r\ntemperature 102°, pulse 160; passed a restless night; stools thin and\r\ntoo frequent; has grayish patches in the throat: P.M. temperature\r\n103-1/5°, pulse 150. April 7th, the diarrhoea continues, and she has a\r\ncopious muco-purulent discharge from the nostrils; P.M. temperature\r\n103-3/5°, pulse 160. April 10th, the temperature has continued at\r\nabout 103°; the patient is very sick, with a constant foul-smelling\r\ndischarge from the nostrils; breath very offensive; temperature\r\n103.5°, pulse about 180. April 12th, general appearance a little\r\nbetter, but the posterior surface of the fauces is completely covered\r\nby a thick pseudo-membrane; had four loose stools last night;\r\ntemperature and pulse the same as at last record; a dark, offensive,\r\nand jagged coating over the fauces, and a dark, foul discharge from\r\nthe nostrils, as before; examination of the chest negative. April\r\n14th, is much prostrated; temperature 104.5°, pulse rapid and weak;\r\nrespiration noisy, diminished resonance over lower two-thirds of left\r\nside of chest; ulcers upon the mouth and tongue; fauces red and\r\nulcerated. April 17th, pulse 150, temperature 100.5°; general\r\nappearance somewhat better, but the diarrhoea continues, and patches\r\nof a diphtheritic character have appeared upon the lips; moist râles\r\nin left side of chest. The symptoms continued nearly the same until\r\nApril 23d, when she died. A dull percussion sound and distinct\r\nbronchial respiration were observed in the left scapular region during\r\nthe last days of her life.\r\n\r\nAutopsy nine hours after death by the curator, Dr. W. P. Northrup:\r\nBody well nourished; the tissues have a jaundiced hue; lips sore; on\r\nturning the head to one side pus runs from the left ear and dirty\r\nmuco-pus from the mouth. Brain normal; on opening the petrous portion\r\nof the left temporal bone the middle ear is found full of pus, which\r\ncommunicated freely with the external ear through a perforated\r\nmembrana tympani; the Eustachian tube cannot be traced in the sloughy\r\ntissue, and a passage filled with pus extends from the ear to the\r\nfauces; opposite the greater cornua of the hyoid bone are two deep\r\nulcers, each having about the diameter of a ten-cent piece, with\r\nsloughy and offensive base and sides; the left ulcer communicates by a\r\nragged and wide sinus with a dark and sloughy cavity of about four\r\ndrachms capacity; this cavity is located in the neck under the angle\r\nof the jaw, apparently occupying the site of a disintegrated gland,\r\nand it opens upon the surface of the fauces. The surface of the larynx\r\nhas a dusky, dirty appearance, sprinkled with little cheesy-looking\r\nspots, and covered by a dirty, foul-appearing liquid, as if some of\r\nthe ichorous pus had escaped into it from the neck; about one and a\r\nhalf inches below the vocal chords there is an unmistakable\r\npseudo-membrane; below this, near the bifurcation, the trachea has a\r\nbright-red color, as if a pseudo-membrane had been peeled from it,\r\nleaving the surface raw. The detachment of a pseudo-membrane from this\r\npart, if it did occur, must have been ante-mortem, for the organ had\r\nbeen carefully handled {514} in making the autopsy. Between the apex\r\nof the left lung and the median line the tissues of the neck,\r\ndissected upward, are found indurated, yellow, and giving an offensive\r\nodor, showing that the cervical cellulitis had extended downward\r\nfarther than usual. The bronchial glands have undergone hyperplasia,\r\nbeing enlarged and hard. The right lung is normal; about one-half of\r\nthe left lower lobe is consolidated, and when cut is found to be\r\ngangrenous and offensive. The liver is apparently somewhat enlarged;\r\nspleen normal in size; gastric mucous membrane has a congested\r\nappearance and is covered with mucus; mesenteric glands enlarged,\r\npale, and firm; Peyer's patches swollen and pale; at lower end of\r\nileum some pigmentation of these glands; in large intestine the\r\nsolitary glands are enlarged, and a few of them pigmented; kidneys\r\npale, cortex thickened, and markings indistinct. Microscopical\r\nExamination.--In the pia mater perhaps a little increase of cells;\r\nmeninges of brain otherwise normal. The trachea shows well-marked\r\ndiphtheritic inflammation; it contains a film of pseudo-membrane;\r\nevidences of inflammation occur also upon the laryngeal surface,\r\nthough less marked than in the trachea. The solidified portion of the\r\nlung exhibits the ordinary lesions of broncho-pneumonia, with some\r\ninterstitial change. In the kidneys we find parenchymatous nephritis,\r\nwith some cell-growth in the Malpighian bodies.\r\n\r\nThe above case has been related at length, not only because it shows\r\nhow severe and destructive the inflammation of the throat, extending\r\ninto the tissues of the neck, sometimes is, but because four other\r\ncomplications or sequelæ were also present--to wit, otitis media,\r\ndiphtheria, nephritis, and pneumonia. We see from the above case how\r\nformidable a disease scarlet fever sometimes is when attended by the\r\ninflammations to which it so frequently gives rise, for a child older\r\nand stronger than this, if thus affected, would necessarily have\r\nperished with the best possible treatment.\r\n\r\nIn localities where diphtheria is endemic, as in New York City and\r\nParis, scarlet fever is often complicated by a pseudo-membranous\r\ninflammation of the fauces and air-passages. In severe cases of\r\nscarlet fever the Schneiderian as well as the faucial surface is\r\ncovered with it, so that it can be readily seen on inspecting the\r\nanterior nares. Occasionally, the pseudo-membrane appears upon the\r\nlaryngeal and tracheal surfaces, as in the case which I have related\r\nabove and in others presently to be related, causing dangerous\r\nembarrassment of respiration. This complication sometimes begins\r\nalmost at the commencement of scarlet fever, but in most instances it\r\ndoes not occur before the third or fourth day, and it sometimes does\r\nnot appear till in the declining stage of the fever. When it begins,\r\nit intensifies the febrile movement and produces general aggravation\r\nof symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe common opinion is, that whenever a pseudo-membrane occurs upon the\r\ninflamed mucous surface in scarlatina true diphtheria has supervened;\r\nbut there are those who hold that scarlet fever itself, when the\r\ninflammations which attend it are severe, may give rise to\r\npseudo-membranes, so that what seems to be diphtheritic is but an\r\nelement in the primary disease. My convictions are strong that when\r\npseudo-membranes occur on any of the inflamed mucous surfaces in\r\nscarlet fever, true diphtheria has, with few exceptions, supervened if\r\nthe patient live in a {515} locality where diphtheria is prevalent.\r\nThat scarlet fever may occur in an individual along with another acute\r\ninfectious malady is shown by abundant cases. It often occurs with\r\nvaricella, and J. Herzog relates the following case, in which measles\r\nand scarlet fever coexisted:[2] A boy aged eight years had measles,\r\nwith the usual catarrhal symptoms, and on the fourth day, as the\r\ntemperature was returning to the normal, it rose again suddenly, and\r\nthe scarlatinal rash and sore throat appeared. In due time these\r\nsubsided, and desquamation occurred. I have seen a similar case in\r\nconsultation during the current year, so that there is nothing\r\nimprobable in the theory that scarlet fever may coexist with other\r\ninfectious maladies; and it is admitted that diphtheria, like\r\nerysipelas, may complicate the most diverse constitutional diseases.\r\nMoreover, when a child with pertussis, measles, typhoid fever, or\r\ntuberculosis suddenly develops a high fever with the occurrence of a\r\npseudo-membranous inflammation upon the fauces or air-passages, all\r\nadmit that diphtheria has supervened, since such inflammation is not\r\nan element in any form or type of either of these diseases; and I see\r\nno reason in the nature of the disease why scarlet fever should not be\r\nequally liable to this complication.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Berl klin. Woch._, 1882, No. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe elaborate treatise by Sanné of Paris on diphtheria contains a\r\nchapter entitled \"Secondary Diphtheria.\" In it the author says, what\r\nall who are familiar with diphtheria will agree to, that secondary\r\ndiphtheria does not differ in nature from the primary form, and that\r\nit exhibits a tendency \"to occupy the organs which are themselves the\r\nseat of the more pronounced local determinations of the primitive\r\nmalady.... Diphtheria is seen in the course or sequel of numerous\r\ndiseases. Some appear to have a special proclivity for engendering\r\ndiphtheria; these are specific maladies: measles, scarlet fever,\r\npertussis.\" I have tabulated as follows Sanné's statistics of\r\nsecondary diphtheria:\r\n\r\n                                        Cases  Deaths  Cures  Doubtful\r\n                                        -----  ------  -----  --------\r\n  Diphtheria complicating measles,       100     83     15       2\r\n      \"            \"      scarlet fever,  43     22     17       4\r\n      \"            \"      pertussis,      20     12      6       2\r\n      \"            \"      typhoid fever,   8      8\r\n      \"            \"      tuberculosis,   19     19\r\n\r\nSanné's statistics relating to the seat of scarlatinous diphtheria are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Fauces alone                       attacked, 15 cases.\r\n    \"    with larynx                    \"       4   \"\r\n    \"     \"   nasal fossa               \"       8   \"\r\n    \"     \"   larynx and nasal fossa    \"       4   \"\r\n    \"     \"   larynx and bronchi        \"       1   \"\r\n    \"     \"   nasal fossa and lips      \"       1   \"\r\n    \"     \"   lips and skin             \"       1   \"\r\n    \"    unaffected,                            3   \"\r\n  Diphtheria generalized,                       2   \"\r\n  Larynx only affected,                         2   \"\r\n  Nasal fossa    \"                              1   \"\r\n\r\nThe opinion of so good an observer as Sanné, that when in scarlet\r\nfever, pseudo-membranous exudation appears upon the mucous surfaces\r\nwhich are the seat of scarlatinous inflammation, diphtheria has\r\nsupervened, and not a croupous form of scarlatinous phlegmasia,\r\ncarries with it great {516} weight. That it was diphtheria in four\r\ninstances in my practice I had sufficient proof, for this disease\r\nbecame dissociated from scarlet fever, and extended to other members\r\nof these families as idiopathic diphtheria.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one of the most difficult problems which we have to deal\r\nwith in certain cases is to distinguish diphtheritic from\r\nnon-diphtheritic inflammation; and I see no reason why the\r\nscarlatinous inflammation when intense may not be sometimes\r\nmembranous; and those no doubt err who ignore this, and consider every\r\ninflammation attended by a pellicular exudation diphtheritic. We know\r\nthat in some cases of dysentery a fibrinous exudation occurs upon the\r\nsurface of the colon; that in croupous pneumonia fibrin exudes into\r\nthe bronchioles and alveoli of the lungs; and that physicians in\r\nlocalities where there is no diphtheria meet, though at long\r\nintervals, cases which they designate croupous pharyngitis and\r\nlaryngitis; and it seems to me that the intense inflammation of\r\nanginose scarlatina probably sometimes produces the same exudation.\r\nMoreover, it is very difficult to distinguish in the swollen fauces\r\nbetween a membranous exudation and ulceration or superficial gangrene\r\nso common in malignant scarlet fever. The grayish-white surface,\r\njagged and foul, may be the one or the other, an exudation or a\r\nsphacelus, and in certain instances it is impossible to discriminate\r\nbetween the two conditions at the bedside.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria complicating scarlet fever sometimes begins nearly\r\nsimultaneously with the latter. Henoch states that exceptionally he\r\nhas observed suspicious patches upon the fauces before the appearance\r\nof the scarlatinous eruption upon the skin; and he adds: \"I have had\r\nrepeated opportunities of observing this unusual beginning. In such\r\ncases we must ask ourselves whether the first affection was really\r\nconnected with the second, or whether the former was a true primary\r\ndiphtheria, rapidly followed by scarlatina. This opinion is favored by\r\nthe fact that I have only observed such cases in the hospital, in\r\nwhich infection with various forms of contagion can scarcely be\r\navoided.\"\r\n\r\nBut usually it is not till the third or fourth day of scarlet fever\r\nthat this complication begins. The patient has been progressing\r\nfavorably with the scarlet fever, till on a certain day a marked\r\naggravation of symptoms occurs. A higher temperature, more pungent\r\nheat, and the physiognomy of a more serious malady are present. On\r\ninspecting the fauces to discover the cause we observe a pellicle\r\nforming over the tonsils and perhaps other portions of the faucial\r\nsurface. Often the entire aspect of the case changes by the occurrence\r\nof this complication, a mild case of scarlet fever becoming grave and\r\nfatal in consequence. Thus in a case which I saw with Dr. Hardy of New\r\nYork the membranous inflammation of diphtheria, commencing upon the\r\nfauces on the third day of scarlet fever, extended to the Schneiderian\r\nmembrane, and thence along the left lachrymal sac to the eyelids,\r\nproducing redness and swelling along the side of the nose and upon the\r\ncheek like that of erysipelas. A thick diphtheritic pellicle occurred\r\nupon the under surface of each eyelid on the left side, with great\r\ntumefaction of both lids, gangrene of the cornea, and destruction of\r\nthe eye. The case soon ended fatally.\r\n\r\nThe diphtheritic inflammation sometimes extends to the larynx and\r\ntrachea, producing hoarseness and more or less obstruction to {517}\r\nrespiration. A thin film or flakes of fibrinous exudation, rendering\r\nthe respiration noisy, developed on the laryngeal or tracheal surface,\r\nis, I think, not infrequent in diphtheria complicating scarlet fever,\r\nbut the rapid development of a thick and firm pseudo-membrane, so as\r\nto imperil the life of the patient from the stenosis in the\r\nair-passages, has been much less frequent in my practice than it is in\r\nprimary diphtheria and in diphtheria complicating measles or\r\npertussis. The following were cases of this severe complication\r\noccurring in a recent epidemic in the New York Foundling Asylum. In\r\nthese cases the respiration was noisy, but the obstruction to\r\nbreathing seemed to be due to infiltration and swelling around the\r\naperture of the glottis, rather than to diphtheritic croup, which the\r\nautopsies showed to be present.\r\n\r\n_Case 2._--A child aged three and a half years, who previously had\r\nsymptoms of mild catarrhal croup, with moderate redness of the fauces,\r\nsickened with scarlet fever on Oct. 1, 1882, the rash being profuse\r\nand soon covering nearly the entire body. The axillary temperature was\r\n103°, pulse 140; slight stridor in breathing and some cough; fauces\r\nvery red, but free from membrane. Oct. 2d, restless, sleeping but\r\nlittle; has vomited four times. Oct. 3d, temp. 103.5°, pulse 120;\r\nfauces much swollen; still vomiting; rash abundant. 4 P.M., temp.\r\n104.3°, pulse 128; tongue clean; some discharge from nares; urine not\r\nalbuminous, but its quantity diminished. Oct. 4th, aspect that of very\r\nsevere sickness; profuse discharge from nostrils; fauces of a deep red\r\ncolor, and a diphtheritic pellicle over tonsils and uvula; tumefaction\r\nalong the sides of the neck; temp. 104°, pulse 140; breathing\r\nmoderately stridulous; urine is passed more freely than yesterday;\r\nevening temp. 105°. Oct. 6th, croupy symptoms more marked; tonsils and\r\nuvula greatly swollen, so that the fauces are almost occluded; temp.\r\n103.5°; breathing difficult, but apparently sufficient oxygen is\r\nreceived; profuse nasal discharge, and other symptoms as before. About\r\n1.30 P.M. he was raised to take some milk, and suddenly became\r\nasphyxiated. His face was dusky, his eyes protruded, and he voided\r\nurine and feces. Dr. Swift, who attended the child, and to whom I am\r\nindebted for this history, immediately performed tracheotomy, which\r\ngave temporary relief by the expulsion of a considerable quantity of\r\npseudo-membrane through the opening. On the following day the\r\nrespiration again became obstructed at some point below the canula, so\r\nthat it could not be removed; the features grew livid, and death\r\noccurred in convulsions twenty-six hours after the tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy was made by Dr. W. P. Northrup, curator of the asylum, who\r\nfound the pharynx covered by a membrane which was traced to the\r\nposterior nares; larynx, trachea, and bronchial tubes as far as the\r\nthird divisions also covered with membrane; portions of the tracheal\r\nsurface denuded, and the mucous membrane underneath of a bright red\r\ncolor and smooth; tonsils sloughy and fetid; mucous membrane of\r\nsmaller bronchial tubes very red and covered with viscid mucus and\r\npus; a portion of the left lung, extending from the root posteriorly\r\nto the surface, gangrenous, discolored, and honeycombed; two or three\r\nintensely hyperæmic spots, as large as a bean, in left lung; right\r\nlung congested, but not consolidated; slight catarrh of stomach;\r\ncircumscribed areas of congestion in intestines; solitary glands of\r\nintestines swollen, and some {518} of them ulcerated; spleen of normal\r\nsize, rather pale; liver congested and somewhat enlarged.\r\n\r\n_Case 3._--Katie, aged six and a third years, was returned to the\r\nasylum on Nov. 18th. Three days later (Nov. 21st) she had sore throat,\r\nreddened fauces, coated tongue, and a faint rash upon the neck, chest,\r\nand arms; eyes injected; temperature 102°. In the afternoon\r\ntemperature 103°; eruption still faint. Nov. 22d, temperature 103.5°;\r\nan eruption on chest, abdomen, arms, and legs in patches. Evening,\r\ntemperature 104°; voice clear. Nov. 23d, temperature 103.5°; tongue\r\nred; fauces deeply reddened, but without any visible pseudo-membrane;\r\neruption of a scarlatinous appearance over the back and abdomen; on\r\nthe extremities dusky, livid patches. P.M., temperature 104°; is\r\nslightly delirious; eruption abundant. Nov. 24th, temperature 103.5°;\r\neruption well out on abdomen; it is the same as yesterday upon the\r\nextremities, except perhaps a little more dusky; still no\r\npseudo-membrane to be seen upon the fauces; is restless and delirious.\r\nP.M., during the day has been very restless, suffering from dyspnoea;\r\nno croupy voice nor croupy cough, though the dyspnoea continues, and a\r\npseudo-membrane is now visible over the tonsils and adjacent faucial\r\nsurface; eruption dusky; skin cool; pulse very frequent and feeble.\r\nFrom this time she sank steadily, and died at 11.30 P.M. During her\r\nsickness her urine seemed to be diminished, but it was not properly\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nAutopsy Nov. 25th by Dr. W. P. Northrup, curator: Points of redness,\r\napparently a hemorrhagic eruption, over the face, shoulders, and parts\r\nof the trunk; a few of the same on the extremities; no pseudo-membrane\r\nvisible in nostrils or in buccal cavity; brain not examined.\r\nNaso-pharynx covered by a thick fibro-purulent membrane. Larynx\r\ncontains a well-marked pseudo-membrane, but not continuous. Trachea\r\ncovered by a pseudo-membrane, continuous over most of its surface, but\r\nin places broken and flaky. Where it is detached the mucous membrane\r\nis seen underneath, dusky and deeply injected. At the root of the\r\nlungs the pseudo-membrane can be traced along the tubes about an inch\r\nin all directions. Lungs oedematous, with deep congestion in places,\r\nbut apparently no pneumonia; about two drachms of clear, straw-colored\r\nfluid in pericardium; a few stringy decolorized clots in the cavities\r\nof the heart; left ventricle contracted. The heart-fibres, carefully\r\nexamined, microscopically, in the laboratory, are found to be normal,\r\nnot having undergone granular or fatty degeneration. Liver normal in\r\nsize; pale-yellow areas upon the superior surface, either from anæmia\r\nor fatty deposition. Kidneys of usual size, capsule not adherent;\r\npyramids congested; cortex pale; markings distinct. Spleen enlarged\r\nabout one-third; consistence normal. Stomach and intestines not\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n_Case 4._--Scarlet fever complicated by diphtheria, nephritis, and\r\nbroncho-pneumonia. (History by house physician, Dr. Swift.) Phoebe,\r\naged three and a quarter years, was delicate, but in her usual health\r\ntill Oct. 29, 1882, when she became languid and vomited several times,\r\nand her tongue was coated. Oct. 30th, occasional vomiting; fauces\r\nreddened; tongue coated. Oct. 31st, remains languid; fauces deeply\r\nreddened; a faint scarlatinous eruption over back, wrists, and feet;\r\ntemperature 100.5°. P.M., eruption of scarlet fever well out over the\r\nsurface; tongue cleaner. Nov. 1st, {519} rash over entire body;\r\ntemperature 100.2°. Nov. 2d, fauces deep-red; tonsils and uvula\r\nswollen; diarrhoea and vomiting. Nov. 3d, temperature 102.5°; the\r\neruption, which has been bright red, is now more dusky. Nov. 5th,\r\ntemperature 104.5°; dusky-red color of the eruption; skin beginning to\r\ndesquamate in places; urine normal; a discharge from nostrils. Nov.\r\n6th, temperature 103.5°; eruption still present, but skin of abdomen\r\nand back desquamating; has otorrhoea on both sides; fauces deeply\r\nhyperæmic, but no pseudo-membrane visible upon them. Nov. 7th,\r\ntemperature 103°; respiration and cough have a slight croupy\r\ncharacter; other symptoms as yesterday. Nov. 8th, temperature 101°. A\r\ncareful inspection of the fauces shows that it contains no\r\npseudo-membrane; nostrils discharging a dark-brownish liquid;\r\nexamination of urine negative. Nov. 11th, eruption, which appears to\r\nhave been hemorrhagic in points, is fading and the desquamation is\r\nless. Nov. 14th, nostrils still discharging; glands of neck swollen.\r\nNov. 16th, temperature 103°; sp. gr. of urine 1010, no casts, nor\r\nalbumen; the chest seems clear; less discharge from nostrils; fauces\r\nclean and but slightly inflamed. Nov. 17th, 18th, temperature 103.5°;\r\nvomits; lungs healthy, but breathes with considerable effort, though\r\nwithout stridor; urine diminished; its sp. gr. 1020, albuminous,\r\ncontains blood-corpuscles and granular casts. Nov. 19th, is very\r\npallid; temperature 104°; very restless; vomits; urine diminished;\r\nbowels freely open. Nov. 20th, respiration still embarrassed;\r\nsubcrepitant râles over the entire chest and percussion resonance not\r\nclear; temperature 102.5°. Nov. 21st, physical signs the same;\r\ntemperature 103.5°; respiration 80. Nov. 22d, urgent dyspnoea; dulness\r\non percussion over top of right lung and over lower part of left lung;\r\nis delirious; no perspiration; urine scanty; bowels freely open. From\r\nthis date the dyspnoea became more urgent, and death occurred at 4\r\nP.M. on the 23d.\r\n\r\nAutopsy by Dr. W. P. Northrup, curator: Body well nourished; slight\r\noedema of both legs; swelling at angles of jaws, most marked on left\r\nside. Vessels of brain moderately injected; otherwise appearance\r\nnormal. Cicatrizing ulcers on both sides of fauces; a diphtheritic\r\npseudo-membrane on septum of nose, larynx normal. Trachea, upper half\r\napparently normal; a thin film of pseudo-membrane extends from just\r\nabove the bifurcation upward to nearly the middle of trachea. About an\r\nounce of fluid in each pleural cavity; on the right side a few loose\r\nflakes of fibrin floating in the serum, and consolidation of lung at\r\napex; collapse in one or two places. Left side, recent adhesions over\r\nwhole of posterior surface and base; surface of lower lobe dark, and\r\nwhen it is detached strings of fibrin adhere to it, and it is\r\nconsolidated. The cut surface shows marked oedema, injection, increase\r\nof mucus in bronchi, and disseminated miliary tubercles in every part;\r\nno tubercles in the pleura, and none elsewhere in the body except in\r\nthe left lung; tubercles in the lower lobe larger and more thickly\r\ngrouped than in the upper lobe. Decolorized clots in heart, extending\r\nfrom ventricles into auricles of both sides. The capacity of the\r\nventricles seems normal. Liver and spleen, normal. Kidneys rather\r\nlarge; capsules not adherent; superficial veins injected. The cut\r\nsurface shows congested pyramids and pale cortex; markings indistinct\r\nand irregular; about four ounces of clear straw-colored fluid in\r\nabdominal cavity, and the solitary follicles of {520} large intestines\r\nshow pigmentation; two simple intussusceptions, each three-fourths\r\ninch in length, in small intestines.\r\n\r\nCoryza frequently commences at or about the time of the pharyngitis.\r\nThe inflammation of the Schneiderian membrane is continuous\r\nposteriorly with that of the fauces, and is announced by redness and\r\nswelling, inability to breathe freely through the nostrils, and an\r\nirritating ichorous discharge. Simple coryza in itself involves little\r\ndanger, though it is an unpleasant complication, and in the nursing\r\ninfant it may interfere with sucking. Diphtheritic coryza, on the\r\nother hand, which is frequently present when diphtheria complicates\r\nscarlet fever, involves danger, since it is apt to cause ulcerations,\r\nhemorrhages, and septic poisoning. When the local symptoms are\r\nunusually severe and the discharge abundant, it is probable that\r\ninflammation has in some cases extended to the antrum of Highmore.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the middle ear is another unpleasant and not\r\ninfrequent complication. It is attributed to extension of the catarrh\r\nfrom the pharynx along the Eustachian tube to the tympanum. In a\r\nconsiderable proportion of cases of otitis media this tube is occluded\r\nby the infiltration and swelling of its mucous membrane, so that the\r\nmuco-pus escapes with difficulty or is retained. Hence severe earache,\r\nan increase of the febrile movement, and outward bulging of the\r\nmembrana tympani occur. Sometimes headache or other cerebral symptoms\r\narise, probably from the fact that the meningeal artery, which\r\nsupplies the meninges, is connected by anastomosing branches with the\r\ntympanum. In one of the cases related above it will be recollected\r\nthat the ulceration and abscess extended from the fauces to the middle\r\near, the entire Eustachian tube having disappeared in the ulcerative\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nFrequently, the otitis escapes detection, its symptoms being masked or\r\nobscured by the general disease, until the membrana tympani is\r\nperforated and otorrhoea begins; but by careful examination the nature\r\nof the complication can usually be ascertained before the ear is\r\ninjured to this extent, for a patient too young to speak will often\r\npress with the fingers against the painful ear or lie with the ear\r\npressed upon the pillow, evidently having an increase of suffering if\r\nplaced in any other position. One old enough to speak and in proper\r\nmental condition makes known the earache as soon as it occurs.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the tympanum, red and swollen from\r\ninflammation, secretes muco-pus abundantly; and this, pent up in the\r\ncavity, must obtain an exit before relief occurs. It is well if this\r\nsecretion escape, though with difficulty, down the Eustachian tube.\r\nThe destructive action of the pus upon the delicate structure of the\r\near is often such that, within a few days, irreparable harm is done\r\nand more or less deafness results. Relief can occur, if the Eustachian\r\ntube remain closed, only by perforation of the membrane and the\r\ndischarge of the secretions into the external meatus. When this occurs\r\nthe inflammation in the most favorable cases gradually abates, the\r\naperture in the drum closes, and the integrity of the auditory\r\napparatus is preserved. In severe cases the mastoid cells\r\nparticipating in the inflammation become filled with muco-pus and\r\ntender to the touch, and often the collateral oedema causes\r\ntumefaction and narrowing of the external ear, which subside with the\r\ndischarge of pus from the tympanum.\r\n\r\n{521} Unfortunately, there is for many a more melancholy history--a\r\nmore destructive inflammation, involving permanent impairment or total\r\nloss of hearing. This is especially apt to occur in strumous and\r\nfeeble children. All grades of inflammation and destructive action\r\noccur in different cases. The perforation in the drum-membrane may be\r\nlarge or the membrane may be completely destroyed, and the detached\r\nossicles escape one by one into the external meatus, and in a few\r\ninstances, fortunately rare, this occurs in both ears, producing\r\ncomplete and permanent deafness. In my own practice this has never\r\noccurred, but I have met one or two adults who were totally deaf from\r\nthis cause.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane which lines the bony wall of the middle ear has\r\nthe function of the periosteum, and therefore, when inflamed and\r\nsubjected to pressure, is liable to ulcerate. As in other parts of the\r\nskeleton under similar conditions, superficial caries or necrosis of\r\nthe underlying bone is apt to occur. The carious or necrotic process\r\nmay extend to the mastoid cells. An offensive otorrhoea, continuing\r\nfor months or years, indicates the persistence of this pathological\r\nstate of the tympanum, which is rendered so obstinate by the presence\r\nof dead bone. A moment's survey of the anatomical relations of the\r\nmiddle ear shows the danger to which these patients are liable. A thin\r\nbony septum, perforated with blood-vessels and sometimes containing\r\ncongenital apertures, separates the tympanum from the cranial cavity\r\nabove. Posteriorly lie the mastoid cells, connected with the tympanum\r\nby one large and several small apertures. Anteriorly is the\r\ncommencement of the Eustachian tube and in close proximity to the\r\ntympanum lies the carotid canal, and at one point also the superior\r\npetrosal sinus. Virchow has shown how inflammation extending from the\r\near in otitis media sometimes produces such compression of the veins\r\nor sinuses by the swelling from the infiltration and exudation that\r\nthe circulation is arrested, and the fibrin contained in the blood of\r\nthese vessels is precipitated, forming thrombi, with the most\r\ndisastrous effect upon the individual. Pus may also burrow in the\r\ninterstices of the bone, causing great pain, or the pent-up\r\nsecretions, having no outlet for escape, may in time undergo caseous\r\ndegeneration, producing the conditions in which tuberculosis so often\r\noriginates.\r\n\r\nDeath not infrequently occurs in chronic otitis media in another way.\r\nThe otorrhoea, after months or years, suddenly ceases, the child\r\ncomplains of constant severe headache and is feverish, and the case\r\nends in coma, preceded perhaps by convulsions. Meningitis has\r\noccurred, produced by extension of the inflammation through the thin\r\nbony septum which divides the tympanum from the cranial cavity, and at\r\nthe autopsy hyperæmia of the meninges, fibrin, pus, perhaps softening\r\nof the brain and an abscess, are formed in the portion of the\r\nencephalon adjacent to the tympanum. Therefore, otitis media, though\r\nit often ends favorably, is in many patients an obstinate, dangerous,\r\nand even fatal sequel of scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nThe complication known as scarlatinous rheumatism is regarded by some\r\nas a synovitis, but its symptoms, especially its shifting from joint\r\nto joint, seem to ally it to the rheumatic affections. In some\r\nepidemics it is common. It usually begins toward the close of the\r\nfirst week or in the second week, and its common seat is in the ankle,\r\nphalangeal, and wrist joints. It is attended by very little swelling\r\nin {522} most patients, though the joints are tender and painful on\r\npressure. It does not seem to retard convalescence materially, though\r\nit produces suffering and involves danger as regards the heart. It\r\nsubsides in a few days with the ordinary treatment of acute\r\nrheumatism, and even without special treatment, the chief danger being\r\nthat, as in idiopathic rheumatism, endocarditis may arise, with\r\npermanent crippling of the valves. The following was a case of\r\nvalvular disease having this origin. It occurred in my practice.\r\n\r\n_Case 5._--Freddy M., aged four years, sickened with scarlet fever\r\nMarch 6, 1879. The usual vomiting occurred on the first day, and the\r\ntemperature was 104°. The case progressed favorably till March 14th,\r\nwhen he complained of pain in both wrists, both ankles, and both\r\nknees. On March 17th the general condition was good, the urine\r\ncontained no albumen, and apparently few urates, but he still had pain\r\nin the joints of the upper and lower extremities and in the back;\r\npulse 140, temp. 103°; breathes with a slight moan; urates in the\r\nurine, but no albumen. A distinct mitral regurgitant murmur is now\r\nheard for the first time. Under the use of salicylate of sodium the\r\npain in the joints soon ceased, but the mitral murmur is permanent.\r\n\r\nThe following prescription is for a child of five years:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Ol. Gaultheriæ   fl. drachm iss;\r\n      Sodii Salicylat. drachm iii;\r\n      Syrupi           fl. oz. ii;\r\n      Aquæ             fl. oz. iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. Give one teaspoonful every four hours.\r\n\r\nOf the serous inflammations occurring in scarlet fever, pericarditis\r\nhas been, according to Rilliet and Barthez, most frequently observed.\r\nIn this country it is probably more frequent than is usually supposed,\r\nbut it is less frequently detected than pleuritis, the symptoms of\r\nwhich are more conspicuous. It is apt to occur in connection with\r\nendocarditis.\r\n\r\nThe following case, showing the liability to pericarditis and other\r\nserous inflammation which exists in scarlet fever, occurred in my\r\npractice:\r\n\r\n_Case 6._--C----, girl aged five years and ten months, sickened with\r\nsevere scarlet fever on April 4th. Was delirious; pulse 158; had\r\nvomiting and constipation. April 10th, pulse varies from 124 to 153,\r\nno delirium; a considerable quantity of urates in the urine. April\r\n11th, has to-day, for the first time, severe pain in the epigastrium,\r\nwith tenderness and moderate distension. Otherwise symptoms favorable,\r\nbut severe; pulse 140; respiration moderately accelerated, and\r\nvesicular in every part of the chest. From this date the symptoms\r\ncontinued about the same till April 14th, when the dyspnoea became\r\nmore marked and the action of the heart rapid and tumultuous. The\r\nepigastric pain, distension, and tenderness continued; the percussion\r\nsound was dull over the lower part of the chest; the dyspnoea became\r\nrapidly worse, although the pulse had considerable volume; and at 5\r\nP.M. death occurred. At the autopsy about one ounce of turbid serum,\r\nwith a soft deposit of fibrin, was found in the pericardium. Each\r\npleural cavity contained from six to eight ounces of transparent\r\nserum, and both lungs were readily inflated, except a little of the\r\nposterior portion of each lower lobe, which could not be; no fibrinous\r\nexudation over the lungs. The liver extended four inches below the\r\nmargin of the ribs, and upon its convex {523} surface in the\r\nepigastrium, corresponding with the seat of the pain, was a rough\r\npatch of fibrin about one and a half inches in diameter. The bronchial\r\nmucous membrane was moderately injected, as was also that of the\r\ncolon, and the kidneys appeared hyperæmic.\r\n\r\nAmong the serous inflammations which complicate or follow scarlet\r\nfever, pleuritis is one of the most important. It usually begins in\r\nthe desquamative stage, and is apt to be suppurative on account of the\r\nfeeble state of the patient when it commences. It has always, in my\r\npractice, been tedious, as all empyemas are, and it does not differ in\r\nits clinical history from the idiopathic disease. I have met cases of\r\nscarlatinous empyema in which, from opposition of the family or for\r\nother reasons, thoracentesis was not performed, and death occurred;\r\nothers in which this operation effected a cure, and one at least in\r\nwhich the patient recovered by escape of pus through a bronchial tube.\r\nThe pleuritis is seldom latent, or so masked by the symptoms of the\r\ngeneral disease that it is apt to be overlooked. On the other hand,\r\nthe cough, embarrassment of respiration, and pain referred to the\r\naffected side render diagnosis easy.\r\n\r\nDilatation of the heart is common in grave cases of scarlet fever,\r\nsuch cases as are properly termed malignant. It is indicated by a\r\nfeeble and quick pulse. Acute infectious maladies, especially those of\r\na malignant type and accompanied by high febrile movement, are very\r\napt to cause parenchymatous degenerations in organs, prominent among\r\nwhich is granulo-fatty degeneration of the muscular fibres of the\r\nheart. This weakens very much the contractile power of these fibres.\r\nBut early in malignant cases, probably before the muscular fibres are\r\ndamaged, the contractile power of the heart is feeble from impaired\r\ninnervation, the result of the general weakness. Hence this organ,\r\nwhen weakened by structural change and insufficiently stimulated\r\nthrough diminished innervation, may not fully empty itself during the\r\nsystole, and consequently it becomes dilated. Dilatation of the heart\r\nand imperfect contraction of the auricular and ventricular walls are\r\napt to result in the formation of clots in the cavities of the heart;\r\nand this appears to be the immediate cause of death in not a few\r\ninstances. An ante-mortem clot occurring in any of the cavities of the\r\nheart necessarily seriously obstructs the circulation, unless it be of\r\nsmall size. Hence the dyspnoea, which may occur perhaps suddenly, and\r\nthe change of pulse to one of marked feebleness and frequency. Large,\r\nfirm white clots are most frequently found in the right cavities. They\r\ninterlace with the chordæ tendineæ, lie even within the\r\nauriculo-ventricular opening, and send prolongations into the\r\npulmonary artery and the cavæ. Associated with the white clots are\r\ndark, soft clots and fluid blood. The left cavities may be contracted\r\nand empty, or they may contain dark, soft clots or white ante-mortem\r\nclots. Clots in the left ventricle are sometimes prolonged into the\r\naorta as far as the brachio-cephalic branches, while those in the left\r\nauricle may extend to the pulmonary veins. If dilatation of the heart\r\nbe so great that clots form in its cavities, speedy death is probable.\r\nSometimes a patient passes through scarlet fever and appears in a fair\r\nway to recover, when he succumbs to some exhausting sequel distinct\r\nfrom the heart, and at the autopsy the heart is found dilated and\r\ncontaining whitish clots, which are probably ante-mortem, and which\r\nhastened {524} death by obstructing the circulation. Under such\r\ncircumstances this state of the heart is attributable in great measure\r\nto the complication which has weakened its contractile power.\r\n\r\nThe following was a case in point. It occurred in the New York\r\nFoundling Asylum:\r\n\r\n_Case 7._--R. A., aged three years, had scarlet fever, beginning March\r\n23, 1882. The symptoms were favorable at first, but serious\r\ncomplications and sequelæ occurred, which were fatal. The record of\r\nApril 18th reads: \"Appears well nourished, but is anæmic; has\r\notorrhoea; no oedema; skin desquamating; dulness on percussion over\r\nupper third of right side of chest, anteriorly and posteriorly; mucous\r\nrâles and rude breathing over same area; fine râles posteriorly over\r\nlower part of left side of chest; pulse 160, respiration 68,\r\ntemperature 101-2/5°.\" April 20th, is feeble and takes nutriment with\r\ndifficulty; tongue thickly coated; pulse 160, respiration 68,\r\ntemperature 101-2/5°. April 26th, condition about the same as at last\r\nrecord, but he is evidently weaker; the lips are ulcerated and fauces\r\nstill swollen. May 2d, cannot speak distinctly; a brownish,\r\nfoul-smelling secretion lodges on the spoon used in depressing the\r\ntongue; left side of face swollen. On the following night eight\r\nconvulsions occurred, attended by orthopnoea, and mucous râles in the\r\nchest from pulmonary oedema. Diarrhoea supervened and the patient died\r\nabout midnight. Autopsy: Body moderately wasted and very white,\r\nseveral dark-blue spots on scalp and face from hemorrhages underneath;\r\nlips covered with dry crusts; brain of normal appearance; aperture of\r\nthe larynx narrowed at the chink by infiltration and swelling of the\r\ntissues; surface of the vocal cords covered by a thin white film,\r\napparently a fibrinous exudation; tracheal surface hyperæmic; about a\r\ndrachm of straw-colored fluid in each pleural cavity; right lung\r\nwholly adherent by recent exudation of fibrin; left lung also largely\r\nadherent. A careful examination showed the presence of\r\nbroncho-pneumonia in each lung, with considerable infiltration of the\r\nwalls of the bronchi, and cylindrical dilatation of many of them;\r\ncavities of the heart dilated, so that this organ appears much\r\nenlarged, and its shape approaches the globular; its apex is rounded\r\nor obtuse; transverse diameter of the right ventricle, when its walls\r\nwere open and drawn apart, was three and one-quarter inches; that of\r\nthe left ventricle three and a half inches. Similar measurements of\r\nthe heart of another child of about the same age, believed to be\r\nnormal, were about one inch less in each direction. All the cavities\r\ncontain white firm clots along with soft dark clots. Liver of normal\r\nsize, pale; the outer surface and all cut surfaces are studded with\r\nnodules of the size of a pin's head, of a dull, opaque white color.\r\nThese white spots, examined microscopically by Professor Delafield,\r\nare found to be neither tubercles nor gummy tumors, but to consist of\r\npolygonal cells, lying in the meshes of the capillary plexus of veins,\r\nwhich are perfectly preserved. He has not observed a similar case. The\r\nwalls of the gall-bladder are one line or more in thickness, and the\r\ngall-duct is pervious. The microscope shows general hypertrophy of the\r\ngall-bladder and hypertrophy of its papillæ. The urine removed from\r\nthe bladder was found to contain albumen and hyaline casts, and a\r\nmicroscopic examination showed a small amount of parenchymatous\r\ninflammation. The spleen was somewhat enlarged. Punctate congestion of\r\nsmall areas of {525} gastric surface, no increase of mucus; mesenteric\r\nglands uniformly enlarged; jejunum, ileum, and colon exhibited a\r\nslightly increased vascularity. The immediate cause of death appeared\r\nto be imperfect contraction of the heart and the formation of clots in\r\nits cavities, due, apparently to the pleuro-pneumonia as much as, or\r\nmore than, to the primary disease, scarlatina.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dr. Goodhart (_Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1879) reports\r\nseveral interesting cases to confirm his opinion that acute dilatation\r\nof the heart is a not infrequent sequel of scarlatinous nephritis, and\r\nis the cause of death in some apparently inexplicable cases.]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that nephritis in its milder form is much\r\nmore common than was formerly supposed. A few years since little\r\nattention was given by a large proportion of physicians to the state\r\nof the kidneys, and the urine was not examined till dropsy made its\r\nappearance, which only occurs in the more severe forms of nephritis\r\nand is a late symptom. It is now known that catarrh of the renal tubes\r\nfrequently occurs in a mild form early in scarlet fever, without\r\ncausing albuminuria, dropsy, or any notable symptom. It may produce a\r\nsmoky color of the urine, and the appearance in it of granular\r\nepithelial cells, with an increase of mucus, but no albumen. With\r\ncareful treatment and no exposure to cold, the renal catarrh abates\r\nwith the decline of the scarlet fever. It is scarcely severe enough to\r\nmerit the name desquamative, tubal, or parenchymatous nephritis,\r\nthough it is a mild form of the same pathological state. Steiner\r\nstates, as the result of many careful examinations of cases, that\r\nhyperæmia of the kidneys was always present in those who died early in\r\nscarlet fever, and that in a certain proportion of these cases catarrh\r\nof the renal tubules was present in addition to the congestion. Even\r\nin some who died on the second or third day he found cloudiness of the\r\nepithelium in the renal tubes, although the urine had not indicated\r\nsuch a change. The opinion has even been expressed that catarrh of the\r\nrenal tubes is as common in scarlet fever as that of the bronchial\r\ntubes in measles; that is, that it is a uniform element in the\r\ndisease; but this appears to be an exaggerated statement, for others\r\nhave failed to find any evidence of renal catarrh in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThe nephritis which gives rise to symptoms, and therefore interests\r\nthe practitioner, commonly begins in the declining period of scarlet\r\nfever or during the desquamative stage, and is in many instances\r\nplainly attributable to exposure to cold or to currents of air. It\r\noriginates either during this period, or, if it have previously\r\nexisted as a mild renal catarrh, it now becomes aggravated. Dropsy,\r\nwhich always attracts attention, does not occur till the nephritis has\r\ncontinued for some time.\r\n\r\nWhy nephritis, with the subsequent dropsy, so frequently occurs after\r\nscarlet fever is not fully understood. Rilliet and Barthez attribute\r\nit to disturbance of the function of the skin. The fact has long been\r\nobserved that the kidneys become affected nearly if not quite as\r\nfrequently after mild as after severe cases. Indeed, the chief danger\r\nin mild cases, when the patients are but a short time in bed and are\r\nsoon allowed to go about, is from the nephritis. Chilling the surface\r\nand checking cutaneous transpiration appear to be the immediate cause\r\nof this inflammation in a considerable proportion of cases. Therefore,\r\nsevere attacks of scarlet fever with abundant rash and desquamation,\r\nwhich require the patient to be kept in bed the proper time and in a\r\nwarm room two or three {526} weeks, appear to be less frequently\r\nfollowed by this renal disease than are milder cases which are more\r\ncarelessly treated.\r\n\r\nThe most thorough and minute microscopic examination of the state of\r\nthe kidneys in scarlet fever which have come to my notice were those\r\nby E. Klein, published in the _Lond. Path. Soc. Trans._, and\r\nillustrated by microscopic drawings. It appears from these\r\nexaminations that the changes in the kidneys are complex, among which\r\nwe recognize both those of parenchymatous or desquamative nephritis\r\nand interstitial nephritis; but we would infer that the interstitial\r\nnephritis is mild in degree and quite subordinate, or else confined to\r\nportions of the organ, from the fact that so many permanently and\r\nfully recover. The following is a resumé of Klein's examinations in\r\ntwenty-three cases: We conclude from these microscopic researches that\r\nthe anatomical changes of both parenchymatous and interstitial\r\nnephritis are commonly present in greater or less degree in cases of\r\nscarlet fever. If they are mild or confined to portions of the\r\nkidneys, no symptoms occur; but if they are sufficient in extent or\r\ndegree to impair the function of these organs, then symptoms, as\r\nalbuminuria, diminution of urine, etc., appear.\r\n\r\n1. Parenchymatous Nephritis, Proliferation of Nuclei, Hyaline\r\nDegeneration of Arterioles, the Glomerulo-Nephritis of Klebs.--Klein\r\nfound increase of nuclei (probably epithelial) upon the glomeruli and\r\nhyaline degeneration of the intima of minute arteries, especially\r\nmarked in the afferent arterioles of the Malpighian bodies. The intima\r\nof these vessels was in places so swollen as to resemble cylindrical\r\nor spindle-shaped hyaline masses, and cause narrowing of the lumina of\r\nthe vessels in which this degeneration occurred. Klein observed in\r\nsome specimens so great hyaline degeneration of the capillaries of the\r\nMalpighian bodies that circulation through them was obstructed. In the\r\nmore advanced or protracted cases this hyaline substance in the\r\nglomeruli began to assume a fibrous appearance. Bowman's capsule was\r\nconsiderably thickened. This hyaline degeneration of the Malpighian\r\nbodies Klein discovered in the earliest cases which fell under his\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nAlso in the earliest cases the multiplication or germination of the\r\nnuclei of the muscular coat of the arterioles was observed, with a\r\ncorresponding increase in the thickness of the walls of these vessels.\r\nThis change in the muscular element was observed in the arterioles in\r\ndifferent parts of the kidney, but it was most conspicuous in\r\narterioles at their point of entrance into the Malpighian bodies; and\r\nit was distinctly observed in other arterioles, both in the cortex and\r\nin the base of the pyramids.\r\n\r\nIn the glandular portion of the kidneys other anatomical alterations\r\nwere observed, indicating parenchymatous nephritis. There were\r\nswelling of the epithelial lining of the convoluted tubes;\r\nmultiplication of nuclei of epithelial cells, especially in ascending\r\ntubules, which lay close to the afferent arterioles of Malpighian\r\ncorpuscles; granular matter, and even blood, in the cavity of Bowman's\r\ncapsule and in the convoluted tubes; cloudy swelling and granular\r\ndisintegration of epithelium in some parts of the convoluted tubes;\r\ndetachment of epithelium from the membrane of larger ducts of the\r\npyramids in some cases. These parenchymatous changes are already known\r\nto the profession through the observations and writings of Dickinson,\r\nFenwick, Johnson, John Simon, and others.\r\n\r\n{527} Klein, in commenting on the hyaline degeneration which he\r\nobserved, states that Neelsen found the walls of the capillaries of\r\nthe pia mater thickened, highly refractive, and of a lardaceous\r\nappearance in certain acute infectious maladies, as variola, typhoid\r\nfever, measles, and in one case of scarlet fever.[4] Usually, only a\r\nsmall portion of the capillaries were thus affected, most frequently\r\nat the point of division into branchlets. In a few instances Neelsen\r\nobserved degeneration of arterioles extending a considerable distance,\r\nwith fusion of the intima, media and adventitia, and chemical\r\nexamination showed that the substance produced by this degeneration\r\nhad similar properties to elastic tissue. Although the examinations by\r\nNeelsen relate to the pia mater, two of his observations are\r\nespecially interesting--first, that the hyaline change affects chiefly\r\nvessels near their point of branching; and, secondly, that the hyaline\r\nsubstance is of the nature of elastic tissue, for in the kidney in\r\nscarlatinous nephritis the arterioles undergo the change in question\r\nchiefly near their point of branching into the capillaries of the\r\nglomerulus; and the intima being the part which undergoes the hyaline\r\nchange, it is probable, in the opinion of Klein, that the same\r\nsubstance is produced by the degeneration in walls of the vessels of\r\nthe kidney which Neelsen observed in the pia mater, and therefore that\r\nit is of the nature of elastic tissue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1876.]\r\n\r\nThis hyaline degeneration of the arterioles is also very marked in the\r\nspleen in scarlet fever; and in studying the minute anatomy of the\r\nintestines and spleen in typhoid fever Klein has found the same\r\ndegeneration of the intima of the minute vessels. He believes that\r\nthis hyaline change and the proliferation of muscle-nuclei which thus\r\noccur at an early period in scarlet fever in the renal vessels when\r\nthe kidneys become affected are due to an irritating cause acting\r\nsimilarly to that in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nKlein calls attention to the interesting examinations of the\r\nscarlatinous kidney made by Klebs, who attributed the diminished\r\nurination and the uræmic poisoning in certain cases in which the\r\nkidneys do not exhibit any marked change to the naked eye, to what he\r\ndesignates glomerulo-nephritis. Klebs says: \"In the post-mortem\r\nexamination the kidneys are found slightly or not at all enlarged,\r\nfirm, ... the parenchyma very hyperæmic. Only the glomeruli appear, on\r\nclose inspection, pale like small white dots. The urinary tubes are\r\noften not changed at all. Occasionally the convoluted tubes are\r\nslightly cloudy. The microscopic examination shows that there are\r\nneither interstitial changes nor proliferation of epithelium, the\r\nso-called renal catarrh generally supposed to be present in these\r\nconditions on account of the absence of other perceptible\r\nderangements; and there seems, therefore, leaving out the glomeruli,\r\nthe congestion of the kidneys alone to remain to account for the\r\nsymptoms during life.\" But that mere congestion is insufficient to\r\nproduce the symptoms appears from the fact that it does not produce\r\nthem under other circumstances. Klebs finds, \"on microscopic\r\nexamination of the glomerulus, the whole space of the capsule filled\r\nwith small somewhat angular nuclei, imbedded in a finely granular\r\nmass. The vessels of the glomerulus are almost completely covered by\r\nnuclear masses.\"\r\n\r\nKlein, commenting on these examinations by Klebs, states that in all\r\n{528} early cases which he examined he observed great abundance of\r\nnuclei of the glomeruli, but a condition like that described and\r\nfigured by Klebs[5] he has seen in only a few glomeruli; for a general\r\nstate of these bodies, as described by this observer, and such an\r\nexcessive proliferation of the nuclei that the blood-vessels are\r\ncompletely compressed, was not seen in one of the twenty-three cases.\r\nKlein therefore questions whether the diminished urination and\r\nretention of urea in scarlet fever, when the kidneys do not exhibit\r\nany conspicuous catarrhal or other change, is due, unless in\r\nexceptional instances, to compression of the vessels of the glomeruli\r\nby nuclear germination, but believes, rather, that the obstructed\r\ncirculation, and consequent diminished urinary excretion, is largely\r\ndue to the changed state of the arterioles. Klein adds that perhaps\r\nundue contraction of the arterioles, through stimulation by the\r\nblood-irritant, may also be a factor in causing arrest of circulation\r\nin the Malpighian corpuscles. As regards cases that perished early, he\r\nfound the parenchymatous change slight, so that a careful examination\r\nwas required in order to detect cloudy swelling and granular\r\ndegeneration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Handbuch der Pathol._, p. 646, fig. 72.]\r\n\r\n2. Interstitial Nephritis.--A second set of changes Klein observed in\r\ncases that died on about the ninth or tenth day. In such cases he\r\nfound changes due to interstitial, in addition to those produced by\r\nparenchymatous, nephritis. Round cells, lymphoid cells, or whatever\r\nelse they should be called, were seen in the connective tissue of the\r\nkidneys. In the kidneys of those that died at the end of the first\r\nweek after the commencement of nephritis, infiltration with round\r\ncells was observed in the connective tissue around the large vascular\r\ntrunks. At a later stage this infiltration had extended into the bases\r\nof the pyramids and into the cortex. The gradual increase in extent\r\nand intensity of this infiltration was so decided in the cases which\r\nKlein observed that he has no hesitation in concluding that when\r\ninterstitial nephritis occurs it begins about the end of the first\r\nweek, in the manner already stated--to wit, as a slight infiltration\r\nof the tissue around the large vascular trunks, and gradually extends,\r\nso that portions of the cortex, and rarely portions of the base of the\r\npyramids, are changed into firm, pale, round-cell tissue, in which the\r\noriginal tubes of the cortex become lost.\r\n\r\nThe infiltration of the cortex with round cells, beginning at the\r\nroots of the interlobular vessels, spreads rapidly toward the capsule\r\nof the kidney, and laterally among the convoluted tubes around the\r\nMalpighian bodies.... In the course of this process considerable parts\r\nof the peripheral cortex, occasionally of a more or less distinctly\r\ncuneiform shape, with the base nearest the capsule of the kidney,\r\nbecome changed into whitish, firm, bloodless, cellular masses, in\r\nwhich Malpighian corpuscles and urinary tubes are only imperfectly\r\nrecognized, being more or less degenerated. In some cases attended by\r\nthis infiltration of the cortex Klein observed a more or less dense\r\nreticulation of fibres, especially around the interlobular arteries,\r\ncontaining in its meshes lymph-cells, chiefly uninuclear.\r\n\r\nIn a child of five years that died after a sickness of thirteen days\r\nKlein found evidence of intense interstitial inflammation, and also\r\nemboli, consisting of fibrin with a few cells, in the arteries, both\r\nin those of large size and in the arterioles, chiefly where they enter\r\nthe Malpighian corpuscles. {529} He states that in the specimens which\r\nhe examined the more intense the degree of interstitial change, the\r\ngreater was the enlargement of the kidneys, and the more distinct also\r\nwere the evidences of parenchymatous nephritis in the urinary tubes,\r\nwhich either contained casts or were in the process of destruction. By\r\nbeing crowded with inflammatory products, especially cells, the\r\nMalpighian corpuscles were obliterated, undergoing fibrous\r\ndegeneration. A very curious fact observed was the deposit of lime in\r\nthe urinary tubes, first of the cortex, and then also of the pyramids,\r\nat an early stage of scarlet fever, when the kidneys otherwise showed\r\nonly slight change. Several observers, as Biermer, Coats, and Wagner,\r\nhave each described a case of scarlet fever with interstitial\r\nnephritis, which they consider unusual; but Klein has apparently\r\ndemonstrated, as we have seen, by a large number of microscopic\r\nexaminations, that this form of nephritis is common after the ninth or\r\ntenth day.\r\n\r\nNephritis, in proportion to its extent and gravity, is accompanied by\r\nlanguor, febrile movement, thirst, loss of appetite and strength. At\r\nfirst the patient experiences but slight pain in the head or\r\nelsewhere, and the quantity of urine is not notably diminished; but as\r\nthe disease continues urination becomes less frequent and the urine\r\nmore scanty. Albuminuria occurs, while the urea is only partially\r\nexcreted, and therefore accumulates in the blood. If the nephritis be\r\nso severe or protracted that this principle accumulates to a certain\r\nextent, grave symptoms occur, as headache, vomiting, apathy or\r\nrestlessness, and, more dangerous than all, eclampsia, which is not\r\nunusual in these cases. Microscopic examination of the urine shows the\r\npresence in this liquid of blood-corpuscles, granular epithelial\r\ncells, and hyaline or granular casts, or both. The specific gravity of\r\nthe urine is diminished. But a large quantity of albumen in the urine\r\nmay render the specific gravity as high or higher than in health.\r\n\r\nThe altered state of the blood soon gives rise to transudation of\r\nserum, first observed in most cases as an anasarca occurring in the\r\nfeet and ankles. The oedema, if not checked by treatment or through\r\nmildness of the disease, extends over the limbs, scrotum, and\r\nsometimes upon the trunk. It is well if the dropsy remain limited to\r\nthe subcutaneous connective tissue, but, unfortunately, it is apt to\r\noccur, if the nephritis continue, in and around the internal organs,\r\nproducing, mentioned in the order of frequency, pulmonary oedema,\r\neffusion into the pleural and peritoneal cavities, the pericardium,\r\nthe encephalon, and lastly into the connective tissue of the larynx,\r\ncausing that very fatal complication, oedema of the glottis. Although\r\nthis is the common order in which dropsies occur, exceptions are not\r\ninfrequent. Even the anasarca may not be the first to appear, although\r\nin the vast majority of cases it has the precedence. Thus, Rilliet\r\nrelates the case of a boy of five years who twenty days after the\r\noccurrence of scarlet fever, and six hours after the appearance of\r\nbloody and albuminous urine, had double hydrothorax, rapidly\r\ndeveloped. As long as the hydrothorax continued no anasarca was\r\nobserved, but as it declined anasarca appeared. Legendre cites a case\r\nin which oedema of the lungs occurred without anasarca or other\r\ndropsy. Occasionally, the anasarca and internal dropsies take place\r\nnearly simultaneously. The nephritis and consequent serous effusions\r\nusually appear within three weeks after scarlet fever ends, but cases\r\noccur in which the effusions are first observed as late as the fourth\r\nand fifth weeks. The patient may be {530} considered to possess\r\nimmunity from this sequel if he have reached the close of the fifth\r\nweek after the abatement of scarlet fever without its occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe dropsy is usually acute, but it may assume the chronic form, since\r\nthe nephritis which causes it, happily curable in most instances, may,\r\nif neglected, become chronic. Whether the dropsy in itself involve\r\ndanger depends in great part on its location. Anasarca and ascites may\r\nexist a long time with little suffering or danger, but a small amount\r\nof serum in certain other localities causes alarming symptoms and\r\nspeedy death. Oedema of the lungs, hydro-pericardium, oedema of the\r\nglottis, and intracranial effusions are always dangerous, and the last\r\ntwo are sometimes fatal within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.\r\nOedema of the lungs has been fatal within twelve hours from the\r\noccurrence of the first symptoms of obstructed respiration.\r\n\r\nCerebral symptoms occurring during scarlatinous nephritis are probably\r\nsometimes due to the irritating effect of the retained urea on the\r\nnervous centre. In other cases the cause appears to be cerebral oedema\r\nor compression of the brain by effusion of serum within the ventricles\r\nand upon the surface of the brain. Headache, dull or severe,\r\ndilatation of the pupils or their oscillation in the same degree of\r\nlight, vomiting with little apparent nausea, are common symptoms of\r\nscarlatinous nephritis when it has continued a few days, and the\r\nexcretion of urea is so diminished that this substance begins to exert\r\nits poisonous effect on the system. Such symptoms are apt to be\r\nfollowed by somnolence, threatening coma, or by eclampsia, unless the\r\npatients are promptly and properly treated. In some patients that die\r\nof scarlatinous nephritis, death occurring in convulsions or coma, no\r\nappreciable lesions are observed within the cranium, unless more or\r\nless congestion, the fatal ending being attributable to the uræmia. In\r\nother instances we find an effusion of serum within the ventricles or\r\nupon the surface of the brain. Although the symptoms in scarlatinous\r\nnephritis and uræmia may appear very unfavorable, the prognosis is\r\nusually good under prompt and appropriate treatment. Thus severe\r\nconvulsions and a degree of somnolence that bordered on coma may\r\nabate, and convalescence be fully established within a few days, and\r\nRilliet and Barthez announce ten recoveries in thirteen patients\r\naffected with convulsions due to this renal affection.\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Scarlet fever being, as we have seen, a\r\nconstitutional febrile disease of an ataxic nature, and accompanied by\r\ncertain inflammations, necessarily affects the composition of the\r\nblood; but since this disease varies so greatly in type or severity,\r\nthe state and appearance of this liquid also vary. At the autopsies of\r\nthe more malignant cases we find the blood dark and fluid, with small,\r\nsoft, and dark clots in the heart and large vessels. In other cases\r\nthe clots are large, firm, and solid, as described in a preceding\r\npage. In malignant cases that end fatally Rilliet and Barthez state\r\nthat both the large and small vessels of the cerebral meninges and the\r\nbrain are found hyperæmic, but in a variable degree. In those who die\r\nin coma, preceded by delirium or convulsions, during the eruptive\r\nstage, the intracranial congestion is usually marked, with perhaps\r\nsome transudation of serum, but without inflammatory lesions. The\r\nfibrin in scarlet fever remains in about normal proportion, except as\r\nit is increased by inflammatory {531} complications. Andral found an\r\nincrease in the proportion of blood-corpuscles from 127 to 136 parts\r\nin 1000.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory apparatus, except the Schneiderian membrane, is\r\nusually normal when no complications exist. Samuel Fenwick[6] made\r\npost-mortem examinations in sixteen cases of scarlet fever, and\r\nconcludes from them that inflammation of the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach and intestines occurs like that of the skin, followed by\r\ndesquamation of the epithelial cells, like that of the epidermis. I\r\nhave had the opportunity of examining the stomach and intestines of\r\nthose who died of scarlet fever in the eruptive stage, and have not\r\nfound any unusual hyperæmia of the gastro-intestinal surface, except\r\nwhen gastro-intestinal inflammation, usually indicated by diarrhoea,\r\nhad occurred as a complication.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _London Lancet_, July 23, 1864.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the abdominal organs exhibit changes which suggest a\r\nresemblance to typhoid fever. The spleen is enlarged and somewhat\r\nsoftened, and Peyer's patches and the solitary glands are thickened\r\nand prominent, but less in degree than in typhoid fever. The\r\nmesenteric glands also are in a state of hyperplasia. In other\r\npatients these parts appear normal.\r\n\r\nKlein made microscopic examination of the liver in eight cases, and\r\nstates that he found granular opaque swelling of liver-cells, and\r\nchanges in the internal and middle coats of certain arteries similar\r\nto those observed in the kidneys, which have been described above. He\r\nalso found evidences of interstitial inflammation, as an increase of\r\nround cells and connective tissue in the liver. He remarks also that\r\nhe observed hyaline degeneration of the intima of arteries in the\r\nspleen. Rilliet and Barthez state that swelling and softening of the\r\nspleen are exceptional in scarlet fever, but are sufficiently common\r\nto merit attention. In post-mortem examinations which I have witnessed\r\nnothing noteworthy has appeared to the naked eye in the state of the\r\nliver, nor ordinarily in that of the spleen.\r\n\r\nThe efflorescence, though one of the anatomical characters, has\r\nperhaps been sufficiently described in the foregoing pages. It begins\r\nover the neck, chest, and groins as numerous reddish points not larger\r\nthan a pin's head, closely crowded together, but with skin of normal\r\ncolor between. It is estimated that the aggregate efflorescence and\r\naggregate normal skin over a given area are about equal. If the\r\ncutaneous circulation be active and the febrile movement be\r\nconsiderable these spots extend and coalesce, producing an\r\nefflorescence like erythema or like the hue of a boiled lobster, to\r\nwhich it has been likened. The efflorescence, less upon the face than\r\nupon the trunk, contrasts in this respect with that of measles, in\r\nwhich the rash is full in the face, often causing some swelling of the\r\nfeatures. It is also less upon the palmar and plantar surfaces than\r\nelsewhere. It scarcely causes any perceptible elevation of the skin,\r\nbut in certain localities, as upon the backs of the hands and upon the\r\nfore-arms, it communicates the sensation of slight roughness. The seat\r\nof the efflorescence is mainly in the superficial layers of the skin,\r\nbut it is said that it sometimes has occurred upon a cicatrix, as that\r\nfrom a burn. In the robust and in favorable cases in which the\r\ncirculation is active the rash has a scarlet hue, and when the\r\ncutaneous capillaries are emptied and the skin rendered pale by\r\npressure with the {532} fingers, the circulation immediately returns\r\nwhen the pressure is removed. In malignant cases the color is not\r\nscarlet, but dusky red, and so sluggish is the capillary circulation\r\nthat the skin when pressed upon recovers the blood very slowly. In\r\ngrave cases also extravasation of blood in minute points or\r\ntransudation of its coloring matter is apt to occur in portions of the\r\nsurface, when of course decolorization is not fully produced by\r\npressure. In cases ending fatally, during the eruptive stage the\r\nefflorescence may entirely disappear in the cadaver, or it remains\r\nupon parts of the surface, especially depending portions. Desquamation\r\nis attributable to the exaggerated proliferation of the epidermis and\r\nthe loosening of its attachment by the inflammation.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--In the commencement of scarlet fever, prior to the\r\neruption, no symptoms or appearances exist which enable us to make a\r\npositive diagnosis. Positive statement in reference to the nature of\r\nthe attack should be deferred, for the credit of the physician. Still,\r\nif a child with no appreciable local disease sufficient to cause the\r\nsymptoms a few days after exposure to scarlet fever, or during an\r\nepidemic of this malady, be suddenly seized with fever, the pulse\r\nrising to 110, 120, or more, and the temperature to 102°, 103°, or\r\n105°, scarlatina should be suspected. The diagnosis is rendered more\r\ncertain at this early stage if vomiting occur, and especially if the\r\nfauces be red, for hyperæmia of the fauces, due to commencing\r\npharyngitis, is one of the earliest and most constant of the local\r\nmanifestations of scarlatina.\r\n\r\nWhen the eruption has appeared the nature of the malady is in most\r\ninstances apparent. The punctate character of the eruption before it\r\nbecomes confluent, its occurrence within twenty-four hours after the\r\nfever begins over almost the entire surface, but its absence or\r\nscantiness upon the face, and especially around the mouth, serve to\r\ndistinguish it from other diseases.\r\n\r\nScarlet fever and measles were long considered identical by the\r\nprofession, and, though the ordinary forms of these maladies can be\r\nreadily distinguished from each other, cases occur in which the\r\ndifferential diagnosis is attended by some difficulty. But there are\r\ndifferences in the symptoms and course of the two diseases which aid\r\nin discriminating one from the other. Measles begins with marked\r\ncatarrhal symptoms, as if from a severe cold. Mild conjunctivitis,\r\ncausing weak and watery eyes, coryza, and mild laryngo-bronchitis,\r\nwith accompanying cough, precede the eruption three or four days and\r\ncontinue during the eruptive stage. The febrile movement in the\r\nprodromic stage of measles is remittent, the evening temperature being\r\ntwo or three degrees higher than that in the morning. Contrast this\r\nwith the invasion of scarlet fever, in which the only catarrh is that\r\nof the buccal and faucial surfaces, and there is consequently little\r\nor no cough, and the febrile movement, ordinarily high in the\r\nbeginning, is nearly uniform in the different hours of the day. The\r\nscarlatinous eruption appears, as we have seen, within twelve to\r\ntwenty-four hours about the neck and upper part of the chest, and\r\nspreads over the body in a shorter time than that of measles, which\r\nappears on the third day. The rash of measles begins to fade at the\r\nclose of the third or in the fourth day after its appearance, that of\r\nscarlet fever not till from the sixth to the eighth day. In nearly all\r\ncases of measles, even when the rash is confluent upon the face and a\r\n{533} considerable part of the trunk, in consequence of the high\r\nfebrile movement and vigorous cutaneous circulation, we observe the\r\ncharacteristic rubeolar eruption upon certain parts of the surface, as\r\nthe extremities, which, in connection with the history, renders\r\ndiagnosis certain.\r\n\r\nErythema resembles the scarlatinous eruption, but its duration is\r\ncommonly shorter. It is limited to a part of the surface, and it is\r\naccompanied by much less febrile movement. The temperature in erythema\r\ndoes not usually rise above 100°, unless for a few hours, whereas in\r\nscarlet fever it continues considerably above 100° for several days.\r\nThe scarlatinous efflorescence has also a brighter red or more scarlet\r\nhue than that of erythema, except in the more malignant cases, in\r\nwhich the severity of the symptoms renders the diagnosis clear. But an\r\nimportant aid in differentiating the one from the other of these\r\ndiseases is the fact that in erythema there is, with few exceptions,\r\nno faucial inflammation, and in the few instances in which it is\r\npresent it is slight and transient, fading within a day or two.\r\n\r\nScarlet fever is readily diagnosticated from diphtheria, although the\r\naffinity is close between these two maladies. The early appearance of\r\nthe pseudo-membrane upon the fauces in diphtheria, its absence in\r\nscarlet fever, and the absence of any appearance resembling it until\r\nthe fever has continued some days, and the characteristic\r\nefflorescence upon the skin in scarlet fever, render diagnosis easy.\r\nIf scarlet fever have continued some days when first seen by the\r\nphysician, the diphtheritic pseudo-membrane may be present as a\r\ncomplication, or the fauces may present an appearance like diphtheria\r\nfrom ulceration or sloughing and the presence of foul and offensive\r\nsecretions, which produce a dark-grayish and fetid mass over the\r\nfaucial surface. Under such circumstances the character of the disease\r\nis ascertained by the history of the case, and especially by the\r\noccurrence of the scarlatinous eruption. An erythema transient and\r\nlimited to a part of the surface sometimes appears in the commencement\r\nof diphtheria, and at a later period, as a result of the toxæmia,\r\npoints of a roseoloid appearance and irregular patches, often located\r\nupon the extremities. Both kinds of rash can be readily diagnosticated\r\nfrom that of scarlet fever, for the erythema, as has been stated, is\r\ntransient and partial, and does not exhibit minute points of deeper\r\ninjection, while the toxæmic rash differs in form and aspect from that\r\nof scarlet fever, and appears at a stage of the case when the\r\nscarlatinous efflorescence would have faded or begun to fade.\r\n\r\nThe efflorescence of rötheln sometimes closely resembles that of\r\nscarlet fever, though it is usually more like that of measles; but it\r\nis ordinarily accompanied by symptoms which are much milder than those\r\nof scarlet fever, and it begins to abate as early as the third, and\r\ndisappears on the fourth, day. The eyes have a suffused appearance,\r\nthe temperature may reach 102° or 103°, and the efflorescence may be\r\nas general over the body as that of scarlet fever, but there is not\r\nthe aspect of serious indisposition, and the speedy abatement of the\r\nsymptoms shows that the disease is not scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis depends on the form of scarlet fever,\r\nwhether mild or severe, the strength of the patient, and the presence\r\nor absence of complications or sequelæ. The type of this disease is\r\nsometimes so mild throughout an epidemic or during a series of years\r\nthat {534} death seldom occurs, whatever the mode of treatment; but\r\nafterward the type changes, and the percentage of deaths increases and\r\nremains high till another mitigation in the type occurs.\r\n\r\nSydenham in the middle of the seventeenth century stated that scarlet\r\nfever, as he saw it in London, was so mild that it scarcely deserved\r\nthe name of disease: \"Vix nomen morbi merebatur.\" Morton some years\r\nlater, and Huxham in the following century, had abundant reason to\r\nregret the change of type, and now throughout Great Britain scarlet\r\nfever is one of the most fatal and most dreaded of the diseases of\r\nchildhood. In Dublin during the present century, prior to 1834,\r\nscarlet fever was uniformly mild, so that on one occasion of eighty\r\npatients in an institution all recovered. In 1834 the type of the\r\ndisease totally changed and epidemics of unusual virulence occurred.\r\nThe type frequently changes from mild to severe or severe to mild, not\r\nonly in consecutive years, but in consecutive months. A few years\r\nsince a distinguished physician of New York treated about fifty cases\r\nof scarlet fever in one of the institutions without a single death,\r\nbut a few months later the type of the malady changed, and his own son\r\nwas among those who perished from it. The prevailing type of the\r\ndisease should therefore be considered in giving the prognosis when in\r\nthe commencement of a case we are asked the probability as regards the\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nExtensive statistics, including those collected by Murchison from\r\nvarious sources, show that in different epidemics the mortality may\r\nvary as much as from 3 per cent. (Eulenberg of Coblentz) to 19.3 per\r\ncent. (cases seen by myself in New York City in 1881-82, many of which\r\nwere complicated by diphtheria), or even to 34 per cent. (epidemic in\r\nthe Palatinate in 1868-69). The hospital statistics of Rilliet and\r\nBarthez gave 46 deaths in 87 cases, or about 53 per cent.\r\n\r\nObservations have thus far failed to establish any connection in the\r\natmospheric conditions of temperature or moisture and the type of\r\nscarlet fever. Grave as well as mild epidemics have occurred in all\r\nclimates and seasons.\r\n\r\nThe mortality is nearly equal in the two sexes, but age bears a marked\r\ninfluence on the percentage of deaths. Comparatively few contract\r\nscarlet fever under the age of one year, and the period of its\r\ngreatest mortality, since it is of its greatest frequency, is between\r\nthe ages of one and six years. The following are statistics bearing on\r\nthe relation of the age to the percentage of deaths:\r\n\r\n                                From the\r\n                                close of    From the\r\n                                1st till    5th to\r\n                      Under     close of    the 12th\r\n                      1 year.   5th year.   year.\r\n                      -------   ---------   --------\r\n  Fleishman, Cases       8        204         260\r\n             Deaths      6         88          51\r\n\r\n                                1st to                  From the\r\n                                close of    6th to      12th to\r\n                                6th year.   12th year.  20th year.\r\n                                ---------   ----------  ----------\r\n  Kraus,     Cases      13        113         106          40\r\n             Deaths      4         29          10           2\r\n\r\n                                            7th to\r\n                                            16th year.\r\n                                            ----------\r\n  Voit,      Cases       5        166         109\r\n             Deaths      1         24          10\r\n\r\n                                1st to\r\n                                close of    Over\r\n                                5th year.   5 years.\r\n                                ---------   --------\r\n  Röset,     Cases      43        156          88\r\n             Deaths     26         31           3\r\n\r\n{535}                 Under     5th to      10th to     Over\r\n                      5 years.  10th year.  15th year.  15 years.\r\n                      --------  ----------  ----------  ---------\r\n  Rusigger,  Cases     101        126          47          27\r\n             Deaths     21         20           3           0\r\n\r\nThese statistics, which I believe correspond with the observations of\r\nothers, show that although few cases occur in the first year, the\r\npercentage of deaths is large, and that a majority of the deaths occur\r\nunder the age of six years. After the sixth year the greater the age\r\nthe less the proportionate number of deaths.\r\n\r\nScarlet fever is liable to so many complications and sequelæ that a\r\nphysician should not predict a certain favorable termination in the\r\nbeginning, however mild and regular the symptoms may be. But a\r\nfavorable result may be expected if the attack be mild, the\r\nefflorescence appear at the proper time and extend over the entire\r\nsurface, the angina be moderate and accompanied by little or no\r\ncellulitis or adenitis, with pulse under 140, temperature not above\r\n103°, and no marked nervous symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhether the complications or sequelæ be dangerous depends upon their\r\ncharacter. Rheumatism has never in my practice been dangerous, nor has\r\nit materially retarded convalescence, except when it affected the\r\nheart, causing pericarditis or endocarditis, when it involves great\r\ndanger. Nephritis, if it be moderate, attended by little albuminuria\r\nand serous effusion, and by the occurrence of few renal casts in the\r\nurine, commonly ends favorably under judicious treatment, as we have\r\nalready stated; but severe nephritis, with abundant albuminuria and\r\ncasts and serous effusions, soon gives rise to alarming symptoms, and\r\nis the cause of death in a considerable number of instances. A similar\r\nremark is applicable to the angina, which occurs in all grades of\r\nseverity. If it be attended by much cellulitis, with considerable\r\nulceration or necrosis, the state is one of danger, in consequence of\r\nthe difficulty in administering sufficient nutriment, of the\r\ndiminished assimilation and of the loss of strength from the prolonged\r\ninflammatory fever, the septic poisoning, and the occasional\r\nhemorrhages. Complication by pharyngeal or nasal diphtheria, now so\r\ncommon where diphtheria is endemic, also greatly increases the danger.\r\n\r\nMany cases, even when their course is normal and without\r\ncomplications, involve danger, and some are necessarily fatal, from\r\nthe direct effect of the scarlatinous blood-poisoning. Such are grave\r\nor malignant forms of the disease which the experienced eye recognizes\r\nat a glance. Death often occurs rapidly from the toxæmia. Such cases\r\nare characterized by high temperature (105° or 106°), rapid pulse, a\r\ndusky-red hue of the surface from languid capillary circulation,\r\npungent heat, frequent vomiting, diarrhoeal stools, a dry-brown\r\ntongue, and marked nervous symptoms, such as delirium, great\r\nrestlessness, or stupor. Not a few in this form of scarlet fever take\r\neclampsia, which is apt to be severe and repeated, and to end in fatal\r\ncoma.\r\n\r\nOther inflammatory complications and sequelæ, which have been\r\ndescribed in the preceding pages, retard convalescence and jeopardize\r\nthe life of the patient, such as empyema, endocarditis, pericarditis,\r\nand pneumonia. Otitis media is seldom immediately dangerous, although\r\nit may be painful and involve serious consequences, even a fatal\r\nmeningitis, as has been stated above, after months or years of\r\notorrhoea. Anomalous cases are believed to be, as a rule, more\r\ndangerous than such as are {536} attended by an early and full\r\nefflorescence and have the usual symptoms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--PROPHYLAXIS. Since the discovery by Jenner of the\r\nprophylactic power of vaccination as regards small-pox, the attention\r\nof the profession has been frequently directed to the prevention of\r\nscarlet fever. Belladonna has been employed for this purpose by a\r\nclass of practitioners who believe in the theory that an agent which\r\nproduces symptoms similar to those of a disease is antagonistic to\r\nthat disease, and therefore tends to prevent it, or, if it be present,\r\nto render it milder; and since this herb causes an efflorescence upon\r\nthe skin and redness of the fauces, it was selected as the proper\r\npreventive and remedial agent for scarlet fever. Its use, however, for\r\nthis purpose has been fruitless, and it is now nearly or quite\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, from a considerable number of observations, that\r\nscarlet fever occasionally occurs in the domestic animals during\r\nepidemics of the disease in children. It is stated that Spinola\r\nobserved it in the horse; that Heim saw a dog that occupied the same\r\nbed with a scarlatinous patient sicken with fever, which was followed\r\nby desquamation; that Letheby saw scarlatina in swine, and Kraus in\r\nyoung cattle. Prominent veterinary surgeons, as Williams of Great\r\nBritain, admit the occurrence of scarlatina in animals, and the hope\r\nhas arisen that since small-pox is modified in cattle so as to afford\r\nus the vaccine virus, perhaps scarlet fever may also be modified by\r\npassing through one of the lower animals, so that a milder and less\r\nfatal form of the disease might be produced in man by inoculation from\r\nthe animal. This theory, though it deserves investigation, is far from\r\nbeing established. It has not yet, so far as I am aware, been shown\r\nthat scarlet fever is milder in any animal than in man, nor, if we\r\nadmit that it is modified in the animal, is it certain that the\r\ndisease could be returned to man in the modified form. In the _N.Y.\r\nMedical Record_ for March 24, 1883, some experiments are detailed by\r\nS. W. Strickler of Orange, New Jersey. He cites the experiments of\r\nCaze and Feltz, who injected scarlatinal blood under the skin of\r\nsixty-six rabbits, and of these sixty-two died within eighteen hours\r\nto fourteen days, which indicated a highly poisonous state of the\r\nblood employed, either septic or scarlatinous, and certainly no\r\nmitigation of the virulence of the scarlet fever. Strickler obtained\r\nfrom Williams of Edinburgh nasal mucus from a horse supposed to have\r\nscarlatina, and with it inoculated twelve children, all of whom had\r\nsores at the point of inoculation, with redness of the skin around the\r\nsores, and in some instances swelling of the adjacent lymphatic\r\nglands. It is stated that the children thus inoculated did not\r\ncontract scarlet fever subsequently when they were exposed to\r\nscarlatina. Obviously, there is a serious objection to such\r\nexperiments upon children, so that they may not be repeated, but a\r\nmovement has been made in one of the New York medical societies\r\nlooking to the appointment of a competent committee to investigate\r\nthem. Some of the prominent veterinary surgeons of this city do not\r\nattach much importance to the experiments thus far made, as they are\r\nin doubt whether the virus employed was that of the genuine disease.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of great interest and importance, and one not yet\r\nelucidated, whether or to what extent disinfectant and antiseptic\r\nremedies administered internally prevent the occurrence of the\r\ninfectious maladies {537} in those who have been exposed, and aid in\r\ncuring those who are sick with them. Sodium sulpho-carbolate, from\r\nwhich, by decomposition in the system, carbolic acid is supposed to be\r\nset free, has been used for this purpose. It is administered to adults\r\nin doses of ten to thirty grains, and to children in doses\r\nproportionate to their age. Declat has prepared a syrup of phenic\r\n(carbolic) acid as a preventive and curative agent in the infectious\r\ndiseases. It is now employed by several of the New York physicians,\r\nbut thus far the statistics of its use are not sufficient to determine\r\nits efficacy. It is a question whether the so-called antiseptics can,\r\non account of their toxic properties, be used with safety in doses\r\nsufficiently large to be antidotal to the specific principle of any of\r\nthe infectious maladies.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to recommend in this treatise any remedial\r\nagent that has not been fully tried and its efficacy determined; but\r\nfrom observations made by myself in nearly twenty families in which\r\nscarlet fever was prevailing, I am convinced that boracic acid (acidum\r\nboricum), an antiseptic recently introduced into our Pharmacopoeia,\r\ndeserves trial as a preventive and antidote of scarlet fever as well\r\nas diphtheria. The good result in my practice from the use of this\r\nagent, which only extends over about six months, may be due to the\r\npresent type of scarlet fever, but I have been surprised at the\r\nfavorable progress of the cases which appeared very grave in the\r\nbeginning, at the small mortality, and at the large proportion of well\r\nchildren exposed to scarlatinous cases that escaped infection, to whom\r\nthis medicine was regularly administered. Boric (boracic) acid has\r\nbeen recently used by aurists with remarkable success in suppurating\r\nand granulating otitis media, and by oculists as an eye-wash. E. R.\r\nSquibbs says of it (_Ephemeris_, May, 1883): \"A solution saturated at\r\nordinary temperatures contains between 4 and 5 per cent.... It is a\r\nvery bland and soothing application, whether applied in powder or\r\nsolution, relieving irritation and reducing suppuration.... It has\r\nbeen administered internally in large doses without any disturbing\r\neffects.\" The preparation which I have employed is one found in the\r\nshops, with the name listerine, prepared by a Western pharmaceutical\r\nfirm. It contains, according to the manufacturers, the \"essential\r\nantiseptic constituents of thyme, eucalyptus, baptisia, gaultheria,\r\nand mentha arvensis,\" and also two grains of benzo-boracic acid in\r\neach drachm. The dose of listerine which I have employed for an adult\r\nis one teaspoonful, considerably diluted with cold water. A child of\r\nfive years can take ten to fifteen drops every two to four hours. I\r\ncall the attention of the profession to the use of boracic acid as an\r\nantidote to the scarlatinous poison, without sufficient experience to\r\nenable me to speak positively of its efficacy, but with the hope and\r\nexpectation, from observing its apparent effects in seventeen families\r\nafflicted with scarlet fever, that it will be found a useful addition\r\nto our means of controlling this much-dreaded and fatal malady.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge the most reliable and certain\r\nprophylaxis is the isolation of patient and nurses, and the thorough\r\nand judicious employment of disinfectants upon their persons and in\r\nthe apartments. All furniture and articles not absolutely required\r\nshould be removed from the sick room, and no one should be allowed to\r\nenter it except the medical attendant and nurses. Constant ventilation\r\nshould be {538} insisted on by lowering the upper and raising the\r\nlower sash of the window two or three inches in mild weather. Even in\r\nstormy weather sufficient ventilation can be obtained in this way\r\nwithout exposing the patient to currents of air, which should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nSince the exhalations from the body, the various excretions, and the\r\nepidermic cells shed so abundantly in the desquamative period contain\r\nthe scarlatinous poison, measures should be employed to disinfect\r\nthem, in so far as the comfort and well-being of the patient will\r\nallow. Vessels which receive the excretions should contain carbolic\r\nacid, chloride of lime or other disinfectant, and they should be\r\nimmediately emptied and cleaned after use. By the frequent application\r\nof disinfecting washes to the nostrils and fauces the secretions from\r\nthese surfaces are to a great extent deprived of their contagiousness.\r\nIf otorrhoea occur, boracic acid, so serviceable in its treatment,\r\nacts as a disinfectant, but in addition the ear should be syringed\r\nwith warm carbolized water, one drachm of carbolic acid to the pint of\r\nwater, and this should be continued during convalescence, for cases\r\noccur which show that the discharge from the ear is probably the\r\nvehicle by which the virus is communicated. Even as late as the fourth\r\nweek after the disappearance of the rash children in scarlet fever\r\nexperience relief from inunction of the surface, and if carbolic acid\r\nbe added to the substance which is employed for this purpose, and the\r\ninunction be made twice daily over the entire surface, contamination\r\nof the air through the exfoliations and exhalations from the skin is\r\nin great part prevented. The late William Budd of Bristol, England,\r\nwas in the habit of recommending inunction of the surface twice daily\r\nwith sweet oil, which answered the purpose of preventing dissemination\r\nof epidermic particles through the air; and we will presently see how\r\nsuccessful were his precautionary measures.\r\n\r\nA convalescent child should not be allowed to mingle with other\r\nchildren till three or four weeks have elapsed and desquamation has\r\nceased; and all who are liable to take the malady should be excluded\r\nfrom the room in which a case has occurred for a longer period, and\r\nuntil it has been thoroughly disinfected by burning sulphur or other\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nThe New York Board of Health enforces the following excellent\r\nregulations to prevent the spread of scarlet fever as well as other\r\nacute infectious maladies:\r\n\r\n\"Care of Patients.--The patient should be placed in a separate room,\r\nand no person except the physician, nurse, or mother allowed to enter\r\nthe room or to touch the bedding or clothing used in the sick-room\r\nuntil they have been thoroughly disinfected.\r\n\r\n\"Infected Articles.--All clothing, bedding, or other articles not\r\nabsolutely necessary for the use of the patient should be removed from\r\nthe sick room. Articles used about the patients, such as sheets,\r\npillow-cases, blankets, or clothes, must not be removed from the sick\r\nroom until they have been disinfected by placing them in a tub with\r\nthe following disinfecting fluid; eight ounces of sulphate of zinc,\r\none ounce of carbolic acid, three gallons of water. They should be\r\nsoaked in this fluid for at least an hour, and then placed in boiling\r\nwater for washing.\r\n\r\n\"A piece of muslin one foot square should be dipped in the same\r\nsolution and suspended in the sick room constantly, and the same\r\nshould be done in the hallway adjoining the sick room.\r\n\r\n{539} \"All vessels used for receiving the discharges of patients\r\nshould have some of the same disinfecting fluid constantly therein,\r\nand immediately after being used by the patient should be emptied and\r\ncleansed with boiling water. Water-closets and privies should also be\r\ndisinfected daily with the same fluid or a solution of chloride of\r\niron, one pound to a gallon of water, adding one or two ounces of\r\ncarbolic acid.\r\n\r\n\"All straw beds should be burned.\r\n\r\n\"It is advised not to use handkerchiefs about the patients, but rather\r\nsoft rags, for cleansing the nostrils and mouth, which should be\r\nimmediately thereafter burned.\r\n\r\n\"The ceilings and side-walls of a sick-room after removal of the\r\npatient should be thoroughly cleaned and lime-washed, and the woodwork\r\nand floor thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water.\"\r\n\r\nBy such measures of prevention there can be no doubt that the number\r\nof cases of scarlet fever would be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nBudd for years recommended similar precautions in the families which\r\nhe attended, and the following is his testimony in regard to the\r\nresult: \"The success of this method in my own hands has been very\r\nremarkable. For a period of nearly twenty years, during which I have\r\nemployed it in a very wide field, I have never known the disease to\r\nspread beyond the sick-room in a single instance, and in very few\r\ninstances within it. Time after time I have treated this fever in\r\nhouses crowded from attic to basement with children and others, who\r\nhave nevertheless escaped infection. The two elements in the method\r\nare separation on the one hand, and disinfection on the other.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _British Medical Journal_, Jan. 9, 1869.]\r\n\r\nHYGIENIC TREATMENT.--The room occupied by a scarlatinous patient\r\nshould be commodious and sufficiently ventilated. Its temperature\r\nshould be uniform at about 70° during the course of the fever. When\r\nthe fever begins to abate and desquamation commences, a temperature of\r\n72° to 75° is preferable, so that there is less danger that the\r\nsurface may be chilled during unguarded moments, as at night, when the\r\nbody may be accidentally uncovered, since sudden cooling of the\r\nsurface at this time may cause nephritis or some other dangerous\r\ninflammation. Henoch does not believe in the theory that the nephritis\r\nis commonly produced by catching cold, but many observations show that\r\nthose who are carefully protected from vicissitudes of temperature,\r\nwho remain during convalescence in a warm room, and are protected by\r\nabundant clothing, more frequently escape this complication than such\r\nas are under no restraint of this kind and are carelessly exposed in\r\ntimes of changeable weather. Nevertheless, it is true that a certain\r\nproportion suffer from nephritis however judicious the after-treatment\r\nmay be. The best hygienic management does not always prevent its\r\noccurrence. The patient should not, therefore, leave the house until\r\nfour weeks after the beginning of the fever, and in inclement weather\r\nnot till a longer time has elapsed. So long as desquamation is going\r\non and the skin has not regained its normal function the patient\r\nshould remain indoor, and when finally he is allowed to leave the\r\nhouse he should be warmly clothed.\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT.--In order to treat scarlet fever successfully\r\nit is necessary to bear in mind that it is a self-limited disease,\r\nrunning for a certain time and through certain stages, and that it is\r\nnot {540} abbreviated by any known treatment. Therapeutic measures can\r\nonly moderate its symptoms and render it milder. The severity of the\r\ndisease is indicated by its symptoms, and the symptoms are to a\r\ncertain extent under our control.\r\n\r\nMILD CASES.--A patient with a temperature under 103°, and with only a\r\nmoderate angina, does not require active treatment, but, however light\r\nthe disease, he should always be in bed and in a room of uniform\r\ntemperature, as stated above. Instances have come to my notice in the\r\npoor families of New York in which scarlet fever was not\r\ndiagnosticated, and the patients were allowed to go about the house,\r\nand even in the open air, in the eruptive stage, till some severe\r\ncomplication or an aggravation of the type created alarm and medical\r\nadvice was sought, when it appeared that a grave and dangerous\r\ncondition had, through carelessness and ignorance, resulted from a\r\nmild and favorable form of the malady. The physician, when summoned to\r\na case however mild, should never fail to take the temperature, note\r\nthe pulse, inspect the fauces, and inquire in reference to the fecal\r\nand urinary evacuations, that he may detect early any unfavorable\r\nchanges which may occur.\r\n\r\nSince in all cases angina and more or less blood-deterioration are\r\npresent, the following prescription will be found useful in mild as\r\nwell as severe scarlet fever:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Potass. Chlorat.   drachm ii;\r\n      Tr. Ferri Chloridi fl. drachm ii;\r\n      Syrupi             fl. oz. iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. Half a teaspoonful every hour to two hours to a child of three\r\nyears; a teaspoonful to a child of six years.\r\n\r\nSmall doses of this medicine frequently administered act beneficially\r\non the surface of the throat and tend to prevent the anæmia which is\r\nso common after scarlet fever. If the medicine be given gradually\r\ndiluted with only a moderate amount of water, the effect is better on\r\nthe inflamed fauces. Potassium chlorate is known to be an irritant to\r\nthe kidneys in large doses, causing intense hyperæmia of these organs,\r\nwith bloody urine or suppression of urine. The melancholy fate of\r\nFountaine, who died from the effects of one ounce of this medicine, is\r\nknown to the profession. I have seen a similar instance in a child.\r\nBut doses of one to four grains, according to the age, can be\r\nadministered with safety to children, so that half a drachm to a\r\ndrachm and a half are taken in twenty-four hours. A quantity much\r\nexceeding this amount involves risk. In mild cases it is not necessary\r\nto treat the throat by topical measures, the above prescription\r\nproducing sufficient local effect, but camphorated oil may be used\r\nexternally. I ordinarily prescribe quinine in small doses for this\r\nform of scarlatina, as in the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Quiniæ Sulphat.       gr. xvi;\r\n      Ext. Glycyrrhizæ      scruple ss;\r\n      Syr. Pruni Virginianæ fl. oz. ii. M.\r\n\r\nS. One teaspoonful every fourth hour to a child of three to five\r\nyears, the potassium chlorate and iron mixture being administered\r\ntwice between.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of scarlatina by antiseptic remedies will be considered\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n{541} The itching and dryness of the surface, which increase the\r\ndiscomfort of the patient in mild as well as severe scarlatina, are\r\nrelieved by frequently anointing the whole body with vaseline, cold\r\ncream, or butter of cocoa. Carbolic acid is an efficient remedy for\r\npruritus, while it is also a disinfectant. It may be used in the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Carbolici drachm i;\r\n      Vaseline        oz. iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. To be applied over the entire surface.\r\n\r\nIn New York leaf lard has long been employed as an unguent over the\r\nentire surface in scarlet fever, and patients experience benefit from\r\nit. Alcohol and water or vinegar and water are sometimes employed for\r\nthe same purpose. The linen should be changed every day and the bed\r\nthoroughly aired.\r\n\r\nORDINARY CASES AND CASES OF SEVERE TYPE.--A safe temperature in\r\nscarlet fever may be considered at or below 103°. If it rise above\r\nthis, measures designed to abstract heat are very important--more\r\nimportant even in many cases than the medicinal agents which are\r\ncommonly used to combat this disease. Since a high temperature retards\r\nassimilation, promotes deleterious tissue-change, and causes rapid\r\nemaciation and loss of strength, measures designed to reduce it are\r\nurgently needed. \"The production of heat depends chiefly on oxidation\r\nof the constituents of the body\" (Billroth). Therefore fever indicates\r\nan increase of the oxidation and a molecular disintegration above the\r\nhealthy standard. Hence the augmentation of urea in the urine and the\r\nprogressive emaciation and loss of weight which characterize the\r\nfebrile state. Fever also diminishes the secretions by which food is\r\ndigested and destroys the appetite, so that repair of the waste is\r\ninsufficient. Moreover, a high temperature continuing for a time tends\r\nto produce degenerative changes, albuminous and fatty, in the tissues,\r\nthe more rapidly the higher the temperature, so that the functions of\r\norgans are seriously impaired. Among the most dangerous of the\r\ntissue-changes is granulo-fatty degeneration of the muscular fibres of\r\nthe heart. In dogs and rabbits that have perished from a high\r\ntemperature artificially produced by experimenters granular clouding\r\nof the elementary tissues has been found after death.[8] A high\r\ntemperature, therefore, in itself involves danger, and if it occur in\r\nan ataxic disease like scarlet fever, and be protracted, it greatly\r\ndiminishes the chances of a favorable issue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See experiments by Mr. J. W. Legg, _Lond. Path. Soc.\r\nTrans._, vol. xxiv., and others.]\r\n\r\nThe temperature can be reduced without shock or injury to the child by\r\nthe judicious use of cold water externally. The cold-water treatment\r\nis not necessary if the temperature be under 103°, though useful if\r\njudiciously employed by sponging when the temperature is at 102° or\r\n103°; but if it rise above 103° it is required, and the more urgently\r\nthe higher the temperature. The external use of cold water as an\r\nantipyretic in the febrile diseases is now almost universally\r\nrecommended by physicians, but it still meets with opposition on the\r\npart of families, especially in the treatment of the exanthematic\r\nfevers, and the directions for its employment are therefore not apt to\r\nbe fully carried out during the absence of the medical attendant. The\r\nold theory that the fevers require warmth and sweating has such a firm\r\nhold on the popular mind that some years longer will be required for\r\nits removal.\r\n\r\n{542} The modes of applying cold water recommended by cautious and\r\nexperienced physicians are various. Von Ziemssen recommended that the\r\npatient be immersed in water at a temperature of 90°, and cool water\r\nbe gradually added till the temperature fall to 77°. In a few minutes\r\nthe patient is returned to his bed, his surface dried, and he is\r\ncovered by the proper bed-clothes, when his temperature will probably\r\nbe found reduced two or two and a half degrees. If the patient\r\ncomplain of chillness or his pulse be feeble, he should be immediately\r\nremoved from the bath and stimulants administered, either whiskey or\r\nbrandy, for if the extremities remain cool and the capillary\r\ncirculation sluggish, the effect may be injurious, since some internal\r\ninflammation may arise to complicate the fever. Under such\r\ncircumstances increased alcoholic stimulation is required.\r\n\r\nThe cold pack is also effectual for reducing the temperature. The\r\npatient is placed upon a mattrass protected by oil-cloth, and is\r\ncovered by a sheet wrung out of water at a temperature of 70°. This is\r\ncovered by one or two blankets. In half an hour he is returned to bed,\r\nand will be found to have a temperature two or three degrees less than\r\nthat before the bath. Another method is to apply the sheet wrung out\r\nof water at 90°, and then reduce the temperature by adding water at a\r\nlower degree from a sprinkler. In most cases, however, I prefer to\r\nreduce the temperature by the constant application to the head of an\r\nindia-rubber bag containing ice. The bag should be about one-third\r\nfilled, so that it should fit over the head like a cap. At the same\r\ntime, as a potent means of abstracting heat, at least when the\r\ntemperature is at or above 104°, a similar application should be made\r\nby an elongated rubber bag lying over the neck and extending from ear\r\nto ear. Cold applied over the great vessels of the neck promptly\r\nabstracts heat from the blood, while it diminishes the pharyngitis,\r\nadenitis, and cellulitis; which is an important gain. At the same\r\ntime, it is proper to sponge frequently the hands and arms with cool\r\nwater. If the temperature with this treatment be not sufficiently\r\nreduced, one or two thicknesses of muslin frequently wrung out of\r\nice-water should be placed along the arms and upon either side of the\r\nface. By such local measures, which are agreeable to the patient and\r\nwithout any shock or perturbing effect on the system, we can reduce\r\nthe temperature two or three degrees. By adding alcohol or one of the\r\nalcoholic compounds to the water the popular objection to the use of\r\ncold is overcome.\r\n\r\nTrousseau, in the treatment of sthenic cases attended by a high\r\ntemperature, was in the habit of placing the patient naked in a\r\nbath-tub and directing three or four pailsful of water to be thrown\r\nover him in a space of time varying from one quarter of a minute to\r\none minute, after which he was returned to bed and covered by the\r\nbed-clothes without being dried. Reaction immediately occurred, often\r\nwith more or less perspiration. This treatment was repeated once or\r\ntwice daily, according to the gravity of the symptoms. Trousseau,\r\nalluding to this treatment, says: \"I have never administered it\r\nwithout deriving some benefit.\" But the application of cold water in a\r\nmanner that does not excite or frighten the patient seems preferable.\r\nHenoch, having a large experience, gives the following advice in\r\nreference to the water treatment: \"If the fever continue high and the\r\napparently malignant {543} symptoms described above develop, the head\r\nshould be covered with an ice-bag, ... and the child placed in a\r\nlukewarm bath, not under 25° R. (88.25° F.). I decidedly oppose cooler\r\nbaths, because in scarlatina, which presents a tendency to\r\nheart-failure, cold may produce an unexpected rapid collapse more than\r\nin any other affection. But I strongly recommend washing the entire\r\nbody every three hours with a sponge dipped in cool water and\r\nvinegar.\"[9] In grave cases with a high temperature the application of\r\ncold should be sufficient to produce a decided reduction of heat,\r\notherwise the full benefit from its use is not obtained. With proper\r\nstimulation and proper precautions prostration does not occur from the\r\nice-bags to the head and neck and cool sponging of other parts, so\r\nlong as the temperature does not fall below 102° or 103°. The danger\r\nalluded to by Henoch can only occur from the use of the pack or\r\ngeneral bath, and the water treatment can be efficiently carried out\r\nand the temperature sufficiently reduced without resorting to these.\r\nEven Currie of Edinburgh, who first drew attention to the benefit from\r\nthe cold-water treatment of scarlet fever in an age when the sweating\r\ntreatment, and even the exclusion of cool and fresh air from the\r\napartment, were deemed necessary, recommended cold affusion only in\r\nsthenic cases with full and strong pulse, and he mentions as a warning\r\ntwo cases with quick and feeble pulse and cool extremities in which\r\ndeath occurred immediately after the use of the water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Diseases of Children._]\r\n\r\nSodium salicylate is in some instances a useful remedy for the\r\nreduction of heat in the infectious diseases. It seems to be more\r\ndecidedly antipyretic than quinine in the febrile and inflammatory\r\ndiseases, though somewhat depressing to the heart's action. James\r\nCouldrey writes to the _London Lancet_ (Dec., 1882, p. 1064) that he\r\nhas derived great benefit from its use in seven cases of scarlet\r\nfever. He administered it every two hours till ringing in the ears was\r\nproduced, and afterward every four hours, prescribing one grain for\r\neach year in the age of the patient. It is, in my opinion, a proper\r\nremedy when the pulse is full and strong and the temperature is not\r\nsufficiently reduced by the cold-water treatment.\r\n\r\nAconite and veratrum viride reduce fever, but they are too depressing\r\nto be safely employed in grave scarlet fever, and their antipyretic\r\neffect is less than that of water. The use of digitalis might be\r\nsuggested by the quick and feeble pulse in certain cases that are\r\nattended by high temperature, but the judgment of the profession is\r\nfor the most part against its use in such cases. What Stillé and\r\nMaisch state of its employment in typhoid fever appears equally\r\napplicable to scarlet fever: \"Even its advocates have not shown that\r\nit abridges the disease or lessens its mortality, while it is\r\nabundantly demonstrated to impair the digestion, reduce the strength,\r\nand even to occasion sudden death. The use of digitalis in other forms\r\nof fever is equally unsatisfactory, and justifies the judgment of\r\nTraube, that the true field of action for digitalis is not fever.\"\r\n\r\nQuinine is the medicine which above all others has been heretofore\r\nmost used, by almost common consent of the profession, to reduce the\r\ntemperature in malignant scarlet fever, but its use for this purpose\r\nis, according to my observations, far from satisfactory. To obtain its\r\n{544} antipyretic action it must be administered in large doses, and\r\nif any of the quinine salts in ordinary use be administered by the\r\nmouth in sufficient quantity, they are apt to be vomited. To a child\r\nof five years five grains should be administered twice daily by the\r\nmouth, or ten grains of a soluble salt, as the bisulphate, may be\r\ngiven per rectum, dissolved in a little warm water. Administered per\r\nrectum, it is frequently not retained unless held for a time by a\r\nnapkin. A considerable proportion of the malignant cases are attended\r\nby not only irritability of the stomach, already alluded to, but by\r\ndiarrhoea, so that quinine, if administered at all, should be employed\r\nhypodermically. The double salt of quinia and urea answers for this\r\npurpose, as it is very soluble in water and does not produce\r\ninflammation of the connective tissue. When the antipyretic doses of\r\nquinine are discontinued, this agent may be prescribed as a tonic in\r\nthe doses recommended for the treatment of mild scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases with frequent and rapid pulse, in which ante-mortem\r\nheart-clots are apt to occur, the ammonium carbonate is often useful.\r\nIt should be dissolved in water and given in milk, in as large doses\r\nas five grains every hour or second hour to a child of five years. It\r\naids in producing stronger contraction of the cardiac muscular fibres,\r\nand thus diminishes the danger of the formation of thrombi. Ten-drop\r\ndoses of the aromatic spirits of ammonia may be employed instead of\r\nthe carbonate, given in sweetened water. It is especially useful if\r\nthe stomach be irritable.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases attended by considerable angina and foul and offensive\r\nsecretions upon the faucial surface an antiseptic, as boracic acid in\r\nsmall quantity, should be added to the potash and iron mixture\r\nrecommended above. If no drink be allowed for a few minutes after the\r\ndose, so as not to wash it too soon from the fauces, the antiseptic\r\neffect is more certainly produced. Those old enough should be directed\r\nto hold the medicine for a moment like a gargle in the throat before\r\nswallowing it. I employ boracic acid by preference, as in the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acid. Boracic.     drachm ss;\r\n      Potass. Chlorat.   drachm ii;\r\n      Tr. Ferri Chloridi fl. drachm ii;\r\n      Glycerinæ,\r\n      Syrupi       _aa._ fl. oz. i;\r\n      Aquæ               fl. oz. ii. M.\r\n\r\nS. Give one tablespoonful every two hours to a child of five years.\r\n\r\nMore minute directions will presently be given for the treatment of\r\nthe pharyngitis when we speak of the complications.\r\n\r\nAlcohol, whether administered in one of the stronger wines, as sherry,\r\nor in whisky or brandy, is a most useful remedy in scarlet fever, and\r\nis indeed indispensable in all grave cases which are attended by\r\nfeeble capillary circulation and evidences of prostration. Milk is\r\nalso the best vehicle for this agent. The wine-whey or milk-punch\r\nshould be given every hour or second hour. In scarlet fever, as well\r\nas diphtheria, comparatively large doses are required, as a\r\nteaspoonful of the stimulant every hour or second hour for a child of\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence the hygienic treatment already described is\r\nimportant. Nutritious diet and a moderate amount of alcoholic {545}\r\nstimulants are required, while the patient is kept indoors and\r\nprotected from currents of air as long as desquamation is occurring.\r\nMore or less anæmia is present in most convalescent patients, so that\r\na mild tonic containing iron will aid in restoring the health. Elixir\r\nof calisaya-bark and iron; preparations of beef, iron, and wine, or\r\nthe following prescription, will be found useful under such\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Ferri et Ammon. Citrat.,\r\n      Ammon. Carbonat.   _aa._ gr. xxiv;\r\n      Syrupi                   fl. oz. i;\r\n      Aquæ                     fl. oz. ii. M.\r\n\r\nS. Dose, one or two teaspoonfuls, according to the age, every third\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nANTISEPTIC TREATMENT.--It is still to be determined whether or to what\r\nextent antiseptics, administered internally, antagonize and control\r\nthe scarlatinous poison, and are therefore curative of scarlet fever.\r\nThe most important agent of this class, carbolic acid, can only be\r\nemployed in small doses, for a dose much exceeding a drop for a child,\r\nor even exceeding a fractional part of a drop for a young child, might\r\nproduce poisonous symptoms. Carbolic acid is a cardiac and arterial\r\nsedative, and it appears to reduce temperature. Intra-uterine\r\ninjections of carbolized water in the treatment of puerperal fever are\r\nknown to reduce temperature, even when there is no septic matter in\r\nthe uterus to be disinfected and washed away, as in a case related to\r\nme in which the fever proved to be due to measles. It is not\r\nimprobable that the antipyretic action in patients of this class who\r\nhave no septic substance within the uterus is due largely, if not\r\nmainly, to the absorption of carbolic acid from the uterine surface\r\nand its sedative action on the vascular system. Whether this agent, so\r\nhighly extolled by Declat, and to which I have alluded in a preceding\r\npage, can be safely employed in doses large enough to be efficient and\r\ncurative will be determined by future observations. The same remark is\r\napplicable to the sulphocarbolate of sodium, whose antiseptic action\r\nis supposed to be due, as already stated, to the liberation of\r\ncarbolic acid in the system. Since boracic acid does not seem to have\r\nany deleterious action, this agent has been administered to most of my\r\nscarlatinous patients during the last year, in addition to the older\r\nand better known remedies, and with a very small percentage of deaths.\r\nWhat may be the result in a more severe type of the disease remains to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--Local measures designed to\r\ndiminish or cure the pharyngitis are important in all but the mildest\r\ncases. They are more especially required in the anginose variety and\r\nin those not infrequent cases in which diphtheria complicates\r\nscarlatina. Formerly it was necessary, in making applications to the\r\nfauces, to employ the brush or probang for those too young to use the\r\ngargle, but hand-atomizers, as Richardson's or Delano's, which are now\r\nin common use, afford a quick and easy method for making such\r\napplications. Six or eight compressions of the bulb of a good atomizer\r\nare sufficient to cover the fauces with the spray. Those\r\nhand-atomizers in the shops which have slender metallic points are apt\r\nto prick the buccal surface and cause bleeding if the child resist and\r\ntoss the head. To prevent this, I am in the habit of directing\r\nindia-rubber tubing to be drawn over the point in such a way as not to\r\nobstruct its action. The following will be found useful mixtures for\r\nthe atomizer: For ordinary cases, {546}\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Carbolici  drachm ss, vel. Acid. Boracic. drachm ii;\r\n      Potass. Chlorat. drachm ii;\r\n      Glycerinæ        fl. oz. ii;\r\n      Aquæ             fl. oz. vi. M.\r\n\r\nIf the surface of the throat be covered by foul secretions,\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Carbolici  drachm ss;\r\n      Potass. Chlorat. drachm ii;\r\n      Glycerinæ        fl. oz. j;\r\n      Aquæ Calcis      fl. oz. vii. M.\r\n\r\nOr else,\r\n\r\n  Rx. Tinc.

It should be applied by a large camel's-hair pencil every\r\nthree to six hours:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Carbolici         gtt. x;\r\n      Liq. Ferri Subsulphatis fl. drachm ii;\r\n      Glycerinæ               fl. oz. i. M.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of scarlatinous pharyngitis sufficiently severe to\r\nrequire special treatment, cool applications should be made over the\r\nneck from ear to ear, as by two thicknesses of muslin frequently\r\nsqueezed out of cold water, or by the elongated india-rubber bag\r\nalready recommended in our remarks relating to methods to reduce\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of scarlet fever the coryza is slight, and no\r\ndischarge from the nostrils occurs, so that no local treatment is\r\nrequired; but before the termination of the malady, in cases of\r\nordinary gravity, a nasal discharge usually supervenes, producing more\r\nor less redness and {547} excoriating the upper lip. Moreover, in\r\nlocalities where diphtheria occurs, if this malady complicate scarlet\r\nfever, it is apt to affect the nostrils at the same time that the\r\nfauces are invaded. These conditions require local treatment of the\r\nnares. It should be remembered that the Schneiderian membrane is\r\nmidway in sensitiveness, as it is in location, between the\r\nconjunctival and buccal surfaces, and is readily irritated by strong\r\napplications. Medicinal applications made to it must be much milder\r\nthan those which the fauces tolerate. They should always be applied\r\nwarm, and a teaspoonful of any mixture properly employed is sufficient\r\nfor each nostril at one sitting. The applications should usually be\r\nmade every two or four hours, according to the gravity of the case and\r\nthe amount of discharge. The best instrument for this purpose is a\r\nsmall syringe of glass or brass with curved neck and bulbous tip. The\r\nchild's head should be thrown back and the piston depressed rapidly,\r\nso as to thoroughly wash out the nasal cavity. The application can\r\nalso be made through an atomizer with a rounded tip or a tip covered\r\nby rubber tubing. The following is a useful prescription:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Carbolici drachm ss;\r\n      Sodii Chloridi  drachm ii;\r\n      Aquæ            Oj.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of 2 or 3 drachms of boracic acid in place of the\r\ncarbolic acid makes a nicer preparation. If the diphtheritic\r\npseudo-membrane appear in the nares, the officinal lime-water,\r\ninjected every hour or second hour, is beneficial in consequence of\r\nits solvent action on pseudo-membranes.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from what has been stated above, that the condition of\r\nthe ear should be closely observed in and after scarlet fever. If the\r\npatient have earache, considerable relief may be obtained in the\r\ncommencement by dropping a few drops of laudanum and sweet oil into\r\nthe ear and covering it by some hot application, either dry or moist,\r\nwhich will retain the heat. A light bag containing common table-salt,\r\nheated, or dry and hot chamomile flowers will also answer the purpose.\r\nWater as hot as can be well tolerated dropped into the ear or allowed\r\nto trickle from a fountain syringe, so as to fill the ear, is also\r\nvery beneficial in allaying the pain. If a few drops of laudanum be\r\nadded it is more useful. If the pain be not quickly relieved, a leech\r\nshould be applied at the base of the tragus. O. D. Pomeroy, an\r\nexperienced aurist of New York, says: \"Leeching employed at the right\r\ntime rarely fails to subdue the pain and inflammation. The posterior\r\nface of the tragus is ordinarily the best place for applying the\r\nleech, but it may be applied in front of the ear or behind, wherever\r\nthe tenderness on pressure is greatest. In my opinion, paracentesis\r\nmay frequently be rendered unnecessary by the timely use of one or two\r\nleeches applied to the meatus.\"\r\n\r\nIf the otitis continue, as shown by pain in the ear, of which children\r\nold enough to speak bitterly complain, and which causes those too\r\nyoung to speak to press their fingers into or against their ears, this\r\ninflammation should not be neglected, as it may involve serious\r\nconsequences. Multitudes of children have had permanent impairment or\r\neven loss of hearing, with caries or necrosis of the walls of the\r\nmiddle ear and of the mastoid cells, which might have been prevented\r\nby prompt and skilful {548} management of the ear in the early stage\r\nof the inflammation. If, therefore, the otitis continue without\r\nmitigation of pain after the above measures have been employed,\r\nparacentesis of the drumhead is probably required. The following\r\ndirections for performing this operation, which will be useful to\r\ncountry practitioners who may not be able to obtain the assistance of\r\na specialist, are from the pen of Pomeroy: \"The forehead mirror should\r\nbe worn, in order to leave the hands free to operate by either\r\nartificial or day light. A good-sized speculum is introduced into the\r\nmeatus. Then an ordinary broad needle, about one line in diameter,\r\nwith a shank of about two inches, such as oculists use for puncturing\r\nthe cornea, should be held between the thumb and fingers, lightly\r\npressed, so as not to dull delicate tactile sensibility. The part\r\nbeing well under light, the most bulging portion of the membrane\r\nshould be lightly and quickly punctured with a very slight amount of\r\nforce. The posterior and superior portion of the membrane is most\r\nlikely to bulge. The chordæ tympani nerve ordinarily lies too high up\r\nto be wounded. The ossicles are avoided by selecting a posterior\r\nportion of the membrane. After puncture the ear should be inflated by\r\nan ear-bag whose nozzle is inserted into a nostril, both nostrils\r\nbeing closed, so as to force the fluid from the tympanum. The puncture\r\nmay need to be repeated at intervals of a day or two, provided that\r\nthe pain and bulging return.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert H. Buck of New York, in a highly instructive paper read before\r\nthe International Medical Congress in 1876, writes as follows of\r\nparacentesis of the membrana tympani in scarlatinous otitis: \"In this\r\none slight operation, which in itself is neither dangerous nor very\r\npainful, lies the power to prevent the whole train of disagreeable and\r\ndangerous symptoms.\" Buck relates an instructive example: The age of\r\nthe patient was three years, and the earache had been complained of\r\nonly about twenty-four hours. \"Toward morning,\" says he, \"I was sent\r\nfor, as the pain had become constant.... An examination with the\r\nspeculum and reflected light showed an oedematous and bulging membrana\r\ntympani (posterior half), the neighboring parts being very red, though\r\nas yet but little swollen. In the most prominent portion of the\r\nmembrane I made an incision scarcely three millimetres (one-tenth\r\ninch) in length, and involving simply the different layers of the\r\nmembrana tympani. This was almost immediately followed by a watery\r\ndischarge (without the aid of inflation), which ran down over the\r\nchild's cheek. At the end of three or four minutes the child had\r\nceased crying, and in less than a quarter of an hour she was fast\r\nasleep. At first, the discharge was very abundant and mainly watery in\r\ncharacter, but it steadily diminished in quantity and became thicker,\r\ntill finally, on the fourth day, it ceased altogether. On the tenth\r\nday the most careful examination of the ear could not detect any trace\r\nof either the inflammation or the artificial opening.\" The ear had\r\nprobably been saved from ulceration of the drum membrane,\r\nlong-continued suppurative otitis, and perhaps from permanent\r\nimpairment of hearing.\r\n\r\nWhen an opening has been made in the membrana tympani either by\r\nincision or ulceration, it is advisable in some instances to inflate\r\nthe tympanum by Politzer's method, which has been alluded to above.\r\nThe nozzle of an india-rubber bag, with a flexible tube attached, is\r\nintroduced into the nostril on the affected side, and both nostrils\r\nare compressed {549} against it. The patient fills his mouth with\r\nwater, which he swallows at a given signal, as after the words one,\r\ntwo, three, spoken by the operator. During the act of swallowing,\r\nwhich opens the Eustachian tube, the rubber bag is forcibly\r\ncompressed, which forces the air along the tube into the middle ear\r\nand facilitates the escape of the pent-up secretions in the tympanic\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nIf the otitis have continued unchecked by treatment until the\r\nsecretions within it, after days and nights of suffering, have escaped\r\nby ulceration through the drumhead, the opportunity for prompt and\r\ncertain cure is passed. Still, the patient under these circumstances\r\nmay quickly recover, or there may be the other alternative described\r\nabove, in which the ear is badly damaged and chronic inflammation\r\nestablished in the walls of the tympanum, giving rise to an offensive\r\notorrhoea. In this state of the ear internal remedies are indicated,\r\nsuch as surgeons employ in suppurative inflammations of bone occurring\r\nin other parts of the system. Cod-liver oil and iodide of iron are\r\nrequired, especially by patients of strumous diathesis, the object\r\nbeing to promote a more healthy state of system, so as to prevent\r\nextension of the inflammation and facilitate the healing process.\r\nCarbolized solutions, as the following, syringed warm into the ear in\r\nwhich otorrhoea is occurring, are useful in promoting cleanliness and\r\nincreasing the comfort of the patient:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Carbolici drachm ss;\r\n      Glycerinæ       fl. oz. ii;\r\n      Aquæ            fl. oz. iv. M.\r\n\r\nBut recently a much more effectual curative agent for local treatment\r\nhas been discovered in boracic acid, by the use of which the discharge\r\nmore quickly diminishes and the condition of the ear more certainly\r\nand rapidly improves than by the use of the carbolized mixtures. When\r\nthe inflammation is recent and the ear sensitive and painful, the\r\nfollowing prescription should be used:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Boracici   drachm iiss;\r\n      Morphiæ Sulphat. gr. i;\r\n      Glycerinæ,\r\n      Aquæ       _aa._ fl. oz. i. M.\r\n\r\nS. Drop one to three drops into the ear three times daily.\r\n\r\nIf the acute stage of the otitis have passed, with fever and pain, and\r\nno tenderness be present on pressure, the following prescription,\r\nwhich causes too much pain in the acute stage, will be found useful to\r\ncheck the inflammation and otorrhoea and restore a healthy state to\r\nthe granulating surface:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acidi Boracici drachm iiss;\r\n      Alcohol.\r\n      Aquæ     _aa._ fl. oz. i.\r\n\r\nS. Drop one to three drops into the ear three times daily.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects observed from the use of boracic acid in aural\r\nsurgery have given it nearly the same position as a curative agent to\r\ndiseases of the ear which atropine holds to diseases of the eye.\r\nRecently, aurists are employing finely-triturated powder of boracic\r\nacid dusted into the ear. The patient lies upon the side with the\r\naffected ear uppermost. The ear is thoroughly cleaned by syringing\r\nwith tepid water, and by means of a little scoop made of stiff paper\r\nor pasteboard or the segment {550} of quill as much of the powder is\r\nintroduced into the ear as would cover a five-cent silver piece. By\r\nworking the ear it descends to the drumhead. I can bear witness to its\r\nefficacy in the otorrhoea of children when it is used in this manner\r\nthree times daily.\r\n\r\nThe following astringent has also been employed with good results for\r\nthe otorrhoea resulting from scarlet fever as well as from other\r\ncauses:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Zinci Sulphatis,\r\n      Aluminis   _aa._ gr. v;\r\n      Aquæ             fl. oz. i. M.\r\n\r\nA few drops of this should be dropped into the ear, or, if the ear be\r\nsensitive and painful, five drops should be added to a teaspoonful of\r\nwarm water and dropped or syringed into the ear.\r\n\r\nBut in recent times aurists have discovered a remedy superior to the\r\nabove in iodoform, the action of which is safe and efficient for\r\nprotracted otorrhoea with granulations, and it is superseding to a\r\ngreat extent the agents heretofore used in the treatment of this\r\ndisease. The ear should first be thoroughly cleaned by syringing with\r\nwarm water and dried, and iodoform, to which a little balsam of Peru\r\nis added to cover the disagreeable odor, should be pressed down to the\r\nbottom of the auditory canal by any convenient instrument. It is\r\nanodyne, astringent, and disinfectant, and should be employed in a dry\r\nstate in considerable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe sequelæ of otitis media, such as granulations sprouting out from\r\nthe drumhead, some of which may be of large size and are known as\r\npolypi, may require treatment by the aurist. A polypus may sometimes\r\nbe removal by the forceps or better by the snare. Polypi not large and\r\nfavorably located can sometimes be cured by an astringent powder, as\r\niodoform, sulphate of zinc, or alum, or by applying the liquid\r\nsubsulphate of iron. The otitis externa produced by the irritating\r\ndischarge which flows from the middle ear soon disappears when the\r\nflow ceases.\r\n\r\nThe renal affection, which, as we have seen, so often commences in the\r\ndeclining period of scarlet fever or during convalescence in mild as\r\nwell as severe cases, is frequently more dangerous than the primary\r\ndisease. It largely increases the percentage of deaths. A clear\r\nappreciation of its therapeutic requirements is important, since by\r\njudicious treatment many recover who would inevitably be sacrificed by\r\nimproper measures. The family should be informed that the danger from\r\nscarlet fever does not cease with the decline of the eruption, and\r\nthat the kidneys may become seriously affected by too early exposure\r\nof the patient to currents of air or sudden changes of temperature, by\r\nwhich cutaneous transpiration is checked. He should therefore be kept\r\nindoors in a comfortable and uniform temperature three or four weeks\r\nafter the termination of the fever, until desquamation has entirely\r\nceased and the new epiderm is sufficiently thick and firm to protect\r\nthe surface. During the changeable temperature of the autumnal,\r\nwinter, and spring months even longer confinement at home may be\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nThe nephritis and consequent albuminuria antedate by some days the\r\noccurrence of dropsy, and a physician should never discharge a\r\nscarlatinous patient without one or more examinations of his urine.\r\nWhen his visits cease the nurse should be instructed to make the\r\nexaminations by heat and nitric acid during the ensuing month, and if\r\nany evidence, however slight, appear that the kidneys are involved, he\r\nshould be notified, {551} in order that appropriate treatment may be\r\nimmediately commenced. Early and correct treatment of the nephritis is\r\nattended by much better results than delayed treatment, and many more\r\npatients are doubtless now saved than in former times, when little\r\nattention was given to the state of the kidneys until dropsy or other\r\nprominent symptoms appeared. I have found no mother or nurse so\r\nignorant that she could not properly employ the test of nitric acid\r\nand heat, and, if she be solicitous for the welfare of the child, she\r\nwill not hesitate to carry out the directions and immediately notify\r\nthe physician if the tests employed produce the least cloudiness or\r\nturbidity of the urine.\r\n\r\nThe patient as soon as nephritis commences, as shown by the state of\r\nthe urine, should be put to bed in a room of warm and equable\r\ntemperature (72° to 75° F.). His diet should be liquid, consisting of\r\nmilk, farinaceous food, and a moderate quantity of animal broths. He\r\nmay drink liquids freely, especially water not too cool, to which\r\nspiritus ætheris nitrosi is added. If he be prostrated by the primary\r\ndisease, alcoholic stimulants should be allowed.\r\n\r\nThe indications are to relieve the hyperæmic kidneys by diaphoresis\r\nand purgation. To produce the former the patient should be immersed in\r\na warm bath at about the temperature of the body (98° to 100°), in\r\nwhich, if he be quiet and comfortable, he should remain from fifteen\r\nto twenty minutes, but if restless and frightened by the water a less\r\ntime, after which he should be placed in a warm bed and well covered\r\nby blankets. If perspiration result, the bath has been useful, and it\r\nmay be employed in grave cases two or three times daily. If\r\nperspiration do not result, it may be produced by surrounding the body\r\neither by hot dry or moist air. Hot dry air may be produced by burning\r\nalcohol in a thin layer upon a plate under a chair upon which the\r\npatient sits while he is surrounded by a blanket, or he may be covered\r\nin bed and the hot air introduced under the bed-clothes. In New York a\r\nconvenient apparatus is used for this purpose, consisting of a small\r\nsheet-iron pipe enclosed in a small box of the same material. The box\r\nis in the form of a trunk, with a handle for convenience in carrying,\r\nand the lower end of the pipe, which extends nearly to the floor,\r\ncontains an alcohol lamp. Hot moist air may be produced by placing\r\nagainst the patient bottles of hot water surrounded by towels wrung\r\nout of water. The steam arising from them and enveloping the body and\r\nlimbs produces a prompt sudorific effect. There is in use in this\r\ncity, in the treatment of these and similar cases requiring\r\ndiaphoresis, a convenient apparatus for generating steam. It consists\r\nof a cylinder pierced with holes for the admission of air and\r\ncontaining a spirit lamp, over which is a pan or pail holding a little\r\nwater. The patient, nearly naked, is placed in a chair with the\r\napparatus underneath, and is covered by a blanket, so that the steam\r\nsurrounds the body. This gives rise to free perspiration, which\r\ncontinues after the patient is placed in bed. This treatment should be\r\nrepeated one or more times daily, according to the gravity of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe sudorific effect of the treatment by external warmth described\r\nabove should be aided by employing diaphoretics. Those which have been\r\nmost used are the acetates of ammonium and potassium, the bitartrate\r\nand citrate of potassium, and spiritus ætheris nitrosi. If employed\r\nwhen the surface is cool, they act rather as diuretics than\r\ndiaphoretics. {552} These agents, being simple in their action and\r\nwithout deleterious effects, may be given frequently and in large\r\nproportionate doses for the age.\r\n\r\nBut lately a diaphoretic which far surpasses these in efficiency has\r\nbeen discovered in pilocarpine, the active principle of jaborandi.\r\nBeing soluble in water and tasteless, it is easily administered, and\r\nis retained when, on account of the uræmic poisoning present in\r\nscarlatinous nephritis, the stomach is irritable and other medicines,\r\nas digitalis, are rejected. Ether may be employed with it, or the\r\namount of alcoholic stimulant may be increased at the time of its\r\nexhibition in order to guard against any depressing effect. To a child\r\nof two years one-fortieth to one-twentieth of a grain may be given\r\nevery six hours by the mouth. It may also be employed hypodermically,\r\nas one-twentieth of a grain to a child of five years. It has both a\r\ndiaphoretic and diuretic action, while it stimulates both the salivary\r\nand mucous secretions. According to one observer, an adult when fully\r\nunder the influence of pilocarpine secretes from one pint to one quart\r\nof saliva within two hours, and Leyden reports a case of diphtheritic\r\nnephritis in which the quantity of urine rose from half a pint to five\r\npints daily. But its most prompt and certain action is upon the\r\nsweat-glands. Hirschfelder speaks of its beneficial action in\r\nrelieving various forms of dropsy, and adds: \"In one morbid condition\r\nof the kidney, however, jaborandi is the remedy par excellence, and\r\nthat is the acute parenchymatous nephritis which frequently follows\r\nscarlatina.... This disease heals spontaneously if the danger that\r\nthreatens life from reduction of the urine and from the effusions of\r\nfluid into the cavities of the body be averted. In this disease\r\njaborandi works wonders.\" I have also found it an invaluable agent\r\nwhen the older remedies failed and death seemed imminent. The\r\nfollowing cases, in which the beneficial action of this agent was\r\napparent, occurred in my practice:\r\n\r\n_Case 8._--G----, male, aged five years and six months, sickened with\r\nscarlet fever on June 2, 1882. It began with vomiting, and was\r\nattended by a degree of febrile movement which indicated an attack of\r\nrather more than the average gravity. The fauces at one time exhibited\r\na slight exudation like that of diphtheria. In the declining stage of\r\nthe malady rheumatic pain and tenderness occurred in the wrist and\r\nfinger-joints, but not in those of the lower extremities. The case,\r\nhowever, progressed favorably, and during the convalescence my\r\nattendance ceased. On June 24th my attention was again called to the\r\nchild, when the urine was found to be scanty and very albuminous.\r\nExternal measures, such as are described in the foregoing pages, were\r\nemployed, and the infusion of digitalis with potassium acetate ordered\r\nto be given every three hours, but this medicine was for the most part\r\nvomited. The bowels were kept open by jalap and the potassium\r\nbitartrate. The urine, however, continued scanty, and on June 28th\r\nsevere convulsions occurred. At this time the quantity of urine was\r\nonly fl. oz. ij in twenty-four hours. The pulse in the convulsions was\r\nquick and feeble, the skin very hot, and the axillary temperature\r\n103°. The eclampsia continued one hour, and were controlled by large\r\nand repeated doses of bromide of potassium, aided by clysters of five\r\ngrains of hydrate of chloral in water. Muriate of pilocarpine was now\r\ndirected to be given in doses of one-thirty-second of a grain every\r\nthree hours, dissolved in cold water. This agent was not vomited, and\r\nit must have been given by the parents in their fright and {553}\r\nanxiety in larger or more frequent doses than were directed, for on\r\nJuly 1st the bottle containing one grain was empty. Free diaphoresis\r\nresulted from the pilocarpine, and the quantity of urine was\r\nincreased. The mother stated that the child had taken only two doses,\r\nor one-sixteenth of a grain, of pilocarpine when the diuretic effect\r\nwas apparent and free diaphoresis also occurred. She also stated\r\nsubsequently that the quantity of urine was larger when the\r\npilocarpine was administered every third hour than when given at a\r\nlonger interval. A flaxseed poultice on which mustard was dusted was\r\nalso applied over the kidneys. On June 29th the pulse was 96,\r\ntemperature 100.5°; occasional convulsive attacks occurred, which were\r\nreadily controlled by enemata of hydrate of chloral. On June 30th the\r\nsymptoms were all better; no more attacks of eclampsia had occurred,\r\nand the urine was more abundant and less albuminous. The mother\r\nremarked that the new medicine (pilocarpine) had settled the stomach\r\nand increased the urine. The patient continued to improve, and on July\r\n4th the record states: \"Now takes the pilocarpine, gr. 1/32, every six\r\nhours; passes urine freely since yesterday; has not vomited since he\r\nbegan to take the pilocarpine; pulse 106, axillary temperature 99°; is\r\nplayful and takes milk freely, nearly three quarts in twenty-four\r\nhours, with some farinaceous food. Digitalis with potassium acetate is\r\nalso given in occasional doses.\" July 6th, pulse 92, temperature 99°;\r\nperspires much, and urine nearly normal in quantity and character.\r\n\r\n_Case 9._--Mary S----, aged five years, on Dec. 22, 1882, presented\r\nthe symptoms of severe nephritis. Her brother had scarlet fever two\r\nweeks previously, and she had sore throat at about the same time, but\r\nwithout efflorescence; pulse 98, temperature 98.5°; her urine highly\r\nalbuminous, and reduced to fl. oz. iv in twenty-four hours; bowels\r\nconstipated. Ordered a single dose of\r\n\r\n  Rx. Hydrarg. Chlor. Mitis gr. iii;\r\n      Resin. Podophylli     gr. 1/6. M.\r\n\r\nThe muriate of pilocarpine was also ordered, gr. 1/20, but the patient\r\nvomited soon after taking it. Another dose was retained, and was\r\nfollowed by considerable perspiration. Dec. 23d, had one stool from\r\nthe powder of yesterday. Has taken five doses of pilocarpine, but\r\nvomited after three of them. The last dose was administered at 10\r\nP.M., and the mother says she \"sweat fearfully\" during the night. The\r\npatient was kept warm in bed; stimulating poultices of mustard and\r\nflaxseed, one to sixteen, were constantly in use over the kidneys, and\r\nthe pilocarpine was administered three or four times a day. The record\r\nfor Dec. 26 states: \"Took the pilocarpine four times since yesterday\r\nmorning, and each dose is followed by perspiration lasting from one to\r\none and a half hours; quantity of urine, from fl. oz. vj to fl. oz.\r\nviij daily; vomited twice yesterday, not to-day; pulse 104,\r\ntemperature 97.75°; complains of frontal headache; bowels regular; has\r\nconsiderable salivation. The patient is warm in bed, and the flaxseed\r\nand mustard poultice over the kidneys is continued.\" Dec. 28th,\r\nspecific gravity of urine 1019; urine still quite albuminous, and\r\ncontaining blood-corpuscles and granular casts, also crystals of\r\noxalate of lime. Dec. 30th, takes gr. 1/20 pilocarpine twice daily,\r\nand occasional doses of infusion of digitalis; urine more abundant;\r\nits specific gravity 1014, slightly albuminous, and containing {554}\r\nvery few granular casts and blood-corpuscles; has lost its smoky\r\nappearance; reaction alkaline; perspiration slight; patient\r\nconvalescent.\r\n\r\nIn another instance, a child of five years, from three to four weeks\r\nafter scarlet fever was noticed to have anasarca of the face and\r\nextremities, with scanty and albuminous urine. One-thirty-second of a\r\ngrain of muriate of pilocarpine was administered every six hours\r\nwithout the desired sudorific effect. It was then administered every\r\nfour hours, with an increase of perspiration and urination, so that\r\nthe nephritic symptoms were relieved and the patient apparently out of\r\ndanger within three or four days.\r\n\r\nIn a fourth patient, a girl of three years, having scarlatinous\r\nnephritis, with symptoms very similar to those in the last case, the\r\nadministration of one-twentieth grain doses of pilocarpine in\r\nconjunction with the hot-air bath, was followed by increased\r\nperspiration and urination, and progressive and rather rapid\r\nconvalescence. This child had been taking bichloride of mercury in\r\none-fiftieth grain doses, prescribed by a homoeopathic physician,\r\nwithout appreciable benefit. It had been for the most part vomited.\r\n\r\nGiven, as in the above cases, in moderate doses and with sufficient\r\ninterval, pilocarpine has never in my practice had any deleterious\r\neffect, and I regard it as a very important addition to the remedies\r\nfor the relief of scarlatinous nephritis. It is apparently the most\r\nuseful and important diaphoretic for this disease which we possess.\r\n\r\nCathartics, especially those of a hydragogue nature, are also very\r\nbeneficial. Their action is more certain than that of most\r\ndiaphoretics and diuretics, and their employment is imperatively\r\nrequired in severe or dangerous cases in which it is necessary to\r\nremove as soon as possible the serum or urea which endangers life.\r\nYoung children or those with delicate stomach, and those much\r\nenfeebled by the primary disease, may take magnesia, either the\r\ncitrate or the calcined. A good cathartic for ordinary cases is a\r\nmixture of jalap and potassium bitartrate, the pulvis jalapæ\r\ncompositus, consisting of one part of jalap and two of cream of\r\ntartar. Ten grains of the mixture may be given to a child of five\r\nyears, and repeated according to circumstances. Its effect is\r\nincreased by dissolving a teaspoonful of potassium bitartrate in a\r\ngobletful of water, and allowing the patient to drink from it. The\r\nfollowing is a good cathartic in some instances, especially if the\r\nstomach be irritable, so that the more bulky and nauseating cathartics\r\nare rejected. Care should be taken to obtain a good article, as some\r\nof the podophyllin of the shops is not reliable:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Resinæ Podophylli gr. j;\r\n      Sacchari          scruple j. M.\r\n      Ft. in chart. No. v.-x.\r\n\r\nS. Give one powder, and repeat according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of one of the cases reported above it will be\r\nrecollected that the mild chloride of mercury mite was given with the\r\npodophyllin, with a good result.\r\n\r\nAfter the use of laxative agents the kidneys, being less congested on\r\naccount of the diversion that has occurred, often begin to excrete\r\nurine more freely. But if the patient be anæmic or enfeebled and the\r\nsymptoms are not urgent, it is frequently better to avoid active\r\ncatharsis, which {555} more or less reduces the strength, and employ\r\nremedies of a sustaining character, as in the following case, which\r\noccurred in my practice: A little boy, pallid and scrofulous, began to\r\nhave anasarca after scarlet fever, chiefly in the scrotum, accompanied\r\nby a moderate degree of ascites. The urine, which was passed in nearly\r\nthe normal quantity, contained albumen, but not in large amount. This\r\npatient gradually and fully recovered, with no treatment except the\r\nuse of an oil-silk jacket over the kidneys and abdomen to promote\r\ndiaphoresis, and the use of iron. Such a patient, treated by the\r\npowerful eliminatives which we employ for the more urgent and robust\r\ncases, would probably have been injured rather than benefited. No\r\ntreatment can therefore be recommended in a treatise on scarlatinous\r\nnephritis which will be strictly applicable for all cases. Variations\r\nare demanded according to the state of the patient and the form and\r\ngravity of the disease.\r\n\r\nDiuretics which do not stimulate the kidneys are proper at an early as\r\nwell as late period of the renal malady, and digitalis is the one\r\nusually prescribed. I do not hesitate to order it from the first day\r\nin combination with the acetate of potassium. One teaspoonful of the\r\ninfusion may be given every third hour to a child of five years. The\r\nfollowing formula is for one of this age in good general condition:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Potass. Acetatis oz. ss;\r\n      Infus. Digitalis fl. oz. vi.

M.\r\n\r\nDose, a teaspoonful every two or three hours to children two or three\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nLocal treatment is important. L. Thomas, Romberg, and others recommend\r\nthe application of leeches, three or more, over the kidneys. Thomas\r\nsays: \"In many cases the abstraction of blood causes immediate and\r\npermanent relief; the fever and the pain in the region of the kidneys\r\ncease, the secretion of urine becomes augmented, the albuminuria\r\nlessens from day to day, and the moderate degree of dropsy that has\r\nbeen developed disappears.\" It is only in the more robust children,\r\nwho have been but little reduced by the primary disease, that leeching\r\nis, in my opinion, admissible. In the majority of cases instead of\r\ndepletion a poultice slightly irritating, so as to cause redness of\r\nthe skin, should be applied over the kidneys, or for older children,\r\nnot likely to be frightened by the process, the dry cups may be\r\napplied daily. In subacute cases, not attended by any alarming\r\nsymptoms, sufficient redness may be produced by one of the irritating\r\nplasters which the shops contain, constantly worn.\r\n\r\n{556} Eclampsia, described in the preceding pages, is produced, as we\r\nhave seen, during the course of scarlet fever by the irritating effect\r\nof the scarlatinous poison upon the nervous centres, but, occurring\r\nafter the decline of scarlet fever, it is ordinarily produced by the\r\nretained urea. The same remedies are required to control the\r\nconvulsive movements as when they occur under other circumstances. The\r\nbromide of potassium should be immediately administered in large and\r\nfrequent doses whenever eclamptic symptoms arise. During eclampsia a\r\nchild of three years should take five grains of this agent every five\r\nto ten minutes till the attack ceases, and then at longer intervals.\r\nThe hydrate of chloral is a more powerful agent, and if the eclampsia\r\nbe not quickly controlled, I commonly employ it per rectum, dissolved\r\nin one or two teaspoonfuls of water. For a child of three to five\r\nyears five grains should be thrown into the rectum by a small glass or\r\ngutta-percha syringe, and retained by pressure. Properly administered\r\nand retained, it rarely fails to control the eclampsia within ten or\r\nfifteen minutes. Subsequently, occasional doses of the bromide should\r\nbe given to prevent the occurrence of eclampsia while the measures\r\ndescribed above are being employed to relieve the uræmic condition.\r\n\r\nRheumatism, endocarditis, and pericarditis, arising as complications\r\nor sequelæ, require the treatment which is appropriate when they occur\r\nunder other circumstances, but the remedies should not be depressing,\r\nas the system is already enfeebled by the primary disease. The\r\nrheumatism, if mild, usually abates in a few days without medication,\r\nand the affected joints require only some soothing lotion and support\r\nby a bandage. The following liniment may be applied upon muslin and\r\ncovered by cotton wadding:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acid. Carbolici  fl. drachm i;\r\n      Tinc. Belladonna fl. oz. i;\r\n      Ol. Camphorati   fl. oz. ii;\r\n\r\nIf the rheumatism be severe and affect several joints, the sodium\r\nsalicylate should be prescribed, as in the idiopathic disease, with an\r\noccasional opiate to procure rest.\r\n\r\nEndocarditis and pericarditis require rest in the horizontal position,\r\navoidance of all excitement, the use of the tincture or infusion of\r\ndigitalis or of the fluid extract of convalaria to procure a slow and\r\nsteady action of the heart. Three drops of the tincture of digitalis\r\nor five minims of the fluid extract of convalaria may be given every\r\nfour hours to a child of five years. The same external measures should\r\nbe employed as in acute pleuritis. I prefer the application of a thin\r\npoultice of flaxseed containing one-sixteenth part of mustard and\r\ncovered with oiled silk. The cardiac inflammations, as well as\r\nrheumatism, require opiates in sufficient doses to procure rest and\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nPleuritis, which we have stated is apt to be suppurative, demands the\r\nsame treatment as the idiopathic disease when it occurs in cachectic\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{557}\r\n\r\nRUBEOLA.[1]\r\n\r\nBY W.

In normal cases it runs a definite course, which from\r\nthe date of invasion to the end of desquamation occupies about\r\nfourteen days. It is highly contagious, and occurs, as a rule, but\r\nonce in the same person.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--The word rubeola is probably of Spanish origin and was\r\nformerly written rubiola or rubiolo. The designation morbilli is the\r\ndiminutive of the Italian il morbo, the plague. Although it is\r\ndoubtful, as claimed by Willan, that the Greek and Roman physicians\r\nwere acquainted with measles, there is no question that Rhazes was one\r\nof the first to describe the affection correctly. Rubeola is said to\r\nhave been distinguished from variola by the Arabians in the twelfth\r\ncentury; but, nevertheless, as late as the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury we find Sennertus discussing the question \"why the disease in\r\nsome constitutions assumed the form of small-pox, and in others that\r\nof measles;\" and in a posthumous work of Diemerbroeck, published in\r\n1687, it is asserted that small-pox and measles are only different\r\ndegrees of the same affection.[2] According to Mayr, the merit of\r\nhaving shown measles to be a distinct malady from scarlatina must be\r\nascribed to Forestus and Sydenham. It is not clear, however, that the\r\ntwo diseases were accurately differentiated till the close of the last\r\ncentury, and notably by Withering in 1792.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Cyclop. Pract. Med._, London, 1834, p. 625.]\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The exact nature of the measles contagium has never been\r\nsatisfactorily established, although we are in possession of numerous\r\nresearches in that direction, which, however, are to a great extent\r\ncontradictory. A brief examination of these various observations will\r\nnot prove uninteresting. Hallier found in the blood and sputa numbers\r\nof free cocci, which fructified upon various substrata, but was\r\ninvariably the same fungus--mucor mucedo verus, Fres. In 1862,\r\nSalisbury[3] published {558} his observations on the relation of the\r\nstraw fungus to measles. He recorded instances of inoculation with\r\nthis organism that resulted, according to him, in the production of a\r\nmodified form of rubeola, and, moreover, was protective against\r\nfurther attacks of the same disease. In an exhaustive paper bearing on\r\nthis question H. C. Wood[4] quotes certain experimental inoculations\r\nmade by William Pepper, which showed conclusively that measles was not\r\npropagated in this way, and that where any symptoms were developed\r\nthey were not those of true measles, nor did they protect the subjects\r\nfrom unquestioned measles. Salisbury also claimed that measles had\r\noccurred in camps where damp and mouldy straw had been employed for\r\nbedding. J. J. Woodward in his work on _Camp Diseases_ points out that\r\ncamp measles prevailed almost exclusively in regiments from the rural\r\ndistricts, while men enlisted in towns and cities were more or less\r\ncompletely exempt. The explanation was, that those from the country\r\nhad hitherto escaped the disease, while townspeople had suffered from\r\nit at some previous time--a condition of affairs inconsistent with the\r\ntheory of the straw fungus. Coxe and Felz found numerous bacteria in\r\nthe blood of measles patients, especially in regions where the\r\neruption was most pronounced. The nasal mucus also contained similar\r\ngerms. Inoculation of the blood from the subjects of measles upon\r\nrabbits did not produce an analogous affection (Thomas). Klebs[5]\r\nobtained micrococci from the trachea and from blood taken from the\r\nhearts of infant cadavers. \"In the latter, collected in flattened\r\ncapillary tubes, there developed balls of micrococci; in the trachea\r\nboth micrococci and bacteria were present in large quantities. Under\r\nobservation, pale, finely-granular micrococcus balls developed and\r\nchanged very quickly to bacteria, which moved about very actively.\r\nThese sought the periphery, about 1/2 mm. distant from the centre of\r\ndevelopment, and formed a zone, comparable with a hedge or fence that\r\nis composed of rods. From this were formed new masses of micrococci,\r\nbut further no regular process of arrangement or development could be\r\nobserved.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Am. Jour. Med. Sci._, July and Oct., 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ibid._, Oct., 1868, p. 333.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Würzbr. Verh._, N. F., v., 1874, quoted by Forchheimer\r\nin Supplement to _Ziemssen's Cyclopedia_, W. T., 1881, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nBraidwood and Vacher,[6] as the result of a number of experiments,\r\nbelieved that they had sufficient evidence for concluding that the\r\nmost active mode of the transmission of measles was through the\r\nbreath, and accordingly instituted a series of experiments by\r\ncarefully examining the breath of children in the acute stage of the\r\ndisease.[7] With this object in view they coated over with glycerine\r\nthe inside of several clean glass tubes of a diameter of a half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch. As soon as the nature of the eruption was\r\nmanifest the patient was required to breathe through one or more of\r\nthe tubes, and so on each day till the eruption had faded. Upon\r\nexamination of the glycerine with an one-eighth objective every\r\nspecimen showed numerous sparkling bodies, something like those found\r\nin vaccine, but larger. Some were spherical; others were elongated,\r\nwith sharpened ends. They were most abundant during the first and\r\nsecond days of the eruption. Healthy children and patients suffering\r\nfrom typhoid and scarlet fevers were made to imitate these {559}\r\nexperiments, but no such bodies were to be seen in their specimens.\r\nThey conclude from these observations that the small spherical\r\nelements discovered in the breath are perhaps the active agents in the\r\npropagation of measles. Upon post-mortem of patients who had died of\r\nrubeola these germs were found in the lungs and liver, and,\r\nparticularly, close to the walls of the capillaries. They believe that\r\nthe \"lungs are the favorite breeding-ground of the contagium.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Brit. Med. Jour._, Jan. 21, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Several years ago Ransome of Manchester obtained\r\nparticles from the breath of two persons suffering from measles\r\n(Squire).]\r\n\r\nThat inoculation of morbillous blood may convey the disease was first\r\ndemonstrated by Home in 1757, which experiments were verified by\r\nSperanza in 1822 and by Katona in 1842. The inoculations of the latter\r\nare especially noteworthy, as they numbered more than a thousand. No\r\nperson inoculated by him died, and only 7 per cent. of the\r\ninoculations failed. On the other hand, inoculations made by Mayr gave\r\nnegative results. It is stated that Monro and Locke communicated\r\nmeasles by inoculating with the tears and saliva. Attempts of the same\r\nkind were fruitlessly made in Philadelphia in 1801, although the\r\nblood, the tears, the nasal and bronchial mucus, and the exfoliated\r\nlamellæ of the epidermis were successively employed in the trials.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Rayer, _Diseases of the Skin_, Phila., 1845.]\r\n\r\nMayr has shown that the nasal mucus is capable upon inoculation of\r\npropagating the disease. He performed the experiment upon two healthy\r\nchildren living at a distance from each other, at a time when the\r\ndisease had ceased to be epidemic. Some nasal mucus taken from the\r\npatient during the stadium flavitionis, and kept fluid in a glass\r\ntube, was the same day placed upon the mucous membrane of each of\r\nthese children. In one of them the first symptom of sneezing occurred\r\nafter eight days, in the other at the expiration of nine days. Febrile\r\nsymptoms set in two days later. In each child the rash appeared on the\r\nthirteenth day after infection. The inoculated disease was mild and\r\nregular in its course.\r\n\r\nWhile it is perhaps true that the contagion of measles is not so\r\ntenacious as that of small-pox and scarlatina, it is a matter of\r\nobservation that susceptible persons are liable to contract the\r\ndisease, even if not directly exposed to its influence. There is\r\nincontestable evidence that it is conveyed by fomites--a fact well\r\nworth bearing in mind.\r\n\r\nIt is but just to say that so excellent an observer as Mayr taught\r\nthat measles could not be conveyed by clothes, linen, etc. unless\r\ntransferred immediately from one individual to another. Panum,\r\nhowever, showed that contagion could be carried many miles by an\r\nunaffected third person without losing its activity. Aitken[9] has\r\nalso pointed out the fact that children's clothes sent home in boxes\r\nfrom schools where the disease has raged communicated the disease, and\r\nthat susceptible children who had slept in the same beds, in the same\r\nrooms, after they had been occupied by persons suffering from measles,\r\nhave taken the malady. Squire observes that the contagium of measles,\r\nexcept in the catarrhal stage, is not far diffusible in the air, but\r\nclings to surfaces, and may be thus carried from place to place; on\r\nthe other hand, children have been brought, while in full eruption,\r\ninto a house among others, and nursed in a room apart, without any\r\nextension of the disease to the most susceptible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Science and Pract. of Med._, Phila., 1868.]\r\n\r\n{560} Various circumstances render it probable that measles is most\r\nreadily propagated during the stage of efflorescence; but that it is\r\nalso highly infectious during the prodromal period is now universally\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\nAccording to Niemeyer, the probability of infection during the\r\nprodromal stage is supported by the wonderful spread of measles\r\nthrough schools; for, while the strictest surveillance is established\r\nover children with any suspicious eruptions, and those known to have\r\nhad the disease are not allowed to return till long past the stage of\r\ndesquamation, no heed is paid to those exhibiting the premonitory\r\ncough and coryza. There is no reason for believing that measles can be\r\npropagated during the period of incubation; on the other hand, there\r\nis no satisfactory argument for the denial of its infectiousness in\r\nthe desquamative stage. Although Panum is inclined to doubt its\r\ncontagiousness at this time--and his observations are worthy of the\r\ngreatest confidence--other good authorities differ from him\r\nmaterially, and extend the stage of personal infection to a period of\r\nfrom three weeks (Squire) to forty days (Hillairet).\r\n\r\nReasoning from analogy, we would naturally expect that the period of\r\nincubation in measles suffered a certain amount of variation; the\r\nresult of numerous observations confirms this expectation. It is\r\nmanifestly a difficult matter in densely populated communities to\r\nestablish with accuracy the date of a given infection, but from a\r\nstudy of more or less carefully noted cases it will be found that the\r\nperiod of incubation may vary from three to thirty days. For the vast\r\nmajority of cases the average time between the reception of the\r\nmeasles poison and the appearance of the characteristic eruption will\r\nbe about from thirteen to fourteen days. Panum, under exceptionally\r\nfavorable surroundings, found it more frequently fourteen than\r\nthirteen days. Therefore, deducting the three or four days occupied by\r\nthe invasion stage, we shall find that the real incubation period is\r\nfrom nine to ten days from the date of exposure. Mayr's two cases of\r\ninoculation with nasal mucus showed no departure from this rule, but\r\nin the inoculations made by Katona with blood the prodromic symptoms\r\nmade their appearance in seven days, the cutaneous lesions developing\r\ntwo, and at the most three, days afterward.\r\n\r\nMinor epidemics of measles are said to occur every three to five\r\nyears, more extensive and severe ones every seven or eight years. In\r\nthe centres of population measles may be said to be endemic; in\r\nisolated regions the visitations of the disease may be widely\r\nseparated. Measles is a less severe disease in warm than in cold\r\nclimates, and, as a rule, we also find the affection more common and\r\nmore intense in the fall, winter, and spring than in the summer\r\nmonths.[10] Epidemics of measles are usually short, and it is thought\r\nthat there is a definite relation between the severity of their onset\r\nand their duration, this being in general short in proportion as the\r\ngiven epidemic was at first severe (Mayr). Intestinal complications\r\nare more frequent in summer, and involvements of the respiratory\r\norgans more common in winter. The varying aspects of different {561}\r\nepidemics--sthenic, asthenic, etc.--depend on changes in the weather,\r\nseason of the year, the presence of complications, and other agencies\r\nnot very clearly understood. Epidemics of whooping cough may precede,\r\naccompany, or follow in the wake of measles, and it has therefore been\r\nsuggested that it stands in some peculiarly close connection with the\r\nlatter; but, aside from this often-observed coincidence, we are not\r\njustified in our present state of knowledge in assuming any definite\r\nrelation of cause and effect between the two diseases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Aitken (_op. cit._, p. 295) declares that the mortality\r\nreturns from England and Wales show that the influence of season is\r\nmost trifling. Occasionally it has been found that the deaths in\r\nsummer exceeded those in winter, but we believe that the statement\r\nmade above is, in the main, correct. For instance, Parson's figures\r\nfor Berlin for the years 1863-67, inclusive, are: spring, 11.9 per\r\ncent.; summer, 13.3; autumn, 33.4; winter, 41.4. Voit's statistics in\r\nan average of thirty years at the Children's Clinic at Würzburg\r\nestablish the same general principles (Thomas).]\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be neither geographical nor racial bar to the\r\npropagation of measles, for it has been observed in all countries and\r\namong all peoples. As in the case of other zymotic diseases, a\r\ntolerance is established for measles in countries where the disease is\r\nmore or less constantly prevalent; but where the affection becomes\r\nepidemic for the first time, or reappears after many years, it rages\r\nwith terrific violence. This fact was particularly exemplified in the\r\nepidemic in the Faroe Islands, and more especially in the recent\r\n(1877) visitation of the Fiji Islands, where one-fourth of the\r\npopulation succumbed in a comparatively short time.\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable, as asserted by Mayr, that children affected with\r\nscrofulous complaints, as well as those who are the subjects of\r\ndiseases of the respiratory organs--pertussis, bronchitis, or\r\ntuberculosis--are eminently susceptible of measles; but his statement\r\nthat sufferers from epilepsy, chorea, and paralysis exhibit an unusual\r\npower of resistance cannot be accepted without reservation. Acute\r\ndiseases often appear to delay the outbreak of measles, so that the\r\nlatter does not appear till convalescence from the former (Thomas).\r\nThe development of vaccinia is occasionally interfered with by an\r\nattack of rubeola; on the other hand, the two diseases may be seen\r\nrunning their courses together.[11] The emphatic statement made by\r\nHebra, that measles is never seen to occupy a patient simultaneously\r\nwith another acute exanthem, has not been confirmed by other\r\nobservers. My own experience furnishes several examples. Measles may\r\nalso occur during the course of other acute or chronic maladies. From\r\na study of the literature of measles complicating pregnancy and\r\nparturition Underhill[12] finds it to be quite uncommon, due probably\r\nto the fact that most adults are insusceptible of further attacks; but\r\nwhen it does occur in pregnancy he regards it as a very serious and\r\nfrequently fatal complication. Underhill believes measles to be most\r\nfatal when it supervenes soon after delivery, while those who are\r\nconfined during the course of the malady stand a better chance of\r\nrecovering from it. That puerperal women are not always unfavorably\r\naffected by measles is well shown in two remarkable cases reported by\r\nNelson[13] of St. Louis and Chantier[14] of Geneva, in which the\r\nmothers were safely delivered, though suffering from measles\r\ncontracted at the end of their pregnancies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Hardaway, _Essentials of Vaccination_, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Obstet. Jour. Great Britain and Ireland_, July, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _St. Louis Courier of Med._, Sept., 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Annales de Gynécologie_, May, 1879.]\r\n\r\nAll ages are susceptible to the measles poison, and the apparent\r\nexemption enjoyed by adults is due to the fact that most grown-up\r\npeople have already suffered the disease in childhood; but in Panum's\r\nepidemic, mentioned above, it was discovered that nearly all who had\r\nnot had measles {562} elsewhere, or were not old enough to have been\r\nexposed at the last visitation, sixty-five years before, acquired the\r\naffection regardless of age. It is quite probable, however, that the\r\nlaw of decrease of susceptibility with age holds good for measles as\r\nwell as for variola, etc., but to a less degree. It will therefore be\r\nseen that measles is not essentially a disease of childhood. Although\r\nthere is no special limit to the susceptibility of rubeola at one\r\nextreme of life, it would seem to be quite well established that it is\r\nmuch modified at the other--namely, that infants under six months are\r\nrarely attacked. This latter fact is conceded by individual\r\nexperience, by the records of epidemics, and by the testimony of most\r\nobservers.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: On the other hand, as quoted by Forchheimer (_loc.\r\ncit._), H.

Monti has recorded ten cases of rubeola in children\r\nunder two months of age. A case is reported by Kunze where a mother in\r\nthe stage of efflorescence gave birth to a child, which contracted the\r\ndisease five days afterward. Quite a number of cases of congenital\r\nmeasles have been put on record from time to time; but Thomas, after a\r\ncareful investigation, says that he has been able to discover but six\r\nauthentic accounts of such occurrences.[17] That children born to\r\nmothers suffering at the time of parturition from measles may yet\r\nescape it themselves is proven by the cases of Nelson and Gautier\r\nmentioned above. Whether a pregnant woman attacked by measles\r\ntransmits the disease to the foetus in utero, thereby securing\r\nimmunity from it in after life, is a question difficult of decision,\r\nespecially as we have not yet been able to decide this same inquiry,\r\nwith infinitely better opportunities, for vaccinia.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Compendium of Children's Diseases_, N.Y., 1875, p.\r\n396.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: I believe that, under certain circumstances, the\r\nerythema papulatum of the new-born is often mistaken for measles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: See experiments of Burckhardt, Rickett, Gart, and\r\nothers, quoted in Hardaway's _Essentials of Vaccination_, p. 38.]\r\n\r\nThere is no good reason to believe that sex is of much importance in\r\nestablishing a predisposition to measles, although the statement has\r\nbeen repeatedly made that males are more frequently attacked than\r\nfemales. {563} Fox's statistics show a slight preponderance in favor\r\nof the male sex; but a careful examination of accessible statistics\r\nproves, as would be expected, that this degree of susceptibility\r\nvaries at different times in obedience to circumstances not readily\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nBy the older writers (Willan, Rosenstein, Fuchs) it was very\r\ndogmatically asserted that one attack of measles completely\r\nextinguished all future susceptibility to the disease. Of late years\r\nthis dogma has met with much opposition, and numerous observations\r\nhave been recorded which, if entirely trustworthy, would lead us to\r\nbelieve that rubeola may occur not only twice, but several times, in\r\nthe same individual. While from analogy and actual experience we are\r\nquite sure that the recurrence of measles is not so uncommon an event\r\nas it was once held to be, a closer examination of the question in all\r\nits bearings clearly confirms us in the belief that subsequent attacks\r\nare much more infrequent than is now thought to be the case by many,\r\nand that other diseases, more or less resembling true measles, are\r\nlargely responsible for errors of diagnosis in this regard. Panum\r\nfound that all the old people who had measles during the epidemic on\r\nthe Faroe Islands in 1781 escaped it in 1846. Both Rosenstein and\r\nWillan declared that they had never witnessed an instance of the true\r\nrecurrence of measles. Among other facts, it may be stated in this\r\nconnection that Woodward (_loc. cit._) has shown that during our late\r\nwar, while members of regiments recruited from the rural districts,\r\nwho had never before had measles, largely took it when exposed to its\r\ninfluence, regiments from the cities, who had presumably acquired the\r\ndisease in childhood, remained almost entirely exempt.[19] Other\r\narguments of a similar sort could be readily adduced. There is no\r\nquestion that mistakes in diagnosis have occurred from confounding\r\nrötheln, roseola, etc., which closely simulate measles, with that\r\ndisease. Those particularly engaged in the treatment of cutaneous\r\naffections could multiply instances of such errors. It is quite\r\nsignificant that for certain analogous infectious diseases--_e.g._\r\nvariola and scarlatina--the same frequency of recurrence is not\r\nclaimed, although as a matter of fact they do occur. The explanation\r\nwould seem to lie in the fact that neither small-pox nor scarlet fever\r\nis so closely counterfeited by other skin affections, notably by\r\nrötheln, as is measles. But it would be entirely contrary to analogy\r\nand indubitable experience to go to the extreme of the older writers\r\nand absolutely deny the possibility of second, and even third, attacks\r\nof rubeola. The frequency of such cases is, however, as Henoch[20]\r\ntruly states, much overestimated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: These observations of Woodward were made without any\r\nreference to the question at issue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Lectures on Diseases of Children_, N.Y., 1882, p. 282.]\r\n\r\nOccupying quite a different position from the measles induced by\r\nreinfection from without are the so-called relapses of rubeola. These\r\nrelapses, which may occur in from two to four weeks after the original\r\ninvasion, are analogous to the similar occurrences in scarlatina and\r\ntyphoid fever. I am cognizant of but a single case of this sort, but\r\nSteiner and other accurate observers record a number of such\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--It is generally stated that the stage of\r\nincubation exhibits no symptoms whatever; but it is undoubtedly true\r\nthat the patient will sometimes appear dull and listless, and, on\r\noccasion, even give evidence of some slight and ephemeral elevations\r\nof temperature. {564} As a rule, however, this period is devoid of any\r\nmarked indication of the presence of the measles poison in the\r\nsystem.[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Some writers describe a much more marked train of\r\nsymptoms as prevailing at this time than seems warranted by general\r\nexperience, and Rehn has gone so far as to declare that the prodromal\r\nperiod, as usually understood, properly commences in the stage of\r\nincubation. Bohn is inclined to a similar view. The prodromic stage of\r\nauthors is, then, to be looked upon as the \"period of the mucous\r\nmembrane exanthem.\"]\r\n\r\nThe prodromal stage is usually ushered in by symptoms of general\r\nmalaise, fretfulness, more or less frontal headache, shiverings,\r\nnausea, loss of appetite, excited sleep, and sometimes delirium.\r\nVomiting is not so common in measles as in scarlatina, and may occur\r\nat any time previous to the appearance of the rash. The tongue is apt\r\nto be coated, although it may remain clean; the taste is bad, and\r\npressure over the stomach and bowels occasionally elicits considerable\r\npain; an aching pain over the sternum is also noted. As a general\r\nthing, at this time patients are drowsy and inclined to sleep much.\r\nMeigs and Pepper found this a very constant symptom, which they state\r\nis in no way alarming unless associated with other more serious\r\nsymptoms of local or general disturbance. Constipation is present in\r\nsome cases, or the bowels may be relaxed or remain in their natural\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe prodromal fever of measles follows a peculiar course. It is\r\nremarkably remittent in character, and is rarely of such intensity as\r\nto threaten life, as is often the case in scarlet fever. The\r\ntemperature will rise on the first day to 102°-104° F., and the height\r\nof the fever at this time will measurably foreshadow the character of\r\nthe subsequent course. On the second day of the prodromal stage the\r\nfever suffers a marked remission, or may even entirely disappear, to\r\nagain rise in the evening. Smith has observed two exacerbations in the\r\nday. Again, in some instances, after the high initiatory fever, the\r\ntemperature may remain normal till just before the rash comes out\r\n(Bohn). It is this peculiar behavior of the fever, together with the\r\nfact that the child may regain its usual vivacity in the fever-free\r\nintervals, which so often misleads the physician into the diagnosis of\r\nmalarial poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe most pronounced feature of this stage of the disease is, beyond\r\nall others, the catarrhal affection of the mucous membranes. The\r\nmucous membranes of the eyes, nose, mouth, and air-passages are all\r\nmore or less involved, and the patient suffers in varying degrees from\r\nphotophobia, coryza, hoarseness, cough, and pain in swallowing.\r\nSneezing is frequent and annoying, and slight epistaxis is not\r\nuncommon. The cough usually appears on the first day, simultaneously\r\nwith the fever. It is not very troublesome at first, but by the fourth\r\nday it becomes more frequent, assuming a hoarse, barking, paroxysmal\r\ncharacter. Expectoration is scanty, and auscultation reveals a harsh\r\nvesicular murmur or else sibilant râles. Alarming but not dangerous\r\nattacks of false croup may come on during the night. Many observers\r\nhave called attention to the red spots (papules) in the oral cavity,\r\nwhich make their appearance during the period of invasion. According\r\nto Bohn, usually on the second or third day from the beginning of the\r\nfever there appear upon the slightly hyperæmic mucous membrane of the\r\nsoft palate, palatal arch, and uvula small or large, dark, red spots\r\nthat spread to the mucous membrane of the cheeks, and sometimes to the\r\nhard palate, lips, and gums. Soon they become more defined, and are to\r\nbe distinguished by shape and coloring {565} from the membrane upon\r\nwhich they are situated. According to the same authority, they also\r\nafford an index to the intensity and extent of the coming cutaneous\r\neruption. It is also stated that if the latter partakes of a\r\nhemorrhagic character, the spots on the mucous membrane may also\r\nbecome livid. This same punctate reddening has been demonstrated in\r\nthe epiglottis, larynx, and trachea (Gerhardt), and upon the bronchi\r\nand small intestines of children who had died during this stage of the\r\neruption. It is also to be noted on the conjunctivæ. It has been\r\nassumed that this period of this disease is not to be looked upon as\r\nthe stadium prodromorum, but as the period of the \"exanthem of the\r\nmucous membrane.\" This view of the pathology of measles seems to me\r\nmost reasonable; but in whatever way we may look upon the question,\r\nthe practical importance of this precutaneous eruptive stage is to be\r\ninsisted upon for diagnostic purposes, just as is the analogous\r\neruption upon the mucous membrane in small-pox.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases of measles we do not find such profound reaction of\r\nthe nervous system as in scarlatina. I believe that convulsions in the\r\nprodromal stage are much more common than available statistics would\r\nhave us believe; at least, this is my own experience. Meigs and Pepper\r\nmet with convulsions but five times in 314 cases at the beginning of\r\nthe eruption, while Rilliet and Barthez observed but one convulsion in\r\n167 cases. Thomas says that convulsions are almost always absent. On\r\nthe other hand, Trousseau and Bohn expressly declare that they are\r\nvery common, the former stating that they occur with greater frequency\r\nthan in scarlatina. I consider that convulsive seizures occurring in\r\nconnection with marked catarrhal affection of the mucous membranes are\r\nvery important aids in forecasting a probable attack of rubeola.\r\nFortunately, convulsions at this stage are not very serious unless\r\nrepeated or injudiciously treated.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the period of invasion in regular cases is from three\r\nto five days, with an average of about four, but in perfectly\r\nuncomplicated attacks this period may be extended to six or eight\r\ndays, or even longer. But that the duration of this stage may be much\r\nshorter than the average is not sufficiently insisted upon by writers.\r\nRinger,[22] for instance, says that he had an opportunity of testing\r\nthe earliest appearance of the rash in an epidemic of measles in a\r\nlarge public school for boys under twelve. In every case during the\r\nepidemic the rash appeared on the first day, the cases being severe,\r\nthough of short duration, the temperature rising to 103° and to 104°\r\nF. In some instances the rash preceded (?) the fever. Thus, several of\r\nthe boys feeling poorly, their temperature was carefully taken night\r\nand morning under the tongue, and in several cases the rash appeared\r\nin the morning about the face and collar-bone, while the temperature\r\nremained normal, and did not rise till the evening, when it ran up to\r\n101°-103° F., and even higher. These cases certainly resemble rötheln\r\nmore than measles. In two cases, which I observed under very favorable\r\nconditions, the eruption commenced to appear on the morning of the\r\nsecond day, and more or less similar experiences are recorded by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Handbook of Therapeutics_, 6th ed., London, 1868--note\r\nto p. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe skin eruption, which appears, as a rule, on the third, fourth, or\r\nfifth day of the attack, is ushered in with an increase in the general\r\nand {566} local symptoms of the disease. It is particularly to be\r\nremarked that the fever does not subside at this time, as is the case\r\nin variola. The eruption appears first upon the face, about the cheeks\r\nand forehead, then on the chin and neck, and thence gradually\r\noverspreads the trunk, and finally reaches the extremities. When the\r\neruption is intense no part of the body is free from it, the rash\r\nbeing found upon the palms and soles and upon the hairy scalp. The\r\ncutaneous lesions proper consist at first of hyperæmic spots of about\r\na line in diameter, which gradually increase in size, until at their\r\nfull development they may attain a diameter of from one-twentieth to a\r\nquarter of an inch. In the beginning they bear a very close\r\nresemblance to the sub-papular lesions of small-pox. The\r\nmaculo-papules, when fully developed, are slightly elevated above the\r\nlevel of the skin, the elevation, however, being more appreciable to\r\ntouch than sight, have a smooth velvety feel, and are so arranged as\r\nto enclose areas of healthy skin. In the individual spots we may\r\nfrequently observe one or several minute, darker-colored papules, due\r\nto follicular congestion, which when more intense constitutes the\r\nmorbilli papulari presently to be described. The maculæ are, as a\r\nrule, roundish, or they may be moon-shaped, or their borders may\r\npresent an indented or notched appearance. Where the capillary\r\ncirculation is active--on the cheeks, for example--or upon parts\r\nsubjected to pressure, the eruption may become confluent; that is to\r\nsay, the usually pale intervening skin becomes injected or the papules\r\ncoalesce, and in this way produce a uniform redness over large single\r\ntracts of skin. This scarlatinoid rash, however, never occupies the\r\nwhole surface of the body, but only limited regions, and in other\r\nsituations may be detected the characteristic discrete papules of\r\nrubeola; the color is not uniform, but is broken here and there by the\r\ndarker streaks and spots of the measly eruption. The rash, which\r\ndisappears upon pressure to return when the pressure is removed, is of\r\na more or less rosy red, with a tendency in some to deep red, and has\r\noccasionally a purplish hue. According to Mayr and Hebra, it is of the\r\nprecise color which is obtained by adding a little yellow or brown to\r\na red pigment.\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches of Thomas, Squire, and Wunderlich, as\r\nabstracted by Seguin, the fever of the eruptive period is divided into\r\na moderately febrile stage and the fastigium or acme. The moderately\r\nfebrile stage averages thirty-six to thirty-eight hours, and is made\r\nup of one or two exacerbations of 100.4° to 102.2° F., but not quite\r\nso high as the initial fever. If there are two exacerbations, the\r\nsecond one is the higher; the intervening remissions are not so low as\r\nthose of the prodromal stage, yet even now the norm may be noted on a\r\nsingle occasion. The fastigium commences early in the day or in the\r\nevening; if the rise should occur in the morning, the evening\r\ntemperature rises still higher, with or without a slight remission the\r\nfollowing morning, and the next evening attains the maximum. If the\r\nacme begins in the evening, the remission on the next morning is\r\neither absent or very slight. The greatest height of the fever in\r\nnormal cases corresponds to the greatest intensity and development of\r\nthe eruption. This rule is not invariable, however, for sometimes the\r\nfever is higher soon after the eruption appears, and has fallen when\r\nthe exanthem has reached its highest point. The whole fastigium lasts\r\nfrom one and a half to two {567} and a half days, so that the complete\r\neruptive fever occupies from three to four and one-half days.[23] The\r\npulse in general preserves a proportionate correspondence to the\r\ntemperature, and never attains the great frequency to be observed in\r\nscarlatina.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: According to Ringer, the highest temperature reached in\r\nnormal cases is 103° F. Thomas places it as high as 104° F., but\r\nstates that it may go up to 105° F. without the intervention of any\r\ncomplication.]\r\n\r\nThe general symptoms, with the exception of the fever, do not greatly\r\ndiffer from those common to the prodromal stage. The skin is hot and\r\nmore or less swollen, particularly about the face; there are anorexia,\r\nphotophobia, lachrymation, and sometimes epistaxis; the cough\r\ncontinues, and is generally frequent and harassing, and attended with\r\nlittle or no expectoration; the voice is hoarse. The tongue is coated,\r\nprincipally in the middle, through which the swollen papillæ protrude,\r\nwhile the tip and sides are red. The blotchy redness of the oral\r\ncavity is visible for some days, and finally becomes indistinguishable\r\nfrom the surrounding congestion. The tonsils sometimes become\r\nconsiderably enlarged, though suppuration must be rare. Enlargement of\r\nthe glands behind the jaw and in the neck and groin are to be\r\nobserved. At the outset of the eruption a profuse diarrhoea supervenes\r\nin most cases--a symptom which Trousseau rightly insists to be an\r\nessential feature of measles. This occurrence is interpreted by some\r\nwriters as an evidence of the implication of the mucous membranes in\r\nthe specific exanthem of the disease. This flux, which is sometimes\r\naccompanied by a little blood and tenesmus, rarely continues long, and\r\nmay be succeeded by a degree of constipation. The respiration is\r\ngenerally somewhat accelerated, mostly in correspondence to the amount\r\nof fever present. Some degree of deafness is not uncommon, owing to\r\nthe extension of inflammation along the Eustachian tubes. The urine is\r\nscanty and high colored; there is sometimes scalding in urination and\r\nvesical tenesmus, and at the acme of the fever traces of albumen may\r\nbe detected.\r\n\r\nThe eruption, in fact, generally occupies the skin an average of four\r\ndays, and, although this period may be shortened materially, it is\r\nless apt to be lengthened. The duration of the eruption at its maximum\r\nof development over the whole surface is about half a day, more or\r\nless, and, as a rule, corresponds with the greatest elevation of the\r\ntemperature. The retrocession of the rash takes place in the order of\r\nits appearance--viz. first from the face, then from the trunk and\r\nupper parts of the extremities, and last from about the feet and\r\nhands, where, indeed, it may remain vivid, or even progress for a\r\nshort time longer, after the eruption has begun to subside in other\r\nsituations. Sometimes the almost faded spots will be temporarily\r\nrenewed by an abnormal rise in the temperature.\r\n\r\nWith the decline of the eruption the other symptoms begin to subside.\r\nThe cough loses its hacking, paroxysmal character, and becomes less\r\nand less frequent, and gradually disappears. The voice regains its\r\nnormal tone, the tongue loses its fur, cleaning up in patches, and\r\nexpectoration, which was absent or scanty and viscid in the beginning,\r\nincreases and is free, the masses coughed up being coin-shaped and\r\nfloating in a clear watery mucus--a symptom much dwelt upon by the\r\nolder writers. The behavior of the temperature at this period--the\r\nstage of decline--is quite {568} characteristic. The fall usually\r\nbegins at night, and generally the next morning it has reached the\r\nnorm or else fallen below it. On the other hand, the descent may be\r\nless precipitate, and the fall continues less rapidly all through the\r\nday; or there may be a slight rise again in the evening, the norm\r\nbeing reached the following morning. The termination by lysis--that\r\nis, slight elevations in the evening for several days--is much rarer,\r\nand while it may occur in perfectly regular cases, it should put the\r\nmedical attendant on his guard against complications.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively normal course of measles portrayed in the preceding\r\nparagraphs does not always occur, but, on the contrary, the disease\r\nmay depart from the more usual type in one or more particulars, either\r\nin especial stages of its progress or in the greater or less intensity\r\nof the malady as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those cases of measles where the eruptive and catarrhal\r\nsymptoms are so slight as to almost escape observation, except for the\r\nexistence of other cases in the same house or family, there are to be\r\nrecognized two other trivial varieties of the disease--namely, measles\r\nwithout the catarrh, and measles without the rash.\r\n\r\nThat the eruption of measles should occur upon the skin without\r\nimplication of the mucous membranes seems to be much more doubtful\r\nthan that the catarrh should appear without the eruption. It is quite\r\nprobable, at any rate, that many so-called cases of rubeola sine\r\ncatarrho are merely instances of rötheln, which we know may occur\r\nwithout any reference to an existing epidemic of measles. But that\r\nthis form of measles does exist is admitted by trustworthy observers,\r\nalthough its diagnosis under any circumstances must be a matter of\r\ngreat difficulty. Measles without the eruption (rubeola sine\r\neruptione) is more readily recognized, especially and only, however,\r\nwhen a susceptible person is exposed, and as a result acquires the\r\ncharacteristic catarrhal symptoms. Since in recent years more\r\nattention has been paid to the eruption on the mucous membranes, it\r\nmay be that its discovery in these situations may lend positive\r\nassistance to the diagnosis in such cases. It is hard to understand\r\nhow this variety of measles, which presents no inflammatory changes in\r\nthe skin, should be followed by desquamation; yet this observation has\r\nbeen made. The assertion that these anomalous forms of the affection\r\nafford no protection against subsequent attacks seems to be founded in\r\nerror, and is undoubtedly due to the confusion existing between\r\nmeasles and rötheln or other exanthems.\r\n\r\nContinental writers, especially, describe a form of measles called by\r\nthem inflammatory or synochal. It is simply an exaggeration of the\r\nsymptoms, particularly those appertaining to the mucous membranes,\r\nfound in ordinary measles (morbilli vulgaris). The prodromal stage is\r\nmuch more violent, the nervous symptoms more threatening, the\r\nimplication of the mucous membranes more pronounced and persistent,\r\nthe febrile movement is of a higher inflammatory character, and the\r\neruption, which instantly covers the whole body (Vogel), is made up of\r\ndark-red or purplish spots which fade slowly. It is this form of\r\nmeasles, according to Niemeyer, which is chiefly attended by croupous\r\ninstead of catarrhal laryngitis, in which the inflammation of the\r\nair-passages often extends to the alveoli of the lungs, and in which\r\nthe gastric and intestinal coats are often affected with catarrh.\r\n\r\n{569} Let the contagion of measles be a grade more virulent, or\r\nperhaps the resisting power of the patient more feeble, and the case\r\nwill assume the features of the septic, typhous, or hemorrhagic\r\nvariety (rubeola nigra). It is said that the hemorrhagic measles is\r\nmost apt to occur in epidemics; certain it is that the dreaded black\r\nmeasles of former times is very infrequent now-a-days, due, no doubt,\r\nto a more rational treatment and a better hygiene. Isolated cases,\r\nhowever, are occasionally encountered. As a rule, from the beginning\r\nall the symptoms evidence an overwhelming of the system by the\r\nvirulence of the poison--a condition of things much more common in\r\nscarlatina. The pulse becomes weak, thready, and frequent; the\r\ntemperature lacks the typical remittent character of normal measles;\r\nthere is unusual prostration; and the nervous centres are profoundly\r\nconcerned, as shown by delirium, convulsions, and coma. The eruption\r\nlags, and finally makes its appearance in an imperfect or irregular\r\nmanner. The spots are of a livid hue, interspersed with larger or\r\nsmaller ecchymoses. Hemorrhages from the mucous cavities take place,\r\nand the patient dies in convulsions or sinks into fatal coma. It has\r\nbeen said that the grave constitutional symptoms do not generally make\r\ntheir appearance till the eruptive stage, but I know from experience\r\nthat the patient may be overwhelmed quite early, as in purpura\r\nvariolosa.\r\n\r\nToo much stress should not be laid on these different types of the\r\ndisease, whether mild or grave, since they depend upon a common cause,\r\nhowever much modified in one way or another; but they may be allowed\r\nto stand for the sake of clinical convenience.\r\n\r\nMeasles may also present certain irregularities in its various stages\r\nwithout necessarily departing from the otherwise benign character of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nAs stated elsewhere, it is believed by some writers that a greater\r\npart of the period of incubation is occupied by symptoms which already\r\nindicate the activity of the measles poison in the system, and that,\r\ntherefore, this stadium in reality lasts but a few days. This opinion\r\ndoes not seem to be generally accepted; at any rate, I think we are\r\nquite safe in saying that in the majority of cases no departure from\r\nthe usual latency is observed. The deviations in the stage of invasion\r\nhave been considered above, and mostly concern its duration and the\r\ncharacter of the temperature. Evanescent rashes, which have nothing in\r\ncommon with the specific exanthem, are sometimes observed at this\r\nperiod. The eruption of measles may present certain peculiarities.\r\nFirst, as to localization. Instead of coming out on the face first, it\r\nmay primarily develop on other parts of the body, provoked into\r\nexistence, as it were, by local exciting causes; thus, where ointments\r\nor plasters have been applied or upon a part subjected to constant\r\npressure. It may affect only one-half of the body, or entirely spare\r\nparalyzed extremities (Mayr). In some instances the papules are so\r\nsparse, indistinct, and short-lived as to be scarcely appreciable.\r\n\r\nSecond, as to the physical characters of the eruption. Hebra and Mayr\r\nrecognize the following modifications:\r\n\r\nMorbilli lævis. The efflorescence is smooth and flat, and the\r\nindividual lesions are separated from each other by normal integument.\r\nThis is the common form of measles.\r\n\r\n{570} Morbilli papulosi. The papules are dark red and more elevated,\r\nare about the size of hempseeds, and situated at the mouths of the\r\nhair-follicles.\r\n\r\nMorbilli vesiculosi. In this variety the mouths of the hair-follicles\r\nare filled with fluid and produce delicate transparent vesicles.\r\n\r\nMorbilli confluentes. The maculæ are here so crowded together that no\r\nhealthy skin intervenes.\r\n\r\nMorbilli hæmorrhagici. The efflorescence consists of maculæ or papulæ\r\nof a dark-red color, due to extravasations of blood, and do not fade\r\non pressure. It is well to mention in this connection the fact,\r\nparticularly noted by Meigs and Pepper in this country, that\r\nhemorrhages into the skin may occur in cases which otherwise run a\r\nbenign course. They are best seen after the eruption has faded. In\r\nsome cases the efflorescence of measles may remain visible for a week\r\nor ten days.\r\n\r\nAs heretofore observed, there may be a relapse of the measles eruption\r\nafter some weeks, accompanied by fever. It is said that the spots\r\nappear on parts of the skin hitherto normal (Thomas). So far as I\r\nknow, Hebra was one of the first to point out the fact that the\r\nso-called striking-in of the eruption was the result, and not the\r\ncause, of some complication in the disease; for, as this author\r\nstates, before the rash fades or disappears the internal disease is\r\nalways present. It is well known, for instance, that syphilitic\r\neruptions will sometimes disappear upon the supervention of some acute\r\nintercurrent affection, such as pneumonia, acute rheumatism, etc.; but\r\nno one will suppose for a moment that the retrocession of the\r\nsyphilides was the cause of these affections.[24] The pathological\r\nexplanation seems obvious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: See Bumstead and Taylor on _Venereal Diseases_, 4th\r\nedit., p. 513.]\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS.--The complications of measles consist, as a rule, in\r\nthe exaggerated morbid action of organs or parts that are essentially\r\nimplicated in the disease; therefore we are most apt to encounter such\r\naffections as laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc. Inflammation of\r\nserous membranes, on the other hand, are rare; thus, pleurisy is\r\ninfrequent unless in connection with a lobar pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe exact causes of the complications are not always obvious, but in\r\nmany instances can be traced to the previous bad health of the\r\npatient, to the influence of insanitation, or, finally, to certain\r\nill-understood features attendant upon some epidemics.\r\n\r\nSimple bleeding from the nose, not associated with the hemorrhagic\r\ndiathesis, is not an uncommon accompaniment of the prodromal stage,\r\nand is rarely a dangerous symptom--rather the contrary. It may also\r\narise after the development of the rash, and occasionally proves a\r\ncomplication of serious import.\r\n\r\nThe aural complications, unlike those in scarlatina, are generally not\r\nsufficiently prominent at first to attract attention. The symptoms,\r\nparticularly pain and deafness, are apt to be masked. Purulent\r\nprocesses and consequent perforation may occur during the eruption,\r\nbut are more frequent at the stage of desquamation (Spencer).[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Oral communication.]\r\n\r\nVarious disorders of the skin have been observed during the course of\r\nmeasles--viz. miliary vesicles, and even pustules, as already\r\ndescribed; herpes facialis, zoster femoralis (Thomas), and\r\nerythematous rashes, which {571} may precede, accompany, or, it is\r\nsaid, follow the eruption. Of considerably more importance is the\r\npemphigoid eruption mentioned by several observers. In Henoch's[26]\r\ncase, a girl of four years, the usual remission of the fever on the\r\nevening of the second day was absent, and from the third day there\r\nappeared over nearly the whole surface blebs filled with a limpid\r\nfluid, which varied in size from a hazel-nut to a thaler, and even\r\nlarger. The cheeks and the backs of the hands were each covered with a\r\nsingle bleb. The exanthem was of a hemorrhagic character, and the\r\nintervening skin was red and the face swollen. The bullæ appeared not\r\nonly where the eruption existed, but also on parts of the body free\r\nfrom it. The fever remained at the same height till the fifth day,\r\nwhen, upon the cessation of the bullous eruption, it fell to 100° F.\r\nA.M., and 101° F. P.M. The child died on the eighth day of a pneumonia\r\nwhich developed between the sixth and seventh days. Other cases have\r\nbeen reported by Steiner, Klüppel, and Löschner. Henoch rejects the\r\ntheory that the bullæ are the result of the morbillous dermatitis, but\r\nthinks that they are merely instances of the coincidence of a\r\ncontagious pemphigus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Berl. klin. Woch._, No. 13, 1882.]\r\n\r\nThe severe affections of the eye described by continental\r\nwriters--blennorrhoea, keratitis, iritis, etc.--are certainly very\r\nrare in this country as complications of measles. Various so-called\r\nstrumous disorders of this organ, as will be seen hereafter, not\r\nuncommonly, however, come under the care of the ophthalmologist as\r\nsequelæ of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe tonsils and the mucous membrane of the pharynx may become severely\r\ninflamed. The tonsils are sometimes very much enlarged, but\r\nsuppuration, if it occur, is certainly rare. Slight ulceration of the\r\ngums close to the teeth is occasionally noted, also aphthous\r\nulcerations on the lips, tongue, and gums (Ringer).\r\n\r\nSome degree of laryngitis is an accompaniment of all cases of measles.\r\nIt has already been stated that catarrhal or false croup is frequently\r\nobserved during the stage of invasion. Inflammation of the larynx may\r\nbe present in all grades of severity. Rilliet and Barthez found\r\nulcerations and erosions, especially of the vocal cords, upon\r\npost-mortem examination of a large proportion of measles subjects; and\r\nGerhardt, both during life and by autopsy, has verified these\r\nobservations. Loeri[27] states that inflammatory changes are more\r\nmarked in the larynx and trachea than in the pharynx. According to his\r\nexaminations, hemorrhages or ecchymoses seldom occur, but more\r\nfrequently superficial or even deep catarrhal ulcers, especially on\r\nthe anterior aspect of the posterior wall of the larynx at the apices\r\nof the cartilages of Santorini, or on the posterior portion of the\r\nvocal cords. The physical condition of these parts readily accounts\r\nfor the frequent and harassing cough and attacks of spasmodic\r\nlaryngitis which are such frequent complications of the invasion and\r\neruptive stages of measles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Jahrb. f. Kinderheilk._, xix. B., 1 H.]\r\n\r\nThere may be an extension of the tracheo-bronchitis to the finer\r\nbronchial tubes, thus producing capillary bronchitis (suffocative\r\ncatarrh). It is apt to prove fatal to very young children. It occurs\r\nmore generally during or after the eruption.\r\n\r\nPneumonia is one of the most frequent and, directly and indirectly,\r\nmost dangerous complications of measles. Catarrhal pneumonia\r\n(broncho-pneumonia) is, for obvious reasons, more common than the\r\nlobar or {572} croupous variety. Pneumonia may develop at almost any\r\nstage of measles, but experience does not confirm the statement\r\noccasionally made that it is most frequent in the initial stage. Most\r\nobservers will agree as to its greater frequency just at the end of\r\nthe eruption or during the desquamative period. The occurrence of\r\nepileptoid convulsions, or an untoward increase of the fever, or an\r\nunexplained continuance of the same, should direct the attention of\r\nthe attendant to the chest, if his anxiety have not already been\r\naroused by a change in the character of the respiration or other\r\nsymptoms. It may be mistaken for meningitis (Squire). In estimating\r\nthe prognosis it should be remembered that croupous and catarrhal\r\npneumonias run quite different courses. The influence of inflammation\r\nof the lungs upon the rash is quite decided. If an intense pneumonia\r\nshould develop in the initial stage, the eruption will be pale and\r\nsparse, or else absent; if the eruption is already out at the time of\r\nthe attack, it may become temporarily more vivid, to rapidly fade\r\nlater.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: A scanty rash by no means indicates an unfavorable\r\ncourse of the disease; this symptom is only serious when evidently due\r\nto some complication.]\r\n\r\nChadbourne[29] has the merit of calling attention to the occurrence of\r\nheart-clot and subsequent pulmonary oedema as a fatal complication of\r\nmeasles. In a number of autopsies he found that in each case the heart\r\ncontained clear gelatinous clots of a very firm consistence, which in\r\nmost instances extended to the pulmonary arteries, and in some to the\r\nextent of one and one-fourth inches. In the series of cases observed\r\nby him pneumonic consolidation was mostly absent, and there was very\r\nlittle evidence of collapse, but the lungs were exceedingly\r\noedematous. But Keating has also found heart-clot to be the cause of\r\ndeath in some cases, and believes, as the result of his\r\ninvestigations, that the presence of large numbers of micrococci in\r\nthe blood and in the white blood-corpuscles is responsible for this\r\ncondition.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Am. Jour. Obstet._, Oct., 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Phila. Med. Times_, Aug. 12, 1882.]\r\n\r\nThere is a strong tendency in measles to intestinal catarrh. As\r\nalready stated, a quite sharp diarrhoea is not uncommon at the\r\nbeginning of the eruptive stage; but, unless it should prove very\r\nprofuse and long-continued, it is not to be looked upon as of very\r\nserious import, especially if the other general symptoms of the\r\ndisease are following a normal course. In other instances the bowel\r\naffection may be much more severe, giving rise to tenesmus, bloody\r\nstools, and the other phenomena of colitis. In weakly children the\r\nearly diarrhoea may persist in spite of treatment for many days;\r\nindeed, under the influence of high temperatures it may take on a true\r\ncholeraic character. Diarrhoea is a very frequent and grave\r\ncomplication of the broncho-pneumonia of measles.\r\n\r\nAcute miliary tuberculosis as an immediate concomitant of measles is\r\nrare. According to Thomas, the disease at times immediately follows\r\nthe exanthem, and reaches a fatal issue in a few days or weeks. The\r\ntubercles are more particularly to be found in the lungs and in the\r\nmembranes of the brain.\r\n\r\nAmong the more common disturbances of the nervous system convulsions\r\nplay an important rôle. The epileptoid seizures of the prodromal stage\r\ngenerally terminate favorably, but in some cases of a malignant\r\ncharacter the onset of the disease may be ushered in with fatal {573}\r\nconvulsions. Convulsions in the later stages are apt to have a lethal\r\ntermination, as they usually occur in connection with some grave\r\ncomplication, particularly of the thoracic organs.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria is an exceedingly grave complication of measles, although\r\nnot necessarily a fatal one. It is of less frequent occurrence than in\r\nscarlatina. It may attack any of the usual oral, nasal, or laryngeal\r\nregions, sometimes extending into the bronchi, but suffers no\r\nmodifications in its symptoms and course from the primary disease. It\r\nmay also rarely involve other parts--_e.g._ genitals, eyelids, etc.\r\nThere is reason to believe that it is most prone to attack those cases\r\nin which the mucous membranes have undergone the greatest inflammatory\r\nalterations.[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Loeri (_loc. cit._) says that diphtheria may appear at\r\nany stage of measles, and commences generally in the larynx, and\r\nsometimes in the trachea simultaneously; seldom in the pharynx, as in\r\nprimary diphtheria or in that complicating other diseases than\r\nmeasles.]\r\n\r\nMany other complications of measles have been recorded in literature\r\n(see Thomas, _op. cit._); but it is no doubt true, as observed by\r\nBohn, that very few of them have a real essential connection with that\r\naffection, and might as readily be associated with any other malady,\r\nespecially in already vitiated constitutions. In the above sketch the\r\nendeavor has been made to indicate those disorders which from the\r\nnature of measles would seem to have a more or less close and definite\r\nrelationship to it. It is certain that the more serious complications\r\nand sequelæ of measles are comparatively infrequent in private\r\npractice in America, although common enough in continental Europe, and\r\nto a certain extent in the children's asylums and foundling hospitals\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\nSEQUELÆ.--It is a difficult matter to dissociate the complications and\r\nsequelæ of measles. Properly speaking, the sequelæ are to be looked\r\nupon as the complications which have continued in existence after the\r\nsubsidence of the exanthem; but it is also customary to include under\r\nthis head certain affections that are the result of the derangement of\r\nthe system by the morbillous process.\r\n\r\nAs would be expected, among the most frequent sequelæ of measles are\r\nthose diseases which have their seat in the mucous membranes. Thus, we\r\nmay observe various grades of inflammation and ulceration of the\r\nlarynx, trachea, and bronchial tubes. According to Loeri, follicular\r\nulcers of the larynx always give a bad prognosis, for these cases\r\nusually succumb to tuberculosis. It is not uncommon to observe a\r\nbronchial catarrh, apparently simple in nature, which persists with\r\nfrequent exacerbations for many months. The very frequent\r\nbroncho-pneumonia, which occurs as a complication, always remains as a\r\nsequel, or it may develop after the morbillous process has come to an\r\nend. In favorable cases recovery may take place in two or three weeks,\r\nor, preceded by hectic and progressive emaciation, the disease may\r\nprove fatal after a number of months. But even here it is not\r\nimpossible for affected persons to recover.\r\n\r\nChronic pulmonary tuberculosis is one of the most formidable and\r\nfrequent sequelæ of measles. It is a not uncommon occurrence that,\r\nwith the exception of some trivial bronchitis, a patient may\r\napparently recover his health completely, and only after a lapse of\r\ntime slight daily elevations of temperature, accompanied by loss of\r\nappetite and emaciation, {574} first give warning of the impending\r\ndanger. This form of phthisis may follow either croupous or catarrhal\r\npneumonia. Granular meningitis or general miliary tuberculosis also\r\nfrequently follows in the wake of measles, connected in many cases\r\nwith foci of caseous degeneration in the involved lymphatic glands or\r\nunabsorbed pneumonic exudation.\r\n\r\nVarious gangrenous affections, particularly of the oral cavity (noma)\r\nand genitals, but also of the skin, subcutaneous connective tissue,\r\ncartilages of the nose, ear, etc., are often to be observed after an\r\nattack of measles. Cancrum oris is to be especially noted.\r\n\r\nAlbuminuria is not an essential sequel of measles, although it may\r\noccasionally occur as the result of great exposure and neglect.\r\n\r\nA large group of chronic affections may follow in the track of\r\nmeasles, either in the form of sequelæ to the complications which\r\narise during the course of the disease or in the nature of secondary\r\naccidents. Some few, perhaps, are more common after measles than after\r\nany other complaint, but the majority are such as might arise in\r\nweakly children subsequent to any specific disturbance of the health.\r\nIn addition to those already mentioned we may especially designate\r\nchronic intestinal disease, together with ulcerations and strictures\r\nof the bowel; chronic coryza, in varying degrees of obstinacy and\r\nseverity; chronic ophthalmia, under which title may be included\r\nciliary blepharitis, granulations, trachoma, phlyctenular\r\nconjunctivitis, ulcers of the cornea, etc. (Michel[32]); aural\r\naffections in the form of chronic suppurative inflammation, and, more\r\nrarely, chronic catarrh of the middle ear (Spencer); certain cutaneous\r\ndiseases, more especially in my experience furunculosis and pustular\r\neczema; chronic bone and joint disorders (strumous), which, according\r\nto Gibney,[33] may not only be evoked in the already hereditarily\r\npredisposed, but also induced when the diathesis has not heretofore\r\nexisted; and, lastly, various derangements of the nervous system.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Oral communication.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See valuable statistical article in _N.Y. Med. Record_,\r\nJune 3, 1882.]\r\n\r\nIn Thomas's valuable and freely-quoted monograph on measles (_op.\r\ncit._) it is stated that secondary measles can exert various\r\ninfluences upon the primary disturbance. In most instances when\r\nmeasles attacks a person already the subject of some other disease,\r\nparticularly when the latter belongs to the common complications of\r\nthe former, it usually is aggravated. This is a matter of common\r\nexperience; but this author further declares--and supports his\r\nassertion with numerous references--that, on the other hand, should\r\nmeasles appear during the existence of a disease to which it does not\r\nusually give rise, it may favorably influence the course of the\r\nlatter. In spite of the cases quoted in support of this view, such\r\nresults would appear to be contrary to pathological laws.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Thus, while Thomas seems to be without personal\r\nexperience in the matter, he quotes without dissent a number of\r\nobservations in support of his assertion--viz.: Behrend saw a chronic\r\neczema of the scalp permanently disappear after measles; Rilliet found\r\nthat a chronic coxitis improved noticeably after measles; various\r\nchronic skin symptoms, and also chorea, epilepsy, incontinence of\r\nurine, mania, worms, dropsy, joint diseases, ophthalmia, gonorrhoea,\r\netc., have been known to recover under the same influence. Gibney\r\n(_loc. cit._) in his valuable paper states that he can readily believe\r\nthat, occasionally, any acute disease, occurring in the course of a\r\nchronic one, will prove beneficial to the other, but that he is far\r\nfrom considering this to be anything more than an exception to a very\r\ngeneral rule to the contrary. Chronic joint disease, he continues, is\r\nespecially a disease of exacerbations, and any one not familiar with\r\ntheir natural history may interpret the post hoc as a propter hoc.\r\nGibney has collected 24 cases of chronic bone disease in {575}\r\nchildren, 21 of whom were under ten years of age and all under\r\nthirteen. On analysis he found that 12 of these came out of the\r\nintercurrent disease in a worse condition, 11 were unaffected, and 1\r\nonly seemed a little better. In my personal experience I have\r\ninvariably seen the eczemas of children made worse by measles. I have\r\nno wish to dispute the trustworthiness of the statistics quoted by\r\nThomas; indeed, I regard them as mostly thoroughly reliable instances\r\nof exceptions to a general pathological law; but I wish it to be\r\nclearly understood that they are such, and that measles is not a\r\ndisease to be slightly regarded as to its effects upon the system.]\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The normal rash of measles is not to be observed on\r\nthe dead body, and the only lesions of the skin to be noted are those\r\nresulting from extravasation of blood into that tissue. Examination of\r\nthe skin removed during life from a patient with measles reveals the\r\nfollowing anatomical changes, according to Morris.[35] In the earliest\r\nstages are found usually slight hyperæmia around the orifice of a\r\nsebaceous follicle, with slight swelling from effusion of plasma.\r\nOccasionally swelling alone is present, and more rarely hyperæmia\r\nonly. Round the small hyperæmic papule thus developed--often pierced\r\nby a hair--a roseolar patch, due to congestion of the papillary body,\r\nsoon makes its appearance. Slight exudation of plasma, with a few\r\ncorpuscles, usually follows, and produces elevation of the papule\r\nitself. As most of the deaths in measles are due to the presence of\r\nsome complication, the post-mortem changes will be found to correspond\r\nto the lesions produced by these diseases, principally affections of\r\nthe respiratory organs and intestinal tract.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Skin Diseases_, Phila., 1880, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--As a rule, the diagnosis of measles offers no great\r\ndifficulties, especially if a correct clinical picture of the disease\r\nhas been thoroughly impressed upon the mind. The salient points may be\r\nthus summarized: A period of incubation of about fourteen days--_i.e._\r\nfrom the date of infection to the commencement of the eruption; a\r\nprodromic stage of about four days, ushered in with fever and marked\r\nimplication of the mucous tract, notably cough, coryza, epistaxis, and\r\nphotophobia; in this stage may also be noted the punctated redness of\r\nthe conjunctivæ and of the palatal mucous membrane, which is to be\r\nregarded as a diagnostic sign of great value and importance; finally,\r\nthere appears at the conclusion of the stage of invasion,\r\nsimultaneously with increase of the febrile movement, a characteristic\r\neruption upon the cutaneous surface, this eruption coming out first\r\nupon the face, and composed of large maculo-papules of brownish-red\r\ncolor, arranged in a crescentic form with tracts of normal integument\r\nintervening. Of all the symptoms of measles, the catarrh of the mucous\r\nmembranes is undoubtedly the most pathognomonic. In the colored races,\r\nwhere the recognition of the skin lesion is often a matter of\r\ndifficulty, this combination of symptoms should be borne in mind.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Corre (_La Mère et l'Enfant dans les races humaines_,\r\nParis, 1882) states that measles and scarlatina exist in all climates\r\nand among all races; however, they are less frequent in warm than in\r\ncold climates. This relative rarity may be only apparent, and has only\r\nbeen established by reason of the difficulty of recognizing exanthems\r\namong dark-skinned peoples. In the negro the eruption (of measles)\r\noften escapes observation, but the general symptoms, the angina,\r\ncoryza, and bronchitis, and the special coloration of the\r\nbucco-pharyngeal membranes, permit the establishment of the diagnosis.\r\nThe skin appears more tense, and the face especially is puffed and\r\nglossy; in passing the hand over the different regions of the body\r\nslight elevations are felt--a difference in the level of the skin\r\nexists in the affected and unaffected portions. On examining the\r\nsurface of the body obliquely at a well-pronounced angle of incidence,\r\nthese elevations can be perceived by the eye. Desquamation, which is\r\nvery manifest in the negro, also confirms the diagnosis; this\r\ndesquamation is formed of epidermic débris; it gives rise to a {576}\r\nwhite dust, which is well defined against the black skin. The skin\r\nitself seems to have lost its gloss; it is completely dry, and no\r\nlonger gives the abundant and odoriferous secretion characteristic of\r\nthe subjects of that race.]\r\n\r\nIn the way of conjectural diagnosis, the presence of an epidemic of\r\nmeasles in the community should be taken into account. Although\r\nmeasles possesses features so characteristic and pronounced, there are\r\na number of other diseases with which it may be confounded, especially\r\nin its earlier stages.\r\n\r\nThere is no other disease which presents so close a resemblance to\r\nmeasles as does rötheln, and it must be confessed that under certain\r\ncircumstances the question of diagnosis is a perplexing one. In\r\nrötheln the appearance of the eruption is often the first symptom of\r\nthe affection, whereas in measles there is a prodromic period, having\r\na peculiar remittent type of fever, which continues for three or four\r\ndays. According to Liveing, the short duration of the febrile attack\r\nbefore the eruption appears is one of the most constant and\r\ndistinctive features wherein rötheln differs from ordinary measles. In\r\nsome instances, in rötheln the premonitory fever is not at all\r\nappreciable. The catarrhal involvement of the mucous membranes is not\r\nnearly so marked as in measles, while the very frequent sore throat\r\nbears more resemblance to the angina of scarlet fever. In many\r\ninstances, although by no means constantly, the eruption of rötheln\r\nfirst appears on the chest, and not on the face, as is the rule in\r\nmeasles. It is quite evident that the eruptive spots of rötheln have\r\npresented different physical features in different epidemics; but, as\r\na general thing, it may be said that they are smaller than those in\r\nmeasles, of a paler color, and, according to Thomas, not so angular,\r\nless indented, and not so often provided with processes, therefore\r\nless apt to assume the crescentic arrangement so often seen in\r\nmeasles.[37] The incubation period is longer in rötheln than in\r\nmeasles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: According to Curtman (_St. Louis Courier Med._, June,\r\n1882), the eruption of rötheln consists, when not confluent, of single\r\npapules, each separated by a distinct small red areola. Not\r\ninfrequently the papules are large, and sometimes a few pass into\r\nvesicles or pustules. In measles the papules are very small, mostly\r\nconfluent, from four to six landing on a single areola, which is\r\nlarger than that of rötheln.]\r\n\r\nIn scarlet fever the incubation stage is shorter than in measles, and\r\nthe constitutional symptoms are apt to be more pronounced; the\r\ntemperature is higher, the pulse more rapid, and vomiting more\r\nfrequent. The stage of invasion in scarlatina is but twenty-four\r\nhours; in measles, seventy-two. There is absence of the characteristic\r\ncatarrh of measles, and the presence of severe sore throat, strawberry\r\ntongue, and swelling of the lymphatics at the angle of the jaws. In\r\nmeasles the rash begins on the face; in scarlatina, on the neck and\r\nchest. In measles the eruption consists of large papules arranged\r\nsomewhat crescentically, with intervening normal skin, followed by\r\nbran-like desquamation; in scarlatina the rash is made up of large\r\npatches formed of minute red spots on a bright red, hyperæmic base,\r\nand is followed by desquamation in large lamellæ. In measles the rash\r\nis brightest on exposed parts; in scarlatina, most vivid on covered\r\nregions. The sequelæ of the two diseases are quite different.\r\n\r\nThere is no great difference in the duration of the invasion stages of\r\nvariola and rubeola; but in the former disease we have the marked\r\nlumbar and sacral pains and vomiting, while in the latter the\r\ncatarrhal symptoms and photophobia are pathognomonic. When the\r\neruption of {577} small-pox appears there is subsidence of fever; in\r\nmeasles, an exacerbation. A point of great importance in the diagnosis\r\nof variola is found in an examination of the mouth and pharynx, for in\r\nthese situations on the fourth day we will often find the vesicles\r\nfully developed, while on the skin they are still in the stage of\r\npapulation. When measles assumes the papular form (morbilli papulosi,\r\nrougeole bouttoneuse), it is often confounded with the papular stage\r\nof small-pox. I have seen a number of such mistakes made. Attention to\r\nthe general symptoms of the two diseases, however, and particularly an\r\nexamination of the mucous membranes, will generally clear up any\r\ndoubt. At any rate, the question will generally settle itself in the\r\nnext twenty-four hours, for if it be variola the papules will have\r\nundergone their specific development and the rubeolous elevations will\r\nhave become more decidedly macular.\r\n\r\nTyphus sometimes offers a certain resemblance to measles. According to\r\nBuchanan,[38] the eruption of typhus is occasionally, though not\r\ncommonly, a good deal like that of measles, and appears about the same\r\ntime after invasion. Coryza, when present and distinct, points to\r\nmeasles. The eruption of typhus is of a smaller pattern, discrete, and\r\nnot raised; that of measles, often coalescent, crescentic, and\r\nelevated. Subcuticular mottling is present in typhus, and absent in\r\nmeasles. The palatal mucous membrane should always be examined in\r\nsuspected measles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Art. \"Typhus\" in _Reynolds's System Med._, Am. ed., p.\r\n262.]\r\n\r\nAs I have never been able to convince myself of the existence of an\r\nindependent disease called roseola, I am at a loss to give the points\r\nof differential diagnosis; on the other hand, the various forms of\r\nsymptomatic erythema, occurring either as the result of numerous\r\nslight derangements of the system, or in connection with grave\r\nconstitutional disease, should be carefully considered. In the first\r\ngroup of cases the absence of premonitory symptoms, catarrh, etc., and\r\nthe presence of the smooth, rose-colored macules, mostly on the trunk,\r\nand in the latter the existence of symptoms belonging to the primary\r\ndisease, should prove of assistance. The erythema papulatum of\r\nnew-born children I have seen mistaken for measles, but the fact that\r\nrubeola is exceedingly rare in sucklings, and the absence of fever and\r\ncatarrhal disturbances, are sufficient grounds for a differential\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe erythematous syphilide (roseola syphilitica), particularly when\r\naccompanied by fever, may bear some resemblance to the rash of\r\nmeasles; but the history of the case, the circumscribed, indolent\r\ncharacter of the syphilide, in many instances sparing the face, the\r\nabsence of pathognomonic catarrhal symptoms of measles, and the\r\ncoexistence of other features of syphilis, are quite distinctive.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of normal uncomplicated measles is very\r\nfavorable. Thus, of 257 cases observed by Meigs and Pepper (_op.\r\ncit._), all terminated favorably. But in coming to any conclusion in\r\nregard to prognosis a number of different factors must be taken into\r\nconsideration. Among the more important are--the hygienic surroundings\r\nof the patient, the age, the nature of the complications, whether the\r\nmeasles be primary or secondary, and the character of the epidemic. In\r\nthe first place, rubeola in foundling hospitals and among the poorer\r\nclasses in large cities gives a larger ratio of deaths than among the\r\nwell-to-do members of the community. For instance, Bartels has shown\r\nthat catarrhal pneumonia, one {578} of the most frequent causes of\r\nmortality in this disease, is particularly prone to occur among those\r\ndwelling in crowded, poorly-ventilated houses. Then, again, the\r\nasylums and hospitals for children are peopled in many instances with\r\nthe victims of depraved constitutions, who readily succumb to\r\nintercurrent maladies.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of consideration sucklings under six months of age, in\r\nwhom measles is rare and said to be slight, most deaths from the\r\ndisease occur among very young children, from their greater liability\r\nto complications. According to Beddoes,[39] the mortality from measles\r\nis, beyond all comparison, greatest in the second year of life, and by\r\nthe tenth has become quite trifling. An examination of the statistics\r\nbearing on this question coincides with this general statement; but\r\nFox's tables, already quoted, would show that more infants under one\r\nyear of age die of measles than has hitherto been supposed. The\r\nsusceptibility to measles decreases with years, perhaps on account of\r\nthe fact that most adults have already contracted the disease; but\r\nwhen it does attack the unprotected adult it may prove fatal. This\r\nstatement is borne out by the large death-rate in the so-called camp\r\nmeasles of our late war.[40] The ravages of measles in virgin\r\ncommunities have been referred to in preceding pages. The general\r\ntemper of the epidemic must also be considered, since it is well\r\nrecognized that the essential character of epidemics differs much as\r\nto severity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Art. \"Mortality\" in _Quain's Dictionary Med._, p. 1002.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: In the general field hospital at Chattanooga the\r\ndeath-rate was 22.4 in 100 cases. In General Hospital No. 1, at\r\nNashville, it was 19.6 in 100, or nearly 1 in 5. Many died or became\r\npermanently disabled from the sequelæ (Bartholow).]\r\n\r\nSuch complications as diphtheria, catarrhal pneumonia, diarrhoea,\r\nconvulsions, etc. necessarily affect the prognosis of measles most\r\nseriously. More patients die of measles in the second than in the\r\nfirst week of the disease. The careful studies of temperature made by\r\nThomas, Bohn, and others show that an unusually high and increasing\r\nfever in the prodromal stage is of ill omen, particularly on the\r\nsecond and third days, and a fever heat measuring over 105° F. at any\r\nstage should be considered as very unfavorable.[41] Particularly to be\r\nfeared is continuation of the fever after the subsidence of the\r\neruption, or a sudden elevation after the normal curve has been\r\nreached. In fact, it is a safe rule to look upon all anomalies of the\r\ncurve with suspicion. Secondary measles, or measles grafted upon some\r\nserious existing affection, is particularly fatal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: In adolescence a body heat of 107° F. has been safely\r\npassed during the decline of measles with no marked complication\r\n(Squire).]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--There is no remedy which will destroy the susceptibility\r\nto measles. The future may develop some form of vaccination against\r\nrubeola, for, certainly, the hopes held out by the inoculation of\r\nmeasles upon the healthy subject have not been realized, as this\r\nprocedure merely reproduces the original complaint, without any\r\ndiminution in its intensity, and does not lessen the probability of\r\ncomplications (Mayr). The matter of carrying out a practical and\r\nefficient quarantine in measles is one of unusual difficulty, for the\r\nreason that the disease is capable of active propagation at a\r\ntime--the prodromal stage--when it is not yet sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic for positive diagnosis. But, as measles is by no means\r\nas trivial a disease as would seem to be the common impression, I hold\r\nit as a well-established principle of preventive medicine that a {579}\r\nstrict isolation should be enforced whenever, from the nature of the\r\ncase, it is at all possible; certainly, very young children and those\r\nsuffering from or showing a tendency to other diseases should be\r\njealously shielded from exposure.\r\n\r\nThe usual precautions as to disinfection and purification of the room,\r\nbedding, and utensils used by patients should be observed, as in other\r\ninfectious diseases. Squire is of opinion that there is danger of\r\npersonal infection for perhaps a month, and Hillairet that isolation\r\nfor forty days should be enjoined. It is quite certain that inunction\r\nlessens the danger of infection, and Kaposi[42] is authority for the\r\nstatement that a warm bath administered after the completion of\r\ndesquamation, or about fourteen days from the beginning of the attack,\r\nwill effectually prevent contagiousness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Pathologie u. Therapie der Hautkrankh._, Wien, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThe apartment occupied by a patient suffering from measles should be\r\nkept at a uniform temperature of from 66° to 70° F., and free\r\nventilation, at the same time avoiding draughts, should be enforced.\r\nThe room should be kept moderately dark. The bed-clothing should be\r\nlight, yet sufficiently warm, and the old notion of keeping the\r\npatient in a profuse sweat the better to bring out the eruption should\r\nbe discouraged. The diet should be bland and nutritious, and may\r\npreferably consist of milk, gruel, tapioca, and such like substances.\r\nAs convalescence progresses there may be a gradual return to more\r\nsubstantial food. The patient may be allowed cool water in moderation,\r\nas it is cruel and useless, and even harmful, to restrict one\r\nsuffering with fever to warm or sweetened drink. The patient should be\r\nconfined to his room until convalescence has been fully established,\r\nand should not be allowed to leave the house, both on his own account\r\nand that of others, until the usual health has been regained. Any of\r\nthe lingering results of the disease, such as bronchitis, otorrhoea,\r\nconjunctivitis, etc., should receive prompt attention; iron and\r\ncod-liver oil should be prescribed for the weakly and strumous, and\r\nregular hours of sleep, careful diet, and appropriate bathing and\r\nexercise should be advised. It may be said, without exaggeration, that\r\nneglect of the after-care of measles patients is, in some instances,\r\nmore to be deprecated than a similar neglect in the actual treatment\r\nof the disease itself.\r\n\r\nSince we are powerless to cut short an attack of measles by any\r\nremedial agents at present known to therapeutics, the intervention of\r\nthe physician is limited to assisting the cases through to a safe\r\ntermination. Quite a number of cases, as seen in private practice,\r\nrequire no special medicinal treatment, or at most one that is merely\r\nsymptomatic. The value of the so-called specific treatment, such as by\r\ncarbonate of ammonium, etc., has not been verified by experience.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary uncomplicated attacks, if the temperature should run high,\r\nin addition to the general rules as to diet and hygiene referred to\r\nbefore it will usually be found advisable to put the patient on some\r\ndiaphoretic mixture, to which may be added a mild opiate. I know of\r\nnothing better than the formula found in the work of Meigs and Pepper\r\non the _Diseases of Children_:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Potass. Citrat.    drachm i;\r\n      Spt. Ætheris Nit.  fl. drachm ii; {580}\r\n      Tr. Opii Deodorat. minim xii vel xxiv;\r\n      Syrupi             fl. drachm ii;\r\n      Aquæ               fl. oz. ii. M.\r\n\r\nS. A teaspoonful every two or three hours for a child of five years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAconite in small doses has been well spoken of in this connection, but\r\nI have no personal experience in its use. Bromide of potassium,\r\ntogether with a few drops of syrup of ipecac., dissolved in syrup of\r\nwild cherry, acts pleasantly both on the cough and the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe inunction of fatty substances, as originally proposed by\r\nSchonemann, and recently urged by Milton,[43] is an excellent routine\r\npractice, and in addition to adding very much to the patient's\r\ncomfort, has, perhaps, the merit of lessening somewhat the danger of\r\ninfection to others. For this purpose one may use leaf lard, cold\r\ncream, or vaseline, to each ounce of which it is well to add a few\r\nminims of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Archives of Dermatology_.]\r\n\r\nStimulants are rarely needed in uncomplicated measles, but Squire very\r\nwisely calls attention to the great value of wine in the depression\r\nfollowing upon the crisis.\r\n\r\nIn spite of some excellent authority to the contrary, I cannot see\r\nthat any benefit is to be derived from using severe measures to bring\r\nout an eruption that has undergone retrocession. As stated in another\r\npart of this article, the so-called striking-in of the rash is the\r\nresult of the supervention of some complication, and not the cause of\r\nit; therefore, a rational course of action would be to ascertain the\r\nnature of the complicating trouble, and to endeavor to correct it,\r\nwhich, at the same time, would be the very best means of restoring the\r\nnormal course of the disease.\r\n\r\nQuinia is of great value in controlling the excessively high\r\ntemperature which is sometimes observed either in connection with, or\r\nindependent of, complications. If the quinia should prove ineffectual\r\nor else be rejected by the patient, the physician should not hesitate\r\nto abstract heat by cold water in the shape of the wet pack or the\r\ngeneral bath. I think the latter method is to be preferred. It is but\r\nto employ the gradually cooled bath of Ziemssen, perhaps, commencing\r\nat 90° F. and going to 80° or 70° F. The condition of the patient, as\r\nascertained by the thermometer and also the state of the pulse, must\r\nbe the guide as to the duration and repetition of the baths. In\r\nGermany excellent results are claimed for the treatment of\r\nhyperpyrexia in measles by the cold pack, even when the excessive\r\ntemperature is due to such a complication as broncho-pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThere is little hope from therapeutical interference in malignant\r\nforms of measles, but the medical attendant should endeavor to reduce\r\ntemperature and support the strength by free stimulation and\r\nnourishing food.\r\n\r\nIt will now be advisable, at the risk of some repetition, to call\r\nattention to the treatment of some of the more prominent disturbances\r\nand complications of measles.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis, if severe, should be checked by cold applications and\r\nastringents. Plugging will rarely be found necessary. Trousseau\r\nrecommends the injection of water as hot as can be borne. Ergotine by\r\nthe mouth or hypodermically will sometimes prove highly valuable.\r\n\r\nThe lids should be anointed with vaseline or cold cream to prevent\r\ntheir sticking together, and it is well to occasionally evert them to\r\nsee that no {581} serious mischief has happened to the eye. If the\r\nconjunctivitis is intense, the discharges should be removed and cold\r\ncompresses applied.\r\n\r\nSince aural complications are due to extension of inflammation from\r\nthe oral and nasal cavities, Spencer urges the importance of early and\r\nsystematic treatment of these parts. He advises astringent\r\napplications (Monsell's solution 1 to 4 of glycerine) to the\r\npharyngeal mucous membrane. Ointments of boracic acid, zinc, or\r\niodoform are likewise useful when introduced through the nostril.\r\nEarache will require warm opiated poultices and inflation. Otorrhoea\r\nis best treated after the dry method.\r\n\r\nFor sickness of the stomach a spice poultice may be applied and small\r\nbits of ice given to suck. If constipation exist, a little oil or\r\nsyrup of rhubarb or some stewed prunes, or an enema, may be ordered.\r\nActive purgation should be withheld.\r\n\r\nThe early diarrhoea need give little concern, as it usually soon\r\nceases; but if it should persist, recourse must be had to more\r\nenergetic measures, such as the use of opium by mouth or enema, given\r\ncautiously in the case of children, vegetable and metallic\r\nastringents, and the application of hot poultices to the abdomen. The\r\ndiet should be carefully guarded.\r\n\r\nThe cough, even in mild cases, generally requires some slight\r\npalliative, such as syrup of ipecac., and an occasional small dose of\r\nDover's powder. Loeri very properly advises against the use of\r\nirritating expectorants. I think it advisable to keep the chest well\r\nsmeared with camphorated oil, over which should be worn an oil-silk\r\njacket. These simple measures, perhaps, diminish the tendency to\r\nthoracic complications. The sometimes violent paroxysms of false croup\r\nare very satisfactorily managed, after the manner of Graves, by gently\r\npressing a sponge, soaked in very hot water, under the chin and over\r\nthe front of the neck. When the dyspnoea is alarming, emetics, and the\r\ngeneral warm bath should be brought into requisition.\r\n\r\nConvulsions in the early stage require little treatment other than the\r\nwarm bath and appropriate doses of the bromide of potassium; occurring\r\nlater, they are very fatal under any treatment, as they generally\r\nsupervene in connection with some of the grave complications of the\r\ndisease. Chloral, preferably by enema, and chloroform may be tried.\r\nThe management of the severe bronchitis and pneumonia of measles\r\nrequires great care and circumspection on the part of the physician.\r\nThe application of a well-made flaxseed poultice, which should be\r\nneither too heavy nor too hot, is to be regarded as invaluable. To the\r\nflaxseed may be added a small quantity of mustard. Over the whole is\r\nto be placed an oil-silk jacket. Alcoholic stimulants, nourishing,\r\neasily-digested food, and expectorants containing carbonate of\r\nammonium are to be recommended.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of the other complications and sequelæ of measles\r\nthe reader is referred to the appropriate sections of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{582}\r\n\r\nRÖTHELN.[1]\r\n\r\nBY W. A. HARDAWAY, M.D.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the preparation of this article the author has\r\nconsulted the following authorities: Emminghaus, in _Gerhardt's Handb.\r\nder Kinderkrankh._, Zweiter Band, 1877; Thomas, in _Ziemssen's Cyclop.\r\nPract. Med._, vol. iii., Am. ed., 1875; Squire, in _Quain's Dict.\r\nMed._, 1883. References to current literature will be found in\r\nfoot-notes to the text.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Rubeola, Rubella, Roseola, Epidemic Roseola, German\r\nMeasles, French Measles, Hybrid Measles, False Measles, Rubeola\r\nMorbillosæ et Scarlatinosæ.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Rötheln is an acute infectious disease, presenting an\r\neruption of reddish macules upon the skin, accompanied by mild\r\ncatarrhal symptoms, and usually producing but slight disturbance of\r\nthe general system. It is self-protective, and occurs but once in the\r\nsame individual. It has no relationship to measles or scarlatina.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--A rapid glance at the interesting historical evolution of\r\nrötheln to a specific position among the acute infectious diseases is\r\nall that our space will allow. Some writers have attempted to show\r\nthat this affection was known to the Arabian physicians; but since it\r\nis only in comparatively recent times that the contagious epidemic\r\nexanthemata in general have been thoroughly differentiated, it is\r\nquite likely that the modern conception of it was not held by them nor\r\nby other medical men till many centuries later. Indeed, in our day,\r\nphysicians are yet to be found, though the number is rapidly\r\ndiminishing, who refuse to recognize in rötheln a distinctive specific\r\nmalady. Certain German observers in the middle of the last century (De\r\nBergen, 1752; Orlow, 1758) favored the idea of specificity, but these\r\nviews were soon disputed. In the years following a number of other\r\nphysicians announced their belief in the specific nature of rötheln,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, various noted authorities still insisted\r\nupon its connection with scarlet fever or measles. In 1815, Maton, an\r\nEnglish physician, most unequivocally declared that he had observed\r\ncases of an eruptive disorder which resembled neither measles,\r\nscarlatina, nor roseola, and which was worthy of a new designation.[2]\r\nIn the second and third decades of this century Hildebrand, and\r\nafterward the celebrated Schönlein, taught that rötheln was a hybrid\r\nof measles and scarlatina, although at this time Wagner (1834)\r\nadvocated the essential independence of rötheln. There is no doubt\r\nthat under the name of rubeola sine catarrho Willan, Bateman, and\r\nlater writers described what we now call rötheln, for they stated that\r\nthis variety of measles was not self-protective. Space will not allow\r\nof a detailed mention of the various writers who, during the first\r\nhalf of this century, {583} have contended for or against the autonomy\r\nof rötheln. It will be well to state, however, that Hebra, from the\r\nstandpoint of the dermatologist, very properly regards the manifold\r\nroseolæ of Willan as in many instances merely symptomatic erythemata,\r\nor else as irregular forms of measles or scarlatina; but he also fails\r\nto recognize the distinctive features of rötheln. Even so recent a\r\nwriter as Niemeyer declares that roseola arising from infection\r\nconsists in a modification of measles or scarlet fever. It is only in\r\nthe last twenty years that our present exact ideas of rötheln have\r\nobtained. For example, while Trousseau[3] asserts that rubeola\r\n(rötheln) is a perfectly distinct nosological species, he speaks of\r\nthe rash as appearing and disappearing alternately for some days, of\r\nits frequent recurrence in the same individual, etc. American\r\nphysicians were almost entirely ignorant of rötheln till within the\r\nlast ten years, when they were made acquainted with it through the\r\nmedium of a careful paper on the subject from the pen of J. Lewis\r\nSmith of New York.[4] Before this time, however, cases had been\r\ndescribed by Homans, Sr., of Boston (1845), and in 1853 and 1871 by\r\nCotting. Very few authorities now dispute the distinctive specific\r\nnature of rötheln; which statement is borne out by the fact that at\r\nthe last meeting of the International Medical Congress, held at London\r\nin 1881, there were but two dissentients to this view in the section\r\nbefore which it was discussed.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Squire, _Trans. Internat. Med. Congress_, London, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Clinical Medicine_, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Archives of Dermatology_, Oct., 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See especially Kassowitz's paper, \"Die Wirkliche Stellung\r\nder sogenannten Rubeola,\" etc., _Trans. Internat. Med. Cong._, 1881.]\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The contagium of rötheln is unknown, but that the disease\r\nis contagious has been fully demonstrated by numerous observations of\r\nepidemics and sporadic cases. From my own experience I should judge\r\nthat unprotected persons are not so susceptible of it as is known to\r\nbe the case under similar conditions in measles;[6] yet cases are\r\nrecorded which would prove that the contagion may be conveyed through\r\na third person and for some distance. It is probable that the vehicles\r\nof contagion are the same as in measles. At what period of its course\r\nthe disease is most capable of transmission has not been\r\nsatisfactorily determined. Squire is of the opinion, however, that the\r\ndisease is contagious before the appearance of the rash, and may\r\ncontinue so for some days or for two or three weeks. Rötheln may be\r\ncalled a disease of childhood for the same reason that the other\r\ncontagious exanthemata are--namely, that the majority of adults have\r\nalready been attacked. From an examination of available statistics I\r\nam inclined to regard the ages between five and fifteen--the years of\r\nschool attendance--as the period of life most susceptible of the\r\ninfluence of rötheln, although, of course, no time of life is entirely\r\nexempt. The non-susceptibility of sucklings, as in measles, holds true\r\nas a rule, although I am in a position to supply exceptions to this\r\nfrom my own experience, as well as from that of others. Sex seems to\r\nbe without influence in determining liability to the disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In this regard it resembles scarlatina more than measles,\r\nfor I have a number of times seen the disease introduced into\r\nfamilies, where it would attack one or two of a number equally\r\nexposed. J. L. Smith regards it as feebly contagious, and quotes\r\nChadbourne's experience to the same effect. Liveing declares that\r\nrötheln is more distinctly epidemic in Great Britain than either\r\nmeasles or scarlet fever, although probably less contagious.]\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is not very definitely settled, and, indeed,\r\n{584} owing to the generally trivial character of the affection,\r\nevidence on this point is difficult to obtain. Taken as a whole, it is\r\nprobably longer than is observed in measles. According to J. Lewis\r\nSmith, in the epidemic observed by him the incubation period varied\r\nfrom seven, or less than seven, to twenty-one days; Emminghaus places\r\nit at from two to three weeks; Thomas, from two and a half to three\r\nweeks; Squire, mostly a fortnight, the extreme being twenty-one days;\r\nCheadle, from eleven to twelve days.\r\n\r\nThere is nowhere recorded a trustworthy instance of a second attack of\r\nrötheln, although from analogy such an event is to be expected. As in\r\nmeasles, true recurrences of rötheln--that is, the result of a fresh\r\ninfection--are not to be confounded with relapses. I have never\r\nwitnessed a relapse, but cases of such a nature have been recorded by\r\nother observers (Lindwurm, Emminghaus, Körtlin, Kingsley).\r\n\r\nRötheln is a disease sui generis, and is in no way related to either\r\nmeasles or scarlatina; that is to say, it is not an irregular form of\r\neither of these nor a hybrid of them, nor has it ever been observed to\r\npropagate anything but itself. That it is not connected with any of\r\nthe symptomatic skin eruptions--the so-called roseolæ--is proved by\r\nits contagiousness and epidemic character. I quite agree with other\r\nobservers in declaring that rötheln has very little clinical\r\nresemblance to scarlatina, and that, on the other hand, in the\r\ngreatest number of cases the points of likeness are with measles. In\r\nthe section on diagnosis the differential points between rötheln,\r\nmeasles, and scarlatina will be considered; therefore in this place it\r\nwill only be necessary to call attention to certain general facts.\r\nThus, aside from the marked divergence in clinical\r\nsymptoms--incubation, invasion, fever, eruption, complications, and\r\nsequelæ--we are at once met by the positive fact that epidemics of\r\nrötheln, while always presenting identical features, prevail without\r\nregard to the existence of similar epidemics of measles and\r\nscarlatina--following or preceding them--and that attacks of rötheln\r\noffer no bar to the reception of their contagions, or vice versâ.\r\nLiterature is so full of examples of this statement that it need\r\nscarcely be dwelt upon. By way of illustration, however, the accurate\r\nobservations of J. Lewis Smith may be quoted in this connection. Of 48\r\ncases recorded by him prior to May 1st in the New York epidemic of\r\n1874, 19 had had measles. Rötheln in the N.Y. Foundling Hospital in\r\n1873-74 followed an epidemic of measles. During the epidemic of\r\n1880-81 the same fact was observed--namely, that a previous attack of\r\nmeasles, as well as scarlatina, afforded no protection from rötheln. I\r\ncould multiply such examples from my own experience. A single\r\ninteresting instance may be noted here. A physician asked the writer\r\nto examine his child, suffering, as he thought, from measles. A\r\ncareful investigation revealed a typical rötheln. A number of weeks\r\nlater an older child got measles, from which the rötheln patient\r\nacquired a characteristic attack of the same. In the following year\r\nboth children were taken with scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nThe only escape for those who would deny the autonomy of rötheln is in\r\nthe bold assertion that both measles and scarlatina more frequently\r\nrecur in the same individual than universal experience and observation\r\nwill allow; and this leaves them in the dilemma of determining to\r\nwhich group rötheln must be relegated. The hypothesis of the hybrid\r\nnature {585} of rötheln cannot be accepted by the pathologist nor the\r\nclinician, if for no other reason than that no one has ever seen\r\nrötheln generate anything but rötheln, and in no case give rise to\r\neither scarlatina or measles.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--As already stated, the probable average duration\r\nof the incubation period in rötheln is about fourteen days, varying,\r\nhowever, within the limits of from six to twenty-one days. In this\r\nrespect rötheln resembles scarlatina more than measles, the period of\r\nlatency in the latter observing considerable uniformity. No deviations\r\nfrom the general health are to be noted in the incubation stage.\r\n\r\nIn most cases prodromal symptoms are entirely absent, the presence of\r\nthe eruption being the first thing to show the existence of rötheln in\r\nthe system. On the other hand, in a certain proportion of cases there\r\nwill be present for a half day, or even longer, the general symptoms\r\nof malaise, such as slight nausea, some sore throat, pain in the\r\nlimbs, stiffness of the neck, etc. Vomiting is generally absent. J. L.\r\nSmith records one case of convulsions in the stage of invasion, and I\r\nhave notes of a single case in which the prodromal stage was initiated\r\nby mild delirium and fever, the latter anticipating the eruption for\r\ntwo days and a half, and disappearing when the rash came out. As\r\nThomas well observes, however, such cases are anomalous, and indicate\r\neither abnormal sensibility on the part of the patient or are due to a\r\nsecondary rötheln.\r\n\r\nMost observers (Emminghaus, Thomas, Smith, Squire) describe the rash\r\nas coming out in the order usual in measles--namely, first upon the\r\nface, scalp, and neck, then the trunk and arms, and finally the legs.\r\nOthers (Liveing, Morris) have stated that the rash first appears upon\r\nthe back and chest. In many cases in my own experience this has seemed\r\nto be true. It is quite probable that the situation of the exanthem in\r\nrötheln, as in measles and scarlatina, may present various\r\nirregularities; but I am inclined to believe that a careful\r\ninvestigation will in most instances show that the normal course of\r\nthe eruption is as first stated. Now, a marked characteristic of the\r\nrash of rötheln is that, unlike that of measles, there is no period,\r\nhowever short, in which its maximum is simultaneous over the whole\r\nbody; on the contrary, the eruption will have reached its full\r\ndevelopment upon the face, and will be almost or quite faded again,\r\nbefore the exanthem, for example, will have blossomed upon the trunk,\r\nand especially upon the lower extremities. The duration of the\r\neruption upon individual parts of the body is probably from a few\r\nhours to half a day at most (Thomas). A consideration of these facts\r\nexplains, according to Emminghaus, how different observers have\r\ndescribed the eruption as having its seat upon this or that region of\r\nthe body; in other words, it is probable that in a certain proportion\r\nof the cases in which the rash was supposed to have begun on the chest\r\nit had already run its course upon the face. The eruption usually\r\ncontinues altogether about four days, sometimes disappearing sooner,\r\nand sometimes being visible, especially as a fine mottling, for some\r\ndays longer. So far as the individual lesions of the eruption are\r\nconcerned, there is no question that they present, within a certain\r\nrange, varying aspects; and this clinical fact has been taken\r\nadvantage of by the opponents of the idea of specificity in order to\r\nmake it appear that the disease is not sui generis, inasmuch as it\r\nlacks uniformity of expression. Such an argument wants force when we\r\nconsider that in making up a given diagnosis we lay stress {586} not\r\nupon special, but upon the ensemble of, symptoms. For example, no one\r\nwould deny to measles an independent position because the eruption, as\r\nis well known, may assume this or that form (morbilli lævis, m.\r\npapulosi, etc.); on the contrary, we recognize a particular case or\r\nseries of cases to be measles from a due appreciation of all the\r\nsymptoms present. So it is to be expected that while the cutaneous\r\nlesions will present a certain similarity of feature, as they do,\r\nthere will also exist minor differences in detail.\r\n\r\nIn the greatest number of cases in my own experience the exanthem is\r\ncomposed of ill-defined, roundish, punctate macules, without special\r\ngrouping. These are usually discrete, but in certain situations they\r\nmay coalesce. The color is of a pale rosy red, quite difficult to\r\ndescribe, but less purplish than in measles, and not so livid a red as\r\nin scarlatina. I have occasionally observed large irregular spots not\r\nunlike those of measles.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: According to Emminghaus (_op. cit._, p. 345), the\r\neruption generally forms roseolæ of pin-head, lentil, or small bean\r\nsize. They are mostly round, sometimes oval, and bordered by\r\nwell-defined or by blurred edges. The intervening skin is not always\r\nunchanged, for here and there we find upon it small dilated\r\nblood-vessels, and from the spots processes extend with a certain\r\nregularity to other spots in such a way as to give the skin a marbled\r\nappearance.]\r\n\r\nThomas distinguishes three types of eruption--one with large spots,\r\nwhich is rare; one with medium-sized spots; and one with small spots.\r\nEmminghaus describes a discrete and a more confluent variety. I have\r\nobserved one case where the maculæ on the back had undergone a\r\nvesicular transformation. Others have mentioned this occurrence.\r\nItching of the skin is marked in some cases, and a fine desquamation\r\nis observed after the rash, but by no means invariably.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membranes are implicated to a slight degree in rötheln, but\r\nthe amount of involvement varies considerably. In some cases that I\r\nhave observed the catarrh of the mucous membranes has been barely\r\nappreciable. As a rule, however, the eyes are somewhat suffused, and\r\nthere is slight lachrymation and photophobia. Sneezing may be noted,\r\nbut there is little discharge from the nose. Sore throat is not\r\nuncommon, perhaps the most constant feature, and, according to\r\nLiveing, is apt to persist after the subsidence of the rash. The\r\nfauces are injected, and the tonsils are red and swollen, but with no\r\nevidence of ulceration. J. Lewis Smith and others state that the\r\nbuccal mucous membrane shows a more or less diffuse patchy and spotted\r\nredness. The tongue may be, and usually is, covered by a white fur,\r\nthrough which protrude a few enlarged red papillæ. There may be slight\r\ncough. Loeri[8] describes the mucous membranes of the pharynx, larynx,\r\nand trachea as presenting a spotted or uniform hyperæmia. There is no\r\nmarked participation of the intestines in the catarrh. Some few\r\nwriters have noted a transient albuminuria, but it is safe to say that\r\nsuch cases are entirely anomalous, if not, indeed, in some instances,\r\nexamples of mistaken diagnosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Jahrb. f. Kinderk._, xix. Bd., 1 Heft.]\r\n\r\nA very constant feature is the swelling of the lymphatic glands of the\r\nneck, especially those back of the sterno-mastoid; the swellings may\r\ncome on before the rash appears. In all the cases that have fallen\r\nunder my notice this symptom has not been absent in a single instance.\r\nLess constantly, and it would seem in proportion to the development of\r\nthe rash, engorgement of the glands may be noted elsewhere.\r\n\r\n{587} There is but slight disturbance of the temperature in rötheln,\r\nand when it does occur it is usually limited to the first few hours of\r\nthe eruption. This has been the rule in my observation, and certainly\r\nholds good for the majority of cases. In a minority, varying degrees\r\nof fever may be present; thus, the temperature may reach 102° F. or\r\n103° F., and then rapidly sink by the second day of the disease, or,\r\nhaving fallen a degree, it may continue at this point till the\r\nsubsidence of the rash, or, it is said, may retain its initial height\r\ntill the end of the disease. During the following week Squire states\r\nthat the temperature may be readily disturbed--either elevated by\r\nexertion or depressed by fatigue or chill. A relapse or recrudescence\r\nof the rash may be looked for at this time.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Cheadle (_Trans. Internat. Med. Congress_, London, 1881)\r\nhas reported an epidemic of rötheln of a very severe type, all the\r\nsymptoms of the disease as ordinarily recognized being very much\r\nexaggerated.]\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--In the vast majority of cases neither\r\ncomplications nor sequelæ have been observed in connection with\r\nrötheln. J. Lewis Smith has recorded instances of diphtheritic\r\ninflammation as a complication, which, however, as he justly remarks,\r\nmay, when prevalent, attack any inflamed surface. Pneumonia and\r\nbronchitis have been occasionally reported as complicating or\r\nfollowing rötheln. Liveing and Duckworth mention albuminuria, but, so\r\nfar as I know, they are alone in this experience. I have known\r\notorrhoea and ciliary blepharitis to occur as sequelæ. It would not be\r\na matter of surprise that in weakly children various chronic ailments\r\nshould be set up by rötheln, as by any other disturbance of the\r\ngeneral health.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--There is no other disease which so much resembles rötheln\r\nas measles. Especially is this true of atypical cases occurring\r\nsporadically. In rötheln the whole course of the disease is much\r\nmilder than in measles, the incubation is longer as a rule, and the\r\nfact of a previous attack of rubeola is of much importance, since we\r\nknow that recurrences are very rare. In measles there is a prodromic\r\nperiod, having a characteristic temperature curve, and presenting\r\npathognomonic catarrhal symptoms, which precedes the eruption for\r\nthree or four days; in rötheln the appearance of the rash is often the\r\nfirst sign of the affection. The sore throat of rötheln resembles that\r\nseen in scarlatina more than the angina of measles, and the general\r\ncatarrhal implication of the mucous membranes, so marked a feature of\r\nmeasles, is either absent in rötheln or exists to a very trivial\r\nextent. Measles is essentially a febrile disease, having a peculiar\r\ntype of fever; rötheln may run its whole course without appreciable\r\nrise of temperature. As will be seen in the preceding pages, the\r\ndevelopment and progress of the exanthem of measles differs materially\r\nfrom that witnessed in rötheln. In measles the lesions are larger,\r\nmore vivid, more angular and indented, more frequently provided with\r\nprocesses, and therefore more apt to assume the crescentic\r\narrangement, than in rötheln. Finally, it must be urged that the tout\r\nensemble of the case should be taken into consideration, and not some\r\nspecial feature of the skin eruption.\r\n\r\nThe incubation period of scarlet fever is much shorter than in\r\nrötheln, and all of the constitutional symptoms are, as a rule,\r\ninfinitely graver. In scarlatina there is a febrile invasion stage of\r\ntwenty-four hours; in rötheln, if fever is present at all, it is most\r\ngenerally simultaneous with {588} the rash, and rapidly disappears,\r\nwhile in the former it persists for a number of days longer. Vomiting\r\nis common in scarlet fever, rare in rötheln. In scarlet fever the\r\nlymphatic glands are notably involved at the angles of the jaw, in\r\nrötheln at the sides and back of the neck. Sore throat is a feature\r\ncommon to both scarlet fever and rötheln, but it is very much less\r\nmarked in the latter. Thomas[10] says that in scarlatina only the\r\nposterior parts, the uvula, the arches of the palate and their\r\nvicinity are affected, while in rötheln the anterior parts are also\r\naffected, and both in much the same degree. In scarlet fever the rash,\r\nwhich mostly begins on the neck and chest, is made up of large patches\r\nformed of minute red spots on a bright-red hyperæmic base; in rötheln\r\nthe eruption is composed of roundish pea-sized macules, with normal\r\nintegument intervening. In cases of doubt--for example, when the rash\r\nof rötheln consists of very small spots which have become\r\nconfluent--the further development and persistence of the scarlatinal\r\nefflorescence, the temperature, the pulse, the angina, and the\r\ncharacter of the desquamation must be taken into consideration. The\r\ncomplications and sequelæ are very different in the two diseases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Article \"Scarlatina,\" _op. cit._]\r\n\r\nThe symptomatic eruptions of the skin which pass under the name of\r\nroseola bear no resemblance to rötheln. They usually occur as the\r\nresult of some trivial derangement of the system or in the course of\r\nsome primary affection. They are not contagious, the lymphatic glands\r\nand the mucous membranes are not involved, and the rash is quite\r\ndifferent in character.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of simple uncomplicated rötheln is\r\ninvariably good. Complications arising in delicate children\r\nnecessarily affect the prognosis, as would any other disturbance of\r\nthe general health.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Simple cases of rötheln require no treatment, as the\r\npatients are rarely sick enough to be confined to bed. Graver forms of\r\nthe disease must be met by such measures as are indicated by the\r\nsymptoms present. The after-management must be conducted on general\r\nprinciples having reference to the previous and present condition of\r\nthe person attacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{589}\r\n\r\nMALARIAL FEVERS.\r\n\r\nBY SAMUEL M. BEMISS, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the medical nomenclature of this country the term malaria is\r\nsynonymous with swamp or ague poison.\r\n\r\nMalarial affections, therefore, comprise all those diseases or morbid\r\nmanifestations which the swamp poison produces in the human organism.\r\n\r\nThis article is not designed to notice in a systematic manner any of\r\nthese disorders which are not properly classifiable under the head of\r\nmalarial fevers. It will, however, be necessary to make such\r\nreferences to the pathology of chronic malarial toxæmia as may serve\r\nto explain the influence this condition exerts in occasioning\r\ndepartures from type in the febrile attacks.\r\n\r\nWhen a poison generated outside the human system obtains admission to\r\nit, and produces deleterious effects, three questions naturally arise:\r\nWhat is the essential character and natural history of this noxious\r\nagent? How does it obtain access to the human system? What is its mode\r\nof action when received?\r\n\r\nIn reference to the first of these questions, it must be admitted that\r\nthe substantive essentiality of the malarial poison remains as yet\r\nundemonstrated. It is true, however, that the attempts at an objective\r\nstudy of this poison by means of the microscope and the cultivating\r\nretort point to the conclusion that it is an organism.\r\n\r\nIts subjective or analogical study affords quite incontestable\r\nevidence in support of this conclusion. The leading features in the\r\nnatural history of malaria are closely coincident with those of\r\ncertain known organisms. It requires for its production suitable\r\nconditions of moisture, temperature, and a properly circumstanced\r\nbreeding-place. Within certain bounds these conditions are requisite\r\nto the life and perpetuity of all organisms.\r\n\r\nAgain, when all the above-enumerated conditions correspond apparently\r\nin the most favorable degree, their continuous concurrence for a lapse\r\nof time is necessary before the poison manifests its presence. It is\r\nnot improbable that this period of development may differ in different\r\nclimates, but in this country we assume it to be about thirty days. If\r\nthese facts related to some noxious organism visible to the eye, no\r\ndoubt would be entertained that the presence of its germs in the\r\nplaces where it appeared was the indispensable condition. It would\r\nthen follow that the concurrence of suitable meteorologic and telluric\r\nconditions with sufficient time for its growth and maturity were\r\nmerely accessories to its perfect development. According to this\r\ntheory, the coincidence of five circumstances is necessary before\r\nmalaria can be fully matured--viz.: Its own {590} specific germ;\r\nsuitable soil or pabulum; suitable moisture; suitable temperature;\r\nsufficient time for its growth and development.\r\n\r\nCertain physical qualities which pertain to the malarial poison can\r\nalso be profitably made points of subjective study. These are very\r\nclosely connected with the answer to the second question, or \"How the\r\nmalarial poison obtains access to the human system.\" They will\r\ntherefore be briefly noticed in relation to the instrumentality of\r\neach in conveying malaria into the system.\r\n\r\nThe first to be mentioned is ponderability, which the following facts\r\nprove that malaria possesses:\r\n\r\nThose different atmospheric states which affect the range of diffusion\r\nof known air-borne yet ponderable substances exert similar influences\r\nupon the malarial poison.\r\n\r\nAltitude illustrates the ponderability of malaria by powerfully\r\nretarding its diffusion.\r\n\r\nHigh readings of the barometer favor its aërial dissemination.\r\n\r\nFogs, smoke, dust, or floating particles presumably more buoyant than\r\nthis poison may exert greater or less influence in overcoming the\r\nobstacle which ponderability attaches to malaria as an air-borne\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nCurrents of air passing continuously and steadily in one direction\r\nover the breeding-places of malaria increase the limits and intensity\r\nof toxic range.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is undoubtedly the medium by means of which malarial\r\npoison is most frequently brought into the human system. Liability to\r\nintoxication is increased in direct ratio to the proximity of points\r\nof exposure to places of development; to similarity of level; to\r\nsituation in the line of prevailing winds which have traversed the\r\nbreeding-ground; and, lastly, to the extent and fertility of the\r\nlocality of production.\r\n\r\nWhether malaria passes through the respiratory apparatus directly into\r\nthe circulation, or is lodged upon the fauces and absorbed through\r\nsome other surface, is not clearly ascertainable. It is certainly not\r\ndeprived of its noxious qualities by stomach digestion, and therefore,\r\nsometimes at least, may reach the blood through the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nMalaria is miscible with water. It is capable of being carried by\r\ncurrents of water through distances and periods of time altogether\r\nundetermined, without losing either its toxic effects or, perhaps, the\r\nfaculty of reproduction. It is more than likely that this means of\r\nconveyance has effected its distribution to continents and islands too\r\nwidely separated to justify a belief that it was wind-wafted. No\r\nobservations need be adduced to establish the water-borne habit of the\r\nmalarial poison, or the positive liability to its toxic effects when\r\nreceived into the stomach through this medium. These facts have been\r\nwell understood from the time of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nThe matter of communicability of malaria by means of drinking water\r\nshould not be dismissed without some allusion to the great probability\r\nthat other fluids or solids are open to a similar charge. There is a\r\nwidespread popular prejudice, especially notable in the southern part\r\nof the United States, that drinking milk occasions attacks of the\r\nendemic fevers. It is the usual custom to pour the evening supply of\r\nmilk into broad uncovered pans, and allow it to remain exposed in the\r\nopen air for {591} consumption at the morning meal. This viscid fluid,\r\nso tenacious of ordinary air-borne particles, may well be suspected of\r\nentangling sufficient quantities of swamp poison to produce sickness\r\nif exposed where it is rife during a whole night.\r\n\r\nA similar popular prejudice exists in regard to the muscadine grape,\r\nwhich flourishes best in swampy localities. The rough skin of this\r\nfruit, frequently covered with its own juice, offers favorable\r\nconditions for the adhesion of air-borne particles.\r\n\r\nThe malarial poison is not reproduced within the human system. This\r\nproposition is undeniable, since no intensification of the poison is\r\nproduced by any degree of crowding of the sick which can be practised;\r\nneither do any conditions of contact with the sick ever impart\r\nmalarial affections.\r\n\r\nMalarial poison is specific. This allegation is sufficiently\r\nestablished by its specific effects on the human economy. There is no\r\nother agent known which is capable of originating morbid phenomena\r\ncharacterized by such marked diurnal periodicity.\r\n\r\nIt is not interchangeable with other specific poisons. This statement\r\nmay be rested upon all fairly collected clinical observations.\r\n\r\nThere are no facts which justify the belief that malaria is capable of\r\nbecoming mixed in the atmosphere, or outside the system, with any\r\nother specific morbific germ, so as to produce a third something which\r\nmay give rise to compound forms of disease.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the second question which is best supported is, that the\r\nmalarial poison is brought into the system principally by breathing an\r\natmosphere impregnated with this miasm.\r\n\r\nIt is also ingested by being held in suspension in fluids used as\r\ndrink or food; perhaps also by eating certain fruits or vegetables in\r\ntheir natural state whose external surfaces afford favorable\r\nconditions for its lodgment.\r\n\r\nMORBID EFFECTS AND PHENOMENA WHICH FOLLOW ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE\r\nHUMAN SYSTEM.--The discussion of the morbid process established by the\r\nmalarial poison involves some difficult problems. A period of\r\nincubation must be admitted to follow the inception of the ague germs.\r\nBut this period has no definitely marked limits. Perhaps it is a\r\nshifting one, according to the quantity or quality of the poison\r\nreceived, or the sudden or gradual manner in which it is received, or\r\nthe state of receptivity of the system.\r\n\r\nCertain facts seem to indicate very clearly that malarial poison is\r\nvery slowly removed from a system which has been brought under its\r\ninfluence. These evidences of long systemic residence of the poison\r\nare principally displayed in those attacks which occur after long\r\nperiods of removal from any surrounding where intoxication was\r\npossible. Vernal attacks may be classed in the same connection. In\r\nmany instances the subjects of these long-delayed attacks have never\r\nsuffered a paroxysmal seizure, and yet when some accidental\r\nderangement of health occurs, as from a fit of indigestion or a sudden\r\nwetting, they fall sick with one or another form of malarial fever.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear to me that we are justified in assuming that such\r\nattacks as I refer to are to be ascribed to secondary changes produced\r\nin either the fluids or solids of the system by the malarial poison.\r\nIn so {592} far as the clinical phenomena are worth anything in\r\ndemonstrating the presence and agency of the specific malarial poison\r\nin these deferred attacks, they are precisely similar to those\r\nobserved in paroxysms arising after a few hours' or a few days'\r\nexposure to marsh miasm.\r\n\r\nBut we find further proofs of the long-continued and silent manner in\r\nwhich malaria exerts its pathological influences in those enlargements\r\nof the spleen which occur without specific attacks of sickness. The\r\nalterations of nutrition in this organ are so characteristic of\r\nmalaria that they can scarcely be supposed to depend upon those\r\nchances which determine the nature of secondary blood-impurities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntermittent Fever--Simple Forms.\r\n\r\nThe clinical phenomena of intermittent fevers afford strong support to\r\nthe opinion that this type of malarial attacks illustrates more\r\nstrongly than any other the primary influence of the poison upon the\r\nhuman system. Fits of ague often occur very shortly after exposure in\r\ninfected localities, and the persons thus suddenly attacked may\r\npresent little or no evidence of cachexia before or after the\r\nparoxysm. Indeed, they frequently resume their ordinary avocations\r\nafter the paroxysms, apparently as well as if they had not occurred.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore my opinion that the pathology of an intermittent fever\r\ndoes not necessarily involve an hypothesis that the attacks are the\r\nresults of certain changes which the poison undergoes after its\r\ninception, nor, on the other hand, that certain perversions of\r\nsystemic chemistry are required to inaugurate the paroxysms.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these conclusions, it seems likely that the\r\nphenomena of intermittent malarial fever result from the primary\r\neffects of its specific poison exerted directly upon the fluids and\r\nsolids of the system, and disturbing their functions, and especially\r\nthe nerve-function.\r\n\r\nThose malarial attacks which ensue almost immediately after exposure\r\nare principally manifested in persons exposed at points of unusually\r\nabundant evolution. The rule of malarial attacks in temperate\r\nlatitudes is, that they require repeated exposure to infection for\r\ntheir production. The long residence of the poison in the system may\r\nrender additional doses possible, until a point of saturation is\r\nreached which occasions paroxysmal explosions. In these cases the\r\nperiod of incubation is reckoned from the first date of exposure, thus\r\nforming the most striking contrast with the incubative periods of the\r\ncases occurring almost immediately after exposure.\r\n\r\nWhether the quiescent period after exposure to malaria be long or\r\nshort, attacks are seldom abrupt in their announcement. The symptoms\r\nwhich usually precede pronounced attacks consist, for the most part,\r\nin some derangement of the functions presided over by the organic\r\nnervous system. Derangement of digestion, vitiated taste, coating of\r\nthe tongue, loaded urine, and sallow skin are ordinarily found among\r\nthe prodromic symptoms. Next in succession come feelings of malaise,\r\nhot and cold flushes, and those neuralgias which precede and attend\r\nmalarial paroxysms.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of an ordinary or typical malarial paroxysm are so\r\ncharacteristic, as to be generally readily interpreted. Creeping,\r\nchilly, {593} sensations over the surface, especially along the spine,\r\nyawning, livid coloration beneath the finger-nails, retreat of blood\r\nfrom superficial capillaries, and that consequent papillary elevation\r\nwhich is commonly called goose-skin, comprise the earliest symptoms.\r\nThen decided shiverings with chattering of the teeth come on, and the\r\npatient asks for blankets to be heaped upon him and hot applications\r\nto be made, even though the atmospheric temperature may be decidedly\r\nelevated.\r\n\r\nNausea and vomiting are frequent symptoms, no doubt due to the fact\r\nthat the portal system of blood-vessels is so often the seat of\r\ncongestion during a chill. No intelligent practitioner can watch a\r\npatient during the cold stage of a malarial paroxysm without realizing\r\nhow important the attendant congestion is as a pathological state. It\r\nshould first be considered that every chill necessarily implies a\r\ncondition of congestion in some part of the system. The blood driven\r\nfrom the surface and extremities must be accounted for elsewhere; and\r\nthe amount of blood which is lost from one part of the circulatory\r\ntree must correspond with that accumulated elsewhere. But in treating\r\nof the pernicious forms of malarial fevers this question will again\r\nreceive notice.\r\n\r\nIn our present state of knowledge we are no more able to explain those\r\nperversions of the normal action of the physical forces of the system\r\nwhich occasion the phenomena of a chill than we are to explain how the\r\naltered circulation in the first steps of an inflammation is brought\r\nabout. The theory which Cullen adopted is quite as explanatory and\r\nconsistent as any which has been promulgated since his time. According\r\nto this, a state of spasm of the arterioles and capillaries causes the\r\nchill, while the fever is merely the rebound of functions held in\r\nabeyance during the chill.\r\n\r\nAfter a variable length of time there occurs a change in these\r\nsymptoms: the patient begins to remove the blankets which covered him;\r\nthe face shows signs of returning circulation; the veins of the whole\r\nsurface gradually fill again, apparently beyond their normal state.\r\nBut the reaction goes far beyond any normal physiological state. The\r\nface becomes flushed and the eyes injected, and the patient complains\r\nof headache, thirst, dryness and heat of the surface; he will not\r\npermit any covering, and constantly shifts his place in the bed in the\r\nhope that some new position may afford him more comfort. Nausea and\r\nvomiting are commonly present. If the fever runs high, delirium is apt\r\nto occur. The thermometer seldom shows a temperature above 105°, but I\r\nhave seen 106.5° recorded in the axilla in the hot stage of a paroxysm\r\nof simple intermittent fever.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the hot stage is different in different cases.\r\nAccording to Aitken, the mean duration is three to eight hours.\r\n\r\nThere is a very old and quite well-supported opinion, that the cold\r\nstage is shorter in the quotidian than in the tertian type, and also\r\nthat the hot stage is longer in the former than in the latter. It may\r\ncertainly be affirmed that in individual cases of either type there is\r\nno fixed relation between the duration of the chill and that of the\r\nhot stage.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the hot stage begins by the appearance of a gentle\r\nperspiration, limited at first to the forehead, face, and neck. This\r\ngradually extends itself over the surface and increases in quantity\r\nuntil the whole body is bathed in a profuse sweat. During this period\r\nthe {594} patient's symptoms, both subjective and objective, undergo\r\nwonderful mitigation, and, although this stage is usually short, it\r\noften happens that by the time it is concluded a restoration to\r\nordinary health seems to have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe sweating stage terminates a malarial paroxysm. The intermission\r\nnow begins, and lasts until the inauguration of another paroxysm. The\r\nintermission is longer or shorter accordingly, first, as the paroxysm\r\noccupies less or more time; and, second, as the interval may affect\r\nit. The interval is that period of time which reaches from the\r\nbeginning of one paroxysm to the beginning of another. It therefore\r\nfurnishes the basis of classification of simple intermittents into the\r\nfollowing forms: quotidian, tertian, and quartan.\r\n\r\nStatistics gathered from a great many sources and relating to many\r\ncountries and climates indicate that quotidian intermittents are more\r\ncommon than tertian. It may then be assumed that the natural type of\r\nintermittents is that form characterized by diurnal paroxysms. It must\r\nbe remarked, however, that if any natural law does exist establishing\r\nthe quotidian as the typical form of intermittent fevers, it is very\r\noften set aside by unknown influences. In certain epidemics the\r\ntertian cases preponderate, and under all circumstances convertibility\r\nmay be witnessed between the various forms.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the statistics gathered by the medical staff of\r\nthe United States Army during the late Civil War afford the most\r\nvaluable data which we possess touching these points, in so far as\r\nthey relate to this country. During three years of the war 724,284\r\ncases of intermittent fever were recorded, tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\nQuotidian, 370,401 cases, 388 deaths--equivalent to 1047 + deaths per\r\n1,000,000 cases.\r\n\r\nTertian, 318,704 cases, 324 deaths--equivalent to 1007 + deaths per\r\n1,000,000 cases.\r\n\r\nQuartan, 35,179 cases, 79 deaths--equivalent to 2245 + deaths per\r\n1,000,000 cases.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by several writers that quartan attacks have a\r\nsmaller ratio in the Southern States than in other parts of the Union.\r\nMy observations on this point have not been sufficiently well recorded\r\nto make them especially authoritative, but they support such a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe morbid anatomy of malarial fevers is more properly discussed in\r\ntreating of the graver forms, since the paroxysms of simple\r\nintermittent do not often occasion death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--This must necessarily vary with the stage of the paroxysm\r\nand condition of the patient at the time of the first visit.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose this to be the incipiency of the paroxysm, or the early\r\npart of the cold stage. However little the danger to life from the\r\nparoxysm of a simple intermittent attack, the practitioner should not\r\nforget that whatever danger does exist is to be ascribed to damages\r\nsuffered during or in consequence of the chill. There are few\r\nexceptions to this rule, and those will be noticed presently. With\r\nthis fact in view the practitioner's duties are much simplified. He\r\nshould first endeavor to remove any complications present which tend\r\nto aggravate the cold stage. If the chill has come on after a full\r\nmeal or after eating indigestible food, the stomach should be promptly\r\nemptied; otherwise the cold stage will {595} be prolonged and rendered\r\nmore violent. Large draughts of warm water will frequently produce\r\nsufficient emesis. If this should fail, ipecacuanha may be added. The\r\nwarm infusion of eupatorium perfoliatum answers well as an emetic,\r\nproducing also a laxative effect. But it is disgusting to the palate,\r\nand sometimes prolongs its action beyond desired results. The effect\r\nof an emetic in abridging a chill by revulsive action are uncertain,\r\nand I avoid resorting to them for this purpose alone in simple\r\nintermittents.\r\n\r\nThe patient's subjective complaints of suffering should receive a due\r\ndegree of attention. Additional blankets and warm applications should\r\nbe allowed when solicited. I always discourage hot or heating drinks,\r\nexcept for the purpose just mentioned. I especially oppose alcoholic\r\nstimulants, because they seldom do any good in mitigating the chill,\r\noftener aggravating the patient's symptoms during the hot stage,\r\nparticularly the headache and vomiting, and sometimes directly\r\noccasioning perplexing perturbations. For example, I have seen\r\nconvulsions speedily follow a strong brandy toddy given to shorten a\r\nchill.\r\n\r\nWhile the removal of complications is imperatively indicated, it is\r\nalso important to use promptly those means which are designed to\r\nmodify and shorten the chill. It is a remarkable fact that all the\r\nagents found to be useful for this purpose are such as directly\r\ninfluence nervous function. Opium in some form enters into all\r\nprescriptions which I have found efficient in modifying a chill. It is\r\nquite efficacious when given alone, but I think its therapeutic energy\r\nand certainty are increased by the addition of other agents of the\r\nsame class. I have often exhibited twenty to thirty drops of\r\nchloroform with an equal quantity of laudanum with excellent results.\r\nThe tincture of opium may be combined with aromatic spirit of ammonia,\r\nor with bromide of potassium, or with chloral hydrate. In combination\r\nwith either of the latter medicines it may be given by rectal\r\ninjection. If the stomach is intolerant, or by preference because of\r\nfacility of dosage and quickness of effect, the opiate may be given\r\nhypodermically. For this purpose one-sixth to one-quarter of a grain\r\nof morphia may be given, together with one-sixtieth to one-fortieth of\r\na grain of atropia. It is rarely necessary to repeat the dose\r\nwhichever form may be adopted.\r\n\r\nAfter much experience in these methods of mitigating and abridging the\r\nchills of intermittent fever, I feel entitled to say that, whether the\r\nobjects be achieved or not, no injurious consequences ensue.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the circulatory and digestive organs are not\r\nfavorable for the introduction of quinia or of any preliminary\r\npurgative which may be supposed to be necessary, and I therefore delay\r\ntheir exhibition. It may be excepted, however, that sometimes a very\r\nobstinately irritable stomach or exceedingly vitiated state of the\r\nfluids can be appropriately met by gr. x to xx of calomel.\r\n\r\nThe hot stage of a simple intermittent seldom calls for medical\r\ninterference on account of excessive temperature. If the headache is\r\nvery violent or the vomiting troublesome, a subcutaneous dose of\r\nmorphia will bring speedy relief. The existence of high temperature\r\ndoes not contra-indicate its use.\r\n\r\nI am in the habit of giving opium in the following combinations:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Morphiæ Acet.     gr. ss;\r\n      Liq. Ammon. Acet. fl. oz. iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. Two tablespoonfuls every second hour.\r\n\r\n{596} Or, occasionally, the following:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Sodii Bicarb.          gr. xx.\r\n      Morphiæ Sulph.         gr. i;\r\n      Aquæ Lauro-Cerasi,\r\n      Aquæ Menth. Pip. _aa._ fl. drachm iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. Teaspoonful pro re nata.\r\n\r\nI do not limit the use of opiates in the hot stage to old and infirm\r\nsubjects, as Dickson suggests, but give them in all cases where\r\nvomiting, headache, or other neuralgias are excessive, or where\r\nunusual restlessness and jactitation are present.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of giving purgatives as a preliminary measure of\r\ntreatment during the hot stage must be determined by symptoms\r\nconnected with individual cases. In the majority of cases falling\r\nunder my care purgatives are avoided. When regarded necessary, gentle\r\npurgation is solicited by administering bitartrate of potassium in\r\nlemonade or by combining mild mercurial doses with antiperiodics when\r\nthese latter are resorted to during the fever. In some cases a very\r\nfurred tongue, sallow skin, and costive bowels indicate more active\r\npurgatives, which may be exhibited during the febrile stage.\r\n\r\nThe most important question which relates to medication during the hot\r\nstage is in respect to the administration of antiperiodics. It may be\r\nsafely stated that practitioners of this country were the first to\r\nadopt this method of procedure in malarial fevers. Here it has been\r\nwell demonstrated that a competent dose of quinia, given during any\r\npart of the hot stage, is so often followed by the defervescence of\r\nthe fever that it would be illogical to attribute the change to any\r\nother cause. Sometimes the remedy fails in producing this result; then\r\nexcessive physiological disturbances may follow, and perhaps some\r\ngeneral aggravation of the patient's symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere are four different circumstances, each of which, in my opinion,\r\ncalls for the exhibition of quinia during the hot stage, whether the\r\nfever has reached its maximum point or not:\r\n\r\n_First._ If the period which has elapsed since the beginning of the\r\nparoxysm is so considerable that further delay might prevent\r\nsufficient cinchonism to intercept the next accession.\r\n\r\n_Second._ When the fever is so excessive that quinia should be given\r\nas an antipyretic.\r\n\r\n_Third._ When apprehensions exist that the fever will occasion some\r\ncomplication or accident.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ When the tongue is clean and the state of the system is\r\nfavorable to absorption.\r\n\r\nThe hot stage is not usually favorable to absorption, and consequently\r\nthe economical use of quinia must not be attempted. It should be given\r\nin doses varying from ten to twenty grains, preferably in solution. I\r\nmay remark that I have seldom failed in getting good results from the\r\npowder or pills if lemonade or some fluid facile of absorption be\r\ngiven at the same time. The mixtures previously formulated answer this\r\npurpose very well, and at the same time mitigate the disagreeable\r\nphysiological effects of the quinia.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to certain symptoms occasionally connected\r\n{597} with the hot stage which involve danger. Convulsions are among\r\nthe most important of these. They occur most often among children, but\r\noccasionally with adults. They should be met by chloroform, cold to\r\nthe head, hypodermic injection of morphia, and cupping or leeching if\r\nthe face is flushed, the eyes injected, and the carotids pulsating\r\nforcibly.\r\n\r\nThe sweating stage may be classed with the intermission in respect to\r\nmedication. No time should be lost in securing cinchonism. From the\r\nmoment the sweating stage announces itself the fluids of the system\r\nbegin to resume their normal physiological functions. Absorption from\r\nthe intestinal surfaces is again restored, and remedies may be\r\nadministered with confidence in their effects.\r\n\r\nThe question is now no longer whether antiperiodics should be\r\nadministered, but how they shall be given. Many practitioners prefer\r\nexhibiting them in one large dose; others think it better to give them\r\nin repeated small doses. I have usually adopted the latter method.\r\nBeginning with the sweating stage, I give three grains of quinia every\r\nhour or two hours, until eighteen grains have been taken. This would\r\noccupy periods of five to ten hours to complete the doses, ordinarily\r\nquite a sufficient length of time to obtain cinchonism before the\r\nadvent of another paroxysm. If the physician elects to give his\r\nantiperiodic in one or two large doses, he should not trust to so\r\nsmall an amount as eighteen grains. Allowance must be made for the\r\nloss incident to the probable over-taxation of the power to dissolve\r\nand receive a large amount into the circulation.\r\n\r\nPurgation should not be induced to a sufficient degree to hurry the\r\nquinia off before absorption takes place. Some practitioners favor the\r\nemployment of adjuvants to the quinia. Very few of these have appeared\r\nto me to be of service except opium. A very convenient formula is a\r\nsolution of quinia in peppermint-water by addition of dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, in such proportions that fl. drachm j of the solution shall\r\nrepresent five grains of quinia and seven and a half drops of\r\nlaudanum.\r\n\r\nBut, however we may boast of the efficacy of cinchona as the anceps\r\nremedium for malarial diseases, we are forced to admit that it is not\r\ncertainly an immediate cure, and very commonly fails in producing a\r\npermanent curative effect. If we could in all cases discern and remove\r\nthe impediments to its immediate or temporarily curative action, its\r\nclaims to be regarded as a practical specific would be undeniable. It\r\nis probable that these impediments generally rest upon the fact that\r\neither the remedy does not gain admission to the circulation or that\r\nsome complication exists not within the range of its therapeutic\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe failure of cinchona to cure a malarial attack in such a permanent\r\nmanner that it shall not be liable to return is probably owing to the\r\nincompetent action of the drug because of its transitory stay in the\r\nsystem as compared with that of the malarial poison. Some objections\r\napply to this theory, because when the succession of intermittent\r\nattacks is broken by quinia and it is continuously administered\r\nafterward, the paroxysms occasionally recur in spite of its presence\r\nin the system. These objections may be answered by pleading that under\r\nthese circumstances secondary blood-poisons precipitate the attacks,\r\nand cinchona should not be expected to cure these conditions.\r\n\r\nThe best methods of practice I know of to prevent a recurrence of\r\n{598} intermittent fever after having interrupted the succession of\r\nattacks are, first, to continue the cinchona for at least forty-eight\r\nhours, giving at least three three-grain doses a day. After this no\r\nmedicine need be given except such as may be required to correct\r\nchronic toxæmic states of the system or to act as blood-restoratives\r\nuntil such time as prodromes of another paroxysm may exhibit\r\nthemselves. At the instant when these manifest themselves ten to\r\nfifteen grains of quinia in solution should be taken. In order that no\r\nloss of time should occur in applying this method, I always advise\r\npatients to keep a solution of quinia within immediate reach. The\r\nfollowing prescription has sometimes appeared to effect a permanent\r\nexemption from recurrence of paroxysms:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Ferri Redacti   gr. xl;\r\n      Acid. Arseniosi gr. j;\r\n      Quiniæ Sulph.   gr. xl;\r\n      Ol. Pip. Nigr.  gtt. x. M.\r\n      Ft. pil. No. xx.\r\n\r\nS. One pill three times daily.\r\n\r\nIt seems sometimes to occur that intermittent attacks so impress the\r\nnervous system that they become, like epilepsy, more liable to recur\r\nbecause of an established habit. I have known chills to occur when the\r\nears were ringing with quinia. Strychnia fails to arrest them; arsenic\r\nhas more value, but frequently fails. Pure nitric acid, properly\r\ndiluted, in doses of six to ten drops, given every four to six hours\r\nwithout regard to the stage of the paroxysm, succeeds more often than\r\nany medication I have ever resorted to.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of the treatment of simple intermittent\r\nfever it may be proper to mention that I have made trials of cure by\r\ncarbolic acid, administered by mouth and subcutaneously, and also of\r\nthe sulphites, with no results worthy of recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemittent Fever.\r\n\r\nThe difference in definition between the words remittent and\r\nintermittent expresses the clinical distinction between these two\r\nforms of fever in a very satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nRemittent fever exhibits oscillations of temperature regulated as to\r\nhours of recurrence by laws similar to those which govern the periodic\r\nreturns of intermittent fever; but there is no complete defervescence\r\nof the fever. While the lowest angles of the fever curve approximate\r\nthe normal body heat more or less closely, they never decline to a\r\nstandard of apyrexia.\r\n\r\nThat remittent fever is a malarial disease, produced by a cause\r\nidentical with that which produces intermittent fever, is well proven\r\nby the following facts:\r\n\r\nFirst. Cases occur in close relation with cases of intermittent fever\r\nin populations similarly exposed to malaria, and at the same periods\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nSecond. The two forms of disease are readily convertible, the one with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn non-tropical countries remittent fever cannot be regarded as the\r\n{599} natural type of malarial fevers. At least, it may be affirmed\r\nthat the proportion of cases which begin as remittent attacks is so\r\nsmall that we are warranted in looking upon them as departures from\r\ntype. In the United States army during the years 1861-66, inclusive,\r\nthere occurred 286,490 cases of remittent fever. The fatal cases were\r\n3853, being a mortality-rate of 13,450 per 1,000,000 cases. By\r\ncomparing these statistics with those of intermittent fever recorded\r\nin a previous section it will be found that remittent fever is more\r\nthan twelve times as fatal to life as the simple intermittent forms.\r\n\r\nIf we accept this view of the pathology of remittent fever, it is of\r\ninterest to the sanitarian or practitioner to endeavor to arrive at\r\nthe causes which occasion these departures from type. Some of these\r\nare undoubtedly extraneous to the system, and relate wholly to\r\ncircumstances affecting the malarial poison as a disease-producing\r\nagent. Increased quantity of malaria is well understood to enlarge the\r\nratio of remittent cases. There is also strong presumptive evidence\r\nsupporting the hypothesis that different annual crops of malaria vary\r\nin respect to the noxious qualities of this agent. The same\r\npresumption relates to all crops produced in certain localities as\r\ncontrasted with others. Other causes which determine remittent rather\r\nthan intermittent attacks are personal to patients. They may be\r\nclassed as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst. Unusual personal receptivity or impressibility to malaria may\r\nexist, either because of some constitutional idiosyncrasy or of some\r\nstate the system at the time of exposure.\r\n\r\nSecond. Want of timely medical treatment or of proper medical\r\ntreatment may convert intermittents into remittents.\r\n\r\nThird. The rapid occurrence of secondary blood infections,\r\nextraordinary in character or amount, may cause the fever to be\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nFourth. The existence of complications, inflammatory in their nature,\r\nmay change intermittent into remittent attacks.\r\n\r\nHowever various or complex the causes may be which operate to convert\r\nintermittent attacks into remittent forms of fever, each one must be\r\nsupposed to act by disturbing the functions of those centres which\r\npreside over the normal physiological and chemical changes of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS.--Attacks of remittent fever are, as a rule,\r\nmore abrupt in their advent than intermittents. When prodromic\r\nsymptoms exist, they are similar to those which precede ordinary cases\r\nof ague.\r\n\r\nThe chill is seldom attended by such violent symptoms as the cold\r\nstage of intermittents. The duration of the cold stage is also more\r\nbrief. In a small proportion of cases severe vomiting with large\r\nbilious ejections complicate the cold stage. The chill is quickly\r\nfollowed by the hot stage.\r\n\r\nThe mildest cases of remittent fever are not readily distinguishable\r\nfrom the intermittent forms. In these cases the temperature curves are\r\nmarked by sharp angles and long tracings between the lowest and\r\nhighest records. As cases become more decided in diagnosis, and\r\nconsequently represent higher degrees of departure from the\r\nintermittent type, the angles of temperature curves become more obtuse\r\nand exhibit a more or less high average range. The accompanying\r\ntemperature diagram (Fig. 23) shows the thermometric record of an\r\nunusually protracted and grave case. The patient was a near relative\r\nof my colleague, Prof. Logan, a leading practitioner of New Orleans,\r\nand the clinical records may be {601} accepted as altogether accurate.\r\nIt is somewhat to be regretted that the records of temperature were\r\nnot begun at an earlier period, but the gravity of the case was not\r\nmanifest until the continued type of fever was found to exist. The\r\nlatter part of the diagram illustrates the lapse of the remittent\r\nfever into an intermittent. This is so commonly a mode of cure that\r\nthe practitioner watches with solicitude for increasing oscillations\r\nof temperature to announce mitigations of severity in his gravest\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n{600} [Illustration: FIG. 23. Temperature chart showing the lapse of a\r\nremittent fever into an intermittent. NOTE.--From the third to the\r\nfifteenth day after attack a half drachm of quinia was given daily.\r\nObserving no good result, it was omitted until the twenty-ninth day,\r\non which date two doses of eight grains each were administered. On the\r\nmorning of the thirty-fourth day eight grains were again given; on the\r\nthirty-fifth day one scruple was given.]\r\n\r\nThe differential diagnosis of intermittent and remittent fevers may be\r\nlooked upon as practically unimportant. All cases so near the\r\nborderline as to make differential diagnosis a question should receive\r\nidentical treatment.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two other very grave forms of fever which are\r\nliable to give trouble in differentiation from remittent fever. These\r\nare typhoid and yellow fevers. The sanitary protection of communities\r\nexposed to cases of the latter, and also the practical treatment of\r\nthe sick, call for early and correct differentiation.\r\n\r\nBut it is only in the early stages of the pathological processes of\r\nthese affections that difficulties of diagnosis are liable to obtain.\r\nThe facial expression of patients suffering with remittent is\r\nsufficiently characteristic to afford some diagnostic inferences.\r\nDuring the pyrexia the face is flushed and the eyes injected, but the\r\nredness is more vivid and the countenance more animated than in either\r\ntyphoid or yellow fever. It would not be inaccurate to say that,\r\nhowever great may be the flushing or other alterations of the\r\ncountenance in remittent fever, the natural facial expression is\r\nbetter preserved than in either of the fevers under comparison with\r\nit. Sallowness of the skin is an early and almost constant event in\r\nremittent fever. It comes on as a secondary manifestation, and appears\r\nin a large ratio of cases to bear some relation to the high\r\ntemperature preceding its occurrence. The icteric hue is seldom\r\nintense, indeed very infrequently equalling the orange-yellow of\r\njaundice resulting from obstruction. There is an exception to this\r\nstatement in those cases in which remittent fever attacks a person\r\nalready jaundiced. I have seen many cases in which the jaundice\r\npreceded the remittent fever, and became more strongly marked after\r\nits incursion, particularly in those persons who had remained for some\r\ntime in a malarial region and suffered repeated attacks. In all cases\r\nof remittent fever it seems reasonable to ascribe the more or less\r\njaundiced state to one or both of two factors, viz.--the accumulation\r\nof excrementitious material and bile constituents in the blood from\r\nprimary derangement of its chemistry; and that excessive activity of\r\nthe liver which the malarial poison appears to induce. Whether the\r\nlatter mentioned factor results from some action of malaria directly\r\naffecting the nutritive processes of the liver, as it does those of\r\nthe spleen, or whether the altered blood-currents during the paroxysms\r\ncause this supposed hypersecretion of bile, we certainly know that to\r\nmalaria only can we ascribe those fevers which are marked by such\r\npeculiar symptoms of biliousness or superabundance of bile as to\r\njustify the prefix bilious fever or bilious remittent fever.\r\n\r\nThe state of the alimentary tract may properly receive notice after\r\nthese remarks. In the early stages of remittent fever the tongue may\r\nbe moist and large, and covered with a white or lead-colored or\r\nyellowish coat. The edges may be indented with imprints of the teeth.\r\nThis is {602} Osborne's malarial tongue, and its appearance is worth\r\nsomething in diagnosis.\r\n\r\nLater in the progress of remittent fever the tongue may become dry,\r\nbrown, cracked, and difficult of protrusion, but seldom showing the\r\ntremulousness of a typhoid-fever tongue, and differing also from the\r\nyellow-fever tongue in the fact that in this disease the appearance of\r\nthe tongue is usually indifferent as a symptom, except that in\r\nadvanced stages it is liable to be smeared with blood.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is irritable from the very beginning of an attack, and the\r\nacts of emesis are generally in striking contrast with those of\r\ntyphoid or yellow fever, both in respect to their violence and to the\r\nrelative amount of bile they eject.\r\n\r\nThe bowels are ordinarily costive, and when moved by purgatives the\r\nstools contrast strongly with those of typhoid or yellow fever by\r\npresenting evidences of the bile-coloring principles which attend all\r\nexcretions in malarial fever, and are found in the urine, the\r\nperspiration, and occasionally the sputa.\r\n\r\nSome unusually violent cases of malarial fever, which may become\r\nremittent, are inaugurated with convulsions, profuse diarrhoea, and\r\ncoma.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the remarks concerning the digestive organs in\r\nremittent fever I should mention that in the long array of cases I\r\nhave treated I cannot recall one solitary instance of black vomit. It\r\nis, however, true that I have observed hemorrhage from the bowels in\r\nquite a number of cases. These occurred late in protracted cases, and\r\nwere sometimes the cause of death. Whether it be merely a coincidence\r\nI am unable to say, but it is true that the majority of these cases\r\nhave been in young females just after the establishment of the\r\ncatamenia.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage from the nose is frequent in remittent fever, but I have\r\nnever seen a case with general tendency to hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe pulse in remittent fever differs from that of the typhoid or\r\nyellow fevers by being more synochal in character, firmer, and more\r\nresisting to pressure. The longer the duration of the case the less is\r\nthis characteristic discernible.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system shows less ataxia. Delirium may occur in any stage\r\nof the disease, but differs from the delirium of typhoid and yellow\r\nfevers in showing a lessened degree of perversion of the reasoning\r\nfaculties. The neuralgias have nothing special.\r\n\r\nThe urine is acid, high-colored, and scanty. I have never found much\r\nalbumen in the urine of a case of remittent fever, unless there was\r\nsome other cause to account for its presence. A small amount may be\r\ndetected during excessive fever. Blood is a rare constituent.\r\n\r\nMild cases of remittent fever should terminate in recovery in from\r\nfive to seven days. Fatal attacks usually end from the fifth to the\r\ntenth day. Many cases pursue a course which lasts from twenty to forty\r\ndays. Under proper treatment the usual termination is in recovery,\r\neither directly or by conversion into the intermittent type.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.--When death occurs in remittent fever the\r\npost-mortem changes generally consist of those which are principally\r\ndue to chronic malarial toxæmia and those ascribable to the acute\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nUnder the former division are permanent enlargements of the spleen and\r\nliver, and pigmentary matter in the blood and deposited in various\r\n{603} organs. Under the latter are to be classed hyperæmic or even\r\ninflammatory states of the stomach and intestines, and those\r\ndegenerative changes which are the consequence of continuous\r\nhyperpyrexia. The post-mortem changes which are so uniformly found as\r\nto be most often appealed to in the establishment of diagnoses are\r\nenlargements of the liver and spleen. These may be due in part to\r\nhyperplasia and in part to blood-engorgement. The brown or slate color\r\nof an enlarged liver is strongly diagnostic of malarial affections. It\r\ncontrasts strongly with the yellow and natural-sized liver of yellow\r\nfever and with the negative liver of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThe skin is generally yellow, sometimes quite intensely icteric, but\r\nseldom showing the ecchymotic extravasations of yellow fever. In\r\nremittent fever we never find the cadaver oozing blood from the nose\r\nand the mouth, nor are the stomach or intestines ever found to contain\r\nblack vomit.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--The indications of treatment in remittent fevers differ\r\nfrom those of intermittents in two leading essentials.\r\n\r\nFirst. It is a far graver form of fever, and calls for more\r\npromptitude and energy in treatment for its successful management.\r\n\r\nSecond. The important pathological condition to be combated is the\r\nhyperpyrexia, and not the cold stage, as in intermittents.\r\n\r\nBut even with a clear realization of the practical importance of these\r\nfacts in governing the treatment of remittents, the practitioner must\r\nstill exercise care and self-control, lest he shall unconsciously\r\nadopt the doctrine that inflammatory lesions must be present to\r\noccasion such violent pyrexia as often exists. The physician who comes\r\ndirectly from a case of pneumonia or rheumatic fever and finds a\r\npatient suffering from remittent fever, with temperature higher and\r\npulse more bounding than those of the patient he has just left, is\r\npardonable for finding it difficult to realize that these furious\r\nsymptoms are not also associated with inflammation.\r\n\r\nAttempts to cure remittent fevers by an exclusively antiphlogistic\r\ntreatment either result fatally or induce long periods of confinement\r\nand suffering before recovery is reached. The great indication is to\r\nsecure cinchonism as promptly and completely as possible. Nothing\r\nshould divert our attention from this object. The condition of the\r\npatient as it respects fever, delirium, or state of the tongue, should\r\nform no bar to the administration of quinia. There are no\r\npractitioners who have had much experience in treating these grave\r\nforms of malarial fever after this method who are not able to recall\r\nthe numerous instances of most astonishing and gratifying amelioration\r\nof symptoms as soon as saturation with quinia was brought about. The\r\ndry tongue becomes moist, the skin is bathed in gentle perspiration,\r\nthe delirium ceases, and the patient sinks into a quiet sleep.\r\n\r\nThe amount of quinia necessary to produce cinchonism must be estimated\r\nfor each particular case according to the measure of its severity or\r\nto states of the system more or less favorable to its absorption. It\r\nmust be borne in mind, however, that questions concerning the\r\npatient's safety are paramount to those of economy. In the mildest\r\ncases I never trust to a smaller amount than from twenty to thirty\r\ngrains. In violent attacks I have administered scruple doses every\r\nfourth hour until a {604} sufficient test had been made of its\r\ncapability to arrest or modify the febrile paroxysm. I have never met\r\nwith any of those exaggerated physiological effects which some\r\nobservers teach us to fear from the exhibition of cinchona\r\npreparations during fever. Certainly, I can declare that no permanent\r\ndeafness or other lasting lesion of nerve-function has ever occurred\r\nunder my observation. I must also add that I know of no reasons why\r\nremissions afford more favorable conditions for the administration of\r\nquinia, beyond the fact that the system is in a better state for its\r\nabsorption and assimilation. The quinia is preferably given in\r\nsolution, but may be exhibited in the form of pills, or in powder\r\nsuspended in black coffee, or in the thick mucilage of the slippery\r\nelm.\r\n\r\nThe considerations of treatment which are naturally connected with\r\nthose just advocated relate to measures which it may be proper to\r\nassociate with the quinia. The answers to the two following questions\r\ncomprise all that is necessary to be said on this point--viz.:\r\n\r\nAre conditions of the system present which may interfere with the\r\nspecific treatment by quinia, and which are not, in themselves,\r\ncurable by it?\r\n\r\nAre any medicines to be given as succedanea to the specific remedy for\r\nthe purpose of rendering its action more sure or prompt?\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first inquiry, it must be admitted that in quite a\r\nlarge proportion of cases of remittent fever specific treatment fails\r\nto cure. I suppose that may be a reasonable proposition which holds\r\nthat in the majority of these cases the presence of secondary\r\nblood-impurities annuls the ordinary specific effects of cinchona.\r\nThese must be gotten rid of by depurative medicines. The intestinal\r\ncanal, the skin, and the kidneys are the emunctories through which\r\nelimination must be effected. It is therefore proper for the physician\r\nto endeavor to recognize cases where such impurities exist, and to so\r\nmodify his treatment as to remove them. The indications for depurative\r\ntreatment are jaundiced skin and eyes, furred tongue, costive bowels,\r\nand scanty, loaded urine. These are more or less positively expressed\r\nsymptoms in a large majority of cases. It is therefore proper that in\r\nthis large majority of cases of remittent fever depurative treatment\r\nshould be conjoined with the specific treatment. In my opinion, no\r\ndrugs meet this indication so well as mercurials and saline purges and\r\ndiuretics. Calomel or blue mass may be given either simultaneously\r\nwith the quinia or in alternate doses.\r\n\r\nThere are three very important rules to be observed in regard to\r\ncathartics: They should never be carried to such an extent that\r\nabsorption of the quinine is interrupted. They should not be given in\r\nsuch large or repeated doses as to produce prolonged irritation, or it\r\nmay be even inflammation, of the alimentary canal. Purgatives should\r\nbe used for their depurative effects, and never as antiphologistics.\r\n\r\nOpium exercises excellent effects in preventing local irritation or\r\nhypercatharsis, and in relieving derangements of nerve-function and\r\ninsomnia. It is preferably given in small doses, combined either with\r\npurgatives or with the quinia.\r\n\r\nI have found bitartrate of potassium the most grateful and efficient\r\nsaline for depurative action. I have generally given it in lemonade in\r\nsuch amounts as to secure a gentle aperient and diuretic effect. I\r\nhold strongly to a conviction that all drugs as soluble as this\r\nfacilitate the absorption of those less soluble--as, for example, of\r\nquinia.\r\n\r\n{605} If the first efforts to break the febrile paroxysms fail, it is\r\nbetter to discontinue the quinia and place the patient under\r\nsymptomatic treatment, and await conditions of the system more\r\nfavorable for its repetition. Of course the high temperature is\r\ngenerally the symptom requiring most care and attention.\r\n\r\nVomiting is one of the troublesome symptoms of remittent fever. As\r\ninternal medication minute doses of morphia, dry upon the tongue or in\r\nsolution in cherry-laurel water, or in combination with eight or ten\r\ndrops of chloroform, are generally efficacious. Swallowing pellets of\r\nice or frequently taking iced effervescing mixtures are good measures\r\nof treatment. Occasionally, a mild emetic, such as warm chamomile\r\ninfusion, or warm water alone, will arrest the vomiting temporarily.\r\nIt is doubtful, however, whether this relief is secured by the\r\nejection of any offending matter from the stomach. It is more than\r\nprobable that the forced dilatation of the stomach has arrested the\r\nspasms, for filling this viscus with cold drinks to repletion will\r\noften effect the same result.\r\n\r\nOf all applications to the epigastrium, a cold wet towel occasionally\r\nsprinkled with chloroform is the best.\r\n\r\nA tympanitic or tender abdomen requires stupes wrung from warm water.\r\nThey may be dashed with turpentine at first, and afterward consist of\r\nwarm water with whiskey. I have occasionally given two or three doses\r\nof turpentine emulsion with benefit, but from much observation I am\r\nforced to protest against the turpentine treatment, as it is called,\r\nwhich is to give twenty drops of turpentine every two to four hours as\r\na curative agent.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage from the bowels must be met by hæmostatic\r\ntreatment--preferably, in my experience, by the use of five grains of\r\ngallic acid in half an ounce of camphor-water every two hours, of\r\nmorphia subcutaneously, and of cold cloths over the bowels. As in all\r\ndiseases liable to cause death from exhaustion, careful attention must\r\nbe paid to the nutriment, and stimulants must be administered as\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\nPernicious Malarial Fever.\r\n\r\nCertain departures from the ordinary types of malarial fever are\r\ntermed pernicious, because of their great tendency to inflict more\r\nthan usual systemic damage and danger to life upon those who suffer\r\nsuch attacks. The word pernicious is used in its common English sense\r\nof being hurtful or injurious.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely unnecessary to enter upon a discussion respecting the\r\npropriety of employing this adjective to designate a class of cases of\r\ndisease which are primarily due to the same poison which produces\r\nsimple intermittent attacks. The extreme hurtfulness and danger of the\r\nattacks to be described in this section, and the awful suddenness with\r\nwhich they often occasion death, form striking contrasts with the more\r\ntypical forms of malarial fever, and appear fully to justify the use\r\nof the qualifying adjective pernicious.\r\n\r\nWhile all these various departures from type to be grouped under the\r\nterm pernicious possess the quality ascribed to them, they\r\nnevertheless differ so widely in their modes of inflicting injury that\r\nit seems desirable to arrange them under distinct sub-classifications.\r\n\r\n{606} Some cases of pernicious malarial fever preserve the periodicity\r\nof simple attacks sufficiently well to enable one to classify them as\r\nintermittent or remittent in form. But more commonly it is impossible\r\nto determine this classification, and for practical purposes it is\r\nunimportant to attempt to make any such distinction.\r\n\r\nThe classification which appears to me most true to nature is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  First. The algid or congestive form;\r\n  Second. The comatose form;\r\n  Third. The hemorrhagic form.\r\n\r\nThe algid or congestive form occurs more frequently than either of the\r\nothers. Its perniciousness is due to an aggravation or sheer\r\nexaggeration of the cold stage of an intermittent attack.\r\n\r\nThe following brief clinical histories of two cases will serve to\r\nillustrate the symptomatic phenomena of this form of pernicious\r\nmalarial fever:\r\n\r\nM. S., aged fourteen, had accompanied his father to a malarious\r\nlocality in the country, and had remained with him during September\r\nand a portion of October. Shortly after his return I was asked to\r\nvisit him because of some unusual symptoms attending a chill. I found\r\nhim in a stupor, from which he was with difficulty aroused\r\nsufficiently to be able to swallow a dose of quinia combined with\r\nlaudanum. His face was pallid and inexpressive; the skin cool and\r\nmoist; extremities shrunken and cold; pulse small, easily obliterated\r\nby pressure, and irregular; tongue large and moist; and pupils rather\r\ndilated.\r\n\r\nMy second visit was at 12 M., one hour and a half later than the\r\nfirst. Patient was found in a deep stupor; surface cold; extremities\r\nand face shrunken and blue; pulse barely perceptible; large liquid and\r\noffensive stools occasionally escaped from the bowels without the\r\nconsciousness of the patient. Death at 3 o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nMiss H., living in a malarious situation, complained about noon of\r\nSeptember 19th of great cerebral fulness and unaccountable sleepiness\r\nand debility. She retired to her room, and after a few hours' sleep\r\nresumed her household occupations. On the 20th similar symptoms\r\nmanifested themselves, but earlier in the day. She again slept for\r\nsome hours, but complained of great prostration after the sleep. On\r\nthe 21st, about 10 A.M., she complained of a return of the stupor, and\r\nwhile retiring to her room requested that I should be called if she\r\ndid not awake in a better condition. At 1 P.M. she was found\r\nprofoundly comatose, with cold extremities and surface and bathed in\r\nperspiration. When I reached her residence at 3 P.M. she had expired.\r\n\r\nThere is a common belief among non-professional people that the third\r\ncongestive chill is necessarily fatal. There is no foundation for this\r\nopinion, except in the fact that when congestive chills are waxing in\r\ntheir perniciousness the subject is seldom able to survive the third\r\nrecurrence if the second or first should not prove fatal.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for the pathological dissimilarity between\r\nthe simple and congestive types of malarial fevers. If we say that\r\ncongestive chills are produced by an intensification of those causes\r\nwhich produce and govern an ordinary chill, we make an explanation\r\nwhich, however unsatisfactory, represents very nearly the full extent\r\nof our knowledge on this point.\r\n\r\n{607} It cannot be admitted that alterations of quantity or quality of\r\nthe malarial poison exercise the sole influence in determining the\r\noccurrence of congestive cases. All experienced practitioners\r\nunderstand that certain constitutional conditions may pervert simple\r\nchills into congestive forms by producing prolongation or aggravation\r\nof the states of congestion always present in ordinary chills.\r\nWeakened cardiac function, from whatever cause, may be reckoned among\r\nthese conditions. In these cases the feeble vis a tergo yields readily\r\nto those perturbations of vaso-motor influence which occasion passive\r\nblood-accumulations in the small veins and capillaries. I may say\r\nfurther, in speaking of the influence of the vaso-motor nerves in\r\ngoverning the phenomena of a chill, that we know that in congestive\r\nchills the cerebro-spinal system is much less the seat of symptomatic\r\nphenomena than in simple attacks. On the other hand, the organic\r\nsystem is far more profoundly affected.\r\n\r\nHowever we may account for the perversions of normal circulation\r\nunderlying and producing congestive chills, the great degree of injury\r\nthey are liable to inflict is so well understood as to awaken the most\r\nserious apprehensions whenever we are called upon to treat them.\r\nCongestion, however occasioned, may destroy life through abolishment\r\nof function by the sheer physical change of infarction, or, again,\r\nthrough those inevitable consequences which arrested circulation\r\nentails upon the blood. Blood-stasis is followed by separation of its\r\nconstituents, and its disqualification as a circulatory fluid in a\r\ndegree proportionate to the duration of the stoppage, and probably\r\nalso to the actual extent of the passive engorgement. Thence result\r\nthe formation of coagula in the congested vessels and deposits of\r\npigmentary matter. If partial reaction should occur, portions of this\r\nblood-débris may be floated to various parts of the circulatory\r\nsystem, and give rise to greater or less important alterations of\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nAmong the white soldiers of the United States army from May 1, 1861,\r\nto June 20, 1866, 13,673 cases were diagnosed as congestive\r\nintermittent fever. Of this number, 3370 died, being a mortality-rate\r\nof 23.91 per cent. The aggregate number of malarial cases returned was\r\n1,255,623. It would therefore appear that 1 case in not quite 372 was\r\ncongestive in its type, or 1.08 per cent. The late Dr. Cook of\r\nWashington, La., estimated 2 per cent. of his malarial cases to be of\r\nthe congestive type. It can scarcely be doubted that the ratio of\r\ncongestive attacks is greater in the more southern belts of latitude\r\nthan in the middle or northern parts of the United States. Chronic\r\nmalarial toxæmia and the enervating effects of long-continued heat\r\nupon the circulation must occasion an increased proportion of such\r\nattacks, but my own observations show slightly more than 1 per cent.\r\nof the cases treated in the Charity Hospital to have been of the\r\ncongestive form.\r\n\r\nThe cure of a congestive chill is one of the most difficult problems\r\nthe physician can possibly encounter. It is nothing less than the\r\nproposition to remove a perverted state of the blood-vessels which is\r\ndependent upon some influence exerted through a nervous apparatus\r\nwhose therapeutics and experimental physiology are imperfectly\r\nunderstood. While a satisfactory solution of this problem will\r\nprobably be a remote achievement in medicine, it was long ago\r\nempirically ascertained that certain {608} agents exercised some\r\ndegree of control over the cold stage of febrile attacks. For the most\r\npart, these agents are addressed to those perversions of\r\nnerve-function which constitute so important a part of the pathology\r\nof a chill. They are identically the same remedies whose aid we invoke\r\nto allay many other forms of perturbed nervous action. Opium,\r\nchloroform, belladonna, chloral hydrate, and bromide of potassium have\r\nproved more or less valuable, according to the idiosyncrasy of the\r\npatient or the circumstances under which they have been used. I\r\nconsider opium the most valuable of these remedies. It should be given\r\nin moderate doses, and preferably combined with chloroform or ammonia,\r\nor, if more expedient to administer per rectum, combined with\r\nsolutions of chloral hydrate or bromide of potassium. One-sixth of a\r\ngrain of morphia, combined with one-fortieth or one-fiftieth of a\r\ngrain of atropia, is an available and useful prescription when given\r\nhypodermically. Rubbing the extremities or the spine, or indeed the\r\nwhole surface, with ice, is a mode of practice well worthy of\r\nattention. In the event of inability to procure ice, douches of cold\r\nwater, followed by frictions with coarse towels, may be substituted. I\r\nhave used nitrite of amyl by inhalation, but its effects are too\r\ntransitory to prove serviceable.\r\n\r\nSome practitioners speak highly of alcoholic stimulants. My own\r\nexperience has not been favorable to their use. Perhaps their benefits\r\nare altogether restricted to those cases in which previously weakened\r\nheart-function existed. But it is important that alcohol be added in\r\nall those cases of pernicious malarial fever, whatever the type may\r\nbe, where cardiac stimulation and improvement of nutrition are leading\r\nindications.\r\n\r\nI am sure I have often derived benefit from enemas consisting of four\r\nounces of well-prepared beef essence with a half ounce of whiskey or\r\nbrandy and a half ounce of strong infusion of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe value of the hypodermic syringe in treating congestive chills must\r\nnever be lost sight of. The suspension, or even reversal, of normal\r\nsystemic currents is made evident by the serous vomiting and purging\r\nattending congestion of the abdominal cavity. Medicine placed in the\r\nstomach under these circumstances is virtually thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe term comatose is applied to certain cases of pernicious malarial\r\nfever because they present coma as a marked symptom. To appreciate the\r\npropriety of this classification, it must be well understood that the\r\ncoma present is not due to cerebral congestion. Further than this one\r\nrestriction upon the application of the word there is in its\r\nemployment no declaration of any pathological views respecting the\r\ncases it is intended to define. While, therefore, the term is\r\nunquestionably liable to criticism, I suppose its use may still be\r\nadmitted, provided it is accompanied by a satisfactorily explicit\r\naccount of the symptoms and probable pathological conditions of the\r\ncases included under its caption.\r\n\r\nThere is a sharp line of distinction between the symptoms and\r\nconjectural pathology of comatose cases and of those of the congestive\r\nform of pernicious fever. The following notes of cases will\r\nsufficiently establish this statement:\r\n\r\nC. L., fisherman, aged forty-four, brought into Ward 20, Charity\r\nHospital, in an insensible condition, November 18, 1875. Temperature\r\nat time of admission 104.8°, pulse 120, respiration 40; able to\r\nswallow liquids placed far back in his mouth. Ordered scruple ij of\r\nquinia in {609} solution, ten grains to be given every fourth hour.\r\nNov. 19th, patient has taken and retained all the quinia ordered; is\r\nperspiring profusely; temperature 97.8°, pulse 88; more conscious;\r\ntakes food and water when offered him. Ordered blue mass, comp. extr.\r\ncolocynth., _aa_ gr. v, to be taken at once. To drink through the day\r\nbitartrate potass. oz. j, dissolved in lemonade, until bowels are\r\nmoved. Evening temperature 99.3°. Nov. 20th, temperature 98°; patient\r\nplaced under convalescent treatment; discharged from hospital Nov.\r\n29th.\r\n\r\nAnother comatose patient was admitted to Ward 19 on the 29th of\r\nOctober, entirely insensible. He was treated by large doses of quinia\r\nin solution per rectum, and by calomel gr. xx, sodii bicarb. gr. v,\r\nplaced upon base of tongue, and caused to be swallowed by a\r\ntablespoonful of water trickled over the powder. As the patient began\r\nto recover it was noticed that his right arm was paralyzed. A history\r\nsubsequently obtained showed that the patient was an engineer, and had\r\nbeen engaged in making some land surveys in a swampy portion of the\r\nState of Louisiana, and had been often obliged to wade or swim across\r\nthe bayous and to sleep at night in the open air, sometimes without\r\nany protection from the weather. He had previously enjoyed good\r\nhealth, and was altogether unable to account for the paralysis of his\r\narm. During convalescence he was treated with iron, strychnia, and\r\npreparations of cinchona, and by cold douches and frictions to the\r\nparalyzed arm. Convalescence was slow, but he was discharged,\r\ncompletely recovered, on November 20th.\r\n\r\nIn typical cases the differential diagnosis between the congestive\r\nform and the comatose is made without difficulty. In a congestive\r\nchill the surface is cold, blue, or livid, the pupils dilated, and the\r\npulse generally slower than natural and irregular. In the comatose\r\nform the surface is preternaturally warm, of a muddy, semi-jaundiced\r\nhue, and the pulse and temperature both indicate the feverish rather\r\nthan the algid state.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of attacks of the comatose form of malarial fever are for\r\nthe most part persons who, having contracted attacks of fever in\r\nmalarial regions, continue to reside in the same localities and yet\r\nuse no proper medication, either for cure or for prophylaxis. We have\r\nin these cases accumulations of secondary blood-poisons quite\r\nsufficient to greatly impede brain-function, and the additional doses\r\nof the primary toxic agent must exercise more or less influence in\r\ndetermining the phenomena of the attacks.\r\n\r\nVery little need be said of treatment, beyond a recommendation of the\r\ncourses pursued in the cases cited. Hypodermic medication must be\r\nresorted to when necessary. Efforts to nourish the patient must never\r\nbe relaxed. One must see many of these cases before he can realize how\r\noften they recover, from conditions apparently utterly hopeless, when\r\npromptly treated and properly nourished.\r\n\r\nThe hemorrhagic form of pernicious malarial fever can scarcely be\r\nregarded as an original type. Malaria is not a hemorrhage-inducing\r\npoison. Indeed, it may be positively stated that malaria never\r\nestablishes the hemorrhagic diathesis as a primary effect; and it is\r\nonly by changes effected in the human economy by its prolonged\r\ninfluence that it appears to become capable of doing so. The most\r\nexperienced and accurate observers of malarial affections concur in\r\nthe opinion that this rule is almost without exception.\r\n\r\n{610} The morbid conditions whose concurrence entails upon malarial\r\nfevers a tendency to hemorrhages may be classed together as follows:\r\nFirst. The blood-changes of chronic malarial toxæmia so alter the\r\nconsistency of that fluid as to favor the occurrence of hemorrhage.\r\nSecond. The long persistent states of malnutrition in chronic malarial\r\ncachexias produce textural weakening of the vascular walls and\r\nincreased liability to their rupture. Third. There should be added to\r\nthese one other factor, which is mainly operative during a malarial\r\nparoxysm--namely, the increased blood-pressure put upon the vascular\r\nwalls by passive congestions.\r\n\r\nTwo of these factors, as above enumerated, are more or less general to\r\nthe system, being the consequence of general cachectic states. The\r\nthird factor acts in a purely dynamical manner in causing hemorrhages,\r\nand must necessarily have its area of influence confined to some\r\ncertain portion or portions of the vascular tree, since the\r\ncongestions of malarial paroxysms cannot by any possibility be\r\ngeneral. It is an interesting fact that the influence of this\r\nlast-mentioned factor is so frequently paramount in producing malarial\r\nhemorrhages. These hemorrhages occur in such immediate relation to\r\nchills that we are forced to the conclusion that while altered blood\r\nand weakened blood-vessels were previously present, yet some increase\r\nof pressure beyond the normal was required to precipitate the\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nMore than once in the presence of medical classes I have illustrated\r\nthe influence of these various factors, respectively, by showing the\r\narm of a patient suffering with chronic malarial cachexia, with no\r\nextravasation of blood, but upon which the slightest suction with the\r\nlips would produce exaggerated ecchymoses. This explains the fact that\r\nhemorrhages in malarial fevers are never general, but only manifest\r\nthemselves upon those surfaces or into those structures which are the\r\nseats of congestion during the cold stage of an intermittent.\r\n\r\nI do most earnestly assert that during a practice of almost half a\r\ncentury, nearly all of which has been passed in malarious localities,\r\nI have never once seen a malarial-fever patient with a general\r\nhemorrhagic tendency, if yellow fever and other hemorrhage-inducing\r\ndiseases could be authoritatively excluded. The medical profession\r\ncannot be too watchful in guarding itself against erroneous entries\r\nupon mortuary records to account for deaths from fevers accompanied by\r\nhemorrhages from multiple surfaces of the body. Such aliases as\r\nhemorrhagic malarial fever, climatic fever, rice fever, hæmatemesic\r\npaludal fever, and many more of the same character, should receive the\r\nseverest examination before approval and adoption.\r\n\r\nWhen hemorrhage does attend malarial fevers, it may occur from one or\r\nanother of a variety of surfaces or into shut cavities or in\r\nparenchymatous structures. Some years ago I visited a gentleman who\r\nwas suffering from an attack of malarial fever, with hæmaturia. He\r\nmade a rapid and, apparently, a complete recovery. Disobeying my\r\ninjunctions, he returned to the intensely malarious locality where he\r\nhad formerly resided. After a few weeks he was seized with a chill,\r\nfollowed by apoplectic symptoms, hemorrhage, and death on third day.\r\nIt is hardly to be doubted that his death was caused by cerebral\r\nhemorrhage. But, however much in consonance with ascertained facts the\r\nforegoing remarks may appear to be, there are certain points of\r\npathology connected with {611} malarial hemorrhagic fevers not easy of\r\nexplanation. Within the last score of years hæmaturia has been a far\r\nmore common form of hemorrhage in malarial fevers than formerly. In\r\nmany localities and during certain seasons it has been very prevalent.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge it is not at all possible to\r\nexplain why it is that different epidemics of malarial diseases should\r\ngive rise to such a diversity of phenomena, so that one epidemic will\r\nbe characterized by a peculiar train of symptoms which shall be absent\r\nin another, being there replaced by different symptoms equally\r\ndistinctive of the second epidemic. Whatever may be the cause of these\r\nepidemical peculiarities, it must rest in a something which is capable\r\nof acting as a force upon the human system. We must think of that\r\nunknown agency which exercises this force and gives it some peculiar\r\ndirection as possessing at least a conventional essentiality. It is\r\nnot satisfactory to say that the renal blood-vessels are the first to\r\ngive way, because they are accidentally more weakened than other parts\r\nof the vascular system, or accidentally more often the seat of\r\ncongestion. When accidents become as numerous as these cases sometimes\r\nare, they acquire the authority of laws.\r\n\r\nThe following notes of two cases of malarial hemorrhagic fever may be\r\nfound of interest:\r\n\r\nC. E., aged twenty-six years, was admitted to Ward 19, Charity\r\nHospital, Nov. 18, 1872. Had been in America more than a year, and for\r\nseveral months had been working in an intensely malarial district\r\npreparing the bed of a railroad; has had malarial diseases for several\r\nmonths, and suffered a severe chill the day before admission. A few\r\nhours after admission temp. 103°, pulse 120, respiration 29; effusion\r\nin both thoracic cavities, and very marked in abdominal cavity; lower\r\nlobe of right lung oedematous, legs anasarcous, pitting greatly on\r\npressure, with several ulcers of long standing. Urine loaded with\r\nalbumen and showing under the microscope abundant blood-corpuscles;\r\nconsiderable jaundice present, which the patient states to have\r\noccurred suddenly. Ordered five grains each of calomel and bicarbonate\r\nof sodium, to be followed after catharsis with ten grains of quinia in\r\nsolution every two hours. Nov. 22d, patient has taken and retained one\r\nhundred and eight grains of quinia; secretion of urine abundant; no\r\nblood present, and only a trace of albumen; ordered twenty drops of\r\ntincture of chloride of iron three times daily. Discharged cured\r\nDecember 12th. The above comprises the whole treatment in this case,\r\nexcept one important measure, which consisted in determined and\r\npersistent efforts at forced nutrition. Meat essences, milk, eggs, and\r\nmilk-punch were given as methodically as drugs.\r\n\r\nH. K., fifteen years of age, was admitted to Charity Hospital Sept.\r\n15, 1872; has a history of malarial poisoning for several months; was\r\nconsiderably jaundiced at time of admission, with anasarcous legs.\r\nUnder the administration of a mercurial, followed by quinia and iron,\r\nhe improved so greatly that he was discharged from my wards and placed\r\nupon some duty in the hospital. Dec. 19th, at 11 A.M., had a chill\r\nwhich lasted several hours; this was followed by violent fever, with\r\nrapid but compressible pulse; much jactitation; incessant vomiting of\r\na greenish-black fluid; urine loaded with blood; and sudden\r\nsupervention of intense jaundice. Ordered quinia gr. xij by hypodermic\r\ninjection; {612} small doses of calomel and soda to be placed upon the\r\nbase of the tongue and washed down with ice-water. Secretion of urine\r\nceased on the morning of the 20th, followed by death at 11 P.M.\r\nAutopsy showed both kidneys dark-colored and swollen from complete\r\nblood-engorgement.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of hemorrhagic malarial fevers may be included under the\r\nfollowing indications:\r\n\r\nFirst, to secure cinchonism as early as possible;\r\n\r\nSecond, to arrest the extravasation of blood;\r\n\r\nThird, to sustain the patient's strength, and to preserve the systemic\r\nfluids at as near a healthy standard as may be possible.\r\n\r\nThe first-mentioned indication is certainly the first in importance.\r\nIf the hemorrhage originates during a chill, or exhibits degrees of\r\naggravation in such close relation to the cold stage of malarial\r\nparoxysms as to point to a relation of cause and effect, then that\r\ncourse of treatment which breaks the recurrence of paroxysms will at\r\nthe same time mitigate the hemorrhage, if, in truth, it should fail to\r\nstop it entirely. Quinia should be given in large doses by the mouth\r\nor rectum, or both, or subcutaneously if demanded by the urgency of\r\nthe symptoms. I have generally used carefully prepared solutions of\r\nthe sulphate for hypodermic injections, but many practitioners prefer\r\nsolutions of the hydrobromate for this mode of exhibition. I have\r\nnever witnessed any symptoms following the administration of cinchona\r\nsalts which justified a belief that they increased the hemorrhage. My\r\nrule of practice has invariably been to endeavor to prevent the\r\noccurrence of another paroxysm, without regard to this very\r\nquestionable charge.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the second indication, it may be stated that patients are\r\nnot likely to die from actual loss of blood in any form of hemorrhagic\r\nmalarial fever. The blood which is poured out on free surfaces and\r\nescapes by some outlet is seldom so much as to endanger life, but the\r\nhemorrhagic process is likely to involve deeper-seated vessels. This\r\nis especially true in malarial hæmaturia. Hemorrhages into the stroma\r\nof the kidneys, the Malpighian tufts, and the uriniferous tubules\r\narrest urinary secretion, and thus entail death. In order to prevent\r\nthese results hæmostatics should be resorted to as often as attendant\r\ncircumstances will permit. Generally these are such as to admit of the\r\nuse of hæmostatics without prejudicing the effects of other remedies.\r\nIn my experience ergot in combination with gallic acid and dilute\r\nsulphuric acid has been very efficient. The following prescription has\r\nbeen usually given:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Ext. Ergot. Fluid.    fl. drachm iv;\r\n      Acid. Gallic.         gr. xl;\r\n      Acid. Sulphuric. dil. fl. drachm j;\r\n      Syr. Zingiber.        fl. drachm iij;\r\n      Aquæ          q. s ad fl. oz. ij. M.\r\n\r\nS. Dessertspoonful every four hours, diluted with water.\r\n\r\nSome practitioners place a very high estimate upon the hæmostatic\r\neffects of turpentine. This is undoubtedly a most valuable and\r\naccessible remedy. Dr. Schnell of Plaquemine Parish, La., has found\r\nthe tincture of chloride of iron the best hæmostatic. He places fl.\r\ndrachm ij in fl. oz. iv of water, and directs a dessertspoonful every\r\nhour as long as the hemorrhage continues. In a great majority of cases\r\nof malarial hæmaturia occurring under my observation solutions of\r\nbitartrate of potassium have {613} been given with great apparent\r\nbenefit. Its action is certainly not that of a direct hæmostatic, but\r\nby setting up currents through the kidneys, and perhaps by some\r\nsolvent power over exudations in the uriniferous tubules, it has acted\r\nas a renal deobstructive.\r\n\r\nIn the arrest of renal secretion diuretics, cupping over the lumbar\r\nregion, and large injections of warm water into the bowels may be\r\nresorted to. Some practitioners state that they have found buchu\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nThe third indication involves a twofold duty. One relates to judicious\r\nand vigilant attention to the patient's nutrition; the other relates\r\nto such measures for depuration as may be called for in each\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that there is a degree of antagonism in the\r\nmeasures of practice proper to effect these two purposes, which\r\nrenders their coincident exercise a difficult practical question. In\r\nmany cases of hemorrhagic malarial fever a competent supply of\r\nproperly prepared foods is sufficient. In other cases--and this is\r\nespecially true of malarial hæmaturia--depurative medication becomes\r\nparamount. A person suffering under the effects of chronic malarial\r\npoisoning is seized with a chill; this is followed by bloody urine,\r\nand in the course of four or five hours intense jaundice appears.\r\nIncessant vomiting, delirium, and jactitation also occur. The\r\nexperienced physician is at once brought to the conclusion that he has\r\nto deal with a case of blood-poisoning bearing a close resemblance in\r\nsymptoms to uræmia. To render this conclusion still more absolute, he\r\nhas only to recall the suddenness of the occurrence of the jaundice\r\nand to inquire what has occasioned it. Its appearance is too rapid to\r\npermit us to ascribe it to obstruction. It is altogether improbable\r\nthat it is due to sudden hypersecretion in such pathological states of\r\nthe system as are present. If, however, we account for it by saying\r\nthat the addition of a new toxic constituent, urea and its congeners,\r\nto an already profoundly poisoned fluid suddenly arrests those\r\nprocesses which dispose of bile in physiological conditions of the\r\nsystem, it seems to me that we adopt the most rational theory. It is\r\nthen jaundice from lack of consumption. The mere probability of truth\r\nin this theory will impress the practitioner with the great importance\r\nof eliminant practice in these conditions.\r\n\r\nCalomel has been the medicine to which I have principally trusted. I\r\ngive it merely as a depurative, and not as an alterative. Doses of\r\nfrom two to ten grains may be repeated at suitable intervals until\r\ncatharsis has been produced. Bitartrate of potassium, Seidlitz\r\npowders, or solutions of citrate of magnesia may be also administered\r\nif indicated. After purgation the vomiting is mitigated, if not\r\naltogether relieved. On this account, and because of bettered states\r\nof the system for absorption and assimilation, the way is now clear to\r\nthe physician. He can ply his antiperiodics, his properly prepared\r\nsustenance, and his alcoholic stimulants according to the exigencies\r\nof each particular case.\r\n\r\nThe following propositions may seem not inappropriate in closing this\r\nsection:\r\n\r\n1st. Attacks of pernicious malarial fever are attended by more danger\r\nto life or subsequent health than simple attacks; therefore more\r\nprompt and energetic efforts should be made to cut them short by\r\ncinchonism.\r\n\r\n2d. The blood depravations of pernicious malarial fevers far exceed\r\nthose of simple cases; and therefore it becomes a leading indication\r\nof treatment to correct faulty conditions of this fluid as early as\r\npossible. {614} In endeavoring to secure this end assimilable foods,\r\nstimulants, and depurants must have a shifting scale of value\r\naccording to the exigencies of each particular case.\r\n\r\n3d. The complications of attacks of pernicious fever are far more\r\nimportant than those of simple forms; and therefore symptomatic\r\ntreatment is often urgently required.\r\n\r\n4th. Attacks of pernicious fever may be greatly diminished in number\r\nby properly directed treatment of chronic malarial toxæmia, and\r\nespecially also by the removal of persons suffering under this\r\ncachexia to non-malarious localities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypho-Malarial Fever.\r\n\r\nThe prefix typho- is properly applicable to a class of malarial fevers\r\nwhich are complicated by the specific poison which produces typhoid\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThis term was introduced into medical nomenclature by Surgeon J. J.\r\nWoodward of the United States Army. His classical paper on this\r\nsubject has been published in the _Transactions_ of the International\r\nMedical Congress at Philadelphia in 1876. The following extract from\r\nthe proceedings of this congress will show the interpretation of this\r\nterm by Woodward:\r\n\r\n\"On motion of Dr. Woodward, seconded by Dr. Pepper, the following was\r\nadopted as expressing the opinion of the section: Typho-malarial fever\r\nis not a specific or distinct type of disease, but the term may be\r\nconveniently applied to the compound forms of fever which result from\r\nthe combined influence of the causes of the malarious fevers and of\r\ntyphoid fever.\"\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the term should be so restricted as to\r\ndefine a disease compounded of the two pathological factors which when\r\nacting separately produce either typhoid or malarial fever.\r\n\r\nWhen understood in this sense, and carefully employed, the term\r\nappears to me unobjectionable. Perhaps, indeed, it may be a convenient\r\naddition to medical nomenclature. If such a name had not been\r\nintroduced, we would be forced to speak of these cases of compound\r\ndisease as complications. As it is customary to regard the minor or\r\nless important affection as the complicating disorder, we would often\r\nhave confusion in determining whether the case should be typhoid fever\r\ncomplicated by malaria or malarial fever complicated by typhoid. This\r\nterm leaves all questions of precedence or predominance in abeyance.\r\n\r\nThere are no facts, however, which support a conclusion that the\r\nmalarial poison is capable of forming combinations with the particular\r\npoisons of other specific fevers and give birth to a new special\r\npoison, which may be perpetuated by successive generations, and thus\r\nproduce epidemics of a new but compound disease.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a proper use of the term typho-malarial implies\r\nco-ordinate care in diagnosing the true nature of the malady it should\r\ndefine.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in brief, that the diagnosis of typho-malarial fever\r\nmust rest upon the blending of the symptomatic phenomena peculiar\r\n{615} to each one of the two fevers which enter into combination. In\r\nother words, if the differential diagnosis between the two diseases\r\nwhen they are distinct is made by contrasting the symptoms peculiar to\r\neach, the compound disease is to be recognized by more or less\r\npositive combinations of these symptoms.\r\n\r\nThese blended symptoms should not be expected to exhibit the results\r\nof a copartnership in which each member exerts equal influence. It is\r\nwell understood that when two diseases coincide, that one which is\r\nmore violent or excessive in its morbid process holds so much sway as\r\nin some cases almost to extinguish the symptoms of the weaker member\r\nof the combination. Consequently, in typho-malarial fever, the\r\ntyphoid, being the graver of the two forms of disease, ordinarily\r\nrules the pathology.\r\n\r\nThe following notes, accompanied by a temperature chart, will\r\nillustrate the clinical course of a case of typho-malarial fever:\r\n\r\nJ. L., aged thirty years, of French nativity, but a resident of New\r\nOrleans for three years, was admitted to Ward 21, Bed 311, Charity\r\nHospital, on the night of December 10, 1881. Had been ill some days\r\nwith ague. The house-surgeon administered gr. x. of quinia in solution\r\nand gtt. xv. of tincture of opium.\r\n\r\nThe records and temperature date from the 12th of December. During the\r\n11th he took drachm ij sulph. cinch. in solution.\r\n\r\n{617} [Illustration: FIG. 24. PART I., showing the temperature-curve\r\nfrom December 12th to 31st, inclusive, during which time the more\r\ncharacteristic typhoid symptoms predominated. PART II., showing the\r\ntemperature-curve in same case from January 1st to 20th, inclusive,\r\nduring which the influence of the associated malarial poison was\r\nprominent.]\r\n\r\nDec. 13th, tenderness and gurgling in ileo-cæcal region; epistaxis;\r\nrose spots on abdomen; deafness and ataxia; no stools since 11th.\r\nOrdered\r\n\r\n  Rx. Acid. Sulphuric. dil.,\r\n      Syr. Aurantii Cort. _aa._ fl. drachm ij;\r\n      Tinct. Cinchonæ Co.       fl. oz. j. M.\r\n\r\nS. Teaspoonful in water every four hours.\r\n\r\nAlso ordered beef-essence, milk-punch, and milk.\r\n\r\nDec. 13th, two very offensive liquid stools; ataxia greater; skin\r\nyellow and countenance dull and listless. Dec. 14th, fresh rose spots;\r\ntongue brown and dry; three stools; much jactitation. Dec. 15th, more\r\nataxia; some delirium; pulse 100, weak. Gave gr. iiss quinia in\r\nsolution, with tincture opium gtt. iii, every two hours. Dec. 16th,\r\npulse 128, weak; delirious. Dec. 17, new rose spots; belly tympanitic;\r\ntongue brown, dry; sordes on teeth and lips; eyes injected; very\r\ndelirious. Treatment continued; nutrition and stimulants given\r\nmethodically. From 17th to 22d but little change in condition or\r\ntreatment. Diet and stimulants administered regularly. Dec. 22d, coma\r\nvigil; completely delirious. Ordered\r\n\r\n  Rx. Liq. Morphiæ Sulph.,\r\n      Tinct. Digitalis _aa._ fl. drachm iij;\r\n      Spts. Æther. Nitrosi   fl. drachm ij;\r\n      Liq. Potass. Citrat.   fl. oz. iij. M.\r\n\r\nS. Tablespoonful every three hours.\r\n\r\nAs the oscillations of temperature became more marked, quinia was\r\nresorted to, apparently with good effect. The patient was discharged\r\nfrom the hospital Feb. 8, 1882.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that after the 14th of December the patient's\r\nbowels were rather costive, and the stools occasionally moulded and\r\nvery {616} dark in color. On the forty-fifth day after admission the\r\npatient had a severe chill, followed by a rise of temperature to 104°.\r\nThis yielded to competent doses of sulphate of cinchonidia.\r\n\r\nThis was a typical case of typho-malarial fever. The blended symptoms,\r\nas well as those special to each disease, are sufficiently exhibited\r\nin the clinical account. The presence of typhoid fever was established\r\nby the rose spots and the marked nervous symptoms. The typhoid process\r\nseems to have been unusually mild in so far as evidence of bowel\r\nlesions were made manifest.\r\n\r\nThe history of the patient before admission, the color of his skin and\r\nstools, and the temperature curves gave abundant proofs of the\r\nmalarial element in the pathology of the case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing need be added on the subject of diagnosis. I may,\r\nhowever, remark that I am very cautious in asserting the diagnosis of\r\ntypho-malarial cases unless the nervous symptoms, positively-marked\r\nbowel symptoms, or rose spots are present to vindicate such a\r\ndecision. The presence of malarial poison may be determined with less\r\ndifficulty from the previous history of the case and its special\r\nsymptoms in the early stages of an attack. But if the morbid processes\r\nof the typhoid poison are violent, there are likely to be stages of\r\nthe disease when it is not possible to detect symptoms which indicate\r\nthe presence of malaria. On the other hand, it is unquestionably true\r\nthat the typhoid condition, as it is termed, which so often\r\ncomplicates malarial fevers, can very generally be differentiated from\r\ntrue typhoid fever. While certain cases, or even epidemics, of\r\nmalarial fevers are attended by remarkable adynamia, often manifesting\r\nitself from the very incipiency of attacks, it differs widely from\r\nthat utter nervous ataxia which characterizes typhoid fever. Again,\r\nthe adynamia of malarial attacks is generally ascribable to some cause\r\nnot essential to those affections. Imperfect reaction from a chill,\r\nlong persistent hyperpyrexia, diarrhoea or vomiting, or chronic\r\npaludal cachexia, or, it may be, some epidemic influence, may produce\r\nit. The ataxia of typhoid fever is part of its morbid process.\r\n\r\nWoodward's statistics show that 49,871 cases of fever diagnosed as\r\ntypho-malarial occurred among the white forces of the United States\r\nduring the late Civil War. Of this number, 4059 proved fatal, a\r\nmortality-rate of 8.13 + per cent. Among the colored troops 7529 cases\r\noccurred, with 1301 deaths, a mortality-rate of 17.27. Statistics\r\nborrowed from the same excellent authority give the number of cases of\r\nunmixed typhoid fever (or fever classed as typhoid without reference\r\nto any complication) as 75,368 among the white troops, with 27,056\r\ndeaths, a mortality-rate of 35.89. Among the colored troops 4094 cases\r\noccurred, and 2280 died, a mortality-rate of 55.68. These figures show\r\nvery singular comparative results. They prove that typhoid fever as an\r\nuncomplicated malady, was four and a half times as fatal among the\r\nwhites as the same disease when in combination with malarial poison.\r\nAmong the colored troops typhoid fever was three and a half times more\r\nfatal than typho-malarial fever.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that inaccuracies exist in statistics gathered\r\nin the confusion of a great civil war, but I am not prepared to say\r\nthat the conclusions they point to are incorrect. When an acute\r\ninflammation is complicated by malaria, its prognosis is rendered more\r\ngrave. This, no doubt, {618} is due in part to degradations of the\r\nfluids of the system by the malarial poison, and in part to the\r\nrevulsions of circulation during paroxysms. But it does not follow\r\nfrom this fact that the presence of malaria in the blood, or its\r\neffects upon that fluid, exercise an unhappy influence upon diseases\r\ndue to other specific poisons. It may, on the contrary, be ascertained\r\nin the future that it modifies the typhoid process, so as to deprive\r\nit of some of its most dangerous features.\r\n\r\nFurther investigations are required to determine the facts in regard\r\nto these questions. But it may be premised that if such a conclusion\r\nshall ever be reached, it will influence our expectations of cure\r\nrather than our practice. If the malarial poison is capable of\r\nmodifying the toxic effects of the typhoid poison, it must do so in\r\nthe very formative stages of that affection, if not in its incubative\r\nperiod, so that, having accomplished all the good it is capable of\r\neffecting, we may proceed at once to rid ourselves of its presence.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the treatment of two diseases compounded in the same\r\npatient, if one should ordinarily be amenable to specific treatment,\r\nit must certainly be wise practice to endeavor to simplify the case by\r\nsubtracting that one from its composition. This is more especially\r\ntrue if the treatment does not affect the course of the other disease\r\nin any injurious manner. It is therefore proper to begin the treatment\r\nof a case of typho-malarial fever by administering large doses of\r\nquinia. A scruple may be given every fourth hour, until its effects in\r\neliminating symptoms ascribable to malaria, and also as an\r\nantipyretic, have been sufficiently tested. In the early stages of\r\ntypho-malarial attacks the febrile exacerbations conform to those laws\r\nof periodicity which govern uncomplicated malarial fevers. After the\r\nfirst week, or when the typhoid process has become well established,\r\nperiodic returns of the fever are less plainly observable. It is\r\npossible that in some cases in which the typhoid process manifests\r\nitself with great severity the temperature curves may be very\r\ncharacteristic of that disease. I am satisfied that the indications\r\nfor giving quinia to eliminate the malarial element must be based upon\r\nthe fever curves which mark the case. Perhaps a more frequent\r\napplication of the thermometer would often exhibit malarial\r\nperiodicity where it may otherwise remain unsuspected. I know this to\r\nbe very often the case in pneumonia complicated by a malarial fever.\r\n\r\nWhether thorough cinchonism in the early progress of the attack rids\r\nthe case of symptoms due to malaria or not, only a very few days are\r\nlikely to elapse before oscillations of temperature call for its\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nThe typhoid processes require very much the same measures which are\r\napplicable in uncomplicated cases of that disease. The stools of the\r\nearly stages of attacks should not be checked unless excessive, and\r\nmercurials and laxatives should be more freely used than in simple\r\ntyphoid fever. The effects of the malarial fever and of the\r\nhyperpyrexia of typhoid fever, when combined, must almost necessarily\r\nentail more accumulation of excrementitious material in the blood than\r\nwould occur either disease existing separately. On this account\r\neliminating treatment is an important indication. When it becomes\r\nnecessary to check the diarrhoea because excessive or on account of\r\nfailing strength, diuretics subsequently prove serviceable.\r\nEffervescing solutions of potassium or ammonium, lemonade, Apollinaris\r\nwater, iced tea, strawberry, mulberry, or raspberry juice, are {619}\r\ngrateful beverages and increase renal activity. The mineral acids may\r\nbe given during the ulcerative periods of the disease. Insomnia must\r\nbe relieved by opiates, chloral hydrate, or other hypnotics.\r\n\r\nTympanites should be met by warm stupes, large enemas of warm water\r\nwith fl. drachm j tincture of asafoetida or fl. oz. j of whiskey.\r\nSmall doses of turpentine in emulsion are often beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn the early progress of cases the diet should consist of farinaceous\r\nfoods, with milk and the pulps or juices of fresh fruits, given either\r\ncooked or in their natural state as the physician may determine for\r\neach patient. Methodical and forced nutrition becomes necessary at\r\nmore or less early periods in different cases.\r\n\r\nThe stools and all ejecta of the sick should be disinfected and\r\ndisposed of with the same care and for the same purpose as those of\r\nunmixed typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{620}\r\n\r\nPAROTITIS.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN M. KEATING, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term parotitis is applied to a condition of painful enlargement of\r\none or both parotid glands, inflammatory in nature, acute in its\r\ncourse, and usually subsiding by resolution, but sometimes ending in\r\nsuppuration. The different methods of termination, together with\r\ncertain etiological distinctions, form the basis of a division of the\r\naffection into two sub-classes--namely, 1, idiopathic parotitis; and\r\n2, symptomatic or metastatic parotitis. These demand separate\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Idiopathic Parotitis.\r\n\r\nIdiopathic parotitis, parotitis epidemica, or mumps, as it is\r\nvariously named, is an acute contagious inflammation of one or both\r\nparotid glands, which usually appears but once in a lifetime, and\r\nwhich, although by no means limited to children, is commonly met with\r\nbetween the second year and the age of puberty. In certain exceptional\r\ncases the disease affects the submaxillary glands alone.\r\n\r\nNATURE.--The undoubted contagiousness of mumps, with the fact of its\r\nfrequently occurring in extended epidemics, entitles it to a place\r\namong the zymotic diseases, from which it differs, however, in the\r\nmarked disproportion between the local and constitutional symptoms,\r\nthe former being well developed, the latter but slight or altogether\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--While it is more than probable that, like the other\r\ndiseases of the zymotic class, mumps is due to a contagium that finds\r\nits way into the body in the inspired air or with the food or drink,\r\nnothing is known of the nature of this infecting principle.\r\n\r\nThe predisposing agencies are better understood. Age is one of these,\r\nthe greater number of cases occurring, as already stated, between the\r\nsecond and the fifteenth year. Infants at the breast are almost\r\nentirely exempt, and so, too, are individuals advanced in years. In\r\nextended epidemics it is not unusual to meet with cases in adults, but\r\nit will generally be found on careful examination that these patients\r\nhave escaped the disease during childhood. Sex exerts some influence,\r\na much larger percentage of males being attacked than females.\r\nEpidemics appear more frequently in the spring and fall than at the\r\nother seasons of the year, so that cold and dampness of the atmosphere\r\nmust be looked upon as predisposing causes. Mumps bears a peculiar\r\nrelation to measles, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, epidemics being\r\napt to occur directly before, during, or immediately after the\r\nprevalence of either of these affections, especially {621} the first.\r\nThe popular idea of mutual protection is entirely without foundation.\r\n\r\nCertain peculiarities are presented by the disease in its mode of\r\noccurrence and in the duration and intensity of its epidemics. Thus,\r\nsome localities are visited annually, others only at intervals of\r\nthirty years or more; again, one epidemic may last but a few weeks and\r\naffect a small number of individuals, while another extends over\r\nmonths and attacks all the children and many of the adults in the\r\naffected region.\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The exact pathological lesion in mumps is\r\nobscure, since the trifling nature of the disease and the almost\r\ninvariable termination in recovery afford no opportunity for\r\npost-mortem investigation. According to Foerster, who seems to have\r\nmade examinations in cases where mumps occurred as one of the\r\naccidental complications of other and fatal diseases, the affected\r\ngland at first becomes hyperæmic, and is then the seat of serous\r\nexudation. It is reddened, swollen, and on section presents a uniform\r\nflesh-like, moist appearance, in place of the ordinary granular\r\naspect. The tumor is often greatly increased in size by a simultaneous\r\nserous infiltration of the periglandular connective tissue, and\r\noccasionally this tissue alone is involved, the gland itself being\r\nentirely free from lesion. The great point in favor of this view of\r\nthe pathology is the rapid and complete subsidence of the parotid\r\nswelling by resolution--a termination to be expected only when the\r\ninflammatory process stops short of suppuration or fibrinous\r\nexudation.\r\n\r\nVirchow regards all cases of parotitis as the result of an extension\r\nof a more or less malignant catarrh originally affecting the\r\ngland-ducts. This is undoubtedly true in some cases, but that it is\r\nfar from being the rule is proved by the infrequency of parotitis as a\r\nsecondary complication of catarrhal affections of the mucous membrane\r\nof the mouth.\r\n\r\nCOURSE AND SYMPTOMS.--The course of the disease is susceptible of a\r\ndivision into three stages--a period of incubation, of invasion, and\r\nof actual attack.\r\n\r\nThe stage of incubation extends over a period variously estimated as\r\nfrom seven to fourteen days. It is marked by no symptoms, though\r\nsometimes a history of impaired appetite and digestion, irregular\r\nbowels, and languor during the last two or three days may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe period of invasion is short, lasting only twelve, or at the most\r\ntwenty-four, hours. The patient is pale and languid, has slight\r\nrigors, pains in the breast and head, and loss of appetite; later,\r\nlocal pain in the parotid region on moving the jaws or on taking acid\r\nliquids into the mouth. The surface temperature increases from hour to\r\nhour, and just before the glandular swelling appears it reaches 100°\r\nor 101° F. In some cases the invasion is characterized by the same\r\ntrain of symptoms that ushers in the acute exanthemata, such as\r\nrepeated vomiting, diarrhoea, restlessness and anxiety, a disposition\r\nto syncope, and, in very irritable children, convulsions. Contrasted\r\nwith this violent invasion other cases are met with, in which there\r\nare no prodromes whatever except a gradual rise in temperature,\r\nimperceptible without the use of the thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of actual attack is a peculiar slight stitch-like\r\npain in one parotid region, usually the left. This radiates toward the\r\near of the affected side, and is increased by movements of the jaw, as\r\nin {622} chewing or talking, and by external pressure. The pain\r\nrapidly grows more intense, and soon becomes associated with swelling.\r\nThe tumor first appears in the depression between the mastoid process\r\nand the ramus of the jaw, which it fills up, and at the same time\r\nthrusts outward the lobe of the ear. As the gland alone is swollen at\r\nfirst, the tumor has the outline of a triangle, with the apex directed\r\ndownward and forward; soon, however, the connective tissue becomes\r\noedematous and the swelling is greatly extended, involving the cheeks\r\nand neck, in the latter region, in severe cases, running forward as\r\nfar as the median line, downward nearly to the shoulder and backward\r\ntoward the spine. The most prominent point is directly in front of the\r\near. The oedema also extends internally, involving the pharynx, the\r\ntonsils, and sometimes even the larynx. The skin covering the tumor is\r\neither perfectly natural in color or slightly reddened. The central\r\nportion is firm and elastic to the touch, the periphery doughy, and\r\npressure here often produces pitting. There is but moderate\r\ntenderness. The swelling reaches its height in three days, remains\r\nstationary for two days longer, and then rapidly declines, the oedema\r\nfirst disappearing and afterward the glandular swelling, the process\r\nof resolution occupying four or five days and being attended with a\r\nslight desquamation of the cuticle.\r\n\r\nWhile mumps almost uniformly begins on one side, both glands are, as a\r\nrule, affected during the attack. The second tumor begins to develop\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours after the first, though its\r\nappearance may be delayed much longer, even until resolution has begun\r\non the side primarily affected. As the course of the inflammation is\r\nsimilar in both parotids, the whole duration of the attack will depend\r\non the time of involvement of the second gland.\r\n\r\nAmong the other symptoms an alteration of expression is prominent. At\r\nfirst, the head is inclined toward the affected side; later, when both\r\nglands are involved, it is held perfectly erect, and, as the slightest\r\nmovement increases the pain, it is maintained stiffly in this\r\nposition. The swelling of the cheeks prevents all play of the\r\nfeatures, and this, combined with widely-open, staring eyes and\r\nincreased thickness of the neck, gives the patient a stupid, almost\r\nidiotic, expression. The swelling of the neck is sometimes so great\r\nthat its diameter exceeds that of the head, and the shoulders, neck,\r\nand head, viewed together, have the outline of a truncated pyramid.\r\n\r\nAs any movement of the lower jaw greatly augments the suffering, the\r\nmouth is kept closed, often so tightly that it is impossible to see\r\nmore than the tip of the tongue. All efforts at mastication are\r\nsuspended, and deglutition is so painful, especially when the tonsils\r\nbecome enlarged, that the sufferer bears the pangs of hunger and\r\nthirst rather than endure the agony entailed in satisfying his wants.\r\nThe act of speaking even augments the pain; the voice, when heard, has\r\na nasal tone. The acuteness of hearing is impaired, there are singing\r\nnoises and shooting pains in the ears, headache, and sometimes, in\r\nextreme cases, symptoms of cerebral hyperæmia due to pressure upon the\r\ncervical veins.\r\n\r\nThe tongue is heavily coated, the mouth is either dry or there is an\r\nincreased flow of saliva, and the fluid dribbling from the mouth adds\r\nanother element to the idiotic expression already referred to. There\r\nis loss of appetite, increased thirst, occasionally vomiting, and\r\ncommonly {623} constipation. The temperature is elevated and the pulse\r\nincreased in frequency, both to a moderate degree. The respiration is\r\nunaffected, except when the oedema has invaded the submucous\r\nconnective tissue of the larynx; then the movements are increased in\r\nfrequency and difficult.\r\n\r\nThroughout the attack the pain, unless intensified by some extraneous\r\ninfluence, as pressure or the act of speaking or swallowing, is only\r\nmoderately severe. In ordinary cases the patient rests quietly and\r\nsleep is undisturbed, unless the tonsils are enlarged, when it is\r\nliable to interruption from loud snoring. When the attack is severe\r\nand in nervous, excitable children there is restlessness,\r\nsleeplessness, and slight delirium at night.\r\n\r\nThe general symptoms keep pace with the local in their increase, but\r\nthey commence to subside before, beginning to disappear while the\r\nswelling remains stationary. As soon as resolution sets in the general\r\nand local improvement are both rapid, and by the end of the week\r\nnothing is left but a trifling weakness and pallor, which disappear in\r\na few days more, leaving the patient perfectly well.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary symptoms, mumps in certain instances shows a\r\npeculiar tendency to metastasis, or secondary involvement, of the\r\ntesticle and scrotum in males, and the mammæ, vulva, and ovaries in\r\nfemales. This metastasis occurs much more frequently in males than in\r\nfemales, and is usually met with in pubescents and adults, being very\r\nrare either in childhood or old age. It generally begins six or eight\r\ndays after the appearance of the parotid tumor. The latter, as a rule,\r\nsubsides on the occurrence of any of these metastatic affections,\r\nthough occasionally the two run a simultaneous course. This\r\noccurrence, together with the fact of the secondary inflammation\r\nappearing at the date on which the parotitis naturally begins to\r\ndisappear, tends to support Niemeyer's view, that the two affections\r\nare in reality due to the same cause, and that no true transference of\r\ninflammation takes place from one point to the other. Occasionally,\r\nthe parotitis disappears a variable time before the onset of the\r\nmetastatic affection; then the interval is marked by grave symptoms of\r\ndepression and cerebral disturbance, but there are no proofs of actual\r\nmeningeal involvement. In these cases there is, at times, an excessive\r\nelevation of temperature, which may account for the brain symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe most constant secondary manifestation is swelling of the testicle\r\nproper, or true orchitis; less frequently there is epididymitis, and\r\nwith it acute hydrocele and oedema of the scrotum. The orchitis in\r\nmost cases is unilateral, the right testicle being affected, just the\r\nopposite to the parotids, of which the left is the one first involved.\r\nWhen the orchitis is double, both testicles do not become swollen at\r\nonce, the one preceding the other by an interval of several days.\r\n\r\nThe course of the orchitis is very similar to that of the mumps, the\r\ninflammation increasing gradually for from three to six days, then\r\nundergoing rapid resolution, the gland returning to its normal\r\ncondition by the end of two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe local symptoms are swelling, the testicle being enlarged to two or\r\nthree times its natural size, dull pain, and moderate tenderness,\r\nwhile in very severe cases there is burning on micturition and a\r\npurulent discharge from the urethra. The spermatic cord does not\r\nsympathize in the {624} inflammation, and neither the swelling, pain,\r\nnor tenderness is so great as in specific orchitis.\r\n\r\nThe general symptoms are confined to a moderate elevation of\r\ntemperature and increase in the frequency of the pulse, thirst, and\r\nloss of appetite. This fever is separated from that of the parotitis\r\nby an interval of two or three days.\r\n\r\nThe course of bilateral orchitis is longer by forty-eight hours than\r\nthat of the unilateral form, and the attending fever is more intense.\r\n\r\nThe rapid return of the testicle to its natural size and shape shows\r\nthat, as in the parotid glands, the inflammation does not extend\r\nbeyond the stage of serous exudation.\r\n\r\nTHE DIAGNOSIS of mumps is easy after the disease is sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to produce the characteristic alterations in the facial\r\nexpression. In the earlier stages the position of the swelling,\r\nimmediately beneath and in front of the ear, its triangular shape, and\r\nthe elevation and outward displacement of the lobe of the ear of the\r\naffected side, distinguish it from the enlargement of the cervical\r\nlymph-glands so liable to occur in strumous subjects. The acute onset\r\nand course of mumps are the points of distinction between it and\r\nmorbid growths, or the very rare condition of chronic hypertrophy of\r\nthe parotid gland. The metastatic orchitis cannot be mistaken for\r\ngonorrhoeal orchitis if the least care is taken to investigate the\r\nhistory in either case.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGNOSIS is extremely favorable, there being no record of a fatal\r\ncase of uncomplicated mumps. Suppuration may occur, but it is an\r\nexceedingly rare event. In scrofulous children the course may be\r\nprotracted for several weeks, and in them resolution is occasionally\r\nimperfect, a degree of enlargement and induration of one or both\r\nparotids remaining for some time.\r\n\r\nMetastatic orchitis, as a rule, leaves the testicle in a normal\r\ncondition, but, according to Vogel, in some epidemics complete atrophy\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nDogmy reports an epidemic which raged in a garrison of Mount Louis in\r\nJanuary, 1828. Of sixty-nine bilateral and eighteen unilateral cases\r\nof parotitis, metastasis to both testicles occurred in four cases, all\r\nof which resulted in atrophy of the affected testicle.\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT is simple. The patient should be kept in a uniform\r\ntemperature, confined to one room, or, better still, to bed, until\r\nresolution is well established. While the difficulty in swallowing and\r\nfever continue the food should consist of milk and beef-tea; later,\r\nother nutritious articles of diet may be added as the appetite\r\ndemands. Water, iced carbonic acid water, or lemonade may be allowed\r\nas freely as the patient will take them, to allay the thirst. A daily\r\nevacuation of the bowels must be secured by the use of saline\r\nlaxatives. During the early stage, if the fever be high, tincture of\r\naconite-root should be cautiously administered; afterward liquor\r\npotassii citratis will sufficiently fill the indications for a\r\nfebrifuge. Tonics are required during the decline of the disease; of\r\nthis class of remedies, syrup of the iodide of iron, bitter wine of\r\niron, and ferrated elixir of cinchona are most useful.\r\n\r\nSpecial symptoms may demand attention. For example, headache and\r\ndelirium should be relieved by hot mustard foot-baths and moist cold\r\nto the forehead; difficult deglutition from enlargement of the\r\ntonsils, by the frequent swallowing of bits of ice, or, if possible,\r\nby the application of {625} astringent lotions, as tannic acid and\r\nglycerine (one drachm to the ounce); sleeplessness, by the\r\nadministration of bromide of potassium, with or without small doses of\r\nhydrate of chloral in children and of some preparation of opium in\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nIn the way of local treatment the best results and greatest relief to\r\nsuffering will be obtained by gently rubbing the swollen glands with a\r\nmixture of tincture of opium and sweet oil (one drachm to the ounce),\r\nthree times daily, and in the mean while keeping the parts enveloped\r\nwith a moderately thick layer of cotton wadding covered by oiled silk.\r\nWater dressings or light poultices may be used with advantage. When\r\nresolution begins a more stimulating lotion will hasten the\r\ndisappearance of the swelling.\r\n\r\nIn the exceptional instances in which the skin covering the tumor\r\nbecomes tense and red, and suppuration is threatened, two or three\r\nleeches may be applied behind the ear of the affected side. When\r\nsuppuration has actually taken place the abscess should be immediately\r\nopened to prevent further destruction of the gland-tissue and\r\nperforation into the external auditory meatus.\r\n\r\nIf, particularly in strumous subjects, resolution be incomplete and\r\nglandular enlargement and induration remain after the cessation of the\r\nacute symptoms, cod-liver oil and iodide of iron are demanded for\r\ninternal administration and the compound ointment of iodine for\r\nexternal application. It is well to dilute the latter sufficiently to\r\nprevent its causing irritation of the skin, and to apply it twice\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nWhen metastasis occurs, the return of fever calls for the same general\r\ntreatment as in the early stage of parotitis. In addition, an emetic\r\nshould be given, as this often cuts short the fever or causes it to\r\ndisappear more rapidly. The patient must be kept at perfect rest in\r\nbed, with the scrotum elevated by a cushion and covered with warm\r\nanodyne lotions. Salines must be administered sufficiently often to\r\nsecure regular and free action of the bowels.\r\n\r\nWhen the mammæ or ovaries are secondarily attacked, the seat for local\r\ntreatment is of course different, but in all other respects the\r\nmanagement must be the same.\r\n\r\nFor the uncommon cases in which the transference of the inflammation\r\nis attended with depression stimulants are required, and for those in\r\nwhich meningitis is threatened cutting off the hair and the\r\napplication of cold to the head, hot mustard foot-baths, local and\r\ngeneral venesection, drastics, and irritants to the cutaneous surface,\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Symptomatic or Metastatic Parotitis.\r\n\r\nSymptomatic, metastatic, malignant, or suppurative parotitis, as the\r\ncondition is variously designated, is an inflammation of the parotid\r\ngland which occurs during the course of different grave acute\r\ndiseases, is usually unilateral, and terminates in suppuration, or\r\nmuch more rarely in gangrene, of the gland involved.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--It may occur in association with typhus, typhoid,\r\nrelapsing, puerperal, and scarlet fevers, or with the plague, measles,\r\ndysentery, cholera, and pyæmia, springing into notice at different\r\nperiods of the {626} course of these affections, which may be regarded\r\nas predisposing causes. The exciting cause is perhaps mechanical in\r\nnature--namely, the excessive dryness of the mucous membrane of the\r\nmouth so common in the severe fevers. This dryness may lead to an\r\nocclusion of the orifice of the parotid duct, with retention of the\r\nsaliva, which fluid, undergoing decomposition, may act as an irritant,\r\nproducing inflammation, and finally suppuration, of the glandular\r\ntissue. This is a likely enough explanation of the causation in some\r\ncases, but dryness of the mouth is such a uniform symptom in fever,\r\nand suppurative parotitis such a comparatively rare complication, that\r\nit cannot be a very active or common cause. Nevertheless, it is\r\nimpossible to fix upon any other direct cause, though the altered\r\ncondition of the blood in the conditions mentioned must not be lost\r\nsight of as an important etiological factor.\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The character of the pathological lesions\r\nhave been well established, owing to the frequent opportunities that\r\narise of examining the diseased gland at different stages of the\r\ninflammatory process. When the inflammation has lasted a short time, a\r\nday or two, the tubes and acini of the gland are seen on section to be\r\nswollen and reddened, and the connective tissue infiltrated with serum\r\nand yellowish-red in color; a fluid, either viscid, ropy, grayish in\r\ncolor, or more purulent in character, fills the duct, and may be\r\nforced out into the mouth by stroking it in the direction of the\r\norifice. If of several days' longer duration, purulent softening will\r\nbe noticed in the centre of the acini; this gradually extends until\r\neach acinus is converted into a little sac of pus. Then the\r\ninter-acinous connective tissue breaks down, and the multiple, minute,\r\npurulent collections become converted into a single large abscess or\r\ninto two or more smaller ones. Next, the pus seeks an outlet. The\r\nposition of pointing may be on the cheek or in the external auditory\r\nmeatus--a very common location; again, the abscess may break into the\r\nmouth, the pharynx, the oesophagus, or into the anterior mediastinum,\r\nthe pus burrowing its way along the sheath of the\r\nsterno-cleido-mastoid muscle.\r\n\r\nWhile the parotid abscess is forming, suppurative inflammation is apt\r\nto be set up in the masseter, pterygoid, and temporal muscles, and\r\nfrom these positions the pus forces its way upward to the temporal or\r\nzygomatic fossæ. The periosteum of the neighboring bones, and even the\r\nbones themselves, may become involved, and sometimes the cranial bones\r\nare partially destroyed, and there is an extension of the inflammation\r\nto the brain or its membranes. The middle ear may participate in the\r\ngeneral destruction, and the patient is left permanently deaf, if\r\nindeed he escape with his life.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatics, veins, and nerves traversing the parotid are affected\r\nby the suppuration in the gland. Irritation of the lymph-vessels\r\nresults in swelling, tenderness, and suppuration of the lymph-glands.\r\nThrombi form in the jugular vein and its branches, and by breaking\r\ndown lead to septicæmia and ichorization of the sinuses of the dura\r\nmater. The nerves resist for a long time, but seem to act as paths of\r\nconduction of the inflammation, the facial nerve leading it to the\r\near, and the branches of the trifacial to the brain. When gangrene of\r\nthe gland takes place, the traversing nerves as well as the gland\r\nelements are rapidly destroyed.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Symptomatic parotitis, occurring during the course of {627}\r\nany of the diseases already named, produces no change in the general\r\nsymptoms; if, on the other hand, it occurs during convalescence, the\r\nonset is marked by a moderate elevation of temperature and increase in\r\nthe frequency of the pulse, by thirst, loss of appetite, and sluggish\r\nbowels. The tumor, which occupies the same position and thrusts\r\noutward the ear-lobe as in mumps, is hard, dense, well defined, and\r\nthe seat of considerable pain until suppuration takes place, when the\r\nlatter subsides greatly. The skin over it is red, hot, and tense, and\r\nthere is much tenderness and little or no pitting on pressure. After\r\nthe abscess has formed there is well-defined fluctuation on palpation,\r\nand at the position of pointing the skin becomes very thin and assumes\r\na bluish-red hue. Gangrene of the gland is manifested by the\r\ncadaverous odor, blackening of the skin, the formation of a cavity,\r\nand the discharge of ichor and shreds of tissue. The alteration in the\r\nexpression, the pain in the ear, the difficulty in moving the jaw and\r\nin swallowing, are as constantly present here as in idiopathic mumps.\r\nIt must not be forgotten, though, that when the disease arises during\r\nthe course of any of the severe infectious diseases, the brain may be\r\nso overcome that the subjective symptoms are frequently not complained\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe course is usually rapid, the abscess pointing on the fourth or\r\nfifth day after the appearance of the parotid tumor; occasionally,\r\nhowever, the inflammatory process is much slower, extending over a\r\nperiod of several weeks. The course is also much protracted when\r\nsecondary abscesses form in other parts of the gland or in the\r\nsurrounding tissues, when the abscess is transformed into an ichorous\r\ncavity, and when gangrene sets in. Ordinarily, where the pus is\r\nevacuated by spontaneous rupture or by incision the abscess heals\r\nquickly by granulation, leaving the gland enlarged and indurated for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGNOSIS depends upon the gravity of the original disease, the\r\nperiod of the disease at which the complication occurs, and whether or\r\nno mortification sets in. When the vital processes are greatly\r\nimpaired by the primary disease, the onset of the parotitis, trifling\r\nin itself, may prove sufficient to determine a fatal result. The\r\ndanger of such a result is much increased, too, if the inflammation\r\nbegins in the earlier stages or during the height of the disease which\r\nit complicates, while if it commences during convalescence by far the\r\nmost frequent result is recovery. Gangrene of the gland involves great\r\nrisk of life--a risk which increases in proportion to the early date\r\nof its onset in the course of the original disease. Even when the\r\ngangrenous process ends in recovery, the face is much distorted, the\r\nhearing is lost in the ear, and the facial muscles are paralyzed on\r\nthe affected side. Bilateral symptomatic parotitis has naturally a\r\ngraver prognosis than the unilateral form.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The disease is readily distinguished from idiopathic mumps\r\nby the history, the less marked degree of the enlargement and\r\nsurrounding oedema, the greater degree of pain and tenderness, the\r\nhardness of the tumor, the red discoloration of the skin covering it,\r\nand the termination in suppuration. Further, it never displays an\r\nepidemic tendency.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--The general treatment of this form does not differ from\r\nthat of the disease it complicates, though the employment of\r\nstimulants in increased quantities may be indicated.\r\n\r\n{628} Before the first appearance of tumefaction of the parotid the\r\nintroduction of a probe or canula into the duct of Steno, associated\r\nwith pressure on the gland from the outside, may, by forcing from the\r\nduct a collection of mucus or muco-pus, abort the inflammation. If\r\nthis is unsuccessful, a poultice should be applied over the gland to\r\nencourage suppuration and pointing externally. As soon as the abscess\r\npoints the pus must be evacuated by an incision, and, as this has a\r\ntendency to close again, a piece of lint must be kept between the lips\r\nof the wound.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement and induration left after the healing of the abscess\r\nrequire the application of tincture of iodine or of compound iodine\r\nointment to the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen gangrene occurs it demands the same treatment, both local and\r\ngeneral, as when it is seated elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{629}\r\n\r\nERYSIPELAS.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES NEVINS HYDE, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Erysipelas is an acute disorder, characterized by the\r\nsystemic symptoms common to the febrile state, and by an involvement\r\nof the integument and deeper parts, the affected surface being tumid,\r\nhot, reddened, painful, and often the seat of well-defined bullæ, the\r\nprocess terminating either in complete resolution after cutaneous\r\ndesquamation or in a fatal result commonly due to complications of the\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--_Eng._ St. Anthony's Fire; _Fr._ Érysipèle; _Germ._\r\nRothlauf; _Ital._ Risipolo.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.--Erysipelas is properly recognized as one of the acute\r\ninfectious diseases. Though by its symptoms and career it would seem\r\nto be properly assigned to the category of the exanthemata, it is yet\r\nby most authors set apart from the latter--first, because its career\r\nis less specifically defined; second, because its contagiousness is\r\nless demonstrable in every case; third, because one attack is not\r\nknown to confer upon its victims immunity against a second; fourth,\r\nbecause the occasional prevalence of the disease in apparently\r\nepidemic form is evidently due to extrinsic causes, and does not\r\ndepend exclusively upon its sudden appearance among the unprotected;\r\nfifth, because no definite period of incubation precedes its earliest\r\nmanifestations; and, sixth, because at times it appears in local\r\nmanifestations apparently unaccompanied by systemic phenomena.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--The earliest writers on medicine bear witness to the fact\r\nthat the disease was recognized at the date when men first made record\r\nof human ailments. It has occurred in all parts of the world and at\r\nall seasons of the year, sparing neither age nor sex in its\r\ndevelopment. Zuelzer[1] refers to epidemic occurrences of the\r\ndisorder, described by Rayer, as visiting the Paris hospitals in 1828;\r\nby Schönlein, as existing in Zürich in 1836; by Gintrac, as spreading\r\nin Bordeaux in 1844-45; and by Trousseau, as prevailing in the\r\nMaternité in Paris in 1858.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cyclop, of the Prac. of Med., Ziemssen_, vol. iv. p.\r\n424.]\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Authors have in general assigned different causes to the\r\nforms of erysipelas hitherto regarded as either idiopathic (or\r\nmedical) or traumatic (or surgical). The modern view, however, is that\r\nwhich regards all cases as alike produced by the absorption of the\r\ntoxic agent capable of exciting this peculiar inflammation of the\r\nskin. The peculiarly well-characterized symptoms of the disease--for\r\nexample, when it affects the head and face--were long regarded as\r\netiologically distinct from the affection which complicates surgical\r\ninjuries and wounds. But {630} a closer study of many of the cases\r\nfirst named has again and again disclosed the fact that they\r\noriginated in such traumatism, for example, as the piercing of the\r\nlobule of the ear for the insertion of an ear-ring, a carious tooth,\r\nan alveolar abscess, or a pathological product in the antrum of\r\nHighmore.\r\n\r\nThe disease is equally common--apart from the puerperal state--in both\r\nsexes and at all ages, and occurs under favorable circumstances in all\r\nseasons of the year. It is unquestionably at times spread by direct\r\ncontagion, either from the living or dead body affected with the\r\ndisease. Such contagion may occur mediately or immediately. It is,\r\nhowever, not readily shown to be producible by the media of clothing\r\nand other articles which have been in contact with a diseased surface.\r\nThe contents of the bullous lesions which appear upon the\r\nerysipelatous surface are inoculable; and the disease has in this way\r\nbeen transferred not only to men, but also, by Orth and others, to the\r\nlower animals, and even from one of the latter to another of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, however, that the disease does occur, characterized by\r\nsymptoms indistinguishable from those to be recognized in the\r\ncontagious type of the malady, where the most careful investigation\r\nwholly fails to reveal the cause, and where the disorder rapidly\r\nspreads if the conditions for its extension are favorable. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is wisest at present to admit that the exact etiology\r\nof erysipelas is unknown. Its relative frequency in the puerperal\r\nstate is unquestionably to be explained by the favorable local\r\nconditions which at such times exist in the female for the development\r\nof all septic disorders.\r\n\r\nAs regards the circumstances which might be supposed to specially\r\nfavor its development, these the capriciousness of the disease, which\r\nis its striking characteristic, often quite disregards. Thus, on the\r\none hand, it may and often does prevail, year after year, in certain\r\nhospitals, and even in certain wards of a single hospital, especially\r\nwhere these are crowded with patients. But it may also repeatedly\r\nspare masses of men affected with disease of a different type when the\r\nlatter are gathered together in prisons or camps, and indeed even may\r\nappear among such individuals and fail to spread to others who are in\r\nclose proximity to them.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the propagation of erysipelas from infected to sound\r\nindividuals, a contrast is exhibited when the transmission of variola,\r\nfor example, is compared with it. Thus, it is well known that the\r\nmildest cases of varioloid may be sources of malignant forms of\r\nvariola to the unprotected, while those who are partially protected\r\nand exposed to the virus of confluent forms of the disease may exhibit\r\nthe mildest symptoms of varioloid. In erysipelas, however, it is\r\ntolerably certain that there are different degrees of virulence to be\r\nrecognized in different cases, and that the disease at times is\r\ntransmitted in its different types. Thus, traumatic erysipelas is much\r\nmore closely related to childbed fever than the varieties of the\r\ndisease appearing upon the head and face, which cannot be attributed\r\nto traumatism, surgical accidents, dental abscesses, or local injuries\r\nof the antrum of Highmore. Parturient women frequently escape\r\ninfection when the erysipelatous disorder is of the so-called medical\r\ntype. Per contra, it is to be noted that women who are prone to the\r\nrelapsing and so-called chronic forms of erysipelas are {631}\r\nparticularly apt to suffer from that involvement of the genital\r\norgans, peritoneum, spleen, and febrile movement whose sudden\r\noccurrence after confinement is so portentous.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The disease is usually announced by the occurrence of\r\na chill, which may precede by a day or but a few hours the appearance\r\nof the cutaneous disorder. The rigor may be severe or mild in grade,\r\nso that it may even be forgotten by the patient till his attention\r\nreverts to it in connection with the resulting symptoms. There may be\r\nsimultaneously some gastric distress, rarely of severe character.\r\nThese symptoms are commonly followed by a febrile reaction. In other\r\ncases the first recognized symptoms of the malady occur in the skin,\r\nthe patient scarcely recalling the fact of a slight preceding malaise.\r\n\r\nThe cutaneous lesions appear in the form of a circumscribed oedema and\r\nredness of the surface, often preceded and usually accompanied by a\r\nsensation of tension, heat, and burning pain. This macule, plaque, or\r\npatch of diseased integument is in its typical features\r\ncharacteristic. It is distinctly or irregularly circumscribed; its\r\noedematous condition elevates its level decidedly above that of the\r\nadjacent integument, so that there is a somewhat sudden descent from\r\nthe former to the latter for a space of from one to two or more lines.\r\nThe redness is also of a bright crimson hue, and the reddened surface\r\nhas a sheen or glossy appearance uniformly displayed over its area. It\r\ndisappears under the pressure of the finger, leaving a yellowish-white\r\ncolor in the region of impact, the erysipelatous blush rapidly\r\nreturning when the circulation at the surface is restored. This smooth\r\nand shining condition of the reddened patch is so characteristic of\r\nerysipelas that it arrests the attention of the diagnostician as soon\r\nas he observes it. According to Zuelzer, it is caused simply by the\r\ntension of the epidermis. When first observed it may occur in the form\r\nof circular, small or large coin-sized patches, or in streaks, striæ,\r\nand radiations, or as very irregularly disposed, rosy, and shining\r\nmarblings or mottlings of an oedematous surface.\r\n\r\nThe skin thus affected is hot to the touch, tender, firm, and smooth.\r\nIt is occasionally the seat of pruritic sensations, more commonly of a\r\npeculiar sensation of heat and burning.\r\n\r\nIn the course of two or three days the involved area spreads uniformly\r\nor irregularly and centrifugally from the point first involved, after\r\nwhich time, in mild cases, the disease persists without apparent\r\nchange for a few days more, prior to its decadence by resolution. This\r\nfinal stage of the malady is characterized by a progressively\r\ndiminishing fever, moderate desquamation, gradual disappearance of the\r\noedema, and a color-change to the darker shades of bluish-red or to a\r\nlight brown. In this form of the disease the erysipelatous patch,\r\nafter being fully developed, does not tend to spread from the affected\r\nto the unaffected surfaces; and, as a consequence, the affection may\r\ncomplete its entire career in less than a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however, a remarkable tendency is developed to the\r\nprogressive spreading of the inflammation from one point or surface of\r\nthe body to another, the parts first affected paling as the disease\r\npasses on to involve those in the vicinity, or being yet deeply\r\ninvolved while the process of peripheral extension is in progress. In\r\nyet other cases the red blush sweeps away from its first position in\r\ntongue-like projections over a {632} tumid and painful skin, while the\r\nregion first invaded becomes paler, though still preserving its\r\noedematous features. In still another class of cases the advancing\r\nribbon or band of elevated and reddened integument passes over to a\r\nnew area, leaving the regions it has traversed tumid, painful, and\r\nhere and there streaked with rosy lines, patches, or irregular\r\ngyrations.\r\n\r\nIn yet severer types of the malady the intensity of the inflammatory\r\nprocess is such that the epidermis is raised from the tissues below by\r\nthe free exudation of the serum of the blood. In this way vesicles,\r\nor, more commonly, bullæ, develop upon the surface. Bullæ thus formed\r\nmay be typically perfect, but are often exceedingly irregular in\r\ncontour, having an appearance which is suggestive of the blistering of\r\na surface by boiling water. The bullæ may be well distended and filled\r\nwith a perfectly limpid serum. This fluid may, however, in the course\r\nof a few days become purulent, the contents in such case drying into\r\ncrusts. In the severest types of the disease gangrene results from the\r\nintensity of the dermatitis, and the loss of tissue which thus occurs\r\nis repaired by the processes of granulation and cicatrization.\r\n\r\nThe migration of erysipelas from one part to another of the surface is\r\nsometimes so extensive as to invade from time to time the larger part\r\nof the superficies of the body. Erysipelas of this ambulant character\r\nmay also, after invading the entire surface of the body, be relighted\r\nat the point where it first appeared. In other cases this phenomenon\r\nof recurrence or reawakening on patches of skin traversed by the\r\ndisease may be noticed only after moderate extension from a given\r\npoint. Reddish or rosy-colored islets then appear as new centres of a\r\nfresh extension-process upon an integument whose swollen tissues still\r\nexhibit the evidences of the prior invasion. In still other cases\r\nsimilar islands of fresh disease are recognized in advance of the\r\nelevated edge and tongue-like prolongations which mark the onward\r\nprogress of the erysipelatous inflammation over areas previously\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nThe swelling of the involved tissues is one of the most characteristic\r\nfeatures of erysipelas. By this is meant not the tumefaction simply of\r\nthe superficial portions of the integument, nor the tumefaction which\r\nmay be measured by the height of the affected above the level of the\r\nunaffected skin at the edge of the involved area, but a swelling much\r\nmore than this, involving the entire skin, and often indeed the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues, differing, of course, in the extent to which it\r\nadvances in different cases. In those of severe grade the swelling is\r\nenormous, an affected limb assuming the elephantiasic aspect, while\r\nthe deformity thus induced in the head is fully as great as that seen\r\nin the height of confluent variola. In such cases the neighboring\r\nganglia are, as a rule, enlarged and often painful.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed this swelling which gives to erysipelas of the head and\r\nface its peculiar physiognomy. The disorder is apt to find its\r\nstarting-point in the ear, the side or point of the nose, or one\r\ncheek. At this moment it may be possible to recognize the fact that\r\nthe adjacent mucous membrane is also involved. Thence the disease\r\nprogresses over the face, and possibly over the scalp also, the\r\nresulting tumefaction being occasionally, as already stated, enormous.\r\nThus the eyes are usually closed and sealed by the swollen lids and\r\nthe orbital depressions are effaced. The lips, enormously pouting and\r\nreddened, project from the swollen visage to as {633} great an extent\r\nas the tumid ears, which, for similar reasons, depart from the usual\r\nplane. The mouth, nares, and eyes alike are covered with mucous\r\nsecretions, possibly commingled with the contents of bullæ which have\r\nformed and broken. Crusts may thus collect near the mucous outlets.\r\nThe tongue is dry, parched, and cracked, and exhibits a reddish-brown\r\nhue. In less severe cases it may be seen to be covered uniformly with\r\na thick yellowish or yellowish-white paste. The fauces and buccal\r\nmembrane are reddish in color, glazed, and dry.\r\n\r\nThe patient having this serious form of the malady is indeed in a\r\ncritical condition. There is usually a coincident coma or delirium.\r\nThe pulse is either greatly accelerated and full, or thready,\r\nfluttering, and destitute of rhythm. The temperature rises to 105° F.,\r\nand even higher. In this condition a fatal issue may be heralded by\r\ncollapse, with decadence of the external evidences of the disease, or\r\nby the occurrence of blood-filled blebs, or indeed by larger or\r\nsmaller areas of the surface falling into gangrene. This latter\r\naccident may also involve the mucous surfaces, large patches of the\r\nbuccal membrane, the gums, and even the palate, losing their vitality\r\nand showing as greenish-black, insensitive tracts, quite firmly\r\nattached to the healthy tissue. These accidents may be of very rapid\r\noccurrence, more particularly in the case of individuals prone to\r\nexhibit the severest forms of the malady, such as very young infants\r\nand those enfeebled by advanced age, by alcoholism, or by any of the\r\ncachexiæ.\r\n\r\nOther types of erysipelas, chiefly noticeable by reason of their\r\nlocation, are those spreading from the umbilicus, the genital region,\r\nthe sites of vaccination, of varices of the lower extremities, and the\r\nsurfaces near the seat of surgical accidents and operations.\r\n\r\nThe various names which have been, especially by older writers, given\r\nto the several expressions of this disorder relate almost exclusively\r\nto their external characteristics. Among these may be mentioned--E.\r\nambulans, e. erythematosum, e. bullosum, e. glabrum, e. levigatum, e.\r\nmiliare, e. oedematosum, e. pemphigoides, e. phlyctenulosum, e.\r\npuerperale, e. vaccinale, e. variegatum, e. verrucosum, and e.\r\nvesiculosum.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of erysipelas in favorably terminating cases is\r\naccomplished by very gradual amelioration of symptoms. The swelling\r\nbegins to subside, usually between the third and sixth days. The blebs\r\nthat have formed then disappear by absorption, bursting, desiccation,\r\nor crusting, and subsequent exfoliation. Desquamation of the involved\r\nsurface may be a prominent or a very insignificant feature. When the\r\npatient with erysipelas capitis enjoys a favorable crisis in his\r\ndisease, there is occasionally noted a very rapid amelioration of the\r\nsymptoms. The tumefaction speedily subsides, the features become\r\nrecognizable, and defervescence is complete. Throughout the course of\r\nall attacks the febrile process and the erysipelatous blush proceed\r\npari passu with but little deviation of the severity of the one from\r\nthe intensity of the other.\r\n\r\nThe complications and sequelæ of the disease are less numerous than\r\nthey are grave. In erysipelas of the head there is usually a rapid\r\nshedding of the hair, though in convalescence the growth of the hair\r\nmay be restored. An obstinate seborrhoea sicca may, as after variola,\r\nlinger long afterward upon the scalp; here also, as in other {634}\r\nportions of the body, one or many abscesses may form in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue after the resolution of the dermatitis; while in\r\nphlegmonous erysipelas these abscesses may accompany the disease at\r\nits height.\r\n\r\nLymphangitis and adenopathy are common complications of erysipelas,\r\nthe former betrayed in thickened and often knotted cords, which may be\r\nfelt radiating from involved areas to neighboring glands. A singular\r\nmodification is often undergone by the integument affected with\r\nerysipelas which has also been the seat of other cutaneous disorders.\r\nIn this way lupus, psoriasis, chronic eczema, and some of the\r\nsyphilodermata have been relieved.\r\n\r\nBesides the surfaces of the nasal, pharyngeal, and buccal mucous\r\nmembranes which have been indicated as at times involved by the\r\ndisease, the inflammatory redness and swelling may extend to the\r\nepiglottis, the larynx, and the trachea. Croupous and other forms of\r\npneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and pleuritis have been not rarely noted.\r\nIn erysipelas of the head the membranes of the brain may inflame and\r\nserous effusions distend the ventricles.\r\n\r\nThe joints may be inflamed either by sympathy or by direct extension\r\nof the erysipelatous inflammation to the periarticular tissues, or yet\r\nby the occurrence, in or about them, of metastatic abscesses in\r\nsepticæmic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum may be also acutely or subacutely inflamed in\r\nerysipelas, though it is doubtful whether the accident occurs in\r\nconsequence of the extension of the disease to this membrane from the\r\nskin of the abdominal wall. The same may be said of the endocarditis\r\nand pericarditis noted by several authors. Of all other complications,\r\nit may be said that they can usually be assigned to the occurrence of\r\neither septicæmia, or pyæmia, or to the development of metastatic\r\nabscesses.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the eyes, a distinction should be drawn between those\r\nattacks originating in deep or superficial affections of the globes\r\nand those in which the visual organs are merely involved as by\r\naccident in the extension of the disease. In the former case deep\r\norbital abscesses or inflammatory affections of the iris and retina\r\nmay be followed by erysipelas of the lids or neighboring parts, while\r\nin the latter event the issue is more commonly a transitory\r\nconjunctivitis, lachrymation, and photophobia, which soon disappear\r\nwhen the disease has declined. The cornea, being unmacerated with pus\r\nas in severe variola, commonly escapes perforation.\r\n\r\nErysipelas is a disorder which, without question, produces in a\r\ncertain proportion of patients a susceptibility to recurrent attacks.\r\nThis susceptibility, however, is less a systemic tendency to the\r\ndevelopment of the disease than a peculiar liability to recrudescence\r\noriginated by chronic local ailments. Thus catarrhal, ulcerative, and\r\nother affections of the nasal mucous membrane are particularly apt to\r\noriginate repeated erysipelatous attacks in the integument covering\r\nthe nose, and the same is true of the skin in the vicinity of the\r\norifices of fistulous sinuses and varicose veins.\r\n\r\nThe forms of disease which are often described as instances of chronic\r\nerysipelas belong to several classes. There are, first, those in which\r\nare observed recurrent attacks of true erysipelas. Second, those in\r\nwhich a chronic eczema or dermatitis produces a circumscribed patch of\r\ninfiltration {635} in a skin having a lurid reddish hue, which is also\r\nthe seat of marked subjective sensations, chiefly itching. The\r\nwell-known forms of chronic eczema erythematosum of the face in middle\r\nyears or advanced life are commonly, and erroneously, regarded as\r\nerysipelatous in character. Third, there is a peculiar dermatitis, of\r\nthe cheeks chiefly, with regard to whose identity as an erysipelatous\r\naffection there is much doubt. The skin is infiltrated in a\r\ncircumscribed patch, and has a peculiarly glossy red hue. It is\r\nessentially a chronic disorder, the affected patch remaining unchanged\r\nfor months at a time, and then exhibiting aggravation in consequence\r\nof accidental exposure to heat or traumatism. These patches may be\r\nrelics of relapsing forms of erysipelas; and in my experience are more\r\ncommonly encountered in the subjects of chronic alcoholism.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The pathological changes exhibited in\r\nthe erysipelatous skin are those of an exudative process involving the\r\ncutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Nothing specially different from\r\nthe phenomena observed in a simple dermatitis can be recognized by the\r\nmicroscope alone. Biesiadecki's careful investigations[2] certainly do\r\nnot disclose any such specificity. The epithelia are swollen with\r\nserous fluid, and the exudate, though largely serous, contains also\r\nthe corpuscles recognized in plastic lymph. It is this serum, rapidly\r\ninvited to the surface by the acuity of the exudative process, which\r\nraises the epidermis into the bullæ described above. The nuclei of the\r\nbodies recognized in the exudate are evidently in a state of division\r\nand consequent multiplication. The epithelia of the rete mucosum are\r\nswollen and stretched. The connective-tissue elements in the derma are\r\nalso swollen, and exhibit reversion to the embryonal state. There is\r\nwithin each a relative increase of protoplasm, as a consequence of\r\nwhich they undergo a species of liquefaction. The blood- and\r\nlymph-vessels enlarge and are crowded with corpuscles. The\r\nsubcutaneous tissue participates in this process, its elements being\r\nfilled with finely granular cells disseminated or in aggregated\r\nmasses. The chief peculiarity of this exudation, and of these changes\r\nin the tissue-elements where it recurs, is the rapidity with which,\r\nwhen involution is in progress, the fluid is absorbed and the\r\ninflammatory elements disappear. When abscess or gangrene complicates\r\nthe erysipelatous inflammation the changes are not different from\r\nthose recognized in dermatitis calorica.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Sitzungsber. d. k. Acad. der Wissen._, Wien, ii., 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe changes noted in the viscera are also of a congestive and\r\ninflammatory type. According to Ponfick,[3] there is at times a\r\nparenchymatous degeneration of the muscular tissues of the large\r\nvessels, and of the extremities, as well as of the kidneys, liver, and\r\nspleen, the latter organ occasionally undergoing softening. The mucous\r\nsurfaces of the mouth, larynx, lungs, and alimentary canal have also\r\nbeen found affected with oedema, congestion, and infiltration, rarely\r\nterminating in ulcerative changes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Deutsch. klin._, No. 20, 1868.]\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of a typical case of erysipelas is so simple\r\nthat the nature of the malady is often recognized by those unskilled\r\nin such matters. It is difficult to mistake for any other affection\r\nthe circumscribed, swollen, shining, and rosy-reddish patch of skin,\r\naccompanied by fever or marked malaise, with adenopathy of near\r\nglands, and often with a history of traumatism to which the origin of\r\nthe disorder may be readily referred.\r\n\r\n{636} It is to be distinguished from dermatitis in its various forms\r\n(venenata, medicamentosa, phlegmonosa, suppurativa) by its\r\ncharacteristic features, and by the frequent absence in these\r\ninflammations of a febrile reaction and of a shining, rosy-red hue of\r\nthe skin, and by the peculiarities described above of the elevated\r\nmargin of the erysipelatous area.\r\n\r\nEczema, especially in its chronic erythematous forms, exhibited in the\r\nface of adults in middle and later life, is of much slower\r\ndevelopment, is productive of itching, is ill-defined in contour, and\r\nis not accompanied by fever.\r\n\r\nErythema in all its varieties is a purely hyperæmic affection and\r\nunaccompanied by fever. In erythema multiforme there is an exudative\r\nprocess by reason of which various papules, nodosities, and at times\r\neven bullæ, appear upon the surface. None of them, however, are\r\naccompanied by a diffused area of redness spreading at the periphery.\r\nAll of its lesions are circumscribed, and rarely affect the face.\r\n\r\nPemphigus could only be mistaken for the form of erysipelas bullæ, but\r\nits lesions do not rise from a broadly inflamed area; they rather have\r\nattended with each a distinct individual halo when the integument from\r\nwhich they spring is at all congested. They are also rarely\r\naccompanied by a febrile process.\r\n\r\nScarlatina, though a febrile affection, is readily distinguished from\r\nerysipelas by the appearance of its exanthem, symmetrically and\r\ngenerally developed over the entire surface of the body, or\r\nprogressively and symmetrically from the upper to the lower segment of\r\nit. The exanthem has also a dull scarlet color or the boiled lobster\r\nhue, differing thus from the rosy-red and shining patch of erysipelas.\r\n\r\nUrticaria also is often of symmetrical development, is rarely\r\naccompanied by fever, and is characterized by typical wheals, which,\r\nhowever closely packed together, never have the smoothness of the\r\nsurface affected with erysipelas.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of a simple case of uncomplicated erysipelas\r\noccurring in an individual in fair health and possessed of a\r\nreasonable degree of vigor may be regarded as favorable. Even in the\r\nweakness of infancy a large area may be involved in the disease and a\r\nhigh degree of fever be aroused without alarming results.\r\n\r\nErysipelas should, however, always be regarded as a serious disease or\r\na serious complication of any existing malady. It is often a grave\r\nfeature in surgical injuries. Erysipelas involving the entire surface\r\nof the face and head is always a formidable affection. In the\r\npuerperal state it is dreaded by every accoucheur.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances are rendered more portentous by the existence\r\nof the disorder as a complication of any other grave malady, or by its\r\noccurrence among the subjects of alcoholism, struma, phthisis, or\r\nvarious other cachexias, and among the aged. Occurring in epidemic\r\nform among the inmates of prisons, camps, and hospitals, the mortality\r\nof the disease may be increased tenfold.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--The prophylaxis of erysipelas is that of all contagious\r\ndiseases. It involves isolation of the affected individual,\r\ndisinfection of body- and bed-clothing before the latter are again\r\nemployed upon the persons of others, and destruction by fire of all\r\ndressings which have been in contact with the integument.\r\n\r\n{637} The hygienic management of the patient is not to be neglected.\r\nThe complete ventilation of the sick chamber is to be secured, and its\r\ntemperature uniformly sustained at a point between 65° and 70° F.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment of the sufferer need not greatly differ from\r\nthat commonly pursued in the febrile state by modern therapeutists.\r\nThere is but little confidence to-day in the methods by venesection\r\nand purgation, upon which at one time reliance was placed. Cool or\r\ncold water may be freely employed when there is hyperpyrexia, either\r\nby general bathing or by wrapping the patient in sheets dipped in and\r\nwrung out of the same fluid. The results are favorable as regards the\r\nbodily temperature, and are not productive of danger, though water\r\nthus applied has no effect upon the local disorder of the skin. Iced\r\nor cool water, by the ice-bag or compresses, is specially indicated as\r\na topical application for the head when there is delirium or other\r\nindication of disturbance of the cephalic centres, irrespective of the\r\ninvasion of the scalp and face by the erysipelatous inflammation. The\r\nsulphate of quinia in full doses is indicated especially when there is\r\nany tendency to remittence in the febrile accessions, but is not known\r\nto possess any power to cut short the disease. In many cases of\r\nerysipelas the febrile condition is readily managed by the\r\nadministration of the simpler remedies found grateful to the palate of\r\nthe sufferer, such as iced, acidulated, and effervescing draughts,\r\nwith perhaps the employment of the spiritus Mindereri or the spirit of\r\nnitrous ether. In other cases the mineral acids can be substituted\r\nwith advantage for the latter. With many American physicians it is\r\ncustomary to add to these remedies the tincture of the root of\r\naconite, with a view to its effect upon the pulse.\r\n\r\nFew internal remedies, however, have in this country enjoyed as much\r\npopularity with the profession in the treatment of erysipelas as the\r\nmuriated tincture of iron in full doses. Its use, first suggested for\r\nthis purpose by Bell in 1851, has here steadily gained in favor since\r\nits general adoption. It is well to give it in doses of not less than\r\n20 or 30 drops, repeated every two or three hours, diluted with water.\r\nWhen there is high fever, and especially if the secretion of urine is\r\nscanty, the following formula will be found valuable:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Tr. Ferri Chloridi;\r\n      Sp. Ætheris Nitrosi;\r\n      Glycerinæ      _aa._ fl. drachm i. M.\r\n\r\nS. A teaspoonful in water every three hours.\r\n\r\nThis preparation of iron certainly seems, in many cases, to shorten\r\nthe disease, but, per contra, it is to be remembered--first, that in\r\nmany other cases it has been found to exercise no control whatever\r\nover the severest manifestations of the disease; second, that in other\r\ncountries, especially in Germany, where it is rarely employed, the\r\nmortality from the disease is no greater than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe widest difference in practice has obtained relative to the local\r\ntreatment of the affection. They who have had the fortitude to content\r\nthemselves with watching the evolution of the specific dermatitis,\r\nmerely protecting the skin by dusting over it a simple powder or\r\nleaving it covered with a cold compress, have certainly no worse\r\nresults to tabulate than those who entertain a belief in the efficacy\r\nof the abortive treatment of the local disorder.\r\n\r\n{638} No remedies, locally applied, can be recognized as certainly\r\npossessing the power to cut short the inflammation. Those which enjoy\r\nthe highest reputation for topical employment are saturated solutions,\r\nhot and cold, of the hyposulphite of sodium, of boracic acid, and of\r\nthe bicarbonate of sodium; salicylic acid; iodoform in powder; and,\r\nquite lately, resorcin. Hot fomentations of the erysipelatous patch\r\nare in general most grateful to the patient, and with these an opiate\r\nand astringent effect can be obtained, as by a hot lead and opium wash\r\nor by solutions of the sulphate of iron or of alum and tannin. Useful\r\nmethods of applying these are by the medium of borated cotton, oakum,\r\ntow, or spongiopiline, covered with oiled silk or the Lister\r\nprotective material.\r\n\r\nOther medicaments which have enjoyed favor in the topical treatment of\r\nthe disease are lime-water and linseed oil (carron oil), sulphur in\r\npowder, carbolic acid, camphor, the oil of turpentine, collodium,\r\ncataplasms and ointments containing mercury, lead, zinc, tar, and\r\ntannin.\r\n\r\nRespecting the measures adopted with a view to checking the extension\r\nof the disease at the periphery of the patch, the belief in such a\r\npossibility has been wellnigh abandoned. For this purpose the nitrate\r\nof silver, caustic potash, tincture of iodine, and similar substances\r\nhave been boldly and broadly applied, alike over the sound and\r\naffected integument, with the production of an artificial dermatitis\r\nintended to supplant that which was previously in progress. Again and\r\nagain has the local inflammation transgressed these artificial limits;\r\nand when they have been by it apparently respected there has been\r\nlittle ground for believing that the result was due to the treatment\r\npursued. Inasmuch as the disease is often self-limited and distinctly\r\nlimited in its progression over the surface, it is manifestly\r\ndifficult to determine that its limitation in any given case is the\r\nresult of topical agencies. These agencies have, moreover, the marked\r\ndisadvantage of adding their irritative effects to those incidental to\r\nthe dermatitis.\r\n\r\nThe surgical treatment of erysipelas invading special regions of the\r\nbody or the deeper tissues is a matter of importance. Free incisions\r\nare requisite for the liberation of pus, and all abscess cavities\r\nshould be treated antiseptically and stuffed with iodoform or\r\nresorcin. Great tension of the lids demands free incisions in the long\r\ndiameter of either, and the same surgical procedures are often\r\ndemanded in erysipelas of the scrotum or of the labia in the female.\r\nGangrene and sloughing are to be treated in accordance with the\r\nprinciples recognized as important in the management of these\r\naccidents in general.\r\n\r\nThe mouth when involved may be benefited by gargles containing the\r\nchlorate of potassium, alum, tannin, the compound tincture of\r\ncinchona, or by the use of the spray with a saturated solution of\r\nboracic acid in rosewater. Kaposi lays stress, in all cases of\r\nerysipelas of the face, upon the importance of searching for and\r\nevacuating all dental abscesses and pustules seated upon the\r\nSchneiderian membrane. Crusts in the nasal cavity are to be soaked\r\nwith vaseline and removed by washing, their re-formation being\r\nprevented by the insertion of small tampons smeared with a bland\r\nointment or oily fluid. Abscesses in other portions of the body, not\r\nsuspected as being etiologically significant, are to be carefully\r\nsearched for and emptied, whether occurring about the anus, the\r\ngenitals, or the legs.\r\n\r\n{639} Subcutaneous injections of carbolic acid and other antiseptic\r\nsolutions have not been rewarded by such results as to establish in\r\nany degree their special efficacy.\r\n\r\nIn all ordinary cases the expectant treatment recommended by Zuelzer\r\nis abundantly to be commended. The inflamed tissue is to be dusted\r\nwith finely-powdered starch, and protected by a layer of soft\r\ncotton-wool which exercises a moderate degree of pressure upon it.\r\nAntiseptically, the highest ends are thus reached.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the patient should consist of animal broths, soups, milk,\r\nand eggs, with a view to the reparation of the waste incidental to the\r\nfebrile process. Stimulants are to be freely used in all asthenic\r\nconditions. In convalescence the warm water and soap bath is to be\r\nemployed, followed by dusting of the surface with starch powder or by\r\ninunction with vaseline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{640}\r\n\r\nYELLOW FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY S. M. BEMISS, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nYellow fever is a specific, infectious, and communicable disease of\r\none febrile paroxysm.\r\n\r\nThis definition includes some of the most prominent characteristics of\r\nthe disease. The malady, however, derives its name from a symptom not\r\nmentioned in the definition. The yellow color of the skin and\r\nscleroticæ which appears in advanced stages of grave cases of yellow\r\nfever, and which becomes especially marked in the cadaver, has ruled\r\nits nomenclature. Whatever objections may be urged against the term\r\n\"yellow fever\" as being founded upon a symptom of the disease not\r\nalways present, it is too strongly fixed in both medical literature\r\nand popular usage to justify efforts to change it.\r\n\r\nNeither is it liable to beget confusion as long as it is understood\r\nthat it is to be restricted in its application to a specific fever\r\ninduced by a specific poison, and that as an incident of its morbid\r\nprocess it produces yellow coloration of the surface so frequently as\r\nto suggest the prefix yellow to its title.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--In this day of almost general belief in\r\nthe theory which holds that each specific disease has its own specific\r\npoison or morbific germ, it is scarcely expedient to occupy much space\r\nin discussing the propriety of classing yellow fever among the\r\nspecific maladies.\r\n\r\nWhether we rest the decision of this question upon the uniformity of\r\nthose circumstances and conditions which originate and develop\r\nepidemics of yellow fever, or upon the sameness of its symptomatic\r\nphenomena wherever observed, we find very nearly as substantial claims\r\nto a specific individualization of the disease as any one of the\r\neruptive fevers possesses. Not only are its morbid phenomena so\r\ncharacteristic that even non-professional observers designate it by\r\nsuch epithets as Bronze John, Yellow Jack, Vomito Prieto, etc., but it\r\nis inconvertible with other specific affections. This inconvertibility\r\nof yellow fever with other diseases is absolute, and affords\r\nirrefrangible evidence of the specificity of that germ or poisonous\r\nprinciple which produces it.\r\n\r\nThe study of yellow-fever poison after the objective method has\r\nhitherto been unproductive of definite results. When such experienced\r\nand truthful observers as Sternberg, Woodward, and Schmidt, working\r\nwith the most approved microscopes, have failed to identify any\r\norganism or object peculiar to the products from the bodies of\r\nyellow-fever subjects or to the circumfusa of the sick, this\r\ndeclaration is sufficiently supported.\r\n\r\n{641} But when we turn to a subjective method of investigating that\r\ntoxic agent which causes yellow fever, it is found to possess\r\nsufficiently well-marked characteristics to justify practically\r\nvaluable conclusions. Some of these characteristics or modes of\r\nbehavior merit notice.\r\n\r\n1st. The human system is a field of reproduction and multiplication of\r\nyellow-fever poison. This is sufficiently established by two facts:\r\n\r\n(_a_) A person in the incubative stage of yellow-fever intoxication\r\nmay be divested of all fomites and yet originate other cases after a\r\ndeveloped attack.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The infection is intensified by aggregation of the sick.\r\n\r\nThese propositions are indisputably true.\r\n\r\n2d. The poison or infection undergoes some change after leaving the\r\nhuman system. This appears to be susceptible of proof, because\r\ncommunication of the disease from person to person is not a common\r\nevent. When this does apparently occur, there is often very strong\r\nreason for a belief that the contagion was resident in some fomites\r\nconnected with the patient's bed or clothing.\r\n\r\n3d. There are no sustained observations which prove that yellow-fever\r\npoison is ever created de novo.\r\n\r\nThe autochthonous birthplace of the poison is unknown. The suggestion\r\nof Niebuhr, that yellow fever may have been one of the causes of death\r\nduring the plagues of Athens, can not be authoritatively denied. It\r\nmay have been called into existence at the moment when all things else\r\nwere created which were to perpetuate each its kind.\r\n\r\n4th. Some of those conditions and circumstances which favor or retard\r\nthe development or maturation of yellow-fever poison outside the human\r\nbody are quite well understood. Warm, damp weather is most prominent\r\namong those climatic conditions which are favorable to the growth of\r\nyellow-fever epidemics.\r\n\r\n5th. A freezing temperature ordinarily destroys the contagium of\r\nyellow fever. A high degree of artificial heat produces a similar\r\nresult. It is highly probable that certain chemical agents would also\r\neffect its destruction if brought in contact with it.\r\n\r\n6th. If yellow-fever fomites are hermetically enclosed in situations\r\nprotected from cold or other agents which are destructive to their\r\ninfection, its vitality may be preserved for an undetermined length of\r\ntime, and its toxic qualities again made manifest when unacclimated\r\npersons are exposed to it.\r\n\r\n7th. Yellow-fever poison possesses ponderability. This characteristic\r\nis so distinctly marked that it has been frequently termed a\r\n\"low-lying poison.\"\r\n\r\n8th. It is incapable of being air-borne through any great distance, at\r\nleast without being deprived of its toxic effects.\r\n\r\n9th. It is transportable in fomites through great distances, either on\r\nsea or land, and as often as its toxic effects are manifested after\r\nthese portations they are so uniform as to be promptly recognizable.\r\n\r\nA great number of different materials in common use may act as\r\nfomites, such as loose wool, cotton, or hair, or textile fabrics of\r\nvarious descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe following facts, which illustrate how yellow-fever infection may\r\nbe conveyed in the most unsuspecting and innocent manner, are well\r\n{642} authenticated. There can be no ground for accusation of error\r\nexcept in the hypothesis that the infection was encountered\r\nsimultaneously in some unexplained manner. The facts are furnished by\r\nDr. Shannon of Ocean Springs, Mississippi: \"On the 14th of October,\r\n1883, Maj. J. B. B. died of yellow fever in Ocean Springs, Miss. I\r\nmoved the family at once to the healthy locality where you saw Miss\r\nB., not allowing them to take any article from the room where the\r\nhusband and father had died. The children applied to me for a lock of\r\ntheir father's hair, which I refused, but the oldest daughter, now\r\ndead, prevailed upon the nurse to give it her. She placed it in an old\r\nenvelope that had been torn open at the end and carefully folded the\r\ntorn end down, thus practically sealing it, and laid it away among\r\nother old letters. On Sunday, the 4th of November, at 12.30 P.M., she\r\nbrought this envelope out upon the open gallery, and opened it for the\r\nfirst time to examine the lock of hair and show it to her aunt, Miss\r\nS., who was visiting her, and upon inhaling the concentrated poison\r\nconfined in the envelope and emanating from the hair, exclaimed, 'Oh,\r\nwhat a peculiar smell!' She then handed the envelope to her aunt, Miss\r\nS., who, unconscious of danger, also inhaled the 'messenger of death'\r\nwith a similar exclamation, when Mrs. B., who was standing near,\r\nreached out her hand for the envelope, but was prevented from getting\r\nit by the entreaties of a fretful child to be taken up in her arms.\r\nThis gave time for sufficient reflection, and she admonished the young\r\nladies of the possible danger. The envelope was then carefully folded,\r\nand with its fatal contents replaced in the drawer where it had been\r\nsince the 14th of October. This drawer had been almost daily opened.\r\nOn the following Saturday night, Nov. 10th, at 9 P.M., Miss S. was\r\ntaken sick with a chill, and Miss B. at about 2 A.M., some five hours\r\nlater, the period of incubation being less than seven days in both\r\ncases. No other person handled the fatal envelope or in any way came\r\nin contact with it, and there is, after the most careful inquiry, no\r\nsuspicion of any other source of infection in these two cases. Miss S.\r\ndied on Oct. 14th, Miss B. on Oct. 16th.\"\r\n\r\n10th. These qualities of yellow-fever infection, and especially its\r\nfaculty of reproduction (which only organisms possess), furnish almost\r\nconclusive evidence that yellow fever is a germ disease produced by a\r\nspecific contagium vivum.\r\n\r\nMany facts are patent which sustain the generally accepted opinion\r\nthat yellow-fever poison gains admission to the system through the\r\nmedium of atmospheric air. On the other hand, I know of no\r\nobservations which prove that the disease is ever communicated by food\r\nor drinks, or through any other vehicle than atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIn respect to atmospheric infection by yellow fever, localizations of\r\naërial impregnation are often observable, not common in other\r\nair-infecting diseases. A certain district of a large and populous\r\ncity may become the seat of a sweeping and fatal epidemic, and yet no\r\ncase occur outside of this area of prevalence. It is customary to\r\nspeak of these points of epidemic prevalence as infected localities.\r\nIf unprotected persons visit such infected places, even for a short\r\nperiod of time, they are liable to attacks of yellow fever, although\r\nthey may take neither food nor drink within the limits of infection\r\nand bring no fomites away with them. Under these circumstances\r\natmospheric impregnation is conclusive.\r\n\r\n{643} But it is difficult to determine how this infection of a\r\nlocality has been produced in the first place, and how, in the second\r\nplace, it is maintained sometimes for periods of from one to three\r\nmonths, with so little apparent diminution or change in the liability\r\nto communicate yellow fever to unprotected visitors within the limits\r\nof infection.\r\n\r\nIt seems highly probable that yellow-fever poison, after its exit from\r\nthe human body, attaches itself to various solid surfaces in proximity\r\nto the sick, where, under suitable climatic conditions, it undergoes\r\nmore or less speedy processes of maturation in toxic qualities. The\r\npoison thus matured is capable of being preserved with but little\r\nchange for the periods indicated above, and is communicable through\r\nthe atmosphere for short distances. It is also capable, by virtue of\r\nsome unexplained process or quality, of spontaneously extending its\r\narea of infection. But this is at all times slow, and is readily\r\ninterrupted by streams of water, high walls, or even by much-travelled\r\nthoroughfares.\r\n\r\nThere are no instances in which the water-supply of cities has been\r\nshown to have distributed yellow fever.\r\n\r\nThe periods of time which may intervene between exposure to\r\nyellow-fever poison and attacks of the disease are extremely variable.\r\nThe shortest period of incubation which has come under my observation\r\nwas about twenty hours. In three cases in which I was able to fix the\r\nhours of first exposure with precision attacks followed in 72 hours,\r\n83 hours, and 101 hours, respectively. Of 55 unacclimated physicians\r\nwho exposed themselves at Memphis during the epidemic of 1878, 54\r\nsuffered attacks of yellow fever. In these cases the periods of\r\nincubation varied from one to twenty-five days, the average duration\r\nbeing ten days. These physicians all remained steadfastly at their\r\nposts of duty; consequently, the attack which occurred on the\r\ntwenty-fifth day was postponed for that length of time during constant\r\nexposure in a locality most intensely infected.\r\n\r\nIt must be true that many cases of individual resistance to the\r\neffects of yellow-fever infection depend upon states of the system or\r\nidiosyncrasies which diminish liability to the action of the poison.\r\nIn other words, their personal receptivity to it is lessened by\r\ncertain constitutional states.\r\n\r\nThat this position is correctly taken is proved by the fact that many\r\ncircumstances which violently disturb the system determine attacks in\r\npersons who may have for a long time enjoyed immunity from them.\r\nAnxiety, grief, fright, fatigue, or exposure to sudden wettings or\r\ncold may precipitate attacks, either by disturbing vital processes by\r\nwhich the system is ridding itself of the poison--so far, at least, as\r\nto prevent an accumulation great enough to occasion attacks--or by\r\nlowering powers of resistance through enfeeblement of nerve-force.\r\n\r\nBut it can be affirmed in regard to yellow-fever poison that it is not\r\nmore capricious or eccentric in its behavior as an infection than that\r\nof scarlet fever. Each of these diseases may appear in a large family\r\nof unprotected persons with a degree of violence which results in\r\ndeath in every instance, and suddenly cease, leaving a greater or less\r\nnumber of the household without attacks, though equally exposed with\r\nthose who have died.\r\n\r\nOne attack of yellow fever confers immunity from the disease during\r\nafter life. A person who has suffered an attack is said to be\r\nacclimated {644} or protected. Neither of these terms should be\r\napplied to those who have not suffered attacks, however long they may\r\nhave withstood exposure during epidemics. It often occurs that persons\r\nwho have escaped attacks through many years of renewed exposure at\r\nlast succumb to the disease. On the other hand, I know of three\r\nwell-authenticated instances of immunity in a sweeping epidemic of\r\npersons whose mothers had suffered attacks during the gestations which\r\nrespectively resulted in their births.\r\n\r\nWhile negroes are susceptible to yellow-fever infection, attacks are\r\nfar less fatal than among whites.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS IN MILD OR SIMPLE CASES.--Yellow fever is usually sudden in\r\nits onset. Persons are liable to be seized while pursuing their\r\nordinary avocations, or, as often occurs, the attack may begin during\r\nthe night. The initial symptoms are chilliness or cold sensations,\r\nseldom amounting to a decided rigor. Reaction is usually prompt and\r\ndecided, the temperature reaching within a few hours 102° to 105° F.\r\nYellow fever is not a disease in which it is very common to observe\r\nexcessive body heat.\r\n\r\nAs the fever is established, the countenance becomes flushed and the\r\neyes injected and glistening. Frontal headache and lumbar pain are\r\nexperienced very early in the attack, and are liable to become more\r\nintense during the progress of the fever. Muscular neuralgias,\r\nespecially in the lower extremities, are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nDuring the early period of the attack the tongue is indifferent as a\r\nsymptom. It is generally moist and free from any coating. In cases\r\nattended by much furring of the tongue careful investigation is pretty\r\nsure to disclose the fact that it has been brought about by some\r\npre-existing state of disease.\r\n\r\nThe bowels are generally inactive, though naturally impressible to\r\ncathartic drugs. The stomach is querulous from the inception of the\r\nattack to its conclusion. Vomiting may not occur spontaneously, but it\r\nis easily provoked by repletion of the stomach with any description of\r\ningesta or by harsh or disgusting medicines. The acts of emesis are\r\nsudden and short in duration. Bile is a very uncommon constituent of\r\nthe matters ejected. Whether vomiting has occurred or not, patients\r\nnearly always express repugnance to the weight of the physician's hand\r\nover the epigastrium. In the very mildest cases it seems to excite\r\ngastric distress and a tendency to emesis. The stomach and bowels are\r\nliable to distension by flatus, sometimes to the extent of producing\r\ncolicky pains. Gaseous eructations are common.\r\n\r\nDuring and shortly succeeding the cold stage the urine may be somewhat\r\nincreased in amount, but after the fever is established both the\r\nquantity and the specific gravity are notably lessened. Albumen seldom\r\nappears in the urine during the first twenty-four hours of an attack.\r\nIn very mild cases it is altogether absent throughout.\r\n\r\nDelirium is not unusual during the fever. Among children attacks are\r\noften ushered in by convulsions. In such cases delirium may be\r\npersistent and alarming in violence.\r\n\r\nThe pulse in the early stage of yellow fever is slower in proportion\r\nto the temperature than in most other acute diseases. This is more\r\nespecially true in respect to mild cases. Another characteristic\r\nfeature of the pulse in {645} yellow fever is that it declines in\r\nfrequency before the fever has reached its maximum. In the mildest\r\nforms of the disease the temperature will attain its highest record\r\nwithin twelve hours. It then rapidly defervesces, never to return\r\nagain. But in some cases of a moderately mild form the body heat does\r\nnot reach its acme of intensity until the second day, occasionally not\r\nuntil the third or fourth day. In these cases also the pulse is apt to\r\ndecline in frequency before the fever has culminated. There are\r\ntherefore no fixed laws which govern the duration of the hot stage of\r\nyellow fever. Those which relate to the pulse are more uniform.\r\n\r\nThe following clinical reports of two cases support this statement.\r\nThe detailed account of the symptoms establishing their diagnosis as\r\nmild cases of yellow fever is omitted.\r\n\r\nSusie W----, white, aged seventeen years, was admitted to Charity\r\nHospital on August 28, 1878. First observation, nine hours after the\r\nbeginning of the attack, pulse 100, temperature 104.6°. Morning of\r\n29th, pulse 94, temperature 102.8°; evening, pulse 80, temperature\r\n101.5°. Sanguineous discharge from vagina began on 29th; patient\r\nsupposed it to be her proper period. Aug. 30th, pulse 80, temperature\r\n99.2°; convalescent and dismissed from further observations. In this\r\ncase the urine presented a trace of albumen early on the second day,\r\nbut as the menses appeared shortly after the urine was obtained, the\r\npresence of albumen may be in that manner accounted for.\r\n\r\nBessie L----, white, age twenty-seven years, admitted to Charity\r\nHospital on August 28, 1878. First observation, twelve hours after\r\nbeginning of attack, pulse 100, temperature 100.6°. 29th, pulse 76,\r\ntemperature 102.3°. 30th, pulse 64, temperature 101.5°. Sanguineous\r\ndischarge from vagina began on 30th and continued until Sept. 4th;\r\nthis was two weeks before the patient's regular period. The urine\r\nshowed traces of albumen at date of admission. Discharged, cured, Aug.\r\n31st.\r\n\r\nIt may also be stated of the pulse of yellow fever that it is easily\r\ncompressible and often gaseous in character.\r\n\r\nPerspiration is probably an incident in the natural clinical history\r\nof a case of yellow fever. It occurs spontaneously if the patient's\r\nsurface is protected from those influences which conflict with its\r\nappearance. It is not critical in any sense of the word, and may\r\ncoexist with high temperature.\r\n\r\nYellow fever is considered to have two clinical stages. The first is\r\nthe paroxysm. This is made to include the cold stage and succeeding\r\nfever. The cold stage is often almost or quite inappreciable, and when\r\nthis is not the fact it is in simple cases a very unimportant event.\r\nIt is therefore quite convenient to include it with the fever under\r\nthe term paroxysm. The paroxysm of a simple case is terminated by a\r\nsubsidence of the fever to nearly or quite a normal temperature.\r\nSometimes the temperature falls below the normal standard.\r\n\r\nThe neuralgias and subjective sufferings are greatly mitigated or\r\ncease altogether. Thirst and restlessness are relieved, and the\r\npatient sees before him a delicious, but too often treacherous, mirage\r\nof restoration to perfect health. This is termed the stage of calm,\r\nperhaps because it often precedes a tempest of fatal symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn mild cases convalescence begins at the termination of the paroxysm,\r\nand may proceed without interruption until complete re-establishment\r\nof {646} health has been accomplished. But in the very mildest cases\r\nthe process of recovery is easily interrupted.\r\n\r\nIn these simple forms the tendency to hemorrhage first manifests\r\nitself in the calm stage. The gums become red, tumid, and spongy, the\r\ntongue pointed and red at the tip. Epistaxis is liable to occur. The\r\neyes and skin may be slightly yellow, and the urine may show traces of\r\nalbumen. However mild the other symptoms may appear, the tendency to\r\nhemorrhage, to albuminous urine, and to jaundice in the calm stage\r\nbears a direct relation in frequency of occurrence and in degree to\r\nthe blood-stasis, or sluggish capillary circulation, of the first\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a recital of the clinical phenomena of typical and\r\nsimple forms of yellow fever. The departures from type have been\r\ndivided by different writers into a variety of forms. The most\r\nimportant of these will be referred to in connection with suggestions\r\nas to treatment.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--Prognosis is variable in different epidemics, this\r\nobservation being understood to apply to the same localities. Some of\r\nthose circumstances which affect epidemic force, so as to increase the\r\nmortality-rate, are appreciable. If an epidemic invades a population\r\nafter an interval of exemption sufficiently long to allow a large\r\nnumber of unprotected persons to have accumulated in its midst, the\r\ncrowding of the sick will increase the death-rate. We may naturally\r\nassume that this is attributable, first, to sheer multiplication of\r\nthe infection; second, to lack of proper attention to the sick, and to\r\nfright, grief, exhaustion, etc.\r\n\r\n_Tabulated Abstract of Practice in Yellow-Fever Epidemic of 1878, New\r\nOrleans Charity Hospital._\r\n\r\n\r\n  ---------+---------+-----------+-----------+---------+-----------+-----\r\n    AGES.  |  July.  |   August. | September.| October.|   Total.  |\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n           | N  | N  |  N  |  N  |  N  |  N  | N  | N  |  N  |  N  |  P\r\n           | o  | o  |  o  |  o  |  o  |  o  | o  | o  |  o  |  o  |  e\r\n           | .  | .  |  .  |  .  |  .  |  .  | .  | .  |  .  |  .  |  r\r\n           |    |    |     |     |     |     |    |    |     |     |\r\n           | t  | f  |  t  |  f  |  t  |  f  | t  | f  |  t  |  f  |  c\r\n           | r  | a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  | r  | a  |  r  |  a  |  e\r\n           | e  | t  |  e  |  t  |  e  |  t  | e  | t  |  e  |  t  |  n\r\n           | a  | a  |  a  |  a  |  a  |  a  | a  | a  |  a  |  a  |  t\r\n           | t  | l  |  t  |  l  |  t  |  l  | t  | l  |  t  |  l  |  .\r\n           | e  | .  |  e  |  .  |  e  |  .  | e  | .  |  e  |  .  |\r\n    White. | d  |    |  d  |     |  d  |     | d  |    |  d  |     |\r\n           | .  |    |  .  |     |  .  |     | .  |    |  .  |     |\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n   Under 5 | .. | .. |   7 |   3 |   3 |   1 | .. | .. |  10 |   4 | 40.0\r\n   5 to 10 | .. | .. |   2 |   1 |   1 |   1 | .. | .. |   3 |   2 | 66.66\r\n  10 to 20 |  8 |  3 |  26 |   7 |  25 |   6 |  7 | .. |  66 |  16 | 24.2\r\n  20 to 40 | 18 |  9 | 246 | 141 | 175 |  91 | 61 | 24 | 500 | 265 | 53.0\r\n  40 to 60 |  9 |  6 |  75 |  45 |  83 |  45 | 18 | 10 | 185 | 106 | 57.3\r\n  60 to 80 |  2 |  2 |   7 |   6 |   5 |   1 |  1 |  1 |  15 |  10 | 66.66\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n    Total. | 37 | 20 | 363 | 203 | 292 | 145 | 87 | 35 | 779 | 403 | 51.7\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n    Black. |    |    |     |     |     |     |    |    |     |     |\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n  10 to 20 | .. | .. |   2 | ... |   5 | ... |  1 | .. |   8 | ... |  ...\r\n  20 to 40 | .. | .. |  11 |   3 |   8 |   1 |  5 |  1 |  24 |   5 | 20.8\r\n  40 to 60 | .. | .. |   2 |   1 |   1 |   1 |  3 |  1 |   6 |   3 | 50.0\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n    Total. | .. | .. |  15 |   4 |  14 |   2 |  9 |  2 |  38 |   8 | 21.0\r\n  ---------+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+-----+-----+------\r\n       Grand total.                                    | 817 | 411 | 50.3\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------+-----+-----+------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{647} Prognosis is especially bad in hospital practice. The foregoing\r\nstatistics of cases admitted to the Charity Hospital of New Orleans\r\nduring the greater part of the epidemic of 1878 illustrate the usual\r\nresults of hospital practice.\r\n\r\nMany of these patients were conveyed to the hospital in extreme\r\nconditions; occasionally they were moribund on admission. It is\r\nhazardous to the life of a yellow-fever patient to transfer him over\r\nthe rough streets of a city, often for two or three miles, unless this\r\nis done in the very earliest hours of the attack.\r\n\r\nPrognosis is seriously influenced by the condition of the patient at\r\nthe moment of attack. If pregnancy exists or delivery has just\r\noccurred, it is, under most circumstances, extremely unfavorable.\r\nFatigue, anxiety, despair, or grief, all render prognosis more gloomy.\r\n\r\nThe march of temperature is also important in determining fatal\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics show the influence of temperature in relation\r\nto mortality from yellow fever:\r\n\r\n       |First|     |Second|     |Third|     |Fourth|     |Fifth|\r\n       | day.|Died.| day. |Died.| day.|Died.| day. |Died.| day.|Died.\r\n  -----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----\r\n  106° | ... | ... |   3  |   2 |   1 |   1 |   2  |   2 | ... | ...\r\n  105° |   9 |   3 |   5  |   4 |   2 |   5 |   2  |   2 |   2 |   2\r\n  104° |  18 |  10 |  23  |  13 |   8 |   3 |   2  |   2 |   3 |   2\r\n  103° |  14 |   4 |  11  |   8 |   2 |   2 |   3  |   1 |   2 | ...\r\n  -----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this table that the danger line of temperature in\r\nyellow fever descends as the case progresses.\r\n\r\nIt may again be stated that yellow fever, like scarlet fever, exhibits\r\nsuch striking contrasts in its mortality-rate that it is hardly\r\npossible to assert any average standard. It is true that in this\r\ndisease, as in all others, statistical accumulations tend to correct\r\ntheir own errors in exact proportion to the magnitude of the\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 some 36,000 cases occurred in Louisiana, of which number not\r\nless than 6000 were fatal, a percentage of 16.66. The results of\r\nprivate practice in New Orleans are exhibited in the following\r\nstatistics: Four of the principal practitioners in the city treated in\r\nprivate practice 975 patients--909 white and 66 colored. Of the\r\nformer, 92, or 10.11 per cent., died; of the colored only 2 died. The\r\ncases and deaths among the whites, classified by age, were as follows:\r\n\r\n              AGE.           |  Cases. |  Deaths. | Per Cent.\r\n  ---------------------------+---------+----------|----------\r\n  Under 5 years of age       |   206   |    26    |   12.67\r\n  From  5 to 10 years of age |   233   |    20    |    8.61\r\n   \"   10 to 20   \"   \"   \"  |   183   |     9    |    4.9\r\n   \"   20 to 40   \"   \"   \"  |   232   |    39    |   16.7\r\n   \"   40 to 60   \"   \"   \"  |    47   |     6    |   12.7\r\n   \"   60 to 80   \"   \"   \"  |     4   |     2    |   50\r\n  ---------------------------+---------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe physicians above quoted lived in different parts of the city. All\r\nof them extended their visits and professional services to the sick to\r\nthe {648} very limits of physical endurance, and consequently included\r\nin the above lists some patients who were not able to procure the\r\ncomforts and attention necessary to the sick. Some cases also were\r\nincluded to which the physician was only brought that he might sign\r\nthe death-certificate and so avoid the coroner's inquest. After making\r\nallowance for increase of mortality on these scores, I think it safe\r\nto assert that the best results obtained in private practice varied\r\nfrom 7 to 10 per cent. of mortality-rate.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--While there is no one symptom pathognomonic of yellow\r\nfever in every stage of the disease, its differential diagnosis is\r\nnearly always possible. The morbid action of its special poison\r\nproduces phenomena sufficiently characteristic to prove its presence.\r\nThe sudden attack, the slight cold stage, the frontal and lumbar pain,\r\nand the capillary congestion are important diagnostic symptoms.\r\n\r\nEven in mild attacks this capillary blood-stasis is usually sufficient\r\nto alter the patient's countenance to such a degree as to attract\r\nattention. A great many different adjectives are used in description\r\nof the countenances of yellow-fever patients. While no one among them\r\nis constantly applicable, the presence of a changed facial expression\r\nshould enlist the physician's attention and incite investigation. If\r\nthis altered countenance be associated with watery or glistening\r\ninjected eyes, the probability of yellow fever is increased.\r\n\r\nThe slow pulse which coexists with elevated temperature is a point of\r\nmuch diagnostic value. But it must be remembered that this symptom is\r\nnot peculiar to yellow fever. I have noted this lack of correlation of\r\npulse and temperature in several cases of dengue. It is also not\r\ninfrequently found in ordinary cases of jaundice. The slow pulse of\r\nyellow fever must be attributable to the special action of the poison\r\nupon the nervous system. The heart's action may be slowed by\r\ninfluences exerted directly or through the retrograde effects of the\r\ndelay of blood-currents in the capillary distribution.\r\n\r\nAlbuminous urine is a symptom of much diagnostic importance.\r\n\r\nA tendency to hemorrhage may be safely stated to exist in all cases of\r\nyellow fever. In the mildest cases hemorrhage may not actually take\r\nplace unless the patients be non-gravid females within the ovulating\r\nlimits of life. These patients seldom pass through yellow-fever\r\nattacks without sanguineous vaginal discharges. But even in the\r\nmildest cases yellow fever establishes the hemorrhagic diathesis to an\r\nextent sufficient to render the occurrence of hemorrhage an imminent\r\nevent. This fact is shown first, by the congested and tumid gums, from\r\nwhich blood can be readily pressed, and also by the still more\r\nimportant circumstance that medical or hygienic mismanagement is so\r\nquickly and certainly followed by black vomit or by hemorrhages from\r\nother parts of the system. Capillary congestion is undoubtedly an\r\nimportant factor in the production of hemorrhages in yellow fever,\r\nsince we cannot otherwise account for the liability to hemorrhage\r\nwhich is so general in this disease.\r\n\r\nThe yellow color of the skin and eyes during life, and of the tissues\r\nand serum of the cadaver, is probably due to the coincident influence\r\nof two causes: first, to the coloring matter of the red corpuscles\r\ndiffused in the serum of the blood; second, to an accumulation of\r\nsecondary blood-poisons. The occurrence of the yellow color and its\r\nintensity bear a {649} direct relation to the sluggishness of\r\ncapillary circulation during the paroxysm. It appears likely,\r\ntherefore, that the yellowness is principally ascribable to coloring\r\nprinciples derived from dissolution of the blood, to which capillary\r\nobstruction would so strongly predispose this fluid.\r\n\r\nSchmidt has made a very careful résumé of the pathological changes\r\nfound after death from yellow fever. The most important and uniform of\r\nthese affected the nervous system, liver, and kidneys. They consisted\r\nfor the most part of hyperæmic conditions, not infrequently attended\r\nby points of extravasation and of degenerative changes. The latter are\r\nprincipally found in the liver, and bear some relation to the duration\r\nof the case, and it may be also to the degree and persistence of the\r\npyrexia. When the liver is the seat of fatty degeneration, it is\r\nyellowish in color in whole or in parts. It is then sometimes spoken\r\nof as the café au lait or the box-wood liver.\r\n\r\nIn cases which run a very rapid course these changes are not observed,\r\nbut only those which indicate congestion are found, and often\r\nhemorrhagic puncta. In these instances the depending portions of the\r\nbody have dark or livid ecchymoses.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--There are two propositions to which due attention should\r\nbe given before formulating rules for the treatment of yellow fever.\r\nThe first of these is, that yellow fever is strictly a self-limited\r\ndisease, and therefore is insusceptible of jugulation. Both clauses of\r\nthis proposition are indisputably true. Cases have been observed in\r\nwhich mitigation of symptoms and abridgment in duration appeared to\r\nfollow spontaneous diarrhoea. Such events must be extremely uncommon,\r\nsince in my large experience I know of but one such instance supported\r\nby good testimony.\r\n\r\nEfforts to abort the disease by purgatives, bleedings, cold baths,\r\nquinia, etc. have all signally failed. Among the possibilities of the\r\nfuture is the discovery that some drug or combination of drugs is\r\ncapable of meeting yellow-fever poison in the field of the circulation\r\nand antagonizing it sufficiently to rescue the victim from its fatal\r\ntoxic effects.\r\n\r\nThe second proposition is, that the formative stages of the\r\ndisease--that is, the early hours of the paroxysm--afford the most\r\nprecious moments for instituting such medication as may be considered\r\nproper. This proposition applies no doubt to a number of other acute\r\naffections, but in no one among them all is it so important to be\r\nregarded as in yellow fever. The primary effects of the poison are so\r\nboldly outlined that it appears highly probable that the damage it\r\nexerts upon the economy is chiefly inflicted during the paroxysm. This\r\naffords an additional reason why efforts at medication should be\r\nprincipally restricted to the paroxysm and to the earliest periods of\r\nthat stage.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that during an attack of yellow fever the patient's\r\nhold upon life is more or less secure in direct ratio to the number of\r\nfunctions which retain their physiological integrity fairly well. The\r\nsuggestion of such a fact should exclude all scholastic or routine\r\nrules of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn simple forms of yellow fever the first desideratum of the\r\npractitioner is to become acquainted with the patient's condition at\r\nthe moment of attack. If this has occurred after eating indigestible\r\nfood or after a hearty meal of any description, the stomach should be\r\nemptied. Ipecacuanha may be given in warm water or chamomile infusion\r\nuntil this result {650} has been accomplished. After emesis, provided\r\nthis should have been considered necessary or as a first step of\r\ntreatment under other circumstances, a purgative is usually given. The\r\nbenefits of purgation are, in my opinion, limited to the act of\r\nridding the bowels of any fecal accumulations present. For this\r\npurpose those purgatives which combine a due degree of efficiency with\r\ninoffensiveness in operation have appeared to me to be the best.\r\nCastor oil is at the head of this class. An ounce may be given to an\r\nadult in some acceptable vehicle. This may be followed by an enema of\r\ntepid water when required. Salines are more agreeable to the palate,\r\nbut far too unmanageable in their cathartic effects to be adopted\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nSome very good practitioners believe that a mercurial purge at the\r\nonset of the attack impresses the subsequent career of the case in\r\nsome favorable manner. I do not share in this opinion, but I do select\r\ncalomel as the preliminary purgative in cases where much gastric\r\nirritability attends the early periods of the attack. I exhibit it\r\nalso in those cases in which previous indisposition had occasioned\r\ncoating of the tongue, or in which other conditions of systemic\r\nderangement existed for which calomel is usually prescribed.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is desirable to avoid the disgust at taking a\r\npurgative or the perturbation it may occasion by its action. Enemas of\r\ntepid infusion of linseed or of milk and water may be substituted,\r\nwith the addition of castor oil when necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the early hours of the attack warm pediluvia are always grateful\r\nand proper. They are to be given by placing a basin of warm water near\r\nthe foot of the bed, beneath the covering of a light blanket or sheet,\r\nand allowing the patient's feet to remain immersed for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes. If the feet are cold, mustard should be added. During the\r\nfoot-bath the patient usually falls into a perspiration which is\r\nsometimes profuse and general.\r\n\r\nPerspiration is a desirable event during the paroxysm, although it is\r\nnot, like the sweatings of the malarial fevers, critical, in the sense\r\nof being accompanied by a marked decline in temperature. The idea that\r\nsweating is beneficial is so strongly and generally prevalent as to\r\ngive countenance to the erroneous practice of resting the cure of the\r\ndisease upon its production and maintenance. I have seen valuable\r\nlives sacrificed by obstinate persistence in measures to promote\r\ndiaphoresis, more especially in the later hours of the paroxysm or in\r\nthe succeeding or calm stage. It is quite sufficient to encourage the\r\nperspiration by the pediluvia and by a moderate allowance of cool,\r\npalatable drinks. Much value is attached by non-professional persons\r\nto a warm infusion of orange-leaves or some other warm and grateful\r\nbeverage. When agreeable to patients I permit them in moderate\r\namounts, but do not regard them as especially valuable.\r\n\r\nJaborandi has been used in yellow fever. Strong hopes were quite\r\nnaturally based upon the action of this drug in exciting excretory\r\nfunctions, especially diaphoresis, but the observations of my friend\r\nDr. Thomas Layton and of others show that it possesses no special\r\nvalue, while it frequently increases the vomiting and has to be\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nAfter the bowels have been relieved of fecal accumulations it is good\r\npractice to exhibit a scruple of quinia in solution with ten to thirty\r\n{651} drops of tincture of opium, by rectal injection. Infusion of\r\nlinseed or mucilage of elm-bark or gum-arabic are the best vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe combined action of the quinia and opium mitigates the patient's\r\nheadache and lumbar pains. But the influence of these drugs is not\r\nlimited to their effect on the nerves of sensation. In quite a\r\nproportion of cases reaction is not so prompt or complete as usual; or\r\nreaction may be quite pronounced, and still the surface may alternate\r\nbetween a dry and a perspiring state. These oscillations of function\r\nof the organic nerves are also often corrected by this prescription.\r\nIn the great majority of simple cases no other medication than this is\r\nrequisite or proper, for no medication is proper in yellow fever\r\nunless it is requisite.\r\n\r\nWhen the neuralgias are excessively violent, opium may be again\r\nadministered, preferably by enema, and in combination with bromide of\r\npotassium or chloral hydrate. But the effects of opium in limiting\r\nexcretory function must always be borne in mind and carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nExternal applications are very efficacious in relieving the\r\nneuralgias. In the southern part of this country the \"eau sedative\" of\r\nRaspail is greatly used. This is a mixture of ammonia, camphor, and\r\ncommon salt in solution, and may be prepared extemporaneously. The\r\napplications may be made hot or cold, but if used cold they must be\r\ncontinuously kept up. It is therefore better to use them warm if\r\nsufficiently effective. Stimulating embrocations of turpentine or\r\nmustard, or dry or wet cups, are sometimes resorted to for relief of\r\npain.\r\n\r\nExcessive temperature demands attention and antagonistic treatment in\r\ndirect measure with its persistence, its degree, and its occurrence in\r\nadvanced periods of an attack.\r\n\r\nIn the epidemic of 1867, I used gelsemium as an antipyretic in fifty\r\ncases or more, but the results were so unsatisfactory that I have\r\nquite abandoned its exhibition. I have given quinia as an antipyretic,\r\nbut never in doses of more than a scruple. In these doses it has\r\nfailed to accomplish the desired result in the great majority of the\r\ncases. Perhaps its antipyretic effects are limited to those cases in\r\nwhich malaria is a known or an unknown complication.\r\n\r\nI have exhibited small doses of digitalis with apparent benefit, but\r\naconite and veratrum viride I have long since discarded. The physician\r\ncannot afford to sacrifice gastric quietude and competency of function\r\nto the use of remedies whose value as antipyretics is, to say the\r\nmost, quite doubtful.\r\n\r\nCold has for a long period of time been brought into use as an\r\nantipyretic in yellow fever. Its positive value and instantaneous\r\naction should be constantly borne in mind, and in the hyperpyrexia of\r\nyellow fever it constitutes by far the most reliable remedy, though\r\nits mode of application must be carefully adapted to the degree of\r\nfever present and to the susceptibilities of the patient. Cold drinks\r\nin limited quantities, but frequently repeated; cold spongings of the\r\nsurface, or the use of the cold pack, especially in very high degrees\r\nof body heat; large injections of cold water per rectum, which may be\r\npassed off and repeated once in two to four hours,--form safe and\r\neffective modes of treatment.\r\n\r\nHemorrhages are a constant source of anxiety in yellow fever. It is\r\nvery true that persons do not often die from actual loss of blood. I\r\ndo not know that I have ever witnessed such an event except when the\r\n{652} blood was poured out from a recently-emptied uterus. But the\r\nchances of recovery are lessened, because the hemorrhagic state\r\nindicates a degree of spoliation of both the fluids and solids of the\r\nsystem incompatible with maintenance of life. When this condition of\r\nconstitution is once established, the stomach rarely escapes, and in a\r\nmajority of instances it is the first, and sometimes the only,\r\nbleeding surface. The treatment should be directed, first, to the\r\ngreat indication of correcting the hemorrhagic diathesis; secondly, to\r\nquiet gastric irritability, in order that vomiting shall not cause\r\nrupture of capillaries. To meet the first indication I regard\r\nnutrition and stimulants as the most important measures of treatment.\r\nThe mode of administration will be specially referred to under the\r\nhead of alimentation.\r\n\r\nHæmostatic remedies, given as specific treatment, generally fail in\r\naccomplishing the purpose for which they are administered. It has\r\nalways appeared to me that those therapeutic agents which are capable\r\nof controlling hemorrhage where yellow fever is not present are\r\ncompletely neutralized by the effects of its toxic agent upon the\r\nvaso-motor nerves. Consequently, while ergot, turpentine, gallic acid,\r\nand other like remedies may be resorted to, too much hope should not\r\nbe entertained as to their good effects.\r\n\r\nSome excellent practitioners rely greatly on preparations of iron. The\r\ntincture of the chloride is undoubtedly the best. This may be given in\r\nwater or upon shaved ice in doses of five or ten drops every half\r\nhour. To allay the gastric irritability pellets of ice should be\r\nswallowed. Effervescing drinks may be given with benefit.\r\n\r\nI have often used with good results the following prescription:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Sodii Bicarb.          gr. xx;\r\n      Morphiæ Sulph.         gr. ss.\r\n      Aquæ Lauro-Cerasi,\r\n      Aquæ Menth. Pip. _aa._ fl. drachm iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. Teaspoonful after every act of emesis.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I have given the following prescription:\r\n\r\n  Rx. Creasoti               gtt. viij;\r\n      Tinct. Opii Deodorat.  gtt. xl.\r\n      Aquæ Menth. Pip.,\r\n      Muc. Acaciæ      _aa._ fl. drachm iv. M.\r\n\r\nS. Teaspoonful after every act of emesis in iced Seltzer or\r\nApollinaris water, or in champagne.\r\n\r\nSometimes a few drops of chloroform in a spoonful of iced mucilage of\r\nacacia act favorably.\r\n\r\nIn cases which appear utterly hopeless the physician, acting\r\ndesperately, is sometimes able to save life by treatment which could\r\nscarcely be safely recommended. I once administered a fourth of a\r\ngrain of morphia to a child of seven years, who, after a sleep of ten\r\nhours, ceased to throw up black vomit and recovered.\r\n\r\nExternal applications to the epigastrium usually afford some relief to\r\nnausea at any stage of yellow fever. Mustard or aromatic cataplasms\r\nmay at all times be used with hopes of favorable effects. Towels wrung\r\nfrom cold water are very efficacious. Sometimes a drachm or two of\r\nchloroform dashed over them increases their anti-emetic action.\r\n\r\nSuppression of urine is generally a symptom of fatal import. {653}\r\nAttempts may be made to establish the secretion by dry or wet cups in\r\nthe lumbar region, by warm applications around the loins, or by\r\nmustard cataplasms or blisters. If the condition of the patient's\r\nstomach is such as to permit this practice, copious diluent drinks and\r\ndiuretics should be given. Lemonade holding bitartrate of potassium in\r\nsolution is generally the most acceptable, and probably the most\r\nefficient. Some physicians think they oftener obtain good results from\r\nsmall and frequently repeated doses of turpentine. I can bear\r\ntestimony to the good results which sometimes follow large rectal\r\ninjections of warm or cold water, the latter being preferable when\r\nthere is high fever.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases of yellow fever reaction from the cold stage is\r\nfeeble and imperfect, or perhaps may not occur at all. This departure\r\nfrom type is very fatal. The patients are stupid, sometimes\r\nsemi-comatose and incoherent, from the earliest hours of the attack.\r\nThe face is listless, drunken, or idiotic in expression. The color of\r\nthe skin is dark olive and almost livid. The print of a hand on the\r\nchest is very slowly effaced. Sometimes the surface is covered with a\r\npeculiarly unctuous perspiration. The pulse is feeble and\r\ncompressible; the temperature seldom more than one or two degrees\r\nabove the normal standard. Albuminous urine is found during the first\r\nday. Death, attended by convulsive rigors, generally closes the scene\r\nwithin seventy-two hours from the moment of seizure.\r\n\r\nHot mustard-baths should be resorted to. Blood may be drawn by cups or\r\nleeches from the back of the neck or temples, and this may be followed\r\nby the application of a blister. Morphia and atropia may be exhibited\r\nsubcutaneously in small doses, to be repeated as often as proper.\r\nQuinia may be administered per rectum or by the hypodermic method.\r\nLastly, pilocarpine may be thrown into the tissues in sufficient doses\r\nto procure its vigorous physiological action.\r\n\r\nAlmost in precise symptomatic contrast with these cases of failure in\r\nreaction is another form of attack, in which violent disturbances of\r\nnerve-function occurs; such cases often being characterized as\r\ncongestive in type. The most typical of these attacks are among\r\nchildren or adolescents. If attended by noticeable chill, it is\r\nordinarily slight. Reaction is quick and excessively violent. The face\r\nis flushed, the eyes injected, and convulsions with delirium are\r\nliable to occur as early symptoms. I have watched with much interest\r\nthe alternate flushings and pallor of the countenance occurring in\r\nthese cases, such as are often observed in basilar meningitis.\r\n\r\nThe treatment in this type of attacks should include chloroform by\r\ninhalation in sufficient amount to control convulsions. Chloral\r\nhydrate may be administered by enema, or morphia hypodermically.\r\nCathartic doses of calomel often exert a beneficial effect. Leeches or\r\ncups, to be followed by cold applications or by blisters, may be\r\napplied about the head or neck. But cupping and leeching should only\r\nbe resorted to in the treatment of grave symptoms, since obstinate\r\nhemorrhage is liable to occur from any and every point from which the\r\ncuticle has been removed.\r\n\r\nYellow fever is often masked during the paroxysm by some pre-existing\r\ndisease. Malarial fevers, the febrile states of pulmonary consumption\r\nor of the recently-delivered female, may all mask the early clinical\r\n{654} phenomena to such a degree that the most experienced and\r\nvigilant practitioners are sometimes astonished to find black vomit,\r\nsuppression of urine, and all those symptoms which mark the last\r\nstages of the disease, suddenly developed.\r\n\r\nWalking cases should be classed in the same category as masked forms.\r\nIn these instances the early symptoms are so slight as to be\r\noverlooked or neglected by their subjects. They continue to prosecute\r\ntheir usual pursuits until, by sheer exhaustion, they are driven to\r\nbeds from which they seldom arise.\r\n\r\nThe hygienic and dietetic management of yellow-fever patients is\r\nextremely important, and the strictest attention must be paid to the\r\ncondition and discipline of the sick chamber. In this disease those\r\noccurrences and circumstances which in other affections would be\r\nreckoned as unimportant and trivial become matters of serious\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThe physician, by a composed and cheerful demeanor, often decides\r\nwhich end of the balance shall go down. But an intelligent,\r\nexperienced, and faithful nurse is equally as important as the\r\nexcellent physician.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be confined in strictly recumbent positions, and\r\nall drinks and foods must be given through tubes or from pap-cups. It\r\nfrequently occurs that patients are unable to void the bladder in such\r\npositions. In these cases the catheter should be used, rather than\r\nsuffer any violation of the rule which demands a maintenance of\r\nunbroken decubitus.\r\n\r\nThe sick room should be kept freely ventilated, and the patient's\r\nbedding should be changed, when requisite, by removing him to one side\r\nof the bed while the other is renovated. If the patient's night-shirt\r\nbecomes soiled and disagreeable, it may be cut so as to remove it, and\r\nanother, cut in the same manner, may be substituted and stitched\r\ntogether. The room must be kept quiet, and useless visiting entirely\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nCool and grateful drinks may be given in any stage or state of yellow\r\nfever if demanded by patients. The quantity allowed at one time should\r\nbe small, since over-distension of the stomach almost certainly causes\r\nvomiting. Effervescing drinks are nearly always grateful, and are\r\nbetter tolerated than others. Seltzer-water and lemonade, or Seltzer\r\nor Apollinaris on shaved ice, are to be recommended. Sometimes\r\npatients call for sparkling wines or beers. I never refuse them or any\r\nother alcoholic drink asked for in any stage of the disease. Wine\r\nsurely possesses valuable therapeutic effects in yellow fever.\r\n\r\nAlimentation must be severely controlled by the physician, and the\r\ntolerance and effects constantly watched. Even to the most experienced\r\nphysician the kind of food to be selected, and the time and manner of\r\nadministration, constitute difficult problems. In simple forms of the\r\ndisease food had better be strictly withheld during the continuance of\r\nthe paroxysm. Even after the stage of calm has been reached,\r\nsufficient time should be allowed to elapse to enable the physician to\r\nform some estimate of the degree of damage his patient has suffered\r\nand his competency to retain foods and be nourished by them. This\r\nquestion can seldom be answered in a decided manner, except through a\r\ncautious trial of some bland and inoffensive food.\r\n\r\n{655} On the third or fourth day of sickness a single tablespoonful of\r\niced milk may be given, and the immediate consequences closely\r\nwatched. If no retching or gastric uneasiness should ensue, it may be\r\nrepeated at the end of thirty minutes. Some physicians prefer to begin\r\nwith spoonful doses of equal parts of sweet milk and thin\r\nbarley-water. In my own experience chicken-water has proved to be the\r\nmost universally acceptable, as well as the most beneficial, of all\r\nthe various forms of nutriment to be chosen as a first venture. I have\r\nfrequently combined this with barley-water when first given. In this\r\ncautious and tentative manner even the most experienced physician\r\nprefers to proceed, rather than to attempt to prescribe rules of diet\r\nin an abstract and arbitrary manner.\r\n\r\nIf these light articles of diet are well borne, they are to be\r\ngradually and watchfully exchanged for beef-essences, the blood of a\r\nrare beefsteak, and the more substantial broths. Solid articles of\r\nfood should not be allowed during the first ten days after an attack,\r\nand for still longer periods patients should be admonished against\r\nexcesses in eating, and especially in respect to indigestible\r\narticles. Those lesions of the blood and of the stomach, and those\r\ngrave disorders of nerve-function which occasion hæmatemesis in yellow\r\nfever, are slowly repaired. Instances are reported in which black\r\nvomit and death have followed excessive eating and drinking ten or\r\ntwenty days after dismissal from treatment.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain conditions which are liable to complicate\r\nyellow fever which demand a course of dietetic procedure different\r\nfrom that which I have recommended. Thus, children cannot bear\r\nprivation of food until the paroxysm is over if its duration is long.\r\nIn like manner, a more supporting course is required in most of those\r\ncases in which yellow fever occurs as an intercurrent affection, in\r\nall those cases which are termed typhoid or adynamic per se, and, more\r\nemphatically still, in every case in which hemorrhages are occurring.\r\nA failing pulse should in all instances admonish us to resort to\r\nnourishment and stimulants.\r\n\r\nIt is a fortunate circumstance that in yellow fever the lower bowel is\r\ngenerally in a state favorable for the retention of nutritious enemas.\r\nIn the most trying and critical hours of desperate cases I have seen\r\npatients tided through by the use of skilfully prepared and skilfully\r\nadministered injections of some suitable meat-essence. When insomnia\r\nexists, chloral hydrate or bromide of potassium may be conveniently\r\ngiven in these vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the discussion of the vastly important sanitary\r\nquestions pertaining to the prevention of yellow fever cannot be\r\nappropriately discussed in the present article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{656}\r\n\r\nDIPHTHERIA.\r\n\r\nBY A. JACOBI, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION; SYNONYMS; HISTORY.--Diphtheria is a specific, infectious,\r\nand contagious disease, characterized principally by epithelial\r\nchanges in, and the exudation of fibrin on and into mucous membranes,\r\nthe surface of wounds, and the rete Malpighii, thereby constituting\r\nthe so-called pseudo-membrane. Under the names ulcus syriacum, ulcus\r\nægyptiacum, garotillo, morbus suffocans, morbus suffocatorius,\r\naffectus suffocatorius, pestilentis gutturis affectio, pedancho\r\nmaligna, angina maligna, angina passio, mal de gorge gangréneux,\r\nulcère gangréneux, angina polyposa, angine couenneuse, cynanche,\r\ncroup, diphtheritis, and diphtheria, the disease has been known and\r\ndescribed at different periods by the writers of different nations.\r\nThe Hippocratic writings and some remarks in the Talmud allow of some\r\ndoubt in regard to their explanation. Whether their authors observed\r\nor recognized diphtheria cannot be proven. There is less doubt in\r\nregard to Archigenes, quoted by Oribasius. Aretæus of Cappadocia is\r\nnotably the first, if we except Asclepiades only, who is said to have\r\nperformed laryngotomy. The description of the pharyngeal and laryngeal\r\nmanifestations furnished by the former, however, can leave no doubt in\r\nour minds that he knew diphtheria and recognized it. Galen, in his\r\nremarks on the Chironian ulcer, tells us that the pseudo-membrane was\r\ngotten rid of by coughing when the respiratory passages were affected\r\nby the disease, and by hawking when the disease was in the pharynx.\r\nCælius Aurelianus recognized diphtheria of the pharynx and larynx, as\r\nwell as the diphtheritic paralysis of the soft palate; it is to him we\r\nare indebted for the information that Asclepiades resorted to\r\nscarification of the tonsils, and even to laryngotomy. Aëtius in the\r\nfifth century distinguished white and grayish patches and gangrenous\r\ndegeneration, observed paralysis of the soft palate, and advised\r\nagainst energetic local treatment and the forcible removal of the\r\ndeposits before they were in a condition to fall off spontaneously.\r\nThe Arabs and Arabists contain no allusions to the subject, but early\r\nchronicles tell of an epidemic raging in St. Denis in 580, subsequent\r\nto a great inundation. There appear to have been memorable epidemics\r\nin Rome in 856 and 1005, in Byzantium in 1004. The former are\r\nmentioned by Baronius, the latter by Cedrenus.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Haeser, _Lehrb. a. Gesch. du Med. u. d. Epidem. Krankh._,\r\n3d ed., vol. iii., p. 434.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Morejon, Gutierrez wrote his _Tradado del enfermedad del\r\ngarrotillo_ in the second half of the fifteenth century. A malignant\r\nform of angina raged in 1517 in Switzerland, along the Rhine, and in\r\nthe Netherlands; in 1544 and 1545 in Northern Germany and on the\r\nRhine; {657} in 1557 in France, Germany, and Holland; to the latter\r\nrefer the reports of Tetrus Fosterus. Antonio Soglia, quoted by\r\nChomel, describes an epidemic in Naples and Sicily (1563), which\r\nspread in the following year as far as Constantinople; Joannes Wierus,\r\nepidemics in Dantzic, Cologne, and Augsburg (1565); Ballonius\r\n(Baillon), in Paris (1576). At the same time this disease was frequent\r\nin Denmark. From Spain there are reports on severe epidemics between\r\nthe years 1583 and 1618; the year 1613 was long known as the year of\r\ndiphtheria (anno de los garrotillos).\r\n\r\nMercado (1608) speaks of a child that had communicated the disease to\r\nhis father by biting his finger. Casealez advised gargles containing\r\nalum and sulphate of copper. Herrera described diphtheria of the skin\r\nand of wounds, and looked upon the pseudo-membrane as the essential\r\ncharacteristic of the disease. Heredia, in 1690, recognized the\r\nsuffocative and asthenic forms, as well as the paralysis of the soft\r\npalate, the pharynx, and the limbs; he also called attention to the\r\noccurrence of relapses, which he attributed to the absorption of the\r\nmorbid products, and endeavored to prevent by cauterization.\r\n\r\nNaples had diphtheria 1610-45, in its worse form 1618-20, together\r\nwith erysipelas, and diphtheritic affection amongst cattle. About\r\nthose times tracheotomy was often performed by Severino, the same who\r\nfound pseudo-membrane in the larynx at a post-mortem examination made\r\nin 1642. In 1620 the disease was in Portugal, Sicily, and Malta; in\r\n1630 in Spain, according to Fontechu, Villa Real, and Herrera. It was\r\nremarked that in some instances no membranes were perceived in the\r\nthroat, but the cases were liable to terminate fatally with large\r\nglandular swellings round the neck and general symptoms of adynamia.\r\nSicily was again invaded in 1632, Rome in 1634, Italy from 1642 to\r\n1650, Spain in 1666. The Italian reports emphasize the marked\r\ncontagiousness of the disease and its tendency to depress the vital\r\npowers, also the weakness of the mental faculties left behind. In\r\nGermany the disease was described by Wedel in 1718. The epidemics\r\nobserved by him were not very instructive, yet they sufficed to teach\r\nthe importance of isolating the sick.\r\n\r\nIn the New England States diphtheria appeared in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Samuel Danforth lost the four youngest of his twelve children\r\nby the \"malady of bladders in the windpipe\" within a fortnight in\r\nDecember, 1659, in Roxbury, Mass. John Josselyn mentions an epidemic\r\nin New England, mainly in Maine, which lasted at least until the year\r\n1671. Mr. Douglass reports another, which commenced on the 20th of\r\nMarch, 1735, in Kingston township, about fifty miles east of Boston,\r\nand extended all over, and also to Boston, where it was mild at first.\r\nBut in 1738 it was very severe, and remained so for some time. Indeed,\r\nit did not abate for a long time, to judge from a letter of Cadwalader\r\nColden written in 1753 to Dr. Fothergill, and the two letters of Dr.\r\nJacob Ogden, written in 1769 and 1774 to Mr. Hugh Gaine of New York;\r\nas also from John Archer's \"Inaugural Dissertation on Cynanche\r\nTrachealis, commonly called Croup or Hives,\" published in 1798.[2] In\r\n1809 there was a severe epidemic in Philadelphia;[3] in 1816 in Crete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For extensive quotations from these and other writers on\r\ndiphtheria at a very interesting period of our medical literature, see\r\nA. Jacobi, _A Treatise on Diphtheria_, New York, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Caldwell, in ed. of Cullen's _First Lines of the Practice\r\nof Physic_, Philadelphia, 1816, 1, p. 260.]\r\n\r\n{658} The reports of Le Cât concerning epidemics in Rouen in 1736 and\r\n1737 being doubtful, the first great epidemic must be set down, in\r\nFrance, for 1745. It commenced in Paris, and invaded the provinces\r\nafterward. Chomel gave an accurate description of the diphtheritic\r\nparalysis of the soft palate, and reports a case of strabismus.\r\nEpidemics are reported from the Netherlands in 1745, 1746, 1769, 1770,\r\n1778-86; from Spain in 1764-71; from England in 1744-48 (by Starr),\r\nfrom Plymouth, England, in 1751-53 (Thurham) and 1776. Dropsy and\r\nglandular swellings were frequent; emetics and pure air were the\r\nsheet-anchors of treatment. The Netherlands, France, and the West\r\nIndies were invaded from 1770-80 by the disease, which was found often\r\ncomplicated with scarlatina; Portugal in 1786 and 1787; France again\r\nin 1787 and 1788; Northern Germany in 1790. At that time, particularly\r\nin France, the main reliance was had on the internal administration of\r\ncinchona and the insufflation into the throat of alum.\r\n\r\nEpidemics have been described since from different localities in\r\ndifferent years: in Glasgow, 1812 and 1819; Switzerland, 1823-26;\r\nNorway and St. Helena, 1824; New York and Kentucky, 1826 and 1828;\r\nFrench provinces, 1834; Paris, 1841; several parts of Europe and North\r\nAmerica, 1845-56; Paris, 1853-55; England, 1854 and 1859, when 95 per\r\ncent. of all the cases of nasal diphtheria proved fatal; Netherlands\r\nand Sweden, 1855; all Western Europe, 1855-65, up to the present time,\r\nand all Europe since; California, 1856 and 1857; Portugal and France,\r\n1856; Eastern Prussia, 1850, 1852, 1856, 1857; and all the countries\r\nwith a cold or moderate climate to this very day.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the eighteenth century but two writers are\r\nworthy of especial notice--Home, a Scotchman, 1765, and Samuel Bard,\r\nan American, 1771.\r\n\r\nHome deserves credit for having distinctly drawn the line between the\r\npseudo-membranous and the gangrenous affections. He also endeavored to\r\nprove that croup and angina maligna were two distinct diseases,\r\nnotwithstanding all that had been said since the time of Aretæus in\r\nfavor of their identity. The false membrane of croup he looked upon as\r\nan aggregation of mucus. He sought for it exclusively in the\r\nrespiratory tract, and disregarded any connection between it and the\r\nfalse membrane found in the pharynx.\r\n\r\nBard's experience was very extensive; he saw membranous pharyngitis,\r\nlaryngitis, and pharyngo-laryngitis; he speaks of the membrane as met\r\nupon the skin, of paralysis of the muscles of deglutition and of the\r\nlarynx, and likewise of paralysis of the lower extremities, as\r\nsequelæ. He looked upon the morbific process as the same whichever\r\nwere the mucous membranes attacked, and made a distinction only\r\naccording to the localization of the disease. The influence which he\r\nmight have exercised in shaping the professional opinion on the nature\r\nof the disease did not make itself felt, partly because of his\r\nclassical modesty, and partly because of his remoteness from the\r\ncentres of European learning. Not before 1810 was his book translated\r\ninto French (by Ruette). While his style is classical in its\r\nsimplicity, his observation is astonishingly correct, and his\r\nconclusions as to the actual identity of all the diphtheritic\r\nprocesses in the most various clinical symptoms unimpeachable this\r\nvery day. His description of the various forms of pharyngeal\r\ndiphtheria is painfully {659} good, his observations on cutaneous\r\ndiphtheria very accurate, his few dissections well recorded,\r\nparticularly when he speaks of tracheal and tracheo-laryngeal\r\ndiphtheria, and his historical reviews very judicious indeed. \"Upon\r\nthe whole, I am led to conclude that the morbus strangulatorius of the\r\nItalians, the croup of Home, the malignant ulcerous sore throat of\r\nHuxham and Fothergill, and the disease I have described and that first\r\ndescribed by Douglas of Boston, however they may differ in symptoms,\r\ndo all bear an essential affinity and relation to each other, or are\r\napt to run into each other, and, in fact, arise from the same leaven.\r\nThe disease I have described appeared evidently to be of an infectious\r\nnature, and, being drawn in by the breath of a healthy child,\r\nirritated the glands of the throat and windpipe. The infection did not\r\nseem to depend so much on any prevailing disposition of the air as\r\nupon effluvia received from the breath of infected persons. This will\r\naccount why the disorder sometimes went through a whole family, and\r\nyet did not affect the next-door neighbors. Here we learn a useful\r\nlesson--viz. to remove young children as soon as any one of them is\r\ntaken with the disease, by which many lives have been saved and may\r\nagain be preserved.\"\r\n\r\nJurine, in his prize essay of 1807, denies the gangrenous nature of\r\nangina maligna and emphasizes the frequent complication of membranous\r\ncroup with membranous pharyngitis. It was reserved for Bretonneau to\r\nenforce attention to the ideas of Bard by asserting (though he did not\r\nmention either his monograph or its French translation of 1810) the\r\nidentity of angina maligna, or by whatever other title it may be\r\nknown, with membranous laryngitis, and by inaugurating his theory with\r\na new name for the disease to perpetuate the views expressed therein.\r\nFirst and foremost, he called attention to the continuity of the\r\nmembrane (according to him, composed of coagulated mucus and fibrin)\r\nof the nose, pharynx, and respiratory tract, its identity with certain\r\nmorbid conditions of the skin, and promulgated the theory that\r\n\"diphtherite\"--the name dates from that time--is a specific disease,\r\nan affection sui generis, and differs both from a catarrhal and a\r\nscarlatinous inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe modern history of diphtheria may be dated from June 26, 1821, when\r\nBretonneau read his first essay on that subject before the French\r\nAcademy of Medicine, and gave to the disease the name it now bears.\r\nHis second and third (Nov. 25th) papers belong to the same year; his\r\nfourth was read in March, 1826; his fifth appeared in the _Archives\r\ngén._ of January and September, 1855. It was only in 1826 that the\r\nmaterial, previously gathered, was summed up in his celebrated\r\nmonograph.[4] Before this time, however, the separate essays had\r\nreceived prominence from the reports and commentaries of Guersant, who\r\nlaid particular stress on the statement that diphtheria was a\r\nnon-gangrenous affection, identical, and even synchronous, with croup\r\nin the majority of epidemics. Since that epoch the literature on the\r\nsubject has assumed enormous proportions. It is a matter of regret\r\nthat the limited space allotted to this subject should exclude much\r\nhistorical detail of the etiology, pathology, and therapeutics of\r\ndiphtheria. If the history of any disease is interesting, and the\r\nneglect of its study has ever punished itself, it is diphtheria. {660}\r\nParticularly would the treatment have been more successful if the\r\nknowledge of former times had been available and more heeded. As long\r\nago as in the seventeenth century depletion in diphtheria was\r\ncondemned, and in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the local\r\ntreatment with muriatic acid and the internal administration of\r\ncinchona, camphor, and roborant diet were held to be the only\r\nadmissible ones. Bretonneau urged the same principles, and still in\r\nour own times, for want of historical knowledge, we had to learn the\r\nold lesson over again.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: P. Bretonneau, _Des Inflammations spéciales du tissu\r\nmuqueux, et en particulier de la Diphthérite, etc._, Paris, 1826.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See history and bibliography of diphtheria in Chatto;\r\nSanné, _Traité de la Diphthérie_, Paris, 1874; Jacobi, in _Gerhardt's\r\nHandb. d. Kinderk._, vol. ii., 1877; Seitz, _Diphtheric und Croup\r\ngesch. u. Klin. dargest_, Berlin, 1879; _Index-Catalogue of the\r\nLibrary of the Surgeon-General's Office, U.S.A._, vol. iii.,\r\nWashington, 1882.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief review of the main points of discussion upon\r\nsubjects connected with the symptomatology and pathology of diphtheria\r\nsince Bretonneau's first paper:\r\n\r\nBourquoise and Brunet express their belief (1823) in the contagious\r\ncharacter of this disease. Desruelles (1824) sees a diagnostic\r\ndifference between the sporadic and the epidemic forms in the\r\nparticipation of the brain in the latter. Louis referred a number of\r\ncases of croup in adults to pharyngeal diphtheria as their source.\r\nMackenzie considers that croup has its origin in the fauces, and urges\r\nthe employment of lunar caustic. Billard (1826) denies the specific\r\ncharacter of diphtheritic inflammation. Hamilton describes cases that\r\nterminated in suppuration, and which he therefore distinguishes from\r\nBretonneau's cases. He describes two modes of termination of the\r\ndisease--one in croup, the other in a state of debility arising from\r\nthe effect of the absorbed secretion on the respiratory nerves. Pretty\r\nlooks upon those cases of croup that have their original seat in the\r\ntonsils as contagious. Bland (1827) explains the difference between\r\ncroup and diphtheria. Deslandes declares them to be identical.\r\nBretonneau publishes a work in which he compares diphtheria with\r\nscarlatina anginosa, and recommends the use of alum. Emmangard is the\r\nfirst one of the physiological school who, likening diphtheria to\r\ntyphoid and claiming its origin in a malarial infection, calls it\r\nangina gastro-enterica. Abercrombie is in favor of distinguishing\r\ndiphtheria from croup, but reports a number of cases of diphtheria of\r\nthe pharynx that terminated fatally by stenosis of the larynx. Ribes,\r\nwho encountered the disease in nine members of a single family,\r\nasserts that croup rarely occurred without a preceding diphtheria in\r\nhis experience; he advises an examination of the throats of apparently\r\nhealthy individuals. Fuchs relates the history of epidemics of angina\r\nmaligna, and declares croup to be a genuine angina maligna trachealis,\r\nwhich only does not run through all the stages. Broussais opposes the\r\nidentity of croup and diphtheria (1829), and gives a report of cures\r\nby means of antiphlogistic regimen and laryngotomy. Diphtheria and\r\ngangrenous angina are synonymous with him. Gendron expresses a belief\r\nin the identity of diphtheria and gangrenous angina. Roche considers\r\nthe membrane rather of hemorrhagic than of inflammatory origin, and\r\nconsisting of discolored fibrin. About the same time Trousseau is\r\nendeavoring to clearly establish the diagnosis between diphtheria and\r\nscarlatinous angina. Shortly after (1830), he reports cases of\r\ndiphtheria which originated in blistering wounds, and of diphtheria of\r\nthe skin giving rise to throat affections, and {661} diphtheria of the\r\nthroat followed by skin disease. T. F. Hoffmann cites a severe case,\r\nthat ultimately recovered, with consecutive paralysis of certain\r\ncranial nerves. Cheyne (1833) makes a stand against the \"confounding\r\nof croup and cynanche maligna under the name of diphtheritis.\"\r\nBourgeois witnessed an epidemic succeeding mumps.\r\n\r\nFricout and Burley (1836) declare their belief in the contagiousness\r\nof the disease. Bouillaud attacks the theory of its specific character\r\non the ground that abstraction of blood produced favorable results.\r\nStokes makes a distinction between primary and secondary croup\r\naccording to the original seat of the affection (1837). Kessler\r\nadvocates (1841) the view of its contagious nature, and Rilliet and\r\nBarthez adduce evidence of the occurrence of ulceration and gangrene\r\nin the course of the disease. Taupin, like Ribes, enjoins a methodical\r\nexamination of the throat of every patient during the prevalence of an\r\nepidemic of diphtheria, whatsoever be the disease from which the child\r\nsuffers. Boudet (1842) opposes Bretonneau's hypothesis that croup is a\r\ndescending diphtheria, and holds to the identity of diphtheria and\r\ngangrenous angina. In this contest Durand (1843) also takes sides\r\nagainst Bretonneau, and lays particular stress on the point that the\r\ndiphtheritic patient succumbs rather from the severity of the\r\nconstitutional symptoms than from suffocation. Rilliet and Barthez, on\r\nthe other hand, rally to the support of the attacked master, asserting\r\nthat the usual form of croup and that resulting from a descending\r\ndiphtheritis are one and the same, while they claim that diphtheritis\r\nand gangrenous angina are distinct affections.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the strife regarding the nature of the disease continued.\r\nGuersant and Blache (1844) describe the stomatite couenneuse (noma,\r\nstomacace, according to them, the rarest kind of gangrenous angina) as\r\na form of Bretonneau's diphtheritis, and Landsberg raises the question\r\nwhether a nerve-inflammation, present in a certain case, was to be\r\nlooked upon as an accidental or an essential feature of the disease,\r\nand finally comes to the conclusion, with Schönlein, that it was a\r\nneurophlogosis dependent on the disease. Bouisson (1847) reports a\r\ncase of diphtheritic conjunctivitis resulting in loss of the eye.\r\nRobert publishes his observations on diphtheria of the skin and of\r\nwounds, which he attributes to an atmospheric contamination in crowded\r\nwards of hospitals, and looks upon it, with Delpech and Eisenmann, as\r\na form of hospital gangrene. Virchow, in the same year, distinguished\r\nthe catarrhal, croupous, and diphtheritic varieties of the disease.\r\nMeanwhile, reports of paralysis of the soft palate after diphtheria\r\ncame from Morisseau, from Trousseau and Lasegue, and lastly (1854-59)\r\nfrom Maingault. The subject of diphtheritic conjunctivitis was studied\r\nby A. v. Graefe (1854), who encountered the disease as a complication\r\nof diphtheria of the pharynx, nose, and skin, and hence considered it\r\na part of the general disease rather than an independent local\r\naffection. Diphtheria, in its effects on the system, had at the same\r\ntime been investigated by Trousseau, who sums up with the statement\r\nthat the principal source of danger lies in the invasion of the\r\nlarynx, and that the large majority of cases of croup began as a\r\ndiphtheria of the pharynx, but that, even without the occurrence of a\r\nlaryngeal localization, many cases terminate fatally owing to\r\nadynamia.\r\n\r\nOutside of France, too, the subject had attracted attention. West, who\r\nhad never seen the disease occur primarily, describes diphtheria as a\r\n{662} complication of measles. Bamberger (1855) divides the\r\ninflammations of the mouth and pharynx into the catarrhal and croupous\r\nforms, and considers croup and diphtheria to be subdivisions of the\r\nlatter form, differing only in degree. The paralysis of the muscles of\r\ndeglutition is discussed by Dehænne (1857) who had contracted the\r\ndisease, and the paralysis of other muscles by Faure. A case of\r\ndiphtheria of the tonsils, nipples, and vagina in a woman recently\r\nconfined, followed by infection of the new-born and the death of both,\r\nis reported by Mathieux; and cases of diphtheritic conjunctivitis by\r\nGrichard, Warlomont, and Testelin. The same year Isambert published a\r\nwork in which he divided the diphtheritic affections into three\r\nforms--viz. angine couenneuse, scarlatinous angina, and diphtheritic\r\nangina. The last-mentioned is further subdivided into a\r\ncroupous-diphtheritic angina, in which croup of the larynx plays an\r\nimportant part, and into that form in which death results from\r\nadynamia; in the latter form there is a marked swelling of the\r\nlymphatic glands. Apparently, at this time the epidemic in Paris\r\nunderwent a considerable change, for the croupous form does not occur\r\nby far so frequently as Bretonneau had asserted, and croup of the\r\nlarynx without a preceding diphtheria of the pharynx was observed more\r\nfrequently than he would lead us to believe.\r\n\r\nThe various changes in the symptoms of the epidemics of diphtheria\r\nwhich were observed in different places and countries, and at\r\ndifferent times, explain many of the differences of opinions in regard\r\nto the nature of the disease. The literature of that subject is in the\r\nlast twenty-five years simply stupendous, and a few more notes must\r\nsuffice for the elucidation of the drift of theories and observations.\r\nBeale was the first to look for organic beings as the cause of the\r\ndisease, without finding any. Laycock sees it in the bacilli and\r\nspores of oidium albicans; Wilks, however, found the same parasite in\r\nother affections. Cammack declares the diphtheritic membrane to be\r\nherpetic. Feron also calls Bretonneau's mild form of the disease a\r\nherpetic angina with pseudo-membrane; so does Gubler. Bouchut writes\r\nagainst the identity of diphtheria, croup, and gangrene. Condie\r\ndescribes the disease as occurring with scarlatina. Litchfield claims\r\nthat it is a concealed scarlatina, and Hillier that it has some\r\nconnection with it. Millard cites one case in the course of which\r\ngangrene occurred, and another in which skin, mouth, pharynx,\r\nrespiratory passages, oesophagus, and vulva were affected at the same\r\ntime. Harley vainly endeavored to inoculate the disease in animals.\r\nStephens declares the disease to be infectious. Sanderson looks upon\r\nit as identical with the angina maligna of the aged. Farr considered\r\nthe exhalations from sewers an important etiological factor.\r\nSellerier, Kingsford, and Harley (1859) report paralyses as sequelæ.\r\nMaugin speaks of a specific eruption; Ward, of an accompanying\r\npurpura. Bouchut and Empis remarked the frequent presence of and\r\ndanger from albuminuria; so did Wade. Maugin calls attention to the\r\nfact that, when present in diphtheria, it occurs early, whereas in\r\nscarlatina it is seen during the period of desquamation, and is not of\r\nfrequent occurrence even then. Gull gives an account of cases in which\r\ndeath resulted from asthenia, and speaks of a nerve-lesion which he\r\nattributes to the severity of the local inflammation. Hildige\r\ndescribes diphtheritic conjunctivitis as seen in Graefe's practice,\r\nand looks upon it as contagious. Magne denies its contagious or {663}\r\ninfectious character. Mackenzie, while probably having seen false\r\nmembrane appear on the conjunctiva when in a state of inflammation,\r\nyet refuses to recognize diphtheritic conjunctivitis as a distinct\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIn the same degree that observations of cases and epidemics increased\r\nin number, the nature of the disease and its cause commenced to be\r\nstudied. The assumption that the latter was a chemical poison was soon\r\ndoubted, and the parasitic nature of diphtheria considered by many as\r\nproven.\r\n\r\nAfter Henle had (1840) expressed his belief in the existence of a\r\ncontagium animatum, and morbid processes had for some time been\r\ncompared with the phenomena of fermentation, Schwann demonstrated the\r\npresence of lower organisms in fermentation and putrefaction. The\r\ndiscovery of the cause of the silk-worm disease by Bassis, of the\r\nachorion by Schönlein, of the acarus by Simon, of bacteria in\r\nmalignant pustule by Pollender, Brauell, and, above all, by Davaine,\r\nin relapsing fever by Obermeier, the teachings of Pasteur concerning\r\nthe conditions under which putrefaction occurs,--all tended to explain\r\nthe various infectious and contagious diseases by analogy also, and to\r\nstimulate the search for a vegetable organism in diphtheria. Buhl was\r\nthe first to discover schizomycetæ in diphtheritic membrane, but\r\nexpressed no opinion as to the part they played in the process. Hüter\r\nfound them in the gray diphtheritic covering of wounds, in the\r\nsurrounding apparently healthy tissues, and in the blood. Hüter and\r\nTomasi found them in the diphtheritic membranes of the pharynx and\r\nlarynx, inoculated them on the mucous membranes of animals, and\r\ndescribed them as small, round or oval, dark-colored, active little\r\nbodies. The latter observers look upon these organisms as a part of\r\nthe infectious element. Oertel found them in diphtheritic membrane and\r\nin inflamed mucous membranes in the lymphatic vessels, lymphatic\r\nglands, kidneys, and other organs; he considers them as the contagious\r\nelement of diphtheria. Nassiloff, too, after inoculations in the\r\ncornea resulted in an enormous multiplication of the microscopic\r\norganisms and their appearance with pus-cells in the lacteals and in\r\nthe lymphatics of the palate, and even in the bones and cartilages,\r\nasserts that the development of organisms is the primary step in the\r\ndiphtheritic process. Eberth made successful inoculations in living\r\ntissues; the micro-organisms, introduced into the cornea, proliferated\r\nactively and caused an inflammation of irritative character in the\r\nsurrounding tissue. He asserts, with the positiveness of an\r\nevangelist, that diphtheria cannot occur without bacteria. Klebs\r\ninoculated the micrococci in pigeons and dogs, and found them in the\r\nblood of the animals after death. Orth found them in the pleura,\r\nlungs, kidneys, and urinary bladder. But what their action is, whether\r\nthey are directly pernicious, or deprive the body of certain elements\r\n(as of oxygen in malignant pustule, according to Bollinger), or injure\r\nmechanically by acting on the coats of the blood-vessels (either\r\ndirectly or by means of altering the blood), thus depriving whole\r\nterritories of their blood-vessels, is a question upon which the\r\nprincipal advocates of the parasitic theory have not yet agreed. Even\r\nOertel acknowledges the impossibility of explaining the manner in\r\nwhich bacteria act (Ziemssen, _Handbuch_, ii., 1, p. 581, 2d ed.).\r\nThis much is positive, at any rate: that no one has yet proven that\r\nthe vegetable organisms alone, and not other, free or fixed, parts of\r\nthe {664} diphtheritic membrane, are the vehicles of the infecting\r\nelements (Steudener); and even now the question has not been decided\r\nwhether the bacteria met with in diphtheria constitute the cause of\r\nthe disease, or are a part of the process, or co-effects of the\r\npoisonous action--whether they are the carriers of the poison or\r\nentirely indifferent entities.\r\n\r\nThe most important observations made by those who deny a direct\r\netiological connection between micro-organisms and septic diseases in\r\ngeneral, and diphtheria in particular, are those of Hiller and\r\nBillroth. The latter has proven the morphological identity of the\r\nvarious kinds of bacteria, although it cannot be denied that the\r\napparent similarity may mask a yet unknown difference. Hiller calls\r\nattention to the fact that large numbers of micrococci have been found\r\nin the cadaver where death has not been the result of septic disease,\r\nand also that septic infection is not always severest where the\r\nbacteria most abound, but where an extensive chemical decomposition or\r\na mass of putrefying tissue is found. This would indicate that the\r\nseptic process is rather dependent on chemical decomposition than on\r\nthe presence of bacteria.\r\n\r\nPanum, Bergmann, and Schmiedeberg have isolated poisons that contained\r\nno bacteria. Rawitsch and many others prove that septic infection is\r\nnot dependent on the existence of bacteria. Davaine has shown that an\r\ninfinitely small amount of a chemical poison, free from bacteria, can\r\nkill quickly.\r\n\r\nThe presence of cocco-bacteria (Billroth) in the blood during life has\r\nnot once been proven, not even in pyæmia or septicæmia. Yet their\r\nbeing swept into the lungs with the atmospheric air is indisputable.\r\nIt would therefore seem as though living blood had a greater tendency\r\nto destroy bacteria than to allow itself to be decomposed by them. Not\r\nonly, however, would it seem so, but P. Grawitz (_Virch. Arch._, vol.\r\nlxx., p. 546) proves that sporules do not grow in the (tissue and)\r\nblood, but that they are in part dissolved, in part eliminated through\r\nthe kidneys, and that this result is accomplished through the\r\ncombination of the following four factors--viz. the elasticity of the\r\nblood, its constant motion, the absence of oxygen in sufficient\r\nquantity in the circulating blood, and the presence of living animal\r\ncells. All of these factors appear to be of great importance. Thus it\r\nis that, where the constant motion of the blood and the animal living\r\ncells are not present (as in the anterior chamber of the eye or in the\r\nhumor vitreous) a rapid proliferation and accumulation of bacteria can\r\ntake place. They are also known to increase rapidly and emigrate into\r\nthe liver when deposited in the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of bacteria in the circulating blood, into which they\r\nmay have penetrated, accounts for some microscopical facts in\r\nconnection with (actually or apparently morbid) blood. Their remnants\r\nare probably the pale and dark particles which are discovered in the\r\nblood alongside the red and white blood-corpuscles. They could not be\r\nidentified as micrococci, while in the tissue they are more\r\nrecognizable. In autopsies they have been found in the urinary\r\ntubules, pressing forward and piercing the walls, not occupying a\r\nnidus of inflammation, however, and probably are even here a\r\npost-mortem phenomenon. A direct necrosis or inflammation by the\r\ninoculation of diphtheritic elements can only be produced in the\r\ncornea, as was shown by Recklinghausen, and particularly Eberth.\r\nBesides, there is nothing characteristic in the cocco-bacteria of\r\n{665} diphtheria, with the exception, perhaps, of their browner color,\r\nto justify their being looked upon as a distinct variety, certainly\r\nnot as another species. It is more likely that a difference of action\r\nis not so much to be sought for in a different parasite as in the\r\npeculiarity of the corneal tissue. When fluid containing\r\ncocco-bacteria was injected into the eye of a rabbit, in twenty-four\r\nhours the eye was destroyed. If injected into the eye of a dog or\r\nguinea-pig, only a slight inflammation resulted (Billroth and\r\nEhrlich). If these experiments were continued on a larger scale, we\r\nmight eventually, by analogy, infer, and even prove, that the immunity\r\nagainst certain diseases enjoyed by some animals is owing to\r\npeculiarities in the very structure of their own tissues. In a similar\r\nmanner I shall prove hereafter that even peculiarities and variations\r\nin the tissue and epithelium of the human body give rise to different\r\nshades and variable clinical symptoms in the diphtheritic processes.\r\n\r\nThe views of Curtis, Satterthwaite, and Charlton Bastian fully agree\r\nwith those of the above observers. The latter is rather inclined to\r\nlook upon bacteria as an effect of the disease than as a cause.\r\nSimilar views were expressed by Burdon Sanderson.\r\n\r\nNor are the researches of Weissgerber and Terls, Lukomsky, Weigert,\r\nLücke, any more conclusive; and, finally, Fürbringer, in his most\r\nrecent and careful studies of diphtheritic nephritis, insists upon\r\nthis, that it is not caused by immigration of fungi into the kidneys,\r\nthat the very best methods employed for the finding of parasites\r\nresult in the absence of micrococci from the inflamed organ, and that\r\nthe renal inflammation following diphtheria is the result of a\r\nchemical process.\r\n\r\nH. C. Wood and Henry F. Formad, in Supplement 7 of the _National Board\r\nof Health Bulletin_ (1880), declare it altogether improbable that\r\nbacteria have any direct function in diphtheria--_i.e._ that they\r\nenter the system as bacteria and develop as such in the system, and\r\ncause the symptoms. It is, however, possible that they may act upon\r\nthe exudations of the trachea as the yeast-plant acts upon sugar, and\r\ncause the production of a septic poison which differs from that of\r\nordinary putrefaction, and bears such relations to the system as to,\r\nwhen absorbed, cause the systemic symptoms of diphtheria. Now, these\r\nbacteria may be always in the air, but not in sufficient quantities to\r\ncause tracheitis, but enough when lodged in the membrane to set up the\r\npeculiar fermentation; whilst during an epidemic they may be\r\nsufficiently numerous to incite an inflammation in a previously\r\nhealthy throat.\r\n\r\nThe same authors publish a number of other experiments and conclusions\r\nin Suppl. 17 (Jan., 1882): \"There is no proof as yet that the\r\nmicrococci are the cause of the disease. Their presence in the exposed\r\ndead tissue is no evidence, for the membrane represents but the\r\nnecrotic mucous lining.... Indeed, when the healthy mucous membrane of\r\nthe mouth or trachea is destroyed by caustics--for instance,\r\nammonia--the eschar into which it is converted--really a\r\npseudo-membrane--contains the same micrococci as are found in true\r\ndiphtheria, as Wood and Formad have learned. Moreover, in the\r\nscrapings of the healthy tongue the same micrococci can be seen. Of\r\nmore significance is the detection of the same or similar micrococci\r\nin the blood of the living patients during severe attacks. But since\r\nthese parasites were found only in the more severe cases, and not in\r\nall instances of the disease, were seen also {666} in the blood of\r\nother septic disorders, and since no cultures have been made with the\r\nfresh blood, there is not yet enough evidence for any decision. In the\r\ninternal organs bacteria are not found with any regularity in\r\ndiphtheria.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: H. Gradle, _Bacteria and the Germ Theory of Disease_,\r\nChicago, 1883, p. 186.]\r\n\r\nO. Heubner, while studying both the local affection and the general\r\ninfection of diphtheria, availed himself of the methods of Cohnheim\r\nand Litten, who produced diphtheritic deposits by cutting off the\r\ncirculation of the blood. He ligated the neck of the bladder in\r\nrabbits for two hours. On the first day he noticed a hemorrhagic\r\noedema of the mucous membrane, with loosened and tumefied epithelium;\r\non the second a firm and coagulated exudation took the place of the\r\nnormal tissue; on the third there were genuine diphtheritic spots in\r\nthe mucous membrane. The newly-formed pseudo-membrane exhibited all\r\nthe morphological elements of human diphtheria (genuine or\r\nscarlatinous) and epidemic dysentery.[7] Thus Heubner's results agree\r\nwith the definition of diphtheria as the compound of severe\r\ninflammation and necrosis. The inoculation of his diphtheritic\r\nartefacts he found sterile. Animals, however, which were inoculated\r\nwith diphtheritic masses taken from the diseased human patient fell\r\nsick with tumor of the spleen, hemorrhages, and general sepsis,\r\nbesides a local diphtheritic affection. Scarlatinal diphtheria used\r\nfor the same purpose had the same effect. Bacilli were developed, but\r\nthey were not found in the blood-vessels (differing in that respect\r\nfrom the bacilli of anthrax), in spite of continued examination. Thus,\r\nHeubner refuses to accept the bacilli as the diphtheritic poison; they\r\nare, in his opinion, the result of the morbid process, and not its\r\ncause. Thus, though he believes the diphtheria poison to be organic,\r\nhe concludes that its nature is not yet explained; contrary to the\r\nassertions of many prolific prophets of the bacteria literature, who\r\nnow and then claim for this year's microscopic revelations the same\r\ninfallibility which was claimed for last year's opposite views.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Die Experimentelle Diphtherie_, Leipzig, 1883.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: L. Letzerich recognized in former years the specific\r\nparasites of diphtheria, whooping cough, and typhoid fever as if they\r\nwere labelled. Then, again (_Arch. f. Experim. Pathol. u.\r\nPharmacol._), he admitted the great difficulty in discriminating the\r\nspecific schizomycetæ of diphtheria, croupous pneumonia, epidemic\r\ninfluenza, and typhoid fever.]\r\n\r\nE. Rindfleisch[9] expresses himself as follows: \"The microphytes of\r\ndiphtheria, septicæmia, and pyæmia have not been isolated and\r\ncultivated as yet. But experimenters are convinced that there are a\r\ngreat many species of microphytes underlying genuine putrefaction. In\r\nproducing septicæmic conditions in animals their efficacy differs. Not\r\nevery animal is influenced by the same microphyte. Thus it becomes\r\nprobable that the human organism is endangered by a certain number of\r\nthe putrefaction microphytes. Some one may have a particular\r\npredilection for granulating wounds and mucous membranes, and thereby\r\nproduce a diphtheritic inflammation. Another may enter the blood from\r\na recent wound and give rise to a septicæmic fever with rapidly fatal\r\ntermination. The third may invade the body by means of a phlegmonous\r\ninflammation, purulent infiltration, thrombosis, embolism, and\r\nmetastatic abscesses, accompanied with a pyæmic fever of a remittent\r\ntype.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Die Elemente der Pathologie_, Leipzig, 1883, p. 301.]\r\n\r\nAfter all, it does not appear to me that the bacteria question has\r\ncome {667} any nearer its solution in the last few years, in spite of\r\nthe most eager researches and the fact that some of the best medical\r\nnames in the world of medicine take the parasitic nature of diphtheria\r\nfor granted. For instance, in the second Congress for Internal\r\nMedicine (Wiesbaden, 1883) C. Gerhardt rises in its favor. He makes\r\nthe statement, or rather admits, that several parasites have been\r\nfound by different men, that every one considers his the genuine one,\r\nthat several writers assume that there are several diphtheria\r\nparasites, and suggests that, in his opinion, the disease may be\r\nproduced by different varieties of bacteria. At the same time, he\r\ncontends that the essence of the disease consists in the erosion (and\r\nchange) of the epithelium and the emigration of leucocytes. If that be\r\nthe case, I understand less than ever why diphtheria is, or is to be\r\ncalled, a parasitic disease.\r\n\r\nPanum's words seem still to be the soundest expression of all our\r\nknowledge on the subject when he says: \"It is a matter of rejoicing\r\nthat physicians have come to the conclusion that certain microscopic\r\norganisms, be they considered vegetable or animal, and designated as\r\nbacteria, fungi, monads, micrococci, or vibriones, do not exist merely\r\nin the minds of theorists as causes of disease, but are in reality\r\nenemies that must be combated with all the known efficient weapons in\r\nour possession. But, while thus rejoicing, it must be borne in mind\r\nthat we have but a feeble insight into the relation between these\r\norganisms and diseases, and in order to effect that much-desired\r\nadvance in scientific knowledge--a matter of considerable importance\r\nin the practice of medicine--it is necessary not only to grasp at\r\nisolated data, but carefully and deliberately to observe and study all\r\nthe facts before us, and even to devote some attention to those which\r\nwould tend to prove that there are bacteria and fungi which, under\r\ncertain circumstances, are perfectly harmless, and that even some of\r\nthe malignant ones among them do not commit all those outrages with\r\nwhich they are charged, directly and personally.\"\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--In the majority of cases the disease has a prodromal stage,\r\nwhich usually lasts a day or two, and may run a similar course to that\r\nof a catarrhal pharyngitis. The patient feels somewhat indisposed, has\r\nslight fever, is dejected, complains of painful deglutition, more\r\nmarked when swallowing fluids than solids or semi-solids, has headache\r\nand occasionally vomiting. The occurrence of the latter, however, is\r\nvery much less frequent than in the outbreak of scarlatina. In very\r\nsevere cases convulsions have been observed, chills very rarely;\r\nelevations of temperature of from 102.5° to 104° F. are frequent;\r\nhigher ones, from 105° to 107°, rare. At this time it is often\r\ndifficult or impossible to distinguish a catarrhal angina from a\r\ndiphtheritic by the subjective symptoms. Slight glandular swellings\r\nunder the jaw may occur in either. The characteristic objective\r\nsymptom of the latter disease is the presence of membrane on the\r\nreddened mucous membrane of the fauces, which, usually, is markedly\r\ninjected over all or part of the surface. The arches of the palate and\r\nthe tonsils, less frequently the posterior wall of the pharynx, are so\r\naffected. A distinctly localized redness cannot be but either\r\ntraumatic or diphtheritic. Larger or smaller deposits are found\r\nthereon, lying loose on the surface or deeply imbedded according to\r\nthe locality. At times the first examination reveals their presence in\r\nlarge numbers; at other times but a single one can be {668} detected,\r\nwhich is soon followed by others, however. Within a certain period of\r\ntime, as a rule twenty to twenty-four hours, the single deposits\r\ncoalesce and form a membrane of greater or less extent. Mostly in the\r\nsame proportion to its increase in size it increases in thickness. On\r\nthe uvula, soft palate, and the posterior wall of the pharynx the\r\nmembrane is located superficially, and at times can be easily removed;\r\non the tonsils it has a firmer hold, and is usually amalgamated with\r\ntheir uppermost tissues. On the other hand, there are cases in which\r\nno actual membranous formation is observed; in such cases the tissues\r\nare more or less swollen, the surrounding portions more or less\r\nreddened, and the grayish-white discoloration is the result of an\r\ninfiltration of the tissues themselves, and cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nThere are still other cases in which deposits of membrane and tissue\r\ninfiltration are found at the same time, and where both history and\r\nevidence indicate that these two phenomena are the result of one and\r\nthe same process. When the uvula takes part in the process the\r\nswelling is, as a rule, more marked than when the remaining parts of\r\nthe fauces only are implicated. Its circumference is very\r\nconsiderable, and amounts sometimes to the treble or quadruple of the\r\nnormal, in consequence of the oedematous condition of the entire\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nWe have to deal, then, with three different manifestations of the\r\ndiphtheritic process: first, with a membrane lying on the mucous\r\nmembrane, and removable without causing much injury to the epithelium\r\nor any to the basement membrane; such membranes were given by some the\r\nname of croupous deposits; secondly, with a membrane implicating the\r\nepithelium and upper layers of the mucous membrane; to this the title\r\nof diphtheritic membrane has been given by preference; thirdly, with a\r\nwhitish or grayish infiltration of the surface and the deeper tissue,\r\nwhich, if abundant, may give rise to a necrotic destruction of the\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nThe severity of the disease does not always depend on the predominance\r\nof one of these three forms, for any of them may accompany a mild or a\r\nsevere attack. By a severe attack we understand one attended with\r\nchills, temperatures as high as 105° and 107° F., and marked nervous\r\nsymptoms, such as vomiting and convulsions. It is characteristic of\r\nsuch cases that when the membrane is accidentally or forcibly removed\r\nit is speedily reproduced; the lymphatic system, in addition, takes an\r\nactive part in the process. The neighboring glands become swollen; the\r\nperiglandular tissue does likewise, so that the circumference of the\r\nneck becomes enormous, and the space between the lower jaw and the\r\nclavicle appears one immense tumefaction. These are the cases in\r\nwhich, as a rule, loss of strength and general debility speedily\r\nensue, and death occurs from exhaustion. The membrane in cases of this\r\ndescription frequently undergoes changes in appearance; under the\r\ninfluence of the atmosphere and of foreign substances, and by\r\nadmixture of blood, its color becomes yellowish or brownish. The odor\r\nof the membrane and surrounding parts becomes sweetish and musty, and\r\noccasionally so fetid that it contaminates the atmosphere of the room,\r\nand the air in its transit through the nose and over the pharynx\r\nbecomes by inhalation dangerous to the patient. His throat becomes\r\nmore swollen, his respiration loud; he keeps his mouth open\r\nconstantly, has an indifferent expression; the saliva dribbles\r\ncontinually, the color of the skin is sallow and livid, the {669}\r\nappetite very poor, and pulse both frequent and small. When the\r\nsymptoms are of long duration, and a deep infiltration of the affected\r\nparts occurs, hemorrhages not infrequently make their appearance.\r\nThese may be slight although frequent; occasionally, however, larger\r\nblood-vessels are encroached upon in the process of destruction, and\r\ndangerous, nay even fatal, hemorrhages may be the result. The septic\r\nforms which I have here described are more dangerous than the mild\r\nones previously mentioned. Still, even in the latter bad results may\r\nensue from a direct absorption into the blood of putrid substances and\r\nby the penetration of fetid gases to the lungs.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, where the infiltration has been extensive, we meet with\r\na condition that can only be considered as gangrene. In such cases we\r\nsee collections of a grayish pulpy mass, which on falling off leaves a\r\nconsiderable loss of tissue, the further course of the disease being\r\neither favorable, or dangerous through absorption of septic material,\r\nor accompanied by local hemorrhages. When, after a time, health is\r\ncompletely restored, marked cicatrices are left behind. Such loss of\r\ntissue is generally seen in the tonsils only, but it may also be\r\nencountered in the soft palate. Its cicatrices on the soft palate are\r\nalways a source of inconvenience, partly in swallowing, partly in\r\nspeaking. Actual local perforation of the soft palate I have seen but\r\nfive times in twenty-five years, sloughing without perforation very\r\noften.\r\n\r\nThe diphtheritic membrane not infrequently spreads from the pharynx to\r\nthe neighboring organs. From the posterior aspect of the soft palate\r\nor pharynx the disease gradually ascends to the nasal cavities; this\r\nis particularly apt to occur when the uvula is the seat of extensive\r\ndeposits, and by forced inspiration and deglutition its posterior\r\nsurface becomes affected. In such cases the membrane which extends\r\nthence to the nasal cavities is very dense, and capable of narrowing\r\nthe capacity of the nasal cavities anteriorly, and occasionally even\r\nto close them entirely; as a rule, however, several days elapse before\r\nthe membrane assumes such a condition. Usually, when this form of\r\nnasal diphtheria is in its incipient stage, it is impossible to\r\ndiagnosticate it; the most important sign thereof, besides a more\r\nnasal articulation and sometimes greater difficulty in deglutition,\r\nand the result of close ocular examination while the uvula is turned\r\nsideways or drawn forward, is a swelling of the deep facial glands at\r\nthe angle of the lower jaw; when these swell rapidly it can be\r\nasserted positively that the nasal cavities have been invaded. There\r\nis little or no discharge from the nostrils under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe picture is a very different one, however, when the nose becomes\r\nprimarily affected. This usually occurs only where an acute catarrh\r\nwith but little secretion, not so often where a chronic catarrh, has\r\npreceded infection. When the secretion is thin and serous, the\r\ndiphtheritic infection renders it no thicker, but makes it slightly\r\nflocculent, and it may become very profuse. This form is frequently\r\nattended with a disagreeable odor, equally unpleasant to the patient\r\nand to those around him. During the prevalence of an epidemic one must\r\nalways be prepared to see an acute nasal catarrh or an influenza, or\r\neven a chronic nasal catarrh, become complicated with diphtheria or\r\npass into it. Schuller reports the case of a five-weeks-old male child\r\nwho, having had a nasal catarrh since birth, became affected with\r\ndiphtheria of the nose. The glandular {670} swelling of which I spoke\r\nabove is a very important diagnostic, and likewise a decidedly\r\nunpleasant symptom, which becomes very marked inside of twenty-four\r\nhours; frequently a partial swelling remains long after the\r\ndisappearance of the diphtheritic membrane. Such glands rarely\r\nsuppurate or undergo a necrotic degeneration; sometimes they become\r\npermanently indurated. This induration and a chronic pharyngeal and\r\nnasal catarrh are very serious matters in many instances. Both of\r\nthese conditions are starting-points for a number of acute or subacute\r\nattacks of diphtheria in the same person. It is they which constitute\r\nthe liability of persons once affected to be taken sick again. Not\r\nonly are they liable to be affected themselves, but they are a\r\nconstant danger to all around them. Diphtheria, in a large family of\r\nchildren living in one of the best houses of the city, after having\r\nreturned half a dozen times in the course of a year, disappeared\r\ninstantaneously, not to return, when a seamstress living in an\r\ninfected neighborhood and suffering from occasional sore throats was\r\nrelieved of her daily work in the house. Oedematous swelling of the\r\nmucous membrane and submucous tissue is often observed for a long\r\nperiod to come; elongated uvulæ, enlarged tonsils, often date back to\r\nsuch an acute attack. Thus it is with the upper portion of the larynx\r\nabout the posterior insertion of the vocal cords (see below); its\r\nlarge amount of loose submucous tissue is liable to swell considerably\r\nin acute attacks. Frequent spells of croupy cough and a certain degree\r\nof dyspnoea are often observed for years afterward. Though the cases\r\nof genuine cicatrization between the arytenoid cartilages, as\r\ndescribed by Michael,[10] be rare, with their result of permanent\r\nparesis of the thyroarytenoid interni muscles, when they do occur they\r\nare either obstinate or altogether incurable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, 1879, xxiv. p. 618.]\r\n\r\nDiphtheritic conjunctivitis occurs either primarily or as a\r\ncomplication of pharyngeal or nasal diphtheria. Fortunately, it is not\r\nof frequent occurrence; the cornea may become destroyed either by\r\npressure through the considerable swelling of the eyelid or by\r\ndiphtheritic keratitis. Usually the upper eyelid is the first to\r\nsuffer; it is red, rigid, swollen. In the beginning the conjunctiva\r\npalpebræ is smooth, dry and pale, while that of the eye is chemosed;\r\nafterward diphtheritic deposits take place either in floccules or in\r\nsolid masses. Knapp distinguishes between croup and diphtheria of the\r\neyelid according to the facility or impossibility of removing the\r\ndeposit. In favorable cases the membranes begin to macerate and the\r\neyelids to soften after a few days. In those less favorable\r\nperforation of the cornea, prolapse of the iris, or total destruction\r\nof the eye take place.\r\n\r\nThe ear is but rarely the primary seat of diphtheria. A girl of three\r\nyears died of laryngeal diphtheria on Sept. 6, 1882, after an illness\r\nof four days. A girl of seven years was removed from the house on\r\nSept. 6th and returned on Sept. 8th. On the afternoon of the 10th an\r\nearring taken from the corpse was attached to the left ear of the\r\nsister, after having been washed with soap and water only. About noon\r\non the 11th the lobe of the left ear reddened, on the 12th it\r\nexhibited a membrane and became swollen, and some glands enlarged in\r\nthe neighborhood. On the right mastoid process the skin was not quite\r\nhealthy, a vesicatory having been applied three weeks previously. This\r\nsurface became {671} diphtheritic on the 12th, without consecutive\r\nglandular swelling. On the 13th the membranes grew thicker; on the\r\n14th the pharynx was also affected, and the physician called in.\r\n\r\nMost diphtheritic affections of the ear, however, are secondary. In\r\npharyngeal and nasal diphtheria the narrow orifice of the Eustachian\r\ntube is easily obstructed by either catarrhal swelling or diphtheritic\r\ndeposit. The disease may invade the middle ear and the drum membrane\r\nwith perforation, caries, and deafness following.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the diphtheritic process into the respiratory organs\r\nmay give rise to various conditions. The membrane is not always found\r\nto pass uninterruptedly from the mucous membrane of the fauces into\r\nthe larynx; not infrequently isolated diphtheritic spots are found in\r\nthe pouches on either side of the attached extremity of the\r\nepiglottis, or on the epiglottis, or in the larynx. At such times the\r\nepiglottis is moderately swollen, its margins hard and reddened.\r\nOccasionally the redness is interrupted by small diphtheritic\r\ndeposits, which may remain isolated for a considerable time, but\r\ngenerally coalesce so as to coat the edges of the epiglottis with a\r\ncontinuous membrane. As a rule, the upper surface of the epiglottis is\r\nnot completely covered by membrane, while only now and then\r\ndiphtheritic deposits are found on its under surface.\r\n\r\nThe subjective symptoms accompanying the affection of the epiglottis\r\nare not always in direct proportion to the extent of the membranes.\r\nDyspnoea and hoarseness occasionally occur where the only abnormal\r\ncondition is a marked oedema at the entrance of the larynx,\r\nparticularly of the posterior wall near the arytenoid cartilages and\r\nthe attachment of the vocal cords. The oedematous condition causes a\r\nfunctional paralysis of the vocal cords, together with marked dyspnoea\r\non inspiration. The difficulty of breathing may become so excessive\r\nthat the clinical diagnosis of croup is unquestionable, and\r\ntracheotomy resorted to, while expiration is comparatively free and\r\nthe voice not markedly affected. Furthermore, cases occur in which\r\nthere is no marked oedema, but merely a general catarrh of the\r\nepiglottis and larynx; here, too, the subjective symptoms of\r\nhoarseness and dyspnoea may become severe and necessitate the\r\nperformance of tracheotomy. Still, bearing this in mind, I have on\r\nseveral occasions refrained from performing this operation where I\r\njudged that, aside from the diphtheria of the pharynx, I had to deal\r\nwith a moderate oedema of the glottis or a laryngeal catarrh.\r\n\r\nFrequently, however, membranes form in the larynx in the same way as\r\nin the pharynx or nose; then inspiration and expiration are equally\r\ninterfered with, and hoarseness is a more constant symptom than in the\r\nabove-mentioned cases. Fever and pain are not necessarily prominent\r\nsymptoms; in fact, they are frequently unimportant, but in proportion\r\nas the degree of narrowing of the larynx increases the respiration\r\nbecomes more difficult, long-drawn, and loud.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that the trachea and bronchi may become affected,\r\nalthough diphtheria of the fauces does not exist. This does not occur\r\nas rarely as Henoch and Oertel seem to believe. They think that\r\ndiphtheritic tracheo-bronchitis is mistaken for the primary condition,\r\nbecause the throat is not examined early enough.\r\n\r\nOertel is of the opinion that the membrane in the fauces is {672}\r\noverlooked in such cases. Steiner,[11] too, asserts that \"the tendency\r\nof the times is to question, nay, rather to deny, the existence of\r\ncroup extending from below upward.\" Now, on the contrary, repeated\r\nexperience enables me to assert with positiveness that diphtheritic\r\ntracheo-bronchitis may occur without an affection of the pharynx at\r\nthe same time. I do not deny that it may last for days without giving\r\nrise to dangerous symptoms. I know it does. But when the process\r\nreaches the larynx, the symptoms of suffocation become so urgent that\r\ntracheotomy may be absolutely required at once, and, in spite of the\r\noperation, death soon after occurs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Ziemssen's Handb._, iv., 1, 126.]\r\n\r\nOf course these cases are exceptions; as a rule, laryngeal and\r\ntracheal diphtheria result from a descent of the disease from the\r\nfauces. More or less uncomplicated cases of primary laryngeal\r\ndiphtheria, or so-called sporadic membranous croup, were, however,\r\nobserved before the end of the sixth decade of this century. They were\r\nthen almost the only cases of diphtheria, and linked former epidemics\r\nand the present one together.\r\n\r\nInflammatory affections of the lungs may occur at various times and in\r\nvarious forms during an attack of diphtheria. That which appears after\r\ntracheotomy is usually a broncho-pneumonia, and results from\r\nrarefaction of the air in the respiratory passages during the period\r\nof impeded respiration, with consequent collapse of pulmonary tissue\r\nand dilatation of the blood-vessels, and hence a disturbance of the\r\ncirculation. It may not fully develop until after tracheotomy, and is\r\na frequent cause of death on the second or third day after the\r\noperation. Now and then a case of lobular pneumonia will result from\r\nthe aspiration of pieces of membranes into the smallest bronchi. It\r\ncan be easily recognized when the trachea is opened, but previous to\r\nthe operation the auscultatory signs are of little or no value, being\r\nmasked by the laryngeal râles. Percussion is equally useless, for a\r\ndulness may just as well indicate collapse of the lung as\r\ninfiltration. The second form of pneumonia associated with diphtheria\r\nis from the beginning fibrinous in character. Here, too, auscultation\r\nand percussion are of little assistance in establishing a diagnosis\r\nwhen there is a laryngeal diphtheria at the same time, for the above\r\nreasons. Where, however, the dulness on percussion is accompanied by\r\nhigh fever, and the long-drawn inspiration is replaced by rapid\r\nrespiratory movements, the diagnosis of pneumonic complication is\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria of the mouth, as a primary affection, is not of very\r\nfrequent occurrence; not rarely, however, is it associated with\r\ndiphtheria of the fauces and nose, mainly when they have assumed a\r\nseptic or gangrenous character; it appears on cheeks, tongue, angles\r\nof the mouth and gums, and, after the fetid discharges have excoriated\r\nthe skin, on the lips also. In all of these localities it appears less\r\nin the form of an extensive, thick membrane than an infiltration of\r\nthe tissues. It is most apt to occur where, from the start, the mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth was eroded or ulcerated. The ulcerated base of a\r\nfollicular stomatitis is very frequently the starting-point of a\r\ngeneral diphtheria of the mouth. It is always a disagreeable symptom,\r\npoints to a long duration of the whole process, and threatens septic\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nThe oesophagus and the cardiac portion of the stomach are the seat\r\n{673} sometimes of very massive and extensive, mostly fibrinous\r\nexudations, in typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, measles, and\r\nscarlatina, or after injuries following contact with mineral acids,\r\nalkalies, corrosive sublimate, or antimony. When the normal tissue was\r\nnot injured I never saw any that were not superjacent and could not\r\neasily be peeled off (croupous). In cases of extensive pharyngeal and\r\nlaryngeal diphtheria the upper part of the oesophagus is often covered\r\nto a distance of half an inch or an inch with membrane, the lower part\r\nof which is thinning out into a mere film. A case of local\r\ndiphtheritic deposit near the cardiac portions of the oesophagus, upon\r\nthe seat of a stricture, I have described in my _Treatise_, p. 83.\r\nActual diphtheria of the stomach is rare. So is that of the intestine,\r\nwhich is much more liable to be affected in animals than in man. In\r\nthe cow intestinal diphtheria is frequent (Bollinger). In the\r\ngall-bladder, resulting from the irritation produced by calculus, it\r\nwas seen by Weisserfels. The diphtheritic form of inflammation of the\r\nhuman colon and rectum--dysentery--is frequent enough, but will be the\r\nsubject of discussion in another place. But, besides this, in the\r\nlower portion of the small intestines and in the colon long, tough,\r\ncoherent membranes are sometimes found in the male and female (not in\r\nthe hysterical female only). As a rule they are not diphtheritic, but\r\nconsist mostly of nothing but mucus hardened and flattened down by\r\nprotracted compression. The few cases of intestinal diphtheria I have\r\nmet with gave rise to the usual symptoms of enteritis, and were\r\ndiagnosticated as such.\r\n\r\nWounds of all kinds are easily and rapidly infected by diphtheria; for\r\ninstance, vaginal abrasions and erosions of the external ear, tongue,\r\nand corners of the mouth. Scarification or removal of part of the\r\ntonsils is followed in half a day or a day by a deposit of\r\ndiphtheritic membrane on the wound. The wound caused by tracheotomy\r\nbecomes liable to be infected with diphtheria within twenty-four\r\nhours. Leech-bites, skin denuded by vesicatories, removal of the\r\ncuticle by scratching during cutaneous eruptions, all furnish a\r\nresting-place for diphtheria in a short time. What Billroth has\r\ndescribed under the name of muco-salivary diphtheritis, as it occurs\r\nafter the extirpation of a large portion of the tongue and resection\r\nof the lower jaw, belongs to this class.\r\n\r\nAt times immediately at the beginning of an invasion of diphtheria, at\r\nother times only on the second or third day, an erythematous eruption,\r\nmore or less general, appears on the skin. Now and then it appears on\r\nthe chest, shoulders, and back; at other times it covers the body, and\r\nhas not infrequently led to its being confounded with scarlatina. It\r\nis not always accompanied by much fever, and cannot therefore be\r\nmistaken for that form of erythema which frequently appears in\r\nchildren with delicate skins during high fever from any source. I\r\ncannot say that I have found this complication to give a more\r\nmalignant character to the disease, but true erysipelas does. I am not\r\nprepared to prove that the two processes, erysipelas and diphtheria,\r\nare identical under some circumstances, but the complication of the\r\ntwo, and the ferocity with which they combine, renders a close\r\nrelationship probable. I have seen an infant dying from an erysipelas\r\nadded to a post-auricular diphtheria, this being due to a slight\r\nabrasion of the surface. Erysipelas originating in the tracheotomy\r\nwound, though ever so carefully disinfected and secured, is {674}\r\nfrequently observed after two or three days, and is a very ominous\r\nsymptom. Erysipelatous surfaces, denuded of their epidermis by\r\nspontaneous vesication or injured by ever so slight a trauma, are very\r\nliable to be covered with diphtheritic membranes.\r\n\r\nAn eruption resembling urticaria in the beginning is as innocent as\r\nerythema, but purpura in the latter stage is a symptom of mostly\r\nominous nature.\r\n\r\nOn the vulva and vagina of little girls diphtheria is sometimes met\r\nwith; probably in every case it is due, under the epidemic influence,\r\nto a local catarrh or erosion. In but few cases, comparatively, the\r\ninguinal glands are swollen. There are not many cases of vaginal\r\ndiphtheria which are followed by the pharyngeal affection. Diphtheria\r\nof the vagina in puerperal women is liable to become the cause of\r\ngeneral sepsis, and is a dangerous disease; it is seldom complicated,\r\nbut uterus, Fallopian tubes, and peritoneum may become the seat of\r\ninflammatory and septic disturbances. In the bladder it may occur when\r\nthe urine is alkaline, in chronic cystitis, after lithotomy,\r\nurethotomy, the operation for vesico-vaginal fistula, and in ectopia\r\nvesicæ. This form has a marked tendency toward localization, but by\r\nextension of the phlegmon, when of putrid character, to the\r\nretro-peritoneal cellular tissue, peritonitis may ensue and terminate\r\nfatally. Sepsis from absorption is also frequent. Vesical diphtheria\r\nis sometimes quite unsuspected. A man of sixty had urinary trouble a\r\nlong time; his urine was frequently very offensive, containing blood\r\nand pus. About five days before his death he suddenly collapsed. I\r\nfound the bladder well filled, and introduced a catheter, but\r\nsucceeded in removing but a few drops of fetid liquid. Assuming the\r\npresence of a malignant tumor at the neck of the bladder, I attempted\r\nto draw off the urine by puncturing above the symphisis pubis; again\r\nwithout success. At the post-mortem examination a thick membranous\r\nlining of the bladder was found detached in the form of a sac\r\ncontaining about a quart of urine. During life the beak of the\r\ncatheter evidently passed into the space between the bladder and the\r\nmembranous sac, which accounts for the unsuccessful attempts at\r\ncatheterization.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria of the placenta was observed by Schüller. The membrane was\r\nbetween uterus and placenta, and attached to the latter. It resulted\r\nfrom puerperal sepsis. Balano-posthitis is liable to result in local\r\nand general diphtheria; so are circumcision wounds. They are apt to\r\nbecome affected either primarily, without apparent cause, or when\r\nother members of the family are suffering from the disease.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys may become affected in various ways. Albuminuria is not\r\nalways of significance, as it occurs in severe and mild cases alike,\r\nboth before and after tracheotomy, and therefore is not connected\r\nalways either with the height of the fever or the degree of dyspnoea;\r\nat times it disappears in a few days, in other cases it is of longer\r\nduration. It is not invariably complicated with changes in the kidney,\r\nneither do we always discover casts or degenerated epithelial cells in\r\nthe urine. In other respects also it does not behave like albuminuria\r\nin scarlatina. In the latter it appears seldom before the second week\r\nof the process, and frequently later, while in diphtheria it is often\r\nseen early. It sometimes lasts but a few days, particularly in many\r\ncases which set in with a high fever, which rapidly diminishes, and\r\nterminates in speedy recovery. In {675} these occurrences the presence\r\nof albumen appears to attend the rapid elimination of the poison.\r\n\r\nAlbuminuria seldom lasts longer than a week, and is not often\r\ncomplicated with oedema, but sometimes it is but a symptom of a local\r\nor general nephritis, and then hyaline, epithelial, and fibrin casts\r\nand granular cells are found in the urine. Nephritis then assumes as\r\nserious a character as it possesses in scarlatina. Cases of nephritis,\r\nfortunately rare in a very early period of diphtheria, are liable to\r\nrun a rapid and often fatal course.\r\n\r\nThe heart and blood are affected in various ways by the diphtheritic\r\nprocess. Where the disease runs a slow course, accompanied by high\r\nfever, a granular degeneration occurs, similar to that appearing in\r\nother acute infectious disorders--typhoid, for example. In diphtheria,\r\nhowever, it would seem that this condition may arise even without\r\nmarked elevation of temperature. The pathological changes in the heart\r\nproduced by diphtheria are not always the same. Ecchymoses, cellular\r\nhypertrophy, and granular degeneration have frequently been noticed\r\nafter death where the symptoms had been severe. The result, of course,\r\nis considerable weakness of its muscular tissue, evidenced by the\r\nformation of local (Beverly Robinson) thrombi, general sluggishness of\r\nthe circulation, dyspnoea, muffled heart-sounds, a cool and pale skin,\r\nand sudden death, preceded by a very feeble and frequent, sometimes,\r\nhowever, by a very slow, pulse. Aside from this, there is actual\r\nendocarditis during the course of diphtheria or convalescence\r\ntherefrom. It affects especially the valves, and among them\r\nparticularly the mitral. It is characterized by high fever, precordial\r\npain, attacks of syncope, and a systolic murmur.\r\n\r\nThe rapid decrease of red blood-cells and a moderate increase of\r\nleucocytes were demonstrated by Bouchut and Dubrisay, but the\r\ndisproportion was not such as to necessitate the diagnosis of\r\nleucocythæmia. Wunderlich reports two cases of Hodgkin's disease, the\r\npseudo-leukæmia developing during diphtheria. And the slowness of\r\nfinal recovery in many cases, even of but short duration and not\r\ncomplicated with nervous disorders, appears to point to a serious\r\ndisintegration of the elements of the blood. The dark color and\r\ndefective coagulation of the blood in autopsies of diphtheria cases\r\nhave often been remarked.\r\n\r\nThe direct and rapid introduction into the blood of a foreign\r\nsubstance has amongst its earliest symptoms fever. This reaction of a\r\nnervous system depends both on the quantity and quality of the\r\nsubstance or poison introduced, and on the susceptibility of the\r\npatient. High temperatures are, however, not the only, nor are they\r\nthe most dangerous, nervous symptoms. To the latter belong the\r\ndifferent shades of paralysis met with during or subsequent to\r\ndiphtheria.\r\n\r\nSudden and unexpected collapse is sometimes observed, not infrequently\r\nin the earlier part of the disease. The changes found in autopsies,\r\nsuch as a dark color of the blood, deficient coagulability,\r\nextravasations into and friability and granular degenerations of the\r\ntissues, accumulations of degenerated cells, and granules between the\r\nfibres, degeneration mainly of the heart-muscle, the presence of\r\nheart-clots, thrombi in remote veins,--they all show to what extent\r\nthe disease can destroy life in the shortest time possible. In the\r\nheart either the pneumogastric or the ganglionic {676} nerves may be\r\naffected, and the symptoms will vary accordingly. Paralysis of the\r\nformer will accelerate the pulse, degeneration of the sympathetic will\r\ndiminish its frequency, yet death may ensue in either.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of diphtheritic paralysis makes its appearance during\r\nthe period of convalescence, at a time when all danger seems to have\r\npassed by. As a rule, the soft palate and the muscles of deglutition\r\nare the first to be attacked, while the condition of these organs is\r\napparently normal (and no longer oedematous, and thereby inactive, as\r\nin the first period of the disease). While they are recovering, or\r\nbefore, the accommodation muscles of the eyes become paralyzed.\r\nSometimes, however, these are the first to be affected. This paralysis\r\ndoes not, as a rule, follow severe cases; on the contrary, it is not\r\nuncommon to observe it after apparently mild attacks of the disease.\r\nIn consequence of the former paralysis, deglutition becomes difficult;\r\nfluids are expelled through the nose or enter the larynx and bronchi,\r\nthereby giving rise to pneumonia; in the latter there is strabismus.\r\nThe upper and lower extremities become paralyzed afterward. As a rule,\r\na number of muscles are affected at the same time, and improvement\r\nwill take place in about the same order in which the individual\r\nmuscles became affected. After paralysis has become affected,\r\ncirculation begins to suffer. The extremities now and then become\r\nbluish, cool, emaciated; rarely atrophy and fatty degeneration have\r\nbeen observed. The muscles of the neck also become paralyzed; the head\r\ncannot be carried, or with difficulty only. The fingers are but seldom\r\naffected. The same holds good of the bladder and intestines. The\r\nrespiratory muscles are not frequently attacked. Their paralysis is\r\nvery ominous, and may prove fatal in a short time from apnoea.\r\n\r\nNot only motory but sensory paralyses may occur. Anaesthesia,\r\namaurosis, deafness have been observed; a number of cases of locomotor\r\nataxia are on record, and but lately Hadthagen[12] publishes a case\r\nwhich he claims as disseminated sclerosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Arch. f. Kinderheilk._, vol. v., 1883.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the nervous affection in diphtheria is localized in a\r\npeculiar manner; it seems as if there is a predisposition on the part\r\nof a certain nerve to become diseased. The case of a boy, active and\r\nhealthy, in the practice of H. Guleke, is very interesting. In the\r\ncourse of three years he had three attacks of diphtheria. In the very\r\nbeginning of the disease he always became soporous with an almost\r\nnormal temperature and a slow but regular pulse. Probably the heart's\r\nganglia are the first to submit to the influence of the poison and\r\nexhibit symptoms of flagging function. In most of the cases of\r\ndiphtheritic paralysis the prognosis is good; the large majority will\r\nrun a favorable course in from six to ten weeks.\r\n\r\nINVASION.--Is diphtheria, primarily, a local or a constitutional\r\ndisease? Mercado's well-known case of diphtheria, engendered by the\r\nbiting of a finger, has been alluded to. I know of one case in which\r\nthe vagina became first affected, and later the pharynx. Bayles saw\r\ndenuded portions of skin assume a membranous character, and general\r\ndiphtheria develop afterward. Fresh wounds become diphtheritic, and\r\nthe general disease arises from this source. Even paralysis will\r\nfollow. I had a death from diphtheria when a long incision into a\r\nphlegmon of the thigh had become diphtheritic. A little girl, who had\r\na considerable amount {677} of discharge from a catarrhal vagina, and\r\nsore thighs in consequence, exhibited first, during the epidemic of\r\n1877, membranes on the denuded cutis, and afterward general\r\ndiphtheria. Brehm reports the case of a woman on whom he performed\r\ncolotomy. The wound became thoroughly diphtheritic and gangrenous, but\r\nthe pharynx and respiratory organs remained intact. A few days after,\r\nher daughter, who attended her in her sickness, was infected. In her\r\nthe pharynx was the seat of disorder. Besides, the tonsils are very\r\nfrequently coated with a membrane without any general symptoms in the\r\nbeginning, fever and general illness occurring only later on. Now, all\r\nof these facts tend to show that there are cases in which the origin\r\nof the disease is purely local.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, not be forgotten that during the prevalence of an\r\nepidemic every one is more or less under its influence, and but little\r\nis wanting to call forth the disease. Some years ago a well-known\r\nphysician, with whom I was intimately acquainted, died from facial\r\nerysipelas and meningitis which had originated in a slight abrasion of\r\nthe upper lip. During an epidemic of typhoid we daily see persons with\r\nfever, headache, and lassitude. Diarrhoeas are frequent during an\r\nepidemic of cholera. An epidemic of diphtheria is accompanied by a\r\ngreat number of cases of pharyngitis. When, in the year 1860,[13] I\r\nreported two hundred cases of bonâ fide diphtheria, I at the same time\r\nobserved one hundred and eighty-five cases of non-membranous\r\ninflammations of the throat. Such occurrences may be considered as\r\npossible or incipient cases of pharyngeal diphtheria. Therefore,\r\ncontrary to the view of a local origin of diphtheria, it may be\r\nclaimed that the individual taking the disease was already saturated\r\nwith the poison, and the local membrane represented perhaps nothing\r\nbut a symptom, or at the utmost the causa proxima. Accordingly, then,\r\nthere are undoubtedly cases in which the pharyngeal membrane is the\r\nfirst cause and symptom of the final affection, and others in which\r\nthe poisoning of the blood through inhalation is the first step in the\r\ndevelopment of the disease, amongst the symptoms of which the\r\npharyngeal or nasal membrane counts as one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Amer. Med. Times._, Aug.]\r\n\r\nIn these cases the first complaints of the patients relate to their\r\ngeneral condition. Sometimes they are ignorant of any local trouble\r\nwhen they consult a physician. When it is perceptible, however, it is\r\nusually found on the visible pharyngeal and respiratory mucous\r\nmembranes. This would seem to indicate that the infectious elements\r\nwhile being inhaled are there deposited. Thus there is a possibility\r\nof simultaneous affections of both the throat and the blood in the\r\nlungs, in either equal or variable proportions. We are easily led to\r\ndefend at least a partial admission of the poison by the respiratory\r\nact, when we reflect that the membranes which are swallowed are\r\nrendered innocuous by the action of the gastric fluids, and,\r\ntherefore, the alimentary canal, from the oesophagus downward, cannot\r\nbe made responsible for the admission of the poison into the system.\r\nThus it is that the general symptoms--as fever, lassitude,\r\netc.--precede the local phenomena in very many cases, while there are\r\nexceptional cases in which the membrane appears first and the fever\r\nlater. This is especially the case when the tonsils are very large and\r\noccupy a prominent position in the throat.\r\n\r\nThose cases which begin with high fever and moderate or no local {678}\r\nsymptoms must be looked upon as constitutional diseases. If a person,\r\nin the course of several hours or a day, be taken with high fever and\r\na moderate membrane-formation, these symptoms subsiding in one or two\r\ndays, leaving the patient weak and exhausted, but fully restored to\r\nhealth at the end of a week, we would be justified in assuming\r\n(cæteris paribus) that there was a rapid absorption of a large amount\r\nof poison, and an equally rapid elimination thereof. They are,\r\nmoreover, the same cases in which the second or third day of the\r\ndisease furnishes albuminuria, with rapid elimination and speedy\r\nrecovery. When, however, the process is slow in developing,\r\naccompanied by moderate fever, and the course is indolent, we have\r\nreason to infer that moderate amounts of the poison are being\r\ncontinually taken into the system and making their influence felt to a\r\nmoderate degree, but for a longer period. Such are the cases which,\r\nwithout any violent symptoms, are accompanied by frequent local\r\nrelapses, or run, when the absorption is constant as well as copious,\r\na septic course, or terminate in paralysis.\r\n\r\nThus there are cases in which a local infection of the skin or of a\r\nwound may be one of the causes, or the only cause, of the disease, and\r\nthere are cases in which the poison, in passing through and caught in\r\nthe pharynx, gives rise to local phenomena before the system at large\r\ngives evidence of infection. But, as a general thing, diphtheria must\r\nbe looked upon as a constitutional disease, giving rise to local\r\nphenomena, in the same way as scarlatina does on the skin, on the\r\nmucous membrane of the alimentary canal, and in the uriniferous\r\ntubules; measles on the skin and respiratory mucous membrane; or\r\ntyphoid in the lymph-follicles and on the mucous membrane of the\r\nintestine; or, in other words, the diphtheritic poison may enter the\r\nsystem locally through a defective, or sore, or wounded integument or\r\nthrough the lungs.\r\n\r\nIs diphtheria contagious? Undoubtedly it is. The contagious element is\r\nliable to be directly communicated by the patient; it also clings to\r\nsolid and semi-solid bodies, and in this way is transmitted even after\r\na long time. There is hardly any disease which can cling so\r\ntenaciously to dwellings and furniture; it can be transported by the\r\nair, though probably not to a great distance, and hence in houses\r\nartificially heated, while the windows and doors are mostly closed,\r\nrises from the lower to the upper stories; and it is for this reason\r\nadvisable to keep the sick on the top floor. It is certainly\r\ntransmitted by spoons, glasses, handkerchiefs, and towels used by the\r\npatient. The contagious character increases directly in proportion to\r\nthe neglect of proper ventilation. That it is spread by the feces is\r\nnot clearly established in my mind. I can give personally no examples\r\nof its being carried by visitors or by the attending physician; this\r\nis said to have occurred, however. The character of the disease\r\ncommunicated, and the local manifestation, do not depend on that of\r\nthe original sufferer; thus mild cases may produce severe ones, and\r\nvice versâ, and convalescents can convey the disease in its full\r\nforce. Naturally, the softer character of the tissues in children\r\nrenders them more susceptible to infection, and the activity of their\r\nlymphatic system more liable to severe forms of the disease.\r\n\r\nMany tragic cases are recorded in literature of infection by direct\r\ncontact from pharynx to pharynx, or from the opening in the trachea to\r\nthe mouth of the surgeon; and one of the saddest cases, perhaps, is\r\nthat of {679} the much-lamented Carl Otto Weber. Myself and others\r\nhave contracted diphtheria from sucking tracheotomy wounds.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the length of the incubation periods, there can be no\r\nbetter authenticated facts than those contained in a report of Elisha\r\nHarris to the National Board of Health, an abstract of which is found\r\nin No. 1, _National Board of Health Bulletin_, June 28, 1879. The\r\nreport says that in the fourth school district of the township of\r\nNewark (Northern Vermont), amidst the steep hills where reside a quiet\r\npeople in comfortable dwellings, the summer term of school opened on\r\nthe 12th of May. Among the twenty-two little children who assembled in\r\nthe school-room in the glen were two who had suffered from a mild\r\nattack of diphtheria in April, and one of them was, at the time school\r\nopened, suffering badly from what appeared to have been a relapse in\r\nthe form of diphtheritic ophthalmia. Besides, it is proved that these\r\nrecently sick pupils had not been well cleansed, one of them having on\r\nan unwashed garment that she had worn in all her sickness three weeks\r\npreviously. At the end of the third day of school several of the\r\nchildren were complaining of sore throat, headache, and dizziness, and\r\non the fourth day and evening so many were sick in the same way that\r\nthe teacher and officers announced the school temporarily closed. By\r\nthe end of the sixth day from school opening, sixteen of the\r\ntwenty-two previously healthy children became seriously sick with\r\nsymptoms of malignant diphtheria, and some were already dying. The\r\nteacher and six of the pupils were not attacked, nor have they since\r\nsuffered from the disease.\r\n\r\nA case[14] is reported of a surgeon who, while attending a\r\ndiphtheritic child, had some secretion thrown into his face. Twelve\r\nhours after his right eye was inflamed and painful. The affection\r\nproved diphtheritic, and recovery was completed after several weeks\r\nonly. In a case seen by me, with Dr. L. Bopp, a child removed from a\r\nhouse infected with diphtheria was attacked after fourteen days and\r\neight hours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Würt. Med. Corresp. Bl._, 1878, No. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt would then appear that, in the direct communication of the disease\r\nto healthy or nearly healthy mucous membranes--as healthy as the\r\nprevailing epidemic will allow--the period of incubation is from one\r\nor two to fourteen days. In only a small number of cases the disease\r\nhas an even shorter period of incubation than this, as when\r\ntonsillotomy or a similar operation is undertaken during the\r\nprevalence of an epidemic. One may rest assured that any operation on\r\nthe tonsils while an epidemic of diphtheria is at its height will be\r\nfollowed within twenty-four hours by diphtheritic deposits on the\r\nwounded part. To what extent we are justified in considering this a\r\nbonâ-fide incubation of the disease in a previously healthy body is,\r\nof course, another question. It seems to me that these cases\r\npositively prove that the operation is only the causâ proxima of a\r\ndiphtheritic affection, and that we may take it for granted that\r\nduring an epidemic every individual is more or less under its\r\ninfluence and affected by it, so that it needs but a wound or an\r\naccidental abrasion of the surface of the mucous membrane to call the\r\ndisease into action. In a similar way, fresh wounds or morbid\r\nconditions of the mouth may call forth the disease. The ruptured\r\nvesicles of a follicular stomatitis are liable to serve as\r\nresting-places for diphtheritic membranes, and thus I have seen the\r\ncomplication of a follicular stomatitis with oral diphtheria; and any\r\n{680} lacerations of the vagina during labor may become diphtheritic\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. If now, on the one hand, incubation depends\r\non the condition of the affected surface, it is probable, on the other\r\nhand, that the intensity of the poison at the time plays an important\r\npart in determining the period that is to elapse between infection and\r\nthe invasion of the disease.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Diphtheria is pre-eminently a disease of early life; in\r\nthis respect it is said to differ from the genuine fibrinous\r\nbronchitis, which by some is held an absolutely different disease, and\r\nstated to occur but rarely in children. But even this statement is\r\nprobably incorrect. In the spring of 1879 I met with four cases of\r\nfibrinous bronchitis in children under three years of age. The number\r\nof cases of diphtheria in adult life is not very large, while in old\r\nage it is very small. Of 501 deaths in Vienna in 1868, only 1 had\r\nreached the age of sixty-two; of more than 300 cases in which I\r\nperformed tracheotomy but 2 were over thirteen years old.\r\n\r\nI do not know that sex exerts any predisposing influence over\r\ndiphtheria, yet of the six hundred cases or thereabouts of laryngeal\r\ndiphtheria in which I either personally performed tracheotomy or\r\nobserved the progress of the disease in the practice of others, I\r\nfound the majority in males, and the recoveries in inverse proportion\r\nto the number thereof, the mortality being greater among boys. As far\r\nas age is concerned, nearly all the zymotic diseases are seen most\r\nfrequently in children. They exhibit a greater disposition to submit\r\nto diphtheria than adults, if we except those under ten months. Where,\r\nhowever, the disease has occurred previous to the seventh or eighth\r\nmonth, the greater number of cases has been found under three months.\r\nTigri reports the disease in a child of fourteen days. A child of\r\nfifteen days was seen with diphtheritic laryngitis and oesophagitis by\r\nBretonneau, one of seventeen days by Bednar, one of eight by Bouchut,\r\none of seven days by Weikert; Parrot mentions several cases, and\r\nSirédey[15] reports eighteen cases of diphtheria in the newly-born.\r\nThey occurred in the Hospital Lariboisière in the spring of 1877, and\r\nwere probably infected by the nurses of a neighboring children's\r\nasylum. Membranes were found on the soft palate, tonsils, or larynx,\r\nand also on both pharynx and larynx. One case occurred where the\r\nposterior nares alone were affected. I have met with four cases of\r\ndiphtheria of the pharynx and larynx in the newly-born myself. One of\r\nthese became sick on the ninth day after birth, and died on the\r\nthirteenth day; the other died on the sixteenth day after birth; the\r\nthird was taken when seven days old, and died on the ninth day. The\r\npredisposition to diphtheria during childhood[16] seems to be\r\nexplainable by several circumstances. The mucous membrane of the mouth\r\nand pharynx in the child is more succulent and softer, and frequently\r\nthe seat of a congestive and inflammatory process. The nasal cavities\r\nare small and frequently affected by catarrhs, the buccal cavity often\r\nthe seat of catarrh and of stomatitis, and insufficient cleanliness\r\nleads here to irritation of the mucous membrane. Any abnormal state of\r\nthe mucous membrane, with {681} the exception of an atrophic condition\r\nand cicatricial changes, affords an excellent abode for diphtheria.\r\nThe tonsils are proportionally large; in fact, we rarely see the\r\ntonsils in children completely sheltered by the arches of the palate.\r\nOn the other hand, the pharynx is anything but spacious, and while the\r\nprotuberant condition of the tonsils affords a resting-place for the\r\ninvading disease, the remaining space is so small that it becomes a\r\nsource of uneasiness to the well in many instances, and very much more\r\nthan that to the child during diphtheritic tumefaction. Furthermore,\r\nwe must take into consideration the large number and size of the\r\nlymphatics, which can be more easily injected in the child than in the\r\nadult, according to Sappey, and the fact of greater intercommunication\r\namongst the lymphatics and between them and the system; for S. L.\r\nSchenck has found that the network of lymphatics in the skin of the\r\nnewly-born, at least, are endowed with stomata, loopholes through\r\nwhich the lymph-ducts can communicate with the neighborhood, and vice\r\nversâ.[17] These circumstances, although they may have no influence in\r\ncalling the disease into existence, yet assist in its development and\r\nin adding to the severity of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Thèse, Paris, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: W. N. Thursfield (_London Lancet_, Aug. 3d, 10th, 17th,\r\n1878) collects 10,000 cases of diphtheria in England between the years\r\n1855 and 1877. Of these 90 per 1000 were under a year, 450 per 1000\r\nfrom 1-5 years, 260 from 6-10, 90 from 11-15, 50 from 16-25, 35 from\r\n26-45; 25 per 1000 were 45 years and over.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Mittheil. aus d. Embryol. Instit._, i., 1877.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while the above reasons go to prove that diphtheria\r\nattacks children by preference, there is again an anatomical and\r\nphysiological condition--to wit, the free slightly acid secretion of\r\nthe mouth, beginning with the third month--that acts as a hindrance to\r\nthe frequent occurrence of diphtheria after the third month. A poison\r\nor poisonous product of whatever nature can less readily find a\r\nhiding-place so long as it can be readily--we might always say must\r\nsurely be--washed away. During these months of eruptive secretion from\r\nthe mouth diphtheria, therefore, is not very frequent; thus teething,\r\nin the case of diphtheria, cannot be held responsible by mothers fond\r\nof diagnosticating dental diseases. In this connection the remark of\r\nKrieger ought not to be overlooked, who explains the relative scarcity\r\nof the disease in the first year of life by the fact that cumulative\r\ninfluences will produce a great number of cases, and cumulation\r\nrequires time. Undoubtedly, however, an important etiological\r\nconsideration is the fact of having had the disease previously. We can\r\ncite a host of zymotic diseases the occurrence of which once serves as\r\na protection against future attacks. Not only can no such security be\r\nexpected after one attack of diphtheria, but, cæteris paribus, the\r\ndisease shows a preference for those who have survived a previous\r\nattack. The statement that only the mild cases, with but slight\r\nelevation of temperature and freedom from severe constitutional\r\nsymptoms, are likely to suffer a relapse is founded on error. True, I\r\nhave more frequently seen relapses after mild cases--which,\r\nfortunately, are in the majority--but the disease has also recurred\r\nwhere originally high fever and an extensive lymphadenitis proved it\r\nto be a severe case. Besides, second attacks of membranous croup are\r\nalso recorded (Guersant, N. F. Gill, Quincke).\r\n\r\nAs there are individuals, so there are families, which have a\r\npredisposition to diseases, as there are others in whom,\r\nnotwithstanding ample exposure, infection does not easily take place.\r\nYet in the families in which diphtheria is of frequent occurrence it\r\ncannot always be attributed to enlarged tonsils and a tendency to\r\npharyngeal or nasal catarrh.\r\n\r\n{682} Still, catarrh and the vulnerability of mucous membranes must be\r\nconsidered as a frequent source of diphtheria; children will get\r\nnumerous relapses often after a nasal or pharyngeal catarrh. Sudden\r\nchanges in the temperature of the atmosphere or of the surface of the\r\nbody are therefore dangerous in predisposed persons. And thus it is\r\nthat while severe epidemics have spared no climate or land known to\r\nus, the majority of cases have occurred in winter and spring; in other\r\nwords, at a time when catarrhal disorders are of most frequent\r\noccurrence. In my experience at New York, the first quarter of the\r\nyear yielded more cases than any other. Still, they are frequent\r\nenough in warm seasons. Krieger insists upon the injurious influence\r\nof hot summers and dry hot rooms. I do not doubt the correctness of\r\nhis views, which cannot but be strengthened by the damaging results of\r\nour furnace-heating. But the influence of season on the invasion and\r\ncourse of diphtheria is but indirect and conditional, and may be,\r\nperhaps, after all, compared with that exerted by filth--a term which\r\nis lately used to express all sorts and forms of nastiness, from\r\nfilthy bodies of men to their clothes, their habits, their food, and\r\nthe air they breathe, whether polluted by carbonic acid, by\r\nexcrementitious gases, or by exhalations of sewers.\r\n\r\nCases of diphtheria which are traced to exhalations from sewers (or\r\neven to filthy habits of life) are very frequent. Yet typhoid is\r\nattributed to the same causes. So is dysentery. Can, then, foul\r\nexhalations produce alike diphtheria, typhoid, and dysentery? Do these\r\ndiseases arise from a common poison? Or is the poison of a treble\r\ncharacter, so that a part may give origin to diphtheria, another part\r\nto typhoid, a third to dysentery?[18] Have we to deal, in such\r\noccurrences, with specific influences, or only with a lowering of the\r\nstandard of health, thereby affording other morbid influences an\r\nopportunity to exercise their power? These questions are still\r\ninvolved in darkness, and constitute problems the solution of which\r\nstill engages the minds of both individual writers and authorities. A\r\nreport of the Board of Health of Massachusetts, closely adhering to\r\nthe results of exact observations,[19] leaves them doubtful, and the\r\naffirmative reports of some modern writers do not bear scrutiny.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: In regard to the causal connection of the two latter\r\ndiseases with sewer exhalations we can be more positive than in regard\r\nto the former.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Author's _Treatise on Diphth._, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: M. A. Avery, _Med. Jour. and Obst. Rev._, Feb., 1882.]\r\n\r\nAir polluted by bad drainage or leaky sewers has been considered\r\nresponsible for diphtheria as well as for typhoid fever and dysentery.\r\nNot only the impairment of general health, but the direct and\r\nunmistakable disease, has been attributed to it. Thus Bayley refers,\r\nin the endemic of Bromley,[21] the first cases to unventilated sewers\r\nand cesspools. School-children multiplied the disease. Thursfield\r\nattributes the diphtheria at Ellesmere[22] to the accumulation of\r\nexcrements under the school-room, and to deficient supply of water,\r\nwhich, moreover, was of bad quality. Tripe (like Railton, Bailey,\r\nRussell, Bell) accuses sewer gas;[23] others polluted waters or bad\r\ndrainage.[24] I have not been convinced, however, that diphtheria can\r\nbe considered a sewer-gas disease, in the same way as typhoid fever.\r\nThe deterioration of the general health resulting from the inhalation\r\nof foul air is sufficient to explain the outbreak of the individual\r\nattack during a prevailing epidemic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Sanit. Record_, Aug. 10, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _San. Rec._, 158, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Ibid._, June 14, 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Ibid._, April 18, May 2, 1879.]\r\n\r\n{683} In regard to polluted water, I do not think that pathologists\r\nwho attribute infectious diseases to bacteria only are justified in\r\ncondemning it. It may not be so guilty, after all, for the admixtures,\r\ninorganic and organic, minerals, admixtures of wood and plants, also\r\nlower fungi and their products--algæ, infusoria--would render water\r\nrather disagreeable, but not exactly unhealthy. The latter effect can\r\nbe accomplished--always assuming the bacteria theory correct, for the\r\nsake of argument--by bacteria only. But when they arrive in the\r\nstomach, their doom is sealed; they are decomposed. The only places\r\nwhere, possibly, they could take root would be diseased or ulcerated\r\nplaces in either the oral cavity or the upper portion of the\r\noesophagus.\r\n\r\nNot only water, but the milk of animals also, has been accused of\r\nbeing the direct cause of diphtheria. Powers concludes, though a\r\nconnection between diphtheria and the consumption of milk have not\r\nbeen proven as yet, that it is very probable indeed. His careful\r\ninvestigations into the causes of some local epidemics in North London\r\nexclude any other source from which the people could have been\r\naffected. Perhaps one of the forms of garget, cow mammitis, is of an\r\ninfectious character. His reasoning, however, is not accepted by A.\r\nDowrus,[25] who still believes that the milk which gave rise to\r\ndiphtheria at a distance may have been soiled and infected. For though\r\nthe connection between milk and scarlatina and typhoid fever had been\r\nknown for years and variously studied, no observation of the kind had\r\nyet been made in regard to diphtheria. Besides, where the young, in\r\nEngland, drink much milk--viz. in the cities--diphtheria was very much\r\nless frequent than where little or no milk was taken--viz. in the\r\ncountry. Even in the country the well-to-do classes, who drink milk,\r\nhad but little diphtheria, while the children of the poor, who\r\nobtained none, suffered a great deal from it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: \"Diphtheria and Milk-Supply,\" _Brit. Med. Journ._, Feb.\r\n1, 1879.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to this transmission of diphtheria by means of milk O.\r\nBollinger[26] hesitates to express any opinion, except that the matter\r\nis very doubtful indeed. Probably the possibility of contracting\r\ndiphtheria directly from animals is very much greater than the danger\r\nfrom water or milk. On a Pomeranian farm, during the winter 1875-76,\r\nevery newly-born calf died of diphtheria. The superintendent of the\r\nfarm and the woman who attended to the calves were taken with\r\ndiphtheritic angina.[27] Similar occurrences have been recorded.\r\nBollinger reports a mycotic disease of the trachea and lungs in birds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _D. Z. f. Thiermed. u. vergleich. Pathol._, vi., 1879,\r\np. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Damman, in _D. Zeitsch. f. Thiermed._, 1876, p. 1.]\r\n\r\nFriedberger's report,[28] presented to the Veterinary Society of\r\nMunich, on croup and diphtheria of domestic fowls, leaves no doubt as\r\nto its frequency, particularly amongst the nobler varieties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _D. Zeitsch. f. Thiermed._, v., 1879, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nNicati[29] studied an epidemic diphtheria amongst hens which had\r\nsimilar symptoms and a course very much like that in man; it could be\r\ninoculated into other animals, and was contemporaneous with the\r\noutbreak of the epidemic amongst the human population of Marseilles.\r\nTrasbot[30] succeeded in inoculating a healthy hen from a diphtheritic\r\none, but the {684} attempts at transmission to dog, pig, and man were\r\nunsuccessful. The _Med. and Surg. Journal_[31] contains the following:\r\nIn a house at Ogdensburg, N.Y., five children were ill with\r\ndiphtheria. Three kittens who had been playing with them from time to\r\ntime took the disease and died. Post-mortem examination showed\r\ndiphtheritic membranes in their throats.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Revue d'Hygiène et de Police sanitaire_, 1879, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: \"De la transmission de la Diphth. des Animaux à\r\nl'Homme,\" _Gaz. hebdom._, 1879 Avril 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Med. Rec._, Nov. 8, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: An elaborate description of the croupo-diphtheritic\r\ninflammations of mucous membranes in hens, turkeys, pheasants, and\r\npigeons may be found in _Zürn. Krankh. d. Hausgeflügels_, 1882, p.\r\n104.]\r\n\r\nGerhardt[33] reports the following: 2600 hens were imported from\r\nVerona, Italy, into a village, Messelhausen, in Baden. Some of these\r\nhens were affected with diphtheria when they arrived. Within six weeks\r\n600 of their number died of diphtheria, and 800 more soon after. In\r\nthe following summer 1000 chickens were raised by artificial breeding,\r\nall of which died of diphtheria within six weeks. Five cats kept in\r\nthe place also died of diphtheria; a parrot fell sick with it, but\r\nrecovered. An Italian cook, suffering from diphtheria, in the month of\r\nNovember, 1881, while being subjected to local treatment with carbolic\r\nacid, bit the head-nurse's left foot and hand. Both these wounds\r\nbecame diphtheritic, the man falling sick with high fever, and\r\nrequiring three weeks for his gradual recovery. Besides, four of the\r\nsix workingmen employed in taking care of the hens of the\r\nestablishment were taken with diphtheria. Not a single case, however,\r\noccurred in the neighboring village. Thus, it is safe to assume that\r\nthe diphtheritic disease of hens can be transmitted to man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Verhandlungen des_ (ii.) _Congresses für Innere\r\nMedicin_, Wiesbaden, 1883, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nDiphtheria may be also produced by outside influences. In this regard\r\nthe attempts at generating pseudo-membranes by artificial means are\r\nvery interesting indeed. As early as 1826, Bretonneau, by the\r\nintroduction of tincture of cantharides and olive oil into the\r\ntrachea, succeeded in producing a \"dense, elastic, reed-like\r\nmembranous concretion.\" Delafond called croup into existence by the\r\nuse of ammonia, oxygen, chlorine, corrosive sublimate, arsenic, and\r\nsulphuric acid. On the other hand, H. Mayer asserts that it is\r\nimpossible, by means of ammonia, to produce a croup in the windpipes\r\nof animals which in the slightest degree resembles that occurring in\r\nhuman beings. Trendelenburg, however, after producing membranes in the\r\ntrachea by the use of a solution of corrosive sublimate (1:120),\r\nsucceeded in hardening the entire mass with bichromate of potassium,\r\nwhich it was impossible to do with the most tenacious mucus.\r\n\r\nRey observed croup in horses that inhaled smoke in a burning\r\nstable.[34] In the collection of the veterinary school of Zurich there\r\nis a croup membrane from a heifer which had been exposed to a fire; at\r\nMunich, one from the trachea of a horse, produced by forcibly\r\ninjecting medicines into the nose. Hahn made an observation on cows,\r\nW. Ammon on horses, of long croup membranes after the animals had been\r\nexposed to smoke and fire; and Oertel constantly insists on there\r\nbeing \"no actual difference between croup as it ordinarily occurs and\r\nthat excited in the windpipe of a rabbit by means of ammonia. The\r\ncolor and texture, the physical, chemical, and histological\r\ncharacteristics, are identical.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Journ. de méd. vét. de Lyon_, 1850, p. 249.]\r\n\r\n{685} MORBID ANATOMY.--Either the membrane or the granular\r\ninfiltration is characteristic of diphtheria. The statement that the\r\nformer occurs only when atmospheric air can gain access thereto, as A.\r\nd'Espine and C. Picot still hold,[35] is plainly contradicted by its\r\nappearance on the mucous membrane of the lower intestines. The\r\ncondition of the membrane is not unalterable, any more than the\r\nclinical symptoms of the disease, for, according to different\r\ncircumstances, epithelium, mucus, blood, and vegetable parasites are\r\nadded thereto. The membrane can either be lifted from the mucous\r\nmembrane on which it lies or is imbedded into and underneath it. In\r\nthe first instance, it consists to a great extent of fibrin, the\r\nresult either of epithelial changes or derived directly from the\r\nexuded blood-serum. E. Wagner, who makes no anatomical distinction\r\nbetween croup and diphtheria, considers epithelial changes the\r\nprincipal source. The pavement epithelium becomes altered in a\r\npeculiar manner. It becomes turbid, larger, dentated, and dissolves\r\ninto a network; it is at first uninhabited, but serves later as the\r\nvehicle of newly-formed cells; there also occurs a considerable\r\ninfiltration of the mucous membrane pus-cells and granules; besides,\r\nthe cellular tissue is studded with granules, the granular\r\ndegeneration resulting sometimes in necrotic destruction, which is\r\nlooked upon by Virchow as the most important element in severe forms\r\nof diphtheria. The several conditions or degrees may occur independent\r\nof each other, associated or in succession. Classen shares Wagner's\r\nviews, but, according to Boldygrew, the pseudo-membrane consists of\r\nsuccessive coagulations of a fibrinous fluid which exudes from the\r\ndiseased surface. Steudener also opposes the views of Wagner. He does\r\nnot believe in the probability of an exclusively endogenous origin of\r\nthe cellular elements of croup membrane; in fact, he doubts the\r\noccurrence of an endogenous formation of pus-globules in epithelium.\r\nCroupous membrane, according to him, is formed by the migration of\r\nnumerous white blood-globules through the walls of the vessels in the\r\nmucous membrane, and by a direct formation of fibrin from the\r\ntransuded plasma. In addition to this, the mucous membrane is stripped\r\nof its epithelium (except at the mouths of the acinous glands) and\r\ninfiltrated with migrating cells. Fresh croupous membrane consists of\r\na delicate network of homogeneous structure and shining appearance, in\r\nwhich numerous cells and the epithelium of the various layers of the\r\ntrachea are imbedded. In old membranes the cells are destroyed by\r\ngranular degeneration and general maceration. Tenacious mucus with\r\npus-cells and detritus are then found. C. Weigert looks upon the\r\ndeposits as analogous to those on serous membranes. Every inflammation\r\nyields an exudation which may coagulate when the coagulating ferment\r\nis added. This latter is probably produced by the white blood-cells\r\nwhen in disintegration. But he does not say why it is that there is no\r\nsuch coagulation in suppurative processes, where the leucocytes are\r\nmore numerous. He believes himself justified in establishing\r\npathological differences of croup, pseudo-diphtheria, and diphtheria.\r\nA croupous inflammation means destruction of epithelium, which gives\r\nrise to a fibrinous exudation upon the surface, while the cellular\r\ntissue remains intact. The only difference between it and the\r\npseudo-diphtheritic inflammation is looked for in the larger number of\r\nemigrated white {686} blood-cells. The superficial deposit consists,\r\nto a great part, of them and the fibrinous exudation. When there are\r\nbut few leucocytes the deposit is a network of fibrillæ (croup). When\r\nthere are many, the masses are more solid and voluminous\r\n(pseudo-diphtheritis). When, however, the tissue is changed into a\r\nhard substance resembling coagulated fibrin, when the exudation does\r\nnot exist on the surface, but takes place into the mucous membrane,\r\nthe process is diphtheria. Zahn also establishes three varieties--viz.\r\n1st, such as result from a peculiar degeneration of pavement\r\nepithelium; 2d, such as originate in the solidification of a\r\nmuco-fibrinous, and, 3d, of a fibrino-purulent, exudation. Each of\r\nthese varieties may contain colonies of micrococci, but these\r\norganisms are neither essential nor are they constantly found.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Man. prat. des mal. de l'enfance_, 1877, p. 81.]\r\n\r\nThe diphtheritic process does not merely consist of the membranous\r\nchanges in the pharynx and air-passages. Its fatal cases have afforded\r\nmarked evidence of the implication of most of the organs. Reimer's 17\r\ncases give the following post-mortem results: the lungs were hyperæmic\r\nin 8 cases, twice the seat of pneumonia, and three times of embolic\r\ninfarctions; in addition, emphysema in 12, oedema in 6, atelectasis in\r\n7, subpleural ecchymoses in 7, pericardial ones in 4. The heart-muscle\r\nhad undergone fatty degeneration in 6, and was the seat of ecchymoses\r\nof the size of a pin's head in 3. In addition to frequent hyperæmic\r\nconditions of the abdominal viscera, emboli of the liver in 3 (with\r\ncapillary hemorrhages of the peritoneal covering in 1), emboli of the\r\nspleen in 5, desquamative nephritis in 7 (in 6 of which there were\r\ncolonies of micrococci in the uriniferous tubules), cellular\r\nhyperplasia of the cervical and mediastinal glands in 14 (complicated\r\nin 6 with capillary hemorrhages in the glandular tissue). The blood\r\nwas frequently normal, very often watery and dark, at times\r\nleucocythæmic. Thus the disease exerts its influence everywhere.\r\n\r\nRindfleisch defines diphtheritic inflammation as that form of\r\ninflammation which produces a coagulating necrosis in the tissues by\r\nthe immigration of schizomycetæ. The coagulating necrosis differs from\r\nthe usual form of necrosis in this, that the change from life to death\r\nis accompanied with the coagulation of fluid albuminoids. This process\r\ntakes place mainly in the interior of cells and other parts of\r\ntissues, and therein differs from the coagulation of fibrin. In the\r\ncells there is taking place a peculiar homogenization of protoplasm;\r\nat the same time the nuclei disappear, and are changed into irregular\r\nmasses liable to cohere and form membranous conglomerates, which owe\r\ntheir peculiar wax color to the invasion of a solid albuminoid endowed\r\nwith a strong tendency to refract the light. Coagulating necrosis is\r\nfound in circumscribed localities, and gives rise, in the\r\nneighborhood, to a marked amount of inflammation and suppuration,\r\nwhich leads to the expulsion of the necrotic part, with more or less\r\nloss of substance--either mild or phagedenic ulceration.\r\n\r\nLeyden describes a gray degeneration of the muscular tissue which he\r\nbelieves to be truly inflammatory, and Unruh has lately published an\r\naccount of some cases in which myocarditis occurred. In Leyden's\r\ncases, the muscular nuclei were increased, became atrophied, and\r\nunderwent fatty degeneration, giving rise thereby to extravasations,\r\nsoftening, dilatation and debility of the heart, with general\r\ndebility, collapse, {687} and--probably by reflex action on other\r\nbranches of the pneumogastric--vomiting. Micrococci he found neither\r\nin the heart nor in the kidneys.\r\n\r\nIn the heart, particularly on the right side, numerous thrombi are\r\nfrequently found in various stages of development; its muscular tissue\r\nis often in a state of fatty degeneration or the seat of\r\nparenchymatous inflammation and hemorrhages. Bridges first called\r\nattention to the occurrence of endocarditis in diphtheria.[36] This\r\ncomplication, which, however, occurs more frequently with rheumatism,\r\npuerperal fever, diphtheria of wounds, pyæmia, and old valvular\r\naffections than in the course of an acute diphtheria, does not, as\r\nfound in the latter affection, consist simply of a fatty degeneration\r\nand subsequent ulceration, but is considered a genuine diphtheritic\r\nprocess (Virchow), affecting the mitral valve more frequently than the\r\ntricuspid or pulmonary valves. It begins with hyperæmia and the\r\nexudation of plasma in the cellular elements, so that they appear\r\nlarger and darker. The granulations which form are frail and easily\r\ndestroyed, so that ulcers form on which fibrin is deposited, and\r\nwhence it is conveyed as emboli into the terminal arteries (Cohnheim)\r\nof the spleen, nerves, brain, and eye. Infarctions may also occur in\r\nthe valveless veins of these organs, giving rise rather to small\r\nmultiple abscesses than to large purulent collections. Suppuration but\r\nrarely takes place in the heart; the granular mass found there resists\r\nthe action of æther and alcohol, and spreads throughout the cardiac\r\nparenchyma, so that perforation of the septum and of the right auricle\r\nand aorta has been observed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Med. Times and Gaz._, ii. p. 204.]\r\n\r\nBouchut and Labadie-Lagrave, out of 15 cases of diphtheria, met in 14\r\nwith a plastic endocarditis, which became the source of emboli. Thus,\r\nthere were infarctions of the lungs, at times in their centre\r\ncolorless, at other times in a state of purulent degeneration;\r\nsuperficial thrombi of the small veins of the heart, subcutaneous\r\nconnective tissue, pia mater, brain, and liver; and in addition,\r\nmoderate leucocytosis.\r\n\r\nThe lungs exhibit (post-mortem) all sorts of inflammatory and\r\ncongestive conditions, with their consequences, as oedema, catarrh,\r\nbroncho-pneumonia, atelectasis, emphysema, ecchymoses, and large\r\ninfarctions.\r\n\r\nThe spleen (and occasionally the liver) is frequently large,\r\ncongested, and friable, and studded with infarctions to a greater or\r\nless extent.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are either simply congested or the seat of nephritis or\r\ninfarctions. The same forms of inflammation which accompany\r\nscarlatina--to wit, the desquamative and the diffuse--are here\r\nobserved. The diffuse form is not of so frequent occurrence as in\r\nscarlatina, but is sometimes extensive and dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe muscles occasionally exhibit ecchymoses, and are at times the seat\r\nof parenchymatous inflammation, gray degeneration, and atrophy.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic glands are frequently inflamed and swollen, either hard\r\nor doughy, oedematous or congested. Large abscesses are rare. It is\r\nmore especially the gland tissue, and less the connective tissue of\r\nthe glands, which takes part in the pathological process. The\r\nperiglandular tissue very soon becomes involved, however. Necrotic\r\nfoci have been described by Bizzozero. When the entire surface of the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth and of the air-passages, from the nose to\r\nthe trachea, is the seat of the disease, there is an impregnation of\r\nthe mucous membrane, from the epithelial surface to the submucous\r\ntissue, of the entire {688} tongue, borders of the lips, and\r\nfrequently of the lips and cheeks, as well as of the tonsils, the\r\nlower portion of the nasal cavities and the upper, and especially the\r\nanterior, portion of the larynx. The fossæ Morgagni and the posterior\r\naspect of the soft palate are more frequently affected in the same way\r\nthan the anterior aspect. Small isolated spots are found on the\r\ntonsils and occasionally on the posterior wall of the pharynx. The\r\nso-called croupous form--that is to say, the one in which the\r\nmembranes deposited may either be removed in large patches or lie\r\nmacerated in the profuse secretion of subjacent mucous glands--is\r\nfound partly in the nasal cavities, on the posterior surface of the\r\nsoft palate, and also in the trachea and its subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThe character of the mucous membrane varies with the locality. Its\r\ndifferent elements, as the epithelium, the basement membrane, the\r\nconnective tissue mingled with elastic fibres, the blood-vessels, the\r\nnerves from the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, and the\r\npapillæ and ducts of numberless glands, all influence the pathological\r\nprocess going on upon the surface. Their distribution in the oral\r\ncavity and the respiratory organs is a very interesting study, and in\r\na table already published,[37] I have exhibited it in a condensed\r\ntabular form.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Treatise on Diphtheria_, p. 126.]\r\n\r\nWhere elastic tissue predominates, diphtheritic impregnation is slow\r\nto take place, and recovery is also slow when the tissue has finally\r\nsubmitted. Pavement epithelium yields the easiest foothold to\r\ndiphtheritic membrane. Thus it is that the tonsils, not from their\r\nprominent situation alone, favor the reception and development of the\r\ninfection. But the elastic and connective fibres when once affected\r\nare apt to harbor the disease a long time. Still, there is another\r\nreason why the diphtheritic process should favor the tonsils. For Th.\r\nHöhr has demonstrated that their epithelium exhibits interruptions in\r\nits continuity. Through them round cells may emigrate. Wherever the\r\nepithelial covering of the integuments (skin or mucous membrane) is\r\nintact and unbroken, diphtheria takes hold with difficulty. But where\r\na defect is established, large or small, diphtheritic formations will\r\nbe apt to take place according to the size of the abrasion. This is\r\none of the modes of the formation of small diphtheritic deposits on\r\nthe tonsils, which it has been the tendency of many, both\r\npractitioners and authors, to honor with special names.\r\n\r\nCiliated epithelium is not so liable to be affected. It occupies a\r\nhigher rank in the scale of animal formations, has a more complex\r\nfunction and a greater power of resistance. The presence of a large\r\nnumber of mucous glands impedes, as a rule, by the presence of the\r\nnormal secretion, an extensive destructive action upon the tissues.\r\nThe secreted mucus assists in removing epithelial masses, and even\r\nfibrinous exudations, from the surface. Thus it is that the deposits\r\nin the respiratory portion of the nasal cavities are frequently cast\r\noff through the nostrils, and in a similar manner the membranes that\r\nhave formed in the trachea are ejected in a semi-solid condition\r\nthrough the opening made by tracheotomy. The large number of mucous\r\nglands in the larynx and trachea is unquestionably the reason why the\r\nlymphatic vessels of the mucous membrane are not influenced by the\r\noverlying loosened masses, and will not absorb; hence laryngeal and\r\ntracheal diphtheria, when not complicated, have decidedly a local\r\ncharacter, and are usually devoid of constitutional symptoms. For the\r\n{689} same reason the usual form of tonsillar diphtheria is a mild\r\ndisease. On the other hand, the large number and size of the lymphatic\r\nducts of the Schneiderian mucous membrane, as well as their direct\r\ncommunication with the lymphatic glands of the neck, accounts for the\r\ndangerous character of nasal diphtheria.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria of the intestinal canal is characterized by fibrinous\r\ndeposits on the surface and in the tissues of the intestine, with\r\nsubsequent granular degeneration. It is mostly preceded by a catarrhal\r\nprocess. The same condition is found in the urinary organs.\r\n\r\nThere are but few autopsies of cases which have died of, or during,\r\ndiphtheritic paralysis. In some instances there was considerable\r\nthickening of the spinal nerves at the junction of the posterior and\r\nanterior roots, with hemorrhages. The superficial connective tissue in\r\nthese places exhibited a diphtheritic exudation (Buhl). There was in\r\nthe sheath of the nerves of the cerebral and spinal meninges and in\r\nthe gray substance of the cord voluminous nuclear infiltration; in one\r\ncase there were extensive hemorrhages in the spinal meninges, with\r\nnuclear proliferation in the gray substance of the cord (Oertel).\r\nDisseminated meningitis with perineuritis of the neighboring roots,\r\ncharacterized by infiltration of nuclei between the nerve-fibrillæ was\r\nfound by Pierret; and degeneration of the palatine nerves and fatty\r\ndegeneration of the palatine muscles by Charcot and Vulpian. Dejerine,\r\nin five autopsies, records an atrophy of the anterior roots secondary\r\nto a myelitic degeneration of the ganglia of the anterior horns. E.\r\nGaucher found the same in the case of a boy who died with paralysis of\r\nthe muscles of deglutition, of the extremities, and of the trunk. In a\r\nchild of two years with paralysis of the palate and extremities the\r\nautopsy was negative. In two cases Dejerine reports finding changes in\r\nthe intramuscular nerves, such as liquefaction of myelin and loss of\r\naxis cylinders.\r\n\r\nThus, Buhl, Charcot, Vulpian, and Dejerine are unanimous about an\r\naffection of the peripheric nerves and muscles. Oertel, Dejerine, and\r\nGaucher believe in a disease of the spinal cord. It is true that a\r\ndisease of the gray substance would fully explain the symptoms of the\r\nbad cases, but what we know of poliomyelitis anterior, with which this\r\naffection would be identical, precludes the idea of the rapid and\r\nalmost certain complete recovery. Therefore, in most cases,\r\ndiphtheritic paralysis consists of a trophic affection of the motor\r\nsystem, almost always seated peripherally in the nerves and muscles,\r\nseldom, if ever, in the centres. This affection must be compared, in\r\nmost of its relations, with the degenerative processes taking place in\r\nthe muscular tissue after typhoid fever, or in the renal epithelium\r\nafter infectious diseases, both of which give rise to serious results,\r\nwith usually a favorable termination.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The characteristic sign of diphtheria is either the\r\nmembrane or the gray infiltration, with more or less injection of the\r\nsurrounding parts. In regard to this greater or less injection, I will\r\nsay that pharyngeal congestion, when it is uniform, may or may not\r\npoint to imminent diphtheria. When it is local, confined to one side\r\nmainly, it is either traumatic or diphtheritic. White spots which are\r\neasily washed away, or which can be removed with a brush, or squeezed\r\nout of the follicles of the tonsils, into which a probe can be\r\nintroduced sometimes to the depth of one-half inch, soon announce\r\ntheir true character--viz. either a {690} simple catarrhal secretion\r\nor suppuration. Even though the superficial deposit contain oidium or\r\nleptothrix in considerable numbers, it can easily be removed; I have\r\nonly known the totally inexperienced to mistake muguet (thrush) for\r\ndiphtheria. In the larynx muguet is, moreover, very rare indeed, and\r\nalways circumscribed. It is sometimes seen on the true vocal cords.\r\nThe gray discoloration of superficial follicular ulcerations, as\r\nobserved in the ordinary form of stomatitis follicularis, can hardly\r\nfail to be recognized. Such patches are very numerous in the fauces\r\nand on the lips and cheeks--never on the gums, except in ulcerous\r\nstomatitis (which is not follicular). They are accompanied, too, by\r\nvesicles containing more or less serum which have not yet ruptured. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that the mucous membrane, when deprived\r\nof its superficial covering, is liable during an epidemic of\r\ndiphtheria to become infected, like every other wound. I have seen\r\ncases in which stomatitis and diphtheria existed side by side, the\r\nlatter having invaded the surfaces exposed by the former. The\r\nexamination of the entire throat is not always easy. Very young\r\nchildren vomit frequently and persistently before the whole surface is\r\nexposed to view, and not infrequently repeated examination with the\r\nspatula is absolutely necessary. In general, however, the slight\r\nattempts at vomiting suffice to cause a great part of the swollen\r\nposterior portion of the tonsils to become visible. I have heard that\r\nthe pale surface of old hyperplastic tonsils has been mistaken for\r\ndiphtheria; I merely mention the fact. When a discoloration happens to\r\nbe the result of a deposited flake of mucus, a drink of water will\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nFever is not always a prominent symptom; as a rule, simple diphtheria\r\nof the tonsils is accompanied by very little fever. Still, there are\r\nplenty of exceptions. But the differences of temperature are not more\r\nstriking than in most other infectious diseases, whose either mild or\r\nsevere invasion may offer an obstacle to immediate diagnosis. As the\r\nheight of the fever does not absolutely determine, or even indicate,\r\nthe character of the subsequent course of the disease, but little\r\nimportance is to be attached to the temperature unless there be a very\r\nmarked elevation. A sudden rise frequently occurs with lymphadenitis.\r\nHigh fever in the beginning may render the diagnosis difficult or may\r\npostpone it.\r\n\r\nThe absence of glandular swelling does not exclude the diagnosis of\r\ndiphtheria, for when the tonsils are affected by the disease there is\r\nusually little or no swelling of the neighboring glands. Swelling of\r\nthe glands enables us to locate the affection in a mucous membrane\r\nrichly endowed with lymphatic vessels. It is very marked when the nose\r\nis affected. A few hours' duration of nasal diphtheria suffices for\r\nthe development of a severe lymphadenitis, especially at the angles of\r\nthe jaw. When the latter condition is found to exist, the throat\r\nshould be examined with the idea of finding a membrane extending\r\nupward; nasal diphtheria is very liable to complicate an affection of\r\nthe uvula and arches of the palate. The membrane cannot well be seen\r\nby looking through the nostrils; highly serviceable for this purpose\r\nis a very short, broad rhinoscope reaching upward to the bony\r\nstructure of the nose. However, nasal diphtheria may frequently be\r\ndiagnosticated some days before the membrane becomes visible, by the\r\nrapid development of lymphadenitis; this may be done even where the\r\nsweetish, musty odor of certain forms {691} of diphtheria is absent.\r\nStill, nasal diphtheria may occur without much lymphadenitis; as, for\r\ninstance, when the blood-vessels are very numerous and superficial,\r\nand thereby give rise to slight hemorrhages at the very beginning of\r\nthe sickness. In such cases the lymphatic vessels are little, if at\r\nall, required to transmit the poison, the open blood-vessels replacing\r\nthem in the function of absorbing. Naturally, there are cases in which\r\nan ocular examination cannot be satisfactorily made. In the journals\r\nwe read of brilliant results of rhinoscopic and laryngoscopic\r\nexamination; in practice we see but few. This holds good especially\r\nfor the cases of dyspnoea accompanying laryngeal diphtheria, where the\r\ndiagnosis may be doubtful when no membrane can be detected in the\r\nfauces; even if membrane be observed there, symptoms of suffocation\r\nmay still arise from a laryngeal stenosis independent of membranous\r\ndeposits in the larynx. If aphonia and difficulty of both inspiration\r\nand expiration be present at the same time, there is certainly\r\nmembranous occlusion. If aphonia appear late, or even toward the very\r\nlast, and only inspiration be impeded while expiration is\r\ncomparatively free, there is an oedematous saturation of the\r\nary-epiglottidean folds and of their copious submucous tissue, and\r\nconsequently of the posterior attachment of the vocal cords. Although\r\na general oedema glottidis in connection with diphtheria is of\r\nexceedingly rare occurrence, the above condition is not at all\r\nuncommon, and has forced me to tracheotomize many times; but, again, a\r\ncomprehension of the true condition, where it occurred in not very\r\nsevere cases, has on several occasions enabled me to avoid an\r\noperation. This local oedema may sometimes be detected by palpation in\r\nthe region of the swollen posterior wall of the pharynx.\r\n\r\nOne of the diagnostic symptoms of membranous laryngitis, believed in\r\nand referred to by Krönlein, does not exist--viz. the swelling of the\r\nlymphatic glands, which in his opinion is pathognomonic. Not only is\r\nthat not the case, but the absence or scarcity of lymphatics on the\r\nvocal cords and in their neighborhood renders the absence of glandular\r\nswellings a necessity, provided the latter do not depend on\r\ncomplicating diphtheria in other localities. In uncomplicated\r\ndiphtheritic laryngitis I expect no lymphadenitis. The character of\r\nthe laryngeal pseudo-membrane does not depend at all on the condition\r\nof the pharynx. The latter may have membranes of any description or\r\nconsistency without permitting the diagnosis of the condition of the\r\nlarynx. I lay stress on this fact because no less a writer than\r\nKrönlein believes that where there is but little or no membrane in the\r\npharynx, that in the larynx is rather loose and movable.\r\n\r\nOne of the diagnostic symptoms of diphtheritic laryngitis, or\r\nmembranous croup, is the relative absence of fever. Catarrhal\r\nlaryngitis, or pseudo-croup, is a feverish disease. A sudden attack of\r\ncroup with high temperature, provided there is no pharyngeal or other\r\ndiphtheria present, yields a good prognosis; without much fever, a\r\nvery doubtful one.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of diphtheritic paralysis offers very little difficulty\r\nin most cases. Its occurrence after an attack of diphtheria, its\r\nbeginning in the fauces or in the muscles controlled by the ciliary\r\nnerves, the immunity of the sphincters, the gradual development, the\r\nirregularity of its progress, are good diagnostic points. Examination\r\nby the interrupted or continuous current is not conclusive. Very\r\nfrequently in the {692} beginning the response to the interrupted\r\ncurrent is normal, sometimes deficient; to the continuous current,\r\nexaggerated. After some time the power of both to excite contraction\r\nis diminished. When we reflect on the numerous causes which may\r\nunderlie diphtheritic paralysis, and that we have not to deal with one\r\nand the same anatomical change in all cases, it becomes apparent that\r\nno reliable conclusions can be based upon electrical examination.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--In general, the prognosis in diphtheria is favorable when\r\nthe affected surface is of small extent and where such parts are the\r\nseat of disease as have little communication with the lymphatic\r\nsystem. To the latter class belongs simple diphtheria of the tonsils.\r\nMarked glandular swelling, particularly if arising suddenly, is always\r\nan unfavorable sign, and calls for the utmost caution in prognosis,\r\nespecially if the region of the angles of the jaw be speedily and\r\nmarkedly infiltrated. This, as we have seen, is particularly apt to\r\noccur with nasal diphtheria, whether developed primarily, (and then\r\naccompanied by a thin fetid discharge), or, as is more commonly the\r\ncase, secondarily from an affection of the pharynx and palate which\r\nascends into the posterior nares. With the appropriate local\r\ndisinfection this form of the disease is neither so alarmingly\r\ndangerous as Oertel depicts it, nor so assuredly fatal as Roger but a\r\nfew years ago taught in his clinique, or as Kohts appears to\r\nbelieve,[38] yet it is ever grave. With energetic treatment many cases\r\nwill, however, get well. Diphtheria of wounds, complicating diphtheria\r\nof the pharynx, is always an unfavorable sign; that of the mouth and\r\nangles of the mouth, associating itself with a previously existing\r\ndiphtheria, having an indolent course, and producing more frequently a\r\ndeep impregnation of the tissues than a thick deposit, causes a\r\npainful and serious condition. Diphtheria of the larynx, whether it be\r\nof primary origin or the result of extension from the fauces, is\r\nnearly always fatal. In severe epidemics the mortality is 95 per cent.\r\nTracheotomy, too, saves but few of those who take the disease at such\r\na time. In fifty consecutive tracheotomies from 1872 to 1874 I did not\r\nsee one recovery. In the last few years I have seen few good results.\r\nIn average epidemics tracheotomy will save 20 per cent. A pulse of 140\r\nto 160, and high fever immediately after the operation, render the\r\nprognosis bad; so does absence of complete relief after the operation.\r\nAn almost normal temperature the day after the operation is an\r\nagreeable symptom, but does not exclude a downward extension of the\r\ndiphtheritic process, and hence cannot be looked upon as assuring a\r\nfavorable prognosis. A marked elevation of temperature is apt to\r\nindicate a renewed attack of diphtheria or a rapidly-appearing\r\npneumonia, and is an unfavorable symptom. A dry character of the\r\nrespiratory murmur some time after tracheotomy indicates the approach\r\nof death within from twelve to twenty-four hours from descent of the\r\nmembrane; so does cyanosis, whatever be its degree of intensity.\r\nDiphtheria of the trachea, which ascends to the larynx, is positively\r\nfatal. It has a rapid course, and tracheotomy only postpones the end\r\nfor a little while, if at all. The general health and strength of the\r\nlittle sufferer have no influence whatever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Gerhardt, _Handb. d. Kinderkr._, iii., 2, p. 20, 1878.]\r\n\r\nThick, solid deposits need not of themselves render the prognosis so\r\nunfavorable as do septic and gangrenous forms. Even in the nose they\r\n{693} are not of as serious import as the thin, putrid discharge. I\r\nhave seen recovery ensue in cases where I was obliged to bore through\r\nthe occluded nasal cavities with probes and scoops. Fetid, putrid\r\ndischarges are unfavorable, but in no wise fatal; conscientious\r\ndisinfection accomplishes a great deal. Slight epistaxis indicates the\r\npossibility of rapid absorption through the blood-vessels; but here,\r\ntoo, the final result depends on whether the disinfection be equally\r\nrapid and thorough. The same holds true for the sweetish, fetid odor\r\nof the breath, whether of the nose or mouth, which, on the one hand,\r\ndemonstrates the significance of the disease, while, on the other\r\nhand, it indicates the possibility of infection by inhalation.\r\n\r\nThe height of the fever is not in proportion to the danger in any\r\nindividual case; some have a favorable, some an unfavorable\r\ntermination, without fever of any account. Simple catarrh of the\r\npharynx and larynx frequently begins with a sudden and marked rise of\r\ntemperature; diphtheria in the same parts but rarely. There are cases,\r\nhowever, in which the height of the fever and the deposited membranes\r\nare in inverse proportion to each other. In these cases the fever may\r\nsubside rapidly, owing to a speedy elimination of the poison. Young\r\nchildren only are in danger of death from convulsions or a rapid\r\ntissue-degeneration due to hyperpyrexia. If the temperature rise\r\nsuddenly after some days of sickness, either a complication or a fatal\r\ntermination is to be apprehended. Yet, there are as many deaths in\r\ncases with comparatively low as with very high temperatures. Whether\r\ncollapse has resulted rapidly or slowly, the patient dies often with\r\nlow temperature. Thus, a rapid elevation is hardly a more unfavorable\r\nsign than a rapid fall. The pulse, too, may be very variable. True, a\r\nsmall, rapid, and irregular pulse is always unfavorable, because it\r\nindicates a weakening of the cardiac function; yet as long as it\r\nretains an approximately normal relation to the frequency of\r\nrespiration a rapid pulse gives no cause for alarm. Moreover, the\r\npulse is not always rapid when the strength gives way. It occasionally\r\nbecomes slower, and sometimes very slow, and may then become a\r\ndangerous symptom.\r\n\r\nEvery complication adds to the danger. Bronchitis and pneumonia are\r\nnot infrequent, yet I have seen cases of laryngeal diphtheria recover\r\nin which I had suspected pneumonia before performing tracheotomy, and\r\nwas enabled to diagnosticate it after operating. Albuminuria in the\r\nearly part of a diphtheritic attack with high fever is of little\r\nsignificance; nephritis, later in the course of the disease, partakes\r\nof the character of scarlatinous nephritis; cases of acute diffuse\r\nrenal disease are fortunately infrequent, and the remainder are very\r\nsubmissive to treatment. The cases of diphtheria complicated with\r\nendocarditis in my practice have ended fatally. An early affection of\r\nthe sensorium, not dependent on pressure upon the jugulars by greatly\r\nswollen glands, is an unfavorable symptom. Purpura, with profuse\r\nhemorrhages and a livid hue of the skin, is ominous; icteric\r\ndiscoloration, together with marked glandular and periglandular\r\ntumefaction, is absolutely fatal.\r\n\r\nMost cases of diphtheria of the pharynx and of the tonsils have a\r\nfavorable termination, yet a positive prognosis can in no case be\r\ngiven with certainty. Still, even in malignant epidemics the mortality\r\nis not very great, for even though there be a large number of severe\r\ncases in {694} any one epidemic, yet it is greatly overbalanced by the\r\nnumber of moderately severe and mild ones. True, not a few cases end\r\nfatally in several days, owing to the high fever, or to septic\r\nabsorption, or nephritis, or croup, but the majority of cases end in\r\nrecovery in one or two weeks. Yet diphtheria does not always take so\r\nregular a course; not infrequently, after the pulse has become\r\nstronger, the appetite improved, and the pharynx cleared, and the\r\npatient is apparently on the high road to recovery, another attack\r\noccurs accompanied by fever, as before, and a rapid formation of\r\nmembrane. Occasionally two or three such relapses may occur in the\r\ncourse of three, four, or five weeks; not to speak of the fact that\r\nthose who have once suffered from diphtheria are more susceptible to\r\nthe action of the poison than those who never suffered before.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Every case should be treated on general principles; thus,\r\nit is not possible to lay down a routine treatment for every\r\nindividual case. High fever should be reduced by sponging and bathing,\r\nquinia, and sodium salicylate; collapse speedily treated, and severe\r\nreflex symptoms, as vomiting, etc., checked at once. Whether to employ\r\nfor this purpose ether, wine, cognac, champagne, or coffee must be\r\ndecided by the physician in individual cases. The administration of\r\nthe remedy, whether by mouth, by injection into the bowels, or\r\nsubcutaneously, as I have employed cognac, ether, alcohol, and camphor\r\ndissolved in ether or alcohol, in some cases with decided and rapid\r\nsuccess, must depend on the condition of the organs and on the urgency\r\nof the case. However, all the above remedies are frequently of no\r\nservice, because administered too late and in too small doses. If I\r\nhave ever had cause to feel contented with the results of treatment in\r\ndiphtheria, it is owing to the fact that I lost no time. No medicines,\r\nhowever, must be resorted to which are apt to derange the digestion of\r\nthe patient; alcoholic stimulants must be given in fair dilution only,\r\nfor that reason. The nourishment of the patient is a matter of very\r\ngreat importance. On general principles it is true that care must be\r\ntaken in regard to food administered to febrile patients, but we must\r\nbear in mind that, when the lymphatic vessels are kept empty and no\r\nnew and proper material is introduced into them, the absorption of\r\nlocally-existing poisonous substances is proportionately increased.\r\nHungry lymph-vessels are the organism's fiercest enemies.\r\n\r\nI dwell particularly on the foregoing remarks for the reason that in\r\ndiphtheria, unlike certain diseases having a typical course and those\r\nof a simple inflammatory character, expectant treatment should not be\r\nindulged in. Oertel's advice, that when neither high fever nor\r\ncomplications are present we should quietly wait, and \"act only when\r\nnew and most alarming symptoms present themselves,\" is decidedly\r\nperilous. A mild invasion does not assure a mild course. Never has a\r\n\"possibly superfluous\" tonic or stimulant done harm in diphtheria, but\r\nmany a case has a sad termination because of a sudden change in the\r\ncharacter of the disease, putting the bright hopes of the physician to\r\nshame. Only the philosopher may be a passive spectator; the physician\r\nmust be a guardian. When I again read, in the work of the same\r\nmeritorious author, \"that when in exceptional cases, in children and\r\nyoung people, death is imminent, not from suffocating symptoms in the\r\nlarynx and trachea, but from septic disease and blood-poisoning, it is\r\nnecessary to resort to {695} powerful stimulants,\" it strikes me that\r\nhe is frequently too dilatory with his remedies, and, furthermore,\r\nthat his experience concerning the terrible septic form of diphtheria\r\nwhich is so frequently met with in some epidemics must have been very\r\nlimited at the time he was writing. In New York, during the past\r\ntwenty-five years, for every death from diphtheritic laryngeal\r\nstenosis (membranous croup) there have been three from diphtheritic\r\nsepsis or from exhaustion.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: We have to improve somewhat on the plan of Thomas\r\nWilson, though his general instructions be good (as laid down in his\r\n_Tentamen medicum inaugurale de cynanche maliqna_, Edinb., 1790, p.\r\n24): \"Cum hactenus nullum inventum est remedium quod contagionem in\r\ncorpus receptam suffocare possit; cum medicamenta pleraque quæ\r\nputredinem corrigere dicuntur, corpus ejusque functiones manifesto\r\nroborant; et denique cum hunc morbum comitantur virium prostratio, et,\r\netiam ab initio, summa functionum debilitas, qualis evacuantia\r\nomnigena prohibet, indicationem curandi unicam, scil. debilitatis\r\neffectibus obviam ire, proponam. Hinc corporis conditioni obviam itur\r\npræcipue tonica et stimulantia administrando.\" (As no remedy has yet\r\nbeen found which can extinguish the contagion after it has been\r\nreceived into the body; as most medicines which have the reputation of\r\ncorrecting putrefaction are roborants for the body and its functions;\r\nand, lastly, as this disease is attended with great prostration and\r\nsuch debility of functions as to preclude the use of all sorts of\r\nevacuants,--I propose but this one indication for treatment--viz. to\r\nmeet the effects of debility. This is fulfilled by the administration\r\nmainly of tonics and stimulants.)]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the dose of stimulants, it is a fact that there is more\r\ndanger in diphtheria from giving too little than too much. When the\r\npulse barely begins to be small and frequent they must be administered\r\nat once. A three-year-old child can comfortably take thirty to one\r\nhundred and fifty grammes (fl. oz. j-v) of cognac, or one to five\r\ngrammes of carbonate of ammonium, or a gramme of musk or camphor (gr.\r\nxv) and more, in twenty-four hours. In the septic form especially the\r\nintoxicating action of alcohol is out of the question; the pulse\r\nbecomes stronger and slower, and the patient enjoys rest. In those\r\ncases in which the pulse is slow, together with a weak heart's action,\r\nthe dose can hardly be too large. The fear of a bold administration of\r\nstimulants will vanish, as does that of the use of large doses of\r\nopium in peritonitis, of quinia in pneumonia, or of iodide of\r\npotassium in meningitis or syphilis. I know that cases of young\r\nchildren with general sepsis commenced immediately to improve when\r\ntheir one hundred grammes (fl. oz. iij) of brandy were increased to\r\nfour times that amount in a day.\r\n\r\nThe remarks I have made in reference to the general treatment of\r\ndiphtheria naturally render superfluous a discussion of the value of\r\nabstraction of blood. To be sure, it could only be a question of local\r\nbleeding. For nobody would dare to resort to jugular venesection, as\r\nour predecessors did in the last century. It may be safely asserted of\r\nthe latter that it has no influence on the process, but frequently\r\nincreases the local swelling and makes the patient more anæmic. There\r\nis no case in which a resort to it would not be criminal. I can\r\ndistinctly recall the time when bleeding and calomel formed the\r\ngroundwork of the treatment. Until the year 1862 the death-rate in\r\nRupert, Vermont, from diphtheria was 90 per cent., according to the\r\nreports of the local physicians, and particularly of my pupil, Dr.\r\nGuild, who at that time finished his studies in New York and commenced\r\npractising. When, in the same epidemic, bleeding and calomel were\r\nreplaced by stimulants and iron, with the chlorate of potassium, 90\r\nper cent. recovered.\r\n\r\nThat attention must be paid to the general condition mainly during a\r\n{696} retarded convalescence from previous sickness is self-evident.\r\nAny complications, too, must be subjected to early treatment.\r\nDiarrhoea must be mentioned among these; it reduces the patient's\r\nstrength very quickly; likewise, the early appearing nephritis, which\r\nmay suddenly end life.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I must allude to the great danger of\r\nself-infection, which may occur in every variety of cases, severe or\r\nmild. The poison is diffused by expiration and expectoration. Though\r\ncare may have been taken to disinfect the linen, towels,\r\nhandkerchiefs, the bedstead and bedding, chairs and wall-papers, and\r\ncarpets and curtains, even the clothing of the attendants will be\r\ninfected. While the patient is getting well he will be infected again,\r\nand have a more serious relapse; and a third one, and succumb. I have\r\nmet with such cases often, and with some which went from one attack\r\ninto another, and would certainly have perished but for their removal\r\nto a distant part of the town. Where there are vacant rooms the\r\nindication is to change rooms every few days and to thoroughly\r\ndisinfect (with sulphurous acid) that which has been used and\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nOne important axiom must be borne in mind--namely, that prevention is\r\neasier than cure. I do not refer simply to the removal of the healthy\r\nmembers of the family beyond the danger of infection or to the\r\nisolation of the patient. If the latter becomes necessary, the first\r\nindication is his removal to the top floor of the house. There are, in\r\naddition, however, certain prophylactic measures which will prove\r\nvaluable in the hands of every good physician. It is necessary under\r\nall circumstances that the mouth and pharynx of every child be\r\nconstantly kept in a healthy condition. Eruptions of the scalp must be\r\ntreated at once, and glandular swellings of the neck caused to\r\ndisappear. Some cases of laryngeal diphtheria have been traced\r\ndirectly to the presence of suppurating bronchial glands, with or\r\nwithout perforation.[40] The same rule applies to nasal and pharyngeal\r\ncatarrhs, the treatment of which should be commenced in warm seasons,\r\nwhen general or local remedies yield better results. Enlarged tonsils\r\nshould be resected, or, where that can not be done, scraped out with\r\nSimon's spoon, at a time when no diphtheritic epidemic is raging. It\r\nis important that this take place at a time when, even though sporadic\r\ncases of diphtheria occur, the danger of infection is not great; for\r\nduring the height of an epidemic every wound will give rise to general\r\nor local infection. This holds good for any part of the body as well\r\nas of the mouth. I avoid, therefore, an operation at such a time,\r\nprovided it can be postponed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Weigert, in _Virch. Arch._, vol. lxxvii., p. 294, 1879.]\r\n\r\nPrevention, after all, is not the business of the physician only, but\r\njust as much that of the individual or the complex of\r\nindividuals--viz. the town, the state, and the nation. Those sick with\r\ndiphtheria must be isolated, though the case appear ever so mild, and,\r\nif possible, the other children must be sent out of the house\r\naltogether. If that be impossible, let them remain outside the house,\r\nin the open air, as long as feasible, with open bedroom windows during\r\nthe night, in the most distant part of the house, and let their\r\nthroats, and those of their nurses, be examined every day. The\r\nwatching eye of a father or mother will discover deviations from the\r\nnorm, so that the physician can be notified. Let the temperatures\r\n{697} of the well children be taken once a day, toward evening. Ten\r\nminutes of a mother's time are well paid by the discovery of a slight\r\nanomaly which may require the attention of the physician. Happily,\r\nthere are now many mothers who keep and value a self-registering\r\nthermometer as an important addition to their household articles. The\r\nattendant upon a case of diphtheria must not get in contact with the\r\nrest of the family, particularly the children, after his visiting and\r\nhandling the patient, for the poison may be carried, though the\r\ncarrier remain well or apparently well. Unnecessary petting of the\r\npatient on the part of the well ought to be avoided, and kissing must\r\nbe forbidden; the bed-clothing and linen should be changed often and\r\ndisinfected, the air of the sick-chamber should be cool and often\r\nchanged, and if possible the chamber itself should be changed every\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nThe well or apparently well children of a family that has diphtheria\r\nat home must not go to school nor to church. The former necessity is\r\nbeginning to be recognized by the authorities and teachers, and also,\r\nin consequence of partially enforced habit, by parents; the latter\r\nwill be resisted longer. Schools ought to be closed entirely when a\r\nnumber of cases have occurred. Even when the school-children have not\r\nbeen affected to a great extent, but an epidemic of diphtheria has\r\ncommenced in earnest, it will be better to close the schools for a\r\ntime. If that be not advisable, the teacher ought to be taught to\r\nexamine throats, and directed to examine every child's throat each\r\nmorning, and to send home every one with even suspicious appearances.\r\n\r\nIn times of an epidemic every public place, theatre, ball-room,\r\ndining-hall, or tavern ought to be subjected to supervision. Where\r\nthere is a large conflux of people there are certainly many who carry\r\nthe disease with them. Disinfection must be enforced by the\r\nauthorities at regular intervals. Public vehicles must be treated in\r\nthe same manner. That it should be so when a case of small-pox has\r\nhappened to be carried in them appears quite natural. Hardly a\r\nlivery-stable keeper would be found who would not be anxious to\r\ndestroy the possibility of infection in any of his coaches. He must\r\nlearn that diphtheria is, or may be, as dangerous a passenger as\r\nvariola. And what is valid in the case of a poor hack is more so in\r\nthat of railroad-cars, whether emigrant or Pullman. They ought to be\r\nthoroughly disinfected in times of an epidemic, at regular intervals,\r\nfor the highroads of travel have always been those of epidemic\r\ndiseases, and railroad officers and their families have often been the\r\nfirst victims of the imported scourge. Can that be accomplished? Will\r\nnot railroad companies resist a plan of regular disinfection because\r\nof its expensiveness? Will there not be an outcry against this as\r\ndespotic and as a violation of the rights of the citizen? Certainly\r\nthere will be. But so there was also when municipal authorities began\r\nto compel parents to keep their children at home when they had\r\ncontagious diseases in the family, and when a small-pox patient was\r\narrested because of endangering the passengers in a public vehicle. In\r\nsuch cases it is not society that tyrannizes the individual; it is the\r\nindividual that endangers society. And society begins at last, even in\r\nAmerica, to believe in the rights of the commonwealth, and not in the\r\nrights of the democratic person only. The establishment of State and\r\nNational Boards of Health proves that the narrow-hearted theories of\r\nthe strict constructionists {698} have not only disappeared from our\r\npolitics, but also from the conscience and intellect of society.\r\n\r\nThe sick room must be kept cool, the windows kept open--more or\r\nless--by night as well as by day, the floor frequently washed, the\r\nlinen soaked at once, the excrements removed. Dead bodies ought to be\r\nkept moist, for infectious material, chemical or otherwise, will\r\nspread more easily when dry. Attendants must not talk unnecessarily\r\nover the mouth or diphtheritic wounds of the patient, and will do well\r\nto carry a little dry loose cotton--to be changed often--in each of\r\nthe nostrils, for it aids in protecting those who are necessarily\r\nexposed to infection.[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Wernich, in _F. Cohn's Beitr._, iii., 1859, p. 115.]\r\n\r\nA very important mode of prevention consists in disinfection. The\r\nexperiments of Schotte and Gaertner, and of Sternberg, prove the\r\ninefficiency of small doses of most of the disinfectants in common\r\nuse. The popular idea, sometimes even shared by physicians, that the\r\nfaint odor of chloride of lime or of carbolic acid in a sick room or\r\nin a foul privy is evidence that the place is disinfected, is entirely\r\nerroneous. Particularly in regard to the latter agent, it may be\r\nstated at once that its employment for disinfecting purposes on a\r\nlarge scale is impracticable, both on account of the expensiveness of\r\nthe pure acid and the enormous quantities required to produce the\r\ndesired effect. For in regard to its efficiency it does not rank very\r\nhigh in comparison with a great many other articles, as may be seen\r\nfrom a table of the disinfectant properties of different chemicals\r\npublished by Miquel in the _Semaine Médicale_.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes I know of no better or simpler rules for\r\ndisinfection than those published by the National Board of Health. In\r\nits _Bulletin_ No. 10, of September 6, 1879, the following\r\ninstructions for disinfection were published: Deodorizers, or\r\nsubstances which destroy smells, are not necessarily disinfectants,\r\nand disinfectants do not necessarily have an odor.\r\n\r\n\"Disinfection cannot compensate for want of cleanliness nor of\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\n\"I. Disinfectants to be employed:\r\n\r\n\"1. Roll-sulphur (brimstone) for fumigation.\r\n\r\n\"2. Sulphate of iron (copperas) dissolved in water in the proportion\r\nof one and a half pounds to the gallon; for soil, sewers, etc.\r\n\r\n\"3. Sulphate of zinc and common salt, dissolved together in water in\r\nthe proportion of four ounces sulphate and two ounces salt to the\r\ngallon; for clothing, bed-linen, etc.\"\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid is not included in the above list, for the following\r\nreasons: It is very difficult to determine the quality of the\r\ncommercial article, and the purchaser can never be certain of securing\r\nit of proper strength; it is expensive when of good quality, and\r\nexperience has shown that it must be employed in comparatively large\r\nquantities to be of any use; it is liable by its strong odor to give a\r\nfalse sense of security.\r\n\r\n\"II. How to use disinfectants:\r\n\r\n\"1. In the sick-room.--The most available agents are fresh air and\r\ncleanliness. The clothing, towels, bed-linen, etc. should, on removal\r\nfrom the patient and before they are taken from the room, be placed in\r\na pail or tub of the zinc solution, boiling hot if possible.\r\n\r\n\"All discharges should either be received in vessels containing\r\ncopperas {699} solution, or, when this is impracticable, should be\r\nimmediately covered with copperas solution. All vessels used about the\r\npatient should be cleansed with the same solution.\r\n\r\n\"Unnecessary furniture--especially that which is stuffed--carpets and\r\nhangings, should, when possible, be removed from the room at the\r\noutset; otherwise they should remain for subsequent fumigation and\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\"2. Fumigation with sulphur is the only practical method for\r\ndisinfecting the house. For this purpose the rooms to be disinfected\r\nmust be vacated. Heavy clothing, blankets, bedding, and other articles\r\nwhich cannot be treated with zinc solution should be opened and\r\nexposed during fumigation, as directed below. Close the rooms as\r\ntightly as possible, place the sulphur in iron pans supported upon\r\nbricks placed in wash-tubs containing a little water, set it on fire\r\nby hot coals or with the aid of a spoonful of alcohol, and allow the\r\nroom to remain closed for twenty-four hours. For a room about ten feet\r\nsquare at least two pounds of sulphur should be used; for larger rooms\r\nproportionately increased quantities.\r\n\r\n\"3. Premises.--Cellars, yards, stables, gutters, privies, cesspools,\r\nwater-closets, drains, sewers, etc. should be frequently and liberally\r\ntreated with copperas solution. The copperas solution is easily\r\nprepared by hanging a basket containing about sixty pounds of copperas\r\nin a barrel of water.\r\n\r\n\"4. Body- and bed-clothing, etc.--It is best to burn all articles\r\nwhich have been in contact with persons sick with contagious or\r\ninfectious diseases. Articles too valuable to be destroyed should be\r\ntreated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A. Cotton, linen, flannel, blankets, etc. should be treated with the\r\nboiling-hot zinc solution; introduce piece by piece; secure thorough\r\nwetting, and boil for at least half an hour.\r\n\r\n\"B. Heavy woollen clothing, silks, furs, stuffed bed-covers, beds, and\r\nother articles which cannot be treated with the zinc solution, should\r\nbe hung in the room during fumigation, their surfaces thoroughly\r\nexposed and pockets turned inside out. Afterward, they should be hung\r\nin the open air, beaten, and shaken. Pillows, beds, stuffed\r\nmattresses, upholstered furniture, etc. should be cut open, the\r\ncontents spread out, and thoroughly fumigated. Carpets are best\r\nfumigated on the floor, but should afterward be removed to the open\r\nair and thoroughly beaten.\r\n\r\n\"5. Corpses should be thoroughly washed with a zinc solution of double\r\nstrength; should then be wrapped in a sheet wet with the zinc\r\nsolution, and buried at once. Metallic, metal-lined, or air-tight\r\ncoffins should be used when possible; certainly when the body is to be\r\ntransported for any considerable distance.\r\n\r\n\"It might have been added here that no public funeral must be\r\npermitted.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection I have to speak of a remedy which I class among the\r\nprophylactic agents--namely, the chlorate of potassium or the chlorate\r\nof sodium. I cannot say that I rely on either of these remedies as\r\ncurative agents in diphtheria, and yet I employ them in almost every\r\ncase. The reason lies in the fact that the chlorate is useful in most\r\ncases of stomatitis, and thereby acts as a preventive.\r\n\r\nThere are very few cases of diphtheria which do not exhibit larger\r\nsurfaces of either pharyngitis or stomatitis than of diphtheritic\r\nmembrane. There are also a number of cases of stomatitis and\r\npharyngitis, {700} during every epidemic of diphtheria, which must be\r\nreferred to the epidemic, sometimes as kindred diseases, and sometimes\r\nas introductory stages only, which, however, do not, or do not in the\r\nbeginning, show the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1860,[42] I wrote my first paper on diphtheria, I based it\r\nupon two hundred genuine cases, and at the same time enumerated one\r\nhundred and eighty-five cases of pharyngitis, which I considered to be\r\nbrought on by epidemic influences, but which, the membrane being\r\nabsent, could not be classified as bonâ fide cases of diphtheria.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Amer. Med. Times_, Aug. 11th and 18th.]\r\n\r\nSuch cases of pharyngitis and stomatitis, no matter whether influenced\r\nby an epidemic or not, furnish the indication for the use of chlorate\r\nof potassium. They will usually get well with this treatment alone.\r\nThe cases of genuine diphtheria, complicated with a great deal of\r\nstomatitis and pharyngitis, also indicate the use of chlorate of\r\npotassium; not, however, as a remedy for the diphtheria, but as a\r\nremedy for the accompanying catarrhal condition in the neighborhood of\r\nthe diphtheritic exudation. For it is a fact that, as long as the\r\nparts in the neighborhood of the diphtheritic exudation are in a\r\nhealthy condition, there is but little danger of the disease spreading\r\nover the surface. Whenever the neighboring surface is affected with\r\ncatarrh or inflammation, or injured so that the epithelium gets loose\r\nor thrown off, the diphtheritic exudation will spread within a very\r\nshort time. Thus chlorate of potassium or sodium, the latter of which\r\nis more soluble and more easily digested than the former, will act as\r\na preventive rather than as a curative remedy. Therefore it is that\r\ncommon cases of pharyngeal diphtheria will recover under this\r\ntreatment alone; and these are the cases which have given its\r\nreputation to chlorate of potassium as a remedy for diphtheria.\r\n\r\nThe dose of chlorate of potassium for a child two or three years old\r\nshould not be larger than half a drachm (2 grammes) in twenty-four\r\nhours. A baby of one year or less should not take more than one\r\nscruple (1.25 grammes) a day. The dose for an adult should not be more\r\nthan a drachm and a half, or at most two drachms (6 or 8 grammes), in\r\nthe course of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the chlorate of potassium is partly a general and partly\r\na local one. The general effect may be obtained by the use of\r\noccasional larger doses, but it is better not to strain the\r\neliminating powers of the system. The local effect, however, cannot be\r\nobtained with occasional doses, but only by doses so frequently\r\nrepeated that the remedy is in almost constant contact with the\r\ndiseased surface. Thus, the doses, to produce the local effect, should\r\nbe very small, but frequently administered. It is better that the\r\ndaily quantity of twenty grains should be given in fifty or sixty\r\ndoses than in eight or ten; that is, the solution should be weak, and\r\na drachm or half a drachm of such solution can be given every hour or\r\nevery half hour or every fifteen or twenty minutes, care being taken\r\nthat no water or other drink is given soon after the remedy has been\r\nadministered, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nI have referred to these facts with so much emphasis because of late\r\nan attempt has been made to introduce chlorate of potassium as the\r\nmain remedy in bad cases of diphtheria, and, what is worse, in large\r\ndoses (Seeligmüller, Sachse, L. Weigert, C. Küster, Edlefsen.)\r\n\r\n{701} Large doses of chlorate of potassium (2 drachms daily to an\r\nadult I claim to be a large dose, particularly when its use is\r\npersisted in for many days in succession) are dangerous. In several of\r\nmy writings I have given instances of its fatal effects.[43] I have\r\nseen fatal cases since, and scores have been published in different\r\njournals. The first effects of a moderately large dose are gastric\r\nand, more especially, renal irritation; the latter it was which I\r\nexperienced when I took half an ounce twenty-five years ago. Fountain\r\nof Davenport, Iowa, experienced the same before more serious symptoms\r\ndeveloped, of which he died.[44] The symptoms are those of acute\r\ndiffuse nephritis, with suppression of urine, or scanty secretion of a\r\nlittle black blood, and uræmia deepening toward death in fatal cases.\r\nMy earlier cases I considered as primary diffuse nephritis, and I have\r\neven been inclined to attribute the frequent appearance of chronic\r\nnephritis, amongst all classes and ages, in part to the influence of\r\nthe chlorates, which have become a popular domestic remedy and are\r\nfound in every household. But the experimental researches of\r\nMarchand[45] and others prove that, at least in many instances, the\r\nextensive destruction of blood-cells is the first and immediate result\r\nof the introduction into the circulation of the chlorate, and that the\r\nvisceral changes are due to embolic processes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _C. Gerhardt's Handbuch der Kinderkrankheiten_, vol.\r\nii., 1876; _Med. Record_, March, 1879; _Treatise on Diphtheria_,\r\n1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Stillé, _Therap. and Mat. Med._, 2d ed., 1874, p. 922.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Sitzungsber. d. Naturforsch. Ges. h. u. Halle_, Feb. 8,\r\n1879, and _Virch. Arch._, vol. lxxvii.]\r\n\r\nSpecial Treatment.--The first axiom in the treatment of diphtheria is\r\nthat there is no specific; the second, that in no other disease the\r\nindividualizing powers of the physician are tested more severely.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is both internal and external. The local remedies are\r\neither such as dissolve the mucous membrane, or such as thoroughly\r\nmodify the mucous membrane from which the pseudo-membrane has been\r\nremoved, or real antiseptics, with the power of destroying either\r\nchemical or parasitic poisons.\r\n\r\nThe number of remedies recommended in diphtheria is immense. No other\r\nproof of its dangerous nature is needed. In the following I shall\r\nreview those which I consider it worth while either to reject or to\r\nrecommend.\r\n\r\nSteam is used partly to soften the membranes, but principally to\r\nincrease the secretion from the mucous membrane, and thereby throw off\r\nthe superjacent membrane. This can be done to advantage only where\r\nthere is a natural tendency to it; that is, where there are a great\r\nmany muciparous follicles under a cylindrical or fimbriated\r\nepithelium. This is the condition on part of the pharynx, but not on\r\nthe tonsils; and in a small portion of the larynx, in the trachea and\r\nbronchi, but not on the vocal cords. Wherever there is pavement\r\nepithelium on the normal surface, and where the membrane is imbedded\r\ninto the tissue, steam can hardly be expected to do good. In the other\r\ncases it will. Thus, the locality of the diphtheritic process\r\ndetermines to a great extent whether steam is indicated or not. If it\r\nbe used, the necessity of a full supply of atmospheric air must not be\r\ndisregarded. Steam, with an overheated room and without pure air, is\r\nliable to be as injurious as steam in pure air is beneficial in a\r\nnumber of cases.\r\n\r\n{702} There can be no better proof for the necessity of\r\nindividualizing, and the impossibility of treating all cases alike,\r\nthan the fact that many will do well under steam treatment, and others\r\nare certainly injured by it. I have repeatedly had the joy of seeing\r\nchildren with croup become less cyanotic after their removal from an\r\natmosphere of vapor, and I can readily see that pure atmospheric air\r\nwould be more agreeable and wholesome to a child with stenosis of the\r\nlarynx than an atmosphere laden with steam. Of course this remark does\r\nnot apply to cases of pseudo-croup and bronchitis, which are generally\r\nbenefited by a warm, moist atmosphere. Those, however, who deem it\r\njudicious to employ steam as a vehicle for carbolic acid, salicylic\r\nacid, chloride of sodium, chlorate of potassium, or lime, had best\r\nresort to the atomizer for applying these remedies. It can be used\r\nwithout trouble; most children are sufficiently intelligent to allow\r\nthe spray to be directed upon the fauces and larynx every ten or\r\nfifteen minutes in case of necessity. When it is deemed advisable to\r\nadminister steam, I warn against the use of gas stoves. They require a\r\ngreat deal more oxygen than an alcohol lamp, which ought to be\r\npreferred when a stove or slaking lime or hot iron or bricks immersed\r\nin water are not available.\r\n\r\nWater may be made serviceable in different ways. Its effect on the\r\nskin, when taken in large quantities, under normal or abnormal\r\ncircumstances, is a matter of daily experience. Copious perspiration\r\nis its immediate result. The very same effect is produced on the\r\nmucous membranes. In diphtheria, besides professional hydropathists, I\r\nknow of but one[46] who favors the plentiful use of water, 100-200\r\ngrammes (3-6 ounces) every hour or oftener, either by itself or mixed\r\nwith an alcoholic beverage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: C. Rauchfuss, in _C. Gerhardt's Handb. d. Kinderkr._,\r\niii. 2, 1878.]\r\n\r\nSevere inflammatory symptoms, such as redness of the throat, great\r\npain, swelling of the glands, require cold applications, either an\r\nice-bag or ice-cold cloths well pressed out and frequently changed.\r\nThey must, however, be placed where they can do most good--in\r\nlaryngeal diphtheria around the neck, in pharyngeal diphtheria with\r\nglandular swelling over the affected part. In the latter, therefore,\r\nthe flannel cloth which covers the whole of the application must be\r\ntied over the head, and not behind. When ice-bags are used, care is to\r\nbe taken lest they should be too large; if so, they will not affect\r\nthe desired spot at all. Small pieces of ice frequently swallowed are\r\ngreatly relished by the patient; water-ices in small quantities will\r\nrender the same service; ice-cream, in half-teaspoon or teaspoon doses\r\nevery five or ten minutes, adds to the necessary nutriment. When the\r\nfever is high and the surface hot, sponging with tepid or cold water,\r\nor water and alcohol, will mitigate both. For the cold bath or the\r\ncold partial pack (trunk and upper part of the thighs) the general\r\nindications hold good. As a rule, I favor the latter, for many cases\r\nhave such a tendency to debility and collapse that sometimes the\r\ncirculation of the surface of the body is badly interfered with by\r\ncold bathing. Therefore, a contraindication to cold bathing must be\r\nfound at once in cold feet, either before or after a bath. When,\r\nunfortunately, the feet do not recover their normal temperature in a\r\nvery short time, they ought to be warmed artificially, and the cold\r\nbath not repeated. In such cases the cold pack, however, is still\r\nindicated. A linen or cotton cloth, {703} large enough to cover the\r\ntrunk and half of the thighs, is dipped in cold water, well pressed\r\nout, and the body of the patient wrapped tightly in it. The arms\r\nremain outside; the whole body is then wrapped up in a blanket; the\r\nfeet may be warmed meanwhile when necessary, and the cold pack\r\nrepeated as often as required to reduce the temperature--viz. once\r\nevery five minutes, every half hour, every hour.\r\n\r\nThe contraindications to the use of cold have in part been alluded to.\r\nVery young infants bear it but to a limited extent. The beginning of\r\nrecovery contraindicates it, unless for some local cause; for\r\ninstance, an inflamed gland. The extensive use of cold water or ice is\r\nalso forbidden when there is no fever, where there is perhaps an\r\nabnormally low temperature, where we have to deal with the septic or\r\ngangrenous form of diphtheria, where the vitality is low and the\r\nmucous membranes pale or even cyanotic. In such cases, on the\r\ncontrary, while unlimited internal stimulation is required, the hot\r\nbath, or hot pack and hot injections into the bowel, will be found\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nLime-water, glycerine, lactic acid, pepsin, neurin, papayotin,\r\nchinolin, and pilocarpine are all solvents of pseudo-membrane, but\r\nwhether there is sufficient time and opportunity to produce a curative\r\neffect by every one of them is a question open for discussion. Of\r\nlime-water and glycerine I have employed a mixture of equal parts in\r\nconsiderably more than a hundred cases after the completion of\r\ntracheotomy, directing the remedy through an atomizer into and below\r\nthe canula, but cannot say that the descent of the membrane into the\r\ntrachea or bronchi was prevented by it. Lime-water may be used in the\r\nnose and throat as an injection, spray, or gargle, but its solvent\r\neffect is greatly diminished by the action of the carbonic acid of the\r\nbreath on the lime. I have no doubt that if water alone was used with\r\nthe same persistence as lime-water, its effects would be nearly the\r\nsame. Still, what little effect the minute dose of lime (1:800) in the\r\nlime-water may have may just as well be utilized. What I object to is\r\nthe omission of more powerful agents. If lime is to be used, slaking\r\nlime frequently in the presence of the patient is attended with vastly\r\nmore benefit, inasmuch as by that proceeding a large amount of\r\npowdered lime is projected into the air of the room and the mouth and\r\nrespiratory organs.\r\n\r\nLactic acid also, in from ten to twenty-five parts of water, has\r\nyielded no better results in my hands. Those cases of tracheotomy\r\nwhich I afterward treated with lactic acid spray terminated no better\r\nthan such as were treated with lime-water and glycerine. Of the\r\nsolvent effect of pepsin I have not been able to convince myself so as\r\nto recommend it. The accounts of neurin have not encouraged me to try\r\nit at all. Chinolin (tartrate) has been used locally by O.\r\nSeifert,[47] Müller, and others. It is said to remove the membranes\r\nand relieve the fever. For a gargle it is dissolved in five hundred\r\nparts of water, or it is mixed with ten parts of water and alcohol\r\neach, and applied by means of a sponge. To relieve the burning\r\nsensation ice is swallowed afterward. The local applications of\r\nalcohol have the same drawback. There are but few patients who do not\r\nsuffer intensely from its local contact.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Berl. klin. Woch._, Nos. 36, 37, 1883.]\r\n\r\nPapayotin has been recommended by Rossbach for the purpose of\r\ndissolving membranes in a one-half per cent. solution. It peptonizes\r\n{704} albuminoids, and macerates meat, intestinal worms, and croup\r\nmembranes in both neutral and feebly alkaline solution. In\r\nconcentrated solutions it has a caustic effect. It is recommended, not\r\nas an anti-diphtheritic, but merely as a solvent remedy.[48] Whatever\r\nreliance may have been placed upon it has, however, been jeopardized\r\nby Rossbach's remarks[49] on the variability of the preparations in\r\nthe market. Not only are the specimens very unequal, but each of them\r\nis variable, easily spoiled, and particularly affected by moisture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Berl. klin. Woch._, March 10, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Transactions of the Congress for Int. Medicine_, 1883,\r\np. 162.]\r\n\r\nMuriate of pilocarpine was recommended for this purpose three years\r\nago. It was praised by Juttmann as a specific, and has failed. The\r\nquackish recommendations of the drug have, indeed, earned for it a\r\ncertain amount of distrust which it does not deserve in all cases. It\r\nis expected to increase the secretion of the mucous membranes to such\r\nan extent as to float the pseudo-membranes. It sometimes succeeds in\r\nso doing, but only in those cases in which the membrane is deposited\r\nupon the mucous membranes. When the tissue is impregnated the drug\r\nfails. It also fails in septic cases, and mostly for the reason that\r\nit diminishes and paralyzes the heart's action. It ought, therefore,\r\nnever to be given unaccompanied with large amounts of stimulants.\r\nWhere the patient is strong, and the heart healthy, it may be tried; I\r\nknow that a few cases of moderate laryngeal diphtheria improved with\r\npilocarpine, steam, and turpentine inhalations. The dose is 1/30\r\ngrain, dissolved in water, every hour.\r\n\r\nTurpentine inhalations were recommended by C. Edel.[50] Fifteen drops\r\nof oil of turpentine are inhaled from a common inhalation apparatus,\r\nwhich is placed at a distance of three inches from the mouth of the\r\npatient, for a period of ten minutes every hour. He claims recoveries\r\nin from twelve to forty-eight hours. I allow the patient to remain in\r\nhis bed, and keep water boiling constantly on an alcohol lamp, on the\r\nstove, or over the gas. A tablespoonful of turpentine, more or less,\r\nis poured on the water, care being taken that nothing is spilled in\r\nthe fire. Thus the room is constantly filled with a penetrating odor\r\nof turpentine, which is not at all disagreeable, even when in great\r\nconcentration. The effects are very satisfactory indeed. Where\r\ncircumstances allowed or required it I have raised a tent over the\r\nbed, large enough not to give inconvenience to the patient and to\r\nadmit either the whole apparatus or the tube containing the mixed\r\nvapor of water and turpentine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Med. Rev._, Jan. 19, 1878.]\r\n\r\nAmmonium chloride may sometimes be used to advantage for its softening\r\nand liquefying effects. Its internal administration in bronchial and\r\ntracheo-laryngeal catarrh is so old that it has several times been\r\nobsolete. Of late, more stimulant effects have been attributed to it\r\nthan it actually possesses. But its liquefying action, in cases where\r\nthe secretion of mucus is defective and expectoration scanty and\r\nviscid, is undoubted. Thus it proves valuable in many cases of simple\r\ncatarrh, both when administered internally and inhaled. The latter\r\nmode I have often resorted to, and believe that its macerating\r\ninfluence has been of service to me in cases of laryngeal diphtheria.\r\nHalf a teaspoonful of the pure salt is spread on the stove or burned\r\nover alcohol {705} or gas. It evaporates immediately, and fills the\r\nroom or the tent with a white cloud, which, when dense, excites\r\ncoughing. But it does not irritate to any uncomfortable degree, and\r\nthe process may be repeated in an interval of an hour or more.\r\n\r\nNot all cases of diphtheria are septic or gangrenous, nor are all the\r\ncases occurring during an epidemic of the same type. Some have the\r\nwell-pronounced character of a local disease, either on the tonsils or\r\nin the larynx. The cases of sporadic croup met with in the intervals\r\nbetween epidemics present few constitutional symptoms, and assume more\r\nthe nature of an active inflammatory disease--very much like the\r\nsporadic cases of fibrinous tracheo-bronchitis. These are the cases in\r\nwhich mercury deserves to have friends, apologists, and even\r\neulogists. Calomel, 0.5-0.75 gramme (gr. viij-xij), divided into\r\nthirty or forty doses, of which one is taken every half hour, is apt\r\nto produce a constitutional effect very soon. Such doses, with minute\r\ndoses, a milligramme or more (gr. 1/60), of tartar emetic, or ten or\r\ntwenty times that amount of oxysulphuret of antimony, have served me\r\nwell in fibrinous tracheo-bronchitis. But the mucous membrane of the\r\ntrachea and bronchi is more apt to submit to such liquefying and\r\nmacerating treatment than the vocal cords. The latter have no\r\nmuciparous glands like the former, in which they are very copious. And\r\nwhile the tracheal membrane, even though recent, is apt to be thrown\r\nout of a tracheal incision at once, the pseudo-membrane of the vocal\r\ncords takes from six days to sixteen or more for complete removal.\r\nStill, a certain effect may even here be accomplished, for maceration\r\ndoes not depend only on the local secretion of the muciparous glands,\r\nbut on the total secretion of the surface, which will be in constant\r\ncontact with the whole respiratory tract. Thus, either on theoretical\r\nprinciples or on the ground of actual experience, men of learning and\r\njudgment have used mercury in such cases as I detailed above, with a\r\ncertain confidence.\r\n\r\nIf ever mercury is expected to do any good in cases of suffocation by\r\nmembrane, it must be made to act promptly. That is what the blue\r\nointment does not. In its place I recommend the oleate, of which ten\r\nor twelve drops may be rubbed into the skin along the inside of the\r\nforearms or thighs (or anywhere when their surface becomes irritated)\r\nevery hour or two hours. Or broken doses will be useful, such as given\r\nabove, or hypodermic injections of corrosive sublimate in 1/2 or 1 per\r\ncent. solution in distilled water, four or five drops from four to six\r\ntimes a day, or more, either by itself or in combination with the\r\nextensive use of the oleate, or with calomel internally. Lately, the\r\ncyanide of mercury has been recommended very strongly. I hardly\r\nbelieve that it will work more wonders than any other equally soluble\r\npreparation. Within the past few years the internal administration of\r\nbichloride of mercury has been resorted to more frequently and with\r\ngreater success than ever before. My own recent experience with it has\r\nbeen encouraging, and so has that of some of my friends. Wm.\r\nPepper[51] gave 1/32 grain of corrosive sublimate every two hours in a\r\nbad form of diphtheritic croup, with favorable result. But in this\r\nvery bad case, desperate though it was--child of five years, resp. 70,\r\npulse 160--large membranes, \"evidently from the larynx,\" had been\r\nexpelled before the treatment was commenced on the {706} seventh day\r\nof the disease. The remedy ought to be given in solution of 1:5000,\r\nand in good doses. A baby a year old may take one-half grain every day\r\nfor many days in succession, with very little if any intestinal\r\ndisorder and with no stomatitis.[52] A solution of the corrosive\r\nchloride of mercury in water is frequently employed of late as a\r\ndisinfectant. It acts as such in a dilution of 1:20,000. As healthy\r\nmucous membranes bear quite well a proportion of 1:2000-3000, any\r\nstrength between these extremes maybe utilized. A grain of the\r\nsublimate in a pint or more of water, with a drachm of table-salt,\r\nwill be found both mild and efficient. As a gargle or nasal injection\r\nit will be found equally good. But it has appeared to me that frequent\r\napplications give rise to a copious mucous discharge; hourly\r\ninjections into a diphtheritic vagina became quite obnoxious by such\r\nover-secretion, which ceased at once when the injections were\r\ndiscontinued. Thus, when it is desirable not only to disinfect but\r\nalso to cleanse the diseased surface, the injections with corrosive\r\nsublimate appear to yield a result inferior to less irritating\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Trans. Am. Med. Ass._, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Med. Record_, May 24, 1884.]\r\n\r\nChloride of iron is undoubtedly a valuable remedy in diphtheria, but\r\nin its administration it must by no means be forgotten that small\r\ndoses at long intervals are out of the question. I have not the least\r\ndoubt but that the failure of the remedy may be attributed in most\r\ncases to the fact that the doses were too small and administered too\r\nseldom. A dose of from five to fifteen drops, properly diluted, every\r\nfifteen minutes, half hour, or hour is indispensable for a proper\r\nestimation of its effects. Gargles are not of much service, for the\r\nsimple reason that they do not come into sufficient contact with the\r\naffected parts, and reach at the utmost to the anterior pillars of the\r\nsoft palate. A direct application of the remedy to the mucous membrane\r\nof the pharynx may also be desisted from, thereby avoiding any\r\nirritation, the internal administration at short intervals causing the\r\npharynx to be sufficiently influenced by local contact with the\r\nremedy. It must, of course, not be expected that the chloride will\r\nremove the membrane, but it can frequently be seen to reduce the\r\nhyperæmia and swelling and prevent the reproduction of exuded\r\nmaterial. The chloride of iron exerts a decided influence on the vital\r\ncontractility of the blood-vessels. This increased contractility\r\ncertainly assists in diminishing the rapidity of absorption of putrid\r\nfluids through the blood-vessels, which constitutes the principal\r\nsource of danger from the disease.\r\n\r\nIt cannot yet be positively asserted that the chloride of iron exerts\r\na direct effect on the lymphatic vessels. Naturally, this was claimed\r\nwhen the remedy was recommended, in the treatment of diphtheria, on\r\naccount of its therapeutic effects in erysipelas, with the\r\naccompanying inflammation of the lymphatic vessels of the skin.\r\nAlthough we know of no direct compression of the lymphatic vessels due\r\nto the action of the chloride, yet it may be assumed that perhaps the\r\ncompression of the blood-vessels exerts a similar influence upon the\r\nneighboring lymphatics. In consequence of this there would be an\r\nimpediment to the absorption and further development of poisonous\r\nsubstances in the lymph. The chloride, like the sulphate of iron, is a\r\ntolerably powerful disinfecting agent. If this observation be correct,\r\nit may go very far toward explaining the action {707} of the chloride\r\nof iron in septic diseases, which are accompanied by an exalted\r\nactivity of the lymphatic vessels and an increase of the white\r\nblood-corpuscles. Furthermore, Saase has endeavored to show that the\r\nferrous salts possess the power of converting oxygen into ozone. They\r\nshare this power with the blood-globules exclusively, and could hence,\r\nto a certain degree, supply a deficiency of the latter. Pokrowsky,\r\ntoo, has shown that iron increases the process of oxidation in the\r\nbody by demonstrating that in health there is an elevation of\r\ntemperature and an increase of the percentage of urea in the urine\r\nduring its administration. In anæmic persons, to whom iron has been\r\ngiven for the purpose of increasing the amount of blood, the above\r\nphenomena may be observed before this object is accomplished. Thus\r\niron appears to replace the blood-corpuscles to a certain extent. Now,\r\nin infectious disorders of the blood, where the red globules are\r\nperpetually menaced with destruction, it seems plausible that the\r\npreparations of iron should exert an antiseptic action.\r\n\r\nFinally, it has been found that of all the preparations of iron the\r\nchloride possesses the greatest power of stimulating the nervous\r\nsystem. Possibly this effect may be traced to an increase of the\r\narterial pressure in the nerve-centres. It has been said that this\r\neffect has been vividly illustrated in certain forms of chlorosis. If\r\nthis be true, iron would be all the more indicated in diphtheria,\r\nsince it would act as a prophylactic against a series of nervous\r\nphenomena that so frequently present themselves, both during and\r\nsubsequently to the diphtheritic process. Thus it is that for many\r\nyears the muriate of iron has constituted the main element, with me,\r\nof internal medication in most cases of diphtheria, both of the mild\r\nand the most dangerous septic type. A common formula is, for a child\r\nof two years,\r\n\r\n  Rx. Tinct. Ferri Chloridi fl. drachm ij;\r\n      Potass. Chlorat.      gr. xx;\r\n      Aquæ                  fl. oz. v;\r\n      Glycerin. Pur.        fl. oz. j. M.\r\n\r\nS. A teaspoonful every fifteen, twenty, or thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid exerts a powerful influence on the vitality of all\r\nliving elements, and hence also on rapidly proliferating epithelium,\r\nwhich constitutes a part of the diphtheritic membrane. It is of great\r\nadvantage for local use. Its local effect, undiluted or diluted with\r\nequal or larger parts of glycerine or alcohol, in shrinking and\r\nremoving membranes, is sometimes very useful; in mild solutions in\r\nwater (1/2, 1, or 2 per cent.) it is very efficient in nasal\r\ninjections or for external applications or mouth-washes. Rothe's\r\nprescription for external use is carbolic acid and alcohol each 2\r\nparts, water 10, tincture of iodine 1. Its internal administration to\r\nthe extent of five to twenty grains daily, given largely diluted, in\r\nsmall and frequent doses, is of less positive value.\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid, in a solution of 1:30-50, is caustic. A milder\r\nsolution, 1:200-300 relieves or removes foul odor from the nose or\r\nthroat, but it does not detach membranes or shorten the duration of\r\nthe disease, apparently. Internally, it acts no longer as a\r\ndisinfectant, but is changed into a salicylate and is an antipyretic.\r\nIt is then better to replace it by the sodium salicylate. With its\r\nadministration (for a child of 2 years 3 grains every hour until 20 or\r\n25 grains are taken) it ought not to be {708} forgotten that serious\r\nbrain troubles, collapse, and irregular and paralytic breathing, as\r\nwell as gastric and intestinal disturbances, may follow its use. It\r\nought not to be given without careful watching and the simultaneous\r\nfree use of alcoholic stimulants.\r\n\r\nBinz found, as the result of experiments with solutions of pure quinia\r\nvarying from one part in a hundred to one in a thousand, that the\r\nlatter sufficed to prevent the development of bacteria in fluids\r\ncapable of undergoing putrefaction; but even estimated thus, a patient\r\nwith eighteen pounds of blood would require one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight grains of quinia circulating therein in order to satisfy\r\nthe conditions of Binz's experiment. If Binz considers two grammes\r\n(half a drachm) of quinia per day sufficient for an individual\r\nweighing one hundred and twenty pounds, his calculation is founded on\r\nexperiments with dogs, in which septicæmia was avoided by the\r\ninjection of quinia. It is also necessary to bear in mind that Binz\r\nmakes a distinction with regard to the preparations of quinia\r\nemployed. He warns against the use of the bisulphate as being the most\r\ninactive. No matter which preparations are used--I prefer the\r\nmuriate--I have come to look upon quinia as of no great service in\r\nreducing the temperature in infectious fevers. The main indication for\r\nits use can only be found in inflammatory fevers. When it is given,\r\nhowever, salicylate of sodium may be added for a short time to obtain\r\na speedier effect.\r\n\r\nOn the part of bromine Wm. H. Thompson claims the following\r\nadvantages: 1. When applied locally, it promptly arrests fetor by\r\narresting directly the gangrenous process, and thus lessens risk from\r\nabsorption. 2. It acts as an anti-putrefactive likewise in the fluids\r\nof the body generally--_i.e._ blood, interstitial circulation, and\r\nsecretions--owing to its high rate of diffusibility, equal to that of\r\nsodium chloride itself. 3. It locally destroys the communicable\r\nproperty of the discharges, shown by the immunity of attendants from\r\nany sore throat when it is used, and from its checking the spread of\r\nthe disease in the locality. He orders two solutions to be used: the\r\nfirst of equal parts of Lawrence Smith's solutio bromini and of\r\nglycerine, applied with a hair pencil to the membrane, as gently as\r\npossible. Sometimes he uses the solution full strength. The brush\r\nshould be washed at once in water, and does not last more than one\r\nday, owing to the action of the bromine on the hair. If, however, the\r\nmembrane be very extensive and the parts much swollen or difficult to\r\nreach, he resorts instead to douching with a Davidson syringe, using\r\nhalf a drachm to one drachm of the solution to a pint of warm water.\r\nBy beginning gently with the stream directed against the buccal mucous\r\nmembrane, the child soon becomes accustomed to the current and allows\r\nit then to play against the deeper parts.\r\n\r\nInternally he orders from six to twelve drops of the solution in a\r\nhalf ounce of sweetened water, every hour, two, or three hours,\r\naccording to the urgency of the case, and continuously.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient way of making Smith's solution is: Take two ounces\r\nof a saturated solution of potassium bromide in water; add to this,\r\nvery slowly, in a bottle and with constant shaking, one ounce of\r\nbromine. It is better to add a part, and then let it stand a while\r\nbefore adding the rest; then fill up gradually, and with constant\r\nshaking with water, until it measures four ounces.\r\n\r\n{709} Ozone has been used as an anti-fermentative in inhalation during\r\nthree or five minutes every hour or two, by Jochheim.\r\n\r\nBoric (boracic) acid, in saturated (1:25) or milder solutions, has\r\nsome antiseptic effect. It is mild, and not very injurious when\r\nswallowed by necessity or mistake. In diphtheritic conjunctivitis it\r\nis valued highly, and in nasal injections I have found it very useful.\r\nIt is less repugnant than most other substances administered in that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSodium benzoate cannot be relied on either as an anti-diphtheritic nor\r\nas an anti-febrile. The doses which were recommended were two scruples\r\nor a drachm daily for a child a year old.\r\n\r\nSulphur has been used locally. It gives rise to coughing and vomiting.\r\n\r\nCubebs have been given in incredible doses, two drachms of the powder\r\nto a child a year old. The drug disorders the stomach and kidneys.\r\n\r\nLocal Treatment.--The mechanical removal of the membranes is not\r\npermissible unless they are almost detached. It is best to avoid their\r\nbeing cast off, unless partly loosened membranes in the larynx or\r\ntrachea afford an indication for an emetic. Scratching and eroding the\r\nmucous membrane of the neighborhood give rise to new deposits. Even\r\nafter spontaneous elimination of a membrane a new one may be formed\r\nwithin a few hours.\r\n\r\nTo cauterize a diphtheritic membrane or infiltration I consider wrong,\r\nunless I shall be able to do so thoroughly and to limit the action of\r\nthe caustic to the diseased surface. Therefore potassa or chromic acid\r\ncannot be utilized, because of the impossibility of limiting their\r\neffect. Nitrate of silver and mineral acids can be restricted in their\r\neffects, but these are not sufficiently thorough, particularly as but\r\nfew patients will consent to have the remedy applied properly. When I\r\ndo cauterize, I prefer a mixture of equal parts of carbolic acid and\r\nglycerine or the undiluted acid. The membrane crumbles and falls off\r\nin pieces. Force must never be used. Where it would be required in the\r\ncase of obstinate children mild washes must be employed instead of the\r\ncaustic. Besides, the internal medication detailed above meets every\r\nindication. When there is a slight swelling of the lymphatic glands,\r\ncold water or ice applications are usually all that is needed. The\r\nlatter should be made according to general indications. The glandular\r\nand peri-glandular swellings are less the result of an actual filling\r\nup with foreign matter than of secondary irritation. Ice has a happy\r\neffect in such cases, both on internal administration, in the form of\r\nfrequent small quantities of ice-water, ice-pills, ice cream, and iced\r\nmedicaments, and also externally by ice-cold cloths or india-rubber\r\nbags filled with ice.\r\n\r\nIn general, the treatment of the swelled glands must be both based on\r\nits causes and adapted to the present condition. The adenitis and\r\nperi-adenitis is of secondary nature, the irritation being in the\r\nmouth, pharynx, and nares. In these localities is where the main\r\ntreatment is required. The sooner the primary affection is removed or\r\nrelieved or rendered innocuous, the better it is for the secondary\r\ncomplaint. Frequent doses of chlorate of potassium or sodium, or\r\nbiborate of sodium in mild doses frequently repeated, according to the\r\nprinciples laid down in another part of this article, mouth-washes,\r\ngargles, nasal injections with water, salt water, or solutions of\r\ndisinfecting substances, are not only {710} indicated, but highly\r\nsuccessful. When the case is recent, cold applications are required,\r\nbut no washes. When it is of older date, stimulant embrocations are in\r\norder. Iodine ointments are absorbed but slowly; mercurial plasters do\r\ngood in some cases; iodide of potassium dissolved in glycerine\r\n(1:3-4), frequently applied, iodine in oleic acid (1:8-12), iodoform\r\nin collodion or flexible collodion (1:12-15) applied twice daily, the\r\nlatter frequently with very good result, are beneficial. Copious\r\nsuppuration is very rare. Cases in which a free incision meets with an\r\nabscess ready to heal are very uncommon. But numerous small abscesses\r\nwith gangrenous walls and pus mixed with a sero-sanguinolent or\r\nsero-purulent liquid, are more frequently found. In such cases a probe\r\nintroduced into the lancet wound enters easily into the broken-down\r\ntissue in every direction, to a distance even of three to six\r\ncentimetres, (several inches), according to the size of the\r\ntumefaction. I have seen fatal hemorrhages from such gangrenous\r\ndestructions; therefore the treatment must be both timely and\r\nenergetic. The incision must not be delayed too long. When the skin\r\nassumes a purplish hue or is simply discolored, it is time to incise\r\nand to apply concentrated or nearly concentrated carbolic acid to the\r\ninterior, unless the neighborhood of very important blood-vessels or\r\nnerves yields a contraindication to concentrated applications. In that\r\ncase a milder preparation is advisable, but the application should be\r\nrepeated often, until the suppuration becomes more normal. Then mild\r\ndisinfectant injections into what has now become a cavity will be\r\nfound satisfactory, particularly when meanwhile the general condition\r\nof the patient has been improved.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Nasal Diphtheria.--Especially during the prevalence of an\r\nepidemic of diphtheria must we be careful not to allow a nasal catarrh\r\nto have its own way; we must likewise guard against considering the\r\nthin and flocculent discharge in infected cases as a mucous secretion.\r\nWhatever be the origin of nasal diphtheria, whether primary or the\r\nresult of a similar affection in the throat, local treatment should at\r\nonce be instituted, and if this be done the great majority of cases\r\nwill terminate favorably. The danger in this form of disease consists\r\nin an excessive absorption of putrid substances and in the breathing\r\nof contaminated air. The interior of the nasal cavities must be\r\nthoroughly cleaned and disinfected. If this be commenced early, the\r\noriginal seat of the affection may be reached, and the disinfectant\r\nprocess will, as a rule, have good results. It is not necessary to\r\nselect very energetic disinfectants; a solution of twelve to\r\ntwenty-five centigrammes (two to four grains) of carbolic acid in\r\nthirty grammes (an ounce) of water is at once mild and effective, and\r\nhardly gives rise to more discomfort than lukewarm water. Nasal\r\ninjections must be made very frequently, until each time the stream of\r\nfluid has a free exit through the other nostril or through the mouth.\r\nThey must be made at least every hour, and even oftener if necessary;\r\nat the same time it is advisable to be careful that the fluid does not\r\nenter the Eustachian tube. This can be prevented, to a certain extent,\r\nby compelling the patient to keep the mouth open during the procedure.\r\nI have seldom seen evil or even disagreeable results from the\r\nadministration of nasal injections in diphtheria. It is likely that\r\nthe mucous membrane of the pharynx is swollen as far as the openings\r\nof the Eustachian tubes to such a degree as to render the entrance of\r\nfluids into the latter improbable. {711} The hardness of hearing,\r\nwhich is of so frequent occurrence in the course of a severe catarrh\r\nor of a diphtheritic attack, seems to indicate that the mucous\r\nmembrane of that part is in a state of swelling. An ordinary syringe\r\nwill suffice. However, when administered by parents or nurses the\r\nblunt nozzle of an ear syringe is preferable. Occasionally here, as in\r\nlocal applications to the mouth and pharynx, the atomizer may be used\r\nto advantage, but the tube must be properly introduced into the\r\nnostrils. There are cases of nasal diphtheria, however, which are far\r\nmore troublesome to manage than the foregoing would seem to indicate.\r\nI have seen cases in which the nasal cavities, from the anterior to\r\nthe posterior nares, were filled and completely occluded by a dense,\r\nsolid membranous mass. I was then compelled to bore a passage with a\r\nsilver probe, to gradually introduce a larger-sized one, and then to\r\napply the pure carbolic acid, in order to remove the densest and\r\nthickest masses, and finally was able to make injections; even in such\r\ncases I have had the gratification of being able to give a favorable\r\nprognosis. The dangerous secondary swelling of the glands will often\r\nsubside after a steady employment of disinfectant injections for from\r\ntwelve to twenty-four hours. It will be found that children frequently\r\ndo not object to this method of treatment; I have even met with some\r\nwho, after convincing themselves of the relief afforded thereby, asked\r\nfor an injection. When we are about to bring each injection to a close\r\nit is well to press together the nasal cavities for an instant with\r\nthe fingers. By this procedure the fluid is forced backward to the\r\npharynx, and is swallowed or ejected through the mouth, and thus\r\nwashes the pharynx and mouth at the same time. Frequently, however,\r\nthis latter object is obtained with every injection; for, the palate\r\nbeing swelled, oedematous, and paretic, the fluid is not prevented\r\nfrom reaching the pharynx, even in the average case. In regard to the\r\nchoice of a disinfecting agent, I have but a few words to say. I\r\nbelieve that no one of them has important qualifications above the\r\nothers. I avoid those which stain or which produce firm coagula. For\r\nthe latter reason I do not use the subsulphate and perchloride of\r\niron; for the former, the permanganate of potassium. I employ, as a\r\nrule, carbolic acid in solution, of the strength above mentioned.\r\nWhere there is but a slightly fetid odor I have frequently employed\r\nlime-water or water with glycerine, or a solution (1:100, 1:50) of\r\nchloride of sodium, or of bicarbonate of soda or of borax, or a\r\nsaturated solution of boric acid. Disinfecting agents and antiseptics,\r\nwhether carbolic acid, salicylic acid, or iron, are of no service when\r\nadministered internally only, unless the seat and cause of the septic\r\ninfection be attended to previously. Under the local employment of\r\nantiseptics, as described, or by simply washing out with water or salt\r\nwater, most cases recover; without them, death will result. Of late,\r\nin many cases, the local applications, injections, etc. of the\r\ncorrosive chloride of mercury in water (1:5000-10,000) has proved very\r\neffective. It has this advantage over carbolic acid, that the\r\nswallowing of the former is not so dangerous. This much, after all, my\r\nexperience has assured me of, that there is a certain number of cases\r\nwhich terminate fatally; but it is likewise true that the mortality\r\nneed not be excessively great. I cannot grant that it is hard to carry\r\nout the exact and apparently barbarous treatment necessary for a\r\nfavorable result, for it is certainly more barbarous to sacrifice than\r\nto save life.\r\n\r\n{712} It is a positive fact that when children suffering from nasal\r\ndiphtheria, with its peculiarly septic character, are permitted to\r\nsleep much--and they are apt to be drowsy under the influence of the\r\npoison--they will certainly die. To allow them to sleep is to allow\r\nthem to die.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of improvement is often a rapid diminution of the\r\nglandular swelling wherever it exists. It is not present in all cases,\r\nbut chiefly in those in which a bloody serum was discharged in an\r\nearly period of the disease. In these the blood-vessels appear to be\r\nvery vulnerable, superficial, and apt to absorb; these are also the\r\nmost dangerous cases, and require the greatest attention and care, and\r\nalso prompt disinfection.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Laryngeal Diphtheria.--The severest form of diphtheria is\r\nthat located in the larynx, constituting membranous croup. Its general\r\ntreatment, whether the disease has originated primarily in the larynx\r\nor trachea or has been communicated from the pharynx, does not differ\r\nfrom that laid down for diphtheria in general. Naturally the larynx\r\ncalls for special treatment on account of the symptoms of suffocation\r\nwhich result from its stenosis. The main indication of removing viscid\r\nmucus or partly-detached membranes is best met by the administration\r\nof an emetic. Such is their only indication in my experience. The\r\nselection of the emetic, when indicated, is of great importance.\r\nAntimonials ought to be avoided because of their depressing and\r\npurgative effect. Ipecacuanha is but rarely effective. The sulphates\r\nof zinc and copper, and particularly the latter, deserve preference.\r\nTurpeth mineral acts promptly and satisfactorily. When no emesis can\r\nbe obtained the prognosis is decidedly bad. Recourse must then be had\r\nto tracheotomy, the good results of which are however only too often\r\ndelusive and transient.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the operation, there is scarcely any relief, and\r\nparticularly when the case takes a very rapid course, it is probably\r\none of ascending croup which commenced in the trachea. Mechanical\r\nrelief by pushing down a hen's feather or a bundle of them, and\r\nturning it about and twisting, must be tried. It is a much better\r\ninstrument than pincers of all sorts and shapes. But what relief will\r\nbe accomplished is but of very short duration. When fever sets in\r\nwithin a few hours it means very much more frequently pneumonia than\r\ndiphtheritic fever. It is apt to be soon complicated by that\r\ndisproportion between pulse and respiration so characteristic of\r\ninflammatory diseases. Then quinia in larger doses, 0.25 or 0.5 (grs.\r\niv-viij) every two, four, eight hours, at the same time doses of\r\nsodium salicylate 0.25-0.40 (grs. iv-vj) every hour or two hours until\r\nthe temperature goes down, and small doses of digitalis where the\r\nheart requires it, must be given at once. Procrastination is\r\ndangerous; the patients want careful watching; many of them die within\r\ntwo days after the operation.\r\n\r\nDiphtheritic conjunctivitis requires great attention and permits of no\r\nloss of time. Cold applications to the affected eye must be made\r\nconstantly. Pieces of linen or lint kept on ice (better than in\r\nice-water) of little more than the size of the eye, must be changed\r\nevery minute or two day and night. The danger to the cornea is so\r\nimminent that constant watchfulness is required. Boric acid in\r\nconcentrated solution should be dropped into the eye once every hour.\r\nCare must be taken that the well eye shall not get infected; for that\r\npurpose it is best to cover it {713} with lint and collodion, or with\r\nlint or cotton held in place by adhesive plaster.\r\n\r\nCutaneous diphtheria requires the destruction of the membrane or of\r\nthe infected surface by carbolic acid, either concentrated or somewhat\r\ndiluted with glycerine, or the application of the actual cautery.\r\nAfter that the use of ice or iced cloths, or diluted carbolic acid, is\r\nindicated. As soon as the surface is no longer diphtheritic the local\r\nand general treatment is to be continued on general principles.\r\n\r\nDiphtheritic paralysis is invariably complicated by anæmia and\r\ndebility, and the diet and medical treatment must be regulated\r\naccordingly. However, neither overfeeding nor a sameness of diet are\r\nto be permitted, for not rarely the muscular coat of the stomach\r\nsuffers with the rest of the muscular tissue, and the secretion of\r\ngastric juice is very deficient in anæmic individuals. While,\r\ntherefore, iron is indicated, we must not neglect to pay particular\r\nattention to nutrition and digestion, and to aid the latter with\r\npepsin and moderate amounts of muriatic acid, well diluted. Quinia in\r\nsmall doses and stimulants are appropriate whenever there is no\r\ncontraindication to their employment. The treatment of the paralysis\r\nitself will naturally depend on the diagnosis of the condition present\r\nin each individual case, which we have seen to differ considerably.\r\nThis alone can explain why various modes of treatment, the electric\r\ncurrent among others, after being recommended by some authors, are\r\nbranded by others. Where we have to deal with those rare changes in\r\nthe brain and spinal cord, the utmost care is necessary in order not\r\nto make the condition still worse; and in such cases there would be a\r\ncontraindication to the use of the faradic current, though this would\r\nnot hold true with regard to the use of the galvanic current in short\r\nsittings. Besides, central paralyses are by no means so frequent as\r\nperipheral ones. In most cases there is not the slightest elevation of\r\ntemperature during the course of the paralytic phenomena. I lay great\r\nstress upon this point, for I am aware that many cases of central\r\ncongestion and even of inflammation exhibit but very insignificant\r\nelevations of temperature. But, as the diagnosis will depend on a\r\npositive knowledge of whether there have been changes of temperature,\r\nI rely on the rectal temperature only, for many a myelitis runs its\r\ncourse with no greater elevation above the normal than one-half or one\r\ndegree. In all cases in which the temperature is normal or subnormal,\r\nI do not hesitate for a moment to employ the faradic or the galvanic\r\ncurrent. In addition to the internal administration of iron I advise\r\nby all means the employment of strychnia. When there is no necessity\r\nfor haste, we may give moderate doses, gradually increasing them, and\r\nusing iron in combination. When there is danger in delay, recourse\r\nought to be had to subcutaneous injections of the sulphate of\r\nstrychnia, once or twice daily. They are mainly indicated in paralysis\r\nof the muscles of deglutition and of respiration. Of course, where the\r\nformer are affected it is necessary to nourish the patient\r\nartificially, partly perhaps by nutrient enemata, but principally by\r\nmeans of the stomach-tube. In using the latter it is unnecessary to\r\nintroduce it into the stomach, as it only requires to be passed a few\r\ninches below the affected parts, when the oesophagus will usually be\r\nfound able to undertake the further disposal of the food. In these\r\ncases strychnia should be injected subcutaneously in the neck, {714}\r\nonce or twice daily. In a similar manner it should be injected in the\r\nregion of the chest, diaphragm, or neck in paralysis of the\r\nrespiratory muscles or of the glottis. In paralysis of the muscles of\r\naccommodation (in which Scheby-Buch claims to have seen the process\r\ncut short by the use of the Calabar bean, considered as inert by\r\nHassner) they may be given in the forehead or temples.\r\n\r\nFrictions dry and alcoholic, hot bathing, friction with hot water,\r\nkneading of the affected parts, will be found beneficial and pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{715}\r\n\r\nCHOLERA.\r\n\r\nBY ALFRED STILLÉ, M.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Cholera is an epidemic disease, characterized by the\r\ntransudation of serum into the stomach and bowels, and usually by the\r\nprofuse discharge by vomiting and purging of a liquid resembling\r\nrice-water, followed by a tendency to collapse. It is endemic in\r\nIndia, but has been conveyed thence to almost every part of the world.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Cholera algida, C. asiatica, C. asphyxia, C. maligna, C.\r\nspasmodica. In English it is generally spoken of as Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--It is sometimes stated that Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus, and\r\nthe Greek, Roman, and Arabian medical writers generally record \"the\r\nfact of the presence of cholera in the various countries in which they\r\nlived\" (Macnamara). Nothing could be more contrary to the truth. All\r\nof these writers describe \"cholera morbus\" in nearly identical terms;\r\nthey all include bilious discharges among its symptoms, and no one of\r\nthem speaks of it as a mortal or even as an epidemic disease.\r\n(Compare, especially, Celsus, Aretæus, Cælius Aurelianus, and Paulus\r\nÆgineta.) Their description of sporadic cholera morbus is very\r\nprecise. For example, Cælius Aurelianus says: \"Cholericam passionem\r\naiunt aliqui nominatam a fluore fellis, per os et ventrem effecto.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Acut. Morb._, lib. iii. cap. xix.]\r\n\r\nAsiatic epidemic cholera is a very different disease. It seems to have\r\nbeen known in India from a very remote period, but no detailed account\r\nof it was published until the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\nDuring that century many successive descriptions of the disease\r\nexhibited its extreme violence and mortality. It is believed to have\r\noccurred repeatedly, if not annually, in the same localities down to\r\nthe present time. The invasion of India by the Portuguese, and\r\nafterward by the English, contributed to spread the disease throughout\r\nthe Peninsula, partly by military occupation and partly through\r\ncommercial channels, by which it was also carried to the islands in\r\nthe Indian Ocean. It prevailed in Batavia in 1629. Between 1768 and\r\n1790 numerous epidemics of cholera occurred. About the former date no\r\nless than 60,000 persons are said to have perished near Pondicherry,\r\nand in 1783 it is reckoned that 20,000 victims to the disease fell in\r\na single week during the religious gathering at the sacred city of\r\nHurdwâr, where, as will be seen hereafter, it became in later years\r\nmore fatal still. The English armies extended their conquests in\r\nHindostan, and established commerce between that country and Western\r\nAsia and Europe, and by the year 1817 opened new channels of {716}\r\ncommunication in every direction, both within and beyond the\r\nPeninsula. Along them the disease was carried; it invaded Ceylon and\r\nthe Burmese empire, and extended to Batavia, Java, and China on the\r\neast, and advanced westward to Persia in 1821. In that year also it\r\nwas carried from Arabia into Africa, and at various later periods\r\npenetrated more and more deeply into the Dark Continent, always\r\nfollowing the track of pilgrims returning from Mecca, the routes of\r\narmies engaged in war, or those of trading caravans.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Christie, _Cholera Epidemics in Africa_, 1876.]\r\n\r\nIn these cases, as in others elsewhere, the spontaneous origin of the\r\ndisease has been assumed by certain writers, but at every stage of its\r\nprogress careful investigation led uniformly to the conclusion that it\r\nwas propagated directly or indirectly from pre-existent cases of\r\ncholera. From Persia it moved northward as far as the shores of the\r\nCaspian Sea, and westward to the Levant in 1823, and there for a time\r\nits ravages were stayed. Meanwhile, it prevailed at various places\r\nthroughout Hindostan, and, assuming a greater degree of violence in\r\n1826, it advanced steadily in a north-western direction across\r\nAfghanistan and Persia in the following year. In 1829 it reached\r\nOrenburg, to the north of the Caspian Sea, and was speedily conveyed\r\ninto the interior of the Russian empire, where it raged with great\r\nviolence in 1830. In 1831 it prevailed at Mecca among the pilgrims,\r\nwho had brought it from India, and so virulently that one-half of them\r\nare computed to have perished. Hence it speedily passed with returning\r\npilgrims to Alexandria and Constantinople, and was carried to St.\r\nPetersburg, to Sweden, to Hamburg, and other places in Northern\r\ncontinental Europe. From Hamburg and other seaports it was conveyed to\r\ncommercial towns on the eastern coast of England, whence it extended\r\nto Edinburgh in the north and London in the south.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 cholera prevailed in France, and within the year caused\r\n120,000 deaths, 7000 of which occurred in Paris in the space of\r\neighteen days. In the spring and summer of that year it was reproduced\r\nin England, and extended to Ireland. From Liverpool, Cork, Limerick,\r\nand Dublin five vessels filled with emigrants sailed for Quebec,\r\nCanada, and they, together, lost 179 passengers by cholera during the\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nThe immediate results of this importation and first appearance of\r\ncholera on the American continent are described by Dr. Peters as\r\nfollows: \"All these ships and their passengers were quarantined at\r\nGrosse Isle, a few miles below Quebec. On June 7th the St. Lawrence\r\nsteamer Voyageur conveyed a load of these emigrants and their baggage,\r\nsome to Quebec, but the majority to Montreal on the 10th. The first\r\ncases of cholera occurred in emigrant boarding-houses in Quebec on the\r\n8th, and the same pest-steamboat, the Voyageur, landed persons dead\r\nand dying of cholera at Montreal, a distance of two hundred miles, in\r\nless than thirty hours. Over this long distance, thickly inhabited on\r\nboth shores of the St. Lawrence, cholera made a single leap, without\r\ninfecting a single village or a single house between the two cities,\r\nwith the following exceptions. A man picked up a mattress thrown from\r\nthe Voyageur, and he and his wife died of cholera; another man,\r\nfishing on the St. Lawrence, was requested to bury a dead man from the\r\nVoyageur, and he and his wife and nephew died. The captain of a\r\npassing boat requested an Indian to bury a man from on board; this man\r\nand five other Indians were attacked {717} and died. The town of Three\r\nRivers, halfway between Quebec and Montreal, forbade steamers to land,\r\nand escaped for a long time. From Montreal the great influx of\r\nemigrants were forwarded away, by the Emigrant Society, as fast as\r\nthey arrived, and by them the pestilence was sown at each\r\nstopping-place. Kingston, Toronto, and Niagara soon became affected.\r\nIn the end, over 4000 persons died of cholera in Montreal, and more\r\nthan an equal number in Quebec. The epidemic reached Detroit in the\r\nsame way, ... and continued west along the Great Lakes, until in\r\nSeptember it reached our military posts on the Upper Mississippi....\r\nFort Dearborn, near Chicago, was temporarily reoccupied in 1832, and\r\nit was here that epidemic cholera displayed its most fatal effects\r\namong our troops. Out of 1000 men, over 200 cases were admitted into\r\nhospitals in the course of seven or eight days.... When these troops\r\nagain marched for the Mississippi, they appeared in perfect health,\r\nyet the cholera broke out again on the way, and when the command\r\nreached the Mississippi it had been as fatal as it had been at Fort\r\nDearborn.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, an emigrant ship with cholera on board reached New York,\r\nwhence the disease spread up the Hudson River, and was also carried\r\nsouthwardly to Philadelphia and the West. The mortality in New York\r\nCity from this epidemic is stated at 3500. In 1833 the disease broke\r\nout in the cities of Havana and Matanzas in Cuba, and is said to have\r\ndestroyed one-tenth of the entire population. Hence it was carried to\r\nMexican and American towns on the Gulf of Mexico, and up the\r\nMississippi and Ohio as far as the western border of Pennsylvania. In\r\nthe following year it was again introduced at the port of Quebec by a\r\nvessel filled with emigrants, of whom many had died during the\r\npassage. It prevailed in Canada and the State of New York and spread\r\nover the whole country in 1835 and 1836. In the former of these two\r\nyears it was confined to several Southern cities, whither it was\r\nbrought, as on a former occasion, directly from Cuba. It then\r\ngradually subsided, and at last disappeared for the space of nearly\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nBut in 1845 it was known to be advancing on its former path, which it\r\nsteadily pursued, and entered England in October, 1848, at Sunderland,\r\nthe very town at which it first appeared in 1831. \"During the second\r\nepidemic in Europe, in 1848, two vessels sailed from Havre, where\r\ncholera prevailed--one, the New York, for New York, and the other, the\r\nSwanton, for New Orleans. Both contained large numbers of German\r\nemigrants. On one vessel the cholera appeared when it was sixteen days\r\nout, with fourteen deaths; on the other, in twenty-six days, with\r\nthirteen deaths. The New York arrived at Staten Island Dec. 2, 1848,\r\nand a severe epidemic broke out, but was confined to the quarantine\r\ngrounds. The Swanton arrived at New Orleans Dec. 11th; no quarantine\r\nwas instituted, and in two days its sick were taken into the Charity\r\nHospital. This was the beginning of a severe epidemic, which increased\r\nin power all winter, till, in June, 1849, 2500 died of it in New\r\nOrleans. December 20, 1848, it reached Memphis by steamboat from New\r\nOrleans, and for twenty-five days was confined to the landing-place of\r\nthe former city, whence it afterward spread. In the spring it was\r\ncarried to St. Louis and Cincinnati and the whole Mississippi Valley.\r\nIn October it reached Sacramento, Cal., by means of overland\r\nemigrants, and, almost at the same time, San Francisco, by the U.S.\r\nsteamer Northerner from {718} Panama. The Chinese of California\r\nsuffered most severely\" (Peters). In April, 1849, cholera reappeared\r\nin the public stores at the quarantine station, Staten Island, N.Y.,\r\nand in the city of New York, where it was fatal to 5000 persons.\r\n\r\nA pause now took place in the ravages of the disease which lasted\r\nuntil 1853. In that year it destroyed no less than 11,000 persons in\r\nthe Persian city of Teheran. At Messina its victims numbered 12,000,\r\nin France 114,000, and in England about 16,000. In 1854 it was\r\nintroduced by emigrant ships into New York, causing a mortality of\r\n2000 persons, and was carried to Philadelphia, where its victims\r\nnumbered 500. It extended to many towns in New England and westward\r\nalong the great channels of emigration. In Montreal the deaths were\r\n1300, and in the then small town of Detroit, 1000.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of quiescence longer than any previous one the\r\ncholera again broke out among the pilgrims to Mecca in December, 1864.\r\nIt appeared in Alexandria during May, 1865, and thence was carried to\r\nmany parts of Europe, and from them to North America and the West\r\nIndies. This period of exemption included that of the Civil War in the\r\nUnited States, when, if ever, the local causes which have been\r\nerroneously assigned to the disease existed in all their forms and in\r\nthe most intense degree. It was only when its specific germs were once\r\nmore imported that cholera began to prevail again. Official records\r\nshow that in 1866 it was introduced from Europe into Halifax, N.S.,\r\nthe city of New York, and the military posts of New York harbor.\r\nThence it was carried in troop-ships to various Southern ports, from\r\nwhich its progress could be traced to Texas and other Gulf States, and\r\nto the towns on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. From New York,\r\nalso, the disease travelled westward to Cincinnati and the U.S.\r\nbarracks at Newport, on the opposite side of the Ohio River, whence it\r\nadvanced in a south-westerly direction to meet the trail that, coming\r\nfrom the South, followed the great rivers of the Mississippi Valley.\r\nDuring the summer of 1867 cholera again prevailed, although less\r\nfatally, at most of the points, especially of the Mississippi Valley,\r\nwhich had been invaded the previous year, and some cases occurred at\r\nthe military posts around New York in recruits who had shortly before\r\narrived from places in the West where cholera prevailed. Thus did the\r\ndisease complete the circuit of the United States.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, cholera prevailed to a greater or less extent in the east\r\nof Europe between 1865 and 1874. After the latter date it seems to\r\nhave been confined to Syria, Arabia, and the African shore of the\r\nMediterranean. In 1877-78 it existed to a limited extent among the\r\npilgrims at Mecca, and since then it has not been known in Europe. The\r\nlatest appearance of cholera in the United States was in 1873, when it\r\noccurred at three points far distant from one another. It was\r\nintroduced in the effects of immigrants. The vessels that brought them\r\nwere in a perfect sanitary condition. The passengers themselves were\r\nhealthy, and remained so after landing and until they reached the\r\ndistant points of Carthage, Ohio, Crow River, Minn., and Yankton,\r\nDak., where their goods were unpacked. At each place, \"within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the poison particles were liberated, the first\r\ncases of the disease appeared, and the unfortunates were almost\r\nliterally swept from the face of the earth\" (E. McClellan).\r\n\r\n{719} In 1881 cholera was brought from Hindostan to Arabia by pilgrims\r\non their way to Mecca, where it soon afterward broke out and caused\r\nthe death of about 8000 persons. In the following year several vessels\r\nfrom Bombay evaded the quarantine and reached Djeddah, the port of\r\nMecca, and the pilgrims on reaching the latter city disseminated the\r\ndisease. The unusually small number of persons who were there at the\r\ntime, and their prompt dispersion before the danger, limited the\r\nmortality, and gradually cases of cholera ceased to appear. In 1882,\r\nthe English at that time carrying on war in Egypt, very rigid sanitary\r\nprecautions against the importation of cholera were enacted and\r\nsuccessfully enforced, but in the following year, the same urgent\r\nnecessity no longer commanding, they were considerably relaxed. At the\r\nend of June, 1883, the cholera made its appearance at Damietta (at one\r\nof the mouths of the Nile), and soon afterward at Rosetta, Port Said,\r\nand Mansourah. During July it spread to various places in direct\r\ncommunication with those named. At Cairo it was peculiarly fatal, and\r\non July 20th it was reported to have caused 600 deaths. For several\r\ndays the daily mortality varied between 500 and 600. The disease\r\nprevailed somewhat in Alexandria during the height of the epidemic,\r\nand near the end of October it was fatal to numerous European\r\nresidents of that city, and some deaths occurred in the British army\r\nof occupation. In all Egypt, during the week ending Aug. 13th, the\r\ntotal mortality is said to have been 5000, but in the following week\r\nit fell to 2000. It is estimated that the epidemic destroyed at least\r\n20,000 lives. The germ of this epidemic has not been accurately\r\ndetermined. Some regard it as a survival of the cholera of the\r\nprevious year--a supposition which is at least plausible and\r\nsufficient; but certain \"sanitarians\" have attributed the outbreak to\r\nthe ordinary causes of disease intensified by the civil war which had\r\nrecently devastated Egypt. It is sufficient here to say that while\r\nsuch causes have in all ages generated typhus and typhoid fevers and\r\ndysentery, they never produced cholera. Some, more unwise than\r\njudicious, declared that the Egyptian disease of 1883 was not cholera.\r\nIt is alleged, on the one hand, that several East Indian merchants\r\nfrom Bombay arrived at Damietta on June 18th, or three days before the\r\ndisease was recognized in that city. It is also said that a stoker\r\nfrom on board an English steamer from Bombay introduced the cholera\r\ninto Damietta. But the judgment of Surgeon-General Murray carries with\r\nit greater weight.[3] He is of the opinion that the Egyptian epidemic\r\nof 1883 was simply a revival of the Arabian epidemic of 1882. He shows\r\nthat cholera existed in several villages on the Damietta branch of the\r\nNile in the latter part of May and during June, and that it broke out\r\nin the capital itself, during a fair which had lasted for eight days,\r\non the 22d of June, and was spread by the people on their return from\r\nDamietta to their villages. This, adds Mr. Murray, \"is a literal\r\ntranscript of the accounts of many of the severe epidemics that have\r\nraged over India.\" It also appears from M. Proust's narrative[4] that\r\nthe Ottoman government had already, as early as April, notified the\r\ngovernment of Egypt that certain Indo-Javanese pilgrims were on their\r\nway to Mecca, and that ought not to be allowed to land without\r\nquarantine. The French delegate to the sanitary council also begged\r\nthat those of the pilgrims who reached Suez without previous\r\nquarantine should be isolated and kept under {720} surveillance for\r\nthree days. But owing to the opposition of the English delegates these\r\nmeasures were not duly enforced, the council did not meet again, and\r\nno protective system was adopted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Times and Gazette_, Feb., 1884, p. 209.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Le Cholera_, 1883.]\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The essential cause of cholera is unknown, unless the\r\ninvestigations of Koch, described below, may have revealed it. Its\r\nsecondary causes, or the conditions of its dissemination, are better\r\nunderstood. Some general propositions concerning them will here be\r\nlaid down, and illustrated so far as the argument requires and the\r\navailable space will allow.\r\n\r\nCholera is endemic in no other country than India, and more\r\nparticularly in Bengal. When it has occurred elsewhere it has\r\ninvariably been carried from India. The cholera poison has been\r\nimagined to be of an aërial nature, but its diffusion has no relation\r\nwhatever to the velocity or the direction of the wind. In no instance\r\nwhatever has its rate of progress exceeded that of man on land or\r\nwater, nor has it ever taken a direction different from that of\r\ncommercial or military movements. On land it has usually crept from\r\nplace to place, and if sometimes it has seemed to leap across wide\r\nspaces, and even seas and oceans, it has never invaded any inland town\r\nor seaport without having been brought thither from a point already\r\naffected with the disease. Nor, having once entered an inland or\r\nseaboard town, does it spread equally therein in all directions, but\r\nprevails chiefly in the quarter immediately surrounding the place of\r\nits entrance. If appropriate sanitary measures are enforced, it is\r\nsometimes confined to that quarter, and, in the case of quarantine\r\nstations, it has repeatedly been prevented from extending beyond them.\r\nThis statement may be illustrated by the fact that of fourteen\r\nepidemics of cholera at Staten Island, the quarantine station of New\r\nYork, all but four were prevented from reaching that city.[5] When the\r\ndisease does overleap the barrier opposed to it, its origin and\r\nsubsequent course can usually be traced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Peters's _Notes, etc._, 2d ed., p. 94.]\r\n\r\nA high atmospheric temperature is everywhere associated with the\r\nprevalence of cholera. Its origin in the hot climate of Hindostan and\r\nits general progress prove this conclusively. In nearly all of the\r\nplaces where a great difference exists between the summer and the\r\nwinter temperature the disease has disappeared during the cold season,\r\nand attained its greatest intensity during the hot months of the year.\r\nThe only apparent exception to this rule is, that cholera has\r\nprevailed in several Russian, Swedish, and Norwegian cities during the\r\nwinter. But these very exceptions confirm the rule; for in the\r\ncountries mentioned the intense cold of the winter compels the\r\ninhabitants to seal their houses by every possible means, while the\r\natmosphere within them is kept at a high temperature by huge stoves,\r\nwhich hinder ventilation, and indeed render it almost impossible.\r\nDifference of temperature likewise explains the fact that of two\r\ncholera-ships arriving from Havre, the one at New York and the other\r\nat New Orleans, in December, 1848, the former did not disseminate the\r\ndisease, but the latter formed the starting-point of an epidemic which\r\nlasted all the winter.\r\n\r\nA good deal has been written of the predisposing causes of cholera,\r\nand poverty, crowding, filth, intemperance, and depression of spirits\r\nhave been given prominent places in the catalogue. But to any one\r\nfamiliar {721} with the history of epidemic diseases it will at once\r\nbe apparent that every one of these conditions favors the spread of\r\nall communicable infectious diseases. There is not the slightest\r\nevidence that these agencies, singly or combined, can generate cholera\r\nor favor its spread apart from the presence of the specific poison of\r\nthe disease and the facility with which it is transmitted from the\r\nsick to the well whenever the population is crowded, poor, of filthy\r\nhabits, and weakened by dissipation. Because among such people\r\nintemperance prevails, this vice has been regarded as predisposing to\r\ncholera. Apart from the brutish mode of living of drunkards, there is\r\nnothing to show that they are more liable to cholera than the most\r\nabstemious of water-drinkers. On the contrary, it is notorious that\r\nduring cholera epidemics drunkards in the better classes of society\r\nenjoy a certain degree of immunity from the disease; which it is easy\r\nto explain on the ground that they imbibe but little water, which is\r\nthe main channel through which the infectious principle of the disease\r\nis spread.\r\n\r\nThe specific cause of cholera is taken into the alimentary canal, and\r\nacts through it to produce the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\r\nIt is conveyed from the sick to the well by means of the\r\ngastro-intestinal discharges, either moist or dry; in the former\r\nstate, by means of drinking-water, and in the latter through the air,\r\nwhose suspended noxious particles are received into the fauces and\r\nswallowed. There is reason to believe that the poison does not enter\r\nthe system through the lungs, or through any other channel than the\r\ngastro-intestinal canal. W. B. Carpenter[6] appears to hold, however,\r\nthat the poison may be absorbed through the lungs. To this view there\r\nare two objections: 1, That whatever is taken into the mouth or throat\r\nby inspiration may very well be swallowed; and, 2, that all the\r\nprimary lesions of cholera affect the digestive and not the\r\nrespiratory apparatus. It is not at all necessary to the propagation\r\nof cholera that its excreta should be furnished by persons laboring\r\nunder the fully-formed disease. A specific choleraic diarrhoea is as\r\ninfectious as the evacuations which occur in completely developed\r\ncholera. But neither will propagate the disease through the air to a\r\ndistance. The tendency to its propagation in this manner depends\r\nchiefly upon the concentration of the poison; thus, it much more\r\nfrequently occurs in close than in well-ventilated rooms or than in\r\nthe open air. It has been argued that cholera is not contagious,\r\nbecause so few, comparatively, of the attendants upon cholera patients\r\ncontract the disease. On the other hand, as some of them are attacked,\r\nthis positive fact outweighs an indefinite number of negative\r\ninstances. It should also be noted that different diseases enter the\r\nsystem and infect it through different channels--some through the\r\nlungs, others through the alimentary canal, etc. Small-pox, the most\r\ncontagious of all diseases, is introduced through the air-passages,\r\nand is probably harmless when its virus is taken into the stomach.\r\nThat the converse of this proposition applies to cholera is sustained\r\nby the whole history of the disease. Cholera poison may be taken to\r\nconsiderable distances in either a moist or a dry condition. In the\r\nformer state it is mainly conveyed by water, as in rivers,\r\nwater-pipes, etc.; in the latter, by fomites and especially by\r\nclothing saturated or merely soiled with cholera discharges, and which\r\nmay retain their infectious quality for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _The Nineteenth Century_, Feb., 1884.]\r\n\r\n{722} Great stress has been laid upon the humidity and foulness of the\r\nsoil, a damp atmosphere, filth, crowding, etc., as elements in the\r\nproduction of cholera, but in reality they have no more essential\r\nrelation to it than to any other disease that occurs epidemically.\r\nCholera may prevail whether they are present or absent. It is evident\r\nthat from the earliest historical periods all of these causes of\r\ndisease have existed, and in Europe much more generally and\r\nexcessively than during the present century, and that they have never\r\nbeen removed in Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia, and Africa. Yet cholera\r\nnever was known in any of these countries until it was brought into\r\nthem about the end of the first third of the present century.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pettenkoffer, cholera is most prevalent when the subsoil\r\nwater is lowest, and least so when the subsoil water is highest. It\r\nwould be more descriptive of the fact to say that, so far as cholera\r\nhas anything to do with the condition of the soil, it is most apt to\r\nbe severe and prevalent when very dry weather follows a very wet\r\nperiod. Such circumstances are the most favorable to putrefactive\r\nfermentation and the dissemination of its products, which thus reach\r\nwells of drinking-water, and even rivers, especially when sewers empty\r\ninto the latter. The identity of this explanation with that which is\r\ngenerally accepted for the dissemination of typhoid fever is too\r\nevident to be insisted upon. We might go farther, and say that, in\r\ntyphoid fever as in cholera, the disease is communicated, although\r\nexceptionally, by the air of the sick room and by the exhalations of\r\nthe soiled fomites of the patient. Now, if typhoid fever resembled\r\ncholera not only in being transmitted by means of the dejections, but\r\nalso in its poison being derived from one primary source only, the\r\nanalogy between the causes of the two diseases would be very striking\r\nindeed. But, in point of fact, the typhoid-fever poison may probably\r\nbe generated de novo by fecal fermentation and other forms of\r\nputrefaction, and the disease is only exceptionally communicable;\r\nwhereas, the poison of cholera, once received, is conveyed from man to\r\nman and far and wide through various channels; but, so far as is\r\nknown, it has but one primary source, and that is in India. Lebert\r\nstates that he did not find the localities that are the ordinary seats\r\nof typhoid fever peculiarly liable to invasions of cholera. But it\r\nmust be noted that typhoid fever is very far from being exclusively a\r\ndisease of the poor, squalid, and vicious. Like death itself, \"regum\r\nturres pauperumque tabernas æquo pede pulsat;\" while cholera much more\r\ncommonly plants itself and disseminates its seeds in the rank soil of\r\nmoral and physical degradation.\r\n\r\nAll morbid causes whatever, derived from race, climate, religion,\r\ndwellings, food, clothing, habits of living, etc., have no more to do\r\nwith the development of cholera than with that of the eruptive fevers,\r\nand even less than with the causation of typhus and typhoid fevers and\r\ndysentery. The eruptive fevers are caused, as cholera probably is, by\r\nspecific germs which no known combination of natural causes has ever\r\ndeveloped, while the poisons of the other diseases named appear to be\r\ngenerated anew whenever certain more or less definite physicial\r\nconditions coexist. It would seem that cholera differs radically from\r\nall of these affections by the fact that its cause does not enter the\r\ncirculation, but confines its direct operation to the\r\ngastro-intestinal mucous membrane. In this way it becomes intelligible\r\nthat while, on the one hand, physicians and nurses of {723} cholera\r\npatients, although often, in fact, yet in relation to their numbers,\r\nare comparatively seldom infected, provided they duly observe proper\r\nsanitary rules, the disease, on the other hand, spreads like wildfire\r\namong those who drink water polluted by cholera excretions, and only a\r\nlittle less rapidly among people crowded into ill-ventilated\r\napartments along with cholera patients.\r\n\r\nThe special fomites of the cholera poison are articles of clothing and\r\nfurniture soiled with the discharges of the sick, and the emanations\r\nfrom privies, sewers, etc. into which these discharges have been cast.\r\nMany considerations render it probable that a very small quantity of\r\ncholera matter may suffice to render infectious a very large quantity\r\nof liquid, and especially of matters in process of putrefactive\r\nfermentation, and that the gaseous or vaporous emanations from them\r\nbecome diffused in the atmosphere and infect all who imbibe them. But\r\nwater contaminated by cholera discharges is the most rapid and\r\nefficient agent in disseminating the disease. Innumerable instances of\r\nthis mode of action are furnished by its history in Asia and Africa,\r\nwhere water is often scarce, and naturally so impure that its\r\nadditional defilement by cholera dejections is apt to pass unnoticed.\r\nFrom the illustrations of this proposition which might be adduced only\r\na few of the more striking will here be selected.\r\n\r\nHurdwâr is a town in Northern India at the base of the Himalayas,\r\nwhere the Ganges begins its course in the plains. It is the seat of a\r\ngreat Hindoo pilgrimage, which takes place annually in April, when\r\nsometimes from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 of people occupy an encampment\r\nof about twenty-two square miles, comprising a low flat island in the\r\nGanges and the opposite banks of the river. Bathing in the sacred\r\nstream on a certain day is the main object of the devotees; which day,\r\nin the year 1867, fell on the 12th of April. The bath was taken early\r\nin the morning. From noon on that day the pilgrims began to disperse\r\nso rapidly that on the morning of the 15th the encampment was quite\r\ndeserted. It appears that up to the former date the health of the\r\nencampment was excellent, and it was the opinion of the reporter (Dr.\r\nCunningham) that cholera was introduced into the camp by pilgrims from\r\nthe neighboring districts going late to the fair. He believed that the\r\ncholera excreta may have been buried in the trenches and carried by a\r\nheavy rain into the river, and there swallowed by the pilgrims; for to\r\ndrink of the water of the Ganges as well as to bathe in it is a\r\nreligious obligation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the breaking up of the camp cases occurred in the\r\nsurrounding districts, the epidemic widening in all directions. The\r\npilgrims were almost always the first persons attacked in any\r\nlocality, and the cholera attended them on their route wherever they\r\nwent. In all the districts where the disease prevailed no cases\r\noccurred until ample time had been given for the pilgrims to reach\r\nthem. In a word, \"the cholera first showed itself among them; it\r\nfollowed their lines of route only, and did not outrun them; their\r\nprogress was its progress, and their limits its limits.\" The mortality\r\ncaused by this epidemic among the whole civil population of the\r\nNorth-western Provinces of the Punjâb has been estimated at about\r\n117,181.[7] The history of the religious festival of 1879 {724} was\r\nidentical with that just sketched, except that the number of the\r\npilgrims was smaller and the deaths proportionally less.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Brit. and For. Med. Chir. Rev._, Jan., 1870, p. 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Murray, _Practitioner_, xxvi. 309.]\r\n\r\nOut of the numberless illustrations of the manner in which cholera is\r\ndisseminated by water the following may be cited: In 1865 about\r\n100,000 pilgrims were assembled at Mecca, of whom from 10,000 to\r\n15,000 fell victims to the disease, two-thirds of them within a period\r\nof six days. Some cause acting simultaneously upon the whole number of\r\npersons must be admitted to account for so extraordinary a fact, and\r\nsuch a cause is not far to seek. At a certain sacred well \"one hundred\r\nthousand people had skinfuls of water poured over them at the side of\r\nthe well, and every one of them then drank largely of water drawn from\r\nthe well. Much of the water poured over the pilgrims must have found\r\nits way by soakage back into the well, and if any of the pilgrims were\r\nat the time suffering from cholera, or had cholera-tainted garments\r\nabout them, the well would be exposed to pollution.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Christie, _Cholera Epidemics in East Africa_, p. 488.]\r\n\r\nIn the cholera epidemics of Zanzibar the disease produced the greatest\r\nhavoc among the negroes, the Persians, and the East Indians; very few\r\nEuropeans were attacked, and quite as few of the sect of the Banyans,\r\nwho drank only water drawn from their own wells. The persons among\r\nwhom the disease prevailed so fatally used chiefly the water of a\r\ncertain well which was highly prized, but which on this occasion had\r\nbecome polluted by soakage from an adjacent cesspool into which the\r\ndejections of cholera patients had been thrown. It appears, also, that\r\nin Zanzibar the streams are very rarely bridged, and hundreds of\r\nnegroes, in passing backward and forward, wade through them and\r\npollute them. In these streams, also, the negroes wash their clothes\r\nand all the foul clothing of the contiguous town. While this business\r\nis going on \"a gang of negroes may be at work at not many hundred\r\nyards' distance filling water-casks for the shipping.\" Subsequently to\r\nthe watering of the ships in this manner sailors were attacked with\r\ncholera, and others who used water drawn from the stream below the\r\nplace where it became polluted were attacked, and many of them died;\r\nwhile Europeans living on shore, and who drank the water of the same\r\nstream, but drawn from a much higher point in its course and after\r\nhaving been filtered, escaped the disease.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Ibid._, pp. 320, 492.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the disease in Europe furnishes a multiplicity of\r\nsimilar cases, and even more distinctly exhibits the dissemination of\r\ncholera by contaminated water.[11] In Holland not less than five\r\nepidemics of the disease occurred between 1832 and 1869, all of them\r\ncausing a great mortality, to which the epidemic of 1866 alone\r\ncontributed not less than 20,000 deaths. This was about 55 deaths for\r\nevery 10,000 inhabitants. Such exceptional mortality over so wide a\r\nterritory has been ascribed to the extreme porosity and humidity of\r\nthe soil, which is nearly all below the level of the sea. Such a soil\r\nmust necessarily retain longer than other soils whatever it absorbs,\r\nand thus tend to render the well-water habitually impure. If, then, to\r\nthe ordinary impurities a specific {725} poison is added, its\r\ncharacteristic effects may assuredly be looked for. The conditions now\r\nstated explain the conclusions of Ballot of Rotterdam, drawn from a\r\nstudy of the several epidemics referred to. They are as follows: \"1.\r\nHolland is highly affected by the cholera at every epidemic, chiefly\r\nin those parts where they drink water directly from the rivers and\r\ncanals or from ground saturated with sewage. 2. In places where\r\nrain-water is generally drunk the disease is far less violent. 3.\r\nPlaces where there is no other drinkable water but rain-water are not\r\naffected by the epidemic; the single cases occurring there are\r\nimported. 4. When places affected by the cholera were supplied with\r\npure water instead of the vitiated water the disease disappeared.\"[12]\r\nIn like manner, we find that the cholera epidemic of 1873 in Germany\r\nseemed specially to select those situations where the subsoil was\r\nimpregnated with decomposing organic matter; and it is evident that,\r\nin cities especially, such situations would include the most\r\npoverty-stricken districts, while the higher, drier, and at all times\r\nmore salubrious localities are inhabited by the classes enjoying the\r\ngreatest material prosperity.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: It is of interest to note that on the first appearance\r\nof cholera in England, at Sunderland, in 1831, a surgeon of that\r\nplace, Mr. Ainsworth, collected and published conclusive proofs of the\r\nimportation of the disease, of its communication from the sick to the\r\nwell, \"and of its propagation by clothes, and even by emanations, from\r\nthe dead\" (_Observations on the Pestilential Cholera_, London, 1832).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Med. Times and Gaz._, May, 1869, p. 459; June, 1869, p.\r\n626.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: \"Report of the German Imperial Commission,\"\r\n_Practitioner_, xxvi. 153.]\r\n\r\nThis mode of infection has been traced in numberless individual cases\r\nof cholera. In London there was a certain well into which the liquid\r\ncontents of a sewer had been percolating for months. Of the water of\r\nthis well hundreds of persons had been drinking without obvious\r\ninjury. At last a case of cholera occurred hard by; the discharges\r\nwere thrown into a privy which communicated with the sewer and\r\nindirectly with the well, whereupon more than 500 persons who drank\r\nwater drawn from that particular well were attacked with cholera\r\nwithin three days. So in 1856 cholera prevailed in the county jail of\r\nOxford, Eng., the drain from which emptied into a pool from which the\r\nwater was drawn to supply the city prison. In the latter institution\r\ncholera began to prevail, but declined as soon as the pipes conveying\r\nthe water were cut off, and soon afterward ceased entirely.[14] Again,\r\nin Constantinople in 1865 the clothes, mattrasses, etc. of cholera\r\npatients were washed at a fountain the basin of which was divided into\r\ntwo parts by a wall; one part was used for washing clothes and the\r\nother for drinking purposes. Unfortunately, the waste-pipe of the\r\nformer being obstructed, the foul water of one side communicated with\r\nthe clean water of the other, and in one day 60 people died of cholera\r\nin the small portion of the city which was supplied from the infected\r\nsource. The striking case has often been cited which occurred at\r\nEpping, Eng., where a woman brought the disease from a distance into a\r\nperfectly healthy house and neighborhood, and of ten persons affected\r\nwith it seven died, including a physician in attendance upon one of\r\nthem. An examination of the premises \"discovered, below the pipes\r\nleading from the water-closet and from the eye-hole of the sink\r\nthrough which the choleraic dejections had been passed, a leakage\r\nwhich extended under the foundations of the building and entered the\r\nwell. The sewage was distinctly traceable on the side of the well\r\ncorresponding with the leakage in the drain.\" After this discovery and\r\nthe disuse of the foul water not another case occurred.[15] In 1868,\r\nDr. {726} Farr, in his _History of the London Cholera Epidemic of\r\n1866_, showed that water into which cholera dejections find their way\r\nproduces cases of cholera all over the district in which it is\r\ndistributed for a certain period of time, and that if the distribution\r\nis in any way cut short the deaths from cholera begin to decline\r\nwithin about three days of the date at which the distribution is\r\nstopped.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Edinb. Med. Jour._, i. 1122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Trans. of the Epidemiological Soc._, ii. 428.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Lancet_, April, 1868, p. 217.]\r\n\r\nAnalogous instances are furnished by every cholera epidemic of which\r\nthe history has been accurately observed, including that which\r\nextended so widely over the United States in 1873. Most of the\r\nfollowing are cited from the official reports prepared, under the\r\ndirection of the Surgeon-General of the army, by Surgeon Ely McClellan\r\nand Dr. John C. Peters. Several of the first cases, however, are\r\nforeign.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, at a station in India, some fresh cholera dejecta found their\r\nway into a vessel of drinking-water. Early on the following morning a\r\nsmall quantity of this water was swallowed by nineteen persons, five\r\nof whom were attacked with cholera between the first and the third day\r\nafterward.[17] In 1876 an outbreak of cholera took place in a village\r\nin Hindostan, which followed the arrival of wedding-guests, one of\r\nwhom was attacked, and from whom it rapidly spread. The soiled clothes\r\nof one or more of the patients were washed in a pool from which all\r\nthe villagers obtained their drinking-water, and on the discontinuance\r\nof this source of water-supply cholera speedily diminished in\r\nfrequency and fatality.[18] In the German epidemic of 1873 many cases\r\noccurred where persons deriving their drinking-water from special\r\nsources were attacked with cholera, while their neighbors, supplied\r\nfrom a different source, remained free. Again, it has frequently\r\nhappened that outbreaks of cholera have been checked by the\r\nprohibition of the suspected water and the substitution of a pure\r\nsupply.[19] It seems probable that a very small portion of cholera\r\ndischarges suffices to infect a very large body of water and maintain\r\nits infectiousness for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Macnamara, _op. cit._, p. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Surg.-Major Cornish, _Practitioner_, xxiv. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Practitioner_, xxvi. 159.]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1871, an outburst of cholera occurred which was confined\r\nto the inmates of three excellent houses in a fine block of buildings\r\nin Calcutta. There had been no cholera in that neighborhood for four\r\nyears. Within forty-eight hours a majority of the lodgers were sick,\r\nand on investigation it was found that the disease was carried in the\r\ndrinking-water and in the milk diluted with it.[20] The particular\r\nlocality in which Dr. Koch made the discovery of the microscopic\r\nrepresentative of cholera furnishes an example of the same nature: \"At\r\nSaheb Ragau, a locality which has repeatedly been visited by cholera\r\nduring the last hundred years, numerous cases of the disease were\r\nreported, and these, on inquiry, were found exclusively in the huts\r\nsituated round a certain tank. Of the few hundred people who dwelt in\r\nthese huts, as many as seventeen died of cholera, though the disease\r\nwas not at that time prevalent in the neighborhood, or indeed in the\r\nwhole police district of Calcutta. It was proved that, as usual in\r\nsuch cases, the dwellers around the tank used it for bathing, and drew\r\nthence their drinking-water; it was also elicited that the linen of\r\nthe first fatal case, befouled with cholera dejections, had been\r\nwashed in the tank.\"[21] In June, 1873, a new {727} hotel was opened\r\nat Vienna, and many of the guests became affected with diarrhoea that\r\nwas attributed to the drinking-water, which was offensive to the taste\r\nand smell. After a fortnight a gentleman died of cholera in the hotel,\r\nand two days later several of the guests were attacked with the\r\ndisease, of whom fourteen died. The gentleman who first died was\r\nbelieved to have brought the poison with him into the hotel, so that\r\nthe drinking-water, which previously had been polluted with ordinary\r\nfecal discharges, became specifically affected through him.[22] The\r\ndischarges of one ill of cholera were thrown into, and the vessels\r\nused by him were washed near, a well from which all the residents of a\r\nfarm-house drank. The wooden curbing of the well had rotted, and the\r\nground immediately around had sunken; a heavy rain burst the curb,\r\noverflowed the well, and washed into it the entire surface-drainage of\r\nthe surrounding ground. No attention was paid to this, and the water\r\nwas used as before. It became so offensive that its use was forbidden,\r\nbut too late to save the family, nine of whom died of cholera.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _U.S. Report_, p. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Times and Gaz._, April, 1884, p. 527.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Times and Gaz._, p. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Ibid._, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nAt Farmington, Tenn., a man arrived who had contracted the cholera at\r\nNashville; his illness ran its course at a point just forty paces from\r\na well. Families that obtained their water from this well suffered in\r\nnearly all their members; where only certain members drank of it, they\r\nalone were affected.[24] At Huntsville, Ala., during an epidemic of\r\ncholera, the city authorities forbade the use of well-water, and\r\nsupplied pure water from another source, but only for one week. During\r\nthis time no new cases of the disease occurred, and the negroes,\r\nthinking themselves secure, resumed the use of the well-water, and\r\nwithin four days six fatal cases of cholera occurred in the vicinity.\r\nThe use of the well-water was again prohibited, and again the progress\r\nof the disease was arrested.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Ibid._, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Ibid._, p. 408. For other examples of the spread of\r\ncholera by means of drinking-water see Macnamara, p. 149 and seq.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been intimated that the cholera poison may be diffused\r\nthrough the air from either moist or dry sources, and especially from\r\ncontaminated clothing, and then be taken into the throat and\r\nswallowed. Dr. Richardson refers to a local epidemic in England in\r\nwhich \"the persons most constantly and fatally attacked were the women\r\nwho washed the clothes of the sick;\" and this circumstance has been\r\nlargely confirmed by other observers.[26] In a village not far from\r\nMarseilles, and in an isolated place, a peasant and his wife who had\r\nnot left the country sickened and died of the disease. The woman, who\r\nwas a laundress, had received a bundle of linen belonging to a person\r\nrecently arrived from Egypt, and the husband opened the bundle and\r\nunfolded the pieces. During the Crimean War many of the washermen\r\nattending to the washing of the French hospitals were attacked by\r\ncholera. In the post-office at Marseilles none of the clerks who\r\nhandled the outgoing mails were attacked, but of those who sorted the\r\nmails coming from the East, where the disease prevailed, one after\r\nanother suffered from cholera.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Trans. Epidem. Soc._, ii. 429.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Read, Boston, 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe cholera was introduced into Guadaloupe by clothing contained in a\r\ntrunk belonging to a person who died on the voyage thither from\r\nMarseilles, where the cholera then prevailed. The woman who washed the\r\nclothing died, with all her family. Attracted by the circumstances of\r\n{728} the case, many came to her house, and of these several died.\r\nFrom this point the disease spread over the island.[28] A sailor died\r\nat some port in Europe of Asiatic cholera in 1832. A chest containing\r\nhis personal effects, clothing, etc. was sent home to his family, who\r\nlived in a small straggling village on the Atlantic coast of the State\r\nof Maine. It reached them about Christmas, and was opened on its\r\narrival. The inmates of the house were all immediately and suddenly\r\nseized with a disease resembling Asiatic cholera in all its malignity,\r\nand died. There had been no cholera in the State. The last case of\r\ncholera that occurred in the garrison at Malta in the epidemic of 1865\r\nwas that of a woman who had stolen a chemise the property of one who\r\nhad died of the disease. She put on this fatal garment, probably\r\nsoiled with cholera discharges, and certainly unwashed, many days\r\nafter the death of its former possessor; she took the disease and\r\ndied.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Med. Times and Gaz._, April, 1874, p. 387.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Lancet_, Feb. 17, 1866.]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said, and oftentimes repeated, that cholera is not\r\ndirectly contagious--is not communicated by the sick to the well. No\r\nstatement could be more unfounded. The whole history of cholera proves\r\nthat the physicians and nurses of cholera patients are often affected\r\nby the disease. \"In Constantinople no less than twenty-seven\r\nphysicians and medical assistants were attacked and died during their\r\nattendance on cholera patients; and in Paris and Toulon similar\r\nresults followed. At Halifax, N.S., two of the physicians who\r\nvolunteered in aid of the steamer England, which put in there disabled\r\nby the ravages of cholera among the officers and crew, as well as\r\namong the steerage passengers, took the disease, and one died\" (Read).\r\nIn 1832 the cases of cholera in Edinburgh were in the proportion of 1\r\nto every 1200 of the population of the city, while among those in\r\nattendance upon the sick the proportion was 1 to 5. In 1848-49\r\none-fourth of the nurses employed in the cholera hospital took the\r\ndisease, while in the general hospital, only a few paces distant,\r\nwhere no cholera patients were received, not a single attendant was\r\nattacked. In the London Hospital, in 1866, none of the medical\r\nofficers, volunteer nurses, or sisters were attacked. Of the (regular)\r\nnurses five contracted the disease, and of these four died.[30] In\r\n1849 a severe and fatal epidemic broke out in the Philadelphia\r\nAlmshouse. The resident physicians of the hospital were abundantly\r\noccupied with the care of the sick of other diseases, and it was\r\nthought prudent not to allow any, even an indirect, communication\r\nbetween them and the cholera patients. The latter were therefore\r\nremoved to an isolated building in the middle of the quadrangle, and\r\nattended by physicians from the city who had volunteered their aid.\r\nThree or four of these physicians had attacks of cholera, and two of\r\nthem died.[31] At this time there was no cholera at all in the city,\r\nand the young physicians could not have become infected outside of the\r\nalmshouse. They were attacked while attending the sick of cholera, but\r\nthe regular house-physicians, who seldom visited the cholera patients,\r\nescaped altogether.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _London Hosp. Rep._, iii. 439.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Philada. Med. Examiner_, Nov., 1849.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of recognizing the communicability of cholera is so\r\ngreat that no apology need be made for introducing the following\r\nadditional illustrations of it furnished by Griesinger in his article\r\non the dangers of cholera to medical men. They are the more important\r\nbecause {729} in many other instances cholera physicians have suffered\r\nlittle for their devotion to duty: \"At Moscow, in 1840, hospital\r\nattendants contracted the disease to the extent of 30 or 40 per cent.,\r\nwhile in the general population only 3 per cent. were attacked; at\r\nBerlin, in 1831, in Romberg's hospital, 54 out of 115 persons were\r\nattacked: in 1837 one-fifth of the attendants took the disease, and on\r\none occasion no less than seven of them fell ill on a single day. In\r\nLa Charité Hospital in Paris, in 1849, one-sixth of the attendants had\r\nthe disease, while only one-twenty-fifth of the general population of\r\nthe city suffered from it; at Mittau, in 1848, one-half of the\r\nphysicians took the disease; in 1842, at Toulon, ten health officers\r\nout of thirty-five were ill with cholera, and five of them died, while\r\nof thirty workmen who were employed to carry the dead bodies one-third\r\nsuccumbed; at Stockholm, in 1853, of 536 attendants one-eighth took\r\nthe disease, and half of that number died; at Vienna, in 1854, out of\r\nthirty-six nurses, seven caught the disease, and seven men employed in\r\nremoving the dead became affected with a prolonged and exhausting\r\ndiarrhoea; in 1849, at Strasburg, five nurses out of ten were\r\nattacked, etc.\" ... \"Physicians, nurses, students, etc. are less\r\nfrequently affected, however, than patients ill with other diseases\r\nwho are lying in the wards where cholera patients are treated, and are\r\ntherefore more constantly exposed to the emanations from the\r\ndischarges; and physicians usually suffer less than the attendants who\r\nare constantly waiting on the cholera patients.\"[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Traité des Maladies infectieuses_, 1868, p. 409.]\r\n\r\nIt may be added that Surgeon-General John Murray, who served\r\ncontinuously for thirty-eight years in British India, caused upward of\r\nfive hundred circulars to be addressed to the local governments and\r\nfilled up by the local medical officers. From these returns it\r\nappeared that the belief in the communicability of cholera, in one way\r\nor another, was practically unanimous; for of the whole number, those\r\nwho believed that it is conveyed from person to person were 75 per\r\ncent.; from place to place, 85 per cent.; through the atmosphere, 80\r\nper cent.; with the drinking-water, 85 per cent.; by the evacuations,\r\n92 per cent.; and by clothing, 98 per cent.[33] This gentleman has\r\nmore recently furnished additional facts supporting the same\r\nconclusion. For example: Out of fourteen cases that occurred at Ramleh\r\nduring the Egyptian epidemic, eleven occurred in patients already in\r\nthe hospital for other diseases. In 1856, after visiting the\r\ndead-house where the bodies of fourteen cholera patients lay, as he\r\nentered the cholera ward he felt a sudden shock in the epigastrium,\r\nfollowed by a deadening sensation that rapidly spread over the whole\r\nbody. On another occasion he saw a clergyman who was talking to a\r\ncholera patient suddenly seized with vomiting of a watery liquid.\r\nSeveral analogous instances are related by him.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Practitioner_, xix. 470.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Med. Times and Gaz._, March, 1884, p. 281.]\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the communicability of cholera that its\r\ndissemination does not always follow the deposit of cholera discharges\r\nin privies, wells, etc., and also that when infection does take place,\r\nit may occur between remote extremes as to time, and therefore cannot\r\nbe attributed to infectious germs. Such objections are frivolous,\r\nbecause we know nothing of the nature or vitality of cholera-germs,\r\nand they are, moreover, drawn from exceptional cases. The power of\r\ninfected fomites to develop {730} the disease has been preserved, in a\r\njourney from Arabia into Africa, for at least twelve days, and for\r\neven a longer period in passing from Germany to Chicago, as already\r\nrelated. It is true of every infectious and contagious disease that it\r\nmay possess one or both of these qualities in various degrees--that at\r\none time it is only exceptionally communicated, and that at another\r\ntime it appears to propagate itself virulently. So the phenomena of\r\ncholera may consist of little more than a watery diarrhoea, which may\r\nbe so mild as hardly to disable the patient from working, while at\r\nother times the attack may include all those terrible and fatal\r\nsymptoms which have won for the disease the name of malignant. That a\r\ncertain quantity, or \"dose,\" of the cholera poison is required to\r\ndevelop the disease, but one that varies considerably in different\r\ncases, may be inferred from these facts: 1. Out of a certain number of\r\npersons equally exposed to receive the disease, only a portion may be\r\nattacked at all, and these in very unequal degrees. 2. Persons so\r\nslightly affected as to be ignorant of the nature of their sickness,\r\nand believing it to be an ordinary diarrhoea, may nevertheless become\r\nthe innocent, because ignorant, disseminators of cholera. The\r\nexplanation of such facts may be manifold: they may depend upon the\r\ndose or upon the energy of the morbid poison, on various possible\r\nconditions of its recipient, and so on; but, however explained, their\r\nreality is none the less certain. The receptivity of persons exposed\r\nto the contagion of cholera is very different. It is well known that\r\nsome persons appear to be proof against other contagious diseases,\r\nwhile others seem never to acquire an immunity from them. On this very\r\nimportant point the conclusions of Fauvel directly bear.[35] They\r\ninclude the following propositions: The East Indian ports where\r\ncholera exists as an endemic disease are never the seat of an\r\nextensive epidemic among the native population. But strangers to these\r\nlocalities are liable to the disease, and such are the Mussulman\r\npilgrims who come to Bombay to take ship for Mecca. A severe epidemic\r\nof cholera confers upon the locality in which it has taken place an\r\nimmunity which in India appears to be of several years' duration. Such\r\nan epidemic in any country is a proof that the cholera is not endemic\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Mémoire lu à l'Académie des Sciences_, 1883.]\r\n\r\nIf a contagious disease preserved its virulence undiminished, it might\r\ncontinue to prevail indefinitely. But we know that all other\r\ncontagious epidemics do come to an end sooner or later, and hence we\r\nmust conclude that their specific cause progressively loses its\r\nvirulent qualities. There is every reason, therefore, to believe that\r\nthe same is true of cholera. Its communicability, and therefore its\r\ndiffusion, may vary with climatic, seasonal, local, personal, and\r\nother conditions; but of what nature those conditions are, and\r\nespecially of the last and most important, the personal, hardly\r\nanything is known. Nor need we too curiously investigate them, so long\r\nas the fact remains that outside of, and independent of them all,\r\nthere is but one essential cause of cholera--a morbid poison as\r\nspecific in its nature as that of any of the eruptive fevers--a poison\r\nwhich no determinable conjunction of circumstances has ever\r\nengendered, and which was unknown in Europe and America before it was\r\ncarried to them from India. In just such a way did small-pox first\r\narise in the Western World. It had never appeared in Europe until the\r\nlatter part of the {731} sixth century, when for a short time it\r\nprevailed in Marseilles and the neighboring country. Afterward it was\r\nnot heard of until it was reintroduced by the Crusaders on their\r\nreturn from Palestine in the twelfth century, since which period it\r\nhas hardly ever ceased. The history of the diffusion of cholera is\r\nclosely analogous to this in several particulars, and we may\r\nreasonably expect that what was in the last generation a new disease\r\nwill henceforth be liable to prevail again and again as the\r\nintercourse increases between the nations of the West and the\r\nimmemorial source of cholera in Hindostan.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Additional illustrations of the communicability of\r\ncholera are contained in the _Brit. and For. Med. Chir. Rev._, July,\r\n1872, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding discussion of the origin and dissemination of cholera\r\nthe broad facts of its specific nature and its contagion by means of\r\nexcreta have been chiefly insisted upon. Little has been said either\r\nof the nature of the contagium or of the conditions that modify its\r\nactivity. These points will be considered hereafter. But it is proper\r\nin this place to state that, in the opinion of most investigators, the\r\ncontagious element has the power of multiplying itself, not only\r\nwithin the body, but wherever it is in contact with decomposing\r\norganic matter, provided that the degree of heat and amount of\r\nmoisture present are adapted to promote such a change, which is\r\ncertainly analogous to fermentation, if not identical with it. And the\r\nfacts already mentioned may be recalled, which show that the contagium\r\ncannot be a light and subtle substance, since, as has been stated, the\r\nimmediate attendants upon cholera patients are not as apt as might be\r\nexpected, on that hypothesis, to contract the disease, while\r\nwasherwomen inhaling, and probably swallowing, the moist fumes from\r\ncholera fomites much more frequently do so; that fomites saturated\r\nwith the dried discharges are very infectious; and that water is the\r\nprincipal vehicle by which cholera-germs are carried into the stomach.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Like other diseases, cholera occurs under very\r\ndissimilar aspects and with various degrees of gravity. Like those\r\nespecially which are caused by specific morbid poisons, it may be so\r\ninsignificant as to escape recognition, or, on the other hand, it may\r\ngive rise to violent and distressing symptoms which come on without\r\nwarning and hurry the patient to inevitable death. Whenever epidemic\r\ndiseases present such opposite extremes of severity in their symptoms,\r\nit may reasonably be inferred that the differences depend mainly upon\r\nthe quantity of the poison that has been received into the system,\r\nprecisely as the dose which has been taken of a narcotic or acrid\r\npoison may be estimated by the gravity of its effects. Individual\r\npeculiarities, constitutional or acquired, may modify the\r\ncharacteristic phenomena, and sometimes a careful inquiry may be\r\nnecessary even to detect their existence; but a study of cholera in\r\nall its grades shows that its symptoms are all the effects of one and\r\nthe same cause, and that the cholera poison acts primarily upon the\r\ngastro-intestinal mucous membrane. It follows, as a matter of course,\r\nthat, being thus applied, it will occasion symptoms differing in\r\ndegree and in kind according to the energy of its action, and that\r\nthis, again, will depend partly upon the inherent virulence of the\r\nagent and partly upon its quantity. In fact, this feature in the\r\nclinical history of the disease can be explained only by the operation\r\nof a special irritant acting with different degrees of power upon the\r\ngastro-intestinal {732} mucous membrane. In other words, the different\r\nforms under which it is convenient clinically to recognize and\r\ndescribe cholera are nothing more than different degrees of the\r\noperation of one and the same poison, modified more or less by the\r\npeculiarities of individual patients. In the most typical of the\r\nfully-formed cases of cholera there is a stage of diarrhoea, a stage\r\nof cholera morbus--_i.e._ of vomiting and purging--with more or less\r\nevidence of stagnation of the blood, which is followed either by\r\nreaction and recovery or collapse and death. The phenomena of those\r\nseveral stages will now be described, after which certain symptoms\r\nwill be more particularly considered.\r\n\r\nIt has more than once been pointed out that, however mild an attack of\r\ncholera may be, the dejections accompanying it are infectious, and may\r\nproduce in other persons the gravest types of the disease. Hence the\r\nimportance, not only to the patients, but also to others, of\r\nrecognizing it in the earliest stage; for while this knowledge may\r\nsuggest measures for preventing an extension of the disease, it leads\r\nto the prompt use of remedies at the only period in which their\r\nsuccess can at all be counted upon. The characteristic of this stage,\r\nwhich has generally been called either choleraic diarrhoea or\r\ncholerine, is a diarrhoea remarkable for its profuseness and the\r\nfrequency and serous quality of the stools, which are, however, of a\r\nmore or less yellow color. They are preceded by rumbling and gurgling\r\nnoises in the abdomen, are voided without colic or tenesmus, and are\r\nfollowed by a remarkable sense of exhaustion or faintness, which is\r\nsometimes also accompanied with nausea, and, if they are very frequent\r\nand copious, cramps are apt to be felt in the calves of the legs. In\r\nthis variety or stage of the attack, as a rule, there is not any\r\nvomiting; there is complete anorexia, but urgent thirst, a white and\r\nclammy tongue, and a peculiar alteration of tone, a huskiness,\r\nfaintness, or hoarseness of the voice. The stools vary from six to\r\ntwelve a day, and, as above stated, are slightly yellow; they are also\r\nalkaline, and on standing deposit a granular sediment which consists\r\nlargely of the débris of intestinal epithelium. Unless the attack is\r\nvery severe the temperature is not lowered by much more than 1° F. The\r\nsymptoms now described, especially in their milder grades, may last\r\nfor a week or even longer, and then, according to circumstances, end\r\neither in cure or in fully-developed cholera; but under appropriate\r\ntreatment they usually subside in a day or two, and more or less\r\nrapidly according to the degree of damage done to the digestive mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nBetween the above, which is the mildest type of epidemic cholera, and\r\nthe fully-developed disease must be placed that grade of the disease\r\nwhich is more appropriately called cholerine, comprising cases in\r\nwhich vomiting occurs as well as purging, with increased debility and\r\na tendency, more or less decided, to collapse. The matters vomited,\r\nafter the rejection of undigested food, are at first bilious, but they\r\ngradually become less and less so the longer the attack lasts, and,\r\ntogether with the stools, assume the appearance of rice-water--_i.e._\r\nthey consist of a pale grayish, semi-transparent liquid in which white\r\nflocculi are suspended. Its reaction is alkaline, and it has a faint\r\nalbuminous or spermatic smell. Along with these symptoms the other\r\neffects of serous depletion arise--debility with pallor, duskiness,\r\ncoldness, profuse perspiration, and a sodden condition of the skin,\r\nwhile the secretion of urine is diminished, {733} and all the symptoms\r\nthat belong to the first stage of cholera are present in an aggravated\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of this disease is that sometimes the onset even of\r\nits graver forms is not attended by any evacuations, although the\r\nstomach and intestine may be filled with liquid. It is perhaps chiefly\r\nin such cases that the patient experiences a rapid depression of all\r\nthe mental and physical faculties. The senses are irritable, the head\r\naches and is confused, there is a disinclination to sleep, the limbs\r\ntotter under the weight of the body, the pulse is frequent and feeble,\r\noccasionally fainting takes place; the skin is cool and bedewed with\r\nperspiration. In other cases, again, the attack is sudden; the patient\r\nis smitten with an unaccountable feebleness, speedily followed by\r\nprofuse vomiting and purging and general spasms, and dies without any\r\nsuspension of the symptoms or any tendency to reaction.\r\n\r\nBut more usually the attack begins with the diarrhoea and vomiting\r\ndescribed above, which then assume, more or less rapidly, a high\r\ndegree of violence, expressed by their frequency and excess. The\r\nstools with proportionate rapidity lose all their fecal qualities and\r\nacquire the rice-water appearance before mentioned, and the liquid\r\nrejected by vomiting in all respects resembles them. It is poured\r\nforth less by an ordinary act of vomiting than by gushes, as if it\r\noverflowed from the throat and mouth; and it often escapes from the\r\nstomach and the bowels at the same instant. Such profuse evacuations\r\nnecessarily occasion an urgent thirst which cannot be satisfied, for\r\nliquids are thrown up immediately on being swallowed. Sometimes a\r\ndistressing hiccough accompanies these symptoms. It is indeed only one\r\nof the many spasms which may affect the muscular system. They\r\ngenerally begin in the fingers and toes, which become bent and stiff;\r\nthey seize upon the muscles of the calves of the legs, and render the\r\nmuscular wall of the abdomen as hard as a board. The pain they produce\r\nis extremely severe, and unless the patient is exceedingly prostrated\r\nhe endeavors to assuage it by a constant change of position.\r\n\r\nAt this period the debility is very great, and progressively\r\nincreases, and the patient is unable to rise, or even to move at all\r\nexcept under the stimulus of the painful spasms. The features are\r\nshrunken; the nose is sharp and pallid, and bent to one side; the\r\ndusky, lack-lustre, and sunken eyes, the thin lips, the hollow cheeks,\r\nand the contracted muscles that stand out like cords under the tense\r\nand clammy skin, present a physiognomy that belongs to no other\r\ndisease in the same degree. The hands and feet grow cold, and steadily\r\nthe coldness creeps upward toward the trunk; the temperature falls to\r\n94° or 95° F.; the feeble and even flickering pulse ranges from 100 to\r\n120. The integuments of the limbs are shrivelled and damp, and look as\r\nif they had been macerated in water; and if a fold of the skin is\r\npinched up it subsides very slowly indeed. The eyes grow dull and dry,\r\nthe tongue has a pasty or sticky feel, and the urine is almost\r\nsuppressed. If any of this excretion can be obtained for examination,\r\nit is found to contain both albumen and sugar. As the attack advances\r\nthe patient falls into a dull, listless, and motionless state, which\r\nmay be mistaken for insensibility or even unconsciousness but is\r\nreally due to exhaustion of all the faculties of mind and body. He may\r\nexpress no interest in anything, and hardly notice the {734} attention\r\nor the distress of his friends, yet he will generally give clear,\r\nalthough languid, answers to questions, and fall again into an inert\r\nand unobservant state.\r\n\r\nAs these symptoms continue and the fluids of the body decrease, the\r\nblood accumulates and stagnates in the veins, giving to the hands and\r\nfeet, the nose and lips and other features, to the neck, and even to\r\nthe entire surface of the body, a bluish, leaden, or violet tint,\r\nprecisely like that of cyanotic children. The pulse, that was already\r\nweak and thready, is no longer perceptible; the carotids even and the\r\nimpulse of the heart cease to be felt, and the second sound of the\r\nlatter becomes inaudible. The skin is everywhere cold; the hands,\r\nfeet, and face are sometimes of an icy coldness, and yet the patients\r\nseldom perceive that they are so; indeed, complaint is more apt to be\r\nmade of suffering from internal heat. Even the breath as it issues\r\nfrom the nostrils feels cold. The blood no longer circulates, and the\r\nheart seems still. If a vein is opened a few drops of black and viscid\r\nblood will trickle from the wound, which if it coagulates, yields but\r\nlittle serum, and in place of a firm clot only a diffluent jelly. The\r\nvoice has sunk to a mere whisper or is quite extinct. The features\r\nassume a distorted and frightful expression; the temples and cheeks\r\nare hollowed; the nose is twisted and pointed, and the nostrils are\r\nobstructed with dry and powdery crusts; the eyes are also dry, dull,\r\nand sunken behind the half-closed and purple lids; the conjunctiva is\r\nno longer moistened by its secretion and becomes bloodshot; the\r\ntemperature in the mouth may fall to 79° or 80° F.; a viscid\r\nexhalation bedews the icy and marbled skin; and the whole body is so\r\nshrunken from its natural proportions as to lose all the marks by\r\nwhich its identity has been recognized. From this pulseless,\r\nexhausted, cold, and cyanotic condition there can be but one step to\r\ndeath. It generally comes on gradually, the patient sinking into the\r\nstate of apparent insensibility before mentioned; on the other hand,\r\nhe may expire suddenly on attempting to make some unusual effort.\r\n\r\nAt any period in the progress of cholera, except that of complete\r\nasphyxia, the contest between the system and the disease may be\r\ndecided in favor of the former. If this occurs before profuse\r\nevacuations have taken place or blueness of the skin appeared, the\r\nrecovery may be gradual and present no special phenomena. The pulse\r\nregains by degrees its natural force; the skin grows warm again, first\r\nupon the trunk and afterward upon the extremities; the breathing\r\nbecomes easy, and, the diarrhoea having already ceased, convalescence\r\nis established. But in proportion to the severity of the symptoms, the\r\nintensity and duration of the cold stage, the cramps, and the\r\nevacuations, will there be a tendency to febrile reaction, with more\r\nor less passive congestion of the internal organs, and therefore a\r\nslower return to health. If the attack has been very severe, and\r\nparticularly if the algid stage has been prolonged, fever of a low\r\ntype is apt to occur, and indeed may terminate fatally. This fever\r\npresents all the characters of the typhoid state, and is marked by\r\ndryness of the tongue, a brown crust upon the teeth and gums, jerking\r\nof the tendons, delirium, and coma. These symptoms are partly\r\nevidences of exhaustion, of inability of the system to resume its\r\nnormal action, and perhaps also they denote the retention of the\r\neffete products of nutrition in the blood; but sometimes they appear\r\nto be associated {735} with, and caused by, a local and latent\r\ninflammation of low grade, established usually in the lungs. Again,\r\nthe nervous system seems to bear the brunt of the reactionary effort,\r\nand the patient is attacked by convulsions or perishes in an\r\napoplectic fit. These phenomena appear to be due in most instances, if\r\nnot in all, to renal obstruction, and, as it is supposed that their\r\nimmediate cause is the retention of urea in the blood, they have\r\nreceived the title of uræmic. In other cases a wasting diarrhoea, due\r\nprobably to the damaged state of the intestinal mucous membrane, is\r\nsuperadded to the already existing typhoid state. Occasionally the\r\nparotid glands become enlarged and painful, and sometimes a measly or\r\nroseolous eruption appears upon the skin.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that the convalescence from cholera is slow and\r\nirregular. The system seems to be shattered by the trial it has passed\r\nthrough; the nervous susceptibility is for a long time morbidly\r\nincreased, or, what is still more usual, the digestive function is\r\ngreatly impaired. The appetite is capricious and the digestion feeble.\r\nThe mouth is pasty, the abdomen tympanitic, the bowels are irregular\r\nand alternately confined and relaxed. Finally, patients who leave the\r\nbed too soon or indulge prematurely in their ordinary diet are liable\r\nto a relapse, perhaps fatally, into the original disease. It has\r\nsometimes happened that such a relapse has taken place several days\r\nafter an apparent restoration to perfect health.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELÆ.--In a small proportion of cases, as above\r\nstated, cutaneous eruptions have been observed during the attack of\r\ncholera, or rather during its decline, for they coincide with the\r\nreaction or follow it, and may be regarded as indications of\r\nincreasing vitality. They belong to the exanthematous class, and\r\ncomprise roseola, erythema, urticaria, and rarely vesicular\r\neruptions.[37] But, instead of them, there may occur destructive\r\ntissue-lesions in the form of abscesses or ulcers. These affections\r\nare more usual on the limbs than on the trunk or face, but some of\r\nthem may appear even in the mouth or fauces. Profuse sweats have been\r\nnoticed elsewhere, and the important fact that they carry off large\r\nquantities of urea, which they deposit upon the skin. Diphtherial\r\nexudation has also been met with upon tender parts of the skin and in\r\nthe fauces, as well as in the stomach and intestine. In some epidemics\r\nof cholera suppuration of the parotid gland is occasionally observed,\r\nwhile in others it may be entirely absent. Instances have been\r\nreported of double parotitis, and in several of them the termination\r\nof the attack was fatal. Still more rarely suppuration of the\r\nsubmaxillary or the cervical glands has been met with. Another sequela\r\nof cholera is a tetanic contraction of the flexor muscles of the\r\nlimbs. Between the tenth and fifteenth days of convalescence the\r\npatient is attacked with a tearing, rending pain in the hands and\r\nforearms, the legs and feet, followed by tonic contraction of the\r\nflexor muscles of these parts. The sensibility is not impaired. The\r\nattack lasts for one or several days, and seems always to end in\r\nrecovery (Guterbock).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Compare _London Hosp. Reports_, iii. 457.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the individual symptoms of cholera call for a more detailed\r\nnotice than they have received in the foregoing epitome, in which the\r\ncontinuity of the narrative could not be interrupted by a description\r\nof variations depending upon the stage and grade of the disease.\r\n\r\n{736} The first to be considered is the temperature. The animal\r\ntemperature in cholera varies according to the part of the body at\r\nwhich it is taken more than in any other disease. In cases of average\r\nseverity it rarely falls below 95° F. in the axilla. The temperature\r\nunder the tongue does not furnish trustworthy indications. In the\r\nstage of asphyxia it seldom exceeds 87.8° F., and even in cases that\r\nrecover it may fall to about 78.8° F. (Wunderlich). In the cold stage\r\nit is not uncommon for a difference of temperature to be noted of\r\nnearly ten degrees between the axilla and the rectum. In a female aged\r\nthirty-two the temperature in the axilla was 93° F., and that in the\r\nvagina 102.8° F. (Mackenzie). In other cases a vaginal temperature of\r\n104° F., and even of 108.32° F., has been reached (Guterbock). Such\r\nhigh temperatures furnish an unfavorable prognosis. As Wunderlich has\r\npointed out, during the algid stage temperatures taken in the mouth do\r\nnot give an accurate idea of the general temperature; the rectal and\r\nvaginal temperatures are more nearly correct. The following are some\r\nresults of thermometry in 74 cases of cholera: Lorain found the\r\nminimum rectal temperature in 1 case 93.2° F., in 2 cases 95°, and in\r\n10 cases 96.8°. In 47 cases the normal temperature was preserved; in\r\n27 it rose to 100.4°; in 15 cases to 102.2°; and in 1 to 104° F.\r\nLeubuscher gives the average temperature in the armpit 92.7° F.; under\r\nthe tongue, 90.5°; upon the tongue, 81.5°, in the nostrils, 79.2°; and\r\non the palm of the hand, 84° F. These numbers, however, only represent\r\naverages. It should be noted that the low temperature of the mouth and\r\nnostrils is caused not only by the evaporation from the surface of\r\nthose cavities, but also by the relative coldness of the expired air,\r\ndue to the partial suspension of the passage of blood through the\r\nlungs, and therefore to the heating of the air contained in them.\r\nAccording to Leubuscher also, the lowest temperature is found in the\r\nnostrils, and next under the tongue, and at the latter point it may\r\nvary from 79° F. to 90.5° F. In death by asphyxia the vaginal and\r\nrectal temperatures may rise to 104°-108° F. The axillary fluctuates\r\nless than the internal temperature. It is remarkable that during the\r\nalgid stage the patients, at least before the temperature has reached\r\nits minimum, are not conscious of their coldness, but, on the\r\ncontrary, complain of internal heat, precisely as happens in the\r\ncongestive forms of periodical fever. When the febrile reaction\r\nassumes a typhoid type the temperature in many cases is normal or only\r\nslightly elevated, and it is of serious import if the temperature then\r\nsinks again below the normal grade (Wunderlich). On the whole, the\r\nmaintenance of a uniform temperature, neither much above or below 90°\r\nF. in the axilla or under the tongue, may be regarded as favorable,\r\nyet recoveries have taken place even when the temperature at these\r\npoints has fallen to 79° F. If the temperature of the parts just\r\nmentioned should rise rapidly to 104° F., it may be regarded as a very\r\nunfavorable sign.\r\n\r\nThe skin, as has elsewhere been described, is pallid, bluish,\r\nshrunken, and cold, and quite destitute of its natural firmness and\r\nelasticity, so that when it is pinched into folds they subside very\r\nslowly, as if they had been made on the skin of a corpse. It is\r\ncurious that, although the drain of liquids through the bowels is so\r\ngreat, the skin not only remains moist, but generally is bathed in a\r\nprofuse cold sweat. Although the secretion of urine is reduced or\r\nquite suspended, that of milk is said to be not {737} always so. Large\r\nquantities of urea have been found in the urine, and in some cases it\r\nhas been visible upon the skin in the form of white scales. During\r\nconvalescence the skin may be the seat of the various eruptions\r\nalready enumerated. Of a graver nature, but, fortunately, of rarer\r\noccurrence, are erysipelas, boils, abscesses, ulcers, and gangrene.\r\nThese several affections seem to result from the alternate obstruction\r\nand freedom of the cutaneous circulation. They commonly appear first\r\nupon the limbs, and afterward upon the face or trunk; they may affect\r\neven the cavity of the mouth. Some observers have noted a relatively\r\nfrequent occurrence of diphtherial exudations in this disease, while\r\nothers do not allude to their existence. The former describe the false\r\nmembrane as affecting not only the mouth and fauces, but also the\r\nstomach, the intestine, and the female organs of generation. A case is\r\nreported by Joseph of a young man who, after an attack of cholera, was\r\naffected with a blenorrhoea, due to a diphtherial inflammation of the\r\nurethra.\r\n\r\nThe character of the heart- and pulse-beats in this disease is quite\r\npeculiar. Their rate does not increase indefinitely, as it does after\r\nhemorrhage; the pulse usually varies from 90 to 110, and indeed seldom\r\nexceeds 120, but its volume, tension, and force progressively decline\r\nuntil the beats become imperceptible at the wrist, and even in the\r\nbrachial and femoral arteries. At the same time, the rhythm of the\r\nheart is interrupted, the energy of its impulse declines until it can\r\nno longer be felt, and its sounds grow weaker and weaker until they\r\nbecome quite inaudible. Sometimes, it is said, a pericardial friction\r\nsound may be heard, which is attributed to the dryness of the\r\npericardium. That the decline and suspension of the heart's sounds and\r\nimpulse are due not only to the weakness of the cardiac muscle, but\r\nalso to the lessened volume of the circulating blood, is proved by the\r\nfact that they persist, sometimes for many hours, after reaction has\r\ncommenced, and only become audible again when the arteries have been\r\nreplenished with blood.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the symptoms of cholera it has been mentioned\r\nthat the cyanotic color of the skin is produced by an accumulation of\r\nblood in the veins. Many years ago Magendie, and after him\r\nDieffenbach, on examining the arteries of persons in the advanced\r\nstage of cholera, found those vessels empty of blood. It might be\r\nsupposed that, under the circumstances, not only the right side of the\r\nheart, but also the lungs, would be gorged with blood, and that\r\nextreme dyspnoea would result. But, in point of fact, the respiration\r\nin cholera is hurried and shallow rather than oppressed and labored,\r\nwhile after death the lungs are not engorged with blood, but rather in\r\na bloodless condition. The pulmonary artery and its branches are also\r\nempty, although the right side of the heart may be filled with dark\r\nand soft coagula. These singular conditions seem to be due, on the one\r\nhand, to the greatly diminished mass of the blood in the vessels, and\r\nto its accumulating and stagnating in various parts of the venous\r\nsystem, and, on the other hand, to the weakness of the heart, which is\r\nshown by its suppressed impulse and sounds, and which lessens its\r\npower to propel the venous blood into the lungs. The infarction of the\r\nsystemic veins and the threatening suspension of the circulation\r\nnecessarily impair the activity of all the functions, including those\r\nof nutrition and disintegration, so that the effete detritus of the\r\neconomy tends to accumulate in the blood. This tendency is {738}\r\ndoubtless counterbalanced not only by the diarrhoea, but also, more or\r\nless, by the almost total suspension of nutrition, due to the\r\ninability of the cholera patient to digest or even to retain food, as\r\nwell as by the diminished oxidation of the blood in the lungs. It has\r\nalready been observed that, to a certain extent, the impediment to the\r\npassage of the blood from the right side of the heart into the\r\nramifications of the pulmonary artery tends to prevent congestion and\r\ninfarction of the lungs. But this obstruction is precisely what occurs\r\nduring the stage of reaction in many cases, which then terminate\r\nfatally by asphyxia, as in the previous stage still more perish by\r\napnoea.\r\n\r\nIn the milder attacks of cholera vomiting may not occur, and in the\r\nmost severe it not unusually is suspended for some time before death,\r\nalthough the diarrhoea may continue. In the most malignant cases,\r\nindeed, there may be no vomiting at all, in consequence of the extreme\r\nmuscular exhaustion, although the stomach may be distended with\r\nliquid. When rejected, the liquid has the general aspect of\r\nrice-water, which the stools also present. Its reaction is alkaline or\r\nneutral, and it is said to contain a less proportion than the stools\r\nof solid matter, but a larger proportion of urea. The act of vomiting\r\nis strictly one of regurgitation, which is performed without effort or\r\npain. Sometimes, indeed, it seems to relieve the sense of weight\r\ncaused by the accumulated contents of the stomach. It is readily\r\nexcited by attempts to drink, and even by slight changes of posture.\r\nThe vomited liquid at first contains the various articles of food the\r\npatient may have eaten. Their half-digested remains have sometimes\r\nsuggested the announcement of strange specific forms of cholera germs.\r\nThe liquid, after ceasing to be colored brownish or greenish, becomes\r\ngray, and subsequently, in favorable cases, more or less green again;\r\nwhile during the stage of reaction in grave and ultimately fatal cases\r\nit is more or less reddened by an admixture of blood. Its most usual\r\nand characteristic appearance is that of a grayish liquid containing\r\nwhitish flocculi. The nature of this liquid, whether discharged by\r\nvomiting or by purging, has been variously estimated. Formerly, some\r\npersons held the white granules to be leucocytes, but the greater\r\nnumber agree that they are mainly epithelial fragments. When the\r\nvomited liquid is allowed to stand, a sediment forms in it which is\r\ncomposed almost entirely of epithelial scales, more or less modified\r\nin their appearance by the accidental contents of the stomach, and a\r\nfilm covers its surface in which globules of fat and phosphatic\r\ncrystals may be detected. They are frequently associated with sarcinæ,\r\nproduced by fermentation in the contents of the stomach, and after\r\nstanding for some time the liquid becomes crowded with vibrios\r\n(Lindsay).\r\n\r\nAlthough the propensity of the sick to discover a cause for every\r\nsymptom often leads cholera patients to attribute their diarrhoea to\r\nsome particular exposure to cold, error of diet, etc., yet, in fact,\r\nthis symptom, so far as it belongs to cholera, is primarily an effect\r\nof the cholera poison alone, although it may be aggravated by causes\r\nlike those mentioned. It is of great practical importance to bear in\r\nmind that a specific choleraic diarrhoea--that is to say, a diarrhoea\r\nproduced by the cholera poison alone--may continue to be very slight\r\nas long as it lasts, which may be for several weeks; and hence, as\r\nelsewhere insisted upon, a person who is not suspected of being\r\naffected with cholera may, quite ignorantly, sow {739} the seeds of a\r\ndeadly epidemic of the disease. The danger in cholera is proportioned\r\nto the volume of the discharges rather than to their frequency, just\r\nas a single profuse hemorrhage is more serious than the loss of an\r\nequal amount of blood divided among several successive days. The\r\nspecial danger, however, is not, as in hemorrhage, from syncope, but\r\nfrom the progressive loss by drainage of the water of the blood,\r\nrendering it unfit to circulate, and therefore causing it to stagnate\r\nin the veins. The spoliative operation of the diarrhoea has\r\noccasionally been productive of benefit instead of injury, as in the\r\nfollowing case of Barlow: A man suffering from dropsy was attacked\r\nwith cholera, \"and passed gallons of liquid by stool, had cramps, and\r\nbecame livid and clammy, but his pulse did not disappear, as in\r\nprofound collapse, and he eventually rallied, and left the hospital\r\napparently well. When he began to recover from cholera his appearance\r\nwas almost ludicrous, from the manner in which the integument hung\r\nloosely about him.\"\r\n\r\nThe stools pass through a series of changes corresponding to those of\r\nthe matters vomited, being fecal at first, and then becoming colorless\r\nand watery. During reaction, if that occurs, they regain more or less\r\nof their proper color, but if typhoid febrile symptoms prevail they\r\nare usually bloody. Decomposed blood sometimes renders them dark,\r\ntarry, and fetid; this condition has caused them sometimes to be\r\ndescribed as being composed of vitiated bile, which is, however, a\r\nproduct not of the liver, but of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn the intestine after death considerable quantities of epithelium are\r\nfound floating in the contained liquid or else loosely adherent to the\r\nmucous membrane. It is usually in flocculi, but sometimes in fragments\r\nlarge enough to form a continuous membrane. A microscopic examination\r\nof cholera stools shows that their turbidness depends chiefly upon\r\ndesquamated epithelium, with which is mixed white corpuscles and\r\nbacteria. It is remarkable that although the stools are drained\r\ndirectly and so rapidly from the blood-vessels, they nevertheless\r\ncontain but little albumen, indeed hardly more than a trace of it. If,\r\nhowever, blood is mixed with the stools, as happens in rare instances,\r\nmore albumen is present. Oil-globules are most abundant in cases that\r\nhave passed beyond the stage of collapse into that of reaction with\r\nfever. In these it is said that oily matter may be found either in\r\nconcrete masses or as a scum of liquid oil. Of inorganic constituents\r\nthey contain crystals of the triple phosphate of ammonium and\r\nmagnesium and chloride of sodium in greatest abundance, but the\r\nproportion of ammonium and potassium salts is small. Indeed, the total\r\namount of solids does not exceed 2 per cent. As the quantity of water\r\nin the blood and solids is limited, and as in this disease the stomach\r\nwill not receive nor retain any liquid, it follows that the more\r\nprofuse the evacuations are, the shorter must be the duration of the\r\nattack, for the sooner then does the blood become too thick to\r\ncirculate.\r\n\r\nIt has several times been stated that in cholera the urine is\r\ndiminished, and that, therefore, the blood retains a larger proportion\r\nof effete products than in health. But it has also been remarked that\r\nthe amount of these products is abnormally small, on account of the\r\ninterference with nutrition of the abnormal state of the circulation.\r\nDoubtless, as in other cases of renal obstruction, an increased\r\nproportion of effete matter is eliminated by the skin, if not by the\r\nbowels. When the amount of {740} urine excreted is only diminished,\r\nits specific gravity may vary between remote extremes, as 1.012 and\r\n1.030. Usually, however, when its quantity is very greatly reduced,\r\nsymptoms which are described as uræmic are apt to arise, and the urine\r\nis found to contain the usual products of renal congestion--viz.\r\nalbumen, sometimes traces of blood, hyaline and granular casts, and\r\nepithelial scales, with less chloride of sodium and more urea than\r\nnormal. It is remarkable that at the beginning of convalescence the\r\nurine, which had been suppressed or greatly diminished, may become for\r\na time abnormally abundant. Rarely, if ever, does the derangement of\r\nthe kidneys now described denote or produce an organic lesion in those\r\norgans. Like the disorders elsewhere, these are due to the loss of\r\nbalance between the arterial and the venous sides of the circulation;\r\nboth, indeed, have lost their functions more or less, the one by lack\r\nof blood, the other by an excess of blood unfit for circulation.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of cramps in cholera, which has bestowed upon the\r\ndisease one of its titles, spasmodic, has, however, no distinctive\r\nrelation to the Asiatic disease. Spasmodic phenomena occur in many\r\ncases of poisoning by corrosive and irritant agents and in ordinary\r\ncholera morbus, and in cholera infantum they are among the most\r\nalarming symptoms, assuming, as they often do, the character of\r\ngeneral convulsions. In most of these cases they are clonic and\r\ngeneral, and therefore probably of central origin, primary or\r\nreflected; but the spasms of cholera are tonic, and affect the muscles\r\nof the upper and lower limbs, and most frequently the flexor muscles\r\nof these parts, and especially those of the fingers and toes, which\r\nbecome rigidly bent. The larger muscles contract into hard lumps, and\r\neven those of the chest and abdomen do not escape the terrible spasms.\r\nWhen they are severe they extort cries from patients who at other\r\ntimes seem quite apathetic. It is stated by Macnamara that the natives\r\nof Southern Bengal and other people of relatively loose fibre are much\r\nless apt to be attacked by them than the natives of the upper country\r\nor than Europeans. It may be debated whether their immediate cause is\r\na reflex irritation emanating from the gastro-intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane; or whether it is due to the rapid diminution of the supply\r\nof blood to the nervous centres, or to the infarction of those centres\r\nwith thick and imperfectly oxygenated blood; or, finally, whether it\r\nis occasioned by a diminished supply of blood, and that blood of bad\r\nquality, to the muscles themselves. Probably all of these factors are\r\nassociated causes in producing the spasmodic phenomena of cholera. It\r\nis well worthy of notice, however, that spasms, which are so frequent\r\nin all infantile diseases, and especially in those affecting the\r\nstomach and bowels, rarely attack children suffering from cholera.\r\nThis would seem to prove that the spasms in question are not reflex,\r\nbut either central and spinal, or else muscular--an inference which is\r\nstrengthened by their being tonic and not clonic. As stated, the\r\nspasms, or cramps, frequently affect the limbs, but comparatively\r\nseldom involve the muscles of the chest or abdomen, and those of the\r\nface hardly ever. They are almost the only causes of pain in the\r\ndisease, which in not a few instances runs its whole course, even to a\r\nfatal termination, without their occurrence.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the abdomen is not so much retracted as might be expected\r\nfrom the profuse discharges. Probably in some degree its form is\r\nmaintained by the constantly recurring accumulation of liquid in the\r\n{741} gastro-intestinal cavity. In protracted cases, however, the\r\nabdomen becomes sunken and hollowed. At all stages of the disease it\r\nis somewhat sore under pressure, especially at the epigastrium, and it\r\ngenerally has a doughy feel. As to the functions of the digestive\r\norgans, they are completely suspended during a typical attack of the\r\ndisease. Not only are these organs incompetent to digest food, but\r\nthey cannot even retain it.\r\n\r\nThroughout such an attack not only is sleep apt to be prevented by the\r\npain of the cramps and the frequent evacuations, but, as a rule, the\r\npatient is wakeful, and yet, apart from the restlessness which\r\naccompanies the paroxysms of pain, there is, on the whole, a tendency\r\nto a placid quietness. Mental excitement and delirium are probably\r\nunknown during the primary attack, but sometimes a degree of\r\nsomnolence or of apathetic tranquillity exists, which, however, is\r\nquite distinct from coma. When the attack is prolonged, and especially\r\nwhen it merges into a typhoid state, the eyes become inflamed by their\r\nexposure to the air. The conjunctiva then grows blood-shot, and\r\noccasionally the cornea is ulcerated.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY AND PATHOLOGY.--The appearance after death of a person\r\nwho has died in the collapse of cholera is very characteristic. It\r\ncomprises a shrunken aspect of the whole body, its prevalent grayish\r\nor leaden pallor contrasting with the livid hue of the abdomen and\r\nback, the fingers and toes, the lips and eyelids, and ears; the eyes\r\nare sunken deeply in their orbits; the nose is sharp and bent, the\r\ntemples are hollow, and the skin seems to cling tightly to the bones\r\nbeneath it. The connective tissue is very dry, and the muscles are\r\nhard as well as dry, and, owing to the wasting of the softer parts,\r\nstand prominently out. In consequence of the absence of moisture\r\ndecomposition takes place very slowly. Cadaveric rigidity is very\r\nmarked and persistent. A very notable phenomenon is the occurrence of\r\nmuscular contraction after death. It may be excited mechanically or\r\nmay occur spontaneously. A case is related (Eichhorst) in which three\r\nhours after death the fibres of the biceps were observed to move\r\ntremulously, and then the entire muscle contracted, causing flexion of\r\nthe forearm. Even the fingers performed movements like those made in\r\npiano-playing. The lower jaw has also been observed to move, causing\r\nthe mouth to open and shut repeatedly. The late Sir Thomas Watson long\r\nago described this singular phenomenon as follows: \"A quarter or half\r\nan hour, or even longer, after the breathing had ceased, and all other\r\nsigns of animation had departed, slight, tremulous, spasmodic\r\ntwitchings and quiverings and vermicular motions of the muscles would\r\ntake place, and even distinct movements of the limbs, in consequence\r\nof these spasms.\"[38] It was carefully studied by Barlow, from whose\r\nnarrative the following is taken: The patient was a strong man; the\r\ncourse of his attack was rapid, and he suffered most cruelly from\r\ncramps. \"Within two minutes of his ceasing to breathe muscular\r\ncontractions began, becoming more and more numerous. The lower\r\nextremities were first affected. Not only were the sartorius, rectus,\r\nvasti, and other muscles thrown into violent spasmodic movements, but\r\nthe limbs were rotated forcibly and the toes were frequently bent. The\r\nmotions ceased and returned; they varied also: now one muscle moved,\r\nnow many. Quite {742} as remarkable were the movements of the arm: the\r\ndeltoid and biceps muscles were peculiarly influenced; occasionally\r\nthe forearm was flexed upon the arm--flexed completely, and when I\r\nstraightened it, which I did several times, its position was recovered\r\ninstantly. The fingers and thumbs were now and then contracted, and at\r\ntimes the thumbs were separately moved. The fibres of the pectoral\r\nmuscles were often in full action; distinct bundles of them were seen\r\nat intervals beneath the skin.... After I had taken leave of the body\r\nthe nurse was horrified by a movement of the lower jaw, which was\r\nfollowed by others; and I thought for a moment that the man was alive.\r\nThe facial muscles became generally affected, and at length all was\r\nstill.\"[39] These muscular contractions succeed one another in a\r\nregular order, beginning in one lower extremity and extending to the\r\nother, then to the upper limbs, and finally to the face. Their degree\r\nvaries from a slight quivering to a powerful contraction, and their\r\nduration from a minute or less to an hour and a quarter. Cases have\r\noccurred in which the legs were so forcibly retracted that they could\r\nwith difficulty be straightened again. In one case, six hours after\r\ndeath movements took place in one leg, and the hand was drawn across\r\nthe chest; in another, \"the forearms were powerfully flexed, and the\r\nhands, approximating, gave the attitude of praying to the body.\"[40]\r\nAgain, Mr. Ward reports: \"I saw the eyes of my dead patient open and\r\nmove slowly in a downward direction. This was followed, a minute or\r\ntwo subsequently, by the movement of the right arm (previously lying\r\nby the side) across the chest.\" In the same paper Barlow says: \"Mr.\r\nLawrence mentioned to me that a gentleman who died in 1832 of rapid\r\ncholera was turned after death completely on the side by a strange and\r\nforcible combination of muscular contractions.\"[41] These muscular\r\nphenomena after death form an interesting feature in the history of\r\ncholera, but they are by no means peculiar to that disease. They have\r\nbeen observed in other diseases, and especially in yellow fever--an\r\naffection in which the pathological condition is quite unlike that of\r\ncholera. In both diseases they have been manifested in robust persons\r\nand when the course of the fatal attack was both rapid and severe.\r\nThus, Dr. Dowler of New Orleans not only found that they could be\r\ndeveloped in such cases of yellow fever by striking the muscles, but\r\nhe observed their spontaneous occurrence in several, of which the\r\nfollowing is a remarkable example: \"Not long after the cessation of\r\nthe respiration the left hand was carried by a regular motion to the\r\nthroat, and then to the crown of the head; the right arm followed the\r\nsame route on the right side; the left arm was then carried back to\r\nthe throat, and thence to the breast, reversing all its original\r\nmotions, and finally the right hand and arm did exactly the same.\"[42]\r\nIn 1860, Drasche alleged that not unusually the skin covering the\r\ncontracting muscles became reddish, while the local temperature rose\r\n1/2°, and that as soon as the contractions ceased the temperature fell\r\nbelow the normal and cadaveric rigidity set in. According to the same\r\nobserver, analogous contractions affect the unstriped muscular fibres,\r\nin those of the skin producing a projection of the papillæ, and in the\r\ngenital organs a discharge of semen. This phenomenon is said to have\r\noccurred an hour and a half after death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Lectures_, Am. ed. of 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _London Med. Gaz._, Nov., 1849, p. 798.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Ibid._, Jan., 1850, p. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Ibid._, pp. 185, 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Experimental Researches_, 1846.]\r\n\r\n{743} On opening the abdominal cavity of persons who have died in the\r\ncollapse of cholera one is struck by the general pink or rose tint of\r\nthe peritoneal coat of the intestines. It is produced by a repletion\r\nof the minute branches of the portal venous system. Sometimes the\r\ncolor is rendered very dark by the pitchy blood contained in the\r\nveins. The surface of the peritoneum, like all the tissues, is\r\nsingularly dry, and often has a soapy or sticky feel, caused by a\r\nlayer of albuminous matter, which forms a lather when rubbed between\r\nthe fingers, and causes the intestinal folds to adhere to one another.\r\nIf death takes place during the stage of reaction, these appearances\r\nare less distinct, and the intestines, which in collapse are usually\r\nretracted, are then somewhat distended.\r\n\r\nThe stomach generally contains a thin, partially transparent liquid of\r\na greenish or grayish color, and occasionally reddish, holding in\r\nsuspension portions of coagulated mucus and an unctuous substance of\r\nan albuminous nature, which adheres to the walls of the cavity. Fatty\r\nglobules may be observed floating in the liquid, which under the\r\nmicroscope reveals epithelial débris, granular corpuscles, and\r\nfragments of gastric glands. Under heat and nitric acid coagulation of\r\nthe liquid occurs, and on chemical examination it is found to contain\r\nurea. The gastric mucous membrane is of a dark violet or pale pink\r\ncolor, according to the stage of the disease; its follicles are\r\nenlarged, and patches of superficial abrasion may be observed on it.\r\n\r\nThe intestinal canal of those who die during the collapse of cholera\r\nis, in the majority of cases, partially filled with liquid which has\r\nthe aspect of turbid serum, more or less mixed with the previous\r\ncontents of the bowel if death has taken place very rapidly, but\r\notherwise it is almost colorless. On the whole, however, it is less\r\npale and watery than the stools. It contains, like these discharges,\r\nmore or less epithelial flocculi, and generally more than were\r\nobserved during life in the dejections. The mucus scraped from the\r\nlining membrane of the intestine and mixed with water renders it\r\nturbid with epithelial débris. The same mucus examined microscopically\r\ncontains fragments, larger or smaller, of epithelium. These conditions\r\nare said to predominate in the large intestine. Indeed, the proportion\r\nof liquid increases from above downward. Hence in the more prolonged\r\ncases the contents of the bowel at its upper part are less liquid and\r\nare darker in color. There is, indeed, a striking contrast between the\r\nappearance of the intestine in cases which have terminated in collapse\r\nand its aspect in persons who have died during the stage of reaction.\r\nIt has been clearly presented by Dr. Sutton.[43] When death took place\r\nin \"the cold stage the mucous membrane was unusually pale in three\r\ncases; in two it was healthy-looking; in other two it was pale\r\nthroughout, excepting that one or two of Peyer's patches were\r\ncongested; and in the remaining three there was more or less\r\ncongestion of the mucous membrane. When the mucous membrane was pale\r\nthroughout the entire intestine, the valvulæ conniventes looked\r\nswollen and oedematous, and the color of the membrane was dead white.\r\nThe solitary glands were very distinct and prominent. Those of the\r\nduodenum were remarkably so. In cases of imperfect reaction the mucous\r\nmembrane of the intestine was usually found very much congested and\r\necchymosed. The congested portions were sometimes {744} granular, and\r\napparently denuded of epithelium. The mucous surface had often a dark\r\nport-wine color, due to the extravasated blood and the hyperæmia, and\r\nhere and there the surface was covered with a dirty gray membranous\r\nsubstance, likened to a diphtheritic deposit. I have, however, seen no\r\ndecided false membrane, such as could be peeled off, as in diphtheria.\r\nThe surface was also occasionally bile-stained, and the\r\ngreenish-yellow color of the bile and the deep red color of the\r\ncongested surface presented a very striking appearance. The solitary\r\nglands were very prominent, and in some cases apparently enlarged.\"\r\nThe general paleness of the intestinal mucous membrane in the stage of\r\ncollapse, and its congestive redness whenever the signs of reaction\r\nhave existed before death, have a very important bearing upon the\r\npathology of this disease, for they demonstrate conclusively that the\r\ngastro-intestinal evacuations in cholera have no relation whatever to\r\ninflammation. On the other hand, they render it altogether probable\r\nthat the serous flux is in the nature of a sweat, an intestinal\r\nephidrosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _London Hosp. Clin. Lect. and Reports_, iv. 497.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the exfoliation found in the intestinal canal has been\r\nthe subject of much discussion. As long ago as the first American\r\nepidemic of cholera (1832-35) Dr. W. E. Horner, Professor of Anatomy\r\nin the University of Pennsylvania, described an exfoliation of the\r\nepithelial lining of the alimentary canal, whereby the extremities of\r\nthe venous system of the part are denuded, as being characteristic of\r\ncholera alone. In 1849, Dr. Samuel Jackson, Professor of the\r\nInstitutes of Medicine, and Dr. John Neill, Demonstrator of Anatomy in\r\nthe University, in conjunction with Dr. William Pepper and Dr. Paul B.\r\nGoddard, presented a report to the College of Physicians of\r\nPhiladelphia, in which they, too, showed that the \"epithelial layer of\r\nthe intestinal mucous membrane was either entirely removed or was\r\ndetached, adhering loosely.\" This important fact--the most important,\r\nperhaps, in the mechanism of cholera--was confirmed seventeen years\r\nlater by the eminent pathologist Dr. Lionel S. Beale,[44] who, when\r\nreferring to \"the remarkable characters of the matter discharged from\r\nthe intestinal tube, and to the fact that the small intestines almost\r\nalways contain a considerable quantity of pale almost colorless\r\ngruel-, rice-, or cream-like matter,\" added: \"This has been proved to\r\nconsist almost entirely of columnar epithelium, and in very many cases\r\nlarge flakes can be found, consisting of several uninjured epithelial\r\nsheaths of the villi.... In bad cases it is probable that almost every\r\nvillus, from the pylorus to the ilio-cæcal valve, has been stripped of\r\nits epithelial coating during life.... These important organs, the\r\nvilli, are, in a very bad case, all or nearly all left bare, and a\r\nvery essential part of what constitutes the absorbing apparatus is\r\ncompletely destroyed.... It is probable that the extent of this\r\nprocess of denudation determines the severity or mildness of the\r\nattack.... It seems probable also that the epithelium may become\r\ndetached in consequence of the almost complete cessation of the\r\ncirculation in the capillaries beneath, but the death of the cells may\r\noccur in consequence of their being exposed to the influence of\r\ncertain matters in the intestine or in the blood, in which case they\r\nwould simply fall off.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Med. Times and Gazette_, Aug., 1866, p. 109.]\r\n\r\nIn this connection, and as complementary of the statements now made,\r\nshould be considered the further description by the same author--viz.:\r\n{745} \"Remarkable changes have occurred in the smaller vessels,\r\nespecially in the capillaries and small veins of the villi and\r\nsubmucous tissue. The blood-corpuscles appear to have in a great\r\nmeasure been destroyed in the smaller vessels, and in their place are\r\nseen clots containing blood-coloring matter, minute granules, and\r\nsmall masses of germinal matter evidently undergoing active\r\nmultiplication. Some of the arteries are contracted, but here and\r\nthere small clots destitute of blood-corpuscles may be seen at\r\nintervals.\" Hence, the gastro-intestinal lesions in cholera, according\r\nto their extent and degree, they remove the natural obstacles to\r\nexhalation in the mucous membrane, and also, and in the same degree,\r\nprevent the absorption of the contents of the alimentary canal. It\r\nmust not, however, be forgotten that this lesion is not altogether\r\npeculiar to the intestinal mucous membrane. Dr. Beale long ago called\r\nattention to the fact that in this disease there seems to be a\r\ntendency to the removal of epithelium from the surface of all soft,\r\nmoist mucous membranes, but not from the follicles of the glands. The\r\nfirst statement appears to be explicable by the shrinkage of all the\r\nmucous membranes during cholera collapse, for by this merely\r\nmechanical agency the inelastic epithelium must necessarily become\r\ndetached. As to the second statement, the remark may be made that the\r\nwhole follicular structure furnished with columnar epithelium is an\r\nabsorbing and not an eliminating apparatus, and that, since its\r\nfunctional activity is from the beginning of the disease diminished by\r\nan inadequate blood-supply, it can have but a small and indirect share\r\nin generating the phenomena of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Dr. Koch, during his investigations of cholera in India,\r\nfound bacilli in the bowel which he believed to be peculiar to the\r\ndisease, and which presented the following characters: they were not\r\nstraight, like other bacilli, but curved or comma-shaped; they\r\nproliferated rapidly and displayed very active movements. Bodies of\r\npersons who died of various other diseases did not present them,\r\nalthough abounding in different bacteria. The bacilli were not found,\r\nor only exceptionally, in the stomach, but abundantly in the\r\nintestine, and most so in the diarrhoeal discharges that occurred at\r\nthe height of the disease. As soon as the stools began to be fecal the\r\nspecific bacilli disappeared from them. After death at the height of\r\nthe disease they were most abundant in the intestinal contents, and\r\nespecially in the lower part of the small intestine. When death took\r\nplace at a later period none of them might be detected in the liquids\r\nin the bowel, but they would still be present, in considerable\r\nnumbers, in the tubular glands. They were not found at all in cases\r\nfatal from some sequela of the disease.[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Times and Gaz._, Mar., 1884, p. 398.]\r\n\r\nOther abdominal lesions in cholera possess a very subordinate\r\nimportance. The isolated and the agminated glands are both prominent,\r\nchiefly because they are swollen by the liquid imbibed from the bowel.\r\nA whitish substance which they sometimes contain may perhaps be the\r\nalbumen or fat which they have taken from the intestinal liquid. A\r\nvery similar condition of the mesenteric glands is probably due to a\r\nlike cause. The liver is pale and flaccid when death takes place in\r\ncollapse, and it is also described as presenting a \"dirty grayish-red,\r\nhomogeneous appearance, and indistinctness of the lobular structure,\r\nas if some glutinous matter had been poured throughout the tissues of\r\nthe organ\" {746} (Sutton). This appearance would seem to be due to the\r\ntotal suspension of the blood-supply through the portal vein.\r\n\r\nAt all stages of the disease the gall-bladder is usually found full of\r\nbile, which is apt to be dark during the collapse and more watery\r\nafter reaction has commenced.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is small, pale, and, as a rule, firm, but occasionally it\r\nis soft.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys present no marked changes when death has taken place early\r\nin the attack, or at most only exhibit a lighter color than usual of\r\nthe cortical substance and a darker one of the pyramids. They show\r\nthat the arteries are comparatively empty and that the veins are\r\ncongested. Similarly contrasted appearances are met after death from\r\nobstructive disease of the heart and other causes that produce\r\nobstruction of the venæ cavæ. In the tubules, later on, fatty\r\ndegeneration of the epithelium has been observed, and some cylindrical\r\ncasts. These alterations, especially of the tubules, are most marked\r\nwhen death occurs in the stage of reaction, and are then apt to be\r\naccompanied by more or less hemorrhagic transudation. The urinary\r\nbladder is always contracted after death in collapse; after febrile\r\nreaction its mucous membrane may be more or less coated with false\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nThe brain and the spinal marrow offer nothing peculiar; their venous\r\nsystems are everywhere more or less engorged, and sometimes effused\r\nblood has been found in the spinal canal.\r\n\r\nIn the state of the respiratory organs the most important facts are\r\nthat in algid cholera the lungs are always more or less collapsed,\r\n\"shrunk and small, and lying back in the chest, toward the spine,\" and\r\nthat, so far from being congested, they are (with the exception of a\r\nsmall portion of their posterior part rendered dense by hypostasis)\r\nsingularly bloodless, dry, and tough. As might be inferred from these\r\nconditions, they are also lighter in weight than natural. To Dr.\r\nParkes belongs the credit of having first described this very\r\nimportant fact in the morbid anatomy of cholera, as follows: \"In\r\nfourteen cases the lungs were completely collapsed, appearing in some\r\ncases like the lungs of a foetus. In three cases they were\r\nconsiderably, in eight slightly, collapsed, and in the remaining\r\nfourteen cases the collapse was in some altogether, and in some\r\npartially, prevented by old adhesions.\"[46] So Dr. Sutton found that\r\nthe average weight of the two lungs during collapse was about twenty\r\nounces, and after reaction--that is, after the passage of the blood\r\ninto the pulmonary artery had become completely re-established--about\r\nforty-five ounces. In the latter condition also the lungs presented\r\nthe usual signs of congestion of those organs, being dark-red\r\nthroughout or in portions only. Sometimes also they contained masses\r\nor nodules of apparent hepatization, and of these some may have\r\nundergone partial softening.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Med. Times_, 1848, p. 378.]\r\n\r\nIn absolute conformity with the condition of the lungs that has been\r\ndescribed is that of the heart. If the lungs are bloodless, it follows\r\nnecessarily that the left side of the heart must be empty, and almost\r\nas necessarily that the right side of the heart must be distended with\r\nblood. All careful investigators of the subject agree that such is the\r\ncondition of the heart when death takes place in cholera during the\r\nstage of {747} asphyxia. All report that the pulmonary artery is\r\neither empty or that it contains a small quantity of dark and usually\r\nof thick blood; that the right side of the heart and the coronary\r\nveins are distended with blood of the same description, while numerous\r\necchymoses exist along the course of the coronary veins; that the venæ\r\ncavæ are filled with half-coagulated blood of a tarry aspect; and that\r\neven the femoral and splenic veins contain similar blood. On the other\r\nhand, the left ventricle of the heart is usually contracted, and\r\ncontains a very little semi-fluid blood, with perhaps a small and pale\r\nclot. This engorged condition of the right cavities and emptiness of\r\nthe left cavities of the heart diminish very slowly during the passage\r\nfrom collapse to reaction, during which time the pulmonary\r\nblood-vessels are being gradually replenished. Besides the thick and\r\ntarry aspect of the blood above described, it has been observed that\r\nwhen the blood is withdrawn by means of a pipette, its globules\r\nrapidly subside and are surmounted by a transparent serum, and that\r\nsuch blood may remain for a long time uncoagulated. The red corpuscles\r\nare said to be pale and viscous, but not adhesive, and the white\r\ncorpuscles abnormally numerous and easily crushed. In the free\r\nintervals are observed \"very pale little objects, slightly elongated\r\nand constricted in their middle,\" which multiplied in blood kept for\r\none or two days at a temperature of 38° C. (100.4° F.).[47] If death\r\ndoes not take place until reaction is far advanced or has merged into\r\na febrile condition, the left ventricle is usually found not\r\ncontracted, and it contains a quantity of blood. The term \"usually\" is\r\nemployed to show that even to this rule there are some exceptions, and\r\nthat, as in all other diseases, the issue does not depend absolutely\r\nand exclusively upon a definite degree of any anatomical lesion, but\r\nupon the aggregate condition of all the functions upon which life\r\ndepends. The pericardium, like the pleura and the peritoneum, may be\r\ncovered with a saponaceous film which is albuminous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Rapport sur le Cholera d'Égypte en 1883_, par M. le Dr.\r\nStrauss, etc.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn looking now over the field that has been traversed in the foregoing\r\npages, and searching for some link that will unite in a consistent\r\nwhole the causes, symptoms, and lesions of cholera, it is evident that\r\nonly one factor can possibly be so described. That factor is the\r\ngastro-intestinal flux. This it is that produces the vomiting and the\r\npurging; that prostrates the patient and wastes away in a few hours\r\nthe fullest and the firmest form; that chills the limbs and afterward\r\nthe trunk; that thickens the blood so that the capillary vessels can\r\nno longer convey it, and that spreads a cyanotic shadow over the whole\r\nsurface of the body; that cuts off the supply of blood from the lungs\r\nand heart; that paralyzes the nervous system, ganglionic as well as\r\ncerebro-spinal; that obstructs the kidneys and arrests their\r\nsecretion; and that, acting through the several links of this\r\npathological chain, becomes the cause of death. But the question still\r\nrecurs, What is the cause of the gastro-intestinal flux? To this also,\r\nin the light of observation, it is possible to give only one answer.\r\nIt is a specific poison which originates in Hindostan, and, being\r\ntaken into the stomach and bowels, not only produces in the individual\r\nthe symptoms and lesions of cholera, but is capable of multiplying\r\nitself and rendering infectious the discharges from the stomach and\r\nbowels of the subjects of the disease, so that it may be transmitted\r\nfrom {748} one person to another round the whole circumference of the\r\nglobe. Regarding the form and nature of that poison little or nothing\r\nis definitely established, beyond what has already been stated as the\r\nresult of Koch's observations. As far as they go, they harmonize with\r\na long-prevalent opinion that the cholera poison consists of certain\r\nmicroscopic germs, which, on being received into the bowels, propagate\r\ntheir kind and destroy the epithelium. It is believed by some that\r\nthese bodies are products of the rice-plant on the banks of the\r\nGanges, and that, having once originated the disease, the germs\r\ncontained in the discharges become mixed with water or are borne upon\r\nthe wind, and enter the system of new victims, who, in their turn,\r\ndisseminate the plague. This theory will be further considered below.\r\n\r\nAnother view, that of B. W. Richardson, is that, \"as pus undergoes\r\nchanges which convert it into a septic poison, so the excreted matter\r\nfrom the alimentary canal is equally capable, under peculiar\r\nconditions of oxidation, of producing an alkaloidal organic poison,\r\nwhich, soluble in water, but admitting of deposit on desiccation,\"\r\nbecomes the agent for disseminating the disease. In these theories a\r\nfalse datum and a hypothesis are offered us in place of the fact which\r\nwe seek. The cryptogamous nature of the essential cause of the disease\r\nhas no positive proof, but only the probability of coincidence in its\r\nfavor. There is no proof, because one after another organic form has\r\nbeen alleged to be the essential generator of the disease, and each\r\nhas been proved to be either not peculiar to cholera or has been shown\r\nto be present in other diseases than cholera.\r\n\r\nAt the present time (1884) it is the fashion to trace every disease to\r\nspecific bacteria or analogous organisms. But it may be that the\r\noccurrence of cholera only furnishes the occasion for the development\r\nof these organisms, just as a certain temperature, hygrometric\r\ncondition, and deficient light and air will cause mould to form on\r\nbread and other organic substances. The judgment pronounced by Dr.\r\nBeale in this question as long ago as 1866 appears now, as it did\r\nthen, to approach the truth upon this point: \"There is no good reason\r\nfor supposing that the bacteria in such numbers in the alimentary\r\ncanal in cholera have anything to do with this disease or with the\r\nfalling off of epithelium from the intestinal and other mucous\r\nmembranes. Bacteria are developed in organic matter which is not\r\ntraversed and protected by the normal fluids of the body, and they\r\ninvade the cells and textures in cholera after those cells and\r\ntextures have undergone serious prior changes, just as they would\r\ninvade textures removed from the body altogether. Nor would it be in\r\naccordance with known facts to infer that cholera was due to the\r\ninvasion of some peculiar form or species of bacterium.\"[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Times and Gazette_, Aug., 1866, p. 167.]\r\n\r\nWe repeat, then, that while nothing can be simpler than the mechanism\r\nof cholera viewed as a gastro-intestinal hyperidrosis, nothing is more\r\nmysterious than the mechanism of the primary cause which gives rise to\r\nit. That its real nature has been correctly described is rendered all\r\nthe more probable by the fact, presently to be insisted upon, that\r\nsporadic cholera morbus, which is always the consequence of a direct\r\nirritation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, is often with\r\ndifficulty distinguishable from Asiatic cholera, which, indeed,\r\ndiffers from the former {749} disease chiefly by the intensity of its\r\ncause as measured by the gravity of its symptoms and by the nature of\r\nthe special agent that produces it.\r\n\r\nThe above views regarding the essential cause of cholera were\r\nsubstantially indited before the Egyptian epidemic of 1883, but they\r\nare in accord with the more definite conclusions arrived at by the\r\nGerman and French commissions on the subject. Before their reports\r\nappeared, however, a communication was made by Dr. Kartulis of the\r\nGreek hospital in Alexandria, setting forth that the drinking-water\r\nand the stools and blood of the cholera patients contained, the first\r\na mass of micro-organisms, and the others bacteria and micrococci,\r\nwhich, however, presented no distinctive characters.[49] The German\r\nreport was prepared by Dr. Koch, the French by Dr. Strauss.[50] The\r\nformer, alluding to the enormous quantity of micro-organisms found in\r\nthe contents of the bowels and in the stools, did not perceive any\r\nconnection between them and the phenomena of the disease. On the other\r\nhand, he did assign this relation to a species of bacterium found in\r\nthe walls of the intestine, and which he compared to the bacilli of\r\nglanders. They were lodged in great quantities within the intestinal\r\nglands and behind their epithelium, as well as upon the surface of the\r\nvilli and within them, and sometimes even in the muscular coat. They\r\nwere most numerous at the lower end of the small intestine. Dr. Koch\r\nconcluded that although these bacilli, beyond doubt, are in some\r\nmanner associated with the development of cholera, they are by no\r\nmeans shown to be its cause, and may indeed be themselves the product\r\nof the morbid conditions belonging to cholera. All his attempts at\r\nthat time to develop cholera in animals by inoculating them with the\r\norganisms gave only negative results. The conclusions of Dr. Strauss\r\nwere in entire conformity with those of Dr. Koch, but involved an\r\nadditional and very important statement--viz. that the shorter and the\r\nmore violent were the fatal attacks of cholera the fewer were the\r\nbacteria found in the intestine. It is evident that this fact is the\r\nvery opposite of what should have been found had bacteria been\r\nessential in the causation of cholera. The more recent investigations\r\nconducted in Calcutta by Dr. Koch, which have already been cited, led\r\nhim, however, to attribute to bacilli of a specific form the absolute\r\norigination of the disease. He poses the question in the following\r\nmanner: Either these \"comma bacilli\" are a product of the cholera\r\nprocess, or \"the disease only arises when these specific organisms\r\nhave found their way into the bowel.\" The former alternative he\r\nrejects, because, in his judgment, it assumes that the bodies in\r\nquestion must be pre-existent in every person who becomes affected\r\nwith the disease--a hypothesis which he rejects, because they have\r\nnever been found except in cholera. He therefore concludes that they\r\nare the cause of cholera. He points out that their first appearance\r\ncoincides with the commencement of the disease, that they increase\r\nwith it, and that they disappear with its decline.[51] The statement\r\nof Strauss quoted above does not, however, appear to harmonize with\r\nthis conclusion, since the bacteria are said by him to have been\r\nfewest in the more violent and fatal attacks of the disease. Another\r\nof Dr. Koch's remarks is also open to criticism. After showing how\r\nrapidly the cholera bacteria multiply when kept moist, he states that\r\nthey die after drying more quickly than almost any other form of\r\nbacteria. \"As {750} a rule, even after three hours' drying every\r\nvestige of life has disappeared.\" It is evident that this statement is\r\nnot in harmony with the numerous facts, several of which have been\r\ncited, that cholera fomites have preserved their infectious qualities\r\nafter several weeks. Dr. Koch endeavored to produce in animals,\r\nartificially, with these bacteria, a disease analogous to cholera, but\r\nwithout success; and he adds, \"If any species of animal whatever could\r\ntake the cholera, it would surely have been observed in Bengal, but\r\nall inquiries directed to this point met with a negative result.\" Dr.\r\nVincent Edwards, who, however, is of opinion that the cholera poison\r\nis \"not an organism, but of the nature of a chemical compound of\r\ncomparatively unstable nature,\" reports that he produced fatal cholera\r\nin pigs by giving them the dejections of cholera patients.[52] But the\r\n_Times and Gazette_ inclines to question that the pigs employed in Dr.\r\nEdwards' experiments were affected with true cholera.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Medical News_, xliii. 377.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Archives gén._, Dec., 1883, pp. 713, 722.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Times and Gaz._, Mar., 1884, p. 398.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Notes on the Poison contained in Choleraic Atomic\r\nDischarges._]\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The most characteristic symptoms of Asiatic cholera have\r\nrepeatedly been mentioned in the foregoing pages. They are rice-water\r\nevacuations by vomiting and purging, rapid emaciation of the whole\r\nbody, a cadaverous hollowness of the cheeks and eyes, a livid color of\r\nthe face, hands, and feet, a feeble, thready, and at last absent\r\npulse, an icy coldness of the extremities, face, and even the breath,\r\na loss of the elasticity of the skin, a thin and feeble voice, and\r\nintense thirst. But every one of these symptoms may occur in cholera\r\nmorbus produced by a direct irritation of the stomach and bowels. It\r\nis rather their nature, we repeat, than their phenomena that\r\ndistinguishes these two affections from each other. In attempting to\r\nseparate Asiatic cholera from other forms of cholera we must endeavor\r\nto dismiss from the mind the erroneous notion that the term cholera\r\ndenotes a definite disease identical in its cause, phenomena, and\r\nresults. It is no more a disease than dropsy or fever is a disease. It\r\nis a complex group of symptoms which have in common the fact that they\r\nproceed directly from gastro-intestinal irritation, whose degree of\r\nseverity--_i.e._ the presence or absence of certain grave\r\nsymptoms--and, above all, its issue, depend chiefly upon the nature\r\nand intensity of the cause of the attack, and also, necessarily, upon\r\nthe degree of resistance opposed to it by the subjects of the disease.\r\nNothing has led to more error in regard to epidemic cholera than the\r\nignorance of this pathological fact by some and the disregard of it by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn the first portion of this article it was shown that the Greek,\r\nRoman, and Arabian conceptions of cholera morbus included a discharge\r\nof bile, the very symptom for the absence of which Asiatic cholera is\r\nnotorious; and also that the classical cholera, or cholera morbus,\r\nended in recovery even more frequently than Asiatic cholera terminates\r\nin death. But local epidemics of cholera morbus sometimes take place\r\nwhich are of a severe and even of a grave type, and which also appear\r\nto originate in some peculiar atmospheric influence, for they prevail\r\nto a limited extent and in connection with vicissitudes of weather.\r\nStill more circumscribed epidemics have been traced to unwholesome\r\nfood and drink, and innumerable instances of individual attacks have\r\nbeen caused by irritants that are ranked as poisons and others which\r\nare reckoned as food or medicines. Now, under these various\r\ncircumstances, which have in common gastro-intestinal irritation,\r\nthere may be produced, if the irritation is excessive, {751} a series\r\nof symptoms closely resembling, if not identical with, those of\r\nAsiatic cholera.\r\n\r\nIn illustration may be cited the comparatively familiar description of\r\nSydenham.[53] These are his words: \"There is vomiting to a great\r\ndegree, and there are also _foul_, _difficult_, and _straining\r\nmotions_ from the bowels. There is _intense pain_ in the belly, there\r\nis _wind_, and there are _distension_, heartburn, and thirst. The\r\npulse is quick and frequent, at times small and unequal. The feeling\r\nof sickness is most distressing, and is accompanied with heat and\r\ndisquiet. The perspiration sometimes amounts to absolute sweating. The\r\nlegs and arms are cramped and the extremities cold. To these symptoms,\r\nand to others of a like stamp, we may add faintness.\" ... \"As the\r\nsummer came to a close the cholera morbus raged epidemically, and,\r\nbeing promoted by the unusual heat of the weather, it brought with it\r\nworse symptoms, in the way of cramps and spasms, than I had ever seen.\r\nNot only, as is generally the case, was the abdomen afflicted with\r\nhorrible cramps, but the arms and legs, indeed the muscles in general,\r\nwere afflicted also.\" ... At the risk of repetition an additional\r\npassage may be quoted from Sydenham's later definition of cholera\r\nmorbus: \"This is _limited_ to the _month of August_ or the first week\r\nor two of _September_. Violent vomiting, accompanied by the dejection\r\nof _depraved humors_, _difficulty on passing them_, _vehement pain_,\r\n_inflation and distension of the bowels_, heartburn, thirst, quick,\r\nfrequent, small, and unequal pulse, heat and anxiety, nausea, sweat,\r\ncramps of the legs and arms, faintings, and coldness of the\r\nextremities, constitute the true cholera--and it kills within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Works_, Sydenham Soc. ed., i. 163; ii. 8, 266.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general likeness between this description and the\r\nsymptoms of Asiatic cholera, there are differences of considerable\r\nimportance which have been italicized in the quotations. These\r\ndifferences are such as may be attributed to the action of a harsh\r\nirritant in the case of cholera morbus, while in the epidemic\r\n(Asiatic) disease the distinctive phenomena are the result of a sudden\r\nand profuse intestinal flux. Macpherson, who had a long and extensive\r\nexperience of epidemic cholera in India, after contrasting in detail\r\nits phenomena with those of cholera nostras, sums up the discussion in\r\nthese words: \"Cholera indica is essentially a very fatal disease,\r\nwhile cholera nostras is usually a mild affection and is seldom fatal,\r\nalthough it was called _atrocissimus et peracutus_, and has\r\nundoubtedly killed in from eight to twenty-four hours.\"[54] In regard\r\nto the individual symptoms this very competent reporter does not\r\nrecognize a single one as being absolutely peculiar to either disease.\r\nEven the ancients, already referred to, after describing bilious\r\nevacuations as being characteristic of cholera nostras, add that\r\nsometimes also they are whitish; and modern writers, both before and\r\nsince the advent of Asiatic cholera in Europe, have made a similar\r\nobservation. Thus, Quinquaud, in his description of cholera nostras,\r\nof which a slight epidemic occurred in 1869 at the Hospital St.\r\nAntoine in Paris, says: \"The principal symptoms were vomiting and\r\npurging, sometimes of a bilious and sometimes of a rice-water liquid;\r\na shrivelled and cyanotic skin, the latter appearance being sometimes\r\nstrongly marked; anxiety, coldness, cramps, altered voice, and\r\nsuppression of urine.\"[55] In 1875 thirty-three cases of this {752}\r\ndisease occurred at Valenciennes, near Paris, and its symptoms were\r\nthus summarized by Manouvriez:[56] \"Repeated vomiting, first of food,\r\nand then of a dark-green liquid; diarrhoea, which was at first fecal\r\nand then bilious, but afterward serous and like rice-water; painful\r\ntension of the epigastrium and tenderness of this part; headache,\r\ncramps in the legs, suppression of urine; pallor, coldness, and\r\ndryness of the skin, especially of the limbs; pinched features, a blue\r\ncircle around the eyes, a small and scarcely perceptible pulse, and a\r\nfaltering and whispering voice.\" Yet of the thirty-three cases only\r\ntwo were fatal--the one a child of four years and the other an infant\r\nof as many months. The substantial identity of nature of these two\r\nlocal epidemics, and the almost equally close relation of their\r\nsymptoms to those of epidemic cholera, must be quite apparent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Times and Gaz._, Dec., 1870, p. 725.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Archives gén._, Mars, 1870, p. 308.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Archives gén._, Sept., 1877, p. 298.]\r\n\r\nYet the contrasts are neither slight nor unimportant; and the most\r\nstriking and significant is the trifling mortality of the European as\r\ncompared with the Asiatic disease, notwithstanding the grave symptoms\r\npresent in the former. It may be regarded as certain, we think, that\r\nthe reason of this difference of danger lies in a corresponding\r\ndifference in the nature of the causes of the two forms of disease.\r\nThe rapid recovery from cholera morbus produced by changes of weather,\r\nacid fruits, and indigestion renders it certain that no material\r\nlesion of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane has been produced;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, inspection after death from epidemic cholera\r\nor by corrosive poisoning renders it equally certain that the damage\r\nto that membrane is substantial and widespread, as well as often\r\nirreparable, and that, therefore, \"the powers of life that resist\r\ndeath\" must be engaged in a very unequal and often fruitless struggle.\r\nThe cramps in cholera nostras are, as a rule, less severe than in\r\nepidemic cholera, while the colicky, and in general the abdominal,\r\npains are greater in the former than in the latter disease. The reason\r\nof this difference appears to be that muscular spasm is the natural\r\nresult of depletion, whether sanguine or serous, while colic is an\r\neffect of irritation of the surface of the mucous coat of the bowel,\r\nand not of its destruction, such as occurs in epidemic cholera.\r\n\r\nIt is true only in a limited degree, and indeed only upon a\r\nsuperficial survey of the symptoms, that the effects of irritant\r\npoisoning are like those produced by Asiatic cholera. The analogy\r\nbetween the two was pointed out, among others, by Sedgwick in\r\n1867.[57] The resemblance appeared so striking to the vulgar eye that\r\nin Paris, and perhaps elsewhere, a popular tumult followed the first\r\nviolent outbreak of epidemic cholera, and it was charged that the\r\nwells had been poisoned. The cases that most resemble cholera are the\r\nfollowing: \"Acute poisoning by corrosive sublimate, by arsenic, and by\r\nmineral acids, especially nitric acid; the effects which follow the\r\neating or drinking of poisonous animal matters, such as tainted or\r\nsimply unwholesome meat or fish, and milk which has undergone some\r\ninjurious but yet unknown change, decomposing vegetables and some of\r\nthe poisonous fungi, and the excessive action of certain drugs, for\r\nthe most part belonging to the class of drastic purgatives,\" as\r\nelaterium and croton oil. The effects produced by these agents\r\nconstitute a cholera morbus, and therefore resemble cholera, and have\r\nbeen occasionally, and almost unavoidably, mistaken for it. It {753}\r\nis remarkable that suppression of urine may occur among them, as well\r\nas vomiting, purging, and collapse. As Griesinger and others have\r\npointed out, the order in which the symptoms occur is a valuable, and\r\ngenerally an available, ground of diagnosis. In cholera, diarrhoea\r\nalways occurs before vomiting, while in the various irritant\r\npoisonings mentioned vomiting precedes diarrhoea. In irritant\r\npoisoning also there is generally severe abdominal pain--not so much\r\ncolicky and paroxysmal as constant and burning; the stools are not so\r\ncopious as in cholera, and they do not possess the rice-water aspect,\r\nbut are rather dark, bloody, and fetid, and are voided with tenesmus\r\nor with heat in the anus; and even when the urine is suppressed it is\r\nless persistently and completely so than in cholera, and attempts to\r\nvoid it are attended with vesical tenesmus and strangury. In a\r\ndoubtful case it is important to ascertain whether a metallic or other\r\nunpleasant taste is perceived in the mouth, whether this cavity or the\r\nthroat bears marks of corrosion, whether any unusual article of food\r\nhas been used, etc. Moreover, it is of extreme importance to learn\r\nwhether Asiatic cholera prevails, not merely in the immediate\r\nneighborhood, but at any place from which diseased persons or infected\r\ngoods may have arrived. The instances should not be forgotten in which\r\ncholera-infected clothing from Europe has developed the disease in the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi. Nor should those still more numerous cases\r\nbe overlooked in which travellers affected with choleraic diarrhoea\r\nhave disseminated the disease at great distances from their\r\nstarting-point, although unconscious of the nature of their own\r\nailment, whose seed they were sowing along their route.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Med.-Chir. Trans._, li. 1.]\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--Like the diseases called septic, of which the eruptive\r\nfevers may be taken as examples, and also like the effects of irritant\r\npoisons, the gravity of cholera must mainly depend upon the amount and\r\nthe activity of the specific poison that is received into the system.\r\nIt is most probable that the cholera poison is organic, and that it\r\nhas a limited power of reproduction and term of existence, a period\r\nalso of intense activity and a period of exhaustion; in a word, that\r\neither by progressive dilution as an inorganic substance or by organic\r\nsenescence it finally ceases to exist. By no other theory is it\r\npossible to explain the numerous degrees of severity which cholera\r\nexhibits, from a mild indisposition to a malignant and rapidly fatal\r\ndisease. On the one hand, the patients, if they may so be called, are\r\nhardly prevented from attending to their customary occupations. They\r\nmay even be able to travel and carry the disease to distant places,\r\nand so appear to justify the erroneous and irrational doctrine of the\r\natmospheric or spontaneous origin of cholera. On the other hand, the\r\nentire apparent duration of an attack may not exceed two or three\r\nhours, during which all the distinctive symptoms of the disease may be\r\ncrowded together in the most appalling forms. Such grave cases are\r\nalways most numerous at the commencement of an epidemic. These\r\nstatements are true not only in regard to individual cases in the\r\ngreater number of epidemics, but they represent the distinctive\r\ncharacter of particular epidemics, some of which are as remarkable for\r\ntheir benignity as others are for their extreme malignity. For such\r\ncontrasts no plausible reason can be suggested, unless it be a\r\ndifference either in the essential virulence of the morbid poison or\r\nin the dose of it imbibed. That they are due to the activity rather\r\nthan to the quantity of the poison seems to {754} be proved by the\r\nprogressive weakening in the gravity of the cases; for if the quantity\r\nof the poison remained the same some malignant cases might be expected\r\nto occur even during the decline of an epidemic.\r\n\r\nThese considerations help to explain the extreme diversities of\r\nmortality in different epidemics. The extremes may be stated at 10 and\r\n90 per cent., and they would perhaps be still wider apart if all the\r\nmild cases, which are never reported--many of which, indeed, do not\r\neven fall under medical observation--were included in the reckoning.\r\nThe general or average mortality of cholera is about 50 per cent.\r\nAccording to Allbu, the epidemics in Berlin from 1831 to 1873 gave a\r\ntotal of 28,753 cases and 18,916 deaths; that is, a mortality of 65.8\r\nper cent. (Eichhorst). It should be noted that, as in other epidemic\r\ndiseases, there is no uniform proportion between the extent and the\r\nmortality of cholera epidemics. Some of very limited extent have been\r\nproportionally the most destructive. It should also be remembered that\r\nthe disease is far more fatal in infancy and old age than at any other\r\nperiod of life, and for a similar reason it is very dangerous to all\r\nwho are weakened by any cause, such as an inherited morbid diathesis,\r\na chronic debilitating disease, etc. There seems to be a doubt whether\r\nits male or female victims are the more numerous. In this connection\r\nit may be suggested that while males are more likely to contract the\r\ndisease by drinking contaminated water, etc., more women are exposed\r\nto its contagion by their intimate relations with the sick, by their\r\nhandling and washing infected fomites, by carrying away the cholera\r\ndischarges, etc.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the class of society to which cholera patients belong is\r\nnot without influence on its prognosis. Not only is the total\r\nmortality greater among the laboring classes, but the individual\r\nbelonging to those classes has a less chance of recovery, because he\r\nis not apt to resort to treatment on the appearance of the premonitory\r\nsigns of the disease, and because the treatment he receives is less\r\nintelligently and sedulously pursued by his physicians and friends.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the particular symptoms which are favorable or\r\nunfavorable, nothing need be added to what has already been stated in\r\ndetail, unless it be that during the height of the attack the danger\r\nis to be measured by the degree of prostration and of the stasis of\r\nthe blood, and, during reaction, by the grade of the typhoid state.\r\nGradual reaction, as denoted by the state of the skin and the pulse\r\nand a more natural aspect of the stools, is generally indicative of\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nFinally, a word of caution may be given to those who are apt to\r\nattribute all the favorable changes in the conditions of an epidemic\r\nto the sanitary or medicinal measures they have instituted. Cholera\r\nepidemics are remarkable for the comparatively short period of their\r\nduration, which may be stated at less than a month in the same place.\r\nDoubtless, judicious sanitation and timely treatment save a great many\r\nlives, but the qualifying fact, already insisted upon, must not be\r\noverlooked, that the mortality occasioned by the disease in a given\r\nplace is greatest during the first period of its prevalence, and that\r\nthenceforth it gradually declines. Yet it is of essential significance\r\nthat the disease rarely attacks a large number of persons\r\nsimultaneously; the epidemic proper is usually preceded by a few\r\nscattering cases which are apt to become foci of ignition that\r\npresently unite to form a widespread conflagration. The recognition\r\n{755} of these cases, their isolation, and the proper treatment of the\r\nlocalities where they occurred have frequently stamped out what might\r\nhave been the commencement of a deadly epidemic.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.--The history of cholera demonstrates conclusively that\r\nsince the disease, outside of India, never arises spontaneously, it\r\nmust be more or less preventible, partly by excluding its seeds and\r\npartly by rendering the soil in which they are planted more or less\r\nunfit for their development; in other words, by quarantines and\r\nsanitary cordons and by various measures of local sanitation.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the former there would be comparatively little difference\r\nof opinion, at least theoretically, if both measures were alike\r\nefficacious. But there would seem to have prevailed a tendency in\r\nofficial quarters to undervalue the efficiency of both. Those who made\r\nand administered the sanitary laws relating to cholera seem to have\r\nforgotten the emphatic question, \"What will not a man give for his\r\nlife?\" or at least to have considered that whatever value some men may\r\nset upon their own lives, the lives of other men become of no account\r\nwhen balanced against the needs, or even the conveniences, of\r\ncommerce. The ethics which justified the introduction of opium into\r\nChina by the English and the American gift of alcohol to the Indian to\r\ngratify a lust for lucre or for land is only paralleled by those\r\ncontained in the official protests against cholera quarantines. At the\r\nInternational Medical Congress held in 1873 at Constantinople, it was\r\nalmost unanimously resolved that \"the practice of (land) quarantine as\r\nnow carried out ought not to be maintained, because, on the one hand,\r\nit does not constitute a real protection, and, on the other hand, _it\r\nis directly opposed to the interests of commerce and industry._\" A\r\nleading critic, in commenting upon this, remarks that if a quarantine\r\nwere possible it would give no real security, because it would be\r\nevaded, just as customs laws are evaded by smuggling.[58] A logical\r\ndeduction from this curious argument would be that customs laws should\r\nbe abrogated. In 1880 was published the report of the German Imperial\r\nCommission on the cholera epidemic of 1873 in Germany, edited by\r\nHirsch, from which we learn that \"all the German medical experts agree\r\nin condemning the employment of quarantine, for, while largely\r\ndetrimental to the _interests_, _welfare_, _convenience_, and\r\n_happiness_ of a community, it is _quite inert_ and _inefficient_ as a\r\nsafeguard against the further diffusion of cholera.\"[59] Whether this\r\nopinion refers only to land quarantine or not is left in doubt, but\r\nthe spirit of subordinating the lives of the people to the commercial\r\ninterests of a country is just the same as, and is not less worthy of\r\ncondemnation than, the spirit which has more than once blinded customs\r\nofficials to the disease on board of vessels from which it has\r\nafterward issued to destroy thousands of lives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Practitioner_, xii. 226.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Ibid._, xxvi. 159.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to be overlooked that in national as well as in personal\r\naffairs \"honesty is the best policy,\" and that if, instead of\r\nconcealment or false statements regarding the sanitary state of ships,\r\ntheir passengers, and cargoes, and equally false assertions respecting\r\nthe contagiousness of cholera, and a contemptuous neglect of\r\nwell-tried preventive measures,--if, instead of this delusive and\r\ndisastrous policy, all nations had honestly carried out the rules\r\nprescribed by experience for the exclusion of the disease, and for its\r\nmanagement after it had passed the frontiers of a country, {756} there\r\ncan be little doubt that its ravages would ere this have been confined\r\nto the region in which it originated. As we have seen, there is urged\r\nagainst the enforcement of a rigid quarantine by land or sea the\r\nsingular argument that it has not always excluded the disease. A more\r\nlogical inference would seem to be that since it succeeded, not\r\ncompletely, but yet partially, its inefficiency should be charged to\r\nits imperfect execution; or, even granting that the absolute exclusion\r\nof cholera is impracticable in every instance, including cases of\r\ncholeraic diarrhoea, contaminated clothing and merchandise, does it\r\ntherefore follow that the transit of men and things should be\r\nunimpeded? As well might it be maintained that because one or more\r\nhouses cannot escape destruction by fire, therefore no effort should\r\nbe made to save the remainder of a threatened city; as well might it\r\nbe argued that because some men must be killed in battle, no\r\nprecautions should therefore be used to preserve the rest of the army;\r\nas well abstain from all local sanitation intended to mitigate the\r\nravages of the disease, because, do what we may, some victims it will\r\nsurely have. This is taking counsel from despair; is a stupid fatalism\r\nwhich one might imagine to have been imported with the disease from\r\nthe East; or it may be a sign of the unconscious blindness of\r\nMammon-worshippers, who, neither fearing God nor regarding man, have\r\nas little pity for the victims of cholera, permitted, if not invited,\r\nby them to scourge the nations, as devout Christians once felt for the\r\nnegroes who were bought or kidnapped in Africa to toil and die under\r\nthe lash of the slave-driver.\r\n\r\nProbably no sanitary cordon nor any quarantine will invariably and\r\ncompletely exclude cholera, since it is transmissible by living men\r\nand by water and by fomites of various descriptions, and, worst of\r\nall, by men who neither exhibit its characteristic symptoms nor are\r\nconscious of the poison which they conceal and disseminate. But, as\r\nhas already been urged, it is no argument against preventive measures\r\nthat they are not absolutely perfect in their efficiency. If they\r\nsometimes succeed in arresting the progress of cholera, and if they\r\nalways, when honestly executed, lessen the number of channels through\r\nwhich the infection can be conveyed, and thereby reduce to a minimum\r\nits fatal effects, they ought to be maintained and perfected, and not\r\ndecried or abolished. It is difficult to characterize that state of\r\nmind which concludes against the use of a salutary measure because its\r\nefficiency is not absolute, the more so when it is admitted that its\r\ninefficiency is not intrinsic, but due to negligent, and even\r\nfraudulent, administration. The preponderance of official and personal\r\nauthority is altogether on the side of the necessity of a quarantine,\r\nnot in its literal, but in its technical, sense. The International\r\nMedical Congress of 1874 declared as follows: \"Quarantine ought to be\r\nlimited to the time requisite for the examination and disinfection of\r\nthe ship, the crew, and the passengers; and if there be no disease on\r\nboard the latter should be released immediately after disinfection.\r\nBut if there be cholera or sickness of a doubtful nature on board, it\r\nwill be necessary to isolate and disinfect the ship also.\" The same\r\ncongress, however, wholly condemned land quarantines, apparently upon\r\nthe sole ground of the extreme difficulty of rendering them\r\nefficient--an argument, as before remarked, that touches not the\r\nprinciple of the measure, but only the manner of its execution. In\r\nthis respect the congress occupied a lower position than its\r\npredecessor of 1866, which held that the futility of {757} quarantine\r\nin \"arresting the march of cholera\" arose \"rather from the\r\nunintelligent application of the measure than from any fallacy in its\r\nprinciple.\"[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Practitioner_, xxviii. 393.]\r\n\r\nIt would burden this narrative even to enumerate the instances in\r\nwhich a strict quarantine has protected places to which cholera has\r\nbeen carried by sea. In the United States numerous examples might be\r\ngiven of seaports into which cholera was brought from foreign\r\ncountries, and within whose quarantine stations it was confined by\r\nrigid sanitary regulations; but it is sufficient to cite the case of\r\nNew York, through whose quarantine at Staten Island nine-tenths of all\r\nemigrants to America have passed. Writing in 1867, Dr. Peters said:\r\n\"There have been fourteen epidemics of cholera at Staten Island, and\r\nonly four have reached New York.\" A large number of illustrations has\r\nbeen collected by Dr. Smart, Inspector-General, R. N.,[61] who sums up\r\nthe matter as follows: \"Believing that cholera has frequently been\r\nexcluded from islands by quarantine, and as often introduced by its\r\nnon-observance, I regard it as a truly preventive measure; but,\r\nrecognizing the impracticability of exacting it under many\r\ncircumstances, I would insist on the most strict isolation of all the\r\nfirst cases or units of disease, whether introduced from without or\r\noriginating from relationship to introduced cases, or persons or goods\r\nimported from infected countries.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Lancet_, April, 1873, pp. 555, 659; _Times and\r\nGazette_, April, 1874, p. 387. Compare also Colin, _Brit. and For.\r\nMed.-Chir. Rev._, July, 1874, pp. 42-44.]\r\n\r\nWhile experience demonstrates the efficacy, and therefore the\r\nnecessity, of quarantine against cholera in seaports, it has also\r\nshown that the same agent of prevention need not be invariably and\r\nrigidly applied. When quarantine meant literally a detention, and\r\nalmost an incarceration, for forty days, it often failed through its\r\nvery rigor at a time when proper methods of disinfecting ships,\r\ncargoes, crews, and passengers were either unknown or inefficiently\r\napplied. It is now certain that quarantine may be reduced to a\r\nfraction of its original duration, and yet possess a much greater\r\ndegree of efficiency, its length depending upon the number and the\r\nsanitary condition of the crew, etc., the nature of the cargo, etc. It\r\nis evident that a ship carrying only cabin passengers is less open to\r\nsuspicion than one crowded with filthy emigrants, although both may\r\nhave sailed from the same cholera-infected port. A more liberal rule\r\nmay govern the one than the other; and in the second case a rigid\r\ninspection and cleansing of luggage may be imperative which would be\r\nsuperfluous as well as vexatious in the first case. The importance of\r\nsuch a treatment of emigrants' effects has already been illustrated by\r\ncases in which they caused an outbreak of cholera after having been\r\ncarried from a seaport into an interior town many hundreds of miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the time during which a vessel that has had cholera on\r\nboard within a week or ten days should be detained under sanitary\r\ninspection and treatment, including a thorough cleansing of the\r\npassengers and their effects, no absolute rule can be laid down; but\r\nit would appear that if no suspicious cases arise within a week, there\r\nneed be little apprehension that any will occur.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary measures which should be undertaken wherever there is\r\nreason to fear an invasion of cholera are, in the first place, such as\r\nare {758} equally appropriate in anticipation of any infectious and\r\ncontagious epidemic disease, and relate especially to the removal of\r\nall sources of putrid emanations, whether in stagnant ponds, in\r\nstreets, markets, shambles, sewers, privies, cellars, or inhabited\r\nrooms; for these influences, although they do not cause cholera, yet,\r\nby lowering the vitality of persons exposed to them, create an\r\nabnormal susceptibility to disease. Many instances in Europe might be\r\ncited to prove that whole cities, which in the earlier epidemics were\r\ndevastated by cholera, were either spared entirely in the later ones\r\nor suffered in a far less degree. The measures which proved most\r\nefficient were an improved water-supply and a better system of\r\nsewerage; and this fact strongly corroborates the belief that\r\ncontaminated water and fecal emanations are the principal agents in\r\npropagating this disease. Cleanliness is the best disinfectant, but\r\nduring epidemics of cholera, as of other diseases, the popular faith\r\nis very strong in numerous articles called by that name. The real\r\nvalue of these preparations is commercial rather than sanitary, but,\r\nindirectly, they are useful by prompting those who use them to be more\r\ndiligent in searching out and removing many sources of\r\nair-contamination that perhaps invite and intensify attacks of\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\nThe disinfectants in common use comprise chlorine gas, chlorinated\r\nsoda, chloride of zinc, sulphate of iron, permanganate of potassium,\r\ncarbolic acid, and the fumes of burning sulphur. Some of them--and\r\nespecially the chloride of zinc, sulphate of iron, the permanganate of\r\npotassium, and carbolic acid--are supposed to be capable of destroying\r\nthe infectious principle of the vomit and stools. Another method is to\r\nreceive such matters in vessels containing saw-dust, which, after\r\nbeing dried, is consumed by fire; and still another is to mix them\r\nwith dry earth and bury them. If they are thrown into water-closets or\r\nprivies, they should have added to them a portion of sulphate of iron.\r\nWhatever has been used by cholera patients should be destroyed, unless\r\nof value, and in that case it should be thoroughly purified by hot air\r\nor boiling water and long exposure to the sun. The importance of\r\nhaving large and well-ventilated rooms for cholera patients is very\r\ngreat, but less, perhaps, for the patients themselves than for their\r\nmedical attendants and nurses. All persons should be excluded from\r\nthem who are not required by the duties of the sick chamber, and in\r\ncase of death funeral assemblages ought not to be allowed; nor, during\r\na cholera epidemic, ought crowded assemblies for any purpose to be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nDuring epidemics of cholera, as of some other diseases, the liability\r\nto be attacked is greatest when the vital powers are depressed by\r\nmental or by physical causes. Hence it is desirable that one's courage\r\nand confidence should repose upon a consciousness of having done\r\nwhatever is recognized as proper to ward off the disease--not by a\r\nminute, watchful, and anxious attention to rules at every step, but by\r\nsuch a general care of the health as good sense and experience enjoin.\r\nUndoubtedly, other things being equal, the weak, sickly, careless, and\r\nimprudent are more liable to suffer than the strong and cautious, and\r\ntherefore it is incumbent upon all to maintain as high a degree of\r\nhealth as possible, avoiding not only all probable sources of\r\ncontagion, direct or indirect, but excessive fatigue, catching cold,\r\ndepressing emotions, sexual excesses, etc. During the first cholera\r\nepidemics in this country it was considered so dangerous {759} to eat\r\nfruit and fresh vegetables that many persons lived entirely upon meat,\r\nrice, and bread. Such a regimen intensified choleraphobia, and was\r\nalso an unsuitable midsummer diet. There is no reason to believe that\r\nany intrinsically wholesome food need be prohibited during the\r\nprevalence of cholera.\r\n\r\nThe one article of diet about which the greatest and most peculiar\r\ncare should be taken is water. It is the first duty of towns supplied\r\nwith water from a common source to be sure that it is, and continues\r\nto be, uncontaminated. Well-water should be used as little as possible\r\nafter the disease has made its appearance, and, as an additional\r\nprecaution, no water should be drunken that has not previously been\r\nboiled. Where ice can be procured it may be used to restore the boiled\r\nwater to an agreeable temperature for drinking. Filtered water,\r\nprovided that it be properly filtered, may likewise be regarded as\r\ninnocuous.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--If regard be had to the various methods and particular\r\nmedicines which have been used in the treatment of cholera, it will\r\nappear that in hardly any other acute disease has a greater number or\r\nvariety been employed. If, on the other hand, we endeavor to learn\r\nwhat measures have been really and generally curative in cholera, and\r\nwhat are they to which, on the occurrence of an epidemic of the\r\ndisease, we may turn with confidence in their power to cure, the\r\nresult of the investigation is disheartening, and adds to the\r\naccumulated proofs that the power of medical art is exceedingly\r\nrestricted. To this conclusion we must assent at whatever cost to a\r\nfaith which is strong in proportion to the ignorance out of which it\r\ngrows. Nor, if we consider the matter rationally, ought we to be\r\nsurprised or humiliated on account of the comparative helplessness of\r\nmedicine in this disease, since, if we reflect upon it, the case is by\r\nno means peculiar or exceptional. Every disease that may become mortal\r\noccurs more or less frequently with phenomena which place it beyond\r\nthe resources of therapeutics as completely as cholera is in its most\r\nmalignant forms; and yet no one lays it to the charge of medicine that\r\nthe various fevers, for example, are at times utterly uninfluenced by\r\nthe most rational and judicious treatment. Nor does any one bring a\r\nrailing accusation against medicine when accident fatally damages a\r\npart essential to life.\r\n\r\nOne accident of frequent occurrence presents a certain analogy to\r\ncholera in its effects, and that is a burn or scald involving a very\r\nlarge portion of the skin. In cases of this sort experience assures us\r\nthat death is almost inevitable, and that the duty of the physician is\r\nto avoid officious and meddlesome treatment, and address himself to\r\nsoothe the patient's suffering and maintain his strength, if haply the\r\npowers of nature may triumph over the effects of the injury. This,\r\ntoo, is the lesson, substantially, which experience has taught\r\nrespecting cholera. It is certain that in this disease the function of\r\nthe whole gastro-intestinal mucous membrane is reversed, and that it\r\nis no longer a secreting and absorbing organ, but one almost\r\nexclusively exhaling, and that through it the liquid which is\r\nessential to carrying on the functions is rapidly running away. If the\r\nlesion on which this symptom depends is complete, if the\r\ngastro-intestinal mucous membrane has entirely lost its natural\r\nfunction, evidently it is quite futile to address any treatment to\r\nthis organ. But if, as probably happens in a great majority of the\r\ncases, the {760} disorganization takes place gradually, it is evident\r\nthat there is more to hope from remedies when the disease is gradually\r\ndeveloped than when it reaches its acme at a single bound and leaves\r\nno time for medical intervention. The one unmistakable lesson that\r\nexperience teaches respecting the treatment of cholera is, that its\r\nsuccess depends upon its prompt and early application. Almost as\r\ndistinctly does observation teach that subsequently to the first (or\r\ndiarrhoeal) stage the comparative value of different methods and\r\nindividual medicines is very uncertain. And, finally, it would seem\r\nthat in this, as in other acute diseases, intelligent and careful\r\nnursing and regimen are quite as important as any medicinal treatment\r\nwhatever. However a false notion of the power of medicine may blind us\r\nto the fact, it is none the less a fact, that if different methods of\r\ntreatment are compared, that method gives the best results which is\r\nleast perturbative. For example, in England, on board of a hospital\r\nship, were 85 cases, of which 19 treated by quinine gave 12 deaths, 12\r\nby calomel gave 2 deaths, 12 by carbolic acid gave 3 deaths, and 37 by\r\n\"Nil\" gave 1 death.[62] Or, again, in 1865, at the London Hospital,\r\n159 patients were treated--48 with a mixture containing logwood,\r\nether, aromatic sulphuric acid, camphor, and capsicum, of whom 31\r\ndied; 56 with sweetened water, of whom 28 died; 21 with castor oil, of\r\nwhom 14 died; and 20 with \"saline lemonade,\" of whom 6 died.[63] In\r\nthe last example the deaths during the use of the astringent mixture\r\nwere twice as great as under sugar and water, and under castor oil\r\ntwice as great as under \"saline lemonade.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Times and Gaz._, Dec., 1866, p. 590.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _London Hosp. Reports_, iii. 444.]\r\n\r\nWe shall first give an account of the management of cholera in\r\ngeneral, and then consider some of the particular medicines used in\r\nits treatment.\r\n\r\nThe essential elements of all plans of treatment for this disease, as\r\nfor so many others, are rest and abstinence. Whatever else may be\r\ndone, nothing avails without them. This remark applies emphatically to\r\nthe premonitory diarrhoea; if it is neglected it may readily be\r\nconverted into the full-formed disease. It is therefore essential,\r\nduring the prevalence of cholera, that whoever is attacked with\r\ndiarrhoea should at once give up all active occupation, and confine\r\nhimself to a recumbent posture and to the use of food of the blandest\r\nquality, such as mucilages and similar preparations, especially of\r\nrice, which, less than any other vegetable food, is liable to\r\nfermentation during digestion. It is prudent to drink no water that\r\nhas not been boiled. If there is reason to believe that the bowels\r\nretain feces from before the attack, it is generally thought advisable\r\nto administer a laxative dose of castor oil, to procure the discharge\r\nof matters which would act as irritants. Except for this purpose\r\npurgatives are neither indicated nor expedient. In a large number of\r\ncases nothing more is necessary than the use of means to check the\r\naction of the bowels, and which should consist of absorbents or\r\nantacids, astringents, and opiates as they are contained in the\r\nofficinal chalk mixture, with the addition of tincture of kino or\r\ncatechu and a small proportion of laudanum. This medicine should be\r\ngiven in dessertspoonful doses at intervals of not more than an hour.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of a diarrhoea which differs from ordinary dyspeptic\r\ndiarrhoea chiefly by its watery character, there should also be colic\r\nand profuse discharges, it is proper to add to the medicines just\r\nsuggested some which are of a decidedly stimulant character, such as\r\nthe essential oils of {761} cajeput, cloves, cinnamon, peppermint,\r\netc., with which chloroform, ether, or Hoffman's anodyne may be\r\nassociated. At the same time rubefacient embrocations may be applied\r\nto the abdomen, which should also be compressed slightly with a broad\r\nflannel bandage. Instead of these stimulants, and perhaps more\r\nefficiently, may be used a simple epithem made by dipping a large\r\ntowel several times folded in cold or cool water, applying it so as to\r\ncover the whole abdomen, and then enveloping it and the body with a\r\ndry towel. This application is more soothing than any liniment and its\r\naction is more constant. Instead of any of these agents dry heat may\r\nbe used, obtained from bags of hot salt or sand, or moist heat from\r\nthick poultices of flaxseed meal or Indian corn meal or similar\r\nsubstances enclosed in flannel bags and applied to the abdomen while\r\nthey are as hot as can be borne. It is difficult to determine which of\r\nthese applications is the most useful. But, on the whole, heat is\r\npreferable to rubefacients, and moist to dry heat. The cold-water\r\ndressing is probably best suited to young and robust persons.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that between choleraic diarrhoea and cholera in\r\nits complete form there are several grades, in one of the most common\r\nof which a tendency to vomit, and even a certain amount of vomiting,\r\naccompanies the diarrhoea. Anti-emetic remedies are then indicated.\r\nThey may consist externally of rubefacient and aromatic applications\r\nto the epigastrium (especially the spice poultice); and it is claimed\r\nthat a hypodermic injection of morphia in this part is very efficient.\r\nInternally, the best remedies are ice swallowed in small pieces and\r\nsmall but frequent draughts of iced carbonated water or iced\r\nchampagne. Where these liquids cannot be procured, effervescing\r\npowders used in the same way form a very good substitute for them. If,\r\nnotwithstanding such remedies, the diarrhoea continues or if it tends\r\nto increase, astringent and absorbent medicines may be substituted for\r\nthem; for example, bismuth may be given instead of chalk, and if this\r\nalso fails acetate of lead may be prescribed. The last may be used by\r\nthe rectum as well as by the mouth, but with very questionable\r\nadvantage. Meanwhile, especial care should be taken to avoid giving so\r\nmuch of any opiate as will induce sopor or excite nausea.\r\n\r\nWhoever has had the care of cholera patients has probably, at first,\r\nfelt sanguine of success in their treatment, even after the\r\ncharacteristic discharges and the symptoms of collapse had set in; but\r\na little more experience has proved their hope to be deceptive, and\r\nrevealed the reason of it in the absolute suspension of the\r\nsensibility and absorbent function of the digestive canal. Hence the\r\ndismal unanimity of all medical authors, who from actual observation\r\nof cholera have declared that no treatment avails to arrest the\r\nfully-developed disease. And yet there is some encouragement in the\r\nfact that recoveries sometimes occur from even the most desperate\r\nstate of collapse and under the most dissimilar methods of treatment;\r\nso that the physician is warranted in not yielding to discouragement\r\nand in cheering his patients with hope even to the end of life. The\r\npopular dread of this, and indeed of all epidemics, is sure to be\r\nexaggerated, and it therefore behooves the physician to combat the\r\nfears of his patients, and by a cheerful manner as well as encouraging\r\nwords administer the cordial of hope, which often proves stronger than\r\npharmaceutic elixirs.\r\n\r\n{762} It may be well to enumerate, as many do, the indications of\r\ntreatment in the active stage of cholera, but they really need no such\r\nspecification. It is evident that they consist in combating the\r\nsymptoms--the vomiting, the purging, the debility, the cyanosis, the\r\ncramps, etc.; and the only means by which the carrying out of such\r\nindications can even be attempted are neither more nor less than would\r\nbe used to relieve the same symptoms in other affections. If the\r\nevacuations could be controlled, evidently the cramps and the collapse\r\nwould not occur; but this essential and preliminary step cannot be\r\nsecured. The medicines introduced into the stomach or rectum are not\r\nabsorbed, but are speedily rejected; those which are administered\r\nsubcutaneously are not taken up by the stagnant blood as freely as in\r\nother diseases; the nervous system gives little or no response to the\r\nmechanical and physiological stimulants applied to the skin. Yet, in\r\nspite of these obstacles, the physician must persist in the use of\r\nrational methods, in the hope, however faint it may be, that he may\r\nsucceed in restraining, and possibly in arresting, the fatal course of\r\nthe attack. For this end he has hardly any means at command except\r\nthose, or such as those, which were recommended in the first stage of\r\nthe disease--the anti-emetic and anti-diarrhoeal medicines, which he\r\nis only too likely to see rejected as soon as administered. Yet he\r\nmust not cease to allay the thirst by the repeated administration of\r\nsmall quantities of carbonated and cold liquids, water, or champagne\r\nwine, or morsels of ice swallowed whole. The application of pounded\r\nice in a bladder to the epigastrium is a measure of an analogous sort,\r\nand is sometimes as efficient as generally it is soothing. In other\r\ncases the aromatic poultice seems to answer better. Of irritants\r\nlittle can be said that is favorable, but the combined irritant and\r\nanæsthetic action of chloroform is useful, and morphia should be\r\napplied to the epigastrium as well as given hypodermically.\r\n\r\nIf the vomiting tends to become less frequent, acetate of lead may be\r\nprescribed, in the hope that it will exert some constringing action\r\nupon the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane. The distressing symptom,\r\nhiccough, cannot with any certainty be controlled by medicine, but\r\nperhaps the inhalation of chloroform is more efficient than any other\r\nremedy, as it also is for the cramps in the limbs. For the latter\r\npurpose it is preferable to the frictions with flannel or with\r\nstimulating liniments which are generally employed. If such liniments\r\nare used, care should be taken that they do not contain ingredients\r\nthat may disorganize the skin either immediately or subsequently. A\r\ndangerous compound of the latter sort introduced during the first\r\nepidemic of cholera in this country became officinal under the name of\r\nliniment of cantharides.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the water and of the salts it holds in solution in the\r\nblood is, as has now been frequently repeated, the chief pathological\r\nelement of the disease, next after the conjectural cause which injures\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels. It was rationally\r\nindicated, and therefore a method was early practised, to supply this\r\nloss by injecting into the veins a solution of sodium salts. The\r\nmethod was seductive as well as rational, for its primary effects were\r\nextremely encouraging; it nevertheless failed, and probably for the\r\nvery reason that suggested its use. Indeed, there is no more reason,\r\nif there is as much, to suppose that a liquid artificially introduced\r\ninto the blood-vessels will be retained when {763} the natural liquor\r\nsanguinis cannot be so. Necessarily, the one will escape where the\r\nother has escaped.\r\n\r\nCertain systematic writers prescribe a method intended, on the one\r\nhand, for reviving the animal heat, and on the other for restoring the\r\nmovement of the circulation. It need hardly be remarked that the two\r\nform essentially but one and the same indication. If the circulation\r\nis restored the animal heat will revive, but not otherwise. The same\r\ntreatment leads to both ends, and it consists partly, as already\r\nstated, in the use of stimulants, such as alcohol, camphor, coffee,\r\nether, etc.; but their efficacy depends upon their being taken into\r\nthe blood, and with it reaching the various nervous centres upon which\r\nthe renewal of functional activity depends. Little, therefore, can be\r\nexpected from them at the height of the disease--that is, in the stage\r\nof collapse--but as soon as any signs of reaction are manifested they\r\ntend to promote it, and hence may enable the functions to revive. For\r\nthis reason they are adapted to persons who are feeble by reason of\r\ntheir tender or their advanced age, or who have previously suffered\r\nfrom ill-health. But if they act at all, and the more they tend to\r\nact, they must be employed with circumspection, lest they outrun the\r\npurpose of their administration and produce a violent or excessive\r\nreaction. Instead of, or in conjunction with, these internal remedies\r\nthe local stimulants of the skin, already enumerated, may be used with\r\nthe due precautions, and, in addition, baths at a temperature of 105°\r\nF. of water alone or with the addition of salt or mustard; but all\r\nsuch remedies are of little avail until reaction has commenced. Before\r\nthat event there is reason to believe that the cold bath is\r\npreferable, or, still better, frictions of the whole body with cold\r\nwater, or even with ice, after which the patient should be wrapped in\r\ndry and warm blankets. Yet the efficacy of this powerful agency is by\r\nno means comparable to that which it produces in the algid forms of\r\nmalarial fever. The two conditions, although apparently analogous,\r\nare, in reality, very different. In the cold stage of fever the\r\nmechanism is indeed paralyzed, but none of its mechanical elements are\r\nwanting; but in algid cholera there is an actual subtraction of water\r\nfrom the blood, that turns it from a liquid capable of circulating\r\nthrough the narrowest channels into one that stagnates even in the\r\nlargest vessels. In the one case force is wanting to circulate the\r\nblood; in the other there is no normal blood to circulate.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the stage of reaction when it does not exceed a\r\nmoderate degree, consists simply in strictly enforcing the rules for\r\nthe patient's repose; that is to say, in intelligent nursing. Mental\r\nexcitement must be forbidden, and neither medicine nor food allowed\r\nthat is likely to interfere with the gradual and steady progress of\r\nconvalescence. Of all articles of food, cool water is not only the\r\nmost urgently desired, but is the most imperatively necessary for\r\nreplenishing the emptied blood-vessels and restoring the normal\r\nfunctions. But unless great caution is observed it will be taken too\r\nfreely and provoke a renewal of the discharges. If any food besides\r\nwater is allowed, it should be of the simplest sort--of whey first,\r\nand then of milk in small quantities at a time, with lime-water if it\r\nprovokes nausea or retching. Afterward thin broths may be given, also\r\nin great moderation, and by degrees farinacea in milk and in animal\r\nbroths. Only when the strength is much improved should even the most\r\n{764} digestible meats be permitted. In proportion as convalescence is\r\nmarked or interrupted by symptoms of undue reaction is it necessary to\r\nprolong and render stringent this regimen; and if those symptoms\r\nunfortunately arise which oftener, perhaps, depend upon an\r\nover-zealous stimulant treatment than upon the natural reaction of the\r\nsystem, they must be combated by measures which will lessen the local\r\ncongestions, especially of the brain and the lungs, and also by such\r\nas will tend to prevent the system from falling into a typhoid state.\r\nFor the former dry cups applied to the back of the neck, and cold\r\nlotions and affusions upon the scalp, are to be recommended, and for\r\nthe latter dry cups and warm stimulating poultices upon the chest near\r\nthe affected region. It is probable that the general warm bath, with\r\ncold affusion upon the head at the same time, would prove as efficient\r\nas it does in analogous states of typhoid affections. If the urinary\r\nsecretion is suspended or remains scanty, there is not usually an\r\nurgent need of using means for its restoration; for that will\r\ngenerally occur when the blood-vessels become replenished. It should,\r\nhowever, be mentioned that, according to Macnamara, if the patient\r\ndoes not pass any urine within thirty-six hours of reaction coming on,\r\nten minims of the tincture of cantharides in an ounce of water should\r\nbe given every half hour until six doses have been taken, and the\r\npatient encouraged to drink freely of water. If this treatment does\r\nnot cause urine to pass, we must, after the sixth dose, discontinue\r\nthe medicine for twelve hours, and then repeat it in precisely the\r\nsame way. The dose here referred to is of the British preparation, and\r\nif the use of it were not recommended by so competent an authority its\r\npropriety might very properly be challenged.\r\n\r\nAfter the cholera patient has become convalescent his restoration is\r\nvery apt to be retarded by dyspeptic disorders, for which, perhaps,\r\nthe best remedy is a judicious use of condiments with the food and of\r\nbitter tonics, especially quinine, colombo, quassia, etc., before\r\nmeals. If there is constipation, it should be corrected by the\r\ncautious use of fruits, and, if these prove insufficient, of mild\r\nsaline laxatives or small doses of castor oil or rhubarb. On the other\r\nhand, if there is a tendency to diarrhoea, it should be met by the use\r\nof a mild laxative, such as castor oil, magnesia, or rhubarb, followed\r\nby chalk or bismuth, and the use for a time of simpler food and in\r\nless than the usual quantities.\r\n\r\nHaving thus furnished a sketch of the plan of treatment of cholera\r\nwhich we regard as dictated by experience, it may be not without some\r\ninterest to consider certain elements of the method a little more\r\nfully, and criticise, in passing, some other remedies which have from\r\ntime to time been proposed. The first of these is venesection. There\r\nwas a time when certain physicians, carried away by conceptions of the\r\ndisease evolved from their inner consciousness, maintained that it\r\nconsisted essentially of a spasm of the blood-vessels, and that the\r\nnatural and legitimate cure for it was to be found in bleeding. No\r\ntheory is so gratuitous or absurd but cases may be found which appear\r\nto justify it, and in this instance also examples were not wanting to\r\nillustrate at once the truth of the theory and its successful\r\napplication. Longer experience, however, and a more correct conception\r\nof the disease, have long since condemned this method, which was\r\nalmost as dangerous as it was irrational. If any additional argument\r\nagainst it were required, it would be found in the condition of the\r\nlungs after death. These organs, we have seen, are not {765} only not\r\nengorged, but they are empty of blood, and death is due not to\r\nasphyxia, but to apnoea, when it takes place in collapse.\r\n\r\nIf ever there existed any reason for the administration of an\r\nemetic--and ipecacuanha has generally been used at the commencement of\r\nan attack of cholera--it must be looked for, not in any clinical\r\nexperience of its virtues, but simply in the deplorable routine that\r\nrequired the administration of an emetic at the commencement of nearly\r\nall acute diseases, so that, whatever else was prescribed, the lancet\r\nand an emetic seldom failed to be so. In this case also the proofs of\r\nthe successful administration of ipecacuanha were not wanting, and one\r\nmight be tempted to suppose, in view of the alleged facts in its\r\nfavor, that it was useful by causing an evacuation of the material\r\ncause of the disease. Physicians were even to be found, of high\r\nstation and character, who contended that cholera is a species of\r\nfever, and to be treated by an emeto-cathartic composed of tartar\r\nemetic and epsom salts. If the treatment had been efficient, the\r\nabsurdity of the reasons for it might have been overlooked; but the\r\none was as disastrous as the other was false. But, as usual, the facts\r\nhad been misstated or misinterpreted, and emetics ceased to form a\r\npart of the systematic treatment of cholera. The idea which possessed\r\nthose who advocated the use of evacuants was that there was either a\r\npoison to be eliminated from the blood or one to be expelled from the\r\nbowels. Apparently, the method was not efficacious, for the latest\r\nphase of it, the use of castor oil in acute stage of cholera, was of\r\nshort duration.\r\n\r\nWhen cholera first appeared in Europe the tendency naturally arose to\r\nfollow in its treatment the example of the British practitioners in\r\nIndia. It then appeared that one of the most eminent among them,\r\nAnnesley, gave a scruple of calomel, with two grains of opium, at the\r\ncommencement of the attack, and repeated the dose in six or eight\r\nhours, and again upon the following day. In the decline of the disease\r\nhe ordered scruple doses of calomel for the removal of a\r\n\"cream-colored, thick, viscid, and tenacious matter exactly like old\r\ncream cheese, which glues the gut together and obstructs its passage.\"\r\nThree, four, and even five, scruples of calomel were usually taken\r\nbefore this effect was produced. When it is added that this\r\npractitioner held depletion to be the capital element of the\r\ntreatment, and that he was equally lavish of his patient's blood and\r\nof his own drugs, we can only wonder that any subjects of his heroic\r\nmethod survived. It is now conceded by all enlightened physicians that\r\nmercurials in large or in ordinary doses are worse than worthless in\r\nepidemic cholera. In 1832, Dr. Ayre of Hull, Eng., proposed another\r\nmethod of using calomel, to which he adhered in treating this disease.\r\nIt consisted in the administration of very small doses of calomel at\r\nshort intervals, and with each of the first doses a few drops of\r\nlaudanum. Such a method, if not carried too far, certainly has the\r\nmerit of sparing the patient a great deal of the perturbative\r\ntreatment against which we have, in the preceding pages, protested.\r\nBut that was not at all the notion of its proposer. He claimed for it\r\npositive and active virtues. He stated, as the fundamental ground of\r\nhis plan, that \"the primary and leading object of the treatment must\r\nbe to restore the secretion of the liver.\" He did not in the least\r\ndoubt that he was able to do this by the administration of\r\nmercury--not, indeed, by a direct action upon the liver {766} itself,\r\nbut indirectly and sympathetically through the stomach, and by the\r\nhealthy and specific stimulus imparted to it, by which the due\r\nsecretion of the bile is promoted. It is, indeed, difficult to\r\nconceive of any stimulus that calomel could impart to the stomach that\r\nwould not be equally given by any other non-irritant and insoluble\r\npowder--subnitrate of bismuth, for example. Indeed, Ayre himself\r\nrelates the case of a man who in an attack of cholera took during\r\nthree days no less than five hundred and eighty grains of calomel, and\r\nrecovered without any soreness of the mouth. But the plan which he\r\nfinally elaborated was different. It was to give small doses of\r\ncalomel repeatedly--in the premonitory stage one grain every half hour\r\nor hour for six or eight successive times, or, if this failed, every\r\nfive or ten minutes--and in the stage of collapse one grain and a half\r\nevery five minutes. In a few cases of extreme severity two grains of\r\ncalomel were given every five minutes for an hour or two, and then the\r\nordinary dose of one grain was resumed. But this was not all: with\r\nevery dose of calomel was associated one, two, or three drops of\r\nlaudanum, so that if these doses were repeated frequently the patient\r\nreceived a very efficient amount of the narcotic during the attack.\r\nIndeed, Ayre attributed to it the virtue of sustaining the vital\r\npowers under the depressing influence of the disease, and of removing\r\nor abating the cramps, as well as of detaining the calomel in the\r\nstomach.[64] From the preceding account it follows that the treatment\r\nof cholera by small doses of calomel with laudanum is founded on an\r\nerroneous assumption of the mode of action of calomel, and that\r\nwhatever efficacy the plan of treatment may possess may with more\r\njustice be attributed to the opium, whose effects we know, than to the\r\ncalomel, whose action, so far as it is known at all, has no\r\nconceivable relation to the disease for which it was given. However\r\nthis may be, if the results of Ayre's treatment are compared with\r\nthose of other plans, it exhibits very little if any superiority. In\r\nthe report of the cholera committee of the College of Physicians,\r\nLondon, made in 1853, we find the statement that in 725 unequivocal\r\ncases treated on Ayre's plan the deaths were 365, or about 50 per\r\ncent., and also the following commentary: \"In general, no appreciable\r\neffects followed the administration of calomel, even after a large\r\namount in small and frequently-repeated doses had been administered.\r\nFor the most part, it was quickly evacuated by vomiting or purging,\r\nor, when retained for a longer period, was passed from the bowels\r\nunchanged. Salivation but very rarely occurred, and then only in the\r\nmilder cases. We conclude that calomel was inert when administered in\r\ncollapse, and that the cases of recovery following its employment at\r\nthis period were due to the natural course of the disease, as they did\r\nnot surpass the ordinary average obtained when the treatment consisted\r\nin the use of cold water only.\"[65] It is of interest to compare the\r\nmortality of 50 per cent. above stated to have occurred under this\r\nsort of calomel treatment with the mortality noted at the London\r\nHospital under various kinds of treatment, including the\r\nadministration of calomel in doses varying \"from five to ten and\r\ntwenty grains every quarter, half, one hour, two, four, etc.\" Out of\r\n509 cases, 281 were fatal, or 54.9 per cent.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _A Report on the Treatment of the Malignant Cholera_,\r\nLond., 1833.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Dr. Gull's _Report_, p. 177.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _Lond. Hosp. Reports_, iii. 437, 441.]\r\n\r\nEvery disease in which exhaustion and coldness occur is sure to be\r\n{767} treated more or less actively with alcohol, but in the collapse\r\nof cholera, as in the cold stage of fevers, it is generally useless,\r\nand sometimes hurtful. We believe that the following protest of\r\nMacnamara is sustained by almost universal experience: \"I would here\r\nenter an earnest protest against the use of brandy or any alcoholic\r\nstimulant in this [the second] stage of cholera. I believe these, both\r\ntheoretically and practically, to be the cause of unmitigated evil. I\r\nsimply, therefore, mention brandy, champagne, and the like in order to\r\ncondemn their use most emphatically in cholera; according to my ideas\r\nand experience, it is almost impossible to hit on a more detrimental\r\nplan of treatment than that usually known as 'the stimulant' in this\r\nform of disease.\"[67] It is true that apparent dissidents from this\r\njudgment may be found, like Playfair, a deputy inspector of hospitals\r\nin Bengal, who even circulated printed directions for the treatment of\r\nthe first stage of the disease by means of brandy or strong rum,\r\ncayenne pepper, and laudanum, and had entire confidence in the\r\nefficacy of the method.[68] Dr. Macpherson, inspector-general of\r\nhospitals, also, after comparing the results of a stimulant treatment\r\nwith those of other methods, reaches the conclusion that the\r\nmortality-rate of cholera is affected neither by the moderate nor by\r\nthe excessive use of alcohol.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Op. cit._, p. 456.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Edinburgh Med. Jour._, xix. 471.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Med. Times and Gaz._, Jan., 1870, p. 62.]\r\n\r\nUpon no other point in the treatment of cholera is the agreement of\r\nphysicians more complete than upon the use of opiates in the early\r\nstage of the disease. The premonitory diarrhoea has always been\r\ntreated by opiates alone or associated with astringents. Probably the\r\nbest rule is to give from twenty to thirty drops of laudanum, or an\r\nequivalent dose of some other liquid preparation of opium, in a little\r\nbrandy and water, and repeat the dose as often as a stool is voided.\r\nOpiates have also been generally employed to mitigate the symptoms of\r\nthe fully-developed disease. But, like all other medicines introduced\r\ninto the stomach or rectum, they are apt to be rejected, and even if\r\nthey are not, their absorption is very doubtful, so that at the height\r\nof the attack they must be considered as nearly if not quite useless.\r\nWhen the vomiting and purging begin to subside and reaction is about\r\nto commence, small and repeated doses of opiates undoubtedly tend to\r\nlessen the evacuations; but great caution must be observed not to\r\nexceed the due degree of stimulation, lest a dangerous state of\r\nnarcotism or collapse be induced. It might be supposed that the\r\nhypodermic use of morphia would be less open to objection than its\r\nadministration by the stomach; but it is to be remembered that the\r\nsuspension of gastric absorption is only a part of the similar\r\ncondition affecting the whole circulatory system, and that the\r\nstagnation of the blood in the systemic veins prevents the absorption\r\nof medicines administered subcutaneously perhaps as completely as the\r\nstate of the gastric blood-vessels interferes with their absorption\r\nfrom the stomach itself. In point of fact, the utility of opiates at\r\nany stage of cholera after the first is not easily determined, for\r\nnearly always they are associated with other medicines, and especially\r\nwith astringents. In this disease, as in others that involve life, we\r\nare seldom at liberty to test the powers of individual medicines, but\r\nare bound to endeavor to save life by associating those which seem to\r\nbe required for the purpose. Opiates, then, are nearly always given in\r\nconjunction with astringents or stimulants {768} during the first (or\r\ndiarrhoeal) stage of the attack, but after vomiting is added to\r\ndiarrhoea and a tendency to collapse is manifested they are at least\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe patient, it has already been said, should be disturbed as little\r\nas possible, and hence, if he becomes restless, and especially if he\r\nis rendered so by pain, he should be tranquilized by means of\r\nanæsthetics. Chloroform has generally been employed, and is best\r\nadministered on the first accession of cramps. Much pain, with\r\nmuscular fatigue and depression, is thus saved, and the inhalation of\r\nthe medicine may be repeated as often as the pain threatens to return.\r\nNo doubt other anæsthetics, and especially ether, would answer the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nCamphor has been claimed to be a valuable medicine in cholera, but\r\nthere is no clinical evidence that it is so. Indeed, the only series\r\nof cases in which it was mainly depended upon gave a large mortality.\r\n\r\nAcids have been employed in cholera, but chiefly on theoretical\r\ngrounds, \"in the hope of destroying the specific cholera process going\r\non in the intestinal canal\" (Macnamara). It is hardly necessary to\r\ndiscuss so vague a reason. What specific process is going on? What\r\nrelation to it has the administration of acids? And, after all, only\r\nthe hope is held out of destroying the hypothetical morbid process.\r\nThe reaction of normal stools is usually acid, but sometimes it is\r\nneutral or even alkaline. In other acute bowel complaints with profuse\r\ndiarrhoea they are acid, as in cholera infantum, but in epidemic\r\ncholera they are alkaline, because they consist chiefly of the water\r\nof the blood. It is far from proven that mineral acids can be useful\r\nmerely by reversing the reaction of the stools. Far more probable is\r\nit that, in so far as they are of use, it is because they act as\r\nastringents upon the digestive mucous membrane. This may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that, according to the advocates of these medicines, it\r\nis always difficult, and is often impossible, to acidify the stools in\r\ncholera. Moreover, it must be remembered that, like other medicines,\r\nthe greater part of them are rejected by vomiting. If, then, mineral\r\nacids tend to lessen the diarrhoea of cholera, they act by their\r\nastringency and not by their acidity. Diluted or aromatic sulphuric\r\nacid may be given in the dose of from two to thirty minims, at\r\nintervals of an hour, in acid water or carbonated water, or diluted\r\nnitric acid, in doses of from twenty to fifty minims, at the same or\r\nsomewhat longer intervals.\r\n\r\nIntravenous injections were used in England during the first epidemic\r\nof cholera in 1832-33, but their results were regarded as unfavorable;\r\nsubsequently, in 1849, they were tried with somewhat better success,\r\nand in 1867 the effects were still more encouraging. The liquid\r\nemployed on the last-mentioned trial consisted of chloride of sodium\r\n60 gr., chloride of potassium 6 gr., phosphate of sodium 3 gr.,\r\ncarbonate of sodium 20 gr., alcohol 2 drachms, and distilled water 20\r\nounces. The alcohol was added only when the liquid was about to be\r\nused, and the temperature of the latter was not allowed to exceed 110°\r\nF. or fall below 100° F. The liquid was contained in a zinc vessel\r\nholding about eighty ounces, with a lamp underneath, a thermometer\r\nhanging within, and a tap near the bottom, from which proceeded an\r\nindia-rubber tube four feet long, with a silver nozzle at its end. The\r\nfluid was allowed to enter the vein by the force of gravity. If\r\ndifficulty was experienced in introducing the nozzle, the vein was\r\nfreely exposed, supported on a probe, and incised longitudinally. It\r\nwas found that the success of the operation depended greatly {769}\r\nupon having an ample supply of the solution prepared, so as to repeat\r\nthe injection as often as might be found necessary. Mr. Little, who\r\npractised this method in numerous cases, stated as follows: \"When a\r\npatient has been long pulseless clots form in the heart, and, as I\r\nhave seen, extend into the larger veins. In one case the fluid would\r\nnot flow in, and only distended the veins of the arm injected. After\r\ndeath clots were found extending from the heart into the axillary\r\nvein.\"[70] Five out of twenty apparently hopeless cases recovered\r\nunder this treatment. The first effect of the injection was to revive\r\nthe pulse, which had ceased to be felt; the voice also was restored,\r\nthe color and expression improved, the cramps were relieved, the\r\ntemperature rose, and the patients became convinced that their\r\nrecovery was assured. A profuse perspiration and a severe rigor\r\naccompanied these symptoms. The rigor was evidently a nervous\r\nphenomenon, and not a chill, for it occurred when the temperature was\r\nrising. Other cases might be cited which unquestionably owed their\r\nrecovery to this mode of treatment. It is true, however, that much\r\nmore frequently it failed of success; and probably not only because\r\nthe injection could not reach the heart, but because, having permeated\r\nthe blood-vessels of the whole body, it escaped, as the serum of the\r\nblood had done, from the damaged intestine. Nevertheless, it would\r\nseem that an expedient which in a certain proportion of cases has been\r\nquite successful might yet be rendered more certain in its results if\r\nthe operative procedure were perfected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _London Hosp. Reports_, iii. 470.]\r\n\r\nCramps in the limbs may be lessened by active friction and shampooing,\r\nbut there is no clinical reason for believing that these measures tend\r\nto restore the circulation. Equally ineffectual are other means used\r\nfor communicating heat to the algid body and thereby reviving its\r\nfunctions. It is true that some physicians found that warm baths, at\r\nfrom 90° to 104° F., gave relief to the cramps and restored the\r\nfailing pulse. In most cases the calming influence of the bath was\r\nnoted, but it does not seem to have been curative or to have\r\ndiminished the mortality-rate.[71] It should not be forgotten that the\r\npatient has no perception of his coldness. In all analogous\r\nconditions, as has already been remarked, such as frostbite and the\r\ncold stage of periodical fevers, cold, and not heat, promotes\r\nreaction. Still more injurious, if possible, than hot applications are\r\nirritants and stimulants after the stage of collapse has set in. Not\r\nonly are they absolutely futile for restoring the animal temperature,\r\nbut they are liable, unless very cautiously used, to produce\r\nintractable sores upon the skin if recovery ensues. It should also be\r\nremembered that the cholera patient's exhaustion is exceptionally\r\ngreat, and is apt to be increased by the officiousness implied in the\r\nuse of many stimulating agents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Ibid._, iii. 445; _St. Bartholomew's Reports_, iii.\r\n190.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1832 a marked advantage was ascribed to the use of cold\r\naffusions in cholera.[72] One of the physicians of the cholera\r\nhospital of Berlin said: \"In these living corpses which are struck\r\nwith asphyxia, lying cold and powerless, external and internal\r\nmedicines cease to stimulate; no steam apparatus, no warm bathing, no\r\nfriction, no irritant, avails.\" The condition is comparable to that in\r\napproaching death by cold, in which friction with snow is well known\r\nto be the proper remedy. Cold affusions were employed in the second\r\nstage of the disease. If the pulse revived, the affusions were\r\ncontinued in a tepid bath, after which the patient was {770} put to\r\nbed and gently rubbed with cold flannels. Internally, ice-water was\r\nfreely administered. Labadie-Lagrave[73] refers to forty cases treated\r\nin this manner, with only seven deaths. Yet the cold-water treatment\r\ndoes not appear to have commended itself to physicians generally.\r\nEvidently it does not meet the prime indication, which is to restore\r\nthe wasted waters of the blood and retain it in the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Ainsworth, _Pestilential Cholera_, 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Du Froid en Thérapeutique_, 1878.]\r\n\r\nCold water ought to be given as freely as possible to assuage the\r\nthirst that exists in every stage of cholera, and especially in\r\ncollapse. Nor should it be withheld because it will presently be\r\nrejected, for not only does it produce a grateful sensation in the\r\nmouth and throat, but it renders the act of vomiting easier. Yet, to\r\nsome extent at least, the thirst may be allayed by rinsing the mouth\r\nand throat with cold water. Iced water is preferable to ice used for\r\nthe same purpose, for the latter, by its relatively intense coldness,\r\nirritates and dries the mouth. Fragments of ice swallowed whole allay\r\nthe burning heat in the stomach.\r\n\r\nOn the hypothesis that the cholera poison consists of organic germs\r\nvarious antiseptics have been employed in this disease. Permanganate\r\nof potassium was fortunately excluded from the list, on account of its\r\ncorrosive action, but, unfortunately, carbolic acid was conceived to\r\npossess virtues that rendered it an eminently suitable remedy, and\r\ncreasote, which resembles it very closely, was presumed to possess\r\ncorresponding virtues. Then sulphurous acid and the sulphites, which\r\nfor a time were warranted to destroy every species of germ, were\r\nconfidently appealed to to stay the progress of cholera, and it was at\r\none time even a matter of dispute whether sulphite of sodium or\r\nsulphite of potassium was the more efficacious. In truth, all of these\r\nmedicines were useless, even when they were not mischievous.\r\n\r\nCholera has never prevailed in any country without giving rise to\r\nextraordinary theoretical and practical divagations. One physician in\r\nthe earliest American epidemic gravely proposed, as the best mode of\r\nchecking the diarrhoea, to plug the anus with a soft velvet cork.\r\nAnother, in England, suggested that the \"blood may be kept circulating\r\nby putting the patient on his back on a board and keeping up a\r\nrocking, see-saw, to-and-fro movement from eighty to one hundred times\r\na minute.\" Another had the revelation that the disease is essentially\r\na \"paralysis of the sympathetic nerve and want of performance of the\r\norganic functions, with deficient vitality of the mucous membranes,\"\r\nand that its proper remedies are \"bleeding, turpentine, and cool\r\ndrinks, without heat and stimulants;\" and to this remarkable doctrine\r\na well-known physician gives his adhesion, thus: \"The cause, I firmly\r\nbelieve, is an union of the poison with the sympathetic.\"[74] Still\r\nanother discovered that the disease is a spinal disorder, and is to be\r\ntreated by the application of ice-bags to the spine. Were not the\r\nevidence so palpable, it would hardly be believed that such irrational\r\nideas should have been published concerning a disease which had then\r\nbeen under observation by the whole medical profession in Europe and\r\nAmerica for more than thirty years, and in Asia for a much longer\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Times and Gazette_, Aug., 1866, p. 209; _ibid._, Nov.,\r\n1866, p. 555.]\r\n\r\nThe most important lesson to be drawn from this history of the\r\ntreatment of epidemic cholera is, that the arrest of the disease in\r\nthe diarrhoeal stage is comparatively easy, and that in the stage of\r\ncollapse its cure by any means whatever is altogether an exceptional\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{771}\r\n\r\nTHE PLAGUE.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES C. WILSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An acute specific fever of short duration and very fatal,\r\nendemic in certain Oriental countries, and frequently epidemic; it is\r\ncharacterized by buboes, carbuncles, and petechiæ.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--([Greek: plêgê], _plaga_, a stroke); the Pest; Pestilence;\r\nthe Bubonic, Glandular, Inguinal Plague; the Oriental, Levantine,\r\nLevant Plague; the Indian, Pali Plague; Máhámari; Septic or Glandular\r\nPestilence; Pestilential Fever, Adeno-nervous Fever; Typhus\r\nPestilentialis, Gravissimus, Bubonicus, Anthracicus, etc. _Gr._\r\n[Greek: ho loimos]; _Lat._ Pestis; _Fr._ La Peste; _Ger._ die Pest,\r\nBeulenpest.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.--The plague, pest, pestilence, and their equivalents\r\nin various tongues, are terms that have been used from the earliest\r\nhistorical times to designate every epidemic disease attended by great\r\nmortality. As knowledge of diseases becomes clearer the terms by which\r\nthey are designated become more definite; those which did service for\r\na class are restricted to particular groups, and new names are found\r\nfor other maladies only allied to such groups by superficial\r\nresemblances. Hence by degrees the term plague has become more\r\nrestricted in its use. To-day it is understood as designating\r\nexclusively the specific affection defined above, the bubo plague.\r\n\r\nThe student of medical history meets with insurmountable difficulties\r\nin attempting to classify the recorded epidemics which have been\r\ndescribed under this term. Even when used in its more restricted\r\nsignification, difficulties as to the propriety of its application to\r\ncertain epidemics arise. Thus, nosologists are not in agreement as to\r\nwhether the great plague--the black death--which swept over Europe in\r\nthe fourteenth century and destroyed in three years twenty-five\r\nmillions of inhabitants, was a modification of the bubo plague or an\r\nessentially different disease. A like difference of opinion exists in\r\nregard to the relationship between the Indian or Pali plague which has\r\nfrom time to time prevailed in North-western India during the present\r\ncentury and the true plague.\r\n\r\nThe black death of the fourteenth century and the Pali plague, though\r\npresenting many of the characteristics of bubo plague, differ from it,\r\nwhile they resemble each other, in one important particular. Among the\r\nearlier and more common symptoms of note are those dependent upon\r\ngangrenous inflammation of the lungs, a lesion, according to\r\nHirsch,[1] extremely rare in bubo plague. This author informs us that\r\nrecent observations have fully confirmed the early opinion that the\r\nPali plague {772} differs from that of the Levant chiefly in this\r\nmodification, and cites Pearson and Francis as saying of the former\r\ndisease that \"the collective symptoms are more like those of plague\r\nthan of any other known disease.... We believe it to be in all\r\nessential particulars identical with the plague of Egypt.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Handbuch der historisch-geographischen Pathologie_, Dr.\r\nAugust Hirsch, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThe three forms of plague--(_a_) the grave (or ordinary), (_b_) the\r\nfulminant (pestis siderans), and (_c_) the larval or abortive,\r\nobserved in epidemics and hereafter to be described--do not represent\r\ndistinct varieties of the disease, but are merely expressions of\r\ndifferences in the intensity of the action of the infecting principle\r\nupon different groups of individuals in given communities--differences\r\nto be explained here, as in the other infectious diseases, in part by\r\nvariations in the activity of the poison itself, in part by the\r\nindividual peculiarities and susceptibilities of those exposed to it.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SKETCH.--Upon the authority of Rufus of Ephesus, quoted by\r\nOribasius,[2] it is stated that the bubo plague prevailed as an\r\nendemic, and at times as an epidemic disease, in Libya, Egypt, and\r\nSyria prior to the beginning of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Medicinalia Collecta_.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 542 A.D., according to Procopius,[3] the plague appeared\r\nin Egypt, at Pelusium; extended westward to Alexandria; eastward to\r\nPalestine, Syria, and Persia; passed from Asia Minor to Europe, where\r\nit first invaded Constantinople, whence it spread in all directions\r\nwith such fury that before the close of the sixth century one-half the\r\ninhabitants of the Eastern empire had perished, either of the plague\r\nitself or of the universal destitution that followed in its train.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Hirsch.]\r\n\r\nWith this epidemic, known in history as the Justinian plague, this\r\ndisease established itself for the first time in Europe, where it\r\nmaintained foothold for more than a thousand years.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century the wide prevalence of the\r\nplague in Europe began to draw to an end. In Spain it was epidemic for\r\nthe last time from 1677 to 1681; in Italy the last general epidemic\r\ncame to a close in 1656, although local outbreaks continued to occur\r\ntill the beginning of the following century. In France it still\r\nprevailed in several provinces in 1668, although it had for the most\r\npart disappeared some years before. In Switzerland we encounter it for\r\nthe last time in 1667-68; in the Netherlands in 1677; from England the\r\nplague disappeared with the great outbreak of 1665. In the early part\r\nof the eighteenth century two important epidemics occurred within the\r\nboundaries of Europe. The first spread from Turkey, through Hungary\r\nand Poland, to Russia, thence to Norway and Sweden, and along the\r\nshores of the Baltic Sea to the Low Countries. This epidemic came to\r\nan end in 1714. Six years later the last great outbreak of the plague\r\non European soil took place. It prevailed with great fury in\r\nMarseilles in 1720-21, and overran the whole of Provence. From this\r\ndate till the close of the century Europe remained free from the\r\nplague, with the exception of Turkey and the contiguous countries.\r\nDuring the second and third decades of the present century repeated\r\nepidemics occurred in the Balkan Peninsula and the regions bordering\r\non the Lower Danube and the Black Sea. The plague appeared also in\r\nMalta in 1813, and prevailed till 1815, and in 1816 it reached certain\r\nof the Ionian Islands. {773} Only twice has this pest shown itself\r\nduring the present century in Western Europe--once, during the\r\nepidemic at Malta in 1815, at Noja, a town of the Neapolitan province\r\nof Bari; the second time, in 1820, at Majorca, whither it was carried\r\nover from the coast of Barbary.\r\n\r\nBetween 1552 and 1784 the plague prevailed twenty-six times in Tunis\r\nand Algiers. Some idea of the importance assumed by this scourge in\r\nthe countries of North-western Africa may be found from the fact that\r\nmany of these epidemics lasted continuously for years, that which came\r\nin 1784 not ceasing for fifteen years. Between 1816 and 1821 the\r\nplague again prevailed in Tunis and Algiers, and again in 1836-37.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the present century a change took place in\r\nthe prevalence of the disease elsewhere. Shortly before its complete\r\ndisappearance from Europe it ceased to prevail in Western Africa (with\r\nthe exception of the Nile countries), in Mesopotamia, and in Persia.\r\nIt disappeared from Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine in 1843, from\r\nEgypt in 1844.\r\n\r\nFor a short period the plague seemed to have disappeared altogether.\r\nThose who cherished this hope were, however, destined to\r\ndisappointment. In 1853 an outbreak occurred in the Assyr country,\r\nWestern Arabia; and from that time till the present unmistakable local\r\nepidemics of the bubo plague have occurred in isolated regions of\r\nAfrica and Asia; thus, in 1858 at Benghazi in Tripoli; in 1857 in\r\nMesopotamia; in 1863 in the district of Maku, Persian Kurdistan; in\r\n1867 in the marsh district on the right bank of the Euphrates; in 1870\r\nin Persian Kurdistan; in 1871-73 in the Yunnan province, Western\r\nChina; in 1873 in the marsh district on the left bank of the\r\nEuphrates. During four years following the outbreak of 1873 the\r\ndisease continued to prevail over an extensive area in the countries\r\nbordering on the northern banks of the Persian Gulf. In 1874 it\r\nreappeared also in the Assyr district, Western Arabia, and in\r\nBenghazi, Northern Africa. In 1876, whilst still infesting the regions\r\nabout the Lower Euphrates, the plague appeared in South-eastern\r\nPersia, and during this and the following years it appeared at several\r\nisolated points on the borders of the Caspian Sea. Early in 1878 the\r\ndisease was reported as prevailing in the district of Souj-Bulak,\r\nPersian Kurdistan, and it appeared in October of the same year at the\r\nCossack village Vetlanka, on the Lower Volga, district of Astrakhan,\r\nRussia, after an absence from Europe of thirty-seven years. It has\r\nmore recently prevailed in the Assyr district, Western Arabia, and\r\nthere have been rumors of its reappearances in Persian Kurdistan.\r\n\r\nThe Indian or Pali plague (Máhámari) has prevailed in local epidemics\r\nof great severity on several occasions during the present century in\r\nthe North-western provinces of India. This fever was first recognized\r\nin Kutch in May, 1815, after a season of great scarcity of food. It\r\nspread rapidly over an extensive territory, and appeared in the spring\r\nof the following year at various points in Guzerat, next in Merawi,\r\nlater in Rhadenpur, spreading thence westward to Sindh. Not until the\r\nfollowing year (1817) did the pest reach the British possessions. This\r\nepidemic continued to prevail until 1821. The disease did not reappear\r\nuntil July 6, 1836, when it broke out in Pali, the principal dépôt of\r\ntraffic between the coast and North-western India. It spread with\r\ngreat rapidity to the {774} adjoining provinces. Toward the close of\r\nthe year 1837 the disease broke out anew in Pali, and raged until the\r\nspring of the following year. In 1834-35, again in 1837, there were\r\noutbreaks of this pest in Gurwal, and in 1846 and 1847 in Karmoun,\r\nprovinces of the southern slopes of the Himalayas. This destructive\r\npest has raged at an altitude of 10,300 feet, and we learn from Hirsch\r\nthat it has never wholly disappeared from the mountain-districts of\r\nthe Himalayas since 1823, and that its ravages in these regions have\r\nbeen so great that certain settlements have been wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe fever was remittent in type, with a great tendency to become\r\ncontinued; it was characterized by rapidly developing extreme\r\nprostration, and was very fatal. In most cases there were glandular\r\nswellings in the groins, armpits, and neck. Carbuncles and petechiæ\r\nare not mentioned as having been observed. Dyspnoea, cough, and bloody\r\nexpectoration were frequent symptoms. Vomiting, at first of bilious\r\nmatter, later of dark, coffee-colored fluid, was likewise common.\r\n\r\nThe plague has never appeared in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--1. Predisposing Influences.--Whilst the present views as to\r\nthe causation of the specific diseases compel us to assume a specific\r\ninfecting principle as the real cause of every outbreak of the plague,\r\nthere are certain circumstances which are recognized as so favoring\r\nthe development and action of that principle that they have come to be\r\nlooked upon as indirect or auxiliary causes of particular epidemics.\r\nIt is more in accordance with the facts to speak of them as\r\npredisposing influences. Chief among these circumstances is that\r\ncombination of physical and social wretchedness which goes hand in\r\nhand with poverty and overcrowding. The plague has been termed by a\r\nrecent observer (Cabiadis) miseriæ morbus, and he has thus reproduced\r\nin 1878 a name applied to the great plague of London in 1665--the\r\npoor's plague. All observers of recent epidemics unite in ascribing to\r\npoverty the foremost rank among the predisposing influences of plague\r\nepidemics. It is only necessary to enumerate the evils which form the\r\ntrain of poverty, whether in cities or in villages, to complete the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nWith poverty come ignorance and neglect of all sanitary laws;\r\novercrowding and ill ventilation; personal filthiness; improper as\r\nwell as insufficient diet; indifference as to the location of\r\ndwellings and their surroundings. The condition of the villages which\r\nhave been the scene of some of the recent epidemics beggars\r\ndescription. All observers unite in testifying to such accumulations\r\nof filth in and around the houses as requires to be seen to be\r\nbelieved. In these communities latrines are unknown, and no such thing\r\nas organized scavenging has ever existed.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of unburied or imperfectly buried corpses has been\r\nlooked upon as the real cause of the plague, and some of the recent\r\nepidemics have followed the prevalence of distinctive epizoötics.\r\nWhilst it is not difficult to disprove that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the effluvia from exposed and rotting carcasses can give\r\nrise to outbreaks of the plague, it is more than probable that an\r\natmosphere charged with such emanations (together with other causes)\r\ncan so unfavorably influence a community as to increase its\r\nsusceptibility to the specific cause of this or any other infective\r\ndisease. There can be but little doubt that the {775} dead bodies of\r\nthe victims of the plague are capable of disseminating the disease,\r\nand that the reopening of graves containing such bodies, even after a\r\nlong period of time, has given rise to fresh outbreaks of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe season of the year does not appear to exert any very marked\r\ninfluence upon the development of epidemics, if we base our deductions\r\nupon observations made in different countries. In northern countries\r\nthe disease has prevailed as severely in mid-winter as in summer. The\r\nepidemics of London showed a rise during July and August, their\r\nfurious prevalence in September, and a gradual decline during October\r\nand November. In Constantinople the disease has commonly remained\r\ndormant during the winter months, and become active as the weather\r\ngrew hotter. In Egypt, on the contrary, the activity of the outbreaks\r\nhas developed in winter, increased with the advance of spring, and\r\nsuddenly abated upon the advent of the summer. Such also has been the\r\ncase with the three general epidemics in Mesopotamia studied by\r\nTholozan.[4] \"Their beginning took place in winter, their development\r\nduring the spring, their decline and their extinction in summer. Their\r\nrecrudescences obeyed the same laws: after an incubation during the\r\nsummer season ... revivification took place in winter and in spring.\"\r\nIt is added in this writer's account that the exceptional hot weather\r\nof summer in that country, and especially that of the shores of the\r\nPersian Gulf, has always moderated or directed the course of epidemics\r\nof this pest. In Cairo the epidemics have usually ceased upon the\r\nrecurrence of intense summer heat in June. Dampness, and particularly\r\na thoroughly wet soil, are favorable to the development and spread of\r\nthe disease. The marshy regions of the Lower Euphrates, the shores of\r\nthe Caspian and the Black Seas, the valley of the Nile, have been the\r\nscenes of repeated visitations. On the other hand, the plague has\r\nmaintained its foothold in the mountainous districts of Western\r\nArabia, in Yunnan, on the slopes of the Himalayas at a great\r\nelevation, and upon a dry, non-alluvial soil even more firmly than in\r\nthe low and humid plains of Mesopotamia.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Histoire de la Peste Bubonique en Mesopotamie_, 2d\r\nMémoire, Paris, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Tholozan, _Histoire de la Peste Bubonique en Perse_, 1st\r\nMémoire, Paris, 1874.]\r\n\r\nIndividual predisposition to contract the disease seems to be\r\nincreased by all depressing influences, among which may be mentioned\r\nexcessive bodily or mental exertion, intense and prolonged anxiety,\r\nfear, and the like. Previous debilitating disease also increases the\r\nliability to the attack. Neither sex nor age exerts an influence in\r\nthis respect, save that after the age of fifty few contract the\r\ndisease. Occupation confers no immunity. Physicians, nurses, and\r\nothers occupied in the care of the sick, and those who bury the dead,\r\nhave especially suffered in recent[6] as well as in the older\r\noutbreaks. Oil-carriers and dealers in oils and fats, and to a less\r\ndegree water-carriers and the attendants at baths, are said to enjoy a\r\ncomparative immunity from attack. Those who have suffered from the\r\ndisease and recovered also enjoy a relative immunity. Second attacks\r\nare usually of less intensity than the first.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See summary of a report addressed by Dr. G. Cabiadis to\r\nthe Constantinople Board of Health on the outbreak in Astrakhan in\r\nRussia, 1878-79, by E. D. Dickson, M.D., _Medical Times and Gazette_,\r\n1881, vol. i. pp. 4, 32, 119.]\r\n\r\n2. The Exciting Cause.--The exciting cause of the plague must, in\r\n{776} the present state of our knowledge, be assumed to be a specific\r\ninfecting principle. Upon no other hypothesis can the continued\r\nexistence of a disease so specific in its characters, unchanged\r\nthrough the course of centuries, disappearing when the influences\r\nfavorable to its presence cease, reappearing in certain regions when\r\nthey again arise, be explained. Capable of being transmitted by the\r\nvehicles of commercial intercourse, of control by quarantine and\r\ncordons sanitaires, of spreading from limited foci of contagion into\r\noverwhelming epidemics, the plague is the very type of the infective\r\ndiseases. The nature of this infecting principle is wholly unknown. It\r\nis probably a microphyte capable of development within the human\r\norganism--capable also of a prolonged independent existence under\r\nfavorable circumstances outside of the body, and of again giving rise\r\nto the disease. The plague is properly to be classed as a\r\ncontagious-miasmatic disease (Liebermeister) with cholera, dysentery,\r\nand enteric fever. It continues to exist by the continuous propagation\r\nof its cause, and it spreads by the transportation of that cause.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded on all hands that the plague has never arisen\r\nautochthonously in Europe, but has in every instance been conveyed\r\nthither. Those who regard its reappearance after long intervals of\r\ntime in those countries where it still occasionally prevails as\r\nspontaneous are compelled to ignore difficulties in reasoning far\r\ngreater than the supposition of an equally prolonged condition of\r\nquiescence or an inexplicable or unsuspected reintroduction of the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAs to the disputed question of the contagiousness of the plague, to\r\nset forth the arguments and examples adduced in favor of either view\r\nwould far exceed the limits of the present article. All the facts are\r\nto be explained upon the theory that the exciting cause of the plague,\r\nlike that of cholera and enteric fever, consists of a miasm that must\r\nundergo certain changes outside the body before acquiring its virulent\r\nproperties, and that the time required for these changes is\r\nexceedingly brief. But what the physical properties of this miasm are,\r\nor how it finds access to the body, or how it is eliminated, are alike\r\nutterly unknown to us.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that it is incapable of being freely\r\ntransmitted to great distances in the air. Whether or not it is\r\nconveyed or retained by the discharges from the bowel is not known.\r\nThe history of recently observed outbreaks, from which alone definite\r\nand trustworthy facts are to be obtained, goes to show that the\r\nexciting cause of the plague clings closely to the patients and their\r\nimmediate belongings. The closer the relation between those sick and\r\nthe healthy, the greater the risk that the latter will contract the\r\ndisease. Those in the house with the patients are more liable to fall\r\nsick than those in the adjoining houses--those who are constantly in\r\ntheir presence than those who occasionally see them. Thus, nurses much\r\nmore frequently contract the plague than doctors, though the latter\r\nhave in all epidemics been largely numbered among the victims. Among\r\n357 deaths in the outbreak in Vetlanka, already referred to, were a\r\npriest, his wife and mother, three doctors, six assistant medical\r\nofficers, and two Sisters of Mercy. Dr. Cabiadis remarks that the\r\ninformation obtained \"shows that the malady propagated itself, in the\r\nfirst instance, from the sick to their relatives and to those who\r\nlived with them or who assisted them during their illness. If, on the\r\none hand, these facts showed its contagious character, on the other\r\nhand evidence is {777} still wanting to prove whether this\r\ntransmission of the malady was caused by contact with the sick and\r\ntheir clothing, or by breathing an atmosphere impregnated with the\r\ndeleterious particles emanating from their morbid bodies.\"\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is from two to seven days. In the report of\r\nthe commission of the French Academy of Medicine, drawn up by Prus in\r\n1844, the statement appears that the plague has never shown itself\r\namong compromised persons after an isolation of eight days. The recent\r\noutbreaks tend to confirm this conclusion. L. Arnaud concluded from\r\nobservations made at Benghazi in 1874 that the mean duration of this\r\nperiod was five or six days, and that the maximum did not exceed eight\r\ndays. Cabiadis sets this stage down as three days as the rule, but as\r\noccasionally not exceeding twenty-four hours. He found no data,\r\nhowever, to show the longest period to which it could extend. Hirsch,\r\nfrom information collected in his investigation of the same epidemic\r\n(that of Astrakhan), concluded that the minimum period of incubation\r\nobserved was from two to three days, the maximum more than eight, and\r\nthat the average was five days. He states that very short or very long\r\nperiods were seldom observed.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Individual cases of the plague, as of other epidemic\r\ndiseases, differ in their onset and progress under different\r\ncircumstances and at different periods of particular outbreaks.\r\nBesides the ordinary form, to which as a type the greater number of\r\nthe cases more or less closely conform, there are, on the one hand,\r\nothers so severe that death takes place before the characteristic\r\nmanifestations have time to appear, and, on the other hand, cases so\r\nlight that such manifestations are but partly developed, and the\r\nnature of the malady is only to be recognized in the light of the\r\nprevalent epidemic influence.\r\n\r\nHence among the cases three forms are recognized: (_a_) The grave or\r\nordinary form; (_b_) the fulminant form; and (_c_) the larval or\r\nabortive form.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Grave or Ordinary Form.--The plague in typical cases is a\r\nfebrile malady of the most acute kind, with localizations in the form\r\nof buboes or carbuncles.\r\n\r\nThe course of the attack may, for convenience of description, be\r\ndivided into four stages: 1, the stage of invasion; 2, the stage of\r\nintense fever; 3, the stage of fully-developed localizations; and 4,\r\nthe stage of convalescence.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This formal division of the description is suggested in\r\nsome of the older accounts. (See \"_Loimologia; or, An Historical\r\nAccount of the Plague in London in 1665_, by Nathan Hodges, M.D., and\r\nFellow of the College of Physicians, who resided in the City all that\r\nTime, Lond., 1721.\")\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the plague in France in 1720 was the occasion of a\r\ngreat number of curious and interesting publications on this subject.]\r\n\r\n1. The stage of invasion is marked by a feeling of lassitude, by pains\r\nin the loins and extremities. There is extreme bodily and mental\r\nweakness, headache, fulness and throbbing of the head, dizziness. The\r\npatient's expression is dull, stupid; he replies to questions slowly\r\nor awkwardly, his face is pale, his eyes languid, his gait feeble and\r\nstaggering. The appearance in this stage has been compared by several\r\nobservers to that of a drunken man. Shivering occurs, but if fever be\r\npresent it is slight. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are symptoms\r\nsometimes {778} observed. This stage begins suddenly. It is often\r\nimperfectly developed, and it may last only a few hours or a day or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n2. The second stage is characterized by fever of the most intense\r\nkind. It is ushered in by a chill, sometimes slight, commonly severe.\r\nThe lassitude continues, the headache increases, the dulness deepens\r\nto stupor or gives way to delirium. The temperature rises to 102°-104°\r\nF., or even to 107.6° F. The pulse quickly mounts to 120 or 130. The\r\nskin is hot and dry; the patient complains of burning inward heat and\r\nof great, sometimes unbearable, thirst. The eyes are sunken and\r\ninjected; the tongue moist, pale, and thickly covered with a\r\nchalk-white or grayish pasty coating; the vomiting often continues.\r\nThe delirium is commonly active or noisy, and accompanied by great\r\nrestlessness; it may, however, be mild, tending to sopor or coma. The\r\nprogress of the disease now rapidly advances. The patient falls into\r\nthe so-called typhoid state. His tongue becomes dry, hard, and\r\nfissured; sordes collect upon the teeth and lips, bloody crusts about\r\nthe nostrils. At this time the evidences of failure of the forces of\r\nthe circulation become conspicuous. The pulse grows feeble, small,\r\noften irregular--sometimes it can scarcely be felt; the lips become\r\nbluish, the extremities cold. There is tendency to collapse. During\r\nthe course of this stage buboes begin to make their appearance.\r\nSometimes the enlargement of the superficial lymphatics is preceded by\r\ntenderness or pain of more or less intensity; often the glands are\r\nfound to be enlarged only upon search.\r\n\r\nThe termination of this stage is marked by a sudden fall of the\r\ntemperature to subnormal ranges (93.2° F. has been observed); at the\r\nsame time copious strong-smelling sweat not infrequently occurs. The\r\npulse grows feebler, and falls to 100 or below it, and the mind\r\nbecomes clearer.\r\n\r\n3. These changes lead up to the stage of fully-developed local\r\nmanifestations. The enlarged lymphatics are most commonly situated in\r\nthe groins or on the upper part of the thighs at a point below that\r\ncommonly the seat of venereal buboes; less often they are to be found\r\nin the armpits or the region of the angle of the jaw; as a rule, they\r\noccupy only one or two of these positions in the same patient. They\r\nvary in size from a little mass or kernel, only to be discovered after\r\ncareful search, to the bulk of a hen's egg or a mandarin orange. The\r\nswelling of the gland takes place at times with great rapidity.\r\nSuppuration is followed by the discharge of an ichorous pus, and not\r\nrarely by ulcerative destruction of the surrounding tissues.\r\nSuppuration occurs more frequently than resolution, but is\r\ncomparatively rare in fatal cases. Hence it has come to be popularly\r\nregarded as a favorable prognostic sign, whilst the early subsidence\r\nof the swelling has been looked upon as an omen of grave import.\r\n\r\nThe time of the appearance of the buboes varies greatly. In the\r\ngreater number of cases they have shown themselves on the second,\r\nthird, or fourth day of the attack, occasionally within six or eight\r\nhours of the beginning of the attack, and occasionally they have been\r\nobserved to precede the general manifestation of the disease; rarely\r\nthey have appeared as late as the fifth day. In many cases they are\r\nabsent altogether.\r\n\r\nCarbuncles demand attention as being among the characteristic local\r\nmanifestations of this stage. They are less common than buboes. Their\r\nusual position is upon the lower extremities, the buttocks, or the\r\nback of {779} the neck. In favorable cases the gangrene after a few\r\ndays becomes limited and the slough separates. Boils also occasionally\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nPetechiæ occur in the worst cases, and often at an early period in the\r\ncourse of the disease. Their appearance usually indicates a fatal\r\nissue. They occupy at times extensive areas of the body or the greater\r\npart of its surface; at times they appear only in the neighborhood of\r\nthe buboes. They vary in size from a mere speck to spots several lines\r\nin diameter. When very numerous they give a livid hue to the skin, and\r\nthat appearance to the cadaver to which, together with the high\r\nmortality, was doubtless due the term black death by which severe\r\nepidemics were known in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nVibices and extensive ecchymoses sometimes appear shortly before\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n4. The stage of convalescence sets in between the sixth and tenth\r\ndays. It is often protracted by prolonged suppuration of the bubonic\r\nenlargements. Both relapses and distinct second attacks have been\r\nnoted by recent as well as the older observers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing sketch of the course of the disease in\r\nits ordinary form it is necessary to describe certain other symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe attack has sometimes begun with a convulsive tremor, at other\r\ntimes with a prolonged shaking, which has lasted from six hours to\r\nthree days, the patient remaining free from fever and not complaining\r\nof cold. This condition has terminated in coma, followed speedily by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSometimes the attack has come upon the patient with great confusion of\r\nmind, so that he appears dazed, or else a curious distraction has\r\nbefallen him in the midst of his ordinary avocations. If absent from\r\nhome, such patients commonly at once set out to return, either\r\ntrembling and staggering as though tipsy, or else rushing wildly\r\nthrough the streets with frantic gestures and outcries.\r\n\r\nThe vomited matters are usually at first gastric mucus with bile,\r\nafterward dark coffee-colored fluid; in certain cases blood is\r\nvomited. Bleeding from the nose, lungs, bowels, vagina, and urethra\r\nhave also been observed. Cases attended by hemorrhages have in almost\r\nall instances terminated fatally.\r\n\r\nConstipation has been, as a rule, present during the acute stages;\r\nlater in the attack diarrhoea has occasionally occurred. It has been\r\nlooked upon as a favorable symptom.\r\n\r\nThe urine has been diminished and suppressed in grave cases.\r\nTrustworthy observations, both as to its quantity and its chemical\r\ncomposition, are wanting. It has been observed to contain blood.\r\n\r\nAs has been already pointed out, the Máhámari of North-western India\r\nhas been especially characterized by lung symptoms. Other regions also\r\nhave been visited by epidemics in which acute pulmonary lesions formed\r\na prominent part of the morbid complexus.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Fulminant Form.--Chiefly in the early days or weeks of\r\nepidemics, but to some extent also later, cases occur in which the\r\nintensity of the sickness is so great that the patient dies before its\r\nusual manifestations have time to develop. The duration of the whole\r\nattack, which ends fatally, is often not more than a few hours; its\r\nsymptoms, which differ but little if at all from those of similar\r\ncases of other epidemic diseases--such, for example, as epidemic\r\ncerebro-spinal fever in its fulminant {780} form--are of the most\r\naggravated character, and the patient perishes overwhelmed by the\r\ninfection as though struck by a thunderbolt. Profound disturbance of\r\nthe nervous centres, convulsions, coma, the rapid formation of vibices\r\nand petechiæ, collapse, are the speedy forerunners of the fatal issue.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Larval or Abortive Form.--Toward the close of an epidemic\r\nthe character of the disease usually undergoes a change. It becomes\r\nless malignant. The cases present the essential symptoms, but in\r\ndiminished intensity. Some cases terminate in an early defervescence\r\nwith rapid subsidence of beginning local manifestations; others\r\npresent merely the evidences of a slight disturbance of the general\r\nhealth, without any characteristic symptoms of the prevalent disorder;\r\nothers, again, are characterized by the appearance of buboes without\r\npain or fever. These swellings undergo resolution in fourteen days or\r\nthereabout. Exceptionally they suppurate.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the plague is from six to ten days in typical cases\r\nrunning a favorable course; those of fatal cases from one to twenty\r\ndays. Clot Bey[8] found the duration of the worst cases two or three\r\ndays, of those next in point of severity five or six days, whilst in\r\nmilder cases death did not occur until the second or third week. Of\r\n534 fatal cases noted by W. H. Colvill, 126 occurred one day after the\r\nattack, 80 two days after it, 105 three days, 76 four days, 60 five\r\ndays, 26 six days after the attack. After six days the number of\r\ndeaths rapidly declined; on the nineteenth day 1 death, and on the\r\ntwentieth day after the attack 11 deaths, occurred. It is said that\r\ndeath after the seventh day is commonly not in consequence of the\r\ndisease itself, but of sequels. Of 16 fatal cases in the village\r\nPrischib in Astrakhan, noted in the report of Dr. Cabiadis, and of\r\nwhom the names, as well as the day of their exposure, their falling\r\nsick, and their death are given, 1 died in one day, 4 in two days, 6\r\nin three days, 3 in four days, and 2 in six days.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _De la Peste observée en Égypte_, Paris, 1840.]\r\n\r\nThe mortality of the plague is greater than that of any other epidemic\r\ndisease. In all epidemics a large majority of those who contract the\r\ndisease die. This is especially true of epidemics at their beginning,\r\nwhen it has often happened that for a time all the cases have\r\nperished. Of this, as of other epidemic diseases, it is true that the\r\ndeath-rate has varied in different outbreaks and at different periods\r\nof the same outbreak. Colvill states that in the epidemic of 1874 in\r\nMesopotamia the mortality of stricken villages during the first half\r\nof the time was 93 to 95 per cent. of those attacked, but that\r\nafterward the majority of those attacked recovered. The same authority\r\nstates that in Bagdad in 1876 the mortality was 55.7 per cent. of\r\npersons attacked. Arnauld gives the mortality at Benghazi in 1874 as\r\n39 per cent. of attacks. The death-rate at Vetlanka was 82 per cent.\r\nof those attacked. In Toulon in 1721, of a population of about 26,000\r\nhuman beings, about 20,000 were attacked, and of these 16,000 died. It\r\nhas been by no means of rare occurrence that nearly half the\r\npopulation of towns have perished in an epidemic, or that small\r\nvillages have been completely depopulated by this scourge.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELS.--The appalling mortality of the plague on\r\nits approach, the rapidity of its spread, the popular commotion upon\r\nits appearance, its brief course, and the fact that its recent\r\noutbreaks have {781} taken place in regions where trained European\r\nphysicians have been, with a few exceptions, beyond reach, all unite\r\nin maintaining the gloom that has since the Middle Ages enveloped the\r\nclinical facts of this disease.\r\n\r\nOf its clinical course, beyond the brief outline already given, little\r\nis accurately known, of its complications still less. In some of the\r\nrecent epidemics, and particularly in the outbreaks of plague in\r\nIndia, the evidences of pulmonary lesions have been so conspicuous\r\nthat they deserve to be classed among the essential manifestations of\r\nthe disease rather than as complications; in others pulmonary\r\ncongestion, hæmoptysis, the evidences of croupous or catarrhal\r\npneumonia, have occurred in a small proportion of the cases. Aside\r\nfrom this, there is nothing to be said as to the complications.\r\n\r\nAmong the known sequels are protracted ulceration of the enlarged\r\nlymphatics, boils, superficial or deep abscesses, catarrhal pneumonia,\r\npertussis, mental troubles, and the like. Extensive and deep\r\ncicatrices are not infrequently found in the site of the ulcerating\r\nlocal manifestations.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The existing knowledge of the morbid anatomy of the\r\nplague is but scanty. The observers of the early outbreaks contributed\r\nnothing; the recent outbreaks have taken place under circumstances in\r\nwhich anatomical investigations were impracticable. The knowledge\r\nwhich we possess is almost wholly due to the investigations conducted\r\nby the French in Egypt at the close of the last and the beginning of\r\nthe present century, and again during the years 1833 to 1838.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of Bulant,[9] Clot Bey, and others point to gross\r\nlesions, such as are found after death in the acute stages of the\r\ninfectious diseases in general. The viscera were engorged with dark\r\nfluid blood; ecchymoses were often found in the mucous and the serous\r\nmembranes, in the substance of the different organs, and into the\r\nconnective tissue. The spleen was in almost all cases enlarged,\r\nsoftened, and of a dark color. Not rarely the kidneys were deeply\r\nengorged, and extravasations of blood into their substance, their\r\npelves, and into the surrounding connective tissues were often\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _De la peste oriental d'apres les matérnaux recuillés à\r\nAlexandrie, à Smyrne, etc., pendant les Années 1833 à 1838_, Paris,\r\n1839.]\r\n\r\nThe only constant and characteristic changes relate to the lymphatic\r\nsystem. The lymphatic glands were, as a rule, enlarged and deeply\r\ninjected with blood. Where no buboes existed the glands of the various\r\ncavities of the body showed evidences of acute inflammatory processes.\r\nIn some instances the affection of the glands appeared to be general;\r\nless frequently it was most conspicuous in, or apparently limited to,\r\none or more great groups. Thus, the bronchial, the mediastinal, the\r\nmesenteric, the lumbar, etc. were severally the seat of marked changes\r\nwith or without enlargement of superficial groups, or several of these\r\ngroups were at the same time implicated.\r\n\r\nIn no instance were symmetrical enlargements of the inguinal regions,\r\nthe axillæ, or the throat met with.\r\n\r\nAccording to Runnel,[10] in 2700 cases there were inguinal buboes in\r\n1841, axillary in 569, maxillary in 231; inguinal buboes occurred 175\r\ntimes on both sides, 729 times on the right only, 589 times on the\r\nleft only; the axillary buboes were double 9 times, right only 185,\r\nleft only {782} 163. Buboes of the neck only occurred 130 times, and\r\nof them 67 cases were children.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _A Treatise on the Plague_, London, 1791.]\r\n\r\nThe connective tissue surrounding the affected glands was the seat of\r\nan infiltration sometimes serous, sometimes cellular; it also very\r\ncommonly contained more or less extensive extravasations of blood.\r\nEven where no buboes appeared on the surface of the body the glands\r\nwere enlarged to twice their usual size or more. The substance of the\r\nglands in the larger swellings was at times uniformly red or violet,\r\nagain whitish or marbled or pulpy or denser, or of the consistence of\r\nfat. It was also sometimes soft like jelly, and rarely it contained\r\nminute collections of pus. Some observers speak of dilatation of the\r\nlymph-vessels in the neighborhood of the enlarged glands.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The difficulties attending the recognition of the plague\r\nat the beginning of an outbreak speedily subside. The rapid spread of\r\nthe disease, its frightful mortality, the overwhelming intensity of\r\nthe symptoms, the prompt occurrence of cases characterized by buboes,\r\ncarbuncles, or petechiæ, are collectively considered diagnostic of\r\nthis, and of no other disease whatever. In regions subject to the\r\nrepeated visitations of this pest there exists a universal\r\nunwillingness to mention even the name of a disease whose suspected\r\npresence alone is followed by consequences of the most serious nature\r\nto the freedom of personal and commercial intercourse. To this\r\nunwillingness, rather than to any real likeness between the plague and\r\nother diseases with which it has been compared, are to be traced most\r\nof the difficulties as to the differential diagnosis that have been\r\nraised, especially in the regions bordering on the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, necessary in this place to discuss the diagnosis\r\nbetween the plague and malarial and other pernicious fevers, malignant\r\ntyphus, epidemic dysentery, lymphadenitis, syphilitic buboes,\r\nparotitis, and so forth.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Preventive.--The efficient treatment consists in\r\nprophylaxis. The history of this disease indicates with singular\r\nclearness the measures which, properly carried out, are capable of\r\ncontrolling the spread of the epidemic diseases. These measures\r\narrange themselves into two groups, of which the first has to do with\r\nthe removal of the conditions familiar to the development of the\r\ndisease, the predisposing influences; and the second with the\r\nrestriction of the disease to the locality in which it shows\r\nitself--isolation, quarantine.\r\n\r\nThe conditions favorable to the development of the plague have already\r\nbeen set forth under the heading Etiology. They relate to poverty and\r\nignorance, and their attendant evils, in communities. They are those\r\nconditions which tend to disappear under the influences of\r\ncivilization, and in truth it may be said that at the present time the\r\nplague occurs only in half-civilized countries.\r\n\r\nPreventive medicine has achieved no other work comparing in magnitude\r\nand importance with the extinction of the plague in Europe. This was,\r\nto use the words of Hirsch, \"a gradual process, and kept pace in great\r\nmeasure with the development and perfection of the quarantine system\r\nwith reference to the Orient and the different countries of Europe.\"\r\nThis author continues: \"I cannot, in fact, understand how any one\r\ncriticising the facts without prejudice, and having regard to the\r\n{783} state of the plague in the East, can for a moment hesitate to\r\nattribute the chief cause of the disappearance of the plague from\r\nEuropean soil to a well-regulated quarantine system.\" The European has\r\nby no means lost his susceptibility to the disease. He is liable to\r\nattack in the East. His protection at home lies in the restriction of\r\nthe exciting cause of the disease to its present haunts.\r\n\r\nAny extended notice of quarantine and quarantine laws is beyond the\r\nscope of this article. It may be said, however, that with reference to\r\nthe plague measures quite unnecessary under ordinary circumstances\r\nassume the greatest importance when this disease makes its appearance\r\nin countries bordering upon Europe, and that no amount of hardship to\r\nindividuals necessary to avert so great a calamity as a plague\r\nepidemic could be looked upon as excessive. Indeed, we can with\r\ndifficulty realize the severity with which measures of isolation have\r\nbeen carried into effect at times when the devastation produced by the\r\nplague was still vividly remembered. Violation of the orders issued\r\nduring an epidemic has been punished with no less a penalty than\r\ndeath. It is related that upon the appearance of the plague in the\r\nlittle town of Noja in Lower Italy in 1815, troops were despatched\r\nimmediately to surround the place with a cordon. The town was\r\nencircled by two deep ditches, and opposite the gates three ditches\r\nwere spanned by drawbridges, which served as a means for the\r\nintroduction of provisions, but no other communication was allowed.\r\nOnly letters were allowed to leave the city, and these were first\r\ndipped in vinegar. Cannons were posted at the city gates. The ditches\r\nwere occupied by sentinels, who were ordered to shoot down any one who\r\napproached and failed to stand still the moment he was hailed. A\r\nplague patient who escaped while delirious and attempted to pass the\r\nlines was, in fact, shot dead. Outside this cordon two others were\r\nestablished. Those who disobeyed the orders were treated with the\r\ngreatest severity. An inhabitant of Noja, who had thrown a pack of\r\ncards to the soldiers, together with the soldier who picked it up, was\r\ntried by court-martial and shot.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Ueber die Pest zu Noja_, Nürnberg, 1818, quoted by\r\nLiebermeister in _Ziemssen's Encyclopedia_, article \"Plague.\"]\r\n\r\nLower Italy, possibly Europe also, owed its escape to the rigorous\r\nmeasures carried out in this instance; nor can it be doubted that the\r\nmeasures of isolation practised during the outbreak on the Volga\r\n1878-79 restricted the disease to the district in which it appeared\r\nand brought it to a speedy end. On this occasion three efficient\r\ncordons were established to isolate the infected places. The first\r\ncordon was put around every place where plague prevailed, to prevent\r\npersons from entering or quitting that locality until forty-two days\r\nhad elapsed after the last attack of the malady there. The second\r\ncordon was formed around the infected area, encircling all the\r\ninfected localities. Its circumference extended 800 kilometres, and\r\nwas guarded by pickets of soldiers stationed at intervals of five\r\nkilometres. This cordon had four quarantine stations. The third and\r\noutermost cordon was established round the whole province of\r\nAstrakhan. It served to control the functions of the inner cordons,\r\ninasmuch as all persons coming from within its area, who could not\r\nprove that they had undergone quarantine at the stations of the middle\r\ncordon, were stopped.\r\n\r\n{784} The complete disinfection of all clothing and other articles\r\nused in the service of the sick is to be included among measures of\r\nprophylaxis. It is no uncommon thing to destroy by fire the houses in\r\nwhich cases have occurred, along with their contents.\r\n\r\nNo efficient means of protection are known for those who during an\r\noutbreak cannot escape from the infected neighborhood. It would be\r\nwithout purpose other than to amuse the reader to reproduce the quaint\r\nfancies of the older physicians in this matter, or to dwell upon the\r\namulets and incantations, the absurd costumes, the protective power of\r\ntobacco, according to Diemerhoeck, or the disbelief in its virtues on\r\nthe part of Hodges, who preferred \"canary, of the best sort, of which\r\nhe frequently drank while he attended the sick.\"\r\n\r\nClinical.--\"The treatment of individual cases must in the present\r\nstate of knowledge be expectant and symptomatic. Notwithstanding our\r\nacquaintance with the symptoms that characterize plague, we are\r\nutterly ignorant of the treatment best suited to its cases\"\r\n(Cabiadis).\r\n\r\nPhysicians who have written from personal observation unite in\r\nadvising a treatment of the simplest kind. Ventilation, cleanliness, a\r\nliquid diet, abundant cool drinks, are to be ordered. The initial\r\ncollapse and the evidences of failure of the circulation call for the\r\nuse of stimulants, and especially of alcohol. Cold or tepid sponging,\r\nin accordance with the sensations of the patient, may be resorted to.\r\nIf there be high fever an energetic antipyretic treatment might be\r\ncarried out. Cold effusion is said to have been of use in many\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nPurging, bloodletting, mercurials, blistering, emetics, have proved\r\neither positively injurious or altogether without effect upon the\r\ncourse of the disease.\r\n\r\nOf drugs, ammonium chloride, salicylic acid, carbolic acid, quinine,\r\nhave been administered without positive effect.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the free inunction of oil from the very beginning of\r\nthe attack was affirmed to exert a favorable influence.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See Griesinger, _Virchow's Handbuch der Speciellen\r\nPathologie und Therapie_, ii. 2, s. 316.]\r\n\r\nIn early times the buboes were often incised, or even excised, as soon\r\nas they began to swell. More recently they have been treated with\r\nleeches or inunctions of mercurial ointment. The treatment by\r\npoultices and the evacuation of pus as soon as it can be detected is\r\nat present regarded with greater favor. Carbuncles are likewise to be\r\ntreated in accordance with accepted surgical procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{785}\r\n\r\nLEPROSY.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES C. WHITE, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Leprosy is a constitutional disease of chronic course and\r\nfatal termination, characterized by peculiar changes in the tissues of\r\nskin, mucous membrane, nerves, and most organs of the body.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Elephantiasis of Greek writers; Lepra of Arabian authors;\r\nAnssatz (Germany); Spedalskhed (Norway). The local names in use among\r\nthe numerous races in which it prevails are too numerous to be given\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--Although great confusion has existed among the most ancient\r\nas well as later medical writers with regard to the definition of this\r\ndisease, it having been confounded with several other affections\r\n(elephantiasis arabum, syphilis, psoriasis, morphoea, etc.), leprosy\r\nhas prevailed in certain parts of the world from the time of the\r\nearliest records. The biblical accounts show that it existed among the\r\nJews in Egypt, although it was not accurately distinguished from other\r\ndiseases resembling it in some respects. It was recognized in Greece\r\nbefore the Christian era, and in the early centuries after Christ it\r\nhad extended widely over Europe. In the seventh and eighth centuries\r\nspecial leper-houses were founded in Italy, France, and Germany. The\r\ndisease reached its height in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies, when 19,000 lazarettos are said to have been in existence.\r\nIts spread was greatly increased by the constant intercourse kept up\r\nbetween Europe and the East during the Crusades. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury it began to diminish, and in the course of the seventeenth it\r\nhad almost wholly disappeared from the most civilized states. It has\r\nlingered, however, in other parts, and exists to-day in France and\r\nSpain and Portugal, in Norway and Sweden, and in Italy, Greece, and\r\nSouthern Russia. As in ancient times, it is widely spread along the\r\ncoasts of Africa and prevails largely throughout Asia. It is found in\r\nmany of the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, in Japan, New\r\nZealand, Madeira, the West Indies, extensively in some of the states\r\nof Central and South America and Mexico and the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to trace its history in the United States and\r\nadjacent districts more minutely. It is not known just when leprosy\r\nwas introduced into North America. According to the Louisiana\r\nhistorian, Gayarré, the Spaniards established leper hospitals in\r\nseveral of their colonies on the Gulf of Mexico during the last\r\ncentury. One existed in New Orleans as late as 1785. In 1776 the\r\ndisease was reported as existing among the blacks in Florida. It seems\r\nto have died out, and with {786} it all remembrance of its former\r\nexistence amongst us, until within the last few years, when its\r\noccurrence in the Southern States has again attracted attention. In\r\nLouisiana the first case was discovered in 1866 in an old woman whose\r\nfather came from the south of France; she died in 1870. In 1871 it\r\nappeared in one of her sons, in 1872 in two others, and in 1876 in a\r\nnephew. A sixth case developed in a young woman who was in constant\r\nattendance upon the first case. In addition to this group, other cases\r\nhave been observed in several parishes, amounting to twenty-one in\r\nall, as collected by Salomon of New Orleans in 1878.[1] Two other\r\ncases, brother and sister, in Louisiana are known to the writer, one\r\nof whom has recently died under his care. In South Carolina the\r\ndisease is reported by J. F. M. Geddings[2] to have been observed in\r\nsixteen cases since the year 1846; four were Jews, four negroes, and\r\neight whites. In none was any hereditary taint to be traced. No new\r\ncases have developed since that report.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _New Orleans Med. and Surg. Journal_, March, 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Trans. Intern. Med. Congress_, Philadelphia, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See article on \"Contagiousness of Leprosy\" by writer, in\r\n_Amer. Journ. of Med. Sciences_, Oct., 1882.]\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota and other North-western States leprosy has been known to\r\nexist for a considerable time among the Norwegian immigrants who have\r\nsettled in them in large numbers. Holmboe in 1863 and Prof. Boeck\r\nlater made visits to these colonies while in this country, and\r\npublished reports concerning them after their return.[4] The latter\r\nfound eighteen cases among his countrymen, most of which were leprous\r\nbefore emigration; in others the disease developed after arrival in\r\nAmerica. It had not manifested itself in any person born in this\r\ncountry. The character and progress of the affection seem to have been\r\nlittle influenced by residence here. Since these observations other\r\ncases have been collected by the committee on statistics of the\r\nAmerican Dermatological Association,[5] showing the continuance of the\r\ndisease in these States. In 1879 there were fifteen cases in\r\nMinnesota. Its spread in this portion of our country is slow.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _British and For. Med.-Chir. Review_, Jan., 1870, and\r\n_Nord. Medic. Ark._, Bd. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See _Transactions_.]\r\n\r\nSince 1871, 52 cases of the disease have been inmates of the hospital\r\nfor lepers in San Francisco, California. Of these, all, with one\r\nexception, were Chinese, and forty-five of them had been sent back to\r\nChina. It is presumed to have shown itself after arrival in this\r\ncountry, as \"unproductive labor would not be imported by the Six\r\nCompanies.\"[6] No case of the disease known to have been acquired in\r\nthis country has yet been reported upon the Pacific Coast. One case\r\nhas developed in San Francisco after residence in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Trans. Am. Derm. Assoc._, 1881.]\r\n\r\nIn Oregon, too, the disease has appeared among the Chinese immigrants,\r\nsteps having been recently taken to re-ship five lepers from the\r\npoor-farm at Portland to China.\r\n\r\nSince 1815, possibly earlier, leprosy has prevailed among the poor\r\nFrench settlements along the Miramichi River, near the Bay of\r\nChaleurs, New Brunswick. It was first noticed in a woman whose mother\r\ncame from Normandy, and has continued mainly in her descendants since.\r\nNo measures were taken to control the disease until 1844, when a\r\nhospital was erected on Sheldrake Island. In 1849 the present\r\nlazaretto at {787} Tracadie was established. During the first five\r\nyears (1844-49) there were admitted 32 patients; from 1849 to 1863, 67\r\nadditional patients were received; and from the latter date to 1879,\r\n30 more, making a total number of 129 up to the last report. The\r\ngreatest number present at any one time was 37. In 1878 there were 16\r\npatients in the lazaretto--6 men and 10 women. The total number of\r\ndeaths in the hospital has been, up to 1878, 123. A. C. Smith, who\r\nresides near Tracadie, states that at the latter date but three cases\r\nwere known to exist outside the lazaretto. Residence is not\r\ncompulsory, and no sufficient measures are taken to remove patients\r\nfrom their homes before they may have inoculated other members of the\r\nfamily. The disease is more restricted in locality than formerly.\r\n\r\nWithin the last two years two or three small groups of the disease\r\nhave been discovered in the island of Cape Breton, which are described\r\nin the _Canadian Journal of Med. Science_, Sept., 1881.\r\n\r\nThese are all the places north of Mexico where the disease exists in\r\nan endemic form. A considerable number of cases have been reported\r\nwithin the past few years from other parts of the United States, where\r\nit has manifested itself in persons who have formerly resided in\r\nleprous countries or in those who have wandered from the above\r\ninfected districts. A very few instances have been recorded in which\r\nit has appeared in those who have never visited any infected locality\r\nor have been in apparent contact with lepers. Such cases, if\r\nauthentic, establish the possibility of a sporadic origin of the\r\naffection. The fact of so many foci already established, and the\r\npenetration of a race so prone to the disease as the Chinese into all\r\nparts of the country, give the study of leprosy in America a special\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The study of the etiology of leprosy is intimately\r\nconnected with that of its history and geographical distribution. From\r\nthe earliest times it was regarded in all parts of the world as a\r\ncontagious affection, and efforts were made by the sternest laws of\r\nChurch and State to control its spread by segregation, by interdiction\r\nof marriage, etc. No disease has ever been regarded with an equal\r\ndegree of abhorrence by mankind; none has received greater attention\r\nfrom physicians of every age. Within the present century it has come\r\nto be regarded, almost without exception, by the profession as\r\nnon-contagious. Peculiarities of climate, soil, and modes of life have\r\nbeen looked upon as predisposing, exciting, or even essential\r\ninfluences in its causation; but the widespread distribution of the\r\ndisease, with the consequent diversity of diet and customs of living,\r\nits prevalence upon the coast and in interior regions, in high\r\naltitudes as well as at the sea-level, in Iceland as in the tropics,\r\nshow that these conditions, however they may affect the course of the\r\naffection, have no direct relation to its causation. The theory of\r\nheredity, as the most plausible explanation, has received its\r\nstrongest support in the investigations of Boeck and Danielssen in\r\nNorway, where the disease can be traced for several generations in\r\nfamilies. The same conclusions readily present themselves where the\r\ndisease is studied in restricted localities, as in Louisiana and New\r\nBrunswick at the present time, where, as we have seen, it manifests\r\nitself closely in families in different generations. But this is a\r\nnarrow point of view from which to study the etiology of leprosy. It\r\noften fails to manifest itself in the descendants of lepers in {788}\r\nsuch communities, and affects persons in whose families it has never\r\npreviously existed. Moreover, in countries where it does not prevail\r\nit not infrequently attacks individuals who have at some time visited\r\nregions where it was endemic, and in the latter places may develop in\r\nimmigrants from parts of the world where it has never existed.\r\n\r\nThe same class of facts which seem to demonstrate its hereditary\r\nnature may be used in support of its infectious character. The proper\r\nfield for observation in this regard would be a virgin region where\r\nits natural course could be studied independently of theories.\r\nFortunately for science, such an opportunity is afforded in the\r\nhistory of the disease in the Hawaiian Islands. The exact date and\r\nmode of its introduction there are not definitely known. The islands\r\nhave for years been the resort of the whaling-fleets manned by sailors\r\ncoming from leprous regions. The natives also shipped as sailors, and\r\nafter visiting such ports returned home. The absence of any restraint\r\nin the intercourse of crews and native women is well known. Isolated\r\ncases may have occurred as far back as 1830, but the disease made slow\r\nheadway until about 1860, when it increased so rapidly that the\r\ngovernment took stringent measures to control it, all cases discovered\r\nbeing sent to the leper segregation upon an island from which there is\r\nno escape. Since 1866, 2000 cases have been received there, and at\r\nlast report the asylum contained 750 inmates. This by no means\r\nrepresents the extent of its prevalence in the islands, however. As\r\nthe native population by recent census was only 44,000, it will be\r\nseen that the proportion affected is very large. This unwonted\r\nrapidity of spread cannot be accounted for on the ground of heredity.\r\nTransference from individual to individual by inoculation seems to be\r\nthe only possible explanation, and all resident physicians believe\r\nthat the disease is contagious in this sense. It affects almost\r\nexclusively those of native descent, and their habits of life are such\r\nas would greatly facilitate its wide dissemination in this way--viz.\r\ntheir great licentiousness and absence of all fear of the disease,\r\nwhich affords no bar to ordinary association or cohabitation; the\r\ncrowding of large families in small huts and sharing the same mats and\r\nblankets; the eating of poi with the fingers from the same dish;\r\npassing a common drinking-vessel or pipe from mouth to mouth, etc.[7]\r\nPromiscuous and compulsory vaccination with impure virus, too, has\r\nbeen generally practised during recent epidemics of small-pox. It is\r\nevident that abundant opportunity has in many ways been presented for\r\nthe inoculation of pus or blood into the circulation from infected to\r\nhealthy persons. Where immunity from contraction has followed marriage\r\nwith a leper, it may be assumed that the conditions of an abraded\r\nsurface and the contact with pus or blood have not been fulfilled. The\r\nwide spread of syphilis among the natives, and a consequent cachexia,\r\nhave no doubt contributed to these conditions and established a\r\nnational lack of resistance to the ravages of the disease. Nor can we\r\noverlook the proclivity of all endemic diseases to extraordinary\r\nmanifestations of virulence in insular nations not previously\r\nprotected by gradual inoculation. Many reliable cases are cited by\r\nresident physicians where the evidence of direct communication of the\r\ndisease seems to be reliable. Facts of the same nature may be\r\ncollected in the study of the history of {789} the disease in New\r\nBrunswick and in Louisiana, where, as above stated, much better fields\r\nfor investigating this question exist than in the Old-World regions\r\nwhere the affection has been rife for centuries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Dr. G. W. Woods, U.S.N., in _Hygienic and Med. Reports_\r\nof Navy Department, vol. iv., 1879.]\r\n\r\nIf we admit the fact of transference by inoculation in a single\r\ninstance, there is no reason why we should not regard this as the\r\nprincipal if not the only means of extension of the disease, whether\r\nwe accept or not the theory of its parasitic nature. It is not\r\ninconsistent with our knowledge of its laws and history to believe\r\nthat leprosy is an affection communicated with difficulty, and after a\r\nprolonged period of incubation, from one person to another by contact\r\nwith certain products of the diseased tissue; that it has in past and\r\npresent time in this way spread from nation to nation; and that its\r\nprogress as an endemic affection has been checked only by laws based\r\nupon this theory. All the negative facts so frequently urged against\r\nthis doctrine of contagion apply as strongly to that of heredity, and\r\nmay be interpreted in support of the former. The latest investigations\r\ninto its pathology afford tangible evidence in its favor. It may at\r\nleast be claimed that the question of contagion through inoculation\r\nmust be reopened.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See article on the question of contagion in leprosy in\r\nthe _American Journal of Med. Sciences_, Oct., 1882, by the writer.]\r\n\r\nLeprosy affects both sexes in about equal degree, and may first show\r\nitself in early childhood. It is apt to produce sterility, so that\r\nmarriages between lepers are rarely fruitful. This result seems to\r\nlimit the extension of the disease under the law of heredity if we\r\nadmit its action. There can be no doubt that cohabitation may take\r\nplace for years without communication of the disease where one party\r\nalone is leprous; and such immunity may be explained by the failure of\r\nfavorable conditions for sexual inoculation, just as in syphilis. The\r\ndisease would naturally be most dangerous in its ulcerative tubercular\r\nform.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--There are two well-marked forms of leprosy--viz. the\r\ntubercular and the anæsthetic--which are characterized by certain\r\neasily recognized external manifestations, and which are accompanied\r\nby symptoms indicative of disturbances of the general economy as well\r\nas of special organs. These forms are not always sharply defined, and\r\noften occur simultaneously or in succession in individual cases. Both\r\nare generally preceded by premonitory symptoms, consisting of\r\nunaccountable languor of mind and body, tingling sensations in the\r\nskin, rise of temperature in the evening, and various disturbances of\r\ndigestion, or by the occasional outbreak of single or several blebs.\r\nThis prodromal stage affords no indication of the type of disease to\r\nfollow, and may last for days, months, or even years, with greater or\r\nless intervals and intensity.\r\n\r\nTUBERCULAR LEPROSY.--This form may declare itself at once by the\r\ncharacteristic tubercles, but frequently an earlier manifestation is\r\nthe appearance of macules or dull red spots, varying in size from a\r\npea to two or three inches in diameter. They have an indistinct\r\nmargin, a glazed and smooth surface, and become paler on pressure. The\r\npatches, although not at all or but slightly elevated above the\r\ngeneral surface, are firmer, and penetrate more or less deeply into\r\nthe cutaneous tissues. They may increase in size peripherally and\r\nundergo involution in the older central portions simultaneously.\r\nDuring the latter process the color changes from a more or less dull\r\nred to a brown, yellow, or grayish tint, and {790} finally may become\r\nquite white. The spots also become thinner or even slightly depressed.\r\nTheir seat is principally the trunk, but also the limbs, and less\r\nfrequently the face. This condition of the skin may precede any other\r\nchanges in its tissues for months or years, the patches appearing and\r\ndisappearing or remaining as permanent stains. At last well-defined\r\ntubercular elevations show themselves, varying in size from a small\r\nshot to a filbert, flattened or semi-globular in form, generally\r\nsmooth and firm to the touch, and of a dull red or brown color. They\r\noccur upon any part of the surface, but are especially abundant upon\r\nthe face, where they may cause great deformity of the features. The\r\nforehead and eyebrows may become very greatly thickened by general\r\ninfiltration, or thrown out into very prominent folds and\r\nprotuberances by the massing of individual tubercles. The lips\r\nthicken, the nose broadens, and the ears stand out conspicuously with\r\ntheir increased bulk. All these changes in form, with the great\r\ndarkening in tint which is often present, give at times a most\r\nrepulsive expression to the face. The tubercles are sometimes to be\r\nfelt imbedded in the skin, or considerable areas are found to be\r\nuniformly thickened and scarcely at all prominent. All forms are\r\ncapable of involution after an existence of months, and may leave\r\ndark-colored atrophic patches to mark their seat. They are rarely\r\npainful, and occasionally slightly sensitive. They may be transformed\r\ninto ulcers, especially upon prominent positions, as the knuckles,\r\nelbows, knees, as the result of pressure or injury, which are\r\nextremely indolent, although shallow, and may heal and break down\r\nrepeatedly. Occasionally they give rise to serious\r\ncomplications--inflammation of the lymph-vessels, suppuration of the\r\njoints with loss of the attendant members, as the fingers and toes.\r\nTubercles appear also upon the mucous membrane of the nasal cavities,\r\nthe mouth, and larynx, often in great abundance, causing a very\r\ncharacteristic hoarseness or loss of voice. With these changes in the\r\ncutaneous tissues, which may be accompanied in their periods of\r\ngreatest activity by febrile disturbances, there are developed after\r\nmonths or years, with gradual failure of strength, manifestations of\r\nchanges in the internal organs, the lungs, intestines, and brain,\r\nwhich may prove fatal at any time, or the patient may die of slowly\r\nprogressive marasmus. The course of the tubercular form is on the\r\naverage between eight and ten years. At any period there may supervene\r\nmanifestations of the anæsthetic type, which makes the so-called mixed\r\nvariety, in which either form may predominate.\r\n\r\nANÆSTHETIC LEPROSY.--This variety is characterized by the loss of\r\nsensation in the skin over areas of varying extent, which occupy no\r\ndefinite positions in relation to nerve-distribution. The anæsthetic\r\npatches may appear upon the seat of old maculæ or former tubercles or\r\nof a preceding bullous efflorescence, or upon parts not previously\r\naffected in any way. They may follow a reddened and hyperæsthetic\r\ncondition of the cutaneous tissues, or they may be surrounded by a\r\nserpiginous border of this character. The degree of anæsthesia in the\r\naffected parts is sometimes so complete that the skin and underlying\r\ntissues may be deeply pricked or cut or burned without the patient\r\nbeing aware of the injury. Such patches may possibly regain their\r\nsensibility. Their surface appears in later stages dry, wrinkled,\r\nshrunken, and of a brownish color, and atrophy, not only of the skin\r\nbut of the muscles, is gradually developed, {791} in consequence of\r\nwhich the expression of the face undergoes a marked change. The\r\neyelids and lips droop, the hair falls, the hands contract, and the\r\njoints of the fingers and toes are laid bare, so that the phalanges,\r\nor even the whole hands and feet, drop off. Ulceration or gangrene of\r\nthe parts may develop, and whole extremities may shrivel up. With\r\nthese manifestations of local derangements of nerve-action the\r\nfunctions of the brain fail, the patient becoming stupid and incapable\r\nof action or motion, the temperature and pulse are lowered, and death\r\ncomes slowly by marasmus or the most various complications--tetanus,\r\ndisease of the lungs, pyæmia, etc. The average duration of this form\r\nis from eighteen to twenty years.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The structural changes which take place in the\r\ntissues of parts which are the seat of the appearances above described\r\nhave received the special study of many excellent observers[9] in\r\nrecent times, and are now well understood. A section through the\r\nthickened skin or a tubercle shows the corium and underlying\r\nconnective tissue infiltrated with round cells, as in lupus and\r\nsyphilis; in other words, converted into \"granulation tissue.\" This\r\nchange first takes place along the course of the cutaneous vessels and\r\nglands, penetrating more deeply and forming a firmer cell new-growth\r\nin proportion to duration, the cells being enclosed in a coarse\r\nmeshwork of fibrous tissue, and encroaching upon the various\r\nstructures of the skin, so as to produce atrophy and finally\r\ndestruction of all its characteristic tissues. This cell-infiltration\r\nmay of itself undergo later changes, as fatty degeneration and\r\nsoftening (ulceration). The lymph-glands and corpuscles assume a\r\nspecial fatty metamorphosis. An examination of the tubercles upon the\r\nmucous membrane reveals the same small-celled new-growth. In the\r\nnerve-tissues also marked structural changes are found, both in the\r\ncentral and peripheral systems, in the anæsthetic form of the disease.\r\nIn many cases the posterior segments of the gray cornua and the fibres\r\nof the commissure, as well as the nerves of the extremities, have been\r\nfound altered by inflammation, which will account for the disordered\r\nsensibility and the subsequent disturbances of nutrition, muscular\r\natrophy, etc. The nerve-trunks are often to be felt beneath the skin,\r\nthickened and sensitive on pressure. The chronic cell-infiltration\r\naffects the fibrous structure of the outer sheath, the neurilemma, and\r\nthe septa between the nerve-bundles, producing fatty metamorphosis and\r\natrophy of the nerve-bundles. Similar cell-infiltrations are found\r\nalso in the connective tissue of all the internal organs of the body,\r\nwhich lead to destructive processes in their respective structures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Boeck and Danielssen, _Traité de la Spedalskhed_, Paris,\r\n1848; Virchow, _Die Krankhaften Geschwülste_; Kaposi in _Hebra's\r\nLehrbuch der Hautkrankheiten_; Monasterski, _Vierteljahressch. für\r\nDerm. u. Syph._, 1879, p. 203; Hansen, _Virchow's Archiv_, Band 79,\r\n1880; Neisser, _Virchow's Archiv_, Band 84, 1881; Cornil et Souchard,\r\n_Annales de Derm. et de Syph._, 1881, No. 4.]\r\n\r\nWithin the last two years repeated observations have been made which\r\nconfirm the statement published by Hansen in 1873, that a peculiar\r\nbacterium occurs in leprous tissues, which, it is claimed, establishes\r\nthe parasitic nature of the affection. These examinations have been\r\ncarried on with leprous material derived from many parts of the world,\r\nand the results have been uniform. Within the round cells which\r\ncharacterize the cutaneous neoplasms, both in the distinct tubercles\r\nand the diffused {792} infiltrations, small agglomerations of minute\r\nrod- or staff-like bodies (bacilli) are found, arranged in parallel\r\nrows or placed end to end. Their length is one-half or three-fourths\r\nthe diameter of a red blood-globule, and their breadth is one-fourth\r\ntheir length. With them minute granular particles are seen in the\r\ncells. They occur in greatest numbers in the cells of the upper layers\r\nof the true skin, which are considerably swollen by their presence.\r\nThey never penetrate the epithelial layer, nor are they found in\r\nepithelial cells in any position. When the protoplasm of the cell is\r\ninterfered with by the later tissue-changes of the disease, the\r\nbacillus perishes. They are found not only in the leprous cells, but\r\nalso in those of the connective tissue running between the\r\nagglomerated masses of the former. Between the leprous cells and the\r\nfilaments of connective tissue but few free bacilli are seen. The\r\nneoplasms of the mucous membrane and of many organs of the body have\r\nbeen found to contain them also. In the blood they have been detected\r\nby some observers. Their presence in the nerve-tissues is of\r\nimportance as throwing light upon the question of the specific or\r\ninflammatory nature of the morbid processes above described as\r\naffecting them. If we regard the bacteria as pathognomonic of leprous\r\ntissue-changes, their occurrence, recognized in the cells penetrating\r\nbetween the fibres of the peripheral nerves, would seem to make all\r\nprimary structural changes identical, and the anæsthetic as much as\r\nthe tubercular form the direct result of their presence. Neisser draws\r\nthe following conclusions from his investigations: \"Leprosy is a real\r\nbacterial disease, caused by a special kind of bacterium. The bacilli\r\nappear in the tissues as such, or more probably as spores, and remain\r\nfor a longer or shorter time in a state of incubation, according to\r\ncircumstances, in dépôts, perhaps in the lymph-glands. This period,\r\nmuch longer than in other infective diseases, is in proportion to the\r\nphysiological resistance of the human organism compared with the\r\nfeeble developing power of the bacilli. It, as well as the course of\r\nthe disease, is more rapid in tropical countries than in Europe. From\r\nthese dépôts the disease extends throughout the body in those portions\r\nof the skin most exposed, the face, hands, elbows, knees, and into the\r\nperipheral nerves. The other organs are less freely invaded. The\r\nbacilli excite inflammation, and by a specific action transform the\r\nmigrating cell into the leprous cell. Leprosy is probably an\r\ninfectious disease, and its specific products are contagious--viz. the\r\nleprous cells of the tubercles, the tissue-fluids, and the pus\r\ncontaining bacilli or viable spores. On the other hand, the pus may\r\nnot always be infectious, as the fluid contained in the bullæ is not.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be said that the bacterial nature of leprosy, if established\r\nin accordance with the above observations, furnishes a satisfactory\r\nbasis of explanation of all facts, historical, clinical, and\r\npathological, which have so long been awaiting solution. The inability\r\nof the parasite to penetrate the epithelial layer of the skin and\r\nmucous membrane explains why contagion is so difficult, and why the\r\nulcerative tubercular form would be more favorable to such\r\ntransference than the anæsthetic variety.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--Leprosy in some of its early appearances may be readily\r\nconfounded with vitiligo, morphoea, pemphigus, lupus, and syphilis. In\r\nsome cases its prodromal manifestations cannot be positively\r\ndiagnosticated until other symptoms have developed, which by\r\nconcurrence establish their true significance. Such are the\r\npemphigus-like bullæ, the {793} pigment-changes, and the smaller\r\ntubercular efflorescences. In regions where the disease occurs only by\r\nimportation, and in the so-called sporadic cases, it is not at all\r\nstrange that it should fail of recognition, even in well-advanced\r\nforms, unless the observer is acquainted with its whole\r\nsymptomatology. On the other hand, there is no disease which presents\r\nmore strikingly characteristic features in its advanced stages.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--Leprosy is almost uniformly a fatal affection, and its\r\ncourse toward this termination varies but slightly under the most\r\ndiverse conditions of life. Its development and progress are naturally\r\nmore rapid under circumstances of least individual resistance, where\r\nfood is poor and scanty, where extremes of climate are most felt,\r\nwhere the constitution of the individual or nation is debilitated by\r\nprevious disease, as that of the Hawaiians by syphilis, or where no\r\nproper professional care is employed. It has been believed that a\r\nchange of residence from infected to non-leprous regions would retard\r\nits advance or avert its appearance in those supposed to be\r\nhereditarily disposed; but the former effect follows probably only so\r\nfar as the general condition of the patient is affected by the change,\r\nas in other constitutional disorders, and the latter is necessarily a\r\nmatter wholly of conjecture. No case of leprosy in the Norwegian\r\ncolony in our North-western States has ceased to progress after\r\narrival toward its fatal ending, even if this has been somewhat\r\ndelayed in individual cases under more generous ways of living. If it\r\ncould be known that a child born in Norway had escaped leprosy by\r\nremoval to America, we should not, if we accept the bacterial origin\r\nof the disease, consider that climate or other mysterious influences\r\nhad overcome its inherited tendencies, but that it had been taken away\r\nfrom the chance of direct inoculation. It is stated that very rarely\r\ncases cease to progress beyond certain stages even in countries where\r\nthe disease is endemic. The course, as has been stated, varies\r\naccording to the clinical form, the duration of the tubercular variety\r\nbeing on an average but one-half that of the purely anæsthetic type.\r\nLeprosy may be called the slow disease, its period of incubation, so\r\nfar as this can be determined, extending from one to several years,\r\nits prodromal stage lasting often several more years, and its\r\nwell-developed forms requiring at times more than twenty years to\r\ndestroy the patient. Cases sometimes prove fatal, however, in a single\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--In a disease which affects so many of the races and such\r\ngreat numbers of mankind, which has been for centuries the object of\r\nspecial attention on the part of physicians, and of late years of\r\ngovernment commissions and of eminent pathologists, it is evident that\r\nevery remedy which the materia medica includes, as well as those of\r\nmerely popular reputation in the widely-diverse geographical regions\r\nin which it prevails, must have been employed in its treatment. None\r\nof them exert any specific action upon it; it remains incurable. Every\r\nyear some new article is employed with the usual claims of success\r\nwhich accompany the introduction of new remedies, but they merely\r\nswell the long list of failures in the therapeutics of the affection.\r\nStill, leprosy is influenced somewhat by medical care; life may be\r\nprolonged and made more comfortable. To this end we may employ\r\nremedies which are capable of improving and maintaining the\r\nconstitutional powers of resistance to the disease, such as are found\r\nof service in other chronic wasting affections. {794} The patient is\r\nto be put in as healthy ways of living as possible, removed from\r\ndebilitating localities, and given generous diet and tonics, as iron\r\nand quinia. Several new drugs which seem to stimulate the nutrition\r\nand produce temporary improvement in the local and general symptoms\r\nhave lately been widely employed, as Gurjun balsam and chaulmoogra\r\noil, but they have wrought no cure. Digestion is to be aided,\r\ndiarrhoea to be checked, and disturbances of respiration to be\r\nalleviated. Local treatment is also of service. The tubercles may\r\nsometimes be made to disappear--partly, at least--by stimulating\r\napplications, and ulcers made to heal by cauterization and other\r\nwell-known methods of dressing. These ulcers and their secretions\r\nshould be regarded as possible sources of infection by attendants and\r\nmembers of the patient's household. For the anæsthetic alterations in\r\nthe tissues but little can be done locally. If the bacterial origin\r\nand causation of the disease be eventually established, its future\r\nextinction must be based upon studies directed to the nature and mode\r\nof protection against this organism. Collectively, the disease should\r\nbe treated by every nation by thorough segregation, and importation\r\nshould be prevented by the most rigid quarantine laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{795}\r\n\r\nEPIDEMIC CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.\r\n\r\nBY ALFRED STILLÉ, M.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A febrile, and often malignant, but non-contagious\r\ndisease of unknown origin; usually occurring as a local epidemic;\r\nconfined hitherto to the North American and European continents, and\r\nto the vicinity of the latter; characterized by its rapid and\r\nirregular course, and usually by a tetanic rigidity or retraction of\r\nthe neck, a tendency to disorganization of the blood, and the\r\nformation of inflammatory exudates beneath the membranes of the brain\r\nand spinal cord.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Spotted fever; petechial fever; malignant purpuric fever;\r\nmalignant purpura; pestilential purpura; black death; typhus\r\npetechialis; typhus syncopalis; febris nigra; febbre\r\nsoporoso-convulsivo; tifo apoplettico tetanico; fièvre\r\ncérébro-spinale; typhus cérébro-spinale; phrenitis typhodes; epidemic\r\nmeningitis; epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis; malignant meningitis;\r\ntyphoid meningitis; méningite cérébro-spinale épidémique; méningite\r\ncérébro-rachidienne; Genickkrampf; Genickstarre.\r\n\r\nThe names which have been given to this disease convey more or less\r\ndistinctly one or the other of two ideas: 1st, that the disease is\r\nessentially a blood-disorder; and 2d, that it is an inflammation of\r\nthe cerebro-spinal meninges. Under the first head belong the following\r\nnames: Malignant purpuric fever; malignant purpura; pestilential\r\npurpura; petechial fever; spotted fever; febris nigra; black death,\r\netc. Under the second head belong epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis;\r\nepidemic meningitis; malignant meningitis; typhoid meningitis, etc. As\r\npartaking of the qualities of both categories may be cited the names\r\ncerebro-spinal fever and fever with cerebro-spinal meningitis. In\r\nregard to all those of the first class it is sufficient to repeat the\r\ncriticism made by the early American writers who described this\r\ndisease after having largely studied it. One only of them need be\r\ncited, because he expresses the opinion of all. Miner, writing in\r\n1822, said: \"It is quite unfortunate that a single symptom (petechiæ),\r\nand one, too, that is wanting in a great majority of cases, should\r\nhave been seized upon to give it the odious and deceptive name of\r\nspotted fever, as that name has been applied by European writers to a\r\nvery different kind of fever.\" Among the names given to the disease,\r\ncerebro-spinal fever is perhaps the least suitable and the least in\r\nharmony with the principles of scientific nomenclature. It is one of\r\nthose terms which may be pardoned when used by the laity, but which\r\neducated physicians ought not tolerate. Parallel examples may be found\r\nin such compounds as brain-fever, lung-fever, gastric-fever, and, most\r\nunfortunate of all, enteric fever. The first three of these are {796}\r\ninflammations, pure and simple, of the brain, lung, and stomach; and,\r\nafter their example, cerebro-spinal meningitis would be, what it is\r\nnot, merely an inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal\r\nmarrow. The name of the remaining disease has only to be turned into\r\nEnglish and called intestinal fever to demonstrate its defects. It is\r\nevident that other diseases--and dysentery in particular--are equally\r\nentitled to be called enteric fever. Moreover, there are cases of\r\nenteric fever in which death takes place so early that the intestinal\r\nlesion is undeveloped, and the fatal issue must be attributed to the\r\nfever-poison in the blood or else to the changes it has wrought in\r\nthat fluid. Analogous illustrations abound in the history of the\r\neruptive fevers. The disease we are studying presents another\r\naffection in which the septic element sometimes so far overrides the\r\ninflammatory as to destroy life before the latter has developed\r\ncharacteristic tissue-changes. There may be no valid objection against\r\nclassing it among the fevers, but there can be no excuse for\r\ndenominating it cerebro-spinal fever. The very reasons that militate\r\nagainst its being regarded as a meningitis forbid its being considered\r\nas a meningeal fever. But if it is a meningitis, inchoate or complete,\r\nthen the prefix epidemic denotes its constitutional nature and its\r\nprobable blood origin, and a term is employed which is descriptive and\r\naccurate, and not misleading. Moreover, the term epidemic indicates,\r\nor at least implies, the characteristic type of the disease, which is\r\nasthenic and sometimes more or less typhoidal, just as other\r\ninflammatory diseases become so in their epidemic form--_e.g._\r\npneumonia, bronchitis (influenza), dysentery, etc.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be no doubt whether epidemic meningitis should be\r\nclassed with general diseases or with inflammations. It is excluded\r\nfrom the latter class by the total absence of any tangible external\r\ncause from its causation, as well as by its frequent fatal termination\r\nbefore the characteristic signs of inflammation have had time to form,\r\nor because the peculiar type of the disease prevents their\r\ndevelopment. It belongs to the former class because it is epidemic in\r\nthe largest sense, its outbreaks occurring simultaneously in remote\r\nparts of the earth and independently of all cognizable celestial or\r\nterrestrial influences. In this as in other elements of its pathology\r\nthe disease stands absolutely alone. While the acute affections of the\r\npulmonary and digestive organs, which were just now alluded to, affect\r\nlarge districts, and even sweep over a whole continent, epidemic\r\nmeningitis breaks out in limited localities, and may for years prevail\r\nin a populous city within a hundred miles of another still more\r\npopulous which during that time may altogether escape its ravages. Of\r\nthis curious fact the cities of Philadelphia and New York present a\r\nstriking illustration. Since, then, we are ignorant of the\r\ncircumstances under which the disease arises, and since, as will more\r\ndistinctly appear later on, its several forms really include quite\r\nvarious morbid conditions, we are compelled to consider it as\r\noccupying a peculiar and exceptional nosological position.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--Previous to the present century the existence of this\r\ndisease can hardly be demonstrated. And yet Dr. B. W. Richardson\r\nbelieved that some faint traces of it could be discovered, as in the\r\nfollowing statement:[1] \"The great plague which visited Constantinople\r\nin 543, and which Procopius and Enagrius described, the plague of\r\n{797} hallucination, drowsiness, slumbering, distraction, and ardent\r\nfever, with eruption on the skin of black pimples the size of a\r\nlentil,--this plague, which usually killed in five days, and left many\r\nwho recovered with withered limbs, wasted tongues, stammering speech\r\nor such utterance of sound that their words could not be\r\ndistinguished,--this plague, which had passed into mythical learning\r\nunder the name of cerebro-spinal meningitis, has also in our time\r\nreappeared.\" The concluding statement in regard to the name of the\r\nplague is quite erroneous, and there is nothing in the description\r\nwhich distinctively applies to the disease we are examining. On the\r\nother hand, we know that Procopius wrote a history of the Oriental\r\nplague, which invaded Europe for the first time at the very date above\r\ngiven. It had as a distinctive symptom the well-known inguinal bubo,\r\nand there is no mention whatever, in the descriptions of it that have\r\nsurvived, of the tetanoid symptoms belonging to epidemic meningitis.\r\nIn 1802 an epidemic occurred at Roetlingen in Franconia which had a\r\ncertain resemblance to the subject of this article, for it was\r\ncharacterized by lacerating pains in the back of the neck. According\r\nto Hecker, this was the sweating sickness which had ravaged various\r\nparts of Europe during the Middle Ages, and of which limited outbreaks\r\nstill recur. In 1880 such a one took place at l'Ile d'Oléron in\r\nFrance, and many of the patients were affected with tonic or clonic\r\nspasms, both general and local, but not, apparently, opisthotonic.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Diseases of Modern Life_, p. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Pineau, _Archives gén. de méd._, tom. i., 1882, pp. 25,\r\n169.]\r\n\r\nIf epidemic meningitis occurred before the nineteenth century, it must\r\nhave been confounded with other affections, but when we consider its\r\ncharacteristic symptoms such an error seems improbable. The\r\ncomparatively rare resort at that time to post-mortem examinations,\r\nparticularly of the cranial and spinal cavities, may in part account\r\nfor such a confusion of ideas; and even when dissections were made,\r\nthe skill to interpret the discovered lesions was possessed by few. It\r\nhas been thought that in the latter part of the last century some\r\ncases of this disease were seen and described, although their\r\nnosological value was unrecognized. Thus, Stoll[3] speaks of a young\r\nsoldier who was seized with a pain in the back of the head and neck,\r\nand who was affected with opisthotonos before he died. On examination\r\npus was found between the arachnoid and the pia mater. The first clear\r\nand unquestionable description of epidemic meningitis was published in\r\n1805, first by Vieusseux and directly afterward by Mathey.[4] The\r\ndisease appeared at Geneva in the spring of the year, in a family\r\ncomposed of a woman and three children, of whom two of the latter died\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. A fortnight later four children in a\r\nneighboring family died of it after fourteen or fifteen hours'\r\nillness, and a young man in an adjoining house, being attacked, died\r\nthe same night, with his whole body of a violet color. The disease\r\nceased during the spring, after having destroyed thirty-three lives.\r\nIts distinctive features were an abrupt attack during the night,\r\nbilious vomiting, excruciating headache, rigidity of the spine,\r\ndifficult deglutition, convulsions, nocturnal paroxysms, petechiæ, and\r\ndeath in from twelve hours to five days. Vieusseux calls it \"a\r\nmalignant non-contagious fever,\" and Mathey gives as the lesions\r\nrevealed by dissection a gelatinous {798} exudation covering the\r\nconvex surface of the brain, and a yellow puriform matter upon its\r\nposterior aspect, upon the optic commissure, the inferior surface of\r\nthe cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Quoted by Boudin, _Hist. du typhus cérébro-spinal_, p.\r\n5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Journ. de Méd., Chirurg. et Pharm., etc._, an. xiv.,\r\ntom. xi, pp. 163, 243.]\r\n\r\nAfter its first appearance at Geneva the disease does not seem to have\r\nextended in any direction from that place as a centre, but we next\r\nhear of it at two points remote from it and from one another--Germany\r\nand the United States. From the former it extended to the conterminous\r\ncountries, Bavaria, Holland, and the east of France, where, however,\r\nit prevailed neither extensively nor fatally, and soon died out; while\r\nin America it first appeared at Medfield, Mass., in 1806. The European\r\nepidemic was faintly felt in England the following year, and between\r\nthat time and 1816 it prevailed at several places in the east of\r\nFrance, and slightly at Paris, while during the corresponding period\r\nit had extended through New England into Canada, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and several Western and South-western States. It is a\r\nnoteworthy fact that on both sides of the Atlantic it ceased in the\r\nsame year (1816). During the six following years we can discover no\r\ntrace of its existence, but in 1822-23 it reappeared at Vesoul in\r\nFrance, and at Middletown, Connecticut, and does not seem to have\r\nextended beyond those places. Again, after an interval of five years,\r\nin 1828 it was heard of in Trumbull co., Ohio, two years later at\r\nSunderland in England, and three years afterward (in 1833) at Naples.\r\n\r\nAfter four years of quiescence the disease entered upon a wider and\r\nmore destructive career than ever before, which was almost\r\nuninterrupted from 1837 to 1850. During the first two years of its\r\nrecurrence in Europe it was confined almost wholly to France. It began\r\nin the southern departments, with Bayonne as a centre, and extended\r\ngradually westward and northward, in some places attacking only\r\nmilitary garrisons and in others only civilians. Elsewhere the\r\npredilection was reversed, or, again, civilians and soldiers were\r\nequally affected. As Boudin has pointed out, \"it located itself in\r\ncertain districts; in garrison-towns it seemed to affect certain\r\nbarracks only, and in them only certain rooms. In one place it broke\r\nout in a prison and spared the soldiers; in another its victims were\r\namong the soldiers and the citizens, while the prisoners were\r\nuntouched.\" Thus the disease spread over the whole of France, and was\r\nmore fatal almost everywhere else than in Paris itself. Almost at the\r\ngates of the capital, at Versailles, and among the garrison, it was\r\nvery destructive in 1839, causing a mortality among those attacked of\r\nfrom 50 to 75 per cent. About the same time it occasioned a great\r\nmortality at other military posts, especially at Rochefort and Metz,\r\nand in 1840-41 at Strasbourg. In 1843 the disease had almost ceased to\r\nprevail in France, but in 1846 it reappeared at Lyons, and in the\r\nfollowing years, and until 1849, affected the garrisons of Orléans,\r\nCambrai, Saint-Étienne, Metz again, Lunéville, Dijon, Bourges, and\r\nToulon. In some of these places the military experienced five, and\r\neven seven, successive epidemics. Meanwhile, the disease spread to\r\nAlgeria (1839-47), and to Italy in the former year--not, however, on\r\nthe confines of France, but at Naples and in the Romagna, whence it\r\nextended to Sicily and Gibraltar, and did not cease there until 1845.\r\nIn 1839 it first showed itself in Denmark, and remained for about\r\nthree years, while in 1846 it \"appeared in the {799} majority of the\r\nworkhouses of Ireland,\" and in the spring of the same year it occurred\r\nin England, at Liverpool and Rochester.\r\n\r\nWhile the disease was thus spreading throughout Europe, it again, in\r\n1842, appeared in the United States, but at places as remote as\r\npossible from Transatlantic communication and hundreds of miles\r\ndistant from one another--_e.g._ in Louisville, Kentucky, in\r\nRutherford co., Tennessee, and in Montgomery, Alabama. In the\r\nfollowing year it prevailed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Illinois. In\r\n1848 it occurred again at Montgomery, Ala., and simultaneously, in\r\nBeaver co., Pa.; in 1849 it existed in Massachusetts and in Cayuga\r\nco., N.Y., and in 1850 at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBetween 1850 and 1854 epidemic meningitis ceased to be heard of, but\r\nin the spring of the latter year it began to appear in the southern\r\nprovinces of Sweden, whence it rapidly spread over the greater part of\r\nthe kingdom, reaching an extreme degree of fatality in 1858, and not\r\nfinally disappearing until 1861. It is said to have caused more than\r\nfour thousand deaths. It was not until the height of the Swedish\r\nepidemic in 1858 that it invaded Norway, where it seems to have been\r\neven more malignant and extensive. Between 1850 and 1860 local\r\noutbreaks of the disease took place in Ireland, and isolated cases\r\nwere observed in various parts of England, but in that country it has\r\nnever prevailed as a general epidemic. This fact alone is sufficient\r\nto defeat all the attempts that have been made to trace the origin of\r\nthe disease to any of the conditions associated with a crowded\r\npopulation. In Scotland, where such conditions exist in their greatest\r\nintensity and fulness of development, it has never occurred as an\r\nepidemic. During the decade under consideration (in 1856 and 1857)\r\nepidemic meningitis again appeared in the United States, and, as\r\nbefore, at points very remote from one another. In the former year it\r\noccurred for the first time in North Carolina, and in the latter year\r\nin the central portions of New York and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nHardly had the disease subsided in the Scandinavian peninsula and in\r\nthe United Kingdom when it reappeared in Holland during the winter of\r\n1860-61. In the following year and at the same season it occupied a\r\nlarge extent of Portuguese territory, including the cities of Oporto\r\nand Lisbon, and now for the first time it spread over Germany.\r\nBeginning slightly during the summer of 1863 in Prussia, it acquired\r\nnew vigor during the succeeding winter, and in the two following years\r\nit devastated almost every part of Northern Germany, and in 1864-65\r\nextended throughout Bavaria except in its southern and western\r\nprovinces. Strange to relate, the disease appears to have passed\r\nalmost wholly by Austria proper, and to have prevailed, although not\r\nextensively nor fatally, in Hungary, and in the latter part of the\r\ndecade in Istria, Greece, Turkey, and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe American counterpart of this epidemic first appeared in Livingston\r\nco., Missouri, in the winter of 1861-62, and during the same season it\r\ninvaded Indiana and Kentucky in the West and Connecticut in the East.\r\nFrom about the same date, and until 1864, it prevailed in Ohio, and\r\nduring the last-named year in Illinois. Cases occurred at Newport,\r\nRhode Island, in 1863, and in Vermont in 1864. In the winter and\r\nspring of the latter year it broke out at Carbondale, Pa., and in a\r\npopulation of 6000 caused the death of 400, principally among children\r\nand {800} very young persons.[5] In the winters of 1863-64 and of\r\n1864-65 it prevailed in the U.S. army, and in the early part of this\r\nperiod in the Confederate army which at the time was stationed near\r\nFredericksburg, Va. In North Carolina also, from 1862 to 1864, the\r\ndisease assumed a very malignant type, and affected citizens and\r\nsoldiers equally, and the latter in the Union and Confederate armies\r\nalike. During the winter of 1864-65 a limited but very fatal epidemic\r\nof the disease prevailed at Little Rock, Arkansas. About the same time\r\nit existed as an epidemic in Maryland, Alabama, and other Southern\r\nStates, and throughout the Civil War affected both whites and negroes,\r\nbut showed, as in France, an exceptional gravity among the military.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Burr, _Trans. Med. Soc. State of N. York_, 1865, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the disease in Philadelphia took place in\r\n1863, and from that date until the present (1884) it has never failed\r\nto appear among the causes of death in the reports of the Health\r\nOffice. A table compiled by Dr. C. F. Clark, and printed in a paper on\r\nthe subject by Dr. James C. Wilson,[6] exhibits the difficulties of\r\nobtaining accurate statistics, even from official reports, on this\r\nsubject. The medical profession of the city, having had but little\r\nknowledge of the disease either by reading or observation, reported\r\ndeaths from it which occurred in their practice under various\r\ndenominations. At first it was spotted fever, which continued to be\r\nused by many for a year or two, when it was superseded almost entirely\r\nby cerebro-spinal meningitis. There can be no doubt that both of these\r\nterms were used to designate the same disease, and therefore no error\r\nwill be committed in merging the deaths charged to each of them, and\r\nin estimating by their annual totals at least the relative mortality\r\nof the disease in the successive years of the period. But in the\r\nHealth Office reports there are at least three other rubrics that\r\nsuggest doubt. One is typhus fever, which seems to have presented a\r\nsudden and remarkable increase of mortality during the first years,\r\nand the most fatal, of the existence of cerebro-spinal meningitis. It\r\nshould also be observed that typhus fever is applied by many German\r\nphysicians in this country, as in their native land, to typhoid fever.\r\nA second is malignant fever, and a third is congestive fever, neither\r\nof which has claimed many victims in the health reports of\r\nPhiladelphia except while meningitis was epidemic. It seems probable,\r\ntherefore, that nearly all of the deaths charged under these heads\r\nbelong to the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Phila. Med. Times_, xiii. 88.]\r\n\r\n_Deaths in Philadelphia from Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis from 1863-82._\r\n\r\n                |  Brought over 1136\r\n  1863    49    |         1873   246\r\n  1864   384    |         1874    82\r\n  1865   192    |         1875    83\r\n  1866    92    |         1876    85\r\n  1867   109    |         1877    56\r\n  1868    55    |         1878    90\r\n  1869    37    |         1879    62\r\n  1870    36    |         1880    78\r\n  1871    49    |         1881    90\r\n  1872   133    |         1882    41 to Sept. 23d.\r\n        ----                    ----\r\n        1136             Total  2049\r\n\r\nIf to these deaths are added those charged to malignant fever, 111,\r\nand to {801} congestive fever, 279, we obtain a total of 2439 deaths,\r\nnearly all of which may be set to the account of epidemic meningitis.\r\nIt may also be remarked that up to the date at which this computation\r\nwas made (May, 1883) hardly a week passed in which the Health Office\r\ndid not register several deaths from this cause. Hence it would appear\r\nthat the disease continues to linger in this locality longer than has\r\nbeen reported of any other place from which information has been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn the city of New York it appears to have been much more limited both\r\nin extent and duration. The first recorded death from it was in 1861;\r\nin 1866 the deaths were 18; in 1867 the deaths were 32; in 1868 they\r\nwere 34; in 1869, 42; in 1870, 32; in 1871, 48. In 1872 the disease\r\nbecame epidemic, and \"from January 6 to May 31, inclusive, 632 cases\r\nwere reported to the City Sanitary Inspector, and 469 deaths to the\r\nBureau of Records of Vital Statistics\" (Clymer). After this period the\r\ndisease seems to have declined very rapidly, and not to have\r\nreappeared, since no notice is taken of its recurrence by the medical\r\njournals of New York.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned above that about 1870 some traces of the disease were\r\nobserved in Asia Minor, and in 1872 several cases are said to have\r\noccurred at Jerusalem,[7] but beyond that time and place it does not\r\nappear to have extended as an epidemic. In 1879, Cheevers said: \"I am\r\nnot aware of the existence of any report of an outbreak of the disease\r\nin India.\" He refers, however, to several cases occurring in Calcutta\r\nas possibly representing this affection.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Berlin klin. Wochensch._, May, 1872.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Times and Gazette_, Aug., 1879, p. 121.]\r\n\r\nIn 1867-68 sporadic cases occurred at Little Rock, Ark., and in the\r\nformer year in Madison co., N.Y., thirty-three cases were reported.[9]\r\nIn Chicago, between February and April, 1872, Dr. Davis reported forty\r\ncases observed in his own practice in seventy-two days. In the same\r\nyear the disease occurred at Elizabethtown, Ky.,[10] and at\r\nLouisville, Ky., in December of the same year. It existed in Michigan\r\nbetween 1868 and 1874, but only in the latter year epidemically, and\r\nnot to a very great extent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Trans. Med. Soc. State of N.Y._, 1868, p. 251.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Richmond and Louisville Journ._, Nov., 1872, p. 555.]\r\n\r\nOf later occurrences of the disease the following may be mentioned:\r\nSeveral cases were reported in London in 1867, 1871, 1876, and\r\n1878.[11] In 1870 four cases were observed in Providence, R.I.[12] In\r\n1882 cases were met with in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburg,\r\nWestern Ohio, Indianapolis, Detroit, Louisville, Memphis, New Orleans,\r\nRichmond, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, etc.,\r\nbut in none of these places did the disease become epidemic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Times and Gazette_, July, 1867, pp. 58, 59; Nov., 1867,\r\np. 511; _Guy's Hospital Rep._, 3d Ser., xvii. 440; _St. Bart's\r\nReports_, xii. 267; _Times and Gaz._, Aug., 1878, p. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Boston M. and S. Jour._, Oct., 1870, p. 261.]\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Epidemic meningitis has occurred in Europe and America in\r\nevery portion of the temperate zone, but its greatest prevalence and\r\nmortality have undoubtedly been in the northern rather than in the\r\nsouthern portions of that region. One of its most interesting features\r\nconsists in its appearing simultaneously at points very remote from\r\none another and having no connection with each other save through the\r\natmosphere. Of this statement several illustrations have already been\r\npresented. Another {802} peculiarity of the disease consists in its\r\noccurring with hardly any relation to external natural conditions or\r\nto those of its victims. It affects localities as diverse as possible\r\nin their geological, meteorological, and sanitary states, the rich and\r\nthe poor, the old and the young, and both sexes, and (as it is\r\ncertainly not in a strict sense contagious) its rise and spread must\r\nnecessarily be attributed to some occult cause pervading the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the prevalence of the disease has some relation to\r\nmeteorological agencies, for not only is it greater, on the whole, in\r\n_cold_ than in warm climates, but it is also greater in cold than in\r\nwarm seasons. Thus, if we examine the epidemics in Europe and America\r\nwe shall find that they almost invariably were most severe in the\r\nwinter and spring. Yet the rule presents several exceptions on both\r\ncontinents. In France, out of 216 local epidemics, more than\r\none-fourth took place during the warm months of the year, and in\r\nSweden the proportion was about the same. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat cold is not an essential cause of the disease. Among the problems\r\nthat remain unsolved in regard to this disease none is more obscure\r\nthan the apparent immunity of Russia from its ravages, although the\r\nclimate seems adapted to favor it, and the domestic habits of no\r\npeople are fitter to intensify it if individual conditions entered\r\ninto the etiology of the disease; but, in truth, no such causes are\r\nrelated to epidemic meningitis. Localities of every sort, high and\r\nlow, dry and moist, those saturated with marsh miasmata and those\r\nfanned by pure mountain-breezes, have been alike visited by this\r\ndisease. It has passed by large cities reeking with all the\r\ncorruptions of a soil saturated with ordure and populations begrimed\r\nwith filth, as Vienna, Berlin, Paris, London, and New York, to\r\ndevastate clean and salubrious villages and the families of\r\nsubstantial farmers inhabiting isolated spots.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest number of the subjects of epidemic meningitis are\r\nyoung persons. In Sweden, according to Hirsch, of 1267 fatal cases of\r\nthe disease, 889 occurred in persons under fifteen years of age, 328\r\nbetween sixteen and forty years, and 50 in persons of forty years and\r\nupward. In 1866, in the Kronach district (Germany), of 115 cases, 75\r\noccurred under the seventh year, 22 between the seventh and twelfth\r\nyears, and 10 between the thirteenth and twentieth years (Schweitzer).\r\nDuring 1865 a local outbreak of the disease in Bavaria affected 53\r\npersons, of whom 22 were children under ten years of age, 18 between\r\nten and twenty years, and 11 between twenty and thirty years. Under\r\nthe fifth year few were attacked (Orth). Dr. J. L. Smith[13] found\r\nthat, according to the reports of the Board of Health of the city of\r\nNew York, out of 975 cases, 771 occurred in persons under fifteen\r\nyears of age, the greatest number for any quiquennial period being 336\r\nin children under five years. Of the 469 deaths occurring in this\r\nepidemic, 216 were of children under five years of age, and the next\r\nlargest number for an equal period was 99, which represented the\r\ndeaths between the ages of five and ten years. Of adults or persons\r\nbeyond the age of twenty, the whole number was but 39. The peculiar\r\nliability to the disease of the young recruits in the French army has\r\nalready been alluded to. The proportion of male victims to this\r\naffection is rather larger than that of females in the civil\r\npopulation, but in France especially the excess was greatly on the\r\nside of males, owing to the prevalence of the disease in the army. In\r\nother places, as {803} in Sweden and Germany, the number of deaths\r\namong females equalled, or even exceeded, that of males, and in\r\nLeipsic the garrison remained exempt while the disease prevailed among\r\nthe citizens. In 1847 a fatal epidemic of it affected the second\r\nregiment of the Mississippi Rifles, and was entirely confined to that\r\ncorps (Love). During the Civil War of the United States the disease\r\naffected particular corps or regiments in the South or in the North,\r\nyet it never became epidemic in the army, even when the disease\r\nprevailed among the adjacent civil population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, Oct., 1873, p. 320.]\r\n\r\nVarious depressing or debilitating causes, such as lowness of spirits,\r\nhome-sickness, mental or bodily strain, over-eating, drinking alcohol,\r\nthe action of excessive cold or heat, checking perspiration, etc.,\r\nhave been enumerated as causes of this disease. It is unnecessary to\r\ndwell upon such gratuitous assumptions. All of these influences are\r\nconstant, but epidemic meningitis is the rarest of epidemic diseases,\r\nand the agencies referred to have no further operation than to lessen\r\nthe resistance of the body to morbid influences of every description.\r\nIf there be one peculiarity about this disease which is more\r\nsurprising and inexplicable than another, it is that its peculiar\r\nvictims are not the feeble and delicate, but the vigorous and\r\nactive--not the old and decaying, but the young and stalwart.\r\n\r\nNo one of authority has claimed that this disease can be propagated by\r\n_contagion_. All of its early American historians are of the same\r\nopinion upon this question, and nearly all European authorities are in\r\nperfect accord with them. The apparent exceptions to this all but\r\nuniversal judgment are so insignificant in number and weight as not in\r\nthe least to diminish its validity. A case has been published in which\r\na pregnant woman at full term died of the disease after giving birth\r\nto an apparently healthy child. \"Two hours later the infant presented\r\nsymptoms of meningitis, followed rapidly by death.\"[14] Supposing the\r\nconcluding statement to be accurate, the case only shows that the\r\ncause of the disease which destroyed the mother's life infected the\r\nsystem of the child also. If there is one point in the history of the\r\ndisease established by the concurring testimony of American and\r\nEuropean writers, it is the extreme rarity of its attacking either the\r\nphysicians and nurses in attendance upon patients affected with it, or\r\nthose laboring under other diseases and occupying beds adjacent to\r\npersons ill with epidemic meningitis. That, nevertheless, there is a\r\nmaterial morbific principle which inheres in certain localities, so\r\nthat those who occupy them successively are liable to suffer from this\r\ndisease, and that also this principle may be carried from place to\r\nplace so as to render certain houses (barracks) infectious, seems to\r\nbe demonstrated by the history of the disease in the French army.\r\nBetween 1837 and 1850, when the disease prevailed in various parts of\r\nFrance, it did so not indiscriminately, but it usually followed the\r\nordinary routes of communication, and especially the movements of the\r\nmilitary in their transfers from one post to another, and the course\r\nof navigable streams. Strangely, also, it attacked soldiers much\r\noftener than civilians. The most curious fact of all is one already\r\nreferred to--viz. that although the disease prevailed in almost every\r\npart of the provinces, and although then as ever an incessant stream\r\nfrom them was flowing into the capital, neither its civil nor its\r\nmilitary population was generally affected, nor, {804} indeed, at all\r\nso, until near the close of the period mentioned. Meanwhile, however,\r\nthe disease extended to several countries conterminous with France or\r\nin close and frequent intercourse with it--to Italy (1839-45), Algeria\r\n(1839-47), England, Ireland, and Denmark (1845-48). These events seem\r\nto point to a certain transmissibility of the disease until we examine\r\nthe negative facts that bear upon the question. They are such as\r\nthese: The epidemic did not spread at all from France into two of the\r\nadjacent countries, Belgium and Switzerland, with which the\r\nfirst-named country maintained an incessant intercourse by travel and\r\ntraffic, but, on the other hand, it broke out at an early date within\r\nthe period mentioned at places very remote and absolutely independent\r\nof all influence emanating from France or any other European\r\nsource--in the south-western portions of the United States. It is by\r\nnumerous facts of this description that we are compelled to remove the\r\ndisease from the category of endemic and even epidemic diseases, and\r\nrelegate it, along with influenza, to that of pandemic affections.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Med. Record_, xxii. 547.]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some reason for thinking that the epidemic cause of\r\nthis disease may affect the lower animals as well as man. It was\r\nstated by Gallup in 1811 that during the epidemic of meningitis in\r\nVermont \"even the foxes seemed to be affected, so that they were\r\nkilled in numbers near the dwellings of the inhabitants;\" and of the\r\nepidemic in 1871 in New York, Dr. Smith relates that \"it was common\r\nand fatal in the large stables of the city car and stage lines, while\r\namong the people the epidemic did not properly commence until January,\r\n1872.\" It would be desirable to learn more precisely the characters of\r\nthese vulpine and equine epidemics before associating them with the\r\ndisease we are studying, the more so that we have been unable to\r\ndiscover a similar relation between any epizoötic and other epidemics\r\nof meningitis. In this connection may be recalled the statement of Dr.\r\nLaw of Dublin, that while he was attending a lady suffering from\r\ncerebro-spinal meningitis \"nine rabbits, out of eleven which her son\r\nhad, died, all in the same way: their limbs seemed to fail them, they\r\nfell on their side, and then worked in convulsions, and died.\" On\r\nexamination of the bodies of several of them congestion of the vessels\r\nof the base of the brain was found, and also \"vascularity of the\r\nmembranes of the spinal marrow, indicating inflammation.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Dublin Quarterly Journ._, May, 1866, p. 298.]\r\n\r\nTYPES.--No disease presents a greater variety--and, indeed,\r\ndissimilarity--of symptoms than epidemic meningitis. Some of its\r\nepidemics are sthenic and even inflammatory in their type, while\r\nothers have the malignant aspect of rapid blood-poisoning. These\r\ncontrasts have been exhibited on a large scale, for while upon the\r\ncontinent of Europe the disease for the most part has presented\r\nsthenic phenomena, it has been more generally asthenic and adynamic in\r\nIreland. One might be inclined to attribute the latter peculiarity to\r\nthe permanent prevalence of typhus fever in the latter country, or\r\nrather to the special causes producing typhus, were it not that in the\r\nUnited States both types of the disease have been observed at\r\ndifferent times and in different places. Such contrasts of type are,\r\nhowever, not unusual in other diseases that occur as epidemics,\r\nincluding not only the eruptive fevers, but inflammations, or\r\naffections involving inflammation, such as pneumonia, dysentery, {805}\r\ndiphtheria, etc. Hence it is evident that certain epidemics, and\r\ncertain cases in each epidemic, may exhibit on the one hand a\r\npredominance of inflammatory, or on the other of adynamic or ataxic,\r\nsymptoms, and each of them in every conceivable degree and\r\ncombination. It is this variation of type that has led to such\r\ndifferent conceptions of the nature of epidemic meningitis, many\r\nphysicians regarding it as a fever, and many others as an\r\ninflammation, while, as we believe, it is both the one and the other,\r\nand acquires from either element, according to its ascendency, the\r\ntypical character of the particular epidemic under observation.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of these statements we may mention in this place the\r\nseveral _forms_ of the disease as they have been seen and interpreted\r\nby different observers. Forget classified them as follows: (_A_)\r\nCEREBRO-SPINAL; 1, _Explosive_ (_foudroyante_); 2,\r\n_Comatose-convulsive_; 3, _Inflammatory_; 4, _Typhoid_; 5,\r\n_Neuralgic_; 6, _Hectic_; 7, _Paralytic_. (_B_) CEREBRAL: 1,\r\n_Cephalalgic_; 2, _Cephalalgic-delirious_; 3, _Delirious_; 4,\r\n_Comatose_. In the first of these divisions three-sevenths belong to\r\nthe first and fourth varieties. But \"there were slight and severe\r\ncases; violent and hectic forms; cerebral symptoms predominant in some\r\nand spinal in others, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIn his excellent paper on the epidemic of 1848 in New Orleans, Ames\r\narranged his cases in two categories--the _Congestive_ and the\r\n_Inflammatory_, subdividing the former into the _Malignant_ and the\r\n_Mild_. Malignant congestive cases were distinguished by prostration,\r\ncoma or delirium, or both; opisthotonos; and a pulse varying extremely\r\nin its degree of frequency. In _mild congestive_ cases a good degree\r\nof strength was preserved; the pulse was below 90; there were marked\r\npain in the head and tenderness of the spine, but no coma, delirium,\r\nor stiffness of any muscles besides those of the neck. The purely\r\n_inflammatory_ cases were, in general, distinguished by a temperature\r\nof the skin above that of health and a full, firm pulse, but the\r\n_malignant inflammatory_ were marked by the early occurrence of\r\ndelirium or coma, great irregularity of pulse, opisthotonos,\r\nconvulsive spasm, strabismus, and occasional amaurosis, with vomiting\r\nand a rapid and fatal course; the _grave_, by a slighter development\r\nof the same symptoms, except coma and delirium; and the _mild_, by a\r\nlower grade of febrile excitement, the preservation of a good degree\r\nof strength, a tendency to become chronic, and by the absence of coma,\r\ndrowsiness, delirium, and a cold stage.\r\n\r\nWunderlich adopted the simple plan of arranging the cases in three\r\ncategories: 1, the _gravest_ and most rapidly fatal cases; 2, the\r\n_less grave_; and 3, the _lightest_. The arrangement of Hirsch had\r\nmore significance, as well as a clinical foundation--viz. 1, the\r\n_abortive_; 2, the _explosive_ (_m. siderans_, the same as _m.\r\nfoudroyante_ of Tourdes); 3, the _intermittent_; 4, the _typhoid_.\r\n\r\nDr. Bedford Brown,[16] who observed the epidemics in North Carolina\r\nfrom 1862 to 1864, arranged the cases under the following heads: 1,\r\nthe _inflammatory_ form, in which the fever is high, the pain very\r\nacute, and the delirium furious, but which is exceedingly rare; 2, the\r\n_neuralgic_ form, which is stated to be the most frequent and\r\nprotracted, with moderate fever and a pulse but slightly accelerated,\r\nand giving a favorable prognosis; 3, the _ataxic_ form, in which great\r\nnervous depression is {806} associated with a low and busy delirium,\r\nand the temperature \"is generally much reduced below the natural\r\nstandard.... This is always a dangerous form;\" 4, the _paralytic_\r\nform, in which stupor and insensibility are early and prominent\r\nfeatures, with a very slow and feeble pulse, blanched skin, and death\r\nby syncope.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Richmond Med. Jour._, ii. 1.]\r\n\r\nDr. Purcell of Cork[17] furnished a classification which is one of the\r\nbest for practical and clinical purposes--viz. 1, the _rapid_ variety,\r\nattended with purple blotches, embarrassed respiration and\r\ncirculation, followed by sopor, insensibility, and coma; 2, the\r\n_cerebro-spinal_ form, with retraction of the head, pain and cramps of\r\nthe muscles, hyperæsthesia of the skin, delirium, etc., accompanied by\r\nfever, herpetic eruptions, etc. These two forms are apt to be more or\r\nless associated in the same case.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Dublin Quarterly Jour._, Aug., 1870, p. 243.]\r\n\r\nOf the various forms admitted by different authors, and of which we\r\nhave seen examples, we would class together--(_a_.) The abortive, in\r\nwhich the characteristic phenomena are often faintly defined, and yet\r\nto the practised eye distinctive. (_b_.) The malignant, in which the\r\nsymptoms, of whatever kind, are exaggerated, the attack sudden, the\r\ncourse short, and the issue fatal. (_c_.) The nervous, including 1,\r\nthe _Ataxic_--viz.--1, the _delirious_; 2, the _cephalalgic_; 3, the\r\n_neuralgic_; 4, the _convulsive_; 5, the _paralytic_; and 6, the\r\n_adynamic_ (_comatose_ and _typhoid_). (_d_.) The inflammatory. (_e_.)\r\nThe intermittent. Of these the _abortive_ and _intermittent_ call for\r\na brief explanation. Abortive meningitis is observed only during the\r\nprevalence of the disease in a more characteristic form. Thus, the\r\nmother of a boy who had died of the fully-developed disease\r\n\"complained of the head and back and limbs, and of chilliness, and\r\npresented a petechial eruption. After active purgative and\r\ncounter-irritant treatment she was about her work on the second\r\nday.\"[18] The late Dr. Burns of Frankford, Philadelphia, while\r\nattending patients affected with the disease suffered from headache,\r\nsevere pains along the spine and in every joint of the body, and a\r\ngeneral languid feeling.[19] Kempf during the decline of an epidemic\r\nobserved \"a great number of individuals, especially adults, who\r\ncomplained of headache, malaise, neuralgic pains in various parts of\r\nthe body, and pain in the nape of the neck or other parts of the\r\nspine.\"[20] In a case observed by the writer (June, 1867) most of the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms were present in a mitigated form, and the\r\npulse was at 60. Within five days restoration was complete.[21] The\r\n_intermittent_ and _remittent_ types are apt to be quotidian or\r\ntertian, and in fatal cases the former has been taken for malignant\r\nintermittent fever, which it resembles by a periodical febrile\r\nmovement, with pains, cramps, delirium, etc. This type sometimes first\r\nmanifests itself during the decline of an attack.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Sargent, _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, July, 1849, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, April, 1865, p. 339.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Ibid._, July, 1866, p. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Epidemic Meningitis_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE SYMPTOMS.--Like other fatal epidemic diseases,\r\nmeningitis is sometimes sudden and sometimes gradual in its\r\ndevelopment. In the former case the patient, who has gone to bed\r\napparently in perfect health, awakes suddenly from a sound sleep about\r\nthe small hours of the night to find himself in a severe chill. In the\r\ncase of young children a convulsion attends the awakening. Or the\r\npatient, while {807} pursuing his ordinary avocations, may be seized\r\nwith a chill, prostration, vomiting, and headache, of which symptoms\r\nthe last is often intensely distressing. In this, as in other epidemic\r\ndiseases, such violent seizures are most common during the earlier\r\nperiods of its prevalence, but later in its course premonitory\r\nsymptoms are more frequently observed. They may last for an hour or\r\ntwo, or may extend to several days; and, in general, it may be stated\r\nthat the longer their duration the milder will be the subsequent\r\nattack. But the symptoms in either case are essentially the\r\nsame--prostration, chilliness, feverishness, and sometimes vomiting\r\nand sharp pains in the head, back, and limbs. The character of the\r\nvomiting, as well as the absence of all gastric lesions in fatal\r\ncases, proves that it is occasioned by an irritation of the central\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nIn the cases which are regularly developed these phenomena more or\r\nless gradually assume a graver aspect or usher in a heavy chill, which\r\nin its turn is followed by alarming symptoms, and especially by an\r\nexcruciating pain in the head, a livid or pale and sunken countenance,\r\nand extreme restlessness. The pulse is as often slow as frequent, and\r\nthe skin is rarely hot, and, indeed, is generally but little, if at\r\nall, warmer than natural. The vague pains that began with the attack\r\nare now concentrated, and seem to dart in every direction from the\r\nspine, which is also, at its upper part, the seat of severe aching;\r\nand in some cases hyperæsthesia of the skin is very marked. In a large\r\nproportion of cases the spinal muscles become more or less rigidly\r\ncontracted, so that the head is drawn backward or the whole trunk is\r\narched as in tetanus. Trismus is not uncommon, and clonic spasms\r\nfrequently affect the limbs. Even general convulsions are occasionally\r\nobserved. As these phenomena grow more decided delirium of various\r\ndegrees is often manifested, from mere wanderings and hallucinations\r\nduring the sleepless watches of the night to violent maniacal ravings\r\nor incoherent mutterings, or the stertor of coma. Frey and others have\r\nnoted a remission of the symptoms occurring on or about the third day\r\nin cases of a regular type. The rigidity of the cervical muscles\r\nbecomes relaxed, the headache subsides, and the mental condition\r\nimproves. But this amelioration lasts but a short time, and then the\r\nnormal course of the symptoms is resumed.\r\n\r\nAs the attack advances the pulse gradually or rapidly rises above the\r\nnormal rate, and sometimes becomes very frequent, and the skin,\r\nalthough it grows warmer, does not often acquire the temperature\r\nobserved in idiopathic fevers or sustain it as they do. In many cases\r\neruptions appear upon the skin. During some epidemics the only one\r\nobserved is herpes labialis; in others the eruption resembles roseola,\r\nmeasles, or the mulberry rash of typhus, or from the first it consists\r\nof petechiæ, vibices, or extensive ecchymoses. The tongue presents the\r\ncharacters which belong generally to the typhoid state. At first moist\r\nand coated with a whitish fur or a mucous secretion, it afterward, if\r\nlife is prolonged, grows red and shining or brown and fuliginous.\r\nThere is usually a complete loss of appetite, and the thirst is not\r\ncommonly urgent. One or two liquid stools at the commencement are\r\ngenerally followed by constipation, which continues throughout the\r\nattack, although in very grave and protracted cases diarrhoea may\r\npersist, and even become colliquative. When the attack tends to a\r\nfatal issue the patient generally, but by no means always, sinks into\r\na soporose condition, in which {808} muscular relaxation, debility,\r\nand tremulousness, such as are common in the typhoid state of fevers,\r\nare associated with paralysis of the sphincters and of other muscles.\r\nBut we have seen rigid opisthotonos continue until within a few hours\r\nof death in a case of more than the average duration.\r\n\r\nIn cases that tend toward recovery the typhoid condition is rarely so\r\ngrave, but patients have often survived very severe nervous symptoms.\r\nIt is true that the return to health may be tedious and uncertain, and\r\nnot unusually a perfect restoration of all the functions is very long\r\ndelayed, or, it may be, is never attained.\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL SYMPTOMS.--Pain in the head is one of the most\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of epidemic meningitis. It is always present,\r\nexcept in those malignant cases in which the morbid poison seems to\r\nspend its fatal power upon the blood. In some, however, of a less\r\nrapid but still malignant type, in which after death no exudation is\r\nfound, but only an extreme venous congestion of the membranes, or it\r\nmay be an effusion of blood beneath them, this symptom may be more or\r\nless marked. It is generally an excruciating pain, sometimes darting\r\napparently through the head from the nuchæ to the forehead, extorting\r\ncries and groans, and is variously described by the sufferers as\r\nthrobbing, boring, lancinating, sharp, or crushing, \"as if the head\r\nwere in a vice or nails or screws were being forced into the brain.\"\r\nIts paroxysms arouse the patient from his apathetic stupor or his\r\ncoma, and cause him to become restless or violent or to shriek with\r\nagony. Even when this evidence of anguish is wanting the patient often\r\nattests his suffering by contortions or cries, or by frequently\r\ncarrying his hands to his head. That it depends upon mechanical\r\npressure upon the sensitive ganglia within the cranium and upper part\r\nof the spine is shown by the relief which revulsive and\r\ncounter-irritant measures afford when applied to the occipital region\r\nand the back of the neck. Identical in cause and quality with this\r\npain is the spinal pain proper. No better description of it has been\r\ngiven than that of Fiske in 1810. It is in these words: \"Its bold and\r\nprominent features defy comparison.... In some a pain resembling the\r\nsensation felt from the stinging of a bee seizes the extremity of a\r\nfinger or toe; from thence it darts to the foot or hand or some other\r\npart of the limbs, sometimes in the joints and sometimes in the\r\nmuscles, carrying a numbness or prickling sensation in its progress.\r\nAfter traversing the extremities, generally of one side only, it\r\nseizes the head, and flies with the rapidity and sensation of\r\nelectricity over the whole body, occasioning blindness, faintings,\r\nsickness at the stomach, with indescribable distress about the\r\npræcordia--a numbness or partial loss of motion in one or both limbs\r\non one side, with great prostration of strength. The horrible\r\nsensation of this process no language can describe.\"[22] These spinal\r\npains are always aggravated by pressure made on either side of the\r\nspinous processes of the vertebræ, and, like the cephalic pains, are\r\nmore or less mitigated by revulsive applications. Accompanying the\r\npains is a hyperæsthesia or morbid sensibility of the skin, rendering\r\nit painfully sensitive to the slightest touch; in the advanced stages\r\nof the disease, when the spinal phenomena predominate, the irritation\r\nof the nerves by the pressure of the exudation on their roots is\r\nexchanged for numbness or {809} absolute insensibility, due to the\r\nincrease and continuance of that pressure. Moving the limbs or\r\nseparating the closed eyelids will sometimes provoke resistance, and\r\neven extort cries; and especially is this true of attempts to\r\nstraighten the rigidly bent spine or the flexed extremities. Lewis\r\nstates that such outcries were so often excited by slowly introducing\r\nthe thermometer into the rectum that he was forced to believe that the\r\nanal and perhaps the rectal surface was hypersensitive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: North, on _Spotted Fever_, p. 176.]\r\n\r\nThe physical causes that give rise to the pains which have just been\r\ndescribed likewise occasion the spasmodic and tetanoid phenomena that\r\nare so peculiar to this disease. In general terms, they are most\r\nmarked in cases attended with inflammatory exudation, and least so\r\nwhen, instead of this lesion, there is only vascular congestion of the\r\nmeninges of the spinal cord. But the rule is, of course, not absolute,\r\nfor individuals are so differently constituted that one will remain\r\nimpassive under an irritation that will throw another into\r\nconvulsions. There is no doubt that spinal rigidity may be produced by\r\nmere congestion of the cord, and, on the other hand, that it may be\r\nabsent even when plastic exudation is abundant. This symptom is,\r\nhowever, more than any other one, characteristic of the disease. It\r\nexisted in the original epidemic at Geneva, attracted the attention of\r\nthe earliest American observers of the disease, and elsewhere has\r\nmarked a greater or a smaller proportion of the cases in every\r\nepidemic. It was described by such terms as these: \"a drawing-back of\r\nthe head;\" \"a corpse-like rigidity of the limbs;\" \"the form of tetanus\r\ncalled opisthotonos;\" \"spastic rigidity of the muscles of the lower\r\njaw and the posterior muscles of the neck;\" \"rigidity of the posterior\r\ncervical muscles, retracting the head considerably backward.\" The\r\nhistorians of the disease in Europe are, if possible, still more\r\nemphatic in their elaborate descriptions of this phenomenon, and, on\r\nthe Continent at least, it seems to have been more uniformly present\r\nthan it was in Ireland or in this country. Tourdes, in describing the\r\nepidemic of 1842 at Strasburg, said: \"The decubitus of the sick was\r\ndistinguished by a backward flexion of the head and spine; most\r\nfrequently the neck alone was affected, but sometimes the whole trunk\r\nwas arched.\" And again: \"The contraction often involved all of the\r\nextensor muscles of the spine, and the trunk formed an arch opening\r\nbackward and resting upon the occiput and sacrum.\" In Ireland, Gordon\r\nsays of a patient, \"Her spine presented a most wonderful uniform curve\r\nconcave backward; her head was also curved backward on the spine of\r\nthe neck.\" During an epidemic at Birmingham in 1875 in one case \"the\r\nretraction was so marked that a slough formed from the occiput\r\npressing between the scapulæ.\"[23] In some cases rigid flexion of the\r\nbody forward or laterally has been noticed. The rigidity persists, as\r\na rule, until death, but sometimes ceases a short time before that\r\nevent. If recovery takes place, this symptom gradually subsides, and\r\ndisappears within a few days; but, on the other hand, more or less\r\nstiffness of the spine may last for several weeks. In one case it\r\ncontinued for more than two months, and in another until death on the\r\nforty-ninth day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Hart, _St. Bart's Rep._, iv. 141.]\r\n\r\nThe same physical cause that occasions rigidity, when acting less\r\nintensely or when a special susceptibility of the nervous system\r\nexists, also excites clonic convulsions. They are oftenest observed in\r\npatients of the {810} age especially liable to spasmodic\r\naffections--in children before the completion of the first dentition.\r\nThey vary in degree from twitching or subsultus affecting particular\r\nmuscles, as of the eyes, the face, a limb, etc., to general\r\nepileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness. They may be\r\nassociated with paralysis, as where the two halves of the body are,\r\nthe one convulsed and the other paralyzed. A case occurred in Dublin\r\nwhich \"presented the very striking phenomenon of continued and violent\r\nconvulsions during the whole of the brief course of the illness.\"[24]\r\nThese convulsions, like others occurring at the commencement of acute\r\ndiseases, are by no means always fatal, even when they are general. In\r\nthe case of a robust adult convulsions occurred repeatedly during the\r\nfirst two days, and less frequently during the two following days, but\r\nthe patient ultimately recovered.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, xlvi. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Boston Med. and Surg. Jour._, Feb., 1884, p. 121.]\r\n\r\nParalysis, it may be inferred from the statements already made, is an\r\nincident of this disease, for an excess of the action causing tonic or\r\nclonic spasm must induce paralysis. Paralysis of an arm or leg or of\r\nthe muscles of deglutition was long ago noticed among even the initial\r\nsymptoms of the attack. In Dublin (1865) it was said of a patient,\r\n\"All his members seemed to be paralyzed; he could move neither arms\r\nnor legs.\" Wunderlich describes the case of a man who \"on the second\r\nday of the disease lost both sensibility and motility in the lower\r\nlimbs and over the greater part of the trunk, while his left arm also\r\nwas partially paralyzed.\" In another case complete paralysis of the\r\nright side occurred on the third day, the left side being rigid.[26]\r\nBaxa relates the case of a soldier in whom paralysis of the left side\r\npersisted after recovery from the disease,[27] and that of a woman in\r\nwhom paralysis of the left lower limb continued along with right\r\nciliary paralysis. Ptosis, strabismus, paralysis of the bladder and\r\nrectum, of the muscles of deglutition, and even general paralysis,\r\nhave been observed. Aphasia also has been recorded by Hirsch and by\r\nHayden.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, 1867, p. 431.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Wiener med. Presse_, No. 29, p. 715.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, xlvi. 187.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the eyes and of vision in this disease is directly\r\ndue to pressure of the exudation at the base of the brain upon the\r\nnerves and blood-vessels that supply these organs. One of the most\r\nstriking peculiarities of the countenance of a patient at the\r\nbeginning of an attack is the diffused and uniform redness of the\r\nconjunctivæ. In children it has a light tint, but a darker one in\r\nadults, and in some cases the eye becomes suffused with an\r\nextravasation of blood. The conditions of the pupil are also very\r\npeculiar. Very long ago it was observed to undergo sudden changes from\r\ncontraction to dilatation, or the reverse. Dilatation is, however, its\r\nordinary condition, especially in the fully-formed attack. Very often\r\nthe pupils of the two eyes are in opposite states. In cases of long\r\nduration, with great exhaustion, they are almost invariably dilated.\r\nPhotophobia is not uncommon, and oscillation of the pupils and\r\nspasmodic movements of the eyeball have frequently been observed.\r\nStrabismus is a symptom of very ordinary occurrence, particularly when\r\nother paralytic or spasmodic phenomena exist. It may be convergent or\r\ndivergent, but most commonly is the former, and may be either a\r\ntransient or a {811} permanent symptom. Like other individual\r\nsymptoms, it may be present rarely or frequently in a particular\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\nBlindness has been repeatedly observed. At first it seemed to be\r\nnoticed as a transient symptom only. Fish (1809) states that it was\r\nsometimes the first deviation from health, and then was followed by\r\nparalytic spinal symptoms. He also observed that sight was sometimes\r\nrestored in a few hours, and in no case did he know it to be\r\npermanently lost. American as well as European physicians, however,\r\nhave met with many cases in which the sight was seriously and\r\npermanently impaired or altogether destroyed. In 1873 the changes\r\naffecting the eye were more fully and accurately described, especially\r\nthose which tend to the structural injury of the organ. The abnormal\r\nappearances included cloudiness of the media, discoloration of the\r\niris, irregularity of the pupils, and their obstruction with exudate.\r\nIn exceptional cases the cornea ulcerated, and the globe collapsed\r\nafter losing its contents. Ordinarily, however, says Lewis, \"no\r\nulceration occurs, and as the patient convalesces the oedema of the\r\nlids, the hyperæmia of the conjunctiva, the cloudiness of the cornea\r\nand of the humors gradually abate, and the exudation in the pupils is\r\nabsorbed. The iris bulges forward, and the deep tissues of the eye,\r\nviewed through the vitreous humor, which had a dusky color from\r\nhyperæmia, now present a dull white color. The lens itself, at first\r\ntransparent, after a while becomes cataractous, and sight is lost\r\ntotally and for ever.\"\r\n\r\nImpairment or loss of hearing has been occasionally observed during\r\nthe successive epidemics of this disease, even from the beginning of\r\nits history, and it was early noticed that the symptom was often quite\r\nindependent of any cognizable lesion of the ear itself. It was also\r\nobserved that the sense of smell sometimes became impaired or was lost\r\nat the same time with that of hearing. More recently, Collins reported\r\na case in which the patient lost the sight of one eye and became\r\npermanently deaf in both ears. Knapp states that in all of thirty-one\r\ncases examined by him the deafness was bilateral, and, with two\r\nexceptions of faint perception of sound, complete. Among twenty-nine\r\ncases of total deafness only one seemed to give some evidence of\r\nhearing afterward.[29] This surgeon holds that the deafness results\r\nfrom a purulent inflammation of the labyrinth, and his judgment has\r\nbeen confirmed by Keller and Lucas. When the impairment of hearing\r\noccurs simultaneously, or nearly so, in both ears, it is probable that\r\nthe chief cause of the deafness is the pressure of the plastic\r\nexudation in which the auditory nerve is imbedded. Such deafness is\r\nrarely permanent. When the loss of hearing, whether complete or\r\npartial, does not improve, there is reason to believe that the\r\ninternal ear has suffered great and incurable changes of structure.\r\nSometimes this follows a distinct attack of suppurative inflammation\r\nof the middle ear; but as complete and permanent deafness sometimes\r\noccurs without being preceded by any such affection, it must be\r\ninferred that atrophic changes have taken place in some portion of the\r\nnervous apparatus of hearing. It is stated by Moos that of sixty-four\r\ncases of recovery from cerebro-spinal meningitis, which showed\r\ndisturbance of hearing as a sequel, one-half manifested in addition a\r\nmore less disordered equilibrium. Of these twenty-nine were totally\r\ndeaf on both sides, two totally deaf on one and hard of hearing on the\r\nother side, and one case had merely {812} impaired hearing in both\r\nears. The disturbance of locomotion had existed for periods varying\r\nfrom three weeks to five years from the inception of the disease, and\r\nwas chiefly characterized by a staggering or waddling gait.[30] In the\r\ndeaf-mute institutions at Bamberg and Nürnberg it is said that out of\r\n91 pupils, 80 owed their infirmity to this disease (Ziemssen). Salamo\r\nstates that some awake out of sleep totally deaf, and remain so for a\r\nlong time, or, it may be, permanently (Moos).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Smith, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Mening. Cerebro-spinal epid._, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe expression of countenance in this disease is peculiar. When the\r\npain in the head is severe and paroxysmal the features are apt to be\r\nviolently distorted; when it is more persistent the face assumes a\r\nfixed or rigid expression, or is at the same time dull, particularly\r\nafter a long continuance of the pain. In the apoplectic form the\r\nexpression may be set and stupid, but the features have neither the\r\ndark, dull, swollen, and duskily-flushed aspect of typhus, nor the\r\nlanguid, sleepy expression, and circumscribed flush on the cheek which\r\nare so characteristic of typhoid fever. Except during absolute\r\ninsensibility in rapidly fatal cases there is a look of greater\r\nintelligence than belongs to either of the diseases mentioned. Indeed,\r\nin the beginning of the attack in regular cases the distinctive facies\r\npresents pale and sunken features, with paleness of the skin over the\r\nwhole body.\r\n\r\nDelirium in this disease exhibits a great many degrees and varieties.\r\nIt may occur among the earliest symptoms in certain rapid cases not of\r\nthe congestive type, but is more apt to arise on the second or third\r\nday in those more typically developed. It may be mild, reasoning,\r\nhysterical, or maniacal, or it may change from one to another of these\r\nforms during the same attack. Fish states that it is apt to be violent\r\nif it comes on at the commencement of the illness, but that when it\r\nbegins at a later period it is milder, and sometimes playful, the\r\npatient being sociable and humorous. All good observers have furnished\r\nsimilar descriptions of this symptom; some have added that the mental\r\ncondition is often desponding and apprehensive, and others that\r\ncertain patients remain sombre and silent; and it sometimes happens\r\nthat the delirium comes on abruptly, as when a patient \"woke suddenly\r\nin the middle of the night and began to hum tunes, to fancy that\r\npeople were conversing with him,\" etc. (Gordon).\r\n\r\nComa is met with sooner or later in nearly all fatal cases, but rarely\r\nin a marked degree until the approach of death. If anything is\r\nsurprising in epidemic meningitis, it is the absence of that deep and\r\nprolonged stupor that characterizes the typhoid state, notwithstanding\r\nthe pressure of the exudation upon the brain in most cases, and in\r\nothers such a profound alteration of the blood that it exudes through\r\nthe tissues as water passes through a porous body. Another striking\r\nphenomenon of the disease is that the patient after recovery has\r\ngenerally a complete oblivion of all that happened to him between the\r\nbeginning of the attack and convalescence. This is true even of cases\r\nin which the brain symptoms are far from being conspicuous.\r\n\r\nAnother symptom closely related to the local lesion and the\r\nblood-change in this disease is vertigo. As originally described by\r\nMiner in 1823, it occurred from the very commencement of the attack,\r\nand was even then regarded as denoting a deficient supply of the blood\r\nto the {813} brain, so that when the patient rose to an erect posture\r\nit was felt along with uneasiness in the stomach, acceleration of the\r\npulse, dimness of sight, nausea, and fainting. Tourdes, speaking of it\r\nas it occurred in the Strasburg epidemic, says that it confused the\r\nmind and rendered walking impossible. In two cases patients were\r\nseized with a giddiness which compelled them to whirl around, when\r\nthey fell and did not rise again. According to Moos (1881) unilateral\r\naffections of the labyrinth give rise to vertigo, and bilateral\r\nlesions to a staggering gait. Bilateral hemorrhage or acute\r\nsuppuration of the ampullar terminations of the auditory nerve\r\noccasions paralysis and staggering. Children, and those who at the\r\nsame time have the sight impaired, are apt to remain affected for a\r\nlong time. Otherwise, prolonged and systematic muscular exercise may\r\nremove the tottering walk.\r\n\r\nTo the same causes must doubtless be attributed the debility which is\r\nso early and so conspicuous a symptom in this disease, and which gave\r\nit one of the names, typhus syncopalis, by which it was first known in\r\nthis country. It was manifested by the vertigo already noticed, by a\r\nsense of sinking in the epigastrium, by a quick, frequent, feeble, and\r\nirregular pulse, and by a sudden and extreme loss of muscular power,\r\nso that the patient found himself unable to raise his hand before he\r\nwas sensible of being ill. This state of asthenia is conspicuous\r\nthroughout the whole of the disease, and is the immediate cause of the\r\nslow and irregular convalescence which is characteristic of it.\r\n\r\nOf the symptoms peculiar to the digestive apparatus hardly any belong\r\nto it directly. They are nearly all the effect of reflex influences.\r\nThe condition of the tongue is for the most part quite unlike that\r\nwhich belongs to the typhoid state. The fuliginous condition of the\r\ntongue, gums, cheeks, and lips which characterizes that state is\r\nseldom met with in epidemic meningitis. The older writers agreed that\r\neven when the tongue does grow dry and brown the condition is not of\r\nlong continuance, and later observers have confirmed their statements.\r\nThus, J. L. Smith (1872) says, \"Occasionally, in cases attended with\r\ngreat prostration, the fur of the tongue is dry and brown, but only\r\nfor a few days, when the moist whitish fur succeeds.\" We have\r\ngenerally found it moist, whitish in the centre and at the tip and\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nNausea and vomiting are very constant among the initial symptoms of\r\nthe disease, and, as already pointed out, are due to irritation of the\r\ncerebro-spinal ganglia. Very often the vomiting is not preceded by\r\nnausea, and is brought on by the patient's raising himself, etc. The\r\nstomach itself undergoes no change. Both symptoms are usually\r\naccompanied by faintness or giddiness, and are more decided in the\r\ninitial than in the later stages of the attack. The matters vomited,\r\nvarying with the contents of the stomach and the urgency and duration\r\nof the symptom, consist of ingesta, mucus, serum, or bile, and in some\r\ngrave cases of a dark grumous matter taken to be altered blood. In\r\nsome epidemics, apparently, more than in others, this symptom is very\r\ndistressing, as it was at Birmingham in 1875.[31] The inability of the\r\nstomach to retain food necessarily leads to a rapid wasting of the\r\nflesh, which is aggravated by the patient's suffering, restlessness,\r\nand want of sleep. Nevertheless, no sooner is the vomiting appeased\r\nthan a desire for food is felt, and when {814} it is retained it\r\ngenerally undergoes digestion. Indeed, in no other disease is the\r\nreturn of a good appetite and digestion so prompt and complete. It is\r\ntrue that the recovery of flesh and strength is not always in\r\nproportion to the appetite. As might be expected in a disease in which\r\nfever plays so subordinate a part, there is seldom urgent thirst. But\r\nepidemics differ in this as in so many other respects. In that which\r\nwe witnessed in the Philadelphia Hospital in 1866-67 the patients were\r\nclamorous for liquids. Constipation is the rule among patients with\r\nthis disease, as, indeed, might naturally be expected, for no lesion\r\naffects the bowels and little or no food is retained by the stomach.\r\nYet in a few cases diarrhoea accompanies persistent vomiting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Hart, _St. Bart's Rep._, xii. 112.]\r\n\r\nThe fauces appear to have been more or less inflamed in some\r\nepidemics; swelling of the parotid glands is an occasional occurrence,\r\nand sometimes they undergo suppuration. Aphthæ have also been met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe secretion of urine is not affected in any uniform manner.\r\nSometimes it is diminished and sometimes increased in quantity. The\r\nlatter symptom has occasionally long survived the disease. It retains\r\nits normal acidity. In rare cases either albumen or sugar has been\r\ndetected; the former may have been due to the action of blisters of\r\ncantharides used in the treatment of the disease.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and unintelligible phenomena occasionally met\r\nwith in this disease is a peculiar affection of the joints, which\r\nfirst was observed in this country. Jackson (1810 and 1813) wrote: \"In\r\nsome cases swellings have occurred in the joints and limbs. They have\r\nbeen very sore to the touch, and their appearance has been compared to\r\nthat of the gout. The parts so affected feel as if they had been\r\nbruised. These swellings arise on the smaller as well as on the larger\r\njoints, and are often of a purple color.\" So Collins[32] reports: \"The\r\njoints sometimes become swollen, red, and tender; at other times red\r\nand painful without any swelling; while, again, intense pain and rapid\r\nenlargement from effusion have occurred unattended with redness. The\r\njoints most usually attacked are the knee, elbow, wrist, and the\r\nsmaller articulations of the fingers and toes.\" In an epidemic which\r\noccurred in Greece in 1869 articular swellings similar to those of\r\ninflammatory rheumatism were observed.[33] These descriptions, which\r\napply to some cases in most epidemics, are of more than casual\r\ninterest, for they demonstrate conclusively, as we think, the truth\r\nwhich the whole history of the disease confirms--viz. that it is a\r\nsystemic and not a local affection, and is dependent for its existence\r\nupon a specific poison which is absolutely unlike every other morbid\r\npoison known to pathology.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, Aug., 1868, p. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Archives générales de med._, Mai, 1883, p. 622.]\r\n\r\nThe act of respiration is variously modified in this disease, as\r\nmight, indeed, be expected from the seat and nature of the\r\ncerebro-spinal lesions. It is sighing, labored, and interrupted.\r\nBurdon-Sanderson describes its differences from the so-called\r\nCheyne-Stokes respiration; it is, he says, \"marked by a slow, labored\r\ninspiration, followed by a quick expiration and a long pause.\" When\r\nopisthotonos is very great and persistent, it necessarily interferes\r\nwith the dilatation of the lungs, and leads to oedema of those organs,\r\nand even to sanguineous effusions into them. {815} Pneumonia is not an\r\nunusual complication of the disease when it prevails in cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characters of the pulse are diminished force and\r\nvolume, and a tone so much impaired that slight causes produce extreme\r\nvariations in its rate and rhythm. If the disease be a fever, as is by\r\nsome maintained, then it is the only fever in which the pulse-rate is\r\noften far below the normal, and at the same time neither full nor\r\ntense, unless transiently and in altogether exceptional cases. In no\r\nother disease attended with inflammation do the rate and quality of\r\nthe pulse vary so greatly within short intervals. It may be said, in\r\ngeneral terms, to be variable in rate and strength even in the most\r\nsthenic cases of the disease, and in those which tend to a fatal issue\r\nto be small, thready, weak, intermittent, or imperceptible for a\r\nlonger or shorter time before death. It is no uncommon thing for the\r\npulse-rate at the beginning of an attack to fall as low as 40, or even\r\n27, and afterward rise to 120 or even more, in a minute, without\r\nnecessarily indicating a fatal issue. Muscular exertion, rising from a\r\nrecumbent posture, etc., will sometimes double its frequency, besides\r\nproducing irregularity. Read, describing the pulse as he observed it\r\nin Boston in 1873-74, speaks of cases in which \"both the rhythm and\r\nthe force of the beats are entirely destroyed; ... one moment, while\r\nbeating very fast, it will suddenly drop to a much lower rate....\r\nThese conditions also may outlast apparent convalescence.\" Some fatal\r\ncases are attended by distressing palpitations of the heart.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable in the early histories of this affection\r\nthan their unanimous statement that it is not distinguished by a\r\nfebrile temperature. It is true that the observers of those days had\r\nnot the advantage of using clinical thermometers, but they were too\r\nnearly agreed in their judgments and harmonious in their descriptions\r\nto permit any serious doubt of the substantial accuracy of their\r\nconclusions, which were expressed in such terms as these: \"A\r\ndiminution of heat may be considered as among this most striking\r\nsymptoms of this disease\" (Strong); or, \"the temperature never\r\nexceeded the standard of health in more than three or four cases, ...\r\nand a great majority of the patients had no fever at all\" (Miner); or,\r\nagain, \"A high febrile movement took place only in a limited number\"\r\n(Gilchrist); or, \"The heat of the surface was less in all cases than\r\nis usually observed in acute diseases\" (Jenks). It will be observed\r\nthat these statements, and very many others which agree with them,\r\nwere founded upon the perception of the patients' temperature by the\r\nhand, which was of course applied to the most accessible parts of the\r\nbody--the face, neck, arms, and hands--but they have more real value\r\nand significance than the more recent measurements taken in the mouth,\r\naxilla, rectum, or vagina, for we know that, however valuable the\r\ntemperatures of these parts may be for comparative studies, they do\r\nnot really indicate the condition of the individual who presents them.\r\nIt is a familiar fact that the difference of temperature in cholera\r\nwhen taken in the rectum and the axilla may be 4° F., or even more\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nSince the thermometer has been used in the study of epidemic\r\nmeningitis greater accuracy of results has been attained, and yet the\r\ngeneral statements of the earlier observers have been confirmed. Thus,\r\nGithens has shown that the temperature of the body in this disease is\r\nlower than that recorded of any other fever or inflammatory affection;\r\nthe average, {816} indeed, of his cases was lower by four or five\r\ndegrees than that of typhus or typhoid fever, pneumonia, etc. In 2\r\ncases only did the thermometer in the axilla reach 105°. The highest\r\ntemperature in 15 cases was between 104° and 105°; in 12, between 103°\r\nand 104°; in 7, between 102° and 103°; in 6, between 101° and 102°;\r\nand in 2 it was below 100°.[34] Tourdes, Niemeyer, and others have\r\nnoted the slight rise of temperature during the first and second days\r\nof the attack, and Wunderlich found fever of very unequal degrees and\r\nwith very variable maxima, but the highest temperatures were observed\r\nby him as well as others in fatal cases and immediately before death.\r\nIn one instance it reached 107.5° F. Burdon-Sanderson and others have\r\nfound that an increased temperature always attended exacerbations of\r\npain. Von Ziemssen gives the average temperature as varying from\r\n100.4° to 103° F., but with variations between higher and lower\r\npoints, and particularly notes the persistence of a normal temperature\r\nwhile the other symptoms are undergoing a variety of changes, as well\r\nas the fact that, unlike other febrile affections, this disease has no\r\nrepresentative temperature curve. In his clinical observations Hart\r\nfound for several successive days as much as six degrees of difference\r\nbetween the morning and evening temperatures. A morning rise for\r\nseveral days was noticed in four cases, and usually there was no\r\nrelation between the pulse and the temperature, nor any uniformly\r\nbetween the temperature and the gravity of the attack.[35] But not\r\nrarely it has been noticed that the daily exacerbations, if any, did\r\nnot occur in the afternoon, but with great irregularity, so that the\r\nmaxima and minima might occur on successive days and at the same hour\r\nof the day. Dr. J. L. Smith, whose thermometric observations in this\r\ndisease seem to have been carefully made, used the thermometer in the\r\nrectum, and thus obtained temperatures higher that the average of\r\nother observations, such as 105.4/6° to 107.2/6° in several cases. Yet\r\nhe found the fluctuations of rectal temperature remarkable, though\r\nless so than the surface temperature, of which he states that\r\nsometimes it rose above or fell below the normal standard several\r\ntimes in the course of the same day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, July, 1867, p. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _St. Bart's Reports_, xii. 112.]\r\n\r\nNothing can be more irregular, uncertain, or various than the\r\neruptions and other cutaneous symptoms that have been met with in this\r\ndisease. When it first appeared in New England a large proportion of\r\nthe cases, and especially of the grave cases, exhibited petechial\r\neruptions and ecchymotic spots, whence the disease presently received\r\nthe name of spotted fever. Yet even then, North and the other\r\nhistorians of its epidemics were careful to state that spots on the\r\nskin were by no means characteristic of the disease, and very often\r\nwere not present at all, especially in cases that terminated\r\nfavorably. Woodward, for example, wrote (1808): \"An eruption on the\r\nskin so seldom appeared that it could no longer be considered a\r\ncharacteristic symptom of the disease.\" In various American local\r\nepidemics an eruption of some kind seems to have existed in about\r\none-half of the cases. In one that we observed in the Philadelphia\r\nHospital no eruption whatever was observed in thirty-seven out of\r\nninety-eight cases. In the epidemic at Chicago in 1872, N. S. Davis\r\nsays:[36] \"About one-third of the cases presented some red\r\nerythematous spots\" between the third and the seventh day. In mild\r\ncases they were few and {817} bright red; in grave cases, darker and\r\nlarger, with some swelling of the skin; and in the worst cases, purple\r\nspots one or two or more inches in diameter. In that of\r\nLouisville,[37] Larrabie states that the eruption \"was generally\r\nherpetic in its character, and accompanied by sudamina; but in several\r\ninstances an urticarious eruption suddenly appeared and disappeared.\"\r\nNothing is said of petechiæ or ecchymoses. In the New York epidemic of\r\n1873[38] the skin in grave cases presented dusky mottlings, especially\r\nwhen the animal temperature was reduced; also a punctated red\r\neruption, bluish spots a few lines in diameter, and large patches of\r\nthe same color. Herpes also was common. It is chiefly in cases of a\r\nmalignant type and rapid and fatal course that ecchymoses have been\r\nobserved. Of this statement illustrations will be given in the\r\nparagraph relating to the duration of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Louisville Med. Jour._, June, 1872, p. 705.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Louisville Med. Jour._, Dec., 1872, p. 782.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, Oct., 1873, p. 329.]\r\n\r\nIn continental European epidemics of meningitis the proportion of\r\ncases in which a general eruption existed seems to have been smaller\r\nthan it was in this country. In the Geneva epidemic of 1805 a\r\nconsiderable number of cases at the point of death presented purplish\r\nspots, some earlier than this, and some after death only. In the\r\nNeapolitan epidemic of 1833, and in that which occurred in Dublin in\r\n1867-68, ecchymoses were often present, and in a very marked degree.\r\nStokes and Banks mention that in some rare instances the spots ran\r\ntogether and coalesced over some portions of the body, so as to cover\r\na large extent of the skin and render it completely black, as though\r\nit were wrapped in some dark shroud. The entire right arm and half of\r\nthe right side of the chest in one case, and in the other the whole of\r\nthe lower portion of one leg and foot, were thus affected.[39] In\r\nStrasburg, on the other hand, only three cases of petechiæ were\r\nobserved by Tourdes; at Rochefort and Versailles, in 1839, they were\r\nrarely noticed; at Gibraltar, in 1844, they do not seem to have been\r\nobserved; in 1848-49, at the Val de Grâce Hospital (Paris), they\r\nappear not to have attracted attention; and at Petit Bourg they were\r\nnot noticed, although the state of the skin was fully described. In\r\nPrussia, in 1865, neither Burdon-Sanderson nor Wunderlich mentions\r\npetechiæ or vibices as occurring during life; and Hirsch, after noting\r\ntheir occasional presence, is obliged to draw upon American authors\r\nfor an account of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, xlvi. 199.]\r\n\r\nOf the eruptions other than petechiæ and ecchymoses, several of which\r\nhave already been mentioned, it is necessary to take some notice here.\r\nThey are, chiefly, and in general terms, exanthems, including\r\nerythema, roseola, and urticaria, and in addition herpes, particularly\r\nof the lips. The last has no special relation to this affection, as it\r\nis met with in almost every febrile disease, but it has sometimes\r\nextended to the whole face in this one. The former may be connected\r\npathologically either with the altered condition of the blood or with\r\nthe irritation produced by the exudation in the spinal nervous\r\ncentres. They have frequently been compared to measles and to\r\nscarlatina, but sometimes they have assumed the form of bullæ. Thus,\r\nin the case of a child four years old, described by Grimshaw,[40] an\r\neruption of pemphigus occurred over the whole body. Jackson long\r\nbefore had mentioned, as one of the eruptions belonging to this\r\ndisease, \"large bullæ, as if produced by cantharides.\" Jenks {818}\r\ndescribed \"large elevated spots of a very dark color, presenting\r\noutside of the dark color a blistered appearance.\" In some cases\r\ngangrene of the skin has been observed when the spots have been\r\nexceptionally dark, and occasionally has been produced by pressure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Jour. of Cutaneous Med._, ii. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of death in many of the more rapid cases is coma, which is\r\noften preceded by convulsions, especially in children; but in many\r\nothers, even when attended with all the marks of dissolution of the\r\nblood, consciousness may be but slightly impaired until the actual\r\nimminence of death. In many other cases, which are fatal in the midst\r\nof an attack with spinal symptoms, death is due to asphyxia, partly\r\nowing to pressure on the medulla oblongata, and partly to the\r\ninterference with the respiratory act due to this pressure, and\r\noccasioning excessive bronchial secretion. Again, death may occur\r\nthrough a gradual exhaustion of the powers of life, without marked\r\nspasm, blood-change, or complication. In these cases also the\r\nintelligence remains unimpaired almost until the moment of\r\ndissolution. Death is not very rarely due to pneumonia, and when the\r\ndisease is greatly prolonged or the convalescence from it is imperfect\r\na fatal termination by dropsy of the brain is still among its dangers.\r\n\r\nHirsch once declared that the duration of epidemic meningitis \"is\r\nbetween a few hours and several months,\" and, however hyperbolical the\r\nphrase may seem, it is quite accurate. Such inequalities are more\r\ncharacteristic of acute blood diseases than of inflammations, and in\r\nthis case the coexistence of elements of both kinds doubtless accounts\r\nfor the extreme irregularity of the symptoms and duration of the\r\nattack. The early American writers insisted strongly on this as a\r\ncharacteristic feature of the disease. They record an unusually large\r\nproportion of cases that were fatal within the first day, and even\r\nafter an illness of five hours, although they agree that the most\r\nusual date of death was between the fourth and seventh days--a result\r\nthat has been confirmed by subsequent observation. Dr. N. S. Davis\r\ngives the duration of the disease, as seen by him, as between twenty\r\nhours and twenty-eight days. Out of 469 fatal cases in the city of New\r\nYork in 1872, 334 are said to have terminated within eleven days, and\r\nof this number 270 were fatal in the first six days of the attack,\r\nincluding 52 who died on the first day, and 51 in from one to two\r\ndays. It is perhaps worthy of note that while from the eleventh to the\r\nfourteenth day only 11 deaths occurred, 20 took place on the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth; and while from the fifteenth to the\r\ntwenty-first day only 16 died, yet from the twenty-first to the\r\ntwenty-second 12 deaths were reported. This would seem to indicate a\r\npeculiar danger on the days represented by multiples of seven. Of\r\ncases that recover, the duration is even more indefinite than that of\r\nfatal cases, owing to complications that occur in many, and especially\r\nsuch as involve the cerebro-spinal centres. When death takes place\r\nwithin a few hours it usually, if not always, is attended with\r\nsymptoms that denote a disorganization of the blood. In 1864 we\r\nattended a young man previously in perfect health, but who died in\r\ntwenty-one hours after the first seizure. His mind was unclouded\r\nthroughout his brief but fatal illness. Within seven hours of death a\r\npurpurous discoloration of the skin began, and about an hour before\r\nthat event the surface everywhere assumed a dusky hue. The forearms\r\nand hands were almost uniformly purple and the face turgid; many\r\necchymotic spots on the trunk and lower limbs were nearly black and\r\nmeasured {819} one or two inches in diameter.[41] In the case of a\r\nchild of five years death in convulsions took place after an illness\r\nof ten hours, the skin presenting purpurous spots, some of them very\r\nlarge and of a deep bluish livid hue. On post-mortem examination there\r\nwas not the slightest appearance of any meningeal lesion, except a few\r\ndark spots like sanguineous effusion under the arachnoid. The heart\r\nwas full of dark blood in a semi-coagulated state, and the white\r\ncorpuscles were three times as numerous as the red.[42] A case is\r\nreported by Gordon[43] in which the entire duration of the illness\r\nuntil death was five hours. This is probably the shortest case on\r\nrecord. A lady aged twenty-two years died in sixteen hours, the skin\r\ncovered with livid ecchymoses, some of them measuring an inch or an\r\ninch and a half in diameter.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, July, 1864, p. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, 1867, ii. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Med. Press and Circular_, May, 1866. For other cases\r\nsee _ibid._, pp. 296, 298-300.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the convalescence from epidemic meningitis must\r\nevidently be affected by the causes that determine its duration, the\r\ngrade of the disease, the development and extent of the lesions, etc.;\r\nbut it is certain that, except in those imperfect and, as it were,\r\nshadowy cases which denote a very slight action of the morbid cause,\r\nits subjects do not recover rapidly. The essential lesion of the\r\nfully-formed disease requires time for its removal, just as in typhoid\r\nfever the intestinal ulcers are often slow of healing, and hence\r\nbecome a cause of tardy recovery and even of unlooked-for death. The\r\nconvalescence, then, from the disease we are now studying is slow and\r\nirregular, is attended often with debility and emaciation, and\r\nsometimes with persistent headache, neuralgia, convulsions, stiffness\r\nof the neck and pain in moving it, hyperæsthesia of portions of the\r\nskin, palpitation of the heart, dyspepsia, etc. Relapses are very far\r\nfrom being uncommon.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of tardy convalescence in this disease are those\r\nlesions and disorders which may be embraced by the term sequelæ.\r\nImpaired vision, due to various affections of the eyes, has already\r\nbeen considered among the symptoms proper of the disease, but they are\r\nnot infrequently developed after the acute attack has subsided. Thus,\r\nin a case reported by Larrabie:[45] \"Just as convalescence seemed\r\nbeginning the left eye became affected in all its parts, with entire\r\nloss of vision and also complete deafness. After a short remission\r\nhydrencephaloid symptoms appeared, followed by the same changes in the\r\nhitherto sound eye, complete blindness and deafness, general cachexia\r\nand marasmus, rigid flexion of the right limbs, and death by\r\nexhaustion at the end of sixteen weeks.\" The impairment of hearing,\r\nwhich also was described as a symptom of the acute attack, is apt to\r\nbecome more marked after the acute stage has passed by, and, as before\r\nstated, is very often permanent. Occurring in young children, it then\r\ninvolves deaf-mutism. It is in many cases associated with defective\r\nvision, weakness or loss of memory, mania, impairment of intelligence,\r\npersistent pains in the head or chronic hydrocephalus. Sometimes to\r\none or more of these symptoms is added more or less general paresis or\r\ncomplete paralysis. Southhall[46] mentions the case of a child two\r\nyears old whose attack was followed by incomplete paralysis, and death\r\nat the end of eight months with softening {820} of the brain. Gordon\r\nthus describes the conclusion of a case: \"The man has gradually passed\r\ninto a state of almost organic life; he eats, drinks, and sleeps well;\r\nhe passes solid feces and urine without giving any notice, yet,\r\nevidently, not unconsciously; ... he seems to understand, but cannot\r\nanswer; ... he can draw up his legs and arms, but he cannot use his\r\nhands at all.\" Hirsch has remarked that disorders of speech are met\r\nwith, due apparently to an inability to articulate certain sounds. Von\r\nZiemssen regards chronic hydrocephalus as not a rare consequence of\r\nepidemic meningitis, and as one not absolutely or immediately fatal.\r\nIts symptoms include severe paroxysmal pain in the head or neck or\r\nextremities, with vomiting, loss of consciousness, convulsions, and\r\ninvoluntary evacuation of excrements. Between the paroxysms, which\r\nsometimes occur periodically, the patient generally suffers from\r\nneuralgic pains, hyperæsthesia, and various motor and even mental\r\ndisorders; but in other cases the intervals are free, or nearly so,\r\nfrom all morbid manifestations. Davis (1872) and many others speak of\r\nsevere neuralgic pains following this disease; according to Dr. D.,\r\nthey are most frequent at the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles, in\r\nthe abdomen, and the head; a very fretful disposition, variable\r\nappetite, and disturbed sleep are often observed. Relapses have been\r\nnoticed in almost all the epidemics, and it seems probable that they\r\nare often due to the influence of accidental exciting causes, mental\r\nor physical, in renewing the inflammation around the cerebro-spinal\r\nlesions. Miner (1825) remarked that they were most apt to occur within\r\nthe first week, but that when the disease had once run its course\r\nthere were very few relapses during convalescence. But, he adds, there\r\nwere several repeated attacks after the most perfect recovery, and\r\nseveral of the patients had had the disease the preceding year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Richmond Journal of Med._, Dec., 1872, p. 779.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Ibid._, Aug., 1872, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nLike other epidemic diseases, meningitis presents itself with every\r\npossible degree of gravity between that of a slight indisposition and\r\nthat of a malignant and deadly malady. The mortality in a number of\r\nepidemics compared by Hirsch varied between 20 per cent. and 75 per\r\ncent. It changes with the locality. Thus, nearly at the same time that\r\nthe death-rate from this disease in Massachusetts was 61 per cent., it\r\nwas but 33 per cent. in the Philadelphia Hospital. In 1872 the whole\r\nnumber of deaths caused by it in Philadelphia was 133, while at St.\r\nJohn's College, Little Rock, Ark., 21 cases out of 29 were fatal\r\n(Southhall). It differs, also, at different periods; for while ten\r\nepidemics in various places, occurring between 1838 and 1848,\r\npresented an average mortality of 70 per cent., a similar number,\r\noccurring between 1855 and 1865, gave an average mortality of only 30\r\nper cent. It must, however, be confessed that such statistics cannot\r\nbe relied upon as accurate, for in private practice many cases occur\r\nthat are never reported unless they end fatally.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions found after death from epidemic\r\nmeningitis consist essentially of congestion or inflammation of the\r\ncerebro-spinal meninges, but they also include in many cases\r\nhemorrhage, serous effusion, plastic exudation, and tissue-changes in\r\nthe brain and spinal marrow, and in many other cases an impaired\r\nconstitution of the blood. As the signs of the latter, and not the\r\nformer, alterations are met with in the more malignant cases, it is\r\nevident that, looking at the disease as a {821} whole, it must involve\r\na toxic element of whose operation the various post-mortem lesions are\r\nonly effects. These lesions, on the whole, vary with the type of the\r\ndisease, and also with its duration, but some are chiefly met with in\r\ncases of a malignant and others in cases of an inflammatory type.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the body after death in the early stages of this\r\ndisease almost always presents the marks of transudation of the\r\ncontents of the blood-vessels. The dependent parts of the body exhibit\r\nlarge livid patches or a uniform discoloration of the same hue. In\r\nacute cases the muscles are more deeply colored than natural, and when\r\nthe attack is prolonged they are said to have their cohesion impaired\r\nby fatty degeneration. Congestion of the brain is an unfailing\r\naccompaniment of the first stage of the disease; its blood-vessels are\r\nall distended with dark blood; the sinuses of the dura mater are\r\nusually filled with coagula of the same hue, though sometimes very\r\ndense. Serum abounds in the arachnoid cavity and in the ventricles of\r\nthe brain; it may be clear or milky, and sometimes it is quite\r\npurulent. It is alleged by one reporter that no less than three pints\r\nof turbid serum escaped in a case in which, however, death did not\r\noccur until the thirty-fifth day. Craig found eight and twelve ounces\r\nof a limpid fluid in two cases; and Tourdes found pus in more than\r\none-half of his cases, either unmixed or forming a milky liquid. J. L.\r\nSmith refers to the case of an infant who had the disease at the age\r\nof five months, and two months subsequently great prominence of the\r\nanterior fontanelle, and other symptoms which indicated the presence\r\nof a considerable amount of effusion within the cranium. In a case in\r\nDublin,[47] there was no meningeal lesion except in a \"few dark spots\r\nlike sanguineous effusion under the arachnoid.\" White[48] mentions the\r\ncase of an adult that terminated fatally in thirty-six hours, in which\r\nthe vessels of the pia mater were very much congested, and sanguineous\r\neffusions existed above and below the cerebellum, and a clot of blood\r\nthree inches long and external to the theca extended downward from the\r\nlowest portion of the medulla oblongata. In all of these instances,\r\nthen, congestion, the first stage of inflammation, existed. That such\r\nwas its real nature is proved by what follows.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Dublin Jour._, July, 1867, p. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Med. Record_, iii. 198.]\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic lesion is a fibrinous or purulent exudation in\r\nthe meshes of the pia mater. American physicians described it as early\r\nas 1806 in such terms as these: \"The dura mater and pia mater in\r\nseveral places adhered together and to the substance of the brain; ...\r\nbetween the dura mater and the pia mater was a fluid resembling pus\"\r\n(Danielson and Mann). In 1810, Bartlett and Wilson found \"an\r\nextravasation of lymph on the surface of the brain;\" and in the same\r\nyear Jackson and his colleagues, after describing the congestion and\r\nserous effusion found within the cranium \"in those who perished within\r\ntwelve hours of the first invasion,\" state that the arachnoid and pia\r\nmater present an effusion between them of \"coagulated lymph or\r\nsemi-purulent lymph\" both on the convexity and at the base of the\r\nbrain. These descriptions correspond in all respects with those of\r\nMathey relating to the epidemic at Geneva in 1805, for he says: \"The\r\nmeningeal blood-vessels were strongly injected. A jelly-like exudation\r\ntinged with blood covered the surface of the brain; ... on its lower\r\nsurface and in the ventricles a {822} yellowish puriform matter was\r\nfound.\" Such lesions have been described by a long line of\r\nobservers--by Wilson in 1813, Gamage in 1818, Ames and Sargent in\r\n1848; by Squire, Upham, and a host of others since 1860 in the United\r\nStates, and by Tourdes, Gilchrist, Ferrus, Wilks, Gordon, Banks,\r\nGaskoin, Niemeyer, Burdon-Sanderson, and many more in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that in a certain number of fatal cases only\r\nsanguineous congestion of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord\r\nare found, and in certain others--constituting, it may be added,\r\nnine-tenths of the whole number--evidences exist of cerebro-spinal\r\nmeningitis. Hence the natural conclusion is that the congestive\r\nlesions represent the first stage of a process which if prolonged and\r\nperfected occasions the lesions peculiar to inflammation. For the\r\ndevelopment of the latter two factors would seem to be essential--not\r\nonly a fibrinous condition of the blood, but also sufficient time for\r\nexudation to occur. But when we come to study the actual results of\r\nexaminations post-mortem, it is found that the duration of the attack\r\ndoes not determine absolutely the nature of the lesions. On the one\r\nhand, in a case which terminated fatally after a week's illness there\r\nwas found reddish serum between the arachnoid and the pia mater and in\r\nthe lateral ventricles, with intense injection of the pia mater of the\r\nbase, medulla oblongata, and upper part of the spinal cord, but no\r\nexudation of lymph.[49] And, on the other hand, numerous cases have\r\nbeen published in which, although death occurred within twenty-four\r\nhours from the onset of the attack, coagulated lymph and also pus were\r\nfound upon the brain and spinal marrow. For example, during the winter\r\nof 1861-62, in the army, that then lay near Washington, D.C., a\r\nsoldier was attacked with a chill, severe fever, and headache,\r\nfollowed by opisthotonos and repeated convulsions before his death,\r\nwhich occurred in about twenty-four hours. No eruption or\r\ndiscoloration of the skin is mentioned in the history. On examination\r\nthere was found beneath the arachnoid a thin layer of lymph and\r\nabundant exudation over the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, and also\r\nat the base of the brain and on the medulla oblongata.[50] In a case\r\nreported by Gordon[51] the entire duration of the illness was under\r\nfive hours, and after death the cerebral arachnoid was more or less\r\nopaque, and in some spots had a layer of very thin purulent matter\r\nbeneath it. And, again, not only may the symptoms belonging to\r\nblood-dissolution be consistent with a certain prolongation of life,\r\nbut also with decidedly inflammatory tissue-changes. Thus, in another\r\ncase of Gordon's the duration of the illness was at least six days,\r\nand the patient presented all the characteristic symptoms of the\r\ndisease, including \"a most wonderful and uniform curve of the spine\r\nand head backward,\" \"spots black as ink,\" \"bullæ which rapidly became\r\nopaque and dusky,\" \"herpetic eruption, etc.\" After death the body had\r\na very frightful appearance. It was still prominently arched forward.\r\nIt was of a dusky blue color, with a copious eruption of black spots\r\nof various sizes, and one or two of them were gangrenous.... When the\r\ntheca vertebralis was opened purulent matter flowed out, and a\r\npurulent effusion was found in patches on the brain. {823} The\r\ncerebral arachnoid was all opaque, the lateral ventricles were filled\r\nwith serum, and the blood in all the cavities was very fluid and dark\r\ncolored. From all that precedes, therefore, it must be inferred that\r\nthe nature of the lesions in this disease depends not on the type\r\nalone, nor on the duration merely, of the attack--that a very brief\r\ncourse is compatible with marked inflammatory lesions, and a prolonged\r\none with profound alterations in the condition of the blood. In other\r\nwords, it seems that there must be something besides the appreciable\r\nlesions that influences, if it does not determine, the issue of an\r\nattack of this affection. While bringing forward prominently this\r\nproposition, and the facts on which it rests, we have no intention of\r\nunder-estimating the relative significance of the two most conspicuous\r\ntypes of the disease, the purely inflammatory and the adynamic, or\r\ncalling in question the fact that the evolution of the former is most\r\nusually comparatively slow and regular, and of the latter rapid and\r\nirregular. In the one, when death takes place early, congestive\r\nchanges are found, and when later these have merged into exudative\r\nlesions; in the other or adynamic cases congestion and liquid\r\ntransudation prevail, and the results of complete inflammation are\r\nseldom seen. When the disease has been very much prolonged the\r\nexudation becomes tough, adherent, and shrivelled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Davis, _Richmond Med. Jour._, June, 1872, p. 709.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Frothingham, _Amer. Med. Times_, Apr., 1864, p. 207.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, May, 1867, p. 409.]\r\n\r\nThe brain-tissue has generally been found softer than natural, and,\r\nalthough in some cases this diminished consistence might be attributed\r\nto post-mortem changes, yet on the whole it must be associated with\r\nthe inflammatory lesions of the meninges. As a rule, it is greater the\r\nlonger the attack has lasted, and is by no means equally diffused, but\r\nis more marked where the meningeal alterations are greatest. Ames\r\nfound softening in nine out of eleven cases, and chiefly in the\r\ncortical substance, but also in the fornix and septum lucidum; and\r\nChauffard states that in protracted cases \"the interior surface of the\r\nventricles, the fornix, and septum lucidum, were reduced to a\r\npultaceous and creamy consistence.\" But it is by no means true that\r\nsoftening is met with in all cases of long duration.\r\n\r\nThe lesions of the spinal marrow and its membranes correspond with\r\nthose of the brain. The dura mater is often very dark, its\r\nblood-vessels engorged, its arachnoid cavity distended with serum more\r\nor less bloody, turbid, or purulent. Two ounces of pus have been\r\nremoved from it through a puncture. Fibrinous and purulent exudation\r\nfills the meshes of the pia mater, and is usually most abundant in the\r\ncervical and dorsal portions, and generally upon the posterior rather\r\nthan upon the anterior surface of the organ; but sometimes large\r\naccumulations of lymph and pus are found at the lower end of the cord.\r\nGordon[52] relates of a case that \"when an opening was made into the\r\nlower part of the theca vertebralis purulent matter flowed out, and\r\nthe entire surface of the pia mater was covered with a coating of thin\r\npurulent matter, which, like a thin layer of butter, remained adherent\r\nto it.\" Occasionally the cavity of the spinal arachnoid contains\r\nblood. Softening of the spinal cord has been often noticed. Chauffard\r\nstates that in some cases of particularly long duration it was reduced\r\nto a mere pulp, and he adds, \"in the place of portions of the spinal\r\nmarrow, completely destroyed, was found only a yellowish liquid, or\r\nthe empty membranes fell into contact where it was {824} wanting.\"\r\nSimilar disorganization has been described by Ames, Klebs, and others.\r\nFronmüller reports the case of a girl aged fourteen years in whom the\r\ncentral canal of the spinal cord was distended with pure pus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, xliii. 414.]\r\n\r\nThe lesions of the internal auditory apparatus consist of softening in\r\nthe fourth ventricle and of the root of the auditory nerve, yet such\r\nlesions are said to have been found even when no defect of hearing had\r\nexisted. In other cases in which deafness did occur the lesions\r\nconsisted of inflammatory changes in the cavity of the tympanum and\r\nsuppuration of the labyrinth. They probably arose from an extension of\r\ninflammation from the pia mater along the trunk of the auditory nerve\r\n(Von Ziemssen). In like manner, the inflammatory and destructive\r\nchanges in the eye which have been elsewhere described arise from an\r\nanalogous cause affecting the optic nerves.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell upon the condition in which other organs\r\nare found after death from epidemic meningitis. In cases that present\r\na typhoid type, and even in such as are rapidly fatal with ecchymotic\r\ndiscoloration of the skin, the various organs present no distinctive\r\ntissue-change, but only such engorgement as is common to all diseases\r\nof a similar type. It deserves to be particularly mentioned that in\r\nthis affection the spleen is not enlarged, as it always is in a\r\ngreater or less degree in diseases whose primary stage involves an\r\naltered condition of the blood. This fact becomes all the more\r\nimportant in view of the remarkable contrast which the constitution of\r\nthe blood presents in epidemic meningitis and in various typhous\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nThe state of the blood in this disease is one of peculiar interest,\r\ndominating as it does its whole pathology and determining its\r\nnosological position. It is the blood of a phlegmasia rather than of a\r\npyrexia. This fact was early established by American physicians who\r\nobserved the disease, and the opportunities for doing so were not\r\nwanting, since venesection was used by every one who treated it. In\r\n1807-09 a rapidly fatal case or two was found in which the \"blood was\r\ndarker and had a larger proportion of serum than usual,\" but in others\r\n\"it did not present any uncommon appearance, and no inflammatory buff,\r\nnor was it dissolved\" (Fish). In 1811, Arnell stated that \"the blood\r\ndrawn in the early stage appeared like that of a person in full\r\nhealth; there was no unusual buffy coat, neither was the crassamentum\r\nbroken down or destroyed.\" In the epidemic studied by Mannkopff (1866)\r\nhe found that blood obtained by venesection gave a clot with a thick\r\nbuffy coat. Andral, seeking to establish the law that in every acute\r\ninflammation there is an increase in the fibrin of the blood, remarks\r\nthat in a case of cerebro-spinal meningitis it was very marked.[53]\r\nAmes states that \"the blood taken from the arm and by cups from the\r\nback of the neck\" \"coagulated with great rapidity.\" \"Its color was\r\ngenerally bright--in a few cases nearly approaching to that of\r\narterial blood; it was seldom buffed; in thirty-seven cases in which\r\nits appearance was noted it was buffed in only four.\" Analyses were\r\nmade in four cases, \"the blood being taken early in the disease from\r\nthe arm, and was the first bleeding in each case. They furnished the\r\nfollowing results: {825}\r\n\r\n       Fibrin.

How different is this condition of the blood from that\r\nof typhus fever, in which there is a marked diminution of fibrin, and\r\na falling off in the red corpuscles as well, or from that of typhoid\r\nfever, in which neither element declines until the disease affects the\r\nbody by inanition!

It is true that even in this the agreement\r\nis neither general nor complete. Tourdes, for example, states that in\r\nan autopsy \"the blood was remarkable for the abundance and toughness\r\nof the fibrinous clots,\" but the greater number have reported it as\r\nbeing dark and liquid. Such was its condition in the epidemic which we\r\nstudied at the Philadelphia Hospital in 1866-67, and it has been\r\ncorrectly described by Dr. Githens as follows: \"The blood was fluid,\r\nof the color and appearance of port-wine lees; under the microscope\r\nthe corpuscles were shrivelled and crenated, and there was a space\r\napparent between them as they were arranged in rouleaux. There were in\r\ntwo cases white, firm, fibrinous heart-clots extending through both\r\nventricles and auricles and into the vessels leading to and from the\r\nheart.\"[56] It may be added that the red corpuscles are often crenated\r\nand shrivelled when the case has been protracted, and it has been\r\nstated--from limited observation, indeed--that \"the white corpuscles\r\nare three times more numerous than the red.\"[57] The blood has been\r\nscrutinized to discover, if possible, some of those bodies which are\r\njudged by Koch and his disciples to differentiate {826} general\r\ndiseases, but it is stated that the investigation has been without\r\ndefinite result.[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Amer. Jour. of Med. Sci._, July, 1867, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Dublin Quart. Jour._, May, 1867, p. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Jaffé, _Phila. Med. Times_, xii. 599.]\r\n\r\nIt does not seem difficult to reconcile the conflicting statements now\r\ngiven of the condition of the blood in epidemic meningitis. One of\r\nthem points to an excess and the other to a loss of the spontaneously\r\ncoagulable element of the blood. It is evident that venesection, which\r\nwas necessary for procuring the living blood for analysis, would only\r\nbe performed when the type of the disease authorized it--that is, when\r\nthe type was sthenic; whereas the blood examined after death had\r\nnecessarily undergone changes which tended to, if they did not\r\nactually, occasion death. Hence we find among the former cases, when\r\nfatal, the most extensive and massive exudation, and always among the\r\nlatter less evidence of inflammation, but, on the other hand, a\r\ngreater or less manifestation of those appearances which denote a loss\r\nof the vitality and organization of the blood. In the one case death\r\nmay fairly be attributed, above all other causes, to the pressure\r\nupon, and the disorganization of, the cerebro-spinal organs essential\r\nto life; in the other, primarily, to the death of the vital elements\r\nof the blood produced by the specific cause of the disease. It is\r\nprobable that the post-mortem fluidity of the blood exists under two\r\nconditions. In the one the morbid cause is powerful enough from the\r\nvery commencement rapidly to destroy the life of that fluid, and in\r\nthe other it acts less violently, but continuously, to exhaust the\r\npowers of life.\r\n\r\nOur conception of the pathology of epidemic meningitis is implicitly\r\ncontained in the foregoing discussion. Of its essential cause and of\r\nthe conditions that call it into existence nothing whatever is known.\r\nThe disease is most probably due to some atmospheric agency that is\r\ncapable of acting at the same time upon widely separated localities.\r\nIts specific cause appears to enter the blood first of all, and\r\ndoubtless through the lungs, and to be capable of destroying life by\r\nits action upon the blood alone. Failing this effect, its force is\r\nspent upon the cerebro-spinal pia mater, and it may become fatal by\r\nthe mechanical interference of the products of inflammation with the\r\nnutrition of those parts of the central nervous system which are\r\nessential to life. An inflammatory and a septic element together\r\nconstitute the fully-developed disease; either may be in excess and\r\novershadow the other. According to the relative predominance of one or\r\nthe other, the disease assumes more of a typhoid or more of an\r\ninflammatory type, and it is doubtless this diversity in its\r\nphysiognomy, as well as in the lesions that attend it, which has led\r\nto the most opposite doctrines respecting its nature and its\r\nnosological affinities.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The most distinctive phenomena of epidemic meningitis are\r\nsuddenness of attack and rapidity of development of the following\r\nsymptoms: acute pain in the head, neck, spine, and limbs; faintness,\r\nvomiting; stiffness or spasm of the cervical or spinal muscles;\r\nhyperæsthesia of the skin; delirium, alternating with intelligence and\r\nmerging afterward into dulness or coma; occasional convulsive spasms;\r\nparalysis of the face or of one side of the body. The evidences of\r\nassociated blood-poisoning are, the epidemic prevalence of the\r\ndisease, various eruptions upon the skin (herpes, roseola, petechiæ,\r\netc.), ecchymoses, debility out of proportion to the evidences of\r\nlocal disease, redness of the eyes, {827} foulness of the tongue and\r\nmouth, and more or less of the other conditions which characterize the\r\ntyphoid state. To these features must be added the rate of mortality,\r\nwhich is greater in most epidemics of meningitis than that of any\r\ndisease with which it is liable to be confounded.\r\n\r\nIt is distinguished from sporadic meningitis by the fact that the\r\nlatter disease is never primary, but is always either an epiphenomenon\r\nof some other and previous malady (various fevers and chronic blood\r\ndiseases) or is traumatic in its origin. The thermometer readily\r\ndistinguishes it from various functional nervous affections, chiefly\r\nhysterical, in which the temperature remains normal.\r\n\r\nFrom typhoid fever it differs as widely as possible by its rapid\r\nonset, the exquisite pain in the head, the neuralgic pains, the\r\nopisthotonos, and the convulsions. The alternate delirium or coma and\r\nclearness of mind in meningitis contrast with the persistent hebetude,\r\nstupor, or muttering delirium and the muscular relaxation in typhoid\r\nfever. The sordes on the tongue, the diarrhoea, the meteorism, the\r\nintestinal hemorrhage of the latter, instead of the moist or merely\r\ndry tongue and the transient vomiting and torpid bowels of the former;\r\nhigh or continuous fever on the one hand, slight or variable increase\r\nof temperature on the other; diffluence of blood in the one and an\r\nincrease in the proportion of its fibrin in the other; in the one\r\nsuppurative inflammation of the cerebro-spinal meninges, in the other\r\nspecific lesions of the intestinal and mesenteric glands,--these, as\r\nwell as the very different modes of origin of the two affections, draw\r\na broad and manifest line of distinction between them.\r\n\r\nIt would scarcely be necessary to point out the contrasts between\r\nepidemic meningitis and typhus fever were it not that, notwithstanding\r\nthe abundance of instruction on the subject in medical treatises and\r\nlectures, a large number of physicians confound typhus fever, typhoid\r\nfever, and the typhoid state of inflammatory diseases with one\r\nanother. The confusion was intensified at one time by designating the\r\ndisease we are studying as spotted fever--a term originally applied\r\nand properly belonging to typhus fever (typhus petechialis). It is\r\ntrue that New England physicians soon became aware of their error,\r\nwhich was distinctly pointed out and condemned by North, Strong,\r\nMiner, Foot, Fish, and others in the early part of this century. A\r\nsimilar error was at first committed both in Ireland and England, but\r\nwas corrected by maturer experience. In order to contrast the two\r\ndiseases as strongly as possible, we place their distinctive features\r\nside by side in the following table:\r\n\r\n       EPIDEMIC MENINGITIS.       |         TYPHUS FEVER.\r\n                                  |\r\n  A pandemic disease.

This fact must be\r\nborne in mind in estimating the influence of various circumstances in\r\ncontrolling the issue of the disease. The relative as well as the\r\naggregate mortality is far greater in childhood than in adult life.\r\nAfter the age of thirty or thirty-five it decreases rapidly until old\r\nage, when recovery from the disease is quite exceptional. A sudden or\r\nrapidly developed attack is generally unfavorable, especially when the\r\nsymptoms are adynamic and there is a purplish discoloration of the\r\nskin. Indeed, even apart from evidences {829} of blood-change,\r\ncerebral are, on the whole, of graver importance than spinal\r\nphenomena, and the more so the more typhoidal their type. Of still\r\nmore serious significance is a want of perception of the gravity of\r\nthe situation or unconcern about its issue. A preternaturally slow and\r\ncompressible pulse implies danger, and so does coolness of the skin,\r\nespecially if it grows purplish from a diffusion of blood beneath it\r\nor even from venous stasis. The various eruptions that have been\r\ndescribed including petechiæ, are not necessarily dangerous signs.\r\nProfuse sweats during a soporose state, bullæ and gangrenous spots,\r\nobstruction of the bronchia with mucus or serum, pneumonia or\r\npericarditis,--these are all grave indications. So, too, are a dry,\r\nfissured, shrivelled, and pale tongue or a fuliginous state of the\r\nmouth, swelling of the parotids, obstinate vomiting, and profuse\r\ndiarrhoea at an advanced stage of the disease. Among the most\r\nunfavorable nervous symptoms are great restlessness, rigid retraction\r\nof the head, spasms of other than the spinal muscles, general\r\nconvulsions, extensive hyperæsthesia, deep coma, dilatation and\r\ninsensibility of the pupils or their rapid change from a dilated to a\r\ncontracted state, retention or incontinence of urine, and all cerebral\r\nparalyses, including that of the muscles of deglutition. The favorable\r\nindications comprise a general mildness of the symptoms, a moderate\r\nloss of strength, a slight degree of pain and muscular stiffness, the\r\nabsence of petechiæ or vibices (although in many grave epidemics they\r\nare of rare occurrence), a desire for food and the ability to digest\r\nit. Yet it is imprudent to make an absolute prognosis in any grave\r\ncase of this disease. Recovery has sometimes occurred when it appeared\r\nimpossible, and some have died when the period of danger seemed to\r\nhave passed on the sudden accession of cerebral or spinal nervous\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--The difficulties that attend the solution of therapeutical\r\nquestions regarding diseases which are comparatively regular in their\r\nevolution, and are produced by definite causes acting in an\r\nintelligible manner, are very numerous and often insuperable. They\r\nbecome multiplied in relation to a disease which, like this one,\r\nstands alone in many respects; whose causes, phenomena, and\r\nlesions--in a word, whose laws--are specific; and whose varieties of\r\ntype are as numerous as can be formed by the combination, in a\r\nconstantly varying proportion, of a special (hypothetical) alteration\r\nof the blood, deranging the molecular actions of the economy, and at\r\nthe same time of an inflammation of the cerebro-spinal meninges, and\r\neven of the substance of the great nervous centres. These reasons are\r\nsufficient to account for the diverse and often opposite methods of\r\ntreatment that have been applied to the disease. As in almost all\r\nother cases, the methods have consisted in using remedies to\r\ncounteract certain symptoms--now a stimulant or tonic regimen to\r\ncombat the debility which conferred the name of \"sinking typhus\" on\r\nthe disease; now an antiphlogistic course to allay the inflammation of\r\nthe brain and spinal marrow denoted by the neuralgic pain and the\r\ntetanoid phenomena; and, again, large doses of narcotics to blunt the\r\npain and subdue the spasm. Still other medications have been used with\r\na similar purpose, and some, as we shall see, with more or less\r\ntheoretical views. It may be said, with Von Ziemssen, \"that we are far\r\nfrom having it in our power to decide whether a rational treatment of\r\nthe symptoms has cured the disease or lessened its mortality;\" but a\r\nreview of the methods {830} that have been employed and their results\r\nleads to no doubtful conclusion that some are mischievous and others\r\nmore or less salutary.\r\n\r\nEmetics were among the first medicines used in the treatment of this\r\naffection, and were probably suggested by the vomiting which is one of\r\nits most constant initial symptoms. But we can readily understand why\r\nthey failed to afford relief. The vomiting and retching are not\r\ngastric symptoms at all, but, as already stated, are due to the\r\nirritation of the congestive or inflammatory process at the base of\r\nthe brain. These medicines may therefore be omitted. The employment of\r\npurgatives is even less rational; they debilitate without affording\r\nany relief.\r\n\r\nVenesection was probably employed as a part of a routine treatment\r\nwhich neither sound reason nor clinical experience justified. It was\r\ngenerally found to fail of its curative purpose, and often induced,\r\nespecially in young persons, dangerous exhaustion. No better\r\nillustration is needed to show that the disease we have been studying\r\nis far more than a local inflammation of the cerebro-spinal meninges.\r\nOn the other hand, local depletion is often of marked utility. Our own\r\nexperience would lead us to conclude that in the more sthenic cases\r\nscarified cups, applied to the nape of the neck and along the cervical\r\nvertebræ, are of essential service in mitigating--and generally,\r\nindeed, in wholly removing--the neuralgic pains which form so\r\nprominent and severe a symptom in many cases of this disease. When any\r\nabstraction of blood appears to be contraindicated by the patient's\r\ndebility, even dry cups will afford him signal relief. Leeches have\r\nbeen applied to the parts mentioned, and over the mastoid processes\r\nhave sometimes been used with advantage, but their depletory surpasses\r\ntheir revulsive action, and is, so far, injurious. Cold to the head\r\nand spine is among the most efficient means of relieving certain\r\nsymptoms. In the Massachusetts Medical Society's Report of 1810 we\r\nread: \"Cold water, snow, and ice have been applied to the head when\r\nthere was violent pain in that part with heat and flushed face, and\r\nwhen there was violent delirium. They afforded great comfort to the\r\npatient, and mitigated or removed those important symptoms.\" It is\r\nprobable, however, that the value of the remedy is almost entirely\r\nrestricted to the forming--or at least the early--stage of the attack,\r\nwhen the pain in the head is most intense. Its soothing influence is\r\nthen very marked, as well as its indirect action in promoting sleep.\r\nHeat of head is not an essential condition for its use, for even in\r\nthe most violent cases it is rarely extreme, and is often entirely\r\nwanting. Pain calls more distinctly for the application, and when that\r\nsymptom has subsided cold is apt to be more annoying than grateful to\r\nthe patient. Cold is best applied to the head in the form of pounded\r\nice enclosed in a bladder or rubber bag; but cold affusions are also\r\nvery valuable, especially for children. For the application of cold to\r\nthe spine the most efficient apparatus is the long, flat rubber bag,\r\neither single or double.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest history of epidemic meningitis in this country\r\nblisters formed a conspicuous element in the treatment. They were\r\nused, as they had been in other forms of meningitis, to relieve the\r\npain and diminish the congestion in the cerebro-spinal centres. The\r\nresults of their use were by no means uniform, for not only were they\r\nemployed in many of the cases which must almost necessarily have been\r\nfatal before inflammation could be established, but even in the\r\ninflammatory cases {831} they were often applied when time enough had\r\nelapsed to allow the exudation to be fully formed, and when,\r\ntherefore, they were too late to be useful. Again, they were sometimes\r\nused so as to vesicate too deeply, and thus by the pain they caused at\r\nfirst, and by the exhaustion that resulted from the excessive\r\ndischarges they maintained, the patient was more injured than\r\nbenefited. Our own experience proves that in the early stage of the\r\ninflammatory form of the disease blisters applied below the occipital\r\nridge and upon the back of the neck, and only allowed to vesicate\r\nsuperficially, not only remove the pain in the head, but diminish the\r\ndelirium, spasms, and coma, and therefore contribute as directly as\r\nother remedies, if not more so, to the favorable issue of the attack.\r\nBut such salutary effects are not to be looked for when the disease\r\nassumes a malignant type nor after its constitution has become\r\ndefinitely fixed. The application of stimulant and even vesicating\r\nagents to the spine below the neck has not been generally practised\r\nbecause, probably, the seat of the spinal lesions was known to be\r\nchiefly at the upper part of the organ. Still, the neuralgic pains\r\nfelt in the spinal nerves may be mitigated by stimulant and anodyne\r\nliniments applied with friction to the spinal column.\r\n\r\nAmerican physicians early recognized coolness of the skin among the\r\nmost striking phenomena of the disease; and this probably suggested\r\ntheir use of diaphoretic remedies, among which were the external\r\napplication of moist heat in baths and warm wrappings, as well as\r\n\"bottles of hot water or billets of wood heated in boiling water and\r\nwrapped in flannel,\" or the patient \"was wrapped in flannel wrung out\r\nof boiling water, sinapisms were applied to the feet, while hot\r\ninfusions were administered, made from the leaves of mint, pennyroyal,\r\nand other similar plants, and also wine-whey, wine and water, wine,\r\nbrandy, and other ardent spirits more or less diluted, camphor,\r\nsulphuric ether, and opium. It was not generally thought useful to\r\nexcite profuse sweating, but important to maintain the activity of the\r\nskin from twenty to forty hours, and even longer in some instances.\r\nSoup and cordials were at the same time administered. Under this\r\ntreatment most commonly the violent symptoms, and not very rarely all\r\nthe appearances of disease, have subsided\" (Jackson). Beyond all\r\ndoubt, this method was a rational one, for it tended to promote an\r\nelimination of the morbid poison, while it depleted the blood-vessels\r\nand acted revulsively upon the local inflammation of the\r\ncerebro-spinal meninges. Yet it seems not to have been revived during\r\nthe more recent epidemics of the disease, unless, partially, by Gordon\r\n(1867), who says: \"What I have seen most useful in the stage of\r\ncollapse is external warmth applied to the entire surface by means of\r\nflannel bags containing roasted salt, applied along the spine, along\r\nthe chest, inside the arms, and to the feet and legs and between\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nExcept typhus fever, there is no disease in which a due administration\r\nof alcoholic stimulants may become more important. In cases of the\r\ninflammatory type they are rarely needful, and are frequently hurtful,\r\nbut in those which exhibit signs of blood disorder with nervous\r\nexhaustion they are often indispensable. Nothing demonstrates their\r\nnecessity more clearly than the extraordinary tolerance of alcohol\r\nexhibited in some cases of the disease. Among the earlier American\r\nauthorities may be found many illustrations of this statement.\r\nWoodward (1808) {832} observed that very large quantities of wine or\r\nardent spirits may be given without injury. Arnell said: \"In some\r\ncases I have given a quart of brandy in six or eight hours with the\r\nhappiest effect.\" Haskell maintained that \"the bold and liberal use of\r\ndiffusible stimuli is the only safe and efficacious mode of\r\ntreatment.\" In Ireland the habitual use of alcohol in the treatment of\r\ntyphus fever no doubt suggested its liberal employment in this\r\ndisease, but such stimulants have never been in vogue among the\r\nphysicians of France or Germany. This difference may in part be\r\naccounted for by the generally asthenic type of the disease in the\r\nfirst-named country and its more inflammatory character in the others.\r\nSimilar contrasts of type mark different epidemics, and individual\r\ncases during the same epidemic. We have no doubt that while these\r\nagents are indispensable in the treatment of cases of the former type,\r\nthey must even then be exhibited discreetly, for their too lavish\r\nexhibition entails the gravest peril by intoxicating the patients and\r\noppressing instead of arousing their vital energies. In 1866, on\r\ntaking charge of the medical wards in the Philadelphia Hospital, we\r\nfound that the patients were using as large quantities of alcohol as\r\nare given in typhus fever, but a very short period of observation\r\nshowed that this use of the stimulant was excessive; consequently the\r\ndose of it was first reduced, and finally it was omitted altogether\r\nunless special indications for it arose. This change was followed by a\r\nmanifest improvement in the general aspect of the sick and the\r\nsubsidence of symptoms which, it then became evident, were due to a\r\nlavish use of stimulants rather than to the gravity of the disease.\r\nAlcohol is no more essential to the treatment of epidemic meningitis\r\nthan of any other acute affection; it is a cordial to be held in\r\nreserve to meet those signs of failure of the heart and nervous system\r\nwhich may arise in all acute diseases attended with changes in the\r\ncondition of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe use of opium in the treatment of this disease was strongly\r\nadvocated by nearly all of the early American writers upon the\r\nsubject, and by many of them enormous doses were given. It was\r\nobserved not to produce narcotic effects in ordinary doses. In one\r\ncase, marked by excruciating pain in the head and maniacal delirium,\r\nsixty drops of laudanum were given every hour until nearly half an\r\nounce had been taken within eight hours (Strong). Haskell states: \"We\r\nhave been obliged frequently to exhibit ten grains of opium for a dose\r\nin some of the violent cases attended with strong spasms, and have\r\nnever known it to produce stupor in a single instance.\" Miner relates\r\nthat \"a few cases imperiously required half an ounce of the tincture\r\nof opium in an hour, or half a drachm [of opium] in substance in the\r\ncourse of twelve hours, before the urgent symptoms could be\r\ncontrolled, and even some cases required a drachm in the same time.\r\nAll these patients recovered.\" In Europe, Chauffard administered opium\r\nin doses of from three to fifteen grains, and Boudin frequently\r\nprescribed from seven to fifteen grains at a single dose at the\r\ncommencement of the attack, and subsequently one or two grains every\r\nhalf hour, until the patient grew sleepy or his symptoms subsided.\r\nThis tolerance of the drug is remarkable, and so is the fact that it\r\ndoes not cause constipation. These and many similar statements agree\r\nentirely with our personal experience. We were in the habit, during\r\nthe epidemic above referred to, of prescribing one grain {833} of\r\nopium every hour in very severe and every two hours in moderately\r\nsevere cases, and in no instance was narcotism induced, or even an\r\napproach to that condition. Under the influence of the medicine the\r\npain and spasm subsided, the skin grew warmer and the pulse fuller,\r\nand the entire condition of the patient more hopeful. It seemed\r\nprobable, however, that the benefit of the opium treatment was most\r\ndecided in the early stages of the attack, and hence in those in which\r\nthe inflammatory and spasmodic elements predominated. The hypodermic\r\ninjection of morphia is to be preferred before the internal\r\nadministration of other preparations of opium, not only on account of\r\nits prompter action, but because it avoids the rejection of the\r\nmedicine by vomiting. On the whole, Von Ziemssen is within the bounds\r\nof truth when he says, \"Beyond all doubt morphia may be considered the\r\nmost indispensable medicine in the treatment of epidemic meningitis.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence sufficient to show that epidemic meningitis has\r\never been cured by quinia alone. In the early prevalence of the\r\ndisease it was treated by large doses of cinchona, but unavailingly,\r\nand subsequently smaller doses were given during the convalescence, as\r\nit was in that of other acute diseases. In some parts of this country\r\nwhere miasmatic diseases prevail, and epidemic meningitis, like all\r\nother acute, and especially febrile, disorders, displayed more or less\r\nof a periodical or paroxysmal type, quinia was used in large doses,\r\nbut the expected result was not realized. Upham states that in some\r\ninstances it was given to the extent of sixty, or even eighty, grains\r\nwithin twelve hours from the beginning of the attack, but without\r\neffect. In Europe it was extensively tried and unanimously condemned.\r\nIt may very properly be left out of the list of medicines suitable for\r\nthis disease, particularly since it is no longer probable that any\r\nphysician would be rash enough to employ it in the so-called\r\nantipyretic doses with or without their usual associates, cold baths.\r\nAccording to Karl Jaffé, the medicinal antipyretics (quinia, salicylic\r\nacid, and also sodium benzoate) may be entirely discarded, because\r\nthey ruin the already weakened digestion.[59]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Phila. Med. Times_, xii. 600.]\r\n\r\nCommon sense has also proved stronger than theory in excluding\r\nmercurials from the treatment of epidemic meningitis. At one time they\r\nwere extensively used, especially when it was learned that the disease\r\nin its full development included a paramount inflammatory element. But\r\nit was soon found that the results of their use were far from uniform,\r\nand farther still from being demonstrably beneficial. In this, as in\r\nmany other similar cases, it is quite impossible to reach a definite\r\njudgment unless it were known what was the type of the cases in which\r\nthe medicine was given, whether they were asthenic or inflammatory,\r\nand again whether it was used during the active or during the\r\ndeclining stage and toward convalescence. In the absence of any\r\ntrustworthy testimony upon the subject it is only possible at present\r\nto state that in the treatment of this disease mercurials should not\r\nbe used. This conclusion is all the more imperative because the\r\nmedicine is not an indifferent one. If it is not necessary--and it\r\ncertainly is not--it is too dangerous in its immediate and ultimate\r\neffects for its employment to be warranted.\r\n\r\nSince belladonna and ergot were shown to diminish vascular action in\r\nthe cerebro-spinal axis by contracting its capillary blood-vessels,\r\nthey have {834} been put forward as having a specific virtue in this\r\ndisease. If the fact be so, how is that other fact--a clinical one,\r\nmoreover--to be disposed of, which is that opium, the physiological\r\nantagonist of belladonna and ergot, is more efficient than they are in\r\ncuring the disease? It is possible, indeed, that they may have that\r\ncurative power, and that opium possesses it also, and that the\r\nexplanation given of the action of all of these agents is erroneous.\r\nUpham states that, in 1863, Haddock recommended ergot upon theoretical\r\ngrounds, and that during an epidemic at Newbern, N.C., several cases\r\ntreated by it recovered. Three cases recovered in which it was\r\nprescribed by Borland. Read used it in 1873-74 at Boston, Mass., and\r\nout of 19 cases 16 recovered and 3 died.[60] This mortality of about\r\n15 per cent. is not more than half of that which has generally been\r\nmet with, and if it can be attributed to the treatment would go far to\r\nprove the efficacy of the latter. One grain of ergotine, with\r\none-tenth of a grain of extract of belladonna, was administered every\r\nthree hours. Considering the exiguity of the dose of belladonna, it is\r\nnot surprising that, except in one case, it did not dilate the pupil;\r\nand the dose of ergotine is likewise far smaller than the average\r\nmedicinal dose of that preparation. Moreover, all of the cases except\r\nthe fatal ones appear to have presented the disease in a subacute, and\r\ncertainly not in an aggravated, form.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Philadelphia Med. and Surg. Reporter_, Jan., 1875, p.\r\n68.]\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Dr. S. N. Davis,[61] moved by the success of Calabar bean in\r\ntetanus, employed it in this disease. A mixture of one ounce of\r\ntincture of Calabar bean with one and a half ounces of fluid extract\r\nof ergot was administered in doses of half a teaspoonful every two\r\nhours, and with better results than had followed other remedies. Here,\r\nagain, it is to be noticed that the analogy suggesting the use of\r\nphysostigma is not a logical one. That drug indeed relieves the spinal\r\nspasms of tetanus--a disease in which there is an irritation of the\r\nspinal axis, but no exudation from its meningeal vessels, as in the\r\naffection we are studying. Moreover, it is a disease of extraordinary\r\npower, as shown not only by the spasms, but by the exceptionally high\r\ntemperature, and thus again is in direct contrast to epidemic\r\nmeningitis. If, therefore, Calabar bean benefits that disease, it\r\ncannot do so in the manner suggested by the author.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Richmond and Louisville Med. Jour._, xiii. 711.]\r\n\r\nBromide of potassium and hydrate of chloral have also been employed to\r\nallay the spasmodic symptoms; but the former is too feeble for the\r\npurpose, and the depressing action of the latter upon the heart\r\nrenders it dangerous. Bromide of potassium has been given to children\r\nof two and five years in doses of four and six grains every two hours;\r\nbut these doses appear to be quite too small even for the purpose in\r\nview--viz. to prevent convulsive attacks. Whatever remedies may be\r\nsuggested hereafter, none should be employed that tend to reduce the\r\npower of the heart, which, as we have seen, is dangerously depressed\r\nby the disease.\r\n\r\nDuring the decline and convalescence of the affection it is probable\r\nthat iodide of potassium may be advantageously used to promote the\r\nremoval of the exudation-matter on the brain and spinal marrow, and\r\nprobably to prevent the hydrocephalus which sometimes follows the\r\nattack, and is attributable to the pressure of effused lymph upon the\r\ncerebral veins.\r\n\r\nDIET.--The mildly febrile character of epidemic meningitis, and the\r\n{835} remarkable debility which characterizes so many cases of the\r\ndisease, and which, as was before pointed out, conferred upon it the\r\nname typhus syncopalis, plainly justify what experience has taught,\r\nthat appropriate food for the subjects of this affection is at once\r\nthe most digestible and nutritious that can be taken. It is true that\r\nthis regimen is interfered with by the vomiting, but, as that symptom\r\nis of cerebral and not of gastric origin, it is more apt to be allayed\r\nby suitable food than by abstinence. It has been our custom to observe\r\nin this disease the same rules respecting diet that are recognized as\r\nthe most suitable in typhus fever. In doing so, indeed, we did,\r\nwithout at the time knowing it, follow the example of the early\r\nAmerican physicians. Strong, who wrote in 1811, advised \"soup made\r\nfrom chicken, veal, mutton, and beef, richly seasoned with pepper and\r\nsavory herbs.\" These articles were prescribed by him during the height\r\nof the disease. Later on he says: \"The stomach soon begins to crave\r\nsomething more solid than soup; oysters, beefsteak, cold ham, or\r\nneat's tongue are received with peculiar relish. Often I have seen\r\nconvalescents, when they had hardly strength enough to raise\r\nthemselves in bed, make a hearty meal of the above-mentioned articles,\r\nwhich were received with great satisfaction, sat well upon the\r\nstomach, and were well digested and assimilated.\" This method is\r\nsubstantially the same that was found successful in the earlier, as it\r\nhas been in the later, epidemics in this country, and we have no\r\nhesitation in attributing to it and the appropriate use of opium and\r\nblisters the degree of success we enjoyed in the treatment of the\r\ndisease in the Philadelphia Hospital and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence from epidemic meningitis the patient should\r\ncarefully abstain from physical exertion and mental excitement, and\r\nbefore this state is fully established he should even very cautiously\r\nchange his position from a recumbent to an erect posture. And,\r\nfinally, he should return to his ordinary occupations, mental or\r\nphysical, as late as possible, on account of the danger of a relapse,\r\nwhich has already been described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{836}\r\n\r\nPERTUSSIS.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN M. KEATING, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--A careful study of this disease from the various writings\r\nsince the time of Hippocrates leaves little doubt in the mind of the\r\nreader as to its antiquity, so little indeed has it changed in its\r\nvarious characteristics. Whether the affection passed to continental\r\nEurope from Africa, or whether its starting-point was India, are\r\nquestions difficult to solve, and, except for the medical historian,\r\nof little import. Desruelles probably truthfully asserts that the many\r\ndifferences which mark the descriptions of the disease, especially by\r\nthe early Grecian writers, may be due, not to the non-existence of the\r\ndisease as we know it, but to the influence which climate exerted then\r\nas now, and to the unrecognized fact that it is only fatal in its\r\ncomplications. The writings of Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna,\r\nthough undoubtedly referring to the many affections in which\r\nparoxysmal cough is a prominent symptom, contain many expressions that\r\nwould point clearly to the existence of a specific disease. Dr. Watt\r\nbelieved that the disease was not known to the Greeks, and other\r\nwriters claim that it came from the north and spread southward over\r\nEurope about the sixth century; nevertheless, it first appears on\r\nrecord as a distinct affection, disentangled from the confused mass\r\nwith which it was involved for centuries, about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. Steffen mentions the first well-established\r\naccounts as coming from Baillou in the year 1600, and Schenck in 1650,\r\nand Ettmüller in 1685. Sydenham casually mentions it in 1670. Since\r\nthe time of Willis the definition of the disease has remained\r\nunaltered, and so accurate was the description then given of it that\r\nwe can but naturally conclude that for many centuries at least it has\r\nvaried but little.\r\n\r\nIn studying affections of this kind, occurring in epidemic form\r\nespecially, and which are increased in intensity by whatever means the\r\ncontagious element, whether gaseous or parasitic, is made more\r\nvirulent, much allowance is to be made for the climate, customs, and\r\nhabits of the people whence our data are derived. Thus, most of the\r\ndiseases of antiquity, the descriptions of which have reached us, have\r\nbeen drawn from types modified by mild climates where the people have\r\nled an out-door life, and though the disease we see at the present day\r\nis one and the same so far as its causation is concerned, the indoor\r\nlife and close confinement, the bad ventilation, and the artificial\r\nexistence in our large cities must weaken the individual, intensify\r\nthe poison, and exert an influence on the disease.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION.--Whooping cough has been {837}\r\ncharacterized as an acute contagious affection, occurring usually in\r\nchildhood, though it may occur at any age, and lasting several weeks.\r\nIt is manifested usually by malaise, catarrh of the respiratory tract,\r\nand subsequently by a convulsive cough occurring in paroxysms, the\r\npeculiarity of which consists of a series of forcible expirations,\r\nfollowed by a sonorous inspiration or whoop, which may be repeated\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of these paroxysms of coughing, there are evidences\r\nof slight laryngeal irritation, attended by an effort at suppressing\r\nthe cough; then follow gradually increasing and more audible\r\ninspirations, which become more and more difficult. The child is\r\nagitated, the face becomes pale, and the countenance has a mingled\r\nexpression of supplication and fear. If it is old enough it will seize\r\nthe nearest object for support. As the spell advances, the eyes become\r\nsuffused and prominent and the loose tissue surrounding the orbits\r\nappears puffy and congested. Finally, the paroxysm reaches its height;\r\nthe child, with a livid countenance, with veins standing out like\r\ncords, gives a succession of violent expiratory efforts, followed by a\r\nlong inspiratory whoop. The same is repeated several times, until\r\nfinally almost complete cyanosis takes place; the spasm relaxes, a\r\nglairy, tenacious mucus runs from the mouth, the contents of the\r\nstomach are vomited, and the child falls back exhausted. The lividity\r\nof the countenance is succeeded by a deathly pallor; the face still\r\nappears swollen and puffy beneath the eyes; the tears course down the\r\ncheeks, and frequently hemorrhage occurs from the eyes, nose, ears, or\r\nthroat, owing to the terrific strain upon the circulation. As soon as\r\nthe child has recovered from the fatigue of the paroxysm all is\r\napparently over, and were it not for the characteristic expression of\r\nthe eye, which is pathognomonic in a well-advanced case, nothing would\r\nbe noticed to even suggest the disease when uncomplicated. The voice\r\nis clear; there is little or no elevation of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe paroxysms which have given the name to this disease can only be\r\nlikened to an epileptic convulsion, which by gradually increasing\r\ncyanosis is self-curable, the carbonized blood finally bringing about\r\nan anæsthetic effect. The severity of the paroxysms is by no means in\r\nproportion to the local catarrh, which latter may be superficial and\r\nslight, not to be detected during life by the most careful laryngeal\r\nexaminations, and only after death by the aid of the microscope. The\r\nfrequency and intensity of the paroxysms are dependent in a measure\r\nupon the degree of excitability of the nervous system, which of course\r\ndiffers in individuals. It is evident that the success of treatment\r\nmust be powerfully influenced by this circumstance, and it is partly\r\nowing to it that there are so many opinions as to the value of\r\nremedies in this disease.\r\n\r\nThe complications are usually dependent upon outside causes, and have\r\nnothing to do with the poison proper of whooping cough, as far as we\r\ncan tell. There are some which depend on an inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane, which may be limited to any portion of the respiratory tract\r\nor may extend throughout it. Complications may arise from mechanical\r\nobstruction to inspiration by the swollen mucous membrane or from\r\nplugs of tenacious mucus, which may cause pulmonary collapse and favor\r\nthe development of catarrhal pneumonia, and later even of phthisis; or\r\nfrom impediments to free and easy expiration, whether from spasm of\r\nthe bronchioles, from forcible compression of the thorax through\r\nreflex {838} nervous irritation, or from other obstructions, all of\r\nwhich tend to produce emphysema. Disturbances of the circulation, in\r\nthe brain or elsewhere, may proceed from thrombi or emboli and give\r\nrise to complications which will render fatal an otherwise mild form\r\nof the disease. The invariable disturbance of nutrition which\r\naccompanies every disease affecting the nervous system is apt to show\r\nitself in the breaking down of products which are simply inflammatory.\r\nVomiting may be a most serious complication, both from its immediate\r\nand remote effects. It may be due to gastric catarrh, or more\r\nfrequently to irritation of the pneumogastric nerve.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Very numerous theories have been advanced as to the nature\r\nof this interesting disease. Hufeland, Lebenstein, Pinel, Jahn, Todd,\r\nCullen and a host of others have regarded it as essentially a\r\nneurosis. By many others it has been supposed to be due to a lesion of\r\nthe brain or of its membranes, but careful investigation has\r\nestablished the fact that there is no lesion in whooping cough at all\r\nconstant or characteristic. By still others, and especially by Gueneau\r\nde Mussy, it has been regarded as essentially an affection of the\r\ntracheo-bronchial glands, a bronchial adenopathy, causing irritation\r\nof the pneumogastrics and of their bronchial branches by pressure of\r\nthe enlarged glands. We have, however, seen many post-mortem\r\nexaminations of the bodies of children who have died of measles, where\r\nmarked enlargement of these glands was constantly found, but where no\r\nsymptoms of whooping cough had been present. There are indeed many\r\nfeatures of the disease which seem inexplicable on any other theory\r\nthan that the essential cause of whooping cough is a specific poison,\r\nand such is the view now generally adopted. This poison is capable of\r\nbeing carried by fomites, though as it is highly infectious it is\r\noften communicated through the atmosphere, and is most frequently\r\nconveyed from individual to individual. Dolan,[1] who has recently\r\npublished a very interesting and valuable monograph on this affection,\r\nquotes Linnæus, who ascribed it to the irritation of insects, as the\r\nauthor of the modern view that whooping cough is due to the presence\r\nof a peculiar microbe, though it must be conceded that as yet it has\r\nnot been discovered. Most observers hold that the contagium is not in\r\nthe blood, but that it resides in the secretions of the respiratory\r\npassages, and is most virulent during that stage of the disease when\r\nthe secretion is abundant. Letzerich states that he has {839}\r\nsucceeded in producing whooping cough in rabbits by inoculating the\r\ntrachea with the sputa of the human subject. Dolan obtained similar\r\nresults by injecting the nasal secretions, and also by compelling\r\nrabbits to inhale air impregnated with decomposing sputa and vomit of\r\npatients suffering with the disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dolan, Thos. M., _Whooping Cough_, London, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe following brief statement of his conclusions may be quoted as\r\npresenting the most important facts concerning the pathology of the\r\ndisease:\r\n\r\n1st. Pertussis depends on a specific poison or contagion; this is\r\nuniversally admitted.\r\n\r\n2d. This contagion is active and highly infectious; this is also\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n3d. The contagion is analogous to the contagia which produce splenic\r\nfever, measles, scarlatina, variola, etc.\r\n\r\n4th. It has a peculiar determination to the lungs.\r\n\r\n5th. Like all other contagia, it has its period of activity and\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\n6th. The period of greatest activity is in the first and second\r\nstages.\r\n\r\n7th. Pertussis runs a regular course like measles, scarlatina,\r\nvariola, etc., and rarely attacks a person but once.\r\n\r\n8th. It may thus be classed among zymotic diseases.\r\n\r\n9th. The fact that there is no primary pathognomonic morbid change\r\nsupports this view.\r\n\r\n10th. There are various secondary lesions which are characteristic, as\r\nulcerations of the frænum linguæ.\r\n\r\n11th. The mode of death harmonizes with this view.]\r\n\r\nI do not, however, feel entirely satisfied in adopting the view that\r\nthe contagium of whooping cough resides alone in the mucous membranes\r\nof the air-passages.[2] Children have been known to be born with the\r\ndisease, the mother having suffered from it some time previous to\r\nconfinement. The following case occurred under my own observation:\r\nMrs. F----, the mother of two children, was in her eighth month of\r\npregnancy; the two children had at the time a very severe attack of\r\nwhooping cough, which required the constant attendance of the mother.\r\nShe, though an extremely intelligent woman, belonged to the poorer\r\nclasses, and had no one to assist her at this trying time. One day she\r\ncomplained that the movements of her child in utero had entirely\r\nchanged. Suddenly, without any previous motion, the child would become\r\nvery active; the force of its movements was such as to make hazardous\r\nany attempt on her part to walk in the street. The suddenness with\r\nwhich the movement would come on would oblige her to seize the nearest\r\nobject for support. This continued until the child was born. Shortly\r\nafter labor my attention was called to the infant, which had a curious\r\nattack, it became deeply cyanosed, seemed asphyxiated, as it were, for\r\na moment, had no convulsions, and within a few seconds resumed its\r\nnormal breathing and the circulation seemed once more established. I\r\nsaw the child in several of these attacks; its health did not seem to\r\nbe impaired, and without treatment, within a few weeks they\r\ndisappeared altogether. The mother insisted upon the fact that the\r\nchild had whooping cough, and the absence of the characteristic whoop\r\nwas the only thing that prevented the diagnosis from being positive.\r\nThis would show--and there are enough cases on record to warrant our\r\nbasing an opinion upon them--that the contagium of whooping cough is\r\nfound not alone in the matters expectorated, notwithstanding the\r\nstatement of Dolan and others that their experiments failed to show\r\nits existence in the blood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Colson, _Lancet_, July 2d.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, in reference to cases which seem to have\r\narisen without any exposure to the specific poison, that the\r\ncharacteristic whoop is not always present, and that consequently the\r\ntrue nature of mild cases of the disease which may infect other\r\nindividuals may have been overlooked. Childhood probably acts as a\r\npredisposing cause, though the disease occurs at all periods of life,\r\nand as it usually occurs but once in the same individual, it is clear\r\nthat the apparent diminution of susceptibility in later years may be\r\nlargely due to the fact that most persons have had the disease in\r\nchildhood. More children are attacked from one to five years, and the\r\ndisease is more prevalent in summer and fall months. Causes which,\r\nlike exposure to inclement weather, give rise to irritation of the\r\nbronchial mucous membrane, or diseases which, as measles, are\r\naccompanied with catarrhal symptoms and susceptibility of the\r\nbronchial mucous membrane, also may serve as predisposing causes. Sex\r\nappears to exert some positive influence. Of 360 cases of pertussis by\r\nDessau,[3] the total number of males were 154, that of females 206.\r\nGirls are more {840} frequently attacked than boys, in proportion of 2\r\nto 1.50; this seems true at all ages; this statement is substantiated\r\nby Unruh of Dresden, based on an analysis of 1952 cases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _N.Y. Jour. of Obst._, 1881, xiv. 490-503.]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--The disease begins usually with an ordinary catarrh,\r\npreceded by malaise and slight laryngeal irritation, which may be\r\noverlooked; in fact, during the first stage there is nothing to\r\nattract special attention, unless a direct history of exposure be\r\nknown and suspicion be aroused on that account. Meigs and Pepper state\r\nthat the earliest period at which they have known the distinctive\r\nwhoop of the disease was three days, though in a great many instances\r\nit was delayed as late as three weeks. The same authors state that the\r\nordinary duration of a paroxysm or kink is from one-fourth to\r\nthree-fourths of a minute. They mention a case where the paroxysm\r\nlasted fifty-five minutes. Ordinarily they number about thirty-five or\r\nforty during the twenty-four hours at the height of the disease,\r\ndiffering greatly in individuals. Their number is most frequent in the\r\ncourse of the third or fourth week, after which they remain\r\nstationary, and then gradually decline. The paroxysms may occur\r\nspontaneously, or they may follow some irritation, either direct or\r\nreflex, or they may be induced by nervous excitement. Toward the end\r\nof the attack, after the catarrhal irritation has greatly subsided, or\r\nin fact has entirely disappeared, the paroxysmal kinks may be provoked\r\nby irritation of the fauces, and also by nervous excitement; and there\r\nis no question but that at this time they can be controlled by\r\nwill-power. In many cases a distinct relapse occurs after the disease\r\nhas been apparently cured.\r\n\r\nDolan believes the phenomena of the cough or kinks to be due, as\r\nsuggested by Laennec, to a \"spasmodic condition of the muscular or\r\ncontractile fibres of the bronchi and their branches.\" He remarks that\r\nthe lungs are supplied from the anterior and posterior pulmonary\r\nplexuses, formed chiefly of branches from the sympathetic and\r\npneumogastrics. The filaments from these accompany the bronchial tubes\r\nupon which they are lost. Irritation of these nerves is said to have\r\nthe effect of producing contractions of the bronchial canals\r\nsufficient to expel a certain quantity of air. If this theory is true,\r\nit helps us in explaining why the large, mediate, and smaller bronchi\r\nare closed during the expiratory stage of the paroxysmal cough of\r\npertussis. The general opinion seems to be that the pneumogastric\r\nnerve is not inflamed, as has been asserted by some.\r\n\r\nThe highly sensitive condition of the nervous system, which is\r\nprobably in a great measure intensified by the anæmia, and by the\r\ninterference with nutrition due to the disturbance of the circulation\r\nby the cough, will show itself in many ways, and even when no\r\nsecondary nervous affections complicate the attack or follow it. Some\r\ntime will elapse after the disease has passed away before the child\r\nwill recover its self-control, or its nutrition will show the\r\ninfluence of a healthy nervous system. The total duration of the\r\naffection is said to vary from six weeks to three months in ordinary\r\ncases; though probably, if active treatment could be instituted early\r\nenough and kept up with thoroughness, there is no specific disease\r\nmore capable of being shortened in its course than the one under\r\nconsideration; this remains, however, for future statistics to decide.\r\n\r\nDuring the second stage of the disease the symptoms are sufficiently\r\n{841} marked to attract attention and render a diagnosis easy to make.\r\nFrequently the catarrh seems to extend to the bronchioles, and gives\r\nrise to symptoms that are alarming; and the intensity of the paroxysm\r\nwill cause the engorgement of the blood-vessels to get relief in\r\nprofuse hemorrhage; this is the period for caution. Complications may\r\narise, the strength may fail, the secretions may become too abundant,\r\nand asphyxia may ensue; emphysema may show itself, or catarrhal\r\npneumonia may gradually supervene.\r\n\r\nThe period of decline is very gradual; the secretions become less in\r\nquantity and more viscid, the paroxysmal cough is less frequent, but\r\nmay at times be equally severe, the child's strength is usually\r\nexhausted, and its nutrition is greatly impaired. The expected\r\nparoxysm throws it into a state of intense nervous excitement; it is\r\nsleepless--in fact, worn out. Probably at this period of the disease\r\ntreatment will show the most marked results, and the long lists of\r\nsedatives, tonics, etc. which are presented to us by their zealous\r\nadvocates owe much of their popularity to their value at this stage of\r\nthe disease. The catarrhal symptoms are the first to subside; the\r\nnervous disturbances remain for some time, and gradually fade, and the\r\nconstitutional symptoms, or those from exhaustion, are the last to\r\nleave the patient.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the heart appears to suffer but little in the\r\nlong run from the great strain upon it; the palpitation and\r\nirregularity of its actions are not followed by structural changes as\r\na rule, though we may state that feebleness of the circulation has\r\nremained in most of our bad cases for some months after recovery.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ulceration of the frænum linguæ, which has given rise\r\nto so much discussion as to its exact value as a symptom of this\r\ndisease, our own experience leads us to believe that though it is\r\nnearly always present in the severe cases, its almost invariable\r\nabsence before dentition and in milder cases shows it to be of\r\ntraumatic origin. Roger's exhaustive report before the French Academy\r\nsupported this view, and showed how clearly it is caused by the\r\nviolent rubbing of the frænum on the free border of the incisors. On\r\nthe other hand, Delthil of Paris and Blake of England believe that it\r\nis a pathological feature of the disease. The former reported cases in\r\nwhich it occurred before dentition. The ulcer is not always found on\r\nthe frænum linguæ, but is found on either side of it. Bouffier noted\r\nsevere cases of ulceration in children who had no teeth, but he\r\nattributed it to the injury produced by the mother in detaching the\r\nmucus with the finger.\r\n\r\nExaminations of the urine have been carefully made by many observers.\r\nThe appearance of sugar, about which so much has been said, does not\r\nseem to be constant, or even very frequent. Out of 50 cases, Dolan\r\nfound traces of it in but 13. This coincides with our experience also,\r\nfor we have frequently tested the urine in seven cases with negative\r\nresults. Since, as is well known, irritation of the pneumogastric\r\ncentre may cause glycosuria, it was at one time attempted to show that\r\nthe paroxysms in whooping cough were due to congestion of the\r\npneumogastric nerves, a condition which is said to have been\r\noccasionally found in this disease. Dolan says he has never seen\r\nhemorrhage from the kidneys during the course of whooping cough, nor\r\nblood in the urine.\r\n\r\nMORTALITY.--It is an extremely difficult matter to reach, with any\r\n{842} degree of certainty, the true mortality of this affection. Meigs\r\nand Pepper say: \"Of the 208 cases observed by ourselves, 143 were\r\nsimple, all of which recovered;\" and, again, \"Some form of\r\ncomplication occurred in the 65 of the 208 cases observed by\r\nourselves; of these 65, 12 died.\" The mortality seems greater under\r\nfive years; thus: Of the 9008 deaths attributed to it in the United\r\nStates during the census year ending June 1, 1870, the number of\r\npersons under one year of age was 4424, and 8396 were under five\r\nyears. There were 1784 deaths from it recorded in Philadelphia from\r\n1860 to 1876; of this number, 1724 were under five years of age. The\r\ncensus of the United States for 1880 gives a return of 11,102 deaths\r\nfrom this disease.\r\n\r\nFemales seem more liable to die of it than males; of the 1784 deaths\r\nin this city, 766 were males and 1018 females. As we have already\r\nseen, females are more liable to the disease than males.\r\n\r\nRobt. J. Lee, M.D.,[4] says that from the Registrar-General's report\r\nof 1876 it is seen that in a total mortality in England of 510,315,\r\nwhooping cough was returned as the cause of death in 10,554 cases, or\r\nnearly 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In a paper in the _British Med. Jour._, 1879, vol. i. p.\r\n307.]\r\n\r\nAs for the time of year, we quote the following: \"Thus, according to\r\nthe census statistics, most deaths occur in the spring, there being a\r\nrise up to the middle of May. From the middle of May the number\r\nlessens largely until August, when a rise occurs and continues until\r\nOctober, when a decline sets in and continues until December, when a\r\nrise begins and goes on increasing until the middle of May. This rise\r\nin mortality from August to October is attributed to the wear and tear\r\nof a hot summer and the intestinal troubles then so prevalent.\"\r\n\r\nThe mortality statistics of this disease are uncertain. It is fatal in\r\nits complications or by inducing a debilitated condition which invites\r\ndegenerative processes. The severity of the symptoms is no guide for\r\nprognosis as far as uncomplicated cases are concerned, and there is no\r\ndoubt but that at present we are able to greatly reduce the\r\nmortality-rate by care and medical treatment, as well as to shorten\r\nthe attack. Sporadic cases are apt to be neglected until they become\r\ncomplicated. When the disease occurs in epidemic form, measles is\r\noften prevalent simultaneously, and in consequence children who become\r\naffected by both diseases have a greater tendency, from debility, to\r\nbecome the victims of those affections of the respiratory organs which\r\nare such frequent and fatal complications of both maladies.\r\n\r\nInstead of surprise at the mortality of this affection, the marvel is\r\nthat so large a percentage of recoveries take place, when we consider\r\nthat we are dealing with a disease whose lesion is a catarrh of the\r\nair-passages which seldom lasts less than two months, with a tendency\r\nto involve the lungs in one way or another, and then witness the\r\ncarelessness with which, among the lower classes, the child is often\r\ntreated--exposed to all weathers, under-clothed, under-fed, and\r\nprobably allowed to pass through the whole attack without medical\r\ntreatment. Taking this into consideration, the probability is that the\r\nmortality of this disease could be reduced to a very small figure by\r\ncareful management, even if the investigations of those now seeking\r\nthe microbe of pertussis do not lead to any plan, in accordance with\r\nPasteur's teachings, which will still further lessen the gravity of\r\nthe disease. Until {843} then, we can but insist upon a rigid\r\nquarantine of schools, a registration of all cases, and the seclusion\r\nof them, as we have done to-day in the case of variola and scarlatina.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--Although whooping cough is a serious disease, the\r\ncause of death is generally found to be dependent upon its\r\ncomplications, and there is no lesion at all characteristic of it. The\r\nchief complications and sequelæ are--bronchitis, which may become\r\ncapillary; lobular collapse, which, according to Alderson,[5] is\r\nfrequently found; emphysema, usually marginal, probably due, as\r\nsuggested by Jenner, to violent expiratory exertions; rupture of\r\nair-vesicles, with subcutaneous emphysema; catarrhal pneumonia,\r\npleurisy, phthisis, acute tuberculosis, croup, cerebral apoplexy,\r\nmeningitis, etc. As any of these complications, and others which may\r\narise from debility, may be the cause of death, independent of the\r\naction of the specific poison itself, it is usual to divide the\r\npost-mortem appearances into those that are the result of the\r\nextension of the catarrh itself and those produced by the interference\r\nwith the circulation and with nutrition from mechanical violence. Of\r\nthe former, the usual causes of death are pneumonia, gastritis and\r\nenteritis. Of the latter, we have thrombosis of the cerebral sinuses,\r\nhemorrhages, emphysema, and exhaustion following constant vomiting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Medico-Chir. Trans._, pp. 90, 91, 1830.]\r\n\r\nTubercular disease of the lungs or of the brain is apt to be a cause\r\nof death. Convulsions carried off 5 of the 12 fatal cases reported out\r\nof 208 by Meigs and Pepper. This may be due to congestion of the\r\nbrain, especially in teething children. Spasm of the glottis with\r\nsudden death is occasionally found. In such cases there is found\r\nintense congestion of the brain, also of the liver and kidneys, and at\r\ntimes of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, as well as\r\nof that of the respiratory tract.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, especially at the teething age, sudden death may occur\r\nbecause effusion into the ventricles of the brain or the formation of\r\nheart-clot has taken place. It is important to know this, that active\r\ntreatment applied early enough may save the patient.\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS.--Should the interesting and seemingly conclusive\r\nstatements of Dolan and the microscopic investigations of Carl\r\nBruger[6] receive the endorsement of future workers, the subject of\r\nprophylaxis will assume a degree of importance which hitherto it has\r\nonly maintained with the medical profession. No one has doubted that\r\nthe disease was contagious, and yet there is no affection which has\r\nattached to it a corresponding fatality that is so carelessly dealt\r\nwith as pertussis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Bruger of Bonn, in the _Berliner klinische Wochen._,\r\ndescribes at length the special micro-organisms of pertussis. They\r\nappear as small elongated elliptical bodies of unequal length, the\r\nsmallest being double as long as broad. High powers show subdivisions\r\nin the largest specimens. They are generally isolated, but may appear\r\nin groups. They bear some resemblance to _Leptothrix buccalis_, the\r\nspores of which are often found in whooping-cough sputa. Occasionally\r\nthe bacillus is seen inside the mucous corpuscle in the sputum. They\r\nstain in the usual way, fuschin and methyl violet. This bacillus is\r\nnot found in any other kind of sputum, is very abundant in pertussis,\r\nand increases in direct proportion to the severity of the disease.]\r\n\r\nWithin the past few days we have heard on two occasions in crowded\r\nrailway-cars the characteristic paroxysm of the third stage of the\r\ndisease, and yet people will endeavor to convince themselves that\r\nunless contact with the child takes place the danger is little.\r\n\r\n{844} The atmosphere in school-rooms, railway-cars, and places of\r\namusement which are badly ventilated, is an excellent medium for the\r\npropagation of the contagious matter, and many extraordinary cases are\r\non record of momentary exposure being sufficient to contract the\r\ndisease. Believing that the contagium or virus resides in the mucus\r\nand air thrown off by the child, and also in the vomited matters,\r\nwhich contain a large amount of ropy mucus, and also that it gains\r\nentrance by means of the respiratory organs, protection from contagion\r\ndivides itself as follows: thorough disinfection of the exhaled air,\r\nof the mucus remaining within the bronchial tubes and air-passages,\r\nand of the clothing, together with exposure to fresh air and thorough\r\ncleansing of all furniture and household utensils, including cups,\r\nsilverware, and toys, used by the child. Oxygen is said to have this\r\neffect, and thorough, constant ventilation, with the breathing of\r\nfresh air by the child, the thorough washing of its surface, and\r\ndisinfection of its clothing, are the first indications; while the\r\nimpregnation of the atmosphere with the spray of well-known germicides\r\nby means of the steam or other atomizer and the frequent inhalation of\r\nsuch materials by the patient are no less important. Every case of\r\nwhooping cough should be compelled to use two or three times daily the\r\nspray impregnated with a substance of this sort, either carbolic acid,\r\nthe oil of eucalyptus, a solution of quinia, or thymol. Chlorine (from\r\nchloride of lime) used thus has of late been followed by excellent\r\nresults, and the spray of a solution of corrosive sublimate or of\r\nammonium chloride has been found very useful. The protective treatment\r\nshould be applied to those exposed to contagion. Such children should\r\nbe guarded from exposure to colds; their diet should be simple and\r\nnourishing, their clothing warm; they should be kept as much as\r\npossible in the open air. The breathing of air impregnated with such\r\nsubstances as above mentioned will no doubt act upon the virus before\r\nit comes in contact with the mucous membranes so as to be absorbed,\r\nand probably the severity of the attack might be mitigated by\r\nmodifying the germ of the disease.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--As can be readily imagined, a disease which is so\r\nuniversal, so distressing, and at the same time so obscure in its\r\npathology, as the one under consideration, would have in its\r\nliterature a mass of recommendations for treatment from zealous\r\nadvocates, based upon theory or experience, as numerous as the authors\r\nthemselves. It would be impossible for us to dwell at length upon all\r\nof these, but we will confine ourselves especially to the\r\nconsideration of a few of the most important. It will be convenient to\r\nconsider first those remedies which have been used with the view of\r\nrelieving the congestion and irritability of the respiratory mucous\r\nmembrane and of promoting more free secretion. It will also be\r\nobserved that many of these remedies may now be regarded as of value\r\nfor destroying the special germ which is thought to be the essential\r\ncause and real virus of pertussis. Allusion has been made above to the\r\nimportance of inhalations as a prophylactic for those who have been\r\nexposed to the contagion, as well as for the purpose of rendering the\r\nsecretions less contagious; and so too we find that the inhalation of\r\nvarious substances has received favor with many as a method of\r\ntreatment. Thus, hyoscyamus, belladonna, ammonium bromide have been\r\nused. Helenke and Serbaud say that bromide of {845} potassium is best\r\nfor inhalation. Letzerich recommended the insufflation of quinia twice\r\ndaily, using the quinia muriate with potassium bicarbonate and\r\ngum-arabic. Forchheimer[7] reports 97 cases of whooping cough treated\r\nby the insufflation of the quinia muriate; of the 97 cases, 52 were\r\nfemales, 45 males--the youngest three weeks, the oldest nine years\r\nold. Five cases gave no results, while in the others benefit was shown\r\nby a shortening or amelioration of the disease. The vapor of benzole\r\nhas been used with good results. The vapor of carbolic acid has of\r\nlate been highly recommended, either administered with the atomizer\r\nseveral times daily, or used by saturating flannels in carbolic acid\r\nsolution and placed around the child's bed at night. It is said that\r\nthe inhalation of the vapor of a few drops of carbolic acid on some\r\nhot coals will ensure a night of freedom from violent coughing.\r\nProbably in this way we may account for the belief that proximity to\r\ngas-works is beneficial to a child with this disease. As is well\r\nknown, Niemeyer and others in the north of Germany believed in the\r\nvalue of the inhalation of oxygen, and the experience of every one who\r\nhas had much to do with this disease favors an out-door life. We may\r\nhere also mention the value of a small quantity of chloroform or\r\nether, by inhalation, in allaying the severity of the paroxysms of\r\ncough. We have also tried the nitrate of amyl, but without marked\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _New York Jour. Obstet._, 1882.]\r\n\r\nOthers have recommended the use of solutions of various substances,\r\napplied directly by a brush to the interior of the larynx. Quinia has\r\nbeen used in this way also by Hagenbach; but the most satisfactory\r\nresults have been obtained by the application of very weak solutions\r\nof nitrate of silver, as first recommended by Watson in 1849.\r\n\r\nAfter the secretions have been fully established and the\r\ncharacteristic whoop has appeared, the indications in the treatment\r\nare to relieve the respiratory tract of its burden by occasional\r\nemesis with alum or ipecacuanha, to give freely antispasmodics and\r\nsedatives, as belladonna, chloral, the bromides, hydrobromic acid, or,\r\nas recommended by some, digitalis; to give quinia freely, and to use\r\ncounter-irritants to the neck and chest with liniments composed of oil\r\nof amber, croton oil, or turpentine.\r\n\r\nThe value of emetics has been long recognized in this affection,\r\nalthough we are told by Vogel that the continuous use of emetics in\r\nthe early stage for several days causes harm. Copeland ordered an\r\nemetic every third day in ordinary cases. All writers agree that the\r\nmilder emetics should be used by preference; that tartar emetic should\r\nbe avoided, except as an external application where a counter-irritant\r\nis desired; and that ipecacuanha is the safest, though alum is also\r\nsafe and as an astringent useful. Trousseau preferred the sulphate of\r\ncopper. In the earlier stages of the disease emetics are not, as a\r\nrule, indicated; it is only when the secretion has become extremely\r\ntenacious, and the paroxysms so frequent and severe as to greatly\r\nstrain the patient and endanger his lungs, that they are of value.\r\nThere seems to be a close connection between the amount and tenacity\r\nof the secretion and the severity of the paroxysm. The potassium\r\ncarbonate has been recommended as an active agent in the amelioration\r\nof this affection; it is probably valuable in rendering the secretion\r\nless tenacious. Alum has been used with success, as has tannin,\r\nprobably owing to their local action on the mucous membrane.\r\nMacartan[8] says that in the East {846} Indies the disease is treated\r\nin the first stages by astringent and tonic gargles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Dictionnaire des Sciences Méd._, 1813, vol. vi.]\r\n\r\nBelladonna certainly receives the endorsement of the greatest number\r\nof writers. Vogel considers it superior to all other drugs, and\r\nregards dilatation of the pupil as the only sure guide in its\r\nadministration. He says it does not cut short the attack, but\r\nmitigates the paroxysm. Trousseau was also an advocate of this form of\r\ntreatment. When combined with alum[9] it is considered by Meigs and\r\nPepper to be one of the most valuable drugs recommended. They also\r\nadvise the use of potassium carbonate. Seiner trusted belladonna more\r\nthan any other remedy; so also Rilliet and Barthez. William Lee, in an\r\ninteresting paper in the _New York Medical Journal_, 1883, advocates\r\nthe use of atropia hypodermically; he believes that atropia chiefly\r\nacts in these cases on the laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric\r\nnerves, and that it is probable that it has a decided effect also on\r\nthe medulla oblongata itself, and renders it less capable of exciting\r\nreflex action. Kroon's experiments led him to conclude that the\r\nvalerianate of atropia was the most useful. Evans[10] gave the 1/120\r\nof a grain of atropia to a child aged three years until the pupils\r\nwere dilated, then reduced the dose; this stopped the paroxysm in\r\ntwenty-one days. At the commencement of the treatment the child had\r\ntwenty-three paroxysms in the day, and twenty-seven at night. Case No.\r\n2 under same circumstances recovered in fourteen days. In case No. 3\r\nthe paroxysms were reduced from twenty-six to two or three a day.\r\nArthur Wiglesworth[11] used a solution of sulphate of atropia,\r\nadministered in the morning fasting; the dose he advises for children\r\nfrom one to four years is gr. 1/120, given only once a day except in\r\nsome cases. The results are as follows: There is a steady diminution\r\nin the number of paroxysms; a change in the character of the whoop as\r\nif the vocal cords were not so closely approximated. If atropia is\r\nwithheld, the beneficent effect derived from it subsides.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Golding Bird, _Guy's Hosp. Rep._, April, 1845.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Glasgow Med. Jour._, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Lancet_, April 12, 1879.]\r\n\r\nWest advises dilute hydrocyanic acid, and many writers agree with him,\r\nranking it next to belladonna.\r\n\r\nHarley and others are strong advocates for the bromide of ammonium; it\r\nis supposed to have a local anæsthetic action on the pharyngeal and\r\nlaryngeal mucous membrane. Fordyce Grinnell[12] during four months\r\ntreated 223 cases with this remedy, and highly recommends it. The\r\ndoses were in accordance with those of Dr. Kormann--3/4 to 4 grains,\r\nas indicated by age, three or four times a day and at night when the\r\nparoxysms were severe. No other treatment was used in these 223 cases,\r\nexcept camphorated oil to the throat and chest in some cases.\r\nPotassium bromide has been recommended by Helenke, Beaufort,\r\nErlenmeyer, and others. Henry Field[13] recommends sodium bromide.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Med. News_, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Brit. Med. Jour._]\r\n\r\nProbably next to belladonna in the treatment of this disease we should\r\nplace chloral hydrate.\r\n\r\nHebner, after an elaborate study of the relative value of potassium\r\nbromide, quinia, salicylic acid, chloral, and belladonna, says:\r\n\"Salicylic acid and chloral tend to relieve the paroxysms--belladonna\r\nand quinia to shorten the disease.\" Kennedy[14] writes: \"I cannot\r\ndoubt {847} its specific effects on the cough. Chloral seems to me to\r\nyield the best and most constant results. The advantage of chloral\r\nhydrate seems to exist in producing sleep; it should be given in from\r\n2- to 5-gr. doses, at night.\" If there is much irritability or\r\nfretfulness, or any premonition of eclampsia, it should be associated\r\nwith potassium bromide.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Dublin Jour. M. S._, 1881.]\r\n\r\nCroton chloral has received much praise from those who have used it;\r\nwe have had no experience with it.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the value of quinia, which has been used\r\nlargely in this disease, both internally and as a local application.\r\nOriginally recommended in the latter manner on account of its power of\r\ncontrolling the development of low organisms, it has not proved so\r\nsatisfactory or valuable as when given internally. Binz in 1870 was\r\nperhaps the first to recommend quinia given frequently and in\r\nsolution, and Dawson in 1873[15] reports excellent results from the\r\nsulphate or muriate of quinia given in full and frequent doses, and in\r\nsuch solutions as will not prevent its acting on the mucous membrane\r\nin its passage through the pharynx. Breidenbach[16] gives the quinia\r\nmuriate in larger doses--one and a half to fifteen and a half grains\r\nper diem. The effects were surprising as soon as the proper dose for\r\neach person had been determined; this, he says, is the keynote of\r\nsuccess. To prevent complications he continued it for a long time in\r\nsmall doses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Am. Jour. Obstetrics._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Practitioner_, Feb., 1871.]\r\n\r\nOur own experience favors the view that quinia, when given in solution\r\nor suspended in mixture, is valuable in many cases of this disease; it\r\ncan be ordered in powder, and given in a spoonful of simple syrup or\r\nof the preparation known as the syrup of yerba santa, which makes an\r\nexcellent vehicle. Liquorice also disguises the taste of quinia\r\nadmirably for children.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht[17] has found from an experience of ten cases of whooping\r\ncough in children between the ages of one and a half and nine years,\r\nall of a marked scrofulous type, much benefit from the muriate of\r\npilocarpine, given in small doses after every fit of coughing. To\r\nprevent collapse, he advises that it should be given in a mixture\r\ncontaining a little brandy. After twenty-four hours of its\r\nadministration an obvious change for the better takes place in the\r\nappearance of the mucous membrane of the throat, velum palati, and\r\nuvula, which becomes paler, less swollen, and more moist;\r\nlaryngoscopic examination shows a similar improvement. During the\r\ncatarrhal period cold compresses to the neck and sweetened milk\r\ncontaining potassium chlorate are used instead of the pilocarpine,\r\nwhich is to be resumed as soon as a whoop recurs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _London Med. Rec._, March 15, 1882, p. 110.]\r\n\r\nDr. Tordeus, of the Hospice des Enfants Assistés, Brussels, states\r\nthat he has found the sodium benzoate useful in whooping cough,\r\ndiminishing the frequency and violence of the paroxysms, and by its\r\naction on the pulmonary mucous membrane preventing those pulmonary\r\ncomplications which so frequently supervene and constitute the danger\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\nSulphur has been largely used by the Germans in two- or three-grain\r\ndoses, and is said to be greatly esteemed by them. Cantharides has\r\nbeen recommended, and it is stated that when strangury is produced the\r\nwhoop will cease; we should consider this rather severe treatment. The\r\n{848} fluid extract of castanea is used by many with undoubtedly good\r\nresults, though this also has been somewhat of a disappointment in the\r\nway of treatment, as at one time it was looked upon almost as a\r\nspecific. Many claim that an infusion of the fresh leaves gives a\r\nbetter result. Dewar[18] regards ergot with great favor in the\r\ntreatment of pertussis. Certainly in those cases where, from violent\r\nstraining, hemorrhages have taken place we have found it to be highly\r\nvaluable. We have had no experience with it in the treatment of\r\nordinary cases, though Dewar claims that it shortens the attack. The\r\nammonium picrate, and recently resorcine, have been used with success.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _The Practitioner_, London, May, 1882.]\r\n\r\nCounter-irritation to the neck and chest has always been found useful\r\nin the treatment of this disease. Autenreith[19] recommends tartar\r\nemetic to the epigastrium till vesicles appear and even ulcerate.\r\nMilder forms of counter-irritation over the chest seem equally\r\nefficacious if continued for some time. The oil of amber, when used in\r\nliniment with camphor or turpentine, is by some considered almost a\r\nspecific. Great care should also be observed in the dress of children\r\nwith whooping cough. Warmth about the chest is always indicated, while\r\nthere should be nothing close or tight about the throat allowed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Dict. des Sciences Med._, 1813.]\r\n\r\nIn the third stage, when there is the nervous element remaining,\r\ntonics, such as cod-liver oil, iron, the phosphates and\r\nhypophosphites, are required.\r\n\r\nThe diet should be nutritious, easy of digestion, and abundant, and\r\nthe bowels should be kept regular by fruits or laxatives. Over-feeding\r\nshould of course always be avoided, and the attempt at weaning a babe\r\nwith this disease would certainly meet with unfavorable results.\r\n\r\nBicarbonate of soda or lime-water should be given freely with the milk\r\ntaken by children with this disease. Milk certainly should form the\r\nbasis of the diet of children with pertussis, and reliable\r\nmeat-extracts are to be recommended in this disease even for older\r\nchildren, who from the severity of the attack would vomit more solid\r\nfood. If the vomiting be so severe as to affect nutrition, the child\r\nshould be sustained by peptonized milk, soup, or gruel, given by the\r\nbowel.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a proper regulation of the temperature of the air\r\nwhich the patient breathes is especially recognized in France. If the\r\nattack occurs in mid-winter and the seashore be inaccessible or\r\ninexpedient, the child should be restricted to a well-ventilated\r\nnursery or suite of rooms, the temperature of which should be kept\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nSalt air is recognized to be of great value in advanced cases of this\r\ndisease; this has been attributed partly to the effects of stimulation\r\nof the mucous membrane in rendering less viscid and more copious the\r\nbronchial secretions, and also to the balmy softness and great purity\r\nof the atmosphere at the sea-shore. But probably there is another\r\nelement in the local action of the chloride of sodium, either in\r\nestablishing a resistance on the part of the patient or in modifying\r\nthe germ of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe most serious complication of whooping cough is pneumonia. It\r\noccasionally happens that an attack of croupous pneumonia may develop\r\nduring the course of whooping cough, but in the vast majority of cases\r\nthe disease is of the catarrhal type. When, indeed, it is remembered\r\nthat a bronchial catarrh, which is the invariable precursor or\r\naccompaniment {849} of catarrhal pneumonia, is a constant factor in\r\nwhooping cough, and, further, that all conditions of debility, and\r\nespecially of enfeebled or embarrassed respiration, dispose to this\r\nform of pneumonia, it is not surprising that this complication should\r\nbe of such frequent occurrence. It is not impossible that in aiming at\r\nsecuring sufficient fresh air and out-door exercise to maintain the\r\ngeneral health, an injudicious degree of exposure may be permitted\r\nwhich will aggravate the existing bronchitis and induce an extension\r\nof inflammation to the alveoli. But usually the catarrhal pneumonia\r\ndevelops in a subacute and more or less insidious manner, and without\r\nbeing traceable to any such exposure. It may happen occasionally that\r\nin the violent inspiratory efforts at the close of the paroxysms\r\nirritating secretions may be sucked from the bronchioles into the\r\nalveoli, and there excite inflammation. Or, again, it doubtless\r\nhappens frequently that, with the existence of swelling of the\r\nbronchial mucous membrane and of viscid secretions in the bronchial\r\ntubes, collapse of portions of lung tissue is developed by the\r\nforcible expulsion of air during the paroxysms of cough, which cannot\r\nbe replaced owing to the relative weakness of inspiration and to the\r\nball-valve action of the plugs of mucus in the obstructed bronchioles.\r\nThe intimate relation between pulmonary collapse and catarrhal\r\npneumonia is familiarly known. It is not to be considered that the\r\nmere occurrence of collapse will induce pneumonia in the areas\r\naffected, but certainly it will aid in rendering effective the other\r\nirritating causes. As a consequence, it usually happens that when\r\ncatarrhal pneumonia occurs in whooping cough it is associated with\r\nmore or less collapse. When, then, especially in children of\r\ndebilitated or rachitic constitution, or in those who are subjected to\r\nunfavorable hygienic influences, such as overcrowding, bad air, and\r\nthe like, there is a rather gradual development of dyspnoea, with\r\nincreasing debility, emaciation, and evidences of impaired oxygenation\r\nof the blood, it is to be feared that this serious complication has\r\ndeveloped. The physical signs are often difficult of interpretation,\r\nbut if careful examination of the chest be conducted, together with\r\nthermometric observations, the approach of this danger or its actual\r\npresence may be detected. The result is fatal in a large proportion of\r\ncases, so that suitable treatment--for the details of which reference\r\nis made to the appropriate section--must be instituted without delay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur investigations of this disease have led us to the conclusion that\r\nwe have to deal with an affection caused by a specific germ, which is\r\nusually, after a period of incubation, made manifest by a catarrh of a\r\nportion of the air-passages; that this catarrh, existing for an\r\nindefinite period, is capable of being influenced by medication,\r\napplied either by means of inhalation or by acting on the mucous\r\nmembrane after absorption by the stomach. In this way we have known\r\nthe administration of quinia and of alum diminish the number of\r\nparoxysms, to all appearance checking the excessive secretion to a\r\nmarvellous extent. The other element of the disease, the neurosis,\r\nwhich soon follows the initial catarrh, and seems to last for an\r\nindefinite time after the mucous membrane has regained its normal\r\nappearance, is also capable of being controlled by the use of drugs,\r\nespecially belladonna, chloral, the bromides, and hydrocyanic acid,\r\nnot to speak of the other antispasmodics and sedatives, and by the\r\n{850} analgesic effect of carbonic acid gas, or by the spray of\r\nbromide of ammonium, carbolic acid, and other substances upon the\r\nlarynx.\r\n\r\nVogel tells us in his classical work on children, \"If now, as a\r\nrésumé, I would give an explanation of my views, it would go to show\r\nthat there never has been, and most probably never will be, a remedy\r\nby which whooping cough may be abridged, any more than we are able to\r\ncut short the acute exanthemata or typhus fever or pneumonia.\" And yet\r\nthe experience of many whom we have quoted in this article tends to\r\nsupport the view that by a form of treatment calculated to act on the\r\ntwo elements of the disease which we have just noted, the affection\r\ncan be greatly modified in its intensity, and probably the attack be\r\nsomewhat shortened. Certain it is that the recent studies of this\r\ndisease give us hope that the day is not far distant when the cause,\r\nwhatever it is, will be definitely known, and if it is found to reside\r\nin the secretions from the larynx, that treatment by inhalation or\r\natomization will modify or destroy it, and prevent its dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{851}\r\n\r\nINFLUENZA.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES C. WILSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A continued fever, occurring in widely-extended\r\nepidemics, and due to a specific cause; it is characterized by early\r\ncatarrh of the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, and in many\r\ncases also of the digestive tract; by quickly oncoming debility out of\r\nproportion to the intensity of the fever and the catarrhal processes;\r\nand by nervous symptoms. There is a strong tendency to inflammatory\r\ncomplications, especially of the lungs. Uncomplicated cases are rarely\r\nfatal except in feeble and aged persons. An attack does not confer\r\nimmunity from the disease in future epidemics.\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Febris catarrhalis; Defluxio catarrhalis epidemicus;\r\nCatarrhus a contagio; Rheuma epidemicum; Cephalalgia contagiosa;\r\nEpidemic catarrhal fever; Tac; Horion; Quinte; Coqueluche; Ladendo,\r\nalso written La Dando; Baraquette; Générale; Coquette; Cocotte;\r\nAllure; Follette; Petite poste; Petit courier; Grenade; La Grippe;\r\nZiep; Schaffhusten and Schaffkrankheit; Huhner-Weh; Blitz-Katarrh;\r\nMödefieber; Mal del Castrone. There are also several names indicating\r\nits supposed origin; thus it has been called in Russia, Chinese\r\ncatarrh; in Germany and Italy, the Russian disease; in France, Italian\r\nfever, Spanish catarrh, and so forth.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that in two instances at least the popular\r\nname for the disease under consideration has found its way widely into\r\nmedicine and medical literature, almost to the exclusion of the\r\nstudied terms by which science has sought to designate it; these are\r\ninfluenza and la grippe.\r\n\r\nSuch obsolete and now meaningless terms as Peripneumonia notha\r\n(Sydenham, Boerhaave), Peripneumonia catarrhalis (Huxham), Pleuritis\r\nhumida (Stoll), have been omitted from this list of synonyms as being\r\nof interest rather to the student of medical history than to the\r\nstudent of medicine.\r\n\r\nFebris catarrhalis, Defluxio catarrhalis epidemicus, Rheuma epidemicus\r\nare terms which no longer retain the place given them in the\r\nliterature of influenza by the older medical authorities.\r\n\r\nCatarrhis a contagio (Cullen) and Cephalalgia contagiosa are derived\r\nfrom a view of the nature of the disease, which has been the cause of\r\nno little controversy.\r\n\r\nEpidemic catarrhal fever is, with its Latin equivalent, the most\r\nsatisfactory of the so-called scientific names by which the disease is\r\nat present known.\r\n\r\nIn the popular names for the affection there is to be noted an {852}\r\nindication of the national character of some of the peoples who have\r\nsuffered from its frequent visitations.\r\n\r\nAmong the English it is known as cold or epidemic cold, or, in\r\ndeference to medical authority, as catarrh or epidemic catarrh; and at\r\npresent, both among the folk and the doctors, as influenza. Englishmen\r\nare neither quick to see in the disease a resemblance to some common\r\ncircumstance or thing, nor are they disposed to make a joke about it.\r\n\r\nThe Germans find obvious resemblances. In the labored respiration and\r\nthe character of the cough they find a suggestion of a common\r\nepizoötic affecting the sheep, hence Schaffhusten and Shaffkrankheit;\r\nor, because the cough is like the crowing of a cock and the\r\ndisturbance of respiration and rapid prostration suggest some\r\nresemblance to a common disease of the domestic fowl, it has been\r\ncalled Huhner-Weh (chicken disease, whooping cough), and Ziep, which\r\nis about equivalent to pip. They call it also, from its rapid\r\ninvasion, Blitz-Katarrh, and from its diffusion, Mödefieber.\r\n\r\nThe French are disposed to make a jest of everything, and the more\r\nserious the subject the better the joke. Hence they have found a new\r\nname for almost every great epidemic, and each more trivial than the\r\nlast. Thus, tac (rot); horion (in jest, a blow); quinte, because the\r\nspells occur at intervals of five hours (sic); coqueluche (a hood or\r\ncowl), from the cap worn by those suffering from the malady; and so on\r\nthrough the long list given above.\r\n\r\nLa grippe is said to be derived from the Polish Chrypka (Raucedo); it\r\nmay, however, be derived from agripper (to seize).\r\n\r\nInfluenza is of Italian derivation. It is said that the disease\r\nreceived this name because it was attributed to the influence of the\r\nstars, or from a secondary signification of the word indicating\r\nsomething fluid, transient, or fashionable.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SKETCH.[1]--Epidemics of influenza have been clearly\r\nrecorded only since the beginning of the sixteenth century. There are\r\nnumerous accounts of earlier epidemic diseases resembling it, but they\r\nare not sufficiently particular to warrant us in inferring its\r\nundoubted existence. It is supposed to be referred to in the writings\r\nof Hippocrates, who, however, gives no exact description.[2] An\r\noutbreak in the Athenian army in Sicily (415 B.C.), recorded by\r\nDiodorus Siculus, has been supposed to have been influenza. Despite\r\nthese statements, and those of others to the effect that it is a\r\ndisease known from a remote antiquity, it may be said that no accounts\r\ncan be confidently established, as referring to the disease now known\r\nas influenza, in the writings of classical antiquity.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See also _The Continued Fevers_, by the author of this\r\npaper, New York, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Parkes, _Reynolds's System of Medicine_, vol. i., 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Zuelzer, _Ziemssen's Cyclopædia of Medicine_, vol. ii.,\r\n1875.]\r\n\r\nAs early as the ninth century several epidemics of catarrhal fever,\r\nItalian fever, and the like, which were probably influenza, were made\r\nmatter of history. In the year A.D. 827 a cough which spread like the\r\nplague was recorded. In 876 there appeared in Italy a similar\r\nepidemic, which spread with great rapidity over all Europe. It is\r\nrelated that dogs and birds suffered with symptoms not unlike those\r\ncharacterizing the affection in man. In 976, Germany and all France\r\nsuffered from a fever of which the chief {853} symptom was cough. No\r\nfurther epidemic is noted until two centuries later, when, in 1173, a\r\nwidespread malady, of which the symptoms were chiefly catarrhal, raged\r\nthroughout Europe; while less important epidemics of a like character\r\nare recorded as having occurred during the following century\r\n(1239-99).\r\n\r\nIn the medical writings of the fourteenth century there are to be\r\nfound records of six epidemics, and in the fifteenth seven great\r\nvisitations of influenza are described (Parkes).\r\n\r\nAitken[4] speaks of a very fatal prevalence of influenza throughout\r\nFrance in 1311, and of an epidemic in 1403 in which the mortality was\r\nso great that the courts of law in Paris were closed in consequence of\r\nthe deaths.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Aitken's _Practice of Medicine_, vol. i., 1872.]\r\n\r\nInfluenza is mentioned in the _Annals of the Four Masters_ as having\r\nprevailed in Ireland in the fourteenth century, and a disease\r\ncharacterized by similar symptoms is alluded to in early Gaelic\r\nmanuscripts under the name of Creatan (creat, the chest). The disease\r\nis described also in an Irish manuscript of the fifteenth century\r\nunder the terms Fuacht and Slaodan.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Theophilus Thompson, _Annals of Influenza_, 1852.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest epidemic that prevailed in the British Isles of which any\r\naccurate description remains is that of the year 1510. The disease\r\ncame from Malta, and invaded first Sicily, then Italy and Spain and\r\nPortugal, whence it crossed the Alps into Hungary and Germany as far\r\nas the Baltic Sea, extending westward into France and Britain. Its\r\ntrack widened over the whole of Europe from the south-east to the\r\nextreme north-west, and it is said that not a single family and scarce\r\na person escaped it. It was attended by a \"grievous pain in the head,\r\nheaviness, difficulty of breathing, hoarseness, loss of strength and\r\nappetite, restlessness, retchings from a terrible tearing cough.\r\nPresently succeeded a chilliness, and so violent a cough that many\r\nwere in danger of suffocation. The first day it was without spitting,\r\nbut about the seventh or eighth day much viscid phlegm was spit up.\r\nOthers (though fewer) spat only water and froth. When they began to\r\nspit, cough and shortness of breath were easier. None died except some\r\nchildren. In some it went off with a looseness, in others by sweating.\r\nBleeding and purging did hurt.\"[6] Blisters were commonly\r\nemployed--two each upon the arms and legs, and one to the back of the\r\nhead. The description is sufficiently clear to place the nature of\r\nthis epidemic beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Thomas Short, _A General Chronological History of the\r\nAir, Weather, Meteors, etc._, London, 1749; quoted in the _Annals of\r\nInfluenza_.]\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1557, starting westward from Asia, spread over Europe,\r\nand then crossed the Atlantic to America. The malady broke out in\r\nEngland, after a season of unusual rain and great scarcity of corn, in\r\nthe month of September. \"Presently after were many catarrhs, quickly\r\nfollowed by a more severe cough, pain of the side, difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and a fever. The pain was neither violent nor pricking, but\r\nmild. The third day they expectorated freely. The sixth, seventh, or\r\nat the farthest the eighth day, all who had that pain of the side\r\ndied, but such as were blooded on the first or second day recovered on\r\nthe fourth or fifth; but bleeding on the last two days did no\r\nservice.\" \"Some, but very few, had continual fevers along with it;\r\nmany had {854} double tertians; others simply slight intermittent. All\r\nwere worse by night than by day; such as recovered were long\r\nvaletudinary, had a weak stomach, and hypped.\" Gravid women either\r\naborted or died. This epidemic spread with frightful rapidity.\r\nThousands were attacked at the same time. The entire population of\r\nNismes, with scarcely an exception, fell ill of it upon the same day.\r\nIt was extremely fatal. In Mantua Carpentaria, a small town near\r\nMadrid, it broke out in August, and so fatal were the bloodletting and\r\npurging which constituted the treatment at first, that, of the two\r\nthousand persons who were bled, all died. The disease raged in some\r\nparts till the middle of the following year (1558), and carried off,\r\nin Delft alone, five thousand of the poor. In all cases mild treatment\r\nwas called for, with warm broths and speedy immersals, \"to recall the\r\nappetite and keep the vessels of the throat open.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1580 a great epidemic of influenza spread from the south-east\r\ntoward the north-west over Asia, Africa, and Europe. From\r\nConstantinople and Venice it overran Hungary and Germany, and reached\r\nthe farthest regions of Norway, Sweden, and Russia. It spread into\r\nEngland, and has been described by Dr. Short. In Italy it prevailed\r\nduring August and September, in England from the middle of August to\r\nthe end of September, and in Spain during the whole summer. In most\r\nplaces its duration was about six weeks. As a rule, the termination\r\nwas favorable, although the disease ran a somewhat protracted course.\r\nIn the account of Dr. Short it is stated that \"few died except those\r\nthat were let blood of or had unsound viscera.\" In some places, on the\r\ncontrary, the course of the disease was very severe. In Rome two\r\nthousand died of it, according to the author just cited, but Zuelzer\r\ninforms us that the victims of this epidemic in the Eternal City were\r\nnot less than nine thousand, and adds that Madrid must have been\r\nalmost depopulated by it. This high mortality has been attributed to\r\nthe bloodletting practised in the treatment of the disease. The\r\nsymptoms were similar to those of the previous epidemics, with a\r\ngreater shortness of breath, which continued in many cases for some\r\ntime after the disappearance of the catarrhal trouble. There was great\r\nsweating at the end of the attack. The plague, measles, and small-pox\r\nprevailed also, and with considerable violence, during the year 1580.\r\n\r\nInfluenza, unfelt for several years, reappeared in Germany in 1591; an\r\nepidemic extending from Holland through France and into Italy occurred\r\nin 1593. In 1610 catarrh is said to have prevailed throughout Europe.\r\nIn 1626-27 epidemic catarrhal fever made its appearance in Italy and\r\nFrance; in 1642-43 in Holland; in 1647 in Spain and in the colonies of\r\nthe Western World; and again, in 1655 in North America. According to\r\nWebster,[7] this epidemic of 1647 was the first catarrh mentioned in\r\nAmerican annals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Noah Webster, _A Brief History of Epidemic and\r\nPestilential Diseases_, London, 1800.]\r\n\r\nIn 1658 and 1675 it again visited Austria, Germany, England, etc. The\r\nfirst of these two epidemics is described by Willis,[8] and the second\r\nby Sydenham,[9] as they occurred in England, and the accounts are to\r\nbe {855} found in the _Annals of Influenza_. It is about this period\r\nthat the disease began to be known as influenza, and it is not without\r\ninterest to observe that the influence of the stars suggested itself,\r\nin connection with its sudden appearance and wide prevalence, to the\r\nminds of the physicians of this date. Willis writes that \"about the\r\nend of April (1658), suddenly a distemper arose, as if sent by some\r\nblast of the stars, which laid hold on very many together; that in\r\nsome towns in the space of a week above a thousand people fell sick\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Dr. Willis, _The Description of a Catarrhal Fever\r\nEpidemical in the Middle of the Spring in the Year 1658: Practice of\r\nPhysick_, 1684.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _The Epidemic Coughs of the Year 1675, with the Pleurisy\r\nand Peripneumony that supervened_: from the _Works_ of Thomas\r\nSydenham, M.D.]\r\n\r\nEpidemics are recorded as having occurred in Great Britain and Europe\r\nin 1688, 1693, and in 1709. The disease raged in 1712 widely over\r\nEurope from Denmark to Italy.\r\n\r\nIn 1729-30 a widespread epidemic swept over Europe. In five months it\r\nextended over Russia, Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. In Vienna\r\nsixty thousand persons fell ill of it. In the autumn it spread to\r\nEngland, and reached France and Switzerland; from there it extended to\r\nItaly, and by February it had reached Rome and Naples. Spain did not\r\nescape its ravages, and it is said to have found its way to Mexico.\r\nThe symptoms did not differ in any important respect from those\r\nalready described as characterizing previous epidemics. Pains in the\r\nlimbs and fever marked the onset of the attack; catarrh, oppression,\r\nhoarseness, cough followed. In some cases delirium, drowsiness, and\r\nfaintings occurred. A petechial eruption was observed, in some\r\ninstances, between the fourth and seventh days. This renders it\r\nprobable that typhus or cerebro-spinal fever prevailed at the same\r\ntime. Turbid urine, copious sweats, bilious stools, and nose-bleeding\r\nwere often noted. In Switzerland only children and old persons died.\r\nThe disease was not very fatal.\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1732-33) an epidemic, starting from Saxony and\r\nPoland, overran Germany, Switzerland, and Holland, and invaded Great\r\nBritain in the month of December. Toward the end of January it spread\r\nin a south-easterly direction to France, Italy, Spain, and westward to\r\nNorth America, thence southward to the islands of the West Indies, and\r\non to South America. The course of the disease in this epidemic was\r\nfavorable. The attack terminated in from three to fourteen days, with\r\nsweating, bleeding from the nose, or an abundant discharge from the\r\nnasal passages. The aged and those suffering from chronic pulmonary\r\ndiseases mostly perished. In Scotland three forms of the affection\r\nwere described--namely, the cephalic, the thoracic, and the abdominal.\r\nThe epidemic slowly spread over Eastern Europe and in a south-easterly\r\ndirection, and may be said to have lasted till 1737.\r\n\r\nConcerning this epidemic John Huxham of Plymouth wrote as follows:[10]\r\n\"About this time a disease invaded these parts which was the most\r\ncompletely epidemic of any I remember to have met with; not a house\r\nwas free from it; the beggar's hut and the nobleman's palace were\r\nalike subject to its attacks, scarce a person escaping either in town\r\nor country; old and young, strong and infirm, shared the same fate.\"\r\nThe malady had raged in Cornwall and the western parts of Devonshire\r\nfrom the beginning of February; it reached Plymouth on the 10th, which\r\nwas on a Saturday, and that day numbers were suddenly seized. The next\r\nday multitudes were taken ill, and by the 18th or 20th of March\r\nscarcely {856} any one had escaped it. \"The disorder began at first\r\nwith a slight shivering; this was presently followed by a transient\r\nerratic heat and headache and a violent and troublesome sneezing; then\r\nthe back and lungs were seized with flying pains, which sometimes\r\nattacked the heart likewise, and though they did not long remain\r\nthere, yet were very troublesome, being greatly irritated by the\r\nviolent cough which accompanied the disorder, in the fits of which a\r\ngreat quantity of a thin, sharp mucus was thrown out from the nose and\r\nmouth. These complaints were like those arising from what is called\r\ncatching cold, but presently a slight fever came on, which afterward\r\ngrew more violent; the pulse was now very quick, but not in the least\r\nhard and tense like that in a pleurisy; nor was the urine remarkably\r\nred, but very thick, and inclining to a whitish color; the tongue,\r\ninstead of being dry, was thickly covered with a whitish mucus or\r\nslime; there was an universal complaint of want of rest and a great\r\ngiddiness. Several likewise were seized with a most racking pain in\r\nthe head, often accompanied by a slight delirium. Many were troubled\r\nwith a tinnitus aurium, or singing in the ears; and numbers suffered\r\nfrom violent earaches or pains in the meatus auditorius, which in some\r\nturned to an abscess. Exulcerations and swellings of the fauces were\r\nlikwise very common. The sick were in general very much given to\r\nsweat, which, when it broke out of its own accord, was very plentiful\r\nand continued without striking in again, and did often in the space of\r\ntwo or three days wholly carry off the fever. You have here a\r\ndescription of this epidemic disease such as it prevailed hereabouts,\r\nattacking every one more or less; but still, considering the great\r\nmultitude that were seized by it, it was fatal to but few, and that\r\nchiefly infants and consumptive old people. It generally went off\r\nabout the fourth day, leaving behind a troublesome cough, which was\r\nvery often of long duration, and such a dejection of strength as one\r\nwould hardly have suspected from the shortness of the time.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, this disorder was rarely mortal, unless by some very\r\ngreat error arising in the treatment of it; however, this very\r\ncircumstance proved fatal to some, who, making too slight of it,\r\neither on account of its being so common or not thinking it very\r\ndangerous, often found asthmas, hectics, or even consumptions\r\nthemselves, the forfeitures of their inconsiderate rashness.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Observations on the Air and Epidemical Diseases,\r\ntranslated from the Latin_, London, 1758.]\r\n\r\nArbuthnot also described this visitation of the disease.[11] He\r\nregarded the uniformity of the symptoms in every place as most\r\nremarkable, and tells us that during the whole season in which it\r\nprevailed there was \"a great run of hysterical, hypochondriacal, and\r\nnervous distempers; in short, all the symptoms of relaxation.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _An Essay concerning the Effects of Air on Human\r\nBodies_, London, 1751.]\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1737-38 influenza again swept over England, North\r\nAmerica, the islands of the West Indies, and France; in 1742-43 it\r\nprevailed in Western Europe and the British Isles; in 1757-58 in North\r\nAmerica, the West Indies, France, and Scotland. In 1761 it overran the\r\nNorth American colonies and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1762 extended very generally over Europe and Great\r\nBritain. In Germany nine-tenths of the population were attacked by the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nWidely extended epidemics prevailed in Europe and America in 1767\r\n{857} and 1775; in 1772 it raged in North America; in 1778-80, in\r\nFrance, Germany and Russia. Noah Webster found influenza prevalent in\r\nNorth America in 1781; the next year one of the most remarkable\r\nepidemics of this disease (described as the epidemic of 1782) appeared\r\nin Europe. It came from the East, from Asia into Russia. From St.\r\nPetersburg it spread during the winter and spring over Sweden,\r\nGermany, Holland, and France. In the autumn it was in Italy, Spain,\r\nand Portugal. The crews of Dutch and English ships were taken ill with\r\nthe disease upon the high seas.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna three-fourths of the population fell ill of it with such\r\nsuddenness that it got here for the first time its name of \"Blitz\r\nKatarrh\" (lightning catarrh). It was characterized by great pain in\r\nthe back, breast, and throat, and by extraordinary enfeeblement.\r\nRelapses occurred, and inflammation of the lungs and bowels was\r\ncommon. Children remained relatively exempt from its seizure. This\r\nepidemic broke out in England about the end of April and raged until\r\nthe end of June. \"The duration of the malady in some was not above a\r\nday or two, but it usually lasted near a week or longer. In a few the\r\nsymptoms seemed to abate in two or three days, but some returned and\r\nraged with more violence than at first.\"[12] The disease was not\r\nregarded as in itself fatal, and few could be said to have died of it\r\n\"but those who were old, asthmatic, or who had been debilitated by\r\nsome previous indisposition.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _An Account of the Epidemic Disease called the Influenza\r\nof the Year 1782.

Read at the College,\r\nJune 25, 1783._]\r\n\r\nNumerous recurring outbreaks took place in Europe and America during\r\nthe years 1788-90. One of these, as it occurred in America, is well\r\ndescribed by Dr. John Warren[13] of Boston in a letter to Lettsom.\r\nThis letter is dated May 30, 1790, and among other matters of great\r\ninterest respecting the disease it is stated that \"Our beloved\r\nPresident Washington is but now on the recovery from a very severe and\r\ndangerous attack of it in that city\" (New York).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Memoirs of the Life and Writings of J. Coakley\r\nLettsom_, Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, 1817.]\r\n\r\nWebster mentions an epidemic in America in 1790, one in Europe in\r\n1795, and another in Europe in 1797, but there seems to have been no\r\ngeneral epidemic of sufficient importance to attract the attention of\r\nother writers upon the subject until 1798, when the malady again broke\r\nout in Russia and spread over the greater part of Europe, continuing\r\nto prevail in various regions till 1803, when it again appeared in\r\nEngland, and is described by several writers of that country.\r\n\r\nFrom 1805 to 1827 influenza prevailed (according to Zuelzer, who tells\r\nus that few years during this interval were free from it) in\r\nfrequently-recurring epidemics in Europe and America. Thompson\r\nmentions no visitation in England between 1803 and 1831.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1830 began a series of epidemics remarkable for their wide\r\ndiffusion and the rapid succession with which they followed one upon\r\nanother. The disease began in China; in September it reached the\r\nIndian Archipelago; it swept into Russia, and invaded Moscow in\r\nNovember; in January, 1831, it was raging in St. Petersburg; March\r\nfound it in Warsaw; April in Eastern Prussia and Silesia; in May it\r\nprevailed in Denmark, Finland, and a great part of Germany, and in\r\n{858} the same month it fell upon Paris; in June it affected England\r\nand Sweden; it was still creeping about Middle Europe and lingering in\r\nGreat Britain at the end of July; in the early winter it swept\r\nsouthward into Italy, and westward across the Atlantic to North\r\nAmerica, and was still harassing the inhabitants of certain regions of\r\nthe United States in January and February, 1832. Meanwhile it\r\ncontinued in the East, spreading to Java, Farther India, and the\r\nIndian Archipelago. It continued in Hindostan after it had died out in\r\nEurope. But in January, 1833, it again visited Russia, and rolled\r\nthence southward and eastward over the most of Europe. It is recorded\r\nthat by February it had reached Galicia and Eastern Prussia; in March\r\nit was in Prussia, Bohemia, and Warsaw, and had extended to Syria and\r\nEgypt; in April to many parts of Germany and Austria and to France and\r\nGreat Britain. Midsummer found the disease yet prevailing in some\r\ndistricts of Germany and Northern Italy, and in the early autumn it\r\nwas in Switzerland and Eastern France; in November it visited Naples.\r\n\r\nEpidemics so frequent, so widespread, and so unsparing of individuals\r\nwherever the disease appeared could not fail to excite a deep and\r\ngeneral interest. From this period the literature of the subject has\r\nbeen voluminous.\r\n\r\nA brief period of repose ensued. For three years no epidemic occurred\r\nwhich was of sufficient importance to attract the attention of medical\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1837, influenza reappeared, and first, as so often\r\nbefore, in Russia; Sweden and Denmark were almost simultaneously\r\naffected; in January, 1837, it broke out in London, and rapidly swept\r\nover all England and into France and Germany. In January it appeared\r\nin Berlin, and shortly afterward in Dresden, Munich, and Vienna. The\r\ndisease spread by February into Switzerland, and into Spain as far as\r\nMadrid by the end of March. In London almost the whole population was\r\nattacked, and the mortality was enormous. It is stated that the deaths\r\nwere quadrupled during the prevalence of the disease. Large\r\npopulations suffered most. This epidemic spread into the southern\r\nhemisphere, and prevailed at the same time, and consequently at\r\nexactly the opposite season that it prevailed north of the equator, in\r\nSydney and at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nFrom 1837 to 1850-51 numerous epidemics of influenza occurred. Few\r\nyears were exempt from them. The epidemic of 1847-48 has been\r\ndescribed by many writers, and more particularly, as it occurred in\r\nLondon, by Peacock[14] with great exactitude. It is estimated that\r\none-fourth of the entire population of that city were more or less\r\naffected by the disease. The epidemic prevailed in London for six\r\nmonths, and, although the deaths registered for the entire period as\r\nfrom influenza amounted to only 1739, it is stated in the report of\r\nthe registrar-general that during the six weeks the epidemic was at\r\nits height not less than five thousand persons died, in the\r\nmetropolitan districts, in excess of the average mortality of the\r\nperiod, the excess showing itself in nearly every class of disease,\r\nthe local maladies which had been the predominant affections being\r\ndoubtless in many cases assigned as the cause of death. This {859}\r\nepidemic affected between one-fourth and one-half of the population of\r\nParis, and in Geneva the proportion of those attacked was not less\r\nthan one-third of the entire population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _On the Influenza, or Epidemic Catarrhal Fever of\r\n1847-48_, Thomas Berill Peacock. M.D., 1848.]\r\n\r\nMore or less widespread epidemics of influenza are recorded as having\r\noccurred in 1857-58 and 1860; in 1864 in Switzerland; in 1867 in Paris\r\nin the spring; and at various times in the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nA mild epidemic occurred in 1874 in Berlin.\r\n\r\nInfluenza prevailed over a wide area in the United States during the\r\nearly months of 1879. The characteristics of this visitation have been\r\nwell described by Da Costa.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: \"The Prevailing Epidemic of Influenza--Its\r\nCharacteristic Phenomena--Pulmonary, Gastro-intestinal, Cerebral, and\r\nNervous--Its Wide Distribution, Mortality, and Treatment,\" _Medical\r\nand Surgical Reporter_, Philadelphia, March 8, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe disease, since the great epidemic of 1847-48, has affected a\r\nsmaller proportion of the inhabitants of the localities visited, and\r\nhas run a less dangerous course, than in the earlier epidemics. It has\r\nfor this reason occupied a less conspicuous place in the medical\r\nliterature of recent years. It is nevertheless true that even in the\r\nmildest epidemics, when a relatively small number of persons are\r\nseized and the symptoms are in most cases almost insignificant, cases\r\ndo here and there occur which are of a serious or even fatal\r\ncharacter, and that the death-rate from other diseases is for the time\r\nconsiderably increased.\r\n\r\nCatarrhal affections have often prevailed among the domestic animals\r\nwhen influenza has been epidemic. Horses, dogs, and cats are subject\r\nto these disorders; neat cattle, goats, and sheep have been less\r\ncommonly affected; chickens and pheasants have suffered, and it is\r\nstated by some of the older writers that birds, and particularly the\r\nsparrow, have deserted localities in which influenza was prevailing,\r\nand that migratory birds have taken flight earlier than usual.\r\n\r\nThese epizoötics have sometimes preceded the appearance of influenza\r\namong men by a period of some weeks or days; in other instances they\r\nhave appeared at the same time; and in a widespread outbreak among\r\nhorses in the United States in 1872, in which the symptoms and morbid\r\nanatomy, accurately observed, were undoubtedly those of influenza, the\r\ndisease did not affect man except to a very limited extent. A want of\r\nfulness of description, and the inaccuracy of diagnosis too common in\r\nthe consideration of the general diseases of the lower animals, leave\r\nthe precise nature of most of the epizoötics described by the earlier\r\nwriters doubtful.\r\n\r\nAn extensive influenza of moderate intensity prevailed as an\r\nepizoötic, chiefly affecting horses, during the latter part of the\r\nsummer and the autumn of 1880 in Canada and the United States east of\r\nthe Mississippi River. Dogs were also affected, but less generally,\r\nand human beings to a still slighter extent. In several localities\r\nwhere this invasion was observed by the writer the horses were first\r\naffected, the dogs next, and after the lapse of some weeks, as the\r\nanimals were recovering, the disease became epidemic; but those\r\npersons who took care of horses and were much in contact with them\r\nneither suffered earlier nor more severely than others not so exposed.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--1. Predisposing Influences.--There are no {860}\r\nwell-established facts pointing to the existence of individual\r\npeculiarities that can be regarded as predisposing influences. When\r\nthe disease appears a large proportion of the population is attacked\r\nwithout distinction of age, sex, social condition, or occupation.\r\nPrevious illness, whether acute or chronic, local or constitutional,\r\naffords no protection. Aged and infirm persons and those of nervous\r\ntemperament are peculiarly liable to attack, but the robust possess no\r\nimmunity. All races and dwellers in every climate are the victims of\r\ninfluenza. In a community invaded by the disease females are apt to be\r\nthe first attacked, adult males next, and children last. It has been\r\nobserved that in some epidemics children are but little liable to\r\ncontract the disease.\r\n\r\nAn attack confers no exemption from the disease in another epidemic,\r\nand independently of relapses, which are not infrequent, persons have\r\nbeen known to experience a second attack during the prevalence of the\r\nsame epidemic.\r\n\r\nPersons dwelling in overcrowded and ill-ventilated habitations and in\r\nlow, damp and unhealthy situations have, in certain epidemics,\r\nespecially suffered, and the increase of deaths by influenza is\r\nproportionately much greater in districts in which there is ordinarily\r\na high mortality than in healthier places.\r\n\r\nInfluenza appears at all seasons of the year and affects the\r\ninhabitants of every latitude. It has no connection with known\r\natmospheric conditions. Many of the earlier writers sought to\r\nestablish a relation between low temperatures and sudden variations of\r\ntemperature and influenza, and by reason of the confusion among the\r\npeople between these diseases and common \"colds\" there has always\r\nexisted an opinion that such a relation obtains. There is, however, no\r\nevidence to sustain this view; neither low temperature nor abrupt\r\nchanges give rise to the affection. It has prevailed in hot and dry\r\nseasons, in the West Indies, on the coast of Java, in India, in Egypt,\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, on the Riviera in summer.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the air as regards moisture, or dryness, does not\r\ninfluence the spread of the disease. It has occurred at sea, on low\r\nsea-coasts, and in the dryest climates, as, for example, in Upper\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nIts spread is not much influenced by local winds. It does not travel\r\nwith the same velocity, and even sometimes advances against them. In\r\nseveral well-authenticated instances a dense and foul fog has preceded\r\nand attended the local outbreak of epidemics. The much greater number\r\nof epidemics that have occurred altogether without such manifestations\r\nmake it in a high degree probable that this has been a coincidence.\r\nOzone in large quantities artificially produced may give rise to the\r\nsymptoms of ordinary catarrh, but it is not a cause of influenza. The\r\ndisease is not in any way connected with the condition of the soil,\r\nelevation, volcanic eruption, or any other local cause. The history of\r\nevery epidemic may be adduced in proof of this statement.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the consideration of the exciting causes of\r\ninfluenza, it is important to review the known facts concerning the\r\nmarch of epidemics and the spread of the disease in affected\r\nlocalities. It has prevailed with greater or less frequency in almost\r\nevery region of the globe. Epidemics recur at irregular periods. It\r\nwas at one time supposed that the course of the disease was cyclical,\r\nwith a return at intervals of about one hundred years. This view was\r\nlong ago proved to be unfounded. About every {861} twenty-five or\r\nthirty-five years great epidemics have swept over vast areas of the\r\nglobe, and influenza may be said to be, at such times, pandemic.\r\nLess-widely extended epidemics have taken place with greater or less\r\nfrequency in the intervals between the great outbreaks. But it is not\r\npossible to establish anything like a regular periodicity in the\r\nreturns of the disease.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed in some instances to prevail within restricted\r\nlocalities, as, for example, in a single city. Such local epidemics\r\nare without doubt due to local causes, and are of the nature of simple\r\nordinary catarrhal fever, rather than true influenza.\r\n\r\nThe epidemics have extended over great areas, usually in a direction\r\nfrom the east or north-east toward the west and south. At other times\r\nthey take the opposite course, and in some years they have appeared to\r\nradiate in various directions from several centres. It is in\r\nconsequence of these facts that two views have arisen concerning the\r\norigin of the affection. The first of these is, that each epidemic\r\nstarts out from some single unknown source, and spreads thence from\r\npoint to point, invading more distant localities successfully as it\r\nadvances, until at length it dies out in regions remote from the\r\nstarting-point. This opinion is in accord with the popular belief.\r\nThus, the Italians have called it the German disease; the Germans, the\r\nRussian pest; the Russians, the Chinese catarrh. The geographical\r\nrelation of these nations indicates the usual track of the great\r\nepidemics, as shown in the foregoing historical sketch. The other\r\nopinion is, that it arises not from some single particular place, but\r\nthat it may start anywhere, and that widespread epidemics are due to\r\nthe successive outbreaks of the disease at many distinct points of\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that the great epidemics of influenza are due to some\r\ngeneral and pandemic influence is conclusive. The point of origin of\r\nthe great epidemics has not yet been indicated with precision, and\r\nmust remain beyond conjecture until further facts bearing upon the\r\nquestion of their source are brought to light. When it has prevailed\r\nover a large portion of the earth's surface its progress from place to\r\nplace has usually been rapid. In this respect, however, the epidemics\r\nshow a great diversity. It sometimes travels exceedingly slowly. It is\r\nsaid to have overrun Europe in six weeks, and it has again taken six\r\nmonths to do so. It sometimes attacks places widely remote from each\r\nother within short intervals of time, and it has appeared at the same\r\ntime in different quarters of the globe. It does not follow the great\r\nlines of travel and commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nWhen influenza enters a city it continues to prevail, as a rule, from\r\nfour weeks to two months, but exceptionally it remains a longer time;\r\nfor example, the epidemic of 1831 was prevalent in Paris for the\r\ngreater part of the year. It in all instances finally disappears, and\r\nsporadic cases do not occur in the intervals between the epidemics.\r\n\r\nIn rare instances the epidemics are heralded by scattered cases. But\r\nas a rule this disease attacks simultaneously great numbers of the\r\ninhabitants of affected districts, so that, when the epidemic is\r\nsevere, the sick are in a short time to be counted by thousands and\r\nbusiness is paralyzed as by a blow. Epidemics rapidly reach their\r\nheight, and subside almost as suddenly as they began. In a large city\r\nthe disease frequently, perhaps always, makes its appearance nearly at\r\nthe same time in several {862} different localities, affecting certain\r\nstreets and quarters solely or more generally than others for a time,\r\nand spreading thus from several centres through the entire community.\r\nLarge towns and cities are generally affected earlier than the\r\nvillages around them, and the latter, though closely adjacent,\r\nsometimes escape for weeks. The crews of ships upon the high seas, not\r\nsailing from an infected port, are said to have suffered from the\r\nseizure, and epidemics have many times crossed the Atlantic from the\r\nOld World to the New, and more than once in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n2. The Exciting Cause.--Large as has been the place in medical\r\nliterature occupied by the histories of epidemics of influenza, the\r\nnature of the \"epidemic influence\" which gives rise to the disease is\r\nstill unknown.\r\n\r\nThe question of the contagiousness of influenza is one of grave\r\ninterest, and has been the subject of much controversy. The great\r\nrapidity of the spread of epidemics, the vast area they overrun, the\r\nfact that they do not follow the lines of human intercourse, the\r\nsuddenness with which great numbers of the inhabitants of an invaded\r\ndistrict or city are seized, the fact that the most complete seclusion\r\nfrom intercourse with affected persons, or even the shutting up of\r\nhouses, affords in most instances no protection whatever,--all go to\r\nshow that the disease spreads, in the main, independently of direct\r\ncontact. This opinion has been almost universally entertained. There\r\nis evidence, however, to show that the disease is to some extent\r\ncontagious; and so convincing have the facts bearing upon this point\r\nappeared to some that they have believed it to be propagated entirely\r\nby human intercourse. Haygarth[16] declares, as the result of his\r\nobservations during the epidemics of 1775 and 1782, that the influenza\r\nspreads \"by the contagion of patients in the distemper;\" and\r\nFalconer,[17] writing of the epidemic of 1803, says, \"I have no doubt\r\nthat it is contagious in the strictest sense of the word.\" Watson[18]\r\nregards the instances in which the complaint has first broken out in\r\nthose particular houses of a town at which travellers have arrived\r\nfrom infected places as too numerous to be attributed to mere chance.\r\nVery often those dwelling near the invalids are attacked next in the\r\norder of time, and when the disease affects a household all do not\r\nusually manifest the symptoms at the same time, but one member after\r\nanother is stricken down with it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: John Haygarth, M.D., F.R.S., _On the Manner in which the\r\nInfluenza of 1775 and 1782 spread by Contagion in Chester and its\r\nNeighborhood._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: William Falconer, M.D., F.R.S., _An Account of the\r\nEpidemic Catarrhal Fever, commonly called the Influenza, as it\r\nappeared at Bath in the Winter and Spring of the Year 1803_, Bath,\r\n1803.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Principles and Practice of Medicine_.]\r\n\r\nIn a few rare cases the isolation or seclusion of a community has\r\nappeared to give protection, as in cloisters, prisons, garrisons, and\r\nthe like; at all events, there are instances on record where\r\nsegregated communities of this kind have escaped attack.\r\n\r\nThe following observation, conducted under unusual circumstances,\r\nestablishes the fact that influenza may be brought from an infected\r\ncity in such a way as to give rise to a localized outbreak in a remote\r\ncommunity. Drs. Guitéras and White[19] narrate that, influenza\r\nprevailing in Europe, and particularly in Paris and London, an\r\nAmerican gentleman in bad health contracted the disease in London,\r\nimproved, suffered a relapse {863} shortly afterward in Paris, and\r\ndied there at the end of December, 1879. His body was embalmed and\r\nsent home. Following the exposure of the remains of this person to the\r\nview of his family in Philadelphia there was an outbreak of influenza\r\nwith characteristic symptoms, which affected, in the first place,\r\nmembers of that family; afterward, friends living in close intercourse\r\nwith them; next, the medical attendant of some of them; and finally,\r\nthe housekeeper and a patient or two of one of the physicians who\r\nwrote the paper, the whole number affected in Philadelphia being\r\neighteen at the time of the publication of the account. Subsequently\r\ntwo or three other cases were developed, but the disease did not\r\nextend beyond the immediate circle of those in direct communication\r\nwith the invalids.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: John Guitéras, M.D., and J. W. White, M.D., \"A\r\nContribution to the History of Influenza, being a Study of a Series of\r\nCases,\" _Philadelphia Medical Times_, April 10, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIt was at one time thought that influenza developed at once, without a\r\nperiod of incubation, persons in perfect health being struck down with\r\nit as by lightning-stroke. It is, however, now known that a period of\r\nincubation, varying from a few hours to several days, and usually\r\nwithout subjective symptoms, exists. Many instances are recorded in\r\nwhich persons coming into an infected city have remained well for one,\r\ntwo, or three days, but have eventually shared the sufferings of those\r\ninto whose midst they have come. There are cases also in which the\r\nperiod of incubation could not have been less than two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nThere is no sufficient evidence of a causal relation between influenza\r\nand any other epidemic disease. The statement that other prevalent\r\ndiseases abate in frequency and intensity upon its outbreak is not\r\nsustained by well-observed facts. Graves[20] holds that those\r\nsuffering with acute diseases are less liable during the febrile\r\nstage, but that they are attacked as convalescence sets in.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Clinical Medicine_.]\r\n\r\nThe facts in reference to the spread of epidemics of influenza and the\r\ncourse of the disease in infected localities are comprehensible upon\r\nno other theory than that of a specific infecting principle as its\r\nexciting cause. What this principle may be is not yet known; where it\r\noriginates is equally unknown; and our knowledge of the influences\r\nthat from time to time call it into activity and send it forth in\r\ndefinite directions over the earth is no less negative.\r\n\r\nSo general a disease can only be disseminated by the most general\r\nmedium, the atmosphere, and its exciting cause must be capable of\r\nreproducing itself in that medium, otherwise it would be lost by\r\ndispersion in traversing distances measured by the boundaries of\r\ncontinents and oceans. The rapid diffusion of influenza, sweeping over\r\ncontinents in a few weeks at one time, its slow migration, creeping\r\nabout a city and its environs for months, at another, are to be most\r\neasily explained upon the theory of a living miasm capable of being\r\ntransmitted by the air, and possessing at the same time an independent\r\nexistence. Such an entity would find certain localities more favorable\r\nto its growth, reproduction, and prolonged existence than others. From\r\nthis point of view influenza is a miasmatic disease. The infecting\r\nprinciple of this disease is also, to a slight extent, capable of\r\nbeing reproduced in or about the human body and transmitted by\r\npersonal intercourse, as well as conveyed from place to place by the\r\npersons or clothing of those affected or those travelling from\r\nlocalities in which the disease prevails. We are thus led to the\r\nconclusion that it is also contagious, though feebly so.\r\n\r\n{864} CLINICAL HISTORY.--Influenza, in individual cases, presents the\r\ngreatest variation as regards intensity, from the most trifling\r\nindisposition to an illness of the gravest kind, terminating in death.\r\nThese variations are dependent upon--1st, the previous health of the\r\nindividual, his age, and the power of resisting depressing influences\r\nwhich he possesses; 2d, the energy and the amount of the specific\r\ncause of the disease to which he has been exposed--in other words, the\r\ndose of the fever-producing poison; and 3d, the character of the\r\nprevailing epidemic.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that cases of very great severity are\r\noccasionally encountered during the prevalence of mild epidemics. In\r\nevery epidemic, on the contrary, a considerable part of the community\r\nsuffers from influenza in the mildest, or what has been called the\r\nrudimentary, form. This is characterized by general malaise, an easily\r\noncoming weariness upon bodily and mental effort, a disinclination for\r\nbusiness, some inability to fix the attention, and slight mental\r\nconfusion; to these nervous disturbances are added catarrhal symptoms,\r\nas coryza, sore throat, a tickling cough, and the like; but the\r\nindisposition is subfebrile--it does not amount to a fully-developed\r\nfever. Other cases present the symptoms of an ordinary attack of acute\r\ncoryza, laryngitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis, with unusual\r\nconstitutional disturbance, distressing headache, and pains in the\r\nback and limbs. The fever in this class of cases does not range high,\r\nyet the patients are ill enough to betake themselves to bed.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases the onset is usually abrupt. The attack begins with\r\nshivering or a chill, or with fits of chilliness alternating with\r\nheat. Fever is rapidly established. It is usually moderate; sometimes\r\nit reaches a high grade. It shows a tendency to morning remissions.\r\nSensations of chilliness occur; they are called forth by slight\r\nchanges in the external temperature. They are often followed by\r\nflushes of heat, and are, in many cases, attended by annoying sweats.\r\nThe febrile outbreak is sometimes preceded by intense frontal\r\nheadache, with pain in the orbits and at the root of the nose. In\r\nother cases these pains quickly follow the chill. Sneezing, redness of\r\nthe eyes and edges of the nostrils, a more or less abundant thin\r\ndischarge from the nose, and lachrymation, now occur. In some\r\ninstances there is bleeding from the nose. The throat becomes sore;\r\nthere is a tickling sensation in the upper air-passages; a dry cough\r\nsets in, attended by more or less hoarseness and shortness of breath.\r\nThe cough is paroxysmal, hard, distressing. It sometimes causes\r\nvomiting, like that which occurs in the paroxysms of whooping cough.\r\nChest-pains, stitches in the side, frequent sneezing, loss of the\r\nsense of smell and of taste, attend the development of the general\r\ncatarrhal manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe fever is attended by great depression, pains in the limbs, loss of\r\nappetite, thirst, constipation, and diminished secretion of urine. The\r\npulse is full, but, as a rule, only moderately increased in frequency.\r\nThere is in many cases slight, or even decided, blueness of the lips\r\nand finger-tips. The patient is distressed by restlessness and want of\r\nsleep. At the end of four or five days the febrile symptoms decline,\r\nat times gradually, oftener rapidly, with copious sweats or\r\nspontaneous flux from the bowels. The fever continues, however, when\r\nsevere complications have taken place, ten or twelve days. The\r\ndefervescence is marked by {865} an increased flow of sedimentary\r\nurine and considerable amelioration of the subjective symptoms. The\r\ncatarrhal symptoms outlast the fever two or three days, but cough and\r\nexpectoration may not disappear for some time.\r\n\r\nWith these symptoms are associated the evidences of functional\r\ndisturbance of the nervous system. There is remarkable nervous\r\ndepression; loss of strength and lowness of spirits are combined with\r\nmental weakness, or even stupor and delirium. In some cases slight\r\nconvulsions take place. Cutaneous hyperæsthesia occasionally occurs,\r\nand areas of burning pain in the skin are to be met with. Neuralgia,\r\nmuscle-pain, and aching referred to the bones are very common and\r\noften severe.\r\n\r\nIn other cases abdominal symptoms are prominent, while those referable\r\nto the head and chest are less urgent. The disease assumes the guise\r\nof a more or less severe catarrh of the gastro-enteric mucous\r\nmembrane, with disturbance of the functions of the liver. The fever\r\nand the peculiar nervous depression are, however, the same. Cases\r\nlikewise present themselves in which but little of the usual tendency\r\nto localization of the catarrhal processes is to be observed; there is\r\nfever of varying intensity, with great depression, and simultaneous\r\nand equal implication of the head and the organs of the chest and\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\nMany writers have sought to arrange the foregoing different forms of\r\ninfluenza in definite categories. It would be a useless task to\r\nreproduce their views upon the subject, or even to enumerate the\r\nvarieties that have been described. In practice, the various described\r\ntypes merge so gradually into each other, and are so modified by the\r\nindividual peculiarities of the sick, and by the complications which\r\narise in the course of the attack in consequence of such peculiarities\r\nor of previously existing diseases or tendencies to special forms of\r\ndisease, that, in point of fact, particular cases cannot usually be\r\nreferred to theoretical categories. Hysterical persons and those of a\r\nnervous constitution are prone to suffer especially from the peculiar\r\nnervous symptoms of influenza. The disease is also modified by the age\r\nof the subject of the attack; children manifest in a high degree the\r\nsigns of cerebral congestion, while old persons are subject in a\r\npeculiar manner to dangerous pulmonary complications, and those of a\r\ngouty or rheumatic constitution suffer more than others from muscular\r\npains.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the mildest form of influenza is from two to three\r\ndays; in well-developed cases without complications convalescence sets\r\nin between the fourth and tenth days; while severe cases with\r\ncomplications last much longer, several weeks often elapsing before\r\nrecovery is complete.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--ANALYSIS OF THE SYMPTOMS.--For the purpose of\r\nseparate consideration it is convenient to take up the symptoms\r\nbelonging to the fever first, then those of the special catarrh, and\r\nfinally those more particularly referable to the nervous system; but\r\nwe encounter in the present state of our knowledge of the pathology of\r\ninfluenza--or our ignorance of its pathology--no little difficulty in\r\ndeciding under which of these headings particular symptoms are\r\nproperly to be classed, by reason of the close interdependence of the\r\nchief processes of the disease and the anomalies of its phenomena\r\nviewed as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Fever.--The fever is of the sub-continuous or remittent type,\r\n{866} but its range is very irregular. Irregularity of temperature is\r\ncharacteristic of influenza and may assume diagnostic importance.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the fever is variable. As a rule, it is moderate or\r\nslight; occasionally it is severe. I observed in several cases during\r\nthe epidemic of 1879 in Philadelphia an evening temperature of only\r\n39° C. (102.2° F.). Da Costa in the same outbreak found the febrile\r\nmovement not high; the highest temperature he observed was 40° C.\r\n(104° F.). Biermer found a temperature of over 39° C. in moderate\r\ncases of catarrhal fever, and does not doubt that under certain\r\ntransient conditions the temperature may reach the height of that of\r\npneumonia or typhus. In weakly persons and the aged the fever is\r\nadynamic.\r\n\r\nThe pulse has no constant characters. Its frequency is moderately\r\nincreased; it is apt to be less forcible than in health, is generally\r\ncompressible, sometimes full, often irregular, changing in character\r\nin the course of a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe urine is usually diminished; sometimes its secretion is\r\ntemporarily suppressed; as a rule, it shows little change, and is\r\nrarely, as in other fevers, concentrated and high-colored. It deposits\r\non cooling a sediment of urates, which toward the close of the fever\r\nis often very abundant. The defervescence is in many instances\r\nattended by a copious secretion of urine. Albumen is not present\r\nexcept as a result of some complication.\r\n\r\nAt first the skin is hot and dry; later, frequent sweats occur;\r\nsweating generally attends the febrile remissions and the\r\ndefervescence not rarely sets in with copious, acid, ill-smelling\r\nsweats. In some cases a tendency to sweat shows itself early and\r\ncontinuous throughout the attack. Sudamina occur in great numbers.\r\n\r\nThe face is often flushed, and irregular mottlings of the skin,\r\nespecially upon the neck and chest, have been frequent in some of the\r\nepidemics. An outbreak of herpes about the lips is occasionally seen.\r\n\r\nDisturbances of the digestive tract are more or less prominent in\r\nalmost all cases. Only in a rudimentary and sub-febrile form are they\r\nabsent. In many cases they are such as are usually seen in febrile\r\ndisorders--namely, loss of appetite, thirst, impaired taste, pasty\r\ntongue, tenderness in the epigastrium, and constipation. Nausea and\r\nvomiting sometimes usher in the attack. In other cases (the so-called\r\nabdominal form) all the above symptoms are more severe, and diarrhoea,\r\ncolicky pains, and vomiting are superadded. In certain epidemics the\r\nintestinal catarrh has shown a tendency to run into dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the countenance is changed, in part by the\r\nappearance characterizing an ordinary attack of coryza of considerable\r\nor great severity, and in part by anxiety and depression. It is pale.\r\nWhere the pulmonary catarrh is excessive and dyspnoea great the lips\r\nbecome bluish. The facies sometimes suggests that of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThe Catarrh.--A more or less extensive hyperæmia of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the respiratory tract is invariably present, and may be\r\nsaid to characterize the disease.\r\n\r\nThere is cold in the head, more severe in most cases than ordinary\r\nsimple coryza. The eyelids are swollen and reddened, there is\r\nlachrymation, sneezing is frequent, and the discharge from the nose is\r\nabundant. Epistaxis is not rare. Sore throat, with tickling sensations\r\nand difficulty {867} in swallowing, is due to inflammation of the\r\npharynx and neighboring parts. In many instances the catarrhal\r\nsymptoms are due to a pharyngitis and tonsillitis only, the lower\r\nair-passages escaping. Hoarseness is common.\r\n\r\nCough is a prominent symptom. It is apt to be frequent and\r\ndistressing--sometimes paroxysmal from the beginning of the sickness,\r\nalmost always so at some period of its course. Its spasmodic character\r\nin some of the older epidemics led to the confounding of epidemic\r\ncatarrhal fever with whooping cough. It is apt to be worse toward\r\nevening and at night, but the sick are often tormented day and night\r\nby the loud racking cough. It often leads to vomiting, and by its\r\nviolence and persistence gives rise to pain and soreness in the\r\nmuscles of respiration (myalgia), and occasionally to hernia. It is at\r\nfirst dry or attended with a scanty muco-serous expectoration; later\r\non the sputa become opaque and muco-purulent, and in consumptive or\r\nfull-blooded persons or those having mitral disease they are sometimes\r\nstreaked or mingled with blood. Toward the close of the attack the\r\ncough becomes less urgent and loses its spasmodic character. In some\r\nepidemics cough is not a prominent symptom, and a few cases are\r\nencountered in most epidemics in which well-developed influenza runs\r\nits course without unusual, peculiar, or excessive cough. If the cough\r\nbe due to bronchitis, we find on auscultation the physical signs of\r\nthat affection. They are of course wanting when it is due simply to\r\nlaryngo-tracheal irritation. Hence we frequently detect sonorous and\r\nsibillant or mucous and subcrepitant râles upon both sides of the\r\nchest in the course of the attack, as in non-epidemic acute\r\nbronchitis; and, on the other hand, cases occur where the auscultatory\r\nsigns are but little or not at all altered from those of health. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to add that there are no special physical signs\r\nthat can be regarded as diagnostic of influenza.\r\n\r\nMany patients suffer from dyspnoea. Although due in some instances to\r\ncomplications, it occurs with remarkable frequency in those in whom\r\nnone of the objective signs of any pulmonary lesion can be discovered.\r\nIt is here of nervous origin. Graves assumes a direct disturbance in\r\nthe function of the vagus as its cause. This view is sustained by the\r\nobservation that the dyspnoea is now and then intermittent, or shows\r\nrhythmically recurring remissions, which are unattended by alteration\r\nof the physical signs. To Biermer it appears more probable that the\r\ncongestions so common in influenza, not attended by marked physical\r\nsigns until they lead to oedema, are to be regarded as the cause of\r\nthe dyspnoea. It varies greatly in intensity. In many patients it goes\r\non to marked oppression, great shortness of breath, precordial pain,\r\nand the like. In certain epidemics orthopnoea and suffocative attacks\r\nwere very common. Stitches in the side and pain under the sternum are\r\nobserved without appreciable physical signs.\r\n\r\nSymptoms Referable to the Nervous System.--Great prostration of\r\nmuscular strength is a very early symptom, and constitutes, in most\r\nepidemics, one of the remarkable features of the disease. Patients\r\nfrom the onset feel extremely weak, and are exhausted by the slightest\r\nbodily effort. The ordinary strength is not regained until\r\nconvalescence is far advanced.\r\n\r\nHeadache is a constant symptom. Severe frontal pains are scarcely\r\n{868} ever absent. They extend across the brow and deeply about the\r\norbits and at the root of the nose, having their seat in the\r\nSchneiderian mucous membrane and its prolongations lining the frontal\r\nsinuses and the nasal ducts. Sometimes the pain is referred also to\r\nthe region of the antrum of Highmore and to the Eustachian tube and\r\nthe middle ear. It occasionally extends over the whole head. Cutaneous\r\nhyperæsthesia of the head and neck and stiffness of the neck-muscles\r\nare also met with. The headache is often most intense; it lasts\r\ncommonly till the end of the attack, and may even outlast it. It\r\nincreases in severity with the fever and mental agitation toward\r\nevening. The occurrence of epistaxis affords some relief.\r\n\r\nAmong the more constant symptoms of influenza are very severe pains in\r\nthe limbs. Patients experience sensations of soreness and bruising,\r\nsuch as follow the most severe and unaccustomed muscular effort. Dull,\r\ntearing, and burning pains are felt sometimes in particular muscles or\r\ntendons; sometimes they are diffused over the whole body. Distressing\r\npains of a dragging or boring character in the loins and calves of the\r\nlegs are complained of. These pains are neither relieved nor\r\naggravated by gentle movement or by moderate pressure. A sense of\r\ncontraction of the chest and precordial distress also occurs, and\r\nstitches in the side (pleurodynia), substernal pain, and pains in the\r\nthroat and nape of the neck are common. When the attack is severe the\r\npatient is usually restless, sleepless, and anxious. Dizziness and a\r\ntendency to faint occur on rising, particularly in women. Mild\r\ndelirium is not uncommon, but the more intense forms are occasionally\r\nobserved. Active delirium was thought to be a mortal symptom in some\r\nof the older epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe inability to sleep bears no direct relation to the intensity of\r\nthe fever. It is seen in some cases where fever is slight or even\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nSomnolent states also occur. Great hebetude and torpor have marked\r\nsome epidemics. That of 1712 was called the sleepy sickness, by reason\r\nof the prevalence of these symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn grave cases painful muscle-cramps, subsultus tendinum, twitchings\r\nof particular muscles, and tremblings of the hands occur.\r\n\r\nThe mental power is enfeebled, and the acuteness of the special senses\r\nis diminished.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELS.--The most important complications of\r\ninfluenza are inflammatory diseases of the lungs. The hyperæmia and\r\nintense bronchitis already described as occurring in the severer cases\r\ncannot properly be looked upon as complications. They constitute\r\nrather essential processes of particular forms of the disease. But\r\ncapillary bronchitis, catarrhal pneumonia, and less frequently\r\ncroupous pneumonia, arise as complications in the course of the\r\ndisease. Satisfactory statistics are wanting, but Biermer estimates\r\nthat from 5 to 10 per cent. of the whole number of patients suffer\r\nfrom inflammatory lung-complications, and holds that the bloodletting\r\nso frequently practised by the older physicians was due to a desire to\r\ncombat inflammation. The comparative frequency of chest complications\r\nin different epidemics varies greatly, but the estimate of Biermer may\r\nbe accepted as an approximate average.\r\n\r\nOwing to the masking of the physical signs in the early stages and the\r\npre-existing pulmonary oedema, it is not always easy to recognize at\r\nonce {869} the occurrence of capillary bronchitis. This complication\r\nis attended with increasing dyspnoea, decided lividity of the face and\r\nextremities, and great prostration. Crepitant and subcrepitant râles\r\nat the lower portions of the posterior dorsal regions, rapidly\r\nspreading to all parts of the chest, without dulness at first and with\r\nincreased resonance later, instead of the signs of consolidation which\r\nare met with in pneumonia, are the signs which attend its appearance.\r\n\r\nCatarrhal pneumonia occurs insidiously, with gradual intensification\r\nof the bronchitic symptoms about the fourth or fifth day, but it may\r\nset in as early as the second day, or much later, during\r\nconvalescence. It is, as a rule, developed without chill or great\r\nincrease in the fever.\r\n\r\nOld persons and those of feeble constitutions are most liable to the\r\nforegoing complications.\r\n\r\nLobar pneumonia is less common. It is a late complication, occurring\r\ntoward the close of the attack or even when the patient is beginning\r\nto get about. It is easily recognized, and differs in no wise from\r\nacute lobar pneumonia occurring under other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1880, influenza being prevalent in Philadelphia, both\r\nepizoötic and epidemic, but very mild both among horses and men, I\r\nattended a medical student who, having had what he regarded as a cold\r\nfor about a week, had kept at his work without treatment, until, upon\r\nthe occurrence of a chill followed by grave thoracic symptoms, he was\r\nobliged to betake himself to bed. I first saw him the following day in\r\nthe hospital of the Jefferson College. There were the symptoms of\r\nacute lobar pneumonia, with the signs of extensive consolidation of\r\nthe left lung and pleurisy of the right side. Moreover, there were\r\ndelirium and jaundice. The urine was non-albuminous. The next evening\r\nhe died. At the same time many members of the class suffered from\r\ninfluenza, and a careful inquiry into the history of the case of this\r\nyoung gentleman satisfied me that the pneumonia had arisen as a\r\ncomplication in a neglected and moderate severe catarrhal fever. Until\r\nthe eighth day before his death he was in excellent health. No\r\nexamination of the body was permitted.\r\n\r\nGraves[21] thought that a kind of paralysis of the lungs, with great\r\noedema, takes place in some cases, and attributed it to an affection\r\nof the vagus. It was his conviction \"that the poison which produced\r\ninfluenza acted on the nervous system in general, and on the pulmonary\r\nnerves in particular, in such a way as to produce symptoms of\r\nbronchial irritation and dyspnoea, to which bronchial congestion and\r\ninflammation were often superadded.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Annals of Influenza_.]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that localized collapse of the lung often occurs. White\r\nand Guitéras attributed the consolidations of the lung to congestive\r\ncollapse due to enlargement of the tracheal and bronchial glands and\r\n\"disturbance of the great nervous tract about the root of the lung.\"\r\nThey were enabled to satisfy themselves of the existence of glandular\r\nenlargement--adenopathie bronchique--in nine of their eighteen cases\r\nby percussion practised in the method of M. Geneau de Mussy,[22] who\r\nwas the first to call attention to the importance of percussing the\r\nspinous processes of the vertebræ over the course of the trachea.\r\nFollowing this line in the healthy subject, a distinct tubular\r\n(high-pitched and slightly {870} tympanitic) sound is elicited by\r\npercussion down to the point of bifurcation of the trachea on the\r\nlevel of the fourth dorsal vertebra. Opposite the fifth and downward\r\nwe get the lower-pitched pulmonary resonance. When the tracheal and\r\nbronchial glands are enlarged, the tubular sound over the upper dorsal\r\nvertebræ is replaced by dulness, which may contrast sharply, above\r\nwith the tracheal, and below with the vesicular resonance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Chirurgie médicale_, Paris, 1874.]\r\n\r\nSome well-recognized peculiarities of the so-called pneumonias of\r\ninfluenza give weight to the view that the consolidations are not, in\r\nthe beginning, pneumonic at all. Thus, we have at first weakness of\r\nthe vesicular murmur, then its absence; the respiration soon becomes\r\nbronchial, without being preceded by dulness or the crepitant râle;\r\nthe extension of those consolidations from one part of the lung to\r\nanother is very irregular; the process is more apt to involve both\r\nsides than one; the disappearance of the consolidation is frequently\r\nvery rapid.\r\n\r\nThe relations of cause and effect between collapse and catarrhal\r\npneumonia are so close that it is not difficult to see how the\r\ncondition spoken of may lead to secondary lobular or catarrhal\r\npneumonia. In truth, this is a frequent result of collapse from any\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nWhite and Guitéras do not adduce any post-mortem facts in support of\r\ntheir theory. Peacock, however, observed in the epidemic of 1847\r\nsoftening and enlargement of the bronchial glands in several cases,\r\nand in one instance where there was no antecedent disease of the\r\nlungs, and where the physical signs corresponded to some extent with\r\nthose of the cases upon which White and Guitéras base their views.\r\n\r\nGangrene of the lungs must be named as one of the less common\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nThese complications are the chief cause of the danger of influenza in\r\nthe aged, the debilitated, and those suffering from previous disease\r\nof the thoracic organs.\r\n\r\nPleurisy is rare except where there is coexisting inflammation of the\r\nlungs. It may be associated with pericarditis. In old persons serous\r\neffusions into the pleural sac are now and then encountered.\r\n\r\nTroublesome laryngitis and chronic bronchitis may follow the attack.\r\nIn consequence of the extension of the catarrhal processes along the\r\nEustachian tube an actual inflammation of the middle ear is, in rare\r\ninstances, set up. Parotitis with salivation sometimes occurs,\r\nlikewise aphthous inflammations of the mouth.\r\n\r\nHerpes labialis occasionally occurs toward the end of the attack; it\r\nis then a favorable indication.\r\n\r\nPhthisis may be developed in consequence of an attack of influenza,\r\nand if phthisis be already established it is apt to run a more rapid\r\ncourse. Emphysematous affections are aggravated; diseases of the heart\r\nare unfavorably influenced; chronic nervous affections are made worse,\r\nand, in particular, neuralgias are aggravated. Old neuralgias, that\r\nhave long ceased to give trouble, occasionally reappear during the\r\nconvalescence.\r\n\r\nPersons subject to latent or chronic Bright's disease are especially\r\nliable to the more serious manifestations of influenza. The fatal\r\ntermination of such cases not unfrequently occurs in consequence of an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nMany of the older observers speak of the intermittent character of\r\n{871} influenza in certain epidemics, and its tendency to run into\r\nintermittents, particularly of a certain type, during convalescence.\r\nThis has not been observed in the outbreaks of later years, and it is\r\nprobable that in such instances an endemic malaria has modified the\r\nepidemic catarrhal fever, or the former has broken out as the latter\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nPregnant women are in danger of aborting.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY.--Our knowledge of the pathology of influenza is as yet very\r\nimperfect. Biermer has described it as the sum of a series of\r\ncatarrhal manifestations developed under a common epidemic influence.\r\nThe close association of the various local affections arises from\r\ntheir almost simultaneous occurrence as results of primary\r\npathological processes common to them all. Each of the three groups of\r\nsymptoms which make up the clinical picture of the disease--namely,\r\nthe fever, the catarrh, and the symptoms referable to the nervous\r\nsystem--constitutes a distinct factor of influenza, and is a direct\r\noutcome of the action of the infecting principle. There is no constant\r\ninterdependence among these groups, either in the order of their\r\nsuccession or in their intensity. Thus, while all three groups are\r\ncommonly present from the beginning of the attack, any one of them may\r\nbe the first to appear or have an intensity out of all proportion to\r\neach of the others. The fever is not a result of the catarrhal\r\ninflammation, nor are the nervous symptoms the result of both the\r\nothers. They all spring directly from the action of the same cause.\r\n\r\nThis view is at variance with the opinion--based upon the fact that\r\nordinary acute local inflammatory diseases, tonsillitis, bronchitis,\r\nand the like, sometimes run their course in a similar way to\r\ninfluenza, with fever, nervous depression, and a serious sense of\r\nillness--that influenza is a simple epidemic catarrhal inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe sudden onset of influenza, its not infrequent abrupt termination,\r\nwhich suggests crisis, its unsparing seizure of great numbers of the\r\npopulation, the severity of the nervous symptoms, and the amount of\r\nlaryngo-bronchial irritation, often out of measure with the lesions of\r\nthe mucous membranes,--all point to the action of a morbid agent\r\naffecting the body at large. The severity of the symptoms also, in\r\nmany cases, is much greater than in similar acute non-specific local\r\naffections, while the complications, and in particular the\r\nrecrudescence of fading neuralgias and the tendency to abortion, and\r\nthe sequels, as cough, weakness, headaches, flying pains, which often\r\nremain long after convalescence, are evidences of its belonging to the\r\ngroup of infectious diseases rather than to that of simple acute\r\ninflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it must be urged that the similarity of the symptoms in\r\nmany epidemics, occurring during the course of several centuries and\r\nunder different social conditions, and even different degrees of\r\ncivilization, forcibly demonstrates the specific and definite\r\ncharacter of the causes which give rise to influenza.\r\n\r\nVery little light is thrown upon the pathology of the disease by the\r\nanatomical changes found after death. Uncomplicated influenza is\r\nrarely fatal. As a rule, the unfavorable termination is due to lung\r\ncomplications. The essential lesions are congestion and catarrhal\r\nswelling of the mucous membrane of the upper air-passages and the\r\nbronchial tubes. These changes may be restricted, in the lungs, to the\r\ntrachea and larger {872} bronchi, or they may extend to the finest\r\ntwigs. They may amount to great thickening and deep capillary\r\ninjections of the mucous lining of the tubes, which contain clear,\r\nfrothy mucus or thick, viscid masses of muco-purulent secretion\r\nunmixed with air.\r\n\r\nMore or less congestion of the gastric mucous membrane, and more\r\nrarely of that of the intestine, is also met with. The solitary and\r\nagminate glands of the intestine are not affected, save as the result\r\nof special complications. A few observations relate to the finding of\r\nenlarged and softened bronchial glands. More extended researches are\r\nneeded, not only upon this point, but also in the whole domain of the\r\npathological anatomy of the disease.\r\n\r\nHyperæmia, oedema, hypostatic congestions, splenization, catarrhal\r\npneumonia, and hepatization affect the lung-tissue in cases fatal by\r\nthe complications which are associated with such changes. The\r\ntissue-changes of diseases existing prior to the attack of influenza,\r\nsuch as old consolidations, tubercle, brown induration, emphysema, and\r\nso forth, are of course frequently discovered.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The discrimination of influenza from other affections\r\nhaving some points of resemblance to it is, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, unattended with difficulty. The march of the epidemic,\r\nthe number of persons attacked, the prominence of the nervous\r\nsymptoms, the rapidly developed debility, and the character of the\r\ncough, usually severe out of proportion to the physical signs,\r\ndistinguish it from all other epidemic diseases.\r\n\r\nIt is to be differentiated from non-specific catarrhal affections\r\nattended by fever, malaise, weakness, severe headache, and pain in the\r\nextremities by a due regard to the causative relations of the two\r\naffections. Simple catarrhs not rarely present the group of symptoms\r\nwhich characterize epidemic catarrhal fever, but they occur almost\r\nconstantly as the result of great and sudden changes in the weather,\r\nand are therefore met with in greatest frequency in bad seasons, and\r\nare particularly common at the end of winter and in the spring.\r\nInfluenza is not in any way dependent upon the vicissitudes of the\r\nseasons, and may occur, as has been shown, at all times of the year,\r\nin wet or dry, mild or cold seasons equally, and in every variety of\r\nclimate. It is of course diagnosticated without difficulty from the\r\nsporadic catarrhal fevers, which lack the characteristic depression,\r\nneuralgic and rheumatoid pains, the irritative cough, dyspnoea, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nCases of influenza are met with that bear a strong resemblance to\r\nbeginning enteric fever. The malaise, headache, obtunded hearing,\r\nmental depression, high fever, coated tongue, tender belly, diarrhoea,\r\nare symptoms to be observed in both affections. But influenza lacks\r\nthe temperature curve, the splenic enlargement, and the eruption of\r\nenteric fever, and the progress of the disease will in a few days\r\nclear up the most doubtful case.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS AND MORTALITY.--Death is rare in uncomplicated cases. The\r\nvery young bear influenza badly; the old bear it more badly still.\r\nNevertheless, children have in some epidemics enjoyed a considerable\r\nproportionate immunity. Healthy persons in the middle periods of life\r\nbear it well. Certain pre-existing diseases modify its course\r\nunfavorably; among these are chronic bronchitis, emphysema, fatty\r\nheart, and Bright's disease. {873} The debility of advanced phthisis\r\nand other exhausting diseases renders influenza dangerous. Death takes\r\nplace, in by far the greater number of cases, as the result of the\r\ncomplication of the attack, either by some pre-existing affection or\r\nby an acute disease arising in its course. The commonest of the latter\r\nare inflammations of the parenchyma of the lungs.\r\n\r\nPatients presenting very severe symptoms generally recover if they be\r\nnot the subjects of complicating maladies or very young or very old.\r\n\r\nRelapses are not uncommon; independently of relapses, second attacks\r\nhave been known to occur during the continuance of an epidemic; it is\r\noften the case that an individual in the course of his life passes\r\nthrough several epidemics of influenza, and is the subject of the\r\ndisease in each of them.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is greatly modified by the character of the prevailing\r\nepidemic. In some epidemics the deaths are few, and the mortality from\r\nother diseases does not appear to be greatly augmented. In others many\r\ndie of the epidemic disease, and the death-rate of certain endemic\r\naffections is much increased. In some of the older epidemics the high\r\nmortality was doubtless due to injudicious measures of treatment,\r\namong which bloodletting and other depressing agencies were\r\nconspicuous. Some of the older accounts also warrant the suspicion\r\nthat a coexisting typhus had to do with the high death-rate. It is\r\nestimated that in the epidemic of 1837, which was a very severe one, 2\r\nper cent. of those attacked died. The proportion of fatal cases in\r\nparticular epidemics varies in different countries, and even in\r\ndifferent quarters of the same city.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Efficient measures of prophylaxis are as yet unknown.\r\nUnfavorable hygienic surroundings, overcrowding, a damp, unhealthy\r\nlocality, appear to increase the prevalence and severity of influenza.\r\nThe opposite conditions of living do not, however, secure immunity\r\nfrom the attack. During an epidemic aged persons, those enfeebled by\r\nchronic diseases, and in particular those subject to chronic\r\nbronchitis, consumption, emphysema, fatty heart, and Bright's disease\r\nshould be cared for with unusual diligence and solicitude, since they\r\nconstitute the classes most prone to the graver complications of the\r\ndisease, and from which its fatal cases are almost wholly derived.\r\nSuch individuals should be warmly clad; they should shun, so far as\r\npossible, the vicissitudes of the weather, even, if practicable,\r\nkeeping within warmed and well-ventilated apartments; they should\r\nexercise unusual prudence in diet and lead a carefully regulated life,\r\nwith long hours of sleep. It is true that these measures are not\r\npreventive of the attack. Families not quitting the house, living in\r\nthe greatest seclusion, even the bedridden, do not always, or even as\r\na rule, escape. Yet it has frequently been observed that those whose\r\noccupations are carried on in the open air are attacked earliest and\r\nin greatest numbers. On the other hand, in rare instances, persons\r\nisolated from the community with strictness--in prisons, cloisters,\r\nhospitals--have remained free from the disease prevailing around them.\r\nIt therefore appears probable that, under certain favorable\r\ncircumstances not as yet perfectly understood, the avoidance of the\r\nopen air and of the direct influences of the weather may confer some\r\ndegree of immunity from the attack, and it is desirable that the class\r\nof persons most liable to the graver consequences of the disease\r\nshould avail themselves of even the most uncertain precautions.\r\n\r\n{874} The treatment of influenza is expectant and supporting. Not only\r\nis the epidemic self-limiting, tending to exhaust the susceptibility\r\nof a community, in most instances, in the space of a few weeks, but\r\nthe attack is also of definite duration, and the perturbations set up\r\nby the action of the influenza-poison upon the individual subside\r\nspontaneously in three or four, or at most ten or twelve, days. The\r\nsusceptibility of the individual is also, for the time being,\r\nexhausted, for second attacks in the same epidemic are not very\r\ncommon. In cases where the duration of the attack is prolonged beyond\r\nthe period indicated, it is kept up by complications, and we have to\r\ndo not so much with the pathological processes of influenza as with\r\nsecondary diseases that the influenza has excited either by the\r\nintensity of its action or by reason of some peculiarity of the\r\nsubject of the attack.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest number of cases are light and unattended by\r\ndanger. The treatment is therefore, for the most part, an extremely\r\nsimple one. These lighter cases seldom require medical measures. The\r\npatients are uncomfortable and anxious, easily fatigued, and unfitted\r\nfor business. It is best that they keep the house, and, if willing,\r\nthe bed or sofa, for the space of two or three days. The diet should\r\nbe restricted to a few simple and easily-digested dishes. Meat should\r\nbe avoided. The common custom of taking hot beef-tea is an extremely\r\nbad one; it often increases the headache and languor. Moderate\r\nquantities of cold drinks may be taken. The fruit-syrups, lemonade,\r\nraspberry vinegar, a weak solution of citrate of potash or of cream of\r\ntartar, and barley-water with lemon, are useful. Very weak wine-whey\r\nis often liked. The effervescing mineral waters or Apollinaris are\r\npreferred by many persons. The best of such drinks is a mixture of\r\nequal parts of Seltzer-water and milk, iced. If the stomach be\r\nirritable, koumiss will be found an excellent beverage and food. In\r\nthe mild cases stimulants are not necessary. Sound claret, with or\r\nwithout Seltzer-water, is not contraindicated. In all cases the amount\r\nof fluid taken should be moderate.\r\n\r\nQuinine in moderate doses should be taken from the onset. The\r\nhead-pains are not increased by it. Dover's powder, if well borne,\r\nshould be administered at night. Some form of opiate may be required,\r\neven in mild cases, to counteract wakefulness. A compressed pill,\r\ncontaining extract of opium 0.030 gramme (gr. 1/2), camphor 0.15 (gr.\r\nij), and ammonium carbonate 0.15 (gr. ij), will be found useful when\r\nDover's powder cannot be employed. During convalescence iron and barks\r\nare often requisite.\r\n\r\nThe coryza, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis are to be treated\r\naccording to general principles, if they require treatment at all. In\r\nmost mild cases the catarrhal symptoms call for no special measures of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nFree inunctions of fatty substances about the brow and over the bridge\r\nof the nose are of use as regards the coryza. For this purpose animal\r\nfats, washed lard, simple cerate, cold cream, and the like are to be\r\npreferred to cosmoline and vaseline.\r\n\r\nMorphine dissolved in cherry-laurel water, one part in fifty or sixty,\r\nis useful for the relief of the head-pains associated with the coryza.\r\nA few drops may be snuffed up from time to time. These pains are\r\nmitigated to some degree by wearing a flannel cap or wrapping the head\r\nin a silk handkerchief. Warm applications sometimes give comfort,\r\nwhile cold almost invariably add to the distress.\r\n\r\n{875} Distress in the upper air-passages and the tickling cough call\r\nfor steam inhalations, and the air of the apartment may be rendered\r\nmoist by the evaporation of water kept boiling in a broad, shallow\r\nvessel. Gargles of potassium chlorate, or potassium chlorate with\r\nsumac, exert a soothing influence upon the congested tonsils.\r\n\r\nSevere cases call for more energetic measures of treatment. The most\r\nprominent indications are the control of the fever; the diminution of\r\nthe hyperæmic fluxion to the mucous tracts; measures of support; the\r\nmitigation of pain and the induction of sleep; and, finally, the\r\nprevention of the pulmonary congestion, to which the depression leads\r\nby enfeeblement of the circulation. The last indication is especially\r\nurgent in infants, the very old, and those previously debilitated from\r\nany cause.\r\n\r\nInflammatory complications require special treatment or modifications\r\nof treatment.\r\n\r\nThe febrile movement is not, as a rule, high; grave nervous symptoms\r\nand serious catarrh may be associated with moderate fever.\r\n\r\nAn anti-febrile regimen is to be observed. The moderate duration of\r\nthis fever, as compared with enteric fever, renders it less important\r\nthat large amounts of fever-food should be given, while the tendency\r\nto depression makes it of the utmost importance that the\r\nadministration of food be systematic and carefully looked after by the\r\nmedical attendant. The disinclination to take food is so great that it\r\nis often with difficulty that a sufficient quantity can be given in\r\nthe early days of the attack, and it is to be doubted whether benefit\r\nfollows anything in excess of the most moderate amount. It is\r\nnecessary to observe regular hours, as in the management of all the\r\nlow fevers. As soon as convalescence begins the patient should be\r\nurged to eat; the quantity of food taken at one time is to be\r\naugmented, and the intervals between the meals may be longer.\r\n\r\nA favorable action upon the excretory function of the skin and kidneys\r\nwill result from the moderate drinking of water or of the beverages\r\nalready spoken of. At least enough fluid should be taken to relieve\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nDiaphoretics have been much used, upon the theory that by\r\ndetermination to the skin they correspondingly diminish the tendency\r\nto hyperæmia of the affected mucous tracts. Dover's powder, solution\r\nof the acetate of ammonia, and other mild diaphoretics are to be\r\nselected. Jaborandi should be employed with caution. The wet pack and\r\nother hydrotherapeutic measures have been employed to act upon the\r\nskin and to effect a direct reduction of temperature in influenza. For\r\nold and feeble persons warm packs are employed. A profuse sweating at\r\nthe onset of the attack is said to occasionally cut it short. Early\r\ndiaphoresis often brings about a rapid and lasting amelioration of the\r\nsymptoms. It is to be borne in mind that the fever is rarely\r\nexcessive, and that sweating is not infrequently a troublesome\r\nsymptom. In some epidemics it has been a very troublesome one.\r\n\r\nGeneral bloodletting is not to be resorted to in influenza. Its danger\r\nwas apparent to some of the early writers. As has been pointed out,\r\nthe high mortality of some of the older epidemics is to be explained\r\nby the venesections practised at the beginning, and even during the\r\ncourse, of the attack. It has no favorable effect upon the catarrhal\r\nprocesses, and but little upon the subjective symptoms. The fever is\r\nnot relieved by it; the {876} nervous depression is increased and the\r\nrisk of lung-congestion is augmented. Bleeding is not likely to be\r\npractised in epidemic catarrhal fever while the present views of its\r\nplace in therapeutics continue to influence practice. Cautious local\r\nbloodletting for the relief of local inflammatory trouble is spoken of\r\nin most of the modern books. The occasions for its employment are so\r\nrare in the treatment of this disease that even this statement should\r\nbe henceforth omitted. In influenza, as it is known to medical men of\r\nthe present from the descriptions of the old and personal experience\r\nof the few recent and milder epidemics, bloodletting, either general\r\nor local, is clearly uncalled for.\r\n\r\nEmetics hold a high historical place. It was of old customary to begin\r\nthe treatment with a vomit. As late as the epidemic of 1837, Lombard\r\nof Geneva believed that they shortened the attack and lessened the\r\nintensity of the symptoms when administered at the beginning. In cases\r\nattended by early gastric disturbance and nausea they are said to be\r\nespecially of use. They sometimes set up great irritability of the\r\nstomach, with vomiting that it is difficult to control. On the whole,\r\nthe cases in which an emetic would do good are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nPurgatives were formerly regarded as important in the treatment. This\r\nview no longer prevails. In case of constipation gentle purgation, ex\r\nindicatione symptomaticâ, is a necessary part of the proper management\r\nof the case. For this purpose the laxative mineral waters, as\r\nFriederichshalle, Hunyadi, Pullna, are excellent. Castor oil may be\r\ngiven, and calomel is in some cases, and particularly in childhood, of\r\ngreat service. Simple enemata of warm water or soap and water will\r\noften suffice. The tendency in some cases to exhausting and\r\ntroublesome diarrhoea, and the fact that diarrhoea occurs\r\nspontaneously some time in the course of most cases, should inspire\r\ncaution in the use of purgatives. Repeated purgation during the\r\nprogress of the attack is not only useless--it is also positively\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nIn the severe cases quinine is to be given early and in full doses. It\r\nexerts at the same time a powerful influence upon the temperature,\r\nupon the tendency to local hyperæmias, and upon the nervous symptoms,\r\nand in particular the headache. Rawlins,[23] as early as 1833, found\r\nthat excellent results followed its administration, the effect being\r\nthe better the earlier it was given. It has even been lauded as a\r\nspecific for influenza.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _London Medical Gazette_, May, 1833.]\r\n\r\nThe mineral acids may be given with a view to realizing their tonic\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the foregoing measures, directed against the fever,\r\nwill exert a favorable influence upon the catarrhal processes.\r\nExpectorants are of advantage; ipecac is useful. The preparations of\r\nantimony are inadmissible by reason of their tendency to depress.\r\nAmmonium chloride is indicated in the earlier stages of the\r\nbronchitis. Among recent drugs, yerba santa (Eryodiction glutinosum)\r\nand the oil of eucalyptus are of use in mitigating the symptoms in\r\nepidemic catarrh, as they do in certain forms of simple sporadic\r\ncatarrh.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar dry, racking cough so often present in the early days of\r\nthe attack should be relieved. It is not useful in removing bronchial\r\naccumulations, being, as has been shown, in most instances out of\r\nproportion to the lesions of the bronchial mucous membrane; on the\r\nother {877} hand, it tends to increase the hyperæmia of the upper\r\nair-passages by the mechanical violence of the cough-paroxysms.\r\nFurther, it is distressing and exhausting, and contributes to the\r\nmuscular and nervous prostration. Benefit will be derived from keeping\r\nthe air of the apartment moist, and from the occasional inhalation of\r\nthe steam from hot water, either used alone or poured upon the\r\ncompound tincture of benzoin, a pint to the teaspoonful, or upon\r\nparegoric, a pint to the tablespoonful, in a proper vessel or inhaler.\r\n\r\nNo drugs are more potent to this end than opium and its derivatives,\r\nand in particular morphia and codeia. The hypodermic use of the\r\nmorphia salts, judiciously resorted to, constitutes our most valuable\r\ntherapeutic resource in fulfilling the threefold indication of\r\nrelieving cough, alleviating both the head-pain and the pains in the\r\nextremities, and in procuring sleep. The old-time dread of opium in\r\ninfluenza was not well founded. The administration of this drug in\r\nmoderate doses is attended with advantages that far outweigh any\r\ndanger of increasing the tightness across the chest and retarding\r\nexpectoration. It is necessary to observe the same caution in giving\r\nit to infants and aged persons in influenza that is necessary under\r\nother circumstances. The influence of carbolic acid in restraining\r\ncough makes it a useful addition to soothing draughts in this disease.\r\n\r\nThe substernal and other chest-pains may be combated with sinapisms,\r\nturpentine stupes, repeated inunctions of fatty substances containing\r\nextract of belladonna, and the like. Pleurodynic stitches call for\r\nsimilar measures; a long strip of machine-spread belladonna plaster,\r\nabout five centimetres (two inches) in width, applied very firmly to\r\nthe side of the chest from the spine in a direction downward and\r\nforward parallel with the ribs, and reaching to the median line in\r\nfront, affords great relief to the lateral chest-pains.\r\n\r\nThe control of the debility must be regarded as the most important\r\nindication in old and feeble persons. Wine, spirits, milk-punch,\r\nammonia, spirits of chloroform, are to be used, not in accordance with\r\nfixed rules, but as occasion may require. In many cases wine or\r\nwhiskey will be indicated from the beginning, the quantity being\r\ndetermined rather by the effect upon the circulation and the general\r\ncondition of the case than by rule. Women and others unaccustomed to\r\nthe use of alcoholic drinks often take wine and brandy in considerable\r\nquantities, with striking benefit and without flushing or other\r\nevidences of its disagreeing.\r\n\r\nChloral is inadmissible as a hypnotic by reason of its depressing\r\neffect upon the heart. Paraldehyde may be used, or the bromides in\r\nconnection with opium if the latter alone is not well borne.\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea must be managed in accordance with general principles. If\r\nslight, it does not require special treatment. It is apt to occur at\r\none period or another in the course of most cases, and not\r\ninfrequently marks the beginning of convalescence. Colic may be\r\ntreated with warm fomentations and carminatives; if it be due to\r\nconstipation, mild laxatives are to be combined with them.\r\n\r\nSevere cases of influenza demand the careful attention of the\r\nphysician, who must be on the alert to detect the inflammatory lung\r\ncomplications which so often lead up to the fatal issue as early as\r\npossible. Their treatment must be regulated by the circumstances of\r\nthe case, the nature {878} of the particular complication, the age of\r\nthe patient, and so on, in accordance with general therapeutical\r\nindications.\r\n\r\nFinally, all measures, of whatever kind, that tend to depress the\r\ngeneral nervous system or the functional activity of the respiration,\r\nand especially the heart-power, are to be sedulously avoided in the\r\nmanagement of influenza. During the convalescence unfavorable\r\ninfluences of the weather are to be guarded against. It is important\r\nto warn the patient that a severe attack of influenza renders him\r\nliable for some time afterward to pulmonary disorders. The sequels,\r\nand in particular those implicating the respiratory tract, are to be\r\nappropriately treated. After severe cases a course of tonics is\r\ncommonly of advantage, and a change of climate often necessary to\r\nre-establish the health.\r\n\r\nAs bearing on what is stated in the foregoing pages on the causation\r\nof influenza, reference may be made to the investigations of\r\nSeifert,[24] who claims to have found in the mucus expectorated by\r\npatients with influenza numbers of a peculiar micrococcus. It is\r\nevident, however, that no conclusions can be based upon these\r\nobservations until the results have been subjected to careful\r\nexamination in other epidemics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Volkmann's klinische Vorträge_, No. 240, June 20,\r\n1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{879}\r\n\r\nDENGUE.\r\n\r\nBY H. D. SCHMIDT, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Break-bone fever, Dandy fever.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--The history of this disease dates only from the second half\r\nof the last century, though it appears very probable that previous to\r\nthis time dengue existed in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia,\r\nwhence it was carried to Europe and America.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the disease has been known since 1764, when, up to 1768, it\r\nprevailed in Cadiz and Seville under the name of la piadosa or la\r\npantomina.[1] In 1780 it appeared in the form of an epidemic in\r\nPhiladelphia, where it was first noticed and described by Rush under\r\nthe name of bilious remitting fever, commonly called break-bone fever\r\non account of the violent pains attending it. Next it prevailed in\r\nCalcutta in 1824, and two years afterward it made its first appearance\r\non the southern coast of the United States, in Charleston and\r\nSavannah, where it prevailed to 1827. Toward the close of 1827 another\r\ndengue epidemic broke out in the West Indies, whence the disease\r\nproceeded to the American continent, reaching New Orleans in the\r\nspring, and visiting Charleston and Savannah in the summer and autumn\r\nof 1828.[2] In 1844 it showed itself in Mobile, and in 1848 in\r\nNatchez, whilst in 1850 it reappeared along the Southern seacoast,\r\nparticularly in Charleston, from which it proceeded even to inland\r\ntowns, such as Augusta, Ga.[3] In 1865 dengue appeared in Teneriffe\r\nand other Canary Islands, whilst at the same time and through the\r\nyears 1866 and 1867 it prevailed in Andalusia and in some other\r\nSpanish provinces.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: R. H. Poggio, _La calentura roja observada in sus\r\napariciones epidemicas de los anos 1865 y 1867_, Madrid (reported in\r\n_Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht für das Jahr 1871_, vol. ii. p.\r\n200).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: G. B. Wood, _Practice of Medicine_, 4th ed., vol. i. p.\r\n444.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: S. H. Dickson, _Elements of Medicine_, 2d. ed., p. 747.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: R. H. Poggio, _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht für das\r\nJahr 1871_, vol. ii. p. 200.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive epidemics of dengue prevailed from July,\r\n1870, to January, 1871, in Zanzibar,[5] on the East Coast of Africa,\r\nwhence it extended to Aden in Arabia and Port Said in Egypt. In\r\nDecember, 1871, the disease appeared simultaneously at Bombay and\r\nCalcutta,[6] to which place it had been carried by transport-ships\r\nfrom Aden. Proceeding from Bombay in a northern direction along the\r\nrailroad, it spread {880} over the central regions of the\r\nNorth-western Provinces, the Rajputana states, Cashmir, and the\r\nPunjaub. From Calcutta it passed over Assam and Bhotan to Thibet, and\r\nthence downward into Burmah and to all the large cities along the\r\ncoast; while it also extended along the coast of Malabar over\r\nVisigapatam to Madras and Pondichery, finally arriving at Mysore. Thus\r\nthe disease had actually spread over the whole Peninsula from Cape\r\nTutikorin to the foot of the Himalayas, attacking equally all races or\r\nnationalities without regard to age, occupation, or position. Forty\r\nyears previously, however, an epidemic of dengue had prevailed in\r\nBurmah. In 1873 it appeared on the island of Mauritius, to which it\r\nhad been carried from India by an emigrant ship. In the same year a\r\nconsiderable number of cases of dengue were observed in New Orleans.\r\nIn 1877 it appeared again in Egypt, where it prevailed in Ismailia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: J. Christie, \"Remarks on Kidniga Pepo, a peculiar form of\r\nexanthematous disease epidemic in Zanzibar, East Coast of Africa, from\r\nJuly, 1870, to January, 1871,\" _Brit. Med. Journal_, July 1, 1872, p.\r\n577 (reported in _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht für das Jahr\r\n1872_, vol. ii. p. 203).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht für das Jahr 1873_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 208.]\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1880, dengue, in the form of a very extensive epidemic,\r\nprevailed once more along the Southern coast, visiting equally\r\nCharleston, Savannah, and New Orleans. A number of valuable\r\nobservations concerning the nature and symptoms of the disease were\r\nmade during this epidemic by Drs. D. C. Holliday of New Orleans, J. G.\r\nThomas of Savannah, and F. T. Porcher and J. Forrest of Charleston.[7]\r\nAt the same time it prevailed at Alexandria[8] (Egypt) to such an\r\nextent as to affect nearly the whole population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The papers of Drs. Holliday, Thomas, and Porcher were\r\nread before the American Public Health Association at its annual\r\nmeeting, December, 1880, and published in the _Proceedings_ of the\r\nAssociation. Dr. Forrest's paper was published in the _American\r\nJournal of Med. Science_, April, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: A. Vernoni, \"Le Dengue à Alexandrie d'Égypte en 1880,\"\r\n_Gaz. hebd. de méd. et de chir._, 41, 42 (reported in _Virchow und\r\nHirsch's Jahresbericht für das Jahr 1880_, vol. ii. p. 5).]\r\n\r\nDengue has been known under various popular names which it received\r\nfrom the people of the particular localities where it appeared in\r\nepidemic form. Even the designation, dengue, itself, by which the\r\ndisease is at present generally known to the medical profession of the\r\nleading civilized nations, is of popular origin,[9] for it is supposed\r\nto be a Spanish corruption of the word dandy, the name of dandy-fever\r\nhaving been jocosely conferred on the disease by the negroes of St.\r\nThomas from the stiff carriage of those affected with it. At Zanzibar\r\nit received the popular name of kidniga pepo, signifying spasmodic\r\npains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: G. B. Wood, _Practice of Medicine_, 4th edit., vol. i. p.\r\n444.]\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Dengue is a peculiar febrile disease, generally appearing\r\nepidemically in tropical or semi-tropical regions, and characterized\r\nby a single paroxysm with or without remissions, severe pains, and\r\nstiffness in the joints and muscles, a peculiar exanthematous\r\neruption, and almost never terminating fatally.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS, COURSE, AND DURATION.[10]--Dengue never commences with a\r\ndecided chill, though in many cases the attack of the disease is\r\npreceded by a feeling of general uneasiness and depression, vertigo,\r\nand headache, or even by a slight chilliness--a condition which may\r\nlast from a few to twelve or even eighteen hours. In the majority of\r\ncases, however, the disease appears suddenly, very frequently at\r\nnight, and announces itself at once by pains and a feeling of\r\nstiffness in the muscles, joints, back, and loins; in severe cases the\r\npain may even extend to the {881} bones.[11] The larger and smaller\r\njoints are equally affected, either simultaneously or successively,\r\nand frequently swollen, those of the hands and feet generally before\r\nthe others. The pain in the joints is increased by motion, and is\r\ntherefore justly regarded by most authors as rheumatic in nature. The\r\nsame may be said of the muscles. Sheriff even observed redness of the\r\nskin covering the joints. According to the degree of severity of the\r\ncase these pains may be more or less intense. In some cases\r\nhyperæsthesia of the skin of the palms of the hands and of the soles\r\nof the feet has been observed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Judging from the various accounts rendered by a\r\nconsiderable number of observers, it appears that the clinical\r\nsymptoms of dengue had been the same in all the different localities\r\non the globe where it has hitherto prevailed epidemically.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: M. Sheriff, \"History of the Epidemic of Dengue in Madras\r\nin 1872,\" _Med. Times and Gazette_, Nov. 15, p. 543 (reported in\r\n_Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht für das Jahr 1873_).]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the affection of the joints and muscles the fever\r\ncommences; its duration is from four to five days on the average, with\r\none or, in exceptional cases, even more remissions. The temperature of\r\nthe body during the first and second days of the fever rises to 102,\r\n103, or even to 105° F; it then declines, to return to the normal\r\nstandard on the fifth day. According to the measurements made by the\r\nlate Dr. D'Aquin[12] of New Orleans, the temperature curves of dengue\r\nshowed a continuous and steady rise until the highest point was\r\nreached on the first, second, or third day of the attack; then comes a\r\nshort stadium of a few hours, and then a remission, soon to be\r\nfollowed by another rise of temperature, which, however, never reaches\r\nthe maximum point of the first. The pulse rises with the temperature\r\nof the body, generally to from 80 to 120 beats a minute, and\r\nsubsequently declines with the temperature. Delirium is very rarely\r\nobserved in adults, but frequently in children, though without\r\naggravation of the other symptoms. The face is generally flushed, the\r\neyelids swollen, and the eyes injected and watery. The tongue in the\r\nbeginning of the disease is covered with a white fur; its edges are\r\nred and its body swollen. As the disease advances the coating\r\nincreases in thickness and assumes a dirty yellow color. The appetite\r\nis lost, without excessive thirst. In many cases there is slight\r\nirritability of the stomach, accompanied sometimes with nausea, though\r\nvomiting rarely takes place. The condition of the bowels is variable.\r\nThe urine is small in quantity, and highly colored in some cases,\r\nwhilst in others it has been reported to be pale and copious, and rich\r\nin phosphates in the beginning of the disease; it seldom shows any\r\nsediments and very rarely contains albumen. The disease generally\r\nreaches its acme on the third or fourth day, when the fever commences\r\nto subside, and an amelioration of the other symptoms takes place, so\r\nthat the patient feels greatly relieved. This, however, is only of\r\nshort duration, for not many hours afterward the fever rises again,\r\nwhile the other symptoms also increase in severity. At this time an\r\nexanthematous eruption appears upon the upper part of the body, the\r\nface, neck, breast, and shoulders, which in the course of two days\r\nextends over the whole body. Simultaneously with the appearance of the\r\neruption the lymphatic glands of the back of the head and those of the\r\nneck, axillæ, and groins commence to swell; in severe cases the mucous\r\nmembranes of the nose, mouth, and pharynx also become congested. The\r\neruption, which is attended with much heat, itching, or even pain, is\r\nnot uniform in character; for while in some cases it may {882}\r\nrepresent a simple rash or erythema, it resembles in others the\r\neruptions of scarlatina, rubeola, lichen, or urticaria. Frequently it\r\nis very light and evanescent, showing itself only for a few hours, and\r\nperhaps in the majority of cases it does not appear at all. In the\r\nseverer cases it generally remains two days, when it commences to fade\r\nand disappear with desquamation, while at the same time the fever\r\nsubsides and disappears entirely, though the stiffness and soreness in\r\nthe joints and muscles, together with the inflammatory condition of\r\nthe superficial lymphatic glands, may persist for many weeks. In\r\nexceptional cases the eruption, after an intermission of a few days,\r\nreappears, generally with greater intensity and with an aggravation of\r\nthe other symptoms. In others, again, it has been observed to remain a\r\nwhole week.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: D. C. Holliday, \"Dengue or Dandy Fever,\" read before the\r\nAmer. Publ. Health Assoc. at New Orleans, December, 1880.]\r\n\r\nHemorrhages from the nose and gums are also occasionally observed.\r\nHolliday even observed the occurrence of black vomit in the cases of\r\ntwo female children, aged respectively six and twelve, in the same\r\nfamily, who had suffered from yellow fever in 1878; they both\r\nrecovered from the attack of dengue, though they were extremely ill\r\nand much prostrated. In female patients an attack of dengue not\r\nunfrequently causes the reappearance of the menstrual flow, while the\r\npains attending the disease equally predispose to premature labor in\r\npregnant women.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases of dengue the prostration following upon the\r\nsubsidence of the fever is very great, for the patient is affected\r\nwith a general weakness both of body and mind, indicating a great loss\r\nof nervous energy. In some cases observed by Slaughter the memory for\r\nnames and words, as well as the ability for correctly writing even\r\nshort sentences, was lost for one or two weeks after the commencement\r\nof convalescence. In children also cases are reported in which the\r\nmind remained affected for a short time after the attack. The\r\nconvalescence in dengue, therefore, is comparatively slow,\r\nparticularly as the pains in the muscles and joints, as already\r\nmentioned, pass away only gradually.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the disease, including the stage of convalescence, of\r\ncourse depends upon the degree of intensity of the attack, and\r\naccordingly varies in different cases. In a great number of cases\r\ndengue manifests itself only in its milder form. The average duration\r\nof the disease is from three to six days.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY.--The pathological changes taking place in the different\r\norgans during the course of dengue are unknown, on account of the\r\nalmost constantly favorable termination of the disease. From the\r\npeculiar features of some of the clinical symptoms accompanying the\r\ndisease, however, we may speculate to a certain extent upon the nature\r\nof the pathological processes to which they are due. The sudden\r\nappearance of the characteristic pains in the muscles and joints, but\r\nparticularly those in the head, neck, and loins, accompanied by a\r\ncomparatively high fever, evidently point to the presence of an\r\ninfectious poison in the system, though the question whether the\r\nnoxious influence of this poison primarily affects the blood or the\r\nnervous system will be difficult to answer. But, judging from the\r\nearly appearance of the pains, as well as from the physical and mental\r\ndepression of the patient, we may presume that the nervous system is\r\ninvolved from the very beginning of the disease, and that the pains\r\ndepend upon a hyperæmic condition of the affected parts, probably\r\ncaused by a vaso-motor paralysis. The great resemblance of the painful\r\n{883} affection of the muscles and joints in dengue to that of acute\r\narticular rheumatism leads to the supposition that the pathological\r\ncondition in these joints is the same in both diseases; this view\r\nappears to be held by the majority of medical observers. In dengue, as\r\nin rheumatism, the pain due to the pressure of the hyperæmic and\r\nswollen tissues upon the irritated sensory nervous filaments is\r\nincreased by motion--a phenomenon generally absent in neuralgia. The\r\npersistent headache, restlessness, and want of sleep, as well as the\r\ndelirium and loss of memory observed in the severer cases, furthermore\r\nindicate a hyperæmic condition not only of the pia mater, but even of\r\nthe brain-substance.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the literature of dengue within our reach\r\nshows no record of a quantitative analysis of the urine, from which we\r\nmight have learned the quantity of urea secreted during the different\r\nstages of the disease, and which might have enabled us to form some\r\nidea of the extent of the destruction of the albuminous substances\r\nduring the febrile stage, though, judging from the high grade of fever\r\nobserved in the severer cases, we may well presume that the\r\ninterchanges of matter are considerably augmented during this stage;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the great nervous prostration of the patient\r\ndirectly after the subsidence of the fever, as well as the tardy\r\nconvalescence, sufficiently shows that a large part of this waste is\r\nderived from the nervous tissues. The exanthematous eruption,\r\nrepresenting a hyperæmia, or even an inflammation, of the skin,\r\nfurthermore contributes to depress the nervous system by the pain and\r\nitching which it causes. This eruption, together with the inflammation\r\nand swelling of the superficial lymphatic glands, we are inclined to\r\nassociate with the final elimination of the infectious poison from the\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nVery little also is definitely known about the condition of the\r\nremaining organs, such as the kidneys, liver, and alimentary canal.\r\nThe examinations of the urine in dengue recorded in literature are\r\nvery few in number, and appear too unreliable for drawing any definite\r\nconclusions from them with regard to the condition of the kidneys. As\r\nalbuminuria is met with in other infectious diseases, it is not\r\nimpossible that it has also occurred in severe cases of dengue; though\r\nfrom the favorable termination of the disease it appears quite\r\nimprobable that organic changes take place in these organs. In the\r\nsame way may the liver be functionally deranged, or, judging from the\r\ndestruction of matter during the febrile stage, a slight fatty\r\ninfiltration of the organ may even occur--conditions which are apt to\r\npass away with the exciting cause. The gastric irritability, whenever\r\npresent, may be of nervous origin, though the vomiting, and\r\nparticularly that of black hemorrhagic matters, observed in\r\nexceptional cases, evidently depends upon a hyperæmia of the stomach.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--There is nothing positively known of the origin of dengue,\r\nbut in perusing the accounts given by a number of medical observers\r\nfrom the different localities of the globe where it prevailed, we may\r\npresume that it existed in some parts of Asia and Africa long before\r\nit appeared in Europe and America. Perhaps the earliest record of\r\ndengue is the one dating from Cadiz and Seville, and concerning the\r\nepidemics prevailing in the cities in 1764 and 1768, when it was\r\nbelieved by the people that the disease had been imported from Africa.\r\nIn Zanzibar (Christie), during the epidemic of 1870, the older native\r\ninhabitants {884} remembered that fifty years before the disease had\r\nprevailed in this place. The Arabians living at this island also had\r\nknown the disease in their own country, while the inhabitants hailing\r\nfrom the East Indies had never seen it. From the accounts of other\r\nwriters we may presume that dengue has been known in Arabia for many\r\ngenerations. But, leaving aside its origin, it is authentically known\r\nthat wherever dengue has appeared it has almost always been in the\r\nform of an epidemic, spreading from place to place and from family to\r\nfamily, without respect to race or nationality, to age, occupation or\r\nposition, until every one susceptible to the disease was affected.\r\nSlaughter reports from India that even domestic animals, especially\r\ndogs and cats, were not exempt, as they appeared to suffer from\r\nrheumatoid affections of the joints.\r\n\r\nAlthough toward the end of the last century dengue once prevailed\r\nepidemically in the temperate zone, at Philadelphia, it must\r\nnevertheless be considered as a disease especially at home in the\r\ntropical and semi-tropical regions, where it prefers to haunt low\r\nlands, particularly along the sea-coast, leaving almost untouched more\r\nelevated places. Though nothing definite is known about its special\r\ncause, its history and symptoms evidently show that it is not only\r\ninfectious, but also highly contagious, in its nature, and in\r\nconsequence must be caused by the entrance of a specific poison into\r\nthe system. This view is held by the great majority of physicians\r\nresiding in the various localities of the globe where the disease has\r\nprevailed. But, contagious as it may be, it greatly distinguishes\r\nitself from other contagious diseases by almost never proving fatal.\r\nAs dengue generally prevails in the summer season and disappears with\r\nthe approach of cold and rainy weather, its cause is apparently\r\nsubject to the influence of certain meteorological conditions.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--When dengue appears epidemically, it is distinguished from\r\nother diseases without difficulty. The only disease with which it\r\nmight be confounded when appearing in a sporadic form is acute\r\narticular rheumatism. But even from this affection it may be\r\ndistinguished in its earlier stage by the pains not being limited to\r\nthe joints, as is generally the case in articular rheumatism, but\r\nbeing also present in the head, back, and loins. Dengue is, moreover,\r\ncharacterized by a general physical and mental nervous depression,\r\nwhile in rheumatism the mind almost always remains clear. In the\r\nlatter stage the peculiar eruption and painful swelling of the\r\nsuperficial lymphatic glands in dengue decides the question.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been stated that dengue resembles yellow fever, and\r\nsome physicians have even regarded it as a mild form of this disease.\r\nIn examining attentively, however, the temperature of the patient\r\nduring the febrile stage, it will be found that while it steadily\r\nrises in yellow fever, it is remittent in dengue. There is,\r\nfurthermore, a difference observed in the state of the pulse, which in\r\nyellow fever generally falls on the third day, while the temperature\r\ncontinues to rise; in dengue, on the contrary, the pulse rises with\r\nthe temperature. In the condition of the stomach also dengue\r\nconsiderably differs from yellow fever, for while in the latter\r\ndisease this organ is almost always irritable, and vomiting is very\r\nfrequently present, it is but rarely affected in dengue. The urine in\r\nyellow fever very frequently contains albumen as soon as the third\r\nday; in dengue, almost never, so far as the analyses recorded enable\r\nus {885} to judge. Finally, the absence of jaundice and the appearance\r\nof the eruption on the fourth or fifth day remove all doubt about the\r\nnature of the disease. There are a number of other points by which\r\ndengue may be distinguished from yellow fever, which we, however,\r\nforbear to enumerate, for the reason that those already mentioned will\r\nsuffice for a correct differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--Dengue, as has been stated before, scarcely ever\r\nterminates fatally unless it is complicated by some intercurrent\r\ndisease. The prognosis, therefore, is highly favorable.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Nearly all authors recommend a symptomatic treatment in\r\ndengue, beginning with a mild cathartic, mercurial or not, and\r\nfollowed by a mild diaphoretic. To relieve pain and procure sleep\r\nopium--either uncombined or in the form of Dover's powder--belladonna,\r\ncamphor, assafoetida, valerian, etc. have been recommended by\r\ndifferent physicians; liniments containing camphor or chloroform have\r\nalso been used with advantage for the same purpose. Foot-baths have\r\nbeen recommended to relieve the headache. To relieve the stiffness of\r\nthe muscles and the articular pains after the subsidence of the fever\r\niodide of potassium appears to be a favorite remedy in the East.\r\nColchicum combined with aconite is also recommended for this purpose,\r\nas well as artificial sulphur baths and massage. The nervous\r\ndepression during convalescence is to be combated with tonics and with\r\nregulation of the diet. Quinia appears to be generally discarded as a\r\nremedy in dengue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{886}\r\n\r\nRABIES AND HYDROPHOBIA.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES LAW, F.R.C.V.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--Canine Madness, Rabidus Canis, Canis Rabiosa. _Greek_,\r\nLyssa, Lytta, Lyssa Canina, Cynolyssa, Hydrophobia, Pantephobia,\r\nÆrophobia, Phobodipsia, Erethismus Hydrophobia, Clonos Hydrophobia,\r\nDyscataposis. _French_, Tetanus Rabien, La Rage, Toxicose Rabique.\r\n_German_, Wuth, Hundswuth, Tollwuth, Wuthkrankheit, Hundtollheit.\r\n_Italian_, Rabbia, Arabiata. _Spanish_, Rabia, Rabiosa. _Swedish_,\r\nHundsjuka. _Roumanian_, Turbarea.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Canine madness is an acute infectious disease, supposed\r\nto arise spontaneously in the genus Canis (dog, wolf, fox, etc.) and\r\nFelis (cat, etc.), but transmissible by inoculation to the other\r\nMammalia and to birds. It is characterized by a long period of\r\nincubation, by exaggerated reflex excitability, by disorder of the\r\nintellectual, emotional, and other nervous functions, by change of\r\nhabits, by extreme irritability of temper, by optical and other\r\ndelusions, by spasms of the muscles of the eyeballs and throat, by\r\nparalysis, and by more or less fever. The disease runs a short and\r\nalmost without exception fatal course.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--Plutarch claims that hydrophobia was first recognized by the\r\nAsclepiadæ, and Homer's allusions to the malign dog-star and to\r\nHector's acting like a raging dog have been quoted as implying a\r\nknowledge of rabies. We find no certain reference to the affection,\r\nhowever, until we come to Democritus and Aristotle, in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. The latter clearly describes the disease and uses the\r\nname lytta, but, singularly enough, claims for man an exemption from\r\nthe general susceptibility to the infection by inoculation.[1] From\r\nthat date to this the successive outbreaks, sufficiently noteworthy to\r\nsecure a place in history, are so numerous and widespread as to show a\r\ncontinuous prevalence of the malady in the Old World, and, since the\r\nearly part of the eighteenth century, in the New.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Historia Animalium_, lib. viii. cap. 22.]\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--Rabies is more prevalent in temperate\r\nregions than in the tropics and Arctic Circle, but this is common to\r\nall animal plagues propagated solely or mainly by contagion, and is\r\nmanifestly due chiefly to the density of population, the activity of\r\ncommerce, and the free movement of men and animals in the temperate\r\nzone. That a hot or cold climate is incompatible with rabies is\r\ndisproved by its prevalence under the tropics in Southern China,\r\nIndia, Abyssinia, the West Indies, Peru, Chili, and Brazil, and in the\r\nArctic Circle in Northern Greenland, Lapland, Siberia, and Kamtchatka.\r\nOn the other hand, many {887} islands and secluded regions in the\r\ntemperate zones maintain a continued immunity or have been invaded\r\nonly recently by the introduction of infected dogs. We may instance\r\nthe Hebrides, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, South Africa, West\r\nAfrica, the Azores, St. Helena, and, until the last half century, La\r\nPlata, Malta, and Hong-Kong. The disease is well known throughout\r\nNorth Africa, Arabia, Syria, Turkey, and Asia generally, in Ceylon and\r\nother of the East Indian islands. It is also notorious that even when\r\nunusually prevalent its progress is often abruptly arrested by a\r\nconsiderable river, and Schrader and Virchow both notice that though\r\nit ravaged both banks of a river, yet the islands in the river\r\nescaped, as was notorious of the islands in the Elbe during the great\r\nHamburg epizoötic in 1852-53. While, therefore, rabies prevails most\r\nextensively in the more civilized countries and in large cities, yet\r\nwe can point to no geographical area in which the contagion has failed\r\nto spread among those bitten by rabid animals, nor to any locality in\r\nwhich the disease has been shown to arise spontaneously from\r\nunwholesome conditions of climate, soil, or general environment.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--We know of but one efficient cause of rabies--namely,\r\ninfection. Yet as many conditions are believed to favor its extension,\r\nor even to determine its spontaneous eruption, it is necessary to\r\nspeak of them shortly.\r\n\r\nAs shown above, climate cannot be charged with the generation nor\r\ndiffusion of rabies. Many countries formerly thought exempt are now\r\nknown to suffer. The following may be named: The East and West Indies,\r\nSyria, Egypt, Cyprus, Siberia, the lands north of the Baltic, and\r\nSouth America. Others manifestly maintain their exemption only because\r\nthe morbid germ has not yet been introduced.\r\n\r\nCertain seasons undeniably show a far wider extension of the disease\r\nthan others, but such epizoötics are not limited to a particular\r\nseason or year, and, unless cut short by human intervention, cover a\r\nsuccession of years of the most varied climatic character, spare\r\ninaccessible or secluded islands in the very centre of the outbreak,\r\nand the cycles of prevalence will succeed each other, in place of\r\noccurring simultaneously, in closely adjacent countries subject to the\r\nsame climatic vicissitudes, but separated by narrow seas. Even a broad\r\nriver destitute of bridges usually abruptly arrests an epizoötic, and\r\nprotects the land beyond lying under precisely the same general\r\ninfluences. In this connection may be quoted the recent great\r\nepizoötic of 1856-72 in England, which succeeded, but did not\r\naccompany, that of 1851-56 in Germany. Prof. Röll reports the\r\nextraordinary prevalence of rabies at Vienna in 1814, 1815, 1830,\r\n1838, 1842, and 1862--years remarkable for diversity rather than\r\nuniformity of climatic characters.\r\n\r\nPopular opinion refers rabies to the extreme heats of summer, and each\r\nyear dogs are muzzled or otherwise confined by order of municipal\r\nauthorities during the dog days, though left at liberty throughout the\r\nrest of the year. In 1780, Andry observed that the coldest and hottest\r\nmonths furnished the least number of cases, and later Hurtrel\r\nD'Arboval claimed that in France dogs suffered most in May and\r\nSeptember, and wolves in March and April. Bouley claims that the\r\nmajority of dogs suffer in March, April, and May. The following\r\nstatistics are interesting in this connection: {888}\r\n\r\n                      _Cases of Rabies in_\r\n        WINTER.       SPRING.       SUMMER.        AUTUMN.\r\n      Dec., Jan.,  March, April,  June, July,   Sept., Oct.,\r\n         Feb.          May.          Aug.           Nov.\r\n  Dogs   755           857           788            696      (Bouley).\r\n  Men     17            25            42             13      (Boudin).\r\n\r\nThe increase of cases of rabies canina in the spring and summer\r\nmonths, as shown by the above statistics (7-15 per cent.), cannot\r\nreasonably be attributed to the influence of the weather, since even\r\nthe strongest advocates for spontaneity would at once decline to claim\r\nany such ratio of spontaneous developments. The increase must\r\ntherefore be mainly, if not altogether, due to the increased number of\r\ninoculations; and these latter are provided for in the jealousies and\r\nquarrels in the troops of males that follow each rutting bitch in\r\nspring, the principal period of oestrum in the canine female. The\r\ninfection spread in this way in early spring tends to remain more\r\nprevalent throughout the hot summer months.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the greatly enhanced mortality in man during the summer\r\nmonths, as shown in Boudin's statistics for France, in the absence of\r\nany genuine hydrophobia in man apart from inoculation from a rabid\r\nanimal, it may be attributed to three principal causes: 1st. The bites\r\nsustained from rabid dogs in spring and early summer, when the disease\r\nis most widely spread among these animals, will give rise to\r\nhydrophobia weeks or months later. 2d. In the warm season the body is\r\nmore thinly clad and the hands and other portions are more frequently\r\nleft bare, so that the teeth are less likely to be cleansed of the\r\nvirulent saliva by passing through the clothes before entering the\r\nskin. 3d. The languor, fever, and nervousness attendant on extreme\r\nheat tend not only to hasten the activity of any disease-germs\r\nactually present in the system, but also strongly favor the increase\r\nof that nervous fear which so often generates a fatal\r\npseudo-hydrophobia (lyssophobia) in persons that have been bitten by\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nHunger, thirst, and spoiled food are invoked as causes of rabies, yet\r\nin the East, where the dogs are the scavengers of the cities and often\r\nsuffer severely from hunger and thirst, eat the most offensive\r\ncarrion, and drink the foulest water, the disease has a very\r\nrestricted prevalence, while in South Africa and Australia the outcast\r\nand sheep-dogs, often the victims of starvation and thirst, entirely\r\nescape. Bourgelat, Dupuytren, Majendie, Breschet, and others have\r\ncruelly destroyed dogs by privation of food and water and by exposure\r\nunder a broiling sun, but no rabies, nor anything resembling it, was\r\nproduced. Dogs perspire little and suffer severely from heat, but\r\nthere is no evidence that this can develop canine madness. It is\r\nclaimed that Rossi of Turin developed rabies in cats by withholding\r\nfood and drink, but, as he furnishes no inoculation-tests confirmatory\r\nof its virulence, the claim cannot be endorsed. Experiments with an\r\nexclusive diet of salt meat, putrid meat, and water only have failed\r\nto produce rabies.\r\n\r\nThe large preponderance of male dogs attacked with rabies has been\r\nconstantly remarked by writers. Of 1990 rabid dogs reported by\r\ndifferent authors, 1746 were males and 244 females--a ratio of more\r\nthan 7 to 1. This excess of males attacked is much higher than the\r\nratio of males in the dogs of the districts drawn upon. Thus, Bourrel\r\nfound a {889} ratio of 6 rabid males to 1 rabid female, while in his\r\npatients generally the proportion was 4 to 1. Leblanc found that 14\r\nper cent. of the male dogs went mad, while but 1 per cent. of the\r\nfemales suffered. That sex is no protection against inoculated virus\r\nis shown by the frequent inoculation of castrated dogs of both sexes.\r\nThe excess of male subjects may be attributed mainly to the frequency\r\nwith which these bite each other when following a female in heat, and\r\nthe respect of all alike for the latter sex. Even in the rabid dog the\r\nsexual instinct rises above the propensity to bite in the early stages\r\nof the malady.\r\n\r\nToffoli claims that he has caused spontaneous rabies by shutting up\r\nseveral dogs in a loose box with a bitch in heat and allowing them to\r\nfight for the prize. Weber and Leblanc have noticed similar\r\noccurrences. But Greve and Menecier have repeated the experiments with\r\na contrary result; so that it remains probable that when successful\r\nthe victims had already been inoculated before they were shut up.\r\nMoreover, the seclusion of male canine animals for a lifetime in\r\nmenagerie cages, often adjoining those of their corresponding females,\r\nhas never been known to induce rabies.\r\n\r\nThe bite of the violently enraged dog, and the bites mutually given\r\nwhen following a rutting bitch, are popularly supposed to cause\r\nrabies; but if this were the case, the disease must have been\r\nuniversally prevalent. The idea that the bite of a dog will cause\r\nhydrophobia should that dog at any subsequent period go mad is a\r\nsimilar delusion. Men doubtless occasionally develop lyssophobia under\r\nsuch an influence, but animals do not contract genuine rabies.\r\n\r\nDogs are alleged to have gone mad from violent suffering after an\r\noperation, and cats from being scalded or robbed of their kittens, but\r\nall such causes are continually operating without such effect, and\r\nwhen in a solitary case rabies develops, it can only be looked on as a\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\nMuch popular prejudice exists against certain breeds, and the\r\nPomeranian has been virtually ostracised on account of its supposed\r\nliability to rabies; but statistics show that the liability to\r\ncontract the affection bears a relation to the exposure rather than\r\nthe special breed. Eckel, Pillwax, and Hertwig found that dogs kept as\r\nhouse- or watch-dogs, and most pampered and confined, are the most\r\nliable, while St. Cyr and Peuch found the greatest number of cases\r\namong those running at large and allowed the freest exercise.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular belief that the bite of the skunk (_Mephitis\r\nmephitica_) is always rabific. Rev. H. C. Hovey describes a number of\r\ncases of infection from this animal,[2] and John G. Janeway has\r\nreported other instances.[3] Both claim that the disease is\r\nspontaneous in the skunk, and Mr. Hovey holds, on very insufficient\r\ngrounds, that the affection is a distinct variety of rabies (rabies\r\nmephitica). The facts seem to warrant only the conclusion that skunks\r\nin certain districts of Michigan and Kansas have had rabies\r\ncommunicated to them, and follow the rabid impulse to bite other\r\nanimals and men. The Mephitinæ abound in the Eastern States, but we\r\nnever hear of them stealing up and biting men or dogs, nor of the\r\nlatter contracting rabies from skunk-bite. Eastern dogs frequently\r\nkill skunks and sustain bites, but do not thereby contract rabies.\r\nEven in Kansas this evil {890} influence of the skunk-bite was unknown\r\nuntil 1870, showing that it is not inherent in the climate nor soil,\r\nbut has been presumably imported. The spontaneity of the affection is\r\nassumed, not proved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Amer. Jour. of Science and Art_, May, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _New York Medical Record_, March 13, 1875.]\r\n\r\nIn the above epitome of alleged causes we find nothing proving the\r\nspontaneous evolution of rabies. The prevalence of the affection in\r\nwolves, foxes, jackals, cats, skunks, etc. proves nothing for\r\nspontaneity, more than its existence in the dog. In all these species\r\nof animals the malady develops the dread propensity to bite, and thus\r\nin all alike provision is made for the perpetuation and propagation of\r\nthe malady. Unless a previous attack by a rabid animal has been\r\nobserved, owners usually insist that their dogs have contracted the\r\nmalady spontaneously, yet a rigid scrutiny will almost always reveal a\r\nstrong probability, at least, of inoculation. The rabid dog wanders\r\nfar from home, and sometimes accomplishes wonderful feats of leaping\r\nto reach his victim, so that his presence in a district is not even\r\nsuspected, and animals thought to be safely secluded inside high walls\r\nsuffer from his fangs. He is more inclined to bite and rush on than to\r\nstay and devour, and thus small animals, like the skunk, when bitten\r\nmay survive to propagate the disease in places to which a dog could\r\nnot possibly find access. Much circumstantial evidence makes strongly\r\nagainst the theory of spontaneity. Thus, the immunity of the islands\r\nof the Elbe in the very midst of a severe and protracted epizoötic,\r\nthe continued immunity of the Hebrides and of Malta, each famed for\r\nits indigenous race of dogs, for long centuries, during which the\r\nmalady prevailed at frequent intervals on the adjacent mainlands, and\r\nthe continued exemption of South Africa and of the Australasian and\r\nother islands, in the face of the counter-fact that the affection\r\npersisted after importation in the West Indies and South America,\r\nspeak strongly for the doctrine that the introduction of a\r\npre-existing germ is an essential condition of the evolution of the\r\ndisease. The following statistics of cases which entered the Berlin\r\nVeterinary College furnish further corroborative evidence. There\r\nentered the college,\r\n\r\n  In 9 years, 1845-53, inclusive, 278 rabid dogs.\r\n  \"           1854                  4   \"    \"\r\n  \"           1855                  1   \"   dog.\r\n  \"           1856                  1   \"    \"\r\n  \"  5 years, 1857-61, inclusive,   0   \"    \"\r\n\r\nThe average for each of the first nine years was a fraction less than\r\n31. In the two last of the nine the cases rose to 68 and 82, and this\r\nled early in 1854 to an order for the muzzling of all dogs, which was\r\nrigidly enforced by the police. The disease was promptly suppressed,\r\nthe two cases in the two succeeding years being probably due to\r\ninfected kennels or to importation from without. The results in Eldena\r\n(Fuertenberg) and Holland (Van Capelle) are equally conclusive. The\r\ninefficiency of some orders for the muzzling of dogs makes nothing\r\nagainst these facts. A law on the statute-book is not always a law in\r\nforce, as I saw in Alfort and Lyons in 1863; the dogs wore their\r\nmuzzles only in honor of the periodic visits of the commissionnaire of\r\npolice, and rabies prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of competent observers of to-day deny, or at least\r\nstrongly doubt, the occurrence of the disease apart from inoculation.\r\nWithout assuming to decide the question for all times and places, it\r\nmay {891} be safely asserted that there is no sufficient proof of such\r\nan occurrence in any recent time.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. Sâzé, a former student, informed me that boys in\r\nJapan produce what is believed to be canine rabies by administering to\r\ndogs a fungus (bukeryo) found growing on a coniferous tree. The dogs\r\ndo not all seem to die, but are usually killed by way of precaution.\r\nThe symptoms are those of delirium, with a propensity to bite, and the\r\ndisease is assumed to be communicable, though no facts are given to\r\nshow that it is so. This popular fancy has all the air of a popular\r\nfallacy, but as the counterfeit attests the genuine, it shows the\r\nfamiliarity of the Japanese with true rabies.]\r\n\r\nThe contagion of rabies is usually resident in the saliva, but is by\r\nno means confined to that product. Paul Bert found the bronchial mucus\r\nvirulent in dogs in which the saliva was non-virulent. The flesh has\r\nconveyed the disease when eaten, though probably only because of sores\r\nor abrasions on the alimentary tract. Smith records the death of\r\nnegroes in Peru from eating rabid cows;[5] Schenkius, that of persons\r\nwho ate of a rabid pig; and Gohier and Lafosse have infected dogs by\r\nfeeding the flesh of rabid dogs and ruminants; Rossi and Hertwig have\r\nseparately induced rabies by inoculating sound animals with portions\r\nof nerves from rabid ones. No absolute proof can be adduced that the\r\ndisease has been conveyed through consumption of the milk. Cases\r\nquoted to show its virulence are open to the objection that the dam\r\nprobably licked the offspring. A similar uncertainty attaches to the\r\nspermatic fluid. Women are alleged to have acquired hydrophobia by\r\ncoitus, but no such case can be adduced among animals, though rabid\r\nmales have often had connection with healthy females. The alleged\r\ncases in women were therefore probably the result of an excited\r\nimagination or caused by virus introduced through some other channel.\r\nThe breath and perspiration seem incapable of becoming media for the\r\ntransmission of the disease. The blood was supposed to be non-virulent\r\nby Breschet, Majendie, Dupuytren, Blaine, Youatt, etc., but has been\r\nshown by Eckel and Lafosse to be rabific. Eckel successfully\r\ninoculated the blood of a rabid he-goat on a sheep and that of a rabid\r\nman on a dog. Lafosse accomplished the same in one of three attempts\r\nby inoculation from dog to dog. The blood is probably only virulent in\r\nthe advanced stages of the disease, and its virulence implies the\r\nvirulence of all vascular tissues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Peru as it Is_.]\r\n\r\nThe saliva of rabid Herbivora and Omnivora, long held to be harmless,\r\nis now known to be virulent. Berndt has successfully inoculated it\r\nfrom an ox to four sheep; Eckel from a goat to a sheep; Rey from sheep\r\nto sheep; Lessona from an ox to two horses and a sheep; Tombaro from a\r\nheifer to a sheep, a horse, and two dogs; Youatt from horse and ox\r\nrespectively to dogs; Ashburner from an ox to fowls; King from a cow\r\nto fowls; and Majendie, Breschet, Eckel, Hertwig, and Renault from man\r\nto dog; and Earle from man to rabbits. Besides these are a series of\r\naccidental cases, as from horse to man (Youatt), from a sheep to its\r\nshepherd (Tardieu), and from man to man (Aurelianus, Enaux,\r\nChaussier).\r\n\r\nExperiments by Hertwig and Eckel seem to show that saliva loses its\r\nvirulence on the supervention of cadaveric rigidity or putrefaction in\r\nthe dead body. Haubner even believed dried saliva to be innocuous. Yet\r\nCount Salm successfully inoculated the dried saliva of a rabid dog,\r\nand Schenkius reports a case of hydrophobia produced by a scratch of a\r\nhunting-knife that had been used to kill a mad dog some years before.\r\nA veterinary student at Copenhagen cut his finger while dissecting\r\n{892} the body of a rabid dog twelve hours after death, and died of\r\nhydrophobia six weeks later. These cases in man may, it is true, have\r\nresulted from fear, but the same cannot be said of the infection of\r\nhound after hound placed in empty infected kennels, as recorded by\r\nBlaine, Youatt, and others. In the face of this it would require very\r\nstrong negative testimony, indeed, to prove that the virus of rabies\r\nis devitalized in drying--a process which prolongs the vitality of\r\nother virulent matters.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time the germ of rabies has not been demonstrated.\r\nThat it is a particulate living organism may be reasonably deduced\r\nfrom its power of indefinite increase--a quality possessed by no mere\r\nchemical nor mechanical agent, also from the saliva proving\r\nnon-virulent after filtration through plaster, while the solid residue\r\nleft on the filter was virulent (Bert). But, although bacteria have\r\nbeen found in the saliva, those demonstrated up to the present are\r\nmanifestly ordinary aërial bacteria, such as in Pasteur's experiments\r\nproduced septicæmia rather than rabies. It still remains, therefore,\r\nfor some future observer to discover that germ of which we cannot\r\ndoubt the existence.\r\n\r\nThe point of election of this germ appears to be mainly the nervous\r\ntissue. Pasteur found the brain-matter of rabid animals invariably\r\ninfectious, and has preserved the moist brain in an infecting\r\ncondition for three weeks at a temperature of 12° C. He found that by\r\ndirect inoculation in the brain-substance the period of incubation was\r\nabridged, rabies often showing itself in six, eight, or ten days. In\r\nthe face of Rossi's successful inoculation of nerves and Pasteur's\r\nresults with brain-matter it is difficult to account for the\r\nunsuccessful inoculation of nerve-tissue in six successive experiments\r\nby Hertwig. It seems to show that though the virus is concentrated in\r\nthe brain, and especially in the medulla and pons, yet it does not\r\nequally permeate the entire nervous system. This election of the\r\npoison for the nervous tissue led Dr. Douboue in 1851 to advance the\r\ntheory that it is propagated from the seat of inoculation to the brain\r\nthrough the medium of the nerves--a position now assumed by Pasteur.\r\nThis, we fear, is not well founded. The poison, advancing for a month\r\nor more along the lines of the nerves, would probably derange and\r\nabolish their functions, as it does so speedily and effectually that\r\nof the nerve-centres after it has gained a seat in them, whereas, in\r\nreality, the local paralysis only appears in the last stages and after\r\nthe symptoms of cerebral disorder are well established. Furthermore, a\r\ncommon premonitory symptom of rabies is congestion, swelling, and\r\nirritation of the inoculation wound, showing a sudden extraordinary\r\nactivity at that point as a herald, if not a condition, of the general\r\ninfection, whereas under a slow propagation along the nerves from the\r\nfirst this irritation would probably have been greatest in the wound\r\nat the outset, and would have thereafter kept pace with the progress\r\nof the virus along the nerves. Again, the blood is not always\r\ninfecting. Blaine, Youatt, and others of the older observers had no\r\nfear of the blood. Hertwig obtained rabies in two cases only out of\r\neleven inoculations with the blood of rabid subjects. The blood in\r\nthis, as in some other diseases (variola equina, v. ovina, lung plague\r\nof cattle), proves to a certain extent inimical and destructive to the\r\npoison. Galtier inoculated nine sheep and one goat by intravenous\r\ninjection of the saliva of mad dogs, in no case with fatal results nor\r\nindeed with any manifestation of rabies, but with the effect of\r\nfortifying the system so, {893} that subsequent inoculation into the\r\ntissues of the saliva of rabid animals was harmless. Test inoculations\r\nmade in the tissues of other animals with the same virus used in his\r\nintravenous injections, and his subsequent inoculations of the animals\r\nso treated, invariably determined rabies. Pasteur repeated these\r\nintravenous injections in dogs with the result of rapidly inducing\r\nrabies in a fair proportion of cases. One of his cases produced in\r\nthis way recovered, and thenceforward resisted all further inoculation\r\nwith the virus. Others that did not perish from intravenous injection\r\nafterward died of rabies after inoculation in the brain.\r\nUnfortunately, neither Galtier nor Pasteur have reported how much\r\nvirulent saliva was injected in any one case, so that we have no data\r\nas to whether the difference was due to the varying quantity of the\r\nvirus introduced in the various cases. Lussana, an Italian physician,\r\nhad already in 1878 experimented on two dogs by injecting into their\r\nveins the blood of a physician who died of hydrophobia. The blood was\r\ndrawn by leeches and cupping-glasses, and five grammes were injected\r\ninto each dog. One died on the twenty-fourth day, presenting the\r\nsymptoms and post-mortem appearances of rabies. The second at the end\r\nof one hundred and forty days developed symptoms of rabies which\r\nlasted a month, when the animal was sacrificed, and nothing special\r\nfound at the autopsy. The data do not warrant a very positive\r\nconclusion, yet they seem to imply that the receptivity on the part of\r\nthe dog is greater than that of the small ruminants. They suggest,\r\nfurther, a greater relative potency in the battle for life of the\r\nblood-globules of the small ruminants with this unknown rabific germ.\r\nThis antagonism between the blood of the ruminant and the germ of\r\nrabies finds a parallel in the case of other disease-poisons in their\r\nrelations to the nuclei of the tissues. Thus animals may prove\r\nrefractory to a small dose of the poison of anthrax, yet Chauveau has\r\nshown that this virus will overcome all native or acquired\r\ninsusceptibility when administered in excess. The same is true of the\r\npoison of chicken cholera, which Salmon dilutes until it is non-fatal,\r\nthough still affecting the system and conferring an immunity from its\r\nattacks in the future. So with the lymph of variola ovina, which Peuch\r\ndiluted to 1/50 and injected with the effect of producing slight fever\r\nand immunity without vesiculation.\r\n\r\nThis view would imply that in ordinary cases (inoculation with a\r\nmoderate amount of the poison) the virus is for a time localized in\r\nthe vicinity of the wound; and this is further supported by the fact\r\nthat thorough excision and cauterization of the wound some time after\r\nit has been received is still often protective. It is weakened by the\r\nfact that bites of dogs in the stage of incubation sometimes produce\r\nrabies, but it must be borne in mind that there is still a period\r\nbetween the passage of the living germ to the salivary glands and\r\nbrain and the growth of the germ in the nerve-centres, so as to\r\nproduce pathognomonic symptoms, during which both blood and saliva\r\nmust be virulent.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of successful inoculations to the bites is very varied.\r\nThus, out of 555 dogs reported to have been bitten by rabid dogs, 188\r\ncontracted rabies; out of 183 experimentally exposed till bitten or\r\ninoculated, 91 became mad; out of 73 cattle bitten, 45 became rabid;\r\nout of 121 sheep bitten, 51 succumbed; and of 890 persons bitten, 428\r\ntook hydrophobia (48 per cent.). Of 440 bitten by rabid wolves, 291,\r\nor 66 per cent., took the disease. Such statistics are, however, far\r\nfrom satisfactory. Of dogs {894} reported mad, some have only suffered\r\nfrom epilepsy, convulsions, or colic, while of those bitten by the\r\nreally mad dog, some have sustained simple bruises without any real\r\nabrasion; in other cases the teeth have been wiped clean by passing\r\nthrough thick wool, hair, or clothing, or even the flesh of other\r\nanimals just bitten; in other cases the bite has been inflicted at a\r\ntime when the virulence of the saliva was at its minimum, or in a\r\nsubject which was naturally insusceptible. The protective effect of\r\nclothing was well illustrated in a case which came under my notice in\r\nLondon. Six animals bitten by a rabid dog all contracted rabies,\r\nwhilst a man bitten a few hours before through the coat-sleeve, and\r\nwho did not have the wound cauterized for a full hour after the bite,\r\nescaped. Bouley found that in 32 persons bitten in the face, 29 died\r\nof rabies (90 per cent.); of 73 bitten on the hands, 46 died (63 per\r\ncent.); of 28 bitten on the arms, 8 died (28 per cent.); of 24 bitten\r\non the lower limbs, 7 died (29 per cent.); of 19 bitten on the body\r\n(usually multiple wounds), 12 died (63 per cent.). The high mortality\r\nfrom the bites of rabid wolves and skunks is mainly due to this habit\r\nof attacking the face and hands. As illustrative of insusceptibility\r\nmay be quoted the poodle of Hertwig, which was inoculated nine times\r\nwith unquestionably rabic virus without effect; also the pointer of\r\nRey, which was seventeen times bitten by rabid dogs without harm; also\r\nthe acquired immunity of Galtier's sheep and rabbits, above referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nINCUBATION.--In the dog this varies from 6 days (Pasteur) to 240 days\r\n(Bollinger). In the majority of cases it ends in from 20 to 50 days.\r\nPasteur, by inoculating into the brain substance direct, reduced the\r\nincubation from 20 days to 6 days. In the horse the limits of reported\r\ncases are from 15 days to 92 days. In the ox incubation varies from 20\r\nto 30 days; in sheep, from 20 to 74 days; and in swine, from 20 to 49\r\ndays in recorded cases.\r\n\r\nIn man incubation is believed to be often much more prolonged. In 6\r\nper cent. of all cases it is from 3 to 18 days; in 60 per cent., from\r\n18 to 64 days; and in 34 per cent. it exceeds 64 days (Hamilton,\r\nThamhayn). Quite frequently symptoms of hydrophobia appear from three\r\nto six months after the bite; in a few the period is prolonged to one\r\nor two years, and in rare instances to seven (Schule), and even twelve\r\nyears (Chabert). But all such cases of prolonged incubation in man are\r\nat the least extremely doubtful. Man often contracts a\r\npseudo-hydrophobia as the result of fear, and is curable by moral\r\nsuasion alone; and as no such protracted incubations are noticed in\r\nthe lower animals, and as no one of these abnormally deferred attacks\r\nin man has been verified by successful inoculation on animals, it is\r\nprudent to reserve a full assent until they are supported by better\r\ntestimony. A specimen of such cases is that recorded by Chirac, in\r\nwhich a cadet bitten at Montpellier afterward spent ten years in\r\nHolland, and then, returning and hearing that his fellow-cadet bitten\r\nby the same dog had died of hydrophobia, he also manifested the\r\ndisease and died. Another is the case of a man who, after having been\r\nbitten, spent two years in prison, and then developed hydrophobia and\r\ndied. A mind naturally erratic and rendered weaker and more\r\nsusceptible by prolonged confinement would prey upon itself and\r\nexaggerate the danger when the subject had been forcibly presented. In\r\nall such cases the attending physician should feel bound in the\r\ninterests of humanity to {895} inoculate a dog or other animal and\r\nascertain whether or not the disease is virulent. The value of such\r\nresults in dealing with future cases of the same kind cannot be\r\noverestimated.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation appears to be relatively shorter in the young\r\n(average 45 days) than the old (average 70 days), and is believed to\r\nbe shortened by constitutional excitement from violent passion, fever,\r\nthe heat of the weather, or electrical disturbances.\r\n\r\nDuring incubation no sign of the disease can be detected; it is even\r\nsaid that the wounds heal with unusual rapidity; but it is certain\r\nthat toward the end of the latency the cicatrix, alike in man and\r\nanimals, tends to become sensitive, itchy, congested, and even the\r\nseat of papular eruptions. The vesicles (lyssi) which, according to\r\nXanthos, Marochetti, and Magistel, appear near the opening of the\r\nsublingual glands within a few days (6 to 20) after inoculation, have\r\nnot been found by any recent observer.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Three forms of rabies in the dog are recognized--the\r\nfurious, the paralytic, and the lethargic. The prodromata are,\r\nhowever, the same in all, so that these may be conveniently considered\r\nbefore the different types are noticed.\r\n\r\nThe premonitory symptoms are by far the most important, as if these\r\nare recognized the dog may be safely secluded or destroyed before\r\nthere is any disposition to bite. Any sudden change in a dog's habits\r\nor instincts is ground for suspicion. Bouley well says that a sick dog\r\nis always to be suspected. In some cases there is unusual dulness and\r\napathy, in others great restlessness, watchfulness, and nervousness. A\r\nmorbid appetite, in house-dogs a tendency to pick up and swallow\r\nstraws, thread, paper, pins, and other objects, or to devour their own\r\ndung and urine, is highly characteristic. A desire to lick cold smooth\r\nobjects, as a stone, a boot, a piece of metal, or the nose of another\r\ndog, is often seen. Smelling and licking the anus or generative organs\r\nof another dog and the exhibition of sexual desire are frequent\r\nmanifestations. An increased fondness for the owner, shown by fawning\r\nand licking, is occasionally seen, though more commonly there is a\r\nchange from a formerly amiable temper to a morose, sullen, retiring,\r\nand resentful disposition. If a naturally quiet dog flies into a\r\nviolent passion at the sight of another dog or a cat, and attempts to\r\nbite it, he should be carefully watched. If a social dog seeks\r\nseclusion and darkness, or if while crouching and shrinking from a\r\nblow (hyperæsthesia) he yet bears it without howl or whine, he is to\r\nbe strongly suspected. Barking without object, constant moving,\r\nsearching, and scraping, a disposition to tear wood, clothing, etc. to\r\npieces, and, above all, an absence from home for a day or two, should\r\nbeget grave apprehensions. The rabid bark or howl which is often heard\r\nearly in the disease is hoarse, low, and muffled, partaking of the\r\nnature of both bark and howl, the first running into the second, and\r\nconsists of one loud howl followed by three or four others\r\nprogressively diminished in force and uttered without closing the\r\nmouth. Some rub the chaps with the forepaws as if to dislodge an\r\noffending body from the mouth; others reject bloody matter by\r\nvomiting; and others turn the head and eyes as if following imaginary\r\nobjects, and snap at them. Finally, a tendency to bite, rub, or gnaw\r\nthe wound is significant, and usually draws attention to the fact that\r\nthe wound, long healed, is still red, sensitive, and swollen, {896} or\r\neven papular. The conjunctivæ are usually congested, there is an\r\nincreased nasal defluxion, and the skin of the forehead and over the\r\neyes is drawn into wrinkles. This stage lasts from a half to two or\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nFollowing one or more of the above symptoms, paroxysms of wicked fury\r\ncome on, alternating still with periods of quiet, in which prodromata\r\nonly are observed. The red congested eyes assume a fixed stare, often\r\nsquint or roll as if following an imaginary object, at which the dog\r\npresently snaps. A paroxysm is ushered in by increasing uneasiness,\r\nfrequent change of position, and a desire to escape, shown in rushing\r\nat the door, tugging at the chain, or gnawing the post and walls of\r\nthe kennel. The tendency to bite and gnaw is further shown by seizing\r\nthe straw or tearing to pieces wooden and other articles within reach,\r\nor even by the victim lacerating its own body.\r\n\r\nThe rabid howl becomes more frequent, and the rage and disposition to\r\nbite strange animals and persons merge into a mischievous desire to\r\nworry all that come in the way, the respect for former companions and\r\nfriends being steadily lost as the paroxysm increases in violence. Yet\r\nfor a considerable time the voice of a loved master recalls the\r\nsuffering animal to some degree of self-control. If free to escape\r\nduring such paroxysms, the dog expends his excitement in wandering,\r\nmaking long journeys of five, ten, or twenty miles, and flying at\r\nevery animal or man he meets, especially if they increase his\r\nexcitement by any noise or outcry. If the victim escapes destruction\r\nduring one of these wanderings, he returns during a lucid interval\r\nexceedingly dangerous, for, though he may recognize or even fawn upon\r\nhis friends, yet the demon of mischief is even more potent within him,\r\nand may be roused to sudden violence by any noise or excitement. The\r\nintervals of quiet are attended by a prostration proportionate to the\r\nviolence of the previous paroxysm, and the animal usually seeks\r\nseclusion and darkness, where he may lie dull and torpid, but he may\r\nbe roused at any time to a renewed paroxysm by any noise, disturbance,\r\nthe presentation of a stick, or, above all, by the approach of another\r\nanimal. During the paroxysm the animal is manifestly the subject of\r\nacute delirium, has hallucinations, snatches and bites at unreal\r\nobjects, turns on his best friends, even his master, seizes and holds\r\non to a stick or iron bar until the teeth are detached and the gums\r\nlacerated, bites his own body, even amputating tail, testicles, or\r\ntoes with his teeth; a bitch deserts her puppies or worries them, and\r\nall follow the unconquerable impulse to wander and to wound living\r\nbeings. The victim will sometimes manifest incredible strength in\r\nbreaking his chain and scaling high walls. Twitchings of the muscles\r\nof the face, and even general convulsions, are sometimes seen. Food is\r\nusually rejected, or if swallowed is soon vomited. In the course of\r\ntwo or three days the furious stage merges into the paralytic one,\r\nfirst shown by paresis of the hind extremities and a swaying motion in\r\nwalking, then by paralysis of the lower jaw, which hangs pendent and\r\nallows the escape of a viscid saliva. The palsy gradually extends over\r\nthe whole body--a sure precursor of approaching death, which is rarely\r\ndelayed beyond eight days, and never more than ten, from the onset. In\r\nthis last stage the animal has become extremely emaciated, with dry\r\nwithered hair, hollow flanks, and small weak pulse; he may at first\r\nrise on his fore limbs when {897} disturbed, and even attempt to snap,\r\nbut there is now little danger of a bite. Convulsions may alternate\r\nwith the paralysis. The result is invariably fatal.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of dumb or paralytic rabies in dogs is that the last\r\nor paralytic stage supervenes at once on the prodromata, without any\r\nintervening period of acute delirium and fury. The animal is\r\nthroughout dull, quiet, and depressed, and shows little tendency to\r\nbite, to wander, or to restless movement. The excitement of the sexual\r\npassion is the same as in the furious forms, and the howl is still\r\nemitted, though much more rarely. Soon the lower jaw drops from\r\nparalysis, allowing the saliva to drivel from the mouth, and the\r\nanimal can only succeed in closing it momentarily under the greatest\r\nprovocation to bite. Paralysis of the hind limbs and of the whole body\r\nspeedily follows, and death ensues in from two to three days. As soon\r\nas the jaw is paralyzed the subject is unable to drink, eat, bite, or\r\nbark, and emaciation advances with extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe lethargic or tranquil form of rabies in dogs is manifested neither\r\nby furious madness nor by palsy of the jaws, but the nervous\r\nprostration is shown in a profound lethargy and apathy. The patient\r\ncurls himself up, and will not be roused by his master's voice, by any\r\nnoise, disturbance, or even punishment; he makes no response to the\r\ncaresses of his friends, and pays no attention to the food or drink\r\nthey bring him, but remains in his place, growing daily more emaciated\r\nand lethargic, until relieved by death toward the tenth or fifteenth\r\nday of the illness.\r\n\r\nBesides the three typical forms there are intermediate varieties,\r\nwhich are classed with one or other according as the symptoms of that\r\ntype seem to predominate. The same virus, inoculated, will produce\r\ndifferent types in separate individuals, the result seeming to depend\r\nmore on the susceptibility of the subject than any special quality in\r\nthe poison. With many notable exceptions it may be stated that, on the\r\nwhole, furious rabies predominates in hounds, bull-dogs, and other\r\nless domesticated or naturally vicious and courageous breeds, while\r\nthe paralytic and tranquil types attack especially house and pet dogs.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR FALLACIES.--It is a dangerous delusion to suppose that mad\r\ndogs have a dread of water and polished surfaces, that they will not\r\neat or drink, that they froth abundantly from the mouth, and that they\r\nrun with the tail drooping between the hind limbs. There is no\r\nhydrophobia in the dog or other domestic animal. The rabid dog drinks\r\nfreely in the early stages of the disease, lapping even his own urine;\r\nlater, he still laps, and even plunges his nose in water, though often\r\nunable to swallow; and in his wanderings he swims rivers without the\r\nslightest reluctance. The appetite is not entirely lost, though\r\ngreatly impaired and usually depraved, all sorts of unsuitable,\r\nnoxious, and disgusting objects being picked up and swallowed with\r\navidity. Frothing from the mouth is exceptional in rabies, and the\r\nflow of saliva is rarely seen unless when the jaw is paralyzed and\r\npendent. Carrying the tail between the legs is a symptom of all\r\ndiseases attended by abdominal pain, and is by no means constant in\r\nrabies. During the paroxysms the tail is usually carried erect.\r\n\r\nFoxes, jackals, and badgers attacked by rabies lose their natural\r\n{898} shyness, enter villages, follow and bite other animals and men,\r\nand, like rabid dogs, die in an unconscious and paralytic condition.\r\nWolves are affected like foxes, but are more dangerous because of\r\ntheir power, the ferocity of their attack, and their habit of flying\r\nat the face and hands. Rabid cats are more retiring than dogs, and\r\nshow less disposition to attack, but when they do, use both claws and\r\nteeth, and especially on bare portions of the body. The cry is hoarse\r\nlike that emitted during the period of rut. They usually die about the\r\nthird or fourth day.\r\n\r\nThe rabid horse is the subject of violent excitement, nervousness, and\r\nfear. There are trembling, loss of appetite, rubbing and eversion of\r\nthe upper lip, neighing, sexual excitement, and inclination to bite\r\nand kick. Delirium may be suspected, but during the paroxysms the true\r\nnature of the disease is betrayed by the unconquerable desire to bite,\r\nkick, and otherwise injure those about him. He will even gnaw the\r\nmanger and kick the stall to pieces, or lacerate his fore limbs and\r\nflanks with his teeth. In the early stages there is the same tendency\r\nto lick and rub the wound, which becomes red and irritable, the same\r\nred glaring or squinting eyes, and the same jerking of the muscles, as\r\nseen in the dog, and the affection winds up in the same way, in\r\nparalysis and death in four or five days.\r\n\r\nRabid cattle lose appetite, become very restless and excitable, grind\r\nthe teeth, lick the cicatrix, evert the upper lip, and otherwise show\r\nsexual excitement, bellow often in a loud, terrified manner, as if\r\nstill apprehensive of the attack of the dog, paw and scrape the ground\r\nwith the fore feet, butt and kick viciously, have twitching of the\r\nmuscles, and finally paralysis and death in from four to seven days.\r\nWhen paralysis is coming on the hind feet are often drawn forward as\r\nin inflammation of the feet. The pulse and breathing are accelerated\r\nduring the paroxysms, but I have not found the temperature raised.\r\n\r\nRabid sheep and goats present the same general symptoms, bleat\r\nhoarsely, but viciously, have sexual excitement, nibble the cicatrix,\r\nhave muscular weakness, emaciation, and paralysis, and die in from\r\nfive to eight days.\r\n\r\nRabid swine show much fear, restlessness, and excitability, hide under\r\nthe litter, start violently at noises, grunt hoarsely, champ the jaws,\r\nshow a great disposition to bite and to gnaw and tear objects to\r\npieces, have dark red, glaring eyes, gape and yawn, and become weak\r\nand paralytic. Breathing is often labored, and the mucosæ and white\r\nskin assume a dull red or leaden hue. Death ensues as early as the\r\nfourth or fifth day.\r\n\r\nIn Herbivora and Omnivora a paroxysm is usually induced by the sight\r\nof a dog--a fact of importance in diagnosis.\r\n\r\nRabid skunks have naturally received but little study. They tend,\r\nhowever, to steal up to men and animals and bite some exposed part of\r\nthe body, like the finger, ear, or nose, and as stealthily retire. It\r\nis claimed that their odorous secretion is suppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Hydrophobia in Man.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the prodromata are altogether omitted, the disease\r\nsetting in suddenly with spasms of the pharynx and inability to\r\nswallow. More commonly, the premonitory symptoms last from one to\r\nthree days. The first symptom is often an itching, prickling, or more\r\nor less violent {899} aching in the seat of the bite, and even of an\r\naura, a numbness, or shooting pain extending from that point toward\r\nthe heart. In such cases the wound is red or bluish, and even swollen.\r\nIn other cases there is chilliness, a general feeling of headache,\r\nmalaise, and prostration, with lack of appetite or nausea, gloomy\r\nforebodings, taciturnity, nervous excitability, and restlessness. That\r\nrestlessness which in patients cognizant of the consequence of the\r\nbite often induces insomnia during incubation, now often shows itself\r\nin an inability to keep quiet or to remain in one position or\r\nplace--the exact counterpart of the initial restless stage shown in\r\nthe canine patient. The sleep is now even more broken and unrefreshing\r\nand disturbed by fearful dreams. The restlessness soon merges into\r\nintense nervous irritability. Though devoured by thirst, the patient\r\nis afraid of water, and the attempt to drink will cause slight spasms\r\nwith a sensation of filling of the throat and difficulty of\r\ndeglutition. Even the air blowing upon his surface produces nervous\r\nirritation and apprehension, and a sudden glare of sunshine or other\r\nstrong light is still more injurious. The pulse is increased in\r\nfrequency, hard, and small; the breathing accelerated, oppressed, with\r\nat times yawning, sighing, or sobbing; there is some redness of the\r\nfauces, vascular injection of face and eyes, with, in some cases,\r\ndilated pupils; nausea or oppression at the epigastrium, sometimes\r\nvomiting; and usually constipation, which cannot, as in dogs, be\r\nreferred to the earth, sand, and unsuitable materials swallowed.\r\nIntelligence is unimpaired.\r\n\r\nWith or without some or all of the premonitory symptoms above\r\ndescribed the patient is sooner or later seized with constrictive\r\nspasms of the pharynx and respiratory muscles, the immediate occasion\r\nbeing an attempt to swallow liquid or some sudden fright or\r\nexcitement. So great is the agony produced by this attack that, though\r\nconsumed by thirst, the patient will rarely afterward attempt to\r\ndrink, and the mere sight or offer of water, the noise of liquid\r\nflowing from one vessel to another, or even the sight of the vessel in\r\nwhich liquid was contained, suffices to bring on a violent paroxysm.\r\nThis hydrophobia is peculiar to the human being suffering from this\r\ndisease, being rarely seen in rabid animals; and it serves to\r\nenormously enhance the agony and horror of the affection. During a\r\nparoxysm the dyspnoea is usually extreme; there is a gasping or\r\nsighing respiration, and shrill, inarticulate sounds or screams are\r\nemitted which have been likened to the bark of a dog. These are\r\nmanifestly due to the threatened suffocation rather than to an attempt\r\nto bark. The sensations have been described as a rising of the stomach\r\ninto the throat, while others felt as if the throat had turned into\r\nbone and could not admit nor pass on the liquid. The abdominal\r\ncontractions are often well marked, and retching and vomiting ensue.\r\nThis reflex irritability of the nerves of deglutition and respiration\r\nis followed or attended by a condition of the most intense\r\nhyperæsthesia and a great exaltation of the special senses. A deaf and\r\ndumb child is said to have heard distinctly at this stage. There are,\r\nbesides, during a paroxysm, general muscular trembling and clonic\r\nspasms of the muscles of the trunk and extremities. The facial muscles\r\nare contracted, the nostrils dilated, the face and eyes red and\r\ninjected, and the pupils dilated, producing a spectacle of the most\r\nintense agony. Even in the intervals the hyperæsthesia is so extreme\r\nthat the slightest touch of an attendant, a {900} current of air, the\r\napproach of a candle, or even the ordinary tones of conversation,\r\nproduce extreme agitation and may precipitate a violent convulsive\r\nparoxysm. The duration of the paroxysms and of the intervals varies\r\nmuch, but in general terms the former increase rapidly in number and\r\nseverity, while the latter are correspondingly shortened. Restraint\r\nserves to aggravate the paroxysm, while, according to Hunter, the\r\nearlier and lighter ones may be relieved by running. The intense\r\nexcitement sometimes becomes manifest in the persistent talking, and\r\nit is noticeable that the patient is free from mental delusions. As it\r\nis impossible to swallow, the patient spits out the now viscid saliva\r\non all sides--a feature, like the fear of water, peculiar to man. As\r\nthe disease advances the paroxysms are marked by the most perfect\r\nhallucinations and delirium, which impel the victim to acts of insane\r\nviolence toward every one and every thing about him. In these fits he\r\nwill use every available means of offence, even to the snapping of the\r\njaws, though on the subsidence of the fit he will often express the\r\ngreatest regret and warn his victims to be on their guard when he\r\nfinds another paroxysm coming on. In some few instances the delusions\r\ncontinue even during the remissions, and the patient remains possessed\r\nof a sense of suspicion and horror of all about him, and yet the fear\r\nof being left alone is usually greater still. The convulsions may\r\nbecome tetanic (as opisthotonos). They are habitually more severe in\r\nmen than in women and children. During a convulsion the victim will at\r\ntimes become black in the face, and may die from suffocation,\r\napoplexy, or nervous exhaustion.\r\n\r\nShould he survive this danger the final paralytic stage sets in. The\r\nspasms gradually become weaker, reflex irritability is lessened, and a\r\nperiod of quiet, and even comparative composure, may ensue, during\r\nwhich the former sights and sounds fail to produce a paroxysm, and\r\nsome patients even recover the power of deglutition; but muscular\r\nweakness and prostration become more extreme, the lower jaw may even\r\ndrop, and the viscid saliva drivel from the lips; finally, stupor\r\nsupervenes, and the patient dies in a state of profound coma or\r\ncomplete exhaustion. This last stage lasts from one to eighteen hours.\r\n\r\nCases are met with in the human subject, as in the dog, in which the\r\nparoxysmal stage is omitted in greater part or entirely. The patient\r\ncomplains only of oppressed breathing, and sighs deeply when he\r\nattempts to swallow, and paroxysms, if they occur at all, are very\r\nmild. Decroix indeed claims that if a person suffering from\r\nhydrophobia is kept in a dark room and perfectly quiet, no paroxysms\r\nappear. The malady is, however, none the less fatal.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of rabies and hydrophobia is not usually\r\ndifficult if the disease has progressed to its paroxysmal stage. The\r\nmost pathognomonic features are the fact of a bite by a rabid animal\r\nand the evidence of lesions and an extraordinary irritability of the\r\nmedulla oblongata, inducing severe reflex spasms of the muscles of\r\ndeglutition and respiration under the influence of any peripheral\r\nirritation. The clonic nature of the spasms and the entire absence of\r\ntrismus serve to distinguish it from tetanus. From pharyngeal anthrax\r\nand diphtheria attended with spasm it is diagnosed by the extreme\r\nexaltation of the special senses and the absence of any marked febrile\r\nreaction; from acute mania by the difficulty of breathing and\r\ndeglutition, the more rapid heart-beats during {901} a paroxysm, and\r\nby the marked hyperæsthesia and exalted reflex susceptibility, as well\r\nas by the perfectly lucid intermissions; and from epilepsy, in that\r\nthe latter is not associated with the same hyperæsthesia, that the\r\nparoxysm is not developed by noise, movement, attempts to swallow,\r\nsight of water, etc., that the spasms are more universal, and that\r\nthey do not recur often, nor can they be roused by the causes\r\nimmediately producing those of hydrophobia. Hysterical cases can\r\nusually be recognized by the imperfection of the symptoms; the\r\nsubject, not knowing all the manifestations of hydrophobia, naturally\r\nfails to produce them.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult to distinguish from the genuine disease are those\r\ncases in which hydrophobia occurs as a disease of the imagination, the\r\nresult of fear--the lyssophobia or hydrophobie non-rabique of the\r\nwriters. In these there is always the history of a bite; the cicatrix\r\neven may have become the seat of congestive redness, itching, or\r\nneuralgic pains, and these, acting on a susceptible brain, develop a\r\ndisease which is hardly distinguishable from true hydrophobia, and\r\nwhich is quite as fatal if left to run its course. These cases have\r\nusually less reflex susceptibility than genuine hydrophobia; the\r\nattack mostly occurs shortly after some conversation on the subject,\r\nand especially about the effects of the bites on others; and the\r\nvictim is seen to have a nervous organization, and may even be known\r\nto have been subject to hysteria or other nervous disorder. At the\r\nsame time, the concentration of the mind on this subject sometimes\r\nproduces even structural changes in the medulla, and the reflex\r\nsusceptibility in co-ordination with the other symptoms may be almost\r\nperfect. In a case reported a few years ago by Hammond the symptoms\r\nappeared perfectly characteristic, and at the necropsy circumscribed\r\npoints of congestion were found near the roots of the vagus; yet the\r\ndog that bit this man was said to be alive and well, and in the\r\nabsence of any successful inoculation from biter or bitten the case\r\nmust be presumed to have been lyssophobia.\r\n\r\nMany cases with a more favorable issue are recorded. Bellenger had a\r\npatient who had been bitten by his cat, and manifested violent\r\nparoxysms of hydrophobia, but was instantly cured by the sight of the\r\nanimal in good health. Bouardel records that a man was bitten by his\r\ndog, which afterward disappeared. He was seized with severe\r\nhydrophobia, which continued for two days, when the lost dog was found\r\nand presented to him, and the symptoms disappeared. Trousseau speaks\r\nof a magistrate whose hand had been licked by his hound, which\r\nimmediately after attacked a flock of sheep, so that many of them died\r\nof rabies. The master then manifested hydrophobia, but as death was\r\ndeferred beyond the usual time, he concluded it was not genuine and\r\nrecovered. Prof. Dick was called to visit a man who had been bitten by\r\na favorite dog while suffering from distemper, had manifested severe\r\nhydrophobic symptoms, and had been given up by the attending\r\nphysicians. He succeeded in convincing the subject that as the dog had\r\nhad distemper, and as no two great diseases could coexist in the same\r\nsystem, it could not have had rabies. In spite of the false premises,\r\nthis reasoning had the desired effect and the patient recovered. A few\r\nyears ago a boy twelve years old in Ithaca, N.Y., was bitten by a dog\r\nsupposed to be rabid, and in due time manifested hydrophobia, which\r\nadvanced rapidly until he was having a violent paroxysm every half\r\nhour, and it was pronounced impossible for him to survive another day.\r\nAt this time I saw him, observed that he {902} had a nervous\r\norganization, and was somewhat lacking in the hyperæsthesia of rabies,\r\nlearned that he had recently been gorging himself with Christmas\r\ndelicacies, and was now very costive; and, as there was no\r\nsatisfactory history of the dog, I at once suspected lyssophobia. The\r\nfriends and strangers who had come to condole with the parents and\r\nfeast on the horror were excluded, and the boy's attention fully\r\nengaged in amusing pictures and conversation; the paroxysms were\r\nomitted, and in two hours the patient, overcome by weariness, went to\r\nsleep. Next morning he was still kept secluded and quiet, and two\r\nenthusiastic students took up the rôle of keeping his attention\r\nconstantly engaged on whatever would interest him. The prima viæ was\r\nrelieved by medicine, and under a course of tonics the boy quickly\r\nrecruited, and at the end of a week went back to school.\r\n\r\nIn doubtful cases the test by inoculation may be tried. Inoculation\r\nwith the saliva of a man suffering from hydrophobia is manifestly\r\nuseless, since he must die before we can hope for the development of\r\nthe disease. But in the case of a dog having bitten one or more people\r\nthe inoculation of the virus on the brain of one or two other dogs\r\nwould ensure the development of the affection in the course of one or\r\ntwo weeks, provided the first was rabid. The non-success of this\r\noperation when practised on two dogs would provide the best possible\r\nmedicine for the diseased mind of the person bitten.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Post-mortem lesions are rather remarkable for\r\ntheir inconstancy than for their specific characters. Hardly a single\r\nlesion can be specified which may not be absent in particular cases,\r\nyet some are so characteristic that, when taken along with the\r\nsymptoms during life, they very materially assist in diagnosing the\r\ndisease. Of the pathological appearances common to man, dog, and other\r\nanimals the following may be named: The body is greatly emaciated; the\r\nrigor mortis is normal or nearly so; decomposition usually sets in\r\nearly; a white skin is livid, cyanotic, or petechial; the cicatrix is\r\noften hardly noticeable even after the animal has been shaved; the\r\nsuperficial veins, especially those of the neck and head, are filled\r\nwith black inspissated blood; the external mucous membranes are of a\r\ndark livid hue, those of the mouth and nose being covered by a\r\ntenacious mucous or muco-purulent secretion (in dogs they are usually\r\ncovered with earth or dust); the fauces, pharynx, and tonsils are\r\nusually of a dark livid hue, and sometimes swollen; in other cases the\r\ndark red hue and manifest swelling that obtained during life disappear\r\nafter death; similar lesions are found in the larynx, and I have seen\r\nextensive erosions; the bronchial mucous membrane is reddened and\r\ncoated with a muco-purulent secretion (and in dogs with earth and\r\nforeign bodies); the lungs are usually congested, often to the extent\r\nof showing death by asphyxia; the heart and large blood-vessels are\r\nfilled with a black thick, venous blood, and the muscles, charged with\r\nthe same blood, have a dark reddish-brown hue; the stomach is usually\r\ncongested, sometimes to a port-wine hue, and is the seat of\r\nblood-extravasations and even erosions; this congestion is often\r\npresent, though to a less degree, in the intestines; the mesenteric\r\nglands and those in the vicinity of the pharynx are not unfrequently\r\nenlarged and congested; a very constant feature is the entire absence\r\nof proper food in the stomach and of chyme in the small intestine; the\r\nliver is usually hyperæmic, {903} exuding on pressure the\r\ncharacteristic dark blood, and it may be the seat of some granular\r\ndegeneration, but it usually retains its normal consistency; the\r\nspleen is normal; the kidneys are hyperæmic and leaden or bluish gray,\r\nand slightly cloudy on the surface (in dogs fatty degeneration of the\r\ninner cortical layer is common even in health); the urinary bladder is\r\nusually empty or contains a little turbid, yellowish, slightly\r\nalbuminous urine, while the mucous membrane is often covered with dark\r\nreddish-brown petechial spots; the brain is usually hyperæmic, and,\r\ntogether with its membranes, slightly oedematous, yet the lesions are\r\nnot constant either in kind or degree; the medulla oblongata usually\r\nshows a similar condition, and even minute points of acute congestion,\r\nbut neither these nor the hyperæmia and oedema of the spinal cord can\r\nbe found in every case.\r\n\r\nSome conditions are especially pathognomonic in the dog. In nearly all\r\ncases of furious rabies the stomach is gorged with foreign bodies,\r\nsuch as hay, straw, wood, coal, leather, portions of textile fabrics,\r\nfæces, earth, sand, stones, pieces of iron, lead, etc., and the same\r\nmaterials are usually found in the small intestine, while the large\r\nintestines are empty. Portions of these foreign bodies are often found\r\nin the bronchia as well, giving rise to circumscribed lobular\r\npneumonia. The significance of such matters when found in large amount\r\nin the stomach of a dog which has been given to biting or other\r\nsymptom of rabies is very great, and if the stomach contains none of\r\nthe natural food of the animal and the duodenum no chyme, it may be\r\nheld pathognomonic of rabies. If, however, the materials are small in\r\nquantity and mingled with natural food, and if the duodenum contains\r\nchyme, the dog was probably not rabid. Dogs frequently chew and\r\nswallow fresh leaves of grass, and those in detention gnaw and swallow\r\npieces of wood, cloth, horn, etc.; but these are used either as an\r\nemetic or a teething-ring, and virtually imply that digestion is not\r\nentirely abolished. Their presence, therefore, along with food does\r\nnot indicate rabies.\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS.--In view of the almost or quite constantly fatal issue of\r\nrabies in man and animals, the main attention should be given to the\r\nquestion of prevention. As the disease is perhaps never in our time\r\ndeveloped except as the result of contagion, we have the most perfect\r\nguarantee that by suitably devised measures it may be absolutely\r\nsuppressed and excluded from any country. Even if we allow that a rare\r\ncase is at long intervals developed spontaneously, it is none the less\r\ncertain that the disease can be practically abolished, as nothing can\r\nbe easier than to nip the disease in the bud in the locality where it\r\nfirst shows itself. Thus in Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand\r\nrabies has not yet appeared, though prevailing in the same latitude\r\nand climate in both hemispheres. It reached Mauritius in 1813, and has\r\nprevailed uninterruptedly since, while in Bourbon, immediately\r\nadjacent and almost identical in geology, climate, flora, and fauna,\r\nit is still unknown. The same truth is told in the entire extinction\r\nof rabies in Berlin by the universal muzzling of dogs, as recorded\r\nabove. The immunity lasted for nine years, during which muzzling was\r\nenforced. A more recent example of the same kind is found in Holland.\r\nIn 1875 universal muzzling was made obligatory in all communes where\r\nrabid animals had been and in adjoining communes. From 1877 on the\r\ndisease was unknown save on the borders of {904} Belgium and Prussia\r\nand in a very few dogs recently imported. Nearly all cases of\r\nhydrophobia in man and animals being due to bites by rabid members of\r\nthe canine fraternity, a fundamental condition of all success in\r\nprevention is the prohibition of its diffusion by dogs. For this\r\nreason the following measures are requisite: 1st. All dogs should be\r\nregistered and heavily taxed. The number of useless dogs kept in every\r\ncommunity affords the greatest opportunity for the speedy diffusion of\r\nthe rabid germ whenever that has been introduced. Whatever tends to\r\nreduce this number directly tends to the restriction and extinction of\r\nrabies. 2d. Every dog should be made to wear a collar with plate\r\nbearing the name and residence of his owner. All stray dogs without\r\nsuch badge should be summarily shot by the police. This will secure\r\nthe payment of the taxes and the destruction of superfluous and\r\ndangerous dogs. 3d. In all cities and counties where rabies has\r\nexisted within a year, and in the counties adjoining them, every dog\r\nshould be muzzled except when securely shut up or tied. All dogs found\r\nat large without a muzzle should be promptly shot by the police. The\r\nobjection to muzzles is satisfactorily met by the use of the wire\r\nmuzzle, which impedes neither breathing nor drinking. 4th. Dogs and\r\ncats suspected or known to have been bitten by rabid animals should be\r\nat once destroyed, or if considered sufficiently valuable may be\r\nconfined in a secure cage for six months under veterinary supervision.\r\n5th. Dogs which have bitten and are supposed to be rabid should be\r\nsimilarly caged and placed under veterinary supervision. If rabid, the\r\nsymptoms will be fully developed in a few days, whereas if destroyed\r\nat once the bitten party is liable to develop lyssophobia. 6th. Dogs\r\nimported from countries where hydrophobia is known to exist should be\r\nsubjected to a period of quarantine of six months. 7th. Foxes, wolves,\r\nbadgers, martens, skunks, must be indiscriminately destroyed in\r\nlocalities where they have become infected with rabies. 8th. The\r\ndisinfection or burning of the kennels where rabid dogs have been is a\r\nnatural corollary of the above.\r\n\r\nOther measures less thorough and efficient are often advocated and\r\nresorted to, but should be discarded whenever it is possible to\r\npractise a method of absolute extermination. Among these may be named\r\nthe flattening of the teeth, and especially of the canines, with a\r\nfile, as advocated by Bourrel, and later by Fleming. While this is a\r\nmeasure of protection, it does not remove the desire to bite, nor the\r\npower of wounding the skin when that is delicate or tender. Another\r\nmethod is to hang a block of wood from the neck, so that it may impede\r\nthe movements of the forelegs and prevent a rush and sudden attack.\r\nThe futility of such a resort need hardly be remarked upon. The\r\nemasculation of dogs is another preventive measure advocated. The\r\nsingle advantage of this is that it does away with the host of suitors\r\nthat follow a rutting bitch, and the mutual worrying and biting that\r\nensue. But it is not yet proved that the disease is produced by\r\nprivation of the generative act, while if it were it is still certain\r\nthat cases of spontaneous rabies are extremely rare; that the rabid\r\ndog bites the castrated one as readily as the perfect male; that the\r\nemasculated one contracts rabies as readily as others when bitten, and\r\nthat he communicates it no less persistently. Galtier's method of\r\nintravenous injection of the rabic saliva, which seems to have proved\r\neffectual in sheep and rabbits, utterly failed in the hands of Lussana\r\nand {905} Pasteur in dogs. Besides this objection, that it is useless\r\nfor the animal which is beyond all comparison the main propagator of\r\nrabies, it has the serious disadvantages that its practice would\r\nnecessitate the maintenance of a constant succession of cases of\r\nrabies, that great danger attends this production and handling of the\r\nvirus, and the expense and risk of a general application of the\r\nmeasure must absolutely forbid it.\r\n\r\nMore recently Pasteur has found that the virus when transmitted\r\nthrough several monkeys in succession becomes so weak as to be\r\nharmless to the animal inoculated, and yet protects the animal against\r\nthe more virulent poison. This fact he utilizes by inoculating this\r\nmitigated ape-virus on the brain of the animal just bitten, so as to\r\nrender that refractory to the disease when the poison from the bitten\r\nwound shall reach it by its ordinary slow channel. At the time of\r\nwriting, the method is being attempted on a man bitten by a mad dog.\r\n\r\nAnother precautionary measure which is always in place is the\r\ndiffusion among dog-owners of correct information as to the\r\npremonitory symptoms of rabies, and the necessity for careful\r\nseclusion when any such symptoms are manifested.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF BITES.--The treatment of bites by animals supposed to be\r\nrabid consists mainly in seeking the elimination of the poison or its\r\ndestruction by caustic. The first object should be to prevent\r\nabsorption of the poison. If the bite has been on a limb, a tourniquet\r\nshould be instantly placed above it. A stout cord or handkerchief is\r\nalways at hand, and may be tied around the limb and twisted with a\r\npiece of wood until circulation is arrested. Sucking the wound is\r\nusually effective in withdrawing the poison, and can convey no\r\nadditional danger to the person bitten. If the patient cannot reach\r\nthe wound with his own mouth, another may volunteer to suck it, though\r\nin these days of diseased teeth and gums the act is pregnant of\r\ndanger. This may be largely obviated by alternately sucking and\r\nrinsing the mouth with a solution of carbolic acid, or, better, by\r\napplying such a solution to the wound before sucking, or finally by\r\nsucking through a tube. Cupping over the wound is highly commendable,\r\nthough less effective than sucking. When cupping can be combined with\r\nwringing of the wound, there is an approximation to sucking. Cupping\r\nis especially valuable in wounds of the trunk, where a tourniquet\r\ncannot be applied. Intermittent squeezing and wringing of the part and\r\nsteeping in warm water is an excellent resort when no better measure\r\ncan be had. Cutting the wound open to its depth, while it may in\r\ncertain cases be necessary to allow of the thorough application of a\r\ncaustic, is objectionable as multiplying the points of infection and\r\nabsorption. Drinking of liquids to excess temporarily retards\r\nabsorption by overfilling the vascular system. Ammoniacal, alcoholic,\r\nand other stimulants are resorted to for the same purpose, being held\r\nto cause plenitude, not only by quantity, but by rarefying the animal\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nNo such measures should, however, be allowed to delay for an instant\r\nthe use of caustics. This is the one effectual means of destroying the\r\npoison, and the choice of caustic is of less consequence than its\r\nthorough application. The hot iron in the form of a skewer, nail,\r\npoker, or other available instrument, at a white heat, may be brought\r\nin contact with all parts of the wound to its utmost recesses.\r\n\r\nOf chemical caustics, solid sticks of nitrate of silver, chloride of\r\nzinc, {906} and potassa, or the crystals of cupric or ferric sulphate,\r\nare to be preferred to the liquid forms (mineral acids, butter of\r\nantimony, etc.), because of the greater thoroughness with which they\r\ncan be brought into contact with all parts of the wound. Lastly, the\r\ngalvano-cautery may be used if within reach. If the liquid caustics\r\nare employed, they may be introduced into the depth of the wound by\r\nmeans of a pipette, a piece of porous wood, or a pledget of tow. For a\r\ngreat number of small wounds a bath of corrosive sublimate has been\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the amputation of a badly-lacerated member or one with a\r\ncompound fracture offers the only measure of protection.\r\n\r\nBut although nothing should be allowed to delay cauterization, yet the\r\nimpossibility of an immediate application should not be accepted as a\r\nreason for its neglect at a later date. On the presumption that the\r\nvirus is localized in the seat of inoculation until it has increased\r\nlargely and is poured into the blood in sufficient quantity to\r\nsubjugate the blood-globules to its influence, it is logical to excise\r\nthe cicatrix and cauterize the wound, though days or even weeks have\r\nelapsed.\r\n\r\nIf it should be shown by further experiment that Galtier's intravenous\r\ninjection of virulent saliva is harmless and protective to sheep,\r\nrabbits, and it may be other Herbivora, it would be logical to employ\r\nthis in these animals just after they have been bitten, as there will\r\nbe ample time to establish the systemic influence of the intravenous\r\ninjection before the poison shall have accomplished its recrudescence\r\nin the cicatrix. The constantly fatal result of rabid bites in these\r\nanimals would at least warrant such an attempt, the main precaution\r\nbeing that the liquid shall be most carefully preserved from contact\r\nwith any of the tissues, including even the coats of the injected\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the local treatment of the sore, certain general\r\nmedication has usually been resorted to, though its real value may\r\nwell be questioned. Thus, the elimination of the poison has been\r\nsought by profuse perspiration induced by warm, Turkish, and Roman\r\nbaths, and by the use of medicinal agents, sudorifics, sialogogues\r\n(mercury), laxatives, and diuretics (cantharides). The neutralization\r\nof the poison has been attempted by ammonia, the sulphites and\r\nhyposulphites, chlorine, etc. Besides these are used nerve-sedatives\r\nand tonics, such as venesection, belladonna, prussic acid, tartar\r\nemetic, sulphates of copper and zinc, arsenic, strychnia, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably of greater importance is a sound hygiene. Stimulating\r\nfood eaten to excess is injurious alike to man and beast, and by\r\ninducing digestive disorder and cerebral congestion will tend at least\r\nto precipitate the attack. Costiveness or biliousness from sedentary\r\nhabits and lack of exercise in the outer air and sunshine, exposure to\r\nintense heat or cold and over-exertion, are all to be guarded against.\r\n\r\nFinally, psychical treatment is of the highest importance. Those about\r\nthe person who has been bitten should preserve a calm, equable, and\r\ncheerful demeanor and avoid all allusion to the occurrence. The\r\npatient should be protected against all sources of excitement, and\r\nshould not be allowed to see that he is an object of solicitude. If\r\nthe matter is referred to incidentally, he should be impressed with a\r\nconviction of the efficacy of the treatment adopted.\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT.--Almost every agent in the {907} Pharmacopoeia\r\nhas been employed as a remedy for hydrophobia, but, up to the present,\r\nit must be acknowledged, with no measure of success. The agents\r\nsupposed to be prophylactics are those also resorted to as therapeutic\r\nremedies. To these may be added the potent nerve-sedatives and\r\nanti-spasmodics--chloroform, chloral hydrate, ether, bromides of\r\npotassium, sodium, and ammonium, curare, Calabar bean, and the\r\nsialogogue diaphoretic pilocarpine.\r\n\r\nChloroform is one of the most appropriate, as it may be taken by\r\ninhalation, though with much excitement to the patient, and it at once\r\nrelieves the oppressed breathing and pharyngeal and other spasms,\r\nwhile it acts as a cerebral sedative and anæsthetic; and if it cannot\r\nbe held up as a curative agent, it at least secures euthanasia.\r\nChloral given as an injection, so as to induce its soporific action,\r\nis equally soothing, though nothing more. Curare injected\r\nhypodermically overcomes the spasms, but does not usually, if ever,\r\nretard death. Three cases of hydrophobia in man treated in this way\r\nrecovered, but we have no proof that even these exceptional cases were\r\nrabies. Pilocarpine has been used in a number of cases, but, with the\r\nexceptional case of a young man reported by Denis Dumont, all\r\nterminated fatally. The committee of the Paris Academy of Medicine\r\nreported in 1874 that in three experimental cases \"it hastened death\r\nby the fits it brought on.\" Morphia is often of great value in calming\r\nthe excitement and giving rest and sleep during the intervals of the\r\nparoxysms. Daturia and atropia, administered hypodermically, are\r\nsomewhat less effectual. Inhalation of oxygen is said to arrest the\r\nconvulsions and delirium, but not to retard death. Vaccine virus and\r\nthe venom of the viper have each been tried, but with no good effect.\r\n\r\nOf non-medicinal therapeutic measures the following are among the most\r\npromising: Perfect seclusion, quiet, and darkness serve to abate the\r\nhyperæsthesia, the painful acuteness of the senses, and the convulsive\r\nand delirious paroxysms. It can no longer be doubted that a very few\r\ncases of genuine rabies recover, but those that do so have almost all\r\nhad special advantages in the way of quiet and seclusion, and few have\r\nhad the excitement of medicinal treatment. Eight cases of the recovery\r\nof rabid dogs are reported by Menecier, Decroix, Laquerriere, Rey,\r\nHarold Leiney, and Pasteur. The two first were attested by successful\r\ninoculation on other animals; Decroix's second case was caused by\r\ninoculation with the saliva of a hydrophobous man; the next three had\r\nbeen bitten by dogs undoubtedly mad; while Pasteur's was inoculated\r\nwith the brain-matter of a rabid cow. All in due time presented the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of rabies, yet all recovered, without any\r\nrecord of medicinal treatment. Pasteur's case, when again inoculated,\r\nresisted the disease. A certain number of recoveries of men from\r\npronounced hydrophobia under medicine and without it are on record,\r\nbut in the absence of successful inoculations it is impossible to tell\r\nhow many were cases of infecting rabies. The parallel between rabies\r\nand tetanus in the intensity of the reflex excitability would demand\r\ndarkness and quiet as a sine quâ non of any rational treatment.\r\nFaradization has produced a temporary relief, but no permanent\r\nimprovement. Warm baths, steam baths, and hot-air baths serve to abate\r\nexcitability and spasm, and have been lauded as specific in\r\nhydrophobia, but have proved useless in the lower animals.\r\n\r\n{908} Intravenous injection of warm water (two pints) in a\r\nhydrophobous man reduced the pulse from 150 to 86 and restored the\r\npower of deglutition. Life was prolonged for nine days, but in great\r\nagony, from the supervention of suppurative arthritis (Majendie). In\r\nanother case the dread of water disappeared, but death ensued in\r\nfifty-four hours. In the hands of Youatt and Mayo it proved equally\r\nunsuccessful in dogs. A cold bath with submersion to unconsciousness\r\nis an old remedy now abandoned. Venesection to fainting, with or\r\nwithout mercury, mitigated the symptoms, but seemed to hasten\r\nparalysis and death. The excision and cauterization of the cicatrix,\r\nor the cutting of the nerves proceeding from it, has been useful in\r\ndelaying, or even absolutely preventing, the paroxysms. When,\r\ntherefore, the premonitory symptoms of hydrophobia have set in, and\r\nwhen an aura or shooting pain is felt proceeding from the seat of the\r\nwound toward the heart, one or other of these measures may serve to\r\nprevent the immediate occurrence of reflex convulsions. When the\r\npoison has actually invaded the brain, this can be looked on as a\r\npalliative measure only, but in the many cases of lyssophobia it may\r\nput an instant stop to the affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{909}\r\n\r\nGLANDERS (EQUINIA GRAVIOR, FARCY).\r\n\r\nBY JAMES LAW, F.R.C.V.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--_Greek_, [Greek: malis]. _Latin_, Malleus, Equinia Nasalis,\r\nE. Apostimatos, Farcinia. _French_, Morve, Farcin. _German_, Rotz,\r\nLungenrotz, Hautrotz, Wurm, Hautwurm. _Italian_, Morva, Moccis,\r\nCimurro. _Spanish_, Cimorro, Lamparones.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An infectious, bacteridian disease occurring in the\r\nhorse, ass, or mule, and communicated by inoculation to various other\r\nanimals, including man. It is usually ushered in by rigors, followed\r\nby articular pains, lameness, and the formation of a specific deposit\r\nin the lymphatic system of some part of the body, with a tendency to\r\ndestructive degeneration and ulceration. In the form known as glanders\r\nthese deposits and ulcers take place mainly in the nasal mucosa, in\r\nthe lungs, and in adjacent glands, while in that known as farcy the\r\ndeposits occur in the cutaneous and subcutaneous lymphatic plexuses\r\nand the dependent glands.\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--Under the name of malis\r\nAristotle describes a fatal disease of asses, supposed to have been\r\nidentical with the malleus humidus of Vegetius Renatus and other\r\nwriters of early Christian times, and with the cymoira of other early\r\nRoman writers. This malady was characterized by swelling of the\r\nsubmaxillary glands and discharge from nose and mouth. From the\r\nfourteenth century onward glanders is reported from different parts of\r\nEurope at frequent intervals; thus in 1320 in England (Rogers); in\r\n1640 in Badajoz, brought by Portugese horses (Villalba); in 1686 at\r\nTreves (Eggerdes); again in 1776 in Southern France (Lafosse); in 1794\r\nin Bavaria (Plank); in 1796 in Franconia (Laubender); and in 1798 in\r\nPiedmont (Toggia). At the beginning of the present century this\r\naffection was very widely prevalent in Great Britain, the chronic\r\ncases being habitually worked in stage-coaches, but of recent years,\r\nwhen it has been made criminal to expose or use a glandered horse, the\r\nmalady has to a great extent disappeared. To-day glanders is almost\r\ncoexistent with the distribution of the domesticated equine family,\r\nyet its prevalence bears a direct relation to the facilities for\r\ninfection (horse-traffic, war, preservation of the diseased,\r\nconfinement in close stables, ships, etc.), and some countries appear\r\nto be entirely free from the affection. Thus, Krabbe gives the yearly\r\nlosses per 100,000 horses for the principal countries of Europe and\r\nAlgiers as follows: Norway, 6; Denmark, 8.5; England, 14; Sweden, 57;\r\nWurtenberg, 77; Prussia, 78; Saxony, 95; Belgium, 138; {910} France\r\n(army), 1130; Algeria (army), 1548. The losses in Prussia more than\r\ndoubled after the Franco-German War; thus, in 1869-70 they were 966,\r\nand in 1873-74, 2058. In Bavaria they rose in the same period from 173\r\nto 390 (Hahn). In Lisbon, Portugal, glanders was unknown for the\r\nthirty years preceding the Peninsular War, whereas after the war it\r\nproved a veritable scourge (Saunier). Charles Percivall, during an\r\neight years' residence at Meerut and Cawnpore, Hindostan, saw not a\r\nsingle case of glanders, and so late as 1275, Fleming claims an entire\r\nimmunity for India; yet in 1877 complaints were numerous of the very\r\ngeneral prevalence of the disease in Upper India especially, while in\r\n1879 the campaign in Afghanistan was seriously affected by its\r\nravages. Climate appears to have little influence. The disease is\r\nvirtually unknown in the island of Bornholm with 7000 horses, and in\r\nthe Faroes and Iceland with 35,000, while it is quite frequent in\r\nSweden. It is unknown in Australia, but is very prevalent in China,\r\nSouth Africa, Abyssinia, and Algiers, and but little known in Asia\r\nMinor, Arabia, and Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn the United States as in Europe the disease has mainly concentrated\r\nitself in the large cities in times of peace, and spread widely on the\r\nadvent of war. It is alleged that it first entered Mexico in 1847 with\r\nthe American cavalry, though with the horses kept in the open air it\r\nfailed to gain a wide extension. The horses and mules drawn into the\r\nUnion armies in 1861 brought infection with them, and soon the disease\r\nwas most prevalent and destructive, not only in the ranks, but in\r\nevery State in which the armies operated. John R. Page says the first\r\ncase he saw in the Confederate army was a captured Federal troop-horse\r\non the retreat from Manassas, and that the breaking down of the\r\nConfederate cavalry in the last two years of the war was mainly due to\r\nglanders. At the close of the war the sale of army horses distributed\r\nthe infection widely through all the States, North as well as South.\r\nEvery year in a country district in Western New York I see several\r\ncases of glanders, and occasionally a whole stud is carried off\r\nthrough an infected purchase. In other States the case is no better.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan cases are constantly\r\nseen in the country districts, and in the three last-named States five\r\nhuman victims have been reported within a short period. In Connecticut\r\nthe same is true, and the disease made one human victim in Waterbury\r\nin 1879. In the large cities the case is still worse. Liautard of New\r\nYork in 1878, in a single visit to one car-stable, condemned 8 horses,\r\nin another stable 18, and in a third, at two visits, 45, while a\r\nfourth had lost no fewer than 200 horses in the course of one year\r\nfrom glanders. In the Troy (N.Y.) car-stables the malady prevailed\r\nfrom 1875-77, most of the subjects suffering from chronic farcy, until\r\nin the latter year, by my advice, these propagators of contagion were\r\ndestroyed. In Springfield, Mass., in 1879, the disease assumed such\r\nalarming proportions that it was vigorously suppressed by a city\r\nordinance enjoining summary slaughter. These are but indications of\r\nwhat is happening all over the country, entailing losses of many\r\nhundreds of thousands yearly as well as an enormous risk to humanity.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the number of cases occurring in the equine\r\nfamily in two of the principal countries of Europe in the last few\r\nyears: {911}\r\n\r\n  Cases of Glanders in--  Great Britain.  Germany.\r\n    1878                        888         2753\r\n    1879                       1367\r\n    1880                       2048         1941\r\n    1881                       1710         1774\r\n    1882                       1389         1838\r\n\r\nAs both countries systematically suppress this disease through their\r\nveterinary sanitary officials, it cannot be doubted that the figures\r\nfor America, if obtainable, would be relatively higher.\r\n\r\nGlanders prevails especially in horses, asses, mules, and other\r\nsolipedes, and is communicated by inoculation to all domestic animals\r\nexcept the genus Bovis. In the sheep and goat the receptivity is\r\nconsiderable, and the disease may prove fatal in fifteen days\r\n(Gerlach) or it may be delayed for seven weeks (Bollinger). The\r\nCarnivora (dogs, cats, lions, polar bears) contract the affection by\r\neating diseased flesh, as do some rodents (prairie-dogs, rabbits,\r\nguinea-pigs, mice), and, by administration, solipedes. Swine contract\r\nthe disease by inoculation (Gerlach, Spinola), though in these and in\r\nthe dog the constitutional symptoms are usually slight and recovery\r\nmay follow the local affection.\r\n\r\nThe susceptibility of man is doubtless less than that of the\r\nsolipedes, judging from the few cases of glanders compared with the\r\nfrequent exposures, yet when once established in the system it can\r\nhardly be said to be less malignant or fatal.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The one known cause of glanders is contagion, and the\r\nrecent experiments of Capitan and Charrin in France and of Schütz and\r\nLöfler in Germany, demonstrating that the bacillus of the glanderous\r\ndeposits is the one essential cause of the disease, effectually\r\ndispose of any claim of its spontaneous origin. Glanders can no longer\r\nbe considered spontaneous, further than that its germ is now proved\r\ncapable, like that of anthrax, of survival and multiplication out of\r\nthe animal economy, so that infection may come from other objects than\r\na sick animal; and it may even yet appear that the bacillus, living at\r\ntimes as a harmless saprophyte out of the animal body, may acquire\r\ndeadly properties under certain conditions of the environment. At the\r\nsame time, the most extensive acquaintance with glanders and the\r\nbroadest generalizations from known facts do not warrant the\r\nassumption of the extension of the disease by the growth of the\r\nbacillus out of the living body, unless it be on the rarest possible\r\noccasions, while the soundness of extensive countries (Australia, New\r\nZealand) for a century or more speaks strongly against any frequent\r\ndevelopment from a harmless saprophyte.\r\n\r\nTo the same effect speak the experiences of the English army. At the\r\nbeginning of the century, under the teaching of Coleman, most cases\r\nwere attributed to lack of stable care, and extensive experiments were\r\nmade in the treatment of the disease, with the result of a very high\r\nmortality from this cause. Now, when contagion is looked on as the\r\nmain or sole cause, and all suspected horses in the army are promptly\r\ndestroyed, the disease is only seen in recently-purchased animals or\r\nafter the inevitable exposures of a campaign.[1] In the French army\r\nthe doctrine of the {912} non-contagiousness of chronic glanders led\r\nto a greater prevalence of this disease than in any other country of\r\nEurope. Prior to 1836 it was about 90 per 1000 per annum, whereas now,\r\nunder the doctrine of contagion and a corresponding practice, glanders\r\nkills but 2 per 1000 per annum (Rossignol).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Wilkinson, _Jour. of Roy. Agr. Soc._, No. 50.]\r\n\r\nBut while the essential cause of glanders is the specific bacillus, an\r\nindividual susceptibility is no less requisite to an attack. This may\r\nbe innate or acquired. As we have seen, it varies according to the\r\ngenus, being greatest in the solipede. But many solipedes show a\r\nstrong power of resistance. Of 138 horses similarly exposed by\r\ncohabitation with glandered horses, but 29 (21 per cent.) suffered. Of\r\n28 inoculated with glanders virus, but 9 (32 per cent.) succumbed\r\n(Lamirault, Bagge, Tscherning). The accessory causes which predispose\r\nthe system to the reception of glanders may be included under one\r\ngeneral term--low condition and ill health. Three of these causes,\r\nhowever, deserve especial mention: 1st. Impure and rebreathed air.\r\nPrior to 1836 the yearly losses per 1000 of the French army horses\r\nwere from 180 to 197. At the date named the ventilation of the stables\r\nwas greatly improved, and the mortality fell to 68 per 1000 per annum,\r\none-half from glanders. Later improvements have reduced the 34 cases\r\nto 2. During the Italian War, in 1859, 10,000 of these horses were\r\nkept for nine months in open sheds, with but one case of glanders.[2]\r\nIn the expedition to Quibéron during the Napoleonic wars, a cavalry\r\ncontingent, believed to be healthy, shipped on new transports,\r\nencountered a storm, and had the hatches fastened down, so that\r\nseveral horses were suffocated. Among the survivors, landed at\r\nSouthampton and placed in stables hitherto unchallenged, many soon\r\ndeveloped glanders in its worst form. Similar results followed the\r\nEnglish expeditions to Varna in 1854, and that to Abyssinia in 1867.\r\nIn badly-ventilated mines and stables, especially cellar stables,\r\nglanders, once started, is always most virulent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Larrey, _Hyg. des Hop. Mil._, 1862, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n2d. Cold, damp, draughty stables greatly favor the progress of\r\nglanders. Leblanc reports the case of a stud of 240 horses that had\r\nhad no glanders for eight years, but which lost half their number in\r\nthree months after removal into a new stable, very lofty, but dark and\r\ndamp, and subject to cold draughts. It is worthy of notice that they\r\nhad also been subjected to double work, and were consequently\r\nemaciated, but there was not known to be any unusual exposure to\r\ncontagion. In a Boston street-car stable, where glanders had long\r\nprevailed, Thayer cut it short by destroying the infected animals and\r\nby improving the ventilation by windows hung at the bottom and opening\r\ninward, so that the air entered in an upward direction, and cold\r\ndraughts on the horses were avoided.\r\n\r\n3d. Debility from ill-health, low feeding, or overwork.--The nervous\r\nand nutritive debility consequent on chronic disease, overwork, and\r\nexhaustion lessens the power of resistance to specific poisons, but in\r\nsuch circumstances there is always the added predisposition of an\r\nexcess of waste material in the blood, a specially abundant food for\r\nthe disease-germ. So notorious is this that it used to be held that\r\nthe specific poison of glanders was generated in connection with the\r\nexcess of creatine, creatinine, and lactic acid resulting from\r\nmuscular action. Of the effect of {913} low diet we have a striking\r\nexample, furnished by Bouley, of a stud of 120 horses, 60 of which\r\nwere attacked within a year after they had been placed on a food\r\ninsufficient to repair the body-waste, and from which the disease\r\ndisappeared after the slaughter of the infected and improvement of the\r\nration. So long as glandered horses were preserved for work, the then\r\nnearly ubiquitous germ attacked nearly all that were run down by\r\nchronic diseases; hence glanders was looked upon as the natural\r\nwinding up of exhausting diseases in the horse, as tuberculosis was\r\nthought to be in the human subject. Modern discovery shows that\r\nwithout the germ all such debilitating causes are impotent, but it can\r\nnever disprove the great potency of these in laying the system open to\r\nattack, nor the value of vigorous health and sound hygiene in\r\nfortifying the system against it.\r\n\r\nThe channel of infection manifestly varies in different cases. In\r\ndirect inoculations the morbid process develops first at the point of\r\ninsertion, and secondly in the nearest lymphatic glands and internal\r\norgans. When contracted in the ordinary way, the lesions are usually\r\nfirst seen in the posterior nasal passages, the larynx or the lungs,\r\nor in the superficial lymphatics, especially of the hind limbs. This\r\nsusceptibility of the deeper portions of the air-passages seems to\r\nimply that the bacillus, borne on the air, is lodged on different\r\nparts of the respiratory mucous membrane, and first sets up the morbid\r\nprocess in the thinnest or most susceptible portion. That it can be\r\nthus borne on the air is shown by the experiments of Viborg and\r\nGerlach, who separately collected the particulate elements from the\r\nexhalations of glandered horses and successfully inoculated them. That\r\nthe virus is not usually carried far on the air in a virulent form is\r\nattested by the many instances in which horses have stood for months\r\nin the same stable with a glandered animal without becoming infected.\r\nThat infection may also take place through the ingestion of infected\r\nmatters is undoubted, as glanderous products mixed with food, or even\r\nmade into balls and enclosed in paper and administered to horses in\r\nthis form, have produced the disease. The virulence is said to be lost\r\nby passing through the digestive canal of man (Decroix), dog, pig, and\r\nfowl (Renault), but even to Carnivora the infection may be conveyed in\r\nthe food.\r\n\r\nWhile the virus is concentrated in the material of the special\r\nglanderous deposits and the discharges from these, yet no part of the\r\nbody can be considered as free from the poison. Viborg, Coleman,\r\nHering, and Chauveau have communicated the disease by transfusion of\r\nblood from a glandered horse to a healthy one; hence every vascular\r\norgan must be liable to infect. The secretions of the diseased body\r\n(tears, saliva, mucus, sweat, urine, and milk) have each been\r\nsuccessfully inoculated, and the conveyance of the disease to the\r\nfoetus in utero and to the female by coition imply that even the\r\ngenerative secretions are virulent. Failures to convey the disease by\r\ninoculation with the blood and secretions have often occurred,\r\nhowever, and they must be held as less virulent than the products of\r\nthe local disease-processes.\r\n\r\nThe claims that inoculation with pus, ichor, and other irritants have\r\nproduced glanders must be entirely discredited. The deposits and\r\nulcers in the lungs and elsewhere resulting from such inoculations\r\nhave been either septicæmia, mistaken for glanders in the earlier days\r\nof pathological anatomy; or the septic and other inflammations set up\r\nby these {914} inoculations have merely served as fertile spots for\r\nthe planting and growth of the glanders bacillus accidentally present,\r\nand which to a healthy system might have proved harmless.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, Chauveau had demonstrated the particulate nature of the\r\nglander germ by his unsuccessful inoculations with the liquids\r\nfiltered from dilutions of pus taken from a pulmonary glanderous\r\nulcer. The filtrate and the liquid mixture formed by mixing the pus\r\nwith five hundred times its own weight of water retained their\r\nvirulence undiminished. In 1868, Christol and Kiener discovered in\r\nglanderous products a bacillus which they figured as made up of a\r\nchain of nearly globular elements apparently enclosed in a common\r\nsheath. In 1881-82, Bouchard, Capitan, and Charrin cultivated these\r\nmicrophytes in a neutralized extract of meat through five successive\r\ncultures, using in each case a milligramme of the previous culture, or\r\nless than 1/1000 part of the culture-liquid. Counting that the\r\nmilligramme of pus would give to each centigramme of the first\r\nculture-liquid 1,000,000,000 bacilli, it follows that the second\r\nculture would, on the principle of dilution, contain 1,000,000, the\r\nthird 1000, the fourth 1, while for the fifth it was as 999 to 1 that\r\nit would receive nothing unless the germ were multiplied in the\r\nculture-liquid. Inoculation of a cat with this fifth culture, started\r\noriginally from a nasal ulcer of a glandered horse, led to a fatal\r\nresult in twenty-five days, with suppurating tumor of the left\r\ntesticle and inguinal glands. The products of the first cat were\r\ninoculated on a second, those of the last on a third, those of the\r\nthird on a guinea-pig, and those of the guinea-pig on an ass,\r\nproducing in every case specific lesions of glanders, including\r\nmiliary nodules and abscesses, and death respectively on the following\r\ndays: 16, 7, 31, and 10.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1882, and the two succeeding months, a similar course of\r\nexperiments was conducted by Schütz and Löfler at Berlin. The virulent\r\nmatter used for starting the culture was procured from a pulmonary\r\ndeposit and spleen of a glandered horse; the cultivation was continued\r\nthrough eight successive culture-fluids. One horse was successfully\r\ninoculated with the product of the eighth culture, and a second with\r\nboth the fifth and eighth. The first died on the fifty-eighth day, and\r\nthe second, now very weak, was sacrificed on the fifty-ninth. Both\r\nshowed the most extensive lesions of glanders alike in the skin, the\r\nlymphatic glands, the pituitary and laryngeal mucous membrane, and the\r\nlungs. To demonstrate the bacillus they take a thin layer of the\r\ninfecting liquid on a cover glass, dry it, stain with methyl violet,\r\nwash with dilute acetic acid, dehydrated by absolute alcohol, and\r\nclear by oil of cedar. Like other pathogenic microphytes this may be\r\npreserved for months or years if thoroughly dried, but in the moist\r\ncondition it is easily destroyed by heat (133° F.; Viborg, Hofacker,\r\nRenault), chlorine, and the disinfectant chlorides and sulphites.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Acute nasal glanders in horses has a period of incubation\r\nlasting from three to five days in inoculated cases. Where in infected\r\nsubjects the incubation appears to have extended over months or a\r\nyear, there have usually (or always) been deposits in internal organs\r\nwhich passed without recognition until the lesions appeared in the\r\nnose. At the outset there is fever, which appears before any local\r\nlesions are recognizable, even post-mortem (Chauveau), and soon with\r\nlanguor, {915} and loss of appetite, there is a serous nasal\r\ndischarge, often from one side only. By the sixth day this has become\r\nyellowish, the margin of the nostril is often swollen, and upon the\r\npituitary membrane may be detected elevations of various sizes of a\r\ngeneral yellowish tinge, dotted with minute red points and surrounded\r\nby a bright-red or purple and slightly elevated areola. These may be\r\nsimple, pea-like nodules or more or less extensive patches, which in\r\ncertain cases extend over nearly the whole pituitary membrane. At the\r\nsame time the submaxillary lymphatic glands on the same side become\r\nthe seat of a hard nodular painless enlargement, feeling like a\r\nconglomerate mass of peas, and often showing a tendency to become more\r\nclosely adherent to some adjacent part (bone, skin, base of tongue);\r\nbut they only ulcerate exceptionally. Extensive hot, painful\r\nengorgements also often appear on other parts of the body, and if on\r\nthe limbs or joints cause lameness. Soon the swellings on the mucosa\r\nbecome eroded and are gradually destroyed, forming large unhealthy,\r\nchancrous-looking ulcers, tending to become confluent and to eat\r\ndeeply through the mucosa into the subjacent tissues. These are mostly\r\nreddish gray or yellowish gray, with raised ragged red or\r\nyellowish-red margins. They bleed readily, and may be black from\r\nhemorrhage, or greenish or of some other shade from decomposition. The\r\ndischarge is always somewhat glutinous and sticky, but it may vary in\r\ncolor from simple white to yellowish, greenish, brownish, or red,\r\naccording to the destruction of tissue, the septic changes, or the\r\neffusion of blood.\r\n\r\nBy the sixth to the fifteenth day the acme has been reached. The alæ\r\nof the nostrils are glued together by the drying discharge, and this,\r\nwith the general swelling of the nasal passages, renders the breathing\r\nsnuffling and difficult. The lymphatics on the side of the face are\r\nusually inflamed and corded, and the same is true of the cutaneous\r\nlymphatics of the hind limbs of some other part of the body (farcy).\r\nDeath usually ensues from suffocation, preceded by the most painful\r\ndyspnoea.\r\n\r\nChronic glanders in horses often sets in insidiously, but frequently\r\nalso it first shows itself by constitutional disturbance, which\r\ngradually subsides as the local lesions are formed. Among frequent\r\npremonitory symptoms may be mentioned intermittent or continued\r\nlameness, oedema of one or more limbs, infiltration of the testicle,\r\ncough, and bleeding from the nose. The general health may appear good,\r\nand if in good hygienic condition the digestion and nutrition may be\r\nsufficient, the body plump, and the skin shining; but there is usually\r\nsome dulness of the eye, dryness of the coat, lack of endurance, and a\r\ntendency to sweat easily and to run down rapidly under hard work or\r\ndebilitating conditions. The discharge, at first clear, becomes\r\nturbid, grayish, sticky, and purulent, tending to agglutinate the\r\nhairs and edges of the alæ nasi, and is expelled by snorting in\r\nmasses. The nasal mucosa, and especially over the septum, is the seat\r\nof the peculiar elevations, ulcers, and firm white, condensed deposits\r\nresembling cicatrices, usually low enough down to be seen or felt. The\r\nsubmaxillary lymphatic glands are the seat of the nodular enlargement\r\ndescribed in acute glanders, and, as in that affection, there may be\r\npulmonary or skin deposits shown by cough or oedema, with swelling and\r\ncording of the cutaneous lymphatics with nodules and ulcers.\r\n\r\nThese cases often maintain this indolent type for years, spreading the\r\n{916} infection widely, but they tend sooner or later to develop the\r\nacute type, especially under some debilitating conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen the mucous membrane of the larynx and bronchi is first attacked\r\nthe nasal lesions may be delayed for a time, but the cough, the\r\nvariously colored tenacious expectoration, the excessive tenderness of\r\nthe larynx, and the nodular enlargement of the adjacent lymphatic\r\nglands, with the general ill-condition, suggest that which is later\r\nconfirmed by the specific lesions in nose and skin.\r\n\r\nWhen the affection is confined to the bronchia and pulmonary\r\nparenchyma, there are the usual signs of bronchitis, disturbed\r\nbreathing, with hard, soft, mucous, or dry husky cough, and blowing,\r\nmucous or sibilant râle, at points crepitation, and at others some\r\ndiminution of murmur and resonance. The breath is mawkish or fetid,\r\nand expectoration more or less sticky and charged with bacilli; but\r\nall these symptoms are at times equivocal, and inoculation alone can\r\nattest the true nature of the disease. This should be practised by\r\npreference on a donkey or an old horse in poor condition but with\r\ngeneral good health. Then the disease shows itself in the acute form\r\nin six days. If solipedes are not available, rabbits or guinea-pigs\r\nmay be used for inoculation.\r\n\r\nIn acute cutaneous glanders or farcy, premonitory symptoms resemble\r\nthose of ordinary acute glanders, which indeed is usually present as\r\nwell, and always supervenes before farcy terminates in death. The\r\nlocal lesions consist in inflammation of the lymphatic vessels, which\r\nbecome like firm cords, the appearance at intervals along these cords\r\nof rounded glanderous nodules varying in size from a pea to a\r\nhickory-nut, and with a marked tendency to ulceration and the\r\nformation of hot, painful oedematous swellings. The swelling of the\r\nlymphatics appears by preference in the lower part of a hind limb, and\r\nthe first nodules may be near the fetlock or tarsus. The ulcers\r\nforming about the sixth day have a yellowish-white appearance with red\r\npoints and raised irregular borders, and the discharge is grumous and\r\nviscous, with a yellowish or reddish tinge. The disease extends toward\r\nthe body, the upper air-passages become involved, and death speedily\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nChronic cutaneous glanders, chronic farcy, usually begins by a local\r\nswelling, mostly of the fetlock, in the midst of which a careful\r\nexamination detects a small glanderous nodule. This tardily softens,\r\nulcerates, and discharges the characteristic ichor, the lymphatics\r\nleading up from it become thick and rigid (corded), and new nodules\r\nappear. Though very indolent, these finally tend to ulcerate, and in\r\ntime oedematous swellings appear in the vicinity or at distant parts\r\nof the body, with nodules at intervals. This will go on for months, or\r\neven for years, and recoveries occasionally take place, while in other\r\ncases, and especially when the conditions of life are bad, acute\r\nglanders supervene.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions consist essentially in a cellular growth\r\nin the connective tissue, determined by the presence of the specific\r\npoison, and in destructive changes in the elements of such\r\ngrowth--softening, fatty degeneration, ulceration, and discharge. In\r\ncertain cases of nasal glanders at the earliest stage there is merely\r\nan increased proliferation of the mucous corpuscles, which become more\r\ngranular or purulent. Soon, however, the fibro-vascular layer is\r\ninvolved, the affected part being the seat of dark bluish congestion,\r\nand {917} of the proliferation of small rounded lymphoid cells,\r\ncomparable to those of the early stage of tubercle, and enclosed in\r\nmore or less dense fibrous areolæ. The common nasal nodule or patch\r\nhas a soft velvety surface, dirty gray or grayish yellow, and the\r\nlymphoid cells are so circumscribed in nests that when soaked in water\r\nthe cells are washed out and the fibrous reticulum is left hollowed\r\nout like a honeycomb. In this fibrous reticulum are many\r\nspindle-shaped and a few rounded cells. Its vascularity is easily\r\ndemonstrated by injection. The centre of each nest is the palest part\r\nof the mass, and unless stained by extravasation it contrasts with the\r\nreddish areola. These islets of lymphoid cells, at first isolated and\r\neach the size of a pin's head, may enlarge and become confluent,\r\nforming the larger nodules. With this increase the centre of each\r\nbecomes turbid, and the cells are found to have become granular and\r\nfatty, and to have in part broken up into a granular débris. This\r\ncharacterizes the period of ulceration, and erosions and ulcers follow\r\nin ratio with the extent of the neoplasm and the rapidity of its\r\ngrowth. If the growth is tardy, the ulcer, with irregular eroded and\r\neverted edges, may remain for some time stationary or even recede,\r\nwhile if rapid, new tubercles form around the margin of the first, and\r\nby the disintegration of their elements the ulcer is continuously\r\nextended. The lesions are especially common on the septum nasi and\r\nturbinated bones. Similar lesions may be found in the nasal sinuses or\r\nlarynx.\r\n\r\nThe nodules found in the lungs strongly resemble miliary tubercles,\r\nbut are usually less numerous. As in the nose, they have a punctiform,\r\ncentral, grayish, turbid portion, encircled by a more translucent\r\nring, surrounded in its turn by a vascular area. They are also\r\ncomposed of the same granular rounded cells, though they may,\r\nespecially in the chronic forms, have undergone caseous, fibrous, or\r\ncalcareous degeneration. The acute tubercles are often surrounded by\r\ncircumscribed pneumonia with considerable exudation. They are\r\ndistinguished from genuine tubercle by their vascularity and by the\r\nabsence of giant-cells.\r\n\r\nThe cutaneous deposits are composed of the same histological products\r\nimbedded in the dermis or in the subcutaneous connective tissue, and\r\nextending in some cases deeply between the muscles, with no clear line\r\nof demarcation from the sound tissue. Not only the chains of nodules\r\n(farcy-buds), but the connecting lymphatic trunks, are the seat of the\r\ncharacteristic cellular product, and in chronic cases there is the\r\nenlargement of the adjacent lymphatic glands as well. In these there\r\nis a special tendency to early disintegration and ulceration.\r\n\r\nIn the diffuse glanderous swellings (infiltrated glanders,\r\ninflammatory glanders) the affected tissues are the seat of an\r\ninflammatory process with profuse exudation throughout, while in the\r\ninterstices of the connective tissue are numerous granular\r\nglander-cells. The same tendency to necrobiosis is shown as in the\r\nother forms of glanderous neoplasms, and such diffuse swellings become\r\nthe seats of very extensive, deep, and irregular ulcers, or frequently\r\nof fibroid growth and induration, forming the so-called cicatricial\r\ndeposits. These are hard, firm, and resistant, and histologically\r\nconsist of a dense fibrous stroma interspersed with the spindle-shaped\r\ncells. They are especially common in chronic cases, and such an\r\nappearance on the nasal mucous membrane is always suspicious, as this\r\ndense fibroid appearance rarely follows a simple traumatic lesion.\r\n\r\n{918} Diffuse glanderous infiltrations in the nose may implicate the\r\nentire mucosa of one or both nasal chambers, and the ulcers are liable\r\nto be greater than from the nodular form of the disease. They are also\r\nespecially associated with thrombosis of the veins, which occurs to a\r\nless extent in the nodular form and conduces to the dark-blue tint of\r\nthe mucosa.\r\n\r\nGlanderous infiltration of the lungs is inflammatory in its nature\r\n(pneumonia malleosa), attacking an area of two or three inches in\r\ndiameter at or near the margin of the lungs, and proceeds to caseous\r\nnecrobiosis, suppuration, calcification, or fibroid induration. In the\r\nskin such infiltrations also frequently terminate in induration, while\r\nulceration and abscess tend to appear when the proliferation of\r\nglander-cells is most abundant (farcy-buds).\r\n\r\nThe glander-nodules are not uncommon in muscles, intermuscular\r\nconnective tissue, spleen, liver, kidneys, and testicles. Leukæmia is\r\nalso a constant feature, the irritation of the lymphatic glands\r\nmanifestly stimulating the production of the lymph-cells.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of glanders usually rests on the viscid\r\nnature of the discharge, the painless nodular swelling of the\r\nsubmaxillary glands and the indisposition to suppurate, the\r\ncharacteristic appearance of the nodules, elevations, ulcers, and\r\nindurations of the nasal mucosa, and the presence of the specific\r\nbacillus. The diagnosis of farcy rests mainly on the nature of the\r\nnodules and corded lymphatics, of the ulcers and their discharges, on\r\nthe extension of the affection toward the trunk, and the tendency to\r\nimplicate the respiratory organs. Usually, there are several victims,\r\nthe earlier ones chronic cases, the later ones acute, or there is a\r\nhistory or presumption of exposure. Yet in many cases, and especially\r\nin the more chronic internal forms (laryngeal, pulmonary, etc.), the\r\ndiagnosis is difficult, and inoculation of a horse, goat, sheep, or\r\nrabbit may be the only available means of reaching a decision.\r\nAuto-inoculations are unreliable, as parts not yet the seat of active\r\ndisease will often resist inoculation.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--This is always unfavorable. The constancy of internal\r\ndeposits and the viability of the germ in such products render it\r\nimpossible to eliminate the poison from the system in the great\r\nmajority of cases. In external glanders only is there any reasonably\r\ngood hope, and even this is confined to the chronic cases. In stating\r\nthis much, it is not denied that recoveries even of chronic nasal\r\nglanders do occur, yet these are few, and the majority of those that\r\ndo apparently recover usually succumb as soon as they are subjected to\r\nhard work or specially trying conditions of life, so that but little\r\nfaith can be placed in most of the alleged recoveries.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Considering the great danger of multiplying and preserving\r\nthe germs of a disease so fatal alike to man and beast, the treatment\r\nof glanders is never commendable. The danger is least in the case of\r\nchronic farcy, not only because the processes are less active, but\r\nbecause the virus is not being thrown out and diffused with the tidal\r\nair of respiration, sneezing, and coughing. The unbroken farcy-buds\r\nand swollen lymphatics may be actively treated by compound iodine\r\nointment, and the ulcerous nodules freely cauterized with corrosive\r\nsublimate, biniodide of mercury, chloride of zinc, sulphate of copper,\r\nor iodized {919} phenol. Local inflammations may demand fomentations\r\nand astringent antiseptic lotions. Meanwhile, the system must be\r\nsupported by a tonic regimen and medication, abundance of pure air, a\r\nliberal and wholesome diet, and the maintenance of the various bodily\r\nfunctions in a healthy condition. Of medicinal agents the most\r\npronounced tonics have the best reputation--sulphate of copper and\r\niron, biniodide of copper, arsenic, and, above all, arsenite of\r\nstrychnia. Next to these the sulphites rank, and a combination of the\r\ntwo last named is perhaps to be preferred.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.--The glandered horses and all animals attacked with acute\r\nor obstinate farcy should be destroyed and their bodies be burned or\r\ndeeply buried. Every State should legally interdict the use of a\r\nglandered horse or his exposure in any public or other place where\r\ninfection is likely to reach other animals by contact or through\r\nfodder, litter, stable utensils, or any other objects employed about\r\nanimals. No less imperative should be the perfect disinfection of all\r\nstables, harness, and other objects with which glandered animals have\r\ncome in contact. The value of such measures is sufficiently attested\r\nby what has been stated above as to the prevalence of this disease in\r\nthe French army so long as the doctrines of non-contagion dominated in\r\nits management, and the comparative disappearance of the disease so\r\nsoon as a change of theory and method had been inaugurated; the\r\nabsence of the disease in the English army, where the doctrine of\r\ncontagion and its extinction has long prevailed; and the entire\r\nabsence of the disease from Australia, New Zealand, etc., into which\r\nit has never been imported, though prevailing in a corresponding\r\nlatitude and climate at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlanders in Man.\r\n\r\nUp to 1812 the communication of glanders to man failed to be\r\nrecognized. Then Lorin, a French surgeon, published a case of the kind\r\nin which inflammation of the hand was induced by inoculation from a\r\nhorse suffering from farcy, and Waldinger and Weith drew attention to\r\nthe dangers of infection about the same time. In 1821, Muscroft in\r\nEngland and Schilling in Germany simultaneously reported cases of\r\ninfection from the horse in which the true symptoms of glanders in man\r\nwere recognized. Rust, Sedow, and Weiss soon followed with additional\r\ncases; then Forozzi (1822), Seidler (1823), Wolff, Grossheim, Eck,\r\nBrunslow, Lesser, Travers (1826), Kries, Grubb, Brown (1829), Neumann\r\n(1830), Vogeli (1831), Alexander (1832), and Elliotson (1833). Though\r\nthe disease was now well recognized, yet its nature has been\r\nelucidated by a series of later writers, including especially Rayer,\r\nTardieu, Virchow, Leisering, Gerlach, and Korányi.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--Man is rarely infected from any other source than the\r\nhorse. In a very few instances the contagion has been derived from\r\ninfected men. The modes of infection, immediate and mediate, are the\r\nmain points to notice in this connection. Those employed about horses\r\nare usually infected by direct contact of the poisonous discharges,\r\nblood, or tissues with abrasions on the skin or mucous membranes. The\r\ninoculation received in giving medicine, examining the nose,\r\nperforming operations with effusion of blood, dressing cutaneous\r\nulcers, slaughtering, {920} skinning, making a necropsy, burying,\r\netc., is not uncommon. Again, direct infection is sustained through\r\nsnorting of the horse, so that particles of the virulent discharge are\r\nlodged on the mucous membrane of the eye or nose. Closely allied to\r\nthis is infection by inhaling the exhalations of glandered horses, and\r\nthis doubtless accounts for some few cases which have been recorded as\r\ncommunicated through the unbroken skin. The bite of the glandered\r\nhorse is a rare means of infection. From infection by eating glandered\r\nanimals man is usually saved by the cooking of his food and by his\r\ninherent power of resistance, yet with instances of this kind on\r\nrecord, as recorded by Ringheim, and the well-known conveyance of the\r\ndisease to animals in this way, it would be folly to ignore the risk\r\nto man from eating the flesh of glandered horses, sheep, goats, and\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nAmong the mediate forms of contagion may be named drinking from the\r\nsame pail or trough after a glandered horse, using a knife that has\r\nbeen employed to open a glanderous abscess, wiping a wound with an\r\ninfected blanket or handkerchief, handling infected harness,\r\nwagon-pole, or manger with wounded hands, sleeping over glandered\r\nhorses or in a stall or on litter previously used by such horses.\r\n\r\nConveyance of glanders from man to man has taken place through using\r\nor handling the same dishes, towels, or handkerchiefs, through\r\ndressing the wounds, or, as in the case of the veterinarian Gerard,\r\nthrough making an autopsy of a victim of the disease.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the susceptibility of man is slight, but few out of the\r\nmultitudes handling glandered horses becoming infected. It is\r\nessentially an industrial disease, 114 cases being distributed as\r\nfollows among the different occupations: hostlers, 42; farmers and\r\nhorse-owners, 19; horse-butchers, 13; coachmen and drivers, 11;\r\nveterinary surgeons and students, 10; soldiers, 5; surgeons, 4;\r\ngardeners, 3; horse-dealers, 2; policemen, shepherds, blacksmiths,\r\nemployés at veterinary school, and washerwomen, 1 of each.\r\n\r\nA condition of ill-health doubtless predisposes to this as to other\r\ninvasions of infectious disease, yet men in apparently the most\r\nvigorous health have succumbed to the poison.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--The incubation of acute glanders in inoculated cases\r\nusually varies from one to four days. In cases in which the mode of\r\nentrance is not so manifest it may apparently extend over one, two, or\r\neven three weeks. If the disease has occurred by external inoculation,\r\nthe seat of the wound shows the first symptoms, consisting of tense\r\nswelling, pain, and a dark or yellowish erysipelatoid redness, while\r\nthe edges of the wound are puffy and everted, the matter escaping is\r\nsanious, and the surrounding lymphatics are swollen and red and the\r\nlymphatic glands enlarged and tender. After a few days constitutional\r\ndisorder sets in--languor, extreme weakness and prostration, aching in\r\nthe limbs (muscles and joints) and in the head, rigors alternating\r\nwith fever or a continued fever after the first violent chill, and in\r\nsome cases nausea, vomiting, and even diarrhoea. In cases not\r\nresulting from external inoculation the febrile symptoms are the\r\nearliest to be noticed, and the muscular and articular pains may be at\r\nfirst mistaken for acute rheumatism. In other cases, in which the\r\ngastric and intestinal disorders are the most prominent and the\r\nprostration and weariness extreme, the symptoms at first strongly\r\n{921} suggest typhoid fever. Soon, however, with a sense of\r\nformication a local yellowish or livid erysipelatoid inflammation\r\nappears, by preference on the softer parts of the face, the nose,\r\neyelids, cheeks, or on one of the principal joints, the shoulder,\r\nelbow, or knee. In the midst of the phlegmonous swelling, or even\r\nantecedent to it, there appear small firm red spots or nodules,\r\nsometimes as small as those of variola, at others like a pea or as\r\nlarge as a walnut or larger. These gradually blanch in the centre,\r\nsoften, and change into pustules or abscesses, and, bursting,\r\ndischarge a slimy, thick, sanguineous pus, often emitting a mawkish or\r\nfetid odor. The sores thus formed are ulcerous and unhealthy, with\r\npuffy, ragged, everted borders and a grayish or yellowish red base,\r\nwhich often extends deeply between the muscles and exposes tendons and\r\nbones. When several deposits of this kind are closely aggregated, they\r\ntend to combine in one slough, which may involve a great extent of\r\ntissue. In all cases there are the swollen, reddened, tender condition\r\nof the connecting lymphatics and the tumefaction of the lymphatic\r\nglands. At times the deposits and abscesses are deeply seated in the\r\ninterstices of the muscles, and at other times the joints are enlarged\r\nby exudation.\r\n\r\nIn nearly one-half of the cases glanders supervenes on the cutaneous\r\nsymptoms. At first a viscid, whitish nasal catarrh appears from one or\r\nboth nostrils, mixed with striæ of blood; then upon the pituitary\r\nmembrane appear ulcers like those already described in the horse; the\r\nsame form on the buccal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal mucous membranes,\r\nand by physical examination they may even be found to have invaded the\r\nlungs. The margins of the nostrils become adherent through the drying\r\nof the tenacious mucus; the meati are blocked or narrowed by the\r\nswelling of the mucosa, the detachment of sloughs, and the\r\naccumulation of the discharges; the breathing becomes snuffling and\r\ndifficult; the voice altered or lost; the cough weak, with a mucous\r\nand bloody expectoration, and the breath offensively fetid. The\r\nsubmaxillary lymphatic glands are inflamed and enlarged, and may even\r\ngo on to suppuration and ulceration. The conjunctiva is usually\r\ninvolved, and at times the specific formation and ulceration extend to\r\nthe stomach and intestines, and nausea, vomiting, indigestion,\r\nirregularity of the bowels, and fetid diarrhoea ensue. There is\r\ncomplete anorexia, but thirst is ardent, especially with diarrhoea.\r\nWith the advance of the disease dyspnoea supervenes, and nervous\r\ndisorder is shown by the extreme weakness, anxiety, sleeplessness,\r\ntroubled dreams, nocturnal delirium, dilated pupils, and even coma.\r\nThe temperature, though at first unaltered, may later rise to 104° F.,\r\nand the pulse to 110 to 120 beats per minute. The diagnosis is\r\nconfirmed by detection of the bacillus in the discharges, and, above\r\nall, in the liquids of freshly-opened pustules (Wassilieff).\r\n\r\nThe duration of acute glanders in man may be no more than three days,\r\nthough usually it is protracted to fourteen or twenty-one, and\r\nexceptionally to twenty-nine days. The almost constant termination of\r\nthis form of the disease is in death.\r\n\r\nChronic glanders occasionally appears in man, and is in most respects\r\nthe counterpart of that of the horse. The morbid process shows itself\r\nin the integumental or other tissues of the body, and only attacks the\r\nnose and air-passages later, when the constitutional symptoms become\r\nmore intense. The general malaise, languor, prostration, aching of\r\n{922} limbs and joints, and inappetence are usually present,\r\ncomplicated by a local swelling in the seat of inoculation (face,\r\nhands, etc.), with small nodules progressing to pustules, congestion\r\nof the lymphatics, and swelling of the lymphatic glands. These lesions\r\nmay subside even before suppuration, and the disease is manifested for\r\na week or two only by a general feeling of weariness and ill-health;\r\nbut sooner or later the local symptoms reappear in the same or another\r\nseat, and the neoplasms, though indolent for an indefinite length of\r\ntime, finally degenerate, soften, burst, and form ulcers. These ulcers\r\nhave the general characters already described--a livid grayish or\r\nyellowish hue, with red, puffy, irregular edges, and a viscid\r\ngreenish, yellowish, dirty white, or bloody discharge. They tend to\r\nincrease, or they may appear to heal by the peculiar firm cicatricial\r\nformation, but on the swollen margins new deposits, abscesses, and\r\nulcers tend continually to form. Sometimes these are of considerable\r\nsize and seated deeply among the muscles, but when opened they show\r\nthe same unhealthy serous or bloody pus, and manifest a tendency to\r\nextension rather than to healing. When the disease extends to the\r\nrespiratory organs, often two or three months after the onset, there\r\nis cough and sore throat, blocking of the nose by the tenacious\r\ndischarges and swollen mucosa, and in the pharynx, fauces, and nose\r\nthe characteristic ulcer may be detected. The attendant constitutional\r\nsymptoms are also much more marked--indigestion, nausea, vomiting,\r\ndiarrhoea, rigors, profuse perspiration, high temperature, excited\r\nbreathing and pulse, a yellowish or earthy hue of the skin, rapid\r\nemaciation, and great prostration. Though great emaciation, debility,\r\nand hectic ensue on the indolent chronic processes, yet the disease\r\nusually assumes all the characters of the acute type before\r\nterminating fatally.\r\n\r\nIn cases that recover the fever diminishes, exacerbations cease,\r\nulcers granulate and cicatrize, vesicles dry up, the nodules and\r\nenlarged glands diminish, the erysipelatoid swellings of skin and nose\r\nsubside, and a very tardy and imperfect convalescence is established.\r\n\r\nThe duration of chronic glanders, nasal or cutaneous (farcy), is\r\nexceedingly indefinite, varying from three months to ten or eleven\r\nyears. One of the most protracted cases is that recorded by Bollinger\r\nof a veterinarian who, after an eleven years' illness, recovered with\r\ncicatricial contraction of the nose and larynx and a decided cachectic\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--Besides the lesions above mentioned as occurring in\r\nthe skin and mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and pharynx, the\r\nfrontal sinuses, the larynx, and less frequently the lungs, are the\r\nseats of the specific glanderous processes. In the lungs there are\r\nthen the nodules, hard, caseous, or purulent according to their age,\r\nand varying in size from a millet-seed and pea upward to the involving\r\nof the greater part of a lobe. Beneath the pleuræ may be seen\r\necchymoses, hard, fibrous nodules, and yellow elevations, which on\r\nbeing incised furnish grumous pus. The spleen is usually enlarged,\r\ngorged with blood, gray or black, and is the seat of suppuration. The\r\nliver is enlarged, softened, and may be the seat of glanderous\r\nprocesses, with ulcers in the bile-duct or gall-bladder. The joints,\r\nlike other serous cavities, become the seat of specific suppuration.\r\nThe bones are often implicated in adjacent deposits, especially in the\r\nface, cranium, and hands, so that the compact tissue may become\r\nreduced to the merest shell, while the medulla and periosteum {923}\r\nabound in the specific products. The cerebral meninges and\r\nbrain-tissue are frequently the seat of specific growths and minute\r\nabscesses. It is noticeable that the enlargement of the lymphatic\r\nglands is usually less than it is in the horse, though they are never\r\nentirely free from lesions. Indeed, the tendency in man to the\r\nformation of considerable glanderous neoplasms is much less than in\r\nthe solipede.\r\n\r\nThe microscopy of the lesions is essentially the same as in the horse.\r\nO. Wyss describes the cutaneous nodules as formed by a great\r\nproliferation of round cells (like pus-cells) in the upper layer of\r\nthe corium just beneath the papillary layer. In a more advanced stage\r\nthe corium and papillæ are filled with pus-cells, and, becoming\r\ndisorganized, give rise to the formation of pustules and small\r\nabscesses. Lagrange describes in a chronic ulcer of the palm, a layer\r\nabout 2 mm. in thickness of embryonic cells closely packed with an\r\namorphous intercellular substance. The nuclei appeared larger than in\r\nordinary ulcers or tubercles. Extending into this layer were capillary\r\nvessels packed with red globules and with blind extremities, or in\r\nsome instances minute ruptures and hemorrhages. Beneath this\r\nsuperficial cellular layer was a stratum of striated muscle,\r\nespecially noticeable for the excess of condensed connective tissue\r\nmaking up the intermuscular septa, and the great multiplication of\r\nnuclei with large, clearly-defined nucleoli, not only inside the\r\nsarcolemma, but also between the fibrillæ and separating them widely.\r\nAt some points the muscular tissue had undergone a vitreous\r\ndegeneration, while at others were many fusiform cells. At one point,\r\nwhere the ulcer extended to the phalanx, the compact layer of the bone\r\nwas attenuated to the thinnest shell and perforated, so that the\r\nmedulla was continuous with the ulcer. The medulla contained a great\r\nnumber of white globules, medulla-cells, and minute embryonic nuclei.\r\nThe vessels were remarkable by the extensive fibroid thickening of\r\ntheir coats. On section of the ulcer many orifices stood widely open\r\nbecause of the rigidity of their walls. The internal coat was\r\nplicated, as if too large for the lumen. The external fibrous layers\r\nwere at points abundantly interspersed with, and even replaced by,\r\ngroups of embryonic cells, the active proliferation of which meant the\r\ndestruction of the perivascular fibrous layer. These embryonic cells\r\neven invaded the lumen of the vessel and partly blocked it, so that\r\nthe remnant of the tube remained as the centre of a disintegrating\r\nmass, or later a caseous or purulent focus.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--Acute glanders, when well developed, is unmistakable. The\r\npresence on or near the skin of the characteristic nodules, pustules,\r\nphlyctenæ, and ulcers, the oedema or erysipelatoid condition of the\r\nadjacent skin, the redness of the lymphatics, the presence of the\r\nneoplasms and ulcers in the nose, and the sticky, fetid, variously\r\ncolored nasal discharge, with the acute fever, prostration, and pains\r\nin the limbs and joints, make a tout ensemble that is pathognomonic.\r\nIn the initial stage only it may be confounded with rheumatism, but\r\nthe arthritic pains are not usually attended by the same amount of\r\nredness and swelling of the joints, the prostration is far more\r\nprofound, and there are in most cases an irritable, unhealthy-looking\r\nwound and a history of exposure to infection from glandered horses.\r\n\r\nIn chronic glanders, and especially in the external form (farcy), the\r\ndiagnosis is often more difficult. From pyæmia and septicæmia it is\r\n{924} usually to be distinguished by the comparative absence or the\r\nslightness of the chills, by the less healthy character of the pus,\r\nand by the implication of the nasal mucosa, the larynx, and lungs.\r\nWhen the nose, larynx, or lungs are but slightly affected, there may\r\nbe a strong resemblance to syphilis or miliary tuberculosis, but a\r\nclose attention to the character of the lesions, the absence of any\r\nconcomitant history or symptoms of syphilis, and deductions drawn from\r\nthe occupation of the patient and the presumptive exposure, will\r\ngreatly assist in reaching a diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe detection of the bacillus is not conclusive, as in tuberculosis\r\nand some forms of septicæmia there are similar organisms, agreeing\r\nwith the microbe of glanders even in the matter of size. In cases of\r\ndoubt a little delay will usually allow the development of new and\r\nmore characteristic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe final resort, however, is to inoculation. Auto-inoculation, as\r\npractised by Poland, is rarely satisfactory, as the system has\r\nacquired a partial tolerance of the disease and local lesions are not\r\nso certainly developed as in the healthy subject (St. Cyr).\r\nInoculation on a healthy goat, sheep, or rabbit can always be availed\r\nof, and if practised on more than one subject can be relied upon, as\r\nthe virus loses nothing of its power in passing through the human\r\nsystem, but usually determines an acute form of the disease in the\r\nanimal inoculated.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--Acute glanders is almost constantly fatal to man. Of\r\nchronic cases, and especially the external form (farcy), from\r\none-third to one-half of the subjects recover. When both internal and\r\nexternal (farcy--glanders), the issue is usually fatal. Kütner claims\r\nthat cases caused by external inoculation are more favorable than\r\nthose caused by the inhaled poison. This accords with the general\r\nprinciple, that a poison viable in the comparatively vitiated air of\r\nthe lungs or on the surface of the intestinal canal is better fitted\r\nby its habit of life for survival in the blood and plasma, and is\r\nconsequently more redoubtable. The greater the duration of the disease\r\nin any particular case, the more favorable is the prognosis.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--In the treatment of glanders in man the same principles\r\nmust guide as in animals. In external, inoculated cases the wounded\r\ntissues should be early destroyed by potent caustics--fuming nitric\r\nacid, corrosive sublimate, iodized phenol, chlorine, sulphate of\r\ncopper, carbolic acid, or the hot iron. The erysipelatoid swellings\r\nmay be treated by leeching, followed by solutions of carbolic acid,\r\niodine, or chlorine-water, by ice, and internally by laxatives and\r\niodide of potassium. The first two antiseptics may be freely used by\r\nhypodermic injection. Abscesses and tumors should be laid open and\r\ncauterized as above, and then treated by weaker solutions of the same\r\nagents. Nasal ulcers may be treated by insufflation of iodoform and\r\ninjections of creasote, carbolic acid, nitrate of silver, or\r\npermanganate of potash solutions. Of the greatest importance is a\r\ngeneral tonic and stimulating regimen. A nutritious diet (including\r\nbeef-tea), abundance of pure air, alcoholic stimulants, quinia,\r\ntincture of the chloride of iron, and, above all, arseniate of\r\nstrychnia, have been used with advantage. Various anti-ferments, such\r\nas the bisulphites in full doses, carbolic acid, and iodide of\r\npotassium, have apparently proved beneficial, and deserve a further\r\ntrial. As in the horse, a great {925} variety of other agents, mostly\r\nof a tonic nature, have been employed, but with very variable results.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.--The first step toward the prevention of glanders in man\r\nis the systematic restriction and extinction of the affection in\r\nanimals. This has been already sufficiently referred to above. Further\r\nmeasures of prophylaxis embrace the following: the avoidance of\r\ncontact with glandered and suspected horses by all persons having any\r\nwounds, abrasions, or ulcers on their skins; the cauterization with\r\nnitrate of silver of all such sores on persons necessarily brought in\r\ncontact with glandered or suspected animals or their products; the\r\ngeneral diffusion of information as to the danger from glandered\r\nanimals; washing of hands and face in a solution of carbolic acid or\r\nchloride of lime after handling infected or suspected animals or their\r\ncarcases or products; the thorough disinfection or destruction\r\n(preferably by fire) of harness, clothing, racks, mangers,\r\nwagon-poles, buckets, troughs, brushes, combs, litter, and fodder that\r\nhave been exposed to infection; and, finally, the exclusion from the\r\nmarkets of all meat derived from suspected or infected animals. It is\r\ngenerally held that the flesh of the horse alone demands inspection,\r\nbut with the known susceptibility of sheep, goats, and rabbits it can\r\neasily be conceived how the infection may reach man through his food,\r\nthough horse-flesh is never consumed. That glanders has never been\r\nrecognized as arising from the consumption of diseased sheep or\r\nrabbits does not prove that it has never reached man by this channel,\r\nany more than the absence of all recognition of the infection of man\r\nfrom the horse would prove the non-occurrence of such infection until\r\nthe beginning of the present century. The knowledge that the animals\r\nused for food in this country are liable to contract and convey this\r\ndisease is an additional reason for the systematic and universal\r\nsuppression of the disease among the equine population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{926}\r\n\r\nANTHRAX (MALIGNANT PUSTULE).\r\n\r\nBY JAMES LAW, F.R.C.V.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNONYMS.--_Latin_, Ignis Sacer, Anthrax Epizoöticus, Pustula Maligna,\r\nPustula Pestifera, Erysipelas Carbunculosum, Carbunculo Contagioso,\r\nGlossanthrax, Angina Carbunculosa, Anthrax Hæmorrhoidalis, Mycosis\r\nIntestinalis, Apoplexia Splenitis, etc. _English_, Black Erysipelas,\r\nMalignant Vesicle, Anthrax Fever, Splenic Apoplexy, Splenic Fever,\r\nInflammatory Fever, Carbuncular Fever, Black Quarter, Blood-Striking,\r\nBloody Murrain, Blain, etc. _French_, Pustule maligne, Charbon, Fièvre\r\nputride, Typhohémie, Pélohémie, Mal de Rate, Splenite Gangréneusé,\r\netc. _German_, Karbunkelkrankheit, Contagiose Karbunkel, Milzbrand,\r\nMilzseuche, Milzbrandfieber, Brandbeulenseuche, Rothlauf, etc.\r\n_Russian_, Jaswa (boil-plague). _Italian_, Antrace. _Spanish_,\r\nCarbunculo, Lobado. _Swedish_, Boskapssjukan. _Mexican_, Calentura del\r\npiojo.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Anthrax is an acute, infectious, bacteridian disease,\r\noccurring mostly in the Herbivora and Omnivora, but communicable to\r\nother mammals (including man), to birds, and even fishes. Its local\r\nmanifestations are exceedingly varied in kind, but the malady is\r\ncharacterized by the presence in the tissues or blood, or both, of\r\nspecific spherical and linear bacteria (micrococcus and bacillus\r\nanthracis), leading to arrest of hæmatosis, to disintegration of the\r\nblood-globules, to sanguineous engorgement of the spleen, to capillary\r\nembolism, and to a spreading gangrenous inflammation.\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--While ancient history is not\r\nclear as to the specific diseases of animals, yet there is the\r\nstrongest presumption that nearly all great plagues that attacked\r\nindiscriminately animals and man were of this nature. Thus, the plague\r\nof murrain, with boils and blains breaking out on man and beast, in\r\nthe days of Moses, was probably of this kind (Gen. ix. 3.); also that\r\nwhich at the siege of Troy extended from animals to man, and many\r\nlater epizoötics in all parts of the world. No infectious disease of\r\nman and animals, with the single exception of tuberculosis, has been\r\nmore widely diffused, and none can be considered as more cosmopolitan.\r\nHeusinger, in his classic work on _Milzbrandkrankheit_, traces the\r\nravages of the disease from the highest to the lowest latitudes in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres and in the Old World and the New. He\r\nadduces outbreaks in Siberia, Astrakan, Lapland, and Finland, in\r\nRussia, Prussia, Poland, Silesia, Bavaria, Holland, Belgium, France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Turkey,\r\nEgypt, East and West Indies, {927} North and South America, etc. We\r\ncan now add all the great English, French, and other European colonies\r\nnot included in the above (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,\r\nAlgeria, etc.), together with China and Japan. We find, moreover, that\r\nthe disease is always most prevalent where agriculture is in its most\r\nprimitive condition, so that there can be little doubt of the\r\nprevalence of the affection in the less-civilized countries as well.\r\nBut while the disease is prevalent in all parts of the world, its\r\nravages are largely subordinate to the nature of the soil. Wherever\r\nthis is close, impervious, marshy, or charged with an excess of\r\norganic matters, the gaseous emanations of which drive out most of the\r\noxygen, the anthrax-germs, once introduced, tend to be preserved\r\nindefinitely. Thus, in drying up basins with no natural drainage, on\r\nlake and river margins, on deltas, in forests, in mucky, mossy, or\r\npeaty soils, and on those that are habitually over-manured, the germs\r\nof anthrax are especially liable to be perpetuated. It has long been\r\nnoticed that herbivorous animals are the most susceptible to anthrax,\r\nwhile the purely carnivorous, and to a less extent the omnivorous,\r\nhave relatively a far higher resisting power. That the immunity is\r\nlargely due to the food is manifest from the experiments of Feser on\r\nrats. Those fed on vegetable aliment contracted anthrax readily from\r\ninoculation, while those kept on an exclusive diet of flesh\r\nsuccessfully resisted. The same rats that escaped while on a flesh\r\ndiet were afterward placed on a vegetable diet, and then perished\r\nafter inoculation.[1] Davaine found the same to be true of foxes kept\r\non meat and vegetables respectively, and inoculated with the virulent\r\nblood of the allied disease, septicæmia. He found, moreover, that\r\nguinea-pigs were much more susceptible to anthrax than rabbits.\r\nOne-thousandth of a drop of virulent anthrax blood invariably killed\r\nthe guinea-pig, while it left the rabbit unharmed.[2] Klein has never\r\nfound a rabbit insusceptible. It has recently been claimed that pigs\r\nare insusceptible, but I have known of many instances in which the\r\noffal of anthrax cattle, when devoured by pigs, has determined fatal\r\nanthrax in the latter. Chickens too prove much less susceptible to\r\nanthrax than the Herbivora. Inoculations made by Cohn and others\r\nproved invariably unsuccessful, while Pasteur has showed that they can\r\nbe infected easily after the body has been cooled by partial immersion\r\nin cold water.[3] Pasteur attributes this immunity to their normally\r\nhigh temperature, yet rabbits, sheep, pigs, wolves, and foxes, though\r\nmaintaining a correspondingly high temperature, are still subject to\r\nanthrax. Even the herbivorous mammal suffering from acute anthrax\r\nfever has its temperature raised to that of the chicken, yet the\r\ndisease progresses none the less surely to a fatal result. Again,\r\nanthrax liquids inoculated under the skin of a fox proved harmless,\r\nwhile if thrown into the warmer peritoneal cavity they proved fatal.\r\nIt may well be suspected that the relative insusceptibility of\r\nchickens is in part due to the large amount of animal food consumed by\r\nthem, and that the chilling process increases the receptivity by\r\nderanging sanguinification and nutrition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Wochenschrift f. Thierheilkunde und Thiersucht_, Nos. 24\r\nand 25, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rec. de Med. Vet._, Mar. 15, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, Mar. 15, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThe insusceptibility to anthrax is often characteristic of certain\r\nindividuals or families or of the animals living in a particular\r\ndistrict. Thus, Chauveau found that some French sheep, and nearly all\r\nAlgerian ones, {928} resisted inoculation with a moderate amount of\r\nanthrax virus, while the introduction of a maximum amount proved fatal\r\nto these as to others. In the same way, it is often noticed that\r\nanimals living in an anthrax region escape the evil effects of the\r\npoison, while strange animals brought in either fall ready victims or\r\nfor a time do badly until they have become habituated to the locality.\r\nIn view of the subsequent protective effect on the system of a first\r\nand non-fatal attack of anthrax, it is probable that all these\r\nexamples of immunity in the Herbivora depend on a previous mild attack\r\nof the same disease or on the extinction of the more susceptible\r\nraces. Even in the case of the animals that do badly on first coming\r\ninto an anthrax district, and recover better health with immunity\r\nlater, we may well infer that a mild form of the anthrax infection has\r\nbeen passed through.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--The one essential cause of anthrax is the introduction into\r\nthe system of a specific bacteridian germ (bacillus anthracis or its\r\nspores). This is not, as a rule, carried far on the atmosphere, but\r\ndemands for its propagation contagion, immediate or mediate. Unless,\r\ntherefore, it meets in the soil the conditions necessary to the\r\npreservation and propagation of the germ, it is transmitted with some\r\nuncertainty from animal to animal, and thus the disease does not\r\nspread widely and rapidly, like an ordinary plague, but tends to\r\nbecome localized in particular districts as an enzoötic.\r\n\r\nBut its dangers are none the less real nor its existence less to be\r\ndreaded. In predisposed localities, where the disease-germ has gained\r\na footing, the animal mortality may exceed that caused by the great\r\nplagues, while the risk to human beings is incomparably greater than\r\nfrom any other acute infectious disease of the lower animals. Thus, in\r\nSan Domingo, in 1770, 15,000 people perished in six weeks from eating\r\nthe carcases of anthrax animals, and the mortality was only arrested\r\nwhen the meat was legally interdicted. In the worst anthrax years on\r\nsome of the Siberian steppes as many as one-fourth of the whole human\r\npopulation suffer from the malady. The prevalence and death-rate,\r\nhowever, vary greatly in different localities and seasons. Sometimes\r\nonly one or two solitary cases of the affection are observed; at other\r\ntimes the disease becomes moderately prevalent, but a lack of\r\nvirulence in the poison or a previously acquired insusceptibility of\r\nthe individual protects the great majority of the animals exposed,\r\nwhile at others, still, the poison attacks nearly all exposed to its\r\ncontagion.\r\n\r\nThe animal products that mainly convey the disease are the blood, the\r\nliquid exudations, portions of the diseased carcase, and the bowel\r\ndejections. The virus is most potent when derived from an animal still\r\nliving or only recently dead, yet under certain conditions (with\r\nspore-formation) it may long retain its virulence under the most\r\nextreme changes of climate, temperature, dryness, and humidity.\r\nRussian hides tanned in England or America frequently convey anthrax,\r\nwhich is known especially as a tanner's malady, and wool and hair sent\r\nfrom Buenos Ayres have repeatedly produced malignant pustule\r\n(woolsorter's disease) in Britain and the United States. The preserved\r\nscabs of malignant pustule have been often successfully inoculated on\r\nthe lower animals, so that, like other forms of poison, this seems to\r\nbe preserved indefinitely by desiccation.\r\n\r\nThe simple contact of the virus with the slightest abrasion will\r\nsuffice {929} to convey the disease. It has often been communicated\r\nwhere no lesion of the epidermis could be found, yet the presumption\r\nis that even in such cases the cuticle had been in some way wounded.\r\nEating the flesh of animals killed while suffering from anthrax has\r\noften conveyed the disease. In an outbreak in Swineshead,\r\nLincolnshire, England, in 1863, I found a dog and a number of swine\r\nsuffering from eating the bodies of dead bullocks. In 1864 an East\r\nLothian (Scotland) farmer fed his pigs with the offal of a slaughtered\r\nanthrax bullock, and lost nearly the whole herd. The carcase of the\r\nbullock had been sent to market. About 1860 cattle, and even horses,\r\ndied yearly on a swampy meadow at Brighton, Mass. On one occasion the\r\nowner, John Zoller, fed the offal of a dead bullock to his pigs, which\r\nwere speedily attacked with anthrax, and as speedily killed to save\r\ntheir bacon (Dr. Thayer). Even when cooked the flesh is not always\r\nsafe. Of this we have the undoubted case in San Domingo above noticed,\r\nthe alleged death of 60,000 people in the vicinity of Naples from the\r\nsame cause in 1617 (Kircher), and the thousands that die on the\r\nRussian steppes every anthrax year from eating the sick horses\r\n(Rawitch). But in all these, and in the ever-recurring cases in which\r\nfamilies suffer from eating anthrax meat, there is the possibility, if\r\nnot the probability, of the contamination of the meat subsequently to\r\ncooking by the knives, forks, tables, and dishes used. The San Domingo\r\nslaves had few appliances for cleanliness, much less disinfection, and\r\nthe Tartars eat their meat from the same board on which it has been\r\nchopped up raw.\r\n\r\nIn accurate experiments it has been found that the bacilli are\r\ndestroyed by a temperature of 145° F. maintained for five minutes, but\r\nthe spores are capable of surviving the boiling temperature for five\r\nor even ten minutes. The varying power of resistance may be compared\r\nto that of the green stalk of the pea and the dry flinty seed. The\r\nfirst is destroyed by a very moderate heat, while the second will\r\nsprout after having had boiling water poured over it. The resisting\r\nbacillus-spores are never found in the living animal, but may be\r\ndeveloped in the blood and tissues after death, and may account for\r\nthe occasional extraordinary viability of the poison when exposed to a\r\nboiling temperature.\r\n\r\nMilk, though often used with impunity, conveyed the disease when\r\ninoculated by Bollinger, and the same was true of the vaginal mucus.\r\nInnocent in the early stages of the disease while the germs are still\r\nlocalized, they become virulent after the bacilli swarm into the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHealthy men and animals often carry the poison, though themselves\r\ninsusceptible. The question of its conveyance by insects has been much\r\ndebated, but the constant occurrence of malignant pustule on the\r\nuncovered parts of the body goes far to settle the question. Bourgeois\r\nlong ago noticed that it was most frequent on the face, hands, neck,\r\nand arms, and rare on the trunk. In sixty cases recorded by A. W. Bell\r\nof Brooklyn, all occurred on the face except two on the hands, one on\r\nthe wrist, and one on the forearm. The bite of a fly or mosquito had\r\nin many of these cases proved the starting-point of the malady.\r\nBollinger has shown the presence of the bacillus in the stomach of\r\nsuch flies as fed on flesh and blood (horse-flies, bluebottles, etc.),\r\nand, together with Raimbert and Davaine, has produced anthrax by\r\ninoculations with the stomachs, legs, and proboscides of these\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n{930} Surgical instruments occasionally convey anthrax. At\r\nCockburnspath, East Lothian, Scotland, a yearling heifer contracted\r\nanthrax, and the whole herd was bled, commencing with the sick one.\r\nNext morning seven were found dead, the disease in each case extending\r\naround the fleam-wound. At Brunt, in the same county, a shepherd\r\nskinned an anthrax bullock, and after washing and taking a turn among\r\nhis sheep, on the same day castrated several litters of pigs, all of\r\nwhich perished. In St. Lawrence Co., N.Y., in 1870, a surgeon\r\ninoculated himself while opening a vesicle on the hand of a farmer.\r\n\r\nHarness, stables, stable utensils, vehicles, fodder, and litter are\r\nfrequent bearers of contagion. At Geneseo, N.Y., in 1877, three horses\r\nand a cat died in midwinter after licking the blood from a stone-boat\r\nwhich had conveyed the skin of an anthrax bullock to market. Green\r\nfodder or hay harvested from ground formerly occupied by anthrax\r\nvictims or from their graves often convey the poison, but probably\r\nonly by the adherent earth and dust containing the anthrax-germ.\r\n\r\nThat the anthrax bacillus and its spores may be long preserved in\r\nearth is abundantly proved. At Avon, N.Y., nine months after any cases\r\nof the disease, the liquid leaking out on the river-bank near to the\r\ngrave of a victim of the year before was licked by six cattle, and in\r\ntwo days they all perished. On the same pasture victims were seized\r\nyearly for seven years, but with a rigid seclusion of these, their\r\nproducts, and their graves the malady has finally disappeared. The\r\npersistent deadly effect of some soils on animal life, apart from the\r\npresence of the carcases, seems to show that in certain soils we find\r\nthe normal home of the anthrax bacillus, while the migration into the\r\nanimal economy is but an accident of its existence. The soils that are\r\nespecially subject to anthrax are the dense clays, the limestones, and\r\nthe rich alluvials. Among the essential conditions are the exclusion\r\nof oxygen, excepting a limited amount bearing some relation to what is\r\nfound in the animal fluids, and the abundance of some alkaline agent\r\n(lime, potash, soda, ammonia), so that the earth is either neutral or\r\nonly very slightly alkaline or acid. An acid vegetable infusion is\r\ninimical to the germ, which soon disappears from such a medium. The\r\nrequisite paucity of air is found in all the dense, less pervious\r\nsoils (clays, etc.), in soils habitually waterlogged (swamps, deltas,\r\nriver-bottoms, low meadows, natural basins, drying lakes and ponds),\r\nand in soils rich in decomposing organic matter (peat, alluvial,\r\nover-manured). The antacid is often found present as lime or potash,\r\nor is constantly being produced in the form of ammonia, etc. by\r\norganic decomposition. Such places are known to farmers as \"dead\r\nlots,\" because no stock will live on them. The bacillus in the buried\r\ncarcase does not produce spores (Bollinger), though it may in the soil\r\nat any temperature between 59° and 110° F. In the graves, therefore,\r\nat a lower temperature, the poison can only be preserved by a\r\ncontinuous generation of the bacillus.\r\n\r\nPasteur, who successfully inoculated the casts of earth-worms taken\r\nfrom anthrax graves, attributes to these an important rôle in bringing\r\nthe germs to the surface. A more important agent, however, is probably\r\nthe rise and fall of water in the soil. By this means the bacilli and\r\nspores are washed up toward the surface, and when the superficial\r\nlayers dry out they are easily carried by the winds. Hence it is that\r\nanthrax is usually prevalent in late summer and when the soil is dried\r\nand heated to its {931} greatest depth. Thus it is, too, that wet\r\nseasons followed by specially dry and hot ones are, above all,\r\nproductive of anthrax in herds. Wet seasons fulfil the further purpose\r\nof carrying off the germs into rivers and depositing them on the banks\r\nor on inundated meadows, where after the subsidence of the flood the\r\ndisease appears, for the first time perhaps.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, good reason to believe that the effect of a warm\r\nseason is not confined to its influence on the soil and its germs. The\r\nhigh temperature deranges the vital functions of the animal economy,\r\nand, inducing a febrile disturbance, lessens the power of resistance\r\nto the anthrax virus, just as the cooling of the warm-blooded bird\r\nlays it open to infection. On this account, and because of the\r\nfrequently recurring electric storms, the hot dry season is especially\r\nthe season of anthrax. The hottest, driest autumns of Siberia always\r\ncoincide with the anthrax years, and in the last fifteen years in the\r\nUnited States I have noticed the wide extension of anthrax whenever\r\nthe season has been unusually hot and dry. In Corsica the herdsmen\r\nconfidently pasture their stock in the close still valleys throughout\r\nspring and early summer, but whenever the surface soil is dried out\r\nthey make all haste to remove it to the hills, well knowing that delay\r\nmeans devastation and ruin.\r\n\r\nPlethora is undoubtedly an important predisposing cause of anthrax,\r\nand so is the alternation of cold nights with hot days. The febrile\r\ncondition induced in the animal economy is perhaps the main factor at\r\nwork in each case. Finally, youth is on the whole more liable than\r\nage, but whether because of the greater receptivity of the growing\r\nsystem and its tissues, or because it has not yet acquired some\r\nimmunity by exposure to the milder effects of the poison, is not\r\ncertainly determined. Sex is without influence.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that the bacillus germ has not yet been\r\nfound in the placental liquids nor foetal blood of sheep, goats, or\r\nrabbits, though swarming in that of the mother. Bollinger attributes\r\nthis to the action of the placenta as a \"physiological filter\"--a\r\nconclusion seemingly at variance with the passage of the bacillus\r\nthrough all the other animal membranes, including those lining the\r\nmammary glands and the vagina. Two other possible explanations remain:\r\nfirst, that the secretions of the uterine glands are inimical to the\r\nbacillus; and, second, that the foetus, being in some sense a\r\ncarnivorous animal, possesses the immunity characteristic of\r\nCarnivora. Bacilli have recently been found in the foetal guinea-pig.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus anthracis was first observed by Pollender and Branel in\r\n1849 (Birch-Hirschfeld), but it was only publicly claimed as the cause\r\nof the disease in 1855 by Davaine. Branel discarded Davaine's theory,\r\nbecause blood in which he had failed to find bacillus produced anthrax\r\nwith bacillus in the blood of two foals inoculated. Later observations\r\nby Bollinger and others have shown that cultures of bacillus can\r\nalways be made from such infecting blood, and that in most cases the\r\npresence in the infecting blood of spherical bacteria can be\r\ndemonstrated by the microscope. That the bacillus is the true\r\npathogenic element is proved by the following facts: 1st. That the\r\nbacillus is the only ectogenous, particulate, organized structure\r\nconstantly found in the anthrax blood and fluids; in cases in which it\r\nis apparently absent cultures show its actual presence. 2d. After\r\ncultivation in pork or beef infusion to the {932} hundredth generation\r\nthe virulence is unimpaired, though it must be assumed that all\r\nnon-organized poisons derived from the infected animal body must have\r\nbeen diluted or decomposed to extinction. 3d. That filtration of the\r\nanthrax liquids through a plaster or other efficient filter renders\r\nthe filtrate innocuous, while the solids retained in the filter remain\r\ninfecting (Chauveau, Bert, Toussaint). 4th. That the clear filtrate\r\ninjected to excess killed by virtue of its contained chemical products\r\nin twelve hours, while the solids filtered out and containing the\r\nbacillus or its spores only killed after thirty hours.[4] 5th. Anthrax\r\nblood from the living animal or one just dead, and destitute of\r\nspores, when subjected to compressed oxygen (50 atmospheres), is\r\nnon-infecting (Bert). 6th. The same anthrax liquid, destitute of\r\nspores, after boiling is completely innocuous. 7th. The same liquid,\r\nif kept in a closed tube apart from oxygen for eight days, shows the\r\nbacilli broken down by granular degeneration, and proves absolutely\r\nharmless when inoculated in small quantity. 8th. The same sporeless\r\nanthrax fluid when treated with absolute alcohol loses its virulence.\r\n9th. The anthrax liquid which has been cultivated with free access of\r\nair in a temperature varying from 25° C. (77° F.) (Klein, Löffler) to\r\n41° C. (105.5° F.) forms spores, and then remains infecting, though it\r\nmay have been subjected to compressed oxygen, boiling for several\r\nminutes, absolute alcohol, dilution with water, putrefaction, or the\r\nexclusion of oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Bert, _Compt. Rend. de la Société Biol._, p. 355, 1879.]\r\n\r\nThe bacillus anthracis, as found in the blood and animal fluids, is in\r\nthe form of fine rods, straight (rarely bent or angular), motionless,\r\nand 0.007 to 0.012 Mm. in length. Smaller forms are seen to be minute\r\novoid or oblong bodies, and the smallest absolutely spherical\r\n(micrococcus); but in all cases, as seen under the highest powers of\r\nthe microscope, they have clear-cut, even margins, linear or curved,\r\nwhich easily distinguish them from the irregular normal granules of\r\nthe blood and tissues. Under the highest powers of the microscope the\r\nbacillus is seen to be made up of a series of oblong (Koch) or cubical\r\n(Klein) cells enclosed in one common sheath. This is rendered more\r\nmanifest if they are first swollen by the addition of water. The\r\nmotionless form of the anthrax bacillus is of especial value in\r\ndistinguishing it from the motile bacteria of putrefaction\r\n(saprophytes).\r\n\r\nWithin the living animal body the development never goes aside from\r\nthese forms. The growth appears limited to micrococcus and bacillus\r\nrods, while spores or bacillus threads are never found. This finds its\r\ncounterpart in the micrococcus poisoning caused by the inoculation\r\nwith the spores of common moulds (Grawitz); and in septicæmia also\r\nmicrococcus and bacillus forms only are found, the filamentous never.\r\n\r\nWhen grown in organic infusions out of the animal body the\r\nanthrax-germ develops from micrococcus or bacillus into a long,\r\nbranching, filamentous product, which in the presence of oxygen\r\ndevelops into spores. Apart from oxygen or when the proper nourishment\r\nof the bacillus is exhausted the protoplasmic elements within the\r\nfilamentous sheath undergo granular degeneration, and finally the\r\nempty envelope disintegrates and disappears. The spores appear at\r\nintervals in the protoplasm of the filament as clear, brightly\r\nrefrangent bodies, at first spheroidal, afterward larger and oblong.\r\nUnlike the micrococcus and bacillus, {933} they do not stain. Under\r\nfavorable circumstances the primary cell is capable of forming one, or\r\nif extra long, two spores (Koch, Klein). Cossar-Ewart claims to have\r\nseen the formation of motile flagellate organisms aggregating\r\nthemselves into zooglæa masses, but as these were not found in the\r\ncarefully-conducted cultures of Koch and Klein, they are supposed to\r\nhave been aërial microphytes accidentally introduced.\r\n\r\nThe great tenacity of life in the spores in heat and cold, dryness and\r\nwet, excluded from air and under several atmospheres of oxygen, in the\r\nmidst of putrefaction and in pure watery fluids, well accounts for the\r\npersistence of infection in buildings and localities where the poison\r\nhas gained a foothold. In order to their destruction in a natural\r\nmanner it seems necessary that they should germinate and develop into\r\nthe anthrax micrococcus, bacillus, or mycelium. This germination may\r\ntake place in the presence of moisture, oxygen, and suitable\r\nnourishment, whether in the soil, the animal body, or elsewhere, and\r\nthen the exhaustion of the aliment, the exclusion of the oxygen by\r\nputrefaction, the submergence in a medium unfavorable to development,\r\nor exposure to a very high temperature, may suddenly destroy the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that a too free exposure to oxygen proves\r\ndestructive to the virulence, if not to the life, of the poison, and\r\nthus in all porous, well-drained soils the anthrax poison, even when\r\nintroduced from without and concentrated by the death and burial of\r\nmany victims, soon disappears. This feature, which is common to many\r\nzymotic diseases the germs of which live and multiply outside the\r\nanimal body (typhoid, yellow fever, tuberculosis, swine plague,\r\nchicken cholera, diphtheria, etc.), offers countenance to the claims\r\nof Buchner that he had by prolonged culture, in the presence of air,\r\nmetamorphosed the bacillus anthracis into a harmless mycrophyte, and\r\nthat, conversely, by continuous cultivation under the surface of a\r\nsuitable beef infusion he had changed the harmless bacillus subtilis\r\nof hay into the deadly bacillus anthracis. Koch, Klein, and others\r\nhave discredited Buchner's results, on the ground that he had not, in\r\ntheir opinion, taken due precautions against impure cultures, and that\r\nhis alleged transitions took place too abruptly; yet further\r\nobservation must determine whether he has been condemned too hastily.\r\nThe diminished virulence of Pasteur's attenuated virus, which is\r\nunaffected by the next subsequent culture or by the formation of\r\nspores, shows plainly enough that the bacillus anthracis is capable of\r\nphysiological changes under the influence of varying conditions of\r\ngrowth, and that such changes are not at once undone by a return of\r\nthe former conditions.\r\n\r\nHow anthrax-germs enter the body is partly known and partly\r\nconjectured. Direct inoculation on a sore by contact, by insects, by\r\nharness, by accidents, etc. is an undoubted method. The sound cuticle\r\nis probably an efficient barrier, since bacteria habitually inhabit,\r\nwithout hurt, the surface and gland-ducts of the skin; yet the\r\nentrance of these saprophytes through the shell and membranes of the\r\negg leaves a doubt as to the efficiency of the cuticular obstacle. The\r\nmucous membranes are manifestly frequently penetrated by the parasite.\r\nHence the local affections in the mouth and throat (glossanthrax,\r\nanthrax angina) and in the lungs (pulmonary anthrax). Cohn claims that\r\nthe gastric juice of Carnivora especially is destructive to the\r\nanthrax poison, yet the constant recurrence of intestinal anthrax\r\n(mycosis) seems to imply that the germs often escape destruction {934}\r\nin the stomach. Pasteur supposes that anthrax-infected food is only\r\ninjurious when there are inoculable sores in the mouth or pharynx, but\r\nit seems as if in that case the disease would be first shown at these\r\npoints and in the nearest lymphatic glands rather than in the bowels,\r\nthe rule for the inoculated anthrax being to develop first in the\r\ntissues and thence to reach the blood-vessels through the lymphatics.\r\n\r\nThe anthrax poison expends its fatal energy especially on the blood\r\nand blood-vessels. The bacilli in the blood use up the available\r\noxygen, so that the circulating liquid becomes venous, dark, and\r\nunfitted for the maintenance of the normal functions of life. What is\r\neven worse, the ability of the blood to absorb oxygen is greatly\r\nimpaired. In men and dogs suffering from anthrax the consumption of\r\noxygen was found to be reduced in one instance even by two-thirds,\r\nprobably in part by reason of the action of the chemical products of\r\nthe bacillus. A third condition constantly found is embolism of the\r\ncapillaries by the bacillus and the occurrence of local gangrene.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Anthrax shows itself in three principal forms: 1st, the\r\napoplectiform; 2d, anthrax fever without local external lesions; and\r\n3d, external localized anthrax. The two last forms correspond in the\r\nmain to the acute and subacute forms.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation varies according to the dose of the poison\r\nand the receptivity of the animal. In some cases infection is at once\r\nfollowed by illness. In these it is probably the chemical products\r\nthat produce the first effect, while the disease caused by the\r\npropagation of the bacillus appears later should the animal survive.\r\nSuch incubation is shortest for the smaller animals (mice, rabbits,\r\nguinea-pigs, cats), in which illness usually sets in in from\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours. In sheep and goats incubation may be\r\nextended to three or four days, while in horses and cattle it may last\r\na day longer.\r\n\r\nThe apoplectiform type attacks animals which a few minutes before\r\nseemed in fine health, appetite, and spirits, striking them down as if\r\nby lightning, and the victims struggle convulsively for some minutes,\r\nexpel blood perhaps by the nose or anus, and expire. In the less\r\nsuddenly fatal cases there may be muscular trembling, unsteady gait,\r\nexcited breathing, accelerated pulse, tumultuous heart's action,\r\nbleeding from some natural orifice, and death in from one to several\r\nhours. Occurring as these cases often do in summer, the sudden death\r\nis probably hastened by insolation.\r\n\r\nIn anthrax fever or acute internal anthrax there is loss of appetite,\r\nand, in ruminants, of rumination, suppression of milk, dulness,\r\nlanguor, staring coat, or even a rigor, and thirst. Then follows the\r\nhot stage, in which the temperature may rise to 106° or 107° F.; there\r\nare acceleration of pulse and breathing, petechiæ or a brown or\r\nyellowish tinge of the mucous membranes and white parts of the skin,\r\ntenderness of the spine, often jerking or clonic spasms of the muscles\r\nof the extremities, and much prostration and weakness, the patient\r\nhanging back on the halter, leaning against a wall, or swaying when\r\nmade to move. The feces are usually more or less mingled with\r\nblood-clots, or may be at once liquid and bloody. Bloody urine and the\r\ndischarge of blood from other natural channels are frequent. Some\r\ncases are manifestly delirious, and in others the skin crackles on\r\nbeing handled. Remissions are not uncommon, {935} during which the\r\nanimal remains dull and prostrate. As the disease advances and the\r\nblood is robbed of its oxygen, the temperature descends below the\r\nnatural standard, great weakness and stupor set in, the pupils are\r\nwidely dilated, and death from asphyxia occurs in one or two days from\r\nthe onset.\r\n\r\nIn localized external anthrax the local swellings may be first seen.\r\nThere are usually some tenderness of the skin, erection of the hair,\r\nand the formation of a little nodule, like a hazel-nut or walnut,\r\nadherent to the deeper parts of the skin, firm and comparatively\r\npainless even when cut. Sometimes the swelling is diffuse, with a\r\ndropsical or erysipelatoid aspect, and crackles like parchment when\r\nhandled. Whether the affection attacks the tongue, the throat, or some\r\npart of the head, body, or limbs, the tendency is to gangrene of the\r\npart, and, if the subject survives long enough, to an extensive\r\nsloughing and unhealthy sore. The sloughs and sores have either a\r\nblack sanguineous appearance or they are lardaceous and intermixed\r\nwith streaks of dark red. If fever is not present at the outset, it\r\nsets in early, and passes through the same stages as in the acute\r\ninternal anthrax, the animals being suddenly plunged in prostration\r\nand stupor, with dusky yellow or blood-stained mucous membranes,\r\ndyspnoea, dilated pupils, convulsions, and death. On the mucous\r\nmembranes (gloss-anthrax, anthrax angina) the engorgement is usually\r\ncomplicated with bullæ with red or yellow contents, and which on\r\nbursting leave unsightly gangrenous ulcers. In all such cases the\r\nmorbid liquids of the swellings teem with bacilli.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The most characteristic changes are usually met with\r\nin the blood. This is black, thick, tarry, uncoagulable or coagulates\r\nonly in loose diffluent clots, which are redissolved before squeezing\r\nout the serum; the fibrin is diminished (often by two-thirds), the red\r\nglobules are not adherent in rouleaux, and are crenated and broken\r\ndown and the hæmatin diffused through the liquid, so that it stains\r\nthe hands or paper deeply; the white globules are increased, probably\r\nby reason of the early irritation of the lymphatic glands and spleen\r\nby the poison; and it reddens slowly and but slightly on exposure to\r\nthe air, and speedily passes into decomposition. The blood can\r\nscarcely be made to flow in a full stream, but often trickles down the\r\nhair and skin by reason of its thick, consistent character. The\r\nmicrophytes above described are usually found in the blood, and always\r\nin the affected tissues if examined just after death.\r\n\r\nNext to the blood, the spleen presents the most constant lesions,\r\nbeing enlarged (by one-third, one-half, or to double, triple or\r\nquadruple its normal size) and gorged with blood (sometimes even to\r\nrupture). The lymphatic glands, and especially those adjoining the\r\nlocal anthrax swellings of the tissues, are always enlarged, marked\r\nwith petechiæ, friable, easily reduced to a pulp, and swarming with\r\nbacilli and micrococci. Next to the glands of the affected parts the\r\ncentral ones, the axillary, prepectoral, thoracic, sublumbar, and\r\nabdominal, are the most constantly affected. The lymph is reddish and\r\nopaque.\r\n\r\nDecomposition sets in early, and the resulting gases cause a puffy,\r\nemphysematous condition of the connective tissue. The fat and other\r\nwhite tissues are dusky brown or yellow, and petechiated; the muscles\r\nare soft, flabby, and dark red or brown, with occasional blood {936}\r\nextravasations; the blood-vessels, especially the veins, and the right\r\nheart are gorged with black, uncoagulable blood, and have their inner\r\ncoats blood-stained. The serous membranes present numerous petechiæ,\r\nand contain more or less of a reddish serum. The intestines, and\r\nsometimes the stomach, are dark red throughout, marked by petechiæ,\r\nand are often the seat of thickening from sanguineous or transparent\r\ncolloid infiltration. The lesions are especially extensive on the\r\nsmall intestines and rectum. The vagina and womb are also the frequent\r\nseats of sanguineous infiltration. The liver and kidneys are enlarged,\r\ncongested, softened, and friable, and the ganglia of the sympathetic\r\nare enlarged, congested, and softened. The swellings are of two kinds,\r\nsanguineous and colloid. The former, when cut into, present one or\r\nmore loose clots of black blood or a grumous mass of blood-elements,\r\nseparating the tissues and often mixed with fetid gases. The colloid\r\nexudations are glairy, semi-solid, jelly-like masses, infiltrating the\r\ntissues. The tissues affected and the skin covering them are the seat\r\nof bacterial embolism and gangrene, and there is no tendency to\r\nsuppuration. These products swarm with the specific microphytæ.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--The differential diagnosis of anthrax from other\r\naffections due to the propagation of microzymes in the system is not\r\nalways easy--so much so that a variety of bacteridian and allied\r\ndiseases (septicæmia in its various forms, erysipelas, swine plague,\r\nchicken cholera, poisoning by the micrococci of fungi, black quarter\r\nfrom bacteria, milk sickness, and Texas fever) have been erroneously\r\nconfounded with this affection. These all show the same dusky or\r\ncyanosed mucous membranes, disintegrating blood-globules, loose\r\nblood-clots, petechiæ, blood-extravasations, sudden and great\r\nprostration, and enlargement and congestion of the lymphatic glands or\r\nspleen. In some of these the duration of incubation (in swine plague\r\nsix to fourteen days and in Texas fever one month) serves to\r\ndistinguish, while in the majority the microzyme is globular (Texas\r\nfever, micrococcus of fungi-poisoning, chicken cholera); in swine\r\nplague the cocci are arranged in pairs; in black quarter the microbe\r\nis a refrangent ovoid, single or in chains of two or three and a\r\nmotile linear body with a refrangent nucleus in one end; and in milk\r\nsickness the germ is a spirillum. The germs are far more likely to be\r\ndetected in the local lesions and lymphatic glands than in the blood.\r\nThe specific nature of the symptoms and lesions can usually be relied\r\non, but in cases of doubt the inoculation of a small animal (rabbit,\r\nguinea-pig, sheep) will be a material guide.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--True anthrax leads to a very high mortality. The\r\napoplectiform cases are fatal almost without exception; the acute\r\ncases of anthrax fever in many outbreaks perish to the extent of 75 or\r\n80 per cent., and the more tardy ones to the number of 50 per cent. In\r\na general outbreak the earlier cases are usually the most fatal, while\r\nlater, when the less susceptible animals are attacked, the mortality\r\nis often decreased. Again, the mortality is often at once arrested by\r\nthe emigration of the herd to a more healthy soil, a large proportion\r\nof those already attacked recovering.\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS.--In prophylaxis the soil demands the first attention. If\r\nthis is damp and calcareous or rich in organic matter, the remainder\r\nof the herd should be at once removed to a drier and more porous soil,\r\nwhere the germ is less likely to be preserved and increased. In an\r\n{937} enzoötic in Livingston County, N.Y., in 1875, 40 bullocks out of\r\n200 had perished in ten days, yet after removal to an adjacent dry\r\npasture and the use of antiseptics with the food and water the attacks\r\nabruptly ceased and 48 out of 50 head already sick recovered. The\r\ndrainage of anthrax soils leads to a steady reduction of the poison,\r\nfavoring as it does the germination of the spores and the destruction\r\nor modification of the germ. When drainage is impossible, the\r\nmortality may be reduced by driving the stock to drier grounds during\r\nthe hot, dry season, by stabling them morning and night when the dews\r\nare on the grass, also in wet times, when they are likely to pull up\r\nthe plants by the roots, or, better still, by cutting the fodder and\r\nsoiling the stock in stables or yards. Yet in all these cases the\r\ngerms will at intervals find access to the animals in the green food\r\nor hay, so that badly infected soils must be secluded from live-stock,\r\nand either be abandoned or devoted to other cultures. A point of the\r\nvery first importance is the safe disposal of the products and\r\ncarcases of the sick. These should be thoroughly burned, or, failing\r\nthis, deeply buried (4 feet) and the graves covered with coal tar and\r\nfenced in from all other stock for from five to ten years.\r\nContaminated litter and fodder should share the same fate. Stables and\r\nyards where the sick have been, and all vehicles and implements used\r\nfor them or their products, should be thoroughly disinfected. In the\r\nepizoötic in Livingston County, above referred to, these measures seem\r\nto have eradicated the disease in the course of six years, though the\r\nland was neither drained nor subjected to cultivation, and the\r\ndangerous meadows are now again pastured with impunity.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sick animals the greatest care is requisite to keep\r\nthem from common drinking- or feeding-troughs; to exclude all other\r\nanimals, even the smaller quadrupeds and birds, which may become the\r\nbearers of the poison; to avoid the chance of the drainage of infected\r\nexcreta into other yards and pastures, and to carefully disinfect and\r\nguard the human attendants against contamination. The sale of animals\r\nout of an infected herd, and, above all, for the meat-market, and the\r\nuse of the milk or other products of such animals, until attested\r\nsound, are highly reprehensible.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are the different methods of protecting the system by\r\ninoculation with modified virus. The first of these is that of\r\nBurdon-Sanderson, Dugnid, and Greenfield, who in 1878 and 1879\r\ninoculated six cattle with the blood of guinea-pigs dead of anthrax,\r\nall of which survived except an old, emaciated, worn-out, and pregnant\r\ncow, and all the survivors would only afterward contract anthrax in a\r\nmild form. The anthrax blood of the guinea-pig inoculated on the sheep\r\nproved fatal. The second mode is that of Pasteur, who cultivated the\r\nanthrax-germ artificially in flasks of meat-infusion, and after the\r\nnourishment in the latter had been used up left the bacilli to\r\ndegenerate until their virulence had been so far decreased that the\r\nliquid could be safely inoculated on animals, so as to produce a mild\r\nanthrax infection and thereafter secure immunity from this poison. For\r\nall the larger domestic animals he found that the eighth day of the\r\nculture sufficed, provided there had been no formation of spores; and\r\nthe method has now been applied on many scores of thousands of\r\ndomestic animals. Klein, however, has found that cultures in\r\npork-broth of the same age are invariably fatal to rodents, {938} and\r\nthat a guinea-pig which survived inoculation with culture a month old\r\ndid not possess immunity against fresh virus. The third method, that\r\nof Toussaint, consists in heating the fresh virus, so as to lessen its\r\nactivity, and then inoculating it on the animals to be protected. He\r\nfound that a temperature of 55° C. (131° F.) maintained for one hour\r\nrendered the virus non-fatal, without impairing its prophylactic\r\npowers on animals inoculated. In spite of a partial failure at Alfort\r\nfrom insufficient heating of the virus, the method has now been firmly\r\nestablished as at once easy and effective.\r\n\r\nThe great value of these discoveries can hardly be overestimated, yet\r\nit is to be feared that the éclat of their reception has led to a far\r\ntoo general adoption of the methods. No one of the methods professes\r\nto destroy the life of the bacillus nor to impair its power of\r\nself-propagation. The bacillus, therefore, is likely to be planted in\r\nthe localities where it is being employed, and, if the soil is\r\nfavorable, to be perpetuated there. It follows also, from the\r\nsusceptibility of the bacillus to change under varying conditions of\r\nlife, that the modification impressed on it by the methods of Pasteur\r\nand Toussaint may be reversed under a reverse state of the\r\nenvironment, and that the harmless virus sown by our inoculators may\r\nin favorable soils produce the more deadly types. The methods secure\r\nthe safety of the individual herd inoculated, at the expense of\r\nplanting in the pasture a seed most perilous to all future\r\nuninoculated herds that may roam there. The only place for such\r\nprotective inoculations is on pastures already charged with the\r\nanthrax bacillus, and from which that cannot be eradicated. On the\r\ndry, healthful soils where the bacillus cannot survive the inoculation\r\nis useless, while on the dense, damp, rich soils favorable to its\r\npreservation, but as yet uninfected or nearly so, this inoculation is\r\nbut sowing deadly seed to secure a very temporary and questionable\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Bloodletting and laxatives have been largely used in the\r\ntreatment of anthrax, though both are mostly useless in acute cases,\r\ntheir possible good effects being anticipated by the early death. When\r\nof service at all, it is probably mainly in reducing that plethora\r\nwhich serves often to enhance the virulence and severity of the\r\nmalady. Apart from these, the agents resorted to are more or less of\r\nan antiseptic nature, and probably exert their action mainly on the\r\nbacilli undergoing development near the surface of the skin or\r\nintestinal mucous membrane. In extensive outbreaks I have had the best\r\nresults with the administration thrice daily of carbolic acid,\r\nnitro-muriatic acid, or bichromate of potassium, and hypodermically of\r\niodide of potassium and sulphate of quinia. Alcoholic stimulants,\r\nchlorate of potassium, and muriate of iron are equally indicated,\r\nespecially when the period of prostration has set in. If the local\r\nanthrax can be detected when there is as yet but a hard nodule, there\r\nshould be no hesitation in cauterizing it to its depth and treating\r\nthe resulting sore and surrounding parts with tincture of iodine or\r\niodized phenol. After crucial incision the nodule may be treated with\r\npowerful caustics (potassa, nitric acid, chloride of zinc), to be\r\nfollowed by iodized phenol, with or without poultices or fomentations.\r\n\r\n\r\n{939} Anthrax in Man (Malignant Pustule or Vesicle, Anthrax\r\nIntestinalis, Mycosis Intestinalis).\r\n\r\nFournier in 1769 first traced the communicated anthrax of man to the\r\nconsumption of the flesh of diseased animals and the handling of their\r\nwool. Until quite recently, however, the form which originated as a\r\nlocal external affection was the only type recognized, while internal\r\nanthrax was confounded with a multitude of other affections.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--That anthrax in man is almost invariably derived from the\r\nlower animals by infection is now undoubted, while for the direct\r\ninfection of man, as of animals, by the germs propagated in the soil,\r\nthere is no absolute proof. The latter mode of propagation has only\r\nbeen recognized in the Herbivora, which are so much more exposed to\r\ncontamination from the soil; yet, abstractly, there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that man is less susceptible to the earth-grown bacillus than\r\nto that produced in the animal, if only he were as frequently exposed\r\nto its infection. The spontaneous development of anthrax apart from\r\nthe pre-existent bacillus in animals or soil is a chimera. The\r\nprincipal modes of infection may be considered as direct and mediate.\r\nAmong the direct are included infection from handling the sick\r\nanimals, their carcases, their wool, hair, bristles, hides, fat, and\r\nguts; the inoculation of physicians, surgeons, and nurses from their\r\npatients; and the infection of men by the meat, milk, and cheese\r\neaten. As attested modes of mediate infection may be cited the\r\ninoculation by insects (mosquitoes, bluebottles, and other\r\nbloodsuckers), and the introduction by water into which anthrax\r\nproducts have drained or been washed; there are also hypothetical\r\ncases in which anthrax-germs from the earth have entered the system in\r\nthe air, drink, or food (raw vegetables). The direct inoculations are\r\nespecially common in certain classes (shepherds, farmers, butchers,\r\nknackers, tanners, veterinarians, and workers in hides, hoofs,\r\nglue-factories, fat-rendering works, in hair, wool, bristles, and\r\ncatgut, and in felting and paper-making). In such cases the disease\r\nusually begins as a local one, and occurs on uncovered portions of the\r\nbody. Three such cases occurred in 1875 on one farm at Avon, N.Y.,\r\nwhere the victims had assisted in burying forty dead cattle, and a\r\nnumber of other similar instances can be adduced in different parts of\r\nthe same State, in one of which a physician was accidentally\r\ninoculated in dressing a farmer's hand. Physicians whose practice\r\nincludes large tanneries become very familiar with the disease and\r\nrecognize it very readily.\r\n\r\nInfection through food is much less frequent in men than in animals,\r\nthe process of cooking combining with the action of the gastric juice\r\nin destroying the poison. Yet it is by no means unknown. The records\r\nabove given of infection in St. Domingo, Naples, and the Russian\r\nsteppes can be easily supplemented. Dr. Keith of Aberdeen, Scotland,\r\nrecords the case of a family that suffered, two of them fatally, after\r\npartaking of broth and meat which had been boiled for hours, one\r\nmember of the family (a vegetarian) having alone escaped. Infection\r\nthrough milk, butter, and cheese is less common, the gravity of the\r\ndisease in animals leading to an early suppression of the mammary\r\nsecretion. In all such cases the infection enters through sores in the\r\nmouth or from the bowels.\r\n\r\nThose cases in which the bacillus enters the system with the inspired\r\n{940} air are probably the least numerous. Yet the germ may reach the\r\nlungs in fine dust, and then find in the delicate respiratory mucous\r\nmembrane the most accessible of all channels into the system.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of men affected is much greater than that of women and\r\nchildren, doubtless by reason of their greater exposure to infection,\r\nand, as in the lower animals, the summer months are most productive of\r\nanthrax. The susceptibility of the human race appears to be less than\r\nthat of the Herbivora, and doubtless varies, as in these animals, with\r\nthe nature of the food. It is at least temporarily exhausted by a\r\nfirst attack, though in exceptional cases and under a strong dose of\r\nthe poison a man may be affected a second time.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Symptoms usually set in within twenty-four hours after\r\ninoculation of the poison, though it is alleged that the incubation\r\nmay be extended to twelve or fourteen days. Itching draws attention to\r\na small red spot like a mosquito bite, but with a black central point.\r\nThis speedily increases to a small rounded swelling (papule), and in\r\nfifteen hours is surmounted by a minute vesicle with dark-red or\r\nbluish contents. From the size of a millet-seed this increases to that\r\nof a pea, and in thirty hours bursts spontaneously or under friction\r\nand forms a dark-red, indurated, comparatively painless nodule (parent\r\nnucleus, Virchow). The adjacent skin shows a swollen areola livid and\r\nred, on which there appear vesicles similar to the first, which pass\r\nthrough the same stages, burst, and leave a livid, hard, or doughy\r\ngangrenous surface. By this time the surrounding skin is red, shining,\r\nand puffy, and the disease continues to spread by the same method of\r\nextension. The diseased part now becomes the centre of an oedematous\r\nswelling which may invade the entire arm, face, or neck, and is\r\nattended with more or less constitutional symptoms. The affected part\r\nmay be cold or hot, and it may show the red lines of lymphangitis and\r\nthe swelling of the adjacent lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\nThe pyrexia, at first slight, often reaches a high grade, attended\r\nwith occasional chilliness, pains in the back and loins, great\r\nprostration, languor, dulness, and even delirium, with cold sweats,\r\nanxiety, dyspnoea, and at times muscular spasms. As in beasts, there\r\nare the dusky skin and mucous membranes, petechiæ, and cyanosis, and\r\nin bad cases there may be sudden collapse and death. The symptoms vary\r\nmuch, however, according to the extent of the local lesion, to the\r\namount of poisonous chemical products thrown into the blood, to the\r\ndegree of the invasion of the blood by the bacillus, and to the\r\ncomplication (not infrequent) of the affection with septicæmia. In the\r\nvery mildest cases the affection never proceeds beyond a local slough,\r\nthe size of a quarter or half dollar, the germs do not enter the blood\r\nin sufficient numbers to survive, the constitutional symptoms are few\r\nor absent, and the sore heals by granulation.\r\n\r\nThe disease usually lasts from six to ten days, and for the first\r\nforty-eight hours the symptoms are generally purely local.\r\n\r\nMalignant anthrax oedema (oedeme maligne) was first observed by\r\nBourgeois as occurring in the eyelid, and has since been recognized in\r\nother parts of the body (arm, forearm, head). It differs mainly from\r\nmalignant pustule in the absence of the preliminary vesicle, of the\r\nhard nodule (parent nucleus), and of the early circumscribed gangrene.\r\nIt has this further peculiarity, that the local disease often appears\r\nas a {941} sequel rather than a precursor of the constitutional\r\ndisturbance. It corresponds in the main to the diffuse erysipelatoid\r\nanthrax of the lower animals, and has been attributed to the anthrax\r\npoison introduced by inhalation. It has been observed to follow eating\r\nof anthrax flesh (Leube, Müller). Inasmuch as the active disease is\r\noften delayed a week or ten days after exposure to infection, it may\r\nreasonably be supposed that the bacillus has been imprisoned on the\r\nmucous membrane, or, entering the blood in small quantity only, has\r\nbeen held in check by the antagonism of the blood-globules until some\r\nelements, escaping into the connective tissue, have started the local\r\ndisease. The symptoms are usually first languor, sleeplessness,\r\nrestlessness, with some sense of chill, debility, and headache, and\r\nfinally, after a few days, the formation of the specific oedema at one\r\npoint or more. This has a pale, semi-translucent, slightly yellowish\r\nor greenish aspect, pits on pressure nearly equally at all points, and\r\ntends to a rapid extension, with concomitant aggravation of the\r\nconstitutional symptoms, and in many cases nausea and vomiting.\r\nGangrene sets in--not progressively, as in malignant pustule, but\r\nsimultaneously over a more extensive surface--and is followed by great\r\nprostration, stupor, dyspnoea, cyanosis, collapse, and death.\r\n\r\nAnthrax intestinalis may be looked upon as the counterpart of the\r\ninternal anthrax or anthrax fever of animals, described above. As in\r\nanimals, the constitutional symptoms may result early in a fatal\r\nissue, with scarcely any local lesion save in the blood and spleen\r\n(Carganico, Leube, Müller, Winkler, Lorinser). As in animals too, the\r\nsanguineous engorgement of the spleen and the intestinal anthrax are\r\noften complicated by external anthrax oedema or malignant pustule\r\n(Heussinger, Virchow, Buhl, Waldeyer, etc.). In this form pyrexia and\r\nother constitutional disturbances are first seen. There is a general\r\nfeeling of languor and depression, with some chilliness, fever, pains\r\nin the limbs, back, and head, vertigo, and ringing in the ears. Even\r\nat this early stage there is noticed a dusky hue of the skin and\r\nvisible mucous membranes, which goes on increasing to a brown or\r\nyellow tinge, to petechiæ, or, with the supervention of dyspnoea, to\r\ncyanosis. Digestive derangement is early shown in abdominal pain,\r\nnausea, vomiting, tenderness, some swelling, and finally diarrhoea,\r\noften bloody and sometimes profuse and exhausting. In acute cases the\r\nsymptoms become rapidly worse, and then follow discharge from the\r\nmouth and nose of uncoagulable blood, dyspnoea, cyanosis, small pulse,\r\ndilated pupils, great anxiety or drowsiness, and stupor, or there may\r\nbe tonic spasms of the trunk or extremities. Death usually results\r\nfrom asphyxia or collapse, as in animals. These cases are almost\r\ninvariably fatal within a period of thirty-six hours, though some\r\nlinger six or seven days.\r\n\r\nAllied to the intestinal anthrax is anthrax angina, a not unknown\r\noccurrence in man. This begins as a bad sore throat, with an\r\nespecially dark-red hue of the pharyngeal mucous membrane. As it\r\nadvances the shade becomes increasingly darker, the power of\r\ndeglutition is lost, serous phlyctenæ with gangrene and deep\r\nulceration set in, but without any tendency to the formation of false\r\nmembrane as in diphtheria. There are early superadded the\r\nconstitutional symptoms above described, and the patient dies in a\r\nstate of collapse or asphyxia.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions closely agree with those already {942}\r\ndescribed for animals in general. The blood presents the same dark-red\r\nor black, tarry, incoagulable, or only slightly coagulable condition\r\nin the worst cases, yet this is less constant in man, as the bacteria\r\nare less constant or numerous in the blood, in keeping with the more\r\nprolonged localization of the external anthrax in man, and the more\r\npronounced antagonism between the blood and the bacillus which results\r\nfrom feeding exclusively or largely on flesh. The red globules do not\r\ntend to adhere together, and the white globules are in excess and very\r\ngranular. The spleen is less extensively enlarged than in animals, but\r\nis highly charged with blood, bacilli, and micrococci. The lymphatic\r\nglands too are enlarged, hyperæmic, cloudy, hemorrhagic at points, of\r\na dark grayish, deep red, or blackish color, and highly charged with\r\nthe bacillus. The surface of the skin and mucous membranes (mouth)\r\npresents hemorrhagic spots and patches, with serous vesicles and\r\neschars. The malignant pustule when cut into presents a central slough\r\nand a surrounding hard indurated mass, both of a dark blood-red, with\r\nsimilar prolongations downward into the adipose tissue, and around all\r\nthe characteristic oedematous infiltration, often streaked with blood.\r\nThe bacillus is found in tufts or dense groups at intervals in the\r\nrete mucosum, the dermis, and the subcutaneous connective tissue. The\r\nserous membranes present the same general lesions as in animals. The\r\nwalls of the stomach and bowels are the seat of cloudy red\r\ninfiltration, with at intervals small hemorrhagic foci, and on the\r\nmucous surface distinct sloughs. Jelly-like exudations are also found\r\nin these membranes in the mesentery and in the retro-peritoneal\r\ntissue. The liver and kidneys are usually congested or are infiltrated\r\nwith an oedematous exudate, and in these, as in all the local anthrax\r\nlesions, the characteristic bacilli are found.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--Malignant pustule is distinguished by its commencing from\r\na minute red point with dark centre, and by its progressive extension\r\nfrom this point by a dark-red, puffy, and vesicular areola, with\r\nsteadily advancing induration and gangrene. The bites of insects have\r\na yellowish central point with red areola. A boil lacks the dark\r\ncentre and the rapidly rising elevated red areola. Carbuncles and\r\nplague-boils tend to appear on clothed parts of the body, respectively\r\non the back of the neck and shoulders and on the trunk and\r\nextremities. In carbuncle several boils rise and burst simultaneously,\r\nthough they may finally slough into one sore, while in anthrax the\r\nextension is from one point. The plague-boil is usually multiple and\r\nmuch more painful than anthrax. The glanderous nodule is usually\r\nmultiple, situated at intervals on the course of a lymphatic, the\r\nintervening portion of which is inflamed, hard, and cord-like. It is\r\nalso usually associated with the specific glairy discharge from the\r\nnose, the nasal ulcers and nodules, and the enlarged painless,\r\nnodular, and indolent submaxillary lymphatic glands. As a last resort\r\nthe detection of the bacillus in the indurated nucleus and the\r\ninoculability of the disease on the lower animals (rabbit,\r\nguinea-pig), may be appealed to.\r\n\r\nMalignant anthrax oedema is less easily recognized, but may be\r\ninferred from the sudden swelling with a dusky yellow or greenish hue\r\nand a tendency to vesiculation and gangrene, the whole preceded and\r\nattended by the constitutional symptoms of anthrax, and, above all,\r\nfrom the presence of the bacillus in the exudate.\r\n\r\n{943} In both of these forms much may be deduced from the known\r\nliability of the district to anthrax, from the occupation of the\r\nsubject as being exposed to infection (worker in hair, wool, bristles,\r\nhides, catgut, etc.), or from his having eaten meat which was open to\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nInternal anthrax is less certainly diagnosed because of the absence of\r\nlocal symptoms until the constitutional disorder is well advanced. Yet\r\nthe reasonable suspicion of infection and the sudden and violent\r\neruption of the disease (headache, nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea,\r\nextreme anxiety, debility, dyspnoea, cyanosis, convulsions, collapse,\r\nwith petechiæ, and local discharges of diffluent blood) serve to\r\nidentify it. The bacillus is not always to be detected in the blood\r\nunder the microscope, but its presence can usually be demonstrated by\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of malignant pustule energetically treated\r\nin its early stages is good. The disease is as yet a local one, and\r\nthe germs can be extinguished by local treatment. In anthrax\r\ndistricts, where the disease is feared and early recognized, the\r\nmortality may be from 5 per cent. (Nicolai) to 9 per cent. (Lengyel,\r\nKoranyi). Even this mortality is mainly due to delay in treatment. In\r\ndistricts, on the other hand, where the malady is infrequent, and\r\nwhere efficient measures are applied too late, the mortality is often\r\n30, 40, or even 50 per cent. After internal infection, and where local\r\nsymptoms only appear after general infection, the case is very\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT.--The prophylaxis of anthrax in man is to a\r\nlarge extent identical with that for animals. All considerations as\r\nregards soil, culture, drainage, sick and dead stock, cremation,\r\nburial, disinfection, etc. have a most important if only a secondary\r\nbearing on the protection of man. Still more important is the free use\r\nof carbolic acid, chloride of lime, or tincture of iodine for the\r\nhands of those dressing unhealthy sores in animals or handling\r\nsuspicious cases of sickness or cadavers, and of those working in\r\nhides, wool, hair, horns, hoofs, guts, etc. Similarly, all products of\r\nanimals with anthrax should be withheld from general use.\r\n\r\nIn external anthrax of man, before the system has been contaminated,\r\nthe thorough destruction by caustic of the diseased part with its\r\ncontained poison is most effectual. Where there is as yet but the\r\npreliminary papule it may be incised and thoroughly destroyed by a\r\nstick of chloride of zinc, caustic potassa, or nitrate of silver, or,\r\nif more convenient, by fuming nitric acid, muriatic or sulphuric acid,\r\nor, perhaps preferably to all others, iodized phenol. Should the\r\nparent nucleus have already formed, it should be excised with the\r\nknife or deeply incised in a crucial direction, and then thoroughly\r\ncauterized with one of the more potent escharotics (caustic potassa,\r\nstrong nitric acid) or with the iodized phenol. The latter agent may\r\nbe further applied on the sound skin adjacent, especially if there is\r\nthe slightest swelling or redness. Should the peripheral oedema\r\npersist or reappear after the cauterization, the latter should be\r\nrepeated until this tendency is overcome. Hypodermic injections of a\r\nsolution of iodine and iodide of potassium may be made into the entire\r\nswelling. After the caustic has done its work the eschar may be\r\nsoftened and its separation favored by a warm poultice containing a\r\nsmall amount of carbolic acid or iodized phenol. This treatment is\r\noften highly beneficial, even after constitutional symptoms have set\r\nin, by arresting the {944} propagation of the bacillus and checking\r\nits introduction and that of its chemical products into the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nConstitutional treatment is not to be forgotten. Carbolic acid may be\r\nprofitably given to the extent of fifteen drops daily, iodide of\r\npotassium ten to twenty grains thrice a day, and sulphate of quinia\r\nten grains at the same intervals. The strength should be sustained by\r\niron (tincture of the chloride) and wine or other alcoholic beverage,\r\nboth being, like the agents already named, calculated to retard if not\r\nto limit the propagation of the bacillus. The diet throughout should\r\nbe nutritious and easily digested.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is known to have eaten anthrax meat an emetic will be\r\nindicated, followed by a smart oleaginous purgative combined with five\r\ndrops of carbolic acid, and subsequently by the constitutional\r\ntreatment above recommended. In case of extensive anthrax oedema,\r\nincisions may be made into the part as far as the yellow exudate\r\nextends, and a poultice containing carbolic acid may be applied. Or,\r\npreferably, the swelling may be freely injected with a weak solution\r\nof iodized phenol (1:100 water), and then painted with the same agent\r\nor with tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{945}\r\n\r\nPYÆMIA AND SEPTICÆMIA.\r\n\r\nBY B. A. WATSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.--There is little to be learned from existing literature of\r\nthe views which were maintained by the ancients, prior to the birth of\r\nChrist, in regard to the morbid conditions now designated pyæmia and\r\nsepticæmia; although it is certain they were recognized by the \"Father\r\nof Medicine,\" who reports a well-marked case of puerperal fever\r\nterminating fatally on the twentieth day of the disease, and also a\r\ncase in which death was unquestionably caused by septic poisoning, as\r\nis clearly shown in the following:[1] \"Criton, in Thasno, while still\r\non foot and going about, was seized with a violent pain in the great\r\ntoe; he took to his bed the same day, had rigors and nausea, recovered\r\nhis heat slightly; at night was delirious. On the second, swelling of\r\nthe whole foot, and about the ankle, erythema with distension and\r\nsmall bullæ (phlyctænæ); acute fever; he became furiously deranged;\r\nalvine discharges, bilious, unmixed, and rather frequent. He died on\r\nthe second day from commencement.\" Additional confirmation of the fact\r\nthat Hippocrates was familiar with the phenomena of these diseases may\r\nbe found in his dissertation on empyema and fevers. Prof. C. Heuter\r\nsays, under the head of septic fever,[2] \"Hippocrates and Celsus\r\nobserved the fever in cases of injuries which proved so dangerous that\r\nthis danger could not have originated from the inflammation or from\r\nthe wound alone.\" Jacotius, a commentator of Hippocrates, has even\r\nmentioned putrid fevers, the same as Adrianus Spigelius, who spoke of\r\nfevers which arise from putrefaction; but both authors, as well as\r\ntheir followers, did not discriminate between septicæmia arising from\r\nthe putrescence of wounds and pyæmia. In the mean time both varieties\r\nwere regarded as intermittent fever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Works of Hippocrates_, trans. by Adams, vol. i. p. 377.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Pitha und Billroth, _Handbuch der Chirurgie_, 1 Band, 2\r\nAbth., 1 Heft, 1 Liefg., S. 6.]\r\n\r\n\"Aretæus lived during the middle of the second century of the\r\nChristian era. In his remarks on pneumonia he observes that the\r\nsubjects of this disease die mostly on the seventh day. 'In certain\r\ncases,' he says, 'much pus is formed in the lungs, or there is a\r\nmetastasis from the side if a greater symptom of convalescence be at\r\nhand. But if, indeed, the matter be translated from the side to the\r\nintestine or bladder, the patients immediately recover from the\r\nperipneumony.' He speaks of a metastasis to the kidneys and bladder\r\nbeing peculiarly favorable in empyema. He ascribes suppuration of the\r\nliver to intemperance and protracted disease, {946} especially\r\ndysentery and colliquative wasting. The symptoms described by him\r\nresemble those of chronic pyæmia.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Braidwood on _Pyæmia_, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nGalen and some of the other ancient physicians recognized the\r\nexistence of septic poisoning, as is shown by the opinions expressed\r\non the subject of putrid fevers. According to Galen, putrid fevers may\r\neither arise from the conversion of ephemerals, or originally from\r\nputrefaction of the fluids within the vessels.\r\n\r\nAetius states that they arise from constriction of the skin or\r\nviscidity of the humors, whereby the perspiration is stopped, and the\r\nquantity of vital heat so altered as to give rise to putrefaction,\r\nfirst of the fluids, and afterward of the fat and solid parts. When\r\nthese corrupted fluids are contained within the vessels they occasion\r\nsynochous fevers, but when distributed over the body they give rise to\r\nintermittents. Synesius and Constantinus Africanus give a similar\r\naccount. Alexander gives an interesting and ingenious disquisition on\r\nthe origin and nature of putrid fevers, one of the most common causes\r\nof which he holds to be the conversion of ephemeral fevers, and the\r\ninseparable symptoms being want of concoction in the urine and\r\nquickness of the pulse with systoles. This is the account of them\r\ngiven by most of the other authorities, both Greek and Arabian, so\r\nthat we need not enter into any circumstantial exposition of their\r\nviews. We shall merely give the brief account of those furnished by\r\nPalladius. There are, he says, two kinds of synochous fevers, the one\r\nbeing occasioned by effervescence, and the other by putrefaction of\r\nthe blood; of these the latter are the more protracted and dangerous.\r\nIn them the pulse is contracted, the heat pungent, and the urine white\r\nand putrid.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Paulus Ægineta, trans. by Adams, vol. i. p. 236 (Sydenham\r\nSoc., 1844).]\r\n\r\nA new era in the literature of this subject dawned during the\r\nsixteenth century. Ambrose Paré and Bartholomew Maggi each published a\r\nwork in which they pointed out the old errors and announced new\r\ntruths. Paré's _Treatise on Gunshot Wounds_ was published in Paris in\r\n1551, while Maggi's treatise appeared a year later at Bologna. Paré\r\ngained his first experience in the treatment of gunshot wounds in\r\n1536, which is described as follows: \"The storming of the small\r\nmountain-fortress Villane, near Susa, probably gave him for the first\r\ntime full occupation, and he followed in all things the example of\r\nolder colleagues. Like them, although hesitatingly, he poured into the\r\ngunshot wounds boiling oil of elder to destroy the poison, but the oil\r\nfell short, and then he was compelled to dress the other wounded men\r\nwith an ointment of oil of roses and turpentine. Fearing that the\r\nlatter would soon become victims of the wound-poison, he passed a\r\nsleepless night, got up early to see the ill consequences, but was\r\ngreatly surprised to find those that he had half given up free from\r\npain and without inflammation or swelling, while those who had been\r\ntreated with boiling oil lay in a state of fever, with great pain and\r\nmuch swelling. He therefore determined, as he tells us, never again to\r\nburn the poor subjects of gunshot wounds so cruelly.\"[5] It will be\r\nseen that Paré's treatise on gunshot wounds was published fifteen\r\nyears after this impressive experience at the fortress of Villane. In\r\nthis work he sought to correct the prevailing idea that {947} gunshot\r\nwounds were poisonous, and was ably supported in his effort by\r\nBartholomew Maggi; but it required all the respect which Paré enjoyed\r\nin riper years to gradually obtain consideration for the new view. The\r\nidea that gunshot wounds were poisonous is supposed to have originated\r\nin the fact that in every war there are cases of acute sepsis,\r\ndeveloped after the infliction of these injuries, which agree in all\r\ntheir essential points with the results of the bites of poisonous\r\nsnakes. We are even informed that during the late Franco-Prussian War\r\nthere were cases which even excited suspicion among the laymen that\r\nthe enemy had used poisoned missiles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _German Clinical Lectures_, 2d series (New Sydenham Soc.,\r\n1877), p. 65 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the error which Paré and Maggi endeavored to correct is\r\nshown by the declaration made by Johannes de Vigo at the commencement\r\nof the sixteenth century, who expressed in dogmatic form the views\r\nthen firmly held by physicians. \"A gunshot wound is a contused wound,\r\nhe says, for the bullet is round; it is burnt, for the bullet is\r\nheated; it is poisoned, for the powder is poisonous. The poisoning is\r\nthe essential condition; therefore the treatment must be directed\r\nabove all to counteract this.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step was that a poisonous substance may develop itself or\r\nsettle in the wound, and especially in gunshot wounds--a substance\r\nwhich has nothing to do with powder or lead. Paré himself adopted this\r\nview. When he took part in the siege of Rouen many wounds sloughed and\r\nhad a cadaverous smell, and on opening the bodies of those who died\r\nnumerous collections of pus were found in different parts full of\r\ngreenish ill-smelling ichor. Besiegers and besieged believed\r\nthemselves to be wounded with poisoned bullets. Paré looked for the\r\ncause in a deterioration of the air by the large quantity of\r\ndecomposing substances, and he appears to have assumed, as is done at\r\nthis day, a direct action of the so-called deteriorated air upon the\r\nwound itself.\r\n\r\nThe evil influence of air vitiated by the products of decomposition,\r\nnot upon wounds only, but upon the organism generally, has never been\r\nlost sight of by physicians since that time. That rotten straw,\r\ndecomposing bodies of men and animals, surfaces saturated with\r\nexcrement, and overcrowding of badly-ventilated hospitals give rise to\r\ninfectious fevers and unhealthy state of wounds is not a result of\r\nmodern observation only. That it was a question of the processes of\r\nfermentation which became communicated to the body by means of the\r\nexciters of fermentation contained in the air was a view frequently\r\nadopted. \"To quote one only out of many; John Pringle, in his\r\n_Observations on the Diseases of the Army_, published in 1775, devotes\r\na chapter especially to 'Diseases resulting from Bad Air,' and his\r\nforty-eight experiments on septic and antiseptic substances contain\r\nnumerous hints at attempts resembling those made at the present day to\r\ndetermine the antiseptic power of certain things. No advance was made,\r\nhowever, beyond vague surmises concerning the nature of the exciters\r\nof putrefaction, and they were for the most part looked for amongst\r\nthe volatile, ill-smelling products of decomposition, and were\r\nbelieved to be extremely subtle gaseous matters.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _German Clinical Lectures_, Second Series (New Sydenham\r\nSoc., 1877), p. 67 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAmbrose Paré (1582) first taught that secondary abscesses in surgical\r\ncases, \"which he had observed in the spleen, lungs, liver, and other\r\nviscera, were due to a changed condition of the fluids produced by\r\nsome {948} unknown alteration in the atmosphere and determining a\r\npurulent diathesis.\"[7] The following quotations force the conclusion\r\nthat in the early history of medicine there was supposed to be some\r\nimportant relation between wounds of the head and multiple abscesses.\r\n\"Nicholas Massa (1553) mentions a case of abscess of the left lung,\r\nfollowing an injury of the head.\"[8] \"Valsalva (1707) was induced by\r\nhis own observation to say that the viscera of the thorax were\r\nsometimes affected in wounds of the head.\" \"Desault (1794) considered\r\nabscesses of the liver to be a very frequent sequence of head\r\ninjuries.\"[9] The fact that wounds of the head were frequently\r\nfollowed by abscesses of the lungs, liver, and other organs probably\r\nled to the opinion expressed by Desault, Barthez, Brodie, W. Phillips,\r\nCopeland, and others, that the disease had its origin in a nervous\r\nagency.[10] \"Bertrandi and Audouille (1819) sought for a mechanical\r\nexplanation of the occurrence of hepatic abscesses after head injuries\r\nand in cases of apoplexy.\" Morgagni (1740) somewhat obscurely hinted\r\nat the doctrine of the reabsorption of pus--a doctrine which was\r\nafterward elaborated by Quesnay in 1819. Morgagni, after quoting a\r\ngreat number of instances of wounds of the head followed by visceral\r\nabscesses, opposes the idea of a mechanical transportation of pus\r\nthither, and states that abscesses are not confined to the liver and\r\nthat they may follow wounds and ulcers of other parts besides the\r\nhead. He ascribes their formation to particles of pus (not always\r\ndeposited in the form of pus) resulting from the softening and\r\nsuppuration of small tubercles, which, having been mixed with the\r\nblood and disseminated, are arrested in some of the narrow passages,\r\nperhaps of the lymphatic glands, and by obstructing and irritating\r\nthese, as happens in the production of venereal buboes, and by\r\nretaining the humors therein, distend them and give origin to the\r\ngeneration of a much more copious pus than what is carried thither;\r\nand by this means, he says, we may also conceive how it is that much\r\nmore pus is frequently formed in the viscera and cavities of the\r\nbodies than a small wound could have produced.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Braidwood on _Pyæmia_, p. 2 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Ibid._, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Ibid._, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Ibid._, p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Ibid._, p. 3 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nCheston (1766) believed that the translation of matter from one point\r\nto another was a frequent occurrence after amputations of the larger\r\nlimbs. John Hunter (1793), and after him Velpeau, demonstrated the\r\nexistence of pus in the blood. Hunter believed that the pus was\r\nderived from the interior of the inflamed veins. He described three\r\nforms of inflammation of these vessels--viz. adhesive, suppurative,\r\nand ulcerative. Pyæmia he considered to be an aggravated form of\r\nphlebitis. Arnott (1829) concluded from his observations--1, That\r\ndeath does not result from the extension of the inflammation of the\r\nveins to the heart; 2, that the dangerous consequences of phlebitis\r\nhave no direct relation to the extent of the vein which is inflamed;\r\nand, 3, that the presence of pus in the veins, though the principal,\r\nis not the sole, cause of the secondary affection. He accordingly\r\nopposes the idea of Abernethy, Carmichael, and others that the\r\nconstitutional affection is owing to the extension of the inflammation\r\nto the heart. The publication of Arnott's and Dance's treatises led to\r\nthe general opinion being held in England and in France that phlebitis\r\nand purulent infection were identical affections, or, at least, that\r\nthe latter was invariably caused by the former.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Ibid._, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n{949} Cruveilhier (1829), admitting the doctrine of the formation of\r\nsecondary abscesses being due to capillary phlebitis, further laid\r\ndown an axiom, since proved untenable, that the foreign body\r\nintroduced into the veins, whose elimination by the emunctories is\r\nimpossible, will produce visceral abscesses similar to those which\r\noccur after wounds and operations, and that these abscesses are the\r\nresult of capillary phlebitis of those viscera.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Braidwood on _Pyæmia_, p. 14 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the present century it was generally admitted\r\nby the best authorities that the symptoms and lesions in pyæmia were\r\nentirely due to the presence of pus in the blood, but whether absorbed\r\nfrom the wound or developed by an inflammation of the veins was at\r\nthat time a disputed question.\r\n\r\nHaller made the first experiments on animals with putrefying\r\nsubstances in the latter part of the eighteenth century, and was\r\nconvinced that nothing destroys the animal fluids more powerfully than\r\nputrefaction. Gaspard (1822) published a complete work based upon his\r\nexperimental research in regard to the action of putrefying substances\r\non living organisms. He, having produced septic infection in animals\r\nby injecting into their blood pus or other putrefying substances, thus\r\nprepared the way for other experimenters, by whom he was quickly\r\nfollowed. Ernst R. Virchow repeated the experiments of Gaspard, and\r\ndiscriminated with greater precision between the surgical\r\ndiseases--septicæmia with its sharply-defined group of symptoms, the\r\nopposite of pyæmia. Furthermore, \"he showed that the changes in the\r\nveins which had been regarded as due to phlebitis were caused by the\r\ncoagulation of the blood and by subsequent degenerative changes in the\r\nthrombi thus formed; that the infarctions and abscesses seen in the\r\nviscera were due to emboli which had become detached from softened\r\nthrombi; that, as the white blood-globules and pus-globules were\r\nidentical in appearance, they could not be distinguished; and that it\r\nwas improbable that pus-globules made their way into the blood.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _The International Encyclopædia of Surgery_, ed. by\r\nAshhurst, vol. i. p. 204.]\r\n\r\nPanum (1855) conducted a series of important experiments, and\r\nendeavored to separate the infectious substance and determine its real\r\nnature. He concludes that the real poison is not identical with any of\r\nthe chemical combinations or any of the single substances which have\r\nuntil now been isolated by chemical analysis from the products of\r\nnitrogenous decomposition, but adds that it is probably a concealed\r\nferment belonging to the so-called extractive matters--carbonate of\r\nammonium, leucin, tyrosin, fatty acids, acetic acid, etc. Furthermore,\r\nthat the putrid poison is stable, fixed, and non-volatile; that it is\r\nneither decomposed by boiling nor by evaporation to dryness; that it\r\nis insoluble in absolute alcohol, but soluble in water; that the\r\nalbuminous substances found in putrefying liquids become venomous only\r\nbecause they are impregnated with the septic poison; and that washing\r\nthese substances in a large quantity of water renders them innocuous;\r\nand that the energy of these putrid poisons can only be compared to\r\nthe venom of serpents, curare, and other vegetable alkaloids.\r\n\r\nThe prize offered by the Faculty of Medicine at Munich for the best\r\nessay on the action of putrefying substances in the animal organism\r\nwas awarded to Hemmer in 1866. His essay was distinguished for its\r\n{950} accurate delineation of the pertaining literature and for the\r\nnumber of experiments reported, while his conclusions bear a striking\r\nresemblance to those of Panum.\r\n\r\nBergmann in 1868 sought to determine the poisonous element contained\r\nin decomposing animal substances, and for this purpose chemically\r\ntreated putrid fluids, hoping to find the agent that would excite all\r\nsymptoms of septic poisoning. He obtained a body of this nature from\r\ndecomposing yeast, which he called sepsin, although we have no proof\r\nthat either he or any one else has ever found the same in pus or any\r\ndecomposing animal matters; and even if it had been found in these, it\r\nwould then become necessary to demonstrate the fact that no other\r\nsubstance contained in the putrefying liquids could produce septic\r\npoisoning. Many other experiments, similar to those which have just\r\nbeen mentioned, were made in the mean while by Magendie, Stich,\r\nBillroth and Hufschmidt, O. Weber, Duprey, Learet, Urfrey, Saltzman,\r\nFischer, Frese, Muller, and others. Bergmann had extracted the sepsin\r\nfrom yeast, but Schmidt and Petersen (1869) were able to obtain it\r\nfrom putrefied blood. In 1869, Zuelzer and Sonnenschein claimed, on\r\nthe contrary, to have separated a new, unnamed septic alkaloid, which\r\nwas not the sepsin, and the action of which resembled that of atropine\r\nand hyoscyamine. Nevertheless, the separation of the sepsin or of the\r\nalkaloid of Zuelzer seemed to demand a talent in the manipulator which\r\nis not possessed by everybody, and rare are the chemists who possess\r\nit--so rare that these substances are not yet either officinally\r\nrecognized or classified. The attention of the medical profession had\r\nnow become thoroughly fixed on the chemical character and the\r\nphysiological action of these newly-discovered substances. It is\r\ntherefore only natural that we should find during the next few months\r\nthat the medical societies were much occupied with discussions on\r\nthese subjects, although no important progress seems to have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nPolitical events now gave a new direction to thought, and the\r\nFranco-Prussian War filled the hospitals of both nations with wounded\r\nin which there was opened a grand field for the practical study of\r\npurulent infection in all its various forms. Humanity now demanded the\r\nbest efforts of the medical profession. Neither the mechanical nor\r\nchemical theories had ever yielded practically any beneficial results;\r\nconsequently, something better was demanded in this emergency. It was\r\nduring this important epoch that the germ theory began to assume form\r\nand to attract some general attention in the medical profession,\r\nalthough Schroeder and Dusch had shown in 1854 that the filtration of\r\nthe air through cotton was sufficient to prevent the putrefaction of\r\nalbuminous substances which had been previously boiled. Pasteur also\r\ndemonstrated the existence of germs in the air in 1863, and likewise\r\nshowed their agency in the process of fermentation.\r\n\r\nLister began the antiseptic treatment of compound fractures in 1865,\r\nalthough he did not publish his report until 1867. The cotton-wadding\r\ntreatment of wounds, which is based on the fact that the air passed\r\nthrough cotton is freed by it from all germs, was first employed by\r\nAlphonse Guérin, who refers to it in the following language: \"In the\r\nlatter part of 1870 I had the idea that the cause of purulent\r\ninfection existed in the germs or ferments which Pasteur had\r\ndiscovered in the air. It was at the end of the war; all the cases of\r\n{951} amputation had succumbed to the purulent infection, and not a\r\nsingle large wound escaped the scourge. The studies which I had made\r\nfrom the month of September to the end of December in 1870 had\r\nconfirmed me in the opinion that purulent infection is neither due to\r\nphlebitis nor to the absorption of pus. I believed more firmly than\r\never that the miasms emanating from the pus of the wounds were the\r\nreal cause of this frightful malady to which I had been compelled to\r\nsee the wounded succumb, whether they were treated with charpie or\r\ncerate, whether with the lotions of alcohol or of carbolic acid\r\napplied several times a day, and which was soaked up by the linen\r\nwhich remained in contact with the wounds. But this miasmatic theory\r\nremained, nevertheless, useless, since from 1847, when I professed it,\r\nthe cases of amputation in my service succumbed to purulent infection\r\nin about the same proportion as those who were cared for by my\r\npartisan colleagues did from the absorption of pus or the inflammation\r\nof the veins. In my despair, seeking constantly a means to prevent\r\nthis terrible complication of wounds, I had thought of the miasm of\r\nwhich I had admitted the existence, because I was not otherwise able\r\nto explain the production of the purulent infection, and which was not\r\nonly known to me by its deleterious influence, but which appeared to\r\nconsist of living corpuscles of the nature of those that Pasteur had\r\nseen in the air; and then the history of the miasmatic poison\r\npossessed for me a new clearness. So, said I then, the miasms are the\r\nferments. I am able to protect the wounded against their fatal\r\ninfluence by filtering the air, as Pasteur had done, while\r\nmaintaining, in opposition to Pouchet of Rouen, that there is no\r\nspontaneous generation. I thought then of the cotton-wadding\r\ntreatment, and had the satisfaction of seeing my anticipation\r\nrealized. It was from this time that dates in reality the theory of\r\ngerms or of ferments as a cause of purulent infection.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Nouveau Dictionnaire de Médicine et de Chirurgie\r\npratiques_, t. xxx. p. 265.]\r\n\r\nA series of important experiments were made in 1872 by Coze and Feltz,\r\nwhich consisted in injecting into the jugular vein and the\r\nsubcutaneous cellular tissue putrid liquids; and they record, among\r\nother interesting results observed by them, that the blood of the\r\nanimal thus destroyed always contained infusoria. These experiments\r\nhave been repeated and their results confirmed by several observers,\r\nand in particular by Davine in 1872.\r\n\r\nAnother series of experiments were made by Behier and Lionville, which\r\nabsolutely confirmed those of Coze and Feltz; they likewise found in\r\nthe blood rounded and rod-shaped corpuscles possessed of movements\r\nmore or less energetic. Vulpian also confirmed the results obtained by\r\nDavine and Behier. He says: \"It will not do to deny to the immovable\r\nor movable vibriones and corpuscles found by Coze, Behier, and Davine\r\na very important rôle, because they are not the essential contagion of\r\nthe poisonous blood; it is at least necessary that they should be\r\nthere in order to produce the alterations which have occurred in this\r\nfluid.\" Chauveau has experimented extensively, and likewise admits the\r\naction of the septic vibriones of Pasteur.\r\n\r\nPasteur has made known the result of his investigation in\r\ncommunications to the Academy of Medicine in 1877, 1878, and 1879.\r\nThere exist, according to him, two principal vibriones--the pyogenic,\r\nor the {952} producer of pus, and the septic, the producer of the\r\nproperly so-called septicæmia. But the latter is not a unique disease,\r\nand, as we have seen from the outset, there are confounded under this\r\nname different states, light or grave, corresponding with as many\r\nforms of vibriones.\r\n\r\nThe questions of greatest practical importance in regard to this whole\r\ngroup of diseases seem to us to be, as expressed by Dr. Budd, where\r\nand how the specific poisons which cause them breed and multiply; and\r\nall who have closely followed the scientific investigations bearing on\r\nthese points which Prof. Tyndall has conducted during the past few\r\nyears, and who have repeated even a portion of his experiments, cannot\r\nfail to be powerfully impressed with the value of the views which he\r\nembodied in his work entitled _Floating Matter of the Air_.\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE.--The want of a systematic classification of the various\r\nmorbid conditions arising from septic infection has long embarrassed\r\nalike authors and students, and even at the present time the vague\r\nmanner in which the terms pyæmia and septicæmia are used leads to much\r\nconfusion. The Pathological Society of London appointed, in 1869, a\r\ncommittee to investigate the nature and causes of those infectious\r\ndiseases known as pyæmia, septicæmia, and purulent infection. This\r\ncommittee, having spent ten years in the study of these affections in\r\nconnection with nearly all the large hospitals of London, report the\r\nfollowing: \"Summary.--It would seem, from a careful study of all the\r\ncases here collected, that it is probable that the diseases commonly\r\nknown clinically as pyæmia and septicæmia may be grouped as follows:\r\n1. Septic intoxication.--The effects of poisoning by the chemical\r\nproducts of putrefaction. A non-infective disease. 2. Septic\r\ninfection.--A general infective process arising from the introduction\r\nof some peculiar constituent of putrid matter into the blood-stream.\r\nIt is supposed by some to be due to the multiplication of living\r\norganisms in the blood, and by others to the effect of a non-organized\r\nferment. It terminates fatally without secondary inflammations. 3.\r\nPyæmia (for want of a better name).--An infective process probably,\r\nsimilar in nature to septic infection, but differing from it by giving\r\nrise to local inflammation and suppurations, often complicated by\r\nthrombosis and embolism, probably due to the blood condition. 4.\r\nThrombosis with softening and decomposition of the thrombus and\r\nembolism, causing local abscesses in the viscera wherever the septic\r\nemboli lodge, but without the development of any general infective\r\nprocess. 5. Various combinations of one or more of the foregoing\r\nconditions in the same subject. 6. Infective periostitis or acute\r\nnecrosis. 7. Infective endocarditis or ulcerative endocarditis. 8.\r\nInfective myositis. 9. A group of obscure cases in which it is\r\nimpossible to form any idea as to the exact nature, often called\r\nspontaneous septicæmia or pyæmia.\"[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Trans. Pathological Soc. of London_, vol. xxx. p. 38.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the earlier writers on medicine, although\r\naware of the existence of septic diseases, wholly failed to\r\ndiscriminate between pyæmia and septicæmia until 1848, and even since\r\nthat date these terms have been only partially adopted by authors, by\r\nwhom frequently the meaning of the same word has been so modified as\r\nto refer to essentially different conditions. Custom having fully\r\nsanctioned the use of these terms, it is now thought that a separate\r\nconsideration of their {953} nomenclature may be advantageous, and\r\nconsequently we shall pursue this course.\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE OF PYÆMIA.--In Dunglison's _Medical Dictionary_ the\r\ndefinition given to pyæmia is, \"Pyohæmia,\" and the latter word is\r\ndefined as follows: \"Pyohæmia, Pyæmia, Pyohémie (F.), from _pyo_, and\r\n[Greek: haema], 'blood;' alteration of the blood by pus, giving\r\noccasion to the diathesis seu infectio purulentia.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed by the Pathological Society of London in 1869\r\nreport on this subject as follows: \"The most common definition of\r\npyæmia is, no doubt, that adopted by the College of Physicians in the\r\nnomenclature of diseases. It is as follows: 'A febrile affection\r\nresulting in the formation of abscesses in the viscera and other\r\nparts.'\"\r\n\r\nBirch-Hirschfeld includes under the name pyæmia \"all cases in which\r\nany general infective process is set up as a secondary consequence of\r\na wound.\"[17] Virchow has proposed the name ichorrhæmia. O. Weber uses\r\nthe name embolhæmia for the condition in which emboli are found in the\r\nblood. Hueter in pure cases of purulent infection without metastasis\r\ncalls the disease pyohæmia simplex; in cases with metastasis, pyohæmia\r\nmultiplex; and when complicated with septicæmia he designates it as\r\nsepto-pyohæmia. The term hospitalism has been applied to this disease\r\nby Erichsen and Sir James Y. Simpson, and the former remarks that \"the\r\nterm pyæmia is used in a very wide and elastic manner, and by many is\r\nmade to include various forms of blood-poisoning.\"[18] Billroth says:\r\n\"Pyæmia is a disease which we believe to arise from the taking up of\r\npus, or of the constituent parts of pus, into the blood.\" Koch employs\r\nthe term pyæmia merely to denote a general affection accompanied by\r\nmetastatic inflammation and suppuration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Trans. Pathological Soc. of London_, vol. xxx. p. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _On Hospitalism_, p. 73.]\r\n\r\nThe French definition and nomenclature of pyæmia, according to Guérin,\r\nis as follows: \"Purulent infection, or pyohæmia, purulent fever,\r\nsurgical typhus.\" The purulent infection is a poisoning of the blood,\r\nwhich terminates by the formation of multiple abscesses, which have\r\nbeen improperly known under the name of metastatic abscesses.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to 1870 surgeons admitted that these abscesses were the\r\nresult of a phlebitis having its origin in a wound exposed to the air.\r\nTherefore, this disease was variously designated under the name of\r\nphlebitis, pyohæmia, or purulent infection. Tessier called it purulent\r\ndiathesis; \"in 1847, I compared it to the typhus, and, as the poison\r\nis absorbed from the surface of the wound in the purulent infection, I\r\ngave it the name of surgical typhus or purulent fever.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Nouveau Dict. de Méd. et de Chir. pratiques_, t. xxx.\r\np. 222.]\r\n\r\nHaving given enough on this subject to answer our purpose, we will\r\nconsider the nomenclature of another septic complication.\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE OF SEPTICÆMIA. The term septicæmia was first employed by\r\nPiorry, and was applied for a considerable time to all those diseases\r\nin which the blood was submitted to a septic influence. Therefore, the\r\nterm was made applicable to the morbid conditions existing in anthrax,\r\nglanders, typhus and typhoid fevers, variola, and also all forms of\r\npurulent and putrid infections. Guérin now adds: \"Fortunately, for\r\nseveral years the most competent authors seem to have wished to {954}\r\nreserve the name of septicæmia for what surgeons call putrid\r\ninfection, and for the morbid state that the experimenters produce by\r\nthe injection of putrid material into healthy animal tissues; it is\r\nconsequently the experimental septicæmia which we aim at first and\r\nforemost.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Nouveau Dict. de Méd. et de Chir. pratiques_, t. xxx.]\r\n\r\nDunglison defines septicæmia with a single word, septæmia. The same\r\nauthority gives the following derivation and definition to septæmia:\r\n\"From [Greek: sêptos], 'rotten,' and [Greek: haema], 'blood.' A morbid\r\ncondition of the blood produced by septic or putrid matters.\"\r\n\r\nSanderson says: \"What I mean by septicæmia is a constitutional\r\ndisorder of limited duration, produced by the entrance into the\r\nblood-stream of a certain quantity of septic material. It must,\r\ntherefore, be regarded less as a disease than as a complication,\r\ndiffering from pyæmia not only in the fact that it has no necessary\r\nconnection with any local process, either primary or secondary, but\r\nalso in the important particular that it has no development.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _British Medical Journal_, Dec. 22, 1877.]\r\n\r\nBoth Davine and Koch designate as septicæmic all cases of general\r\ninfection from wounds in which no metastatic changes occur.\r\n\"Birch-Hirschfeld limits the term septicæmia much in the same way as\r\nSanderson. He describes as septicæmia those cases in which the disease\r\nresults merely from the absorption of the products of putrefaction,\r\nand regards it merely as a process of poisoning, such as might arise\r\nfrom the injection of any other noxious chemical substance into the\r\nblood. Pyæmia, on the other hand, he considers a truly infective\r\nprocess, probably due to the entrance of specific organisms into the\r\nbody. He would therefore include many of the cases described by Koch\r\nas septicæmia under pyæmia.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Trans. Pathological Soc. of London_, vol. xxx. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nBillroth defines septicæmia as an \"acute general affection which\r\narises from the taking up of various kinds of putrid substances into\r\nthe blood, and it is believed that these putrid substances so change\r\nthe quality of the blood that it can no longer fulfil its\r\nphysiological functions.\"[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Lectures on Surgical Pathology and Therapeutics_\r\n(trans. from 8th ed.), vol. ii. p. 41.]\r\n\r\nHeuter defines septicæmia as a fever caused by the entrance into the\r\ncirculation of the products of putrefaction from local centres of\r\ndecomposition. He draws no clear distinction between an infective and\r\na non-infective form, but the affection he describes as pyæmia simplex\r\nor pyæmia without metastasis seems to include many cases which Davine,\r\nKoch, and others would include under septicæmia.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Trans. Path. Soc. of London_, vol. xxx. p. 9, 1879.]\r\n\r\nHaving before us the views of some of the prominent authors who have\r\nwritten upon the nomenclature of pyæmia and septicæmia, we observe\r\nthat the use of these terms is based either on known or imaginary\r\nmorbid conditions of the body, more especially of the blood. It\r\ntherefore seems that the first step toward determining the proper\r\nlimit within which these terms can be employed consists in learning\r\ntheir accurate meaning, which is fortunately clearly shown by their\r\nderivation. The next step consists in the application of these terms\r\nto the morbid conditions which are described more or less completely\r\nby these words. It may be here added that there will be frequently\r\nrequired for a full and definite expression certain modifying words,\r\nand consequently we may {955} properly employ such phrases as\r\npuerperal septicæmia, spontaneous pyæmia, etc.\r\n\r\nHaving carefully examined the terms employed by various authors in\r\nconnection with the morbid changes which are known to occur in certain\r\ncases of septic contamination, we give our preference to the following\r\nnomenclature: Septicæmia, septo-pyæmia, pyæmia simplex, and pyæmia\r\nmultiplex.\r\n\r\nThe term septo-pyæmia is applied to a morbid condition possessing\r\ncertain peculiarities of both septicæmia and pyæmia, and it is\r\nsupposed to arise from the absorption of both poisons; the term pyæmia\r\nsimplex is applied to a pyæmic condition in which there is no\r\nmetastasis; while the name pyæmia multiplex is given to that form of\r\ndisease which is characterized by the existence of metastatic\r\nabscesses. It may be well to add here that this nomenclature is not\r\nintended to cover all cases of septic poisoning, but to be applied to\r\nthose cases only in which the morbid changes give to the terms a\r\ncertain degree of appropriateness.\r\n\r\nSeptic poisoning may be justly regarded as a single chain composed of\r\nmany links. Take, for example, a case of amputation of the thigh,\r\nfollowed within a few hours by traumatic fever, later by septicæmia;\r\nafterward there may be developed secondary fever; formation of\r\nichorous pus, with absorption and its concomitants; pyæmia,\r\naccompanied by embolism, thrombosis, abscess in the lungs, liver, etc.\r\nTo these may also occasionally be added phlebitis and inflammation of\r\nthe joints, terminating speedily in suppuration. This chain may in\r\nthis case be further lengthened or varied with traumatic erysipelas or\r\nwith hospital gangrene. In fact, the variations in these cases are\r\nvery numerous, and all these conditions, together with many others,\r\nare due to septic blood-poisoning.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY OF PYÆMIA.--Four theories have been advanced at different\r\ntimes to explain the etiology of pyæmia, and they have been designated\r\nas follows: the mechanical, the nervous, the chemical, and the germ\r\ntheories respectively; and their action is based on the following\r\nhypotheses: 1, that pus enters the blood, circulates in it, and acts\r\nas a poison; 2, that an irritation is excited in certain visceral\r\norgans in sympathy with inflammation of the fibrous membranes of the\r\ncranium or the bones of the upper or lower extremity, and there is\r\nthus produced a metastasis to these organs of an ichorous miasm or of\r\na fluid which is more or less acrid; 3, that a chemical poison is\r\ngenerated from the pus in the wound, and when it is absorbed produces\r\npyæmic manifestations; 4, that the putrefaction of pus in wounds is\r\ncaused by a microscopic organism which enters the circulation and\r\nproduces pyæmia.\r\n\r\nThe first hypothesis was somewhat modified, as we have already\r\nmentioned, by John Hunter and others, who advanced the idea that\r\npyæmia consisted essentially of a phlebitis, and that the pus found in\r\nthe circulation had its origin within the veins. However, it has since\r\nbeen shown conclusively that pyæmia cannot be produced by the\r\ninjection of healthy pus into the cellular tissue or veins. This fact\r\nhaving been generally admitted by the profession, it is thought\r\nunnecessary to adduce here either the experiments or the arguments\r\nwhich have been accepted as conclusive on this important point. It is\r\nnot even necessary to bring forward the disputed question of the\r\npossibility of the entrance of pus into the blood, since laudable pus\r\ndoes not produce pyæmia. In fact, we have reached a point in the {956}\r\nprogress of medicine when the discussion of either the first or second\r\nhypothesis ceases to be interesting to medical men. Consequently, our\r\nchief interest in the study of the etiology of pyæmia centres in the\r\nthird and fourth hypotheses; and we believe that it may be safely\r\nasserted that the origin of this disease has been fully demonstrated\r\nby an almost unlimited number of experiments.\r\n\r\nThe injection of pus into living animals produces local, remote, and\r\nconstitutional symptoms. The character of these symptoms depends\r\nprincipally on the kind of pus, laudable or ichorous, the quantity\r\ninjected, and the site of the injection. It will be readily perceived\r\nthat in cases where the pus is thrown directly into a vein the local\r\nsymptoms would be unimportant, while the danger of remote\r\ntrouble--metastatic abscesses in the lungs, liver, etc.--would be very\r\ngreat; but should the injection be made into the connective tissue,\r\nthen the relations would be reversed. Constitutional symptoms may\r\nexist in both cases, but will differ in character and degree.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the character of the pus, and its agency in the\r\nproduction of this disease, Billroth says: \"The old view, that pyæmia\r\nis only induced when decomposed pus (ichor) is reabsorbed, is entirely\r\nerroneous. There are cases where decomposed, putrid pus enters the\r\nblood, and which present a combination of the symptoms of septicæmia\r\nand pyæmia (septo-pyæmia of Hueter).\"[25] Dupuytren failed to produce\r\nmetastasis by injections of pus into the veins of dogs; these results\r\nwere confirmed by Boyer, who only obtained metastasis when he used\r\nichorous pus in his experiments. The same results are recorded in the\r\nworks of Günther and Sedillot, based on numerous experiments. Beck\r\nmade fourteen experiments very carefully, but did not succeed in\r\nproducing metastasis in a single case. The same results are recorded\r\nby a commission of the Physiological Society of Edinburgh. O. Weber\r\nhas recently shown by extended experiments that carefully filtered pus\r\nwill not produce metastatic abscesses in the lungs. Therefore, it may\r\nbe considered as proved that fluid pus injected into the veins of an\r\nanimal produces no metastatic points of inflammation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Surgical Pathology_, p. 344.]\r\n\r\nIt should not be supposed, however, that because injection of fresh\r\n(non-ichorous) pus failed to produce metastatic abscesses, it was\r\ntherefore without results, as the earlier experimenters thought.\r\nBillroth and O. Weber have shown by their recent experiments that\r\nthese injections are uniformly followed by fever, and, if\r\nsubcutaneous, by abscess; and further, that injections of fresh pus\r\nproduce even a higher temperature than do those of ichorous pus; but\r\nthe pus taken from cold abscesses has apparently very slight effect.\r\nThe fresh non-ichorous dried pus was found to possess in a similar\r\ndegree the power to excite inflammation and suppuration; even the\r\nremoval of the albumen did not change its character or power. It will\r\nbe observed that these injections caused not only local inflammations,\r\nbut severe constitutional symptoms, as high temperature, etc.\r\nExperiments have thus far completely failed to show the agent that\r\nexcites the inflammation, although it is generally admitted that it at\r\nleast exists in the molecular bodies.\r\n\r\nVirchow and Panum have shown conclusively by their experiments on\r\nliving animals that the introduction of foreign bodies into the {957}\r\nveins--as powdered coal, wax balls, and quicksilver--fail in all cases\r\nto produce metastatic abscesses in the visceral organs or symptoms of\r\npyæmia. These foreign bodies were frequently found blocking up the\r\nterminal branches of the pulmonary artery, in some cases encapsulated,\r\nfrequently resembling miliary tubercles, and occasionally surrounded\r\nby evidences of slight local inflammation, but in every instance\r\nwithout suppuration. The same experimenters, however, observed that\r\nthe introduction of ichorous pus and decomposing animal tissue into\r\nthe veins was attended with the formation of metastatic abscesses and\r\nother symptoms of pyæmia. They therefore conclude that the\r\nintroduction of putrid animal substances into the veins, and the\r\nfurther transport of the same to the branches of the pulmonary artery,\r\nproduce metastatic abscesses, and that the origin of these deposits is\r\nindependent of the mere stopping up of the branches of this artery.\r\n\r\nThe occlusion of the blood-vessels in this diseased condition is a\r\nsubject which has given rise to much discussion. Some of the earlier\r\nwriters supposed this phenomenon constituted the disease pyæmia, while\r\nothers believed it to be the essential cause. Roser says: \"But the\r\nthrombus is, as can be easily proved, not the cause, but only a\r\nsymptom, of pyæmia. If a surgical patient--_e.g._ one suffering with\r\nan injury of the head--is attacked by inflammation, and occlusion of a\r\nlarge vein, as of the common iliac vein, for instance, then there are\r\nthree different theories for the inflammation of the occluded\r\nvessel--viz. Hunter's, Rokitansky's, and Virchow's. According to the\r\nold Hunterian phlebitic theory, the coagulation of the blood should be\r\nthe result of the inflammation of the vein. On account of the\r\ncircumstances under which the coagulation of the blood in the vein has\r\noccurred, one might suppose that the cause must be the oozing of\r\ncoagulable exudation from the inflamed wall of the vein, but\r\npathological dissections, especially Rokitansky's, would not accord\r\nwith it. Large veins were found plugged up without the existence of\r\ncorresponding indications of inflammation, and perfectly clear\r\nindications were often present that occlusion had preceded the\r\ninflammation. Consequently, the occlusion of the vein was the primary\r\ncondition, and this must be explained in some other way than by its\r\ninflammation. Rokitansky in his theory recognized an independent\r\ndisease of the blood. Yet it does not appear, on examination of the\r\nmorbid conditions, that this theory can account for them. If it is\r\nrecognized as correct that a primary disease of the blood is to be\r\nadmitted, yet the coagulation of the blood in a large vein has not\r\nbeen traced back to it. It remained wholly unexplained why a single\r\nvein, especially one so large and strong as the common iliac, should\r\nbecome the seat of the local coagulation. The necessity of finding a\r\nlocal basis for the local coagulation could not be denied. For that\r\nreason it was greeted as a highly desirable advance when Virchow\r\npointed out that the occlusion of such large veins could be dependent\r\non the coagulation of the blood in the concave spaces behind the\r\nvalves of the veins, or through the coagulation in the small\r\nbranches--_e.g._ the hypogastric veins, which is gradually carried\r\nforward until it reaches the common iliac, and by continual increase\r\nthis vein may also be filled up. At the same time, it was demonstrated\r\nthat not infrequently, much oftener than {958} was formerly supposed,\r\nthe coagulated masses of blood are broken up and carried farther on in\r\nthe circulation, in this manner producing occlusion of the pulmonary\r\nartery or its branches.\"[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, Erst. Jahrg., Erst. Heft, S. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe examination of this subject finally brings Roser to this\r\nconclusion: \"Contamination of the blood is essentially the primary\r\ncause of pyæmia; thrombosis is only a result of this morbid\r\ncontamination, and cannot, therefore, be regarded as the cause of\r\npyæmia, but only as an apparent part, as one of the symptoms of the\r\nsame.\"[27] The opinion here expressed by Roser I believe to be the one\r\ngenerally entertained by the profession at this time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Ibid._, S. 43.]\r\n\r\nIn cases of pyæmia there are recognized two principal sources of\r\ncontamination of the blood--viz. the wound itself, and the vitiated\r\ncondition of the atmosphere surrounding the patient--contamination, in\r\nthe first place, directly from the wound through the blood-vessels;\r\nand in the second, by the passage of disease-germs or of the poisonous\r\nelements into the blood along the respiratory tract. E. Wagner says:\r\n\"The latest examinations in regard to the vegetable parasites have\r\nmade it very probable not only that these are the active agents, but\r\nalso--what has been clinically quite generally accepted--that\r\nsepticæmia and pyæmia owe their origin to different plants (the first\r\nto rod bacteria, the latter to globular bacteria); and, finally, that\r\nboth may combine.\"[28] These germs may be generated in the wound or be\r\nreceived into it from the surrounding atmosphere. The character of the\r\nwound and the conditions surrounding the patient thus become important\r\nsubjects for the consideration of the surgeon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Manual of General Pathology_, p. 593.]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, and is now generally admitted, that wounds\r\ncomplicated with a fracture of the long bones of the extremities,\r\nopening large medullary cavities and accompanied by extensive\r\nlaceration of the soft parts, always increase the danger of\r\nblood-poisoning. This fact may be more thoroughly understood by a\r\nbrief consideration of the condition of the parts. Frequently in open\r\nfractures large quantities of pus constantly remain in contact with\r\nthe surface of the wound, while detached fragments of bone, which\r\nbecome speedily necrosed, move about with every motion of the injured\r\nlimb, lacerating more or less the surrounding tissues, and thus\r\nexciting inflammation and suppuration. The periosteum becomes\r\ninflamed; a widespread suppurative periostitis is the result; necrosis\r\nof the bone from insufficient nutrition follows, while mechanical\r\npressure on the pus aids in its absorption. The medulla frequently\r\ntakes on suppurative inflammation, and here the surgeon fails to\r\nreceive prompt warning of danger; slowly the suppuration progresses,\r\nwithout pain or other symptoms unless the disease has extended to the\r\nother tissues; the medullary cavity at the fractured end of the bone\r\nmay be completely or partially occluded by a new osseous formation;\r\nand in such cases the absorption of pus by the comparatively large\r\nvenous vessels of this cavity is greatly facilitated.\r\n\r\nThe soft parts may also be the seat of dangerous trouble. The same\r\nforce that produced the wound and fracture may have also contused the\r\nsoft parts, destroying in a greater or less degree their nutrition,\r\nthus giving rise to gangrenous sloughs, or in other cases to the\r\nformation of abscesses, etc. I will also call attention to the fact\r\nthat the laudable pus {959} in these cases is most favorably situated\r\nfor a rapid change into that commonly called ichorous. The heat of the\r\nparts and the contact of the pus with the atmosphere will not fail to\r\neffect its rapid decomposition.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY OF SPONTANEOUS PYÆMIA.--It is unquestionable that cases of\r\ntrue pyæmia have been observed in which the etiology was not traceable\r\nto a wound; and it is equally certain that this failure to discover\r\nsuch a source of contamination in the majority of cases is no proof\r\nthat it did not exist. When it is remembered that a large portion of\r\nthe alimentary canal, the respiratory and the genito-urinary tracts,\r\nare so situated that the existence of a contaminating wound might be\r\nabsolutely undiscoverable, we are compelled to admit the possibility\r\nof a local centre of contamination in all these cases. But the\r\nquestion may be asked here with propriety, \"Is fatal pyæmia,\r\nindependent of a wound, ever produced by breathing vitiated air?\" The\r\nanswers to this question must generally be a negative, although it is\r\ncertainly true that poisoning of the blood does take place to a\r\ncertain degree, as is abundantly shown by the different symptoms\r\narising in patients thus exposed who are not suffering with wounds. It\r\nis said that dogs exposed in this way are found to rapidly emaciate\r\nand suffer from severe and constant diarrhoea. The various symptoms\r\narising in patients confined in overcrowded and pus-infected wards,\r\namong which may be mentioned loss of appetite, with diarrhoea and\r\nemaciation, are too well known to require an enumeration here.\r\nTherefore it appears highly probable that living in and breathing a\r\nvitiated atmosphere may act as a strongly predisposing cause, only\r\nrequiring a slight scratch or abrasion of the skin, in which the\r\ninfection may be said to act as an exciting cause of pyæmia.\r\n\r\nIn reference to such complications the following questions are asked\r\nby Roser: \"Is it a specific deleterious material, a miasmatic or\r\ncontagious disease-poison, or, as it is generally expressed, a zymotic\r\nagent? Must we regard each particular typhus-like fever, with its\r\nremarkable changes of blood, with its various localizations in all the\r\norgans and membranes, with its chills, furred tongue, petechiæ,\r\ndelirium, etc., as we regard typhus, scarlatina, variola, etc.? or, as\r\nVirchow teaches us, is this pyæmia, so greatly feared by all surgeons,\r\nonly an ontological idea? Is the word pyæmia only a general name for\r\nthree different conditions--viz. leucocythæmia, thrombosis, and\r\nembolism, or ichorrhæmia and septicæmia? or are there, as many have\r\nsupposed, two ways in which pyæmia may originate? Is there one primary\r\nmiasmatic pyæmia analogous to the other epidemic, so-called zymotic\r\ndiseases? and again, a secondary pyæmia arising from suppurative\r\ninflammation, wherein the poison is formed in the patient's own body,\r\nwhich is infected by a single organ?\"[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Loc. cit._, S. 39.]\r\n\r\nThat this disease is caused by a specific deleterious material in the\r\nlarge majority of cases is no longer a question for discussion. The\r\nonly question to consider is, whether it always arises from the same\r\ncause. Is it possible for pyæmia to originate spontaneously? Are there\r\nany cases of sporadic origin, or are they always due to endemic or\r\ncontagious influences? No definite answer can be given to these\r\nquestions, although, undeniably, the weight of the argument is\r\nstrongly opposed to a sporadic origin. The term miasmatic, as {960}\r\nused by Roser, probably refers to the vitiated condition of the\r\natmosphere, as seen in the overcrowded surgical and obstetrical wards\r\nof hospitals. In no other sense can the word be appropriately used in\r\nconnection with the subject of pyæmia. It is true, pyæmic diseases are\r\nfound to prevail at certain seasons and in certain localities much\r\nmore extensively than under other circumstances. The same, however, is\r\ntrue of cholera, typhus fever, scarlatina, variola, and other\r\ncontagious diseases. That pyæmia is contagious has been frequently\r\ndemonstrated. I therefore conclude that the prevalence and spread of\r\nthis disease must be explained by the same rules as are applied to the\r\nexistence and propagation of these allied affections.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry into the etiology of pyæmia brings before us again the\r\nfour hypotheses which have been given in explanation of the same\r\nnumber of theories. The first and second have been already abandoned\r\nby the medical profession, after it was satisfactorily demonstrated\r\nthat they were based on false theories, and consequently there remain\r\nfor our consideration only the third and fourth.\r\n\r\nThe third hypothesis assumes that a chemical poison is developed in\r\nthe wound-secretions, which when absorbed produces pyæmia. An\r\nexamination of the subject does not justify us in asserting that this\r\nproposition has been proved, although it is certain that the results\r\nof experimental inquiry demand for it a more extended investigation.\r\nIn all the analyses which have thus far been made the investigators\r\nhave entirely failed to give us an adequate knowledge of this poison,\r\nand not a word has ever been said in regard to the agency by which it\r\nis produced, although it is universally admitted to have been only\r\nobtained from decomposing animal substances. It is therefore pertinent\r\nto the continuation of this inquiry to ask, By what agency is the\r\nputrefaction of animal substances produced? It has now been fully\r\nshown that there can be but one answer given to this question--viz.\r\nthe putrefaction of albuminoid substances can only be effected by\r\nliving organisms. We therefore conclude that the fourth hypothesis\r\nbrings us at least one step nearer the correct explanation of the\r\netiology of pyæmia than the third, since we justly assume that if\r\nthere is a chemical poison in decomposing albuminoid substances, it is\r\nproduced through the agency of living organisms.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY OF SEPTICÆMIA.--The first question which arises in the\r\ndiscussion of the etiology of this morbid condition is entirely\r\ndependent on the scope which we give to the word septicæmia. Sternberg\r\nsays: \"The view which is entertained by high authorities, upon\r\nclinical and experimental evidence, is that there are two forms of\r\nsepticæmia--the one a septic toxæmia due to the effects of a chemical\r\npoison or poisons evolved during the putrefactive decomposition of\r\ncertain organic substances, especially of nitrogenous animal products;\r\nthe other an infective disease produced by the rapid multiplication in\r\nthe body of the infected animal of a parasitic organism. The\r\nbest-studied and most widely known form of septicæmia, due to the\r\npresence of a parasitic organism, is the disease known as\r\nanthrax--charbon of the French, milzbrand of the Germans--but several\r\nother varieties are now well established, in which similar symptoms\r\nand pathological results are produced by organisms morphologically\r\ndifferent from the bacillus anthracis. Among these may {961} be\r\nmentioned the form of septicæmia in the mouse, so well studied by\r\nKoch, which is due to a minute bacillus, and the form of septicæmia in\r\nthe rabbit, produced by the subcutaneous injections of human saliva,\r\ndue to micrococci, which has been studied by Pasteur, Vulpian, and\r\nmyself independently.\"[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Amer. Jour. Med. Sci._, July, 1882, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nThe terms septic toxæmia and septic intoxication are applied\r\nindiscriminately to the same disease, and the committee appointed by\r\nthe London Pathological Society to investigate the nature and cause of\r\nthose infectious diseases known as septicæmia, etc. further report\r\nthat \"ordinary wound-fever is merely septic intoxication in a very\r\nmild form, and it is only necessary for the dose absorbed to be\r\nsufficient in quantity for fatal consequences to ensue. Septic\r\nintoxication is, therefore, of the commonest possible occurrence as a\r\ncomplication of severe surgical injuries, but it is in so mild a form\r\nas to bear but little resemblance to that experimentally produced on\r\nanimals.\"[31] The question which now arises is, Shall septic\r\nintoxication be classified with septicæmia?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Trans. Pathological Soc. of London_, vol. xxx. p. 14.]\r\n\r\nWe have been long accustomed to speak of this complication as a\r\nsurgical or traumatic fever; and consequently any change in this\r\nclassification must necessarily lead to confusion. Furthermore, it is\r\nnow generally supposed there is much difference in the etiology of\r\nthese morbid conditions. It is claimed that septic intoxication arises\r\nfrom the absorption of a chemical poison evolved through the agency of\r\nliving organisms during the process of putrefaction in a wound, and\r\nthat the conditions are unfavorable for their development within the\r\nblood or tissues of a living animal; but in true septicæmia the\r\norganisms are developed in the wound during putrefaction, and then\r\nfind their way into the blood and tissues of the body, where they\r\nrapidly multiply. Consequently, the former condition tends to a rapid\r\nrecovery--unless the quantity of poison primarily admitted to the\r\nsystem has been excessive--while the latter tends to a fatal\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nSeptic intoxication is regarded as a non-infective disease, and true\r\nsepticæmia as an infective malady. The only etiological similarity\r\nbetween these morbid conditions is found in the fact that they take\r\ntheir origin in putrefaction, which is effected by the action of\r\ndifferent organisms possessing marked morphological differences and\r\nrequiring essentially different surroundings for the maintenance of\r\nlife and reproduction. Thus, it is supposed that in cases of septic\r\nintoxication the organism by which putrefaction is caused in the\r\nwound-secretions can only live in the open air, and that its life is\r\ncommonly only of a few hours' duration. The brevity of bacterial\r\naction in this instance may be due to a failure of the absorptive\r\npower or to a changed condition in the wound-fluids, rendering them\r\nunfit to support the organism.\r\n\r\nIt is now a well-recognized fact that all septic absorption ends so\r\nsoon as the wound-surfaces are covered with healthy granulations, but\r\nthat septic absorption, which produces septic intoxication, is most\r\ncommonly of a much shorter duration, and, consequently, that the wound\r\ncomplication, which I prefer to designate traumatic fever, is\r\nessentially an acute disease, and can only be lengthened out by\r\nunusually favorable circumstances for the continuance of the\r\nabsorption of the poison by which it is produced. {962} The severity\r\nand danger of the disease will necessarily depend on the amount of\r\npoison absorbed and the resisting power of the patient; but since\r\nthere is no multiplication of the materies morbi within the body, a\r\nrapid elimination by the natural emunctories may be reasonably\r\nexpected under favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed here that the etiology of septicæmia differs\r\nfrom that of traumatic fever, since the organisms in the former\r\ncondition are first formed in the wound-secretions, but quickly enter\r\nthe body, where they rapidly multiply; consequently, Chauvel has\r\ndefined surgical septicæmia as follows: \"The particular intoxication\r\nwhich results from the penetration and multiplication in the body of a\r\nspecific microbe designated by Pasteur under the name of septic\r\nvibrio.\" The bacterial origin of this disease is now generally\r\naccepted, and the only question in the professional mind seems to be\r\nwhether the organisms are the direct or indirect cause of the malady.\r\n\r\nThere are also some other interesting questions which have arisen in\r\nconnection with the study of this subject, and are thought to be of\r\nsufficient importance to merit mention here. It has long been known\r\nthat dissecting wounds are most dangerous when made while examining\r\nthe body very soon after the death of the subject. Recent observations\r\nseem to justify the conclusion that the greatest activity of the\r\nseptic agent is often, if not always, attained before the odor of\r\nputrefaction has become fairly perceptible; and even before this odor\r\nhas reached its maximum degree of offensiveness the danger from septic\r\npoisoning has generally disappeared. In some cases septic intoxication\r\nis promptly followed by a slight inflammation in and about the wound,\r\nwhich may entirely disappear within a few hours, but only to reappear\r\nafter a lapse of eight to fifteen days, with the first vigorous\r\nphysical exercise of the patient. Two cases of this kind have recently\r\ncome under my observation. In both instances the wounds were located\r\nin the hands, and the exercise which developed the septicæmia\r\nconsisted in rowing a boat, and while thus engaged the local symptoms\r\nreappeared with such severity as to cause the patients to quickly\r\ndiscontinue the labor. The reappearance of the local inflammation in\r\nboth these instances was quickly followed by a rigor and the rapid\r\ndevelopment of other constitutional symptoms, although prior to the\r\nrecurrence there was no pus, nor even marked inflammatory action, in\r\nany part of the hands.\r\n\r\nProfessional attention was first called to the above-stated facts by\r\nPanum in 1855, who discovered that the maximum toxic action of putrid\r\nsubstances is generally developed during the first hours of bodily\r\nactivity. In this stage of incubation in cases of surgical septicæmia,\r\nif we admit the bodily action as an etiological factor, we observe a\r\nstriking resemblance to one of the leading characteristics of all the\r\ninfectious diseases, which unquestionably depend on some sort of\r\nseptic poison. Furthermore, this analogy becomes most striking if we\r\ncontrast the effects arising from dissecting wounds with those of the\r\nbites of poisonous serpents and rabid animals.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation is required to settle the perplexing questions\r\nof etiological and pathological differences in these allied morbid\r\nconditions, for although much has been accomplished during the last\r\ntwo decades, still much more remains to be done. It has only recently\r\nbeen discovered {963} that the septic material in septicæmia is\r\nabsorbed by the lymphatics, while in pyæmia the poison enters the body\r\nthrough the veins.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY OF SEPTO-PYÆMIA.--It is now generally admitted that remittent\r\nfever and typhoid may be associated, and this morbid condition is\r\ncommonly designated by the term typho-malarial fever. The etiology is\r\nunquestionably dependent upon the action of the two distinct and\r\nentirely dissimilar poisons. Scarlatina is likewise frequently\r\ncomplicated by diphtheria, and here we have the combined action of two\r\npoisons, each commonly designated as septic and supposed by many\r\nphysicians to be similar.\r\n\r\nIn a like manner, it is believed that septicæmia and pyæmia may be\r\nassociated, and take their origin in dual poisons; but since the\r\netiology of both these morbid conditions has been already described,\r\nit is not deemed necessary to dwell longer on septo-pyæmia under this\r\ndivision of our subject.\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY OF PYÆMIA.--The study of the pathology of pyæmia is advanced\r\nby adopting the following classification, which is based on recognized\r\npost-mortem lesions. The pathological appearances in these forms of\r\nthe disease differ widely, although the clinical symptoms are often\r\nsimilar. In pyæmia simplex the pathological conditions are essentially\r\nmore negative. This variety of the disease can only destroy life by\r\nthe height and duration of the fever which is maintained in connection\r\nwith the continued existence of ichorous pus. There is found, as an\r\nessential basis of this form of disease, extensive suppuration in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favor of the admission of pus-corpuscles into the\r\nblood are as follows: 1. The blood in pyæmia is known to contain more\r\nwhite granular spherical bodies than are normal. The question has been\r\nraised, Are they pus-cells or white blood-corpuscles? The answer is\r\ndifficult, and has not yet been attained. Virchow, in the mean time,\r\nhas proved that we cannot differentiate, morphologically, between the\r\nblood- and pus-corpuscles. 2. Cohnheim has demonstrated the existence\r\nof the wandering corpuscles in cases of inflammation. Therefore it\r\nappears probable that in cases of pyæmia the blood may contain the\r\npus-corpuscles, but further investigation is needed to establish this\r\nfact. However, the establishment of this point would still leave the\r\nmore important undetermined.\r\n\r\nThere are often important changes observed in the blood of patients\r\ndead of pyæmia, to which I now desire to direct attention. The red\r\ncorpuscles of the blood, even in the early stage of the disease, in\r\nmany cases show signs of disintegrating into molecules, and are\r\nobserved to be accumulated in masses without showing the slightest\r\ntendency to form rouleaux. There is a steady increase in the number of\r\npus- or white corpuscles in the blood of pyæmic patients during the\r\nwhole course of the disease in fatal cases. The condition of the red\r\ncorpuscles, already mentioned, becomes more and more marked toward the\r\nfatal termination.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of pyæmia multiplex the increased coagulability of the\r\nblood may be observed in the early stages of the disease, and steadily\r\nincreases as the disease progresses.\r\n\r\nIn pyæmia simplex this condition is less marked, although generally\r\npresent, \"while we know septicæmia diminishes or destroys the {964}\r\ncoagulability of the blood. Hereby the possibility is given, at least\r\non the cadaver, to differentiate between pyæmia simplex and\r\nsepticæmia, although cases occur of the more fatal septic infection in\r\nwhich the post-mortem condition is a complete or almost complete\r\nnegative. Therefore, in these cases the differential diagnosis on the\r\ncadaver must be limited to this, that we are able to demonstrate the\r\nexistence of a purulent or ichorous deposit.\" It will be readily\r\nobserved that the difference in diagnosis mentioned above relates to\r\npyæmia and septicæmia, and not to the different varieties of the\r\nformer disease.\r\n\r\nThe following facts should be constantly kept in mind by the surgeon\r\nto enable him to differentiate between the two forms of pyæmia: In\r\npure cases of purulent infection, without metastasis, the disease is\r\ncalled pyæmia simplex, and in cases with metastasis, pyæmia multiplex.\r\nThe various conditions on which the metastasis may depend are shown by\r\nHueter, who says: \"The metastatic abscesses of pyæmia multiplex met\r\nwith in the lungs, liver, spleen, and other internal organs are\r\nregarded, with the greatest probability, as a result of the embolic\r\nprocess. The metastatic inflammation of the serous membranes, of the\r\ncellular tissues, and of the parotid glands, and probably also a few\r\nmetastatic inflammations of the internal organs, are at present\r\nsupposed to arise from a general inflammatory diathesis.\"[32] It has\r\nalready been shown by numerous experiments on animals that metastatic\r\nabscesses in the lungs, liver, and other visceral organs only arise\r\nafter the introduction of ichorous pus, while healthy pus has\r\nuniformly failed to produce these results.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Billroth's _Handbuch der Chirurgie_, S. 88.]\r\n\r\nIt now remains to be shown how the introduction of ichorous pus acts\r\nin the production of pyæmia multiplex. The ichorous pus, having found\r\nits way into the venous circulation, gives rise to the formation of\r\nthrombi in the veins; these clots become more or less broken up, and\r\nare carried forward by the blood to the right auricle; from this\r\nauricle to the right ventricle; from this ventricle to the pulmonary\r\nartery, and through its ramifications to every part of the lungs. In\r\nthe minute ramifications of this vessel are found wedge-shaped clots\r\nof various sizes in different conditions, some softened and others\r\nstill firm. The possibility of these clots ever passing through the\r\nlungs, and afterward being arrested in other visceral organs, has been\r\ndemonstrated on animals. It has been shown that fine particles of\r\nforeign matter injected into the veins have passed through the lungs\r\nand subsequently lodged in the liver. This theory enables us to\r\naccount, upon a mechanical basis, for the existence of the metastatic\r\nabscesses in the liver which have apparently originated as the result\r\nof primary infection.\r\n\r\nIn other cases these abscesses are supposed to arise from secondary\r\ninfection. Thus, ichorous pus, having found its way into the venous\r\ncirculation, produces primarily venous thrombi, which, as in other\r\ninstances, break up, the clots being carried in the same manner into\r\nthe terminal branches of the pulmonary artery, where they are\r\ndesignated as emboli. The first action of the emboli is the mechanical\r\nclosure of these vessels, thus depriving the surrounding parts of\r\nnutrition to a greater or less extent. It will be proper now to recall\r\nthe fact that the composition of these emboli is such as to favor\r\nrapid suppuration; this commonly commences {965} in the clot and\r\nsurrounding tissues, having been preceded by a brief stage of\r\ncongestion and inflammation. There is also occasionally found around\r\nthese points more or less extravasation. The metastatic abscess thus\r\nformed in the lungs is favorably situated for the production of\r\nsecondary infection. From this abscess thrombi arise in the pulmonary\r\nveins, which become disintegrated, and are carried to the auricle,\r\nthence to the left ventricle, and finally through the aorta, and find\r\nlodgment in the terminal branches of the arteries of the various\r\norgans, where they produce the characteristic lesions.\r\n\r\nThe organs which most frequently become the seat of this secondary\r\ninfection are the liver, spleen, kidneys, brain, and eyes.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly examine this mechanical theory. Do metastatic\r\nabscesses arise from a single cause or from a combination of causes? I\r\nam inclined to the opinion that the proximal cause of metastatic\r\nabscesses in the visceral organs is the existence of emboli in the\r\nterminal branches. The vitiated atmosphere surrounding the patient,\r\nthe existence of a wound, and the formation of ichorous pus are\r\nconditions which should not be lost sight of. These are the elements\r\nacting on the blood, producing in it morbid changes, and may therefore\r\nbe regarded as predisposing causes. The morbid conditions of the\r\nblood, the increased number of white blood-corpuscles (possibly pus),\r\nthe disintegration and other changes in the red corpuscles, may be\r\nregarded as the exciting causes of metastatic abscesses. It is thus\r\nreadily observed that emboli may form in the lungs and liver at the\r\nsame time, or the origin of those in the lungs may precede the\r\nformation in other organs.\r\n\r\nIs the formation of emboli in the terminal branches of arteries always\r\ndependent on the disintegration of thrombi? The answer to this\r\nquestion must, I think, be a negative, although in surgical practice\r\nit rarely happens that the emboli take their origin from any other\r\ncause. In the large majority of cases, unquestionably, the thrombi\r\nprimarily exist in the vicinity of the wound in which ichorous pus is\r\ngenerated; but it not infrequently happens during the process of\r\ndisintegration that broken-up clots are carried forward by the current\r\nof blood, receiving accretions on the way, until finally they fill a\r\nlarge venous trunk. In confirmation of these facts relating to the\r\nprimary origin of thrombi, it is said to have been observed in\r\nepidemics of puerperal fever, which were complicated with metastatic\r\nabscesses of the visceral organs, that the thrombi occurred in the\r\npelvic veins. In case of wounds of the lower extremity the clot is\r\nfrequently found in the common iliac vein, although probably it should\r\nalways be regarded as a secondary formation. In rare cases the only\r\nthrombi discovered at the autopsy are found situated far away from the\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nObservation fully establishes the fact that, after death from pyæmia,\r\npathological changes are much more frequently met with in the lungs\r\nthan in any of the other organs. This certainly strengthens the\r\nembolic theory. Billroth mentions eighty-three cases of true pyæmia\r\nmultiplex, in which the metastatic abscesses occurred as follows:\r\nseventy-five times in the lungs, seventeen times in the spleen, eight\r\ntimes in the liver, and four times in the kidneys. Sedillot remarks\r\nthat in one hundred cases of pyæmia we find the lungs affected in\r\nninety-nine, the liver and spleen in eight, the muscles in seven, and\r\nthe heart and peripheric {966} cellular tissue in five cases. The\r\nbrain and kidneys are comparatively seldom involved.\r\n\r\nThe theory previously mentioned as the embolic relates to the\r\naggregation of fibrin into clots; but another theory has been recently\r\nadvanced by E. Wagner, who found in many cases the capillaries in the\r\nlungs filled with fat, and was inclined, from the direction it\r\nextended in these vessels, to explain a certain number of the pyæmic\r\ncases by the fat emboli; but it has been shown that the existence of\r\nthe fat emboli in pyæmia is purely accidental and possesses no\r\nsignificance. Pyæmia multiplex very frequently occurs without fat\r\nemboli, and vice versâ; either process may complicate the other, and\r\nso the fat emboli may acquire special importance by obstructing the\r\nrespiration, and probably also in their way the embolic fat may serve\r\nas a carrier of putrid material.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The external appearance of the body varies greatly.\r\nThe skin, in those cases in which the patient was jaundiced before\r\ndeath, will be found in every part of the body to be of a dark orange\r\nor dirty icteric tinge, but in other cases it may present a pale or\r\nanæmic appearance. There are also sometimes found circumscribed\r\necchymoses or purpuric patches, while the edges of ulcers or open\r\nwounds are generally of a blackish or dirty yellow color. The lips and\r\nfinger-nails present a livid appearance; epithelial defects are\r\nobserved in the cornea, but these had their origin there before the\r\ndeath of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe eyes in some cases are sunken deeply in their sockets, and where\r\nthe disease has been protracted there is often very great emaciation.\r\nRigor mortis is commonly well marked after a few hours. When death\r\noccurs from puerperal pyæmia there are generally found some\r\nindications of the recent parturition, although the principal\r\nlacerations or injuries may be confined to the womb. All fluids\r\ndisappear from external wounds before the death of the patient, and\r\nthey remain dry afterward.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the cellular tissue is the seat of diffuse suppuration.\r\nThe pus formed is thin, fetid, and unhealthy. This suppuration is\r\nlimited to certain parts of the body, as an injured extremity, or, as\r\nfrequently happens, it may be found on the trunk and limbs at the same\r\ntime. The pus in this form of suppuration is exceedingly apt to\r\nburrow, on account of the peculiarities of the tissue in which it\r\noccurs, and also the condition of the surrounding structures,\r\nespecially the relaxed and flabby condition of the skin. These\r\nabscesses in some instances are superficial, in others deep-seated.\r\n\r\nThere are few changes which occur in the muscles, and these are not\r\nuniform or constant. They are occasionally the seat of abscesses,\r\nwhich have been observed in the heart, tongue, and other organs. The\r\nmuscles may be of a light-brown or greenish color when they have been\r\ncovered a considerable time with pus, and are sometimes softened and\r\npultaceous. Suppuration may also take place beneath the fascia of the\r\ntendons.\r\n\r\nThe brain and its membranes are frequently found in a perfectly\r\nhealthy state after death from pyæmia, although when the diseased\r\nprocess has extended during the life of the patient to the lungs and\r\npleura, giving rise to great dyspnoea, there will generally be\r\nobserved some congestion of the membranes, an increased quantity of\r\nfluid in the brain-substance and ventricles, and also an increased\r\nfulness of the meningeal veins and sinuses. Occasionally there have\r\nbeen observed suppurative {967} meningitis, blood extravasations on\r\nthe surface of the brain, lymph-deposits on the membranes, softening\r\nof the cerebral tissues, and circumscribed abscesses in the substance\r\nof the brain, which in some cases have been traceable to embolism of\r\nits vessels. The changes in the spinal cord and its membranes are\r\nprobably similar to those found in the brain, but these parts appear\r\nto have been rarely examined.\r\n\r\nVirchow found emboli of the retinal and choroidal vessels. Heiberg\r\nfound these vessels occluded with colonies of micrococci. There have\r\nalso been observed opacity of the cornea, sloughing of the\r\nconjunctival epithelium, suppurative infiltration into the periphery\r\nof the vitreous body, and deposits of pus in Petit's canal and in the\r\nanterior and posterior chambers. Pyæmic ophthalmia has been observed\r\nsomewhat frequently in puerperal cases, especially when preceded by\r\nendocarditis, with deposits on the semilunar or mitral valves. In\r\nsurgical cases it is rarely seen.\r\n\r\nToynbee \"relates several cases of purulent infection following\r\nsuppuration of the ear. Cases of disease in the mastoid cells\r\nterminate fatally, he says, from two different causes: first, from\r\npurulent infection, arising from the introduction of pus into the\r\ncirculation through the lateral sinus; second, from disease of the\r\ncerebellum or its membranes. Cases of purulent infection, he further\r\nremarks, have not been met with where the disease occurs in the\r\ntympanic cavity.\"[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Braidwood on _Pyæmia_, pp. 168, 169.]\r\n\r\nNumerous lesions of the osseous system have been noted in pyæmia,\r\nprobably from the fact that this disease results very frequently in\r\ncases of bone-lesions, but these changes have very little diagnostic\r\nimportance. The following have been observed: thickening or\r\ninfiltration of the periosteum, which may be found to separate readily\r\nfrom the bone after the death of the patient, or there may be pus\r\nfound between the periosteum and the bone. In the bone-structure there\r\nwere found caries and necrosis, \"while in other cases the whole\r\nthickness of the compact tissue is perforated in a honeycomb-like\r\nmanner by minute cavities filled with thickish pus or caseous matter\r\nof a pinkish-white color.\"[35] \"To sum up, the chief morbid\r\nalterations met with in the bones are congestion, dilatation of the\r\nHaversian canals and cancellated tissue, tending to abscess formation,\r\nand the excavation of the cavities by the unhealthy pus.\"[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Ibid._, p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Ibid._, p. 194.]\r\n\r\nThe pathological lesions of the joints commence with marked congestion\r\nof the synovial membranes and increase in the synovial fluids, and\r\nafterward the fluid is mixed with pus; these conditions are followed\r\nby erosion of the cartilage and ligaments, the former thus becoming\r\nseparated from the bone. Both the small and large joints are\r\noccasionally the seat of morbid changes.\r\n\r\nThe parotid gland is occasionally the seat of a secondary inflammation\r\nduring the progress of pyæmia, and this may endanger life by\r\ninterfering with respiration and deglutition. The lymphatic glands are\r\nonly secondarily affected, and even this takes place very rarely. The\r\nchanges in the glandular system, when observed, are similar to those\r\nwhich happen in other tissues of the body--viz. congestion,\r\ninflammation, and suppuration.\r\n\r\nThe arteries are usually found empty after death from this disease,\r\nand the coats are sometimes apparently thickened. The veins, on the\r\ncontrary, are commonly found filled, or even distended, with firm\r\nfibrinous clots. They are sometimes also found inflamed or altered,\r\nalthough more {968} commonly healthy. The distended condition of the\r\nveins gives rise to the cord-like feeling often mentioned by different\r\nobservers. In some cases of phlebitis there may be pus deposited\r\nbetween the coats of these veins. The most important pathological\r\nchanges are found in the blood. These changes occur early in the\r\ndisease, become more marked toward its fatal termination, and may be\r\nalways studied after death. It is generally admitted that pus is\r\nfrequently found in the blood of these patients; but it has been shown\r\nby numerous experiments that healthy pus never produces the\r\npathological changes which characterize this disease. Pyæmia is only\r\nproduced by the presence in the blood of ichorous pus or some other\r\ndecomposing animal substance, or some material having its origin in\r\nthe decomposition of the same, and no decomposition in these\r\nsubstances is ever effected except through the agency of living\r\norganisms. It therefore follows that the discovery of living organisms\r\nin the blood of those sick and dead of this disease has given a\r\nrenewed interest to the study of its pathology. The recent\r\ninvestigations made by Pasteur, Koch, Birch-Hirschfeld, and the London\r\nPathological Society show conclusively that in all cases of pyæmia and\r\nsepticæmia organisms are present in the blood during the entire course\r\nof the disease, and that in the former there is found the globular,\r\nand in the latter the rod bacteria. It has further been observed in\r\neach morbid condition that the severity of the disease is always\r\nincreased in proportion to the increase of the organisms in the blood,\r\nand that the bacteria found within the body are of the same species as\r\nthose in the wound from which they have gained admission. The\r\nmicrococci found in the blood of pyæmic patients are surrounded by the\r\ndecomposed products of the red and white corpuscles, which appear in\r\nthe blood-plasma in the form of pale granular bodies. There is\r\nlikewise in this disease an increased coagulability of the blood, and\r\nit steadily increases as the disease progresses. In this condition\r\nthere may be found in the blood-vessels both thrombi and emboli. The\r\nthrombi are occasionally observed as firm fibrinous clots, but they\r\nmay be likewise found in the rapidly fatal cases to have undergone\r\nsuppurative changes. These changes begin in the centre of the clots,\r\nwhich often contain true pus or a greenish or puriform fluid.\r\n\r\nThe pericardium may contain a small amount of serum tinged with blood,\r\nbut it is seldom covered with recent lymph. Both the lung-tissue and\r\npleuræ are commonly inflamed in this disease. The costal and visceral\r\nlayers may be agglutinated by old adhesions, but are more commonly\r\nunited together by recently formed lymph. The pleural cavities often\r\ncontain some opaque, muddy, sero-purulent fluid, mixed with blood and\r\nhaving masses of lymph floating in it.\r\n\r\nThe lungs are more frequently the seat of metastatic abscesses and\r\nother morbid changes in pyæmia multiplex than any other organs of the\r\nbody. There may be found emboli in the branches of the pulmonary\r\nveins, and in the lung-tissue metastatic abscesses surrounded with\r\ncapillary congestion and other evidences of inflammation; \"The smaller\r\nvessels, trying to overcome this afflux of blood, may produce\r\necchymosis or extravasation beneath the lining membrane of the\r\nair-vesicles, but the minute capillary congestions are generally\r\nobserved as red points studded over the pulmonary surface, which by\r\nand by exhibit yellowish-white or bluish-white centres. While one\r\npart, generally the lower half of the {969} lung, is thus hepatized,\r\nsolid, and of a dark greenish color, the remainder of the lung is\r\nemphysematous and more or less oedematous. A section of the former\r\npresents the same appearance as is observed in the lungs of pneumonic\r\npatients. Whether these incipient abscesses are developed from the\r\nminute points of congestion before mentioned, by the breaking down of\r\nthe thrombic clots in their centres, or whether the pus is developed\r\nout of the serum exuded by the walls of the engorged capillaries,\r\ncannot be easily determined, and has as yet not been decided. These\r\nsecondary abscesses vary in size from that of a hemp-seed to that of a\r\nhen's egg.\"[37] These are generally situated on the periphery of the\r\nlungs and in the lower lobe, although in some cases they are found\r\nimbedded deeply in the pulmonary tissue. The contents of these\r\nabscesses are similar to those found in other parts of the body in\r\nthis disease. The bronchial mucous membrane is commonly of a bright\r\npink color, while its secretion is increased in quantity, and may be\r\nclear and frothy. These changes are the result of acute bronchial\r\ncatarrh. Lobular pneumonia has been frequently observed as a\r\ncomplication of pyæmia, and is supposed by some authors to be caused\r\nby the vitiated condition of the blood; but probably it is more\r\nfrequently occasioned by infarctions and embolic abscesses, which have\r\nbeen previously mentioned in this connection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Braidwood, _op. cit._, p. 173 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nBillroth and Sedillot observed pathological lesions involving a\r\nsolution of continuity in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, in the order\r\nin which they are mentioned; other authors, however, assert that the\r\nliver, next to the lungs, is the most frequent seat of purulent\r\ndeposits. Enlargement of the spleen is frequently met with in cases of\r\npyæmia multiplex. The metastatic abscesses found in the spleen and\r\nkidneys are much smaller than those found in the lungs and liver, but\r\nin other respects are of a similar character. The capillary congestion\r\nand the accompanying infarctions require no special attention here.\r\nThe liver, like the spleen, is sometimes enlarged, and at other times\r\nis found to have undergone fatty degeneration to a greater or less\r\ndegree; in which condition its tissues are generally soft and friable.\r\nAbscesses in the liver are so much like those in the lungs as to need\r\nno separate description. The same may be said of other pathological\r\nchanges found in this organ in pyæmia multiplex. The abscesses found\r\nin the kidneys vary from the size of a hemp-seed to that of a bean,\r\nand are surrounded by the usual zone, marking more or less definitely\r\nthe extent of the inflammation. The capsule is generally healthy.\r\nThere are also, in very rare cases of this disease, abscesses found in\r\nthe stomach and intestines, involving the thickness of the mucous\r\nmembrane; and it is further supposed that these abscesses may be found\r\noccasionally on any portion of the mucous membrane lining the\r\nalimentary canal. Post-mortem examinations in pyæmia multiplex have\r\nestablished the fact that there is no organ in the body that may not\r\nbecome the seat of pathological lesions in this disease; but there is\r\nunquestionably a vast difference in the relative frequency of these\r\nchanges in the various organs. In some instances of this disease\r\nperitonitis is developed, with its concomitant changes in this\r\nmembrane and the abdominal fluid, which is generally increased in\r\nquantity and sometimes slightly tinged with blood, but more frequently\r\nremains clear. {970} This inflammation is commonly dependent on an\r\nextension of the inflammatory process from a metastatic abscess, which\r\nmay be situated near the periphery of some organ covered with\r\nperitoneum, although it is claimed that pleuritis occasionally occurs\r\nin connection with pyæmia independent of metastatic abscesses in the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nThe careful study of the pathology of pyæmia multiplex renders it\r\nexceedingly probable that the immediate agency in the production of\r\nall these lesions is the presence in the blood of a particular species\r\nof living organism, and that all the morbid changes which occur in the\r\nvisceral organs are secondary to those which take place in the blood,\r\nbut that the former are only dependent on the latter in a minor\r\ndegree. The pathological changes effected by these organisms seem to\r\nbe as follows, and to occur in the following order: viz.\r\ndisorganization of the blood, especially a destruction of the red and\r\nwhite blood-corpuscles; the formation of granular bodies around the\r\norganisms out of this débris; the production of an increased\r\ncoagulability of the blood; the lodgment in the blood-vessels of these\r\ngranular bodies, which are increased in size by a deposit of fibrin;\r\nthese obstructions occur most frequently in minute ramifications of\r\nthe pulmonary arteries; nutrition is effected locally by these\r\ninfarctions, and generally by the vitiated condition of the blood,\r\nwhich enables the organisms under these favorable circumstances to\r\npenetrate the adjacent tissues and produce the metastatic abscesses\r\nand other accompanying lesions.\r\n\r\nThe pathological changes in pyæmia simplex are of the same kind as\r\nthose which have just been described as characterizing pyæmia\r\nmultiplex, with the exception of the metastatic abscesses, which are\r\nalways absent. Furthermore, the disease in both instances is believed\r\nto have its origin from the same causes, and the dissimilarities in\r\nthe pathological lesions are equally susceptible of a rational\r\nexplanation, as are those of scarlatina simplex and scarlatina\r\nmaligna.\r\n\r\nThere were reported by the committee of the London Pathological\r\nSociety some interesting details pertaining to this form of pyæmia.\r\nTheir report shows that among the one hundred and fifty-five cases\r\nclassed as pyæmia there were twenty-four cases without visceral\r\nabscesses; and furthermore it shows that in twenty-three of these\r\ncases there was no suppuration, although local inflammations affected\r\nmany of the different tissues, since these patients suffered with\r\narthritis, cellulitis, pleuritis, meningitis, pericarditis, and\r\ncarditis. It is also added that \"the post-mortem appearances, in\r\naddition to the local secondary inflammation before noted, were in\r\nmany cases those changes common to all forms of blood poisoning. Out\r\nof the twenty-four cases, the following are noted: Swollen spleen,\r\nnine times; congestion of the lungs, ten times; swollen liver, six\r\ntimes; cloudy swelling of the kidney, fourteen times.\"[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Trans. London Pathological Soc._, vol. xxx. p. 26.]\r\n\r\nIn this form of pyæmia it has been supposed by some authors that the\r\nmateries morbi occasionally produces death before the metastatic\r\nabscesses have had time to develop, but this is not always the case.\r\nThe same committee report on the above-mentioned twenty-four cases, on\r\nthis point, as follows: \"The duration of the cases before the fatal\r\ntermination was very various. It is tolerably accurately recorded in\r\neighteen cases: of these five died in the first week, five in the\r\nsecond, {971} four in the third, and the remaining four survived to\r\nthe thirtieth, forty-ninth, fifty-second, and sixty-second days.\"[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Trans. London Pathological Soc._, p. 25 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe pathology of pyæmia multiplex having been already fully described,\r\nand since the only essential difference in these morbid conditions\r\nconsists in the complete absence of the metastatic abscesses in cases\r\nof pyæmia simplex, it is therefore thought unnecessary to dwell here\r\nlonger on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe morbid anatomy of septicæmia has been carefully studied of late,\r\nand it is now known that the most characteristic lesions are found in\r\nthe blood and the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nAs a manifestation of the general poisoning of the blood, it might be\r\nexpected that putrefaction would follow rapidly after the death of the\r\npatient. In fact, Davine defines septicæmia as \"putrefaction of a\r\nliving body.\" Observation has now thoroughly confirmed that which was\r\nformerly an anticipation. Panum, Hemmer, and Bergmann have each called\r\nattention to the fact that rapid decomposition follows the death of\r\nall animals in which septicæmia has been produced for experimental\r\npurposes. It has also been observed that putrefaction in the human\r\ncadaver begins much sooner, and progresses much more rapidly, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, when the death has been produced by this\r\ndisease than when it has occurred from any other cause. Furthermore,\r\nthis rapid decomposition is not limited to the internal organs, but\r\nmay be frequently strongly marked on the surface of the body after the\r\nlapse of twelve hours, although it has been kept in a comparatively\r\ndry and cool atmosphere. In those cases where the septicæmia has\r\noriginated in an external wound it has been uniformly observed that\r\nputrefaction goes on most rapidly in the vicinity of the wound after\r\nthe death of the patient.\r\n\r\nIn every case of fatal septicæmia the post-mortem examination will\r\nshow that the coagulability of the blood has been diminished or\r\ndestroyed. In fact, it has been abundantly shown that in all cases of\r\ntrue septicæmia the coagulability of the blood is more or less\r\ndiminished. The few imperfect clots of blood found after death are of\r\na deep-black color. The putrefaction of the soft tissues is greatly\r\nhastened by the presence of this blood; and, consequently, this\r\nprocess goes on most rapidly in the most dependent portions of the\r\nbody, especially along the course of the large veins. The septicæmic\r\nblood possesses a peculiar putrefactive odor, and it is occasionally\r\nfound to be acid in its reaction, according to Vogel and Scherer,\r\nmaking it highly probable that it will end in the formation of the\r\ncarbonate of ammonium. The chemical examinations of septicæmic blood\r\nwhich have heretofore been made have completely failed to give\r\nsatisfactory results in regard either to the existence or nature of\r\nthe materies morbi in this disease, although, without doubt, there has\r\noccasionally been found, principally in the blood of those who have\r\ndied of acute septic intoxication, a poisonous substance, which\r\nBergmann designated sepsin. Microscopic examinations have shown that\r\nin the blood and also in various organs of those who have died of\r\nsepticæmia there are always present, under these circumstances, a\r\nlarge number of the rod bacteria; in fact, they are more numerous than\r\nafter death from any other infectious disease. Furthermore, they are\r\nfound in the blood, lymph-glands, and cellular tissues during the\r\nwhole course of the disease.\r\n\r\n{972} There are no pathological changes in the central nervous system\r\nwhich arise directly from septicæmia, although in some cases, when\r\nthere has been some cardiac complication or very severe dyspnoea from\r\nany cause immediately prior to the death of the patient, there may be\r\nfound hyperæmia of the membranes of the cerebro-spinal axis. The brain\r\nand spinal cord remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe endo- and pericardium occasionally present a somewhat mottled\r\nappearance resembling ecchymosis, which is evidently a deposit from\r\nthe blood, and may be washed off with water. The inner surface of the\r\nventricles presents a similar appearance from the same cause. In\r\naddition to those changes which have been mentioned there are\r\noccasionally found some slight traces of an inflammatory process in\r\nthese parts; but it never extends to the formation of pus or\r\nulceration, which frequently happens in cases of pyæmia. The quantity\r\nof pericardial fluid is sometimes increased in septicæmia, and is\r\ngenerally somewhat thickened, cloudy, and slightly tinged with blood.\r\nThe changes in the pleural surfaces are the same as those which have\r\nbeen noted in the pericardium, but any increase of the fluid within\r\nthe pleural sacs is an exception to the general law, and is very\r\nrarely seen. The lungs are generally found slightly congested, but\r\nthere may be some ecchymosis in exceptional cases. Pus is never found\r\nin the lungs or within the pleural cavities in pure unmixed\r\nsepticæmia. The pathological changes in the liver resemble those in\r\nthe lungs. This organ is commonly found in a state of passive\r\ncongestion, while the color of its tissues is slightly darkened. The\r\ncongestion of the kidneys and spleen in this disease is much more\r\nmarked than that of the lungs and liver. The parenchymatous tissue of\r\nthe kidneys is commonly found in an oedematous condition, and the\r\ntubuli uriniferi are more or less affected by a catarrhal\r\ninflammation, which is manifested by the exfoliation of granular\r\nepithelium. The same catarrhal condition, but in a milder form, is\r\nfound to affect the mucous membrane of the bladder. In females the\r\novaries, uterus, and vagina are in a state of hyperæmia, with more or\r\nless catarrhal inflammation of the latter organ. Septicæmia invariably\r\ncauses pregnant females to abort. There is commonly softening of the\r\nspleen. The alimentary canal is almost constantly affected by acute\r\nintestinal catarrh, with enlargement of the intestinal follicles and\r\nmesenteric glands, while there are frequently hemorrhages from the\r\nserous and mucous membranes. The various muscles of the body and the\r\nextremities are found to be of a dark brownish-red after the death of\r\nthe patient, instead of possessing their natural pale-red color. It\r\nmay now be stated, finally, that the pathological changes in\r\nsepticæmia are less marked than those of pyæmia multiplex.\r\n\r\nThe semiology, etiology, and pathology of septo-pyæmia consist in a\r\nblending, in different degrees, of the essential parts of pyæmia and\r\nsepticæmia; and since the pathology of both these diseases has been\r\npresented separately, it is deemed unnecessary to enter into a\r\nconsideration of this combination.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF PYÆMIA.--Pyæmia very rarely, if ever, develops except in\r\nconnection with an open suppurating wound, and consequently it must\r\ngenerally be regarded as a wound complication or as a secondary\r\ndiseased condition. Those open wounds are unquestionably the most\r\nfavorably situated for the development of this disease which involve\r\nthe medullary {973} cavities of the long bones, owing to the liability\r\nof unhealthy suppuration, the difficulty of complete drainage, and the\r\nfavorable anatomical conditions for absorption.\r\n\r\nEvery form of pyæmia is frequently preceded by a distinctly marked\r\nprodromal stage, which varies in duration from four days to two weeks.\r\nIn fact, the ordinary precursor of this disease, in all those cases in\r\nwhich the bones are involved, is an attack of osteo-myelitis; but in\r\nother cases the patient often complains of malaise, giddiness,\r\nheadache, pain in the limbs, weakness, and loss of appetite, while the\r\nexperienced surgeon will be deeply impressed with the patient's rapid\r\nemaciation and cadaverous face. These symptoms are soon followed by\r\njaundiced skin, etc. The commencement of an attack of pyæmia is\r\ncommonly manifested by a chill. The importance which will naturally be\r\nattached to this phenomenon in connection with an open wound must\r\ndepend to a certain degree on the circumstances attending its\r\noccurrence; and therefore the following question will present itself:\r\nIs the chill associated with suppuration? A negative answer to this\r\nquestion, based on the fact that insufficient time has elapsed since\r\nthe occurrence of the injury to render suppuration possible, can never\r\nfail to be a source of satisfaction to the surgeon, whose experience\r\nhas taught him to dread pyæmia.\r\n\r\nBillroth has observed in 83 cases of true pyæmia multiplex that 62\r\ncommenced with a chill, and 21 without; in 81 cases of septicæmia and\r\nsimple pyæmia 24 commenced with a chill and 57 without. The number of\r\nchills in each individual patient occurred according to the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  Number of patients  19  21  14  15   9   5   2   3   4   1   1   1\r\n  Number of chills     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  13  14\r\n\r\nIn one patient during three weeks sixteen chills were observed, and\r\nprobably the longer the duration of the disease the greater is the\r\nnumber of chills. Still, there are chronic cases with a single chill,\r\nand acute cases with many. It rarely occurs that a patient has more\r\nthan one chill in twenty-four hours. Billroth noticed among his\r\npatients only sixteen who had two chills, and only six who each had\r\nthree chills, in one day. The experience that fewer chills occur\r\nduring the evening and night than in the morning and afternoon has\r\nbeen confirmed by statistics. Among 287 chills, 220 occurred from 8\r\nA.M. to 8 P.M., while during the night, from 8 P.M. to 8 A.M., only 67\r\nwere observed. By this arbitrary division of the twenty-four hours\r\nBillroth desired to take into consideration the daily exacerbation in\r\nconnection with the usual daily irritation of the wound, the\r\nbandaging, and other manipulations. He saw, for example, a chill occur\r\nthree times from the introduction of a sound, and twenty times after\r\nthe opening of an abscess. The time which elapsed from the first\r\ninjury to the first chill is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  First chill began, times              14  19  15   9   4   3   2   4\r\n  Length of time after injury, in weeks  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8\r\n\r\nPatients who had fever before the operation were more inclined to\r\nearly chills than recently-injured healthy individuals. Billroth's\r\nexperience was to have only the first chill before the end of the\r\nfirst week. It may be further stated that nervous, irritable patients\r\nsuffer much more {974} frequently from chills than those of a\r\nphlegmatic temperament. This fact has given rise to the opinion that\r\nthe absorption of pus acts especially on the central nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe chills in pyæmia are supposed by Billroth to be associated with\r\ninflammation, and he says: \"It must be mentioned, as a matter of\r\nobservation, that chills occur almost exclusively in the commencement\r\nof an acute inflammation, and are intermittent only in intermittent\r\nfever and reabsorption of pus, while they do not occur in acute\r\nsepticæmia.\"[40] But the fever in pyæmia rarely intermits entirely; it\r\nis generally lower, however, in the morning than in the afternoon.\r\nThis symptom is even more important than the rigors in enabling the\r\nsurgeon to make a correct diagnosis. Let it, however, be remembered\r\nthat the temperature frequently becomes very high within a few hours\r\nafter the receipt of an injury or the performance of a surgical\r\noperation; that this high temperature may be due to septic absorption,\r\nand that this diseased condition is what we designate as septicæmia.\r\nAnother condition, less marked, with an elevated but somewhat lower\r\ntemperature, is usually spoken of as traumatic fever. In this\r\ncondition the fever may gradually increase for a few days, and then\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Surgical Pathology_, p. 344.]\r\n\r\nOne important peculiarity of the temperature in pyæmia are the sudden\r\nand great changes; thus, at one hour the temperature may be slightly\r\nraised above the normal, and at the next the thermometer may mark 105°\r\nF. These sudden changes of temperature are of frequent occurrence, are\r\nnot observed to the same extent in any other disease, and therefore\r\nsupply a very important diagnostic indication. It is impossible to\r\nknow, or even to anticipate with any degree of certainty, when the\r\nhighest temperature will exist; consequently, Billroth and other\r\nwriters have suggested the desirability of having a thermometer\r\nconstantly kept in a position to indicate every change in the heat of\r\nthe body, and a careful attendant to note the same; but, thus far, I\r\nam not aware that this has been attempted, probably on account of the\r\ninconvenience to the patient and the additional labor in nursing it\r\nwould entail. It has been further observed that during the existence\r\nof a chill the temperature continues to steadily increase, and the\r\nmaximum seen during the whole course of the disease is attained during\r\nthe hot stage which immediately follows the rigors. \"This condition is\r\nfollowed by profuse cold perspirations. The perspirations which\r\naccompany this disease are most profuse, like those of advanced\r\nphthisis. They never precede the rigors, but may occur independently\r\nof them. They are either continuous in their duration, or exhibit more\r\nor less distinct exacerbations. They are occasionally accompanied by\r\nsudamina, and they do not abate with the use of any known remedy....\r\nOccasionally perspiration is scanty; but before death a cold clammy\r\nsweat and a tawny discoloration of the skin occur.\"[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Braidwood, _op. cit._, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nBesides the sudamina there are frequently observed on the skin\r\nvesicles, pustules, and boils, purpuric patches, and various\r\ndiscolorations. There is frequently observed to arise in the\r\nneighborhood of the wound a reddish erythematous blush, which soon\r\nextends to the whole limb, and commonly begins to disappear in the\r\nearly part of the second week. This recently occurred to a patient\r\nunder my care, and was speedily followed by an abscess of the\r\nknee-joint. The wound was situated at the hip-joint, {975} and the\r\nfirst change in the color of the integument took place around its\r\nlips. The redness extended rapidly downward until it covered the foot,\r\nand even the toes; but the extension upward was slight, not much above\r\nthe nates, on which there was situated at the time a bed-sore. It\r\nobserved the same order in passing off as in coming on--_i.e._ where\r\nit first made its appearance it first disappeared. The superficial\r\nveins leading from the wound were inflamed and cord-like. This\r\ncondition of the integument and the abscess of the knee-joint were\r\nfollowed by diarrhoea, on which medicines had no beneficial effect. It\r\ncontinued, with occasional vomiting, until the death of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe pulse in pyæmia may be nearly normal as regards frequency, while\r\nat other times very rapid. It has been remarked in some cases that the\r\npulse seldom rose above 90 per minute until near death. The pulse,\r\nalthough only moderately accelerated at the commencement of the\r\ndisease, always becomes more rapid, quick, feeble, and irregular\r\ntoward the termination of the unfavorable cases, while in cases of\r\nrecovery it returns gradually to the normal standard.\r\n\r\nIn all cases in which the blood has been examined during the progress\r\nof pyæmia the examiners have agreed in regard to its extreme\r\ncoagulability, the diminution of the number of red corpuscles, and the\r\nincrease of the granular spherical bodies. The red corpuscles, even in\r\nthe earlier stages of the disease, show evident indications of\r\ndisintegrating; and these become more and more marked as the disease\r\nprogresses, while there is a steady increase in the number of pus- or\r\npossibly of white blood-corpuscles. Epistaxis occasionally occurs, and\r\nalso venous oozing from the wound.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the tongue in pyæmia may be regarded as an important\r\nsymptom, indicating the state of the alimentary canal--not, however,\r\nduring the prodromal stage, but after the disease has progressed a few\r\ndays. It is then observed that the tongue has become peculiarly\r\nsmooth, dry, and often excessively red. This smoothness is caused by\r\nthe collapse of the papillæ, and the dryness by a diminished\r\nsecretion. The organ now frequently appears as if covered with a thin\r\nlayer of collodion which had been caused to dry on the surface, so as\r\nto present a glazed look. Again, the tongue may be covered with brown\r\ncrusts and the teeth with sordes. These brown crusts and sordes are\r\nusually seen in advanced cases, following the first condition\r\ndescribed. Much importance is attached to these brown crusts by many\r\nexperienced surgeons, and although there may be very marked\r\nimprovement in all other symptoms, still they insist on a very guarded\r\nprognosis until the tongue has assumed a healthy appearance. Aphthæ on\r\nvarious parts of the mouth and pharynx are frequently present in the\r\nmore chronic cases, but are usually absent in acute cases. Herpes of\r\nthe lips sometimes occurs in the commencement of the disease.\r\n\r\nVomiting is comparatively rare, but there is, even in the early\r\nstages, a complete failure of the appetite, with great thirst.\r\nSingultus is rarely present in genuine pyæmia, but frequently so in\r\nsepticæmia, and occasionally in septo-pyæmia. Diarrhoea is not so\r\nfrequent or the stools so copious in pyæmia as in septicæmia. Billroth\r\nobserved in one hundred and eighty cases of pyæmia thirty-two cases of\r\ndiarrhoea. It is impossible to determine whether those cases in which\r\nthe diarrhoea {976} occurred were pure or mixed pyæmia. The stools are\r\noften of a pappy consistence, and passed involuntarily in bed. There\r\nare, however, severe cases of pyæmia with high fever, and accompanied\r\nby obstinate constipation.\r\n\r\nExamination of the heart may, in rare cases, show the existence of\r\npericarditis, although usually the only indications of disease are the\r\ntoo feeble sounds. Auscultation and percussion of the lungs may yield\r\nunsatisfactory results when the metastatic abscesses are small and\r\nscattered, for the same reason as in miliary tuberculosis. The large\r\ndeposits in the lungs are by these means readily determined. There may\r\nbe a sensation of suffocation, the pneumonic sputa, the friction sound\r\nof pleurisy, or the signs of pleuritic effusion; and the existence of\r\nthese symptoms or signs would naturally aid in the diagnosis of\r\nmetastatic abscesses.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the liver and spleen may be determined before death,\r\nand in connection with other symptoms would aid in diagnosing deposits\r\nin these organs.\r\n\r\nThe urine in the first stage of this disease is scanty, high-colored,\r\ncontains a large amount of salts, and is of a high specific gravity.\r\nEpithelial, fibrinous, and blood casts, and also albumen, are\r\noccasionally found in it during the course of the disease. Billroth\r\nmentions a case in which there was complete suppression, with uræmia.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of pyæmia suppuration of the joints, one after another,\r\ntakes place with great rapidity and with comparatively little pain,\r\nbut occasionally some swelling, redness, etc. are present. In most\r\ncases these suppurations are easily diagnosed. Instead of suppuration\r\ntaking place in the joints, there are cases in which it occurs in the\r\ncellular tissue; and I have recently seen a case where abscess after\r\nabscess formed with such rapidity that within a single week the\r\npatient was literally covered with abscesses from the crown of his\r\nhead to the soles of his feet.\r\n\r\nDelirium generally exists during some stage of the disease, more\r\nfrequently the last, and is then mild in its character, although\r\nactive delirium has been observed in the first stage. Patients are\r\nlow-spirited and very apprehensive of death. The face at the beginning\r\nof the attack may be flushed or pallid, but toward the end it always\r\nbecomes careworn and haggard. The breath occasionally has a sweetish\r\nor purulent odor.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the wound are in some cases very marked, even in the\r\nfirst stage of the disease. The suppuration, which has been previously\r\nfree and healthy, may be suddenly checked, the wound becoming dry. The\r\ndischarge, if it continues, becomes scanty, thin, ichorous, or\r\ngreenish. The granulations, if previously healthy, may soon slough.\r\nThese changes may not always appear in the first stage, but should\r\nthey not then take place they may be expected later in the disease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF SEPTICÆMIA.--These are commonly developed within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the receipt of an injury or the performance of\r\na surgical operation, and they may be sketched as follows: Frequent\r\npulse; tongue, lips, and throat dry; skin hot and the temperature of\r\nthe body high. The patient replies accurately to questions, but with\r\nsome hesitation. He is much inclined to sleep, has entirely failed to\r\ntake nourishment, drinks frequently when aroused from his lethargic\r\ncondition, and has vomited everything taken into his stomach since the\r\nreceipt of the injury or the performance of the operation. If {977}\r\nthe dressings are now removed from the wound, the foul odor of\r\nputrefaction greets the attendants. In cases of amputation-wounds\r\nconsiderable discoloration of the flaps may be observed, the edges\r\nbeing blackened. Above these blackened edges the integument is\r\nreddened and slightly oedematous. The wound having been closed with\r\nsutures, which are now removed, there escapes a few drachms--possibly\r\nounces--of highly offensive fluid, the decomposed remains of blood,\r\netc. A further examination of the flaps on their inner surfaces show\r\nthat their capillary circulation has ceased. The tissues, instead of\r\npresenting a life-like appearance, are now of a very dark color and\r\noccasionally mottled with dull grayish spots, although the movements\r\nof the ligature at the point where it embraces the femoral artery, for\r\nexample, show that the blood still rushes against the artificial\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nLet us now leave our patient, without further comment, for the next\r\nforty-eight hours, when we will resume the examination. We now find\r\nthe same dryness of the mouth that was previously noticed; the pulse\r\nis more frequent, and has become very feeble; he complains of much\r\nthirst, has vomited frequently, and has taken very little nourishment,\r\nand that only at the earnest solicitations of the attendants. The\r\ntemperature is higher than at the former examination, and has been\r\nsteadily increasing; in the morning it is lower, however, than in the\r\nevening of the same day. The patient is lethargic, and is suffering\r\nwith a profuse diarrhoea. The odor of the stools is highly offensive;\r\nthey are properly described as rice-water evacuations. The abdomen is\r\ntympanitic; the body bathed in perspiration; the respirations rapid;\r\nthe urine scanty, high-colored, and contains albumen. The examination\r\nof the stump shows that gangrene has extended rapidly, involving not\r\nonly the flap, but a portion of the adjacent tissues. The stench\r\narising from the wound is almost stifling. The decomposing fluids are\r\ncontinually forming. That portion of the thigh not already gangrenous\r\nis now very oedematous, and the integument covering it is much\r\ndiscolored, being of a dark, icteric, or reddened hue.\r\n\r\nWe now allow twenty-four hours to elapse, and then make our final\r\nexamination. The patient's tongue is more moist; the body still bathed\r\nin perspiration; the eyes dull; the conjunctivæ icteric, and the same\r\nhue extends to the body, though in a less marked degree; the pulse has\r\nbecome very frequent, feeble, and not easily counted; the temperature\r\nis below normal. Singultus is now present, and has been so during the\r\nlast twenty-four hours. Bronchial symptoms, combined with marked\r\noedema of the right lung, have appeared; the diarrhoea continues the\r\nsame; the gangrene is still extending.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the report here offered shows only the\r\nsymptoms that are found in a single class of cases. The symptoms vary\r\ngreatly in different cases, but they are especially marked in the\r\nacute sepsis mentioned by Massanneuve under the head of _gangrène\r\nfoudroyante_. In these cases there appears, immediately after the\r\nreceipt of an injury, enormous oedema about the wound, which extends\r\nrapidly in every possible direction, followed by the death of the\r\npatient within a few hours unless prompt measures are adopted. The\r\npuncture of the cellular tissue or of the blood-vessels involved in\r\nthe oedema prior to the death of the patient gives rise to the escape\r\nof a highly offensive gas. Roser mentions a case of this disease in\r\nwhich he promptly amputated {978} the limb of the patient through the\r\nhealthy parts, without even waiting for the administration of an\r\nanæsthetic, and his patient recovered.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of septicæmia must necessarily depend greatly on the\r\ncondition of the patient and the amount of septic material introduced,\r\nbut it is not deemed necessary to dwell longer on this subject.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--It is thought that a brief presentation of the\r\netiological, pathological, and semiological differences may be\r\nadvantageous to busy physicians who desire to obtain, with the least\r\nexpenditure of time, an accurate knowledge of the chief points of\r\ndistinction between these morbid conditions. This effort at\r\ndifferentiation is merely intended to place the most important\r\ncharacteristics in marked contrast; and consequently it should be\r\nremembered that it is not our intention to give here the complete\r\netiology, pathology, or semiology of either of these morbid states,\r\nbut only their essential differences. Furthermore, it is thought that\r\nthe following arrangement will facilitate the object which we desire\r\nto accomplish:\r\n\r\n                               ETIOLOGY.\r\n  PYÆMIA.                          | SEPTICÆMIA.\r\n  1.

The committee of the London\r\nPathological Society reports as follows on this subject: \"The\r\naccumulation of septic matter in the uterus after labor, in contact\r\nwith the raw surface left by the separation of the placenta, would\r\nalso present the conditions favorable to acute septic intoxication. In\r\nthe present day, when the necessity of thorough drainage of wounds is\r\nso thoroughly understood, and the means at the surgeon's command for\r\ncarrying it out are so efficient, it can only be under peculiar\r\ncircumstances that a sufficient quantity of putrid serum or pus to\r\nyield the fatal dose of the septic poison is allowed to accumulate in\r\nthe wound. Moreover, the antiseptic treatment of wounds, now so\r\nlargely adopted, by preventing decomposition of course renders septic\r\nintoxication impossible. Ovariotomy would seem to furnish conditions\r\nmost favorable to septic intoxication, and a large proportion of the\r\ndeaths occurring in the first forty-eight hours {980} have always been\r\nattributed to it. The proportion of fatal cases from this cause has,\r\nhowever, of late been greatly diminished by drainage, and more\r\nespecially by the employment of the antiseptic treatment.\"[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Trans. Path. Soc. of London_, vol. xxx. p. 15.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot repeat too frequently or too emphatically the fact that the\r\ntreatment of pyæmia and septicæmia, when fully developed, is almost\r\ninvariably unsuccessful, and that consequently he who desires to save\r\nthe greatest number of lives must make every exertion and use all\r\navailable means to prevent their development--a task which fortunately\r\nhas now been brought within the scope of possibility in the large\r\nmajority of cases. Every surgeon will readily admit that, were it\r\npossible to secure union by first intention in all cases of wounds,\r\nthen it would be impossible for either septicæmia or pyæmia to occur\r\nin surgical practice. Therefore, it follows that the character of the\r\nwound, the method of operation, the surroundings of the patient, the\r\ncharacter of the treatment, become proper points to consider in this\r\ndivision of the subject. The character of the wound and its relations\r\nto pyæmia and septicæmia have already been briefly referred to under\r\nthe etiology of these diseases. The various methods of operating, with\r\ntheir respective advantages and disadvantages, are of course not\r\nsuitable topics for discussion in this work.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of the patient form a subject of vast importance in a\r\nprophylactic view, and should never be lost sight of in the\r\nconstruction of hospitals. I desire here to express my firm conviction\r\nthat surgical pyæmia is essentially and almost wholly a hospital\r\ndisease. The question of surroundings for the patient presents to my\r\nmind the following demands as a sine quâ non for obtaining the best\r\npossible results in surgery: (1) Absolute cleanliness. This demand\r\nshould be strictly enforced in regard to the wound, the patient's\r\nbody, the bedding, and everything else, including nurses and\r\ninstruments. (2) Absolute purity of the atmosphere. (3) Moderate and\r\nequable temperature, containing a proper amount of moisture. (4)\r\nProper quantity of nutritious and easily digestible food, with\r\nsuitable drinks, etc. (5) Cheerful and pleasant surroundings,\r\nespecially in companions, nurses, and other attendants. It may be\r\nobjected to these conditions that they can never be obtained. I must\r\nconfess that perfection in every detail cannot always be attained, but\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that he who makes a determined effort in\r\nthis direction will succeed far better than that person who is\r\nconstantly looking about for some excuse for negligence.\r\n\r\nThe question of treatment brings up the entire subject of antiseptics.\r\nThe favorite remedies of this class are carbolic and salicylic acids,\r\npermanganate of potassium, chloride of zinc, bichloride of mercury,\r\nand liquor sodæ chlorinatæ. There is no doubt that good results may be\r\nobtained with any of these remedies. The surgeon should never forget\r\nthat he uses medicines merely as agents to enable him to accomplish\r\ncertain objects; and, keeping this in mind, he need very seldom fail\r\nwith his antiseptic when the object is to prevent putrefaction in an\r\nopen wound. Therefore it appears certain that each method of treatment\r\nmay possess special advantages in particular cases, and probably the\r\nsame may be said of the antiseptic itself. The importance of this\r\nsubject may be more fully appreciated when it is remembered that it is\r\ngenerally admitted by the best surgical authorities {981} that more\r\nlives are lost from septic infection than from all other causes\r\ncombined during a war. The further consideration of this subject may\r\nbe arranged for convenience under the heads of local and general\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe local treatment of the wound should, if possible, be of such a\r\ncharacter as to prevent the absorption of either putrid substances or\r\npus. It therefore becomes highly important, in cases of amputation and\r\nother operations, that all tissues injured to such a degree as to be\r\nlikely to excite either putrefaction, irritation, or inflammation\r\nshould be removed. The same care is necessary in removing all foreign\r\nbodies from the wound in cases where no operation is to be performed.\r\nThe amputation of the injured limb may be necessary to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of these diseases, or it may be resorted to in certain\r\nrare cases after the origin of pyæmic symptoms; however, in the latter\r\ninstance great care should be taken to remove all the tissues already\r\ninfiltrated with serum, otherwise nothing will be gained. The use of\r\nthe surgeon's knife at the proper time may be the best prophylactic\r\nagainst both pyæmia and septicæmia, but it should be directed by an\r\nintelligent mind and the instrument guided by a practiced hand. Again,\r\nit is found that opening a large medullary cavity may be attended with\r\ndanger to the patient. This fact teaches us an obvious lesson.\r\n\r\nThe wound existing or the operation having been performed, the surgeon\r\nnow turns his attention to the prevention of putrefaction and\r\ninflammation. The first source of danger requiring attention from the\r\nsurgeon is the fluid escaping from the wounded surface. Do not allow\r\nit to undergo putrefaction in contact with the wound. It should not be\r\nforgotten that pyæmia is an infectious disease, having its origin in a\r\nlocal nidus, an open wound, in which putrefaction of pus or other\r\nwound-fluid is taking place. The question of amputation, or of the\r\nextirpation of the parts for the relief of this disease, should only\r\nbe entertained when the surgeon is confident that he can remove the\r\nwhole of the infiltrated tissues. In other words, the performance of\r\nthese operations after the disease has become constitutional can never\r\nbe advantageous to the patient. Even in those cases where infiltration\r\nis limited to the lymphatics, unless all these glands so affected are\r\nremoved the operation will be unsuccessful. It has been further\r\nrecommended in the treatment of this disease, in order to prevent the\r\nformation of metastatic abscesses, to ligate the veins in which\r\nthrombi have formed or may be reasonably expected to form, at some\r\nconvenient point between the heart and these obstructed points. The\r\nvalue of this proceeding has never been fully determined, and may be\r\nreasonably questioned. The formation of metastatic abscesses in\r\nvarious parts of the body within the reach of the surgeon's scalpel\r\ndemands his attention; and we have been taught by experience that they\r\nshould be speedily opened, which generally lowers the temperature and\r\ndiminishes the danger from septic absorption. In the performance of\r\nthis operation Lister's antiseptic system of wound-treatment should be\r\nstrictly adhered to, since it unquestionably gives the best results\r\nwhich can be obtained under the circumstances. When the metastatic\r\ninflammation which occasionally appears in the thyroid and parotid\r\nglands during the course of this disease terminates in the formation\r\nof pus, this should be speedily evacuated. This prompt action is often\r\nrequired, particularly for the relief of the grave symptoms which are\r\napt {982} to arise in connection with respiration and deglutition. The\r\naccumulation of pus within the joints in pyæmic cases should, it is\r\nnow thought, be treated in the same manner as abscesses in the\r\ncellular tissues--_i.e._ the articulations should be opened and\r\nthoroughly disinfected, and afterward kept in a perfectly aseptic\r\ncondition, and also rendered absolutely immovable during the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nHaving directed attention to the more important local measures, we may\r\nnow briefly enter on the consideration of some of the constitutional\r\nremedies. In the general treatment of pyæmia there have been\r\nrecommended at various times a great variety of drugs, but the general\r\nwant of success attending their use leaves comparatively few to be\r\nmentioned here. The mineral acids are still employed, and are found to\r\nbe at least agreeable drinks, and as such can be still recommended.\r\nThe sulphites of magnesium, sodium, potassium, and lime were\r\nrecommended by Giovanni Polli for the treatment of typhus fever,\r\nscarlet fever, small-pox, septicæmia, and pyæmia. He further suggested\r\nthat the medicine should be given until the whole quantity taken bore\r\nto the weight of the patient's body the proportion of 1 to 1000. The\r\nexperiments made on animals with these salts seem to confirm their\r\nvalue in the treatment of septic diseases. It is certainly true that\r\nanimals treated with these salts are not so easily affected by septic\r\npoison as those which have not received this treatment. Further, it\r\nhas been shown that putrid substances when mixed with either\r\npermanganate of potassium or the sulphite of sodium, and then\r\ninjected, are harmless, although the same quantity of putrid matter\r\ninjected without either of these salts destroys life.\r\n\r\nBrandy and other alcoholic stimulants have been strongly recommended\r\non account of their well-known antiseptic properties. The sulphate of\r\nquinia is certainly, in most cases of pyæmia, a valuable agent. In\r\nlarge doses it enables the surgeon to reduce the temperature of the\r\npatient, and in smaller doses it frequently serves a valuable purpose\r\nas a tonic. It has also considerable value as an antiseptic.\r\n\r\nLattin has recommended the use of large doses of ergotine in\r\ninfectious fevers, but this substance, when employed in the treatment\r\nof pyæmia, should be given in the formative stage of the disease. The\r\nuse of drastic cathartics should be avoided, as should that of\r\nsudorifics, on account of their prostrating effects. In some cases\r\nhypnotics may be required to secure sleep.\r\n\r\nTonics are always more or less useful. The free use of stimulants and\r\nnutritious food is also indicated. Brandy, wine, and whiskey may be\r\nadvantageously used as stimulants. Musk, ammonia, and camphor are\r\noccasionally required. However, it should not be forgotten that in\r\ncases where the disease has become fully developed the usual\r\ntermination is death, few recoveries being recorded. In the early\r\nstages of this affection, by the removal of the patient from an\r\novercrowded hospital ward to some place where pure air and proper\r\nhygienic arrangements can be obtained, recovery may take place, but\r\nunder other circumstances the prognosis is exceedingly grave.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of septicæmia in most particulars is the same as that of\r\npyæmia. The first effort should be to prevent the development of the\r\ndisease, and the second to care for the patient in cases where the\r\naffection has already developed. It is not, of course, in our power to\r\nlimit or in any way {983} regulate the primary injury, for we are\r\nobliged to take the patient as he is. The amount of injury to living\r\ntissue may be great or small. The question of an operation, the\r\ncharacter of the same, and the subsequent management must be\r\ndetermined in accordance with the circumstances of each particular\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe primary death of the parts is generally due chiefly to the injury\r\nitself; the secondary, frequently to bad surgical management. Let us\r\nnow take a case in which the primary injury has been severe, greatly\r\ndiminishing, but not destroying, the circulation in the injured parts.\r\nHere the immediate application of ice would be injurious, but a warm\r\napplication might assist nature. It is humiliating to the profession\r\nthat we are obliged even at this date to admit that the treatment of\r\nsepticæmia is largely symptomatic. The profuse choleraic diarrhoea\r\nwhich generally accompanies this disease may be regarded as an effort\r\nof nature to eliminate the septic poison; but, nevertheless, it is so\r\nprostrating in its effects that it requires to be controlled with\r\nproperly selected astringents, and these remedies may be still further\r\naided by the use of stimulants and tonics.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of septicæmia may be summarized as follows: (1) A strict\r\nadherence to the five rules given under the head of the prophylactic\r\ntreatment of pyæmia. (2) The avoidance of all putrefaction in contact\r\nwith the wound, especially prior to the development of sufficient\r\ngranulations to completely cover its surface. This object is to be\r\naccomplished by the removal of all necrotic tissues, the avoidance of\r\nputrescent fluids by cleanliness, and the proper use of antiseptic\r\nagents. (3) Free use of the alkaline sulphites and hyposulphites.\r\nThese drugs should be used in all cases where there is reason to\r\nanticipate the development of septic diseases, as soon after the\r\nreceipt of the injury as practicable, but should not be neglected even\r\nafter the disease has become fully developed. (4) Sulphate of quinia\r\nshould be used in all cases where the temperature is above 100° F.,\r\nand its persistent use in large doses may be necessary to prevent the\r\nfever from rising still higher. It will be remembered in this\r\nconnection that experience has taught us that \"a temperature of 108.5°\r\nF. is the limit beyond which life can no longer exist,\"[43] and even a\r\nmuch lower temperature is not without dangers. \"The essential danger\r\nof fever in acute diseases consists, then, in the deleterious\r\ninfluence of a high temperature on the tissues.\"[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Liebermeister, _New Sydenham Soc. Trans._, vol. lxvi. p.\r\n278.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Ibid._, p. 280.]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of puerperal septicæmia, although requiring the\r\napplication of the same principles as any other form of this disease,\r\nmay be briefly described as follows: The womb should be maintained in\r\na firmly-contracted state by the proper use of ergot, even as a\r\nprophylactic measure, and also during the whole course of the disease;\r\nthe uterus and vagina should be kept in an aseptic condition by the\r\nefficient use of antiseptics; sulphate of quinia should be given in\r\nlarge doses, and repeated as often as may be necessary in order to\r\nlower the temperature; and morphia or some form of opium should be\r\nemployed for the relief of the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{984}\r\n\r\nPUERPERAL FEVER.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM T. LUSK, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Puerperal fever is an infectious disease, due, as a rule,\r\nto the septic inoculation of the wounds which result from the\r\nseparation of the decidua and the passage of the child through the\r\ngenital canal in the act of parturition.\r\n\r\nTo maintain this definition it is, however, necessary to group by\r\nthemselves cases of childbed fever dependent upon causes which are\r\noperative in the non-puerperal condition, though the latter imparts to\r\nthese causes oftentimes an exceptional activity and virulence. In this\r\ncategory are to be placed especially scarlatina, typhus, typhoid, and\r\nmalarial fevers. It is to be borne in mind that the zymotic fevers may\r\nprovoke in the puerperal woman the same inflammatory lesions commonly\r\nassociated with puerperal fever.[1] This is in accordance with the\r\nwell-known surgical experience that a febrile paroxysm from any cause\r\nexerts an unfavorable influence upon a wounded surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hervieux, _Traité clinique et pratique des maladies\r\npuerperales_, pp. 1073 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nLike all brief statements, the writer is well aware that the foregoing\r\ndefinition is necessarily imperfect, and stands in need of further\r\nlimitations to meet the requirements of exactness. Exceptions,\r\nhowever, either apparent or real, will be noted hereafter in their\r\nproper connections.\r\n\r\nFREQUENCY.--In a careful search through the records preserved by the\r\nHealth Department of New York City, I found that from 1868 to 1875\r\ninclusive the total number of deaths for nine years was 248,533. Of\r\nthese, 3342 were from diseases complicating pregnancy, from the\r\naccidents of child-bearing, or from diseases of the puerperal state;\r\nor, in other words, 1:75 of all the deaths occurring during that\r\nperiod was the result of the performance of what we are in the habit\r\nof regarding as a physiological function.\r\n\r\nThe deaths from miscarriage, from shock, from prolonged labor, from\r\ninstrumental delivery, from convulsions, from hemorrhage, from rupture\r\nof the uterus, and from extra-uterine pregnancy, and deaths from\r\neruptive fevers, from phthisis, and from inflammatory non-puerperal\r\naffections complicating childbirth, made a total of 1395, or about 42\r\nper cent. of the entire number. The remaining 1947 cases, variously\r\nreported as puerperal fever, puerperal peritonitis, metro-peritonitis,\r\nphlebitis, phlegmasia dolens, pyæmia, and septicæmia, represent the\r\nvery serious sacrifice of life resulting from inflammatory processes\r\nwhich have their starting-point in the generative apparatus. If we\r\napply the general term, puerperal fever, to this class of cases, it\r\nwill be seen that the malady is the cause of nearly one {985}\r\none-hundred-and-twenty-seventh of all the deaths occurring in the\r\ncity. The actual number of births for the nine years in question was\r\nroughly estimated at 284,000[2]--an estimate erring upon the side of\r\nliberality. The total number of deaths to the entire number of\r\nconfinements was, then, at least in the proportion of 1:85, or, from\r\npuerperal fever alone, in the proportion of 1:146. Garrigues[3]\r\nexamined the records of the various city institutions during the\r\nperiod in question, and from them estimated the number of births which\r\ntook place in hospitals at 10,572. The recorded deaths were 420.\r\nDeducting these from the totals given above, the general death-rate in\r\ncivil practice from puerperal causes in New York City was in the\r\nproportion of 1:94. Max Boehr[4] in his now-famous statistics reckons\r\nthat one-thirtieth of all married women in Prussia die in childbed.\r\nThe Puerperal Fever Commission[5] appointed by the Berlin Society of\r\nObstetrics and Gynæcology arrived at the conclusion that from 10-15\r\nper cent. of the deaths occurring in women during the period of sexual\r\nactivity were due to childbed fever, and that this disease destroyed\r\nnearly as many lives as small-pox or cholera. But puerperal fever\r\ndiffers from either small-pox or cholera in that the latter presses\r\nlargely upon the aged and the very young, while the former gathers its\r\nvictims exclusively from a selected class--viz. from women in adult\r\nlife, the mothers of families, whose loss, as a rule, is a public as\r\nwell as a private calamity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This estimate was based upon the assumption that the\r\nnatural birth-rate is 33 to the 1000--a proportion believed by the\r\nstatisticians of the Board of Health to be approximatively correct,\r\nthough probably somewhat in excess of the reality. P. Osterloh has\r\nrecently stated that my statistics were computed in so arbitrary a\r\nmanner as to render deductions from them valueless. In this, however,\r\nhe is mistaken. The most conscientious care was taken in their\r\npreparation; wherever the possibility of error existed the fact was\r\ndistinctly indicated, and all calculations were made in such a way\r\nthat whatever corrections might be required would strengthen the\r\nconclusions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"On Lying-in Institutions,\" _Trans. Am. Gyn. Soc._, vol.\r\nii., 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"Untersuchungen über die Haüfigkeit des Todes im\r\nWochenbett in Preussen,\" _Zeitschr. f. Geburtsk. und Gynaek._, vol.\r\niii. p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Zeitschr. f. Geburtsk. und Gynaek._, vol. iii. p. 1.]\r\n\r\nFor those who regard statistics with habitual distrust it may perhaps\r\nbe well to state that the foregoing frightful picture is no\r\nexaggeration, but is less sombre than the actual truth.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to consider the nature of puerperal fever it is\r\ndesirable to first recall the anatomical lesions with which it is\r\nassociated. These, it will be found, are for the most part\r\ninflammatory processes having their starting-point in injuries of the\r\ngenital passage produced by parturition, complicated in many cases by\r\nseptic changes in the blood, by secondary degeneration of\r\nparenchymatous organs, and at times by phlegmonous and erysipelatous\r\naffections in remote as well as in the adjacent serous and cutaneous\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The primary lesions connected with puerperal fever\r\nare so various that the student will find it convenient to classify\r\nthem according as they are situated in the mucous membrane of the\r\nutero-vaginal canal, the parenchyma of the uterus, the pelvic cellular\r\ntissue, the peritoneum, the lymphatics, or the veins. Not, indeed,\r\nthat such an arrangement is strictly in accordance with clinical\r\nexperience--as a rule, the inflammatory processes are rarely limited\r\nto a single tissue--but because the prognosis and treatment {986} are\r\ndetermined in great measure by the tissue-system which is\r\npredominantly affected. The significance of puerperal inflammations,\r\nwherever seated, likewise depends upon whether they are local and\r\ncircumscribed or whether they present a spreading character.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have found the following classification of\r\nSpiegelberg[6] of great utility as a means of keeping in mind the\r\nprincipal points to which inquiry should be directed in estimating the\r\nsignificance of the febrile conditions of childbed:\r\n\r\n1. Inflammation of the Genital Mucous Membrane.--Endocolpitis and\r\nendometritis.\r\n\r\n_a_. Superficial.\r\n\r\n_b_. Ulcerative (diphtheritic).\r\n\r\n2. Inflammation of the Uterine Parenchyma, and of the Subserous and\r\nPelvic Cellular Tissue.\r\n\r\n_a_. Exudation circumscribed.\r\n\r\n_b_. Phlegmonous, diffused; with lymphangitis and pyæmia (lymphatic\r\nform of peritonitis).\r\n\r\n3. Inflammation of the Peritoneum covering the Uterus and its\r\nAppendages.--Pelvic peritonitis and diffused peritonitis.\r\n\r\n4. Phlebitis Uterina and Para-uterina, with formation of thrombi,\r\nembolism, and pyæmia.\r\n\r\n5. Pure Septicæmia.--Putrid absorption.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"Ueber das Wesen des Puerperalfiebers,\" _Volkmann's\r\nSamml. klin. Vortr._, No. 3.]\r\n\r\nENDOCOLPITIS AND ENDOMETRITIS.--In the superficial, catarrhal form of\r\ninflammation the mucous membrane of the vagina is swollen and\r\nhyperæmic, the papillæ are enlarged, and the discharge is profuse; in\r\nthe vaginal portion of the cervix the labia uterina are oedematous and\r\ncovered with granulations which bleed at the slightest touch; in the\r\ncavity of the body there are increased transudation of serum and\r\nabundant pus-formation. The deep structures of the uterus are usually\r\nnot affected. Sometimes the inflammation extends to the\r\ntubes--_salpingitis_--or, passing outward through the fimbriated\r\nextremities, it may spread over the adjacent peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThe small wounds at the vaginal orifice are at times converted into\r\nulcers with tumefied borders. These so-called puerperal ulcers are\r\ncovered with a greenish-yellow layer. They are associated usually with\r\noedematous swelling of the labia. Under favorable sanitary conditions\r\nthe deposit, which consists in the main of pus-cells, clears away and\r\nthe surface heals by granulation. The ulcerative form of inflammation\r\nis very rare outside of crowded hospitals.\r\n\r\nDiphtheritic ulcers are situated with greatest frequency in the\r\nneighborhood of the posterior commissure or around the vaginal\r\norifice. In rarer instances they are found upon the anterior wall and\r\nin the fornix of the vagina, in the cervix, and upon the site of the\r\nplacenta. The borders are red and jagged; the base is covered with a\r\nyellowish-gray, shreddy membrane; the secretion is purulent, alkaline,\r\nand fetid; and the adjacent tissues are oedematous. From the vulva\r\nthey may extend to the perineum or pursue a serpiginous course down\r\nthe thighs. In the uterus and about the cervix they vary as regards\r\nsize, and are either of a rounded shape or form narrow bands. The\r\nintervening portions of tissue which have not undergone destructive\r\nchanges swell and stand out in strong {987} relief. Where the entire\r\ninner surface has become necrosed, it is often covered with a smeary,\r\nchocolate-brown mass which, when washed away with a stream of water,\r\nleaves exposed either the deepest layer of the mucous membrane or the\r\nunderlying muscular structures.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the superficial ulcerations of the genital\r\ncanal and the diphtheritic form involving destruction of the deeper\r\ntissues is due to the presence in the latter of minute organisms\r\ntermed micrococci, the relations of which to puerperal infection will\r\nbe considered in a subsequent division.\r\n\r\nMETRITIS AND PARAMETRITIS.--In ulcerative endometritis, and even in\r\nthe extreme catarrhal form, the parenchyma of the uterus likewise\r\nbecomes involved. The changes which are designated under the term\r\nmetritis consist in the first place of oedematous infiltration of the\r\ntissues. As a consequence, the organ contracts imperfectly and becomes\r\nsoft and flabby, so that sometimes, upon post-mortem examination, it\r\nbears the imprint of the intestines.\r\n\r\nIn diphtheritic endometritis the gangrenous process may attack the\r\nmuscular tissue, and give rise to losses of muscular substance--a\r\ncondition known as necrotic endometritis or putrescence of the uterus.\r\n\r\nInflammatory changes are rarely lacking in the intermuscular\r\nconnective tissue, which exhibits in places serous or gelatinous\r\ninfiltration, with afterward pus formation, and with here and there\r\nsmall abscesses. The sero-purulent infiltration of the connective\r\ntissue is specially marked beneath the peritoneal covering of the\r\nuterus either behind or along the sides at the attachment of the broad\r\nligaments. In the same situations the lymphatics, which normally are\r\nbarely perceptible to the naked eye, are sometimes enlarged to the\r\nsize of a quill, and are characterized by varicose dilatations\r\noccurring singly or presenting a beaded arrangement. In the substance\r\nof the uterus the dilated vessels are liable to be mistaken for small\r\nabscesses. The pus-like substance contained in the lymphatics is\r\ncomposed of pus-cells and of micrococci. From the cellular tissue\r\nsurrounding the vagina, or that beneath the peritoneal covering of the\r\nuterus, the inflammation may spread by contiguity of tissue between\r\nthe folds of the broad ligament, and thence pass upward to the iliac\r\nfossæ. Usually the process is unilateral. After the inflammation has\r\ncrossed the linea terminalis it may take a forward direction above the\r\nsheath of the ilio-psoas muscle to Poupart's ligament, or it may creep\r\nupward, following the course, according to the side affected, of the\r\nascending or descending colon, to the region of the kidney. It is rare\r\nfor inflammation of the cellular tissue to travel around the bladder\r\nto the front. In such cases it pursues its course between the walls of\r\nthe bladder and the uterus, and along the round ligament to the\r\ninguinal canal. In a few cases the cellulitis mounts above Poupart's\r\nligament, between the peritoneum and the abdominal wall.\r\n\r\nThe course of the inflammation is not simply fortuitous, but follows\r\nprearranged pathways in the connective tissue. König[7] and\r\nSchlesinger[8] have shown that when air, water, or liquefied glue is\r\nforced into the cellular tissue between the broad ligaments the\r\ninjected mass has a tendency to invade the iliac fossæ. In\r\nSchlesinger's experiments, if the canula of the syringe was inserted\r\ninto the anterior layer of the broad ligament, {988} the glue spread\r\nbetween the folds to the abdominal end of the Fallopian tube; thence,\r\nfollowing the track of the vessels, it passed to the linea terminalis;\r\nand finally mounted upward along the colon or swept forward to\r\nPoupart's ligament until the advance was stopped at the outer border\r\nof the round ligament. If the injection was made to the side of the\r\ncervix through the posterior layer at the junction of the cervix and\r\nthe body, the posterior layer gradually bulged out, the peritoneum was\r\nlifted from the side wall of the pelvis, and the glue passed beyond\r\nthe vessels to reach the iliac fossa. If the injection was made to the\r\nside of the cervix through the anterior layer, the glue passed between\r\nthe bladder and the uterus, and forward along the round ligament to\r\nthe inguinal canal, while another portion of the fluid passed between\r\nthe layers of the broad ligament, and reached the peritoneal covering\r\nof the side walls behind the round ligament. If the injection was made\r\nin the median line in a peritoneal fold of Douglas's cul-de-sac, the\r\nfluid travelled forward upon one side along the round ligament and\r\nthence to the posterior wall of the bladder.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Arch. der Heilkunde_, 3 Jahrg., 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Gynaekologische Studien_, No. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe term parametritis, introduced into use by Virchow, is, properly\r\nspeaking, limited to inflammation of the connective tissue immediately\r\nadjacent to the uterus, the older one of pelvic cellulitis furnishing\r\na more comprehensive designation for cases where, as a consequence of\r\na progressive advance from the point of departure in the genital\r\ncanal, the remoter regions have likewise been invaded.\r\nConnective-tissue inflammation presents, as the first essential\r\ncharacteristic, an acute oedema, the fluid which fills the gaps and\r\ninterspaces consisting of transuded serum rendered opaque by the\r\npresence of pus-cells or possessing a gelatinous character. In the\r\nmild, uncomplicated cases the oedema disappears rapidly. Where the\r\ncell-collections are of moderate extent the entire process may vanish\r\nwithout leaving a trace of its existence. If the cell-elements, on the\r\nother hand, are present in great abundance, they, as a rule, first\r\nundergo fatty degeneration, and, after the absorption of the fluid\r\nportion, form a hard tumor composed of a fine granular detritus, which\r\nunder favorable circumstances likewise after a few weeks becomes\r\nabsorbed. In rare cases abscess-formation in the tumor results.\r\n\r\nIn the cellulitis resulting from septic infection, especially in cases\r\ncomplicated by diphtheritis, the tissues seem as if soaked with dirty\r\nserum, and contain scattered yellowish deposits, which soon present,\r\neven to the naked eye, the appearance of pus-collections. This\r\nsero-purulent oedema is always associated with lymphangitis, the\r\nlymphatic vessels possessing varicose dilatations and beaded\r\narrangements similar to those already described in the uterine tissue.\r\nThe foregoing changes are most distinct in the firm connective tissue\r\nadjacent to the uterus and at the hilum of the ovary, while they are\r\nless clearly traced in the looser structure of the broad ligament\r\n(Spiegelberg).\r\n\r\nIn favorable cases the inflammation is circumscribed, or at least is\r\nlimited, by the nearest lymphatic glands. In cases of intense\r\ninfection it spreads rapidly, and justifies the title bestowed upon it\r\nby Virchow of parametritic malignant erysipelas.\r\n\r\nPELVIC AND DIFFUSED PERITONITIS.--Inflammation of the pelvic\r\nperitoneum may result from severe attacks of catarrhal endometritis,\r\nthe inflammatory process either traversing the uterine tissue or\r\npassing {989} through the Fallopian tubes to the adjacent serous\r\nmembrane; or it may proceed, secondarily, from the stretching and\r\nirritation occasioned by an associated parametritis.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, pelvic peritonitis is not attended with much exudation. The\r\nlatter is situated upon the folds of the peritoneum limiting the\r\ncul-de-sac of Douglas, upon the ovaries, and upon the broad ligaments.\r\nIn favorable cases it consists of fibrinous flakes and fluid pus. If\r\nthe latter is abundant, it may become encysted by the formation of\r\nadhesions between the pelvic organs.\r\n\r\nGeneral peritonitis may result from the extension of a pelvic\r\nperitonitis, or from the transport of poison through the lymphatics\r\ninto the peritoneal sac. In the first case the entire peritoneum is\r\ninjected, and the contents of the abdominal cavity are loosely bound\r\ntogether by pseudo-membranes, composed of pus and coagulated fibrine.\r\nThe intestines are at the same time distended and the diaphragm is\r\npushed upward. In the so-called peritonitis lymphatica the\r\ninflammatory symptoms are at the outset lacking. The abdominal cavity\r\nis found filled with a thin, stinking, greenish or brownish fluid\r\ncomposed of serum and micrococci. The intestines are lax and\r\noedematous, and the muscular structures are paralyzed, with resulting\r\ntympanitic distension. The peritoneal covering of the intestines is\r\ndevoid of lustre, and covered with injected patches, or is stained of\r\na dark-brown color. Death often ensues before the occurrence of\r\nexudation.\r\n\r\nSeptic forms of pelvic inflammation are often associated with\r\noöphoritis, the dilated lymphatics either extending to the substance\r\nof the ovaries, where they may lead to the production of small\r\nabscesses, or, as a result of blood-dissolution, the organs become\r\nsoft, pulpy, and infiltrated with discolored serum, and present\r\nhemorrhagic spots distributed over the surface.\r\n\r\nPHLEBITIS AND PHLEBO-THROMBOSIS.--The formation of thrombi in the\r\nuterine and pelvic veins is sufficiently common during the puerperal\r\nperiod. The coagulation may result from compression or from\r\nenfeeblement of the circulation. A predisposition to its occurrence is\r\ncreated by relaxation of the uterine tissue. A normal thrombus is in\r\nitself harmless. In time it becomes organized, and the occluded vessel\r\nis converted into a connective-tissue cord, or a channel may form\r\nthrough it which permits the passage of the blood-stream. When,\r\nhowever, pus or septic matters obtain access to a thrombus, it\r\nundergoes rapid disintegration, and the particles get swept away into\r\nthe circulation until arrested in the ramifications of the pulmonary\r\nartery. Wherever these poisoned emboli happen to lodge inflammation is\r\nset up in the adjacent tissues, and abscesses result (pyæmia\r\nmultiplex). Sometimes countless collections of pus may form in the\r\nlungs. Less commonly abscesses are found in the liver or spleen,\r\noriginating either from emboli which have already made the pulmonary\r\ncircuit or from thrombi in the pulmonary veins.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the veins (phlebitis) sometimes occurs when the\r\nvessels have to traverse tissues in or near the uterus infiltrated\r\nwith purulent or septic materials. The endothelium then undergoes\r\nproliferation, and thrombosis is produced. Phlebitic thrombi do not\r\nnecessarily break down, and may in that case act as a barrier to the\r\nprogression of septic germs into the circulation (Spiegelberg). As a\r\nrule, however, {990} under the influence of inflammation and\r\ninfection, they become converted into puriform masses.\r\n\r\nThe thrombi grow by accretion in the direction of the heart. They may\r\nextend from the uterus through the internal spermatic, or through the\r\nhypogastric and common iliac veins, to the vena cava. Sometimes the\r\nthrombus may be traced back to the placental site.\r\n\r\nSEPTICÆMIA.--From these local conditions, sooner or later, secondary\r\naffections develop in distant organs. The general affection is, in\r\ngreat part at least, likewise of local origin. Sometimes, however,\r\nwhere the poison, which enters the system through the lymphatics and\r\nveins, is very active and abundant, death may follow from acute\r\nsepticæmia before the changes in the sexual organs have had time to\r\ndevelop. The fatal result in these cases is probably due to paralysis\r\nof the heart. After death post-mortem decomposition rapidly sets in,\r\nthe blood is sticky, and swelling is found in the various\r\nparenchymatous organs.\r\n\r\nThe secondary affections consist in the metastatic abscesses already\r\nnoticed as produced by infected emboli, in circumscribed purulent\r\ncollections due to the conveyance of septic materials into the\r\nblood-current through the lymphatics, in ulcerative endocarditis, in\r\ninflammations of the pleura, the pericardium, and the meninges, and in\r\npurulent inflammation of the joints.\r\n\r\nA study of the nature of puerperal fever will best show how intimately\r\nthese seemingly distinct processes are linked together.\r\n\r\nEARLIER VIEWS CONCERNING THE NATURE OF PUERPERAL FEVER.[9]--According\r\nto the teachings of Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna, of Ambrose Paré,\r\nof Sydenham, and of Smellie, the fevers of puerperal women were\r\nattributable to the suppression of the lochia. For twenty centuries\r\nthis doctrine was accepted almost without dispute, the best clinical\r\nobservers confounding a symptom which is often lacking with the cause\r\nof the disease itself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For data given, and for a great variety of historical\r\ninformation, vide Hervieux, _Traité clinique et pratique des maladies\r\npuerperales_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1686, Puzos[10] taught that milk, circulating in the blood, is\r\nattracted to the uterus during pregnancy and to the breasts after\r\nconfinement, but that milk metastases may form in other parts, and\r\nproduce the symptoms of malignant or intermittent fever. In 1746, A.\r\nde Jussieu, Col de Villars, and Fontaine advanced in support of this\r\ntheory the fact that they had found, on opening the abdomen in women\r\nwho had died from an epidemic which raged that year in Paris, a free\r\nlactescent fluid in the lower portion of the abdominal cavity and\r\nclotted milk adherent to the intestines. This doctrine, which seemed\r\nto be based upon, and to accord with, observation, found many\r\nadherents in France. It lost ground, however, when, in 1801, Bichat\r\npointed out the true nature of the abdominal effusions of women who\r\nhad died in childbed, and demonstrated that they were to be found\r\nlikewise in peritoneal inflammations occurring in men and in\r\nnon-puerperal women.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Premier Mémoire sur les Dépôts lacteux_.]\r\n\r\nWhile, during the second half of the eighteenth century, the doctrine\r\nof milk metastasis held full sway in France, in England and Germany\r\nthe dominant leaders in medicine referred the causes of puerperal\r\nfevers to inflammations of the womb and of the peritoneum. With the\r\nadvances made in pathological anatomy in the beginning of the present\r\n{991} century, France taking the lead, stress was likewise laid upon\r\ninflammations of the veins and of the lymphatics. The vitality of the\r\ndoctrine of local inflammations is well shown by the records kept by\r\nthe Health Board of this city, where a large proportion of the deaths\r\nreturned from childbed fever are entered under the head of metritis,\r\nof peritonitis, of metro-peritonitis, and of puerperal phlebitis.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the doctrines of the so-called localists, the theory\r\nthat puerperal fever is an essential fever, and as much a distinct\r\ndisease as typhus fever, typhoid fever, or relapsing fever, has been\r\nstrenuously advocated by some of the most distinguished clinical\r\nteachers who have devoted their attention to obstetrical science.\r\n\r\nFordyce Barker, the most recent exponent of the essentiality of\r\npuerperal fever, in his classical work upon the _Puerperal Diseases_,\r\nstates the arguments against the local origin of the diseases as\r\nfollows: 1st, that puerperal fever has no characteristic lesions; 2d,\r\nthat the lesions which do exist are often not sufficient to influence\r\nthe progress of the disease or to explain the cause of death; 3d, that\r\nthere may be inflammation, even to an intense degree, of any of the\r\norgans in which the principal lesions of puerperal fever are found,\r\nand yet the disease will lack some of the essential characteristics of\r\npuerperal fever; 4th, that the lesions are essentially different from\r\nspontaneous or idiopathic inflammations of the tissues where these\r\nlesions are found; 5th, that puerperal fever is often communicable\r\nfrom one patient to another through the medium of a third party, and\r\nthat this is not the fact in regard to simple inflammations in\r\npuerperal women.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither Barker, nor those who entertain views similar to his,\r\nquestion the local origin of many febrile affections in childbed, but\r\nclaim that purely local inflammations have each their characteristic\r\nsymptoms, which differ from those of true puerperal fever, that\r\npuerperal fever is a zymotic disease of unknown origin, and that local\r\nlesions, where they coexist, are not the primary source of trouble,\r\nbut are secondary to changes in the blood.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, James Y. Simpson[11] published a short paper \"On the Analogy\r\nbetween Puerperal and Surgical Fever.\" This article may well be\r\nregarded as the foundation of the modern doctrine concerning puerperal\r\nfever, and is well worthy of perusal at the present day; for, though\r\nin the then existing state of pathology many of the links were wanting\r\nwhich have since raised the argument to nearly a mathematical\r\ndemonstration, the paper furnishes a brilliant example of the\r\nscientific foresight which is able to discern the truth even where the\r\nevidence lacks completeness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Edinburgh Medical Journal_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Semmelweis, who was at that time clinical assistant to the\r\nLying-in Hospital at Vienna, made the startling assertion that\r\n\"puerperal patients were chiefly attacked with puerperal fever when\r\nthey had been examined by the physicians who were fresh from contact\r\nwith the poisons engendered by cadaveric decay; that fever ensued in\r\nthe practice of those who after post-mortem examination washed their\r\nhands in the usual manner, whereas no fever or but few cases of\r\ndisease followed when the examiner had previously washed his hands in\r\na solution of chloride of lime.\" In the face of insult, ridicule, and\r\nabuse Semmelweis {992} maintained this position for years, almost\r\nunaided, with fanatical persistency. It was easy for his opponents,\r\nfor the most part managers of the great lying-in asylums, to show from\r\nclinical experiences the weakness of so one-sided a theory. But the\r\nemployment of the equivocal demonstration _falsus in uno, falsus in\r\nomnibus_, served only as a temporary defence against the laxity which\r\nprevailed in hospital management only a quarter of a century ago.\r\nThough Semmelweis died with no other reward than the scorn of his\r\ncontemporaries, it is impossible at the present day to so much as\r\ncontemplate the abuses he attacked without a shudder.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Semmelweis published the result of his ripened experience in\r\na treatise entitled _Die Aetiologie der Begriff und die Prophylaxis\r\ndes Kindbett fiebers_, in which, abandoning his earlier exclusive\r\nposition, he maintained that puerperal fever arises from the\r\nabsorption of putrid animal substances, which produce first\r\nalterations in the blood, and secondly exudations. He distinguished\r\nbetween cases in which the infection was introduced from some external\r\nsource, and which he believed to be the most frequent variety, and\r\nthose where the poison was generated in the system. The sources from\r\nwhich the infection is derived he believed to be--1st, from the dead\r\nbody, regardless of age, sex, or disease, no matter whether the latter\r\nis of puerperal or non-puerperal origin, the virulence depending upon\r\nthe stage of decomposition; 2d, diseased persons, whose malady is\r\nassociated with decomposition of animal tissue, no matter whether the\r\naffected person suffers from childbed fever or not, the decomposing\r\nmatter alone furnishing the product from which infection is derived;\r\n3d, physiological animal substances in the process of decomposition.\r\nAs carriers of infection he regarded the fingers and hands of the\r\nphysician, midwife, or nurse, sponges, instruments, soiled clothing,\r\nthe atmosphere, and, in brief, anything which, after being defiled\r\nwith decomposing animal matter, was brought into contact with the\r\ngenitals of a woman during or subsequent to parturition. Absorption\r\ntakes place from the inner surface of the uterus or from traumata in\r\nthe genital canal. Infection seldom occurs in pregnancy, because of\r\nthe closure of the os internum, the absence of wounded surfaces, and\r\nbecause of the rarity with which examinations are made; during\r\ndilatation infection is common, but exceptional during the period of\r\nexpulsion, because the inner uterine surface is at that time rendered\r\ninaccessible by the advance of the child; in the placental and\r\npuerperal period infection occurs from utensils and instruments, but\r\nchiefly through the access of atmospheric air when the latter is\r\nloaded with decomposing organic matter. In rare instances\r\nauto-infection may result from spontaneous decomposition of the\r\nlochia, of bits of decidua, of coagula of blood, of necrosed tissue,\r\nor in consequence of severe instrumental labors. In a word, puerperal\r\nfever was according to Semmelweis no new specific disease, but a\r\nvariety of pyæmia.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in giving prominence to the labors of\r\nSemmelweis partly from justice to a man who was hated and despised in\r\nhis lifetime, and partly because I believe that few outside of Germany\r\nare really cognizant of the immense service he rendered to humanity,\r\nor that to him is really due a large part of what is now current\r\ndoctrine concerning the nature and prophylaxis of puerperal fever.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF PUERPERAL FEVER AS REGARDED FROM THE {993} STANDPOINT OF\r\nMODERN INVESTIGATION.--The older beliefs in the suppression of the\r\nlochia and the metastases of milk have long since been relegated to\r\nthe domain of old nurses' lore, and do not call for serious\r\ndiscussion. The localist theory, that puerperal fever is a metritis, a\r\nperitonitis, a phlebitis, or an inflammation of the lymphatics, is, as\r\nmortuary records show, still adhered to by many practitioners, and, as\r\nwe have seen, is justified by the fact that puerperal fever is, with\r\nrare exceptions, associated at some period of its progress with\r\ncertain inflammatory processes which have their starting-point in the\r\ngenerative apparatus. But the localist theory leaves out of view the\r\nexistence of blood-poisoning, and yet the coexistence of a\r\nblood-poison with the local lesions is an essential feature of\r\npuerperal fever. It was this defect which gave to the advocates of the\r\nspecificity of puerperal fever their real importance. The outcome of\r\nmodern investigation tends, however, to prove that the puerperal\r\npoison is of a septic nature, and that the usual points of\r\nintroduction of the poison are the lesions of the parturient canal.\r\nThis does not, indeed, exclude other points of entry, for clinical\r\nexperience renders it probable that, under certain conditions, the\r\npoison may be primarily introduced into the blood through the\r\nrespiratory and digestive organs. Puerperal fever is really a surgical\r\nfever, modified, however, by the peculiar physiological conditions\r\nwhich belong to the puerperal state. The argument against its septic\r\norigin is based chiefly upon mistaken ideas concerning the nature of\r\nsepticæmia. So long as the symptoms of the latter were derived for the\r\nmost part from the effects observed as a consequence of injecting\r\nputrid materials into the veins of dogs, a confusion arose from the\r\nfact that the results obtained were commonly those of putrid\r\nintoxication, and not those of true septicæmia. Under such\r\ncircumstances it was not difficult to formulate definitions of\r\nsepticæmia which could be shown to be at variance with the phenomena\r\nwhich ordinarily exist in puerperal fever.\r\n\r\nThe argument that the infectious diseases of childbed are of a septic\r\nnature can best be understood by presenting the proofs in their\r\norderly sequence.\r\n\r\n1st. _It is demonstrable that septic poisons are capable of producing\r\nthe lesions ordinarily associated with puerperal fever._ Thus, it is a\r\nmatter of ordinary experience that the retention of a small bit of the\r\nmembranes within the uterus will produce fetid lochia, and, as the\r\nresult of infection, a febrile condition, which, as a rule, subsides\r\nwith the expulsion of the offending body and the use of disinfectant\r\nwashes. A virulent form of fever is not unfrequently occasioned by\r\nretained coagula or placental débris which have undergone\r\ndecomposition. I was once sent for to see a puerperal patient\r\nsuffering from fever on the fourth day following her confinement. On\r\nentering the room I found the stench intolerable; turning down the\r\nsheets, I discovered that the patient was lying in a decomposing mass,\r\nand learned that her doctor had forbidden, after the birth of her\r\nchild, the removal of the soiled linen and blankets. The patient died\r\nin the third week from pyæmia multiplex.\r\n\r\nHaussmann[12] reported a case of auto-infection in the rabbit which\r\nterminated fatally. A portion of the membrane, retained in the left\r\ncornu, {994} led to diphtheritic losses of substance in the lower\r\nportion of the vagina, to hemorrhagic enteritis, and to peritonitis.\r\nThe same author produced death from septicæmia by injecting into the\r\ngravid uterus of one rabbit serum from the abdomen of another which\r\nhad died from infection. The post-mortem examination showed the\r\nmuscles filled with granules and the peritoneum injected, but no\r\nfibrino-purulent exudation. Injections into the uterus of pus from the\r\nabdomen of a woman who had died from infectious puerperal disease\r\nproduced no effect upon rabbits two weeks gravid, while in the second\r\nhalf of pregnancy premature delivery and death occurred, in one case\r\nin one and a half, in another in two and a half, days. In the animal\r\nwhich died in thirty-six hours there was commencing perimetritis and\r\nperitonitis, while in the one that died after the lapse of sixty hours\r\nthe abdomen was found to contain fibrine and pus.[13] D'Espine\r\ninjected into the uterus of a rabbit which had just produced her young\r\npus from the abdomen of a woman who had died from puerperal disease\r\ntwo days before. This was subsequently followed by other injections of\r\nfetid fluids during the four days following. On the twelfth day the\r\nanimal died. The autopsy revealed peritonitis, most marked in the\r\npelvic cavity, inflammatory alterations in the vagina, uterus, and\r\ntubes, small abscesses in the body of the uterus, softened clots in\r\nthe veins of the broad ligaments, and infarctions of the liver.[14]\r\nSchüller found that subcutaneous injections of septic material in\r\nfemale animals during pregnancy produced a diphtheritic ulcerative\r\nprocess on the uterine surface, which determined the separation of the\r\nplacenta; diphtheritic patches, likewise, were found in the cornua of\r\nthe uterus.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Entstehung der übertragbaren Krankheiten des\r\nWochenbettes,\" _Beitr. zur Geburtsk. und Gynaek._, Bd. iii. Heft 3, p.\r\n345.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Contribution à l'étude de la septicémie puerpérale_,\r\nParis, 1873, p. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Ibid._, p. 394.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: \"Experimentelle Beiträge zum Studium der septischen\r\nInfection,\" _Deutsch. Zeitschr. für Chir._, Bd. vi. p. 141.]\r\n\r\nThus we find that in the human subject and in experiments made upon\r\nanimals septic poisons introduced into the system following or near\r\ndelivery produce lesions similar to those found in puerperal fever. As\r\na further coincidence, we notice that, as in puerperal fever, the\r\nlesions from direct septic poisoning have nothing characteristic about\r\nthem, producing in one case pyæmia, in another partial peritonitis, in\r\nanother general peritonitis, in another diphtheritis, while in others\r\nthe lesions are comparatively trivial, these differences being due to\r\nvariable facta, such as the qualities of the septic poisons, the\r\npoints of entry into the organism, and the resistance offered by the\r\ninvaded tissues.\r\n\r\n2d. _Septicæmia is a disease characterized by the invariable presence\r\nin the organism infected of minute bodies generally termed\r\nbacteria._[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: In 1865, Mayrhofer (_Mon. Schr. f. Geburtsk._, vol.\r\nxxv., p. 112, 1865), at that time clinical assistant to the Lying-in\r\nService of Braun in Vienna, stimulated by the researches of Pasteur,\r\nmaintained that septic endometritis was the result of putrid\r\nfermentation within the uterine cavity, and drew attention to the\r\nvibrios--a term which he applied to the round as well as to the\r\nrod-like bacteria--as the source, and not the product, of\r\nputrefaction. He claimed that while in puerperal processes vibrios are\r\nalways present, in healthy women they never occur before the second,\r\nthird, or fourth day, and not always even then. The chief progress\r\nthat has been made as regards our knowledge of puerperal fever in the\r\nlast ten years has been in the direction of strengthening Mayrhofer's\r\nargument by careful experiment, and by defining the action of\r\nmicroscopic fungi in the production of septic morbid processes.]\r\n\r\nUntil very recently the whole subject of septicæmia has been in a\r\nstate of wellnigh hopeless confusion. From Gaspard and Panum, through\r\na long list of experimenters, hardly any two arrived at precisely\r\nsimilar {995} results. Something like an approach to order has,\r\nhowever, been produced since it has begun to be understood that the\r\neffects produced by septic fluids vary with the quality of the poison\r\nand the method of experimentation, and that to obtain identity in the\r\nresult there must be identity in all the conditions. Thus, Samuel has\r\nshown that the same organic substance produces different effects at\r\ndifferent stages of decomposition; again, that the enteritis which is\r\ncommonly quoted as characteristic of septic poisoning occurs, as a\r\nrule, in animals when the septic fluid is injected directly into the\r\nblood, and is rare when it finds its way into the circulation through\r\nthe lymphatics, as is the case usually in clinical experiences.[17]\r\nThere is one experimental point of extreme practical importance too in\r\nconnection with puerperal septicæmia--viz. that if the injection of a\r\nseptic fluid be made directly into a vessel, toxic effects speedily\r\nfollow, but are transitory, unless the amount of the fluid be large,\r\nor its virulence exceptional, or the animal very young;[18] whereas\r\nvery small amounts injected subcutaneously, by developing\r\nrapidly-spreading phlegmonous inflammation, resembling malignant\r\nerysipelas in man, are capable, after a period of incubation, of\r\nproducing fatal results; or they may, if injected into a shut cavity\r\nor underneath a fascia, lead to the development of an inflammation of\r\nan ichorous character. In other words, the eliminating organs suffice,\r\nunder ordinary conditions, to remove from the blood the same amount of\r\nseptic fluid which would prove fatal if injected into the tissues.[19]\r\nTo produce similar results the injections into the blood need to be\r\nrepeated at intervals. This experience leads us to the conclusion that\r\nin the tissues septic poison possesses the capacity of\r\nself-multiplication, and that in the local inflammation set up a\r\nreservoir is formed from which poison is continuously poured into the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Loc. cit._, p. 349.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"Traube und Gescheidlen, Versüche über Faülniss und den\r\nWiderstand des lebender Organismus,\" _Schles. Ges. f. vaterländische\r\nCultur_, Feb. 13, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: In some instances in which absorption from the tissues\r\nis very rapid the effects of subcutaneous injections may be similar to\r\nthose produced by injections made directly into the circulation, and\r\nthe local lesion be insignificant.]\r\n\r\nThis capacity of self-multiplication which septic fluids possess has\r\nrecently been found to be coincident with the presence of certain\r\nparasitic bodies, generically termed bacteria. All carefully-made\r\nexperiments serve to show that if a septic fluid be deprived of these\r\norganic bodies by boiling or filtration while it continues capable of\r\nproducing inflammation, the inflammation is usually of diminished\r\nintensity and remains local in its character;[20] whereas the bacteria\r\nretained upon the filter possess all the virulent properties of the\r\noriginal fluid.[21] This does not alone necessarily prove that the\r\nvirus resides in the bacteria, for it does not exclude the possibility\r\nthat both the virus and the bacteria remain upon the filter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: In filtration through porous earthenware cylinders the\r\nfiltrate possesses no phlogogenic properties.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Tiegel, _Correspondenzblatt für Schweizer Aertze_, 1871,\r\nS. 1275; Klebs, _Archiv für exp. Pathol. und Pharmakol._, Bd. i. Heft.\r\n1, S. 35.]\r\n\r\nSo far, attempts at isolating the microspores of septicæmia and\r\ncultivating them separately in vehicles composed of water holding in\r\nsolution inorganic constituents, or sterilized fluids containing\r\norganic matters, or of the semi-solid gelatinous substances\r\nrecommended by Koch, have been only partially successful in proving\r\nthem to be the sole source of {996} infection. Some earlier\r\nexperiments of Tiegel and Klebs[22] were attended with positive\r\nresults, and more recently confirmatory evidence has been furnished by\r\nPasteur and Doléris.[23] Hiller, rarely quoted now, arrived at\r\ndifferent conclusions. He found that bacteria washed in pure water\r\nwere innocuous.[24] But pure water had long before been proven by\r\nobservers to be inimical to the well-being of the organisms in\r\nquestion. Schüller says that Hiller's experiments prove apparently\r\nthat while a putrid fluid may be in the highest degree poisonous, its\r\ncomponent parts--viz. either the fluid or the bacteria singly--are\r\nneither deadly nor poisonous.[25] The fact is, that isolation\r\nexperiments are subject to what has hitherto been in most experiments\r\nan unavoidable source of error. As Davaine noted early in his\r\nobservations, the physiological action of bacteria is very dependent\r\non the constitution of the medium in which they are developed, which\r\nis in entire harmony with what is known of organisms much higher in\r\nthe scale. \"Many plants,\" says Burdon-Sanderson,[26] \"containing\r\nactive principles, become inert when transplanted from an appropriate\r\nsoil.\" Bucholtz, in a series of experiments designed to test the\r\ninfluence of antiseptics upon the vitality of bacteria, found not only\r\na difference between those taken directly from the infusion and those\r\ncultivated in artificial fluids, but between bacteria derived from the\r\nsame source and cultivated in modifications of the nutrient\r\nmedium.[27] Then, too, it is not always safe to transfer to the human\r\nspecies the results of experiments made upon the lower animals.\r\nIndeed, among animals, not only in different species, but in varieties\r\nof the same species, differences in the susceptibility to septicæmic\r\npoisons are found ranging from gradations as to the intensity of the\r\neffect produced to absolute immunity. In anthrax, a disease analogous\r\nto the one in question, the bacterial origin has been established\r\nbeyond dispute by the inoculation of isolated bacilli, which multiply\r\nin the blood and permeate in enormous numbers the lungs, liver,\r\nkidneys, spleen, and glandular structures. If the same unequivocal\r\ntestimony has as yet not been obtained from isolation experiments as\r\nregards septicæmia, it is reasonable to suppose that this is due to\r\nthe defects in the technique, for which it is presumable the ingenuity\r\nof investigators will in future find the remedy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Archiv für exp.

Here the ground is sufficiently solid, and, judged by\r\nordinary laws of scientific evidence, the pathological importance of\r\nthe microspores {997} may be regarded as established. To be sure, we\r\nfind them in tongue-scrapings of healthy individuals, but\r\ntongue-scrapings are poisonous if injected into the tissues. That they\r\ndo not ordinarily prove so in the mouth is no more singular than that\r\nwoorari can be swallowed with impunity. Tiegel[28] has endeavored to\r\nshow that round bacteria are found normally in the internal organs of\r\nthe body; but Koch[29] states that he has on many occasions examined\r\nnormal blood and normal tissues by means which prevented the\r\npossibility of overlooking bacteria, or of confounding them with\r\ngranular masses of equal size, and that he has never in a single\r\ninstance found organisms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Arch. f. Path. Anat. u. Physiol. u. f. klin. Med._,\r\nvol. lx. p. 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: On _Traumatic Infective Diseases_, New Sydenham Soc.\r\npublication p. 15.]\r\n\r\nIt is stated that bacteria are sometimes absent from the blood\r\nwithdrawn during life in septic diseases. As, however, their constant\r\npresence has been confirmed in the vessels and glomeruli of the\r\nkidneys, it is fair to assume that those organs, acting as filters,\r\nmust have received the colonies observed in them from the general\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of obtaining bacteria from the blood in many cases\r\nduring life in septic diseases does not, however, as was once\r\nsupposed, invalidate the theory of their pathogenic importance.\r\nSepticæmia is at present employed as a collective term for a number of\r\nprocesses which may occur singly or in combination with one another.\r\nWhen a relatively large quantity of a putrid fluid is injected into\r\nthe veins of an animal, death follows from the action of a chemical\r\npoison (sepsin). The blood during life rarely displays the presence of\r\nbacteria, the latter disappearing in the circulation. In animals thus\r\npoisoned blood does not possess infectious properties. This form is\r\ntermed putrid intoxication. That the poison in these cases is,\r\nhowever, produced by the bacteria is shown by experiments of\r\nGutmann,[30] who demonstrated that bacteria from a drop of putrid\r\nblood cultivated in Cohn's solution developed in the fluid a poison\r\nwhich, when injected into the veins of dogs, occasioned death with all\r\nthe symptoms of putrid intoxication. Still more conclusive were the\r\nexperiments of Koch. This observer injected four drops of putrid blood\r\nbeneath the skin of mice. The latter died in from four to eight hours.\r\nThere were no bacteria in the blood, and the blood was not infectious.\r\nWhen, however, a single drop was injected, the mice often remained\r\nunaffected, but in a third of the cases they became ill after\r\ntwenty-four hours, death occurring in from forty to sixty hours. The\r\nblood during life communicated the same disease to other mice, and\r\nbacilli were always present in large numbers. In these cases the\r\ndissolved poison in the fluid injected was too small in amount to\r\ndestroy life, and death resulted only after a period of incubation as\r\na consequence of the multiplication of bacilli in the blood and in the\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Vide Semmer, \"Putride Intoxication,\" etc., _Virchow's\r\nArch._, vol. lxxxi. p. 109.]\r\n\r\nIn another class of cases Koch experimented, not with putrid blood,\r\nbut with a fluid produced by macerating a piece of mouse-skin in\r\ndistilled water. Of this he injected a syringeful into the back of a\r\nrabbit. The result was peritonitis, swelling of the spleen, gray\r\nwedge-shaped patches in the liver, and in the lungs were found\r\ndark-red patches the size of a pea, devoid of air--all appearances in\r\nharmony with what is designated as pyæmia. Oval micrococci were found\r\nin great numbers {998} everywhere throughout the body. But the point\r\nof special interest in the present connection is the fact that\r\nwherever these micrococci come in contact with the red\r\nblood-corpuscles the latter stick together and become arrested in the\r\nminute capillary network. The thrombi thus formed are further enlarged\r\nby the deposition of micrococci, which multiply, block up individual\r\ncapillary loops, and invade contiguous tissues. In the blood-current\r\nitself, however, the micrococci do not increase in numbers, and cannot\r\nalways be found in the circulation upon a single examination, but\r\nDoléris[31] assures us that in puerperal fever by repeated trials,\r\nespecially after a chill, he has never failed to demonstrate their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _La Fievre Puerperale, etc._, p. 120.]\r\n\r\nAs to the exact manner in which these minute bodies exercise their\r\npernicious influence, whether they operate mechanically, or whether\r\nthey produce a virus in the process of nutritive activity, or whether,\r\nas is probable, both suppositions are correct, must be decided by\r\nfuture investigations. It is enough for us to note that the connection\r\nbetween sepsis and bacteria is intimate and vital.\r\n\r\n3d. _Pathogenic bacteria are invariably associated with puerperal\r\nfever, and to them the infectious qualities of the disease are due._ I\r\nhave been explicit regarding the evidence concerning bacteria in\r\nseptic diseases, because it places the question of the infectious\r\ngroup of puerperal fever cases in the following position: Experiences\r\noccurring clinically, as well as those produced upon animals, teach us\r\nthat certain lesions and symptoms, similar to those we are accustomed\r\nto regard as characteristic of puerperal fever, results from septic\r\npoisoning. In a large class of cases, however, the connection between\r\nchildbed fever and sepsis has been deduced rather from analogy than\r\ndirect proof. For those who chose to regard such as due to a specific\r\npoison peculiar to the puerperal state there was really no objection.\r\nIf, however, bacteria are characteristic of septic poisoning, the\r\nquestion presents itself in a different light, and we have to inquire\r\nwhether, in the less obvious cases, bacteria are present in puerperal\r\nfever in the proportions and groupings that we find them in other\r\ndiseases due to putrid infection. Now, it is precisely proof of this\r\nnature that has recently been abundantly rendered.\r\n\r\nWaldeyer,[32] Orth,[33] Heiberg,[34] and Von Recklinghausen[35] found\r\nthe tissues and lymphatics of the parametria filled with pus-like\r\nmasses, which consisted, in addition to pus-cells, chiefly of\r\nbacteria. Bacteria swarmed in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity. In\r\none case examined by Waldeyer six hours after death, while the body\r\nwas still warm, the peritoneal exudation was like an emulsion, and\r\nfurnished an abundant deposit which consisted almost entirely of\r\nbacteria. Orth injected ten minims of peritoneal fluid from a woman\r\ndead of puerperal fever into the abdomen of a rabbit. As the animal\r\nwas dying he broke up the medulla oblongata, and found in the\r\nperitoneal fluid enormous quantities of these {999} organisms. In\r\npuerperal fever round bacteria have been likewise found, though in\r\nless quantities, in the lymphatics of the diaphragm and in the fluids\r\nof the pleura, the pericardium, and the ventricles of the brain. In\r\npost-mortem examinations of fresh subjects the serous fluids,\r\nwithdrawn under proper precautions, do not contain round bacteria\r\nexcept in cases of septic infection.[36] Orth found in the purulent\r\ncontents of the vessels of the funis, in children who died of sepsis,\r\nprecisely the same formations as existed in the exudations of the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: \"Ueber das Verkommen von Bacterien bei der\r\ndiphtheritischen Form des puerperal Fiebers,\" _Archiv für\r\nGynaekologie_, vol. iii. p. 293.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: \"Untersuchungen über puerperal Fieber,\" _Virchow's\r\nArchiv_, vol. lviii. p. 437.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Die puerperalen und pyæmischen Processe_, Leipzig,\r\n1873.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: For the views of Von Recklinghausen I am indebted to his\r\npupil Steurer. Vide the writer's paper on \"The Nature, Origin, and\r\nPrevention of Puerperal Fever,\" _Trans. of the International Med.\r\nCongress_, Phila., 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Klebs, \"Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Pathogenen\r\nSchistomyceten,\" _Archiv für exp. Pathol. und Pharmakol._, vol. iv. p.\r\n441 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nDoléris, in a remarkable essay already referred to, published in\r\n1880,[37] furnishes not only conclusive evidence of the presence of\r\nbacteria in the various tissues and serous cavities of women dying of\r\npuerperal fever, but has added the evidence of their pathogenic\r\ncharacter by cultivating them apart in sterilized fluids, and by\r\nreproducing in animals, by means of subcutaneous injections of the\r\nisolated bacteria, the infarctions, the blood-changes, and the\r\nsuppurative processes of the original disease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _La Fievre Puerperale et les Organismes Inférieurs._]\r\n\r\nSo far, the generic term bacteria has been employed to indicate the\r\ndisease-germs which are the active agents of infection in puerperal\r\nfever. It is not, however, intended to assume that the germs of septic\r\nprocesses are all identical, or that they all produce precisely the\r\nsame pathological conditions. Koch, indeed, maintains that a distinct\r\nspecific bacterial form is found in such closely-allied affections as\r\npyæmia, septicæmia, gangrene, and erysipelas, the different forms\r\npossessing, however, this link in common--viz. that they are alike\r\ngenerated in putrefying media. Singularly enough, the bacterium termo\r\nand the bacterium commune--to which the fetidity of matters undergoing\r\nputrefaction is due--are in themselves harmless. They are rapidly\r\ndestroyed in the circulation, and are not inoculable. Fetid discharges\r\nfrom wounds are not therefore necessarily dangerous. The putrid odor\r\nserves a useful purpose, as it gives warning of the existence of\r\nconditions which favor the development of life-destroying organisms;\r\nbut the latter may develop without the concurrence of the forms which\r\ngive rise to putrefaction--a fact of considerable importance in view\r\nof the common belief that septic infection is excluded by the absence\r\nof fetid odors.\r\n\r\nIn puerperal fever Doléris found the prevailing pathogenic organisms\r\nconsisted of bacilli or rods, and micrococci or round bacteria in the\r\nvarieties of micrococci, simple points; diplococci, double points; and\r\nchains or wreaths. The bacilli he regarded as the source of acute,\r\nrapid septicæmia, while pus-production was associated with the\r\nmultiplication of the round bacteria, and especially of the\r\ndiplococci.\r\n\r\n4th. _The presence of germs in puerperal fever serves not only to fix\r\ncases hitherto doubtful in the category of septic diseases, but\r\naffords the most satisfactory explanation of the protean phenomena of\r\npuerperal fever itself._\r\n\r\nWe have seen, from both Koch's and Gutmann's experiments upon animals,\r\nthat death may occur independently of bacteria by the rapid absorption\r\nof a chemical poison developed in a putrefying fluid. Clinical\r\nexperiences, such as the speedy death sometimes observed when retained\r\ncoagula or portions of placenta undergo decomposition within the\r\nuterine cavity, renders it probable that similar cases of putrid\r\nintoxication are {1000} not unknown in puerperal women, though, so\r\nfar, the anatomical demonstration of the fact has not been furnished.\r\n\r\nIn cases, however, where puerperal fever has a distinct period of\r\nincubation, and progresses step by step to the fatal ending, bacteria\r\nare always found invading the tissues of the genital canal. In rare\r\ncases they pass by the Fallopian tube to the peritoneal cavity and\r\nexcite salpingitis and peritonitis. More commonly from local lesions\r\nthey enter the canalicular spaces of the connective tissue forming the\r\nframework of the genital canal, which is continuous with the\r\nsubperitoneal connective tissue of the pelvis. From the canalicular\r\nspace they enter the lymphatics. Cellulitis is excited by their\r\npresence, and the lymphatic glands become inflamed and enlarged. In\r\npernicious forms they produce a sero-purulent oedema, which spreads\r\nrapidly with a wave-like progress after the manner of erysipelas; or\r\nin milder cases the progress of the disease-germs is arrested by the\r\nlymphatic glands or the resistance offered by the tissues themselves,\r\nand the ordinary circumscribed phlegmon is produced. By the lymphatics\r\nwhich accompany the vessels of the Fallopian tubes they reach the\r\novaries (puerperal ovaritis), and by the broad ligaments they pass to\r\nsubperitoneal tissues of the iliac and lumbar regions. Through the\r\nsame system they are conveyed to the great serous cavities of the\r\nbody. In the peritoneum they give rise, unless death occurs too\r\nspeedily, to pyæmic peritonitis, which, unlike the traumatic form, is\r\nattended with but little pain, and for which the claim has been set up\r\nthat it is peculiar to puerperal fever. The wide stomata upon the\r\nabdominal surface of the diaphragm allows the facile entrance of the\r\norganisms into its lymphatics. Waldeyer found in diaphragmitis the\r\nlymphatics of the diaphragm filled with bacteria. And thus, following\r\nthe lymphatic system, if we only admit that bacteria are the active\r\nagents of sepsis, the frequency, in severe types of puerperal fever,\r\nof inflammation of the serous membranes of the peritoneum, the pleuræ,\r\nthe pericardium, the meninges, and the joints finds an easy\r\nexplanation. Nor is it altogether accident which determines in\r\ndifferent cases the precise serous membranes which are affected. The\r\nwidespread ramifications of the lymphatic system would naturally give\r\nrise to eccentric inflammations in place of those following the\r\napparent continuity of tissues.\r\n\r\nThe ductus thoracicus is the principal channel through which the\r\nbacteria enter the blood. It is possible that they may further obtain\r\naccess into the circulation through the radicles which furnish the\r\ncommunications between the capillaries and the lymphatics. We have\r\nseen that bacteria are found with difficulty in the blood during life.\r\nA few hours after death they swarm in that fluid. That they do,\r\nhowever, enter the general circulation during life is incontestable.\r\nSteurer writes: \"As the kidneys are the great filters of the human\r\nsystem, I never neglected to examine them, and almost invariably found\r\nmicrococci filling the arterioles and glomeruli.\" This is in\r\ncorrespondence with what occurs in other septic diseases, and accounts\r\nfor the albuminuria and interstitial nephritis which often supervene\r\nin the advanced stages.\r\n\r\nThe action of the bacilli upon the blood differs materially from that\r\nof the round bacteria. So soon as the latter come in contact with the\r\nred corpuscles, the corpuscles stick together and form larger or\r\nsmaller clots in the blood. They then are no longer able to pass\r\nthrough the minute {1001} capillary networks, but are arrested in the\r\nlarger or smaller vessels (Koch). The micrococci in the resulting\r\ninfarctions multiply, and migrate into the vessels and cellular tissue\r\nof the neighborhood. Thus fresh foci of infection are formed. Or by\r\ntheir destructive action they may, when situated near the serous\r\nsurfaces, penetrate into the serous cavities, and in this way\r\nindirectly occasion peritonitis, pleurisy, meningitis, and purulent\r\ninflammations of the joints. When the micrococci enter directly into\r\nthe circulation, they sometimes, in passing through the heart, adhere\r\nto the endocardium and the valves, where they cause exudation and\r\nulceration, and give rise to the so-called endocarditis ulcerosa\r\npuerperalis.[38] The red globules of the blood undergo changes of\r\nshape, assume a stellate aspect, and rapidly disappear. The white\r\nglobules are greatly increased in numbers, and the blood itself\r\nbecomes nearly colorless. A certain amount of light is thrown upon\r\nthese blood-changes by Doléris, who added micrococci to the fresh\r\nblood of a frog and watched the ensuing changes under the microscope.\r\nThe micrococci could be seen in the act of penetrating the red\r\nglobules, which thereupon lost their color and became shrunken, and,\r\nfollowing the discharge of the organisms, which meantime had\r\nmultiplied in an astonishing manner, little or nothing of the original\r\nglobules remained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Heiberg, _Die puerperalen und pyæmischen Processe_,\r\nLeipzig, 1873, pp. 22 and 34, with references to cases reported by\r\nWiege and Eberth.]\r\n\r\nIn the bacillar form of septicæmia the blood is dark and has a\r\nsemi-gelatinous appearance, compared by French writers to\r\npartially-cooked gooseberry jelly. The red globules, though they\r\nexhibit the various stages of deformation, are not diminished in\r\nnumber. The disease is further characterized by ecchymoses and minute\r\napoplectic effusions, and by the absence of pus-formation. In the\r\nartificial septicæmia produced by Koch in mice by means of bacilli the\r\nrod-like organisms were found to enter the white corpuscles and to\r\ncompass their destruction. They did not cause the red globules to\r\nadhere together, and there was no clogging of the capillary\r\ncirculation. All the principal structures of the animals subjected to\r\nexperiment were infiltrated with bacilli. The distribution of the\r\nlatter was apparently accomplished by the blood-vessels, and not by\r\nthe lymphatics, the bacilli probably effecting their entrance into the\r\nvessels by virtue of their penetrative power, in place of traversing\r\npreformed pathways. Possibly it is this action of the bacilli which\r\ncauses the weakening of the vessel-walls, as evidenced by the large\r\nnumber of red corpuscles which pass out from them.\r\n\r\nIn puerperal fever it is rare to find either round bacteria or bacilli\r\nacting singly as the agent of infection. As a rule, both forms exist\r\ntogether in varying proportions, the predominant form, however,\r\ndetermining in general the character of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThrombosis of the veins may be a physiological phenomenon, or may be\r\ndue to an alteration of the blood, to weakness of the heart, or to\r\nlocal influences. So long as the clot remains firm its influence is\r\nlimited to disturbances of the circulation. The pyæmic symptoms--viz.\r\nsuppuration of the coagulum, the separation of emboli, and the\r\nformation of metastatic abscesses--are always dependent upon the\r\npresence of round bacteria. In phlebitis the latter are found in the\r\nendothelium and in the sheaths of the veins. The inflammation of the\r\nveins is followed by {1002} thrombosis. According to Doléris,\r\nmicrococci derived from the blood are deposited upon the central\r\nextremities of the clots; beyond these dépôts a fresh inflammation is\r\nset up, followed by fibrinous coagulation. Thus the micrococci become\r\nimprisoned between two plugs. The same process may be repeated until a\r\nseries of abscesses are formed. For a time no mischief may ensue.\r\nFinally, however, the resistance of the outworks is overcome, an\r\nembolus becomes detached, and an infectious abscess is opened into the\r\nblood--an event which is announced by an intense chill and the\r\nfamiliar systemic derangement.\r\n\r\nIn septic diseases death takes place from apnoea, partly from the\r\ninability of the blood-corpuscles to carry oxygen to the tissues, and\r\npartly from paralysis of the nerve-centres.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Schüller, \"Exp. Beiträge zur Studium der Septischen\r\nInfection,\" _Deutsche Zeitschr. f. Chir._, vol. vi. p. 149 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIn hospital epidemics of puerperal fever diphtheritic patches situated\r\nupon the lesions of the vulva and in the course of the utero-vaginal\r\ncanal are sometimes observed. Steurer found these patches were always\r\nassociated with loss of substance, and were composed of disintegrated\r\nfibrin, white and red blood-globules, and colonies of round bacteria\r\nin great abundance. Morphologically, these so-called diphtheritic\r\npatches are identical with those which appear in the throat.\r\nPallen[40] has reported an instance of the simultaneous occurrence of\r\npuerperal diphtheritis in the mother and throat diphtheritis in the\r\ntwo-weeks' old child. In lying-in hospitals it is the genital organs,\r\nas the locus resistentiæ minoris, and not the throat, which are the\r\nusual points of attack.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Trans. N.Y. Obst. Soc._, 1876-78, p. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe question as to the extent to which erysipelas and puerperal fever\r\nare cognate diseases is in a fair way to be solved by recent\r\ninvestigation. Orth took the contents of a vesicle from an\r\nerysipelatous patient which contained bacteria in great abundance, and\r\nemployed the same for injections under the skin of rabbits. In this\r\nway he succeeded in producing in these animals a species of erysipelas\r\nmalignum. In the subcutaneous oedema and affected portions of the skin\r\nhe found enormous masses of bacteria, so far exceeding in quantity the\r\namount introduced as to prove an abundant new production.[41] Samuel\r\nproduced similar results by the injection of ordinary putrid fluids\r\ncontaining round bacteria. An affection resembling simple erysipelas\r\nhe obtained most frequently by the application of fluid to a wound\r\ntorn open after the second or third day.[42] Lukomski found that\r\nerysipelas could be produced by fluid containing micrococci even when\r\nputrefaction did not exist. The contents of erysipelatous vesicles\r\ncontaining no micrococci excited no morbid manifestations. Where the\r\nerysipelatous process was fresh and progressing micrococci were found\r\nin great abundance in the lymphatics and canalicular spaces. Where the\r\nprocess was retrogressive, there were no micrococci to be found, even\r\nin cases in which inflammation existed to an intense degree.[43]\r\nDoléris submitted to the culture-process of Pasteur fluid obtained\r\nfrom vesicles which developed in the course of facial erysipelas in a\r\nman of forty years. Micrococci in chains were found in the liquids\r\nemployed identical with those he had discovered in puerperal fever. In\r\nmany cases I have seen an erysipelatous inflammation start from a\r\npuerperal diphtheritic ulcer {1003} upon the introitus vaginæ, and\r\nextend outward over the buttocks, the thighs, and the lower portion of\r\nthe abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: \"Untersuchungen über Erysipel.,\" _Arch. für exp. Pathol.\r\nund Pharmakol._, Bd. i. S. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Arch. für exp. Path. und Pharmak._, Bd. i. S. 335, u.\r\nff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: \"Untersuchungen über Erysipel.,\" _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.\r\nlx. S. 430.]\r\n\r\nVirchow[44] has so far given in his adhesion to the new school as to\r\nsay: \"Especially in this connection are to be mentioned the\r\ndiphtheritic process and the erysipelatous, especially erysipelas\r\nmalignum. The granular deposit in diphtheritically affected tissues,\r\nof which I formerly spoke, has more and more proven to be of a\r\nparasitic character. What we formerly regarded as simple, organic\r\ngranules, as infiltration or exudation, has since proven to be a dense\r\naggregation of micro-organisms which penetrate into the tissues and\r\ncells to compass their destruction.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Die Fortschritte der Krieg's Heilkunde_, Berlin, 1874.]\r\n\r\nThus we find in surgical fever, in puerperal fever, in diphtheria, and\r\nin erysipelas the presence of a common element which links them\r\ntogether, and which establishes the relationship which has long been\r\nrecognized as existing between these various processes.\r\n\r\n4th. _The differences between surgical and puerperal septicæmia are\r\ndue to differences partly structural and partly physiological in the\r\nwounded surfaces exposed to septic contamination._\r\n\r\nA certain amount of misapprehension has arisen from the circumstance\r\nthat along with many coincidences in the symptoms of puerperal and\r\nsurgical fever there are observable differences which, from a purely\r\nclinical point of view, would justify a separate classification of the\r\ntwo affections. It will not do, however, to ignore the fact that the\r\nconditions which prevail in the parturient canal subsequent to labor\r\nhave no strict analogue in the lesions which the surgeon is called\r\nupon to treat, and that therefore a complete identity as to all the\r\nclinical features of puerperal and surgical fever would hardly be\r\nwithin the range of possibility.\r\n\r\nIn the puerperal state it is necessary to take into account the\r\nblood-changes induced by pregnancy, the effects of shock and\r\nexhaustion in protracted labors, the frequency of hemorrhage, the deep\r\nsituation of puerperal wounds, the presence of clots, decidua, and\r\ndead tissue in a state of disintegration or decomposition, the ease\r\nwith which deleterious matters are absorbed by the wide lymphatic\r\ninterspaces, the serous infiltration of the pelvic tissues, the\r\nexaggerated size of the lymphatics and veins, and the proximity of the\r\nperitoneal cavity.\r\n\r\nSamuel,[45] in speaking of the immunities and dispositions to septic\r\npoisoning, says: \"The statistical frequency of septic puerperal\r\ndisease is due to the length of the parturient canal, to the fact that\r\nthrough this long passage there must pass all the pathological and\r\nphysiological excretions, and to the soiling of these parts with\r\nfingers, instruments, and secretions which have become the bearers of\r\nsepsis.\" He found, on the other hand, that it was extremely difficult\r\nto produce a progressive ichorous condition by daily painting an open\r\nstump with a septic fluid,[46] though the same was readily obtained\r\nwhen an infinitesimal quantity of septic fluid was injected underneath\r\na fascia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: \"Ueber die Wirkung des Faülniss Process auf den lebenden\r\nOrganismus,\" _Arch. f. exp. Pathologie_, vol. i. p. 343.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Loc. cit._, p. 339.]\r\n\r\n5th. _In the present state of our scientific knowledge it is necessary\r\nto admit that there is a limited number of febrile and inflammatory\r\ndisturbances occurring in puerperal women, the bacterial origin of\r\nwhich may be fairly questioned._ As illustrations of this class may be\r\n{1004} mentioned: 1. Cases of catarrhal endometritis due to errors of\r\ndiet and exposure. Indeed, I have frequently, in hospital practice,\r\nbeen able to trace severe cases of cellulitis, pelvic peritonitis, and\r\ngeneral peritonitis occurring in the winter season to the patient\r\ngetting out of bed dripping with perspiration, and clad only in a\r\nnight-dress, and going thus barefooted over a cold, uncarpeted floor\r\nto the water-closet. 2. Cases of puerperal disorders proceeding from\r\nemotional causes, the nervous system furnishing the first impulse to\r\nthe disturbed action. 3. Cases of excessive vulnerability in\r\nnon-pregnant women; individuals are sometimes found so susceptible\r\nthat a parametritis follows a simple application of the tincture of\r\niodine to the cervix. 4. Cases of pelvic peritonitis starting from old\r\nintra-peritoneal adhesions. 5. Cases of peritonitis and\r\nretro-peritoneal inflammations secondary to ulcerative processes in\r\nthe cæcum or the descending colon. This condition is apt to be masked\r\nduring pregnancy, but starts into activity during childbed as a\r\nconsequence of fecal accumulation or of excessive purgation.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means easy to decide as to the precise nature of local\r\ninflammations following lacerations of the cervix and the bruising or\r\ncrushing of the soft parts in long or instrumental labors. The\r\nmarvellous absence of heat, pain, redness, and swelling in wounds\r\ntreated in strict accordance with the principles of Lister, the very\r\nslight reaction when the atmosphere is pure, and the severity of these\r\nsymptoms in overcrowded hospitals, tend indeed to strengthen the\r\nbelief that even the simplest inflammations proceeding from wounds owe\r\ntheir origin in great part to septic germs. But, on the other hand, in\r\nhospital practice it is not uncommon to observe puerperal\r\ninflammations and febrile conditions which possess this distinctive\r\npeculiarity--that they in no wise visibly affect the health of\r\npuerperal patients in their vicinity. The symptoms of blood-poisoning\r\ntoo are either absent or present to a subordinate extent. Probably the\r\ndifficulty is best solved by assuming with Genzmer and Volkmann[47]\r\nthat there is such a thing as an aseptic surgical fever due to the\r\nabsorption of the products of physiological tissue-changes at the seat\r\nof injury. In surgical cases, even where the precautions of Listerism\r\nhave been faultlessly observed, febrile movements of considerable\r\nintensity, but of no prognostic signification, are of frequent\r\noccurrence. While in puerperal women we can never exclude the\r\npossibility of the septic infection of puerperal wounds, it is in\r\naccordance with clinical experience to assume that a high fever\r\nbelonging to the aseptic class may coincide with a septic process of\r\ninsignificant proportions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Genzmer and Volkmann, \"Ueber septisches und aseptisches\r\nWundfieber,\" _Samml. klin. Vorträge_, No. 121.]\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS.--As in other infectious diseases, there is, from the\r\ntime of the entry of the poison into the system up to the outbreak of\r\nfever, a distinct period of incubation. The first febrile symptoms\r\nusually occur within three days of the birth of the child. An attack\r\ncoming on a few hours after childbirth is indicative of infection\r\nduring or previous to labor. The third day is the one upon which\r\nordinarily the beginning of the fever is to be anticipated. After the\r\nfifth day an attack is rare, and at the end of a week patients may be\r\nregarded as having reached the point of safety. Apparent exceptions to\r\nthis rule are probably referable to cases of mild parametritis, in\r\nwhich the initial {1005} fever and the pain were insufficient to\r\nattract attention to the existence of local inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of puerperal fever vary with the character of the local\r\naffections and with the extent to which the general system\r\nparticipates in the disturbed action. The different groups of\r\npuerperal processes possess the following pathognomonic symptoms--viz.\r\nincreased temperature, enlargement of the spleen, disturbed\r\ninvolution, and sensitiveness of the uterus upon pressure (Braun).\r\n\r\nIn most cases the fever is ushered in by chilly sensations or by a\r\nwell-defined chill. This symptom, however, does not possess much\r\nprognostic importance. A chill is significant of a sudden change\r\nbetween the temperature of the skin and that of the surrounding\r\nmedium. It may, therefore, be absent in pernicious forms of fever,\r\nprovided only that the temperature changes are inaugurated slowly,\r\nwhereas it may follow a trifling increase of the body-heat if, as\r\nsometimes happens in sleep, the moist skin is exposed to cool currents\r\nof air. Repeated chills indicate phlebitis and pyæmia.\r\n\r\nIn order to grasp the many symptoms of puerperal fever, it is\r\nnecessary to keep separately in mind the clinical features of each of\r\nthe local processes, although in fact the latter rarely occur singly,\r\nbut to a greater or less extent in combination with others.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of ENDOMETRITIS AND ENDOCOLPITIS.--The uncomplicated\r\ncatarrhal inflammation of the uterus and vagina is the most frequent\r\nand the mildest of the diseases of childbed. In endometritis the\r\nuterus is large, flabby, and sensitive upon pressure; the after-pains\r\nare often unusually severe, involution is retarded, and the lochia\r\nbecome fetid, remain sanguinolent for a longer period than usual, and\r\nat the outset may be temporarily suspended. Sometimes the large\r\nintestine is distended with flatus. In endocolpitis the vaginal\r\ndischarge is thin and purulent, the patient experiences pain and\r\nburning in the acts of defecation and urination, and, where the wounds\r\nof the vulva and vagina assume an ulcerative character, there is often\r\nfound at the same time inflammatory oedema of the labia.\r\n\r\nThe fever in these cases is ushered in frequently, but not always, by\r\nchilly feelings, and the temperature reaches its height usually upon\r\nthe evening of the third or fourth day, is remittent, almost\r\nintermittent in character, and rarely exceeds 102° to 103° F. In mild\r\nforms the occurrence of the fever is often overlooked or is referred\r\nto disturbance produced by the secretion of the milk. In severer\r\nattacks the febrile symptoms may continue from three to seven days. At\r\nthe end of a week the swelling of the labia subsides, the discharge\r\nbecomes thick, and ulcers, if present, begin to assume a healthy\r\ngranulating appearance.\r\n\r\nIn diphtheritic ulcerations, and in endometritis due to decomposing\r\nremains of the ovum, the load condition is often complicated by the\r\ninvasion of the neighboring tissues.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of PARAMETRITIS and PERIMETRITIS (Pelvic\r\nperitonitis[48]).--The symptoms of these two affections, as would be\r\nnaturally {1006} expected from the proximity of the peritoneum to the\r\npelvic connective tissue, for the most part overlap. It must be very\r\nrare for one form to occur entirely independent of the other. For this\r\nreason it will be found convenient to consider first the symptoms\r\ncommon to both morbid processes, and subsequently to direct attention\r\nto what are believed to be points of distinction between them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The following clinical history, together with the\r\nstatistical details, is borrowed in great part from the description of\r\nOlshausen (\"Ueber puerperale Parametritis und Perimetritis,\"\r\n_Volkmann's Samml. klin. Vortr._, No. 28), the exactitude of which I\r\nhave had abundant opportunity to verify.]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of incubation there are usually no prodromic\r\nsymptoms. Elevations of temperature in the course of the first twelve\r\nhours following labor are equally frequent under perfectly normal\r\nconditions. Suspicious symptoms are disturbed sleep, excessively\r\npainful after-pains, and a pulse of 80 to 90.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the fever occurs in 90 per cent. within the first\r\nfour days of childbed; most frequently upon the second or third day,\r\nand taking place upon the fourth day in scarcely 12 to 15 per cent. of\r\nthe cases. If five days have elapsed without fever, the period of\r\ndanger, with very rare exceptions, may be regarded as having passed.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the fever, especially in perimetritis, is ushered in by\r\nchilly sensations or by an intense chill. The temperature rises\r\nrapidly, though the highest point is usually not reached before the\r\nsecond, and in rare cases not before the third, day. In most cases the\r\nheat in the axilla exceeds 103°, and may even mount up to 105°. The\r\ndecline occurs gradually, the fever ending in 70 per cent. in the\r\ncourse of a week, in 20 per cent. in two weeks, and only in 10 per\r\ncent. extending beyond that period. Protracted cases indicate abscess\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe fever does not, however, always pursue a regular course. In place\r\nof progressively declining until the termination is reached, the high\r\ntemperature of the second day may be attained upon one or more\r\noccasions. The morning remissions are at first slight, but become\r\nmarked as the disease approaches its close. In cases of long duration\r\nthe morning hours are often free from fever, a circumstance calculated\r\nto mislead a physician who sees his patient but once a day. A pulse of\r\n80 to 90 beats, a disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and sensitiveness\r\nto pressure upon the sides of the uterus are, however, symptoms which\r\nshould serve as a warning of some disturbing cause, and should lead\r\nthe physician to renew his visit in the latter part of the day.\r\n\r\nIf, from a mistaken notion that the morbid process has come to an end,\r\nthe patient is allowed prematurely to resume her household duties, the\r\npains across the abdomen and along the hip and thigh return, and an\r\nexamination reveals the existence of exudation in the pelvic cavity or\r\nupon an iliac fossa.\r\n\r\nErrors of this kind are most frequent in cases of parametritis\r\nassociated with slight peritoneal inflammation, as the local pain is\r\nthen insignificant, and the initial chill, happening on the third or\r\nfourth day, is apt to be ascribed to engorgement of the breasts.\r\n\r\nRelapses after the complete disappearance of febrile disturbance occur\r\nin 15 to 20 per cent. They are usually shorter, but sometimes more\r\nobstinate, than the original attack. As a rare exception may be\r\nmentioned cases with evening remissions and morning exacerbations.\r\n\r\nIn circumscribed pelvic inflammations the pulse rarely exceeds 120\r\nbeats to the minute. A pulse of 140, of more than half a day's\r\nduration, betokens severe septic complications, and is therefore of\r\nevil omen. In {1007} some cases the slow pulse observed after labor\r\nmakes its influence felt in the first day or two of the fever, so that\r\nthe curious phenomenon may be witnessed of a temperature of 104°\r\ncoinciding for a time with a pulse ranging between 50 and 70 beats to\r\nthe minute.\r\n\r\nAs regards other symptoms, headache and sleeplessness are rarely\r\nabsent. Profuse sweating follows the first febrile attack, and\r\nfrequently recurs during the course of the disease.\r\n\r\nPain is present at the onset in the majority of cases, and is then\r\nusually most violent. The spontaneous pain, which is due to the\r\naffection of the peritoneum, subsides in great part in the course of\r\none or two days, but the sides of the uterus remain sensitive to\r\npressure. In the rare cases of pure parametritis, however, this\r\nsymptom may be absent altogether. The pain, like that from the\r\ninflammation of serous membranes, is of a lancinating character.\r\nSometimes it is associated only with the contractions of the uterus.\r\nAfter-pains occurring under unusual circumstances, as in primiparæ or\r\nafter the third day, are to be regarded with suspicion.\r\n\r\nVomiting occurs occasionally, but is comparatively rare unless the\r\nperitonitis becomes diffused and spreads to the region of the stomach.\r\nThe appetite is lost, and only returns, as a rule, with the departure\r\nof the fever. The tongue is coated and moist, and constipation is\r\ncommon. In other cases there is diarrhoea with rumbling in the bowels,\r\nbut without pain or tenesmus. The urinary secretion is rarely\r\ninterfered with, and when this is the case it indicates the extension\r\nof the inflammation to the peritoneum covering the bladder.\r\n\r\nMost cases of perimetritis and parametritis terminate in five or ten\r\ndays, the fever and other symptoms gradually subsiding. When, as may\r\nhappen in exceptional instances, the temperature falls suddenly from a\r\nhigh degree to one below the normal level, the body grows icy cold,\r\nthe pulse becomes small and irregular, and symptoms of collapse\r\ndevelop. But in twelve to twenty-four hours the symptoms of collapse\r\nsubside, and the disease reaches its end with a disappearance of the\r\nalarming manifestations.\r\n\r\nIf the fever subsides within a week exudation is somewhat rare. Its\r\ncontinuance beyond that date should lead to a careful exploration of\r\nthe pelvic organs. The exudation is usually demonstrable in the course\r\nof the second week or at the beginning of the third week. It is\r\nrecognized, according to its location, by external or by internal\r\nexamination, or, where the deposit is considerable, by both methods.\r\nIn most cases the deposit is extra-peritoneal, and is situated between\r\nthe folds of the broad ligament, above and to the sides of the vaginal\r\ncul-de-sac. It has generally a rounded form, though with less\r\nconvexity than fibrous and ovarian tumors. Sometimes, however, the\r\ntumor is flat below, like a board. It seldom exceeds in size that of a\r\nlarge apple. In fresh exudations the sensation produced is often that\r\nof a hard tumor surrounded by a softer layer, due to continued\r\nsucculence of the soft parts. In a few weeks they may reach or exceed\r\nthe hardness of a fibroid tumor. The older the tumor, unless\r\nsuppuration sets in, the less sensitive it becomes. Often the\r\nexudation extends to the pelvic walls. The uterus, as a rule, is\r\nfixed, and in cases of large tumors becomes pushed toward the opposite\r\nside, while as a consequence of later shrinkage the fundus may be\r\ndrawn permanently toward the affected side.\r\n\r\n{1008} The cul-de-sac of the vagina is rendered broader and flatter by\r\nthe pressure of the deposit, or, when the tumor is deep enough, the\r\nvaginal surface may be rendered convex. Behind the uterus the\r\nexudation is as it were flattened antero-posteriorly, and in some\r\ncases it may be felt in the form of rigid bands between the posterior\r\nligaments which enclose the cul-de-sac of Douglas. The ante-uterine\r\ntumors have a spherical shape and depress the vagina anteriorly.\r\n\r\nTumors situated in the iliac fossa have a more or less convex form,\r\nand may be of such considerable size that the swelling may be\r\nrecognized by the eye through the abdominal walls. As the exudation\r\nbetween the broad ligaments may in these cases have been slight from\r\nthe beginning, or may have subsequently disappeared by absorption, the\r\niliac tumors have often apparently a spontaneous origin.\r\n\r\nSometimes the uterus is surrounded by exudation, and the entire pelvis\r\nappears as though it were a mould filled with a solid mass. The fornix\r\nis then often pressed downward, and irregular rounded masses are to be\r\nfelt through the vaginal walls.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of parametritic tumors through the abdominal coverings\r\nis possible when they are situated above Poupart's ligament, in the\r\nupper portion of the broad ligaments, and in the iliac fossæ.\r\n\r\nThe pain and the functional disturbances in the pelvic organs depend\r\nupon the size and situation of these inflammatory deposits. Of the\r\nfunctional troubles may be mentioned frequent and painful micturition,\r\nobstinate constipation and difficult defecation, contractures of the\r\nilio-psoas muscles when the exudation is seated beneath the sheath or\r\nbetween the muscle and the pelvic bones, disturbances of motility in\r\nthe abductor muscles, paresis of the lower extremities, and radiating\r\npains in the upper portion of the thigh and in the renal and lumbar\r\nregions, produced by pressure upon the obturator, the crural, the\r\ncutaneous, and the sciatic nerves.\r\n\r\nSo long as fever is present the exudation rarely diminishes. If\r\nabsorption takes place in one point, growth almost certainly follows\r\nin some other direction. When, however, the apyretic period is\r\nreached, the exudation, as a rule, disappears rapidly, so that often\r\nin the course of six weeks no trace of its existence remains. In a\r\nsmaller number the solid mass may persist for months or even years.\r\n\r\nAfter the fever has departed the patient usually feels well. The sleep\r\nand appetite return, the night-sweats disappear, the pulse often falls\r\nto 50 or 60 beats, and the temperature is in many cases for a time\r\nsubnormal in character.\r\n\r\nWhere the fever persists for from five to six weeks there is always a\r\nsuspicion of abscess formation. With the exception of afternoon fever\r\nand night-sweats the patient may feel very comfortable. Then the\r\nexudation becomes sensitive, the spontaneous pains recur, sleep is\r\nlost, and locomotion, defecation, and urination occasion acute\r\nsuffering. The fever becomes violent, chills announce the presence of\r\npus, and finally, about the seventieth or eightieth day, perforation\r\nof the abscess takes place. The usual seat at which the pus is\r\ndischarged is just above Poupart's ligament; next in frequency\r\nperforation takes place into the colon, and in rare instances into the\r\nbladder, the uterus, and vagina. Fortunately, of very rare occurrence\r\nis the discharge of pus into the peritoneal cavity, which is {1009}\r\nnaturally followed by acute peritonitis. Another likewise unfrequent\r\nbut most dangerous accident is the septic infection of the abscess--an\r\noccurrence referred to by Olshausen to the diffusion of intestinal\r\ngases through the walls of the tumor.\r\n\r\nIn suppuration of parametritic exudations the pus commonly forms in\r\nsmall scattered collections, and rarely gives rise to large abscesses.\r\n\r\nAlthough parametritis and perimetritis are usually found associated\r\ntogether, there are always cases in which the one form of inflammation\r\nso far predominates over the other as to justify an attempt to\r\nestablish a clinical distinction between them.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the attack, sharp pain, high fever, and tympanitic\r\ndistension of the lower abdomen are symptomatic of inflammation in the\r\npelvic peritoneum. Whether the cellular tissue is simultaneously\r\nimplicated can only be determined by a digital examination after the\r\nabdominal sensitiveness has subsided. The absence of the objective\r\nsigns of cellulitis would then contribute to prove that the case had\r\nbeen one in which the peritoneum had been in the main affected. On the\r\nother hand, moderate fever, pain elicited only on pressure, and\r\ntympanitic distension confined to the colon, coinciding with exudation\r\nbetween the folds of the broad ligament, would be indicative of a\r\nnearly pure cellulitis.\r\n\r\nA palpable exudation is by no means the necessary product of\r\nperitoneal inflammation. Indeed, in many cases, the distinctive\r\nsymptoms of the latter may be present for from four to eight days, and\r\nmay then subside without leaving a trace of its existence at the\r\npelvic brim.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of a fluid effusion by noting the change of level\r\nupon shifting the position of the patient is rarely possible, either\r\nbecause the quantity is too small or because it quickly becomes\r\nconfined by pseudo-membranous adhesions between the intestines.\r\n\r\nBandl[49] mentions as a sign of local peritonitis, sometimes\r\nnoticeable, a number of resistant points or tumors near the pelvic\r\nbrim or above one of the iliac fossæ, due to a matting together of the\r\nintestines or to their adhesion to the uterine appendages. They are\r\ndistinguished from solid tumors by their emitting a tympanitic sound\r\nupon percussion and by their changing position in consequence of an\r\naccumulation of urine in the bladder or of feces or gases in the\r\nbowels. Again, all tumors may be reckoned as intra-peritoneal which\r\nvery rapidly form behind or to the side of the uterus from enclosed\r\nexudation-products, and which at the same time rise far above the\r\nlevel of the pelvic brim. If, however, they start from the cul-de-sac\r\nof Douglas, and do not much exceed the linea terminalis, or if they\r\noccupy an iliac fossa, it becomes very difficult to decide whether\r\nthey are of intra- or extra-peritoneal origin. The peritoneal\r\nexudation, however, long remains soft and fluctuating. It arises, as a\r\nrule, behind the uterus, and does not exhibit a tendency to spread to\r\nthe sides or to the anterior or posterior pelvic walls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Handbuch der Frauenkrankheiten_, red. Von Billroth, 5te\r\nAbschnitt, p. --.]\r\n\r\nStill more difficult is it to decide as to the seat of exudations met\r\nwith beneath the abdominal walls. When diffused and continuous with a\r\npelvic deposit the diagnosis is uncertain. It is only safe to assume\r\nthe peritoneal origin of extravasations of a rounded form, of a\r\nfluctuating consistence, and when they are situated high up and are\r\ndisconnected from exudation at the pelvic brim. An opening of the\r\nabscess through the {1010} navel would indicate a peritoneal source,\r\nwhile the discharge through the abdominal parietes would point to a\r\nseat in the connective tissue.\r\n\r\nAfter the perforation of an abscess the fever and pain subside; the\r\nwound, if external, either closes in the course of one or two weeks,\r\nor fistulas form which become the source of protracted suppuration.\r\n\r\nIn psoas abscesses the exudation extends beneath the sheath of the\r\nmuscle or between the iliacus and the bone. In puerperal patients they\r\nproceed from an inflammation originating in the broad ligament. They\r\nare situated too deep to be easily palpated. The pains they occasion\r\nare referred rather to the hip or knee than to the abdomen. The\r\ncontracture of the psoas muscle furnishes a diagnostic sign which\r\ndistinguishes this form from the superficial abscesses of the iliac\r\nfossæ. The pus eventually is discharged beneath Poupart's ligament, in\r\nthe lower portion of the inguinal fossa, at some point upon the crest\r\nof the ilium, or exceptionally along the thigh. Often the discharge is\r\nmaintained for months.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of GENERAL PERITONITIS.--This form generally begins with\r\nthe usual symptoms of pelvic inflammation, but the tenderness, which\r\nat first was limited to the side of the uterus, gradually spreads over\r\nthe entire abdomen. The abdominal pain is of a tearing, lancinating,\r\nsometimes colicky character. It is increased by the slightest bodily\r\nmovement, by jarring of the bed, or even by the weight of the\r\nbed-clothes.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the peritoneal inflammation and of the\r\naccompanying exudation, the muscular walls of the bowels become\r\nparalyzed, and tympanitic distension results from the accumulation of\r\ngases. In the dependent portions of the peritoneal cavity it is often\r\npossible to demonstrate by percussion the presence of fluid exudation,\r\nthough distinct fluctuation is rarely to be made out. The size of the\r\nabdomen is due much more to the tympanites than to the amount of\r\neffusion. Sometimes the liver, with the diaphragm, is pushed by the\r\nswollen bowels to the level of the fourth or third rib, and exercises\r\nsuch a degree of compression upon the posterior portion of the lungs\r\nas to place the patient in danger of suffocation. The respirations are\r\njerky and attended with a moaning sound.\r\n\r\nThe loss of muscular power in the intestines permits the contents of\r\nthe middle portion to pass unchecked toward the duodenum, and thence,\r\nupon accidental contractions of the abdomen, they may pass to the\r\nstomach and be ejected by vomiting. The first vomited matter has a\r\ndark-green color, and that ejected afterward presents the color of\r\nintestinal matter. Constipation at the outset may be subsequently\r\nfollowed by colliquative diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe fever begins, as a rule, though not always, with an intense chill,\r\nthe temperature rises to 104°, and the pulse becomes small, hard, and\r\nresistant. Its frequency rapidly increases, varying from 120 to 160\r\nbeats to the minute. The skin is sometimes dry, sometimes dripping\r\nwith perspiration. In fatal cases, as the end approaches, the\r\ntemperature frequently falls, while the pulse becomes more rapid, the\r\nface assumes a pinched, anxious expression, sweat gathers upon the\r\nforehead, the extremities grow icy cold, and the patient dies in\r\ncollapse. The duration of peritonitis averages not more than from four\r\nto six days.\r\n\r\nIn cases of recovery the pulse improves, the vomiting ceases, and the\r\ntympanites disappears. The diffuse exudation then becomes converted\r\n{1011} into circumscribed tumors, which on palpation are felt on the\r\nside of the pelvis and extending upward to the level of the umbilicus.\r\nUpon internal examination the uterus is often found depressed by the\r\nweight of the fluid, which likewise may bulge the cul-de-sac of\r\nDouglas into the pelvic cavity. Sometimes the exudation may become\r\nencysted above the pelvis and leave the contents of the latter free.\r\nIn still other cases the uterus may become attached high up to the\r\nabdominal walls, so that the vaginal portion disappears and the os is\r\nreached with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneal exudation may, as in pelvic inflammations, become\r\nabsorbed and disappear. When, however, it is surrounded by loops of\r\nintestines it is apt to undergo purulent and septic changes, and the\r\nabscesses may then become discolored and filled with stinking gases.\r\nThe patient, whose previous improvement has been watched with delight,\r\nnow loses appetite, the pulse becomes frequent, the strength fails,\r\nand death may follow from septic fever or from rupture of abscess into\r\nthe abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nIn the pyæmic form--a still more deadly variety of peritonitis--the\r\nsymptoms differ materially from those which have been recounted. As,\r\nhowever, it constitutes only a single one of the pathological changes\r\nconnected with the poisoning of the blood through the lymphatic\r\nsystem, its consideration belongs properly to the study of the septic\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of SEPTICÆMIA LYMPHATICA.--The symptoms of\r\nblood-poisoning in the infectious diseases of childbed vary to a\r\nconsiderable extent according to the channel through which the septic\r\ngerms enter the general circulation. In the murderous epidemics which\r\nprevail in lying-in hospitals the lymphatics are, as a rule, the\r\nvessels primarily invaded. It is to this form that the cases already\r\ndescribed belong, where, with diphtheritic patches upon the\r\nutero-vaginal canal and sero-purulent oedema of the parametrium, there\r\nare associated pyæmic peritonitis and deformation of the\r\nblood-corpuscles; or where, following the migrations of the round\r\nbacteria, the serous cavities become successively involved, septic\r\nvegetations gather upon the heart, and the glomeruli of the kidneys\r\nbecome choked with micrococci. The lymphatic form of septicæmia\r\ndevelops soon after labor, and is always ushered in by a chill. The\r\ntemperature rises to 104° or even higher, and the pulse is thin and\r\nfrequent. The abdomen swells rapidly, without being especially\r\npainful. Indeed, painless distension of the intestines is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of an acute invasion of the lymphatics. Peritoneal\r\neffusion is absent in cases which run a rapid course, and is\r\ndistinctly recognizable only in a peritonitis of long continuance. The\r\neffusion is not so much due to exudation as to a transudation of serum\r\nwith which micrococci are commingled. At the same time the tongue is\r\nmoist, but slightly coated, and at times quite clean. Sometimes there\r\nis diarrhoea due to catarrh or to a diphtheritic affection of the\r\ncolon. When the bowels have been constipated the administration of a\r\npurgative may provoke discharges which it may be found difficult to\r\narrest. The skin is bathed in perspiration. At the beginning and\r\nduring the course of the disease bleeding at the nose is of not\r\ninfrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nToward the end the pulse runs up to 140 to 160 beats, while in many\r\ncases the temperature falls. Immediately after death the heat of the\r\nbody may for a short time exceed the highest point reached during\r\nlife. The {1012} respirations are superficial and jerky. In many\r\ninstances the face, the neck, and the fingers are blue from defective\r\noxygenation of the blood. At the same time the skin becomes clammy and\r\nthe extremities cold.\r\n\r\nThe sensorium, in cases which run a rapid course, is usually affected\r\nat an early period. The patients appear somnolent, are restless in\r\nbed, have light delirium, and respond only when spoken to loudly. As a\r\nrule, they make but little complaint, and, were it not for the\r\ndyspnoea, would have nothing to disturb their sense of comfort. Very\r\nfew, even as death approaches, have any idea of the danger that\r\nthreatens them. Now and then, in place of stupor, great restlessness,\r\nand even a maniacal condition, is developed. Albumen is usually found\r\nin the urine.\r\n\r\nPleurisy, so frequently associated with lymphatic septicæmia, is\r\nfrequently double, more rarely single, and begins, as a rule, with\r\nsharp pain in the side and an aggravation of the previous dyspnoea.\r\nPericarditis is less frequent, and occurs usually without symptoms\r\ntoward the close of life. The joint affections are characterized by\r\nredness and swelling, and by pain, which is sometimes so great that\r\ntouching the inflamed part suffices to arouse the patient from sopor.\r\nSometimes fluctuation is felt, but death occurs before perforation and\r\ndischarge of the pus.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent ending is death, which follows in from two to\r\ntwenty-one days, and, as a rule, between four and seven days. Recovery\r\nis, however, possible.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of SEPTICÆMIA VENOSA (phlebitis uterina, pyæmia\r\nmetastatica).--The putrid infection of a thrombus at the placental\r\nsite may take place within twenty-four to forty-eight hours after\r\nlabor. Usually, however, the approach is insidious, and the disease\r\ndevelops from an apparently insignificant endometritis or\r\nparametritis; or the patient, with the exception perhaps of a tired\r\nfeeling, of slight chilly sensations, and of profuse perspiration, may\r\nnot have been conscious of any indisposition for days preceding the\r\nattack, or even until the first getting up from childbed. The initial\r\nchill in typical cases is characterized by its violence and duration.\r\nIn some cases it may last for hours. It is accompanied and followed by\r\nhigh temperature, the febrile attack ending with profuse perspiration\r\nas in intermittent fever, with which it is apt to be confounded. The\r\nfall in temperature often assumes the form of a prolonged remission.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the pulse rises and falls with the variations in the\r\nbody heat, while in others it remains permanently above the average. A\r\nfrequent pulse is always a suspicious symptom in childbed, even where\r\nthe other symptoms are apparently normal.\r\n\r\nErratic chills announce the lodgment of emboli in distant organs. With\r\nthe formation of metastatic abscesses in the lungs and other\r\nparenchymatous organs the typical character of the disease changes. In\r\nplace of chills occurring at irregular intervals, followed by\r\nremissions and periods of apparent improvement, the fever is\r\ncontinuous, the pulse becomes small and rapid, while sopor, slight\r\ndelirium, a dry skin, a dry, brown, cracked tongue, and a moderately\r\ntympanitic abdomen, give the case the appearance of one of typhus\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis is present in hardly one-third of the cases. The abdomen\r\nis therefore flat and soft, and often is not sensitive upon pressure.\r\nIcterus, due to disintegration of the blood-corpuscles, is an ominous\r\nsymptom.\r\n\r\nDeath usually occurs in the second or third week. In the {1013}\r\ntyphus-like cases, however, it may follow the first attack speedily.\r\nRecovery is possible where the organs secondarily affected are not of\r\ntoo great importance.\r\n\r\nA combination of the lymphatic and venous forms of septicæmia is not\r\nuncommon in cases running a protracted course.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of PURE SEPTICÆMIA.--Under the title of pure septicæmia\r\nshould be placed cases in which the absorption of putrid materials\r\ninto the blood gives rise to symptoms of intense blood-poisoning\r\nwithout the development of local lesions. A common example of this\r\nform is met with in the fever which results from the presence in the\r\nuterus of decomposing coagula or portions of retained ovum, the fever\r\nsubsiding with the removal of the disturbing cause. In like manner we\r\nsometimes meet with cases of intense septic poisoning followed by\r\nspeedy death, in which the post-mortem examination reveals only\r\nchanges in the blood and softening of the parenchymatous organs. The\r\nsymptoms are often similar to those produced by the injection of\r\nputrid materials containing rod-like bacteria into the vessels of\r\nanimals. As the long bacteria do not possess the capacity of\r\nself-reproduction in the blood, to produce fatal results the quantity\r\nof putrid fluid injected must be large or be frequently repeated. This\r\nform is said not to be inoculable.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--The effects of a poisoned state of the atmosphere as a cause\r\nof puerperal fever is best observed in the so-called nosocomial\r\nmalaria of hospitals. In days gone by, before I had learned by\r\nexperience that the safe conduct of a lying-in service depends upon\r\nthe fastidious exclusion of every source of contamination, I had\r\nfrequent occasion to witness febrile outbreaks among puerperal women\r\nin the Bellevue Hospital, which were instantly arrested by the simple\r\ntransfer of the inmates of the affected ward to a wholesome locality,\r\nthough no changes were simultaneously made in either the personnel or\r\nthe utensils of the service. In these instances it seems fair to\r\nassume that the previous unhealthy condition was not due to the direct\r\ntransfer of an inoculable matter from patient to patient by the\r\nattendants, but by something residing in the air of the vacated\r\napartment. In the inquiry as to the production of this condition it\r\ncan be assumed that it is not caused by aggregation alone. The medical\r\nwards of Bellevue, always crowded, have often furnished in times of\r\nneed safe receptacles for puerperal patients. It is certainly not due\r\nto the presence of the ordinary constituents of the atmosphere. We\r\nmust therefore look for some additional element capable of unfavorably\r\naffecting the economy. What this element really is, is demonstrated by\r\na familiar clinical experience. When the disturbance produced by\r\nnosocomial malaria is not at an early stage arrested by change of\r\nlocality, the secretions of patients affected become inoculable. Then\r\nthe epidemic spreads rapidly, and assumes continuously a more and more\r\nsevere type. If during an epidemic the external genitals be carefully\r\nwatched, now and then diphtheritic patches will be noticed to form\r\nupon them. At first these patches may disappear or yield readily to\r\ntreatment. When an epidemic has assumed a pestilential form the\r\npatches, which may in isolated cases make their appearance at any time\r\nin a hospital, are rarely absent in fatal cases. The composition of\r\nthe patches tells the tale of what it is in the atmosphere which\r\naccomplishes the charnel-house work. Favoring conditions have led to\r\nthe multiplication of disease-germs {1014} in the air, and have fitted\r\nthem to become the active producers of disease.\r\n\r\nIn a patient dying in the early stages of an epidemic there may be no\r\ndiphtheritic manifestations, though the tissues and secretions are\r\nfilled with bacteria. As, however, the epidemic gains headway, the\r\nlesions of the generative apparatus, and especially of the external\r\norgans, which are most exposed to air, become covered with patches\r\nwhich swarm with micrococci. Under the conditions named it is\r\ncertainly more in accord with ordinary scientific reasoning to\r\nconclude that the micrococci play an important part in the production\r\nof puerperal fever than that the puerperal fever produces the\r\nmicrococci.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, bacteria or their spores are always present in the air,\r\nand it may be fairly asked how patients are ever spared from their\r\nperverse industry. The answer is, that the effect produced by the\r\natmosphere of a hospital is dependent partly upon the quantity, and\r\npartly upon the quality, of the suspended germs. Floating spores, when\r\nsparsely distributed, rarely possess the power of invading a healthy\r\norganism. In the inauguration of an epidemic the first patient\r\nseverely attacked is usually one whose powers of resistance are broken\r\ndown by prolonged labor, by hemorrhage, by poverty, or some other\r\ncondition leading to impaired vitality.\r\n\r\nPuerperal-fever epidemics due to contamination of the atmosphere, and\r\nnot to direct contagion, do not at once reach the maximum of\r\nintensity. At first the temperature tables indicate the prevalence of\r\nmilk fever; next follow cases closely resembling those of mild paludal\r\npoisoning; and, finally, if these warnings are unheeded and reliance\r\nis placed upon antiperiodic remedies rather than upon prompt closure\r\nof the threatened ward, the pestilence develops. In the conduct of\r\nlying-in hospitals it should never be forgotten that with the\r\nmultiplication of the septic germs the danger increases.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the quality of the agents which pervade the air\r\nwhere hospital patients are confined is an important element in the\r\ngenesis of febrile outbreaks. The bacterium termo, which causes\r\nputrefaction, is not in itself, as we have already mentioned, a source\r\nof danger. A stinking odor is not necessarily incompatible with a low\r\nmortality-rate. The importance of the common forms of bacteria,\r\naccording to Pasteur, results from the fact that by their power to\r\nconsume oxygen they pave the way for the active development of the\r\npernicious germs, nearly all of which thrive only in media in which\r\nthat element has been materially diminished. Again, there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the same germs are not[50] always equally active for\r\nevil. Gravitz claims that the ordinary varieties of aspergillus and\r\npenicillium found everywhere on the surface of the ground, on\r\nmoistened walls, on food of every variety, on decaying leaves and\r\nfruit, and whose spores are universally present in the purest air, can\r\nby a succession of cultures be gradually brought to flourish in a warm\r\nalkaline fluid, and that they then acquire the capacity to penetrate\r\nliving tissues, to proliferate in them, to excite local necroses, and\r\nto cause death in the course of three days. The resistance of\r\nmicrococci to carbolic and salicylic acids is found experimentally to\r\ndepend in a measure upon the {1015} nature of the vehicle in which\r\nthey are cultivated (Buchholz). The action of septic fluids varies too\r\nwith the age of the infusions, with the materials employed, and with\r\nthe conditions under which the poison-germs are generated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Gravitz, \"Ueber Schimmel vegetationen im thierischen\r\norganismus,\" _Virch. Arch._, vol. lxxxi, p. 355.]\r\n\r\nMicrococci multiply in hospitals when organic materials favorable to\r\ntheir growth are present in sufficient quantities. Perrin, Quenquand\r\nand others have shown that the hospital wards in Paris, especially\r\nthose upon the surgical and maternity divisions, contain an infinite\r\nnumber of vibrios, bacteria, and all the coccus forms (Charpentier).\r\nRobin[51] has demonstrated the existence of albuminoid matters in\r\nwater condensed upon vessels containing freezing mixtures and placed\r\nin overcrowded wards of hospitals. When the results of crowding become\r\nmanifest, these albuminoid matters not only impart a fetid odor and\r\nputrefy with great rapidity, but rapidly impart putrefaction to\r\nhealthy muscle and normal blood with which they are brought into\r\ncontact. Pasteur was able by the microscopic examination of the lochia\r\nfrom patients in the services of Hervieux and Lucas-Champonnière to\r\npredict, from the character of the contained organisms, an impending\r\nattack of fever in advance of the slightest symptom betokening danger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Leçons sur les Humeurs_, Paris, 1867, p. 195.]\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably the lochial discharge which makes it such a\r\ndifficult task to keep a maternity ward in a healthful condition.\r\nPutrid blood has been found to be the most favorable material for\r\nseptic experiments. It was noticeable in Bellevue Hospital that\r\nfebrile outbreaks always arose in, and were usually confined to, the\r\nward in the hospital which, by a bad arrangement, was assigned to\r\npatients for the first four or five days following confinement--_i.e._\r\nduring the period of the lochia cruenta. As puerperal fever is rare\r\nafter the fifth day, this at first sight would seem natural. But if a\r\npatient was transferred directly after confinement, during one of\r\nthese unhealthy periods, to the ward containing the patients who had\r\npassed the first five days, but had not completed the ten days, she\r\nwould escape the fever. It was always the same ward that required to\r\nbe disinfected. In a communicating apartment all the confinements took\r\nplace, and at all times, therefore, the conditions were present for\r\nloading the atmosphere with the products of decomposing blood. In the\r\nsummer months, so long as the windows were open and the air was\r\ndiluted by the continuous passage of fresh currents, the patients\r\nenjoyed immunity from nosocomial malaria. In the autumn, so soon as it\r\nbecame necessary to close the windows partially on account of the cool\r\nnights, it was not uncommon for the more trivial disturbances, such as\r\nso-called milk fever, the hospital pulse, and catarrhal affections of\r\nthe genitalia, to manifest themselves. Through the months of February,\r\nMarch, and April the mortality was usually greatest. During the winter\r\nmonths there was, as a rule, crowding of patients, insufficient\r\nventilation, stagnation of the air, and the rapid accumulation of\r\ndisease-germs. That the later winter months should prove the most\r\nperilous is in accordance not only with the theory of continuous\r\naccumulation, but with the experimental fact that weeks sometimes\r\nelapse before a decomposing substance acquires the highest degree of\r\nvirulence.\r\n\r\nApart from the nosocomial malaria of hospitals, there is reason to\r\nbelieve in the influence at times of certain general widespread\r\natmospheric {1016} states which affect the entire community. In the\r\nyear 1871 the mortality from childbed in New York was 399; in 1872,\r\n503; in 1873, 431; in 1874, 439; and in 1875, 420. Now, the excess in\r\nthe deaths for 1872 was due wholly to an increase in the cases of\r\nmetria, those from ordinary accidents remaining nearly the same as in\r\nthe preceding years. The disease certainly did not extend into the\r\ncity from the hospitals serving as foci, for the mortality at Bellevue\r\nHospital was hardly more than half the usual average. There was no\r\nespecial mortality that year from either diphtheria, erysipelas, or\r\nscarlatina, but the aggregate mortality was the largest known in the\r\nhistory of the city. There are no positive data connecting the civil\r\ndeaths from puerperal fever in 1872 with parasiticism, but the\r\nprevalence of epizoötics, of epidemic catarrhal affections, of\r\npeculiarly fatal forms of pneumonia and other diseases which are now\r\nattributed to the presence of minute organisms in the atmosphere,\r\nrenders such a source highly probable.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to say here that, though the argument is very strong in\r\nfavor of regarding the genitalia of puerperal women as the exclusive\r\npoint of entry of infectious materials into the system, it seems\r\nimpossible at the present time to make all the facts coincide with\r\nsuch a theory. I have the records of a number of cases occurring\r\nduring an epidemic of puerperal fever in which patients were either\r\nattacked with fever previous to parturition, or in whose cases the\r\nunusual length of labor, the frequency of post-partum hemorrhage, and\r\nthe imperfect contraction of the uterus immediately after confinement\r\nwere signs of some abnormal influence exercised upon the economy at an\r\nearly period of labor previous to the existence of traumatism. That\r\ndeleterious materials may find other channels for entering the system\r\nthan a wounded surface is evidenced by the cachectic condition not\r\nunfrequently produced in physicians by too assiduous attendance in\r\ndissecting-rooms and places in which _post-mortem_ examinations are\r\nconducted. One severe and rapidly fatal case of puerperal fever which\r\noccurred in Bellevue Hospital I find it impossible to attribute to any\r\nother cause than that the woman for five months previous to her\r\nconfinement served as a helper in a lying-in ward. The post-mortem\r\nexamination disclosed no special local lesions, but her symptoms were\r\nthose of intense septicæmia. French writers report instances of\r\ntoxæmic conditions developing in young midwives during puerperal-fever\r\nepidemics. While we are not prepared to go as far as Tarnier, who\r\nsays, \"It is probable that the lungs, by their extent and activity,\r\noffer conditions most favorable to absorption, and that often, if not\r\nalways, it is by them that poisoning occurs,\" it does not yet seem\r\ntime to give up the idea that under exceptional circumstances the\r\nrespiratory and the digestive tracts may allow the passage of\r\nmaterials of a septic character.\r\n\r\nAnother and frequent source of puerperal fever is by direct\r\ninoculation. Any material of a septic character, introduced into the\r\ngenital passages of a woman during or after confinement, may produce a\r\ngeneral infection of the system. But the point upon which I wish\r\nespecially to dwell is that it is possible to trace epidemics of\r\npuerperal fever directly to the carrying of puerperal poison from\r\npatient to patient through the medium of attendants. In such cases\r\nchanges in wards and the most rigid sanitary precautions avail but\r\nlittle, so long as the affected personnel is continued {1017} in\r\ncharge. Unless this fact is fully recognized, all the cleverest\r\ndevices in hospital construction will fail to prevent the occurrence\r\nof disasters. In theory, the doctrine of the contagiousness of\r\npuerperal fever has ceased to be the subject of dispute; and yet no\r\nlonger than thirty years ago it was combated as a pernicious heresy by\r\nboth Meigs and Hodge of Philadelphia, at that time regarded as the\r\nbest authorities upon obstetrical questions in this country. Hodge,\r\naddressing his students, said: \"The result of the whole discussion\r\nwill, I trust, serve not only to exalt your views of the value and\r\ndignity of our profession, but to divest your minds of the\r\noverpowering dread that you can ever become, especially in women under\r\nthe extremely interesting circumstances of gestation and parturition,\r\nthe ministers of evil--that you can ever convey, in any possible\r\nmanner, a horrible virus so destructive in its effects and so\r\nmysterious in its operations as that attributed to puerperal fever;\"\r\nand Meigs, in his letters to students, writes: \"I prefer to attribute\r\nthem to accident or to Providence, of which I can form a conception,\r\nrather than to a contagion of which I cannot form any clear idea, at\r\nleast as to this particular malady.\" Contrasted with these rhetorical\r\nutterances, in an essay published in 1843 by Prof. Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, entitled _Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence_, the\r\nopposing testimony in favor of contagion was presented with equal\r\nliterary and scientific skill. The evidence was complete and\r\nconclusive, and has exercised a most beneficial influence upon the\r\npractice of midwifery in America. With his many claims to our\r\nadmiration and esteem there is probably no title which Prof. Holmes\r\nwears with greater pride than that of pioneer in a movement that has\r\ndone so much to prevent the slaughter of innocent women and the\r\nwrecking of happy homes.\r\n\r\nThanks to changed theoretical views, physicians seem now rarely to be\r\nthe carriers of contagion. At least, in studying the records of New\r\nYork City for nine years, I find that the occurrence of two deaths\r\nfrom puerperal disease, following one another so closely as to lead to\r\nthe suspicion of inoculation, occurred to thirty physicians; a\r\nsequence of three cases occurred in the practice of three physicians:\r\none physician lost three cases, and afterward two, in succession; one\r\nphysician had once two deaths, once three deaths, and twice four\r\ndeaths, following one another; finally, a physician reported once a\r\nloss of two cases near together, then of six patients in six months\r\nand then of six patients in six weeks. Thus in the practice of more\r\nthan twelve hundred physicians in nine years I find, excluding cases\r\noccurring in hospitals, that the experience of thirty-six only lends\r\ncolor to the idea that puerperal fever is due to criminal neglect on\r\nthe part of the medical profession. Undoubtedly in many of these\r\ncases, too, the responsibility is only apparent, as when a\r\npractitioner has, for example, had the misfortune to lose in one week\r\na woman from puerperal convulsions, and another in the following week\r\nfrom placental hemorrhage. Singularly enough, not one of the sequences\r\nmentioned occurred in the practice of a physician connected with a\r\nlying-in hospital. In face of the charge that the physicians holding\r\nobstetrical appointments in public institutions are active\r\ndisseminators of puerperal fever through populous communities, I find\r\nthat the total loss from all puerperal causes, occurring in the\r\nprivate practice of ten physicians intimately associated with such\r\ninstitutions, numbered during the nine years but twenty-one cases. Of\r\nthese, thirteen were the result of ordinary {1018} accidents, and only\r\neight cases of metria proper, of which one was developed before the\r\nphysician was called in attendance; whereas a single physician,\r\nholding no hospital appointment, lost during the same time\r\ntwenty-seven cases, of which twenty-one were cases of metria.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a survival of the older ideas, chiefly to be seen\r\namong the laity, in propositions to secure absolute immunity from\r\npuerperal fever in hospital patients by confining them in wooden\r\nstructures or by conducting births under carbolic acid spray.\r\n\r\nI have been interested in endeavoring to ascertain how far experience\r\ncorresponds with Semmelweis's original theory that puerperal fever\r\nowes its origin to poisonous materials obtained from dissecting-rooms\r\nand introduced into the genital canal by the hands of physicians\r\nattending cases of labor. With this view I have made personal\r\napplication to a number of gentlemen who have engaged in midwifery\r\npractice while performing the functions of demonstrators of anatomy in\r\nour medical schools. H. B. Sands, of the College of Physicians and\r\nSurgeons, reports that in the five years during which he held the\r\noffice of demonstrator he attended about sixty cases of labor. All did\r\nwell. He lost his first patient, from childbed, a short time after he\r\nhad resigned his position in the dissecting-room. J. W. Wright, the\r\npresent professor of surgery in the Medical Department of the New York\r\nUniversity, who held for one year the position of demonstrator in the\r\nWoman's College, writes me that \"during the year I attended one\r\nhundred and four cases, including twenty-two forceps cases, two of\r\ncraniotomy, two of podalic version, and four of breech presentation.\r\nOf this number I lost two cases, one from phlegmasia dolens\r\ncomplicating uræmia, from both of which troubles the patient had\r\nsuffered during her previous labor, and one from double pneumonia, the\r\nresult of unusual exposure following confinement. Out of these one\r\nhundred and four cases I can recall but three or four cases of\r\nmetritis, and those of a mild character; I have never thought they had\r\nany special connection with my duties in the dissecting-room. I may\r\nadd that for ten years I have attended a pretty large number of\r\nconfinements each year, and that during the whole of this time I have\r\nbeen in the habit of making autopsies as occasion has offered, and of\r\nhandling and examining pathological specimens both in and out of the\r\ndissecting-room, notwithstanding which my death-record among this\r\nclass of cases has been unusually low.\" Samuel B. Ward, formerly\r\ndemonstrator at the Woman's College, at present professor of surgery\r\nin the Medical School at Albany, writes: \"While I was daily in the\r\ndissecting-room during the winter sessions of the school from 1868 to\r\n1872, I attended thirty-two confinements, of which I have notes. All\r\nof the patients recovered, nor did any of them suffer from any\r\ncomplication that could be traced to infection.\" It is familiarly\r\nknown that after Semmelweis had introduced the practice, among the\r\nphysicians attending patients at the large lying-in hospital in\r\nVienna, of washing the hands in a solution of chloride of lime, there\r\nwas a great diminution in the mortality which prevailed,\r\nnotwithstanding which G. Braun reports, however, that in 1857, in the\r\nmonth of July, in two hundred and forty-five deliveries there were\r\nseventeen deaths. The following month Klein gave orders to suspend the\r\nuse of disinfectants. By chance, in August there were only six deaths\r\nout of two {1019} hundred and fifty confinements, and in September, of\r\ntwo hundred and seventy-five patients, none died. From 1857 to 1860\r\nthe mortality was slight, though disinfectants were not used, while\r\nduring the three following years, in spite of the systematic and\r\npersistent employment of these agents, the death-rate once more\r\nassumed formidable proportions.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Braun, _Rückblicke auf die Gesundheits Verhältnisse\r\nunter den Wöchnerinnen_, u. s. w., S. 32, 33.]\r\n\r\nOf course I do not wish to underrate the importance of Semmelweis's\r\nlabors. There is no question but that it is a perilous experiment to\r\npass from the dissecting-room to a patient in labor without employing\r\nrigorous measures to disinfect the hands and all parts of the person\r\nbrought into contact with the dead body. But it is well to call\r\nattention to the fact that puerperal fever is not due to any single,\r\nsimple cause, nor can be effectually guarded against by a single\r\nprecaution; and, again, that an infectious poison does not of\r\nnecessity exist in every cadaver examined. Hausmann found that\r\ninjections into the vagina of gravid rabbits, in the latter half of\r\npregnancy, of serum from the corpse of a person who had not died of\r\nsepticæmia produced no fatal results, while rapid death resulted from\r\ninjections, under the same conditions, of pus from the abdomen of a\r\nwoman who had died from puerperal infectious disease.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: \"Untersuchungen und Versuche über die Entstehung der\r\nübertragbaren Krankheiten des Wochenbettes,\" _Beitr. zur Geb. und\r\nGynaek._, Bd. iii, Heft 3, S. 374.]\r\n\r\nBarnes and other English writers lay considerable stress upon cases of\r\npuerperal fever due neither to contagion nor to atmospheric\r\nconditions, but to the poisoning of the patient by her own secretions.\r\nThere is justification for this view in the fact that even normal\r\nlochia contain bacteria, and when inoculated into animals produce in\r\nthem affections of an ichorrhæmic and septicæmic nature. When death\r\ntakes place the tissues of animals thus treated are found to be filled\r\nwith round bacteria. Furthermore, the disease artificially produced is\r\nin itself infectious, and can be continuously propagated in other\r\nanimals. But it may be asked, \"Does not this admission cut both ways?\r\nHow is it possible, if even normal lochia possess virulent qualities,\r\nthat childbed is ever unattended by accessions of fever?\" To this we\r\ncan only answer that the reasons for immunity in ordinary cases are\r\nonly known in part. Karewski[54] and other experimental investigators\r\nhave shown that the virulence of the lochia increases proportionately\r\nto the number of days that have transpired since the birth of the\r\nchild, and that during the first three days the lochia are\r\ncomparatively harmless. Meantime, the retraction of the uterus, the\r\nclosure of the sinuses, and the formation upon the wounded surfaces of\r\nprotecting granulations, all act as natural barriers to the\r\npenetration of poison-germs. But, aside from these reasons, there is\r\nundoubtedly an unknown quantity calling for further investigation,\r\nwhich, in the absence of positive knowledge, we are content to term\r\nthe predisposition of the individual patient. The vagina after\r\nchildbirth possesses all the conditions most favorable for the\r\nproduction of putrefaction--viz. the access of air, fostering warmth,\r\nand stagnating fluids charged with dead tissue. It is probable that\r\nthe first of these needful conditions is, in normal labors, happily\r\nwanting in the uterine cavity. In these days of intra-uterine\r\nmedication it is well to {1020} bear in mind the relatively greater\r\nfrequency of infection through vaginal and cervical wounds, as\r\ncompared with that which takes place through the denuded intra-uterine\r\nsurface. The term auto-infection may, with propriety, be employed as a\r\ndistinctive appellation to designate those attacks of fever which, in\r\nthe absence of any demonstrable cause, occur in the early days of\r\nchildbed, and which there, quoad vitam, pursue a favorable course, and\r\nto cases of so-called late infection--_i.e._ where, after the fifth\r\nday, the accidental opening of a healing wound permits the tardy\r\nabsorption of poisonous secretions; but with the reserve that the\r\nprimary cause is, in point of fact, atmospheric, and the predisposing\r\ncondition the susceptibility of the individual. Cases of\r\nauto-infection are in this country extremely rare, if not unknown\r\naltogether, in salubrious or rural districts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: \"Experimentelle Untersuchungen ueber die Einwirkungen\r\npuerperaler secrete auf den thierischen organismus,\" _Zeitschr. f.\r\nGeb. und Gynaek._, Bd. vii, 2te Th., S. 331.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I have shown that in New York City the death-rate\r\nfrom puerperal fever is nearly twice as great during the six months\r\nfrom December to May, inclusive, as from June to November. The\r\ngreatest mortality occurred in February and March, comprising rather\r\nmore than one-fourth the entire amount. The smallest number of deaths\r\noccurred in September and October, in which months but one-thirteenth\r\nof the entire number took place.\r\n\r\nThat puerperal fever, in its harvest of death, does not spare the\r\nwealthy and well-to-do classes is too familiar a truth to be worthy of\r\ndiscussion. That, however, the wealthy do enjoy special immunities as\r\ncompared with the less-favored members of society, I have shown by\r\ncomparisons made between sections of the city which, though lying side\r\nby side, exhibit in a marked degree the two extremes of wealth and\r\npoverty. Thus, the mortality among the representatives of the lower\r\nsocial strata, in proportion to population, was from three to six\r\ntimes as great as that among the more fortunate classes.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS TO ZYMOTIC DISEASES.--In investigating, some years ago, the\r\nnature, causes, and prevention of puerperal fever,[55] I prepared,\r\nfrom the statistics of the Health Board of New York City, tables\r\nextending over a period of nine years to answer the inquiry as to\r\nwhether there was any relation between the frequency of deaths from\r\nscarlatina, diphtheria, and erysipelas and those from metria. Previous\r\nto their publication I was anticipated in my deductions by a paper\r\nupon the same subject by Matthews Duncan.[56] Neither Duncan nor\r\nmyself found any such relation existing between the statistical\r\nfrequency of puerperal fever and the zymotic diseases mentioned. There\r\nwas, however, nothing in our investigations to invalidate any direct\r\ntestimony which tends to show that, in individual cases, a real\r\nconnection between puerperal fever and the zymotic diseases may exist.\r\nIndeed, it seems to me to be fairly established that a poison may be\r\nconveyed from patients suffering from either of the foregoing morbid\r\nprocesses which may be absorbed by the puerperal woman, and may in her\r\ngive rise to an infectious fever possessing an intense degree of\r\nvirulence. My friend Prof. Barker has recently drawn attention to the\r\nimportant relations of intermittent fever to the puerperal state. I\r\nhave not, however, thought it advisable to complicate {1021} the\r\npresent discussion with any extended notice of his very valuable\r\nobservations. So far as malarial fever occurs unequivocally as such in\r\npuerperal women, there is no more reason for establishing a special\r\ncategory for puerperal malaria than for puerperal typhoid or puerperal\r\nsmall-pox. In the class of cases characterized by sharp chills,\r\nintense fever, irregular remissions, and profuse perspiration, which\r\npursue a pernicious course unaffected by antiperiodic remedies, the\r\nnature is extremely dubious. The same symptoms are likewise\r\ncharacteristic of certain forms of pyæmia, and I cannot learn that\r\nsuch cases are familiar in the practice of those of our physicians who\r\npractise outside of cities in districts where malarial affections are\r\nmost prevalent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Trans. of the International Med. Congress_,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: \"On the Alleged Occasional Epidemic Prevalence of\r\nPuerperal Pyæmia, or Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas,\" _Edinburgh Med.\r\nJournal_, March, 1876, p. 774.]\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.--Of the 3342 deaths from puerperal causes in New York City\r\nfrom 1868 to 1875, inclusive, 420 occurred in hospital, or one-eighth\r\nof the entire number. Of the 1947 cases of metria, about 300, or not\r\nquite one-sixth, were contributed by the hospitals. After such a\r\nshowing the first impulse would be to cry out loudly for the\r\nsuppression of the maternities. But a wiser policy suggests an inquiry\r\nas to whether the large mortality mentioned is an evil necessity. The\r\nfollowing reports will show how much may be done in the present state\r\nof our scientific knowledge to so control the conditions which favor\r\nthe generation of puerperal diseases in large hospitals as to make\r\nthem safe asylums for the needy.\r\n\r\nGoodell[57] has stated that at the Preston Retreat in 756 cases of\r\nlabor there have been but 2 deaths from septic disease. Winckel[58] of\r\nthe Lying-in Institution in Dresden reported, in 1873, 18 deaths from\r\nmetria, or 1.8 per cent., but from the 10th of January to the 7th of\r\nJuly in 570 births there was but 1 case of septic disease; in the year\r\n1872 the death-rate exceeded 5 per cent. The reduction in mortality\r\nwas no fortuitous circumstance, but was due to rigid measures for the\r\nprevention of disease. Stadfeldt[59] reduced the mortality from\r\npuerperal fever in the Maternity Hospital of Copenhagen from 1 to 37,\r\nthe proportion between the years 1865 and 1869, to 1 in 87 between the\r\nyears 1870-74. Johnston[60] reports, in the Rotunda Hospital of\r\nDublin, during the seven years of his mastership, 7860 births with 169\r\ndeaths, of which 85, or 1 in 91, were from metria. Braun von\r\nFernwald[61] in sixteen years reports 61,949 confinements in the vast\r\nMaternity Hospital of Vienna, with 825 deaths from puerperal fever, or\r\n1.3 per cent. In a visit made by me to the Vienna Maternity in 1883, I\r\nwas informed that the recent mortality, including difficult\r\noperations, had been reduced to one-half of 1 per cent.\r\nSpiegelberg[62] lost, in 901 confinements at Breslau, only 5 cases of\r\npuerperal fever. Beurmann[63] reports that in the Hôpital\r\nLariboisière, under the administration of M. Siredey, the death-rate\r\nin 1877 was 1 in 145, and in 1878, 1 in 199, confinements; in the\r\nHôpital Cochin, under the charge of M. Polaillon, the total mortality\r\nfrom 1873 to 1877 was 1 to 108.7. In 1877 there was but 1 death from\r\npuerperal causes in 807 confinements. Upon Prof. Streng's division of\r\nthe magnificent {1022} maternity in Prague, I was told that, in\r\n1882-83, in over 1100 confinements there had been no death from septic\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _On the Means employed at the Preston Retreat for the\r\nPrevention and Treatment of Puerperal Diseases_, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Berichte und Studien_, Leipsic, 1874, S. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Les maternités, leur organsation et administration_,\r\nCopenhagen, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Clinical Reports_, from 1870 to 1876, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Lehrbuch der gesammten Gynaekologie_, S. 885.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Ibid._, S. 748.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Recherches sur la mortalité des femmes en couches dans\r\nles hôpitaux_, Paris, 1879.]\r\n\r\nWhen the maternity service was transferred in 1872 from Bellevue\r\nHospital to Blackwell's Island, it became necessary to make some\r\nprovision for so-called street-cases--_i.e._ women taken suddenly in\r\nlabor without homes, and representing the extremes of penury and want.\r\nAt first they were received, in part, by the various private\r\ninstitutions of charity in New York City, but these in 1877 decided to\r\nexclude them thenceforth, on the ground that their condition at the\r\ntime of their reception was such as to endanger the lives of the\r\ninmates for whom the charities were specially provided. An old\r\nengine-house was then put in readiness by the city, and under the name\r\nof the Emergency Hospital was placed under the charge of Henry F.\r\nWalker[64] and myself. The number of confinements in the Emergency has\r\naveraged 220 annually. The death-rate from all causes has been 2 per\r\ncent., which, though large, is not an unfavorable showing when we\r\nremember that the patients all belong to the homeless class, that all\r\nwere taken in labor before their entrance, and that many of them were\r\nin a deplorable condition at the time of their admission. The\r\nhospital, too, receives a considerable number of patients annually who\r\nare sent there only after protracted, and often severe, operative\r\nmeasures have been fruitlessly attempted outside its walls.[65] The\r\nbuilding possesses, for maternity purposes, two fairly ventilated\r\nrooms. Excellent nurses are furnished by the New York Training School\r\nfor Nurses. Mr. Osborn, a liberal private citizen, has had constructed\r\nin the rear, but detached from the main house, a small pavilion,\r\nmodelled after that of Tarnier, for the reception of infectious cases.\r\nThe Commissioners of Charities have promptly responded to every call\r\nmade upon them to extend the facilities for the care of patients.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Dr. Walker has since resigned, and my present colleague\r\nis Prof. Wm. M. Polk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: From Oct., 1883, to Aug., 1884, there have been confined\r\n168 women in the hospital. Twenty were brought in from the street just\r\nafter the birth of the child. Of these 188, not one suffered from any\r\npuerperal affection. There were 2 deaths--1 from intestinal\r\nulcerations, possibly the result of the corrosive sublimate\r\nirrigations, and 1 from exhaustion. This latter patient had been\r\nthirty-six hours in labor before she was brought to the hospital, and\r\ndied four hours after admission. Under the admirable management of\r\nMiss Hart, the matron, in addition to the slight mortality, there has\r\nlikewise been almost complete absence of even trivial temperature\r\nelevations.]\r\n\r\nSurely these results do not support the idea that it is better for a\r\nwoman to be confined in a street-gutter than to enter the portals of a\r\nlying-in asylum. Goodell's experience shows that a hospital for\r\nrespectable married women may be so conducted that its inmates may\r\nenjoy absolutely a greater degree of safety than do women in their\r\nhomes surrounded by all the aids that wealth can command. Equally good\r\nresults are not to be obtained in hospitals which are open to\r\nunfortunates of every class. But there is much misapprehension and\r\nconfusion of ideas respecting the fate of these women when no\r\ncharitable provision is made for them. In Copenhagen the Maternity\r\nHospital is closed for from six to eight weeks in the summer-time.\r\nDuring this period unmarried parturient women receive pecuniary\r\nassistance from the hospital to enable them to obtain a place in which\r\nto be confined. Now, Stadfeldt reports a larger mortality among this\r\nclass than among those delivered in the hospital. Yet they are\r\nconfined at a favorable season of the year, without any communication\r\nwith the furniture, the sage-femmes, or the {1023} physicians of the\r\nhospital. As they fortunately receive nothing but money, that can\r\nhardly be suspected of communicating contagion. What their fate would\r\nbe in New York City perhaps may be judged from the following facts:\r\nExcluding cases confined in hospitals, nearly one-thirtieth of all the\r\ndeaths and one-twenty-fourth of the cases of metria between 1867 and\r\n1875 are reported by four practitioners. Ten practitioners out of\r\ntwelve hundred signed the death-certificates of one-fifteenth of the\r\nwomen dying from puerperal causes, and one-tenth of the cases of\r\nmetria. But it is not to be supposed that these deaths were all the\r\nresult of malpractice and incompetence. The true history of most of\r\nthem probably was that the doctor was engaged to attend the case of\r\nconfinement for a small fee, with the understanding that he should\r\nmake no calls subsequently, unless specially summoned by the friends\r\nof the patient. The latter, left to ignorant care or perhaps without\r\nany assistance whatever, and exposed to all the pernicious influences\r\nbred by poverty, when illness supervened probably did not call the\r\nphysician to her aid until the time for help had passed, so that in\r\nthe end his professional functions were confined to procuring the\r\nrequisite permit for burial.\r\n\r\nHumanity demands that charity should furnish places of refuge in which\r\npoor outcasts can receive assistance during the perils of\r\nchild-bearing. If we must, then, have maternities, we should make them\r\nsafe, and this can be in great measure accomplished by remembering the\r\ntwofold source of danger arising from a poisoned atmosphere and direct\r\ninoculation. A hospital must be clean, spacious, and well-ventilated,\r\nor its atmosphere will become charged with the spores of septic fungi\r\nand produce nosocomial malaria. The most rigid sanitary precautions\r\nobserved by the attendants will not prevent a badly-ventilated ward\r\nfrom becoming unwholesome, unless unoccupied wards are kept to which\r\npatients can be transferred upon the first admonition of danger.\r\nGoodell states that at the Preston Retreat the wards are used\r\ninvariably in rotation. In connection with the Maternity at Copenhagen\r\nthere are a number of small supplementary hospitals scattered through\r\nthe city, which serve as safety-valves for the central institution.\r\nArtificial methods of ventilation render the task of keeping the wards\r\nwholesome comparatively easy. They do not need, however, to be\r\ncomplicated and expensive. The good repute of the Rotunda Hospital, it\r\nseems to me, is in large measure due to the natural ventilation\r\nafforded by open fireplaces.\r\n\r\nIn the Vienna Clinic, according to C. Braun, the mortality between\r\n1834 and 1862 averaged 6 per cent., and in 1842 the enormous total of\r\n521 deaths to 3067 confinements was reached. With the introduction in\r\n1862 of what is known as Böhm's heating and ventilation system an\r\nimmediate improvement was experienced. In the sixteen years from 1863\r\nto 1878, inclusive, the total mortality has been 1.6 per cent., though\r\nin that time 5464 practitioners have received an obstetrical training\r\nin its wards. In commenting upon this change, Braun says: \"I have now\r\nfrom practical experience arrived at the knowledge of the fact that\r\nthe rapid and thorough prevention of putridity by adequate ventilation\r\nis to be regarded as a good preventive measure against puerperal\r\nfever; that it is not the number of patients in a lying-in hospital,\r\nnor yet the number of patients in a single room, but the deficient\r\ncirculation of air--a fault {1024} which may inhere to separate\r\ncompartments in the smallest maternities--which is the important\r\nfeature in the spread of puerperal fever; that puerperal women are to\r\nbe protected from childbed diseases not by isolated buildings and\r\ngardens, nor by walls, but by the permanent introduction of great\r\nquantities of pure, warm air.\" He then adds, what is in thorough\r\naccord with my own experience, \"Before new institutions are built\r\ngreater attention than heretofore should be paid to the ventilation of\r\nthe old structures, and, where this is found defective, a system\r\nshould be substituted corresponding to the scientific requirements.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872 puerperal fever destroyed 28 women of 156 who were\r\nconfined in the Bellevue Hospital. The service was then broken up, and\r\na great outcry arose against \"tainted hospitals.\" Wooden pavilions\r\nwere accordingly erected on Blackwell's Island for the reception of\r\nlying-in women. These buildings were constructed upon what is known as\r\nthe cottage plan. They were favorably situated in an airy location\r\nremote from the general hospital. They were, however, heated by large\r\niron stoves, and no means of ventilating the wards was provided,\r\nexcept by lowering the windows. In less than three months from their\r\noccupancy an epidemic of puerperal fever made it necessary to remove\r\nthe service for a time to the Charity Hospital. The same result\r\nfollowed every subsequent attempt to utilize them for maternity\r\npurposes, until, after three years' trial, it was found necessary to\r\nabandon them altogether.\r\n\r\nIn private practice it is likewise important that the lying-in room\r\nshould be provided with plenty of light and air. The physician should\r\ninsist upon the value of ventilation as a means of contributing to the\r\nspeedy recovery of childbed women. By hermetically sealing the\r\nwindows, through false fears of his patient's taking cold, he exposes\r\nher to the risk of becoming poisoned with her own exhalations.\r\n\r\nBut the early experiences of the Hôpital Cochin and the Hôpital\r\nLariboisière, costly, palace-like structures, with every appliance of\r\nart, prove that fresh air alone does not protect patients from the\r\nconsequences of inoculation.\r\n\r\nThe great improvement in the condition of maternity patients in recent\r\nyears has been due to the application of Lister's principles to\r\nobstetric practice. Complete antisepsis in the surgical sense is, of\r\ncourse, impracticable. Adequate antisepsis has, however, been proved\r\nto result from the observance of a variety of precautions which have\r\nbeen the slow outcome of experience. These, in brief, in hospitals,\r\nconsist in protecting the patient from every known form of\r\ncontamination, and in the prompt removal and isolation of every\r\npuerperal woman who manifests febrile symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn citing the examples of the Hôpital Cochin and the Hôpital\r\nLariboisière, I was led to the selection because these hospitals most\r\nstrikingly illustrate the extent of the triumph of the new doctrines.\r\nWhereas at the Lariboisière the mortality in 1854, the year of its\r\nopening, exceeded 10 per cent., as a result of the prophylactic\r\nmeasures adopted by M. Siredey the mortality was 1 to 145 in 1877, and\r\n1 to 199 in 1878. And at the Hôpital Cochin, in 1878,\r\nLucas-Champonnière, with 770 confinements, was able to report but 2\r\ndeaths from puerperal causes.\r\n\r\n{1025} As regards details, the bedsteads should be of iron and should\r\nbe frequently scrubbed with a carbolic solution; after each\r\nconfinement the palliasse upon which the woman lay should be washed in\r\nboiling water and the straw should be burned; in place of the usual\r\nrubber covering to the bed, Tarnier recommends tarred paper, which is\r\nantiseptic, and costs so little that it need be used in but a single\r\ncase; all soiled linen should be instantly removed from the ward,\r\neither to be burned or disinfected by prolonged boiling; sponges\r\nshould be banished, as, when they have once been soaked with blood,\r\nnot even carbolic acid can make them safe; nurses employed in the\r\npuerperal wards ought not to have access to cases of labor, as\r\nD'Espine and Karewski[66] have shown that the lochia of even a healthy\r\nperson on the third day will poison a rabbit; a patient attacked with\r\nfever should be immediately removed, and the nurse in attendance\r\nshould go with her. At the Emergency Hospital, with the first\r\nappearance of catarrhal affection of the genital organs or of\r\nso-called milk fever, the wards are immediately emptied and fumigated\r\nwith sulphurous acid. In spite of recent scepticism regarding the\r\nvalue of the fumes of sulphurous acid as a germicide and disinfectant,\r\nI do not hesitate to express, after long experience, my firm\r\nconviction as to their efficacy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: D'Espine, _\"Contributions à l'étude de la septicémie\r\npuerpérale,\"_ p. 18; Karewski, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nDoléris[67] formulates the indications for effective prophylaxis as\r\nfollows: 1, prevent the introduction of germs (antisepsis before\r\nconfinement); 2, paralyze their action (antisepsis after confinement);\r\n3, shut up the doors--veins, lymphatics, and Fallopian tubes\r\n(employment of means which promote uterine contraction).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _La fièvre puerpérale_, 1880, p. 303.]\r\n\r\nThe first duty of the physician is to refrain from attending a case of\r\nlabor when fresh from the presence of contagious diseases or from\r\ncontact with septic materials, whether derived from the\r\ndissecting-room or the clinic. Scepticism regarding these sources of\r\ndanger is sure in the long run to be severely punished. In a doubtful\r\ncase the least concession should consist in a full bath and a complete\r\nchange of clothing. A special coat for confinement purposes, stained\r\nwith blood and amniotic fluid, is liable to convey infection. In every\r\ncase of labor, whether in hospital or private practice, the hands and\r\nforearms should be freely bathed in a carbolic solution before making\r\na vaginal examination. A nail-brush should form a part of the ordinary\r\nobstetric equipment. Frequent examinations during labor should be\r\navoided. All instruments employed during or subsequent to confinement\r\nshould be carefully disinfected. In prolonged labors, after operation,\r\nin cases of dystocia, or where the membranes have ruptured prematurely\r\nand the foetus is dead, it is a useful precaution after delivery to\r\nwash both uterus and vagina with warm carbolized water or solution of\r\ncorrosive sublimate (1:2000). In Vienna both Spaeth and Braun after\r\ndifficult labors introduce a suppository of iodoform, 2 to 2-1/2\r\ninches in length, into the uterine cavity. The formula recommended\r\nconsists of--\r\n\r\n  Rx. Iodoformi,      20 grammes;\r\n      Gummi Arabici,\r\n      Glycerinæ,\r\n      Amyli puri,     _aa._ 2 grammes;\r\n      Ft. Bacilli,    No. iij.\r\n\r\n{1026} In their introduction the half-hand (left) should be passed to\r\nthe cervix; the iodoform bacillus should be seized by a pair of\r\npolypus forceps and pushed into the cervical canal. The hand in the\r\nvagina should then be used to shove the suppository upward past the\r\ninternal os. No symptoms of poisoning from the iodoform have been\r\nobserved. The disinfection is complete and prolonged. In hospitals the\r\nwoman should be bathed before entering the lying-in ward, and the\r\nvagina should in all cases be disinfected with carbolic acid or\r\ncorrosive sublimate both before and immediately after labor. The\r\nconduct of labor under carbolic acid spray is commended by Fancourt\r\nBarnes. Doléris advises the application of a compress soaked in\r\ncarbolic fluid to the external genitals during the progress of labor.\r\nTarnier advises dressing the vulva, so soon as the head begins to\r\nemerge, with a pledget soaked in carbolized oil (1:10). With the\r\nrecession of the head during the interval between pains a portion of\r\nthe oil is carried upward into the vagina.\r\n\r\nIn the puerperal period the warm carbolized douche stimulates uterine\r\nretraction and promotes the rapid healing of wounds in the vaginal\r\ncanal; in hospital practice it possesses the additional advantage of\r\npreventing the accumulation of putrid albuminoid matters in the air.\r\nIn private practice the patient should employ a new syringe; in\r\nhospitals every woman should be supplied with a glass tube to be\r\nattached to the irrigator. When not in use these tubes should be\r\nimmersed in carbolic acid. The stream injected into the vagina should\r\nbe continuous, like that furnished by the fountain syringe. With my\r\nhospital patients, in place of cloths to the vulva I have been in the\r\nhabit of using oakum. By soaking the latter in a solution of carbolic\r\nacid the vulva is surrounded by an antiseptic atmosphere.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: I know that of late there has been a strong reaction\r\nagainst the use of vaginal injections in normal childbed, but\r\npersonally I have experienced none of the disagreeable effects\r\nascribed to them. Indeed, both my hospital and private patients alike\r\nspeak of them as soothing and grateful. I therefore have had no ground\r\nto discontinue them. That they are indispensable I do not claim. They\r\nare no longer used in Vienna, in Prague, nor in the New York\r\nMaternity, and yet, none the less, their results have since been in\r\nthe highest degree satisfactory. At these institutions, however,\r\nvaginal disinfection is vigorously resorted to during and immediately\r\nsubsequent to labor, and during childbed some form of antiseptic pad\r\nover the vulva is employed.]\r\n\r\nPedantic as these directions may seem, they are justified by\r\nexperience, and the carrying out of the details given easily becomes a\r\nmatter of habit. That by such precautions puerperal fever is destined\r\nto be erased from the list of dangerous diseases attacking the woman\r\nin childbed is saying more than is warranted. Nevertheless, it is true\r\nthat a physician ought never to lose the sense of personal\r\nresponsibility for its occurrence. Indeed, puerperal fever ought to be\r\nregarded as a preventable disease, and an attack as the evidence that\r\nsome source of danger has been overlooked, though, owing to the\r\nimperfection of our knowledge, it may easily happen that even with the\r\nkeenest scrutiny the precise cause in an individual case may escape\r\ndetection.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Since the above was written Dr. Garrigues has furnished\r\na most extraordinary example of the efficacy of the antiseptic\r\ntreatment at the New York Maternity Hospital. From the years 1875 to\r\n1882, inclusive, the number of confinements was 2827; the deaths 116,\r\nor a little over 4 per cent. The highest percentage was reached in\r\n1877--viz. 6.67; the lowest in 1881, when it fell to 2.36. In 1883, of\r\n345 women confined, 30 died. In September of that year there were 9\r\ndeaths, and of 5 puerperæ who were seriously ill, 1 died later. At\r\nthis time he introduced a series of reforms of which the following,\r\nomitting details, gives the essentials: Wards fumigated with\r\nsulphurous acid fumes, and the floors and furniture washed with a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate (1:1000). Every patient, on entering\r\nthe lying-in ward after the bath, had her abdomen, buttocks, genitals,\r\nand thighs washed with sublimate solution (1:2000). During labor\r\nvagina irrigated with latter solution. In prolonged labors irrigation\r\nrepeated every three hours. Great care of hands on part of doctor and\r\nnurses. Glycerine and corrosive sublimate (1:1000) used for\r\nlubricating fingers before making internal examinations. Antiseptic\r\npad applied to the head during its egress, and to the vulva until the\r\nsecondines had been expelled. Absorbent cotton covered with netting\r\nsoaked in corrosive sublimate solution applied to external genitals\r\nduring childbed period. This latter applied and removed with the same\r\ncare as in dressing a wound after a capital operation. Irrigation,\r\nfirst of the vagina and afterward of the uterus, immediately after\r\nlabor in cases where the hand or instruments had been passed into the\r\nuterine cavity.\r\n\r\nWhen the details of this treatment were first published by Garrigues,\r\nmany took a humorous view of it, but mark the result: In the following\r\n162 confinements there were no deaths, and from October to July,\r\ninclusive, of the present year, of 409 patients confined, though many\r\noperations were performed, 5 died; but of these, 3 only were from\r\nseptic causes, and they, Garrigues believes, were the result of the\r\nneglect of certain of the prescribed details.]\r\n\r\n{1027} Before terminating this section upon the prophylaxis of\r\npuerperal fever, I take great satisfaction in furnishing from\r\nTarnier's recent treatise the following description, by Pinard, of the\r\ningenious pavilion designed by Tarnier to make it possible to secure\r\nfor hospital patients, at the minimum expense, the benefits of\r\nisolation, and to provide for each room in the pavilion all the\r\nconditions favorable to rapid and complete disinfection.\r\n\r\nThe pavilions are two-storied and of a rectangular shape, twenty-four\r\nfeet in width by forty-six feet in length. The front and rear face to\r\nthe north and south, the ends to the east and west. Two main\r\npartitions divide the interior into three divisions. Each end division\r\nis subdivided by a central partition into two chambers, so that each\r\nstory has five compartments--a central one for the attendants, and\r\nfour at the four corners destined for the reception of patients. On\r\nthe ground floor the central compartment consists of a vestibule\r\nfacing to the north, and an office facing to the south. On the former\r\nare placed the staircase, the water-closet, and a reception-closet. In\r\naddition to the main entrance there are three interior doors--one\r\nleading to the water-closet, one to the closet, and one to the office.\r\nThe latter, for the occupation of the person on duty, contains a\r\nheater, a portable bath, a table, chairs, and wardrobe. Two windows\r\nface the south. The office has two doors, one opening into the\r\nvestibule, and the other, in the opposite side, opens directly\r\noutward. The four corner rooms for patients have each a door and a\r\nwindow, the latter looking from the end of the partition and reaching\r\nto the floor, and the former opening out from the façade. These four\r\nrooms are therefore not only independent of one another, but have no\r\ncommunication with the vestibule or the central office. On the second\r\nfloor the arrangement is similar, except that the rooms open upon a\r\nbalcony, by means of which communication from the outside is rendered\r\npossible. Upon each façade a glazed screen furnishes shelter in rainy\r\nweather. The screen extends to the roof, but is not in direct contact\r\nwith the walls, a space being left for a current of air. The eight\r\nrooms for patients, four on each story, are severally fourteen feet\r\nlong, eleven and a half feet wide, and ten feet high. Below, the\r\nfloors are of asphaltum; above, of flags or slates. The walls and\r\nceilings are stuccoed and covered with oil paint. The corners are\r\nrounded to prevent the accumulation of dust. To facilitate {1028}\r\nwashing, the floors slant toward a gutter communicating by means of a\r\npipe with the sewer. In each room panes of glass enable patients and\r\nthe office attendant to see one another, so that surveillance is\r\nsecured without sacrificing the principle of isolation. The furniture\r\nof the rooms consists of an iron bedstead with metallic springs. The\r\npillow, bolster, and palliasse are stuffed with straw. In addition,\r\neach room is provided with a night table, a round table, a chair, a\r\nstool, and a crib--all of iron. A bell-rope at the bedside, the wire\r\nof which passes to the office by the outside of the building, enables\r\nthe patient to summon assistance. Each room likewise contains a\r\nwashstand, with faucets for hot and cold water, the latter supplied\r\nfrom a cistern on the roof, the former from the office heater. The\r\npatients remain in the rooms where they are confined until they are\r\ndischarged. When this takes place the chamber is aired, the furniture\r\nis removed and washed with care, the straw is burned, and the walls\r\nare washed with an abundant supply of water. If a patient is taken\r\nill, she is carefully isolated, and has assigned to her her own\r\nespecial attendant and physician, who do not come into contact with\r\nother puerperal patients.\r\n\r\nThat the plans of construction in the Tarnier pavilions would require\r\nsome modification to adapt them to the rigor of our winters seems\r\nprobable, but the principles which they illustrate are sufficiently\r\nvindicated by the results so far reported--viz. 6 deaths in 1062\r\nconfinements, whereas in the old Maternity the death-rate, formerly\r\namounting to 5 per cent., still aggregates 2 to the 100.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--When the septic germs characteristic of putrid infection\r\nhave once entered the blood, they are beyond the reach of the\r\nphysician. Except, however, in cases of acute septicæmia, where the\r\nquantity of poison introduced at the outset is excessive, the patient\r\nrallies from the immediate shock, and, provided no fresh pyrogenic\r\nmaterial finds its way into the system, recovery is to be anticipated.\r\nThe indications for treatment are, therefore, to neutralize the\r\npuerperal poison at the point of production, in order to prevent its\r\ncausing further mischief, and to adopt measures calculated to enable\r\nthe patient to tolerate its presence, when once absorbed, until it is\r\neither eliminated or loses its harmful properties.\r\n\r\nToward the fulfilment of the first indication it is to be recommended\r\nthat in every case of fever of puerperal origin the vagina be cleansed\r\nwith a 2 to 3 per cent. solution of carbolic acid or corrosive\r\nsublimate (1:3000) every four to six hours. The douche in itself is\r\nabsolutely harmless. In most cases the infection starts from the\r\nwounds of the vagina and of the cervix. Then, too, the tendency of the\r\nsecretions to stagnate in the vaginal cul-de-sac, bathing as they do\r\nthe cervical portion, is a prolific source of septic trouble. In all\r\nbut the mildest cases the vaginal orifice should be examined with\r\nreference to the existence of puerperal ulcers. All necrotic patches\r\nshould be touched with hydrochloric acid, with a 10 per cent. solution\r\nof carbolic acid, with iodoform, or, what I personally prefer, a\r\nmixture composed of equal parts of the solution of the persulphate of\r\niron and the compound tincture of iodine. The latter acts as a\r\npowerful antiseptic, while the former, by corrugating the tissues,\r\ncloses the lymphatics and shuts up the portals through which the\r\nseptic germs penetrate into the system.\r\n\r\n{1029} Intra-uterine injections should be resorted to with extreme\r\ncircumspection. They are not indicated by a simple rise of\r\ntemperature. A very large proportion of the febrile attacks which\r\noccur in childbed run an absolutely favorable course. Unless the\r\ninfection--and this is not the rule, but the exception--proceeds from\r\nthe uterine cavity, they are unnecessary. In circumscribed\r\ninflammations, where the morbific poison loses its virulence at a\r\nshort distance from the puerperal lesion, they are often injurious. It\r\nis difficult, if not impossible, to so conduct them as to avoid\r\nopening up afresh recent granulating wounds. Yet the practice of local\r\ndisinfection is warmly advocated by Fritsch, Schüller, Langenbuch, and\r\nSchroeder as a prophylactic against puerperal affections. On the other\r\nhand, Braun von Fernwald, with his vast opportunities for judging\r\nobstetrical questions, writes with reference to this: \"We must protest\r\nagainst injections made by physicians into the uterine cavity. Such\r\nmeddlesomeness is more likely to do harm than good.\" This corresponds\r\nwith my own experience. In theory, the proposition to treat the uterus\r\nas one would any other pus-secreting cavity seems rational, but I have\r\nfound that every attempt to carry the theory to its logical conclusion\r\nin hospital practice has been followed by a rise in the puerperal\r\ndeath-rate. Runge reports an epidemic of puerperal fever in\r\nGusserrow's clinic brought about by the employment of intra-uterine\r\nirrigations, during which the mortality rose to 3.8 per cent. With the\r\nabolition of the irrigations the mortality sank to .39 per cent. In\r\n1880, Fischel[70] introduced the so-called permanent irrigations into\r\nthe Prague maternity. Of 880 patients, 9 died of sepsis. The\r\nirrigations were then prohibited. The following year, of 933 patients,\r\nonly 2 died from the same cause, and in 1882, of 521 patients, there\r\nwere no deaths from sepsis. Fehling, who limited the use of\r\nintra-uterine injections to special momentary indications, reported,\r\nin 1880, 415 confinements without a single death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: \"Zur Therapie der Puerperalen Sepsis,\" _Arch. f.\r\nGynaek._, vol. xx. p. 41.]\r\n\r\nAmong the accidents which have been referred to the use of injections\r\nare convulsions, shock, and carbolic-acid or corrosive-sublimate\r\npoisoning; but the chief danger lies in the possibility of conveying\r\nthe infectious materials from the vagina to the previously normal\r\nuterus. There seems to be no question as to the superior effectiveness\r\nof corrosive sublimate as a germicide. It not only acts more rapidly\r\nthan carbolic acid, but its action is more permanent. In the usual\r\nproportion of 1:2000 it is apt, when repeated frequently as a vaginal\r\ndouche, to corrugate the vagina and cervix. When used for\r\nintra-uterine irrigation great pains should be taken that no portion\r\nof the fluid remain behind in the uterine cavity. Since its\r\nintroduction into the Emergency Hospital there has been one death from\r\nulceration in the colon, which possibly was attributable to its use.\r\nIt is to be hoped the claim that corrosive sublimate is an efficient\r\nantiseptic in the proportion of 1:10,000 may prove well founded.\r\n\r\nIn pressing the necessity of caution and discrimination, I have not,\r\nhowever, intended to discourage the employment of intra-uterine\r\nantisepsis in cases where it is strictly indicated. Thus, it would be\r\nfolly, in a fever due to the decomposition of placental débris, of\r\nshreds of decidua, of strips of membrane, or of retained coagula, or\r\nin diphtheritis of the mucous membrane, to treat the general symptoms\r\nand neglect {1030} the local cause of difficulty. In a specific case\r\nit may prove difficult to decide as to the correct course to pursue.\r\nIn general it may be stated that it is proper to wash out the entire\r\nlength of the genital canal when fever follows prolonged operations\r\nconducted within the uterine cavity or the birth of a dead foetus, and\r\nin cases of fever associated with a fetid discharge which persists in\r\nspite of the vaginal douche, with the presence of recognizable\r\nportions of the ovum or its dependencies in the lochia, with the\r\nrepeated discharge of decomposed coagula, or with a large, flabby\r\nuterus. It will, however, be seen that with proper disinfection during\r\nand immediately after labor, the occasions for late intra-uterine\r\ninjections are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nThe operation of cleansing the uterus should be conducted with the\r\nmost scrupulous care. The syringe employed should produce a continuous\r\nand not an interrupted stream, and all air should be expelled from the\r\npipe. The tube to be passed through the cervix should be of glass, of\r\nthe size of the little finger, and bent somewhat to conform to the\r\npelvic curve. The vagina should first be subjected to a thorough\r\ndisinfection, by way of precaution against conveying septic materials\r\ninto the uterus. The introduction of the tube should be made with the\r\nguidance of two fingers passed through the external os. But slight\r\nforce is requisite to reach the internal os. It is neither necessary\r\nnor desirable to push the tube to the fundus. The fluid injected\r\nshould be tepid, and, if carbolic acid is used, of the strength of two\r\nor three drachms to the pint; if corrosive sublimate is employed, the\r\nstrength should not exceed 1:3000. It should be introduced very\r\nslowly, and pains should be taken to ensure its unimpeded escape,\r\nwhich can usually be accomplished by pressing the anterior wall of the\r\ncervix forward by means of the glass tube. Langenbuch recommends\r\nsecuring permanent drainage by leaving a bit of rubber tubing in the\r\ncervical canal--a plan concerning the merits of which I am not able to\r\nspeak from experience. The tube is said to be well tolerated, and to\r\npossess the advantage of enabling subsequent injections to be\r\nperformed without disturbing the patient.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the results of intra-uterine treatment are very\r\nstriking. Often the temperature falls notably within an hour or two of\r\nthe operation. This result is, however, rarely permanent. Usually the\r\nfever recurs, and the operation has to be repeated. The patient should\r\nbe carefully watched, and with the first sign of returning danger the\r\ninjection should be repeated. Two or three injections may thus be\r\ncalled for in twenty-four hours, and they may require to be continued\r\nfor a week. Still, by the means indicated a certain pretty large\r\nproportion of women seemingly destined to destruction in the end make\r\nfavorable recoveries.[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: The admirable monograph of Dr. T. G. Thomas, entitled\r\n_The Prevention and Treatment of Puerperal Fever_, has already done\r\nmuch good in calling the attention of the profession at large to the\r\npractice of local disinfection. His experience, however, based upon a\r\nvery large consulting practice, has perhaps been of a kind to furnish\r\nhim with an undue proportion of puerperal cases calling for\r\nintra-uterine treatment. With increasing care in the management of\r\nlabor and of the birth of the child there seems reason to hope that\r\nthe necessity for the treatment he so eloquently advocates may, in the\r\nnear future, disappear entirely.]\r\n\r\nEhrendorfer[72] relates a case of septic endometritis and erysipelas\r\n{1031} starting from the genital organs, in Spaeth's Clinic, where,\r\nafter seven days of ineffective uterine irrigations, two bacilli,\r\ncontaining together ten grains of iodoform, were introduced into the\r\nuterus. The washings with carbolic acid were then stopped. On the next\r\nday the discharge was diminished and the odor was less marked. On the\r\nfourth day two new iodoform bacilli were introduced. The patient, in\r\nspite of the fact that the erysipelas spread over nearly the entire\r\nbody, eventually recovered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: \"Ueber die Verwendung der Jodoform staebchen bei der\r\nintrauterinen nach behandlung im Wochenbette,\" _Arch. f. Gynaek._,\r\nvol. xxii. S. 88.]\r\n\r\nOf the symptoms, the first in order which calls for treatment is\r\nusually the peritoneal pain. It is, as we have seen, commonly of a\r\nlancinating character, and is associated with hurried breathing and\r\nextreme frequency of the pulse. So soon as the pain is once fairly\r\nunder control the violence of the onset begins to abate. It should be\r\nmet, therefore, by the hypodermic injection of from one-sixth to\r\none-third grain of morphia in solution. The anodyne action should be\r\nmaintained by doses administered by the mouth in quantities and at\r\nintervals suited to the severity of the case. The most important\r\nobject to be secured is freedom from spontaneous pain. It is,\r\nmoreover, good practice to push the opiate until pain elicited by\r\npressure is likewise controlled, provided it can be accomplished\r\nwithout producing narcosis. In susceptible patients and in localized\r\ninflammations the quantity required may not be very great, while in\r\nacute general peritonitis the tolerance of the drug exhibited by\r\npuerperal women is sometimes extraordinary. Thus, a patient of Alonzo\r\nClark took the equivalent of 934 grains of opium in four days; a\r\npatient of Fordyce Barker 13,969 drops of Magendie's solution in\r\neleven days; and one of my own, at the Maternity, the equivalent of\r\nover 1700 grains of opium in seven days.[73] In this latter instance\r\nthe patient was to all appearance moribund when the treatment was\r\nbegun. Thus, the features were pinched, the face was drawn, the pupils\r\nwere dilated, the finger-tips were blue and cold, the respirations\r\nwere rapid, and the pulse was scarcely perceptible. In this condition\r\nthe large doses of opium did not produce narcosis, but were followed\r\nby restoration of the circulation, by normal breathing, and by the\r\ndisappearance of the symptoms of shock. Any attempt to relax the\r\ntreatment was at once succeeded by a recurrence of the alarming\r\nsymptoms. At the expiration of the disease the opium was discontinued\r\nabruptly without detriment to the patient.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: The details of this case have been reported in the _Am.\r\nJour. of Obst._, Oct., 1880, p. 864, by Dr. F. M. Welles, who\r\nconducted the administration of the opium.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to cases of acute peritonitis an extreme susceptibility to\r\nopium is often observed in the pyæmic variety. Here opiates seem to me\r\nrarely to do good. They do not hinder the migrations of the round\r\nbacteria, there is rarely pain to relieve, and I have sometimes\r\nthought that their administration was simply the addition of a second\r\npoison to the one which already was overwhelming the nervous system.\r\n\r\nIn pelvic peritonitis, in the course of forty-eight hours plastic\r\nexudation is thrown out and the pain to a great extent subsides. From\r\nthis time very moderate doses of opium, as a rule, are needed to make\r\nthe patient comfortable.\r\n\r\nIn France leeches applied to the abdomen are much used as a means of\r\nrelieving peritoneal sensitiveness. That they do this is beyond\r\nquestion. {1032} Their disuse in this country is due probably more to\r\npopular prejudice than to their inefficacy.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of an attack a turpentine stupe to the abdomen is a\r\nsource of comfort to many women, while the sharp counter-irritation\r\nexercises possibly a favorable influence upon the course of the\r\ndisease. At a later period I commonly employ flannels wrung out in\r\nwater and covered with oil-silk to prevent speedy evaporation. It is\r\nan old experience that in the beginning of a puerperal fever the\r\nprovocation of loose stools by purgatives is frequently followed by a\r\nfall in the temperature and a great improvement in the patient's\r\ncondition. The result, however, is far from uniform, as in other cases\r\nthese artificial diarrhoeas have a tendency to aggravate the\r\nperitoneal symptoms. Owing to this uncertainty in their action,\r\npurgative remedies should be administered with caution, not from any\r\ntheory as to their eliminative powers, but because of the ascertained\r\nexistence of fecal accumulation. In pelvic inflammations castor oil in\r\ntwo- or three-tablespoonful doses, or five to ten grains of calomel\r\nrubbed up with twenty grains of bicarbonate of sodium, as recommended\r\nby Barker, may be given when thus indicated. After the bowels have\r\nonce been freed, however, the purgative should not be repeated. In\r\ncases of intense local inflammation and in general peritonitis enemata\r\nshould alone be employed for the removal of constipation.\r\n\r\nEvery increase of body-heat is associated with rapid tissue-waste,\r\nwith enfeebled heart-action and with exhaustion of the nerve-centres.\r\nSince the modern recognition of the deleterious effects of high\r\ntemperatures per se, antipyretic remedies in place of the old-time\r\ncardiac sedatives have come to play the leading rôle in the treatment\r\nof fevers.\r\n\r\nOf internal antipyretic agents quinia enjoys a deservedly high repute.\r\nIn the remitting forms of fever it may be administered in five-grain\r\ndoses at intervals of four to six hours. Given thus in medium doses,\r\nit moderates the fever, diminishes the sweating, and in most patients\r\nlessens gastric and intestinal disturbances. In continued fevers it\r\nshould, on the contrary, be given in a single dose large enough to\r\nprocure a distinct remission. By making a break in the febrile\r\nsymptoms, if only of a few hours' duration, a retardation of the\r\ndestructive processes is accomplished. At the first administration\r\ntwenty to thirty grains may be given. In favorable cases the\r\ntemperature falls in the course of a few hours below 101°. When the\r\nhigh temperature is only temporarily held in check, at the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours, if all symptoms of cinchonism have disappeared, the\r\nsame dose should be repeated. If the doses mentioned, given in the\r\nmanner prescribed, produce no perceptible effect upon the fever, their\r\ncontinuance may be regarded as unnecessary.\r\n\r\nC. Braun and Richter speak favorably of the action of salicylate of\r\nsodium.[74] It possesses antipyretic properties, though in a less\r\ndegree than quinia. It is, however, rapidly absorbed, circulates\r\nthrough all the parenchymatous organs, and finally is discharged\r\nunchanged in the urine. It is said by Binz, in small doses, to hinder\r\nthe action of the disease-producing ferments, while it leaves\r\nuntouched the normal ferments of the organism. It is of special\r\nservice where quinia is not well tolerated, or when given fifteen to\r\ntwenty grains at a time every four to six hours as {1033} an adjuvant\r\nto large single doses of quinia. The remedy should be continued until\r\nall traces of febrile disturbance have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Richter, \"Ueber intrauterine Injectionen,\" etc.,\r\n_Zeitschr. für Geburtsk. und Gynaek._, Bd. ii. Heft 1, p. 146.]\r\n\r\nA more powerful remedy than salicylic acid, where quinia has failed,\r\nis the Warburg's tincture. Some patients find, however, that it is\r\nsomewhat difficult to retain upon the stomach.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, owing to the encomiums of Fordyce Barker,[75] the\r\ntincture of veratrum viride was in great favor in puerperal fever as a\r\nmeans of reducing the excited pulse of inflammation. The plan\r\nrecommended was to administer five drops hourly, in conjunction\r\nusually with morphia, until the pulse was brought down to 70 or 80\r\nbeats to the minute. If the pulse had once been reduced, then three,\r\ntwo, or one drop hourly would be found sufficient to control it.\r\nVomiting and collapse from its use were no cause for alarm, as they\r\nwere temporary symptoms, and were followed by a fall of the pulse to\r\n30 or 40 a minute, which was rather of favorable prognostic\r\nsignificance. In the rapid pulse of exhaustion, however, veratrum\r\nshould not be given. Since the introduction of the thermometer into\r\npractice the reduction of the pulse by veratrum has been found to be\r\nassociated with a fall in the temperature of the body. Of late,\r\nhowever, veratrum has gone rather out of vogue, not because it is not\r\na very effective agent, but because its administration is an art to be\r\nacquired, and cannot safely be entrusted to an unskilled assistant.\r\nThen, too, in the last ten years there has grown up a better\r\nacquaintance with less dangerous remedies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _The Puerperal Diseases_, p. 347.]\r\n\r\nBraun recommends in severe cases, where quinia alone is without\r\neffect, to give in addition from twelve to twenty-four grains of\r\ndigitalis in infusion per diem until its specific action is produced.\r\nUnlike veratrum, digitalis effects a permanent slowing of the heart.\r\nBy prolonging the cardiac diastole and contracting the arterioles it\r\nallows the left ventricle to fill, restores the arterial tension,\r\ndiminishes correspondingly the intravenous pressure, and promotes\r\nabsorption. Its tendency to produce gastric disturbances and the\r\ndistrust felt as to its safety have prevented its becoming popular in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nAlcohol as an adjuvant to treatment is indicated in all cases, whether\r\nquinia or salicylic acid or veratrum be simultaneously employed. It\r\nstimulates and sustains the heart, it retards tissue-waste, and is in\r\nitself an antipyretic of no mean value. Usually I give it in\r\nconjunction with quinia, one or two teaspoonfuls hourly of either\r\nwhiskey, rum, or brandy, in accordance with the recommendation of\r\nBreisky.[76] But many years before I had learned from my friend Prof.\r\nBarker that the specific influence of veratrum was in many cases not\r\nobtained until the use of alcohol was combined with it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Ueber Alcohol und Chinin-behandlung_, Bern, 1875.]\r\n\r\nThe antipyretic action of drugs is probably due for the most part to\r\nsome direct influence they exert upon the oxygenation of the tissues.\r\nOf course the less the fire the less the heat. It is well, however, to\r\nsupport their internal administration by the external employment of\r\ncold. Cold owes its effect in fevers partly to the abstraction of heat\r\nfrom the body-surface, and in a still more important degree to the\r\nimpression which it produces upon the nervous system. In healthy\r\npersons the action of cold is to increase the consumption of oxygen\r\nand the production of carbonic {1034} acid. The additional heat thus\r\ngenerated renders it possible to sustain the vicissitudes of climate.\r\nIn fevers the primary effect of cold is similar in character. Its main\r\ntherapeutical action is derived from its secondary influence upon the\r\nnerve-centre which regulates the body-heat. If the cold employed be\r\nsufficiently intense or sufficiently prolonged, there follows, not\r\nalways immediately, but in the course of an hour or two, a marked\r\nlowering of the temperature, which can only be accounted for by\r\nassuming an indirect influence exerted through the sympathetic nerve\r\nand the medulla oblongata. This peculiarity renders the external\r\napplication of cold a most valuable addition to the therapeutical\r\nresources available in fevers.\r\n\r\nIn cases of moderate severity frequently sponging the patient with\r\ncold water will be found to be a grateful practice. An ice-cap to the\r\nhead, where the blood lies near the surface, will often affect the\r\nentire temperature of the body. From immemorial times it has been\r\nemployed to control delirium and promote sleep. An ice-bag placed over\r\nthe inguinal region is locally beneficial to deep-seated pelvic\r\ninflammations, and, according to Braun, is capable of effecting a\r\nrapid fall of temperature. Ice-cold drinks should be freely allowed.\r\n\r\nSchroeder recommends a permanent stream of cold water in the uterine\r\ncavity by means of a large irrigator and a drainage-tube; others\r\nadvise cold rectal injections maintained for long periods by the aid\r\nof a tube with a double current.\r\n\r\nIn fevers of great violence the systematic application of cold by\r\nmeans of baths or the wet pack is capable in some cases of rendering\r\nimportant service. The temperature of the bath should range from 70°\r\nto 80°. Its duration should not exceed ten minutes. The patient\r\nshould, when removed to the bed, be wrapped in a sheet without drying,\r\nand should be comfortably covered. In employing the wet pack two beds\r\nshould be placed side by side. The body and thighs of the patient\r\nshould be wrapped in a sheet wrung out in cold water, and be allowed\r\nto remain in the pack from ten to twenty minutes. As the sheet becomes\r\nheated the patient should be placed in a fresh one upon the second\r\nbed, and the transfers should be continued until the desired fall of\r\ntemperature is effected. Braun claims that four packs are equivalent\r\nin action to one full bath.\r\n\r\nBoth these methods are, however, open to the objection that they\r\ncannot be carried out without considerable disturbance of the\r\npatient--a point of no small importance in cases of peritonitis. G. B.\r\nKibbie has invented a fever-cot which obviates the ordinary\r\ndifficulties of this mode of treatment. The cot is covered with \"a\r\nstrong, elastic cotton netting, manufactured for the purpose, through\r\nwhich water readily passes to the bottom below, which is of rubber\r\ncloth so adjusted as to convey it to a vessel at the foot.\" T. G.\r\nThomas,[77] who has employed this apparatus extensively to reduce high\r\ntemperatures after ovariotomies, explains as follows the modus\r\noperandi: \"Upon this cot a folded blanket is laid, so as to protect\r\nthe patient's body from cutting by the cords of the netting, and at\r\none end is placed a pillow covered with india-rubber cloth, and a\r\nfolded sheet is laid across the middle of the cot about two-thirds of\r\nits extent. Upon this the patient is now laid; her {1035} clothing is\r\nlifted up to the armpits, and the body enveloped by the folded sheet,\r\nwhich extends from the axillæ to a little below the trochanters. The\r\nlegs are covered by flannel drawers and the feet by warm woollen\r\nstockings, and against the soles of the latter bottles of warm water\r\nare placed. Two blankets are then placed over her, and the application\r\nof water is made. Turning the blankets down below the pelvis, the\r\nphysician now takes a large pitcher of water, at from 75° to 80°, and\r\npours it gently over the sheet. This it saturates, and then,\r\npercolating the network, it is caught by the india-rubber apron\r\nbeneath, and, running down the gutter formed by this, is received in a\r\ntub placed at its extremity for that purpose. Water at higher or lower\r\ndegrees of heat than this may be used. As a rule, it is better to\r\nbegin with a high temperature, 85°, or even 90°, and gradually\r\ndiminish it. The patient now lies in a thoroughly soaked sheet, with\r\nwarm bottles to her feet, and is covered up carefully with dry\r\nblankets. Neither the portion of the thorax above the shoulders nor\r\nthe inferior extremities are wet at all. The water is applied only to\r\nthe trunk. The first effect of the affusion is often to elevate the\r\ntemperature--a fact noticed by Currie himself--but the next affusion,\r\npractised at the end of an hour, pretty surely brings it down. It is\r\nbetter to pour water at a moderate degree of coldness over the surface\r\nfor ten or fifteen minutes than to pour a colder fluid for a shorter\r\ntime. The water slowly poured robs the body of heat more surely than\r\nwhen used in the other way. The water collected in the tub at the foot\r\nof the bed, having passed over the body, is usually 8° or 10° warmer\r\nthan it was when poured from the pitcher. On one occasion Dr. Van\r\nVorst, my assistant, tells me that it had gained 12°. At the end of\r\nevery hour the result of the affusion is tested by the thermometer,\r\nand if the temperature has not fallen another affusion is practised,\r\nand this is kept up until the temperature comes down to 100°, or even\r\nless. It must be appreciated that the patient lies constantly in a\r\ncold wet sheet, but this never becomes a fomentation, for the reason\r\nthat as soon as it abstracts from the body sufficient heat to do so it\r\nis again wet with cold water and goes on still with its work of\r\nheat-abstraction. I have kept patients upon this cot enveloped in the\r\nwet sheet for two and three weeks, without discomfort to them and with\r\nthe most marked control over the degree of animal heat. Ordinarily,\r\nafter the temperature has come down to 99° or 100°, four or five hours\r\nwill pass before affusion again becomes necessary.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: \"The Most Effectual Method of Controlling the High\r\nTemperature occurring after Ovariotomy,\" _N.Y. Med. Jour._, August,\r\n1878.]\r\n\r\nSince reading this account, I have made a good many trials of the\r\nmethod upon puerperal women, and have not found that it agrees with\r\nall in an equal degree. In some instances the affusions have been\r\nfollowed, in spite of hot bottles to the feet and the administration\r\nof stimulants, by such a degree of depression and impairment of\r\ncardiac force, as shown by the persistent coldness of the extremities,\r\nthat it has been necessary to discontinue them. On the other hand, I\r\ncan look back upon cases, apparently so desperate that the condition\r\nof the patients was looked upon as hopeless, where they proved the\r\nmeans of saving life as by a miracle. Of course, the difference\r\ndepends upon whether the high temperature is the sole cause of the\r\nalarming symptoms, or whether the latter are in part due to\r\nblood-dissolution and secondary changes in the parenchymatous organs.\r\n\r\n{1036} The use of the coil in fever, whether of rubber or of metal\r\ntubing, I can highly recommend. Either the night-dress or a towel\r\nshould be placed between the coil and the skin. A current of cold\r\nwater passing through the tube rapidly abstracts the surface heat, and\r\nis usually grateful to the patient. The lowering of the temperature by\r\nthis means is much slower than by cold affusions. Disturbance of the\r\npatient is, however, avoided, and the method, so far as I have tried\r\nit, has been free from the objections incident to the direct\r\napplication of water to the skin.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to state that in puerperal, as in other fevers,\r\nthe patient's strength requires to be sustained and the waste of\r\ntissue to be repaired, as far as possible, by the regulated\r\nadministration of liquid food, as milk and beef-tea, in such\r\nquantities as can be borne by the stomach, and at one to two hours'\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of encysted peritoneal effusions, and in inflammatory\r\nexudations into the pelvic and adjacent cellular tissue, after the\r\nacute symptoms have subsided the attention should be directed to the\r\nafternoon fever and to promoting the assimilation of food. So soon as\r\nthe sweating and fever are checked the absorption of the plastic\r\nmaterials begins. The most important agents for accomplishing this\r\nobject are quinia, in moderate doses, combined with some form of\r\nalcohol and with tepid sponging. Deep-seated pain in the iliac region\r\nis best relieved by a large blister upon the side over the point where\r\nthe tenderness is felt. Prolonged rest in bed should be enjoined. Even\r\nafter convalescence is well advanced, so long as the exudation remains\r\nunabsorbed the resumption of household duties is pretty certain to be\r\nfollowed by a relapse or by the development of a chronic condition of\r\na most intractable description. The sooner the patient's stomach can\r\nbe got to digest and absorb beefsteak and iron the more speedy will be\r\nher recovery.\r\n\r\nIn pelvic exudations the hot vaginal douche, warm baths, and the\r\napplication of flannels wrung out in water to the abdomen aid in\r\ndiminishing the local pain, and, perhaps, in causing a disappearance\r\nof the tumor. The action of mercurials or of iodide of potassium in\r\nmelting away plastic inflammatory materials is sometimes very\r\nstriking, but more frequently they either do no good or else do harm\r\nby disturbing the digestion.\r\n\r\nIf fever, chills, and sweating announce the presence of pus, the most\r\ncareful exploration should be made to determine, if possible, the seat\r\nof suppuration. It is of great advantage to treat pelvic abscesses as\r\nabscesses are treated elsewhere in the body. If the redness of the\r\nskin above Poupart's ligament indicates a tendency to point in that\r\ndirection, an aspirator-needle should be introduced to make sure of\r\nthe diagnosis. If the sac is near the surface, a free incision should\r\nbe made and the pus should be allowed to escape. In many cases I make\r\nthese incisions three to four inches in length. The redness of the\r\nexternal skin makes it certain that the abscess has become adherent to\r\nthe abdominal wall, and that the incision consequently will not\r\ncommunicate with the peritoneum. After the abscess has been opened it\r\nshould be cleansed twice daily, and the cavity should be filled with\r\noakum. If, after a time, the granulations become flabby, Peruvian\r\nbalsam or iodoform should be introduced into the sac at each change of\r\nthe dressing. I can recommend this plan as essentially a mild\r\nprocedure. With a large opening for the discharge of {1037} pus the\r\nfever and sweating disappear, the appetite returns, and the abscess\r\nfills rapidly by granulation. With a small incision hectic is apt to\r\npersist, and the abscess to end in the formation of interminable\r\nfistulæ.\r\n\r\nIf softening and bagginess or distinct fluctuation indicate that the\r\npus can be reached through the vaginal cul-de-sac, the\r\naspirator-needle should be inserted deeply at the suspected point, and\r\nif a large amount of pus is detected, an incision should be made with\r\na long-handled bistoury, using the needle as a director, and making\r\nthe opening large enough to permit the introduction of a\r\ndrainage-tube. I prefer for this purpose a self-retaining Nélaton\r\ncatheter, which is easily passed by means of a uterine sound inserted\r\ninto the eye at the extremity. Through the tube--without disturbing\r\nthe patient--the pus-cavity can be washed as frequently as required,\r\nand with drainage and cleanliness cases of the longest standing may be\r\nexpected to recover.\r\n\r\nP. F. Mundé[78] has reported a number of cases of chronic character\r\nwhere the aspiration of pus has been followed by rapid absorption of\r\nthe intra-pelvic exudation. The presence of pus was suspected because\r\nof a boggy, doughy feeling in the exudation tumor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: \"Diagnosis and Treatment of Obscure Pelvic Abscess,\"\r\netc., _Arch. of Med._, December, 1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1038}\r\n\r\nBERIBERI.\r\n\r\nBY DUANE B. SIMMONS, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Beriberi is a disease of inanition, most common in\r\ntropical countries, though found in high latitudes (41° N.),\r\nespecially in low-lying seaboard towns, during the summer months, and\r\nis both endemic and epidemic. It is usually chronic in form, but is\r\nsubject to exacerbations of varying degrees, and has for its\r\ncharacteristic symptoms anæsthesia of the skin, hyperæsthesia and\r\nparalysis of the muscles, anasarca, palpitation, cardiac and arterial\r\nmurmurs (in the wet form), præcordial oppression, and abdominal\r\npulsation.\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--It was for a long time\r\nconfounded with a great variety of other diseases. The Anglo-Indian\r\nphysicians of Ceylon and the Malabar coast were no doubt the first to\r\nrecognize the specific nature of the disease, though it is claimed\r\nthat Chinese medical works of the thirteenth century contain a fairly\r\naccurate description of it.\r\n\r\nThe literature of beriberi, at the first glance, appears to be very\r\nmeagre, as some of the most popular medical works make no mention of\r\nthe disease at all, while others only give it a passing notice. Its\r\nbibliography, however, is very considerable, as may be seen in the\r\nexhaustive list in Billings' _Index Catalogue_, but for want of space\r\nwe refer only to the most recent contributions to the subject. These\r\nare--an article by A. LeRoy de Mericourt;[1] an essay by Tarissan,\r\nentitled _Beriberi in Brazil_; an article by Anderson,[2] and an essay\r\nby myself.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Dictionnaire Encyclopédique des Sciences Médicales_,\r\nParis, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Guy's Hospital Reports_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Chinese Maritime Customs Medical Report_ (1880).]\r\n\r\nFor a long time beriberi was supposed to have a peculiar territorial\r\nlimitation. It is now known to be more or less prevalent on all the\r\nislands and shores of Eastern Asia and Africa from Japan to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and in Brazil.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.--I know of no disease in regard to which a greater diversity\r\nof opinion exists as to its cause. Indeed, as one has observed,\r\n\"autant d'auteurs, autant d'opinions diverses.\" Ten years' study and\r\nobservation of the malady under a great variety of circumstances and\r\nconditions have led me to the definite conclusion that its exciting\r\ncause is a specific poison or germ, having many striking resemblances\r\nin its mode of production to paludal or marsh miasm, though entirely\r\ndistinct and separate from it. A great variety of predisposing causes,\r\nhowever, exert a powerful influence in rendering individuals or\r\nclasses susceptible to the {1039} disease, such as age, sex,[4]\r\noccupation, race, mode of life, diet, and climate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Women suffer from the disease much less frequently than\r\nmen.]\r\n\r\nCLINICAL HISTORY AND SYMPTOMS.--There are three forms of the disease:\r\n1st. Beriberi hydrops (wet beriberi), in which there is a hydræmic\r\ncondition of the blood, distension of the general areolar tissue, with\r\nserum, and effusion into the serous cavities. 2d. Beriberi atrophia\r\n(dry or atrophic beriberi), in which there is a notable deficiency of\r\nfluids in the vessels and areolar tissue, and atrophy of the muscles.\r\n3d. Mixed beriberi, in which the above forms lose the sharp lines of\r\ndistinction and merge into each other. Cases complicated with\r\ndysentery, diarrhoea, and especially with continued fevers of the\r\ntyphoid type, are not uncommon.[5] These last, besides being of grave\r\nprognosis, are frequently very embarrassing and difficult of\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Some authors have designated fatty or convulsive forms of\r\nthe disease, which I think unnecessary.]\r\n\r\nIn general terms, wet beriberi may be divided into two stages--the\r\nprodromic stage and the stage of attack; and into several types--the\r\nacute or pernicious, and the chronic. From the very insidious nature\r\nof the approach of the disease, sometimes extending over a period of\r\nseveral weeks, it is often very difficult, or even impossible, to\r\ndetermine the exact time of its invasion. It is generally admitted\r\nthat a residence of some weeks in an infected locality is necessary\r\nbefore any decided symptoms make their appearance. As in many other\r\ndiseases of slow development, the symptoms of the prodromic stage are\r\ncertain not easily defined feelings of indisposition, such as an\r\noccasional sense of chilliness, inaptitude for mental exertion, and\r\nespecially a tired feeling in the lower extremities. A period of\r\nuncertain length now intervenes, during which the characteristic\r\nsymptoms appear and constitute the stage of attack. The first of these\r\nsymptoms is, generally, anæsthesia of the skin over the anterior\r\ntibial muscles, in the tips of the fingers, and around the mouth, in\r\nthe order given. Paralysis in varying degrees next declares itself in\r\ncertain groups of muscles, usually those immediately underlying the\r\nregions of anæsthesia. One of the consequences of this is a drooping\r\nof the toes, causing the patient while walking to lift the feet high\r\nso as to clear the ground, thus occasioning the peculiar gait noticed\r\nby many observers as characteristic of the disease. A sense of\r\nconstriction in the muscles of the calves is experienced at the same\r\ntime, arising from a veritable contraction, which causes their\r\napparent enlargement and hardening, with tension of the tendo\r\nachillis. A feeling of tightness in the chest usually accompanies this\r\ncondition, due, no doubt, to partial paralysis of the muscles of\r\nrespiration. If firm pressure be now made upon the muscles in various\r\nparts of the body, a greater or less degree of tenderness will be\r\nfound to exist in many of them, and especially those occupying the\r\nposterior part of the leg, back of the forearm, inside of the arm, and\r\nupper part of the chest. Tenderness of the periosteum of the long\r\nbones and a peculiar roughness of their surfaces often exist also.\r\nPalpitation of the heart, especially on making any considerable\r\nexertion, is a frequent and often troublesome symptom, even at this\r\nstage of the disease.\r\n\r\nUp to this point the above symptoms are common to both the wet and\r\n{1040} dry forms of the malady, and to them the characteristic\r\nfeatures either of beriberi hydrops or atrophia are now added. The\r\nfirst manifestation of anasarca, the pathognomonic symptom of wet\r\nberiberi, is in an oedematous condition of the areolar tissue of the\r\nanterior part of the legs. This, in reality, is more or less general\r\neven at an early stage of the disease, as is evident from the plump\r\nappearance of the patient and a certain sallow-white color of the\r\nskin, especially of that of the face. In uncomplicated cases the\r\ntemperature is normal, or it may be at times a little below the normal\r\npoint. There is also little or no increase in the frequency of the\r\npulse. Its quality, however, is changed, and somewhat characteristic\r\nfor both forms of the disease. Thus in the wet form it is full, large,\r\nand easily compressible, indicating a great diminution of arterial\r\ntone, while in the dry form there is nearly an opposite condition. If\r\nthe heart be now examined, a decided systolic murmur will be heard,\r\nmost distinctly over the pulmonary valves; and in most cases of wet\r\nberiberi it exists in all the large arterial trunks. The heart\r\nfurnishes the usual signs of dilatation and want of tone. In the dry\r\nform the cardiac murmurs are either slight or wanting altogether, and\r\nthe area of cardiac dulness is variable, and frequently diminishes as\r\nthe disease advances.\r\n\r\nIn both wet and dry beriberi the appetite is little impaired in the\r\nearlier stages, but if in the former the stomach is over-distended,\r\nthere is increased præcordial oppression, and sometimes sudden death.\r\nThe bowels in the wet form are sluggish, and urine scanty; in the\r\nother there is but little deviation from the normal in these respects.\r\n\r\nThe cases of the subacute type are by far the most numerous. From this\r\nit is evident that the acute or pernicious type of the malady is, in\r\nmost cases, only an exaggeration of the subacute, as observed in some\r\nother diseases, notably rheumatism and those of marsh malarial origin.\r\nThe term pernicious is, strictly speaking, applicable to the wet form\r\nof the disease only, as the dry form is rarely, if ever, rapidly\r\nfatal. A marked case of wet beriberi is always to be regarded as\r\ndangerous, from the suddenness with which pernicious symptoms often\r\ndeclare themselves. In these the anasarca (which, as has been stated,\r\nconstitutes the leading clinical difference between the two forms of\r\nthe malady) plays an important rôle. It often happens that in the\r\ncourse of a few hours the local oedema in the extremities and the\r\nslight puffiness of the face become general and extreme, and the neck\r\nis enormously swollen by the distension of the veins, both deep and\r\nsuperficial. The pleural and pericardial sacs are more or less\r\ndistended with serum, thus mechanically embarrassing the action of the\r\norgans they contain. The action of the heart now becomes laborious,\r\nthe lungs oedematous and filled with coarse râles, and a terrible\r\nsense of suffocation comes over the patient, causing him to seek\r\nrelief by constant change of position. The stomach is irritable, a\r\ngreenish-yellow fluid is vomited, and death closes the scene. The\r\nacute stage of dry beriberi, on the contrary, is characterized by a\r\nrapid diminution of the fluids of the body and muscular atrophy.\r\n\r\nThe annual appearance in the same individual of either wet or dry\r\nberiberi, and its long continuance, constitute the chronic type of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nMORBID ANATOMY.--The morbid anatomical changes in beriberi vary\r\nconsiderably with its form. Few, if any, observers claim seriously to\r\n{1041} have found in either the wet or dry form of the disease\r\nevidences of acute inflammatory action in any of the tissues or\r\norgans. The blood undoubtedly undergoes important morbid changes,\r\nwhereby its nutritive and oxygenating power is impaired, indicating\r\nthat this is a disease of inanition. This shows itself most markedly\r\nin necrobiotic and degenerative changes, especially in the muscular\r\ntissues, which are the seat of the leading morbid phenomena in all\r\nstages of both forms of this disease. The respiratory, digestive, and\r\nglandular systems rarely undergo morbid changes other than those of a\r\nsecondary or passive kind, such as engorgement with serum and venous\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the organs contained in the cranial and spinal\r\ncavities is variable and inconstant. According to some observers, the\r\nsubstance of the brain and spinal cord is hardened. The greater number\r\nby far, however, have found it more or less softened.[6] The heart in\r\nwet beriberi is habitually large and flabby, its muscular tissue\r\nsoftened and of a pale-yellow and macerated appearance. Its cavities\r\nare engorged with dark blood, sometimes fluid, but more often clotted.\r\nThese clots are often voluminous in the right heart, semi-fibrinous,\r\nand extend into the pulmonary artery and great venous trunks, which\r\nare enormously enlarged. The cardiac muscular tissue I always found to\r\nhave undergone metamorphic changes, varying from granular clouding to\r\nadvanced fatty degeneration.[7] The tissue of the paralyzed voluntary\r\nmuscles undergoes degenerative changes in both forms of the disease.\r\nIn the extreme atrophy of dry beriberi I have not unfrequently found\r\nmany of the sarcolemma sheaths completely emptied of their contents.\r\nThe power of regeneration in these cases is often wonderfully\r\ndisplayed by an almost complete restoration of the lost elements, and,\r\nin a corresponding degree, of the function of the part.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The former condition was undoubtedly observed in\r\nautopsies made of the dry or atrophic form of the disease, though this\r\nfact is not mentioned. The latter, or softened, condition of the\r\ncerebro-spinal contents belongs to the wet form of the disease (my own\r\ncases being of this kind). I regard this softening as not ante-mortem,\r\nbut as consecutive to serous imbibition (as observed by Eismann and\r\nSanders in chlorosis), and as taking place during the last moments of\r\nlife or after death, when the vital forces no longer oppose themselves\r\nto the mechanical disintegrating power of the fluid with which the\r\nnervous as well as all the other tissues of the body are engorged.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: I believe this to be the condition of the heart-muscle in\r\nall cases of death from the wet form of beriberi. In this opinion I am\r\nsupported by Oudenhoven and many of the Dutch observers.]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that in wet beriberi the heart is first weakened by\r\nparesis of the cardiac ganglia, with consequent incomplete emptying of\r\nits cavities. This, in connection with rapid degenerative changes in\r\nits muscular tissue, causes the walls to yield to the blood-pressure,\r\nproducing dilatation and tricuspid insufficiency, with regurgitation\r\nand consequent capillary stasis and dropsy. Vaso-motor\r\nnerve-paralysis, acting at the same time on the pulmonary artery and\r\narterioles, and on other large arterial trunks, probably gives rise to\r\nthe murmurs heard in them. In the dry form of the disease the\r\nvaso-motor nerve-paralysis is less pronounced, and the degenerative\r\nchanges in the muscular tissue of the heart slower, while the marked\r\ndecrease in the fluids of the system and the great failure of\r\nnutrition tend toward atrophic changes. From this it follows that we\r\nusually have, instead of a large dilated heart, a small weak one, with\r\na narrow tricuspid orifice instead of a dilated one; little or no\r\n{1042} intercostal pulsation, and hence less cardiac dulness; no\r\nvenous distension or capillary stasis, and hence no dropsy.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.--In temperate climates the prognosis of uncomplicated\r\nberiberi is favorable in a majority of cases. In seasons of its\r\nepidemic prevalence, however, all cases of the wet form of the disease\r\nmust be carefully watched, as it not unfrequently happens that grave\r\nsymptoms suddenly appear at a time when no danger has been\r\nanticipated. An unfavorable prognosis may be ventured when, in a case\r\nof wet beriberi, relief is not obtained by free purging or when\r\nvomiting sets in. In dry beriberi the termination in death is\r\nexceedingly rare as a direct result of the action of the poison\r\nproducing the disease, so that when death does occur it is chiefly\r\nfrom exhaustion. The time of recovery depends on the amount of\r\nmuscular degeneration, and also upon the season of the year when the\r\nattack occurred, as all cases of both forms of beriberi usually get\r\nwell without treatment during the winter months.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--The well-established fact of the influence of certain\r\nlocalities in the production of beriberi makes the removal of the\r\npatient from them a hygienic measure of great importance, and this is\r\nfrequently the only treatment necessary if it can be done early. The\r\neffect of the change is often almost magical, especially if it be made\r\nto an elevated locality and among the mountains.\r\n\r\nDiet is an important element in the treatment of beriberi. At the head\r\nof the list of foods to be avoided is rice. Coarsely prepared grains,\r\nsuch as wheat, barley, certain kinds of beans,[8] apparently because\r\nof more or less laxative properties, are preferable as articles of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: A small red bean called adzuke, possessing both laxative\r\nand diuretic properties, is a favorite remedy with the Japanese for\r\nberiberi. It is used alone or mixed with rice, and is not unfrequently\r\nthe only means resorted to for the successful cure of mild cases.]\r\n\r\nNo drug has been discovered possessing specific properties in this\r\ndisease. In the wet form, medication consists in the administration of\r\ndrugs calculated to draw off the excess of serum in the areolar\r\ntissues and in the serous sacs. First in point of efficacy for this\r\npurpose are the hydragogue cathartics. In my own practice the sulphate\r\nof magnesia, in large and repeated doses, has given the best results;\r\nelaterium, a powder of jalap, squill, and digitalis, and, in fact, any\r\nmedicine which will give frequent and copious stools, are sure to\r\nafford marked relief to the more urgent symptoms, and in many cases\r\nwill alone effect a cure. Care must be taken, however, not to exhaust\r\nthe patient, though I have never seen the judicious use of this method\r\nof treatment do harm.\r\n\r\nCopious bleeding is recommended by Anderson, especially in the stage\r\nof greatest danger, but I have never been able to convince myself of\r\nits safety.\r\n\r\nThe almost specific virtue claimed by the old Indian physicians for\r\ntreeak farook is no doubt due to its cathartic properties.\r\n\r\nDiuretics are indicated for the same reason as cathartics, and any of\r\nthe more active are productive of good results. They are too slow in\r\ntheir action, however, to be relied on otherwise than as adjuvants to\r\ncathartics. I have found juniper gin to answer an excellent purpose,\r\nboth as a stimulant and diuretic, where there was danger of exhaustion\r\nfrom the free use of cathartics.\r\n\r\nThe medical treatment of dry beriberi differs materially from that of\r\n{1043} the wet disease. Cathartics and diuretics are alike useless,\r\nand the former injurious. The ordinary means, such as electricity,\r\nstrychnia, frictions, etc., employed in cases of muscular atrophy and\r\nparalysis from other causes, are indicated when the active stage has\r\npassed, but they are useless, and even injurious, before this time.\r\nThe muscular hyperæsthesia common to both forms of the disease may be\r\ngenerally greatly relieved by anodyne liniments containing aconite.\r\nThe internal use of the latter is highly recommended by some.\r\nHypodermic injections of morphia afford relief to the painful sense of\r\nconstriction in the calves of the legs so often complained of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1045}\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAbdomen, state of, in cholera, 741\r\n    in general peritonitis of puerperal fever, 1010\r\n    in relapsing
