No\r\nchild has ever been in the whole of the Gardens, because it is so soon\r\ntime to turn back.  The reason it is soon time to turn back is that, if\r\nyou are as small as David, you sleep from twelve to one.  If your\r\nmother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one, you could\r\nmost likely see the whole of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nurse]\r\n\r\nThe Gardens are bounded on one side by a never-ending line of\r\nomnibuses, over which your nurse has such authority that if she holds\r\nup her finger to any one of them it stops immediately.  She then\r\ncrosses with you in safety to the other side.  There are more gates to\r\nthe Gardens than one gate, but that is the one you go in at, and before\r\nyou go in you speak to the lady with the balloons, who sits just\r\noutside.  This is as near to being inside as she may venture, because,\r\nif she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment, the\r\nballoons would lift her up, and she would be flown away.  She sits very\r\nsquat, for the balloons are always tugging at her, and the strain has\r\ngiven her quite a red face.  Once she was a new one, because the old\r\none had let go, and David was very sorry for the old one, but as she\r\ndid let go, he wished he had been there to see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The lady with the balloons, who sits just outside._]\r\n\r\nThe Gardens are a tremendous big place, with millions and hundreds of\r\ntrees; and first you come to the Figs, but you scorn to loiter there,\r\nfor the Figs is the resort of superior little persons, who are\r\nforbidden to mix with the commonalty, and is so named, according to\r\nlegend, because they dress in full fig.  These dainty ones are\r\nthemselves contemptuously called Figs by David and other heroes, and\r\nyou have a key to the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of\r\nthe Gardens when I tell you that cricket is called crickets here.\r\nOccasionally a rebel Fig climbs over the fence into the world, and such\r\na one was Miss Mabel Grey, of whom I shall tell you when we come to\r\nMiss Mabel Grey's gate.  She was the only really celebrated Fig.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the Broad Walk, and it is as much bigger than the other\r\nwalks as your father is bigger than you.  David wondered if it began\r\nlittle, and grew and grew, until it was quite grown up, and whether the\r\nother walks are its babies, and he drew a picture, which diverted him\r\nvery much, of the Broad Walk giving a tiny walk an airing in a\r\nperambulator.  In the Broad Walk you meet all the people who are worth\r\nknowing, and there is usually a grown-up with them to prevent them\r\ngoing on the damp grass, and to make them stand disgraced at the corner\r\nof a seat if they have been mad-dog or Mary-Annish.  To be Mary-Annish\r\nis to behave like a girl, whimpering because nurse won't carry you, or\r\nsimpering with your thumb in your mouth, and it is a hateful quality;\r\nbut to be mad-dog is to kick out at everything, and there is some\r\nsatisfaction in that.\r\n\r\nIf I were to point out all the notable places as we pass up the Broad\r\nWalk, it would be time to turn back before we reach them, and I simply\r\nwave my stick at Cecco Hewlett's Tree, that memorable spot where a boy\r\ncalled Cecco lost his penny, and, looking for it, found twopence.\r\nThere has been a good deal of excavation going on there ever since.\r\nFarther up the walk is the little wooden house in which Marmaduke Perry\r\nhid.  There is no more awful story of the Gardens than this of\r\nMarmaduke Perry, who had been Mary-Annish three days in succession, and\r\nwas sentenced to appear in the Broad Walk dressed in his sister's\r\nclothes.  He hid in the little wooden house, and refused to emerge\r\nuntil they brought him knickerbockers with pockets.\r\n\r\nYou now try to go to the Round Pond, but nurses hate it, because they\r\nare not really manly, and they make you look the other way, at the Big\r\nPenny and the Baby's Palace.  She was the most celebrated baby of the\r\nGardens, and lived in the palace all alone, with ever so many dolls, so\r\npeople rang the bell, and up she got out of her bed, though it was past\r\nsix o'clock, and she lighted a candle and opened the door in her\r\nnighty, and then they all cried with great rejoicings, 'Hail, Queen of\r\nEngland!'  What puzzled David most was how she knew where the matches\r\nwere kept.  The Big Penny is a statue about her.\r\n\r\nNext we come to the Hump, which is the part of the Broad Walk where all\r\nthe big races are run; and even though you had no intention of running\r\nyou do run when you come to the Hump, it is such a fascinating,\r\nslide-down kind of place.  Often you stop when you have run about\r\nhalf-way down it, and then you are lost; but there is another little\r\nwooden house near here, called the Lost House, and so you tell the man\r\nthat you are lost and then he finds you.  It is glorious fun racing\r\ndown the Hump, but you can't do it on windy days because then you are\r\nnot there, but the fallen leaves do it instead of you.  There is almost\r\nnothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf.\r\n\r\nFrom the Hump we can see the gate that is called after Miss Mabel Grey,\r\nthe Fig I promised to tell you about.  There were always two nurses\r\nwith her, or else one mother and one nurse, and for a long time she was\r\na pattern-child who always coughed off the table and said, 'How do you\r\ndo?' to the other Figs, and the only game she played at was flinging a\r\nball gracefully and letting the nurse bring it back to her.  Then one\r\nday she tired of it all and went mad-dog, and, first, to show that she\r\nreally was mad-dog, she unloosened both her boot-laces and put out her\r\ntongue east, west, north, and south.  She then flung her sash into a\r\npuddle and danced on it till dirty water was squirted over her frock,\r\nafter which she climbed the fence and had a series of incredible\r\nadventures, one of the least of which was that she kicked off both her\r\nboots.  At last she came to the gate that is now called after her, out\r\nof which she ran into streets David and I have never been in though we\r\nhave heard them roaring, and still she ran on and would never again\r\nhave been heard of had not her mother jumped into a 'bus and thus\r\novertaken her.  It all happened, I should say, long ago, and this is\r\nnot the Mabel Grey whom David knows.\r\n\r\nReturning up the Broad Walk we have on our right the Baby Walk, which\r\nis so full of perambulators that you could cross from side to side\r\nstepping on babies, but the nurses won't let you do it.  From this walk\r\na passage called Bunting's Thumb, because it is that length, leads into\r\nPicnic Street, where there are real kettles, and chestnut-blossom falls\r\ninto your mug as you are drinking.  Quite common children picnic here\r\nalso, and the blossom falls into their mugs just the same.\r\n\r\nNext comes St. Govor's Well, which was full of water when Malcolm the\r\nBold fell into it.  He was his mother's favourite, and he let her put\r\nher arm round his neck in public because she was a widow; but he was\r\nalso partial to adventures, and liked to play with a chimney-sweep who\r\nhad killed a good many bears.  The sweep's name was Sooty, and one day,\r\nwhen they were playing near the well, Malcolm fell in and would have\r\nbeen drowned had not Sooty dived in and rescued him; and the water had\r\nwashed Sooty clean, and he now stood revealed as Malcolm's long-lost\r\nfather.  So Malcolm would not let his mother put her arm round his neck\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nBetween the well and the Round Pond are the cricket pitches, and\r\nfrequently the choosing of sides exhausts so much time that there is\r\nscarcely any cricket.  Everybody wants to bat first, and as soon as he\r\nis out he bowls unless you are the better wrestler, and while you are\r\nwrestling with him the fielders have scattered to play at something\r\nelse.  The Gardens are noted for two kinds of cricket: boy cricket,\r\nwhich is real cricket with a bat, and girl cricket, which is with a\r\nracquet and the governess.  Girls can't really play cricket, and when\r\nyou are watching their futile efforts you make funny sounds at them.\r\nNevertheless, there was a very disagreeable incident one day when some\r\nforward girls challenged David's team, and a disturbing creature called\r\nAngela Clare sent down so many yorkers that--However, instead of\r\ntelling you the result of that regrettable match I shall pass on\r\nhurriedly to the Round Pond, which is the wheel that keeps all the\r\nGardens going.\r\n\r\nIt is round because it is in the very middle of the Gardens, and when\r\nyou are come to it you never want to go any farther.  You can't be good\r\nall the time at the Round Pond, however much you try.  You can be good\r\nin the Broad Walk all the time, but not at the Round Pond, and the\r\nreason is that you forget, and, when you remember, you are so wet that\r\nyou may as well be wetter.  There are men who sail boats on the Round\r\nPond, such big boats that they bring them in barrows, and sometimes in\r\nperambulators, and then the baby has to walk.  The bow-legged children\r\nin the Gardens are those who had to walk too soon because their father\r\nneeded the perambulator.\r\n\r\nYou always want to have a yacht to sail on the Round Pond, and in the\r\nend your uncle gives you one; and to carry it to the pond the first day\r\nis splendid, also to talk about it to boys who have no uncle is\r\nsplendid, but soon you like to leave it at home.  For the sweetest\r\ncraft that slips her moorings in the Round Pond is what is called a\r\nstick-boat, because she is rather like a stick until she is in the\r\nwater and you are holding the string.  Then as you walk round, pulling\r\nher, you see little men running about her deck, and sails rise\r\nmagically and catch the breeze, and you put in on dirty nights at snug\r\nharbours which are unknown to the lordly yachts.  Night passes in a\r\ntwink, and again your rakish craft noses for the wind, whales spout,\r\nyou glide over buried cities, and have brushes with pirates, and cast\r\nanchor on coral isles.  You are a solitary boy while all this is taking\r\nplace, for two boys together cannot adventure far upon the Round Pond,\r\nand though you may talk to yourself throughout the voyage, giving\r\norders and executing them with despatch, you know not, when it is time\r\nto go home, where you have been or what swelled your sails; your\r\ntreasure-trove is all locked away in your hold, so to speak, which will\r\nbe opened, perhaps, by another little boy many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut those yachts have nothing in their hold.  Does any one return to\r\nthis haunt of his youth because of the yachts that used to sail it?  Oh\r\nno.  It is the stick-boat that is freighted with memories.  The yachts\r\nare toys, their owner a fresh-water mariner; they can cross and recross\r\na pond only while the stick-boat goes to sea.  You yachtsmen with your\r\nwands, who think we are all there to gaze on you, your ships are only\r\naccidents of this place, and were they all to be boarded and sunk by\r\nthe ducks, the real business of the Round Pond would be carried on as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nPaths from everywhere crowd like children to the pond.  Some of them\r\nare ordinary paths, which have a rail on each side, and are made by men\r\nwith their coats off, but others are vagrants, wide at one spot, and at\r\nanother so narrow that you can stand astride them.  They are called\r\nPaths that have Made Themselves, and David did wish he could see them\r\ndoing it.  But, like all the most wonderful things that happen in the\r\nGardens, it is done, we concluded, at night after the gates are closed.\r\nWe have also decided that the paths make themselves because it is their\r\nonly chance of getting to the Round Pond.\r\n\r\nOne of these gypsy paths comes from the place where the sheep get their\r\nhair cut.  When David shed his curls at the hair-dressers, I am told,\r\nhe said good-bye to them without a tremor, though his mother has never\r\nbeen quite the same bright creature since; so he despises the sheep as\r\nthey run from their shearer, and calls out tauntingly, 'Cowardy,\r\ncowardy custard!'  But when the man grips them between his legs David\r\nshakes a fist at him for using such big scissors.  Another startling\r\nmoment is when the man turns back the grimy wool from the sheeps'\r\nshoulders and they look suddenly like ladies in the stalls of a\r\ntheatre.  The sheep are so frightened by the shearing that it makes\r\nthem quite white and thin, and as soon as they are set free they begin\r\nto nibble the grass at once, quite anxiously, as if they feared that\r\nthey would never be worth eating.  David wonders whether they know each\r\nother, now that they are so different, and if it makes them fight with\r\nthe wrong ones.  They are great fighters, and thus so unlike country\r\nsheep that every year they give my St. Bernard dog, Porthos, a shock.\r\nHe can make a field of country sheep fly by merely announcing his\r\napproach, but these town sheep come toward him with no promise of\r\ngentle entertainment, and then a light from last year breaks upon\r\nPorthos.  He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about\r\nhim as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he strolls\r\naway with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his\r\neye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Porthos]\r\n\r\nThe Serpentine begins near here.  It is a lovely lake, and there is a\r\ndrowned forest at the bottom of it.  If you peer over the edge you can\r\nsee the trees all growing upside down, and they say that at night there\r\nare also drowned stars in it.  If so, Peter Pan sees them when he is\r\nsailing across the lake in the Thrush's Nest.  A small part only of the\r\nSerpentine is in the Gardens, for soon it passes beneath a bridge to\r\nfar away where the island is on which all the birds are born that\r\nbecome baby boys and girls.  No one who is human, except Peter Pan (and\r\nhe is only half human), can land on the island, but you may write what\r\nyou want (boy or girl, dark or fair) on a piece of paper, and then\r\ntwist it into the shape of a boat and slip it into the water, and it\r\nreaches Peter Pan's island after dark.\r\n\r\nWe are on the way home now, though of course, it is all pretence that\r\nwe can go to so many of the places in one day.  I should have had to be\r\ncarrying David long ago, and resting on every seat like old Mr.\r\nSalford.  That was what we called him, because he always talked to us\r\nof a lovely place called Salford where he had been born.  He was a\r\ncrab-apple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens from\r\nseat to seat trying to fall in with somebody who was acquainted with\r\nthe town of Salford, and when we had known him for a year or more we\r\nactually did meet another aged solitary who had once spent Saturday to\r\nMonday in Salford.  He was meek and timid, and carried his address\r\ninside his hat, and whatever part of London he was in search of he\r\nalways went to Westminster Abbey first as a starting-point.  Him we\r\ncarried in triumph to our other friend, with the story of that Saturday\r\nto Monday, and never shall I forget the gloating joy with which Mr.\r\nSalford leapt at him.  They have been cronies ever since, and I noticed\r\nthat Mr. Salford, who naturally does most of the talking, keeps tight\r\ngrip of the other old man's coat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old Mr. Salford was a crab-apple of an old gentleman\r\nwho wandered all day in the Gardens._]\r\n\r\nThe two last places before you come to our gate are the Dog's Cemetery\r\nand the chaffinches nest, but we pretend not to know what the Dog's\r\nCemetery is, as Porthos is always with us.  The nest is very sad.  It\r\nis quite white, and the way we found it was wonderful.  We were having\r\nanother look among the bushes for David's lost worsted ball, and\r\ninstead of the ball we found a lovely nest made of the worsted, and\r\ncontaining four eggs, with scratches on them very like David's\r\nhandwriting, so we think they must have been the mother's love-letters\r\nto the little ones inside.  Every day we were in the Gardens we paid a\r\ncall at the nest, taking care that no cruel boy should see us, and we\r\ndropped crumbs, and soon the bird knew us as friends, and sat in the\r\nnest looking at us kindly with her shoulders hunched up.  But one day\r\nwhen we went there were only two eggs in the nest, and the next time\r\nthere were none.  The saddest part of it was that the poor little\r\nchaffinch fluttered about the bushes, looking so reproachfully at us\r\nthat we knew she thought we had done it; and though David tried to\r\nexplain to her, it was so long since he had spoken the bird language\r\nthat I fear she did not understand.  He and I left the Gardens that day\r\nwith our knuckles in our eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPETER PAN\r\n\r\nIf you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a\r\nlittle girl, she will say, 'Why, of course I did, child'; and if you\r\nask her whether he rode on a goat in those days, she will say, 'What a\r\nfoolish question to ask; certainly he did.'  Then if you ask your\r\ngrandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl, she\r\nalso says, 'Why, of course I did, child,' but if you ask her whether he\r\nrode on a goat in those days, she says she never heard of his having a\r\ngoat.  Perhaps she has forgotten, just as she sometimes forgets your\r\nname and calls you Mildred, which is your mother's name.  Still, she\r\ncould hardly forget such an important thing as the goat.  Therefore\r\nthere was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl.  This shows\r\nthat, in telling the story of Peter Pan, to begin with the goat (as\r\nmost people do) is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest.\r\n\r\nOf course, it also shows that Peter is ever so old, but he is really\r\nalways the same age, so that does not matter in the least.  His age is\r\none week, and though he was born so long ago he has never had a\r\nbirthday, nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one.\r\nThe reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days\r\nold; he escaped by the window and flew back to the Kensington Gardens.\r\n\r\nIf you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape, it shows\r\nhow completely you have forgotten your own young days.  When David\r\nheard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to\r\nescape, but I told him to think back hard, pressing his hands to his\r\ntemples, and when he had done this hard, and even harder, he distinctly\r\nremembered a youthful desire to return to the tree-tops, and with that\r\nmemory came others, as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as\r\nsoon as his mother was asleep, and how she had once caught him half-way\r\nup the chimney.  All children could have such recollections if they\r\nwould press their hands hard to their temples, for, having been birds\r\nbefore they were human, they are naturally a little wild during the\r\nfirst few weeks, and very itchy at the shoulders, where their wings\r\nused to be.  So David tells me.\r\n\r\nI ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story:\r\nFirst I tell it to him, and then he tells it to me, the understanding\r\nbeing that it is quite a different story; and then I retell it with his\r\nadditions, and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more\r\nhis story or mine.  In this story of Peter Pan, for instance, the bald\r\nnarrative and most of the moral reflections are mine, though not all,\r\nfor this boy can be a stern moralist; but the interesting bits about\r\nthe ways and customs of babies in the bird-stage are mostly\r\nreminiscences of David's, recalled by pressing his hands to his temples\r\nand thinking hard.\r\n\r\nWell, Peter Pan got out by the window, which had no bars.  Standing on\r\nthe ledge he could see trees far away, which were doubtless the\r\nKensington Gardens, and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that\r\nhe was now a little boy in a nightgown, and away he flew, right over\r\nthe houses to the Gardens.  It is wonderful that he could fly without\r\nwings, but the place itched tremendously, and--and--perhaps we could\r\nall fly if we were as dead-confident-sure of our capacity to do it as\r\nwas bold Peter Pan that evening.\r\n\r\nHe alighted gaily on the open sward, between the Baby's Palace and the\r\nSerpentine, and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick.\r\nHe was quite unaware already that he had ever been human, and thought\r\nhe was a bird, even in appearance, just the same as in his early days,\r\nand when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason\r\nhe missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand,\r\nwhich, of course, a bird never does.  He saw, however, that it must be\r\npast Lock-out Time, for there were a good many fairies about, all too\r\nbusy to notice him; they were getting breakfast ready, milking their\r\ncows, drawing water, and so on, and the sight of the water-pails made\r\nhim thirsty, so he flew over to the Round Pond to have a drink.  He\r\nstooped and dipped his beak in the pond; he thought it was his beak,\r\nbut, of course, it was only his nose, and therefore, very little water\r\ncame up, and that not so refreshing as usual, so next he tried a\r\npuddle, and he fell flop into it.  When a real bird falls in flop, he\r\nspreads out his feathers and pecks them dry, but Peter could not\r\nremember what was the thing to do, and he decided rather sulkily to go\r\nto sleep on the weeping-beech in the Baby Walk.\r\n\r\nAt first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch, but\r\npresently he remembered the way, and fell asleep.  He awoke long before\r\nmorning, shivering, and saying to himself, 'I never was out on such a\r\ncold night'; he had really been out on colder nights when he was a\r\nbird, but, of course, as everybody knows, what seems a warm night to a\r\nbird is a cold night to a boy in a nightgown.  Peter also felt\r\nstrangely uncomfortable, as if his head was stuffy; he heard loud\r\nnoises that made him look round sharply, though they were really\r\nhimself sneezing.  There was something he wanted very much, but, though\r\nhe knew he wanted it, he could not think what it was.  What he wanted\r\nso much was his mother to blow his nose, but that never struck him, so\r\nhe decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment.  They are\r\nreputed to know a good deal.\r\n\r\nThere were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk, with their arms\r\nround each other's waists, and he hopped down to address them.  The\r\nfairies have their tiffs with the birds, but they usually give a civil\r\nanswer to a civil question, and he was quite angry when these two ran\r\naway the moment they saw him.  Another was lolling on a garden chair,\r\nreading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall, and when he\r\nheard Peter's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _When he heard Peter's voice he popped in alarm behind a\r\ntulip._]\r\n\r\nTo Peter's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from\r\nhim.  A band of workmen, who were sawing down a toadstool, rushed away,\r\nleaving their tools behind them.  A milkmaid turned her pail upside\r\ndown and hid in it.  Soon the Gardens were in an uproar.  Crowds of\r\nfairies were running this way and that, asking each other stoutly who\r\nwas afraid; lights were extinguished, doors barricaded, and from the\r\ngrounds of Queen Mab's palace came the rub-a-dub of drums, showing that\r\nthe royal guard had been called out.  A regiment of Lancers came\r\ncharging down the Broad Walk, armed with holly-leaves, with which they\r\njag the enemy horribly in passing.  Peter heard the little people\r\ncrying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out\r\nTime, but he never thought for a moment that he was the human.  He was\r\nfeeling stuffier and stuffier, and more and more wistful to learn what\r\nhe wanted done to his nose, but he pursued them with the vital question\r\nin vain; the timid creatures ran from him, and even the Lancers, when\r\nhe approached them up the Hump, turned swiftly into a side-walk, on the\r\npretence that they saw him there.\r\n\r\nDespairing of the fairies, he resolved to consult the birds, but now he\r\nremembered, as an odd thing, that all the birds on the weeping-beech\r\nhad flown away when he alighted on it, and though this had not troubled\r\nhim at the time, he saw its meaning now.  Every living thing was\r\nshunning him.  Poor little Peter Pan! he sat down and cried, and even\r\nthen he did not know that, for a bird, he was sitting on his wrong\r\npart.  It is a blessing that he did not know, for otherwise he would\r\nhave lost faith in his power to fly, and the moment you doubt whether\r\nyou can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.  The reason birds\r\ncan fly and we can't is simply that they have perfect faith, for to\r\nhave faith is to have wings.\r\n\r\nNow, except by flying, no one can reach the island in the Serpentine,\r\nfor the boats of humans are forbidden to land there, and there are\r\nstakes round it, standing up in the water, on each of which a\r\nbird-sentinel sits by day and night.  It was to the island that Peter\r\nnow flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw, and he\r\nalighted on it with relief, much heartened to find himself at last at\r\nhome, as the birds call the island.  All of them were asleep, including\r\nthe sentinels, except Solomon, who was wide awake on one side, and he\r\nlistened quietly to Peter's adventures, and then told him their true\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Put his strange case before old Solomon Caw._]\r\n\r\n'Look at your nightgown, if you don't believe me,' Solomon said; and\r\nwith staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown, and then at the\r\nsleeping birds.  Not one of them wore anything.\r\n\r\n'How many of your toes are thumbs?' said Solomon a little cruelly, and\r\nPeter saw to his consternation, that all his toes were fingers.  The\r\nshock was so great that it drove away his cold.\r\n\r\n'Ruffle your feathers,' said that grim old Solomon, and Peter tried\r\nmost desperately hard to ruffle his feathers, but he had none.  Then he\r\nrose up, quaking, and for the first time since he stood on the window\r\nledge, he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him.\r\n\r\n'I think I shall go back to mother,' he said timidly.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look.\r\n\r\nBut Peter hesitated.  'Why don't you go?' the old one asked politely.\r\n\r\n'I suppose,' said Peter huskily, 'I suppose I can still fly.'\r\n\r\nYou see he had lost faith.\r\n\r\n'Poor little half-and-half!' said Solomon, who was not really\r\nhard-hearted, 'you will never be able to fly again, not even on windy\r\ndays.  You must live here on the island always.'\r\n\r\n'And never even go to the Kensington Gardens?' Peter asked tragically.\r\n\r\n'How could you get across?' said Solomon.  He promised very kindly,\r\nhowever, to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by\r\none of such an awkward shape.\r\n\r\n'Then I shan't be exactly a human?' Peter asked.\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Nor exactly a bird?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'What shall I be?'\r\n\r\n'You will be a Betwixt-and-Between,' Solomon said, and certainly he was\r\na wise old fellow, for that is exactly how it turned out.\r\n\r\nThe birds on the island never got used to him.  His oddities tickled\r\nthem every day, as if they were quite new, though it was really the\r\nbirds that were new.  They came out of the eggs daily, and laughed at\r\nhim at once; then off they soon flew to be humans, and other birds came\r\nout of other eggs; and so it went on for ever.  The crafty\r\nmother-birds, when they tired of sitting on their eggs, used to get the\r\nyoung ones to break their shells a day before the right time by\r\nwhispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or\r\ndrinking or eating.  Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do\r\nthese things, just as you watch the peacocks, and they screamed with\r\ndelight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead\r\nof in the usual way with the mouth.  All his food was brought to him\r\nfrom the Gardens at Solomon's orders by the birds.  He would not eat\r\nworms or insects (which they thought very silly of him), so they\r\nbrought him bread in their beaks.  Thus, when you cry out, 'Greedy!\r\nGreedy!' to the bird that flies away with the big crust, you know now\r\nthat you ought not to do this, for he is very likely taking it to Peter\r\nPan.\r\n\r\nPeter wore no nightgown now.  You see, the birds were always begging\r\nhim for bits of it to line their nests with, and, being very\r\ngood-natured, he could not refuse, so by Solomon's advice he had hidden\r\nwhat was left of it.  But, though he was now quite naked, you must not\r\nthink that he was cold or unhappy.  He was usually very happy and gay,\r\nand the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him\r\nmany of the bird ways.  To be easily pleased, for instance, and always\r\nto be really doing something, and to think that whatever he was doing\r\nwas a thing of vast importance.  Peter became very clever at helping\r\nthe birds to build their nests; soon he could build better than a\r\nwood-pigeon, and nearly as well as a blackbird, though never did he\r\nsatisfy the finches, and he made nice little water-troughs near the\r\nnests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers.  He also\r\nbecame very learned in bird-lore, and knew an east wind from a west\r\nwind by its smell, and he could see the grass growing and hear the\r\ninsects walking about inside the tree-trunks.  But the best thing\r\nSolomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart.  All birds have\r\nglad hearts unless you rob their nests, and so as they were the only\r\nkind of heart Solomon knew about, it was easy to him to teach Peter how\r\nto have one.\r\n\r\nPeter's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long, just\r\nas the birds sing for joy, but, being partly human, he needed an\r\ninstrument, so he made a pipe of reeds, and he used to sit by the shore\r\nof the island of an evening, practising the sough of the wind and the\r\nripple of the water, and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon,\r\nand he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that\r\neven the birds were deceived, and they would say to each other, 'Was\r\nthat a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish\r\non his pipe?'  And sometimes he played the birth of birds, and then the\r\nmothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an\r\negg.  If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree\r\nnear the bridge, which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts,\r\nbut perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way.  It is\r\nbecause Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come, and the\r\nchestnut being so near, hears him and is cheated.\r\n\r\nBut as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he\r\nsometimes fell into sad thoughts, and then the music became sad also,\r\nand the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the\r\nGardens, though he could see them through the arch of the bridge.  He\r\nknew he could never be a real human again, and scarcely wanted to be\r\none, but oh! how he longed to play as other children play, and of\r\ncourse there is no such lovely place to play in as the Gardens.  The\r\nbirds brought him news of how boys and girls play, and wistful tears\r\nstarted in Peter's eyes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you wonder why he did not swim across.  The reason was that he\r\ncould not swim.  He wanted to know how to swim, but no one on the\r\nisland knew the way except the ducks, and they are so stupid.  They\r\nwere quite willing to teach him, but all they could say about it was,\r\n'You sit down on the top of the water in this way, and then you kick\r\nout like that.'  Peter tried it often, but always before he could kick\r\nout he sank.  What he really needed to know was how you sit on the\r\nwater without sinking, and they said it was quite impossible to explain\r\nsuch an easy thing as that.  Occasionally swans touched on the island,\r\nand he would give them all his day's food and then ask them how they\r\nsat on the water, but as soon as he had no more to give them the\r\nhateful things hissed at him and sailed away.\r\n\r\nOnce he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the Gardens.\r\nA wonderful white thing, like a runaway newspaper, floated high over\r\nthe island and then tumbled, rolling over and over after the manner of\r\na bird that has broken its wing.  Peter was so frightened that he hid,\r\nbut the birds told him it was only a kite, and what a kite is, and that\r\nit must have tugged its string out of a boy's hand, and soared away.\r\nAfter that they laughed at Peter for being so fond of the kite; he\r\nloved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it, and I think\r\nthis was pathetic and pretty, for the reason he loved it was because it\r\nhad belonged to a real boy.\r\n\r\nTo the birds this was a very poor reason, but the older ones felt\r\ngrateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of\r\nfledglings through the German measles, and they offered to show him how\r\nbirds fly a kite.  So six of them took the end of the string in their\r\nbeaks and flew away with it; and to his amazement it flew after them\r\nand went even higher than they.\r\n\r\nPeter screamed out, 'Do it again!' and with great good-nature they did\r\nit several times, and always instead of thanking them he cried, 'Do it\r\nagain!' which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it\r\nwas to be a boy.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a grand design burning within his brave heart, he begged\r\nthem to do it once more with him clinging to the tail, and now a\r\nhundred flew off with the string, and Peter clung to the tail, meaning\r\nto drop off when he was over the Gardens.  But the kite broke to pieces\r\nin the air, and he would have been drowned in the Serpentine had he not\r\ncaught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the\r\nisland.  After this the birds said that they would help him no more in\r\nhis mad enterprise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _After this the birds said that they would help him no\r\nmore in his mad enterprise._]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Peter did reach the Gardens at last by the help of\r\nShelley's boat, as I am now to tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE THRUSH'S NEST\r\n\r\nShelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to\r\nbe.  He was a poet; and they are never exactly grown-up.  They are\r\npeople who despise money except what you need for to-day, and he had\r\nall that and five pounds over.  So, when he was walking in the\r\nKensington Gardens, he made a paper boat of his bank-note, and sent it\r\nsailing on the Serpentine.\r\n\r\nIt reached the island at night; and the look-out brought it to Solomon\r\nCaw, who thought at first that it was the usual thing, a message from a\r\nlady, saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one.\r\nThey always ask for the best one he has, and if he likes the letter he\r\nsends one from Class A, but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones\r\nindeed.  Sometimes he sends none at all, and at another time he sends a\r\nnestful; it all depends on the mood you catch him in.  He likes you to\r\nleave it all to him, and if you mention particularly that you hope he\r\nwill see his way to making it _a boy this time_, he is almost sure to\r\nsend another girl.  And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who\r\nwants a baby-sister, always take pains to write your address clearly.\r\nYou can't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nShelley's boat, when opened, completely puzzled Solomon, and he took\r\ncounsel of his assistants, who having walked over it twice, first with\r\ntheir toes pointed out, and then with their toes pointed in, decided\r\nthat it came from some greedy person who wanted five.  They thought\r\nthis because there was a large five printed on it.  'Preposterous!'\r\ncried Solomon in a rage, and he presented it to Peter; anything useless\r\nwhich drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a plaything.\r\n\r\nBut he did not play with his precious bank-note, for he knew what it\r\nwas at once, having been very observant during the week when he was an\r\nordinary boy.  With so much money, he reflected, he could surely at\r\nlast contrive to reach the Gardens, and he considered all the possible\r\nways, and decided (wisely, I think) to choose the best way.  But,\r\nfirst, he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley's boat; and\r\nthough they were too honest to demand it back, he saw that they were\r\ngalled, and they cast such black looks at Solomon, who was rather vain\r\nof his cleverness, that he flew away to the end of the island, and sat\r\nthere very depressed with his head buried in his wings.  Now Peter knew\r\nthat unless Solomon was on your side, you never got anything done for\r\nyou in the island, so he followed him and tried to hearten him.\r\n\r\nNor was this all that Peter did to gain the powerful old fellow's\r\ngood-will.  You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in\r\noffice all his life.  He looked forward to retiring by and by, and\r\ndevoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump\r\nin the Figs which had taken his fancy, and for years he had been\r\nquietly filling his stocking.  It was a stocking belonging to some\r\nbathing person which had been cast upon the island, and at the time I\r\nspeak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs, thirty-four nuts,\r\nsixteen crusts, a pen-wiper, and a boot-lace.  When his stocking was\r\nfull, Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a\r\ncompetency.  Peter now gave him a pound.  He cut it off his bank-note\r\nwith a sharp stick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _For years he had been quietly filling his stocking._]\r\n\r\nThis made Solomon his friend for ever, and after the two had consulted\r\ntogether they called a meeting of the thrushes.  You will see presently\r\nwhy thrushes only were invited.\r\n\r\nThe scheme to be put before them was really Peter's, but Solomon did\r\nmost of the talking, because he soon became irritable if other people\r\ntalked.  He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the\r\nsuperior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building, and this put\r\nthem into good-humour at once, as it was meant to do; for all the\r\nquarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests.  Other\r\nbirds, said Solomon, omitted to line their nests with mud, and as a\r\nresult they did not hold water.  Here he cocked his head as if he had\r\nused an unanswerable argument; but, unfortunately, a Mrs. Finch had\r\ncome to the meeting uninvited, and she squeaked out, 'We don't build\r\nnests to hold water, but to hold eggs,' and then the thrushes stopped\r\ncheering, and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n'Consider,' he said at last, 'how warm the mud makes the nest.'\r\n\r\n'Consider,' cried Mrs. Finch, 'that when water gets into the nest it\r\nremains there and your little ones are drowned.'\r\n\r\nThe thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in\r\nreply to this, but again he was perplexed.\r\n\r\n'Try another drink,' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly.  Kate was her name,\r\nand all Kates are saucy.\r\n\r\nSolomon did try another drink, and it inspired him.  'If,' said he, 'a\r\nfinch's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces,\r\nbut a thrush's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan's back.'\r\n\r\nHow the thrushes applauded!  Now they knew why they lined their nests\r\nwith mud, and when Mrs. Finch called out, 'We don't place our nests on\r\nthe Serpentine,' they did what they should have done at first--chased\r\nher from the meeting.  After this it was most orderly.  What they had\r\nbeen brought together to hear, said Solomon, was this: their young\r\nfriend, Peter Pan, as they well knew, wanted very much to be able to\r\ncross to the Gardens, and he now proposed, with their help, to build a\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAt this the thrushes began to fidget, which made Peter tremble for his\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nSolomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the\r\ncumbrous boats that humans use; the proposed boat was to be simply a\r\nthrush's nest large enough to hold Peter.\r\n\r\nBut still, to Peter's agony, the thrushes were sulky.  'We are very\r\nbusy people,' they grumbled, 'and this would be a big job.'\r\n\r\n'Quite so,' said Solomon, 'and, of course, Peter would not allow you to\r\nwork for nothing.  You must remember that he is now in comfortable\r\ncircumstances, and he will pay you such wages as you have never been\r\npaid before.  Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid\r\nsixpence a day.'\r\n\r\nThen all the thrushes hopped for joy, and that very day was begun the\r\ncelebrated Building of the Boat.  All their ordinary business fell into\r\narrears.  It was the time of the year when they should have been\r\npairing, but not a thrush's nest was built except this big one, and so\r\nSolomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from\r\nthe mainland.  The stout, rather greedy children, who look so well in\r\nperambulators but get puffed easily when they walk, were all young\r\nthrushes once, and ladies often ask specially for them.  What do you\r\nthink Solomon did?  He sent over to the house-tops for a lot of\r\nsparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes' nests, and\r\nsent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes!  It\r\nwas known afterwards on the island as the Sparrow's Year; and so, when\r\nyou meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they\r\nthought themselves bigger than they are, very likely they belong to\r\nthat year.  You ask them.\r\n\r\nPeter was a just master, and paid his workpeople every evening.  They\r\nstood in rows on the branches, waiting politely while he cut the paper\r\nsixpences out of his bank-note, and presently he called the roll, and\r\nthen each bird, as the names were mentioned, flew down and got\r\nsixpence.  It must have been a fine sight.\r\n\r\nAnd at last, after months of labour, the boat was finished.  O the\r\nglory of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrushes\r\nnest!  From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its\r\nside, and often woke up to say sweet things to it, and after it was\r\nlined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it.  He sleeps\r\nin his nest still, and has a fascinating way of curling round in it,\r\nfor it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round\r\nlike a kitten.  It is brown inside, of course, but outside it is mostly\r\ngreen, being woven of grass and twigs, and when these wither or snap\r\nthe walls are thatched afresh.  There are also a few feathers here and\r\nthere, which came off the thrushes while they were building.\r\n\r\nThe other birds were extremely jealous, and said that the boat would\r\nnot balance on the water, but it lay most beautifully steady; they said\r\nthe water would come into it, but no water came into it.  Next they\r\nsaid that Peter had no oars, and this caused the thrushes to look at\r\neach other in dismay; but Peter replied that he had no need of oars,\r\nfor he had a sail, and with such a proud, happy face he produced a sail\r\nwhich he had fashioned out of his nightgown, and though it was still\r\nrather like a nightgown it made a lovely sail.  And that night, the\r\nmoon being full, and all the birds asleep, he did enter his coracle (as\r\nMaster Francis Pretty would have said) and depart out of the island.\r\nAnd first, he knew not why, he looked upward, with his hands clasped,\r\nand from that moment his eyes were pinned to the west.\r\n\r\nHe had promised the thrushes to begin by making short voyages, with\r\nthem as his guides, but far away he saw the Kensington Gardens\r\nbeckoning to him beneath the bridge, and he could not wait.  His face\r\nwas flushed, but he never looked back; there was an exultation in his\r\nlittle breast that drove out fear.  Was Peter the least gallant of the\r\nEnglish mariners who have sailed westward to meet the Unknown?\r\n\r\nAt first, his boat turned round and round, and he was driven back to\r\nthe place of his starting, whereupon he shortened sail, by removing one\r\nof the sleeves, and was forthwith carried backwards by a contrary\r\nbreeze, to his no small peril.  He now let go the sail, with the result\r\nthat he was drifted towards the far shore, where are black shadows he\r\nknew not the dangers of, but suspected them, and so once more hoisted\r\nhis nightgown and went roomer of the shadows until he caught a\r\nfavouring wind, which bore him westward, but at so great a speed that\r\nhe was like to be broke against the bridge.  Which, having avoided, he\r\npassed under the bridge and came, to his great rejoicing, within full\r\nsight of the delectable Gardens.  But having tried to cast anchor,\r\nwhich was a stone at the end of a piece of the kite-string, he found no\r\nbottom, and was fain to hold off, seeking for moorage; and, feeling his\r\nway, he buffeted against a sunken reef that cast him overboard by the\r\ngreatness of the shock, and he was near to being drowned, but clambered\r\nback into the vessel.  There now arose a mighty storm, accompanied by\r\nroaring of waters, such as he had never heard the like, and he was\r\ntossed this way and that, and his hands so numbed with the cold that he\r\ncould not close them.  Having escaped the danger of which, he was\r\nmercifully carried into a small bay, where his boat rode at peace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was not yet in safety; for, on pretending to\r\ndisembark, he found a multitude of small people drawn up on the shore\r\nto contest his landing, and shouting shrilly to him to be off, for it\r\nwas long past Lock-out Time.  This, with much brandishing of their\r\nholly-leaves, and also a company of them carried an arrow which some\r\nboy had left in the Gardens, and this they were prepared to use as a\r\nbattering-ram.\r\n\r\nThen Peter, who knew them for the fairies, called out that he was not\r\nan ordinary human and had no desire to do them displeasure, but to be\r\ntheir friend; nevertheless, having found a jolly harbour, he was in no\r\ntemper to draw off therefrom, and he warned them if they sought to\r\nmischief him to stand to their harms.\r\n\r\nSo saying, he boldly leapt ashore, and they gathered around him with\r\nintent to slay him, but there then arose a great cry among the women,\r\nand it was because they had now observed that his sail was a baby's\r\nnightgown.  Whereupon, they straightway loved him, and grieved that\r\ntheir laps were too small, the which I cannot explain, except by saying\r\nthat such is the way of women.  The men-fairies now sheathed their\r\nweapons on observing the behaviour of their women, on whose\r\nintelligence they set great store, and they led him civilly to their\r\nqueen, who conferred upon him the courtesy of the Gardens after\r\nLock-out Time, and henceforth Peter could go whither he chose, and the\r\nfairies had orders to put him in comfort.\r\n\r\nSuch was his first voyage to the Gardens, and you may gather from the\r\nantiquity of the language that it took place a long time ago.  But\r\nPeter never grows any older, and if we could be watching for him under\r\nthe bridge to-night (but, of course, we can't), I dare say we should\r\nsee him hoisting his nightgown and sailing or paddling towards us in\r\nthe Thrushes Nest.  When he sails, he sits down, but he stands up to\r\npaddle.  I shall tell you presently how he got his paddle.\r\n\r\nLong before the time for the opening of the gates comes he steals back\r\nto the island, for people must not see him (he is not so human as all\r\nthat), but this gives him hours for play, and he plays exactly as real\r\nchildren play.  At least he thinks so, and it is one of the pathetic\r\nthings about him that he often plays quite wrongly.\r\n\r\nYou see, he had no one to tell him how children really play, for the\r\nfairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk, and so know nothing,\r\nand though the birds pretended that they could tell him a great deal,\r\nwhen the time for telling came, it was wonderful how little they really\r\nknew.  They told him the truth about hide-and-seek, and he often plays\r\nit by himself, but even the ducks on the Round Pond could not explain\r\nto him what it is that makes the pond so fascinating to boys.  Every\r\nnight the ducks have forgotten all the events of the day, except the\r\nnumber of pieces of cake thrown to them.  They are gloomy creatures,\r\nand say that cake is not what it was in their young days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk._]\r\n\r\nSo Peter had to find out many things for himself.  He often played\r\nships at the Round Pond, but his ship was only a hoop which he had\r\nfound on the grass.  Of course, he had never seen a hoop, and he\r\nwondered what you play at with them, and decided that you play at\r\npretending they are boats.  This hoop always sank at once, but he waded\r\nin for it, and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the\r\npond, and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys\r\ndo with hoops.\r\n\r\nAnother time, when he found a child's pail, he thought it was for\r\nsitting in, and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of\r\nit.  Also he found a balloon.  It was bobbing about on the Hump, quite\r\nas if it was having a game by itself, and he caught it after an\r\nexciting chase.  But he thought it was a ball, and Jenny Wren had told\r\nhim that boys kick balls, so he kicked it; and after that he could not\r\nfind it anywhere.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator.  It was\r\nunder a lime-tree, near the entrance to the Fairy Queen's Winter Palace\r\n(which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts), and Peter\r\napproached it warily, for the birds had never mentioned such things to\r\nhim.  Lest it was alive, he addressed it politely; and then, as it gave\r\nno answer, he went nearer and felt it cautiously.  He gave it a little\r\npush, and it ran from him, which made him think it must be alive after\r\nall; but, as it had run from him, he was not afraid.  So he stretched\r\nout his hand to pull it to him, but this time it ran at him, and he was\r\nso alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat.  You\r\nmust not think, however, that he was a coward, for he came back next\r\nnight with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other, but the\r\nperambulator had gone, and he never saw any other one.  I have promised\r\nto tell you also about his paddle.  It was a child's spade which he had\r\nfound near St. Govor's Well, and he thought it was a paddle.\r\n\r\nDo you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes?  If so, I think it\r\nrather silly of you.  What I mean is that, of course, one must pity him\r\nnow and then, but to pity him all the time would be impertinence.  He\r\nthought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens, and to think you\r\nhave it is almost quite as good as really to have it.  He played\r\nwithout ceasing, while you often waste time by being mad-dog or\r\nMary-Annish.  He could be neither of these things, for he had never\r\nheard of them, but do you think he is to be pitied for that?\r\n\r\nOh, he was merry!  He was as much merrier than you, for instance, as\r\nyou are merrier than your father.  Sometimes he fell, like a\r\nspinning-top, and from sheer merriment.  Have you seen a greyhound\r\nleaping the fences of the Gardens?  That is how Peter leaps them.\r\n\r\nAnd think of the music of his pipe.  Gentlemen who walk home at night\r\nwrite to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens, but\r\nit is really Peter's pipe they hear.  Of course, he had no mother--at\r\nleast, what use was she to him!  You can be sorry for him for that, but\r\ndon't be too sorry, for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he\r\nrevisited her.  It was the fairies who gave him the chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLOCK-OUT TIME\r\n\r\nIt is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies, and almost\r\nthe only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever\r\nthere are children.  Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens, and\r\nat that time there was not a fairy in the place; then the children were\r\nadmitted, and the fairies came trooping in that very evening.  They\r\ncan't resist following the children, but you seldom see them, partly\r\nbecause they live in the daytime behind the railings, where you are not\r\nallowed to go, and also partly because they are so cunning.  They are\r\nnot a bit cunning after Lock-out, but until Lock-out, my word!\r\n\r\nWhen you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well, and you remember\r\na good deal about them in your babyhood, which it is a great pity you\r\ncan't write down, for gradually you forget, and I have heard of\r\nchildren who declared that they had never once seen a fairy.  Very\r\nlikely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens, they were standing\r\nlooking at a fairy all the time.  The reason they were cheated was that\r\nshe pretended to be something else.  This is one of their best tricks.\r\nThey usually pretend to be flowers, because the court sits in the\r\nFairies' Basin, and there are so many flowers there, and all along the\r\nBaby Walk, that a flower is the thing least likely to attract\r\nattention.  They dress exactly like flowers, and change with the\r\nseasons, putting on white when lilies are in and blue for bluebells,\r\nand so on.  They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all, as they are\r\npartial to a bit of colour, but tulips (except white ones, which are\r\nthe fairy cradles) they consider garish, and they sometimes put off\r\ndressing like tulips for days, so that the beginning of the tulip weeks\r\nis almost the best time to catch them.\r\n\r\nWhen they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively, but\r\nif you look, and they fear there is no time to hide, they stand quite\r\nstill pretending to be flowers.  Then, after you have passed without\r\nknowing that they were fairies, they rush home and tell their mothers\r\nthey have had such an adventure.  The Fairy Basin, you remember, is all\r\ncovered with ground-ivy (from which they make their castor oil), with\r\nflowers growing in it here and there.  Most of them really are flowers,\r\nbut some of them are fairies.  You never can be sure of them, but a\r\ngood plan is to walk by looking the other way, and then turn round\r\nsharply.  Another good plan, which David and I sometimes follow, is to\r\nstare them down.  After a long time they can't help winking, and then\r\nyou know for certain that they are fairies.\r\n\r\nThere are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk, which is a famous\r\ngentle place, as spots frequented by fairies are called.  Once\r\ntwenty-four of them had an extraordinary adventure.  They were a girls'\r\nschool out for a walk with the governess, and all wearing hyacinth\r\ngowns, when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth, and then they all\r\nstood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths.\r\nUnfortunately what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to\r\nplant new flowers in that very bed.  They were wheeling a hand-cart\r\nwith the flowers in it, and were quite surprised to find the bed\r\noccupied.  'Pity to lift them hyacinths,'  said the one man.  'Duke's\r\norders,' replied the other, and, having emptied the cart, they dug up\r\nthe boarding school and put the poor, terrified things in it in five\r\nrows.  Of course, neither the governess nor the girls dare let on that\r\nthey were fairies, so they were carted far away to a potting-shed, out\r\nof which they escaped in the night without their shoes, but there was a\r\ngreat row about it among the parents, and the school was ruined.\r\n\r\nAs for their houses, it is no use looking for them, because they are\r\nthe exact opposite of our houses.  You can see our houses by day but\r\nyou can't see them by dark.  Well, you can see their houses by dark,\r\nbut you can't see them by day, for they are the colour of night, and I\r\nnever heard of any one yet who could see night in the daytime.  This\r\ndoes not mean that they are black, for night has its colours just as\r\nday has, but ever so much brighter.  Their blues and reds and greens\r\nare like ours with a light behind them.  The palace is entirely built\r\nof many-coloured glasses, and it is quite the loveliest of all royal\r\nresidences, but the queen sometimes complains because the common people\r\nwill peep in to see what she is doing.  They are very inquisitive folk,\r\nand press quite hard against the glass, and that is why their noses are\r\nmostly snubby.  The streets are miles long and very twisty, and have\r\npaths on each side made of bright worsted.  The birds used to steal the\r\nworsted for their nests, but a policeman has been appointed to hold on\r\nat the other end.\r\n\r\nOne of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they\r\nnever do anything useful.  When the first baby laughed for the first\r\ntime, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping\r\nabout.  That was the beginning of fairies.  They look tremendously\r\nbusy, you know, as if they had not a moment to spare, but if you were\r\nto ask them what they are doing, they could not tell you in the least.\r\nThey are frightfully ignorant, and everything they do is make-believe.\r\nThey have a postman, but he never calls except at Christmas with his\r\nlittle box, and though they have beautiful schools, nothing is taught\r\nin them; the youngest child being chief person is always elected\r\nmistress, and when she has called the roll, they all go out for a walk\r\nand never come back.  It is a very noticeable thing that, in fairy\r\nfamilies, the youngest is always chief person, and usually becomes a\r\nprince or princess; and children remember this, and think it must be so\r\namong humans also; and that is why they are often made uneasy when they\r\ncome upon their mother furtively putting new frills on the basinette.\r\n\r\nYou have probably observed that your baby-sister wants to do all sorts\r\nof things that your mother and her nurse want her not to do--to stand\r\nup at sitting-down time, and to sit down at stand-up time, for\r\ninstance, or to wake up when she should fall asleep, or to crawl on the\r\nfloor when she is wearing her best frock, and so on, and perhaps you\r\nput this down to naughtiness.  But it is not; it simply means that she\r\nis doing as she has seen the fairies do; she begins by following their\r\nways, and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways.  Her\r\nfits of passion, which are awful to behold, and are usually called\r\nteething, are no such thing; they are her natural exasperation, because\r\nwe don't understand her, though she is talking an intelligible\r\nlanguage.  She is talking fairy.  The reason mothers and nurses know\r\nwhat her remarks mean, before other people know, as that 'Guch' means\r\n'Give it to me at once,' while 'Wa' is 'Why do you wear such a funny\r\nhat?' is because, mixing so much with babies, they have picked up a\r\nlittle of the fairy language.\r\n\r\nOf late David has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue, with\r\nhis hands clutching his temples, and he has remembered a number of\r\ntheir phrases which I shall tell you some day if I don't forget.  He\r\nhad heard them in the days when he was a thrush, and though I suggested\r\nto him that perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering, he\r\nsays not, for these phrases are about fun and adventures, and the birds\r\ntalked of nothing but nest-building.  He distinctly remembers that the\r\nbirds used to go from spot to spot like ladies at shop windows, looking\r\nat the different nests and saying, 'Not my colour, my dear,' and 'How\r\nwould that do with a soft lining?' and 'But will it wear?' and 'What\r\nhideous trimming!' and so on.\r\n\r\nThe fairies are exquisite dancers, and that is why one of the first\r\nthings the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry\r\nwhen you do it.  They hold their great balls in the open air, in what\r\nis called a fairy ring.  For weeks afterwards you can see the ring on\r\nthe grass.  It is not there when they begin, but they make it by\r\nwaltzing round and round.  Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the\r\nring, and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to\r\nclear away.  The chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks\r\nthese little people leave behind them, and they would remove even these\r\nwere they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment\r\nof the opening of the gates.  David and I once found a fairy ring quite\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nBut there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes\r\nplace.  You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to\r\nclose to-day.  Well, these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the\r\nboard on a ball night, so that it says the Gardens are to close at\r\nsix-thirty, for instance, instead of at seven.  This enables them to\r\nget begun half an hour earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _These tricky fairies sometimes change the board on a\r\nball night._]\r\n\r\nIf on such a night we could remain behind in the Gardens, as the famous\r\nMaimie Mannering did, we might see delicious sights; hundreds of lovely\r\nfairies hastening to the ball, the married ones wearing their wedding\r\nrings round their waists; the gentlemen, all in uniform, holding up the\r\nladies' trains, and linkmen running in front carrying winter cherries,\r\nwhich are the fairy-lanterns; the cloakroom where they put on their\r\nsilver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps; the flowers streaming\r\nup from the Baby Walk to look on, and always welcome because they can\r\nlend a pin; the supper-table, with Queen Mab at the head of it, and\r\nbehind her chair the Lord Chamberlain, who carries a dandelion on which\r\nhe blows when her Majesty wants to know the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _When her Majesty wants to know the time._]\r\n\r\nThe table-cloth varies according to the seasons, and in May it is made\r\nof chestnut blossom.  The way the fairy servants do is this: The men,\r\nscores of them, climb up the trees and shake the branches, and the\r\nblossom falls like snow.  Then the lady servants sweep it together by\r\nwhisking their skirts until it is exactly like a tablecloth, and that\r\nis how they get their tablecloth.\r\n\r\nThey have real glasses and real wine of three kinds, namely, blackthorn\r\nwine, berberris wine, and cowslip wine, and the Queen pours out, but\r\nthe bottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out.  There is\r\nbread-and-butter to begin with, of the size of a threepenny bit; and\r\ncakes to end with, and they are so small that they have no crumbs.  The\r\nfairies sit round on mushrooms, and at first they are well-behaved and\r\nalways cough off the table, and so on, but after a bit they are not so\r\nwell-behaved and stick their fingers into the butter, which is got from\r\nthe roots of old trees, and the really horrid ones crawl over the\r\ntablecloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues.  When\r\nthe Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and\r\nput away, and then everybody adjourns to the dance, the Queen walking\r\nin front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her, carrying two\r\nlittle pots, one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the\r\nother the juice of Solomon's seals.  Wallflower juice is good for\r\nreviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit, and Solomon's seals\r\njuice is for bruises.  They bruise very easily, and when Peter plays\r\nfaster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits.  For, as\r\nyou know without my telling you, Peter Pan is the fairies' orchestra.\r\nHe sits in the middle of the ring, and they would never dream of having\r\na smart dance nowadays without him.  'P. P.' is written on the corner\r\nof the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families.  They are\r\ngrateful little people, too, and at the princesses coming-of-age ball\r\n(they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every\r\nmonth) they gave him the wish of his heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Peter Pan is the fairies' orchestra._]\r\n\r\nThe way it was done was this.  The Queen ordered him to kneel, and then\r\nsaid that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his\r\nheart.  Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of\r\nhis heart, but for a long time he hesitated, not being certain what it\r\nwas himself.\r\n\r\n'If I chose to go back to mother,' he asked at last, 'could you give me\r\nthat wish?'\r\n\r\nNow this question vexed them, for were he to return to his mother they\r\nshould lose his music, so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and\r\nsaid, 'Pooh! ask for a much bigger wish than that.'\r\n\r\n'Is that quite a little wish?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n'As little as this,' the Queen answered, putting her hands near each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n'What size is a big wish?' he asked.\r\n\r\nShe measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length.\r\n\r\nThen Peter reflected and said, 'Well, then, I think I shall have two\r\nlittle wishes instead of one big one.'\r\n\r\nOf course, the fairies had to agree, though his cleverness rather\r\nshocked them, and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother,\r\nbut with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her\r\ndisappointing.  His second wish he would hold in reserve.\r\n\r\nThey tried to dissuade him, and even put obstacles in the way.\r\n\r\n'I can give you the power to fly to her house,' the Queen said, 'but I\r\ncan't open the door for you.'\r\n\r\n'The window I flew out at will be open,' Peter said confidently.\r\n'Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back.'\r\n\r\n'How do you know?' they asked, quite surprised, and, really, Peter\r\ncould not explain how he knew.\r\n\r\n'I just do know,' he said.\r\n\r\nSo as he persisted in his wish, they had to grant it.  The way they\r\ngave him power to fly was this: They all tickled him on the shoulder,\r\nand soon he felt a funny itching in that part, and then up he rose\r\nhigher and higher, and flew away out of the Gardens and over the\r\nhousetops.\r\n\r\nIt was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he\r\nskimmed away over St. Paul's to the Crystal Palace and back by the\r\nriver and Regent's Park, and by the time he reached his mother's window\r\nhe had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become\r\na bird.\r\n\r\nThe window was wide open, just as he knew it would be, and in he\r\nfluttered, and there was his mother lying asleep.  Peter alighted\r\nsoftly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at\r\nher.  She lay with her head on her hand, and the hollow in the pillow\r\nwas like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair.  He remembered, though\r\nhe had long forgotten it, that she always gave her hair a holiday at\r\nnight.  How sweet the frills of her nightgown were!  He was very glad\r\nshe was such a pretty mother.\r\n\r\nBut she looked sad, and he knew why she looked sad.  One of her arms\r\nmoved as if it wanted to go round something, and he knew what it wanted\r\nto go round.\r\n\r\n'O mother!' said Peter to himself, 'if you just knew who is sitting on\r\nthe rail at the foot of the bed.'\r\n\r\nVery gently he patted the little mound that her feet made, and he could\r\nsee by her face that she liked it.  He knew he had but to say 'Mother'\r\never so softly, and she would wake up.  They always wake up at once if\r\nit is you that says their name.  Then she would give such a joyous cry\r\nand squeeze him tight.  How nice that would be to him, but oh! how\r\nexquisitely delicious it would be to her.  That, I am afraid, is how\r\nPeter regarded it.  In returning to his mother he never doubted that he\r\nwas giving her the greatest treat a woman can have.  Nothing can be\r\nmore splendid, he thought, than to have a little boy of your own.  How\r\nproud of him they are! and very right and proper, too.\r\n\r\nBut why does Peter sit so long on the rail; why does he not tell his\r\nmother that he has come back?\r\n\r\nI quite shrink from the truth, which is that he sat there in two minds.\r\nSometimes he looked longingly at his mother, and sometimes he looked\r\nlongingly at the window.  Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy\r\nagain, but on the other hand, what times those had been in the Gardens!\r\nWas he so sure that he should enjoy wearing clothes again?  He popped\r\noff the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments.\r\nThey were still there, but he could not remember how you put them on.\r\nThe socks, for instance, were they worn on the hands or on the feet?\r\nHe was about to try one of them on his hand, when he had a great\r\nadventure.  Perhaps the drawer had creaked; at any rate, his mother\r\nwoke up, for he heard her say 'Peter,' as if it was the most lovely\r\nword in the language.  He remained sitting on the floor and held his\r\nbreath, wondering how she knew that he had come back.  If she said\r\n'Peter' again, he meant to cry 'Mother' and run to her.  But she spoke\r\nno more, she made little moans only, and when he next peeped at her she\r\nwas once more asleep, with tears on her face.\r\n\r\nIt made Peter very miserable, and what do you think was the first thing\r\nhe did?  Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed, he played a\r\nbeautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe.  He had made it up himself\r\nout of the way she said 'Peter,' and he never stopped playing until she\r\nlooked happy.\r\n\r\nHe thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening\r\nher to hear her say, 'O Peter, how exquisitely you play!'  However, as\r\nshe now seemed comfortable, he again cast looks at the window.  You\r\nmust not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back.  He\r\nhad quite decided to be his mother's boy, but hesitated about beginning\r\nto-night.  It was the second wish which troubled him.  He no longer\r\nmeant to make it a wish to be a bird, but not to ask for a second wish\r\nseemed wasteful, and, of course, he could not ask for it without\r\nreturning to the fairies.  Also, if he put off asking for his wish too\r\nlong it might go bad.  He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted\r\nto fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon.  'I should like awfully\r\nto sail in my boat just once more,' he said wistfully to his sleeping\r\nmother.  He quite argued with her as if she could hear him.  'It would\r\nbe so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure,' he said coaxingly.\r\n'I promise to come back,' he said solemnly, and meant it, too.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end, you know, he flew away.  Twice he came back from the\r\nwindow, wanting to kiss his mother, but he feared the delight of it\r\nmight waken her, so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe,\r\nand then he flew back to the Gardens.\r\n\r\nMany nights, and even months, passed before he asked the fairies for\r\nhis second wish; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so\r\nlong.  One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say, not only to\r\nhis particular friends, but to a hundred favourite spots.  Then he had\r\nhis last sail, and his very last sail, and his last sail of all, and so\r\non.  Again, a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour; and\r\nanother comfortable reason was that, after all, there was no hurry, for\r\nhis mother would never weary of waiting for him.  This last reason\r\ndispleased old Solomon, for it was an encouragement to the birds to\r\nprocrastinate.  Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them\r\nat their work, such as 'Never put off laying to-day because you can lay\r\nto-morrow,' and 'In this world there are no second chances,' and yet\r\nhere was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it.  The birds\r\npointed this out to each other, and fell into lazy habits.\r\n\r\nBut, mind you, though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother, he\r\nwas quite decided to go back.  The best proof of this was his caution\r\nwith the fairies.  They were most anxious that he should remain in the\r\nGardens to play to them, and to bring this to pass they tried to trick\r\nhim into making such a remark as 'I wish the grass was not so wet,' and\r\nsome of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry, 'I do\r\nwish you would keep time!'  Then they would have said that this was his\r\nsecond wish.  But he smoked their design, and though on occasions he\r\nbegan, 'I wish----' he always stopped in time.  So when at last he said\r\nto them bravely, 'I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always,'\r\nthey had to tickle his shoulders and let him go.\r\n\r\nHe went in a hurry in the end, because he had dreamt that his mother\r\nwas crying, and he knew what was the great thing she cried for, and\r\nthat a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile.\r\nOh! he felt sure of it, and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms\r\nthat this time he flew straight to the window, which was always to be\r\nopen for him.\r\n\r\nBut the window was closed, and there were iron bars on it, and peering\r\ninside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm around\r\nanother little boy.\r\n\r\nPeter called, 'Mother! mother!' but she heard him not; in vain he beat\r\nhis little limbs against the iron bars.  He had to fly back, sobbing,\r\nto the Gardens, and he never saw his dear again.  What a glorious boy\r\nhe had meant to be to her!  Ah, Peter! we who have made the great\r\nmistake, how differently we should all act at the second chance.  But\r\nSolomon was right--there is no second chance, not for most of us.  When\r\nwe reach the window it is Lock-out Time.  The iron bars are up for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE HOUSE\r\n\r\nEverybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens,\r\nwhich is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built\r\nfor humans.  But no one has really seen it, except just three or four,\r\nand they have not only seen it but slept in it, and unless you sleep in\r\nit you never see it.  This is because it is not there when you lie\r\ndown, but it is there when you wake up and step outside.\r\n\r\nIn a kind of way every one may see it, but what you see is not really\r\nit, but only the light in the windows.  You see the light after\r\nLock-out Time.  David, for instance, saw it quite distinctly far away\r\namong the trees as we were going home from the pantomime, and Oliver\r\nBailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple, which is the\r\nname of his father's office.  Angela Clare, who loves to have a tooth\r\nextracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop, saw more than\r\none light, she saw hundreds of them all together; and this must have\r\nbeen the fairies building the house, for they build it every night, and\r\nalways in a different part of the Gardens.  She thought one of the\r\nlights was bigger than the others, though she was not quite sure, for\r\nthey jumped about so, and it might have been another one that was\r\nbigger.  But if it was the same one, it was Peter Pan's light.  Heaps\r\nof children have seen the light, so that is nothing.  But Maimie\r\nMannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built.\r\n\r\nMaimie was always rather a strange girl, and it was at night that she\r\nwas strange.  She was four years of age, and in the daytime she was the\r\nordinary kind.  She was pleased when her brother Tony, who was a\r\nmagnificent fellow of six, took notice of her, and she looked up to him\r\nin the right way, and tried in vain to imitate him, and was flattered\r\nrather than annoyed when he shoved her about.  Also, when she was\r\nbatting, she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to\r\nyou that she was wearing new shoes.  She was quite the ordinary kind in\r\nthe daytime.\r\n\r\nBut as the shades of night fell, Tony, the swaggerer, lost his contempt\r\nfor Maimie and eyed her fearfully; and no wonder, for with dark there\r\ncame into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look.  It\r\nwas also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony's uneasy\r\nglances.  Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys (which\r\nhe always took away from her next morning), and she accepted them with\r\na disturbing smile.  The reason he was now become so wheedling and she\r\nso mysterious was (in brief) that they knew they were about to be sent\r\nto bed.  It was then that Maimie was terrible.  Tony entreated her not\r\nto do it to-night, and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened\r\nher, but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile.  And by and by when\r\nthey were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying\r\n'Hsh! what was that?'  Tony beseeches her, 'It was nothing--don't,\r\nMaimie, don't' and pulls the sheet over his head.  'It is coming\r\nnearer!' she cries.  'Oh, look at it, Tony!  It is feeling your bed\r\nwith its horns--it is boring for you, O Tony, oh!' and she desists not\r\nuntil he rushes downstairs in his combinations, screeching.  When they\r\ncame up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly--not\r\nshamming, you know, but really sleeping, and looking like the sweetest\r\nlittle angel, which seems to me to make it almost worse.\r\n\r\nBut of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens, and then\r\nTony did most of the talking.  You could gather from his talk that he\r\nwas a very brave boy, and no one was so proud of it as Maimie.  She\r\nwould have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his\r\nsister.  And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her,\r\nas he often did with splendid firmness, that one day he meant to remain\r\nbehind in the Gardens after the gates were closed.\r\n\r\n'O Tony,' she would say with awful respect, 'but the fairies will be so\r\nangry!'\r\n\r\n'I dare say,' replied Tony carelessly.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' she said, thrilling, 'Peter Pan will give you a sail in his\r\nboat!'\r\n\r\n'I shall make him,' replied Tony; no wonder she was proud of him.\r\n\r\nBut they should not have talked so loudly, for one day they were\r\noverheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves, from which\r\nthe little people weave their summer curtains, and after that Tony was\r\na marked boy.  They loosened the rails before he sat on them, so that\r\ndown he came on the back of his head; they tripped him up by catching\r\nhis bootlace, and bribed the ducks to sink his boat.  Nearly all the\r\nnasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies\r\nhave taken an ill-will to you, and so it behoves you to be careful what\r\nyou say about them.\r\n\r\nMaimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things, but\r\nTony was not that kind, and when she asked him which day he was to\r\nremain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied, 'Just\r\nsome day'; he was quite vague about which day except when she asked,\r\n'Will it be to-day?' and then he could always say for certain that it\r\nwould not be to-day.  So she saw that he was waiting for a real good\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow,\r\nand there was ice on the Round Pond; not thick enough to skate on, but\r\nat least you could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones, and many\r\nbright little boys and girls were doing that.\r\n\r\nWhen Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the\r\npond, but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first, and as she\r\nsaid this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed\r\nthat night.  It read half-past five.  Poor ayah! she is the one who\r\nlaughs continuously because there are so many white children in the\r\nworld, but she was not to laugh much more that day.\r\n\r\nWell, they went up the Baby Walk and back, and when they returned to\r\nthe time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock\r\nfor closing-time.  But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the\r\nfairies, and so did not see (as Maimie and Tony saw at once) that they\r\nhad changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night.  She said\r\nthere was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back, and as\r\nthey trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their\r\nlittle breasts.  You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball.\r\nNever, Tony felt, could he hope for a better chance.\r\n\r\nHe had to feel this for Maimie so plainly felt it for him.  Her eager\r\neyes asked the question, 'Is it to-day?' and he gasped and then nodded.\r\nMaimie slipped her hand into Tony's, and hers was hot, but his was\r\ncold.  She did a very kind thing; she took off her scarf and gave it to\r\nhim.  'In case you should feel cold,' she whispered.  Her face was\r\naglow, but Tony's was very gloomy.\r\n\r\nAs they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her, 'I'm afraid\r\nnurse would see me, so I shan't be able to do it.'\r\n\r\nMaimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their\r\nayah, when there were so many unknown terrors to fear, and she said\r\naloud, 'Tony, I shall race you to the gate,' and in a whisper, 'Then\r\nyou can hide,' and off they ran.\r\n\r\nTony could always outdistance her easily, but never had she known him\r\nspeed away so quickly as now, and she was sure he hurried that he might\r\nhave more time to hide.  'Brave, brave!' her doting eyes were crying\r\nwhen she got a dreadful shock; instead of hiding, her hero had run out\r\nat the gate!  At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly, as if all\r\nher lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled, and then for\r\nvery disdain she could not sob; in a swell of protest against all\r\npuling cowards she ran to St. Govor's Well and hid in Tony's stead.\r\n\r\nWhen the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought\r\nher other charge was with him and passed out.  Twilight crept over the\r\nGardens, and hundreds of people passed out, including the last one, who\r\nalways has to run for it, but Maimie saw them not.  She had shut her\r\neyes tight and glued them with passionate tears.  When she opened them\r\nsomething very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into\r\nher heart.  It was the stillness of the Gardens.  Then she heard\r\n_clang_, then from another part _clang_, then _clang, clang_ far away.\r\nIt was the Closing of the Gates.\r\n\r\nImmediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a\r\nvoice say, 'So that's all right.'  It had a wooden sound and seemed to\r\ncome from above, and she looked up in time to see an elm-tree\r\nstretching out its arms and yawning.\r\n\r\nShe was about to say, 'I never knew you could speak!' when a metallic\r\nvoice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the\r\nelm, 'I suppose it is a bit coldish up there?' and the elm replied,\r\n'Not particularly, but you do get numb standing so long on one leg,'\r\nand he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cab-men do before they\r\ndrive off.  Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other\r\ntall trees were doing the same sort of thing, and she stole away to the\r\nBaby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca holly which shrugged\r\nits shoulders but did not seem to mind her.\r\n\r\nShe was not in the least cold.  She was wearing a russet-coloured\r\npelisse and had the hood over her head, so that nothing of her showed\r\nexcept her dear little face and her curls.  The rest of her real self\r\nwas hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she\r\nseemed rather like a ball.  She was about forty round the waist.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk, where Maimie arrived\r\nin time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and\r\nset off for a smart walk.  They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly,\r\nbut that was because they used crutches.  An elderberry hobbled across\r\nthe walk, and stood chatting with some young quinces, and they all had\r\ncrutches.  The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees\r\nand shrubs.  They were quite familiar objects to Maimie, but she had\r\nnever known what they were for until to-night.\r\n\r\nShe peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy.  He was a street boy\r\nfairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees.  The way\r\nhe did it was this: he pressed a spring in the trunks and they shut\r\nlike umbrellas, deluging the little plants beneath with snow.  'O you\r\nnaughty, naughty child!' Maimie cried indignantly, for she knew what it\r\nwas to have a dripping umbrella about your ears.\r\n\r\nFortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot, but a\r\nchrysanthemum heard her, and said so pointedly, 'Hoity-toity, what is\r\nthis?' that she had to come out and show herself.  Then the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A chrysanthemum heard her, and said pointedly,\r\n\"Hoity-toity, what is this?\"_]\r\n\r\n'Of course it is no affair of ours,' a spindle-tree said after they had\r\nwhispered together, 'but you know quite well you ought not to be here,\r\nand perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies; what do you think\r\nyourself?'\r\n\r\n'I think you should not,' Maimie replied, which so perplexed them that\r\nthey said petulantly there was no arguing with her.  'I wouldn't ask it\r\nof you,' she assured them, 'if I thought it was wrong,' and of course\r\nafter this they could not well carry tales.  They then said,\r\n'Well-a-day,' and 'Such is life,' for they can be frightfully\r\nsarcastic; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches,\r\nand she said good-naturedly, 'Before I go to the fairies' ball, I\r\nshould like to take you for a walk one at a time; you can lean on me,\r\nyou know.'\r\n\r\nAt this they clapped their hands, and she escorted them up the Baby\r\nWalk and back again, one at a time, putting an arm or a finger round\r\nthe very frail, setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous, and\r\ntreating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the English, though\r\nshe could not understand a word they said.\r\n\r\nThey behaved well on the whole, though some whimpered that she had not\r\ntaken them as far as she took Nancy or Grace or Dorothy, and others\r\njagged her, but it was quite unintentional, and she was too much of a\r\nlady to cry out.  So much walking tired her, and she was anxious to be\r\noff to the ball, but she no longer felt afraid.  The reason she felt no\r\nmore fear was that it was now night-time, and in the dark, you\r\nremember, Maimie was always rather strange.\r\n\r\nThey were now loth to let her go, for, 'If the fairies see you,' they\r\nwarned her, 'they will mischief you--stab you to death, or compel you\r\nto nurse their children, or turn you into something tedious, like an\r\nevergreen oak.'  As they said this they looked with affected pity at an\r\nevergreen oak, for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens.\r\n\r\n'Oh, la!' replied the oak bitingly, 'how deliciously cosy it is to\r\nstand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures\r\nshivering.'\r\n\r\nThis made them sulky, though they had really brought it on themselves,\r\nand they drew for Maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that would\r\nface her if she insisted on going to the ball.\r\n\r\nShe learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual\r\ngood temper at present, the cause being the tantalising heart of the\r\nDuke of Christmas Daisies.  He was an Oriental fairy, very poorly of a\r\ndreadful complaint, namely, inability to love, and though he had tried\r\nmany ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them.\r\nQueen Mab, who rules in the Gardens, had been confident that her girls\r\nwould bewitch him, but alas! his heart, the doctor said, remained cold.\r\nThis rather irritating doctor, who was his private physician, felt the\r\nDuke's heart immediately after any lady was presented, and then always\r\nshook his bald head and murmured, 'Cold, quite cold.'  Naturally Queen\r\nMab felt disgraced, and first she tried the effect of ordering the\r\ncourt into tears for nine minutes, and then she blamed the Cupids and\r\ndecreed that they should wear fools' caps until they thawed the Duke's\r\nfrozen heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shook his bald head and murmured, \"Cold, quite cold.\"_]\r\n\r\n'How I should love to see the Cupids in their dear little fools' caps!'\r\nMaimie cried, and away she ran to look for them very recklessly, for\r\nthe Cupids hate to be laughed at.\r\n\r\nIt is always easy to discover where a fairies' ball is being held, as\r\nribbons are stretched between it and all the populous parts of the\r\nGardens, on which those invited may walk to the dance without wetting\r\ntheir pumps.  This night the ribbons were red, and looked very pretty\r\non the snow.\r\n\r\nMaimie walked alongside one of them for some distance without meeting\r\nanybody, but at last she saw a fairy cavalcade approaching.  To her\r\nsurprise they seemed to be returning from the ball, and she had just\r\ntime to hide from them by bending her knees and holding out her arms\r\nand pretending to be a garden chair.  There were six horsemen in front\r\nand six behind; in the middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train\r\nheld up by two pages, and on the train, as if it were a couch, reclined\r\na lovely girl, for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about.\r\nShe was dressed in golden rain, but the most enviable part of her was\r\nher neck, which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture, and of\r\ncourse showed off her diamond necklace as no white throat could have\r\nglorified it.  The high-born fairies obtain this admired effect by\r\npricking their skin, which lets the blue blood come through and dye\r\nthem, and you cannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen\r\nthe ladies' busts in the jewellers' windows.\r\n\r\nMaimie also noticed that the whole cavalcade seemed to be in a passion,\r\ntilting their noses higher than it can be safe for even fairies to tilt\r\nthem, and she concluded that this must be another case in which the\r\ndoctor had said 'Cold, quite cold.'\r\n\r\nWell, she followed the ribbon to a place where it became a bridge over\r\na dry puddle into which another fairy had fallen and been unable to\r\nclimb out.  At first this little damsel was afraid of Maimie, who most\r\nkindly went to her aid, but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and\r\nexplaining that her name was Brownie, and that though only a poor\r\nstreet singer she was on her way to the ball to see if the Duke would\r\nhave her.\r\n\r\n'Of course,' she said, 'I am rather plain,' and this made Maimie\r\nuncomfortable, for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite\r\nplain for a fairy.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to know what to reply.\r\n\r\n'I see you think I have no chance,' Brownie said falteringly.\r\n\r\n'I don't say that,' Maimie answered politely; 'of course your face is\r\njust a tiny bit homely, but----'  Really it was quite awkward for her.\r\n\r\nFortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar.  He had\r\ngone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in\r\nLondon were on view for half a crown the second day, but on his return\r\nhome, instead of being dissatisfied with Maimie's mother, he had said,\r\n'You can't think, my dear, what a relief it is to see a homely face\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nMaimie repeated this story, and it fortified Brownie tremendously,\r\nindeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the Duke would choose\r\nher.  So she scudded away up the ribbon, calling out to Maimie not to\r\nfollow lest the Queen should mischief her.\r\n\r\nBut Maimie's curiosity tugged her forward, and presently at the seven\r\nSpanish chestnuts she saw a wonderful light.  She crept forward until\r\nshe was quite near it, and then she peeped from behind a tree.\r\n\r\nThe light, which was as high as your head above the ground, was\r\ncomposed of myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other, and so\r\nforming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring.  There were thousands of\r\nlittle people looking on, but they were in shadow and drab in colour\r\ncompared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle, who\r\nwere so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time\r\nshe looked at them.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas\r\nDaisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment: yet out of\r\nlove his dusky grace still was: you could see it by the shamed looks of\r\nthe Queen and court (though they pretended not to care), by the way\r\ndarling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as\r\nthey were told to pass on, and by his own most dreary face.\r\n\r\nMaimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke's heart and\r\nhear him give utterance to his parrot cry, and she was particularly\r\nsorry for the Cupids, who stood in their fools' caps in obscure places\r\nand, every time they heard that 'Cold, quite cold,' bowed their\r\ndisgraced little heads.\r\n\r\nShe was disappointed not to see Peter Pan, and I may as well tell you\r\nnow why he was so late that night.  It was because his boat had got\r\nwedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice, through which\r\nhe had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle.\r\n\r\nThe fairies had as yet scarcely missed him, for they could not dance,\r\nso heavy were their hearts.  They forget all the steps when they are\r\nsad, and remember them again when they are merry.  David tells me that\r\nfairies never say, 'We feel happy': what they say is, 'We feel\r\n_dancey_.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fairies never say, \"We feel happy\"; what they say is,\r\n\"We feel_ dancey_.\"_]\r\n\r\nWell, they were looking very undancey indeed, when sudden laughter\r\nbroke out among the onlookers, caused by Brownie, who had just arrived\r\nand was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Looking very undancey indeed._]\r\n\r\nMaimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared, though she\r\nhad really no hope; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie\r\nherself, who, however, was absolutely confident.  She was led before\r\nhis grace, and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal\r\nheart, which for convenience' sake was reached by a little trap-door in\r\nhis diamond shirt, had begun to say mechanically, 'Cold, qui--,' when\r\nhe stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n'What's this,' he cried, and first he shook the heart like a watch, and\r\nthen he put his ear to it.\r\n\r\n'Bless my soul!' cried the doctor, and by this time of course the\r\nexcitement among the spectators was tremendous, fairies fainting right\r\nand left.\r\n\r\nEverybody stared breathlessly at the Duke, who was very much startled,\r\nand looked as if he would like to run away.  'Good gracious me!' the\r\ndoctor was heard muttering, and now the heart was evidently on fire,\r\nfor he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was awful.\r\n\r\nThen in a loud voice, and bowing low, 'My Lord Duke,' said the\r\nphysician elatedly, 'I have the honour to inform your excellency that\r\nyour grace is in love.'\r\n\r\nYou can't conceive the effect of it.  Brownie held out her arms to the\r\nDuke and he flung himself into them, the Queen leapt into the arms of\r\nthe Lord Chamberlain, and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms\r\nof her gentlemen, for it is etiquette to follow her example in\r\neverything.  Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place,\r\nfor if you leap into each other's arms it is a fairy wedding.  Of\r\ncourse a clergyman has to be present.\r\n\r\nHow the crowd cheered and leapt!  Trumpets brayed, the moon came out,\r\nand immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they\r\nwere ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy\r\nring.  Most gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools'\r\ncaps from their heads and cast them high in the air.  And then Maimie\r\nwent and spoiled everything.\r\n\r\nShe could n't help it.  She was crazy with delight over her little\r\nfriend's good fortune, so she took several steps forward and cried in\r\nan ecstasy, 'O Brownie, how splendid!'\r\n\r\nEverybody stood still, the music ceased, the lights went out, and all\r\nin the time you may take to say, 'Oh dear!'  An awful sense of her\r\nperil came upon Maimie; too late she remembered that she was a lost\r\nchild in a place where no human must be between the locking and the\r\nopening of the gates; she heard the murmur of an angry multitude; she\r\nsaw a thousand swords flashing for her blood, and she uttered a cry of\r\nterror and fled.\r\n\r\nHow she ran! and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head.\r\nMany times she lay down, and then quickly jumped up and ran on again.\r\nHer little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she\r\nwas in the Gardens.  The one thing she was sure of was that she must\r\nnever cease to run, and she thought she was still running long after\r\nshe had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep.  She thought the\r\nsnowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night.\r\nShe thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket, and tried to pull\r\nit over her head.  And when she heard talking through her dreams she\r\nthought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at\r\nher as she slept.  But it was the fairies.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to\r\nmischief her.  When she rushed away they had rent the air with such\r\ncries as 'Slay her!' 'Turn her into something extremely unpleasant!'\r\nand so on, but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should\r\nmarch in front, and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself\r\nbefore the Queen and demand a boon.\r\n\r\nEvery bride has a right to a boon, and what she asked for was Maimie's\r\nlife.  'Anything except that,' replied Queen Mab sternly, and all the\r\nfairies echoed, 'Anything except that.'  But when they learned how\r\nMaimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to\r\ntheir great glory and renown, they gave three huzzas for the little\r\nhuman, and set off, like an army, to thank her, the court advancing in\r\nfront and the canopy keeping step with it.  They traced Maimie easily\r\nby her footprints in the snow.\r\n\r\nBut though they found her deep in snow in the Figs, it seemed\r\nimpossible to thank Maimie, for they could not waken her.  They went\r\nthrough the form of thanking her--that is to say, the new King stood on\r\nher body and read her a long address of welcome, but she heard not a\r\nword of it.  They also cleared the snow off her, but soon she was\r\ncovered again, and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold.\r\n\r\n'Turn her into something that does not mind the cold,' seemed a good\r\nsuggestion of the doctors, but the only thing they could think of that\r\ndoes not mind cold was a snowflake.  'And it might melt,' the Queen\r\npointed out, so that idea had to be given up.\r\n\r\nA magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot, but\r\nthough there were so many of them she was too heavy.  By this time all\r\nthe ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs, but presently the Cupids\r\nhad a lovely idea.  'Build a house round her,' they cried, and at once\r\neverybody perceived that this was the thing to do; in a moment a\r\nhundred fairy sawyers were among the branches, architects were running\r\nround Maimie, measuring her; a bricklayer's yard sprang up at her feet,\r\nseventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation-stone, and the Queen\r\nlaid it, overseers were appointed to keep the boys off, scaffoldings\r\nwere run up, the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and\r\nturning-lathes, and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were\r\nputting in the windows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Building the house for Maimie._]\r\n\r\nThe house was exactly the size of Maimie, and perfectly lovely.  One of\r\nher arms was extended, and this had bothered them for a second, but\r\nthey built a verandah round it leading to the front door.  The windows\r\nwere the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller,\r\nbut it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof.  The\r\nfairies, as is their custom, clapped their hands with delight over\r\ntheir cleverness, and they were so madly in love with the little house\r\nthat they could not bear to think they had finished it.  So they gave\r\nit ever so many little extra touches, and even then they added more\r\nextra touches.\r\n\r\nFor instance, two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney.\r\n\r\n'Now we fear it is quite finished,' they sighed.\r\n\r\nBut no, for another two ran up the ladder, and tied some smoke to the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\n'That certainly finishes it,' they said reluctantly.\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' cried a glow-worm; 'if she were to wake without seeing a\r\nnight-light she might be frightened, so I shall be her night-light.'\r\n\r\n'Wait one moment,' said a china merchant, 'and I shall make you a\r\nsaucer.'\r\n\r\nNow, alas! it was absolutely finished.\r\n\r\nOh, dear no!\r\n\r\n'Gracious me!' cried a brass manufacturer, 'there's no handle on the\r\ndoor,' and he put one on.\r\n\r\nAn ironmonger added a scraper, and an old lady ran up with a door-mat.\r\nCarpenters arrived with a water-butt, and the painters insisted on\r\npainting it.\r\n\r\nFinished at last!\r\n\r\n'Finished!  How can it be finished,' the plumber demanded scornfully,\r\n'before hot and cold are put in,' and he put in hot and cold.  Then an\r\narmy of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and\r\nbulbs and forcing-houses, and soon they had a flower-garden to the\r\nright of the verandah, and a vegetable garden to the left, and roses\r\nand clematis on the walls of the house, and in less time than five\r\nminutes all these dear things were in full bloom.\r\n\r\nOh, how beautiful the little house was now!  But it was at last\r\nfinished true as true, and they had to leave it and return to the\r\ndance.  They all kissed their hands to it as they went away, and the\r\nlast to go was Brownie.  She stayed a moment behind the others to drop\r\na pleasant dream down the chimney.\r\n\r\nAll through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the\r\nFigs taking care of Maimie, and she never knew.  She slept until the\r\ndream was quite finished, and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as\r\nmorning was breaking from its egg, and then she almost fell asleep\r\nagain, and then she called out, 'Tony,' for she thought she was at home\r\nin the nursery.  As Tony made no answer she sat up, whereupon her head\r\nhit the roof, and it opened like the lid of a box, and to her\r\nbewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep\r\nin snow.  As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was\r\nreally herself, so she pinched her cheeks, and then she knew it was\r\nherself, and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great\r\nadventure.  She remembered now everything that had happened to her from\r\nthe closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies, but\r\nhowever, she asked herself, had she got into this funny place?  She\r\nstepped out by the roof, right over the garden, and then she saw the\r\ndear house in which she had passed the night.  It so entranced her that\r\nshe could think of nothing else.\r\n\r\n'O you darling!  O you sweet!  O you love!' she cried.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it now knew\r\nthat its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began\r\nto grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it\r\nwas shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now.  It\r\nalways remained as complete as ever, but it became smaller and smaller,\r\nand the garden dwindled at the same time, and the snow crept closer,\r\nlapping house and garden up.  Now the house was the size of a little\r\ndog's kennel, and now of a Noah's Ark, but still you could see the\r\nsmoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall, every one\r\ncomplete.  The glow-worm light was waning too, but it was still there.\r\n'Darling, loveliest, don't go!' Maimie cried, falling on her knees, for\r\nthe little house was now the size of a reel of thread, but still quite\r\ncomplete.  But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept\r\nup on all sides until it met itself, and where the little house had\r\nbeen was now one unbroken expanse of snow.\r\n\r\nMaimie stamped her foot naughtily, and was putting her fingers to her\r\neyes, when she heard a kind voice say, 'Don't cry, pretty human, don't\r\ncry,' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy\r\nregarding her wistfully.  She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nPETER'S GOAT\r\n\r\nMaimie felt quite shy, but Peter knew not what shy was.\r\n\r\n'I hope you have had a good night,' he said earnestly.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' she replied, 'I was so cosy and warm.  But you'--and she\r\nlooked at his nakedness awkwardly--'don't you feel the least bit cold?'\r\n\r\nNow cold was another word Peter had forgotten, so he answered, 'I think\r\nnot, but I may be wrong: you see I am rather ignorant.  I am not\r\nexactly a boy; Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between.'\r\n\r\n'So that is what it is called,' said Maimie thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'That's not my name,' he explained, 'my name is Peter Pan.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, of course,' she said, 'I know, everybody knows.'\r\n\r\nYou can't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people\r\noutside the gates knew about him.  He begged Maimie to tell him what\r\nthey knew and what they said, and she did so.  They were sitting by\r\nthis time on a fallen tree; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie,\r\nbut he sat on a snowy bit himself.\r\n\r\n'Squeeze closer,' Maimie said.\r\n\r\n'What is that?' he asked, and she showed him, and then he did it.  They\r\ntalked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him,\r\nbut not everything, not that he had gone back to his mother and been\r\nbarred out, for instance, and he said nothing of this to Maimie, for it\r\nstill humiliated him.\r\n\r\n'Do they know that I play games exactly like real boys?' he asked very\r\nproudly.  'O Maimie, please tell them!'  But when he revealed how he\r\nplayed, by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond, and so on, she was\r\nsimply horrified.\r\n\r\n'All your ways of playing,' she said with her big eyes on him, 'are\r\nquite, quite wrong, and not in the least like how boys play.'\r\n\r\nPoor Peter uttered a little moan at this, and he cried for the first\r\ntime for I know not how long.  Maimie was extremely sorry for him, and\r\nlent him her handkerchief, but he didn't know in the least what to do\r\nwith it, so she showed him, that is to say, she wiped her eyes, and\r\nthen gave it back to him, saying, 'Now you do it,' but instead of\r\nwiping his own eyes he wiped hers, and she thought it best to pretend\r\nthat this was what she had meant.\r\n\r\nShe said out of pity for him, 'I shall give you a kiss if you like,'\r\nbut though he once knew, he had long forgotten what kisses are, and he\r\nreplied, 'Thank you,' and held out his hand, thinking she had offered\r\nto put something into it.  This was a great shock to her, but she felt\r\nshe could not explain without shaming him, so with charming delicacy\r\nshe gave Peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket, and\r\npretended that it was a kiss.  Poor little boy! he quite believed her,\r\nand to this day he wears it on his finger, though there can be scarcely\r\nany one who needs a thimble so little.  You see, though still a tiny\r\nchild, it was really years and years since he had seen his mother, and\r\nI dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers.\r\n\r\nBut you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to\r\nadmire; if Maimie began by thinking this, she soon found she was very\r\nmuch mistaken.  Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of\r\nhis adventures, especially of how he went to and fro between the island\r\nand the Gardens in the Thrush's Nest:\r\n\r\n'How romantic!' Maimie exclaimed, but this was another unknown word,\r\nand he hung his head thinking she was despising him.\r\n\r\n'I suppose Tony would not have done that?' he said very humbly.\r\n\r\n'Never, never!' she answered with conviction, 'he would have been\r\nafraid.'\r\n\r\n'What is afraid?' asked Peter longingly.  He thought it must be some\r\nsplendid thing.  'I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid,\r\nMaimie,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I believe no one could teach that to you,' she answered adoringly, but\r\nPeter thought she meant that he was stupid.  She had told him about\r\nTony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him (she\r\nknew quite well that it was wicked), but Peter misunderstood her\r\nmeaning and said, 'Oh, how I wish I was as brave as Tony!'\r\n\r\nIt quite irritated her.  'You are twenty thousand times braver than\r\nTony,' she said; 'you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew.'\r\n\r\nHe could scarcely believe she meant it, but when he did believe he\r\nscreamed with joy.\r\n\r\n'And if you want very much to give me a kiss,' Maimie said, 'you can do\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nVery reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger.  He\r\nthought she wanted it back.\r\n\r\n'I don't mean a kiss,' she said hurriedly, 'I mean a thimble.'\r\n\r\n'What's that?' Peter asked.\r\n\r\n'It's like this,' she said, and kissed him.\r\n\r\n'I should love to give you a thimble,' Peter said gravely, so he gave\r\nher one.  He gave her quite a number of thimbles, and then a delightful\r\nidea came into his head.  'Maimie,' he said, 'will you marry me?'\r\n\r\nNow, strange to tell, the same idea had come at exactly the same time\r\ninto Maimie's head.  'I should like to,' she answered, 'but will there\r\nbe room in your boat for two?'\r\n\r\n'If you squeeze close,' he said eagerly.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps the birds would be angry?'\r\n\r\nHe assured her that the birds would love to have her, though I am not\r\nso certain of it myself.  Also that there were very few birds in\r\nwinter.  'Of course they might want your clothes,' he had to admit\r\nrather falteringly.\r\n\r\nShe was somewhat indignant at this.\r\n\r\n'They are always thinking of their nests,' he said apologetically, 'and\r\nthere are some bits of you'--he stroked the fur on her pelisse--'that\r\nwould excite them very much.'\r\n\r\n'They shan't have my fur,' she said sharply.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, still fondling it, however, 'no.  O Maimie,' he said\r\nrapturously, 'do you know why I love you?  It is because you are like a\r\nbeautiful nest.'\r\n\r\nSomehow this made her uneasy.  'I think you are speaking more like a\r\nbird than a boy now,' she said, holding back, and indeed he was even\r\nlooking rather like a bird.  'After all,' she said, 'you are only a\r\nBetwixt-and-Between.'  But it hurt him so much that she immediately\r\nadded, 'It must be a delicious thing to be.'\r\n\r\n'Come and be one, then, dear Maimie,' he implored her, and they set off\r\nfor the boat, for it was now very near Open-Gate time.  'And you are\r\nnot a bit like a nest,' he whispered to please her.\r\n\r\n'But I think it is rather nice to be like one,' she said in a woman's\r\ncontradictory way.  'And, Peter, dear, though I can't give them my fur,\r\nI wouldn't mind their building in it.  Fancy a nest in my neck with\r\nlittle spotty eggs in it!  O Peter, how perfectly lovely!'\r\n\r\nBut as they drew near the Serpentine, she shivered a little, and said,\r\n'Of course I shall go and see mother often, quite often.  It is not as\r\nif I was saying good-bye for ever to mother, it is not in the least\r\nlike that.'\r\n\r\n'Oh no,' answered Peter, but in his heart he knew it was very like\r\nthat, and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear\r\nof losing her.  He was so fond of her, he felt he could not live\r\nwithout her.  'She will forget her mother in time, and be happy with\r\nme,' he kept saying to himself, and he hurried her on, giving her\r\nthimbles by the way.\r\n\r\nBut even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its\r\nloveliness, she still talked tremblingly about her mother.  'You know\r\nquite well, Peter, don't you,' she said, 'that I wouldn't come unless I\r\nknew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to?  Peter,\r\nsay it.'\r\n\r\nHe said it, but he could no longer look her in the face.\r\n\r\n'If you are sure your mother will always want you,' he added rather\r\nsourly.\r\n\r\n'The idea of mother's not always wanting me!' Maimie cried, and her\r\nface glistened.\r\n\r\n'If she doesn't bar you out,' said Peter huskily.\r\n\r\n'The door,' replied Maimie, 'will always, always be open, and mother\r\nwill always be waiting at it for me.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' said Peter, not without grimness, 'step in, if you feel so sure\r\nof her,' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush's Nest.\r\n\r\n'But why don't you look at me?' she asked, taking him by the arm.\r\n\r\nPeter tried hard not to look, he tried to push off, then he gave a\r\ngreat gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow.\r\n\r\nShe went to him.  'What is it, dear, dear Peter?' she said, wondering.\r\n\r\n'O Maimie,' he cried, 'it isn't fair to take you with me if you think\r\nyou can go back!  Your mother'--he gulped again--'you don't know them\r\nas well as I do.'\r\n\r\nAnd then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out,\r\nand she gasped all the time.  'But my mother,' she said, '_my_\r\nmother----'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she would,' said Peter, 'they are all the same.  I dare say she\r\nis looking for another one already.'\r\n\r\nMaimie said aghast, 'I can't believe it.  You see, when you went away\r\nyour mother had none, but my mother has Tony, and surely they are\r\nsatisfied when they have one.'\r\n\r\nPeter replied bitterly, 'You should see the letters Solomon gets from\r\nladies who have six.'\r\n\r\nJust then they heard a grating creak, followed by _creak, creak_, all\r\nround the Gardens.  It was the Opening of the Gates, and Peter jumped\r\nnervously into his boat.  He knew Maimie would not come with him now,\r\nand he was trying bravely not to cry.  But Maimie was sobbing painfully.\r\n\r\n'If I should be too late,' she said in agony, 'O Peter, if she has got\r\nanother one already!'\r\n\r\nAgain he sprang ashore as if she had called him back.  'I shall come\r\nand look for you to-night,' he said, squeezing close, 'but if you hurry\r\naway I think you will be in time.'\r\n\r\nThen he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth, and covered\r\nhis face with his hands so that he might not see her go.\r\n\r\n'Dear Peter!' she cried.\r\n\r\n'Dear Maimie!' cried the tragic boy.\r\n\r\nShe leapt into his arms, so that it was a sort of fairy wedding, and\r\nthen she hurried away.  Oh, how she hastened to the gates!  Peter, you\r\nmay be sure, was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out\r\nsounded, but he found no Maimie, and so he knew she had been in time.\r\nFor long he hoped that some night she would come back to him; often he\r\nthought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as\r\nhis bark drew to land, but Maimie never went back.  She wanted to, but\r\nshe was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she\r\nwould linger with him too long, and besides the ayah now kept a sharp\r\neye on her.  But she often talked lovingly of Peter, and she knitted a\r\nkettle-holder for him, and one day when she was wondering what Easter\r\npresent he would like, her mother made a suggestion.\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' she said thoughtfully, 'would be so useful to him as a goat.'\r\n\r\n'He could ride on it,' cried Maimie, 'and play on his pipe at the same\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' her mother asked, 'won't you give him your goat, the one you\r\nfrighten Tony with at night?'\r\n\r\n'But it isn't a real goat,' Maimie said.\r\n\r\n'It seems very real to Tony,' replied her mother.\r\n\r\n'It seems frightfully real to me too,' Maimie admitted, 'but how could\r\nI give it to Peter?'\r\n\r\nHer mother knew a way, and next day, accompanied by Tony (who was\r\nreally quite a nice boy, though of course he could not compare), they\r\nwent to the Gardens, and Maimie stood alone within a fairy ring, and\r\nthen her mother, who was a rather gifted lady, said--\r\n\r\n  _'My daughter, tell me, if you can,\r\n  What have you got for Peter Pan?'_\r\n\r\nTo which Maimie replied--\r\n\r\n  _'I have a goat for him to ride,\r\n  Observe me cast it far and wide.'_\r\n\r\nShe then flung her arms about as if she were sowing seed, and turned\r\nround three times.\r\n\r\nNext Tony said--\r\n\r\n  _'If P. doth find it waiting here,\r\n  Wilt ne'er again make me to fear?'_\r\n\r\nAnd Maimie answered--\r\n\r\n  _'By dark or light I fondly swear\r\n  Never to see goats anywhere.'_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe also left a letter to Peter in a likely place, explaining what she\r\nhad done, and begging him to ask the fairies to turn the goat into one\r\nconvenient for riding on.  Well, it all happened just as she hoped, for\r\nPeter found the letter, and of course nothing could be easier for the\r\nfairies than to turn the goat into a real one, and so that is how Peter\r\ngot the goat on which he now rides round the Gardens every night\r\nplaying sublimely on his pipe.  And Maimie kept her promise, and never\r\nfrightened Tony with a goat again, though I have heard that she created\r\nanother animal.  Until she was quite a big girl she continued to leave\r\npresents for Peter in the Gardens (with letters explaining how humans\r\nplay with them), and she is not the only one who has done this.  David\r\ndoes it, for instance, and he and I know the likeliest place for\r\nleaving them in, and we shall tell you if you like, but for mercy's\r\nsake don't ask us before Porthos, for he is so fond of toys that, were\r\nhe to find out the place, he would take every one of them.\r\n\r\nThough Peter still remembers Maimie he is become as gay as ever, and\r\noften in sheer happiness he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily\r\non the grass.  Oh, he has a joyful time!  But he has still a vague\r\nmemory that he was a human once, and it makes him especially kind to\r\nthe house-swallows when they visit the island, for house-swallows are\r\nthe spirits of little children who have died.  They always build in the\r\neaves of the houses where they lived when they were humans, and\r\nsometimes they try to fly in at a nursery window, and perhaps that is\r\nwhy Peter loves them best of all the birds.\r\n\r\nAnd the little house?  Every lawful night (that is to say, every night\r\nexcept ball nights) the fairies now build the little house lest there\r\nshould be a human child lost in the Gardens, and Peter rides the\r\nmarches looking for lost ones, and if he finds them he carries them on\r\nhis goat to the little house, and when they wake up they are in it, and\r\nwhen they step out they see it.  The fairies build the house merely\r\nbecause it is so pretty, but Peter rides round in memory of Maimie, and\r\nbecause he still loves to do just as he believes real boys would do.\r\n\r\nBut you must not think that, because somewhere among the trees the\r\nlittle house is twinkling, it is a safe thing to remain in the Gardens\r\nafter Lock-out time.  If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be\r\nout that night they will certainly mischief you, and even though they\r\nare not, you may perish of cold and dark before Peter Pan comes round.\r\nHe has been too late several times, and when he sees he is too late he\r\nruns back to the Thrush's Nest for his paddle, of which Maimie had told\r\nhim the true use, and he digs a grave for the child and erects a little\r\ntombstone, and carves the poor thing's initials on it.  He does this at\r\nonce because he thinks it is what real boys would do, and you must have\r\nnoticed the little stones, and that there are always two together.  He\r\nputs them in twos because they seem less lonely.  I think that quite\r\nthe most touching sight in the Gardens is the two tombstones of Walter\r\nStephen Matthews and Phoebe Phelps.  They stand together at the spot\r\nwhere the parish of Westminster St. Mary's is said to meet the Parish\r\nof Paddington.  Here Peter found the two babes, who had fallen\r\nunnoticed from their perambulators, Phoebe aged thirteen months and\r\nWalter probably still younger, for Peter seems to have felt a delicacy\r\nabout putting any age on his stone.  They lie side by side, and the\r\nsimple inscriptions read\r\n\r\n    +---------+       +---------+\r\n    |   W.    |       |   13a   |\r\n    | St. M.  |  and  |  P. P.  |\r\n    |         |       |  1841.  |\r\n    +---------+       +---------+\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid sometimes places white flowers on these two innocent graves.\r\n\r\nBut how strange for parents, when they hurry into the Gardens at the\r\nopening of the gates looking for their lost one, to find the sweetest\r\nlittle tombstone instead.  I do hope that Peter is not too ready with\r\nhis spade.  It is all rather sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rear cover art]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, by J. M. Barrie",
