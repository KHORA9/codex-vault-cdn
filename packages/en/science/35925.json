Protozoa, the name selected\r\nfor this enormous class being that given by A. D'Orbigny in 1826 to the\r\nshells characteristic of the majority of the species. He regarded them\r\nas minute Cephalopods, whose chambers communicated by pores (foramina).\r\nLater on their true nature was discovered by F. Dujardin, working on\r\nliving forms, and he referred them to his Rhizopoda, characterized by\r\npseudopodia given off from the sarcode (protoplasm) as organs of\r\nprehension and locomotion. W.B. Carpenter in 1862 differentiated the\r\ngroup nearly in its present limits as \"Reticularia\"; and since then it\r\nhas been rendered more natural by the removal of a number of simple\r\nforms (mostly freshwater) with branching but not reticulate pseudopods,\r\nto Filosa, a distinct subclass, now united with Lobosa into the\r\nrestricted class of Rhizopoda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1A.--_Lieberkuhnia_, with reticulate pseudopodia.]\r\n\r\n_Anatomy._--Protista Sarcodina, with simple protoplasmic bodies of\r\n_granular surface_, emitting processes which branch and _anastomose\r\nfreely_, either from the whole surface or from one or more elongated\r\nprocesses (\"stylopods\"); nucleus one or more (not yet demonstrated in\r\nsome little known simple forms), usually in genetic relation to granules\r\nor strands of matter of similar composition, the \"chromidia\" scattered\r\nthrough the protoplasm; body naked, or provided with a permanent\r\ninvestment (shell or test), membranous, gelatinous, arenaceous (of\r\ncompacted or cemented granules), calcareous, or very rarely (in deep sea\r\nforms) siliceous, sometimes freely perforated, but _never latticed_;\r\nopening by one or more permanent apertures (\"pylomes\") or crevices\r\nbetween compacted sand-granules, often very complex; reproduction by\r\nfission (only in simplest naked forms), or by brood formation; in the\r\nlatter case one mode of brood formation (A) eventuates in amoebiform\r\nembryos, the other (B) in flagellate zoospores which are exogamous\r\ngametes, pairing but not with those of their own brood; the coupled cell\r\n(\"zygote\") when mature in the shelled species gives rise to a very small\r\nprimitive test-chamber or \"microsphere.\" The adult microspheric animal\r\ngives rise to the amoebiform brood which have a larger primitive test\r\n(\"megalosphere\"); and megalospheric forms appear to reproduce by the A\r\ntype a series of similar forms before a B brood of gametes is finally\r\nborne, to pair and reproduce the microspheric type, which is\r\nconsequently rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1B.--_Protomyxa aurantiaca_, Haeck.

Moor pools, Ireland.\r\n\r\n  12, _Diaphorophodon mobile_, Archer.\r\n    a. Nucleus. Moor pools, Ireland.]\r\n\r\nThe shells require special study. In the lowest forms they are\r\nmembranous, sometimes encrusted with sand-grains, always very simple,\r\nthe only complication being the doubling of the pylome in _Diplophrys_\r\n(fig. 2, 1), _Shepheardella_ (fig. 2, 3-5), _Amphitrema_ (fig. 2, 11),\r\n_Diaphorophodon_ (fig. 2, 12). The marine shells are, as we have seen,\r\nof cemented particles, or calcareous, glassy, and regularly perforated,\r\nor again calcareous, but porcellanous and rarely perforate. These\r\ncharacters have been used as a guide to classification; but some sandy\r\nforms have so large a proportion of calcareous cement that they might\r\nwell be called encrusted calcareous genera, and are also not very\r\nconstant in respect of the character of perforation. The porcellanous\r\ngenera, however, form a compact group, the replacement of the shell by\r\nsilica in forms dwelling in the red clay of the ocean abysses, where\r\ncalcium carbonate is soluble, not really making any difficulty.\r\nMoreover, the shells of this group show a deflected process or neck of\r\nthe embryonic chamber (\"camptopyle\") at least in the megalospheric\r\nforms, whereas when such a neck exists in other groups it is straight.\r\nThe opening of the shell is called the pylome. This may be a mere hole\r\nwhere the lateral walls of the body end, or there may be a diaphragmatic\r\ningrowth so as to narrow the entrance. It may be a simple rounded\r\nopening, oblong or tri-multi-radiate, or branching (fig. 4, 1); or\r\nreplaced by a number of coarse pores (\"ethmopyle\") (fig. 3, 5a). Again,\r\nit may lie at the end of a narrowed tube (\"stylopyle\"), which in\r\n_Lagena_ (fig. 3, 9) may project outwards (\"ectoselenial\"), or inwards\r\n(\"entoselenial\"). In most groups the stylopyle is straight; but in the\r\nmajority of the porcellanous shells it is bent down on the side of the\r\nshell, and constitutes the \"flexopyle\" of A. Kemna, which being a hybrid\r\nterm should be replaced by \"camptopyle.\" The animal usually forms a\r\nsimple shell only after it has attained a certain size, and this\r\n\"embryonic chamber\" cannot grow further. In _Spirillina_ and\r\n_Ammodiscus_ there is no pylomic end-wall, and the shell continues to\r\ngrow as a spiral tube; in _Cornuspira_ (fig. 3, 1) there is a slight\r\nconstriction indicating the junction of a small embryonic chamber with a\r\ncamptopyle, but the rest of the shell is a simple flat spiral of several\r\nturns. In the majority at least one chamber follows the first, with its\r\nown pylome at the distal end. This second chamber may rest on the first,\r\nso that the part on which it rests serves as a party-wall bounding the\r\nfront of the newer chamber as well as the back of the older; and this\r\nstate prevails for all added chambers in such cases. In the highest\r\nvitreous shells, however, each chamber has its complete \"proper wall\";\r\nwhile a \"supplementary skeleton,\" a deposit of shelly matter, binds the\r\nchambers together into a compact whole. In all cases the protoplasm from\r\nthe pylome may deposit additional matter on the outside of the shell, so\r\nas to produce very characteristic sculpturing of the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Various forms of Calcareous Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n   1, _Cornuspira_.              11, _Cristellaria_.\r\n   2, _Spiroloculina_.           12, _Globigerina_.\r\n   3, _Triloculina_.             13, _Polymorphina_.\r\n   4, _Biloculina_.              14, _Textularia_.\r\n   5, _Peneroplis_.              15, _Discorbina_.\r\n   6, _Orbiculina_ (cyclical).   16, _Polystomella_.\r\n   7, _Orbiculina_ (young).      17, _Planorbulina_.\r\n   8, _Orbiculina_ (spiral).     18, _Rotalia_.\r\n   9, _Lagena_.                  19, _Nonionina_.\r\n  10, _Nodosaria_.]\r\n\r\nCompound or \"polythalamic\" shells derive their general form largely from\r\nthe relations of successive chambers in size, shape and direction. This\r\nis well shown in the porcellanous _Miliolidae_. If we call the straight\r\nline uniting the two ends of a chamber the \"polar axis,\" we find that\r\nsuccessive chambers have their pylomes at alternate poles; but they lie\r\non different meridians. In _Spiroloculina_ (fig. 3, 2) the divergence\r\nbetween the meridians is 180 deg., and the chambers are strongly\r\nincurved, so that the whole shell forms a flat spiral, of nearly\r\ncircular outline. In the majority, however, the chambers are crescentic\r\nin section, their transverse prolongations being termed \"alary\"\r\noutgrowths, so that successive chambers overlap; when under this\r\ncondition the angle of successive meridians is still 180 deg. we have\r\nthe form _Biloculina_ (fig. 3, 4), or with the alary extensions\r\ncompletely enveloping, _Uniloculina_; when the angle is 120 deg. we have\r\n_Triloculina_, or 144 deg., _Quinqueloculina_. Again in _Peneroplis_\r\n(figs. 3, 5, and 4) the shell begins as a flattened shell which tends to\r\nstraighten out with further growth and additional chambers. In some\r\nforms (_Spirolina_, fig. 22, 3) the chambers have a nearly circular\r\ntransverse section, and the adult shell is thus crozier-shaped. In\r\nothers (which may have the same sculpture, and are scarcely\r\ndistinguishable as species) the chambers are short and wide, drawn out\r\nat right angles to the axis, but in the plane of the spiral, and the\r\ngrowing shell becomes fan-shaped or \"flabelliform\" (figs. 3, 5, 4, 2).\r\nThis widening may go on till the outer chambers form the greater part of\r\na circle, as in _Orbiculina_ (fig. 3, 6-8) where, moreover, each large\r\nchamber is subdivided by incomplete vertical bulkheads into a tier of\r\nchamberlets; each chamberlet has a distinct pylomic pore opening to the\r\noutside or to those of the next outer zone. In _Orbitolites_ (figs. 5,\r\n6) we have a centre on a somewhat Milioline type; and after a few\r\nchambers in spiral succession, complete circles of chambers are formed.\r\nIn the larger forms the new zones are of greater height, and horizontal\r\nbulkheads divide the\r\n\r\nchamberlets into vertical tiers, each with its own pylomic pore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Modifications of _Peneroplis_. 1, _Dendritina_;\r\n2, _Eu-Peneroplis_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Shell of simple type of _Orbitolites_, showing\r\nprimordial chamber a, and circumambient chamber b, surrounded by\r\nsuccessive rings of chamberlets connected by circular galleries which\r\nopen at the margin by pores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Animal of simple type of _Orbitolites_, showing\r\nprimordial segment a, and circumambient segment b, surrounded by annuli\r\nof sub-segments connected by radial and circular stolon-processes.]\r\n\r\nThe Cheilostomellidae (fig. 3, 13) reproduce among perforate vitreous\r\ngenera what we have already seen in the _Miliolida_: _Orbitoides_ (fig.\r\n10, 2) and _Cycloclypeus_, among the Nummulite group, with a very finely\r\nperforate wall, recall the porcellanous _Orbiculina_ and _Orbitolites_.\r\n\r\nIn flat spiral forms (figs. 22, 1, 7; 3, 2, 16, 19, &c.) all the\r\nchambers may be freely exposed; or the successive chambers be wider\r\ntransversely than their predecessors and overlap by \"alary extensions,\"\r\nbecoming \"nautiloid\"; in extreme cases only the last turn or whorl is\r\nseen (fig. 11). When the spiral axis is conical the shell may be\r\n\"rotaloid,\" the larger lower chambers partially concealing the upper\r\nsmaller ones (fig. 3, 12, 15, 17, 18); or they may leave, as in\r\n_Patellina_, a wide central conical cavity--which, in this genus, is\r\nfinally occupied by later formed \"supplementary\" chambers. When the\r\nsuccessive chambers are disposed around a longitudinal central axis they\r\nmay be said to \"alternate\" like the leaves of a plant. If the\r\narrangement is distichous we get such forms as _Polymorphina_,\r\n_Textularia_ and _Frondicularia_ (fig. 3, 13, 14), if tristichous,\r\n_Tritaxia_. Such an arrangement may coexist with a spiral twist of the\r\naxis for at least part of its course, as in the crozier-shaped\r\n_Spiroplecta_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Section of _Rotalia beccarii_, showing the canal\r\nsystem, a, b, c, in the substance of the intermediate skeleton; d,\r\ntubulated chamber-wall.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Internal cast of _Polystomella craticulata_.\r\n\r\n  a, Retral processes, proceeding from the posterior margin of one of\r\n    the segments.\r\n  b, b^1, Smooth anterior margin of the same segment.\r\n  c, c^1, Stolons connecting successive segments and uniting themselves\r\n    with the diverging branches of the meridional canals.\r\n  d, d^1, d^2, Three turns of one of the spiral canals.\r\n  e, e^1, e^2, Three of the meridional canals.\r\n  f, f^1, f^2, Their diverging branches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Operculina_ laid open, to show its internal\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n  a, Marginal cord seen in cross section at a'.\r\n  b, b, External walls of the chambers.\r\n  c, c, Cavities of the chambers.\r\n  c', c', Their alar prolongations.\r\n  d, d, Septa divided at d', d', and at d\", so as to lay open the\r\n    interseptal canals, the general distribution of which is seen in the\r\n    septa e, e; the lines radiating from e, e point to the secondary\r\n    pores.\r\n  g, g, Non-tubular columns.]\r\n\r\nTwo phenomena interfere with the ready availability of the characters of\r\nform for classificatory ends--dimorphism and multiformity.\r\n\r\n_Dimorphism._--The majority of foraminiferal shells show two types, the\r\nrarer with a much smaller central chamber than that of the more\r\nfrequent. The chambers are called microsphere and megalosphere, the\r\nforms in which they occur microsphaeric and megalosphaeric forms,\r\nrespectively. We shall study below their relation to the reproductive\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--1, Piece of Nummulitic Limestone from the\r\nPyrenees, showing Nummulites laid open by fracture through the median\r\nplane; 2, vertical section of _Nummulite_; 3, _Orbitoides_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Vertical section of portion of _Nummulites_,\r\nshowing the investment of the earlier whorls by the alar prolongations\r\nof the later.\r\n\r\n  a, Marginal cord.\r\n  b, Chamber of outer whorl.\r\n  c, c, Whorl invested by a.\r\n  d, One of the chambers of the fourth whorl from the margin.\r\n  e, e', Marginal portions of the enclosed whorls.\r\n  f, Investing portion of the outer whorl.\r\n  g, g, Spaces left between the investing portions of successive whorls.\r\n  h, h, Sections of the partitions dividing these.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Internal surface of wall of two chambers, a, a,\r\nof _Nummulites_, showing the orifices of its minute tubuli.\r\n\r\n  b, b, The septa containing canals.\r\n  c, c, Extensions of these canals in the intermediate skeleton.\r\n  d, d, Larger pores.]\r\n\r\n_Multiformity._--Many of the Polythalamia show different types of\r\nchamber-succession at different ages. We have noted this phenomenon in\r\nsuch crozier forms as _Peneroplis_, as well as in discoid forms; it is\r\nvery frequent. Thus the microspheric _Biloculina_ form the first few\r\nchambers in quinqueloculine succession. The microspheric forms attain to\r\na greater size when adult than the megalospheric; and in _Orbitolites_\r\nthe microsphere has a straight outlet, orthostyle, instead of the\r\ndeflected camptostyle one, so general in porcellanous types; and the\r\nspiral succession is continued for more turns before reaching the\r\nfan-shaped and finally cyclic stage. _Globigerina_, whose chambers are\r\nnearly spherical, is sometimes seen to be enclosed in a spherical test,\r\nperforate, but without a pylome, and known as _Orbulina_; the chambered\r\nGlobigerina-shell is attached at first inside the wall of the\r\n_Orbulina_, but ultimately disappears. The ultimate fate of the\r\n_Orbulina_ shell is unknown; but it obviously marks a turning-point in\r\nthe life-cycle.\r\n\r\n  _Protoplasmic Body and Reproduction._--The protoplasm is not\r\n  differentiated into ecto- and endosarc, although it is often denser\r\n  in the central part within the shell, and clearer in the pseudopodial\r\n  ramifications and the layer (or stalk in the monothalamic forms) from\r\n  which it is given off. In pelagic forms like _Globigerina_ the\r\n  external layer is almost if not quite identical in structure with the\r\n  extracapsular protoplasm of Radiolaria (q.v.), being differentiated\r\n  into granular strands traversing a clear jelly, rich in large vacuoles\r\n  (alveoli), and uniting outside the jelly to form the basal layer of\r\n  the pseudopods; these again are radiolarian in character. Hence E.R.\r\n  Lankester justly enough compares the shell here to the central capsule\r\n  of the Radiolarian, though the comparison must not be pushed too far.\r\n  The cytoplasm contains granules of various kinds, and the internal\r\n  protoplasm is sometimes pigmented. The Chrysomonad Flagellate,\r\n  _Zooxanthella_, so abundant in its resting state--the so-called\r\n  \"yellow cells\"--in the extracapsular protoplasm of Radiolaria (q.v.)\r\n  also occurs in the outer protoplasm of many Foraminifera, not only\r\n  pelagic but also bottom-dwellers, such as _Orbitolites_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Internal cast of two chambers, a, a, of\r\n  _Nummulites_, the radial canals between them passing into b, marginal\r\n  plexus.]\r\n\r\n  The nucleus is single in the Nuda and Allogromidia and in the\r\n  megalospheric forms of higher Foraminifera; but microspheric forms\r\n  when adult contain many simple similar nuclei. The nucleus in every\r\n  case gives off granules and irregular masses (\"chromidia\") of similar\r\n  reactions, which play an important part in reproduction. During the\r\n  maturation of the microsphere the nuclei disappear; and the cytoplasm\r\n  breaks up into a large number of zoospores, each of which is soon\r\n  provided with a single nucleus, whether entirely derived from the\r\n  parent-nucleus or from the coalescence of chromidia, or from both\r\n  these sources is still uncertain. These zoospores are amoeboid; they\r\n  soon secrete a shell and reveal themselves as megalospheres, the\r\n  original state of the megalospheric forms. In the adult megalosphere\r\n  the solitary nucleus disappears and is replaced by hosts of minute\r\n  vesicular nuclei, formed by the concentration of chromidia. Each\r\n  nucleus aggregates around it a proper zone of dense protoplasm; by two\r\n  successive mitotic divisions each mass becomes quadri-nucleate, and\r\n  splits up into four biflagellate, uninucleate zoospores. These are\r\n  pairing-cells or gametes, though they will not pair with members of\r\n  the same brood. In the zygote resulting from pairing two nuclei soon\r\n  fuse into one; but this again divides into two; an embryonic shell is\r\n  secreted, and this is the microspheric type, which is multinuclear\r\n  from the first. F. Schaudinn compares the nuclei of the adult\r\n  Foraminifera with the (vegetative) meganucleus of Infusora (q.v.) and\r\n  the chromidial mass with the micronucleus, whose chief function is\r\n  reproductive.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Vertical section of tubulated chamber-walls,\r\n  a, a, of _Nummulites_. b, b, Marginal cord; c, cavity of chamber; d,\r\n  d, non-tubulated columns.]\r\n\r\n  Since megalospheric forms are by far the most abundant, it seems\r\n  probable that under most conditions they also give rise to\r\n  megalospheric young like themselves; and that the production of\r\n  zoospores, pairing to pass into the microspheric form, is only\r\n  occasional, and possibly seasonal. This life-history we owe to the\r\n  researches of Schaudinn and J.J. Lister.\r\n\r\n  In several species (notably _Patellina_) plastogamy, the union of the\r\n  cytoplasmic bodies without nuclear fusion, has been noted, as a\r\n  prelude to the resolution of the conjoined protoplasm into uninucleate\r\n  amoebulae.\r\n\r\n  _Calcituba_, a porcellanous type, which after forming the embryonic\r\n  chamber with its deflected pylome grows into branching stems, may fall\r\n  apart into sections, or the protoplasm may escape and break up into\r\n  small amoebulae. Of the reproduction of the simplest forms we know\r\n  little. In _Mikrogromia_ the cell undergoes fission within the test,\r\n  and on its completion the daughter-cells may emerge as biflagellate\r\n  zoospores.\r\n\r\n  The sandy shells are a very interesting series. In _Astrorhiza_ the\r\n  sand grains are loosely agglutinated, without mineral cement; they\r\n  leave numerous pores for the exit of the protoplasm, and there are no\r\n  true pylomes. In other forms the union of the grains by a calcareous\r\n  or ferruginous cement necessitates the existence of distinct pylomes.\r\n  Many of the species reproduce the varieties of form found in\r\n  calcareous tests; some are finely perforated, others not. Many of the\r\n  larger ones have their walls thickened internally and traversed by\r\n  complex passages; this structure is called _labyrinthic_ (fig. 19, g,\r\n  h). The shell of _Endothyra_, a form only known to us by its abundance\r\n  in Carboniferous and Triassic strata, is largely composed of calcite\r\n  and is sometimes perforated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Cycloclypeus_.]\r\n\r\n  It is noteworthy that though of similar habitat each species selects\r\n  its own size or sort of sand, some utilizing the siliceous spicules of\r\n  sponges. Despite the roughness of the materials, they are often so\r\n  laid as to yield a perfectly smooth inner wall; and sometimes the\r\n  outer wall may be as simple. As we can find no record of a deflected\r\n  stylopyle to the primitive chamber of the polythalamous Arenacea, it\r\n  is safe to conclude that they have no close alliance with the\r\n  Porcellanea.\r\n\r\n  _Classification._\r\n\r\n  I. NUDA.--Protoplasmic body without any pellicle or shell save in the\r\n  resting encysted condition, sometimes forming colonial aggregates by\r\n  coalescence of pseudopods (_Myxodictyum_), or even plasmodia\r\n  (_Protomyxa_). Brood cells at first uniflagellate or amoeboid from\r\n  birth. Fresh-water and marine genera _Protogenes_ (Haeckel), _Biomyxa_\r\n  (Leidy), _Myxodictyum_ (Haeckel), _Protomyxa_ (Haeckel) (fig. 1B).\r\n\r\n  This group of very simple forms includes many of Haeckel's Monera,\r\n  defined as \"cytodes,\" masses of protoplasm without a nucleus. A\r\n  nucleus (or nuclei) has, however, been demonstrated by improved\r\n  methods of staining in so many that it is probable that this\r\n  distinction will fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--_Heterostegina_.]\r\n\r\n  II. ALLOGROMIDIACEAE (figs. 1A, 2).--Protoplasmic body protected in\r\n  adult state by an imperforate test with one or two openings (pylomes)\r\n  for the exit of the stylopod; test simple, gelatinous, membranous,\r\n  sometimes incrusted with foreign bodies, never calcareous nor\r\n  arenaceous; reproduction by fission alone known. Fresh-water or marine\r\n  genera _Allogromia_ (Rhumbl.), _Myxotheca_ (Schaud.), _Lieberkuhnia_\r\n  (Cl. & L.)

This group\r\n  differs from the preceding in its simple test, but, like it, includes\r\n  many fresh-water species, which possess contractile vacuoles.\r\n\r\n  III. ASTRORHIZIDIACEAE.--Simple forms, rarely polythalamous (some\r\n  _Rhabdamminidae_), but often branching or radiate; test arenaceous,\r\n  loosely compacted and traversed by chinks for pseudopodia\r\n  (_Astrorhizidae_), or dense, and opening by one or more terminal\r\n  pylomes at ends of branches. Marine, 4 Fam. The test of some\r\n  _Astrorhizidae_ is so loose that it falls to pieces when taken out of\r\n  water. _Haliphysema_ is remarkable for its history in relation to the\r\n  \"gastraea theory.\" _Pilulina_ has a neat globular shell of\r\n  sponge-spicules and fine sand.

(fig. 15); _Nummulites_ (Lamk.) (figs. 10,\r\n  11, 12, 13, 14).\r\n\r\n  \"_Eozoon canadense_,\" described as a species of this order by J.W.\r\n  Dawson and Carpenter, has been pronounced by a series of enquirers,\r\n  most of whom started with a belief in its organic structure, to be\r\n  merely a complex mineral concretion in ophicalcite, a rock composed of\r\n  an admixture of silicates (mostly serpentine and pyroxene) and\r\n  calcite.\r\n\r\n_Distribution in Vertical Space._--Owing to their lack of organs for\r\nactive locomotion the Foraminifera are all crawling or attached, with\r\nthe exception of a few genera (very rich in species, however) which\r\nfloat near the surface of the ocean, constituting part of the pelagic\r\nplankton (q.v.). Thus the majority are littoral or deep-sea, sometimes\r\nattached to other bodies or even burrowing in the tests of other\r\nForaminifera; most of the fresh-water forms are sapropelic, inhabiting\r\nthe layer of organic debris at the surface of the bottom mud ditches of\r\npools, ponds and lakes. The deep-sea species below a certain depth\r\ncannot possess a calcareous shell, for this would be dissolved; and it\r\nis in these that we find limesalts sometimes replaced by silica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Arenaceous Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n  a, Exterior of _Saccammina_.\r\n  b, The same laid open.\r\n  c, Portion of test more highly magnified.\r\n  d, _Pilulina_.\r\n  e, Portion of test more highly magnified.\r\n  f, Nautiloid _Lituola_, exterior.\r\n  g, Chambered interior.\r\n  h, Portion of labyrinthic chamber wall, showing component sand-grains.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Section of _Fusulina_ Limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Microscopic Organisms in Chalk from Gravesend.\r\na, b, c, d, _Textularia globulosa_; e, e, e, e, _Rotalia aspera_; f,\r\n_Textularia aculeata_; g, _Planularia hexas_; h, _Navicula_.]\r\n\r\nThe pelagic floating genera are also specially modified. Their shell is\r\neither thin or extended many times by long slender tapering spines, and\r\nthe protoplasm outside has the same character as that of the Radiolaria\r\n(q.v.), being differentiated into jelly containing enormous vacuoles and\r\ntraversed by reticulate strands of granular protoplasm. These coalesce\r\ninto a peripheral zone from which protrude the pseudopods, here rather\r\nradiate than reticulate. Most genera and most species are cosmopolitan;\r\nbut local differences are often marked. Foraminifera abound in the shore\r\nsands and the crevices of coral reefs. The membranous shelled forms\r\ndecay without leaving traces. The sandy or calcareous shells of dead\r\nForaminifera constitute a large proportion of littoral sand, both below\r\nand above tide marks; and, as shown in the boring on Funafuti, enter\r\nlargely into the constituents of coral rock. They may accumulate in the\r\nmud of the bottom to constitute Foraminiferal ooze. The source of these\r\nshells in the latter case is double: (1) shells of bottom-dwellers\r\naccumulate on the spot; (2) shells of dead plankton forms sink down in a\r\ncontinuous shower, to form a layer at the bottom of the ocean, during\r\nwhich process the spines are dissolved by the sea-water. Thus is formed\r\nan ooze known as \"Globigerina-ooze,\" being formed largely of that genus\r\nand its ally _Hastigerina_; below 3000 fathoms even the tests themselves\r\nare dissolved. Casts of their bodies in glauconite (a green ferrous\r\nsilicate, whose composition has not yet been accurately determined) are,\r\nhowever, frequently left. Glauconitic casts of perforate shells, notably\r\n_Globigerina_, have been found in Lower Cambrian (e.g. Hollybush\r\nSandstone), and the shells themselves in Siberian limestones of that\r\nage. It is only when we pass into the Silurian Wenlock limestone that\r\nsandy shells make their appearance. Above this horizon Foraminifera are\r\nmore abundant as constituents, partial or principal of calcareous rocks,\r\nthe genus _Endothyra_ being indeed almost confined to Carboniferous\r\nbeds. The genus _Fusulina_ (fig. 20) and _Saccammina_ (fig. 19) give\r\ntheir names (from their respective abundance) to two limestones of the\r\nCarboniferous series. Porcellanous shells become abundant only from the\r\nLias upwards. The glauconitic grains of the Greensand formations are\r\nchiefly foraminiferal casts. Chalk is well known to consist largely of\r\nforaminiferal shells, mostly vitreous, like the north Atlantic\r\nglobigerina ooze. In the Maestricht chalk more littoral conditions\r\nprevailed, and we find such large-sized species as _Orbitoides_\r\n(vitreous) and _Orbitolites_ (porcellanous; figs. 5, 6), &c. In the\r\nEocene Tertiaries the Calcaire Grossier of the Paris basin is mainly\r\ncomposed of Miliolid forms. Nummulites occur in English beds and in the\r\nParis basin; but the great beds of these, forming reef-like masses of\r\nlimestone, occur farther south, extending from the Pyrenees through the\r\nsouthern and eastern Alps to Egypt, Sinai, and on to north India. The\r\npeculiar structure occurring in the Lower Laurentian limestone, as well\r\nas other limestones of Archean age described as a Nummulitaceous genus,\r\n\"_Eozoon_,\" by Carpenter and Dawson, and abundantly illustrated in the\r\n9th edition of his encyclopaedia, is now universally regarded as of\r\ninorganic origin. \"Looking at the almost universal diffusion of\r\nexisting Foraminifera and the continuous accumulation of their shells\r\nover vast areas of the ocean-bottom, they are certainly doing more than\r\nany other group of organisms to separate carbonate of lime from its\r\nsolution in sea-water, so as to restore to the solid crust of the earth\r\nwhat is being continuously withdrawn from it by solution of the\r\ncalcareous materials of the land above sea-level.\" (E.R.

C.E. Ehrenberg added a large number of species, but it was to\r\nF. Dujardin in 1835 that we owe the recognition of their true zoological\r\nposition and the characters of the living animal. W.B. Carpenter and\r\nW.C. Williamson in England contributed largely to the study of the\r\nshell, the latter being the first to call attention to its multiform\r\ncharacter in the development of a single species, and to utilize the\r\nmethod of thin sections, which has proved so fertile in results. W.K.\r\nParker and H.B. Brady, separately, and in collaboration, described an\r\nenormous number of forms in a series of papers, as well as in the\r\nmonograph by the latter of the Foraminifera of the \"Challenger\"\r\nexpedition. Munier-Chalmas and Schlumberger brought out the fact of\r\ndimorphism in the group, which was later elucidated and incorporated in\r\nthe full cytological study of the life-cycle of Foraminifera by J.J.\r\nLister and F. Schaudinn, independently, but with concurrent results.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--The chief recent books are: F. Chapman, _The\r\n  Foraminifera_ (1902), and J.J.

The multinucleate protoplasm is contained in\r\n  branching tubes, aggregated into masses of definite form, bounded by a\r\n  common wall of foreign bodies (sponge spicules, &c.) cemented into a\r\n  membrane. The cytoplasm contains granules of BaSO4 and pellets of\r\n  faecal matter. All that is known of reproduction is the resolution of\r\n  the pellets into uninucleate cells. (F.E.

He was the second son of John Henry\r\nForbes, Lord Medwyn, a judge of the court of session, and grandson of\r\nSir William Forbes of Pitsligo. He studied first at the Edinburgh\r\nAcademy, then for two years under the Rev. Thomas Dale, the poet, in\r\nKent, passed one session at Glasgow University in 1833, and, having\r\nchosen the career of the Indian civil service, completed his studies\r\nwith distinction at Haileybury College. In 1836 he went to Madras and\r\nsecured early promotion, but in consequence of ill-health he was obliged\r\nto return to England. He then entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where\r\nin 1841 he obtained the Boden Sanskrit scholarship, and graduated in\r\n1844. He was at Oxford during the early years of the movement known as\r\nPuseyism, and was powerfully influenced by association with Newman,\r\nPusey and Keble. This led him to resign his Indian appointment. In 1844\r\nhe was ordained deacon and priest in the English Church, and held\r\ncuracies at Aston, Rowant and St Thomas's, Oxford; but being naturally\r\nattracted to the Episcopal Church of his native land, then recovering\r\nfrom long depression, he removed in 1846 to Stonehaven, the chief town\r\nof Kincardineshire. The same year, however, he was appointed to the\r\nvicarage of St Saviour's, Leeds, a church founded to preach and\r\nillustrate Tractarian principles. In 1848 Forbes was called to succeed\r\nBishop Moir in the see of Brechin. He removed the episcopal residence to\r\nDundee, where he resided till his death, combining the pastoral charge\r\nof the congregation with the duties of the see. When he came to Dundee\r\nthe churchmen were accustomed owing to their small numbers to worship in\r\na room over a bank. Through his energy several churches were built, and\r\namong them the pro-cathedral of St Paul's. He was prosecuted in the\r\nchurch courts for heresy, the accusation being founded on his primary\r\ncharge, delivered and published in 1857, in which he set forth his views\r\non the Eucharist. He made a powerful defence of the charge, and was\r\nacquitted with \"a censure and an admonition.\" Keble wrote in his\r\ndefence, and was present at his trial at Edinburgh. Forbes was a good\r\nscholar, a scientific theologian and a devoted worker, and was much\r\nbeloved. He died at Dundee on the 8th of October 1875.\r\n\r\n  Principal works: _A Short Explanation of the Nicene Creed_ (1852); _An\r\n  Explanation of the Thirty-nine Articles_ (2 vols., 1867 and 1868);\r\n  _Commentary on the Seven Penitential Psalms_ (1847); _Commentary on\r\n  the Canticles_ (1853). See Mackey's _Bishop Forbes, a Memoir_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, ARCHIBALD (1838-1900), British war correspondent, the son of a\r\nPresbyterian minister in Morayshire, was born on the 17th of April 1838,\r\nand was educated at Aberdeen University. Entering the Royal Dragoons as\r\na private, he gained, while in the service, considerable practical\r\nexperience of military life and affairs. Being invalided from his\r\nregiment, he settled in London, and became a journalist. When the\r\nFranco-German War broke out in 1870, Forbes was sent to the front as war\r\ncorrespondent to the _Morning Advertiser_, and in this capacity he\r\ngained valuable information as to the plans of the Parisians for\r\nwithstanding a siege. Transferring his services to the _Daily News_, his\r\nbrilliant feats in the transmission of intelligence drew world-wide\r\nattention to his despatches. He was with the German army from the\r\nbeginning of the campaign, and he afterwards witnessed the rise and fall\r\nof the Commune. Forbes afterwards proceeded to Spain, where he\r\nchronicled the outbreak of the second Carlist War; but his work here was\r\ninterrupted by a visit to India, where he spent eight months upon a\r\nmission of investigation into the Bengal famine of 1874. Then he\r\nreturned to Spain, and followed at various times the Carlist, the\r\nRepublican and the Alfonsist forces. As representative of the _Daily\r\nNews_, he accompanied the prince of Wales in his tour through India in\r\n1875-1876. Forbes went through the Servian campaign of 1876, and was\r\npresent at all the important engagements. In the Russo-Turkish campaign\r\nof 1877 he achieved striking journalistic successes at great personal\r\nrisk. Attached to the Russian army, he witnessed most of the principal\r\noperations, and remained continuously in the field until attacked by\r\nfever. His letters, together with those of his colleagues, MacGahan and\r\nMillet, were republished by the _Daily News_. On recovering from his\r\nfever, Forbes proceeded to Cyprus, in order to witness the British\r\noccupation. The same year (1878) he went to India, and in the winter\r\naccompanied the Khyber Pass force to Jalalabad. He was present at the\r\ntaking of Ali Musjid, and marched with several expeditions against the\r\nhill tribes. Burma was Forbes's next field of adventure, and at\r\nMandalay, the capital, he had several interesting interviews with King\r\nThibaw. He left Burma hurriedly for South Africa, where, in consequence\r\nof the disaster of Isandlwana, a British force was collecting for the\r\ninvasion of Zululand. He was present at the victory of Ulundi, and his\r\nfamous ride of 120 m. in fifteen hours, by which he was enabled to\r\nconvey the first news of the battle to England, remains one of the\r\nfinest achievements in journalistic enterprise. Forbes subsequently\r\ndelivered many lectures on his war experiences to large audiences. His\r\nclosing years were spent in literary work. He had some years before\r\npublished a military novel entitled _Drawn from Life_, and a volume on\r\nhis experiences of the war between France and Germany. These were now\r\nfollowed by numerous publications, including _Glimpses through the\r\nCannon Smoke_ (1880); _Souvenirs of some Continents_ (1885); _William I.\r\nof Germany: a Biography_ (1888); _Havelock_, in the \"English Men of\r\nAction\" Series (1890); _Barracks, Bivouacs, and Battles_ (1891); _The\r\nAfghan Wars_, 1839-80 (1892); _Czar and Sultan_ (1895); _Memories and\r\nStudies of War and Peace_ (1895), in many respects autobiographic; and\r\n_Colin Campbell, Lord Clyde_ (1896). He died on the 30th of March 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, DAVID (1828-1876), British mineralogist, metallurgist and\r\nchemist, brother of Edward Forbes (q.v.), was born on the 6th of\r\nSeptember 1828, at Douglas, Isle of Man, and received his early\r\neducation there and at Brentwood in Essex. When a boy of fourteen he had\r\nalready acquired a remarkable knowledge of chemistry. This subject he\r\nstudied at the university of Edinburgh, and he was still young when he\r\nwas appointed superintendent of the mining and metallurgical works at\r\nEspedal in Norway. Subsequently he became a partner in the firm of Evans\r\n& Askin, nickel-smelters, of Birmingham, and in that capacity during the\r\nyears 1857-1860 he visited Chile, Bolivia and Peru. Besides reports for\r\nthe Iron and Steel Institute, of which, during the last years of his\r\nlife, he was foreign secretary, he wrote upwards of 50 papers on\r\nscientific subjects, among which are the following: \"The Action of\r\nSulphurets on Metallic Silicates at High Temperatures,\" _Rep. Brit.\r\nAssoc._, 1855, pt. ii. p. 62; \"The Relations of the Silurian and\r\nMetamorphic Rocks of the south of Norway,\" ib. p. 82; \"The Causes\r\nproducing Foliation in Rocks,\" _Journ. Geol. Soc._ xi., 1855; \"The\r\nChemical Composition of the Silurian and Cambrian Limestones,\" _Phil.\r\nMag._ xiii. pp. 365-373, 1857; \"The Geology of Bolivia and Southern\r\nPeru,\" _Journ. Geol. Soc._ xvii. pp. 7-62, 1861; \"The Mineralogy of\r\nChile,\" _Phil. Mag._, 1865; \"Researches in British Mineralogy,\" _Phil.\r\nMag._, 1867-1868. His observations on the geology of South America were\r\ngiven in a masterly essay, and these and subsequent researches threw\r\nmuch light on igneous and metamorphic phenomena and on the resulting\r\nchanges in rock-formations. He also contributed important articles on\r\nchemical geology to the _Chemical News_ and _Geological Magazine_ (1867\r\nand 1868). In England he was a pioneer in microscopic petrology. He was\r\nelected F.R.S. in 1858. He died in London on the 5th of December 1876.\r\n\r\n  See Obituary by P.M. Duncan in _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol.\r\n  xxxiii., 1877, p. 41; and by J. Morris in _Geol. Mag._, 1877, p. 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, DUNCAN, OF CULLODEN (1685-1747), Scottish statesman, was born at\r\nBunchrew or at Culloden near Inverness on the 10th of November 1685.\r\nAfter he had completed his studies at the universities of Edinburgh and\r\nLeiden, he was admitted advocate at the Scottish bar in 1709. His own\r\ntalents and the influence of the Argyll family secured his rapid\r\nadvancement, which was still further helped by his loyalty to the\r\nHanoverian cause at the period of the rebellion in 1715. In 1722 Forbes\r\nwas returned member for Inverness, and in 1725 he succeeded Dundas of\r\nArniston as lord advocate. He inherited the patrimonial estates on the\r\ndeath of his brother in 1734, and in 1737 he attained to the highest\r\nlegal honours in Scotland, being made lord president of the court of\r\nsession. As lord advocate, he had laboured to improve the legislation\r\nand revenue of the country, to extend trade and encourage manufactures,\r\nand no less to render the government popular and respected in Scotland.\r\nIn the proceedings which followed the memorable Porteous mob, for\r\nexample, when the government brought in a bill for disgracing the lord\r\nprovost of Edinburgh, for fining the corporation, and for abolishing\r\nthe town-guard and city-gate, Forbes both spoke and voted against the\r\nmeasure as an unwarranted outrage on the national feeling. As lord\r\npresident also he carried out some useful legal reforms; and his term of\r\noffice was characterized by quick and impartial administration of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion of 1745 found him at his post, and it tried all his\r\npatriotism. Some years before (1738) he had repeatedly and earnestly\r\nurged upon the government the expediency of embodying Highland\r\nregiments, putting them under the command of colonels whose loyalty\r\ncould be relied upon, but officering them with the native chieftains and\r\ncadets of old families in the north. \"If government,\" said he,\r\n\"pre-engages the Highlanders in the manner I propose, they will not only\r\nserve well against the enemy abroad, but will be hostages for the good\r\nbehaviour of their relations at home; and I am persuaded that it will be\r\nabsolutely impossible to raise a rebellion in the Highlands.\" In 1739,\r\nwith Sir Robert Walpole's approval, the original (1730) six companies\r\n(locally enlisted) of the Black Watch were formed into the famous\r\n\"Forty-second\" regiment of the line. The credit given to the earl of\r\nChatham in some histories for this movement is an error; it rests really\r\nwith Forbes and his friend Lord Islay, afterwards 3rd duke of Argyll\r\n(see the _Autobiography_ of the 8th duke of Argyll, vol. i. p. 8 sq.,\r\n1906).\r\n\r\nOn the first rumour of the Jacobite rising Forbes hastened to Inverness,\r\nand through his personal influence with the chiefs of Macdonald and\r\nMacleod, those two powerful western clans were prevented from taking the\r\nfield for Charles Edward; the town itself also he kept loyal and well\r\nprotected at the commencement of the struggle, and many of the\r\nneighbouring proprietors were won over by his persuasions. His\r\ncorrespondence with Lord Lovat, published in the Culloden papers,\r\naffords a fine illustration of his character, in which the firmness of\r\nloyal principle and duty is found blended with neighbourly kindness and\r\nconsideration. But at this critical juncture of affairs, the apathy of\r\nthe government interfered considerably with the success of his\r\nnegotiations. Advances of arms and money arrived too late, and though\r\nForbes employed all his own means and what money he could borrow on his\r\npersonal security, his resources were quite inadequate to the emergency.\r\nIt is doubtful whether these advances were ever fully repaid. Part was\r\ndoled out to him, after repeated solicitations that his credit might be\r\nmaintained in the country; but it is evident he had fallen into disgrace\r\nin consequence of his humane exertions to mitigate the impolitic\r\nseverities inflicted upon his countrymen after their disastrous defeat\r\nat Culloden. The ingratitude of the government, and the many distressing\r\ncircumstances connected with the insurrection, sunk deep into the mind\r\nof Forbes. He never fairly rallied from the depression thus caused, and\r\nafter a period of declining health he died on the 10th of December 1747.\r\n\r\nForbes was a patriot without ostentation or pretence, a true Scotsman\r\nwith no narrow prejudice, an accomplished and even erudite scholar\r\nwithout pedantry, a man of genuine piety without asceticism or\r\nintolerance. His country long felt his influence through her reviving\r\narts and institutions; and the example of such a character in that\r\ncoarse and venal age, and among a people distracted by faction,\r\npolitical strife, and national antipathies, while it was invaluable to\r\nhis contemporaries in a man of high position, is entitled to the lasting\r\ngratitude and veneration of his countrymen. In his intervals of leisure\r\nhe cultivated with some success the study of philosophy, theology and\r\nbiblical criticism. He is said to have been a diligent reader of the\r\nHebrew Bible. His published writings, some of them of importance,\r\ninclude--_A Letter to a Bishop, concerning some Important Discoveries in\r\nPhilosophy and Theology_ (1732); _Some Thoughts concerning Religion,\r\nnatural and revealed, and the Manner of Understanding Revelation_\r\n(1735); and _Reflections on Incredulity_ (2nd ed., 1750).\r\n\r\n  His correspondence was collected and published in 1815, and a memoir\r\n  of him (from the family papers) was written by Mr Hill Burton, and\r\n  published along with a _Life of Lord Lovat_, in 1847. His statue by\r\n  Roubillac stands in the Parliament House, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, EDWARD (1815-1854), British naturalist, was born at Douglas, in\r\nthe Isle of Man, on the 12th of February 1815. While still a child, when\r\nnot engaged in reading, or in the writing of verses and drawing of\r\ncaricatures, he occupied himself with the collecting of insects, shells,\r\nminerals, fossils, plants and other natural history objects. From his\r\nfifth to his eleventh year, delicacy of health precluded his attendance\r\nat any school, but in 1828 he became a day scholar at Athole House\r\nAcademy in Douglas. In June 1831 he left the Isle of Man for London,\r\nwhere he studied drawing. In October, however, having given up all idea\r\nof making painting his profession, he returned home; and in the\r\nfollowing month he matriculated as a student of medicine in the\r\nuniversity of Edinburgh. His vacation in 1832 he spent in diligent work\r\non the natural history of the Isle of Man. In 1833 he made a tour in\r\nNorway, the botanical results of which were published in Loudon's\r\n_Magazine of Natural History_ for 1835-1836. In the summer of 1834 he\r\ndevoted much time to dredging in the Irish Sea; and in the succeeding\r\nyear he travelled in France, Switzerland and Germany.\r\n\r\nBorn a naturalist, and having no relish for the practical duties of a\r\nsurgeon, Forbes in the spring of 1836 abandoned the idea of taking a\r\nmedical degree, resolving to devote himself to science and literature.\r\nThe winter of 1836-1837 found him at Paris, where he attended the\r\nlectures at the Jardin des Plantes on natural history, comparative\r\nanatomy, geology and mineralogy. Leaving Paris in April 1837, he went to\r\nAlgiers, and there obtained materials for a paper on land and freshwater\r\nMollusca, published in the _Annals of Natural History_, vol. ii. p. 250.\r\nIn the autumn of the same year he registered at Edinburgh as a student\r\nof literature; and in 1838 appeared his first volume, _Malacologia\r\nMonensis_, a synopsis of the species of Manx Mollusca. During the summer\r\nof 1838 he visited Styria and Carniola, and made extensive botanical\r\ncollections. In the following autumn he read before the British\r\nAssociation at Newcastle a paper on the distribution of terrestrial\r\nPulmonifera in Europe, and was commissioned to prepare a similar report\r\nwith reference to the British Isles. In 1841 was published his _History\r\nof British Star-fishes_, embodying extensive observations and containing\r\n120 illustrations, inclusive of humorous tail-pieces, all designed by\r\nthe author. On the 17th of April of the same year Forbes, accompanied by\r\nhis friend William Thompson, joined at Malta H.M. surveying ship\r\n\"Beacon,\" to which he had been appointed naturalist by her commander\r\nCaptain Graves. From that date until October 1842 he was employed in\r\ninvestigating the botany, zoology and geology of the Mediterranean\r\nregion. The results of these researches were made known in his \"Report\r\non the Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea, presented to the British\r\nAssociation in 1843,\" and in _Travels in Lycia_, published in\r\nconjunction with Lieut. (afterwards Admiral) T.A.B. Spratt in 1847. In\r\nthe former treatise he discussed the influence of climate and of the\r\nnature and depth of the sea bottom upon marine life, and divided the\r\nAegean into eight biological zones; his conclusions with respect to\r\nbathymetrical distribution, however, have naturally been modified to a\r\nconsiderable extent by the more recent explorations of the deep seas.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1842 Forbes, whom family misfortunes had now\r\nthrown upon his own resources, sought and obtained the curatorship of\r\nthe museum of the Geological Society of London. To the duties of that\r\npost he added in 1843 those of the professorship of botany at King's\r\nCollege. In November 1844 he resigned the curatorship of the Geological\r\nSociety, and became palaeontologist to the Geological Survey of Great\r\nBritain. Two years later he published in the _Memoirs of the Geological\r\nSurvey_, i. 336, his important essay \"On the Connexion between the\r\ndistribution of the existing Fauna and Flora of the British Isles, and\r\nthe Geological Changes which have affected their Area, especially during\r\nthe epoch of the Northern Drift.\" It is therein pointed out that, in\r\naccordance with the theory of their origin from various specific\r\ncentres, the plants of Great Britain may be divided into five\r\nwell-marked groups: the W. and S.W. Irish, represented in the N. of\r\nSpain, the S.E. Irish and S.W. English, related to the flora of the\r\nChannel Isles and the neighbouring part of France; the S.E. English,\r\ncharacterized by species occurring on the opposite French coast; a group\r\npeculiar to mountain summits, Scandinavian in type; and, lastly, a\r\ngeneral or Germanic flora. From a variety of arguments the conclusion is\r\ndrawn that the greater part of the terrestrial animals and flowering\r\nplants of the British Islands migrated thitherward, over continuous\r\nland, at three distinct periods, before, during and after the glacial\r\nepoch. On this subject Forbes's brilliant generalizations are now\r\nregarded as only partially true (see C. Reid's _Origin of the British\r\nFlora_, 1899). In the autumn of 1848 Forbes married the daughter of\r\nGeneral Sir C. Ashworth; and in the same year was published his\r\n_Monograph of the British Naked-eyed Medusae_ (Ray Society). The year\r\n1851 witnessed the removal of the collections of the Geological Survey\r\nfrom Craig's Court to the museum in Jermyn Street, and the appointment\r\nof Forbes as professor of natural history to the Royal School of Mines\r\njust established in conjunction therewith. In 1852 was published the\r\nfourth and concluding volume of Forbes and S. Hanley's _History of\r\nBritish Mollusca_; also his _Monograph of the Echinodermata of the\r\nBritish Tertiaries_ (Palaeontographical Soc.).\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Forbes held the presidency of the Geological Society of London,\r\nand in the following year he obtained the fulfilment of a long-cherished\r\nwish in his appointment to the professorship of natural history in the\r\nuniversity of Edinburgh, vacant by the death of R. Jameson, his former\r\nteacher. Since his return from the East in 1842, the determination and\r\narrangement of fossils, frequent lectures, and incessant literary work,\r\nincluding the preparation of his palaeontological memoirs, had precluded\r\nForbes from giving that attention to the natural history pursuits of his\r\nearlier life which he had earnestly desired. It seemed that at length he\r\nwas to find leisure to reduce to order his stores of biological\r\ninformation. He lectured at Edinburgh, in the summer session of 1854,\r\nand in September of that year he occupied the post of president of the\r\ngeological section at the Liverpool meeting of the British Association.\r\nBut he was taken ill just after he had commenced his winter's course of\r\nlectures in Edinburgh, and after not many days' illness he died at\r\nWardie, near Edinburgh, on the 18th of November 1854.\r\n\r\n  See _Literary Gazette_ (November 25, 1854); _Edinburgh New\r\n  Philosophical Journal_ (New Ser.), (1855); _Quart.

See also\r\n  _Literary Papers_, edited by Lovell Reeve (1855). The following works\r\n  were issued posthumously: \"On the Tertiary Fluviomarine Formation of\r\n  the Isle of Wight\" (_Geol.

Godwin-Austen (1859).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, JAMES DAVID (1809-1868), Scottish physicist, was the fourth son\r\nof Sir William Forbes, 7th baronet of Pitsligo, and was born at\r\nEdinburgh on the 20th of April 1809. He entered the university of\r\nEdinburgh in 1825, and soon afterwards began to contribute papers to the\r\n_Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_ anonymously under the signature\r\n\"[Delta].\" At the age of nineteen he became a fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh, and in 1832 he was elected to the Royal Society of\r\nLondon. A year later he was appointed professor of natural philosophy in\r\nEdinburgh University, in succession to Sir John Leslie and in\r\ncompetition with Sir David Brewster, and during his tenure of that\r\noffice, which he did not give up till 1860, he not only proved himself\r\nan active and efficient teacher, but also did much to improve the\r\ninternal conditions of the university. In 1859 he was appointed\r\nsuccessor to Brewster in the principalship of the United College of St\r\nAndrews, a position which he held until his death at Clifton on the 31st\r\nof December 1868.\r\n\r\nAs a scientific investigator he is best known for his researches on heat\r\nand on glaciers. Between 1836 and 1844 he published in the _Trans. Roy.\r\nSoc. Ed._ four series of \"Researches on Heat,\" in the course of which he\r\ndescribed the polarization of heat by tourmaline, by transmission\r\nthrough a bundle of thin mica plates inclined to the transmitted ray,\r\nand by reflection from the multiplied surfaces of a pile of mica plates\r\nplaced at the polarizing angle, and also its circular polarization by\r\ntwo internal reflections in rhombs of rock-salt. His work won him the\r\nRumford medal of the Royal Society in 1838, and in 1843 he received its\r\nRoyal medal for a paper on the \"Transparency of the Atmosphere and the\r\nLaws of Extinction of the Sun's Rays passing through it.\" In 1846 he\r\nbegan experiments on the temperature of the earth at different depths\r\nand in different soils near Edinburgh, which yielded determinations of\r\nthe thermal conductivity of trap-tufa, sandstone and pure loose sand.\r\nTowards the end of his life he was occupied with experimental inquiries\r\ninto the laws of the conduction of heat in bars, and his last piece of\r\nwork was to show that the thermal conductivity of iron diminishes with\r\nincrease of temperature. His attention was directed to the question of\r\nthe flow of glaciers in 1840 when he met Louis Agassiz at the Glasgow\r\nmeeting of the British Association, and in subsequent years he made\r\nseveral visits to Switzerland and also to Norway for the purpose of\r\nobtaining accurate data. His observations led him to the view that a\r\nglacier is an imperfect fluid or a viscous body which is urged down\r\nslopes of a certain inclination by the mutual pressure of its parts, and\r\ninvolved him in some controversy with Tyndall and others both as to\r\npriority and to scientific principle. Forbes was also interested in\r\ngeology, and published memoirs on the thermal springs of the Pyrenees,\r\non the extinct volcanoes of the Vivarais (Ardeche), on the geology of\r\nthe Cuchullin and Eildon hills, &c. In addition to about 150 scientific\r\npapers, he wrote _Travels through the Alps of Savoy and Other Parts of\r\nthe Pennine Chain, with Observations on the Phenomena of Glaciers_\r\n(1843); _Norway and its Glaciers_ (1853); _Occasional Papers on the\r\nTheory of Glaciers_ (1859); _A Tour of Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa_\r\n(1855). He was also the author (1852) of the \"Dissertation on the\r\nProgress of Mathematical and Physical Science,\" published in the 8th\r\nedition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n  See _Forbes's Life and Letters_, by Principal Shairp, Professor P.G.\r\n  Tait and A. Adams-Reilly (1873); _Professor Forbes and his\r\n  Biographers_, by J. Tyndall (1873).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, SIR JOHN (1787-1861), British physician, was born at Cuttlebrae,\r\nBanffshire, in 1787. He attended the grammar school at Aberdeen, and\r\nafterwards entered Marischal College. After serving for nine years as a\r\nsurgeon in the navy, he graduated M.D. at Edinburgh in 1817, and then\r\nbegan to practise in Penzance, whence he removed to Chichester in 1822.\r\nHe took up his residence in London in 1840, and in the following year\r\nwas appointed physician to the royal household. He was knighted in 1853,\r\nand died on the 13th of November 1861 at Whitchurch in Berkshire. Sir\r\nJohn Forbes was better known as an author and editor than as a practical\r\nphysician. His works include the following:--_Original Cases ...\r\nillustrating the Use of the Stethoscope and Percussion in the Diagnosis\r\nof Diseases of the Chest_ (1824); _Illustrations of Modern Mesmerism_\r\n(1845); _A Physician's Holiday_ (1st ed., 1849); _Memorandums made in\r\nIreland in the Autumn of 1852_ (2 vols., 1853); _Sightseeing in Germany\r\nand the Tyrol in the Autumn of 1855_ (1856). He was joint editor with A.\r\nTweedie and J. Conolly of _The Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine_ (4\r\nvols., 1833-1835); and in 1836 he founded the _British and Foreign\r\nMedical Review_, which, after a period of prosperity, involved its\r\neditor in pecuniary loss, and was discontinued in 1847, partly in\r\nconsequence of the advocacy in its later numbers of doctrines obnoxious\r\nto the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES, a municipal town of Ashburnham county, New South Wales,\r\nAustralia, 289 m. W. by N. from Sydney, on the Lachlan river, and with a\r\nstation on the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 4313. Its importance\r\nas a commercial centre is due to its advantageous position between the\r\nnorthern and southern markets. It has steam-sawing and flour-mills,\r\nbreweries and wool-scouring establishments; while the surrounding\r\ncountry produces good quantities of cereals, lucerne, wine and fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES-ROBERTSON, JOHNSTON (1853- ), English actor, was the son of John\r\nForbes-Robertson of Aberdeen, an art critic. He was educated at\r\nCharterhouse, and studied at the Royal Academy schools with a view to\r\nbecoming a painter. But though he kept up his interest in that art, in\r\n1874 he turned to the theatre, making his first appearance in London as\r\nChastelard, in _Mary, Queen of Scots_. He studied under Samuel Phelps,\r\nfrom whom he learnt the traditions of the tragic stage. He played with\r\nthe Bancrofts and with John Hare, supported Miss Mary Anderson in both\r\nEngland and America, and also acted at different times with Sir Henry\r\nIrving. His refined and artistic style, and beautiful voice and\r\nelocution made him a marked man on the English stage, and in Pinero's\r\n_The Profligate_ at the Garrick theatre (1889), under Hare's management,\r\nhe established his position as one of the most individual of London\r\nactors. In 1895 he started under his own management at the Lyceum with\r\nMrs Patrick Campbell, producing _Romeo and Juliet_, _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_\r\nand also some modern plays; his impersonation as Hamlet was especially\r\nfine, and his capacity as a romantic actor was shown to great advantage\r\nalso in John Davidson's _For the Crown_ and in Maeterlinck's _Pelleas\r\nand Melisande_. In 1900 he married the actress Gertrude Elliott, with\r\nwhom, as his leading lady, he appeared at various theatres, producing in\r\nsubsequent years _The Light that Failed_, Madeleine Lucette Riley's\r\n_Mice and Men_, and G. Bernard Shaw's _Caesar and Cleopatra_, Jerome K.\r\nJerome's _Passing of the Third Floor Back_, &c. His brothers, Ian\r\nRobertson (b. 1858) and Norman Forbes (b. 1859), had also been\r\nwell-known actors from about 1878 onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBIN, CLAUDE DE (1656-1733), French naval commander, was born in\r\nProvence, of a family of high standing, in 1656. High-spirited and\r\nungovernable in his boyhood, he ran away from his home, and through the\r\ninfluence of an uncle entered the navy, serving his first campaign in\r\n1675. For a short time he quitted the navy and entered the army, but\r\nsoon returned to his first choice. He made under D'Estrees the American\r\ncampaign, and under Duquesne that of Algiers in 1683, on all occasions\r\ndistinguishing himself by his impetuous courage. The most remarkable\r\nepisode of his life was his mission to Siam. During the administration\r\nof the Greek adventurer Phaulcon in that country, the project was formed\r\nof introducing the Christian religion and European civilization, and the\r\nking sent an embassy to Louis XIV. In response a French embassy was sent\r\nout, Forbin accompanying the chevalier de Chaumont with the rank of\r\nmajor. When Chaumont returned to France, Forbin was induced to remain in\r\nthe service of the Siamese king, and accepted, though with much\r\nreluctance, the posts of grand admiral, general of all the king's armies\r\nand governor of Bangkok. His position, however, was soon made untenable\r\nby the jealousy and intrigues of the minister Phaulcon; and at the end\r\nof two years he left Siam, reaching France in 1688. He was afterwards\r\nfully engaged in active service, first with Jean Bart in the war with\r\nEngland, when they were both captured and taken to Plymouth. They\r\nsucceeded in making their escape and were soon serving their country\r\nagain. Forbin was wounded at the battle of La Hogue, and greatly\r\ndistinguished himself at the battle of Lagos. He served under D'Estrees\r\nat the taking of Barcelona, was sent ambassador to Algiers, and in 1702\r\ntook a brilliant part in the Mediterranean in the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession. In 1706 he took command of a squadron at Dunkirk, and\r\ncaptured many valuable prizes from the Dutch and the English. In 1708 he\r\nwas entrusted with the command of the squadron which was to convey the\r\nPretender to Scotland; but so effectually were the coasts guarded by\r\nByng that the expedition failed, and returned to Dunkirk. Forbin was now\r\nbeginning to be weighed down with the infirmities of age and the toils\r\nof service, and in 1710 he retired to a country house near Marseilles.\r\nThere he spent part of his time in writing his memoirs, published in\r\n1730, which are full of interest and are written in a graphic and\r\nattractive style. Forbin died on the 4th of March 1733.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCELLINI, EGIDIO (1688-1768), Italian philologist, was born at Fener\r\nin the district of Treviso and belonged to a very poor family. He went\r\nto the seminary at Padua in 1704, studied under Facciolati, and in due\r\ncourse attained to the priesthood. From 1724 to 1731 he held the office\r\nof rector of the seminary at Ceneda, and from 1731 to 1765 that of\r\nfather confessor in the seminary of Padua. The remaining years of his\r\nlife were mainly spent in his native village. He died at Padua in 1768\r\nbefore the completion of the great work on which he had long co-operated\r\nwith Facciolati. This was the vast _Latin Lexicon_ (see FACCIOLATI),\r\nwhich has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been\r\npublished. He was engaged with his Herculean task for nearly 35 years,\r\nand the transcription of the manuscript by Luigi Violato occupied eight\r\nyears more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCHHAMMER, JOHANN GEORG (1794-1865), Danish mineralogist and\r\ngeologist, was born at Husum, Schleswig, on the 24th of July 1794, and\r\ndied at Copenhagen on the 14th of December 1865. After studying at Kiel\r\nand Copenhagen from 1815 to 1818, he joined Oersted and Lauritz Esmarch\r\nin their mineralogical exploration of Bornholm, and took a considerable\r\nshare in the labours of the expedition. In 1820 he obtained his doctor's\r\ndegree by a chemical treatise _De mangano_, and immediately after set\r\nout on a journey through England, Scotland and the Faeroe Islands. In\r\n1823 he was appointed lecturer at Copenhagen University on chemistry and\r\nmineralogy; in 1829 he obtained a similar post in the newly established\r\npolytechnic school; and in 1831 he was appointed professor of mineralogy\r\nin the university, and in 1848 became curator of the geological museum.\r\nFrom 1835 to 1837 he made many contributions to the geological survey of\r\nDenmark. On the death of H.C. Oersted in 1851, he succeeded him as\r\ndirector of the polytechnic school and secretary of the Academy of\r\nSciences. In 1850 he began with J. Steenstrup and Worsaae various\r\nanthropological publications which gained a high reputation. As a public\r\ninstructor Forchhammer held a high place and contributed potently to the\r\nprogress of his favourite studies in his native country. He interested\r\nhimself in such practical questions as the introduction of gas into\r\nCopenhagen, the establishment of the fire-brigade at Rosenberg and the\r\nboring of artesian wells.\r\n\r\n  Among his more important works are--_Loerebog i de enkelte Radicalers\r\n  Chemi_ (1842); _Danmarks geognostiske Forhold_ (1835); _Om de\r\n  Bornholmske Kulformationer_ (1836); _Dit myere Kridt i Danmark_\r\n  (1847); _Bidrag til Skildringen af Danmarks geographiske Forhold_\r\n  (1858). A list of his contributions to scientific periodicals, Danish,\r\n  English and German, will be found in the _Catalogue of Scientific\r\n  Papers_ published by the Royal Society of London. One of the most\r\n  interesting and most recent is \"On the Constitution of Sea Water at\r\n  Different Depths and in Different Latitudes,\" in the _Proceedings of\r\n  the Roy. Soc._ xii. (1862-1863).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCHHAMMER, PETER WILHELM (1801-1894), German classical archaeologist,\r\nwas born at Husum in Schleswig on the 23rd of October 1801. He was\r\neducated at the Lubeck gymnasium and the university of Kiel, with which\r\nhe was connected for nearly 65 years. In 1830-1834 and 1838-1840 he\r\ntravelled in Italy, Greece, Asia Minor and Egypt. In 1843 he was\r\nappointed professor of philology at Kiel and director of the\r\narchaeological museum founded by himself in co-operation with Otto Jahn.\r\nHe died on the 8th of January 1894. Forchhammer was a democrat in the\r\nbest sense of the word, and from 1871 to 1873 represented the\r\nprogressive party of Schleswig-Holstein in the German Reichstag. His\r\npublished works deal chiefly with topography and ancient mythology. His\r\ntravels had convinced him that a full and comprehensive knowledge of\r\nclassical antiquity could only be acquired by a thorough acquaintance\r\nwith Greek and Roman monuments and works of art, and a detailed\r\nexamination of the topographical and climatic conditions of the chief\r\nlocalities of the ancient world. These principles are illustrated in his\r\n_Hellenika. Griechenland. Im Neuen das Alte_ (1837), which contains his\r\ntheory of the origin and explanation of the Greek myths, which he never\r\nabandoned, in spite of the attacks to which it was subjected. According\r\nto him, the myths arose from definite local (especially atmospheric and\r\naquatic) phenomena, and represented the annually recurring processes of\r\nnature as the acts of gods and heroes; thus, in _Achill_ (1853), the\r\nTrojan War is the winter conflict of the elements in that district.\r\nOther similar short treatises are: _Die Grundung Roms_ (1868);\r\n_Daduchos_ (1875), on the language of the myths and mythical buildings;\r\n_Die Wanderungen der Inachostochter Io_ (1880); _Prolegomena zur\r\nMythologie als Wissenschaft und Lexikon der Mythensprache_ (1891).\r\nAmongst his topographical works mention may be made of: _Topographie von\r\nAthen_ (1841); _Beschreibung der Ebene von Troja_ (1850), a commentary\r\non a map of the locality executed by T.A. Spratt (see _Journal of the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society_, xii., 1842); _Topographia Thebarum\r\nHeptapylarum_ (1854); _Erklarung der Ilias_ (1884), on the basis of the\r\ntopographical and physical peculiarities of the plain of Troy. His\r\n_Demokratenbuchlein_ (1849), in the main a discussion of the\r\nAristotelian theory of the state, and _Die Athener und Sokrates_ (1837),\r\nin which, contrary to the almost universal opinion, he upheld the\r\nprocedure of the Athenians as perfectly legal and their verdict as a\r\nperfectly just one, also deserve notice.\r\n\r\n  For a full list of his works see the obituary notice by E. Alberti in\r\n  C. Bursian's _Biographisches Jahrbuch fur Altertumskunde_, xx. (1897);\r\n  also J. Sass in _Allgemeine deutsche Biographie_, and A. Hoeck and\r\n  L.C. Pertsch, _P.W. Forchhammer_ (1898).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCHHEIM, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria, near the\r\nconfluence of the Wiesent and the Regnitz, 16 m. S.S.E. of Bamberg. Pop.\r\n(1905) 8417. It has four Roman Catholic churches, including the Gothic\r\nCollegiate church and a Protestant church. Among the other public\r\nbuildings are the progymnasium and an orphanage. The industries of the\r\ntown include spinning and weaving, bleaching and dyeing, bone and glue\r\nworks, brewing and paper-making. The spacious chateau occupies the site\r\nof the Carolingian palace which was destroyed in 1246.\r\n\r\nForchheim is of very early origin, having been the residence of the\r\nCarolingian sovereigns, including Charlemagne, in the 9th century.\r\nConsequently many diets were held here, and here also Conrad I. and\r\nLouis the Child were chosen German kings. The town was given by the\r\nemperor Henry II. in 1007 to the bishopric of Bamberg, and, except for a\r\nshort period during the 11th century, it remained in the possession of\r\nthe bishops until 1802, when it was ceded to Bavaria. In August 1796 a\r\nbattle took place near Forchheim between the French and the Austrians.\r\nThe fortifications of the town were dismantled in 1838.\r\n\r\n  See Hubsch, _Chronik der Stadt Forchheim_ (Nuremberg, 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORD, EDWARD ONSLOW (1852-1901), English sculptor, was born in London.\r\nHe received some education as a painter in Antwerp and as a sculptor in\r\nMunich under Professor Wagmuller, but was mainly self-taught. His first\r\ncontribution to the Royal Academy, in 1875, was a bust of his wife, and\r\nin portraiture he may be said to have achieved his greatest success. His\r\nbusts are always extremely refined and show his sitters at their best.\r\nThose (in bronze) of his fellow-artists Arthur Hacker (1894), Briton\r\nRiviere and Sir W.Q. Orchardson (1895), Sir L. Alma Tadema (1896), Sir\r\nHubert von Herkomer and Sir John Millais (1897), and of A.J. Balfour are\r\nall striking likenesses, and are equalled by that in marble of Sir\r\nFrederick Bramwell (for the Royal Institution) and by many more. He\r\ngained the open competition for the statue of Sir Rowland Hill, erected\r\nin 1882 outside the Royal Exchange, and followed it in 1883 with \"Henry\r\nIrving as Hamlet,\" now in the Guildhall art gallery. This seated statue,\r\ngood as it is, was soon surpassed by those of Dr Dale (1898, in the city\r\nmuseum, Birmingham) and Professor Huxley (1900), but the colossal\r\nmemorial statue of Queen Victoria (1901), for Manchester, was less\r\nsuccessful. The standing statue of W.E. Gladstone (1894, for the City\r\nLiberal Club, London) is to be regarded as one of Ford's better portrait\r\nworks. The colossal \"General Charles Gordon,\" camel-mounted, for\r\nChatham, \"Lord Strathnairn,\" an equestrian group for Knightsbridge, and\r\nthe \"Maharajah of Mysore\" (1900) comprise his larger works of the kind.\r\nA beautiful nude recumbent statue of Shelley (1892) upon a\r\ncleverly-designed base, which is not quite impeccable from the point of\r\nview of artistic taste, is at University College, Oxford, and a\r\nsimplified version was presented by him to be set up on the shore of\r\nViareggio, where the poet's body was washed up. Ford's ideal work has\r\ngreat charm and daintiness; his statue \"Folly\" (1886) was bought by the\r\ntrustees of the Chantrey Fund, and was followed by other statues or\r\nstatuettes of a similar order: \"Peace\" (1890), which secured his\r\nelection as an associate of the Royal Academy, \"Echo\" (1895), on which\r\nhe was elected full member, \"The Egyptian Singer\" (1889), \"Applause\"\r\n(1893), \"Glory to the Dead\" (1901) and \"Snowdrift\" (1902). Ford's\r\ninfluence on the younger generation of sculptors was considerable and of\r\ngood effect. His charming disposition rendered him extremely popular,\r\nand when he died a monument was erected to his memory (C. Lucchesi,\r\nsculptor, J.W. Simpson, architect) in St John's Wood, near to where he\r\ndwelt.\r\n\r\n  See SCULPTURE; also M.H. Spielmann, _British Sculpture and Sculptors\r\n  of To-day_ (London, 1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORD, JOHN (1586-c. 1640), English dramatist, was baptized on the 17th\r\nof April 1586 at Ilsington in north Devon. He came of a good family; his\r\nfather was in the commission of the peace and his mother was a sister of\r\nSir John Popham, successively attorney-general and lord chief justice.\r\nThe name of John Ford appears in the university register of Oxford as\r\nmatriculating at Exeter College in 1601. Like a cousin and namesake (to\r\nwhom, with other members of the society of Gray's Inn, he dedicated his\r\nplay of _The Lover's Melancholy_), the future dramatist entered the\r\nprofession of the law, being admitted of the Middle Temple in 1602; but\r\nhe seems never to have been called to the bar. Four years afterwards he\r\nmade his first appearance as an author with an elegy called _Fame's\r\nMemorial, or the Earl of Devonshire deceased_, and dedicated to the\r\nwidow of the earl (Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, \"coronized,\" to use\r\nFord's expression, by King James in 1603 for his services in Ireland)--a\r\nlady who would have been no unfitting heroine for one of his own\r\ntragedies of lawless passion, the famous Penelope, formerly Lady Rich.\r\nThis panegyric, which is accompanied by a series of epitaphs and is\r\ncomposed in a strain of fearless extravagance, was, as the author\r\ndeclares, written \"unfee'd\"; it shows that Ford sympathized, as\r\nShakespeare himself is supposed to have done, with the \"awkward fate\" of\r\nthe countess's brother, the earl of Essex. Who the \"flint-hearted Lycia\"\r\nmay be, to whom the poet seems to allude as his own disdainful mistress,\r\nis unknown; indeed, the record of Ford's private life is little better\r\nthan a blank. To judge, however, from the dedications, prologues and\r\nepilogues of his various plays, he seems to have enjoyed the patronage\r\nof the earl, afterwards duke, of Newcastle, \"himself a muse\" after a\r\nfashion, and Lord Craven, the supposed husband of the ex-queen of\r\nBohemia. Ford's tract of _Honor Triumphant, or the Peeres Challenge_\r\n(printed 1606 and reprinted by the Shakespeare Society with the _Line of\r\nLife_, in 1843), and the simultaneously published verses _The Monarches\r\nMeeting, or the King of Denmarkes Welcome into England_, exhibit him as\r\noccasionally meeting the festive demands of court and nobility; and a\r\nkind of moral essay by him, entitled _A Line of Life_ (printed 1620),\r\nwhich contains references to Raleigh, ends with a climax of fulsome\r\npraise to the address of King James I. Yet at least one of Ford's plays\r\n(_The Broken Heart_, iii. 4) contains an implied protest against the\r\nabsolute system of government generally accepted by the dramatists of\r\nthe early Stuart reigns. Of his relations with his brother-authors\r\nlittle is known; it was natural that he should exchange complimentary\r\nverses with James Shirley, and that he should join in the chorus of\r\nlaments over the death of Ben Jonson. It is more interesting to notice\r\nan epigram in honour of Ford by Richard Crashaw, morbidly passionate in\r\none direction as Ford was in another. The lines run:\r\n\r\n  \"Thou cheat'st us, Ford; mak'st one seem two by art:\r\n   What is Love's Sacrifice but the Broken Heart?\"\r\n\r\nIt has been concluded that in the latter part of his life he gratified\r\nthe tendency to seclusion for which he was ridiculed in _The Time Poets_\r\n(_Choice Drollery_, 1656) by withdrawing from business and from literary\r\nlife in London, to his native place; but nothing is known as to the date\r\nof his death. His career as a dramatist very probably began by\r\ncollaboration with other authors. With Thomas Dekker he wrote _The Fairy\r\nKnight_ and _The Bristowe Merchant_ (licensed in 1624, but both\r\nunpublished), with John Webster _A late Murther of the Sonne upon the\r\nMother_ (licensed in 1624). A play entitled _An ill Beginning has a good\r\nEnd_, brought on the stage as early as 1613 and attributed to Ford, was\r\n(if his) his earliest acted play; whether _Sir Thomas Overbury's Life\r\nand untimely Death_ (1615) was a play is extremely doubtful; some lines\r\nof indignant regret by Ford on the same subject are still preserved. He\r\nis also said to have written, at dates unknown, _The London Merchant_\r\n(which, however, was an earlier name for Beaumont and Fletcher's _Knight\r\nof the Burning Pestle_) and _The Royal Combat_; a tragedy by him,\r\n_Beauty in a Trance_, was entered in the Stationers' Register in 1653,\r\nbut never printed. These three (or four) plays were among those\r\ndestroyed by Warburton's cook. _The Queen, or the Excellency of the\r\nSea_, a play of inverted passion, containing some fine sensuous lines,\r\nprinted in 1653 by Alexander Singhe for private performance, has been\r\nrecently edited by W. Bang (_Materialien zur Kunde d. alteren engl.\r\nDramas_, 13, Louvain, 1906), and is by him on internal evidence\r\nconfidently claimed as Ford's. Of the plays by Ford preserved to us the\r\ndates span little more than a decade--the earliest, _The Lover's\r\nMelancholy_, having been acted in 1628 and printed in 1629, the latest,\r\n_The Lady's Trial_, acted in 1638 and printed in 1639.\r\n\r\nWhen writing _The Lover's Melancholy_, it would seem that Ford had not\r\nyet become fully aware of the bent of his own dramatic genius, although\r\nhe was already master of his powers of poetic expression. He was\r\nattracted towards domestic tragedy by an irresistible desire to sound\r\nthe depths of abnormal conflicts between passion and circumstances, to\r\nromantic comedy by a strong though not widely varied imaginative\r\nfaculty, and by a delusion that he was possessed of abundant comic\r\nhumour. In his next two works, undoubtedly those most characteristically\r\nexpressive of his peculiar strength, _'Tis Pity she's a Whore_ (acted c.\r\n1626) and _The Broken Heart_ (acted c. 1629), both printed in 1633 with\r\nthe anagram of his name _Fide Honor_, he had found horrible situations\r\nwhich required dramatic explanation by intensely powerful motives. Ford\r\nby no means stood alone among English dramatists in his love of abnormal\r\nsubjects; but few were so capable of treating them sympathetically, and\r\nyet without that reckless grossness or extravagance of expression which\r\nrenders the morally repulsive aesthetically intolerable, or converts the\r\nhorrible into the grotesque. For in Ford's genius there was real\r\nrefinement, except when the \"supra-sensually sensual\" impulse or the\r\nhumbler self-delusion referred to came into play. In a third tragedy,\r\n_Love's Sacrifice_ (acted c. 1630; printed in 1633), he again worked on\r\nsimilar materials; but this time he unfortunately essayed to base the\r\ninterest of his plot upon an unendurably unnatural possibility--doing\r\nhomage to virtue after a fashion which is in itself an insult. In\r\n_Perkin Warbeck_ (printed 1634; probably acted a year later) he chose an\r\nhistorical subject of great dramatic promise and psychological interest,\r\nand sought to emulate the glory of the great series of Shakespeare's\r\nnational histories. The effort is one of the most laudable, as it was by\r\nno means one of the least successful, in the dramatic literature of this\r\nperiod. _The Fancies Chaste and Noble_ (acted before 1636, printed\r\n1638), though it includes scenes of real force and feeling, is\r\ndramatically a failure, of which the main idea is almost provokingly\r\nslight and feeble; and _The Lady's Trial_ (acted 1638, printed 1639) is\r\nonly redeemed from utter wearisomeness by an unusually even pleasingness\r\nof form. There remain two other dramatic works, of very different kinds,\r\nin which Ford co-operated with other writers, the mask of _The Sun's\r\nDarling_ (acted 1624, printed 1657), hardly to be placed in the first\r\nrank of early compositions, and _The Witch of Edmonton_ (printed 1658,\r\nbut probably acted about 1621), in which we see Ford as a joint writer\r\nwith Dekker and Rowley of one of the most powerful domestic dramas of\r\nthe English or any other stage.\r\n\r\n  A few notes may be added on some of the more remarkable of the plays\r\n  enumerated. A wholly baseless anecdote, condensed into a stinging\r\n  epigram by Endymion Porter, asserted that _The Lover's Melancholy_ was\r\n  stolen by Ford from Shakespeare's papers. Undoubtedly, the madness of\r\n  the hero of this play of Ford's occasionally recalls Hamlet, while the\r\n  heroine is one of the many, and at the same time one of the most\r\n  pleasing, parallels to Viola. But neither of them is a copy, as Friar\r\n  Bonaventura in Ford's second play may be said to be a copy of Friar\r\n  Lawrence, whose kindly pliability he disagreeably exaggerates, or as\r\n  D'Avolos in _Love's Sacrifice_ is clearly modelled on Iago. The plot\r\n  of _The Lover's Melancholy_, which is ineffective because it leaves no\r\n  room for suspense in the mind of the reader, seems original; in the\r\n  dialogue, on the other hand, a justly famous passage in Act i. (the\r\n  beautiful version of the story of the nightingale's death) is\r\n  translated from Strada; while the scheme of the tedious interlude\r\n  exhibiting the various forms of madness is avowedly taken, together\r\n  with sundry comments, from Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_. Already\r\n  in this play Ford exhibits the singular force of his pathos; the\r\n  despondent misery of the aged Meleander, and the sweetness of the last\r\n  scene, in which his daughter comes back to him, alike go to the heart.\r\n  A situation--hazardous in spite of its comic substratum--between\r\n  Thaumasta and the pretended Parthenophil is conducted, as Gifford\r\n  points out, with real delicacy; but the comic scenes are merely stagy,\r\n  notwithstanding, or by reason of, the effort expended on them by the\r\n  author.\r\n\r\n  _'Tis Pity she's a Whore_ has been justly recognized as a tragedy of\r\n  extraordinary power. Mr Swinburne, in his eloquent essay on Ford, has\r\n  rightly shown what is the meaning of this tragedy, and has at the same\r\n  time indicated wherein consists its poison. He dwells with great force\r\n  upon the different treatment applied by Ford to the characters of the\r\n  two miserable lovers--brother and sister. \"The sin once committed,\r\n  there is no more wavering or flinching possible to him, who has fought\r\n  so hard against the demoniac possession; while she who resigned body\r\n  and soul to the tempter, almost at a word, remains liable to the\r\n  influences of religion and remorse.\" This different treatment shows\r\n  the feeling of the poet--the feeling for which he seeks to evoke our\r\n  inmost sympathy--to oscillate between the belief that an awful crime\r\n  brings with it its awful punishment (and it is sickening to observe\r\n  how the argument by which the Friar persuades Annabella to forsake her\r\n  evil courses mainly appeals to the physical terrors of retribution),\r\n  and the notion that there is something fatal, something irresistible,\r\n  and therefore in a sense self-justified, in so dominant a passion. The\r\n  key-note to the conduct of Giovanni lies in his words at the close of\r\n  the first scene--\r\n\r\n    \"All this I'll do, to free me from the rod\r\n     Of vengeance; _else I'll swear my fate's my god_.\"\r\n\r\n  Thus there is no solution of the conflict between passion on the one\r\n  side, and law, duty and religion on the other; and passion triumphs,\r\n  in the dying words of \"the student struck blind and mad by passion\"--\r\n\r\n             \"O, I bleed fast!\r\n    Death, thou'rt a guest long look'd for; I embrace\r\n    Thee and thy wounds: O, my last minute comes!\r\n    Where'er I go, let me enjoy this grace\r\n    Freely to view my Annabella's face.\"\r\n\r\n  It has been observed by J.A. Symonds that \"English poets have given us\r\n  the right key to the Italian temperament.... The love of Giovanni and\r\n  Annabella is rightly depicted as more imaginative than sensual.\" It is\r\n  difficult to allow the appositeness of this special illustration; on\r\n  the other hand, Ford has even in this case shown his art of depicting\r\n  sensual passion without grossness of expression; for the exception in\r\n  Annabella's language to Soranzo seems to have a special intention, and\r\n  is true to the pressure of the situation and the revulsion produced by\r\n  it in a naturally weak and yielding mind. The entire atmosphere, so to\r\n  speak, of the play is stifling, and is not rendered less so by the\r\n  underplot with Hippolita.\r\n\r\n  _'Tis Pity she's a Whore_ was translated into French by Maurice\r\n  Maeterlinck under the title of _Annabella_, and represented at the\r\n  Theatre de l'Oeuvre in 1894. The translator prefixes to the version an\r\n  eloquent appreciation of Ford's genius, especially in his portraits of\r\n  women, whose fate it is to live \"dans les tenebres, les craintes et\r\n  les larmes.\"\r\n\r\n  Like this tragedy, _The Broken Heart_ was probably founded upon some\r\n  Italian or other novel of the day; but since in the latter instance\r\n  there is nothing revolting in the main idea of the subject, the play\r\n  commends itself as the most enjoyable, while, in respect of many\r\n  excellences, an unsurpassed specimen of Ford's dramatic genius. The\r\n  complicated plot is constructed with greater skill than is usual with\r\n  this dramatist, and the pathos of particular situations, and of the\r\n  entire character of Penthea--a woman doomed to hopeless misery, but\r\n  capable of seeking to obtain for her brother a happiness which his\r\n  cruelty has condemned her to forego--has an intensity and a depth\r\n  which are all Ford's own. Even the lesser characters are more pleasing\r\n  than usual, and some beautiful lyrics are interspersed in the play.\r\n\r\n  Of the other plays written by Ford alone, only _The Chronicle Historie\r\n  of Perkin Warbeck. A Strange Truth_, appears to call for special\r\n  attention. A repeated perusal of this drama suggests the judgment that\r\n  it is overpraised when ranked at no great distance from Shakespeare's\r\n  national dramas. Historical truth need not be taken into consideration\r\n  in the matter; and if, notwithstanding James Gairdner's essay appended\r\n  to his _Life and Reign of Richard III._, there are still credulous\r\n  persons left to think and assert that Perkin was not an impostor, they\r\n  will derive little satisfaction from Ford's play, which with really\r\n  surprising skill avoids the slightest indication as to the poet's own\r\n  belief on the subject. That this tragedy should have been reprinted in\r\n  1714 and acted in 1745 only shows that the public, as is often the\r\n  case, had an eye to the catastrophe rather than to the development of\r\n  the action. The dramatic capabilities of the subject are, however,\r\n  great, and it afterwards attracted Schiller, who, however, seems to\r\n  have abandoned it in favour of the similar theme of the Russian\r\n  Demetrius. Had Shakespeare treated it, he would hardly have contented\r\n  himself with investing the hero with the nobility given by Ford to\r\n  this personage of his play,--for it is hardly possible to speak of a\r\n  personage as a _character_ when the clue to his conduct is\r\n  intentionally withheld. Nor could Shakespeare have failed to bring out\r\n  with greater variety and distinctness the dramatic features in Henry\r\n  VII., whom Ford depicts with sufficient distinctness to give some\r\n  degree of individuality to the figure, but still with a tenderness of\r\n  touch which would have been much to the credit of the dramatist's\r\n  skill had he been writing in the Tudor age. The play is, however,\r\n  founded on Bacon's Life, of which the text is used by Ford with\r\n  admirable discretion, and on Thomas Gainsford's _True and Wonderful\r\n  History of Perkin Warbeck_ (1618). The minor characters of the honest\r\n  old Huntley, whom the Scottish king obliges to bestow his daughter's\r\n  hand upon Warbeck, and of her lover the faithful \"Dalyell,\" are most\r\n  effectively drawn; even \"the men of judgment,\" the adventurers who\r\n  surround the chief adventurer, are spirited sketches, and the Irishman\r\n  among them has actually some humour; while the style of the play is,\r\n  as befits a \"Chronicle History,\" so clear and straightforward as to\r\n  make it easy as well as interesting to read.\r\n\r\n  _The Witch of Edmonton_ was attributed by its publisher to William\r\n  Rowley, Dekker, Ford, \"&c.,\" but the body of the play has been\r\n  generally held to be ascribable to Ford and Dekker only. The subject\r\n  of the play was no doubt suggested by the case of the reported witch,\r\n  Elizabeth Sawyer, who was executed in 1621. Swinburne agrees with\r\n  Gifford in thinking Ford the author of the whole of the first act; and\r\n  he is most assuredly right in considering that \"there is no more\r\n  admirable exposition of a play on the English stage.\" Supposing Dekker\r\n  to be chiefly responsible for the scenes dealing with the unfortunate\r\n  old woman whom persecution as a witch actually drives to become one,\r\n  and Ford for the domestic tragedy of the bigamist murderer, it cannot\r\n  be denied that both divisions of the subject are effectively treated,\r\n  while the more important part of the task fell to the share of Ford.\r\n  Yet it may be doubted whether any such division can be safely assumed;\r\n  and it may suffice to repeat that no domestic tragedy has ever taught\r\n  with more effective simplicity and thrilling truthfulness the homely\r\n  double lesson of the folly of selfishness and the mad rashness of\r\n  crime.\r\n\r\n  With Dekker Ford also wrote the mask of _The Sun's Darling_; or, as\r\n  seems most probable, they founded this production upon _Phaeton_, an\r\n  earlier mask, of which Dekker had been sole author. Gifford holds that\r\n  Dekker's hand is perpetually traceable in the first three acts of _The\r\n  Sun's Darling_, and through the whole of its comic part, but that the\r\n  last two acts are mainly Ford's. If so, he is the author of the rather\r\n  forced occasional tribute on the accession of King Charles I., of\r\n  which the last act largely consists. This mask, which furnished\r\n  abundant opportunities for the decorators, musicians and dancers, in\r\n  showing forth how the seasons and their delights are successively\r\n  exhausted by a \"wanton darling,\" Raybright the grandchild of the Sun,\r\n  is said to have been very popular. It is at the same time commonplace\r\n  enough in conception; but there is much that is charming in the\r\n  descriptions, Jonson and Lyly being respectively laid under\r\n  contribution in the course of the dialogue, and in one of the\r\n  incidental lyrics.\r\n\r\nFord owes his position among English dramatists to the intensity of his\r\npassion, in particular scenes and passages where the character, the\r\nauthor and the reader are alike lost in the situation and in the\r\nsentiment evoked by it; and this gift is a supreme dramatic gift. But\r\nhis plays--with the exception of _The Witch of Edmonton_, in which he\r\ndoubtless had a prominent share--too often disturb the mind like a bad\r\ndream which ends as an unsolved dissonance; and this defect is a supreme\r\ndramatic defect. It is not the rigid or the stolid who have the most\r\nreason to complain of the insufficiency of tragic poetry such as Ford's;\r\nnor is it that morality only which, as Ithocles says in _The Broken\r\nHeart_, \"is formed of books and school-traditions,\" which has a right to\r\nprotest against the final effect of the most powerful creations of his\r\ngenius. There is a morality which both\r\n\r\n        \"Keeps the soul in tune,\r\n  At whose sweet music all our actions dance,\"\r\n\r\nand is able to physic\r\n\r\n      \"The sickness of a mind\r\n  Broken with griefs.\"\r\n\r\nOf that morality--or of that deference to the binding power within man\r\nand the ruling power above him--tragedy is the truest expounder, even\r\nwhen it illustrates by contrasts; but the tragic poet who merely places\r\nthe problem before us, and bids us stand aghast with him at its cruelty,\r\nis not to be reckoned among the great masters of a divine art.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The best edition of Ford is that by Gifford, with notes\r\n  and introduction, revised with additions to both text and notes by\r\n  Alexander Dyce (1869). An edition of the _Dramatic Works of Massinger\r\n  and Ford_ appeared in 1840, with an introduction by Hartley Coleridge.\r\n  _The Best Plays of Ford_ were edited for the \"Mermaid Series\" in 1888,\r\n  with an introduction by W.H. Havelock Ellis, and reissued in 1903.\r\n  A.C. Swinburne's \"Essay on Ford\" is reprinted among his _Essays and\r\n  Studies_ (1875). _Perkin Warbeck_ and _'Tis Pity_ were translated into\r\n  German by F. Bodenstedt in 1860; and the latter again by F. Blei in\r\n  1904. The probable sources of the various plays are discussed in Emil\r\n  Koeppel's _Quellenstudien zu den Dramen George Chapman's, Philip\r\n  Massinger's und John Ford's_ (1897).     (A. W. W.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORD, RICHARD (1796-1858), English author of one of the earliest and\r\nbest of travellers' _Handbooks_, was the eldest son of Sir Richard Ford,\r\nwho in 1789 was member of parliament for East Grinstead, and for many\r\nyears afterwards chief police magistrate of London. His mother was the\r\ndaughter and heiress of Benjamin Booth, a distinguished connoisseur in\r\nart. He was called to the bar, but never practised, and in 1830-1833 he\r\ntravelled in Spain, spending much of his time in the Alhambra and at\r\nSeville. His first literary work (other than contributions to the\r\n_Quarterly Review_) was a pamphlet, _An Historical Inquiry into the\r\nUnchangeable Character of a War in Spain_ (Murray, 1837), in reply to\r\none called the _Policy of England towards Spain_, issued under the\r\npatronage of Lord Palmerston. He spent the winter of 1839-1840 in Italy,\r\nwhere he added largely to his collection of majolica; and soon after his\r\nreturn he began, at John Murray's invitation, to write his _Handbook for\r\nTravellers in Spain_, with which his name is chiefly associated. He died\r\non the 1st of September 1858, leaving a fine private collection of\r\npictures to his widow (d. 1910), his third wife, a daughter of Sir A.\r\nMolesworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORD, THOMAS (b. c. 1580), English musician, of whose life little more\r\nis known than that he was attached to the court of Prince Henry, son of\r\nJames I. His works also are few, but they are sufficient to show the\r\nhigh stage of efficiency and musical knowledge which the English school\r\nhad attained at the beginning of the 17th century. They consist of\r\ncanons and other concerted pieces of vocal music, mostly with lute\r\naccompaniment. The chief collection of his works is entitled _Musike of\r\nSundrie Kinds set forth in Two Books_, &c. (1607), and the histories of\r\nmusic by Burney and Hawkins give specimens of his art. Together with\r\nDowland, immortalized in one of Shakespeare's sonnets, Ford is the chief\r\nrepresentative of the school which preceded Henry Lawes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORDE, FRANCIS (d. 1770), British soldier, first appears in the army\r\nlist as a captain in the 39th Foot in 1746. This regiment was the first\r\nof the king's service to serve in India (hence its motto _Primus in\r\nIndis_), and Forde was on duty there when in 1755 he became major, at\r\nthe same time as Eyre Coote, soon to become his rival, was promoted\r\ncaptain. At the express invitation of Clive, Forde resigned his king's\r\ncommission to take the post of second in command of the E.I. Company's\r\ntroops in Bengal. Soon after Plassey, Forde was sent against the French\r\nof Masulipatam. Though feebly supported by the motley rabble of an army\r\nwhich Anandraz, the local ally, brought into the field, Forde pushed\r\nahead through difficult country and came upon the enemy entrenched at\r\nCondore. For four days the two armies faced one another; on the fifth\r\nboth commanders resolved on the offensive and an encounter ensued. In\r\nspite of the want of spirit shown by Anandraz and his men, Forde in the\r\nend succeeded in winning the battle, which was from first to last a\r\nbrilliant piece of work. Nor did he content himself with this; on the\r\nsame evening he stormed the French camp, and his pursuit was checked\r\nonly by the guns of Masulipatam itself. The place was quickly invested\r\non the land side, but difficulties crowded upon Forde and his handful of\r\nmen. For fifty days little advance was made; then Forde, seeing the last\r\navenues of escape closing behind him, ordered an assault at midnight on\r\nthe 25th of January 1759. The Company's troops lost one-third of their\r\nnumber, but the storm was a brilliant and astounding success. Forde\r\nreceived less than no reward. The Company refused to confirm his\r\nlieut.-colonel's commission, and he found himself junior to Eyre Coote,\r\nhis old subaltern in the 39th Foot. Nevertheless he continued to assist\r\nClive, and on the 25th of November 1759 won a success comparable to\r\nCondore at Chinsurah (or Biderra) against the Dutch. A year later he at\r\nlast received his commission, but was still opposed by a faction of the\r\ndirectors which supported Coote. Clive himself warmly supported Forde in\r\nthese quarrels. In 1769, with Vansittart and Scrafton, Colonel Forde was\r\nsent out with full powers to investigate every detail of Indian\r\nadministration. Their ship was never heard of after leaving the Cape of\r\nGood Hope on the 27th of December.\r\n\r\n  Monographs on Condore, Masulipatam and Chinsurah will be found in\r\n  Malleson's _Decisive Battles of India_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORDHAM, formerly a village of Westchester county, New York, U.S.A., and\r\nnow a part of New York City. It lies on the mainland, along the eastern\r\nbank of the Harlem river, E. of the northern end of Manhattan Island. It\r\nis the seat of Fordham University (Roman Catholic), founded in 1841 as\r\nSt John's College, and since 1846 conducted by the Society of Jesus. In\r\n1907 the institution was rechartered as Fordham University, and now\r\nincludes St John's College high school and grammar school, St John's\r\nCollege, the Fordham University medical school (all in Fordham), and the\r\nFordham University law school (42 Broadway, New York City). In 1907-1908\r\nthe university had 96 instructors and (exclusive of 364 students in the\r\nhigh school) 236 students, of whom 105 were in St John's College, 31 in\r\nthe medical school, and 100 in the law school. In Fordham still stands\r\nthe house in which Edgar Allan Poe lived from 1844 to 1849 and in which\r\nhe wrote \"Annabel Lee,\" \"Ulalume,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Fordham was established in 1669 by Jan Arcer (a Dutchman,\r\nwho called himself \"John Archer\" after coming to America), who in that\r\nyear received permission from Francis Lovelace, colonial governor of New\r\nYork, to settle sixteen families on the mainland close by a\r\nfording-place of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek, near where that stream enters\r\nthe Harlem river. Between 1655 and 1671 Archer bought from the Indians\r\nthe tract of land lying between Spuyten Duyvil Creek and the Harlem\r\nriver on the east and the Bronx river on the west, and extending from\r\nthe hamlet of Fordham to what is now High Bridge. In 1671 Governor\r\nLovelace erected this tract into the manor of Fordham. In 1846 it was\r\nincluded with Morrisania in the township of West Farms; and in 1872 with\r\npart of the township of Yonkers was erected into the township of\r\nKingsbridge, which in 1874 was annexed to the city of New York, and in\r\n1898 became a part of the borough of the Bronx, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORDUN, JOHN OF (d. c. 1384), Scottish chronicler. The statement\r\ngenerally made that the chronicler was born at Fordoun (Kincardineshire)\r\nhas not been supported by any direct evidence. It is certain that he was\r\na secular priest, and that he composed his history in the latter part of\r\nthe 14th century; and it is probable that he was a chaplain in the\r\ncathedral of Aberdeen. The work of Fordun is the earliest attempt to\r\nwrite a continuous history of Scotland. We are informed that Fordun's\r\npatriotic zeal was roused by the removal or destruction of many national\r\nrecords by Edward III. and that he travelled in England and Ireland,\r\ncollecting material for his history. This work is divided into five\r\nbooks. The first three are almost entirely fabulous, and form the\r\ngroundwork on which Boece and Buchanan afterwards based their historical\r\nfictions, which were exposed by Thomas Innes in his _Critical Essay_ (i.\r\npp. 201-214). The 4th and 5th books, though still mixed with fable,\r\ncontain much valuable information, and become more authentic the more\r\nnearly they approach the author's own time. The 5th book concludes with\r\nthe death of King David I. in 1153. Besides these five books, Fordun\r\nwrote part of another book, and collected materials for bringing down\r\nthe history to a later period. These materials were used by a\r\ncontinuator who wrote in the middle of the 15th century, and who is\r\nidentified with Walter Bower (q.v.), abbot of the monastery of Inchcolm.\r\nThe additions of Bower form eleven books, and bring down the narrative\r\nto the death of King James I. in 1437. According to the custom of the\r\ntime, the continuator did not hesitate to interpolate Fordun's portion\r\nof the work with additions of his own, and the whole history thus\r\ncompiled is known as the _Scotichronicon_.\r\n\r\n  The first printed edition of Fordun's work was that of Thomas Gale in\r\n  his _Scriptores quindecim_ (vol. iii.), which was published in 1691.\r\n  This was followed by Thomas Hearne's (5 vols.) edition in 1722. The\r\n  whole work, including Bower's continuation, was published by Walter\r\n  Goodall at Edinburgh in 1759. In 1871 and 1872 Fordun's chronicle, in\r\n  the original Latin and in an English translation, was edited by\r\n  William F. Skene in _The Historians of Scotland_. The preface to this\r\n  edition collects all the biographical details and gives full\r\n  bibliographical references to MSS. and editions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORECLOSURE, in the law of mortgage, the extinguishment by order of the\r\ncourt of a mortgagor's equity of redemption. In the law of equity the\r\nobject of every mortgage transaction is eventually the repayment of a\r\ndebt, the mortgaged property being incidental by way of security.\r\nTherefore, although the day named for repayment of the loan has passed\r\nand the mortgagor's estate is consequently forfeited, equity steps in to\r\nmitigate the harshness of the common law, and will decree a reconveyance\r\nof the mortgaged property on payment of the principal, interest and\r\ncosts. This right of the mortgagor to relief is termed his \"equity of\r\nredemption.\" But the right must be exercised within a reasonable time,\r\notherwise he will be foreclosed his equity of redemption and the\r\nmortgagee's possession converted into an absolute ownership. Such\r\nforeclosure is enforced in equity by a foreclosure action. An action is\r\nbrought by the mortgagee against the mortgagor in the chancery division\r\nof the High Court in England, claiming that an account may be taken of\r\nthe principal and interest due to the mortgagee, and that the mortgagor\r\nmay be directed to pay the same, with costs, by a day to be appointed by\r\nthe court and that in default thereof he may be foreclosed his equity of\r\nredemption. English county courts have jurisdiction in foreclosure\r\nactions where the mortgage or charge does not exceed L500, or where the\r\nmortgage is for more than L500, but less than that sum has been actually\r\nadvanced. In a Welsh mortgage there is no right to foreclosure. (See\r\nalso MORTGAGE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, that department of the executive of the United Kingdom\r\nwhich is concerned with foreign affairs. The head of the Foreign Office\r\nis termed principal secretary of state for foreign affairs and his\r\noffice dates from 1782. Between that date and the Revolution there had\r\nbeen only two secretaries of state, whose duties were divided by a\r\ngeographical division of the globe into northern and southern\r\ndepartments. The duties of the secretary of the northern department of\r\nEurope comprised dealings with the northern powers of Europe, while the\r\nsecretary of the southern department of Europe communicated with France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, and also looked after Irish\r\nand colonial business, and carried out the work of the Home Office. In\r\n1782 the duties of these two secretaries were revised, the northern\r\ndepartment becoming the Foreign Office. The secretary for foreign\r\naffairs is the official agent of the crown in all communications between\r\nGreat Britain and foreign powers; his intercourse is carried on either\r\nthrough the representatives of foreign states in Great Britain or\r\nthrough representatives of Great Britain abroad. He negotiates all\r\ntreaties or alliances with foreign states, protects British subjects\r\nresiding abroad, and demands satisfaction for any injuries they may\r\nsustain at the hands of foreigners. He is assisted by two\r\nunder-secretaries of state (one of them a politician, the other a\r\npermanent civil servant), three assistant under-secretaries (civil\r\nservants), a librarian, a head of the treaty department and a staff of\r\nclerks. The departments of the Foreign Office are the African, American,\r\ncommercial and sanitary, consular, eastern (Europe), far eastern,\r\nwestern (Europe), parliamentary, financial, librarian and keeper of the\r\npapers, treaties and registry. In the case of important despatches and\r\ncorrespondence, these, with the drafts of answers, are sent first to the\r\npermanent under-secretary, then to the prime minister, then to the\r\nsovereign and, lastly, are circulated among the members of the cabinet.\r\nThe salary of the secretary for foreign affairs is L5000 per annum,\r\nthat of the permanent under-secretary L2000, the parliamentary\r\nunder-secretary and the first assistant under-secretary, L1500, and the\r\nother assistant under-secretaries L1200.\r\n\r\n  See Anson, _Law and Custom of the Constitution_, part ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORELAND, NORTH and SOUTH, two chalk headlands on the Kent coast of\r\nEngland, overlooking the Strait of Dover, the North Foreland forming the\r\neastern projection of the Isle of Thanet, and the South standing 3 m.\r\nN.E. of Dover. Both present bold cliffs to the sea, and command\r\nbeautiful views over the strait. On the North Foreland (51 deg. 22-1/2'\r\nN., 1 deg. 27' E.) there is a lighthouse, and on the South Foreland (51\r\ndeg. 8-1/2' N., 1 deg. 23' E.) there are two. There is also a Foreland\r\non the north coast of Devonshire, 2-1/2 m. N.E. of Lynmouth, a fine\r\nprojection of the highlands of Exmoor Forest, overlooking the Bristol\r\nChannel, and forming the most northerly point of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESHORE, that part of the seashore which lies between high- and\r\nlow-water mark at ordinary tides. In the United Kingdom it is ordinarily\r\nand prima facie vested in the crown, except where it may be vested in a\r\nsubject by ancient grant or charter from the crown, or by prescription.\r\nAlthough numerous decisions, dating from 1795, have confirmed the prima\r\nfacie title of the crown, S.A. Moore in his _History of the Foreshore_\r\ncontends that the presumption is in favour of the subject rather than of\r\nthe crown. But a subject can establish a title by proving an express\r\ngrant from the crown or giving sufficient evidence of user from which a\r\ngrant may be presumed. The chief acts showing title to foreshore are,\r\ntaking wreck or royal fish, right of fishing, mining, digging and taking\r\nsand, seaweed, &c., embanking and enclosing. There is a public right of\r\nuser in that part of the foreshore which belongs to the crown, for the\r\npurpose of navigation or fishery, but there is no right of passage over\r\nlands adjacent to the shore, except by a particular custom. So that, in\r\norder to make the right available, there must be a highway or other\r\npublic land giving access to the foreshore. Thus it has been held that\r\nthe public have no legal right to trespass on land above high-water mark\r\nfor the purpose of bathing in the sea, though if they can get to it they\r\nmay bathe there (_Blundell_ v. _Catteral_, 1821, 5 B. & Ad. 268). There\r\nis no right in the public to take sand, shells or seaweed from the\r\nshore, nor, except in certain places by local custom, have fishermen the\r\nright to use the foreshore or the soil above it for drawing up their\r\nboats, or for drying their nets or similar purposes.\r\n\r\n  See S.A. Moore, _History of the Foreshore and the Law relating\r\n  thereto_ (1888); Coulson and Forbes, _Law of Waters_ (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTALLING, in English criminal law, the offence of buying\r\nmerchandise, victual, &c., coming to market, or making any bargain for\r\nbuying the same, before they shall be in the market ready to be sold, or\r\nmaking any motion for enhancing the price, or dissuading any person from\r\ncoming to market or forbearing to bring any of the things to market, &c.\r\nSee ENGROSSING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST LAWS, the general term for the old English restriction laws,\r\ndealing with forests. One of the most cherished prerogatives of the king\r\nof England, at the time when his power was at the highest, was that of\r\nconverting any portion of the country into a forest in which he might\r\nenjoy the pleasures of the chase. The earliest struggles between the\r\nking and the people testify to the extent to which this prerogative\r\nbecame a public grievance, and the charter by which its exercise was\r\nbounded (Carta de Foresta) was in substance part of the greatest\r\nconstitutional code imposed by his barons upon King John. At common law\r\nit appears to have been the right of the king to make a forest where he\r\npleased, provided that certain legal formalities were observed. The king\r\nhaving a continual care for the preservation of the realm, and for the\r\npeace and quiet of his subjects, he had therefore amongst many\r\nprivileges this prerogative, viz. to have his place of recreation\r\nwheresoever he would appoint.[1] Land once afforested became subject to\r\na peculiar system of laws, which, as well as the formalities required to\r\nconstitute a valid afforestment, have been carefully ascertained by the\r\nAnglo-Norman lawyers. \"A forest,\" says Manwood, \"is a certain territory\r\nof woody grounds and fruitful pastures, privileged for wild beasts and\r\nfowls of forest, chase, and warren to rest, and abide there in the safe\r\nprotection of the king, for his delight and pleasure; which territory of\r\nground so privileged is mered and bounded with unremovable marks, meres\r\nand boundaries, either known by matter of record or by prescription; and\r\nalso replenished with wild beasts of venery or chase, and with great\r\ncoverts of vert, for the succour of the said beasts there to abide: for\r\nthe preservation and continuance of which said place, together with the\r\nvert and venison there are particular officers, laws, and privileges\r\nbelonging to the same, requisite for that purpose, and proper only to a\r\nforest and to no other place.\"[2] And the same author distinguishes a\r\nforest, as \"the highest franchise of princely pleasure,\" from the\r\ninferior franchises of chase, park and warren--named in the order of\r\ntheir importance. The forest embraces all these, and it is distinguished\r\nby having laws and courts of its own, according to which offenders are\r\njusticeable. An offender in a chase is to be punished by the common law;\r\nan offender in a forest by the forest law. A chase is much the same as a\r\npark, only the latter is enclosed, and all of them are distinguished\r\naccording to the class of wild beasts to which the privilege extended.\r\nThus beasts of forest (the \"five wild beasts of venery\") were the hart,\r\nthe hind, the hare, the boar and the wolf. The beasts of chase were also\r\nfive, viz. the buck, the doe, the fox, the marten and the roe. The\r\nbeasts and fowls of warren were the hare, the coney, the pheasant and\r\nthe partridge.\r\n\r\nThe courts of the forest were three in number, viz. the court of\r\nattachments, swainmote and justice-seat. The court of attachments\r\n(called also the wood-mote) is held every forty days for the foresters\r\nto bring in their attachments concerning any hurt done to vert or\r\nvenison (_in viridi et venatione_) in the forest, and for the verderers\r\nto receive and mark the same, but no conviction takes place. The\r\nswainmote, held three times in the year, is the court to which all the\r\nfreeholders within the forest owe suit and service, and of which the\r\nverderers are the judges. In this court all offences against the forest\r\nlaws may be tried, but no judgment or punishment follows. This is\r\nreserved for the justice-seat, held every third year, to which the rolls\r\nof offences presented at the court of attachment, and tried at the\r\nswainmote, are presented by verderers. The justice-seat is the court of\r\nthe chief justice in eyre, who, says Coke, \"is commonly a man of greater\r\ndignity than knowledge of the laws of the forests; and therefore where\r\njustice-seats are to be held some other persons whom the king shall\r\nappoint are associated with him, who together are to determine _omnia\r\nplacita forestae_.\" There were two chief justices for the forests\r\n_intra_ and _ultra Trentam_ respectively. The necessary officers of a\r\nforest are a steward, verderers, foresters, regarders, agisters and\r\nwoodwards. The verderer was a judicial officer chosen in full county by\r\nthe freeholders in the same manner as the coroner. His office was to\r\nview and receive the attachments of the foresters, and to mark them on\r\nhis rolls. A forester was \"an officer sworn to preserve the vert and\r\nvenison in the forest, and to attend upon the wild beasts within his\r\nbailiwick.\" The regarders were of the nature of visitors: their duty was\r\nto make a regard (_visitatio nemorum_) every third year, to inquire of\r\nall offences, and of the concealment of such offences by any officer of\r\nthe forest. The business of the agister was to look after the pasturage\r\nof the forest, and to receive the payments for the same by persons\r\nentitled to pasture their cattle in the forests. Both the pasturage and\r\nthe payment were called \"agistment.\" The woodward was the officer who\r\nhad the care of the woods and vert and presented offences at the court\r\nof attachment.\r\n\r\nThe legal conception of a forest was thus that of a definite territory\r\nwithin which the code of the forest law prevailed to the exclusion of\r\nthe common law. The ownership of the soil might be in any one, but the\r\nrights of the proprietor were limited by the laws made for the\r\nprotection of the king's wild beasts. These laws, enforced by fines\r\noften arbitrary and excessive, were a great grievance to the unfortunate\r\nowners of land within or in the neighbourhood of the forest. The\r\noffence of \"purpresture\" may be cited as an example. This was an\r\nencroachment on the forest rights, by building a house within the\r\nforest, and it made no difference whether the land belonged to the\r\nbuilder or not. In either case it was an offence punishable by fines at\r\ndiscretion. And if a man converted woodlands within the forest into\r\narable land, he was guilty of the offence known as \"assarting,\" whether\r\nthe covert belonged to himself or not.\r\n\r\nThe hardships of the forest laws under the Norman kings, and their\r\nextension to private estates by the process of afforestment, were among\r\nthe grievances which united the barons and people against the king in\r\nthe reign of John. The Great Charter of King John contains clauses\r\nrelating to the forest laws, but no separate charter of the forest. The\r\nfirst charter of the forest is that of Henry III., issued in 1217. \"As\r\nan important piece of legislation,\" said Stubbs,[3] \"it must be compared\r\nwith the forest assize of 1184, and with 44th, 47th and 48th clauses of\r\nthe charter of John. It is observable that most of the abuses which are\r\nremedied by it are regarded as having sprung up since the accession of\r\nHenry II.; but the most offensive afforestations have been made under\r\nRichard and John. These latter are at once disafforested; but those of\r\nHenry II. only so far as they had been carried out to the injury of the\r\nlandowners and outside of the royal demesne.\" Land which had thus been\r\nonce forest land and was afterwards disafforested was known as\r\n_purlieu_--derived by Manwood from the French _pur_ and _lieu_, i.e. \"a\r\nplace exempt from the forest.\" The forest laws still applied in a\r\nmodified manner to the purlieu. The benefit of the disafforestment\r\nexisted only for the owner of the lands; as to all other persons the\r\nland was forest still, and the king's wild beasts were to \"have free\r\nrecourse therein and safe return to the forest, without any hurt or\r\ndestruction other than by the owners of the lands in the purlieu where\r\nthey shall be found, and that only to hunt and chase them back again\r\ntowards the forest without any forestalling\" (Manwood, _On the Forest\r\nLaws_--article \"Purlieu\").\r\n\r\nThe revival of the forest laws was one of the means resorted to by\r\nCharles I. for raising a revenue independently of parliament, and the\r\nroyal forests in Essex were so enlarged that they were hyperbolically\r\nsaid to include the whole county. The 4th earl of Southampton was nearly\r\nruined by a decision that stripped him of his estate near the New\r\nForest. The boundaries of Rockingham Forest were increased from 6 m. to\r\n60, and enormous fines imposed on the trespassers,--Lord Salisbury being\r\nassessed in L20,000, Lord Westmoreland in L19,000, Sir Christopher\r\nHatton in L12,000 (Hallam's _Constitutional History of England_, c.\r\nviii.). By the statute 16 Charles I. c. 16 (1640) the royal forests were\r\ndetermined for ever according to their boundaries in the twentieth year\r\nof James, all subsequent enlargements being annulled.\r\n\r\nThe forest laws, since the Revolution, have fallen into complete disuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Coke, 4 _Inst._, 300.\r\n\r\n  [2] Manwood's _Treatise of the Forest Laws_ (4th edition, 1717).\r\n\r\n  [3] _Documents Illustrative of English History_, p. 338.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTS AND FORESTRY. Although most people know what a forest (Lat.\r\n_foris_, \"out of doors\") is, a definition of it which suits all cases is\r\nby no means easy to give. Manwood, in his treatise of the _Lawes of the\r\nForest_ (1598), defines a forest as \"a certain territory of woody\r\ngrounds, fruitful pastures, privileged for wild beasts and fowls of\r\nforest, chase and warren, to rest and abide in, in the safe protection\r\nof the king, for his princely delight and pleasure.\" This primitive\r\ndefinition has, in modern times, when the economic aspect of forests\r\ncame more into the foreground, given place to others, so that forest\r\nmay, in a general way, now be described as \"an area which is for the\r\nmost part set aside for the production of timber and other forest\r\nproduce, or which is expected to exercise certain climatic effects, or\r\nto protect the locality against injurious influences.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as conclusions can now be drawn, it is probable that the greater\r\npart of the dry land of the earth was, at some time, covered with\r\nforest, which consisted of a variety of trees and shrubs grouped\r\naccording to climate, soil and configuration of the several localities.\r\nWhen the old trees reached their limit of life, they disappeared, and\r\nyounger trees took their place. The conditions for an uninterrupted\r\nregeneration of the forest were favourable, and the result was vigorous\r\nproduction by the creative powers of soil and climate. Then came man,\r\nand by degrees interfered, until in most countries of the earth the area\r\nunder forest has been considerably reduced. The first decided\r\ninterference was probably due to the establishment of domestic animals;\r\nmen burnt the forest to obtain pasture for their flocks. Subsequently\r\nsimilar measures on an ever-increasing scale were employed to prepare\r\nthe land for agricultural purposes. More recently enormous areas of\r\nforests were destroyed by reckless cutting and subsequent firing in the\r\nextraction of timber for economic purposes.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be understood that the distribution and character of the\r\nnow remaining forests must differ enormously (see PLANTS:\r\n_Distribution_). Large portions of the earth are still covered with\r\ndense masses of tall trees, while others contain low scrub or grass\r\nland, or are desert. As a general rule, natural forests consist of a\r\nnumber of different species intermixed; but in some cases certain\r\nspecies, called gregarious, have succeeded in obtaining the upper hand,\r\nthus forming more or less pure forests of one species only. The number\r\nof species differs very much. In many tropical forests hundreds of\r\nspecies may be found on a comparatively small area, in other cases the\r\nnumber is limited. Burma has several thousand species of trees and\r\nshrubs, Sind has only ten species of trees. Central Europe has about\r\nforty species, and the greater part of northern Russia, Sweden and\r\nNorway contains forests consisting of about half a dozen species.\r\nElevation above the sea acts similarly to rising latitude, but the\r\neffect is much more rapidly produced. Generally speaking, it may be said\r\nthat the Tropics and adjoining parts of the earth, wherever the climate\r\nis not modified by considerable elevation, contain broad-leaved species,\r\npalms, bamboos, &c. Here most of the best and hardest timbers are found,\r\nsuch as teak, mahogany and ebony. The northern countries are rich in\r\nconifers. Taking a section from Central Africa to North Europe, it will\r\nbe found that south and north of the equator there is a large belt of\r\ndense hardwood forest; then comes the Sahara, then the coast of the\r\nMediterranean with forests of cork oak; then Italy with oak, olive,\r\nchestnut, gradually giving place to ash, sycamore, beech, birch and\r\ncertain species of pine; in Switzerland and Germany silver fir and\r\nspruce gain ground. Silver fir disappears in central Germany, and the\r\ncountries around the Baltic contain forests consisting chiefly of Scotch\r\npine, spruce and birch, to which, in Siberia, larch must be added, while\r\nthe lower parts of the ground are stocked with hornbeam, willow, alder\r\nand poplar. In North America the distribution is as follows: Tropical\r\nvegetation is found in south Florida, while in north Florida it changes\r\ninto a subtropical vegetation consisting of evergreen broad-leaved\r\nspecies with pines on sandy soils. On going north in the Atlantic\r\nregion, the forest becomes temperate, containing deciduous broad-leaved\r\ntrees and pines, until Canada is reached, where larches, spruces and\r\nfirs occupy the ground. Around the great lakes on sandy soils the\r\nbroad-leaved forest gives way to pines. On proceeding west from the\r\nAtlantic region the forest changes into a shrubby vegetation, and this\r\ninto the prairies. Farther west, towards the Pacific coast, extensive\r\nforests are found consisting, according to latitude and elevation above\r\nthe sea, of pines, larches, fir, Thujas and Tsugas. In Japan a tropical\r\nvegetation is found in the south, comprising palms, figs, ebony,\r\nmangrove and others. This is followed on proceeding north by subtropical\r\nforests containing evergreen oaks, _Podocarpus_, tree-ferns, and, at\r\nhigher elevations, _Cryptomeria_ and _Chamaecyparis_. Then follow\r\ndeciduous broad-leaved forests, and finally firs, spruces and larches.\r\nIn India the character of the forests is governed chiefly by rainfall\r\nand elevation. Where the former is heavy evergreen forests of\r\nGuttiferae, Dipterocarpeae, Leguminosae, Euphorbias, figs, palms, ferns,\r\nbamboos and india-rubber trees are found. Under a less copious rainfall\r\ndeciduous forests appear, containing teak and sal (_Shorea robusta_) and\r\na great variety of other valuable trees. Under a still smaller rainfall\r\nthe vegetation becomes sparse, containing acacias, _Dalbergia sissoo_\r\nand Tamarix. Where the rainfall is very light or _nil_, desert appears.\r\nIn the Himalayas, subtropical to arctic conditions are found, the\r\nforests containing, according to elevation, pines, firs, deodars, oaks,\r\nchestnuts, magnolias, laurels, rhododendrons and bamboos. Australia,\r\nagain, has its own particular flora of eucalypts, of which some two\r\nhundred species have been distinguished, as well as wattles. Some of the\r\neucalypts attain an enormous height.\r\n\r\n_Utility of Forests._--In the economy of man and of nature forests are\r\nof direct and indirect value, the former chiefly through the produce\r\nwhich they yield, and the latter through the influence which they\r\nexercise upon climate, the regulation of moisture, the stability of the\r\nsoil, the healthiness and beauty of a country and allied subjects. The\r\n_indirect_ utility will be dealt with first. A piece of land bare of\r\nvegetation is, throughout the year, exposed to the full effect of sun\r\nand air currents, and the climatic conditions which are produced by\r\nthese agencies. If, on the other hand, a piece of land is covered with a\r\ngrowth of plants, and especially with a dense crop of forest vegetation,\r\nit enjoys the benefit of certain agencies which modify the effect of sun\r\nand wind on the soil and the adjoining layers of air. These modifying\r\nagencies are as follows: (1) The crowns of the trees intercept the rays\r\nof the sun and the falling rain; they obstruct the movement of air\r\ncurrents, and reduce radiation at night. (2) The leaves, flowers and\r\nfruits, augmented by certain plants which grow in the shade of the\r\ntrees, form a layer of mould, or humus, which protects the soil against\r\nrapid changes of temperature, and greatly influences the movement of\r\nwater in it. (3) The roots of the trees penetrate into the soil in all\r\ndirections, and bind it together. The effects of these agencies have\r\nbeen observed from ancient times, and widely differing views have been\r\ntaken of them. Of late years, however, more careful observations have\r\nbeen made at so-called parallel stations, that is to say, one station in\r\nthe middle of a forest, and another outside at some distance from its\r\nedge, but otherwise exposed to the same general conditions. In this way,\r\nthe following results have been obtained: (1) Forests reduce the\r\ntemperature of the air and soil to a moderate extent, and render the\r\nclimate more equable. (2) They increase the relative humidity of the\r\nair, and reduce evaporation. (3) They tend to increase the precipitation\r\nof moisture. As regards the actual rainfall, their effect in low lands\r\nis _nil_ or very small; in hilly countries it is probably greater, but\r\ndefinite results have not yet been obtained owing to the difficulty of\r\nseparating the effect of forests from that of other factors. (4) They\r\nhelp to regulate the water supply, produce a more sustained feeding of\r\nsprings, tend to reduce violent floods, and render the flow of water in\r\nrivers more continuous. (5) They assist in preventing denudation,\r\nerosion, landslips, avalanches, the silting up of rivers and low lands\r\nand the formation of sand dunes. (6) They reduce the velocity of\r\nair-currents, protect adjoining fields against cold or dry winds, and\r\nafford shelter to cattle, game and useful birds. (7) They may, under\r\ncertain conditions, improve the healthiness of a country, and help in\r\nits defence. (8) They increase the beauty of a country, and produce a\r\nhealthy aesthetic influence upon the people.\r\n\r\nThe _direct_ utility of forests is chiefly due to their produce, the\r\ncapital which they represent, and the work which they provide. The\r\nprincipal produce of forests consists of timber and firewood. Both are\r\nnecessaries for the daily life of the people. Apart from a limited\r\nnumber of broad-leaved species, the conifers have become the most\r\nimportant timber trees in the economy of man. They are found in greatest\r\nquantities in the countries around the Baltic and in North America. In\r\nmodern times iron and other materials have, to a considerable extent,\r\nreplaced timber, while coal, lignite, and peat compete with firewood;\r\nnevertheless wood is still indispensable, and likely to remain so. This\r\nis borne out by the statistics of the most civilized nations. Whereas\r\nthe population of Great Britain and Ireland, during the period\r\n1880-1900, increased by about 20%, the imports of timber, during the\r\nsame period, increased by 45%; in other words, every head of population\r\nin 1900 used more timber than twenty years earlier. Germany produced in\r\n1880 about as much timber as she required; in 1899 she imported\r\n4,600,000 tons, valued at L14,000,000, and her imports are rapidly\r\nincreasing, although the yield capacity of her own forests is much\r\nhigher now than it was formerly. Wood is now used for many purposes\r\nwhich formerly were not thought of. The manufacture of the wood pulp\r\nannually imported into Britain consumes at least 2,000,000 tons of\r\ntimber. A fabric closely resembling silk is now made of spruce wood. The\r\nvariety of other, or minor, produce yielded by forests is very great,\r\nand much of it is essential for the well-being of the people and for\r\nvarious industries. The yield of fodder is of the utmost importance in\r\ncountries subject to periodic droughts; in many places field crops could\r\nnot be grown successfully without the leaf-mould and brushwood taken\r\nfrom the forests. As regards industries, attention need only be drawn to\r\nsuch articles as commercial fibre, tanning materials, dye-stuffs, lac,\r\nturpentine, resin, rubber, gutta-percha, &c. Great Britain and Ireland\r\nalone import every year such materials to the value of L12,000,000, half\r\nof this being represented by rubber.\r\n\r\nThe _capital_ employed in forests consists chiefly of the value of the\r\nsoil and growing stock of timber. The latter is, ordinarily, of much\r\ngreater value than the former wherever a sustained annual yield of\r\ntimber is expected from a forest. In the case of a Scotch pine forest,\r\nfor instance, the value of the growing stock is, under the\r\nabove-mentioned condition, from three to five times that of the soil.\r\nThe rate of interest yielded by capital invested in forests differs, of\r\ncourse, considerably according to circumstances, but on the whole it\r\nmay, under proper management, be placed equal to that yielded by\r\nagricultural land; it is lower than the agricultural rate on the better\r\nclasses of land, but higher on the inferior classes. Hence the latter\r\nare specially indicated for the forest industry, and the former for the\r\nproduction of agricultural crops. Forests require _labour_ in a great\r\nvariety of ways, such as (1) general administration, formation, tending\r\nand harvesting; (2) transport of produce; and (3) industries which\r\ndepend on forests for their prime material. The labour indicated under\r\nthe first head differs considerably according to circumstances, but its\r\namount is smaller than that required if the land is used for\r\nagriculture. Hence forests provide additional labour only if they are\r\nestablished on surplus lands. Owing to the bulky nature of forest\r\nproduce its transport forms a business of considerable magnitude, the\r\namount of labour being perhaps equal to half that employed under the\r\nfirst head. The greatest amount of labour is, however, required in the\r\nworking up of the raw material yielded by forests. In this respect\r\nattention may be drawn to the chair industry in and around High Wycombe\r\nin Buckinghamshire, where more than 20,000 workmen are employed in\r\nconverting the beech, grown on the adjoining chalk hills, into chairs\r\nand tools of many patterns. Complete statistics for Great Britain are\r\nnot available under this head, but it may be mentioned that in Germany\r\nthe people employed in the forests amount to 2.3% of the total\r\npopulation; those employed on transport of forest produce 1.1%;\r\nlabourers employed on the various wood industries, 8.6%; or a total of\r\n12%. An important feature of the work connected with forests and their\r\nproduce is that a great part of it can be made to fit in with the\r\nrequirements of agriculture; that is to say, it can be done at seasons\r\nwhen field crops do not require attention. Thus the rural labourers or\r\nsmall farmers can earn some money at times when they have nothing else\r\nto do, and when they would probably sit idle if no forest work were\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\nWhether, or how far, the utility of forests is brought out in a\r\nparticular country depends on its special conditions, such as (1) the\r\nposition of a country, its communications, and the control which it\r\nexercises over other countries, such as colonies; (2) the quantity and\r\nquality of substitutes for forest produce available in the country; (3)\r\nthe value of land and labour, and the returns which land yields if used\r\nfor other purposes; (4) the density of population; (5) the amount of\r\ncapital available for investment; (6) the climate and configuration,\r\nespecially the geographical position, whether inland or on the border\r\nof the sea, &c. No general rule can be laid down, showing whether\r\nforests are required in a country, or, if so, to what extent; that\r\nquestion must be answered according to the special circumstances of each\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table shows the forests of various European states:--\r\n\r\n  +------------------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n  |                  |             | Percentage | Percentage |   Forest   |\r\n  |                  |   Area of   |  of Total  | of Forest  |  Area per  |\r\n  |    Countries.    | Forests, in |   Area of  |   Area     |  Head of   |\r\n  |                  |    Acres.   |   Country  | belonging  | Population,|\r\n  |                  |             |    under   |  to the    |  in Acres. |\r\n  |                  |             |   Forest.  |   State.   |            |\r\n  +------------------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n  | Sweden           |  49,000,000 |     48     |     33     |    9.5     |\r\n  | Norway           |  17,000,000 |     21     |     28     |    7.6     |\r\n  | Russia, including|             |            |            |            |\r\n  |   Finland        | 518,000,000 |     40     |     61     |    5.9     |\r\n  | Bosnia and       |             |            |            |            |\r\n  |   Herzegovina    |   6,400,000 |     50     |     78     |    4.0     |\r\n  | Bulgaria         |   7,600,000 |     30     |     30     |    2.3     |\r\n  | Turkey           |  11,200,000 |     20     |     . .    |    1.7     |\r\n  | Servia           |   3,900,000 |     32     |     37     |    1.5     |\r\n  | Rumania          |   6,400,000 |     18     |     40     |    1.3     |\r\n  | Spain            |  21,200,000 |     17     |     84     |    1.2     |\r\n  | Hungary          |  22,500,000 |     28     |     15     |    1.2     |\r\n  | Austria          |  24,000,000 |     32     |      7     |     .9     |\r\n  | Greece           |   2,000,000 |     13     |     80     |     .85    |\r\n  | Luxemburg        |     200,000 |     30     |     . .    |     .82    |\r\n  | Switzerland      |   2,100,000 |     20     |      5     |     .7     |\r\n  | Germany          |  35,000,000 |     26     |     34     |     .6     |\r\n  | France           |  24,000,000 |     18     |     12     |     .6     |\r\n  | Italy            |  10,400,000 |     15     |      4     |     .3     |\r\n  | Denmark          |     600,000 |      6     |     24     |     .25    |\r\n  | Belgium          |   1,300,000 |     18     |      5     |     .2     |\r\n  | Portugal         |     770,000 |      3.5   |      8     |     .15    |\r\n  | Holland          |     560,000 |      7     |      ?     |     .1     |\r\n  | Great Britain    |   3,000,000 |      4     |      3     |     .07    |\r\n  +------------------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThese data exhibit considerable differences, since the percentage of the\r\nforest area varies from 3.5 to 50, and the area per head of population\r\nfrom .07 to 9.5 acres. Russia, Sweden and Norway may as yet have more\r\nforest than they require for their own population. On the other hand,\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Holland, and even\r\nBelgium, France and Italy have not a sufficient forest area to meet\r\ntheir own requirements; at the same time, they are all sea-bound\r\ncountries, and importation is easy, while most of them are under the\r\ninfluence of moist sea winds, which reduces to a subordinate position\r\nthe importance of forests for climatic reasons.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with the area of forests in a country is the state\r\nof ownership--whether they belong to the state, corporations or to\r\nprivate persons. Where, apart from the financial aspect and the supply\r\nof work, forests are not required for the sake of their indirect\r\neffects, and where importation from other countries is easy and assured,\r\nthe government of the country need not, as a rule, trouble itself to\r\nmaintain or acquire forests. Where the reverse conditions exist, and\r\nespecially where the cost of transport over long distances becomes\r\nprohibitive, a wise administration will take measures to assure the\r\nmaintenance of a suitable proportion of the country under forest. This\r\ncan be done either by maintaining or constituting a suitable area of\r\nstate forests, or by exercising a certain amount of control over\r\ncorporation and even private forests. Such measures are more called for\r\nin continental countries than in those which are sea-bound, as is proved\r\nby the above statistics.\r\n\r\n_Supply of Timber--Imports and Exports._--The following table shows the\r\nnet imports and exports of European countries (average data, calculated\r\nfrom the returns of recent years).\r\n\r\nThe only timber-exporting countries of Europe are Russia, Sweden,\r\nNorway, Austria-Hungary and Rumania; all the others either have only\r\nenough for their own consumption, or import timber. Great Britain and\r\nIreland import now upwards of 10,000,000 tons a year, Germany about\r\n4,600,000 tons, and Belgium about 1,300,000 tons. Holland, France,\r\nPortugal, Spain and Italy are all importing countries, as also are Asia\r\nMinor, Egypt and Algeria. The west coast of Africa exports hardwoods,\r\nand imports coniferous timber. The Cape and Natal import considerable\r\nquantities of pine and fir wood. Australasia exports hardwoods and some\r\nKauri pine from New Zealand, but imports larger quantities of light pine\r\nand fir timber. British India and Siam export teak and small quantities\r\nof fancy woods. The West Indies and South America export hardwoods, and\r\nimport pine and fir wood. The United States of America will not much\r\nlonger be a genuine exporting country, since they import already almost\r\nas much timber from Canada as they export. Canada exports considerable\r\nquantities of timber. The Dominion has still a forest area of 1,250,000\r\nsq. m., equal to 38% of the total area, and giving 165 acres of forest\r\nfor every inhabitant. Although only about one-third of the forest area\r\ncan be called regular timber land, Canada possesses an enormous forest\r\nwealth, with which she might supply permanently nearly all other\r\ncountries deficient in material, if the governing bodies in the several\r\nprovinces would only determine to stop the present fearful waste caused\r\nby axe and fire, and to introduce a regular system of management. As\r\nmatters stand, the supplies of the most valuable timber of Canada, the\r\nwhite or Weymouth pine (_Pinus strobus_), are nearly exhausted, the\r\ngreat stores of spruce in the eastern provinces are being rapidly\r\ndestroyed, and the forests of Douglas fir in the western provinces have\r\nbeen attacked for export to the United States and to other countries.\r\n\r\n  _Net Imports and Exports of European Countries._\r\n\r\n  +------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |                  |  Quantities in Tons.  |  Value in L Sterling. |\r\n  |    Countries.    +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |                  |  Imports. |  Exports. |  Imports. |  Exports. |\r\n  +------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  | United Kingdom   |10,004,000 |    . .    |26,540,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Germany          | 4,600,000 |    . .    |14,820,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Belgium          | 1,300,000 |    . .    | 5,040,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | France           | 1,230,000 |    . .    | 3,950,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Italy            |   620,000 |    . .    | 2,100,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Spain            |   470,000 |    . .    | 1,500,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Denmark          |   470,000 |    . .    | 1,250,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Switzerland      |   204,000 |    . .    |   480,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Holland          |   180,000 |    . .    |   720,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Servia           |   110,000 |    . .    |   160,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Portugal         |    60,000 |    . .    |   200,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Greece           |    35,000 |    . .    |   130,000 |    . .    |\r\n  | Rumania          |    . .    |   400,000 |    . .    |   840,000 |\r\n  | Norway           |    . .    | 1,300,000 |    . .    | 2,200,000 |\r\n  | Austria-Hungary  |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |   with Bosnia and|           |           |           |           |\r\n  |   Herzegovina    |    . .    | 3,996,000 |    . .    |11,400,000 |\r\n  | Sweden           |    . .    | 4,460,000 |    . .    | 7,930,000 |\r\n  | Russia with      |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |   Finland        |    . .    | 6,890,000 |    . .    |10,440,000 |\r\n  |                  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |      Total       |19,283,000 |17,046,000 |56,890,000 |32,810,000 |\r\n  +------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  | Net Imports      | 2,237,000 |           |           |24,080,000 |\r\n  +------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  These net imports are received from non-European countries. They\r\n  consist chiefly of valuable hardwoods, like teak, mahogany, eucalypts\r\n  and others.\r\n\r\nTaking the remaining stocks of the whole earth together, it may be said\r\nthat a sufficient quantity of hardwoods is available, but the only\r\ncountries which are able to supply coniferous timber for export on a\r\nconsiderable scale are Russia, Sweden, Norway, Austria and Canada. As\r\nthese countries have practically to supply the rest of the world, and as\r\nthe management of their forests is far from satisfactory, the question\r\nof supplying light pine and fir timber, which forms the very staff of\r\nlife of the wood industries, must become a very serious matter before\r\nmany years have passed. Unmistakable signs of the coming crisis are\r\neverywhere visible to all who wish to see, and it is difficult to\r\nover-state the gravity of the problem, when it is remembered, for\r\ninstance, that 87% of all the timber imported into Great Britain\r\nconsists of light pine and fir, and that most of the other importing\r\ncountries are similarly situated. In some of these countries little or\r\nno room exists for the extension of woodland, but this statement does\r\nnot apply to Great Britain and Ireland, which contain upwards of\r\n12,000,000 acres of waste land, and 12,500,000 acres of mountain and\r\nheath land used for light grazing. One-fourth of that area, if put under\r\nforest, would produce all the timber now imported which can be grown in\r\nBritain, that is to say, about 95% of the total.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table shows the movements of timber within the greater\r\npart of the British empire:--\r\n\r\n  _Net Imports and Exports into and from the British Empire._\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |                       |    Annual Average   |   Annual Average    |\r\n  |      Countries.       |  during the Years   |  during the Years   |\r\n  |                       |      1884-1888.     |      1900-1903.     |\r\n  +-----------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |                       |   Net    |   Net    |   Net    |   Net    |\r\n  |                       | Imports. | Exports. | Imports. | Exports. |\r\n  +-----------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |                       |     L    |     L    |     L    |    L     |\r\n  |United Kingdom         |15,000,000|   . .    |26,540,000|   . .    |\r\n  |Australasia            | 1,284,000|   . .    |   568,000|   . .    |\r\n  |Africa                 |  72,000  |   . .    |   737,000|   . .    |\r\n  |West Indies,           |          |          |          |          |\r\n  |  Honduras and Guiana  |    . .   |   207,000|   . .    |    71,000|\r\n  |India, Ceylon and      |          |          |          |          |\r\n  |  Mauritius            |    . .   |   528,000|   . .    |   580,000|\r\n  |Dominion of Canada     |    . .   | 4,025,000|   . .    | 4,789,000|\r\n  |                       +----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |    Total              |16,356,000| 4,760,000|27,845,000| 5,440,000|\r\n  +-----------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |Net Imports            |11,596,000|   . .    |22,405,000|   . .    |\r\n  |Total increase in      |          |          |          |          |\r\n  |  16 years             |    . .   |   . .    |10,809,000|   . .    |\r\n  |Average annual increase|          |          |          |          |\r\n  |  of net imports       |    . .   |   . .    |   675,562|   . .    |\r\n  +-----------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n_Forest Management._--In early times there was practically no forest\r\nmanagement. As long as the forests occupied considerable areas, their\r\nproduce was looked upon as the free gift of nature, like air and water;\r\nmen took it, used it, and even destroyed it without let or hindrance.\r\nWith the gradual increase of population and the consequent reduction of\r\nthe forest area, proprietary ideas developed; people claimed the\r\nownership of certain forests, and proceeded to protect them against\r\noutsiders. Subsequently the law of the country was called in to help in\r\nprotection, leading to the promulgation of special forest laws. By\r\ndegrees it was found that mere protection was not sufficient, and that\r\nsteps must be taken to enforce a more judicious treatment, as well as to\r\nlimit the removal of timber to what the forests were capable of\r\nproducing permanently. The teaching of natural science and of political\r\neconomy was brought to bear upon the subject, so that now forestry has\r\nbecome a special science. This is recognized in many countries, amongst\r\nwhich Germany stands first, closely followed by France, Austria, Denmark\r\nand Belgium. Of non-European countries the palm belongs to British\r\nIndia, and then follow Ceylon, the Malay States, the Cape of Good Hope\r\nand Japan. The United States of America have also turned their attention\r\nto the subject. Most of the British colonies are, in this respect, as\r\nyet in a backward state, and the matter has still to be fought out in\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, though many writers have urged the importance\r\nof the question upon the public and the government. There can be no\r\ndoubt that all civilized countries must, sooner or later, adopt a\r\nrational and systematic treatment of their forests.\r\n\r\nFor details as to the separate countries, see the articles under the\r\ncountry headings; in this article only some of the more important\r\ncountries are dealt with, in so far as the history of their forestry is\r\nimportant. A few notes on Germany and France will be given, because in\r\nthese countries forest management has been brought to highest\r\nperfection; Italy is mentioned, because she has allowed her forests to\r\nbe destroyed; and a short description of forestry in the United Kingdom\r\nand in India follows. A separate section is devoted to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n_Germany_ is in general well-wooded. The winters being long and severe,\r\nan abundant supply of fuel is almost as essential as a sufficient supply\r\nof food. This necessity has led, along with a passion for the chase, to\r\nthe preservation of forests, and to the establishment of an admirable\r\nsystem of forest cultivation, almost as carefully conducted as field\r\ntillage. The Black Forest stretches the whole length of the grand-duchy\r\nof Baden and part of the kingdom of Wurttemberg, from the Neckar to\r\nBasel and the Lake of Constance. The vegetation resembles that of the\r\nVosges; forests of spruce, silver fir, Scotch pine, and, mingled with\r\nbirches, beech and oak, are the chief woods met with. Until\r\ncomparatively recent times large quantities of timber derived from these\r\nforests were floated down the Rhine to Holland and also shipped to\r\nEngland. Now the greater part of it is used locally for construction, or\r\nit is converted into paper pulp. In the grand-duchy of Hesse the\r\nOdenwald range of mountains, stretching between the Main and the Neckar,\r\ncontains the chief supply of timber. In the province of Nassau there are\r\nthe large wooded tracts of the Taunus mountain range and the Westerwald.\r\n\r\nIn Rhenish Prussia valuable forests lie partly in the Eifel, on the\r\nborders of Belgium, and on the mountains overhanging the Upper Moselle,\r\nbut they do not furnish such stately trees as the Black Forest and the\r\nOdenwald. The Spessart, near Aschaffenburg in Bavaria, is one of the\r\nmost extensive forests of middle Germany, containing large masses of\r\nfine oak and beech, with plantations of coniferous trees, such as\r\nspruce, Scotch pine and silver fir. Bavaria possesses other fine forest\r\ntracts, such as the Baierischewald on the Bohemian frontier, the\r\nKranzberg near Munich, and the Frankenwald in the north of the kingdom.\r\nNorth Germany has extensive forests on the Harz and Thuringian\r\nMountains, while in East Prussia large tracts of flat ground are covered\r\nwith Scotch pine, spruce, oak and beech.\r\n\r\nEvery German state has its forest organization. In Prussia the\r\ndepartment is presided over by the Oberland Forstmeister at Berlin,\r\nwhile each province, or part of a province, has an Oberforstmeister,\r\nunder whom a number of Oberforsters administrate the state and communal\r\nforests. These, again, are assisted by a lower class of officials called\r\nForsters. The Oberforsters throughout Germany are educated at special\r\nschools of forestry, of which in 1909 the following nine existed:\r\n\r\nIn Prussia: at Eberswalde and Munden.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria: at Munich and Aschaffenburg.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony: at Tharand.\r\n\r\nIn Wurttemberg: at Tubingen.\r\n\r\nIn Baden: at Carlsruhe.\r\n\r\nIn Hesse: at Giessen.\r\n\r\nIn the grand-duchy of Saxony: at Eisenach.\r\n\r\nThe schools at Munich, Tubingen and Giessen form part of the\r\nuniversities at these places; that at Carlsruhe is attached to the\r\ntechnical high school; the others are academies for the study of\r\nforestry only, but there is a tendency to transfer them all to the\r\nuniversities. The subordinate staff are trained for their work in\r\nso-called silvicultural schools, of which a large number exist. In this\r\nway the German forests have been brought to a high degree of\r\nproductiveness, but the material derived from them falls far short of\r\nthe requirements, although the forests occupy 26% of the total area of\r\nthe country; hence the net imports of timber amount already to 4,600,000\r\ntons a year, and they are steadily rising.\r\n\r\n_France._--The principal timber tree of France is the oak. The cork oak\r\nis grown extensively in the south and in Corsica. The beech, ash, elm,\r\nmaple, birch, walnut, chestnut and poplar are all important trees, while\r\nthe silver fir and spruce form magnificent forests in the Vosges and\r\nJura Mountains, and the Aleppo and maritime pines are cultivated in the\r\nsouth and south-west. About one-seventh of the entire territory is still\r\ncovered with wood.\r\n\r\nForest legislation took its rise in France about the middle of the 16th\r\ncentury, and the great minister Sully urged the enforcement of\r\nrestrictive forest laws. In 1669 a fixed treatment of state forests was\r\nenacted. Duhamel in 1755 published his famous work on forest trees.\r\nReckless destruction of the forests, however, was in progress, and the\r\nRevolution of 1789 gave a fresh stimulus to the work of devastation. The\r\nusual results have followed in the frequency and destructiveness of\r\nfloods, which have washed away the soil from the hillsides and valleys\r\nof many districts, especially in the south, and the frequent\r\ninundations of the last fifty years are no doubt caused by the\r\ndeforesting of the sources of the Rhone and Saone. Laws were passed in\r\n1860 and 1864, providing for the reforesting, \"_reboisement_,\" of the\r\nslopes of mountains, and these laws take effect on private as well as\r\nstate property. Thousands of acres are annually planted in the\r\ndepartments of Hautes and Basses Alpes; and during the summer of 1875,\r\nwhen much injury was done by floods in the south of France, the Durance,\r\nformerly the most dangerous in this respect of French rivers, gave\r\nlittle cause for anxiety, as it is round the head waters of this river\r\nthat the chief plantations have been formed. While tracts formerly\r\ncovered with wood have been replanted, plantations have been formed on\r\nthe shifting sands or dunes along the coast of Gascony. A forest of\r\n_Pinus pinaster_, 150 m. in length, now stretches from Bayonne to the\r\nmouth of the Gironde, raised by means of sowing steadily continued since\r\n1789; the cultivation of the pine, along with draining, has transformed\r\nlow marshy grounds into productive soil extending over an area of about\r\ntwo million acres. The forests thus created provide annually some\r\n600,000 tons of pit timber for the Welsh coal mines.\r\n\r\nThe state forest department is administered by the director-general, who\r\nhas his headquarters at Paris, assisted by a board of administration,\r\ncharged with the working of the forests, questions of rights and law,\r\nfinance and plantation works.\r\n\r\nThe department is supplied with officers from the forest school at\r\nNancy. This institution was founded in 1824, when M. Lorentz, who had\r\nstudied forestry in Germany, was appointed its first director.\r\n\r\n_Italy._--The kingdom of Italy comprises such different climates that\r\nwithin its limits we find the birch and pines of northern Europe, and\r\nthe olive, fig, manna-ash, and palm of more southern latitudes. By the\r\nrepublic of Venice and the duchy of Genoa forestal legislation was\r\nattempted at various periods from the 15th century downwards. These\r\nefforts were not successful, as the governments were lax in enforcing\r\nthe laws. In 1789 Pius VI. issued regulations prohibiting felling\r\nwithout licence, and later orders were published by his successors in\r\nthe pontifical states. In Lombardy the woods, which in 1830 reached\r\nnearly down to Milan, have almost disappeared. The province of Como\r\ncontains only a remnant of the primitive forests, and the same may also\r\nbe said of the southern slopes of Tirol. At Ravenna there is still a\r\nlarge forest of stone pine, _Pinus pinea_, though it has been much\r\nreduced. The plains of Tuscany are adorned with planted trees, the\r\nolive, mulberry, fig and almond. Sardinia is rich in woods, which cover\r\none-fifth of the area, and contain a large amount of oak, _Quercus\r\nsuber, robur_ and _cerris_. In Sicily the forests have long been felled,\r\nsave the zone at the base of Mount Etna.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of woods has been gradual but persistent; at the end of\r\nthe 17th century the effects of denudation were first felt in the\r\ndestructive force given to mountain torrents by the deforesting of the\r\nApennines. The work of devastation continued until a comparatively\r\nrecent time.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the monastic property of Vallombrosa, Tuscany, 30 m. from\r\nFlorence, was purchased by government for the purposes of a forest\r\nacademy, which was opened in 1869. As only 4% of the total forest area\r\nbelongs to the state, it is doubtful whether much good can now be done.\r\n\r\n_Great Britain and Ireland._--The British Isles were formerly much more\r\nextensively wooded than at present. The rapid increase of population led\r\nto the disforesting of woodland; the climate required the maintenance of\r\nhousehold fires during a great part of the year, and the increasing\r\ndemand for arable land and the extension of manufacturing industries\r\ncombined to cause the diminution of woodland. The proportion of forest\r\nis now very small, and yields but a fraction of the required annual\r\nsupply of timber which is imported with facility from America, northern\r\nEurope and the numerous British colonies.\r\n\r\nOwing to the nature of the climate of the British Islands, with its\r\nabundance of atmospheric moisture and freedom from such extremes of heat\r\nand cold as are prevalent in continental Europe, a great variety of\r\ntrees are successfully cultivated. In England and Ireland oak and beech\r\nare on the whole the most plentiful trees in the low and fertile parts;\r\nin the south of Scotland the beech and ash are perhaps most common,\r\nwhile the Scotch fir and birch are characteristic of the arboreous\r\nvegetation in the Highlands. Although few extensive forests now exist,\r\nwoods of small area, belts of planting, clumps of trees, coppice and\r\nhedgerows, are generally distributed over the country, constituting a\r\nmass of wood of considerable importance, giving a clothed appearance in\r\nmany parts, and affording illustrations of skilled arboriculture not to\r\nbe found in any other country.\r\n\r\nThe principal state forests in England are Windsor Park, 14,000 acres;\r\nthe New Forest, &c., in Hampshire, 76,000 acres; and the Dean Forest in\r\nGloucestershire, 22,500 acres. The total extent of crown forests is\r\nabout 125,000 acres. A large proportion of the crown forests, having\r\nbeen formed with the object of supplying timber for the navy, consists\r\nof oak. The largest forests in Scotland are in Perthshire,\r\nInverness-shire and Aberdeenshire. Of these the most notable are the\r\nearl of Mansfield's near Scone (8000 acres), the duke of Atholl's larch\r\nplantations near Dunkeld (10,000 acres), and in Strathspey a large\r\nextent of Scotch pine, partly native, partly planted, belonging to the\r\nearl of Seafield. In the forests of Mar and Invercauld, the native pine\r\nattains a great size, and there are also large tracts of indigenous\r\nbirch in various districts. Ireland was at one time richly clothed with\r\nwood; this is proved by the abundant remains of fallen trees in the bogs\r\nwhich occupy a large surface of the island. In addition to the causes\r\nabove alluded to as tending to disforest England, the long unsettled\r\nstate of the country also conduced to the diminishing of the woodlands.\r\n\r\nThe forests of Great Britain and Ireland, in spite of the large imports\r\nof timber, have not been appreciably extended up to the present time\r\nbecause (1) the rate at which foreign timber has been laid down in\r\nBritain is very low, thus keeping down the price of home-grown timber;\r\n(2) foreign timber is preferred to home-grown material, because it is in\r\nmany cases of superior quality, while the latter comes into the market\r\nin an irregular and intermittent manner; (3) nearly the whole of the\r\nwaste lands is private property. As regards prices, it can be shown that\r\nthe lowest point was reached about the year 1888, in consequence of the\r\nremarkable development of means of communication, that prices then\r\nremained fairly stationary for some years, and that about 1894 a slow\r\nbut steady rise set in, showing during the years 1894-1904 an increase\r\nof about 20% all round. This was due to the gradual approach of the\r\ncoming crisis in the supply of coniferous timber to the world. It can be\r\nshown that even with present prices the growing of timber can be made to\r\npay, provided it is carried on in a rational and economic manner.\r\nImproved silvicultural methods must be applied, so as to produce a\r\nbetter class of timber, and the forests must be managed according to\r\nwell-arranged working plans, which provide for a regular and sustained\r\nout-turn of timber year by year, so as to develop a healthy and steady\r\nmarket for locally-grown material. Unfortunately the private proprietors\r\nof the waste lands are in many cases not in a financial position to\r\nplant. Starting forests demands a certain outlay in cash, and the\r\nproprietor must forgo the income, however small, hitherto derived from\r\nthe land until the plantations begin to yield a return. In these\r\ncircumstances the state may well be expected to help in one or all of\r\nthe following ways: (1) The equipment of forest schools, where economic\r\nforestry, as elaborated by research, is taught; (2) the management of\r\nthe crown forests on economic principles, so as to serve as patterns to\r\nprivate proprietors; (3) advances should be made to landed proprietors\r\nwho desire to plant land, but are short of funds, just as is done in the\r\ncase of improvements of agricultural holdings; and (4) the state might\r\nacquire surplus lands in certain parts of the country, such as congested\r\ndistricts, and convert them into forests. Action in these directions\r\nwould soon lead to substantial benefits. The income of landed\r\nproprietors would rise, a considerable sum of money now sent abroad\r\nwould remain in the country, and forest industries would spring up, thus\r\nhelping to counteract the ever-increasing flow of people from the\r\ncountry into the large towns, where only too many must join the army of\r\nthe unemployed. Even within a radius of 50 m. of London 700,000 acres of\r\nland are unaccounted for in the official agricultural returns. In\r\nIreland more than 3,000,000 acres are waiting to be utilized, and it is\r\nwell worth the consideration of the Irish Land Commissioners whether the\r\nlands remaining on their hands, when buying and breaking up large\r\nestates, should not be converted into state forests. Such a measure\r\nmight become a useful auxiliary in the peaceful settlement of the Irish\r\nland question. No doubt success depends upon the probable financial\r\nresults. There are at present no British statistics to prove such\r\nsuccess; hence, by way of illustration, it may be stated what the\r\nresults have been in the kingdom of Saxony, which, from an industrial\r\npoint of view, is comparable with England. That country has 432,085\r\nacres of state forests, of which about one-eighth are stocked with\r\nbroad-leaved species, and seven-eighths with conifers. Some of the\r\nforests are situated on low lands, but the bulk of the area is found in\r\nthe hilly parts of the country up to an elevation of 3000 ft. above the\r\nsea. The average price realized of late years per cubic foot of wood\r\namounts to 5d., and yet to such perfection has the management been\r\nbrought by a well-trained staff, that the mean annual net revenue, after\r\nmeeting all expenses, comes to 21s. an acre all round. There can be no\r\ndoubt that, under the more favourable climate of Great Britain, even\r\nbetter results can be obtained, especially if it is remembered that\r\nforeign supplies of coniferous timber must fall off, or, at any rate,\r\nthe price per cubic foot rise considerably.\r\n\r\nThese things have been recognized to some extent, and a movement has\r\nbeen set on foot to improve matters. The Commissioners of Woods and a\r\nnumber of private proprietors had rational working plans prepared for\r\ntheir forests, and instruction in forestry has been developed. There is\r\nnow a well-equipped school of forestry connected with the university of\r\nOxford, while Cambridge is following on similar lines; instruction in\r\nforestry is given at the university of Edinburgh, the Durham College of\r\nScience, at Bangor, Cirencester and other places. The Commissioners of\r\nWoods have purchased an estate of 12,500 acres in Scotland, which will\r\nbe converted into a crown forest, so as to serve as an example. The\r\nexperience thus gained will prove valuable should action ever be taken\r\non the lines suggested by a Royal Commission on Coast Erosion,\r\nReclamation of Tidal Lands and Afforestation, which reported on the last\r\nsubject in 1909.\r\n\r\n_India._--The history of forest administration in India is exceedingly\r\ninstructive to all who take an interest in the welfare of the British\r\nEmpire, because it places before the reader an account of the gradual\r\ndestruction of the greater part of the natural forests, a process\r\nthrough which most other British colonies are now passing, and then it\r\nshows how India emerged triumphantly from the self-inflicted calamity.\r\nAs far as information goes, India was, in the early times, for the most\r\npart covered with forest. Subsequently settlers opened out the country\r\nalong fertile valleys and streams, while nomadic tribes, moving from\r\npasture to pasture, fired alike hills and plains. This process went on\r\nfor centuries. With the advent of British rule forest destruction became\r\nmore rapid than ever, owing to the increase of population, extension of\r\ncultivation, the multiplication of herds of cattle, and the universal\r\nfiring of the forests to produce fresh crops of grass. Then railways\r\ncame, and with their extension the forests suffered anew, partly on\r\naccount of the increased demand for timber and firewood, and partly on\r\naccount of the fresh impetus given to cultivation along their routes.\r\nUltimately, when failure to meet the requirements of public works was\r\nbrought to notice, it was recognized that a grievous mistake had been\r\nmade in allowing the forests to be recklessly destroyed. Already in the\r\nearly part of the 19th century sporadic efforts were made to protect the\r\nforests in various parts of the country, and these continued\r\nintermittently; but the first organized steps were taken about the year\r\n1855, when Lord Dalhousie was governor-general. At that time\r\nconservators of forests existed in Bombay, Madras and Burma. Soon\r\nafterwards other appointments followed, and in 1864 an organized state\r\ndepartment, presided over by the inspector-general of forests, was\r\nestablished. Since then the Indian Forest Department has steadily grown,\r\nso that it has now become of considerable importance for the welfare of\r\nthe people, as well as for the Indian exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe first duty of the department was to ascertain the position and\r\nextent of the remaining forests, and more particularly of that portion\r\nwhich still belonged to the state. Then a special forest law was passed,\r\nwhich was superseded in 1878 by an improved act, providing for the legal\r\nformation of permanent state forests; the determination, regulation,\r\nand, if necessary, commutation of forest rights; the protection of the\r\nforests against unlawful acts and the punishment of forest offences; the\r\nprotection of forest produce in transit; the constitution of a staff of\r\nforest officers, provision to invest them with suitable legal powers,\r\nand the determination of their duties and liabilities. The officers who\r\nadministered the department in its infancy were mostly botanists and\r\nmilitary officers. Some of these became excellent foresters. In order to\r\nprovide a technically trained staff arrangements were made in 1866 by\r\nSir Dietrich Brandis, the first inspector-general of forests, for the\r\ntraining of young Englishmen at the French Forest School at Nancy and at\r\nsimilar institutions in Germany. In 1876 the students were concentrated\r\nat Nancy, and in 1885 an English forest school for India was organized\r\nin connexion with the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill.\r\nIn 1905 the school was transferred to the university of Oxford. The\r\nimperial forest staff of India consisted in 1909 of--officers not\r\nspecially trained before entering the department, 17; officers trained\r\nin France and Germany, 23; officers trained at Cooper's Hill, 143--total\r\n184.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 a forest school was started at Dehra Dun, United Provinces, for\r\nthe training of natives of India as executive officers on the provincial\r\nstaff. Since then a similar school, though on a smaller scale, has been\r\nestablished at Tharrawaddy in Burma. About 500 officers of this class\r\nhave been appointed. In addition, there are about 11,000 subordinates,\r\nforesters and forest guards, who form the protective staff. The school\r\nat Dehra Dun has lately been converted into the Imperial Forest College.\r\n\r\nThe progress made since 1864 is really astonishing. According to the\r\nlatest available returns, the areas taken under the management of the\r\ndepartment are--reserved state forests, or permanent forest estates,\r\n91,272 sq. m.; other state forests, 141,669 sq. m.; or a total of\r\n232,941 sq. m., equal to 24% of the area over which they are scattered.\r\nAt present, therefore, the average charge of each member of the\r\ncontrolling staff comprises 1266 sq. m.; that of each executive officer,\r\n446 sq. m.; and that of each protective official, 21 sq. m. It is the\r\nintention to increase the executive and protective staff considerably,\r\nin the same degree as the management of the forests becomes more\r\ndetailed. Of the above-mentioned area the Forest Survey Branch,\r\nestablished in 1872, has up to date surveyed and mapped about 65,000 sq.\r\nm. From 1864 onwards efforts were made to introduce systematic\r\nmanagement into the forests, based upon working plans, but, as the\r\nmanagement had been provincialized, there was no central or continuous\r\ncontrol. This was remedied in 1884, when a central Working Plans Office,\r\nunder the inspector-general of forests, was established. This officer\r\nhas since then controlled the preparation and execution of the plans, a\r\nprocedure which has led to most beneficial results. Plans referring to\r\nabout 38,000 sq. m. are now (1909) in operation, and after a reasonable\r\nlapse of time there should not be a single forest of importance which is\r\nnot worked on a well-regulated plan, and on the principle of a sustained\r\nyield. While the danger of overworking the forests is thus being\r\ngradually eliminated, their yield capacity is increased by suitable\r\nsilvicultural treatment and by fire protection. Formerly most of the\r\nimportant forests were annually or periodically devastated by jungle\r\nfires, sometimes lighted accidentally, in other cases purposely. Now\r\n38,000 sq. m. of forest are actually protected against fire by the\r\nefforts of the department, and it is the intention gradually to extend\r\nprotection to all permanent state forests. Grazing of cattle is of\r\ngreat importance in India; at the same time it is liable to interfere\r\nseriously with the reproduction of the forests. To meet both\r\nrequirements careful and minute arrangements have been made, according\r\nto which at present 38,000 sq. m. are closed to grazing; 19,000 sq. m.\r\nare closed only against the grazing of goats, sheep and camels; while\r\n176,000 sq. m. are open to the grazing of all kinds of cattle. The areas\r\nclosed in ordinary years form a reserve of fodder in years of drought\r\nand scarcity. During famine years they are either opened to grazing, or\r\ngrass is cut in them and transported to districts where the cattle are\r\nin danger of starvation. The service rendered in this way by a wise\r\nforest administration should not be underrated, since one of the most\r\nserious calamities of a famine--the want of cattle to cultivate the\r\nland--is thus, if not avoided, at any rate considerably reduced. During\r\n1907 the government of India established a Research Institute, with six\r\nmembers engaged in collecting data regarding silviculture, forest\r\nbotany, forest zoology, forest economics, working plans, and chemistry\r\nin connexion with forest produce and production. The institute is likely\r\nto lead to further substantial progress in the management of the\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nThe financial results of forest administration in India for the years\r\n1865 to 1905 show the progress made:\r\n\r\n  +-----------+--------------+-----------------+\r\n  |           | Mean Annual  |  Percentage of  |\r\n  |  Period.  | Net Revenue. | Annual Increase |\r\n  |           |              |  during Period. |\r\n  +-----------+--------------+-----------------+\r\n  |           |   Rupees.    |                 |\r\n  |           |              |                 |\r\n  | 1865-1870 |  1,372,733   |       . .       |\r\n  | 1870-1875 |  1,783,248   |       30        |\r\n  | 1875-1880 |  2,224,687   |       25        |\r\n  | 1880-1885 |  3,385,745   |       52        |\r\n  | 1885-1890 |  5,066,671   |       50        |\r\n  | 1890-1895 |  7,370,572   |       44        |\r\n  | 1895-1900 |  7,923,484   |        7        |\r\n  | 1900-1905 |  9,004,367   |       12        |\r\n  +-----------+--------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nThe highest percentage of increase occurred in the period 1880-1885. The\r\nrevenue since 1886 has been considerably increased by the annexation of\r\nUpper Burma.\r\n\r\nApart from the net revenue, large quantities of produce are given free\r\nof charge, or at reduced rates, to the people of the country. Thus, in\r\n1904-1905, the net revenue amounted to Rs. 11,062,094, while the produce\r\ngiven free or at reduced rates was valued at Rs. 3,500,661, making a\r\ntotal net benefit derived from the state forests during that year of Rs.\r\n14,562,755, or in round figures one million pounds sterling. The\r\nout-turn during the same year amounted to 252 million cub. ft. of timber\r\nand fuel and 215 million bamboos. The receipts from the sale of other\r\nforest produce came to 9 million rupees, out of a total gross revenue of\r\n24 million rupees.\r\n\r\nThese results are highly creditable to the government of India, which\r\nhas led the way towards the introduction of rational forest management\r\ninto the British empire, thus setting an example which has been followed\r\nmore or less by various colonies. Even the movement in the United\r\nKingdom during late years is due to it. Apart from India, substantial\r\nprogress has been made in Cape Colony, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements\r\nand the Federated Malay States. Other British colonies are more backward\r\nin this respect. Energetic action is urgently wanted, especially in\r\nCanada and Australasia, where an enormous state property is threatened\r\nby destruction.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--The following works of special interest may be mentioned:\r\n  W.

The\r\nEastern forest is characterized by the predominance, on the whole, of\r\nbroad-leafed trees, the comparative uniformity of its general types over\r\nwide areas, and its naturally unbroken distribution. In the Western\r\nforest conifers are conspicuously predominant; the individual species\r\noften reaches enormous and even unequalled dimensions, the forest is\r\nfrequently interrupted by treeless areas, and the transitions from one\r\ntype to another are often exceedingly abrupt. Both divisions are\r\nbotanically and commercially rich in species.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern forest may conveniently be subdivided into three members:\r\n\r\n1. The Northern forest, marked by great density and large volume of\r\nstanding timber, and a comparative immunity, in its virgin condition,\r\nfrom fire. The characteristic trees are maples, birches and beech\r\n(_Fagus atropunicea_), among the hardwoods and white pine (_Pinus\r\nstrobus_), spruce (_Picea rubens_ and _Picea mariana_) and hemlock\r\n(_Tsuga canadensis_) among conifers.\r\n\r\n2. The Southern forest is on the whole less dense than the Northern, and\r\nmore frequently burned over. Among its characteristic trees are the\r\nlongleaf (_Pinus palustris_) and other pines, oaks, gums, bald cypress\r\n(_Taxodium distichum_) and white cedar (_Chamaecyparis thyoides_).\r\n\r\n3. The Central Hardwood forest, which differs comparatively little from\r\nadjacent portions of the Northern and Southern forests except in the\r\nabsence of conifers. Among its trees are the chestnut (_Castanea\r\ndentata_), hickories, ashes and other hardwoods already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Western division has two members:\r\n\r\n1. The Pacific Coast forest, marked by the great size of its trees and\r\nthe vast accumulations of merchantable timber. Among its characteristic\r\nspecies are the redwood (_Sequoia sempervirens_) and the big tree (_S.\r\nWashingtoniana_), the Douglas fir (_Pseudotsuga taxifolia_), sugar pine\r\n(_Pinus lambertiana_), western hemlock (_Tsuga heterophylla_), giant\r\narborvitae (_Thuja plicata_) and Sitka spruce (_Picea sitchensis_).\r\n\r\n2. The Rocky Mountain forest, whose characteristic species are the\r\nwestern yellow pine (_Pinus ponderosa_), Engelmann spruce (_Picea\r\nengelmanni_) and lodgepole pine (_Pinus murrayana_). This forest is\r\nfrequently broken by treeless areas of greater or less extent,\r\nespecially towards the south, and it suffers greatly from fire. Subarid\r\nin character, except to the north and at high elevations, the vast\r\nmining interests of the region and its treeless surroundings give this\r\nforest an economic value out of proportion to the quantities of timber\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of the various forests is indicated on the first of\r\nthe two accompanying maps. The second map shows the situation of the\r\nnational forests hereafter mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe forests of Alaska fall into two main divisions: the commercial\r\nthough undeveloped forests of the south-east coast, which occur along\r\nthe streams and on the lower slopes of the mountains and consist chiefly\r\nof western hemlock (_Tsuga heterophylla_), Sitka spruce (_Picea\r\nsitchensis_), yellow cedar (_Chamaecyparis nootkatensis_) and giant\r\narborvitae (_Thuja plicata_), usually of large size and uninjured by\r\nfire; and the vast interior forests, swept by severe fires, and\r\nconsisting chiefly of white and black spruces (_Picea canadensis_ and\r\n_nigra_), paper birch (_Betula papyrifera_) and aspen (_Populus\r\ntremuloides_), all of small size but of great importance in connexion\r\nwith mining. Northern Alaska and the extreme western coast regions are\r\nentirely barren.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forest Regions of the United States\r\n\r\n_The unshaded areas are treeless, except along the Streams_]\r\n\r\n_The National Forest Policy._--The forest policy of the United States\r\nmay be said to have had its origin in 1799 in the enactment of a law\r\nwhich authorized the purchase of timber suitable for the use of the\r\nnavy, or of land upon which such timber was growing. It is true that\r\nlaws were in force under the early governments of Massachusetts, New\r\nJersey and other colonies, providing for the care and protection of\r\nforest interests in various ways, but these laws were distinctly\r\nsurvivals of tendencies acquired in Europe, and for the most part of\r\nlittle use. It was not until the apparent approach of a dangerous\r\nshortage in certain timber supplies that the first real step in forest\r\npolicy was taken by the United States. Successive laws passed from 1817\r\nto 1831 strove to give larger effect to the original enactment, but\r\nwithout permanent influence towards the preservation of the live oak\r\n(_Quercus virginiana_ Mill.), which was the object in view. A long\r\nperiod of inaction followed these early measures. In 1831 the\r\nsolicitor of the treasury assumed a partial responsibility for the care\r\nand protection of the public timber lands, and in 1855 this duty was\r\ntransferred to the commissioner of the general land office in the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. The effect of these changes upon forest\r\nprotection was unimportant. When, however, at the close of the Civil War\r\nrailway building in the United States took on an unparalleled activity,\r\nthe destruction of forests by fire and the axe increased in a\r\ncorresponding ratio, and public sentiment began to take alarm. Action by\r\nseveral of the states slightly preceded that of the Federal government,\r\nbut in 1876 Congress, acting under the inspiration of a memorial from\r\nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science, authorized the\r\nappointment of an officer (Dr Franklin B. Hough) under the commissioner\r\nof agriculture, to collect and distribute information upon forest\r\nmatters. His office became in 1880 the division of forestry in what is\r\nnow the United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nAs the railways advanced into the treeless interior, public interest in\r\ntree-planting became keen. In 1873 Congress passed and later amended and\r\nrepealed the timber culture acts, which granted homesteads on the\r\ntreeless public lands to settlers who planted one-fourth of their\r\nentries with trees. Though these measures were not successful in\r\nthemselves they directed attention towards forestry. The act which\r\nrepealed them in 1891 contained a clause which lies at the foundation of\r\nthe present forest policy of the United States. By it the president was\r\nauthorized to set aside \"any part of the public lands wholly or in part\r\ncovered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not,\r\nas public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation,\r\ndeclare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.\"\r\nSome eighteen million acres had been proclaimed as reservations at the\r\ntime when, in 1896, the National Academy of Sciences was asked by the\r\nsecretary of the interior to make an investigation and report upon \"the\r\ninauguration of a rational forest policy for the forest lands of the\r\nUnited States.\" Upon the recommendation of a commission named by the\r\nAcademy, President Cleveland established more than twenty-one million\r\nacres of new reserves on the 22nd of February 1897. His action was\r\nwidely misunderstood and attacked, but it awakened a public interest in\r\nforest questions without which the rapid progress of forestry in the\r\nUnited States since that time could never have been made.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months after the proclamation of the Cleveland reserves the\r\npresent national forest policy took definite shape. Under this policy\r\nthe national government holds and manages, in the common interest of all\r\nusers of the forests or its products, such portions of the public lands\r\nas have been set aside by presidential proclamation in accordance with\r\nthe act of 1891. These lands are held against private acquisition under\r\nthe Homestead Act (except as to agricultural lands as hereafter\r\nmentioned), the Timber and Stone Act, and other laws under which the\r\nUnited States disposes of its unappropriated public domain, but not\r\nagainst private acquisition under the Mineral Land Laws. They are\r\nselected from lands believed to be more valuable for forest purposes\r\nthan for agriculture, and are managed with the purpose of securing from\r\nthem the best and largest possible returns, present and future, whether\r\nin the form of water for irrigation or power, of timber, of forage for\r\nstock, or of any other beneficial product. The aggregate area of the\r\nreserves, or national forests, has been steadily increased until they\r\nnow include nearly all the timber lands left of the public domain.\r\n\r\nThe general lines of this policy were in part laid down by the\r\ncommission already mentioned, in its report submitted to the secretary\r\nof the interior, May 1, 1897, and by the act of June 4, 1897, which was\r\nlargely shaped by the work of the commission. Until this act was passed\r\nthe national forests had been in theory closed against any form of use;\r\nnor had the possibility of securing forest preservation by wise use\r\nreceived much thought from those who had favoured their creation. Such a\r\nstate of affairs could not continue. Before long public opinion would\r\nhave forced the opening to use of the resources thus arbitrarily locked\r\nup, and in the absence of any administrative system providing for\r\nconservative use, the national forests would inevitably have been\r\nabolished, and the whole policy of government forest holdings would have\r\nceased. The act of June 4, 1897 was therefore of the first importance.\r\nThis act conferred upon the secretary of the interior general powers for\r\nthe proper management of the national forests through the general land\r\noffice of his department. It provided for the designation and sale of\r\ndead, mature and large timber; authorized the secretary to permit free\r\nuse of timber in small quantities by settlers, miners and residents;\r\nempowered him to \"make such rules and regulations and establish such\r\nservice as will insure the objects of such reservations, namely, to\r\nregulate their occupancy and use and to preserve the forests thereon\r\nfrom destruction\"; and made violation of the act or of such rules and\r\nregulations a misdemeanour. The statute limited the power to establish\r\nforest reservations to the purpose of improving and protecting the\r\nforest, securing favourable conditions of water flows, and furnishing a\r\ncontinuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of\r\nthe United States. Lands found, upon due examination, to be more\r\nvaluable for other purposes than for forest uses might be eliminated\r\nfrom any reservation, and all mineral lands within the reservations were\r\nleft open to private appropriation under the mineral laws. The rights of\r\nsettlers and claimants were safeguarded, and civil and criminal\r\njurisdiction, except so far as the punishment of offences against the\r\nUnited States in the reservations was concerned, was reserved to the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhile the administration of the national forests was entrusted to the\r\ngeneral land office, the same act assigned the surveying and mapping of\r\nthem to the United States Geological Survey, which has published\r\ndescriptions and maps of some of the more important.\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made in the general land office to develop a technical\r\nforest service. There were, indeed, at the time of passage of the act,\r\nless than ten trained foresters in the United States, no means of\r\ntraining more, and very little conception of what forestry actually\r\nmeant. The purpose of the administration was therefore mainly protection\r\nagainst trespass and fire, particularly the latter. Regulations were\r\nmade giving effect to the provisions of the act of June 4, set forth\r\nabove, but in the absence of technical knowledge as to what might safely\r\nbe done, the tendency was rather to restrict than to extend the use of\r\nthe forest. Meanwhile, however, there was rapidly developing in another\r\nbranch of the government service an organization qualified for actual\r\nforest management.\r\n\r\nOne year after the passage of the act of June 4, 1897, the division of\r\nforestry in the Department of Agriculture ceased to be merely a bureau\r\nof information, and became an active agency for introducing the actual\r\npractice of forestry among private owners and for conducting the\r\ninvestigations upon which a sound American forest practice could be\r\nbased. The work awakened great interest among forest owners, and exerted\r\na powerful educational influence upon the country at large. The division\r\nextended its work and became (July 1, 1901) the Bureau of Forestry. It\r\ndrew into its employment for a time nearly all the men who were\r\npreparing themselves in increasing numbers (at first abroad, then in the\r\nnewly-founded schools in the United States) for the profession of\r\nforestry, and was soon recognized as qualified to speak authoritatively\r\non technical questions connected with the administration of the national\r\nforests. This led to a request from the secretary of the interior for\r\nthe advice of the bureau on such questions. Working plans were\r\naccordingly undertaken for a number of the forests. The general land\r\noffice, however, was not ready to attempt active forest management.\r\nThough some timber was sold and the grazing of stock regulated to some\r\nextent, the main object of the land office administration continued to\r\nbe protection against fire. Many of the regulations which it made could\r\nnot be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of dispersal of the Federal government forest work\r\namong three separate agencies grew more and more apparent, until, on the\r\n1st of February 1905, control of the 63,000,000 acres of forest reserves\r\nwhich up to that time had been set aside was transferred from the\r\ngeneral land office to the Bureau of Forestry. In recognition of its\r\nnew duties the designation of the bureau became the Forest Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: National Forests and National Parks of the United States.]\r\n\r\nOther provisions of the act which affected the transfer were that forest\r\nsupervisors and rangers should be selected, so far as possible, from\r\nqualified citizens of the state or territory in which each forest was\r\nsituated, and that all money received from the sale of any products or\r\nthe use of any land or resources of the national forests should be\r\ncovered into the treasury and constitute a special fund for their\r\nprotection, administration, improvement and extension. Five days later a\r\nstatute gave forest officers the power to arrest trespassers; and on the\r\n3rd of March the lieu land selection law was repealed. This law had\r\nopened the way for grave abuses through the exchange of worthless land\r\nby private owners within the forests for an equal area of valuable\r\ntimber lands outside.\r\n\r\nThe law has been modified since by the change of the old name \"Forest\r\nReserves\" to \"National Forests.\" The act of June 11, 1906, opened to\r\nhomestead entry lands within national forests found by examination to be\r\nchiefly valuable for agriculture. The administration and improvement of\r\nthe national forests are now provided for directly by congressional\r\nappropriation. The power to create national forests conferred on the\r\npresident by the act of March 1891 has been repealed for the states of\r\nWashington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, but for no\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Service began in earnest the development of all the resources\r\nof the national forests. Mature timber was sold wherever there was a\r\ndemand for it and the permanent welfare of the forests and protection of\r\nthe streams permitted, but always so as to prevent waste, guard against\r\nfire, protect young growth and ensure reproduction. Regulations were\r\nadopted which allowed small sales to be made without formality or delay,\r\nsecured for the government the full value of timber sold, and eliminated\r\nunnecessary routine. Care was taken to safeguard the interests of the\r\ngovernment and provide for the maintenance of good technical standards.\r\nThe conduct of local business was entrusted to local officers. Large\r\ntransactions with general policies were controlled from Washington, but\r\nwith careful provision for first-hand knowledge and close touch with\r\nthe work in the field. Business efficiency and the convenience of the\r\npublic were carefully studied. In short, an organization was created\r\ncapable of handling safely, speedily and satisfactorily the complex\r\nbusiness of making useful a forest property of vast extent, scattered\r\nthrough sixteen different states of an aggregate area of over 1,500,000\r\nsq. m. and with a population of 9,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe growth since the 1st of July 1897 of the area of the national\r\nforests, of the expenditures of the government for forestry, and of the\r\nreceipts from the national forests, is shown by the statement which\r\nfollows. Though the act of June 4, 1897, became effective immediately\r\nupon its passage, the fiscal year 1899 was the first of actual\r\nadministration, because the first for which Congress made the\r\nappropriation necessary to carry out the law.\r\n\r\n  _Area of National Forests, Annual Expenditures of the Federal\r\n  Government for Forestry and National Forest Administration, and\r\n  Receipts from National Forests, 1898-1909._\r\n\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------+--------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n  |         |     Area of     |                    |              |                  |                  |                 |\r\n  | Fiscal  | National Forests|Division of Forestry|   General    |  Receipts from   |  Receipts from   |Expenditures upon|\r\n  | Year.[1]| at Close of Year|(Bureau of Forestry,| Land Office. | National Forests.| National Forests,|National Forests,|\r\n  |         |   (June 30).    |  Forest Service).  |              |                  |     per Acre.    |    per Acre.    |\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------+--------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n  |         |      Acres.     |         $          |       $      |          $       |         $        |        $        |\r\n  |  1898   |    40,866,184   |      20,000.00     |     . .      |        . .       |       . .        |       . .       |\r\n  |  1899   |    46,168,439   |      28,520.00     | 175,000.00   |       7,534.83   |     0.00016      |     0.0038      |\r\n  |  1900   |    46,515,039   |      48,520.00     | 210,000.00   |      36,754.02   |      .00078      |      .0045      |\r\n  |  1901   |    46,324,479   |      88,520.00     | 325,000.00   |      29,250.88   |      .00063      |      .0070      |\r\n  |  1902   |    51,896,357   |     185,440.00     | 300,000.00   |      25,431.87   |      .00049      |      .0060      |\r\n  |  1903   |    62,211,240   |     291,860.00     | 304,135.00   |      45,838.08   |      .00074      |      .0054      |\r\n  |  1904   |    62,611,449   |     350,000.00     | 375,000.00   |      58,436.19   |      .00093      |      .0072      |\r\n  |  1905   |    85,693,422   |     632,232.36[2]  | 217,907.64[2]|      73,276.15   |      .00085      |      .0059      |\r\n  |  1906   |   106,994,018   |   1,191,400.21     |     . .      |     767,219.96   |      .00717      |      .0089      |\r\n  |  1907   |   150,832,665   |   1,800,595.20     |     . .      |   1,571,059.44   |      .01041      |      .0097      |\r\n  |  1909   |   167,677,749   |   2,948,153.08     |     . .      |   1,807,276.66   |      .00931      |      .0151      |\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------+--------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nUntil 1906, the sole source of receipts was the sale of timber. In the\r\nfiscal year 1907, however, timber sales furnished less than half the\r\nreceipts. The following statement concerning the timber sales of the\r\nfiscal years 1904-1907 will serve to bring out the change that followed\r\nthe transfer of control to the forest service in the midst of the fiscal\r\nyear 1905:--\r\n\r\n  +--------+---------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n  | Fiscal |   Amount of   |  Amount of  | Receipts from |\r\n  | Year.  |  Timber Sold. | Timber Cut. | Timber Sales. |\r\n  +--------+---------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n  |        |     Bd.-ft.   |   Bd.-ft.   |       $       |\r\n  |  1904  |   112,773,710 |  58,435,000 |   58,436.19   |\r\n  |  1905  |   113,661,508 |  68,475,000 |   73,270.15   |\r\n  |  1906  |   328,230,326 | 138,665,000 |  245,013.49   |\r\n  |  1907  | 1,044,855,000 | 194,872,000 |  686,813.12   |\r\n  +--------+---------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThese figures show (1) a large excess each year in the amount of timber\r\nsold over that cut and paid for; (2) nine times as much timber sold at\r\nthe end of the four-year period as at the beginning and three times as\r\nmuch cut; and (3) a much higher price obtained per thousand board-feet\r\nat the end of the period than at the beginning. Each of these matters\r\ncalls for comment. The sales are of stumpage only; the government does\r\nno logging on its own account.\r\n\r\n1. More timber is sold each year than is cut and paid for, because many\r\nof the sales extend over several years. With increasing sales the amount\r\nsold each year for future removal has exceeded the amount to be removed\r\nduring that year under sales of earlier years. Large sales covering a\r\nterm of years are made because the national forests contain much\r\novermature timber, which needs removal, but which is frequently too\r\ninaccessible to be saleable in small amounts. To prevent speculation the\r\ntime allowed for cutting is never more than five years, and cutting must\r\nbegin at once and be continued steadily.\r\n\r\n2. The volume of sales has increased rapidly because much forest is ripe\r\nfor the axe, the demand is strong, and control by trained men makes it\r\nsafe to cut more freely. The increase is marked both in small and in\r\nlarge sales, but a score of sales for less than $5000 are made against\r\none for more. The total cut is still far below the annual increment of\r\nthe forests. As the demand grows restrictions must increase in order to\r\nhusband the present supply until the next crop matures.\r\n\r\n3. The stumpage price would seem on the face of the figures to have\r\nrisen from about one dollar to more than three dollars per thousand\r\nboard-feet. The receipts, however, for any one year are not exclusively\r\nfor the timber cut in that year, since payments are made in advance. In\r\nthe year 1907 the average price obtained was something less than $2.50\r\nper thousand. It is therefore true that stumpage prices have risen\r\ngreatly, although conditions new to the American lumbermen are imposed.\r\nFull utilization of all merchantable material, care of young growth\r\nin felling and logging, and the piling of brush, to be subsequently\r\nburned by the forest officers if burning is necessary, are among these\r\nconditions. Timber to be cut must first be marked by the forest\r\nofficers. Sales of more than $100 in value are made only after public\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nOnly the simplest forms of silviculture have as yet been introduced. The\r\nvast area of the national forests, the comparatively sparse population\r\nof the West, the rough and broken character of the forests themselves,\r\nand the newness of the problems which their management presents, make\r\nthe general application of intensive methods for the present\r\nimpracticable. Natural reproduction is secured. The selection system is\r\nmost used, often under the rough and ready method of an approximate\r\ndiameter limit, with the reservation of seed trees where needed. The\r\ntendency, however, is strongly towards a more flexible and effective\r\napplication of the selection principle, as a better trained field force\r\nis developed and as market conditions improve.\r\n\r\nOne conspicuous achievement was the reduction of loss by fires on the\r\nnational forests. During the unusually dry season of 1905 there were\r\nonly eight fires of any importance, and the area burned over amounted\r\nonly to about .16 of 1% of the total area. In 1900 about .12 of 1% was\r\nburned. This was accomplished by efficient patrol, co-operation of the\r\npublic, and by preventive measures, such as piling and burning the brush\r\non cut-over areas.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 1906 the largest source of income from the\r\nnational forests was their use for grazing. Stock-raising is one of the\r\nmost important industries of the West. Formerly cattle and sheep grazed\r\nfreely on all parts of the public domain. In the early days of the\r\nnational forests the wisdom of permitting any grazing at all upon them\r\nwas sharply questioned. Unrestricted grazing had led to friction between\r\nindividuals, the deterioration of much of the range through\r\noverstocking, and serious injury to the forests and stream flow. The\r\nforests of the West, however, are largely of open growth and contain\r\nmany grassy parks, the results of old fires, and many high mountain\r\nmeadows. Under proper regulations the grass and other forage plants\r\nwhich they produce in great quantity can be used without detriment to\r\nthe forests themselves, and with great benefit to the stock industry,\r\nwhich often can find summer pasturage nowhere else. Except in southern\r\nCalifornia grazing is now permitted on all national forests unless the\r\nwatersheds furnish water for domestic use; but the time of entering and\r\nleaving, the number of head to be grazed by each applicant, and the part\r\nof the range to be occupied are carefully prescribed. Planted areas and\r\ncut-over areas are closed to stock until the young growth is safe from\r\nharm, and goats are allowed only in the brushland of the foothills.\r\n\r\nThe results of regulation, in addition to the protection of forest\r\ngrowth and streams, are the prevention of disputes, improved range,\r\nbetter stock, stable conditions in the stock industry, and the best use\r\nof the range in the interest of progress and development. The first\r\nright to graze stock on the forests is given to residents, small owners\r\nand those who have used the range before. Thus the crowding out of the\r\nweaker by the stronger and of the settler by the roving outsider has\r\nbeen stopped. In 1906 the forest service began to impose a moderate\r\ncharge for the use of the national forest range. The following statement\r\nshows the amount of stock grazed on the national forests 1904-09, and\r\nthe receipts for the grazing charge:--\r\n\r\n  +------+------------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n  | Year.|    Number of     |   Number of    |   Receipts.   |\r\n  |      |Cattle and Horses.|Sheep and Goats.|               |\r\n  +------+------------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n  |      |                  |                |       $       |\r\n  | 1904 |      610,091     |   1,806,722    |      . .      |\r\n  | 1905 |      692,124     |   1,709,987    |      . .      |\r\n  | 1906 |    1,015,148     |   5,763,100    |   514,692.87  |\r\n  | 1907 |    1,200,158     |   6,657,083    |   863,920.32  |\r\n  | 1909 |    1,581,404     |   7,819,594    | 1,032,185.70  |\r\n  +------+------------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nA work of enormous magnitude which has now begun is planting on the\r\nnational forests. At present, with low stumpage prices and incomplete\r\nutilization of forest products, clear cutting with subsequent planting\r\nis not practicable. There are, however, many million acres of denuded\r\nland within the national forests which require planting. Such planting\r\nis still confined chiefly to watersheds which supply cities and towns\r\nwith water. The first planting was done in 1892, in California. Since\r\nthen similar work has been done on city watersheds in Colorado, Utah,\r\nIdaho and New Mexico. Other plantations are in the Black Hills national\r\nforest, where large areas of cut-over and burned-over land are entirely\r\nwithout seed trees, and in the sandhill region of Nebraska. Up to 1908\r\nabout 2,000,000 seedlings had been planted, on over 2000 acres--a small\r\nbeginning, but the work was entirely new and presented many hard\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nThe nursery operations of the forest service are concentrated at seven\r\nstations, located in southern California, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico\r\n(2), Utah and Idaho, where stock is raised for local planting and for\r\nshipment elsewhere. These nurseries are small. Their annual productive\r\ncapacity is between 8,000,000 and 10,000,000 seedlings. Each nursery is\r\npractically an experimental forest-planting station, at which a large\r\nvariety of species are grown and various methods are tried.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the administrative work of the national forests is\r\nby single forests. On the 1st of January 1908 the total number of\r\nforests was 165 with a total area of 162,023,190 acres (on April 7,\r\n1909, the numbers were 146 national forests in the U.S. with 167,672,467\r\nacres, besides two in Alaska with 26,761,626 and one in Porto Rico with\r\n65,950 acres). In charge of each forest is a forest supervisor. Under\r\nthe supervisors are forest rangers and forest guards, whose duties\r\ninclude patrol, marking timber and scaling logs, enforcing the\r\nregulations and conducting some of the minor business arising from the\r\nuse of the forests. Guards are temporary employes; rangers are employed\r\nby the year. The supervisors report directly to and receive instructions\r\nfrom the central office at Washington. In this office there are four\r\nbranches--operation, grazing, silviculture and products--each of which\r\ndirects that part of the work which belongs to it, dealing directly with\r\nthe supervisor. For inspection purposes, however, the forests are\r\nseparated into six districts, in each of which is located a chief\r\ninspector with a corps of assistants. The inspectors are without\r\nadministrative authority, but assist by their counsel the supervisors,\r\nand through inspection reports keep the Washington office informed of\r\nthe condition of all lines of administrative work in progress.\r\nAdministrative officers alternate frequently between field and office\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe number of forest officers in the several grades on the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1908 were: 6 chief inspectors, 26 inspectors, 106 forest\r\nsupervisors, 41 deputy forest supervisors, 820 forest rangers and 283\r\nforest guards. The total number of employes of the forest service on the\r\nsame date, including the clerical force, was 2034.\r\n\r\nBesides the administration of the national forests, the forest service\r\nconducts general investigations, carries on an extensive educational\r\nwork, and co-operates with private owners who contemplate forest\r\nmanagement upon their own tracts. This last work is undertaken because\r\nof the need of bringing forestry into practice, the lack of trained\r\nforesters outside of the employ of the government, and the lack of\r\ninformation as to how to apply forestry and what returns may be\r\nobtained. Co-operation takes the form of advice upon the ground and, on\r\noccasion, of the making of working plans. The educational work of the\r\nservice is performed chiefly through publications, the purpose of which\r\nis to spread very widely a knowledge of the importance of forestry to\r\nthe nation and of the principles upon which its practice rests. The\r\ninvestigations which the service conducts extend from studies of the\r\nnatural distribution and classification of American forests and of their\r\nvaried silvicultural problems to statistics of lumber production and\r\nlaboratory researches which bear upon the economical utilization of\r\nforest products. As examples of these researches may be mentioned tests\r\nof the strength of timber, studies of the preservative treatment of wood\r\nfor various uses, wood-pulp investigations and studies in wood\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\n_Forest Instruction._--Most of the men now in the forest service\r\nreceived their training in the United States. There are several\r\nprofessional schools of forestry. The Yale Forest School, which was\r\nopened as a department of Yale University in September 1900, offers a\r\ntwo-years' graduate course with abundant field work, and also conducts a\r\nsummer school of forestry, especially adapted to the training of forest\r\nrangers and special students, at Milford, Pennsylvania. The university\r\nof Michigan and Harvard University also offer a two-years' graduate\r\ncourse in forestry. The Pennsylvania State College has recently\r\nestablished a four-years' undergraduate course in forestry. The Biltmore\r\nForest School in North Carolina, the oldest of all these schools, offers\r\na one-year course in technical forestry. A large number of the\r\nagricultural colleges give instruction in forestry. Among these are\r\nNebraska, Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, Washington and Mississippi\r\nagricultural colleges, the university of Georgia and Iowa State College.\r\nBerea College, Kentucky, deserves special mention as a college which has\r\ndone valuable work in teaching forestry without attempting to turn out\r\nprofessional foresters.\r\n\r\n_Forestry among the States._--Among the states forestry has hardly\r\nreached the stage of practical application on the ground. New York holds\r\n1,500,000 acres of forest land. It has a commission to care for its\r\nforest preserve, and to protect the forest land throughout the state\r\nfrom fire. The constitution of the state, however, prohibits the cutting\r\nof timber on state land, and thus confines the work entirely to\r\nprotection of the forest and to the planting of waste areas.\r\nPennsylvania is at present showing the most efficient activity in\r\nworking out a forest policy. It has state forests of 820,000 acres, a\r\ngood fire law more and more satisfactorily enforced, and eight nurseries\r\nfor growing planting material. In 1905, 160,000 white pine seedlings\r\nwere set out. It has also a school for forest rangers, to be employed on\r\nthe state forests, and it has just established a state professional\r\nschool of forestry.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six of the states have regularly appointed forest officers, six\r\nhave carried on studies of forest conditions in co-operation with the\r\nforest service, and there is scarcely one which is not actively\r\ninterested in forestry. Laws, generally good, to prevent damage from\r\nforest fires, have been enacted by practically all the states, but\r\ntheir enforcement has unfortunately been lax. Public sentiment, however,\r\nis making rapid progress. Among the best laws are those of Maine, New\r\nHampshire, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The New York\r\nlaw, for example, provides for the appointment of one or more\r\nfire-wardens in each town of the counties in which damage by fire is\r\nespecially to be feared. In other counties supervisors of towns are\r\n_ex-officio_ fire-wardens. A chief fire-warden has general supervision\r\nof their work. The wardens, half of the cost of whose services is paid\r\nby the state, receive compensation only for the time actually employed\r\nin fighting fires. They may command the service of any citizen to assist\r\nthem. Setting fire to woods or waste lands belonging to the state or to\r\nanother, if such fire results in loss, is punishable by a fine not\r\nexceeding $250 or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, and\r\ndamages are provided for the person injured. Since fire is beyond\r\nquestion the most dangerous enemy of forests in the United States, the\r\nmeasures taken against it are of vital importance.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the amount of forest land held by the\r\ndifferent states, and by the territory of Hawaii:--\r\n\r\n  _Area of State Forest Reservations, 1907._\r\n\r\n  Connecticut       1,360 acres\r\n  Hawaii          117,532   \"\r\n  Indiana           2,000   \"\r\n  Maryland          3,540   \"\r\n  Michigan         39,000   \"\r\n  Minnesota        42,800   \"\r\n  New Jersey        2,474   \"\r\n  New York      1,439,998   \"\r\n  Pennsylvania    820,000   \"\r\n  Wisconsin       254,072   \"\r\n\r\n_Forestry on Private Lands._--The practice of forestry among private\r\nowners is of old date. One of the earliest instances was that of Jared\r\nEliot, who, in 1730, began the systematic cutting of timber land to\r\nsupply charcoal for an iron furnace at Old Salisbury, Connecticut. The\r\nsuccessful planting of waste lands with timber trees in Massachusetts\r\ndates from about ten years later. But such examples were comparatively\r\nrare until recent times. At present the intelligent harvesting of timber\r\nwith a view to successive crops, which is forestry, is much more common\r\nthan is usually supposed. Among farmers it is especially frequent. It\r\nwas begun among lumbermen by the late E.S. Coe, of Bangor, Maine, who\r\nmade a practice of restricting the cut of spruce from his forests to\r\ntrees 10, 12 or sometimes even 14 in. in diameter, with the result that\r\nmuch of his land yielded, during his life, a second crop as plentiful as\r\nthe first. Many owners of spruce lands have followed his example, but\r\nuntil very recently without improving upon it. Systematic forestry on a\r\nlarge scale among lumbermen was begun in the Adirondacks during the\r\nsummer of 1898 on the lands of Dr W.S. Webb and Hon. W.C. Whitney, of a\r\ncombined area of over 100,000 acres, under the superintendence of the\r\nthen Division of Forestry. In these forests spruce, maple, beech and\r\nbirch predominate, but the spruce alone is at present of the first\r\ncommercial importance. The treatment is a form of the selection system.\r\nUnder it a second crop of equal yield would be ripe for the axe in\r\nthirty-five years. Spruce and pine are the only trees cut. The work had\r\nbeen executed, at least up to the year 1902, with great satisfaction to\r\nthe owners and the lumbering contractors, as well as to the decided\r\nbenefit of the forest. The lumbering is regulated by the following\r\nrules, and competent inspectors are employed to see that they are\r\nrightly carried out: (1) No trees shall be cut which are not marked. (2)\r\nAll trees marked shall be cut. (3) No trees shall be left lodged in the\r\nwoods, and none shall be overlooked by the skidders or haulers. (4) All\r\nmerchantable logs which are as large as 6 in. in diameter at the small\r\nend must be utilized. (5) No stumps shall be cut more than 6 in. higher\r\nthan the stump is wide. (6) No spruce shall be used for bridges,\r\ncorduroy, skids, slides, or for any purpose except building camps, dams\r\nor booms, unless it is absolutely necessary on account of lack of other\r\ntimber. (7) All merchantable spruce used for skidways must be cut into\r\nlogs and hauled out. (8) Contractors must not do any unnecessary damage\r\nto young growth in lumbering; and if any is done, they must discharge\r\nthe men who did it.\r\n\r\nThese two instances of forestry have been most useful and effective\r\namong lumbermen and other owners of forest land in the north-east. Among\r\nthose which have followed their example are the Berlin Mills Paper\r\nCompany in northern New Hampshire, the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company in\r\nnorthern Michigan, and the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Company in New\r\nYork, all of which have employed professional foresters.\r\n\r\nThe most notable instance of forestry in the south is on the estate of\r\nGeorge W. Vanderbilt at Biltmore, N.C. This was the first case of\r\nsystematic forestry under regular working plans in the United States. It\r\nwas begun in 1891 on about 4000 acres, and has since been extended until\r\nit now covers about 100,000 acres. A professional forester with a corps\r\nof trained rangers under him is in charge of the work. The Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad has recently employed a trained forester and several assistants\r\nand has undertaken systematic forestry on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the work of the forest service in assisting private owners\r\nis evidenced by the fact that down to the year 1908 670 wood lots and\r\ntimber tracts had been examined by agents of the forest service, of\r\nwhich 250 were tracts over 400 acres in extent, and planting plans had\r\nbeen made for 436 owners covering a total area of 80,000 acres. Expert\r\nadvice is also given to wood lot owners upon application by many of the\r\nstate foresters.\r\n\r\n_American Practice._--The conditions under which forestry is practised\r\nin Europe and in America differ so widely that rules which are received\r\nas axiomatic in the one must often be rejected in the other. Among these\r\nconditions in America are the highly developed and specialized methods\r\nand machinery of lumbering, the greater facilities for transportation\r\nand consequent greater mobility of the lumber trade, the vast number of\r\nsmall holdings of forest land, and the enormous supply of low-grade wood\r\nin the timbered regions. High taxes on forest properties, cut-over as\r\nwell as virgin, notably in the north-western pineries, and the firmly\r\nestablished habits of lumbermen, are factors of great importance. From\r\nthese and other considerations it follows that such generally accepted\r\nessentials of European methods of forestry as a sustained annual yield,\r\na permanent force of forest labourers, a permanent road system and the\r\nlike, are in most cases utterly inapplicable in the United States at the\r\npresent day in private forestry. Methods of forest management, to find\r\nacceptance, must there conform as closely as possible to existing\r\nmethods of lumbering. Rules of marked simplicity, the observance of\r\nwhich will yet secure the safety of the forest, must open the way for\r\nmore refined methods in the future. For the present a periodic or\r\nirregular yield, temporary means of transport, constantly changing\r\ncrews, and an almost total ignorance of the silvics of all but a few of\r\nthe most important trees--all combine to enforce the simplest\r\nsilvicultural treatment and the utmost concentration of purpose on the\r\ntwo main objects of forestry, which are the production of a net revenue\r\nand the perpetuation of the forest. Such concentration has been followed\r\nin practice by complete success.\r\n\r\nThe forests with which the American forester deals are rich in species,\r\nusually endowed with abundant powers of reproduction, and, over a large\r\npart of their range, greatly dependent for their composition and general\r\ncharacter upon the action of forest fires. Of the commercially valuable\r\ntrees there may be said to be, in round numbers, a hundred out of a\r\ntotal forest flora of about 500 species, but many trees not yet of\r\nimportance in the lumber trade will become so hereafter, as has already\r\nhappened in many cases. The attention of the forester must usually be\r\nconcentrated upon the growth and reproduction of a single species, and\r\nnever of more than a very few. Thus the silvicultural problems which\r\nmust be solved in the practice of forestry in America are fortunately\r\nless complicated than the presence of so many kinds of trees in forests\r\nof such diverse types would naturally seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nThe forest fire problem is one of the most difficult with which the\r\nAmerican forester has to deal. It is probable that forest fires have\r\nhad more to do with the character and distribution of forests in America\r\nthan any other factor except rainfall. With an annual range over\r\nthousands of square miles, in many portions of the United States they\r\noccur regularly year after year on the same ground. Trees whose thick\r\nbark or abundant seeding gives them peculiar powers of resistance,\r\nfrequently owe their exclusive possessions of vast areas purely to the\r\naction of fire. On the economic side fire is equally influential. The\r\nprobability, or often the practical certainty, of fire after the first\r\ncut, commonly determines lumbermen to leave no merchantable tree\r\nstanding. Forest fires are thus the most effective barriers to the\r\nintroduction of forestry. Excessive taxation of timber land is another\r\nof almost equal effect. Because of it lumbermen hasten to cut, and\r\nafterwards often to abandon, lands which they cannot afford to hold.\r\nThis evil, which only the progress of public sentiment can control, is\r\nespecially prevalent in certain portions of the white pine belt.\r\n\r\n_Forest Associations._--Public sentiment in favour of the protection of\r\nforests is now widespread and increasingly effective throughout the\r\nUnited States. As the general understanding of the objects and methods\r\nof forestry becomes clearer, the tendency, formerly very marked, to\r\nconfound ornamental tree planting and botanical matters with forestry\r\nproper is rapidly growing less. At the same time, the number and\r\nactivity of associations dealing with forest matters is increasing with\r\nnotable rapidity. There are now about thirty such associations in the\r\nUnited States. One of these, the Society of American Foresters, is\r\ncomposed exclusively of professional foresters. The American Forestry\r\nAssociation is the oldest and largest. It has been influential in\r\npreparing the ground work of popular interest in forestry, and\r\nespecially in advocating and securing the adoption of the federal forest\r\nreservation policy, the most important step yet taken by the national\r\ngovernment. It publishes as its organ a monthly magazine called\r\n_Forestry and Irrigation_. The Pennsylvania Forestry Association has\r\nbeen instrumental in placing that state in the forefront of forest\r\nprogress. Its organ is a bi-monthly publication called _Forest Leaves_.\r\nOther states which have associations or societies of special influence\r\nin forest matters are California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado,\r\nNew Hampshire, Georgia and Oregon. Arbor Day, instituted in Nebraska in\r\n1872 as a day for shade-tree planting by farmers who had settled on the\r\ntreeless prairies, has been taken up as a means of interesting school\r\nchildren in the planting of trees, and has spread until it is now\r\nobserved in every state and territory. It continues to serve an\r\nadmirable purpose.\r\n\r\n_Lumbering._--According to the census report for 1905 the capital\r\ninvested in logging operations in the United States was $90,454,596, the\r\nnumber of employes engaged 146,596, and their wages $66,990,000;\r\nsawmills represented an invested capital of $381,621,000, and employed\r\n223,674 persons, whose wages were $100,311,000, while planing mills\r\nrepresented a capital of $222,294,000 and employed 132,030 persons\r\nwhose wages were $66,434,000.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+------------------------------+-----------+---------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                   |                              | Equivalent|Estimated|Estimated|Total Wood|\r\n  |     Product.      |         Output 1906.         |    Wood   |  Woods  |  Mill   |  Volume  |\r\n  |                   |                              |  Volume.  |Waste.[3]|Waste.[4]| Consumed.|\r\n  +-------------------+------------------------------+-----------+---------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                   |                              |  Million  | Million | Million | Million  |\r\n  |                   |                              |  cub. ft. | cub. ft.| cub. ft.| cub. ft. |\r\n  | Lumber--          |                              |           |         |         |          |\r\n  |   Conifers        |   30,200,000 thousand bd. ft.|   2517    |  1173   |  2170   |   5860   |\r\n  |   Hardwoods       |    7,300,000     \"      \"    |    612    |   577   |   461   |   1650   |\r\n  | Shingles          |   11,900,000     \"      \"    |    107    |    54   |   109   |    270   |\r\n  | Pulpwood          |    2,900,000 cords           |    261    |    79   |   . .   |    340   |\r\n  | Wood distillation |    1,200,000   \"             |    108    |    12   |   . .   |    120   |\r\n  | Heading           |  146,000,000 sets            |     32    |    33   |    45   |    110   |\r\n  | Staves--          |                              |           |         |         |          |\r\n  |   Tight cooperage |  267,000,000                 |     22    |    36   |    32   |     90   |\r\n  |   Slack cooperage |1,097,000,000                 |     27    |    22   |    21   |     70   |\r\n  | Poles             |    3,500,000                 |     35    |    15   |   . .   |     50   |\r\n  | Veneer            |      300,000 thousand bd. ft.|     50    |    30   |   . .   |     80   |\r\n  | Round mine timbers|  165,000,000 cub. ft.        |    165    |    35   |   . .   |    200   |\r\n  | Hewn cross ties   |   77,500,000                 |    207    |   503   |   . .   |    710   |\r\n  |                   |                              +-----------+---------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                   |                              |   4143    |  2569   |  2838   |   9550   |\r\n  +-------------------+------------------------------+-----------+---------+---------+----------+\r\n\r\nAll the operations of the lumber trade in the United States are\r\ncontrolled, and to no small degree determined, by the peculiar unit of\r\nmeasure which has been adopted. This unit, the board-foot, is generally\r\ndefined as a board one foot long, one foot wide and one inch thick, but\r\nin reality it is equivalent to 144 cub. in. of manufactured lumber in\r\nany form. To purchase logs by this measure one must first know about\r\nwhat each log will yield in one-inch boards. For this purpose a scale or\r\ntable is used, which gives the contents of logs of various diameters and\r\nlengths in board feet. Under such a standard the purchaser pays for\r\nnothing but the saleable lumber in each log, the inevitable waste in\r\nslabs and sawdust costing him nothing.\r\n\r\nThe table at foot gives the estimated consumption of wood for certain\r\npurposes in the United States in 1906.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this amount, an immense quantity of wood is used each\r\nyear for fuel, posts and other domestic purposes, and the total annual\r\nconsumption is not less than 20 billion cub. ft.\r\n\r\nThe years 1890 to 1906 were marked by rapid changes in the rank of the\r\nimportant timber trees with reference to the amount of timber cut, and a\r\nshifting of the important centres of production. Among coniferous trees,\r\nwhite pine has yielded successively to yellow pine and Douglas fir,\r\nwhile the scene of greatest activity has shifted from the Northern\r\nforest to the Southern, and from there is rapidly shifting to the\r\nPacific Coast. The total cut of coniferous lumber has increased\r\nsteadily, but that of the hardwoods is falling off, and in 1906 it was\r\n15% less than in 1899, while inferior hardwoods are gradually assuming\r\nmore and more importance, and the scene of greatest activity has passed\r\nfrom the middle west to the south and the Appalachian region.\r\n\r\n_Conifers._--The coniferous supply of the country is derived from four\r\nforest regions: (1) The Northern forest; (2) the Southern forest; (3)\r\nthe Pacific Coast forest; and (4) the Rocky Mountain forest.\r\n\r\n1. The Northern forest was long the chief source of the coniferous\r\nlumber production in the United States. The principal timber tree of\r\nthis region is the white pine, usually known in Europe as the Weymouth\r\npine. It has an average height when mature of 110 ft., with a diameter a\r\nlittle less than 3 ft., but the virgin timber is approaching exhaustion.\r\nWhite pine was one of the first trees to be cut extensively in the\r\nUnited States, and Maine, the pine tree state, was at first the centre\r\nof production. In 1851 the cut of white pine on the Penobscot river was\r\n144 million ft., that of spruce 14 million and of hemlock 11 million.\r\nThirty years later the pine cut had sunk to 23 million, spruce had risen\r\nto 118 million, and hemlock had passed pine by a million feet.\r\nMeanwhile, the centre of production had passed from the north woods to\r\nthe Lake States, and for many years this region was the scene of the\r\nmost vigorous lumbering activity in the world. The following figures\r\nshow the cut for the Lake States from 1873 to 1906. It is certain that\r\nthe remarkable decline in the cut of white pine which these figures show\r\nwill continue still farther.\r\n\r\n  1873  3,993,780,000  |  1890  8,597,659,352\r\n  1874  3,751,306,000  |  1891  7,879,948,349\r\n  1875  3,968,553,000  |  1892  8,594,222,802\r\n  1876  3,879,046,000  |  1893  7,326,263,782\r\n  1877  3,595,333,496  |  1894  6,821,516,412\r\n  1878  3,629,472,759  |  1895  7,050,669,235\r\n  1879  4,806,943,000  |  1896  5,725,763,035\r\n  1880  5,651,295,000  |  1897  6,233,454,000\r\n  1881  6,768,856,749  |  1898  6,155,300,000\r\n  1882  7,552,150,744  |  1899  6,056,508,000\r\n  1883  7,624,789,786  |  1900  5,485,261,000\r\n  1884  7,935,033,054  |  1901  5,336,000,000\r\n  1885  7,053,094,555  |  1902  5,294,000,000\r\n  1886  7,425,368,443  |  1903  4,792,000,000\r\n  1887  7,757,916,784  |  1904  4,220,000,000\r\n  1888  8,388,716,460  |  1905  3,777,000,000\r\n  1889  8,183,050,755  |  1906  3,032,000,000\r\n\r\nSecond to the white pine among the coniferous lumber trees of the\r\nNorthern forest is the hemlock (_Tsuga canadensis_). It is used chiefly\r\nfor construction purposes and furnishes a comparatively low grade of\r\nlumber.\r\n\r\nThe spruce (_Picea rubens_) is used chiefly for lumber, but it is in\r\nlarge and increasing demand in the manufacture of paper pulp. For the\r\nlatter purpose hemlock, poplar (_Populus tremuloides_ and _P.\r\ngrandidentata_) and several other woods are also employed, but on a\r\nsmaller scale. The total consumption of wood for paper in the United\r\nStates for 1906 was 3,660,000 cords, of which 2,500,000 was spruce. Of\r\nthis, however, 720,000 cords were imported from Canada.\r\n\r\n2. The chief product of the Southern forest is the yellow pine. This is\r\nthe collective term for the longleaf, shortleaf, loblolly and Cuban\r\npines. Of these the longleaf pine (_Pinus palustris_ Mill.), called\r\npitch-pine in Europe, is the most important. Its timber is probably\r\nsuperior in strength and durability to that of any other member of the\r\ngenus _Pinus_, and in addition to its value as a timber tree it is the\r\nsource of naval stores in the United States. The average size of the\r\nmature longleaf pine is 90 ft. in height and 20 in. in diameter.\r\nShortleaf (_Pinus echinata_) and loblolly (_P. taeda_) are other\r\nimportant members of this group. Their wood very closely resembles that\r\nof the longleaf pine and is often difficult to distinguish from it. The\r\ntrees are also of about the same size and height. Loblolly is, however,\r\nof more rapid growth. The total cut of yellow pine in 1906 was\r\n11,661,000,000 board ft.; it has perhaps not yet reached its maximum,\r\nbut is certainly near it.\r\n\r\nAnother important coniferous tree of the Southern forest is the bald\r\ncypress (_Taxodium distichum_), which grows in the swamps. The cut in\r\n1906 was 839,000,000 board ft., a gain of 69% over 1899.\r\n\r\n3. But the great supply of coniferous timber is now on the Pacific\r\nCoast. The Douglas fir (_Pseudotsuga taxifolia_), also known as Douglas\r\nspruce, red fir and Oregon pine, is the foremost tree in Oregon and\r\nWashington, and the redwood in California. When mature the Douglas fir\r\naverages 200 ft. in height and 4 ft. in diameter, and the redwood 225\r\nft. in height and 8 ft. in diameter. Other important trees of the\r\nPacific Coast are sugar pine (_Pinus lambertiana_), western red cedar\r\n(_Thuja plicata_), western larch (_Larix occidentalis_), Sitka spruce\r\n(_Picea sitchensis_), western hemlock (_Tsuga heterophylla_) and western\r\nyellow pine (_Pinus ponderosa_). These trees will all be of increasing\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nLogging on the Pacific Coast is characterized by the use of powerful\r\nmachinery and by extreme skill in handling enormous weights. This is\r\nespecially true in California, where the logs of redwood and of the big\r\ntree (_Sequoia Washingtoniana_) are often more than 10 ft. in diameter.\r\nLogging is usually done by wire cables operated by donkey-engines. The\r\njourney to the mill is usually by rail. The mills are often of great\r\nsize, built on piles over tide water and so arranged that their product\r\nis delivered directly from the saws and dry kilns to vessels moored\r\nalongside. The products of the Pacific Coast forest make their way over\r\nland to the markets of the central and eastern states and into foreign\r\nmarkets. Among the lumber-producing states, Washington has in seven\r\nyears jumped from fifth place to first, and its output has increased\r\nfrom 1,428,000,000 board ft. in 1899 to 4,305,000,000 ft. in 1906.\r\nOregon and California have increased their output from 734,000,000 each\r\nin 1899 to 1,605,000,000 and 1,349,000,000 ft. respectively in 1906. Of\r\nthe total output of these three states (7,259,000,000 ft.) 4,880,000,000\r\nft. is Douglas fir and 660,000,000 redwood.\r\n\r\n4. The important lumber trees of the Rocky Mountain forest are the\r\nwestern yellow pine, the lodgepole pine, the Douglas fir and the\r\nEngelmann spruce. The Douglas fir, here extremely variable in size and\r\nvalue, reaches in this region average dimensions of perhaps 80 ft. in\r\nheight by 2 ft. in diameter, the western yellow pine 90 ft. by 3 ft. and\r\nthe Engelmann spruce 60 ft. by 2 ft. Mining, railroad and domestic uses\r\nchiefly absorb the annual timber product, which is considerable in\r\nquantity, and of vast importance to the local population. The lumber\r\noutput of the Rocky Mountain region is, however, increasing very rapidly\r\nboth in the north and in the south-west. One of the largest mills in the\r\nUnited States is in Idaho.\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes the cut of the important coniferous\r\nspecies during the years 1899-1906:\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-------+-------+-------+------------------+\r\n  |              |       |       |       | Per Cent Increase|\r\n  |     Kind.    | 1899. | 1904. | 1906. | (+) or Decrease  |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |  (-) since 1899. |\r\n  +--------------+-------+-------+-------+------------------+\r\n  |              |Million|Million|Million|                  |\r\n  |              |  ft.  |   ft. |  ft.  |                  |\r\n  | Yellow Pine  | 9,659 |11,533 |11,661 |     +  20.7      |\r\n  | Douglas Fir  | 1,737 | 2,928 | 4,970 |     + 186.2      |\r\n  | White Pine   | 7,742 | 5,333 | 4,584 |     -  40.8      |\r\n  | Hemlock      | 3,421 | 3,269 | 3,537 |     +   3.4      |\r\n  | Spruce       | 1,448 | 1,304 | 1,645 |     +  13.6      |\r\n  | Western Pine |   944 | 1,279 | 1,387 |     +  46.9      |\r\n  | Cypress      |   496 |   750 |   839 |     +  69.3      |\r\n  | Redwood      |   360 |   519 |   683 |     +  83.2      |\r\n  | Cedar        |   233 |   223 |   358 |     +  53.7      |\r\n  |              +-------+-------+-------+------------------+\r\n  |              |26,040 | 27,138|29,664 |     +  14        |\r\n  +--------------+-------+-------+-------+------------------+\r\n\r\n_Hardwoods._--The hardwood supply of the country is derived almost\r\nentirely from the eastern half of the continent, and comes from each of\r\nthe three great Eastern forest regions.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the cut of the important species of hardwoods\r\nfor 1899 and 1906:\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n  |              |           |           |    Per Cent     |\r\n  |     Kind.    |   1899.   |   1906.   |   Increase (+)  |\r\n  |              |           |           | or Decrease (-).|\r\n  +--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n  |              | Thousand  | Thousand  |                 |\r\n  |              |  Feet.    |  Feet.    |                 |\r\n  | Oak          | 4,438,027 | 2,820,393 |    -  36.5      |\r\n  | Maple        |   633,466 |   882,878 |    +  39.4      |\r\n  | Poplar       | 1,115,242 |   693,076 |    -  37.9      |\r\n  | Red gum      |   285,417 |   453,678 |    +  59.0      |\r\n  | Chestnut     |   206,688 |   407,379 |    +  97.1      |\r\n  | Basswood     |   308,069 |   376,838 |    +  22.3      |\r\n  | Birch        |   132,601 |   370,432 |    + 179.4      |\r\n  | Cottonwood   |   415,124 |   263,996 |    -  36.4      |\r\n  | Beech        |       (a) |   275,661 |                 |\r\n  | Elm          |   456,731 |   224,795 |    -  50.8      |\r\n  | Ash          |   269,120 |   214,460 |    -  20.8      |\r\n  | Hickory      |    96,636 |   148,212 |    +  53.4      |\r\n  | Tupelo       |       (a) |    47,882 |                 |\r\n  | Walnut       |    38,681 |    48,174 |    +  24.5      |\r\n  | Sycamore     |    29,715 |       (a) |                 |\r\n  | All other    |   208,504 |    87,637 |    -  58.0      |\r\n  +--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n  |    Total     | 8,634,021 | 7,315,491 |    -  15.3      |\r\n  +--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n  a Not separately reported.\r\n\r\nOak, which in 1899 furnished over half the entire output, has fallen off\r\n36.5%. Yellow poplar, which in 1899 was second among the hardwoods, has\r\nfallen off 38% and now occupies third place; and elm, the great stand-by\r\nin slack cooperage, has fallen 50.8%. On the other hand less valuable\r\nspecies like maple and red gum have advanced 39 and 59% respectively.\r\n\r\nThe decrease is largely due to the fact that the hardwoods grow\r\nnaturally on the better classes of soil, and in the eastern United\r\nStates where the population has always been the densest, and as a\r\nconsequence of this, a large proportion of the original hardwood land\r\nhas been cleared up and put under cultivation. The hardwood supply of\r\nthe future must be obtained chiefly from the Appalachian region, where\r\nthe conditions are less favourable to agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lumber cut, enormous quantities of hardwoods are used\r\neach year for railroad ties, telephone and other poles, piles, fence\r\nposts and fuel, and there is a great amount of waste in the course of\r\nlumbering and manufacture.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Sargent, _Silva of North America_ (Boston, 1891-1897),\r\n  _Manual of Trees of North America_ (Boston, 1903); Lemmon, _Handbook\r\n  of West American Cone-Bearers_ (San Francisco, 1895); Bruncken, _North\r\n  American Forests and Forestry_ (New York, 1900); Fernow, _Economics of\r\n  Forestry_ (New York, 1902); Pinchot, _The Adirondack Spruce_ (New\r\n  York, 1898); Pinchot and Graves, _The White Pine_ (New York, 1896).\r\n  See also the various publications of the U.S. forest service,\r\n  including especially the following general works: _Forest Influences_;\r\n  _Primer of Forestry_; the _Timber Supply of the United States_; the\r\n  _Waning Hardwood Supply_; _Forest Products of the United States in\r\n  1906_; _Exports and Imports of Forest Products in 1906_; _Federal and\r\n  State Forest Laws_; _Regulations and Instructions for the Use of the\r\n  National Forests_; _The Use of the National Forests_; also part v. of\r\n  the _Nineteenth and of the Twenty-first Annual Reports of the United\r\n  States Geological Survey_, and vol. ix. of the _10th Census Report on\r\n  the Forests of North America_; and _Reports_ of the State Forestry\r\n  Commissions of New York, New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Michigan,\r\n  Ohio, &c., and of the State Geological Surveys of New Jersey, Maryland\r\n  and North Carolina.

He\r\ntook part in the earlier Algerian campaigns, and became captain in 1835.\r\nFour years later he was given command of a battalion of _chasseurs a\r\npied_ and in 1844 he became colonel. At the Revolution of 1848 Cavaignac\r\nmade him a general of brigade. He took an active part in the _coup\r\nd'etat_ of the 2nd of December 1851, and Napoleon III. made him a\r\ngeneral of division shortly afterwards. He held a superior command in\r\nthe Crimean War, and in the Italian campaign of 1859 distinguished\r\nhimself very greatly in the action of Montebello (20th May). In 1862\r\nForey was placed in command of the French expeditionary corps in Mexico,\r\nwith the fullest civil and military powers, and he crowned a successful\r\ncampaign by the capture of Mexico city in May 1863, receiving as his\r\nreward the marshal's baton. From December 1863 to 1867 he held high\r\ncommands in France, but in the latter year he was struck with paralysis\r\nand had to retire. Marshal Forey died at Paris on the 20th of June 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORFAR, a royal, municipal and police burgh, and capital of the county\r\nof Forfarshire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 12,117. It lies at the east end of\r\nthe Loch of Forfar in the valley of Strathmore, and is 13 m. N. by E. of\r\nDundee by road and 21-1/4 m. by the Caledonian railway. It is also\r\nsituated on the same company's main line to Aberdeen and sends off a\r\nbranch to Brechin. The principal buildings comprise the court house, the\r\ncounty hall (with portraits by Raeburn, Romney, Opie and others), the\r\ntown hall, the Meffan Institute (including the free library), the\r\ninfirmary, poorhouse and the Reid hall, founded by Peter Reid, a\r\nmerchant in the burgh who also gave the public park. The burgh unites\r\nwith Montrose, Arbroath, Brechin and Inverbervie (the Montrose group of\r\nburghs) in returning one member to parliament. The Loch of Forfar, 1-1/4\r\nm. long by 1/4 m. wide, is drained by Dean Burn, and contains pike and\r\nperch. On a gravel bank or spit in the north-west of the lake stood a\r\ncastle which was sometimes used as a residence by Margaret, queen of\r\nMalcolm Canmore. The staple industries are linen and jute manufactures,\r\nbut brewing, tanning, bleaching, rope-making and iron-founding are also\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nForfar is at least as old as the time of Malcolm Canmore, for the first\r\nparliament after the defeat of Macbeth met in the old castle, which\r\nstood on a mound on the northern side of the town. The parliaments of\r\nWilliam the Lion, Alexander II. and Robert II. also assembled within its\r\nwalls. The town, which was created a royal burgh by David I., was burnt\r\ndown about the middle of the 13th century. Edward I. captured the\r\ncastle on one of his incursions, but in 1307 Robert Bruce seized it,\r\nput its defenders to the sword and then destroyed it, its site being now\r\nmarked by the town cross. Previous to the reign of James VI. the weekly\r\nmarket was held on Sunday, but after the union of the crowns parliament\r\nenacted that it should be held on Friday. The town sided with Charles I.\r\nduring the Civil War, and Charles II. presented the Cross to it out of\r\nregard for the loyalty shown to his father. Forfar seems to have played\r\na less reputable part in the persecution of witches. In 1661 a crown\r\ncommission was issued for the trial of certain miserable creatures, some\r\nof whom were condemned to be burnt. In the same year one John Ford for\r\nhis services as a witch-finder was admitted a burgess along with Lord\r\nKinghorne. The witches' bridle, a gag to prevent them from speaking\r\nwhilst being led to execution, is still preserved in the county hall.\r\nOne mile to the E. lie the ruins of Restennet Priory, where a son of\r\nRobert Bruce was buried. For twenty five years after the Reformation it\r\nwas used as the parish church and afterwards by the Episcopalians, until\r\nthey obtained a chapel of their own in 1822.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORFARSHIRE, or ANGUS, an eastern county of Scotland, bounded N. by the\r\nshires of Kincardine and Aberdeen, W. by Perthshire, S. by the Firth of\r\nTay and E. by the North Sea. It has an area of 559,171 acres, or 873.7\r\nsq. m. The island of Rossie and the Bell Rock belong to the shire.\r\n\r\nForfarshire is characterized by great variety of surface and may be\r\ndivided physically into four well-marked sections. In the most northerly\r\nof these many of the rugged masses of the Grampians are found; this belt\r\nis succeeded by Strathmore, or the Howe of Angus, a fertile valley, from\r\n6 to 8 m. broad, which is a continuation of the Howe of the Mearns, and\r\nruns south-westwards till it enters Strathearn, to the south-west of\r\nPerth; then come the Sidlaw Hills and a number of isolated heights,\r\nwhich in turn give way to the plain of the coast and the Firth. The\r\nmountains are all in the northern division and belong to the Binchinnin\r\ngroup (sometimes rather inexactly called the Braes of Angus) of the\r\nGrampian ranges. Among the highest masses, most of which lie on or near\r\nthe confines of the bordering counties, are Glas Maol(3502 ft.), on the\r\nsummit of which the shires of Aberdeen, Forfar and Perth meet,\r\nCairn-na-Glasha (3484), Fafernie (3274), Broad Cairn (3268), Creag\r\nLeacach (3238), Tolmount (3143), Tom Buidhe (3140), Driesh (3105), Mount\r\nKeen (3077) and Mayar (3043), while peaks of upwards of 2000 ft. are\r\nnumerous. The Sidlaw Hills--the greater part of which, however, belongs\r\nto Perthshire--are much less lofty and of less striking appearance. They\r\nhave a breadth of from 3 to 6 m., the highest points within the county\r\nbeing Craigowl Hill (1493 ft.), Auchterhouse Hill (1399) and Gallow Hill\r\n(1242). None of the rivers is navigable, and only three are of any\r\nimportance. The Isla, rising in Cairn-na-Glasha, flows southwards, then\r\nturns S.E. and finally S.W. till it enters the Tay after a course of 45\r\nm. Its chief tributaries on the right are the Alyth, Ericht and Lunan,\r\nand on the left the Newton, Melgam and Dean. Near Bridge of Craig is the\r\nfall of Reekie Linn (70 ft.), so named from the fact that when the\r\nstream is in flood the spray rises in a dense cloud like smoke (_reek_).\r\nNear old Airlie Castle are the cascades called the Slugs of Auchrannie.\r\nThe North Esk, formed by the confluence of the Lee and Mark at\r\nInvermark, after a south-easterly course of 28 m. enters the North Sea 3\r\nm. N. of Montrose. On the right bank it receives the West Water and\r\nCruick and on the left the Tarf and Luther. It gives the title of earl\r\nof Northesk to a branch of the Carnegie family. The South Esk rises in\r\nthe Grampians near Mount Fafernie and not far from its source forms the\r\nFalls of Bachnagairn; after flowing towards the south-east, it bends\r\neastwards near Tannadice and reaches the North Sea at Montrose, the\r\nlength of its course being 48 m. Its principal affluents are the Prosen\r\non the right and the Noran on the left. It supplies the title of earl of\r\nSouthesk to another branch of the Carnegies. The lakes are small, the\r\ntwo largest being the Loch of Forfar and the mountain-girt Loch Lee (1\r\nm. long by 1/4 m. wide). Lintrathen (circular in shape and about 3/4 m.\r\nacross), to the north of Airlie Castle, supplies Dundee with drinking\r\nwater. The glens of the Forfarshire Grampians are remarkable for their\r\nbeauty, and several of them for the wealth of their botanical specimens.\r\nThe largest and finest of them are Glen Isla, in which are the ruins of\r\nForter Castle, destroyed by Argyll in 1640, and the earl of Airlie's\r\nshooting-lodge of the Tulchan; Glen Clova, near the entrance to which\r\nstands Cortachy Castle, the seat of the earl of Airlie; Glen Esk and\r\nGlen Prosen.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--A great earth fracture traverses this county from near\r\n  Edzell on the N.E. to Lintrathen Loch on the S.W. Between Cortachy and\r\n  the south-western boundary this fault runs in Old Red Sandstone, but\r\n  north-east of that place it forms the junction line of Silurian and\r\n  Old Red; and in a general way we may say that on the N.W. side of the\r\n  fault the metamorphosed Silurian rocks are found, while the remainder\r\n  of the county is occupied by the Old Red Sandstone. On the margin of\r\n  the disturbance the Silurian rocks are little-altered grey and green\r\n  clay slates with bands of pebbly grit; farther towards the N.W. we\r\n  find the same rocks metamorphosed into mica schists and gneisses with\r\n  pebbly quartzites. Rising up through the schists between Carn Bannock\r\n  and Mount Battock is a great mass of granite. The Old Red Sandstone\r\n  extends from this county into Perthshire and Kincardineshire; here\r\n  some 20,000 ft. of these deposits are seen; an important part being\r\n  formed of volcanic tuffs and lavas which are regularly interbedded in\r\n  the sandstones and conglomerates. North of Dundee some of the lower\r\n  beds are traversed by intrusive dolerites, and Dundee Law is probably\r\n  the remains of an old vent through which some of the contemporaneous\r\n  lavas, &c., were discharged. The Old Red Rocks have been subjected to\r\n  a good deal of folding, as may be seen along the coast. The principal\r\n  direction of strike is from N.E. to S.W. A synclinal fold occupies\r\n  Strathmore, and between Longforgan and Montrose the northern extension\r\n  of the Sidlaw Hills is an anticlinal fold. Two fish-bearing beds occur\r\n  in the county; from the lower one many large _Eurypterids_ have been\r\n  obtained. The well-known paving flags of Arbroath belong to the lower\r\n  part of the formation. The Upper Old Red Sandstone is found only in\r\n  one spot about a mile north of Arbroath. During the Glacial period the\r\n  ice travelled south-eastward across Strathmore and over the Sidlaw\r\n  Hills; abundant evidence of this transporting agent is to be seen in\r\n  the form of morainic deposits, the most striking of which is the great\r\n  transverse barrier of Glenairn in the valley of the S. Esk, half a\r\n  mile in length and about 200 ft. high. Relics of the same period are\r\n  found round the coast in the form of raised beaches at 100, 50 and 25\r\n  ft. above the present sea-level.\r\n\r\n_Climate and Agriculture._--On the whole the climate is healthy and\r\nfavourable to agricultural pursuits. The mean temperature for the year\r\nis 47.3 deg. F., for January 38 deg. and for July 59 deg. The average\r\nannual rainfall is 34 in., the coast being considerably drier than the\r\nuplands. In the low-lying districts of the south the harvest is nearly\r\nas early as it is in the rest of Scotland, but in the north it is often\r\nlate. The principal wheat districts are Strathmore and the neighbourhood\r\nof Dundee and Arbroath; and the yield is well up to the best Scottish\r\naverage. Barley, an important crop, has increased steadily. Oats,\r\nhowever, though still the leading crop, have somewhat declined. Potatoes\r\nare mostly grown near the seaboard in the higher ground; turnips also\r\nare largely raised. The northern belt, where it is not waste land, has\r\nbeen turned into sheep walks and deer forests. The black-faced sheep are\r\nthe most common in the mountainous country; cross-bred sheep in the\r\nlowlands. Though it is their native county (where they date from 1808),\r\npolled Angus are not reared so generally as in the neighbouring shire of\r\nAberdeen, but shorthorns are a favourite stock and Irish cattle are\r\nimported for winter-feeding. Excepting in the vicinity of the towns\r\nthere are no dairy farms. Horses are raised successfully, Clydesdales\r\nbeing the commonest breed, but the small native garrons are now little\r\nused. Pigs also are reared. Save perhaps in the case of the crofts, or\r\nvery small holdings of less than 10 acres, farm management is fully\r\nabreast of the times.\r\n\r\n_Other Industries._--The staple industries are the jute and flax\r\nmanufactures. Their headquarters are in Dundee, but they flourish also\r\nat other places. Shipbuilding is carried on at Dundee, Arbroath and\r\nMontrose. The manufactures of jams, confectionery, leather, machinery,\r\nsoap and chemicals, are all of great and growing value. Sandstone\r\nquarries employ many hands and the deep-sea fisheries, of which Montrose\r\nis the centre, are of considerable importance. The netting of salmon at\r\nthe mouth of the North Esk is also a profitable pursuit.\r\n\r\nTwo railway companies serve the county. The North British, entering from\r\nthe south by the Tay Bridge, follows the coast north-eastwards, sending\r\noff at Montrose a branch to Bervie. The Caledonian runs up Strathmore to\r\nForfar, whence it diverges due east to Guthrie, where it again resumes\r\nits north-easterly course to Dubton and Marykirk; it reaches Dundee from\r\nPerth by the shore of the estuary of the Tay, and sends branches from\r\nDundee to Kirriemuir via Monikie and Forfar and to Alyth Junction via\r\nNewtyle, while a short line from Dubton gives it touch with Montrose.\r\n\r\n_Population and Government._--The population was 277,735 in 1891, and\r\n284,083 in 1901, when 1303 spoke Gaelic and English, and 13 Gaelic only.\r\nThe chief towns are Arbroath (pop. in 1901, 22,398), Brechin (8941),\r\nBroughty Ferry (10,484), Carnoustie (5204), Dundee (161,173), Forfar\r\n(11,397), Kirriemuir (4096), Monifieth (2134) and Montrose (12,427).\r\nForfarshire returns one member to Parliament. It is a sheriffdom and\r\nthere is a resident sheriff-substitute at Dundee and another at Forfar,\r\nthe county town, and courts are held also at Arbroath. In addition to\r\nnumerous board schools there are secondary schools at Dundee, Montrose,\r\nArbroath, Brechin, Forfar and Kirriemuir, and technical schools at\r\nDundee and Arbroath. Many of the elementary schools earn grants for\r\nhigher education. The county council and the Dundee and Arbroath town\r\ncouncils expend the \"residue\" grant in subsidizing science and art and\r\ntechnical schools and classes, including University College, the textile\r\nschool, the technical institute, the navigation school, and the workshop\r\nschools at Dundee, the technical school at Arbroath, besides cookery,\r\ndairy, dress-cutting, laundry, plumbing and veterinary science classes\r\nat different places.\r\n\r\n_History._--In the time of the Romans the country now known as\r\nForfarshire was inhabited by Picts, of whose occupation there are\r\nevidences in remains of weems, or underground houses. Traces of Roman\r\ncamps and stone forts are common, and there are vitrified forts at\r\nFinhaven, Dumsturdy Muir, the hill of Laws near Monifieth and at other\r\npoints. Spearheads, battle-axes, sepulchral deposits, Scandinavian\r\nbronze pins, and other antiquarian relics testify to periods of storm\r\nand stress before the land settled down into order, towards which the\r\nChurch was a powerful contributor. In the earliest days strife was\r\nfrequent. The battle in which Agricola defeated Galgacus is supposed to\r\nhave occurred in the Forfarshire Grampians (A.D. 84); the Northumbrian\r\nKing Egfrith and the Pictish king Burde fought near Dunnichen in 685,\r\nthe former being slain; conflicts with the Danes took place at Aberlemno\r\nand other spots; Elpin king of the Scots was defeated by Aengus in the\r\nparish of Liff in 730; at Restennet, about 835, the Picts and Scots had\r\na bitter encounter. In later times the principal historical events,\r\nwhether of peace or war, were more immediately connected with burghs\r\nthan with the county as a whole. There is some doubt whether the county\r\nwas named Angus, its title for several centuries, after a legendary\r\nScottish prince or from the hill of Angus to the east of the church of\r\nAberlemno. It was early governed by hereditary earls and was made a\r\nhereditary sheriffdom by David II. The first earl of Angus (by charter\r\nof 1389) was George Douglas, an illegitimate son of the 1st earl of\r\nDouglas by Margaret Stuart, who was countess of Angus in her own right.\r\nOn the death of the 1st and only duke of Douglas, who was also 13th earl\r\nof Angus, in 1761, the earldom merged in the dukedom of Hamilton.\r\nPrecisely when the shire became known by the name of the county town has\r\nnot been ascertained, but probably the usage dates from the 16th\r\ncentury. Among old castles are the roofless square tower of Red Castle\r\nat the mouth of the Lunan; the tower of the castle of Auchinleck; the\r\nstronghold of Inverquharity near Kirriemuir; the castle of Finhaven; the\r\ntwo towers of old Edzell Castle; the ruins of Melgund Castle, which are\r\nfairly complete; the small castle of Newtyle, and the old square tower\r\nand gateway of the castle of Craig.\r\n\r\n  See A. Jervise, _Memorials of Angus and Mearns_ (Edinburgh, 1895);\r\n  _Land of the Lindsays_ (Edinburgh, 1882); _Epitaphs and Inscriptions_\r\n  (Edinburgh, 1879); Earl of Crawford, _Lives of the_ _Lindsays_\r\n  (London, 1835); Sir W. Fraser, _History of the Carnegies_ (Edinburgh,\r\n  1867); A.H. Millar, _Historical Castles and Mansions_ (Paisley, 1890);\r\n  G. Hay, _History of Arbroath_ (Arbroath, 1876); D.D. Black, _History\r\n  of Brechin_ (Edinburgh, 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORFEITURE (from \"forfeit,\" originally an offence, and hence a fine\r\nexacted as a penalty for such; derived through the O. Fr. _forfait_,\r\nfrom the late Lat. _foris factum_, a trespass, that which is done\r\n_foris_, outside), in English law, the term applied (1) to loss or\r\nliability to the loss of property in consequence of an offence or breach\r\nof contract; (2) to the property of which the party is deprived.\r\n\r\nUnder the common law, conviction and attainder on indictment for treason\r\nor felony was followed not only by forfeiture of the life of the\r\noffender, but also by forfeiture of his lands and goods. In the case of\r\ntreason all the traitor's lands of whomsoever holden were forfeited to\r\nthe king; in the case of felony (including _felo-de-se_, or suicide),\r\nthe felon's lands escheated (_exceciderunt_) to his immediate lord,\r\nsubject to the king's right to waste them for a year and a day. This\r\nrule did not apply to lands held in gavelkind in the county of Kent. The\r\ngoods of traitors and felons were forfeited to the king. The desire of\r\nthe king and his officers to realize the profits of these forfeitures\r\nwas one of the chief motives for instituting the circuits of the king's\r\njustices throughout England; and from time to time conflicts arose from\r\nattempts by these justices to extend the law of treason--under which the\r\nking levied all the forfeitures--at the expense of felony, in which the\r\nlord of the felon benefited by the escheats. As regards theft, the\r\nking's rights overrode those of the owner of the stolen property, until,\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII., provision was made for restitution of the\r\ngoods to the owner if he prosecuted the thief to conviction. In Pepys's\r\n_Diary_, 21st of January 1667-1668, will be found an illustration of the\r\nworking of the old law. We find that on the suicide of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Pepys at once applied to the king personally and\r\nobtained a grant of the brother-in-law's estate in favour of his widow\r\nand children should the inquest find a verdict of _felo-de-se_. It was\r\ncommon practice for persons anticipating conviction for treason or\r\nfelony to assign all their property to others to avoid the forfeiture;\r\nand in some instances the accused refused to plead to the indictment and\r\nendured the _peine forte et dure_, until death supervened, to avoid\r\nthese consequences of conviction. The royal rights to forfeitures\r\narising within particular areas were frequently granted by charter to\r\ncorporations or individuals. In 1897 the courts had to interpret such\r\ncharters granted to the town of Nottingham in 1399 and 1448. All\r\nforfeitures and escheats with respect to conviction and attainder for\r\ntreason and felony were abolished as from the 4th of July 1870, except\r\nforfeitures consequent upon the now disused process of outlawry, and the\r\nforfeitures included in the penalties of praemunire.\r\n\r\nThe term \"forfeit\" is also applied to penalties imposed by statute for\r\nacts or omissions which are neither treasonable nor felonious. In such\r\nstatutes the forfeiture enures in favour of the crown unless the statute\r\nindicates another destination; and unless a particular method of\r\nenforcing the forfeiture is indicated it is enforceable as a debt to the\r\ncrown and has priority as such. The words \"forfeit and pay\" are often\r\nused in imposing a pecuniary penalty for a petty misdemeanour, and where\r\nthey are used the court dealing with the case must not only convict the\r\noffender but adjudicate as to the forfeiture.\r\n\r\nStatutory forfeitures in some cases extend to specific chattels, e.g. of\r\na British merchant-ship when her character as such is fraudulently\r\ndissimulated (Merch. Shipp. Act 1894, ss. 70, 76), or of goods smuggled\r\nin contravention of the customs acts or books introduced in violation of\r\nthe copyright acts. Recognisances are said to be forfeited when the\r\nconditions are broken and an order of court is made for their\r\nenforcement as a crown debt against the persons bound by them.\r\n\r\nThe term \"forfeiture\" is now most commonly used with reference to real\r\nproperty, i.e. with reference to the rights of lords of the manor or\r\nlessors to determine the estate or interest of a copyholder or lessee\r\nfor breach of the customary or contractual terms of tenure. It is also\r\napplied to express the deprivation of a limited owner of settled\r\nproperty, real or personal, for breach of the conditions by which his\r\nrights are limited; e.g. by becoming bankrupt or attempting to charge or\r\nalienate his interest. As a general rule, the courts \"lean against\r\nforfeitures\" of this kind; and are astute to defeat the claim of the\r\nsuperior landlord or other person seeking to enforce them. By\r\nlegislation of 1881 and 1892 there is jurisdiction to grant relief upon\r\nterms against the forfeiture of a lease for breach of certain classes of\r\ncovenant, e.g. to pay rent or to insure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGERY (derived through the French from Latin _fabricare_, to\r\nconstruct), in English law, \"the fraudulent making or alteration of a\r\nwriting to the prejudice of another man's right,\" or \"the false making,\r\nor making _malo animo_, of any written instrument for the purpose of\r\nfraud or deceit.\" This definition, it will be seen, comprehends all\r\nfraudulent tampering with documents. \"Not only the fabrication and false\r\nmaking of the whole of a written instrument, but a fraudulent insertion,\r\nalteration or erasure, even of a letter, in any material part of a true\r\ninstrument whereby a new operation is given to it, will amount to\r\nforgery,--and this though it be afterwards executed by another person\r\nignorant of the deceit\" (Russell on _Crimes and Misdemeanours_, vol.\r\nii.). Changing the word Dale into Sale in a lease, so that it appears to\r\nbe a lease of the manor of Sale instead of the manor of Dale, is a\r\nforgery. And when a country banker's note was made payable at the house\r\nof a banker in London who failed, it was held to be forgery to alter the\r\nname of such London banker to that of another London banker with whom\r\nthe country banker had subsequently made his notes payable. As to the\r\nfraud, \"an intent to defraud is presumed to exist if it appears that at\r\nthe time when the false document was made there was in existence a\r\nspecific person, ascertained or unascertained, capable of being\r\ndefrauded thereby; and this presumption is not rebutted by proof that\r\nthe offender took or intended to take measures to prevent such person\r\nfrom being defrauded in fact, nor by the fact that he had or thought he\r\nhad a right to the thing to be obtained by the false document\"\r\n(Stephen's _Digest of the Criminal Law_). Thus when a man makes a false\r\nacceptance to a bill of exchange, and circulates it, intending to take\r\nit up and actually taking it up before it is presented for payment, he\r\nis guilty of forgery. Even if it be proved as a matter of fact that no\r\nperson could be defrauded (as when A forges a cheque in B's name on a\r\nbank from which B had withdrawn his account), the intent to defraud will\r\nbe presumed. But it would appear that if A knew that B had withdrawn his\r\naccount, the absence of fraudulent intention would be inferred. A\r\ngeneral intention to cheat the public is not the kind of fraud necessary\r\nto constitute forgery. Thus if a quack forges a diploma of the college\r\nof surgeons, in order to make people believe that he is a member of that\r\nbody, he is not guilty of forgery.\r\n\r\nThe crime of forgery in English law has been from time to time dealt\r\nwith in an enormous number of statutes. It was first made a statutory\r\noffence in 1562, and was punishable by fine, by standing in the pillory,\r\nhaving both ears cut off, the nostrils slit up and seared, the\r\nforfeiture of land and perpetual imprisonment. It was made capital,\r\nwithout benefit of clergy in 1634. The most notable cases of those who\r\nhave suffered the extreme penalty of the law are those of the Rev. Dr W.\r\nDodd in 1777, for forging Lord Chesterfield's name on a bond, and Henry\r\nFauntleroy, a partner in the banking-house of Marsh, Sibbald & Co., for\r\nthe appropriation by means of forged instruments of money entrusted to\r\nthe bank, in 1824. \"Anthony Hammond, in the title Forgery of his\r\n_Criminal Code_, has enumerated more than 400 statutes which contain\r\nprovisions against the offence\" (Sir J.T. Coleridge's notes to\r\nBlackstone). Blackstone notices the increasing severity of the\r\nlegislature against forgery, and says that \"through the number of these\r\ngeneral and special provisions there is now hardly a case possible to be\r\nconceived wherein forgery that tends to defraud, whether in the name of\r\na real or fictitious person, is not made a capital crime.\" These acts\r\nwere consolidated in 1830. The later statutes, fixing penalties from\r\npenal servitude for life downwards, were consolidated by the Forgery Act\r\n1861. It would take too much space to enumerate all the varieties of the\r\noffence with their appropriate punishments. The following condensed\r\nsummary is based upon chapter xlv. of Sir J. Stephen's _Digest of the\r\nCriminal Law_:\r\n\r\n  1. Forgeries punishable with penal servitude for life as a maximum\r\n  are--\r\n\r\n  (a) Forgeries of the great seal, privy seal, &c.\r\n\r\n  (b) Forgeries of transfers of stock, India bonds, exchequer bills,\r\n  bank-notes, deeds, wills, bills of exchange, &c.\r\n\r\n  (c) Obliterations or alterations of crossing on a cheque.\r\n\r\n  (d) Forgeries of registers of birth, &c., or of copies thereof and\r\n  others.\r\n\r\n  2. Forgeries punishable with fourteen years' penal servitude are--\r\n\r\n  (a) Forgeries of debentures.\r\n\r\n  (b) Forgeries of documents relating to the registering of deeds, &c.\r\n\r\n  (c) Forgeries of instruments purporting to be made by the accountant\r\n  general and other officers of the court of chancery, &c.\r\n\r\n  (d) Drawing bill of exchange, &c., on account of another, per\r\n  procuration or otherwise, without authority.\r\n\r\n  (e) Obtaining property by means of a forged instrument, knowing it to\r\n  be forged, or by probate obtained on a forged will, false oath, &c.\r\n\r\n  3. Forgeries punishable with seven years' penal servitude:--Forgeries\r\n  of seals of courts, of the process of courts, of certificates, and of\r\n  documents to be used in evidence, &c.\r\n\r\nBy the Merchandise Marks Acts 1887 and 1891, forgery of trade marks is\r\nan offence punishable on conviction by indictment with imprisonment not\r\nexceeding two years or to fine, or both, and on conviction by summary\r\nproceedings with imprisonment not exceeding four months or with a fine.\r\n\r\nThe Forged Transfers Act 1891, made retrospective by the Forged\r\nTransfers Act 1892, enables companies and local authorities to make\r\ncompensation by a cash payment out of their funds for any loss arising\r\nfrom a transfer of their stocks, shares or securities through a forged\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\n_United States._--Forgery is made a crime by statute in most if not all\r\nthe states, in addition to being a common law cheat. These statutes have\r\nmuch enlarged the common definition of this crime. It is also made a\r\ncrime by a Federal statute (U.S. Rev. Stat., ch. 5), which includes\r\nforgery of national banknotes, letters patent, public bid, record,\r\nsignature of a judge, land warrants, powers of attorney, ships' papers\r\nor custom-house documents, certificates of naturalization, &c.; the\r\npunishment is by fine or by imprisonment from one to fifteen years with\r\nor without hard labour.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois, fraudulently connecting together different parts of several\r\nbanknotes or other genuine instruments so as to produce one additional\r\nnote or instrument with intent to pass all as genuine, is a forgery of\r\neach of them (Rev. Stats. 1901, ch. 38, S 108). The alleged instrument\r\nmust be apparently capable of defrauding (_Goodman_ v. _People_ [1907],\r\n228, Ill. 154).\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, forgery of any note, certificate or bill of credit\r\nissued by the state treasurer and receiver general, or by any other\r\nofficer, for a debt of that commonwealth, or a bank bill of any bank, is\r\npunishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years (Rev. Laws\r\n1902, ch. 209, SS 4 and 5).\r\n\r\nIn New York, forgery includes the false making, counterfeiting,\r\nalteration, erasure or obliteration of a genuine instrument (Penal Code,\r\nS 520). An officer or agent of a corporation who with intent to defraud\r\nsells, pledges or issues a fraudulent scrip, share certificate, is\r\nguilty of forgery in third degree. Falsely making any instrument which\r\npurports to be issued by a corporation bearing a pretended signature of\r\na person falsely indicated as an officer of the company, is forgery just\r\nas if such person were in truth such officer (id. S 519). Counterfeiting\r\nrailroad tickets is forgery in the third degree. Falsely certifying that\r\nthe execution of a deed has been acknowledged is forgery (id. S 511). So\r\nalso is the forging a fictitious name (_People_ v. _Browne_ [1907], 103\r\nN.Y. suppl. 903). Punishment for forgery in the first degree may be\r\ntwenty years, in the second degree ten years, in the third degree five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, fraudulently making, signing, altering, uttering or\r\npublishing any written instrument other than bank bills, cheques or\r\ndrafts, was punishable by fine and imprisonment \"by separate or\r\nsolitary confinement at labour for a term not exceeding ten years\" (L.\r\n1860, March 31); forging bank bills, &c., for a term not exceeding five\r\nyears. Defacing, removing, or counterfeiting brands from lumber floating\r\nin any river is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two\r\nyears or a fine (L. 1887, May 23). Fraudulently using the registered\r\nmark of another on lumber is punishable by fine or imprisonment by\r\nsolitary confinement for a term not exceeding three years (id.).\r\n\r\nIn Tennessee, forgery may be committed by typewriting the body of and\r\nsignature to an instrument which may be the subject of forgery (1906;\r\n_State_ v. _Bradley_, 116 Tenn. 711).\r\n\r\nIn Vermont, the act of 1904, p. 135, no. 115, S 24, authorizes licensees\r\nto sell intoxicating liquors only on the written prescription of a\r\nlegally qualified physician stating that it \"is given and necessary for\r\nmedicinal use.\" It was held that a prescription containing no such\r\nstatement was invalid and the alteration thereof was not forgery (1906;\r\n_State_ v. _McManus_, 78 St. 433).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_; Stephen,\r\n  _Digest of Criminal Law_; _History of Criminal Law_; L.O.

The\r\ngenus is represented in Europe, north Asia, North America and Australia,\r\nand is characterized by oblong or linear stem-leaves, flowers in\r\nterminal scorpioid cymes, small blue, pink or white flowers, a\r\nfive-cleft persistent calyx, a salver- or funnel-shaped corolla, having\r\nits mouth closed by five short scales and hard, smooth, shining nutlets.\r\nThe common or true forget-me-not, _M. palustris_, is a perennial plant\r\ngrowing to a height of 6 to 18 in., with rootstock creeping, stem\r\nclothed with lax spreading hairs, leaves light green, and somewhat\r\nshining, buds pink, becoming blue as they expand, and corolla rotate,\r\nbroad, with retuse lobes and bright blue with a yellow centre. The\r\ndivisions of the calyx extend only about one-third the length of the\r\ncorolla, whereas in the other British species of _Myosotis_ it is deeply\r\ncleft. The forget-me-not, a favourite with poets, and the symbol of\r\nconstancy, is a frequent ornament of brooks, rivers and ditches, and,\r\naccording to an old German tradition, received its name from the last\r\nwords of a knight who was drowned in the attempt to procure the flower\r\nfor his lady. It attains its greatest perfection under cultivation, and,\r\nas it flowers throughout the summer, is used with good effect for garden\r\nborders; a variety, _M. strigulosa_, is more hairy and erect, and its\r\nflowers are smaller. In _M. versicolor_ the flowers are yellow when\r\nfirst open and change generally to a dull blue; sometimes they are\r\npermanently yellowish-white. Of the species in cultivation, _M.\r\ndissitiflora_, 6 to 8 in., with large handsome abundant sky-blue\r\nflowers, is the best and earliest, flowering from February onwards; it\r\ndoes well in light cool soils, preferring peaty ones, and should be\r\nrenewed annually from seeds or cuttings. _M. rupicola_, or _M.\r\nalpestris_, 2 to 3 in., intense blue, is a fine rock plant, preferring\r\nshady situations and gritty soil; _M. azorica_ (a native of the Azores)\r\nwith purple, ultimately blue flowers about half an inch across, has a\r\nsimilar habit but larger flowers; _M. sylvatica_, 1 ft., blue, pink or\r\nwhite, used for spring bedding, should be sown annually in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGING, the craft of the smith, or \"blacksmith,\" exercised on malleable\r\niron and steel, in the production of works of constructive utility and\r\nof ornament. It differs from founding (q.v.) in the fact that the metal\r\nis never melted. It is essentially a moulding process, the iron or steel\r\nbeing worked at a full red, or white, heat when it is in a plastic and\r\nmore or less pasty condition. Consequently the tools used are in the\r\nmain counterparts of the shapes desired, and they mould by impact. All\r\nthe operations of forging may be reduced to a few very simple ones: (1)\r\nReducing or drawing down from a larger to a smaller section (\"fullering\"\r\nand \"swaging\"); (2) enlargement of a smaller to a larger portion\r\n(\"upsetting\"); (3) bending, or turning round to any angle of curvature;\r\n(4) uniting one piece of metal to another (\"welding\"); (5) the formation\r\nof holes by punching; and (6) severance, or cutting off. These include\r\nall the operations that are done at the anvil. In none of these\r\nprocesses, the last excepted, is the use of a sharp cutting tool\r\ninvolved, and therefore there is no violence done to the fibre of the\r\nmalleable metal. Nor have the tools of the smith any sharp edges, except\r\nthe cutting-off tools or \"setts.\" The essential fact of the flow of the\r\nmetal, which is viscous when at a full red heat, must never be lost\r\nsight of; and in forging wrought iron the judgment of the smith must be\r\nexercised in arranging the direction of the fibre in a way best\r\ncalculated to secure maximum strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fullering and swaging.\r\n\r\n  Fullering denotes the preliminary roughing-down of the material\r\n  between tools having convex edges; swaging, the completion or\r\n  finishing process between swages, or dies of definite shape, nearly\r\n  hemispherical in form. When a bar has to be reduced from larger to\r\n  smaller dimensions, it is laid upon a fuller or round-faced stake, set\r\n  in the anvil, or, in some cases, on a flat face (fig. 1), and blows\r\n  are dealt upon that portion of the face which lies exactly opposite\r\n  with a fullering tool A, grasped by a rather loosely-fitting handle\r\n  and struck on its head by a sledge. The position of the piece of work\r\n  is quickly changed at brief intervals in order to bring successive\r\n  portions under the action of the swages until the reduction is\r\n  completed; the upper face, and if a bottom fuller is used the under\r\n  face also, is thus left corrugated slightly. These corrugations are\r\n  then removed either by a flatter, if the surfaces are plane (fig. 2),\r\n  or by hollow swages, if the cross section is circular (fig. 3). Spring\r\n  swages (fig. 4) are frequently used instead of separate \"top and\r\n  bottom tools.\" Frequently swaging is practised at once, without the\r\n  preliminary detail of fullering. It is adopted when the amount of\r\n  reduction is slight, and also when a steam hammer or other type of\r\n  power hammer is available. This process of drawing down or fullering\r\n  is, when practicable, adopted in preference to either upsetting or\r\n  welding, because it is open to no objection, and involves no risk of\r\n  damage to the material, while it improves the metal by consolidating\r\n  its fibres. But its limitations in anvil work lie in the tediousness\r\n  of the operation, when the part to be reduced is very much less in\r\n  diameter, and very much longer, than the original piece of bar. Then\r\n  there are other alternatives.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upsetting.\r\n\r\n  If a long bar is required to have an enlargement at any portion of its\r\n  length, not very much larger in diameter than the bar, nor of great\r\n  length, upsetting is the method adopted. The part to be enlarged is\r\n  heated, the parts adjacent remaining cold, and an end is hammered, or\r\n  else lifted and dropped heavily on the anvil or on an iron plate, with\r\n  the result that the heated portion becomes both shortened and enlarged\r\n  (figs. 5 and 6). This process is only suitable for relatively short\r\n  lengths, and has the disadvantage that the fibres of wrought iron are\r\n  liable to open, and so cause weakening of the upset portion. But\r\n  steel, which has no direction of fibre, can be upset without injury;\r\n  this method is therefore commonly adopted in steel work, in power\r\n  presses to an equal extent with drawing down. The alternative to\r\n  upsetting is generally to weld a larger to a smaller bar or section,\r\n  or to encircle the bar with a ring and weld the two (fig. 7), and then\r\n  to impart any shape desired to the ring in swages.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bending.\r\n\r\n  Bending is effected either by the hammer or by the simple exercise of\r\n  leverage, the heated bar being pulled round a fulcrum. It is always,\r\n  when practicable, preferable to cutting out a curved or angular shape\r\n  with a hot sett or to welding. The continuity of the fibre in iron is\r\n  preserved by bending, and the risk of an imperfect weld is avoided.\r\n  Hence it is a simple and safe process which is constantly being\r\n  performed at the anvil. An objection to sharp bends, or those having a\r\n  small radius, is that the fibres become extended on the outer radius,\r\n  the cross section being at the same time reduced below that of the bar\r\n  itself. This is met by imparting a preliminary amount of upsetting to\r\n  the part to be bent, sufficient to counteract the amount of reduction\r\n  due to extension of the fibres. A familiar example is seen in the\r\n  corners of dip cranks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Welding.\r\n\r\n  The property possessed by pieces of iron or steel of uniting\r\n  autogeneously while in a condition of semi-fusion is very valuable.\r\n  When portions which differ greatly in dimensions have to be united,\r\n  welding is the only method practicable at the anvil. It is also\r\n  generally the best to adopt when union has to be made between pieces\r\n  at right angles, or when a piece on which much work has to be done is\r\n  required at the end of a long plain bar, as in the tension rods of\r\n  cranes and other structures with eyes. The art of welding depends\r\n  chiefly on having perfectly clean joint faces, free from scale, so\r\n  that metal can unite to metal; union would be prevented by the\r\n  presence of oxide or of dirt. Also it is essential to have a\r\n  temperature sufficiently high, yet not such as to overheat the metal.\r\n  A dazzling white, at which small particles of metal begin to drop off,\r\n  is suitable for iron, but steel must not be made so hot. A very few\r\n  hammer blows suffice to effect the actual union; if the joint be\r\n  faulty, no amount of subsequent hammering will weld it. The forms of\r\n  weld-joints include the scarf (figs. 8 and 9), the butt (fig. 10), the\r\n  V (fig. 11) and the glut, one form of which is shown in fig. 12; the\r\n  illustrations are of bars prepared for welding. These forms give the\r\n  smith a suitable choice for different conditions. A convexity is\r\n  imparted to the joint faces in order to favour the expulsion of slag\r\n  and dirt during the closing of the joint; these undesirable matters\r\n  become entangled between concave faces. The ends are upset or enlarged\r\n  in order to leave enough metal to be dressed down flush, by swaging or\r\n  by flattering. The proportional lengths of the joint faces shown are\r\n  those which conform to good practice. The fluxes used for welding are\r\n  numerous. Sand alone is generally dusted on wrought iron, but steel\r\n  requires borax applied on the joint while in the fire, and also dusted\r\n  on the joint at the anvil and on the face of the latter itself.\r\n  Electric welding is largely taking the place of the hand process, but\r\n  machines are required to maintain the parts in contact during the\r\n  passage of the current. Butt joints are employed, and a large quantity\r\n  of power is absorbed, but the output is immensely greater than that of\r\n  hand-made welds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Punching.\r\n\r\n  When holes are not very large they are formed by punching, but large\r\n  holes are preferably produced by bending a rod round and welding it,\r\n  so forming an eye (fig. 13). Small holes are often punched simply as a\r\n  preliminary stage in the formation of a larger hole by a process of\r\n  drifting. A piece of work to be punched is supported either on the\r\n  anvil or on a ring of metal termed a bolster, laid on the anvil,\r\n  through which the burr, when severed, falls. But in making small holes\r\n  through a thick mass, no burr is produced, the metal yielding sideways\r\n  and forming an enlargement or boss. Examples occur in the wrought iron\r\n  stanchions that carry light hand railing. In such cases the hole has\r\n  to be punched from each face, meeting in the centre. Punching under\r\n  power hammers is done similarly, but occupies less time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cutting-off.\r\n\r\n  The cutting-off or severance of material is done either on hot or cold\r\n  metal. In the first case the chisels used, \"hot setts,\" have keener\r\n  cutting angles than those employed for the second, termed \"cold\r\n  setts.\" One sett is held in a hole in the anvil face, the \"anvil\r\n  chisel,\" the other is handled and struck with a sledge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe difference between iron and steel at the forge is that iron\r\npossesses a very marked fibre whereas steel does not. Many forgings\r\ntherefore must be made differently according as they are in iron or in\r\nsteel. In the first the fibre must never be allowed to run transversely\r\nto the axis of greatest tensile or bending stress, but must be in line\r\ntherewith. For this reason many forgings, of which a common eye or loop\r\n(fig. 13) is a typical example, that would be stamped from a solid piece\r\nif made in steel, must be bent round from bar and welded if in wrought\r\niron. Further, welding which is practically uniformly trustworthy in\r\nwrought iron, is distrusted in steel. The difference is due to the very\r\nfibrous character of iron, the welding of which gives much less anxiety\r\nto the smith than that of steel. Welds in iron are frequently made\r\nwithout any flux, those in steel never. Though mention has only been\r\nmade of iron and steel, other alloys are forged, as those of aluminium,\r\ndelta metal, &c. But the essential operations are alike, the differences\r\nbeing in temperature at which the forging is done and nature of the\r\nfluxes used for welding. For hardening and tempering, an important\r\nsection of smith's work, see ANNEALING.\r\n\r\n_Die Forging._--The smith operating by hand uses the above methods only.\r\nThere is, however, a large and increasing volume of forgings produced in\r\nother ways, and comprehended under the general terms, \"die forging\" or\r\n\"drop forging.\"\r\n\r\nLittle proof is needed to show that the various operations done at the\r\nanvil might be performed in a more expeditious way by the aid of\r\npower-operated appliances; for the elementary processes of reducing, and\r\nenlarging, bending, punching, &c., are extremely simple, and the most\r\nelaborate forged work involves only a repetition of these. The fact that\r\nthe material used is entirely plastic when raised to a white heat is\r\nmost favourable to the method of forging in matrices or dies. A white\r\nhot mass of metal can be placed in a matrix, and stamped into shape in a\r\nfew blows under a hammer with as much ease as a medal can be stamped in\r\nsteel dies under a coining press. But much detail is involved in the\r\ntranslation of the principle into practice. The parallel between coining\r\ndies and forging dies does not go far. The blank for the coin is\r\nprepared to such exact dimensions that no surplus material is left over\r\nby the striking of the coin, which is struck while cold. But the blank\r\nused in die forging is generally a shapeless piece, taken without any\r\npreliminary preparation, a mere lump, a piece of bar or rod, which may\r\nbe square or round irrespective of whether the ultimate forging is to be\r\nsquare, or round, or flat or a combination of forms. At the verge of the\r\nwelding heat to which it is raised, and under the intensity of the\r\nimpact of hammer blows rained rapidly on the upper die, the metal yields\r\nlike lead, and flows and fills the dies.\r\n\r\nHerein lies a difference between striking a coin and moulding a forging.\r\nA large amount of metal is squeezed out beyond the concavity of the\r\nforging dies, and this would, if allowed to flow over between the\r\njoints, prevent the dies from being closed on the forging. There are two\r\nmethods adopted for removing this \"fin,\" or \"flash\" as it is termed, one\r\nbeing that of suppression, applicable to circular work, the other that\r\nof stripping, applied to almost all other cases.\r\n\r\n  The suppression of fin means that the circular bar is rotated in the\r\n  dies (fig. 14) through a small arc, alternating between every few\r\n  blows, with the result that the fin is obliterated immediately when\r\n  formed, this being done at the same time that reduction of section is\r\n  being effected over a portion or the whole of the bar.\r\n\r\n  Stripping means that when a considerable amount of fin has been\r\n  formed, it is removed by laying the forging on a die pierced right\r\n  through with an opening of the same shape and area as the forging, and\r\n  then dealing the forging a blow with the hammer. The forging is thus\r\n  knocked through the die, leaving the severed or stripped fin behind.\r\n  The forging is then returned to the dies and again treated, and the\r\n  stripping may be repeated twice, or even oftener, before the forging\r\n  can be completed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n  Figs. 15 and 16 illustrate the bottom dies of a set for forging in a\r\n  particular form of eye, the top dies being of exactly the same shape.\r\n  The first operation takes place in fig. 15, in which a bar of metal is\r\n  reduced to a globular and cylindrical form, being constantly rotated\r\n  meanwhile. The shank portion is then drawn down in the parallel recess\r\n  to the left. The shape of the eye is completed in fig. 16, and the\r\n  shank in the recess to the left of that. Fig. 17 shows how a lever is\r\n  stamped between top and bottom dies. The hole in the larger boss is\r\n  formed by punching, the punches nearly meeting in the centre, and the\r\n  centre for the hole to be drilled subsequently in the smaller boss is\r\n  located by a conical projection in the top die.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n  It is evident that the methods of die forging, though only explained\r\n  here in barest outline, constitute a principle of extensive\r\n  application.\r\n\r\n  An intricate or ornamental forging, which might occupy a smith a\r\n  quarter of a day in making at the anvil, can often be produced in dies\r\n  within five minutes (fig. 18). On the other hand, there is the cost of\r\n  the preparation of the dies, which is often heavy, so that the\r\n  question of method is resolved into the relative one of the cost of\r\n  dies, distributed over the number of identical forgings required. From\r\n  this point of view it is clear that given say a thousand forgings,\r\n  ordered all alike, the cost of even expensive dies distributed over\r\n  the whole becomes only an infinitesimal amount per forging.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n  There is, further, the very important fact that forgings which are\r\n  produced in dies are uniform and generally of more exact dimensions\r\n  than anvil-made articles. This is seen to be an advantage when\r\n  forgings have to be turned or otherwise tooled in the engineer's\r\n  machine shop, since it lessens the amount of work required there.\r\n  Besides, for many purposes such forgings do not require tooling at\r\n  all, or only superficial grinding, while anvil-made ones would, in\r\n  consequence of their slight inaccuracies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n  Yet again, die forging is a very elastic system, and herein lies much\r\n  of its value. Though it reaches its highest development when thousands\r\n  of similar pieces are wanted, it is also adaptable to a hundred, or\r\n  even to a dozen, similar forgings. In such cases economy is secured by\r\n  using dies of a very cheap character; or, by employing such dies as\r\n  supplementary to anvil work for effecting neat finish to more precise\r\n  dimensions than can be ensured at the anvil. In the first case use is\r\n  made of dies of cast iron moulded from patterns (fig. 19) instead of\r\n  having their matrices laboriously cut in steel with drills, chisels\r\n  and milling tools. In the second, preliminary drawing down is done\r\n  under the steam hammer, and bending and welding at the anvil, or under\r\n  the steam hammer, until the forgings are brought approximately to\r\n  their final shape and dimensions. Then they are reheated and inserted\r\n  in the dies, when a few blows under the steam or drop hammer suffice\r\n  to impart a neat and accurate finish.\r\n\r\n  The limitations of die forging are chiefly those due to large\r\n  dimensions. The system is most successful for the smallest forgings\r\n  and dies which can be handled by one man without the assistance of\r\n  cranes; and massive forgings are not required in such large numbers as\r\n  are those of small dimensions. But there are many large articles\r\n  manufactured which do not strictly come under the term forgings, in\r\n  which the aid of dies actuated by powerful hydraulic presses is\r\n  utilized. These include work that is bent, drawn and shaped from steel\r\n  plate, of which the fittings of railway wagons constitute by far the\r\n  largest proportion. The dies used for some of these are massive, and a\r\n  single squeeze from the ram of the hydraulic press employed bends the\r\n  steel plate between the dies to shape at once. Fairly massive forgings\r\n  are also produced in these presses.\r\n\r\n  Die forging in its highest developments invades the craft of the\r\n  skilled smith. In shops where it is adopted entirely, the only\r\n  craftsmen required are the few who have general charge of the shops.\r\n  The men who attend to the machines are not smiths, but unskilled\r\n  helpers.     (J. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORK (Lat. _furca_), an implement formed of two or more prongs at the\r\nend of a shaft or handle, the most familiar type of which is the\r\ntable-fork for use in eating. In agriculture and horticulture the fork\r\nis used for pitching hay, and other green crops, manure, &c.; commonly\r\nthis has two prongs, \"tines\"; for digging, breaking up surface soil,\r\npreparing for hand weeding and for planting the three-pronged fork is\r\nused. The word is also applied to many objects which are characterized\r\nby branching ends, as the tuning-fork, with two branching metal prongs,\r\nwhich on being struck vibrates and gives a musical note, used to give a\r\nstandard of pitch; to the branching into two streams of a river, or the\r\njunction where a tributary runs into the main river; and in the human\r\nbody, to that part where the legs branch off from the trunk.\r\n\r\nThe _furca_, two pieces of wood fastened together in the form of the\r\nletter [Lambda], was used by the Romans as an instrument of punishment.\r\nIt was placed over the shoulders of the criminal, and his hands were\r\nfastened to it, condemned slaves were compelled to carry it about with\r\nthem, and those sentenced to be flogged would be tied to it;\r\ncrucifixions were sometimes carried out on a similar shaped instrument.\r\nFrom the great defeat of the Romans by the Samnites at the battle of the\r\nCaudine Forks (_Furculae Caudinae_), a narrow gorge, where the\r\nvanquished were compelled to pass under the yoke (_jugum_), as a sign of\r\nsubmission, the expression \"to pass through or under the forks\" has been\r\nloosely used of such a disgraceful surrender. The \"forks\" in any\r\nallusion to this defeat should refer to the topographical name and not\r\nto the _jugum_, which consisted of two upright spears with a third\r\nplaced transversely as a cross-bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORKEL, JOHANN NIKOLAUS (1749-1818), German musician, was born on the\r\n22nd of February 1749 at Meeder in Coburg. He was the son of a cobbler,\r\nand as a practical musician, especially as a pianoforte player, achieved\r\nsome eminence; but his claims to a more abiding name rest chiefly upon\r\nhis literary skill and deep research as an historian of musical science\r\nand literature. He was an enthusiastic admirer of J.S. Bach, whose music\r\nhe did much to popularize. His library, which was accumulated with care\r\nand discrimination at a time when rare books were cheap, forms a\r\nvaluable portion of the royal library in Berlin and also of the library\r\nof the Koniglicher Institut fur Kirchenmusik. He was organist to the\r\nuniversity church of Gottingen, obtained the degree of doctor of\r\nphilosophy, and in 1778 became musical director of the university. He\r\ndied at Gottingen on the 20th of March 1818. The following is a list of\r\nhis principal works: _Uber die Theorie der Musik_ (Gottingen, 1777);\r\n_Musikalisch kritische Bibliothek_ (Gotha, 1778); _Allgemeine Geschichte\r\nder Musik_ (Leipzig, 1788). The last is his most important work. He also\r\nwrote a _Dictionary of Musical Literature_, which is full of valuable\r\nmaterial. To his musical compositions, which are numerous, little\r\ninterest is to-day to be attached. But it is worth noting that he wrote\r\nvariations on the English national anthem \"God save the king\" for the\r\nclavichord, and that Abt Vogler wrote a sharp criticism on them, which\r\nappeared at Frankfort in 1793 together with a set of variations as he\r\nconceived they ought to be written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORLI (anc. _Forum Livii_), a town and episcopal see of Emilia, Italy,\r\nthe capital of the province of Forli, 40 m. S.E. of Bologna by rail, 108\r\nft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 15,461 (town); 43,321 (commune). Forli\r\nis situated on the railway between Bologna and Rimini. It is connected\r\nby steam tramways with Ravenna and Meldola, and by a road through the\r\nApennines with Pontassieve. The church of S. Mercuriale stands in the\r\nprincipal square, and contains, besides paintings, some good carved and\r\ninlaid choir stalls by Alessandro dei Bigni. The facade has been\r\nconsiderably altered, but the campanile, erected in 1178-1180, still\r\nexists; it is 252 ft. in height, square and built of brickwork, and is\r\none of the finest of Lombard campanili. The pictures in this church are\r\nthe work of Marco Palmezzano (1456-1537) and others; S. Biagio and the\r\nmunicipal picture gallery also contain works by him. The latter has\r\nother interesting pictures, including a fresco representing an\r\napprentice with pestle and mortar (Pestapepe), the only authentic work\r\nin Forli of Melozzo da Forli (1438-1494), an eminent master whose style\r\nwas formed under the influence of Piero della Francesca, and who was the\r\nmaster of Palmezzano; the frescoes in the Sforza chapel in SS. Biagio e\r\nGirolamo are from the former's designs, though executed by the latter.\r\nThe church also contains the fine tomb (1466) of Barbara Manfredi. The\r\ncathedral (Santa Croce) has been almost entirely rebuilt since 1844. The\r\nPalazzo del Podesta, now a private house, is a brick building of the\r\n15th century. The citadel (Rocca Ravaldina), constructed about\r\n1360-1370, and later rebuilt, is now used as a prison. Flavio Biondo,\r\nthe first Renaissance writer on the topography of ancient Rome\r\n(1388-1463), was a native of Forli.\r\n\r\nOf the ancient Forum Livii, which lay on the Via Aemilia, hardly\r\nanything is known. In the 12th century we find Forli in league with\r\nRavenna, and in the 13th the imperial count of the province of Romagna\r\nresided there. In 1275 Forli defeated Bologna with great loss. Martin\r\nIV. sent an army to besiege it in 1282, which was driven out after\r\nsevere fighting in the streets; but the town soon afterwards\r\nsurrendered. In the 14th and 15th centuries it was under the government\r\nof the Ordelaffi; and in 1500 was taken by Caesar Borgia, despite a\r\ndetermined resistance by Caterina Sforza, widow of Girolamo Riario.\r\nForli finally became a part of the papal state in 1504. (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORLIMPOPOLI (anc. _Forum Popillii_), a village of Emilia, Italy, in the\r\nprovince of Forli, from which it is 5 m. S.E. by rail, 105 ft. above\r\nsea-level. Pop. (1901) 2299 (town); 5795 (commune). The ancient Forum\r\nPopillii, a station on the Via Aemilia, was destroyed by Grimuald in\r\n672. Whether its site is occupied by the present town is not certain;\r\nthe former should perhaps be sought a mile or so farther to the S.E.,\r\nwhere were found most of the inscriptions of which the place of\r\ndiscovery is certain. Forlimpopoli was again destroyed by Cardinal\r\nAlbornoz in 1360, and rebuilt by Sinibaldo Ordelaffi, who constructed\r\nthe well-preserved medieval castle (1380), rectangular with four\r\ncircular towers at the corners.     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORLORN HOPE (through Dutch _verloren hoop_, from Ger. _verlorene Haufe_\r\n= \"lost troop\"; _Haufe_, \"heap,\" being equivalent in the 17th century to\r\n\"body of troops\"; the French equivalent is _enfants perdus_), a\r\nmilitary term (sometimes shortened to \"forlorn\"), used in the 16th and\r\n17th centuries for a body of troops thrown out in front of the line of\r\nbattle to engage the hostile line, somewhat after the fashion of\r\nskirmishers, though they were always solid closed bodies. These troops\r\nran great risks, because they were often trapped between the two lines\r\nof battle as the latter closed upon one another, and fired upon or\r\nridden down by their friends; further, their mission was to facilitate\r\nthe attacks of their own main body by striking the first blow against or\r\nmeeting the first shock of the fresh and unshaken enemy. In the\r\nfollowing century (18th), when lines of masses were no longer employed,\r\na thin line of skirmishers alone preceded the three-deep line of battle,\r\nbut the term \"forlorn hope\" continued to be used for picked bodies of\r\nmen entrusted with dangerous tasks, and in particular for the storming\r\nparty at the assault of a fortress. In this last sense \"forlorn hope\" is\r\noften used at the present time. The misunderstanding of the word \"hope\"\r\nhas led to various applications of \"forlorn hope,\" such as to an\r\nenterprise offering little chance of success, or, further still from the\r\noriginal meaning, to the faint or desperate hope of such success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM (Lat. _forma_), in general, the external shape, appearance,\r\nconfiguration of an object, in contradistinction to the matter of which\r\nit is composed; thus a speech may contain excellent arguments,--the\r\n_matter_ may be good, while the style, grammar, arrangement,--the\r\n_form_--is bad. The term, with its adjective \"formal\" and the derived\r\nnouns \"formality\" and \"formalism,\" is hence contemptuously used for that\r\nwhich is superficial, unessential, hypocritical: chap. xxiii. of\r\nMatthew's gospel is a classical instance of the distinction between the\r\nformalism of the Pharisaic code and genuine religion. With this may be\r\ncompared the popular phrases \"good form\" and \"bad form\" applied to\r\nbehaviour in society: so \"format\" (from the French) is technically used\r\nof the shape and size, e.g. of a book (octavo, quarto, &c.) or of a\r\ncigarette. The word \"form\" is also applied to certain definite objects:\r\nin printing a body of type secured in a chase for printing at one\r\nimpression (\"form\" or \"forme\"); a bench without a back, such as is used\r\nin schools (perhaps to be compared with O. Fr. _s'asseoir en forme_, to\r\nsit in a row); a mould or shape on or in which an object is\r\nmanufactured; the lair or nest of a hare. From its use in the sense of\r\nregulated order comes the application of the term to a class in a school\r\n(\"sixth form,\" \"fifth form,\" &c.); this sense has been explained without\r\nsufficient ground as due to the idea of all children in the same class\r\nsitting on a single form (bench).\r\n\r\nThe word has been used technically in philosophy with various shades of\r\nmeaning. Thus it is used to translate the Platonic [Greek: idea],\r\n[Greek: eidos], the permanent reality which makes a thing what it is, in\r\ncontrast with the particulars which are finite and subject to change.\r\nWhether Plato understood these forms as actually existent apart from all\r\nthe particular examples, or as being of the nature of immutable physical\r\nlaws, is matter of discussion. For practical purposes Aristotle was the\r\nfirst to distinguish between matter ([Greek: hyle]) and form ([Greek:\r\neidos]). To Aristotle matter is the undifferentiated primal element: it\r\nis rather that from which things develop ([Greek: hypokeimenon], [Greek:\r\ndynamis]) than a thing in itself ([Greek: energeia]). The development of\r\nparticular things from this germinal matter consists in differentiation,\r\nthe acquiring of particular _forms_ of which the knowable universe\r\nconsists (cf. CAUSATION for the Aristotelian \"formal cause\"). The\r\nperfection of the form of a thing is its entelechy ([Greek:\r\nentelecheia]) in virtue of which it attains its fullest realization of\r\nfunction (_De anima_, ii. 2, [Greek: he men hyle dynamis to de eidos\r\nentelecheia]). Thus the entelechy of the body is the soul. The origin of\r\nthe differentiation process is to be sought in a \"prime mover\" ([Greek:\r\nproton kinoun]), i.e. pure form entirely separate ([Greek: choriston])\r\nfrom all matter, eternal, unchangeable, operating not by its own\r\nactivity but by the impulse which its own absolute existence excites in\r\nmatter ([Greek: hos eromenon], [Greek: ou kinoumenon]). The Aristotelian\r\nconception of form was nominally, though perhaps in most cases\r\nunintelligently, adopted by the Scholastics, to whom, however, its\r\norigin in the observation of the physical universe was an entirely\r\nforeign idea. The most remarkable adaptation is probably that of\r\nAquinas, who distinguished the spiritual world with its \"subsistent\r\nforms\" (_formae separatae_) from the material with its \"inherent forms\"\r\nwhich exist only in combination with matter. Bacon, returning to the\r\nphysical standpoint, maintained that all true research must be devoted\r\nto the discovery of the real nature or essence of things. His induction\r\nsearches for the true \"form\" of light, heat and so forth, analysing the\r\nexternal \"form\" given in perception into simpler \"forms\" and their\r\n\"differences.\" Thus he would collect all possible instances of hot\r\nthings, and discover that which is present in all, excluding all those\r\nqualities which belong accidentally to one or more of the examples\r\ninvestigated: the \"form\" of heat is the residuum common to all. Kant\r\ntransferred the term from the objective to the subjective sphere. All\r\nperception is necessarily conditioned by pure \"forms of sensibility,\"\r\ni.e. space and time: whatever is perceived is perceived as having\r\nspacial and temporal relations (see SPACE AND TIME; KANT). These forms\r\nare not obtained by abstraction from sensible data, nor are they\r\nstrictly speaking innate: they are obtained \"by the very action of the\r\nmind from the co-ordination of its sensation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMALIN, or FORMALDEHYDE, CH2O or H.CHO, the first member of the series\r\nof saturated aliphatic aldehydes. It is most readily prepared by passing\r\nthe vapour of methyl alcohol, mixed with air, over heated copper or\r\nplatinum. In order to collect the formaldehyde, the vapour is condensed\r\nand absorbed, either in water or alcohol. It may also be obtained,\r\nalthough only in small quantities, by the distillation of calcium\r\nformate. At ordinary temperatures formaldehyde is a gas possessing a\r\npungent smell; it is a strong antiseptic and disinfectant, a 40%\r\nsolution of the aldehyde in water or methyl alcohol, sold as _formalin_,\r\nbeing employed as a deodorant, fungicide and preservative. It is not\r\npossible to obtain the aldehyde in a pure condition, since it readily\r\npolymerizes. It is a strong reducing agent; it combines with ammonia to\r\nform _hexamethylene tetramine_, (CH2)6N4, and easily \"condenses\" in the\r\npresence of many bases to produce compounds which apparently belong to\r\nthe sugars (q.v.). It renders glue or gelatin insoluble in water, and is\r\nused in the coal-tar colour industry in the manufacture of\r\npara-rosaniline, pyronines and rosamines. Several polymers have been\r\ndescribed. _Para-formaldehyde_, or trioxymethylene, obtained by\r\nconcentrating solutions of formaldehyde _in vacuo_, is a white\r\ncrystalline solid, which sublimes at about 100 deg. C. and melts at a\r\nsomewhat higher temperature, changing back into the original form. It is\r\ninsoluble in cold water, alcohol and ether. A diformaldehyde is supposed\r\nto separate as white flakes when the vapour is passed into chloroform\r\n(Korber, _Pharm. Zeit._, 1904, xlix. p. 609); F. Auerbach and H.\r\nBarschall (_Chem. Zentr._, 1907, ii. p. 1734) obtained three polymers by\r\nacting with concentrated sulphuric acid on solutions of formaldehyde,\r\nand a fourth by heating one of the forms so obtained. The strength of\r\nsolutions of formaldehyde may be ascertained by the addition of excess\r\nof standard ammonia to the aldehyde solution (hexamethylene tetramine\r\nbeing formed), the excess of ammonia being then estimated by titration\r\nwith standard acid. On the formation of formaldehyde by the oxidation of\r\nmethane at high temperatures, see W.A. Bone (_Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1902,\r\n81, p. 535; 1903, 83, p. 1074). Formaldehyde also appears to be a\r\nreduction product of carbon dioxide (see _Annual Reports of the Chemical\r\nSociety_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAN, ANDREW (c. 1465-1521), Scottish ecclesiastic, was educated at\r\nthe university of St Andrews and entered the service of King James IV.\r\nabout 1489. He soon earned the favour of this king, who treated him with\r\ngreat generosity and who on several occasions sent him on important\r\nembassies to the English, the French and the papal courts. In 1501 he\r\nbecame bishop of Moray and in July 1513 Louis XII. of France secured his\r\nappointment as archbishop of Bourges, while pope Julius II. promised to\r\nmake him a cardinal. In 1514 during a long absence from his own land\r\nForman was nominated by Pope Leo X. to the vacant archbishopric of St\r\nAndrews and was made papal legate in Scotland, but it was some time\r\nbefore he secured possession of the see owing to the attempts of Henry\r\nVIII. to subject Scotland to England and to the efforts of his rivals,\r\nGavin Douglas, the poet, and John Hepburn, prior of St Andrews, and\r\ntheir supporters. Eventually, however, he resigned some of his many\r\nbenefices, the holding of which had made him unpopular, and through the\r\ngood offices of the regent, John Stewart, duke of Albany, obtained the\r\ncoveted archbishopric and the primacy of Scotland. Afterwards he was one\r\nof the vice-regents of the kingdom and he died on the 11th of March\r\n1521. As archbishop he issued a series of constitutions which are\r\nprinted in J. Robertson's _Concilia Scotiae_ (1866). Mr Andrew Lang\r\n(_History of Scotland_, vol. i.) describes Forman as \"the Wolsey of\r\nScotland, and a fomenter of the war which ended at Flodden.\"\r\n\r\n  See the biography of the archbishop which forms vol. ii. of _The\r\n  Archbishops of St Andrews_, by J. Herkless and R.K. Hannay (1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAN, SIMON (1552-1611), English physician and astrologer, was born in\r\n1552 at Quidham, a small village near Wilton, Wiltshire. At the age of\r\nfourteen he became apprentice to a druggist at Salisbury, but at the end\r\nof four years he exchanged this profession for that of a schoolmaster.\r\nShortly afterwards he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied\r\nchiefly medicine and astrology. After continuing the same studies in\r\nHolland he commenced practice as a physician in Philpot Lane, London,\r\nbut as he possessed no diploma, he on this account underwent more than\r\none term of imprisonment. Ultimately, however, he obtained a diploma\r\nfrom Cambridge university, and established himself as a physician and\r\nastrologer at Lambeth, where he was consulted, especially as a\r\nphysician, by many persons of rank, among others by the notorious\r\ncountess of Essex. He expired suddenly while crossing the Thames in a\r\nboat on the 12th of September 1611.\r\n\r\n  A list of Forman's works on astrology is given in Bliss's edition of\r\n  the _Athenae Oxonienses_; many of his MS. works are contained in the\r\n  Bodleian Library, the British Museum and the Plymouth Library. _A\r\n  Brief Description of the Forman MSS. in the Public Library, Plymouth_,\r\n  was published in 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMERET, a French architectural term for the wall-rib carrying the web\r\nor filling-in of a vault (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMEY, JOHANN HEINRICH SAMUEL (1711-1797), Franco-German author, was\r\nborn of French parentage at Berlin on the 31st of May 1711. He was\r\neducated for the ministry, and at the age of twenty became pastor of the\r\nFrench church at Brandenburg. Having in 1736 accepted the invitation of\r\na congregation in Berlin, he was in the following year chosen professor\r\nof rhetoric in the French college of that city and in 1739 professor of\r\nphilosophy. On the organization of the academy of Berlin in 1744 he was\r\nnamed a member, and in 1748 became its perpetual secretary. He died at\r\nBerlin on the 7th of March 1797. His principal works are _La Belle\r\nWolfienne_ (1741-1750, 6 vols.), a kind of novel written with the view\r\nof enforcing the precepts of the Wolfian philosophy; _Bibliotheque\r\ncritique, ou memoires pour servir a l'histoire litteraire ancienne et\r\nmoderne_ (1746); _Le Philosophe chretien_ (1750); _L'Emile chretien_\r\n(1764), intended as an answer to the _Emile_ of Rousseau; and _Souvenirs\r\nd'un citoyen_ (Berlin, 1789). He also published an immense number of\r\ncontemporary memoirs in the transactions of the Berlin Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMIA (anc. _Formiae_, called Mola di Gaeta until recent times), a town\r\nof Campania, Italy, in the province of Caserta, from which it is 48 m.\r\nW.N.W. by rail. Pop. (1901) 5514 (town); 8452 (commune). It is situated\r\nat the N.W. extremity of the Bay of Gaeta, and commands beautiful views.\r\nIt lay on the ancient Via Appia, and was much frequented as a resort by\r\nwealthy Romans. There was considerable imperial property here and along\r\nthe coast as far as Sperlonga, and there are numerous remains of ancient\r\nvillas along the coast and on the slopes above it. The so-called villa\r\nof Cicero contains two well-preserved _nymphaea_ with Doric\r\narchitecture. Its site is now occupied by the villa Caposele, once a\r\nsummer residence of the kings of Naples. There are many other modern\r\nvillas, and the sheltered hillsides (for the mountains rise abruptly\r\nbehind the town) are covered with lemon, orange and pomegranate gardens.\r\nThe now deserted promontory of the Monte Scauri to the E. is also\r\ncovered with remains of ancient villas; the hill is crowned by a large\r\ntomb, known as Torre Giano. To the E. at Scauri is a large villa with\r\nsubstructions in \"Cyclopean\" work. The ancient Formiae was, according to\r\nthe legend, the home of the Laestrygones, and later a Spartan colony\r\n([Greek: Hormiaidia to euormon], Strabo v. 3. 6, p. 233). It was a\r\nVolscian town, and, like Fundi, received the _civitas sine suffragio_\r\nfrom Rome in 338 (or 332 B.C.) because the passage through its territory\r\nhad always been secure. This was strategically important for the Romans,\r\nas the military road definitely constructed by Appius Claudius in 312\r\nB.C., still easily traceable by its remains, and in part followed by the\r\nhigh-road, traversed a narrow pass, which could easily be blocked,\r\nbetween Fundi and Formiae. In 188 B.C., with Fundi, it received the full\r\ncitizenship, and, like it, was to a certain extent under the control of\r\na _praefectus_ sent from Rome, though it retained its three aediles.\r\nMamurra was a native of Formia. Cicero possessed a favourite villa here,\r\nand was murdered in its vicinity in 43 B.C., but neither the villa nor\r\nthe tomb can be identified with any certainty. It was devastated by\r\nSextus Pompeius, and became a colony, with _duoviri_ as chief\r\nmagistrates, under Hadrian. Portus Caietae (the modern Gaeta) was\r\ndependent upon it.\r\n\r\n  See T. Ashby, \"Dessins inedits de Carlo Labruzzi,\" in _Melanges de\r\n  l'ecole francaise de Rome_ (1903), 410 seq.     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMIC ACID, H2CO2 or H.COOH, the first member of the series of\r\naliphatic monobasic acids of the general formula CnH_(2n)O2. It is\r\ndistinguished from the other members of the series by certain\r\ncharacteristic properties; for example, it shows an aldehydic character\r\nin reducing silver salts to metallic silver, and it does not form an\r\nacid chloride or an acid anhydride. Its nitrile (prussic acid) has an\r\nacid character, a property not possessed by the nitriles of the other\r\nmembers of the series; and, by the abstraction of the elements of water\r\nfrom the acid, carbon monoxide is produced, a reaction which finds no\r\nparallel in the higher members of the series. Finally, formic acid is,\r\nas shown by the determination of its affinity constant, a much stronger\r\nacid than the other acids of the series. It occurs naturally in red ants\r\n(Lat. _formica_), in stinging nettles, in some mineral waters, in animal\r\nsecretions and in muscle. It may be prepared artificially by the\r\noxidation of methyl alcohol and of formaldehyde; by the rapid heating of\r\noxalic acid (J. Gay-Lussac, _Ann. chim. phys._, 1831 [2] 46, p. 218),\r\nbut best by heating oxalic acid with glycerin, at a temperature of\r\n100-110 deg. C. (M. Berthelot, _Ann._, 1856, 98, p. 139). In this\r\nreaction a glycerol ester is formed as an intermediate product, and\r\nundergoes decomposition by the water which is also produced at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n    C3H5(OH)3 + H2C2O4 = C3H5(OH)2.OCHO+CO2 + H2O\r\n    C3H5(OH)2O.CHO + H2O = C3H5(OH)3 + H2CO2.\r\n\r\n  Many other synthetical processes for the production of the acid or its\r\n  salts are known. Hydrolysis of hydrocyanic acid by means of\r\n  hydrochloric acid yields formic acid. Chloroform boiled with alcoholic\r\n  potash forms potassium formate (J. Dumas, _Berzelius Jahresberichte_,\r\n  vol. 15, p. 371), a somewhat similar decomposition being shown by\r\n  chloral and aqueous potash (J. v. Liebig, _Ann._, 1832, 1, p. 198).\r\n  Formates are also produced by the action of moist carbon monoxide on\r\n  soda lime at 190-220 deg. C. (V. Merz and J. Tibicira, _Ber._, 1880,\r\n  13, p. 23; A. Geuther, _Ann._, 1880, 202, p. 317), or by the action of\r\n  moist carbon dioxide on potassium (H. Kolbe and R. Schmitt, _Ann._,\r\n  1861, 119, p. 251). H. Moissan (_Comptes rend._, 1902, 134, p. 261)\r\n  prepared potassium formate by passing a current of carbon monoxide or\r\n  carbon dioxide over heated potassium hydride,\r\n\r\n    KH + CO2 = KHCO2 and KH + 2CO = KHCO2 + C.\r\n\r\n  A concentrated acid may be obtained from the diluted acid either by\r\n  neutralization with soda, the sodium salt thus obtained being then\r\n  dried and heated with the equivalent quantity of anhydrous oxalic acid\r\n  (Lorin, _Bull. soc. chim._, 37, p. 104), or the lead or copper salt\r\n  may be decomposed by dry sulphuretted hydrogen at 130 deg. C. L.\r\n  Maquenne (_Bull. soc. chim._, 1888, 50, p. 662) distils the commercial\r\n  acid, _in vacuo_, with concentrated sulphuric acid below 75 deg. C.\r\n\r\n  Formic acid is a colourless, sharp-smelling liquid, which crystallizes\r\n  at 0 deg. C., melts at 8.6 deg. C. and boils at 100.8 deg. C. Its\r\n  specific gravity is 1.22 (20 deg./4 deg.). It is miscible in all\r\n  proportions with water, alcohol and ether. When heated with zinc dust,\r\n  the acid decomposes into carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The sodium and\r\n  potassium salts, when heated to 400 deg. C., give oxalates and\r\n  carbonates of the alkali metals, but the magnesium, calcium and\r\n  barium salts yield carbonates only. The free acid, when heated with\r\n  concentrated sulphuric acid, is decomposed into water and pure carbon\r\n  monoxide; when heated with nitric acid, it is oxidized first to oxalic\r\n  acid and finally to carbon dioxide. The salts of the acid are known as\r\n  _formates_, and are mostly soluble in water, those of silver and lead\r\n  being the least soluble. They crystallize well and are readily\r\n  decomposed. Concentrated sulphuric acid converts them into sulphates,\r\n  with simultaneous liberation of carbon monoxide. The calcium salt,\r\n  when heated with the calcium salts of higher homologues, gives\r\n  aldehydes. The silver and mercury salts, when heated, yield the metal,\r\n  with liberation of carbon dioxide and formation of free formic acid;\r\n  and the ammonium salt, when distilled, gives some formamide, HCONH2.\r\n  The esters of the acid may be obtained by distilling a mixture of the\r\n  sodium or potassium salts and the corresponding alcohol with\r\n  hydrochloric or sulphuric acids.\r\n\r\n  _Formamide_, HCONH2, is obtained by heating ethyl formate with\r\n  ammonia; by heating ammonium formate with urea to 140 deg. C.,\r\n\r\n    2HCO.ONH4 + CO(NH2)2 = 2HCONH2 + (NH4)2CO3;\r\n\r\n  by heating ammonium formate in a sealed tube for some hours at 230\r\n  deg. C., or by the action of sodium amalgam on a solution of potassium\r\n  cyanate (H. Basarow, _Ber._, 1871, 4, p. 409). It is a liquid which\r\n  boils _in vacuo_ at 150 deg., but at 192-195 deg. C. under ordinary\r\n  atmospheric pressure, with partial decomposition into carbon monoxide\r\n  and ammonia. It dissolves mercuric oxide, with the formation of\r\n  mercuric formamide, (HCONH)2Hg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMOSA, a northern territory of the Argentine republic, bounded N. by\r\nBolivia, N.E. and E. by Paraguay, S. by the Chaco Territory, and W. by\r\nSalta, with the Pilcomayo and Bermejo forming its northern and southern\r\nboundaries. Estimated area, 41,402 sq. m. It is a vast plain, sloping\r\ngently to the S.E., covered with marshes and tropical forests. Very\r\nlittle is known of it except small areas along the Bermejo and Paraguay\r\nrivers, where attempts have been made to form settlements. The\r\nunexplored interior is still occupied by tribes of wild Indians. The\r\nclimate is hot, the summer temperature rising to a maximum of 104 deg. F.\r\nTimber-cutting is the principal occupation of the settlers, though\r\nstock-raising and agriculture engage some attention in the settlements\r\non the Paraguay. The capital, Formosa (founded 1879), is a small\r\nsettlement on the Paraguay with a population of about 1000 in 1900. The\r\nsettled population of the territory was 4829 in 1895, which it was\r\nestimated had increased to 13,431 in 1905. The nomadic Indians are\r\nestimated at 8000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMOSA (called _Taiwan_ by the Chinese, and following them by the\r\nJapanese, into whose possession it came after their war with China in\r\n1895), an island in the western Pacific Ocean, between the Southern and\r\nthe Eastern China Sea, separated from the Chinese mainland by the\r\nFormosa Strait, which has a width of about 90 m. in its narrowest part.\r\nThe island is 225 m. long and from 60 to 80 m. broad, has a coast-line\r\nmeasuring 731 m., an area of 13,429 sq. m.--being thus nearly the same\r\nsize as Kiushiu, the most southern of the four chief islands forming the\r\nJapanese empire proper--and extends from 20 deg. 56' to 25 deg. 15' N.\r\nand from 120 deg. to 122 deg. E. It forms part of the long line of\r\nislands which are interposed as a protective barrier between the Asiatic\r\ncoast and the outer Pacific, and is the cause of the immunity from\r\ntyphoons enjoyed by the ports of China from Amoy to the Yellow Sea.\r\nAlong the western coast is a low plain, not exceeding 20 m. in extreme\r\nwidth; on the east coast there is a rich plain called Giran, and there\r\nare also some fertile valleys in the neighbourhood of Karenko and Pinan,\r\nextending up the longitudinal valleys of the rivers Karenko and Pinan,\r\nbetween which and the east coast the Taito range intervenes; but the\r\nrest of the island is mountainous and covered with virgin forest. In the\r\nplains the soil is generally of sand or alluvial clay, covered in the\r\nvalleys with a rich vegetable mould. The scenery of Formosa is\r\nfrequently of majestic beauty, and to this it is indebted for its\r\nEuropean name, happily bestowed by the early Spanish navigators.\r\n\r\nOn the addition of Formosa to her dominions, Fuji ceased to be Japan's\r\nhighest mountain, and took the third place on the list. Mount Morrison\r\n(14,270 ft.), which the Japanese renamed Niitaka-yama (New High\r\nMountain), stands first, and Mount Sylvia (12,480 ft.), to which they\r\ngive the name of Setzu-zan (Snowy Mountain), comes second. Mount\r\nMorrison stands nearly under the Tropic of Cancer. It is not volcanic,\r\nbut consists of argillaceous schist and quartzite. An ascent made by Dr\r\nHonda of the imperial university of Japan showed that, up to a height of\r\n6000 ft., the mountain is clothed with primeval forests of palms,\r\nbanyans, cork trees, camphor trees, tree ferns, interlacing creepers and\r\ndense thickets of rattan or stretches of grass higher than a man's\r\nstature. The next interval of 1000 ft. has gigantic cryptomerias and\r\nchamoecyparis; then follow pines; then, at a height of 9500 ft., a broad\r\nplateau, and then alternate stretches of grass and forest up to the top,\r\nwhich consists of several small peaks. There is no snow. Mount Morrison,\r\nbeing surrounded by high ranges, is not a conspicuous object. Mount\r\nSylvia lies in 24 deg. 30' N. lat. There are many other mountains of\r\nconsiderable elevation. In the north is Getsurobi-zan (4101 ft.); and on\r\neither side of Setzu-zan, with which they form a range running due east\r\nand west across the island, are Jusampunzan (4698 ft.) and Kali-zan\r\n(7027 ft.). Twenty-two miles due south of Kali-zan stands Hakumosha-zan\r\n(5282 ft.), and just 20 m. due south of Hakumosha-zan begins a chain of\r\nthree peaks, Suisha-zan (6200 ft.), Hoo-zan (4928), and Niitaka-yama.\r\nThese five mountains, Hari-zan, Hakumosha-zan, Suisha-zan, Hoo-zan and\r\nNiitaka-yama, stand almost exactly under 121 deg. E. long., in the very\r\ncentre of the island. But the backbone of the island lies east of them,\r\nextending S. from Setzu-zan through Gokan-zan, and Noko-zan and other\r\npeaks and bending S.W. to Niitaka-yama. Yet farther south, and still\r\nlying in line down the centre of the island, are Sankyakunan-zan (3752\r\nft.), Shurogi-zan (5729 ft.), Poren-zan (4957 ft.), and Kado-zan (9055\r\nft.), and, finally, in the south-east Arugan-zan (4985 ft.). These, it\r\nwill be observed, are all Japanese names, and the heights have been\r\ndetermined by Japanese observers. In addition to these remarkable inland\r\nmountains, Formosa's eastern shores show magnificent cliff scenery, the\r\nbases of the hills on the seaside taking the form of almost\r\nperpendicular walls as high as from 1500 to 2500 ft. Volcanic outbreaks\r\nof steam and sulphur-springs are found. Owing to the precipitous\r\ncharacter of the east coast few rivers of any size find their way to the\r\nsea in that direction. The west coast, on the contrary, has many\r\nstreams, but the only two of any considerable length are the Kotansui,\r\nwhich rises on Shurogi-zan, and has its mouth at Toko after a course of\r\nsome 60 m. and the Seirakei, which rises on Hakumosha-zan, and enters\r\nthe sea at a point 57 m. farther north after a course of 90 m.\r\n\r\nThe climate is damp, hot and malarious. In the north, the driest and\r\nbest months are October, November and December; in the south, December,\r\nJanuary, February and March. The sea immediately south of Formosa is the\r\nbirthplace of innumerable typhoons, but the high mountains of the island\r\nprotect it partially against the extreme violence of the wind.\r\n\r\n_Flora and Fauna._--The vegetation of the island is characterized by\r\ntropical luxuriance,--the mountainous regions being clad with dense\r\nforest, in which various species of palms, the camphor-tree (_Laurus\r\nCamphora_), and the aloe are conspicuous. Consul R. Swinhoe obtained no\r\nfewer than 65 different kinds of timber from a large yard in Taiwanfu;\r\nand his specimens are now to be seen in the museum at Kew. The tree\r\nwhich supplies the materials for the pith paper of the Chinese is not\r\nuncommon, and the cassia tree is found in the mountains. Travellers are\r\nespecially struck with the beauty of some of the wild flowers, more\r\nespecially with the lilies and convolvuluses; and European greenhouses\r\nhave been enriched by several Formosan orchids and other ornamental\r\nplants. The pine-apple grows in abundance. In the lowlands of the\r\nwestern portion, the Chinese have introduced a large number of\r\ncultivated plants and fruit trees. Rice is grown in such quantities as\r\nto procure for Formosa, in former days, the title of the \"granary of\r\nChina\"; and the sweet potato, taro, millet, barley, wheat and maize are\r\nalso cultivated. Camphor, sugar, tea, indigo, ground peanuts, jute,\r\nhemp, oil and rattans are all articles of export.\r\n\r\nThe Formosan fauna has been but partially ascertained; but at least\r\nthree kinds of deer, wild boars, bears, goats, monkeys (probably\r\n_Macacus speciosus_), squirrels, and flying squirrels are fairly\r\ncommon, and panthers and wild cats are not unfrequent. A poisonous but\r\nbeautiful green snake is often mentioned by travellers. Pheasants,\r\nducks, geese and snipe are abundant, and Dr C. Collingwood in his\r\n_Naturalist's Rambles in the China Seas_ mentions _Ardea prasinosceles_\r\nand other species of herons, several species of fly-catchers,\r\nkingfishers, shrikes and larks, the black drongo, the _Cotyle sinensis_\r\nand the _Prinia sonitans_. Dogs are kept by the savages for hunting. The\r\nhorse is hardly known, and his place is taken by the ox, which is\r\nregularly bridled and saddled and ridden with all dignity. The rivers\r\nand neighbouring seas seem to be well stocked with fish, and especial\r\nmention must be made of the turtles, flying-fish, and brilliant\r\ncoral-fish which swarm in the waters warmed by the _Kurosiwo_ current,\r\nthe gulf-stream of the Pacific. Shell-fish form an important article of\r\ndiet to both the Chinese and the aborigines along the coast--a species\r\nof _Cyrena_, a species of _Tapes_, _Cytheraea petechiana_ and _Modiola\r\nteres_ being most abundant.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The population of Formosa, according to a census in 1904,\r\nis estimated at 3,022,687, made up as follows: aborigines 104,334,\r\nChinese 2,860,574 and Japanese 51,770. The inhabitants of Formosa may be\r\ndivided into four classes: the Japanese, who are comparatively few, as\r\nthere has not been much tendency to immigration; the Chinese, many of\r\nwhom immigrated from the neighbourhood of Amoy and speak the dialect of\r\nthat district, while others were Hakkas from the vicinity of Swatow; the\r\nsubjugated aborigines, who largely intermingled with the Chinese; and\r\nthe uncivilized aborigines of the eastern region who refuse to recognize\r\nauthority and carry on raids as opportunity occurs. The semi-civilized\r\naborigines, who adopted the Chinese language, dress and customs, were\r\ncalled Pe-pa-hwan (_Anglice_ Pepo-hoans), while their wilder brethren\r\nbear the name of Chin-hwan or \"green savages,\" otherwise Sheng-fan or\r\n\"wild savages.\" They appear to belong to the Malay stock, and their\r\nlanguage bears out the supposition. They are broken up into almost\r\ncountless tribes and clans, many of which number only a few hundred\r\nindividuals, and their language consequently presents a variety of\r\ndialects, of which no classification has yet been effected: in the\r\ndistrict of Posia alone a member of the Presbyterian mission\r\ndistinguished eight different mutually unintelligible dialects. The\r\npeople themselves are described as of \"middle height, broad-chested and\r\nmuscular, with remarkably large hands and feet, the eyes large, the\r\nforehead round, and not narrow or receding in many instances, the nose\r\nbroad, the mouth large and disfigured with betel.\" The custom of\r\ntattooing is universal. In the north of the island at least, the dead\r\nare buried in a sitting posture under the bed on which they have\r\nexpired. Petty wars are extremely common, not only along the Chinese\r\nfrontiers, but between the neighbouring clans; and the heads of the\r\nslain are carefully preserved as trophies. In some districts the young\r\nmen and boys sleep in the skull-chambers, in order that they may be\r\ninspired with courage. Many of the tribes that had least intercourse\r\nwith the Chinese show a considerable amount of skill in the arts of\r\ncivilization. The use of Manchester prints and other European goods is\r\nfairly general; and the women, who make a fine native cloth from hemp,\r\nintroduce coloured threads from the foreign stuffs, so as to produce\r\nornamental devices. The office of chieftain is sometimes held by women.\r\n\r\nThe chief town is Taipe (called by the Japanese Taihoku), which is on\r\nthe Tamsui-yei river, and has a population of about 118,000, including\r\n5850 Japanese. Taipe may be said to have two ports; one, Tamsui, at the\r\nmouth of the river Tamsui-yei, 10 m. distant on the north-west coast,\r\nthe other Kelung (called by the Japanese Kiirun), on the north-east\r\nshore, with which it is connected by rail, a run of some 18 m. The\r\nforeign settlement at Taipe lies outside the walls of the city, and is\r\ncalled Twatutia (Taitotei by the Japanese). Kelung (the ancient Pekiang)\r\nis an excellent harbour, and the scenery is very beautiful. There are\r\ncoal-mines in the neighbourhood. Tamsui (called Tansui by the Japanese)\r\nis usually termed Hobe by foreigners. It is the site of the first\r\nforeign settlement, has a population of about 7000, but cannot be made a\r\ngood harbour without considerable expenditure. On the west coast there\r\nis no place of any importance until reaching Anping (23 deg. N. lat.), a\r\nport where a few foreign merchants reside for the sake of the sugar\r\ntrade. It is an unlovely place, surrounded by mud flats, and a hotbed of\r\nmalaria. It has a population of 4000 Chinese and 200 Japanese. At a\r\ndistance of some 2-1/2 m. inland is the former capital of Formosa, the\r\nwalled city of Tainan, which has a population of 100,000 Chinese, 2300\r\nJapanese, and a few British merchants and missionaries. Connected with\r\nAnping by rail (26 m.) and laying south of it is Takau, a treaty port.\r\nIt has a population of 6800, and is prettily situated on two sides of a\r\nlarge lagoon. Six miles inland from Takau is a prosperous Chinese town\r\ncalled Feng-shan (Japanese, Hozan). The anchorages on the east coast are\r\nSoo, Karenko and Pinan, which do not call for special notice.\r\nForty-seven m. east of the extreme south coast there is a little island\r\ncalled Botel-tobago (Japanese, Koto-sho), which rises to a height of\r\n1914 ft. and is inhabited by a tribe whose customs differ essentially\r\nfrom those of the natives on the main island.\r\n\r\n_Administration and Commerce._--The island is treated as an outlying\r\nterritory; it has not been brought within the full purview of the\r\nJapanese constitution. Its affairs are administered by a\r\ngovernor-general, who is also commander-in-chief of the forces, by a\r\nbureau of civil government, and by three prefectural governors, below\r\nwhom are the heads of twenty territorial divisions called _cho_; its\r\nfinances are not included in the general budget of the Japanese empire;\r\nit is garrisoned by a mixed brigade taken from the home divisions; and\r\nits currency is on a silver basis. One of the first abuses with which\r\nthe Japanese had to deal was the excessive use of opium by the Chinese\r\nsettlers. To interdict the importation of the drug altogether, as is\r\ndone in Japan, was the step advocated by Japanese public opinion. But,\r\ninfluenced by medical views and by the almost insuperable difficulty of\r\nenforcing any drastic import veto in the face of Formosa's large\r\ncommunications by junk with China, the Japanese finally adopted the\r\nmiddle course of licensing the preparation and sale of the drug, and\r\nlimiting its use to persons in receipt of medical sanction. Under the\r\nadministration of the Japanese the island has been largely developed.\r\nAmong other industries gold-mining is advancing rapidly. In 1902 48,400\r\noz. of gold representing a value of L168,626 were obtained from the\r\nmines and alluvial washings. Coal is also found in large quantities near\r\nKelung and sulphur springs exist in the north of the island.\r\n\r\nAn extensive scheme of railway construction has been planned, the four\r\nmain lines projected being (1) from Takau to Tainan; (2) from Tainan to\r\nKagi; (3) from Kagi to Shoka; and (4) from Shoka to Kelung; these four\r\nforming, in effect, a main trunk road running from the south-west to the\r\nnorth-east, its course being along the foot of the mountains that border\r\nthe western coast-plains. The Takau-Tainan section (26 m.) was opened to\r\ntraffic on the 3rd of November 1900, and by 1905 the whole line of 259\r\nm. was practically complete. Harbour improvements also are projected,\r\nbut in Formosa, as in Japan proper, paucity of capital constitutes a\r\nfatal obstacle to rapid development.\r\n\r\nThere are thirteen ports of export and import, but 75% of the total\r\nbusiness is done at Tamsui. Tea and camphor are the staple exports. The\r\ngreater part of the former goes to Amoy for re-shipment to the west, but\r\nit is believed that if harbour improvements were effected at Tamsui so\r\nas to render it accessible for ocean-going steamers, shipments would be\r\nmade thence direct to New York. The camphor trade being a government\r\nmonopoly, the quantity exported is under strict control.\r\n\r\n_History._--The island of Formosa must have been known from a very early\r\ndate to the Chinese who were established in the Pescadores. The\r\ninhabitants are mentioned in the official works of the Yuan dynasty as\r\n_Tung-fan_ or eastern barbarians; and under the Ming dynasty the island\r\nbegins to appear as Kilung. In the beginning of the 16th century it\r\nbegan to be known to the Portuguese and Spanish navigators, and the\r\nlatter at least made some attempts at establishing settlements or\r\nmissions. The Dutch were the first, however, to take footing in the\r\nisland; in 1624 they built a fort, Zelandia, on the east coast, where\r\nsubsequently rose the town of Taiwan, and the settlement was maintained\r\nfor thirty-seven years. On the expulsion of the Ming dynasty in China, a\r\nnumber of their defeated adherents came over to Formosa, and under a\r\nleader called in European accounts Coxinga, succeeded in expelling the\r\nDutch and taking possession of a good part of the island. In 1682 the\r\nChinese of Formosa recognized the emperor K'ang-hi, and the island then\r\nbegan to form part of the Chinese empire. From the close of the 17th\r\ncentury a long era of conflict ensued between the Chinese and the\r\naborigines. A more debased population than the peoples thus struggling\r\nfor supremacy could scarcely be conceived. The aborigines, _Sheng-fan_,\r\nor \"wild savages,\" deserved the appellation in some respects, for they\r\nlived by the chase and had little knowledge even of husbandry; while the\r\nChinese themselves, uneducated labourers, acknowledged no right except\r\nthat of might. The former were not implacably cruel or vindictive. They\r\nmerely clung to their homesteads, and harboured a natural resentment\r\nagainst the raiders who had dispossessed them. Their disposition was to\r\nleave the Chinese in unmolested possession of the plain. But some of the\r\nmost valuable products of the island, as camphor and rattan, are to be\r\nfound in the upland forests, and the Chinese, whenever they ventured too\r\nfar in search of these products, fell into ambushes of hill-men who\r\nneither gave nor sought quarter, and who regarded a Chinese skull as a\r\nspecially attractive article of household furniture. A violent rebellion\r\nis mentioned in 1788, put down only after the loss, it is said, of\r\n100,000 men by disease and sword, and the expenditure of 2,000,000 taels\r\nof silver. Reconciliation never took place on any large scale, though it\r\nis true that, in the course of time, some fitful displays of\r\nadministrative ability on the part of the Chinese, and the opening of\r\npartial means of communication, led to the pacification of a section of\r\nthe _Sheng-fan_, who thenceforth became known as Pe-pa-hwan\r\n(_Pepohoan_).\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the 19th century the island was chiefly known to\r\nEuropeans on account of the wrecks which took place on its coasts, and\r\nthe dangers that the crews had to run from the cannibal propensities of\r\nthe aborigines, and the almost equally cruel tendencies of the Chinese.\r\nAmong the most notable was the loss in 1842 of the British brig \"Ann,\"\r\nwith fifty-seven persons on board, of whom forty-three were executed at\r\nTaichu. By the treaty of Tientsin (1860) Taichu was opened to European\r\ncommerce, but the place was found quite unsuitable for a port of trade,\r\nand the harbour of Tamsui was selected instead. From 1859 both\r\nProtestant and Presbyterian missions were established in the island. An\r\nattack made on those at Feng-shan (Hozan) in 1868 led to the occupation\r\nof Fort Zelandia and Anping by British forces; but this action was\r\ndisapproved by the home government, and the indemnity demanded from the\r\nChinese restored. In 1874 the island was invaded by the Japanese for the\r\npurpose of obtaining satisfaction for the murder of a shipwrecked crew\r\nwho had been put to death by one of the semi-savage tribes on the\r\nsouthern coast, the Chinese government being either unable or unwilling\r\nto punish the culprits. A war was averted through the good offices of\r\nthe British minister, Sir T.F. Wade, and the Japanese retired on payment\r\nof an indemnity of 500,000 taels. The political state of the island\r\nduring these years was very bad; in a report of 1872 there is recorded a\r\nproverb among the official classes, \"every three years an outbreak,\r\nevery five a rebellion\"; but subsequent to 1877 some improvement was\r\nmanifested, and public works were pushed forward by the Chinese\r\nauthorities. In 1884, in the course of belligerent proceedings arising\r\nout of the Tongking dispute, the forts at Kelung on the north were\r\nbombarded by the French fleet, and the place was captured and held for\r\nsome months by French troops. An attack on the neighbouring town of\r\nTamsui failed, but a semi-blockade of the island was maintained by the\r\nFrench fleet during the winter and spring of 1884-1885. The troops were\r\nwithdrawn on the conclusion of peace in June 1885.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the island was ceded to Japan by the treaty of Shimonoseki at\r\nthe close of the Japanese war. The resident Chinese officials, however,\r\nrefused to recognize the cession, declared a republic, and prepared to\r\noffer resistance. It is even said they offered to transfer the\r\nsovereignty to Great Britain if that power would accept it. A formal\r\ntransfer to Japan was made in June of the same year in pursuance of the\r\ntreaty, the ceremony taking place on board ship outside Kelung, as the\r\nChinese commissioners did not venture to land. The Japanese were thus\r\nleft to take possession as best they could, and some four months elapsed\r\nbefore they effected a landing on the south of the island. Takau was\r\nbombarded and captured on the 15th of October, and the resistance\r\ncollapsed. Liu Yung-fu, the notorious Black Flag general, and the\r\nback-bone of the resistance, sought refuge in flight. The general state\r\nof the island when the Japanese assumed possession was that the plain of\r\nGiran on the eastern coast and the hill-districts were inhabited by\r\nsemi-barbarous folk, the western plains by Chinese of a degraded type,\r\nand that between the two there existed a traditional and continuous\r\nfeud, leading to mutual displays of merciless and murderous violence. By\r\nmany of these Chinese settlers the Japanese conquerors, when they came\r\nto occupy the island, were regarded in precisely the same light as the\r\nChinese themselves had been regarded from time immemorial by the\r\naborigines. Insurrections occurred frequently, the insurgents receiving\r\nsecret aid from sympathizers in China, and the difficulties of the\r\nJapanese being increased not only by their ignorance of the country,\r\nwhich abounds in fastnesses where bandits can find almost inaccessible\r\nrefuge, but also by the unwillingness of experienced officials to\r\nabandon their home posts for the purpose of taking service in the new\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--C.

He\r\nfirst appears in history when, as bishop of Porto, he was sent on an\r\nembassy to the Bulgarians. Having afterwards sided with a faction\r\nagainst John VIII., he was excommunicated, and compelled to take an oath\r\nnever to return to Rome or again to assume his priestly functions. From\r\nthis oath he was, however, absolved by Marinus, the successor of John\r\nVIII., and restored to his dignities; and on the death of Stephen V. in\r\n891 he was chosen pope. At that time the Holy See was engaged in a\r\nstruggle against the oppression of the princes of Spoleto, and a\r\npowerful party in Rome was eager to obtain the intervention of Arnulf,\r\nking of Germany, against these dangerous neighbours. Formosus himself\r\nshared this view; but he was forced to yield to circumstances and to\r\nconsecrate as emperor Lambert, the young son of Guy of Spoleto. Guy had\r\nalready been consecrated by Stephen V., and died in 894. In the\r\nfollowing year Arnulf succeeded in seizing Rome, and Formosus crowned\r\nhim emperor. But, as he was advancing on Spoleto against Lambert, Arnulf\r\nwas seized with paralysis, and was forced to return to Germany.\r\nOverwhelmed with chagrin, Formosus died on the 4th of April 896. The\r\ndiscords in which he had been involved continued after his death. The\r\nvalidity of his acts was contested on the pretext that, having been\r\noriginally bishop of Porto, he could not be a legitimate pope. The\r\nfundamental factor in these dissensions was the rivalry between the\r\nprinces of Spoleto and the Carolingian house, represented by the king of\r\nGermany. The body of Formosus was disinterred in 897 by Stephen VI., and\r\ntreated with contumely as that of a usurper of the papal throne; but\r\nTheodore II. restored it to Christian burial, and at a council presided\r\nover by John IX. the pontificate of Formosus was declared valid and all\r\nhis acts confirmed.     (L.

In the sciences, the word usually denotes a symbolical statement of\r\ncertain facts; for example, a chemical formula exhibits the composition\r\nof a substance (see CHEMISTRY); a botanical formula gives the\r\ndifferentia of a plant; a dentition formula indicates the arrangement\r\nand number of the teeth of an animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORNER, JUAN BAUTISTA PABLO (1756-1799), Spanish satirist and scholar,\r\nwas born at Merida (Badajoz) on the 23rd of February 1756, studied at\r\nthe university of Salamanca, and was called to the bar at Madrid in\r\n1783. During the next few years--under the pseudonyms of \"Tome Cecial,\"\r\n\"Pablo Segarra,\" \"Don Antonio Varas,\" \"Bartolo,\" \"Pablo Ignocausto,\" \"El\r\nBachiller Reganadientes,\" and \"Silvio Liberio\"--Forner was engaged in a\r\nseries of polemics with Garcia de la Huerta, Iriarte and other writers;\r\nthe violence of his attacks was so extreme that he was finally forbidden\r\nto publish any controversial pamphlets, and was transferred to a legal\r\npost at Seville. In 1796 he became crown prosecutor at Madrid, where he\r\ndied on the 17th of March 1799. Forner's brutality is almost unexampled,\r\nand his satirical writings give a false impression of his powers. His\r\n_Oracion apologetica por la Espana y su merito literario_ (1787) is an\r\nexcellent example of learned advocacy, far superior to similar efforts\r\nmade by Denina and Antonio Cavanilles; and his posthumous _Exequias de\r\nla lengua castellana_ (printed in the _Biblioteca de autores espanoles_,\r\nvol. lxiii.) testifies to his scholarship and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORRES (Gaelic, _far uis_, \"near water\"), a royal and police burgh of\r\nElginshire, Scotland. Pop. (1891) 3971; (1901) 4317. It is situated on\r\nthe Findhorn, which sweeps past the town and is crossed by a suspension\r\nbridge about a mile to the W., 11 m. W. of Elgin by the Highland\r\nrailway, and 6 m. by road from Findhorn, its port, due north. It is one\r\nof the most ancient towns in the north of Scotland. King Donald\r\n(892-900), son of Constantine, died in Forres, not without suspicion of\r\npoisoning, and in it King Duff (961-967) was murdered. Macbeth is said\r\nto have slain Duncan in the first structure that gave its name to\r\nCastlehill, which was probably the building demolished in 1297 by the\r\nadherents of Wallace. The next castle was a royal residence from 1189 to\r\n1371 and was occupied occasionally by William the Lion, Alexander II.\r\nand David II. It was burned down by the Wolf of Badenoch in 1390. The\r\nruins on the hill, however, are those of a later edifice and are\r\nsurmounted by a granite obelisk, 65 ft. high, raised to the memory of\r\nSurgeon James Thomson, a native of Cromarty, who at the cost of his life\r\ntended the Russian wounded on the field of the Alma. The public\r\nbuildings include the town hall, a fine and commodious house on the site\r\nof the old tolbooth; the Falconer museum, containing among other\r\nexhibits several valuable fossils, and named after Dr Hugh Falconer\r\n(1808-1865), the distinguished palaeontologist and botanist, a native of\r\nthe town; the mechanics' institute; the agricultural and market hall;\r\nLeanchoil hospital and Anderson's Institution for poor boys. The cross,\r\nin Decorated Gothic, stands beside the town hall. Adjoining the town on\r\nthe south-east is the beautifully-wooded Cluny Hill, a favourite public\r\nresort, carrying on its summit the tower, 70 ft. high, which was erected\r\nin 1806 to the memory of Nelson, and on its southern slopes a well-known\r\nhydropathic. An excellent golf-course extends from Kinloss to Findhorn.\r\nThe industries comprise the manufacture of chemicals and artificial\r\nmanures, granite polishing, flour and sawmills, boot- and shoe-making,\r\ncarriage-building and woollen manufactures. There is also considerable\r\ntrade in cattle.\r\n\r\nSueno's Stone, about 23 ft. high, probably the finest sculptured\r\nmonolith in Scotland, stands in a field to the east of the town. Its\r\norigin and character have given rise to endless surmises. It is carved\r\nwith figures of soldiers, priests, slaughtered men and captives on one\r\nside, and on the other with a cross and Runic ornamentation. One theory\r\nis that it is a relic of the early Christian church, symbolizing the\r\nbattle of life and the triumph of good over evil. According to an older\r\ntradition it was named after Sueno, son of Harold, king of Denmark, who\r\nwon a victory on the spot in 1008. A third conjecture is that it\r\ncommemorates the expulsion of the Danes from Moray in 1014. Skene's view\r\nis that it chronicles the struggle in 900 between Sigurd, earl of\r\nOrkney, and Maelbrigd, Maormor of Moray. Another storied stone is called\r\nthe Witches' Stone, because it marks the place near Forres where Macbeth\r\nis said to have encountered the weird sisters.\r\n\r\nForres is one of the Inverness district group of parliamentary burghs,\r\nthe other members being Nairn, Fortrose and Inverness. The town is\r\namongst the healthiest in Scotland and has the lowest rainfall in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nWithin 2 m. of Forres, to the S.W., lie the beautiful woods of Altyre,\r\nthe seat of the Gordon-Cummings. Three miles farther south is Relugas\r\nHouse, the favourite residence of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, romantically\r\nsituated on a height near the confluence of the Divie and the Findhorn.\r\nNot far away stand the ruins of the old castle of Dunphail. On the left\r\nbank of the Findhorn, 3-1/2 m. W. of Forres, is situated Brodie Castle,\r\npartly ancient and partly modern. The Brodies--the old name of their\r\nestate was Brothie, from the Irish _broth_, a ditch, in allusion to the\r\ntrench that ran from the village of Dyke to the north of the house--were\r\na family of great consequence at the period of the Covenant. Alexander\r\nBrodie (1617-1680), the fourteenth laird, was one of the commissioners\r\nwho went to the Hague to treat with Charles II., and afterwards became a\r\nScottish lord of session and an English judge. He and his son were\r\nregarded as amongst the staunchest of the Presbyterians. Farther south\r\nis the forest of Darnaway, famous for its oaks, in which stands the earl\r\nof Moray's mansion of Darnaway Castle. It occupies the site of the\r\ncastle which was built by Thomas Randolph, the first earl. Attached to\r\nit is the great hall, capable of accommodating 1000 men, with an open\r\nroof of fine dark oak, the only remaining portion of the castle that was\r\nerected by Archibald Douglas, earl of Moray, in 1450. Queen Mary held a\r\ncouncil in it in 1562. Earl Randolph's chair, not unlike the coronation\r\nchair, has been preserved. Kinloss Abbey, now in ruins, stands some 2-1/2\r\nm. to the N.E. of Forres. It was founded in 1150 by David I., and\r\nremained in the hands of the Cistercians till its suppression at the\r\nReformation. Robert Reid, who ruled from 1526 to 1540, was its greatest\r\nabbot. His hobby was gardening, and it is believed that many of the 123\r\nvarieties of pears and 146 varieties of apples for which the district is\r\nfamous were due to his skill and enterprise. Edward I. stayed in the\r\nabbey for a short time in 1303 and Queen Mary spent two nights in it in\r\n1562.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORREST, EDWIN (1806-1872), American actor, was born at Philadelphia,\r\nPennsylvania, on the 9th of March 1806, of Scottish and German descent.\r\nHe made his first stage appearance on the 27th of November 1820, at the\r\nWalnut Street theatre, in Home's _Douglas_. In 1826 he had a great\r\nsuccess in New York as Othello. He played at Drury Lane in the\r\n_Gladiator_ in 1836, but his Macbeth in 1845 was hissed by the English\r\naudience, and his affront to Macready in Edinburgh shortly\r\nafterwards--when he stood up in a private box and hissed him,--was fatal\r\nto his popularity in Great Britain. His jealousy of Macready resulted in\r\nthe Astor Place riot in 1849. In 1837 he had married Catherine, daughter\r\nof John Sinclair, an English singer, and his divorce suit in 1852 was a\r\n_cause celebre_ which hurt his reputation and soured his temper. His\r\nlast appearance was as Richelieu in Boston in 1871. He died on the 12th\r\nof December 1872. He had amassed a large fortune, much of which he left\r\nby will to found a home for aged actors.\r\n\r\n  See Lawrence Barrett's _Edwin Forrest_ (Boston, 1881).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORREST, SIR JOHN (1847- ), West Australian statesman and explorer, son\r\nof William Forrest, of Bunbury, West Australia, was born near Bunbury,\r\non the 22nd of August 1847, and educated at Perth, W.A. In 1865 he\r\nbecame connected with the Government Survey Department at Perth, and in\r\n1869 led an exploring expedition into the interior in search of D.\r\nLeichardt, penetrating through bush and salt-marshes as far inland as\r\n123 deg. E. In 1870 he again made an expedition from Perth to Adelaide,\r\nalong the southern shores. In 1874, with his brother Alexander Forrest\r\n(born 1849), he explored eastwards from Champion Bay, following as far\r\nas possible the 26th parallel, and striking the telegraph line between\r\nAdelaide and Port Darwin; a distance of about 2000 m. was covered in\r\nabout five months with horses and without carriers, a particularly fine\r\nachievement (see AUSTRALIA: _Exploration_). John Forrest also surveyed\r\nin 1878 the north-western district between the rivers Ashburton and Lady\r\nGrey, and in 1882 the Fitzroy district. In 1876 he was made deputy\r\nsurveyor-general, receiving the thanks of the colony for his services\r\nand a grant of 5000 acres of land; for a few months at the end of 1878\r\nhe acted as commissioner of crown lands and surveyor-general, being\r\ngiven the full appointment in 1883 and retaining it till 1890. When the\r\ncolony obtained in 1890 its constitution of self-government, Sir John\r\nForrest (who was made K.C.M.G. in 1891, and G.C.M.G. in 1901) became its\r\nfirst premier, and he held that position till in 1901 he joined the\r\nCommonwealth government, first as minister for defence, later as\r\nminister for home affairs and postmaster-general, resigning the office\r\nof federal treasurer in July 1907. His influence in West Australia was\r\none of an almost autocratic character, owing to the robust vigour of his\r\npersonality and his success in enforcing his views (see WESTERN\r\nAUSTRALIA: _History_). In 1897 he was made a member of the Privy\r\nCouncil. Sir John Forrest married in 1876 Margaret Hamersley. He\r\npublished _Explorations in Australia_ (1876) and _Notes on Western\r\nAustralia_ (1884-1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORREST, NATHAN BEDFORD (1821-1877), Confederate cavalry general in the\r\nAmerican Civil War, was born near Chapel Hill, Tennessee, on the 13th of\r\nJuly 1821. Before his father's death in 1837 the family had removed to\r\nMississippi, and for some years thereafter it was supported principally\r\nby Nathan, who was the eldest son. Thus he never received any formal\r\neducation (as witnessed by the uncouth phraseology and spelling of his\r\nwar despatches), but he managed to teach himself with very fair success,\r\nand is said to have possessed considerable ability as a mathematician.\r\nHe was in turn a horse and cattle trader in Mississippi, and a slave\r\ndealer and horse trader in Memphis, until 1859, when he took to cotton\r\nplanting in north-western Mississippi, where he acquired considerable\r\nwealth. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 he volunteered as a\r\nprivate, raised a cavalry battalion, of which he was lieut.-colonel, and\r\nin February 1862 took part in the defence of Fort Donelson, and\r\nrefusing, like Generals Floyd and Pillow, to capitulate with the rest of\r\nthe Confederate forces, made his way out, before the surrender, with all\r\nthe mounted troops there. He was promptly made a colonel and regimental\r\ncommander, and fought at Shiloh with distinction, receiving a severe\r\nwound. Shortly after this he was promoted brigadier-general (July 1862).\r\nAt the head of a mounted brigade he took a brilliant part in General\r\nBragg's autumn campaign, and in the winter of 1862-1863 he was\r\ncontinually active in raiding the hostile lines of communication. These\r\nraids have been the theme of innumerable discussions, and on the whole\r\ntheir value seems to have been overrated. At the same time, and apart\r\nfrom the question of their utility, Forrest's raids were uniformly bold\r\nand skilful, and are his chief title to fame in the history of the\r\ncavalry arm. Indeed, next to Stuart and Sheridan, he was the finest\r\ncavalry leader of the whole war. One of the most remarkable of his\r\nactions was his capture, near Rome, Georgia, after five days of marching\r\nand fighting, of an entire cavalry brigade under Colonel A.D. Streight\r\n(April 1863). He was present at the battle of Chickamauga in September,\r\nafter which (largely on account of his criticism of General Bragg, the\r\narmy commander) he was transferred to the Mississippi. Forrest was made\r\na major-general in December 1863. In the winter of 1863-1864 he was as\r\nactive as ever, and in the spring of 1864 he raided as far north as\r\nPaducah, Ky. On the 12th of April 1864 he assaulted and captured Fort\r\nPillow, in Tennessee on the Mississippi; U.S. negro troops formed a\r\nlarge part of the garrison and according to survivors many were\r\nmassacred after the fort had surrendered. The \"Massacre of Fort Pillow\"\r\nhas been the subject of much controversy and there is much conflicting\r\ntestimony regarding it, but it seems probable that Forrest himself had\r\nno part in it. On the 10th of June Forrest decisively defeated a\r\nsuperior Federal force at Brice's Cross Roads, Miss., and throughout the\r\nyear, though the greatest efforts were made by the Federals to crush\r\nhim, he raided in Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama with almost\r\nunvarying success. He was once more with the main Confederate army of\r\nthe West in the last disastrous campaign of Nashville, and fought\r\nstubborn rearguard actions to cover the retreat of the broken\r\nConfederates. In February 1865 he was made a lieut.-general, but the\r\nstruggle was almost at an end and General James H. Wilson, one of the\r\nablest of the Union cavalry generals, rapidly forced back the few\r\nConfederates, now under Forrest's command, and stormed Selma, Alabama,\r\non the 2nd of April. The surrender of General Forrest and his whole\r\ncommand, under the agreement between General Richard Taylor and General\r\nE.S. Canby, followed on the 9th of May. After the war he lived in\r\nMemphis. He sold his cotton plantation in 1867, and for some years was\r\npresident of the Selma, Marion and Memphis Railroad. He died at Memphis,\r\nTennessee, on the 29th of October 1877.\r\n\r\nThe military character of General Forrest, apart from questions of his\r\ntechnical skill, horsemastership and detail special to his arm of the\r\nservice, was admittedly that of a great leader. He never commanded a\r\nlarge force of all arms. He was uneducated, and had neither experience\r\nof nor training for the strategical handling of great armies. Yet his\r\npersonality and his natural soldierly gifts were such that General\r\nSherman considered him \"the most remarkable man the Civil War produced\r\non either side.\" Joseph Johnston, the Confederate general whose\r\ngreatness lay above all in calm and critical judgment, said that\r\nForrest, had he had the advantage of a thorough military training,\r\n\"would have been the great central figure of the war.\"\r\n\r\n  See the biographies by J.A. Wyeth (1899) and J.H. Mathes (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSKAL, PETER (1736-1763), Swedish traveller and naturalist, was born\r\nin Kalmar in 1736. He studied at Gottingen, where he published a\r\ndissertation entitled _Dubia de principiis philosophiae recentioris_\r\n(1756). Thence he returned to his native country, which, however, he had\r\nto leave after the publication of a pamphlet entitled _Pensees sur la\r\nliberte civile_ (1759). By Linnaeus he was recommended to Frederick V.\r\nof Denmark, who appointed him to accompany Carsten Niebuhr in an\r\nexpedition to Arabia and Egypt in 1761. He died of the plague at Jerim\r\nin Arabia on the 11th of July 1763.\r\n\r\n  His friend and companion, Niebuhr, was entrusted with the care of\r\n  editing his MSS., and published in 1775 _Descriptiones animalium,\r\n  avium, amphibiorum, piscium, insectorum, vermium, quae in itin.\r\n  Orient. observavit Petrus Forskal_. In the same year appeared also his\r\n  account of the plants of Arabia Felix and of lower Egypt, under the\r\n  title of _Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSSELL, HANS LUDVIG (1843-1901), Swedish historian and political\r\nwriter, the son of Adolf Forssell, a distinguished mathematician, was\r\nborn at Gefle, where his father was professor, on 14th January 1843. At\r\nthe age of sixteen he became a student in Upsala University, where he\r\ndistinguished himself, and where, in 1866, having taken the degree of\r\ndoctor, he was appointed reader in history. At the age of thirty,\r\nhowever, Forssell, who had already shown remarkable business capacity,\r\nwas called to Stockholm, where he filled one important post after\r\nanother in the Swedish civil service. In 1875 he was appointed head of\r\nthe treasury, and in 1880 was transferred to the department of inland\r\nrevenue, of which he continued to be president until the time of his\r\ndeath. In addition to the responsibilities which these offices devolved\r\nupon him, Forssell was constantly called to serve on royal commissions,\r\nand his political influence was immense. In spite of all these public\r\nduties, which he carried through with the utmost diligence, Forssell\r\nalso found leisure for an abundant literary activity. Of his historical\r\nwritings the most important were: _The Administrative and Economical\r\nHistory of Sweden after Gustavus I._ (1869-1875) and _Sweden in 1571_\r\n(1872). He was also for several years, in company with the poet Wirsen,\r\neditor of the _Swedish Literary Review_. He published two volumes of\r\n_Studies and_ _Criticisms_ (1875, 1888). In the year 1881, at the death\r\nof the historian Anders Fryxell, Forssell was elected to the vacant seat\r\non the Swedish Academy. The energy of Forssell was so great, and he\r\nunderstood so little the economy of strength, that he unquestionably\r\novertaxed his vital force. His death, however, which occurred with great\r\nsuddenness on the 2nd of August 1901 while he was staying at San\r\nBernardino in Switzerland, was wholly unexpected. There was little of\r\nthe typical Swedish urbanity in Forssell's exterior manner, which was\r\nsomewhat dry and abrupt. Like many able men who have from early life\r\nadministered responsible public posts, there appeared a certain want of\r\nsympathy in his demands upon others. His views were distinct, and held\r\nwith great firmness; for example, he was a free-trader, and his\r\nconsistent opposition to what he called \"the new system\" had a\r\nconsiderable effect on Swedish policy. He was not exactly an attractive\r\nman, but he was a capable, upright and efficient public servant. In 1867\r\nhe married Miss Zulamith Eneroth, a daughter of the well-known\r\npomologist of Upsala; she survived him, with two sons and two daughters.\r\n     (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORST (originally FORSTA or FORSTE), a town of Germany, in the Prussian\r\nprovince of Brandenburg, on the Neisse, 44 m. S.E. of Frankfort-on-Oder.\r\nPop. (1905) 33,757. It has two Evangelical, a Roman Catholic and an Old\r\nLutheran church; there are two schools and two hospitals in the town.\r\nThe chief industry of Forst is the manufacture of cloth, but spinning,\r\ndyeing and the making of artificial flowers are also carried on. Founded\r\nin the 13th century, Forst passed in 1667 to the duke of Saxe-Merseburg,\r\nbecoming part of electoral Saxony in 1740. It was ceded to Prussia in\r\n1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSTER, FRANCOIS (1790-1872), French engraver, was born at Locle in\r\nNeufchatel, on the 22nd of August 1790. In 1805 he was apprenticed to an\r\nengraver in Paris, and he also studied painting and engraving\r\nsimultaneously in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. His preference was\r\nultimately fixed on the latter art, and on his obtaining in 1814 the\r\nfirst \"grand prix de gravure,\" the king of Prussia, who was then with\r\nthe allies in Paris, bestowed on him a gold medal, and a pension of 1500\r\nfrancs for two years. With the aid of this sum he pursued his studies in\r\nRome, where his attention was devoted chiefly to the works of Raphael.\r\nIn 1844 he succeeded Tardieu in the Academy. He died at Paris on the\r\n27th of June 1872. Forster occupied the first position among the French\r\nengravers of his time, and was equally successful in historical pieces\r\nand in portraits. Among his works may be mentioned--The Three Graces,\r\nand _La Vierge de la legende_, after Raphael; _La Vierge au bas-relief_,\r\nafter Leonardo da Vinci; Francis I. and Charles V., after Gros; St\r\nCecilia, after Paul Delaroche; Albert Durer and Henry IV., after Porbus;\r\nWellington, after Gerard; and Queen Victoria, after Winterhalter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSTER, FRIEDRICH CHRISTOPH (1791-1868), German historian and poet, was\r\nthe second son of Karl Christoph Forster (1751-1811), and consequently a\r\nbrother of the painter, Ernest Joachim Forster (1800-1885). Born at\r\nMunchengosserstadt on the Saale on the 24th of September 1791, he\r\nreceived his early education at Altenburg, and after a course of\r\ntheology at Jena, devoted some time to archaeology and the history of\r\nart. At the outbreak of the War of Liberation in 1813, he joined the\r\narmy, quickly attaining the rank of captain; and by his war-songs added\r\nto the national enthusiasm. On the conclusion of the war he was\r\nappointed professor at the school of engineering and artillery in\r\nBerlin, but on account of some democratic writings he was dismissed from\r\nthis office in 1817. He then became connected with various journals\r\nuntil about 1829, when he received an appointment at the royal museum in\r\nBerlin, with the title of court councillor (_Hofrat_). He was the\r\nfounder and secretary of the _Wissenschaftlicher Kunstverein_ in Berlin,\r\nand died in Berlin on the 8th of November 1868. Forster's principal\r\nworks are: _Beitrage zur neueren Kriegsgeschichte_ (Berlin, 1816);\r\n_Grundzuge der Geschichte des preussischen Staates_ (Berlin, 1818); _Der\r\nFeldmarschall Blucher und seine Umgebungen_ (Leipzig, 1820); _Friedrich\r\nder Grosse, Jugendjahre, Bildung und Geist_ (Berlin, 1822); _Albrecht\r\nvon Wallenstein_ (Potsdam, 1834); _Friedrich Wilhelm I., Konig von\r\nPreussen_ (Potsdam, 1834-1835); _Die Hofe und Kabinette Europas im 18.\r\nJahrhundert_ (Potsdam, 1836-1839); _Leben und Taten Friedrichs des\r\nGrossen_ (Meissen, 1840-1841); _Wallensteins Prozess_ (Leipzig, 1844);\r\nand _Preussens Helden in Krieg und Frieden, neuere und neueste\r\npreussische Geschichte_, 7 volumes (Berlin, 1849-1860). The three\r\nconcluding volumes of this work contain the history of the war of\r\nliberation of 1813-14-15. He brought out an edition of Hegel's works,\r\nadapted several of Shakespeare's plays for the theatre, wrote a number\r\nof poems and an historical drama, _Gustav Adolf_ (Berlin, 1832).\r\n\r\n  Many of his lesser writings were collected and published as\r\n  _Kriegslieder, Romanzen, Erzahlungen und Legenden_ (Berlin, 1838). The\r\n  beginning of an autobiography of Forster, edited by H. Kletke, has\r\n  been published under the title, _Kunst und Leben_ (Berlin, 1873).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSTER, JOHANN GEORG ADAM (1754-1794), German traveller and author, was\r\nborn at Nassenhuben, a small village near Danzig, on the 27th of\r\nNovember 1754. His father, Johann Reinhold Forster, a man of great\r\nscientific attainments but an intractable temper, was at that time\r\npastor of the place; the family are said to have been of Scottish\r\nextraction. In 1765 the elder Forster was commissioned by the empress\r\nCatherine to inspect the Russian colonies in the province of Saratov,\r\nwhich gave his son an opportunity of acquiring the Russian language and\r\nthe elements of a scientific education. After a few years the father\r\nquarrelled with the Russian government, and went to England, where he\r\nobtained a professorship of natural history and the modern languages at\r\nthe famous non-conformist academy at Warrington. His violent temper soon\r\ncompelled him to resign this appointment, and for two years he and his\r\nson earned a precarious livelihood by translations in London--a\r\npractical education, however, exceedingly useful to the younger Forster,\r\nwho became a thorough master of English, and acquired many of the ideas\r\nwhich chiefly influenced his subsequent life. At length the turning\r\npoint in his career came in the shape of an invitation for him and his\r\nfather to accompany Captain Cook in his third voyage round the world.\r\nSuch an expedition was admirably calculated to call forth Forster's\r\npeculiar powers. His account of Cook's voyage (_A Voyage round the\r\nWorld_, London, 1777; in German, Berlin, 1778-1780), is almost the first\r\nexample of the glowing yet faithful description of natural phenomena\r\nwhich has since made a knowledge of them the common property of the\r\neducated world. The publication of this work was, however, impeded for\r\nsome time by differences with the admiralty, during which Forster\r\nproceeded to the continent to obtain an appointment for his father as\r\nprofessor at Cassel, and found to his surprise that it was conferred\r\nupon himself. The elder Forster, however, was soon provided for\r\nelsewhere, being appointed professor of natural history at Halle. At\r\nCassel Forster formed an intimate friendship with the great anatomist\r\nSommerring, and about the same time made the acquaintance of Jacobi, who\r\ngave him a leaning towards mysticism from which he subsequently\r\nemancipated himself. The want of books and scientific apparatus at\r\nCassel induced him to resort frequently to Gottingen, where he became\r\nbetrothed to Therese Heyne, the daughter of the illustrious philologist,\r\na clever and cultivated woman, but ill-suited to be Forster's wife. To\r\nbe able to marry he accepted (1784) a professorship at the university of\r\nWilna, which he did not find to his taste. The penury and barbarism of\r\nPolish circumstances are graphically described in his and his wife's\r\nletters of this period. After a few years' residence at Wilna he\r\nresigned his appointment to participate in a scientific expedition\r\nprojected by the Russian government, and upon the relinquishment of this\r\nundertaking became librarian to the elector of Mainz. He actively\r\npromoted the incorporation of the left bank of the Rhine with France and\r\nin 1793 went to Paris to carry on the negotiations. Meanwhile, however,\r\nthe Germans seized Mainz, and Forster--already disheartened by the turn\r\nof events in France--was cut off from all return. Domestic sorrows were\r\nadded to his political troubles and he died suddenly at Paris on the\r\n10th of January 1794.\r\n\r\nForster's masterpiece is his _Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant,\r\nFlandern, Holland, England und Frankreich_ (1791-1794), one of the\r\nablest books of travel of the 18th century. His style is clear and\r\nvivid; his method of describing what he sees extraordinarily plastic;\r\nabove all, he has the art of presenting objects to us from their most\r\ninteresting and attractive side. The same qualities are also more or\r\nless conspicuous in his minor writings. By his translation (from the\r\nEnglish) of the _Sakuntala_ of Kalidasa (1791), he first awakened German\r\ninterest in Indian literature.\r\n\r\n  Forster's _Samtliche Werke_ appeared at Leipzig in 9 vols. in 1843.\r\n  The _Ansichten vom Rhein_, &c., has been frequently reprinted (best\r\n  edition by A. Leitzmann, Halle, 1893); Leitzmann has also published\r\n  (Stuttgart, 1894) a selection of Forster's _Kleine Schriften_, which\r\n  originally appeared in 6 vols. (1789-1797). His correspondence was\r\n  published by his wife (2 vols., Leipzig, 1829); his _Briefwechsel mit\r\n  Sommerring_ by H. Hettner (Brunswick, 1877). See J. Moleschott, _G.\r\n  Forster, der Naturforscher des Volks_ (1854; 3rd ed., 1874); K. Klein,\r\n  _G. Forster in Mainz_ (Gotha, 1863); A. Leitzmann, _G. Forster_\r\n  (Vorlesung) (Halle, 1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSTER, JOHN (1812-1876), English biographer and critic, was born on\r\nthe 2nd of April 1812 at Newcastle. His father, who was a Unitarian and\r\nbelonged to the junior branch of a good Northumberland family, was a\r\ncattle-dealer. After being well grounded in classics and mathematics at\r\nthe grammar school of his native town, John Forster was sent in 1828 to\r\nCambridge, but after only a month's residence he removed to London,\r\nwhere he attended classes at University College, and was entered at the\r\nInner Temple. He devoted himself, however, chiefly to literary pursuits.\r\nHe contributed to _The True Sun, The Morning Chronicle_ and to _The\r\nExaminer_, for which he acted as literary and dramatic critic; and the\r\ninfluence of his powerful individuality soon made itself felt. His\r\n_Lives of the Statesmen of the Commonwealth_ (1836-1839) appeared partly\r\nin Lardner's Cyclopaedia. He published the work separately in 1840 with\r\na _Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History_. Its merits\r\nobtained immediate recognition, and Forster became a prominent figure in\r\nthat distinguished circle of literary men which included Bulwer,\r\nTalfourd, Albany, Fonblanque, Landor, Carlyle and Dickens. Forster is\r\nsaid to have been for some time engaged to Letitia Landon, but the\r\nengagement was broken off, and Miss Landon married George Maclean. In\r\n1843 he was called to the bar but he never became a practising lawyer.\r\nFor some years he edited the _Foreign Quarterly Review_; in 1846, on the\r\nretirement of Charles Dickens, he took charge for some months of the\r\n_Daily News_; and from 1847 to 1856 he edited the _Examiner_. From 1836\r\nonwards he contributed to the _Edinburgh Quarterly_ and _Foreign\r\nQuarterly_ Reviews a variety of articles, some of which were republished\r\nin two volumes of _Biographical and Historical Essays_ (1858). In 1848\r\nappeared his admirable _Life and Times of Oliver Goldsmith_ (revised in\r\n1854). Continuing his researches into English history under the early\r\nStuarts, he published in 1860 the _Arrest of the Five Members by Charles\r\nI.--A Chapter of English History rewritten_, and _The Debates on the\r\nGrand Remonstrance, with an Introductory Essay on English Freedom_.\r\nThese were followed by his _Sir John Eliot: a Biography_ (1864),\r\nelaborated from one of his earlier studies for the _Lives of Eminent\r\nBritish Statesmen_. In 1868 appeared his _Life of Landor_, and, on the\r\ndeath of his friend Alexander Dyce, Forster undertook the publication of\r\nhis third edition of Shakespeare. For several years he had been\r\ncollecting materials for a life of Swift, but he interrupted his studies\r\nin this direction to write his standard _Life of Charles Dickens_. He\r\nhad long been intimate with the novelist, and it is by this work that\r\nJohn Forster is now chiefly remembered. The first volume appeared in\r\n1872, and the biography was completed in 1874. Towards the close of 1875\r\nthe first volume of his _Life of Swift_ was published; and he had made\r\nsome progress in the preparation of the second at the time of his death\r\non the 2nd of February 1876. In 1855 Forster had been appointed\r\nsecretary to the lunacy commission, and from 1861 to 1872 he held the\r\noffice of a commissioner in lunacy. His valuable collection of\r\nmanuscripts, including the original copies of Charles Dickens's novels,\r\ntogether with his books and pictures, was bequeathed to South\r\nKensington Museum.\r\n\r\n  An admirable account of him by Henry Morley is prefixed to the\r\n  official handbook (1877) of the Dyce and Forster bequests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSTER, JOHN COOPER (1823-1886), British surgeon, was born in 1823 in\r\nLambeth, London, where his father and grandfather before him had been\r\nlocal medical practitioners. He entered Guy's hospital in 1841, was\r\nappointed demonstrator of anatomy in 1850, assistant-surgeon, 1855, and\r\nsurgeon, 1870. He became a member of the College of Surgeons in 1844,\r\nfellow in 1849 and president in 1884. He was a prompt and sometimes bold\r\noperator. In 1858 he performed practically the first gastrostomy in\r\nEngland for a case of cancer of the oesophagus. Among his best-known\r\npapers were discussions of acupressure, syphilis, hydrophobia,\r\nintestinal obstruction, modified obturator hernia, torsion, and colloid\r\ncancer of the large intestine; and he published a book on _Surgical\r\nDiseases of Children_ in 1860, founded on his experience as surgeon to\r\nthe hospital for children and women in Waterloo Road. He died suddenly\r\nin London on the 2nd of March 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSTER, WILLIAM EDWARD (1818-1886), British statesman, was born of Quaker\r\nparents at Bradpole in Dorsetshire on the 11th of July 1818. He was\r\neducated at the Friends' school at Tottenham, where his father's family\r\nhad long been settled, and on leaving school he was put into business. He\r\ndeclined, however, on principle, to enter a brewery. Becoming in due time\r\na woollen manufacturer in a large way at Bradford, Yorkshire (from which\r\nafter his marriage he moved to Burley-in-Wharfedale), he soon made himself\r\nknown as a practical philanthropist. In 1846-1847 he accompanied his\r\nfather to Ireland as distributor of the Friends' relief fund for the\r\nfamine in Connemara, and the state of the country made a deep impression\r\non him. In 1849 he wrote a preface to a new edition of Clarkson's _Life of\r\nWilliam Penn_, defending the Quaker statesman against Macaulay's\r\ncriticisms. In 1850 he married Jane Martha, eldest daughter of the famous\r\nDr Arnold of Rugby. She was not a Quaker, and her husband was formally\r\nexcommunicated for marrying her, but the Friends who were commissioned to\r\nannounce the sentence \"shook hands and stayed to luncheon.\" Forster\r\nthereafter ranked himself as a member of the Church of England, for which,\r\nindeed, he was in later life charged with having too great a partiality.\r\nThere were no children of the marriage, but when Mrs Forster's brother,\r\nWilliam Arnold, died in 1859, leaving four orphans, the Forsters adopted\r\nthem as their own.\r\n\r\nOne of these children was Mr H.O. Arnold-Forster (1855-1909), the\r\nwell-known Liberal-Unionist member of parliament, who eventually became\r\na member of Mr Balfour's cabinet; he was secretary to the admiralty\r\n(1900-1903), and then secretary of state for war (1903-1905), and was\r\nthe author of numerous educational books published by Cassell & Co., of\r\nwhich firm he was a director.\r\n\r\nW.E. Forster gradually began to take an active part in public affairs by\r\nspeaking and lecturing. In 1858 he gave a lecture before the Leeds\r\nPhilosophical Institution on \"How we Tax India.\" In 1859 he stood as\r\nLiberal candidate for Leeds, but was beaten. But he was highly esteemed\r\nin the West Riding, and in 1861 he was returned unopposed for Bradford.\r\nIn 1865 (unopposed) and in 1868 (at the head of the poll) he was again\r\nreturned. He took a prominent part in parliament in the debates on the\r\nAmerican Civil War, and in 1868 was made under-secretary for the\r\ncolonies in Earl Russell's ministry. It was then that he first became a\r\nprominent advocate of imperial federation. In 1866 his attitude on\r\nparliamentary reform attracted a good deal of attention. His speeches\r\nwere full of knowledge of the real condition of the people, and\r\ncontained something like an original programme of Radical legislation.\r\n\"We have other things to do,\" he said, \"besides extending the franchise.\r\nWe want to make Ireland loyal and contented; we want to get rid of\r\npauperism in this country; we want to fight against a class which is\r\nmore to be dreaded than the holders of a L7 franchise--I mean the\r\ndangerous class in our large towns. We want to see whether we cannot\r\nmake for the agricultural labourer some better hope than the workhouse\r\nin his old age. We want to have Old England as well taught as New\r\nEngland.\" In these words he heralded the education campaign which\r\noccupied the country for so many years afterwards. Directly the Reform\r\nBill had passed, the necessity of \"inducing our masters to learn their\r\nletters\" (in Robert Lowe's phrase) became pressing. Mr Forster and Mr\r\nCardwell, as private members in opposition, brought in Education Bills\r\nin 1867 and 1868; and in 1868, when the Liberal party returned to\r\noffice, Mr Forster was appointed vice-president of the council, with the\r\nduty of preparing a government measure for national education. The\r\nElementary Education Bill (see EDUCATION) was introduced on the 17th of\r\nFebruary 1870. The religious difficulty at once came to the front. The\r\nManchester Education Union and the Birmingham Education League had\r\nalready formulated in the provinces the two opposing theories, the\r\nformer standing for the preservation of denominational interests, the\r\nlatter advocating secular rate-aided education as the only means of\r\nprotecting Nonconformity against the Church. The Dissenters were by no\r\nmeans satisfied with Forster's \"conscience clause\" as contained in the\r\nbill, and they regarded him, the ex-Quaker, as a deserter from their own\r\nside; while they resented the \"25th clause,\" permitting school boards to\r\npay the fees of needy children at denominational schools out of the\r\nrates, as an insidious attack upon themselves. By the 14th of March,\r\nwhen the second reading came on, the controversy had assumed threatening\r\nproportions; and Mr Dixon, the Liberal member for Birmingham and\r\nchairman of the Education League, moved an amendment, the effect of\r\nwhich was to prohibit all religious education in board schools. The\r\ngovernment made its rejection a question of confidence, and the\r\namendment was withdrawn; but the result was the insertion of the\r\nCowper-Temple clause as a compromise before the bill passed. Extremists\r\non both sides abused Forster, but the government had a difficult set of\r\ncircumstances to deal with, and he acted like a prudent statesman in\r\ncontenting himself with what he could get. An ideal bill was\r\nimpracticable; it is to Forster's enduring credit that the bill of 1870,\r\nimperfect as it was, established at last some approach to a system of\r\nnational education in England without running absolutely counter to the\r\nmost cherished English ideas and without ignoring the principal agencies\r\nalready in existence.\r\n\r\nForster's next important work was in passing the Ballot Act of 1872, but\r\nfor several years afterwards his life was uneventful. In 1874 he was\r\nagain returned for Bradford, in spite of Dissenting attacks, and he took\r\nhis full share of the work of the Opposition Front Bench. In 1875, when\r\nMr Gladstone \"retired,\" he was strongly supported for the leadership of\r\nthe Liberal party, but declined to be nominated against Lord Harrington.\r\nIn the same year he was elected F.R.S., and made lord rector of Aberdeen\r\nUniversity. In 1876, when the Eastern question was looming large, he\r\nvisited Servia and Turkey, and his subsequent speeches on the subject\r\nwere marked by studious moderation, distasteful to extremists on both\r\nsides. On Mr Gladstone's return to office in 1880 he was made chief\r\nsecretary for Ireland, with Lord Cowper as lord-lieutenant. He carried\r\nthe Compensation for Disturbance Bill through the Commons, only to see\r\nit thrown out in the Lords, and his task was made more difficult by the\r\nagitation which arose in consequence. During the gloomy autumn and\r\nwinter of 1880-1881 Forster's energy and devotion in grappling with the\r\nsituation in Ireland (see IRELAND) were indefatigable, his labour was\r\nenormous, and the personal risks he ran were many; but he enjoyed the\r\nIrish character in spite of all obstacles, and inspired genuine\r\nadmiration in all his coadjutors. On the 24th of January 1881 he\r\nintroduced a new Coercion Bill in the House of Commons, to deal with the\r\ngrowth of the Land League, and in the course of his speech declared it\r\nto be \"the most painful duty\" he had ever had to perform, and one which\r\nwould have prevented his accepting his office if he had known that it\r\nwould fall upon him. The bill passed, among its provisions being one\r\nenabling the Irish government to arrest without trial persons\r\n\"reasonably suspected\" of crime and conspiracy. The Irish party used\r\nevery opportunity in and out of parliament for resenting this act, and\r\nForster was kept constantly on the move between Dublin and London,\r\nconducting his campaign against crime and anarchy and defending it in\r\nthe House of Commons. His scrupulous conscientiousness and anxiety to\r\nmeet every reasonable claim availed him nothing with such antagonists,\r\nand the strain was intense and continuous. He was nicknamed \"Buckshot\"\r\nby the Nationalist press, on the supposition that he had ordered its use\r\nby the police when firing on a crowd. On the 13th of October Mr Parnell\r\nwas arrested, and on the 20th the Land League was proclaimed. From that\r\ntime Forster's life was in constant danger, and he had to be escorted by\r\nmounted police when he drove in Dublin. Early in March 1882 he visited\r\nsome of the worst districts in Ireland, and addressed the crowd at\r\nTullamore on the subject of outrages, denouncing the people for their\r\nwant of courage in not assisting the government, but adding, \"whether\r\nyou do or not, it is the duty of the government to stop the outrages,\r\nand stop them we will.\" Forster's pluck in speaking out like this was\r\nfully appreciated in England, but it was not till after the revelations\r\nconnected with the Phoenix Park murders that the dangers he had\r\nconfronted were properly realized, and it became known that several\r\nplans to murder him had only been frustrated by the merest accidents. On\r\nthe 2nd of May Mr Gladstone announced that the government intended to\r\nrelease Mr Parnell and his fellow-prisoners in Kilmainham, and that both\r\nLord Cowper and Mr Forster had in consequence resigned; and the\r\nfollowing Saturday Forster's successor, Lord Frederick Cavendish, was,\r\nwith Mr Burke, murdered in Phoenix Park. It was characteristic of the\r\nman that Forster at once offered to go back to Dublin temporarily as\r\nchief secretary, but the offer was declined. His position naturally\r\nattracted universal attention towards him, particularly during the\r\ndebates which ensued in parliament on the \"Kilmainham Treaty.\" But Mr\r\nGladstone's influence with the Liberal party was paramount, in spite of\r\nthe damaging appearance of the compact made with Parnell, and Forster's\r\npointed criticisms only caused thoroughgoing partisans to accuse him of\r\na desire to avenge himself. It was not till the next session that he\r\ndelivered his fiercest attack on Parnell in the debate on the address,\r\ndenouncing him for his connexion with the Land League, and quoting\r\nagainst him the violent speeches of his supporters and the articles of\r\nhis newspaper organs. It was on this occasion that Parnell, on Forster's\r\ncharging him, not with directly planning or perpetrating outrages or\r\nmurder, but with conniving at them, ejaculated \"It's a lie\"; and,\r\nreplying on the next day, the Irish leader, instead of disproving\r\nForster's charges, bitterly denounced his methods of administration.\r\nThough, during the few remaining years of his life, Forster's political\r\nrecord covered various interesting subjects, his connexion with these\r\nstormy times in Ireland throws them all into shadow. He died on the 6th\r\nof April 1886, on the eve of the introduction of the Home Rule Bill, to\r\nwhich he was stoutly opposed. In the interval there had been other\r\nquestions on which he found himself at variance with Gladstonian\r\nLiberalism, for instance, as regards the Sudan and the Transvaal, nor\r\nwas he inclined to stomach the claims of the Caucus or the Birmingham\r\nprogramme. When the Redistribution Act divided Bradford into three\r\nconstituencies, Forster was returned for the central division, but he\r\nnever took his seat in the new parliament.\r\n\r\nForster, like John Bright, was an excellent representative of the\r\nEnglish middle-class in public life. Patriotic, energetic, independent,\r\nincorruptible, shrewd, fair-minded, he was endowed not only with great\r\nsympathy with progress, but also with a full faculty for resistance to\r\nmere democraticism. He was tall (the Yorkshiremen called him \"Long\r\nForster\") and strongly though stiffly built, and, with his simple tastes\r\nand straightforward manners and methods, was a typical North-country\r\nfigure. His oratory was rough and unpolished, but full of freshness and\r\nforce and genuine feeling. It was Forster who, when appealing to the\r\ngovernment at the time of Gordon's danger at Khartum, spoke of Mr\r\nGladstone as able \"to persuade most people of most things, and himself\r\nof almost anything,\" and though the phrase was much resented by Mr\r\nGladstone's _entourage_, the truth that underlay it may be taken as\r\nrepresenting the very converse of his own character. His personal\r\ndifficulties with some of his colleagues, both in regard to the\r\nEducation Act of 1870 and his Irish administration, must be properly\r\nunderstood if a complete comprehension of his political career is to be\r\nobtained. For an account of them we need only refer to the _Life of the\r\nRight Hon. W.E. Forster_, by Sir T. Wemyss Reid.     (H. Ch.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSYTH, PETER TAYLOR (1848- ), British Nonconformist divine, was born\r\nat Aberdeen in 1848. He took first-class honours in classics at\r\nAberdeen, subsequently studied at Gottingen (under Ritschl) and at New\r\nCollege, Hampstead, and entered the Congregational ministry. Having held\r\npastorates at Shipley, Hackney, Manchester, Leicester and Cambridge, he\r\nbecame principal of Hackney Theological College, Hampstead, in 1901. In\r\n1907 he delivered the Lyman Beecher lectures on preaching at Yale\r\nUniversity, published as _Positive Preaching and Modern Mind_. Among his\r\nother publications may be mentioned _Religion in Recent Art_, and\r\narticles in the _Contemporary Review_, _Hibbert Journal_, and _London\r\nQuarterly_. He was chairman of the Congregational Union of England and\r\nWales in 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTALEZA (usually called CEARA by foreigners), a city and port of\r\nBrazil and the capital of the state of Ceara, on a crescent-shaped\r\nindentation of the coast-line immediately W. of Cape Mucuripe or\r\nMocoripe, 7-1/2 m. from the mouth of the Ceara river, in lat. 3 deg. 42'\r\nS., long. 38 deg. 30' W. Pop. (1890) of the municipality, including a\r\nlarge rural district, 40,902. The city stands on an open sandy plain\r\noverlooking the sea, and is regularly laid out, with broad, well-paved,\r\ngas-lighted streets and numerous squares. Owing to the aridity of the\r\nclimate the vegetation is less luxuriant than in most Brazilian cities.\r\nThe temperature is usually high, but it is modified by the strong sea\r\nwinds. Fortaleza has suffered much from epidemics of yellow-fever,\r\nsmall-pox and beri-beri, but the climate is considered to be healthy. A\r\nsmall branch of the Ceara river, called the Pajehu, traverses the city\r\nand divides it into two parts, that on its right bank being locally\r\nknown as Outeiro. Fortaleza is the see of a bishopric, created in 1854,\r\nbut it has no cathedral, one of its ten churches being used for that\r\npurpose. Its public buildings include the government house, legislative\r\nchambers, bishop's palace, an episcopal seminary, a lyceum (high\r\nschool), Misericordia hospital, and asylums for mendicants and the\r\ninsane. The custom-house stands nearer the seashore, 1-3/4 m. from the\r\nrailway station in the city, with which it is connected by rail. The\r\nport is the principal outlet for the products of the state, but its\r\nanchorage is an open roadstead, one of the most dangerous on the\r\nnorthern coast of Brazil, and all ships are compelled to anchor well out\r\nfrom shore and discharge into lighters. Port improvements designed by\r\nthe eminent engineer Sir John Hawkshaw have been under construction for\r\nmany years, but have made very slow progress. The Baturite railway,\r\nbuilt by the national government partly to give employment to starving\r\nrefugees in times of long-continued droughts, connects the city and its\r\nport with fertile regions to the S.W., and extends to Senador Pompeu,\r\n178 m. distant. The exports include sugar, coffee, rubber, cotton, rum,\r\nrice, beans, fruits, hides and skins.\r\n\r\nFortaleza had its origin in a small village adjoining a fort established\r\nat this point in early colonial times. In 1654 it took the name of Villa\r\ndo Forte da Assumpca, but it was generally spoken of as Fortaleza. In\r\n1810 it became the capital of Ceara, and in 1823 it was raised to the\r\ndignity of a city under the title of Fortaleza da Nova Braganca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT AUGUSTUS, a village of Inverness-shire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 706.\r\nIt is delightfully situated at the south-western extremity of Loch Ness,\r\nabout 30 m. S.W. of Inverness, on the rivers Oich and Tarff and the\r\nCaledonian Canal. A branch line connects with Spean Bridge on the West\r\nHighland railway via Invergarry. The fort, then called Kilchumin, was\r\nbuilt in 1716 for the purpose of keeping the Highlanders in check, and\r\nwas enlarged in 1730 by General Wade. It was captured by the Jacobites\r\nin 1745, but reoccupied after the battle of Culloden, when it received\r\nits present name in honour of William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, the\r\nvictorious general. The fort was used as a sanatorium until 1857, when\r\nit was bought by the 12th Lord Lovat, whose son presented it in 1876 to\r\nthe English order of Benedictines. Within four years there rose upon its\r\nsite a pile of stately buildings under the title of St Benedict's Abbey\r\nand school, a monastic and collegiate institution intended for the\r\nhigher education of the sons of the Roman Catholic nobility and gentry.\r\nThe series of buildings consists of the college, monastery, hospice and\r\nscriptorium--the four forming a quadrangle connected by beautiful\r\ncloisters. Amongst its benefactors were many Catholic Scots and English\r\npeers and gentlemen whose arms are emblazoned on the windows of the\r\nspacious refectory hall. The summit of the college tower is 110 ft.\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT DODGE, a city and the county-seat of Webster county, Iowa, U.S.A.,\r\non the Des Moines river, 85 m. (by rail) N. by W. from Des Moines. Pop.\r\n(1890) 4871; (1900) 12,162; (1905, state census) 14,369, (2269 being\r\nforeign-born); (1910) 15,543. It is served by the Illinois Central, the\r\nChicago Great Western, the Minneapolis & Saint Louis, and the Fort\r\nDodge, Des Moines & Southern railways, the last an electric interurban\r\nline. Eureka Springs and Wild Cat Cave are of interest to visitors, and\r\nattractive scenery is furnished by the river and its bordering bluffs.\r\nThe river is here spanned by the Chicago Great Western railway steel\r\nbridge, or viaduct, one of the longest in the country. Fort Dodge is the\r\nseat of Tobin College (420 students in 1907-1908), a commercial and\r\nbusiness school, with preparatory, normal and classical departments, and\r\ncourses in oratory and music; among its other institutions are St Paul's\r\nschool (Evangelical Lutheran), two Roman Catholic schools, Corpus\r\nChristi Academy and the Sacred Heart school, Our Lady of Lourdes convent\r\nand a Carnegie library. Oleson Park and Reynold's Park are the city's\r\nprincipal parks. Immediately surrounding Fort Dodge is a rich farming\r\ncountry. To the E. of the city lies a gypsum bed, extending over an area\r\nof about 50 sq. m., and considered to be the most valuable in the United\r\nStates; to the S. coal abounds; there are also limestone quarries and\r\ndeposits of clay in the vicinity--the clay being, for the most part,\r\nobtained by mining. Fort Dodge is a market for the products of the\r\nsurrounding country, and is a shipping centre of considerable\r\nimportance. It has various manufactures, including gypsum, plaster,\r\noatmeal, brick and tile, sewer pipe, pottery, foundry and machine-shop\r\nproducts, and shoes. In 1905 the value of all the factory products was\r\n$3,025,659, an increase of 200.8% over that for 1900. Fort Clark was\r\nerected on the site in 1850 to protect settlers against the Indians; in\r\n1851 the name was changed by order of the secretary of war to Fort Dodge\r\nin honour of Colonel Henry Dodge (1782-1867), who was a\r\nlieutenant-colonel of Missouri Volunteers in the War of 1812, served\r\nwith distinction as a colonel of Michigan Mounted Volunteers in the\r\nBlack Hawk War, resigned from the military service in March 1833, was\r\ngovernor of Wisconsin Territory from 1836 to 1841 and from 1846 to 1848,\r\nand was a delegate from Wisconsin Territory to Congress from 1841 to\r\n1845, and a United States senator from Wisconsin in 1848-1857. The fort\r\nwas abandoned in 1853, and in 1854 a town was laid out. It was chartered\r\nas a city in 1869. From the gypsum beds near Fort Dodge was taken in\r\n1868 the block of gypsum from which was modelled the \"Cardiff Giant,\" a\r\nrudely-fashioned human figure, which was buried near Cardiff, Onondaga\r\ncounty, New York, where it was \"discovered\" late in 1869. It was then\r\nexhibited in various parts of the country as a \"petrified man.\" The hoax\r\nwas finally exposed by Professor Othniel C. Marsh of Yale; and George\r\nHall of Binghamton, N.Y., confessed to the fraud, his object having been\r\nto discredit belief in the \"giants\" of Genesis vi. 4. (See \"The Cardiff\r\nGiant: the True Story of a Remarkable Deception,\" by Andrew D. White, in\r\nthe _Century Magazine_, vol. xlii., 1902.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT EDWARD, a village of Washington county, New York, U.S.A., in the\r\ntownship of Fort Edward, on the Hudson river, 56 m. by rail N. of\r\nAlbany. Pop. of the village (1900) 3521, of whom 385 were foreign-born;\r\n(1905) 3806; (1910) 3762; of the township, including the village\r\n(1900), 5216; (1905), 5300; (1910), 5740. The village lies mostly at the\r\nfoot of a steep hill, is at the junction of the main line and the Glens\r\nFalls branch of the Delaware & Hudson railway, and is also served by\r\nelectric line to Albany and Glens Falls; the barge canal connecting Lake\r\nChamplain and the Hudson river enters the Hudson here. The river\r\nfurnishes good water-power, which is used in the manufacture of paper\r\nand wood pulp, the leading industry. Shirts and pottery (flower pots,\r\njars and drain tile) are manufactured also. The village is the seat of\r\nthe Fort Edward Collegiate Institute, a non-sectarian school for girls,\r\nwhich was founded in 1854 and until 1893 was coeducational. The village\r\nowns and operates the waterworks. Indian war parties on their way to\r\nCanada were accustomed to make a portage from this place, the head of\r\nnavigation for small boats on the Hudson, to Lake George or Lake\r\nChamplain, and hence it was known as the Great Carrying Place. Governor\r\n(afterwards Sir) Francis Nicholson in 1709, in his expedition against\r\nCanada, built here a stockade which was named Fort Nicholson. Some years\r\nafterwards John Henry Lydius (1693-1791) established a settlement and\r\nprotected it by a new fort, named Fort Lydius, but this was destroyed by\r\nthe French and Indians in 1745. In 1755, a third fort was built by\r\nGeneral Phineas Lyman (1716-1774), as preliminary to the expedition\r\nagainst Crown Point under General William Johnson, and was named Fort\r\nLyman; in 1756 Johnson renamed it Fort Edward in honour of Edward, Duke\r\nof York. In the War for Independence Fort Edward was the headquarters of\r\nGeneral Philip Schuyler while he and his troops were blocking the march\r\nof General Burgoyne's army from Fort Ticonderoga. When a part of\r\nBurgoyne's forces was distant only 3 or 4 m. from Fort Edward, on Fort\r\nEdward Hill, on the 27th of July 1777, the leader of an Indian band\r\nwhose assistance the British had sought is supposed to have murdered\r\nJane McCrea (c. 1757-1777), a young-girl who had been visiting friends\r\nin Fort Edward, and who was to be escorted on that day to the British\r\ncamp and there to be married to David Jones, a loyalist serving as a\r\nlieutenant in Burgoyne's army; it is possible that she was shot\r\naccidentally by Americans pursuing her Indian escorts, but her death did\r\nmuch to rouse local sentiment against Burgoyne and his Indian allies,\r\nand caused many volunteers to join the American army resisting\r\nBurgoyne's invasion. A monument has been erected by the Jane McCrea\r\nChapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution near the spot where\r\nshe was killed, and she is buried in Union Cemetery in Fort Edward. Fort\r\nEdward township was erected in 1818 from a part of the township of\r\nArgyle. Fort Edward village was incorporated in 1852.\r\n\r\n  See R.O. Bascom, _The Fort Edward Book_ (Fort Edward, 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTESCUE, SIR JOHN (c. 1394-c. 1476), English lawyer, the second son of\r\nSir John Fortescue, of an ancient family in Devonshire, was born at\r\nNorris, near South Brent, in Somersetshire. He was educated at Exeter\r\nCollege, Oxford. During the reign of Henry VI. he was three times\r\nappointed one of the governors of Lincoln's Inn. In 1441 he was made a\r\nking's sergeant at law, and in the following year chief justice of the\r\nking's bench. As a judge Fortescue is highly recommended for his wisdom,\r\ngravity and uprightness; and he seems to have enjoyed great favour with\r\nthe king, who is said to have given him some substantial proofs of\r\nesteem and regard. He held his office during the remainder of the reign\r\nof Henry VI., to whom he steadily adhered; and having faithfully served\r\nthat unfortunate monarch in all his troubles, he was attainted of\r\ntreason in the first parliament of Edward IV. When Henry subsequently\r\nfled into Scotland, he is supposed to have appointed Fortescue, who\r\nappears to have accompanied him in his flight, chancellor of England. In\r\n1463 Fortescue accompanied Queen Margaret and her court in their exile\r\non the Continent, and returned with them afterwards to England. During\r\ntheir wanderings abroad the chancellor wrote for the instruction of the\r\nyoung prince Edward his celebrated work _De laudibus legum Angliae_. On\r\nthe defeat of the Lancastrian party he made his submission to Edward\r\nIV., from whom he received a general pardon dated Westminster, October\r\n13, 1471. He died at an advanced age, but the exact date of his death\r\nhas not been ascertained.\r\n\r\n  Fortescue's masterly vindication of the laws of England, though\r\n  received with great favour by the learned of the profession to whom it\r\n  was communicated, did not appear in print until the reign of Henry\r\n  VIII., when it was published, but without a date. It was subsequently\r\n  many times reprinted. Another valuable and learned work by Fortescue,\r\n  written in English, was published in 1714, under the title of _The\r\n  Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy_. In the Cotton\r\n  library there is a manuscript of this work, in the title of which it\r\n  is said to have been addressed to Henry VI.; but many passages show\r\n  plainly that it was written in favour of Edward IV. A revised edition\r\n  of this work, with a very valuable historical and biographical\r\n  introduction, was published in 1885 by Charles Plummer, under the\r\n  title _The Governance of England_. All of Fortescue's minor writings\r\n  appear in _The Works of Sir John Fortescue, now first Collected and\r\n  Arranged_, published in 1869 for private circulation, by his\r\n  descendant, Lord Clermont.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Plummer's Introduction to _The Governance of England_;\r\n  _Life_ in Lord Clermont's edition; Gairdner's _Paston Letters_; Foss's\r\n  _Lives of the Judges_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTESCUE, SIR JOHN (c. 1531-1607), English statesman, was the eldest\r\nson of Sir Adrian Fortescue (executed in 1539), and of his second wife,\r\nAnne, daughter of Sir William Reade or Rede of Borstall in\r\nBuckinghamshire. The exact date of his birth is unrecorded.[1] He was\r\nrestored in blood and to his estate at Shirburn in Oxfordshire in 1551.\r\nThrough his father's mother, Alice, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, he\r\nwas a second cousin once removed from Queen Elizabeth. He acquired early\r\na considerable reputation as a scholar and was chosen to direct the\r\nPrincess Elizabeth's classical studies in Mary's reign. On the accession\r\nof Elizabeth he was appointed keeper of the great wardrobe. He was\r\nreturned in 1572 to parliament for Wallingford, in 1586 for Buckingham\r\nborough, in 1588 and 1597 for Buckingham county, and in 1601 for\r\nMiddlesex. In 1589 he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer and a\r\nmember of the privy council. In 1592 he was knighted, and in November\r\n1601, in addition to his two great offices, he received that of\r\nchancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. By means of his lucrative\r\nemployments he amassed great wealth, with which he bought large estates\r\nin Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and kept up much state and a large\r\nhousehold. He took a prominent part in public business, was a member of\r\nthe court of the star chamber and an ecclesiastical commissioner, sat on\r\nvarious important commissions, and as chancellor of the exchequer\r\nexplained the queen's financial needs and proposed subsidies in\r\nparliament. On the death of Elizabeth he suggested that certain\r\nrestrictions should be imposed on James's powers, in order probably to\r\nlimit the appointment of Scotchmen to office,[2] but his advice was not\r\nfollowed. He was deprived by James of the chancellorship of the\r\nexchequer, but evidently did not forfeit his favour, as he retained his\r\ntwo other offices and entertained James several times at Henden and\r\nSalden. In 1604 Sir John, who stood for Buckinghamshire, was defeated by\r\nSir Francis Goodwin, whose election, however, was declared void by the\r\nlord chancellor on the ground of a sentence of outlawry under which he\r\nlay, and Fortescue was by a second election returned in his place. This\r\nincident gave rise to a violent controversy, regarding the chancellor's\r\njurisdiction in deciding disputed elections to parliament, which was\r\nrepudiated by the Commons but maintained by the king. The matter after\r\nmuch debate was ended by a compromise, which, while leaving the\r\nprinciple unsettled, set aside the elections of both candidates and\r\nprovided for the issue of a new writ. Fortescue was then in February\r\n1606 returned for Middlesex, which he represented till his death on the\r\n23rd of December 1607. He was buried in Mursley church in\r\nBuckinghamshire, where a monument was erected to his memory. His long\r\npublic career was highly honourable, and he served his sovereign and\r\ncountry with unswerving fidelity and honesty. His learned attainments\r\ntoo were considerable--Camden styles him \"vir integer, Graece,\r\nLatineque apprime eruditus,\"[3] and his scholarship is also praised by\r\nLloyd, while his friendship with Sir Thomas Bodley procured gifts of\r\nbooks and manuscripts to the latter's library. Fortescue married (1)\r\nCecily, daughter of Sir Edmund Ashfield of Ewelme, by whom, besides a\r\ndaughter, he had two sons, Sir Francis and Sir William; and (2) Alice,\r\ndaughter of Christopher Smyth of Annabels in Hertfordshire, by whom he\r\nhad one daughter. His descent in the male line became extinct with the\r\ndeath of Sir John Fortescue, 3rd baronet, in 1717.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Article in the _Dict. of Nat.

S.W. of Perth. Pop. of\r\nparish (1901) 562. It is a place of remote antiquity, having been a\r\ncapital of the Picts, when the district was known as Fortrenn, and\r\nafterwards of the Scots. The army led by Edward Baliol camped here\r\nbefore the battle of Dupplin (1332), in which the regent, Donald, earl\r\nof Mar, was slain along with 13,000 out of 30,000 men. The parish of\r\nFindo-Gask adjoining it on the N.W. contains remains of a Roman road,\r\nstation and outpost, besides the \"auld hoose\" of Gask in which the\r\nBaroness Nairne was born, and which forms the theme of one of her most\r\npopular songs. The new house in which she died dates from 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT GEORGE, a military station of Inverness-shire, Scotland. It lies 12\r\nm. N.E. of Inverness, and is the terminus of the small branch line\r\nconnecting with the Highland railway at Gollanfield junction. It\r\noccupies a sandy promontory forming the extreme end of the southern\r\nshore of Inner Moray Firth (also called the Firth of Inverness), which\r\nis here only 1 m. wide. There is communication by ferry with Fortrose on\r\nthe opposite coast of the Black Isle. The fort was begun in 1748, partly\r\nafter the plan of one of Vauban's works, and named in honour of George\r\nII. Wolfe, who saw it in course of erection in 1751, was much impressed\r\nwith it and thought it would, when finished, be \"the most considerable\r\nfortress and best situated in Great Britain.\" It covers 16 acres and\r\ncontains accommodation for nearly 2200 men. It is the depot of the\r\nSeaforth Highlanders, and a military training-ground of some size and\r\nimportance because the surrounding country gives ample facilities for\r\nexercise and manoeuvres. General Wade's road is maintained in good\r\norder. Fort George, it is said, had almost been chosen as the place of\r\ndetention for Napoleon when the claims of St Helena were put forward.\r\nAbout 2 m. S.E. is the fishing village of Campbelltown, in growing\r\nrepute as a seaside resort. Midway between the fort and Inverness stands\r\nCastle Stuart, a shooting-box of the earl of Moray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTH, a river and firth of the east of Scotland. The river is formed by\r\ntwo head streams, Duchray Water (12 m.) and Avondhu (10 m.), or Laggan\r\nas it is called after it leaves Loch Ard, both rising in the north-east\r\nof Ben Lomond in Stirlingshire, and uniting 1 m. west of Aberfoyle. From\r\nthis point till it receives the Kelty, the Forth continues to be a\r\nPerthshire stream, but afterwards it becomes the dividing line between\r\nthe counties of Perth and Stirling as far as the confluence of the\r\nAllan. Thence it belongs to Stirlingshire to a point 1-1/2 m. due west of\r\nCambus, whence it serves as the boundary between the shires of Stirling\r\nand Clackmannan. Owing to the extremely tortuous character of its course\r\nbetween Gartmore and Alloa--the famous \"links of the Forth,\"--the actual\r\nlength of the river is 66 m., or nearly double the distance in a direct\r\nline (30 m.) between the source of the Duchray and Kincardine, where the\r\nfirth begins. The river drains an area of 645 sq. m. Its general\r\ndirection is mainly easterly with a gentle trend towards the south, and\r\nthe principal tributaries on the left are the Goodie, Teith, Allan and\r\nDevon, and on the right, the Kelty, Boquhan and Bannock. The alluvial\r\nplain extending from Gartmore to the county town is called the Carse of\r\nStirling. The places of interest on the banks are Aberfoyle, Kippen,\r\nStirling, Cambuskenneth, Alloa and Kincardine, but after it crosses the\r\nHighland line the Forth does not present many passages of remarkable\r\nbeauty. There are bridges at Aberfoyle, Gartmore, Frew, Drip and\r\nStirling (2), besides railway viaducts at Stirling and Alloa, and there\r\nare ferries at Stirling (for Cambuskenneth), Alloa (for South Alloa) and\r\nKincardine (for Airth). The tide rises to 4-1/2 m. above Stirling, where\r\nthe river is navigable at high water by vessels of 100 tons. There is,\r\nhowever, a brisk shipping trade at Alloa, where the dock accommodates\r\nvessels of at least 300 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Firth of Forth extends from Kincardine to the North Sea, that is, to\r\nan imaginary line drawn, just west of the Isle of May, from the East\r\nNeuk of Fife to the mouth of the Tyne in Haddingtonshire--a distance of\r\n48 m. Thus, according to some calculations, the Forth measures from\r\nsource to sea 114 m. The width of the firth varies from 1/2 m. at\r\nKincardine and 1-1/2 m. at Queensferry to 6-1/2 m. at Leith and 17-1/2\r\nm. at the mouth. The chief affluents are, on the south, the Carron,\r\nAvon, Almond, Leith, Esk and Tyne, and on the north, the Tiel, Leven,\r\nKiel and Dreel. The principal ports on the south shore are Grangemouth,\r\nBo'ness, Granton and Leith, and on the north, Burntisland and Kirkcaldy;\r\nbut fishery centres and holiday resorts are very numerous on both\r\ncoasts. Since the opening of the Forth Bridge (see Bridges) in 1890 the\r\nferries at Queensferry and Burntisland have greatly diminished in\r\nimportance. The fisheries are still considerable, though the oyster\r\ntrade is dwindling. The larger islands are Inchcolm, with the ruins of\r\nan abbey, Inchkeith, with fortifications and a lighthouse, and the Isle\r\nof May, with a lighthouse. The anchorage of St Margaret's Hope, with the\r\nnaval base of Rosyth, lies off the shore of Fife immediately to the west\r\nof the Forth Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe Forth was the _Bodotria_ of Tacitus and the Scots Water of the\r\nchroniclers of the 11th and 12th centuries; while Bede (d. 735) knew the\r\nfirth as _Sinus orientalis_ (the Eastern Gulf), and Nennius (fl. 796) as\r\n_Mare Friesicum_ (the Frisian Sea).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTIFICATION AND SIEGECRAFT. \"Fortification\" is the military art of\r\nstrengthening positions against attack. The word (Lat. _fortis_, strong,\r\nand _facere_, to make) implies the creation of defences. Thus the boy\r\nwho from the top of a mound defies his comrades, or shelters from their\r\nsnowballs behind a fence, is merely taking advantage of ground; but if\r\nhe puts up a hurdle on his mound and stands behind that he has fortified\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\nFortification consists of two elements, viz. _protection_ and\r\n_obstacle_. The protection shields the defender from the enemy's\r\nmissiles; the obstacle prevents the enemy from coming to close quarters,\r\nand delays him under fire.\r\n\r\n_Protection_ may be of several kinds, direct or indirect. Direct\r\nprotection is given by a wall or rampart of earth, strong enough to stop\r\nthe enemy's missiles. The value of this is reduced in proportion as the\r\ndefender has to expose himself to return the enemy's fire, or to resist\r\nhis attempts to destroy the defences. Indirect protection is given by\r\n_distance_, as for instance by a high wall placed on a cliff so that the\r\ndefender on the top of the wall is out of reach of the enemy's missiles\r\nif these are of short range, such as arrows. This kind of defence was\r\nvery popular in the middle ages. In the present day the same object is\r\nattained by pushing out detached forts to such a distance from the town\r\nthey are protecting that the besieger cannot bombard the town as long as\r\nhe is outside the forts. Another form of indirect protection of great\r\nimportance is concealment.\r\n\r\nThe _obstacle_ may consist of anything which will impede the enemy's\r\nadvance and prevent him from coming to close quarters. In the earliest\r\nforms of fortification the protecting wall was also the obstacle, or it\r\nmay be a wet or dry ditch, an entanglement, a swamp, a thorn hedge, a\r\nspiked palisade, or some temporary expedient, such as crows' feet or\r\nchevaux de frise. The two elements must of course be arranged in\r\ncombination. The besieged must be able to defend the obstacle from their\r\nprotected position, otherwise it can be surmounted or destroyed at\r\nleisure. But a close connexion is no longer essential. The effect of\r\nmodern firearms permits of great elasticity in the disposition of the\r\nobstacle; and this simplifies some of the problems of defence.\r\n\r\nProtection must be arranged mainly with reference to the enemy's methods\r\nof attack and the weapons he uses. The obstacle, on the other hand,\r\nshould be of such a nature as to bring out the best effects of the\r\ndefender's weapons. It follows from this that a well-armed force\r\noperating against a badly-armed uncivilized enemy may use with advantage\r\nvery simple old-fashioned methods of protection; or even dispense with\r\nit altogether if the obstacle is a good one.\r\n\r\nWhen the assailant has modern weapons the importance of protection is\r\nvery great. In fact, it may be said that in proportion as missile\r\nweapons have grown more effective, the importance of protection and the\r\ndifficulty of providing it have increased, while the necessity for a\r\nmonumental physical obstacle has decreased.\r\n\r\nThe art of the engineer who is about to fortify consists in appreciating\r\nand harmonizing all the conditions of the problem, such as the weapons\r\nin use, nature of the ground, materials available, temper of assailants\r\nand defenders, strategical possibilities, expenditure to be incurred,\r\nand so forth. Few of these conditions are in themselves difficult to\r\nunderstand, but they are so many and their reactions are so complex that\r\na real familiarity with all of them is essential to successful work. The\r\nkeynote of the solution should be simplicity; but this is the first\r\npoint usually lost sight of by the makers of \"systems,\" especially by\r\nthose who during a long period of peace have time to give play to their\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nFortification is usually divided into two branches, namely _permanent\r\nfortification_ and _field fortification_. Permanent fortifications are\r\nerected at leisure, with all the resources that a state can supply of\r\nconstructive and mechanical skill, and are built of enduring materials.\r\nField fortifications are extemporized by troops in the field, perhaps\r\nassisted by such local labour and tools as may be procurable, and with\r\nmaterials that do not require much preparation, such as earth, brushwood\r\nand light timber. There is also an intermediate branch known as\r\n_semi-permanent fortification_. This is employed when in the course of a\r\ncampaign it becomes desirable to protect some locality with the best\r\nimitation of permanent defences that can be made in a short time, ample\r\nresources and skilled civilian labour being available.\r\n\r\nThe _objects of fortification_ are various. The vast enceintes of\r\nNineveh and Babylon were planned so that in time of war they might give\r\nshelter to the whole population of the country except the field army,\r\nwith their flocks and herds and household stuff. The same idea may be\r\nseen to-day in the walls of such cities as Kano. In the middle ages\r\nfeudal lords built castles for security against the attacks of their\r\nneighbours, and also to watch over towns or bridges or fords from which\r\nthey drew revenue; whilst rich towns were surrounded with walls merely\r\nfor the protection of their own inhabitants and their property. The\r\nfeudal castles lost their importance when the art of cannon-founding was\r\nfairly developed; and in the leisurely wars of the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, when roads were few and bad, a swarm of fortified towns,\r\nlarge and small, played a great part in delaying the march of victorious\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nIn the present day isolated forts are seldom used, and only for such\r\npurposes as to block passes in mountainous districts. Fortresses are\r\nused either to protect points of vital importance, such as capital\r\ncities, military depots and dockyards, or at strategic points such as\r\nrailway junctions. Combinations of fortresses are also used for more\r\ngeneral strategic purposes, as will be explained later.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ancient methods.\r\n\r\nThe most elementary type of fortification is the thorn _hedge_, a type\r\nwhich naturally recurs from age to age under primitive conditions. Thus,\r\nAlexander found the villages of the Hyrcanians defended by thick hedges,\r\nand the same arrangements may be seen to-day among the least civilized\r\ntribes of Africa. The next advance from the hedge is the _bank_ of\r\nearth, with the exterior made steep by revetments of sods or\r\nhurdle-work. This has a double advantage over the hedge, as, besides\r\nbeing a better obstacle against assault, it gives the defenders an\r\nadvantage of position in a hand-to-hand fight. Such banks formed the\r\ndefences of the German towns in Caesar's time, and they were constructed\r\nwith a high degree of skill. Timber being plentiful, the parapets were\r\nbuilt of alternate layers of stones, earth and tree trunks. The latter\r\nwere built in at right angles to the length of the parapet, and were\r\nthus very difficult to displace, while the earth prevented their being\r\nset on fire. The bank was often strengthened by a palisade of tree\r\ntrunks or hurdle-work.\r\n\r\nAfter the bank the most important step in advance for a nation\r\nprogressing in the arts was the _wall_, of masonry, sun-dried brick or\r\nmud. The history of the development of the wall and of the methods of\r\nattacking it is the history of fortification for several thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe first necessity for the wall was height, to give security against\r\nescalade. The second-was thickness, so that the defenders might have a\r\nplatform on the top which would give them space to circulate freely and\r\nto use their weapons. A lofty wall, thick enough at the top for purposes\r\nof defence, would be very expensive if built of solid masonry; therefore\r\nthe plan was early introduced of building two walls with a filling of\r\nearth or rubble between them. The face of the outer wall would be\r\ncarried up a few feet above the platform, and crenellated to give\r\nprotection against arrows and other projectiles.\r\n\r\nThe next forward step for the defence was the construction of _towers_\r\nat intervals along the wall. These provided flanking fire along the\r\nfront; they also afforded refuges for the garrison in case of a\r\nsuccessful escalade, and from them the platform could be enfiladed.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the wall with towers was simple. The main requirements\r\nwere despotic power and unlimited labour. Thus the finest examples of\r\nthe system known to history are also amongst the earliest. One of these\r\nwas Nineveh, built more than 2000 years B.C. The object of its huge\r\nperimeter, more than 50 m., has been mentioned. The wall was 120 ft.\r\nhigh and 30 ft. thick; and there were 1500 towers.\r\n\r\nAfter this no practical advance in the art of fortification was made for\r\na very long time, from a constructional point of view. Many centuries\r\nindeed elapsed before the inventive genius of man evolved engines and\r\nmethods of attack fit to cope with such colossal obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of attack was of course _escalade_, either by ladders\r\nor by heaping up a ramp of faggots or other portable materials. When the\r\nincreasing height of walls made escalade too difficult, other means of\r\nattack had to be invented. Probably the first of these were the _ram_,\r\nfor battering down the walls, and _mining_. The latter might have two\r\nobjects: (a) to drive an underground gallery below the wall from the\r\nbesiegers' position into the fortress, or (b) to destroy the wall itself\r\nby undermining.\r\n\r\nThe use of missile _engines_ for throwing heavy projectiles probably\r\ncame later. They are mentioned in the preparations made for the defence\r\nof Jerusalem against the Philistines in the 8th century B.C. They are\r\nnot mentioned in connexion with the siege of Troy. At the sieges of Tyre\r\nand Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 587 B.C. we first find mention of the\r\nram and of movable towers placed on mounds to overlook the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Classical times.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatics, however, had not the qualities of mind necessary for a\r\nsystematic development of siegecraft, and it was left for the Greeks\r\npractically to create this science. Taking it up in the 5th century B.C.\r\nthey soon, under Philip of Macedon and Alexander, arrived at a very high\r\ndegree of skill. They invented and systematized methods which were\r\nafterwards perfected by the Romans. Alexander's siegecraft was extremely\r\npractical. His successors endeavoured to improve on it by increasing the\r\nsize of their missile and other engines, which, however, were so\r\ncumbrous that they were of little use. When the Romans a little later\r\ntook up the science they returned to the practical methods of Alexander,\r\nand by the time of Caesar's wars had become past-masters of it. The\r\nhighest development of siegecraft before the use of gunpowder was\r\nprobably attained in the early days of the Roman empire. The beginning\r\nof the Christian era is therefore a suitable period at which to take a\r\nsurvey of the arts of fortification and siegecraft as practised by the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conditions at opening of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n  In fortification the wall with towers was still the leading idea. The\r\n  towers were preferred circular in plan, as this form offered the best\r\n  resistance to the ram. The wall was usually reinforced by a ditch,\r\n  which had three advantages: it increased the height of the obstacle,\r\n  made the bringing up of the engines of attack more difficult, and\r\n  supplied material for the filling of the wall. In special cases, as at\r\n  Jerusalem and Rhodes, the enclosure walls were doubled and trebled.\r\n  Citadels were also built on a large scale.\r\n\r\n  The typical site preferred by the Romans for a fortified town was on\r\n  high ground sloping to a river on one side and with steep slopes\r\n  falling away on the other three sides. At the highest point was a\r\n  castle serving as citadel. The town enclosure was designed in\r\n  accordance with the character of the surrounding country. Where the\r\n  enemy's approach was easiest, the walls were higher, flanking towers\r\n  stronger and ditches wider and deeper. Some of the towers were made\r\n  high for look-out posts. If there was a bridge over the river, it was\r\n  defended by a bridge-head on the far side; and stockades defended by\r\n  towers were built out from either bank above and below the bridge,\r\n  between which chains or booms could be stretched to bar the passage.\r\n\r\n  The natural features of the ground were skilfully utilized. Thus when\r\n  a large town was spread over an irregular site broken by hills, the\r\n  enceinte wall would be carried over the top of the hills; and in the\r\n  intervening valleys the wall would not only be made stronger, but\r\n  would be somewhat drawn back to allow of a flanking defence from the\r\n  hill tops on either side. The walls would consist of two strong\r\n  masonry faces, 20 ft. apart, the space between filled with earth and\r\n  stones. Usually when the lie of the ground was favourable, the outside\r\n  of the wall would be much higher than the inside, the parapet walk\r\n  perhaps being but a little above the level of the town. Palisades were\r\n  used to strengthen the ditches, especially before the gates.\r\n\r\n  There was little scope, however, in masonry for the genius of Roman\r\n  warfare, which had a better opportunity in the active work of attack\r\n  and defence. For siegecraft the Roman legions were specially apt. No\r\n  modern engineer, civil or military, accustomed to rely on machinery,\r\n  steam and hydraulic apparatus, could hope to emulate the feats of the\r\n  legionaries. In earthworks they excelled; and in such work as building\r\n  and moving about colossal wooden towers under war conditions, they\r\n  accomplished things at which nowadays we can only wonder.\r\n\r\n  The attack was carried on mainly by the use of \"engines,\" under which\r\n  head were included all mechanical means of attack--towers, missile\r\n  engines such as catapults and balistae, rams of different kinds,\r\n  \"tortoises\" (see below), &c. Mining, too, was freely resorted to, also\r\n  approach trenches, the use of which had been introduced by the Greeks.\r\n\r\n  The object of mining, as has been said, might be the driving of a\r\n  gallery under the wall into the interior of the place, or the\r\n  destruction of the wall. The latter was effected by excavating large\r\n  chambers under the foundations. These were supported while the\r\n  excavation was proceeding by timber struts and planking. When the\r\n  chambers were large enough the timber supports were burnt and the wall\r\n  collapsed. The besieged replied to the mining attack by countermines.\r\n  With these they would undermine and destroy the besiegers' galleries,\r\n  or would break into them and drive out the workers, either by force of\r\n  arms or by filling the galleries with smoke.\r\n\r\n  Breaches in the wall were made by rams. These were of two kinds. For\r\n  dislodging the cemented masonry of the face of the wall, steel-pointed\r\n  heads were used; when this was done, another head, shaped like a ram's\r\n  head, was substituted for battering down the filling of the wall.\r\n\r\n  For escalade they used ladders fixed on wheeled platforms; but the\r\n  most important means of attack against a high wall were the movable\r\n  towers of wood. These were built so high that from their tops the\r\n  parapet walk of the wall could be swept with arrows and stones; and\r\n  drawbridges were let down from them, by which a storming party could\r\n  reach the top of the wall. The height of the towers was from 70 to 150\r\n  ft. They were moved on wheels of solid oak or elm, 6 to 12 ft. in\r\n  diameter and 3 to 4 ft. thick. The ground floor contained one or two\r\n  rams. The upper floors, of which there might be as many as fifteen,\r\n  were furnished with missile engines of a smaller kind. The archers\r\n  occupied the top floor. There also were placed reservoirs of water to\r\n  extinguish fire. These were filled by force pumps and fitted with hose\r\n  made of the intestines of cattle. Drawbridges, either hanging or\r\n  worked on rollers, were placed at the proper height to give access to\r\n  the top of the wall, or to a breach, as might be required. Apollodorus\r\n  proposed to place a couple of rams in the upper part of the tower to\r\n  destroy the crenellations of the wall.\r\n\r\n  The siege towers had of course to be very solidly built of strong\r\n  timbers to resist the heavy stones thrown by the engines of the\r\n  defence. They were protected against fire by screens of osiers,\r\n  plaited rope or raw hides. Sometimes it was necessary, in order to\r\n  gain greater height, to place them on high terraces of earth. In that\r\n  case they would be built on the site. At the siege of Marseilles,\r\n  described by Caesar, special methods of attack had to be employed on\r\n  account of the strength of the engines used by the besieged and their\r\n  frequent sallies to destroy the siege works. A square fort, with brick\r\n  walls 30 ft. long and 5 ft. thick, was built in front of one of the\r\n  towers of the town to resist sorties. This fort was subsequently\r\n  raised to a height of six storeys, under shelter of a roof which\r\n  projected beyond the walls, and from the eaves of which hung heavy\r\n  mats made of ships' cables. The mats protected the men working at the\r\n  walls, and as these were built up the roof was gradually raised by the\r\n  use of endless screws. The roof was made of heavy beams and planks,\r\n  over which were laid bricks and clay, and the whole was covered with\r\n  mats and hides to prevent the bricks from being dislodged. This\r\n  structure was completed without the loss of a man, and could only have\r\n  been built by the Romans, whose soldiers were all skilled workmen.\r\n\r\n  Although these towers were provided with bridges by which storming\r\n  parties could reach the top of the wall, their main object was usually\r\n  to dominate the defence and keep down the fire from the walls and\r\n  towers. Under this protection breaching operations could be carried\r\n  on. The approaches to the wall were usually made under shelter of\r\n  galleries of timber or hurdle-work, which were placed on wheels and\r\n  moved into position as required. When the wall was reached, a shelter\r\n  of stronger construction, known as a \"rat,\" was placed in position\r\n  against it. Under this a ram was swung or worked on rollers; or the\r\n  rat might be used as a shelter for miners or for workmen cutting away\r\n  the face of the wall. The great rat at Marseilles, which extended from\r\n  the tower already described to the base of the tower of the city, was\r\n  60 ft. long, and built largely of great beams 2 ft. square, connected\r\n  by iron pins and bands. It was unusually narrow, the ground sills of\r\n  the side walls being only 4 ft. apart. This was no doubt in order to\r\n  keep down the weight of the structure, which, massive as it was, had\r\n  to be movable. The sloping roof and sides of timber were protected,\r\n  like those of the tower, with bricks and moist clay, hides and wool\r\n  mattresses. Huge stones and barrels of blazing pitch were thrown from\r\n  the wall upon this rat without effect, and under its cover the\r\n  soldiers loosened and removed the foundations of the tower until it\r\n  fell down.\r\n\r\n  In order that it might be possible to move these heavy structures, it\r\n  was usually necessary to fill up the ditch or to level the surface of\r\n  the ground. For this purpose an \"approach tortoise\" was often used.\r\n  This was a shelter, something between the ordinary gallery and the\r\n  rat, which was moved end on towards the wall, and had an open front\r\n  with a hood, under cover of which the earth brought up for filling the\r\n  ditch was distributed.\r\n\r\n  The missile engines threw stones up to 600 lb. weight, heavy darts\r\n  from 6 to 12 ft. long, and Greek fire. Archimedes at the siege of\r\n  Syracuse even made some throwing 1800 lb. The ranges varied, according\r\n  to the machine and the weight thrown, up to 600 yds. for direct fire\r\n  and 1000 yds. for curved fire. At the siege of Jerusalem Titus\r\n  employed three hundred catapults of different sizes and forty\r\n  balistae, of which the smallest threw missiles of 75 lb. weight. At\r\n  Carthage Scipio found 120 large and 281 medium catapults, 23 large and\r\n  52 small balistae, and a great number of scorpions and other small\r\n  missile engines.\r\n\r\n  Screens and mantlets for the protection of the engine-workers were\r\n  used in great variety.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the above, great mechanical skill was shown in the\r\n  construction of many kinds of machines for occasional purposes. A kind\r\n  of jib crane of great height on a movable platform was used to hoist a\r\n  cage containing fifteen or twenty men on to the wall. A long spar with\r\n  a steel claw at the end, swung in the middle from a lofty frame,\r\n  served to pull down the upper parts of parapets and overhanging\r\n  galleries. The defenders on their side were not slow in replying with\r\n  similar devices. Fenders were let down from the wall to soften the\r\n  blow of the ram, or the ram heads were caught and held by cranes.\r\n  Grapnels were lowered from cranes to seize the rats and overturn them.\r\n  Archimedes used the same idea in the defence of Syracuse for lifting\r\n  and sinking the Roman galleys. Wooden towers were built on the walls\r\n  to overtop the towers of the besiegers. Many devices for throwing fire\r\n  were employed. The tradition that Archimedes burnt the Roman fleet, or\r\n  a portion of it, at Syracuse, by focusing the rays of the sun with\r\n  reflectors, is supported by an experiment made by Buffon in 1747. With\r\n  a reflector having a surface of 50 sq. ft., made up of 168 small\r\n  mirrors each 6 by 8 in., lead was melted at a distance of 140 ft. and\r\n  wood was set on fire at 160 ft.\r\n\r\n  The development of masonry in permanent fortification had long since\r\n  reached its practical limit, and was no longer proof against the\r\n  destructive methods that had been evolved. The extemporized defences\r\n  were, as is always the case, worn down by a resolute besieger, and the\r\n  attack was stronger than the defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Middle ages.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark ages the Eastern Empire kept alive the twin sciences of\r\nfortification and siegecraft long enough for the Crusaders to learn from\r\nthem what had been lost in the West. Byzantium, however, always a\r\nstorehouse of military science, while conserving a knowledge of the\r\nancient methods and the great missile engines, contributed no new ideas\r\nto fortification, so far as we know. In practice the Byzantines favoured\r\nmultiplied enceintes or several concentric lines of defence. This of\r\ncourse is always a tendency of decadent nations.\r\n\r\nIn the West the Roman fortifications remained standing, and the\r\nVisigoths, allies of Rome, utilized their principles in the defences of\r\nCarcassonne, Toulouse, &c. in the 5th century. Viollet-le-Duc's\r\ndescription and illustrations of the defences of Carcassonne will give a\r\nvery good idea of the methods then in use:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Visigoth fortification of the city of Carcassonne, which is still\r\n  preserved, offers an analogous arrangement recalling those described\r\n  by Vegetius. The level of the town is much more elevated than the\r\n  ground outside, and almost as high as the parapet walks. The curtain\r\n  walls, of great thickness, are composed of two faces of small cubical\r\n  masonry alternating with courses of brick; the middle portion being\r\n  filled, not with earth but with rubble run with lime. The towers were\r\n  raised above these curtains, and their communication with the latter\r\n  might be cut off, so as to make of each tower a small independent\r\n  fort; externally these towers are cylindrical, and on the side of the\r\n  town square; they rest, also towards the country, upon a cubical base\r\n  or foundation. We subjoin (fig. 1) the plan of one of these towers\r\n  with the curtains adjoining. A is the plan of the ground-level; B the\r\n  plan of the first storey at the level of the parapet. We see, at C and\r\n  D, the two excavations formed in front of the gates of the tower to\r\n  intercept, when the drawbridges were raised, all communication between\r\n  the town or the parapet walk and the several storeys of the tower.\r\n  From the first storey access was had to the upper crenellated or\r\n  battlemented portion of the tower by a ladder of wood placed\r\n  interiorly against the side of the flat wall. The external\r\n  ground-level was much lower than that of the tower, and also beneath\r\n  the ground-level of the town, from which it was reached by a\r\n  descending flight of from ten to fifteen steps. Fig. 2 shows the tower\r\n  and its two curtains on the side of the town; the bridges of\r\n  communication are supposed to have been removed. The battlemented\r\n  portion at the top is covered with a roof, and open on the side of the\r\n  town in order to permit the defenders of the tower to see what was\r\n  going on therein, and also to allow of their hoisting up stones and\r\n  other projectiles by means of a rope and pulley. Fig. 3 shows the same\r\n  tower on the side towards the country; we have added a postern, the\r\n  sill of which is sufficiently raised above the ground to necessitate\r\n  the use of a scaling or step ladder, to obtain ingress. The postern is\r\n  defended, as was customary, by a palisade or barrier, each gate or\r\n  postern being provided with a work of this kind.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Plan of one of the Towers at Carcassonne.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--One of the Towers at Carcassonne, inside view.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in western Europe, siegecraft had almost disappeared. Its\r\nperfect development was only possible for an army like that of the\r\nRomans. The Huns and Goths knew nothing of it, and the efforts of\r\nCharlemagne and others of the Frankish kings to restore the art were\r\nhampered by the fact that their warriors despised handicrafts and\r\nunderstood nothing but the use of their weapons. During the dark ages\r\nthe towns of the Gauls retained their old Roman and Visigoth defences,\r\nwhich no one knew properly how to attack, and accordingly the sieges of\r\nthat period dragged themselves out through long years, and if ultimately\r\nsuccessful were so as a rule only through blockade and famine. It was\r\nnot until the 11th century that siegecraft was revived in the West on\r\nthe ancient lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--One of the Towers at Carcassonne, outside view.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Castles.\r\n\r\nBy this time a new departure of great importance had been made in the\r\nseigneurial castle (q.v.), which restored for some centuries a definite\r\nsuperiority to the defence. Built primarily as strongholds for local\r\nmagnates or for small bodies of warriors dominating a conquered country,\r\nthe conditions which called them into existence offered several marked\r\nadvantages. The defences of a town had to follow the growth of the town,\r\nand would naturally have weak points. It was not to be expected that a\r\ntown would develop itself in the manner most suitable for defence; nor\r\nindeed that any position large enough for a town could be found that\r\nwould be naturally strong all round. But the site of a castle could be\r\nchosen purely for its natural strength, without regard, except as a\r\nsecondary consideration, to the protection of anything outside it; and\r\nas its area was small it was often easy to find a natural position\r\nentirely suited for the purpose. In fact it frequently happened that the\r\nexistence of such a position was the _raison d'etre_ of the castle. A\r\nsmall hill with steep sides might well be unapproachable in every\r\ndirection by such cumbrous structures as towers and rats, while the\r\nheight of the hill, added to the height of the walls, would be too much\r\nfor the besiegers' missiles. If the sides of the hill were precipitous\r\nand rocky, mining became impossible, and the site was perfect for\r\ndefence. A castle built under such conditions was practically\r\nimpregnable; and this was the cause of the independence of the barons in\r\nthe 11th and 12th centuries. They could only be reduced by blockade, and\r\na blockade of long duration was very difficult in the feudal age.\r\n\r\nA very instructive example of 12th-century work is the Chateau Gaillard,\r\nbuilt by Richard Coeur-de-Lion in 1196. This great castle, with ditches\r\nand escarpments cut out of the solid rock, and extensive outworks, was\r\ncompleted in one year. In the article CASTLE will be found the plan of\r\nthe main work, which is here supplemented by an elevation of the donjon\r\n(or keep). The waved face of the inner or main wall of the castle,\r\ngiving a divergent fire over the front, is an interesting feature in\r\nadvance of the time. So also is the masonry protection of the\r\nmachicolation at the top of the donjon, a protection which at that time\r\nwas usually given by wooden hoardings. After the death of Richard,\r\nPhilip Augustus besieged the chateau, and carried it after a blockade of\r\nseven months and a regular attack of one month. In this attack the tower\r\nat A was first mined, after which the whole of that outwork was\r\nabandoned by the defenders. The outer enceinte was next captured by\r\nsurprise; and finally the gate of the main wall was breached by the\r\npioneers. When this happened a sudden rush of the besiegers prevented\r\nthe remains of the garrison from gaining the shelter of the donjon, and\r\nthey had to lay down their arms.\r\n\r\nChateau Gaillard, designed by perhaps the greatest general of his time,\r\nexemplifies in its brief resistance the weak points of the designs of\r\nthe 12th century. It is easy to understand how at each step gained by\r\nthe besiegers the very difficulties which had been placed in the way of\r\ntheir further advance prevented the garrison from reinforcing strongly\r\nthe points attacked.\r\n\r\nIn the 13th century many influences were at work in the development of\r\ncastellar fortification. The experience of such sieges as that of\r\nChateau Gaillard, and still more that gained in the Crusades, the larger\r\ngarrisons at the disposal of the great feudal lords, and the importance\r\nof the interests which they had to protect in their towns, led to a\r\nfreer style of design. We must also take note of an essential difference\r\nbetween the forms of attack preferred by the Roman soldiery and by the\r\nmedieval chivalry. The former, who were artisans as well as soldiers,\r\npreferred in siege works the certain if laborious methods of breaching\r\nand mining. The latter, who considered all manual labour beneath them\r\nand whose only ideal of warfare was personal combat, affected the tower\r\nand its bridge, giving access to the top of the wall rather than the rat\r\nand battering-ram. They were also fond of surprises, which the bad\r\ndiscipline of the time favoured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Donjon, Chateau Gaillard.]\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, important progress in enlarging the area of defence\r\nand in improving arrangements for flanking. The size and height of all\r\nworks were increased. The keep of Coucy Castle, built in 1220, was 200\r\nft. high. Montargis Castle, also built about this time, had a central\r\ndonjon and a large open enclosure, within which the whole garrison could\r\nmove freely, to reinforce quickly any threatened point. The effect of\r\nflanking fire was increased by giving more projection to the towers,\r\nwhose sides were in some cases made at right angles to the curtain\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nWe find also a tendency, the influence of which lasted long after\r\nmedieval times, towards complexity and multiplication of defences, to\r\nguard against surprise and localize successful assaults. Great attention\r\nwas paid to the \"step by step\" defence. Flanking towers were cut off\r\nfrom their walls and arranged for separate resistance. Complicated\r\nentrances with traps and many doors were arranged. Almost all defence\r\nwas from the tops of the walls and towers, the loopholes on the lower\r\nstoreys being mainly for light and air and reconnoitring. Machicouli\r\ngalleries (for vertical defence) were protected either by stone walls\r\nbuilt out on corbels, or by strong timber hoardings built in war time,\r\nfor which the walls were prepared beforehand by recesses left in the\r\nmasonry. Loopholes and crenelles were protected by shutters. Great care\r\nand much ingenuity were expended on details of all kinds.\r\n\r\nAlready in the 12th century the engineers of the defence had made\r\nprovision for countermining, by building chambers and galleries at the\r\nbase of the towers and walls. Further protection for the towers against\r\nthe pioneer attack was given by carrying out the masonry in front of the\r\ntower in a kind of projecting horn. This was found later to have the\r\nfurther advantages of doing away with the dead ground in front of the\r\ntower unseen from the curtain, and of increasing the projection and\r\ntherefore the flanking power of the tower itself. The arrangement is\r\nseen in several of the towers at Carcassonne, and has in it the germ of\r\nthe idea of the bastion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Plan of Carcassonne, 13th century.]\r\n\r\n  The defences of Carcassonne, remodelled in the latter half of the 13th\r\n  century on the old Visigoth foundations, exemplify some of the best\r\n  work of the period. Figs. 5 and 6 (reproduced from Viollet-le-Duc)\r\n  show the plan of the defences of the town and castle, and a bird's-eye\r\n  view of the castle with its two barbicans. The thick black line shows\r\n  the main wall; beyond this are the lists and then the moat. It will be\r\n  noted that the wall of the lists as well as the main wall is defended\r\n  by towers. There are only two gates. That on the east is defended by\r\n  two great towers and a semicircular barbican. The gate of the castle,\r\n  on the west, has a most complicated approach defended by a labyrinth\r\n  of gates and flanking walls, which cannot be shown on this small\r\n  scale, and beyond these is a huge circular barbican in several\r\n  storeys, capable of holding 1500 men. On the side of the town the\r\n  castle is protected by a wide moat, and the entrance is masked by\r\n  another large semicircular barbican. An interesting feature of the\r\n  general arrangement is the importance which the lists have assumed.\r\n  The slight wooden barricade of older times has developed into a wall\r\n  with towers; and the effect is that the besieger, if he gains a\r\n  footing in the lists, has a very narrow space in which to work the\r\n  engines of attack. The castle, after the Roman fashion, adjoins the\r\n  outer wall of the town, so that there may be a possibility of\r\n  communicating with a relieving force from outside after the town has\r\n  fallen. There were also several posterns, small openings made in the\r\n  wall at some height above the ground, for use with rope ladders.\r\n\r\nThe siegecraft of the period was still that of the ancients. Mining was\r\nthe most effective form of attack, and the approach to the walls was\r\ncovered by engines throwing great stones against the hoardings of the\r\nparapets, and by cross-bowmen who were sheltered behind light mantlets\r\nmoved on wheels. Barrels of burning pitch and other incendiary\r\nprojectiles were thrown as before; and at one siege we read of the\r\ncarcasses of dead horses and barrels of sewage being thrown into the\r\ntown to breed pestilence, which had the effect of forcing a\r\ncapitulation.\r\n\r\nWith all this the attack was inferior to the defence. As Professor\r\nC.W.C. Oman has pointed out, the mechanical application of the three\r\npowers of tension, torsion and counterpoise (in the missile engines) had\r\nits limits. If these engines were enlarged they grew too costly and\r\nunwieldy. If they were multiplied it was impossible on account of their\r\nshort range and great bulk to concentrate the fire of enough of them on\r\na single portion of the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Introduction of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give anything like an accurate account, in a small\r\nspace, of the changes in fortification which took place in the first two\r\ncenturies after the introduction of gunpowder. The number of existing\r\nfortifications that had to be modified was infinite, so also was the\r\nnumber of attempted solutions of the new problems. Engineers had not yet\r\nbegun to publish descriptions of their \"systems\"; also the new names and\r\nterms which came into use with the new works were spread over Europe by\r\nengineers of different countries, and adopted into new languages without\r\nmuch accuracy.\r\n\r\nArtillery was in use for some time before it began to have any effect on\r\nthe design of fortification. The earliest cannon threw so very light a\r\nprojectile that they had no effect on masonry and were more useful for\r\nthe defence than the attack. Later, larger pieces were made, which acted\r\npractically as mortars, throwing stone balls with high elevation, and\r\nbarrels of burning composition. In the middle of the 15th century the\r\nart of cannon-founding was much developed by the brothers Bureau in\r\nFrance. They introduced iron cannon balls and greatly strengthened the\r\nguns. In 1428 the English besieging Orleans were entirely defeated by\r\nthe superior artillery of the besieged. By 1450 Charles VII. was\r\nfurnished with so powerful a siege train that he captured the whole of\r\nthe castles in Normandy from the English in one year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Carcassonne Castle and Barbican.]\r\n\r\nBut the great change came after the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII.\r\nwith a greatly improved siege train in 1494. The astonishing rapidity\r\nwith which castles and fortified towns fell before him proved the\r\nuselessness of the old defences. It became necessary to create a new\r\nsystem of defences, and, says Cosseron de Villenoisy, \"thanks to the\r\nmental activity of the Renaissance and the warlike conditions prevailing\r\neverywhere, the time could not have been more favourable.\" There is no\r\ndoubt that the engineers of Italy as a body were responsible for the\r\nfirst advance in fortification. There, where vital and mental energy\r\nwere at boiling-point, and where the first striking demonstration of the\r\nnew force had been given, the greatest intellects, men such as Leonardo\r\nda Vinci, Michelangelo and Machiavelli, busied themselves over the\r\nproblem of defence.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that Albert Durer was the first writer on modern\r\nfortification. This was not so; Durer's work was published in 1527, and\r\nmore than one Italian engineer, certainly Martini of Siena and San\r\nGallo, had preceded him. Also Machiavelli, writing between 1512 and\r\n1527, had offered some most valuable criticisms and general principles.\r\nDurer, moreover, had little influence on the progress of fortification;\r\nthough we may see in his ideas, if we choose, the germ of the\r\n\"polygonal\" system, developed long afterwards by Montalembert. Durer's\r\nwork was to some extent a connecting link between the old fortification\r\nand the new. He proposed greatly to enlarge the old towers; and he\r\nprovided both them and the curtains with vaulted chambers for guns\r\n(casemates) in several tiers, so as to command both the ditch and the\r\nground beyond it. His projects were too massive and costly for\r\nexecution, but his name is associated with the first practical gun\r\ncasemates.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning to trace the effect of gunpowder on the design of\r\nfortification, it may be noted that two causes weakened the influence of\r\nthe castles. First, their owners were slow to adopt the new ideas and\r\nabandon their high strong walls for low extended parapets, and,\r\nsecondly, they had not the men necessary for long lines of defence. At\r\nthe same time the corporations of the towns had learnt to take an active\r\npart in warfare, and provided trained and disciplined soldiers in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nWhen artillery became strong enough to destroy masonry from a distance\r\ntwo results followed: it was necessary to modify the masonry defences so\r\nas to make them less vulnerable, and to improve the means of employing\r\nthe guns of the defence. For both these purposes the older castles with\r\ntheir restricted area were little suited, and we must now trace the\r\ndevelopment of the fortified towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The bulwark.\r\n\r\n  Probably the first form of construction directly due to the appearance\r\n  of the new weapons was the bulwark (_boulevard, baluardo_ or\r\n  _bollwerk_). This was an outwork usually semicircular in plan, built\r\n  of earth consolidated with timber and revetted with hurdles. Such\r\n  works were placed as a shield in front of the gates, which could be\r\n  destroyed even by the early light cannon-balls; and they offered at\r\n  the same time advanced positions for the guns of the defence. They\r\n  were found so useful for gun positions for flanking fire that later\r\n  they were placed in front of towers or at intervals along the walls\r\n  for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  This, however, was only a temporary expedient, and we have now to\r\n  consider the radical modifications in designs. These affected both the\r\n  construction and trace of the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The wall.\r\n\r\n  The first lesson taught by improved artillery was that the walls\r\n  should not be set up on high as targets, but in some manner screened.\r\n  One method of doing this in the case of old works was by placing\r\n  bulwarks in front of them. In other cases the lists or outer walls,\r\n  being surrounded by moats, were already partially screened and\r\n  suitable for conversion into the main defence; and as with improved\r\n  flanking defence great height was no longer essential, the tops of the\r\n  walls were in some cases cut down. In new works it was natural to sink\r\n  the wall in a ditch, the earth from which was useful for making\r\n  ramparts.\r\n\r\n  As regards resistance to the effect of shot, it was found that thin\r\n  masonry walls with rubble filling behind them were very easily\r\n  destroyed. A bank of earth behind the wall lessened the vibration of\r\n  the shot, but once a breach was made the earth came down, making a\r\n  slope easy of ascent. To obviate this, horizontal layers of brushwood,\r\n  timber and sometimes masonry were built into the earth bank, and\r\n  answered very well (fig. 7).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n  Another expedient of still greater value was the use of counterforts.\r\n  The earliest counterforts were simply buttresses built _inward_ from\r\n  the wall into the rampart instead of _outward_ (fig. 8). Their effect\r\n  was to strengthen the wall and make the breaches more difficult of\r\n  ascent. An alternative arrangement for strengthening the wall was an\r\n  arched gallery built behind it under the rampart (fig. 9). This\r\n  construction was in harmony with the idea, already familiar, of a\r\n  passage in the wall from which countermines could be started; but it\r\n  has the obvious weakness that the destruction of the face wall takes\r\n  away one of the supports of the arch. The best arrangement, which is\r\n  ascribed to Albert Durer, was the \"counter-arched revetment.\" This\r\n  consisted of a series of arches built between the counterforts, with\r\n  their axes at right angles to the face of the wall. Their advantage\r\n  was that, while supporting the wall and taking all the weight of the\r\n  rampart, they formed an obstacle after the destruction of the wall\r\n  more difficult to surmount than the wall itself and very hard to\r\n  destroy. The counter-arches might be in one, two or three tiers,\r\n  according to the height of the wall (figs. 10 and 11, the latter\r\n  without the earth of the rampart and showing also a countermine\r\n  gallery).\r\n\r\n\r\n    The rampart.\r\n\r\n  A more important question, however, than the improvement of the\r\n  passive defence or obstacle was the development of the active defence\r\n  by artillery. For this purpose it was necessary to find room for the\r\n  working of the guns. At the outset it was of course a question of\r\n  modifying the existing defences at as little cost as possible. With\r\n  this object the roofs of towers were removed and platforms for guns\r\n  substituted, but this only gave room for one or two guns. Also the\r\n  loopholes in the lower storeys of towers were converted into\r\n  embrasures to give a grazing fire over the ditch; this became the\r\n  commonest method of strengthening old works for cannon, but was of\r\n  little use as the resulting field of fire was so small. In some cases\r\n  the towers were made larger, with a semicircular front and side walls\r\n  at right angles to the curtain. Such towers built at Langres early in\r\n  the 16th century had walls 20 ft. thick to resist battering.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n  Even in new works some attempts were made to combine artillery defence\r\n  with pure masonry protection. The works of Albert Durer in theory, and\r\n  the bridge-head of Schaffhausen in practice, are the best examples of\r\n  this. The Italian engineers also showed much ingenuity in arranging\r\n  for the defence of ditches with masonry caponiers. These were\r\n  developed from external buttresses, and equally with the casemated\r\n  flanking towers of Durer contained the germs of the idea of\r\n  \"polygonal\" defence.\r\n\r\n  The natural solution, however, which was soon generally adopted, was\r\n  the rampart; that is, a bank of earth thrown up behind the wall,\r\n  which, while strengthening the wall as already indicated, offered\r\n  plenty of space for the disposal of the guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ditch.\r\n\r\n  The _ditch_, which had only been occasionally used in ancient and\r\n  medieval fortification, now became essential and characteristic.\r\n  Serving as it did for the double purpose of supplying earth for a\r\n  rampart and allowing the wall to be sunk for concealment, it was found\r\n  also to have a definite use as an obstacle. Hitherto the wall had\r\n  sufficed for this purpose, the ditch being useful mainly to prevent\r\n  the besieger from bringing up his engines of attack.\r\n\r\n  When the wall (or escarp) was lowered, the obstacle offered by the\r\n  ditch was increased by revetting the far side of it with a\r\n  _counterscarp_. Beyond the counterscarp wall some of the earth\r\n  excavated from the ditch was piled up to increase the protection given\r\n  to the escarp wall. This earth was sloped down gently on the outer\r\n  side to meet the natural surface of the ground in such a manner as to\r\n  be swept by the fire from the ramparts and was called the _glacis_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n  Now, however, a new difficulty arose. In all times a chief element in\r\n  a successful defence has consisted in action by the besieged outside\r\n  the walls. The old ditches, when they existed, had merely a slope on\r\n  the far side leading up to the ground-level; and the ditch was a\r\n  convenient place in which troops preparing for a sortie could assemble\r\n  without being seen by the enemy, and ascend the slope to make their\r\n  attack. The introduction of the counterscarp wall prevented sorties\r\n  from the ditch. At first it was customary, after the introduction of\r\n  the counterscarp, to leave a narrow space on the top of it, behind the\r\n  glacis, for a patrol path. Eventually the difficulty was met by\r\n  widening this patrol path into a space of about 30 ft., in which there\r\n  was room for troops to assemble. This was known as the _covered way_.\r\n\r\n  With this last addition the ordinary elements of a profile of modern\r\n  fortification were complete and are exemplified in fig. 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The trace.\r\n\r\nUp to the gunpowder period the _trace_ of fortifications, that is, the\r\nplan on which they were arranged on the ground, was very simple. It was\r\nmerely a question of an enclosure wall adapted to the site and provided\r\nwith towers at suitable intervals. The foot of the wall could be seen\r\nand defended everywhere, from the tops of the towers and the machicoulis\r\ngalleries. The introduction of ramparts and artillery made this more\r\ndifficult in two ways. The rampart, interposed between the defenders and\r\nthe face of the wall, put a stop to vertical defence. Also with the\r\ninferior gun-carriages of the time very little depression could be given\r\nto the guns, and thus the top of the enceinte wall, with or without a\r\nrampart, was not a suitable position for guns intended to flank the\r\nditch in their immediate neighbourhood. The problem of the \"trace\"\r\ntherefore at the beginning of the 16th century was to rearrange the line\r\nof defence so as to give due opportunity to the artillery of the\r\nbesieged, both to oppose the besiegers' breaching batteries and later to\r\ndefend the breaches. At the outset the latter role was the more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIn considering the early efforts of engineers to solve this problem we\r\nmust remember that for economical reasons they had to make the best use\r\nthey could of the existing walls. At first for flanking purposes\r\ncasemates on the ditch level were used, the old flanking towers being\r\nenlarged for the purpose. Masonry galleries were constructed across the\r\nditch, containing casemates which could fire to either side, and after\r\nthis casemates were used in the counterscarps. Some use was also made of\r\nthe fire from detached bulwarks. It was soon realized, however, that the\r\nflanking defence of the body of the place ought not to be dependent on\r\noutworks, and that greater freedom was required for guns than was\r\nconsistent with casemate defence. The _bulwark_ (which in its earliest\r\nshape suggests that it was in some sort the offspring of the barbican,\r\nplaced to protect an entrance) gave plenty of space for guns, but was\r\ntoo detached for security. The enlarged tower, as an integral part of\r\nthe lines, gave security, and its walls at right angles to the curtain\r\ngave direct flanking fire, but the guns in it were too cramped. The\r\nblending of the two ideas produced the _bastion_, an element of\r\nfortification which dominated the science for three hundred years, and\r\nso impressed itself on the imagination that to this day any strong\r\nadvanced position in a defensive line is called by that name by\r\nunscientific writers. The word had been in use for a long time in\r\nconnexion with extemporized towers or platforms for flanking purposes,\r\nthe earliest forms being _bastille_, _bastide_, _bastillon_, and in its\r\norigin it apparently refers rather to the quality of work in the\r\nconstruction than to its defensive intention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Bastion at Troyes.]\r\n\r\n  The earliest bastions were modified bulwarks with straight faces and\r\n  flanks, attached to the main wall, for which the old towers often\r\n  acted as keeps; and at first the terms bulwark and bastion were more\r\n  or less interchangeable. Fig. 13, taken from a contemporary MS. by\r\n  Viollet-le-Duc, shows a bastion added to the old wall of Troyes about\r\n  1528. On the other hand, in fig. 14 (taken from an English MS. of\r\n  1559, which again is based on the Italian work of Zanchi published in\r\n  1554), we find _a a_ spoken of as \"bulwarks\" and _b b_ as\r\n  \"bastilions.\" The triangular works between the bastilions are\r\n  described as \"ramparts,\" intended to protect the curtains from\r\n  breaching fire. (We may also notice in this design the broad ditch,\r\n  the counterscarp with narrow covered way, and loopholes indicating\r\n  counterscarp galleries.)\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 16th century the term \"bulwark\" began to be\r\nreserved for banks of earth thrown up a little distance in front of the\r\nmain wall to protect it from breaching fire, and it thus reverted to its\r\noriginal defensive intention. The term \"bastion\" henceforth denoted an\r\nartillery position connected by flanks to the main wall; and the\r\nquestion of the arrangement of these flanks was one of the main\r\npreoccupations of engineers. Flanks retired, casemated or open, or\r\nsometimes in several tiers were proposed in infinite variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nThus, while in the early part of the 16th century the actual\r\nmodification of existing defences was proceeding very slowly on account\r\nof the expense involved, the era of theoretical \"systems\" had begun,\r\nbased on the mutual relations of flank and face. These can be grouped\r\nunder three heads as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. The _cremaillere_ or indented trace: Faces and flanks succeeding\r\n  each other in regular order (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n  2. The _tenaille_ trace: Flanks back to back between the faces (fig.\r\n  16). The development of the flanks in this case gives us the _star_\r\n  trace (fig. 17).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n  3. The _bastioned_ trace: Flanks facing each other and connected by\r\n  curtains (fig. 18).\r\n\r\nIn comparing these three traces it will be observed that unless\r\ncasemates are used the flanking in the first two is incomplete. Guns on\r\nthe ramparts of the faces cannot defend the flanks, and therefore there\r\nare \"dead\" angles in the ditch. In the bastioned trace there is no\r\n\"dead\" ground, provided the flanks are so far apart that a shot from the\r\nrampart of a flank can reach the ditch at the centre of the curtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The bastioned trace.\r\n\r\nHere was therefore the parting of the ways. For those who objected to\r\ncasemate fire, the bastioned trace was the way of salvation. They were\r\nsoon in the majority; perhaps because the symmetry and completeness of\r\nthe idea captivated the imagination. At all events the bastioned trace,\r\nonce fairly developed, held the field in one form or another practically\r\nwithout a rival until near the end of the 18th century. The Italian\r\nengineers, who were supreme throughout most of the 16th century, started\r\nit; the French, who took the lead in the following century, developed\r\nit, and officially never deserted it until late in the 19th century,\r\nwhen the increasing power of artillery made enceintes of secondary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n  It will be useful at this point to go forward a little, with a couple\r\n  of explanatory figures, in order to get a grasp of the component parts\r\n  of the bastioned trace as ultimately developed, and of its outworks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n  In fig. 19 ABCD represents part of an imaginary line drawn round the\r\n  place to be fortified, forming a polygon, regular or irregular.\r\n\r\n  ABC is an _exterior angle_ or angle of the polygon.\r\n\r\n  BC is an _exterior side_.\r\n\r\n  _zz_ is an _interior side_.\r\n\r\n  _abcdefghijk_ is the trace of the _enceinte_.\r\n\r\n  _bcdef_ is a _bastion_.\r\n\r\n  _zdef_ is a _demi-bastion_.\r\n\r\n  _de_ is a _face_ of the bastion.\r\n\r\n  _ef_ is a _flank_ of the bastion.\r\n\r\n  _fg_ is the _curtain_.\r\n\r\n  _bf_ is the _gorge_.\r\n\r\n  (Two demi-bastions with the connecting curtain make the bastioned\r\n  front, _defghi_.)\r\n\r\n  _zd_ bisecting the _exterior angle_ ABC is the _capital_ of the\r\n  bastion.\r\n\r\n  _xy_ is the _perpendicular_, the proportionate length of which to the\r\n  exterior side BC (usually about one-sixth) is an important element of\r\n  the trace.\r\n\r\n  _ef_C is the angle of _defence_.\r\n\r\n  BC_f_ is the _diminished angle_.\r\n\r\n  _cde_ is the _flanked angle_ or _salient angle_ of the bastion.\r\n\r\n  _e_ is the _shoulder_ of the bastion.\r\n\r\n  _def_ is the _angle of the shoulder_.\r\n\r\n  _efg_ is the _angle of the flank_.\r\n\r\n  The line of the escarp is called the _magistral line_ since it\r\n  regulates the trace. When plans of fortifications are given without\r\n  much detail, this line, with that of the counterscarp and the crest of\r\n  the parapet, are often the only ones shown,--the crest of the parapet,\r\n  as being the most important line, whence the fire proceeds, being\r\n  usually emphasized by a thick black line.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 20, reproduced from a French engraving of 1705, shows an\r\n  imaginary place fortified as a hexagon with bastions and all the\r\n  different kinds of outworks then in use. The following is the\r\n  explanation of its figuring and lettering.\r\n\r\n  1. _Flat bastion:_ Placed in the middle of a curtain when the lines of\r\n  defence were too long for musketry range.\r\n\r\n  2. _Demi-bastion:_ Used generally on the bank of a river.\r\n\r\n  3. _Tenaille bastion:_ Used when the flanked angle is too acute; that\r\n  is, less than 70 deg.\r\n\r\n  4. _Redans:_ Used along the bank of a river, or when the parapet of\r\n  the covered way can be taken in reverse from the front.\r\n\r\n  A, B. _Ravelins._\r\n\r\n  C. _Demi-lunes:_ So called from the shape of the gorge. They differ\r\n  from the ravelins in being placed in front of the bastions instead of\r\n  the curtains.\r\n\r\n  D. _Counter-guards:_ Used instead of demi-lunes, which were then going\r\n  out of fashion.\r\n\r\n  E. _Simple tenaille._\r\n\r\n  F. _Double tenaille_ (see L and M).\r\n\r\n  (If the tenaille E is reduced in width towards the gorge, as shown\r\n  alternatively, it is called a _swallow-tail_. If the double tenaille\r\n  is reduced as at G, it is called a _bonnet de pretre_. Such works\r\n  were rarely used.)\r\n\r\n  H. _Hornwork:_ Much used for gates, &c.\r\n\r\n  I. _Crown-work._\r\n\r\n  K. _Crowned hornwork._\r\n\r\n  L. M. New forms of _tenaille_: (N.B.--These are the forms which\r\n  ultimately retained the name.)\r\n\r\n  N. New form of work called a _demi-lune lunettee_, the ravelin N being\r\n  protected by two counterguards, O.\r\n\r\n  P. _Re-entering places of arms._\r\n\r\n  Q. _Traverses._\r\n\r\n  R. _Salient places of arms._\r\n\r\n  S. _Places of arms_ without _traverses_.\r\n\r\n  T. Orillon, to protect the flank V.\r\n\r\n  X. A _double bastion_ or _cavalier_.\r\n\r\n  Y. A _retrenchment_ with a ditch, of the breach Z.\r\n\r\n  &. _Traverses_ to protect the terreplein of the ramparts from\r\n  enfilade.\r\n\r\nTurning back now to the middle of the 16th century we find in the early\r\nexamples of the use of the bastion that there is no attempt made to\r\ndefend its faces by flanking fire, the curtains being considered the\r\nonly weak points of the enceinte. Accordingly, the flanks are arranged\r\nat right angles to the curtain, and the prolongation of the faces\r\nsometimes falls near the middle of it. When it was found that the faces\r\nneeded protection, the first attempts to give it were made by erecting\r\n_cavaliers_, or raised parapets, behind the parapet of the curtain or in\r\nthe bastions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nThe first example of the complete bastioned system is found in\r\nPaciotto's citadel of Antwerp, built in 1568 (fig. 21). Here we have\r\nfaces, flanks and curtain in due proportion; the faces long enough to\r\ncontain a powerful battery, and the flanks able to defend both curtain\r\nand faces. The weak points of this trace, due to its being arranged on a\r\nsmall pentagon, are that the terreplein or interior space of the\r\nbastions is rather cramped, and the salient angles too acute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The 16th century.\r\n\r\nIn the systems published by Speckle of Strassburg in 1589 we find a\r\ndistinct advance. Speckle's actual constructions in fortification are of\r\nno great importance; but he was a great traveller and observer, and in\r\nhis work, published just before his death, he has evidently assimilated,\r\nand to some extent improved, the best ideas that had been put forward up\r\nto that time.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens from Speckle's work are well worth studying as connecting\r\nlinks between the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 22 is early 16th-century work much improved. There are no\r\n  outworks, except the covered way, now fully developed, with a battery\r\n  in the re-entering place of arms. The bastions are large, but the\r\n  faces directed on the curtain get little protection from the flanks.\r\n  To make up for this they are flanked by the large cavaliers in the\r\n  middle of the curtain. The careful arrangement of the flank should be\r\n  noted; part of it is retired, with two tiers of fire, some of which is\r\n  arranged to bear on the face of the bastion. The great saliency of the\r\n  bastion is a weak point, but the whole arrangement is simple and\r\n  strong.\r\n\r\n  In the second example, known as Speckle's \"reinforced trace\" (fig.\r\n  23), we find him anticipating the work of the next century. The\r\n  ravelin is here introduced, and made so large that its faces are in\r\n  prolongation of those of the bastions. Speckle's other favourite\r\n  ideas are here: the cavaliers and double parapets and his own\r\n  particular invention of the low batteries behind the re-entering place\r\n  of arms and the gorge of the ravelin. These low batteries did not find\r\n  favour with other writers, being liable to be too easily destroyed by\r\n  the besiegers' batteries crowning the salients of the covered way.\r\n\r\n  Speckle's book is of great importance as embodying the best work of\r\n  the period. His own ideas are large and simple, but rather in advance\r\n  of the powers of the artillery of his day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The 17th century.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 17th century we find the Italian engineers\r\nfollowing Paciotto in developing the complete bastioned trace; but they\r\ngot on to a bad line of thought in trying to reduce everything to\r\nsymmetry and system. The era of geometrical fortification (or, as Sir\r\nGeorge Clarke has called it, \"drawing-board\" fortification) had already\r\nbegun with Marchi, and his followers busied themselves entirely in\r\nfinding geometrical solutions for the application of symmetrical\r\nbastioned fronts to such imaginary forms of perimeter as the oval, club,\r\nheart, figure of eight, &c. Marchi, however, was one of the first to\r\nthink of prolonging the resistance of a place by means of outworks such\r\nas the ravelin. De Villenoisy says that Busca was the first to discuss\r\nthe proportions and functions of all the component parts of a front; and\r\nFloriani, about 1630, was the last of the important Italians. The\r\ncharacteristics of a good deal of Spanish fortification carried out at\r\nthis time were, according to the same authority, that the works were\r\nwell adapted to sites, and the masonry excellent but too much exposed,\r\nwhile the bastions were too small. The Dutch and German schools will be\r\nreferred to later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Speckle's Reinforced Trace.]\r\n\r\nThe French engineers now began to take the lead in adapting the\r\nprinciples already established to actual sites. In the first half of the\r\ncentury the names of de Ville and Pagan stand out as having contributed\r\nvaluable studies to the advancement of the science. In putting forward\r\ntheir designs they discussed very fully such practical questions as the\r\nlength of the line of defence, whether this should be governed by the\r\nrange of artillery or musketry fire, the length of flanks, the use in\r\nthem of orillons, casemates and retired flanks, the size of bastions,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nIt is the latter half of the 17th century, however, which is one of the\r\nmost important periods in the history of fortification, chiefly because\r\nit was illuminated by the work of Vauban. It was at this time also that\r\na prodigious output of purely theoretical fortification began, which\r\nwent on till the French Revolution. Many of the \"systems\" published at\r\nthis time were elaborated by men who had no practical knowledge of the\r\nsubject, some of them priests who were engaged in educating the sons of\r\nthe upper classes, and who had to teach the elements of fortification\r\namong other things. They naturally wrote treatises, which were valuable\r\nfor their clearness of style; and with their industry and ingenuity the\r\nelaboration of existing methods was a very congenial task. Most of these\r\nessays took the form of multiplication and elaboration of outworks on an\r\nimpossible scale, and they culminated in such fantastic extravagances as\r\nthe system of Rhana, published in 1769 (fig. 24). These proposals,\r\nhowever, were of no practical importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vauban.\r\n\r\nThe work of the real masters who knew more than they published can\r\nalways be recognized by its comparative simplicity. The greatest of\r\nthese was Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban (q.v.). Born in 1633, and\r\nbusied from his eighteenth year till his death in 1707 in war or\r\npreparations for war, he earned alike by his genius, his experience, his\r\nindustry and his personal character the chief place among modern\r\nmilitary engineers. His experience alone puts him in a category apart\r\nfrom others. Of this it is enough to say that he took part in\r\nforty-eight sieges, forty of which he directed as chief engineer without\r\na single failure, and repaired or constructed more than 160 places.\r\nVauban's genius was essentially practical, and he was no believer in\r\nsystems. He would say, \"One does not fortify by systems but by common\r\nsense.\" Of new ideas in fortification he introduced practically none,\r\nbut he improved and modified existing ideas with consummate skill in\r\nactual construction. His most original work was in the attack (see\r\nbelow), which he reduced to a scientific method most certain in its\r\nresults. It is therefore one of the ironies of fate that Vauban should\r\nbe chiefly known to us by three so-called \"systems,\" known as his\r\n\"first,\" \"second\" and \"third.\" How far he was from following a system is\r\nshown by de Villenoisy, who reproduces twenty-eight fronts constructed\r\nby him between 1667 and 1698, no two of which are quite alike and most\r\nof which vary very considerably to suit local conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nVauban's \"first system,\" as variously described by other writers even in\r\nhis own time, is pieced together from some of the early examples of his\r\nwork. The \"second system\" is the \"tower bastion\" defence of Belfort and\r\nLandau (1684-1688), obviously suggested by a design of Castriotto's one\r\nhundred years earlier; and the \"third system\" is the front of\r\nNeu-Breisach (1698), which is merely Landau slightly improved. In other\r\nworks, between 1688 and 1698, he did not keep to the tower bastion idea.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to take the \"first system,\" as reproduced in the\r\nRoyal Military Academy text book of fortification (fig. 25) as typical\r\nof much of Vauban's work. It may be observed that he sometimes uses the\r\nstraight flank, and sometimes the curved flank with orillon. Parapets in\r\nseveral tiers are never used, nor cavaliers. The ravelin is almost\r\nalways used. It is small, having little artillery power and giving no\r\nprotection to the shoulders of the bastions. Sometimes it has flanks and\r\noccasionally a keep.\r\n\r\nThe tenaille is very generally found. In this form, viz. as a shield to\r\nthe escarp of the curtain, it was probably invented by him. Fig. 25\r\nshows two forms. In both the parapet of the tenaille had to be kept low,\r\nso that the flanks might defend a breach at the shoulder of the opposite\r\nbastion, with artillery fire striking within 12 ft. of the base of the\r\nescarp. Traverses are used for the first time on the covered way to\r\nguard against enfilade fire; and the re-entering place of arms, to which\r\nVauban attached considerable importance, is large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Vauban's First System.]\r\n\r\n  For the construction of the trace an average length of about 400 yds.\r\n  (which, however, is a matter entirely dependent on the site) may be\r\n  taken for the exterior side. The perpendicular, except for polygons of\r\n  less than six sides, is one-sixth, and the faces of the bastions\r\n  two-sevenths of the exterior side. The flanks are chords of arcs\r\n  struck from the opposite shoulder as centres. An arc described with\r\n  the same radius, but with the angle of the flank as a centre, and\r\n  cutting the perpendicular produced outwardly, gives the salient of the\r\n  ravelin; the prolongations of the faces of the ravelin fall upon the\r\n  faces of the bastions at 11 yds. from the shoulders. The main ditch\r\n  has a width of 38 yds. at the salient of the bastions, and the\r\n  counterscarp is directed upon the shoulders of the adjoining bastions.\r\n  The ditch of the ravelin is 24 yds. wide throughout.\r\n\r\n  As regards the profile the bastions and curtain have a command of 25\r\n  ft. over the country, 17 ft. over the crest of the glacis and 8 ft.\r\n  over the ravelin. The ditches are 18 ft. deep throughout. The parapets\r\n  are 18 ft. thick with full revetments. In his later works he used\r\n  demi-revetments.\r\n\r\nFig. 26 shows the tower bastions of Neu-Breisach, or the so-called\r\n\"third system.\" It is worth introducing, simply as showing that even a\r\nmind like Vauban's could not resist in old age the tendency to duplicate\r\ndefences. Here the main bastions and tenaille are detached from the\r\nenceinte. The line of the enceinte is broken with flanks and further\r\nflanked by the towers. The ravelin is large and has a keep. The section\r\nthrough the face of the bastion shows a demi-revetment with wide berm,\r\nand a hedge as an additional obstacle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  18th and 19th centuries.\r\n\r\nAfter Vauban died, though the theories continued, the valuable additions\r\nto the system were few. Among his successors in the early part of the\r\n18th century Cormontaingne (q.v.) has the greatest reputation, though\r\nhis experience and authority fell far short of Vauban's. He was a clear\r\nthinker and writer, and the elements of the system were distinctly\r\nadvanced by him. His trace includes an enlarged ravelin with flanks, the\r\nends of which were intended to close the gaps at the end of the\r\ntenaille, and a keep to the ravelin with flanks. He provides a very\r\nlarge re-entering place of arms, also with a keep, the ditches of which\r\nare carefully traced so as to be protected from enfilade by the salients\r\nof the ravelin and bastion. He was also in favour of a permanent\r\nretrenchment of the gorge of the bastion. His works were printed, with\r\nmany alterations, more than twenty years after his death, to serve as a\r\ntext-book for the school of Mezieres. This school was established in\r\n1748, and from this time forward there was an official school of\r\nthought, based on Vauban. Cormontaingne's work, therefore, represents\r\nthe modifications of Vauban's ideas accepted by French engineers in the\r\nlatter part of the 18th century. The school of Mezieres was afterwards\r\nreplaced by that of Metz, which carried on its traditions. Such schools\r\nare necessarily conservative, and hence, in spite of the gradual\r\nimprovement in ordnance and firearms, we find the main elements of the\r\nbastioned system remaining unchanged right up to the period of the\r\nFranco-German War in 1870. Chasseloup-Laubat tells us that, before the\r\nRevolution, to attempt novelties in fortification was to write one's\r\nself down ignorant. How far the general form of the bastion with its\r\noutworks had become crystallized is evident from a cursory comparison of\r\nfig. 27 with Vauban's early work. This figure is the front of the Metz\r\nschool in 1822, by General Noizet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Neu-Breisach.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Noizet.]\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, the official view was that the general outlines of the\r\nsystem were sacred, the efforts of orthodox engineers from\r\nCormontaingne's time onwards were given to improvements of detail, and\r\nmainly to retard breaching operations as long as possible. We find\r\nenormous pains being bestowed on the study of the comparative heights of\r\nthe masonry walls and crest levels; with the introduction here and there\r\nof glacis slopes in the ditches, put in both to facilitate their\r\ndefence and to protect portions of the escarps.\r\n\r\nAmong the unorthodox two names deserve mention. The first of these is\r\nChasseloup-Laubat (q.v.), who served throughout the wars of the Republic\r\nand Empire, and constructed the fortress of Alessandria in Piedmont.\r\n\r\n  Chasseloup's main proposals to improve the bastioned system were two:\r\n\r\n  First, in order to prevent the bastions from being breached through\r\n  the gaps made by the ditch of the ravelin, he threw forward the\r\n  ravelin and its keep outside the main glacis. This had the further\r\n  advantage of giving great saliency to the ravelin for cross-fire over\r\n  the terrain of the attack. On the other hand, it made the ravelin\r\n  liable to capture by the gorge. It is probable that this system would\r\n  have lent itself to a splendid defence by an able commander with a\r\n  strong force; but under the opposite conditions it has a dangerous\r\n  element of weakness.\r\n\r\n  Secondly, in order to get freedom to use longer fronts than those\r\n  admissible for the ordinary bastioned trace, he proposed to extend his\r\n  exterior side up to about 650 yds. and to break the faces of his\r\n  bastions; the portion next the shoulder being defended from the flank\r\n  of the collateral bastion and coinciding with the line of defence, and\r\n  the portion next the salient, up to about 80 yds. in length, being\r\n  defended from a central keep or caponier placed in front of the\r\n  tenaille. The natural criticism of this arrangement is that it\r\n  combines some of the defects of both the bastioned and polygonal\r\n  systems without getting the full advantages of either.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Chasseloup-Laubat.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 28 shows a half front of Chasseloup's system, of ordinary length,\r\n  as actually constructed. The section shows an interesting detail, viz.\r\n  the Chasseloup mask--a detached mask with tunnels for the casemate\r\n  guns to fire through, the intention of which is to save them from\r\n  being destroyed from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe second name is that of Captain Choumara of the French Engineers,\r\nborn in 1787, whose work was published in 1827. Two leading ideas are\r\ndue to him. The first is that of the \"independence of parapets.\" A\r\nglance at any of the plans that have already been shown will show that\r\nhitherto the crests of parapets had always been traced parallel to the\r\nescarp or magistral line. Choumara pointed out that, while it was\r\nnecessary for the escarp to be traced in straight lines with reference\r\nto the flanking arrangements, there was no such necessity as regards the\r\nparapets. By making the crest of the parapet quite independent of the\r\nescarp line he obtained great freedom of direction for his fire. The\r\nsecond idea is that of the \"inner glacis.\" This was a glacis parapet\r\nplaced in the main ditch to shield the escarp; its effect being to\r\nprevent the escarp of the body of the place from being breached in the\r\nusual way by batteries crowning the crest of the covered way.\r\n\r\nThe need for Choumara's improvements has passed by, but he was in his\r\ntime a real teacher. One sentence of his strikes a resounding note:\r\n\"What is chiefly required in fortification is simplicity and strength.\r\nIt is not on a few little contrivances carefully hidden that one can\r\nrely for a good defence. _The fate of a place should not depend on the\r\nintelligence of a corporal shut up in a small post prepared for his\r\ndetachment._\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Sedan in 1705.]\r\n\r\n  Before leaving the bastioned system it will be of interest to study a\r\n  couple of actual and complete examples, one irregular and one regular.\r\n  Fig. 29 shows the defences of Sedan as they were at the end of the\r\n  17th century. One sees the touch of Vauban here and there, but the\r\n  work is for the most part apparently early 17th century. It will be\r\n  observed that on the river side of the town the defence consists of\r\n  very irregular bastions with duplicated wet ditches (see the Dutch\r\n  style, below); and on the other side, where water is not available,\r\n  strength is sought for by pushing a succession of hornworks far out.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 30 is Saarlouis, constructed by Vauban in 1680 in his early\r\n  manner, a remarkable example of symmetry. Vauban of course never\r\n  thought of aiming at symmetry, which is of itself neither good nor\r\n  bad, but it is interesting to note such a perfect example of the\r\n  system.\r\n\r\n  It must here be remarked that the reproach of \"geometrical\"\r\n  fortification is in no way applicable to the works of Vauban and his\r\n  immediate successors. The true geometric fortification, which\r\n  worshipped symmetry as a fetish, marked, as has been already pointed\r\n  out, the decadence of the Italian school. Vauban and his fellows\r\n  excelled in adapting works to sites, the real test of the engineer.\r\n\r\n  The bastioned system was the 17th-century solution of the\r\n  fortification problem. Given an artillery and musketry of short range\r\n  and too slow for effective frontal defence, a ditch is necessary as an\r\n  obstacle. What is the best means of flanking the ditch and of\r\n  protecting the flanking arrangements? If Vauban elected for the\r\n  bastion, we must before criticizing his choice remember that he was\r\n  the most experienced engineer of his day, a man of the first ability\r\n  and quite without prejudice. What is matter for regret is that the\r\n  authority of Vauban should have practically paralysed the French\r\n  school during the 18th and most of the 19th century, so that while the\r\n  conditions of attack and defence were gradually altering they could\r\n  admit no change of idea, and their best men, who could not help being\r\n  original, were struggling against the whole weight of official\r\n  opposition.\r\n\r\n  Again, such duplication of outworks as we see at Sedan is not\r\n  geometric fortification. It is a definite attempt to retard the\r\n  attack, on ground favourable to it, by successive lines of defence. As\r\n  to the policy of this, no axiom can be laid down. Nowadays most of us\r\n  think, as Machiavelli did, that a single line of defence is best and\r\n  that a second line only serves to suggest the advisability of\r\n  retreat. There are also, of course, the recognized drawbacks of\r\n  outworks, difficulty of retreat, of relief and so forth, and the moral\r\n  effect of their loss. But the engineers of such defences as Ostend and\r\n  Candia might well say, \"Oh, if only when we had held on to that\r\n  bastion for so many months we had had a second and a third line of\r\n  permanent retrenchment to fall back upon, we could have held the place\r\n  for ever.\" And who shall say that they were wrong? Let us at all\r\n  events remember that the leading engineers of that time were men who\r\n  had passed their lives in a state of war, and that we ourselves in\r\n  comparison with them are the theorists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Dutch school.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the 16th century the Dutch methods of fortification\r\nacquired a great reputation, thanks to the stout resistance offered to\r\nthe Spaniards by some of their fortresses, the three years' defence of\r\nOstend being perhaps the most striking example. Prolonged defences,\r\nwhich were mainly due to the desperate energy of the besieged, were\r\ncredited to the quality of their defences. In point of fact the Dutch\r\nowed more to nature, and more still to their own spirit, than to art;\r\nbut they showed a good deal of skill in adapting recent ideas to their\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThree conditions governed the development of the Dutch works at this\r\ntime, viz. want of time, want of money and abundance of water. When the\r\nNetherlands began their revolt against Spain, they would no doubt have\r\nbeen glad enough of expensive masonry fortresses on such models as\r\nPaciotto's citadel of Antwerp. But there was neither time nor money for\r\nsuch works. Something had to be extemporized, and fortunately for them\r\nthey had wet ditches to take the place of high revetted walls.\r\nEverywhere water was near the surface, and rivers or canals were\r\navailable for inundations. A wide and shallow ditch, while making a good\r\nobstacle, was also the readiest means of obtaining earth for the\r\nramparts. High command was, owing to the flatness of the country,\r\nunnecessary and even undesirable, as it did not allow of grazing fire.\r\n\r\nWhat the Dutch actually did in strengthening their towns gives little\r\nevidence of system. Starting as a rule from an existing enceinte,\r\nsometimes a medieval wall, they would provide a broad wet ditch. No\r\nfurther provision was usually made on the sides of the town which were\r\nadditionally protected by a river or inundation. On the other sides the\r\nwet ditch was made still broader, and sometimes contained a\r\ncounterguard, sometimes ravelins and lunettes. These were quite\r\nirregular in their design and relation to each other. At the foot of the\r\nglacis would be found another but narrower wet ditch, which was a\r\npeculiarly Dutch feature; and sometimes if the town was in a bend of a\r\nriver there would be a canal cut across the bend in a straight line,\r\nstrengthened by several redans.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, they endeavoured to provide for the want of a\r\nfirst-class masonry obstacle by multiplication of wet ditches, and\r\nfurther to strengthen these obstacles by great quantities of palisading,\r\nfor which purpose the timber of old ships was used. They also recognized\r\nthe inherent weaknesses of wet ditches, as, for instance, that when\r\nfrozen they no longer provide an obstacle; and they studied the means,\r\nnot only of causing inundations, but also of arranging to empty as well\r\nas to fill the ditches at will. Simon Stevin was the leader in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a Dutch school of design did come into existence at this\r\ntime. The leaders, early in the 17th century, were Simon Stevin, Maurice\r\nand Henry of Nassau, Marollois and Freitag. The fortress of Coevorden,\r\nconstructed by Prince Maurice, of which fig. 31 shows a front, is a\r\nwell-known example of this, and the section shows clearly some typical\r\nfeatures of the school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Coevorden.]\r\n\r\n  The elements of the plan are those of the early bastioned trace, but\r\n  we find added both ravelins and lunettes, very regular in design.\r\n  There is also the ditch at the foot of the glacis, and surrounding the\r\n  rampart of the enceinte a continuous fausse-braie. This work, which\r\n  partook of the nature of both boulevard and counterguard, served\r\n  several purposes. It was desirable that the weight of the rampart\r\n  should be drawn back a little from the edge of the ditch, and the\r\n  fausse-braie filled what would otherwise have been dead ground at the\r\n  foot of the rampart. It also afforded a grazing fire over the ditch,\r\n  which was very important, and which the rampart supported by a\r\n  plunging fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Coehoorn.\r\n\r\nCoehoorn (q.v.), the contemporary and nearest rival to Vauban, was the\r\ngreatest light of the Dutch school. Like Vauban he was distinguished as\r\na fighting engineer, both in attack and defence; but in the attack he\r\ndiffered from him in relying more on powerful artillery fire than\r\nsystematic earthworks. He introduced the Coehoorn mortar. His \"first\r\nsystem,\" which was employed at Mannheim (fig. 32), is reproduced for the\r\nsake of comparison with the Coevorden front designed a hundred years\r\nearlier. Among other points will be noticed the combination of wet and\r\ndry ditches; the very broad main ditch with counterguard; the roomy keep\r\nof the ravelin; the expansion of the fausse-brais into an independent\r\nlow parapet; and the powerful flanking fire in three tiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Coehoorn's First System.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  German school.\r\n\r\nThe \"tenaille\" system and the \"polygonal\" system which grew out of it\r\nare mainly identified with the _German school_. That school, says von\r\nZastrow, does not, like that of France, represent the authoritative\r\nteaching of an official establishment, but rather the general practice\r\nof the German engineers. It was founded on the principles of Durer,\r\nSpeckle and especially Rimpler, and much influenced in execution by\r\nMontalembert. \"The German engineers desired a simple trace, a strong\r\nfortification with retrenchments and keeps, bomb-proof accommodation and\r\nan organization suitable for an offensive defence.\"\r\n\r\nThese had always been the German principles. Already in the 16th century\r\nthe Prussian defences of Kustrin, Spandau and Peitz had large bomb-proof\r\ncasemates sufficient for a great part of the garrison. The same thing is\r\nseen in the defences of Giogau, Schweidnitz, &c., built by Frederick the\r\nGreat. These works show various applications of the tenaille system. In\r\n1776 Frederick became acquainted with the work of Montalembert, and his\r\ninfluence is seen in the casemates of Kosel.\r\n\r\nWhether through the influence of Albert Durer or not cannot be said, but\r\nwhile the bastion was being developed in France the tenaille and the\r\naccompanying casemates from the first found acceptance in Germany, and\r\nthence in eastern and northern Europe. De Groote, who wrote in 1618,\r\nproduced a sort of tenaille system, and may have been the inspiration of\r\nRimpler. Dillich (1640), Landsberg the elder (1648), Griendel d'Aach\r\n(1677), Werthmuller (1685) and others advocated both bastion and\r\ntenaille, sometimes in combination; the German bastion being usually\r\ndistinguished by short faces and long flanks.\r\n\r\nRimpler, who was present at the siege of Candia (taken by the Turks in\r\n1669) and died at that of Vienna in 1683, exercised a great influence.\r\nHe had been struck by the weakness of the early Italian bastions at\r\nCandia, and published a book in 1673 called _Fortification with Central\r\nBastions_, which was practically the polygonal trace. Zastrow thinks\r\nthat Rimpler inspired Montalembert. He left unfortunately no designs to\r\nillustrate his ideas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\nLandsberg the younger (1670-1746), a major-general in the Prussian\r\nservice, who saw many sieges, also had a great influence. He appears to\r\nhave been the first who frankly advocated the tenaille alone, chiefly on\r\nthe ground that the flank, which was the most important part of the\r\nbastioned system, was also the weakest. Fig. 33 shows his system,\r\npublished in 1712.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Montalembert and Carnot.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, ultimately a Frenchman, Marc Rene Montalembert (q.v.),\r\nwho was the great apostle of the tenaille, though in his later years he\r\nleaned more to the polygonal trace. He objected to the bastioned trace\r\non many grounds; principally that the bastion was a shell trap, that the\r\nflanks by crossing their fire lost the advantage of the full range of\r\ntheir weapons, and that the curtain was useless for defence. He took the\r\nview that the bastions with their ravelins constituted practically a\r\ntenaille trace, spoilt by the detachment of the ravelins and cramped by\r\nthe presence of the curtains and flanks. His tenaille system consisted\r\nof redans, with salient angles of 60 deg. or more, flanking each other at\r\nright angles; from which he gave to his system the name of\r\n\"perpendicular fortification.\"\r\n\r\nLazare Carnot (q.v.), the \"Organizer of Victory,\" was, in\r\nfortification, a follower of Montalembert, and produced in 1797 a\r\ntenaille system (fig. 34) on strong and simple lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\n  In 1812 Carnot offered three systems. For a dry and level site he\r\n  recommended a bastioned trace; but for wet ditches and for irregular\r\n  ground, tenaille traces. Both of these latter differ from his 1797\r\n  trace in that the re-entering angle is reinforced by a tenaille whose\r\n  faces are parallel to the main faces and reach almost to the salients.\r\n  There are also counterguards in front of the salients, whose ends\r\n  overlap the ends of the tenaille. (N.B. To avoid confusion between the\r\n  _tenaille trace_ and the _tenaille_, it should be noted that the\r\n  latter is a low detached parapet placed in front of the escarp of the\r\n  body of the place, partly as a shield, and partly as an additional\r\n  line of defence. It is used in front of the curtain in the bastioned\r\n  trace, and in the re-entering angle in the tenaille trace.)\r\n\r\n  Other important features of Carnot's work were: a continuous general\r\n  retrenchment, or interior parapet, following more or less the lines of\r\n  the main parapet; the use of the detached wall in place of the escarp\r\n  revetment; and the countersloping glacis. This last (of which Carnot\r\n  was not the inventor), instead of sloping gently outwards from a crest\r\n  raised about 8 ft. down to the natural level of the ground, sloped\r\n  inwards from the ground-level to the bottom of the ditch. The\r\n  advantage of the additional obstacle of the counterscarp was thus lost\r\n  to the defence. On the other hand, the besiegers' saps, as they\r\n  progressed down the glacis, were exposed to a plunging fire from the\r\n  parapet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Mortar-casemate and Detached Wall.]\r\n\r\nCarnot was also, like Coehoorn, a great believer in the mortar; but\r\nwhile Coehoorn introduced the small portable mortar that bears his name,\r\nCarnot expected great results from a 13 in. mortar throwing 600 iron\r\nballs at each discharge. He endeavoured to prove mathematically that the\r\ndischarge of these mortars would in due course kill off the whole of the\r\nbesieging force. These mortars he emplaced in open fronted\r\nmortar-casemates, in concealed positions. Fig. 35 shows in section one\r\nof these mortar-casemates, placed between the parapet of the\r\nretrenchment and a detached wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Montalembert, 1786.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The polygonal trace.\r\n\r\nThe leading idea of Montalembert was that for a successful defence it\r\nwas necessary for the artillery to be superior to that of the enemy.\r\nThis idea led him to the adoption of casemates in several tiers; in\r\npreference to open parapets, exposed to artillery fire of all kinds,\r\nhigh angle, ricochet and reverse. In considering the defects of bastions\r\nhe had arrived at the conclusion that for flanking purposes two forms of\r\ntrace were preferable; either the tenaille form, connecting the ravelins\r\nwith the body of the place, or the form in which the primary flanking\r\nelements, instead of facing each other with overlapping fire, as with\r\nthe bastions, should be placed back to back in the middle of the\r\nexterior side. Fig. 36 is an example of this. The central flanking work\r\nresulting from this arrangement is the caponier of the early Italians,\r\nreintroduced and developed; and with it Montalembert laid the foundation\r\nof the polygonal system of our own time.\r\n\r\nMontalembert was one of the first to foresee the coming necessity for\r\ndetached forts, and it was for these that he chiefly proposed to use\r\nhis caponier flanking, preferring the tenaille system for large places.\r\nIn abandoning the bastioned trace he was already committed to the\r\nprinciple of casemate defence for ditches; and the combination of this\r\nprinciple with his desire for an overwhelming artillery defence led him\r\nin the course of years of controversial writing into somewhat\r\nextravagant proposals. For instance, for a square fort of about 400 yds.\r\nside, he proposed over 1000 casemate guns; and one of his caponier\r\nsections shows 10 tiers of masonry gun-casemates one above the other.\r\nConfiding in the power of such an artillery, he freely exposed the upper\r\nparts of his casemates to direct fire.\r\n\r\nMontalembert is said to have contributed more new ideas to fortification\r\nthan any other man. His designs must be considered in some ways\r\nunworkable and unsound, but all the best work of the 19th century rests\r\non his teaching. The Germans, who already used the tenaille system and\r\nmade free provision of bomb-proof casemates, took from him the polygonal\r\ntrace and the idea of the entrenched camp.\r\n\r\nThe polygonal system in fortification implies straight or slightly\r\nbroken exterior sides, flanked by casemated caponiers. The caponier is\r\nthe vital point of the front, and is protected in important works by a\r\nravelin and keep. The essence of the system is its simplicity, which\r\nallows of its being applied to any sort of ground, level or broken, and\r\nto long or short fronts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Front at Posen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  1815-1855, entrenched camps.\r\n\r\nThe final period of smooth bore artillery is an important one in the\r\nhistory of fortification. It is true that the many expensive works that\r\nwere constructed at this time were obsolete almost as soon as they were\r\nfinished; but this was inevitable, thanks to the pace at which the world\r\nwas travelling. After the Napoleonic wars the Germanic Confederation\r\nbegan to strengthen its frontiers; and considering that they had not\r\nderived much strategic advantage from their existing fortresses, the\r\nGermans took up Montalembert's idea of entrenched camps, utilizing at\r\nthe same time his polygonal system with modifications for the main\r\nenceintes. The Prussians began with the fortresses of Coblenz and\r\nCologne; later Posen, Konigsberg and other places were treated on the\r\nsame lines. The Austrians constructed, among other places, Linz and\r\nVerona. The Germanic Confederation reinforced Mainz with improved works,\r\nand reorganized entirely Rastatt and Ulm. The Bavarians built\r\nGermersheim and Ingolstadt. While all these works were conceived in the\r\nspirit of Rimpler and Montalembert, they showed the differences of\r\nnational temperament. The Prussian works, simple in design, relied upon\r\npowerful artillery fire, and exposed a good deal of masonry to the\r\nenemy's view. The Austrians covered part of their masonry with earth and\r\ngave more attention to detail.\r\n\r\nThe German development of the polygonal system at this time is not of\r\ngreat importance, since the great masonry caponiers were designed\r\nwithout sufficient consideration for the increasing powers of artillery.\r\nOne example (fig. 37) is given for the sake of historical comparison. It\r\nis a front of Posen.\r\n\r\n  \"The exterior side of the front is about 650 yds. (600 metres) long.\r\n  It is flanked by a central caponier, which is protected by a _detached\r\n  bastion_.... The main front is broken back to flank the faces of the\r\n  bastion from casemates behind the escarp, as well as from the parapet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Posen.\r\n\r\n  \"The central caponier forms the keep of the whole front and sweeps\r\n  both the interior and the ditch by its flanking fire. It has two\r\n  floors of gun-casemates and one for musketry, and on the top is a\r\n  parapet completely commanding alike the outworks and the body of the\r\n  place. It contains barrack accommodation for a battalion of 1000 men,\r\n  and has a large inner courtyard closed at the gorge by a detached\r\n  wall. The caponier is itself flanked by three small caponiers at the\r\n  head, and one at the inner end of each flank.\r\n\r\n  \"The escarp of the body of the place is a simple detached wall; that\r\n  of the detached bastion is either a detached wall with piers and\r\n  arches, or a counter-arched revetment. At the salient of the bastion\r\n  there is a mortar battery under the rampart, and a casemated traverse\r\n  for howitzers upon the terreplein. The flanks of the bastion are\r\n  parallel to those of the caponier, and at the same distance from it as\r\n  the faces.\r\n\r\n  \"Masonry blockhouses, loopholed for musketry, are provided as keeps of\r\n  the re-entering and salient places of arms. In the latter case they\r\n  have stairs leading down into a counterscarp gallery, which serves as\r\n  a base for countermine galleries, and is connected with the detached\r\n  bastion by a gallery under the ditch. The counterscarp is not revetted\r\n  if the ditch is wet.\r\n\r\n  \"The angle of the polygon should not be less than 160 deg., in order\r\n  that the prolongation of the main ditch may fall within the salients\r\n  of the detached bastions of the neighbouring fronts, and the masonry\r\n  of the caponiers may thus be hidden from outside view.\" (R.M.A.\r\n  _Text-book of F. & M.E._, 1886.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  The detached fort.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a period when the \"detached fort\" becomes of more\r\nimportance than the organization of the enceinte. The early conception\r\nof the role of detached forts in connexion with the fortress was to form\r\nan entrenched camp within which an army corps could seek safety if\r\nnecessary. The idea had occurred to Vauban, who added to the permanent\r\ndefences of Toulon a large camp defended by field parapets attached to\r\none side of the fortress. The substitution of a ring of detached forts,\r\nwhile giving it the greater safety of permanent instead of field\r\ndefences, gave also a wider area and freer scope for the operations of\r\nan army seeking shelter under the guns of a fortress, and at the same\r\ntime made siege more difficult by increasing the line of investment. The\r\nuse of the detached fort as a means of protecting the body of the place\r\nfrom bombardment had not yet been made necessary by increased range of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nWhen these detached forts were first used by Germany the scope of the\r\nidea had evidently not been realised, as they were placed much too close\r\nto the fortress. Those at Cologne, for instance, were only some 400 or\r\n500 yds. in advance of the ramparts. The same leading idea is seen in\r\nmost of these forts as in the new enceintes; i.e. a lunette, with a\r\ncasemated keep at the gorge. The keep is the essential part of the work,\r\nthe rampart of the lunette serving to protect it from frontal artillery\r\nfire. The keep projects to the rear, so as not only to be able to flank\r\nits own gorge, but to give some support to the neighbouring works with\r\nguns protected from frontal fire. This is a valuable arrangement, which\r\nis still sometimes used. The front ditches of the lunettes were flanked\r\nby caponiers. Some of the larger forts were simple quadrangular works\r\nwith casemate barracks and caponier ditch defence.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, in Austria, the archduke Maximilian made an entirely fresh\r\ndeparture with the defences of Linz. The idea was to provide an\r\nentrenched camp at the least possible cost, whose works should require\r\nthe smallest possible garrison. With this object Linz was surrounded\r\nwith a belt of circular towers spaced about 600 yds. apart. The towers,\r\n25 metres in diameter, were enclosed by a ditch and glacis, and\r\ncontained 3 tiers of casemates. The masonry was concealed from view by\r\nthe ditch and glacis. On the top of the tower was an earth parapet, over\r\nwhich a battery of 13 guns fired _en barbette_. In order to find room\r\nfor so many guns in the restricted space, the whole 13 were placed\r\nparallel and close together on a single specially designed mounting.\r\n\r\nThis new departure was received with a certain amount of approval at the\r\ntime, which is somewhat difficult to account for, as a more faulty\r\nsystem could hardly be devised; but the experiment was never repeated.\r\n\r\nThe credit for much of the clear views and real progress made in Germany\r\nduring this period is due to General von Brese-Winiari,\r\ninspector-general of the Prussian engineers.\r\n\r\nFrance, for a few years after 1815, could spare little money for\r\nfortifications, and nothing was done but repairs and minor improvements\r\non the old lines. Belgium, having some money in hand, rebuilt and\r\nimproved in detail a number of bastioned fortresses which had fallen\r\ninto disrepair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. The Fortress of Antwerp.]\r\n\r\nIn 1830 France began to follow the lead of Germany with entrenched\r\ncamps. The enceinte of Paris was reconstructed, and detached forts were\r\nadded at a cost, according to von Zastrow, of L8,000,000. The Belgian\r\nand German frontiers of France being considered fairly protected by the\r\nexisting fortresses, they turned their attention to the Swiss and\r\nItalian frontiers, and constructed three fortresses with detached forts\r\nat Belfort, Besancon and Grenoble. The cost of the new works at Lyons\r\nwas, according to the same writer, L1,000,000 without the armament. Here\r\nand elsewhere the enceinte was simplified on account of the advanced\r\ndefences. That of Paris, which was influenced by political\r\nconsiderations, was a simple bastioned trace with rather long fronts and\r\nwithout ravelins or other outworks; the escarp was high and therefore\r\nexposed, and the counterscarp was not revetted.\r\n\r\nAs regards the detached forts there was certainly a want of clearness of\r\nconception. Those of Paris were simply fortresses in miniature, square\r\nor pentagonal figures with bastioned fronts and containing defensible\r\nbarracks. Those of Lyons were much more carefully designed, but the\r\nauthors wavered between two ideas. Unwilling to give up the bastion, but\r\nevidently hankering after the new caponiers, they produced a type which\r\nit is difficult to praise. The larger works were irregular four- or\r\nfive-sided figures with bastioned fronts; and practically the whole\r\ninterior space was taken up by a large keep, with its ditch, on the\r\npolygonal system. The smaller works, instead of a keep, had defensible\r\nbarracks in the gorge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Period from 1855 to 1870.\r\n\r\nDuring the period 1855-1870 a considerable impulse was given to the\r\nscience of fortification, both by the Crimean War and the arrival of the\r\nrifled gun. One immediate result of these was the condemnation of\r\nmasonry exposed to artillery fire. The most important work of the period\r\nwas the new scheme of defence of Antwerp, initiated in 1859. This is\r\nchiefly interesting as giving us the last and finest expression of the\r\nmedieval enceinte, at a time when the war between the polygonal and\r\nbastioned traces was still raging, though the boom of the long-range\r\nguns had already given warning that a new era had begun. Antwerp is also\r\nassociated with the name of General Brialmont (q.v.), of the Belgian\r\nengineers, whom posterity will no doubt regard as the greatest writer on\r\nfortification of the latter half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Antwerp.\r\n\r\nWe give in figs. 38, 39 and 40 the general plan of the 1859 defences of\r\nAntwerp, the plan of a front of the enceinte, and its sections, as\r\nshowing almost the last word of fortification before the arrival of high\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\nThe defences of Antwerp were designed, as the strategic centre of the\r\nnational defence of Belgium, for an entrenched camp for 100,000 men. The\r\nlength of the enceinte is about 9 m. The detached forts, which on the\r\nsides not defended by inundation are about 1-1/4 m. apart and from 2 to\r\n3 m. in front of the enceinte, are powerful works, arranged for a\r\ngarrison of 1000 men. They have each a frontal crest-line of over 700\r\nyds. and are intended for an armament of 120 guns and 15 mortars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Sections of fig. 39.]\r\n\r\n  The general arrangement of the fronts of the enceinte should be\r\n  compared with the earlier German type of Posen. It will be noticed\r\n  that while the large casemated caponier at Posen breaks the enceinte\r\n  and flanks it both without and within, at Antwerp the caponier is\r\n  detached--a much sounder arrangement--and flanks the front only. The\r\n  defence of the faces rests on the width of the wet ditches and on the\r\n  flanking power of the caponier; there is no attempt to add to it by\r\n  fausse-braie or detached wall. The dimensions are everywhere very\r\n  generous, allowing free movement for the troops of the defence; the\r\n  covered way is 22 yds. wide and there is a double terreplein on the\r\n  face. The parapet of the face is 27 ft. thick. The masonry of the\r\n  casemate guns in the caponier, first flank and low battery, is\r\n  protected by earth, _a la_ Haxo.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Austria acknowledged the influence of the new artillery with\r\nsome new forts at Verona. The detached forts built by Radetzky in 1848\r\nwere only from 1000 to 2000 yds. distant from the ramparts. Those now\r\nadded, of which fig. 41 is an example, were from 3000 to 4000 yds. out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Austrian Fort at Verona.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year the land defences of some of the British dockyards were\r\ntaken in hand. These first serious attempts at permanent fortification\r\nin England were received with approval on the continent, as constituting\r\nan advance on anything that had been done before. The detached forts\r\nintended to keep an enemy outside bombarding distance were roomy works\r\nwith small keeps. The parapets were organized for artillery and the\r\nditches were defended by caponiers or counterscarp galleries. The forts\r\nwere spaced about a mile apart and arranged so as to support each other\r\nby their fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Period from 1870 to 1885.\r\n\r\nThe sieges of the Franco-German War of 1870 are alluded to in the\r\nsection below dealing with the \"Attack of Fortresses.\" As regards their\r\neffect on the designs of fortification the most important thing to note\r\nis the distance to which it was thought necessary to throw out the\r\ndetached forts. These distances were of course influenced by the\r\ncharacter of the ground, but for the most part they were very largely\r\nincreased. Thus at Paris the fort at St Cyr was 18,000 yds. from the\r\nenceinte; at Verdun the distances varied from 2300 to 12,000 yds.; at\r\nBelfort the new forts were from 4500 to 11,500 yds. out; at Metz 2300 to\r\n4500; and at Strassburg 5200 to 10,000. One result of these increased\r\ndistances was of course to increase very largely the length of the zone\r\nof investment, and therefore the strength necessary for the besieging\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAs regards the character of the works, the typical shape adopted both in\r\nFrance and Germany was a very obtuse-angled lunette, shallow from front\r\nto rear. The German type had one parapet only, which was organized for\r\nartillery and heavily traversed, the living casemates being under this\r\nparapet. The ditch defence was provided for by caponiers and a detached\r\nwall (see fig. 42).\r\n\r\nThe French forts had two parapets, that in the rear being placed over\r\nliving casemates (in two tiers, as shown in the section of fig. 43 by a\r\ndotted line), and commanding the front one. There was a long controversy\r\nas to whether the artillery of the fort should be on the upper or the\r\nlower parapet, the advocates of the upper parapet attaching great\r\nimportance to the command that the guns would have over the country in\r\nfront. The other school, objecting to having guns on the skyline,\r\npreferred to sacrifice the command and place them on the lower parapet,\r\nas in fig. 43, the infantry occupying the upper parapet. It will be\r\nobserved that the bastioned trace is abandoned, the ditches, like those\r\nof the German fort, being defended by caponiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--German Fort about 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--French Fort about 1880.]\r\n\r\nWhile a great deal of work was done on these lines, a very active\r\ncontroversy had already begun on the general question as to whether guns\r\nshould be employed in forts at all. Some declared that the accuracy and\r\npower of artillery had already developed so far, that guns in fixed and\r\nvisible positions must needs be put out of action in a very short time.\r\nThe remedy proposed by these was the removal of the guns from the forts\r\ninto \"wing-batteries\" which should be less conspicuous; but soon the\r\nbroader idea was put forward of placing the guns in concealed positions\r\nand moving them from one to another by means of previously prepared\r\nroads or railways. Others declared that there was no safety for the guns\r\noutside the forts, and that the use of steel turrets and disappearing\r\ncupolas was the only solution of the difficulty. General Brialmont, who\r\nhad by this time become the first European authority on fortification\r\nquestions, ranged himself on the side of the turrets. The younger\r\nschool were largely in favour of mobility and expressed themselves\r\neagerly in a shower of pamphlets.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that a new factor was introduced, namely, the\r\nobus-torpille, or long shell with high-explosive bursting charge. With\r\nits appearance we say good-bye to the old school and enter upon the\r\nconsideration of the fortification of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MODERN PERMANENT FORTIFICATION\r\n\r\n  High-angle fire with long shell.\r\n\r\nModern fortification dates by universal consent from 1885. The Germans\r\nhad begun experiments a year or two before this, with long shell\r\ncontaining large charges of gun-cotton. But it was the experiments at\r\nFort Malmaison in France in 1886 that set the military world speculating\r\non the future of fortification. The fort was used as a target for 8-in.\r\nshell of five calibres length containing large charges of melinite. The\r\nreported effects of these made a tremendous sensation, and it was\r\nthought at first that the days of permanent fortification were over.\r\nMagazine casemates were destroyed by a single shell, and revetment walls\r\nwere overturned and practicable breaches made by two or three shells\r\nfalling behind them. It must be remembered, however, that the works were\r\nnot adapted to meet this kind of fire. The casemates had enough earth\r\nover them to tamp the shell thoroughly, but not enough to prevent it\r\nfrom coming into contact with the masonry, and the latter was not thick\r\nenough to resist the explosion of the big charges. Other experiments\r\nwere made in the same direction in Germany, Holland, Belgium and\r\nAustria. The Germans used shell containing from 60 to 130 lb. of high\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\nAfter the first alarm had subsided foreign engineers set about adapting\r\ntheir works to meet the new projectiles. Revetments were enormously\r\nstrengthened, and designed so that their weight resisted overturning.\r\nConcrete roofs were made from 6 to 10 ft. thick, and in many cases the\r\nsurface of the concrete was left bare so as to expose a hard surface to\r\nthe shell without any earth tamping. The idea of cupolas and shielded\r\nguns gained ground, and is now practically accepted all over the\r\ncontinent of Europe. In many cases the main armament, in some only the\r\nsafety armament (see below), is in cupolas in the forts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Plessix and Legrand's _Manuel complet de la\r\nfortification_, by permission.\r\n\r\nFIG. 44.--Metz in 1899.]\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile Europe had been flooded with literature on the subject,\r\nand the whole policy of fortification as well as its minutest details\r\nwere discussed _ab ovo_. The extremists of both sides revelled in their\r\nopportunity. Some declared that, with the use of heavy guns and armour,\r\nfortresses could be made stronger than ever. Others held that modern\r\nfortresses were far too expensive, that their use led to strategic\r\nmistakes, and (arguing from certain well-known examples) that\r\nextemporized field defences could offer as good a resistance as\r\npermanent works.\r\n\r\nEuropean military opinion generally is now more or less agreed on the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\n  1. Important places must be defended by fortresses.\r\n\r\n  2. Their girdle of forts must be far enough out to prevent the\r\n  bombardment of the place.\r\n\r\n  3. An enceinte is desirable, but need not be elaborate.\r\n\r\n  4. A few guns (called \"safety armament\") should be in the forts, and\r\n  these must be protected by armour.\r\n\r\n  5. The bulk of the artillery of the defence should be outside the\r\n  forts; the direct-fire guns preferably in cupolas, the howitzers in\r\n  concealed positions.\r\n\r\n  6. The forts should be connected by lines of entrenched infantry\r\n  positions and obstacles, permanent bomb-proof shelters being provided\r\n  for the infantry.\r\n\r\n  7. There should be ample communications--radial and\r\n  peripheral--between the place and the forts, both by road and rail.\r\n\r\n  8. Special lines of communication--such as mountain passes--should be\r\n  closed by barrier forts.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will now be taken somewhat more in detail, but\r\nfirst it will be useful to deal with the plan of Metz in 1899 (fig. 44).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Metz.\r\n\r\n  Here the fortifications of successive periods can be readily\r\n  recognized. First the old enceinte, unaltered by the Germans and now\r\n  _declassee_. Next the detached forts, begun by the French engineers in\r\n  1868 and still unfinished in 1870, can be readily recognized by their\r\n  bastioned trace. Among them are Fort Manteuffel, formerly St Julien,\r\n  and Fort Goeben (fig. 45), formerly Queuleu. These were not altered in\r\n  their general lines.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Plessix and Legrand's _Manuel complet de la\r\n  fortification_, by permission.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.--Fort Goeben, Metz.]\r\n\r\n  This early line of detached forts, less than 3000 yds. from the\r\n  enceinte, was completed by the Germans with forts of polygonal type\r\n  such as Fort Prinz August. The hill of St Quentin (fig. 46), a very\r\n  important point, was converted into a fortified position, with two\r\n  forts and connecting parapets, and a communication running north to\r\n  Fort Alvensleben.\r\n\r\n  The arrangement of wing batteries in connexion with the forts can be\r\n  clearly noted at Fort Manteuffel. These are reinforced by other\r\n  batteries either for the defence of the intervals or to dominate\r\n  important lines of approach such as the valley of the Moselle (canal\r\n  battery at Montigny). To these were added later armoured batteries.\r\n\r\n  There are also infantry positions, shelters and magazines in connexion\r\n  with this line.\r\n\r\n  Finally some new forts of modern type were commenced in 1899 at about\r\n  9000 yds. from the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fortresses.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of consideration at present the strategic use of groups of\r\nfortresses, the places which, as mentioned above, are intrinsically\r\nworth being defended as fortresses are:--\r\n\r\n  (a) Centres of national, industrial or military resources.\r\n\r\n  (b) Places which may serve as _points d'appui_ for manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n  (c) Points of intersection of important railroads.\r\n\r\n  (d) Bridges over considerable rivers.\r\n\r\n  (e) Certain lines of communication across a frontier.\r\n\r\nExamples of (a) are Paris, Antwerp, Lyons, Verdun. Again for (a) and\r\n(b), as is pointed out by Plessix and Legrand, Metz in the hands of the\r\nGermans may serve both as a base of supplies and a _point d'appui_ for\r\none flank. Strassburg is a bridge-head giving the Germans a secure\r\nretreat across the Rhine if beaten in the plains of Alsace, and an\r\nopportunity of resuming the offensive when they have re-formed behind\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Plessix and Legrand's _Manuel complet de la\r\nfortification_, by permission.\r\n\r\nFIG. 46.--St Quentin position, Metz.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The ring of detached forts.\r\n\r\nThe distance of detached forts from the place depends on the range of\r\nthe siege artillery and the distance at which it can usually be\r\nestablished from the forts, and is variously given by different\r\ncontinental writers at from 4 to 9 km. (4500 to 10,000 yds.). The\r\nbombarding range of siege howitzers with heavy shells is considered to\r\nbe about 8000 yds., and if it is possible for them to be emplaced within\r\nsay 2000 yds. of the forts, this would give a minimum distance of 6000\r\nyds. from the forts to the body of the place. Some writers extend the\r\nminimum distance to 7 km., or nearly 8000 yds. In practice, however, it\r\nmust happen that the position of the forts is determined to a very large\r\nextent by the lie of the ground. Thus some good positions for forts may\r\nbe found within 4000 or 5000 yds. of the place, and no others suitable\r\non the same front within 15,000 yds. In that case the question of\r\nexpense might necessitate choosing the nearer positions. Some examples\r\nof the actual distances of existing forts have already been given.\r\nOthers, more recent, are, at Bucharest 7-10 km., Lyons 8-10(1/2),\r\nCopenhagen 7-8 and Paris 14-17. _Strategic pivots_ are in a different\r\ncategory from other fortresses. While not necessarily protected from\r\nbombardment, they may yet have one or two forts thrown out from 9 to 12\r\nkm., to get advantage of ground. Such are Langres, Epinal and Belfort.\r\n\r\n  _The Enceinte._--The desirability of this is almost universally\r\n  allowed; but often it is more as a concession to tradition than for\r\n  any solid reason. The idea is that behind the line of forts, which is\r\n  the main defensive position, any favourable points that exist should\r\n  be provisionally fortified to assist in a \"step-by-step\" defence: and\r\n  behind these again the body of the place should be surrounded by a\r\n  last line of defence, so that the garrison may resist to the last\r\n  moment. It may be remarked that apart from the additional expense of\r\n  an enceinte, such a position would not, under modern conditions, be\r\n  the most favourable for the last stages of a defence. Again, there is\r\n  the difficulty that it is practically impossible to shut in a large\r\n  modern town by a continuous enceinte. It has been proposed to\r\n  construct the enceinte in sections in front of the salient portions of\r\n  the place. This system of course abandons several of the chief\r\n  advantages claimed for an enceinte.\r\n\r\n  In actual practice enceintes have been constructed since 1870 in\r\n  France and other countries, consisting of a simple wall 10 or 12 ft.\r\n  high with a banquette and loopholes at intervals. This of course can\r\n  only be looked upon as a measure of police. For war purposes, in face\r\n  of modern artillery, it is a _reductio ad absurdum_.\r\n\r\n  _The Safety Armament._--If the bulk of the artillery is to be placed\r\n  in positions prepared on the outbreak of war, it is considered very\r\n  necessary that a few heavy long-range guns should be permanently in\r\n  position ready at any moment to keep an enemy at a distance, forcing\r\n  him to open his first batteries at long range and checking the advance\r\n  of his investment line. Such guns would naturally be in secure\r\n  positions inside the forts, and if they are to be worked from such\r\n  positions they must have armour to shield them from the concentrated\r\n  fire of the numerous field artillery that a besieger could bring to\r\n  bear from the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The question of artillery positions.\r\n\r\nArtillery outside the forts constitutes the most important part of the\r\ndefence, and there is room for much discussion as to whether it should\r\nhave positions prepared for it beforehand or should be placed in\r\npositions selected as the attack develops itself. On the one hand the\r\npreparation of the positions beforehand, which in many cases means the\r\nuse of armour and concrete, increases very largely the initial expense\r\nof the defence, and ties the defender somewhat in the special\r\ndispositions that become desirable once the attack has taken shape.\r\nMoreover, such expenditure must be incurred on all the fronts of the\r\nfortress, whereas the results would only be realized on the front or\r\nfronts actually attacked. On the other hand much time and labour are\r\ninvolved in emplacing heavy and medium artillery with extemporized\r\nprotection, and this becomes a serious consideration when one remembers\r\nhow much work of all kinds is necessary in preparing a fortress against\r\nattack. Again, to avoid the danger of a successful attack on the\r\nintervals between the forts before their defences have been fully\r\ncompleted, the fire of the guns in the intermediate positions might be\r\nurgently required. The solution in any given case would no doubt depend\r\non the importance of the place. In most cases a certain amount of\r\ncompromise will come in, some preparation being made for batteries,\r\nwithout their being completed. Armoured batteries of whatever kind must\r\nin any case be prepared in peace time. It should not be overlooked that\r\nas, whatever theories may exist about successive lines of defence, the\r\nonus of the defence will now lie on the fort line, just as it formerly\r\ndid on the enceintes, so that line should be fully prepared, and should\r\nnot have to commence its fight in a position of inequality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Brialmont's _Progres de la defense des etats et de\r\nla fortification permanente depuis Vauban_, by permission of M. le\r\nCommandant G. Meeus.\r\n\r\nFIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n  _Defence of Intervals of Forts._--The frontal fire of the batteries in\r\n  the intervals and the flanking fire of some of the guns in the forts\r\n  will play an important part, but the main reliance should be on\r\n  infantry defence. A fully prepared fortress would have practically a\r\n  complete chain of infantry fighting positions and obstacles between\r\n  the forts, at all events on the fronts likely to be seriously\r\n  attacked. The positions would consist largely of fire trenches, with\r\n  good communications; but it is pretty generally recognized that there\r\n  must be some _points d'appui_ in the shape of redoubts or infantry\r\n  forts, and also bomb-proof shelter for men, ammunition and stores near\r\n  the fighting line. This is usually included in the redoubts. If they\r\n  are to resist the heaviest shell, such shelters must be built in peace\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  _Communications_ are of the first importance, not merely to facilitate\r\n  the movement of the enormous stores of ammunition and materials\r\n  required in the fighting line, but also that defenders may fully\r\n  utilize the advantage of acting on interior lines. They should include\r\n  both railways and roads running from the centre of the place to the\r\n  different sectors of defence, and all round, in rear of the line of\r\n  forts; also ample covered approaches to the fighting line. Concealment\r\n  is essential, and where the lie of the ground does not help, it must\r\n  be got from earth parapets or plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barrier forts.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of barrier forts is in country where the necessary\r\nline of communication cannot be easily diverted. For instance, in a\r\ncomparatively flat country a barrier fort commanding a road or railway\r\nis of little use because roads may be found passing round it, or a line\r\nof railway may be diverted for some miles to avoid it. But in\r\nmountainous country, where such diversion is impossible, it will be\r\nnecessary for the enemy to capture the fort before he can advance; and\r\nthe impossibility of surrounding it, the few positions from which siege\r\nartillery can be brought into play, and the fact that there is\r\npractically only one road of approach to be denied, make these positions\r\npeculiarly suitable for forts with armoured batteries. Italy makes\r\nconsiderable use of such forts for the defence of frontier passes.\r\n\r\n  _General Brialmont's Theoretical Claim for the Defence of a\r\n  Country._--Before going into details, it is worth while to state the\r\n  full claim of strategic fortification advanced by General Brialmont,\r\n  the most thorough of all its advocates. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A. Fortify the capital.\r\n\r\n  B. Fortify the points where main lines of communication pass a\r\n  strategic barrier.\r\n\r\n  C. Make an entrenched camp at the most important centre of\r\n  communication in each zone of invasion: and support it by one or two\r\n  places arranged so as to make a fortified district.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Brialmont's _Progres de la defense des etats et de\r\n  la fortification depuis Vauban_, by permission of Commandant G. Meeus.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\n  D. Close with barrier forts the lines necessary to an enemy across\r\n  mountains or marshes.\r\n\r\n  E. Make a central place behind a mountain chain as a pivot for the\r\n  army watching it.\r\n\r\n  F. Defend mountain roads by provisional fortifications.\r\n\r\n  G. Make a large place in each theatre of war which is far from the\r\n  principal theatre, and where the enemy might wish to establish\r\n  himself.\r\n\r\n  H. Fortify coasts and harbours.\r\n\r\n  Objections to these proposals will be readily supplied by the\r\n  officials of the national treasury and the commanders-in-chief of the\r\n  active armies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Types of detached forts.\r\n\r\nSo many types of detached forts have been proposed by competent\r\nauthorities, as well as actually constructed in recent years, that it is\r\nimpossible here to consider all of them, and a few only will be\r\nreproduced of those which are most representative of modern continental\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n  Taking first the type of heavily armed fort, which contains guns for\r\n  the artillery fight as well as safety armament, we must give\r\n  precedence to General Brialmont. The two works here shown are taken\r\n  from the _Progres de la defense des etats, &c._, published in 1898.\r\n  The pentagonal fort (fig. 47) has two special features. In section 1\r\n  is shown a concrete infantry parapet, with a gallery in which the\r\n  defenders of the parapet may take shelter from the bombardment\r\n  preceding an assault. In section 2 it will be seen that the\r\n  counterscarp galleries flanking the ditch are drawn back from the face\r\n  of the counterscarp. This is to counteract proposals that have been\r\n  made to obscure the view from the flanking galleries, and perhaps\r\n  drive the defenders out of them by throwing smoke-producing materials\r\n  into the ditch at the moment of an assault. The arrangement may save\r\n  the occupants of the galleries from excessive heat and noxious fumes,\r\n  but will not of course prevent the smoke from obscuring the view.\r\n\r\n  The following points may be noticed about this design in comparing it\r\n  with earlier types. There is no escarp, the natural slope of the\r\n  rampart being carried down to the bottom of the ditch. There is a\r\n  counterscarp to the faces, but no covered way. The flanks have no\r\n  counterscarp, but a steel fence at the foot of the slope, and the\r\n  covered way which is utilized for a wire entanglement which is under\r\n  the fire of the parapet. The gorge has a very slight bastioned\r\n  indentation, which allows for an efficient flanking of the ditch by a\r\n  couple of machine guns placed in a single casemate on either side.\r\n\r\n  The abolition of the covered way as such is noteworthy. It marks an\r\n  essential difference between the fort and the old enceinte profiles;\r\n  showing that offensive action is not expected from the garrison of the\r\n  fort, and is the duty of the troops of the intermediate lines.\r\n\r\n  The great central mass of concrete containing all the casemates and\r\n  the gun-cupolas, a very popular feature, is omitted in this design,\r\n  advantage being taken of the great lateral extent of the fort to\r\n  spread the casemates under the faces, flanks and gorge, with a\r\n  communication across the centre of the fort. This arrangement gives\r\n  more freedom to the disposition of the cupolas. The thickness of the\r\n  concrete over the casemate arches is more than 8 ft. Communication\r\n  between the faces and the counterscarp galleries is obtained by\r\n  posterns under the ditch. The armament, which is all protected by\r\n  cupolas, is powerful. It consists of two 150-mm. (6 in.) guns, four\r\n  120-mm. (4.7 in.) guns, two 210-mm. (8.4 in.) howitzers, two 210-mm.\r\n  (8.4 in.) mortars, four 57-mm. Q.F. guns for close defence. There is\r\n  also a shielded electric light projector in the centre.\r\n\r\n  This fort is a great advance on General Brialmont's designs before\r\n  1885. These were marked by great complexity of earth parapets and\r\n  various _chicanes_ which would not long survive bombardment. This type\r\n  is simple and powerful. It is also very expensive.\r\n\r\n  The second Brialmont fort (fig. 48) is selected because it shows a\r\n  keep or citadel, an inner work designed to hold out after the capture\r\n  of the outer parapet. General Brialmont held strongly to the necessity\r\n  of keeps for all important works. History of course gives instances of\r\n  citadels which have enabled the garrison to recapture the main work\r\n  with assistance, or caused a really useful delay in the progress of\r\n  the general attack. It affords still more instances in which the keeps\r\n  have made no resistance, or none of any value. Some think that the\r\n  existence of a keep encourages the defenders of the main work; others\r\n  that it encourages the idea of retreat. The British school of thought\r\n  is against keeps. In any case they add largely to expense.\r\n\r\n  In the present design the keep is a mass of concrete, which depends\r\n  for the defence of its front ditches on counterscarp galleries in the\r\n  main work, the few embrasures for frontal defence being practically\r\n  useless. Its main function is to prevent the attackers from\r\n  establishing themselves on the gorge, thus leaving the way open for a\r\n  reinforcement from outside to enter (assisted by bamboo flying\r\n  bridges) through the passages left for the purpose in the outer and\r\n  inner gorge parapets.\r\n\r\n  As regards the main work, the arrangements for defence of the ditch\r\n  and the armament are similar to the design last considered. This\r\n  parapet has no concrete shelter for the defenders. The casemates are\r\n  all collected in the keep and the gorge, with a passage all round\r\n  giving access to the parapet and the cupolas.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Brialmont's _Progres de la defense des etats,\r\n  &c._, by permission of Commandant G. Meeus.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 49.--Fort Molsheim, Strassburg.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 49 is a German work, Fort Molsheim at Strassburg. This is a\r\n  simple type of triangular fort. The main mass of concrete rests on the\r\n  gorge, and is divided by a narrow courtyard to give light and air to\r\n  the front casemates. The fort has a medium armament for the artillery\r\n  fight, consisting of four 6-in. howitzers in cupolas. On each face are\r\n  two small Q.F. guns in cupolas for close defence, for which purpose,\r\n  it will be seen, there is also an infantry parapet. At the angles are\r\n  look-out turrets. The ditch has escarp and counterscarp, and is\r\n  defended by counterscarp galleries at the angles. There is no covered\r\n  way. The thickness of concrete over the casemates, where it is\r\n  uncovered, is about 10 ft.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 50 is Fort Lyngby at Copenhagen. The new Copenhagen defences are\r\n  very interesting, giving evidence of clear and original thought, and\r\n  effectiveness combined with economy. There is one special feature\r\n  worth noting about the outer ring of forts, of which Lyngby is one.\r\n  These works are intended for the artillery fight only, their main\r\n  armament being four 6-in. guns (in pairs) and three 6-in. howitzers,\r\n  all in cupolas. The armament for immediate defence is trifling,\r\n  consisting of only two 57-mm. guns and a machine-gun. There is no\r\n  provision for infantry defence. The ditch has no escarp or\r\n  counterscarp, and is flanked by counterscarp galleries at the salient.\r\n\r\n  It is usual in the case of works so slightly organized for their own\r\n  defence, and intended only for the long-range artillery fight, to\r\n  withdraw them somewhat from the front line. The Danish engineers,\r\n  however, have not hesitated to put these works in the very front line,\r\n  some 2000 metres in front of the permanent intermediate batteries. The\r\n  object of this is to force the enemy to establish his heavy artillery\r\n  at such long ranges that it will be able to afford little assistance\r\n  to the trench attack of the infantry. The intermediate batteries,\r\n  being withdrawn, are comparatively safe. They therefore do not require\r\n  expensive protection, and can reserve their strength to resist the\r\n  advance of the attack. The success of this arrangement will depend on\r\n  the fighting strength of the cupolas under war conditions; and what\r\n  that may be, war alone can tell us.\r\n\r\n  In the details of these works, besides the bold cutting down of\r\n  defensive precautions, we may note the skilful and economical use of\r\n  layers of large stones over the casemates to diminish the thickness of\r\n  concrete required. The roofs of the casemates are stiffened underneath\r\n  with steel rails, and steel lathing is used to prevent lumps of\r\n  concrete from falling on the occupants. The living casemates look out\r\n  on the gorge, getting plenty of light and air, while the magazines are\r\n  under the cupolas.\r\n\r\n  The forts above described are all armed with a view to their taking an\r\n  important part in the distant artillery fight. The next type to be\r\n  considered (fig. 51) is selected mainly because it is a good example\r\n  of the use of concealed flanking batteries, known on the continent as\r\n  _batteries traditores_, which seem to be growing in popularity.\r\n\r\n  This design by Colonel Voorduin of the Dutch engineers has a medium\r\n  armament, which is not intended for the artillery duel, but to command\r\n  the immediate front of the neighbouring forts and the intervals. The\r\n  fort is long and narrow, with small casemate accommodation. It\r\n  contains eight 4.7-in. guns. Two of these are in a cupola concealed\r\n  from view, though not protected, by a bank of earth in front. The\r\n  other six are in an armoured battery behind the cupola. It may be\r\n  remarked that as the cupola gets no real protection from the covering\r\n  mass of earth, it would be better to be able to utilize the fire of\r\n  its guns to the front. The _batterie traditore_, if properly protected\r\n  overhead, would be very difficult to silence, and its flanking fire\r\n  would probably be available up to the last moment. There is very much\r\n  to be said both for and against the policy of so emplacing the guns.\r\n  The immediate defence of the work, with the aid of a broad wet ditch,\r\n  is easy; but the great mass of concrete, which is intended to form an\r\n  indestructible platform and breastwork for the infantry, would seem to\r\n  be a needless expense.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Brialmont's _Progres de la defense des etats,\r\n  &c._, by permission of Commandant G. Meeus.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 50.--Fort Lyngby, Copenhagen.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Leithner's _Bestandige Befestigung_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 52, designed by the Austrian lieutenant field-marshal Moritz\r\n  Ritter von Brunner (1839-1904), is selected as a type of the\r\n  intermediate fort which is intended only to be a strong point in the\r\n  infantry line of defence between the main forts. It has a protected\r\n  armament, but this, which consists only of four small Q.F. guns in\r\n  cupolas, is for its own defence, and not to take part in the artillery\r\n  duel. There is also a movable armament of four light Q.F. guns on\r\n  wheels, for which a shelter is provided between the two observatory\r\n  cupolas. The garrison would be a half company of infantry, for whom\r\n  casemates are provided in the gorge. The gorge ditch is flanked by a\r\n  caponier, but there is no flank defence for the front ditch. This is\r\n  defended by a glacis parapet. At the bottom of the ditch is a wire\r\n  entanglement and the glacis slope is planted with thorns. The\r\n  thickness of concrete on the casemates is 2 metres (6 ft. 7 in.). This\r\n  is a strong and simple form of infantry work, but considering its role\r\n  it appears to be needlessly expensive.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 53 is an Italian type of barrier fort in mountainous country. A\r\n  powerful battery of eight medium guns protected by a Gruson shield\r\n  commands the approach. The fort with its dwelling casemates is\r\n  surrounded by a deep ditch flanked by counterscarp galleries. There\r\n  are certain apparent weaknesses in the type, but the difficulties of\r\n  the attack in such country and its limitations must be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n_Modern Details of Protection and Obstacle._--After considering the\r\nabove types of fort, it will be of use to note some of the details in\r\nwhich modern construction has been modified to provide against the\r\nincreasing power of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Brialmont's _Progres de la defense des etats, &c._,\r\nby permission of Commandant G. Meeus.\r\n\r\nFIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bomb-proof protection.\r\n\r\nThe penetration of projectiles varies according to the nature of the\r\nsoil--the lighter the better for protection. Sand offers the greatest\r\nresistance to penetration, clay the least. Since, however, the\r\npenetration of heavy shells fired from long ranges with high elevation\r\nmay be 20 ft. or more in ordinary soil, we can no longer look to earth\r\nalone as a source of protection against bombardment. Again a moderate\r\nquantity of earth over a casemate increases the explosive effect of a\r\nshell by \"tamping\" it, that is by preventing the force of the explosion\r\nfrom being wasted in the open air. We find therefore that in most modern\r\ndesigns the tops of casemates are left uncovered, or with only a few\r\ninches of earth over them, in which grass may be grown for concealment.\r\n\r\nFor the materials of casemates and revetment walls exposed to fire,\r\nconcrete (q.v.) has entirely replaced masonry and brickwork, not because\r\nof its convenience in construction, but because it offers the best\r\nresistance. The exact composition of the concrete is a matter that\r\ndemands great care and knowledge. It should be, like an armour plate,\r\nhard on the surface and tough within. The great thickness of 10 ft. of\r\nconcrete for casemate arches, very generally prescribed on the continent\r\nin important positions, is meant to meet the danger of several\r\nsuccessive shells striking the same spot. To stop a single shell of any\r\nsiege calibre in use at present, 5 ft. of good concrete would be enough.\r\nA good deal is expected from the use of \"reinforced concrete\" (that is\r\nconcrete strengthened by steel) both for revetment walls and casemates.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Parapets.\r\n\r\nParapets are frequently made continuous or glacis-wise, that is the\r\nsuperior slope is prolonged to the bottom of the ditch so that the whole\r\nrampart can be swept by the fire of the defenders from the crest, and\r\nthere is no dead ground in front of it. It is also common to build the\r\ncrest of the parapet in solid concrete, with sometimes a concrete\r\nbanquette, so that bombardment shall not destroy the line the defenders\r\nhave to man in repelling an assault. This concrete parapet may be\r\nfurther reinforced by hinged steel bullet-proof plates, to give head\r\ncover; which when not in use hang down behind the crest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From General Rocchi's _Traccia per lo studio della\r\nfortificazione_, by permission.\r\n\r\nFIG. 53.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe escarp is falling into disfavour, on account of the great expense of\r\na revetment that can withstand breaching fire. A counterscarp of very\r\nsolid construction is generally used. It is low and gives cover to a\r\nwire entanglement in the ditch. This may be supplemented by a steel\r\nunclimbable fence, and by entanglements or thorn plantations on the\r\ncovered way and the lower slopes of the parapet. Entanglements are\r\nattached to steel posts bedded in concrete. The upper parts of\r\nrevetments and the foundations of walls are protected against the action\r\nof shells, that falling steeply might act as mines to overturn them, by\r\nthick aprons of large stones. Fig. 54 shows most of these dispositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Search-lights.\r\n\r\nElectric search-lights are now used in all important works and\r\nbatteries. They are usually placed in disappearing cupolas. They are of\r\ngreat value for discovering working parties at night, and lighting up\r\nthe foreground during an attack; and since only the projector need be\r\nexposed, they are not very vulnerable. Their value, however, must not be\r\nover-estimated. The most powerful search-light can in no way compare\r\nwith daylight as an illuminant, and, like all other mechanical\r\ncontrivances, they have certain marked drawbacks in war. They may give\r\nrise to a false confidence; an important light may fail at a critical\r\nmoment; and in foggy weather they are useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Armour.\r\n\r\nThe use of armour (see also ARMOUR-PLATES) for coast batteries followed\r\nclosely upon its employment for ships, for those were the days of short\r\nranges and close fighting, and it seemed natural not to leave the\r\nbattery in a position of inferiority to the ship in the matter of\r\nprotection. In England the coast battery for a generation after the\r\nCrimean War was a combination of masonry and iron; and in 1860 Brialmont\r\nemployed armoured turrets at Antwerp in the forts which commanded the\r\nScheldt. For land defence purposes, however, engineers were very slow to\r\nadopt armour. Apart from all questions of difficulty of manufacture,\r\nexpense, &c., the idea was that sea and land fronts were radically\r\ndifferent. It was pointed out that a ship gun, fired from an unsteady\r\nplatform, had not enough accuracy to strike repeated blows on the same\r\nspot; so that a shield which was strong enough to resist a single shot\r\nwould give complete protection. A battery on a land front, on the other\r\nhand, was exposed to an accurate fire from guns which could strike\r\nsuccessive blows on the same spot, and break down the resistance of the\r\nstrongest shield. But in time continental opinion gradually began to\r\nturn in favour of iron protection. Practical types of disappearing and\r\nrevolving cupolas were produced, and many engineers were influenced in\r\ntheir favour by the effect of the big high-explosive shell. Eventually\r\nit was argued that, after all, the object of fortification is not to\r\nobtain a resisting power without limit, but to put the men and guns of a\r\nwork in an advantageous position to defend themselves as long as\r\npossible against a superior force; and that from this point of view\r\narmour cannot but add strength to defensive works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Deguise's _La Fortification permanente_, by\r\npermission of J. Polleunis.\r\n\r\nFIG. 54.]\r\n\r\nThe question has of course long passed beyond the stage of theory.\r\nPractically every European state uses iron or steel casemates and\r\ncupolas. German, Danish, Italian and other types of forts so armed have\r\nbeen shown. Recent French types have not been published, but it is known\r\nthat cupolas are employed; and Velichko, the Russian authority, long an\r\nuncompromising opponent of armour, in the end changed his views. These\r\ncountries have had to proceed gradually, by improving existing\r\nfortresses, and with such resources as could be spared from the needs of\r\nthe active armies. Among the smaller states Rumania and Belgium have\r\nentered most freely into the new way. In England, which is less directly\r\ninterested, opinion has been led by Sir George Clarke, since the\r\npublication in 1890 of his well-known book on fortification. Having\r\nwitnessed officially the experiments at Bucharest in 1885 with a St\r\nChamond turret and a Gruson cupola, he expressed himself very strongly\r\nagainst the whole system. Besides pointing out very clearly the\r\ntheoretical objections to it, and the weak points of the constructions\r\nunder experiment, he added: \"The cost of the French turret was about\r\nL10,000 exclusive of its armament, and for this sum about six movable\r\noverbank guns of greater power could be provided.\" In view of the weight\r\nthat belongs of right to his criticisms it is as well to point out that\r\nwhile this remark is quite true, yet the six guns would require also six\r\ngun detachments, with arrangements for supply, &c.; a consideration\r\nwhich alters the working of this apparently elementary sum. The whole\r\nobject of protection is to enable a few men and guns successfully to\r\noppose a larger number.\r\n\r\n  At the time when Sir George Clarke's first edition came out, such\r\n  extravagances were before the public as Mougin's fort; \"a mastless\r\n  turret ship,\" as he called it, \"buried up to the deck-level in the\r\n  ground and manned by mechanics.\" Such ideas tended to throw discredit\r\n  on the more reasonable use of armour, but whether the system be right\r\n  or wrong, it exists now and has to be taken account of. Nowhere has it\r\n  been applied more boldly than in Rumania. The defences of Bucharest\r\n  (designed by Brialmont) consist of 18 main and 18 small forts, with\r\n  intermediate batteries. The main forts are some 4500 yds. apart, and\r\n  11,000 to 12,000 yds. from the centre of the place. The typical\r\n  armament of a main fort is six 6-in. guns in three cupolas (one for\r\n  indirect fire), two 8.4-in. howitzers in cupolas, one 4.7-in. howitzer\r\n  in a cupola, six small Q.F. guns in disappearing cupolas. The total\r\n  armament of the place (all protected) is eighty-six 6-in. guns,\r\n  seventy-four 8.4-in. howitzers, eighteen 4.7-in. howitzers, 127 small\r\n  calibre Q.F. guns in disappearing cupolas, 476 small calibre Q.F. guns\r\n  in casemates for flanking the ditches. The \"Sereth Line\" will be\r\n  described later.\r\n\r\n_Different Forms of Protection: Casemate, Cupola, &c._--The broad\r\ndifference between casemates or shielded batteries and turrets and\r\ncupolas is that the former are fixed while the latter revolve and in\r\nsome cases disappear. The casemate thus has the disadvantages that the\r\narc of fire of the gun, which has to fire through a fixed embrasure or\r\nport-hole, is very limited, and that the muzzle of the gun and the\r\nport-hole, the weak points of the system, are constantly exposed to the\r\nfire of the enemy. The advantage of the casemate lies in its comparative\r\ncheapness and the greater strength of a fixed structure. It is well\r\nsuited for barrier forts (fig. 53) and other analogous positions; and\r\nthe Italians amongst other nations have so employed it at such places as\r\nthe end of the Mont Cenis tunnel. Steel and iron casemates are also\r\nuseful as caponiers for ditch flanking (fig. 55).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Leithner's _Bestandige Befestigung_, by permission.\r\n\r\nFIG. 55.]\r\n\r\n_Turrets and Cupolas._--The difference between a turret and a cupola is\r\nthat the former is cylindrical with a flat or nearly flat top and\r\npresents a vertical target; while the latter is a flattened dome, the\r\nvertical supports of which are entirely concealed. The turret appears to\r\nbe little used. The object of both forms is at once to give an all-round\r\narc of fire to the guns and to allow of the weak point of the structure,\r\nthe port-hole and muzzle of the gun, being turned away from the enemy in\r\nthe intervals of firing. Both usually emerge from a mass of concrete,\r\nwhich is strengthened round the opening by a collar of chilled cast iron\r\nabout 12 to 15 in. thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cupolas.\r\n\r\n  There are four types of cupolas, viz. (a) Disappearing, (b)\r\n  Oscillating, (c) Central pivot, (d) On roller rings.\r\n\r\n  (a) Disappearing cupolas are used chiefly for small quick-firing guns,\r\n  on account of the expense of the various systems. They can be used for\r\n  medium guns. The details of the best foreign systems are secret. (b)\r\n  The oscillating turret is a Mougin type, in which the turret is\r\n  supported in the centre by a knife-edge on which it can swing. The\r\n  oscillation is controlled by powerful springs. The effect of it is\r\n  that after firing, the front of the cupola with the port-hole swings\r\n  downwards under cover, and is held there until the gun is ready to\r\n  fire again. (c) Schumann's centre pivot is understood to be approved\r\n  in Germany. It has been adopted in Rumania and Belgium for howitzer\r\n  cupolas. It is only suitable for a single piece; d is strong and\r\n  steady--the best cupola for coast batteries; c and d are best for\r\n  rapid fire because they can be loaded without lowering. They are\r\n  suited for long guns.\r\n\r\n  The following types are illustrated as being generally representative\r\n  of the different classes of cupola.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Cupola for 6-in. gun (Friedr. Krupp A.G.).]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 56 is a section of Messrs Krupp's typical cupola for one 6-in.\r\n  gun. The shield is of nickel steel, the collar of cast steel. A small\r\n  space is left between the cupola and its collar to prevent the\r\n  possibility of the shield jamming after being damaged. The guns are\r\n  muzzle-pivoting and thickened out near the muzzle by the addition of a\r\n  ring, so as to close the port as much as possible. The recoil is\r\n  controlled within narrow limits both to economize space and to prevent\r\n  the smoke from the muzzle from getting into the cupola. To facilitate\r\n  the elevation and depression of the gun (with muzzle pivotings the\r\n  breech has of course to be moved through a much larger arc than with\r\n  ordinary mountings) it is balanced by a counterweight. The cupola\r\n  rests on a roller ring and is traversed by a winch. It can be turned\r\n  through a complete circle in about one minute.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Leithner's _Bestandige Befestigung_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57.--Gruson Spherical Mortar.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 57 shows a Schumann shielded mortar (sphere-mortar,\r\n  _Kugelmorser_). In this case it will be observed that the cupola is\r\n  replaced by an enlargement of the encircling collar; and the mortar\r\n  (8.4-in. calibre) is enclosed in a sphere of cast iron, so as to close\r\n  completely the opening of the collar in any position.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 58 shows a Gruson cupola for one 4.7-in. Q.F. howitzer.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 59 shows a disappearing turret for an electric light projector.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 60 shows a Krupp transportable cupola for a 5.7-cm. gun. This is\r\n  drawn on a four-wheeled carriage, and when coming into action slides\r\n  on rollers on to a platform in the parapet. It weighs about 2-1/2 tons,\r\n  and with carriage and platform about 4 tons.\r\n\r\n  The mechanism of these cupolas is for the most part simpler than it\r\n  appears. Counterweights and hand winches are much in use for the\r\n  lighter natures of guns. The armouring of course keeps pace with\r\n  improvements in manufacture. The chilled cast iron first made popular\r\n  by the Gruson firm is now little used except for such purposes as the\r\n  collar round a cupola. Wrought iron, steel and compound plates for the\r\n  tops of cupolas have all been tried, the most recent Krupp-Gruson\r\n  designs being of nickel steel.\r\n\r\n  The sighting in some cases may be done by sights on the gun, with\r\n  suitable enlargements in the port-hole; in others by sights affixed to\r\n  the cupola itself (which of course can give horizontal direction\r\n  only); in others training and elevation are given in accordance with\r\n  the readings on electric dials, or instructions by telephone or\r\n  speaking tube. There is of course nothing unreasonable in this in the\r\n  case of indirect fire guns and howitzers, for if not firing from\r\n  cupolas they would be behind the shelter of some wood or quarry.\r\n\r\n  _Schumann's System: \"Armoured Fronts.\"_--Lieut.-Colonel Maximilian\r\n  Schumann (1827-1889) of the Prussian engineers, who took a very\r\n  prominent part in the design and advocacy of armoured defences,\r\n  eventually produced a system which dispensed entirely with forts and\r\n  relied on the fire of protected guns. It consists of several lines of\r\n  batteries for Q.F. guns and howitzers in cupolas. He considered that\r\n  such batteries would be able to defend their own front, and the\r\n  infantry garrison was not to be called into action except in the case\r\n  of the enemy breaking through at some point of the line.\r\n\r\n  This system was actually adopted by Rumania (1889-1892) for the Sereth\r\n  Line. There are three routes by which the Russians can enter the\r\n  country across the Sereth river: through Focshani, Nemolassa and\r\n  Galatz. These three routes are barred by bridge-heads, those at\r\n  Focshani, the most important, being on the left bank of the Milkov, a\r\n  tributary of the Sereth.\r\n\r\n  The Focshani works consist of 71 batteries arranged on a semicircular\r\n  front about 12 m. long and from 8000 to 10,000 yds. in advance of the\r\n  bridges. The batteries are placed in three lines, which are about 500\r\n  yds. apart, and are subdivided into groups. The normal group consists\r\n  of 5 batteries, of which 3 are in the first line, 1 in the second, and\r\n  1 in the third. The first-line batteries each contain five small Q.F.\r\n  guns in travelling cupolas. The second-line batteries, each six small\r\n  Q.F. guns in disappearing cupolas. The third-line batteries have one\r\n  120-mm. gun in a cupola, and two 210-mm. spherical mortars with Gruson\r\n  shields. The immediate defence of the batteries consists of a glacis\r\n  planted with thorn bushes and a wire entanglement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Leithner's _Bestandige Befestigung_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.--Cupola for 4.7-in. Howitzer.]\r\n\r\n  The fortification of these three bridge-heads are said to have cost\r\n  about L1,100,000. But the system of \"armoured fronts\" is never likely\r\n  to be reproduced, having been condemned by all authoritative\r\n  continental opinion. Its defects have been summarized by Schroeter as\r\n  follows: weakness of artillery at long ranges, want of security\r\n  against a surprise rush, the neglect of the use of infantry in the\r\n  defence, and the difficulty of command. This last is the most serious\r\n  of all. It is indeed difficult to conceive that any one should expect\r\n  half-a-dozen expert gunners, each shut up in an iron box with a gun,\r\n  to stop the rush of a thousand men, even by day. But imagine the\r\n  feelings of the gunner on the night of a big attack, alone in his box,\r\n  his nerves already strained by a preliminary bombardment and nights of\r\n  watching. He hears the sounds of battle all around; he knows nothing\r\n  of the progress of the attack, but expects everything, and feels every\r\n  moment the door of his box being opened and the bayonet entering his\r\n  back. No wise commander would submit his troops to such a test.\r\n\r\n_Sir George Clarke and Unarmoured Systems._--Before leaving the subject\r\nof fortresses it is necessary to consider the ideas of those who, while\r\nrecognizing the necessity for places permanently organized for defence,\r\nprefer to treat them more from the point of view of perfected field\r\ndefences. It is to the credit of English military science that Sir\r\nGeorge Clarke may be taken as the representative of this school of\r\nthought. His study of fortification, as he tells us, began with a\r\nhistory of the defence of Plevna (q.v.). He was led to compare the\r\nresistance made behind extemporized defences at such places as\r\nSevastopol, Kars and Plevna, with those at other places fortified in the\r\nmost complete manner known to science. From this comparison he drew the\r\nconclusion that the true strength of fortification does not depend on\r\ngreat masonry works intricately pieced together at vast expense, but on\r\norganization, communications and invisibility. In his 1907 edition he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  \"Future defences will divide themselves naturally into the following\r\n  categories: (1) Permanent works wholly constructed in peace time and\r\n  forming the key points of the position. (2) Gun emplacements,\r\n  magazines and shelters for men in rear of the main line, all concrete\r\n  structures and platforms to be completed, though some earthwork may be\r\n  left until the position is placed in a state of defence. (3) Field\r\n  works, trenches, &c., guarding the intervals between the permanent\r\n  defences in the main line, or providing rear positions. These should\r\n  be deliberately planned in time of peace ready to be put in hand at\r\n  short notice. The essence of a well-fortified position is that the\r\n  weapons of the defender shall obtain the utmost possible scope of\r\n  action, and that those of the attacker shall have the minimum chances\r\n  of effecting injury.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawn from illustration in Leithner's _Bestandige\r\nBefestigung_, by permission.\r\n\r\nFIG. 59.--Disappearing Turret for Searchlight.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Infantry redoubts.\r\n\r\nSince Sir George Clarke published his first edition in 1890 continental\r\nideas have expanded a good deal. The foregoing statement as to the three\r\ncategories of defences would be accepted anywhere now: the differences\r\nof opinion come in when we reach the stage of classifying under the\r\nfirst head the permanent works to be constructed in peace time. In most\r\ncountries these would include forts with guns for the artillery duel,\r\nforts with safety armaments, fixed batteries with or without armour, and\r\nforts for infantry only. Sir George Clarke will have no armour for guns\r\nexcept in certain special cases of barrier forts. Heavy guns and\r\nhowitzers requiring permanent emplacements (concrete platforms, &c.)\r\nmust either be well concealed or be provided with alternative positions.\r\nThe only permanent works which he admits are for infantry. They are\r\nredoubts of simple form intended for 350 or 400 men, with casemate\r\naccommodation for three-fourths of that number. Fig. 61 shows the\r\ndesign:--two rows of casemates, one under the front parapet, one under a\r\nparados; frontal musketry defence; obstacle consisting of entanglements,\r\nmines, &c., with or without escarp and counterscarp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Transportable Cupola for 5.7-cm. Gun (Friedr.\r\nKrupp A.G.).]\r\n\r\n  \"The intervals (he says) between the infantry redoubts may be about\r\n  2500 yds.; but this will necessarily depend upon the conformation of\r\n  the ground. Where there are good artillery positions falling within\r\n  the sphere of protection of the redoubts, large intervals will be\r\n  permissible. Thus, in the case of an extended line of defence where\r\n  the ground offers marked tactical features, the idea of a continuous\r\n  chain of permanent works may be abandoned in favour of groups of\r\n  redoubts guarding the artillery positions. In this case, the redoubts\r\n  in a group might be distributed on a curve bent back in approximately\r\n  horse-shoe form.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Sir George S. Clarke's Fortification, by permission\r\nof John Murray.\r\n\r\nFIG. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe keystones of the close defence of the fighting line in future will\r\nundoubtedly be these infantry redoubts, and therefore it is of great\r\ninterest to compare with the above types two studies put forward by\r\nSchroeter (_Die Festung in der heutigen Kriegfuhrung_), one in his first\r\nedition in 1898 (fig. 62), and the other in the second in 1905 (fig.\r\n63). In both these the defensive arrangements are merely trenches of\r\nfield profile with entanglements, the command and the obstacle being\r\nless than in Sir George Clarke's work; and it will be noticed that in\r\nthe 1905 type, published after the Russo-Japanese War, the plan is much\r\nless simple and arrangements for close flanking defence have been\r\nintroduced. But these works of Schroeter's are merely infantry\r\nsupporting points in a line which contains forts of the triangular type\r\nwith guns, and armoured batteries, as well as a very complete\r\narrangement of field defences and communications; while Sir G. Clarke's\r\nredoubts are the only permanent works giving casemate protection in the\r\nfront line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Schoeter's Die Festung in der heutigen Kriegfuhrung,\r\nby permission of E.S. Mittler u. Sohn.\r\n\r\nFIG. 62.]\r\n\r\nThe comparative merits of either design for an infantry redoubt are not\r\nof much importance. It is agreed that the main line of defence must\r\nconsist of a more or less continuous line of field defences and\r\nobstacles, and that at some points in the line there should be infantry\r\nsupporting points with bomb-proof protection capable of resisting big\r\nshells. The open question is, what additional works, if any, are\r\nrequired for the artillery, whether for the medium and heavy guns that\r\nwill take part in the \"artillery duel,\" or for the lighter natures that\r\nwill help in the close fight and defence of the intervals. Is it best\r\nfor the defenders to rely on armoured protection or on concealment for\r\nhis guns?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Opposing views as to armour, gun positions, &c.\r\n\r\nOfficial opinion outside England has certainly sanctioned armour, since\r\nall over the continent it is to some extent adopted in practice.\r\nNational practice is usually based on the advice of the most\r\ndistinguished officers of the day, and therefore it is unsafe to condemn\r\nit hastily. Sir George Clarke and those who are with him--and they are\r\nmany, both in Great Britain and abroad--object entirely to armour. He\r\nsays (_Fortification_, ed. 1907, p. 96): \"The great advantage possessed\r\nby the attack in all ages has been the employment of a mobile artillery\r\nagainst armaments cribbed, cabined and confined by fortification. It is\r\nnecessary to perpetuate this advantage?\" Of course the effect of\r\nlong-range weapons, in increasing the length of front that can be held\r\nby a given force, has given much greater freedom of action to the\r\ndefence and this should be taken full advantage of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Schroeter's _Die Festung in der heutigen\r\nKriegfuhrung_, by permission of E.S. Mittler u. Sohn.\r\n\r\nFIG. 63.]\r\n\r\nThe argument as to the vulnerability of shielded guns is not at present\r\nstrong. Sir George says (ib. p. 94), \"If the high angle fire ... is ever\r\nto find a favourable opportunity, it will surely be against a cupola,\r\nthe site of which can generally be determined with accuracy.\" On the\r\nother hand he says (p. 90), \"During the long and costly experiments\r\ncarried on at Bucharest in 1885-1886, 164 rounds were fired from the\r\nKrupp 21 cm. mortar at targets of about 40 sq. metres area\" (about 430\r\nsq. ft.) \"without obtaining a single hit. The range was 2700 yds.; the\r\ntargets were towers built upon a level plain; the shooting conditions\r\nwere ideal, and the fall of each shell was telephoned back to the firing\r\npoint; but it must have been evident to the least instructed observer\r\nthat to attempt to group 6 or 8 shells on an invisible area 2 metres\r\nsquare would have been absolutely futile.\" These facts are adduced to\r\nprove that it is not necessary to give great thickness to concrete\r\ncasemates, to resist successive bursts of shells in the same place; but\r\nsurely they are equally applicable to cupolas. Again (p. 252), \"The\r\nexperience gained at Port Arthur was not altogether encouraging as\r\nregards the use of high angle fire. The Russian vessels in the harbour\r\nwere sunk by opening their sea-valves.... Fire was subsequently directed\r\nupon them from 11 in. howitzers at ranges up to about 7500 yds. This was\r\ndeliberate practice from siege batteries at stationary targets; but the\r\neffect was distinctly disappointing.\" The cupolas therefore can hardly\r\nbe considered ideal targets: and the probability is that they would hold\r\ntheir own against both direct and indirect fire for a long time. There\r\nare other and stronger arguments against the general use of them, all of\r\nwhich are clearly set forth by Sir George Clarke.\r\n\r\nThe worst objections to the cupola are the military disadvantages of\r\nisolation and immobility, and the multiplication of mechanical\r\narrangements. For a successful round from a disappearing cupola, the\r\nelevating and traversing arrangements, the elevating and loading gear of\r\nthe gun, and the telephone communication, must all be in good order. At\r\nnight the successful co-operation of the searchlight is also in many\r\ncases necessary.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of history is all against immobile mechanical defences.\r\nInitiative, surprise, unforeseen offensive action, keeping the besieger\r\nin ignorance of the dispositions of the garrison, and of what progress\r\nhe is making: all these, with their influence on the morale of both\r\nsides, tend towards successful defences and do not point towards the use\r\nof armour.\r\n\r\nIt may further be said that the use of armour as a general rule is\r\nunnecessary, because a concealed battery is a protected one; and with\r\nthe long ranges now usual for heavy guns and howitzers, there is not\r\ngenerally much difficulty about concealment.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion, however, of the present writer an exception must be made\r\nfor guns intended to flank the line of defence, which would generally\r\nneed bomb-proof over-head cover. Further, when we leave theory and come\r\nto the consideration of actual problems of defence, it will often be\r\nfound that it is necessary to place guns in certain positions where good\r\nconcealment cannot be got. In such cases some form of protection must be\r\ngiven if the guns are to engage the concealed batteries of the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE ATTACK OF FORTRESSES\r\n\r\nIn considering the history of siegecraft since the introduction of\r\ngunpowder, there are three main lines of development to follow, viz. the\r\ngradually increasing power of artillery, the systematizing of the works\r\nof attack, and in recent times the change that has been brought about by\r\nthe effect of modern small-arm fire.\r\n\r\nCannon appear to have been first used in sieges as mortars, to destroy\r\nhoardings by throwing round stones and barrels of burning composition.\r\nEarly in the 15th century we find cannon throwing metal balls, not only\r\nagainst hoarding and battlements, but also to breach the bases of the\r\nwalls. It was only possible to work the guns very slowly, and archers or\r\ncrossbowmen were needed in support of them, to drive the defenders from\r\nthe crenellations or loopholes of the battlements. At that period the\r\nartillery was used in place of the medieval siege engines and in much\r\nthe same manner. The guns of the defence were inaccurate, and being\r\nplaced high on the walls were made ineffective by bad mountings, which\r\ndid not allow of proper depression. The besieger therefore could place\r\nhis guns close to the walls, with only the protection of a few large\r\ngabions filled with earth, set up on the ground on either side of the\r\nmuzzle.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the 15th century the power of artillery was largely\r\nincreased, so that walls and gates were destroyed by it in an\r\nastonishingly short time. Three results shortly followed. The guns of\r\nthe defence having gained equally in effectiveness, greater protection\r\nwas needed for the attack batteries; bastions and outworks were\r\nintroduced to keep the besieger at a distance from the inner walls; and\r\nthe walls were sunk in ditches so that they could only be breached by\r\nbatteries placed on the edge of the glacis.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 16th century fortresses were being rapidly remodelled on\r\nthese lines, and the difficulties of the attack were at once very much\r\nincreased. The tendency of the assailants was still to make for the\r\ncurtain, which had always been considered the weak point; but the\r\nbesiegers now found that they had to bring their guns right up to the\r\nedge of the ditch before they could make a breach, and in doing so had\r\nto pass over ground which was covered by the converging fire from the\r\nfaces of the bastions. Towards the end of the century the attack of the\r\ncurtain was delayed and the cross-fire over the ground in front\r\nincreased by the introduction of ravelins.\r\n\r\nThe slight gabion protection for the siege batteries was at first\r\nreplaced by strong timber shelters. These were found inadequate; but a\r\nstill greater difficulty was that of bringing up the siege guns to their\r\npositions, emplacing them and maintaining communication with them under\r\nfire. In addition to this, the guns of the defence until they could be\r\noverpowered (a slow process) dominated a wide belt of ground in front of\r\nthe fortress; and unless the besiegers could find some means of\r\nmaintaining a strong guard close to their batteries these were liable to\r\nbe destroyed by sorties from the covered way.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Siegecraft before Vauban.\r\n\r\nGradually the whole problem of siege work centred round the artillery.\r\nThe besiegers found that they had first to bring up enough guns to\r\noverpower those of the defence; then to advance their guns to positions\r\nfrom which they could breach the walls; and throughout these operations\r\nto protect them against sorties. Breaches once made, the assault could\r\nfollow on the old lines.\r\n\r\nThe natural solution of the difficulty of approach to the battery\r\npositions was the use of trenches. The Turks were the first to make\r\nsystematic use of them, having probably inherited the idea from the\r\nEastern Empire. The soldiers of Christendom, however, strongly disliked\r\ndigging, and at first great leaders like Bayard and Montluc had\r\nthemselves to use pick and shovel, to give their men an example. In due\r\ncourse the necessity of the trenches was recognized, but the soldiers\r\nnever took kindly to them, and the difficulty was dealt with in a manner\r\nreminiscent of the feudal ages, by impressing large bodies of peasantry\r\nas workmen whenever a siege was in contemplation.\r\n\r\nThrough the 16th and most of the 17th century, therefore, we find the\r\nattack being conducted by means of trenches leading to the batteries,\r\nand supported by redoubts often called \"places of arms\" also made by\r\ntrench work. During this period the result of a siege was always\r\ndoubtful. Both trenches and batteries were arranged more or less at\r\nhaphazard without any definite plan; and naturally it often happened\r\nthat offensive action by the besieged against the trenches would\r\ndisorder the attack and at times delay it indefinitely. Fig. 64, taken\r\nfrom a late 17th-century print by de Fer of Paris, gives a good idea of\r\nthe general practice of that day when Vauban's methods were not yet\r\ngenerally known.\r\n\r\nAnother weak point about the attack was that after the escarp walls had\r\nbeen strengthened to resist artillery fire as has been described, there\r\nwas no clear idea as to how they should be breached. The usual process\r\nwas merely an indiscriminate pounding from batteries established on the\r\ncrest of the glacis. Thus there were cases of sieges being abandoned\r\nafter they had been carried as far as the attempt to breach.\r\n\r\nIt is in no way strange that this want of method should have\r\ncharacterized the attack for two centuries after artillery had begun to\r\nassert its power. At the outset many new ideas had to be assimilated.\r\nGuns were gradually growing in power; sieges were conducted under all\r\nsorts of conditions, sometimes against medieval castles, sometimes\r\nagainst various and widely-differing examples of the new fortification;\r\nand the military systems of the time were not favourable to the\r\nevolution of method. It is the special feature of Vauban's practical\r\ngenius for siege warfare that he introduced order into this chaos and\r\nmade the issue of a siege under normal conditions, a mere matter of\r\ntime, usually a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vauban's teaching.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Vauban's teaching and practice cannot be condensed into the\r\nlimits of this article, but special reference must be made to several\r\npoints. The most important of these is his general arrangement of the\r\nattack. The ultimate object of the attack works was to make a breach for\r\nthe assaulting columns. To do this it was necessary to establish\r\nbreaching batteries on the crest of the glacis; and before this could be\r\ndone it was necessary to overpower the enemy's artillery. This\r\npreliminary operation is nowadays called the \"artillery duel.\" In\r\nVauban's day the effective range of guns was 600 to 700 yds. He tells us\r\nthat it was customary to establish batteries at 1000 yds. from the\r\nplace, but that at that range they did little more than make a great\r\ndeal of noise. The first object of the attack, therefore, after the\r\npreliminary operations of investment, &c., had been completed, was to\r\nestablish batteries within 600 or 700 yds. of the place, to\r\ncounter-batter or enfilade all the faces bearing on the front of attack;\r\nand to protect these batteries against sorties. After the artillery of\r\nthe defences had been subdued--if it could not be absolutely\r\nsilenced--it was necessary to push trenches to the front so that guns\r\nmight be conveyed to the breaching positions and emplaced there in\r\nbatteries. Throughout these processes it was necessary to protect the\r\nworking parties and the batteries against sorties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Siege-works of the 17th century.]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Vauban devised the _Places d'armes_ or _lignes\r\nparalleles_. He tells us that they were first used in 1673 at the siege\r\nof Maestricht, where he conducted the attack, and which was captured in\r\nthirteen days after the opening of the trenches. The object of these\r\nparallels was to provide successive positions for the guard of the\r\ntrenches, where they could be at hand to repel sorties. The latter were\r\nmost commonly directed against the trenches and batteries, to destroy\r\nthem and drive out the working parties. The most vulnerable points were\r\nthe heads of the approach trenches. It was necessary, therefore, that\r\nthe guard of the trenches should be in a position to reach the heads of\r\nthe approaches more quickly than the besieged could do so from the\r\ncovered way. This was provided for as follows.\r\n\r\nThe first parallel was usually established at about 600 yds. from the\r\nplace, this being considered the limiting range of action of a sortie.\r\nThe parallel was a trench 12 to 15 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep, the\r\nexcavated earth being thrown forward to make a parapet 3 or 4 ft. high.\r\nIn front of the first parallel and close to it were placed the batteries\r\nof the \"first artillery position.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  The attack.\r\n\r\nWhile these batteries were engaged in silencing the enemy's artillery,\r\nfor which purpose most of them were placed in prolongation of the faces\r\nof the fortress so as to enfilade them, the \"Approach Trenches\" were\r\nbeing pushed forward. The normal attack included a couple of bastions\r\nand the ravelin between, with such faces of the fortress as could\r\nsupport them; and the approach trenches (usually three sets) were\r\ndirected on the capitals of the bastions and ravelin, advancing in a\r\nzigzag so arranged that the prolongations of the trenches always fell\r\nclear of the fortress and could not be enfiladed.\r\n\r\nFig. 65, taken from Vauban's _Attack and Defence of Places_, shows\r\nclearly the arrangement of trenches and batteries.\r\n\r\n  After the approach trenches had been carried forward nearly half-way\r\n  to the most advanced points of the covered way, the \"second parallel\"\r\n  was constructed, and again the approach trenches were pushed forward.\r\n  Midway between the second parallel and the covered way, short branches\r\n  called _Demi-parallels_ were thrown out to either flank of the\r\n  attacks: and finally at the foot of the glacis came the third\r\n  parallel. Thus there was always a secure position for a sufficient\r\n  guard of the trenches. Upon an alarm the working parties could fall\r\n  back and the guard would advance.\r\n\r\n  Trenches were either made by _common trenchwork, flying trenchwork or\r\n  sap_. In the first two a considerable length of trench was excavated\r\n  at one time by a large working party extended along the trench: flying\r\n  trenchwork (formerly known as flying sap) being distinguished from\r\n  common trenchwork by the use of gabions, by the help of which\r\n  protection could be more quickly obtained. Both these kinds of\r\n  trenchwork were commenced at night, the position of the trench having\r\n  been previously marked out by tape. The \"tasks\" or quantities of earth\r\n  to be excavated by each man were so calculated that by daybreak the\r\n  trench would afford a fair amount of cover. Flying trenchwork was\r\n  generally used for the 2nd parallel and its approaches, and as far\r\n  beyond it as possible. In proportion as the attack drew nearer to the\r\n  covered way, the fire of the defenders' small-arms and wall-pieces\r\n  naturally grew more effective, though by this time most of their\r\n  artillery would have been dismounted by the fire of the siege\r\n  batteries. It therefore became necessary before reaching the 3rd\r\n  parallel to have recourse to sap.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Regular Attack (Vauban).]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sapping.\r\n\r\n  Sapping required trained men. It consisted in gradually pushing\r\n  forward the end of a narrow trench in the desired direction. At the\r\n  sap-head was a squad of sappers. The leading man excavated a trench 1\r\n  ft. 6 in. wide and deep. To protect the head of the trench he had a\r\n  shield on wheels, under cover of which he placed the gabions in\r\n  position one after another as the sap-head progressed. Other men\r\n  following strengthened the parapet with fascines, and increased the\r\n  trench to a depth of 3 ft., and a width of 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 ft. Fig.\r\n  66, taken from Vauban's treatise on the attack, shows the process\r\n  clearly. The sap after being completed to this extent could be widened\r\n  at leisure to ordinary trench dimensions by infantry working parties.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 66.--Sapping (Vauban).]\r\n\r\n  As the work at the sap-head was very dangerous, Vauban encouraged his\r\n  sappers by paying them on the spot at piecework rates, which increased\r\n  rapidly in proportion to the risk. He thus stimulated all concerned to\r\n  do their best, and reckoned that under average conditions he could\r\n  depend on a rate of progress for an ordinary sap of about 50 yds. in\r\n  24 hours.\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to compare the more recent method of sapping with\r\n  that above described (fig. 67 taken from the _Instruction in Military\r\n  Engineering_, 1896). It is no longer possible to place gabions in\r\n  position at the sap-head under fire. Accordingly the leading sapper\r\n  excavates to the full depth of 4 ft. 6 in., and the rate of progress\r\n  is retarded proportionately, so that an advance of only 15 to 30 yds.\r\n  in 24 hours can be reckoned on instead of 50. The head of the sap is\r\n  protected by a number of half-filled sandbags, which the leading\r\n  sapper throws forward as he goes on.\r\n\r\n  The nearer the approaches drew to the covered way, the more oblique\r\n  became the zig-zags, so that little forward progress was made in\r\n  proportion to the length of the trench. The approaches were then\r\n  carried straight to the front, by means of the \"double sap,\" which\r\n  consisted of two single saps worked together with a parapet on each\r\n  side (fig. 68). To protect these from being enfiladed from the front,\r\n  traverses had to be left at intervals, usually by turning the two saps\r\n  at right angles to right or left for a few feet, then forward, and so\r\n  on as shown in fig. 69, the distance apart of these traverses being of\r\n  course regulated by the height from which the enemy's fire commanded\r\n  the trench.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Later stages of the attack.\r\n\r\nThe later stages in the attack are illustrated in fig. 70. From the\r\nthird parallel the attack was pushed forward up the glacis by means of\r\nthe double sap. It was then pushed right and left along the glacis, a\r\nlittle distance from the crest of the covered way. This was called\r\n\"crowning\" the covered way, and on the position thus gained breaching\r\nbatteries were established in full view of the escarp. While the escarp\r\nwas being breached, if it was intended to use a systematic attack\r\nthroughout, a mine gallery (see _Mining_ below) was driven under the\r\ncovered way and an opening made through the counterscarp into the ditch.\r\nThe sap was then pushed across the ditch, and if necessary up the\r\nbreach, the defenders' resistance being kept under by musketry and\r\nartillery fire from the covered way. The ravelin and bastions were thus\r\ncaptured successively, and where the bastions had been retrenched the\r\nsame methods were used against the retrenchment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Military Engineering_, by permission of the\r\nController of H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\nFIG. 67.--\"Deep\" Sap.]\r\n\r\nVauban showed how to breach the escarp with the least expenditure of\r\nammunition. This was done by making, with successive shots placed close\r\ntogether (which was feasible even in those days from a position so close\r\nas the crest of the covered way) horizontal and vertical cuts through\r\nthe revetment wall. The portion of revetment enclosed by the cuts being\r\nthus detached from support was overturned by the pressure of the earth\r\nfrom the rampart. Ricochet fire was also the invention of Vauban. He\r\nshowed how, in enfilading the face of a work, by using greatly reduced\r\ncharges a shot could be made to drop over the crest of the parapet and\r\nskim along the terreplein, dismounting guns and killing men as it went.\r\n\r\n\r\n  18th-century principles of defence.\r\n\r\nThe constant success of Vauban must be ascribed to method and thorough\r\norganization. There was a deadly certainty about his system that gave\r\nrise to the saying \"Place assiegee, place prise.\" He left nothing to\r\nchance, and preferred as a rule the slow and certain progress of saps\r\nacross the ditch and up the breach to the loss and delay that might\r\nfollow an unsuccessful assault. His contemporary and nearest rival\r\nCoehoorn tried to shorten sieges by heavy artillery fire and attacks\r\nacross the open; but in the long run his sieges were slower than\r\nVauban's.\r\n\r\nSo much a matter of form did the attack become under these conditions,\r\nthat in comparing the supposed defensive powers of different systems of\r\nfortification it was usual to calculate the number of days that would be\r\nrequired in each case before the breach was opened, the time being\r\nmeasured by the number of hours of work required for the construction of\r\nthe various trenches and batteries. It began to be taken as a matter of\r\ncourse that no place under any circumstances could hold out more than a\r\ngiven number of days; and naturally, when the whole question had become\r\none of formula, it is not surprising to find that places were very often\r\nsurrendered without more than a perfunctory show of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe theory of defence at this time appeared to be that since it was\r\nimpossible to arrest the now methodical and protected progress of the\r\nbesiegers' trenches, no real resistance was possible until after they\r\nhad reached the covered way, and this idea is at the root of the\r\nextraordinary complications of outworks and multiplied lines of ramparts\r\nthat characterized the \"systems\" of this period. No doubt if a successor\r\nto Vauban could have brought the same genius to bear on the actual\r\ndefence of places as he did on the attack, he would have discovered that\r\nthe essence of successful defence lay in offensive action outside the\r\nbody of the place, viz. with trench against trench. For want of such a\r\nman the engineers of the defence resigned themselves contentedly to the\r\nloss of the open ground outside their walls, and relied either upon\r\nsuccessive permanent lines of defence, or if these did not exist, upon\r\nextemporized retrenchments, usually at the gorge of the bastion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Double Sap.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious that such experienced soldiers as most of them were should\r\nnot have realized the fatal effect upon the minds of the defenders which\r\nthis almost passive abandonment of line after line must needs produce.\r\nEven a civilian--Machiavelli--had seen into the truth of the matter\r\nyears before when he said (_Treatise on the Art of War_, Book vii.):\r\n\"And here I ought to give an advice ... to those who are constructing a\r\nfortress, and that is, not to establish within its circuit\r\nfortifications which may serve as a retreat to troops who have been\r\ndriven back from the first line.... I maintain that there is no greater\r\ndanger for a fortress than rear fortifications whither troops can retire\r\nin case of a reverse; for once the soldier knows that he has a secure\r\nretreat after he has abandoned the first post, he does in fact abandon\r\nit and so causes the loss of the entire fortress.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Direct advance by Double Sap.]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that in those days when soldiers were\r\nmostly of a separate or professional caste, the whole thing had become a\r\nmatter of business. Fighting was so much regulated by the laws and\r\ncustoms of war that men thought nothing of giving up a place if,\r\naccording to accepted opinion, the enemy had advanced so far that they\r\ncould no longer hope to defend it successfully. Once this idea had set\r\nin it became hopeless to expect successful defences, save now and then\r\nwhen some officer of very unusual resolution was in command. This is the\r\nreal reason for the feeble resistance so often made by fortresses in the\r\n17th and 18th centuries, which has been attributed to inherent weakness\r\nin fortifications. Custom exacted that a commandant should not give up a\r\nplace until there was an open breach or, perhaps, until he had stood at\r\nleast one assault. Even Napoleon recognized this limitation of the\r\npowers of the defence when in the later years of his reign he was trying\r\nto impress upon his governors the importance of their charge. The\r\nlimitation was perfectly unnecessary, for history at that time could\r\nhave afforded plenty of instances of places that had been successfully\r\ndefended for many months after breaches were opened, and assault after\r\nassault repulsed on the same breach. But the same soldiers of the 17th\r\nand 18th centuries who had created this artificial condition of affairs,\r\nestablished it by making it an understood thing that a garrison which\r\nsurrendered without giving too much trouble after a breach had been\r\nopened should have honourable consideration; while if they put the\r\nbesiegers to the pains of storming the breach, they were liable to be\r\nput to the sword.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Later Stages of the Attack (Vauban).]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Peninsular War.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to dwell at some length on the siegecraft of\r\nVauban and his time, not merely for its historical interest, but because\r\nthe system he introduced was practically unaltered until the end of the\r\n19th century. The sieges of the Peninsular War were conducted on his\r\nlines; so was that of Antwerp in 1830; and as far as the disposition of\r\nsiege trenches was concerned, the same system remained in the Crimea,\r\nthe Franco-German War and the Russo-Turkish War. The sieges in the\r\nNapoleonic wars were few, except in the Iberian peninsula. These last\r\ndiffered from those of the Vauban period and the 18th century in this,\r\nthat instead of being deliberately undertaken with ample means, against\r\nfortresses that answered to the requirements of the time, they were\r\nattempted with inadequate forces and materials, against out-of-date\r\nworks. The fortresses that Wellington besieged in Spain had rudimentary\r\noutworks, and escarps that could be seen and breached from a distance.\r\nAt that time, though the power of small arms had increased very slightly\r\nsince the last century, there had been a distinct improvement in\r\nartillery, so that it was possible to breach a visible revetment at\r\nranges from 500 to 1000 yds. Wellington was very badly off for\r\nengineers, siege artillery and material. Trench works could only be\r\ncarried out on a small scale and slowly. Time being usually of great\r\nimportance, as in the first two sieges of Badajoz, his technical\r\nadvisers endeavoured to shorten sieges by breaching the escarp from a\r\ndistance--a new departure--and launching assaults from trenches that had\r\nnot reached the covered way. Under these circumstances the direct\r\nattacks on breaches failed several times, with great loss of life.\r\nWellington in one or two earlier despatches reflected on his engineers\r\nfor not establishing their batteries on the crest of the glacis. The\r\nfailures are, however, clearly due to attempts to push sieges to a\r\nconclusion without proper preparation.\r\n\r\n  So much has been written of late years in criticism of the\r\n  fortification to what may be called the Vauban period that it is\r\n  important to note what were the preparations considered necessary for\r\n  a siege at that time (_Journals of Sieges in Spain, 1811 to 1814_).\r\n  Sir John Jones summarizes his own experience in Spain and the data\r\n  accumulated by practical engineers in former sieges from the time of\r\n  Vauban onwards, in the following conclusions: The actual work of\r\n  entrenching, sapping, &c., on the front attacked was much the same\r\n  whether the fortress contained 5000 or 10,000 men. On the other hand\r\n  the guard of the trenches was proportionate to the fighting men inside\r\n  the fortress. (The total number of men had of course to be sufficient\r\n  to allow three or four complete shifts or \"reliefs\" for all work and\r\n  duties.) Adding a proportion of men for camp and other duties, he\r\n  calculates, for the vigorous siege of an ordinary place situated in\r\n  open country and containing 5000 men, a corps of 32,080 effectives,\r\n  and remarks further that this force would be greatly exhausted after a\r\n  month's service. The same place held by 10,000 would call for a\r\n  besieging army of 50,830 men (guards and duties increasing, but not\r\n  working parties). Thus the besieger should if possible have a\r\n  superiority of 7 to 1 if the garrison numbered 5000, 6 to 1 if 10,000\r\n  and 5 to 1 if 15,000 and so on. As regards artillery, he should have\r\n  as many, and if possible twice as many, guns as those of the defender\r\n  on the front of attack, as well as howitzers for sweeping every line\r\n  subject to enfilade and mortars for destroying traverses, &c. Later in\r\n  the siege, more howitzers and mortars to clear the covered way and\r\n  places of arms, and finally, after the covering of the covered way,\r\n  fifty additional battering guns would be required. It is apparent from\r\n  this that the practical engineers of the day looked upon a siege as a\r\n  serious matter, and did not find permanent fortifications wanting in\r\n  defensive strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Crimea.\r\n\r\nDuring the long peace that followed the Napoleonic wars, one advance was\r\nmade in siegecraft. In England in 1824 successful experiments were\r\ncarried out in breaching an unseen wall by curved or indirect fire from\r\nhowitzers. At Antwerp in 1830 the increasing power and range of\r\nartillery, and especially of howitzers, were used for bombarding\r\npurposes, the breaches there being mostly made by mines. Then came one\r\nof the world's great sieges; that of Sevastopol in 1854-1855 (see\r\nCRIMEAN WAR). The outstanding lesson of Sevastopol is the value of an\r\nactive defence; of going out to meet the besieger, with countertrench\r\nand countermine. This lesson has increased in value for us in proportion\r\nto the increased power of the rifle.\r\n\r\n  In comparing the resistance made behind the earthworks of Sevastopol\r\n  with the recorded defences of permanent works, it is essential to\r\n  remember that the conditions there were quite abnormal. Sir John Jones\r\n  has told us what the relative forces of besiegers and besieged should\r\n  be, and the necessary preponderance of artillery for the attack. The\r\n  following quotations may be added:\r\n\r\n  \"The siege corps should be sufficiently strong--(1) To invest the\r\n  fortress completely, and maintain the investment against all the\r\n  efforts of the garrison. (2) If a regular siege is contemplated, to\r\n  execute and guard all the siege works required for it. Complete\r\n  investment may sometimes be impossible, but experience has repeatedly\r\n  shown that the difficulties of a siege are enormously increased if the\r\n  garrison are able to draw fresh troops and supplies from outside, and\r\n  to rid themselves of their sick and wounded.\" (Lewis). Again as\r\n  regards artillery: \"In a regular attack, where every point is gained\r\n  inch by inch, it is impossible to succeed without overpowering the\r\n  defensive artillery\"; and \"it is useless to attempt to sap near a\r\n  place till its artillery fire is subdued...\" (Jones).\r\n\r\n  These conditions were so far from being fulfilled at Sevastopol that\r\n  (a) there was no investment--in fact the Russians came nearer to\r\n  investing the Allies; (b) the Russians had the preponderance in guns\r\n  almost throughout; (c) the Russian force in and about Sevastopol was\r\n  numerically superior to that of the Allies. We must add to this that\r\n  Todleben had been able to get rid of most of his civilian population,\r\n  and those who remained were chiefly dockyard workmen, able to give\r\n  most valuable assistance on the defence works. The circumstances were\r\n  therefore exceptionally favourable to an active defence. The weak\r\n  point about the extemporized earthworks, which eventually led to the\r\n  fall of the place, was the want of good bomb-proof cover near the\r\n  parapets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Franco-German War.\r\n\r\nThe Franco-German War of 1870 produced no great novelty. The Germans\r\nwere not anxious to undertake siege operations when it could be avoided.\r\nIn several cases minor fortresses surrendered after a slight\r\nbombardment. In others, after the bombardment failed, the Germans\r\ncontented themselves with establishing a blockade or detaching a small\r\nobserving force. By far the most interesting siege was that of Belfort\r\n(q.v.). Here Colonel Denfert-Rochereau employed the active defence so\r\nsuccessfully by extemporizing detached redoubts and fortifying outlying\r\nvillages, that he obliged the besiegers (who, however, were a small\r\nforce at first) to take up an investing line 25 m. long; and succeeded\r\nin holding the village of Danjoutin, 2000 yds. in advance of the\r\nenceinte, for two months after the siege began. He also used indirect\r\nfire, withdrawing guns from the ramparts and placing them in the\r\nditches, in the open spaces of the town, &c. At Paris the French found\r\ngreat advantage in placing batteries in inconspicuous positions outside\r\nthe forts. Their direct fire guns were at a disadvantage in being fired\r\nthrough embrasures. These had served their purpose when artillery fire\r\nwas very inaccurate, but had now for a long time been recognized by the\r\nbest engineers as out of date. The Germans since the siege of Duppel in\r\n1864 had mounted their siege guns on \"overbank\" carriages; that is, high\r\ncarriages which made it possible to fire the guns over the parapet of\r\nthe battery without embrasures. The guns in the Paris forts which were\r\nfurther handicapped by conspicuous parapets and the bad shooting of the\r\ngunners were easily silenced.\r\n\r\nAt Strassburg indirect fire against escarps was used. The escarp of\r\nLunette 53 was successfully breached by this method. The breaching\r\nbattery was 870 yds. distant, and the shot struck the face of the wall\r\nat an angle (horizontally) of 55 deg., the effect being observed and\r\nreported from the counterscarp. 1000 rounds from 60-pounder guns\r\nsufficed to make a breach 30 yds. wide.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 71 is a good example of the attack in the late stages. It will be\r\n  observed that batteries for mortars and field guns are established in\r\n  the captured lunettes. The narrow wet ditch of Lunette 53 was crossed\r\n  by a dam of earth and fascines, the headway protected by a parapet or\r\n  screen of sandbags.\r\n\r\n  \"Lunette 52 was unrevetted, and its ditch was more than 60 yds. wide,\r\n  and 6 to 9 ft. deep.... It was determined to effect the passage by a\r\n  cask bridge, for which the casks were furnished by breweries near at\r\n  hand.... The formation of the bridge was begun at nightfall. A pioneer\r\n  swam across, hauled over a cable, and made it fast to the hedge on the\r\n  berm. Four men were stationed in the water, close to the covered way,\r\n  the casks were rolled down to them one after the other, and fitted\r\n  with saddles, so as to form piers ... these piers were successively\r\n  boomed out along the line of the cable.... In two hours the bridge was\r\n  finished, and the lunette was entered.... The work had not been\r\n  discovered by the besieged, and the formation of lodgments inside the\r\n  lunette was already begun, when the noise made by some troops in\r\n  passing the bridge attracted attention, and drew a fire which cost the\r\n  besiegers about 50 men. A dam was afterwards substituted for the\r\n  bridge, as it was repeatedly struck by shells.\" (_R.E. Professional\r\n  Papers_, vol. xix.)\r\n\r\n  It is curious to realize that this happened at so recent a time. Such\r\n  operations would be impossible now, as long as any defending guns\r\n  remained in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern siege warfare.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it may be said that siegecraft gained practically nothing\r\nfrom the Franco-German War. The Russo-Turkish war taught less, Plevna\r\n(q.v.) having been defended by field works and attacked by the\r\nold-fashioned methods. For the last ten years of the 19th century\r\nmilitary opinion was quite at a loss as to how the sieges of the future\r\nwould work out. As guns and projectiles continued to improve the\r\n\"attaque brusquee\" proposed by von Sauer had many adherents. It was\r\nthought that a heavy bombardment would paralyse resistance and open the\r\nway for an attack, to be delivered by great numbers and with special\r\nappliances for crossing obstacles. Others thought that the strength of\r\nthe defence, as manifested by the Plevna field works, would be greater\r\nthan ever when the field works were backed by permanent works, good\r\ncommunications and the resources of a fortress. One thing was\r\nobvious--namely, that as long as the artillery of the place, of even the\r\nsmallest calibres, remained unsubdued, the difficulty of trenchwork and\r\nsapping would be enormously increased, and no one seemed to have formed\r\na clear conception of how that difficulty was to be met. A lecture\r\ndelivered in Germany about 1895 is worth quoting as a fair example of\r\nthe vagueness of idea then prevailing: \"For the attack, the following is\r\nthe actual procedure: Accumulation and preparation of material for\r\nattack before the fortress: advance of attacking artillery, covered by\r\ninfantry. Artillery duel. Throwing forward of infantry: destruction of\r\nthe capability for defence of the position attacked; when possible by\r\nlong-range artillery fire, otherwise by the aid of the engineers.\r\nOccupation of the defensive position. Assault on the inner lines of the\r\nfortress.\" That seemed quite a simple prescription, but the necessary\r\ndrugs were wanting. And even since Port Arthur great uncertainty as to\r\nthe future of the attack remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Textbook of Fortification_, by permission of the\r\nController H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\nFIG. 71.--Strassburg, Lunettes 52 and 53, 1870.]\r\n\r\n  Modern artillery has much simplified the construction of siege\r\n  batteries. Formerly siege batteries and rampart batteries opposed each\r\n  other with direct fire at ranges not too long for the unaided human\r\n  eye, and the shells, travelling with low velocity, bit into the\r\n  parapets, and, exploding, produced their full effect. Accordingly the\r\n  task of the gunners was, by accurate fire, to destroy the parapets and\r\n  embrasures, and to dismount the guns. The parapets of siege batteries\r\n  were therefore made from 18 to 30 ft. thick, and the construction of\r\n  such batteries, with traverses, &c., involved much work. The height of\r\n  parapet necessary for proper protection being 7 ft. 6 in. to 8 ft., a\r\n  great deal of labour could be saved by sinking the gun-platforms about\r\n  4 ft. below the surface level, but of course this was only possible\r\n  where rock or water were not near the surface.\r\n\r\n  The effect of modern projectiles was to reduce the thickness of earth\r\n  necessary for parapets. High velocity projectiles are very easily\r\n  deflected upwards by even a slight bank of earth. This is especially\r\n  the case with sand. Loose earth is better than compacted earth, and\r\n  clay offers the least resistance to penetration. These facts were\r\n  taken note of in England more than on the Continent in the design of\r\n  instructional siege batteries.\r\n\r\n  The construction of batteries is moreover vastly simplified by the\r\n  long ranges at which artillery will fight in future. It will as a rule\r\n  be possible to place howitzer batteries in such positions that even\r\n  from balloons it will be difficult to locate them; and even direct\r\n  fire batteries can easily be screened from view. This renders parapets\r\n  unnecessary, and probably no more protection will be used than light\r\n  splinter-proof screens to stop shrapnel bullets or fragments of common\r\n  shell. Moreover batteries can be constructed at leisure and by\r\n  daylight.\r\n\r\n  The most important point about the modern battery is the gun platform\r\n  for the larger natures of guns and howitzers. These require very solid\r\n  construction to resist the heavy shock of discharge. Not long ago it\r\n  was thought that the defence would have larger ordnance than the\r\n  attack, as anything heavier than an 8 in. howitzer required a concrete\r\n  bed, which could not be made at short notice. The Japanese, however,\r\n  at Port Arthur made concrete platforms for 11 in. howitzers. It may be\r\n  remarked that difficulties which loom largely in peace are often\r\n  overcome easily enough under the stress of war.\r\n\r\n  Another gain to the attack is in connexion with magazines. The old\r\n  powder magazines were particularly dangerous adjuncts to batteries,\r\n  and had to be very carefully bomb-proofed. Such propellants as\r\n  cordite, however, are comparatively harmless in the open. They are\r\n  very difficult to detonate, and if set on fire do not explode like\r\n  gunpowder. It is therefore unnecessary to provide bomb-proof magazines\r\n  for them in connexion with the batteries.\r\n\r\n  In future sieges the question of supply will be more important than it\r\n  has ever been. Leaving out of the question the bringing up of supplies\r\n  from the base of operations, the task of distribution at the front is\r\n  a very large one. The Paris siege manoeuvres of 1894 furnish some\r\n  instructive data on this point. The main siege park was at Meaux, 10\r\n  m. from the 1st artillery position, and the average distance from the\r\n  1st artillery position to the principal fort attacked was 5000 yds.\r\n  The front of attack on Fort Vaujours and its collateral batteries\r\n  covered 10,000 yds. There were 24 batteries in the 1st artillery\r\n  position; say 100 guns, spread over a front of 4000 yds. To connect\r\n  Meaux with the front, the French laid some 30 m. of narrow gauge\r\n  railway largely along existing roads. The line was single, with\r\n  numerous branches and sidings. They ran 11 regular trains to the front\r\n  daily and half-a-dozen supplementary. The amount of artillery material\r\n  sent up was over 5000 tons, without any projectiles; but it can easily\r\n  be imagined that large demands were also made on transport for other\r\n  purposes. For instance, one complete bakery train was sent up daily.\r\n  The amount of ammunition sent up would be limited only by the power of\r\n  transporting it. A siege train of 100 pieces could probably dispose of\r\n  from 500 to 1000 tons of ammunition a day, at the maximum rate of\r\n  firing.\r\n\r\n  But the most important question affecting the sieges of the future\r\n  (putting aside accidental circumstances) will be the configuration of\r\n  the ground. Assuming that local conditions do not specially favour the\r\n  artillery of either side, it is highly probable that the artillery\r\n  duel will result in a deadlock. If the besiegers' guns do not succeed\r\n  in silencing those of the defence from the 1st or distant artillery\r\n  position (which, whether they are in cupolas or in concealed\r\n  positions, will in any case be an extremely difficult task), it will\r\n  be necessary for the infantry to press in; to feel for weak points,\r\n  and to fight for those that offer better positions for fire and\r\n  observation. In doing this they will have to face the defenders'\r\n  infantry, entrenched, backed by their unsilenced guns, and having\r\n  secure places of assembly from which to deliver counter-attacks. The\r\n  distance to which they can work forward and establish themselves under\r\n  these conditions will depend on the ground. It will then be for the\r\n  engineers to cross the remaining space by sap. This, under present\r\n  conditions, will be a tedious process, and may even take long enough\r\n  to cause the failure of the siege.\r\n\r\n  As to the manner of the sap, it will certainly be \"deep,\" as long as\r\n  the defence retains any artillery power. When the 4 ft. 6 in. sap\r\n  already described was first introduced, it was known as a \"deep sap\";\r\n  but the sieges of the future will probably necessitate a true deep\r\n  sap, that is one in which the whole of the necessary cover is got\r\n  below the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n  Such a sap may consist of an open trench, about 6 ft. deep, the whole\r\n  of the excavated earth being carried away through the trench to the\r\n  rear; or a blinded trench, covered in as it progresses by\r\n  splinter-proof timbers and earth; or a tunnelled trench, leaving a\r\n  foot or so of surface earth undisturbed. In either case nothing should\r\n  be visible from the front to attract artillery fire. As the sap is\r\n  completed, it will sometimes be necessary to add a slight parapet in\r\n  places, to give command over the foreground for the rifles of the\r\n  guard of the trenches.\r\n\r\n  The sap will have to be pushed up quite close to the defenders'\r\n  trenches and obstacles. After that further progress must either be\r\n  made by mining, or as seems very probable, by getting the better of\r\n  the defenders in a contest with shells from short-range mortars.\r\n\r\n  Just as in the feudal ages a castle was built on some solitary\r\n  eminence which lent itself to the defensive methods of the time, so in\r\n  the future the detached forts and supporting points in the girdle of\r\n  a fortress will be sited where smooth and gentle slopes of ground give\r\n  the utmost opportunity to the defenders' fire, and the least chance of\r\n  concealment to the enemy. There will be considerable latitude of\r\n  choice in the defensive positions; though not, of course, the same\r\n  latitude as when the existence of a precipitous hill was the _raison\r\n  d'etre_ of the castle. In some places, as at Port Arthur, the whole\r\n  country-side may by reason of its steep and broken slopes be\r\n  unfavourable to the defence, though even then genius will turn the\r\n  difficulties to account. But wherever it is possible the defender will\r\n  provide for a space of 1000 yds. or so, swept by fire and illuminated\r\n  by searchlights, in front of his lines. That space will have to be\r\n  crossed by sap, and it needs little imagination to realize how great\r\n  the task will be for the besieger.\r\n\r\n  There are other modern methods of siege warfare to be noticed, the use\r\n  of which is common to besiegers and besieged. Much is expected of\r\n  balloons; but the use of these in war is unlikely to correspond to\r\n  peace expectations. They must be kept at a considerable distance from\r\n  the enemy's guns, a distance which will increase as the means of\r\n  range-finding improve; and as the height from which they can observe\r\n  usefully is limited, so is the observers' power to search out hidden\r\n  objects behind vertical screens. Thus, suppose a captive balloon at a\r\n  height of 2000 ft., and distant 4000 yds. from an enemy's howitzer\r\n  battery: and suppose the battery placed behind a steep hill-side or a\r\n  grove of trees, at such a distance that a shell fired with 30 deg.\r\n  elevation can just clear this screen. The line of sight from the\r\n  observer to the battery is inclined to the horizontal at {2000/3 x\r\n  4000}, that is 1/6, or roughly 10 deg. It is obvious, therefore, that\r\n  the observer cannot see the battery.\r\n\r\n  Balloon observers are expected to assist the batteries by marking the\r\n  effects of their fire. For this to be done on any practical scale a\r\n  balloon would be required for each battery: that is, for only 100\r\n  guns, some 20 or 25 balloons. These would require an equal number of\r\n  highly skilled observers (of whom there are not too many in\r\n  existence), besides the other balloon personnel and accessories, and\r\n  the means of making gas, which is too much to expect, even if an enemy\r\n  were obliging enough to give notice of his intentions.\r\n\r\n  Telephones and all other means of transmitting intelligence rapidly\r\n  are now of the utmost importance to both attack and defence. Maps\r\n  marked with numbered squares are necessary for directing artillery\r\n  fire, especially from cupolas. Organization in every branch will give\r\n  better results than ever before, and the question of communication and\r\n  transport from the base of supplies right up to the front needs\r\n  detailed study, in view of the great weight of ammunition and supplies\r\n  that will have to be handled.\r\n\r\n  The use of light mortars for the trenches, introduced by Coehoorn and\r\n  revived with extemporized means at Port Arthur, needs great attention.\r\n  It may be prophesied that the issue of important sieges in the future,\r\n  when skilfully conducted on both sides with sufficient resources, will\r\n  depend mainly on the energy of the defenders in trench work, on mining\r\n  and countermining in connexion with the trenches, and on the use of\r\n  light mortars made to throw large charges of high explosive for short\r\n  distances with great accuracy.\r\n\r\n  For a brief narrative of the siege of Port Arthur in 1904, one of the\r\n  greatest sieges of history, both as regards its epic interest and its\r\n  military importance, the reader is referred to the article\r\n  RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR.\r\n\r\n  DEFINITIONS.--The following definitions may be useful, but have no\r\n  place in the evolution of the attack, to which this section is mainly\r\n  devoted.\r\n\r\n  _Investment._--This most necessary, almost indispensable operation of\r\n  every siege consists in surrounding the fortress about to be besieged,\r\n  so as to cut off its communications with the outside world.\r\n  _Preliminary investment_ which is carried out by cavalry and light\r\n  troops before the arrival of the besieging force, consists in closing\r\n  the roads so as to shut out supplies and reinforcements. _Close\r\n  investment_ should be of such a character as to prevent any sort of\r\n  communication, even by single messengers or spies. The term\r\n  \"_blockade_\" is sometimes loosely used instead of investment.\r\n\r\n  _Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation._--These now obsolete\r\n  terms were in great use until the 19th century. The _circumvallation_\r\n  was a line of parapet which the besieger made outside the investing\r\n  position of his own force, to protect it when there was a chance of\r\n  attack by a relieving army. The line of _contravallation_ was the line\r\n  of parapet and trench sometimes made by the besieger all round the\r\n  town he was attacking, to check the sorties of the garrison.\r\n\r\n  _Observing Force._--When circumstances make the reduction of a\r\n  particular fortress in the theatre of operations unnecessary a force\r\n  is often detached to \"observe\" it. The duty of this force will be to\r\n  watch the garrison and prevent any hostile action such as raids on the\r\n  lines of communications.\r\n\r\n  _Bombardment._--This operation, common to all ages, consists in a\r\n  general (sometimes an indiscriminate) fire against either the whole\r\n  target offered by the fortress or a particular section of that target.\r\n  In ancient and medieval times the effect of a bombardment--whether of\r\n  ordinary missiles, of incendiary projectiles, or of poisonous matters\r\n  tending to breed pestilence--upon a population closely crowded within\r\n  its walls was very powerful. In the present day little military\r\n  importance is attached to bombardment, since under modern conditions\r\n  it cannot do much real harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. MILITARY MINING\r\n\r\nIt has been noted already that mining is one of the most ancient\r\nresources of siege warfare. The use of gunpowder in mining operations\r\ndates from the end of the 15th century. When Shakespeare makes Fluellen\r\nsay, at Henry V.'s siege of Harfleur, \"th'athversary is digt himself\r\nfour yards under the countermines; I think 'a will plow up all, if there\r\nis not better directions,\" he is anticipating the development of\r\nsiegecraft by nearly 100 years. Pedro di Navarro, a Spanish officer, is\r\ncredited with the first practical use of explosive mines. He employed\r\nthem with great success at the siege of Naples in 1503; and afterwards,\r\nwhen rebuilding the Castello Nuovo after the siege, was probably the\r\nfirst to make permanent provision for their use in countermines.\r\nCountermining had been a measure of defence against the earlier methods\r\nof attack-mining; the object being to break into the besiegers'\r\ngalleries and fight hand to hand for the possession of them. When the\r\nexplosive mine was introduced, it became the object of the defenders to\r\nestablish their countermines near the besiegers' galleries and destroy\r\nthem by the effect of the explosion. In the 400 years or so that have\r\npassed this branch of warfare has changed less than any other. Methods\r\nof mining have not advanced much, and the increased power of high\r\nexplosives as compared with gunpowder has its least advantage in moving\r\nmasses of earth.\r\n\r\nWhen a besieger has arrived by means of trenches within a certain\r\ndistance of the enemy's works without having subdued their fire, he may\r\nfind that the advance by sap becomes too slow and too dangerous. He can\r\nthen advance underground by means of mine galleries, and by exploding\r\nlarge charges at the heads of these galleries can make a series of\r\ncraters. These craters are then occupied by infantry, and are connected\r\nwith each other and with the parallel in rear by trenches, thus forming\r\na new parallel. If not interfered with by the defenders the besieger can\r\nadvance in this way until he reaches the counterscarp. His mines will\r\nnow be turned to a new purpose, viz. to breach the counterscarp and\r\nafterwards the escarp. This is done by placing suitable charges at\r\nintervals behind the scarps at such a height above the foundations that\r\nthe pressure of the earth above the mine will more than counterbalance\r\nthe resistance of the masonry.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mines and countermines.\r\n\r\nBut if the defenders are active, they will countermine. There is as a\r\ngeneral rule this broad difference between the mines of the defence and\r\nthose of the attack, that the defenders do not wish the surface of the\r\nground broken, lest increased opportunities of getting cover should be\r\noffered to the besiegers. The object of the defence, therefore, is to\r\ndestroy the besiegers' galleries without forming craters, and for this\r\npurpose they generally endeavour to get underneath the attack galleries.\r\nThe defenders may, however, wish, if the opportunity is allowed them, to\r\nexplode mines under the attack parallels, in which case there is of\r\ncourse no objection to disturbing the surface.\r\n\r\n  \"At the commencement of the subterranean war the main object of the\r\n  defence is to force the besieger to take to mining operations as early\r\n  as possible, as it is a tedious operation and will prolong the siege.\r\n  Every endeavour must be made to push forward countermines so as to\r\n  meet and check the attack. On the approach of the opponents to each\r\n  other careful listening for the enemy must be resorted to. To this end\r\n  it is necessary at _irregular_ intervals to suspend all work for some\r\n  minutes at a time, closing doors of communication and employing\r\n  experienced listeners at the heads of the countermines. This matter is\r\n  a most important one, as a premature explosion of the defender's mines\r\n  is a double loss to the defender, a loss of a mine and an advantage to\r\n  the enemy in more than one way. As soon as the overcharged mines of\r\n  the besieger have been fired, a heavy fire should be brought to bear\r\n  on the craters, and if possible sorties should be made to prevent the\r\n  enemy occupying them. At the same time every effort should be made\r\n  underground to surround with galleries, and as it were isolate, the\r\n  craters so as to prevent the besieger making a new advance from them.\r\n  The efforts of the attack at this stage will probably be directed to\r\n  the formation of what are called \"Boule shafts\" (i.e. shafts partially\r\n  lined in which charges are hastily fired with little or no tamping),\r\n  and to meet these in time the defender may resort to the use of boring\r\n  tools, and so place charges somewhere in advance of the heads of the\r\n  countermines. His great object must be to prevent as long as possible\r\n  the besieger from getting underground again; and these occasions, when\r\n  the power of resistance is temporarily equal to, if not greater than,\r\n  that of the attack, should be made the most of by the defence.\"\r\n  (Lewis, _Text-book on Fortification, &c._, 1893.)\r\n\r\nThe defence has the advantage, in the case of fortresses, of being able\r\nto establish beforehand a system of countermine galleries in masonry.\r\nMany systems have been worked out for this purpose. A good typical\r\narrangement is that of General Marescot, published in 1799, shown in\r\nfig. 72.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Textbook of Fortification_, by permission of the\r\nController H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\nFIG. 72.]\r\n\r\nThe main galleries (those running out in a straight line from the\r\ncounterscarp gallery _e_ to three of the points _a_) fall gently to the\r\nfront to a depth of 30 or 40 ft. below the surface--the deeper they are\r\nthe less they will suffer from the enemy's mines. Branch galleries\r\n(marked _c b + d c_) run obliquely upward from them to right and to\r\nleft, leading to the mines, which are placed at various depths,\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nTwo main points must be observed in any system of countermines: the\r\nbranch galleries must run obliquely forward, so as not to present their\r\nsides to the action of the enemy's mines; and the distance between the\r\nends of the branches from adjacent main galleries should be such that\r\nthe enemy cannot pass between them unheard. This distance will vary with\r\nthe nature of the soil, but may be taken roughly as 20 yds. A convenient\r\nsize for main galleries is 6 ft. high by 3 ft. wide: branch galleries\r\nmay be 5 ft. by 3 ft. When the enemy is approaching, other branch\r\ngalleries, called _listeners_, will be pushed out from main and branch\r\ngalleries. The section to fig. 1 of fig. 72 shows openings left for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAnother use of mines in defence is in connexion with breaches. A\r\npermanent arrangement for this purpose, by General Dufour, is shown in\r\nfig. 72. Yet another use, on which much ingenuity was expended in the\r\n18th century, is to extemporize retrenchments.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Different kinds of mines.\r\n\r\nThe charges of mines depend of course upon the effect which is desired.\r\nWhen the charge is strong enough to produce a crater, the radius of the\r\ncircular opening on the surface of the ground is called the _radius of\r\nthe crater_. The line drawn from the centre of the charge to the nearest\r\nsurface, which is expressed in feet, is called the _line of least\r\nresistance_ (L.L.R.). When a mine produces a crater the diameter of\r\nwhich is equal to the line of least resistance, it is called a one-lined\r\ncrater; when the diameter is double the L.L.R., a _two-lined crater_ and\r\nso on. _Common mines_ are those which produce a two-lined crater.\r\n_Over-charged mines_ produce craters greater than two-lined, and\r\n_undercharged mines_ less. A _camouflet_ does not produce a crater; it\r\nis used when the object is to destroy an enemy's gallery without\r\nbreaking the surface. Fig. 73 shows sections of the different kinds of\r\nmines, with their craters and the effect they will produce downwards and\r\nhorizontally in ordinary earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Action of a Common Mine\r\n\r\nProbable spheroids of rupture for overcharged Mines\r\n\r\nFrom _Instructions in Military Engineering_, by permission of the\r\nController of H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\nFIG. 73.--Mines.]\r\n\r\nConsideration of this figure will show that it is possible to place a\r\nlong charge at such a depth below the surface that it will destroy all\r\ngalleries of the enemy within a considerable radius, without much\r\ndisturbing the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n  Bored mines, which have been alluded to above, are a comparatively\r\n  recent innovation. When the enemy is heard at work in one of his\r\n  galleries and his position approximately determined by the sound, it\r\n  is necessary to drive a branch gallery with all speed in that\r\n  direction, and when it has advanced as far as appears necessary, to\r\n  load, tamp and discharge a mine before the enemy can fire his own\r\n  mine. This is one of the most delicate and dangerous operations of\r\n  war, and success will fall to those who are at the same time most\r\n  skilful and most determined. The work can be hastened and made less\r\n  dangerous as follows: Instead of driving a branch gallery, a hole\r\n  several inches in diameter is bored in the required direction. With\r\n  suitable tools there is no difficulty in driving a straight bore hole\r\n  20 or 30 ft. long. A small charge of high explosives is then pushed up\r\n  to the end of the borehole and fired. This forms a small camouflet\r\n  chamber by compressing the earth around it. Into this chamber the\r\n  charge for the mine is passed up the bore-hole. No tamping of course\r\n  is required.\r\n\r\nMine warfare is slow, dangerous and uncertain in its results. It will\r\ncertainly delay the besiegers' advance very much and may do so\r\nindefinitely. One point is distinctly in favour of the defence, namely\r\nthat when ground has been much mined it becomes charged with poisonous\r\ngases. Some explosives are less noxious than others in this way, and it\r\nwill be advantageous for the attack, but not necessarily for the\r\ndefence, to make use of these.\r\n\r\n  _Calculation of Charges._--The quantity of powder required for a\r\n  charge is expressed in lbs. in terms of L.L.R.^3, and the following\r\n  formulae are used:\r\n\r\n  l = L.L.R. in feet, r = radius of crater in feet, c = powder charge in\r\n  pounds, s = a variable dependent on the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\n                        s\r\n  For a common mine c = -- l^3\r\n                        10\r\n                              s\r\n  For an overcharged mine c = -- {l + .9(r - l)}^3.\r\n                              10\r\n\r\n                               s\r\n  For an undercharged mine c = -- {l - .9(l - r)}^3.\r\n                               10\r\n\r\n  The values to be given to s are:\r\n\r\n       Nature of Soil.            Value of s.\r\n    Very light earth                 0.80\r\n    Common earth                     1.00\r\n    Hard sand                        1.25\r\n    Earth mixed with stones          1.40\r\n    Clay mixed with loam             1.55\r\n    Inferior brickwork               1.66\r\n    Rock or good new brickwork       2.25\r\n    Very good old brickwork          2.50\r\n\r\nMilitary mining is carried on by means of vertical _shafts_ and\r\nhorizontal or inclined _galleries_. When the soil is very stiff, very\r\nlittle or even no lining is required for shafts and galleries; but\r\nusually they have to be lined either with cases or frames.\r\n\r\n  Cases make a complete lining of 2 in. planking. Frames are used at\r\n  intervals of 4 or 5 ft. to support a partial lining of planks. Cases\r\n  are of course preferable in other respects; but in ordinary soil they\r\n  take up more timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shafts and galleries.\r\n\r\n  There are two kinds of gallery in ordinary use in the British service,\r\n  namely the _common gallery_ whose interior dimensions with cases are 5\r\n  ft. 6 in. X 2 ft., and the _branch gallery_ which is 4 ft. X 2 ft. The\r\n  _shaft_ has about the same dimensions as a branch gallery. Formerly it\r\n  was sometimes necessary in the systematic attack of a fortress to get\r\n  guns down into the ditch. For this purpose a \"great gallery\" was used,\r\n  6 ft. 6 in. in height and 6 ft. 8 in. wide, internal dimensions.\r\n\r\n  _Miners' Tools._--These are few and simple. The pick and shovel differ\r\n  from the ordinary types in having rather shorter helves suitable for\r\n  the confined space in which they are used. There is also a\r\n  _push-pick_, an implement with a straight helve and a pointed shovel\r\n  head 6 in. long and 3-1/2 in. wide. The _miner's truck_, used for\r\n  drawing the earth from the end of the gallery to the bottom of the\r\n  shaft, is a small wooden truck holding about 2 cub. ft. of earth.\r\n  Formerly the noise of the wheels of the truck passing over the uneven\r\n  wooden floor of the gallery was very liable to be heard by the enemy.\r\n  To obviate this they now have leather tyres and should run on battens\r\n  nailed to the floor. The _miner's bucket_ is a small canvas bucket\r\n  with a couple of ropes attached, by which the earth can be drawn up\r\n  the shaft. Nowadays, however, the truck itself has chains attached to\r\n  it, by which it is drawn up, with the aid of a windlass, to the\r\n  surface. By this method more earth can be taken up in one lift, and\r\n  time and labour are not wasted in transferring the contents of the\r\n  truck to the bucket.\r\n\r\n  _Ventilation_ is an important point. The breath of the miners and the\r\n  burning of their candles (when electric light is not available)\r\n  vitiates the air in the galleries; so that even in clean ground a\r\n  gallery should not be driven more than 60 ft. without providing some\r\n  means of renewing the air. This is usually done by forcing fresh air,\r\n  by means of a pump or bellows, through a flexible hose to the head of\r\n  the gallery. Where mines have been fired close by, there is great\r\n  danger from poisonous gases filtering through the soil into the\r\n  gallery. This difficulty is nowadays met by the use of special\r\n  apparatus, such as helmets into which fresh air is pumped, so that the\r\n  wearers need not breathe the air of the gallery at all. Ventilation\r\n  can also be assisted by boring holes vertically to the surface of the\r\n  ground.\r\n\r\n  Where a point has been reached at which it is proposed to fire a mine,\r\n  a chamber just large enough to hold the charge is cut in the side of\r\n  the gallery. The object of this is to keep the charge out of the\r\n  direct line of the gallery and thus increase the force of the\r\n  explosion. The charge may be placed in canvas bags, barrels or boxes,\r\n  precautions being taken against damp.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Charging mines.\r\n\r\n  The operation of loading is of the first importance, for if the mine\r\n  is not exploded with success, not only is valuable time lost, which\r\n  may give the enemy his opportunity, but it will probably be necessary\r\n  to untamp the mine in order to renew the fuze; an operation attended\r\n  by considerable danger. The loading of the mine should therefore be\r\n  done by the officer in charge with his own hands. He has to work in a\r\n  very cramped position and practically in the dark (unless with\r\n  electric light) as of course no naked lights can be allowed near\r\n  powder. Everything should therefore be prepared beforehand to\r\n  facilitate the loading of the mine and placing of the fuze. At Chatham\r\n  a 1000 lb. mine, at the end of a gallery 136 ft. long, has been loaded\r\n  in 30 minutes. The powder was passed up the gallery by hand in\r\n  sandbags, and emptied into a box of the required size.\r\n\r\n  Whatever method of firing (see below) is employed, the officer who\r\n  loads the mine must be careful to see that it is so arranged as to\r\n  make firing certain, and that the leads passing out of the gallery are\r\n  not liable to damage in the process of tamping.\r\n\r\n  _Tamping._--This operation consists in filling up the head of the\r\n  gallery solidly, for such a distance that there shall be no\r\n  possibility of the charge wasting its force along the gallery. The\r\n  distance depends on the charge and on the solidity of the tamping. For\r\n  a common mine it should extend to about 3/2 L.L.R. from the charge,\r\n  when the tamping is of earth in sandbags; for a 3-lined crater, to\r\n  about 2 L.L.R. Tamping can be improved by jamming pieces of timber\r\n  across the shaft or gallery among the other filling.\r\n\r\n  _Firing._--This may be done electrically, or by means of _safety_ or\r\n  _instantaneous fuze_ or _powder hose_.\r\n\r\n  Electric firing is the safest and best, and allows of the charge being\r\n  exploded at any given moment. For this purpose _electric fuzes_ (for\r\n  powder) or _electric detonators_ (for guncotton or other high\r\n  explosive) are employed. The current that fires them is passed through\r\n  copper wire leads.\r\n\r\n  The safety fuze used in the British service burns at the rate of about\r\n  3 ft. a minute. Instantaneous fuze burns at the rate of a mile a\r\n  minute. Both can be fired under water. They are often used in\r\n  conjunction, a considerable length of instantaneous fuze, leading from\r\n  the charge, being connected to a short length of safety fuze.\r\n\r\n  Powder hose, an old-time expedient, can be extemporized by making a\r\n  tube of strong linen, say 1 in. in diameter, and filling it with\r\n  powder. It burns at the rate of 10 to 20 ft. per second.\r\n\r\n  _Explosives._--The old-fashioned gunpowder of the grained black\r\n  variety is still the best for most kinds of military mines. Pebble and\r\n  prism powders do not give as good results, presumably because their\r\n  action is so slow that some of the gases of explosion can escape\r\n  through the pores of the earth. High explosives, with their quick\r\n  shattering and rending effect, are little more effective than\r\n  gunpowder in actually moving large quantities of earth. Most of them\r\n  give off much more poisonous fumes than gunpowder. Some recent high\r\n  explosives, however, have been specially designed to be comparatively\r\n  innocuous in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Effects of mines.\r\n\r\nSome formulae have been given above for the calculation of charges. It\r\nwill, however, simplify matters for the reader to record some actual\r\ninstances of charges fired both in peace and war.\r\n\r\n  In the matter of scientific experiment we find Vauban as usual leading\r\n  the way, and the following results among others were obtained by him\r\n  at Tournay in 1686 and 1689: A charge of 162 lb. placed 13 ft. below\r\n  the surface produced a crater of 13 ft. radius (a two-lined crater, or\r\n  \"common mine\"). Galleries were destroyed at distances equal to the\r\n  L.L.R. in both horizontal and vertical directions. Double the charge,\r\n  placed at double the depth, i.e. 324 lb. with an L.L.R. of 27 ft. made\r\n  no crater, but like the first destroyed galleries below it and on each\r\n  side at distances equal to the L.L.R. A charge of 3828 lb. with L.L.R.\r\n  of 37 ft. made a two-lined crater and destroyed a gallery distant 61\r\n  ft. horizontally.\r\n\r\n  Bernard Forest de Belidor, a French engineer, made many experiments at\r\n  La Fere about 1732, and 20 years later, as a general officer and\r\n  inspector of miners, continued them on a larger scale. His experiments\r\n  were directed towards destroying an enemy's galleries at greater\r\n  distances than had hitherto been supposed possible, by means of very\r\n  large charges (in proportion to the L.L.R.) which he called \"globes of\r\n  compression.\" In one of them a charge of 4320 lb. of powder placed\r\n  only 15 ft. 9 in. below the surface damaged or \"compressed\" a gallery\r\n  distant 65 ft. horizontally. The radius of the crater was 34 ft. 8 in.\r\n\r\n  At Frederick the Great's siege of Schweidnitz in 1762 some very large\r\n  charges were exploded. One of them, of 5400 lb. with an L.L.R. of 16\r\n  ft. 3 in., made a crater of 42 ft. 3 in. radius. Readers of Carlyle's\r\n  _Frederick the Great_ may recall his description of the contest of the\r\n  rival engineers on this occasion.\r\n\r\n  At Graudenz in 1862 (experiments) a charge of 1031 lb. of powder\r\n  placed 10 ft. deep, untamped, in a vertical shaft, made a crater of 15\r\n  ft. 6 in. radius. A charge of 412 lb. of guncotton, calculated as\r\n  being equivalent to the above charge of powder and placed under the\r\n  same conditions, made a crater of 14 ft. radius. The absence of\r\n  tamping in both cases of course placed the gunpowder at a\r\n  disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Petersburg Mine, 1864.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps the most interesting mine ever fired was that at the siege of\r\n  Petersburg in the American Civil War, in June 1864. The circumstances\r\n  were all abnormal, and the untechnical account of it in _Battles and\r\n  Leaders of the Civil War_ (vol. iv.) is well worth perusal. No mining\r\n  tools or materials and no military miners were available; and no one\r\n  had any confidence in the success of the attempt except its\r\n  originator, Lieut.-Colonel Pleasants, a mining engineer by profession,\r\n  his regiment which was recruited from a mining population, and General\r\n  Burnside the corps commander. The opposing entrenchments were 130 yds.\r\n  apart. The mine gallery was started behind the Federal lines and\r\n  driven a distance of 510 ft. till it came under a field redoubt in the\r\n  Confederate lines. There two branches were made right and left, each\r\n  about 38 ft. long, and in them eight mines aggregating 8000 lb. of\r\n  powder were placed. The first attempt to fire them failed, and an\r\n  officer and a sergeant volunteered to enter the gallery to seek the\r\n  cause of the failure. A defective splice in two lengths of fuze was\r\n  thus discovered and repaired. At the second attempt all the mines were\r\n  fired simultaneously with success, and made a gigantic crater 170 ft.\r\n  long by 60 ft. wide and 30 ft. deep. The occupants of the redoubt, at\r\n  least several hundred men (they have been stated at 1000), were blown\r\n  up and mostly killed. The assault which followed, however, failed\r\n  completely, for want of organization. The infantry was drawn up in\r\n  readiness to advance, but no outlets had been provided from the\r\n  parallel, and this and other causes delayed the occupation of the\r\n  crater and gave the defending artillery a moment's respite. Thus the\r\n  assailants gained the crater but could not advance beyond it in face\r\n  of the defenders' fire, nor could they establish themselves within it,\r\n  on its steep clay sides, for want of entrenching tools. A good many\r\n  troops were sent forwards in support, but being in many cases of\r\n  inferior quality, they could not be induced to go forward, and huddled\r\n  in disorder in the already overcrowded crater. Over 1000 of these were\r\n  captured when the Confederates retook the crater by a counter-attack\r\n  and the total loss of the Federals in the attack was nearly 4000.\r\n\r\nThe wars of the last generation have done little or nothing to advance\r\nthe science of military mining, but a good deal has been done in peace\r\nto improve the means. Electric lighting and electric firing of mines\r\nwill be a great help; modern drilling machines may be used to go through\r\nrock; ventilating arrangements are much improved; and the use of bored\r\nmines is sure to have great developments. The Russo-Japanese War taught\r\nnothing new in mine-warfare, or as to the effects of mines, but the\r\nsiege of Port Arthur had this moral among others; just as in future, in\r\nthe frontal attack of positions, trench must oppose trench, so in\r\nfortress warfare mines will be more necessary than ever. It appears that\r\nthey will be essential to destroy both the ditch-flanking arrangements\r\nof forts and the escarp or other permanent obstacle beyond the ditch.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. FIELD FORTIFICATION\r\n\r\n_Field Fortifications_, now more often spoken of as field defences, are\r\nthose which are constructed at short notice, with the means locally\r\navailable, usually when the enemy is near at hand. Subject to the\r\nquestion of time, a very high degree of strength can be given to them,\r\nif the military situation makes it worth while to expend sufficient\r\nlabour. A century or more ago, the dividing line between permanent and\r\nfield fortification was very rigidly drawn, since in those days a high\r\nmasonry escarp surmounted by a rampart was essential to a permanent\r\nfortress, and these could naturally not be extemporized. Works without\r\nmasonry, in other ways made as strong as possible with deep ditches and\r\nheavy timbers,--such as would require about six weeks for their\r\nconstruction--were known as _semi-permanent_, and were used for the\r\ndefence of places which acquired strategic importance in the course of a\r\nwar, but were not immediately threatened. The term _field_ fortification\r\nwas reserved for works constructed of lighter materials, with parapets\r\nand ditches of only moderate development. Redoubts of this class\r\nrequired a fortnight at most for their construction.\r\n\r\nIn modern fortification if cupolas and deep revetted ditches were\r\nessential to permanent defences, the dividing line would be equally\r\nclear. But as has been shown, this is not universally admitted, and\r\nwhere the resources exist, the use of our present means of\r\nconstruction, such as steel joists, railway rails, reinforced concrete\r\nand wire, in conjunction with the defensive power of modern firearms,\r\nmakes it possible to extemporize in a very short time works having much\r\nof the resisting power of a permanent fortress. Further, such works can\r\nbe expanded from the smallest beginnings; and, if the site is not too\r\nexposed, in the presence of the enemy.\r\n\r\nField fortification offers, as regards the actual constructions, a very\r\nlimited scope to the engineer; and a little consideration will show that\r\nits defensive possibilities were not greatly affected by the change from\r\nmachine-thrown projectiles to those fired by rude smooth-bore guns.\r\nThere is therefore nothing in the history of this branch of the subject\r\nthat is worth tracing, from the earliest ages to about the end of the\r\n18th century. One or two points may be noticed. The use of obstacles is\r\nprobably one of the earliest measures of defence. Long before missile\r\nweapons had acquired such an importance as to make it worth while to\r\nseek shelter from them, it would obviously have been found desirable to\r\nhave some means of checking the onrush of an enemy physically or\r\nnumerically superior. Hence the use by savage tribes, to this day, of\r\npits, pointed stakes hidden in the grass, entanglements and similar\r\nobstacles. In this direction the ages have made no change, and the most\r\nhighly civilized nations still use the same obstacles on occasion.\r\n\r\nAnother use of field defences common to all ages is the protection of\r\ncamps at night, where small forces are operating against an enemy more\r\nnumerous but inferior in arms and discipline. In daylight such an enemy\r\nis not feared, but at night his numbers might be dangerous. Hence the\r\nRoman practice of making each foot-soldier carry a couple of stakes for\r\npalisades; and the simple defence of a thorn zariba used by the British\r\nfor their camps in the Sudan.\r\n\r\nPalisades and trenches, abatis and sharpened stakes have always been\r\nused. Except wire, there is practically no new material. As to methods,\r\nthe laagers of the Boers are preceded by the wagon-forts of the\r\nHussites, and those no doubt by similar arrangements of British or\r\nAssyrian war chariots; and so in almost every direction it will be found\r\nthat the expedient of to-day has had its forerunners in those of the\r\ncountless yesterdays. The only really marked change in the arrangements\r\nof field defences has been caused not by gunpowder but by quick-firing\r\nrifled weapons. For that reason it is worth while to consider briefly\r\nwhat were the principles of field fortification at the end of the 18th\r\ncentury. That period has been chosen because it gives us the result of a\r\ncouple of centuries of constant fighting between disciplined troops with\r\nfairly effective firearms. The field defences of the 19th century are\r\ntransitional in character. Based mainly on the old methods, they show\r\nonly faint attempts at adaptation to new conditions, and it was not till\r\nquite the end of the century that the methods now accepted began to take\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe essential elements of fieldworks up to the time of the Peninsular\r\nWar were _command_ and _obstacle_; now they are _protection_ and\r\n_concealment_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old type of field defences.\r\n\r\nThe command and obstacle were as necessary in the days of smooth-bore\r\nmuskets and guns as in those of javelins and arrows. When the enemy\r\ncould get close up to a work without serious loss, and attack in close\r\norder, the defenders needed a really good obstacle in front of them.\r\nMoreover, since they could not rely on their fire alone to repulse the\r\nattack, they needed a two-deep line, with reserves close at hand, to\r\nmeet it with the \"arme blanche.\" For this purpose a parapet 7 or 8 ft.\r\nhigh, with a steep slope, perhaps palisaded, up which the attackers must\r\nclimb after passing the obstacle, was excellent. The defenders after\r\nfiring their last volley could use their bayonets from the top of the\r\nparapet with the advantage of position. The high parapet had also the\r\nadvantage that the attackers could not tell what was going on inside the\r\nredoubt, and the defenders were sheltered from their fire as well from\r\nview until the last moment.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a fortified line in the 18th century depended\r\nprincipally on its redoubts. Lines of shelter trenches had little power\r\nof defence at the time, unless they held practically as many men as\r\nwould have sufficed to fight in the open. Obstacles on the other hand\r\nhad a greater value, against the inelastic tactics of the time, than\r\nthey have now. A good position therefore was one which offered good\r\nfire-positions for redoubts and plenty of facilities for creating\r\nobstacles. Strong redoubts which could resist determined assaults; good\r\nobstacles in the intervals, guns in the redoubts to sweep the intervals,\r\nand troops in formed bodies kept in reserve for counter-strokes--these\r\nwere the essentials in the days of the smooth-bore.\r\n\r\nThe redoubts were liable to a heavy cannonade by field-guns before the\r\nattack. To withstand this, the parapets had to be made of a suitable\r\nthickness--from 4 or 5 ft. upwards--according to the time available, the\r\nresisting nature of the soil, and the severity of the bombardment\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the earth for the parapet was as a rule obtained from the\r\nditch, in order to make as much as possible of this obstacle. The\r\ngarrison in all parts of the interior of the redoubt were to be\r\nsheltered, if possible, from the enemy's fire, and with this object\r\ngreat pains were bestowed on the principle of \"defilade.\" The object of\r\ndefilade, which was a great fetish in theoretical works, was so to\r\narrange the height of the parapet with reference to the terreplein of a\r\nwork that a straight line (not, be it observed, the trajectory of the\r\nprojectiles) passing from the muzzle of a musket or gun on the most\r\ncommanding point of the enemy's position, over the crest of the parapet,\r\nshould just clear the head of a defender standing in any part of the\r\nwork. This problem of defilade became quite out of date after the\r\ndevelopment of time shrapnel, but was nevertheless taught with great\r\nrigour till within the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe sectional area of the ditch was calculated so that with an addition\r\nof about 10% for expansion it would equal that of the parapet. If a\r\nwider and deeper ditch was considered necessary, the surplus earth could\r\nbe used to form a glacis.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the redoubt had to afford sufficient space to allow the\r\ngarrison to sleep in it, which was sometimes a matter of some difficulty\r\nif a small irregularly shaped work had to contain a strong garrison.\r\nConsideration of the plan and sections of these works will show that the\r\nbanquette for infantry with its slopes, and the gun platforms, took off\r\na good deal from the interior space within the crest-line. Guns were\r\nusually placed at the salients, where they could get the widest field of\r\nfire. They were sometimes placed on the ground level, firing through\r\nembrasures in the parapet, and sometimes on platforms so as to fire over\r\nthe parapet (_en barbette_).\r\n\r\nAs in permanent fortification, immense pains were taken to elaborate\r\ntheoretically the traces of works. A distinction was made between forts\r\nand redoubts, the former being those which were arranged to flank their\r\nown ditches, while the redoubts did not. Redoubts again were classed as\r\n\"closed,\" those which had an equally strong defence all round; and\r\n\"half-closed,\" those which had only a slight parapet or timber stockade\r\nfor the gorge or rear faces. Open works (those which had no gorge\r\ndefence) were named according to their trace, as _redans_ and\r\n_lunettes_. A redan is a work with two faces making a salient angle. It\r\nwas frequently used in connexion with straight lines of trench or\r\nbreastwork. A lunette is a work with two faces, usually forming an\r\nobtuse angle, and two flanks.\r\n\r\nThe forts described in the text-books, as might be expected, were\r\ndesigned with great ingenuity, with bastioned or demi-bastioned fronts,\r\nstar traces, and so forth, and in the same books intricate calculations\r\nwere entered into to balance the _remblai_ and _deblai_, that is, the\r\namount of earth in the parapets with that excavated from the ditches. In\r\npractice such niceties of course disappeared, though occasionally when\r\nthe ground allowed of it star forts and bastioned fronts were employed.\r\n\r\nOn irregular ground the first necessity was to fit the redoubt to the\r\nground on which it stood, so as to sweep the whole of the foreground,\r\nand this was generally a sufficiently difficult matter without adding\r\nthe complications of flanking defences. Sir John Jones, speaking of the\r\ntraces of the several works in the Torres Vedras lines, says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\n  \"The redoubts were made of every capacity, from that of fig. 74 a,\r\n  limited by want of space on the ground it occupied to 50 men and two\r\n  pieces of artillery, to that of fig. 74 b, for 500 men and six pieces\r\n  of artillery, the importance of the object to be attained being the\r\n  only guide in forming the dimensions. Many of the redoubts first\r\n  thrown up, even some of the smallest, were shaped like stars, under\r\n  the idea of procuring a flank defence for the ditches; but this\r\n  construction was latterly rejected, it being found to cut up the\r\n  interior space, and to be almost fallacious with respect to flank\r\n  defence, the breadth of the exterior slopes being in some cases equal\r\n  to the whole length of the flanks so obtained. Even when, from the\r\n  greater size of the work, some flanking fire was thus gained, the\r\n  angle formed by the faces was generally so obtuse that it demanded\r\n  more coolness in the defenders than ought reasonably to be expected to\r\n  aim along the ditch of the opposite face: and further, this\r\n  construction prevented the fire of the work being more powerful in\r\n  front than in rear.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Torres Vedras Works.]\r\n\r\n  In order to decide on the proper trace of a work, it is necessary to\r\n  consider whether its object be to prevent an enemy establishing\r\n  himself on the ground on which it is to be placed, or whether it be to\r\n  insure a heavy fire of artillery on some other point in its vicinity.\r\n  In the first case every consideration should be sacrificed to that of\r\n  adding to its powers of self-defence by flanks or other expedients. In\r\n  the second, its powers of resistance are secondary to the\r\n  establishment of a powerful offensive fire and its trace cannot be too\r\n  simple. Latterly, the shape of the redoubts was invariably that most\r\n  fitted to the ground, or such as best parried the enfilade fire or\r\n  musketry plunge of neighbouring heights, care being taken to present\r\n  the front of fire deemed necessary towards the pass, or other object\r\n  to be guarded; and such will generally be found the best rule of\r\n  proceeding.\r\n\r\n  This recommendation, however, is not intended to apply to isolated\r\n  works of large dimensions, and more particularly to those considered\r\n  the key of any position. No labour or expense should be spared to\r\n  render such works capable of resisting the most furious assaults,\r\n  either by breaking the parapet into flanks, or forming a flank defence\r\n  in the ditch; for the experience gained in the Peninsula shows that an\r\n  unflanked work of even more than an ordinary field profile, if\r\n  skilfully and determinedly assaulted, will generally be carried....\r\n  Nor does the serious evil of curtailing the interior space, which\r\n  renders breaks in the outline so objectionable in small works, apply\r\n  to works of large dimensions.... Under this view the great work on\r\n  Monte Agraca (fig. 75) must be considered as very defective, the flank\r\n  defence being confined to an occasional break of a few feet in the\r\n  trace, caused by a change of direction in the contour of the height,\r\n  whilst the interior space is more than doubly sufficient for the\r\n  number of its allotted garrison to encamp.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Monte Agraca, Torres Vedras.]\r\n\r\n  _Interior and other Defences._--This work, however, had some of its\r\n  salient points ... cut off by earthen lines of parapet, steeply\r\n  revetted externally, and so traced as to serve for traverses to the\r\n  interior. It had also three or four small enclosed posts formed within\r\n  it; and the work at Torres Vedras (fig. 76) had each of its salient\r\n  points formed into an independent post. These interior defences and\r\n  retrenchments were intended to guard against a general panic amongst\r\n  the garrison, which would necessarily be composed in part of\r\n  indifferent troops, and also to prevent the loss of the work by the\r\n  entry of the assailants at any weak or ill-defended point. Such\r\n  interior lines to rally on are absolutely essential to the security of\r\n  a large field-work. They serve as substitutes for a blockhouse or\r\n  tower, placed in the interior of all well-constructed permanent\r\n  earthen works, and merit far more attention than they generally\r\n  receive.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Torres Vedras Works.]\r\n\r\n  The small circular windmills of stone, which were frequently found\r\n  occupying salient knolls ... readily converted into admirable interior\r\n  posts of that nature. The profile of the several works varied on every\r\n  face and flank, according to its liability to be attacked or\r\n  cannonaded; the only general rule enforced being that all ditches\r\n  should be at least 15 ft. wide at top and 10 ft. in depth, and the\r\n  crest of the parapet have at least 5 ft. command over the crest of the\r\n  counterscarp. No parapet exceeded 10 ft. in thickness, unless exposed\r\n  to be severely cannonaded, and few more than 6 or 8 ft.; and some, on\r\n  high knolls, where artillery could not by any possibility be brought\r\n  against them, were made of stone or rubble less than 2 ft. in\r\n  thickness, to gain more interior space, and allow full liberty for the\r\n  use of the defenders' bayonets.\"\r\n\r\n  Fig. 77 gives two typical sections of these works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe works of Torres Vedras have been chosen for illustration because\r\nthey offer very good historical examples, and also because of the value\r\nof the critical remarks of Sir John Jones, who as a captain was the\r\nengineer in charge of their construction. At the same time it must be\r\nremembered that they differ from ordinary field-works in having an\r\nunusual degree of strength, plenty of time and civilian labour having\r\nbeen available for their construction. In this respect they approximate\r\nmore to semi-permanent works, the main reason why they did not receive\r\nunder the circumstances a greater development of ditch and parapet being\r\nthat in addition to the large number of works required, much labour was\r\nexpended in abatis, inundations, scarping hill-sides and constructing\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nSome further remarks of Sir John on the _situations of the works_ are\r\nvery instructive:--\r\n\r\n  \"Many of the redoubts were placed on very elevated situations on the\r\n  summit of steep hills, which gave them a most imposing appearance;\r\n  but it was in reality a defect ... for the fire of their artillery on\r\n  the object to be guarded became so plunging as to lose half its\r\n  powers; the musketry could not be made to scour the face of the hill\r\n  sufficiently; and during the night both arms became of most uncertain\r\n  effect.\r\n\r\n  \"The domineering situation of the redoubts, however, gave confidence\r\n  to the young troops which composed their garrisons, protected them\r\n  from a cannonade, and screened their interior from musketry, unless\r\n  fired at a high angle, and consequently at random. These\r\n  considerations perhaps justify the unusually elevated sites selected\r\n  for most of the redoubts on the lines, though they cannot induce an\r\n  approval of them as a general measure.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief principle of the period was thus that the redoubts were the\r\nmost important features of lines of defence, and that they combined\r\nphysical obstacle and protection with good musketry and artillery\r\npositions. The value of concealment was not ignored, but it was as a\r\nrule subordinated to other considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  19th century.\r\n\r\nThe principles of this time remained unaltered until after the Crimean\r\nWar. In the American Civil War the power of the rifle began to assert\r\nitself, and it was found that a simple breastwork defended by a double\r\nrank of men could protect itself by its fire against an ordinary\r\nassault. This power of the rifle gave greatly enhanced importance to any\r\ndefences that could be hastily extemporized behind walls, hedges or any\r\nnatural cover. About the period of the Franco-German War other\r\nconsiderations came in. The increased velocity of artillery projectiles\r\nreduced in some ways their destructive effects against earth parapets,\r\nbecause the shell had an increasing tendency to deflect upwards on\r\nstriking a bank of loose earth. Also the use of shrapnel made it\r\nimpossible for troops to find cover on the terreplein of a work some\r\ndistance behind the parapet.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, however, were not fully realized at that time. The\r\nreason was partly a want of touch between the engineers and the\r\nnon-technical branches of most armies, and partly that original writers\r\nfrom the Napoleonic wars to the present day have been more occupied with\r\nthe primary question of the value of field defences as a matter of\r\ntactics than with their details considered from the standpoint of\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\nThere was always an influential school of writers who declaimed against\r\nall defences, as being injurious to the offensive spirit so essential to\r\nsuccess. Those writers who treated of the arrangements of defences\r\ndevoted themselves to theoretical details of trace quite after the old\r\nstyle; discussing the size and shape of typical redoubts, their distance\r\napart and relation to lines of trenches, &c. The profiles--the thick\r\nparapet with command of 7 ft. or more, the deep ditch, and the\r\ninadequate cover behind the parapet--remained as they had been for a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe American Civil War showed the power of rifles behind slight\r\ndefences. Plevna in 1877 taught a further lesson. It proved the great\r\nresisting power of extemporized lines; but more than that, we begin to\r\nfind new arrangements for protection against shell fire (see plans and\r\nsections in Greene's _The Russian Army and its Campaign in Turkey_). The\r\ntrace of the works and the sections of parapet and ditch suggest Torres\r\nVedras; but a multiplication of interior traverses and splinter-proof\r\nshelters show the necessity for a different class of protection. The\r\nparapet was designed according to the old type, for want of a better;\r\nthe traverses and shelters were added later, to meet the necessities of\r\nthe case. The Turks also used two or three tiers of musketry fire, as\r\nfor instance one from the crest of the glacis, one from the parapet, and\r\none from a traverse in rear of it. This, however, is a development which\r\nwill not be necessary in future, thanks to magazine rifles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Principles of modern field defences.\r\n\r\nFrom 1877 to 1899 the efficiency of rifles and guns rapidly increased,\r\nand certain new principles, causing the field defences of the present\r\nday to differ radically from those of the 18th century, remained to be\r\ndeveloped. These may be considered under the following heads: the nature\r\nof protection required, the diminished need of obstacle, and the\r\nadaptation of works to ground.\r\n\r\nThe principle that _thickness_ of parapet is no longer required, to\r\nresist artillery fire, was first laid down at Chatham in 1896. The\r\ndistance at which guns now engage makes direct hits on parapets\r\ncomparatively rare. Further, a shell striking near the crest of a\r\nparapet may perhaps kill one man if he is in the way, and displace a\r\nbushel of earth. That is nothing. It is the contents of the shell,\r\nwhether shrapnel or explosive, that is the source of danger and not the\r\nshell itself. Thus the enemy's object is to burst his common shell\r\nimmediately behind the parapet, or his shrapnel a short distance in\r\nfront of it, in order to get searching effect. It follows that a parapet\r\nis thick enough if it suffices to stop rifle bullets, since the same\r\nthickness will _a fortiori_ keep out shrapnel bullets or splinters of\r\nshell. For this purpose 3 ft. is enough.\r\n\r\nReal protection is gained by a trench close in rear of the parapet, deep\r\nenough to give shelter from high angle shrapnel, and narrow enough to\r\nminimize the chance of a common shell dropping into it. This protection\r\nis increased by frequent traverses across the trench.\r\n\r\nThe most essential point of all is _concealment_. In gaining this we say\r\ngood-bye finally to the old type of work. Protection is now given by the\r\ntrench rather than the parapet; command and the ditch-obstacle (which\r\nfurnished the earth for the high parapet) are alike unnecessary.\r\nConcealment can therefore be studied by keeping the parapet down to the\r\nlowest level above the surface from which the foreground can be seen.\r\nThis may be 18 in. or less.\r\n\r\nThe need of obstacle, in daylight and when the defenders are not\r\nabnormally few, has practically disappeared. For night work, or when the\r\nassailant is so strong as to be able to force home his attack in face of\r\nprotected rifle fire, what is needed is not a deep ditch immediately in\r\nfront of the parapet, difficult to climb, but also difficult to flank,\r\nbut an obstacle that will detain him under fire at short range. It may\r\nbe an entanglement, an abatis, an inundation: anything that will check\r\nthe rush and make him move slowly.\r\n\r\nIn the _adaptation of works to ground_, the governing factor is the\r\npower of the rifle in frontal defence. We have seen that in Peninsular\r\ntimes great reliance was placed on the flanking defence of lines by guns\r\nin redoubts. Infantry extended behind a simple line of trench could not\r\nresist a strong attack without such support. Now, however, infantry\r\nbehind a slight trench, with a good field of fire should be able to\r\ndefend themselves against any infantry attack.\r\n\r\nThis being so, the enemy's artillery seeks to locate the trenches and to\r\ncover them with a steady hail of shells, so as to force the defenders to\r\nkeep down under cover. If they can succeed in doing this, it is possible\r\nfor the attacking infantry to advance, and the artillery fire is kept up\r\nuntil the last moment, so that the attack may have the narrowest\r\npossible space to cover after the defenders have manned their parapets\r\nand opened fire. Fig. 78 shows the action of various natures of\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering_, by permission of the Controller\r\nof H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\nFIG. 78.--Effect of Projectiles.]\r\n\r\nWe need not here discuss the role of the defenders' artillery in\r\nreplying to that of the enemy and playing on the attack; nor for the\r\nmoment consider how far the defence of the trenches while under\r\nartillery fire can be made easier by overhead cover. The main question\r\nis--what is, in view of the nature of the attack, the best disposition\r\nof lines of trench; and do they require the addition of redoubts?\r\n\r\nThe most important point, with the object of protection, is that the\r\ntrenches must not be conspicuous; this is the best defence against\r\nartillery. With the object of resistance by their own fire they must\r\nhave a good view, or, as it is generally described, no _dead ground_ in\r\nfront of them. For this purpose 300 or 400 yds. may be enough if the\r\nground is even and affords no cover.\r\n\r\nThis necessity for invisibility, together with the shallowness of the\r\nzone that suffices for producing a decisive fire effect, has of late\r\nyears very much affected the choice of ground for a line of trenches.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Siting of trenches.\r\n\r\n  For a defensive position on high ground, it was usually laid down\r\n  until the South African War that a line of trenches should be on the\r\n  \"military crest\" (Fr. _crete militaire_), _i.e._ the highest point on\r\n  the hill from which the whole of the slopes in front can be seen. Thus\r\n  in the three sections of ground shown in fig. 79 it would be at a, b\r\n  and c respectively. The simplicity of this prescription made it\r\n  attractive and it came to be rather abused in the text-books. There\r\n  were, even before the improvements in artillery, objections to it,\r\n  because on most slopes the military crest would be found at very\r\n  different elevations on different parts of the line, so that by a\r\n  strict adherence to the rule some of the trenches would be placed near\r\n  the top of the hill, and some in dangerous isolation near the bottom.\r\n  Moreover a rounded hill has no military crest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 79.]\r\n\r\n  Further, we have to consider nowadays not only the position of the\r\n  fire-trenches, but those of supports, reserves and artillery, and the\r\n  whole question is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n  For instance, considering the sections alone, as if they did not vary\r\n  along the line, the positions at _a_ and _b_, fig. 79, are bad because\r\n  they are on the sky-line and therefore a good mark for artillery. That\r\n  at _b_ is especially bad because the slope in front is so steep that\r\n  the defenders would have to expose themselves very much to fire down\r\n  it, and the artillery fire against them can be kept up until the very\r\n  last moment. The position _c_ has the advantage of not being on the\r\n  sky-line, but the position of the supports in rear is exposed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 80.]\r\n\r\n  Such a position as that at _d_, fig. 80, is good, but protected or\r\n  concealed communications must be made for the supports coming from _e_\r\n  over the brow of the hill.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 81.]\r\n\r\n  Another possible position for the infantry line is at _f_, fig. 81,\r\n  with the guns on the high ground behind. They might easily be quite\r\n  concealed from the enemy's artillery. The drawback is that no\r\n  retirement up the exposed slope would be possible for them, except at\r\n  night. The fire from _f_ will be _grazing_, which will be a great\r\n  advantage as compared with the _plunging_ fire that would be obtained\r\n  from a position up the hill.\r\n\r\n  It is idle, however, to give more than the most cursory consideration\r\n  to sections of imaginary positions. It is only by actual practice on\r\n  the ground that skill can be attained in laying out positions, and\r\n  only a trained soldier with a good eye can succeed in it. Briefly, the\r\n  advantages of view and position given by high ground must be paid for\r\n  in some degree by exposure to the enemy's artillery; and at least as\r\n  much consideration--possibly as much labour--must be given to\r\n  communications with the fire-trenches as to the trenches themselves.\r\n  Irregular ground simplifies the question of concealment but also gives\r\n  cover to the enemy's approach. The lie of the ground will itself\r\n  dictate the position of the trenches, subject to the predispositions\r\n  of the responsible officer. On flat featureless ground the general\r\n  trace of the trenches should be irregular. This makes a more difficult\r\n  target for artillery, and affords a certain amount of cross and\r\n  flanking fire, which is a very great advantage. Great care should,\r\n  however, be taken not to expose the trenches to oblique or enfilade\r\n  fire; or at least to protect them, if so exposed, by traversing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 82.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Trenches.\r\n\r\n  Concealment of trenches is generally attempted by covering the freshly\r\n  turned earth of the small parapet with sods, leafy branches or grass.\r\n  In this connexion it should be remembered that after a day or two cut\r\n  leaves and grass wither and may become conspicuous against a green\r\n  surface. Where the ground is so even that a good view of the\r\n  foreground is possible from the surface level, the trench may be made\r\n  without a parapet; but this entails great labour in removing and\r\n  disposing of the excavated earth. A common device is to conceal the\r\n  parapet as well as possible and to make a dummy trench some distance\r\n  away to draw fire.\r\n\r\n  Besides the direct concealment of trenches, care must be taken that\r\n  the site is not conspicuous. Thus a trench should not be placed along\r\n  the meeting line of two different kinds of cultivation, or along the\r\n  edge of a belt of heather on a hill-side, or where a difference of\r\n  gradient is sharply defined; or where any conspicuous landmark would\r\n  help the enemy's artillery to get the range.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 83.]\r\n\r\n  Trenches are broadly distinguished as \"fire trenches\" and \"cover\r\n  trenches,\" according as they are for the firing line or supporting\r\n  troops. The following simple types are taken from the 1908 edition of\r\n  _Military Engineering_ (part 1): \"Field Defences.\"\r\n\r\n  Fig. 82 is the most common form of fire trench, in which labour is\r\n  saved by equalizing trench and parapet. This would take 1-1/2 to 2\r\n  hours in ordinary soil. Fig. 83 shows the same trench improved by 2 or\r\n  3 hours' more work. Fig. 84 shows a fire trench without parapet, with\r\n  cover trench and communication.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering: Field Defences_ (1908), by\r\n  permission of the Controller H. M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.]\r\n\r\n  The addition of a loophole of sandbags on the top for concealment\r\n  (called _head-cover_), gives increased protection, but at the cost of\r\n  greater prominence for the parapet (fig. 85). Overhead cover can only\r\n  be provided in fire trenches by giving the parapet still greater\r\n  height and it is not usually done. Portions of the trench not used for\r\n  firing can, however, be given splinter-proof protection by putting\r\n  over them branches or bundles, covered with a few inches of earth: or\r\n  by boards, or sheets of corrugated iron if they can be had. A better\r\n  plan when time permits is to provide cover trenches immediately behind\r\n  and communicating with the fire trench.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering: Field Defences_, by permission\r\n  of the Controller H. M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Redoubts.\r\n\r\n  The question of redoubts has been a vexed one for years; partly they\r\n  were thought to be unnecessary in view of the resisting power of a\r\n  line of trenches, but chiefly because the redoubt was always imagined\r\n  as one of the older type, with a high conspicuous parapet. Of course a\r\n  redoubt of such a nature would be readily identified and made\r\n  untenable. But the idea of a redoubt does not necessarily imply\r\n  command. Its object is that it shall be capable of all-round defence.\r\n  There can be no doubt that as there is always a possibility of lines\r\n  being pierced somewhere, it is desirable, unless the whole line is to\r\n  be thrown into confusion and forced back, to have some point at which\r\n  the defenders can maintain themselves. This is not possible unless at\r\n  such points there is provision for defence towards both flanks and\r\n  rear, that is to say, when there are redoubts, which can hold on after\r\n  certain portions of the line have been lost and thereby can localize\r\n  the enemy's success and simplify the action of supporting troops. In\r\n  order that redoubts may exercise this function, all that is necessary\r\n  is that their defenders should be able to see the ground for a furlong\r\n  in front of them in every direction. Their parapets, therefore, need\r\n  be in no way more conspicuous than those of the neighbouring fire\r\n  trenches, and in that case there is no fear of their drawing special\r\n  attention from the enemy's artillery. Whatever theories may have been\r\n  put forward en the subject, in practice they are constantly used, and\r\n  in the Russo-Japanese War, where the experience of South Africa was\r\n  already available, we find them in the fighting lines on both sides.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 86.]\r\n\r\n  The modern type of field redoubt is a fire trench, no more conspicuous\r\n  than the others, in any simple form adapted to the ground that will\r\n  give effective all-round fire, such as a square with blunted angles.\r\n  Enhanced strength may be given by deepening the trenches and improving\r\n  the overhead cover; and special use may here be made of obstacles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 87.]\r\n\r\n  Within the redoubt cover may be provided for men in excess of those\r\n  required to man the parapet, by means of cover trenches and field\r\n  casemates. Fig. 86 gives the general idea of such a redoubt, and figs.\r\n  87, 88 the plan and section of the interior shelters. Such a work can\r\n  easily be made quite invisible from a distance. It gives excellent\r\n  cover against shrapnel, but would not be tenable against howitzer\r\n  common shell, if the enemy did manage to bring an accurate fire to\r\n  bear on it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 88.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 89 shows the section of a parapet with two shelters behind it for\r\n  a work with a high command of 5 or 6 ft. This work would require a\r\n  concealed position, which can often be found a little in rear of the\r\n  firing line.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering: Field Defences_ (1908), by\r\n  permission of the Controller H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 89.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Boer, Russian and Japanese types.\r\n\r\n  In the South African War a good deal of interest was excited by a type\r\n  of trench used by the Boers. It was very narrow at the surface, giving\r\n  only just room for a man to stand; but undercut or hollowed out below,\r\n  so that he could sit down with very good cover. Such a section is\r\n  only possible in very firm soil. Apart from this, the type is really\r\n  only suited to rifle pits, as a trench proper should have room for\r\n  officers and N.C.O's to move along within it. The Boers showed great\r\n  skill in concealing their trenches. One good point was that there was\r\n  generally something making a background immediately behind the men's\r\n  heads, so that they did not stand out in relief when raised above the\r\n  parapet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Russo-Japanese War: British Officers' Reports_,\r\n  vol. ii., by permission of the Controller H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIGS. 90 and 91.]\r\n\r\n  In the Russo-Japanese War the Russian trenches at the outset were of\r\n  old-fashioned type and very conspicuous. Later on better types were\r\n  evolved. Figs. 90 and 91 are a couple of sections from Port Arthur;\r\n  the first borrowed from the Boers but wider at the top. The Japanese\r\n  appear to have taken their type mainly from the latest British\r\n  official books, but applied them with great skill to the ground\r\n  studying especially invisibility. In their prepared positions they\r\n  used large redoubts manned by several companies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering: Field Defences_, by permission\r\n  of the Controller H. M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 92.--Gun-pit.]\r\n\r\n  _Cover for Guns._--Some degree of cover for guns, in addition to the\r\n  shield, is always desirable. If the gun stands on the natural surface\r\n  of the ground, the cover is called an epaulment. In that case a bank\r\n  is thrown up in front of the gun, about 1 ft. high in the centre, and\r\n  3 ft. 6 in. high at the ends. On either side of the gun and close up\r\n  to the bank is a small pit for the gunners. The rest of the earth for\r\n  the epaulment is got from a trench in front. If the gun is sunk, the\r\n  shelter is called a gun-pit.\r\n\r\n  In this case there is no bank immediately in front of the gun. Shelter\r\n  can be got more quickly with a pit than an epaulment, but it is\r\n  generally undesirable to break the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Obstacles.\r\n\r\n  The commonest forms of _obstacle_ now used are _abatis_ and _wire\r\n  entanglements_. Fig. 93 shows a well-finished type of abatis. The\r\n  branches are stripped and pointed, and the butts are buried and pegged\r\n  firmly down. Wire entanglement may be added to this with advantage. An\r\n  abatis should be protected from artillery fire, which is sometimes\r\n  done by placing it in a shallow excavation with the earth thrown up in\r\n  front of it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering: Field Defences_, by permission\r\n  of the Controller H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 93.--Abatis.]\r\n\r\n  Wire may be used as a _high_ or _low entanglement_ or as a fence or\r\n  trip wire or concealed obstacle. The usual form of high wire\r\n  entanglement consists of several rows of stout stakes 4 or 5 ft. long,\r\n  driven firmly into the ground about 6 ft. apart, and connected\r\n  horizontally and diagonally with barbed wire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 94.--Crows' Feet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 95.--Plan and section of Trous-de-loup.]\r\n\r\n  _Palisades_ are still used, and need no description. They were\r\n  formerly often made bullet-proof, but this is no longer possible.\r\n  _Fraises_ are seldom heard of now, though they may appear occasionally\r\n  in a modified form. They were much used in connexion with deep\r\n  ditches, and are palisades placed so as to project horizontally from\r\n  the escarp, or sloping forward in the bottom of the ditch. _Military\r\n  pits_ both _deep_ and _shallow_ (the latter, shown in fig. 95, called\r\n  _trous de loup_) are not so much used as formerly, because the\r\n  obstacle is hardly worth the labour expended on it. Both, however,\r\n  were employed in the Russo-Japanese War. _Crows' feet_, formerly much\r\n  used as a defence against cavalry, are practically obsolete. They\r\n  consisted of four iron spikes joined together at their bases in such a\r\n  manner that however they were thrown down one point would always be\r\n  pointing upwards (fig. 94). _Chevaux-de-frise_ (q.v.) were formerly a\r\n  much-used type of obstacle.\r\n\r\n  The best obstacle is that which can be made to fulfil a given object\r\n  with the least expenditure of time and labour. From this point of view\r\n  barbed wire is far the best. One of its greatest advantages is that it\r\n  gives no cover whatever to the enemy.\r\n\r\n  _Fougasses_ have always for convenience been classed as obstacles. A\r\n  fougasse is a charge of powder buried at the bottom of a sloping pit.\r\n  Over the powder is a wooden shield, 3 or 4 in. thick, and over the\r\n  shield a quantity of stones are piled. The illustration, fig. 96,\r\n  gives a clear idea of the arrangement. A fougasse of this form,\r\n  charged with 80 lb. of powder, will throw 5 tons of stones over a\r\n  surface 160 yds. long by 120 wide. They may be fired by powder hose,\r\n  fuze or electricity. Their actual effect is very often a matter of\r\n  chance, but the moral effect is usually considerable.\r\n\r\n  _Dams_ are most effective obstacles, when circumstances allow of their\r\n  use. They are constructed by military engineers as small temporary\r\n  dams would be in civil works.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Illumination.\r\n\r\n  A most important question, especially in connexion with obstacles, is\r\n  that of lighting up the foreground at night. Portable electric\r\n  searchlights are most valuable, especially for detecting the enemy's\r\n  movements at some distance; but their use will naturally always be\r\n  restricted. Star shells and parachute lights fired from guns are not\r\n  of much use for the immediate foreground, and do not burn very long.\r\n  They were formerly chiefly of use in siege works, to light up an\r\n  enemy's working parties. Germany has introduced lightballs fired from\r\n  pistols, which will probably have a considerable future.\r\n\r\n  Various civilian forms of _flare-light_ would be very useful to\r\n  illuminate obstacles, but cannot well be carried in the field.\r\n  _Bonfires_ are very useful when material is available. They require\r\n  careful treatment, _e.g._ they must be so arranged that they can be\r\n  lighted instantaneously (they may be lighted automatically, by means\r\n  of a trip wire and a fuze); they must give a bright light at once\r\n  (this can be ensured with shavings or straw sprinkled with petroleum);\r\n  they must be firmly built so that the enemy cannot destroy them\r\n  easily; and if possible there should be a screen arranged behind them\r\n  so that they may not light up the defence as well as the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Blockhouses.\r\n\r\n  Blockhouses are familiar to the public from the part they played in\r\n  the South African War of 1899-1902. In the old-fashioned permanent\r\n  fortification they were used as keeps in such positions as re-entering\r\n  places of arms and built of masonry. Stone blockhouses have long been\r\n  used in the Balkans for frontier outposts; they are sometimes built\r\n  cruciform, so as to get some flanking defence. In the form of\r\n  bullet-proof log-cabins they have played a great part in warfare\r\n  between pioneer settlers and savages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From _Mil. Engineering_, by permission of the\r\n  Controller H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 96.--Fougasse.]\r\n\r\n  In the 19th century blockhouses were usually designed to give partial\r\n  protection against field artillery; the walls being built of two\r\n  thicknesses of logs with earth between them, the roof flat and covered\r\n  with 2 or 3 ft. of earth, and earth being piled against the walls up\r\n  to the loopholes. Nowadays they are employed only in positions where\r\n  it is not likely that artillery will be brought against them: but they\r\n  may be made tenable for a while even under artillery fire if they are\r\n  surrounded by a trench and parapet.\r\n\r\n  Blockhouses are especially useful for small posts protecting such\r\n  points as railway bridges, which the enemy may attempt to destroy by\r\n  cavalry raids. The essential feature is a bullet-proof loopholed wall,\r\n  arranged for all-round fire, with enough interior space for the\r\n  garrison to sleep in. The roof may be simply weatherproof. Some\r\n  arrangement for storing water must be provided. Circular blockhouses\r\n  were very popular in South Africa. They were made of sheets of\r\n  corrugated iron fastened 6 in. apart on a wooden framework, the space\r\n  between the sheets being filled with small stones. The loopholes were\r\n  made of sheet-iron frames inserted in the walls. Fig. 97 shows a\r\n  section of one of these blockhouses.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: By permission of the Controller H.M. Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 97.--Blockhouse, South Africa, 1900-1902.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Woods.\r\n\r\n  The defence of woods was formerly an important branch of field\r\n  defences. Abatis and entanglements could readily be extemporized,\r\n  trunks of trees made strong breastworks, and the wood concealed the\r\n  numbers of the defenders. A wood was therefore generally considered a\r\n  useful addition to a line of defence. It was customary to hold the\r\n  front edge of the wood, the irregularities of the outline being\r\n  utilized for frontal and flanking fire, while obstacles were disposed\r\n  some 50 yds. in front. In a carefully prepared position, clearings\r\n  would be made parallel to the front and some distance back from it,\r\n  for support positions, and great attention was paid (in theory at\r\n  least) to clearing communications, erections, signposts, &c., so that\r\n  the defending troops might move freely in any desired direction.\r\n\r\n  Woods, however, had their inherent drawbacks. The ground is hard to\r\n  dig, clearing involves great labour; and communication, at the best,\r\n  is cramped. Nowadays a wood can hardly be considered a strong\r\n  defensive element in a line. The front of it is an excellent ranging\r\n  mark for artillery, and positions within the wood are not easily made,\r\n  because of the difficulty of trenching, and the fact that no\r\n  reasonable amount of timber will make a breastwork proof against the\r\n  modern bullet. Once an enemy gets a footing within a wood, the\r\n  position is more favourable to offensive than to defensive action. If\r\n  a wood has to be occupied in a line of defence, it is probable that in\r\n  most cases the rear edge or a line slightly behind it would be the\r\n  best to fortify, though the front edge would no doubt be held by the\r\n  fighting line at the outset.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Villages.\r\n\r\n  The defence of villages is another question which has been much\r\n  affected by recent improvements in artillery. Formerly villages were\r\n  very important adjuncts to a line of defence, and strong points for a\r\n  detached force to hold. There were indeed always drawbacks. The\r\n  preparations for defence entailed a good deal of labour, and the\r\n  defending force was scattered in houses and enclosures, so that\r\n  control and united action were difficult. But the value of the\r\n  ready-made protection afforded by walls was so great--and sometimes\r\n  even decisive--that villages were occupied as a matter of course. This\r\n  is certainly now changed, but precisely to what extent it will be\r\n  impossible to say, until after the next European war. A village under\r\n  fire is not now an ideal defensive position. A single shrapnel\r\n  penetrating the outer wall may kill all the occupants of a room; a\r\n  single field-howitzer shell may practically ruin a house. At the same\r\n  time, a house or line of houses may (without any preliminary labour at\r\n  all) give very good protection against shell fire to troops _behind_\r\n  them. Further, the value to the defence of the slightest cover, once\r\n  the infantry attack has developed, is so great that the ruins of walls\r\n  and houses occupied at the right moment may prove an impregnable\r\n  stronghold. This class of fighting, however, does not properly come\r\n  under the present heading. For the details of the defence of walls,\r\n  houses, &c., see the official _Mil. Engineering_ (1908).\r\n\r\n  _Entrenching under Fire._--Progress in this direction has been delayed\r\n  by the reluctance of military authorities to add a portable\r\n  entrenching tool to the heavy burden already carried by the infantry\r\n  soldier. Further delay has resulted from the attempts of enthusiastic\r\n  inventors to produce a tool that shall weigh nothing, go easily in the\r\n  pocket, and be available as a pick, shovel, saw, hand-axe or\r\n  corkscrew. A tool that will serve more than one use is seldom\r\n  satisfactory for any.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Extemporized cover.\r\n\r\n  The object of entrenching under fire is to enable attacking infantry,\r\n  when their advance is checked by the enemy's fire, to maintain the\r\n  ground they have won by extemporizing cover where none exists. The\r\n  need of this was first felt in the American Civil War, and towards the\r\n  close of it a small entrenching spade 22 in. long and weighing only\r\n  1-1/2 lb. was introduced by Brigadier-General H.W. Benham into the\r\n  Army of the Potomac. Since that time a great number of patterns have\r\n  been tried, including shovel, trowel and adze types. The most popular\r\n  of these has been the Linnemann spade, which is used by most\r\n  continental armies and by the Japanese. The Austrian form of this tool\r\n  is a rectangular spade with straight handle. The length over all is a\r\n  little less than 20 in. The blade is 8 in. long by 6 wide. One side of\r\n  it has a saw edge, and the other a cutting edge. For carriage, the\r\n  blade is enclosed in a leather case, which is strapped to the pack or\r\n  the waist-belt. In the British army the Wallace combined pick and\r\n  shovel was used for some time, but was eventually dropped. There was\r\n  always great doubt whether the utility of a portable entrenching tool\r\n  was such as to justify the inconvenience caused to the soldier in\r\n  carrying it. But the experience of the Russo-Japanese War seems to\r\n  have finally established the necessity of it, and also the fact that\r\n  it must generally be used lying down. For this purpose and for\r\n  convenience in carrying it on the person, a very light short-handled\r\n  tool is required.\r\n\r\n  The soldier lying down cannot attempt to dig a trench, but can make a\r\n  little hole by his side as he lies, and put the earth in front of his\r\n  head. A method introduced by the Japanese is that at each check in the\r\n  advance the front line should do this, and, as they go forward, the\r\n  supporting lines in succession should improve the cover thus\r\n  commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n    General remarks.\r\n\r\n  There are few things that soldiers dislike more, in the way of\r\n  training, than trenchwork. For men unused to it, it is tiring and\r\n  tedious work, and it is difficult for them to realize its importance.\r\n  At the same time it is a commonplace of recent history that men who\r\n  have been in action a few times develop a great affection for the\r\n  shovel. The need of trenches grows with the growth of firearms, and\r\n  the latest feature of modern tactics is the use of them in attack as\r\n  well as in defence. The observation has often been made--with what\r\n  truth as a general proposition we cannot here discuss--that modern\r\n  battles tend more and more to resemble a siege. The weaker side, it is\r\n  said, entrenches itself; the other bombards and attacks. After gaining\r\n  as much ground as they can, the attacking troops wait for nightfall\r\n  and entrench; perhaps making a further advance and entrenchment before\r\n  dawn. In the last stage the attack might even be reduced to gaining\r\n  ground by sapping. In open and featureless ground, where the rifle and\r\n  gun have full play, the trench is to the modern soldier very much what\r\n  the breast-plate was to the man-at-arms, an absolute essential.\r\n\r\n  The most important point in connexion with modern field fortification\r\n  is the effect on both strategy and tactics of the increased resisting\r\n  power of the defence. A small force well entrenched can check the\r\n  frontal attack of a very much larger force, and while holding its\r\n  position can make itself felt over a wider radius than ever before.\r\n  This must needs have a marked effect on strategy, and it is quite\r\n  possible to foresee such an ultimate triumph of field fortification as\r\n  that one force should succeed in surrounding another stronger than\r\n  itself, and by entrenching prevent the latter from breaking out and\r\n  compel its surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn tracing the history of the science of fortification and in outlining\r\nthe practice of our own time it has been necessary to dwell chiefly on\r\nthe material means of defence and attack. The human element has had to\r\nbe almost ignored. But here comes in the paradox, that the material\r\nmeans are after all the least important element of defence. Certainly it\r\nis inconceivable that the designer of a fortress should not try to make\r\nit as strong as is consistent with the object in view and the means at\r\nhis disposal. And yet while engineers in all ages have sought eagerly\r\nfor strength and refinements of strength, the fact remains that the best\r\ndefences recorded in history owed little to the builder's art. The\r\nsplendid defence in 1667 of Candia, whose enceinte, of early Italian\r\ndesign, was already obsolete but whose capture cost the Turks 100,000\r\nmen; the three years defence of Ostend in 1601; the holding of Arcot by\r\nClive, are instances that present themselves to the memory at once. The\r\nvery weight of the odds against them sometimes calls out the best\r\nqualities of the defenders; and the _man_ when at his best is worth many\r\ntimes more than the _rampart_ behind which he fights. But it would be a\r\npoor dependence deliberately to make a place weak in order to evoke\r\nthese qualities. One cannot be sure that the garrison will rise to the\r\noccasion, and the weakness of the place has very often been found an\r\nexcuse for giving it up with little or no resistance.\r\n\r\nVery much depends on the governor. Hence the French saying, \"tant vaut\r\nl'homme, tant vaut la place.\" Among modern men we think of Todleben (not\r\ngovernor, but the soul of the defence) at Sevastopol, Fenwick Williams\r\nat Kars, Denfert-Rochereau at Belfort, and Osman Pasha at Plevna. The\r\nsieges of the 16th and 17th centuries offer many instances in which the\r\nevent turned absolutely on the personal qualities of the governor; in\r\nsome cases distinguished by courage, skill and foresight, in others by\r\nincapacity, cowardice or treachery. The reader is referred to Carnot's\r\n_Defense des places fortes_ for a most interesting summary of such\r\ncases, one or two of which are quoted below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The spirit of the defence.\r\n\r\nNaarden was besieged by the prince of Orange in September 1673 and\r\ndefended by Philippe de Proce, sieur Dupas. The duke of Luxemburg\r\nvisited the place some hours before it was invested, and arranged with\r\nDupas to relieve him as soon as he had collected his cavalry. But the\r\ngovernor lost his head when he saw the enemy encamped round the place,\r\nand surrendered it before he had even lost the covered way. He was\r\nsubsequently tried by a council of war and sentenced to be degraded\r\nbefore the troops and imprisoned for life. The reason the court gave for\r\nnot condemning him to death was that they could find no regulation which\r\ncondemned a man to loss of life for being a coward. (At that period the\r\ndecapitation of a governor who was considered to have failed in his duty\r\nwas not uncommon.) This man, however, was not wanting in physical\r\ncourage. He was in prison at Grave when it was besieged a year later,\r\nobtained leave to serve as a volunteer in the defence, fought well and\r\nwas killed.\r\n\r\nA similar case occurred in the English Civil War. In 1645 the young\r\ngovernor of the royal post at Bletchingdon House was entertaining a\r\nparty of ladies from Oxford, when Cromwell appeared and summoned him to\r\nsurrender. The attacking force had no firearm more powerful than a\r\ncarbine, but the governor, overawed by Cromwell's personality, yielded.\r\nCharles I., who was usually merciful to his officers, caused this\r\ngovernor to be shot.\r\n\r\nA defence of another kind was that of Quilleboeuf in 1592. Henry IV. had\r\noccupied it and ordered it to be fortified. Before the works had been\r\nwell begun, Mayenne sent 5000 men to retake it. Bellegarde undertook its\r\ndefence, with 115 soldiers, 45 gentlemen and a few inhabitants. He had\r\nammunition but not much provisions. With these forces and a line of\r\ndefence a league in length, he sustained a siege, beat off an assault on\r\nthe 17th day, and was relieved immediately afterwards. The relieving\r\nforces were astonished to find that he had been defending not a\r\nfortified town but a village, with a ditch which, in the places where it\r\nhad been begun, measured no more than 4 ft. wide and deep.\r\n\r\nAt that period the business aspect of siege warfare already alluded to\r\nhad been recognized, but many commanders retained the old spirit of\r\nchivalry in their reluctance to say the \"loth word.\" The gallant Marshal\r\nd'Esse, who feared nothing but the idea of dying in his bed, was lying\r\nill at his country house when he was sent for by the king. He was\r\nordered to take command at Therouanne, then threatened by Charles V.,\r\nand made his farewell with these words, which remind us somewhat of\r\nGrenville: \"Sire, je m'y en vais donc de bon et loyal coeur; mais j'ai\r\noui dire que la place est mal envitaillee, non pas seulement pourvue de\r\npalles, de tranches, ni de hottes pour remparer et remuer la terre; mais\r\nlors, quand entendrez que Therouanne est prise, dites hardiment que\r\nd'Esse est gueri de sa jaunisse et mort.\" And he made good his word, for\r\nhe was killed at the breach by a shot from the arquebus of a Spanish\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nSometimes the ardour of defence inspired the whole body of the\r\ninhabitants. Fine examples of this are the defences of Rochelle (1627)\r\nand Saint-Jean de Lone (1636), but these are too long to quote. We may,\r\nhowever, mention Livron, which is curious. In 1574 Henry III. sent one\r\nof his favourites, Saint Lary Bellegarde, against the Huguenots in the\r\nDauphine. Being entrusted with a good army, this gentleman hoped to\r\nachieve some distinction. He began by attacking the little town of\r\nLivron, which had no garrison and was defended only by the inhabitants.\r\nBut he was repulsed in three assaults, and the women of the town\r\nconceived such a contempt for him that they came in crowds to empty\r\ntheir slops at the breach by way of insult. This annoyed him very much,\r\nand he ordered a fresh assault. The women alone sustained this one,\r\nrepulsed it lightheartedly, and the siege was raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arcot.\r\n\r\nThe history of siege warfare has more in it of human interest than any\r\nother branch of military history. It is full of the personal element, of\r\nthe nobility of human endurance and of dramatic surprises. And more than\r\nany battles in the open field, it shows the great results of the courage\r\nof men fighting at bay. Think of Clive at Arcot. With 4 officers, 120\r\nEuropeans and 200 sepoys, with two 18-pounders and 8 lighter guns, he\r\nheld the fort against 150 Europeans and some 10,000 native troops. \"The\r\nfort\" (says Orme) \"seemed little capable of sustaining the impending\r\nsiege. Its extent was more than a mile in circumference. The walls were\r\nin many places ruinous; the rampart too narrow to admit the firing of\r\nartillery; the parapet low and slightly built; several of the towers\r\nwere decayed, and none of them capable of receiving more than one piece\r\nof cannon; the ditch was in most places fordable, in others dry and in\r\nsome choked up,\" &c. These feeble ramparts were commanded almost\r\neverywhere by the enemy's musketry from the houses of the city outside\r\nthe fort, so that the defenders were hardly able to show themselves\r\nwithout being hit, and much loss was suffered in this way. Yet with his\r\ntiny garrison, which timbered about one man for every 7 yds. of the\r\nenclosure, Clive sustained a siege of 50 days, ending with a really\r\nsevere assault on two large open breaches, which was repulsed, and after\r\nwhich the enemy hastily decamped.\r\n\r\nSuch feats as this make arguments about _successive lines of defence_\r\nand the _necessity of keeps_ seem very barren. History, as far as the\r\nwriter knows, shows no instances where successive lines have been held\r\nwith such brilliant results.\r\n\r\nClive's defence of his breaches, which by all the then accepted rules of\r\nwar were untenable, brings us to another point which has been already\r\nmentioned, namely, that a garrison might honourably make terms when\r\nthere was an open breach in their main line of defence. This is a\r\nquestion upon which Carnot delivers himself very strongly in\r\nendeavouring to impress upon French officers the necessity of defence to\r\nthe last moment. Speaking of Cormontaingne's imaginary _Journal of the\r\nAttack of a Fortress_ (which is carried up to the 35th day, and finishes\r\nby the words \"It is now time to surrender\"), he says with great scorn:\r\n\"Crillon would have cried, 'It is time to begin fighting.' He would have\r\nsaid as at the siege of Quilleboeuf, 'Crillon is within, the enemy is\r\nwithout.' Thus when Bayard was defending the shattered walls of\r\nMezieres, M. de Cormontaingne, if he had been there, would have said,\r\n'It is time to surrender.' Thus when Guise was repairing the breaches\r\nof Metz under the redoubled fire of the enemy, M. de Cormontaingne, if\r\nhe had been there, would have said, 'It is time to surrender.'\" Carnot\r\nof course allows that Cormontaingne was personally brave. His scorn is\r\nfor the accepted principle, not for the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Resisting \"to the last.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contrast with this passage some remarks by Sir John\r\nJones, made in answer to Carnot's book. He says in the notes to the\r\nsecond volume of the _Journals of the Sieges in Spain_: \"When the breach\r\nshall be pushed properly forward, if the governor insists upon the\r\nceremony of his last retrenchment being stormed, as by so doing he\r\nspills the blood of many brave men without a justifiable object, his\r\nlife and the lives of the garrison should be made the forfeit. A system\r\nenforced by terror must be counteracted by still greater terror.\r\nHumanity towards an enemy in such a case is cruelty to one's own\r\ntroops.... The principle to be combated is not the obligation to resist\r\nbehind the breach--for where there is a good retrenchment the bastion\r\nshould be disputed equally with the counter-guard or the ravelin and can\r\nas safely be so--but the doctrine that surrender shall not take place\r\nwhen successful resistance becomes hopeless.\"\r\n\r\nCarnot's word is \"fight to the last.\" Sir John Jones says the commander\r\nhas no right to provoke further carnage when resistance is hopeless. The\r\nquestion of course is, When is resistance hopeless? Sir John Jones's\r\nreputation leaves little doubt that if he had been commanding a fortress\r\non British soil he would not have thought resistance hopeless as long as\r\nthere was anything whatever left to defend. The reason why these two men\r\nof similar temper are found in opposition is quite simple. When Carnot\r\nwrote, the French army occupied most of the important fortresses of\r\nEurope, and it was to the interest of the emperor that if attacked they\r\nshould be held to the last moment, in order to cause the enemy as much\r\ndelay and loss as possible. Jones, on the other hand, was one of the\r\nengineers who were engaged in besieging those fortresses, and his\r\narguments were prompted by sympathy for his own countrymen whose lives\r\nwere sacrificed by the prolongation of such resistance.\r\n\r\nA century has passed since Carnot and Jones wrote, and the ideas in\r\nwhich they had been educated were those of the pre-Napoleonic era. In\r\nthe 18th century fortresses were many, good roads few, and campaigns for\r\nthe most part leisurely. To the European nations of that time,\r\ninheritors of a perennial state of war, the idea of concentrating the\r\nnational resources on a short and decisive campaign had not occurred.\r\nThe \"knock-out blow\" had not been invented. All these conditions are now\r\nso changed that new standards must be and indeed have been set up, both\r\nfor the defence of places and the general employment of fortification.\r\n\r\nAs regards the conduct of the defence, the massacre of a garrison as a\r\npenalty for holding out too long would meet with no sympathy in the\r\npresent day. On the other hand, the issue of modern wars is worked out\r\nso rapidly that if a fortress is well defended, with the advantage of\r\nthe present weapons, there is always a chance of holding out till the\r\nclose of the war. If the place is worth holding, it should as a rule be\r\nheld to the bitter end on the chance of a favourable turn in affairs;\r\nmoreover, the maintenance of an important siege under modern conditions\r\nimposes a severe strain on the enemy and immobilizes a large number of\r\nhis troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Permanent defences.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this article some elementary considerations in connexion\r\nwith the use of permanent defences may be noticed, though the general\r\nquestion of strategic fortification is outside its scope. The objects of\r\nfortification differ, as has been shown, from age to age. In former\r\ntimes a peaceful people exposed to the raids of piratical Norsemen might\r\nfind their refuge tower essential; later, a robber-baron might look on\r\nhis castle as so much capital invested; a wealthy medieval town might\r\nprove the value of its walls more than once in a generation; a country\r\nwithout a standing army might gain time for preparation by means of\r\nfortresses barring the roads across the frontier. But how does the\r\nquestion stand to-day among European countries which can mobilize their\r\nfull fighting strength at a few hours' notice? It can only be answered\r\nwhen the circumstances of a particular country are examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The use and abuse of fortresses.\r\n\r\nIf we assume such an impossible case as that of two nations of equal\r\nfighting strength and equal resources standing ready in arms to defend a\r\ncommon frontier, and that the theatre of war presents no difficulties on\r\neither side, then the use of permanent fortifications, merely as an\r\nadjunct to military strength, is wrong. Fortresses do not decide the\r\nissue of a campaign; they can only influence it. It is better,\r\ntherefore, to put all the money the fortress would have cost, and all\r\nthe man-power that its maintenance implies, into the increase and\r\nequipment of the active army. For the fate of the fortress must depend\r\nultimately on the result of the operations of the active armies.\r\nMoreover, the very assumption that resources on both sides are equal\r\nmeans that the nation which has spent money on permanent fortifications\r\nwill have the smaller active army, and therefore condemns itself\r\nbeforehand to a defensive role.\r\n\r\nThis general negation is only useful as a corrective to the tendency to\r\nover-fortify, for such a case cannot occur. In practice there will\r\nalways be occasion for some use of fortification. A mountain range may\r\nlend itself to an economical defence by a few men and some inexpensive\r\nbarrier forts. A nation may have close to its frontier an important\r\nstrategic centre, such as a railway junction, or a town of the first\r\nmanufacturing importance, which must be protected. In such a case it may\r\nbe necessary to guard against accidents by means of a fortress. Again,\r\nif one nation is admittedly slower in mobilization than the other, it\r\nmay be desirable to guard one portion of the frontier by fortresses so\r\nas to force invasion into a district where concentration against it is\r\neasiest.\r\n\r\nAs for the defence of a capital, this cannot become necessary if it\r\nstands at a reasonable distance from the frontier until the active\r\narmies have arrived at some result. If the fighting strength of the\r\ncountry has been practically destroyed, it is not of much use to stand a\r\nsiege in the capital. There can be but one end, and it is better, as\r\nbusiness men say, to cut losses. If the fighting strength is not\r\nentirely destroyed and can be recruited within a reasonable time, say\r\ntwo or three months, then it appears that under modern conditions the\r\ncapital might be held for that time by means of extemporized defences.\r\nThe question is one that can only be decided by going into the\r\ncircumstances of each particular case.\r\n\r\nThe case of a weak country with powerful and aggressive neighbours is in\r\na different category. If she stands alone she will be eaten up in time,\r\nfortifications or no fortifications; but if she can reckon on assistance\r\nfrom outside, it may be worth while to expend most of the national\r\nresources on permanent defences.\r\n\r\nThese hypothetical cases have, however, no value, except as\r\nillustrations to the most elementary arguments. The actual problems that\r\nsoldiers and statesmen have to consider are too complex to be dealt with\r\nin generalities, and no mere treatise can supply the place of knowledge,\r\nthought and practice.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The more important works on the subject are: Durer,\r\n  _Unterricht zur Befestigung_ (Nuremberg, 1527); Speckle, _Architectur\r\n  von Festungen_ (Strassburg, 1589); Fritach, _L'Architecture mil. ou la\r\n  f. nouvelle_ (Paris, 1637); Pagan, _Les Fortif._ (Paris, 1689); de\r\n  Ville, _Les Fortif._ (Lyons, 1629); de Fer, _Introduction a la\r\n  fortification_ (Paris, 1723); B.F. de Belidor, _Science des\r\n  Ingenieurs, &c._ (Paris, 1729); works of Coehoorn, Vauban,\r\n  Montalembert, Cormontaingne; Mandar, _De l'architecture des\r\n  forteresses_ (Paris, 1801); Chasseloup-Laubat, _Essais sur quelques\r\n  parties de l'artil. et de la fortification_ (Milan, 1811); Carnot,\r\n  _Defense des places fortes_ (Paris, 1812); Jones, _Journals of Sieges\r\n  in Spain_ (3rd ed., London, 1846); T.

The fundamental idea of his psychology is impulse, which\r\ncombines representation (which presupposes consciousness) and feeling\r\n(i.e. pleasure). Reason is the highest thing in nature, i.e. is divine\r\nin its nature, God is the absolute Ego and the empirical egos are his\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n  Fortlage's chief works are: _Genetische Geschichte d. Philos. seit\r\n  Kant_ (Leipzig, 1852); _System d. Psych, als empirische Wissenschaft_\r\n  (2 vols., Leipzig, 1855); _Darstellung und Kritik der Beweise fur das\r\n  Dasein Gottes_ (Heidelberg, 1840); _Beitrage zur Psych. als\r\n  Wissenschaft_ (Leipzig, 1875).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT LEE, a borough of Bergen county, New Jersey, U.S.A., in the N.E.\r\npart of the state, on the W. bank of the Hudson river, opposite the\r\nnorthern part of New York City. Pop. (1905) 3433; (1910) 4472. It is\r\nconnected with the neighbouring towns and cities by electric railways,\r\nand by ferry with New York City, of which it is a residential suburb.\r\nThe main part of the borough lies along the summit of the Palisades;\r\nnorth of Fort Lee is an Interstate Palisades Park. Early in the War of\r\nIndependence the Americans erected here a fortification, first called\r\nFort Constitution but later renamed Fort Lee, in honour of General\r\nCharles Lee. The name of the fort was subsequently applied to the\r\nvillage that grew up in its vicinity. From the 15th of September until\r\nthe 20th of November 1776 Fort Lee was held by Gen. Nathanael Greene\r\nwith a garrison of 3500 men, but the capture by the British of Fort\r\nWashington on the opposite bank of the river and the crossing of the\r\nHudson by Lord Cornwallis with 5000 men made it necessary for Greene to\r\nabandon this post and join Washington in the famous \"retreat across the\r\nJerseys.\" An attempt to recapture Fort Lee was made by General Anthony\r\nWayne in 1780, but was unsuccessful. On the site of the fort a monument,\r\ndesigned by Carl E. Tefft and consisting of heroic figures of a\r\nContinental trooper and drummer boy, was erected in 1908. The borough of\r\nFort Lee was incorporated in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT MADISON, a city and the county-seat of Lee county, Iowa, U.S.A., on\r\nthe Mississippi river, in the S.E. corner of the state, and about 20 m.\r\nS.W. of Burlington. Pop. (1890) 7901; (1900) 9278, of whom 1025 were\r\nforeign-born; (1905) 8767; (1910) 8900. Fort Madison is served by the\r\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe (which has repair shops here) and the\r\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy railways. The city has various\r\nmanufactures, including canned goods, chairs, paper and farm implements;\r\nthe value of its factory product in 1905 was $2,378,892, an increase of\r\n50.8% over that of 1900. Fort Madison is the seat of one of Iowa's\r\npenitentiaries. A stockade fort was erected on the site of the city in\r\n1808, but was burned in 1813. Permanently settled in 1833, Fort Madison\r\nwas laid out as a town in 1836, and was chartered as a city in 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTROSE (Gaelic for _t'rois_, \"the wood on the promontory\"), a royal\r\nand police burgh, and seaport of the county of Ross and Cromarty,\r\nScotland. Pop. (1901) 1179. It is situated on the south-eastern coast of\r\nthe peninsula of the Black Isle, 8 m. due N.N.E. of Inverness, 26-1/4 m.\r\nby rail. It is the terminus of the Black Isle branch of the Highland\r\nrailway; there is communication by steamer with Inverness and also with\r\nFort George, 2-1/2 m. distant, by ferry from Chanonry Ness. Fortrose\r\nconsists of the two towns of Rosemarkie and Chanonry, about 1 m. apart,\r\nwhich were united into a free burgh by James II. in 1455 and created a\r\nroyal burgh in 1590. It is a place of considerable antiquity, a\r\nmonastery having been established in the 6th century by St Moluag, a\r\nfriend of Columba's, and St Peter's church built in the 8th century. In\r\n1124 David I. instituted the bishopric of Ross, with its seat here, and\r\nthe town acquired some fame for its school of theology and law. The\r\ncathedral is believed to have been founded in 1330 by the countess of\r\nRoss (her canopied tomb, against the chancel wall, still exists) and\r\nfinished in 1485 by Abbot Fraser, whose previous residence at Melrose is\r\nsaid to account for the Perpendicular features of his portion of the\r\nwork. It was Early Decorated in style, cruciform in plan, and built of\r\nred sandstone, but all that is left are the south aisles of the nave and\r\nthe chancel, with the chapter-house, a two-storeyed structure, standing\r\napart near the north-eastern corner. The cathedral and bishop's palace\r\nwere destroyed by order of Cromwell, who used the stones for his great\r\nfort at Inverness. Another relic of the past survives in the bell of\r\n1460. These ruins form the chief object of interest in the town, but\r\nother buildings include the academy and the Black Isle combination\r\npoorhouse. The town is an agricultural centre of some consequence, and\r\nthe harbour is kept in repair. Rosemarkie, in the churchyard of which is\r\nan ancient Celtic cross, is much resorted to for sea-bathing, and there\r\nis a golf course in Chanonry Ness. The burgh belongs to the Inverness\r\ndistrict group of parliamentary burghs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT SCOTT, a city and the county-seat of Bourbon county, Kansas,\r\nU.S.A., on the Marmaton river, about 100 m. S. of Kansas City, Missouri.\r\nPop. (1880) 5372; (1890) 11,946; (1900) 10,322, of whom 1205 were\r\nnegroes; (1910 census) 10,463. It is the point of intersection of the\r\nKansas City, Fort Scott & Memphis (St Louis & San Francisco system), the\r\nMissouri, Kansas & Texas, and the Missouri Pacific railways, and has in\r\nconsequence a large traffic. The city is built on a rolling plain. Among\r\nits institutions are an Epworth house (1899), Mercy hospital (1889), the\r\nGoodlander home, and a Carnegie library. Near the city there is a\r\nnational cemetery. Fort Scott is in the midst of the Kansas mineral\r\nfields, and its trade in bituminous coal is especially important.\r\nBuilding stones, cement rock, clays, oil and gas, lead and zinc are also\r\nfound in the neighbourhood. An excellent white sulphur water is procured\r\nfrom artesian wells about 800 ft. deep, and there is a mineral-water\r\nbath house. The city is also a trading centre for a rich farming region,\r\nand is a horse and mule market of considerable importance. Among its\r\nmanufactures are mattresses, syrup, bricks, pottery, cement and foundry\r\nproducts. In 1905 the total value of the city's factory product was\r\n$1,349,026, being an increase of 89% since 1900. The city owns and\r\noperates its waterworks. The fort after which the city is named was\r\nestablished by the Federal government in 1842, at a time when the whole\r\nof eastern Kansas was still parcelled out among Indian tribes; it was\r\nabandoned in 1855. The town was platted in 1857, and Fort Scott was\r\nchartered as a city in 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT SMITH, a city and the county-seat of Sebastian county, on the\r\nextreme W. border of Arkansas, U.S.A., lying about 440 ft. above\r\nsea-level, on the S. bank of the Arkansas river, at its junction with\r\nthe Poteau, and at the point where the Arkansas breaks through the\r\nBoston mountains. Pop. (1890) 11,311; (1900) 11,587, of whom 2407 were\r\nof negro descent and 684 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 23,975.\r\nTransportation is afforded by the river and by six railways, the St\r\nLouis & San Francisco, the St Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern, the\r\nArkansas Central, the Fort Smith & Western, the Midland Valley and the\r\nKansas City Southern. A belt line round the business centre of the city\r\nfacilitates freight transfers. Some of the business streets are\r\nunusually broad, and the streets in the residential district are well\r\nshaded. Fort Smith is the business centre of a fine agricultural country\r\nand of the Arkansas coal and natural gas region. It has extensive\r\nwholesale jobbing interests and a large miscellaneous trade, partly in\r\nits own manufactures, among which are cotton and timber products,\r\nchairs, mattresses and other furniture, wagons, brooms and bricks. In\r\n1905 the total value of the factory product was $2,329,454, an increase\r\nof 66.2% since 1900. The public schools have a rich endowment: the\r\nproceeds of lands (about 200 acres) once belonging to the local\r\nmilitary reservation, which--except the part occupied by a national\r\ncemetery--was given by Congress to the city in 1884. Near the centre of\r\nthe city are a Catholic academy, convent and infirmary; and there is a\r\nCarnegie library. A United States army post was established here in\r\n1817; the town was laid out in 1821; and the county was created in 1851.\r\nFort Smith was incorporated as a town in 1842, and was chartered as a\r\ncity in 1845. All transportation was by river and wagon until 1876, when\r\nthe railway was completed from Little Rock. The military post, in\r\nearlier years the chief depot for the western forts, was abandoned in\r\n1871. During the Civil War Fort Smith was strongly in sympathy with the\r\nConfederacy. The fort was seized by state troops in April 1861, and was\r\nreoccupied by the Union forces in September 1863. There was considerable\r\nunrest due to border \"bushwhacking\" throughout the war, and several\r\nskirmishes took place here in 1864. The area of the city was more than\r\ndoubled in 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNA (FORTUNE), an Italian goddess of great antiquity, but apparently\r\nnot native at Rome, where, according to universal Roman tradition, she\r\nwas introduced by the king Servius Tullius as Fors Fortuna, and\r\nestablished in a temple on the Etruscan side of the Tiber outside the\r\ncity, and also under other titles in other shrines. In Latium she had\r\ntwo famous places of worship, one at Praeneste, where there was an\r\noracle of _Fortuna primigenia_ (the first-born), frequented especially\r\nby women who, as we may suppose, desired to know the fortunes of their\r\nchildren or their own fortune in child-birth; the other at Antium, well\r\nknown from Horace's ode (i. 35). It is highly probable that Fortuna was\r\nnever a deity of the abstract idea of chance, but represented the hopes\r\nand fears of men and especially of women at different stages of their\r\nlife and experience; thus we find her worshipped as time went on under\r\nnumerous cult-titles, such as _muliebris_, _virilis_, _hujusce diei_,\r\n_equestris_, _redux_, &c., which connected her supposed powers with\r\nindividuals, groups of individuals, or particular occasions. Gradually\r\nshe became more or less closely identified with the Gr. [Greek: Tyche],\r\nand was represented on coins, &c., with a cornucopia as the giver of\r\nprosperity, a rudder as the controller of destinies, and with a wheel,\r\nor standing on a ball, to indicate the uncertainty of fortune. In this\r\nsemi-Greek form she came to be worshipped over the whole empire, and\r\nPliny (_N.H._ ii. 22) declares that in his day she was invoked in all\r\nplaces and every hour. She even became identified with Isis, and as\r\n_Panthea_ was supposed to combine the attributes of all other deities.\r\n\r\n  The best account of this difficult subject is to be found in Roscher's\r\n  _Mythological Lexicon_ (s.v.); see also Wissowa, _Religion und Kultus\r\n  der Romer_, p. 206 foll.     (W. W. F.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNATIANUS, ATILIUS, Latin grammarian, flourished in the 4th century\r\nA.D. He was the author of a treatise on metres, dedicated to one of his\r\npupils, a youth of senatorial rank, who desired to be instructed in the\r\nHoratian metres. The manual opens with a discussion of the fundamental\r\nideas of metre and the chief rules of prosody, and ends with a detailed\r\nanalysis of the metres of Horace. The chief authorities used are Caesius\r\nBassus and the Latin adaptation by Juba the grammarian of the [Greek:\r\nTechne] of Heliodorus. Fortunatianus being a common name in the African\r\nprovinces, it is probable that the author was a countryman of Juba,\r\nTerentianus Maurus and Victorinus.\r\n\r\n  Editions of the _Ars_ in H. Keil, _Grammatici Latini_, vi., and\r\n  separately by him (1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNATUS, the legendary hero of a popular European chap-book. He was a\r\nnative, says the story, of Famagusta in Cyprus, and meeting the goddess\r\nof Fortune in a forest received from her a purse which was continually\r\nreplenished as often as he drew from it. With this he wandered through\r\nmany lands, and at Cairo was the guest of the sultan. Among the\r\ntreasures which the sultan showed him was an old napless hat which had\r\nthe power of transporting its wearer to any place he desired. Of this\r\nhat he feloniously possessed himself, and returned to Cyprus, where he\r\nled a luxurious life. On his death he left the purse and the hat to his\r\nsons Ampedo and Andelosia; but they were jealous of each other, and by\r\ntheir recklessness and folly soon fell on evil days. The moral of the\r\nstory is obvious: men should desire reason and wisdom before all the\r\ntreasures of the world. In its full form the history of Fortunatus\r\noccupies in Karl Simrock's _Die deutschen Volksbucher_, vol. iii.,\r\nupwards of 158 pages. The scene is continually shifted--from Cyprus to\r\nFlanders, from Flanders to London, from London to France; and a large\r\nnumber of secondary characters appear. The style and allusions indicate\r\na comparatively modern date for the authorship; but the nucleus of the\r\nlegend can be traced back to a much earlier period. The stories of\r\nJonathas and the three jewels in the _Gesta Romanorum_, of the emperor\r\nFrederick and the three precious stones in the _Cento Novelle antiche_,\r\nof the Mazin of Khorassan in the _Thousand and one Nights_, and the\r\nflying scaffold in the _Bahar Danush_, have all a certain similarity.\r\nThe earliest known edition of the German text of Fortunatus appeared at\r\nAugsburg in 1509, and the modern German investigators are disposed to\r\nregard this as the original form. Innumerable versions occur in French,\r\nItalian, Dutch and English. The story was dramatized by Hans Sachs in\r\n1553, and by Thomas Dekker in 1600; and the latter's comedy appeared in\r\na German translation in _Englische Komodien und Tragodien_, 1620. Ludwig\r\nTieck has utilized the legend in his _Phantasus_, and Adelbert von\r\nChamisso in his _Peter Schlemihl_; and Ludwig Uhland left an unfinished\r\nnarrative poem entitled \"Fortunatus and his Sons.\"\r\n\r\n  See Dr Fr. W.V. Schmidt's _Fortunatus und seine Sohne, eine\r\n  Zauber-Tragodie, von Thomas Decker, mit einem Anhang_, &c. (Berlin,\r\n  1819); Joseph Johann Gorres, _Die deutschen Volksbucher_ (1807).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNATUS, VENANTIUS HONORIUS CLEMENTIANUS (530-609), bishop of\r\nPoitiers, and the chief Latin poet of his time, was born near Ceneda in\r\nTreviso in 530. He studied at Milan and Ravenna, with the special object\r\nof excelling as a rhetorician and poet, and in 565 he journeyed to\r\nFrance, where he was received with much favour at the court of Sigbert,\r\nking of Austrasia, whose marriage with Brunhild he celebrated in an\r\n_epithalamium_. After remaining a year or two at the court of Sigbert he\r\ntravelled in various parts of France, visiting persons of distinction,\r\nand composing short pieces of poetry on any subject that occurred to\r\nhim. At Poitiers he visited Queen Radegunda, who lived there in\r\nretirement, and she induced him to prolong his stay in the city\r\nindefinitely. Here he also enjoyed the friendship of the famous Gregory\r\nof Tours and other eminent ecclesiastics. He was elected bishop of\r\nPoitiers in 599, and died about 609. The later poems of Fortunatus were\r\ncollected in 11 books, and consist of hymns (including the _Vexilla\r\nregis prodeunt_, Englished by J.M. Neale as \"The royal banners forward\r\ngo\"), epitaphs, poetical epistles, and verses in honour of his patroness\r\nRadegunda and her sister Agnes, the abbess of a nunnery at Poitiers. He\r\nalso wrote a large poem in 4 books in honour of St Martin, and several\r\nlives of the saints in prose. His prose is stiff and mechanical, but\r\nmost of his poetry has an easy rhythmical flow.\r\n\r\n  An edition of the works of Fortunatus was published by C. Brower at\r\n  Fulda in 1603 (2nd ed., Mainz, 1617). The edition of M.A. Luschi\r\n  (Rome, 1785) was afterwards reprinted in Migne's _Patrologiae cursus\r\n  completus_, vol. lxxxviii. See the edition by Leo and Krusch (Berlin,\r\n  1881-1885). There are French lives by Nisard (1880) and Leroux (1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNE, ROBERT (1813-1880), Scottish botanist and traveller, was born\r\nat Kelloe in Berwickshire on the 16th of September 1813. He was employed\r\nin the botanical garden at Edinburgh, and afterwards in the Royal\r\nHorticultural Society's garden at Chiswick, and upon the termination of\r\nthe Chinese War in 1842 was sent out by the Society to collect plants in\r\nChina. His travels resulted in the introduction to Europe of many\r\nbeautiful flowers; but another journey, undertaken in 1848 on behalf of\r\nthe East India Company, had much more important consequences,\r\noccasioning the successful introduction into India of the tea-plant. In\r\nsubsequent journeys he visited Formosa and Japan, described the culture\r\nof the silkworm and the manufacture of rice paper, and introduced many\r\ntrees, shrubs and flowers now generally cultivated in Europe. The\r\nincidents of his travels were related in a succession of interesting\r\nbooks. He died in London on the 13th of April 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNY, MARIANO JOSE MARIA BERNARDO (1838-1874), Spanish painter, was\r\nborn at Reus on the 11th of June 1838. His parents, who were in poor\r\ncircumstances, sent him for education to the primary school of his\r\nnative town, where he received some instruction in the rudiments of art.\r\nWhen he was twelve years old his parents died and he came under the care\r\nof his grandfather, who, though a joiner by trade, had made a collection\r\nof wax figures, with which he was travelling from town to town. In the\r\nworking of this show the boy took an active part, modelling and painting\r\nmany of the figures; and two years later, when he reached Barcelona, the\r\ncleverness of his handiwork made so much impression on some people in\r\nauthority there that they induced the municipality to make him an\r\nallowance of forty-two francs monthly, so that he might be enabled to go\r\nthrough a systematic course of study. He entered the Academy of\r\nBarcelona and worked there for four years under Claudio Lorenzale, and\r\nin March 1857 he gained a scholarship that entitled him to complete his\r\nstudies in Rome. Then followed a period of more than two years, during\r\nwhich he laboured steadily at copies of the old pictures to which he had\r\naccess at Rome. To this period an end was put by the outbreak of the war\r\nbetween Spain and the emperor of Morocco, as Fortuny was sent by the\r\nauthorities of Barcelona to paint the most striking incidents of the\r\ncampaign. The expedition lasted for about six months only, but it made\r\nupon him an impression that was powerful enough to affect the whole\r\ncourse of his subsequent development, and to implant permanently in his\r\nmind a preference for the glitter and brilliancy of African colour. He\r\nreturned to Spain in the summer of 1860, and was commissioned by the\r\ncity of Barcelona to paint a large picture of the capture of the camps\r\nof Muley-el-Abbas and Muley-el-Hamed by the Spanish army. After making a\r\nlarge number of studies he went back to Rome, and began the composition\r\non a canvas fifteen metres long; but though it occupied much of his time\r\nduring the next few years, he never finished it. He busied himself\r\ninstead with a wonderful series of pictures, mostly of no great size, in\r\nwhich he showed an astonishing command over vivacities of technique and\r\nmodulations of colour. He visited Paris in 1868 and shortly afterwards\r\nmarried the daughter of Federico Madrazo, the director of the royal\r\nmuseum at Madrid. Another visit to Paris in 1870 was followed by a two\r\nyears' stay at Granada, but then he returned to Rome, where he died\r\nsomewhat suddenly on the 21st of November 1874 from an attack of\r\nmalarial fever, contracted while painting in the open air at Naples and\r\nPortici in the summer of 1874.\r\n\r\nThe work which Fortuny accomplished during his short life is\r\ndistinguished by a superlative facility of execution and a marvellous\r\ncleverness in the arrangement of brilliant hues, but the qualities of\r\nhis art are those that are attainable by a master of technical resource\r\nrather than by a deep thinker. His insight into subtleties of\r\nillumination was extraordinary, his dexterity was remarkable in the\r\nextreme, and as a colourist he was vivacious to the point of\r\nextravagance. At the same time in such pictures as \"La Vicaria\" and\r\n\"Choosing a Model,\" and in some of his Moorish subjects, like \"The Snake\r\nCharmers\" and \"Moors playing with a Vulture,\" he showed himself to be\r\nendowed with a sensitive appreciation of shades of character and a\r\nthorough understanding of the peculiarities of a national type. His love\r\nof detail was instinctive, and he chose motives that gave him the\r\nfullest opportunity of displaying his readiness as a craftsman.\r\n\r\n  See Davillier, _Fortuny, sa vie, son oeuvre, sa correspondance, &c._\r\n  (Paris, 1876); C. Yriarte, _Fortuny_ (_Artistes celebres_ series)\r\n  (Paris, 1889).     (A. L. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WAYNE, a city and the county-seat of Allen county, Indiana, U.S.A.,\r\n102 m. N.E. of Indianapolis, at the point where the St Joseph and St\r\nMary's rivers join to form the Maumee river. Pop. (1880) 26,880; (1890)\r\n35,393; (1900) 45,115, of whom 6791 were foreign-born; (1910, census)\r\n63,933. It is served by the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton, the Fort\r\nWayne, Cincinnati & Louisville, the Grand Rapids & Indiana, the Lake\r\nShore & Michigan Southern, the New York, Chicago & St Louis, the\r\nPennsylvania and the Wabash railways, and also by interurban electric\r\nlines. The site of the city is high (about 770 ft. above sea-level) and\r\nlevel, and its land area was in 1906 a little more than 6 sq. m. The\r\nstreets are laid out on a rectangular plan and bordered by a profusion\r\nof shade trees. The city has several parks, including Lawton Park (31\r\nacres), in which there is a monument in honour of Major-General Henry\r\nWare Lawton (1843-1899), who lived in Fort Wayne for a time, Lake Side\r\nPark (22 acres), Reservoir Park (13 acres), Piqua Park (1 acre), and Old\r\nFort Park (1/4 acre), which is on the site of Old Fort Wayne. The\r\neducational institutions include the German Concordia Collegium\r\n(Lutheran), founded in 1839, and having 220 students in 1908, and the\r\nstate school for feeble-minded youth (1879). The city has a Carnegie\r\nlibrary. Fort Wayne is one of the most important railway centres in the\r\nMiddle West, and several railways maintain here their principal car and\r\nrepair shops, which add greatly to the value of its manufacturing\r\nindustries; in 1905 it ranked first among the cities of the state in the\r\nvalue of cars constructed and repaired by steam-railway companies. The\r\nother manufactories include foundries and machine shops, iron and steel\r\nmills, knitting mills, planing mills, sash and door, car-wheel,\r\nelectrical machinery, and woodenware factories and flour mills. In 1905\r\nthe total value of the factory product of the city was $15,129,562,\r\nshowing an increase of 34.3% since 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Miami Indians had several villages in the immediate neighbourhood,\r\nand the principal one, Kekionaga (Miami Town or Great Miami Village),\r\nwas situated on the E. bank of the St Joseph river, within the limits of\r\nthe present city. On the E. bank of the St Mary's a French trading post\r\nwas built about 1680. In 1749-1750 the French fort (Fort Miami) was\r\nmoved to the E. bank of the St Joseph. The English occupied the fort in\r\n1760 and Pontiac captured it in May 1763, after a siege of more than\r\nthree months. In 1790 the Miami villages were destroyed. In September\r\n1794 General Anthony Wayne built on the S. bank of the Maumee river the\r\nstockade fort which was named in his honour, the site of which forms the\r\npresent Old Fort Park. By the treaty of Greenville, concluded by General\r\nWayne on the 3rd of August 1795, a piece of land 6 sq. m. in area,\r\nincluding the tract of the Miami towns, was ceded to the United States,\r\nand free passage to Fort Wayne and down the Maumee to Lake Erie was\r\nguaranteed to the people of the United States by the Indians. By the\r\ntreaty of Fort Wayne, concluded by General W.H. Harrison on the 7th of\r\nJune 1803, the tract about Vincennes reserved to the United States by\r\nthe treaty of Greenville was described and defined; by the second treaty\r\nof Fort Wayne, concluded by Harrison on the 30th of September 1809, the\r\nIndians sold to the United States about 2,900,000 acres of land, mostly\r\nS.E. of the Wabash river. In September 1813 Fort Wayne was besieged by\r\nIndians, who withdrew on the arrival, on the 12th of September, of\r\nGeneral Harrison with about 2700 men from Kentucky and Ohio. The fort\r\nwas abandoned on the 19th of April 1819 and no trace of it remains. The\r\nfirst permanent settlement here was made in 1815, and the village was an\r\nimportant fur-trading depot until 1830. The opening of the Wabash & Erie\r\ncanal in 1843 stimulated its growth. A town was platted and was made the\r\ncounty-seat in 1824; and in 1840 Fort Wayne was chartered as a city.\r\n\r\n  See W.A. Brice, _History of Fort Wayne_ (Ft. Wayne, 1868); John B.\r\n  Dillon, _History of Indiana, from its Earliest Exploration by\r\n  Europeans to the Close of the Territorial Government in 1816_\r\n  (Indianapolis, Ind., 1859); and Charles E. Slocum, _History of the\r\n  Maumee River Basin, from the Earliest Accounts to its Organization\r\n  into Counties_ (Defiance, Ohio, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WILLIAM, the principal town of Thunder Bay district, Ontario,\r\nCanada, 426 m. (by rail) E.S.E. of Winnipeg, on the Kaministiquia river,\r\nabout a mile from Lake Superior. It is the lake terminus of the Canadian\r\nPacific railway, of the new Grand Trunk Pacific railway, and of several\r\nsteamship lines. Port Arthur, the terminus of the Canadian Northern\r\nrailway, lies 4 m. to the N.E. Fort William contains numerous grain\r\nelevators, railway repair shops and docks, and has a large export trade\r\nin grain and other farm produce. Minerals are also exported from the\r\nmining district, of which it is the centre. Industries, such as saw,\r\nplaning and flour mills, have also sprung up. The population was 4800 in\r\n1901, but has since increased with great rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WILLIAM, a police burgh of Inverness-shire, Scotland. Pop. (1901)\r\n2087. It lies at the north-eastern end of Loch Linnhe, an arm of the\r\nsea, about 62 m. S.S.W. of Inverness by road or canal, and was, in\r\nbygone days, one of the keys of the Highlands. It is 122-1/2 m. N.E. of\r\nGlasgow by the West Highland railway. The fort, at first called\r\nKilmallie, was built by General Monk in 1655 to hold the Cameron men in\r\nsubjection, and was enlarged in 1690 by General Hugh Mackay, who renamed\r\nit after William III., the burgh then being known as Maryburgh in honour\r\nof his queen. Here the perpetrators of the massacre of Glencoe met to\r\nshare their plunder. The Jacobites unsuccessfully besieged it in 1715\r\nand 1746. The fort was dismantled in 1860, and demolished in 1890 to\r\nprovide room for the railway and the station. Amongst the public\r\nbuildings are the Belford hospital, public hall, court house and the\r\nlow-level meteorological observatory, constructed in 1891, which was in\r\nconnexion with the observatory on the top of Ben Nevis, until the latter\r\nwas closed in 1904. Its great industry is distilling, and the\r\ndistilleries, about 2 m. N.E., are a familiar feature in the landscape.\r\nBeyond the railway station stands the obelisk to the memory of Ewen\r\nMaclachlan (1775-1822), the Gaelic poet, who was born in the parish.\r\nFort William is a popular tourist resort and place of call for the\r\nsteamers passing through the Caledonian canal. The town is the point\r\nfrom which the ascent of Ben Nevis--4-1/2 m. E.S.E. as the crow flies--is\r\ncommonly made. At Corpach, about 2 m. N., the Caledonian canal begins,\r\nthe series of locks between here and Banavie--within little more than a\r\nmile--being known as \"Neptune's Staircase.\" Both the Lochy and the Nevis\r\nenter Loch Linnhe immediately to the north of Fort William. A mile and a\r\nhalf from the town, on the Lochy, stands the grand old ruin of\r\nInverlochy Castle, a massive quadrangular pile with a round tower at\r\neach corner, a favourite subject with landscape painters. Close by is\r\nthe scene of the battle of the 2nd of February 1645, in which Montrose\r\ncompletely defeated the earl of Argyll. The modern castle, in the\r\nScottish Baronial style, 1-1/2 m. to the N.E. of this stronghold and\r\nfarther from the river, is the seat of Lord Abinger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WORTH, a city and the county-seat of Tarrant county, Texas, U.S.A.,\r\nabout 30 m. W. of Dallas, on the S. bank of the West Fork of the Trinity\r\nriver. Pop. (1880) 6663; (1890) 23,076; (1900) 26,688, of whom 1793 were\r\nforeign-born and 4249 were negroes; (1910, census) 73,312. It is served\r\nby the Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf, the Fort Worth & Denver City, the\r\nFort Worth & Rio Grande, and the St Louis, San Francisco & Texas of the\r\n\"Frisco\" system, the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe, the Houston & Texas\r\nCentral, the International & Great Northern, the Missouri, Kansas &\r\nTexas, the St Louis South-Western, the Texas & Pacific, and the Trinity\r\n& Brazos Valley (Colorado & Southern) railways. Fort Worth is\r\nbeautifully situated on a level space above the river. It is the seat of\r\nFort Worth University (coeducational), a Methodist Episcopal\r\ninstitution, which was established as the Texas Wesleyan College in\r\n1881, received its present name in 1889, comprises an academy, a college\r\nof liberal arts and sciences, a conservatory of music, a law school, a\r\nmedical school, a school of commerce, and a department of oratory and\r\nelocution, and in 1907 had 802 students; the Polytechnic College\r\n(coeducational; Methodist Episcopal, South), which was established in\r\n1890, has preparatory, collegiate, normal, commercial, and fine arts\r\ndepartments and a summer school, and in 1906 had 12 instructors and\r\n(altogether) 696 students; the Texas masonic manual training school; a\r\nkindergarten training school; St Andrews school (Protestant Episcopal),\r\nand St Ignatius Academy (Roman Catholic). There are several good\r\nbusiness, municipal and county buildings, and a Carnegie library. On the\r\n3rd of April 1909 a fire destroyed ten blocks in the centre of the city.\r\nFort Worth lies in the midst of a stock-raising and fertile\r\nagricultural region; there is an important stockyard and packing\r\nestablishment just outside the city; and considerable quantities of\r\ncotton are raised in the vicinity. Among the products are packed meats,\r\nflour, beer, trunks, crackers, candy, paint, ice, paste, cigars,\r\nclothing, shoes, mattresses, woven wire beds, furniture and overalls;\r\nand there are foundries, iron rolling mills and tanneries. In 1905 the\r\ntotal value of the city's factory product was $5,668,391, an increase of\r\n62.5% since 1900; Fort Worth in 1900 ranked fifth among the cities of\r\nthe state in the value of its factory product; in 1905 it ranked fourth.\r\nFort Worth's numerous railways have given it great importance as a\r\ncommercial centre. The municipality owns and operates the waterworks and\r\nthe electric-lighting plant.\r\n\r\nA military post was established here in 1849, being called first Camp\r\nWorth and then Fort Worth. It was abandoned in 1853. A settlement grew\r\nup about the fort, and the city was incorporated in 1873. The fort and\r\nthe settlement were named in honour of General William Jenkins Worth\r\n(1794-1849), a native of Hudson, New York, who served in the War of\r\n1812, commanded the United States forces against the Seminole Indians in\r\n1841-1842, served under both General Taylor and General Scott in the\r\nMexican War, distinguishing himself at Monterey (where he earned the\r\nbrevet of major-general) and in other engagements, and later commanded\r\nthe department of Texas. In 1907 Fort Worth adopted a commission form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTY, the cardinal number equal to four tens. The word is derived from\r\nthe O. Eng. _feowertig_, a combination of _feower_, four, and _tig_, an\r\nold form of \"ten,\" used as a suffix, cf. Icel. _tiu_, Dan. _ti_, ten,\r\nand Ger. _vierzig_, forty. The name \"The Forty\" has been given to\r\nvarious bodies composed of that number of members, particularly to a\r\njudicial body in ancient Athens, who tried small cases in the rural\r\ndistricts, and to a court of criminal jurisdiction and two civil appeal\r\ncourts in the Venetian republic. The French Academy (see ACADEMIES) has\r\nalso been known as \"The Forty\" or \"The Forty Immortals.\" The period just\r\nbefore the repeal of the corn laws in the United Kingdom is frequently\r\nalluded to, particularly by the free trade school, as the \"hungry\r\nforties\"; and the \"roaring forties\" is a sailor's name for the stormy\r\nregion between the 40th and 50th latitudes N. and S., but more\r\nparticularly applied to the portion of the north Atlantic lying between\r\nthose latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORUM (Lat. from _foris_, \"out of doors\"), in Roman antiquity, any open\r\nplace used, like the Greek [Greek: agora], for the transaction of\r\nmercantile, judicial or political business, sometimes merely as a\r\npromenade. It was level, rectangular in form, surrounded by porticoes,\r\nbasilicas, courts of law and other public buildings. In the laws of the\r\nTwelve Tables the word is used of the vestibule of a tomb (Cicero, _De\r\nlegibus_, ii. 24); in a Roman camp the forum was an open place\r\nimmediately beside the praetorium; and the term was no doubt originally\r\napplied generally to the space in front of any public building or\r\ngateway. In Rome (q.v.) itself, however, during the period of the early\r\nhistory, forum was almost a proper name, denoting the flat and formerly\r\nmarshy space between the Palatine and Capitoline hills (also called\r\nForum Romanum), which probably even during the regal period afforded the\r\naccommodation necessary for such public meetings as could not be held\r\nwithin the area Capitolina. In early times the Forum Romanum was used\r\nfor athletic games, and over the porticoes were galleries for\r\nspectators; there were also shops of various kinds. But with the growth\r\nof the city and the increase of provincial business, more than one forum\r\nbecame necessary, and under the empire a considerable number of\r\n_civilia_ (judicial) and _venalia_ (mercantile) fora came into\r\nexistence. In addition to the Forum Romanum, the Fora of Caesar and\r\nAugustus belonged to the former class; the Forum _boarium_ (cattle),\r\n_holitorium_ (vegetable), _piscarium_ (fish), _pistorium_ (bread),\r\n_vinarium_ (wine), to the latter. The Fora of Nerva (also called\r\n_transitorium_ or _pervium_, because a main road led through it to the\r\nForum Romanum), Trajan, and Vespasian, although partly intended to\r\nfacilitate the course of public business, were chiefly erected to\r\nembellish the city. The construction of separate markets was not,\r\nhowever, necessarily the rule in the provincial fora; thus, in Pompeii,\r\nat the north-east end of the forum, there was a _macellum_ (market), and\r\nshops for provisions and possibly money changers, and on the east side a\r\nbuilding supposed to have been the clothworkers' exchange, and at Timgad\r\nin North Africa (a military colony founded under Trajan) the whole of\r\nthe south side of the forum was occupied by shops. The forum was usually\r\npaved, and although on festal occasions chariots were probably driven\r\nthrough, it was not a thoroughfare and was enclosed by gates at the\r\nentrances, of which traces have been found at Pompeii. When the sites\r\nfor new towns were being selected, that for the forum was in the centre,\r\nand the two main streets crossed one another close to but not through\r\nit. At Timgad the main streets are some 5 or 6 ft. lower than the forum.\r\nThe word _forum_ frequently appears in the names of Roman market towns;\r\nas, for example, in Forum Appii, Forum Julii (_Frejus_), Forum Livii\r\n(_Forli_), Forum Sempronii (_Fossombrone_). These _fora_ were\r\ndistinguished from mere _vici_ by the possession of a municipal\r\norganization, which, however, was less complete than that of a\r\nprefecture. In legal phraseology, which distinguishes the _forum\r\ncommune_ from the _forum privilegiatum_, and the _forum generale_ from\r\nthe _forum speciale_, the word is practically equivalent to \"court\" or\r\n\"jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n  For the fora at Rome, see ROME: _Archaeology_, and works quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORUM APPII, an ancient post station on the Via Appia, 43 m. S.E. of\r\nRome, founded, no doubt, by the original constructor of the road. Horace\r\nmentions it as the usual halt at the end of the first day's journey from\r\nRome, and describes it as full of boatmen and cheating innkeepers. The\r\npresence of the former was due to the fact that it was the\r\nstarting-point of a canal which ran parallel to the road through the\r\nPomptine Marshes, and was used instead of it at the time of Strabo and\r\nHorace (see APPIA, VIA). It is mentioned also as a halting place in the\r\naccount of Paul's journey to Rome (Acts xxviii. 15). Under Nerva and\r\nTrajan the road was repaired; one inscription records expressly the\r\npaving with silex (replacing the former gravelling) of the section from\r\nTripontium, 4 m. N.W., to Forum Appii; the bridge near Tripontium was\r\nsimilarly repaired, and that at Forum Appii, though it bears no\r\ninscription, is of the same style. Only scanty relics of antiquity have\r\nbeen found here; a post station was placed here by Pius VI. when the Via\r\nAppia was reconstructed.     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORUM CLODII, a post station on the Via Clodia, about 23 m. N.W. of Rome\r\n(not 32 m. as in the _Antonine Itinerary_), situated above the western\r\nbank of the Lacus Sabatinus (mod. Lake of Bracciano), and connected with\r\nthe Via Cassia at Vacanae by a branch road which ran round the N. side\r\nof the lake (_Ann. Inst._, 1859, 43). The site is marked by the church\r\nof SS. Marcus, Marcianus and Liberatus, which was founded in the 8th or\r\n9th century A.D. Inscriptions mentioning the Foro-Clodienses have come\r\nto light on the spot; and an inscription of the Augustan period, which\r\nprobably stood over the door of a villa, calls the place Pausilypon--a\r\nname justified by the beauty of the site.\r\n\r\n  See _Notizie degli scavi_ (1889), 5; D. Vaglieri, ibid. (1895), 342.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORUM TRAIANI (mod. _Fordongianus_), an ancient town of Sardinia, on the\r\nriver Thyrsus (Tirso), and a station on the Roman road through the\r\ncentre of the island from Carales to Olbia and Turris Libisonis. Many of\r\nits ruins have been destroyed since 1860. The best preserved are the\r\nbaths, erected over hot mineral springs. The tanks for collecting the\r\nwater and the large central _piscina_ are noteworthy. The bridge over\r\nthe Tirso has been to some extent modernized. On the opposite bank are\r\nthe scanty remains of an amphitheatre. Not far off is a group of\r\n_nuraghi_, of which that of St Barbara in the commune of Villanova\r\nTruschedda is one of the finest.\r\n\r\n  See Taramelli in _Notizie degli scavi_ (1903), 469.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSBROKE, THOMAS DUDLEY (1770-1842), English antiquary, was born in\r\nLondon on the 27th of May 1770. He was educated at St Paul's school and\r\nPembroke College, Oxford, graduating M.A. in 1792. In that year he was\r\nordained and became curate of Horsley, Gloucestershire, where he\r\nremained till 1810. He then removed to Walford in Herefordshire, and\r\nremained there the rest of his life, as curate till 1830, and afterwards\r\nas vicar. His first important work, _British Monachism_ (2 vols., 1802),\r\nwas a compilation, from manuscripts in the British Museum and Bodleian\r\nlibraries, of facts relating to English monastic life. In 1799 Fosbroke\r\nhad been elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. The work for\r\nwhich he is best remembered, the _Encyclopaedia of Antiquities_,\r\nappeared in 1824. A sequel to this, _Foreign Topography_, was published\r\nin 1828. Fosbroke published many other volumes. He died at Walford on\r\nthe 1st of January 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSCARI, FRANCESCO (1373-1457), doge of Venice, belonged to a noble\r\nVenetian family, and held many of the highest offices of the\r\nrepublic--ambassador, president of the Forty, member of the Council of\r\nTen, inquisitor, procurator of St Mark, _avvogadore di comun_, &c. His\r\nfirst wife was Maria Priuli and his second Maria Nani; of his many\r\nchildren all save one son (Jacopo) died young. But although a capable\r\nadministrator he was ambitious and adventurous, and the reigning doge\r\nTommaso Mocenigo, when speaking on his deathbed of the various\r\ncandidates for the succession, warned the council against electing\r\nFoscari, who, he said, would perpetually plunge the republic into\r\ndisastrous and costly wars. Nevertheless Foscari was elected (1423) and\r\nreigned for thirty-four years. In proclaiming the new doge the customary\r\nformula which recognized the people's share in the appointment and asked\r\nfor their approval--the last vestige of popular government--was finally\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nFoscari's reign bore out Mocenigo's warning and was full of wars on the\r\n_terra ferma_, and through the doge's influence Venice joined the\r\nFlorentines in their campaign against Milan, which was carried on with\r\nvarying success for eight years. In 1430 an attempt was made on\r\nFoscari's life by a noble to whom he had refused an appointment; and\r\nthree years later a conspiracy of young bloods to secure the various\r\noffices for themselves by illicit intrigues was discovered. These\r\nevents, as well as the long and expensive wars and the unsatisfactory\r\nstate of Venetian finances, induced Foscari to ask permission to\r\nabdicate, which was, however, refused. In 1444 began that long domestic\r\ntragedy by which the name of Foscari has become famous. The doge's son\r\nJacopo, a cultivated and intelligent but frivolous and irresponsible\r\nyouth, was in that year accused of the serious crime of having accepted\r\npresents from various citizens and foreign princes who either desired\r\ngovernment appointments or wished to influence the policy of the\r\nrepublic. Jacopo escaped, but was tried in contumacy before the Council\r\nof Ten and condemned to be exiled to Napoli di Romania (Nauplia) and to\r\nhave his property confiscated. But the execution of the sentence was\r\ndelayed, as he was lying ill at Trieste, and eventually the penalty was\r\ncommuted to banishment at Treviso (1446). Four years later Ermolao\r\nDonato, a distinguished official who had been a member of the Ten at the\r\ntime of the trial, was assassinated and Jacopo Foscari was suspected of\r\ncomplicity in the deed. After a long inquiry he was brought to trial for\r\nthe second time, and although all the evidence clearly pointed to his\r\nguilt the judges could not obtain a confession from the accused, and so\r\nmerely banished him to Candia for the rest of his life, with a pension\r\nof two hundred ducats a year. In 1456 the council received information\r\nfrom the rector (governor) of Candia to the effect that Jacopo Foscari\r\nhad been in treasonable correspondence with the duke of Milan and the\r\nsultan of Turkey. He was summoned to Venice, tried and condemned to a\r\nyear's imprisonment, to be followed by a return to his place of exile.\r\nHis aged father was allowed to see him while in prison, and to Jacopo's\r\nentreaties that he should obtain a full pardon for him, he replied\r\nadvising him to bear his punishment without protest. When the year was\r\nup Jacopo returned to Candia, where he died in January 1457. The doge\r\nwas overwhelmed with grief at this bereavement and became quite\r\nincapable of attending to business. Consequently the council decided to\r\nask him to abdicate; at first he refused, but was finally obliged to\r\nconform to their wishes and retired on a yearly pension of 1500 ducats.\r\nWithin a week Pasquale Malipiero was elected in his place and two days\r\nlater (1st of November 1457) Francesco Foscari was dead.\r\n\r\n  The story is a very sad and pathetic one, but legend has added many\r\n  picturesque though quite apocryphal details, most of them tending to\r\n  show the iniquity and harshness of Jacopo's judges and accusers,\r\n  whereas, as we have shown, he was treated with exceptional leniency.\r\n  The most accurate account is contained in S. Romanin's _Storia\r\n  documentata di Venezia_, lib. x. cap. iv. vii. and x. (Venice, 1855);\r\n  where the original authorities are quoted; see also Berlan, _I due\r\n  Foscari_ (Turin, 1852). Among the poetical works on the subject\r\n  Byron's tragedy is the most famous (1821), and Roger's poem _Italy_\r\n  (1821); Giuseppe Verdi composed an opera on the subject entitled _I\r\n  due Foscari_.     (L. V.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSCOLO, UGO (1778-1827), Italian writer, was born at Zante in the\r\nIonian Isles on the 26th of January 1778. On the death of his father, a\r\nphysician at Spalatro, in Dalmatia, the family removed to Venice, and in\r\nthe University of Padua Foscolo prosecuted the studies begun in the\r\nDalmatian grammar school. The fact that amongst his Paduan masters was\r\nthe abbe Cesarotti, whose version of Ossian had made that work highly\r\npopular in Italy, was not without influence on Foscolo's literary\r\ntastes, and his early knowledge of modern facilitated his studies in\r\nancient Greek. His literary ambition revealed itself by the appearance\r\nin 1797 of his tragedy _Tieste_--a production which obtained a certain\r\ndegree of success. Foscolo, who, from causes not clearly explained, had\r\nchanged his Christian name Niccolo to that of Ugo, now began to take an\r\nactive part in the stormy political discussions which the fall of the\r\nrepublic of Venice had provoked. He was a prominent member of the\r\nnational committees, and addressed an ode to Napoleon the liberator,\r\nexpecting from the military successes of the French general, not merely\r\nthe overthrow of the effete Venetian oligarchy, but the establishment of\r\na free republican government.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Campo Formio (17th Oct. 1797), by which Napoleon handed\r\nVenice over to the Austrians, gave a rude shock to Foscolo, but did not\r\nquite destroy his hopes. The state of mind produced by that shock is\r\nreflected in the _Letters of Jacopo Ortis_ (1798), a species of\r\npolitical _Werther_,--for the hero of Foscolo embodies the mental\r\nsufferings and suicide of an undeceived Italian patriot just as the hero\r\nof Goethe places before us the too delicate sensitiveness embittering\r\nand at last cutting short the life of a private German scholar. The\r\nstory of Foscolo, like that of Goethe, had a groundwork of melancholy\r\nfact. Jacopo Ortis had been a real personage; he was a young student of\r\nPadua, and committed suicide there under circumstances akin to those\r\ndescribed by Foscolo. At this period Foscolo's mind appears to have been\r\nonly too familiar with the thought of suicide. Cato and the many\r\nclassical examples of self-destruction scattered through the pages of\r\nPlutarch appealed to the imaginations of young Italian patriots as they\r\nhad done in France to those of the heroes and heroines of the Gironde.\r\nIn the case of Foscolo, as in that of Goethe, the effect produced on the\r\nwriter's mind by the composition of the work seems to have been\r\nbeneficial. He had seen the ideal of a great national future rudely\r\nshattered; but he did not despair of his country, and sought relief in\r\nnow turning to gaze on the ideal of a great national poet. At Milan,\r\nwhither he repaired after the fall of Venice, he was engaged in other\r\nliterary pursuits besides the composition of _Ortis_. The friendship\r\nformed there with the great poet Parini was ever afterwards remembered\r\nwith pride and gratitude. The friendship formed with another celebrated\r\nMilanese poet soon gave place to a feeling of bitter enmity. Still\r\nhoping that his country would be freed by Napoleon, he served as a\r\nvolunteer in the French army, took part in the battle of the Trebbia and\r\nthe siege of Genoa, was wounded and made prisoner. When released he\r\nreturned to Milan, and there gave the last touches to his _Ortis_,\r\npublished a translation of and commentary upon _Callimachus_, commenced\r\na version of the _Iliad_, and began his translation of Sterne's\r\n_Sentimental Journey_. The result of a memorandum prepared for Lyons,\r\nwhere, along with other Italian delegates, he was to have laid before\r\nNapoleon the state of Italy, only proved that the views cherished by him\r\nfor his country were too bold to be even submitted to the dictator of\r\nFrance. The year 1807 witnessed the appearance of his _Carme sui\r\nsepolcri_, of which the entire spirit and language may be described as a\r\nsublime effort to seek refuge in the past from the misery of the present\r\nand the darkness of the future. The mighty dead are summoned from their\r\ntombs, as ages before they had been in the masterpieces of Greek\r\noratory, to fight again the battles of their country. The inaugural\r\nlecture on the origin and duty of literature, delivered by Foscolo in\r\nJanuary 1809 when appointed to the chair of Italian eloquence at Pavia,\r\nwas conceived in the same spirit. In this lecture Foscolo urged his\r\nyoung countrymen to study letters, not in obedience to academic\r\ntraditions, but in their relation to individual and national life and\r\ngrowth. The sensation produced by this lecture had no slight share in\r\nprovoking the decree of Napoleon by which the chair of national\r\neloquence was abolished in all the Italian universities. Soon afterwards\r\nFoscolo's tragedy of _Ajax_ was represented but with little success at\r\nMilan, and its supposed allusions to Napoleon rendering the author an\r\nobject of suspicion, he was forced to remove from Milan to Tuscany. The\r\nchief fruits of his stay in Florence are the tragedy of _Ricciarda_, the\r\n_Ode to the Graces_, left unfinished, and the completion of his version\r\nof the _Sentimental Journey_ (1813). His version of Sterne is an\r\nimportant feature in his personal history. When serving with the French\r\nhe had been at the Boulogne camp, and had traversed much of the ground\r\ngone over by Yorick; and in his memoir of Didimo Cherico, to whom the\r\nversion is ascribed, he throws much curious light on his own character.\r\nHe returned to Milan in 1813, until the entry of the Austrians; thence\r\nhe passed into Switzerland, where he wrote a fierce satire in Latin on\r\nhis political and literary opponents; and finally he sought the shores\r\nof England at the close of 1816.\r\n\r\nDuring the eleven years passed by Foscolo in London, until his death\r\nthere, he enjoyed all the social distinction which the most brilliant\r\ncircles of the English capital confer on foreigners of political and\r\nliterary renown, and experienced all the misery which follows on a\r\ndisregard of the first conditions of domestic economy. His contributions\r\nto the _Edinburgh_ and _Quarterly Reviews_, his dissertations in Italian\r\non the text of Dante and Boccaccio, and still more his English essays on\r\nPetrarch, of which the value was enhanced by Lady Dacre's admirable\r\ntranslations of some of Petrarch's finest sonnets, heightened his\r\nprevious fame as a man of letters. But his want of care and forethought\r\nin pecuniary matters involved him in much embarrassment, and at last\r\nconsigned him to a prison; and when released he felt bitterly the change\r\nin his social position, and the coldness now shown to him by many whom\r\nhe had been accustomed to regard as friends. His general bearing in\r\nsociety--if we may accept on this point the testimony of so keen an\r\nobserver and so tolerant a man as Sir Walter Scott--had unhappily not\r\nbeen such as to gain and retain lasting friendships. He died at Turnham\r\nGreen on the 10th of October 1827. Forty-four years after his death, in\r\n1871, his remains were brought to Florence, and with all the pride, pomp\r\nand circumstance of a great national mourning, found their final\r\nresting-place beside the monuments of Machiavelli and Alfieri, of\r\nMichelangelo and Galileo, in Italy's Westminster Abbey, the church of\r\nSanta Croce. To that solemn national tribute Foscolo was fully entitled.\r\nFor the originality of his thoughts and the splendour of his diction his\r\ncountry honours him as a great classic author. He had assigned to the\r\nliterature of his nation higher aims than any which it previously\r\nrecognized. With all his defects of character, and through all his\r\nvicissitudes of fortune, he was always a sincere and courageous patriot.\r\n\r\n  Ample materials for the study of Foscolo's character and career may be\r\n  found in the complete series of his works published in Florence by Le\r\n  Monnier. The series consists of _Prose letterarie_, (4 vols., 1850);\r\n  _Epistolario_ (3 vols., 1854); _Prose politiche_ (1 vol., 1850);\r\n  _Poesie_ (1 vol., 1856); _Lettere di Ortis_ (1 vol., 1858); _Saggi di\r\n  critica storico-letteraria_ (1st vol., 1859; 2nd vol., 1862). To this\r\n  series must be added the very interesting work published at Leghorn in\r\n  1876, _Lettere inedite del Foscolo, del Giordani, e della Signora di\r\n  Stael, a Vincenzo Monti_. The work published at Florence in the summer\r\n  of 1878, _Vita di Ugo Foscolo, di Pellegrino Artusi_, throws much\r\n  doubt on the genuineness of the text in Foscolo's writings as given in\r\n  the complete Florence edition, whilst it furnishes some curious and\r\n  original illustrations of Foscolo's familiarity with the English\r\n  language.     (J. M. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSS, EDWARD (1787-1870), English lawyer and biographer, was born in\r\nLondon on the 16th of October 1787. He was a solicitor by profession,\r\nand on his retirement from practice in 1840, he devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of legal antiquities. His _Judges of England_ (9 vols., 1848-1864)\r\nis a standard work, characterized by accuracy and extensive research.\r\n_Biographia Juridica_, _a Biographical Dictionary of English Judges_,\r\nappeared shortly after his death. He assisted in founding the\r\nIncorporated Law Society, of which he was president in 1842 and 1843. He\r\ndied of apoplexy on the 27th of July 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSANO, a town and episcopal see of Piedmont, Italy, in the province of\r\nCuneo, 15 m. N.E. of it by rail, 1180 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901)\r\n7696 (town), 18,175 (commune). It has an imposing castle with four\r\ntowers, begun by Filippo d'Acaia in 1314. The cathedral was\r\nreconstructed at the end of the 18th century. The place began to acquire\r\nsome importance in the 13th century. It appears as a commune in 1237,\r\nbut in 1251 had to yield to Asti. It finally surrendered in 1314 to\r\nFilippo d'Acaia, whose successor handed it over to the house of Savoy.\r\nIt lies on the main line from Turin to Cuneo, and has a branch line to\r\nMondovi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSANUOVA, an abbey of Italy, in the province of Rome, near the railway\r\nstation of Sonnino, 64 m. S.E. of Rome. It is the finest example of a\r\nCistercian abbey, and of the Burgundian Early Gothic style, in Italy,\r\nand dates from the end of the 12th to the end of the 13th century. The\r\nchurch (1187-1208) is closely similar to that of Casamari. The other\r\nconventual buildings also are noteworthy. Thomas Aquinas died here in\r\n1274.\r\n\r\n  See C. Enlart, _Origines francaises de l'architecture gothique en\r\n  Italie_ (Paris, 1894) (_Bibliotheque des ecoles francaises d'Athenes\r\n  et de Rome_, fasc. 66).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSE (or FOSS) WAY, the Early English name of a Roman road or series of\r\nroads in Britain, used later by the English, running from Lincoln by\r\nLeicester and Bath to Exeter. Almost all the Roman line is still in use\r\nas modern road or lane. It passes from Lincoln through Newark and\r\nLeicester (the Roman _Ratae_) to High Cross (_Venonae_), where it\r\nintersects Watling Street at a point often called \"the centre of\r\nEngland.\" Hence it runs to Moreton-in-the-Marsh, Cirencester, Bath and\r\nIlchester, crosses the hills near Chard, Axminster and Honiton, and\r\nenters Exeter. Antiquaries have taken it farther, usually to Totnes, but\r\nwithout warrant. (See further under ERMINE STREET.)     (F. J. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSICK (probably an English dialectical expression, meaning fussy or\r\ntroublesome), a term applied by the gold diggers of Australia to the\r\nsearch for gold by solitary individuals, in untried localities or in\r\nabandoned diggings. A \"fossicker,\" or pocket miner, is one who buys up\r\nthe right to search old claims, in the hope of finding gold overlooked\r\nby previous diggers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSOMBRONE (anc. _Forum Sempronii_), a town and episcopal see of the\r\nMarches, Italy, in the province of Pesaro and Urbino, 11 m. E.S.E. of\r\nthe latter by road, 394 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) town, 7531,\r\ncommune, 10,847. The town is situated in the valley of the Metauro, in\r\nthe centre of fine scenery, at the meeting-point of roads to Fano, to\r\nthe Furlo pass and Fossato di Vico (the ancient Via Flaminia), to Urbino\r\nand to Sinigaglia, the last crossing the river by a fine bridge. The\r\ncathedral, rebuilt in 1772-1784, contains the chief work of the sculptor\r\nDomenico Rosselli of Rovezzano, a richly sculptured _ancona_ of 1480. S.\r\nFrancesco has a lunette by him over the portal. The library, founded by\r\na nephew of Cardinal Passionei, contains some antiquities. Above the\r\ntown is a medieval castle. There is a considerable trade in silk.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Forum Sempronii lay about 2 m. to the N.E. at S. Martino al\r\nPiano, where remains still exist. It was a station on the Via Flaminia\r\nand a _municipium_. The date of its foundation is not known. Excavations\r\nin 1879-1880 led to the discovery of a house and of other buildings on\r\nthe ancient road (A. Vernarecci in _Notizie degli scavi_, 1880, 458).\r\nIt already had a bishop in the years 499-502. In 1295 the Malatesta\r\nobtained possession of it, and kept it until 1444, when it was sold,\r\nwith Pesaro, to Federico di Montefeltro of Urbino, and with the latter\r\nit passed to the papacy under Urban VIII. in 1631.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSOMBRONI, VITTORIO, COUNT (1754-1844), Tuscan statesman and\r\nmathematician, was born at Arezzo. He was educated at the university of\r\nPisa, where he devoted himself particularly to mathematics. He obtained\r\nan official appointment in Tuscany in 1782, and twelve years later was\r\nentrusted by the grand duke with the direction of the works for the\r\ndrainage of the Val di Chiana, on which subject he had published a\r\ntreatise in 1789. In 1796 he was made minister for foreign affairs, but\r\non the French occupation of Tuscany in 1799 he fled to Sicily. On the\r\nerection of the grand duchy into the ephemeral kingdom of Etruria, under\r\nthe queen-regent Maria Louisa, he was appointed president of the\r\ncommission of finance. In 1809 he went to Paris as one of the senators\r\nfor Tuscany to pay homage to Napoleon. He was made president of the\r\nlegislative commission on the restoration of the grand duke Ferdinand\r\nIII. in 1814, and subsequently prime minister, which position he\r\nretained under the grand duke Leopold II. His administration, which was\r\nonly terminated by his death, greatly contributed to promote the\r\nwell-being of the country. He was the real master of Tuscany, and the\r\nbases of his rule were equality of all subjects before the law, honesty\r\nin the administration of justice and toleration of opinion, but he\r\ntotally neglected the moral improvement of the people. At the age of\r\nseventy-eight he married, and twelve years afterwards died, in 1844.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Gino Capponi, _Il Conte V.

Conjointly with William Topley (1841-1894) he\r\ncommunicated to the Geological Society of London in 1865 the now classic\r\npaper \"On the superficial deposits of the Valley of the Medway, with\r\nremarks on the Denudation of the Weald.\" In this paper the sculpturing\r\nof the Wealden area by rain and rivers was ably advocated. Retiring from\r\nthe Geological Survey in 1865, Foster devoted his attention to\r\nmineralogy and mining in Cornwall, Egypt and Venezuela. In 1872 he was\r\nappointed an inspector of mines under the home office for the S.W. of\r\nEngland, and in 1880 he was transferred to the N. Wales district. In\r\n1890 he was appointed professor of mining at the Royal College of\r\nScience and he held this post until the close of his life. His later\r\nwork is embodied largely in the reports of mines and quarries issued\r\nannually by the home office. He was distinguished for his extensive\r\nscientific and practical knowledge of metalliferous mining and stone\r\nquarrying. He was elected F.R.S. in 1892 and was knighted in 1903. While\r\ninvestigating the cause of a mining disaster in the Isle of Man in 1897\r\nhis constitution suffered much injury from carbonic-oxide gas, and he\r\nnever fully recovered from the effects. He died in London on the 19th of\r\nApril 1904. He published _Ore and Stone Mining_, 1894 (ed. 5, 1904); and\r\n_The Elements of Mining and Quarrying_, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER, GEORGE EULAS (1847- ), Canadian politician and financier, was\r\nborn in New Brunswick on the 3rd of September 1847, of U.E. Loyalist\r\ndescent. After a brilliant university career at the university of\r\nBrunswick, at Edinburgh and Heidelberg, he returned to Canada and taught\r\nin various local schools, eventually becoming professor of classics and\r\nhistory in the local university. In 1882 he became Conservative member\r\nfor King's County, N.B., in the Dominion parliament, and in 1885 entered\r\nthe cabinet of Sir John Macdonald as minister of marine and fisheries;\r\nin 1888 he became minister of finance, which position he held till the\r\ndefeat of his party in 1896. A careful and even brilliant financier, and\r\na keen debater, he became known as a strong believer in protection for\r\nCanadian industries and in preferential trade within the British empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER, JOHN (1770-1843), English author and dissenting minister,\r\ngenerally known as the \"Essayist,\" was born in a small farmhouse near\r\nHalifax, Yorkshire, on the 17th of September 1770. Partly from\r\nconstitutional causes, but partly also from the want of proper\r\ncompanions, as well as from the grave and severe habits of his parents,\r\nhis earlier years were enshrouded in a somewhat gloomy and sombre\r\natmosphere, which was never afterwards wholly dissipated. His youthful\r\nenergy, finding no proper outlet, developed within him a tendency to\r\nmorbid intensity of thought and feeling; and, according to his own\r\ntestimony, before he was twelve years old he was possessed of a \"painful\r\nsense of an awkward but entire individuality.\"\r\n\r\nThe small income accruing to Foster's parents from their farm they\r\nsupplemented by weaving, and at an early age he began to assist them by\r\nspinning wool by the hand wheel, and from his fourteenth year by weaving\r\ndouble stuffs. Even \"when a child,\" however, he had the \"feelings of a\r\nforeigner in the place\"; and though he performed his monotonous task\r\nwith conscientious diligence, he succeeded so indifferently in fixing\r\nhis wandering thoughts upon it that his work never without difficulty\r\npassed the ordeal of inspection. He had acquired a great taste for\r\nreading, to gratify which he sometimes shut himself up alone in a barn,\r\nafterwards working at his loom \"like a horse,\" to make up for lost time.\r\nHe had also at this period \"a passion for making pictures with a pen.\"\r\nShortly after completing his seventeenth year he became a member of the\r\nBaptist church at Hebden Bridge, with which his parents were connected;\r\nand with the view of preparing himself for the ministerial office he\r\nbegan about the same time to attend a seminary at Brearley Hall\r\nconducted by his pastor Dr Fawcett.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining three years at Brearley Hall he was admitted to the\r\nBaptist College, Bristol, and on finishing his course of study at this\r\ninstitution he obtained an engagement at Newcastle-on-Tyne, where he\r\npreached to an audience of less than a hundred persons, in a small and\r\ndingy room situated near the river at the top of a flight of steps\r\ncalled Tuthill Stairs. At Newcastle he remained only three months. In\r\nthe beginning of 1793 he proceeded to Dublin, where, after failing as a\r\npreacher, he attempted to revive a classical and mathematical school,\r\nbut with so little success that he did not prosecute the experiment for\r\nmore than eight or nine months. From 1797 to 1799 he was minister of a\r\nBaptist church at Chichester, but though he applied himself with more\r\nearnestness and perseverance than formerly to the discharge of his\r\nministerial duties, his efforts produced little apparent impression, and\r\nthe gradual diminution of his hearers necessitated his resignation.\r\nAfter employing himself for a few months at Battersea in the instruction\r\nof twenty African youths brought to England by Zachary Macaulay, with\r\nthe view of having them trained to aid as missionaries to their\r\nfellow-countrymen, he in 1800 accepted the charge of a small\r\ncongregation at Downend, Bristol, where he continued about four years.\r\nIn 1804, chiefly through the recommendation of Robert Hall, he became\r\npastor of a congregation at Frome, but a swelling in the thyroid gland\r\ncompelled him in 1806 to resign his charge. In the same year he\r\npublished the volume of _Essays_ on which his literary fame most largely\r\nif not mainly rests. They were written in the form of letters addressed\r\nto the lady whom he afterwards married, and consist of four papers,--\"On\r\na Man writing Memoirs of himself\"; \"On Decision of Character\"; \"On the\r\nApplication of the Epithet Romantic\"; and \"On some Causes by which\r\nEvangelical Religion has been rendered unacceptable to Men of Cultivated\r\nTaste.\" The success of this work was immediate, and was so considerable\r\nthat on resigning his charge he determined to adopt literature as his\r\nprofession. The _Eclectic Review_ was the only periodical with which he\r\nestablished a connexion; but his contributions to that journal, which\r\nwere begun in 1807, number no fewer than 185 articles. On his marriage\r\nin May 1808 he removed to Bourton-on-the-Water, a small village in\r\nGloucestershire, where he remained till 1817, when he returned to\r\nDownend and resumed his duties to his old congregation. Here he\r\npublished in 1820 his _Essay on Popular Ignorance_, which was the\r\nenlargement of a sermon originally preached on behalf of the British and\r\nForeign School Society. In 1821 he removed to Stapleton near Bristol,\r\nand in 1822 he began a series of fortnightly lectures at Broadmead\r\nchapel, Bristol, which were afterwards published. On the settlement of\r\nRobert Hall at Bristol this service was discontinued, as in such\r\ncircumstances it appeared to Foster to be \"altogether superfluous and\r\neven bordering on impertinent.\" The health of Foster during the later\r\nyears of his life was somewhat infirm, the result chiefly of the toil\r\nand effort of literary composition; and the death of his only son, his\r\nwife and the greater number of his most intimate friends combined with\r\nhis bodily ailments to lend additional sombreness to his manner of\r\nregarding the events and arrangements of the present world--the \"visage\r\nof death\" being almost his \"one remaining luminary.\" He died at\r\nStapleton on the 15th of October 1843.\r\n\r\nThe cast of Foster's mind was meditative and reflective rather than\r\nlogical or metaphysical, and though holding moderately Calvinistic\r\nviews, his language even in preaching very seldom took the mould of\r\ntheological forms. Though always retaining his connexion with the\r\nBaptist denomination, the evils resulting from organized religious\r\ncommunities seemed to him so great that he came to be \"strongly of\r\nopinion that churches are useless and mischievous institutions, and the\r\nsooner they are dissolved the better.\" The only Christian observances\r\nwhich he regarded as of any importance were public worship and the\r\nLord's Supper, and it so happened that he never administered the\r\nordinance of baptism. His cast of thought is largely coloured by a\r\nconstant reference to the \"endless future.\" He was a firm believer in\r\nsupernatural appearances, and cherished a longing hope that a ray of\r\nlight from the other world might sometimes in this way be vouchsafed to\r\nmortals. As a writer he was most painstaking and laborious in his choice\r\nof diction, and his style has its natural consequent defects, though the\r\nresult is eloquent in its way.\r\n\r\n  Besides the works already alluded to, Foster was the author of a\r\n  _Discourse on Missions_ (1818); \"Introductory Essay\" to Doddridge's\r\n  _Rise and Progress of Religion_ (1825); \"Observations on Mr Hall's\r\n  Character as a Preacher,\" prefixed to the collected edition of Hall's\r\n  _Works_ (1832); an \"Introduction\" to a pamphlet by Mr Marshman on the\r\n  Serampore Missionaries; several political letters to the _Morning\r\n  Chronicle_, and contributions to the _Eclectic Review_, published\r\n  posthumously in 2 vols., 1844. _His Life and Correspondence_, edited\r\n  by J.E. Ryland, was published in 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER, SIR MICHAEL (1836-1907), English physiologist, was born at\r\nHuntingdon on the 8th of March 1836. After graduating in medicine at\r\nLondon University in 1859, he began to practise in his native town, but\r\nin 1867 he returned to London as teacher of practical physiology at\r\nUniversity College, where two years afterwards he became professor. In\r\n1870 he was appointed by Trinity College, Cambridge, to its\r\npraelectorship in physiology, and thirteen years later he became the\r\nfirst occupant of the newly-created chair of physiology in the\r\nuniversity, holding it till 1903. He excelled as a teacher and\r\nadministrator, and had a very large share in the organization and\r\ndevelopment of the Cambridge biological school. From 1881 to 1903 he was\r\none of the secretaries of the Royal Society, and in that capacity\r\nexercised a wide influence on the study of biology in Great Britain. In\r\n1899 he was created K.C.B., and served as president of the British\r\nAssociation at its meeting at Dover. In the following year he was\r\nelected to represent the university of London in parliament. Though\r\nreturned as a Unionist, his political action was not to be dictated by\r\nparty considerations, and he gravitated towards Liberalism; but he\r\nplayed no prominent part in parliament and at the election of 1906 was\r\ndefeated. His chief writings were a _Textbook of Physiology_ (1876),\r\nwhich became a standard work, and _Lectures on the History of Physiology\r\nin the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries_ (1901), which consisted of\r\nlectures delivered at the Cooper Medical College, San Francisco, in\r\n1900. He died suddenly in London on the 29th of January 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER, MYLES BIRKET (1825-1899), English painter, was born at North\r\nShields. At the age of sixteen he entered the workshop of Ebenezer\r\nLandells, a wood engraver, with whom he worked for six years as an\r\nillustrative draughtsman, devoting himself mainly to landscape. During\r\nthe succeeding fifteen years he became famous as a prolific and\r\naccomplished illustrator, but about 1861 abandoned illustration for\r\npainting, and gained wide popularity by his pictures, chiefly in water\r\ncolours, of landscapes and rustic subjects, with figures, mainly of\r\nchildren. He was elected in 1860 associate and in 1862 full member of\r\nthe Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours. His work is memorable\r\nfor its delicacy and minute finish, and for its daintiness and\r\npleasantness of sentiment.\r\n\r\n  See _Birket Foster, his Life and Work_ (extra number of the _Art\r\n  Journal_) by Marcus B. Huish (1890), an interesting sketch; and\r\n  _Birket Foster, R.W.S._, by H.M. Cundall (London, 1906), a very\r\n  complete and fully illustrated biography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER, STEPHEN COLLINS (1826-1864), American song and ballad writer,\r\nwas born near Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on the 4th of July 1826. He was\r\nthe youngest child of a merchant of Irish descent who became a member of\r\nthe state legislature and was related by marriage to President Buchanan.\r\nStephen early showed talent for music, and played upon the flageolet,\r\nthe guitar and the banjo; he also acquired a fair knowledge of French\r\nand German. He was sent to school in Towanda, Pennsylvania, and later to\r\nAthens, Pennsylvania, and when thirteen years old he wrote the song\r\n\"Sadly to Mine Heart Appealing.\" At sixteen he wrote \"Open thy Lattice,\r\nLove\"; at seventeen he entered his brother's business house, Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, where he remained about three years, composing meanwhile such\r\npopular pieces as \"Old Uncle Ned,\" \"O Susannah!\" and others. He then\r\nadopted song-writing as a profession. His chief successes were songs\r\nwritten for the negro melodists or Christy minstrels. Besides those\r\nmentioned the following attained great popularity: \"Nelly was a Lady,\"\r\n\"Old Kentucky Home,\" \"Old Folks at Home,\" \"Massa's in de Cold, Cold\r\nGround,\" &c. For these and other songs the composer received\r\nconsiderable sums, \"Old Folks at Home\" bringing him, it is said, 15,000\r\ndollars. For most of his songs Foster wrote both songs and music. In\r\n1850 he married and moved to New York, but soon returned to Pittsburg.\r\nHis reputation rests chiefly on his negro melodies, many of which have\r\nbeen popular on both sides of the Atlantic and sung in many tongues.\r\n\"Old Black Joe,\" the last of these negro melodies, appeared in 1861. His\r\nlater songs were sentimental ballads. Among these are \"Old Dog Tray,\"\r\n\"Gentle Annie,\" \"Willie, we have missed you,\" &c. His \"Come where my\r\nLove lies Dreaming\" is a well known vocal quartet. Although as a\r\nmusician and composer Foster has little claim to high rank, his\r\nsong-writing gives him a prominent place in the modern developments of\r\npopular music. He died at New York on the 13th of January 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTORIA, a city, partly in Seneca, partly in Hancock, and partly in\r\nWood county, Ohio, U.S.A., 35 m. S. by E. of Toledo. Pop. (1890) 7070;\r\n(1900) 7730 (584 foreign-born); (1910) 9597. It is served by the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio, the New York, Chicago & St Louis, the Ohio Central,\r\nthe Lake Erie & Western, and the Hocking Valley railways, and by two\r\ninterurban electric lines. The city is situated in an agricultural\r\nregion, and oil abounds in the vicinity. Among the city's manufactures\r\nare glass, flour, planing mill products, brass and iron, carriages,\r\nbarrels, incandescent lamps, carbons, wire nails and fences, automobile\r\nengines and parts, railway torpedoes and muslin underwear. The\r\nwaterworks are owned and operated by the municipality. In 1832, upon the\r\ncoming of the first settlers, two towns, Rome and Risdon, were laid out\r\non the site of what is now Fostoria. A bitter rivalry arose between\r\nthem, but they were finally united under one government, and the city\r\nthus formed was named in honour of Charles W. Foster, whose son Charles\r\nFoster (1828-1904), governor of the state from 1880 to 1884 and\r\nsecretary of the United States treasury from 1891 to 1893, did much to\r\npromote its growth. Fostoria was chartered as a city in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOTHERGILL, JOHN (1712-1780), English physician, was born of a Quaker\r\nfamily on the 8th of March 1712 at Carr End in Yorkshire. He took the\r\ndegree of M.D. at Edinburgh in 1736, and after visiting the continent of\r\nEurope he in 1740 settled in London, where he gained an extensive\r\npractice. In the epidemics of influenza in 1775 and 1776 he is said to\r\nhave had sixty patients daily. In his leisure he made a study of\r\nconchology and botany; and at Upton, near Stratford, he had an extensive\r\nbotanical garden where he grew many rare plants obtained from various\r\nparts of the world. He was the patron of Sidney Parkinson, the South Sea\r\nvoyager. A translation of the Bible (1764 sq.) by Anthony Purver, a\r\nQuaker, was made and printed at his expense. His pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Account of the Sore Throat attended with Ulcers\" (1748) contains one of\r\nthe first descriptions of diphtheria in English, and was translated into\r\nseveral languages. He died in London on the 26th of December 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOTHERINGHAY, a village of Northamptonshire, England, picturesquely\r\nsituated on the left bank of the river Nene, 1-1/2 m. from Elton station\r\non the Peterborough branch of the London & North-Western railway. The\r\ncastle, of which nothing but the earthworks and foundations remain, is\r\nfamous as the scene of the imprisonment of Mary queen of Scots from\r\nSeptember 1586 to her trial and execution on the 8th of February 1587.\r\nThe earthworks, commanding a ford of the river, are apparently of very\r\nearly date, and probably bore a castle from Norman times. It became an\r\nimportant stronghold of the Plantagenets from the time of Edward III.,\r\nand was the birthplace of Richard III. in 1452. The church of St Mary\r\nand All Saints, originally collegiate, is Perpendicular, and only the\r\nnave with aisles, and the tower surmounted by an octagon, remain; but\r\nthe building is in the best style of its period. Edward, second duke of\r\nYork, who was killed at the battle of Agincourt in 1415, Richard, the\r\nthird duke, and his duchess, Cicely (d. 1495), also his son the earl of\r\nRutland, who with Richard himself, fell at the battle of Wakefield in\r\n1460, are buried in the church. Their monuments were erected by Queen\r\nElizabeth, who found the choir and tombs in ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUCAULT, JEAN BERNARD LEON (1819-1868), French physicist, was the son\r\nof a publisher at Paris, where he was born on the 18th of September\r\n1819. After an education received chiefly at home, he studied medicine,\r\nwhich, however, he speedily abandoned for physical science, the\r\nimprovement of L.J.M. Daguerre's photographic processes being the object\r\nto which he first directed his attention. During three years he was\r\nexperimental assistant to Alfred Donne (1801-1878) in his course of\r\nlectures on microscopic anatomy. With A.H.L. Fizeau he carried on a\r\nseries of investigations on the intensity of the light of the sun, as\r\ncompared with that of carbon in the electric arc, and of lime in the\r\nflame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; on the interference of heat rays, and\r\nof light rays differing greatly in lengths of path; and on the chromatic\r\npolarization of light. In 1849 he contributed to the _Comptes Rendus_ a\r\ndescription of an electromagnetic regulator for the electric arc lamp,\r\nand, in conjunction with H.V. Regnault, a paper on binocular vision. By\r\nthe use of a revolving mirror similar to that used by Sir Charles\r\nWheatstone for measuring the rapidity of electric currents, he was\r\nenabled in 1850 to demonstrate the greater velocity of light in air than\r\nin water, and to establish that the velocity of light in different media\r\nis inversely as the refractive indices of the media. For his\r\ndemonstration in 1851 of the diurnal motion of the earth by the rotation\r\nof the plane of oscillation of a freely suspended, long and heavy\r\npendulum exhibited by him at the Pantheon in Paris, and again in the\r\nfollowing year by means of his invention the gyroscope, he received the\r\nCopley medal of the Royal Society in 1855, and in the same year he was\r\nmade physical assistant in the imperial observatory at Paris. In\r\nSeptember of that year he discovered that the force required for the\r\nrotation of a copper disk becomes greater when it is made to rotate\r\nwith its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disk at the same time\r\nbecoming heated by the eddy or \"Foucault currents\" induced in its metal.\r\nFoucault invented in 1857 the polarizer which bears his name, and in the\r\nsucceeding year devised a method of giving to the speculum of reflecting\r\ntelescopes the form of a spheroid or a paraboloid of revolution. With\r\nWheatstone's revolving mirror he in 1862 determined the absolute\r\nvelocity of light to be 298,000 kilometres (about 185,000 m.) a second,\r\nor 10,000 kilom. less than that obtained by previous experimenters. He\r\nwas created in that year a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and an\r\nofficer of the Legion of Honour, in 1864 a foreign member of the Royal\r\nSociety of London, and next year a member of the mechanical section of\r\nthe Institute. In 1865 appeared his papers on a modification of Watt's\r\ngovernor, upon which he had for some time been experimenting with a view\r\nto making its period of revolution constant, and on a new apparatus for\r\nregulating the electric light; and in the following year (_Compt. Rend._\r\nlxiii.) he showed how, by the deposition of a transparently thin film of\r\nsilver on the outer side of the object glass of a telescope, the sun\r\ncould be viewed without injuring the eye by excess of light. Foucault\r\ndied of paralysis on the 11th of February 1868 at Paris. From the year\r\n1845 he edited the scientific portion of the _Journal des Debats_. His\r\nchief scientific papers are to be found in the _Comptes Rendus_,\r\n1847-1869.\r\n\r\n  See _Revue cours scient._ vi. (1869), pp. 484-489; _Proc. Roy. Soc._\r\n  xvii. (1869), pp. lxxxiii.-lxxxiv.; Lissajous, _Notice historique sur\r\n  la vie et les travaux de Leon Foucault_ (Paris, 1875).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUCHE, JOSEPH, DUKE OF OTRANTO (1763-1820), French statesman, was born\r\nin a small village near Nantes on the 21st of May 1763. His father, a\r\nseafaring man, destined him for the sea; but the weakness of his frame\r\nand the precocity of his talents soon caused this idea to be given up.\r\nHe was educated at the college of the Oratorians at Nantes, and showed\r\nmarked aptitude for studies both literary and scientific. Desiring to\r\nenter the teaching profession he was sent to an institution kept by\r\nbrethren of the same order at Paris. There also he made rapid progress,\r\nand soon entered upon tutorial duties at the colleges of Niort, Saumur,\r\nVendome, Juilly and Arras. At Arras he had some dealings with\r\nRobespierre at the time of the beginning of the French Revolution\r\n(1789).\r\n\r\nIn October 1790 he was transferred by the Oratorians to their college at\r\nNantes, owing to irregularities due to his zeal for revolutionary\r\nprinciples; but at Nantes he showed even more democratic fervour. His\r\nabilities and the zeal with which he espoused the most subversive\r\nnotions brought him into favour with the populace at Nantes; he became a\r\nleading member of the local Jacobin club; and on the dissolution of the\r\ncollege of the Oratorians at Nantes in May 1792, Fouche gave up all\r\nconnexion with the church, whose major vows he had not taken. After the\r\ndownfall of the monarchy on the 10th of August 1792, he was elected as\r\ndeputy for the department of the Lower Loire to the National Convention\r\nwhich met at the autumnal equinox and proclaimed the republic. The\r\nliterary and pedagogic sympathies of Fouche at first brought him into\r\ntouch with Condorcet and the party, or group, of the Girondists; but\r\ntheir vacillation at the time of the trial and execution of Louis XVI.\r\n(December 1792-January 21, 1793) led him to espouse the cause of the\r\nJacobins, the less scrupulous and more thoroughgoing champions of\r\nrevolutionary doctrine. On the question of the execution of the king,\r\nFouche, after some preliminary hesitations, expressed himself with the\r\nutmost vigour in favour of immediate execution, and denounced those who\r\n\"wavered before the shadow of a king.\"\r\n\r\nThe crisis which resulted from the declaration of war by the Convention\r\nagainst England and Holland (Feb. 1, 1793), and a little later against\r\nSpain, brought Fouche into notoriety as one of the fiercest of the\r\nJacobinical fanatics who then held power at Paris. While the armies of\r\nthe first coalition threatened the north-east of France, a revolt of the\r\nroyalist peasants of Brittany and la Vendee menaced the Convention on\r\nthe west. That body deputed Fouche with a colleague, Villers, to proceed\r\nto the west as commissioners invested with almost dictatorial powers\r\nfor the crushing of the revolt of \"the whites.\" The vigour with which he\r\ncarried out these duties earned him other work, and he soon held the\r\npost of commissioner of the republic in the department of the Nievre.\r\nTogether with Chaumette, he helped to initiate the atheistical movement,\r\nthe founders of which in the autumn of 1793 began to aim at the\r\nextinction of Christianity in France. In the department of the Nievre he\r\nransacked the churches, sent their spoils to the treasury and\r\nestablished the cult of the goddess of Reason. Over the cemeteries, he\r\nordered these words to be inscribed: \"Death is an eternal sleep.\" He\r\nalso waged war against luxury and wealth, and desired to abolish the use\r\nof money. The new cult was inaugurated at Paris at Notre Dame by the\r\nstrange orgy known as \"The Festival of Reason\" (November 10, 1793).\r\n\r\nFouche then proceeded to Lyons to execute the vengeance of the\r\nConvention on that city, which had revolted against the new Jacobin\r\ntyranny. Preluding his work by a festival remarkable for its obscene\r\nparody of religious rites, he then, along with his colleague, Collot\r\nd'Herbois, set the guillotine and cannon to work with a rigour which\r\nmade his name odious. Modern research, however, proves that at the close\r\nof those horrors Fouche exercised a moderating influence. Outwardly his\r\nconduct was marked by the utmost rigour, and on his return to Paris\r\nearly in April 1794, he thus characterised his policy: \"The blood of\r\ncriminals fertilises the soil of liberty and establishes power on sure\r\nfoundations.\" By that time Robespierre had struck down the other leaders\r\nof the atheistical party; but early in June 1794, at the time of the\r\n\"Festival of the Supreme Being,\" Fouche ventured to mock at the theistic\r\nrevival which Robespierre then inaugurated. Sharp passages of arms took\r\nplace between them, and Robespierre procured the ejection of Fouche from\r\nthe Jacobin Club (July 14, 1794). Fouche, however, was working with his\r\ncustomary skill and energy, and along with Tallien and others, managed\r\nto effect the overthrow of the theistic dictator on Thermidor 10 (July\r\n28), 1794. The ensuing reaction in favour of more merciful methods of\r\ngovernment threatened to sweep away the group of Terrorists who had been\r\nmainly instrumental in carrying through the _coup d'etat_ of Thermidor;\r\nbut, thanks largely to the skill of Fouche in intrigue, they managed for\r\na time to keep at the head of affairs. Discords, however, crept in which\r\nleft him for a time almost isolated, and it needed all his ability to\r\nwithstand the attacks of the moderates. A vigorous attack on him by\r\nBoissy d'Anglas, on the 9th of August 1795, caused him to be arrested,\r\nbut the troubles which ensued in Vendemiaire averted the doom that\r\nseemed to be pending; and he owed his release to the amnesty which was\r\npassed on the proclamation of the new constitution of the year 1795.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing period, known as that of the Directory (1795-1799),\r\nFouche remained at first in obscurity, but the relations which he had\r\nwith the communists, once headed by Chaumette and now by Francois N.\r\n(\"Gracchus\") Babeuf (q.v.), helped him to rise once more. He is said to\r\nhave betrayed to the director Barras the secret of the strange plot\r\nwhich Babeuf and a few accomplices hatched in the year 1796; but recent\r\nresearch has tended to throw doubt on the assertion. His rise from\r\npoverty was slow, but in 1797 he gained an appointment for the supply of\r\nmilitary _materiel_, which offered opportunities direct and indirect.\r\nAfter offering his services to the royalists, whose movement was then\r\ngathering force, he again decided to support the Jacobins and the\r\ndirector Barras (q.v.). In the _coup d'etat_ of Fructidor 1797 he made\r\nhimself serviceable to Barras, who in 1798 appointed him to be French\r\nambassador to the Cisalpine republic. At Milan he carried matters with\r\nso high a hand against the Gallophobes of that government that his\r\nactions were disavowed and he himself was removed; but in the confused\r\nstate in which matters then were, he was able for a time to hold his own\r\nand to intrigue successfully against his successor. Early in 1799 he\r\nreturned to Paris, and after a brief tenure of office as ambassador at\r\nThe Hague, he became minister of police at Paris (July 20, 1799). The\r\nnewly elected director, Sieyes (q.v.), was then in the ascendant and\r\ndesired to curb the excesses of the Jacobins, who had recently reopened\r\ntheir club. Fouche, casting consistency to the winds, closed the\r\nJacobins club in a manner at once daring and clever. Thereupon he hunted\r\ndown the pamphleteers and editors, whether Jacobins or royalists, who\r\nwere obnoxious to the government, so that at the time of the return of\r\nBonaparte from Egypt (October 1799) the ex-Jacobin was one of the most\r\npowerful men in France.\r\n\r\nKnowing well the unpopularity of the directors, Fouche lent himself to\r\nthe schemes of Bonaparte and Sieyes for their overthrow. His activity in\r\nfurthering the _coup d'etat_ of Brumaire 18-19 (November 9-10), 1799,\r\nprocured him the favour of Bonaparte, who kept him in office (v.\r\nNapoleon I.). In the ensuing period of the Consulate (1799-1804) Fouche\r\nbehaved with the utmost adroitness. While curbing the royalists and\r\nextreme Jacobins who at first alone opposed Bonaparte, Fouche was\r\ncareful to temper as far as possible the arbitrary actions of the new\r\nmaster of France. In this difficult task he acquitted himself with so\r\nmuch skill as to earn at times the gratitude even of the royalists.\r\nThus, while countermining a foolish intrigue of theirs in which the\r\nduchesse de Guiche was the chief agent, Fouche took care that she should\r\nescape. Equally skilful was his action in the affair of the so-called\r\nArena-Ceracchi plot, in which the _agents provocateurs_ of the police\r\nwere believed to have played a sinister part. The chief \"conspirators\"\r\nwere easily ensnared and were executed when the affair of Nivose\r\n(December 1800) enabled Bonaparte to act with rigour. This far more\r\nserious attempt (in which royalist conspirators exploded a bomb near the\r\nFirst Consul's carriage with results disastrous to the bystanders) was\r\nsoon seen by Fouche to be the work of royalists; and when the First\r\nConsul, eager to entrap the still formidable Jacobins, sought to fasten\r\nthe blame on them, Fouche firmly declared that he would not only assert\r\nbut would prove that the outrage was the work of royalists. All his\r\nefforts, however, failed to avert the punishment which Bonaparte was\r\nresolved to inflict on the leading Jacobins. In other matters\r\n(especially in that known as the Plot of the Placards in the spring of\r\n1802) Fouche was thought to have secured the Jacobins concerned from the\r\nvengeance of the First Consul. In any case the latter resolved to rid\r\nhimself of a man who had too much power and too much skill in intrigue\r\nto be desirable as a subordinate. On the proclamation of Bonaparte as\r\nFirst Consul for life (August 1, 1802) Fouche was deprived of his\r\noffice; but the blow was softened by the suppression of the ministry of\r\npolice and by the attribution of most of its duties to an extended\r\nministry of justice. Fouche also became a senator and received half of\r\nthe reserve funds of the police which had accumulated during his tenure\r\nof office. He continued, however, to intrigue through his spies, whose\r\ninformation was so superior to that of the new minister of police as to\r\nrender great services to Napoleon at the time of the Cadoudal-Pichegru\r\nconspiracy (February-March 1804).\r\n\r\nAs a result Napoleon, now emperor, brought back Fouche to the\r\nre-constituted ministry of police (July 1804); he also later on\r\nentrusted to him that of the interior. His work was no less important\r\nthan at the time of the Consulate. His police agents were ubiquitous,\r\nand the terror which Napoleon and Fouche inspired, owing to their proven\r\nability to benefit by plots, partly accounts for the absence of\r\nconspiracies after 1804. After Austerlitz (December 1805) Fouche uttered\r\nthe _mot_ of the occasion: \"Sire, Austerlitz has shattered the old\r\naristocracy; the boulevard St Germain no longer conspires.\"\r\n\r\nThat Napoleon retained some feeling of distrust, or even of fear, of\r\nFouche was proved by his conduct in the early days of 1808. While\r\nengaged in the campaign of Spain, the emperor heard rumours that Fouche\r\nand Talleyrand, once bitter enemies, were having interviews at Paris in\r\nwhich Murat, king of Naples, was concerned. At once the sensitive\r\nautocrat hurried to Paris, but found nothing to incriminate Fouche. In\r\nthat year Fouche received the title of duke of Otranto. During the\r\nabsence of Napoleon in Austria in the campaign of 1809, the British\r\nWalcheren expedition threatened for a time the safety of Antwerp.\r\nFouche thereupon issued an order to the prefects of the northern\r\ndepartments of the empire for the mobilization of 60,000 National\r\nGuards. He added to the order a statement in which occurred the words:\r\n\"Let us prove to Europe that although the genius of Napoleon can throw\r\nlustre on France, his presence is not necessary to enable us to repulse\r\nthe enemy.\" The emperor's approval of the measure was no less marked\r\nthan his disapproval of the words just quoted. The next months brought\r\nfurther causes of friction between emperor and minister. The latter,\r\nknowing the desire of his master for peace at the close of the year\r\n1809, undertook on his own account to make secret overtures to the\r\nBritish ministry. A little later Napoleon opened negotiations and found\r\nthat Fouche had forestalled him. His rage against his minister was\r\nextreme, and on the 3rd of June 1810 he dismissed him from his office.\r\nHowever, as it was not the emperor's custom completely to disgrace a man\r\nwho might again be useful, Fouche received the governorship of Rome. He\r\nwent thither, not as governor but as fugitive, for on receiving the\r\nemperor's order to give up certain important documents of his former\r\nministry, he handed over only a few, declaring that the rest were\r\ndestroyed. At this the emperor's anger burst forth again, and Fouche on\r\nlearning, after his arrival at Florence, that the storm was still raging\r\nat Paris, prepared to sail to the United States. Compelled, however, by\r\nstress of weather and sickness to put back again, he found a mediator in\r\nElisa Bonaparte, grand duchess of Tuscany, thanks to whom he was allowed\r\nto settle at Aix and finally to return to his domain of Point Carre. In\r\n1812 he sought vainly to turn Napoleon from the projected invasion of\r\nRussia; and on the return of the emperor in haste from Smorgoni to Paris\r\nat the close of that year, the ex-minister of police was suspected of\r\ncomplicity in the conspiracy of General Malet, which came so strangely\r\nnear to success. From this suspicion Fouche cleared himself and gave the\r\nemperor useful advice concerning internal affairs and the diplomatic\r\nsituation. Nevertheless, the emperor, still distrustful of the\r\narch-intriguer, ordered him to undertake the government of the Illyrian\r\nprovinces. On the break-up of the Napoleonic system in Germany in\r\nOctober 1813 Fouche was ordered to repair to Rome and thence to Naples,\r\nin order to watch the movements of Murat. Before Fouche arrived at\r\nNaples Murat threw off the mask and invaded the Roman territory,\r\nwhereupon Fouche received orders to return to France. He arrived at\r\nParis on the 10th of April 1814 at the time when Napoleon was being\r\nconstrained by his marshals to abdicate.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Fouche at this crisis was characteristic. As senator he\r\nadvised the senate to send a deputation to the comte d'Artois, brother\r\nof Louis XVIII., with a view to a reconciliation between the monarchy\r\nand the nation. A little later he addressed to Napoleon, then at Elba, a\r\nletter begging him in the interests of peace and of France to withdraw\r\nto the United States. To the new sovereign Louis XVIII. he sent an\r\nappeal in favour of liberty and recommending the adoption of measures\r\nwhich would conciliate all interests. It was not successful, but Fouche\r\nremained unmolested.\r\n\r\nThis was far from satisfying him, and when he found that there were no\r\nhopes of advancement, he entered into relations with conspirators who\r\nsought the overthrow of the Bourbons. Lafayette and Davout were\r\nconcerned in the affair, but their refusal to take the course desired by\r\nFouche and other bold spirits led to nothing being done. Soon Napoleon\r\nescaped from Elba and made his way in triumph to Paris. Shortly before\r\nhis arrival at Paris (March 19, 1815) Louis XVIII. sent to Fouche an\r\noffer of the ministry of police, which he declined, saying, \"It is too\r\nlate; the only plan to adopt is to retreat.\" He then foiled an attempt\r\nof the royalists to arrest him, and on the arrival of Napoleon he\r\nreceived for the third time the portfolio of police. That, however, did\r\nnot prevent him from entering into secret relations with Metternich at\r\nVienna, his aim being then, as always, to prepare for all eventualities.\r\nMeanwhile he used all his powers to induce the emperor to popularise his\r\nrule, and he is said to have caused the insertion of the words \"The\r\nsovereignty resides in the people; it is the source of power\" in the\r\ndeclaration of the council of state. But the autocratic tendencies of\r\nNapoleon could scarcely be held in check, and Fouche seeing the fall of\r\nthe emperor to be imminent, took measures to expedite it and secure his\r\nown interests. On the 22nd of June Napoleon abdicated for the second\r\ntime, and Fouche was next day elected president of the commission which\r\nprovisionally governed France. Already he was in touch with Louis\r\nXVIII., then at Ghent, and now secretly received the overtures of his\r\nagent at Paris. While ostensibly working for the recognition of Napoleon\r\nII., he facilitated the success of the Bourbon cause, and thus procured\r\nfor himself a place in the ministry of Louis XVIII. Even his skill,\r\nhowever, was unequal to the task of conciliating hot-headed royalists\r\nwho remembered his vote as regicide and his fanaticism as terrorist. He\r\nresigned office, and after acting for a brief space as ambassador at\r\nDresden, he retired to Prague. Finally he settled at Trieste, where he\r\ndied on the 25th of December 1820. He had accumulated great wealth.\r\n\r\nMarked at the outset by fanaticism, which, though cruel, was at least\r\nconscientious, Fouche's character deteriorated in and after the year\r\n1794 into one of calculating cunning. The transition represented all\r\nthat was worst in the life of France during the period of the Revolution\r\nand Empire. In Fouche the enthusiasm of the earlier period appeared as a\r\ncold, selfish and remorseless fanaticism; in him the bureaucracy of the\r\nperiod 1795-1799 and the autocracy of Napoleon found their ablest\r\ninstrument. Yet his intellectual pride prevented him sinking to the\r\nlevel of a mere tool. His relations to Napoleon were marked by a certain\r\naloofness. He multiplied the means of resistance even to that\r\nirresistible autocrat, so that though removed from office, he was never\r\nwholly disgraced. Despised by all for his tergiversations, he\r\nnevertheless was sought by all on account of his cleverness. He repaid\r\nthe contempt of his superiors and the adulation of his inferiors by a\r\nmask of impenetrable reserve or scorn. He sought for power and neglected\r\nno means to make himself serviceable to the party whose success appeared\r\nto be imminent. Yet, while appearing to be the servant of the victors,\r\npresent or prospective, he never gave himself to any one party. In this\r\nversatility he resembles Talleyrand, of whom he was a coarse replica.\r\nBoth professed, under all their shifts and turns, to be desirous of\r\nserving France. Talleyrand certainly did so in the sphere of diplomacy;\r\nFouche may occasionally have done so in the sphere of intrigue.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Fouche wrote some political pamphlets and reports, the\r\n  chief of which are _Reflexions sur le jugement de Louis Capet_ (1793);\r\n  _Reflexions sur l'education publique_ (1793); _Rapport et projet de\r\n  loi relatif aux colleges_ (1793); _Rapport sur la situation de\r\n  Commune-Affranchie_ [_Lyons_] (1794); _Lettre aux prefets concernant\r\n  les pretres_, &c. (1801); also the letters of 1815 noted above, and a\r\n  _Lettre au duc de Wellington_ (1817). The best life of Fouche is that\r\n  by L. Madelin, _Fouche_ (2 vols., Paris, 1901). The so-called _Fouche\r\n  Memoirs_ are not genuine, but they were apparently compiled, at least\r\n  in part, from notes written by Fouche, and are often valuable, though\r\n  their account of events (e.g. of the negotiations of 1809-1810) is not\r\n  seldom untrustworthy. For those negotiations see Coquelle, _Napoleon\r\n  et l'Angleterre_ (Paris, 1903, Eng. trans., London, 1904). For the\r\n  plots with which Fouche had to deal see E. Daudet, _La Police et les\r\n  Chouans sous le Consulat et l'Empire_ (Paris, 1895); P.M.C. Desmarest,\r\n  _Temoignages historiques, ou quinze ans de haute police_ (Paris, 1833,\r\n  2nd ed., 1900); E. Picard, _Bonaparte et Moreau_ (Paris, 1905); G.A.\r\n  Thierry, _Conspirateurs et gens de police_; _le complot de libelles_\r\n  (Paris, 1903) (Eng. trans., London, 1903); H.

R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUCHER, SIMON (1644-1696), French philosopher, was born at Dijon on the\r\n1st of March 1644. He was the son of a merchant, and appears to have\r\ntaken orders at a very early age. For some years he held the position of\r\nhonorary canon at Dijon, but this he resigned in order to take up his\r\nresidence in Paris. He graduated at the Sorbonne, and spent the\r\nremainder of his life in literary work in Paris, where he died on the\r\n27th of April 1696. In his day Foucher enjoyed considerable repute as a\r\nkeen opponent of Malebranche. His philosophical standpoint was one of\r\nscepticism in regard to external perception. He revived the old\r\narguments of the Academy, and advanced them with much ingenuity against\r\nMalebranche's doctrine. Otherwise his scepticism is subordinate to\r\northodox belief, the fundamental dogmas of the church seeming to him\r\nintuitively evident. His object was to reconcile his religious with his\r\nphilosophical creed, and to remain a Christian without ceasing to be an\r\nacademician. His writings against Malebranche were collected under the\r\ntitle _Dissertations sur la recherche de la verite_, 1693.\r\n\r\n  See F. Rabbe, _L'Abbe Simon Foucher_ (1867); C. Jourdain in\r\n  _Dictionnaire des sciences philosophiques_ (1875), pp. 557-559.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUCQUET, JEAN, or JEHAN (c. 1415-1485), French painter, born at Tours,\r\nis the most representative and national French painter of the 15th\r\ncentury. Of his life little is known, but it is certain that he was in\r\nItaly about 1437, where he executed the portrait of Pope Eugenius IV.,\r\nand that upon his return to France, whilst retaining his purely French\r\nsentiment, he grafted the elements of the Tuscan style, which he had\r\nacquired during his sojourn in Italy, upon the style of the Van Eycks,\r\nwhich was the basis of early 15th-century French art, and thus became\r\nthe founder of an important new school. He was court painter to Louis\r\nXI. Though his supreme excellence as an illuminator and miniaturist, of\r\nexquisite precision in the rendering of the finest detail, and his power\r\nof clear characterization in work on this minute scale, have long since\r\nprocured him an eminent position in the art of his country, his\r\nimportance as a painter was only realized when his portraits and\r\naltarpieces were for the first time brought together from various parts\r\nof Europe in 1904, at the exhibition of the French Primitives held at\r\nthe Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. One of Foucquet's most important\r\npaintings is the diptych, formerly at Notre Dame de Melun, of which one\r\nwing, depicting Agnes Sorel as the Virgin, is now at the Antwerp Museum\r\nand the other in the Berlin Gallery. The Louvre has his oil portraits of\r\nCharles VII., of Count Wilczek, and of Jouvenal des Ursins, besides a\r\nportrait drawing in crayon; whilst an authentic portrait from his brush\r\nis in the Liechtenstein collection. Far more numerous are his\r\nilluminated books and miniatures that have come down to us. The\r\nBrentano-Laroche collection at Frankfort contains forty miniatures from\r\na Book of Hours, painted in 1461 for Etienne Chevalier who is portrayed\r\nby Foucquet on the Berlin wing of the Melun altarpiece. From Foucquet's\r\nhand again are eleven out of the fourteen miniatures illustrating a\r\ntranslation of Josephus at the Bibliotheque Nationale. The second volume\r\nof this MS., unfortunately with only one of the original thirteen\r\nminiatures, was discovered and bought in 1903 by Mr Henry Yates Thompson\r\nat a London sale, and restored by him to France.\r\n\r\n  See _Oeuvres de Jehan Foucquet_ (Curmer, Paris, 1866-1867); A. de\r\n  Champeaux and P. Gauchery, _Oeuvres d'art executees pour le duc de\r\n  Berry_; \"Facsimiles of two histories by Jean Foucquet\" from vols. i.\r\n  and ii. of the _Anciennetes des Juifs_ (London, 1902); Charles Blanc,\r\n  _Histoire des peintres de toutes les ecoles_ (introduction); and\r\n  Georges Lafenestre, _Jehan Fouquet_ (Paris, 1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUGERES, a town of north-western France, capital of an arrondissement\r\nin the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, 30 m. N.E. of Rennes by rail. Pop.\r\n(1906) 21,847. Fougeres is built on the summit and slopes of a hill on\r\nthe left bank of the Nancon, a tributary of the Couesnon. It was\r\nformerly one of the strongest places on the frontier towards Normandy,\r\nand it still preserves some portions of its medieval fortifications,\r\nnotably a gateway of the 15th century known as the Porte St Sulpice. The\r\ncastle, which is situated in the lower part of the town, directly\r\noverlooking the Nancon, is now a picturesque ruin, but gives abundant\r\nevidence in its towers and outworks of its former strength and\r\nmagnificence. The finest of the towers was erected in 1242 by Hugues of\r\nLusignan, and named after Melusine, the mythical foundress of the\r\nfamily. The churches of St Leonard and St Sulpice both date, at least in\r\npart, from the 15th century. An hotel de ville and a belfry, both of the\r\n15th century, are of architectural interest, and the town possesses many\r\ncurious old houses. There is a statue of General B. de Lari Coisiere (d.\r\n1812), born in the town. Fougeres is the seat of a subprefect, and has a\r\ntribunal of first instance, a chamber of commerce and a communal\r\ncollege. It is the chief industrial town of its department, being a\r\ncentre for the manufacture of boots and shoes; tanning and\r\nleather-dressing and the manufacture of sail-cloth and other fabrics\r\nare also important industries. Trade is in dairy produce and in the\r\ngranite of the neighbouring quarries. Fougeres frequently figures in\r\nBreton history from the 11th to the 15th century. It was taken by the\r\nEnglish in 1166, and again in 1448; and the name of Surienne, the captor\r\non the second occasion, is still borne by one of the towers of the\r\ncastle. In 1488 it was taken by the troops of Charles VIII. under la\r\nTremoille. In the middle ages Fougeres was a lordship of some\r\nimportance, which in the 13th century passed into the possession of the\r\nfamily of Lusignan, and in 1307 was confiscated by the crown and\r\nafterwards changed hands many times. In 1793, during the wars of the\r\nVendee, it was occupied by the insurgents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUILLEE, ALFRED JULES EMILE (1838-   ), French philosopher, was born at\r\nLa Poueze on the 18th of October 1838. He held several minor\r\nphilosophical lectureships, and from 1864 was professor of philosophy at\r\nthe lycees of Douai, Montpellier and Bordeaux successively. In 1867 and\r\n1868 he was crowned by the Academy of Moral Science for his work on\r\nPlato and Socrates. In 1872 he was elected master of conferences at the\r\nEcole Normale, and was made doctor of philosophy in recognition of his\r\ntwo treatises, _Platonis Hippias Minor sive Socratica contra liberum\r\narbitrium argumenta_ and _La Liberte et le determinisme_. The strain of\r\nthe next three years' continuous work undermined his health and his\r\neyesight, and he was compelled to retire from his professorship. During\r\nthese years he had published works on Plato and Socrates and a history\r\nof philosophy (1875); but after his retirement he further developed his\r\nphilosophical position, a speculative eclecticism through which he\r\nendeavoured to reconcile metaphysical idealism with the naturalistic and\r\nmechanical standpoint of science. In _L'Evolutionnisme des idees-forces_\r\n(1890), _La Psychologie des idees-forces_ (1893), and _La Morale des\r\nidees-forces_ (1907), is elaborated his doctrine of _idees-forces_, or\r\nof mind as efficient cause through the tendency of ideas to realize\r\nthemselves in appropriate movement. Ethical and sociological\r\ndevelopments of this theory succeed its physical and psychological\r\ntreatment, the consideration of the antinomy of freedom being especially\r\nimportant. Fouillee's wife, who by a previous marriage was the mother of\r\nthe poet and philosopher Jean Marie Guyau (1854-1888), is well known,\r\nunder the pseudonym of \"G. Bruno,\" as the author of educational books\r\nfor children.\r\n\r\n  His other chief works are: _L'Idee moderne du droit en Allemagne, en\r\n  Angleterre et en France_ (Paris, 1878); _La Science sociale\r\n  contemporaine_ (1880); _La Propriete sociale et la democratie_ (1884);\r\n  _Critique des systemes de morale contemporains_ (1883); _La Morale,\r\n  l'art et la religion d'apres Guyau_ (1889); _L'Avenir de la\r\n  metaphysique fondee sur l'experience_ (1889); _L'Enseignement au point\r\n  de vue national_ (1891); _Descartes_ (1893); _Temperament et\r\n  caractere_ (2nd ed., 1895); _Le Mouvement positiviste et la conception\r\n  sociologique du monde_ (1896); _Le Mouvement idealiste et la reaction\r\n  contre la science positive_ (1896); _La Psychologie du peuple\r\n  francais_ (2nd ed., 1898); _La France au point de vue moral_ (1900);\r\n  _L'Esquisse psychologique des peuples europeens_ (1903); _Nietzsche et\r\n  l' \"immoralisme\"_ (1903); _Le Moralisme de Kant_ (1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOULD, ACHILLE (1800-1867), French financier and politician, was born at\r\nParis on the 17th of November 1800. The son of a rich Jewish banker, he\r\nwas associated with and afterwards succeeded his father in the\r\nmanagement of the business. As early as 1842 he entered political life,\r\nhaving been elected in that year as a deputy for the department of the\r\nHautes Pyrenees. From that time to his death he actively busied himself\r\nwith the affairs of his country. He readily acquiesced in the revolution\r\nof February 1848, and is said to have exercised a decided influence in\r\nfinancial matters on the provisional government then formed. He shortly\r\nafterwards published two pamphlets against the use of paper money,\r\nentitled, _Pas d'Assignats!_ and _Observations sur la question\r\nfinanciere_. During the presidency of Louis Napoleon he was four times\r\nminister of finance, and took a leading part in the economical reforms\r\nthen made in France. His strong conservative tendencies led him to\r\noppose the doctrine of free trade, and disposed him to hail the _coup\r\nd'etat_ and the new empire. On the 25th of January 1852, in consequence\r\nof the decree confiscating the property of the Orleans family, he\r\nresigned the office of minister of finance, but was on the same day\r\nappointed senator, and soon after rejoined the government as minister of\r\nstate and of the imperial household. In this capacity he directed the\r\nParis exhibition of 1855. The events of November 1860 led once more to\r\nhis resignation, but he was recalled to the ministry of finance in\r\nNovember of the following year, and retained office until the\r\npublication of the imperial letter of the 19th of January 1867, when\r\nEmile Ollivier became the chief adviser of the emperor. During his last\r\ntenure of office he had reduced the floating debt, which the Mexican war\r\nhad considerably increased, by the negotiation of a loan of 300 millions\r\nof francs (1863). Fould, besides uncommon financial abilities, had a\r\ntaste for the fine arts, which he developed and refined during his youth\r\nby visiting Italy and the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean. In 1857\r\nhe was made a member of the Academy of the Fine Arts. He died at Tarbes\r\non the 5th of October 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOULIS, ANDREW (1712-1775) and ROBERT (1707-1776), Scottish printers and\r\npublishers, were the sons of a Glasgow maltman. Robert was apprenticed\r\nto a barber; but his ability attracted the attention of Dr Francis\r\nHutcheson, who strongly recommended him to establish a printing press.\r\nAfter spending 1738 and 1739 in England and France in company with his\r\nbrother Andrew, who had been intended for the church and had received a\r\nbetter education, he started business in 1741 in Glasgow, and in 1743\r\nwas appointed printer to the university. In this same year he brought\r\nout _Demetrius Phalereus de elocutione_, in Greek and Latin, the first\r\nGreek book ever printed in Glasgow; and this was followed in 1774 by the\r\nfamous 12mo edition of Horace which was long but erroneously believed to\r\nbe immaculate: though the successive sheets were exposed in the\r\nuniversity and a reward offered for the discovery of any inaccuracy, six\r\nerrors at least, according to T.F. Dibdin, escaped detection. Soon\r\nafterwards the brothers entered into partnership, and they continued for\r\nabout thirty years to issue carefully corrected and beautifully printed\r\neditions of classical works in Latin, Greek, English, French and\r\nItalian. They printed more than five hundred separate publications,\r\namong them the small editions of Cicero, Tacitus, Cornelius Nepos,\r\nVirgil, Tibullus and Propertius, Lucretius and Juvenal; a beautiful\r\nedition of the Greek Testament, in small 4to; Homer (4 vols. fol.,\r\n1756-1758); Herodotus, Greek and Latin (9 vols. 12mo, 1761); Xenophon,\r\nGreek and Latin (12 vols. 12mo, 1762-1767); Gray's Poems; Pope's Works;\r\nMilton's Poems. The Homer, for which Flaxman's designs were executed, is\r\nperhaps the most famous production of the Foulis press. The brothers\r\nspared no pains, and Robert went to France to procure manuscripts of the\r\nclassics, and to engage a skilled engraver and a copper-plate printer.\r\nUnfortunately it became their ambition to establish an institution for\r\nthe encouragement of the fine arts; and though one of their chief\r\npatrons, the earl of Northumberland, warned them to \"print for posterity\r\nand prosper,\" they spent their money in collecting pictures, pieces of\r\nsculpture and models, in paying for the education and travelling of\r\nyouthful artists, and in copying the masterpieces of foreign art. Their\r\ncountrymen were not ripe for such an attempt, and the \"Academy\" not only\r\nproved a failure but involved the projectors in ruin. Andrew died on the\r\n18th of September 1775, and his brother went to London, hoping to\r\nrealize a large sum by the sale of his pictures. They were sold for much\r\nless than he anticipated, and Robert returned broken-hearted to\r\nScotland, where he died at Edinburgh on the 2nd of June 1776. Robert was\r\nthe author of a _Catalogue of Paintings with Critical Remarks_. The\r\nbusiness was afterwards carried on under the same name by Robert's son\r\nAndrew.\r\n\r\n  See W.J. Duncan, _Notices and Documents illustrative of the Literary\r\n  History of Glasgow_, printed for the Maitland Club (1831), which\r\n  _inter alia_ contains a catalogue of the works printed at the Foulis\r\n  press, and another of the pictures, statues and busts in plaster of\r\n  Paris produced at the \"Academy\" in the university of Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOULLON, JOSEPH FRANCOIS (1717-1789), French administrator, was born at\r\nSaumur. During the Seven Years' War he was intendant-general of the\r\narmies, and intendant of the army and navy under Marshal de Belle-Isle.\r\nIn 1771 he was appointed intendant of finances. In 1789, when Necker\r\nwas dismissed, Foullon was appointed minister of the king's household,\r\nand was thought of by the reactionary party as a substitute. But he was\r\nunpopular on all sides. The farmers-general detested him on account of\r\nhis severity, the Parisians on account of his wealth accumulated in\r\nutter indifference to the sufferings of the poor; he was reported,\r\nprobably quite without foundation, to have said, \"If the people cannot\r\nget bread, let them eat hay.\" After the taking of the Bastille on the\r\n14th of July, he withdrew to his estate at Vitry and attempted to spread\r\nthe news of his death; but he was recognized, taken to Paris, carried\r\noff with a bundle of hay tied to his back to the hotel de ville, and, in\r\nspite of the intervention of Lafayette, was dragged out by the populace\r\nand hanged to a lamp-post on the 22nd of July 1789.\r\n\r\n  See Eugene Bonnemere, _Histoire des paysans_ (4th ed., 1887), tome\r\n  iii.; C.L. Chassin, _Les Elections et les cahiers de Paris en 1789_.\r\n  (Paris, 1889), tomes iii. and iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION (Lat. _fundatio_, from _fundare_, to found), the act of\r\nbuilding, constituting or instituting on a permanent basis; especially\r\nthe establishing of any institution by endowing or providing it with\r\nfunds for its continual maintenance. The word is thus applied also to\r\nthe institutions so established, such as a college, monastery or\r\nhospital; and the terms \"on the foundation,\" or \"foundationer,\" are used\r\nof members of such a college or society who enjoy, as fellows, scholars,\r\n&c., the benefits of the endowment. Formerly \"foundation\" also meant the\r\ncharter or incorporation of any such institution or society, and it is\r\nstill applied to the funds used for the endowment of such institutions.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"old foundation\" and \"new foundation\" used in connexion with\r\nthe organizing of English cathedral chapters have no reference to the\r\nage of the cathedrals. At the time of the Reformation under Henry VIII.\r\nthe old college chapters were left unchanged, and are referred to as the\r\n\"old foundations,\" but the monastic chapters were all suppressed,\r\nconsequently new chapters had to be formed for their cathedrals and\r\nthese constitute the \"new foundations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foundation\" also means the base (natural or artificial) on which any\r\nerection is built up; generally made below the level of the ground (see\r\nFOUNDATIONS below). A foundation-stone is one of the stones at the base\r\nof a building, generally a corner-stone, frequently laid with a public\r\nceremony to celebrate the commencement of the building. The term is also\r\napplied to the ground-work of any structure, such as, in dress-making,\r\nthe underskirt over which the real skirt is hung, any material used for\r\nstiffening purposes, as \"foundation muslin or net.\" In knitting or\r\ncrochet the first stitches onto which all the rest are worked are called\r\nthe \"foundation chain.\" In gem-cutting the \"foundation-square\" is the\r\nfirst of eight squares round the edges of a brilliant made in bevel\r\nplanes and from which the angles are all removed to form three-corner\r\nfacets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATIONS, in building. The object of foundations is to distribute the\r\nweight of a structure equally over the ground. In the construction of a\r\nbuilding the weights are concentrated at given points on piers, columns,\r\n&c., and these foundations require to be spread so as to reduce the\r\nweight to an average. In the preparation of a foundation care must be\r\ntaken to prevent the lateral escape of the soil or the movement of a bed\r\nupon sloping ground, and it is also necessary to provide against any\r\ndamage by the action of the atmosphere. The soils met with in ordinary\r\npractice, such as rock, gravel, chalk, clay and sand, vary as to their\r\ncapabilities of bearing weight. There is no provision in any English\r\nbuilding acts as to the load that may be placed on any of these soils,\r\nbut under the New York Building Code it is provided that, where no test\r\nof the sustaining power of the soil is made, different soils, excluding\r\nmud, at the bottom of the footings shall be deemed to safely sustain the\r\nfollowing loads to the superficial foot:\r\n\r\n                                                      per sq. ft.\r\n  Soft clay                                             1 ton.\r\n  Ordinary soft clay and sand, together in layers,\r\n    wet and springy                                     2 tons.\r\n  Loam, clay or fine sand, firm and dry                 3 tons.\r\n  Very firm coarse sand, stiff gravel or hard clay      4 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Load on foundation.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the pressure exerted on an ordinary foundation by the\r\nwalls of the several thicknesses and heights provided for by the London\r\nBuilding Act of 1894, and a comparison of a few of the principal\r\nauthorities, will be found useful in helping us to arrive at a decision\r\nas to what can safely be allowed. Take as an example a wall of the\r\nwarehouse class, 70 ft. high, whose section at the base for a height of\r\n27 ft. is 2-1/2 bricks thick (or 22-1/2 in.), and for the same distance\r\nin height again is 2 bricks thick (or 18 in.), the remainder to the top\r\nbeing 1-1/2 bricks thick (or 14 in.). The weight of brickwork per foot\r\nrun of such a wall is 4.05 tons on any area of 3.75 ft. super. of\r\nbrickwork. According to the act the concrete is to project 4 in. on each\r\nside; we have then an additional area of .66 ft. super. to add, thus\r\nmaking the total foundation area of each foot run of wall 4.41 ft.\r\nsuper. to take a weight of 4.05 tons or nearly a ton per foot super.\r\n(viz. .9 ton.)\r\n\r\nAnother factor must, however, be taken into consideration, viz. the\r\nweight distributed from the loaded floor and from the roof. In this case\r\nthere would be at least six floors, and the entire weight could hardly\r\nbe taken at less than 6 tons, which would give a total weight of 10.05\r\ntons on an area of 4.41 ft. super. or a load of 2.28 tons per foot\r\nsuper. This is on the assumption that no extra weight has been thrown on\r\nthe foundations by openings or piers, or by girders, &c., in which case,\r\nin addition to the work being executed in cement, the foundations should\r\nbe increased in area. Piers always involve a great increase of weight on\r\nthe foundations, and in very many instances this increased weight,\r\ninstead of being provided for by increasing the area of the foundations\r\nand so reducing the weight per foot super., is only partly met by the\r\nimproper method of merely increasing the depth of the concrete, while\r\nkeeping the same projection of concrete round the footings as for the\r\nwalls. As an example take an iron column to carry a safe load of 80\r\ntons, standing on a York stone template, and in turn supported by a\r\nbrick pier 22-1/2 in. square. In this case we should have, after allowing\r\nfor the projection of concrete on either side, an area of 4 ft. 5 in.\r\nsquare, or 19.6 ft. super., and this would give a pressure of 4.1 tons\r\nper foot on the foundations, or almost twice as much as in the previous\r\nexample of a warehouse wall. Here, instead of increasing the depth of\r\nthe concrete, it would be necessary to increase its width; if it were\r\nmade 6 ft. square, we should have an area of 36 ft. super. to take the\r\n80 tons, and thus the pressure would only be 2.2 tons per foot, and the\r\ncost of the foundation be much the same.\r\n\r\nIf we compare a section of wall of the dwelling-house class, as\r\nprescribed by the London Building Act, we find that, taking a wall 50\r\nft. high and having a thickness at base of 22-1/2 in. as for the\r\nwarehouse wall to which we have referred, we have a wall weighing 3.75\r\ntons per foot super. on an area of 4.41 feet super., or .85 ton per foot\r\nwithout weight of floors and roof as against the .9 ton in the warehouse\r\nexample. To this must be added the weight of, say, 5 floors and roof at\r\na total of 3 tons per foot run of wall, and we then have an aggregate of\r\n6.75 tons per foot run and 1.50 tons per foot super. as against 2.28\r\ntons in the warehouse class.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the act to text-books we find that Colonel Seddon in the\r\n_Aide Memoir_ gives the load which ordinary foundations will bear as a\r\nsafe load per foot super. as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                         tons.\r\n  Rock, moderately hard                                   9\r\n  Rock of strength of good concrete                       3\r\n  Rock, very soft                                       1.8\r\n  Firm earth                                             1 to 1-1/2\r\n  Hard clay                                              1 to 1-1/2\r\n  Clean dry gravel and clean sharp sand prevented from\r\n    spreading sideways                                   1 to 1-1/2\r\n\r\nMost of the work in London may be classed under one of the latter heads,\r\nand according to this table we have, when we erect walls in accordance\r\nwith the building act, to overload our foundations.\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility of spreading weights, we have as an example the\r\nchimney at Adkin's Soap Works in Birmingham, 312 ft. high, so arranged\r\nthat its pressure on the foundations is only 1-1/2 tons per foot super.;\r\nalso the great St Rollox chimney at Glasgow, which has a pressure of\r\n1-3/4 tons; the weight of the Eiffel Tower (7500 tons) is so spread over\r\n4 bases, each 130 ft. square, that the pressure is only .117 ton, or\r\n2-1/3 cwt., per foot super. The Tower Bridge has a load of 16 tons per\r\nfoot on the granite bed under the columns of towers, reduced by\r\nspreading to an actual pressure on the clay foundation of 4 tons. The\r\npiers under the Holborn Viaduct have a load of 2-1/4 tons only, those of\r\nthe Imperial Institute 2-1/4 tons, and those of the destructor cells and\r\nchimney shaft at Great Yarmouth 4 tons 6-3/4 cwt. per foot super. From\r\nthese various examples it would appear that on sound clay or gravel\r\nfoundation a load of from 2-1/4 to 4 tons may be employed with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Trial borings.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most important requirements in preparing drawings\r\nfor a large building is to ascertain the nature of the subsoil and\r\nstrata at different levels over the proposed site, so as to be able to\r\narrange the footings accordingly at the various depths and to decide as\r\nto the various forms and methods to be employed. For this purpose trial\r\nholes or borings are sunk until a suitable bed or bottom is found, upon\r\nwhich the concrete foundation may safely be put. If no such solid bottom\r\nis found, as often happens near the water side, special foundations must\r\nbe employed, such as dock, gridiron, cantilever and pile foundations,\r\n&c., all of which will be described hereafter. As examples of the\r\nvarying subsoils we may mention the following, in which will be noticed\r\nthe great depths dug before getting through the made ground: At the Bank\r\nof England there were 22 ft. of made ground resting on 4 ft. of gravel.\r\nSome of the made ground was of ancient date, and preserved relics of\r\nRoman occupation. In some parts the subsoils have been excavated for\r\nballast or gravel, as at Kensington, or for brick earth, as at Highbury,\r\nand the pits filled in with rubbish. Rock, which forms an excellent and\r\nunchanging foundation in one situation, may prove a dangerous foundation\r\nin another. Thus chalk forms a good limestone foundation in certain\r\npositions, but when it dips towards a slope or a cliff with an outcrop\r\nof the gault or underlying clay, it is a very unsuitable foundation for\r\nany building, as the landslips in the Isle of Wight and on the\r\nDorsetshire coast bear witness. A boring made in Tallis Street, near the\r\nThames embankment, showed: (1) 18 in. ballast, dirty; (2) 6 in.\r\ngreensand, wet and dirty; (3) 2 ft. peat clay; (4) 6 in. greensand; (5)\r\n5-1/2 ft. peaty bog; (6) 9 ft. running sand; and (7) 4 ft. clean\r\nballast, resting at a depth of 23 ft. below the ground line upon blue\r\nclay. A boring at Highbury New Park gave: (1) 2 ft. made ground, (2) 18\r\nft. loam, (3) 9 ft. sand, (4) 4 ft. peat, and (5) 8 ft. gravel and sand.\r\nThese examples show that while trial holes should always be made before\r\ndesigning a foundation, to ascertain the nature of the subsoil, care\r\nmust be taken not to calculate upon uniformity. Thus at the block 2 of\r\nthe admiralty extension new buildings (London), one of the trial holes\r\nupon the south-west side of the old buildings showed the clay to be\r\nabout 29-1/2 ft. below the surface of the ground, while actual\r\nexcavation proved the dip of the clay to be such that in the execution\r\nof the new building it became necessary to underpin the north-west\r\ncorner of the old building at the deepest part 42 ft. below the ground.\r\nThe foundations of block 1 of the new admiralty buildings are placed in\r\na dock, built upon the London clay at a depth of 30 ft. in solid\r\nconcrete 6 ft. thick. At the Hotel Victoria, in Northumberland Avenue\r\n(London), the various subsoils are as follows: (1) 38-1/2 ft. made\r\nground clay and gravel mixed, (2) 4 ft. gravel and sand, (3) 6 ft.\r\nrising sand; (4) 2 ft. fine ballast, and at a depth of 50 ft. blue clay.\r\nAt the south end the clay was 43 ft. down and at the north end 37 ft.\r\nThe front wall was constructed on a concrete bed 9 ft. wide. The site\r\nwas surrounded by a similar wall of concrete about 6 ft. wide, forming a\r\nspecies of boxes, and the whole was covered with a depth of 6 ft. of\r\nconcrete upon which the walls were raised. The foundation for 53\r\nParliament Street, where running sand was encountered, was constructed\r\nwith short piles, 7 or 8 ft. long and 6 in. diam., pointed and placed as\r\nclose together as possible over the whole foundation, the tops were then\r\nsawn off level, and a concrete raft, 7 or 8 ft. thick, was built over\r\nthe whole area. At the Institution of Civil Engineers, Great George\r\nStreet, Westminster, the foundations to the two party walls upon each\r\nside of the building were carried down about 22 ft. below the pavement\r\nlevel, that on the west side being 22 ft. deep and that on the east side\r\n24 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Construction.\r\n\r\n  The London Building Act and the model by-laws prohibit the erection of\r\n  buildings on sites that have been used as \"shoots\" for faecal matter\r\n  or vegetable refuse, and in such cases the objectionable material must\r\n  be removed prior to the commencement of building operations, and the\r\n  holes from which it was taken filled up with dry brick or other\r\n  rubbish well rammed. Foundations are usually executed by excavators or\r\n  navvies, and the tools and implements used are boning rods, level\r\n  pegs, lines, spirit level, pickaxe, various shovels, wheel-barrow,\r\n  rammer or punner, &c. In digging the ordinary trenches and\r\n  excavations, should the ground be loose, planking and strutting have\r\n  to be employed. This consists of rough boarding put along the sides of\r\n  the trenches and wedged tight with waling pieces and struts; this work\r\n  is done by navvies. Figs. 1 and 2 show the general forms of planking\r\n  and strutting for the different soils.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n  In very large works of excavation in soft soil a steam digger is used\r\n  for the bulk of the work. It consists of a large steel bucket with a\r\n  cutting edge; this is lowered by means of a crane into the excavation,\r\n  and on being withdrawn cuts off a portion of soil which is hoisted and\r\n  deposited in carts for removal to any desired position within the\r\n  radius commanded by the crane. The work of trimming the excavation to\r\n  a regular shape must always be done by manual labour.\r\n\r\n  Concrete for filling into the foundations is usually mixed by navvies;\r\n  for large works it is sometimes mixed by machinery.\r\n\r\n  In order that the work of excavating and constructing the foundations\r\n  may proceed in a water-logged site, pumps have to be employed, and\r\n  where the inrush of water is great it is usual to sink a sump hole\r\n  lower than the depth required for the foundations, and to use a steam\r\n  pump kept going day and night.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n  The foundation of a wall is required to be as follows in accordance\r\n  with the London Building and Amendment Acts: \"The projection of the\r\n  bottom of the footings of every wall on each side of the wall shall be\r\n  at least equal to half of the thickness of the wall at its base,\r\n  unless an adjoining wall interferes, in which case the projection may\r\n  be omitted where that wall adjoins, and the diminution of the footings\r\n  of every wall shall be formed in regular offsets and the height from\r\n  the bottom of such footing to the base of the wall shall be at least\r\n  equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the wall at its base.\" (See\r\n  BRICKWORK.) The base of a wall is the thickness above the footing; the\r\n  footing is the brickwork built directly on the top of the concrete and\r\n  diminishing in width in every course. Thus: \"The projection of the\r\n  bottom footing to be equal to one-half the thickness of wall on both\r\n  sides\" means that a 13-1/2-in. wall would require to have three courses\r\n  of footings, the bottom one being 27 in. wide. \"The height from the\r\n  bottom of such footing to the base of the wall shall be at least equal\r\n  to two-thirds the thickness of wall at its base\" means that in the\r\n  case of a 13-1/2-in. wall the height of footings would have to be 9 in.,\r\n  or three courses of brickwork, each measuring 3 in.\r\n\r\n  The New York Building Code enters more fully into the requirements for\r\n  the foundation of walls as regards depth than that in use in London.\r\n  Section 25, Part 5, requires that every building, except buildings\r\n  erected upon solid rock, or upon wharves and piers on the water front,\r\n  shall have foundations of brick, stone, iron or concrete laid not less\r\n  then 4 ft. below the surface of the earth, on the solid ground or\r\n  level surface of rock, or upon piles or ranging timbers when solid\r\n  earth or rock is not found. Piles intended to sustain a wall, pier or\r\n  post, shall be spaced not more than 36 in. nor less than 20 in. on\r\n  centres; they must be driven to a solid bearing if practicable, and\r\n  their number must be sufficient to support the superstructure\r\n  proposed. No pile shall be used of less dimensions than 5 in. at the\r\n  small end and 10 in. at the butt for short piles, or piles 20 ft. or\r\n  less in length. No pile shall be weighted with a load exceeding 40,000\r\n  lb. When a pile is not driven to refusal, its safe sustaining power\r\n  shall be determined by the following formula: twice the weight of the\r\n  hammer in tons multiplied by the height of the fall in feet divided by\r\n  the least penetration of pile under the last blow in inches plus one.\r\n  There are also further requirements as to piles, &c., and the\r\n  commissioner of buildings must be notified when the piles are to be\r\n  driven.\r\n\r\n  The New York Code, Section 26, further goes on to say that foundation\r\n  walls shall be constructed to include all walls and piers built below\r\n  the curb level or nearest tier of beams to the curb, to serve as\r\n  supports for the walls, piers, columns, girders, posts or beams.\r\n  Foundation walls shall be built of stone, brick, Portland cement\r\n  concrete, iron or steel. If built of rubble stone or Portland cement\r\n  concrete, they shall be at least 8 in. thicker than the wall above\r\n  them to a depth of 12 ft. below the curb level, and for every\r\n  additional 10 ft. or part thereof deeper, they shall be increased 4\r\n  in. in thickness. If built of brick, they shall be at least 4 in.\r\n  thicker than the wall next above them to a depth of 12 ft. below the\r\n  curb level, and for every additional 10 ft. or part thereof deeper,\r\n  they shall be increased 4 in. in thickness. The footing or base course\r\n  shall be of stone or concrete, or both, or of concrete and stepped up\r\n  brickwork of sufficient thickness and area to bear safely the weight\r\n  to be imposed thereon. If the footing or base course be of concrete,\r\n  the concrete shall not be less than 12 in. thick; if of stone, the\r\n  stones shall not be less than 2 X 3 ft. and at least 8 in. in thickness\r\n  for walls, and not less than 10 in. in thickness if under piers,\r\n  columns or posts. The footing or base course, whether formed of\r\n  concrete or stone, shall be at least 12 in. wider than the bottom\r\n  width of walls, and at least 12 in. wider on all sides than the bottom\r\n  width of said piers, columns or posts. If the superimposed load is\r\n  such as to cause undue transverse strain on a footing projecting 12\r\n  in., the thickness of such footing is to be increased so as to carry\r\n  the load with safety. For small structures and for small piers\r\n  sustaining light loads the commissioner of buildings having\r\n  jurisdiction may, in his discretion, allow a reduction in the\r\n  thickness and projection specified for footing or base courses. All\r\n  base stones shall be bedded and laid crosswise, edge to edge. If\r\n  stepped-up footing of brick is used in place of stone above the\r\n  concrete, the offsets if laid in single courses shall each not exceed\r\n  1-1/2 in., or, if laid in double courses, then each shall not exceed 3\r\n  in. offsetting the first course of brickwork back one-half the\r\n  thickness of the concrete base, so as properly to distribute the load\r\n  to be imposed thereon. It will be seen by the foregoing that the\r\n  American acts are far more extensive than in London. The London\r\n  Building Act mentions that the footings of a wall shall rest upon the\r\n  solid ground or concrete or upon other solid substructure. The\r\n  building act amendment says: \"The foundations of the walls of every\r\n  house or building shall be formed of a bed of good concrete not less\r\n  than 9 in. thick, and projecting at least 4 in. on each side of the\r\n  lowest course of footings.\"\r\n\r\n  _Various Types of Foundations._--The most natural foundations for\r\n  walls are those constructed where the walls are built directly upon\r\n  the ground; this is only possible where the ground is very hard or\r\n  consists of rock, and in either of these cases the ground is simply\r\n  levelled and the building commenced.\r\n\r\n  The next and most universally recognized method, which might safely be\r\n  said to be adopted in 95% of all modern buildings, is the system of\r\n  placing a bed of concrete under the walls, digging trenches where the\r\n  walls are to come until a solid bottom is reached, and in these laying\r\n  the concrete. The London Building Act requires this concrete bed to be\r\n  at least 4 in. wider than the bottom course of footings on each side\r\n  of the wall, but it is generally made 6 in. wider on each side and in\r\n  general circumstances the depth of the concrete is varied according to\r\n  the weight placed upon it.\r\n\r\n  Where a site is in close proximity to a river or old water-course,\r\n  &c., where deep basements are excavated, or where the ground lies low,\r\n  naturally water is met with, and where water is the ground is soft. It\r\n  is here that special foundations are required.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Concrete piers, legs, or stilts.\r\n\r\n  In certain cases it is necessary to use concrete legs or stilts. These\r\n  are placed in such positions as to take the weights of the building,\r\n  and sunk to depths of 40 ft. more or less as the case may require\r\n  according to the nature of the ground; and on the tops of these stilts\r\n  concrete arches or lintels are turned over (fig. 3). As an example of\r\n  the stilt principle, mention may be made of some premises at Stratford\r\n  and a church at South Bermondsey, London, in which concrete piers were\r\n  sunk at 12 ft. centres apart and 4-1/2 ft. square, in pot holes dug\r\n  out of made ground; then concrete arches were formed over the\r\n  intervening untrustworthy ground with a minimum thickness of 18 in. or\r\n  the piers were connected by concrete lintels 3 ft. thick in which\r\n  steel joists were embedded. At Sion College, Victoria Embankment,\r\n  London, the foundations were formed with cement concrete stilts or\r\n  piers 8 ft. square, and going down to the London clay; from the tops\r\n  of these stilts brick arches were turned, spanning the spaces between\r\n  the piers, and upon these arches the walls were built.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pile foundations.\r\n\r\n  Pile foundations, used in the case of soft ground, for small works,\r\n  consist either of stout scaffold poles or of timbers varying from 6\r\n  in. to 12 in. square according to requirements (fig. 4). The bottom\r\n  ends of these timbers have an iron shoe with a point, so as to be\r\n  easily driven into the ground, and the tops of the timbers have an\r\n  iron band round, so that when the timbers are being driven in the\r\n  band prevents them from splitting (fig. 5). The methods of driving\r\n  these piles are various. The usual plan is to erect a temporary\r\n  structure, upon one side of which is a guide path faced with\r\n  sheet-iron so as to give a smooth face. Up and down this guide path a\r\n  heavy iron weight, called a monkey, is worked; the monkey is hoisted\r\n  to the top of the guide path by means of a crab worked by hand or\r\n  steam, and when released descends with a good force, and so drives the\r\n  piles into the ground. The monkey usually weighs from 2 cwt. to 10\r\n  cwt. and is allowed a drop of 15 to 40 ft.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n  Piles are driven all round under the walls at varying intervals or\r\n  under piers where the weights of a building are to be concentrated. In\r\n  the erection of the Chicago public library four Norway pine piles,\r\n  each with an average diameter of 13 in., were driven to a depth of\r\n  52-1/2 ft. and loaded with a dead load of 50.7 tons per pile for a\r\n  period of two weeks, and no settlement taking place 30 tons per pile\r\n  was adopted as a safe load. The following are some examples of loads\r\n  used in practice: passenger station, Harrison Street, Chicago, piles\r\n  50 ft. in length, each carrying 25 tons; elevator, Buffalo, N.Y.,\r\n  piles 20 ft. in length, weight 25 tons; Trinity church, Boston, 2\r\n  tons; Schiller building, Chicago, 55 tons per pile, but in this case\r\n  the building settled considerably. All timber grillage and the tops of\r\n  all piles should be kept below the lowest water level, and be capped\r\n  with concrete or stone. In Boston it is obligatory to cap with blocks\r\n  of granite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Concrete piles.\r\n\r\n  Another form of foundation takes the shape of Portland cement concrete\r\n  blocks, and is used chiefly for bridges and in marshy land, &c. In\r\n  some cases cylinders of brickwork are built, and the centres are\r\n  filled with blocks of concrete and grouted in. The Yarmouth destructor\r\n  cells and chimney shaft were built in this way; the cylinders were\r\n  constructed of 9 in. brickwork built in Portland cement, the lower 4\r\n  ft. being encased in a wooden drum with cutting edge sunk into the\r\n  gravel and sand at least 2 ft. The cylinders were sunk by the aid of\r\n  a grab, the bottom being levelled and the concrete blocks laid by a\r\n  diver. Use is also made of piles consisting of Portland cement\r\n  concrete having steel rods embedded in it, and provided with iron\r\n  shoes and head for driving (fig. 6).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n  Cast iron screw piles (fig. 7) used in very loose sandy soils, consist\r\n  of large hollow cast iron columns with flat screw blades cast on the\r\n  lower ends. The projection of this screw from the pile may vary from 9\r\n  in. to 18 in. with a pitch of from one-quarter to one-half of the\r\n  projection, the blade making a little over one turn round the shaft.\r\n  For most requirements a diameter of screw from 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 ft. will\r\n  be found sufficient, a sandy foundation requiring the largest. The\r\n  lower end of the tube is generally left open, the edge being bevelled\r\n  and occasionally provided with teeth to assist in cutting into and\r\n  penetrating the soil.\r\n\r\n  Another system of piling known as sheet piling (fig. 8), consists in\r\n  driving piles into the ground at intervals, and between these, also\r\n  driven into the ground, are timbers measuring 3 in. by 9 in., which\r\n  form a wall to keep the soft earth up under the building. In this way\r\n  the earth is prevented from spreading out and so causing the building\r\n  to settle unevenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Plank foundations.\r\n\r\n  Another kind of foundation, known as plank foundation (fig. 9),\r\n  consists of elm planks, about 9 in. by 3 in. laid across the trench\r\n  and spiked together; on the top of these are laid similar planks but\r\n  at right angles to the last, and upon the platform thus formed the\r\n  wall is built. This method is used in soft ground.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Caissons.\r\n\r\n  Caissons are usually employed by engineers for the construction of the\r\n  foundations of bridge piers, but instances of their use in foundations\r\n  for buildings are to be found in the American Surety and the Manhattan\r\n  Life Insurance buildings, New York City. The latter building is 242\r\n  ft. high to the parapet, and the dome and tower rise 108 ft. higher.\r\n  The building is carried on 16 solid masonry piers, taken down 54 ft.\r\n  below the street level to solid rock, and these piers support the 34\r\n  cast iron columns upon which the building is erected. The piers to\r\n  each building were constructed by the pneumatic caisson process (see\r\n  CAISSON).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Well foundations.\r\n\r\n  A good plan for foundations when the ground is loose and sandy is to\r\n  build upon wells of brickwork, a method which has been successfully\r\n  practised in Madras. The wells are made circular, about 3 ft. in\r\n  diameter and one brick thick. The first course is laid and cemented\r\n  together on the surface of the ground when it is dry, and the earth is\r\n  excavated inside and round about it to allow it to sink. Then another\r\n  is laid over it and again sunk. The well is thus built downwards. The\r\n  brickwork is sunk bodily to a depth of 10 ft. or more, according to\r\n  building to be erected upon it, and the interior is filled up with\r\n  rubble work. All the public buildings at Madras were erected upon\r\n  foundations of this kind. Well foundations were employed under the\r\n  city hall, Kansas City, and the Stock Exchange, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Coffer dams.\r\n\r\n  Coffer dams are wooden structures used to keep back the water whilst\r\n  putting in foundations on the waterside, and are constructed with two\r\n  rows of timbers, 12 in. square as piles spaced about 6 ft. apart, and\r\n  filled in between with a double row of 2 in. or 3 in. boards, the\r\n  space between the rows being packed with clay puddle (fig. 10). The\r\n  general rule for the thickness of a coffer dam is to make it equal to\r\n  the depth of water. An interesting example of a coffer dam is that at\r\n  the Keyham dock extension, where piles varied in length from 65 ft. to\r\n  85 ft. They were driven in a double row 5 ft. apart, and over 13,000\r\n  were used.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dock foundations.\r\n\r\n  Dock foundations are constructed after the fashion of a large concrete\r\n  tank, and are adapted to large sites where a difficulty arises as to\r\n  the ingress of water. They are considered the best method of\r\n  constructing a building on soft ground and of keeping a building dry\r\n  (fig. 11). This type of foundation was used at the new colonial\r\n  office, Whitehall, London, and the new admiralty buildings at St\r\n  James's Park, London. A few buildings treated after the style of a\r\n  dock, but in some instances without the enclosing walls, are the\r\n  following: At the admiralty buildings already mentioned a concrete\r\n  retaining wall completely surrounds the exterior below the ground, and\r\n  is joined up to the underpinning work; the whole site being covered\r\n  with concrete 6 ft. thick, a huge tank is formed of an average inside\r\n  clear depth of 20 ft. in which the basements are built. The new \"Old\r\n  Bailey\" buildings in Newgate Street, London, are constructed on a\r\n  concrete table 5 ft. thick, as also are the Army and Navy Auxiliary\r\n  Stores, Victoria Street. At Kennet's Wharf, near Southwark Bridge, a\r\n  concrete table, 8 ft. thick, was spread all over the site, with an\r\n  extra thickness under the walls. Foundations formed similarly to dock\r\n  foundations, but in addition having steel joists and rods inserted in\r\n  the thickness of the concrete table, to tie the whole together, are\r\n  known as _gridiron_ foundations.\r\n\r\n  In the Hennebique concrete system, all beams, &c., are formed with\r\n  small rods and then surrounded with concrete; it is designed for\r\n  floors and for spreading the weight of a building over an extended\r\n  foundation on soft ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cantilever foundations.\r\n\r\n  Where a heavy wall is to be built against an old one and there is not\r\n  sufficient room for the foundations, the plan is adopted of building\r\n  pier foundations at some distance from the proposed new wall. On the\r\n  top of these piers rest steel cantilevers over steel pin rockers upon\r\n  cast iron bedplates; the cantilevers are secured at one end to a\r\n  column, while the other ends go through the full thickness of the new\r\n  wall. Upon these last ends is placed a steel girder upon which the\r\n  wall is built. This construction (fig. 12) has been used in America,\r\n  and in the Ritz Hotel, Piccadilly, London.\r\n\r\n  Another form of cantilever foundations was employed in the case of\r\n  some premises at Carr's Lane, Birmingham, partly built over the Great\r\n  Western railway tunnel (fig. 13). In this instance large piers were\r\n  built below the ground at the side of the tunnel. From the tops of\r\n  these piers large steel cantilevers were erected projecting over the\r\n  crown of the tunnel, and on these steel girders were fixed and the\r\n  building constructed upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Foundations in Tunis.\r\n\r\n  In modern Tunis, a section of which city is built on marshy ground,\r\n  the subsoil is an oozy sediment, largely deposited by the sewage water\r\n  from the ancient or Arab quarter of the city, which is situated on an\r\n  adjacent hill. This semi-fluid mud has a depth of about 33 ft. To\r\n  prepare the soil for supporting an ordinary house, pits from 8 ft. to\r\n  10 ft. square are excavated to a depth of about 10 ft., to the level\r\n  of the ground water. A mixture is made of the excavated soil and\r\n  powdered fat lime, procured from clinkers and unburnt stone from the\r\n  lime-kilns, which soon crumbles to fine dust when exposed to the air.\r\n  The mixture is thrown into pits in layers about 12 in. thick and\r\n  rammed down for a very long time by specially trained labourers. A\r\n  gang of 15 or 20 men will work at least 10 or 12 days ramming for the\r\n  foundations of a moderate-sized house. An extremely hard bed is thus\r\n  obtained, reaching to within 18 in. of the surface of the ground, and\r\n  on this artificial bed the foundations of the building are laid.\r\n  Although this method of construction is crude, it is stated that the\r\n  practical results are superior to those obtained by using piles,\r\n  concrete or other recognized methods, and in all cases the cost is\r\n  much less, for labour is cheap.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Building on sand.\r\n\r\n  A novel and interesting foundation was designed for a signal station\r\n  at Cape Henlopen, Delaware. This is built on top of the highest\r\n  sandhill at Cape Henlopen, so that the observer may have an\r\n  unobstructed view; it rises about 80 ft. above the level of the sea\r\n  and is exposed to all winds and weather, while it is absolutely\r\n  required that it shall stand firmly planted in such a way that even a\r\n  hurricane shall not shake it or make it tremble, since that would\r\n  affect the sight of the telescope in the observatory. The usual mode\r\n  of securing such a building is by means of a foundation of screw piles\r\n  or of heavy timbers sunk into the sand; this method, however, has the\r\n  disadvantage that if the wind shifts the sand away from around the\r\n  foundation, it becomes undermined and its effect is destroyed. To\r\n  avoid such an accident, recourse was had to the following design,\r\n  which was considered to be cheap and at the same time to provide an\r\n  effective anchorage. The building is entirely of wood; it has a\r\n  cellar, above which are two rooms one above the other, and the whole\r\n  is surmounted by the observatory proper. First, the ground sill is a\r\n  square of 20 ft., made of yellow pine sticks mortised together and\r\n  pinned with stout trunnels. The sill of the observatory is made\r\n  likewise of heavy timbers, 12 ft. long. The two sills are joined\r\n  together by four stout yellow pine corner posts, which in turn are\r\n  mortised into both sills. The posts are 26 ft. in length. Five feet\r\n  above the lower sill is the sill which supports the floor of the first\r\n  room. Ten feet above this is the sill which supports the upper room.\r\n  Both these sills again are mortised into the corner posts. The\r\n  structure is sheathed outside with German siding, and inside with\r\n  rough boards covered with felt, and again by tongued and grooved\r\n  yellow pine boards. The observatory proper, octagonal in shape, is\r\n  securely mortised into the top sill and covered with a corrugated iron\r\n  roof conical in shape. The cellar is floored with 3 in. wood, and\r\n  boarded all round on the inside of the posts. A pit was first dug in\r\n  the sand about 6 ft. deep and fully 20 ft. wide on the bottom. The\r\n  cellar sill was laid on this bottom, and the structure built upon it;\r\n  thus the whole depth of cellar is sunk below the top of the hill or\r\n  the level of the sand. The cellar was then filled up with sand and\r\n  packed solid all round, consequently the building is anchored in its\r\n  place by the load in the cellar, about 100 tons in weight.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Cantilever Foundation over Railway Tunnel.]\r\n\r\n  The subject of foundations, being naturally of the first importance,\r\n  is one that calls for most careful study. It is not of so much\r\n  importance that the ground be hard or even rocky as that it be compact\r\n  and of similar consistency throughout. It is not always that a site\r\n  answers to this description, and the problem of what will be the best\r\n  form of foundation to use in placing a building, more especially if\r\n  that building be of large dimensions and consequently great weight, on\r\n  a site of soft yielding soil, is one that is often most difficult of\r\n  solution. The foregoing article indicates in a brief manner some of\r\n  the obstacles the architect or engineer is required to surmount before\r\n  his work can even be started on its way to completion.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The principal books for reference on this subject are:\r\n  _A Practical Treatise on Foundations_, by W.M. Patron, C. E.;\r\n  _Building Construction and Superintendence_, part i., by F.E. Kidder;\r\n  _Notes on Building Construction_, vols. i. ii. and iii.; _Aide\r\n  Memoir_, vol. ii., by Colonel Seddon, R.E.; _Advanced Building\r\n  Construction_, by C.F. Mitchell; _Modern House Construction_, by G.L.\r\n  Sutcliffe; _Building Construction_, by Professor Henry Adams;\r\n  _Practical Building Construction_, by J.P. Allen.     (J. Bt.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDING (from Lat. _fundere_, to pour), the process of casting in\r\nmetal, of making a reproduction of a given object by running molten\r\nmetal into a mould taken in sand, loam or plaster from that object. To\r\nenable the founder to prepare a mould for the casting, he must receive a\r\npattern similar to the casting required. Some few exceptions occur, to\r\nbe noted presently, but the above statement is true of perhaps 98% of\r\nall castings produced. The construction of such patterns gives\r\nemployment to a large number of highly skilled men, who can only acquire\r\nthe necessary knowledge through an apprenticeship lasting from five to\r\nseven years. A knowledge of two trades at least is involved in the work\r\nof pattern construction--that of the craft itself and that of the\r\nmoulder and founder. Patterns have to be constructed strongly. They are\r\ngenerally of wood, and they thus require skill in the use of woodworking\r\ntools and the making of timber joints, together with a knowledge of the\r\nbehaviour of timber, &c. Some few patterns are made in iron, brass or\r\nwhite metal alloys. They have to be embedded in a matrix of sand by the\r\nfounder, and being enclosed, they have to be withdrawn without\r\ninflicting any damage in the way of fracture in the sand. Since cast\r\nwork involves shapes that are often very intricate, including\r\nprojections and hollow spaces of all forms, it is obvious that the\r\nwithdrawal of the patterns without entailing tearing up and fracture of\r\nthe sand must involve many difficult problems that have to be as fully\r\nunderstood by the pattern-maker as by the moulder. It is from this point\r\nof view that the work of the pattern-maker should be approached in the\r\nfirst place. No closed mould can possibly be made without one or more\r\njoints, for if a pattern is wholly enclosed in a matrix of sand it\r\ncannot be withdrawn except by making a parting in the sand, and it is\r\nnot difficult to conceive that the parting in the pattern might\r\nadvantageously be made to coincide, either exactly or approximately,\r\nwith that of the mould. Nor must obstacles exist to the free withdrawal\r\nof patterns. They must therefore not be wider or larger in the lower\r\nthan in the upper parts; actually they are made a trifle smaller or\r\n\"tapered.\" Nor may they have any lateral extensions into the lower sand,\r\nunless these can be made to withdraw separately from the main portion of\r\nthe pattern. Finally, there are many internal spaces which cannot be\r\nformed by a pattern directly in the sand, but provision for which must\r\nbe made by some means extraneous to the pattern, as by cores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n  A single example must illustrate the main principles which have just\r\n  been stated. The object selected is a bracket which involves questions\r\n  of joints, of cores, of pattern construction and of moulding. The\r\n  casting, the pattern, and its mould are illustrated. Fig. 1\r\n  illustrates in plan the casting of a double bracket, the end elevation\r\n  of which is seen in fig. 2; the pattern of which presents obvious\r\n  difficulties in the way of withdrawal from a mould, supposing it were\r\n  made just like its casting. But if it be made as in fig. 3, with the\r\n  open spaces A, B, in fig. 2, occupied with core prints, and the pieces\r\n  A, A in fig. 3 left loosely skewered on, everything will \"deliver\"\r\n  freely. Moreover the pattern might be made solidly as shown in fig. 3,\r\n  or else jointed and dowelled in the plane a-a, as in fig. 4, or along\r\n  the upper faces of the prints b-b, fig. 3. The timber shadings in\r\n  figs. 3 and 4 illustrate points in the most suitable arrangement of\r\n  material. The prints are \"boxed up.\" Fig. 4 shows a certain stage of\r\n  the moulding, in which one half of the pattern has been \"rammed\" in\r\n  sand, and turned over in the \"bottom box,\" and the upper half is ready\r\n  to be rammed in the \"top box,\" with \"runner pin\" or \"git stick\" A, set\r\n  in place. The lower loose piece has had its skewer removed during the\r\n  ramming. Fig. 5 illustrates the mould completed and ready for pouring.\r\n  The boxes have been parted, the pattern has been withdrawn, cores\r\n  inserted in the impressions left by the prints, vents taken from the\r\n  central body of cinders, the pouring basin made and the boxes cottered\r\n  together.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n  Every single detail now briefly noted in connexion with this bracket\r\n  is applied and modified in an almost infinite number of ways to suit\r\n  the ever varying character of foundry work. Yet this process does not\r\n  touch some of the great subdivisions of moulding and casting. There is\r\n  a large volume of large and heavy work for which complete patterns and\r\n  core boxes are never made, because of the great expense that would be\r\n  involved in the pattern construction. There are also some cases in\r\n  which the methods adopted would not permit of the use of patterns, as\r\n  in that group of work in which the sand or loam is \"swept\" to the form\r\n  required for the moulds and cores by means of striking boards, loam\r\n  boards, core boards or strickles. In these classes of moulding the\r\n  loose green sands and core sands are not much used; instead, loam--a\r\n  wet and plastic sand mixture--is employed, supported against bricks\r\n  (loam moulds) or against core bars and plates, and hay ropes (loam\r\n  cores). All heavy marine engine cylinders are thus made by sweeping,\r\n  and all massive cores for engine cylinders and large pipes, besides\r\n  much large circular and cylindrical work, as foundation cylinders,\r\n  soap pans, lead pans, mortar pans, large propeller blades, &c. In\r\n  these cases the edge of the striking board is a counterpart of the\r\n  profile of the work swept up. Joints also have to be made in such\r\n  moulds, not of course in order to provide for the removal of a\r\n  pattern, but for the exposure of the separate parts in course of\r\n  construction, and for closing them up, or putting them together in\r\n  their due relations. These joints also are swept by the boards,\r\n  generally cut to produce suitable \"checks,\" or \"registers\" to ensure\r\n  that they accurately fit together. Fig. 6, showing a portion of a\r\n  swept-up mould, illustrates the general arrangement. A plate, A,\r\n  carries a quantity of bricks, B, which are embedded in loam, and break\r\n  joint. To a striking bar, C, supported in a step, a striking board or\r\n  sweeping board, D, is bolted, and is swept round against plastic loam,\r\n  which is afterwards dried. The check on the board at A corresponds\r\n  with a similar check on the board which strikes the interior of the\r\n  pan, and by which top and bottom portions of the mould are registered\r\n  together. This is indicated in dotted outline. Its mould also is swept\r\n  on bricks, and turned over into place, and the metal is poured into\r\n  the space b, b, between the two moulds. There is also a large group of\r\n  swept-up work which is not symmetrical about a centre of rotation.\r\n  Then the movements of the sweeping boards are controlled by the edges\r\n  of \"core plates,\" or of \"core irons\" (fig. 7). Bend pipes, and the\r\n  volute casings of centrifugal pumps and pipes, afford examples of this\r\n  kind. In fig. 7, A is the core iron, held down by weights, and B the\r\n  \"strickle,\" sweeping up the half bend C, two such halves pasted\r\n  together completing the core.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n  Core-making is a special department of foundry work, often involving\r\n  as much detail as the construction and moulding of patterns. Two\r\n  perfectly plain boxes are shown in figs. 8 and 9, in both of which\r\n  provision exists for removing the box parts from the core after the\r\n  latter has been rammed. Core boxes are jointed and tapered, and often\r\n  have loose pieces within them, and also prints, into the impressions\r\n  of which other cores are inserted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n_Machine-moulding._--There is a development of modern methods of\r\nfounding which is effecting radical changes in some departments of\r\nfoundry practice, namely, moulding by machines. The advantages of this\r\nmethod are manifold, and its limitations are being lessened\r\ncontinually. There are two broad departments between which\r\nmachine-moulding is divided. One, of less importance, is that of toothed\r\nwheels; the other is that of general work, except of a very massive\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nGear-wheel moulding machines are essentially a special adaptation of the\r\nmechanism of the dividing engine, by means of which, instead of using a\r\ncomplete pattern of a toothed wheel, two or three pattern teeth are\r\nused, and the machine takes charge of the correct pitching or division\r\nof the teeth moulded therefrom, leaving to the moulder the work only of\r\nturning the handle of the division plate, and ramming the sand around\r\nthe pattern teeth. The result is accurate pitching, and the use of two\r\nor three teeth instead of a full pattern, together with any core boxes\r\nand striking boards that are necessary for the arms.\r\n\r\nThe other department of machine moulding includes nearly every\r\nconceivable class of work of small and medium dimensions. There are some\r\ndozens of distinct types of machines in use, for no one type is suitable\r\nfor all classes of moulds, while some are designed specially for one or\r\ntwo kinds only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n  The fundamental principles of operation are briefly these: The pattern\r\n  parts constitute, by their method of attachment to a plate or table A\r\n  (fig. 10), an integral portion of the machine, so that they must\r\n  partake of certain movements which are imparted to it. Often patterns\r\n  mounted, as in fig. 10, are moulded by hand, without any aid from a\r\n  machine, by methods of \"plate-moulding.\" The delivery of the pattern\r\n  from the sand is invariably accomplished by a perpendicular movement\r\n  of a portion of the machine (fig. 11), withdrawing either the pattern\r\n  from the mould or the mould from the pattern. The important point is\r\n  that the perpendicular movement, being under the coercion of the\r\n  vertical guides provided in the hand machines, or the hydraulic ram in\r\n  fig. 11, is free from the unsteadiness which is incidental to\r\n  withdrawal by the hands of the moulder; and if the machine performed\r\n  nothing more than this it would justify its existence. Little or no\r\n  taper is required in the pattern, and the moulds are more nearly\r\n  uniform in dimensions than hand-made moulds. But there are other\r\n  advantages. In machine-moulding the joint faces for parting moulds\r\n  are produced by the faces of the plates on which the pattern is\r\n  mounted (figs. 10 and 11), instead of by the hands and trowel of the\r\n  moulder. When the joint face is of irregular outline, as it often is,\r\n  this item alone saves a good deal of time, which again is multiplied\r\n  by the number of moulds repeated, often amounting to thousands.\r\n  Further, provision is generally made on machine plates for the ingates\r\n  and runners (fig. 10) through which the metal enters the mould, the\r\n  preparation of which in hand work occupies a considerable amount of\r\n  time. Another great advantage applies especially to the case of deep\r\n  moulds. These give much trouble in hand-moulding in consequence of the\r\n  liability of the sand to become torn up during the withdrawal of the\r\n  pattern. But in machine-moulding such patterns are encircled by a\r\n  plate, termed a \"stripping plate,\" which is pierced to allow the\r\n  patterns to pass through, and which, being maintained firmly on the\r\n  sand during the lifting of the pattern, prevents it from becoming torn\r\n  up. This is not merely a matter of convenience, but is a necessity in\r\n  numerous instances. The most familiar example is that of the teeth of\r\n  gear wheels, in which even a very slight amount of taper interferes\r\n  with accurate engagement, and this is representative of many other\r\n  portions of mechanism. These stripping plates are of metal, but in\r\n  order to save the cost of filing them in iron or steel, many are\r\n  cheaply made by casting a white metal alloy round the actual pattern\r\n  itself in the first place, the white metal being enclosed and retained\r\n  in a plain iron frame which forms the body of the plate. Lastly, many\r\n  machines, but not the majority, include provision for mechanically\r\n  ramming the sand around the pattern by power instead of by hand. This\r\n  is really the least valuable feature of a moulding machine, because it\r\n  is not applicable to any but rather shallow moulds. It is commonly\r\n  used for these, but the consistence and homogeneity of a mass of sand\r\n  round a pattern having deep perpendicular sides can only be ensured by\r\n  careful hand ramming.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n  The highest economies of machine-moulding are obtained when (1)\r\n  several small patterns are mounted and moulded at once on a single\r\n  plate (fig. 10); (2) when top and bottom parts of a mould are produced\r\n  on different machines, carrying each its moiety of the pattern; (3)\r\n  when the machine and pattern details are simplified so much that the\r\n  labour of trained moulders is displaced by that of unskilled\r\n  attendants who are taught in a month or two the few simple operations\r\n  required. That is the direction in which repetitive casting is now\r\n  rapidly tending.\r\n\r\n  In fig. 11 A is the plate, which in its essentials corresponds with\r\n  the plate A in fig. 10, but which in the machine is made to swivel so\r\n  as to bring each half of the pattern B, B in turn uppermost for\r\n  ramming in the box parts C, C. The ramming is done by hand, the final\r\n  squeeze being imparted against the presser D by the action of the\r\n  hydraulic ram E pushing the plate, mould and box up against D. The\r\n  plate being then lowered, and turned over, the further descent of the\r\n  ram withdraws the bottom box from the pattern, which is the stage seen\r\n  in the illustration. Then the half mould is run away on the carriage\r\n  F, provided with wheels to run on rails.\r\n\r\n  Though casting in iron, steel, the bronzes, aluminium, &c., is\r\n  carried on by different men in distinct shops, yet the foregoing\r\n  principles and methods apply to all alike. Work is done in green, i.e.\r\n  moist sand, in dry sand (the moulds being dried before being used),\r\n  and in plastic loam (which is subsequently dried). Hand and machine\r\n  moulding are practised in each, the last-named excepted. The\r\n  differences in working are those due to the various characteristics of\r\n  the different metals and alloys, which involve differences in the sand\r\n  mixtures used, in the dimensions of the pouring channels, of the\r\n  temperature at which the metal or alloy must be poured, of the fluxing\r\n  and cleansing of the metal, and other details of a practical\r\n  character. Hence the practice which is suitable for one department\r\n  must be modified in others. Many castings in steel would inevitably\r\n  fracture if poured into moulds prepared for iron, many iron castings\r\n  would fracture if poured into moulds suitable for brass, and neither\r\n  brass nor steel would fill a mould having ingates proportioned\r\n  suitably for iron.\r\n\r\n  A special kind of casting is that into \"chill moulds,\" adopted in a\r\n  considerable number of iron castings, such as the railway wheels in\r\n  the United States, ordinary tramway wheels, the rolls of iron and\r\n  steel rolling mills, the bores of cast wheel hubs, &c. The chill\r\n  ranges in depth from 1/4 in. to 1 in., and is produced by pouring a\r\n  special mixture of mottled, or strong, iron against a cold iron\r\n  surface, the parts of the casting which are not required to be chilled\r\n  being surrounded by an ordinary mould of sand. The purpose of\r\n  chill-casting is to produce a surface hardness in the metal.\r\n\r\n  The shrinkage of metal is a fact which has to be taken account of by\r\n  the pattern-maker and moulder. A pattern and mould are made larger\r\n  than the size of the casting required by the exact amount that the\r\n  metal will shrink in cooling from the molten to the cold state. This\r\n  amount varies from 1/8 in. in 15 in., in thin iron castings, to 1/8\r\n  in. in 12 in. in heavy ones. It ranges from 3/16 in. to 5/16 in. per\r\n  foot in steel, brass and aluminium. Its variable amount has to be\r\n  borne in mind in making light and heavy-castings, and castings with or\r\n  without cores, for massive cores retard shrinkage. It is also a\r\n  fruitful cause of fracture in badly proportioned castings,\r\n  particularly of those in steel. Brass is less liable to suffer in this\r\n  respect than iron, and iron much less than steel.     (J. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDLING HOSPITALS, originally institutions for the reception of\r\n\"foundlings,\" i.e. children who have been abandoned or exposed, and left\r\nfor the public to find and save. The early history of such institutions\r\nis connected with the practice of infanticide, and in western Europe\r\nwhere social disorder was rife and famine of frequent occurrence,\r\nexposure and extensive sales of children were the necessary\r\nconsequences. Against these evils, which were noticed by several\r\ncouncils, the church provided a rough system of relief, children being\r\ndeposited (_jactati_) in marble shells at the church doors, and tended\r\nfirst by the _matricularii_ or male nurses, and then by the _nutricarii_\r\nor foster-parents.[1] But it was in the 7th and 8th centuries that\r\ndefinite institutions for foundlings were established in such towns as\r\nTreves, Milan and Montpellier. In the 15th century Garcias, archbishop\r\nof Valencia, was a conspicuous figure in this charitable work; but his\r\nfame is entirely eclipsed by that of St Vincent de Paul, who in the\r\nreign of Louis XIII., with the help of the countess of Joigny, Mme le\r\nGras and other religious ladies, rescued the foundlings of Paris from\r\nthe horrors of a primitive institution named La Couche (rue St Landry),\r\nand ultimately obtained from Louis XIV. the use of the Bicetre for their\r\naccommodation. Letters patent were granted to the Paris hospital in\r\n1670. The Hotel-Dieu of Lyons was the next in importance. No provision,\r\nhowever, was made outside the great towns; the houses in the cities were\r\novercrowded and administered with laxity; and in 1784 Necker prophesied\r\nthat the state would yet be seriously embarrassed by this increasing\r\nevil.[2] From 1452 to 1789 the law had imposed on the _seigneurs de\r\nhaute justice_ the duty of succouring children found deserted on their\r\nterritories. The first constitutions of the Revolution undertook as a\r\nstate debt the support of every foundling. For a time premiums were\r\ngiven to the mothers of illegitimate children, the \"enfants de la\r\npatrie.\" By the law of 12 Brumaire, An II. \"Toute recherche de la\r\npaternite est interdite,\" while by art. 341 of the Code Napoleon, \"la\r\nrecherche de la maternite est admise.\"\r\n\r\n  _France._--The laws of France relating to this part of what is called\r\n  L'Assistance Publique are the decree of January 1811, the instruction\r\n  of February 1823, the decree of the 5th of March 1852, the law of the\r\n  5th of May 1869, the law of the 24th of July 1889 and the law of the\r\n  27th of June 1904. These laws carry out the general principles of the\r\n  law of 7 Frimaire An V., which completely decentralized the system of\r\n  national poor relief established by the Revolution. The _enfants\r\n  assistes_ include, besides (1) orphans and (2) foundlings proper, (3)\r\n  children abandoned by their parents, (4) ill-treated, neglected or\r\n  morally abandoned children whose parents have been deprived of their\r\n  parental rights by the decision of a court of justice, (5) children,\r\n  under sixteen years of age, of parents condemned for certain crimes,\r\n  whose parental rights have been delegated by a tribunal to the state.\r\n  Children classified under 1-5 are termed _pupilles de l'assistance_,\r\n  \"wards of public charity,\" and are distinguished by the law of 1904\r\n  from children under the protection of the state, classified as: (1)\r\n  _enfants secourus_, i.e. children whose parents or relatives are\r\n  unable, through poverty, to support them; (2) _enfants en depot_, i.e.\r\n  children of persons undergoing a judicial sentence and children\r\n  temporarily taken in while their parents are in hospital, and (3)\r\n  _enfants en garde_, i.e. children who have either committed or been\r\n  the victim of some felony or crime and are placed under state care by\r\n  judicial authority. The asylum which receives all these children is a\r\n  departmental (_etablissement depositaire_), and not a communal\r\n  institution. The etablissement depositaire is usually the ward of an\r\n  hospice, in which--with the exception of children _en depot_--the stay\r\n  is of the shortest, for by the law of 1904, continuing the principle\r\n  laid down in 1811, all children under thirteen years of age under the\r\n  guardianship of the state, except the mentally or physically infirm,\r\n  must be boarded out in country districts. They are generally\r\n  apprenticed to some one engaged in the agricultural industry, and\r\n  until majority they remain under the guardianship of the\r\n  administrative commissioners of the department. The state pays the\r\n  whole of the cost of inspection and supervision. The expenses of\r\n  administration, the \"home\" expenses, for the nurse (_nourrice\r\n  sedentaire_) or the wet nurse (_nourrice au sein_), the _prime de\r\n  survie_ (premium on survival), washing, clothes, and the \"outdoor\"\r\n  expenses, which include (1) temporary assistance to unmarried mothers\r\n  in order to prevent desertion; (2) allowances to the foster-parents\r\n  (_nourriciers_) in the country for board, school-money, &c.; (3)\r\n  clothing; (4) travelling-money for nurses and children; (5) printing,\r\n  &c.; (6) expenses in time of sickness and for burials and apprentice\r\n  fees--are borne in the proportion of two-fifths by the state\r\n  two-fifths by the department, and the remaining fifth by the communes.\r\n  The following figures show the number of children (exclusive of\r\n  _enfants secourus_) relieved at various periods:\r\n\r\n    Year.       Number relieved.\r\n    1890             95,701\r\n    1895            121,201\r\n    1900            138,308\r\n    1905            149,803\r\n\r\n  The _droit de recherche_ is conceded to the parent on payment of a\r\n  small fee. The decree of 1811 contemplated the repayment of all\r\n  expenses by a parent reclaiming a child. The same decree directed a\r\n  _tour_ or revolving box (_Drehcylinder_ in Germany) to be kept at each\r\n  hospital. These have been discontinued. The \"Assistance Publique\" of\r\n  Paris is managed by a \"directeur\" appointed by the minister of the\r\n  interior, and associated with a representative _conseil de\r\n  surveillance_. The Paris Hospice des Enfants-Assistes contains about\r\n  700 beds. There are also in Paris numerous private charities for the\r\n  adoption of poor children and orphans. It is impossible here to give\r\n  even a sketch of the long and able controversies which have occurred\r\n  in France on the principles of management of foundling hospitals, the\r\n  advantages of _tours_ and the system of admission _a bureau ouvert_,\r\n  the transfer of orphans from one department to another, the hygiene\r\n  and service of hospitals and the inspection of nurses, the education\r\n  and reclamation of the children and the rights of the state in their\r\n  future. Reference may be made to the works noticed at the end of this\r\n  article.\r\n\r\n  _Belgium._--In this country the arrangements for the relief of\r\n  foundlings and the appropriation of public funds for that purpose very\r\n  much resemble those in France, and can hardly be usefully described\r\n  apart from the general questions of local government and poor law\r\n  administration. The Commissions des Hospices Civiles, however, are\r\n  purely communal bodies, although they receive pecuniary assistance\r\n  from both the departments and the state. A decree of 1811 directed\r\n  that there should be an asylum and a wheel for receiving foundlings in\r\n  every arrondissement. The last \"wheel,\" that of Antwerp, was closed in\r\n  1860. (See _Des Institutions de bienfaisance et de prevoyance en\r\n  Belgique_, 1850 a 1860, par M.P. Lentz.)\r\n\r\n  _Italy_ is very rich in foundling hospitals, pure and simple, orphans\r\n  and other destitute children being separately provided for. (See\r\n  _Della carita preventiva in Italia_, by Signor Fano.) In Rome one\r\n  branch of the Santo Spirito in Sassia (so called from the Schola\r\n  Saxonum built in 728 by King Ina in the Borgo) has, since the time of\r\n  Pope Sixtus IV., been devoted to foundlings. The average annual number\r\n  of foundlings supported is about 3000. (See _The Charitable\r\n  Institutions of Rome_, by Cardinal Morichini.) In Venice the Casa\r\n  degli Esposti or foundling hospital, founded in 1346, and receiving\r\n  450 children annually, is under provincial administration. The\r\n  splendid legacy of the last doge, Ludovico Manin, is applied to the\r\n  support of about 160 children by the \"Congregazione di Carita\" acting\r\n  through 30 parish boards (_deputazione fraternate_).\r\n\r\n  _Austria._--In Austria foundling hospitals occupied a very prominent\r\n  place in the general instructions which, by rescript dated 16th of\r\n  April 1781, the emperor Joseph II. issued to the charitable endowment\r\n  commission. In 1818 foundling asylums and lying-in houses were\r\n  declared to be state institutions. They were accordingly supported by\r\n  the state treasury until the fundamental law of 20th October 1860\r\n  handed them over to the provincial committees. They are now local\r\n  institutions, depending on provincial funds, and are quite separate\r\n  from the ordinary parochial poor institute. Admission is gratuitous\r\n  when the child is actually found on the street, or is sent by a\r\n  criminal court, or where the mother undertakes to serve for four\r\n  months as nurse or midwife in an asylum, or produces a certificate\r\n  from the parish priest and \"poor-father\" (the parish inspector of the\r\n  poor-law administration) that she has no money. In other cases\r\n  payments of 30 to 100 florins are made. When two months old the child\r\n  is sent for six or ten years to the houses in the neighbourhood of\r\n  respectable married persons, who have certificates from the police or\r\n  the poor-law authorities, and who are inspected by the latter and by a\r\n  special medical officer. These persons receive a constantly\r\n  diminishing allowance, and the arrangement may be determined by 14\r\n  days' notice on either side. The foster-parents may retain the child\r\n  in their service or employment till the age of twenty-two, but the\r\n  true parents may at any time reclaim the foundling on reimbursing the\r\n  asylum and compensating the foster-parents.\r\n\r\n  _Russia._--Under the old Russian system of Peter I. foundlings were\r\n  received at the church windows by a staff of women paid by the state.\r\n  But since the reign of Catherine II. the foundling hospitals have been\r\n  in the hands of the provincial officer of public charity (prykaz\r\n  obshestvennago pryzrenya). The great central institutions\r\n  (Vospitatelnoi Dom), at Moscow and St Petersburg (with a branch at\r\n  Gatchina), were founded by Catherine. When a child is brought the\r\n  baptismal name is asked, and a receipt is given, by which the child\r\n  may be reclaimed up to the age of ten. The mother may nurse her child.\r\n  After the usual period of six years in the country very great care is\r\n  taken with the education, especially of the more promising children.\r\n  The hospital is a valuable source of recruits for the public service.\r\n  Malthus (_The Principles of Population_, vol. i. p. 434) has made a\r\n  violent attack on these Russian charities. He argues that they\r\n  discourage marriage and therefore population, and that the best\r\n  management is unable to prevent a high mortality. He adds: \"An\r\n  occasional child murder from false shame is saved at a very high price\r\n  if it can be done only by the sacrifice of some of the best and most\r\n  useful feelings of the human heart in a great part of the nation.\" It\r\n  does not appear, however, that the rate of illegitimacy in Russia is\r\n  comparatively high; it is so in the two great cities. The rights of\r\n  parents over the children were very much restricted, and those of the\r\n  government much extended by a ukase issued by the emperor Nicholas in\r\n  1837. The most eminent Russian writer on this subject is M. Gourov.\r\n  See his _Recherches sur les enfants trouves_, and _Essai sur\r\n  l'histoire des enfants trouves_ (Paris, 1829).\r\n\r\n  In _America_, foundling hospitals, which are chiefly private\r\n  charities, exist in most of the large cities.\r\n\r\n  _Great Britain._--The Foundling Hospital of London was incorporated by\r\n  royal charter in 1739 \"for the maintenance and education of exposed\r\n  and deserted young children.\" The petition of Captain Thomas Coram,\r\n  who is entitled to the whole credit of the foundation,[3] states as\r\n  its objects \"to prevent the frequent murders of poor miserable\r\n  children at their birth, and to suppress the inhuman custom of\r\n  exposing new-born infants to perish in the streets.\" At first no\r\n  questions were asked about child or parent, but a distinguishing mark\r\n  was put on each child by the parent. These were often marked coins,\r\n  trinkets, pieces of cotton or ribbon, verses written on scraps of\r\n  paper. The clothes, if any, were carefully recorded. One entry is,\r\n  \"Paper on the breast, clout on the head.\" The applications became too\r\n  numerous, and a system of balloting with red, white and black balls\r\n  was adopted. In 1756 the House of Commons came to a resolution that\r\n  all children offered should be received, that local receiving places\r\n  should be appointed all over the country, and that the funds should be\r\n  publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the\r\n  hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two to twelve\r\n  months, and a flood of children poured in from the country workhouses.\r\n  In less than four years 14,934 children were presented, and a vile\r\n  trade grew up among vagrants of undertaking to carry children from the\r\n  country to the hospital,--an undertaking which, like the French\r\n  _meneurs_, they often did not perform or performed with great cruelty.\r\n  Of these 15,000 only 4400 lived to be apprenticed out. The total\r\n  expense was about L500,000. This alarmed the House of Commons. After\r\n  throwing out a bill which proposed to raise the necessary funds by\r\n  fees from a general system of parochial registration, they came to the\r\n  conclusion that the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued.\r\n  The hospital, being thus thrown on its own resources, adopted a\r\n  pernicious system of receiving children with considerable sums (e.g.\r\n  L100), which sometimes led to the children being reclaimed by the\r\n  parent. This was finally stopped in 1801; and it is now a fundamental\r\n  rule that no money is received. The committee of inquiry must now be\r\n  satisfied of the previous good character and present necessity of the\r\n  mother, and that the father of the child has deserted it and the\r\n  mother, and that the reception of the child will probably replace the\r\n  mother in the course of virtue and in the way of an honest livelihood.\r\n  All the children at the Foundling hospital are those of unmarried\r\n  women, and they are all first children of their mothers. The principle\r\n  is in fact that laid down by Fielding in _Tom Jones_--\"Too true I am\r\n  afraid it is that many women have become abandoned and have sunk to\r\n  the last degree of vice by being unable to retrieve the first slip.\"\r\n  At present the hospital supports about 500 children up to the age of\r\n  fifteen. The average annual number of applications is over 200, and of\r\n  admissions between 40 and 50. The children used to be named after the\r\n  patrons and governors, but the treasurer now prepares a list. Children\r\n  are seldom taken after they are twelve months old. On reception they\r\n  are sent down to the country, where they stay until they are about\r\n  four or five years old. At sixteen the girls are generally apprenticed\r\n  as servants for four years, and the boys at the age of fourteen as\r\n  mechanics for seven years. There is a small benevolent fund for\r\n  adults. The musical service, which was originally sung by the blind\r\n  children only, was made fashionable by the generosity of Handel, who\r\n  frequently had the \"Messiah\" performed there, and who bequeathed to\r\n  the hospital a MS. copy (full score) of his greatest oratorio. The\r\n  altar-piece is West's picture of Christ presenting a little Child. In\r\n  1774 Dr Burney and Signor Giardini made an unsuccessful attempt to\r\n  form in connexion with the hospital a public music school, in\r\n  imitation of the Conservatorium of the Continent. In 1847, however, a\r\n  successful \"Juvenile Band\" was started. The educational effects of\r\n  music have been found excellent, and the hospital supplies many\r\n  musicians to the best army and navy bands. The early connexion between\r\n  the hospital and the eminent painters of the reign of George II. is\r\n  one of extreme interest. The exhibitions of pictures at the Foundling,\r\n  which were organized by the Dilettanti Club, undoubtedly led to the\r\n  formation of the Royal Academy in 1768. Hogarth painted a portrait of\r\n  Captain Coram for the hospital, which also contains his March to\r\n  Finchley, and Roubillac's bust of Handel. (See _History and Objects of\r\n  the Foundling Hospital, with Memoir of its Founder_, by J. Brownlow.)\r\n\r\n  In 1704 the Foundling hospital of Dublin was opened. No inquiry was\r\n  made about the parents, and no money received. From 1500 to 2000\r\n  children were received annually. A large income was derived from a\r\n  duty on coal and the produce of car licences. In 1822 an admission fee\r\n  of L5 was charged on the parish from which the child came. This\r\n  reduced the annual arrivals to about 500. In 1829 the select committee\r\n  on the Irish miscellaneous estimates recommended that no further\r\n  assistance should be given. The hospital had not preserved life or\r\n  educated the foundlings. The mortality was nearly 4 in 5, and the\r\n  total cost L10,000 a year. Accordingly in 1835 Lord Glenelg (then\r\n  Irish Secretary) closed the institution.\r\n\r\n  Scotland never seems to have possessed a foundling hospital. In 1759\r\n  John Watson left funds which were to be applied to the pious and\r\n  charitable purpose \"of preventing child murder\" by the establishment\r\n  of a hospital for receiving pregnant women and taking care of their\r\n  children as foundlings. But by an act of parliament in 1822, which\r\n  sets forth \"doubts as to the propriety\" of the original purpose, the\r\n  money was given to trustees to erect a hospital for the maintenance\r\n  and education of destitute children.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--_Histoire statistique et morale des enfants trouves_ by\r\n  MM.

A very early existing example is preserved in the carved\r\nBabylonian basin (about 3000 B.C.) found at Tello, the ancient Lagash,\r\nand Layard mentions an Assyrian fountain, found by him in a gorge of the\r\nriver Gomel, which consists of a series of basins cut in the solid rock\r\nand descending in steps to the stream. The water had been originally led\r\nfrom one to the other by small conduits, the lowest of which was\r\nornamented by two rampant lions in relief. The term is applied equally\r\nto the simpler arrangements for letting water gush into an ornamental\r\nbasin or to the more elaborate ones by which water is mechanically\r\nforced into high jets; and a \"fountain\" may be either the ornamental\r\nreceptacle or the jet of water itself. In modern times the examples of\r\nornamental or useful fountains are legion, and it will suffice here to\r\nmention some of the more important facts of historical interest.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks fountains were very common in the cities. Springs being\r\nvery plentiful in Greece, little engineering skill was required to\r\nconvey the water from place to place. Receptacles of sufficient size\r\nwere made for it at the springs; and to maintain its purity, structures\r\nwere raised enclosing and covering the receptacle. In Greece they were\r\ndedicated to gods and goddesses, nymphs and heroes, and were frequently\r\nplaced in or near temples. That of Pirene at Corinth (mentioned also by\r\nHerodotus) was formed of white stone, and contained a number of cells\r\nfrom which the pleasant water flowed into an open basin. Legend connects\r\nit with the nymph Pirene, who shed such copious tears, when bewailing\r\nher son who had been slain by Diana, that she was changed into a\r\nfountain. The city of Corinth possessed many fountains. In one near the\r\nstatues of Diana and Bellerophon the water flowed through the hoofs of\r\nthe horse Pegasus. The fountain of Glauce, enclosed in the Odeum, was\r\ndedicated to Glauce, because she was said to have thrown herself into it\r\nbelieving that its waters could counteract the poisons of Medea. Another\r\nCorinthian fountain had a bronze statue of Poseidon standing on a\r\ndolphin from which the water flowed. The fountain constructed by\r\nTheagenes at Megara was remarkable for its size and decorations, and for\r\nthe number of its columns. One at Lerna was surrounded with pillars, and\r\nthe structure contained a number of seats affording a cool summer\r\nretreat. Near Pharae was a grove dedicated to Apollo, and in it a\r\nfountain of water. Pausanias gives a definite architectural detail when\r\nhe says that a fountain at Patrae was reached from without by descending\r\nsteps. Mystical, medicinal, surgical and other qualities, as well as\r\nsupernatural origin, were ascribed to fountains. One at Cyane in Lycia\r\nwas said to possess the quality of endowing all persons descending into\r\nit with power to see whatever they desired to see; while the legends of\r\nfountains and other waters with strange powers to heal are numerous in\r\nmany lands. The fountain Enneacrunus at Athens was called Callirrhoe\r\nbefore the time the water was drawn from it by the nine pipes from which\r\nit took its later name. Two temples were above it, according to\r\nPausanias, one dedicated to Demeter and Persephone, and the other to\r\nTriptolemus. The fountain in the temple of Erechtheus at Athens was\r\nsupplied by a spring of salt water, and a similar spring supplied that\r\nin the temple of Poseidon Hippios at Mantinea.\r\n\r\nThe water-supply of Rome and the works auxiliary to it were on a scale\r\nto be expected from a people of such great practical power. The remains\r\nof the aqueducts which stretched from the city across the Campagna are\r\namongst the most striking monuments of Italy. Vitruvius (book viii.)\r\ngives minute particulars concerning the methods to be employed for the\r\ndiscovery, testing and distribution of water, and describes the\r\nproperties of different waters with great care, proving the importance\r\nwhich was attached to these matters by the Romans. The aqueducts\r\nsupplied the baths and the public fountains, from which last all the\r\npopulace, except such as could afford to pay for a separate pipe to\r\ntheir houses, obtained their water. These fountains were therefore of\r\nlarge size and numerous. They were formed at many of the _castella_ of\r\nthe aqueducts. According to Vitruvius, each _castellum_ should have\r\nthree pipes,--one for public fountains, one for baths and the third for\r\nprivate houses. Considerable revenue was drawn from the possessors of\r\nprivate water-pipes. The Roman fountains were generally decorated with\r\nfigures and heads. Fountains were often also the ornament of Roman\r\nvillas and country houses; in those so situated the water generally\r\nally fell from above into a large marble basin, with at times a second\r\nfall into a still lower receptacle. Two adjacent houses in Pompeii had\r\nvery remarkable fountains. One, says Gell, \"is covered with a sort of\r\nmosaic consisting of vitrified tesserae of different colours, but in\r\nwhich blue predominates. These are sometimes arranged in not inelegant\r\npatterns, and the grand divisions as well as the borders are entirely\r\nformed and ornamented with real sea-shells, neither calcined by the heat\r\nof the eruption nor changed by the lapse of so many centuries\"\r\n(_Pompeiana_, i. 196). Another of large size was similarly decorated\r\nwith marine shells, and is supposed to have borne two sculptured\r\nfigures, one of which, a bronze, is in the museum at Naples. This\r\nfountain projects 5 ft. 7 in. from the wall against which it is placed,\r\nand is 7 ft. wide in front, while the height of the structure up to the\r\neaves of the pediment is 7 ft. 7 in. On a central column in the piscina\r\nwas a statue of Cupid, with a dove, from the mouth of which water\r\nissued. Cicero had, at his villa at Formiae, a fountain which was\r\ndecorated with marine shells.\r\n\r\nFountains were very common in the open spaces and at the crossways in\r\nPompeii. They were supplied by leaden pipes from the reservoirs, and had\r\nlittle ornament except a human or animal head, from the mouth of which\r\nit was arranged that the water should issue. Not only did simple running\r\nfountains exist, but the remains of _jets d'eau_ have been found; and a\r\ndrawing exists representing a vase with a double jet of water, standing\r\non a pedestal placed in what is supposed to have been the impluvium of a\r\nhouse. There was also a _jet d'eau_ at the eastern end of the peristyle\r\nof the Fullonica at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nAs among the Greeks, so with the early Celts, traces of superstitious\r\nbeliefs and usages with relation to fountains can be traced in\r\nmonumental and legendary remains. Near the village of Primaleon in\r\nBrittany was a very remarkable monument,--one possibly unique, as giving\r\ndistinct proof of the existence of an ancient cult of fountains. Here is\r\na dolmen composed of a horizontal table supported by two stones only,\r\none at each end. All the space beneath this altar is occupied by a long\r\nsquare basin formed of large flat stones, which receives a fountain of\r\nwater. At Lochrist is another vestige of the Celtic cult of fountains.\r\nBeneath the church, and at the foot of the hill upon which it is built,\r\nis a sacred fountain, near which is erected an ancient chapel, which\r\nwith its ivy-covered walls has a most romantic appearance. A Gothic\r\nvault protects this fountain. Miraculous virtues are still attributed to\r\nits water, and on certain days the country people still come with\r\nofferings to draw it (see La Poix de Freminville, _Antiquites de la\r\nBretagne_, i. p. 101). In the enchanted forest of Brochelande, so famous\r\nfrom its connexion with Merlin, was the fountain of Baranton, which was\r\nsaid to possess strange characteristics. Whoever drew water from it, and\r\nsprinkled the steps therewith, produced a tremendous storm of thunder\r\nand hail, accompanied with thick darkness.\r\n\r\nChristianity transferred to its own uses the ancient religious feeling\r\nconcerning fountains. Statues of the Virgin or of saints were erected\r\nupon the rude structures that collected the water and preserved its\r\npurity. There is some uniformity in the architectural characteristics of\r\nthese structures during the middle ages. A very common form in rural\r\ndistricts was that in which the fountain was reached by descending steps\r\n(_fontaine grotte_). A large basin received the water, sometimes from a\r\nspout, but often from the spring itself. This basin was covered by a\r\nsort of porch or vault, with at times moulded arches and sculptured\r\nfigures and escutcheons. On the bank of the Clain at Poitiers is a\r\nfountain of this kind, the Fontaine Joubert, which though restored in\r\n1597 was originally a structure of the 14th century. This kind of\r\nfountain is frequently decorated with figures of the Virgin or of\r\nsaints, or with the family arms of its founder; often, too, the water is\r\nthe only ornament of the structure, which bears a simple inscription. A\r\nlarge number of these fountains are to be found in Brittany and indeed\r\nthroughout France, and the great antiquity of some of them is proved by\r\nthe superstitions regarding them which still exist amongst the\r\npeasantry. A form more common in populous districts was that of a large\r\nopen basin, round, square, polygonal, or lobed in form, with a columnar\r\nstructure at the centre, from the lower part of which it was arranged\r\nthat spouts should issue, playing into an open basin, and supplying\r\nvessels brought for the purpose in the cleanest and quickest manner. The\r\ncolumns take very various forms, from that of a simple regular\r\ngeometrical solid, with only grotesque masks at the spouts, to that of\r\nan elaborate and ornate Gothic structure, with figures of virgins,\r\nsaints and warriors, with mouldings, arches, crockets and finials. At\r\nProvins there is a fountain said to be of the 12th century, which is in\r\nform an hexagonal vase with a large column in the centre, the capital of\r\nwhich is pierced by three mouths, which are furnished with heads of\r\nbronze projecting far enough to cast the water into the basin. In the\r\npublic market-place at Brunswick is a fountain of the 15th century, of\r\nwhich the central structure is made of bronze. Many fountains are still\r\nexisting in France and Germany which, though their actual present\r\nstructure may date no earlier than the 15th or 16th century, have been\r\nfound on the place of, and perhaps may almost be considered as\r\nrestorations of, pre-existing fountains. Except in Italy few fountains\r\nare of earlier date than the 14th century. Two of that date are at the\r\nabbey of Fontaine Daniel, near Mayenne, and another, of granite, is at\r\nLimoges. Some of these middle-age fountains are simple, open reservoirs\r\nenclosed in structures which, however plain, still carry the charm that\r\nbelongs to the stone-work of those times. There is one of this kind at\r\nCully, Calvados, walled on three sides, and fed from the spring by two\r\ncircular openings. Its only ornamentation is a small empty niche with\r\nmouldings. At Lincoln is a fountain of the time of Henry VIII., in front\r\nof the church of St Mary Wickford. At Durham is one of octangular plan,\r\nwhich bears a statue of Neptune.\r\n\r\nThe decay of architectural taste in the later centuries is shown by the\r\nfountain of Limoges. It is in form a rock representing Mount Parnassus,\r\nupon which are carved in relief Apollo, the horse Pegasus, Philosophy\r\nand the Nine Muses. At the top Apollo, in the 16th-century costume,\r\nplays a harp. Rocks, grass and sheep fill up the scene.\r\n\r\nPurely ornamental fountains and _jets d'eau_ are found in or near many\r\nlarge cities, royal palaces and private seats. The celebrated Fontana di\r\nTrevi, at Rome, was erected early in the 18th century under Pope Clement\r\nXII., and has all the characteristics of decadence. La Fontana Paolina\r\nand those in the piazza of St Peter's are perhaps next in celebrity to\r\nthat of Trevi, and are certainly in better taste. At Paris the Fontaine\r\ndes Innocens (the earliest) and those of the Place Royal, of the Champs\r\nElysees and of the Place de la Concorde are the most noticeable. The\r\nfountain of the lions and other fountains in the Alhambra palace are,\r\nwith their surroundings, a very magnificent sight. The largest _jets\r\nd'eau_ are those at Versailles, at the Sydenham Crystal Palace and at\r\nSan Ildefonso.\r\n\r\nAbout the earliest drawing of any drinking fountain in England occurs in\r\nMoxon's _Tutor to Astronomie and Geographie_ (1659); it is \"surmounted\r\nby a diall, which was made by Mr John Leak, and set upon a composite\r\ncolumn at Leadenhall corner, in the majoralty of Sir John Dethick,\r\nKnight.\" The water springs from the top and base of the column, which\r\nstands upon a square pedestal and bears four female figures, one at\r\nleast of which represents the costume of the period.\r\n\r\nIn the East the public drinking fountains are a very important\r\ninstitution. In Cairo alone there are three hundred. These \"sebeels\" are\r\nnot only to be seen in the cities, but are plentiful in the fields and\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association (1859) has done much to\r\nprovide facilities in London for both man and beast to get water to\r\ndrink in the streets. And in the United States liberal provision has\r\nalso been made by private and public enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNTAINS ABBEY, one of the most celebrated ecclesiastical ruins in\r\nEngland. It lies in the sequestered valley of the river Skell, 3 m. S.W.\r\nof the city of Ripon in Yorkshire. The situation is most beautiful. The\r\nlittle Skell descends from the uplands of Pateley Moor to the west a\r\nclear swift stream, traversing a valley clothed with woods, conspicuous\r\namong which are some ancient yew trees which may have sheltered the\r\nmonks who first sought retreat here. Steep rocky hills enclose the vale.\r\nMainly on the north side of the stream, in an open glade, rise the\r\npicturesque and extensive ruins, the church with its stately tower, and\r\nthe numerous remnants of domestic buildings which enable the great abbey\r\nto be almost completely reconstructed in the mind. The arrangements are\r\ntypical of a Cistercian house (see ABBEY). Building began in earnest\r\nabout 1135, and was continued steadily until the middle of the 13th\r\ncentury, after which the only important erection was Abbot Huby's tower\r\n(c. 1500). The demesne of Studley Royal (marquess of Ripon) contains the\r\nruins. It is in part laid out in the formal Dutch style, the work of\r\nJohn Aislabie, lord of the manor in the early part of the 18th century.\r\nNear the abbey is the picturesque Jacobean mansion of Fountains Hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1132 the prior and twelve monks of St Mary's abbey, York, being\r\ndissatisfied with the easy life they were living, left the monastery and\r\nwith the assistance of Thurstan, archbishop of York, founded a house in\r\nthe valley of the Skell, where they adopted the Cistercian rule. While\r\nbuilding their monastery the monks are said to have lived at first under\r\nan elm and then under seven yew trees called the Seven Sisters. Two\r\nyears later they were joined by Hugh, dean of St Peter's, York, who\r\nbrought with him a large sum of money and a valuable collection of\r\nbooks. His example was followed by Serlo, a monk of St Mary's abbey,\r\nYork, and by Tosti, a canon of York, and others. Henry I. and succeeding\r\nsovereigns granted them many privileges. During the reign of Edward I.\r\nthe monks appear to have again suffered from poverty, partly no doubt\r\nowing to the invasion of the Scots, but partly also through their own\r\n\"misconduct and extravagance.\" On account of this Edward I. in 1291\r\nappointed John de Berwick custodian of the abbey so that he might pay\r\ntheir debts from the issues of their estates, allowing them enough for\r\ntheir maintenance, and Edward II. in 1319 granted them exemption from\r\ntaxes. After the Dissolution Henry VIII. sold the manor and site of the\r\nmonastery to Sir Richard Gresham, and from him after passing through\r\nseveral families it came to the marquess of Ripon.\r\n\r\n  See _Victoria County History, Yorkshire_; Dugdale, _Monasticon_;\r\n  Surtees Society, _Memorials of the Abbey of St Mary of Fountains_,\r\n  collected and edited by J.R. Walbran (1863-78).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUQUE, FERDINAND ANDRE (1828-1904), French geologist and petrologist,\r\nwas born at Mortain, dept. of La Manche, on the 21st of June 1828. At\r\nthe age of twenty-one he entered the _Ecole Normale_ in Paris, and from\r\n1853 to 1858 he held the appointment of keeper of the scientific\r\ncollections. In 1877 he became professor of natural history at the\r\n_College de France_, in Paris, and in 1881 he was elected a member of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences. As a stratigraphical geologist he rendered much\r\nassistance on the Geological Survey of France, but in the course of time\r\nhe gave his special attention to the study of volcanic phenomena and\r\nearthquakes, to minerals and rocks; and he was the first to introduce\r\nmodern petrographical methods into France. His studies of the eruptive\r\nrocks of Corsica, Santorin and elsewhere; his researches on the\r\nartificial reproduction of eruptive rocks, and his treatise on the\r\noptical characters of felspars deserve special mention; but he was\r\nperhaps best known for the joint work which he carried on with his\r\nfriend Michel Levy. He died on the 7th of March 1904. His chief\r\npublications were: _Santorin et ses eruptions_, 1879; (with A. Michel\r\nLevy) _Mineralogie micrographique, Roches eruptives francaises_ (2\r\nvols., 1879); and _Synthese des mineraux et des roches_ (1882).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUQUE, FRIEDRICH HEINRICH KARL DE LA MOTTE, BARON (1777-1843), German\r\nwriter of the romantic movement, was born on the 12th of February 1777\r\nat Brandenburg. His grandfather had been one of Frederick the Great's\r\ngenerals and his father was a Prussian officer. Although not originally\r\nintended for a military career, Friedrich de la Motte Fouque ultimately\r\ngave up his university studies at Halle to join the army, and he took\r\npart in the Rhine campaign of 1794. The rest of his life was devoted\r\nmainly to literary pursuits. Like so many of the younger romanticists,\r\nFouque owed his introduction to literature to A.W. Schlegel, who\r\npublished his first book, _Dramatische Spiele von Pellegrin_ in 1804.\r\nHis next work, _Romanzen vom Tal Ronceval_ (1805), showed more plainly\r\nhis allegiance to the romantic leaders, and in the _Historie vom edlen\r\nRitter Galmy_ (1806) he versified a 16th-century romance of medieval\r\nchivalry. _Sigurd der Schlangentoter, ein Heldenspiel_ (1808), the first\r\nmodern German dramatization of the _Nibelungen_ saga, attracted\r\nattention to him, and influenced considerably subsequent versions of the\r\nstory, such as Hebbel's _Nibelungen_ and Wagner's _Ring des Nibelungen_.\r\nThese early writings indicate the lines which Fouque's subsequent\r\nliterary activity followed; his interests were divided between medieval\r\nchivalry on the one hand and northern mythology on the other. In 1813,\r\nthe year of the rising against Napoleon, he again fought with the\r\nPrussian army, and the new patriotism awakened in the German people left\r\nits mark upon his writings.\r\n\r\nBetween 1810 and 1815 Fouque's popularity was at its height; the many\r\nromances and novels, plays and epics, which he turned out with\r\nextraordinary rapidity, appealed exactly to the mood of the hour. The\r\nearliest of these are the best--_Undine_, which appeared in 1811, being,\r\nindeed, one of the most charming of all German _Marchen_ and the only\r\nwork by which Fouque's memory still lives to-day. A more comprehensive\r\nidea of his powers may, however, be obtained from the two romances _Der\r\nZauberring_ (1813) and _Die Fahrten Thiodulfs des Islanders_ (1815).\r\nFrom 1820 onwards the quality of Fouque's work rapidly degenerated,\r\npartly owing to the fatal ease with which he wrote, partly to his\r\ninability to keep pace with the changes in German taste. He remained the\r\nbelated romanticist, who, as the reading world turned to new interests,\r\nclung the more tenaciously to the paraphernalia of romanticism; but in\r\nthe cold, sober light of the post-romantic age, these appeared merely\r\nflimsy and theatrical. The vitalizing imaginative power of his early\r\nyears deserted him, and the sobriquet of a \"Don Quixote of Romanticism\"\r\nwhich his enemies applied to him was not unjustified.\r\n\r\nFouque's first marriage had been unhappy and soon ended in divorce. His\r\nsecond wife, Karoline von Briest (1773-1831) enjoyed some reputation as\r\na novelist in her day. After her death Fouque married a third time. Some\r\nconsolation for the ebbing tide of popular favour was afforded him by\r\nthe munificence of Frederick William IV. of Prussia, who granted him a\r\npension which allowed him to spend his later years in comfort. He died\r\nin Berlin on the 23rd of January 1843.\r\n\r\n  Fouque's _Ausgewahlte Werke_, edited by himself, appeared in 12 vols.\r\n  (Berlin, 1841); a selection, edited by M. Koch, will be found in\r\n  Kurschner's _Deutsche Nationalliteratur_, vol. 146, part ii.\r\n  (Stuttgart, 1893); _Undine_, _Sintram_, &c., in innumerable reprints.\r\n  Bibliography in Goedeke's _Grundriss zur Geschichte der deutschen\r\n  Dichtung_ (2nd ed., vi. pp. 115 ff., Dresden, 1898). Most of Fouque's\r\n  works have been translated, and the English versions of _Aslauga's\r\n  Knight_ (by Carlyle), _Sintram and his Companions_ and _Undine_, have\r\n  been frequently republished. For Fouque's life cp. _Lebensgeschichte\r\n  des Baron Friedrich de la Motte Fouque. Aufgezeichnet durch ihn\r\n  selbst_ (Halle, 1840), (only to the year 1813), and also the\r\n  introduction to Koch's selections in the _Deutsche Nationalliteratur_.\r\n       (J. G. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUQUET (or FOUCQUET), NICOLAS (1615-1680), viscount of Melun and of\r\nVaux, marquis of Belle-Isle, superintendent of finance in France under\r\nLouis XIV., was born at Paris in 1615. He belonged to an influential\r\nfamily of the _noblesse de la robe_, and after some preliminary\r\nschooling with the Jesuits, at the age of thirteen was admitted as\r\n_avocat_ at the parlement of Paris. While still in his teens he held\r\nseveral responsible posts, and in 1636, when just twenty, he was able to\r\nbuy the post of _maitre des requetes_. From 1642 to 1650 he held various\r\nintendancies at first in the provinces and then with the army of\r\nMazarin, and, coming thus in touch with the court, was permitted in 1650\r\nto buy the important position of _procureur general_ to the parlement of\r\nParis. During Mazarin's exile Fouquet shrewdly remained loyal to him,\r\nprotecting his property and keeping him informed of the situation at\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nUpon the cardinal's return, Fouquet demanded and received as reward the\r\noffice of superintendent of the finances (1653), a position which, in\r\nthe unsettled condition of the government, threw into his hands not\r\nmerely the decision as to which funds should be applied to meet the\r\ndemands of the state's creditors, but also the negotiations with the\r\ngreat financiers who lent money to the king. The appointment was a\r\npopular one with the moneyed class, for Fouquet's great wealth had been\r\nlargely augmented by his marriage in 1651 with Marie de Castille, who\r\nalso belonged to a wealthy family of the legal nobility. His own credit,\r\nand above all his unfailing confidence in himself, strengthened the\r\ncredit of the government, while his high position at the parlement (he\r\nstill remained _procureur general_) secured financial transactions from\r\ninvestigation. As minister of finance, he soon had Mazarin almost in the\r\nposition of a suppliant. The long wars, and the greed of the courtiers,\r\nwho followed the example of Mazarin, made it necessary at times for\r\nFouquet to meet the demands upon him by borrowing upon his own credit,\r\nbut he soon turned this confusion of the public purse with his own to\r\ngood account. The disorder in the accounts became hopeless; fraudulent\r\noperations were entered into with impunity, and the financiers were kept\r\nin the position of clients by official favours and by generous aid\r\nwhenever they needed it. Fouquet's fortune now surpassed even Mazarin's,\r\nbut the latter was too deeply implicated in similar operations to\r\ninterfere, and was obliged to leave the day of reckoning to his agent\r\nand successor Colbert. Upon Mazarin's death Fouquet expected to be made\r\nhead of the government; but Louis XIV. was suspicious of his poorly\r\ndissembled ambition, and it was with Fouquet in mind that he made the\r\nwell-known statement, upon assuming the government, that he would be his\r\nown chief minister. Colbert fed the king's displeasure with adverse\r\nreports upon the deficit, and made the worst of the case against\r\nFouquet. The extravagant expenditure and personal display of the\r\nsuperintendent served to intensify the ill-will of the king. Fouquet had\r\nbought the port of Belle Isle and strengthened the fortifications, with\r\na view to taking refuge there in case of disgrace. He had spent enormous\r\nsums in building a palace on his estate of Vaux, which in extent,\r\nmagnificence, and splendour of decoration was a forecast of Versailles.\r\nHere he gathered the rarest manuscripts, the finest paintings, jewels\r\nand antiques in profusion, and above all surrounded himself with artists\r\nand authors. The table was open to all people of quality, and the\r\nkitchen was presided over by Vatel. Lafontaine, Corneille, Scarron, were\r\namong the multitude of his clients. In August 1661 Louis XIV., already\r\nset upon his destruction, was entertained at Vaux with a _fete_ rivalled\r\nin magnificence by only one or two in French history, at which Moliere's\r\n_Les Facheux_ was produced for the first time. The splendour of the\r\nentertainment sealed Fouquet's fate. The king, however, was afraid to\r\nact openly against so powerful a minister. By crafty devices Fouquet was\r\ninduced to sell his office of _procureur general_, thus losing the\r\nprotection of its privileges, and he paid the price of it into the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after his visit to Vaux the king withdrew to Nantes, taking\r\nFouquet with him, and had him arrested when he was leaving the presence\r\nchamber, flattered with the assurance of his esteem. The trial lasted\r\nalmost three years, and its violation of the forms of justice is still\r\nthe subject of frequent monographs by members of the French bar. Public\r\nsympathy was strongly with Fouquet, and Lafontaine, Madame de Sevigne\r\nand many others wrote on his behalf; but when Fouquet was sentenced to\r\nbanishment, the king, disappointed, \"commuted\" the sentence to\r\nimprisonment for life. He was sent at the beginning of 1665 to the\r\nfortress of Pignerol, where he undoubtedly died on the 23rd of March\r\n1680.[1] Louis acted throughout \"as though he were conducting a\r\ncampaign,\" evidently fearing that Fouquet would play the part of a\r\nRichelieu. Fouquet bore himself with manly fortitude, and composed\r\nseveral mediocre translations in prison. The devotional works bearing\r\nhis name are apocryphal. A report of his trial was published in Holland,\r\nin 15 volumes, in 1665-1667, in spite of the remonstrances which Colbert\r\naddressed to the States-General. A second edition under the title of\r\n_Oeuvres de M. Fouquet_ appeared in 1696.\r\n\r\n  See Cheruel, _Memoires sur la vie publique et privee de Fouquet...\r\n  d'apres ses lettres et des pieces inedites_ (2 vols., Paris, 1864); J.\r\n  Lair, _Nicolas Foucquet, procureur general, surintendant des finances,\r\n  ministre d'Etat de Louis XIV_ (2 vols., Paris, 1890); U.V.

He seems to have early adopted revolutionary ideas, but little\r\nis known of the part he played at the outbreak of the Revolution. When\r\nthe Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris was established on the 10th of March\r\n1793, he was appointed public prosecutor to it, an office which he\r\nfilled until the 28th of July 1794. His activity during this time earned\r\nhim the reputation of one of the most terrible and sinister figures of\r\nthe Revolution. His function as public prosecutor was not so much to\r\nconvict the guilty as to see that the proscriptions ordered by the\r\nfaction for the time being in power were carried out with a due regard\r\nto a show of legality. He was as ruthless and as incorrupt as\r\nRobespierre himself; he could be moved from his purpose neither by pity\r\nnor by bribes; nor was there in his cruelty any of that quality which\r\nmade the ordinary Jacobin _enrage_ by turns ferocious and sentimental.\r\nIt was this very quality of passionless detachment that made him so\r\neffective an instrument of the Terror. He had no forensic eloquence; but\r\nthe cold obstinacy with which he pressed his charges was more convincing\r\nthan any rhetoric, and he seldom failed to secure a conviction.\r\n\r\nHis horrible career ended with the fall of Robespierre and the\r\nterrorists on the 9th Thermidor. On the 1st of August 1794 he was\r\nimprisoned by order of the Convention and brought to trial. His defence\r\nwas that he had only obeyed the orders of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety; but, after a trial which lasted forty-one days, he was condemned\r\nto death, and guillotined on the 7th of May 1795.\r\n\r\n  See _Memoire pour A.Q.

It owes its importance to its extensive\r\niron-works, established in 1821, which give employment to 2000 workmen\r\nand produce engineering material for railway, military and other\r\npurposes. Among the more remarkable _chefs-d'oeuvre_ which have been\r\nproduced at Fourchambault are the metal portions of the Pont du\r\nCarrousel, the iron beams of the roof of the cathedral at Chartres, and\r\nthe vast spans of the bridge over the Dordogne at Cubzac.

He took up medical studies by the\r\nadvice of the anatomist Felix Vicq d'Azyr (1748-1794), and after many\r\ndifficulties caused by lack of means finally in 1780 obtained his\r\ndoctor's diploma. His attention was specially turned to chemistry by\r\nJ.B.M. Bucquet (1746-1780), the professor of chemistry at the Medical\r\nSchool of Paris, and in 1784 he was chosen to succeed P.J. Macquer\r\n(1718-1784) as lecturer in chemistry at the college of the Jardin du\r\nRoi, where his lectures attained great popularity. He was one of the\r\nearliest converts to the views of Lavoisier, which he helped to\r\npromulgate by his voluminous writings, but though his name appears on a\r\nlarge number of chemical and also physiological and pathological\r\nmemoirs, either alone or with others, he was rather a teacher and an\r\norganizer than an original investigator. A member of the committees for\r\npublic instruction and public safety, and later, under Napoleon,\r\ndirector general of instruction, he took a leading part in the\r\nestablishment of schools for both primary and secondary education,\r\nscientific studies being especially provided for. Fourcroy died at Paris\r\non the 16th of December 1809, the very day on which he had been created\r\na count of the French empire. By his conduct as a member of the\r\nConvention he has been accused of contributing to the death of\r\nLavoisier. Baron Cuvier in his _Eloge historique_ of Fourcroy repels the\r\ncharge, but he can scarcely be acquitted of time-serving indifference,\r\nif indeed active, though secret, participation be not proved against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n  The Royal Society's _Catalogue of Scientific Papers_ enumerates 59\r\n  memoirs by Fourcroy himself, and 58 written jointly by him and others,\r\n  mostly L.N. Vauquelin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURIER, FRANCOIS CHARLES MARIE (1772-1837), French socialist writer,\r\nwas born at Besancon in Franche-Comte on the 7th of April 1772. His\r\nfather was a draper in good circumstances, and Fourier received an\r\nexcellent education at the college in his native town. After completing\r\nhis studies there he travelled for some time in France, Germany and\r\nHolland. On the death of his father he inherited a considerable amount\r\nof property, which, however, was lost when Lyons was besieged by the\r\ntroops of the Convention. Being thus deprived of his means of livelihood\r\nFourier entered the army, but after two years' service as a chasseur was\r\ndischarged on account of ill-health. In 1803 he published a remarkable\r\narticle on European politics which attracted the notice of Napoleon,\r\nsome of whose ideas were foreshadowed in it. Inquiries were made after\r\nthe author, but nothing seems to have come of them. After leaving the\r\narmy Fourier entered a merchant's office in Lyons, and some years later\r\nundertook on his own account a small business as broker. He obtained in\r\nthis way just sufficient to supply his wants, and devoted all his\r\nleisure time to the elaboration of his first work on the organization of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of his life, and while engaged in commerce, he had\r\nbecome deeply impressed with the conviction that social arrangements\r\nresulting from the principles of individualism and competition were\r\nessentially imperfect and immoral. He proposed to substitute for these\r\nprinciples co-operation or united effort, by means of which full and\r\nharmonious development might be given to human nature. The scheme,\r\nworked out in detail in his first work, _Theorie des quatre mouvements_\r\n(2 vols., Lyons, 1808, published anonymously), has for foundation a\r\nparticular psychological proposition and a special economical doctrine.\r\nPsychologically Fourier held what may with some laxity of language be\r\ncalled natural optimism,--the view that the full, free development of\r\nhuman nature or the unrestrained indulgence of human passion is the only\r\npossible way to happiness and virtue, and that misery and vice spring\r\nfrom the unnatural restraints imposed by society on the gratification of\r\ndesire. This principle of harmony among the passions he regarded as his\r\ngrandest discovery--a discovery which did more than set him on a level\r\nwith Newton, the discoverer of the principle of attraction or harmony\r\namong material bodies. Throughout his works, in uncouth, obscure and\r\noften unintelligible language, he endeavours to show that the same\r\nfundamental fact of harmony is to be found in the four great\r\ndepartments,--society, animal life, organic life and the material\r\nuniverse. In order to give effect to this principle and obtain the\r\nresulting social harmony, it was needful that society should be\r\nreconstructed; for, as the social organism is at present constituted,\r\ninnumerable restrictions are imposed upon the free development of human\r\ndesire. As practical principle for such a reconstruction Fourier\r\nadvocated co-operative or united industry. In many respects what he says\r\nof co-operation, in particular as to the enormous waste of economic\r\nforce which the actual arrangements of society entail, still deserves\r\nattention, and some of the most recent efforts towards extension of the\r\nco-operative method, e.g. to house-keeping, were in essentials\r\nanticipated by him. But the full realization of his scheme demanded much\r\nmore than the mere admission that co-operation is economically more\r\nefficacious than individualism. Society as a whole must be organized on\r\nthe lines requisite to give full scope to co-operation and to the\r\nharmonious evolution of human nature. The details of this reorganization\r\nof the social structure cannot be given briefly, but the broad outlines\r\nmay be thus sketched. Society, on his scheme, is to be divided into\r\ndepartments or _phalanges_, each _phalange_ numbering about 1600\r\npersons. Each _phalange_ inhabits a _phalanstere_ or common building,\r\nand has a certain portion of soil allotted to it for cultivation. The\r\n_phalansteres_ are built after a uniform plan, and the domestic\r\narrangements are laid down very elaborately. The staple industry of the\r\n_phalanges_ is, of course, agriculture, but the various _series_ and\r\n_groupes_ into which the members are divided may devote themselves to\r\nsuch occupations as are most to their taste; nor need any occupation\r\nbecome irksome from constant devotion to it. Any member of a group may\r\nvary his employment at pleasure, may pass from one task to another. The\r\ntasks regarded as menial or degrading in ordinary society can be\r\nrendered attractive if advantage is taken of the proper principles of\r\nhuman nature: thus children, who have a natural affinity for dirt, and a\r\nfondness for \"cleaning up,\" may easily be induced to accept with\r\neagerness the functions of public scavengers. It is not, on Fourier's\r\nscheme, necessary that private property should be abolished, nor is the\r\nprivacy of family life impossible within the _phalanstere_. Each family\r\nmay have separate apartments, and there may be richer and poorer\r\nmembers. But the rich and poor are to be locally intermingled, in order\r\nthat the broad distinction between them, which is so painful a feature\r\nin actual society, may become almost imperceptible. Out of the common\r\ngain of the _phalange_ a certain portion is deducted to furnish to each\r\nmember the minimum of subsistence; the remainder is distributed in\r\nshares to labour, capital and talent,--five-twelfths going to the first,\r\nfour-twelfths to the second and three-twelfths to the third. Upon the\r\nchanges requisite in the private life of the members Fourier was in his\r\nfirst work more explicit than in his later writings. The institution of\r\nmarriage, which imposes unnatural bonds on human passion, is of\r\nnecessity abolished; a new and ingeniously constructed system of licence\r\nis substituted for it. Considerable offence seems to have been given by\r\nFourier's utterances with regard to marriage, and generally the later\r\nadvocates of his views are content to pass the matter over in silence or\r\nto veil their teaching under obscure and metaphorical language.\r\n\r\nThe scheme thus sketched attracted no attention when the _Theorie_ first\r\nappeared, and for some years Fourier remained in his obscure position at\r\nLyons. In 1812 the death of his mother put him in possession of a small\r\nsum of money, with which he retired to Bellay in order to perfect his\r\nsecond work. The _Traite de l'association agricole domestique_ was\r\npublished in 2 vols. at Paris in 1822, and a summary appeared in the\r\nfollowing year. After its publication the author proceeded to Paris in\r\nthe hope that some wealthy capitalist might be induced to attempt the\r\nrealization of the projected scheme. Disappointed in this expectation he\r\nreturned to Lyons. In 1826 he again visited Paris, and as a considerable\r\nportion of his means had been expended in the publication of his book,\r\nhe accepted a clerkship in an American firm. In 1829 and 1830 appeared\r\nwhat is probably the most finished exposition of his views, _Le Nouveau\r\nMonde industriel_. In 1831 he attacked the rival socialist doctrines of\r\nSaint-Simon and Owen in the small work _Pieges et charlatanisme de deux\r\nsectes, St Simon et Owen_. His writings now began to attract some\r\nattention. A small body of adherents gathered round him, and the most\r\nardent of them was Victor Considerant (q.v.). In 1832 a newspaper, _Le\r\nPhalanstere ou la reforme industrielle_ was started to propagate the\r\nviews of the school, but its success was not great. In 1833 it declined\r\nfrom a weekly to a monthly, and in 1834 it died of inanition. It was\r\nrevived in 1836 as _Le Phalange_, and in 1843 became a daily paper, _La\r\nDemocratie pacifique_. In 1850 it was suppressed.\r\n\r\nFourier did not live to see the success of his newspaper, and the only\r\npractical attempt during his lifetime to establish a _phalanstere_ was a\r\ncomplete failure. In 1832 M. Baudet Dulary, deputy for Seine-et-Oise,\r\nwho had become a convert, purchased an estate at Conde-sur-Vesgre, near\r\nthe forest of Rambouillet, and proceeded to establish a socialist\r\ncommunity. The capital supplied was, however, inadequate, and the\r\ncommunity broke up in disgust. Fourier was in no way discouraged by this\r\nfailure, and till his death, on the 10th of October 1837, he lived in\r\ndaily expectation that wealthy capitalists would see the merits of his\r\nscheme and be induced to devote their fortunes to its realization. It\r\nmay be added that subsequent attempts to establish the _phalanstere_\r\nhave been uniformly unsuccessful.[1]\r\n\r\nFourier seems to have been of an extremely retiring and sensitive\r\ndisposition. He mixed little in society, and appeared, indeed, as if he\r\nwere the denizen of some other planet. Of the true nature of social\r\narrangements, and of the manner in which they naturally grow and become\r\norganized, he must be pronounced extremely ignorant. The faults of\r\nexisting institutions presented themselves to him in an altogether\r\ndistorted manner, and he never appears to have recognized that the evils\r\nof actual society are immeasurably less serious than the consequences of\r\nhis arbitrary scheme. Out of the chaos of human passion he supposed\r\nharmony was to be evolved by the adoption of a few theoretically\r\ndisputable principles, which themselves impose restraints even more\r\nirksome than those due to actual social facts. With regard to the\r\neconomic aspects of his proposed new method, it is of course to be\r\ngranted that co-operation is more effective than individual effort, but\r\nhe has nowhere faced the question as to the probable consequences of\r\norganizing society on the abolition of those great institutions which\r\nhave grown with its growth. His temperament was too ardent, his\r\nimagination too strong, and his acquaintance with the realities of life\r\ntoo slight to enable him justly to estimate the merits of his fantastic\r\nviews. That this description of him is not expressed in over-strong\r\nlanguage must be clear to any one who not only considers what is true in\r\nhis works,--and the portion of truth is by no means a peculiar discovery\r\nof Fourier's,--but who takes into account the whole body of his\r\nspeculations, the cosmological and historical as well as the economical\r\nand social. No words can adequately describe the fantastic nonsense\r\nwhich he pours forth, partly in the form of general speculation on the\r\nuniverse, partly in the form of prophetic utterances with regard to the\r\nfuture changes in humanity and its material environment. From these\r\nextraordinary writings it is no extreme conclusion that there was much\r\nof insanity in Fourier's mental constitution.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Ch.

Indeed, in the\r\n    years between 1840 and 1850, during which the movement waxed and\r\n    waned, no fewer than forty-one _phalanges_ were founded, of which\r\n    some definite record can be found. The most interesting of all the\r\n    experiments, not alone from its own history, but also from the fact\r\n    that it attracted the support of many of the most intellectual and\r\n    cultured Americans was that of Brook Farm (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURIER, JEAN BAPTISTE JOSEPH (1768-1830), French mathematician, was\r\nborn at Auxerre on the 21st of March 1768. He was the son of a tailor,\r\nand was left an orphan in his eighth year; but, through the kindness of\r\na friend, admission was gained for him into the military school of his\r\nnative town, which was then under the direction of the Benedictines of\r\nSaint-Maur. He soon distinguished himself as a student and made rapid\r\nprogress, especially in mathematics. Debarred from entering the army on\r\naccount of his lowness of birth and poverty, he was appointed professor\r\nof mathematics in the school in which he had been a pupil. In 1787 he\r\nbecame a novice at the abbey of St Benoit-sur-Loire; but he left the\r\nabbey in 1789 and returned to his college, where, in addition to his\r\nmathematical duties, he was frequently called to lecture on other\r\nsubjects,--rhetoric, philosophy and history. On the institution of the\r\nEcole Normale at Paris in 1795 he was sent to teach in it, and was\r\nafterwards attached to the Ecole Polytechnique, where he occupied the\r\nchair of analysis. Fourier was one of the savants who accompanied\r\nBonaparte to Egypt in 1798; and during this expedition he was called to\r\ndischarge important political duties in addition to his scientific ones.\r\nHe was for a time virtually governor of half Egypt, and for three years\r\nwas secretary of the Institut du Caire; he also delivered the funeral\r\norations for Kleber and Desaix. He returned to France in 1801, and in\r\nthe following year he was nominated prefect of Isere, and was created\r\nbaron and chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He took an important part\r\nin the preparation of the famous _Description de l'Egypte_ and wrote the\r\nhistorical introduction. He held his prefecture for fourteen years; and\r\nit was during this period that he carried on his elaborate and fruitful\r\ninvestigations on the conduction of heat. On the return of Napoleon from\r\nElba, in 1815, Fourier published a royalist proclamation, and left\r\nGrenoble as Napoleon entered it. He was then deprived of his prefecture,\r\nand, although immediately named prefect of the Rhone, was soon after\r\nagain deprived. He now settled at Paris, was elected to the Academie des\r\nSciences in 1816, but in consequence of the opposition of Louis XVIII.\r\nwas not admitted till the following year, when he succeeded the Abbe\r\nAlexis de Rochon. In 1822 he was made perpetual secretary in conjunction\r\nwith Cuvier, in succession to Delambre. In 1826 Fourier became a member\r\nof the French Academy, and in 1827 succeeded Laplace as president of the\r\ncouncil of the Ecole Polytechnique. In 1828 he became a member of the\r\ngovernment commission established for the encouragement of literature.\r\nHe died at Paris on the 16th of May 1830.\r\n\r\nAs a politician Fourier achieved uncommon success, but his fame chiefly\r\nrests on his strikingly original contributions to science and\r\nmathematics. The theory of heat engaged his attention quite early, and\r\nin 1812 he obtained a prize offered by the Academie des Sciences with a\r\nmemoir in two parts, _Theorie des mouvements de la chaleur dans les\r\ncorps solides_. The first part was republished in 1822 as _La Theorie\r\nanalytique de la chaleur_, which by its new methods and great results\r\nmade an epoch in the history of mathematical and physical science (see\r\nbelow: FOURIER'S SERIES). An English translation has been published by\r\nA. Freeman (Cambridge, 1872), and a German by Weinstein (Berlin, 1884).\r\nHis mathematical researches were also concerned with the theory of\r\nequations, but the question as to his priority on several points has\r\nbeen keenly discussed. After his death Navier completed and published\r\nFourier's unfinished work, _Analyse des equations indeterminees_ (1831),\r\nwhich contains much original matter. In addition to the works above\r\nmentioned, Fourier wrote many memoirs on scientific subjects, and\r\n_eloges_ of distinguished men of science. His works have been collected\r\nand edited by Gaston Darboux with the title _Oeuvres de Fourier_ (Paris,\r\n1889-1890).\r\n\r\n  For a list of Fourier's publications see the _Catalogue of Scientific\r\n  Papers of the Royal Society of London_. Reference may also be made to\r\n  Arago, \"Joseph Fourier,\" in the _Smithsonian Report_ (1871).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURIER'S SERIES, in mathematics, those series which proceed according\r\nto sines and cosines of multiples of a variable, the various multiples\r\nbeing in the ratio of the natural numbers; they are used for the\r\nrepresentation of a function of the variable for values of the variable\r\nwhich lie between prescribed finite limits. Although the importance of\r\nsuch series, especially in the theory of vibrations, had been recognized\r\nby D. Bernoulli, Lagrange and other mathematicians, and had led to some\r\ndiscussion of their properties, J.B.J. Fourier (see above) was the first\r\nclearly to recognize the arbitrary character of the functions which the\r\nseries can represent, and to make any serious attempt to prove the\r\nvalidity of such representation; the series are consequently usually\r\nassociated with the name of Fourier. More general cases of\r\ntrigonometrical series, in which the multiples are given as the roots of\r\ncertain transcendental equations, were also considered by Fourier.\r\n\r\n  Before proceeding to the consideration of the special class of series\r\n  to be discussed, it is necessary to define with some precision what is\r\n  to be understood by the representation of an arbitrary function by an\r\n  infinite series. Suppose a function of a variable x to be arbitrarily\r\n  given for values of x between two fixed values a and b; this means\r\n  that, corresponding to every value of x such that a <= x <= b, a\r\n  definite arithmetical value of the function is assigned by means of\r\n  some prescribed set of rules. A function so defined may be denoted by\r\n  [f](x); the rules by which the values of the function are determined\r\n  may be embodied in a single explicit analytical formula, or in several\r\n  such formulae applicable to different portions of the interval, but it\r\n  would be an undue restriction of the nature of an arbitrarily given\r\n  function to assume _a priori_ that it is necessarily given in this\r\n  manner, the possibility of the representation of such a function by\r\n  means of a single analytical expression being the very point which we\r\n  have to discuss. The variable x may be represented by a point at the\r\n  extremity of an interval measured along a straight line from a fixed\r\n  origin; thus we may speak of the point c as synonymous with the value\r\n  x = c of the variable, and of [f](c) as the value of the function\r\n  assigned to the point c. For any number of points between a and b the\r\n  function may be discontinuous, i.e. it may at such points undergo\r\n  abrupt changes of value; it will here be assumed that the number of\r\n  such points is finite. The only discontinuities here considered will\r\n  be those known as ordinary discontinuities. Such a discontinuity\r\n  exists at the point c if [f](c + [epsilon]), [f](c - [epsilon]) have\r\n  distinct but definite limiting values as [epsilon] is indefinitely\r\n  diminished; these limiting values are known as the limits on the right\r\n  and on the left respectively of the function at c, and may be denoted\r\n  by [f](c + 0), [f](c - 0). The discontinuity consists therefore of a\r\n  sudden change of value of the function from [f](c - 0) to [f](c + 0),\r\n  as x increases through the value c. If there is such a discontinuity\r\n  at the point x = 0, we may denote the limits on the right and on the\r\n  left respectively by [f](+0), [f](-0).\r\n\r\n  Suppose we have an infinite series u1(x) + u2(x) + ... + u_n(x) + ...\r\n  in which each term is a function of x, of known analytical form; let\r\n  any value x = c(a = c = b) be substituted in the terms of the series,\r\n  and suppose the sum of n terms of the arithmetical series so obtained\r\n  approaches a definite limit as n is indefinitely increased; this limit\r\n  is known as the sum of the series. If for every value of c such that a\r\n  <= c <= b the sum exists and agrees with the value of [f](c), the\r\n  series [Sigma] [1 to [oo]] u_n(x) is said to represent the function\r\n  ([f]x) between the values a, b of the variable. If this is the case\r\n  for all points within the given interval with the exception of a\r\n  finite number, at any one of which either the series has no sum, or\r\n  has a sum which does not agree with the value of the function, the\r\n  series is said to represent \"in general\" the function for the given\r\n  interval. If the sum of n terms of the series be denoted by S_n(c),\r\n  the condition that S_n(c) converges to the value [f](c) is that,\r\n  corresponding to any finite positive number [delta] as small as we\r\n  please, a value n1 of n can be found such that if n >= n_1, |[f](c) -\r\n  Sn(c)| < [delta].\r\n\r\n  Functions have also been considered which for an infinite number of\r\n  points within the given interval have no definite value, and series\r\n  have also been discussed which at an infinite number of points in the\r\n  interval cease either to have a sum, or to have one which agrees with\r\n  the value of the function; the narrower conception above will however\r\n  be retained in the treatment of the subject in this article, reference\r\n  to the wider class of cases being made only in connexion with the\r\n  history of the theory of Fourier's Series.\r\n\r\n  _Uniform Convergence of Series._--If the series u1(x) + u2(x) + ... +\r\n  u2(x) + ... converge for every value of x in a given interval a to b,\r\n  and its sum be denoted by S(x), then if, corresponding to a finite\r\n  positive number [delta], as small as we please, a finite number n1 can\r\n  be found such that the arithmetical value of S(x) - S_n(x), where n =>\r\n  n1 is less than [delta] for every value of x in the given interval,\r\n  the series is said to converge uniformly in that interval. It may\r\n  however happen that as x approaches a particular value the number of\r\n  terms of the series which must be taken so that |S(x) - S_n(x)| may be\r\n  < [delta], increases indefinitely; the convergence of the series is\r\n  then infinitely slow in the neighbourhood of such a point, and the\r\n  series is not uniformly convergent throughout the given interval,\r\n  although it converges at each point of the interval. If the number of\r\n  such points in the neighbourhood of which the series ceases to\r\n  converge uniformly be finite, they may be excluded by taking intervals\r\n  of finite magnitude as small as we please containing such points, and\r\n  considering the convergence of the series in the given interval with\r\n  such sub-intervals excluded; the convergence of the series is now\r\n  uniform throughout the remainder of the interval. The series is said\r\n  to be _in general_ uniformly convergent within the given interval a to\r\n  b if it can be made uniformly convergent by the exclusion of a finite\r\n  number of portions of the interval, each such portion being\r\n  arbitrarily small. It is known that the sum of an infinite series of\r\n  continuous terms can be discontinuous only at points in the\r\n  neighbourhood of which the convergence of the series is not uniform,\r\n  but non-uniformity of convergence of the series does not necessarily\r\n  imply discontinuity in the sum.\r\n\r\n  _Form of Fourier's Series._--If it be assumed that a function [f](x)\r\n  arbitrarily given for values of x such that o[<=]x[<=]l is capable of\r\n  being represented in general by an infinite series of the form\r\n\r\n           [pi]x          2[pi]x                 n[pi]x\r\n    A1 sin ----- + A2 sin ------ + ... + A_n sin ------ + ...,\r\n             l              l                      l\r\n\r\n  and if it be further assumed that the series is in general uniformly\r\n  convergent throughout the interval 0 to l, the form of the\r\n  coefficients A can be determined. Multiply each term of the series by\r\n  sin n[pi]x/l, and integrate the product between the limits 0 and l,\r\n  then in virtue of the property [int][l to 0] sin n[pi]x/l sin\r\n  n'[pi]x/l dx=0, or 1/2 l, according as n' is not, or is, equal to n,\r\n  we have -1/2 lA_n= [int][0 to l] [f](x) sin n[pi]x/l dx, and thus the\r\n  series is of the form\r\n\r\n                             _\r\n    2       [oo]    n[pi]x  / l        n[pi]x\r\n    -- [Sigma]  sin ------  |   [f](x) ------ dx.

This assumption being\r\n  made, it is further assumed that [f](x) is such that [integral][0 to\r\n  l] [f](x)sin n[pi]x/l dx has a definite meaning for every value of n.\r\n\r\n  Before we proceed to examine the justification for the assumptions\r\n  made, it is desirable to examine the result obtained, and to deduce\r\n  other series from it.

In the first place, the series of sines has a vanishing sum\r\n  when x=o or x=l; it therefore does not represent the function at the\r\n  point x=o, unless [f](0) = 0, or at the point x=l, unless [f](l) = 0,\r\n  whereas the series (2) of cosines may represent the function at both\r\n  these points. Again, let us consider what is represented by (1) and\r\n  (2) for values of x which do not lie between 0 and l. As [f](x) is\r\n  given only for values of x between 0 and l, the series at points\r\n  beyond these limits have no necessary connexion with [f](x) unless we\r\n  suppose that [f](x) is also given for such general values of x in such\r\n  a way that the series continue to represent that function. If in (1)\r\n  we change x into -x, leaving the coefficients unaltered, the series\r\n  changes sign, and if x be changed into x + 2l, the series is\r\n  unaltered; we infer that the series (1) represents an odd function of\r\n  x and is periodic of period 2l; thus (1) will represent [f](x) in\r\n  general for values of x between [+-][oo], only if [f](x) is odd and\r\n  has a period 2l. If in (2) we change x into -x, the series is\r\n  unaltered, and it is also unaltered by changing x into x + 2l; from\r\n  this we see that the series (2) represents [f](x) for values of x\r\n  between [+-][oo], only if [f](x) is an even function, and is periodic\r\n  of period 2l. In general a function [f](x) arbitrarily given for all\r\n  values of x between [+-][oo] is neither periodic nor odd, nor even,\r\n  and is therefore not represented by either (1) or (2) except for the\r\n  interval 0 to l.\r\n\r\n  From (1) and (2) we can deduce a series containing both sines and\r\n  cosines, which will represent a function [f](x) arbitrarily given in\r\n  the interval -l to l, for that interval. We can express by (1) the\r\n  function -1/2{[f](x) - [f](-x)} which is an odd function, and thus this\r\n  function is represented for the interval -l to +l by\r\n                           _\r\n    2              n[pi]x / l                           n[pi]x\r\n    -- [Sigma] sin ------ |  1/2 {[f](x) - [f](-x)} sin ------ dx;\r\n    l                 l  _/ 0                              l\r\n\r\n  we can also express 1/2 {[f](x) + [f](-x)}, which is an even function,\r\n  by means of (2), thus for the interval -l to +l this function is\r\n  represented by\r\n        _                                                     _\r\n    1  / l                             2      [oo]    n[pi]x / l                            n[pi]x\r\n    -- |   1/2 {[f](x) + [f](-x)} dx + -- [Sigma] cos ------ |   1/2 {[f](x) + [f](-x)} cos ------ dx.\r\n    l _/ 0                             l         1       l  _/ 0                               l\r\n\r\n  It must be observed that [f](-x) is absolutely independent of [f](x),\r\n  the former being not necessarily deducible from the latter by putting\r\n  -x for x in a formula; both [f](x) and [f](-x) are functions given\r\n  arbitrarily and independently for the interval 0 to l. On adding the\r\n  expressions together we obtain a series of sines and cosines which\r\n  represents [f](x) for the interval -l to l.

The series\r\n  represents the function at x=o, unless the function is there\r\n  discontinuous, in which case the series is 1/2 {[f](+0) + [f](-0)};\r\n  the series does not necessarily represent the function at the points l\r\n  and -l, unless [f](l) = [f](-l).

It will be convenient throughout to take -[pi] to [pi] as\r\n  the given interval; any interval -l to l may be reduced to this by\r\n  changing x into lx/[pi], and thus there is no loss of generality.\r\n\r\n  We find by an elementary process that\r\n\r\n    1/2 + cos (x - x') + cos 2(x - x') + ... + cos n(x - x')\r\n\r\n          2n + 1\r\n      sin ------ (x' - x)\r\n             2\r\n    = -------------------.\r\n       2 sin 1/2(x' - x)\r\n\r\n  Hence, with the new notation, the sum of the first n+1 terms of (3) is\r\n          _\r\n     1   / [pi]        sin (2n + 1)/2 (x' - x)\r\n    ---- |     [f](x') ----------------------- dx'.\r\n    [pi]_/-[pi]           2 sin 1/2 (x' - x)\r\n\r\n  If we suppose [f](x) to be continued beyond the interval -[pi] to\r\n  [pi], in such a way that [f](x) = [f](x + 2[pi]), we may replace the\r\n  limits in this integral by x + [pi], x-[pi] respectively; if we then\r\n  put x' - x = 2z, and let [f](x') = [F](z), the expression becomes\r\n  1/[pi] [int][-[pi]/2 to [pi]/2] F(z) (sin mz/sin z) dz, where m = 2n +\r\n  1; this expression may be written in the form\r\n          _                            _\r\n     1   /[pi]/2     sin mz        1  /[pi]/2      sin mz\r\n    ---- |      F(z) ------ dz + ---- |      F(-z) ------ dz.

This\r\n  integral, or rather the slightly more general one [int][0 to h]\r\n  F(z)(sin mz/sin z) dz, when 0 < h <= 1/2[pi], is known as Dirichlet's\r\n  integral. If we write X(z)= F(z)(z/sin z), the integral becomes\r\n  [int][0 to h] X(z)(sin mz/z) dz, which is the form in which the\r\n  integral is frequently considered.\r\n\r\n  _The Second Mean-Value Theorem._--The limiting value of Dirichlet's\r\n  integral may be conveniently investigated by means of a theorem in the\r\n  integral calculus known as the second mean-value theorem. Let a, b be\r\n  two fixed finite numbers such that a<b, and suppose [f](x), [phi](x)\r\n  are two functions which have finite and determinate values everywhere\r\n  in the interval except for a finite number of points; suppose further\r\n  that the functions [f](x), [phi](x) are integrable throughout the\r\n  interval, and that as x increases from a to b the function [f](x) is\r\n  monotone, i.e. either never diminishes or never increases; the theorem\r\n  is that\r\n      _                                  _                             _\r\n     / b                                /[xi]                         / b\r\n     |  [f](x) [phi](x) dx = [f](a + 0) |    [phi](x) dx + [f](b - 0) |   [phi](x) dx\r\n    _/ a                               _/ a                          _/[xi]\r\n\r\n  when [xi] is some point between a and b, and [f](a), [f](b) may be\r\n  written for [f](a + 0), [f](b - 0) unless a or b is a point of\r\n  discontinuity of the function [f](x).\r\n\r\n  To prove this theorem, we observe that, since the product of two\r\n  integrable functions is an integrable function, [int][a to b] [f](x)\r\n  [phi](x) dx exists, and may be regarded as the limit of the sum of a\r\n  series [f](x0) [phi](x0) (x1 - x0) + [f](x1) [phi](x1) (x2 - x1) + ...\r\n  + [f]x(n-1) [phi]x_(n-1) (x_n - x_(n-1)) where x0 = a, x_n = b and x1,\r\n  x2 ... x_(n-1) are n - 1 intermediate points. We can express\r\n  [phi](x_r) (x_(r+1) - x_r) in the form Y_(r+1) - Y_r, by putting\r\n\r\n               K=r\r\n    Y_r = [Sigma] [phi](x_(K-1)) (x_K - x_(K-1)), Y0 = 0.\r\n               K=1\r\n\r\n  Writing X_r for [f](x_r), the series becomes\r\n\r\n    X0(Y1 - Y0) + X1(Y2 - Y1) + ... + X_(n-1)(Y_n - Y_(n-1))\r\n\r\n  or Y1(X0 - X1) + Y2(X1 - X2) + ... + Y_n(X_(n-1) - X_n) + Y_n X_n.\r\n\r\n  Now, by supposition, all the numbers Y1, Y2 ... Y_n are finite, and\r\n  all the numbers X_(r-1) - X_r are of the same sign, hence by a known\r\n  algebraical theorem the series is equal to M(X0 - X_n) + Y_n X_n,\r\n  where M is a number intermediate between the greatest and the least of\r\n  the numbers Y1, Y2, ... Y_n. This remains true however many partial\r\n  intervals are taken, and therefore, when their number is increased\r\n  indefinitely, and their breadths are diminished indefinitely according\r\n  to any law, we have\r\n      _                                                   _\r\n     / b                                      _          / b\r\n     |  [f](x)[phi](x)dx = {[f](a) - [f](b)}  M + [f](b) |  [phi](x) dx\r\n    _/ a                                                _/ a\r\n\r\n  when M is intermediate between the greatest and least values which\r\n  [int][a to x] [phi](x) dx can have, when x is in the given integral.\r\n  Now this integral is a continuous function of its upper limit x, and\r\n  therefore there is a value of x in the interval, for which it takes\r\n  any particular value between the greatest and least values that it\r\n  has. There is therefore a value [xi] between a and b, such that\r\n\r\n         _\r\n    _   /[xi]\r\n    M = |    [phi](x)dx,\r\n       _/ a\r\n\r\n  hence\r\n      _                                         _                        _\r\n     / b                                       /[xi]                    / b\r\n     |  [f](x) [phi](x) dx = {[f](a) - [f](b)} |   [phi](x) dx + [f](b) |  [phi](x) dx\r\n    _/ a                                      _/ a                     _/ a\r\n                _                         _\r\n               /[xi]                     / b\r\n      = [f](a) |    [phi](x) dx + [f](b) |    [phi](x) dx.\r\n              _/ a                      _/[xi]\r\n\r\n  If the interval contains any finite numbers of points of discontinuity\r\n  of [f](x) or [phi](x), the method of proof still holds good, provided\r\n  these points are avoided in making the subdivisions; in particular if\r\n  either of the ends be a point of discontinuity of [f](x), we write\r\n  [f](a + 0) or [f](b - 0), for [f](a) or [f](b), it being assumed that\r\n  these limits exist.\r\n\r\n  _Functions, with Limited Variation._--The condition that [f](x), in\r\n  the mean-value theorem, either never increases or never diminishes as\r\n  x increases from a to b, places a restriction upon the applications of\r\n  the theorem. We can, however, show that a function [f](x) which is\r\n  finite and continuous between a and b, except for a finite number of\r\n  ordinary discontinuities, and which only changes from increasing to\r\n  diminishing or vice versa, a finite number of times, as x increases\r\n  from a to b, may be expressed as the difference of two functions\r\n  [f]1(x), [f]2(x), neither of which ever diminishes as x passes from a\r\n  to b, and that these functions are finite and continuous, except that\r\n  one or both of them are discontinuous at the points where the given\r\n  function is discontinuous. Let [alpha], [beta] be two consecutive\r\n  points at which [f](x) is discontinuous, consider any point x1, such\r\n  that [alpha] <= x1 <= [beta], and suppose that at the points M1, M2\r\n  ... M_r between [alpha] and x1, [f](x) is a maximum, and at m1, m2 ...\r\n  m_r, it is a minimum; we will suppose, for example, that the ascending\r\n  order of values is [alpha], M1, m1, M2, m2 ... M_r, m_r, x1; it will\r\n  make no essential difference in the argument if m1 comes before M1, or\r\n  if M_r immediately precedes x1, M_(r-1) being then the last minimum.\r\n\r\n  Let [psi](x1) = [[f](M1) - [f]([alpha] + 0)] + [[f](M2) - [f](m1)]+ ...\r\n    +[[f](M_r) - [f](m_(r-1))] + [[f](x1) - [f](m_r)];\r\n\r\n  now let (x1) increase until it reaches the value (M_(r+1)) at which\r\n  [f](x) is again a maximum, then let\r\n\r\n    [psi](x1) = [[f](M1) - [f]([alpha] + 0)] + [[f](M2) - [f](m1)] + ...\r\n      + [[f](M_r) - [f](m_(r-1)] + [[f](M_(r+1)) - [f](m_r)];\r\n\r\n  and suppose as x increases beyond the value M_(r+1), [psi](x1) remains\r\n  constant until the next minimum m_(r+1) is reached, when it again\r\n  becomes variable; we see that [psi](x1) is essentially positive and\r\n  never diminishes as x increases.\r\n\r\n  Let\r\n\r\n    [chi](x1) = [[f](M1) - f(m1)] + [[f](M2) - [f](m1)] + ... + [[f](M_r)\r\n      - [f](m_r)],\r\n\r\n  then let x1 increase until it is beyond the next maximum M_(r+1), and\r\n  then let\r\n\r\n    [chi](x1) = [[f](M1) - [f](m1)] + [[f](M2) - [f](m1)] + ... +\r\n      [[f](M_r) - [f](m_r)] + [[f](M_(r+1)) - [f](x1)]\r\n\r\n  thus [chi](x1) never diminishes, and is alternately constant and\r\n  variable. We see that [psi](x1) - [chi](x1) is continuous as x1\r\n  increases from [alpha] to [beta], and that [psi](x1) - [chi](x1) =\r\n  [f](x1) - [f]([alpha] + 0), and when x1 reaches [beta], we have\r\n  [psi]([beta]) - [chi](x1) = [f]([beta] - 0) - [f]([alpha] + 0). Hence\r\n  it is seen that between [alpha] and [beta], [f](x) = [[psi](x) +\r\n  [f]([alpha] + 0)] - [chi](x), where [psi](x) + [f]([alpha] + 0),\r\n  [chi](x) are continuous and never diminish as x increases; the same\r\n  reasoning applies to every continuous portion of [f](x), for which\r\n  the functions [psi](x), [chi](x) are formed in the same manner; we now\r\n  take [f]1(x)=[psi](x) + [f]([alpha] + 0) + C, [f]2(x) = [chi](x) + C,\r\n  where C is constant between consecutive discontinuities, but may have\r\n  different values in the next interval between discontinuities; the C\r\n  can be so chosen that neither [f]1(x) nor [f]2(x) diminishes as x\r\n  increases through a value for which [f](x) is discontinuous. We thus\r\n  see that [f](x) = [f]1(x) - [f]2(x), where [f]1(x), [f]2(x) never\r\n  diminish as x increases from a to b, and are discontinuous only where\r\n  [f](x) is so. The function [f](x) is a particular case of a class of\r\n  functions defined and discussed by Jordan, under the name \"functions\r\n  with limited variation\" (_fonctions a variation bornee_); in general\r\n  such functions have not necessarily only a finite number of maxima and\r\n  minima.\r\n\r\n  _Proof of the Convergence of Fourier's Series._--It will now be\r\n  assumed that a function [f](x) arbitrarily given between the values\r\n  -[pi] and +[pi], has the following properties:--\r\n\r\n  (a) The function is everywhere numerically less than some fixed\r\n  positive number, and continuous except for a finite number of values\r\n  of the variable, for which it may be ordinarily discontinuous.\r\n\r\n  (b) The function only changes from increasing to diminishing or vice\r\n  versa, a finite number of times within the interval; this is usually\r\n  expressed by saying that the number of maxima and minima is finite.\r\n\r\n  These limitations on the nature of the function are known as\r\n  Dirichlet's conditions; it follows from them that the function is\r\n  integrable throughout the interval.\r\n\r\n  On these assumptions, we can investigate the limiting value of\r\n  Dirichlet's integral; it will be necessary to consider only the case\r\n  of a function F(z) which does not diminish as z increases from 0 to\r\n  1/2[pi], since it has been shown that in the general case the\r\n  difference of two such functions may be taken.

If\r\n  [epsilon] be an arbitrarily chosen positive number, a fixed value of\r\n  [mu] may be so chosen that [pi]G([mu)] < 1/2[epsilon], and thus that\r\n        _\r\n    |  /[mu]     sin mz   |\r\n    |  |    G(z) ------ dz| < 1/2[epsilon].\r\n    | _/0           z     |\r\n\r\n  When [mu] has been so fixed, m may now be so chosen that\r\n        _\r\n    |  /1/2[pi]   sin mz      [pi]     |\r\n    |  |     F(z) ------ dz - ---- F(0)| < [epsilon].\r\n    | _/0          sin z       2       |\r\n\r\n  It has now been shown that when m is indefinitely increased\r\n      _\r\n     /[pi]/2     sin mz      [pi]\r\n     |      F(z) ------ dz - ---- F(0) has the limit zero.\r\n    _/ 0          sin z        2\r\n\r\n  Returning to the form (4), we now see that the limiting value of\r\n          _                             _\r\n      1  /[pi]/2     sin mz         1  /[pi]/2      sin mz\r\n    ---- |      F(z) ------ dz  + ---- |      F(-z) ------ dz\r\n    [pi]_/ 0          sin z       [pi]_/ 0           sin z\r\n\r\n  1/2{F(+0) + F(-0)}; hence the sum of n + 1 terms of the series\r\n         _                         _\r\n    1   / l            1          / l            n[pi](x - x^1)\r\n    --  |  [f](x) dx + -- [Sigma] |  [f](x^1) cos ------------- dx\r\n    2l _/-l            l         _/-l                   l\r\n\r\n  converges to the value 1/2 {[f](x + 0) + [f](x - 0)}, or to [f](x) at\r\n  a point where [f](x) is continuous, provided [f](x) satisfies\r\n  Dirichlet's conditions for the interval from -l to l.\r\n\r\n  _Proof that Fourier's Series is in General Uniformly Convergent._--To\r\n  prove that Fourier's Series converges uniformly to its sum for all\r\n  values of x, provided that the immediate neighbourhoods of the points\r\n  of discontinuity of [f](x) are excluded, we have\r\n        _\r\n    |  /[pi]/2   sin mz      [pi]     |                      4\r\n    |  |     F(z)------ dz - ---- F(0)| < [pi]G ([mu]) + ---------- {F([mu] + 0) - F(0)}\r\n    | _/          sin z        2      |                  m sin [mu]\r\n\r\n             4\r\n      + ------------ {F(1/2[pi] - 0) - F(0)}\r\n        m sin [xi]^1\r\n\r\n      [pi][mu]                                4\r\n    < -------- {[f](x + 2[mu]) - [f](x)} + ---------- {[f](x + 2[mu]) - [f](x)}\r\n      sin [mu]                             m sin [mu]\r\n\r\n             4\r\n      + ------------ {[f](x + [pi]) - [f](x)}\r\n        m sin [xi]^1\r\n\r\n  Using this inequality and the corresponding one for F(-z), we have\r\n\r\n    |S_(2n+1)(x) - [f](x)| < [mu] cosec [mu] [|[f](x + 2[mu]) - [f](x)|\r\n      + |[f](x - 2[mu]) - [f](x)|] + A|m cosec [mu],\r\n\r\n  where A is some fixed number independent of m. In any interval (a, b)\r\n  in which [f](x) is continuous, a value [mu]1 of [mu] can be chosen\r\n  such that, for every value of x in (a, b), |[f](x + 2[mu]) - [f](x)|,\r\n  |[f](x - 2[mu]) - [f](x)| are less than an arbitrarily prescribed\r\n  positive number [epsilon], provided [mu] = [mu]1. Also a value [mu]2\r\n  of [mu] can be so chosen that [epsilon][mu]2 cosec [mu]2 < 1/2[eta],\r\n  where [eta] is an arbitrarily assigned positive number. Take for [mu]\r\n  the lesser of the numbers [mu]1, [mu]2, then |S_(2n+1) - [f](x)| <\r\n  [eta] + A|m cosec [mu] for every value of x in (a, b). It follows\r\n  that, since [eta] and m are independent of x, |S_(2n+1) - [f](x)| <\r\n  2[epsilon], provided n is greater than some fixed value n1 dependent\r\n  only on [epsilon]. Therefore S_(2n+1) converges to [f](x) uniformly in\r\n  the interval (a, b).\r\n\r\n  _Case of a Function with Infinities._--The limitation that [f](x) must\r\n  be numerically less than a fixed positive number throughout the\r\n  interval may, under a certain restriction, be removed. Suppose F(z) is\r\n  indefinitely great in the neighbourhood of the point z = c, and is\r\n\r\n  such that the limits of the two integrals [int][c to c[+-][epsilon]]\r\n  F(z) dz are both zero, as [epsilon] is indefinitely diminished, then\r\n\r\n      _\r\n     /[pi]/2     sin mz\r\n     |      F(z) ------ dz\r\n    _/ 0          sin z\r\n\r\n  denotes the limit when [epsilon] = 0, [epsilon]^1 = 0 of\r\n      _                          _\r\n     /c-[epsilon]   sin mz      /[pi]/2           sin mz\r\n     |         F(z) ------ dx + |            F(z) ------ dz,\r\n    _/ 0             sin z     _/c+[epsilon]^1     sin z\r\n\r\n  both these limits existing; the first of these integrals has\r\n  1/2[pi]F(+0) for its limiting value when m is indefinitely increased,\r\n  and the second has zero for its limit. The theorem therefore holds if\r\n  F(z) has an infinity up to which it is absolutely integrable; this\r\n  will, for example, be the case if F(z) near the point C is of the form\r\n  x(z)(z - c)^-[mu] + [psi](z), where [chi](c), [psi](c) are finite, and\r\n  0 < [mu] < 1. It is thus seen that [f](x) may have a finite number of\r\n  infinities within the given interval, provided the function is\r\n  integrable through any one of these points; the function is in that\r\n  case still representable by Fourier's Series.\r\n\r\n  _The Ultimate Values of the Coefficients in Fourier's Series._--If\r\n  [f](x) is everywhere finite within the given interval -[pi] to +[pi],\r\n  it can be shown that a_n, b_n, the coefficients of cos nx, sin nx in\r\n  the series which represent the function, are such that na_n, nb_n,\r\n  however great n is, are each less than a fixed finite quantity.

The representation of functions by these\r\n  series was first considered in the 18th century, in connexion with the\r\n  problem of a vibrating cord, and led to a controversy as to the\r\n  possibility of such expansions. In a memoir published in 1747\r\n  (_Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin_, vol. iii.) D'Alembert showed that\r\n  the ordinate y at any time t of a vibrating cord satisfies a\r\n  differential equation of the form [delta]^y/[delta]t^2 = a^2\r\n  [delta]^y/[delta]x^2, where x is measured along the undisturbed length\r\n  of the cord, and that with the ends of the cord of length l fixed, the\r\n  appropriate solution is y = [f](at + x) - [f](at - x), where [f] is a\r\n  function such that [f](x) = [f](x + 2l); in another memoir in the same\r\n  volume he seeks for functions which satisfy this condition. In the\r\n  year 1748 (_Berlin Memoirs_, vol. iv.) Euler, in discussing the\r\n  problem, gave [f](x) = [alpha] sin [pi]x/l + [beta] sin 2[pi]x/l + ...\r\n  as a particular solution, and maintained that every curve, whether\r\n  regular or irregular, must be representable in this form. This was\r\n  objected to by D'Alembert (1750) and also by Lagrange on the ground\r\n  that irregular curves are inadmissible. D. Bernoulli (_Berlin\r\n  Memoirs_, vol. ix., 1753) based a similar result to that of Euler on\r\n  physical intuition; his method was criticized by Euler (1753). The\r\n  question was then considered from a new point of view by Lagrange, in\r\n  a memoir on the nature and propagation of sound (_Miscellanea\r\n  Taurensia_, 1759; [_OE]uvres_, vol. i.), who, while criticizing\r\n  Euler's method, considers a finite number of vibrating particles, and\r\n  then makes the number of them infinite; he did not, however, quite\r\n  fully carry out the determination of the coefficients in Bernoulli's\r\n  Series. These mathematicians were hampered by the narrow conception of\r\n  a function, in which it is regarded as necessarily continuous; a\r\n  discontinuous function was considered only as a succession of several\r\n  different functions. Thus the possibility of the expansion of a broken\r\n  function was not generally admitted. The first cases in which rational\r\n  functions are expressed in sines and cosines were given by Euler\r\n  (_Subsidium calculi sinuum_, Novi Comm. Petrop., vol. v., 1754-1755),\r\n  who obtained the formulae\r\n\r\n    1/2 [phi] = sin [phi] - 1/2 sin 2[phi] + 1/3 sin 3[phi] ...\r\n\r\n    [pi]^2   [phi]^2\r\n    ------ - ------- = cos [phi] - 1/4 cos 2[phi] + 1/9 cos 3[phi] ...\r\n      12        4\r\n\r\n  In a memoir presented to the Academy of St Petersburg in 1777, but not\r\n  published until 1798, Euler gave the method afterwards used by\r\n  Fourier, of determining the coefficients in the expansions; he\r\n  remarked that if [Phi] is expansible in the form\r\n                                                         _                           _\r\n                                                   1    /[pi]                  2    /[pi]\r\n    A + B cos[phi] + C cos 2[phi] + ..., then A = ----  |    [Phi]d[phi], B = ----  |   cos [phi]d[phi], &c.\r\n                                                  [pi] _/ 0                   [pi] _/ 0\r\n\r\n  The second period in the development of the theory commenced in 1807,\r\n  when Fourier communicated his first memoir on the Theory of Heat to\r\n  the French Academy. His exposition of the present theory is contained\r\n  in a memoir sent to the Academy in 1811, of which his great treatise\r\n  the _Theorie analytique de la chaleur_, published in 1822, is, in the\r\n  main, a reproduction. Fourier set himself to consider the\r\n  representation of a function given graphically, and was the first\r\n  fully to grasp the idea that a single function may consist of detached\r\n  portions given arbitrarily by a graph. He had an accurate conception\r\n  of the convergence of a series, and although he did not give a\r\n  formally complete proof that a function with discontinuities is\r\n  representable by the series, he indicated in particular cases the\r\n  method of procedure afterwards carried out by Dirichlet. As an\r\n  exposition of principles, Fourier's work is still worthy of careful\r\n  perusal by all students of the subject. Poisson's treatment of the\r\n  subject, which has been adopted in English works (see the _Journal de\r\n  l'ecole polytechnique_, vol. xi., 1820, and vol. xii., 1823, and also\r\n  his treatise, _Theorie de la chaleur_, 1835), depends upon the equality\r\n      _\r\n     /[pi]                         1 - h^2\r\n     |    [f]([alpha]) ------------------------------ d[alpha]\r\n    _/-[pi]            1 - 2h cos (x - [alpha]) + h^2\r\n\r\n                _                                            _\r\n          1    /[pi]                          1             /[pi]\r\n      = -----  |    [f]([alpha]) d[alpha] + ---- [Sigma]h^n |     [f]([alpha]) cos n(x - [alpha]) d[alpha]\r\n        2[pi] _/-[pi]                       [pi]           _/-[pi]\r\n\r\n  where 0 < h < 1; the limit of the integral on the left-hand side is\r\n  evaluated when h=1, and found to be 1/2 {[f](x + 0) + [f](x - 0)}, the\r\n  series on the right-hand side becoming Fourier's Series. The equality\r\n  of the two limits is then inferred. If the series is assumed to be\r\n  convergent when h = 1, by a theorem of Abel's its sum is continuous\r\n  with the sum for values of h less than unity, but a proof of the\r\n  convergency for h = 1 is requisite for the validity of Poisson's\r\n  proof; as Poisson gave no such proof of convergency, his proof of the\r\n  general theorem cannot be accepted. The deficiency cannot be removed\r\n  except by a process of the same nature as that afterwards applied by\r\n  Dirichlet. The definite integral has been carefully studied by Schwarz\r\n  (see two memoirs in his collected works on the integration of the\r\n  equation [delta]^2u/[delta]x^2 + [delta]^2u/[delta]y^2 = 0), who showed\r\n  that the limiting value of the integral depends upon the manner in\r\n  which the limit is approached. Investigations of Fourier's Series were\r\n  also given by Cauchy (see his \"Memoire sur les developpements des\r\n  fonctions en series periodiques,\" _Mem. de l'Inst_., vol. vi., also\r\n  _Oeuvres completes_, vol. vii.); his method, which depends upon a use\r\n  of complex variables, was accepted, with some modification, as valid\r\n  by Riemann, but one at least of his proofs is no longer regarded as\r\n  satisfactory. The first completely satisfactory investigation is due\r\n  to Dirichlet; his first memoir appeared in _Crelle's Journal_ for\r\n  1829, and the second, which is a model of clearness, in Dove's\r\n  _Repertorium der Physik_. Dirichlet laid down certain definite\r\n  sufficient conditions in regard to the nature of a function which is\r\n  expansible, and found under these conditions the limiting value of the\r\n  sum of n terms of the series. Dirichlet's determination of the sum of\r\n  the series at a point of discontinuity has been criticized by Schlafli\r\n  (see _Crelle's Journal_, vol. lxxii.) and by Du Bois-Reymond (_Mathem.\r\n  Annalen_, vol. vii.), who maintained that the sum is really\r\n  indeterminate. Their objection appears, however, to rest upon a\r\n  misapprehension as to the meaning of the sum of the series; if x1 be\r\n  the point of discontinuity, it is possible to make x approach x1,\r\n  and n become indefinitely great, so that the sum of the series takes\r\n  any assigned value in a certain interval, whereas we ought to make x =\r\n  x1 first and afterwards n = [oo], and no other way of going to the\r\n  double limit is really admissible. Other papers by Dircksen (_Crelle_,\r\n  vol. iv.) and Bessel (_Astronomische Nachrichten_, vol. xvi.), on\r\n  similar lines to those by Dirichlet, are of inferior importance. Many\r\n  of the investigations subsequent to Dirichlet's have the object of\r\n  freeing a function from some of the restrictions which were imposed\r\n  upon it in Dirichlet's proof, but no complete set of necessary and\r\n  sufficient conditions as to the nature of the function has been\r\n  obtained. Lipschitz (\"De explicatione per series trigonometricas,\"\r\n  _Crelle's Journal_, vol. lxiii., 1864) showed that, under a certain\r\n  condition, a function which has an infinite number of maxima and\r\n  minima in the neighbourhood of a point is still expansible; his\r\n  condition is that at the point of discontinuity [beta], |[f]([beta] +\r\n  [delta]) -f([beta])| < B[delta]^[alpha] as [delta] converges to zero,\r\n  B being a constant, and a a positive exponent. A somewhat wider\r\n  condition is\r\n\r\n    {[f]([beta] + [delta]) - [f]([beta])} log [delta]) = 0,\r\n                                      [delta] = 0\r\n\r\n  for which Lipschitz's results would hold. This last condition is\r\n  adopted by Dini in his treatise (_Sopra la serie di Fourier_, &c.,\r\n  Pisa, 1880).\r\n\r\n  The modern period in the theory was inaugurated by the publication by\r\n  Riemann in 1867 of his very important memoir, written in 1854, _Uber\r\n  die Darstellbarkeit einer Function durch eine trigonometrische Reihe_.\r\n  The first part of his memoir contains a historical account of the work\r\n  of previous investigators; in the second part there is a discussion of\r\n  the foundations of the Integral Calculus, and the third part is mainly\r\n  devoted to a discussion of what can be inferred as to the nature of a\r\n  function respecting the changes in its value for a continuous change\r\n  in the variable, if the function is capable of representation by a\r\n  trigonometrical series. Dirichlet and probably Riemann thought that\r\n  all continuous functions were everywhere representable by the series;\r\n  this view was refuted by Du Bois-Reymond (_Abh. der Bayer. Akad._ vol.\r\n  xii. 2). It was shown by Riemann that the convergence or\r\n  non-convergence of the series at a particular point x depends only\r\n  upon the nature of the function in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood\r\n  of the point x. The first to call attention to the importance of the\r\n  theory of uniform convergence of series in connexion with Fourier's\r\n  Series was Stokes, in his memoir \"On the Critical Values of the Sums\r\n  of Periodic Series\" (_Camb. Phil. Trans._, 1847; _Collected Papers_,\r\n  vol. i.). As the method of determining the coefficients in a\r\n  trigonometrical series is invalid unless the series converges in\r\n  general uniformly, the question arose whether series with coefficients\r\n  other than those of Fourier exist which represent arbitrary functions.\r\n  Heine showed (_Crelle's Journal_, vol. lxxi., 1870, and in his\r\n  treatise _Kugelfunctionen_, vol. i.) that Fourier's Series is in\r\n  general uniformly convergent, and that if there is a uniformly\r\n  convergent series which represents a function, it is the only one of\r\n  the kind. G. Cantor then showed (_Crelle's Journal_, vols. lxxii.\r\n  lxxiii.) that even if uniform convergence be not demanded, there can\r\n  be but one convergent expansion for a function, and that it is that of\r\n  Fourier. In the _Math. Ann._ vol. v., Cantor extended his\r\n  investigation to functions having an infinite number of\r\n  discontinuities. Important contributions to the theory of the series\r\n  have been published by Du Bois-Reymond (_Abh. der Bayer. Akademie_,\r\n  vol. xii., 1875, two memoirs, also in Crelle's Journal, vols. lxxiv.\r\n  lxxvi. lxxix.), by Kronecker (_Berliner Berichte_, 1885), by O. Holder\r\n  (_Berliner Berichte_, 1885), by Jordan (_Comptes rendus_, 1881, vol.\r\n  xcii.), by Ascoli (_Math. Annal._, 1873, and _Annali di matematica_,\r\n  vol. vi.), and by Genocchi (_Atti della R. Acc. di Torino_, vol. x.,\r\n  1875). Hamilton's memoir on \"Fluctuating Functions\" (_Trans. R.I.A._,\r\n  vol. xix., 1842) may also be studied with profit in this connexion. A\r\n  memoir by Broden (_Math. Annalen_, vol. lii.) contains a good\r\n  investigation of some of the most recent results on the subject. The\r\n  scope of Fourier's Series has been extended by Lebesgue, who\r\n  introduced a conception of integration wider than that due to Riemann.\r\n  Lebesgue's work on Fourier's Series will be found in his treatise,\r\n  _Lecons sur les series trigonometriques_ (1906); also in a memoir,\r\n  \"Sur les series trigonometriques,\" _Annales sc. de l'ecole normale\r\n  superieure_, series ii. vol. xx. (1903), and in a paper \"Sur la\r\n  convergence des series de Fourier,\" _Math. Annalen_, vol. lxiv.\r\n  (1905).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The foregoing historical account has been mainly drawn\r\n  from A. Sachse's work, \"Versuch einer Geschichte der Darstellung\r\n  willkurlicher Functionen einer Variabeln durch trigonometrische\r\n  Reihen,\" published in _Schlomilch's Zeitschrift fur Mathematik_,\r\n  Supp., vol. xxv. 1880, and from a paper by G.A.

It is one of the chief centres in France for wool combing and\r\nspinning, and produces a great variety of cloths. The glass-works of\r\nFourmies date from 1599, and were the first established in the north of\r\nFrance. Iron is worked in the vicinity, and there are important forges\r\nand foundries. Enamel-ware is also manufactured. In 1891 labour troubles\r\nbrought about military intervention and consequent bloodshed. A board of\r\ntrade arbitration and a school of commerce and industry are among the\r\npublic institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURMONT, ETIENNE (1683-1745), French orientalist, was born at Herbelai,\r\nnear Saint Denis, on the 23rd of June 1683. He studied at the College\r\nMazarin, Paris, and afterwards in the College Montaigu, where his\r\nattention was attracted to Oriental languages. Shortly after leaving the\r\ncollege he published a _Traduction du commentaire du Rabbin Abraham Aben\r\nEsra sur l'ecclesiast_e. In 1711 Louis XIV. appointed Fourmont to assist\r\na young Chinese, Hoan-ji, in compiling a Chinese grammar. Hoan-ji died\r\nin 1716, and it was not until 1737 that Fourmont published _Meditationes\r\nSinicae_ and in 1742 _Grammatica Sinica_. He also wrote _Reflexions\r\ncritiques sur les histoires des anciens peuples_ (1735), and several\r\ndissertations printed in the _Memoires_ of the Academy of Inscriptions.\r\nHe became professor of Arabic in the College de France in 1715. In 1713\r\nhe was elected a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, in 1738 a member\r\nof the Royal Society of London, and in 1742 a member of that of Berlin.\r\nHe died at Paris on the 19th of December 1745.\r\n\r\nHis brother, Michel Fourmont (1690-1746), was also a member of the\r\nAcademy of Inscriptions, and professor of the Syriac language in the\r\nRoyal College, and was sent by the government to copy inscriptions in\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n  An account of Etienne Fourmont's life and a catalogue of his works\r\n  will be found in the second edition (1747) of his _Reflexions\r\n  critiques_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURNET, JOSEPH JEAN BAPTISTE XAVIER (1801-1869), French geologist and\r\nmetallurgist, was born at Strassburg on the 15th of May 1801. He was\r\neducated at the Ecole des Mines at Paris, and after considerable\r\nexperience as a mining engineer he was in 1834 appointed professor of\r\ngeology at Lyons. He was a man of wide knowledge and extensive research,\r\nand wrote memoirs on chemical and mineralogical subjects, on eruptive\r\nrocks, on the structure of the Jura, the metamorphism of the Western\r\nAlps, on the formation of oolitic limestones, on kaolinization and on\r\nmetalliferous veins. On metallurgical subjects also he was an\r\nacknowledged authority; and he published observations on the order of\r\nsulphurability of metals (_loi de Fournet_). He died at Lyons on the 8th\r\nof January 1869. His chief publications were: E_tudes sur les depots\r\nmetalliferes_ (Paris, 1834); _Histoire de la dolomie_ (Lyons, 1847); _De\r\nl'extension des terrains houillers_ (1855); _Geologie lyonnaise_ (Lyons,\r\n1861).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURNIER, PIERRE SIMON (1712-1768), French engraver and typefounder, was\r\nborn at Paris on the 15th of September 1712. He was the son of a\r\nprinter, and was brought up to his father's business. After studying\r\ndrawing under the painter Colson, he practised for some time the art of\r\nwood-engraving, and ultimately turned his attention to the engraving and\r\ncasting of types. He designed many new characters, and his foundry\r\nbecame celebrated not only in France, but in foreign countries. Not\r\ncontent with his practical achievements, he sought to stimulate public\r\ninterest in his art by the production of various works on the subject.\r\nIn 1737 he published his _Table des proportions qu'il faut observer\r\nentre les caracteres_, which was followed by several other technical\r\ntreatises. In 1758 he assailed the title of Gutenberg to the honour\r\nawarded him as inventor of printing, claiming it for Schoffer, in his\r\n_Dissertation sur l'origine et les progres de l'art de graver en bois_.\r\nThis gave rise to a controversy in which Schopflin and Baer were his\r\nopponents. Fournier's contributions to this debate were collected and\r\nreprinted under the title of _Traites historiques et critiques sur\r\nl'origine de l'imprimerie_. His principal work, however, was the _Manuel\r\ntypographique_, which appeared in 2 vols. 8vo in 1764, the first volume\r\ntreating of engraving and type-founding, the second of printing, with\r\nexamples of different alphabets. It was the author's design to complete\r\nthe work in four volumes, but he did not live to execute it. He died at\r\nParis on the 8th of October 1768.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURNIER L'HERITIER, CLAUDE (1745-1825), French revolutionist, called\r\n\"l'Americain,\" was born at Auzon (Haute-Loire) on the 21st of December\r\n1745, the son of a poor weaver. He went to America to seek his fortune,\r\nand started at San Domingo an establishment for making _tafia_ (an\r\ninferior quality of rum), but lost his money in a fire. Returning to\r\nFrance he threw himself into the Revolution with enthusiasm, and\r\nspecially distinguished himself by the active part he took in the\r\norganization of the popular armed force by means of which the most\r\nfamous of the revolutionary _coups_ were effected. His influence was\r\nprincipally manifested in the insurrections of the 5th and 6th of\r\nOctober 1789, the 17th of July 1791, and the 20th of June and the 10th\r\nof August 1792. He was on bad terms with the majority of the\r\npoliticians, and particularly with Marat, and spent a great part of his\r\ntime in prison, all the governments regarding him as an agitator and\r\naccusing him of inciting to insurrection. Arrested for the first time\r\nfor trying to force an entrance into the club of the Cordeliers, from\r\nwhich he had been expelled, he was released, but was in prison from the\r\n12th of December 1793 to the 21st of September 1794, and again from the\r\n9th of March 1795 to the 26th of October 1795. After the attempt on the\r\nFirst Consul in the rue Sainte-Nicaise he was deported to Guiana, but\r\nwas allowed to return to France in 1809. In 1811, while under\r\nsurveillance at Auxerre, he was accused of having provoked an _emeute_\r\nagainst taxes known as the _droits reunis_ (afterwards called\r\nc_ontributions indirectes_), and was imprisoned in the Chateau d'If,\r\nwhere he remained till 1814. On the second restoration of the Bourbons\r\nFournier was confined for about nine months in the prison of La Force.\r\nAfter 1816 he was left unmolested, turned royalist, and passed his last\r\nyears in importuning the Restoration government for compensation for his\r\nlost property in San Domingo. He died in obscurity.\r\n\r\n  For further details see preface to F.A. Aulard's edition of Fournier's\r\n  _Memoires secrets_ (Paris, 1890), published by the Societe de\r\n  l'histoire de la Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTOU, MARIE FRANCOIS OSCAR BARDY DE (1836-1897), French politician,\r\nwas born at Riberac (Dordogne) on the 3rd of January 1836, and\r\nrepresented his native department in the National Assembly after the\r\nFranco-German War. There he proved a useful adherent to Thiers, who made\r\nhim minister of public works in December 1872. He was minister of\r\nreligion in the cabinet of May 18-24, 1873, being the only member of the\r\nRight included by Thiers in that short-lived ministry. As minister of\r\neducation, religion and the fine arts in the reconstructed cabinet of\r\nthe duc de Broglie he had used his administrative powers to further\r\nclerical ends, and as minister of the interior in Broglie's cabinet in\r\n1877 he resumed the administrative methods of the Second Empire. With a\r\nwell-known Bonapartist, Baron R.C.F. Reille, as his secretary, he\r\nreplaced republican functionaries by Bonapartist partisans, reserving a\r\nfew places for the Legitimists. In the general elections of that year he\r\nused the whole weight of officialdom to secure a majority for the Right,\r\nto support a clerical and reactionary programme. He accompanied Marshal\r\nMacMahon in his tour through southern France, and the presidential\r\nmanifesto of September, stating that the president would rely solely on\r\nthe Senate should the elections prove unfavourable, was generally\r\nattributed to Fourtou. In spite of these efforts the cabinet fell, and a\r\ncommission was appointed to inquire into their unconstitutional abuse of\r\npower. Fourtou was unseated in consequence of the revelations made in\r\nthe report of the commission. In the Chamber of Deputies Gambetta gave\r\nthe lie direct to Fourtou's allegation that the republican party opposed\r\nevery republican principle that was not antiquated. A duel was fought in\r\nconsequence, but neither party was injured. He was re-elected to the\r\nchamber in 1879 and entered the Senate the next year. Failing to secure\r\nre-election to the Senate in 1885 he again entered the popular chamber\r\nas Legitimist candidate in 1889, but he took no further active part in\r\npolitics. He died in Paris in 1897.\r\n\r\n  His works include _Histoire de Louis XVI_ (1840); _Histoire de Saint\r\n  Pie V_ (1845); _Mme Swetchine, sa vie et ses oeuvres_ (2 vols., 1859);\r\n  _La Question italienne_ (1860); _De la contre-revolution_ (1876); and\r\n  _Memoires d'un royaliste_ (2 vols., 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUSSA, or FOSSA, the native name of _Cryptoprocta ferox_, a somewhat\r\ncat-like or civet-like mammal peculiar to Madagascar, where it is the\r\nlargest carnivorous animal. It is about twice the size of a cat (5 ft.\r\nfrom nose to end of tail), with short close fur of nearly uniform pale\r\nbrown. Little is known of its habits, except that it is nocturnal,\r\nfrequently attacks and carries off goats, and especially kids, and shows\r\ngreat ferocity when wounded, on which account it is much dreaded by the\r\nnatives. An example lived in the London zoological gardens for nearly\r\nfourteen years. See CARNIVORA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWEY (usually pronounced _Foy_), a seaport and market-town in the\r\nBodmin parliamentary division of Cornwall, England, on the Great Western\r\nrailway, 25 m. by sea W. of Plymouth. Pop. (1901) 2258. It lies on the\r\nwest shore of the picturesque estuary of the river Fowey, close to the\r\nwater's edge, and sheltered by a screen of hills. Its church of St\r\nNicholas is said to have been built in the 14th century, on the site of\r\na still older edifice dedicated to St Finbar of Cork. It has a fine\r\ntower and late Norman doorway. Within are a priest's chamber over the\r\nporch, a handsome oak ceiling, a 15th-century pulpit, and some curious\r\nmonuments and brasses. Place House, adjacent to the church, is a highly\r\nornate Tudor building. A few ancient houses remain in the town. Deep-sea\r\nfishing is carried on; but the staple trade consists in the export of\r\nchina clay and minerals, coal being imported. Fowey harbour, which is\r\neasy of access in clear weather, will admit large vessels at any state\r\nof the tide. St Catherine's Fort, dating from the days of Henry VIII.\r\nand now ruined, stands at the harbour's mouth, and once formed the main\r\ndefence of the town. Opposite the town, and connected with it by\r\nBodeneck Ferry, is the village of Polruan. Its main features are St\r\nSaviour's Chapel, with an ancient rood-stone, and the remains of Hall\r\nHouse, which was garrisoned during the civil wars of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nFowey (Fawy, Vawy, Fowyk) held a leading position amongst Cornish ports\r\nfrom the reign of Edward I. to the days of the Tudors. The numerous\r\nreferences to the privateering exploits of its ships in the Patent and\r\nClose Rolls and the extraordinary number of them at the siege of Calais\r\nin 1346 alike testify to its importance. During this period the king's\r\nmandates were addressed to the bailiffs or to the mayor and bailiffs,\r\nand no charter of incorporation appears to have been granted until the\r\nreign of James II. Under the second charter of 1690 the common council\r\nconsisted of a mayor and eight aldermen and these with a recorder\r\nelected the free burgesses. A member for Fowey and Looe was summoned to\r\na council at Westminster in 1340, but from that date until 1571, when it\r\nwas entrusted with the privilege of returning two members, it had no\r\nparliamentary representation. By the Reform Act of 1832 it lost both its\r\nmembers. It had ceased to exercise its municipal functions a few years\r\npreviously. In 1316 the prior of Tywardreath, as lord of the manor,\r\nobtained the right to hold a Monday market and two fairs on the feasts\r\nof St Finbar and St Lucy, but by the charter of 1690 provision was made\r\nfor a Saturday market and three fairs, on the 1st of May, 10th of\r\nSeptember and Shrove Tuesday, and only these three continue to be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWL (Dan. _Fugl_, Ger. _Vogel_), a term originally used in the sense\r\nthat bird[1] now is, but, except in composition,--as sea-fowl, wild-fowl\r\nand the like,--practically almost confined[2] at present to designate\r\nthe otherwise nameless species which struts on our dunghills, gathers\r\nround our barn-doors, or stocks our poultry yards--the type of the genus\r\n_Gallus_ of ornithologists, of which four well-marked species are known.\r\nThe _first_ of these is the red jungle-fowl of the greater part of\r\nIndia, _G. ferrugineus_,--called by many writers _G. bankiva_,--which is\r\nundoubtedly the parent stock of all the domestic races (cf. Darwin,\r\n_Animals and Plants under Domestication_, i. pp. 233-246). It inhabits\r\nnorthern India from Sind to Burma and Cochin China, as well as the Malay\r\nPeninsula and many of the islands as far as Timor, besides the\r\nPhilippines. It occurs on the Himalayas up to the height of 4000 ft.,\r\nand its southern limits in the west of India proper are, according to\r\nJerdon, found on the Raj-peepla hills to the south of the Nerbudda, and\r\nin the east near the left bank of the Godavery, or perhaps even farther,\r\nas he had heard of its being killed at Cummum. This species resembles in\r\nplumage what is commonly known among poultry-fanciers as the\r\n\"Black-breasted game\" breed, and this is said to be especially the case\r\nwith examples from the Malay countries, between which and examples from\r\nIndia some differences are observable--the latter having the plumage\r\nless red, the ear-lappets almost invariably white, and slate-coloured\r\nlegs, while in the former the ear-lappets are crimson, like the comb and\r\nwattles, and the legs yellowish. If the Malayan birds be considered\r\ndistinct, it is to them that the name _G. bankiva_ properly applies.\r\nThis species is said to be found in lofty forests and in dense thickets,\r\nas well as in ordinary bamboo-jungles, and when cultivated land is near\r\nits haunts, it may be seen in the fields after the crops are cut in\r\nstraggling parties of from 10 to 20. The crow to which the cock gives\r\nutterance morning and evening is just like that of a bantam, never\r\nprolonged as in most domestic birds. The hen breeds from January to\r\nJuly, according to the locality; and lays from 8 to 12 creamy-white\r\neggs, occasionally scraping together a few leaves or a little dry grass\r\nby way of a nest. The so-called _G. giganteus_, formerly taken by some\r\nornithologists for a distinct species, is now regarded as a tame breed\r\nof _G. ferrugineus_ or _bankiva_. The _second_ good species is the grey\r\njungle-fowl, _G. sonnerati_, whose range begins a little to the\r\nnorthward of the limits of the preceding, and it occupies the southern\r\npart of the Indian peninsula, without being found elsewhere. The cock\r\nhas the end of the shaft of the neck-hackles dilated, forming a horny\r\nplate, like a drop of yellow sealing-wax. His call is very peculiar,\r\nbeing a broken and imperfect kind of crow, quite unlike that of _G.\r\nferrugineus_ and more like a cackle. The two species where their\r\nrespective ranges overlap, occasionally interbreed in a wild state, and\r\nthe present readily crosses in confinement with domestic poultry, but\r\nthe hybrids are nearly always sterile. The _third_ species is the\r\nSinhalese jungle-fowl, _G. stanleyi_ (the _G. lafayettii_ of some\r\nauthors), peculiar to Ceylon. This also greatly resembles in plumage\r\nsome domestic birds, but the cock is red beneath, and has a yellow comb\r\nwith a red edge and purplish-red cheeks and wattles. He has also a\r\nsingularly different voice, his crow being dissyllabic. This bird\r\ncrosses readily with tame hens, but the hybrids are believed to be\r\ninfertile. The _fourth_ species, _G. varius_ (the _G. furcatus_ of some\r\nauthors), inhabits Java and the islands eastwards as far as Flores. This\r\ndiffers remarkably from the others in not possessing hackles, and in\r\nhaving a large unserrated comb of red and blue and only a single chin\r\nwattle. The predominance of green in its plumage is another easy mark of\r\ndistinction. Hybrids between this species and domestic birds are often\r\nproduced, but they are most commonly sterile. Some of them have been\r\nmistaken for distinct species, as those which have received the names of\r\n_G. aeneus_ and _G. temmincki_.\r\n\r\nSeveral circumstances seem to render it likely that fowls were first\r\ndomesticated in Burma or the countries adjacent thereto, and it is the\r\ntradition of the Chinese that they received their poultry from the West\r\nabout the year 1400 B.C. By the Institutes of Manu, the tame fowl is\r\nforbidden, though the wild is allowed to be eaten--showing that its\r\ndomestication was accomplished when they were written. The bird is not\r\nmentioned in the Old Testament nor by Homer, though he has [Greek:\r\n'Alektor] (cock) as the name of a man, nor is it figured on ancient\r\nEgyptian monuments. Pindar mentions it, and Aristophanes calls it the\r\nPersian bird, thus indicating it to have been introduced to Greece\r\nthrough Persia, and it is figured on Babylonian cylinders between the\r\n6th and 7th centuries B.C. It is sculptured on the Lycian marbles in the\r\nBritish Museum (c. 600 B.C.), and E. Blyth remarks (Ibis, 1867, p. 157)\r\nthat it is there represented with the appearance of a true jungle-fowl,\r\nfor none of the wild _Galli_ have the upright bearing of the tame breed,\r\nbut carry their tail in a drooping position. For further particulars of\r\nthese breeds see POULTRY.     (A.

After serving an apprenticeship of five\r\nyears at Exeter, he went to London in 1814, and entered the office of\r\nDavid Laing, where he remained till he commenced practice for himself.\r\nHis first work of importance was the court of bankruptcy in Basinghall\r\nStreet, finished in 1821. In the following year he gained the first\r\npremium for a design for the new London bridge, which, however, was\r\nultimately built according to the design of another architect. Fowler's\r\nother designs for bridges include one constructed across the Dart at\r\nTotnes. He was also the architect for the markets of Covent Garden and\r\nHungerford, the new market at Gravesend, and Exeter lower market, and\r\nbesides several churches he designed Devon lunatic asylum (1845), the\r\nLondon fever hospital (1849), and the hall of the Wax Chandlers'\r\nCompany, Gresham Street (1853). For some years he was honorary secretary\r\nof the institute of British architects, and he was afterwards created\r\nvice-president. He retired from his profession in 1853, and died at\r\nGreat Marlow, Bucks, on the 26th of September 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWLER, EDWARD (1632-1714), English divine, was born in 1632 at\r\nWesterleigh, Gloucestershire, and was educated at Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, Oxford, afterwards migrating to Trinity College, Cambridge. He\r\nwas successively rector of Norhill, Bedfordshire (1656) and of All\r\nHallows, Bread Street, London (1673), and in 1676 was elected a canon of\r\nGloucester, his friend Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, resigning in\r\nhis favour. In 1681 he became vicar of St Giles, Cripplegate, but after\r\nfour years was suspended for Whiggism. When the Declaration of\r\nIndulgence was published in 1687 he successfully influenced the London\r\nclergy against reading it. In 1691 he was consecrated bishop of\r\nGloucester and held the see until his death on the 26th of August 1714.\r\nFowler was suspected of Pelagian tendencies, and his earliest book was a\r\n_Free Discourse_ in defence of _The Practices of Certain Moderate\r\nDivines called Latitudinarians_ (1670). _The Design of Christianity_,\r\npublished by him in the following year, in which he laid stress on the\r\nmoral design of revelation, was criticized by Baxter in his _How far\r\nHoliness is the Design of Christianity_ (1671) and by Bunyan in his\r\n_Defence of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith_ (1672), the latter\r\ndescribing the _Design_ as \"a mixture of Popery, Socinianism and\r\nQuakerism,\" a horrid accusation to which Fowler replied in a scurrilous\r\npamphlet entitled _Dirt Wip'd Off_. He also published, in 1693,\r\n_Twenty-Eight Propositions, by which the Doctrine of the Trinity is\r\nendeavoured to be explained_, challenging with some success the Socinian\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWLER, JOHN (1826-1864), English inventor, was born at Melksham, Wilts,\r\non the 11th of July 1826. He learned practical engineering at\r\nMiddlesborough-on-Tees, and about 1850 invented a mechanical system for\r\nthe drainage of land. In 1852 he began experiments in steam cultivation,\r\nand in 1858 the Royal Agricultural Society awarded him the prize of L500\r\nwhich it had offered for a steam-cultivator that should be an economic\r\nsubstitute for the plough or the spade. In 1860 he founded at Hunslet,\r\nLeeds, the firm of Fowler & Co., manufacturers of agricultural\r\nmachinery, traction engines, &c. He died at Ackworth, Yorkshire, on the\r\n4th of December 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWLER, SIR JOHN (1817-1898), English civil engineer, was born on the\r\n15th of July 1817 at Wadsley Hall, near Sheffield, where his father was\r\na land-surveyor. At the age of sixteen he became a pupil of John\r\nTowlerton Leather, the engineer of the Sheffield water-works. The\r\nlatter's uncle, George Leather, was engineer of the Great Aire and\r\nCalder Navigation Company, of the Goole Docks, and other similar works,\r\nand Fowler passed occasionally into his employment, in which he acquired\r\na thorough knowledge of hydraulic engineering. The era of railway\r\nconstruction soon swept both Fowler and his employers into its service,\r\nand one of his first employments was to oppose the route of the Midland\r\nrailway, chosen by the Stephensons, which left Sheffield on a branch\r\nline, and was therefore strongly resented by the inhabitants. The\r\nprestige of the Stephensons carried all before it, but in later life Sir\r\nJohn Fowler had the satisfaction of seeing the opposition of his clients\r\njustified, and Sheffield placed on the main line. In 1838 he went into\r\nthe office of John Urpeth Rastrick, one of the leading railway engineers\r\nof the day, where he was employed in designing bridges for the line from\r\nLondon to Brighton, and also in surveying for railways in Lancashire. In\r\n1839 he went as representative of Mr Leather to take charge of the\r\nconstruction of the Stockton & Hartlepool railway and remained as\r\nmanager of the line after it was finished. In 1844 he began his\r\nindependent career as an engineer, and from the first was largely\r\nemployed, more particularly in laying out the small railway systems\r\nwhich eventually were amalgamated under the title of the Manchester,\r\nSheffield & Lincolnshire. In the course of this work he designed a\r\nbridge known as Torksey Bridge, which was disallowed by the Board of\r\nTrade inspector, Captain (afterwards Field-Marshal Sir) Lintorn Simmons.\r\nThe engineering profession espoused Fowler's side in the controversy\r\nwhich followed, and as a result the verdict of the Board of Trade was\r\nmodified. The episode was the beginning of a warm friendship between\r\nthese distinguished representatives of civil and military engineering.\r\nFowler was engineer of the London Metropolitan railway, the pioneer of\r\nunderground railways, and noteworthy in that it was mostly made not by\r\ntunnelling, but by excavating from the surface and then covering in the\r\npermanent way; and he lived to be one of the engineers officially\r\nconnected with the deep tunnelling \"tube\" system extensively adopted for\r\nelectric railways in London. He was also engaged in the making of\r\nrailways in Ireland, and in 1867 he was selected by Disraeli to serve on\r\na commission to advise the government in respect of a proposal for a\r\nstate-purchase of the Irish railway system. He also carried out\r\nconsiderable works in relation to the Nene Valley drainage and the\r\nreclamation of land at the Norfolk estuary.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 he was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers,\r\nthe youngest president who had ever sat in the chair. He was strongly\r\nopposed to the project of a Channel tunnel to France, and in 1872 he\r\nendeavoured to obtain the consent of parliament to a Channel ferry\r\nscheme, whereby trains were to be transported across the strait in large\r\nferry steamers. The proposal involved the making of enlarged harbours at\r\nDover and Audresselles on the French coast, and the bill, after passing\r\nthe Commons, was thrown out by the casting vote of the chairman of a\r\ncommittee of the House of Lords. In 1875 he was enabled to render, in\r\nhis private capacity, a signal service to the Italian government, which\r\nwas much embarrassed by impracticable proposals pressed on it by\r\nGaribaldi for a rectification of the course of the Tiber and other\r\nengineering works. He had several interviews with the Italian patriot,\r\nand persuaded him of the impracticable nature of his plan, thereby\r\nobtaining for the government leisure to devise a more reasonable scheme.\r\nFor eight years from 1871 he acted as general engineering adviser in\r\nEgypt to the Khedive Ismail. He projected a railway to the Sudan, and\r\nalso the reparation of the barrage. These and many other plans came to\r\nan end owing to financial reasons. But the maps and surveys for the\r\nrailway were given to the war office, and proved most useful to Lord\r\nWolseley in his Nile expedition. For his service Fowler was made\r\nK.C.M.G. (1885). He was created a baronet in 1890 on the completion of\r\nthe Forth bridge, of which with his partner Sir Benjamin Baker he was\r\njoint engineer. He died at Bournemouth on the 20th of November 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWLER, WILLIAM (c. 1560-1614), Scottish poet, was born about the year\r\n1560. He attended St Leonard's college, St Andrews, between 1574 and\r\n1578, and in 1581 he was in Paris studying civil law. In 1581 he issued\r\na pamphlet against John Hamilton and other Catholics, who had, he said,\r\ndriven him from his country. He subsequently (about ?1590) became\r\nprivate secretary and Master of Requests to Anne of Denmark, wife of\r\nJames VI., and was renominated to these offices when the queen went to\r\nEngland. In 1609 his services were rewarded by a grant of 2000 acres in\r\nUlster. His sister Susannah Fowler married Sir John Drummond, and was\r\nmother of the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden. On the title-page of\r\n_The Triumphs of Petrarke_, Fowler styles himself \"P. of Hawick,\" which\r\nhas been held to mean that he was parson of Hawick, but this is\r\ndoubtful. A MS. collection of seventy-two sonnets, entitled _The\r\nTarantula of Love_, and a translation (1587) from the Italian of the\r\n_Triumphs of Petrarke_ are preserved in the library of the university of\r\nEdinburgh, in the collection bequeathed by his nephew, William Drummond.\r\nTwo other volumes of his manuscript notes, scrolls of poems, &c., are\r\npreserved among the Drummond MSS., now in the library of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries of Scotland. Specimens of Fowler's verses were published in\r\n1803 by John Leyden in his _Scottish Descriptive Poems_. Fowler\r\ncontributed a prefatory sonnet to James VI.'s _Furies_; and James, in\r\nreturn, commended, in verse, Fowler's _Triumphs_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX, CHARLES JAMES (1749-1806), British statesman and orator, was the\r\nthird son of Henry Fox, 1st Lord Holland, and his wife. Lady Caroline\r\nLennox, eldest daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd duke of Richmond. He was\r\nborn at 9 Conduit Street, Westminster, on the 24th of January 1749. The\r\nfather, who treated his children with extreme indulgence, allowed him to\r\nchoose his school, and he elected to go to one kept at Wandsworth by a\r\nFrench refugee, named Pampelonne. In a very short time he asked to be\r\nsent to Eton, where he went in 1757. At Eton he did no more work than\r\nwas acceptable to him, but he had an inborn love of literature, and he\r\nlaid the foundation of that knowledge of the classic languages which in\r\nafter years was the delight of his life. The vehemence of his temper was\r\ncontrolled by an affectionate disposition. When quite a boy he checked\r\nhis own tendency to fits of passion on learning that his father trusted\r\nhim to cure his defects.\r\n\r\nThat he learnt anything, and that he grew up an amiable and magnanimous\r\nman, were solely due to his natural worth, for no one ever owed less to\r\neducation or to family example. The relations of Lord Holland to his\r\nsons would be difficult to parallel. He not only treated them, and in\r\nparticular Charles, as friends and companions in pleasure from the\r\nfirst, but he did his best to encourage them in dissipation. In 1763 he\r\ntook Charles for a tour on the continent, introduced him to the most\r\nimmoral society of the time and gave him money with which to gamble. The\r\nboy came back to Eton a precocious rake. It was his good fortune that he\r\ndid go back, for he was subjected to a wholesome course of ridicule by\r\nthe other boys, and was flogged by Dr Barnard, the headmaster. In 1764\r\nCharles proceeded to Hertford College, Oxford. At Oxford, as at Eton, he\r\nread literature from natural liking, and he paid some attention to\r\nmathematics. His often quoted saying that he found mathematics\r\nentertaining was probably meant as a jest at the expense of Sir G.\r\nMacartney, to whom he was writing, and who was known to maintain that it\r\nwas useless. His own account of his school and college training, given\r\nin a letter to the same correspondent (6th August 1767), is: \"I employed\r\nalmost my whole time at Oxford in the mathematical and classical\r\nknowledge, but more particularly in the latter, so that I understand\r\nLatin and Greek tolerably well. I am totally ignorant in every part of\r\nuseful knowledge. I am more convinced every day how little advantage\r\nthere is in being what at school and the university is called a good\r\nscholar: one receives a good deal of amusement from it, but that is all.\r\nAt present I read nothing but Italian, which I am immoderately fond of,\r\nparticularly of the poetry.... As for French, I am far from being so\r\nthorough a master of it as I could wish, but I know so much of it that I\r\ncould perfect myself in it at any time with very little trouble,\r\nespecially if I pass three or four months in France.\" The passage is\r\ncharacteristic. It shows at once his love of good literature and his\r\nthoroughness. Fox's youth was disorderly, but it was never indolent. He\r\nwas incapable of half doing anything which he did at all. He did perfect\r\nhimself in French, and he showed no less determination to master mere\r\nsports. At a later period when he had grown fat he accounted for his\r\nskill in taking \"cut balls\" at tennis by saying that he was a very\r\n\"painstaking man.\" He was all his life a great and steady walker.\r\n\r\nThe disorders of his early years were notorious, and were a common\r\nsubject of gossip. In the spring of 1767 he left Oxford and joined his\r\nfather on the continent during a tour in France and Italy. In 1768 Lord\r\nHolland bought the pocket borough of Midhurst for him, and he entered on\r\nhis parliamentary career, and on London society, in 1769. Within the\r\nnext few years Lord Holland reaped to the full the reward for all that\r\nwas good, and whatever was evil, in the training he had given his son.\r\nThe affection of Charles Fox for his father was unbounded, but the\r\npassion for gambling which had been instilled in him as a boy proved the\r\nruin of the family fortune. He kept racehorses, and bet on them largely.\r\nOn the racecourse he was successful, and it is another proof of his\r\nnative thoroughness that he gained a reputation as a handicapper. It is\r\nsaid that he won more than he lost on the course. At the gambling table\r\nhe was unfortunate, and there can be little question that he was fleeced\r\nboth in London and in Paris by unscrupulous players of his own social\r\nrank, who took advantage of his generosity and whose worthlessness he\r\nknew. In the ardour of his passion Fox took his losses and their\r\nconsequences with an attractive gaiety. He called the room in which he\r\ndid business with the Jew moneylenders his \"Jerusalem chamber.\" When his\r\nelder brother had a son, and his prospects were injured, he said that\r\nthe boy was a second Messiah, who had appeared for the destruction of\r\nthe Jews. \"He had his jest, and they had his estate.\" In 1774 Lord\r\nHolland had to find L140,000 to pay the gambling debts of his sons. For\r\nyears Charles lived in pecuniary embarrassment, and during his later\r\nyears, when he had given up gambling, he was supported by the\r\ncontributions of wealthy friends, who in 1793 formed a fund of L70,000\r\nfor his benefit.\r\n\r\nHis public career did not supply him with a check on habits of\r\ndissipation in the shape of the responsibilities of office. He began, as\r\nwas to be expected in his father's son, by supporting the court; and in\r\n1770, when only twenty-one, he was appointed a junior lord of the\r\nadmiralty with Lord North. During the violent conflict over the\r\nMiddlesex election (see WILKES, JOHN) he took the unpopular side, and\r\nvehemently asserted the right of the House of Commons to exclude Wilkes.\r\nIn 1772 during the proceedings against Crosby and Oliver--a part of the\r\n\"Wilkes and liberty\" agitation--he and Lord North were attacked by a mob\r\nand rolled in the mud. But Fox's character was incompatible with\r\nministerial service under King George III. The king, himself a man of\r\norderly life, detested him as a gambler and a rake. And Fox was too\r\nindependent to please a master who expected obedience. In February 1772\r\nhe threw up his place to be free to oppose the Royal Marriage Act, on\r\nwhich the king's heart was set. He returned to office as junior lord of\r\nthe treasury in December. But he was insubordinate; his sympathy with\r\nthe American colonies, which were now beginning to resist the claims of\r\nthe mother country to tax them, made him intolerable to the king and he\r\nwas dismissed in February 1774. The death of his father on the 1st of\r\nJuly of that year removed an influence which tended to keep him\r\nsubordinate to the court, and his friendship for Burke drew him into\r\nclose alliance with the Rockingham Whigs. From the first his ability had\r\nwon him admiration in the House of Commons. He had prepared to\r\ndistinguish himself as an orator by the elaborate cultivation of his\r\nvoice, which was naturally harsh and shrill. His argumentative force was\r\nrecognized at once, but the full scope of his powers was first shown on\r\nthe 2nd of February 1775, when he spoke on the disputes with the\r\ncolonies. The speech is unfortunately lost, but Gibbon, who heard it,\r\ntold his friend Holroyd (afterwards Earl of Sheffield) that Fox, \"taking\r\nthe vast compass of the question before us, discovered powers for\r\nregular debate which neither his friends hoped nor his enemies dreaded.\"\r\n\r\nHis great political career dates from that day. It is unique among the\r\ncareers of British statesmen of the first rank, for it was passed almost\r\nwholly in opposition. Except for a few months in 1782 and 1783, and\r\nagain for a few months before his death in 1806, he was out of office.\r\nIf he was absolutely sincere in the statement he made to his friend\r\nFitzpatrick, in a letter of the 3rd of February 1778, his life was all\r\nhe could have wished. \"I am,\" he wrote, \"certainly ambitious by nature,\r\nbut I really have, or think I have, totally subdued that passion. I have\r\nstill as much vanity as ever, which is a happier passion by far, because\r\ngreat reputation I think I may acquire and keep, great situation I never\r\ncan acquire, nor if acquired keep, without making sacrifices that I\r\nnever will make.\" His words show that he judged himself and read the\r\nfuture accurately. Yet it was certainly a cause of bitter disappointment\r\nto him that he had to stand by while the country was in his opinion not\r\nonly misgoverned, but led to ruin. His reputation as an orator and a\r\npolitical critic, which was great from the first and grew as he lived,\r\nmost assuredly did not console him for his impotence as a statesman. Of\r\nthe causes which rendered his brilliant capacity useless for the purpose\r\nof obtaining practical success the most important, perhaps the only one\r\nof real importance, was his personal character. Lord John Russell\r\n(afterwards Earl Russell), his friendly biographer, has to confess that\r\nFox might have joined in the confession of Mirabeau: \"The public cause\r\nsuffers for the immoralities of my youth.\" His reputation as a rake and\r\ngambler was so well established at the very beginning of his career that\r\nwhen he was dismissed from office in 1774 there was a general belief\r\namong the vulgar that he had been detected in actual theft. His perfect\r\nopenness, the notoriety of his bankruptcies and of the seizure of his\r\nbooks and furniture in execution, kept him before the world as a model\r\nof dissipation. In 1776, when he was leading the resistance to Lord\r\nNorth's colonial policy, he \"neither abandoned gaming nor his rakish\r\nlife. He was seldom in bed before five in the morning nor out of it\r\nbefore two at noon.\" At the most important crisis of his life in 1783,\r\nhe almost made an ostentation of disorder and of indifference not only\r\nto appearances, but even to decency. Horace Walpole has drawn a picture\r\nof him at that time which Lord Holland, Fox's beloved and admiring\r\nnephew, speaking from his early recollections of his uncle, confesses\r\nhas \"some justification.\" Coming from such an authority the certificate\r\nmay be held to confirm the substantial accuracy of Walpole. \"Fox lodged\r\nin St James's Street, and as soon as he rose, which was very late, had a\r\nlevee of his followers and of the gaming club at Brooks's--all his\r\ndisciples. His bristly black person, and shagged breast quite open and\r\nrarely purified by any ablutions, was wrapped in a foul linen nightgown\r\nand his bushy hair dishevelled. In these cynic weeds and with Epicurean\r\ngood humour did he dictate his politics, and in this school did the heir\r\nof the empire attend his lessons and imbibe them.\" That this cynic\r\nmanner, and Epicurean speech, were only the outside of a manly and\r\ngenerous nature was well known to the personal friends of Fox, and is\r\nnow universally allowed. But by the bulk of his contemporaries, who\r\ncould not fail to see the weaknesses he ostentatiously displayed, Fox\r\nwas, not unnaturally, suspected as being immoral and untrustworthy.\r\nTherefore when he came into collision with the will of the king he\r\nfailed to secure the confidence of the nation which was his only\r\nsupport. Nor ought any critical admirer of Fox to deny that George III.\r\nwas not wholly wrong when he said that the great orator \"was totally\r\ndestitute of discretion and sound judgment.\" Fox made many mistakes, due\r\nin some cases to vehemence of temperament, and in others only to be\r\nascribed to want of sagacity. That he fought unpopular causes is a very\r\ninsufficient explanation of his failure as a practical statesman. He\r\ncould have profited by the reaction which followed popular excitement\r\nbut for his bad reputation and his want of discretion.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight years between his expulsion from office in 1774 and the\r\nfall of Lord North's ministry in March 1782 he may indeed be said to\r\nhave done one very great thing in politics. He planted the seed of the\r\nmodern Liberal party as opposed to the pure Whigs. In political\r\nallegiance he became a member of the Rockingham party and worked in\r\nalliance with the marquis and with Burke, whose influence on him was\r\ngreat. In opposing the attempt to coerce the American colonists, and in\r\nassailing the waste and corruption of Lord North's administration, as\r\nwell as the undue influence of the crown, he was at one with the\r\nRockingham Whigs. During the agitation against corruption, and in favour\r\nof honest management of the public money, which was very strong between\r\n1779 and 1782, he and they worked heartily together. It had a\r\nconsiderable effect, and prepared the way for the reforms begun by Burke\r\nand continued by Pitt. But if Fox learnt much from Burke he learnt with\r\noriginality. He declined to accept the revolution settlement as final,\r\nor to think with Burke that the constitution of the House of Commons\r\ncould not be bettered. Fox acquired the conviction that, if the House\r\nwas to be made an efficient instrument for restraining the interference\r\nof the king and for securing good government, it must cease to be filled\r\nto a very large extent by the nominees of boroughmongers and the\r\ntreasury. He became a strong advocate for parliamentary reform. In all\r\nways he was the ardent advocate of what have in later times been known\r\nas \"Liberal causes,\" the removal of all religious disabilities and\r\ntests, the suppression of private interests which hampered the public\r\ngood, the abolition of the slave trade, and the emancipation of all\r\nclasses and races of men from the strict control of authority.\r\n\r\nA detailed account of his activity from 1774 to 1782 would entail the\r\nmention of every crisis of the American War of Independence and of every\r\nserious debate in parliament. Throughout the struggle Fox was uniformly\r\nopposed to the coercion of the colonies and was the untiring critic of\r\nLord North. While the result must be held to prove that he was right, he\r\nprepared future difficulties for himself by the fury of his language. He\r\nwas the last man in the world to act on the worldly-wise maxim that an\r\nenemy should always be treated as if he may one day be a friend, and a\r\nfriend as if he might become an enemy. On the 29th of November 1779 Fox\r\nwas wounded in a duel with Mr William Adam, a supporter of Lord North's\r\nwhom he had savagely denounced. He assailed Lord North with unmeasured\r\ninvective, directed not only at his policy but at his personal\r\ncharacter, though he well knew that the prime minister was an amiable\r\nthough pliable man, who remained in office against his own wish, in\r\ndeference to the king who appealed to his loyalty. When the disasters of\r\nthe American war had at last made a change of ministry necessary, and\r\nthe king applied to the Whigs, through the intermediary of Lord\r\nShelburne, Fox made a very serious mistake in persuading the marquess of\r\nRockingham not to insist on dealing directly with the sovereign. The\r\nresult was the formation of a cabinet belonging, in Fox's own words,\r\npartly to the king and partly to the country--that is to say, partly of\r\nWhigs who wished to restrain the king, and partly of the king's friends,\r\nrepresented by Lord Shelburne, whose real function was to baffle the\r\nWhigs. Dissensions began from the first, and were peculiarly acute\r\nbetween Shelburne and Fox, the two secretaries of state. The old\r\ndivision of duties by which the southern secretary had the\r\ncorrespondence with the colonies and the western powers of Europe, and\r\nthe northern secretary with the others, had been abolished on the\r\nformation of the Rockingham cabinet. All foreign affairs were entrusted\r\nto Fox. Lord Shelburne meddled in the negotiations for the peace at\r\nParis. He also persuaded his colleagues to grant some rather scandalous\r\npensions, and Fox's acquiescence in this abuse after his recent\r\nagitation against Lord North's waste did him injury. When the marquess\r\nof Rockingham died on the 1st of July 1782, and the king offered the\r\npremiership to Shelburne, Fox resigned, and was followed by a part of\r\nthe Rockingham Whigs.\r\n\r\nIn refusing to serve under Shelburne he was undoubtedly consistent, but\r\nhis next step was ruinous to himself and his party. On the 14th of\r\nFebruary 1783 he formed a coalition with Lord North, based as they\r\ndeclared on \"mutual goodwill and confidence.\" Plausible excuses were\r\nmade for the alliance, but to the country at large this union, formed\r\nwith a man whom he had denounced for years, had the appearance of an\r\nunscrupulous conspiracy to obtain office on any terms. In the House of\r\nCommons the coalition was strong enough to drive Shelburne from office\r\non the 24th of February. The king made a prolonged resistance to the\r\npressure put on him to accept Fox and North as his ministers (see PITT,\r\nWILLIAM). On the 2nd of April he was constrained to submit to the\r\nformation of a new ministry, in which the duke of Portland was prime\r\nminister and Fox and North were secretaries of state. The new\r\nadministration was ill liked by some of the followers of both. Fox\r\nincreased its unpopularity both in the House and in the country by\r\nconsenting against the wish of most of his colleagues to ask for the\r\ngrant of a sum of L100,000 a year to the prince of Wales. The act had\r\nthe appearance of a deliberate offence to the king, who was on bad terms\r\nwith his son. The magnitude of the sum, and his acquiescence in the\r\ngrant of pensions by the Shelburne ministry, convinced the country that\r\nhis zeal for economy was hypocritical. The introduction of the India\r\nBill in November 1783 alarmed many vested interests, and offended the\r\nking by the provision which gave the patronage of India to a commission\r\nto be named by the ministry and removable only by parliament. The\r\ncoalition, and Fox in particular, were assailed in a torrent of most\r\ntelling invective and caricature. Encouraged by the growing unpopularity\r\nof his ministers, George III. gave it to be understood that he would not\r\nlook upon any member of the House of Lords who voted for the India Bill\r\nas his friend. The bill was thrown out in the upper House on the 17th of\r\nDecember, and next day the king dismissed his ministers.\r\n\r\nFox now went into opposition again. The remainder of his life may be\r\ndivided into four portions--his opposition to Pitt during the session of\r\n1784; his parliamentary activity till his secession in 1797; his\r\nretirement till 1800; his return to activity and his short tenure of\r\noffice before his death in 1806. During the first of these periods he\r\ndeepened his unpopularity by assailing the undoubted prerogatives of the\r\ncrown, by claiming for the House of Commons the right to override not\r\nonly the king and the Lords but the opinion of the country, and by\r\nresisting a dissolution. This last pretension came very ill from a\r\nstatesman who in 1780 had advocated yearly elections. He lost ground\r\ndaily before the steady good judgment and unblemished character of Pitt.\r\nWhen parliament was dissolved at the end of the session of 1784, the\r\ncountry showed its sentiments by unseating 180 of the followers of Fox\r\nand North. Immense harm was done to both by the publication of a book\r\ncalled _The Beauties of Fox, North and Burke_, a compilation of their\r\nabuse of one another in recent years.\r\n\r\nFox himself was elected for Westminster with fewer votes than Admiral\r\nLord Hood, but with a majority over the ministerial candidate, Sir Cecil\r\nWray. The election was marked by an amazing outflow of caricatures and\r\nsquibs, by weeks of rioting in which Lord Hood's sailors fought pitched\r\nbattles in St James's Street with Fox's hackney coachmen, and by the\r\nintrepid canvassing of Whig ladies. The beautiful duchess of Devonshire\r\n(Georgiana Spencer) is said to have won at least one vote for Fox by\r\nkissing a shoemaker who had a romantic idea of what constituted a\r\ndesirable bribe. The high bailiff refused to make a return, and the\r\nconfirmation of Fox's election was delayed by the somewhat mean action\r\nof the ministry. He had, however, been chosen for Kirkwall, and could\r\nfight his cause in the House. In the end he recovered damages from the\r\nhigh bailiff. In his place in parliament he sometimes supported Pitt and\r\nsometimes opposed him with effect. His criticism on the ministers' bill\r\nfor the government of India was sound in principle, though the evils he\r\nforesaw did not arise. Little excuse can be made for his opposition to\r\nPitt's commercial policy towards Ireland. But as Fox on this occasion\r\naided the vested interests of some English manufacturers he secured a\r\ncertain revival of popularity. His support of Pitt's Reform Bill was\r\nqualified by a just dislike of the ministers' proposal to treat the\r\npossession of the franchise by a constituency as a property and not as a\r\ntrust. His unsuccessful opposition to the commercial treaty with France\r\nin 1787 was unwise and most injurious to himself. He committed himself\r\nto the proposition that France was the natural enemy of Great Britain, a\r\nsaying often quoted against him in coming years. It has been excused on\r\nthe ground that when he said France he meant the aggressive house of\r\nBourbon. A statesman whose words have to be interpreted by an esoteric\r\nmeaning cannot fairly complain if he is often misunderstood. In 1788 he\r\ntravelled in Italy, but returned in haste on hearing of the illness of\r\nthe king. Fox supported the claim of the prince of Wales to the regency\r\nas a right, a doctrine which provoked Pitt into declaring that he would\r\n\"unwhig the gentleman for the rest of his life.\" The friendship between\r\nhim and the prince of Wales (see GEORGE IV.) was always injurious to\r\nFox. In 1787 he was misled by the prince's ambiguous assurances into\r\ndenying the marriage with Mrs Fitzherbert. On discovering that he had\r\nbeen deceived he broke off all relations with the prince for a year, but\r\ntheir alliance was renewed. During these years he was always in favour\r\nof whatever measures could be described as favourable to emancipation\r\nand to humanity. He actively promoted the impeachment of Warren\r\nHastings, which had the support of Pitt. He was always in favour of the\r\nabolition of the slave trade (which he actually effected during his\r\nshort tenure of office in 1806), of the repeal of the Test Acts, and of\r\nconcessions to the Roman Catholics, both in Great Britain and in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution affected Fox profoundly. Together with almost all\r\nhis countrymen he welcomed the meeting of the states-general in 1789 as\r\nthe downfall of a despotism hostile to Great Britain. But when the\r\ndevelopment of the Revolution caused a general reaction, he adhered\r\nstoutly to his opinion that the Revolution was essentially just and\r\nought not to be condemned for its errors or even for its crimes. As a\r\nnatural consequence he was the steady opponent of Pitt's foreign policy,\r\nwhich he condemned as a species of crusade against freedom in the\r\ninterest of despotism. Between 1790 and 1800 his unpopularity reached\r\nits height. He was left almost alone in parliament, and was denounced as\r\nthe enemy of his country. On the 6th of May 1791 occurred the painful\r\nscene in the House of Commons, in which Burke renounced his friendship.\r\nIn 1792 there was some vague talk of a coalition between him and Pitt,\r\nwhich came to nothing. It should be noted that the scene with Burke took\r\nplace in the course of the debate on the Quebec Bill, in which Fox\r\ndisplayed real statesmanship by criticizing the division of Upper from\r\nLower Canada, and other provisions of the bill, which in the end proved\r\nso injurious as to be unworkable. In this year he carried the Libel\r\nBill. In 1792 his ally, the duke of Portland, and most of his party left\r\nhim. In 1797 he withdrew from parliament, and only came forward in 1798\r\nto reaffirm the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people at a great\r\nWhig dinner. On the 9th of May he was dismissed from the privy council.\r\n\r\nThe interval of secession was perhaps the happiest in his life. In 1783\r\nhe formed a connexion with Elizabeth Bridget Cane, commonly known as Mrs\r\nArmstead or Armistead, an amiable and well-mannered woman to whom he\r\nwas passionately attached. In company with her he established himself at\r\nSt Anne's Hill near Chertsey in Surrey. In 1795 he married her\r\nprivately, but did not avow his marriage till 1802. In his letters he\r\nspoke of her always as Mrs Armistead, and some of his friends--Mr Coke\r\nof Holkham, afterwards Lord Leicester, with whom he stayed every year,\r\nbeing one of them--would not invite her to their houses. It is hard to\r\nexplain this solitary instance of shabby conduct in a thoroughly\r\ngenerous man towards a person to whom he was unalterably attached and\r\nwho fully deserved his affection. Fox's time at St Anne's was largely\r\nspent in gardening, in the enjoyment of the country, and in\r\ncorrespondence on literary subjects with his nephew, the 3rd Lord\r\nHolland, and with Gilbert Wakefield, the editor of Euripides. His\r\nletters show that he had a very sincere love for, and an enlightened\r\nappreciation of, good literature. Greek and Italian were his first\r\nfavourites, but he was well read in English literature and in French,\r\nand acquired some knowledge of Spanish. His favourite authors were\r\nEuripides, Virgil and Racine, whom he defends against the stock\r\ncriticisms of the admirers of Corneille with equal zeal and insight.\r\n\r\nFox reappeared in parliament to take part in the vote of censure on\r\nministers for declining Napoleon's overtures for a peace. The fall of\r\nPitt's first ministry and the formation of the Addington cabinet, the\r\npeace of Amiens, and the establishment of Napoleon as first consul with\r\nall the powers of a military despot, seemed to offer Fox a chance of\r\nresuming power in public life. The struggle with Jacobinism was over,\r\nand he could have no hesitation in supporting resistance to a successful\r\ngeneral who ruled by the sword, and who pursued a policy of perpetual\r\naggression. During 1802 he visited Paris in company with his wife. An\r\naccount of his journey was published in 1811 by his secretary, Mr\r\nTrotter, in an otherwise poor book of reminiscence. It gives an\r\nattractive picture of Fox's good-humour, and of his enjoyment of the\r\n\"species of minor comedy which is constantly exhibited in common life.\"\r\nHis main purpose in visiting Paris was to superintend the transcription\r\nof the correspondence of Barillon, which he needed for his proposed life\r\nof James II. The book was never finished, but the fragment he completed\r\nwas published in 1808, and was translated into French by Armand Carrel\r\nin 1846. Fox was not favourably impressed by Napoleon. He saw a good\r\ndeal of French society, and was himself much admired for his hearty\r\ndefence of his rival Pitt against a foolish charge of encouraging plots\r\nfor Napoleon's assassination. On his return he resumed his regular\r\nattendance in the House of Commons. The history of the renewal of the\r\nwar, of the fall of Addington's ministry, and of the formation of Pitt's\r\nsecond administration is so fully dealt with in the article on Pitt\r\n(q.v.) that it need not be repeated here.\r\n\r\nThe death of Pitt left Fox so manifestly the foremost man in public life\r\nthat the king could no longer hope to exclude him from office. The\r\nformation of a ministry was entrusted by the king to Lord Grenville, but\r\nwhen he named Fox as his proposed secretary of state for foreign affairs\r\nGeorge III. accepted him without demur. Indeed his hostility seems to a\r\nlarge extent to have died out. A long period of office might now have\r\nappeared to lie before Fox, but his health was undermined. Had he lived\r\nit may be considered as certain that the war with Napoleon would have\r\nbeen conducted with a vigour which was much wanting during the next few\r\nyears. In domestic politics Fox had no time to do more than insist on\r\nthe abolition of the slave trade. He, like Pitt, was compelled to bow to\r\nthe king's invincible determination not to allow the emancipation of the\r\nRoman Catholics. When a French adventurer calling himself Guillet de la\r\nGevrilliere, whom Fox at first \"did the honour to take for a spy,\" came\r\nto him with a scheme for the murder of Napoleon, he sent a warning on\r\nthe 20th of February to Talleyrand. The incident gave him an opportunity\r\nfor reopening negotiations for peace. A correspondence ensued, and\r\nBritish envoys were sent to Paris. But Fox was soon convinced that the\r\nFrench ministers were playing a false game. He was resolved not to treat\r\napart from Russia, then the ally of Great Britain, nor to consent to\r\nthe surrender of Sicily, which Napoleon insisted upon, unless full\r\ncompensation could be obtained for King Ferdinand. The later stages of\r\nthe negotiation were not directed by Fox, but by colleagues who took\r\nover his work at the foreign office when his health began to fail in the\r\nsummer of 1806. He showed symptoms of dropsy, and operations only\r\nprocured him temporary relief. After carrying his motion for the\r\nabolition of the slave trade on the 10th of June, he was forced to give\r\nup attendance in parliament, and he died in the house of the duke of\r\nDevonshire, at Chiswick, on the 13th of September 1806. His wife\r\nsurvived him till the 8th of July 1842. No children were born of the\r\nmarriage. Fox is buried in Westminster Abbey by the side of Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe striking personal appearance of Fox has been rendered very familiar\r\nby portraits and by innumerable caricatures. The latter were no doubt\r\ndeliberately exaggerated, and yet a comparison between the head of Fox\r\nin Sayer's plate \"Carlo Khan's triumphal entry into Leadenhall,\" and in\r\nAbbot's portrait, shows that the caricaturist did not depart from the\r\noriginal. Fox was twice painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, once when young\r\nin a group with Lady Sarah Bunbury and Lady Susan Strangeways, and once\r\nat full length. A half-length portrait by the German painter, Karl Anton\r\nHickel, is in the National Portrait Gallery, where there is also a\r\nterra-cotta bust by Nollekens.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The materials for a life of Fox were first collected by\r\n  his nephew, Lord Holland, and were then revised and rearranged by Mr\r\n  Allen and Lord John Russell. These materials appear as _Memoirs and\r\n  Correspondence of C.J. Fox_ (London, 1853-1857). On them Lord John\r\n  Russell based his _Life and Times of C.J. Fox_ (London, 1859-1866);\r\n  Sir G.O. Trevelyan's _Early History of C.J. Fox_ (London. 1880) brings\r\n  new evidence; _Charles James Fox, a Political Study_, by J.L. Le B.\r\n  Hammond (London, 1903), is a series of studies written by an extreme\r\n  admirer. His _Speeches_ were collected and published in 1815. The\r\n  newspaper articles (e.g. in _The Times_) published on the occasion of\r\n  the centenary of his death contain interesting appreciations. See also\r\n  Lloyd Sanders, _The Holland House Circle_ (1908).     (D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX, EDWARD (c. 1496-1538), bishop of Hereford, was born about 1496 at\r\nDursley in Gloucestershire; he is said on very doubtful authority to\r\nhave been related to Richard Fox (q.v.). From Eton he proceeded to\r\nKing's College, Cambridge, and after graduating was made secretary to\r\nWolsey. In 1528 he was sent with Gardiner to Rome to obtain from Clement\r\nVII. a decretal commission for the trial and decision of the case\r\nbetween Henry VIII. and Catherine of Aragon. On his return he was\r\nelected provost of King's College, and in August 1529 was the means of\r\nconveying to the king Cranmer's historic advice that he should apply to\r\nthe universities of Europe rather than to the pope. This introduction\r\nled eventually to Cranmer's promotion over Fox's head to the\r\narchbishopric of Canterbury. After a brief mission to Paris in October\r\n1529, Fox in January 1530 befriended Latimer at Cambridge and took an\r\nactive part in persuading that university and Oxford to decide in the\r\nking's favour. He was sent to employ similar methods of persuasion at\r\nthe French universities in 1530-1531, and was also engaged in\r\nnegotiating a closer league between England and France. In April 1533 he\r\nwas prolocutor of convocation when it decided against the validity of\r\nHenry's marriage with Catherine, and in 1534 published his treatise _De\r\nvera differentia regiae potestatis et ecclesiae_ (second ed. 1538,\r\nEnglish transl. 1548). Various ecclesiastical preferments were now\r\ngranted him, including the archdeaconry of Leicester (1531) and the\r\nbishopric of Hereford (1535). In 1535-1536 he was sent to Germany to\r\ndiscuss the basis of a political and theological understanding with the\r\nLutheran princes and divines, and had several interviews with Luther,\r\nwho could not be persuaded of the justice of Henry VIII.'s divorce. The\r\nprincipal result of the mission was the Wittenberg articles of 1536,\r\nwhich had no slight influence on the English Ten Articles of the same\r\nyear. Bucer dedicated to him in 1536 his _Commentaries on the Gospels_,\r\nand Fox's Protestantism was also illustrated by his patronage of\r\nAlexander Aless, whom he defended before Convocation. Fox is credited\r\nwith the authorship of several proverbial sayings, such as \"the surest\r\nway to peace is a constant preparedness for war\" and \"time and I will\r\nchallenge any two in the world.\" The former at any rate is only a\r\nvariation of the Latin _si vis pacem, para bellum_, and probably the\r\nlatter is not more original in Fox than in Philip II., to whom it is\r\nusually ascribed. Fox died on the 8th of May 1538 and was buried in the\r\nchurch of St Mary Mounthaw, London. His chief distinction is perhaps\r\nthat he was the most Lutheran of Henry VIII.'s bishops, and was largely\r\nresponsible for the Ten Articles of 1536.\r\n\r\n  See _Letters and Papers of Henry VIII._, vols. iv.-xiv.; Cooper's\r\n  _Athenae Cantabrigienses_; _Dict.
